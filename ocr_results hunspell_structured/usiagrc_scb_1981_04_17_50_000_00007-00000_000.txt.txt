Looking at the prospective perspective 3'

profs are known as “Grinnell legends “
so i simply complimented my friends
on their class choices

The school-run tour showed them
Read Hall as the typical dorm. I showed
them Dibble. When I asked if they had
seen the Holiday inn yet. they didn't
know what I was talking about, They
understood when they saw Norris,
though.

Meals aways prove to be an adven-
ture, even for the veteran Grinnellians
My friends were given a choice. A smile
ing admissions person told them,
“Well, you can eat in a nice building or
you can get better food in an ugly,
buildingi" How up-front and honest of
them, I was impressed Then again, is
there a real ditlerenee in lood quality
between Quad and Cowles?

All in all, it was a perfectly program»

On April 10, Grinnell's Office of Ad-
missmns held a ”Spring Reception,“
(another will be held April 24), for those
students admitted to the college. The
purpose at these prospective weekends
is, no doubt. to provide the students
with an opportunity to learn more about
Grinnell. Such weekends have been in
existence for quite a few years and by
now are an integral part of the school.
These weekends are, sometimes, just
as much fun for the current students as
they are for the up-andeomlng Grine
nellians themselves

Aside trom the mysterious correla-
tion between prospective days and bet
ter meals, watching a prospective stu-
dent react to some of the more atypical
things which can be lound on the Grins
nell campus may be amusing. After all,
it isn't every day that one sees people
walking around wearing dog collars or
orange mohawks.

Two friends of mine were among
those who were treated to the Admis
Sions Office's public relations parade
this past weekend and they related to
me their experiences with the catering
of the administration.

They arrived and hesitantly met with
the aristocracy in Grinnell's ad
ministration. Speeches, speeches and
more speeches} After surviving the
continental breakfast (juice and
donuts) served in the Forum, the pro
spective gets to listen to the magical
words of President Drake, Admissions
Director John Hopkins and others,
Although niese speeches may be slight-
ly informative and insightful, my
friends left with a definite ho-hum feel-
ing.

Next, they're off to the interview With
smiling Dick Vos, who smiles more
than usual, knowing that once the

Aplll l 7, 19m

students have been admitted, it's up to
the school to convince them to come.
Everyone in the Admissions Office has
an ultra-brite smile and a "let me make
you feel comfortable" manner. Well, at
least no one wore a leisure suit.

One at the more interesting parts of a
prospective's visit must surely be sit-
ting in on a real college class in action.
Reactions to such visits vary, of course,
depending on which class is visited
Cliff Reid's class sparked the reaction,
"He's so loud!" Ira Strauber's class
brought anxiety and laughter, a rather
odd combination. Then again, these two

med w kend and my friends will most
likely enroll this tall. I’ve always said
that the strongest department at Grinr
hell is Admissions. They really know
what they're dulng.

i remember my prospective weekend
very well. It was last year, die weekend
of Relays. and I had a blast. Oh, il‘ only
those admissions people knew. i never
saw a class, never went on a tour and I
doubt if I ever set foot in the bookstore.
But I'd give almost anything to relive
my introduction to Scotties, “Disaster"
and the BBB Breakfast. And the Relays
even beat the “Booze Cruise" 1 took
part in when I visited Bowdoin. Of
course I enrolled, Wouldn't you?
