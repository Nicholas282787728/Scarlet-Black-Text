Norris flood drains students wallets

by Wki Broderick

Due to a ireak rain-storm, Norris base-
ment ﬂooded around the iirst week oi July,
1932. Seven inches of rain were recorded
during a 24 hour period. As a result, some
students‘ belonging which were being
stored there over the summer were
severely or irreparably damaged.

According to Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Tederman, the high level of water
caused sub-grade dripping across the ceilr
ings of the storage rooms. In other words,
all boxes were subject to water—damage,
not only the ones on the ﬂoor. When asked
why Norris was the only basement ﬂooded,
Tederman said he believed the loggias pro
tected the South Campus storage areas.
However, he could offer no specific ex-
planation as to why the other North Cam—
pus basements also did not ﬂood.

One student estimates damages to his
belongings to be approximately $700.
other students claim damages of up to

Problem
projector
cured

by Kris Potter

Atter causing projectionist’s headaches
and the cancellation of one showing of
M'A'S'H, the college's “best" projector
was sent to Cedar Rapids on Monday
where the distributors will attempt to
repair it this week.

The projector originally malfunctioned
near the end oi the last school year,
establishing a pattern or burning out bulbs
after five to 10 hours of use. (The bulbs are
guaranteed for 1,000 hours.) Repairmen
worked in the ARH projection booth
repeatedly throughout the summer, but a
succession of new parts has failed to cure
rect the elusive problem.

One week before New Student Days the
problem appeared to be tixed. The projec-
tor performed normally during test runs
and until the Aug, 25 showing of M‘A‘S‘ll,
when the bulb blew and that night's show-
ing had to be cancelled. The machine was
checked by service representatives, and
the bulb was replaced for Aug. 26‘s Cat On
a Hot Tin Root, but it burned out just
before Sunday's What's Up, Tiger Lily.
The projectionists, prepared for dit-
ticulties, were able to salvagethat night’s
showing by running the iilm into an old
projector.

The taulty projector, purchased last
year and having approximatley 300 hours
of running time, is a top of the line Eiki
product. It appears that there are only two
other projectors of this kind in lowa, both
at the University or Iowa. “it is the type or
projector that we wanted to have in ARI-I
tor its tine quality," says Performing Pro-
grams Advisor Georgia Dentel. The value
of the projector is that it can show a
featurelength film nonrstop. (In South
Lounge two projectors are used siderby»
side to accommodate the three reels of
most films.)

Ms. Dean hopes to know the tuture oi
the projector wiuiin two weeks. it it cannot
be repaired, a request will be made tor a
new projector,

Until such time as the projector will be
repaired or replaced, films will be shown
on the equipment used in ARI-l prior to get
ting the new projector.

$2,000. ”Many students are understan—
dably upset,” Tederman admitted, “and
feel die college should cover the costs,"
But he also points out that the Physical
Plant stated Hie insurance and storage
procedures in a notice issued to all
students last semester. The insurance
company will pay $25 per box, and addi
tional coverage is available by purchasing
more storage tickem at $2 each.

When asked whether he had any com-
plaints about this set—up, one student
claimed the flooding had caused him “a lot
of wasted expense and time." Moreover,
he feels the school may be partially to
blame. He believes, “They could have
taken (the boxes) out" right after the
flooding instead of letting them sit and sufr
{er mud and mildew damage, and claims
“those were the main causes of the
damage."

Pub unveils fresh new

by Teri Porter

As planned, The Pub and ”’5 restaurant
underwent major renovations over the
summer to transform the draby, cons
gested basement into a clean, roomy,
drinking and eating establishment.

According to Pub Manager Paul Cohen,
the renovations accomplished their pur-
pose by upgrading the atmosphere and in
creasing the work space, while also reduce
ing the congestion and creating a better
ﬂ‘affic flow between The Pub and JJ’s.

The renovations have been going on for
approximately 2% months. According to
Cohen, the bulk of the changes have now
been completed, The installation of a
brand new sound system is included
among the changes. “We hope to have a lot
of musical entertainment in the evenings
as well as during ‘Happy Hour,‘ " com-
mented Cohen

Other changes include the addition of
[our new large tables obtained from
Cowles Dining Room as well as the repair
of all the old tables. More new tables were
supposed to have been installed, but Cohen
noted, “We ran over our budget in renova»
tions and didn't have any money lett over
to purchase tables."

Last spring, the cost of renovations was
estimated at $7,000. Cohen stated that the
cost is “over $10,000 now, but all the bills
haven't come in yet." These other bills will
include the cost of finishing the work and
paying labor,

The work that still needs completing in-
cludes installing a coat rackrand book
storage area, rebuilding the counter
space, and painting murals on the walls.
The murals will be done by those students
whose design proposals are selected by
The Pub. Cohen remarked, “Hopefully,
everything will be completed within two
weeks."

The renovations have gone smoothly ex-
cept tor a few complications. “The major
hang-up was with the electrical work in the
ceiling,” explained Cohen. There were
other minor problems which “were just a
matter of taking the time to check the
regulations and correct the situation.”

Cohen believes the new design will bring
in more business, lie explained, “I'm sure
people have been curious to see the new

changes. They're going to be more willing
to come down here because it’s a more
pleasant place to be.”

The public response, in Cohen's opinion,
has been positive overall. He remarked,
“The only real complaint I've heard is that
the walls are too white." The walls are
white because the color “provides a good
background for the murals," and the situar
tion will be remedied when the murals are
painted.

The renovations also affect JJ’s
resmurant since it is located right next to
The Pub. Minors who wanted to enter JJ's
last year found it impossible because the
only entrance into the restaurant was
through The Pub. A major change in the
floor plan is that the door to both JJ'S and
The Pub is located within the restaurant.

restaurant will beneiit from the renova-
tlons e mainly because “the door is right
there and people have to pass through the
restaurant to get into The Pub."

Block believes the major advantage at
the changes will be that “anybody who is
any age can get into JJ's, sit down, out and
basically do anything they want. AS long
as they (minors) don't go into The Pub.
there won’t be any hassles.”

“Happy Hour" in The Pub is irom 4 p.m.
to 6:30 pm. Closing time is 1:30 p.m. on
weeknights and 1:45 a,m on weekends.
The Pub is closed on Sundays.

available in about one week.
