Rozanova‘s work is important as one oi
the earliest examples oi purely noo-

Rozanova‘s work was the inundation upon
which Matisse built his non-objective art
some iiity years later.

The Rozanuva series is being loaned to
Grinnell by Louise Noun, in whose honor
the Noun Chair in Women's Studies is nam-
ed. Noun will give a gallery talk about the
Universal War series on Thursday, 0c
