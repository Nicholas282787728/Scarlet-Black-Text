Women’s Group sets goals

by Barb Ruler

When Coordinator Mary Schulze call»
ed the first Women’s Group meeting
this year, she was overwhelmed with
the response; approximately 50 people,

'including several men gathered on
Thursday, Sept. 11 to discuss the goals
of the Women’s Group.

The main discussion at the meeting
centered around the focus of the group
this year. Someone brought up the idea
that the group was a humanitarian
group, not just a women’s group, and
the focus or maybe the title of the group
was misleading. After some debate the
original focusi the focus on women~
was realiirrned. The men’s role in the
group was then discussed. The large
number of men at the meeting shows an
obvious interest is present on campus.
Jii'n Hunter suggested a men’s con-
sciousness raising group be formed,
where men’s roles can be discussed,
especially in regard to women’s issues
and to sex stereotypes.

Ten men signed up to participate in
this discussion group, in which the con»
versation will center around raising
their consciousness to women's issues,
breaking out of male stereotypes, and
any problems they may be having
relating to current Concerns,

Women’s Group‘s role on campus in
one of service to campus women. One of
their programs is the shuttle service to
Cedar Rapids Clinics {or women. The
shuttle provides transportation to
several Women's Healﬂ’l Care facil ies
and provides campus women with ace
cess to some of the country's most pro
gressive women’s health care centers.

Another major concern that Women’s
Group is committed to addressing is the
problem of harassment on campus.
Women‘s Group will be approaching
President George Drake with some
recommendations ior improved
lighting on campus in some strategic
areas of campus, Other concerns are

SGA passes Skip Day resolution

by Barb Rittei

Joint Board highlighted its meeting
last Wednesday with a discussion con-
cerning the once-popular Skip Day.
Hoping to revive the Grinnell tradition
It passed a resolution stating: it a
spring Skip Day, with official sanction
by the iacrdty should be reinstated,
then no Skip Day shall be called or
sanctioned by the SGA during the fall
semester.

The resolution carried after it was
made clear that in the past, an unsanc-
tioned Skip Day would end up with one-
half of the studean going to classes
anyway. Several members argued that
the majority on campus would receive
more benefit from one sanctioned Skip
Day than two unsanctioned ones, The
resolution now goes to the faculty for
their approval.

In other business, Joint Board gave
two new publications support when it

approved amounts of so: and :95 to the _

ass and The iconoclast, respectively.
Gordon Kurtz, spokesperson for the
Blis, gave his reasons for proposing an
alternate campus newspaper as to pro
vide “as wide variety of editorials and
views as possible." His intention is to
make it wide open to campus, not con-
strict it as the egocentric 8818 did last
year. He described the goals of his staff
in terms of “providing inter-
disciplinary, cross cultural, wide open,
and highly polished— but most of all as
written by other people.” The
Iconoclast, described as basically a
politically oriented paper, requested
funding to enable the staff to put out
their first issue of the paper while they
work on a self-financing program for
future issues. The Iconoclast will not
only be distributed on campus, but in

September 19, won

town as well.

Several committee approvals were
made at Wednesday's meeting. Mark
Salmanson was approved to IF; Eric
Secoy to the PASF, Both Pam Hulnik
and Carl Dukstein were appointed to
the SPR, with Missy Bowen absent
from the meeting, New members to the
Election Board are Bob Kleirle, Vern
Juel, Rob Schwarz. Jan Giffen, Tom
vitt, Deb Withrup. and Laura Ruther-
ford.

the lack of a permanent security pro-
gram on campus for women, The escort
service is dieir temporary solution to
this problem.

The SGA will soon be approached by
Tom McCarthy, Women’s Group
treasurer. Although there is as of yet no
total budget estimates for Women's
Group, it is hoped that SGA will
recognize the need of the services that
Women's Group provides for women on
campus.

McCarthy reflected that “the issue of
feminism brings up questions on the
masculine roles— our roles compared
with your new roles. It can be beneficial
to both sexes and it's really not just a
women’s movement.” While urging all
of campus to support Women’s Group,
he admitted that the “big problem is
money." The group’s only chance at
iunding is through the SGA. as the ad-
ministration has not yet been convinced
of the need for a permanent program
