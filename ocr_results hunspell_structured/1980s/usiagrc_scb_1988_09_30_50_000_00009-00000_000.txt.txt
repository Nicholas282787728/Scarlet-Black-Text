Review of town watercolor exhibit

by Dan Capone

Watercolor: by Carol Stein-
metz of Murcalt'rte is currently
on display at the Grinnell Com»
munity Art Gallery (in the
Community Center, downtown at
the comer of 4th Avenue and
Park Street) The exhibit opened
this past Friday. with a wellrat-
tended wine and cheese reception
for the artist, who gave a short
gallery talk,

The show is rather uneven in
quality, Most of the 27 works
are amteurish ﬂoral composi-
tions. which, while perhaps
"pretty," provide little excitement
or interest beyond their subject
matter, That is not to say how-
ever, that nothing of interest can
be found. Some of her work, in
particular her later work, exhibits
an interest in abstraction. Her
work "Croton" is much less a
study of a plant than an exercise
in abstract patterning. with the
green and yellow-white patches of
the plant intersected by the pink
veins taking on a life of their
own Her "Petunia Floral” also
works well as a color study, an

examination of the combination
of deep. dark reds and greens us-
ing the wet-in—wet technique,

Her strongest works, or at
least those which generate the
most interest, are those which
abandon the ﬂoral motif all to-
gether, Her "Decision Time"
(which won honorable mention
in the Muscatine County Fine
Arts Exhibition, 1986. and was
selected for a juried traveling ex-
hibit by the Iowa Watercolor So
ciety in 1986) is one of these.
The intense, more solid green of
the stoplight and black of the one
way sign pull together and unify
the more muted colors and
washes used in thc‘rest of the
painting. The composition is
rather ﬂat as well, allowing for
more exploration of the abstract
play of light and form. Two
other of her works showing a
strong interest in abstract
patterning are "508 Food Store"
and "Flag Alley, Anchorage
Shopping Center, San Fran-
cisco". In both of these latter
works, the objective reality they
are titled after is increasingly
submerged. and an interest in
color becomes the primary focus.

In viewing the show, it is
important to keep in mind that
she is a self taught mist, and has
worked largely without the bene-
ﬁt of close instruction or the
work of others to foster, chal—

lenge, and provide ideas. Her
later work, which has developed
out of, and she admits owes
much of its nature to. the work»
shop setting she has been study
ing under lately, is clearly more
interesting than her earlier work;
there is simply more going on in
these works. Whatever one's
opinion of these works and esti
mation of their artistic merit,
they clearly communicate an ad

 

mirable enthusiasm and determie
nation,

The show will continue
through the 14th of October.
The works in the exhibit are for
sale, and a number of them have
already sold. The Community
Gallery is open weekdays, from
noon to 4 pm; weekends by ap-
pointment. For more informa-
tion call the Community Art
Gallery at 236-2605 or 236-5403.
