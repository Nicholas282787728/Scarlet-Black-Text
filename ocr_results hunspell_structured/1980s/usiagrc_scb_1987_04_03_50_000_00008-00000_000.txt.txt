“Gaslight,” a 1944 film directed by
George Cukor, is a taut and terrilying
psychological thriller. Set in Victorian
London, "Gaslight” tells of a husband who
attempts to drive his wife insane through
insidious mental mind»games, and thereby
collect her inheritance.

Charles Boyer is the seemingly charm-
ing Frenchman Gregory Anton who mar-
ries the exceedingly naive and trusting
heiress, played by Ingrid Bergman in her
first AcademyaAwardawinning role.
Unbeknownst to her, her deceased aunt
left a cache of jewels hidden in her house
and this is the fuel of Anton's greed. Anton
begins to torment his wife by soothingly
contradicting her statements (“zou must
’ave (oi-gotten, my dear”) and later pro-
gresses to orchestrating mysterious noises
in the attic and positioning a sinister, con-
tinually flickering gaslight in her
bedroom. Before you can say Claus Von
Bulow, our frantic heroine is doubting her
own sanity. 0n the brink of being commit-
ted to an insane asylum by her
“perturbed” husband, Bergman is saved
by a handsome — and eligible e Scotland

Yard detective (Joseph Cotten).
My major gripe with this him (apart
from its length of over two—and-a-hali
hours) is the passivity and unlimited
gullibility of the Bergman character. Not
once does she suspect her husband or even
dare to question his unexplained absences
from the connubial home; one does no
doubt the reasons for Anton's choosing
Bergman as his victim. Nonetheless, this
is a chilling and haunting film. Cukor, hail
ed by many as the consummate “women’s
director” for die attention he lavished 0
his female actresses at the expense of thei
male co-stars, extracts a credible perfor
mance from Bergman, whose luminou
beauty is displayed to good effec
through excellent black-and-wbit
cinematography. Departing from his usual
French playboy roles. Boyer gives a
suitably sinister pertormance as Anton.
Also, watch for a very young Angela
Lansbury in an Oscaranominated suppora
ting role as an insolent Cockney maid.

Fiddler on the Roof

by Ann l-laker

“Fiddler 0n the Roof" is a musical deal-
ing with the oppression oi Jews in pre-
revolutionary Russia. it also is a story of
how a iamily and especially the father,
Tevye (played by Topol), comes to grips
with the changing society. This 1971 film
adaptation of the stage production takes
place in rural Russia, where people have
lived by the same traditions for as long as
anyone cares to remember,

The basic story revolves around a iamily
with iive children, all iemale, and their at
tempts to find suitable husbands. Tradi-
tionally they would be married oiiwnh the
help or a matchmaker and their dowry.
The family, however, is too poor to afford
to pay a dowry and must pick from those
few men who don't care. The three eldest
daughters all find men on their own
without the aid of a matchmaker or —
heaven forbid ~ permission of their
father. Each breaks with tradition a little
more than the last,

The first was promised to another man,
but she refused to be taken away from the
man she loved, The man she chose was at
least acceptable to the parents. The second
wished to marry a young communist, who
could promise her love and little else. He
was sent to Siberia by the government and
she joined him there, The third went much
to far when she chose a gentile, and for

this, Tevye refused to even max at her.
Each married out oi love, something
which is nearly unknown in arranged mar-
riages. The final two children were too
young to enter the marriage game fully,
although they were fixed up with prospecV
tive husbands in the traditional way.

The second plot centers around the
persecution oi the Jews, They are lorced
off the land they have held for generations
and are scattered Many of them went to
America to start over while others went to
the Cities. The government forces were
lead by a man sympathetic to the Jew's
plight but reiused to go out on a limb and
protect the Jews.

There are some wonderful musical
numbers The best is probably a barroom
scene with traditional Russxanastyle dance
ing. Most oi the songs are light and
memorable, and chances are you will
leave the theatre humming “It I were a
rich man.” The film won two minor
Academy Awards and was nominated for
four others. including best picture, direc7
tor. actor, and supporting actor. liyou like
musicals, this is a iairly good one. It is also
very long (three hours) and might be a
chore to sit through.

Beautiful

by Beth Johnson

“My Beautilul Laundrette” is a daring,
reireshing ﬁlm starring Gordon Warnecke
as Omar, a Pakistani teenager and aspire
ing entrepreneur, and Daniel Day Lewis
(unrecognizable from his role in “A Room
with a View”) as Johnny, a South London
punkster fighting to escape from his
despairing and angry street gang,

Omar and his family have been the brunt
of abuse from Johnny and his friends who
believe the “Pakis” fail to know their
place, but the two young men were
childhood playmates and eventually
become passionate lovers. The not-always-
honest business practices of Omar’s uncle
inﬂuence the ways in which Omar and
Johnny translorm a rundown laundrette
(a British laundromat) into a successful
financial venture.

This is a film about wanting something
more out of life. about racial conﬂict and
