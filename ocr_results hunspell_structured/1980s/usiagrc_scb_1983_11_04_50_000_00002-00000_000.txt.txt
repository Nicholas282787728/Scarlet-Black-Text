Wellness Series:

Scarlet £2 Black

Student as whole being

by Joe Neii

Beginning this week and continuing into
next week, Cleveland and 'Main Hall Coun-
cils are sponsoring a stress alleviation
series ,entitled, “Assessing Mind, Body,
and Balance: A Well-Being Seria.” The
series has already presented two
speakers, Prof. Tom Brozoski and LaVeta
Small, and will present three more
speakers next week on the 7th, 9th, and
10th. The series was formed by the two hall
councils in concern for relieving stress
among students.

The series is featuring speakers who will
discuss ways of recognizing and assessing
stress, and different 'ways and techniques
of relieving stress. The series approaches
the student as a whole being 7 an emo-
tional and physical person that must func-
tion in a balance with the mind, not just a
mind that must churn out work,

Some of the techniques in relieving
stress will include: yoga, aerobics, and
nutrition, The series will take a wholistic
approach, advocating that students care
not only tor their thinking minds, but also
for their emotional and physical health.

The program was formed in the hope
that students could learn to be responsible
for their own mental and physical health.
The program is concentrating on teaching
students how to avoid or relieve stress
before it becomes a serious problem, Anita
Wollison, RA for Main and Cleveland
Halls, said that, “The problems for RAS in
dealing with stress is that RAs only see
students after they come in suffering from

Playwright

by Scott Sutherland

It is not often that Americans get to hear
firstrhand of the trials and artistic tribula-
tions that artism under the weight of
repras‘lve governments must endure,
Last week, Grinnell was visited by Polish
playwright Janusz Glowacki, a wistful
black-humorist who has been shut out of
his native country since martial-law took
effect in the winter of 1981. Glowacki
delivered last Thursday’s Scholar’s Con»
vocation and held an informal question
and answer session at a Mortar Board cof-
fee hour.

Glowacki’s Convocation address, entitl-
ed ‘Censorship and the Theatre in Poland,‘
dealt with the problems faced by Writers,
playwrights in particular, as they try to
cope with the weight of government can
sors. The censor is the last hurdle a play
must clear before production, and actors
and directors have been known to utilize
methods bordering on the slapstick to en—
sure that potentially controversial lines
escape the notice of the censor. Glowacki
used an example whereby a director in-
structed his actors to mumble through im-
portant passages in a play, and when a key
line came up that the director wished to
deflect from the censor, he merely cough-
ed and knocked over an ash- t-ray to create
a momentary diversion. The line passed
the censor unnoticed

In a more serious vein, Glowacki spoke
of methods writers use to try and bypass
the ever-present censors. The traditional
memod of disguising social criticism
under layers of metaphor, Glowacki said,
will no doubt continue but will utilize even
more layers of metaphor. Writers, then,
must cope with a tangible barrier to tree
expression, and Glowacki is concerned as
to the degree that this barrier affects
Polish writers.

“There is a problem of self-censorship,"
Glowacki told an interviewer in a January
i981 story in The New York Times. Now
we are in transition, We don’t know how
much of our work and thinking is deter»
mined by censorship This is more really
than just selfrcensorship, because it enters
the realm of the origin of the thought and
the creative idea itself We just don't
know. I wrote ‘Match’ and ‘Cinders’ [two
recent Glowacki plays 1 and both use
metaphor to make a larger point about my
own society. Would I have chosen to write
in that metaphor it there was no censor-
ship and no metaphor needed? It is not
clear, even to me," said Glowacki.

burnout," She sees in the series a chance
to help students discover ways of taking
responsibility for preventing stress. .

Wollison hopes that the series can help
students learn to balance studies with ex-
ercise and relaxation. She Stated,
“Sometimes students get so wrapped up in
just getting this one paper or project done
that they neglect their health to the point
that they become ill or are continually in ill
health.”

The series hopes to demonstrate that
students need to take care of their
psychological stability as well as their
physiological stability. What students tend
to forget is that their physical health often
has a great bearing on their psychological
health.

There are many different causes of
stress. There are the psychosocial causes,
which range from problems of adaptation
to new situations and overload by
spreading oneself too thin, to frustration
and deprivation. The second set of causes
for stress are the biorecological causes.
These are problems with biorhythms,
nutrition, and noise, The third set ofcauses
are attributed to each person’s own per-
sonality: seli perceptions, behavioral pat-
terns and anxiety.

The series will continue on Monday,
Nov. 7, at 8:30 with Yoga in Main Lounge.
Then on Wednesday, Nov. 9, Dave McConr
nell will lecture on “Nutrition and Its Relay
tion to StressH at 9 :30 in Cleveland Lounge,
Finally, on Thursday. Nov. lo, at 9:30 in
Main Longe, Evelyn MinorrLawrence will
hold an aerobics work-out.

The economics of high level

nuclear waste disposal

by M. Wolfgang Schumann

Economics Professor Richard Parker of
the University of Michigan spoke last Fri-
day in ARI-l on ”The Economics of High-
Level Nuclear Waste Disposal". Parker
has been involved in the problems
associated with nuclear waste ever since
the governor of Michigan asked him and
other academics for advice on that state's
situation live years ago, He received his
B.A, from Williams College and his PhD.
from Yale University. Parker has written
books and numerous articles on the sub-
ject of nuclear waste disposal.

About 35 people listened to his speech,
which addressed three major points: what
is wrong with present analyses or the pro»
blem; what economics can't do to help;
and what economics can and should do to
resolve the topic. “There is no social
science more arrogant than economics
about what we Can do. There is no social
science more territorial," said Parker,

There are one hundred nuclear reactors
in the United States, and each one of them
uses up one third of its fuel each year, This
fuel must be removed and replaced; plans
call for the spent fuel to be placed in a
nearby water pool for a few months until it
can be economically moved to a more per»
manent site. “Some of that stuff has been
in those pools ever since. it’s been there as
long as twenty years now.” Almost all
highrlevel radioactive waste is stored in
these “short-term" sites.

Seventy mousand tons of waste material

will be stored by the end of the century if
no new plants are built. The residual fuel
from decommissioned reactors will add to
that figure. Because of this, storage pools
are iilling up rapidly.

The problem, says Parker, is that these
pools are not intended for longrterm
storage. They are not very safe from tel-r
rcrists, vandals, or even earthquakes in
certain areas. “They’re just not
secure,”he says.

“Permanent" storage means at least
one to ten thousand years in the case of
nuclear waste, and that is by moderate
estimates. “It’s an incredible political/s»
clence/eccnomic problem,” declared
Parker. “It isn't just ‘what to do with it’:
it’s a series of questions."

Geological repositories are presently me
most favored long-term option, Among
other suggestions are deepseabed burial,
VDH (Very Deep Hole disposal), and
space ejection, Those have all been re-
jected for reasons or safety, lack of
technology, and cost. respectively. The
repository method is the only alternative
that )5 allordable, technologically feasi-
ble, and relatively safe.

Parker criticized extremists on both
sides of the nuclear issue who argue that
the disposal problem is either unimportant
or ultimately critical. l-le especially cons
demned those who want nuclear energy to
be absolutely, postively, loo percent safe,
saying that nothing could possibly be that
certain,

Glowacki clears censor's hurdles

Glowacki was attending the opening of
his play ‘Cinders' m London when martial
law took effect in his homeland, Glowacki
was separated from his wife and small
daughter, and has not seen thém since he
left for London, Tragedy is no stranger to
Glowacki, however, Born in Warsaw in
1938, he was a small child when the Ger»
mans overran Poland in the early years
of the Second World War. Later, as a boy,
he was subject to the repression and indoor
trination of the Russians that occupied his
country,

Glowacki launched his literary career in
1964 with the writing of an expose that
dealt with the privileged sons and
daughters of party officials and their
materialistic, free-wheeling lifestyles. The

censors sat on the book for [our years until
a new regime came to power. The book
was allowed to be published in 1968,
because it threw discrediting light on cer-
tain party-members that the new govern»
ment wished to purge.

Since then Glowacki has written a
number of plays and novels, and has col»
laborated on films with me Polish director
Andre Wadja, l-lis play ‘Cinders' is a story
based on the fairy-tale of Cinderella which
takes place in a girl’s reform school, An
exploitive filmmaker comes to the school
to film a documentary oi the girls doing
the party~ver5lon of Cinderella. One girl,
Cinders, refuses to recite the Partyrline
despite coercion, and in front of the whirrr
lug camera slits her wrists as a final act of

defiance,

Like the fairytale Cinderella, Cinders is
waiting ior her prince to arrive, which we
can interpret as the arrival or some
avenger that will oust the oppressive
regime, but the powerful filmmaker, the
‘big-brother’ figure, cruelly represses her
efforts to escape the system or to change
it. This thinly disguised description oi the
relationship between Poland and the
Soviet Union prophesized the happenings
of the winter of 1981, when Solidarity was
suddenly snuffed by the marital-law take-
over throughout Poland,

In his novel “Give Us This Day” Glowac-
ki traces the birth and maturation af-the
Solidarity trade union m the shipyards of
Gdansk and its eventual spreading to en-
compass the entire country. Glowacki
spoke sadly of the brutal demise of the
union.

“I am afraid Solidarity didn't have any
chance from the beginning," he said. “The
government never intended to uphold the
agreement it made with Solidarity."

“When I think of what has been done to
the Polish people, now with. . .martiaHaw
and these things, i get so angry," said
Glowacki, clenching his fists.

Anger and frustration have not dimmed
Glowacki’s sense of humor at the absurd
Polish censorship, indeed much of Polish
life, Glowacki said, is “a game, a tragi~
comedy.”

“Everything goes in very strange and
very funny ways in Poland," Glowacki
Said. “What we are allowed to laugh at in
Poland doesn't make anyone laugh. . . . If a
play gets bad reviews, if it is called stupid,
nothing, shit, you know, the people will
flock to see it.”

It would be easy for Glowacki to lapse in-
to despair, burdened as he is by the
sadness and anger caused he and his famir
ly and his nation by the Soviet Union. But
Glowacki is able 'to find a melancholy
humor in the plight of his homeland, and
puts the current situation there into con-
text In his plays by mixing the metaphor
with the absurd, His newest play, “Fortin-
bras Gets Drunk," is his most absurd play
to date and effectively illustrates the
dominance of one nation over another.

“Life in Poland, it is very complicated."
said Glowacki, currently a member of the
International Writing Program at the
University of iowa. “I am trying to write
about very serious things in a very funny
way I think this is the best way for me to
accomplish what i am trying to do ”
