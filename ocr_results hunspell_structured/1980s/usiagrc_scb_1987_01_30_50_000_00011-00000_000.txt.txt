Indoor Track:
On Your Mark...

by Ken Varnum and Justin Lincoln

From the perspective of the coaches Will
and Evelyn Freeman, the season is dawn»
ing more brightly than any they've coach-
ed in their seven years at Grinnell.

For the women. nearly 30 athletes com~
prise a squad which Evelyn thinks “has a
realistic chance to challenge for the con-
Ierence championship." She added that a
low people could qualify ior national com-
petition as well.

Cnscaptains Malinda Collins and Sha-
vaun Adams will spearhead the women's
team’s quest for victory. Their efforts will
be augmented by returning letterwinner
Kim Kuncl. Chris Lawson, Veronika
Platzer. Jenniier Bishop, as well as
newcomers Joanne Sackett, Heidi
Hopkins. Abigail Green. Debra Simons,
Blair Davison. and nearly 20 other
athletes.

”The team is pretty strong across the
board. except tor a lew events here and
there," said coach Evelyn Freeman.

The women will iirst compete on
February 7 at the UNI Invitational on a
track cited by Evelyn as “one of the finest
indoor facilities in the State.” Of the 12
teams to participate. nine. including Iowa
State University and the University of
iIowa. will be Division I schools. Evelyn
said the meet will largely be an
“initiation,” as many team members have
never competed at the college level. She
added that the level of competition will
greatly beneiit Grinnell’s very talented
people,

The men’s squadron is composed of 43
athletes that constitute. according to Will
Freeman, what is “certainly ,.the best in
door team in the seven years we’ve been
here." Freeman notes that the squad is
deep not only in numbers. but also in quali-
ty.

This depth and quality 15 retlected in the
{act that the men's team. like the
women's. is “strong across the board."
They are especially strong in the distance
events. having just come ofl a conference
championship cross-country season

Probable scorers for the Pioneers are
Greg Evans. who holds several School
records in distance running. shotsputter
Henry Vogelman. hurdler/high-jumper
Rob Parker. long-jumper, John Beavers,
and distance runners Phil Lefebvre and
Dave Wisdom. However. Freeman is quick
to point out that any number oi team
members. including several highly
talented ireshmen. are capable 01 con»
iributing to the scoring.

The [irst meet for the men is the Cornell
Invitational in Mt..Vernon. where Cornell
College has erected a brand‘spanking-new
Olympic surface facility. Freeman said
the meet will be “lowskey.” intended
primarily for positioning purposes. and ior
reinstilling Grinnell's competitive spirit.

Both coaches indicated that the collecs
tive team goal is to reach their potential in
every way--in terms or physxcal and men-
tal fitness as well as commitment to the
cause.

Hope For Pro Sports?

by Karin Sedestrom

i hope everyone enjoyed my justification
or why i have this job last week, And now;
on to this week‘s topic.

I don't usually watch professional loot-
ball. I think it has gone over me edge in
commercialism. but when I watched the
Super Bowl on Sunday night. there was a
sign at hope.

For those of you who are uninitiated into
such mysteries of ﬁle, when a certain team
has a certain play. often the diagram of
how the play will be run appears superim-
posed on the screen. as it it were being

last Saturday's women‘s basketball game against Illinois Col|ege. *drawn onachalkboard.

They also keep large buckets oi

Gatorade on a table on the sidelines. il'o
quench the players‘ thirst. Iassume.) This
is just F.Y.l. ,

Watchers of Sunday's Super Bowl were
not only treated to hours oi play, time outs.
and hoopla. but were also shown a
diagram oi exactly how the buckets would
be dumped on Giant's coach Bill Parsells.
Call me an optimist. but.I think that‘s
either a sign that protessional sports can
now laugh at themselves. or that someone
at the station has a sense of humor, It's
either one of these or someone was going to
get tired anyway and this was their last
hurrah I prefer to think that it was the
former.
