How do the costs add up?
The dollars and sense

of living off campus

by Kim MacDonald

Now that room and board will cost
$2,170, you may iind yourself asking, “Is it
really worth paying $2,000" to put up with
all the sundryveVils of life in the dorms?

Certainly there are benefits to living in
the dorms: you never have to cook, there is
plenty of companionship irom the
dorm/dining hall social scene, the laundry
is convenient, a maid cleans the bathroom,
and usually there is toilet paper, On the
other hand, ygu musteat dorm food, rooms
are impersonal and comparable in size to
most proiessor's offices, the college
speciiies when you must vacate and return
to your room, and privacy is at a
minimum, While noise is at a maximum,

There are pros and cons to living either
on or oil campus, and the decision is one of
personal preierence or course, there are
seniors who have lived quite happily in the
dorms [or their entire Gi‘innell experience,
Then again, there are sophomores who can
hardly wait to be allowed to live in an
apartment.

Une oi the most frequently asked ques-
tions is whether it is cheaper to live on or
off campus. Unfortunately. there is no
definitive answer. It is posSible to spend
less money while living on campus, but
one can also spend a small fortune, Cost
depends entirely on your liiestyle and what

Co—op 11v1ng
by Kim MacDonald

For students who either cannot or don't
want to live Oil campus, but find dorm life
a drag, coop living is a good alternative.
Coops are probably the cheapest way to
live in Grinnell, and since the houses are
owned and maintained by the college, they
are in good condition In addition, students
get many of the advantages of living off
campus without having to deal with
landlords, heat and electricity bills and
other upkeep aspects oi the house

There are drawbacks though. Co-ops are
large, generally ranging in size from nine
to 15 people, and underclassmeri still must
share rooms. Although homier than a
dorm, a co-Qp still opens and closes [or
chirstmas and spring breaks. Butior
students tired of on campus,liie, co;,op’s
are the next best thing to living oil campus
without some oi the hassles.

you are willing to sacriiice. Again. that is a
personal decision. Many students who are
now living on campus agree that it costs a
few hundred dollars more to live off cams
pus, but the benefits of life outside the
dorms are worth the extra cost,

The closer to campus and the larger the
apartment, the higher the rent will be.
Privacy comes at a price, since most
single apartments Cost about $150 or more
per month. Rent per person, in a shared
apartment, generally ranges from $75 to
$130 per month If you share a bedroom,
rent will be even cheaper,

Some landlords include heat and/or elec-
tricity, while others expect the tenant to
pay ior utilities directly in some ways,
rent which includes utilities is a better
deal, since it the tenant does not ever see
the heat bill, he or she will tend to keep the
thermostat at a much more comfortable
setting. It you are a cold-blooded person,
opt for a utilities included apartment and
you'll have a much more pleasant winter.
However, if the cold doesn‘t bother you, or
ii you really need to save money, pay ior
your own heat, However, unless you keep
your thermostat below 65 degrees all
winter, you will generally spend as much
on heat and rent as a person whose utilities
are included,

proves to be

Food seems to be the major benefit of co-
up life and the reason why most people
move into co-ops. “We eat really well,” ac-
cording to Joanne Warner, a sophomore
who moved into German House because
she didn't want to eat on board but was not
allowed in live off Campus. Her housemate
Sue Brinkmann agreed, adding that “The
eating situation is a lot more relaxed and
you cook what you want.” The “main focus
is food” in French-Veggie House explained
Kate Potter. The seven women who live in
1130 East Street are all vegetarians who,
Potter claims, are “all good cooks with a
similar interest in i‘ood." Dan Schue and
Peter Lydecker, both residents of Russian
House, also agree the food is much more
enjoyable ‘

vIn addition to eating better, coop '
residents also spend less money than they

 

 

Electricity is usually a minimal ex»
pense, but to keep bills low requires a
degree or responsibility about turning oil
lights, stereos, and electric blankets that
one doesn't always exercise when living in
a dorm. _Bills can run anywhere from $4 to
$12 depending on one‘s habits, how big the
house is, and the time of year. Space
heaters, televisions and clothes dryers are
some or the biggest energy users,

The cost of food when living off campus
is totally relative to was eating habits,
shopping practices and willingness to
sacriiice. Some people buy powdered milk,
vegetable spread and lots of frozen bur-
ritos. Thus, they spend less than they
would to eat on board. However,
households that eat butter, meat, and lots
or cheese tend to spend more. coop buying
saves a reasonable amount oi money, as
does buying on sale and avoiding red
meat. A general expense range ior iood ior
one person for a semester ranges from
$200 to $400, with the average being about
$300,

Other expense CDHSlderations for living
oil campus include whether the apartment
is furnished. and if so. whether you will
have to pay a “fixtures fee” to the current
tenant Ii it is not furnished, can you acs
quire the basics (like a bed) cheaply'7

the cheapest

would to eat on board. Board currently
cost $610 per semester, whereas people
who live in co-ops spend irom 3230 to $340 a
semster for food in addition to a slight ex-
tra charge [or co-op board. Most co-op's
have dinners four to seven nights a week,
and students tend ior themselves the rest
of the week.

Aside from the iood, many students
perier the atmosphere oi their houses to
that oi a dorm. “You have a home instead

L hours."

otten students need to buy some kitchen
equipment, so it is good to see what is
already there and beg, borrow or steal the
rest irom your mother. Grandparents and
relatives are good sources for old dishes.
and silverware. Start asking ior things like
woks and coiieernakers ior Christmas and
birthday presents, Also, some nice
landlords are even willing to lend kitchen
equipment and beds.

One major fact to keep in mind is that
most leases run irom May to May. In other
words, ii you sign a lease and you don't
plan to summer in Grinnell, you are still
responsible ior paying rent in June, July
and August. In Grinnell summer apart-
ments are a subleter's market. So cunsider
asking ior as little as half your monthly
rent rather than let your apartment sit
empty all summer while you shell out iull
rent to your landlord. In addition, it is nice
to know that someone is watching over
your stereo, television and other belongs
ings stored in your apartment over the
summer

Finally, set up a budget' in the beginning
oi the year and try to stick to it After your
iirst month you will know how much you ll
like your phone, electric and food bills to
run, and you can act accordingly

of a sterile dorm room,” German House
resident George David Dixon pointed out,
“and you‘re more removed than you are in
the dorms." Brinkmann believes German
House is “less hectic" than the dorms, and
she likes the [act that “there is more cons
trol over who you live with and over quiet
Schue Views Russian house as
“our house There’s more of a feeling of
possession.” He added, “dorms are like a
hotel; you have your room, but you know it
belongs to the college."

What to [mow about
living oﬂ-campus

 

1) Start apartment hunting early in the semester. Some apartments

have a waiting list by February, so don’t wait until May to find a place.

2) Call landlords and realtors about apartments. There are lots of nice

apartments that aren’t located on Broad or High Street.

3) If you are very responsible, consider living in a professor’s house

while they are on sabbatical or off campus. These are generally very

nice houses, but you must be careful and can not have parties.

4) Look at apartments while this year’s tenants are there. Ask lots of

questions. “Is it warm, does the stove work, are there roaches, is it

noisy, how is the plumbing?” are just a few examples.

5) Don’t necessarily live with your best friend Find roommates with

whom you can live with who have similar ideas about food, money, par

ties, cleanliness, studying and paying bills.

6) Sign a lease and get a copy. Don‘t rely on an oral contract or you

could be sorry

7) If you sublet your apartment over the summer, make sure that your

tenants put the ut es in their name You ll avoid hassels in August

and keep your credit rating intact

8) Try to pay your bills, including your rent, on time. These can affect

your credit rating in the “real world.”

9) Consider alternatives to McNally 5. Check out co- op buying in the

beginning of each semester, bulk- buying at Hy Vee, and sales at the

other grocery stores in towii'. Read' the Penny "Saver religiously , .
