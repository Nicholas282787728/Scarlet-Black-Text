Swimmers hold their own
against the heavyweights

by Gordon Shreiber

The Grinnell women’s swim
team returned early from their
winter trip to Arizona for two
meets over this past weekend.
On Friday, they swam a dual
meet against Creighton, edging
the visitors 49-46. The women
placed third in Saturday's
Grinnell Invitational behind
Northeast Missouri State and
Creighton.

Head coach Sheila Cain was
very pleased with the weekend
effort, pointing out that
Northeast Missouri is a Division
II school while Creighton is
Division I.

In the Grinnell Invitational,
the women swam some events
for the first time this year,
including a few 2003 as well as
the 1000 freestyle. Cain felt that
swimming these events was a
"good learning experience” be-
cause it gave her a chance to see
her distance swimmers and
allowed the swimmers to gain
invaluable experience in the
events for the conference meet.

Cain also stressed that the
learn was “swimming tir " after

the coach was pleased with the
effort that the women put into

their work once the taper for

noted great improvements from
the divers during their stay.

meet with Div I Creighton

by Laura Whitmore

Welcome back to glamorous
Grinnell; 1 hope your break was
restful. While the rest of us were
enjoying the warmth and
companionship of our families,
Grinnell’s men‘s swim team
proved that no sacrifice is too
great if you love a spon, when
they left their homes to practice
in Florida. Don’t be jealous,
though; their trip was hardly a
day at the beach—they worked
hard.

That hard work paid off when
they returned to Grinnell (which,
no doubt, they couldn't wait to
do). Last Friday, Grinnell hosted
Creighton University in a close
meet which came down to the
final relay. Creighton won the
relay and thus the meet but oniy

Creighton is Division I and has
12, count ‘em, 12 full
scholarship swimmers.

Every swimmer on the
Grinnell team turned in great
performances. The same held
true the next day when the
Pioneers hosted the Grinnell
Invitational, which they won by
93 points.

This weekend the swim team
will take another trip, this one to
tropical Cedar Rapids to
participate in the Eco
Invitational. Don’t begrudge
them Florida. After all, would
you want to spend a weekend at
Coe?

No vacation for Pioneers
as they drop five straight

by Bob Lifton

Winter break didn't prove to
be much of a holiday for our
~men‘s basketball team. The
Pioneers came up empty in all
five of their games, dropping
their record to 279. To make
matters worse, Grinnell suffered
unaffordable injuries to three key
players: guard/captain Mike
Spurbcek (back); forward George
Mclimscy (ankle): and guard
Steve Howland (foot). If there’s
a bright spot in this miserable
scenario, it‘s that the Pioneers
will play eight of their next 11
games in the friendly conﬁnes of
Darby Gymnasium, There‘s
certainly no better time for hotne-
court advantage.

The crop of January defeaLs
came at the hands of Mt. St.
Clare, Coc, Cornell, Ripon, and
Beloit. The Pioneers didn’t
exactly snatch defeat from the
hands of victory. either. In fact.
they were blown out by 20 or
more poian in four of the ﬁve
contests.

Coach Jeff Westlund points
to three inﬂuential factors which
he believes played a prominent
role in his team‘s losing streak.
On the one hand, there‘s youth.
After scouring the Pioneer roster.
you discover only one senior.
During a stretch of the above-
mentioned debaeles, Westlund
posted three freshmen, a
sophomore, and a junior on the
court. These younger players are
naturally plagued by
inexperience; all learning comes
only through time.
Unfortunately, this road to a
better understanding is full of
immense potholes which come in
the form of defeats.

Another important factor
which the coach alluded to was
the damagkboth physically and
mentallyithat winter break
imposed on his squad. “The
break killed us," said Westlund.
“ Coming back after a couple of
weeks, the players were not in

good enough condition to play a
full game of basketball. It took
time for us to develop our timing
back.“ And by that time,
probably somewhere in the third
or fourth quarter. the ball game
was already long over.

The final piece to the puzzle
of Pioneer losses (a coach’s worst
nightmare, pondering the reason
for a lack of success) is
undoubtedly the flock of injuries.
Injuries are always costly, but in
certain circumstances they are
more inopporlune than others. A
young team such as Grinnell
simply cannot afford to lose a
player, not to mention three. It
is hoped that they will heal in
time for their upcoming home
stand As last heard, they (all
three) were day by day.

tip off against Lawrence (3~2).
Tomorrow the Pioneers host St.
Norbert (3-3) at 1:30 pm. While
they‘re not at full strength as a
team, playing in front of their
home fans may ignite the spark
Grinnell has been missing

It's only a matter of time
before the Pioneers break out of
this mini-slump, and what better
time than in their own gym?
According to Westlund. "We're
going to improve, there’s no
question of that We’ll get there.
If we play hard, play together,
and keep our heads in the game,
we will deﬁnitely improver" You
can bet on that.
