Anthropology department grows 311%

but denied new full- time member
Resentment builds in classic study of college politics

by Steven w. Way and Eric Weiss

'i‘llr anthropology department, in
dependent trom sociology only since 1977.
is growuig at a profoundly rapid rate. in
the last decade anthropology experienced
a 311 percent jump in its number of majors
— a ﬁgure that makes it the fastest
growing department in the college, wcll
tihead of economics ﬁll 156 percent.

To insure the department‘s continued
effectiveness and to halt a steady stream
of one semester appointments. the
department, already at the “saturation
point," according to ti State of the
Department report, proposed in June that
it be granted :1 new fullrtime faculty
member to begin work the spring semster
of 1982 This person would offset the loss of
Jon Andelson to leave second semester,
Douglas Calulkins' dual responsibilities as
director of Uivaampus Study and Ralph
Lucbloon's retirement in 1935 The fourth
member of the department is Chairman
Ronald Kurtz

That is not going to happen, and it is
doubtful whether even by next fall a new
facility member will have joined the
department, An action by the Board oi
Trustees limiting the number of [acuity
members to ma makes it impossible for
one person to join until another has left a
or until an administrative decision has
been made to increase one department's

faculty at the expense oi another‘s.

The anthoropology case is a classic
study oi college politics The department's
iaculty, citing their department's growth
while anthropology as a major field
nationwide is stagnant, say they deserve a
new person. The administration says it has
to put anthropology's request in the con-
text of the needs of the entire college: and
resentment grows on each side.

“Yes, anthropology has had heavy loads
but they have had a steady stream oi part
time help. so they haven‘t been ignored 7
they haven't been sittlng out there without
any attention," Dcan oi Faculty Catherine
Frazer said.

”We would all rather have continuity
iinstead of part time instructorst but some
of the factors necessitating the one term
appointments were perpetuated by in-
dividual decisions on the part of the
faculty." Frazer said. "i in general terms)
We don't anticipate one professor getting a
fellowship and deciding to take a leave or
another deciding to go to Grinnell in
London."

Kurtz said the department wants to be
phasing in someone while Luebben. who
will retire in four years, is being phased
out, and he maintains that past depart-
mcntal deﬁciencies in terms of faculty on

leave can be blamed on the element of
iinpredictahlility

“We were not always able to predict
when things would be short," Kurtz said.
“Somebody got a grant, somebody took a
semester off to do research and we were
leit having to hire a partrtlme person We
would not want to be in the same boat
again ”

Luebben. however, said that if the
current majors trend holds, the student
faculty ratio could rise to as mtlch as t-4o
next semester, making anthropology's
ratio the highest In the school and well
above the college’s overall lri2 ratio,

“The department is dragging its ass,"
Luebben said. Next semster. only he and
Kurtz Will be counseling students, as the
temporary lecturer, a doctoral student at
town State University, “doesn't know the
ropes at Grinnell."

Luebben said it was “unrealistic" for
him to be expected to advise and work out
schedules for 40 students within a twee
week period. He said it was a shame that
Grinnell's anthropology department, ”the
best in the Associated Colleges of the
Midwest," has to hire lecturers that are
sometimes inexperienced.

The currenL overworked conditions.
Luebben said, result from the resolution

limiting the number of [acuity members to
105. “This is a poor policy,” he said,
“There is a limit you can go to before you
lose your marbles."

Frazer said her office has received
position requests that go back several
years and that it is not the quantity of the
faculty that the administration and
trustees are concerned with improving but
rather its quality.

"A department that thinks its growth
merits staffing has to make its case r the
mere asking isn't sufficient reason for
responding," Frazer said, “We always put
individual department requests in the
context of the needs of the college as a
whole and then work to make conclusions
and recommendations "

The department request for a new
member that was presented to Frazer‘s
office in June specifically calls for “a
general anthropologist with qualifications
which would qualify her to replace Ralph
(Lucbbenl when he retires ”

Kurtz said the department specifically
called for hiring a woman because “Ihere
are a lot oi very qualified women in an
thropology. It would only be right to have
the high proportion of female an-
thropologists at least partially represented
in the department,"

Health Center to add RN after break

Griswold cites student caselOad, administrative duties

by Anne Rawland -

Sometime after fall break a new face
will greet Students at Grinnell's Health
Center. But for the first. time in five years
the newcomer will be an addition rather
than a replacement

“with the student caseload i am notable
’to meet my goals or the requirements set
down' in my job description " said Health
Center Supervisor Andrea Griswold when
asked about the added staff member. “Sol
asked the administration if we could have
another part-time RN."

Griswold began initial screening of
applicants last week. She noted that
although four people applied, only one
applicant was “fully qualified.” At press
time the review process was incomplete
and Griswold was still accepting ap
plications. Qualified applicants must in-
terveiw separately with Griswold, stall

The reorganization means Griswold will

Griswold Cited several reasons for the

First, she must serve as a liason between

Five attend 1M. forum

Dombrowski proposes studeiit'council

by Beth Vilen

Five students attended a forum held by
Edward Dombrowski, director of the in
tramural program, Wednesday night in
Science 171. According to Dombrowski, the
meeting was held to propose the formation
of an intramural Council which would run
the I.M. program and to get student
response to that proposal, Dombrowski
said that he would like to see a council of
students running the I.M. program
because “they're the ones who are playing
in it." Dombrowski's role as director of the
program would be merely to serve as a
guide to the council,

Several suggestions pertaining to the
council were made at the forum. Dom»
browski suggested that the council would
meet before each sesason to designate
which activities would be played, how
many teams would play, what the rules
would be and so forth. This suggestion met
general approval. One student suggested
that l.M. "coordinators for each dorm
should be responsible tor attending a few

meetingsa year at which new ideas for the
program could be gathered. A smaller
council could then take those ideas and
organize schedules, rules, and other
details. it was further suggested that a
survey of all students be taken to deter
mine what activities would be most
popular.

Those in attendace at the forum finally
decided that an organizational meeting of
I.M coordinators and all interested
students should be held in December to set
up an I.M. council. Dombrowski agreed to
organize the meeting. The council will then
meet in the spring to plan next fall's I.M.
program.

Some general complaints were voiced at
the meeting about the incompetence oi
some referrees and the overly competetive
attitude of some players. The apathy oi
those involved was also commented on and
manifested by the absence of all but one

_I.MV coordinatorand all the l.M. referees

education in both general and preventative
health. As a first step she distributed a
needs assessment survey to all students.
Although she received only 200 responses,
Griswold said students often commented,
“Why can't you give us more information
on what we can do for ourselves?"

A third reason Griswold mentioned
stems from the logistics of the present
staffing situation. “If either nurse is ill or
absent then the other must put in 12-hour
days,” she .said. Bailey concurred with
Griswold's assessment. “Attendance at
the Health Center appears to be up,” she
said. “We even have more people staying
overnight.”

“She (Griswold) has made an attempt to
make more outside Contact. I mink she’s
also trying to broaden the scope of the
Health Center," noted Bailey. “She also
seems to have more administrative

duties.”

Tederman agreed, “We found that there
were a lot of things out there which just
couldn't be done with only two nurses. " He
also referred to Griswold’s job description.
saying the college wants her to increase
“educational programs and community
and state contacts."

Last year the college ﬂirted brieﬂy with
closing the Health Center and moving its
services to Grinnell General Hospital but
reconsidered in the face of high costs and
student dissatisfaction, Tederman
believes now that the college has decided
to keep the Health Center on campus, it
should be upgraded as much as possible.

Thus, he said when he made the
proposal, the college was very willin to
come up with the money to pay tor a tEird
hand. Stressed Tederman, ”ltdidn't have
to battle for this.”

Academic calendar revised
But single buffer day still set for this semester

by Adam Buick

The final exam schedule for this year,
Wednesday, Dec. 16 through Sunday, Dec.
20, has two unusual characteristics. First,
there is only one buffer day. Secondly,
exams will be held on Sunday afternoon.

The reason for these two problems can
be traced to the idiosyncratic calendar, the
Gregorian calendar Every year has 365
days which are broken down into 52 Weeks
and one day. The one odd day left over is
what causes the problem For example,
this year first semester began on Monday,
Aug. 31. However, next year Aug. 31 is
Tuesday, so to keep the beginning of first
semester on a Monday, the date is set back
to Monday, Aug, 30. This is repeated for six
years. After six years the beginning is
again set forward to Aug. 31 and the
process repeats itself. '

This process causes complications when

it. comes to the final exam schedule for
first semester, When the date is set for-
ward to Aug. 31, as this year, the end of
ﬁrst semester is pushed very close to
Christmas.

Dean of the Faculty Catherine Frazer
has appointed a sub-committee of the
Academic Standing Committee to design a
new academic calendar which would have
the irregularities of the Gregorian
calendar built into it According to Charles
Jepsen, professor of mathematics and
member of the sub-committee, this new
calendar would be a long-term calendar,
so students and faculty would know further
in advance the next years' schedule. The
new calendar is now being finalized and
will be submitted for ratification by
Thursday, Oct. 15 t
