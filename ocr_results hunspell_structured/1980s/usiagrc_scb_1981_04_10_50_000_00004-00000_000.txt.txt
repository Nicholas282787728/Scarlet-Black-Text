ment.

A debate centered on the issue of
whether or not Joint Board should be
responsible to tinance sports on the

tramurals have been financed by JB in
the past, many membersofJB feel they
should be the responsibility of the

been a mutually beneficial one.” Grins
nell is a major employer Within the
community, and Warren Reinecke,

The campaign is conducted by per
sonal telephone solicitation as a
separate phase oi the telethon iund-
raising done by students, As many as
106 volunteers solicit faculty and ad-
ministrative personnel of the college as
well as town citizens. Volunteers are
organized into teams led by captains
and division leaders. The Weeks'
oversee the recruitment of Volunteers
and the operation oi the campaign

This program is an important source
of income [or the college and last year‘s
campaign raised over $60,000. Reinecke
is Optimistic that this year's total will
surpass the 1979 record 01561000, This
money is placed in the Annual Fund
where it helped to make up the deficit
between tuition and the total cost of
educating each student. Assuming that
a Student receives no linanclal aid, he
still only pays 62 percent oi his educa-
tion. as the rest is covered by the en-
dowment and the annual fund.

Beginning with the 1931 solicitation,
special recognition will be accorded
donors of $135 or more, These donors
will be named J.B, Grinnell Assocmtes
in honor at the town's founder and in
recognition of dollar support equal to
the number of years since the college's
lounding, which is 135.
