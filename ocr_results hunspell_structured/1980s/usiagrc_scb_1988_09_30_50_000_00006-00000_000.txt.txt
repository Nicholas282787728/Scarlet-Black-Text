Members of women's group
respond to Fields' cartoon

To the Editor:

This is regarding the cartoon
printed about the forum on ha-
rassment in the Sept. 23 issue of
the Scarlet and Black. The
cartoon pictures the panel at the
forum with "Evil Dean Vader",
"Cop l", and "Cop 2" depicted as
targets being shot at by a bunch
of bitchy women known as the
"Grinnell College Women‘s
Group" who, of course, have
nothing better to do but whine
about being harassed. We are of
the opinion that in order for this
to have been printed there must
be a great misunderstanding about
our attempt to fight harassment.

Sexual harassment is not an
issue that effects only college
students. It also affects people
that live in the town. Those of
us that are involved with this is-
sue do not hate men, but we hate
the fact that We feel vulnerable
every time we step outside of our
doors. Our purpose is not to
cause a male/female schism on
this campus, but to have men re-
alize that for rape and harassment
to end, men must stop raping and
harassing (we do acknowledge the
fact that there are other types of

rape). If the cartoonist feels that
harassment on this campus is a
trivial subject, there must be
others who hold this rather dis-
torted viewpoint If these people
were not at the open forum, they
needed to be there; if they were

there, they did not LISTEN to
what we were saying. Hopefully,
this will be our third and final
attempt to clarify his issue.

Kent's column

"He has pissed me off..."

To the editor:

I would like to start out by
congratulating Mike Kent. He
has pissed me off, which is the
stated purpose of his column.
However, he has also publicly
espoused an idea which is not
only fundamentally flawed, but is
actually dangerous to tile cause of
equal rights for minorities. The
idea that white males are
discriminated against in our soci-
ety is totally ridiculous.

I am a white male myself,
but I never fail to feel sick every
time I hear a person say this. I
know of very few colleges, and
Grinnell is certainly not one of
them, where the percentage of
minority students even ap
proaches the percentage of mi-
norities in the U. S. population
as a whole. The same situation
prevails among minorities in po-
litical offices, or in executive

positions in the private sector. It
is impossible to think that this
pathetic ratio results from a prejr
udice against white males. The
fact is that minorities face a his
lorical disadvantage in America,
which is a perfectly justifiable
reason for affirmative action.

As members of this society
we have each inherited a subsmnr
tial complex of prejudices. One
need only look at the Samantha
Fox posters hanging in various
dorm rooms for proof that
women are still looked upon as
objects, even today. White males
are certainly not the victims.
When was the last time any of us
had to consider the problems our
sex or color would create for us?
What we are, all of us myself in
cluded, is part of the problem.
Think about that. C or e y
Hardin

"To be pro-woman is not to be
anti-man"

To the editor:

In response to Mike Kent’s
article, "The White Male Advanv
rage," most people would agree
that stereotypes are wrong and
harmful in any context. How-
ever, it is not the job of the
"legitimate" women‘s group to
say that they aren‘t "male-bash-
ers." It ls Mr Kent's job to rcr
frain from labeling feminists as
such. To be provwoman is not to
be antirman.

If the world were an ideal
place, there would be no need for
scholarships for women and mi-

norities. The fact remains that, ii
the present trend continues, when
Mr. Kent graduates from Grin-
ncll in 1992, he will definitely
have an advantage in the job
market. Despite changes in re-
cent years, American institilions
continue to cater to white males.
No one should suggest that Mr.
Kent is "personally responsible
for the oppression of every other
racial, ethnic, and sexual group in
the world," but evcryonc should
ask, what is he doing to stop it?

"Defending Mike Kent certainly is

'Against the Grain

To the Editor:

In one short column, Mike
Kent has managed to offend al-
most everyone I know, with the
possible cxception of white
males. A remarkable accomr
plishment for a freshling only on
his third column.

Kent claims that he is merely
trying to present another point of
View, to make people think about
both sides of the "issue-of-the-
week." If Kent's only goal is to
have his column discussed, then
he is succeeding. However, the
many conversations I have heard
about his column revolve around
negative comments about Kent

lie can chip
And he can putt »
lle's our man,

himself, rather than the issucrre-
lated discussion Kent claims to
want.

Perhaps this says something
about students on this campus.
However, even if Grinnclllans are
as narrow-minded and shallow as
Kent seems to imply, it is still
possible to present an altemalive
veiwpoint without personally ofr
fending everyone on campus.

Maybe Kent’s next column
should be in defense of himself;
supporting Mike Kcnt certainly
is "Against the Grain." Eliza-
