Forum Gallery Vandalized

by John llarrisoii

Last week. the Negative Space Gallery
in the Forum was struck by vandals who
disfigured and destroyed a number of wire
sculptures that were part of junior Sara
Croft’s exhibition entitled ”Whyare Pear

let,

p Although the perpetrators of the van-
dalism have not been found, homophobia is
believed to be a possible motive for the
vandalism.

The exhibit went up on Saturday,
February ath, and by Tuesday. February
llth. vandals had bent many figures out of
shape and completely destroyed as many
as tour of the wire sculptures.

The exhibition was a multi-media
presentation which displayed human
figures sculpted out of wire hangers and
newspaper clippings of current events.

The newspaper clippings were of such
current issues as the farm Crisis, famine.
and in particular, the crisis of the AIDS
epidemic.

Artist Sara Croft said that someone
smashed many of the figures into a single
pile of wire and some figures were bent in-
to sexually explicit positions,

Croft said that along with the damaged
figures. the newspaper articles referring
to the AIDS epidemic were taken from

their original position and placed across a
number of the smashed figures

Because oi the positions of the vandallzr
ed figures and the placement oi the AIDS
articles. many have been led to believe
that homophobia was behind the vandals
actions.

Croft said that it appeared as though the

vandalism was done by individuals who
were making a statement against
homosexuals. Croit said “this vandalism
was probably done by homophobic Inr
diViduals.”
:Yet Jenny Erickson, Forum manager,
said that it looked as though the wire
tigures were “not vandalized as much as
they were rearranged." Erickson said, . It
did not look like vandalism but...
something else."

Erickson expressed her dismay that
Grinnell students would be so thoughtless
as to deface another student‘s artwork, yet
she pointed out that in her ten years at the
Forum, she has never had problems with
vandalism in the Negative Space Gallery.

As for the accusation that homophobia
was behind the vandalism. Erickson said
that she was unsure of the vandal’s
motivation but she stressed her hope that
Grinnellians would be able to respect each
others’s differences.

HurWitz resigns:
Faculty Retention Questions Arise

by Jill Ellis

Jonathan Hurwitz, Assistant Professor
of‘Political Science, has resigned his job at
Grinnell and will be moving onto a new job
at the University of Pittsburgh at the end
of this semester.

Hurwitz, who has been teaching at Grin-
nell since 1982, expressed his sorrow at
leaving. explaining to the s is B “It's been
a good four years. I‘ll miss the people
here." but adding “there are just other
things 1 want to do.”

Hurwitz specifically is interested in
spending more time conducting research
in his field of American politics and voter
behavior.

Hurwitz's resignation, as part of a trend
of professor resignations in recent years.
raises some question as to Grinnell’s abili~
ty to retain its highcaliber professors.

At a small college such as Grinnell, a
professor's primary duty is teaching. At a
large university. on the other hand, em.
phasis is placed more heavily on research.

Dean Catherine Frazer pointed out that
although some might view the emphasis on
teaching as a limitation upon the pro
fcssors' abilities and opportunities for
research. the emphasis on teaching does
indeed serve a good purpose.

While the Grinnell faculty may not in
clude any Nobel prize-winning scientists in
its ranks. Frazer noted. it does include one
professor e Luther Erickson a who was
distinguished as the best chemistry
teacher in Iowa a few years ago.

Frazer also pointed out that it is the
teachers who make Grinnell the
academically rigorous and thus the highly
respected school that it is. Research.

although certainly a necessary part of .

graduaterlevel study, is out of place at a
small undergraduate school such as Grin-
nell.

Proiessors at Grinnell can. of course. do
limited research while on sabbatical, but
the amount of time they can devote to their
research is then limited to one semester

every several years. leeralizing the sali-
batical policy might give professors, such
as l-lurwitz, the time and support to con
duct the research they want, thus inducing
them to remain at Grinnell. but such a plan
would be both expensive and of little long
term use.

As Frazer explained, though, a more
liberal sabbatical policy might lure a few
research-oriented professors to remain at
Grinnell. But this lure would probably re
main effective for only a few years, and
thus would be of ”marginal help.”

Frazer added that she would be surpris»
ed if Hurwitz had wanted to stay at Grin-
nell longer, noting that his predecessor,
too. remained at Grinnell only a few years
before moving on to a large. research-
oriented university. Hurtwitz‘s field of
specialization requires constant research
and a large, readily available data base
from which to work,

Obviously, one cannot readily find a
large data base in the middle of the Iowa
corniields.

In addition to this restriction, professors
at Grinnell face the problem of living in a
small town in Iowa. While Grinnell’s
smalltown atmosphere may be the ideal
setting for raising a family. it is hardly the
place for young, single academics to enjoy
an active social life. single protessors
drawn to Gi‘innell by its academic reputa-
tion are often repulsed by the town‘s small
Size.

Along similar lines. the spouses of mar-
ried professors are often at a loss to find
ineani Iul employment in Grinnell.
unless they too. are academics employed
by the college.

Charlie Duke. Professor of Physics and
faculty chairman expressed his belief that
Grillllcll professors are forced to make
choices between committing time to
teaching and time ior research Duke cm-
phasized that unlike other schools, pru-
tcssors are iorced to takc on many responr
sibilitles of running the college He stress-

Space exhibit. Photo by Stephen

In the words or the artist. the exhibition
attempted to express the importance of in
dividuals to be aware oi their surroundings

ed that. “some semesters you may decide
to serve on a committee or you may choose
to finish a paper you’re working on... it all
comes down to a matter of choice." .

Dean Frazer is reluctant to acknowledge
any significant problem at all with iaculty
retention at Grinnell, explaining that for
every professor Grinnell loses, there is so
meone willing to take the open position:
“It‘s purely a matter of the individual's
choice."

According to Frazer. Grinnell has no
problem finding new professors to hire.
Out of four job offers recently sent out, two
candidates have accepted Grinnell's offer,
one rejected. and one candidate has yet to
reply. ”That’s not a bad batting average,"
she said.

However, the college administration
does apparently recognize the need (or
greater incentives to keep professors at
Grinnell. President George Drake, when
asked the reasons behind the $950 raise in
tuition for next year, gave the need for in-
creases in professors salaries as a maior
factor, continued on p. 3

and conscious oi themselves in relation
to the rest of the world Croft said. “I was
attempting to get people to think beyond

_themselves and into themselves,"

Croft said an important theme of the ex-
hibition was that participation and active
thought are missing in modern society and
that it is critical that we as‘ thinking and
creative people become involved in over-
coming problems whichaillict all human
beings.

Croft expressed her dismay with the
vandalism by saying, “It is ironic that this
show was vandalized for it asked people to
think creatively. and not to act destruo
lively."

Croft believed that the vandalism was a
manifestation oi the alienation of people
and a deep-seated fear of homosexuals.

Homophobia is a subject of much con
cern for gay Grinnellians.

Explicitly violent messages written in
washrooms throughout campus are often
printed as a manifestation of the
homophobia that exists at Grinnell.

Rich Beck, a gay Grinnell student said.
“there are a lot of closet homophobic: who
express themselves in anonymous and
malicious ways,"

Beck expressed his belief that wide-
spread homophobia olten creates pro-
blems for people who are struggling to be
openly gay.

Beck believes that homophobia also
causes homosexuals to be more separatist
in there social interactions.

Beck also emphasized that the outbreak
of the AIDS epidemic has increased and
justified homophobia for people.

He also stressed that AIDS epidemic has
deterred many men from coming out and
publicly expressing their homosexuality.

Beck said that oiten to be openly gay is
to be seen as a leper since the outbreak of
the AIDS epidemic.

Furthermore, Beth Johnson. a gay Grinr
nell student emphasized that the college
administration is very specific in saying
there shall be absolutely no discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference.

Johnson expressed her disgust over the
gallery vandalism yet stressed her desire
for homophobic people to be open about
ihelr opinions.

Johnson expressed here wish for people
to be open and committed to tpublicly) ex-
press themselves.

Johnson said, “We need to disspell the
myths about homosexuality. I want a
chance to talk to the people who Commit
homophobic vandalism and write
homophobic grafﬁti."

The appearance last Friday oi The Cor.

newspapers published by Black students.
such as The Brotherhood have previously

however, are the goals senior Robert
Quashie has set for tile paper.

The Cornerstone is to be a monthly
newspaper with a distribution oi soil
copies. The paper will not have a regular
staii. but rely on the contributions oi all
Grinnell students. Quashie. founder at this
latest Black newspaper, feels that the

will better serve its purposes
The primary goal ot The Cornerstone is
to provide a sense of community for Black
students. but Quasllle asserts that fulfillr
ing this goal will also mean addressing
issues pertinent to the entire Grinnell com-
