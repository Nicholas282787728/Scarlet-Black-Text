Research is a “Gas”

by Justin Lincoln

Envision, it you will. trying to in
vestigate the anomalies of Soviet culture
while Working in the United States, Not a
particularly inviting prospect, is it?
Physics Department Chairman William
Case is faced with a similar problem in his
study of plasma physic

While the technical def on of plasma
is complex, it can generally be deiined as
matter “in the form of electrified gas With
the atoms disassociated into positive ions
and negative electrons," Some specula-
tions assert that 99 percent of the matter in
the universe exists in this state, which is
very possible. since "all stars are
plasma." as is interstellar hydrogen Our
tiny sector oi the universe seems to be the
remaining l percent, however. Close to
home. our encounters with plasma are
limited to llashes oi lightning. the aurora
borealis, and the gases in ﬂuorescent tubes
and neon signs

Professor Case came to Grinnell in 1930
with a on D. in particle theory irom
Syracuse University. His extensive studies
or the properties or plasma have lead to
theoretical research concerning the dif-
tereiit manners in which plasma beams
contribute to the generation oi
microwaves.

During summer months. Case works as
a theorist at the microwave generator

The French Conversation Class under
the direction oi Dominique Frin will pre

gram will alter dramatic readings oi the
best of the French poetry oi the nineteenth
century along with music, a line arts slide
show and authentic French pastry. All are
welcome to this petite voyage into the
beaux arts oi France,

in recent years. Case has also developed
an interest in bridges. specifically. “their
structures and related physics " He has
spent considerable time and film
photographing and inspecting bridges and
other structures in North Aelnrica and
Europe for use in a course he's teaching
this semester entitled “Structures " While
on sabbatical next year. Case will spend
six months with Swiss bridge designer
Christian Menn. examining various Struc»

Student/
Trustee
Forum

iiy Mary Jo Ti-cpkii llntl iii‘ lltimuill,

On Friday. May 2nd at 4:30 in South
Lounge, Mortar Board will be sponsoring
an informal discussion with the Trustees.
All students are invited to attend

The purpose oi the lorum is to oiier
students an opportunity to meet the
Trustees and discuss campus issues with
them, Thc iorum has been designed to give
students general information about the
Trustees: what they do, how they became
Trustees. how long they serve. and what
they see as longrterm goals for the college
Then students will have the opportunity to
ask the Trustees questions,

Mortar Board hopes that there will be it
wide variety at issues and concerns and
that no one issue will dominate discussion,
Mortar Board members will he
moderating the discussion Finally, there
will also be an opportunity lor the Trustees
to ask the students questions. Everyone is
encouraged to attend and give their input
into policymaking at Grinnell.

A Study in Energy

hy Mnyiee (‘lmi

Opportunities ior students to learn more
about the ”science of motion" abound in
the Physics Department. Professor
Charles Duke‘s actIVitIes are a testament
to that fact i

For the past iaza years. Duke has work-
cd with a nuclear physics group irom Iowa
State University, The group ol three pro-
tessors and several graduate students go
to Brookhaven National Institute in Long
island during the summer and bring
nuclear material back here to Iowa [or
analysis,

“In the past 1 have had students liorking
with me during the summer, but not (or the
past two to three years." Duke said.

"What “6 study is very shortrllved
ii uclel created in the reactor at
lirookhaven When they decay they emit
gamma rays. We study the energy of the
ravs. ' he said,

he results are recorded on magnetic
tape and the tape is brought back here and
to Ames

Duke said. "That's just the raw data We
have to distract the gamma radiation
energy and put together a spectrum. The
goal is to make energy level. or decay,
spectrums,"

He explained that when electrons [all
from their orbits outside the nucleus of an
atom. light is emitted.

--The same thing happens in the nucleus
except the physical light is replaced by
high energy gamma rays Our problem is
to measure that lenergyl." he said,

brand new course currently in the works

, AND THE HISTORY OF PHYSICS.

Since coming to Grinnell in 1963.
Clotlelter has developed additional in-
terests concerning physics and history.
though with the roles reversed. With
research supplemented by studies and
teaching in London on the Grinnell pro
gram, he has written recent papers that
deal with the history at science. and also
teaches a course of that name.

Clotielter's examination of this area ins
volves prominent scientists and the
development oi ideas in biology.
chemistry, and physics irom Copernican
theories in 1543 to 1900, For example, his
study traces physics troin its iniancy and
evolution as a science in the 16005,
through the 18th century obsession with
Combustion. to the 19th century studies of
heat, energy, and electromagnetic theory.

"This summer Ira strauber [Associate
Professor of Political Scienceland I will be
developing a course called Technology
and Politics: Mass Communications,’
That's a pretty substantial redirection ior
both of ils " .

This course. to be oitered next spring. is
part of the Sloan Foundation Program for
technology and problem-solving studies.
Although the content has not yet been
chosen. he hopes to explore some case
studies

"For example. we may take the
telephone industry and Start With Alexs
ander Graham Bell and push it to the pre
sent and in the process look into the
deregulation. the economics. We've real
ly had an Electronics Revolution as tar as
communications is concerned. It has had a
pretty prolound effect on how we think and
how we do things in politics, economics.
etc "

In addition, Duke has worked on the
development oi lab computers. Last year
the department received a grant irom the
INTEL Corporation tor lab computing
work

”lComputing has] been a major push in
the department." he said 'ou just can‘t
buy standard systems that do‘ what you
want."

Students have also been involved with
this. Mark Schmitz l'86l recently Iinlshed
one such project and Eugenia Corrales
«57> is working on an independent project
that is making use of the computer
systems, Students interested in developing
lab computer systems should contact Pro~
lessor Duke.

parts oi the electromagnetic spectrum.
According to Cadmus. the two universities
are measuring the stars in the ultraviolet
range While on the same night, Grinnell
measures the stars in the visibile range,

Despite the once-inrarliletime ap-
pearance of Halley‘s comet. Cadmus said
that no studies at the comet are being con»
ducted simply because it “is not favorably
placed in the northern hemisphere” for
such observation. and that attempted
studies would only produce results inferior
in quality to those oi southern
astronomers,
