IFC/PASF offer funding

by Aileen Chang

Small campus groups needing money
to support their proiects might tind aid
by applying to the Political ActiVities
Support Fund or the initiative Fund
Commitee, two channels by which the
SGA distributes funds.

Tlus year Mark Salmanson is Chair-
ing the initiative Fund Committee and
Eric Secoy is the chairman of PASF.
PASF funds are used [or political Ber
tivities and IFC usually supports
various nonrpolitical projects,

Salmalison would like his committee
to ‘help more small and different
groups. "It doesn't have to be an all
campus project," he said “A group
that's new, unique, that maybe can't
get iunds from a department, is the
kind I'd especially like to help,” he ex
plained. “For example, maybe so»
n'ieone wants to start a ping pong club
and needs money to buy ping pong
balls "

-IFC does prefer, however, to support
groups with 20 or more members. said
Salmanson. Groups and events that
have been hacked by the initiative fund
include the German House’s
otrtobericst, the SmithrLangan party,
and the Society [or Creative
Anachromsm,

'Salmanson also pointed out that peer

pie should apply lor tunds before an »

event takes place IFC limits its sup
port or any group to $200, but Salmanr
son stressed that his Committee not on-
ly allocates money but also helps
groups plan projects and develop ideas.

PASF assigns Iunds to groups and in-
dividuals to sponsor speakers, lectures,
and publications on campus which pro~
vide intormation on political matters.
MOBE and the Women's Group are
among the organizations that benetit
from PASF funds.

Irena Cleland is an example of an in»
dividual who received PASF support
tor a proiect she thought would inlorm
students about an important political
issue. She obtained funds last year [or
her rather, a representative ot a group
called NOMOR, which is opposed to the
LEe or nuclear energy, to speak on cam~
pus.

PASF tends to tavor groups that have
specitic, well thought-out proposals tor
projects that will benetit and interest a
good number or people, said Secoy.
Groups ot any size may‘apply tor tunds,
however, FASF'S maleum allotment
is $100,

The procedures tor obtaining tunds
from PASF and the Initiative Fund are
similar. Applications are available
from the chairmen of each Committee
and from the SGA office.

Each Committee discusses an ap,
pllcation for money with an individual
