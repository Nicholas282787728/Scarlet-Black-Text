The meaning of mefen

by May-lee Chai

Here in China, I have been
brushing my teeth with tooth-
paste made from powdered pearls.
Not bad for a lowly college stu-
dent from Iowa. But in order to
buy it, I had to struggle with
three clerks at the department
store, miming and pointing and
begging until one deigncd to un-
derstand me and sell me snme
toothpaste.

Ah, China, land of culture
and beauty, land of mefeu.
What's mefen? Literally, "me"
is the sensation you get if you
hit your funny bone or if you
stick a wet ﬁnger into an clecuir
cal socketand "fen" is "trouble.“

In practice, mefcn can de-
scribe almost any troublcsome
and annoying experience.

For example, unlike the
U.S., China has a wonderful
railway system. It can take you
almost anywhere, it‘s cheap, and
is usually on time. However,
just try to buy a ticket,.

Wednesday I went to buy a
ticket for Friday evening to go to
the neighboring city of Suzhou.
I came to the ticket ofﬁce a little
more than a half hour before it
opened to begin standing in line
so I could get a place near the
front.

As soon as the ticket win-
dow opened. the people in line
behind me began to push and
shove. People began to appear
mysteriously near the front of the
line, obstensibly to look more
closely at the blank wall and
ticket window.

The men directly behind me
began to stretch and move back
and forth -- to "see" the window
better, of course. I stuck out my
right arm to block him. A
woman to the left crept into
View. I stuck out my left arm.
Before too long, I was undulating
back and forth like a right guard
with the LA. Lakers,

An hour and ﬁfteen min—
utes later I made it to the window
to buy a ticket. I noticed a sign
saying there was no Friday
evening train so I decided to take
the Saturday morning one.

"Tomorrow." The woman
behind the window said.

"But.

"Tomorrow. Come back
tomorrow." And she tumed her
attention to the next customer,
for, of course, one cannot buy a
train ticket more than two days in

advance.

This is mefen.

I went to the post ofﬁce
and bought some greeting cards
there. The man at the counter
handed me the cards.

"Do you have envelopes?" I
asked.

"No envelopes." he said.

I pointed to a stack of en»
velopcs on a shelf behind him.
"What about those?"

"Oh, I don't know. This
isn't my job. Wait." He turned
and shouted to a woman behind
the stamp counter. "How much
for envelopes?"

Shc shrugged.

He turned back to me. "I
don‘t know, just wait." He ex-
plained that the person whose job
this was had taken a break and
would return sometime in the fur
rare.

I left, promising over my
shoulder, "I'll be back." He nod—
ded and returned to reading his
magazine.

Mel'en.

Finally, a friend and I went
to the "Friendly store" -- a shop
for overseas visitors that sells
American shampoo and cold soda
pop as well as fancy clothes and
art objects.

My friend and I went in
search of a sales clerk. We
walked through a maze of coun-

,ters displaying dusty silks and
jumbled ware. past scrolls of cat-
ligraphy and pictures of ncon-
colored kittens.

In a back room we found
the sales people. One group was
sitting on piles of Oriental car»
pets as they knitted and talked.
Another group was throwing
down Cards with wild abandon in
a heated game of Mah long.

They did not look up when
we entered. And when my friend
ﬁnally found someone willing to
sell some goods. the sales clerk's
eyes said it all:

We were giving them
mel’elt.

Oh, well. There's no use

expecting paradise on earth.

Still, any place where I can
brush my teeth with powdered
pearls in the morning, then in the
afternoon stroll down a 600 year
old boulevard lined with giant
stone chimera guarding the spirit
of a dead emperor -— well, it's
worth a little mefen now and
then.

Samhain, Pomona and white hares

by John Newmark

Close your eyes and keep
them shut for a few seconds.
What did you see? Darkness,
perhaps? Monday night. Oct. 31,
will perhaps be the darkest night
of the year. For Monday night is
officially All Hallow Even, or
Hallowe'en for short. This tradi-
tional holiday now known for
u’ickrorrtrwting, ghosts and gob-
lins, and occasional pranks, has
its origins in ancient Pagan and
Roman customs.

The ancient Britons celeA
bratcd Samhain, "Summer’s End"
on Nov. 1. On this day, bonﬁres
were built to thank their god Baal
for the harvest. The sacred ﬁre
on the altar was put out before
the night of Oct. 31 drew to a
close, and a new one was started
by means of friction. In Ireland,
sacrifices of black sheep were
performed in the newly lighted
fire. The death struggles of these
animals. and the looks of the
creatures, were taken to be omens
for the upcoming year.

The Celts believed that at
this time the sun became a vic-
Lim for six months to the powers
of winter and darkness. Because
of this belief, Samhain ultin
mately was connected with death,

and became the lord of death. On
Oct. 31, he is supposed to gather
those who have died within the
year, and have been conﬁned to
the bodies of lower animals due
to sins they have committed.
Even in the 20th century, some
inhabiIaan of Ireland still call the
315! of October "Oidhche
Shamhna," The Vigil of
Samhain.

Halloween also stems from
an ancient Roman festival at this
time of year held in honor of
Pomona, the goddess of fruit and
gardens. One of the ﬁfteen flam-
ina, priests. was assigned to her.
It was his duty to kindle the fire
for special sacrifices. Pomona
had a garden near Ostia where a
harvest festival was held about
Nov. 1. On this day thanks were
naturally given for her aid to the
harvest. The winter stores of
nuts and apples were opened, and
horses released from work com-
peted in races.

The combination of the
Roman and Druidic traditions
produced many customs, some of
which are still practiced today on
Halloween.

it is customary. for examA
pie, to bob for apples. This

The DePaul Universit

clearly comes from the goddess
Pomona who was the goddess of
fruit. Along with this custom
comes attached many supersti-
tions. A young woman who is
fortunate enough to win an apple
is advised to sleep with it under
her pillow. so that she will dream
of her lover. If she eats this ap-
ple while standing before a mir-
mt, combing her hair. her future
husband will look over her
shoulder into the glass. She
must, no matter what happens,
turn around, or he will vanish.
Most people try to avoid
churchyards and cemetaries on
Halloween. for it is thought that
at this time the spirits of the dead
roam about. According to super-
stition. if you meet such a spirit
face to face, you will die. The
black cat, a supposed companion
of witches. is also something to
avoid during Halloween Such
things connected to Halloween as
we know it today are closely re-
lated to the supernatural traditions
of the Druids.
The white hare, if one fol-
lows pure Halloween tradition.
should be feared more than any
