Jews for Jesus talk
sparks concern

by Jessica Weisel

“I don‘t see Jews for Jesus as
threatening. Students can reject
them," said Steve Fors, one of
the five members of Christians
for Social and Cultural Aware-
ncss. “With any philosophy,
someone is going to be of-
fended.“ CSCA sponsored a prize
sentation Tuesday entitled “Christ
in the Passover,” by Mark Lan-
drum of Jews for Jesus.

Since Passover is one of the
most important Jewish holidays,
some members of the campus
community were concerned that
Jewish students and faculty would
be offendcd by the presentation.
About 25 students attended the
presentation, but very few of
them were Jewish. “Most of the
Jewish students know enough
about this group to know what'
the presentation was going to be
ltke. They’ve had contact, in one
way or another, wtth (Jews for
Jesus),” said Karen Bell, co rli»
nator of Jewish student activttt

During his presentation.
Landlum displayed trad onal
Passover itcnts al“i cxpill ed
them according to standard ,lCWlSit
explanations and according to
Jews for Jesus’ interpretation.

Many of the students in atten-
dance felt that Landrum clearly
explained the differences between
his organization’s and traditional
interpretation, but Ecll questioned
some of Landrum‘s statements.
“I’m not a scholar," Bell said.
“There are a few specific things
that (Landrutn) stated rather posh
tively thatI think are not neces-
sarily universal.” For instance,
during his presentation, Landmtn
discussed mat7ah, the unlcavcncd
bread that is eaten during
Passover, After explaining some
traditional interpretations of
mat/.ah, he said that matzah is
striped and pierced, and compared
these traits to Jesus before the
crucifixion. Bell cited these
statements as examples of ways
that traditional objects are ma-
nipulated during presentations
like Lantlrttm's. She said,
“Matzuhs that come in boxes,
commercial mauuhs, have porior
rations all tltc way through
them." but traditional matzulls
“lire flat, they’re round, there’s no
stripes, and there's no holes,"
She felt that a student who did
not understand traditional
Passover customs might. through

SGA and you couldn't always
find out what was going on un-
less you tracked them down," he
said.

Before the change. the films
and concerts chairs took their sc-
lcctions to Georgia Dentel. direc-
tor of the college’s performing-
arts program, who did all the
booking. According to Killion,
Dentel inﬂuenced the choice of
ﬁlms and concerts. “My impres—
sion was also that she had a great
deal of inﬂuence on what the
campus saw and heard as far as
films and concerts [and] that it
was basically a triumvirate of
Georgia Dentel and the films
chair and the concerts chair who
decided. And we felt that it was
important that students, solely,
be making those decisions," Kilr
lion said,

The Scarlet and Black con»
tacted Dentel two times to allow
her to express her views. Both
time she declined to speak on the

record.
