the Soviet government is very sensitive
about contacts between the Soviet people
and the Western people The Japanese em-
bassy- keeps various pamphlets and
magazines like PICTORIAL JAPAN as a
means to advertise the country Even it a
Russian wants some at them. it is impossi-
ble to visit the embassy Visitors always
have their passports checked by the SOVlet
police. and it it IS found out thata visitor is
a Russian. that visitor is retused permis-
sion to go ahead immediately. Moreover.
he would be investigated thoroughly and
put 'on the black list. All telephones are
tapped and mail is opened

On the other hand toreigners living in the
USSR are also watched all the time They
are contined to certain special buildings
and watched by the police at the entrance
when they leave and come back home. it
they invited a Russian. they would he in
danger. Tapping machines might be iii-
stalled not only Inside the embassy but
also in their private houses.

it is said that all diplomats who have
worked in the USSR betore turn out to be
alllirSoviet. One reason is the hard lite
brought about by the thorough observation
by the Soviet police. as l mentioned. The
second is their antipathy toward the big
gap between what Soviet government ois
tieiols say and what they really think. The
third is that there is no night hie in the
USSR ,

About the northern territory issue. the
statt member pointed out two aspects. One
is that the USSR has a border contlict not
only with Japan but also with China. lithe

l intended to write my impressions about
the people i met throughout this tour as
plainly and obiectively as possible. but I
think the ttegatlve.a§pecls have been ems
phasized However. we must not overlook
the good aspects. For example. there are
no endless advertisements on the Street
and entire towns are very clean No ex-
treme poverty is to be seen, unlike the
USA People are so lawtul that they always

Furthermore. I might have exaggerated
my observations to some extent. For in»

exactly. 1 had to take it uilo consideration
that the population in big cities was much
larger than usual because many people

urrently, the SOVIQI economy is grow

ing endily Moreover. as the USSR is
becoming dependent on the West
economically. the USSR has started to put
emphasis on the tourism business in order
to get more Western currency Western
travellers are increasing year by year. so
the Soviet police is becoming unable to
control all travellers As the Soviet people
are getting more and more opportunities
to meet Westerners. communication at the
level oi the individual Seems to be increas
ing. ln thinking about people suiiering

. under the current Soviet system. i cordial-

ly hope that this economic growth and in-
ci dse in communication with Westerners
would contribute to democratization ol
Soviet society.

Throughout this tour. I vlas forced to
thlttk about various things And at the
same time I realized my Shortage of basic
knowledge. Now I would llke to read more
on the subject, with my own experiences
as a good incentive.
