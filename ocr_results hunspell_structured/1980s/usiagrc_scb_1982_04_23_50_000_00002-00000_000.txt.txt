Ray supports Reagonomics during town meeting
Cautions against blaming Republicans for economic woes

by Steven w. Way

lowa Governor Robert D Ray told a
Griniiell town meeting held in Main
Lounge Wednesday evening that the
Reagan Administration cannot be blamed
for having inherited record inflation, in
terest rates and high unemployment. He
cautioned that irritated voters who see the
current recession as "the Reagan pros
blem” could mistakenly lodge a protest
vote against qualified Republican can-
didates this fall,

Ray. who spoke and responded to ques
tions for 46 minutes in a casual style, said
that the nation is not willing to wait two or
three years for Reaganornics to work. “I
happen to ‘rei-‘ném‘b'er’ what it was like
betore Ron Reagan became president,"
Kay said. “We had high inﬂation, interest
rates soared to the place where construc-
tion stopped, productivity stopped; we had
high unemployment going higher and we
had a grain embargo. I don't think anyone
knows with any certainty that
Reagonomics will work but at the same
time there is some‘ evidence that it will
work."

Ray, whose 14 years as Iowa's chief ex~
ecutive lend him the prestige of having
served longer than any other governor in
United States history, announced earlier
this year that he will not seek a fifth term.

Lee Cloud. assistant professor of music,
has been dented tenure by the Executive
Council. After the council had rejected
Cloud's appeal, it gave its basis for the
deciswn. According to Cloud, the council
told him that his "teaching failed to meet
Grinnell's standard of excellence.”

Cloud, who is in his fourth year at Grins
hell, was confused by the explanation and
asked ju what their “standard of ex-
cellence" is, No definite answer was given.
Cloud expressed an opinion that there is a
veil of secrecy surrounding the council and
that it is most difficult to extract any infors
mation from it.

He stressed that his students are well
prepared when niey complete his courses
and gave proof that they are well prepared
to go on to graduate school it they choose.

Cloud is presently looking for a job but
has no definite plans for the future. It is

During the brief talk that preceeded the
question and answer period, Ray defended
the concept of Reagan's New Federalism
whil expressing reservations about the
mec anism by which it will be financed,
Ray also emphasized that government has
a rightful .role in people's lives and the
Iowa state budget does not have much
more {at that can be Cut.

"We have suffered over the last 20 years
with‘the shift of responsibility [mm the
state to the federal government,” Ray
said. “People have decided that that is not
healthy.” Ray said ﬂat the states are now
in the process of trying to sort out the
responsibilities of the federal and State
governments so that the states do what
they are best able to do and the federal
government limits itself to what it does
best.

“The federal government has encroachs
ed in our lives and everything we do,” Ray
said. “The president has proposed the New
Federalism, I subscribe to that and think
that every governor in the country does."
He added, “However. any New
Federalism program that is made law by
Congress would have to insure that the
ﬁnances are there to pay for the welfare
and food stamp programs that states
would contro .”

possible that he will return next year but
sai , Right now. I am in limbo."

when asked about the tenure process,
Cloud stated that it is vague in terms of re
quirements as well as reasons tor rejec-
tion. He compared the evaluation process
to shadow boxing, since one isn't Sure
when he has hit or missed. However, he did
admit that tenure is useful in some
respects. He said, “It helps the students
because it allows the building of stable pro-
grams around individual strengths; it is
good for the college since it provides at-
traction in particular areas and it is
beneficial to the professors since it pro
vides a sense of security."

Cloud. who teaches music theory, was
not sure what the motivation for the coun~
cil's decision was. He admitted that he had
heard about members of the council
discussing whether his courses were need-

Ray also said that he and his colleagues
believe that poverty is inherently a na»
tional problem and not to be dealt with
solely on a local level. “We governors for
the most part all believe that poverty is a
national problem, not just an lndiVidual
state’s problem, so consequently we think
that there has to be more than just a dump-
ing of that program [Aid to Families with
Dependent Childrenl back to the respec-
tive states,”

in response to a question about his own
ability to survive politically in an era that
tends to chew up its leaders, the governor
said that he had indeed been lucky to last
even two years as a chief executive. He
said that highly oualihed people are
defeated solely by being associated with
unpopular political figures. “Watergate is
a good example. 1 saw some really
outstanding Republican candidates who
went down to defeat because people
wanted to express their anger at the
polls."

Ray is just one of a number of popular
Republican chief executives in the
Midwest who are stepping down this year.
Both Michigan’s Governor William
Milliken and Ohio Governor John Rhodes
are also retiring after their current terms
expire.

doubtful that that could have been a major
factor in the council's decision. if it was,
Cloud said, Ute school cannot be interested

talk about history nor perform.

members, He also brought up the point
that it is economically more feasible for a
college or university to let its present pros
fessors go and bring in faculty members
who don't cost quite so much. Cloud con-
siders this to be a “bludgeoning oi the
teaching profession itself. As a result of
the economic state the American educa~
tional institution is headed in the direction
of cancelling contracts for its own {inane

knowledge the council possessed in music
theory. He was even more puzzled by the
council’s decision since all of the input
from colleagues and students was
favorable.

He termed the decision a ”judgement
call” and stated that the decisi'tﬁi was
somewhat similar to the one made in the
computer services controversy and the
denial of tenure in the Magurshak case.
Cloud asserted the outlook for professorsi
awaiting tenure decisions is questionable
at least and could be uite dim.

He ended with a r etorical question;
,“Just what is the college's definition of
’liheral arts?” He said that if there is a
definition, it is more implicit than explicit
and it should be the other way around. He
emphasized that a clear definition must be
agreed upon and then pursued

Nearly 250 students, faculty discuss policies

Organizer Chasins encourages action: letters, petitions, forums

by Karen Macaulay

“Administrative Authoritarianism at
Grinnell" was the subject of a student
organized open fonim held Monday after
noon in the Forum Grill. Featured were in
structor in Philosophy Susan Isen and
Assistant professor of Philosophy Daniel
Magurshak. Approximately 250 students
and several other faculty members attend-
ed.

Moderator Jim Rabchuk emphasized,
“Our aim is not to discuss the problem that
exists but to define the problem and then
get some action on it.” The discussion in-
cluded an explanation by lsen of the issue
of Magurshak‘s tenure denial last week,
perceptions by students and Magurshak oi
the problem of authoritarianism al Grin-
nell and how to overcome it and» the
organization of students into groups to
carry out specific actions,

iscn began the discussion with an ex-

planation of the tenure and currlculum.

change processes at Grinnell, she said
there is an established procedure before

any curriculum change can occur, involve
ing the process or discussion within the
department and division In the Magur-
shak case. she stated, “The issue is. . . the
administration and the Executive Council
raised the issue of whether we want. , . a
particular approach to philosophy to be
taught at Grinnell College, which we feel is
a violation, not only of general procedures
for tenure and for curriculum change but
more fundamentally, . . of your and my
academic freedom. . that discussion had
never been raised before. . . that high level
of discussion,"

The discussion was then opened to
students and issues considered included
the disregard of policy by the administra-
tion, the changing of admissions policies,
the absence of students on committees. the
South African divestment issue and the
role of the mac '5. A feeling of frustration
With the admiliislration and the need for
unity and action by students was the
general opinion expressed

The improvement of communication
with faculty and administration and ways
to inﬂuence the administration to be con-
cerned about student opinion were also
considered. The suggestions included cons
tacting the trustees, alumni, prospective
students and the press plus better atten-
dance by students on committees.

Magurshak emphasized that students
should talk to faculty. He advised them to
always keep their goals in mind and that
“The re-establishment of rational com,»
munication. , . has to be your aim." He
criticized students for not always taking
advantage of the opportunities for input
they have now, citing bad attendance by
students at the Curriculum Committee
meetings Magurshak admitted that there
have been cases where students have
organized alid presented a rational argu
ment but have been ignored. This occurred
in the case of the South Arman Support
Group, he said, when. “The other parties .
, failed to meet the criteria for ti rational

discussion." 0n the general subject of stu
dent input, he stated, “If we’re going to
take you seriously enough to try to teach
you and by teaching you 1 mean bringing
out and developing your capabilities and
skills to think rationally, to come to some. .
, intellectual and moral autonomous
judgements, then i think we ought to give
you a chance to start doing that."

Harriet Chasins, one of the discussion
organizers, outlined actions students can
take and organized groups of students to
carry out specific tasks. She encouraged
everyone to talk to others about what had
been discussed.

She reminded students that there will be
a forum on Tuesday at 3:30 pm. in South
lounge at which President George Drake,
Dean of Faculty Catherine Frazer, Ex-
ecutive Vice President “ally Walker,
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Tederinan
and Chairman of the Faculty Morris
Parslow will explain what powers they
each have, i
