After iinishing the 1930 season second
overall in the Midwest Conierence and first
in the southern division, this year's men's
soccer team has a pretty high standard to
live up to.

But halfback and cocaptain Reid Wilson
believes that thls season's team should do as
well as last year's, if not better. "All of our
oiiensive team is back lrom last yearexcept
{or one person," Wilson explained "It‘s
strong (the offense) and they should score
lots oi goals."

Forty»two players have turned out (or this
year's team and coach John Fiitsch
describes them as "Small in stature." Yet
Pillsch said that he relt this year's squad
could better last year's record of 6 wins, 4
losses and 2 ties,

“I’d call them a strong team," Pillsch
said, ”or at least a potentially strong team.
On paper the personnel look good; we have
the whole team back except lor two
fullbacks and a goalie." PiiLsCh cited this
tact as one oi me main reasons he expects
his team to have continued success

Piitsch went on to explain that he also ex-
pects this year‘s team to have a better
season because it is in many ways not a new

Pfiisch explained. ”That this
team is working hard is a good sign.‘

Pﬁtsch hadn' t scrimmaged his team
before the 5&3 went to press but he did
highlight some aspects of his probable line-
up:

Greg Donovan would start at goalie and
he also cited fullback David Furth as
“outstanding," At the halfback position
Plitsch said he will start “'I‘wo experienced
players ; " all-coniercnce player Reid Wilson
and senior Joachim Cargas,

As for the front line Pfilsch is sure to have
Junior Abdoulle Sonko as one of the strikers
as well as Doug Rowe "the highest scorer in
