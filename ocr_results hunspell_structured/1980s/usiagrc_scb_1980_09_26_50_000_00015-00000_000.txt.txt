WHITHER SKIP DAY,
or, Spring ahead, Fall back

Skip Day! Those are the words which
once raised the hearts and minds oi
Grinnell students to great heights every
semester. But times have changed, and
Skip Day is on its way to the junkyard oi
Grinnell traditions to take its place
alongside weekly Chapel, segregated
campuses. and 50 cents Michelob.

Once Skip Day was sanctioned by the
faculty and administration 7 no
classes were held and the SGArbought
beer flowed lreely from the Forum‘
steps. But two years ago the faculty
rescmded its approval, and my
predecessor. Greg Youtz, was unwilling
to strike a compromise, The result: the
college continued Business As Usual on
skip Day, and the Administration
declined to help the students organize
and facilitate the activity.

This has adversely affected the event
in four ways:

OMany students have classes or labs
which they don‘t want to skip, thus
lowering the turnout.

olvtany proicssors hold pop quizzes
on the day. thus penalizing the students
who do skip.

oOur privrlege at using Forum
equipment tor the event has been
revoked, iorcing us to go to outside
sources ror loudspeakers and sound
equipment.

0 Resentment over the current status
of Skip Day has created an "Us versus
Them” attitude between students and
raculty.

The SGA cabinet has discussed
several alternatives to the present Skip
Day format. such as cancelling the
event entirely, moving it to Saturday,
iirohombing the Science Building, or
petitioning the laculty to reverse their

Beginner or advanced. By studying Spanish only, tour hours a day,

1978 decision to withdraw support.

We rinally opted for the latter option.
The SGA Joint Board approved our
decision unanimously, supporting this
resolution:

It a spring Skip Day
with ofﬁcial sanction by
the faculty should be
reinstituted, then no
5 Day shall be called
oi sanctioned by the
sun during the rail
semester.

We believe this is a compromise
which both laculty and students can
work (and skip) with

There are those who will complain
that this alternative offers no restitur
tion ior missed labs or classes, or that
the very meaning oi Skip Day implies

Our apologies to all of you who
came up Saturday night, You got poor
service because we were very
understaiied, Please try us again 7
We intend to do better.

that it is a deliance’ ol administra-
tion/raculty policy, But it a truly en-
joyable Skip Day is to be held, iaculty
and students must work together 7 not
against each other 7 in the planning
and implementation of the event. 1 wish
that we didn't need to bring the subject
up again, but I believe that our present
iormat doesn't allow us to have our
cake or eat it, and that the alternative
at least allows us to have the cake,

A spring Skip Day (which has been a
Grinnell tradition ror over 70 years) not
only allows Grinneiiians a chance to re
joicc in lite alter the iowa Winter, but it
gives students an outlet tor releasing
the academic pressure which conironts
us all, We should let the {acuity know
that we are willing to compromise and
ask lor their support.
