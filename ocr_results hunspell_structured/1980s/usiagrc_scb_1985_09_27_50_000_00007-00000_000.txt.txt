Tonight. the company will present a new

linois ~ Champaign/Urbana. and is an an-
thology oi Chekhov short stories adapted

New York Times Said “Orchards"
garnered “some of the finest talent in
America" in Maria lrene Forens,Spalding
Gray. John Guare. David Mamet. Wendy
Wasserstein. Michael Weller and Samm»
Art Williams.

Chekhov was chosen as the iocus of this
production because oi his “unique sense oi
character and his ability to balance comic
and tragic events." l-lis seven “rewriters”
are imressive artists in their own rights.

Dream Series which does not depict imr
migration to the United States. it was
chosen for inclusion because it is a moving
and heroic chronicle of Japanese emigra-
tion at the turn oi the century and because
it is a classic in the tradition of the
emigrants.

The story is centered on the firstrperson
'narration or a young Japanese woman
who, along with 800 oi her countrymen,
journeys hallway around the world to seek
wealth on Brazilian coffee plantations. In

Tlic young Chinese woman portrayed in
the him is searching ior her identity. She is
proud ol her lriends and iamily, she is
totally American However, at the same
time she is aware or racism and or being
considered apart from mainstream
Ainci-ica llow can you be proud to be part

whether it wants to fully accept you and

Scorsese. with his own mother and father,
emphasized the strength and richness oi
the ItalianrAmerican family culture.

While the ltalian father traditionally has
played a strong role. it is worth noting in
the film that the mother IS by no means
overwhelined by the father's authority.
The ltalian woman more than in many im-
migrant Cultures has a clear and distinc-
tive role. with important perogatives of
her own. She is far more an equal to her
husband than is the case in many other
cultures. \

Various cultures have different ways of
expressing affection. The rhetoric or love
portrayed in this iilm may not be that with
which all of us feel familiar. but it is clear
to anyone who watches the expressmns on
the faces of the two old people. and sees the
delight with which they banter back and
forth that they are deeply in love with one
another and that there is a strong warmth
between them which also extends to their
family and friends.
