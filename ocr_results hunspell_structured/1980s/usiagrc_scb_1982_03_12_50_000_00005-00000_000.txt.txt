After all the unpleasant verbal exs
ianges and physical violence I had seen
, town, it used to be really reireshing to
low that there was a drinking establish-
ent where you could relax, have a drink
at not worry about being hassled because
u had long hair, because you felt like
gging a member of your own sex, etc, I
referring, of course, to the college Pub,
I say “used to" because there have been
'veral incidents in the recent past that
ad me to believe that the tolerant ate
osphere in the pub is a thing or the past.
l the last few weeks I’ve seen students be
g hassled by other students for reasons
e the way they dress, who they associate
'th and the fact that they dance with
embers of their own sex.
I used to think that if Grinnell taught us
ything, it was respect tor litestyles dif-
rent from ours. I’m not saying we have
adopt them or even like them but how
nut a little tolerance here! We can go to
.rs in town it we want to see people being
ssled about dieir liiestyles _ why don't
‘ just live and let our fellow students live,

I the Editor:
I have just finished reading the Feb. 19,
82 issue of the 5&3 (Slander 8:
lacklist). Your caption “ALUM
" ITICIZES ACTIVITIES FUND” is un-
t, uncalled-for and indicates to me that
tle has changed at the 5&8 since “the
lid old days."
First, I did not criticize the fund! In fact
uggested “that the idea of an activities
idowment fund is an excellent one."
our editorial staff found it necessary to
t that paragraph out. Second, the pure
ise or my letter was to offer a more
orkable Solution to the problem of fun
ng such a program, not to criticize or
Indemn it. Third and last my solution
ust have been more workable for it is my
derstanding mat the program was
opted as I suggested.
I believe you owe me an apology or at the
ry least a reprint or my original letter
. whole) wioi a new caption.
I await your timely reply and remain,

he Editor replies: According to
ebster’s Collegiate Dictionary, die most
Immon definition of ﬁle word “criticze”
as follows: “to consider the merits and
merits or and judge accordingly,” Your
tter did this admirably but every person

0 submits a Letter to the Editor does so
ith the implicit knowledge that the 5&8 is
stricted by space limitations Because
e had to edit your letter, we chose to
lete the section which we considered
ast important, Certainly, your praise
as interesting but the negative criticism
Iu included was most beneficial 7 SGA
id adopt your suggestion,

I feel that many of Mike Alexander’s
Imments [in his March 5 letter to the
‘ditorl require a reply. His original arti-
ie was, i feel, fairly sympathetic to the
ay community at Grinnell. His letter,
owever, revealed several points at which
ither true understanding or knowledge
ere lacking. He contends that harass

ent is due to a lack of understanding of

 

ays. He attributes this misunderstanding

to ”a Simple lack of interaction" and “in-
accurate sterotyping ot the gay communi-
ty.” One may wonder if there are accurate
sterotypes of gays. His seeming empathy,
though, is questionable if he is able to
assert that homophobia is a term gays
apply “somewhat cynically,"

Homophobia is a clinical term used by
counselors, sociologise and other profes-
sionals to reicr to the tear or people
relating to others who are the same, in this
case, of the same sex. The use of this word
is not “cynical" but realistic. It is not the
lack of understanding. per se, but the fear,
which causes hatred. The resulting
physical and verbal abuse exists
throughout society and Grinnell is no ex-
ception.

Finally, there is no “seemingly visible
sexual deviation.” There are those known
to be sexually deviant and those assumed
to be. But again, gays have been defined
only in sexual terms, 1 am a lesbian
because i derive my energy, time and of
fort from women rather than men. I am a
lesbian regardless of whom I sleep with
men, women or no one. More than
“awareness of society" (which is desired),
most gays want acceptance, not tolera-
tion; we want to be understood as full per-
sons, not as sexual deviants.

I know that no one wants this issue to go
on [or three weeks. The problem is that no
one wants it to be brought up at all. This
was Mike Alexander’s point and I com-
mend his action in writing. But what I, as a
gay person want, is ior my sexual orienta-
tion to no longer matter and to no longer be
reason for anyone's hatred. — S.S.

Alexander's works

To the Editor:

In a letter to the editor that appeared in
last week's issue of the 5&3, Mike AlexV
ander complained that “severe editing"
made his story about the funding [or the
GCGC unclear and vague. In the first
paragraph of his article, however, he
basically explains why the article was
garbled. Assigned as a news article, New
ander chose to change the angle of the
piece to include features and editorial
comments, No journalist has ever been
able to successfully combine three
separate stresses on an article and have it
run on a news page, This is why in all
papers, even our very own 5&3, there are
sections {or news, opinions and teatnres,
Had Alexander written a news article he'
could have conveyed an informative, sen
sitive piece on the unique and unfortunate
plight of the GCGC.

As a writer and editor I am very familiar
with both sides of the editor‘s scissors,
Writers put in many hours compiling infor»
mation and then putting it all together in
an informative, cohesive article and I'm
sure that Alexander's story was no dif-
ferents Editors realize the effort behind
such work and try to preserve as much in
formation as possible but are limited by
space. Anybody who has agonized over an
8&8 light table has faced the weekly
dilemma of space Vs, information. What
readers see in Once Around the Field, for
example, is usually as little as oneiourth
to onerflfth oi the original copy that comes
to the 53:8 office.

I also feel that it is worthwhile to
challenge and elaborate on some points
made in the letter concerning homosex-
ulaity. First of all, Alexander twice refer-
red to gays as sexual deviants, In his mind
they may well be deviants but since 1973
the American Psychiatric Association has
not even listed homosexuality as a sexual
deviation. In that year the term “homosex-
uality“ was replaced by “sexual orienta-
tion disturbance” and later by “ego-
dystonic homosexuality." The latter two

,terms are defined to mean a distressing

Playboy goes
to college

There was an article in the Feb 22 Des
Moiucs liegistcr about how a
photographer from Playboy is planning to
VISlt Iowa State University in order to filld
some women to appear in 3 “Girls oi the
Big Eight” feature, It you read it, a lot or
things might have caught your eye but
what caught mine was the fact that
Playboy is "running out or conierences to
picture "

Hey, it that's a problem, I think we
should try to convince them to do “The
Girls of the ACM” and come shoot some
Grinnell women,

Now I know, your immediate reaction is,
"No wayl That‘s just exploiting women."
But let me try to convince you otherwise.

(1) it all starts with, as David Salyers,
director of public relations for Playboy,,
termed it, a “discreet" ad in the college
newspaper. Now, the guy is asking women
he's never met before and will probably
'never meet again to take off their clothes
and pose in such a way as to arouse men.
And he does Hus “discreetly.” How can
you distrust a guy who can pull that off?

(2) They say the women don't even have
to pose nude. The magazine isn't after sex.
They want to show that college women are
attractive. Attractiveness can be shown
either clothed or nude Of course, if a
woman poses nude, she gets tour times as
much money.

(3) Salyers said. “Most things we under»
take editorially are relatively expensive."
You see, this is going to be a journalistic
endeavor, And Playboy is willing to pay a
lot of money to make this a quality jour~
nalistic endeavor, Now, i always
associated “editorially" with news and
newsgathering or some sort of informative
writing. But hey, maybe "editorial" can
also be associated with pictures of naked
women.

(47 Salyers Said, “It's tremendous ego

condition whereby a homosexually arous-
ed person wishes to become heterosexual.
Thus in professional jargon, homosexualir
ty is no longer considered to be a mental
disorder and homosexuals are not “de
viants“ as Alexander had said.

He also used the expression
“homophobia" in his letter but did not ful-
ly explain the word or use it quite properly.
In humans, bisexuality is more prevalent
than exclusive homosexuality, Churchill
(1967) suggested that society forces many
bisexuals to willfully become exclusive
homosexuals, “Because sexual contacts
between members of the same sex are so
severely condemned, some bisexuals may
be torced into making a choice and thereby
become committed to contacts with
members of their own sex rather than con-
tinuing to [ind sexual relationships wiui
members of both sexes meaningful. What
some call homophobia (Weinberg, 1972)
may actually help create exclusive
homosexuality." (Abnormal Psychology,
Third Edition; Davison, Neale). Clearly
the problem ol homophobia is more
serious and goes deeper than “inaccurate
stereotyping." v Jeff Raymond

To the Editor:

i am a '79 Grinnell graduate and during
my recent visit to campus, i brieily stop—
ped in at the Loose Hall Ball. 1 was very
disappointed and angered by what I saw —
three storetronts in the “Wild West” which
bore the words: “Hang 'Em High/3

 

satisfaction [or a woman to pose ior
Playboy It's a rcatl’irmation that you as a
woman are attractive. Who’s a better
judge of that than pinyboyv" There you
go, Playboy is the definitive judge 01' at
tractivencss Oh sure, 1 thought I knew
which women were attractive to me. Oh
sure, I uiought attractiveness also involv-
ed personality, disposition, possibly a
sense oi humor Buthey, l‘ve sure been put
it my place.

So you see, Playboy contributes much to
a college campus when it shoots there. So
let's all write a letter to David Salyers and
tell him to come to Grinnell

Did you read that housing packet we all
got in the mail? 1 like section VI, “Sex and
Composition of Dorms.” I never realized
buildings came in more than one gender.

i understand a lot oi you are complain-
ing about the noise in Burling. Hey, you're
going at it with the wrong attitude. I think
the noise is kind of fund Especially the con-
versations among the workers, For in-
stance. . .

lwas working at one of the Lables next to
the elevator shaft — or what once was the
elevator shaft —— and I could hear what the
workers were saying, At one point, one of
the men on the top floor yelled down, “You
better get out of the way down there, we're
gonna be throwing some stulr downt" I
then heard a lot of shufﬂing and moving
around and then, “Everybody out of the
way!'Z” ”Yeah, go ahead! ” I then heard a
lot of crashing and most of the other noises
associated with stuff being thrown down a
three-story elevator shaft. ,

It got all quiet and after a few tense
seconds the voice from the top floor Said, '
"I don't think we should have done that,"

So go to the library, listen in and have a
little fun.

“Whitie's” and “Scalpmasters.” I feel
that these smacked of racism.

i was equally offended and disgusted by
"Criminal Wanted" posters depicting ot-
fenders accused of rape, child abuse and
murder. Some may say it‘s only semantics
and these racist and sexist displays were
only meant in jest and not in seriousness.
Yet words have meanings which I take
seriously and which conjure up horrible
pictures in my mind.

/Not only was I very disturbed that few
white Grinnell students seemed to
acknowledge the images in these signs, but
it seems that white students at Grinnell
are increasingly taking little or no per
sonal responsibility to confront their own

,racist and sexist attitudes, I can only

speak irom my personal experience and
must say that 1 am still dispelling
sterotypcs which were instilled in me
while growing up in a totally white culture.
Nowadays white students seem politically
cool and sophisticated regarding their at-
titudes toward women and people of color.
It seems they've decided that they need
not confront their own racist and sexist
ideas because Americans already did that
in the Civil Rights and Women's Libera-
tion Movements. How wrong they aret 7

as. I telt more accepted and enjoyed
myself more at the alternative Reggae
Party, whose theme was nonrviolence,
than at the Loose Hall Ball.
