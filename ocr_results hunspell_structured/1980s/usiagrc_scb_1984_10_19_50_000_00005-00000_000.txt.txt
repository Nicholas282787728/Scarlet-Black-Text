Risque Business: Norris council states position

To the Editor:

We understand and appreciate
the concerns expressed about the
need to change the mentality that
condones or encourages the sex
ual or other exploitation ot women
tand other groups as nelll This
response is not an attack on the
letter to the editor or the ideas and
gtxils expressed in it it is also not
an apology in tlic party,

We want to express our distress
that our party was interpreted as
encouraging violence against
Vt omen. tor that “as tar from our
intent Vie were seeking a party
theme that was untried on this
campus We did not want to clone
any or the old party themes or
have a themeless party.

The theme wasn't the only new
idea that us tried that night, We
tried a guest appearance by More
Casserole and Wanted to insert a
slow dance every hour. Not
everything went as we had plannr
ed. but the input we have received
about the party trom people that
went to it has been almost
unilormly positive We learned a
lot about hosting parties and have
a better idea oi What to do to
assure a unilaterally successful
party. If. is unlikely we will use the

same theme again and we will
seek a less easily misinterpreted
form of advertisement.

We want to avoid any debates
about the interpretations of the
Controversial "Come dressed to
kill" post . but no will state our
intent. which unlike the meaning
ol the posters is not subjective.
'i‘hc Intent of the Comment “Never
say never 10 a man behind a gun"
was to refer directly to the state
ment “Come di‘ *tl to kill to the
Itisutie "Business party" It was
also intended as a pun in
reierencc to the latest James
Bond lllln. l\'c\ rr Kcrcr
Again. There was never any intent
to encourage violencc against
Women or any other group

But whatever our intentions and
your interpretations. the [act re
mains that a lair number of peas
ple were olfended by our party
and a great number ol people en-
joyed it as well. In the future we
will continue to serve the party-
going population or Grlniiell to the
best ol our ability and take steps
to make sure that no further
misunderstandings occur,

Objection to Koon’s response

To the Editor.

1 must comment that you have
occasionally been rather lax in
determining what qualifies as ac-
ceptable journalism. The most
flagrant ol these lapses was your
decision to print Karry Koon's
“letter to the editor" in the 067
tuber 12 issue of the Scarlet and

Black. Koch’s letter had a notably.

admirable goal. and it. was a need
ed response to a very offensive
situation. However. the letter
should not have been printed
because it relied on the sensa-
tionalistic. and it failed to make
the point that it attempted to
make.

First. Koon's description of the
rape at the University of Penn
sylvania was itself graphic.
bordering on the obscene. it was
tasteless and offensive. and its
presence in the Scarlet and Black
lowered the quality of the
newspaper toa level similar to the
National Enquirer or other
publications of that genrei

More importantly. though.
Koon's letter ellectively produced
the opposite effect of that which
Koon intended to present, Koon
explained that "rapes on college
campuses are not terribly uncom-
mon." However. instead of ex-
plaining what behavior is typical
but unacceptable. she implied
that rapes occur but every lew
years and that. in order to be
classified as a rape, the situation
in question must be as extreme as
the instance which she described.

It is difficult to glean [mm
Koon’s letter what parties such as
the “Risque Business" party ac-
tually promote are the common
occurances of one person taking
unfair and harmful advantage of
somebody else either because of
the influence of alcohol or at-
titude,

The letter in dispute tailed to ex-
plain that sex enacted uirough
psychological or physical coerr
cion beyond a “no" is a rape. She
Iailed to demonstrate that abusing
somebody's trust and failing to
treat the person with respect is a
rape 7 as in the common case of
coercing the person to engage in
sex when the person is not in a sut-
ficiently coherent condition teg,
because of alcohol) to make such
decisions. Koon's outrage also
tailed to explain that people otten
become dominant or insistant in

such environments as the one pro-
mised by the advertisements for
the “Risque Business” party. and

this. too. frequently results in a '

rape.
Because Koon's letter mentions
ed only the extreme case which
occurred in Pennsylvania. her let-
ter failed to explain these very im-
portant points that I believe she
was attempting to express Koon's
example. taken from a rare inci-
dent. diverted the reader's atten
tion from the problem of acqualnr
Lance rape as a common occur
rence. It is a common situation
that evolves from such attitudes
portrayed in the “Risque
Business" advertisements,

morality

To the Editor.

It. was not without some
cynicism that I read the latest
Scarlet and Black and when
finished. disgustedly put it down.
In the best tongue-incheek. tootr
inrmoulh tradition of moral sen-
sitivity. uie Scarlet and Black
presented a rather shrill letter on
sexist language and innuendoes
by Ms. Koon. an attractive piece
on Vtelethon and campus party
posters by Ellen Weinstock tl was
amused if no one else was). a
moralist piece by the Raymond on
the decadence and indecency ot
the coming Des Moines Playboy
Club (come on kiddies 7 even our
revered Senawr Jepsen has found
much more decadent pleasures in
Des Moines than the “tacky" and
”disgusting" Playboy Club will
ever have to offer). and an
editorial advocating genderless
language in the Scarletand Black.
After two pages of moralistic and
selfvrighteous dialogue. I felt that
my soul would be saved by these
kind and caring people; but in-
stead had all such naive hopes
dashed by Mr. Quashie’s piece on
the search for the ultimate stud
here at Grinnell.

As long as the right hand is
i oblivious to what the leIt one is do
ing. “the new morality" seems to
have at last reached the hallowed
halls of Grinnell 7 and with a
vengeance. Tacky, Mr. Charles,
very tacky. 7 Peter w. Britton

‘Kope’s journey’

by David Kapelman

Did you know that the sun dial
always reads mu alter dark? I
found this out the other evening on
one at my long walks ltake these
walks to sort things out so to
speak There is nothing more
rclreshiiig at times than to
wander the darkened corridors of
this ancient institution and let
one's mind lloat adritt in night air.
Women seem to understand this
bettcr than men. although 1 rarely
meet either alter 00 am. or so.

Instead. I am all alone. with
nothing but the Wind. and
sometimes the drops oi rain to add
to my lootsteps. or my skateboard
wheels on the pavement.

A woman asked me last week
why the sun dial hadn‘t been ad-
justed to daylight savings time. I
smiled. and then so did she. I
guess that is what Grinnell is all
about: asking stupid questions
and then smiling and remember
ing not to ask them again I
remember as i humorously tor at
least i thought so) explained to
her that the sun hadn’t been told
about daylight savings time. Now
that I think of it. is it not odd that a
sun dial doesnot change with the
seasons? It says a little
something.

what do you think about when
you go walking? There is so much
to think oi, is there not? I

sometimes wonder why l have
had it so good, and others have
had it so bad. I actually cry
sometimes over things like that.
Well. Sometimes I cry. other
times I just thank God that l'm
alive and I'm not being tortured
Did you know that there was once
a theological ditlerence in ltussia
over lhc number ol ringers one
should hold up at mass, and that
thousandsdied by seltrlmmolation
as a result ot this dispule" but you
know that SIX million Jews and six
million others died in gas
chambers less than lorty years
ago? Did you know that only
yesterday a Moslem was killed tor
the uinpteentli time this month in
indnnesta for his or her bellcis‘! It
is all so stupid

History just keeps goltig it
seems: I'm just trying to shed
some lieu light on the subject
Thomas Carlysle once wrote that
the revolution in France vials bad.
that it did not serve a useful pure
pose to destroy old institutions
Burke agreed with him. I'm not so
sure Was it not. Jeilerson who
said that it was the right at the
people to do what is best for
themselves it their government
does not serve that purpose"
History is the record of change,
Sometimes it is sudden.
sometimes as slow as the hours
spent on the examination in 40
B.C. at the capital of the Han Em-
pire.

Al all times history is in the pro
cess of creation. I am a creation
within it as is this that I write. The
question is: how can I turn what I
do. what I am. into something that
can help those that have already
suffered and those that are still
suffering? It seems that at the
present time I cannot. and it
plagues me.

I have stopped here on one of
my walks to let loose some of my
ideas, some of the silly things I
think about late at night, It is

helpful to write it down, There are
no answers here. just a lot of ques-
tions, 1'“ never get a job walking
around at night. but if I didn’t
\ialk around at night a job would
be just as oppressive as prison.

Where the hell does the lime go?
One minute I was 8 years old and
standing on a street corner. and
the next 1 was iii some college
halt-d-million miles Irom nowhere
leeling that angst that no one
should suitor Is it the lot nfall liv-
ing things to be intermittently
conii'onted with their own wor-
thlessltess in the face of the whole
01 Creation” How can I break the
bonds of my own language. my
own culture" [)0 I Want to break
those bands? When I was fifteen
or so l was given the phlacteries ol
my religion. the Tzi'illin While the
ltabbi said the prayer in his
mobile van that he worked out of
on Central Park West in New
York. two cretins passed by and
said. "an, luuuccckkken
Heeeebes!” and then threw milk
into the van. Is this what I have to
look lorward tol Maybe i ought to
just quit and become a gare
bageman,

“Isolated incidences” aside. the
world is a very beautiful and ugly
place. I guess no great people ever
got there without suffering. I once
met an old black man In a bus sta-
tion He had a harmonica. I asked
him to play. He said he didn’t
want to bother anyone. Aiter both
my prodding and an old lady‘s
who recognized him as a master
gospel/blues player. he did. but
then. just as he was getting going.
he halted, “Better stop.” he said
through his bulbous lips and look-
ing at me through his blind eyes
the had a cane). “I'm gettin' too
happy.” I’d better stop too.

I am so tired. it is getting late
now. The electric clock says it is
2:40. but I know ditferent. It is
1:40 by sun dail time.
