1 have this dream of someday packing
ihccntir GrinncllCotlege student body in-
to Herrick Chapel and saying. ”Will
everyone who has ever thought about
translerring please raisehis or her hand?"
I would then ask those who didn‘t have
him hands up, the ones who had never
once considered transierring irom Grin-
ncll, to step toward. And I would have
them promptly escorted to the Health
Center tor a scrics of psychiatric cxamina
lions Free at charge. at course.

There probably wouldn't he very many.
though. Just about everyone I've talked to.
it seems, has thought about lcavmg this
venerable institution 1 know l've thought
about it. I still am thinking about it. In
fact, I've applied to two other schools. I've
already been accepted to one oi them. and
I am now patiently awaiting my linancint
aid iniormatinn. This Is called ”keeping
one's options open "

“But Paul.” someone might ask (I don't
know whot, “Why would you want to leave
Grinnell'?”

Gee. I don't know. Where would i start?

Ftl‘Sl oi all, to anyone out there who is
just waiting tor the chance to slap me with
a label ol sexist, racist, rapist.
homophobic, communist, tascist or just
plain ignorant, I would like to say that my
dissatistaciion with Grinnell has nothing to
do with the female, black, homosexual.
Republican, artsy-tartsy or various other
minority/oppressed/vocal populations
which inhibit this campus I suppnse so-
meone will take that statement by itself
and use It to call me all oi thc above. but I
really don't chi-c, l've lcarncd that taking
heal ior expressing oncscll I Just another
part at that woiidcriul. over-changing. iii-
lnmous GI‘Innell Experience

Speaking. ol which. there's reason
number one toi’ wanting to get out 0! here
I've had it up to my pituitary gland with
“the Grinnell Expcricncc "

To me. the tiriniicll Experience means
getting clbowcd iii the ribs at Gardner par
tics. drinking stale beer out oi uaroees

from the Outside

cups. and tearing one's hair out. week alter
week out oi boredom and trusti-ation. It
means trudging along to the same old
classes at the same times' every week,
scrawliiig down meaningless details in
notebooks, being lullcd to sleep in a hot
classroom by the buzzing iluorcscent
tights and humming radiators, while the
prutessor drones on and on. It means walr
cliing the clock and waiting for the bcll to
ring.

And that's anothcr thing. i don't know
why. but tor some reason i didn‘t expect
there to be belts in college At least not in
the same sense as there were iii high
school in high school you would go to class
and sweat it until the bell rang and then
you, were tree. tor a white anyway
Somehow i thought college would be dit-
iercnl. but it' not. It's the same old thing,
with a ten slight variations

irealizc that it's probably the same way
at other colleges. But I liguic, it I'm going
to be bored to death, I might as well do it
some place exciting. More exciting than
lowa. 1 mean And I might as well do it
some place where 1 don't have to study so
much.

Actually. i don't think the academics
here are all that diiiicull. They're certain-
ty not hard enough to merit all the whining
I‘m constantly hearing "l have six exams
ncxt wcck and twelvc papers due tomorr
row. Boo hoo."

or course. who am I to talk about \vhinr
ing‘? That's all I ever do. That's what I’m
doing right now. and what's worse is. I'm
having it printed in the newspaper. You
know. I think winning is just about the
lami'ite pastimc ot a lot at people around
here. I'd even go solar as to say that coni-
plaining about tlic Griiinclt Experience is
probably the very essence. tlic very heart
and soul of the Grinnell Experience. For
nic anyway

“What do you guys do at Giiimcll?"

"Well. mostly wc sit around and com-
plaiu and tool sorry tor ourselves."

But. it i do say so myscll, lccling sorry
tor myscli is one thing I‘ve always been

good at. I'm never really comiortablc
unless in pissed oil about something.
That's one thing that makes me hesitant
about leaving here. I guess I'm worried
that. it 1 went somewhere else. I might ac-
tually be happy there.

And 1 know I don't have to worry about
that at Grinncll,
