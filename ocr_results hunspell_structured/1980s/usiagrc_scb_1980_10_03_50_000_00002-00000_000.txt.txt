Regarding the Iconoclast

The first issue of the Iconoclast. the latest “alternative
newspaper" on campus, was somewhat of a surprise. The
overall quality was much greater than that of any recent
publication of the type and the issues covered were more
diverse than many had expected. On these counts I con-
yatulate the “organizers.”

However, one feature (The Saga of a News Story) needs
some correction, Kristin Layng’s description of the ‘non-
printing’ of the strike article in the S&B was correct as far as
it went, but a few points should be added. The, first week the
article was held due to lack of space, The second week we had
to hold the article because of a settlement vote was taken and
we didn’t find out the results (the contract was rejected) until
it was too late to include the story in that week’s issue. The
third week the authors were asked to write an update in»
cluding the strike vote. However, they declined and asked
that their article he removed from consideration Not con-
sidering the issue to be of vital interest on campus, we didn’t
pursue the matter. (The strike was settled that week.)

Other than their sensationalistic focus on this point, the
issue was well done The paper can provide a forum for
issues that the 8&8, because of limited space and its focus on
the college, is unable to address, Our only fear is that the
Iconoclast could degenerate into a journal of political
argumentation; its emphasis moving entirely away from
Grinnell, However, we hope that the Iconoclast will be able to
maintain its level of quality and diversity in future issues.

Good luck to all involved.

What your vote means

The election is still a month away, but registration
deadlines are drawing near. (See article, page 7.) Now is the
time to make sure that you will be eligible to vote on Nov, 4‘

When deciding whether or not you are going to vote this
year, remember these facts: 1) This year is a presidential
election year. Those voting in Iowa will also decide upon a
senator and a representative, two issues concerning the Iowa
constitution (the Iowa ERA Amendment and a proposal to
call a convention for revision of the Iowa constitution), and
many state and local officials Similar situations exist in
state and local politics in other locations. 2) Every decision
that the government makes, on the local, state, and national
level, affects you or your family in some way. 3) The election
is your chance to have input into who will be making these
decisions for you. 4) Your vote does matter. In 1960, Richard
Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy by 118,574 votes, or about 02
percent of the total vote per precinct. In 1968, Richard Nixon
defeated Hubert Humphrey by 510,314 votes, about 0.7 per-
cent of the total vote. The difference amounted to only a few
votes in each precinct deciding the election.

Accurdingly, you are urged to register to vote, either here
or in your home state. Which candidates you choose to sup-
port is your decision. Just remember that your choice will af-
fect the outcome of the election and the outcome of the elec~
tion will affect you for several years to come.
