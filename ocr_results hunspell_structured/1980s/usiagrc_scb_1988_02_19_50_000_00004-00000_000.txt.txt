One of the hardest parts about
having AIDS is not the disease
itself, but losing your identity. your
career. Being a chei was
something I wanted to do until I
could do writing and acting HavV
ing AIDS has kind of cut those
plans Oil. On the physical level it is
very devastating. I look healthy
because I'm heavy. when I first
got pneumocyslis I 1513th pounds
in just two weeks. but I've gained it
all back. But inside of me is the
virus. and I'm doing counterwork
against it.

portant that people have good sup-
port systems. Il you are not loved
by someone it is hard to love
yourself. People who aren't loved
go down the tubes really last. It is
hard to get people with AIDS to
come out of the closet. We need to
stand up and show respect for
ourselves and gain it from others. I

I'm taking AZT l An~

alleviate but not cure some of the
complications of AIDS]. and I do a
lot or mental work. I force mysell.
and there are times when I don't
really like It. to do public speaking
in Louisiana and Mississippi. I
believe in psycho-immunity, that
the system at thought can protect
the body no matter what the quallr
ty oi lite is. I don’t see myselI as a
victim but someone who throws off
how others define me to define who
I really am. I have AIDS. but that
doesn't mean I’m helpless. You are
talking here to someone who isn‘t
goingto support any stereotype

AIDs has sensitized me so I apr

scare myselt by telling myself all
the terrible things which could

back. then I have to cut you oil,
That is true with PWAs. too, If you

you're probably still a jerk with it.
I don’t want to be surrounded by
negativity. I'm accomplishing

I feel everyone must start with a
basic medical understanding of
AIDS before there is an understan-
ding oI its social and psychological
effects. I do (our seminars a year
which are open to the public. We
have doctors, lawyers, [and]
hospice workers speak about
AIDS, We use the seminars to
educate people who want to be
volunteers for the Buddy Program
[a group of volunteers who run er-
rands and spend time with PWAs]
or the AIDS hotline,

New Orleans is a little dlIIerent
[from other cities in the South]
because it is more 0K to he gay. It
has always been that a lot of gay
people would move here to come
out. Now many are coming here
after they have been diagnosed
because there is more acceptance
and better understanding here.

I've been involved in this l0l' six
years, I took my posi on here as a
health educator doing counseling

for HIV [Humano-lmmunOr
Deliciency Virusl people There
were problems because a lot oI
people get tested by places with no
pre or post-test counseling And
then they get a letter saying
they're HIV positive. and they
don't know what It means. A lot at
them think that it means they have
AIDS. when it only means they
have antibodies to the virus,
Whether you are negative or
positive, the message is still the
same — practice safer sex, eat
well. be healthy.

Knowing you are positive might
not change anything for some peor
ple. For others it can be very
traumatic. That is why pretest
counseling is so important I would
not encourage everyone to go out
and get tested. If I asked someone

what they were going to do it they
tested positive and they said they
would blow their brains out, then I
would advise them that maybe
testing was not for them

We are fighting two different
epidemics here Ithe disease and
accompanying ignorance]: and
one is not particularly worse than
the other. There is so much fear
and misunderstanding. Some peo»
ple lind that when their employers
find out they have AIDS, they sud-
denly decide to cut down in the air
lice. and they are the one to go We
get calls here from people who ask
if they could get AIDS from going
to a restaurant where the Chet ls
gay. One or my favorites was when
someone called and said they went
to a party where there was so»
meonc who was gay. The person
said that the man was standing by
the dip. They wondered. il he had
AIDS, could he have given it to so
mcone else by dipping his chip in
the dip.

One of the
AIDS is thati
disease when a disproportionate
number at PWAs are people of cat
or. Sixly percent of the women in
this City who get AIDS are black
Eighty percent ol the babies are
black. In the black community. ii
is mostly transmitted through It
drug use and the sharing oi
needles. In Louisiana we don‘l
have as high a number as in Neu
York or Chicago because it is lega
to buy needles over the counter
But there is Still a lot of sharing 0
needles because people can’t at
ford them.

New Orleans is waking up to [I’ll

We are lucky in a lot of ways that

munity and the Catholic church is
obviously very influential here. In
South Louisiana they have pro-

ACC has an independent sense of
mission. It is part of the larger
