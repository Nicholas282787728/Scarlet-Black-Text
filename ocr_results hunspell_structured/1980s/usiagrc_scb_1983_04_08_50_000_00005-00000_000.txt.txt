In the weeks that have tollowed its initial

* The Virtues of whipped pudding
Richard Letcbinger

So you say room draw is coming up and
you're not quite sure where you want to
live. When you were still a highrschooler,
Student Affairs made your mind up tor you
7 they simply assigned you a room. but
now you're a (iriiiiielliaii, and Grinnelllans
are masters ot their own destiny. So,
where are you going to live'7

Well I'm here to present a thoroughly
unscientiﬁc review of the situation. You
know, the pros and the cons, North Cain-
pus is full or pros. and South is tull oi eons
Ah, you sense a bias in the approach oi
your tmldrmanncred reporter. Maybe
you're right, Maybe living on North Cam»
pus tor almost 100 percent or my Grinnell
liie has clouded my perspective But I
can't put anything past you, you sense that
bias again.

K, let's try to be iair. In making your
decision about which side otcampos to live
on. you need to know all of the facts Bastc
logic 7 get all the available intormation,
and then make the best choice that you
can, So here‘s the scoop: The Pub is
located on South Campus, and the rise is
located on North Campus. what else do
you need to know”

Again you think you've caught me Well
here's the lust piece or gospel truth that I
have to offer, while you would like to

gather all of the available information and
then make the most logical choice, i e the
smart way, you could end up getting a [err
rible number, and all your plans are shot
to hell In otherwords, the luck of the draw
really determines where you are going to
live — hence, you actually have very little
control oi your destiny .

Butwhat it you are lucky enough to have
a choice? Now we're talking. There is a
ditierence between residing on North
Campus or South Campus it may have
more to do with ambiance than anything
else, but ambiance can be pretty damn im
portant when you are talking about where
you are going to live [or an entire year,

So here goes nothing, Here is some
useless and trivial intormation that I've
gathered about each side or campus For
what it‘s worth. . ,

SOUTH CAMPUS: One or the most imr
portant aspects about living on South Carri»
pus that was near the top of everyone‘s list
was pudding. That's right, pudding; they
whip it at Quad and it's truly one or the vii»
toes of Southern lire

Next on this magical list is the enclosed
loggia, I'm sure that most of you realize
that the loggia is covered on South Campus
because that used to be the women's side
at campus In the rugged old days some are
chitect, in his iniinite wisdom, tell that the

female of the species couldn't bare the full
thrust oi the elements, For whatever
reason, it's a lot nicer to walk in a covered
environment when it‘s one of those "expose
ed flesh will ireeze" Iowa-winter days

A major function ofan enclosed loggia |S
direct access to the Pub, That is, when ll. is
one of those “exposed flesh will treeze“
towawmter nights you can walk tstum-
Die) in relative comfort to (back from) the
Pub. A ractor not to be taken lightly.

Throw in shorter tood lines, lltain
Lounge and an elevator and South Campus
stacks up quite well

NORTH CAMPUS: it you are wondering
how you can possibly live with normal pud-
ding, an open loggia, conventional access
to the Pub and long iood lines, never tear
7 there is lite on the other side or Grinnell.

First or all, you don't have to cross any
train tracks to get to class, tllerelore for
some deeprrootcd psychological reason it
seems that you're closer to classes A new
item on the pro side of the North Campus
list is the conveyor belt in Cowles. There is
something classy about seeing your tray
travel the path into the great abyss rather
than breaking it down into its constituent
parts yourseli. This fact should not be
overlooked as an intangible,

Obviously the PEC is“_ on North Campus,
while atone time this only-had value to the

jock set or our community, now everyone
is mto Jane Fonda aerobics, so there is
something nice about being closer to the
source oi physical education.

Finally. one oi North (.‘alnpus' greatest
attributes are ilat loggias. You just can't
sun yourscll with any confidence while ly-
ing at a 57 degree angle 50 North c- npus
scores a major victory over South Campus
on this comparison.

There you have it, then, a veritable
plethora or useless int’orination. what?
You stiy I've skirted the real question?
Well maybe I have, so I'll be brave, Many
people view South Campus as being made
up entirely oi di-uggies and North Campus
consisting only at jocks, So y, but i just
don't buy those stereo type i think that
this student body is too diverse to eonioi-m
to such rigid guidelines, Basically, each
side of campus has an ilidividual flavor to
it that is i-edeiined each year by the group
or students that make up its resident
population.

So my advice is to pick your room on the
basis of Size and its relative location to
things like the stairs, the bathroom and the
phone and not to worry too much about
which side of campus you‘re on. Besides,
everyone knows that it doesn't matter
where you live 7 as long as it's not Norris.
