Men's tennis plays in fall preview

Grinnell devastates division 1 Drake, 6-3

Grinnell’s Men’s tennis team showed
that it will be a force to contend with by
handing Drake a bitter upset last Satur-
day. The match was a makeup from last
spring's schedule, but the Grinnell team
lost no senior varisty players last year and
is looking forward to a possible conierence
victory this spring.

it was a Cold and cloudy day in Des
Moines with rain threatening most of the
morning and into the afternoon. Drake’s
tennis team, which competes both in the
{all and spring, was looking for an easy
victory over Grinnell, but was thoroughly
disappointed. Grinnell, led by returning
senior captain Derek Vroom, were
delinitely upset-minded.

Dan Silversmith played number one for
Grinnell, Silversmith lost his singles
match ln a hardrfought, threerset battle
with Drake's number one player. The
match Seesawed and could have gone
either way. Mark Cloud also lost in another
hardrfought match that was a tossup from
the beginning, Cloud won the second Set
with some brilliant volleying, but the
Drake man regrouped and came back to
Win in three sets

Grinnell's Singles victories came from
the four returning seniors 7 number two
Eric Eidsmore, number three Derek
Vroom, number five Joe Neri, and number
six Chuck Adkins. Although Eidsmore ad-
mitted that he was not playing his best, he
came back from a 51 deficit after winning
the first set to take the match.

Vroom, Neri, and Adkins were on the top
of their games. Vroom served and vollied
his way to win two hard-fought sets.
Vroom won the first set in a tie breaker
and was on his way to victory. The match
was tiercely unpredictable as both Vroom
and Drake broke serves back and forth to
stay in the match, Finally, Vroom came up
with some of his best volleying, pulled
ahead and took the match.

Just as Vroom took the match from the
net, Neri battled away at the baseline.
Neri’s baseline game was on and seemed
to pass the netcharging Drake player at
will. When Drake opted to stay back and
play the baseline, Neri increased the pace
of the ball and forced Drake errors. Neri
took his match 7-5, 6-2.

Adkins, returning from a year in Spain,

simply could not do wrong. He served and
volleyed to hold serve and then turned
around and pummelled the Drake player
from the basellne. The Drake man never
had a chance to get in the match, Adkins
overpowered his opponent and easily won
671, 671.

In doubles, Grinnell [00k a more conser-
vative stand. Cloud and Vroom lost in a
hard-fought match at number twodoubles.
The number one team of Eidsmore,
Silversmith and the number three team of
Neri-Adkins both won their matches with
some ease. Neri-Adkins, playing together
for the first time, were Somewhat conser-
vative in the first set, winning 7-5. With the,
first set, over, though, they began to play
more aggressively and whipped on the
next set 6—1. Eidsmoresilversmith were
never in much danger of losing as they
played their brand oi baseline/serve arid

Captain Vroom said after the match,
“Well, you’re always going to be happy
when you beat a Division One School, but I
think that it is really cool that this motly
bunch ot players could show up half
asleep, without a coach, and knock on a
team that has been practicing all year.”

Neri added, “Schools like Drake are
always looking {or the easy Victory by
beating Grinnell, so when Grinnell arrives
in disarray and beats a big school, that‘s
what ireaks live for.”

Vroom later said, “I think this victory
shows that we have the potential to do real-
ly well in conference this year, so we will
just keep practicing.”

undefeated on their road trip during

Women’s Field Hockey
Completing an amazing turnabout, the
Grinnell College women’s tield hockey

'team won five of six games during nine

days or road action,

The successful road jaunt gave Coach
Cathie Schweitzer's Pioneers a record of
eight wins, two ties, and three losses.

in contrast, the 1932 Pioneers averaged
only one goal agame while winning one tilt
and tieing two in 14 contests.

After dropping a 3-1 decision at Iowa
Wesleyan, the Scarlet and Black rebound-
ed for five straight victories,

They topped Luther, 2i, and the
Univeristy of Chicago, 1-0, and then moved
on to the Lake Forest Invitiation, where
they added three more shutouts.

At Lake Forest, Grinnell bested
Wheaten, Hi; olivet, 470; and Valparaiso,
a Division I team, 1-0.

“We really put it all together both oftenr
sively and defensively,” Schweitzer said,
noting that the Pioneers outscored the op-
position mz during the five wins.

The Chicago and wheaton games were
played in rain and a muddy lield slowed
the action in the Olivet and Valparaiso
matches.

Offensively, Cathy Cullen and Val
Mauck were the pacesetters, Cullen Scored
[our goals and had three assists while
Mauck was credited with three goals and a
like number of assists.

Danielle Walker netted two goals and
Cindy Clark and Susan Petes added one
apiece.

Schweitzer gave goalie Deb Nelson a lot
of the Credit [or the four shutouts,

“Nelson stopped a lot of threats," the
coach said.
