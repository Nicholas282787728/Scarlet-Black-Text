Bangladesh: from floods to famine

Disaster strikes home of Grinnell student

by Tanweer Aham

As the water recedes, the
tragedy of the Bengali people un-
folds. The recent floods, which
covered three-fourths of the
country, were the Worst in the
living memory of the Bangali
people. The damage and loss.
both human and material, is
immense. Whole Villages have
been wiped out Men and women
were forced to abandon their
homes to seek shelter in the
relatively safe areas. Their homes
have been ‘washed away.' The few
possessions that they had are all
gone. About 30 million people
are homeless. They have
nothing-~nowhere to go.
Completely abandoned, they live
without shelter. There has been
an outbreak of disease upon an
estimated 200,000 lives (the
latest figure I could get). The
losses in agriculture, housing,
roads, and human life are yet to
be accurately calculated.
Somehow or other, to me, these
ﬁgures no longer count. The
spiritual agony and terrible pain
make me, as any other Bangali,
lifeless.

Why this flood? Why this
loss of life? Being the

mmrﬂ

inhabitants of a delta region,
beneath the massive Himalayas
where the three great river
systems. Padma ('Mothcr
Ganges). Meghna. and Jamuna
meet, Bangalis are used to the
annual regular ﬂoods combined
with heavy monsoon rains that
come from the Bay of Bengal. In
fact, the regular annual flood
deposits of alluvial soil make the
land increasingly fertile. High
rain fall in Northern India,
artiﬁcial barragcs, lack of river
dredging, and other unknown
factors contributed to this year's
unusual and tragic ﬂoods.

The ﬂoods have already de-
stroyed approximately 3 million
tons of rice, worth more than US
$800 million. The waters have
swept away 4,000 kilometers of
roads, 250 bridges, and have vir-
tually ruined the nation's
communication and
transportation network. At the
moment. the prospect of a

massive famine cannot be ruled
out unless funds can be allocated
from external sources to purchase
food grains from the world
market Funds must also be used

to revttatize the distribution
network within the country
which supplies food to the
masses and keeps them from
starvation. Unless the water
level drastically recedes by the
end of this September, our
farmers will not be able to plant
next year‘s harvest. Last year,
too. Bangladesh faced a grave
situation, but thanks to co-
operation from the people, the
government was able to
surmount the difficulties. This
year, however. Bangladesh faces a
foreign exchange resource
constraint and simply does not
have the resources to overcome
all of the challenges raised
against it.

Bangladesh will not beg for
aid because it is the duty of the
international community to
support fellow human beings at
such a moment of crisis.
International support and relief
work is necessary to prevent a
possible famine. Unfortunately,
our experience has shown how
some donor states seek to use
food aid for political purposes.
For example, during the i974
famine, the US held up food aid
to Bangladesh because we had
sold to jute to Cuba Hence the
possible solution to the famine
situation does not rely on the
governments of the First World,
but rather on the world public
opinion. The people of
Bangladesh have asked the masses
of the wealthy North (Le. the so
called First and Second World) to
make contribution to emergency
relief efforts to prevent the need—
less hunger, disease and death of
men, women and children, Any

humanitarian contributions in the
United States for Bangladesh
should be directed to.

There's a I
Elvis in all

by Beth Wodzinski

except Matt Macho the
anti- says "Durrin I-Iynes'.
All names in this article are flc»
lional, to conceal the identity of
the speakers.

The majority of the students
on this campus have no faith in
the tabloid rumors about Elvis.
One student, "Durrin l-Iyncs,"
said, "I don‘t believe that aliens
would have bad enough taste to
kidnap Elvis." A very vocal
minority. however, is convinced
that Elvis is alive and well.
President George Drake (yes. the
real thing, that's not a fake name)
said only, "All I know is I‘ve
never seen him." Yet everyone
seems to have a different idea
about where The King is.

Sophomore "Durrin Hynes"
blames his rejection at Pomona
College on the administrative
position Elvis holds at that
institution. Perhaps this also
ex plains the fact that Pomona is
tanked higher than Grinnell on
the US News and World Report
list.

Yet our administration has
taken steps to equalize this
difference between Grinnell and
the Top Nine. According to
"Durrin l-Iynes," Elvis has been
spotted teaching Chinese here.
“Durrin” was not able to specify
which professor The King is:
students should draw their own
conclusions.

Several students noticed the
striking similarity between
Elvis's pelvic thrusts, and those
of comedian Emo Phillips They
drew the only possible
conclusion--that Elvis has

assumed the persona of Emo.
"Dllrrin Hynes" claims that the
lyrics to "The Mr Ed Show"
thcme played backwards say
Elvis and time are one and the
same." Where is Tipper Gore
when you need hcl’.7

"Durrin" drcw comparisons
between Elvis and another cult

figure. "I've heard mmors that
John Lennon is dead, but I don't
believe that either," he stated
emphatically.

"I know Durrin is alive,"
commented l'Bill Trimble". "but
I've never seen him naked,
