SGA surprises campus with Skip Day

Leaders changed minds after seeing student support

by Laura McDerlnith

Yesterday the SGA sponsored a Skip
Day for the campus community. Though
there had been some hesitation at the
beginning of the year about Skip Day, SGA
decided in favor of it. The determining
factor, according to SGA Vice-President
Teri Gould, was student support of the Skip
Day

Compromises were made in an attempt
to please both students and faculty. The
Ones, a band from Iowa City. were
scheduled to play at 1 p m. between Darby
Gym and Younkers facing north to
minimize the noise reaching central
campus. Because the weather turned
colder, however, the concert was moved
into Darby. After technical problems on
setting up, the group started playing at 2
pm. The choice of north campus rather
than the traditional place in front of the
Forum had been a conscious effort on the
part of SGA to be responsive to the faculty
who had, according to Gould, complained
of the noise resulting from the bands on
earlier Skip Days.

Other concessions included the choice of

weekday and the timing of events.
Thursday was chosen because of the
relatively low number of classes, The
bagel breakfast was planned for 9:30 a.m.
so that people with 10 a.m. classes could
participate, and those With 9 am. classes
could come a little later and still be in-
volved.

The SGA has a special fund for Skip
Days. The budget for yesterday's event
was $400 to pay for movies. the breakfast
and toys distributed in the afternoon. The
Concerts Committee paid $350 for the band
and contributions were taken for the beer
available during the afternoon.

There will be only one SGA supported
skip day this year, Although there was a
Skip Day last spring, SGA did not support
it. Instead, last year’s Skip Day funds for
the spring semester were combined with
the relay funds and Relays Weekend was
expanded. The SGA is satisfied With the
new allocation of funds, according to
Gould, and plans to have an extended

Relays Weekend and no Skip Day for
spring semester again.

Noise complaints and regulations examined
R.A.’s have received only one ofﬁcial complaint

by Julie Shefsky

A professor on Park Street complained
about excessive stereo noise from Langan
Lounge at about l:30 a.m. Sept. 12. Upon
receiving the complaint, Angie Upton.
resident adviser of Langan and Rawson
Halls went to the lounge where the
Rawson-Gates welcome party was being
held and suggested the music be lowered
to a reasonable level. “i was pleased with
how cooperative everybody was,” she
said. She then decided a fine would be
inappropriate.

After this complaint, Bob Towner-
Larsen, assistant dean of Student Affairs,
placed a brief explanation of the college
policy in the Campus Memo. The Student
Handbook states, “It is a violation of
college policy to play stereos or amplified
sound at an excessively high volume.” If

people who do not live on campus complain
about stereo noise “the hall from which the
noise is originating will automatically be
fined $20 ($10 if a collegeowned off-
campus house).” If the individual can be
identified he will automatically be fined
$10. ’

Stuart Mensinger, resident adviser of
Clark. Dibble and Gates Halls, said that
even though the rule states that violators
are automatically fined, “We try to take
thesituation into account" when giving out
fines. It depends on the individual R.A..
the time of day and how agreeable the
people are," he continued. “We’re trying
to re—enforce cooperation instead of fining
people." Upton said,

The campus telephone operators have
been instructed by Towner-Larsen to

notify the dean on-call or the R A. of the
dorm to deal with noise complaints.
Townspeople usually call the campus
operator or the Grinnell Police Depart»
ment when they have noise complaints
about the college. The Grinnell Police
Department occasionally receives com-
plaints about excessive noise at the
college. When this happens Chief Bill
Peters said, “Officers go directly to the
place and tell the party to quiet down, and
as a rule it usually does." '

Other than the one complaint near the
beginning at September, none of the other
R.A.‘s have received any “official com-
plaints” from the town concerning noise.
Mensinger cited one occasion when a
resident mentioned on Sunday that the

Kellogg Grant funds mini-course
Course designed to increase sensitivity to agriculture

by Steven w. Way

A fall break mini~course on agriculture
and world hunger will explore American
options in providing food to Third World
nations. deal with domestic environmental
issues and include field trips to Iowa farms
and agri-business institutions. It is
designed to “increase sensitivity to
agriculture on the part of liberal arts
students,” Associate Professor of political
science Wayne Mayer said.

The workshop, funded by a $211,000
grant by the Kellogg Foundation to
Grinnell, Coe, Cornell and Luther colleges,
is the first step of a three-year program
that could result in agriculture oriented
courses being added to . the college
academic curriculum.

Tomorrow night at Grinnell House more
than 20 faculty members will meet with
Meyer to discuss ways they may bring
about an agricultural awareness, in-
cluding the interlocking issues of world
hunger and environmental concerns, to the
Grinnell campus. “The rationale behind
this is that a knowledge of agriculture at
liberal arts colleges has declined as the
number of students with farm
backgrounds has declinedijust as the
number of farmers has declined," Moyer
said. in short, he said, “Our knowledge of
agriculture has declined as'it has become

a more dominant part of the American
economy.”

The agriculture industry each year
generates $46 billion of this country’s
Gross National Product and food items
compose the greatest group of American
exports. In fact, over one-half of the food
produced here is Consumed abroad and
Meyer said the United States will “have to
face the question of what our export policy
will be. To produce these incredibly large
food exports we are pushing the land very,
very hard — using fertilizers and
pesticides heavily," Moyer said. “That
produces a good income for the United
States but it also puts great pressure on the
land; soil erosion is about as terrible in
iowa as anywhere.”

Moyer said US agricultural exports to
Third World nations will be a particular
point of concern for the future and he
suggested that those countries importing
American agricultural goods may have
served as a deterrent to their own self
sufficiency,

While explaining how to make the best
use out of the Kellogg Grant, Moyer had to
work around the problem that Grinnell is
the only one of the four colleges awarded
the grant that does not have a January
term, but he said fall was the optimum
time to look at farms in action. “The other

three schools will be putting things
together in January but What can you do
outside then except look at a lot of cold
cows?" he said. “With the dorms open
over fall break and the weather usually
being nice until the end of October, we
decided fall would be the best."

The course itself will meet in two three
hour morning and afternoon sessions on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the
week of October 19. Tuesday and Wed-
nesday afternoon sessions will be spent
visiting local farms; there will be one
wrap»up session on Thursday morning.

The course is being given on a credit»
erase basis and those students who Want to
earn the one hour of academic credit will
be required to read selections from five
volumes dealing with food and agriculture
that will be on reserve in Burling Library
prior to the course.

“I would expect farmers will be very
concerned about soil erosion but because
of the high interest rates they are not able
to do anything about it right now,” Moyer
said. “l would not expect them to be too
concerned about the effects of pesticides
since using them is very lucrative.

“Grinnell is not well situated for a lot of
things but it is ideally situated for studying
agriculture.”

music the night before was rather “long
and ion ."

Generally. this year there haven’t been
many complaints. According to Neta
Stewart. campus operator from midnight
to 8 a.m,, “It’s been rather quiet so far this
year." And Nan Robinson, resident ad-
viser of Haines and Read Halls, said. “The
students in general this year are much less
interested in excessively loud and rowdy
activities.”

Yet if stereo noise does get on a student’s
nerves. he is free to go to the Health Center
to get a quiet night’s sleep. according to
Andrea Griswold, health center super-
visor. She said ”lat already mis year three
or four people have come to the Health
Center to excape noisy dorms.

Note

Thereave two special notes that the staff
of the 5&3 would like to pass along to its;
readers.

First, you may notice that some of the
type faces in this week's issue look dif-
ferent from our previous issues, that's
very observant. Due to o breakdown ofthe
type setting machine at our printer, we
had to switch to the backup system which
doesn't print all of the type faces that we
normally use. We hope next week
everything will be back to normal.

Second. there are still positions open for
columnists. This is your big chance to let
your feelings be known. so don't let it pass
you by. lfyou've interested, send a note to
the 5&5 or call Richard Letehinger at
extension 5174.
