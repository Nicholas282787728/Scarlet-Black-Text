Mike Mullen takes to the rapids in Peshtigo River in

Wiscon sin,

Kayaking ecstacy

by Michael Mullen

Last year. on the St. Francis
River in Missouri I was scared.
No...scared doesn‘t describe your
life passing before your eyes in
an instant I thought I might die.
That‘s the lasting impression of
my first kayaking trip with
GORP. Shooting the ﬁrst major
rapids of the river, I got scared
and mew-d up, eventually getting
myself into the position of going
down a class III rapids backwards.
Flipping with water everywhere.
muffled sounds, and alone I
thought that this was the end.
After making it down the river
alive, I resolved that this was one
sport I would pass up

One year later, these were
some of my thoughts as I rode
the nine hour drinve to the
Peshtigo river in Wisconsin.
Remembering that illusive
adrenalin rush as I was about to
die, I looked forward to a more
controlled trip this time.

Seven Grinnell kayakers set
out to achieve peace with a river
that had a power of its own. I
resolved to atempt the very scary
looking five foot falls and
Horserace, a quarter mile of
continuous class III rapids. IfI
died. at least I wouldn't have to
lake finals. Taking off with the
beginners behind, Dave Zeiss,
Drake Bartlett and we quickly
made our way down river through
first, second and third drops,
stopping for a bit of playing
along the way.

We could only hear mufﬂed
sounds as we grounded our
kayaks and scouted the
impressive five foot falls. Calm
water above, the river plunged
into a cauldron of foam and

hydrolics. Watching Dave and
Drake negotiate it successfully
boosted my conﬁdence. Slowly
reaching the edge of the drop, I
peaked over into the foam below.
Ahead of me lay the line of
descent.

Giving myself the mental
okay, I dug my paddle into the
water sending myself over the
falls and into the abyss. The
kayak plunged through the first
backroller and disappeared into
the foam. I rounded the curve
leaning the wrong way. Instantly,
I felt the cold water. I heard the
familiar muffled sounds of
whitewater while hanging upside
down suspended from a kayak. I
tried an eskimo roll but a rock to
the head interrupted it. Another
attempt, no luck. Grabbing the
spray skirt, I ejected. Like a
breath of fresh air, Drake rushed
his kayak up to me and guided
me to shore.

After dumping the water out
of my kayak, I set off for the ride
of my life. Floating toward the
rapids I repeated the pattern right-
left—right, signifying the side of
the river to shoot the major
sections of the continous rapids.
Down through the first drop, I
began to wonder what I had
gotten myself into. Any second
thoughts doomed me to failure,
and I consciously wiped them
from my brain while yelling and
screaming in whoops of joy and
terror.

Reaching the bottom of the
final drop and into the calm pool
of water below I hollcrcd in
orgasmic ecstacy. I had conquered
my fears an reached the natural
adrenalin high that can't be
produced by any drug. In the car
ride back, I could think of
nothing else. lust the memory of
Horseracc brought back memories
of the ccstticy l felt, In the end,
I’m glad that this is one sport I
didn‘t give up.

Wine tasting Iowa-style

by Jeff Phelps

Last time, if you recall, the
topic of this column centered
around selecting wine in fancy
restauraan. Since then, I have
received many complaian from
readers saying that the infoma»
Lion given was inadequate because
it did not deal with the opposite
extreme. In fact. most people
report that the opposite extreme
is more the norm here in the
heartland. Because this will be
my last column of the year, I
have decided to scrap the “vintage
thing" scheduled for this space
(unless you are buying expensive
French or German wines you can
pretty much ignore vintage dates
anyway~therel topic covered!)
and instead talk about selecting
wines under less-thawideal
conditions.

First of all, you won't ﬁnd
many tastevins in Iowa restau-
rants. One local restaumteur rn»
herited some when he bought his
place of business, but he hon«
estly thought they were ashtrays
because the thumbholds made
such great cigarette resist l-Ie
ﬁgured the attached chains were
to be looped around the napkin
dispenser to keep people from
stealing the ashtrays.

In some places. the wine list
is nonexistent, or consists of a
stained sheet in the back of the
menu. This “list" may read:

“Red/white/rose—SZ a glass." If,
when you request a wine, the
waitperson says, “Wait a sec, let
me see if we have any left," then
returns with a half-filled bottle
topped with a screw cap, you can
almost count on a gustatory de-
light rated right up there with
boiled vinegar and burnt sugar.
All you can hope for is that the
jugwine served is of decent qual-
ity and that the restaurant’s wine
turnover is rapid enough that the
bottle is still relatively fresh.
Even simple wines deteriorate
noticeably within hours of being
opened.

You might as well forget
about the lasting/acceptance rit»
ual. I urge you not to smell the
screw cap - nose cuts can be quite
unsightly. You can also forget
about swirling the wine in the
glass. It's probably been ﬁlled
clear to the top, and any swirls
would only end up in your lap.
Asking for suggestions can be
interesting. too. If the
“suggestion” is prefaced by the
statement “I don‘t drink the stuff
myself; it all tastes like vinegar
to me," you would probable be
better off to stick with milk. If
the waitperson stands up straight,
rolls back the eyes in thought,
and goes in some recital about red
wine and red meat, you know you
are on your own.

Seriously, the situation in

Iowa restaurants is mixed. Places
with tremendous food. great wine
lists, and knowledgeable staff do
exist, but so do restaurants like
the ones mentioned above. Many
of the latter have excellent food
that could be greatly enhanced by
a glass of fine wine.

This situation probably won‘t
change anytime soon, but the
process can be hastened if you as
patrons are willing to stick your
necks out a bit and request better
wine selections. Most wine dis-
tributors are willing to provide
great wines and staff training to
their restaurant accounts, but
restaurants won’t ask for this
service unless enough customers
demand better wine than what is
currently available. You can also
“vote" with your pocketbook by
letting restaurant owners know
you will eat elsewhere it better
wine selection and service is not
offered You don't need to get
snippy, but honest talk does
make it to the owner’s earl

Wine enjoyment is certainly a
very personal experience. I hope
these few columns have helped
pique your interest and that you
will continue to explore the
world of wine as you enter the
“real" world. Good luck to those
of you leaving our community,
and to the rest of you—sec you
next semester!

Chinese marriages westernized

by Mayalee Chai

My American roommate and I
had heard that the Lao Gluing
Dong was one of Nanjing‘s best
restaurants and we had been plan-

ning our visit for weeks. We
were very disappointed when we
got there and a waitress said there
was no room for us. But then we
saw a small empty table in the
middle of the room

We pointed to the table. The
waitress looked at it, looked at
us. thought for a moment, then
shrugged and let us sit down. We
thought this a bit odd but sat
down anyway.

As we waited for our food, we
watched the people around us. A
woman in a bright red, shiny,
taffeta-like dress and a man in an
ill-fitting Westernrstylc suit
stood at one tnbic. They raised
their small glasses of [mi jiu (a
clear alcohol), As the woman
made the toast, the man passed
out boxes of cigarettes to the
men and chocolate coins wrapped
Ill gold foil to everybody else.

Everyone laughed boisterously.

As we watched the couple
move from table to table repeat-
ing this ritual, we slowly realized
everyone in the room formed one
big party. And then it struck us.
We had just crashed a wedding
banquet.

Officially, enormous wedding
banquets like the one we wit-
nessed are discouraged Ideally.
according to state propaganda, af-
ter the couple registers their mar-
riage, they should invite only a
small group of friends for some
tea and candy. Large banquets are
extravagant, bourgeois, and
evocative of the “feudal" past.
However, in the ‘805, they are
also fashionable and expected.
One recent survey found that 92
percent of all couples threw a
banquet for at least 15 guests, and
46 percent of these couples for at
least 50 guests.

Weddings are becoming more
expensive and more elaborate.
Whereas during the Cultural
Revolution elnphasis was placed
on the families’ political back—
ground and residence, today items
of a more tangible nature are de
rigueur. Many young couples
Consider the acquisition of fumi-
ture, a sewing machine, a televiv
sion, a bicycle, and pcrltaps a
washing machine an essential
part of the marriage process .
Since the average worker makes
about 100 yuan a month (about
$28 U.S.), buy’ g these items
can be quite a Irick.

"I will never get a divorce, I
can’t afford to, " a male factory
worker in his 305 once told the in
my English class. “It took me
10 years to save the 10,000 yuan
for my marriage If I get
divorced, it will take me If) more
years before I have enough
money to get married again!"

Whereas the wedding feast is
a throwback to Chinme tradition,
the West has also inﬂuenced
marriages in the ‘80s. On the
main streets in Nanjing, every
block has at least one photogra-
phy studio whose windows are
filled with pictures of Chinese
brides in full and ﬂouncy white
dresses. The grooms all sport
ties and Westem—style suits.

Traditionally, in China brides
wore red dresses because red is Ihc
color of happiness. When I first
saw all the pictures of the white
dresses, I was dismayed that this
tradition had apparently suc-
cumbed to the current fascinalion
with Western culture. But after
speaking with a friend of mine, a
computer-science professor at
Beijing University, I realized that
it has simply been modified.

My friend said that she had
worn red the day she and her hus-
band had thrown the dinner party
for their friends. But in the pic»
ture she showed me, she was
clearly wearing white.

“Oh, Ijusl put this on for thc
ptcture," she explained. “The
photographer owns the dress. I
just wore it in the studio."
