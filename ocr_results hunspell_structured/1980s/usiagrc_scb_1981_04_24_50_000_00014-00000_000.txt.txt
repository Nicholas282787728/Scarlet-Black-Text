 

Worley speaks
Out. . .

on Open Letter to President Drake and
the Entire College Community

The Grinnell College Calendar now
recognizes the Grinnell Relays and the
Campus Memo carries an invitation
from the president to all members of
the college community to attend a Grin-
nell Relays Mexican Dinner. I strongly
object to the college‘s oliiciai recogni-
tion‘ of this depraved, revolting and
damaging weekend.

The Grinnell Relays Weekend is com-
posed of three events: The Titular Head
Contest, the Beaver Breakfast and the
Relays. The Titular Head Contest is a
monument of vulgar taste. Egged on by
the enthusiasm of a drunken panel of
judges and drunken spectators. the
competitors strive to see who can pre-
sent the most obscene skit. The Beaver
Breakfast has two main components:
alcohol for breakfast while watching a
dancing nude woman, The best that can
be said for such an event is that it is not
held on campus. Free beer, races in
which cups of beer are to be consumed
as part of the races, games where the
winner or loser or both must drink beer
— these make up the Relays. No steps
are taken to make sure the participants
are of legal drinking age or even diat
they are college students and not high
school students. Somal drinking clearly
has its dangers; all alcohol counselors
havéi- assured us that competititve
drinking heightens those dangers to an
intolerable level,

For years, the Pub has refused to
allow its premises to be used for any
event connected with the «days. If
Grinnell College wishes to suffer the
embarrassment and damage connected
with housing such an event, I shall not
object, But that crinnell College of-
ﬁcially recognizes a weekend that
degrades women into sex objects, sex
into an animal act and drinking into
competitive drunkenness is an action I
most strongly object to.

May me competitors who manage to
stagger to the dinner puke their beer
and mcos on all the guests foolish
enough to attend! — John H. Worley

 

 

OPEN SPACE
Grinnell Relays IX incites controversy

. . . The committee answers

An Open Letter to President Drake and

Wednesday, you received a letter
from Professor John Worley, criticizing
the college's “sanctioning” of the Grin-
nell Relays Weekend. We are disturbed
by the highly innaccurate and inflam-
matory nature of this letter; such deli-
Ciencies of reasoning, {acts and cons
sistency are disappointing coming from
a.tenured professor of philosophy. We
are equally disturbed that Worley fail-
ed to contact anyone connected with
Grinnell Relays IX, either to air his
concerns or to check his facts. We can
sequently feel it necessary to clear up
Several serious weaknesses in Worley's
letter.

(1) “The Grinnell College Calendar
now recognizes the Grinnell Re-
lays . . ." The college has always
recognized the Grinnell Relays. Relays
Weekend has always been on the col»
lege calendar and has always had col-
lege recognition through participation.
funding, etc,

The item in this week‘s Campus
Memo does not mention the Relays per
se, only the all campus picnic, which
the college has always endorsed (and
usually funded). This year's picnic will
be on South Campus. far away from the
Relays events, This event has tradi-
tlonally provided an opportunity for
contact between (acuity, students and
administration,

(2) “The Relays Weekend is compos-
ed of three events." This is false. Two of
three events Worley mentions are not
on this year‘s official schedule of
events. The Titular Head Contest is not
connected with the Relays Committee
— it is planned by an independent
group, The Relays Breakfast is held off
campus and is funded by those who at
tend the breakfast The college is in
no way connected with this event.

(a) The Relays events themselves
are much more than just competitive
drinking. They are originated and are
intended in the spirit of satire and
parody, poking fun at competition.
pretention and the things we take too
seriously. They are a chance to relax
and unwind at a tense time of year.

14) “No steps are taken to make sure
die participants are college students.“
This is utterly false. The Relays Com-
mittee takes the same precautions that
are taken at all similar campus events.
There are isolated incidents of
“townies” drinking at Relays but this is
inevitable under the circumstances
The Relays Committee has always
made a sincere effort to prevent non-
college people from drinking.

(57 With regard to the problem of
social and competitive drinking, the
college sanctions drinking which is pro

hably worse at the Loose Hall Ball. etc.
And Worley, as a longtime fixture at the
Pub, sanctions the more frequent social
and competitive drinking which takes
place at the Pub. (“An excuse for a
party , , Professor John Worley.
5&3, March 6, 1981.t

The drinking done at the Relays is not
funded by the college. The money is
provided by students through donations
and purchases of shirts and rrishees,

(6) The statment that the Pub has for
years refused to have anything to do
with the Relays is a lie. In one last few
years crowd control problems have
forced the Titular Head Contest out of
the Pub; this, however, has only been
for the past two years. The beer is still
purchased through the Pub and is serv-
ed with Pub labor. It is distressing for
someone so close to the Pub to have his
facts so misconstrued.

Hi The final paragraph of Worley‘s
letter does not even warrant comment.
Such incendiary verbiage is highly
distressing.

The Relays Committee recognizes
that its activities are. on some levels,
decadent. We ourselves see no inherent
harm in this: no one is forced to par»
ticipate and it provides a useful means
of relaxing and venting irustrations,
Again. however. this is only one side of
the Relays ~ the other (bigger) side is
satire, parody and a celebration of spr-
ing, We believe that, taken in their pros
per spirit, the Relays harm no member
of the campus community

We do. nonetheless, recognize that
many members of the community do
not enyoy such activities. This year's
committee has. therefore, put forth a
major effort to broaden Relays' appeal.
We have modified existing activities by ‘
doing away with the "mud pit" and by
moving the picnic away from the
Relays themselves. In addition we have
vastly expanded the weekend to appeal
to a broad spectrum of the campus
community: we have movies. a hot air
balloon, softball, frisbees. etc. To the
degree that this year‘s Relays Weekend
has been sanctioned by the college. it is
because of these changes made in the
interest of creating such a broad opporr
tunity to relax and have fun

We believe this year‘s Grinnell ,
Relays Weekend will provide the entire
campus community with the opportuni-
ty to relax and socialize before the rush
of finals and graduation. The Relays
Committee has put forth hundreds of
hours at effort to make this a reality; it
is highly disillusioning to be confronted
with such an ill-informed, irrational at-
tack. 7 The Grinnell Relays Comniil-
lee, Wes Kennedy. chairperson
