Letters to the Editor

, continued from page 7

The article does a line yoti in describing
the type oi government that could be sub
cessful given sudden reformation, A pr0~
blem occurs in that there is no mention of
how this reformation is to occur. Exacﬂy
what will be the resulLs of divalment?

I maintain that divestment would not
result in a popular revolt. At ﬂ’le extreme,
full divestment would only lead to further
exploitation oi blacks as they scram bled
for those meager “handouts” that the
Apartheid regime might provide irhese
handouts would most likely take the form
oi very low paying jobs involving menial
or dangerous tasksl

At least now some U.S. companies (at
tempt and) are successiul in delying Aparc
theid laws and provide blacks with better
jobs opportunities. U s iirms have also
succeeded in getting better housing for
their workers as well as (through direct
funding) better schools.

l empathize with the need to abolish
Apartheid but until the practical results oi
full divestment can be exhibited 1 must
still favor limited divestment Reform will
be slow in coming through this method but
no other (incl, full divestment) has shown

that it can induce reform at all,

Ungodly Threats

There is a notion which is popular among

many in the current United States govern»
ment that the word “Republican is
synonomous with “Christian. " (Jr atleast.
that many Republican. and especially-
Reagan policies. reilect Christian
teachings, it seems iorgivable. however.
to humbly submit that this understanding
oi a compatability oi Reagan administra-
tion military policies, and Nuclear Arms
policies in particular, and the teachings oi
Christianity. and ultimately the teachings
oi Jesus. stem irom a misinterpretation lJf
certain Biblical passages.
-, Those who agree with Reagan ascribe
validity to the interpretation that refrain»
ing irom killing through the methods oi in»
spiring terror and animosity- are tactics oi
which the christian God would approve. in
other words. they hold that threatening to
destroy the Soviet Union. should the Soviet
Union threaten United states interess, is
the surest way oi avoiding deaths.
However, it seems that those who accept
this particular reasoning might be guilty
oi coniusing an attempt to avoid killing
with an attempt to avoid being killed.

Regardless ol whether Reagan and his
cohorts might be able to satisiy some quesr
tioners with explanations that the current
United States policies are actually in ac-
cordance with courses which are most
likely to avoid deaths, it seems likely that
it can be shown that ﬂ-lese policies are. in
iact. contradictory to the spirit and actual
intentions of the teachings oi Jesus.

Reagan administration policies locus on
threatening those who might endanger the
governments which are, in the eyes of the
current administration, iavorable >to
United States interests — the Soviet Union
is the primary target of these threats.
Reagan was quoted on page 29 or the
January 28, 1935 issue or “Time"
magazine as saying, “The word comes
that they’re [the missiles] on their way
and your only response can be to push the
button before they get here so that even
though you're all going to die. they‘re go-
ing to die. too."

This quotation might well be appropriate
to maintaining the proper atmosphere ior
effective Nuclear Deterence policies. but it
is. and the policy oi deterence itseli is.
directly in conilict with what Jesus taught.
.ln Matthew 5:940. Jesus offered to his
listeners that. “Blessed are the
peacemakers: ior they shall be called the
Childred 01 God Blessed are they that suf-
ici- persecution ior righteousness sake:
for their. 5 the kingdom ol heaven And.

I
believe that his nuclear missiles promote
peace to name them "Peace makers,"él
he Is familiar with the aforementioned
passage he might be iorced to reconsider
whether he is willing to suiier tor

righteousness sake or whether he is
more willing to punish.

Similarly. Reagan claims to olier
allegiance and faith to the Christian Goal.
but considering the hostility which he
holds towards other peoples espemall‘y
those influenced by the Soviets or other-
wise ruled by Marxist governments. one
might be forced to assume that Reagan
must not be familiar with Matthew 5323-24
which instructs. “If therefore thou offer
thy giit at the altar and there thou remem-
ber that thy brother hath anything against
thee; Leave there thy offering before the
altar and go first to be reconCiled to thy
brother. and then coming thou shalt fok‘!’
thy gilt. " it seems that according to st.
Mathew Reagan ought not to lie
simultaneously threatening the Soviet
Union with annihllation and offering
prayers to the Christian God, .

Reagan threatens and antagonizes those
who disagree Viith and might harm hid,
lhis attitude cannot be in agreement with
Jesus saying. “Love your enemies: on
good to them that hate you. and pray for
them that persecute and calumniate you.”
tMathew 5' 44) Nor can Heaganclaim thult
his policies oi nuclear retaliation are in
keeping with Mathew 5 39 42: ” ..if (the
strike thee on thy right cheek. turn to him
also the other. And il a man will contend
with thee in judgement and take away thy
coat, let go thy cloak also unto him. And
whosoever will force thee one mile. go with
him twain.

li those who support Reagan s policies
contend that the United States has a moral
obligation to protect ourselves and others.
they might be correct. but they certain‘ly
do not seem justified in claiming to be
Christian. Christians must be willing to
"suffer persecution ior righteousness'
sake.“ and “love [their] enemies: do goo
to them that hate [meml." They must
have iaith that living according to these
dictates will satisfy Jesus' teaching and
God's will, and that the resulting suffering
is necessary as a Christian alternative to
military- measures. Especially since the
nuclear arms race is using money which
could be used to feed. Clothe and sheltkzr
those in need oi which there are many In
the United States and abroad. Abandoning
nuclear arms and bemg willing to suffer
the persecution of the "evil empire” is the
only possible truly christian approach‘to
United states foreign policy

it seems that Reagan and his supporte'rs
who ascribe to( ristianity might not have
read Jesus' imploring. “And why do you
call me ‘Lord. Lord ' and do not the things
