Committee on Student Life
reiects campus lockup

by Jane Kaufman

The Committee on Student Life (CSL)
met to discuss security problems on cam-
pus September 29, in response to several
trespassing incidents that have occurred
this semester.

James Tederman, CSL Chair and Vice
President and Dean of Student Affairs,
outlined several measures discussed at the
meeting: “We talked about a 24.110“,-
[dorml lock up. , . We may be resissuing
security pamphlets. . . We're also looking
to ichange the] uniform [oi] the night
watchmen as a deterrent." Tederman ex-
plained the reason for rejecting the 24 hour
lockup, “The leeling was that that would
increase rather than decrease door
blocks."

Committee Member Todd Coulter said,
“The ultimate responsibility for sec-
urity hereat Grinnell College is depen~
dent upon students. li students want to
keep the campus Safe, then we all have to
take a part in making sure that doors
are closed." He called the reper
cussions of a 24 hour lock up “a catch 22
situtation,”

Meryl Spat, committee member said,
“People are not taking precautions. . .
They're still leaving dormitory doors open.
When one person [blocks the outside door],

they're Creating risks for everyone who
lives in the dorms,” Spat insisted. “The
potential tor safety is already there, it's
just a matter of using that potential. The
main problem is making people aware."

or several incidents of trespassing this
semester, only one person was charged
with criminal trespass. According to Grin»
nell Police Chief Jim Ahrens, in order to
hie criminal trespass charges, iirst a ver-
bal or written warning must be issued, it
the person subsequently returns to cam»
pus, then criminal trespass charges may
be filed.

Tederman approved of the police action.
“They have been doing excellent work.
They've been very cooperative."

Tederman cited six locations on campus
which havebeen associatedwithincidenls
They are: l) the lawn area south oi Fine
Arts and Burling, 2) the driveway west of
Darby, 3) the driveway between Herrick
and Carnegie, 4) the streetside of the
dorms on both North and South campuses,
5) the athletic fields north of the PEC, and
6) south and west of Mears.“General~
1y speaking, it’s best to stay on central
walkways. . We've increased lighting in
response to student concern. . . on campus
three times in the past five years,” said
Tederman.

Citizens Party seeks

by Owen Charles

1 he Citizen's Party is one or the newest
political organizations on campus attemp-
ting to present a viable alternative to the
Democrats and Republicans. The group,
which began organizing last semester
under the leadership oi Ethan Cohen and
Ron l-lankey, is now blossoming and pro-
mises to be a force in iuture political ac-
tivity at Grinnell.

According to Grinnell Sophomore Ethan
Cohen, the local group on campus is at-
liliated with the national headquarters oi
the Citizen’s Party (though only a iew
members at the Grinnell chapter belong to
the national organization), Cohen is now
co-leader along with Senior Ashley Smith.
The national organization currently has
chapters in thirty-eight states and may
soon expand to forty

The Citizen’s Party advocates ecological
socialism, according to Cohen, and was
iormed in 1379 by Barry Commoner. Com-
moner, a iormer protessor ol ecology at
Washington University in St Louis, was
the speaker at Grinnell graduation

ceremonies in 1981.

Commoner received 150,000 votes when
he ran for president on the Citizen‘s Party
ticket in 1984), but will not be running in
1984, “We don’t want to create the illusion
that it‘s the Barry Commoner Party,”
stated Cohen. instead, candidates will be
selected at a nominating convention to be
held in the spring. The most likely can-
didates right now are former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark and founding
member John Lewis of Atlanta, according
to Cohen.

Though the Citizen's Party opposes the
Democrat and Republican parties, Cohen
said that is is “not a revolutionary group"
and that the membership believes in the
democratic process.

Speaking about the party's possible im»
pact, Ashley Smith said, “As a political en-
tity it doesn't have much future in the next
fifteen to twenty years. The Citizen's Parr
ty will serve to widen the Views of the other
parties by taking the electorate away from
their candidates."

According to Ethan Cohen. the national
party platiorm is now being revised at a

 

Joint Board condemns
Solomon Amendment

by Mr Wolfgang Schumann

David Kopelman’s controversial prop-
osal condemning the Solomon Amendment
on consitutional grounds passed easily at
the Joint Board meeting last Wednesday.
The Solomon Amendment has sparked
significant student concern at Grinnell,
partly because of publicity mat came
about as a result or an open forum on the
issue held late last month on campus,

The Solomon Amendment requires
Students receiving federal financial aid to
sign an aiiidavit certiiying that they have
registered tor the drait.

While the Kopelman resolution passed
easily, with only a iew “nay" votes and a
few abstentions, its future had not been so
clear a week ago, when even the discussion
of such a measure was tabled. Many Board
members had objected to the political
nature oi his proposal, claiming that they
were elected to administer student govern
ment and not to represent Grinnell in out
Side matters.

Kopelman, who favors drait registra-
tion, maintained that the Solomon amend-
ment enforces draft registration uric
constitutionally,

“While 1 personally agree wiui the spirit
of the law, the way it is set forth is a lun-
damental challenge to our Constitution,"
said Kopelman last week At this week's
tneeting, he stated, “If you are rich, you
don't need government aid ~ because you
are rich. . . It you are in the lower classes,
you get totally burned . . People are not
being treated equall

Students' opinions were solicited on the
issue, but the response was minimal.
Kopelman had urged all hall presidents to
post a copy oi his resolution and to ask
students about it, but only a few hall
residents obliged.

Asked afterwards whether he thought
the measure would pass so easily,
Kopelman said, “You bet I did, I think
this is the first step in the movement [to
get Grinnell and other colleges involved in
national issues],"

A new committee, established by a
bylaw also passed this week, will handle
iuture resolutions oi this type. Called the
Committee on Student Politics, the new
committee will assume responsibility for
sending any letters of a political nature to
other colleges, student government
assocxations or outside media, CRS. will
serve as an advisory committee to
students concerning political resolutions
and suggest reiinements in composition
and parliamentary style oi proposed
resolutions to Joint Board CPS. will not
have the authority to alter or comment on
the spirit and intent of resolutions to Joint
Board.

TWO constitutional amendments which
had been proposed last week were dropped
in favor of the bylaw written by Vice»
President Pete Hautziriger. Raffacl Stein,
chairman of PASF (Political Activities
Support Fund), and Greg Donovan, chairs
man of the Rules Committee, had each
brought up their own alternatives to
change or replace PASF. Both were
debated at length and both were postponed
for further discussion.

For a constitutional amendment to be
passed, two thirds oi Joint Board and sixty
percent oi the voting student body must
concur.

Vice-President Hautzlnger said, “That’s
a hell or a lot of hassle ior something that
may never be used " Because of that, he
presented his bylaw Wednesday. “I sorta
pulled the rug out from under Raff
[Steinl's feet," he said. l-lautzinger had
previously told Stein that an amendment
would be the best way to reform PASF,
and had encouraged him to present his
proposal

“I think it‘s all set up pretty clearly,”
commented stein. saying that the new
bylaw was speciiic enough in stressing
Committee on Student Politics' advisory
role, “The structurvs kinda bizarre I
don't think it's that bad, , . I am willing to
drop my proposal in favor of this," Stein
said, Hautzinger‘s proposed bylaw was
passed on voice vote.

convention in Atlanta. Though the plat-
form will be binding for party officials, it
will not restrict local groups from
establishing their own views and perspec-
tives, he noted.

Cohen said that though the group focuses
heavily on ecological issues, the emphasis
has changed since 1980 “to economic
aspects more than ecological aspects." He
said that a fact sheet, prepared last
semester and now available in the post of-
fice, lists the current views of the Citizen's
Party.

According to Cohen, the group is in iavor
of: a mutually verifiable nuclear freeze,
assertive protection oi the environment,
nationalization oi energy industries,
development of true democracies in third
world countries, halting oi military aid to
repressive governments like that of El
Salvador, establishing a graduated ilat-
rate income tax to lessen differences in ln~
come, passage oi ER A., expansion of the
Voting Rights Act, increasing oi public
unlverstty iunds and student loans, chair
neling oi massive defense iunds to social
service appropriations, a national medical

i

care program, and discontinuance of the
peace-time registration.

So tar this year, the Grinnell chapter has
held one meeting and is planning future
meetings and a newsletter. According to
Co'hen, possible local activities include‘
sponsoring films and speakers.
distributing the monthly party newspaper
Citizen's Voice, aiding Audobon/Mobe
with newspaper recycling, and providing
information in a reserve file in Hurling. In
addition, Cohen said there will be a group
of members traveling to Iowa City to do
volunteer work for Citizen's Party can-
didate Jim Schwab, who is running ior city
council there He also mentioned the
possibility of having several members at-
tend the spring nominating convention.

Cohen concluded that he would like to
see the Citizen's Party “wake up the future
middle class of 'America lGrinnellians) to
the reality and necessity or ecological
socialism, iar them out at their pseudo
liberalism, and then get them to elect
Citizen‘s Party candidates."
