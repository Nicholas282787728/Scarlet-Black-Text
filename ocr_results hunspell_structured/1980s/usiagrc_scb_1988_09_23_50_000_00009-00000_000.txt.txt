Too Much

by Matthew c. Macho
Filmed way back in 1934, The
Man Who Knew Too Much is
yet another great old mystery
thriller-drama by the master of
tlte genre, Alfreo rlitchcock. The
plot concerns a typical English
couple who get tangled up in an
assassination plot. A chance
acquaintance of the couple is
shot, and he gives the couple a
secret message to relay to the
British government. But anar-
chist assassins kidnap their child
-- one word about the plot to the
authorities and she‘s dog meat.
The couple thus decides not to
tell the police anything, but
paradoxically, they try to solve
the problem themselves. At the
film‘s climax, the couple is
trapped in the anarchist‘s hideout
just as the British police are

Alfred HitchCOCk's North By
Northwest and To Catch A
Thief, showing on successive
weekends in the Performing Arts
Series, offer opportunity to make
interesting comparisons. Both
pictures are suspense thrillers,
but Northwest uses a far broader
setting -- the streets of New York
and Chicago, the United Nations
Building, Grand Central Station,
Mount Rushmore, and the barren
Midwestern prairie as a
background for its intrigue.
Comparison may also be drawn
between Hitchcock‘s direction of
his star Cary Grant in the
"serious" context of Northwest
and the tongue-in»cheek contrast
of To Catch A Thief. In
addition, comparisons can be
. drawn between Hitchcock's
direction of Eva Marie Saint and
Elia Kazan's direction of her in
. On The Waterfront,

The Making ofButch Cassidy
and the Sundunce Kid is a film
exciting in itself -- a celebration
of the creative process which
produced the original. Narrattxl by
those involved in the feature and
focused on special effects, it af-
fords an intimate view of the
process while still remaining
enjoyable to casual viewers.

Director Robert Crawford re
ceived both popular and critical
acclaim for his handling of
George Roy Hill's material, with
some critics labeling the
Crawford film "superior in

storming the place.

The sinister machinations of
Peter Lorre (M, Casablanca) as
the anarchist leader are well wonh
watching -- lie is simply a
scarred, diabolical ﬂower of evil,
a true poet of the damned. Watch
also for the nightmarish scene in
which the hero winds up in a
dentist's ofﬁce which he knows is
a front for the assassins —— and the
assassins know he, knows it.
"Open wide!"

The film is cleverly cut and
spliced together so that the tense
plot whistles by. The Man Who
Knew Too Much is an absorbing
drama, directed with staccato vio—
lence by one of the greatest mas-
ters of ﬁlm.

borrowed technique. he always
put his own interpretation on it.
This is strikingly illustrated
when in the final scenes of both
ﬁlms, his beleaguered heroes seek
"higher ground," a technique as
old as the ftrstWestems in which
the hunted "took to the hills" for
the ﬁnal shoot—outs. Used by
Hitchcock, however, this tech-
nique becomes a sophisticated
relative of the original.

North By Northwest is a
suspenseful chase ftlm, centering
on a case of mistaken identity.
Grant plays a debonair advertising
executive who is kidnaped by a
spy ring. The kidnappers
mistake him for a mythical agent
planted by the CIA in an attempt
to put the gang behind bars. A
series of misadventures follow in
this suspenseful extravaganza.

The Color of Money:
A cliche music video...

by Brian Strause

It is no surprise that The
Color Of Money. released by
Touchstone Pictures (a division
of Walt Disney), fails to be even
wonhy of comparison to iLs hard
driving predecessor, The Hustler.
Filmed in biting black and white,
The Hustler ripped out the heart
of pool room hustling and held it
up in all is pulsing glory. The
only pulsing offered by The
Color of Money, however,
derives from its superﬁcial top 40
soundtrack.

If Director Martin Scorsese
wanted to paint a picture of pool
hustling as all glitter and no soul
he did a pretty good job of it.
But if we are to believe this
scenario, Paul Newman‘s
character, Fast Eddie Felson, cart
hardly be taken seriously: Sure,
maybe Eddie has resorted to
running liquor labels for his
livelihood, but his ﬁre for pool
still burns and is fueled by Tom
Cruise's "flaky" Vincent, a
brilliant player with no brains.
Obviously, there is some sub-
stance in the pool hustling game,
but Scorsese proves himself
in apcble of wringing out any

by Scott Bemberg

Let me begin by confessing
that I like Tom Cruisc in The
Color of Money. I don't think I
need to make any apologies, it's
just a simple statement worthy of
any AA meeting. He was too
easy to resent in Risky Business
and far too plastic in 10;; Gun.
but in The Color of Money he's,
well, just plain Vince. Cruise
portrays a talented young pool
player who‘s a whiz on the felt
but not exactly up for a Watson
Fellowship. Enter Paul
Newman, recreating his role as
Fast Eddie Felson, the hungry
young pool shark from the
Academy Award winning, The
llustler. Felson's quite a bit
older now, but can sense a retum

 

to his glory days lhrougit the

true grit:

Shot like a cliche music
video. Color opens with a close-
up of a burning cigarette Such
oominess could only point to self
parody, but Scorsese probably
takes himself far too seriously to
fall for that line. The direction
only gets shallower as Scorsese
concentrates on the exciting effect
of pool balls ﬂying across the
table at blazing speed, while
failing to fully craft any of the
characters beyond simple
sketches. In the beginning, Fast
Eddie claims that pool is a game
of psychology. You have to
know when to hustle and when to
lay low, he says. The film does
not fulfill its promise of
exposing the psychology of the
con, as there is no real
interrelation between the
characters. A game of cons

without communication is like a
movie without an audience.
Retunt the favor.

molding ot the raw and mmwtttw
Vince. As Martin Scorsese
shoots a number of smoothly
directed pool sequences, the story
altcmatcs between Vince’s rocky
rise to the top, and Felson's mid-
life crisis, Ncwman received an
Oscar (although some reel it was
charity on behalf of the Academy)
for his credible performance. I
would like to have seen a little
more of Cruise (am I actually
saying this?) who ﬁnally seemed
to pin down a role where he plays
a likable human being. Ah well,
The Calw of Money is good
Scorsese and a good time.

can‘t help but think that high

Brighton
Beach
Memoirs

by Scott Eemberg

Eugene Jerome, what is it
about you that makes me want to
call home and say hello to grand
mother? Who knows:l Brighton
Beach Memoir: is a film directed
by Gene Saks. and Eugene
lemme is the alter-ego of screen-
writer Neil Simon. The film is
based on Simon’s play of the
same name, the first sequence of
a trilogy of plays based loosely

on Mr. Simon's youth.
Brighton Beach is a trip through
the life of a neurotic young man
trying to discover his own
identity amidst his somewhat
eccentric Jewish family.
Jonathan Silverrnan (some of you
may remember him for his sup-
porting role in the ﬁnal season of
NBC's brilliantly crafted l‘Gimme
A Break") portrays Eugene as
well as Matthew Broderick did on
Broadway: In fact, Silverrnan's
portrayal as a "nice Jewish boy"
is quite convincing. Hmmrnm
Anyway, the film follows him
through his misadventures on the
back streets of Brooklyn, intro-
ducing many endearing characters
along the way. Brighton Beach
Memoir: is not only an effective
piece of nostalgia, but also com-
edy that exposes the quirks of a
close family as well as "Gimme
A Break" did just a few years
earlier:
