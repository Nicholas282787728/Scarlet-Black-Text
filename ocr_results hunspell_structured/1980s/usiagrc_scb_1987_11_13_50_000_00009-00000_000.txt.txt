Boiled in Lead

to Melt
Darby

by Leii Larsen

As is oiten the case, it is easier to
say what Boiled in Lead is not than
what Boiled in Lead is: BOILED
lN LEAD IS NOT A HEAVY
METAL BAND, IL'S that hellrbentr
tor-leather moniker that can
mislead the uniniormed, but ae-
tually these guys are better
classiiied as “folk rock” 7 which
is not to say they wear ilowers in
their hair and bellbottom jeans
and do Peter, Paul, and Mary
covers.

Far irom it. BlL openly courts
comparison with the Pogues. the
Minutemen. and the Sex Pistols
Just because they are also com-
pared with the Chleltalns. the
Clancy Brothers. and Airport Coils
veittioii doesn’t mean they're hips
pies or wimps The much-
ovei-played p h standard "The
Gypsy Rover." the Yardblrds'
"Over. Under, sideways, Down. ,

and the beautiful ballad “The
Dreadnought" are all treated with
equal aplomb by these rogues.

am will keep the room spinning
in treewheeling abandon and un
tamed energy with a heady mix oi
tin whistle, bodhran, mandolin,
guitar. bass, drums and even
more. Initially, the impulse to do a
jig to a song with distorted guitar
may seem incongruous. but the
mind and body quickly adapt. pub ,
songs have always been brash
what's the harm in absorbing a bit
oi the Undertones and Stiff Little
Fingers here and there"

So bring yourseli down to Darby
this Saturday night. perhaps lor-
tiiied with a pint or two or the good
stuii and a smile on your iace, And
don't iorget your dancing shoes

Saturday. 9.30 P.i\l . Darby
