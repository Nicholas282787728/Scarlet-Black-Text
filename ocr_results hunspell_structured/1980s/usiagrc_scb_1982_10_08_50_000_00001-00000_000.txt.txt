The notion of Skip Day conjures in all
our minds a feeling of spontaneity and
freedom: certainly these characteristics
are integral for a successful day of
Celebration. but the tradition and history
at this day reveals many alternate and
conflicting viewpoints,

What was once called Spring tiny. n
laculty sanctioned and spontaneous day
off from classes. has been altered over the
years with the intention of making it :t
more intense and emotionally productive
microvacation Understandably. most
faculty members hold an unfavorable
opinion ot Skip Day Because of the or
tended fall, winter and spring breaks.
which were Shorter when Spring Day
originated. and With the numerous
distractions on and around campus. many
faculty members view skip Day as having
outlived the usefulness of the tradition
Whether this is if Correct assessment is
highly debatable

The roots of Skip Day date back beyond
President Turner‘s f'realiviti‘ Diiy, ~he

college nondenominational For example

the tubes, that’s where. The Spring Day
itself was not objected to: students and

faculty widely accepted it. It was viewed
as a necessary distraction. Keep in mind,
though, that there were few parties and

fewer and shorter breaks at the time, What
brought about the ruin and final disaps
proval of skip Day? The students were not
satisfied and their desire for a fall Skip
Day‘ was a gluuonous corruption of the
Spring Day tradition.

But the burden cannot be placed solely
on their shoulders. The leadership llf
President Turner could be viewed its
irresponsible and not representative of the
campus community as a whole. or the
faculty's lack of sensitivity may he to
blame

Whatever the final judgement, the fact
remains that with the structure and
frequency of successful Spring Days. the
students developed a desire for ti t-om
panion Skip Day in the fall

The debate over this issue between the
students and the faculty has lasted from
the early '705 to the present date, The
majority of the faculty rejected Ihe
necessity of the fall Skip Day. as it still
does. They argue that the fall term did not
needa Skip Day, since the creation of a tall
break allowed the Students sufficient time
off, Also, the faculty members thought the
anticipation of the winter break was
enough to relieve much of the students'
tension . Lastly, the faculty recognized the
imperative attendance of biology and
chemistry laboratories which a skip day
jeopardizes. But before the mldr7DS the
faculty was willing to compromise and
allow the Spring Day to remain at the
expense of the fall skip day

Does it seem unreasonable lhal Ihls
compromise has not been sustained and
that the Spring Day has been eliminated
too. or is the faculty correct in claiming
that the studnets now have Sufficient time
off. even in the spring” Regardless of the

 

answers to these questions, in the midvos
there were a number of fall Skip Days as
well as the traditional Spring Day, and
now there are neither. The reason for the
introduction ofa fall Skip Day. or. as it was
called then, Creativity Day. was in part
the inauguration of A. Richard Turner in
Apr‘iil 1975. Fall Skip Day is his "brain

Turner had his own ideas about this free
day, and the students were very willing to
take him up on them. The first of ’hiirner’s

spontaneous creativity: “If it's a piece of

the intention of being as spontaneous and

Turner's enthusiasm for the spring
Creativity Day festivities increased
student participation and furthered their
desire for a fall skip day Turner wanted a
