meeting. The trustees are being cautious
about granting tenure as the percentage of
tenured iaculty approaches (60 percent,
There is no quota or tenured iaculty but
Maytag said that the responsibility oI the
board is to "set long term strategy ”

As the trustees looked into the future.
they saw 32 more teachers becoming eliglr
ble for tenure in the next three years. If all
32 eligible teachers are tenured. the
percentage of tenured iaculty will jump to
about 90 percent. "Tenure builds lntlex»
lbilil' into the system." said Maytag He
stressed the difficulty of making tenure

decisions especially tor the ad-
ministrators. The administrators are part
of a small community that includes the
iacuity. tenured or not.

The trustees have spent a great deal of
time discussing divestment in past
meetings, according to Maytag The cons
sensus of the board at last week‘s meeting
was to continue with the present policy, In
other words. investments in companies in
volvcd with South Africa will not be
divested. Maytag regretiully expects "a
strong feeling that a large number of
students will be disappointed and will
uiink that the board is copping out.” The
trustees. said Maytag. "worked hard to
make the decision.“ He said that the board
felt that divestment itseli would be coppr
ing out.

”It would be inappropriate for Grinnell
to try to influence politics through in-
vestmcnts." said Maytag. People who give
money to the school intend to increase
Grlnnell's monetary strength. Continued
Maytag. "it would be irresponsible to do
anything that might endanger that." Grid

iected by divestment, according to
Maytag.

Maytag was impressed by the none
violent demonstration which took place
outside Grinnell House Saturday alters
noon. "Under the circumstances, they're
[the demonstrators] doing a terrific job."
Violence, said Maytag, would only have
created an antipathy between the trustees
and the students.

There has been no offical discussion
about the possible renovation of Mears
Hall. Maytag said, ”it's in George's
[Drake's] hip pocket right now. We bug
him on [the Mears renovation] every once
in a while " Some steps have been taken to
keep deterioration to a minimum. such as
extra night watchmen to discourage vans
dalism, Fire hazards have been removed
l'rom Mears to reduce rire danger,

The Mears renovation is "not high
priority." said Maytag. Nor does he expect
it to come up within the next year or two
The building is not. according to Maytag.
the best example oI that type ot architec-
ture but he feels that Mears is worth says
ing for historical reasons The decision on

Meals will be made alter the entire
physical campus is re-evaluated and a
long term master plan is developed. Until
then, the role of Mears is unclear,

The new budget "reflects the trends of
[this] institution," said Maytag, but he
declined to be specific. Maytag did not
mention the 17 percent increase in tuition.
Maytag explained that it is the duty oi the
president and his staff to decide on the
budget.

The bylaws have been updated and
streamlined. Maytag approved of the
changes and said. "It's a fine, clean.
logical document again." There was no
specific reason for ‘the changes. Some of
the bylaws had become obsolete and some
changes that had occured since the last
revision needed to be reflected in the
bylaws,

In general. the trustees are "cautiously
optimistic" about the future. according to
Maytag. The board is concerned about the
economy but they have worked hard to
keep Grinnell in a strong position to come
pets with other schools for the decreasing
number of college bound students

Book Store use down, according to McBee
Do students see. store as just a bank?

by Laura McDermith

When Thomas McBee. manager oi the
Book Store. arrived it years ago the Book
Store was contained entirely in the
downstairs section that now holds just texs
tbooks “It was old, dingy and crowded e
a typical college bookstore," said McBee
He continued. saying that he accepted the
position because he knew of plans ior
renovation and was offered relative
ireedom to develop the store.

The administration was anxious to
develop “a good bookstore." according to
McBee, “One contributionthat a bookstore
should and can make is having good out
side books available which can cultivate
good reading habits," he said, McBee em»
phasized the importance oi the nonrtext
book section by talking about the value oi
activities outside the classroom, In a
school like Grinncll, according to McBee,
there is as much to be learned from outside
sources as from typical class activities.

McBee thinks that usage of the store has
decreased since the early and midr'705. He

hypothesized that pressure may have in-

creased Since then. McBee said that he
related to students better when "they
hated everything” because "they come
municated." He misses the interaction
that he used to have with students

The Book Store Is a profit making enter-
prise and is part of the college. McBee
reports to Executive Vice-President Waldo
Walker and finances are handled through
the Treasurer's office. “The Book Store
makes money on paper," said McBee.
“but we're not charged overhead like a
true business.” The "paper profit” goes
straight into the college fund; It is not kept
separately for Book Store use.

Several students have wondered about
the procedure used by the Book Store tor
ordering texts McBee explained that the
whole process takes anywhere irom three
to four months. First requisition forms are
sent to the faculty. The forms should be
completed about two and ashalf months
before the books need to be in stock. but
that rarelyhappens, according to McBee.

The deadline for this semester's text re-

quisition forms was Nov. 15. McBee said
that about one half of the forms were in by
Dec. 1 and the rest came in after that and
even after the lirst of the year.

Once the requisition terms are turned in
to McBee. he must double check them all
ior accuracy and availability McBee then
calculates the quantity to order based on
prerregistration ior the class and
historical iigures for the same class taught

previously

Slow mail, damaged books or discon-
tinued books are just a few of the problems
that McBee often encounters. Sometimes
he miscalculates and there are not enough
books for a class McBee said that he has
learned to devlop a "thick skin" after
making mistakes

If McBee orders too many books, Book
store iunds get “tied up" in the process of
returning them for refund. Most
publishing companies issue credit memos
for the amount of the refund; McBee said
that the Book Store usually has about

nil-25,000 in credit memos

When the textbooks arrive, they must be
checked to ensure that the correct books
have been sent, Then the books are arrang-
ed on the shelves. After working for close
to four months to prepare tor a new
semester, McBee watches all his work
disappear in less than two days as students
purchase the texts,

McBee wonders what students mink oi
the Book Store. HE fears that “students see
the Book Store as just a place to buy tex-
tbooks, pencils and candy bars and to cash
checks." He mentioned that the Book store
“has become a bank " Sometimes McBee
must go to the bank twice a day to handle
all the students checks, He thinks,
however, that Check cashing is “a great
student service," »

McBee is “always looking [or new
ideas.” The Book store is still changing
alter it years under McBee's manage
ment, but “books are first; everything else
is secondary," he said.
