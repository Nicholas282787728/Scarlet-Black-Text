Mixing feminism

with femininity

by Carherine lngrarria

When the decision whether or not to
shave oue’s legs becomes a political
statement. something. somewhere has
gone askew. and a cermin degree of
honesty has been lost in a wave of
feminist rhetoric.

To a remain exmnt. such seems to be
the case at Grinnell College. especially
if one takes a glimpse at the stalls in
the women’s bathroom of Burling, The
question of the semester posed on the
southeast stall (the one in which closet
liberals. lesbians and feminisits wax
poetic) comes in two parts; “ls there
something inherently wrong in trying
to be sexy. and mn one be a feminist
and still want to be sexy in men?" The
ludicrounness of the question and
some of the responses it evoked makes
one question the notions with which
the ‘enlightened young women of to
day' are working.

The idea that feminism and ‘sex-
iness' (an unfortunate choice of word
that connotes bar stools. dim lights
and sweaty bodies) are mutually ex
elusive seems rather inane at best.
Adhering to feminist doctrine implies
merely a conviction to the belief that
men and women are equal. and women
should thus be neated accordingly in
social. political and economical areas,

Nowhere within the credo does it
state ‘thou shalt not try to be desirable
to men'. To believe somehow that it is

What is the S.G.A,'! What does it
do? What is it supposed to do? What
power does the S.G.A. have. and how
effectively does it use this power?
Many people have asked these ques-
tions. and with the hall presidential
elections just past. it seems a good
time to learn what we can expect from

A second dimension has recently
been added to the S.G.A.'s previous
ole of Campus Social Director. The
.G.A. now has the capability to

ional, and global concern. This

equired to post regularly.

"inherently wrong" for a feminist to
try. or want to try, to attract the op
posite sex smacks of nunneries and
fanaticism; indeed it belies the very
notion of equality. Certainly men do
not find it inherently wrong. and
somehow traitorous to the higher
ideals of their sex, to strive for
desirability when it comes to the op
posite sex,

Perhaps the problem lies with the all
too commonly accepted definition of
‘serw’. Unfortunately society has con-
structed a set of criteria which fall
under the category of ‘sexy' but which
in fact have little to do with true sex
ual desire: criteria rarely achieved
without the aid of airbrushes and
cosmetic surgery.

It is foolish to suppose that men [at
least the kind sensible women would
seek) expect that type of appearance
from all women. Maybe this attributes
the opposite sex with too much sense,
but most women probably would not
care to be with someone who considers
the amount of hair on their legs a
crucial issue.

Indeed it discredits both sexes to
assume men are disappointed to settle
for anything less than a Bo Derek
rephca. or that women do not feel
‘selfy' if they are anything less. Yet
Q1052 women who want. to affect. that
type of appearance. and do so of their
own volition, should not be castigated
by some ardent feminist.

leadership

if the minutes are not posted as
satisfactorily as every dorm has a
right to expect. or if the hall president
is somehow ineffective. the students
must tell their hall president that they
are dissatisfied. Hall President is a job
which requires time and responsibili—
ty. and those who run should be will-
ing to give this dedication to their
dorm and to the s.G.A.

With Student interest at. its current.
low. it seems appropriate that the
S.G.A. be as ineffective and unimpor»
tant as it has been in the recent past,
This recent election. similar to all re
cent S.G.A. elections, showed an alar-
ming degree of student apathy. Some
dorms had as poor a showing as five
students to elect their hau represen-
tative. The S,G.A.. however. has
potential to be a powerful and effec
tive force on national and campus
issues representing the student’s m-
terests, All concerned students should
make certain that the SG.A. needs
this responsibility.

the Solomon Amendment could in
spire similar reactions on other cams

have a profound impact on the

Not only should the 5,6 A. take a

S.G.A. emphasms the stagnation
which the S.G.A. currently

that the s.G.A. can be rejuvinated into
an effective body which can debate im»

benefit the entire student body.

work without the support. concern.

Obviously. perhaps all too obvious-
ly, it comes down to a matter of per.
sonal choice A woman can hold
feminist beliefs. shave her legs and
wear cosmetics. Until women can feel
equal to men while maintaining the
appearance they desire, they have not
truly achieved equality or sexual
freedom. The immediate rebuke from
a feminist would be “but high heels.
makeup etc. are a trap". Possibly. but
only for those who let it be one,

A few years ago in a “Bloom
County" comic strip. Steve Dallas asks
a woman what feminism means to her.
"Fat women. with hairy legs and no
dates on Saturday nights." she im-
mediately replies. Though amusing. a
note of truth regarding some
misconceptions about feminism comes
through. Men and women alike seem
to assume a choice must be made;
feminism or sexuahty. feminism or at
tractiveness; feminism or men.

in fact. the true feminist. a woman
in control of her life and herself.
achieves a balance of all moss
elements and many others, allowing
her to meet anyone of either sex as an
equal.

To the Editor:

in hght of the depletion of Grinnell's
minority faculty pool. several points
warrent elucidation. Among members
of the teaching faculty, black
representation fares less than a frac-
tion of one percent. The timely
discernment made by President Drake
and Dean Frazier of the implications
of a myopic decision deserves support.
if the Afro-American studies position
is not filled with a black. how would
those concerned be able to justify sear
ching for mmon'ties to fill any position
on the campus? The faculty and ad
ministration claim to be dedicated to
the effots of upgrading and
strengthening AfroAmcrican studies
at Grinnell.

As well. attention needs to be called
to efforts of the Affirmative Action
Officer and Committee. in its role as
an an coumnt advisory body to the in»
stitution. The fallible nature of human
decision-making requires an enlarged
scope of the immediate question fac-
ing the English department. It is im-
portant to hire a black English pro
fessnr at Grinnell who has strong
academic credentials as well as a
primary focus on AircrAmerican
literature and complementary caliber
to the English teaching faculty. Can
one object to this assertion. based on
Grinnell's traditional appeal to in.

tellectual tensnons — often spawned
from enlightened diversity in opi-
nlorls’!

We believe that a white professor
may possess the ability to treat and il-
lustrate AfroAmerican literature as a
serious. mainstream intellectual pur»
suit. However, one need not
enumerate the courses in which the
pertinent background of a professor
favorably influences his/her ability to
communicate a subject. Regardless of
the extent to which it is intellectualiz-
ed and given mainstream considera
tion. there is part of the Afro
American literary aesthetic with
which a black professor can exclusive-
ly identify. At Grinnell and the
students of black. religious. women's
and Chinese history, it similar value is
illustrated. For many students who
take such courses. the effect produced
is stamped with “genuine." For
however long and farreaching the ex.
periences of an “American in Paris."
the true Parisian “experience" is more~
ly a conceptual framework by which to
judge. but not to “know."

Even at a fine college such as Grin-
nell. students and teaching faculty
nlilre remain quite limitedly exposed,
An offspr‘ of a supremacist system.
such condiuons generally prevail at
predominantly white insu'tutions. The
prevalent historical treatment of black

literary works excluding those few
pieces which have been recognized by
the American mainstream literary
circles, has been to confine them to a
subliterary species, One has only to
delve cursorily into the history of
AfrorAmericiln literature to extract
the opposite.

if the American studies discipline is
to achieve any degee of stability at
Grinnell. it will need an anchor -— a
strong, solid one And if Grinnell is to
act upon its nominal commitment to
afﬁrmative action. such an anchor is
crucial for all involved. The hiring of a
white professor for the position in the
English department would guarantee
that the position is filled — for the
benefits accrued to a few, the issue
would be adequately settled. We
believe it is possible to hire a qualified
black (whose primary resis in Afro
American unrature) to occupy this
slot. of which there are undeniably
many. would not only fill the position
but insure the future growth and
stability of the discipline. depamxient
and student body. The academic and
aesthetic diversity of the English
department would be broadened. Such
a move would reinforce Grinnell’s
avowed purview of its intellectual.
