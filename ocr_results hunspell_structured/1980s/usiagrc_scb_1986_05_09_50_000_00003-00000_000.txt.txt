it a course normally required sell-
instruction. one would say the protessor
was doing a poor Job of teaching. especial-
ly in a language class, However, eight
students this semester can't blame their
professor: they simply do not have one.
No. they have not fallen into a hole in the
Grinnell experience but are participating
in the only "seltinstructional" Mnguage
program in IowLI' the ALSO Program

This has proved beneiic' l for those
students who participate in ol'fscampus
study programs. The three ALSO students
who went on the ACM Florence program
last semester reported that they could
communicate immediately with their host
tamilies and other natives

“It [ALSO Italian] was incredibly
helpful." Thom Barthelmess 1'87) said.

Although there are only two exams given
by a "qualiﬁed instructor" irom an
established university level program. the
courses are by no means ”blowsotis."
Students have to iollow an intense (13in
study schedule. using texts and tapes.
They also must attend three drill sessions
per week. each session conducted by a
native speaker, The exception is italian.
which is‘conductcd by .Gross. who is tlueiit
in‘ Italian- There are no native Italian
speakers available,

Sophomore Lisa Grant who is studying
Japanese pointed out a tow oi the problems
connected with the rigorous largely sells
instructed program.

"it requires a lot of time and eiioi-t.
especially with a language like Japanese.
Because of the amount of time involved t
could really be a [our-credit class." one
said This semester each ALSO language
is worth two credits per semester

The progiam s emphasis on the mad
tical acquisition ot the language to help
those planning to study abroad is one ot the
major reasons why ALSO has such a
healthy ioilowing.

For example in one or Gross's italian
drill sessions. students were given a
“practically-oriented individual exam"

* that was a tar cry irom the orals one usuals
ly associates with college,

'rl’ve'got a bag of pasta and wme and
such. The students get [real] Italian
money. and ivc go shopping.” Gross ex-
plained.

The exercise tested the students'
abilities to understand the prices and the
correct amount or change they should
receive,

Gross admitted that he has “always
been interested in languages. every since I

in addition to Italian. he also speaks
French ﬂuently, So fluently In Iact, the
native French assistant admitted that she
could not tell if he were French or
American when they iirst met.

He said that he has spent ”a lot of time in
France and Italy 7 every other summer
tor more years than I'm going to say " His

Wisconsin, Illinois. and Michigan ems
phasized French language and literature
as well as romance linguistics and
language pedagogy. He can speak ”smats
terings" or a number oi other languages

'and has studied Latin. Romanian, Russ

Sian. and Hebrew.

The only major complaint students have
registered about ALSO besides the low
credit rating is that it does not provide any
nntlons for advanced stud' .

Grant also [eels that i students are
Willing to put the time in. then they should
be allowed to go ahead."

Gross explained that when ALSO was
first proposed as a two semester program.
there were no provisions made [or a third
or lourth semester. .

“We didn't want to expand until we knew
how well it would take off." he explained.
He is “somewhat hopeful some kind oi
third or tourth semester" will be oiiel'ed
eventually. But of course. this depends on

the level or student interest.

mits that his specialty is philosophy, But
his interest in philosophy stems t'rom a
desire to “help solve human problems
bclorc a catastrophe occurs. One way to do
this is to open communication lines. to get
people to talk to cach olher.”

Mr. Moran is Iuliilling this desire
leaching Chinese language at Grinnell His
philosophical outlook has been a boon to
his students. tor he is reshaping traditional
methods of teaching the intricate
language.

Conventional methods oi teaching
Chinese involve the use of ”lists of translas
tions," in which an English word is
equated to its Chinese counterpart and the
two lists incmoi Led by students Moran
has designed a computer program to help
eliminate these translational problems by
allowing students |o equate speciﬁc ob-
jects with their Chinese names. In uddis

Vldlng immediate icedhack and pinpoin-
ting errors "

Additional materials include a booklet
that Moran compiled over the last two
summers which deals with vocabulary in a
manner similar to the computer program.
and also involves problems with syntax
