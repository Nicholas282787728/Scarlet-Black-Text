that, outside of the new conic

vantage the [new] building has
over ARH is that it is air colic

features or the math ﬂoor is
the math lounge, which 15 sur-

said, “The idea is to promote
more interaction outside of the
classroom between facility and
students," The math lounge
also contains the department of-
ﬁce, which has a kitchenette for
serving snacks at math gather-
ings in the lounge.

The math ﬂoor has one sem-

Knrin Sedestrom was asked if
she would allow herself to be
scoped. When she refused, cries
of ”You got no spirit" came from
the direction or the Loose group.
“Sitting at a table scoping qui-
etly is one thing. But being
scoped out by EVERYBODY
isn't cool," said Sedestroni, who
did not participate because “I
don’t feel that who I Bill is of»
fected by my looks. I don't thillk
its relevant. I didn't want to."
Commenting about the scope
Out in general, Sedestrom said,
“I don‘t think it‘s good. It's not
positivc. What does it get you?
What's the point? Some people
might enjoy it, but I don‘t "

Acharya wished to make clear
that the Scope Ont was meant
as a protest. The nninbers, in
particular, were meant to “make
the whole mental process that
goes on seeiu ridiculous."

Not everyone understood the
joking nature of the Scope Out.
“I“ had known it was ajoke, I
probably would have acted clif-
i'ereutly," said Sedestroiii. “But
there was no evidence that it
was a ioke."

Chris Pluntier did not under-
stand it was a joke, either. He
was asked to be scoped. ilc
obliged by mooning the scopers,

an action which Grant deemed
“nasty. Totally uncool." “It
was a bet,” said Plantior. “I
got 73 beers ror mooning them."

Not all or Loose nan panics
ipatsd in the Scope Out. One
Loose null resident who decidcd
not to participate spoke on the
condition that he not be iden-
tilicd because “although 1 disc
agree with what these people
have done, i do like many of
them, and l don't want them to
dislike me." This resident did
not take part “because i ﬁnd
the concept orscoping immature
and I don’t think judgmental at.
titudes should be encouraged.”
When told that the activity was
meant as a protest, this lesi»
dent said, “I’m sorry, but that
makes no sense. Mauish may
believe that. i believe that he
believes" that, but i think that
he’s naive. A hell or a lot or
people in this dorm got involved
with it because they like the
idea or scoping." Further, the
resident expressed doubts that
most people understood it as a
protest. “When did anyone say,
‘We‘re making {on of scoping?
i think it’s nice thcy asked peer
pie to volunteer rather than just
picking people out oi the crowd.
That’s good, But it‘s still scop-
ing."

Asked ii the Scope Out
brought dorm residents closer
together, Grant said, “Oh yeah,
we had a great time. We spent
three hours making Trshirts last
night. We got to know a lot of
the freshmen in the dorm. It’s
one way or getting everybody to-
getller and having a good time,
