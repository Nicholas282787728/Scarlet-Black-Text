“I guess this is really what I’ve always
wanted [0 do," said Brut. “Society exerts
sueh strong pressure on its tcmales to
revoke their roles as motherst

housekeepers, cooks e all the things
women do so much better than anyone
else. I've decided finally to stand up [or do
ing the things in hie I want to do. This
means putting on hold my work on my
paper, “Comparison ot the Journey
Themes in Huckleberry Finn and Moby
Dick,‘ but some sacrifices must be made
[or what one believes in. I want to help
other women who, like me, are having a
hard time resisting soniety's pressures. I
also have some great new rectpe ideas.”
