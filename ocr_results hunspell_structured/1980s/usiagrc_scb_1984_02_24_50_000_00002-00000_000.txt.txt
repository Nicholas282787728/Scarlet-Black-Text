Faculty discuss ‘measuring

excellence

by Jane Kaufman

“I don’t think you can measure
excellence," asserted Edward
Barboni, director of college
evaluation and planning, at Mon»
day’s faculty meeting. His com-
ments were in resposne to the sug-
gestion that quantitative methods
be used to measure excellence at
Grinnell, made by the Trustee
Faculty Relations Committee.

Gene Wubbels, chariperson of
the Faculty-Trustee Relations
Committee, listed “cumulative
and open records oi scholarly
achievements of faculty, students
degrees conferred, fellowships,
awards and career choices," as
the types of quantitative measure
proposd by the committee. Wubr
bels stated that these measures
would make it possbile for the
Grinnell faculty to compare itseli
with other institutions.

Some members of the faculty
showed reservations in adopting a
system involving quantitative
measures of excellence. Associate
Professor of Political Science
Wayne Meyer commented, “It
seems to me that before we use
quantitative measures we have to
know what we’re measuring."

John Stone, assistant professor
of mathematics and philosophy
stated “...nonquantitative data
don‘t have to be precise. Quan-
titative data are facts to deal with
and you don't have to be as sen
sitive to the nuances of
language.“

Alan Jones, Parker professor of
history remarked; “asking for

, listings of protessors; published
materials will affect the life of the
college.”

Wubbels replied that, “Too
much of our self»description
amounts to mere assertion," in
trying to explain the trustees'
view of the current evaluation of
the faculty.

President George Drake stated
the judgement is “subjective
’tiuimately, its human beings
judging human beings.” He
believes stout the trustees are
seeking “objcctivity,”

Discussion n moved to the
question of cur 'cular change.
Senior Jim Rabchuk, Curriculum
Committee member, spoke-ior the
students. He read Joint Board's
resolution which states that the
students prefer no curricular
change but that if a curricular
change must be instituted, the
Jones proposal would be more
tolerable than the Parslow pro-

Next, each of the division
chairpersons gave specific
changes that would be needed in
the Parslow proposal to ac-
comodate specific departments’
staffing limitations or
philosophical differences Some
make general comments regar»
ding philosophical differences in
specific requirements or options.
However, no individual opinions
were voiced.

In other business, President
Drake announced that the
Trustees approved the budget as
recommended by the faculty “for
the first time in at least five years
without bargaining." Stating the
reason for diis, he said, “We made
responsible recommendations.
We emphasized salary, library
and fine arts was] pleased to
see fairly rational delibera»
tions.”

The iaculty also unanimously
approved admissions guidelines
to be used for 1984-85.

Black political progress assessed

By Peter shiall

In his speech in South Lounge on
Monday, Feb. 20, Alan wheat
(‘72), the congressman from
Missouri's fifth district, stated
that political and social change in
America will only come irom a
recognition that “ ‘black issues’
are really issues of freedom which
must concern everyone, black or
white.”

In Wheat's View Americans can-
not consider memselves to be a
free people until the last vestiges
of slavery, in the forms of racism
and the poverty of a large number
of black citizens, are eliminated.
He believes that when these
changes are made that America
will be a better place for all its
citizens and not just for blacks.

Wheat believes that blacks must
break through into many different
fields to the degree that they will
not be notable because of their
race. “It’s the changing of a socie-
ty that we Work for, and not the
few high and individual cases," he
noted.

Wheat cited examples of pro-
gress made by blacks towards the
goal oi eliminaung their status as
“second class citizens". He menr
tinned the Harlem Renaissance of
the 1920’s as a time when blacks
gained widespread acceptance in
the arts. He then jumped ahead to
the late ‘60’s and early ‘70’s when
black activists such as himself
believed that they were on the
verge of transforming American
society. When he was a student at
Grinnell he and other black
students took over Burlillg library
in order to negotiate with the
president, Leggett over a list oi
demands. He noted that many of
thebromlses made, such as the
establishment ovalaclc Cultural
Center had beenkept. However.

he also drew applause for a com-
ment on the need for more black
professors.

He also believes that it may
have been a mistake that the Conn
cerned Black Students group of
his day refused to allow white
students to participate in their
political activities. He urged
black students to continue to be
politically active and to work with
white students for social change.

Wheat took time during his
speech to sharply criticize Ronald
Reagan. He said that Reagan's
economic policies are doing a lot
to perpetuate the existence of an
underclass in American society.
In the area of civil rights, he call-
ed Reagan “unstatcsman-like"
for his silence on the renewal of
me Civil Rights Act. He also calla
ed Reagan “very insensitive” for
his remark on the Martin Luther
holiday bill in which Reagan
stawd that the truth will not be
known about King until the open-
ing of the FBI files thirty five
years from now. ‘ ’

Saving his harshest scorn for
Reagan’s foreign and human
rights policies, wheat said that he
is ”personally disheartened to be
a part of an institution supporting
a reign of terror in til-Salvador."
Wheat compared the situation in
El-Salvador to that of Germany
under Hitler and said that we have
no excuse for allowing the killings
to go on.

The recent increase in the
number of blacks registered to
vote is one reason why Wheat is
supportive of Jesse Jackson's
campaign ior president. he ad.
mires Jackson ior having put
issues such as unemployment at
the iorerront oi his campaign.
However, he believes that the
most Important thing about
Jackson’s campaign is, that

Jackson is running not as a black
candidate but rather as a man
who believes that he is the best
qualified person in the country to
be president. wheat sees Jackson
as a symbol and a pathbreaker for
a future black presidential can-
didate who will be able to run a
campaign in which race is not an
issue,

In Wheat’s opinion, the goal for
black politicians now is to be able
to successfully run for office “at
any level of government, in any
area of the nation." In order to
achieve this goal, wheat asserted
that black candidates must be
able to appeal to a cross section oi
their constituencies. Presently
black candidates in races for high
level office rarely receive more
than 25 % of the White vote. Wheat
noted that the vast majority of
black members of congresswere
elected in predominantly black
districts, He asserted that in order
to increase the level oi white sup-
port, black candidates need to run
low key. well organized camr
paigns in which they appeal to
issues that transcend race.

Asked afterwards for some ex-
amples of such campaigns he
named those of Wilson Good,
mayor oi Philidelphia, Mel King
who ran for mayor of Boston and

Tom Bradley the mayor of Los '

Angeles. He pointed out that
Bradley was defeated in his race
ior governor of California not
because of his race but because oi
his stand on gun control.

of his own race for congress
Wheat said that there is no way of
knowing what level at white sup.
port he received in the primaries
but that his support in the general
election was very high. He con»
cluded, “Black candidates can
have success in predominantly
,wliltedlstricl it’s like the four
minute mile - it can be broken.”

 

 

Bobby Scale spoke to modem or Black culnii-al House on
Wednesday. Pholo by Mike Williams.

Bobby Seale -

still active after

by Scott Hildula and Owen
Charles

Bobby Scale, political activist
and historical black personality
who conounded the Black Panther
Party, was in Grinnell Wednesday
and Thursday to speak with
students and give the convocation
lecture. The following informa
tion, anecdotes. and quotations
were taken from two exclusive in-
terviews that the Scarlet and
Black conducted with scale while
he was in Grinnell.

Bobby Seale is one of the 1960’s
activists who has not renounced
his principles. In fact, Seale has
been and is still very active
politically. He has been involved
in community organizing, lectur-
ing, writing, radio programming
(he had his own talk show in
Denver), and raising money for a
foundation he is planning to
organize.

Seale has been asked to make a
public appearance for the Jackson
presidential campaign and is cur-
rently considering offers to write
a 1000 page book on “The Rise and
Fall of the Black Panther Party in
America.” A possible film script
is also in the works. Scale is now
in the process of writing a
barbecue cookbook for fund
raising and enjoyment. His goal is
to raise $10 million with which to
establish a major ioundation to
aid political/electoral community
organzations and "community
based economics" activists. The
foundation would give grants to
organizations and individuals
working on community-based
political projects.

While Seale no is longer involv-
ed with any organization similar
to the Black Panther Party, he re
tains much of the radical
ideological and philosophy from
the past. From among the labels
applied to political conceiousness
today, Socialism may come
closest to describing Sealc‘s vi-
sion. Where the Classical socialist
model and Scale deviate however,
is in the treatmen of the in
dividual, Scale dopes not Want to
see it centralized state control. lll~
stead he fol'sees for the U.S. a
grassroots representation.

“The people don‘t control the
legislative process today," he
said. Seale went on to level the
charge that as many as 3/4 of the
legislators in Congress today are
'under the control and monopoly of

all these years

the “corporate rich”. In this
group are big business and special
interest group lobbies which pro
vide major funding for the con-
gressional campaigns.

When asked if he felt-that the
radicals of the 60's had “sold-out"
and joined mainstream America,
he replied that the inherent and in-
correct assumption is such a
charge is that the Black Panthers
and similar radical organizations
were never outside of ”the
system” to begin with. He recalls
that he was quite appalled when
he read that Spiro Agnew had
described Huey Newton and him
as “hoodlums who were outside
the system." Newton had com-
pleted a year and a half of law
school and Scale himself was
trained as a carpenter, a jazz
musician and an architectural
draftsman. Both he and Newton
ahd attended college and were not
“huodlums.”

Scale sees the world as a total
universe where everyone is in
volved and cannot escape it. In the
60's he told a comrade who wanted
to escape from the conﬂict of the
society that he could hi—jack a
rocket at Cape Canaveral and
take it to the moon. The president
would still send the militia up to
bring him back. Seale feels that
even though the past radicals may
have at present established homes
and are raising families, what is
important is whether or not their
belief systems have changed.

59319. related his experience on
starting the Black Panther Party
and his reasons for doing so.
Newton and Seale were both doing
community work in Oakland,
Calif, in 1966 when they say the
need for community activism and
nrgainzation to curtail police
brutality going on at this time.
The Black Panther Party was in-
tended to be just that 7 a political
party that would field its own can-
didates and gain control of the city
council in order to have a police
review board established.

The Panthers began to follow
the police carrying law books and
tape recorders in order to exer-
cise their constitutional rights to
ohvserve police oiiicers on duty.
Thsi idea was not new (observing
police officers) but had in fact
been tried a year earlier by
anothcr group of blacks, The
prevmus group had been constant-
ly harrassed by the police they ,
