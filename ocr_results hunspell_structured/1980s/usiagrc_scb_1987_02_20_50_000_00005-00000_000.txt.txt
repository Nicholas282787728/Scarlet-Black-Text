Students pick up pieces
after parents} divorce

by Susan Prout

Divorce is spreading across the nation
very rapidly these days. More and more.
young adults are finding themselves with
multiple sets or parents Because of all the
adjustment that takes place, college
students are apt to feel an intensified mix
of emotion.

How each student deals wiﬂ'i the breaks
up of his family is greatly dependent
upon the individual family’s situation.
New relationships within the original fami»
1y also fall under the same dependencies.

Audrey Berns was eight years old when
she learned her parents were getting a
divorce, ”It was no big surprise,” she
recalls. “It was as if we were discussing it
because it was the natural thing to do, the
next step." College added a strain, though
considerable ﬁme had passed. and hard

was twelve, found out

feelings were brought up again. Berns'
father has since remarried and been again
divorced. Her mother has just recently
remarried (in August, 1986), and Burns is
now attempting to establish relationships
with her two new stepsisters.

The distance between the family
members, whether it be the original or a
new family grouping, can add to the strain.
Communication is a key factor. .One stu—
dent, who wishes to remain anonymous.
noticed that her parents were having troue
ble when she was twelve years old. She
was later told that her mother was a les-
bian, After she arrived at college, her
mother fell in love. The communication
lines were very open and although the stu-
dent was not actually meeting her
mother’s lover, when they did meet over
Christmas break of her freshman year,
things went smoothly.

Barb Krantz, resident advisor of Loose
and Read, said, “The students grow up and
the parents also grow because they are
forced to deal with each other in a new‘
way. There are many transitions.”

Another student, who also wishes to re-

main anonymous, has had many transi»
tions to deal with. all of which are going
well. Her parens divorced when she was
in the seventh grade and the custody rights
were split so that she and her brother.mov-
ed every two weeks, She feels that ”the
two people couldn’t live together in a pro-
ductive way." There was no pressure on
the children.

At the time of her graduation from high
school, there was much sentiment in the
air. Soon after, her parents started dating
again. They see even more of each other
now. And while she is reserved because
wanting one's parents to reunite is usually
considered childish, she is hopeful because
she feels they were still in love after all.

Some students notice that they tend to be
treated more like individuals and adults.
One student said that even though his
mother, previously divorced, is now form-
ing a new relationship, the distance
doesn't really matter because he and his
brother are practically adults. “Kids know
their parents more as individuals, not as
an allied force," he said.

It also helps when the children are not
pulled into the middle by monetary obliga-
tions. Brad Sheridan has an interesting
twist to his financial aid package because
his father is remarried. His stepmother
and stepfather have not combined
finances, and yet because they are mar»
ried, the college counts her income in his
package.

And how do all of these students feel
about marriage now?

Many students feel that divorce is just a
phase in a relationship, whether the couple
is reunited or not, Most of the students in-
terviewed were more open to changes in
relationships and not willing to remain in
relationships which just don’t work.

Specifically:

Audrey Berns '90: doesn’t rule out the
possibility or marriage, but would be much
more careful, and take more time.

Brad sheridan ’89: more open to
divorce, most of his friends parents are
divorced.

Student X '88: (engaged at the moment)
open, and if things don't work, then that's
just the way it is. Sex of the people also
doesn't matter, (In fact, she feels her
mother’s relationship is working better
than her father's attempt at new relation
ships.) .

Student Y ’90: you can't just break up
with someone or get a divorce and have the
problems go away.

dedicates trees

by Janet Silverstein-

February 14 was not only Valentine's
Day but also the Jewish Arbor Day, To
b’Shevat, the “new year for trees.”

0n Tu b‘Shevat one celebrates me giving
of fruit and other good things by the trees
as well as the tree’s growth. One oi the
holidays customs is to make a point of

eating truits that are prevalent in lsrael,
such as figs, dates, or pomegranates,

Also at this time, many people plant
trees or pay money to order trees to be
planted in Israel, usually in honor or so
meone, Hope that the trees thrive with
much joy this year.

Aquatic exercise

provides town-student
support group

by Sasha Aslanian

What began as a swim class {or adults
five years ago has evolved into an hour-
long aerobic workout, weekday mornings
in the Grinnell College pool. The men and
women range in age from 18 to 69.
Although several of the members are
students, many are adults who live in Grin-
nell and are not directly affiliated with the
college.

“Do you kids want to gossip or do you
want to exercise?” says coach John
Pfitsch as he teases his Water-aerobics
class into motion. The 20 or so members
tWist their torsos to Pfitsch’s “hup, hup,
hup" cadence.

The decidedly military style of the come
mands is incongruent with the atmosphere
of the class. Its members chatter amongst
themselves, occasionally glancing up at
Pfitsch to check and see Whether they are
on the right exercise. _

Pfitsch, who has taught the class since it
began, explained the origins of the exer-
cises, “These all came from football
warmups and even irom army
callsthenics It's all junk from the olden
days."

This “junk" is similar to what is taught
in the trendiest health dubs around the
country. Water aerobics provides a
challenging workout which is easier on the

joints than is jogging or dry-land aerobics.

“I swam one half mile on my 60th birth-
day and two years before that, i had never -
swam in my life,” Delores Smith recalled.

Another member, Jackie North, has
been in the class since its beginning. “i
joined mostly for the exercise, but we’ve
become more of a social group, With our
different backgrounds, we didn't realize
that we’d become so close, but we go out
for coffee all the time."

It is truly this closeness that makes the
Class so unique. All of the members agree
that they have become a support group for
one another. The class gets together every
couple of weeks at one of the members’
homes for lunch, and they regularly go out
for coffee after class.

For college students, it is a nice change
of pace to listen to discussions. about
spouses, children, going south, and home
decorating.

Freshman Bridget Thomas said, “It’s a
really nice contact with the townspeople,
because I wouldn‘t get to know them other
wise."

The attendance of the class ﬂuctuates,
and some people drift off to swtm laps near ~
the end. The few who trudge or bunny-hop
to the linish can always expect to hear
Pfitsch yell in mock disgust. “Now go on
home and take a bath!”
