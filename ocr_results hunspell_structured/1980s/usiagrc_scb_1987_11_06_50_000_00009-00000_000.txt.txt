Blow Up

by Bruce Emolld

Antonloni‘s “Blov Up" is not to
be coniused with the later “Blow
out," in which director Brian de
Palma paid homage to the direc-
torial and cinematic techniques oi
this italian predecessor, in “Blow
Up." a photographer. played by
British actor David Hemmings, is
taking random shots in a London
park when he notices a man and
woman in the distance. He
assumes they are making love and
photographs them Later. when he
develops the iilm. it is apparent
that the couple is struggling and he
continues to blow up thence the tl~

ing details are revealed

plaintively and smirks. Like
Bailey, this iilm does not age well,
Whereas Bailey is a Jowly has

“Blow Up” is like a pitiiul relict

Heminlngs is good: he looks and
acts like a photographer and
knows what to do in a dark room.
It‘s too bad he never did anything

There was. apparently, a big

question the myth on which he bas-

in many Ford iilms, particularly
those dealing with the military

there is locus to subordinate the m~
dividual will to a collective slrug»

nuclear lamily. ior some greater
