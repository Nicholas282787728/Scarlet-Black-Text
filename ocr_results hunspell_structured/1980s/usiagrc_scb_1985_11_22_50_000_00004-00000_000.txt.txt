Ravings of an angry old man

Throughout the now iniamous “Country
Hoedown" a couple oi decades ago. many
Grinnell veterans shook their heads in
disbeliei, ”Did this . ‘event‘ really
replace Oktoberiestt" is it true that next
year they're going to have a Fitties Dance
instead oi Oktoberiesn How could Dave
McConnell DO this? Well. I’m telln' ya.
kids. it isn't justdktoberiest. it'sthe entire
Grinnell Experience that's going down the
drain It took a “Country Hoedawn” in
p lace oi Oktoberiest to convince this angry
old man that Grinnell is. indeed. rapidly
losing its identity as a unique. liberal arts
institution .with each passing year. What
iollows are the ravings oi an angry old
man.

Members oi the ireshman class proi .

bably don‘t even know what Oktobertest
was unless they had visited Grinnell last
year last year as prospectives. Maybe the
iact that this college would sponsor
something like Oktoberfest persuaded
them to apply to Grinhell. Surprise!
You‘ve been had. Oktobericst is history as
a re many other traditions and institutions
once distinguishing Grinnell irom other
liberal arts colleges.

othej;1 unique characteristics will uns
doubtedly disappear by the time you
graduate. By then you'll be angry old men
a nd women telling the class oi 1992 how
great this’ place was in the old days. The
thought oi someone wlking about the good
old days oi 1986 gives me chest pains. 0hh.
m y heart. i remember what Grinnell was
like in the REAL good old days. so shut up
and listen to the raving oi an angry old
in an

I‘m telln' ya. kid. it was better in the old
days. l remember when people listened to
Reggae on blasters instead oi the top iorty
on Walkmans. Relays didn't have a icnce
a round it. students skipped classes on Skip
Day iany oi you sweet peas ever even hear
oi Skip Day?) in the spring. the iorum
didn't look like a sushi bar. a mud pit
separated Younkers irom Brown House in-
stead oi bricks. there was a room up on
North Younker third that was big enough
to play handball in. students were proud oi
the iootball team's losing record. playing
intramural sports wasn't a liie or death
enterprise. nobody ever slam-danced to
the ilash point where nonslammers got
pissed oil. vandalism was creative and
entertaining instead or mindlessly destruc-

' tivc. and, thought provoking gralitti

covered bathroom walls in the library "In
stead oi “who's got the best ass on came
pus" and cared jokes. _

Hell. i remember the days when Hurling
didn't have a box on top oi it and when Al
Jones had a iew dark hairs mixed in with
the grey. i'm trying to tell ya how good it
was in the old days and how you‘ve got to
hold onto what you've got. so shut up and
listen to the raving oi an angry old man.

Progress is a good thing. I've‘been told,
but can't we move ahead without
simultaneously moving backward" is it
impossible to have a Country Hoedown
AND an Oktoberfest? The disappointing

answer. l'm airaid. is no. you can't have
both. From now on you'll be stuck with
Hoedowns and Fifties Dances and
whatever other horror shows they dream
up ior you’ irom now on.

Beer will become verbnten at me
o ktoberiest and anywhere else on campus
thanks to a new drinking age. As a conse-
quence. two quintessential institutions at
Grinnell. Relays and the Pub, will become
a thing oi the past by next iall. You can't
point the linger at McConnell. the Grinnell
cops. George Drake. or even the Trustees
on this one The blame rests squarely on
the shoulders of legislators who have
recently decided tn relieve the under
twenty-one crowd oi a responsibility they
apparently cannot handle. Although the
worst one could do in a drunken stupor at
G rinnell is [all down a [light of stairs. Coma
mit social suicide. or get run over by a
train on your way home. every one oi you
y oung'uns must bear the burden of the na-
tion's soon to be implemented drinking
age. When federal law turns off the beer
taps on campus. the Pub goes under.
Relays goes under. and a signiiicant
a mount of Grinnell's “character”
e vaporates. You don't have to go dry. but
you can't drink with the oilicial sanction-
ing oi the college unless you're an angry
old man,

Despite the new drinking age and the
overall "conservative trend" sweeping the
nation. there are some measures the ad
ministration Could take to prevent the
demise of the Grinnell Experience. Aiter
all. they can‘t blame everything on the so-
Called conservative trend. This angry old
in an takes it {or granted that there are at
least 1.2th seniors graduating irom high
school each year who could take advan»

simply the ravings oi an angry old man?

You may also see the institution of

become angry old men and women. .

How about ROTC at Grinnell'.’ Imagine

ot them I‘m not saying we should go back
into the sixties. but c'mon. don't plunge
back into the Filtics either. As a Crinnell
proicssor 1th0 would have probably given
h imscll a lobotomy with a Bic pen had he
attended the Country Hoedowni once said
in a nasal sneer. "The purpose oi a liberal

the goal ol a liberal arts education. it you
want to learn a marketable skill you
s hould go to air conditioning and i-eirigera
tion school. Shame on all oi you ravcs this
n ngi-y old man.

This angry old man must admit. though.
that he's in no position to judge anybody
here. especially lreshman and
sophomores. The tact is, he's never met
them and has no other iricnds. anyway.
They've graduated transierre . ilunked
out. withdrawn. or presently study abroad.
Some have suggested that all seniors. in
cluding the old man. succumb to paranoia
at about this time oi their last year. They
see the diploma at the end oithe tunnel and
dcrelop an uncritical icai- oi Grinnell [allr

ing apart once they're no longer around to
hold it up.

Well. that's what happens when you get
old and useless. You lose touch with what's
going on. This angry old man is completely
useless in light oi the [act that he studies
abroad last year and lives off campus now.
He has divorced himseli from the com»
m unity but still. ior sentimental reasons.
worries about the fate of a world he is
about to leave. To the iew remaining
liberal skeptics left at this place he pleads
sincerity This angry old man is truly conv
corned about the tailspin Grinnell has
taken over the past iew years.

Secondly. the conversion of Grinnell into
an lvy League school makes us elderly
Grinnellians look bad. Ten years from
now. when I'm fossilized. I don't want
some high school twerp coming up saying '
“Gee Mr. MCGrath, sir, did you attend
Grinnell College? i'm applying to colleges
in November. sir. and well. frankly. i'm
impressed by Grinnell's straightiorward

massive stroke in response to the mere
hint oi comparing Crinnell to a iinishing
school ior yuppics. "His heart just couldn‘t
