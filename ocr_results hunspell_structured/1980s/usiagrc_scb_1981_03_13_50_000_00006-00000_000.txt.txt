IM players gripe: past and present

by Rob Brooks

The Grinnell intramural sports

program has recently come under
criticism by students for various
reasons ranging from “the refs stink ”
to “it’s too disorganized.” According to
Barry Huff, associate dean of Student
Ailairs, however, “The program is
more organized than when I went
here.”

when Huff, '73, was a student, there
were no hall 1M coordinators. Instead,
the program was organized “on a hall
basis by anyone who went around a
dorm and rounded up players." in fact,
the position of IM coordinator has only
been around for three years.

one problem that has plagued the
program this year has been the more
dinate amount of forfeits as a result of
not enough players. It is a bit
frustrating to round up a team and
trudge across a swampy Mac Field en
route to the PEG for a basketball game
only to find out that the other team has
neglected to show up.

If a team forfeits twice in a season in
one sport, it is kicked out of the league.
But apparently this is not working. “We
tried to institute a rule where if a team
forfeited two. say basketball games, it
couldn‘t have a team for softball. But
that isn‘t fair to those who want to play
only softball,” said Huff.

Another major gripe has been the
referees. “We have a workshop before
each season and they (the refs) are sup
posed to know the rules,” said Huff.
"We have two student assistants who
dliend some of the games to check to
riiake sure things are running
smoothly." he added “But there will
arways be a little complaining
whenever refs areinvolved,” Huff said.

Maintaining a fair malevfemale ratio
has become a problem this year, More
and more teams are having difficulty in

iinding the one iemale required ior foot-
hall and basketball. “It used to be
worse," Huff continued. “Last year we
tried to require an even number oi
males and iemales ior a oneday foot-
ball tournament. We only had two
teams," he said.

Whatever the reason, there is a
definite decline in overall participation.
Last year the "Superstars” competiv
tion had 25 participants. ”1 was excited
about this year's program because of
last year's success. But only one person

signed up," Huff stated,

Women express IM woes

by Katie ingwersen

1M sports at Grinnell were originally
created as a way for non-varsity
players to enjoy group sports. Now lMs
serve different purposes depending on
the people playing. Some people use
IMs as an arena for strong interdorm
competition while others use them as
an entertaining way to relax and put
less emphasis on the competitive
aspect. Despite this diversity in the way
people enjoy lMs, interest in them
seems to be declining, especially
among women.

Women's lack of participation is less
of a problem in sports like volleyball
and softball than in basketball and foot-
ball, according to Janet Scannell. She
felt that in these sports ”most women’s
lack of training and smaller size gives
them a disadvantage, thus many
women are reluctant to participate."
An allrwomen’s basketball team is be
ing formed to overcome this problem;
about 20 women have signed up so far.
According to Scannell. initiator of the
all»women’s team, “The women's team
was an effort to compensate for the pro
gram. We’ll see how it goes over.”

In football the teams are still sup-
posedly co—ed; no women's teams have
yet been formed. According to Anne
Bordonaro, IM coordinator for Main
Hall, very iew women participated in

the football games last fall, Bordonaro,
who played in a iew games, felt she was
“a novelty” but enjoyed the experience
and felt that more women should play.

Some women leel that they are being
discriminated against when playing,
however, Scannell feels that this
depends on the people and the reasons
they're playing. “If the team is very
competitive and they don’t know the
women (for example the Rawsoanates
team), the situation is different than in
a team in which men and women are
close friends," she said. Scannell thinks
that when teams become overly com-
petitive they are defeating the purpose
of having IMs. She felt that “com-
petiion is one thing and you can't
eliminate it but ‘intense’ sports should
be left to varsity (teamsi."

Besides competition, lack oi para
ticipatlon may be due to the students
lack oi time. Playing lM sperm is not a
high priority ior many people, accor-
ding to Scannell, She is interested in
suggestions for improving the IM pro
gram at Grinnell and is interested in
hearing what people want out oi lMs.
She acknowleged that “everyone gets
something different out of Hiem“ but
wants to learn “what the majority oi
the people would like."
