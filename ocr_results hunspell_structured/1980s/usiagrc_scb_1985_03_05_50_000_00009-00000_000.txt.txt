As Grinnell consciousness moves from
ilentinisni to peoplensm with the resurr
i-ection ot the Men's Group. let us now
‘praise a culture hero who helped make
‘all this possible. 1 refer to Alan Alda.
who. as the 'mmitable Hawkeye Pierce,
.wct the st r of the televrsion series
"Mu-AoS‘ll"
. i-lawkeye Pierce was more than a
character in a show. he perhaps chang-
‘ed the way men and women or our
generation think about each other more
than any other figure or our time. Durr
.ing his decade’s reign over the 4077th
Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, he was
'a prankster to his tentmate Frank, a
'trouble spot lor his commanding or
licers Henry Blake and Sherman Pot-
.ter. a thorn in the side ol ltlajor
Houlihan. and a father - confessor to litv
ltie Radar O'Reilly, He was a multir
iaceted character. someone we got to

now and like as a ”real" person
,despite his many flaws. He was snide,
concerned. skillful, flirtatious. but
always the guy in the white hat.

The compelling quality ol Hawkeye
Pierce's lrequent “lunacy" was that it
pas always in response to the insanity
oi war » a message which America was
ready to hear so soon alter Vietnam. He
struck out. not at people, butat raceless
bureaucrats who cared more about
their own prestige than the lives they
were supposed to save. A Robin Hood 01'

to present it to a Korean Child who was

the local orphanage. Enough for
Hawkeye the innocent. the voice oi
reason in the wilderness.

‘Grounds for Thought’

Ellen Weimtiock

Hawkeye also knew when to cry. The
death of his friend Trapper John didn't
leave him mouthing some platitude
about the difficulty of wars Hawkeye
went ahead and let the tears pour. The
acceptability at his tears was backed up
by Major Houlihan as a foil {or his open
sentimentalityi “Hotlips” Houlihan
showed the contrasting character trait -

getting drunk instead oi talking to
anyone about her tears, and being
afraid to let down her guard It is this
reversal of our stereotypes which made
Hawkeye stand out as the sensitive
character he was. He set a cultural
standard in whichvnice guys finished
first.

Women got crushes on Hawkeye
Pierce. and this was the catalyst for the
societal change. Unlike a Paul Newman
or even a John Travolta. Hawkeye was
an attractive character not tor the way
he looked (pleasant, but no pinrup guy)
or a talent he had (as his singing in the
shower proved), but for his general pet"
sonatity. No matter that he was suppos-
ed to be about thirty and was actually
around fifty at the endof the show. No
matter that he was supposed to be from
Crabapple Cove. Maine, but had a New
York accent. There was something
about him that went beyond that kind of
accurate detailing. This led women to
look for more ”sensitive" men. to find
vulnerability a desirable trait and thus
allow men to show their real feelings
more often.

To call Alan Alda the only reason for
this change in human relations would
be a gross overstatement. The changes
in how American men behave go way
beyond this. Nonetheless, Hawkeye
Pierce will remind us of a can»
sciousness which is fast disappearing -
the outlook which almost passed the
ERA. and which let us relax our gender
rules a little and get comfortable.

 

. For better or tor worse. tor richer or
poorer. in sickness and in health. 1 am a
liberal 'till death do me part.

or course. i am tree to terminate the
relationship with my current political
attitudes it my perspective changes and
i no longer can justiiy supporting what
i once held so dear. But my political at-
titudes should be strong enough to
withstand most threats and guide me in
making consistent. rational decisions.
A One of my political attitudes. that on
attirmative actionrtype programs, was
recently threatened, 1 was going to app-
ly tor a summer program that I thought
would be ideal for me and I was op»
timistic that 1 would be accepted.

when I read the section on eligibility
for the program, though. I found that I
do not meet certain requirements.
Namely. I am not black, Latino, Asian
or Native American.

it is easy to become angry at being
discriminated against and. because the
program is restricted to these minority
groups. it discriminates against me.
Recause oi various laws. though, my
anger can't change the tact that this
program, and hundreds or others like it,
is legal, ,

when a white male liberal like mysell
is able to cooly determine what is bcsl

for the general welfare. affirmative ac»
tion is easy to accept. Minorities in this
country do not have the opportunities
that whites have and affirmative action
is a simple and appropriate way of en
suring that minorities are accorded
these opportunities

But as I found out, the system doesn't
always ”seem" right.

‘Quoth the _'
Raymond’

Jeff Raymond

The entire campus was exposed to a
situation similar to mine last year when
the English department set out to rind
an tnstructor for the AlrorAmerican
Literature class.

instead of conSldering all candidates
solely on the basis of academic merit.
the college administration dectded that

only blacks would be considered for the
post. Amid cries of reverse discriminae
tion. illegality and academic com-
promise rrom those opposing the ad-
‘ministration, the search tor an instruc—
tor was hampered and iinally postpone
ed.

But the college’s position was right
then and it remains so. The faculty does
not have enough minority members and
reserving the AfrorAmeriean position
[or a black is a sensible way of
alleviating that problem.

Knowing what I do now about the bit-
ter irony that affirmative action pro-
grams can cause whites caught in the
middle. why don't I change my mind
about these programs? Because.
despite my personal loss. I still believe
that there is a problem out there that
jobs and programs reserved specilical-
ly for minorities address. ' ~

Not qualiiying tor a program because
of my skin color could be considered

- “unjust," but this injustice pales in

comparison to the advantages built into
the system ior white males.

And so. with a slightly bruised ego but
my political attitudes intact, I will ad-
just to my ofessional setbacli and
press on, Lire isn't always fair. but we
liberals can always keep trying.
