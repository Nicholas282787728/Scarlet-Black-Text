Correction

In me story printed last week entitled
”Duties redistributed in Carl's
absence” Barb Gaddis was attributed
with “supervising over present S.A,s
and other R.A.s." However, Gaddis is
actually responsible only for those
S.A,s in her dorms and no RA 5, The
Serf: regrets the error.

Scarlet and Black,
