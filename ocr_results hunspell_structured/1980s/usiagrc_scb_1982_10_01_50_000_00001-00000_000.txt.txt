Throughout various periods or U.S.
history many policy makers viewed com-
mercial relations between countries as
benelicial, not only in easing tensions betv
ween nations, but also as a way of improvs
ing domestic problems by creating
markets for U.S. goods.

Whether such ideas Still hold true today
was one of the many questions debated
during the three day conference on
U.S.-Soviet Agricultural Relations here at
Grinnell.

other topics discussed during the con»
ference included whether or not the Soviet
Union could reach a state of Self-
sufficiency in the future; should the U.S.
continue to produce surplus grain and the
general outlook for agricultural trade bet-
ween the United States and the Soviet
Union.

Highlighting the Grinnell conference
were Soviet official Victor Lishchenko,
economic specialist D, Gale Johnson and
Department oi Agriculture Associate Ad-
ministrator Leo V. Mayer. Columnist
Lauren Soth. iarmer Maynard Raiiety,
Prolssor Kenneth Grey, Iowa Savings
President John Chrystal, former Iowa
Farm Bureau President Dean Kleckner
and Proiessor Wayne Moyer were also on
hand to present theirviews during panel
discussions.

During the course of a year, the United
States and Soviet Union will produce close
to a third of the world's grain. The U.S.
now stands as the largest
grain exporter in the world and Russia is
the largest grain importer,

Lishchenko cited the Soviet Union‘s
climatic difficulties and efforts to increase
livestock production as two of the main
reasons for the Soviet need to import grain
today.

Although the Soviet Union has a Smaller
area with a climate comparable to the
Midwest, its total arable land is the same
as Canada and the U.S. combined, accorr
ding to Johnson. With such a poor climate
prevailing, the output or Soviet agriculture
has been low-estimated at to percent or

U.S. - Soviet grain trade encouraged
Policy improvement needed by both

years we have had two good crops where
you (U.S.) have had two bad crops," added
Lishchenko.

However, Johnson felt that the impact of
weather on Soviet grain is often exag-
gerated. Other problems also contribute.
Bureaucracy within the Russian system
tends to hurt Soviet efforts to improve food
output and “farmers are not given the op-
portunity to utilize their skills, knowledge
and capabilities to farm efficiently,"
argued Johnson. '

“The biggest problem oi Soviet
agriculture is that it exists within a
socialist economy. . Canada is very much
like the U.S.S.R.. but it has reached a level
of sell-sufficiency. Monopolies just do not
respond to change," Johnson explained.
As one example, Johnson felt that if Soviet
farmers were given the chance, they
would leave more land fallow, reducing
the strain on the soil.

Faulty price systems and lack of worker
initiative iound in a socialist society also
reduces lood production, according to
Johnson. Even though 40 percent of the en-
tire Soviet labor iorce is involved in the
food industry, compared to roughly 25 per-
cent in the U.S., an American worker pros
bably produces two times the amount oi
his Russian counterpart. Lishchenko
acknowledged this. but was quick to
point out that such intensity is perhaps not
always so good. “Why should we overr
produce? The comfort oi the worker is our
iirst aim. A worker must have more time
on himself than just work," he explained,

During the 1970s the Soviet Union decide
ed to place more priority on meat produc
tion. Following these same lines, the
Soviet Central Committee meeting in
Moscow set a goal to increase the per
capita intake of meat from the current so
kilos on 70 kilos in 1990. “Nobody is starve
ing in Russia, perhaps we even eat too
much, it is yust that we cannot always keep
up with demand, especially not
overnight.” mentioned Lishchenko.

million metric tons of corn each year, lowa
itseli out distances the Russian yield with
a crop or 40 million tons. The U.S. total is
somewhere close to 200 million tons. oi the
10 million produced in the Soviet Union,
seven million is used [or feed,

Even though grain production might be
low, the Soviets do produce very large
yields oi other harvested crops. Sugar
beets, sunﬂower seeds and cotton are a
few of the success Stories in the U.S.S.R.
Johnson points out that despite a small
reversal in output in recent years,
sunflower seed yields in the late 19605 were
a quarter above U.S. yields. Cotton shares
a high priority within the Soviet
agriculture and yields are much higher
than the Cotton produced in the Southern
skates of America.

Almost every participant in the ccn~
terence recognized the vast resources
available within the Soviet Union and thus
saw other related factors responsible for
the low yields. “We have the resources,

that of the United States. “In the last eight but we must work to utilize them for better

account (or much of the waste in output in
Russia.

Where the U.S. produces 200,000 trac—
tors, the Soviets can only produce 5,000.
Lishchenko recognized this unbalance and
praised the US, “l have to admit, your
John Deeres and international Harvesters
are better,” he added.

Lishchenko did say that a part of the
next Five Year Plan projected for 1990 will
show an increase in spending of 40 percent
to upgrade farm roads and transportation
and a 60 percent increase in the area of
storage. Ten million dollars has already
been put into improving drainage and ire
rigation.

Johnson indicated that almost 10 percent
of Soviet fertilizer production (nine million.
tons) is lost or wasted between the factory
and field. it that was solved, grain produc-
tion could “increase by nearly 10 million
tons."

Professor Grey linked the low amount of
money available {or investment as a pro
blem in Russia. Low prices coupled with
high wages does not leave the government
with sufficient marginal return. This in
turn affects agricultural investment and
the opportunity oi looking for other
resources. The U.S.SR. currently ape
propriates nearly 27 percent oi its budget
to agriculture. making growth rather exr
pensive, “The Russians need to look at
other resources in order to make proiit
more available for investment,” Grey add-
ed.

farmers Answers to whether or not the
Soviet Union could ever maintain efficiena
cy and selfrsulliciency will depend on
Russia's ability to overcome such builtain
problems. “A time comes when
agriculture needs to branch into new
organizations and enterprises,” argued
Grey.

One such enterprise would be for the
Soviets to change their current harvest
system on state collective farms to
harvesting by migratory combines similar
to what is done in the U.S.
Grey feels this would better use machinery
and man-Dower.

Lishchenko sees the coordination and
cooperation between the different bran-
ches of the food industry as one strong way
to improve efficiency and cut down waste
Regarding the outlook for iuture
Soviet-U.S. grain trade, the consensus of
the conierenoe participants was un-
favorable toward trade restrictions bet-
ween the two giants.

ln the eyes oi Lishchenko, the past will-
ingness of the U.S. to resort to trade em»
bargoes as a viable part of foreign policy
has forced the Soviets to change their
policies and look elsewhere for grain
trade. “Unfortunately the relationship in
the field is not very good. . (we are! force
ed to go to other markets such as Argenr
tina, Brazil and Thailand." he argued.

Throughout the past U.S.Soviet grain
trade has been characterized by easylng
and tightening oi tensions. Subsequently,

'careiully, Mayer thinks trade helps to

reduce the dangers or war, moderate
Soviet policies and encourage a sense of
independence within other eastern counv
tries. At the same time, he feels food we
ports should not be used as an instrument
or loreign policy. “U.S. restrictions only
harm ourselves. . . grain is available from
many other places.” he said.

Mayer feels that U.S. farmers, have still
not recovered from the grain embargo ima
posed two years ago by President Carter.
Seth opposes embargoes on the grounds
that “sanctions just do not work. It only
causes more antagonism.” Greg argued
that the U.S. should keep open all markets
such as machinery, technology, and iood
processing equipment. Scth agrees: “It's
good business for them, it’s good business
for us.”

Soviet official Victor Lishchenko talks
with Grinnell Associate Professor of
Political Scrence Robert Grey.

Grey also ielt that an embargo can be
symbolically effective in changing the
Soviet's View of the US, although there is
little or no economic affect. “With or
without an embargo, the Soviets are trying
to reduce their dependence on us and
others,” he concluded.

In Soth’s opinion, the US is currently
fulfilling the role ofa ‘residual' supplier of
grain to the U.S.Sﬂ. “The U.S. is simply
overproducing grain. We need to get pro-
duction in order and base our trade on our
best interesm."

Soth thinks better management would
help to save resources and higher the
prices to benefit farmers. Such action
would also spur other nations to stop relyr
ing on cheap American grain and perhaps
try and develop their own available
resources. Soth also questioned the smbilia
ty oi such policy which is too dependent on
one good market such as the Soviets.

Mayer summed up his own views oi
trade and at the same time seemed to
voice the opinion of the conierence on the
whole, "The exchange of information, an
increase in trust are valuable. , . we gain
much, much more than we ever lose
through trade.”
