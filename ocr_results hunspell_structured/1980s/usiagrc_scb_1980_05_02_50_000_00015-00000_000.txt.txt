Questioning
campus attitudes

To the editor: The standard llne used
by speakers at speakers corner in
London when a heckler calls the
speech rubbish is, “And you’re stan-
ding here taking it, which makes you
a rubbish collector.” Let’s keep this
bit of folk wisdom in mind as we con-
sider “Bullshit Assignments,” those
lovely topics that allow us to parrot .
back what the professor and text have
already said,

These multlple-Choice quizzes writ
ten in longhand seem to be on the rise
at Grinnell. Three years ago i heard
students talk about what they were
saying in a paper; now, it papers are
even mentioned, we talk about what
the professor wants us to say. I have
pointed this distinction out to people,
and have been assailed with a
fatalism I thought died out with the
czars. We are agreed that it is terri»
hle, maybe even an insult, tor a pro-
lessor to assign a paper that does little
more than ask if we have read the
book and come to class. We also find it
conveniently expedient; thinking for
ourselva is not only tiring, it's time
consuming. .

It's really a nice little arrangement.
students write what professors expect,
and professors don't have to bother
with me unexpected, Everyone
ﬁnishes in time to go running, and all
those things we Greek ideals like to
do. It’s strange that anyone should
complain, but many do, Our new
realism, however, tells us that
relevance, pluralism, and all those
misty notions don‘t get us into the best
business schools, So a couple at days
spent dreaming of the research that
might have been, a deep sigh, and we
write what we're told, Few have the
gumption to suggest an alternative
topic to the professor, and still fewer
write what they want regardless of the
professor's Wishes, These plunges into
freedom can easily fall into the
“blow- rot! school" paper writing, but
if we are that dumb, We deserve what
we get

We need to stop kidding ourselves
that we are compelled to write anemic
papers, Our iutures, for better or
worse, are not dependent upon a grade
on an occasional live-page paper. The
lie that goes, “Just give ’em what they
want, what difference does it make?"
Should also be laid to rest. This notion
encourages us to ”stand here and take
it." it is also a dangerous habit to pick
up; the stakes here are small, and the
environment more benign than almost
anywhere else.

“It you have raced with men on foot,
l And they have weaned you,

How will you compete with horses?

And It in a safe land you tall down,

now will you do in the jungle or the
Jordan?” ‘

Jeremiah 12:5

Rebel applauds editorial

To the editor: I applaud the ‘Anatomy
of a Mistake’ editorial in the April 25
issue. i have been personally involved
in several issues of the same type,
Remember the quiet hall hassle a few
years ago? Immovability of this kind
is present in student affairs, too. Some-
one ther'e once warned me not to '
petition one of the committees of that
office. I did anyway. The point is.
there is apparently enough lack of
‘intellectual courage’ for even ad-
visors to become resigned to the fact.

THAT‘S WRONG. Intellectual courage ‘
is one at the greatest things the col-
lege should promote. I warn you.

Don't ‘make waves’ with even the
slightest notion that it will never have -
an effect. The world deals harshly

with rebels, so they have to believe

that someday they will have helped to
initiate a change. Believe in what you
have done and why. Believe in
yourselves. Believe in change.—
Sincerely, Dennis Aalbers. A REBEL
