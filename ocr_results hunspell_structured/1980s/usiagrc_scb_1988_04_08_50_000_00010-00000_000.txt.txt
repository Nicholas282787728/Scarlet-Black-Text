The campus bookstore appears
to be playing a game which only
the students are privy to and
aware oi, as taculty members have
themselves, at limes. not been
aware oi ridiculous price changes.
Since students at Grinnell are re
quired to buy their books, tor the
most part, at the campus
bookstore. the ridiculousness of
this game becomes ever more apr
parent. It I were paying $220 and
receivmg $220 worth 01 books. i
would have no complaint. but this
is blatantly not the case, since
there exists no alternative to the
campus bookstore, with the excepr
tion oi those tortunate enough to
find required materials at the SGA
book sale. the present pricing
system must be changed. — tieorr

ping primaries” Those who vote
now are not the same people who
vote in November. in most cases

the primaries are (air represenla» ~

trons; however, sometimes they
aren’t. This is one such case.

Under normal circumstances,
the best solution tor the
Democratic party would be a
Dukakls-Gore ticket. it wouldn't. be
extremely strong, but the
Democrats who vote tor Bush will
be a much smaller group than
those who voted tor Reagan. The
problem is that it Jackson con-
tinues doing so well, a Dukakis-
Gore ticket might look like a racist
stopdackson maneuver and would
probably alienate the minority
vote which the Democrats need to
win, However. it Jackson is
nominated. as many it not more
people will be alienated. it is a no-
win ituation, It seems as it the nae
tion is headed tor four more years
under a Republican presidency.

If only the voters had listened to
what the candidates were saying
earlier and hadn‘t misunderstood
them. Eiden wasn't trying to hurt
anybody when he quoted Neil Kin-
nock in his speeches. Babbitt and
Simon shouldn't be blamed tor
showing honesty and integrity, two
oi the liner aspects oi the game.
And Gephardt wasn't trying to set
up barriers, he only wanted
America to be able to play ball.
