A lesson in school pride

Well, you‘re on a roll now, but the
counterrattack isn‘t prepared to give up
without a fight.

“0k, l'll give. you that Grinnell is old,
but Iowa has nothing more ar-
chitecturally interesting than a bunch
of corn and a few farm houses"

Now we've got them:

Mears Hall, which dates back to 1888,
and Goodnow Hall, 1384, are both listed
on the National Register of Historic
Places. That's two 19th century
buildings, still standing, on the same
campus, And that's not all,

The town's public library, Stewart
Library, built in 1901, is also listed on
the National Register of Historic
Places. One of the reasons that it has
earned a place on the list is the
building‘s unique style of architecture,
called “Romance Revival.”

That’s an easy one to counter.

The Poweshiek Bank building at the
corner of 4th and Broad. It was
designed by Louis Henri Sullivan, the
leader of the “Chicago School” of ar»
chitects during the late 13005 and is an
example of a "jewel-box" building

count ’em, 46 different kinds of beer
That's all at once, by the way, and a far
cry from the usual Choice of either Bud
in cans or lrom the tap.

It‘s tough to argue \vtth beer. so as
long as you have the enemy on the run
let’s hit them with some of the more
unique and trivial (acts.

You can always drop the old “Exr
perience" on them

According to the material issued by
the Ofﬁce of Admissions: ”The
‘Grinnell Experience' . . does not
merely mean a process of getting the
right answers, The ‘Experience’ lies in
acquiring a proper —ancl lifetime~
respect {or asking the right questions.”
Now who is going to light a school with
their own ”Experience?“
