Student involvement needed

. To the Editor: Rumors on this came
pus are traditionally spread by word of
mouth. However, it has Come to our at-
tentlon that the administration has
recently released an unsubstantiated
claim that Grinnell College athletes are
not representative of the .college’s
overall quality. We disagree,

We would also like to point out that a
temporary and minor emphasis on the
toothall program should in no way
damage the school's academic reputa-
tion. The damage this issue has created
is more immediate. Pol rization along
anti-“jock" and anti~ ireak” lines
signals a greater danger. As Missy
Bowen pointed out in Wednesday's
symposium. tolerance towards leel‘Sir
tv is an integral Dart 0i our “Grinnell
Experience." We must begin by accept»
ting the notion that Grinnell's academic
strictures apply to all oi us. And that.
beyond this, we have the right to choose
any part of the “Experience” which ins
terests us.

AS Grinnell enters the 1950’s, we
should recognize the current trends.
The student body has become startling-
ly preproiessional. It has also become
quite athletic. Si) what. Change of this
sort is common. The college must
evolve it it is to meet the needs of in
coming student, who naturally reilect
new developments in our society.

In the 1970's. these students have

become more introverted, more sell-
centered. since ms changes in college
policy have been met with Widespread
apathy. We have, in eiiect, handed the
policy making initiatiile back to the
iaculty and deans, Despite this trend. a
conscientious administration should
make some effort to involve the student
body.

On the other hand, we must make an
equal etiort to involve ourselves. The
success of the student voice in the late
1960‘s was a product or active, enduring
concern, The symposium Wednesday
night demonstrated a potential for this
concern to be rekindled. While it IS
unreasonable to expect continuous in
volvement, we do urge everyone to take
an ongoing interest in college pelletes

Where these policies relate to varsity
sports this interest is already present.
That over 75 athletes left their studies
to attend the symposium is indicative oi
an 'active' concern. That 50 percent at
the student body participates in inter
collegiate events is indicative oi an ‘enr
during' concern. This group needs to
participate in those decrswns which air
l'ect it. Our athletic teams are highly
representative of Grinnell's overall
standards. Let us hope that the
college's reputation ior open and sensi-
ble involvement can main equally
