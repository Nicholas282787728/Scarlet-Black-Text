New grading
policy approved

by Dave Jones

Starting with the fall semester of 1987.
Grinllell College will add 13+ and C+
grades to its grading system. This was
Voted into effect overwhelmingly at the
iaculty meeting on February 2

The reasoning behind adding the grades
according to the Committee on Academic
standing. which proposed it IS that the
new grades will permit grading to be more
discriminating at points where it seems to
be needed. “Also we thought that it would
make it possible for our students who are
seeking admission to graduate schools to
be more fairly treated," adds committee
member Howard Burkle.

The introduction ot the new grades,
which will bring Grinnell in line with many
of its peers. was well received by the faculr
ty, “It's taken us 25 years to get here and i
think it’s due time," commented Ken
Christiansen.

Student Government Association is
credited by many as bringing the issue of
the grading system to the faculty’s atten-
tion. By sponsoring a student referendum
last year, which recommended a change in
the college’s grading system, SGA was
able to make the grading system a priority
on the faculty's agenda.

Town women
address community
health care

by Jennifer Halcrow

Women’s health care, an issue invoivA
ing Hie entire female population of the
Grinnell area, is a current topic of debale
in the community.

The Central lowa Family Planning
Clinic in Marshalltown received United
Way funding from the city at Grinnell to
service the needs of the Grinnell communi- i
ty. Kathy Kamp. co-president oi the Grin-
nell chapter of the National Organization
of Women (NOW) said that her organiza-
tion conducted a study of the need for a
Central iowa Family Planning Clinic
satellite facility in Grinnell about 5 years
ago. Kamp said in the past the problem
with setting up a satellite clinic “seemed
to be a reluctance on the part of doctors
hererwe‘ve periodically iollowed up on the
issue with talks to the Marshalltown clinic
and doctors in the area."

In contrast to Kamp’s commitment to
the clinic issue Merrilyn Mohan, a
registered nurse at Grinnell Senior High
school said, ”We re pretty well coveredr
we ve got clinics in both Newton and
Marshalltown—if they‘ re uncomfortable
with their family doctor." In addition,
Mohan Said “Out of 650 kids ln grades 9 to
12 we deal with only about i or 2 pregnan-
cies (carried m term) in a year "

Mohan also stressed the educational pro-
grams offered to students in the high
School, such as a health class, the Contem-
porary Living class‘ and a class In child
development. The Contemporary Living
and child—development classes are elecA
tives for high- school students.

Katherine Sturtz is a home-economics
teacher in the high School who teaches the
Contemporary Living class. According to
Sturtz the school “has done some revision

volves some local doctors in the teaching
of classes. The classes now teach family
planning “encompassing those who don’t
believe in birth contra ," said Sturlzi

Kemp perceives a community-wide need
for a satellite clinic but encountered relucs
tance, especially from the medical com-
munity. According to Kamp, “It boils
down to competition....ramily planning is
Competing with local doctors" and “they
(at the Central Iowa Family Planning
clinic) don‘t have any money“ to set up an
office in Grinnelli

The Grinnell area hospital was con
sidered as a location for a satellite clinic,
according to Kamp. Kamp said that she's
“felt rather frustrated because it seemed
that the people in positions of power in the
hospital...at best give lip service” to the
idea, Another attitude described by Kamp

is the “feeling that Grinnell is too conser-
vative" for a facility like the Marshalltown
clinic.

Jane Davidson, iormer co-president oi
Women's Group. also supported Kamp’s
perception of a communitywide need (or
women’s health care that is “convenient,
adequate and inexpensive.” Davidson
discussed several difficulties encountered
by highschool students who must drive to
Marshalltown, Newton, or Des Moines for
inexpensive birth-control counseling.
“Think of a highschool student who has to
explain why they’re going to be gone, why
they have to have a car...it's Specially
hard in a small town...because people
know more about each other," said David—
son.

Apart from high school students. David»

Following his appearance here in Grinr
nell, i had me opportunity to interview
Mitch on his way back to Des Moincs. The
following is the text of that interview:

Question: Why do you think it takes people
so long to realize there is this problem (the -
homelessl and to take steps towards doing
something about it?

Answer: “Old habits and old stereotypes
and ignorance die slowly, but they do die. "

Q: Have you even had any inkling to turn
track. or had any second thoughts?

A: “No, why would I want to do that? That
would imply that there’s some value in tur-
ning back. It would be like asking someone
who's just come out of a swamp into a love-
ly, wonderful, beautiful area if they felt
