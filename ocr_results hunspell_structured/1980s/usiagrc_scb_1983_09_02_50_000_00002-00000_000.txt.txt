Clockwork LeHer Sparks SGA Debate

by M. Wolfgang Schumann

The first meeting of the Joint Board was
dominated Wednesday night by discussion
and debate over a controversial letter
received by SGA, that objected to the plan-
ned showing of A Clockwork Orange this
weekend. other business included appoint
ments to special committees, a brief
discussion of a lost parachute, and propos-
ed curriculum changes that would
substantially decrease students' choices in
planning their own programs of study.

The unsigned letter, attacked the Choice
that was made by the Film Committee on
the grounds that Clockwork Orange was
unnecessarily violent and that its content
overrode whatever artistic or political
value the movie has. While the Joint Board

. consensus was against cancelling the iilm,
opinions differed on exactly ’what action
should be taken,

S ecific debate centered on whether the
opi ons of the letter writer should be
published. Some suggested that copies oi
the Clockwork Letter be distributed
though campus mail to make sure that the

felt that publicaiton in the 5&3 would sure
lice. A iew members of Joint Board said
the choice should be leit entirely to the in-
dividual.

Mike Marcus, Younker Hall president,
said that Clockwork Orange undoubtedly
combined violence and humor in what
some may say is a distasteful manner. The
same could be said oi the James Bond For
Your Eyes Only that was shown just last
week. He commented that “the people who
wanted it came and the rest didn't. The
people in this school are intelligent enough
[to make their own choices when it comes
to moviesl,” Tad Brenner, Main Hall
president, said that those who aren't sure
about the level of violence in the movie can
read the review in ‘today's Scarlet and
Black and decide ahead oi time wheuier to
attend. Michael Oxman then discussed the
rape scene, one point of contention brought
iorward in the letter. “[It was] really
poweriul 7 i don’t think you can compare
it with James Bond.”

Dave Hoiiman, cochairman oi the Film
Committee, explained his reasons ior
choosing the iilm: “We chose the film

Drake Defends Liberal Arts ,'.

by Eric Lusk
and Matt Woods

The incoming freshman to Grinnell
would probably find little similarity bet-
ween this institution and those of Oxford or
Cambridge, However, in his convocation
address Thursday, President George
Drake emphasized the origins and legacies
that Grinnell inherited from these
venerable instituions.

The convocation, entitled “Here We
Stand”, centered around Drake's efforts to
convince the public that “a liberal-arts
education is, without apology, the best
education available.” The title “Here We
Stand" refers to theologian Martin
Luther’s words of conviction at the Diet of
Worms in the early 1500's. l-iere, Luther,
despite the pressures of leading
clergyman, refused to renounce his unor-
thodox beliefs

Like Luther of old, Drake sees Grinnell,
and other institutions like it, coming under
increasing pressure to defend its liberal-
arts heritage

The ultimate purpose of this liberalrarts
education as originated by the medieval
universities was to ”understand the world
around them”; a world they saw as orders
ly President Drake cited numerous exA
amples of ”frontier colleges” in early
American history such as Harvard,
Williams, Oberlin, and Grinnell that em-
phasized the Oxfordian mastery of basic
skills and subsequent applications oi these
skills in the real world, It is ﬂiese earliest
institutions, Drake said, that moved the
country forward in the first century.

Yet since the American Civil War,
Drake believes that a liberalsarts educa-
tion has-slipped irom- dominance, As the
demand for higher education has grown

and become increasingly specialized, the
public has become iairly impatient. “it
wants training, not classic education."

Drake then commented that as the
United states changes, Grinnell must
make appropriate changes to keep up with
the world while holding on to the value of a
classical education. In both an earlier in»
terview and the convocation, Drake sees
Grinnell as successful in doing this. “We
can adapt to the modern society without
undercutting liberal arts."

Drake points out that Grinnell was one of
the first institutions to embrace the com-
puter agc without letting it “chew us up
and digest us.” He also cited the changes
in residential living and the Sloan grants
as examples of modern adaptability
Drake also noted that the high enrollment
of urban Students has led to diversified ac
tivities of every nature However, Drake
did not View athletics as an area due to
modern adaptation. “We don't want to
adopt the “win at all cost" attitude”, but
he sees the value of competition ior the
students.

Drake did admit that more changes are
needed, He envisioned increased
developments and diversity in the school
curriculum, He also emphasized the need
for a much stronger program of teacher
education.

Ultimately, Drake pointed out that a
liberalrarls justification comes mainly
irom the alumni, who testify to the flex
ibility o[ “thought, communication, and
problem solving" that they employ in the
real world.

Grinnell, then, provides a traditional
and classical education. Society may re-
ject it unless it can adapt to society's
changing needs, To quote Luther and

Drake, “Here we stand,’God help us, we’

can do no other.”

because it’s an excellent film. No one can
doubt it's a classic. It is a violent film. . .
The statement it makes far exceeds the
violence. . , and it's not for the soft-
hearted. [But] it most certainly is worthy
of showing. It’s a unique film, AS far as i
know there is no film that has treated the
subject in this way.”

Debate ended and a compromise was
reached in a voice vote calling for copies of
the letter to be attached to the minutes
posted in the dorms by hall presidents.

Core Curriculum Resurrected

The Jomt Board also considered action
on a proposal to include more rigid re-
quirements in the Grinnell College Cur-
riculum, The requirements would require
students to take more courses in unrelated
fields.

The proposed curriculum changes, ac»
cording to a memorandum sent from Mar-
ris Parslow, Curriculum Coordinator,
would result in the imposition of 24 to 40
credit hours of courses that a student
would not normally select, thereby reduc
ing his choice of electives. For most
students, the imposition would probably

amount to fewer than 20 additional credit
hours. This means that the average Grin-
nell student, whose program has been vir-
tually requirement-free will have to take
about one more required course per year.

The new requirements would include one
course each in Levels I and II of the Sloan
program, eight credits in one science,
eight credits in one social science, eight
credits of Humanities, four credits in one
department of Fine Arts, and four credits
of NonsWestern Studies,

The curriculum changes will be con
sidered in October by a faculty committee,
which will vote on the proposal at two
separate meetings. The SGA tabled action
on the proposal.

In other business Wednesday night: The
Jomt Board discussed the establishment of
a typing room in Hurling Library Pro-
ceeds of $466 from the used furniture sale
and about $200 from the used book sale
were reported. The SGA’S shortrterm loan
program has just raised its interest rate
from one to three percent. The budget for
the all-campus Alice-in-Wonderland Party
was forwarded without discussion.

Faculty Gets Loans
to Buy Computers

by Jim Hunter

The college administration and Com-
puter Services currently are working out
the details of a system oi loans and disc
counts which will enable members of the
campus community to purchase
microcomputers on iavorablc terms. Ac-
cording to executive vicepresidcni Waldo
Walker the plan is part of the college's goal
of becoming, “the best small liberal arts
college in the area of computing."

The idea has two goals. First, the college
has entered into negotiations with Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC) to allow
members of the campus community to
purchase DEC microcomputers at a con
siderable discount, This discount program
will be available to students as well as
iaculty and staii members.

Second, the college will provide interest
free loans to iaculty and start members
who wish to purchase microcomputers.

Director at Computer Services, Newton
Munson, chose to pursue a discount ar~
rangement with DEC because they are the
manuiacturers oi Grinnell's existing coma
puter system, The DEC microcomputer
can serve as a terminal to the central com-
puter as well as tunctioning as an indepen-
dent desktop computer.

Both Munsoii and Walker expected that
there would be substantial interest in the
program Walker noted a large increase in
computer use among iaculty and students.
Munson noted that a number oi colleges
now require incoming students to pure

add that he did not expect this to be the
case at Grinnell, but likened the situation
to the increase in the use of calculators
over the last few years.

the manager and the Pub Board have to
accept responsibility tor bad management
decisions.”

But manager Rowe said, that poor
management in the past is to blame for the
current cash shortage.

Pub board member Kevin Crim said,
”nobody is to blame” and “market
conditions" have led to the Pub's losing

money.
