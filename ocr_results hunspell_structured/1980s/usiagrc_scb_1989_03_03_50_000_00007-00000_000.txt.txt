SCARLET AND BLACK

Reader blasts letter, Macho responds to

defends Overholser

To the editor.

This is just a quick letter to
express my surprise at the “letter
to the editor" regarding Ms.
Overholser as this year’s
commencement speaker. I do not
think that a few problems makes
a paper so utterly useless (or I
would quit reading the Scarlet and
Black), and I can‘t believe Betti
does, eilher. I would be the ﬁrst
to admit that the De: Maine;
Register is not the best paper in
the world, but I do think it is an
excellent paper. I also think that
some bad does not warrant the
condemnation Beth gives it (if
you think something
uninteresting or stupid. don’t read

- it!). I urge people to read the De:
Moiner Register and decide for
themselves: today, the opinion
page has articles by six syndir
rcated columnists, and three very
interesting editorials: on the
upcoming cityrcouncil selection;
a condemnation of Tower for not
asking that the FBI report be
released; a piece on censorship in
Great Britain. These are all
interesting pieces, and they are all
coherently written. Beth
basically calls Ms. Overholser
illiterate (“I hope Ms. Overholser
can get an AP writer to write her
commencement address for her.
instead of having to rely on her
staff writers"). This is

On Politics:

Last Thursday evening while
you were keeping the chairs warm
in Burling, twenty conscientious

‘hours at the Capitol in order to
wrap up the committee hearings on
John Tower‘s nomination for See-
relary of Defense. The vote went
suaightalong party lines: eleven to
the, Democrats overRepubl leans,

this two-vote partisan edge the

unwarranted (and also poorly
written). I have sent a copy of
this article to Ms. Overholser.
explaining that Beth is a staff
writer for our paper (hiding
behind, incidently, a "to the
editor"7l don't think the Wall
Street Journal, or even the De:
Maine: Register, allows their
staff writers [to] write letters to
the editor), who obviously
considers herself to be more
Ialentcd than Ms. Overholser. I
urge Beth to write a formal
apology. Writing for the
newspaper should teach you some
respect! Bruce Friedrich ‘91

EDITORS' NOTE - The S
and B does not employ
staff Writers like the Wall
Street Journal and Des
Maine: Register. It is
unreasonable to compare
an S and B contributor
with a paid staff writer at
a major newspaper.

Letters to the editor
provide a forum for indi-
vidual opinion. Regardless
of her status as a reporter,
we feel Beth Wodzinski
has the same right to ex-
press her opinion in a let-
ter as any other student.

anti-g raffiti letter

To the editor:

I am writing in response to
Bruce Nissen's letter condemning
the ”increased Volume of grafﬁti
on campus."

To begin with, there is plenty
of chalk graffiti on campus. most
notably the insipid “you are here"
as well as others advertising
bands or birthdays. By no means
is the gay-oriented “We Are
Everywhere" the only such use of
chalk. I have no idea why Mr.
Nissen sees this as a great offense
against the campus, since chalk
is not damaging and wears off;
why is paper, which is more
expensive and wasteful
(especially when tape and
photocopying is involved) so
acceptable while chalk is
“offensive"? Being more unusual
and noticeable, the chalk is also
more effective than paper signs,
since as Mr. Nisscn admits,
there is an abundance of paper
signs all over campus. And what
about the spray»painted “I'd rather
have a Mercedes" on the walk
between the Forum and ARI-l?
Since Mr. Nissen reserves all his
ammunition for the chalk “We
Are Everywhere" graffiti, I am

not its manner of presentation,
which he finds so offensive.

I find it puzzling that
someone who calls himself a
supponer of what he perceived to
be the message of the signs (gays
and lesbians are everywhere and
demand to be treated as equals)
spends his energy in unproductive
condemnation of the people
trying to get this message across.
Why didn’t you write a letter
condemning the death threats and
vandalism directed at students
trying to get this message across
(using paper signs, etc.) last year,
Mr. Nissen? If you are sincere
about being a supporter of this
struggle, there are far more
constructive ways to expend your
energy than deploring the use of
chalk in such a reactionary
manner. I‘m glad Mr. Nisscn
considers himself a supporter of
affectional equality and freedom, a
goal to which so many students
including myself have devoted so
much effort. But to be an
effective ally or supporter, you

must be supportive, not hostile
to whatever methods people use
to achieve this goal.

I am also disturbed by Mr.
Nissen‘s reactionary language.
Such a sentence as, “I am
insulted by the attitude that the
commonly accepted rulcs adhered
to by the vast majority of our
campus community do not apply
to these individuals" Sounds to
me like the voice of opression,
Mr. Nissen, not [on our allies or
supporters. The whole point of
our struggle is that there are niles
in our society (the
“overwhelming majority” of
which is heterosexual) which do
not fit us and are oppressive.
The chalk graffiti was a method
some students decided to use to
illustrate this point. I can only
conclude that Mr. Nissen has not
successfully confronted his
homophobia, and that this

triggered his letter last week.
Your support is more than
welcome, but I for one cannot
consider you a supporter on the
basis of last week‘s letter.

Student "ecstatic" after
Black History Month

To the editor.

As I stumble. less than most,
from party to party, I wonder
about the droning monotony of it
all!» Watching guys named
”Boozer" and “Browskie” wallow
in rcgurgitatcd barley and hops
can be quite disheartening to the
serious, conscientious student.
As is the case throughout the
Grinncli Experience, though.
there are many redeeming events.

The most important of such
events for a serious and
conscientious black student like
myself are the Black History
Month lectures and gatherings.
The past month has seen the
Civil Rights Symposium, the
film Brother From Another
Planet, and the talent Show, to
name a few. I cherished the
opportunity to experience that
which is familiar to my particular
culture: an opportunity all too
ubiquitous for the wider
community of Grinnell. My
enthusiasm for this month is
coupled with pride unbounded,

It is a wonderful thing to
have been able to feel, see, and be
myself in all the forms that a

predominately white institution
doesn’t often offer. This chance
awarded my culturally extended
family here, as well, a foothold
or grasp in an at times
overwhelmingly racially
dominated environment. We
have realized and rcaffinnod all
that we are!

Some of my pride has been
channeled toward the purely
historical aspect of this
nationally recognized month.
Recent improvements in Our
society at large and regressions
alike have been brought to the
fore. And herein lies the didactic
power of Black History Month;
for just as I am here to learn I am
here to instruct!

Some of the main goals of a
school like ours are the
extension, transformation, and
amelioration of the selves in each
of us. Most importantly.
though, is the maintenance of the
core self, and this is why I am
ecstatic about the past month: we
have aided in “Keeping The
Dream Alive"! Craig Jeffrey
