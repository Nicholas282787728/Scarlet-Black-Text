Gnnnell after Grinnell

The real world i

by Keri Scoltnn

In last week’s issue. I interview-
ed six facility members who had
graduated from Grinnell and then
came back to teach. This week. I
am considering six students who
either graduated or left school in
the last four years, but chose to re
main in the area.

Why did you leave school?

Three or the people under con»
sideration graduated last May.
and lor them. at least. graduation
should be explanation enough.

Over three years ago. Ed
McGuire left Grinnell College
alter completing his lreshman
year, McGuire said he did poorly
in classes that year and was “not
prepared tor the academic
pressure, Independent. poor at
time management, and not self-
motlvilted is how McGuire
described himself, After not being
pushed academically in high
school, McGuire said that college
was such a different environment
that I found a great deal of trouble
coping with it.”

Steve Berkson left ill the middle

ol his sophomore year almost two ,

yeals ago. According to Berkson.
school was “not taking me wherei
wanted to go," He said he lelt that
it was ”time to apply some or the
things I had become. belol‘e
graduation." Bcl'kson does not
regret, lhe year and a hall that he
spent iii college and speaks ot his
last semester in his best one "1
didn‘t leave because of the struc’
ture. but because of “here I
wanted to go... If the means at

. school is taking you to an end that
you don‘t want then you really
shouldn‘t be here "

Unlike Berksoll and McGulre.
Nikki Carlson did not leave school
by her own choice. According to
Carlson. she had to drop her
classes about three weeks ir'o this
semester because her l-eoerally
Guaranteed Student Loan fell
ﬂ’lrough. Without the loan she was
not able to afford the tuition.
What are you doing now:’

Although he ended his role as a
student at the college three years
ago. McGuire remains a part oi
the college working for Grinnell
College Computer Services,
McGuire remarked. “I didn’t
leave the shelter of Grinnell which
supposedly separates students
from the real world,”

McGuire said he feels very fora
tunate in having the opportunity
of working for computer services.
when he first left school. McGuire
did not have any definite plans.
Because oi his problems in
academics during the year before.
McGuire said the people who
hired him “look a chance on
me,..that choice was both a
benefit for me and the college."

For his first year he held the
part-time job or Weekend
Operator, To this was added the
job ol Temporary programmer
which he held until last June when
he moved to his current position
as Systems Coordinator.

Working proiessionally enabled
McGuire to acquire the skills he
had lacked to perform well
academically. According to
McGuire. having “to pay the
rent” and avoid “an empty
stomach” is a good source of
motivation.

Berkson has been working for
the past six months at Wolverine
Technologies. a factory that
makes window parts. When
Berkson left school at the beginnr
ing oi 1933, he and Marc Lambert
were already operating 5 and M’s
Pizza out of The Bar. S and Ms
closed a few months later after a
dispute with the landlord of The
Bar. Berkson spent the following

. summer as a carpenter and house. . .

ainter. Last fall‘hebegan work-

ing for Wenco making wood win-
dows. A few months later. though.
he was laid off and remained
unemployed until being hired lor
his current job. He sold bagels on
campus in the meantime.
Carlson is working at the
Mayflower Nursing Home as a
nurse's aide. Although she is
working full-time. Carlson said
she does not feel satisfied that she
is “contributing to society." Ac-

cording to Carlson. as a student
"it's made so clear here What the
point is." She said she now feels
“really out of it" and despite C0"-
tinuing to do some reading and
writing on her own. she does not
feel she is "quite ready to be in»
dependently studying."

Bob Stanis. like McGuire, is also
a former Grinnell student who is
now working ior computer serr
vices. Stanis was hired in the mid-
dle of the summer after
graduating last May. He did not
apply for the job until alter being
home for a month when he saw an
advertisement for it in The
Chicago Tribune. The opening had
been advertised last spring when
Stanis was still a student. but he
said he was “too caught up" to
consider it then.

Stannis‘s roommate. John
Egan. also graduated last May.
Egan is currently working at the
lront desk oi the Holiday Inn on
1-80 at the Amana Colonies exit.

Thais Dorland is working at the
same factory that Berkson is. She
is also spending her time pursuing
projects thatshe did not have time
for before she graduated last
May, Dorland is, for example.
now spending more time on her
art. She recently had an exhiblt in
the Negative Space Gallery of the
Forum.

Why did you decide to stay or
come black to Grillllell'.‘

For McGuire. the decision was
not hard to make since he had
been living in Grinnell lor over
live years belore going to college

Berkson said that ii |t were not
lor his initial business venture in s
and Ms, he problably would not
have stayed in Grinnell.

Since then Berkson has spent a
lot of time in Grinnell. “I’ve only

been out or Grinnell thre'e‘weveks -

 

in the last three years, said
Berkson. He has also moved
”eight or nine times" within the
town. Now Berkson is moving to a
larni ouEide of Grinnell. because
he says. he “loves people. but
wants to get away."

Stanis returned to Grinnell
because his job offered more than
an entryrlevel position in coma

puting. Stanis said that it is likely
that only cntryrlevel positions
have been available to him other
wise, According to Stanis. many
students have to accept entry»
level positions alter leaving Grin-
nell and are disappointed because
most ”Grinnell grads are more
ambitiou We're pretty picky
when it comes to the Job market."

Egan said he never thought that
he would return to Grinnell when
he left last summer His initial
plan was to find a job in hotel
management in his hometown oi
Boston. His job search last sumr
mer. mough, made it evident that
previous experience was re-
quired, Egan thought Iowa would
be a good place to gain that ex-
perience. since many of» his
friends and relatives were
already living here.

Egan did not immediately
return to Grinnell. however. He
went to stay with a iriend in
Waterloo, and spent the first part
ol September traveling around the
state job hunting. When he was
hired to work at the Amana Holi-
day lrln. Egan chose to live in
Grinnell despite the 50 mile com-
mute. because of his social cone
tacts here and the low costs of live
ing in Grinnell.

Dorland did not think that she
would return to Grinnell either.

She had planned to move to
Seattle from South Dakota but her
plans were indefinite enough that
she decided to stay in Grinnell if
she could find a job while on her
way to South Dakota from Florida
last summer. A few days later she
was working making window
parts.

According to Dorland. “the
pieces fell into place." She does
see her stay in Grinnell as lasting
muchmore than_a year. Dorland

said- thatjoutlook separates her -

is just two blocks away

lrom many or her coworkers

because it enables her to see her .

factory job ‘finite'.

What changes have occurred in
terms or your social life alter
leaving or graduating lrom the
college?

McGuire tries to have a balance
oi both college and town in his
social liie.

Despite leaving school. Berkson

is still a iamiliar lace on campus.
in fact he said he feels “more a
part of the place now _than
before.” it his friends treat him
any diiierenlly because he is not a
student. he said that is due “more
by a change in me than by a
change in what I'm domg...What
changes occurred would have
happened anyway. My interests
aren’t quite the same anymore."

Carlson said she has a hard time
interacting with people on campus
now. Because of this she
sometimes feels more comfor»
table with people she knows in
town. Carlson explained that she
ieels upset because many
students are asking her. “Why are
you here"H Carlson said. “ll/lost
people assume I'm not in school
because the pressure got to be too
much." In her View. most
students here expect to have
enough money or aid to go to Grin-
nell. “whereas for me it’s a lux-
ury."

Stanis and Egan live together in
a house across from Brown House
on Park Street, Egan described
his position as “the best of both
worlds” in that he can play both
sides of the street. the college and
the town.

Stanis said that “on the whole
there are not great differences” in
his social life now as compared to
when he was a student. Since he
works from eight to five. he is free
at night when his friends are slur
dying.

Dorland said she feels that she
is now less involved with the cam-
pus. She said that at the end of
August “having the college come
back in session was just like an in-
vasion.”

- According to Dorland, she often

feels that her student friends can-
not relate to some of her working
world concerns. For example. she
is frustrated by the fact that her
input is not wanted at work.
Dorland said she often has to “bite
her tongue" in terms of doing her
job. “They’re assigning you
paychecks and that‘s what it's
about now and it’s different than
it's ever been before."

What are your luture plans?

McGuire is thinking about
returning to school in the next few
years. He said he misses the
academic work and wants to
”broaden my mind.” As for his
career. he does not know if he will
stay with computers. He is con-
sidering other interests such as
musxc. but is not sure if he could
make a living at this.

Berkson said he may remain in
Grinnell for a lew more years. but
not for the rest of his life. He said
that he would like to start a
restaurant again and also become
a fireman He Sald he looks upon
|hB latter as “one of the most
benevolent occupations" because
you “simply go out and save peoV
ple's lives.” Bcl‘kson said his
parents look upon this as a ”dead
end Job.” Bel‘ksoll points out that

to Berkson. is so he \Hll not have
to go into debt to pay lor his
education and will "not have to
depend upon my degree [or Inn

that economic concern leads
many students here to “hording

Carlson thinks she will leave
Grinnell before November. She
Said she feels restless here and
remarked that it is a “terrible
thing being here and not being a
student." Carlson believes that
she is stagnating in Grinnell and
added, “If i put mysell in a new
place. maybe I'll get a little
motivated about something.”

According to Carlson. she will
probably go to Seattle because she
has some friends there and it is an
area of the country that she would
like to live in. She said she is not
sure what she will do there.
although she is interested in doing
social work with children. She
said she wants to return to col
lege. but probably not to Grinnell.
and probably not until next fall.
Carlson was just starting her
sophomore year when she was
forced to leave.

Egan plans on staying in the ,
area for at least two more years.
He is in a manager training pro-
gram where he works and hopes
this will lead to a promotion in a
few months.

Like McGuire. Stanis does not
know if he will stay with Come
puters either. in a lew years. he
may decide to go on to graduate
school to do further studies in
psychology.

Dorland graduated with a B.A.
in religious Studies. She is con-
sidering gomg to graduate school
in a lew years to earn a Master of
Fine Arts,

Dorland said she does not think
she would be happy in Grinnell on
a longvterl'n basis. but for now
“it's o,k. to sit back and not have a
purpOse for tomorrow.”
