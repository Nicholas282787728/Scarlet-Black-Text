Scarlet and Black

Costa Rican Silhouettes

by Todd Francis

The train iinally pulls up, We
struggle with our backpacks 7
each stuffed full at a semester’s
worth oi supplies 7 and try to
elbow our way onto the train, Our
seats are on car 2. We soon
discover that the first car after the
engine is car 6, the second car 4,
and the third, at last. is Car 2,
There we stuff our backpacks onto
the luggage racks and settle down
for the 307h0ur ride to Guadaiae
Jara. >

My seat is on the aisle. Beside
me a woman is already seated, She
Wears a pink sweater and looks in
her 305. maybe. She smiles politely
at me and nods. Her eyes are hidr
den by lenses tinted pink surround-
ed by translucent brown irames.

I sit down. She asks me slowly
where I'm from. I tell her. She's
lrom Mexico City. A secretary.

i haven't had a lengthy conver-
sation in Spanish withanyone since
. ve arrived in Mexico. so I don't
know how well I'll be able to
understand other people's Spanish
or if I’ll be able effectively to com-
municate my own ideas with
anyone.

But she is speaking slowly
enough. that the dialogue is work-
ing She tells me that she makes
about to dollars per day 7 a lot in
Mexico, she adds, as the average

{laborer makes about $2 50.

She tells me that she has travels
ed quite a bit, and i get the feeling
that that is unusual for Mexicans.
She Visited a friend in Scotland the
previous spring, and had recently
been in the States.

I Wonder what her marital status
is, but I don't ask directly. I talk to
her about how much she liked the

{"States, about our trip through Can»
tral America, about different
places in Mexico, She tells me that
the States was nice, except that she
couldn’t talk with many people
because she didn‘t speak English

The hours roll by and we Con-
tinue to talk on and off, I take out a
friendship bracelet I’m working
on. I notice her watching What I'm
doing, and I teach her how to make
one.

When night comes, there is an
empty double seat nearby. i go
sleep there, so we each have more
space. About every hour during the
night a conductor comes along and
checks our tickets, so our sleep IS
choppy.

The next day we continue to talk
She tells me about how liberated
Mexican Women are becoming -— it
used to be they couldn't go into
bars, rarely tried to raise kids on
their own, saw divorce as too
sacrileglous ever to undergo. Now
these things are more com-
monplace, she says.

Somehow I learn her name is
Tina, She buys three tamales at a
stop in a small town and shares
them with me. They‘re dry and

Her thoughts on liberation con-
tinue. She describes how women
should have more power over their
lives 7 too often their iathers rule
them until they get married at 18
or 19. then their husbands take cons
trol.

A couple times the train stops ior
unexpected delays, The iirst time
we hear a rumor that a train is
derailed ahead oi us on the tracks.
Later we ieel a bump, and when we
stop, someone tells us that we ran
over a cow. It takes several hours
each time.

She tells me that she has been
married and is now divorced. Her
iriend in Scotland is an Argentine
man named Pablo whom she lived
with from last April until
December He. too. was divorced
and had two children.

Pablo and gone away only three
days before,

The second night is approaching.
Due to the delays, it will be tomor-
row morning when we arrive in

sunset over the Facilic Ocean, then
i begin to write in my journal. Tina
asks ii she can use a piece or paper
to write a letter to Vinci, a friend of
hers and of Pablo's who lives in
Tempe,

After she has Written it, she asks
me to translate it because Vinci's
best language is English As i
begin, the trains electricity sud~
deniy goes out and we stop again.
When we begin to move again. the
lights are still not working, so I
take out a flashlight and she holds
it {or me as I write.

Clothing Drive
Benefits Homeless

by Debbie Goltschalk and Karen
Lehman

Next Thursday, May 5, students
Helping the Homeless will be
holding a clothing drive to beneiit
the Kindred Community and Se-
cond Mile Items will be collected
in the Forum lobby from 11 am
until in p.m. lithe weather is nice,
we will be outside the Grill during
the day. The Kindred Community
operates two free shelters in Des
Motnes that are run almost entire-
ly on contributions which grow
scarce in the summer months, Se-
cond Mile is an organization in
Grinnell that operates a free
clothing closet ior people
throughout Poweshiek County.

Both Kindred and Second Mile
Iieed summer clothing. In addition.
Second Mile needs household goods
like plates. cups, silverware. and
appliances, Kindred could also use
cleaning supplies, diapers, sheets.
silverware. toilet paper. toiletries,
towels, ions, and men's work
shoes. boots, and clothing. Kindred
needs monetary donations for vehi-
cle maintenance. cleaning supr
plies, utilities. home repairs. pro
perty taxes. and‘ mortgage
payments.

The Des Memes Register
reported Wedenesday, kpril 27.
that city oiiiclals are going to fine
Kindred $100 and seek a court
order iorcing the group to make
repairs. Over the past year, at
least 40 students have gone to Des
Moines to help Kindred make
repairs and have witnessed the
tremendous progress that has been
made. They can also attest to the
liveableness of the Conditions they
saw in the article, city Attorney
lvan Webber is quoted as saying,
"The city has a responsibility to
see that people, even the very
poorest, receive minimum
service." Ironically. Kindred and
the Catholic Worker House provide
free shelter and iood, and the city
does not. According to community
member Mark Rogness. Kindred
needs 312.000 to finish repairs. Last
semester, the iloor cans that were

collected raised almost $100, We’d
like to ask iloors to donate their
can money again in an effort to aid
Kindred with this stretch oi
repairs.
