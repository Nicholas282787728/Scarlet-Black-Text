Because our curriculum is deter
mined primarily by the faculty,
any opportunity we have to influ-
ence the curriculum is valttable
and challenging. As the student
representative to the curriculum
committee and the chairperson of
the Student Council on Curricu-
lum, the SGA VICCV .' '
president serves as a
crucial and influential
link. In order for our ’
perspectives to be in
eluded, the VP must
be persistent and able
to articulate the con
cems of students in a
clear and concise
manner. The job re
quires excellent inter-
personal skills, In
addition to addressing
issues relating to the
curriculum, the VP
acts as the prosecutor tot \l’lcludlr
cial Council. To successfully lul»
fill this obligation the VP must be
able to represent the interestof the
studentbodywilhoutcompromise.

SGA is not the only avenue for
developing leadership skills at
Grinnell. Through on- and off
campus experiencesl have gained
skills necessary to be an excellent
VP. My primary involvements
this semester are as minorityrreA

cniitment assistant in the admis-

sions office anti as one of litrec

students who serve oti the CSC

Advisory Board. This is my seer

ond year as both a student atlviser

Students are f unher represented
on SGA by a body called the Joint
Board. Joint Board consists ol’23
senators elected from studentderms
and houses. The senators are re—
sponsible for representing student
opinion to the Cabinet, informing
constituents of SGA activities,
approving all SGA by-laws, and

sentloint Board on various college
committees. JointBoard meetings
are held every Wednesday night at
7:30 p.m. Any Grinnell student is
permitted to attend and speak at

term Board meetings; however,
only senators may vote on the is-
sues brought before the board. '
