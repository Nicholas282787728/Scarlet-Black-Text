Norms Ushers 1n Christmas

by Karin Sedestrom

I wandered over to Norris to check out
the Christmas atmosphere and oh yes. to
ask my stock question in this series. “So.
what's it like to live in this dorm?”

It was Monday night and the computer
room was lull; people were working.
pretending to work or just trying to
distract people who WERE working.

Rob Pollack was in there working on a
paper. as he usua‘lly is these days ~ they
are considering naming the room “The
Pollack Memorial Terminal Room'ﬂ simp-
ly because the man lives in there. He sug~
gested to Tom Wickersham that l be told

ris.

"Which is . . 7" [asked

He got on "I'm a philosopher but not
really” look on his lace and told me "Nor-
I‘IS is not attached to a loggia. therelore it
is in a world of its own. it has its own class

" Back to reality. “It's a very t’reshmanr
populated dorm. The social atmosphere is
great."

“Tum. there's a nasty rumor going

around that you want to be an SA in Norris
next year. Is this true?”

“Yes. It IS true."

“Why Norris?"

“Because I‘d like to help lreshmen get
adjusted. and Norris is full of them." Ah. a
noble plan. Thanks. Tom and Rob. .

i haven't yet lound a Christmas present -
that captures all oi my impressions ol Lon-

Probably such a thing doesn't exist.

I will have to resort to London Transport

But I give these out with the understanding
that they are only a small token of London.

The only way to lind out what London is
about. of course. ls to go there. something I
heartily recommend. Alter all. you will
have the rest at your lile to have a
telephone and to take long. hot showers.

View is nice. the rooms are nice. It's never

”How would you describe the people in
Norris?"

“Everyone is anxious to meet everyone
and get involved. On my lloor. they match

We lucked out. We do a lot together."

“What about Christmas in Norris?”

“We‘re having a lloor competition lor

Christmas tree decorating party
Everyone's in the Christmas spirit."

There is a construction paper lireplace
on the wall with stockings bearing
