is now thinking about coming back for
good.

Farmer was born in 1928, in Council
Bluiis, lowa. His father, a guitar
player, encouraged him to choose an
instrument, and Art picked violin and
piano. Later, in high school, he took
the only marching band instrument
available to him: the sousaphone.

"when I became interested in jazz, I
wanted something that was easier to
move around with. so I made the
logical switch to trumpet,” he says,

sparked his initial reaction to jazz. His
tirst real contact with the genre came
when he heard the Jimmy Lunceiord
Orchestra. “The way those guys were
able to play so precisely and cohesive-
ly impressed me tremendously,” he
recalls. “I lelt 1 just had to be a part
o1 a band like Luncelord's. "

Farmer went to Los Angeles when
he was 16, and served his appren-
ticeship with Horace Henderson,
Floyd Ray, and Johnny Otis. It was
during that period (1945-46) that he
first heard the giants oi improvlsa-
Lion—Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie,
Miles Davis. That was the clincher:
determined to learn enough about
music to make it his life, Farmer went
to New York, where he joined the Jay
McShann Orchestra in 1948. He returnr
ed to Los Angeles the following year,

with musicians like Benny Carter,
