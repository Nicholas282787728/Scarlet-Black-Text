Graffiti-

no apparent
rhyme or reason

There seems to be some silly sort of war being waged between
students and the powers that be at the library

Since the completion of the library renovations, the library staff has
understandably tried to discourage the writing of graffiti on the
bathroom walls of Burling.

Graffiti which might once have been termed humorous or even
enlightening has over the years degenerated to the point of being all too
often inane and banal, usually obscene and frequently malicious.

Some students argue that the scribblings at Burling deserve to be
sanctioned since they constitute some sort of profound art form or
poetic expression. But the presence of even the most profound
statements can easily be corrupted when placed next to such gems as a
list entitled “the ten biggest assholes on campus.”

If the only appropriate place for a remark is on the wall of a toilet
stall, chances are the comment is better left unsaid.

Other students argue that Burling graffiti is a Grinnell tradition and
as such deserves the proper amount of reverence and respect. But if the
graffiti in question has proven itself to be essentially disrespectful,
perhaps it should be viewed accordingly

Plain, freshly painted walls are not an invitation to scrawl, and the
logic behind the overwhelming impulse to do so seems nonexistent or
unreasonable at best. Indeed, vandalism in general cannot be accepted,

and vandalism which may be hurtful to members of the college com—

munity should not be condoned,

All-campus parties
A case of overkill?

Tomorrow night is the date of yet another all-campus party.

With almost every dorm on campus trying to get into the act, the
calendar has become cluttered, and the events have lost much of their

appeal and significance

The James Hall Bacchanal, the Loose Hall Ball, the Main Event, the
Read»Cleveland joint party i . . the list seems endless. What ever hap—
pened to the days when the Loose Hall Ball, the James party and Relays

were more than sufficient?

Then the once a semester events were looked forward to and enjoyed
by most of the students, serving as a fine sort of all-campus tension

release

Now the parties have lost much of their charm and seem little more
than an excuse for a bunch of costumed people (many of whom cannot
get into the Pub) to crowd into Darby and drink warm beer, One might
think that when planning an activity, a dorm could have the imagina-

tion to come up with more than just another all-campus party.

l have heard many well thought-out
criticisms of the silent protest of Marine
recruiters in the Forum last week. Being
one of its instigators, i listened careiully.
Now I would like to summarize the
arguments against the protest, and at-
tempt to defend my actions.

First, critics feel sorry for the officers
who had to endure the silent condemnar
tion. Second, ﬂiey think the recruiters and
recruitees have a right to talk, free from
the pressure of a protest. Young men
should be able to choose a military career
without being hassled. Finally, they con-
tend that the Marines have very little to do
with nuclear war, The protest, whose aim
(for me) was to demonstrate my deep
disapproval ot the military tor its
wastefulness and its role in the arms race,
did nothing practical to alleviate these pro»
blems. The protest was not wellatargeted;
on the contrary, critics claim that it was
useless and maybe harmful.

The first two criticisms are very impor
tant, as they concern human feelings. i
made an effort after the protest to talk to
an officer and explain we had nothing
against him personally; our message was
a disapproval of the military in general.
Yet, inevitably, demonstrations rouse feel-
ings ot hurt and anger, because at the
heart of a demonstration is the questioning
and rejection of values that someone holds
,dear. One must ask whether inconvenien-
ce and hurt feelings are too great a price to
pay to make a point.

That brings me to defense of the third
criticism, that the demonstration was
useless or impractical. It was mainly in-

-spired by strong opposition to nuclear

weapons and the increasing willingness to
use them. There’s no need to explain the
dangers ofnuclear war here 7 let it suffice
to say that i am more worried about the
extinction of the northern hemisphere than
I am a world-wide communist totalitarian
state. Were our country to endure fascist
tortures for so years, it would not be worse
than total and permanent devastation of
the continent. What I want to explain ins
stead is the casual connection between our
puny little demonstration and the process
of world disarmament.

When does an ideal become a reality?
Hardly ever, except in movies. The Marine
recruit protest was the outgrowth of a
pacifist ideal. Idealists believe mat their
ideals have an impact upon die culture.
For proof, look at the “American Dreanif”
Many people share it, few achieve it. and it
succeeds in reviving up the growth

economy, Another example is the ideal .
romantic love, neither a universal nor ,
changeless concept, which shapes mal-
female relations and the institution of ma

riage. Pacifism is an ideal with the‘potei
tial to change cultures, i believ
Demonstrations of the pacifistic ideal suc
as our protest should have repercussion
on the culture at large.

More concrete than these abstrac
“repercussions,” ideals have a way -
shaping peoples' lives and works so the
concepts are embodied in material thing
The concepts of thrift and hard work stan
out in the neat, wellcared-tor arrang
ment of a small family farm. Ar
literature and even science reflect th
person doing them, and as a result, his o
her ideals. Convictions can be inco
porated into everyday life — one need it
be a high level “policymaker" to make
difference. Nuclear disarmament will n-
occur at the international bargainin
table, as many believe, but in response to
transformation of Western and SDVl
cultures. The axiom “Think globally 7 a
locally” gives us the link we need to effe-
such a transformation.

The Marine recruiter protest was a loc.
action based on a global problem. It was
catalyst for many conversations about th
arms race and the nature of protest. It 5-
people on their heads for a moment an
made them consider that strange, ungai
ly concept, pacifism. Perhaps it wasn't th
most logical, direct, pefect way to make
point, but who cares? Disarmament is to
urgent an issue for us to sit around an
wait tor just exactly the right symbolis
the right place and moment, to make on
point, It’s very difficult to be logica
emotive, dramatic, in good taste, releva
and idealistic all at the same time. Thos
who agree with the motives but disdain th
activity are worried about etiquette, th
color of the poster and not what's on it.

The responsibility for the nuclear arm
race lies in history, national attitudes a
both sides about security, the selfrservin
bureaucracy of the armed forces, (yes i
cluding the Marines)‘and our own unwi
ting cooperation with the military i
dustrial complex. There‘s nothing we ca
do about the history of conflict betwen th
superpowers — that problem is bequeat
ed to us. But we can get off the path to a d.
it-yourself extinction by resisting th
forces which heighten Conflict. This mean
seizing every reasonable opportunity to b
ing an ideal into reality. That is why 1 Sa
