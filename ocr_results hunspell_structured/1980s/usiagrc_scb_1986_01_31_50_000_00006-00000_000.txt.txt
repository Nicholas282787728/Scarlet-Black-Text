chnlaker.

Sometimes marriages seem more like ’
business deals. The family of the groom

otten demands a large dowry

“The custom started out as a way ior
daughters (who legally could inherit
nothing) to get something from the
family," Valdya said “But it can really be
abused. You read in the papers about
families demanding 10,000 dollars to allow
the marriage."

This makes matters especially hard as
everyone is expected to get married,
“There is no position in society tor a single
person, especially girls.”

Thus, despite the problems, the tradi-
tions are lirmly rooted into society,

“If you told them. ‘You have to choose
[or yourseli,‘ they lost!“ Vaidya said,

In contrast to the trends in the other
countries, the traditional marriage
customs have become stronger in Iran.

”Fifty years ago. everything was ar~
ranged. Six or seven years ago, it was like
,ln the West, dating. etc." Amjadi recalled.
“NOW after the revolution, males can’t
even be seen in public with their sisters
[without problems].

“They’ll come up. and ask la couple] if
she's his sister of ii they're married or else
they’ll take them to the local police to in-
vestigate,“

One tradition that existed even
throughout the most “Western" period
before the revolution is polygamy.

“Our prophet Mohammad showed that
one could have more than one Wife and be
Iair to each,” Amjadi explained. “But
there are complaints, There is no way real-
ly to check it someone is being fair.”

Finally, when the panelists were asked it
they thought America's “freedom" and
choices in‘relationships would work in
their own countries, they all responded
negatively, They said this “freedom" is
not exactly what Americans like to think.

AS Nicole Hamlin, International Student
Advisor summed it up. “When I first came
here, everyone told me, ‘You can do
anything you want. There are no rules.‘
But here [in America] the rules are un~
written. [In France] I grew up with a thou
sand rules. but at least I knew what was
expected.”
