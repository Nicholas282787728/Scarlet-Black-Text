to be much more complex and
interesting.”

liis continuing interest led to a ten-
month return to the community in 1973 to
carry out dissertation research. And he
has been working “more or less constantly
on Amana ever since.”

His extensive studies have now dealt
with “nearly all aspects oi the community,
from religion and politics to demography,
economics, and folklore."

Currently he is in the early stages of
writing a book on Amana, which he hopes
to complete during his next sabbatical.
The book is to encompass the total Amana
community.

According to Andelson, the Amana Col-
onies were founded in 1855 as a “Communi-

ty of True Inspiration ,, Though the,

religion is based on Lutheramsm. the peo-
ple believe mat God spoke to the communi»
ty through various members of the sect
throughout much of its existence.

However, Andelson said that no living
links exist today, and the community must
rely on the recorded documents oi past
communications, in addition to the Bible,
tor inspiration.

Furthermore, members of die Colonies
have maintained lifestyles very similar to
those that existed 130 years ago, though
modernization has taken its toll at times, It
is these stresses on the culture mat par-
ticularly interests Andelson.

After conclusion of his present research.
Andelson says he will be “looking for new
fields to graze in.” Additional research on
religious communities is certainly a
possibility, for he cites studies of Mexican
Mormons and Costa Rican Quakers as ten
tatlve ideas in his continuing conveyance
or anthropology’s message.

article published for his doctorate study on
the Navajo in New Mexico, and cos
authored/researched an article published
in the Kansas Law Review in 1967, The lat-
ter project dealt with rural poverty and
was the product of the cooperative efforts
of Kurtz, an economics professor, and two
majors from the anthropology and
economics departments.

Currently he is researching a tourist
village in the Swiss Alps, examining the at
fects of tourism on the community’s
culture and Values. The idea for this
ethnographic fieldwork came from his ex
perience living in a tourist town before do-
ing his graduate study. It was an idea, too,
from the 1970s when tourism became a na
tionally popular area for research.

A comparative study of the effects of
tourism on cultures, combining Kurtz‘s
ﬁeldwork and Professor Andelson's cur-
rent iield study on the Amanas, has been
proposed as a future project.

In the future, Kurtz says he would like to
see, mough not be directly involved in, an
ethnographic licld school set up by the col-
lege in which five students would research
a community, each student examining a
different aspect of the society

Commenting on the department, Kurtz
feels that anthropology as a separate
discipline has become a vital department
at Grinnell and a strength in the general
education of the college. He also feels that
the way in which the department has in
volved its professors in other disciplines,
such as me humanities, American Studies,
and the Freshman Tutorial, has made an-
thropology an integral part of a liberal arts
education.

discovered illustrates the thought pro-
cesses involved in anthropology.

“Not only are the subcultures different
[based on artifacts and archeological re-
mains] but even the corn they grew was
different . . [which] suggests linkages
between the people were breaking down.
One variation could be a lay-product of
isolation .. As a culture begins to mature,
there is some breakdown ln communica-
tion with people outside the group and the
variation begins to occur," Luebben exs
olalned.

Luebhen is also working on an en
thographic problem, “Freud and Modern
Vienna." His thesis asserts Freud was
“essentially an astute sociologist and ,an-
thropologist” who looked at the cultural
traits as an anthro-sociologist would and
then summed it all up in psychological
observations.

Current Viennese behavior patterns lend
support to this viewpoint, he said. For ex»
ample, the oral concepts of Freud are very
much present in the Viennese’s “strange
fascination with the mouth."

“They’re always puckering their mouths
or sucking their teeth. They pick their
teeth in public with a toothpick but conceal
the movement with their other hand,”
Luebben elaborated.

As Luebben's research clearly shows,
anthropology cannot be easily pigeon-
holed into any one niche.

WHITE BLENDEDWINES .

In many ways, the white blends represent the mperlmental
nature of American wine making at its very best. Usually, these
wines are blends of several vintages (harvest years) and two or
more grape varieties. In most case, no one grape predominates.
Consequently, the white blends are produced in many styles from
full bodied and dry to light and sweet. When skillfully blended,
these wines offer exceptional value at very low prices. Enjoy
white blends with traditional wine foods such as fish or fowlt Sam-
ple a different blended white wine each day from April 8 through
April 12 free of charge, and remember, all American whlte blend-
ed wines will be on sale during White Blend week at the Main
Street Wine Cellar.
