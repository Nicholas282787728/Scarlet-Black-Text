From the world of committees,
Films Committee reported that
they had selected the movies ior
Relays. They will be “House of
Wax,” “Catch~22." “Yellow Suh-
marine," and on Friday night a
bunch of cartoon features.

Concerts Committee reported
that there would be an outdoor con-
cert Saturday night during Relays.
Also, the Billy Bragg concert
scheduled ior May 4 had to be
canceled due to administration
contusion over the speaking time
for a Roseniield lecture.

The Dining Committee reported
that a suggestion to have juice at
every meal would mean either giv-
ing up some other popular expen»
slve item, such as cheese, or an ins
crease in board,

Student Publications and Radio
Committee, in a letter to all the
senators, explained their decision
to shut down KDiC ior one week,
The individuals involved in the in-
sulting broadcasts have been per-
manently suspended, but it was
ielt necessary to demonstrate iur-
ther SP and Rs displeasure with
the persons involved, Also. some
media supervisory positions are
open. Anyone interested in them
should write to box 1143.

'Finally, the long-awaited major
topic oi discussion. the proposed
constitutional changes. came up.

The ﬁrst topic was whether the

emergency clause should be invok-
ed. This would allow SGA to use the
changes for one semester until the
campus could vote on them. Aiter
20 minutes, it was decided that the
changes should be passed in Joint
Board on a two~thirds vote and
then be approved tor notl by the
campus. Appointments under the
new system would be made but
would not take permanent eiiect
until the changes are ratified by
the campus,

With that argument out of the
way, debate settled down onto the
proposed changes. They were that
the Social Coordinator‘s job would
be split into two parts. One person,
the Social Coordinator, would sit
on Films and Concerts Committees
as a non-voting member, and on
ACE Committee. Her or his major
responsibility would be keeping
track of finances oi all the commit~
tees and making sure calendar
events did not conﬂict. Also, she or
he would advise the Films and Con-
certs Chairs On selection of com-
mittee members and handle the
booking for all films and concerts
with the help of the committee
chairs. A major amount of time
was spent on whether this person
had too much power (an amend
ment was discussed that stripped
the Social Coordinator of her or his
voting status on Films and Cons

certs Committees). A question was
asked as to whether a student.
could adequately handle booking
responsibilities. Evans responded
by saying'many student groups
elsewhere do their own booking,
and that Kevin Taylor, who does
booking {or the University of Iowa.
is willing to help train the coor-
dinator. The position was eventual»
ly approved.

The second position was that oi
the Alerampus Events Program-
mer, which passed with little
discussion.

Another change would restrict
the power of the Films Chair. This
person would just run meetings
and coordinate booking with the
Socxal Coordinator. Several objec-
tions were made that movies could
not be booked very iar in advance
and that this added layer of
removal deprived the Films Chair
oi too much power and gave it to
the Social Coordinator and SGA.
Also, the argument was made that
Films and Concerts Chairpersons
could run their own budgets very
well, However, the new description
oi the job passed,

Objections were also raised as to
the new structure of the Films
Committee. It will now have five
students at large. as well as the
chairperson, one senator, and the
Social Coordinator. I! will decide
on all movies by a majority vote.
Some said that it would make it
harder to get movies other than
entertainment ones. The new

structure passed. _
It was determined that the Con- ,

certs Chair would help the Social

Coordinator with the bookings. The i
Concerts Chair would also be‘

responsible ior securing a crew to
help with Concerts. The new job
responsibility passed, The Con-
certs committee proposol was
amended to make it only an ad
visory body. it then passed, too.

The new Alerampus Events
Committee was given complete
control oi the Social Activities
Fund. it was quickly passed, The
changes allowed Finance Commit
tee to absorb the initiative Fund
Committee in order to centralize
the disbursement oi non-party,
nonrpolitically oriented money. it
would also control the Student Fro»
gramming Fund. The new Commit
tee was passed.

The major change to the
Political Activities Support Fund
was that the Assistant Treasurer
would he made a member. Also,
semester budgets for groups could
no longer be iunded. This proposal
quickly passed. Finally, we were
free to stagger home.
