bridge? If we don't care enough to
say anything nou how dedicated
will we be ’n the .uture when pitch-
ed battles a being fought?

Part or the problem is that con-
servatives won‘t come out of the
closet. They can hear people's
minds snapping shut as soon as
they voice their belieis. People do
not treat them with the respect and
dignity that they, as human beings,
deserve. Who can blame them for
not coming out? Is “The Closing of
the Grinnellian Mind” merely a
chapter out of Alan Bloom's
(aforementionei‘l book? It's too
bad for the conservatives: if they
came mil 'l Mit find lots of
juicy “liberal’ st‘uep who can't
support thel“ ti_ilels.'Yum, yum.

'ine real ,rooiein is that people,
in order to be cool and ' liberal”
(read as nominally tolerant and
value-relative), must surrender
their right to have opinions,
Nobody rocks the boat .. it's not
cool to have beliefs which conflict
with those oi the crowd. Anyone
with differing beliefs can be
thrown into a box with a stereotype
branded on her or his forehead
(eg. “conservative," “sextst,'
”fascist.” “stiff." “Cro-Magnon,’
“Reaganite,” “Bible-thumpcr."
“GodSquader’Ui We don‘t dare
bring our beliefs to light, thus we
get no criticism of them and get no
chance to refine them, Neither do
we listen conscientiously to the opi-
nions or others. The result is foggy
morality, shaky beliets, and vague
values.

Folks don’t understand why this
is a big deal for me. I’ll summarize
brietly: Why do l think
something's wrong? Because
“liberals" are using stereotypes
and are hypocritically closing their
minds to the ideas of others. What
am I afraid of? Intellectual im-
potence spawned in a pool where
heated discussion is dying. What
are the consequences? A group oi
so-called liberal thinkers will go
out into the world with a weakly
supported set or helieis and
become disenchanted and cynical.
The fuzzy border between
“Everyone is OK; let people do
their own thing" and “That‘s just
the way life is" will he rubbed out,
leaving them out in the world with
no objection to the status quo,
What’s wrong with the status qua?
You’re the “liberal," you tell me.

is relegated to family members.

Even ii not in the same house,
relatives usually live in proximity
to each other. Costa Ricans are
surprised to hear that American
families can be scattered from
coast to coast and only see each
other once a year. During a week,
relatives here will visit each other
several times. These visits are
social, but they can also serve as
moral and financial support. If
possible, relatives try to help each
other by sharing resources and
services, such as sewing ior each
other or giving each other gifts of
tresh produce.

As time passes, we are becoming
more accustomed to family life
and Customs in Costa Rica. Even
the kissing greeting has become
more acceptable and natural.

“Second line
together! Ball in!”

Scrum by scrum, the Grinnell
women ruggcrs made it through
their second and third games of the
season last Saturday in lowa City.
Even though this is the women’s
rugby club‘s iirst year, the ruggers
showed tremendous promise as
they battled it out with the older,
more experienced lowa City and
Madison teams.

The team has been practicing
since January, working on learn-
ing the game, getting a tough
scrum together, and training the
halihacks. The practice paid all,
and Grinnell fielded a spectacular
scrum, including Melissa McLean,
.iane stanius, Justine Uselding,
Beth Painter, Amy Knox, Amy
Sherff. Emily Shea, Nicole [anna-
tuoni, and Mary Beth Diener, Said
Lara Pugleill‘l, “They pushed us,
but we could push right back. Now,
where’s the party?”
