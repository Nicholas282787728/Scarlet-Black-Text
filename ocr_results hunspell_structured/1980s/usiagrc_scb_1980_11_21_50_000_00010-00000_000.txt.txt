Facing the New Right

You may not be aware oi it, but Mon~
day afternoon in the Coffeehouse in the
Forum, a baby was born. Conceived in
the mind of Barry Krost and fostered

ith the aid oi Wes Kennedy, the child

ooks promising, It hasn't a name yet,
ut with effort, hopefully it will grow in-
a full-fledged adult. The infant is a
oalition of various campus groups, in»
luding AJS, GCGC, CBS, DSOC,
_ .Women's Group, and Citizens Party,
mong others. Although it hopes to deal
with many issues in the future, right
ow its first concern is reaction to the
cw Right which is blossoming in the
ountry.

Since the recent election, the “Moral
Majority" and its growing power have

on brought to our attention. Most of
us at Grinnell realize that we do not
support this New Right, but that is

_ here our knowledge on the matter
'ends. Certainly, we know its stance on
some issues — the ERA, abortion, and
gay rights — but we do not know who or
what composes it, how it is using its
power, or how great that power is. Un-
fortunately, that ignorance places us
just where the proponents oi the New
Right want us. And even more unfor-
tunately, that is where most or the us.
also stands.
» The New Right is a coalition of
organizations, all of which reach dill

’ ferent publics. it includes the National
Right to Work Committee, the
American Conservative Union, Com»
mittee for the Survival of a Free Con-
gress, National Conservative Political
Action Committee, Conservative
Caucus, The John Birch Society, and
several omers. It mass of such leaders
as, Richard Viguerie, Joseph Coors (of
the beer cm), Jerry Falwell, Phyllis
Schlaily, and several Us, Represen-
tatives and Senators. This gives us
some idea of its potential power.
Richard Viguerie, the organizational

genius, has a powerful toy. It is a com-
puter containing a mailing lislof known
conservatives, or even lespecially‘ll
single-issue conservatives, totalling 20
million, all broken down into 200 lists
ior separate appeals. What, these
millions of people receive in the mail is
answers — simple, straighforward,
emotionally appealing answers m to all
the country's complex, confusing, emo-
tionally disturbing problems. As they
embrace the answers, they are backed
into a corner 7 the Right corner 7 by
being told that ii they are good Chris
tians, or if they want the U.S. to be
strong, or if they don‘t want to cause the
downfall of the American family,
they'd best vote against such and such a
liberal and support this member or the
“Moral Majority." And when one
reaches 20 million people, especially 20
million known sympathizers, and gives
them easy, concrete choices, chances
are some will respond. And they do,
They vote; they give money; and the
New Right gains volume and momen-
turn.

The Moral Majority is against busing,
unions, ERA, abortion, welfare, gay
rights, gun control, and SALT II. It is
for tax cuts in the upper income

'brackew, a stronger military, more

nuclear power, deregulation oi
business, capital punishment, and
prayer in public schools. If you see
some contradictions there, you are not
imagining things. They are there. But it
doesn’t seem to faze the Moral Majori»
ty. And neither does the [act that they
are combining church and state 7 both
by pollticizing religion and making
politics religious (if only when and
where it suits their purposes). Their
power is hitting frighteningly close to
home. The lowa ERA didn't pass, in
part due to propaganda stating such
claims as that it would legalize
homosexual marriages. And what of

ihe Grassley Victory‘! Grassiey is allied
with the New Right, and Culver was one
of its targets, They are swii'tly gaining
ground.

Certainly, we would like to recapture
that ground. But how can we do il'.’ now
can we combat such a coordinated net
work oi largescale organizations?
They meet regularly and exchange in-
formation They have numerous in-
iluoncial people working in a full-time
eiiort, We do not have a group of power
ful Left groups, and we do not have sim-
ple answers, But, as i see it. and as
Barry and Wes saw it, our task is to
make the people less vulnerable to New
Right tactics. They can accomplish
nothing without the people's support.
To make people less susceptible to New
Rightvward sway, they iirst have to be
made less ignorant at it. They have to
see that Jerry Falwell's "answers" do
not answer, and not only that, but they
are often contradictory to one another,
Then we can try to offer them a Viable
alternative, though surely not in New
Right-brand simplicity. oi course,
there is still a problem, We cannot
educate others if we are ignorant.
Therefore, we must begin small. Our
first step is to educate ourselves. to in
iorm the Grinnell campus community
oi what, exactly, has been going on, in
the hope that it will be scared, m,
terested, and motivated enough to want
to do something about it,

This education is not as difficult as it
may seem. First on our agenda is an
open iorum in South Lounge, which will
take place the first week of December.
We will tell you what we know about the
problem, how it affects us and you, and
what we hope to do about it. Your
presence and input is invned and
desired. Next, we have at our disposal
newspapers. magazines, interested
proiessors. and active Grinnell
clergyman, We can start a reserve file
in the library for easy access to written
material, and we can schedule syni»
posia. After that, we would like to com»
munlcate with other college and univer-
sity campuses and national organiza-
tions and exchange information with
them. We could bring in speakers on the
subject and eventually involve the town
oi Grinnell in our exploration Like the
New Right machine, we are made up at
diverse groups With diiierent interests.
Although we do not wish to turn our
"rebuttal" into Simple, single-issue ap-
peals as they have done. we can utilize
uiis diversity to reach diiferent publics
and to make sure that all important
areas gel attacked.

one thing is certain; we have lo begin
soon. Every day, the "Moral" Majority
becomes a larger one, As we stand still
and ignore it, the New Right machine
turns somersaults around us and con-
tinues on its merry way. And with each
turn. it ensnares more Americans in its
net,
