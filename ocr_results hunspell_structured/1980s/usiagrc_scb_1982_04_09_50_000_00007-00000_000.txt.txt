Reaction to charges guarded until completion of trial

by left Raymond

Charges were filed in a leoeral come
plaint last Saturday against Kirby
Criswell, lormerly oi Grinnell. Criswell, a
defensive end with the St Louis Cardinals,
is charged with conspiracy to manufacture
and distribute amphetamines. No details
of the case have been given to the media so
tar and as a result there is a good deal oi
uncertainty surrounding the affair,

Because the case has not gone to trial
and details are not yet available, reaction
both in St. Louis and Grinnell is guarded.
Few people are willing to make statements
on the matter. Ray Boyd, vice principal at
Grinnell High School and Crlswell's
lormer football coach, said that most or

the people in town are not reacting to the
news of Criswell‘s arrest with much
alarm. “People are just waiting tor the
outcome of the trial.” said Boyd. “There's
not enough information yet " When asked
for his personal reaction to the news, Boyd
oliered a “no comment."

The Cardinals have similarly chosen not
to make any Oil'lcial statements, A
spokesperson for the club said that the
Cardinals will have to follow the events
arising from the case before taking any ac
tion concerning Criswell's status with the
team, She added that local fan and media
reaction to the news was not considerable.

The defense and hitting lunk strong, but
the pitching is a question mark as the Grin~
nell women's soitball team prepares for
the 1982 season. Ed Dombrowski, who has
assumed the coaching assignment this sp-
ring, has seven returning letter winners on
his squad. “The hitting looks potent and
I've been very impressed with our
fielding,” said Dombrowski. “If our pits
chers get the ball across the plant, the
defense will get the job done and we should
have a successful season.”

Grinnell was scheduled to open its
season Saturday (April 3) with home
games against lndian Hills-Ottumwa and
Cornell. But an early morning blizzard
forced postponement oi the games. They
will be made up at a date to be determined
later.

cludes four games with Monmouth, the
delending Midwest Conference champion
and a like number of contests with always
strong Cue But, Martinek is optimistic
alter his Pioneers “pitched, hit and fielded
well“ during their spring trip .to Ranger,
Tx.. last week, “Our strengths appear to
be in a senior pitching stalt, a good delense

and a lot of speed," Martinek stated. ”We
lack power hitting, so we will try to get a
lot of men on base and pressure the other
team's defense with our speed ”
