Both Erickson and Jim Tederman. Dean

area is "really important." Erickson said.
as "there will be the opportunity tor lnfor»
mal as well as formal Contact" between
the two related offices. The Forum is the
ideal location because it provides a sort of
"neutral ground," Erickson called it. as a
res'ul't'bf'lts centred-campus location.

Tedcrman Is looking forward to bemg on
central campus. as it will give students the
opportunity to have more irequent contact

"Students tend to save up all their pro-
blems and then hit lMacy. Fell and

Chair Still Unfilled

Noun Search

Committee

encounters hiring

difficulties

I)_\’ John Harrison

Aiter bringing iour candidates to came
pus over the last few months. the Louise
Noun Chair in Women's Studies remains
unfilled and now conflicts have arisen over
the methods used for hiring Grinnell's first
women's studies professor

Four candidates were brought to came
pus tor a series oi interviews and public
lectures over the last six weeks and at the
end of the entire process for each oi the
candidates, the student search committee
recommended Lillian Robinson. a pro-
iessor at Albright College who is aiiiliated
with the Stanford University Center for
Women's Studies to fill the Louise Noun

.chalr in Women's Studies, The faculty

search committee also recommended
Robinson tor the chair. yet had some
reservations on her teaching and ad-
ministrative abilities. But the Executive
Committee. who has the deciding vote in
all matters or faculty hiring, rejected
Robinson for the Noun Chair, Though it is
unclear exactly why the Executive Com-
mittee rejected Robinson. it appears that
many on the Executive Committee were
not satisfied with Robinson's public lec-
ture and personal interviews A person
very close to the hiring process said that
Robinson gave a poor interview to the Ex
ecutive Committee.

Since Lillian Robinson has now been re
jected along with the other three can-
didates for the Noun Chair. the Noun Chair
search committee has invited two more
candidates to campus to interview tor the
women's studies chair.

Arising irom the Noun Chair search pro-
cess has come new questions as to the ex
act duties and expectiuns of Grinnell's first
women studies professor, it is stated in the
job description that the Noun Chair in
women‘s studies is to teach a women's
studies course and is also to oversee the
establishment of the entire women's
studies program at Grinnell College. One
committee member said. "What we're
looking tor is two diiierent types oi people.

a proiessor and an administrator,"
Responding to this dilemma. Ashley Smith
asked. "Why not get two people to till the
Noun Chair?" Yet since the trustees are in
control of the Louise Noun Chair money.
the question at hiring multiple persons tor
the Noun Chair is in the trustees. hands.

The amount of money involved in the
Noun Chair is another sticking point in the
hiring process. ior this is the tirst time
Grinnell has ever filled an endowed chair
from outside the College. One committee
member explained the great diiiiculty pro-
iessors have in hiring a person who will
earn a higher salary than they earn.

The hiring process is even more pro-
blematic because of the expected tenure
for the Noun Chair, Since the college is
searching for senior professors in women‘s
studies. who have tenure at their home
schools. the college is almost forced to of-
ier tenure or a very- early tenure review to
the hired Candldate, One committee
member said that the immediate prospect
of tenure creates added pressure to the
Noun Chair hiring process.

An even further diiiicuity in hiring a
women‘s studies proiessor is that women
studies is something very new and not a
part of traditional mainstream academia.
As a result of women's studies rather new
and sometimes revolutionary implica-
tions. many persons on the search commit-
tee have very different ideas of what en-
tails a quality women's studies proiessor,

With a week left in the semester. time is
running short for the Noun Chair search
committee. With most of the faculty
members of the Search committee not eXr
pected to be on campus next semester and
many oi the students on the committee
graduating. one committee member was
prompted to say. "the position must be [ill-
ed this semester or the whole process will
have to start all over again." Yet. hope
was expressed by a iew oi the committee
members that the Noun Chair in Women's
Studies will be filled by the end of the
academic year.
