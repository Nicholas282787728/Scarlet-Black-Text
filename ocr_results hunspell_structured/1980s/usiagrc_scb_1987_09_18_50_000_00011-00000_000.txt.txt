As fall break draws near, so
does the start of another rugby
season. But don‘t head over to
mill Avenue ﬁeld this Sunday
when Grinnell takes on Newton,
because the Grifﬁns will not be
there. Grinnell's matches will
now be held on the practice foot.
ball field. You might ask your-
self why the rugby matches are
being held on a field in such poor
condition and so badiy suited to
rugby (i.e., the lack of distino
tion between football and rugby
lines). I asked myself that some
question.

In the past, tlieJugby CLUB
has always shared 10th Avenue
ﬁeld with the women's soccer
CLUB. Practices and matches
were arranged so one CLUB‘s
activities would not interfere
with the other’s. I personally
thought it worked out quite well.
But this year it is different:
the women's soccer CLUE is
low the women's soccer TEAM.
Congratusations! The advan-
tages of being 3 TEAM at Grin-
nell College are many. oiie ben-
eﬁt is getting your own field
for practices and games. And
by being 3 TEAM. the Women's
soccer TEAM is “entitled" to
their ﬁeld. However, it seems to
me the rugby CLUB should also
be “entitled" to a ﬁeld.

Yet, we do have a field for
our matches: the practice foot.
ball field. Yes, that wonderful
ﬁeld which is about as hard as
my cement driveway back home.
But why should the iield con.
ditions surprise me? After all.
it is used ﬁve times a week by
our football TEAM. I suppose i
could put on a helmet and shoul-
der pads, maybe even some knee
and elbow pads for our match
this Sunday. Then I might be
less prone to injuries, wouldn't
it But then again, that is not
possible, as it is illegal to wear
helmets and shoulder pads in
rugby.

It seems odd that a Grinnell
CLUB should have to settle for a
secondrclass field when there are
better and more suitable fields
on campus. The rugby CLUB
puts in a lot of time and effort
making their CLUB the best it
can be. We practice three times
a week on the 1M ﬁeld; we have
u “malmger” and captains just
likeany TEAM, and each mem
ber pays no in dues per season.
Yet, all Grinnell college can ofr
fer us for our matches (which I
ruight add, are well attended) is
a scrub field which the football
TEAM practices on.

have many of my friends.
wish them the best of luck this
Sunday as they begin their {all
season. But wait, they don't
have a match this Sunday. 50
why is it that 10th Avenue ﬁeld
will go Ilnused7 Simple: if the
rugby CLUB uses it, we will ruin
it. We will rip up the grass
during our scrumdowns and we
will trample the ground and
each other during our rucks and
mauls. Yes, we will destroy it
just as we have destroyed it in
past years (cough, cough]. The
women soccer players will not
want to practice or play on it
anymore, just as in past years
(cough, cough).

a few matches each season are
going to put 10th Avenue held
out of commission After all,
mth Avenue field has held up
quite well over the years, hosting
soccer and rugby practices and
matches for both the fall and the
spring. As far as i know, this
ﬁeld has never been prohibited
from use due to overuse. 1 al-
ways thought athletic tiekls were
meant to host a wide variety of
sporting events and thus were
expected to take a beating.

Maybe someday the rugby

. CLUB will be the rugby TEAM.
and then we too will have the
opportunity to enjoy the fruits
which Grillnell College proudly
otters its TEAM sports.

Grinnell college is the only
school ranked in U.S. News and
World Report that is hosting a
soccer tournament on Palents’
Weekend. As opposed to foot—
ball, soccer has no tradition of
tailgating. The last tailgate
party held before a soccer match
occurred in Belgium a few years
ago. Those partyers have been
indicted for manslaughter. soc.

college wants to project, As op—

parents who need to stretch

It's a shame my parents couldn’t
