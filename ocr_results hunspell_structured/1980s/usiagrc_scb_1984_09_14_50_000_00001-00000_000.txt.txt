Academic prowess much
withstanding, Grinnell College

However, this time it is not the
purveyor oi porn. "Playboy", but
“Rolling Static". which has tap»

Grinnell is mentioned on pages
46 and 56 oi the Sept. 27 issue as
part of a feature entitléd “College

Actually. Grinnell probably got
more “pub" when “Playboy" my

rather quickly.

The first reference comes in a
section called “Mondo Granola,”

the 1931 best seller. “The Official

another possible handbook,

The Granola campuses are
described as the last bastions of
sartorial eccentricity. Most 6X7

says.

However. in their pursuit oi the
dollar, she adds. many oi the
schools' administrations em»
phasize that the term "radical"

tempt to cater to a more aiiluent
conservative clientele

Ian McClean characterized this
election year using the words or
Walter Mondale: "There are two
different visions of America's
future” hinging on the outcome oi
the 1984 elections.

Apparently, this is a critical eler
ction year nationally as well as
on the state level. Republicans
and Democrats are responding to
this political season wiui voter
registration drives and by
scheduling candidates to speak on
platiorm issues,

Although the campus
Republicans and Democrats both
stress voter registration. the par-
ties are concerned with dillerent
races.

Campus Republicans are
primarily interested in
disseminating information on
issues and races on the national
level, whereas the Campus
Democrats are more concerned
with the lawn congressional and
senatorial races,

Campus Republicans began
gearing up their 1984 campaign at
their first meeting Tuesday.
September 11. Ten of the fifteen
students who showed were
underclassmen and five more
were committed but were unable
to attend, Ian McClean, head of
the Campus Republicans remark-
ed that this Is a decided improve-
ment irom his iirst year when one
ly three showed for the first
meeting,

McLean further remarked that
there is a lot oi excitement among
the Republican freshmen. “For
most of them. lhis is their first
taste otorganlzed party politics."
he said.

The thrust oi the Republican ei-
Iort will be directed at voter
registration, McLean believes
that these drives will produce
more independents who are wills
mg to vote conservatively, The

plaint may be iiled at any time of

agreed upon a curfew of 10 pm,

Ahrens said that any complaints
made before this time will be igv
bored. They must act upon come

plaints made aiter this time
though. or else his force could be
reported to the state There is also
a $100 iine ior noncompliance.

Ahrens hopes to decrease the
number of [hens made on cam-
pus, especially bike thelts. Actors
ding to Ahrens. the police are not
allowed to apprehend a bike thici
unless the bike is in the thief's
hands.

This rule prevented them from
catching two men the other day.
Ahrens and another officer were
watching two men hacksaw a bike
lock. Waiting ior these men to
take the bike. some students ap-
peared and questioned the men,
who then leit emptyrhanded.

A liaison between SGA and Gri-

nnell’s police iorce has been set
up through Russ Adams and pole

Ahrens. "We're a small communi-
ty with a police iorce with lots oi
latitude. We have a certified
locksmith, a certiiied hypnotist.
and a proiessional artist. 1 work

apprehensive about calling."
when questioned about student
assaults, Ahrens replied. “Last
year wasn't bad Females weren’t
approached on campus.” in order
for an assailant to be prosecuted.
Ahrens iniormed JB that a claim
must be iiled by the victim within

Although Campus licpublicans

race. Tom Sepic and Dean
lvicwilliams are corcliair ior the
committee to elect Jepsen, Much
ellort is going to be put into the

Republicans are striving ior a big
voter turn out. McLean mentioned
that “this is one oi the rare elec-
tion years when a large voter turn
out helps Republicans."

When asked iiThe Uulcry which

ivities. he said. “No.” The outcry
is strictly. “a journal oi Conserr
vatwe thought," it will not enr
dorse any political candidate nor
lobby ior any particular organizar
tion. he said. The image the paper
is striving ior is “independent and
credible.” he noted.

The Campus Democrats are

Tom Harkin to speak in South

Lounge on September 27. at 4 pm.

Harkin is running against
Jepsen in the senatorial election.
Kevin Crim. Democratic County
Chairman and writing lab assis~
tant. says that the Harkin-Jepsen
race is one of the most important
senatorial races in the country
because the candidates are
ideological opposites,

Since the outcome hi this par-
ticular election is symbolic of
more than one vote in the Senate.
the national Democratic party has
targeted l-iarkin by allocating
more funds [or him

Carter says that "It is a real
coup to get him to speak in Grin-
nell." The fact that the state
Democratic organization arrang-
ed for Harkin to speak in Crime"
at the preierred 4:00 o'clock time
in the height oi the campaign
season is a sign that Des Moines
values the campus vote. in the
