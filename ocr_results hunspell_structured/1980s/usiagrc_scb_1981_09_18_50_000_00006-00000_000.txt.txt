Campus bands a changin’

New names, styles

by David Hoffman

Campus bands are rarely received with
much enthusiasm here in Grinnell.
Students generally look upon them as
underexperienced overpaid musicians
whose talent is questionable at best.

However, two bands returning from last -

year, the Shrooms and the Johns, are deter-
mined to change the warped image Grin~
nell students have given them,

First, the Shrooms are planning to
change their name, though they have not
decided on a new title In addition to the
new name the Shrooms will also have a new
bassist, Steve Kaganove, due to the loss of
Karl Koch who graduated last year. Mark
Bradshaw, lead vocalist, noted that the
band “missed Karl” but was very happy
with the “technical accomplishments" of
Kaganove, Alan Braddock will be the lead
guitarist again this year, Carol Namkoong
returns on keyboards and Peter Beaton will
round out the rhythm section on drums.
Bryan Liptzin will be joining the group this
year. bringing a Prophet One synthesizer
with him.

The Shrooms' interests are expanding
along with their image, equipment and per-
sonnel changes, Though they do not an.
ticipate a drastic change in style, they do

and music

plan to "upgrade it a notch or two." Brad-
dock felt that last year's audiences were
”generally receptive” but that their
“music was not suited to the gigs” they
played. The Shrooms are hoping to modiiy
their music to make it more suitable for
dancing,

When asked about other bands on cams
pus, Braddock and Bradshaw both comr
mented that animosity and tension caused
by a lack oi practice space and equipment
is their primary concern but that they
“look lorward to more and better coopera~
tion train the beginning." Also the
Shrooms are very interested to see what
other bands are coming up Wlth this
semester,

Because oi their expansion in equipment
and personnel as well as their present at-
titude, the Shroom's future here in Grinnell
is very promising Last year. their parlor
mances were marked by a high level of
technical achievement, musical variety.
and 7 most importantly 7 a good grade of

nor taste on stage and were always enter-

The Johns, on the other hand, are having
to undergo many more significantchanges.

Murder She Said

Directed by Robert Logan, 1962.
Starring Margaret Rutheriord.

Adapted from the novel 4:5" From Part
dington by Agatha Christie

FrL, 9:30 am, SL; Sat. 8p.m., SL

The iirst screen adaptation or one oi
Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mysteries,
Murder. She Said is often considered the
most vivid and intriguing oi the series.
Margaret Rutherford, 69 when the movie
was made, is perfect for the part Of the
brilliant but beiuddled Miss Jane, whose
dusty character, as we soon tind out, masks
a wildly cunning mind. Strangely enough,
the iilm is about a murder, which takes
place on a train and is witnessed by Miss
Marple, who then poses as a housemaid at a
grand estate, where she hopes to solve the
neiarious crime. 7 John Spackman

BYE Bye
Braverman

Directed by Sidney Lumet.
Starring George Sega], Jack Warden.
Sat, 10:30 pm ,ARH, Sun., 9:30 p.m., 5L,

Bye Bye Braverman is based on Wallace
Markfield’s book, To An Early Grave. And,

in my opinion, that is exactly where this
iilrn should have been sent 7 to an early
grave. oi course, there are those among us
who consider Grinnell to be like a
graveyard; but, even urinnell doesn't
deserve this sort oi treatment. Bye. Bye
Braverman. directed by Sidney Lumet and
starring George Segal and Jack Warden, is
the story, iione can call it a story, oi Leslie
Braverman, writer, who dies beiore the
movie begins 7 thus the title. The plot
deals with Braverman’s friends’ reaction
to his death. The acting is quite good and
the writing is iair. There are a few
humorous moments but ior the most part
the iilm is a hodgepodge oi vaguely related
scenes. There is little plot development and
a poor attempt at character development.
when Lumet tries to show us die inner
thoughts and ieelings oi the characters, he
tails miserably, All in all. Bye. Bye Braver-
man shows little promise, ii you are look-
ing to a good iilm this weekend, don't say
hello to Bye. Bye Braverman." ti couldn't

starring Bud Cort, Ruth Gordon.
Fri., 9:30 p.m., ARH; Sun.. 8 p.m., ARH.

Harold and Maude. starring Ruth Gordon
and Bud Cort, is a wonderfully iunny
“black comedy," a wry ode to controlled

at all bleak) at the present time, The Johns,
0r “Profit Motive” as they now Call
themselves, are an almost entirely new
band

Unfortunately, Mike Alexander will not
be returning to Campus first semester, so
Rich Baylock will be taking his place as
drummer. Alexander’s talented drumming
will certainly be missed first semester but
Profit Motive is looking forward to his
return next semester, Tim King will be
replacing Greg Luther on saxophone but
King should augment the hand well,
Charlie Briggs (lead guitar and vocals) and
Mike Heckman lbass) will also be returnv
ing.

Probably the most interesting change
Profit Motive will bring to Grinnell is their
style of music. Punk rock will not figure as
prominently in their repeloire inasmuch as
Profit Motive is going to be a "fun band"
bringing a iunlcrap sound to campus. Their
goal is tor people to have a good time and
they hope that their stylistic change will ac-
complish this Whatever the outcome, Pro
tit Motive promises to bring a vary “17
teresting sound to Grinnell.

When asked to explain the drastic image
Change. bassist Mike Heckman made it
clear that both the name and stylistic
change are an eiiort "to laugh at the lmaEe

by the critics but has since become a cult

keeping pace with a man less than hali her
age. Needless to say, this is not a typical
love story, Rounding out the cast as the
beleaguered mother, vivian Pickles
masterfully spurts arch comments about
her demented son. The combination ol
stylish acting, an imaginative screenplay
by Colin Higgins and the careiul direction
of Hal Ashby (director of The Last Detail)
IS one that works. And of course there is the
priceless priest cameo (those oiyou who've
seen the movie know what I mean).
Granted, it's a pretty sick comedy, but ii
you go along with the spirit of this farce, it
is one of the more innovative American
films in years 7 Catherine Ingrassia

the Johns had last year.” Heckman admit-
ted, as would anyone, that the name “The
Johns" was equated with money because
they were paid $300 for periorming at last
year's James Gang Bang. He went on to
say that Profit Motive “is not pretending
anything. We’re trying to help people have
a good time. We like to make money and
we're not ashamed of it."

”Profit Motive” is, then, a form of pro-
test against the assumption that all on7
campus bands are of inferior quality.
Heckman noted that campus organizations
“are not forced to hire us." He also made
the point that most bands could get more
money oft-campus Margaret Thatcher
and the Supply Side proved that by perior7
ming in nightclubs over the summer) and
that all campus bands are only “asking tor
a small percentage oi what you could nor-
mally get outside should a iood service
worker only get 60 cents an hour simply
because he is living on campus”

Nevertheless, Profit Motive is looking
iorward to performing ior a Grinnell aur
dience, which they characterize as receps
tive to their stage periormance but un~
willing to accept their iinancial situation.
Also. they are looking iorward to
cooperating with other bands this year to
help eliminate ieuds and “petty moments"
caused by equipment and practice space
shortage.

What‘s most important to Profit Motive.
the Shrooms and their audiences as well is
what Heckman Called ”the good time of the
moment." We can only hope that their good
times will be ours as Well.

Slll'illll Band

On this Saturday. the Piper Road Spring
Band will return to Grinnell‘s Campus after
a two year absence. Piper Road is primarlr
ly a bluegrass band whose music encomr
passes not only the more traditional lorms
oi bluegrass but also extends to cover lhe
more upbeat country and blues styles.

The' Piper Road Spring Band has changr
ed somewhat since they last appeared at
Grinnell. This year the band is composed of
only five members, which is somewhat
streamlined compared to the group that
appeared here two years ago.

This listener was particularly impressed
by the group‘s closing song at their last
Grinnell concert, Called ”Just Like a
Dream." This song seemed to epitomize
the idea or the slow, sad country song. For
any lover oi bluegrass and country music
or anyone who just appreciates good iiddle
playing, the Piper Road Spring Band is well
worth seeing. — Marc Conterato
