Mirecourt- Trio releases three- albums

by Lorri Lohmann

Three new Mirecourt Trio albums
have Just been released. All recorded at
Herrick Chapel in ms and 1979, the
albums are now available at the
bookstore. Critical reviews are not yet
out but the following will give you an
idea of what to look forward to on the
recordings,

Johannes Brahms' Trio in A Major
Opus Posthumous (TR Records, Dos
Moinesl was probably Brahm’s earliest
piano trio, thought to have been written
in 1853 when he was 20. A very self-
critical streak led Brahms to destroy
the work as he did with much of his ear-
ly composition Only 25 works survive
out of a total of at least 100 of Brahms’
compositions. Fortunately someone
must have copied the manuscript
before it was burned for it was
discovered in 1924. Terry King suggests
that Brahms may have been unhappy
with the Schumann and Beethoven inv
fluences in the piece but it is con
sidered an unusal masterwork of the
composer.

Anton Dvorak's Trio in F Minor Opus
65 (TR records): Ken Goldsmith called
this trio the “most difficult and least
played" oi Dvorak's and also feels it is
the “best one" because of its deman-
ding, symphonic scope.

Both James Drew's “Orangethorpe
Aria” and Lloyd Rodgers' Trio (ms)
were commissioned by Mirecourt Trio
and recorded with the help of Leslie
Morgan as soprano and Russell Harlow
on the clarinet. Goldsmith describes
Drew as a “typical Irish poet artist;
very Joycian.” An interesting section of
his Ana is the “rock and roll machine.”
Rodgers’ piece echoes tradition by us
ing the same harmonic language as
Brahms and Beethoven.

Also recently released are:

Tschaikowsky's Trio in A Minor Opus
5 (Grand Prix Records, Los Angeles)
Haydn: The Concertos for Cello in D
Major by Terry King and the. Vienna
Chamber Orchestra (TR RecordsJ

The Inn members emphasize their
somewhat unusual way of recording
albums. Traditionally, especially in
their "rarified field" of chamber
music, as King calls it, recording takes
place in studios where performers try
to attain a ﬂawless version of the piece.

lam/cry 30, 1981

This process can become an extended
ordeal of heavy splicing where the
room ambience and echo are synthesiz-
ed by sound engineers.

Goldsmith, King and Jensen echoed
each other with words such as “antisey
tic” and “sterile” to describe this style
of recording. They prefer to take ad-
vantage of Herrick Chapel’s perfect
acoustics. when they record, they play
each movement two or three times,
seeking the deﬁnitive or most inspired
version and little splicing is done.
Goldsmith points out that the
Tschaikowsky recording session lasted
only six hours ior 45 minutes oi playing
time. King described this style as
“more representative of what actually
happens both acoustically and as a per-
formance.” Goldsmith commented on
the occasional competition with “birds,
cars, students and other noises that go
bump in the night."

Chekov play: a

by Kevin L. McKeough

Tryouts for the Theatre
Department's production of Anton
Chekov's The Cherry Orchard were
held Thursday night and will be
repeated this evening at seven. The
auditions will be held in Robert’s
Theatre under the supervision of direc-
tor Ellen Mease.

Set in 19th-century Russia, The
Cherry Orchard deals with the empty
lives of an aristocratic family and their
associates. Throughout the play the
{altering aristocracy, lack of .com—
munication and the conﬂict between
progress and tradition emerge as
dramatic concerns. Despite its serious
foundation and the poignancy of the
underlying themes, The Cherry 0r-
chnrd is intended to be comic, the
humor being found in the actors' perfors
rnances.

In order to achieve this comic effect,
director Mease intends to emphasize
movement, emotional openness and
realism in the performances. The ac-
tors' preparation will include the use oi
techniques created by the Rmsian
director Konstantin Stanislavski.
Acknowledging the considerable

They all conclude that their style
suits their desire to do things different-
ly each time they perform. They also
point out that a more true impression of
the balance within a piano trio is given,
in that the piano is, and remains in their
recordings, the biggest and noisiest in-
strument. Unknown to most people, the
name “Mirecourt,” which the Trio
adopted in 1973, is the name of the
center of violin-making in France in the
17th and 18th centuries. It is locatedjust
outside of Paris.

All three trio members are busy with
group and individual musical pursuits
including future recordings and com-
mercials. as well as this Friday's con-
cert at Herrick which Jensen described
as “short and very sweet and very dif-
ficult.” It will feature a Ravel trio and .
Mozart's Trio in E Major. _

challenge the play posits for its cast,
Mease said “i think Chekov is the most
difficult acting exercise possible.” To
offset this difficulty, Mease plans to
keep the rehearsal schedule ﬂexible
and emphasize individual rehearsals.

Following auditions, a tentative cast
will be selected for call-backs. Call-
back auditions will then take place on
Saturday.

Morganstone
plays in NL

The Dave Greenwald Band will be
playing rock and roll at the dance con-
cert Saturday night. Greenwald, a
Grinnell graduate (1979), from Mar-
shalltown, will play with the other
members of the group ”Morganstone”
at 9:30 pm. in North Lounge. Some of
you may remember his music from a
few years back, so stop by, dance a
while and chat with an old alum.
