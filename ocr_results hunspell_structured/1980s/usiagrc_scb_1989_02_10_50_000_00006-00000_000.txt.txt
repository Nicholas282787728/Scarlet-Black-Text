—Letter Polic

Letters to the editor are a Very important aspect of our
newspaper. However, there are ground mles which must be
followed to ensure that letters are in the best interests of all
parties concerned.

We encourage letters and will print them intact as soon as
time and space permit, Letters in poor taste, judged to be
libelous or not following the guidelines will not be published.

Letters must be signed when they are submitted for
publication. Names will be withheld upon request only in
very rare instances. If it is clear that printing a name will
jeopardize someone's employment or personal well-being, then
it will be withheld. We will print an anonymous letter
only after consulting with the author.

The deadline for letters is midnight the Tuesday before
publication. Letters must be submitted either via the Vax

system (tell Scarlet) or through campus mail (typed).

Readers call Asrelsky
headline sensationalist

To the editor.

This letter arrives a week late.
but my feelings on this subject
are still sufﬁciently strong that I
consider their expression
important.

I did not know Rachel
Asrelsky wellil had seen her on
campus, spoken to her once or
twice. I was nonetheless greatly
offended by the S dc B" 5
treatment of her death, printing
“Asrelsky killed in plane crash”.
as if it were a National Enquirer
headline. The sensationalistie
treatment of Rachel‘s death was
complctcly unnecessary. I have

lost a loved one, and I can truly
say that this is not the way that
people, friends, family should be
rememberedgespecially here, in
this supposedly “tight-knit“
campus community. It would
have been appropriate to run a
more thoughtful headline:
“Rachel Asrelsky Remembered".
I would hope that in the future
the S 62 B'would demonstrate
more tact, though I also fervently
hope that we not have to
experience another such sad event
again. Diane Guniz, Anne
Grnssman

Films Committee criticized
over selection of movies

To the editor:

If the new, long calendar will
be useless by the end of the
semester— owing to
scheduling revisions densely
unpredicted—perhaps the VCR-
slag-heap list of movie titles
could be purged without drawing
too much bestial attention. As it
stands, the whole reads like a
crass parody of what might be
showing at any given week at
any suburban mall cineplex, the
kind of big-audience hackrfare
best reviewed with stars or thumb
symbols. Moveees like Back to
the FulureJrlrlerrpncc, Fatal
Attraction, Ghoslbuslers, Stand
By Me, anybody can see over
break (these are all Summer or

Winter releases), and everyone in
the United States with cable
television already has. If the
PaerV»Films Committee wants
packed houses (to borrow a
marketing phrase from
somewhere) to sate its self-
i‘lattering motives, the job can be
handed to capable S and B re—
viewers whoiit is obvious—can
do bang»up plug work. But so
far they have been yoked with the
tedium of explaining Richard
Dreyfuss‘ acting in this one,
funny little Danny DeVito. how
violent De Palma, ad pablum
inﬁnitum. Mainstream like L.L.
Bean. Even most state schools
offer some programming avenues

Student applauds
Duncan's writing

To the editor.

Friends, Grinnellians, and
fellow writers, lend me your
eyes.

Why, I asked myself today, in
a moment of intense
thoughtfulness, do I regularly
pick up a copy of the Scarlet and
Black on Fridays? Is it to Check
the latest sports scores? No—
Lhat I can do by attending the
games myself, or asking my
classmates. Is it to read the
movie reviews? No—I could go
look thcm up myself in the
library. Is it to amuse myself
with the artful alliteration of
article lines like “Firearms,
ferrets, and feces”? No—I could

struck with an interesting
revelation—I pick up the S and B
to read Jim Duncan‘s column,
“The Human Element," which I
can find nowhere else. This is
truth.

His writing is impeccable,
and I look forward to reading it
with extreme intensity. Please,
please, I beg youiinstead of
“The Human Element” appearing
only every other week, reinstate
it once again on a weekly basis.
1 appeal to your element of
humanity, that element which we
all share, but that only Jim
Duncan can express as well as he
does. Laura Moran ‘92

Love is a Dog from Hell,
Matador, or The Thin Blue Line

for the possibility of renting
