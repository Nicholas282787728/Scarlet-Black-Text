We'll Keep You Posted

Hello and Happy Friday from
SGA! If you've had my kind of
week, I bet you‘re as glad to see
this weekend as I am. I am per-
sonally looking forward to seeing
My Life as a Dog, but I plan to
stay away from that Creature
from the Black Lagoon stuff; I'm
the type who screams at fun
movies like that. Anyway, it's

 

Greg Evans

 

been another life-fulfilling week
in SGA. You might have caught
wind of the exiting joint board
(the student senate) meeting last
Wednesday, and I hope you've
heard of some of the other SGA
projects that are going on now.

One important policy for the
students has been negotiated for
the Health Center. Now, any
student may get FREE non-prey
scription medicine at the Health
Center for several common ally
ments after examination by a
campus nurse or note from your
local doctor. That's essentially
the same service as last year, but
the liability problems have been
worked out. Your senator has
complete information on this
policy.

The Committee formed after
the Rape and Harassment Issues
Open Forum, Safety Committee,
met on Thursday. They are fol-
‘luwjngmp on the suggestions:-
made at the Forum. Both
Executive Vice President Walker
and Dean Crady have assured
SGA that the college will provide
whatever ts necessar‘ (money) to
instill a sense of scan 3 on this
campus, so campus improve
ments should move rather
quickly. in addition, a committee
from Women's Group has formed
to educate students and town or
ganizations about harassment by
doing study breaks. Their
acronym is HEC for Harassment
EdHCation Committee (”being
harassed? Give 'em EEG")

There is so much more to re-
port on, but you’ll have to ask
your senator about other issues

because I want to talk about an-
other issue concerning SGA and
you students. SGA is in the
process of developing its consti-
tution that you students will
eventually decide whetltcr or not
to ratify. The constitution serves
as a guideline for the working of
our self-govcming student body.
Putting aside specific issues for a
moment, the constitution and its
by-laws are a way of stating what
should be done to best benefit
students and ensure that none of
those students are treated unfairly
in any way. I think we'can all
agree students need to be treated
fairly and equally, We can also
agree that we students should de—
cide for ourselves what that
treatment is and how we should
go about implementing that
ueattnent Like I said a couple of

weeks ago, SGA ls by and for the

students above all else.

With that perspective in ,

mind, I ask you to consider how
SGA is going about deciding the
contents of our constitution.
First we have knowledgeable
studean find weaknesses in the
old constitution and make revis-
ing suggestions, these suggestion
are discussed with the Deans,
President Drake. the cabinet and,
of course, joint board. After that.
SGA will again discuss the
changes and policies with the
students before anyone ratifies
anything.“ Tm’ sttreyotjr ba‘n

 

derstaitd that process seems long"

and tiring, but, that IS democracy
in action. The alternative is sim-
ply not to ask, not to discuss,
and then live with the conse-
quences. So, for the next couple
of weeks at least, SGA will be
arguing and nit-picking and {i
nally getting something of great
importance to all of us done. We
are taking our own government
into our own hands; we may have
been all thumbs last Wednesday.
but eventually we shall have a
constitution that ﬁts our needs.

I think that's it for this week.
Please talk to your senator, make
suggestions. and. as always, we'll
keep you posted, promise.
