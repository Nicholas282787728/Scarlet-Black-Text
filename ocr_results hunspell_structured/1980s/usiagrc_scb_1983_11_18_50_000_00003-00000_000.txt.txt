Women’s Resource Center

by Paula Nixon

When Laura X. founder of the Berkeley
Women's Resource’ Center. vlSlted Grin-
nell recently, she inspired Shelah Wood.
83. to organize a Women's Resource
Center lWRCl here on campus when
Shelah was a student. she had sensed that
women's needs were only being partially
met by various, unconnected College
organizations For example, the women’s
Group. Freeze and Disai'm. or the Internets

nal Student Organization each concerns
itself with women's issues. but none offers
a local point lor the special needs or all
women A “RC would not only provide
such a local point. it would also be the
center for women-oriented actiVIties at
Grinnell

An 0 -campus house that is open to the
entire campus would provide private
meeting space [or all kinds or women or-
tistic. lesbian. political. feminist. and in~
ternatlonal lto name a fewl. Furthermore.
the WRC would be an ideal location for the
Escort Service. Kitchen laeilitles would
also be available for coffeehouse and
potluck preparation in addition. a
women's library would include books and
periodicals train all disciplines, plus local
material and newsletters from the Grins
neli National Organization oi women, the
Grinnell League of Women Voters, and
groups from Iowa City,

At present all of the information receive
ed from these groups is on file in the Stun
dent Activities Room, located in the
Forum basement. According to senior Gail
Fisher, there will be a proposal to house all
student groups in the Forum basement, ii
and when the space now occupied by ad-
missions becomes available The idea at

transiorming the Forum into a Student
union is good, but the Forum would not
provide an appropriate atmosphere tor a
WRC,

Laura Donnelly. a inembe of Women 5
Group. points out why the Forum is iliaDn
propriate: “You get kicked out of the
r'oi'um at midnight, a WRC should be a
place where people can go 24 hours a day.
Also, if I were feeling bummed—out. I'd feel
lunny walking into the Forum — I'd rather
go to a house" Students who elected to
monitor the WRC would be trained as S A s
and so be able to handle emergency situun
tions. such as rape. as well as small crises.
su h as bummed-out studenls

'e heard complaints from Student Afr
iairs that the counseling services are not
lully used," says shelah ”WRC would pro-
vide a list of Counselors and their
specialties as well as the privacy needed
for counseling sessions." Shelah hopes
that the WRC will be established in 1984.
but Concedes that much depends on fun
ding. "It depends on the administration.
I'm hoping that some money tor books
would come from the library, We're also
considering asking the Rnseni‘ield Come
mittee and the Melissa Gerhardsteln
Memorial Fund for support We also enn
courage donations irom individuals — not
only money, but books and kitchen equip»
ment, too,"

Do we really need a Women's Resource
Center? Yes! The diversity at women-
related interests necessitates their syn~
thesis; a wnc is the place ior such syn
thesis. A trial period of one semester or
one year would surely prove the need tor a
focal point for women‘s activities here at
Grinnell.

Women ’s Concert

by Karry Koon

Twelve students from the College at-
tended a women's music concert in Mine
neapolis on November 4. The concert, 3
dynamic blend of folk and rock selections,
was sponsored by AVA productions and
mind Records. two women’s music com-
panies, Appearing in the concert were
musicians Teresa Trull, Barbara Higbie,
Meg Christian, Chris Williamson, and Tret
Fure, Sign language artist Susan
Freundlich translated the lyrics and
banter of the musicians for the benefit of
the hearingnimpaired.

Teresa Trull and Barbara Higbie. a
team irom Caliiornia, played selections
from their album, ”Unexpected." Their
style is mostly leminist [olk, with some in-
strumentals thrown in occasionally.
Teresa is witty, and Barbara is a wonder-
lul pianist,

Meg Christian and Chris Williamson, the
big-name stars and the founders of Olivia
Records, periormed a pleasant combines
tion or old and new tunes, Meg played
selections from her new album, which will

be released in the spring. Meg and Chris
had a back-up band, and the band played a
synthesizer and drums throughout much or
the concert. This was definitely a move
away from their simpler one or two
instrument style, l was disappointed that
the two or them didn'tslng togeuier; lwas
hoping for something from the album,
”Meg and Chris, Live at Carnegie Hall."

My lavorite part of the concert was the
set by Tret Fure ipronounoed "Fury”i,
the hot young rock artist oiolivia Records,
She energetically sang several songs trom
her so to-be-released album. “Terminal
Hold,’ including the title song, which ex-
presses her annoyance at being put on hold
and tortured with Muzak when using the
telephone A line iroin one of her songs is,
“I will be true. but truth can change " This
woman is tough.

Over all, the concert was excellent.
Watch for the new Olivia releases, and
listen to the Women's Voices radio show on

there are people who are trying to help
Women to understand themselves and
discover their own roles in the World,
rather than keep up the old roles and
stereotypes emphasized by the media and
advertising. Through films, speakers,
discussions, and getting to know each
other in social events such as potiucks.
Women‘s Group gives individual women
the opportunity to develop their own per-
sonalities instead of conforming to
society‘s image of what women should be
Sometimes I am discouraged by the way I
see women treated around me, or the way
women treat themselves, or sometimes l

Health

by Sandra Laursen

The campus Women's Group has
directed a considerable amount of time
and energy in the past lew semesters
toward the issue of health care for women.
Certainly. a good many other topics
deserve equal attention 7 violence against
women, the revival of the Equal Rights
Amendment. and economic disci‘imin‘eb
tion. to name Just a lew. Why. then. have
We focused on health care”

Our primary objective is awareness
Women and men alike must recognize the
special health care concerns of women
These include not Just the "obvious” topics
of birth control and abortion, but
menstrual irregularities. venereal
disease, pregnancy, rape. mental health.
sexuality and related values By knowing
about the health problems we all lace as
women, we can become our own best
health consultants We hope, too, that in
raising our own consciousness, we will
raise the consciousness of the men around
us, and help them to become more sen-
sitive to our needs and to their own roles in
addressing these needs

Recognizing our common health care
problems is not enough. Women must
know where and how to get the care we
want and require. General practitioners.
obstetricians and gynecologists, mental
health counselors, women's clinics. the
college health service, student affairs
staff, and RA all have different
facilities, capabi | ies and specialties for
maintaining women's health. However,
unless information on these institutions is
readily yet confidentially accessible. the
services they offer will go unused and the
people they might serve will go unaided

Women‘s Group has tried to increase
awareness of women’s health problems
and solutions in several ways. Last spring
we rewrote and expanded the booklet
”Women's Health Care Resources," last
published in 1990. This topage booklet con
tains detailed information on the doctors,
clinics, and other servicesavallable m and
around Grinnell It also includes a
glossary and general articles on anatomy,
the menstrual cycle. breast self-
examination, methods ol contraception
and abortion, The booklets were first
distributed to female students, faculty,
and staff in April and will be made
available to new students each fall for the
next several years,

Last month Women‘s Group co-
sponosred, with the Grinnell chapter or the
National Organization for Women (NOW).
a panel discussion of local health care for

are

women The panelists included represen-
tatives of various health services in
Poweshiek County involving social, men-
tal. and physical aspects of health We also
continue to sponsor shuttles to women's
clinics in larger cities. in order to provide
an alternative to local male physicians.
Women's Group believes that regular
health care is a necessary and important
part of every- woman‘s life. Women pay 25‘
percent more visits to doctors (90 percent
or whom are male). purchase 50 percent
more prescription drugs. and are admitted
more lrequently to hospitals than men *
Obviously. we have a large stake in the
quality oi health care. However. women‘s
health care is too often corrective rather
than preventive medicine. That is, treat
ment or the body's symptoms occurs only
after the problem has arisen, rather than
as a prevention to the onset of a crisis Our
orientation toward getting well instead oi
keeping well and our attitudes on the pro-
per iunction at health care must change.
The iirst step in this process is increasing
our own and others' awareness of women's
health and health care. Our right to our
bodies is our right to our lives.
