Admissions wouldn’t care that they
ass‘lgned a prospective to stay with a
gay student here in Grinncll. Well, ad-

' Here how it worked: Someone con-
vinccd a prospective assigned to stay
with a gay student to avoid the gay
student entirely. Someone offered the
prospective another place to stay. The
prospective never found out who his
intended host was, except for the ap-
parently crucial, apparently damning
fact that his intended was gay.

It’s a sad melodrama that perhaps
in and of itsell warrants little atten-
tian. But because it is not unlikely that
a number of people would think that

about who they’re put up with, the in

was right, perhaps we shouldn't leave
it to the righteous concern or a single
