The candidates from Grinnell
Janet: Car-l

by Richard lslrhngci

Getting to this point my not have
been by the most usual methods or by
the most direct path, but the fact is that
Janet Carl, associate dean of Student
Affairs, is the Democratic candidate
for the state house from the 71st
District.

Carl was nominated to be the cans
didale by a special convention 0i
precinct members from the entire
legislative district. Originally Mary
Hartnett, a recent Grinnell graduate,
was to be the Democratic candidate.
but she declined after she decided to ac
cept a scholaiship to New York Univerr
sity Law School.

The third candidate in the primary
was Gordon Eariey. Earley was quoted
in the Oct. IS issue of The Des Moines
Register as saying that ”there was
quite a bit ol arm-misting by the
powers that be to get Janet Carl
elected."

' ”Nothing could be further from the
truth,” Carl said in responding to
Earley‘s words, “The state party was
completely surprised when l got in

. touch with them, Earley was doing no
campaigning and i think that ﬂiey (the
party) wanted someone who would
work hard to retain the seat.“

Now that she is the candidate,
another twist entered the story when
Gregg Edwards, a 1930 graduate oi
Grinnell. became the Republican can-
didate. Commenting on her opponent
and how she (all they matched up Carl
said, “I like Gregg. This is a
Democratic district and'Gregg is a

moderate Republican. The big dii'v
lerence between us stems horn our
basic beliefs and which party we
believe in. This would be the diflerence
when we get to the legislature."

“I do think," Carl added, "that he
lacks experience in things like
budgeting and problem-solving;
general decision-making.”

As for the issues, Carl believes that
they all relate to one basic iacior, what
she calls “the financial crunch that we
are in," She is quick to point out that
most of the ills are the work of a
Republican legislature.

“They overestimated the revenue
from the budget and then the
legislature passed a tax rebate — this
wiped out the surplus and the plans lor
tax indexing,” Carl said. “They then
had to increase the property lax by $12
million, so the money could lit into the
school funding formula."

Carl also has concerns for utility rate
reform and iunding for programs [or
older iowans, She supports ERA
because, as she said, "It‘s iair and
overdue, and will clear the courm of
discrimination cases." She feels that
specilic legislation needs to be enacted
on inheritance tax laws for lamily
iarms, so that spouses aren't iorced to
sell the lamily larm to pay oli the taxes.
Carl also wants to see legislation go fur»
ther with soil conservation laws and
laws that give tax incentives to people
who make their homes more energy efv
iicient.

"Thelwo big issues the legislature
has to lace are the budget and reapor-
tionment,“ Carl said. “We'll have to
make some decisions and my priorities
are in programs for the elderly: educa-
tion; and human services for the
jobless and disadvantaged."

Carl said that she is running because
her “political consciousness was rais-
ed. We all feel that bad decisions are
being made in government and that
there was nothing we could do about it.
The challenge is to do something about
it and I think that that's something I
can do well,” she said.

And if Carl wins on Tuesday? “I will
resign in December 7 sadly Leaving
Grinnell has been the hardest part of
my decision.
