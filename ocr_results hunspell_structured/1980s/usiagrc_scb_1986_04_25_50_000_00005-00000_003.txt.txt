New Belay: Security Measure

by Scoop
As part of the continuing revismns in
Relay's my, the snow fence surrounding
the relays will be charged with 2000 volts oi
electricity in an etiort to contain the hun-
dreds of intoxicated revelers. Dale l-Iawn,
the director at building and grounds said
that the campus gets trashed every year
by relays and that it was about time for a
change, Hawn said, “It's about time we
contain all of these drunken college kids...
Why, I just can’t Wait for one of those saucV
ed kids to hit the fence... ZAPPO! K"
Dean of Student Affairs, Jim Tedermanr
said in reIerence to the electrified fence,
“All along, I haven't been in favor of an
electrified fence but the college talked to
Its lawyer abuut liability and we always do
what the lawyers tell us to do. The lawyers

told us tu use an electrified fence,"

President Drake said, “I think the idea
or a high voltage rence is a good one, it will
teach students respect lor lawyers. Just
the kind of lessons that I learned when I
was at Dxiord as a Rhodes Scholar."

Yet the most enlightening comments
came lrom H. Wayne Moyer, who said,
“this is a periect example at mispercep-
tions as reality. The rational actor
paradigm works well in attempting to
understand Dale Hawn. He will be in
cremental and muddle thruugh,"

As (or student reaction, Rebecca Quirk,
the much-quoted member of the relays
committee, said, “The tence is completely
unjustified tor it will only promote the
throwing of beer and we just don’t want
that! l l " Barb Cardell, another member of
the relays committee said “WOW! ”
