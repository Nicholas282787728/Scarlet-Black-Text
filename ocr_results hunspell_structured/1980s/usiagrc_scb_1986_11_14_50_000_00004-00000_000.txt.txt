Thursday, November 20. will be a time
to join in a national effort, a national
”spirit" to set aside the cigarettes, cigars,
pipes, and even the matches for at least 24
hours. The American Cancer Society will
be observing its 10th annual Great
American Smokeout, and Grinnell will not
be left out, Or will it?

Nancy Suggs, student coordinator for
the Smokeout at Grinnell College sees the
day as a rare opportunity for all smokers
to take the day off from smoking together.
“When everybody is doing it. and non
smoking friends are giving their support
and encouragement, it becomes an easier
goal to accomplish,”

The committee promoting the Smokeout
Will be putting up posters and “table
tents” in the dining halls, and distributing

Music Prof.

HostsCellist
' Protegé

by Kristen Brown

Although it is common for foreign
students to come to the city of Grinnell to
study at the college, it is not often that they
come only to study music. Yet this year,
Sacha Swarowsky is doing just that. He is
living and studying cello with Terry King,
a professor in the music department and
the cellist in the Mirecourt Trio.

Swarowsky, who is from the suburbs of
Paris. is not staying in the United States as
part of any exchange program. He met
Kin about eleven years ago, when Kine
Stu ied conducting under Swarowsky’s
father in Vienna. At that time Swarowsky
was only ten years old, but he had already
been playing the cello for two years.

Since he doesn’t attend classes at the col-
lege, Swarowsky spends much of his time
practicing the cello. “Usually I try to prac-
tice about four hours each day” Besides
practicing, he dedicates many hours to
playing in various chamber groups and
student recitals at Grinnell. But perhaps
even more time consuming is the time he
puts into playing with the Cedar Rapids
Symphony. although he plays a wide
variety of music, Swarowsky says he en-
joys the music of Bach and Brahams the
most. He also enjoys doing other things
besides playing the cello such as
photography and skiing.

As for the future, Swarowsky plans to
study the cello in Grinnell until April when
he will return to Paris, He will continue his
involvement in music and hopes to play
professionally, “preferably with a
chamber group instead of an orchestra."

fliers through campus mail to draw attcns
Lion to the Significance of the day. They
feel the more exposure the event has, the
greater the overall effect will be.
According to Suggs, the desired effect is
that individual participants will feel a

. “personal satisfaction" or a ”sense of suc-

cess." Individuals have the chance to ask
themselves. “Why doi smoke?" and weigh
the options for 24 hours between smoking
or not smoking. “One day [without smok~
ingl might make a person feel worse, but
at least he or she can THINK about the
habit, and effectively decide what course
to take.

Suggs also realizes the difficulty to quit
here at Grinnell, Because of the stress in-
volved in college for both faculty and
students, “Smoking is a habit that is often
acquired as a result of" stress. and quitting
in this environment can seem impossible
some days. We are hoping that the
Smokeout will provide an incentive.”

How do smokers respond to this "169er
live?

“I smoke because I want to, I’m not go-
ing to quit," states one professor. A small
red-lettered Sign on his desk makes itself
obvious among the stacks of paper:
“Thanks for holding your breath while I
smoke."

Many students feel the same way. Indifs
ference to the subject abounds, though it is
not a reﬂection of ignorance on the issue.
The present generation has been made

aware of the hazards and social implica»
tions of smoking as they have grown up
over the past ten years.

Some Students are just not excited by the
“challenge” the Smokeout offers. One stur
dent read about the event and is planning
on participating, despite the fact that he
felt “quitting [or one day doesn't really
constitute quitting The twenty-four hours
seems irrelevant " Another student Views
ed the publiClty and the day in itself as
”good if it makes people think," and Grins
nell IS the perfect place for encouraging in»

A few students feel the whole idea is a bit
discriminating, but for the most part,
students are unoffended, uninsulted, ind

leaving Grinnell as apathetic to the issue
as before, One professor who will be par-

he sees the 24-hour Smokeout as merely a
symbolic action, he feels “any antis
smoking symbols are relevant,"

A campus maid commented as well that
having a day set aside was an incentive, at
least another reminder that there are
others thinking about the same things.

Spare Some Time at Bbwladrome

by Mohael Warobec

Cold beer. warm mid~western pers
sonalities, and occasionally hot competi»
tion, is the standard atmosphere at
Bowladrome, the oldest bowling esmblishs
ment in Grinnell, located at 915 State St.

The popularity of bowling has grown
recently, especially in suburban areas of
the country, Some attribute this growth to
the “yuppie“ intellect, urbanites who
delight in infiltrating an American ethnic
sport. There is also the theory of the innate
stone-rolling instinct. However, Jim 3qu
fum‘s opinion is that bowling is a Chance to
have “a good time, exercise, and drink a
few beers.“ seems to bring out the true
reasons for bowling's popularity in
America,

Jim Buffum, owner of Bowladrome,
feels that bowling, particularly league
bowling, provides just such a chance.

in the stone age, cave persons on Tues
day and Thursday night used to climbto
the top of hills and roll boulders at woolly
mammoths. In teams of four' they would
compete for mates, territory, and tasks,

of beer, However, with the development of

more conplex societies. it became
necessary to satisfy humanity’s innate in-
stinct to roll balls at targets with bowling.
Thus, in 1947, Bowladrnme Lanes was

opened.
In 1958, the alley was bought by Joe Buf-

up with a “bar“ adjacent to it, providing
daily entertainment from 1:30 in the after-
noon until. according to Jim Buflum,

“everyone has left.”
The lanes themselves are of good quality

and the lights above the pins, indicating
which pins are still up, actually work,
something a regular bowler rarely finds,
even at computerized “Bowl-America“
lanesf '

Not more than three weeks ago, a man
from Newton bowled a three hundred (a
perfect game) at Bowladrom, illustrating
the high lane quality. He was trying out for
the November 30 edition of the longest run
ning bowling show. “Let's Go Bowling.“

The spectator area consiss of a row of
wooden moviestyle seats in front of which
is a rail specially designed as a rack to
hold bar bottles,

The bar, “Buffy’s,” is a typical mids
western bar, wood-clad walls. a modest
bar, a few booms, and a color television
tuned to a bowling program

Leagues play every night except Satur-
day, The leagues are open to college
students. There are men’s, women‘s and
mixed leagues. If there is enough interest.
Buffum is open to the creation of a Grinnell
