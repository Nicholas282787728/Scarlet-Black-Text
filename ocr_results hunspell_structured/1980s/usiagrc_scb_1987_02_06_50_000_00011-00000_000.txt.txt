straight games on the road, Coach Smith
was looking forward to returning to his
home gym, where he knew his team was
extremely tough to beat. The team lived up
to his expectations, catching yet another
team in their home-ﬁeld web, Posting a 5-1
record in Darby, the m 1e cagers are
showing the southern di sion that yes,
they too should be taken seriously.

Lake Forest is wishingthat they had
bypassed I-Bo, driving past Grinnell
altogether. They fell victim to a hot»
shooting Pioneer squad, getting trounced
90777. The 13-point margin, however,
doesn't do the victors justice, dominating
as they did trom the opening tip. Terry
“The Snake" Chapko scored 25 points to
lead the team while Daryl “The Ultimate"
Scott added 17 points of his own In this
Midwest Conierence romp.

This marked a key victory for the
Pioneers. They demonstrated their true
ability and ran their opponents oif the
court with good, fundamental basketball.
According to Chapko, “It was good to be
back in Darby. It was our first home game
in quite a while, and. not coincidentally, a
wm."

The Pioneers continued this high-
spirited play Saturday alternocn against
the University oi Chicago Maroons,
previously rankedestress that past tense»
at eighteenth, nationally. In one of their
best games of the season, Grinnell upset U.
oi C. in an overtime thriller, 75-72, earning
respect throughout. the league.

game in the closing moments, ireshman
Mike “Altrederick Cl” Spurbeck, calm, cool
and collected, hit .the go-ahead jumper
irom behind the hoop with one tick lett on
the Clock, But the men in the zebra outfits--
who were the center of controversy all
afternooneeruled that there were two
seconds left. The University of Chicago
took advantage oi this extra second by
throwing a football pass the length at the
court to an open man, who tied the game
with a turnaround “J,”

The Pioneers took charge in the next five
minutes, building up an eight-point lead.
After the smoke [inally cleared (and with
some fists almost thrown), the score was
in favor ol Grinnell. U. of C. still doesn't

”Beating one oi the top 20 teams shows
that we have the talent, and can beat
almost any given team on any given night
in Darby,” Bring on ‘ those “Runnin'
Rebels!” .

The Grinnell men's swim team swam an
excellent meet against University oi Nore

thern iowa on Thursday, January 22; but, '

that was not enough to beat the highly
rated Division I school.

The score was 96-108. but Ireshman
Steve Pickle remarked, ”The Coach was
really pleased with how we did. because
UNI is a Division I school with active
recruiting and all that "

Tim Laughinghouse, a junior, agreed;
he Commented that the team and Coach
Ray Obermiller were “really happy,
because we came within 20 points oi \vinn-

mg.”

Senior Tim Brouillette, with his usual
outstanding periormance. won both the
lemeter and the 3»meter diving events,
Junior Bob Wandlmg placed iirst in the
ireestyle, and Laughinghouse won the 100
butterﬂy Those were the only events that
the Grinnell men won, ‘

why was the score so close, then?

“It was the depth that made a big dil»
lerence," Laughinghouse said with convic-
tion. “They scored through live events; so,
our seconds, thirds. and fourths all added
to the score. even though we might not

have taken the first 5.
