Not Wet Behind the Ears

swimming squad proved that they yet
belong at the top of the swimming ranks,
despite coach Ray Obermiller's prediction

Friday night in a double dual, the
Pioneers drowned the U. of Missouri at St.
Louis, 11566. but were nicked by
Washington University in the final relay to
lose 93-90.

Pioneer Relays were again decided by the
linal relay. Washington and Northeast
Missouri tied for first with 142 points.
followed closely by Grinnell with 138.

“Looking at the overall Friday»Saturday

picture, our inexperienced team did a
remarkable job," Coach Obermiller said
in retrospect. “Our opponents.
Washington and Northeast Missouri. are
stronger and they had the advantage ol
more training time and previous meets.
I’m not displeased: I see our potential."

Grlnnell won three evean in the dual
versus Washington, whose victory over the
Pioneers was the ﬁrst in several years.
The 200 medley quartet of Tom Welander.

Kevin Doershug took first, as did Tim
Brouillette in diving and Laughinghouse in

Depth of Women’s Team
Leads to Succesful Weekend

The women fared equally well in their
opening competition. indicating that the
loss of six top swimmers to graduation is
being adequately compensated for.

in Friday's double-dual. Grlnnell edged
Washington University, 93,90. and easily
defeated Buena Vista. 143724. The win
against Washington was decided in the
final relay. as Grinnell's zoo treestyle “l3"
team of Anne Bradley. Meg Takayama,
Jennie Robinson, and Kathryn Costello
slipped past Washington's “B” team for
the victory

Washington gained revenge for the
previous night's defeat by finishing ahead
of Grlnnell’s third place effort in the last
relay, which was won by Northeast
Missouri.

“I was very pleased and a little surpris-
ed about the weekend in general,” Coach
Martha Rowedder commented. “There
were a lot of good individual times and a
good team effort. which contributed to the
great team showing." This depth should
continue to help the Pioneers. as they
finished third Saturday without placing
iirst in any of the relays.

Both teams face Coe in Cedar Rapids

off to

Sluggish Start

by Bob Litton

The Pioneers played a tough first half in
their opener against Upper lowa, losing by
only 6. at 38732. The second half, however,
didn't prove to be too promising, as Grins
nell went on to lose by the score of 8060. It
definitely was a difficult way to begin the
season.

Assessing his team's performance,
coach Gar Smith noted that Upper Iowa
had exceptional delensive quickness,
They also had an outstanding player. an
all-around great athlete who pounded the
Pioneers with at points, According to
Smith. “Playing against ourselves in prac~
tice didnt prepare us {or the game. It
showed‘ in our 23 turnovers.

Things unfortunately didn’t turn around
in their last outing against Dordt. The
Pioneers again hung strong at half. down
by the familiar three buckets, at 47-41.
This was as close as it was going to get,
The roof caved in the second half. crushing
Grlnnell. Final score: 104451.

Smith knew that his team was going to
have to score big in Dordt's gym it they
were going to have any chance at all. it

didn't help matters any that the team was
handicapped by the losses or two starters.
Without the services of guard Terry
Chapko who went down with a foot injury,
the Pioneers lost some valuable outside
shooting, The absence of Steve Lngsdon in
the middle was also costly. as Dordt's all-
~American center dominated, scoring 45
points, Hopelully the two lettermen will be
ready for the games this weekend.
Rummaging positive aspects out of the
debacle. Smith was pleased to have given

playing time to most of his players.

especially the freshmen. He feels this will
prove to be beneficial down the road.

The Pioneers will try to snap their losing
streak this weekend. Smith is hoping that
these two experiences. playing in Darby
and extra practice time, will all pay oh. “1
reel good about coming back home. A good
crowd turnout can help our team get over
the hump " Listen to the coaches plug and
come watch the Pioneers open their home
season. Tip off is a 7130(JV at 5:30) Friday
against Buena Vista and Saturday against

Cowles from page 5
Part 2. Cowles second, .

(Someone on third told me to say' “Paul
Leschensky lives on BOTH floors”)

I wandered down to second, and just
about the only person there, or that I saw
anyway, was Russ Grimm.

“Well, with the smell and the sound of
the food service all the‘time, it can get

Chen," lEast Cowles Second suite.l

“A good thing about livmg in a suite at
the end of the hall is that we have a lot of
privacy. no one visits us."

At that moment, Wallace Squibb.
another resident of the suite, came in and,
when informed of who I was and the pur-
pose of my vlsit. he said of Cowles; “It
sucks,” (Fascinating how different people
have dlfferent reactions, isn't it?)

Russ mentioned that “we have our own‘
private entrance into the kitchen."

Wallace seemed to change his mind and
commented. “I love Cowles because my
RHA does everything he can to help me.”

He said of Cowles,

“It sucks.”

Then he left, and Russ continued. “Both
suites on this floor are football players.
and we’ve had some pretty wild times up
here ~ keg parties and so on. The strange
thing is that people who live in Cowles
never come to them — just the football
team and our friends. We're not trying to
keep them out. they just never show up.”

I thanked Russ. left. and went to track
down anyone who was a freshman and did

“Well. Cowles is moderately qulet . . .

there's football players. swimmers, soccer

“We're friendly. We adopt a lot of peo-

“You can't sum up Cowles. There's no
