When he iorswore the responsib ities
if leading British blues~rock
upergruups, Eric Clapton began a solo
areer marked by an uncertainty ot
usical direction, Over Hie past 10
ears Clapton had dabbled with country
nd reggae music (shades of the Rail
ng Stones) while maintaining a
ometimes tenuous commitment to the
lues. Not much has changed on

other Ticket, Clapton's first studio
elease oi the 19805.

Like so many of his compatriots from
he British blues invasion, Clapton has
allowed with age, His guitar playing
srelaxed and without ambition and his
ompositions stem for the most part
rom the same country-funk Vein as
‘Lay Down Sally" from his Slowhand
lbum. Though this combination yields
he rousing honky~tonk “Hold Me
lord,“ most of the music, including the
lhumopening “Something Special"

and the title track, comes off sounding
like the Grateful Dead.

Part or the problem is the emphasis -

Clapton gives to his vocals, Singing has
never been his forte and this fact
becomes painfully apparent without his
strong guitar work supporting him.
Clapton's only clear vocal success is a
cover treatment of Seals and Setsers'
“Black Rose" While his own “Catch Me
If You Can” and “I Can't Stand It"
sound like out-takes from the last Jack
Bruce album.

Perhaps Clapton should be commend-
ed for his restraint but the lack of drive
exhibited on “Floating Bridges" is
endemic to the entire album. It
hampers his treatment of Muddy
Waters' “Blow Wind Blow” in par
ticular. It's the perfect vehicle for Clay
tan, a rollicking blues tune that works
well with the added delta flavoring. He
plays well on it, his fingers glide

smoothly through the obligatory solos
but it's impossible to shake the feeling
he's not trying very hard. Were Clapton
to exert a little more effort in this direce .
tion, he could establish a strong .

‘foothold in the bayou-region blues that

made Creedence Clearwater Revival so
successful and has characterized some
of his better work such as “Let It
Rain.”

What Clapton could accomplish in
this area becomes clear upon hearing
"Rita Mae." It's the album's showpiece
despite Tom Dowd’s muitied produc-
tion. For once Clapton doesn’t rely on
his vocals to pull the song along. He
sings over Albert Lee's rhythm guitar
with a minimum of effort before joining
in with Lee for the album's longest and
most fulfilling solos. It's been a long
time since Clapton has sounded nus
good on record and his decision to close
the album with "Rita Mae” is hoped to
be a portent of things to come.
