Schneid

while i was calmly watching the
debacle between the us. Olympic
Hockey team and the West Ger-
mans, something very strange ap-
peared on my screen. it wasn't the
U.S.A. disgracing the legacy oi
Mike Eurizone and Jim Craig. It
wasn't Al Michaels' ingenious
description of the hockey action
(“Millen nicely extricated the
puck from the corner"). It wasn't
the psychedelic colors or the West
Germans' uniforms. As the
camera panned the action, the
oddest-looking hockey ian kepl
leaping into View. At first I thought
it was Bob and Doug McKenzie
aiter a iew too many beers. But
upon iurther inspection, 1 iound
that it was none other than the
iamous San Diego Chicken. waving
his red. purple. and yellow wings
for the red. white, and blue
Perhaps the only thing sadder than
the U.S.A.'s loss in the hockey was
my instant realization that the OP
iicial mascot oi our line country is
a stuffed chicken.

While watching the chicken
orgasmically cheer on the hockey
team, I decided that Grinnell Col-
lege needed a mascot. A mascot
would add to the total entertain-
ment product of a Grinnell game
and would increase the joy of the
“Grinnell Experience." Without a
creature oi comedy, most sporting
events are as exciting as a George
Bush speech. Everybody laughs at
the cliched slapstick antics of the
liferslzed animals. A good mascot
at the Grinnell games will create
sellout crowds lor every home
game. After all, the biggest draw
in sporLs today is not an athlete like
Michael Jordan. but rather the
famous chicken.

But more important than large
crowds, Grinnell College needs a
mascot in order to become the first
college in the vaunted us. News
and World Report rankings to have
its own mascot.

A mascot must in some way
symbolically represent the college,
so that the association with the
creature will instantly correspond
to the college. Grinnell's nickname
is the Pioneers, which is more of an
aiterthought than a symbol or the
school. The only thing Grinnell has
pioneered lately has been the in»
Stitution of nine-percent tuition
hikes.

Grinnell could have a mascot
dressed up as a silicon chip. alter
the success of alumnus Robert
Noyce. However. a siliconrchip
mascot would be more suited for
Nintendo Baseball than Midwest
Conference baseball. The mascot
could be designed after Rawson-
Gates Tower, which is on the in-
signia oi the town But when was
the last time you laughed at a
building, excluding the science
building addition? The mascot
could be dressed as a ghost, sym-
holizing the college's endowment.
a haunting spirit always talked
about but never seen

i propose that Grinnell College‘s
new mascot should be the reds
striped slug, The college already
paid $40,000 ior the new logo; why
not embody the logo into an attrac-
tive mascot? The red-striped slug
would provide instant rccognition
ior the new logo. and would iirmly
plant the name of Grinnell College
upon the lips or every highschool
student with SATs over lltlo, Grln'

nell students will love the slug.
especially if the slug slimes the
Coe cheerleaders Furthermore,
the slug already reprisents the en-
thusiasm level of the Grinnell
students towards sports. The ad»
ministration would love the slug.
because it represents the true
meaning oi a libcralarts educa-
tion. Like a liberal-arts education,
the slug is wellrrounded and of no
use to society. In addition to the
enormous popularity the slug will
have with the college. the town will
also become enamoured of it With
the gross success oi the Garbage
Pail Kids. the children from the
town of Grinnell will flock to see
the slitheririg. gray creature, With
the planning or Grinnell 2000, there
would be no better Creature to
represent the 21st century than the
ultra-modern slug.

Twenty years irom now, aiter
Grinnell athletic teams have cap
tured a plethora oi championship
trophies. the redrstriped slug will
not be a strange novelty. The slug
will become recognized around the
world as a symbol or excellence,
and Grinnell College will always be
associated with a slimy gray-and
red creature.

looked at in the context oi Biblical
times. Homosexual acts, like pro-
miscuity, were viewed as
idolatrous acts and succumbing to
one's lusts. Today. homosexuality
must be viewed in a diiierent light.
We cannot ignore modern research
and studies. Having observed
homosexuals here and having
close iriends who are gay, I know
that homosexual relationships can
be just as exclusive and loving as
the ideal heterosexual relation-
ships, Today we cannot use the Bi-
ble as the only tool to evaluate the
issue oi homosexualiiy. since
homosexuality is not now con-
sidered what it was in biblical
times.

As ior homosexuality being con-
sidered a sin. rurnish says. and i
agree: "For Paul neither
homosexual practice nor
heterosexual promiscuity nor any
other specific vice is identified as
such with ‘sin.’ " (p.31)

I cannot proclaim homosexuality
a sin. I, as a Christian. struggle
with my faith and the Scripture
and come up with a strong but New
ible set or belieis which include a
complete acceptance oi homosex-
uality, ior it is an expression oi
love. one oi the most beautiiul ex-
pressions or love in the Bible is
found in the story of Ruth. It is bet

3-2 Program

middle of Iowa, I have little doubt
that most proiessors will jump at
these options. Whether or not the
3-2 program will bring in better
proiessorsto start with, i do not
know, but I doubt that it will serve
to keep them here,

Many times since coming to this
college i have been told by laculty
members that my grade-point
average, my major. and the {act
that I have taken fewer classes in
my major than students at other
types of colleges are not going to
aiiect my iuture. Though i might
start but lower on the ladder of life,
my superior liberal education is
going to pull me to the top in no
time. Well. dear proiessors, listen
to your own words. Maybe the 372
program will make Grinnell irom
the outside appear to be a better
college. Perhaps we will become
number nine again, or. with the
new computerized card-catalog
system in the library, ive will make
that heady jump to eight. Though
we students might beneiit from
this in the short run. by starting out
a little higher on this ladder. in the
long run. due to our now worsened
education. we will be screwed,
Though more laculty research at
Grinnell might heighten our image
a little, it will mainly serve to
heighten the faculty's egos.

Again I would like to state that I
don't hold this against the iaculty.
Most proiessors did not enter the
academic world because of a love
or teaching, but because they
wanted to do research, But for
them to try to pass the 3-2 program
over on the students as beneficial
to Grinnell is insulting. I saw the
smiles on the professors' iaces in
the picture in the s and B as they
voted ior the 372 program. Those
were not “Geeswe'revdoingrthisr
lur-the-college" smiles. They were
"Geeplehave»tosspend-less-time-
withstudents” smiles. I want to
commend Prolessor Parslow for
coming out and calling the pro-
gram what it is‘ a selfserving
move ior the laculty with no
foreseeable benefits to the educa-
tion offered at this college. As for
the rest oi the iaculty, I don't ex-
pect sainthood irom my proA
fessors. If I did, I would have gone
to divinity school. I do, however,
think the proiessors who voted for
the 3-2 program could have had
enough respect lor the intelligence
of the students to come right out
and state why they voted ior the
program: to have more time to ad
vance their own careers. whether
or not this vote would have a good
or bad effect on the students of this
college. 7 Erica Wcitio, 'llll

there is. But classics gives me a lot
oi personal pleasure and l enjoy
the subject, And it's not totally
useless because I'm learning to
think. write, and express myself
well." Brown says the
smorgasbord oi courses oiiered
each semester makes it difficult to
choose a course load. “There's just
so much out there. My problem is
that i can never take enough oi
what I want. With all the different
areas developing. you have so
many options." says Brown.
Brown says she is glad Grinnell
does not have specific course re-
quirements because she believes it
would lower academic standards.
"The college would have to offer
math alld English classes that
everyone can pass, I‘ve seen this at
other schools I've visited.” Brown
concedes that there is a minority of
students who abuse the open curs
riculum. but she points out that
those students have to pay the con-
sequences, “A student can choose
not to get a good liberalarts educa
tion. but that is his choice and he'll
have to accept that his education is
deiioient. The college trusts us
enough to let us make our own
choices about our education."

"on".

Senior Eric Schneider, an
economics major irom Wilmette.
Illinois, says that a liberalvarts
education for him means
"teaching me through courses that
interest me. I'm not interested in
classics and if I was forced to |ake
it i wouldn't enjoy it.” Schneider
recounts how he took Intro to
Philosophy and found it worthless.
"1 did the readings but i just
couldn't understand the logic. and
I wasn‘t interested enough to ask
questions, i read Descartes and
Plate and Just went on." Although
he did take several math courses.
Schneider says he managed to
avoid his nemesis, laboratory
science, “With the open cur-
riculum I thought I wouldn't have
to take lab science. My adviser
pressured me to take science but i
didn't Want to take something I
wasn‘t good at.” Nevertheless,
Schneider believes he got a good
liberal-arts education. “I took a lot
at Spanish, math. and religious
studies. I think that what was most
valuable was that 1 improved my
writing skills. -l also improved my
communication skills. I just didn’t
do it through taking all the
classes."

Dave. a sophomore political
science major, believes that many
students are attracted to Grinnell
because they won't have to take re»
quired courses. He admits that he
came to Grinnell intending not to
take math or science, “I've noticed
that many Grinnell students are
reluctant to take a wide range of
courses. it is really a contradiction
because students are very goal-
oriented. yet they are coming here
where you are supposed to take a
lot of different courses. I think
there are a lot of students here who
are very closerminded about the
courses they'll take. I came here
close»minded. but I realize that I
will take some math and science
because i know now that they're a
lot more interesting in college than
In high school." Dave believes that
the iuture will bring some type oi
curriculum changes. “it‘s his
evitable. But you can't blame the
college for the students it attracts
and you can't blame students ior
having clear goals about their
education.” he says.

Brian Strause. a probable
English/art major . from
Cleveland. Ohio' states that Grin-
nell is lacking in its fine-arts
department and is channeling
money into the sciences at the ex
pense or the humanities. “Grinnell
is selling out." says Strause,
"They just built that new science
building and they are putting their
money into selence. They expect to
get money from science alumns,
not ones in the fine arts.” Strause
asserts that the college is attemp-
ting to “keep up with the Joneses.’
”They're talking about implemen-
ting a core curriculum just to be
more marketable. li they‘re going
to make Grinnell like Carleton, I
should have gone there in the first
place. I don't want to be forced to
take courses I don't like. If I'm
forced to take a course. I won't
remember anything about it two
days after I've taken a test. Sure, a
iew people slip through. but the
whole system shouldn't be changed
because of them. I really feel
strongly that the open curriculum
should stay the way it is," states
Strause,
