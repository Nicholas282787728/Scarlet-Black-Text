TllE LINEUP FOR BREAK . , some
would claim, is better than the offerings
when we're all on campus. A wide array oi
films will be offered, the best of which is
the American classic From Here to Eterni-
ty (I954, 118 miriS.), Based on James
Jones’ novel, the film deals with the intert-
wined lives oi five people a iew days beiore
the bombing oi Pearl Harbor; a story oi
hard military men and their petty
rivalries. The Cast. is superb with some of
the biggest names or the time: Burt Lan-
caster, Montgomery Cliit, Deborah Kerr,
Frank Sinatra (AA) and Donna Reed
(AA). The two primary stories follow Clift
and Lancaster, two moral men in an
amoral world expressing their integrity in
different ways; one in rebellion against
society and the system, the other by at
tempting to correct it irom the inside This
film won eight academy awards (of which
Best Picture was one) and Sinatra's porn
irayal oi Maggio marked the beginning oi
his career comeback, Deiinitely a movie
worth seeing. BeSldes, how could anyone
miss their chance to see the famous
”steamy" beach scene between Kerr and
Lancaster as the waves crash around them
and Kerr utters the immortal words. “I
never knew it could be like this'"
ANOTHER FlFTlES FILM . . though not
quite of the same Caliber, is John Ford's
Mogambo tress, 115 mins >. Though lack-
ing the steam oi the original, this remake
of the Gablerl-larlow Classic lied Dust
(19327 Still provides some entertainment
Gable repeats his role as a big game
hunter caught in a love triangle with two
women, the worldly-wise Ava Gardner and
the ice princess lmarried to boot) Grace
Kelly. Though every one loves Princess
Grace, you'll tind yourseli rooting ior Ava
Gardner in this one. Though filled with
ageold cliches and stereotypes, the iilm is
nevertheless a diverting piece oi celluloid.
It's amazing how well Gable held up over
the years,
IF YOU LIKE SCI‘FI .. then the film for
you is The Andromeda Strain (19“. 130
mlns ). One of the finer science fiction
films of the "103, this tale is based on the
popular novel by Michael Crichton. A
remote spot in New Mexico is con-
taminated when a satellite crashes. There,
a team oi four top scientists iight time try-
ing to analyze the lethal organism and
discover a solution, A very interesting and
ihroughly Captivating movie which has a
thoughtiul message.

0N II LIGHTER NOTE , , , Herbert
ROSS'S Seven Percent Solution (1976, 113
mins) This film is nothing more than a
completely enjoyable lark, What would
have happened if Sherlock Homes met up
with Sigmund Freudl Well, undoubtedly, a
rather droll Freud (Alan Arkin) would
have cured the drug ridde'n sleuth (Nicol
Williamson) of his fondness for Cocaine. In
turn, Holmes woul have solved the
mystery or one oi Freud's patients. with
its elegant plot, this stylish exercise in
whimSlcal speculation works well The
rest of the cast, Robert Duvall, Laurence
Olivier, Joel Grey and Vanessa Redgrave,
is excellent making the film fun-filed fluff.
ANOTHER AMUSING PIECE . . t 15
Elaine May‘s A New Leaf (1971. 102 mins).
Miss May. wrote, directed and starred in
this delightful film whose inventiveness
keeps a person smiling throughout, Walter
Matmau plays a sly snob who’s bankrupt
and looking for a rich wuman to marry
within six weeks. He finds Miss May, a
rich botonist and a confirmed klutz, The
predictable love and laughs ensue but it's
all in the proper Spirit, Miss May's direcA
tion, though slightly askcw, is periect ior
this fun loving film.

From the Committee on Buffer Days

To the Editor:

This is the text oi the proposal that the
Committee on Buffer Days will submit to
the Committee on Academic Standing:

on behalf of the students of Grinnell Col-
lege, we present this proposal ior your con-
sideration.

Our immediate goal is to obtain a temr
porary modiiicaiion in the academic
calendar for 1983784, The specific change
called for is a one day addition to the hufs
ier period in both the tall and spring
semesters.

We ieel that the present academic calen-
clar does not proVide an adequate amount
oi time ior students to prepare ior iinal ex-
ams, The current buffer period, limited to
two days, exacerbates the intense
academic pressure A one day addition
would allow the students an opportunity
for a more thorough and relaxed preparar
tion as well as Valuable time for the cams
pletion of written assignments,

Fall Semester

Consuierlng the stipulations listed in the
Academic Calendar Committee's report,
we feel that the most likely posSlbillty for a
modification would be the addition of a
Saturday exam period in exchange ior a
Monday buffer day. This will preserve the
14 week class schedule and is a better
alternative than shortening the Thanksgivr
mg Break.

For the year in question, such an ex7 ,

change will move the iinal day or exams
irom the 18th to the 19th oi December and
should create no extra inconvenience in
closing out the iall semester,

Spring Semester

The proposed modification in the spring
semester is a shift to a Tuesday through
Saturday exam schedule as in the fall
semester, which necessitates holding com-
mencement ceremonies on a Tuesday.

The concern for the inconvenience to the
parents of the graduating Students should
not. in our opinion. outweigh the value of
an extra day oi study to students in all four
classes.

We have polled a great number oi
students, and their support tor the pro
posal was nearly unanimous. and a
unanimous SGA vote 'oi approval sups
plements the opinion. We ieel that our pro
posed Changes do not jeopardize the
conditions provided ior by the calendar
guidelines passed by iaculty vote last Sprr
ing, In addition, our proposal answers a
pressing student need ior time to ader
quately draw together and conclude an en»
tire semester of work Again, the benefits
resulting {rpm the extra day would accrue
to both students and proiessors

Thus, the weight or our argument lies in
the numbers oi those who gain; any
disagreement with our proposal must not
overlook the importance oi its acceptance
to the college as a whole

Thank you ior your consideration. 7
Sincerely, Jane Brown, Jim Rabchuk, Dan .
Nissenbaum and Gautam Ghosh, 7 As a
footnote, we wish to thank all the students
who have supported our eiiort. and ask
everyone to continue to express their Dpi~
nion to the iaculty and administration
