Hunger conference speakers discuss solutions

by Peter Small

A conlerence at Grinnell last
week on funding World lliinger-
The Iowa Connection was. while
poorly advertised. very well run
and provocative.

At the seminar were discussed
some of the possible actions, on
both the national and local level.
which US. Citizens can take in
order to contribute to the effort to
eliminate hunger, The overiding
philosophy of the conierence was
that it is possible, and ultimately
beneficial to all involved. to pro-
vide food aid and economic aid to
developing nations in such a way
that they can soengthen their
agricultural and economic self-
sufficiency.

Among die events at the sym-
posium was a meeting of
representatives from various
church organizations in lowa that
are concerned with the problem of
hunger. it was encouraging to see
how many different types oi
organizations there are at a grass-

roots level,

These organizations are involv-
ed in creative programs designed
to address specific development
and food relief problems One
such group is Heifer Project Inter
national. which was founded by a
group of Methodists in 1944. The
organization donates livestock to
larm groups in developing nations
so that they can develop livestock
herds of their own.

Another group. CROP. has held
walks, fasts and other activities to
raise money to go to church
organizations concerned with
Third World development as well
as directly to agricultural
development and emergency
relief projects.

Another form oi development
aid is foreign aid given by the 11.5.
government to developing na-
tions. Daniel shaugnessy, a
speaker at the seminar. noted how
foreign aid is generally unpopular
among the American people
because it is oiten depicted as a
handout to undeserving nations.

Abortion: an opposing
view is presented

by ‘llen lirookc

In response to Proicssor Dan
Magurshak's pro-abortion discus
sion earlier this semester. a group
ol students asked prorlife sup
porter Rosalind Gessler to present
the pro»lile platlorin to Grills
nelllans

Beginning her lecture beiore a
crowded South Lounge audience
on Tuesday. she claimed that the
general public has lorgottcn the
meanings of the words abortion.
fetus. conception. and related
words through their excessive use
by the media. Through the use or a
well-organized slide show she
presented the “pro-life“ View»
point.

The main focus of her lecture
was the presentation oi medical
iacts used to answer the question.
"Is what is killed in abortion
human life?" This country's legal
system has attempted to answer
this by dividing the nine months oi
pregnancy into three trimesters.
with abortions being readily
available during the first two of
these three sections. and 0b,
tainable during the third if the
mother's health is in danger

To prove that the lotus is a
human liic throughout the com
plete period oi pregnancy. Mrs,
Gressler showed four slides of
prematurely born babies who
have survived. All four were born
within [B to 21 weeks after concep-
lion. or the second trimester.

Along with the Slides Mrs.
Gessler iliformed the audience
that at eleven and oneshalf weeks
old. still in the first trimester. all
the human systems are functionr
ing. The fetus is lasting. eating.
breathing. and it is sensitive to
pain. she said. Earlier than this
by a weeks. the skeletal structure
has formed. the eyes are open.
and the hands and feet are
developing.

Because oi the "amazing pro
cess of fertilization”. Gessler said
that lrom day one a unique human
life begins. Upon fusion of the
male and female chromosomes.
“nothing else needs to be added to
this sytstcm besides nutrition to
create a human being." she said,

Gessler argued that since brain
waves can be picked up lrom a six
week old .ietjus;. . ._should be
declared humanly alive: She also

' depicting the .poverly-sti

contested the argument that
because it is dependent on its
mother ior lilesupport, a fetus is
not a human being.

Although not Selfssllpportlvc.
elderly Americans unable to live
without outside help are con
sidercu to be human she said. in
another analogy. a picture of an
astronaut. dependent on his life
support system was projected one
to the screen,

once the medical facts are
presented in an attempt lo pers
suade her audience that an abor-

tion is the killing of a human life.

she discussed social and political
reasons why abortions should be
opposed

Referring to one ol the most
common pro-abortion arguments.
that oi the rape victims right to
an abortion Gcssler asked
rhetorically hould We kill an in-
nocent baby ior the crimes of the
father?" She Said that not only is
this considered to be a Violent
reaction to a violent crime. but it
legalizes the concept ol the
stronger dominating the weaker
and this violates the unborn
baby's civil rights

When asked if she had ever
come in contact wltli a woman
preganaiit through rape. she
replied negatively. but added that
"double violence won't solve the
question. . the trauma oi abortion
on top oi the trauma or rape could
finish her. What she really needs
is tenderness. compassion. and
expert medical and psychological
care. not a hit-and-run abortion."

The question of the right to an
abortion ior rape Victims is not
given much importance by pro-
abortionists. according to
Gcssler. because of the low rate of
rapes resulting in pregnancies;
3.5 thousand rapes over to years
in a metropolitan area. with no
resulting pregnancies. was a
statistic she cited.

Before showing her series oi
graphic pictures of aborted
babies. she refuted the contention
that pro-llfers draw their support
through these highly emotional
pictures Claiming that they are
not the only people to present hora
rid pictui es to espouse their
cause. she presented a picture

Shaugnessy. a former employee
of the Us. foreign ald office who
now owns a company concerned
widi the export ol technology to
developing nations. stated that not
only is diis a cold-hearted ate
titude. it is incorrect.

He argued that economically it
is more to our benefit to create
employment through the process
ing and shipment oi grain man it
is to let surplus grain sit in
elevators. He also made the point
that it is better for us to have
politically and economically
stable trading partners and that
our food aid can buy the time
needed to create better conditions
in our nations.

As an example he cited lndia.
where ior a two year period the
us donated heavy amounts oi
food aid so diat they could develop
their own agricultural production.
Shaugnessy believes that the food
aid allowed iarmers and the
government to divert resources
ior long term agricultural

development rather than use
those resources for immediate
needs. According to Shaugnessy.
India’s agricultural output in
creased significantly after this
period.

An important theme in the
speeches at this seminar was that
of global inter-dependance. Bath
Dr. Moyer and Martin
McLaughlin noted that our pre-
sent world view tends to be very
adversarial rather than
cooperative. This makes it very
difficult for us as individials and
for the nation as a whole to re
orient our priorities to an attitude
which allows us to share more
freely and creatively the
resources that we have at our
command.

The overall impression
gathered from the seminar is that
there are direct. positive actions
that we as individuals and as a has
tion can take to aid other couns
tries in their struggle to eliminate
hunger.

say the course is adulterated. . .
We [the foreign language faculty]
just don’t cutout people."

Robert Cadmus. assistant pres
lessor oi Physics. expressed amr
bivalence, saying. "I think it
we're going to have requirements
it‘s hard to see them conSlstent
without it [a foreign language re
quirement]. . . It's important ior
students to have choices. If lt is
true that the languages are fun»
damentally similar. there is a loss
of ilcxibility. ll not. the laiiugage
requirement ollers a range."

Referring to the Parslow Pros
posal's social studies require
ment. Parker proiessor ol History
Alan Jones said. “Requirements
are suggested that have no
speciiic purpose."

Peter Connelly. professor oi
English. challenged the Jones
Proposals solution saying that.

"If the prerequisites are within
the department. then the same
thing will occur [as would the
Parsiow Proposal illelt unamend
ed],“

in defense of the Jones Proposal
recommendations Randolph
Roth. assistant professor of
History. stated. "The second
course lin a twocoursc required
sequence] transcends
disciplinary bounds He's [Jones]
trying to put some innovation into
this Curriculum "

The question cl stalling ll‘l’lpllcar
lions was again raised

Liahna Babener, associate pro
lessor of American Studies and
English. stated. "I'm not comfors
table with it [the proposed amend
mentl. I know that teaching inter-
disciplinary courses is not easy.
These are . . compelling topics
Retoolillg would be major."

The Humanities Division
amendment also met debate. Pros

lessor of Theatre Alexander Mof~
felt said, "I think that the main
reservation of the original
lParslow Proposal] was that it
didn't lencompassl modern
works,"

Again the question of staffing
implications was raised. Phil
Kininer. Rosenlhal professor oi
l-luinanities. responded. “We
eltllei' act on faith or we don't act
on faith." in predicting the
trustees' reactions to faculty
demands for more proiessors.

tlne item on the agenda that was
not debated was the announce-
ment that Daniel Kaiseri assistant
proiessor oi History. was named
Rosenfleld Professor of Social
Studies.

Vote on Parslo“ Proposal

The faculty vote on the Parslow
Proposal will most probably be at
next Monday's meeting. once all
debate on amelidments has been
completed.

Claiming that women are not
completely inlormed about their
unborn babies and the physical
alter effects abortions may have.
Gessler criticized a part of the
proschmce platform. Twenty-live
percent oi women who have had
an abortion have contracted
either inlections or excessive
bleeding which can beserious. she
said.

The mother's choice is limited
by the restrictions society has

abortion is made illegal, the
mother won't be iorced to raise a
child. which could be a burden. as
there is always the option oi adopr
tion. and “lots and lots or people
are waiting to adopt babies." she
noted.

Gessler's lecture ended on a

cluded that they are lhesame type
