Successful
investment
spawns long '
range plans

by Dave tones

The apparent success of an
investment made two years ago
by the Grinncll College Board of
Trustees has caused the college to
begin efforts to set long-range
planning goals.

President George Drake has
appointed a task force composed
of 11 faculty, four students, five
administrators, three trustees and
three alumni to map out, in very
general terms, the course the
college will take if the
investment shows the expected
substantial proﬁt.

At the request of Trustee Joe
Rosenfield. in 1986 the Board
made a seven million dollar in-
vestment in a paper container
company which eventually
became Gaylord Container
Company. Rosenfield had been
informed of the prudence of the
investment by Marvin Pomer-
antz, a Des Moines entrepreneur
who was leading a takeover of
part of the industry.

Unlike most of the Board's
holdings, the Gaylord Container
investment was very risky.

"We could have test every-
thing," said Drakel "But the
feeling of the Board was the
endowment is large enough that
we can afford to take this kind of
risk."

In May, Gaylord Container
made a public offering of its
stock which allowed Grinncll to
recover its initial investment.
The college now owns 3.8
million shares. 21 percent, of
Gaylord which is a Fortune 500
company.

While the Gaylord stock adds
a value of about 40745 million
dollars to the Grinncll College
endowment, Drake is quick to
note that none of that value is
usable income, It will be at least
one or two years before the
college realizes any actual-money
proﬁts from the company

"The Board is afraid that
people will think that the mon-
ey‘s here and want to spend it...
and it‘s just not here," Drake said.

But it is that potential
windfall that led Drake to
appointment the ”Task Force on
the Future," in an attempt to
"make the very best use of this in
planned ways."

While long-range planning
has been done before at Grinnell,
Drake's task force is the ﬁrst at-
tempt at a community-wide
planning process. ‘ '

Incidents of harassment

tnCIte campus concerns

by Jessica Weisel

Baausc of n recent rape in
town and numerous cases of sex-
ual harassment, Grinnell College
students and administrators are
rcevaluating campus procedures
and policies.

The rape occurred Friday,
Sept. 2 in the 1800 block of
Penrose SL, as a Grinnelt woman
walked alone at 9:30 pm. in the

from behind.

contained information about what
to do if a person has been
assaulted.

But the rope also brought to
light numerous incidents
involving student harassment, on
and off campus. Erika Spicgel
said, "Often when you walk into
town alone or with one female
friend, chances are some car will
slow down and the guys inside
will call to you."

 

 

 

The Student Affairs Office
mailed a letter to all students
containing a description of the
attacker and advised students,
especially women. to avoid
walking alone in dimly lit,
unpopulated areas Students were
also advised to take refuge in a lit
house if they felt they were being
followed. The flier also

Questions

The 1988-89 first semester
enrollment report reveals a total
of 1238 full-time degree/non-
degree students on campus, an
addition of 43 students compared
with the 1987-88 fall semester
total of 1245. This increase. as
well as the faculty—supponed 3.2
program, may be the cause of
several "overcrowded" closes.
The 3-2 program
implemented last year, enables
faculty members to teach three
courses one semester, two the
other. This reduction allows for
extra research, scholarship, and
the "maintenance of the high
quality or the faculty," said Dean
of the Faculty Charles Duke.
According to Registrar Roger
Lasley, there are always minor
ongoing difficulties with over
crowded classes, and there were
no new substantial problems this
semester. "We looked over the
statistics prior to registration, arid
uiere was enough planning so
that the number of class sections
virtually did not change," Lasley
mid.

Although some course
sections were added before and
during registration, the number of
entry level courses is essentially-
the same as in previous years.
said Duke.

Freshman tutorial professors
did not mention problems with
registering the 370 freshmen into

Laura Leuchtag is a recent
victim of harassment. At
midnight on Saturday, Sept. 3,
she was screamed at from a
passing car. The car, which she
described as "large and maroon,"
slowed down as it approached her.
She tumed down a one»way street
so it couldn't follow, but "then I
realized that they would probably

circle around to harass me, so I
rari back through some buildings
and back home. ljusl basically
wanted to avoid any confronlar
lion."

Dean of Students Tom Crudy
urged students to report cases of
harassment and sexual assault.
"Any incident like that, we need
to know about, because we
communicate that to the police.
oftentimes, a lot of harassment
situations . go unreported.
And we really have no way of
knowing what‘s going on. The
police are very responsive in
trying to help us deal with this
situation and panelling the area"

Student Affairs deﬁnes ha-
rassment as "any verbal or
physical conduct which: (1) has
the purpose or effect or creating
an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working or educational
environment: (2) has the purpose
or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's
work or academic performance; or

(3) otherwise adversely effccB an
individual‘s employment or
academic opportunities."

Sexual harassment "is predi»
cared not on gender but upon sex
or sexual relations vis»n-vis the
person to whom it is directed."
The person reporting the incident
must decide whether a situation is
a case of harassment, and must
then choose how far they wish to
pursue the matter in Student Af-
fairs. information about harass-
merit may be obtained from the
Student Affairs Ofﬁce. This in
formation, though, only includes
the details for pursuing matters
when both parties are students.

Julie Slivinsky was harassed
Saturday night outside of
Younker Hall as she and a friend
returned from Iowa City late at
night. when a "big. old. white car
turned on its brights and stopped
right behind us. They stayed
there, and no one was getting out
of the car and we thought they

remain about "overcrowding"

 

Are classes overcrowded? Many students say yes, but most faculty say no.

the classes of their choice.
"None of my freshmen had any
trouble getting the classes they
wanted, " said Al Jones.

Some professors expressed
surprise. "I advised my students
to run across the gymnasium and
leap over the tables, but surpris-
ingly enough, all my freshmen
got the classes they signed up
for, " said Brad Batcman.

However, many students said
their classes are overcrowded,
speciﬁcally in the psychology
department and ZOO-level English
classes.

"My class is a lecture. so
there isn‘t really any discussion.

But there are so‘many people that

if we had to interact with each
other it would be ridiculous," said
a physio—psych student.

The psychology department is
facultyracknowledged as one of
the most crowded every semester,
as well as one of the ﬁrst to close
early at registration. According
to General Science department
chairman Brozoski. lOO-and 200.
level psychology classes are
somewhat larger than the depart-
ment would like. "We‘d like our
classes about 30% smaller if we
could," he said. Although there is
an average of 40 students per
class right now, Brozoski would
prefer an avelage between 20 and
30.

The English department
opened an extra English 107
section during registration.
English department chairman
Cavanaugh said that there has
always been a demand for the
course. "Generally speaking,
there isn't a problem with
overcrowding," Cavanaugh said.

Yet some ZOO-level English
students complain of overly»large
classcsl "My class is fairly large,
and it kind of prevents any type
of discussion," said a "Traditions
of English Literature" student

The fall 1988-89 class
enrollment statistics are not yet
available.
