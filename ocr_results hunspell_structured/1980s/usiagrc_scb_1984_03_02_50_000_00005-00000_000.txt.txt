To the Editor:

In a recent article concerning
the evaluation of faculty (“Facul-
ty discuss measuring excellence,"
February 24), your reporter Jane
Kaufman misquoted me and gave
an inaccurate representation oi
my views on quantitative and non-
quantitative methods.

Speciﬁcally, I did not say that
“nonquantitative data don’t have
to be precise"; I said that non-
quantitative evaluations need not
be imprecise. For the record, my
opinion is that prose descriptions
at a faculty members abilities,
strengths, and weaknesses give a
more accurate and more reliable
basis for evaluation than such
quantitative data as number at
publications, average score on
student evalution forms, and
amounts oi grant money received,

of course. it takes an evaluator
who is intelligent. or at least
literate, to produce accurate pro
se evaluations. and they have no
value unless the relevant
authorities have the time and par
tience to read them carefully.
This is why quantitative measure
are more useful in bureaucracies.
as a sort of rough-and-ready
substitute for thoughtful attention
to individual differences.

My view is that since Grinnell
has plenty oi people who can read

well and write well. and who can .

take the time to study individual
cases in some detail, quantitative
measure should not be seen as
sell-contained proois oi the degree
of excellence of an institution or of
a person. Although quantitative
data often constitute relevant
evidence. such evidence must be
fitted into an argument that is fun-
damentally nonrquantltative.

Three final points, to forestall
iurther misunderstandings: (1) l
have precisely the same qualms
about evaluating students by
graderpoint averages, and would
like to see letter grades become
mere adjuncts to prose
evalutaions. 12) I do not claim
that non-quantimtive methods of
evaluation always yield the core
rect results. only that they are
more trustworthy than purely
quantitative methods, in this par-
ticular area (3) The above
remarks do not contradict, and in
iact should be taken to support.
the proposition that statistical
theory is one of die subjects that
make up a liberal education. At
the very least, it helps one to
distinguish the questions that
statistics can answer from those it
cannot, and to distinguish
statistics that might contribute to
the solution oi a problem irom
those that have any a specious
relevance, — John David Stone

A View
of the
controversy

To the Editor:

For several weeks I have been
reading about the controversy
brewing over the selection oi a
qualified candidate for the posir
tion of Professor of Afro-
American Literature, and I now
ieel compelled to write to vine
dicate Dr. James Kissane‘s
stance on the issue.

Erudite AND sensitive, Kissane
is a paragon oi unimpeachable inr
tegrity and equitableness. l-lis
stance is the result of what he
believes to be the most beneficial
move for all those concerned, both
white and black, I do not question
the sincerity of those who have so
sedulously propagated misap-
prehensions about Kissane; lonly
wish they would have used more
objectivity in iorming their opir
nions. There are two important
points that must be emphasized ii
one is to understand why Kissane
acted as he did,

Firstly, it is time that we realize
what the idea behind “affirmative
action” is. Simply stated, the idea
is this: we should allow minorities
into positions for which they are
not always qualiiied so that we
might appease that portion oi the
population. it is wellrknown (and
documented). for example. that
minority students at selective col-
leges are. ‘on the average. not as
well-qualified to attend mose col~
leges as the attending white
students, One may argue with this
statement all he wishes;but argu-
ment will not change this iact,
which is irrelragable.

There are, oi course, other fac
tors in the selection process that
may contribute to the success oi
an individual in college (or other
positions, ior that matter), but
these factors are not as important
as the main factor 7 ability. Even
if the point that minorities usually
have iewer opportunities than
Whites to better themselves is
broached, it must be remembered
that this point does not change the
iact that minorities are generally
less qualified, Certainly we should
work to make sure that minorities
have the same opportunities as
whites, but giving jobs to those
who are not as qualifed as others
is no solution.

Secondly, I wish to point out
what I believe to be a serious
mistake on the part of President
Drake By not emphasizing the
importance oi selecting the best
available candidate, and by em-
phasizing only the importance of
selecting the best available
BLACK candidate. Drake is in efr
fect saying that excellence isn't as
important at Grinnell as appease-
ment. It seems to me that this
kind of appeasement will only exr
acerbate the polarization oi the
two races that has been continual
for over 300 years. Although some
students and administrators do

not agree with me on this point. i
wonder what other students (both
black and white) who have not
publicly expressed their opinions
think about the matter, I have
talked to several, and I find that
many consider the college's policy
to be an instance of reverse
discrimination, as Dr. Kissane
pointed out.

Being born black doesn't give
one an inherent understanding of
Afro-American literature any
more than being born white docs,
and it is ludicrous to assume that
a person's skin color, by itseli, can
have any effect on his abiltiy to
perceive the world around him.
No one makes any objections to
blacks teaching English literature
or other areas in which the main
body of the material to be studied
was written by whites; why
should anyone care whether a
white teaches literature written
by blacks? One may argue that a
black has more understanding of
oppression (and its significance in
literature) than, say, a white, but
remember that many white pear
pie (among them, the lrish, the
Germans, the Russians, and the
Jews) also suffered great
degradations Certainly they can
idcntiiy with suiiering and sorrow
as much or more than a black per»
son can,

Not all minority groups have
suiiered greatly. either Anglo-

Saxon Protestants have also
undergone a great deal or travail,
for that matter. Thus. this point,
were it to be made, is nugatory
and there is no reason to believe
that a black person could do a bet
ter job than a white person in the
canacitv of Professor, of Afro-
American Literature Similarly
the point that only blacks can
understand their culture is equal-
ly baseless, and (or me same
reasons. ii an lrish proiessor can
teach German literature, why
can’t a white professor (of
whatever nationality) teach Afro-
American literature? Some Grin-
nellians. however, seem to think
that nonrblack people cannot
understand black Culture, and
their myopia cannot be ignored.
This myopia will be propagated as
long as the search for a black pro-
fessor continues.

Now, it may work, There is no
reason to believe that the English
department will not iind eventual-
ly a qualified candidate who is
black. Even if it doesn't. however.
there will be a point that is being
missed sorely by many oi those in-
volved in or concerned with the
issue As Dr. Kissane pointed out,
a candidate’s eligibility tor the
position should not be based upon
his skin color but upon his
qualifications ior that positio .
What it comes down to is thi

shall we chooseacandidate who is

less qualified (and black) for the
position so that we might appease
a special interest group on cam-
pus (for that is What the faction of
black students is), or shall we
choose the best candidate (white.
black, Chinese » it doesn't mat-
ter) to make the school better as a
whole? We will have racial unr
l'airnesses on this campus as long
as this administration kowtows to
such iactions. only by eliminating
such biases can we extii-paie all
racism eiiectively.

It must not be assumed that
black students are the only ones
who would take the course In Afro~
American literature; White
students would take the course,
too, so why must only black
students' opinions on candidates
be solicitated‘? I disdane to drape
grim reality with pretty phrases.
We are faced with a hard, ineluc-
table fact. Unless all of us unite
(all races. religions, and
temperaments) soon and husband
our talents and energies for
something that will prove
beneficial to us all. the racial
polarity which has been
heretofore lneradlcable will cons
tinue, and multipolarlty may spr»
ing up in its stead We cannot
palliate racial tensions and unr
iairnesses by basing a
candidates's eligibility for a posi-
tion upon his skin color and not
upon his qualiiications, ~ Todd

A Christian examines abortion

by Matt Reames

i believe in the sanctity oi
human life. Abortions destroy
human life. Thus abortion is difs
ferent from birth control which
prevents a new life from beginn~
ing, There are many questions
related to abortion; there is hard-
ly room here to begin to discuss
them all, Inside every pregnant
woman is a ietus, which means
“little person” in Latin. I would
like to explain why i, as a human
being and as a Christian. consider
a fetus to be fully human

First, let's look at the develop
ment of the baby lnsxde the womb
during pregnancy. The baby’s
heart begins to beat two to three
weeks after conception, By uie
first monﬂi most of the new baby’s
organs have started to form.
When five weeks old, the little one
can move his arms and legs.
Fortyrfive days after conception,
brain waves can be picked up
from the baby inside the mother.
By die end of the second month of
pregnancy, the baby can squint,
swallow, and move his tongue.
After ten weeks, the infant has sex
hormones, finger nails, is able to
suck his thumbI and recoils from
pain. His/her fingerprints, on the
hands already formed, will never
change diroughout his/her life ex
cept for size.

in the iourth month, die grow-
ing baby is eight to ten inches
long. During the filth month, skin,
hair, and nails grow, sweat and oil

glands begin to function. The
mother feels her infant's
movements for the first time, In
the sixth month of pregnancy, the
baby responds to light and sound.
He gets hiccups, can hear the beat
of his mother’s heart, and can
sleep and awaken. Survival out-
side the womb is now possible.
The iniant continues to grow gain
ing stature and weight. Aiter con
ception, everything necessary for
a new human life to grow and
develop is present. I cannot iind
any point during pregnancy that a
fetus suddenly becomes human.

What does the Bible say about
when life begins? In the 01d Testa-
ment, God makes it plain that He
knows human beings before they
leave their mothers' wombs:
“For Thou [God] didst form my
inward parts, thou didst knit
togeﬂier in my mothers’s womb.”
(Psalm 139.I3) ”NOW the Word of
the Lord come to me, saying
‘Before I formed you [Jeremiahl
in die womb l knew you, and
beiore you were born 1 con-
secrated you; I appointed you a
prophet to the nations’ " (Jere
mian 114-5) Whether one takes
these words figuratively or literal-
ly does not matter. God treaB
babies inside the womb as people
full of potential. He does not con-
sider them hali- human or sub-
human in any way.

In the New Testament, the
angel declared to Mary, “Behold,

ou will conceive in your womb

Until a. but not out,

mild l ark «for on. emit ‘

and bear a son. and you shall call
Him Jesus. He will be great and
Will be called the Son of the Most
High...” tLuke 1:31-32) Therefore,
God is concerned about the pur-
pose of a person's life while he is
still inside his mother’s womb.
God does not wait until after a per
son is born to determine his or her
worth,

Sometimes, i hear the argu-
ment that a person is not a human
being until he or she has a unique
contribution to offer the world.
The same people argue against
the ietus being a iull person
because the infant cannot survive
on i5 own, This would mean that
all babies born stand trial until
they, for concrete, deiinable
reasons, can live independently
without the care of other people
and are making a contribution to
the world.

Every man and woman alive to-
day is distinctly different. There
will never be another person like
you or the baby aborted a iew
minutes ago. Since every person
is unique, the purpose oi every
human beings life is unique as
well. By allowing abortions, peo»
ple are losing a large part of
humanity. Who can count the cost
of the loss of one million lives each
year in the United States alone“
Every ietus is a liie Every one oi
them aborted is a human being
that was not allowed to live
because of another person's deciv
sion.
