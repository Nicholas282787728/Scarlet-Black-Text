The Barber in review

by Steve Mondscheln

Last Fnday night the Goldovsky
Grand Opera Theatre presented Gioac~
chino Rossinl's comic opera, "The
Barber of Seville.” Arturo Delmoni
conducted, substituting lor the ill Boris
Goldovsky.

“The Barber of Sevrlle" premiered at
the Argentina Theater in Rome in 1816
when Rossini was just 23 years old.
Paislello's opera on the same subjectas

"The Barber oi Seville,” had been pro. _

duced as early as 1782 and was Still
enormously popular at the time that
Rossinl's version appeared. Partially
as a result 01 Paisello's success, the
opening performance of the opera, con-
ducted by Rossini, was hissed at and
generally very poorly received. The
next performance was a hit and
became one or Rossini's greatest suc-
cesses.

Goldovsky, a renowned ligure in the
world or opera, is responsible lor many
innovations ln the art today The belief
in the periormer as a singer-actor is
one innovation that was obvious during
the pertormance.

The most accomplished singersactor
oi the production was William McGraw

Hi the role of Figaro His diction and ap-
pealing acting capabilities cams
plemented his excellent voice. David
Midboe as Dr. Barmlo and Lawrence
Vincent as Count Almaviva also gave
good performances.

Lack or consistency plagued Daisy

Newman's perlormance as the flir-'

tatious and conniving Rosina, She was
effective when she “belted out" her
lines, but other times her projection
was poor with the voice thinning con-
siderably at the top. Don Basilio, the
greedy music master, portrayed by
Richard Crist, was adequate in his role
although his diction was not always
clear.

The orchestra's pertormance ranged
lrom fair to poor. The quality of sound
was untortunatoly often too min and
scratchy. The VioiinS, who also had
trouble with intonation, were the main
culprits.

The production was a good, but not
great, performance Almost all the cast
was under the age 0135,2nergetic, and
displayed a fresh demeanor to be ex
pected from young professionals to
whom opera is not yet “old hat."
