right now, as you are reading
this, there is probably a Grinncl-
lian swimming his heart out in
Cedar Rapids.

Certainly, they are ready for
it. The energy level in the PEC
pool during Wednesday night‘s
practice was frightening If these
guys didn‘t find an outlet the
campus would have been over-
whelmed by hyperactive bald
men. That‘s right, bald.

The swimmers shaved their
heads and bodies Wednesday night
in preparation for conference so

coach Sheila Cain was quick to
point out how well the women
swam. Besides the six individual
wins, the women set three school
records,

clocking in at 1:07.24. and shavn
ing .16 off the old record. The
200 free relay team of Shannon

Trim, and Furnish took just over
two seconds 011 the old school
record when they tintshed in

lziy, Tom, Koa, Furnish, and
Swanstrotu came in at 1:57.25,
more than a second under the
previous school best,

Besides the victories and the
records, most of the swimmers
established new season and/or
lifetime bests at the meet. Cain
explained that it was a good

meet, but that Lake Forest was
just “out and out faster“ than
Grinnell.

show this is not merely psycho-
logical. but actually cuts down
on resistance in the pool.

The Pioneers will be taking a
talented squad to Coe in an at
tempt to capture its 11th title in
the past 13 years. Defending in-
dividual titles will be junior Phil
Bishop, record—holder in one-me-
ter diving, who has qualified for
the national NCAA meet, and
sophomore Tom Nelson, winner
of the 400 individual medley.

Strong relay teams will also
prove to be an invaluable asset
{or Grinnell. This advantage,
coupled with the myriad of other
individual standouts, should pro-
vide the Buddha with what it
takes to win the crown.

The swimmers would love
fans, so if you can’t find any-
thing lo do at this college, go to
Cee and cheer them on. The
meet started Thursday night and
will go all day Friday and Satur-
day. Vocal fans will be greatly

What's next for
Mike Tyson?

by Bob Lifton

Everyone in the sporLs world,
as in all walks of life, strives to
be the best, Yet for some. being
the greatest can turn into an
awfully lonely ordeal.

Last Saturday evening, boxer
Mike Tyson once again proved to
any remaining skeptics that he is
the undisputed heavyweight
champion of the world. His self-
proclaimed title of the “best
fighter on the planet" no longer
seems a gross exaggeration. In
fact, it may be an understatement.

Tyson’s title fight with
English champ Frank Bruno was
being billed as the “war of the
world." Tyson’s utter domination
and subsequent (inevitable)
technical knockout in 2:55 of the
fifth round. however, was more
analogous to the Americans‘ war
in Grenada. It was over before it
started.

The outcome was naturally
no surprise. Oddsmakers had it at
9—1 in favor of Tyson. The only

question was how long Bruno
would survive. After all, Tyson
has a long history of ﬁnishing an
opponent off before he even
breaks a sweat.

Bruno's inauspicious
beginning set the tone for events
to follow. Occupants of the
$901) ringside seats visibly
winced as the challenger was
unceremoniously placed on the
canvas in the first 14 seconds.
14 seconds! That makes Leon
Spinks’ 91 seconds against the
champ seem like an eternity.
Tyson threw a few punches and
the Englishman was all but
unconscious, wondering what he
was thinking when he signed his
name on the dotted line to appear
in this contest.

Bruno eventually regrouped
and actualiy made amends by
stunning Tyson in the closing
moments of the opening round.
Tyson hurt? Isn’t that an
oxymoron? He’s supposed to be
invinsible. All it did, however,
was make Mike angrier~
