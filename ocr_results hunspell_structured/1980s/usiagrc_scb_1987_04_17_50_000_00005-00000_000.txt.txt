Tara Vaidya has been at Grinnell away
frolrl her native India tor three years. She
and many other international students
must cope \\ith "the ways" at Americans
each day. as American habits come into
conflict with their own social patterns, "In
the beginning everyone says ‘Hi,’ and asks
how you are, .You think everyone really
wants to know. Then you realize they
don't; it is Just a way here."

The tactor which appears to set interna-
tional students apart even more than dit-
tei-ences in social patterns is the entire are
ray or cultural intricacies. Carole
Saunders. from New Guinea and
Australia. said that she sometimes feels
"separated because Americans share the
same background. read the same books.
and know the same triVla "

According to Karen Leupp, Grinnell’s
German language assrstant. "Some people
“under why the international students
stay together so much. it is because you
can be yourself more nith other foreign
students, they have the same problems
and the same questions."

"Friendships are formed differently" in
America. said Atsushi Muramatsu. who iS

from Japan. “I wrote a paper on this." he

with an inner circle, or core Here. you can
easily penetrate that outside circle — and
have many somewhat supei-ticial iriend-
ships without reaching the core or a per
son in Japan we seem brusque to many
toreigners because the outside circle is
harder to get into. But once someone is let
in, they can reach into the core. it takes
that time to term a friendship, but it is a
true, strong friendship.“

Vaidya believes there is more physical

Throughout the month of April. Grinnell
is bombarded by a continuous wave oi pros
spective Students who believe that they are
receiving a legitimate picture or Grinnell
lrom tour guides. They are given “red
tops," pamphlets, course catalogues and
various other pieces at literature which in-
form them about Grinnell and try to cons
vince them to spend four years living in
Central Iowa. They also see a promotional
film which, according to dorm host Russ
Matteson, “glorifies Grinnell "

“The material is designed so that it hits
the information that prospectives want to
know about the school.” said John
Hopkins, director of Admission,

The most inﬂuential part 0| it visit to
Gl'lnnell College is the tour of the Campus,
given by a student tour guide. "You can
only read so much in a catalogue or
Viewbook," Matteson said.

According to Matteson, who has been a
tour guide tor three years now. most tour
guides genuinely like the school and want
to have a say in who is admitted Paula

and giving her "opinions about Grinnell to
them,”

“We pick variety” in selecting the to
tour guides each year. Hopkins said They
should be diverse in personality,
geographical distribution. and manner.
Student guides trom other countries are
particularly valuable

Many of the 800 to 900 Students visrtlng
each year are like freshman John Master,
who said. "This was the only place I
wanted to go," '

Others use the visit to help them make
their decision. ”Being irom California,"
said Juliette Willis, "it's very difficult to
convince yourself, or anyone else, that you
want to go to school in Iowa.“ Senior Nan-
cy Suggs said that her visit "confirmed
that this was Where I wanted to go It made
me excited,”

Although most oi the campus is discuss-
ed during a tour, the guides emphasize the
