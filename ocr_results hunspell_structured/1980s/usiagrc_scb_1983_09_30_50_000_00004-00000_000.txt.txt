A comedy of
epic proportions

The college has taken the wrong approach in dealing with the
Parslow Proposal for Curricular Change. Both students and faculty act
as if Western Civilization has reached a turning point. A quantum of
reports, survey results, new surveys, articles, and memos seek to lend
legitimacy to the claims for and against the proposal. Issues of free
will, moral rectitude, and the Good Life give the discussion epic pro-
portions. Nevertheless, what the sober observer has witnessed so far is
a spectacle, not a rational debatel Viewed properly, the Parslow Pro-
posal provides this semester’s best entertainment value. Unfortunate-
ly some people lack a proper sense of levity.

The recommendations for curricular change are not radical. As Pr0~
fessor Parslow notes in his Report to the Faculty, “we are dealing with
a matter of degree. We already have ‘Academic Requirements‘...."
The proposal merely extends requirements to include breadth and
depth throughout the curriculum rather than depth in just the major.
Only the student who refuses to construct even the most basic liberal
arts education need fear these requirements. To the conscientious stu-
dent 7 and this includes the majority a the proposed distribution of
credits presents no problems. We recommend that each student com-
pare the distribution of credits earned under the present system to the
number required in the proposal. Only a buffoon would call the re-
quirements radical.

A far more serious matter, and one that even we cannot laugh at, is
the efficacy of the Parslow Proposal in correcting fundamental difi»
ciencies in reading, writing, and critical thought. However valuable
the goals of completeness and coherence may be, their realization will
elude the student who lacks skill in reading or writing. Rather than
quibble over the concept of requirements, the students and faculty
should consider means to correct these basic problems, The goals of
the Parslow Proposal elicit little confidence in doing so.

But we are losing our sense of humor here. Think about the proposal.
By all means read it. Try to remember your own education and the fac-
tors that were beneficial and detrimental to its growth. When in need of
comic relief, attend a meeting of the faculty or Joint Board. The first
scene of our comedy was played out Monday at the former, while the
latter complimented perfectly Wednesday evening. Never to disap-
point, the members of the Joint Board are soliciting student opinion on
curricular change. It is their hope that an overwhelmingly negative
student response to the proposal will instill fear in the hearts of the
faculty. Argumentum ad Baculum, perhaps? Whatever happened to
rational discourse?

 

 

 

In defense of computer literacy

by Barry Edwards

Computers are the wave of the future
Grinnell College has very ﬁne computer
facilities which, it properly used, are suffi-
cient to place Grinnell at the forefront of
computer education. There is, however,
Considerable question as to whether Grins
nell is using its resources as heneiicially as
possible. Grinnell definitely needs to ex
pand the number and diversity of com»
puter courses which it oiiers Among the
necessary additions are a iour credit in»
troduclory course and courses leading to
an eventual Computer Science mayor.
These changes would be a major asset to
the student body and would allow Grinnell
to take a leading role in the development of
the future.

Many or those who support the college's
current policy defend their point oi View by
stating that computers are meicly tools,
not a separate discipline Admittedly,
computers are tools. however. language is
a tool, mathematics is a tool. Almost every
subJecl which Grinnell others was

developed as a tool {or achieving some end
other than the discipline itself. Computers,
as well. are extremely important for cons
tinued rapid developing technology and
lacilitating innumerable daily processes
If Grinnell does not broaden its computer
studies courses, an incredibly valuable
asset will be wasted

The uses of computers range from scien-
iiiic data processing to file storage, from
family budget management to game play-
ing in each of their many capacilies, com-
puters either shorten the amount of time
required to periarm a task, simply make
the process easier, or any his vast number
of useiul iunclions They can solve coins
plex math in very lime time. or they can
simply do some of thetedlous, repitilious
work which we all dread In essence, their
many uses can save people much time and
eliort

"If he's interested in computers, he
should go to another school." is an attitude
I have also heard. This argument, oi
