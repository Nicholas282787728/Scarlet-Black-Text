 

This thing with girls, it’s painful
Kevin McKeougb

This evening, The Royal winnipeg Ballet
(anyone who doesn't know who they are by
now is advised to attend the reception for
the troupe scheduled to take place in
Cooper School) will inaugurate this year’s

series of performing arts events in Roberts

Theater. This is not their story.

This is the story of the place in which
they will perform. Robem Theater serves
as not only the primary facility for fine
arts performances of all kinds, but as the
college's main rehearsal space, the
theater department shoproom, the
Stagecraft class's lab and, once every
year, the seminar room for a group of cone
ventioneering insurance salesmen which
inexplicably descend upon Grinnell each
fall, These combined functions make the
facility of some modest importance to the
vitality of performing arts programs at
Grinnell.

As such, Robers ls a satisfactory facili»
ty. “Satisfactory" is a first cousin to “in-
teresting,” as is “unique,” the word which
Associate Professor of Theater and
Theater Department Technical Director
Jan Czechowski uses to describe Roberts.
Yes, the theater’s curved stage, utter lack
of oft stage and aboverstage space,
cramped back stage shop area and swim-
ming pool acoustics do make it both “in-

teresting” and “unique," They also often
make it a performance space in which ar-
tists function with difficulty, To accom-
modate the Royal Winnipeg Ballet
(remember them?), for example, a rather
large plywood platform was laid atop the
stage floor. Otherwise, local doctors might
make a fortune curing the shin splints and
other injuries that result when dancers br»
ing their feet down on floors as non
resilient as the concrete-based one in
Roberts,

That the dance troupe's needs could be
accommodated is a testament to the flexi-
ble character of the building. Such adapr
tability has made it possible for many on,
ferent groups to use the facility. despite
some of the limitations inherent in its
design. Rather than temporarily adjusting
the space every time a new group of per»
formers arrives, the theater could be
modified permanently and brought to what
Czechowski calls “optimum usefulness."
in the eyes of many, this usefulness could
he best achieved if the college simply did
to Roberts what lsrael did to Iraq's reacV
tor, and then build a brand new
auditorium, preferably one large enough
to accommodate Grinnell's booming
number of dance enthusiasts Such action
is not likely to occur

Czechowski’s proposals are more sensir
ble. i-lis suggestions include making
acoustic improvements to the facility,
erecting a new shop facility adjacent to the
theater. adjusting the shape of the stage
itself and moving the stage’s rear wall
backward by about one dozen feet, which
would allow for increased performance
space and use potential, At the very least,
new curtains and seats and an new stage
floor must be provrded, The lack of shop
space in the building necessitates that con
struction take place on stage, which has
both damaged the floor and coated the
seats and curtains with 20 years worui of
sawdust,

The administration, bless their
cholesterol-laden hearts, have already
begun reviewing the situation, The first
major factor in determining the building's
ultimate fate will be the report of a cams
pus planner, who will be examining the en
tire layout of the college during the ensu»
ing months. In May, the planner will
recommend improvements to the Board of

, Trustees, who will then assess priorities

and allocate funds [or improvements, The
trustees would do well to keep Roberts
Theater's simultaneous existence as both

a fine arts facility benefiting the entire ~

campus community and as an academic
laboratory for theater students in mind.

 

The Apology '

Part 427

One ﬁling I’ve always loved about vaca-
tion is having all my parents' friends ask
me what f‘m going to do when I graduate,
“I don’t know,“ I inevitably answer in so
many words, Some people, though, know
better than to ask ﬂ'lis most tactless of
tactless questions, and some learn fast and
quickly to change the subject. “What are
you majoring in?" these enlightened ones
(or embarrassed as the case may be) ask.
That’s not such a bad question 7 the
answer‘s easy: “I’m taking a double ma
jor in philosophy and general science.“

Most people never hear uie general
. science part. The word “philosophy," I’ve
found, has a way of dropping like a lead
balloon. it evokes two types of responses:
occasionally someone says something like,
“I’ve always liked philosophy,” or “My
wife majored in philosophy" or “My son is
taking philosophy.” But the typical
response, (discounting the ineVitable wise
guy who asks, “Well, what‘s your
philosophy?”), is a reversion to the con-
versation’s tactless beginnings: “What
are you going to do with philosophyi" or
its somewhat improved analog, “Why did
you choose that?" (I’ve often wanted to
say I was majoring in accounting and com-
puter science and compare the responses.)
Most people, it seems, just don't see much
in philosophy. Either that or it intimidates
the hell out of them, (More than likely, the
Ruth lies somewhere between the two.)

it’s true, though; philosophy has a way
of coming off (as I’ll never forget telling
Dan Magurshak on the first day oi my in-
tro class) as nothing but an elaborate exer-
cise in mental masturbation. It is argued,
philosophically as well as commonsen-
sically, that philosophy creates the pro—
blems which are its subject matter. To put
it paradoxically, it it weren't for
philosophers, there wouldn't be anything
to philosophize about, (which came iirst 7
the chicken or the egg?)

Philosophers deal With concepts
abstracted from things (die latter being
supposedly “real" and the former “con-
structs"). Philosophers like to talk about
“form" and “essence” and “meanings”

and ”logical relationships” and
”necessary truths.” (Have you ever seen a
“meaning”?) These aren't the sort of
things you eat for dinner (which may be
why so many philosophers starve). Norv
mal people on the other hand, talk about
uieir grades, what they ate for dinner, nice
sunsets and so on (not to neglect that
universal favorite 7 other people).

But (I try breauilessly to explain to the
senior partner of Frump, shodgrass and
Moneyhags), there is more to philosophy
than its subject matter. Philosophy is the
art of critical thinking. The business of the
philosopher is to propose new ways of
understanding old things 7 and then to
figure out why they still don't work (as
they seemingly never do), As such,
philosophy lies at the root of all academic
disciplines. Sclentific method is a product
oi philosophy, historiography could be
called ”philosophy oi history,” art is an
exercise in the philosophical realm of
aesthetics, political theory rests on
philosophical emics. Every field has its
underlying assumptions, and these are the
business of philosophy.

Any and every discipline is a particular
way of approaching particular things, and
chances are it was invented by a
phil isopher, There was no study of physics
unll Newton’s Philosophicus Naturales,
and there was no study of literature until
Aristotle’s Poetics (well. sort of). Thus, I
find philosophy the ideal focus for a solid
liberal arts education. (Something I hap-
pen to believe in,)

Even outside academia’s ivory tower,
philosophy remains pertinent. The ability
to think critically, logically and
systematically is an asset everywhere and
anywhere in the world. Doctors are ex-
pected to know and interrelate volumes of
physiological iniormation — and then to

apply it to real problems, Lawyers learn ~

volumes of law, pick it apart, put it back
together again and develop arguments
from it. Business executives spend their
lives being told “we have a problem" and
being expected to iigure out what the pro»
blem is and what to do about it. (That’s the
whole world 7 doctors, lawyers and
MBAS, isn't it? . . . at least mat’s all that
matters _ , _surburban cocktail parties.)

Computer programmers are
systematizers and problem solvers,
teachers are (hopefully) clear, organized
thinkers , , . artists and writers are . . . um.
well . i you know. , .

But the greatest benefits oi philosophy
are its most private ones. The word
“philosophy" comes from the Greek philos
(love) and Sophia (wisdom). The
philosopher is the lover of wisdom, And the
study of philosophy, more than anything
else. brings wisdom (just ask a
philosopher). Throughout history,
philosophers have attempted to
systematize the world of thought, observa»
tion and analysis (and failed miserably). ’
Among them there have been some very
insightful men with some very ingenious
ideas. And as a breed, philosophers aren‘t
very repetitive people (at least not on the
surface).

The philosopher strives for a systematic,

’ holistic View oi the world of things and

ideas. He finds and simplifies relation»
ships between seemingly unrelated
phenomena. So when one takes some time
to look at all these great men's ideas about
things, one can’t help but assimilate some
of them and develop, in general, a much
deeper way oi looking and thinking about
what you once thought were things. Thus,
philosophy brings, along with knowledge,
deeper and more profound understanding.
Is this not wisdom?

Maybe this is why philosophy draws
such pallid expressions at cocktail parties,
One can’t possibly understand its wisdom
without studying it (no chickens or eggs
here), Perhaps the perception of
something very deep and very profound
going on, combined with being decidedly
left out, makes people feel uncomfortable,
Why shouldn't it?

There are two important lessons to be
learned from this essay First, never talk
philosophy around people who aren’t
philosophically inclined. They don't like it
and rightfully so, Second, if you're a
philosophy major, attend cocktail parties
armed with xeroxed copies oi this essay to
hand out to every dumbfounded dumb‘
%*13 who asks, “why than", trying to
Sound like they know enough about it to'
scorn it.

Student
Burnout

Camping
out

Steve
Burnett

So the library isn’t going to be giving out
carrels. They can be obtained only on a
firstcome, firstrserve basis. i remember
what happened last year. As the year wore
on study carrels started becoming small
dorm rooms. 1 don't mean the assigned
carrels on the mezzanine at Burling but
the unassigned ones downstairs at Burling
and at the Science Library,

Especially Ute Science Library. People
were camping out there. You would expect
to see books at a carrel or two, but entire
collections were being arranged, people
had toothbrushes, personalized mugs, hot»
tles of prescription (7) drugs, even pic-
tures of girlfriends on the Carrels. Those
folks aimed m stay.

Well, however, it seems the people who
ran the libraries sort oi started to crack
down. Everyday, they would send a stu-
dent over to the Science Library to take
everything that was on a carrel which had
no occupant and put it on the student
shelves. (it figures that the people who
made the decision to have this done would
send a student.)

This caused some ire, but tor the most
part the students simply accepted the rule
and settled down to figuring out ways to
circumvent it. One student placed his
books on a sheli close to the carrels, but
alas, it was a bookshelf, not a student
shelf. When confronted with the reality

, that they must go, he protested, “What's

the difference between this shelf and the
student shelves over there?" “Above 20
feet,” he was informed,

Before the rule, i suppose there was a
reason to camp out, One needed to “shake
a claim” to insure a spot later. Soon, peo»
pic were staking claims earlier and mrlier
until eventually, “early" became “perma-
nent," After the rule, people were still
leaving books on carrels, but they were
also leaving little notes that said things
like, “If you want to use my carrel and
there are no others available, just move
my books." I wonder if that was the “n,
written code before enforced politeness, or
if by leaving their lives on a carrel, they
were really saying, ”Stay away! This is
my carrelt"

Well, if something like that is not to hap-
pen again, some solution has to be found.
Guess who’s got the solution. That’s right,
I do. And here it is.

The basement at Burling is not yet com-
pleted. With just a few changes, it could be
turned into a dorm, That’s right, a dorm,
That way students really could live at die
library.

My suggestion has other advantages as
well. For instance, this will help obviate
any future problems with overcrowding in
the dorms. Also, we will always know
which hall is going to be Quiet Hall, We will
need to name the dorms and that will bring
in a few million dollars from someone who
wants to buy his or her way into Grinnell
history. . ~
