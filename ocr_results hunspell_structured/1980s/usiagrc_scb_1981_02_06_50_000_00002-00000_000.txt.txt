What happened last Sunday in South Lounge couldn’t be called a
resurrection of student radicalism. But it could be viewed as an
ongoing concern, even in these days of “conservatism" and
“apathy." So what happened? Well, a small group of Grinnellians
organized under the Audubon banner held a letter-writing campaign
for the Clean Air Act As a result, in two hours they collected over 100
letter and cards addressed to various members of the us Congress.

Clean air. A very simple and concrete concept, especially here in
Iowa where the only pollution comes from a variety of agricultural
odors. Few of us think about the air we breathe, at least while we’re
in Iowa. Some of us seldom think about our air because we’ve never
lived in or visited an area where the silent menace, smog, burns
throats, stings eyes and affects us in other, more subtle ways.

But even in Iowa we really aren’t free of polluted airt Scientists
periodically release reports which show how the particulates of the
cities linger in the atmosphere over the cornfields, Every year the
air gets dirtier as more vehicles take to the highways and coal burn-
ing becomes our “alternate" energy source. No one know how much
is too much, where the point of no return sets in,

So far we’ve managed to avoid a major environmental crisis
through the Clean Air Act, first implemented in 1975, This act pro-
tects us by requiring certain devices on industrial and private ex-
haust systems which capture some of the wastes before they reach
the atmosphere

However, this act also faces tough opposition from profit-minded
corporate interests. During the past six years, instead of digging in
and improving the technology of pollution devices, these companies
have fought the restrictions Instead of making inexpensive, easy to

install device mechanisms, they continually try to find loopholes in
the law or ask for extentions in compliance. But are we willing to

allow industry to do a cost-benefit analysis for us or will we do one
for ourselves?

Presently the issue lies in committee and is scheduled to reach the
floor sometime this year. In the meantime Audubon and other
environmentally-oriented groups are gearing up for the battle;
they’ve started to put Congress on notice through mailing efforts
similar to the one last Sunday, However, people need not restrict
themselves to organized campaigns The more mail our represen~
tatives receive with the simple words “I support the Clean Air Act,”
the more positively they will think when it comes time to vote yes for
renewal. Remember, it‘s your air, too.

Scarlet and Block,
