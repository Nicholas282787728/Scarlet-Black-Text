Campus opinion

compiled by Barbara Brown
Question; Do you iavor anv Dara
ticular Presidential candidatcist
at diis time? it so, whom do you
favor and why?

Schwarl: I favor Jack
Kemp, Republican Representative
irom New York, mainly because
he seems to have a vision that

‘agrees with my views oi how

government should operate. and I
believe he is capable of leading this
society and Congress in ac-
complishing these goals by becom-
ing President.

Susan Stailnrd: Simon and

, Jackson are my iavorites at the

moment, but I'm still undecided. I
liked a lot of what Jackson had to

1 say, but 1 wish he had talked about
, now he wanted to accomplish his
; goals. Simon seems to have a lot oi

experience and some really good
ideas, but he was sort oi hedging
some oi the questions.

Richard Ross: I’m undecided, but

i [tend to lean toward Paul Simon. I

think he's the least personally am
bitious oi all the candidates. and
he’s a very intelligent person

Sara Deichman: I'm undecided,
Dukakis seems to be too imposing,
Simon seems really sweet and
honest, but he beat around the bush
on a couple oi questions and that
annoyed me

ti»

hill Chaney: Paul Simon olall the
Democrats right now, 1m most
impressed with his experience, his
accomplishments, and his ex
perience in Washington. His
policies are sensible and 1 trust
him.

Todd Fax: Jack Kemp. largely
because oi his anti-Communism
and his unabashed advocacy oi
iree enterprise. He‘s the one can
didate who isn't ashamed to note
that capitalism has been many
times more successiul than any oi
the socialist panaceas oi the Left.

Ann Maker: [don’t iaVDr anyone at
the moment, I'm a Republican and
1 don’t like any oi the Republican
candidates. so rm shopping
around in the Democratic Party.
