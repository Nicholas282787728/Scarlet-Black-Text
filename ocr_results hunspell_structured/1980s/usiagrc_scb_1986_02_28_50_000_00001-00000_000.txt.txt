Tuition Increases:
Administration
explains wily

by .lohn Harrison

The comprehensive fee for Grinnell Col-
lege for the academic year 1936-87 will be
311.930: this is an increase of over 8% from
last year‘s iee oi $10,980.

Last year the college raised its tuition by
7% and in the last four years. the tuition
has increased by 33%. .

These statistics all but speak for
themselves: tuition at Grinnell College has
been going up quickly. Yet exactly why
Grinnell’s tuition goes up is rarely
understood by the student body.

President George Drake admitted that
although tuition's have greatly increased,
Grinnell students still pay less than the
students at other colleges mentioned in the
much quoted U45, News and World Report
poll oi the top ten liberal arts colleges.

in justiiying a 8% tuition increase,
Drake pointed to the college’s concerted
effort to raise faculty salaries,

Drake said that during the 1970’s and
50's, colleges and universities were not

» keeping salaries at pace with cost at living
increase and the college is now attempting
to make up the difference of the past.

Drake also stated the need for the col-
lege to remain competitive with other top
liberal art colleges in terms of faculty
salaries.

The college has planned to raise faculty
salaries 25% to 30% over the next four
years.

Waldo Walker, Vice President ol’ the Cole

' lege stated that other causes for Grinnell‘s
skyrocketing tuition is due to educational
inilaiion. Walker pointed out that although
the nation's inflation rate is at 3%, the in-
flaiion rate on college and universities is
far above the national rate.

Walker points to the high cost of the cole
lege’s computer expansion program over
the last three years as a partial justifica-
tion for the raise in tuition.

Walker also stressed the enormous costs
of maintaining the library’s collection
where book Costs can inflate by as much as
16718% in a single year.

Furthermore, Walker pointed to the ins
crease in utility costs. Walker said, “We
have increased our utility usage by 7%
over the last year.”

President Drake made the point that
although college tuition may appear to he
out of line, “Grinnell College’s tuition has
always been about that of a mediumrsized
car.”

urane stresses that Grinnell runs an ex-
pensive program and that student‘s tuition
payments only go to support a little over
40% or the colleges costs. But, questions do
arise on the eiiect oi Grinnell‘s rising tui-
tion on the makeup oi the student body,

Drake does admit that “people will
judge you on your price."

But he emphasizes that Grinnell's
generous financial aid has and will prevent
it] trom becoming a school ior the wealthy
e ile.

And irom looking at the median income,
it appears Grinnell has up until now
preserved its predominantly middle class
student body.

John Hopkins. Director oi Admissions
and Financial Aid said. “the median in
come oi the Grinnell parent is the same
now as it was in the past,” ~ ,

Currently the median income oi those
iamilies which file Financial Aid Forms, is
approximately 345.000,

Ed Barboni, Director oi Planning and
Evaluation said directly, “tuition raises at
Grinnell have no substantial eiiect on the
applicant pool,"

Yet, when posed with a hypothetical
situation oi what would happen to the ap-
plicant pool ii the college were to lower its
tuition, Hopkins responded by saying, “A
lower tuition would cause the coiiegc to not
get the wise purchaser."

The question of colleges becoming in-
situtions oi the wealthy elite are impor-
tant.

Although Grinnell may be tree irom hav»
ing to alter its student body due to its en-
dowment, many other colleges are not so
fortunate.

Drake and Walter both tear that with
raising tuition and the potential eitect oi
the Gramm-Rudman budget cuts.
American liberal arts colleges could very
well become schools of wealthy students.

Within the Associated Colleges of the
Midwest (ACM), Grinnell is only exceeded
by Lake Forest College in its tuition raise
ior 1936-87. Carleton leads the ACM col»
leges with a comprehensive fee for next
year oi $12,770. .

When trustee Vernon Faulconer was
asked about the 11% tuition raise he said, “I
think we raised tuition because we knew
we could get away with it... there is no
doubt, we don‘t need the money.”

As to the iuture, Drake said, “I doubt ii
tuition Would ever remain constant.”

Science Building
to Sprout

by Lois Harrison
Within the next two years, the flow of

' students traipsing in and out at psychology

classes in Goodnow Hall Will be but a
memory. As part oi the continuing renovar
tion efforts on the Grinnell campus. the
psychology department along with the
math department. will be moving into a
newly created $3 million dollar 7 wing of
the existing science building,

The area ‘now set. aside as the back parks
iilg lot of the Science building will be
replaced by the two story addition which is
expected to be completed by the fall oi
1987. The decision to move the psychology
department out oi Goodnow and into a new
location. was one. according to Psychology
Department head Tom Brozowksi, “long
in coming". Brozowski stated that plans
dating back to Sept. 19. 1977, had been sub»
milled by the department to find an alter-
native location for the psychology depart-
ment. .

Goodnow Hall. according to Brozowskl.
has been ”used and abused by a number oi
departments” since its initial use as the
campus library in the late 1800‘s. Citing
such problems as insuiiicient space, struc-

lural problems, and an ongoing battle with
mice and other rodents, Brozowksi stated
that the move out oi" the building was
“something that had to be done this year.”

A report by the state Fire Marshal this
year had also revealed that GOOdnow was
in violation of several lire codes, including
a lack of sufficient fire escapes and an ap
propriate alarm system. Prolessor
Charles Duke, who headed the faculty
Committee in charge of finding a new loca-
tion for the math and psychology depart
ments reported that a number of possible
locations had been Considered for the new
building. A possible site between AR}! and
the entrance of the Science building was
rejected by the committee as being
“aesthetically unpleasant" as the building
would effectively block the line of vision
between the north and south ends of Cams
pus, A second location, east oiDarby gym-
nasium was also rejected on the grounds
that it would be relatively “isolated from
the rest of the classroom buildings” accor-
ding to Duke.

The new location, connected to the east
end of the science building, was chosen for
a variety of reasons. One of'the most ob-

A'Minor issue

by Jill Ellis

The issue of whether or not Grinnell Col-
lege should offer a minor has once again
been brought to the students’ attention.

The implementation oi a minor presents
both problems and benefits, and it is
crucial for the students to understand all
aspects oi the proposal belcre they iorm
their educated opinions on the matter,

The minor proposal has a long history
already, as SGA vice president Pam Welch
explained to the 8&8. The proposal which
Welch will be submitting to the Cur-
riculum Committee next week is radier
complicated due to problems which
previous minor proposals have had to
overcome. These problems, according to
Welch, extend from the fact that, essen-
tially. “the college isn't big enough to hanr

die a minor.” In addition, Welch said, .

“everyting-[about the institution of a
minor] is political and bureaucratic.”

A complete understanding oi the current
proposal requires a knowledge or the
history oi previous proposals, in the spring
semester of 1985, Mary Kosmidls (then
SGA vice president) submitted the “first
generation” minor proposal to the Cur-
riculum Council (a student organization
with jurisdiction in academic areas, con-
sisting or the student head oi each depart
ment's are) and to the Curriculum Com»
mittee (a standing committee consisting of
the Dean oi Faculty, Chairman oi Faculty,
iacultymembers irom each division, and
[our selected students).

Although students iavored Kosmidis’
proposal, “it didn’t go over well." accor-
ding to Welch, because “the iaculty didn’t
want to deal \vilh it ..

Welch explained that the taciilty saw
three basic problems with the minor

First, establishing a uniform set of
guidelines ior a minor would be pro-
blematic for threeelourths of the depart-
ments, Second, some iaculty members relt
thai a mirror would he merely a “watered
down and ambiguous” version oi a major,
and would not be Substantive enough to
warrant mention on a degree.

The third problem faculty saw with the
minor was that students wanted the minor
option ior the wrong reasons; that is,
students wanted minors solely [or the 0f-
iicial recognition on their diplomas, and
not because they were truly interested in
the subject material, This complaint
seems to be overwhelmingly substan-
tiated; most students, when asked why
they want a minor degreeu give as their
primary reason the desire to have Official
recognition on their diploma of work they
have done outside of their major.

However, faculty members did express
interest in the minor as an alternative to
the double major, which faculty Viewed as
counteracting the purpose of a liberal arts
education. students who double major are
trapped in a tightly structured curriculum.
and do not have the opportunity tor a
broadlybased, ideal “liberal-arts" educa-
lion.

Similarly, the inter-disciplinary concen-
trations currently oiiered by the college
require too many credits (anywhere irom
32 to 35F, and—thus compete with the stile
dent’s major. lWelch noted that a restrucA
tured interdisciplinary concentration con-
sisting or only 22-26 credits, is being con-
sidered ior next year)

The variety oi inter-disciplinary Concen-
trations available is quite limited (there
are only a listed in the catalog. although 4
new concentrations are being planned ior
