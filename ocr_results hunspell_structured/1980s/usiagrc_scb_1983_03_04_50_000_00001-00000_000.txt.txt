Relays
commlttee

planning a
big show

by Eric Green

On the weekend of April 29-31, the Grin-
nell Relays will enter its second decade of
decadence with a large number of all-
campus events including the Saturday
afternoon games so loved by thirsty, aspir-
ing athletes.

Despite rumors to the contrary, funding
from SGA should not be any problem, ac7
cording to Relays Committe member
Mark Conterato. After some initial delay
in formulating the budget, Conterato and
his co-chairs Jim Greenberg, Brad
Bobertz and Bill McCullough have
prepared their proposal and should pre»
sent it next week.

The events planned include at least one
band. the Titular Head talent Show, a mid-
night movie, a Bloody Mary Bagel
Breakfast and a parade.

The committee feels that Titular Head
should be altered in order to avert a repeat
of last year's beer bath Both Greenberg
and Conterato noted that many people at-
tended last year’s contest in Darby for the
express purpose of throwing suds and the
like at the'performels.

The audience needs to he in a better
frame of mind, according to Conterato. He
said this may require tighter controls on
the audience. A change of venue, perhaps
to Gardner Lounge, is being considered as
a partial remedy.

The acts will again be screened
beforehand. Greenberg feels the deb were
not the main problem, saying, “They
showed real talent — in an offbeat sense."
Conterato made it clear that the
seriousness will not be taken too far when
he said, “Personally, i think ‘rowdy' is still
the theme for Relays.”

The committee is hoping to get Animal
House for the midnight movie on Friday. A
Thursday night film is also under con-
sideration. There will be a Friday night
dance, yet at this point the band is
unknown. '

Dave McConnell, food service director,
has shown reluctance to provide a picnic
this year. He claims that too much money
is lost irom people not on board eating at
the evening picnic. The Relays Committe
is negotiating with him in hopes of making
a deal of some sort. if plans with McCon~
nell [all through, the Relays Committee is
considering alternative picnic ideas.

Before Relays weekend, T-shirts and
painter's caps, a new item, will be sold.
Conterato also said that last year’s pres
weekend history of the Relays may also be
repeated this year.

Conterato expressed slight concern
about the future of the Relays should Iowa
adopt legislation raising the drinking age
to 21. He pointed out that the Relays began
quite informally with students purchasing
a mere three kegs (the number will be
more than 10 times that this year) and runs
ning the races on central campus.

He said that if school officials no longer
sanction Relays, it could return to its past
and again be run less formally. He added,
“I don't think it can be stopped if the
students want to do it.”

Judging from last year's success, it
seems the Relays will remain a sacred ac»
tivity at Grinnell. Although at this moment
the Tashirts must be designed, the movie
and band committed and the bagels pur~
chased, Conterato stated' emphatically

' “The beer is on order." ‘

Recent events allegedly have no

bearing on new policy

New damage rule makes
floors accountable

by Laura Mcnerrniih

Last fall the Committee on Student Life
reviewed and changed the policy on
damage to common areas in the residence
halls. According to Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Tederman, chairman of the Commit
tee, the policy was due for review. The
policy was not changed because of an in-
crease in vandalism or because of any
specific act.

The new policy requires individuals to
pay for damages rather than charging
fines to hall funds. Damage done to “come
mon areas" in the dorm will be paid for by
all dorm members out of their continuing
enrollment funds. The official policy
reads: “A hall common area is an area
generally accessed in common by the
members of the entire hall. These include
study lounges, kitchens, stairwells, etc."

Damage done to a floor common area,
such as the hallway or the bathroom, is
paid for by floor members only, again out
of their continuing enrollment funds. Cam-
pus common areas such as Cowles first,
Main first, Gardner lounge and laundry
areas are not conSldered to be dorm coins
mon areas because they are accessible to
all students,

According to Tederman, the old policy
was changed because it was ineffective
and hall funds were being depleted. Some
halls were running out of money as early
as the first few weeks of school.

”Damages tended to be clumped," said
Tederlﬁﬁﬁj that an entire hall was cons
sistently being held responsible for the ac-
tions of only a few hall members. The van-
dalism continues because “Hall funds are
too distant from the individual," Tederr
man maintains.

Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Bob
Towner-Larson is responsible for imr
plementing the new policy. He said the
change is “consistent with the ida of self
governance" among the students, Teder-
man agreed, saying that along with the
benefits of being self-governing; students

should also take the responsibility that ‘

 

goes with it.

Tederman believes some students are
against the new policy because they feel
they will be forced into “flnking" on their
hallmates or into paying for damage
themselves. He compared the dorm_ situa-
tion to a shared apartment. whe‘n' damage
is done in an apartment, all must pay; it
only one person did the damage, his/her
roommates would ask him/her to pay.

”In most instances people know” who
has done the damage, said Tederman.

Another student complaint concerns ace
cidental damages. TownerrLarson stated,
“Students are still accountable [in cases of
accidental damage]. but we are lenient in
assessing damage,"

Tederman made the following analogy:
“What if you walked into a store and
knocked over a $250 piece of crystal?" He
stressed that there was definitely “room
for compromise." rines have been drop-
ped completely in some circumstances.

There is an appeals process “built into
the system,” noted Tederman, There was
a great deal of flexibility in the old policy,
and according to Tederman there is no
reason why that would change under the
new system.

Residence halls were charged $943.79 for
damages to the dorms last fall, Charges
were slightly less than 31000 ior the
academic year 1981-82. These damage
figures do not include damage done to
nonresidence buildings. According to
Tederman, the school does not have a very
good system for regularly obtaining infor
mation on damages to the campus.

Tederman said that compared to other
schools of its type, Grinnell has a very low
rate of vandalism. He quickly added that
any vandalism is in no way justifiable, but
“The student body ought to be commend-
ed" for the low rate of damage. Tederman
contends that he has heard of as much
damage done in one weekend at another
school as n an entire academic year at
Grinnell.‘- - , ,

Many issues
raised at JB

by Jane Kaufman

Reports of the past week's activities and
business occupied Wednesday nights SGA
Joint Board meeting.

Vice President Mark Bradshaw, acting
in place of President John Moffet, opened
the meeting with his own reports and with
reports of Moflet’s meetings, with the ad»
ministration. He announced that the ad-
ministration “wlll be putting out a written
statement," concerning the Federal Selec-
tive Service Law.

Concerning provision of the shuttle ser-
vice next year, Bradshaw informed JB,
“The administration, next fall, will be
handling the shuttles through we travel
service in town," He explained the change
by saying, ”It’s kind of a strain on the stu-
dent coordinator's office. Student Affairs
fields a lot of complaints, and they would
rather be directly responsible than
vicariously responsible.”

As ex officio member of the Committee
on Student Life, Bradshaw disclosed that a
“study space questionnaire went out" to
determine the use of extra Carrels added
during the Burling Library renovation. A
study is also in effect to determine the
possibility of having a nurse in the Health
Center on Sundays.

FinallyI Bradshaw announced that Stu-
dent Affairs will pay for 3&G's services at
the James Hall Bacchanal and Loose Hail
Ball.

Allison Paich, student coordinator,
notified JB that ‘ im Tederamn, dean of
student affairs, instituted a policy that
we're not supposed to have mid-week
dances. ” The policy will be brought to CSL
next week.

Jeff Schmidt, Main Hall president, ask-
ed if there was anything that Could be done
about me noise level in Darby during
tomorrow‘s Loose Hall Ball. Peder
Fretheim, Loose Hall president, explain
ed, ”Because of the acoustics we're going
to put parachutes all along the ceiling of
Darby."

ln reply to the suggestion of contracting
with bands about noise regulation, Paich
explained that, “We don’t sign contracts“
because of the specificity involved.
