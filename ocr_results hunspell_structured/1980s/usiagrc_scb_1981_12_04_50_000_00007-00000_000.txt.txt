New look hoopsters are on the rise
But edged by Carleton, 49-48

by Rick Richardson

They're the ”New Breed" of Grinnell
Pioneers, the most impressive frosh con-
tingent in recent years. They're Coach
John Harvey's “elastic band" of
newcomers with big hopes and plenty oi
enthusiasm. They're Tim Dick, Mark
Kelley, John Kispert, Jim Niemeyer and
John Scholz. The Peterson Era is over.
RIP.

Last year, the Pioneers raised their vic-
tory total from Zilch to three in Harvey‘s
first season. This year, despite losses such
as Pat Walsh, the second-leading scorer in
Grinnell College history, Harvey is op-
timistic that the team will continue to im-
prove, The strength Will be provided by co~
captains Dave Nash and Ralph Staples,
returning lettermen Jeff Hahn, Mike

. Neeley and Pete Schumacher, newcomer
Gene Reid and the freshmen.
Uniortunately, a strong secondhali

Dave Cooke has been selected as the
most valuable member of the 1981 men’s
cross country team at Grinnell College. A
senior who missed most of the 1980 cam~
paign because oi an injury, Cooke came
back Strong this fall and held down the
number one spot in the lineup

The first Pioneer across the finish line in
every 1981 race he ran, Cooke received a
trophy which is annually donated by John
Walden '58. Cooke was individual winner
at the Simpson Invitational and took third
at the Luther Invitational, fourth at the
Midwest Conference Meet and fifth at the
Carleton Invitational. He finished sixth at
the NCAA Division 111 Regional Meet and
was 54th at the NCAA Division lll National
Championship Meet.

A new award, the Dick Gilbert Leader-
ship Award, went to Charla Briggs. The
award honors Gilbert, the most valuable
player of the loan Grinnell cross country
team, who died this fall following an acci-
dent.

John Kissane earned the most improved
citation and Cheyne Bamiord was picked
as the most valuable freshman

comeback by the Pioneers was not enough

, to overcome Carleton in last Tuesday’s

home opener, as Grinnell iell short by a
score oi 4943. Nash and Niemeyer com bin-
ed ior all of Grinnell's scoring in the iirst
half, when the Carls amassed a 34-15 lead

However, the second hall belonged to the
Pioneers, whose stingy delense and pa-

tient offense produced the comeback, ,

Nash and Niemeyer again led the charge
with Dick providing many key buckets.
When Nash made both ends oi a oneand-
one with 1:47 remaining to put the
pioneers within one point, the already wild
crowd went insane. The ball then changed
possessions twice before Dick was fouled
with :23 leit in the game. Dick canned both
shots to give Grinnell its only lead oi the
game, «la-47.

But Carleton’s Ken Harvey scored easily

on a drive to the hoop only seconds later
and, with :07 remaining, Grinnell took the
ball out of bounds. A last ditch effort failed
and the Pioneers had to settle for an “AM
shucks."

Nash and Niemeyer paced the Pioneers
with 19 points apiece, while Dick con»
tributed eight,

Grinnell is now so alter dropping a pair
oi games in South Dakota last weekend.
The Pioneers opened the season with a
69-58 loss to Yankton College, Nash led the
attack with 21 points, iollowed by Dick
with 14 and Niemeyer with 12 “We played
a good game and did a line Job oi slowing
down Yanktnn‘s fast-break offense."
Harvey said, indeed, the Pioneer strategy
is designed to “frustrate the run-andrgun
offenses,”
