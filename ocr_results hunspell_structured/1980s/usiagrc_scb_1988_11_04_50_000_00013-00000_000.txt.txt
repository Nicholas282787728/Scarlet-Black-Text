Hunter S. Thompson‘s Generation of
Swine: a bit stale, but still great fun

by Matthew Macho

It is past midnight as I
walk onto the run-down porch.
crowded with people, A crowd
surrounds a keg of beer, queing
up as though for some holy Eu»
charist or Communion. The
Reggae throb of Bob Marley
bumps through the crowd with a
physical presence. like tlte thick
reefer smoke that billows forth as
I open the front door. A dozen
young students, the cream of
American academia, stand around
in a circle frying brain cells with
the devil weed. Marijuana.
"Gotta light?" one pothead in a
grimy overcoat asks. I fumble
for my lighter, get another joint
lit and take tlte ceremonial ﬁrst
drag, passing it on. I can see my
Supreme Court nomination spi-
raling down to hell, down past
Reaganomics. Geraldo Rivera and
even Ollie North. who lies for-
gotten. screaming in some blaz-
ing wasteland in Tampa But I
take another hit and I don‘t give a
damn anymore -- hell, the court‘s
"hetero: only" anyway. They
oughtta post a sign.

Well. one can only take so
much pot. even if it is free. so
after reaching a few with my
Swiss army knife tweezers I
headed back home, fumbling for
some amusement [0 kECp me OC‘
cuppied as my head spins and
spins and spins. Stumbling into
my darkened room, I flick on the
light switch and fall into bed,
reaching for a book, any book. I
end up with Hunter S. Thomp-
son's Generation ofSwirie, Good
choice. Flip through this sucker
-- let’s ﬁnd some stuff I haven't
read yet. One problem with
books that are more or less col-
lections of old essays and articles
-- I like to flip around, but then
get stuck when I’ve read most of
the stuff, but can't find that other
twenty or thirty percent. I kinda
liked Thompson's real Bogksa
bit better. You can read through
them and they really M »- it's

The one he wrote about hanging
out with the Hell's Angel's for a
year or so -- that was some wild

shit. Probably tlte best thing
he's ever written. or will ever
write.

Some of this stuff is a bit
dated -- observations. rants, dia-
tribes. etc. from the past three
years or so. In some cases it's
still fresh. as when he talks about
blowing up a car laden with ex-
plosives. or almost getting his
throat slit by two burly pirates
off the coast of Florida Some of
his political stuff is good too,
but who's not sick of hearing
about Iranscam. even if in
Hunter's vicious. ripping style?
His adventures in Las Vegas
casinos (including run-ins with
stungun-wielding mafia thugs)
are great fun to read. but in spite
of the editor's sycophancy to the
contrary. Hunter's own oddsmak-
ing on political races are nothing
I'd lay money on. He predicted
Reagan would be thrown out of
ofﬁce at least three times (the old
guy's still in there, Hunter) and
his odds against George Bush
getting the nomination were 100-
l (everyone else seemed to know
the big shrub would get it easily.
Hunter). I guess this relates to
Hunter‘s frequent preachiness --
he'd be a lot more fun if he'd stop
playing the part of a knee-jerking
loose cannon advocate for the
Democratic Party and get on to
what he does best .1 tell bizarre
stories and rank on political
ineptitude.

All in all. this stuff doesn‘t
quite measure up to Hunter's best
stuff-some of it smells a bit
stale. and some reeks of too
much preaching (from Hunter S.
Thompson?!) But it's still great
fun -- nobody rants better than
good old HST. This one runs
about twenty bucks at bookstores
around the country ~- and
strangely enough. costs about the
same at the "non proﬁt" book—
store of this top-ten college.
Hell, steal yourself a copy if you
don‘t want to give that milk-
shake-laden robber baron a cut of

your hardeamed cash. It's what
Hunter'd do. But has he ever
bogarted joints with a pair of
Swiss army knife tweezers?
