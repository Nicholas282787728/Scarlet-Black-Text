Scarlet and Black

Every Coin has Two Sides

John Newmark

Last week i read something in
the Des Moines Register that her
riiied me. 0i course, that probably
comes as no surprise to you.
Almost every week i start oii my
column by saying that something
new has put tear or horror into my
heart. i guess aiter a while it might
seem that i am scared by almost
anything. You might begin to think
that i see the worst in everything
that occurs. That could be said to
be partially true. Due to three
years oi experience in high~school
debate, 1 can oiten see both sides oi
an issue, the best and the worst
aspects. When this happens i will
oiten have a horrible time ii iorced
to decide which argument is cor
rect. when someone asks me what
my opinions are on a certain issue,
i hate to have to answer, “I'm not
sure.” However, when i can
understand the arguments oi
multiple viewpoints, i oiten have
no other choice.

Last weekend i read an article in
the Des Moincs Register about an
Iowa Supreme Court deci ’on.
Though this was a state decision,
and not national, there is no reason
to believe that the belieis oi the
justices are any diiierent irom
those oi the members oi any other
state supreme court in the nation.
The court decided it should be legal
ior doctors to sterilize mentally ill
patients without the patients con-
sent. Apparently, there was once a
law in lowa that stated a doctor
could sterilize any criminal or
mentally ill patient without the par
tieni's consent, That was removed
a number oi years ago. Without
any laws regarding involuntary
sterilization, parents have recently
been bringing their children in ior
sterilization ior a variety oi
reasons. A new law naturally had
to be written which would outline
when involuntary sterilization
could occur. The obvious answer is
never. Control over one‘s iertility

should be an inalienable right
belonging to any citizen, criminal,
mentally ill, or otherwise.
Naturally, there must be another
side to this question, or else the
lowa Supreme Court would have
unanimously voted against in
voluntary sterilization. A iormer
teacher of mine once told his class
a story about a trip he once made
tor his church. He had volunteered
to bring some donated road to a
iamily which was receiving chari-
ty irom the church. Aiter he knocks
ed on the door, the mother and
father invited him in, and he notic-
ed that they had approximately
eight or nine kids and the mother
was pregnant. Aiter a low ques-
tions, he discovered that the two
had no idea how a husband and
wiie go about having babies; ior
them it just happened. Since they
had no idea what they were doing,
there was no way it was going to
stop. The question is. oi course.
should at least one of the two be
sterilized so that they couldn't
have any more children? They
were both mentally retarded and
there was little chance anybody
could have explained why it was
necessary, so the process would
have had to be involuntary. Was it
unethical, or the only humane
thing to do?
_ The court decision leit it open ior
future cases to decide when
sterilization should be used. All the
court declared last week was that
the option was there. However, the
option was only given‘in cases iris
volving mentally ill patients. This
seems to say that doctors can’t
sterilize a criminal involuntarily.
This might upset some who are in
favor of castration as a form oi
punishment ior rapists. Whether
this is cruel and unusual punishr
ment or whether this is a punish-
ment that {its the crime isn’t a difr
iicult question ior me to decide. i
am against permanent and iinal

. eiiectively we do that here at Grins
nell, and i wonder how sincere the
administration is in saying that we
should question authority.

A number oi incidents have caUSr
ed me to have doubts on these
issues. First was an occurrence
that happened last year wherein it
was suggested by an American.
siudies proiessor that iile is a
disease created by th A to allow
the United States to subjugate
the continent oi Airica As incredlr
ble as this idea seems. what is even
more incredible is the iarl that no
one involved in this incident pres
tested. its not easy to stand up to a
proiessor or denounce what one
says, but this was nonsense and
there was no outcry.

Equally surprising has been the
lack oi outcry among large por-
tions oi the student body on the
reluctance oi the administration to
push the trustees ior a large hiring
program to accompany the col»
lege's move to 372. with the move
to 3-2. the curriculum oiierings are
going to drop by to percent. To
make up ior this, the college needs
to create 16 new Iuilrtime positions,
instead, they are creating three.
Three is certainly better than
none, but the policy is still
nonsense. Grinnell nccds addi-
tional iaculty. For 1200 students
this college has 105 iaculty
members, compare that to Swar-
thmore. which has 143 iaculty
members ior a student population
oi roughly the same size. Further-
more, Grinnell has the money to
engage in signiiicant iaculty hire

ings, and the idea or adding on 16
new positions is not radical.
Pomona added 14 positions when
they moved to 3-2 in the ’70:. Clear-
ly the idea or moving to 372 without
signiiicant iaculty hirings is
nonsense, yet only a handiui oi
students turned out to petition the
trustees ior more iaculty. Some
people who i talked to said they
just weren't interested.

Another spot oi nonsense that
has attracted little attention is the
iact that the college does not plan
to hire another person to iill the
women's history position in the
history department. ii Grinnell is a
iorward»thinking and comprehenr
sive institution, this is a position
that cannot simply be leit uniilled.
As an atrocity ior a liberal college
it would rank second only to
Carleton's complete abandonment
oi women's studies in 1984. Yet
about this issue there has only been
scattered protest, What is even
more interesting, though, is that on
this issue and others like it (in-
cluding the 3-2 issue), the ad
ministration has not been recep-
tive to what comments, questions,
and protests there have been. it is
because oi this that i doubt the ads
ministration's sincerity in joining
in on the cry to “question authori-
ty,"
it is understandable ior the ads
ministrators oi the college to ieel
that as paid proiessionals, they are
the most able to run the school
along the lines that are best ior it;
however, ii they are really serious
about making Grinnell a place ior

punishment ior any crime. The
chances of inflicting an innocent
person is too high. The us,
criminal-justice system was set up
on the belie! that it is better DO let a
guilty person go iree than to cons
vict one who is innocent. That is
what we mean by the phrase “inno-
cent until proven guilty.” 1 am
against the death penalty, castra-
tion, or any other punishment that
is impossible to reverse.

While the court was right, in my
opinion, not to extend involuntary
sterilization to criminals, there is
still the question oi whether docs
tors have the right to sterilize
anybody involuntarily. There may
be cases where it seems the best
and most proper thing to do.
However, it a person doesn‘t have
Control over his or her own fertili-
ty, what does he or she have con
trol over? 15 this a case at the
government going too far into the
private lives or its citizens? Or
must the government occasionally
interfere in order to protect the
saiety and general weliare oi the
nationi i am not sure oi my
answer. In the Declaration of in-
dependence we are told that
among our inalienable rights are
“life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness." Control over our
bodies must [it under one of those
three headings. However, that line
is not in the Constitution.

who have no idea what they are do-
ing. keep having more and more
children, even though they are well
below poverty line and are being
supported by the rest oi the nation
through weliare and charity? What
is the answer? As much as I hate
the words, “I’m not sure."

academic inquiry, they must not
only expect, but encourage,
students to question what is going
on around them at all levels, Drake
in his response to Bennett suggests
that this is the case at Grinnell,
and ior him i don’t doubt that it's
true. However, i question the col-
lege's willingness to consider in a
serious light the concerns oi
students, The ilippant dismissal oi
the group oi students who did turn
out to express concern over the
lack oi a iaculty increases in mOVr
ing to 3-2 is one oi the reasons why i
have doubts. At that incident, vice
president Walker, when told that
we were there to ask ior more
iaculty, replied sarcastically, ”I’ll
bet you are." i don‘t like attacking
Mr. Walker, who has always been
very kind to me, but episodes like
this suggest an unwillingness on
the part oi the administration to
really allow ior divergent voices.

it is oiten hard much oi the time
even to iind the time to stand up
and cry ioul at what is going on
around us. All oi us are busy and
have lots oi homework. And it is
not very easy ior administrators to
stop and open themselves up to
criticism ior the sake oi encourag-
ing students to question authority,
but i hope that in reading this lets
ter, both administrators and
students will remember that, con-
trary to what William Bennett
would have us believe, questioning
and allowing ior questions at all
levels are essential elements in
becoming educated. 7 Steve

“It's better to look good than to

With these words Billy Crystal
summed up the message oi the has
and turned my stomach all in the
same breath. while i am told that
his lines are supposed to be iunny
because they are sarcastic, it
seems that they have been taken as
gospel throughout the decade — a
sad thing indeed, and perhaps it's
nothing new. .

Fashion seems just one more
way ior people to pass judgment on

a means oi sell-expression, but
people are not equally endowed
with the ﬁnances to stock a War

pressiveness" is a iunction oi
wealth. The iascination with brand
names is particularly disturbing,

can be construed as chic; they are

A woman whom I greatly like
and respect brought this to my air
tention beiore Christmas. She was
very lonely and more than a little
unhappy. i couldn't understand
why such an intelligent, lovely
woman would have trouble making
iriends or iinding Company, She is
witty and caring and very good
with people. i pressed her on why
she had so iew iriends in her peer
group, and she answered almost in
a whisper: “The ones I've met,
they're all nerds.”

i was at once taken aback and

saddened. but didn't know what to
say, Here was this woman, whom i
thought the world of (and still thlnk
highly of), dividing the world into
the cool people and the nerds. How
could I have told her that it was all
a big lie, that people are people
regardless oi their appearance?
How could I have explained that
personalities are what matter ,
and that appearances are just that

But appearances are in, and pens
ple are out.
