On the Verge, journeying through space and time

by Rebecca Foley and Dan
Capone

“l have seen the future, and it
is slang."

So said Fanny, and, as the
evening progressed onwards, she
proved herself to be right. for the
theatre department's latest play,
On the Verge by Eric Overmyer,
ts, in part, about the breakdown
and deimcmentof language. it is
also combines cultural
commentary with fanciful
reinterpretation of the past.

The play begins in 1888 with
three Victorian women explorers
journeying into the unknown, in
search of what they call “Terra
Incognito," the last remaining bit
of unexplored earth. As they
travel, the explorers, Fanny
(played by Karin McEwen),
Alexandra (Piney Janik), and
Mary (Barbara Brown), discover
many strange and unusual things:
they ﬁnd themselves using terms
they have never heard of before
(“The Red Chinese," “air mail."
“meltdown,” “ground zero"); they
encounter strange objects, things
they’ve never seen before, such as
eggbeaters; and they find
themselves having odd cravings
for unknown things, like Cool

Mary at last tathoms the
reason for their strange behavior:
as they travel through the jungle,
the mighty jungle, they are also

further in time, their speech
likewise changes. For Terra

continuum. involving space and

deducing from artifacts and ruins
what life would have been like in

substance called “Cool Whip."
Soon, however, the characters
must make up their minds as to
whether to continue in their
trekking expedition or to remain
in 1955. Two of thorn decide to
stay. One of them however,
decides to go on, and we leave her
as she is about to leave, unsure
of where she’s going, but
knowing that the worlds she
travels are not just outside, but
also inside ones,

The play, directed by Jan
Czechowski anti assistant-directed
by Kirk Everist, was well worth
the cold trek to the fine-arts
building. It was wildly
enjoyable, thanks to Overmyer’s
sharp dialogue and hilarious
performances by McEwen, Janik,
and Brown. Corrie Zoll likewise
demonstrates talents in his por-
trayal of various male characters.

Czechowski chose this play
after looking for over a year for a
play that had a number of good

The real work comes once
you get a place, whether college-
owned or not Remember how
awed you were by your feeling of
independence during your first
few months as a freshman?
That‘s the same feeling you get
when you move into an
apartment, And then you have to
do the dishes. Most places don‘t
come equipped with dishwashers,
but cleaning up your own mess
or assigning dish~washing days
helps. Other household duties
abound. Sometimes you almost
wish you could put a work order
in. It‘s best to decide how you‘ll
split housework and cons before
the semester starts Remember,
you can‘t put in for a room
change if you live off campus.

Have you ever thought how
much you’ve changed since the
day Mom and Dad dropped you
off at Grinnell'.7 Your values also
begin to change when you live
off campus Amid the wonder
and awe of a world awaiting, and

roles for women and provided
him an opportunity to work with
a small cost (the last production
he directed was last year's The
Rivals, which involved quite a
large cast), “We have a lot of
good actresses here now,"
Czechowski explained, “and plays
with good women's roles are hard
to find. I saw this one, liked its
description, and ordered several
copies, and here we are now."
Czechowski feels that the
point of all the fuss with
language in the play is not ”that
the quality of language in the
19th Century is better or worse
(than more modern usage), just
different. It comes through that
there is an evolution." Some
have pointed to this evolution in
language brought out in the play
to pejorative.

showing in the Flanagan Arena

Theatre through Feb. 26. All
performances begin at 8 p.m.
Tickets, available at the Forum
desk, are required due to the
limited seating available in Arena
