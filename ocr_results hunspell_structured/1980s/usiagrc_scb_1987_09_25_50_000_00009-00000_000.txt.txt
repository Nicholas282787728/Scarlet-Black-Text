A liberal campus--

The human element

“A woman was screaming. The big engine was still

became hypnotized by the dim
glint of the lamps suspended over
the bar, ﬂashing pinpoints oi light

oi ice cubes and rum and Coke. He

it was a reliei oi sorts, ior it
replaced that sick ieeling, that
deep wrenching in his abdominals
when he thought oi . the sunlight
blazing off the win 5 ield like a
star burst, his right foot instinc-
tively slamming the brake pedal
down . . .

The pain was more than
physical, He tilted the glass up,
gulping at the liquid greedily, His
innards buzzed and cramped.

The bartender breezed past, igr
noring the half-slumped man who
[or the past three or more hours
had drank slowly but steadily.
Pete's was a policy clearcut and
dry: “Long as ya don' yell or raise
hell an’ ya don' pass out, yer
welcum here " Pete was a
businessrminded bartender: sleep~
ing drunks only took up seats
where paying customers should be.
It was a familiar sight 7 Pete
deputizing a random patron, the
two men liiting the sleeping
drinker into their cradled arms,
the crowd parting as the men made
straight for the door to dump the
guy awkwardly to the pavement...

V For women he called a cab.

Their re-entry would be met with
cheers and catcalls. Pete really
was a [air guy; his assistant would
be rewarded with a drink on the
house.

Pete made his rules clear to all
new (aces, and Vince was no dii-
ierent. Vince just nodded solemnly
and perched himself on a stool, All
he wanted was to be left alone,
which suited Pete just fine.
Besides, he didn’t like the look in
the guy’s eyes; they reilected vi-
sions oi death, close up and per
sonal.

The lights blurred. Vince caught
himseli thinking again. There were
moments when his mind was like
an intricate web, his attention a
ianged spider skittering across the
strands oi memory intent on the
kill. The day’s events struggled,
entangled and panicked. The bite.

A woman was screaming. The
big engine was still running, Vince
climbed down from the lofted cab
of the street cleaner, unconscious
1y tucking in his shirt; the city had
dress codes ior its employees. The
light was green but traiiic was but
tlenecked, as drivers craning their
necks slowed to get a better view.

”What the hell?" was all he
could think. There was that temr
porary blindness up in the cab, but
he'd stopped when he saw a man in
a suit jump out in the road ahead oi
him waving his arms frantically.
Then there was that woman screa-
ing..,lle was nervous.

Vince walked around the front of
the machine. A woman in slacks
and a white blouse stood on the
Sldewalk, A group or five or six
people milled around her, She had

her hands balled and was clutching
them to her mouth, as if she was
about to be sick. And then Vince
saw the legs, contorted and stick-
ing out irom under the cleaner, A
crumpled wheelchair was a few
feet back. He walked a little fur-
ther. The woman’s skull was
crushed, The tissue glistened laint~
1y on the asphalt.

He iroze, staring. He could not
stop.

Behind him the woman hiccuped
through her tears. l-ier words were
choppy, but understandable,
“i...saw himmm.,rkill,r.her.i,on
pur, us," She sobbed again,
“l...s w,..himl”

Something inside of him lurched.
He ran.,..

Faces loomed up in iront oi him
as he stumbled through the bar
crowd, clutching his stomach. He
reached die bathroom and burst in-
side. A man urinating standing up
said, “Shitll” as he started and
missed, and Vince careened off one
of the stall doors. He went down on
his knees as he spewed into the
bowl, again and again.

The convulsions stopped. He
wiped the sweat from his pale lace
with his right hand, the left still
clutching the toilet seat. Without
warning, his body hitched again,
and vomit flew.

Minutes later he sat facing the
stool. The twisting in his guts was
still there, writhing and eating
away, The reeling oi sickness
stayed.

it wouldn't go away...ior a long,
long time.

Th5 is the firm! “Human Element."
It's been fun. Than/ts /or reading.

 

What Biden is guilty of

Last week I wrote a column on
the iaults oi Supreme Court
nominee Robert Bork, It was
basically centered around his

, belief that the right to privacy is
not included in the Constitution. In
order to be fair and impartial, this

curred within the past month
Biden’s character has been
brought under scrutiny because he
has been accused of lifting other
politicians' speeches for his own
use and not attributing the proper
credit. Biden claims the lack of at
tribution was accidental, Showing

.as evidenoe other speeches where

:JOl in Nmeark he used the same quotes along with

_ week i will examine the present
_ coniusion surrounding Democratic
candidate and Senate Judiciary
Committee head Joseph Biden,
and the charges oi plagiarism
against him. i will ignore the ac
cusation made against him while
he was attending Syracuse Univer-
. sity Law School: when Judging a
person's character, one must eXr
amine only the evidence dealing
with his current belieis. Unfor-
tunately, however, the Syracuse
University Law School incident is
not the only charge against Biden
There appear to be some recent ex»
amples, also 7 ones that have ocr

the proper attribution. while some
may claim this is no excuse, that
Biden still committed the acts oi
plagiarism, they are missing the
basic argument. There is no ques
tion as to what Biden did. when
there is a tape recording oi both
Biden's speech and the speech
irom which he borrowed, there can
be little argument ior his in-
nocence, The debate is over his in-
tent,

li Biden can show that his
iailures to attribute quotes were
unintentional mistakes, then there
is no ﬂaw in his character, except
that he is human and does make
mistakes, However, ii Biden inten-
tionally liited the quotes, changed
a iew words, and tried to pass them

all as his own, then there exists a
question regarding his character
and integrity. Since Eiden can
show times where he used the
same word and remembered to at
tribute, it follows that Biden at
least intended to attribute the
quotes in the instances which he
did not, Supporting this is the [act
that many of the texts he handed
out to the press at the speeches in
question included attributions
themselves There seems little
doubt that the intent his opponents
are trying to iind does not exist.

With the question of character
answered. let’s return to his in
nocence, AS said earlier, there is
little argument for Eiden’s inr
nocence since the evidence is prac-
tically irrefutable. The argument
that does exist, however, is
whether or not plagiarism is ac-
tually an immoral act

By today's standards it is, but
this has not always been the case.
in 1832. a German philosopher said
that “at bottom it is pure silliness
[to inquirelwhether a man have

. Every year, each up
per class whines about how this
edition of freshmen look like rub-
ber stamps ui each other. Actually,
I was the one who made that acr
cusation, probably a little extreme
considering that the most pro-
gressive thing about myseli is my
showy litue earring. Still, 1 think
that the moaning or the elders has
some basis to it

Luc Hailestad

When I came to Grinnell as a
prospective in the spring oi 1985, i
had already visited Lawrence and
Claremont-McKenna, The latter,
by the way, is located just outside
Los Angeles. so i was already
under considerable peer pressure
to stay the hell away irom iowa,
But oi course I came anyway. lt
was one oi those mid-April Fridays
when small armies oi welldressed
young Americans descend on Quad,
parents in tow, and take up all the
table space irom those unicrtunale
enough to have ll o’clock classes.
This particular day was even more
notable because it was a week
before Relays and the weather was
periect. For those oi you unaware,
there is an unwritten code in Grin-
nell that stipulates that on days
such as this one, afternoon classes
are canceled due to lack of attenr
dance,

This day was no exception. As i
sat in my designated circle oi
iellow high~schonlers and friendly
and iniormative undergrads, l was
struck by how diiierent each stu»
dent was irom his peers, Granted,
when you're outside the ionim
you’re bound to see more uni-
queness oi appearance than in
most places on campus, but the
dichotomy oi the students was un»
mistakable. A short time later so
meone tapped a keg outside oi the
South Lounge, where the parents
were gathered. Parched though I

was, i mustered a little willpower,
not too difficult when I considered
that if Mom made me wear thse
cheesy pressed pants and dress
shirt, she probably wouldn‘t take
too kindly to throwing back a
Hardee's cup.

Without a doubt, my visit as a
prospective Sold me on the idea of
going to Grinnell. rm not saying
that a keg oi beer swayed me away
from another school, but i men-
tioned it to illustrate the kind of oc-
currence that used to be fairly uni»
que to this school, Obviously the
new drinking law prohibits us irom
doing iun things, like taking a keg
outside, but it seems as if the law
coupled with that damn US News
article has triggered a shiit in the
ideology oi the administration.
Now each lreshman class must be
a little smarter. a little richer than
the previous one. People that are
raised in wealthy environments
are usually brought up under more
conservative philosophies. Sudden
1y everyone wants to be an econ
major. Nothing against them,
some oi my best iriends are econ
majors. But i gota D in econ, soI'll
go ahead and show a little bias.

The thing about this rash oi
business—oriented minds is that
those iields oi study are geared
away from social consciousness,
something present in the average
liberal mind. It was that attitude,
of the students and the professors,
mat allowed us to be number nine
in the first place, I see that liberal
irame oi mind as being
downplayed by the administration
in the recent months. l'm not ques-
tioning anyone‘s character. For
the record, i would love to make a
substantial amount ol money, Butl
have to wonder if me school is
sacriiicing its ideals in order to
raise its status. Tombstones and
copper-lined loggias look classy,
but schools gain prestige through
continued periormance and
adherence to an ideology, not
through an improved cosmetic ap
pearance.

 

 

Stridents Strain/ town
and gown relations

To the Editor:

In the last issue of the Scarlet
and Black, there were opposing
opinions expressed over the issue
oi the Soul Asylum concert,
However, neither Mr. Hatlestad
nor Mr, Berger addressed the most
serious aspect of the event: town
and gown relations, I do not agree
that the actions taken by the
students present at the concert
were pseudosos radicalism or
anarchy, Besides, what was wrong
with the sixties? Further, Luc,
college—owned property is private,
not public 1 belleve that although
many students who were present
expressed their anger at the
premature end oi the concert, they
did not become, with the possible
exception of a few, violent or
belligerent. Questioning authority
in a nonviolent manner Is not im~

proper. i could draw endless
parallels to various civil rights
leaders and our own founding
lathers, but the chief concern here
is town and gown relations,

It has become all too apparent in
this as yet young semester that
there is growing animosity on the
campus towards the permanent
residents of Grinnell. I think it is
important to remember that
although we pay tuition to be here,
the college does not own the town
We are merely guests of some very
tolerant, hospitable, and in
teresting people On numerous oer
casions I have overheard the con-
Versations oi students reierring to
“those damn townies,” and, pay
close attention juniors and scniors,
