Wolfe

I don't think I could come up with anything
better if you gave me till l990...(r0yal
decade) sums up the business of naked.
over-blatant pursuit or money and status.
It's very much like what I’ve read about
the 19205. That’s not to say that the stock
market is going to crash — it could. The
thing that makes this a little different is
that there are so many young people.
especially in New York, who expect to
make a great deal of money by the time
they‘re thirty...and they do it. Few oi them
go to jail. n a way the ass and 705 were
an aberration. It was very unfashionable
in the late 60s or early 705 {or an educated
person to be blatant in revealing his or her
ambition or desire for social rank. They
would be heralded the “debutante in blue
jeans.”

You would actually see debutantes from
Miss Porter's show up to an interview in
blue jeans and a blue workshirt'and talk
about how they were spending their
weekends down at the daycare center tak-
ing care oi underprivileged children.

Scarlet and Black:

in your cartoon “The Man Who Always
Peaked Too Soon,” you trace the life or a
man who lives three years ahead ol the
times, What is he doing right now?

Wolfe: \

Probably he would be into a very antique
mode. surrounding himsell with antique
things, adopting antique attitudes, trying
to get the 20th Century out of his life.
Scarlet and Black:

Your book ”The Electric Kool-Aid Acid
Test” has become a sort oi Bible for LSD
users, How do you feel about this in
lluence?

Wolfe:

All, that’s quite an achievement. I might
say that I was appalled when the book
came out and I would get letters for drug
guidance. I remember one student who
wrote me that he‘d been thrown oil the
school newspaper for writing that George
Washington had grown marijuana and
asked me to Send him documentation to
prove that Washington had grown marl-
juana, In fact he had grown hemp — to
make rope. i can see that I have now
become a “Dear Abby” [or the druggies. I
also found people who are giving their
children “The Electric Kooerid Acid

Test” and say, “Read this and see what
can happen to you." It depends on what
way you look at the story. In a way I take
them both as a sort oi tribute because my
attempt in that book was to get inside the
central nervous system o[ the people I was
Writing about and to write it inside out,
rather than to, get on a hill and comment on
that world. I think my conclusion to be
rather ambiguous. in the end, Ken Kesey
sits on an old barn playing electric guitar,
chanting, “We blew it. We blew it. We blew

Scarlet and Blac . p38

Alter seeing the workings of the
American space program while resear-
ching “The Right Stuit," do you think
NASA will be able to recover from the
Challenger accident?

.Woll'e:

I think they will. They'll do its lot (aster
if the Russians come up with something
spectacular. That's what got them going in
the first place. The problem NASA's
always had is that there is no philosophy
{or why we should go into space, what it is
all about. We were always responding to a
challenge by the Russians....Later when it
came time to get money from Congress for
this and that, NASA had no arguments ex-
cept for the very practical things, likelook
at the things we brought you ‘ pens that
write in zero gravity and Tang. It seems to
me they should have been developing a
philosophy,

Scarlet and Black:

How do you think the New York social
scene will be affected by Andy Warhol‘s
death?

Wolfe:

It won‘t change at all because all of his
children are out there. He was really an in-
tellectual, not an artist. He created an at
titude a whole new attitude, a whole new
attitude for artists and also intellectuals.
The work that he is remembered for is all
existing images either put in multiples or
colors .,.Instead of the [traditional] in
tellectual approach, Warhol’s approach
was that “everything is so tacky and I love
it." He was turning all artistic values up
Side down, but at the same time positions
ing himself above it. You can have your
cake and eat it too. And that’s how all the
young artists in New York are children of
Andy Warhol. It’s an art game. You’re on
artist and a Bohemian at the same time.

It's an intellectual game 7 this is dread-
ful that’s why I like it..,.I remember once
going to a Rolling Stones concert [with
Warhol]. This was when the Rolling Stones
first came to the United States. They were
so little known then that they had the cons
cert in a movie house. They had an
underground reputation of being like the
Beatles, but Wilder. There were a number
at groups that were on before the Rolling
Stones One of them had two women wear-
ing pink taiieta dresses, Warhol said,
“Look! Party dresses! Party dresses!”
And this idea of the party dress that the
girls used to wear in their teens exited him
because it’s so tacky it’s wonderful.
Scarlet and Black:

How do you discipline youseli to write?
Wolfe: ‘

I try to force myseli to do ten pages a
day (2000 words). I have lound that Ijust
have to do that, Just force it out day by
day. it you decide to write when you reel
right, the days don't come often enough.
That is the hardest part about this kind of
life, making yourself work
