It’s time to decide

We started with tour declared, candidates and two strong»
writein campaigns. Three elections later, we have two can-
didates and a race that no one can win, Something is obviously
wrong.

There are several courses that the election can take from
here (See the article on the opposite page ) Another election at
some point in the future' 15 a good possibility. Whether that elec-
tion will be followed by yet another 15 something that will have
to be decided by the student body.

Many people are upset by the continuing sequence of e1ec~
tions. Some have quit voting, others have turned to writing in
any name for a joke. Both forms of behavior simply contribute
to the continuation of elections and create even more
dissatisfaction.

Unless writein votes are disqualified, people are going to
have to start voting for the recognized candidates There are
only two left. The others have all had their chance, and none of
them has continually carried enough support to remain a viable
contender in the election. However, in combination with the
joke votes, they have managed to tum a close race, usually con—
sidered desirable in a democratic process, into a no winvsitua~
tion.

If another runoff election comes, vote, Vote for a candidate

_ listed on the ballot, someone who is actually running in the elec-

tion. The jokes and the write-ins have been fun, but let’s let SGA
get back to work,
