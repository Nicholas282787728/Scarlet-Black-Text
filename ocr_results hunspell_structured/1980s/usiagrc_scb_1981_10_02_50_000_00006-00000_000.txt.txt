CBS. hosts Gospel Music

Extravagenza Saturday
Y.G.B. to perform varied gospel program

by Seth Meisel

This Saturday at 7 p.m., Herrick Chapel
will host C,B.S.’s Gospel Music Ex-
travaganza. Performing separately will be
Grinnell’s Young, Gifted and Black Gospel
Choir, Iowa State University‘s The Gospel
Innovators and The University of Iowa‘s
The Voices of Soul.

Chris Johnson, organizer of the event,
said that though most of the music will be
traditional gospel. there should be a great
variety of sounds from the groups. This is
especially evident because the group sizes

range irom Iowa State University’s ninety
member choir to Grinnell‘s chair at
twelve. A reception in Gardner lounge
will follow the ninety minute performance.

Although Grinnell‘s Young Gifted and
Black Gospel Choir won’t approach the
other two schools in size, YGB Director
Richard Winston is positive that in quality
it is on equal terms. winston cites the
choir’s familiarity with their music as one
asset. Traditionally, YGB first con-

The monument
Amhersons

Directed by Orson Welles, 1942; 88 min.
Starring Joseph Cotten. Agnes Moorehead.
Anne Baxter.

Adapted from the novel
Tarkington.

Sat, 8 pm , ARH; Sun., 3.30 a.m., SL.

The Magnificient Ambel'sons, Orson
Welles‘ second film, is in some ways
similar to hi f'rst. the great Hollywood
masterpiece Citizen Kane. Both films deal
Wih specific American themes and both
are directed in the unusual. highly stylized
manner that characterizes Welles.

The film is set against the social
upheaval of the early 19005 and deals with
a rich midwestern family, the Ambersons.
With the rise of industrialism and the rise
to power of its proponents, the high status
of the Ambersons as descendents of the
town’s founders and as wealthy lan~
downers is threatened, On a personal
level, the film plots the family’s downfall,
iocusing on the son, George, who

by Booth

represents the last of the arrogant
aristocracy, slowly becoming out of place
in his own town

Though criticized by many as somewhat
unbalanced (Welles blamed this on studio
Cutting without his Permission), the film is
still one of Wclles greatest Works. The
ingenious and vigorous setting of scenes,
the tascinating effects of editing and
camera angle and the almost obsessive
highrcontrast lighting beautifully
reﬂecting the psychology of the characters
,, zlll that Welles is famed for is embodied
in The Magnificient Amhersons. ,7 John

Thr . spcct is a good example of the
work of director Robert Siodmak, who
directed some of the most chilling films

centrates on learning about music and
vocal technique. Winston explained,
“Performances for us are not Hie most
important thing. We get together to learn
music through something we’ all share in
common—gospel. As director, my goal is
to first teach music."

To facilitate this learning, Winston tries
to provide the chair with a wide repertoire.
allowing for exploration of many different
types of gospel music. Also, he has begun
to tape practices so that members can

“equivocal, obsessed with pathology
illness and depravity. llc seemed at once
to be the cinema’s morbid pathologist and
a slick extortionist ot thrills."

This extremely well-acted and
suspenseful film involves a henpecked
husband who falls in love with a younger
woman and plots to do away with his wife.
Plot twists, the emphasis on the
psychology of murder and the added
complexity of a detective sympathizing
with his suspect have caused this thriller
to becompared to the work of Hitchcock

learn to critically analyze music and
decide how to best improve their sound by
hearing themselves.

Narration, dramatic expression and
”little kid music" are three areas where
the choir is now working. Narration may
complement some traditional songs
allowing for a broadened interpretation.
Winston defined dramatic expression to
simply be a greater diversity that will
provide performances with more ”ups and
downs.”

Performance, of course, is hardly
ignored. As Winston explained, “It gives
the Choir 3 chance to put their learning in
action. ” The choir performs extensively in
Grinnell especially at the Congregational,
Methodist and Lud’ieran churches, It also
goes to secular functions here such as the
Elks’ or secretary banquets,

While their big tours are usually
reserved for spring break, the choir may
perform throughout Iowa at various times
during the school year. On campus, YGB
has scheduled its annual Christmas show
for Nov. 28.

For those of you in the mood for an in-
tense. magnificient film, look no further
than Eugene O'Neill’s Long Day's Journey
into Night. It is U'Neill’s‘ largely
autobiographical tragedy ot the ,Tyrone
tamily whose relationships vacillate
between love and hate, guilt and pride It‘s
the type oi movie you never forget.

As the pathetic mother battling a drug
addiction, l-lcpburn is stunning, giving one
of the finest portrayals of her later career.
Hers is probably one of the most
devastating performances offered by an
American actress.

Andotcoursc. the superior script is pure
Eugene O'Neill, one which he called a
“play of old sorrow, written in tears and
blood." Indeed, that accuratelydescrihes
this film — this unrelenting unﬂinching
story ofa hunted family. Itis a somber and
moving drama and one of the few film
adaptations of an O’Neill script where the
original ﬂavor is retained When this
movie hits, it hits hard. It is not a movie to
see if you're looking for a light en-
tertaining film. But, if you’re a tan of
O'Neill's and up for the experience don't
miss this drama. _ Catherine lngrassia
