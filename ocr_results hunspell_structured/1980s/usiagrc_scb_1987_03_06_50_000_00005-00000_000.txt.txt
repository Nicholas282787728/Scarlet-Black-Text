“There’s more out there than just Mad

treet Wine Cellar. Jeff Phelps. So, when a
ew Grinnell College students came in to
sk‘ about the possibility of a WinthaSting

lass, Jeff was enthusiastic.

“I think there’s a tremendous range oi
experience with wine, I'm really excited
about Wine and can‘t understand when no
oile else is. it goes with food. it’s a conver-
sation starter ..With hard liquor your
drink it and Just get drunk," said Phelps.

A beginning winertasting class was
started last semester and now these same
students have graduated into the advanced

proximately seven sessuons. sampling

Phelps began the class last semester
with a basic history of wine, later introduo
ing uc Davis' established winerrating
scale, Phelps' goal is to familiarize the
students with the differences between par
ticular grapes or the wines' countries oi
origin, and he also wants them to unders-
tand the criteria used in judging a good
wine from a bad one.

Phelps says that, at lirst, students
thought it was ridiculous that one wine
could be Considered better than another.
and he is eager to point out that taste in
wine is subjective.“1[ you don’t like the
wine, you don’t like it ” But he remarks
that as everyone began to understand the
criteria for ”good wine," tastes seemed to

"I wouldn't go out and buy a cheap Jug or
wine now.” says participant Nate
Schmiechen.

Enrique Menor even goes so tar as to say
that before taking the class he would never
even buy a bottle of wine because he would
not have known what to choose.

Why do the students take the class"
“Wine tastes really good and i wanted to
differentiate between the different kinds,”
says Enrique.

Warren Printz agrees, and mentions the
importance of the 50cm] aspect of the
class. “It's fun, it's a great way to spend a
Monday night when there isn't much elsc
going on "

This week, the advanced group of wine-
tasting students prepared a sixecourse
ltailan dinner complete with complemen-
ting italian wine at the offrcampus house
of Sarah Garrett. Jane Davidson, annd
Warren Printz. A fairly steady number of
about 10 students met at the house each
Monday night at B for one and a half to
two and a half hours to learn about wine,
to drink it, and to enjoy themselves.

A few of the students inquired last
semester about receiving credit tor the

restrictions on alcohol consumption, the
chart was dropped,

Vintner describes method
of wine shopping

by Jeti Phelps

What is Fine Wine? ls it always expen
sive'.’ Is one type better than another?
Answering questions like this can be tough
foria wine shop owner. Certainly, stan-
dards have been set in the wine industry as
in any other business; but with wine the
standards tend to change from country to
country. and from grape to grapel In Ger-
many, tor instance, most production is
geared toward sweet, white, fruity wines
made from the Riesling grape, while in the
Bordeaux region of France, the dry, blendr
ed red Clarets are king. The most impor-
tant thing is that you enjoy whatever wine
you choose to drink, whether the experts
call it “fine” or not,

‘The purpose of this column will be to pro-
Vlde you with the means to make com-
parisons between wines, to Show you how
to choose and use them, and to give you the
tools necessary [or you to chart your own
course through the world of wine, Now,
back to the questions at hand.

No! Fine wine need not be expensive! In
fact in recent years, there seems to be
very little relationship between the cost of
wine and the value of wine in either
Europe or the U.S. if a $4 wine is well
made, suits the occasion, and meets your
personal standards, then by all means en»
Jay itl A good case in point would be one
particular Cream Sherry produced in the
United States and sold at retail for less
than the price of a 5th of “Mad Dog.” At
me 1986 Orange County Fair (one of the
premiere wine-judging events in the
world) this sherry was blindrtasted
against the best and most expensive
American sherries — many priced 4 to 5
times higher 7 and came out on top. in
fact, it was Chosen as one of the 4 ‘Best of
Show’ wines out of 2700 total entries of all
types! one European judge refused to
-lieve he wasn’t sampling a line Jerez

tSpanish) sherry until he was taken on a
tour of the huge parent winery and tasted
the same sherry straight irom the oak! My
point is that a caretul shopper armed with
a little information and with some help
from a knowledgeable wine merchant
should be able to stay within a budget and
still experience the best wine available

Don't be afraid to ask for help when you
enter a wine shop. Most wine shop owners
want your business, and will be eager to
help you find something you might like,
whether you have so or $50 to spend.
Please don’t be embarassed, either.
Remember, the person selling you the
wine had to start. from scratch at some
point, too. Chances are, if the salesperson
acts like a “wine snub,” or sniffs at your
tastes or selection, she/he is probably try-
ing to hide a personal weaknesses in judg-
ing wines. ignore these people and go with
your own experience

It is also not true that fine wine Comes
irnm only one region or can be made irom
only one kind of grape. Each winee
producing region can make stunning
wines, and each region is capable of pro-
ducing champion “Swill" as well. As you
become more familiar with Wine, you will
be able to tell Hie difference; and most
likely, you will see your own tastes change
as you experiment.

Now, it you are convinced that what you
are used to drinking is the best. and you
see no reason to switch, well fine! More
power to you! Next time, you can skip over
this Column and rest secure in your choice.
it, however, you want to see what's out
there, are willing to make a few
“mistakes," and aren’t afraid to talk to a
wine merchant about your tastes and im-
pressions, you could be in tor a long, plea-
sant journey through the world ol fine

Personality Profile on

Hietala, not a
“whole person”

Name: Thomas Hietala
Iiirthdute: February 1, 1951

Who has had the greatest inﬂuence in your
life? My grandparents (my grandiather
came to the United States as a stowaway
on a ship lrom Yugoslavia when he was a
boy of 11 and went to work in the iron

‘ mines of Northern Minnesota); my
parents (both are very bright though
neither received a college education);
several teachers and proiessors (they im-
pressed upon me the value of imagination
and uncompromising integrity).

What did people think at you in high
school? In high school I was a club of one
because I was a serious student as well as
an athlete. But I was fortunate in the sense
that many of my triends in high school
were intelligent and gifted young women,
It sounds like a cliche, but they taught me
that a lot of inherited notions about gender
were absurd. That was a Valuable lesson to
learn in a workingclass culture.

What do you most hate to do? That ques
tion might be turned around a bit and
answered this way: I hate most not having
the time to do things that make me leel like
a whole person. Grinnell College demands
a great deal from its iaculty — there is lit
tle time during the semester for recrear
tional activities. I hate not having the time
to exercise, to play music, to have friends
over for dinner, to relax.
