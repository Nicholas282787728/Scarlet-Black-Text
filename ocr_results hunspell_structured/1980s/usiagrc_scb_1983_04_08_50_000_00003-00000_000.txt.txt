The Little Foxes -t1941. til. min.)

Lillian Hellman captures the spiritoi the
decaying South in The Little Foxes. The
Civil War has Just ended. and the South has
become a bitter battleground where once-
great estates and families lie in tatters. A
regal aristocracy that once revolved
around courtly ideals has become a
decrepit lineage rife with bitter intighting
and disputes. The setting is pertect tor the
crass northerner. confident and full of Vic»
tory. to ride into the South and take con-
trol,

The Little Foxes centers around one
lainily that is a microcosm for the entrie
generation. Bette Davis plays Regina, the
matriarch: cruel. calculating. hateful.
able to watch as her husband dies 3 slow
death. i-ierhert Marshall plays the rather.
a once proud man who is now sickly and
beaten. trying desperately to cling to some
shred of his sell-respect as he watches all
the attributes of his manhood being torn
away from him. Dan Duryea plays the
future. spoiled. insensitive. weak and
unable to understand that what was once
his birthright is now Just a hollow shell

The Little roves is a masterpiece of
i lung, acting (Bette Davis IS at her most
brilliant l and directing. William Wylei' is
so brutal in his honesty that the filln is ac
iually sometimes pomiul to watch The
death scene Is considered one of the most
brilliant scenes ever ruined: the expres
