The Development Ofﬁce

Dick Jenkins: The man behind its success

by Marllyn L Clark and Laura Carter

“Using unorthodox tactics that include
buying a television station and taking a
ilier on a speculative stock, Grinnell has
vastly expanded in endowment and coped
with inﬂation on campus."

So stated Fortune magazine in its Dec.
ls, 1913, issue. Now that the television sta-
tion has been sold for $35 million and the
flier in Intel stock was sold for $12 million,
the endowment has risen irom Fortune's
1978 figure of $37 5 to its current level of $86
million The endowment, or investment
portiolio, has grown mainly because‘ oi
“adroit management" and ”the stunning
appreciation at its assets,” said the
magazine But who are the masterminds
behind this phenomenal success? .

Much of this achievement can he at
tributed to the Board oi Trustees.
speciiically its Finance Committee, head
ed by Joe Rosenfleld and Warren Buffett.
rhcsc mo men. who have amassed their

own personal , fortunes, have extended
their financial expertise to raise Grinnell's
endowment to its present level. Although
Rosenfield and Buffett are the catalysts
behind some of the endowment gains, nie
dayrtoday solicitation and management or
the college's funds goes on within the of-
[ice of Development.

immediately upon arriving at the second
near or Macy House, one notices a dif-
ferent aunosphere. Instead of the hurried
pace of campus liie, the mood here is calm
and relaxed. Over the buzz and clatter of
typewriter keys runs a steady ilow oi con-
versation and laughter, The visitor is
greeted by one oi the seven people working,
in the outer room and directed to the opts"
door of Dick Jenkins, Vice-president for
development. Jenkin's handshake and
friendly attitude show his willingness to
discuss his office on an informal level and
instantly make the Visitor feel conﬂérr'

table. But why shouldn't he be willingto.
discuss the sucess of his office?

Jenkins, who has worked in the Develop-
ment Office since 1974 and assumed his
present position in 1930, graduated irom
Grinnell in 1939. Although “being an alum
helps but is not necessary," Jenkins' johiii
the Treaurer’s Office while a student in-
troduced him to the financial workings of
the college. When he first joined the office
he designed the Estate Planning program.
He now oversees the program and the
other two units of the office, Grants and
Annual Giving.

Jenkins attributed the growth of the en
dowment to a dramatic increase oi money
flow and the expansion of the Estate Plan-
ning Program. Because more money is
now in circulation, people are ac-
cumulating larger personal incomes and
are more able to give money to the college.
People are also more likely to contribute

make a contribution during their lifetime
and earn interest irom the college’s invest

However, of the $86 million endowment,
only the interest earned on the principal
deposited in various hanks and dividends
earned on investments are actually used
every year to pay the college's operating
costs This year the operating budget is

Grants Program

From their office in a far corner of the Development
cince, J, Kelly Yenser, director oi the Grants Pro-
gram, and Jack Robertson, associate director, watched
last year, as nearly $1‘/2 million came into the college
coffers. The role of the Grants Program “is exclusively
devoted to the pursuit of money," said Yenser. ”And we
got a lot more money last year than we ever have " 50
something is obviously going right in that hidden cor-
ner.

The money raised by the Grants Program is actually
a combination at gins made to the college by founda-
tions, the federal government and sources related to ﬁle
trustees. Within these first two divisions are further
subgroupings according to how Grinnell must earn this
money and how it must be spent. Yenser acknowledged
the complexity of the programs and explained, “It's
unclear, not by intention, but out of confusion,” The
division of work between Yenser and Robertson helps
ease this confusion. however, because Yenser is in
charge of the foundation monies and Robertson
oversees the tederal grants.

Foundations donated over $865,000 last year, accur»
ding to Yenser’s Aug. 31 report to President George
Drake. Of this total, $525,000 came from two sources.
Yenser said the college is able to accumulate such a
figure because Drake is willing to appear at foundations
and present proposals and also because a documented
need, the renovation of Hurling Library, could be
shown.

Last year's granm ranged from the amount of the
Mellon Grant to three separate gifts of $1,000 each, The
way the money is used varies, too. Most foundations
make meir gifts with the stipulation that the money be
used for one purpose. These grants are termed
“ratricted” and differ from the “unrestrictedH grants,
which the trustees can use for any project.

Federal grants made up about $564,000 of the dam-
tions gathered last year by the program and $401,000
came from a threeryear National Endowment for the
Humanities grant, However, this grant must be match
ed by other college fundrraising projects on a three tn
one ratio and the total generated by the grant will stand
at $1,443,000.

Robertson's job as head of the federal grants is three-
iold. Fiist, he keeps track of what the government is oi-
iering, He next notiiies the college community, then
waits for responses and tiles proposals with the govern
ment, Besides the NEH monies, last year's federal
fund-raising results included a $7,115 grant to faculty
members Dennis Perri and Mary Gibson from the Iowa
Humanities Board and a National Science Foundation
grant of $75,550. ’ ‘ ’

Annual Giving

Warren Reinecke is known to many students as the
man who helps organize the student telethon twice each
year. But students are not the only people to know
Reinecke, because his job as director of Annual Giving
puts him in contact with alumni, parents, corporations,
iriends of the college, townspeople and faculty
members,

Reinecke’s unit is in charge of the Annual Fund,
which Jenkins called “the bread and butter money we
need for every day," Last year the fund gathered
$900,000 to $1 million‘and includes money from all cons
siituencies that give “unrestricted” (not donated for a
particular purpose) amounts to help pay annual
operating costs,

The Annual Giving Program reaches the widest
variety of people oi all three Development Office units,
Alumni constitute the largest group that Annual Giving
works with, both in numbers and in the amount they
give to their alma mater each year. Statistics for
190081 show that 33 percent of all living alumni donated
and meir total contribution was $453,011).

Corporations rank second in contributions last year at
$119,000, “Some of this is in grants," Reinecke explain-
ed, “But most of it is matching gitts, which match con-
tributions made to the school by the business'
employees."

Last spring's Town and Gown campaign garnered
$66,000 for the Annual Fund. Through this program,
residents of Grinnell who are not connected to the col-
lege can donate money. Some taculty contributions are
also included in Town and Gown, Friends of the college
who are not affiliated with the school donate a share,
too, The amount they contributed in the past year was
5530». Parents' giits. beyond payment oi students
fees, followed the friends‘ amount at $51,000.

The Annual Fund Telemon is another important way
in which the program solicits donations. Here, students
call alumni, parents and friends to follow up earlier ap-
peals, “This way the efficiency is greatest.“ said
Reinecke. “Also it is more personal and the people get
to find out what’s going on by talking to current
students.” This fall’s telethon will be held Nov, 917 and
is headed by Scott C. Ross,

A challenge grant from the Chicago-based Joyce
Foundation has greatly increased the telethon‘s gains
The first Joyce Challenge ran last year and contributed
$100,000 by adding to the amounts given by new and in»
creased donors. The program was renewed for this year
and will add another $100,000 if members of the Board of
Trustees will also donate $100,000 from meir own per-
sonal funds.

Estate Planning

The Estate Planning Program of the Development
Office at Grinnell focuses its attention on contacting
people who attended the college prior to 1942, to inquire
about gifts through bequests and charitable trusts,
Sarah Stafford. director of Estate Planning, described
these two types of giits as “techniques for planning a
person’s estate in a way to give support to the college "

E‘rom the time the couege was tounded, bequests
have contributed to the endowment. A bequest is a pro
vision in a person's will which includes the college and
which becomes eiiective upon the person's death.
charitable trusts, however, have only been in operation
for a brief period of time, “Since 1969 when the LES.
said it was possible to get tax beneiits irom the trusts,"
said Staiiord, “people have been able to make large
contributions of at least $5,000 to the college while they
are still alive." A person can agree to make a gift which
the college men invests, During the person's lifetime he
receives at least five percent interest accrued annually
irom the principal held in trust.

Stafford’s work in Estate Planning includes sending
out information to people about these two types oi giits
and then iollowing up by mail or travel on any inquiries
people may have about them, She emphasized the ime
portance of making initial contacts with people and
staying in touch because, for example, “It usually takes
irom two to six years of talking to someone before they
sign a charitable trust,"

Stafford attributed the growth of me endowment to
“good investment and adding money through Eswte
Planningl" At the close of 198081 $235,000 was obtained
irom charimble trusts and $292,000 irom bequests.
Because the money goes into the endowment, only the
income generated by the principal is spent.

This year, however, Staiiord foresees problems with
maintaining the current level of money obtained
through trusts and bequests because of high interest
rates and new tax legislation. Because people can
receive higher interest rates in financial ventures like
money market schemes, there is a disincentive to in-
vest in fixedrincome trust plans like the college‘s plan
which only generated seven and one-hair to eight per-
cent interest set in the guidelines by the trustees, Yet
besides a fixed-income trust plan, the college offers
people two variable income plans which have the
potential to give a higher return. Stafford said, “One
current variable income trust involves a pooled income
fund which currently yields 9.65 percent interest but
this rate will change over time,
