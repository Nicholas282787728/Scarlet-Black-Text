Constitution

continued tiom age 9
p

Supporters of the ERA point out that
although both the Iowa Constitution and
the United States Constitution
guarantee the laws will be applied
equally to all persons, the prohibition
against discrimination is not absolute
When laws creating . classifications
which differentiate among people are
challenged in court, one of two tests is
commonly used, Under the rational
basis tat, a classﬂication is upheld
unless it bears no rational relationship
to a legitimate state interest. The test is
lenient and its application usually
results in the upholding of the law, The
strict scrutiny test is applied when the
law involves a suspect classification
(such as race) or a fundamental
privilege (such as the right to vote).
Under this test, a classification is
upheld only it it is necessary to ac-
complish a compelling state interest.

Application usually results in finding
that a law is unconstitutional.

Gendersbased classifications have
never been found by Iowa or federal
courts to be suspect classifications. so
these classifications are usually upheld
by the courts. However, it should be
noted that the U S. Supreme Court has
struck down some gender-based
classifications by using a third test that
is midway between the rational basis
and strict scrutiny tests

The Iowa Constitution requires that
the question of having a constitutional
convention be submitted to voters
every 10 years. No provision is made
for the details of organizing a conven-
tion, The constitution only states that, if

a majority voting on the question vote
yes, the next legislature shall provide
for election of delegates to the conven-
tion and submission of the results of the
convention to the voters. Any resolur

tions passed by the convention would
have to be ratified by the voters before
they became amendments to the Iowa
Constitution.

The major proponent of a convention
is a group called Iowans for Tax Relief.
ITR would like to include an amend»
ment limiting the growth of govern-
ment revenue to a specified percentage
of the growth rate of Iowans’ total per-
sonal incomes,

Those opposed to a convention
generally ieel that a convention is not
needed, They feel that the Constitution
is operating well in its present him and
argue that the alternative method of
amending the constitution (approval of
an amendment by two consecutive
legislatures and ratiﬁcation by a ma-
jority of the voters) is adequate to pro-
vide any changes that are needed.
Many also point out that the cost oga
convention would be around $1 million.
They feel that this expense it too great
to be justified by the lew changes which
they feel are needed.

October 31, WHO"

Here are some oi the issues that each
candidate has highlighted in his
campaign material and what he had to
say about the subject:

Leach— '

on Government: “Government must
be compassionate, but it cannot do
everything for everybody. We must
establish a balanced federal budget and
get our economy moving again through
incentives to' get people to help
themselves, Good government. is less
government."

on Defense: “Aside from the outright
foreign policy ineptness, a root cause ol
our present diministed world leader-
ship role is the world's doubt of our
military capacity.

“To allay doubts, we have no choice
but to significantly upgrade our
military forces and improve our con-
ventional weapons capacities.

"An important part of that upgrading
is brlging miliary pay up to a level that
encourages people to enter the service
and make it a career."

’ On Social Security: “Difficult deci-
sions‘ will have to be made to ensure a
dignified retirement for all Americans.
There are no simple solutions, but a
responsible approach to shoring up the
Social Security System should include
measures to end abuses oi the present
system (such as payment of beneiis to

' imprisoned felonsl; use of revenues

lrom other sources such as the windlall
prolits tax on oil companies; and most

~important, bringing inflation under

control."
Larew—

On Energy: “We must summon our
national will to change the way we think
about energy and the way we use it. We
must look to alternative nonsnuclear
terms of energy production. We must

Jim [crew :

drive less wasteiully. insulate home's
and lactories, turn to solar technology,
and rebuild our railroads. We must con-
serve. Every barrel of oil Americans
conserved will reduce our dependence
or roreign powers,”

On Inﬂation: “Reduce inflation by
implementing iair and equitable
economic and interest rate programs,
programs which do not favor America‘s
wealthiest citizens, largest corpor-
taions, or banks over the needs of the
working people, the owners of small
business, and the family farmers of this
country." .

On Foreign Policy: “()eate a foreign
policy which calls for mutual reduction
in nuclear armaments by the world‘s
superpowers, for increased industrial
and agricultural trade between nations,
and for greater cooperation between
allied countries to deter aggression by
hostile forces." I
