Bad to the core

Well, they finally got it over with. The faculty finished
amending the infamous Parslow Proposal and voted over-
whelmingly against it at Monday’s meeting.

With this vote, we finally see an end to the push for core
curriculum on campus... at least for awhile. It is good to
see an end to this issue, which has been a source of con-
troversy at Grinnell for the past three years

The recent Admissions Department survey on the in-
fluence of Grinnell’s requirements on perspective
students and the general attitude of students toward the
issue (as represented by the ad-hoc committee survey and
the SGA’s actions) show it is obvious that the Parslow
Proposal is not only unpopular and unnecessary, but even
potentially harmful to the College!

Something important did actually occur at this week’s
faculty meeting. Let’s hope that this is the end of core curs
riculum at Grinnell not only for the time being, but for the
future generations of Grinnellians as well.

Bio theft
will hurt
students

To the Editor-

An almost unique ieature oi our
college is the opendoor policy
which attempts to provide a plea
sant and convenient environment
in which to work. In the science
building, rooms are lelt open at
night with almost unrestricted an
cess to space and equipment so
students can study or do lab work
during the more convenient even-
ing hours You would be surpriSr
ed, I think, at how many fine in
stitutions lock up all academic
buildings at dusk or earlier

One new iacihty (less than a
semester oldl provided by biology
is an audiovisual room designed to
allow students to review video
materials introduced in class at
times most suited to their busy
schedule, But no more,

Recently, probably some night.
the AV Cabinet was forced and the
color monitor and tape deck
taken. It's almost inconceivable
that, given the usual traffic in this
building, anyone could walk out
unobserved with that much bulky
equiment. th neither an observer
nor anyone who might have
discovered the missing equipment
later bothered to tell us. Maybe
they just didn't want to become
“involved."

A couple of years ago a bio ma-
jor told one of our staff, “I know
who has a department
microscope, but I won't tell you
where it is or who took it. I can't
rat on a fellow student.” Can you
believe it? when equipment is
stolen it isn‘t the faculty or college

administration who suffer, it is
you, the students.

This equipment (almost $1000
worth) was purchased ior your
beneﬁt. not. ours. and it was. of
course, paid for with your money
allocated ior education, not to sup-
port iaculty morale aild comlort.
In this instance we are not incline
ed to replace the stolen items
either. So. no more AV facility.
It’s a bloody shame,

P S. In spite of the damage done
to the TV cabinet, if the equip»
ment is returned in good condi-
tion, soon, no questions will be
asked Theft of this magnitude is
punishable by imprisonment and
we will push tor full prosecution.

Handgun
response

To the Editor:

As a member of Students for
Handgun Control, I would like to
respond to Ben Johnston's article
in the April 20th 5&8. Some of his
information was incomplete,

Mr Johnston stated,
“Switzerland and Israel have two
of the highest rates of firearm
ownership and yet their murder
rates are surprisingly low." what
he does not tell us is that handguns
are strictly regulated in these two
countries; the backgrounds of
potential buyers are checked
thoroughly, and the guns must be
registered and licensed.

in israel, a gun buyer is re-
quired to have a personal inter-
view, as well. The U.S. does not
require these precautions and

.sume Americans want even less

regulation; recently the NRA
pushed for a bill that would have
again made mailrorder gun purr
chasing legal.

Our organization is trying to
make it harder for people to buy
handguns because we believe it
will cut down on crime and ac-
cidents. Handguns comprise
about 30% of firearms in private
hands. but are responsible for
about 90% of firearms misuse, Ac»
cidents D0 happen. and far too
lrequently

Also, a large number oi the
murders in which a handgun is the
weapon occurs among family
members or friends who are
engaged in a dispute, It the guns
were not available, the killing
would not be so easily done: on
impulse, it is not difficult to pull a
trigger. And the Surgeon General
of tile U.S said. in 1979. “assaults
and suicide attempts are less like
ly to be iatal without flrearms.,."

Lastly. the Constitution does not
insure private ownership oi han-
dguns; it reads. “A well regulated
militia being necessary to the
security oi a tree state, the right
oi the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed." The
Supreme Court gave this amend-
ment a collective, militia inter-
pretation, and ruled in vs. vs.
Cruickshank that “, . . the bearing
oi arms tor a lawiul purpose . is
not a right granted by the Con-
stitution. . .”

Handgun Control. inc. is
presently looking ior volunteers to
form a Campus branch of Students
for Handgun Control, If you would
like more information please con
tact me. —— Karry Koon

Politics
referendum

To the Editor:

In the last Jomt Board meeting,
SGA overwhelmingly decided to
take the issue oi approval or Na-
tional/international political
resolutions to the students. in a
reterendum which will be held
May 4. trom 9 am. to 4:30 p.m. in
the Post oriice, students will have
the opportunity to vote on whether
or not resolutions on national and
international political issues shall
be decided in ARH 11. or by the
students themselves,

The resolution stipulates that

resolutions on national and inter
national political issues be ap-
proved hy the students in a refenr
dum. Under the present system,
SGA votes upon national and in
ternational political issues 7 and
represents the Grinnell student
body's opinion to the outside world
* as it alone sees fit. Without
direct sludent participation

Since SGA is elected to retire
sent students on their campus con
cerns. and not on the basis of a nar
tional and international political
platform. these areas should be
addressed directly by the
students.

In our opinion. this is a major
step forward SGA is elected for
student concerns on campus. yet
oi course there are also important
issues which concern us not only
as Grinnell students, but as
human beings as well. These
issues must be spoken out upon.
and this resolution will allow the
students to voice their opinion in a
truly democratic lashion

The resolution would not
hypothetical increase student
political acti ty on campus. and
allow SGA faithfully to represent
student opinions on national and
international politics to the out
side world. while still allowing
so». to represent student con
cerns on campus issues, We urge
Grinnell‘s students to get involv-
ed, talk to their hall represen-
tatives. and vote in the referen-

To the Editor:

We would like to clarify a few

to have been brought to campus

Deep-

seated
problems

By Heidi Brunibaugh

Do you remember that cute lit-
tle booklet you received during
New Student Days? I never read it
myselt, but i remember picking it
up once and glancing at a joke.
Two parents. well-dressed and in
their fifties, are in the dorms with
their young, fresh college student.
The woman whispers to her hus-
band, “Honey, did he say cored
bathrooms?” Ha, ha. Well, we're
mature. aren’t we? We’re liberal
enough‘ We can handle co—ed
bathrooms. After all, don’t the
stalls have doors?

of course, there are a few minor
problems to be resolved. For one
thing, this must be a democratic
process. This means that one per-
son on the floor can veto CD-ed
bathrooms (and cat hair, but
that's another issue). At the
beginning of the semester, a iloor
meeting is called and all the up
perclassmen loudly proclaim how
mature college students are, and
what an inconvenience “single-
sex" is, The vote is inevitably
vetoed. The Six. makes cute
signs, The upperclassmen loudly
speculate in the halls as to whom
the persecutor is. The SA. decides
that Dial-Adohn is just as good as
singlersex, He/She makes more
cute signs. Their use diminishes to
zero by the end oi two weeks. The
signs are torn down. Voila: cared
bathrooms.

But then, there are other varlar
tlons on the theme. One women’s
floor had “singlersex” all last
semester. but then decided that
since the men were using them
anyway they might as well
regulate the process, The SA.
made two cute signs. one
“Women" and one “Coed".
Beneath the cored sign was writ»
ten “But only it you put down the
seat ” To this someone promptly
responded, “Dirty, rotten, stink-
ing seat!" Get it?

Finding ambiguity in the S,A ‘5
request is understandable,
though, i mean, are the men sup-
pose to put down the seat beiore or
after they use the toilet? Pro-
blems would surely arise due to
variations on the whole idea.
Besides, what is the aversion the
ieminine sex has to putting down
the seat themselves? And while
we're on the subject why doesn’t
Grinnell supply a cover for the
seat — you know, one oi those
upholstered deals with matching
rugs? Then would the men have to
put that dowli as well'! Of course,
the problems at aim come up as
well, along with that other thing
which we won‘t even mention.

But somehow Grinnellians
manage to settle these disputes,
and I guess co-ed bathrooms are
just part of the all~too—ot'ten cited
“Grinnell Experience.” My
mother's pretty liberal. Her only
question was, “Where do the
women wash out their
underwear?"
——
believe his remarks fulfilled this
objective.

Furthermore, we object to the
use of the terms “proabortion”
and “prorlife” to describe the two
major viewpoints in question. No
one is “pro-abortion" or
antirlife”; the prorchoice position
is that every woman should have
the right and the necessary intorr
mation to term her own opinion, »
