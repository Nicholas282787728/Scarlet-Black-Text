Students Call for Gay Resource Center:
Tederman’s Proposal Draws Criticism

by John Harrison

On Tuesday, about 100 Grinnell College
students staged a rally at Fell House
demanding that the Dean of Student Af-
fairs, Jim Tederman, and the college ad-
ministration create a Gay Resource
Center on the college campus

standing in the nearrfreezmg rain, the
protesters sang songs and chanted tor
an hour until Tederman came outSide to
speak to the demonstrators.

The plans tor a Gay Resource Center
were presented to the college administra
tion in February after SGA publicly stated
that a Gay Resource Center was needed on
campus, The proposed center is to include
a library and other materials on homosex-
uality as well as meeting place for
students to gather and discuss issues cone
cerning their community In the proposal.
it is made clear that the gay resource
center is intended for the use of the entire
campus community. In recent months. a
number of acts of vandalism and anti-
homosexual graffiti have been seen on
campus and members of the gay com-
munity along with non-gays have called
for a campus-wide public education pro-
gram on homosexuality.

Tederman has said that the administrar
lion strongly agrees on the need for a gay
resource center. Yet the current con,
troversy has arisen over the creation ot a
human resource center that would house
the gay resource center along with a
resource center for women, blacks. and
minority groups. Tederman said. “We
agree gay students do have some very
special needs." But he added that the gay
community's needs would be better met
within the context of a human resource
center.

Tederman said that primarily iour
groups would use a gay resource center,

who are in the closet about their sexuality,
;hetrosexual students Seeking information,
students who are uncertain about their
sexuality, and gays who are open about
their sexuality," Tederman said in rela-
tion to these lour groups, “I believe most
of these students would not go to a gay
resource center." Tederman added, “We
don't want to set up an inettective pro-
gram.“

Tederman said that naming the center a
"human" resource center rather than
“gay” resource center would attract huth
homosexual and heterosexual students.
Tederman said, “We feel more students on

center if they didn't have the fear of being
stigmatized."

Yet many of the students protesting at
Fell House openly disagreed with Teder-
man‘s desire to place the gay resource
Center Within the conﬁnes of the hunlan
resource center.

Jim Fitzgerald. who had been talking
with the administration on the resource
center issue said, “By not using the name
“gay", die administration is diluting the
purpose of a gay resource center. Fits

stigma attached to the word “gay" and the

Babener '
and . Rupp

by Jill Ellis and John Harrison

Both the American Studies and the
Spanish Departments will he losing pro~
iessors next year as Lianha Babener in the
American studies department and
Stephen Rupp in the Spanish department
both plan to seek protessorship at other in
stitutinns.

Stephen Rupp, Assistant Professor at
Spanish, is resigning his position at Grins
hell and has accepted a job otter starting
next fall at the University of Toronto in On-
tario. Lianha Babener, Associate Pro-
fessor of American Studies and English is
resigning to accept a position as the head
of the English department at Montana
State University in Bozcman, Montana.

Rupp, who has been a member of the
Grinnell iaculty since tail of 1933, explains
that his reasons for leaving Grinnell are
threefold,

First, Rupp is originally irom Canada,
and is excited at the prospect of returning
to his home country. Toronto is a par-
ticularly wonderful and beautiful city in
which to live,

resource center is trying to overcome this
problem."

Angie Hugen. who also has been involv»
ed in the resource center negotiations, said
that with the gay resource center, the col-
lege “has shown its reluctance to make a
formal commitment to addressing the civil
and human rights of gays.” i-iugen said,
“The college's nondiscriminatory policy
means nothing without a commitment to
gays," Hugen said. “We want the college
to make a political statement saying its
okay to be gay."

Tederman defends the college's none
discriminatory policy by pointing out that
Gl'lnnell is one of the few colleges that
even has a non-discriminatory policy my
eluding sexual or allectional preference
Tederman said. “The college does enforce
its discrimination policy and is in the pro
cess if writing an harassment policy to
deal with all forms of sexual or racial
harassment.

As to the question of the placement of the
gay or human resource center, Tederman
originally proposed that the center be
housed in the forum. Yet Tederman said
that the space requested by the gay
students was too large for the forum and
the Health Center was suggested as an
alternative.

in a flier circulated on campus this
week. the gay community contended that
to put the gay resource center in the
Health Center “is to equate it with
illness!" Tederman said, “It is not my in
tention to equate homosexuality with il-
lness and I believe this accusation is
nothing but a cheap shot.”

Currently, there has been the suggestion
to put the gay resource center in Fell
House when student affairs offices move to
the iorum next year. Yet as oi now the
debate over the naming of the resource
center remains undecided. Jim Tederman,
representatives from the gay community,
and President Drake are scheduled to
meet Friday afternoon to discuss the issue
further.

Resign

Secondly, for a single man such as Rupp,
living in Grinnell is “a little difficult"
when it comes to establishing and mains
taining an active social life. In Toronto,
Rupp can enjoy all the culture a major city
has to offer.

Rupp’s third reason for leaving Grinnell
is his preierence for working at a large
university institution rather than a small
liberal arts college. Although Rupp
believes that “the students at Grinnell are
good," he wants to work more with
graduate students, with whom he can pure
sue more research in his specific field of
interest. ‘

In general, hupp says, “a university is
more academically stimulating” than a
small college. Rupp spent his
undergraduate days at a large university,
and looks forward to returning to a big
university where greater emphasis is plac-
ed on research. '

Babener, a tenured professor who has
been at Grinnell for nine year said the
reason she was leaving was because Mon-
tana State provides a “wonderful profes-
