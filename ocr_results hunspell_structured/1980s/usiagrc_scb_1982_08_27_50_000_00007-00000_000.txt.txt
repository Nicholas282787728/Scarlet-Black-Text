Athletic recruiting at Grinnell low-key operation
Despi‘ie simplicity, controversy and doubtL surround soft-sell program

by Jeff Raymond

There are people at Grinnell who ques-
tion the validity or this school trying to
recruit freshman talent for the athletic
teams. They claim that Grinnell is not and
should never be a ”jock school." They also
are concerned because they don‘t like to
see financial aid money spent to bring in
studentsathletes when money is so tight for
all students.

Quite a tew other people, however, are
confident of the necessity of the recruiting
procedure, Grinnell Head Football Coach
Ed Dnmbrowski, whose recruiting eiioris
this year produced 11 new players [or his
team, stated that, “The freshmen main
tain the program."

The recruiting program at Grinnell is a
low-key, non-pressured approach that is
vastly dirierent trom the hoopla that is
associated with major conference athletic
programs Because oi Midwest Collegiate
Athletic Conference rules Grinnell coaches
are not allowed to visit high schools to
solicit their program to the student-
athletes. Instead. phone calls and letters to
potential Grinnellians and some visits to
high school coaches and tournaments are
the only means that Grinnell coaches have

.to attract new players,

The athletic department, headed by
Athletic Director John Pfitsch, receives
$3,500 to spend on calls and letters to
recruits. All other expenses must by paid
by the indiVidunl coach. so long trips to
games and tournaments are rare.

Piitsch said the money that the depart
ment gets irom the college is “pretty good
for what we can do.” The money must be
divided so that all the coaches are able to
contact students, but nobody has a set
amount they can use ior their own pur»
poses.

Because of the sheer numbers involved
in putting enough people logemer tor a
football team as well as the ﬁnancial aid
squeeze, Pfitsch feels that Dombrowski
may have the toughest job when it comes
to bringing in new people. This year's total
of 11 new gridders is the lowest in several
years, though Dombrowski said he, wasn't
dlsappointed by the team’s smaller size,

While some iniorination on prospects
can come directly irom coaches or aiur
most oit eads that Domhrowski and
other co cs gcl comcs train the ad;
sions other alter a student has loci on 'dps
piication to attend Grinnell, nonibrowski
takcs advantage or a student's academic

interests to plug Grinnell to potential
student-athletes, He feels that ii a student
is willing to keep academics tirst and use
athletics as a secondary interest then he
has as good a chance as anyone to cons
vince a prospect to choose Grinnell,

Since most of Grinnell's recruits come
here [or the academics, a coach will rarely
iind one or more truly giited athletes in a
group of recruits in fact, since coaches
can't visit the athletes personally unless
they are on campus tor a visit, most iii-
coming recruits are unknown entities.

Sometimes iilmed action oi a player or
word-amouth reaches a coach at Grins
nell, hilt John Harvey. men’s basketball
and women's tennis coach, makes the
point that by that time other schools know
about that person's abilities and convince
them to exploit their athletic talents at the
other school Thus, the exceptional player
at Grinnell is a rarity.

Grinnell is not totally outgunned as far
as personnel, though, in conierence coma
petition. Since league rules restrict all of
the coaches in recruiting practices,
nobody has any big advantage over
another.

plusch pointed out that some schools in
the league are hurting tor applicans and
are relying more on student-athletes to fill
their roles, while Grinnell generally ends

Recruiting. iispnuolly on a big-time

arcn governed by the National Collegiate

Athletic Association, The recruiting
regulations for Division lll schools aren't
as stringent as MCAC rules. ironically,
there is no investigative or policing power
in the conlcrence so any infractions by
member schools are discovered primarily
through in-house investigations.

The coniere e policy on recruiting is
straightiorivar : “In summary. it lS a
principle of the MCAC that recruitment or
studentathletes is a specific runction of
the Admissions Departments. athletic
stall members must coniine their recruit»
ment activities to their college campuses.
No person may be employed in a combina-
tion at admissions, iinaiicial aid and
coaching responsibilities.”

Athletic scholarships are illegal in Divi-
sion in schools. according to NCAA
guidelines. There are suspicions. though,
that schools could alter normal iinanciai
aid packages to make them more attrac»
live to studentrathletes, while Grinnell is
in an economic situation that allows it to
give all the tinancial aid that a person
needs, it would be breaking NCA regula
tions it it gave any more money than a

studentathlete truly needed.

NCAA rules for Division 111 schools state
that: “The assistance offered each year

,may not exceed financial need as deter-

mined by any need analysis system which
contorms to the Uniiorm Methodology
calculations and is approved by the United
States Department of Education.“
Academic scholarships may be awarded.
though, as long as they are made in-
dependently oi athletic interest and are
consistent With other such awards.

Pfitsch indicated that other small
school~ including several in the MCAC,

Poi-naps with some irony, a piing oi
four or this year‘s l'ooihali recruits down
played the eiloris ol‘ Donibl'owski to
recruitthem as being a inctor in their deci-
sions to enroll at Grinnell.

Freshman Robert Quashie was cons
(acted twice by Dombrowski but also had
otters from several Missouri Valley Conn

'ierence schools as well as Kansas State.

He chose Grinnell because he wanted a
good place to study. Quashie said that he
was not disturbed by the high~pressure
programs oi the bigger schools but felt
that football was secondary to his studies,

Both new students Charles Blomquist
and David Dorsey were contacled oiten by
Dombrowski and had otters from several
other schools as well. They said that the
pressure that the other schools put on them
turned them‘vfiand found the academic

reputation oi Grinnell more to their liking.
Dorsey, who was recruited by the Divison I
University of Cincinnati, enrolled here
because he didn't want his college career
to revolve around athletics.

Steve Worth, a freshman prospect at

,quarterback, had originally been con-

tactedv by Baseball Coach John Martinek
but later decided to try out for the football
team because he had always participated
in the sport, He maintained that although
athletics had always been important to
him. he came to Grinnell for the
academics and wasn't really iniluenced by
any reciuiting calls.

The freshmen were disturbed by what
they perceived to be a strong antijock senr
timent at Grinnell and by the discrimina»
tion initiated against them when the word
got out they were iootbali players. They
regretted the sudden ioss of support they
ielt ailer going lrom high school to a col-
lege program in winch they were instantly
put on the deiensive.

Blomqulst pointed out that because oi
lootball they will have more academic
pressure than others. He said that some or
the run was taken from the game because
or me attitude that some people have
towards them as ioothall players. Dorsey,
in a moment or inspired exuberance, smil»
ed and said, “I guess we'll just have to
change that altitude oi their’s."
