anymore except the new York Times. Big
deal, anybody can copy the Times, let's
see them try to be original.

The paper itseli is much bigger than the
“old” Register, but don't be fooled, The
Des Moines Tribune (which was an even
ing Des Moines paper owned by the same
folks) closed last Saturday, so all they've
really done is incorporate much of the
features from the Tribune with the
Register. Now, the Register is about twice
as big as before, but the catch is that it’s
all fluff, nothing but worthless ﬂuff.

My favorite change is page two and
three of the first section. The old Register
had international news on page two, they
called it the “World Report," and page
three was local news. In the new and im-
proved Register page two is weather and
page ﬁbres is a section called “People in
the News." Each of these new sections is
incredibly extensive and incredibly boring
and why they put it in such a prominent
place I'll never know. I think they have
moved the international news to page six
or seven of the first section, butI've usual-
ly fallen asleep by then so 1 can't say ior
sure,

There are some nice aspects to the new
Register. There are more cartoons, in
cluding “Garfield” (for those who like to
read about obese, slothrlike felines), and
you no longer have to hunt for
”Doonesbury” 7 it‘s in the same place
everyday. And, of course, Donald Kaul is
still in his old spot — warning new readers
or his column Monday that they are “ex-
pected to be alert,”

But, for me, there is one new feature that
I can’t believe we’ve lived without for so
long. They have a new section they're call~
ing “Almanac” and in it is a complete list
of obituaries, births and deaths, marriages
and divorces and alarms. I ask you, how
have we been able to survive without
knowing what all the fire and rescue calls
were during the last 24 hours? Example:
“4:16 p.111. A 1507 E. Court Ave., minor
fire.” Wow, I {eel much better.

There‘s more to tell, but I don’t think
that I should go any further because the
Fred MacMui-ray reeling in my stomach is
becoming more intense.

and Food Service knows it, is that the peo-
ple walking through the line would pro-

The timing of their semi-decent meals
and their slop days is also quite amazing.
During finals, when you would think that
we could use a break, all we get for the
week is the semester‘s leftovers which are
baked and burned into casseroles, loaves
and goulashes. No one ate the originals for
a reason. We've been inundated with liver

have a wonderful Oktoberfest meal (if we

Beware the fOOd service menace

Yesterday, but it could have been any
day, I walked into Quad. When I walked in,
I expected to be served (now get this) food,
Hahl I might just as well have Walked into
a sludge factory. Instead of a nutritional,
tasty meal, I was served Swill. The first
thing that caught my eyes was the
potatoes, split open with ground meat in-
side, Well, since nearly all of us saw the
hideous spectacle, I need not go into the
gruesome resemblance of the chunky
meat to certain bodily excretions,

I suppose the kitchen staffs think that
they are fooling us somehow. I can just see
the food service chairman, rubbing his
hands together as he laughingly tells his
cronies who sit in his office how they will
burn the food, toxify the lettuce, overboil
the vegetables and generally add to at
least this student’s misery. He screamed,
smashinghisfist to the table, hiseyes glar-
ing at the combined staffs, “We must
demoralize the students ! ”

It all must have begun with the plants.
Somewhere, in the dark regions of his
mind, the chairman must have finally
reached what he considered the ultimate
plan, he would plant verdant leaves
throughout Cowles and men, with the
school’s money, get his jollies watching
the leaves wither. Oh, what rapture! To
watch vegetation decay! But what would
he cause to decay next? Why, the food, of
course! He probably sat up in bed,
bursting into hysterics. ”The food, that’s
it? " He may have giggled maniacally, his
wife staring at him with fear in her eyes.
What kind of man had she married?

It was a warm day (the kind of day food
spoils, thought the Sultan of Sludge) when
the expert wxologists appeared in the food
service chairman's office. ”Gentlemen,"
perhaps he said, “this is a list of what we
should be eating," simultaneously handing
them mimeographed sheets. “How can we
ruin it?” The experts rubbed their chins.
They poured over the list. Finally, after a
few hours, they returned a list of ruinous
tips for cooking the food. “Ah ha ha,"
laughed the Kaiser of Swill, his gruff laugh
cowering the poison-minded men, sweat
rolling down his tace like grease off a fry-
ing pan.

And so, students, now you know what
could be going on behind closed doors, in
the steam-filled rooms behind Hie kitchen.
But wait! Now that the plants are wither-
ing. now that the food is in decay, who will
be next? What certain group within the
coniines of this 93 acre campus is most
directly threatened by the food Service

Joe ' Neri

parents who are reading this paper will not
think that what you are getting this
weekend is indicative of the average meal
here.

So what can we do about it? Well, we can
write little comments on the meal slips,
but do you think that these comments have
helped in the past? It’s time we had a
revolt! Any suggestions? There must be
something that we can do! ‘

Letters

From Nollen
and Burling

To the Editor:

This week students painted the new
stone lacade of Burling Library. We are
extremely disturbed by this self-indulgent
behavior. The stone may have been per-
manently defaced even before the building
has been completed.

The college has worked hard to produce
an excellent library for its students. Yet, it
has been vandalized almost from the mo
ment that it was reopened. Besides the
painting incident, the oak trim on several
carrels has been marked by pencils and
pens and the walls have been marked.

Gnnnell does its best to provide an ap-
propriate and attractive environment for
its students and it is hard to understand
why some wish to damage it. We are deter-
mined to protect die attractiveness of the
campus. and we are especially concerned
about Burling Library. Therefore, it
should be understh that those, whether
students or others, who deface the library
and other campus buildings will be subject
tu appropriate disciplinary action. —
George A. Drake, pruident; Waldo W.
Walker, executive vice president; James
S. Tederman, vice president and dean of
Student Affairs; Christopher McKee,
librarian of the college.

Reply to Clayton

To the Editor:

I cannot believe the letter mat Lee Ann
Clayton wrote last week. Am I right in as
suming that her only purpose is to inform
us of her disagreement with Lynn Cutler?
Well I am sure that many people at Grin—
nell do not agree with Lynn Cutler, yet
they have not wasted space in the 5&3 to
share this earth shattering fact with us.
But as long as Ms. Clayton has homered to
attract our attention, I would like to give a
reply.

I would be very surprised if Lynn Cutler
did not speak of Cooper Evans in a
negative light. Obviously she is a
Democrat, and it is to her advantage to
support her party and to criticize the
Republicans. In light at the economic pro»
blems we are now facing, it Certainly
makes sense for her to defend the policies
of the Carter Administration. If Carter's
pruidency was a failure, why is inflation
and unemployment much worse now than
during his tenure? President Reagan has
had more than enough time to test his ob—
solete economic meories He is the pro—
blem, not the cure. Cooper Evans and his
New Right cronies are not helping the
situation by turning Congress into a rubber
stamp.

The “big spending policies and big

I David Kopelman

as they burn the student comments How
long before these aproned poisoners put
me final plan, kichenated centralism, into
operation7 How long belore the finely tune
ed kitchen staff takes over a demoralized
student body? why, justlast week we were
told we could not have seconds on pizza as
it was ‘running out,’ and then those same
pizzas were served lor supper! students
unltel You have nothing to lose but your
pains! (Stomach pains that is.)

so casually accused Jimmy Carter of were
actually created under the Nixon Ad—
ministration. Everybody knows that there
has been and still is a scandalous amount
of waste in the federal government. Can
President Reagan‘s policy of cutting pro
grams indiscriminawa and giving the
military establishment a blank check do
anything but worsen the situation?

It takes gall to tell us that the voters
“repudiated" Jimmy Carter in 1980. Less
than 50 percent of the eligible voters even
bothered to show up. Special interest
groups and big business had their revenge
in 1980,

If last week‘s letter is any indication of
the way in which the Grinnell College
Republicans present their arguments, the
organization must be in much worse shape
than any of us could have imagined. —
Sincerely, Steve Kaganove

eighteenth
century theme

Doctor, Doctor,
Please, please,

Help me end this pain;

When i went to Sunday school,

The bible burned in flames.

Doctor, Doctor, 0h, Doctor,

Now I iorget the names

Burned by potent Catholic fuel.
Charred and burned and bloody crossﬁ
Cramped my healthy disposition,

Left the crimes of my position

which my loving conscience tossa.

All the days, their haze. their ways,
Sucked me in, stretched my fever,
Snapped, i stunned, took up the cleaver
Full incensed, I vowed to end my daze
And cleft the word, the sense to save.

By John Walter and Guy Pierson
