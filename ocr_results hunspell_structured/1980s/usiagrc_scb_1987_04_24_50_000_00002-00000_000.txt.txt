College bans

campus

tobacco sales

by Dave Jones .

“Havmg 2i policy against smoking and
making a proﬁt on cigarettes is kind ot a
contradiction. ‘ said college VICE'pl'eSIdellt
Waldo Walker as justification tor the ad-
ministration‘s banning of cigarette and
tobacco sales in the campus bookstore
The move was part ot a smoking policy
decided by the pi-csident'sstaii that also
bans Smoking Ill all administrative offices
and public areas in iaculty buildings

Banning cigarette sales in the bookstore.

the only place on campus where they were
sold. has stirred discussion among the col
lege community --li.tbe whole country
says you can sell cigarettesrand its legal
in the country. then I don't see w
have to be making it illegal here.
SGA president Ali ElSal’iar Elsati'ar and
SGA vicespresident Shannon McDonald
have indicated that SGA will conduct LI stu-
dent initiative on the smoking policy to
determine what campus opinion is on the
subject. ‘

Although smoking will no longer be per

mittcd in administrative oiiices and public
areas in iaculty buildings. the administra-
tion made no policy lor the remainder oi
the campus ”I did not teel. nor did the
president's stall. that it was appropriate
tor us to unilaterally decide tor the college
campus what the policy should be that tip
plies to the entire campus.” said Walker
Hc teels. howciei'. that the policy enacted
carries with it an ~~implied invitation" for
the students and taculty to consider the
situation

ElSaliar sees the implications oi this
policy as being contradictory to the ads
ministratioii‘s position on future smoking
regulations. - The cont-idiotioii. It seems
to me. is he tivalkei-i said that he wants
students and iaculty to decide on their
own. their own regulations about smoking,
And yet it seems like they’re making
regulations about students and faculty by
denying sales in the bookstore," Elsal‘far
said

ween the nationalism of Nazi Germany
and contemporary American nationalism?

Mitlord:

Well, I don't know. I think that there are
parallels, It's dangerous always, to make
those parallels too close, To me the super
threat, obviously, is the ioreign policy; and
the possibility at war in this hemisphere
against Nicaragua. That’s the thing that is
scary, And everything you read points to
that, so that is why Contragate is such a
breath of fresh air, because it may have
stopped that in its tracks. A lot has happens
ed. For example, Edwin Mees'e has been
stopped in his tracks, too, because or his
role in the Contragate. The fact that for
live key days Edwin Meese didn't do
anything about getting the FBI into the in-
vestigation of Ollie North 7 I love that
name, Ollie. Anyhow, dear otlie got away
with sort oi shredding everything, And oi
course an even nicer name is his
secretary, what’s her name? Fawn...Fawn
Dawn. or something....and these people
are in high places.

Scarlet and Black:
But it seems that Reagan's image has
rebounded from this incident,

Milford:

Yes, constantly I don't know how this
happens. It‘s so amazing that when you
read the polls, something like fiftysfive

seventy [percent] don't believe him, and
yet the same percentage like him, and ad»
mire him

Scarlet anti Black:
Do you think that people have come not
to expect truth‘frpm' their leaders,

Milford:
That could be part. at it, I don’t know.

Scarlet and lilack:
What are your ieelings about feminism?

1976, And I'm very much for it [feminism].
But I‘d like to have something more
speciiic.

Scarlet and Black:
what do you think about the turnings oi

Millard:

Well, I’m all for Women in business or in

manifestations of feminism that I find

Scarlet and Black:

It seems that saying “authorcss” or "ac-
