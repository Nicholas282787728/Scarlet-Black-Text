Part VI “of

The Tales of
Tris and Ella

As narrated by James Embryo

Rubble. Bits of [lying rubble. Chunks of
rock, some larger than others, all with
velocity vectors pointing in the most
ominous directions.

That's what you. constipated reader,
would have seen had you been one of our
favorite sheep that fateful day, that day to
live long in history's annals, thatday dubb-
ed (by the same unborn poet mentioned
earlier in these pages, whose name we
scholars and journeymen lisp with the utr
most fondness and reverence) “The Day
the Library Exploded."

A ﬂash of light. You would have seen
that, had you been one at our favorite (ale
they really?) sheep, had you tilted your
head (snout? protuberance?) along the ape
propriate line of sight. Miscroseconds
before the explosion (referred to by some
disreputable people as “The Little Bang”)
01' the library, a low dose of high~intensity
electromagnetic radiation would have ims
posed itseli upon your cornea, to be follow—
ed (as physicists have since attested) by
bits of (lying rubble,

Whatever would you have done?

i (the author, speaking briefly as
myself) hear in die interior recesses of my
head, back far in the cerebral cortex

where only groundhogs live at dusk, 1 hear
a chorus, a swelling chorus, almosta chan-
ting...i hear, it with increasing clarity
every minute-may, every second- every
nanosecond-"the following response: “I
would have gotten the hell out of there.”

But this (speaking once more as a
dispassionate narrator) is a simplistic
response, too simple for any description of
what our Wairn woolly Warblers actually
did. what did they do? They acted: with
boldness beyond belief, with haste beyond
measurement, with courage beyond
hravery...But words fail. Once again, we
rely upon the poet’s clearsweet voice:

What Tris and Ella really did'.’

Behind F137 they hid.

o, glorious Nenturnian, pierced by
chunks ol ilying rubble! 0 baaing sheep,
pierced to the core with trepidation! What
can be done now'! Can F137 be saved?
What about his balloon? What about the
librarian, whose yes still flash
polychromatically in our unworthy minds?
What about the author, whose voice has
tinctured the narrative with its almost
unbearable eloquence? What about Part
VII of the final period. ,
