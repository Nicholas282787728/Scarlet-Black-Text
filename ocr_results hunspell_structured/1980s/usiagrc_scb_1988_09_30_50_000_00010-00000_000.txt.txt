had t-shirts printed up saying,
"Charlie's Angels". Cute. huh?
Maybe we should get some
printed up with “Dee's Darlings".
Just a suggestion.

On Saturday morning Lake
Forest came to visit. Grinnell
played extremely well, but came
up one match short. Heather
Radach, number one, and Jennie
Wang. number six, won their
singles matches and once again
the doubles matches would decide
the match. Radach and Smith
lost their first set 06 but came
back to overpower Lake Forest's
number one doubles team 6-0, 6-
0 in the second and third sets.
Wang and Banfield remained unA
defeated, but the doubles team of
Apryl Henry and Lisa Jepscn lost
a long. tough match.

Overall. however. the team
did very well. holding their own
against two of the top teams in
conference. Come cheer as Grin-
nell meets Upper Iowa on Satur»
day at 11 AM. on the IOIh AV~
enue Courts.

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom

On Wednesday. Oct. 5, at 8
pm. in Roberts Theatre, Ma
Rainey’r Black Bottom will be
staged by Arnaryllis Productions.
The drama, a probing look into
the world of black musicians in
the 19205, was voted Best Play
of the Year by the New York
Drama CritiCS' Circle for the
1984-85 season and nominated
for several Tony Awards.

Ma Rainey is the work of
Tony Award-winning playwright
August Wilson (Fences). Set
within the backdrop of a Chicago
recording studio. the play cele-
brates the legacy of Gertrude
"Ma" Raincy, who many consider
Mother of the Blues. However.

the play also examines the larger

issues of oppression and racism
as they were reﬂected in the world
of black musicians in the 1920s.
According to the director, Ken
Nixon, "it is a bluesadrama which
focuses in on the brutal impact of
racism, oppression, and self-hate
on the spirit, and allows us to see
the atmosphere out of which the
civil rights movement, almost 40
years later, was to evolve."

Tickets for reserved seating
are available free of charge at the
Forum desk. Ticket distribution
began Thursday. September 29,
and will continue each day. slan—
ing at 11 a.m.. until the evening
of the performance. Seats will be

alumni to teach in China's
schools and universities. The
program enjoyed great success
until wanime conditions forced it
to end in 1937.

In 1985, Grinnell reestabr
lished direct conlacts with Nan-
jittg University in the People‘s
Republic of China. The two in-
stitutions also began this aca-
demic year sharing a faculty exv
change program in which Grin-
nell invites one faculty member
from Nanjing University to teach
each year in Grinnell.

Director of Chinese Studies.
Andrew Hsich, feels the exchange
program will continue to remain
strong because it is well on»
dowed, and has been very
successful thus far.
