“an ability to select emerging artists
who will gain enormous tuture

sightedness that is especially needed
in booking uprandrcoming women ar-
tists.

It's not that Grinnell has never
brought in women pertormers It has:
Grace Slick in rock, Big Mama Thorns
ton and Koko Taylor in blues, Betty
Carter and Nina Simone in jazz,
Maybelle Carter, Odetta, and Buity St.
Marie in Iolk. And in the last two or
three years, the Concert Committees
have tried but [ailed (because of high
prices, availability, aborted tours, or
various logistical problems) to bring
Bonnie Koluc, Laura Nyro, Bonnie
Raitt, Patti Smith, Rachel Sweet, and
Wendy Waldman. It's unfortunate that
these concerts haven't panned out, but
it’s all the more reason to keep trying.
