EM. Outta Ice:
“18 ISSIIBS on
OIIIGI‘ camnuses

Although most dorm floors and houses in Grinnell receive the news on
the international, national, state and local levels from the Des Moines
Register, Grinnell Herald-Register and the SM}, it‘s easy to forget that
there are other schools out there and that they are affected by many of
the same issues we are. It’s even easier to forget that there are topics on
other campuses which have no similarity to those here.

In this issue, the 58:13 is highlighting the concerns of these schools as
expressed in the editorials of their newspapers, with which we exchange
copies.

From the Talon of Oklahoma Christian College; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma:

Although the presence of an antirERA organization on campus during Lectureships
does not demand the conclusion that our college or the Church of Christ officially endorses
their views, the problem raised in our conversation is a valid one. The issue would pro-
bably not exist in this student’s mind nor in the minds of several others with whom l talked
on campus if it were not for the amorphous but unquestionable consensus which seems to
have formed within the church in opposition to ERA.

Although no council of cardinals has laid down our official position on the amendment,
the active campaigning by large numbers of Church of Christ members in anti-ERA

groups coupled with the use of church lobbies and church functions to encourage support
for their cause is in danger or becoming the Restorationist equivalent of ex cathedra to

some.
From the Stoutonian of the University of Wisconsin-Stout: Menomenie,

Wisconsin:

“Liddy is a pro; he is also a con man and a convicted criminal. He is no doubt a very in-
telligent man but don't let that intelligence fool you. He is a dangerous man.

The captivated capacity crowd in the lieldhouse seemed to lose all track of time in less
than two hours, With each passing minute he minimized or erased the crimes committed

just 10 years ago.
what was forgotten in that time span was Watergate and the deception of the American

people and the crimes perpetrated by Liddy."
From Mac Weekly of Macalester College; St. Paul, Minnesota:

“The real tragedy of Egyptian President Anwar Sada's assasination may be that
Richard Nixon was allowed to be respected,

As you may recall, Nixon was called upon to be a personal envoy of Ronald Reagan at
Sadat's funeral. in an historic occassion, three eprresidents were gathered together with
a current president, and then three excpresidents boarded a plane and discussed the trials
of being president. And the nation smiled."

From the Ray of Central College; Pella, Iowa: ’

“One may not think of Central College as being the kind of place where students can find

danger and excitement every day but, as many people have found out, the walk to their

classes is ﬁlled with such adventure.
The main question lurking in the back of everyone’s mind is, “Will I {all on the ice again

today and make a fool of myself?’ "
From the Catalyst of Colorado College; Colorado Springs, Colorado:

“President Reagan seems fixed on a policy of hostility toward Cuba. Yet such can only
prove counterproductive to our goal with that estranged neighbor.

In large part, die administration wants to minimize Cuba's influence in the Third World
and thus render its revolutionary efforts ineffective. But the Reaganrl-laig rhetor' al
assault upon that island protends a policy which will accomplish exactly the opposite

As a last note, we’re including the viewpoint of the FYI oi Grinnell Com-
munity Senior High School:

“Rah! Rah! Rah! School spirit is sadly lacking this year and those Rah’s have become
blah's. Not that i care but itseems to be the subject of therest of this paper, so i decided to
write about it. -

The first possible problem is the cheerleaders: they aren't overly enthusiastic and they
just don’t yell loud enough. i can barely hear them over Alex Liberman and Mike Ramsey
who usually sit 15 rows behind me, Maybe he and a few others who have the same type of
ﬂverpowering voices should turn from screaming their heads off and occasionally heckl-
ing the referees and become cheerleaders. But when i turn around to tell them so, i see
they are the only people in the stands."

see so many students gathered to construc-

everyone happy The two major CrlSlCISm

rallies existed before the reference 01 our

that any group 01'on expressing a desire
for change will always look the way groups
looked in the ‘605. before the '605 and on

we felt and our petitions seemed to have

talked to the trustees at length and it was

To the Editor:

i recall being enticed to Grinnell College
by a certain idea] this institution once
upheld- to learn how to ask questions.
Because in order to find the right answers.
one must first ask the right questions

In the three years I have attended Gl'lnr
nell, Dan Magurshak is undoubtedly the
finest professor I have encountered. As a
lecturer. he enables the student to com-
prehend the diificult philosophical
readings and concepts through lucid, con-
cise and organized presentations. But
where Dan really excels is in his aim for
the student to develop his own process of
philosophical inquest Thus; beyond
teaching what the philosophers have
pondered, Dan teaches the student how to
ponder When 1 completed each or my two
semesters of a Magurshak philosophy
course, I walked away with more than a
knowledge of philosophy. I walked away
with an experience of philosophy, and a far
greater ability to think, to question,

or Dan's integrity and sincere compas-
sion for others. i cannot justly com.
municate in writing. fnstead of relaying a
personal example, let me just say that I
have never met a finer human being I do
not make this statement lightly

I need not mention my emotions over
Dan‘s denial of tenure. I will only ask one
question: if Dan Magurshak has been
overwhelmingly praised as an outstanding
professor by the students, strongly recomr
mended tor tenure by the Philosophy EPC.
recommended for tenure by the chairman
of his department (who until now has not
recommended anyone for tenure in the
past 14 yearsl and has unanimously been
recommended for tenure by the social
studies division, then why did George
Drake inform Dan Magurshak that he is
not of high enough caliber to become
tenured at this institution?

AS the evidence demonstrates, Dan une»
quivocally measures up to the ideals of a
professor. whatever the personal or

Group fSASGl has been educating the
campus about the situation in South Africa
for more than a year and Roger Gurira‘s
opening statement helped inform any lg»
norant protestors. As {or commim-fent it is
true that zoo people do not come to our
weekly meetings but if we expected every
supporter to come to every meeting we
would also havc to envision must of the
other campus groups folding because their
members were too busy, A demonstration
is a good way to let people make their sup—
port count without spending too 'much of
their scarce time. ‘ “ ’

So much for the good side of the divest
ment issue at Grinnell The trustees have
somehow managed to talk for over one
year only to revert to a lm decision that
has proven useless and that helped to
create the situation that caused the SASG
to raise the issue in the first place.’ it is
said that the board will consider "well
documented proposals" but if the SASG
hasn‘t shown them a well documented pro-
posal i don't know what one is. in several
conferences with the board or, parts of it.
by trying to show the trustees films and by
sending them information we have shown
them that divestment is the‘jus‘t‘ ‘rout'e that
will not hurt the college. Although the
question is a moral one we have taken
pains to refute their practical arguments

political reasons for his denial of tenure
may be, and i make this statement not as
an accusation, but as a logical deduction. it
is clear that the primary reason for the ex-
istence of this institution is not being serv-
ed by oils decision. I cannot emphasize it
enough that before an answer be decided.
the right questions first be asked a

To the Editor“

it was ironical that an editorial in last
Week‘s son complained about an "infor-
mation gap" between the paper and the
administration while, in a front-page artir
Cle, Ellen Heath mlsquoted Helen Weise:

. Helen Weise said the Board will not
rclc se an official statement concerning
discussions on South Africa divestment
The trustees <sicl talks will, however. be
disclosed to the Grinnell Magazine.

Ms, Weise tells me that what she actual
ly said was that something about the deci-
sion will appear in the magazine. No
trustee has “disclosed" anything to me.

This isn't the first time that a reporter
has misquoted a source on the front page
of the 5&3. why, then, do the editors ex-
pect the fullest cooperation from ad-
ministrators (and others) who cannot be
sure that their statements will be ac-
curately reported” 7 Sincerely, Linda A
Rabben, Editor. The (lrililiell Magazine

The Editor responds.

The responsibility for any possible min
up of information between the sell; and
Weise must be taken by myself, because i
was the staff member who spoke with her. i
However, I believe our reporting was
sound. what we were noting was the lack ’
of information being released to students. ,
or, specifically. to members of the South
African Support Group.

As you must know, details of trustees'
meetings are not usually "disclosed" by ‘
