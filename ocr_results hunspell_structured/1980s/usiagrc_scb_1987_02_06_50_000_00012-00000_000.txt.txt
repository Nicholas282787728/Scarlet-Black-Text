”Warden’s Corning." Photo by ‘John Pozar.

Anyone who is interested in publishing a black-and-white photo in
this space should send the photo to box 6-51 one week before publica-

opportunity to publish photography that is not necessarily related to
any campus event. — Stephen Hardwick, PhotograLhy editor.

warm atmosphere and sense of scholarly
fellowship which seem to radiate from the
Forum Grill like an overpowering, yet
somehow appealing. odor.

i imagine mysell, scarf wound about my
neck, a lew leather-bound books under my
arm (but not so many as to appear
cumbersome), perhaps a lew days growth
of goatee clouding my chin, a long,
gracelul cigarette dangling from my hand
like a slender sixth linger, trailing its
gossamer white ribbon ol smoke into the
air behind it as l glide up to the counter
and say, “I'll have a medium coffee and a
bagel.” ormimme a cup of joe.” or even,
“How ‘bout the regular, Rosie?"

Then, after receiving my tantalizing
wares, i would select a comrortable spot
and seat my delicate rear, preparing
mysell lor the ensuing period of casual
verbal exchange, addressing such diverse
topics as the writings of Friedrich Nietzs
sche, the state of international affairs, and
the Super Bowl. I would raise my cigarette

roundings. occasronally pausing between
polls to take a thoughtful sip ol my freshly
brewed cup of coffee, and occasionally
pausing between sips and pulls in add my
opinions to the argument which is politely
raging among my companions. saying
such things as, “I believe Socrates was in-
deed a pre—Christian martyr {or the cause
ol philosophy," or, “Despite Hemingway's
unquestionable sexual bias. I consider him
to be a master ol clear, tightly controlled
prose”, or perhaps, “Did you read that
new list in the Hurling john?"

second or third hour has passed and the
filth and sixth cups of bubbling Caffeinated
beverage have been drained. and people
begin to depart, called away by other
pressing duties, such as playing pool, wat-

would lean back in my chair, put out the‘
remains of my last cigarette, release a
contented, coffee—flavored yawn and
declare, "Yep, it don't get much better
than this."

no, Soviet citizens have smaller apart
ments and lower things. and what they do
have is nltcn of a lower quality than would
be found in the United States. However.
the Communist party tells Soviets that
"material wealth is not important." and
most Soviets are lorceol into believing it

One possible reason for the differences
in the standard of living was suggested by
Peggy. “Because the economic system in
the Soviet Union is socialisl. and the
government subsidizes every business.
there is very little competition and lnolivas
tion for greater profits For example. long
lines form In front of restaurants. and
when you finally get to the door. you can be
turned away with the explanation that
there is no more room. But. when you look

care ol you. you don’t have to worry about
keeping someone’s business."

Well. 1 suppose that‘s really all I wanted

Q: Do you see the women's movement or
civil rights orga tiuns using new ape
proaches to tackle the poverty problem?

A: intervention in lamily problems does
not lend itsell as readily to movement ac»
tivity as done lobbying‘ior a bill or an
amendment. We need the kind of
macroeconomic policy that will reduce
unemployment and regionalism. In the
1960's and 1970’s we had started to reduce
poverty rather substantially, but now it is
on the rise again. We've got to turn it
around.

0: What impact will tax reform and
Grliham-Rudman have on the poor?

A: I think tax reforms will help. It will take
people who cannot aliord to pay taxes on
the rolls. But Graham-Rudman has
already hurt. I don't see how they can keep
the targets, They are going to have pros
