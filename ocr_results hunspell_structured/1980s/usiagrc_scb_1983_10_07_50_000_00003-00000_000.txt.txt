Ronald Reagan

by Matt Woods

RONALD REAGAN 7 Too much has
already been argued and counter-argued
about the presidency oi Ronald Reagan to
do justice to the subject within the confines
of this article. A recent issue of New
Republic magazine addressed the fact that
on numerous occasions the press has had
the chance to pin Reagan in a very tight
situation,
manages to escape the attack. The reason
behind this is a key to a conservative 5 sup7
port or Reagan. Reagan is a leader; and
contrary to the belief of most students on
this campus, he is a popular leader.
Reagan is a strong figure in a position that,
since the Watergate scandal, has been sub
jected to strong criticism and paranoid
caution. Reagan s strength lies in his abilr
ty to take a strong stand on an issue —
something his two predecessors had been
unable to do.

As the nation’s chief executive, Reagan
understands that the country must be able
to assume the challenges of the iuture, but
he believes this to be an impossible task to

yet somehow he always-

accomplish ii tradition and heritage are
forfeited, i-iis defense budget operates on
the sensible idea that no arms negotiations
can work until there is at least a rough
parity between the super-powers. Reagan
is committed to arms reductions, but
realizes that it is useless to bargain when
one has nothing to bargain with. Socond,
the ever controversial “Reagonomics” is a
sensible, long term approach to our coun-
try’s economic woes that has worked
beiore and is working now. Using supply-
side economics, Reagan attacks our
economic troubles at their source, not
their symptoms. Lastly, his ioreign policy
is tough and has restored America’s
credibility as a true leader once again,

Although this conservative disagrees
heartily with Reagan's education and con
servation policies, Ronald Reagan has
restored to this country something that
had been missing — purposeiul direction
and leadership

JOHN GLENN 7 Senator John Glenn,
like Mr. Reagan, has very strong leader
ship qualities. A recent straw poll, reveal»
ed that Glenn appears to be Walter Mon»
dale’s main competition for the
Democratic nomination. The poll inter-
preted the race to be a battle between
political organization versus popular
leadership and dynamics. indeed. Glenn
has the charisma and inspiration of a true
leader. Unfortunately, he is not as well ac-
quainled with the full scope of political
organization as are his opponents. Many of
his policies seem inconsistent or contrary.
Glenn is quick to make general. broad
statements about what should be done to
remedy certain problems, but has little
grasp on how to apply them empirically.
Examples of this include his “Council for
Economic Cooperation” cooperation

‘ among labor, industry and iinance. He is

very indecisive as to what specific roles
the government should play in the
economic recovery. yet he is quick to
criticize the Reagan administration [or its
moves.

Yet Glenn remains in the Iorelront
because he is a popular, strong iigurc. in
many areas, he is very strong-wriled and
purposciul. This conservative supports
some of Glenn's agricultural policies and
his devotion to an old friend, NASA. As a
leader, Glénn could steer the Country in
the right direction, but only with help from
a strong intelligent cabinet. Drawing upon
his popularity, Glenn could unite such a
cabinet and create a strong government,

GEORGE BUSH 7 Vice President
George Bush is the most underestimated
of all possible presidential candidates.
Like many vice presidents, Bush suffered
irom virtual anonymity. A summer New
York poll revealed that over one half of all
pollsters had no idea of whom he was. This
is iurther compounded by the strength and
attention or Reagan's character.

Bush has not spoken out much on any
type of independent policy predilections in-
stead favoring to work as one of Reagan‘s
right-hand men. One of the most notable of
Bush’s accomplishments concerns his
chairmanship of Reagan’s Task Force for
Regulator Reliei, the administration's ai-
tempt to control the adverse effects of big
government. Bush has streamlined such

bureaus as OSHA (Ofﬁce of Safety and
Healﬂ'i Administration), the FDA, and the
National Highwary Tratiic Safety Ad
ministration. These sensitive bureaus
have been made more efiicieni, allowing
for more money in the general federal
revenue.

Unfortunately, Bush does not seem to be
the best choice [or a leader. He has a Com~
mand of the politic-larena, but lacks the
dynamics or assertiveness of a Reagan or
Mondale. He functions best where he is
now —.a subordinate position.

GARY HART 7 Senator Gary Hart is
perhaps one or the most outspoken iris
dividuals in the area of defense and arms
reduction and a very prominent iigure in
the liberal camp. However, while a
number of Hart's policies appear very ap
propriate, his overall campaign approach
is much too unrealistic. His two most
reasonable programs include his educa-
tion package, which, with a little trimmr
ing, would please liberal and conservative
alike while creating a superb educational
system; and parts of his deicnsc plan,
Hart is committed to a quantitative,
simplistically efficient emphasis in
defense instead of costly. overs
complicated equipment.

i. / - ‘
Gary Hart

Yet from a conservative viewpoint,
Hart’s arms control, economic and foreign
policies are simply laughable. He refuses
to accept the need for any us. presence in
the Middle East or Central America. He
has turned his head to the threats those
areas pose to World and national security
and wish to stay uninvolved 7 to isolate
the US. from the world. Hart duires arms
reduction but unrealistically believes that
one can negotiate from a position of
definitive weakness His economic policies
reveal an unwillingness to work with the
Federal Reserve Board on equal terms
and he does not seem to be working
towards a harmonious relationship bet
ween business and labor. Hart claims that
he is receiving no aid from the PACE
(Political Action Committees) so that he is
responsible to the people themselves. Such
an idea, while noble, illustrates his basic
unwillingness to work within the system of
political organizations. Such an attitude
could only lead to discord and ill will
among his administration. And while Hart
has an admirable record in the protection
of civil rights for minorities, he has little
concern or appeal to the wishes of the ma-
jority oi Americans. Hart seems to be
more of a “Crusader of the downtrodden"
than a candidate truly of the entire
populace.

Walter Mondale

WATER MONDALE 7 Walter “Fritz"
Mondale at the time holds the lead in the
Democratic nomination race. As vice
president to Jimmy Carter, Mondale has
inherited a knowledge oi the political
system that he has forged into a very eiiec-
tive organization Recently, Mondale has
received the support of the National
Education Association and the AFLVCIO,
both long time strongholds oi the
Democratic party. However, there are two
inherent weaknesses wiﬂ-lin the Mondale
campaign. The first deals greany with the
support he just received. Mondale,
although he has created a formidable
coalition, has now subjected himself to
some or the most poweriul lobbying groups
in the US. and it is hard to believe that he
will not by turn in many directions once he
is elected. A second problem is more con-
jecture than fact. Mondale lacks the
charisma and dynamics of some of his
competitors a to put it succinctly, he is
rather bland. This lack of a dynamic im-
age could be easily misinterpreted as .
decison and could lead to confusion and in
direction within his administration.

Overall, Mondale is a very intelligent
man with strong political and popular
backing. His middle of the road policies,
while not as strong as could be, provide an
interesting illustration of a bipartisan
government.

ALAN CRANSTON 7 Alan Cranston of
California is the most liberal of all
Democratic candidates. Unfortunately,
Cranston is too far left to appeal to the
substantial majority oi the population.
Cranston is a good example oi a candidate
representing one small part at society. His
most vocal platiorm concerns disarma»
ment. He is a strong advocate of complete
nuclear disarmament and has strongly
suggested the principle of unilateral ac-
tion. Cranston has based his campaign
almost totally on this policy and only
receives support from the small core of
most ardent anti-nuclear forces. He does
not after an across one board plan to en-
compass all areas or government, but
seems more interested in the volatile emo-
tions at one issue. In this writer’s opinion,
Cranston does not offer distinct. viable op»
tions for die majority or questions that this
country has, and thus, lacks the depth of
his other competitors.
