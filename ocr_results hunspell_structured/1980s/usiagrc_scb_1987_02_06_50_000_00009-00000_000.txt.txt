“What are the Fine Young Cannibals?"
Ever since it was heard that the Cannibals
might be coming to campus this semester,
this has been a question heard all over
Grilmity. Well. they are not the savage.
flesh-eating clan their name implies. In
fact. since their debut album was released
last year. they are quickly becoming "the
new thing" from England

Made up of eX'EngllSl'I'BeaterS David
Steele and Andy Cox. and singer Roland
Gift. the Cannibals and their producers
have made an album with integrity AND
pop appeal, The two Singles irom the
album, "Johnny Come Home" and
"Suspictous Minds are both harddrivmg
atice tracks. "suspicious Minds" is a
over at an ElVls Presley song, so the
'lmust obligatory twangy guitar-s give this
orig a country sound and feel that al the
me time make ll vcry danceable,

There are so many ditlcrcnt styles oi

right now. the album FINE YOUNG CANr
NIBALS serves as the pause that
reireshes. tSo what it it's a 45 minute
pausezi

An example or the diversity and mixing
or styles by the Cannibals is the sad ballad
"Funny How Love-Is " By blending Latina
intluenced guitar and percussion tracks
iiitli a jazz solo on top. they have made a
pop song out oi two non-pop music styles.

Much oi the lyrical content oi the album
is rather downbeat. to say the least Many
oi the songs dcal Vtith dead or dying relur
timisliips and the nasty Ieelings that go
\Htii that territory. The lunky beat at
“Johnny Come Home" hides the desperate
pica tor the return oi a runaway son

This is an album tilled with interesting
songs and good musicianship it will be in.

Krejci Exhibit Reviewed

by Julee Brown

A bat-winged woman alights irom a
mangled unicorn Another ilaunts her tan
line while crouched over a double—edged
razor. An infant has simultaneous visions
of fetal life and Jiml Hendrix, a rock idol
swoons after cleaning his chest wound.
Such are the incidents through which
Czechoslovakian artist Jan Krejci
presents both his erotic fantasies and
nightmare reactions to modern society.

The exhibition or drawings and prints by
Krejci, currently on loan to Grinnell by
Betty and Gerald Werksman, attests to the
artist's technical genius and sensitive
understanding of cultural dehumanization.
His prevalent themes. conveyed most
otten through the iemale nude, range from
birth, puberty, aging, and death to sex.
random violence, nuclear holocaust. and
hero worship. Further, the “deliberate
chaos" realized in Krejci's crowded com-
positions parallels the confusion and
alienation experienced by individuals in
urban societies, Although his is a clearly

pessimistic View of humanity, KrejCi does
not preach despair: instances of humor,
beauty. and compassion imply hope tor the
future

The graphic displays oi lemale nudity
which dominate this exhibit may be con
sldered unnecessary and offensive by
some viewers. Although the sexual act is a
recurrent motif in Krejci's oeuvre, the mar
Jority oi these female nudes are gratuitous
figures, and accusations of sexual ex-
ploitation at first seem justified Yet while
the women in Krejci's compositions do eXr
ist primarily ior reasons or aesthetics,
they are never treated solely as objects.
These nudes are not vulnerable, but rather
strong and willful indi 'duals capable of
expressing pride, delight, sadness, and
compassion. The artist is undeniably
fascinated by the female form. while it
seems that his admiration of sexism and
exploitation are left to the individual
viewer

The KreJci exhibit, located in the Burl-
ing Library Print and Drawing Study
Room, will run through March 13.

Gay communities of one kind or another
have always existed, although it Seems
that they have only recently “come out” to
the larger society. BEFORE
