Transfers describe academic pressures

by Laura Carter

Sttittsttcs released recently concern
ing academic attrition over the past
live senteslers have created questions
In the minds ol the Grinnell community
and have set rumors flying across cam-
pus. These questions ask uhy the
number oi suspensions and dismissals
has increased, how large the increase
in and iihat the consequences ol the ills
crease are.

And the rumors have supplied a
variety oi the anstters, most 01 which
are given without knou ledge oi Grin-
ncll’s policies or criteria against which
Grinnell can be compared In order to
learn the policies one may check the
student handbook and to find some
criteria to compare one may ask about
the 'expcriences and impressions oi
Grinnell 5 transler students.

The school s total enrollment at the
beginning oi this semester “as 1,187
and about 200 oi these studentscanie to
Grinnell alter attending other institu
tions, The reasons that they ielt the
other schools are as varied as the lib
diilerent schools from which they
came. Some translerred because their
academic interests changed and others
favored the size 0] a smaller school

Russell Fierce, who left Drake
University aIter the 197879 academic
year and is now a Junior said. "I
thought Grinnell nould have a more “1'
tellectually stimulating environment ”
Others. such as Jenny Hoover, viho
came to Grinnell her sophomore year in
19791rom Wellesley College wanted to
escape what she savt as the East
Coast, lvy snyndrome. Robert Alehr

year at oosevelt University- in Chicago

nell most feel that they can look at the
school objectively, without the in»
tluenc‘e oi Admissions UIIice hype and
with some experience to drau lrom.
Christiane Carney, who attended pun
due University until translerring this
year as a sophomore, said, "There isn't
a tense kind oi leeling in the air and at
Purdue it has unbelievably horrible.

Peg Van Valeii, a sophomore transier
iroin Bcloit College, said. "I thought
Beloil and Grinnell itould be very
simil‘ The caliber here is about the
same ' She continued, "I in being
challenged but it s not an ovcruhelm-
ing challenge

-~l've seen hon things could be
better: admitted Anson Rohr, a Junior
who came to Grinnell train the Univer-
sity oi Northern Colorado in the [all oi

There's a lot oI busy uoi-k. it has no

bearing on real lilc

These three perspectives represent
the varying levels ol academic
pressure that transler students see at
Grinnell. litany agree with Carney that
the school's "more personal at»
mosphere relieves pressure and coni-
petition " Bill Boyrer, a senior who
came to Grinnell in 1979 mm the
U versity oi Santa c , concurred,

ere is pressure bul it's not been lor-
malized The institution is not explicitly
promoting pressure ‘

others lecl Van Valen is on target and
that pressure is constant but is not over
uhelmiiig, "Students here take their
studies very sermusly.‘ explained
Alexander Time might be better
allotted it they- took things more easily
but there's ti lairly nice balance bet
ween academics iind social lile.

Hoover said. “Maybe lour times a
semester thitigs go crazy . on the whole
they don't, ’

Another group linds hohr's viewpoint
closer to the mark ”Sometimes there is
ttrltlng lor the sake ol \mllng. \Htl’l no
purpose,‘ said Pierce,

"Sometimes they «the studentst are
utider too much pressure," said Kathy
Zimmerman, a sophomore who
transieri-ed irom Mount Holyoke col
lege this past lall. "They don‘t knou
hou to be SdllSIled vtith d B.”

Those who agreed that there is
pressure at Grinnell disagree as to
vthere this pressure comes lrom. "11 s
not the people, it s the hay the schools

Hovtever, blame was also placed on
the student‘s individually. "It's not the
institution, it's the person in the institue
tion," said Pierce. Zimmerman
asserted, "It's ,not the lault oi the
system,"

Transler students also disagree on
the issue of competition. Pierce
thought, "The students here are more
individually competitive uithin
themselves tthan with othersl," Alexe
ander concurred, "About to percent is
personal and only 20 percent is between
students '

"The are individually competitive
people," agreed Hoover, ”But there are
a lot oi people here who are kindeol
lackluster. (They seem to sayi ‘I‘m at
Grinnell and I didn't get into Harvard, I
didn't get into Yale, so I'm just
average.‘ "

The other Side 01' the coin is also
represented. "I do think it's a Cut-
throat atmosphere; said Zimmerman.
"Especially with those aiming lor med
school and good grad schools," And
Boyrer reported, “l have iriends in
sciences who are getting.lab stuII
stolen.‘ (

All those interviewed l'eel thalthe
quality or work demanded by the Grins
nell laeulty is high, though Hoover said,
"Some professors demand a lot and ac-
cept less. Access to faculty members
is also reported as high. "When the prol
says, -Come talk to me about your
paper; he means it," continued
Hoover However, Pierce added.
“Students and laculty can get together
but the question is, hovt eiiective are
those meetings" '

Another point on which there tias
unanimous agreement was the mad,
quacy oI Burling Library Various d-
yectives were oilered by the transier
students to describe the building, in
cluding: kind-oi loud, confining, cold
and totally inellective. "For a school
that expects scholarly work, the library
is not conducive to scholarly work,‘
said Pierce.

Honever, there was no consensus on
where one can eiiectively study.
”Dorms are a gray rea,‘ said Boyrer.
Alexander and Limmerman both
recommended the Science Library but
lelt that it is too small. "It might be nice
around l'inal times to keep another
building open," suggested Alexander.

Hoover felt that, --MoViiig bit campus
makes a diii'eretice, You can get real
neurotic about your viork but no one’s
lorcing you. 1 can enyoy the classes and
prol's but I dont vtant to take all that
college has to oiier "
