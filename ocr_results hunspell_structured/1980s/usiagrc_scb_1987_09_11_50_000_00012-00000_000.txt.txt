Tire timing of this popular
song by Mojo Nixon and Skid
Roper could not have been more
appropriate than on the day
that the Graceland Elvis_Pres-
leys came into the Gniircltv to
face the as-yet—nnchallengerl Pie
oneer football team. For those
oi you who have absolutely no
idea what I am talking about.
listen closely. The football team
from Graeeland College earne
here last Saturday to play our
own football team iii a con-
trolled scrimmage. No score’or
oﬁicial stats were kept. (time
nell‘s performance in the serim-
irra e was encouraging for tins
ear y in the season, with no ma-
jor holes or problems showing
up. The problems most appar-
ent concern basic skills thatJust
need to be reﬁned before the reg-
ular season. In that respect, it
is fortunate that the Pioneers
have this week oil‘ to hone tech-
niques before they race Concora
din of Illinois, or else it could be
Heartbreak Hotel.

V-ball Improves:
on Wood

by Grant Ehrlich

After a spectacular prergallic
warm-up Saturday, the blende-
penned Lady Statesmen oi‘Di
sionall William Penn undiplo»
inatically displaced oiir ladies in
two straight scrimmage matches.
The key to the game was teaina
work and the envoys from the
0seuloosa had just a little more.
Nonetheless, our women in red
had some great plays. The best
were eentered around setters
Jessica Tort and Joanne Sarkett
who combined with the iiicreda
ible hitting talents of Shannon
Carr and Melissa Fitzpatrick.
When these ladies came. to-
ether they could deliver the

all with incredible force, yet to
overcome the Lad Statesmen,
this was not enough.

Looidng baek on the game,
most players and spectators
would agree that Grinnell played
'quite well, much improved over,
last year‘s showing. This week-
end the women's volleyball team
will host the Grinueil lnvita»
tionai. The tournament starts
Friday night, September ii, at
6:00 RM. in the PEG, mid cont
tinnes on Saturday.
