Out of Africa, Part 2

By Elizabeth Banﬁeld

Have you ever wanted to see some
authentic Africanartbutthoughtyou
couldn’t endure the pain of endless
slides in an ArtHistory course? Well,
now is your bi gchance to experience
some authentic west and central
African art first hand.

ThestudentsofartprofcssorRich-
ardCervene ’s freshman tutorial have
put together part two of a unique
show, “West and Central African
Art: Creative Records“ in the lobby
of the Fine Arts building The stu-
dents have been focusing on African
art thissemester and have chosen the
works for this show from Grinnell’s
permanent art collection

The show is filled with a variety of
African treasures featuring elabo-
rate ceremonial masks and head
pieces. While most works are renA
dercd with material such as stained
wood.beads,ivory andbits of metal.
one head piece sports some actual
human hair to achieve its desired
effect.

One particularly dramatic piece is
a “fetish ﬁgure“ that is builtaround

anactualapesculland
covercdwith feathers, . ,
cowrie shells, fur and
an animal claw. Cer-
vene poignantly de- .
scribes this frightful'
piece as “a nice Hair
loween gift” Clearly,
such a work must be
SEC/1 and not heard.
Other works of a
more tempered nature
include an ivory
bracelet and a clev-
erly carved “prestige ‘i
portrait pipe.” Hang-
ing on the walls are

we mas

four generous pieces Richard Cervene displays a piece from the

of hand woven “vel-
vet cloth" The artists
of these wonks integrate black and
beige natural ﬁbers to create tex-
tured geometrical patterns.
Although these works are several
hundred years old, they immediately
remind the viewer of the modern art
movement of Cubism that was popu-
larized in Western cultureonly within
the last century by artists such as Pi-
casso. Cervene shares the view of

Dii-ing Without Hiisker

By Andrew Hamilton

Bob Mould, former singer and
guitarist of the avant~garde under-
ground band Husker Du, will bring
his musical thunder to campus this
Saturday night. Mould led Husker
Du as they rode the edge of subcul-
ture prominence until the progres-
sive Minneapolis trio broke up in
1988.

Husker Du were pioneers in the
underground music scene. For nine
yearsandeightalbums,theypounded
outstraight-forward, uncompromis-
ing lyrics and music with enough
power to level barns. Since theband’s
painful split, Mould has produced
his firstsolo album. Workbook, and
is now on the road performing.

Mould’s new album shows many
sides and depths previously only
hinted at in his music. The inclusion
oflane Scarpantoni's cello work on
the new album allows for some of
the most subtle and moving expres-
sion which Mould has yet achieved
tScarpantonia member of the group
Tiny Lights. is a classically trained
cellist. Mould explained his deci-
sion to give the cello prominence in
someof his new music: “Cello is one
ofthe main instrumean I’m hearing
in my work now. It‘s a very, very
emotional instrument, andithasalot
of similarities to what I like soni-
cally about the guitar."

Scarpantoni’s moving cello-play-
ing on Warkbookallows such pieces
as “See a Little Light" and “Sinners
and Their Repentances" to prescnta
more developed expression of emo-
tions which can be seen in rougher

form in earlier Husker Du classics
suchas‘TooFarDown"and“Hardly
Getting Over It."

Although Workbook doesn‘t sus-
tain the intense mayhem energy of
many ofHuskerDu'salbumthnew
ertheless exhibits burstsofthatsame
high-level emotion and power. While
Scarpantoni exerts a controlling and
pensive inﬂuence on the music of
Workbook, bassist Tony Maimonc
(of Perc Ubu) and drummer Anton
Fier (theGolden Palominos) havean
explosiveinﬂuence.Thedrivingbass
and drums on the album exhibit a
careful energy which is dammedrup
and then unleashedinperiodicﬂoods
with stunning effect.

The albumiscarefullyconducted.
undulating from dark remorse to
ecstatic upswings of crashing emo-
tion. From the ﬁrst uprtoeing notes
of the opening piece, “S unspots,” to
the final screaming chords of
“Whichever Way the Wind Blows,"
the album is completely engrossing.
There is never a dull moment, as
Mould’s music is constantly work—
ing to create images of hope, de-
spair,anduncontrollablefrenzy.This
is outrageous musical power, con-
trolled and conducted with a sense
of purpose

Reﬂecting on his new album,
Mould said, “I think 1 ripped away a
lot of the protective layers 1 used to
wrap myself in." Mould’snewmusic
shows that he has indeed dug deeper
and schucked-off some extra thick
skin. But at the same time, he has
wisely retained the aspects of his
daring music which make it live and
breathe and scream.

THE LONGHORN

Down and Out in Turkey

By Jennifer Mattes

For the beleaguered prisoners in
Alan Parker’s aptly titled 1978 film,
the term “midnight express" is a
code expression for escape. As such.
it is their only hope of both literal
and spiritual liberation from the dark
innards of a Turkish prisont How
ever, most of them have ceased to
hope, and they are listless, wracked
with torture and trapped for life
within one of the harshest, most in,
humane prison systems in the world.

When a young American, played
by BradDavis,is bustedforattempb
ing to smuggle drugs across the
Turkish border, he is unwittingly
thrust into this surreal, dungeon»like
aunosphere, and the film deals with
his efforts to survive in it.

The question of how to maintain
dignity and spirit in the face of inhu-
mane conditions is thoroughly ex-
plored by Parker. A fellow prisoner
who befriends Davis is an example
of the breakdown that almost inevi-
tably occurs after repeated subjec—

 

tion to sadism and unhealthy depri-
vationtlohn Hurtobviously special-
izes in these types of roles, As in‘
1984, the British actor is in his
emaciatedmode, and he is gradually
reducedtoastick-like,soullessdere-
liction, a symbol of besieged intel-
lect at the mercy of humankind’s
baser impulses.

Differing cultural views of crime
and judicial leniency also permeate
the film Davis is the prototypical
young American who thinks he can
get away with his crime, believing
himself immune to the tribulations
of a foreign judicial system by virtue
of his American citizenship.

Midnight Express is an example
of the graphic, violent realism of
many 70’s movies, and has many
gut-wrenching sequences. Indeed,
the initial scene in which Davis is
caught by the Turkish police is one
of the most tightly coiled sequences
of tension ever ﬁlmed.

The ﬁlm leaves an unsettling,
unforgettable impression of freedom
mistakenly taken for granted. .
