Sloan grant
to help with
techno-skills

by John Haggard

With the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s
grant of $250,000 to Grinnell College, the
school‘s graduates will now be able to han»
dle numbers as Well as they handle
words.

The program, outlined in a proposal sent
to ﬁle Sloan Foundation last fall (see “A
Proposal to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
from Grinnell College, Sept. l, 1992, on
Burling Library's permanent reserve),
represents Grinnell's attempt to equip
future graduates with the quantitative
problem-solving skills that will be
necessary as the use of technology in socie»
ty advances.

The liberal arts education, according to
the proposal, is one which frees the student
from being locked into one mode of
thought, an education which enables the
student to apply thought processes learned
at college to any situation encountered in
the “real" world.

The Sloan Program parallels the imr
provement in writing skills implemented
by freshman tutorials, the writing lab and
the various designated writing courses. In
the same spirit, the problemsolving pro-
gram will improve the students analytical
abilities.

Charles Jepsen, professor of
mathematics and director of the Sloan
Program Committee, emphasized that the
purpose of the program is not a matter or
understanding how to work on a specific
computer, but rather knowing what can be
done with a specific problem.

The software purchased will be a tool
which students may use in applying the
theory they have learned in class. This use
should be of special interest to macro-
economic students in particular, an area in
which application is currently a weak
point.

The basic structure of the program, ac
cording to the proposal, consists of three
levels of problem-solving, Level One will
be made up of “a series of ‘designated
problem-solving courses’ designed to
strengthen the quantitative problem-
solving ability of all students in their early
college careers.” Level Two will cover
the sophomore and junior course levels
and Consisb of “a mathematical modeling
component" of those courses. Level Three
will be at the senior level and will com-
prise seminars and internships dealing
specifically with “dilierent technologies
and their implications" and generally
what place technology holds in society,

When will all this hit Grinnell? The first
part of the program begins this summer.
with student and faculty internships in
various technological fields. Next tall, live
to 10 Grinnell students at the Third Level
will attend lull-time internships in
Washington, D.C,, arranged through the
Washington Center. In the spring, the col»
lege plans to introduce a senior seminar in
technology,'which will not. necessarily be a
continuation of the first semester's intern-
ships, although it may serve as a good
followup.

Jepsen explained that in tuner levels of
the program the outcome of next fall
depends on getting individual departments
to revise outdated courses. Departments
are working together this spring in order
to coordinate implementation of courses
which can be considered as the ground-
work for the higher levels oi the program.

The success of the program depends
upon both interdepartmental cooperation
and a yearly evaluation of the program for
the first three years, which will iron out
unforeseen problems. Said Jepsen, “Just
because it's written on paper doesn’t mean
that it’s defi going to happen.” He
continued thati his hope that the faculty
can coordinate their efforts and make the
program work, because he sees it as being
a potential strength for Grinnell

‘F’reeoze and Disarm’
prowdes awareness

Campus group gaining popularity

by Ken Scotton

Discussion and activism in protest of ﬁle
nuclear arms race is not new to Grinnell.
Convocation speakers and films shown by
chaplain Haas bring the issue into the
campus eye every once in a while. Perhaps
the event that has had the most participa-
tion was the die-in during Ground Zero
week last sping.

However, there has been a lack of con
tinuity and direction in the movement here
on campus. Concerned with these pro
blems, Gail Fisher and Hugh Deaner
decided to start an organization called
Freeze and Disarm this semester to pro-
vide some of these missing elements. AC-
cording to Fisher, “The purpose of Freeze
and Disarm is to create more awareness
through discussion and to provide an outlet
for people who want to help."

The organization, now only a month old,
already has over 130 members and has
successiully circulated a petition declar-
ing the campus a nuclear free zone. This
declaration, although not legally binding,
bans the production, storage, disposal.
detonation and transportation oi nuclear
weapons on campus.

~ Some students have expressed the view
that there is not any present threat that
deems necesssary the taking of such steps
as declaring the college a nuclear free
zone. Freeze and Disarm Organizer Hugh
Deaner admits that the proclamation is his
deed “symbolic” and is mainly
“something to show the general attitude of
the college to people." But as to whether
there is any real threat, Deaner thinks that
“It’s rather short sighted of people to think
that Grinnell isn‘t on the hit list,”

Another objection to the petition held by
some is the idea of renouncing the right to
be defended by nuclear weapons. These
people, including President George Drake,
refused to sign the petition on the grounds
that this was a call [or unilateral disarma-
ment.

Despite these objections, 645 people
agreed to sign the petition. With this ma-
jority, the couege now joins ranks with
whole continents, South America and An»
taretica, as well as many cities across
Europe and North America in becoming a
nuclear free zone.

noeze and Disarm plans to send copies
of the signatures to the Des Moines
Register, the Grinnell Heraldkegister
and to local and state representatives,

Freeze and Disarm is also trying to in-

 

crease student support far and involve-
ment in the referendum for a freeze on the
testing and production of nuclear arms
that goes before the Unites States House on
March 9. The referendum is not ceiling for
unilateral disarmament, but rather is a
call for negotiations to start immediately
between Washington and Moscow.

 

A few students are going to Washington
to participate in the National Citizens Lob-
by fora Nuclear Freeze convention that is
being held to try to persuade House
members to pass the referendum, For
those who want to help but are staying on
campus, Freeze and Disarm has schedul-
ed a lettervwriting campaign for next
Wednesday (March 2). The film A War
Without Winners will be shown prior to the
campaign.

Freeze and Disarm will also be holding a
film festival during the following week
that will coincide with the convention in
Washington. Possible films include The
Atomic Cafe and two films from the
American Security council to represent
the other side of the issue.

A symposium on disarmament is also
being planned by Freeze and Disarm for
April. Among others, Colorado Senator
Gary Hart, a presidential candidate
strongly opposed to nuclear arms, will be
speaking, as well as Jonathon Schell,
author of The Fate 0! the Earth.

In the organization of these events.
Freeze and Disarm is receiving some help
from the Grinnell Peace Fellowship. The
Fellowship, organized a year ago, is a
group with viewpoints similar to that of
Freeze and Disarm. Its membership in-
cludes mostly college faculty and staff,
although a few town restdents and students
are members.

Pres., VP

candidates
announced

by Jane Kaufman

Political Activites Fund guidelines and
debate over funding to the Women's Group
dominated Wednesday nights (SGA) Joint
Board meeting. In addition candidates for
SGA president and vice president were an~
nounced.

Peder Fretheim attached an amend
ment requiring the chair to report on the
reasons past guidelines have been waived
and placing a limit of $200 on the amount
allowable ior PASF funding. In defense of
his amendment Fretheim explained, “I
think it‘s best if we give them (PASF) a
degree of autonomy...PASF‘ still has flex-
ibility."

Wes Joe, co-chair of PASF, accepted the
amendment as “unfriendly" (one which
requires a separate vote from the
guidelines) stating, “If you really think
that we are not giving as full a report as we
should be, you really should talk to me.”

In reply to Joe, Eric Secoy, Initiative
Funds Committee chair argued, “I don’t
know why you're having problems accepr
ting ﬂlis. I can’t see why it’s that cone
troversial. The committee can still,,.go up
to $200 as long as they do it unanimously.”

Secoy proposed an amendment stating
that only in may grant funding of an ac-
tivity that benefits less than 20 people. The
guidelines and both amendments were
passed by approximately a 2:1 margin.

Peter Hautzinger, SGA nonvoting
member to PASF, brought forward for JB
approval PASF‘s decision to grant
Women’s Group $62.50 [or 10 people to at-
tend a conference. Jeff Schmidt, IFC
member, stated, “i think that n3 should
know why iFC turned them down." Karen
Rose, another IFC member, emphasized
that, “Either they misrepresented
themselves to us or they misrepresented
themselves to the Finance
Committee...'l‘hey came to us as lo in
dividual students going to a conierence.”

Tracy Thoma, student coordinator,
argued, “I don’t think we can reward peo-
ple for being organized after the fact." JB
proceeded to override PASF’S decision to
grant funding to the Women’s Group by a
3:1 margin.

Robin Hartung, administrative assistant
announced the candidates of president and
vice president or SGA, They are Jon
Scharii and Robbie Sckalor for president
and Pete Hautzinger and Guy Montag {or
vice president.

The Loose l-lall Ball Budget of $69150
was brieily discussed and unanimously ap-
proved,

John Mofiet, SGA president, reported on
a meeting that he had with Janet Carl,
representative to the Iowa Legislature.
Regarding the bill to increase the drinking
age, Moffet stated, “She believed that it
was Stuck in committee.”

Mollet also informed JB that he had
talked with President Drake. “He (Drake)
told me a little more about the resolution
concerning the Federal Selective Service
Bill. The college is talking with college
lawyers in order to combat the bill."
