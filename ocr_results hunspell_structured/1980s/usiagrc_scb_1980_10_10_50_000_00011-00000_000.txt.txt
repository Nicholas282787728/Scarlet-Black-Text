However. Conyers does not feel
Judicial CounCIl. a hearing board with
the power to punish violations of
students rights, always presents the
best mechanism for solving problems.
"I’d like to make OCR (Office of Com-
munity Rights) more of an actIve and,
useful body,“ he explained. "I think
then people {eel like they've made-a

decision instead of having it forced on’

them." He went on to say, “In a lot of
cases it would be better than Judicial

Council,ospecially when people have to .

r live together at the end,"

Concerning Curriculum Council Con-
yzrs takes a more advisory stance. The
Council composed of representatives
from each EPC ﬁdiscusses curricular

policies and takes their recommenda»

tions, to the Joint'faculty/student 0m
rlculum Committee, -
_ “i called the first Curriculum Council

‘meeting melee! officers as per my

duties," he Said. ”Nothing of substance
was brought up because I think it‘s oon~

, trary to the intent of the Council for me

to run their meetings; they need to
discuss things with their own chain"
“Its hard for students to present a
coherent polIcy, raid Conyers so ”the
Curriculum Donnell has had a lot of pro-
blame in terms of being impotent."
However he plans to make suggestions
help the body become stronger. “i
think a idiot peopleou EPC's III-mt

freally clear about their duties. To look

at the whole EPC now is important." he

explained “Obviously, I need to t
Dean Frazer; she seems interested In
helping.”

One matter of importance belore the
Council noted Cnnyers, is that “lnter-'
disciplinary concentrations are up for
review and the fact that the money is no
longer so free makes an investigation
even more necessary."

But ultimately, Conyers believes the,
effectiveness of the Council ”depends
on what the students interests are, and
student interest is generated by the
amount of effort put in by other
students. "

Conyers looks forward to the re
mainder ot the year for working on our
jects concerning SGA as a whole an
those relating to his constitutional-
duties. “I need to give some impetus,
not force." he stressed ”I'm more than
glad to make the resource of my time
available.”

Efficiency guides Campbell's office/e

by Richard Letchlnger

“i spent this summer planning so that
we could be time and resource
efficient," commented a very confident
Anna Marie Campbell, SGA’s student
coordinator.

The student coordinator's job in»
volves coordinating all SGA Student
services and service projects and serv-
ing as the co—chairperson or the Campus
Coordinating Committee with Social
Coordinator Chris Nylander. She is also
the designated campus ombudsman.

“The role of the ombudsman has
decreased from what it was in the late
50's and early 70’s," Campbell said.
“Then it was a large part of the coor-
dinator's job." The ombudsman's job is
to serve as an official student represen~
tative in student complaints againsl
members of the faculty. Campbell ex
plained that she felt that not many peo»
ple knew that she was there to serve as
a mediator. “i would like to see some
cases,” she remarked. “i feel I can
handle it."

The main role of the student coor-
dinator, though, is to organize
“everything from blood drives to shut-
tles," said Campbell. So with her staff
at Terry Gould, Amy Welch, Karen"
Reif, and Tracy Wold she organizes a
myriad of student services.

The furniture auction was one of her
office's eallest projects. Used furniture
was made available to students to help
alleviate the problem of lounge fur~
niture finding its way into student's
rooms, "I am personally displeased
with the vandalism that takes place,"
Campbell said. So, since the auction
was such a success, she hopes to see it

October it), 1980

became an established event. “We just
have to figure out how we are going to
replenish the supply of furniture."
Another successful event that she is
involved with is the record service,
“It's been very successful this year due
to good organization from my
assistant,” Campbell explained. “Lots
of people are getting records cheap.”
Upcoming events that her office is
working on include a blood drive Oct.
29, 30, and 31 and the shuttles for 0c-
tober break. “I think that this is one of
the most interesting aspects of my
join.H Cambell said of the shuttles. This
year they will be oflering shuttles to
Des Moines and Chicago. Campbell ex-
plained that the shuttle program really
worked to everyone‘s benefit. SGA has
projected to make a total prom ol $300
on the project and me students to
Chicago are saving money. The round
trip hus tare on Greyhound is $56, as
compared to SGA’S $42 price.
Campbell also said that there are
plans to expand the program for
Christmas break. “We want to go to
Minneapolis and Kansas City In addir
tion to Chicago and Des Moines,"
Campbell explained. “If we can get
enough interest we are going to try an
airline charter to New York also."
Another project that Is in the hopper
for her office is the Student Services
Directory. “1 did it last year,” (Lamp-
bell said, “and I want to apologize to the
campus community for doing a crum~
my job." Campbell explained that this
year they are trying to produce a more
comprehensive book; one that would
not only include services in town, but
also those of the SGA and other college

 

clubs and organizations, She said that
she hoped to make the book available
after October break.

Other Ideas that she is working on are
a Short Term Loan Program, which she
hopes to get implemented by February,
and a Student Legal Service, which she
said is presently a “sore point with the
Trustees."

“I like this job very much." Campbell
said, “and I've been spending lots of
time analyzing how this office should
work. i don't like to waste people's
time." 1 1
