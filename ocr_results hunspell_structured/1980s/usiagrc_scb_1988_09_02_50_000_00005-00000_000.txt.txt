A look at the Grinnell
of yesteryear

15 years ago, 8/31/73
ADMISSION PRIORITIES

President Glenn Leggett and
the board of trustees detailed new
admission priorities and stressed a
need for quality and diversity in
recruiting. Their three main ob-
jectives are the admission of
more sons and daughters of Grin-
nell alumni. admission of more
Iowa students, and admission of
more minority students. They
also wish to acknowledge athletic
talent in applicants when it is
coupled with academic profi<
ciency. With regard to recmit-
mentof Iowa students, they noted
that "the College has experienced
difﬁculty in attracting students
with small town and rural back-
grounds."

OVERCROWDING

Bob Jacobs, assistant dean of
student affairs, attributes ex-
tremely tight housing conditions
"to a lower attrition rate." There
are 25 requests pending for the
six single rooms that are avail~
able, One side effect of the
housing crunch has been poor
distribution of furniture. Some
double rooms have only one
dresser.

DINING SERVICES

The installation of a comput-
erized identification system, "a
radical and permanent departure
from tradition," according to the
Scarlet and Black, replaces the old
practice of manually checking
students' ID numbers from a list
as they enter the dining halls.
"Reactions to the drastic modern-
ization of the ID system range
from accusations of ’the begin-
nings of an Orwellian society' to
praise for its efficiency." One
sophomore said. ”It seems like
just another step toward a giant
bureaucracy." Dave McConnell
hails it as the first step in "the
whole computerization of our
dining system."

Another change is that "foods
low in nutrition and high in cost,

including potato chips. ice cream
cones. chocolate milk, and sugar-
coated cereals, have been phased
ouL McConnell emphasized that
one of his main considerations in
banning ice cream cones was that
they encourage students to ille-
gally carry food out of the cafete-
rla."

"I'm not out to change things
just for the sake of change; in
fact, I‘m just going back to the
old ways If you go back three
years, you‘ll ﬁnd that there never
were cones before I came here,"
McConnell said.

DRINKING AGE

Governor Robert Ray over
the summer signed a law
(effective July I, 1978) that
raised the legal drinking age from
18 to 19, Out of the 403
incoming freshmen, 176 are af-
fected by the law The Pub must
strictly monitor what students it
lets in because it could lose its
liquor license by serving to mi-
norsr The Pub came close to
losing its license two years ago
for serving beer on a Sunday.

OVERCROWDTNG

Director of housing Susan
Wittpenn cited two reasons for
the housing crunch that has
caused 52 students to be placed in
temporary housing: attrition is
down. and there are more incom-
ing students than were expected.
Large doubles and triples have
been turned into triples and
quadruples, respectively Students
also are living in study lounges,
PDRs, and powder rooms. All
juniors and seniors have been of-
fercd the option of moving to off-
campus housing.

OVERCROWDING

Due to a lower than expected
attrition rate coupled with a
higher than expected number of
incoming freshmen, Grinnell
College started the year over»
crowded by 44 students. according
to Diane Doughcrty, director of
student housing.

Organizations around campus

by John Newmark

As I was sitting at the
Freshmen Organization Fair last
Wednesday representing two or-
ganizations to which I belong,
two things crossed my mind.
First. not all the Freshmen were
there, meaning many didn't know
all the activities being offered.
Second, there are probably many
sophomores, junors, and seniors
who don't know all the activities,
In future weeks I will feature
various organizations which ei-
ther offer somewhat unique
activities for the Grinnell student,
or are new to the campus and
thus might be unknown to many
students My hope is to make
students more aware of the op-
tions that are open to them.
Many people say this is a boring
campus, but that is far from true
They just don't know what is
going on behind their backs,

Part I: The Grinnell

Forensics League

I shall start this series looking

at an organization that» was a

brainstorm second semester of
last year by two then Freshmen,
Tanwcer Akram and Beth
Wodzinski. They saw an over-
abundance of talent in the area of
public speaking and debate going
to waste, since there was no
Grinnell debate team. Due to
their efforts, and the help of oth-
ers who joined them, The Grin—
nell Forensics League was bom,
The name patterned after the Na-
tional Forensics League (NFL),
the GFL plans to offer such ac—
tivities as Original Oratory,
CEDA Debate, Extemporaneous
Speaking, Humorous and Dra-
matic Interpretations, and Duet
Acting. Their goal is to compete
not just against each other, but to
compete with other colleges and
universities in Iowa and neigh»
boring states.

While that in itself is a lofty
goal, the group doesn't plan to
stop there Already they are New
ning an offshoot of GFL, una
named as of yet, which will par-

ticipate in a collegiate Model
United Nations. Ideally Grinnell
would send a number of students
to represent countries to a mock
general assembly held at a nearby
University, They would debate
over international issues just as if
they were in a real U.N. Assem-
bly in New York.

The money for travel will
obviously be the biggest hurdle
the organization will have in
getting started. However, the
members seem hopeful they can
convince the administmtion of

how much recognition a
competitive forensics team and a
Model UN delegation would
bring for the college.

Convention
Continued Itom Page 4

of his mouth, the dozen or so ac-
tivists broke into a raucous
chant: "40,000 people dead,
where was George?" while wav-
ing "AIDSgate" signs. Bush
gamely talked on, utterly drowned
out by the protesters. Fortu-
itously. for Bush, the crowd

decided to take things into their
own hands. Several angered peo-
ple began grabbing for the
"AIDSgate" signs, while others
began counter-chanting Bush's
name. Then, rugby-style, the
crowd encircled the protesters and
policemen, and began pushing
them en masse towards the pe4
riphcry. After one or two
adrenalin-filled minutes, the
crowd won out, and a loud huzzah
went up as the interlopers were
expelled. All settled back to
normalcy as Bush gained the
floor. Playing to the hoard of
reporters, Bush slyly said to us.
”You know, I've been dorng
some hard thinking..." Cucd to
his intentions, everyone grew
silent as Bush prepared to wow
us with his unexpected running
mate announcelnent. As soon as
Bush announced the name of Dan
Quayle, Mike turned and gtumly
whispered to me, "He just lost
the election." At the same Lime, a
couple in front of me began a
victory jig; apparently they were
from Indiana. The mood of the
convention seemed to turn on
that moment when Bush let the
cat out of the bag. With Quayle
playing Robin to Bush's Batman,
many conventionccrs I talked to

were frustrated that Bush had
chosen such a lightweight for
VP. My perception of time sped
up as the convention began to
feel somewhat futile. But so
what, there was still a little more
fun in store
WEDNESDAY:
LOVE STEAMBOAT
Wednesday morning was
shot. I'd had a choice of attend-
ing one of the breakfasts hosted
by Bob Dole, George Bush, or
Gerald Ford. I slept through all
three, but did wake up in time to
board the steamboat "Creole
Queen" for a three-hour cruise
with the Iowa delegation. The
Queen took us to see the site
of the Battle of New Orleans,
which was interesting, but what]
enjoyed more was cruising with
none other than The Love Boat's
congressman Gopher - Fred
Grandy - on board. Unfortu-

nately, he dressed and acted like
the respectable guy he's
become-no white jacket, and no
hint of servility. But he was so-
ciable, and appreciated, as we all
did, the humor of the situation.

THURSDAY: BURNING
BUSH

On Thursday, George Bush
returned to his moderate
Republican roots and said nice
things about bureaucrats and bad
things about greed. For a while,
Dan Quayle's troubles were for
gotten as everyone sighed in re-
lief that Bush had pulled off The
Speech. We repaired to Bourbon

Street and felt bummed that the
convention was over so soon.

AND IN CONCLUSION,
LET ME SAY THIS:

I was surprised to find, by
Friday. that 1 still felt sympav
thetic to the Republican Party.
Before the trip, I half-expected to
be so turned off by what I would
see that I would convert to the
Democrats or become apathetic.
That's not to say I didn't disagree
with much that I heard. I sat
through lots of dumb speeches
If I didn‘t become cynical about
Republicans, and politics in gen-
eral, perhaps it's because of two
aspiring Republican politicians
that I got to know during the
week. I'm speaking of Mike
Tracy, and a young, very politi-
cally-minded girl named Amy
Ellis, from Daingerfield, Texas.
I got to know Amy during the
four evening sessions of the conl
vention that we spent together
listening to the speeches and
watching the delegates Cavort a
couple hundred feet beneath us.
Both she and Mike have high
political aspirations: Amy wants
to be the Governor of Texas (and
she's bright enough), while Mike
wants to be a Representative in
the U.S. House (he's bright
enough, too) I figure, if politics
is good enough for decent, intelr
ligent people like them, then the
least I can do is keep my cynir
cism in check.
