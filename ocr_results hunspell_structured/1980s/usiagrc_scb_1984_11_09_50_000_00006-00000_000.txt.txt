Coach John Pll‘ist ll, ridding.
"They‘ve been tho chnmpions
every year since l'itv bccn
coaching 7 except one i- when
cornell won 7 so it c only was
a big lirst time for us ‘

Plltsch pointed to the unit: as
having a "Great eilect on the
game." explaining. "The wind
caused the game to be so ditllcult
to play that the team pk tog
against the wind was pic-dctei»
mined to play defense

He elaborated. saying. "It
basically came down to kecpiiig
them ironi scoring when [he wind

lieell “10

was with them. and assuming we
could score when we had the
wind." Pflts h described the
game as “c ing and certainly
in doubt all the way" against a
vcr . strong Lake Forest squad.

- there was good play by
everyone in general." iic coin

coalic Jack llartung who "had
very good play and saved a lot oi
goals."

The three Grinnell goals were
tallied by Mark Geniplal‘. Rex

Not only was the season a suc-
ceSsiul one. but Plitsch noted that
the men were only two teams out

the teams selected."

Regardless or not making it to
nationals. the men have a lotto be
proud of. Hitsch reiterated his

Women’s
Cross Country

.Going into conference with a
number one ranking. the Women ’s
Cross Country team hoped to
place accordingly, But it just
wasn't in the cards last weekend
as the women pulled out a second
place tinish with 53 points 7 only
three points out Ol first behind St
Norbert.

"We didn‘t run as well as we
had hoped," commented Coach

velyn Freeman. adding, “It was

bad meet for some individuals
because a lew key people were not
well."

Shavaun Adams won the in-

' ual conierence title With

.14. Other top ﬁnishers {or Grin-
nell included Annette Campbell,
who placed fourth with 20:56. and
Susan Durkee, who was seventh
with 21:30.

Freeman noted, "when healthy.
i clearly could see that we “ere
the best team in the conference,"
adding. “But because of health
problems. some individuals didn‘t
run as well as they could have.
Any other weekend we could have
taken it.”

This weekend provides the
women with one more chance to
show their stuii as they go to
Wartburg [or Kegiunals competi-
tion. "How we do as a team
depends on the health at in
dividuals." noted Freeman.

”Andrea won't be running. and
we'll definitely miss her there."
she remarked on the positive
Side, she stated. "shavaun has a
chance to make Nationals or come
close to it we'll be there hoping
to see her zlkc it."

Football

"Deja v ,thal's how Coach
John Martinek described the
Football Team's \l. in last
weekend. when the Pioneers beat
Illinois College, 20-17. in their final
game oi the season.

lilartinek's opening comment
stems irom the [act that Grinneil
detected lllinois College last year
'n exactly the same way ——.w_ith a

iield goal by Kevin Murphy in the
waning seconds ot the game.

"There were evenshandcd per-
lormances by both offense and
detens commented Martinek.

another tino periormance by a
team that‘s been playing pretty
solid ollense all year long " He
also noted the deiense. led by
Steve Springer and Andy
llamillon, tor playing a "tire.
scrappy ballgame."

record. iilartinek generally is
pleased about the team‘s pin
gress. lie remarked. "i think the
general progression oi the tootbail
program is positive and moving
to its our goal oi playing com
petitive. vtinning toothall.”

"providing leadership both on and
oil the field. adding. ”Without
these men. we wouldn't have gate

Men’s
Cross Country

Finally reaching the climax ol
their season last weekend with the
conference meet. the Men's Cross
Country team exhibited “much
improvement" over its perioi»
mance last year. according to
Coach Will Freeman.

The men placed llfth, as they
did last year. but the times this
year were significantly better
Last year, they were 43 points out
oi iourth place. while this year
they were only ll points out at
iourth and only 26 pomts out oi see
cond

Additional evidence ot the
team's improvement is that tirin-
ncll's filth place finisher this year
ranked 24th overall. while last
years first place finisher. for
Grinnell was 22nd overall Also,
live oi the men this year linlshed
with [aster times than Grinnell's

remarked Freeman. continuing.
"There was a lot oi pressure. and
the guys handled it really well."
Two of the runners. John Abel and
Steve Preus. ran their best times
ever, and John Abel was named
all»conference.

“l was really happy to see John
run well.", commented Freeman.
continuing. "Especially being a
senior and the number three or
four runner on the team all
season. i was glad to see him turn
in a good periormance."

The men's season is technically
over with the exception oi
Regionals this weekend. about
which Freeman is not very con-
cerned. since conference was the
team's ultimate goal. "li’lt'e're 'ust
going to go up there and run. he
stated. "It should be pretty relax
ed I expect they'll run well, but
there's no pressul "

Rellecting on the season.
Freeman noted. “Our goals were
to stay healthy and iimsh well at
conference. and I'm very pleased
that we accomplished both oi
them."

Training room feature

It’s not M.A.S.H., but . . .

by TH Porter

it you've been down to the PEC
tor any length ot time 7 even just
once 7 you're bound to have
noticed an ominous black door at
the end oi that long hallway

well, despite reports to the con-
ti~ai~y, that little room is not a tor»
ture chamber talthough there
have been requests loi‘ a stret-
ching rack on numerous occa-
sioiist. As a matter oi lacl. it
serves Just the opposite purpose 7
making people better

This Space Is commonly called
the training room. and. according
to Coach Martha Rowedder. who
is head trainer Lind in charge oi
the facilities. Its lunction is to
"provide athletes with prevens
tative care, iirst aid, and
rehabilitative care,"

The facilities arc somewhat
limited as training rooms go.
They include icctreatments in the
iorni oi ice bags. ice cups or ice
baths: hot packs; a w irlpool;
and a machine for exercising and

. strengthening ankles

A new leature this year. accor-
ding to howedder. is that. We
have the opportunity to use the
physical therapy tacllitles at the
hospital this year, which include
muscle stimulation and ultra
sound." It an athlete needs such
treatments, Rowedder takes
him/her to the hospital personally
and perlorins the treatments
herself.

who can use the training room ‘2
"We'll take anybody it it's an
emergency." lioviedder remarks
ed. “But our budget only allows
that tape and other supplies be us-
ed for athletes in varsity Sports. ll
othcr teams or individuals pro.
vide the supplies." She noted.
"we'll do the training " The same
holds true {or visiting teams.

Roweddei‘ also nlcnlioncd that
anyone is free to use the ' e and
ankle exerciser and “they can use
the whirlpool and hot packs if the
have a note lrom their doctor 5
ing they need such treatments

This practice may seem a bit
unfair to some. but it is certainly
understandable when you con-
sider that it costs about one dollar

to tape one ankle. and lioiicdder
estimates the cost just tor ankles
to be between is and 2b dollars per ,
day.

She spent $2.0liltal the beginning
oi the year on supplies and is
already having to purchase more
because ot all the tape used so tar.
nowedder estimates that roughly
so inyuries went through the trains
mg room during the fall season

These so or so injuries have
ranged lrom bruises «some
preventing athleles ii-oni practic-
iltgl to sprained ankles to
shoulder problems to a wide
variety oi strains with such a
diverse assortment oi injurles. the
students who work in the training
room need to be knowledgeable
about the diiiercnl types at treat-
ment available.

The Student trainers go through
the athletic training course in
which they learn how to evaluate
the more common types oi iii-
juries sustained in competition.
When it comes to the more
obscure ones, though. that's
iihere ltowcdder's training comes y
in.
Roweddcr's job as head trainer
at Grinnell includes "evaluating
injuries and deCldlng what the
proper care and treatment is. and
teaching and supervising the slur
dent trainers who work down
there." she noted the importance
oi lhesc trainers because “one
pel's can't train alone all season
long. Aside from working in the
training room. the student
trainers are also responsible l'or
providing care tor athletes at all
home games,

An important function oi
Rowedder‘s is deciding whether
injuries are serious enough so that
the athlete “ould need to see a
doctor, ii an injury can be treated
in the training room. it can save
the sludent athlete a lot at time
and expense.

The training room is open every
weekday from 3:30 to 6:30. so the
next time you're over there and
see hordes of people running
around wearing tape . relax ~—
they're just products ot Grinnell's
very own training room.
