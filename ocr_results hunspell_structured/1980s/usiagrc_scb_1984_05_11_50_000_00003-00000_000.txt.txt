arold And Maude

Senior Film:

Harold and Maude. starring Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort, is a wonder
fully funny black comedy. When first released in 1971. it was largely ige
nored by the public and panned by critics. but it has since acquired a cult
following and a general popularity,

Cort stars as Harold. a zdeyear-old with a morbid streak which he exer-
cises by feigning suicides and spectating at funerals. ft is at one of those
funerals that Harold meets Maude (Gordon) who fills the screen as
Harold’s wacky companion in lunacy and love. Vivian Pickles rounds out
the cast as Harold's beleagured mother who masterfully spurts arch
comments about her demented son.

The combination of stylish acting, and imaginative screenplay by Col-
in Higgins and the careful direction of Hall Ashby (director of The Last
Detail) is one that works extremely well. The music by Cat Stevens
makes this excellent movie even better. Harold and Maude is a must~see
for everybody who will be around on senior weekend (and it might even
be worth staying here for).

illle Wonka
And The Chocolate Factory

by Scott Ilildula

Willie Wonk-n am! the L‘hocolale Factory. starring Gene Wilder in one
of his most serious and introspective roles. is a definite must for
chocolate freaks and pure-adolescents to see,

If the title sounds vaguely familiar. it's because this movie was first
released when most of us were in grammer school. (The Ghirradelli
Chocolate Company. which released a special chocolate bar to coincide
with the release of Willie is nothing like the one in the movie. (A real let
down for tenryear old kidsi

The story revolves around a poor little boy and how his life is changed
by a funny little man who owns a chocolate factory but has no family of
his own. When Wonka announces that there is to be a grand tour of the
magical chocolate factory tor the lucky few who find coupons hidden in
candy bars that Wonka's factory sells. there is a mad rush to buy the
winning bars (a sure sale ploy).

As one may guess. Charlie, our little hero, finds one of the coupons and
goes to the factory with his grandpa. While in the factory, oie tour
becomes a test which determines the makeup and mettle of the par-
ticipants. The prize”! Life happily ever after in Wonka‘s wonderland. One
by one the other children disobey Wonka's instructions and come to bad
(7) ends.

Unfortunately Charlie and Grandpa give in to temptation and prove to
be no better than the rest of the tourists. As Wonka was obviously pulling
for little Charlie (the poor kid in the bunch) he ends the tour after the
blunder is discovered,

But what happens to Charlie and Grandpa and the happy ending?
Oompa, Loompa, Doopityrdoo. that‘s nota question I will answer for you,
Boompa, Doompa. Ditty Deedee. the question will answer when the
movie you see.

The Illustrated Man

As he film's title infers, The illustrated Man concerns a chap with a
body Covered with a lot of colorful swirls and pictures. The doodles are
tattoos and the tattooer is a woman, but that's where the reality in the
film ends: these tattoos ain't no ordinary tattoos. and the woman ain’t no
ordinary woman. either.

The tattooee (played by Oscarrrecipient Rod Steiger) is an exearny
roustabout whose body has been thoroughly encased in a mosaic of tat-
toos by the woman illustrator lplayed by Claire Bloom). a creature who
has materialized on Earth out of some far distant future.

Steiger's swirls and pictures differ from most by virtue of the fact that
his are animated and can foretell the future. thus transforming his
epidermis into a onerdimensional cinemtic entity that flashes the
destinies of individuals and the world across its surface,

The gist of The illustrated Mali concerns the meeting between Steiger,
the walking graffiti exhibit. and a young hobo I played by Robert
Drivas). One night, much to the young tramp's astonishment. the pic»
tures on the bndy of the sleeping Steiger come alive and display their
gloomy prophecies. Can the young hobo escape the clutches of destiny
that he has seen foretold on the illustrated man',’ Only time will tell...

The illustrated Man is based on the book by the same title by sci-fi big
wig Ray Bradbury. whose tales of the bizarre are almost sure to raise
