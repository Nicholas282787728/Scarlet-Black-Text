Not to be missed, Van Ness show closes Wednesday

by Caty C. Forden

If you have not yet visited
the Print Study Room this fall,
make sure you don't miss the ex-
hibition of paintings by Beatrice
Whitney Van Ness Lhat hangs
there until Nov. 9. This Show
of portraits and landscapes, done
mainly in oil paint but also in
watercolor, traces the artist's de-
velopment from the early 1900's
up until her death in ESL Al-
though her style changes noticc-
ably from her early years as a
student at the Museum of Fine
Arts in Boston, Van Ness
consistently explores the possir
bilities of color, shape, and mo-
tion in her portraits (mainly of
women and children) and her
landscapes.

Several of her early paint»
ings reﬂect an academic and stu-
dious approach to ponrait paintr
ing. For example, in Woman in
Black (1922) the Woman fills the
entire picture frame, creating a
closed space that allows only for
a subdued background. Her range
of colors remains generally re-
strained. and we are made very
much aware of the pose.

In later works however, we
see a change in Van Ness's ap-
proach to portraiture. She ex-
pands her color range (or palette)
and manipulates the composition
to open up the space around the
ﬁgure, paying closer attention to
the interaction of the background
space with the ﬁgure, As a result
we get more ofa feeling of who
these people are by the environ»
ment they occupy, For example,
in The Evening Transcript (1916)
a man turns partially out toward
me viewer as he sits reading the
newspaper. His action, looking

out, and the opposing angle at
the paper add depth and move-
ment. Van Ness divides up the
space with a window in back and
a sweep of a curtain. Reds and
greens repeat and interlock the

space with the figure. in the
foreground, the back of a chair
and a stack of books also help to
frame the ﬁgure in a believable
environment The motion created
by the repetition of shapes and
color reinforces the momentary
quality of the scene as the man
looks away brieﬂy from the pa-
per,

Similarly, Girl in Riding
Habit (1922) displays Van
Ness's use of windows to open
up space and exemplifies her
loose brushstyle. A young
woman in riding habit stands in

front of a window through which
the outside blues, greens and
whites seem to dance around her,
suggestive of her ride outside,
We appreciate Van Ness's gestu-
ral brush strokes, evident espe-
cially in the woman's hand which
appears as ﬂashes of color, as
well as her more polished han»
dling of the facial features,

A much later oil painling,
Summer Sunlight (1936), per
haps testiﬁes best to the artist's
individual color style, her atten—
tion to shapes, and her interest in
the effects of light. Three
women gather under an umbrella,
as the beach and sea stretch out in
the distance Unlike in her earlier
portraits, the figures capture our
attention in the shapes they form
as they interact with each other
and the environment. Bright
yellows, oranges, reds, and greens
vibrate with an intensity achieved
by a thick layering of different
tones. We cannot help enjoying.
along with Van Ness, the cool
shadows under the umbrella and

the brightness and sultry heat of '

the beach.

Van Ness devotes several of
her landscapes to this enjoyment
of the sea. Perhaps the open.
endless quality of the sea encour-
aged her to manipulate her brush
and palette more freely. In
Ogunquit Beach Scene (1913»
15), bold, thick brush strokes
capture the gestures of people
dotting a beach. We can sense
the wind as the artist deftly
records her momentary impres-
sions.

This exhibition of oil
paintings and watercolors by an
early 20th century American
painter deserves a careful viewing
to fully experience Van Ness's
love of color, shape, and the
brushstroke. The show is on
View in the Print Study Room in
the lower level of Burling Library
until November 9. The Print
Study Room is open 1 to 5 pm,
Sunday through Friday.

backwards, but it must be lived
lorwards," the book moves back-

lives, tracing the experiences that

a Los Angeles Times reviewer as
"an intricately reflective; simply
beautiful book," First Light has

'been termed "a rare achievement"

and "a wonderful work" by critics
and other contemporary writers.
