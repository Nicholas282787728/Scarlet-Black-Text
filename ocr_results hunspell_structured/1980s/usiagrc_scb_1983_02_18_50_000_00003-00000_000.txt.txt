Most of us have purchased Michelin
Guidebooks at one time or another to aid
us in discovering the architectural and
historic wonders of unfamiliar places.
However, inexplicably, the famed
Michelin voyagers have neglected to in-
clude Grinnell on their intinerary,
(Perhaps news of some of our less than
sensational structures has already come
their way.) Dospite certain architectural
blunders, however, Grinnell’s campus has
several outstanding buildings of historical
importance. Thus, where Michelin failed,
the Scarlet and Black will succeed with the
following authentic walking tour of art and
architecture on the Grinnell College

campus.

Goodnow Hall: Built in 1385 in honor of
the marriage of Mary Grinnell and David
0. Mears, Goodnow was originally a
“libraryvobservatory”. The hall is
Romanesque in style and was built to
withstand the many tornados and storms
which have plagued other college
buildings. The oldest building on campus,
Goodnow still had dirt floors until the
Psychology Department renovated the
hall decades after its construction. Good-
now is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places.

Herrick Chapel: An example of perpen-
dicular Gothic architecture characterized
by angular lines, Herrick was built in 1906.
The original plans for the chapel included

 

 

Musical notes

Saturday, 9:30 p.m., North Lounge

Though neither Jamaicans nor
Rastafarians, the members of Dallol comr
bine to play some of the finest and most
propulsive reggae today. From Ethiopia,
where the roots of reggae are said to have
first appeared, Dallol has shaped tradi-
tional reggae into exciting music with a
tight beat and an emphasis on the bass
line.

With expert {our-voice harmony and a
“jubilant spirit," this band has put out
several excellent singles, their most re-
cent of which was produced by Rim
Marley.

In addition to their extensive reggae
repertoire, the band features authentic
African music and traditional Ethiopian
numbers which are characterized by quick
tempos and unusual rhythmic patterns.

The Bookcase

by Bob Kleine

“A good book, a spot or sherry and a
glowing fire a this is as close to heaven as
a mere mortal shall ever come,"

Here’s this week’s list of Grinnell prots’
favorites:

Professor John M. Mohan, Department at
Russian:

1. a Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,
Joyce

2. The Seven Storey Mountain. Merton

3. The Immense Journey, Loren Eiseley
4. The Once and Future King. white

5. Charles Dickens: uis Tragedy and
Triumph, Johnson

Professor Daniel Gross, Department of
French:

however these additions later proved too
costly.

Carnegie Hall: Built with funds donated
by Andrew Carnegie (his first donation to
a private institution), Grinnell‘s Carnegie
Hall is modified classical, or “Carnegie
Classical" in style. The frieze of Carnegie
is especially interesting with the names of
major contributors to Western culture
carved in its stone.

Alumni Recitation Hall: A modified
Georgian structure with some Gothic
features, ARH is notable for its decorated
arches with heraldic shields, ileurs-de-lys
and gargoyles.

Dormitories: Most of the college’s dor-
mitories were built in the “collegiate
Gothic style” patterned after Oxford and
Cambridge. The enclosed lnggia on South
Campus was built to shield its female (and
therefore more “delicate") residents from
the cold. In addition, the church-like styl-
ing of Quad is said to have been chosen in
order to instill a sense of virtue on its lady
diners.

Darby: Described as Grinnell's “only
experiment in Art~Deco,” Darby is an ar
chitectural wonder because its domed ceil-
ing was built entirely of wood, due to shor-
tages in other materials caused by World
War ll.

The Forum: ike Burling and Fine Arts,
the Forum is an “international" style
building which emphasizes clean, simple
lines and the visibility of its structural
features, Despite its two-story construc-
tion, the Forum is actually composed of
seven different levels. _

Inside the Forum: Both of Grinnell's art
galleries are located in the Forum. The
Negative Space Gallery was designed to
display recent works oi college students.
The gallery changes weekly. The Terrace
Gallery, also in the basement of the
Forum, circulates articles from the col»
lege’s permanent art collection. The ex»
hibits in this gallery change every six
weeks.

DlVCl‘SlOHS—

 

Love and Death ~— (1975. 39 min.)

Dmcribed by The New Yorker as “im
perially funny,“ Love and Death is a
Woody Allen rendition of War and Peace.
Allen plays Boris, a reluctant draftee in
the Russian Army during the Napoleonic
Wars who tells his life story through the
use of narration and flashbacks.

Diane Keaton plays Sonja, an “idyllic
beauty" who shares Boris‘ fascination
with the epistemological world. (indeed,
even the word ”epistemological" is
fascinating to them.) Through the film, the
two attempt to find answers to their ques-
tions about (guess what?) the nature of
love and death.

The first film in which Woody Allen
begins to move away from his overtly
slapstick comedy style to a subtle and
summow serene brand of humor, Love and
Death is consistently funny and this week’s
best choice.

The Great Santilli — (1950. 118 min.)

A story at an American family in 1962,
The Great Santini confroan such timely
issues as militarism discipline and racism.

The film stars Robert Duvall as Bull
Meechum, sewing as a lieutenant colonel
in the Marine Corps during a time when
the United States is not involved in any
major war.

Meechum is a military psychopath, and
his approach to discipline typifies his hard
line mentality. Competitive, even with his
own son (expertly played by Michael
O'Keefe), Meechum’s coldness threatens
to destroy his lamily.

While meaningful, this film has a
tendency to divide people into ‘us" (the
good guys and the audience) and “them"
(the militarists and rednecks which the
movie features).

The Great Suntini is, nonetheless, an in—
teresting film which offers a view of an
American lamily in times past.

Das Boot

0f the more than 40,000 U-boat sailors
pressed into service in World War ll, less
than 10,000 survived.

Das Boot winner of two prestigious Ger-
man film awards, is the story 01 42 raw
German naval recruits caught up in a war
they did not understand.

Director Wolfgang Petersen’s adventure
epic, an “unsanitized portrait of the
claustrophobic struggle" of submarine
sailors is a rarity, a war film that makes a
universal antiwar statement.

This film is one of the finest of the
semester and should be seen at all costs.
