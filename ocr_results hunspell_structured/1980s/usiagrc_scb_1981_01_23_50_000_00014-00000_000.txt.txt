Exploring The New Right

_ Last November, the majority in the
Senate changed hands for the first time
n_2s years, This event has been inter
'preted by many analysts as a
manilestation and result of a conserr
ative trend within the electorate. l

rustration and anger that surfaced
,there as a result of the election. Com-
unding the anxiety over the nevt and

My intention in this and the following essays

with no central locus or goal
Therel'ore. an introspection into
liberalism is essential to the creation oi
a strong liberal policy platlorm

The introspection necessary is not in-
to the problems themselves. at least not
initially. but into the unsatislactory
structure at current liberalism. Once it
new structure is provided then each
problem can be systematically ap.
proached with an eye to the ultimate
goal mandated by the assumptions

is to examine these premises and the

policy directions which logically follow.

was the continual prediction that the
Democratic Party would have to
change its perspective to reflect this
nevi conservatism.

This is a hard pill tor a moderate to

liberal Democrat to swallow I do not
believe tat a conservative shlit is
necessarily a prerequisite to political or
sDCietal success. However. 1 do feel that
the electorate has given the
Democratic Party a much needed op
portunity to review the policies which
they have espoused, oltcn in knee-yerk
l'ashion. More importantly. the liberal
and moderate coalition. \«ho no“ finds
itscli removed irom policy making
positions, has the chance to examine
the premises which term the loundation
at its liberalism.
; This reexamination is more imparr
tant' than an investigation oi the
methods oi‘ the New Right. Ultimately.
liberalism will have to take the in-
iti tive by producing a policy platlorm
which is grounded in progressivism and
can be seen by the bulk of the electorate
to be efficable. Only then can liberals
hope to securely regain the seat oi
power which they l'ormerly held.

My intention in this and the iollowing
essays is to examine these premises
and the policy directions which logical-
ly iollow We do not examine only the
policies because the habit‘ ol
reevaluating programs \‘iltl’loul
reevaluating the underlying premises
is dangerous. It oiten leads. as Vie savy

which base the structures. These most
basic assumptions are those which he
consider the basic rights oi all
members at our society.

Thomas Jellerson perhaps best
phrased the basic rights at all human
beings as "lite, liberty and the pursuit
oi happiness: implicii in this phrase is
the condition that the pursuit by one
party not inlringe on the same basic
rights oi any other person. However.
the lull attainment oi this goal is im»
possible in a world at ﬁnite resources.
This, then. lorms the justliicdlion lor
political society — to decide and en
force the limits to which any person or
people can infringe on the rights oi
others in the society. The secondary
purpose at the political society is to pro-
tect its members lrom others. not part
oi that society. lrom infringing on the
rights or the society as a \vhole.

Limiting our discussion oi the strucr
ture and policies which can logically
lollovy irom this premise are a levy cor»
rellaries. Most important is that we
realize that hypocrisy and contradic—
tion are impossible to eliminate, Knolv
ing this we wish to limit the contradics
tions that do arise because they create
weakness in the philosophical struce
ture. Therefore, when a contradiction
arises we must be able to point to the
current circumstances which, in turn,
justiiy our choice at path in resolving
the dilemma. Our second rule is,
therefore, that each of the paths we
choose must be taken because of our
perception oi the present, even if this

means abandoning a current policy
position in iavor oi one which more ac»
curately reilecis the changed nature oi
the surrounding circumstances. The
Wisdom of flexibility follow from this
rule as does the responsib ty to con-
stantly reevaluate the world around us
and the degree to which our policies and
their underlying inundation still mesh
with those realities.

We have no“ come lull circle. as he
have arrived at the poiiii at which we
began: reevaluating the loundution oi
liberal policy in light at the present c
cumstances. Une task remains to be a

The governmental mechanisms
vihich distribute the \iedlih ol the socie-
ty are direct results oi the economic
system \yhich the society either chooses
or inherits. As our society operates in a
capitalistic system. loosely delined. no
need only concern ourselves with this
system. Those Who viould compldln that
this choice discards other possible
systems. namely the socialist alter
native, are not rellecting the present
realities.

The premise ol capitalism is that the
tree market system provides the most
eliicient distribution ol a society s
wealth and vilth vieulth the ability to
pursue happiness. Again. realities show
that we do not operate with it tree
