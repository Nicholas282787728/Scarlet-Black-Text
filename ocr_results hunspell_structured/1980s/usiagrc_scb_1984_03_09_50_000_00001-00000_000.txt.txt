By Ellen Z. Piekalkiewicl

The turnout was good Monday
night in South Lounge tor the an
nual SGA presidential debates.
The six candidates spoke on
various issues and agreed more
often than not on the importance
of these issues. but disagreed on
Specific strategies.

Each candidate made brief
opening remarks laying out their
basic political philosophy collcer~
ning SGA.

Matt Golden, who was first to
speak. said, he would like to see
“SGA solicit students’ opinions in
order to encourage
participation.”

Ethan Cohen. deriding SGA's
current relationship with the ad

ministration said. “It tthe rela-
tionshipl isn’t good for the
students!”

David Kopelman said he ants
more “efficiency in SGA and
tools this can be accomplished by
increasing the number or comm
tees. Kopelman. in addition. ad-
dressed the criticism that he is too
politically leit saying, “I have
deliberately brought the conserr
vatlves out oi the closet. lam not
a pseudo-liberal. I learn irom tlle
leit and the right.”

Todd Coutter advocated a “rec
locus and redirection oi SGA”

Joint board passes
‘EPC resolution

by Peter Small

A number of issues were
discussed at the SGA meeting last
Wednesday. One oi the evening‘s
highlights was the passage or a
resolution recommending that
Educational Policy Committees
\EPCs) set up some sort oi
system to replace the now aban-
doned class evaluations.

Discussion over whether to ap-
prove a resolution encouraging
EPC members to establish some
sort or class evaluation system
was prompted by a letter sent by
Wes Joe. head or the history EPC
and Andrew Reeves, chair of the
Religious Studies EPC, The
authors of the letter reminded the
SGA that they have no power over
the EFCs and that any resolution
passed by the SGA would be non
binding. Joe and Reeves {urn-lei"
stated that the results of EPC
sponsored evaluations would not
be worth the time or the expense
incurred.

Anne Stein stated that the

lttru

nationalist Tamara Berger und Pulesi

resolution is only intended to be a
suggestion to the EPCs she lur-
ther stated that as chairperson oi
the political science EPC she
thinks that having the EPC do
evaluations is a worthwhile idea,
In response to Joe's comment that
the evaluations would take upa lot
of time she said “Sure, they‘re
time consuming. . .but so whatl”,

Robbie Sckalor, SGA treasurer
and chairperson of the humanities
EPC. also supports the idea. He
believes that the resolution should
be seen simply as a reilection oi
the opinion oi the SGA, He sug
gested that the SGA send
guidelines [or EPC evaluations to
the curriculum committee so that
the proposal will seem less vague.

Mary Kosmidis said that pro
lessors should be encouraged to
help in the creation or an evalua-
tion system. it was also pointed
out that new professors often ﬁnd
evaluations helpiul in making
changes in their courses. The
resolution was passed.

amount of time”. because he
knows the system. He added he
“will push SGA to do something.”

Speaking last. Jlm Scott sai
”SGA can represent student opi»
nion". explaining, “CsP should
petition students outside of the
dining halls once a month on their
opinions on the issues," Scott also
called tor a continuation of the
tradition oi having a keg every
other week outside of the SGA oi"
lice. He said, “It is a great idea
ior people to get to know who is in
SGA."

After their initial statements
the candidates ﬁelded questions
from the audience and the debate
began only to be delayed ior 15
minutes by a fire alarm set off by
a prankster. according to Forum
Desk Attendant Joanne Buck.

The debate continued after the
interruption. The main issue oi
the evening was SGA's involve
ment in national and international
politics,

Coulter. the only Candidate ex»
pressing disagreement with
sons current practice oi making
political Statements. snid instead,
“SGA should encourage student
debate and student education”.
adding, “SGA can provide the
forum for students to educate
themselves on the issues."

Another debated question was
SGA’s relationship with the ad-

ministration. Stein. stating he has

dealt with the college administra
tion in a “controlled manner".
said, “Our relationship with the
administration is more onessided
than it has to be. because we are
not organized."

Kopelman said, “I would like to
see more interaction between the
administration and students and
not only when there is some big
controversial issue."

Cohen in direct opposition said.
“We should disrupt the tranquil
life of Grinnell College ad-
ministrators.” He added, “This is
how we can get things done. We
have amazing power that hasn't
been utilized.”

In reierence to the security
lorce issue. Scott said he “would
scrap the iorce and then 31200
would be tree to put into a
Women's Resource Center g
something that is really needed.”

Stein on the same subycct said.
“ll the administration wants a
security iorce then let them
manage it."

Golden in response said
realistically the security force is
probably here to stay. so he adr
vocates ”trying to work out some
iinancc agreement with the ad
ministration.”

The candidates were asked
speciiically about their opinions

Kopelman said, “It is reprehens
sible tor us to be getting money
from South Africa even it it is in
directly." and recommended a
speciiic plan oi action 7 “I would
suggest each member oi the South
Airican Support Group write 5 let-
tcrs once every three weeks to the
administration concerning this
issue , . , It would be a pain for the
administration to open and read
that many letters.” he said.
Kopelman said he would also ask
the SGA to Write these letters,

The expensive book prices at
the college bookstore was also
discussed. Coulter said he would
like SGA to “start a student thrift
shop to sell used books and [ur-
niture throughout the year." say-
ing it would “provide a low cam-
pus jobs. money ior SGA, and
would be a good student service,"

Golden responded that he
thought this suggestion was
unrealistic and didn't take into ac-
count thc costs and respon-
sibilities that would be‘lnvolved.

Cohen said. “On an experimenr
ta] basis SGA should buy the most
expensive books tindependently
of the bookstore) and then sell
them to the students at lower
rates,”

Golden said he lavors more
partnership with the administra
tion and thus would like to see a
“coup bookstore” as a solution.

0n core curriculum Cohen said.
“maybe it‘s not such a big issue
because as long as faculty posis
tions are in jeopardy there won‘t
be a change,"

Coulter said. however. “We
don’t want to get apathetic about
all of this. . , We have to do
something about this before it
happens."

Israeli and Palestinian nationalists
concur at presentation

by Elliot Spagat

When a Palestinian nationalist
and an Israeli nationalist get
together to discuss issues, you
might expect a fiery debate.

However. when Palestinian na»
tionist Rita Giacaman and Israeli
nationalist Tamara Berger spoke
to a Forum crowd this past Tues-
day at 4:15 pm, a similar
message was conveyed. The
dialogue, sponsored by the Rosen»
field Public Affairs Program and
titled “Perspectives on Peace,“
called for a mutual understan~
ding,

The most plausible solution to
many Mideast problems, accorr
ding to both speakers. lies in
creating an independent Palestir
nlan state bordering Israel. This
means a return to the boundaries
prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.

Both speakers agreed that the
American public is grossly mism-
Iormed on the Middle East situa
tion. The women are in the US to
persuade Americans‘oi the need
tor change in US. iorcign policy.

East. Berger criticized the
American government for giving
arms instead oi badly needed
social assistance. Berger asserted
that Israel is today totally depen—
dent economically and politically
on the United States. Consequent»
1y, important israeli policy deci-
sions are made by the its.
government without the consent
oi the lsraeli people,

Giacaman, who feels us,
ioreign policy is crucial to
Mideast peace, posited that the
United States should not feel they
can solve the Palestinian
statehood problem memselves.
The Reagan Plan, which calls for
Palestinian migration to another
Arabic state, and the American
involvement in Lebanon indicate
a “miscalculation” of world at-
fairs. she said. She suggested
negotiations with all nations in-
volved. including the U.S., the
U,S.S.R., Syria, and the P.L.O.

Berger emphasized that lsraeli
society is not as Western and
democratic'as it is alleged to .be.

schools and hospitals continually

shutting down. and a high iniant
mortality rate, the lsraeli govern
ment spends about 50 percent oi
its revenue on developing its
military.

This. according to Berger. is
catastrophic. “Israeli citizens are
led to believe that using force and
power is the only way to survive.”
she said. However. she was op
timistic in noting that since the
1973 Yam Kippur War.
mainstream Israeli society is his
creasingly questioning Israel’s
righteousness in military attairs.

Both admitted that creating a
Palestinian state existing side by
side with lsrael will be difficult to
realize. Berger felt that the
absence or a women s movement
and a grass roots peace move-
ment is one reason {or their lack
oi support. Giacaman told the au
dience that most Palestinians
would rather be treated equally
within Israel than try to establish
independence “The average
Palestinian's dream is to live in a
nonssectarian, secular state when

.Jews. Moslems and Arabs'can
'live together peaceiuily.
