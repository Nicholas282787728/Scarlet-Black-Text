Inequality in funding
of softball

by M alle ['ullslalll . g

The soltball team has seven operating
halls lor use in their one pitching machine;
the baseball team has close to thirty balls
tor use in their two pitching machines The
disparity between these two sports, “cams
parable sports" according to House.
Education and Weltare rules. is great but
it is lessening.

John Pfitsch. the Grinnell College
Athletic Director stated. There's no ques-
tion about the disparity. We try to put out a
program which is representative oi what
other schools do, Our women's soitball
program is relatively comparable tto
baseballi but not equal in money spent and
equipment "

This year's budget [or baseball is $2,372
as campared to $1,777 [or soltball. This
breaks down to $1.200 versus ssst tor
equipment/supplies. soon versus $550 tor
umpires and 51.072 versus $676 tor travel,
in all categories except tor ollicials. the
baseball budget is greater than the soitball
budget

There are 2224 players out tor baseball
this year and 1922 players out tor soitball.

Sandy Sorellsen. a senior member ot the
soltball team said. “sottball is not a priori-
ty ttoi- the collegel. To me it seems
ridiculous that they can't allocate more
money. There are never enough balls, We
always have to he shuttled irom place to
place to practice and the held is in bad

shape." cont. to page 14
