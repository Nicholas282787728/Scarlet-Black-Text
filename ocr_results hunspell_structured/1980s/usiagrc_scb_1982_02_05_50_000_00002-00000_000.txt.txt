declined to be identified.

Because or this. the college Films Com-

students and even one academic departr

Thus it was generally tell that even though
acqurring the picture was a relatively ex-
pensive proposition. it would be well worth

fun with the movie. After the movie had
ended. the auditorium in ARH was a mess
and the movle screen had a large rip in its
center. caused by a beer bottle which had
been hurled at It by a reckless viewer

"Friday alter the movie. i went down to
check the initial rip." said Films Chairper-
son Laura Bradley. "and people were
throwing things at me! I turned around
and said something like 'haven‘t you
thrown enough.’ but they kept throwing
things!"

When questioned about the showing oi
the film by faculty members at their Feb. 1
meeting. Dean of Students Jim Tedermari
reported. “it took nine hours or labor to
clean up" lollowing Friday‘s pertora

ty rowdy behavior."

on Saturday. Bradley. Performing Pro»
grams and Activities Counselor Georgia
Dentel and Projectionist Tom Spackman
had a meeting to decide whether or not to
Show the film again that evening.
Spackman said. ”We decided to show it
again on Saturday because we felt that ii
the students realized the value of the
screen. they would show some considera

tion "

That afternoon. Bradley had KDIC ans
nounce that the movie would be shown
again but the screen was in lragile shape
and the ﬁlm would be shut off at the first
sign or objects being thrown at it
Spackman repeated this message beloi-c
the film's second showing. emphasizing
that the Screen was Worth between 34.000
to 35.000

The Saturday crowd as a whole. accoi»

stupidity were 01 an extreme nature.

Spackman stopped the movie shortly

at the auditorium.

One student from Grinnell High School
has stepped forward with information cons

he requested his name be withheld he is in
touch with Dean of Student Allan‘s Jim
Tederman

The youth said several students iroin the
high school were in the front rows of the
auditorium Among them he claims he saw
a male student throw at least one roll of
toilet paper at the screen but that it did no
damage However. the description ol the
culprit who threw the telling shot {its that

Both Bradley and Spackman expressed
great disgust and disappointment regar-
ding the gross immaturity on the part or
many of the students. "i think that there
are some students here who really show no
consideration ior anything that isn't
theirs." commented Bradley. "I've spoken

Land that it's a privilege to get to see

don't seem to appreciate it."

Spackman added. "rt-e heard people
saying in the past that they didn't like go
ing to see movtes in Anli anymore.
because the audience was often too rude or
obnoxious; this. of course. makes it dti'
licult to appreciate what is on the screen.
What happened with liucky llrii-i-ni- was
just an extreme example or this "

All this is regrettable. since Films Com-
mittee members believe they have been
trying to improve the quality or the film
programming for the college in the past
few years, including improvements regarr
ding visual and sound quality.

Tederman also told the laculty Monday.
"that the showing or the movie slipped

ed it was being played. he said. he would
have thought about cancelling it. as "some
other campuses have "

At present. it is hoped. the gashed screen
will be taped together in some manner
which may or may not prove successful At
best. the screen will have an obvious strip
across the middle. which will impair the
vtewmg experience oi the audience. lt is
unknown how soon the present screen can
be replaced. Years ago. a screen was vane
dalized in ARH. and the students had to
learn to live with a gashed screen tor quite
some time. "Apparently." said an
anonymous member oithe administration.
"that incident wasn‘t enough to teach the
students that something like a movie
screen is a piece of equipment to be
respected and protected ' ‘

SGA Vice»President 'l'erri Gould told the
shit that SGA members met Tuesday wtth
Tederman to discuss the incident. It was
decided that SGA would release a state
ment to the campus this week and wait ror
reaction to it belore taking any action
"The SGA will probably have to pay for it
la new screen l.' ’aid Gould. "because the
administration won't.”

in general. most students lcelings
regarding the incident can be summed up
by the thoughts or one particularly sar-
donic Grinnelllan who felt. "The ’Saturday
