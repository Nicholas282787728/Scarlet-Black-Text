Cross Country

20th in

by Grant Ehrlich

This weekend. on their home
course, the men’s crosscountry
team placed a strong second in the
Les Duke lnvrtational, a mere
three points behind Simpson Col
lege, Because ol their commanr
ding perrormance and promising
capabilities Grinnell was ranked
ZDlh in the nation by the NCAA
Division 111 coaches poll

The key to this meet was packs
ing, which the Purple R005 nearly
perfected. Their desire to pack was
inspired by a favorite Gandhiism
which appeared on their bulletin
board under the heading
“Rooshil” "Full effort is full vic-
tory." White Evans, the Missing
Link, and Hair Express Hammond
rode the magic carpet vying for top
honors, Mark “Living Room"
Couch and Sweet Steve Piper (ormr
ed the pack of destiny.

the pack tor a while, then ivan

The strategy worked well for the
Roos, so well that they placed live
runners in the top is, Realize that
the dittcrence between our boys
and Simpson Saturday was about
two seconds. over a livermile
course, and that ain't much Take
into consideratoin that only 130
runners were in Saturday's race.
and when you put the team into one
oi the bigger races, we look even
better, explained Coach Freeman
Now consider that the team did not
run last year's two top lreshmen.
Kent “Iowa Boy” Koth, and
Jonathan Lave, heck. God knows
where these R005 are headed.

The next event w|ll be this up
coming Saturday when the team
travels to Beloit tor the Beloll lns
vitaiional. This will be a lowrkey
meet; Belml is best known lor their
showers. thus the team will train -,
hard this week, allowing no i
recovery tor the race, Once again
they will be driven by words ol
destiny. as Jose Ortega y cassett
told them, ”Effort is only eilort
when it begins to hurt," but then
again, "When you win, nothing
hurts" the Namatht.

So what is all this training and
hard work for" On the record it is
tor Regionals and maybe Na-
tionals, but it you ask a Purple
R00, that is not quite what he will
say. He will say, "It is tor Pele,"
Pete Kissanc, their assistant coach
who is winning the race against il»
lness Scott hamilton had one thing
to say- “We iust wanted to kick a
little ass tor Pete." So that is just
what they did

Now that the excitement and the
frenzy oi the Beyond Feathers and
Tepees Symposium has laded, it is
time to turn our attention to
another socially weighty issue. The
home opener lor our lootball game
is this Saturday. How shall we
prepare? Perhaps there should be
a Roseniield Symposium entitled
"Beyond Helmets and Pigskins.”
Perhaps SGA should have an in-
itiative protesting Grinnell's in
volvement in the NCAA. There are
many ways to approach this dilem-
ma. all or which I will ignore.

The lootball team is playing its
iii-st home game alter two games

occurrence would be cause tor a
Homecoming Celebration. But who
wants to celebrate coming home to
Gl'innell? The game starts at 1:30
