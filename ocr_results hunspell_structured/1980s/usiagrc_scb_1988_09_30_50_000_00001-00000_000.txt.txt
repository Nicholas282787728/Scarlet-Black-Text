Crady issues warning on campus thefts

by Anju 0001

Though Grinnell is a rela-
tively safe small community,
thefts do occur. This year is no
exception. To date, items
ranging from laundry detergent to
somewhere between 80 and 100
dollars in cash from a student's
room have been stolen. Bikes,
locked and unlocked, and
backpacks continue to be "high
danger" items, said Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Tom Crady. People
frequently take backpacks in
hopes of ﬁnding cash, cameras,
or other valuables. Thefts of
high value items, such as cars,
stereos, and personal computers
still remain rare occurrences on
campus.

Crady is uncertain whelher
students or townspeople are re
sponible for the majority of
campus‘thefts. According to his
past experience, the most thefts
are committed by adults who are

a few years out of high school.
They tend to operate individually
rather Lhan in groups.

Vacations are one of the most
common times for thefts to
occur. It is during this time that
students leave their personal
possessions unguarded during the

moving process. Another com
mon theft time is at 3 a,m..
when most people are asleep and
unsuspecting. However, thefts
can occur "any time the loggias
aren't populated," said Crady.
During these times, there are
usually very few witnesses,

"School Daze" in ARH

compasses the idea of learning to
acknowledge and to accept the
differences among our people as
well as lng pride in our rich
heritage," wrote Jodi Hester, cx-
panding on the Black Awareness
Week's theme. "Black Awareness
Week attempts to share with the
Grinnell Community our pride
and our identity and the celebra-
tion of black students."

Hester hopes that Black
Awareness Week will serve to
"make people more aware. It's so
easy as minorities to get swal-
lowed up by the mainstream. We
want to focus on the history and
heritage of black people."

Unlike Black History Month,
Black Awareness Week occurs
only on Grinnell's campus.
Black History Month is nlltlunr
ally known and celebrated all over
the country.

All activities scheduled for
the week are open to everyone on
campus. Social as well as cul-
tural events are planned.

 

Because of this, most thieves are
notapprchcndcd

Crady strongly urges robbed
students to report all thefts
promptly, He said that "even the
smallest things" should be re—
rcsident adviser or nightwatchman
should be contacted if the theft
occurs during the night. Student
Affairs will talk to the robbed
student and will request that the
Grinnell Police Department be
called. This is especially
important if a townsperson is
suspected of the crime. If the
thief is caught, the robbed student
can determine the measures that
will be taken. If the thief is a
student, the victim may take the
student to the Judicial Council or
to the President's Hearing Board,
depending on the severity of the
crime. The sentence could be
suspension or dismissal. In
situations where a person causes

extensive damage to school
property, such as vandalizing a
building or stealing a computer,
the school "reserve[s] the right of
pressing criminal charges.” said
Crady.

A student’s personal property
may or may not be covered under
his or her family's homeowner‘s
policy. For those not covered,
local insurance agencies provide
coverage for individual looms.

The school enforces prolccr
tion from theft by locking and
securing all dormitory doors at
night, and by employing night-
watchmen to patrol the campus
from 4 pm. to 8 am. Besides
the obvious precautions of look-
ing room doors and bikes at all
times, Crady advises students not
to prop hall doors open and to
report all suspicious events or
people to the nightwatchmcn or
the Grinnell Police Department.
