DAMION AND ME (Part II)

Michael T. and me go wandering
'Bout, breakin’ headlights and
Shooting at dogs.

Adolescence

Farewell fond dream
Time to taper crazy yearnings
perhaps my mother
is not as foolish as I thought
' Perhaps my lather

Finally come the rains and the
Black turns wet and greasy.
We slide from street to street
Merging with the sidewalks and
Concrete pa‘ve.

—Andrew Reeves

Cinderella

everyone tells me
my time will come
when

why can't it be ﬂaw

is it right

to bring a little girl up
on stories

of handsome princes

in which everyone
lives happily ever after

it isn’t fair
what happens
when she finds out

the slipper doesn’t fit

—Christine Wagner

Haiku

The moon covering
Her shy countenance in an
Airy veil of clouds.

>E|izabeth M. deCraw

thinks as often as I do
Could be true

lint i doubt it.

Hello new dream.

—Eugene Gant

Skin Iron

Skin Iron stands erect
at his fast lie the broken frames of the woman
he has touched.

At night he crawls into
unsuspecting arms

and presses his cold hard body
against the warmth of the bed.
His kisses freeze the silence.
His tongue, digging

between the legs of womanhood.
searches for a new alloy.

His body pummeling rivets Into
the ﬂesh of virtue,

is insatiable

Young breasts reﬂected in his eyes
are sent spinning into the fathoms of concrete and rust
soldered to the remains of Wall Street and then some.

Skin Iron climbs the scaffold naked.
His presence shakes the ground,
but the steel holds him.

He eats the metal.

He remembers for the ﬁrst time
a girl.

He touched her face

and the cold of his hands

made her blind,

the blue of her eyes frozen

upon the last gaze of his face.

He feels his neck tightening, he is being choked
by his own blood.
He did not know he had any.
— Kate Voorsanger
