Clark accuses Reagan of alienating Third World

Cites education in us. as one reason for ignorance about African affairs

by Frank Cromwell

Former Senator Dick Clark (Drlowa)
has been on and around campus tor the
last two weeks. primarily engaged in
teaching his course concerning US rela-
tions with Airica. He has also given talks
on divestment in South Airica and the
perils oi the nuclear arms race.

Clark. whose term ran irom 1973779, also
served on a congressional subcommittee
on African aiiairs. His main concern was
Southern Airica He visited such countries
as Malawi, Botswana, Zambia and the
Republic oi South Airica

His Course, which ends today, concen
trated on US relations wiui Southern
Africa and dealt with such issues as Zim-
babwe and its role since independence;
Namibia's light for independence from
South Africa; the Angolan Civil War and
what role Congress played and the whole

question of South Airica concerning the
role oi black opposition to the white
supremacist government.

When asked what motivated him to
teach the course, Clark cited a chance to
organize and collect his thoughts on
Southern Africa, as well as a iondness for
Grinnell. (His son, Tom Clark, is a senior J

Clark believes that the main problem
area in Airica today is vvithout a doubt the
Republic at South Airica. He went on to
say. that President Ronald Reagan‘s pre-
sent policy oi “cozying up" to the racist
government is extremely harmiul to us.
toreign policy, since it is alienating the
rest or the Third World He was dismayed
by the tact that while the other 51 Airican
nations are united in their opposition to the
government, the United States continues
to support it. Clark iavors immediate

divestment in South Atrica, to be iollowed
by a trade embargo and perhaps a
severance oi diplomatic ties ii the situa-
tion remains unchanged,

Clark then expounded on the role oi
Airica in today's world. He explained that
Africa has great importance and must not
be taken lightly, due to the iact that it real-
ly is the center of the Third World. On the
whole, he said, ”Africa has the greatest
potential and the greatest problems.” The
potential ls stored in the continent's Vast
mineral wealth but there are many pro~
blems in excavating and developing these
minerals, Development in general has
always been a problem ior Airica, accor-
ding to Clark.

When asked it Americans were general
ly well iniormed about Airican aiiairs and
developments, Clark replied in the

negative and gave three reasons, First is
our education system, western civiliztion
is stressed over all others and African
civilization is largely ignored. Second, the
United States never had any colonies In
Airica and was not as exposed to the contlr
nent as other countries. in tact, it has only
been in recent years that we have had any
substantial trade with Africa. Third,
Americans see Africa as very distant and
very remote and in general do not consider
it a central issue.

Presently, Clark is working atthe Aspen
Institute on an overall U.S, foreign policy
with such notables as former Secretaries
01 State Cyrus Vance and Edmund Muskie.
Clark hopes that the plan will be finished
by the end or the year and ready to be
published early in 1983,

Drake rejects Appeals Board recommendation
Philosophy department stunned; Isen plans to resign

by Anne Rawland

Last Monday, April 12, President George
Drake oiiicially closed the debate on the
promotion and tenure oi Assistant pro
icssor oi Philosophy Dan Margurshak, In a
memo to the Personnel Appeals Board
released to the 5518 by Magurshak, the
president said he had “decided to accept
the recommendation oi the Executive
Council" against the advice oi the Appeals
Board. The original Council decision,
made Jan 23, recommended against
tenuring the philosophy proiessor

Last week the 8&3 reported the Person
nel Appeals Board iound "procedural in
appropriateness" in handling
Magurshak’s case. The board's objections
centered around the Council’s discussion
on the nature oi Magurshak's job. Drake's
memo said. “I am not certain i agree wrth
the inappropriateness finding."

In the appeal Magurshak asked the
board to rule on tour issues. The board
iound in tavor oi the council on the iirst but
discussed the implications oi the other
three,

The issues noted by the board were the
inappropriate use oi one oi his papers as a
representation or his scholarly work, the
possibility that a de iacto tenure quota ex»
ists and the discussion oi his job descrip
tion as a criterion ior tenure.

The Appeals Board urged Drake to table
the case until next year ii Magurshak
would waive his legal right to the “stated
time schedule ior his tenure
consideration.” However, the board said ii
this was legally inappropriate, the presi-
dent should conduct his own investigation

Drake's decision lelt Magurshak, whose
specialty is phenomenology and existen-
tialism, and other members of the
philosophy department stunned. lnstruc~
tor Susan Isen announced she plans to
resign, "I just don't know what to say
anymore," said Magurshak,

However, Magurshak explained he
released the documents to the 5&8
because "I think that the community as a
wholeshould be aware of how decismns
like this can be conducted here and what it
means tor other decisions made at the col-
lege.“

Of the scholarly works considered durs
mg the tenure procedure, the one the coun-
cil focused on had not yet been submitted
for publication Magurshak had presented
the paper to a meeting of the Iowa

-_l?hilosophical-3ociety,i at whichvliime Pro-

iessor Emeritus oi Mathematics George
Apostle obtained a copy. Apostle, who is
best known for his wide scholarship in an
cient philosophy, critqued the paper, made
copies of it and submitted the annotated
copies to some members of the council
prior to Magurshak's tenure revue.

Although Apostle admits his broad
knowledge of philosophy includes many
subsiields, Magurshak‘s is not one of themi
He said, “If the logic is bad then it doesn’t
take a logician to point that out. He
[Magurshak] should use valid logic in his

Philosophy Department Chairman Jack
Worley pointed to psychology protessor
Eric Jacobson as the other iaculty
member denied tenure during the same
time period as Magurshak's case. Jacob—
son, however, did not appeal his case.
When asked whether he felt his case had
been tairly handled Jacobson declined
comment.

Worley said a council member told him
that Chair of the Council Executive Vice
President Waldo Walker was exhorting the
council to be careful in granting tenure

 

 

"There appears to be a conspiracy among certain

members of the administration and faculty to

eliminate the (Magursbak ’5) position,”

held, when asked why he ielt it necessary
to distribute the paper Apostle said, “I
made an input because i ielt as a member
of the Grinnell College community lshould
have an input.”

The Appeals Board termed Apostle's ac-
tions "irregular and regrettable," The
board iound no procedural error on this
issue but said. “The council might have
been wise in this instance to have refrainr
ed irom discussing the paper at all.”

Similar to the Apostle question, the
board iound no procedural error concern
ing the possible existence oi dc iacto quota
system but said, "There appears to be an
upper limit on the percentage oi tenured
iaculty which the Board oi Trustees will
accept " The board went on to note the {fits
ecutive Council discussed the issue just
prior to Magurshak's case.

”The timing oi this discussion, that is.
aiter two positive recommendations ior
tenure had been made. and just prior to
consideration oi two iurther cases. does
raise questions about its possible effect,"

said the board.

because “if we tenure too many people the
trustees will get mad and we'll lose George
Drake.”

Walker denied making the comment or
one similar to it. “I made comments thatl
thought the college had not maintained its
standards," he said. “I said I thought we
had fallen below the normal level of non
contract renewals."

When asked to elaborate Walker replied.
“I don't think what happened in Executive
Council is a matter oi public record so i
don‘t think I should say anymore,"

oi me three lsssues, the Appeals Board
discussed at length and iound procedural
error in the entry of the necessity oi
Magurshak’s concentration at a liberal
arts institute, "We iound no evidence that
this issue [the necessity oi Magurshak's
iieldl had been raised and discussed by the
institution with the department or the ap
pellant prior to the council's consideration
oi Mr. Magurshak ior tenure.

“We iind it procedurally inappropriate
to Initiate such a discussion in a closed sec-
tion at the council wrthout prior consulta-

tion With the entire department and
especially with the person directly involve
ed," said the board.

”About six years ago we brought in two
outside investigators to evaluate our
department; both complimented us on
having the kind of curriculum we needed,"
Worley said. “I didn't write the job
description and it was Written at least
three years before Dan came in 1976.”
Worley also stressed that Magurshak was
already part oi the department at the time
of the investigation.

“There appears to be a conspiracy
among certain members of the ad-
ministration and faculty to eliminate the
lMagurshak'sl position," said Isen. "If
the administration Suddenly decided that
Evolutionary Theory could not be taught
because they believed in creationism, it
would be CDnSidered an obvious abridge
ment of academic freedom.” she con
tinued. “The present decision is entirely
analogous,"

When asked about accusations by
various members oi the campus communi-
ty oi a “conspiracy," Dean or the Faculty
Catherine Frazer refused comment
because, “It is a college policy that the ad-
ministration doesn't comment on person-
nel relations."

Even with the case officially closed,
students and faculty still question the true
nature of the case against Magurshak. “I
think it more than happenstancial that in-
dependently three things went wrong in
the case,” said Worley, especially when
Hie dean of the faculty takes it as part of
her job to guard the sanctity oi the pro-
cedures.”

Isen said she Visited Drake in hi'. office
after the initial council decision and he
hold her he had a negative view oi Magur-
shak's abilities. “I was pressing George
Drake," She said “I asked him what his
sources were. He said other iaculty
members who had talked to Dan but had
not seen him teach and faculty members
who had talked to students I was
appalled,"

“l realize l'm not perfect and not every
student will like me," said Magurshak.
“I‘ve tried to improve. Ultimately i guess
i think that the whole thing is just unfair."
As a result 01' the Magurshak case. The
iaculty will meet in executive session with
the administration Monday evening, April
is, to begin discussing tenure procedures.
