program emphasizes laboratory work
in psychology, According to Prof.
T omas Brozoskl, project director,
"’lhe program at Grinnell is designed
to present psychology as a natural
science.’ Most labs involve recording
animal or human responses to stimuli.
The microcomputers are capable or
recording information from a variety oi
experiements. Belore computers these
data were recorded on crude, expensive
devices. "Today almost all results can
be recorded on microcomputers which
are extremely reliable and have
become less expensive in the lasl 10
years. ‘ Brozoski said
February 20, We)

Besides the microcomputers, the
department has purchased Upcon Con-
ditioning Apparatus which records
responses to stimuli and displays rein-
iorcemeiit requirements for the subs
lects being tested. These reponses can
then be analyzed on the microconi»
puters or the college computer system,

The department first asked lor iunds

laboratory tion oi the courses tour
