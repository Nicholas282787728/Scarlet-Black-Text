Discrimination on campus today tends
to take subtle torms. Diilerent groups ex-
perience it in different. ways. in any case.
discrimination is hard to prove

Rick nose said that "discrimination is
subtle and that not every gay person sees
it.” Not every gay persons experiences
discrimination. “I don‘t feel discriminated
against here." says Thom Barthelmess “I
felt much more comiortable coming
here." Beth Johnson presents a diiierent
picture “I know many people who have
been ostracized." '

' M..l. Constant says that her being gay
had something to do with her getting kick-
ed off the baseball team. “Coach Martinek
mentioned two reasons One, that my
presence was a disruption — that's a quote
— and two, that I wasn't tough enough. The
coach said that it was my presence as a
lesbian. My very being disturbed them. i t
was who I was and not what I did. And if
that‘s not discrimination, I don't know
what is." she concluded. “The guys on the
team and the coach are always ragging on
gays.” she said.

Most gays mention the graffiti in Burling
and verbal harrassment Rick Rose said
that “it's often Very violent.” Gays also
mention the posters promoting the band
F.0.R., which said things like “I’m sick of
lesbians” and “I hate lesbians.”

Gays say that the tone on campus has
worsened recently, Examples include the
vandalism of the art exhibit in Negative
Space. the backlash against allegations oi
homophobia on campus. and the tension
surrounding the demonstrations for the
Gay Resource Center,

Kendyl Linn. visiting her iiancee at
Grinnell. participated in the demonstra-
tion for the Gay Resource Center. She was
walking across campus when she was ver-
bally attacked. “I heard a voice yell atme.
They yelled, ‘hey. lesbian.‘ I was scared, I
didn't know where itcame from so l turned
around and ran back toward Younker "

Others hold more moderate views Rich
Beck says that "when the issue of
homophobia became so large on campus. 1
think it became overblown. But that
doesn't mean it's not a pertinent issue. that
it doesn't exist,"

 

OH, WHAT A
WONDERFUL FELINE!

Discrimination at Grinnell

one oi the most important things to gays
is learning about gay heritage in classes
As classes present them. there are “no gay
writers. no gay painters, no role models.
Thee were no gay people who were sues
ccsslul." says Beth Johnson. “Gays are
denied any history."

“There's nothing overt." said Dave
Dorsey about discrimination against
blacks, Tony Marshall found it “difficult to
articulate" the discrimination she felt.
Many pointed to the scarcity oi black proV
fessors it) and inadequate recruitment ef~
iorts in admissions as examples of at least
unconscious discrimination. Todd Coulter
says that blacks have been refused Oppor»
tunitie's to do research projects over the
summer. Vaiesta Wiggins thinks there is a
certain degree of “institutionalized
racism,"

Wiggins says that sometimes blacks are
patronized, People “tell Richard Pryor
jokes or talk in a black accent because
they think I’ll like it.”

K.C. McClanahan tells of one black stun
dent who moved to South campus, and
later ended up leaving Grinnell. Shortly
aiter she arrived on her new iioor. “she
head somebody say. ‘oh, we got another
black student', It shows the insensitivity of
students.” He continued, saying “people
make jokes and expect people to be in-
tegrated and thererore it's okay to make
that ioke."

McClanahan said that he was
discriminated against when he applied to
become an SA. “1 went through the inter-
View process. i was not accepted as an SA
but as an alternate. Later, there was a
shortage of SAS, so Flossie Mitchell called
me. , , She said the reason you were not ac
cepted was that the committee who inter-
viewed you felt that you did not have
enough white iriends to warrant being an
SA. She said she realized it was not a good
criterion . . said McCianahan. He said
that this implies that one ”had to have a
certain number of white friends to be
validated as socially iunctional."

Dorsey says that there are “a lot of pre-
judices and sterotypes on campus because
most students do not have a lot oi exposure
to blacks.” McClanahan agrees that there
is “not much integration between black
students and White students."

Specific examples oi discrimination
against women are difficult to identify,
Rebecca Weston points to where women
are employed in the college, She says the
Food Service and the maids are women,

Kim Judis mentions that women
generally are reluctant to speak in class.
“It’s part of what is expected behavior,"
she says, Laura Jajesnica says she has
heard that men tend to take control in lab
situations,

In academics, they find more reason to
be critical. “1 think they do a miserable

Job trying to incorporate women into the
curriculum." says JaJesnlca She says
that students have requested prolessors to
present reminisi interpretations in class,
The prolessors declined. saying that they
don't know ierninist critiques well enough,
"It's their job to know about it." says Ja-
iesnica

JUUIS says thai her proiessors ignoreu

women's issues were to be incorporated in
to the classes. “Not one Of my professors
did." says Judis,

The prevailing attitudes towards women
are hard to characterize. Jaiesnica mens
tions negative attitudes on campus
towards teminism, “When I tell people I'm
a ieminist, they think rm radical. angry,
that i hate men." she says, Judis is en-
couraged that some men “take an interest
in Women’s Groups."

Conservatives on campus experience
much more oiten displays at
discriminatory behavior. “I was labelled
homophobic ior just opposing the Gay
Resource Center. I thought they didn’t
need their own room." says Todd
Troutner,

Following the raid on Libya, posters an
nounced that a “discussion" would take
place in North Lounge. Mark Hallerberg
describes what took place at that meeting,
“It was assumed from the Start that the
discussion was going to be about protest I
said that any U.S. president would have
done the same thing. People started
shouting all sorts of things. The whole at-
mosphere was antagonistic," he says.

An even more graphic example occurred

May SI. ltixii

discussing the contra issue in Loose
Lougnc "We were called to our laces
'babykillers' We wee able to continue to
discuss because each side refrained from
Neanderthaiic nainescallliig and allowed a
real debate to occur."

It was even suggested that some people
bring discrimination upon themselves or
use their membership in a minority group
as an excuse to claim discrimination
“People tend to hide behind a minority."
says Thom Barthelmess.

Meanwhile. the social isolation of
blacks. conservatives. gays. and to a
lesser extent women and athletes con-
tinues, McCianahan says that blacks will
feel more comfortable with a larger and
more diverse mix of black students, He
suggests that 120 to 130 black students.
especially more irom innercity areas.
would be good There would be a better
support network, so blacks could stop wor-

rying about “survival" and become more
involved in the campus community.

The issue of the Gay Resource Center is
another symptom of social isolation. Some
gays admit they are less open about their
homosexuality nowadays. Paul Mac»
cready remarks how conservatives tend to
assomate with the small part of the Cams
bus that is not liberal.‘

That npen-mindedness would do much to
dissolve sterotypes and prejudice seems
obvious. Whether it is realistic to assume
that such open-mindednus is possible to
attain and how much it can reduce
discrimination is a matter of opinion.

quality tor investment.” Phil Cantor said,

"Any company that Grinnell divests from
does not oualily ror investment."

In explaining the Board's reason ror not
boycotting Ford. Drake said. “a boycott oi
Ford was seen to lead to hurting the
already struggling Grinnell economy."
Drake went on to point out that a boycott of
Ford would hurt the local Ford dealership
in town and the college does not want to do
this

Another justification ior not boycotting
Ford was the possible implications of
boycotts on other automotive companies.
Drake said, “The trustees believed that a
Ford boycott could possibly lead to a
boycott at all other automotive companies
The trustees said that they did not want to
race that possibility."

As tor the MGM/UA boycott. Drake said

that the trustees Wanted to remain consis
tent with their boycotts. Drake said. “We
couldn't very well boycott MGM/UA and
not boycott Ford.”

There have been accusations that the
Board Voted to review the divestment
policy at this meeting as a result of the
absence of Gardiner Button and Andrew
Loweli who not only sit on the Investor
Responsibility Committee out are also
reported to be in favor or divestment. Carr
tor said, ”I think some people took advan
tage of the tact that Loweli and button
were not at the meeting." Yet. Drake said
that probably the tact that Loweii and nut-
lon were not at the meeting prevented the
Board from coming to a linal decision.

students to End Apartheid have begun a
petition drive and have scheduled a protest
or the Board's decison today at 4:00 in
iront oi Nollen House. The trustees plan to
meet again in Grinnell in midrNovember.
