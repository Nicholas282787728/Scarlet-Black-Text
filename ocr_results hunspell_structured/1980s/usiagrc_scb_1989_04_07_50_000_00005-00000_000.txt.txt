Former concerts chair
defends Georgia Dentel

To the editor.

Having been chairperson of
last year‘s Concerts Committee
and thus having been a party to
the debate concerning certain
changes in that committee‘s
structure, I would like to clarify
misapprehensions and misinfor~
mations that have appeared in
statements in recent issues of the
Scarlet and Black.

. . . Last spring, the vice
president. the vice president-elect
the treasurer, and the treasurer-
appointed determined that the
Films and Concens Committees
held too much power. Thus.
ironically, they authoritatively
altered the entertainment pro-
gram‘s structure without one
word to you, the students. Act-
ing in the name of power re»
strained, these five gents sat in a
Forum office (sadly not smoke-
ﬁllcd) and de facto fired Georgia
Dentel, adviser to the Films and
Concerts Committees and an
employee [of] the college for over
25 years.

Mr. Killion and friends would
like to suggest that other impor-
tant changes have been made to
committee structure because the
chairperson had too much power
and was “out of the SGA mainv
stream.” These changes include a
“new" committee, a “new" Joint
Board representative, and ”new"
chairperson accountability to
Joint Board. What is not men-
tioned is that these “changes" are,
in fact. mercly constitutional
ratifications of timevevolvcd
committee structure. Last year‘s
Concerts Committee participated
in all facets of the problem from
booking to amplifier placement.
I personally had the tedious plea-
sure of sitting through the Joint
Board every week and was also a
member of the All-Campus
Events and Public Events Com-
mittees. If I was not in the Stur
dent Government Association
mainstream I apologize.

As regards the use of River
Cities Sound (RCS) [or all but
two of the 1987-1988 concerts, it
must be made clear that this was
entirely the committee's decision
and not Ms. Dentel‘s. In the
spring of ‘87 Liz Johnson
(president-elect) and l travelled to
Iowa City to inquire into sound-
company alternatives. It was the
considered opinion of the people
we spoke to that RCS was the
best sound company in the upper
Midwest. The committee used
RCS because of the beneﬁts of
working with them on a regular
basis, because they knew our
venues and had worked here in
commendable fashion for years,
and, more importantly, because
they were the best. This year’s
soundeompany policy is merely
the exercise of an existent com»
mittee prerogative, nothing less,
nothing more.

Related to this issue is that of
budget finance. Messers Kolb
and Rita complain of the vicissi»
tudes of budget structures. .
.They labor under the very same
budget and booking world that
thc ‘87-‘88 committee did.
Working within that sclfsame
budgct we were able to book ev-
ery available weekend, bringing
23 quality acts to Grinnell in two

semesters, pay RC5, and still
come in nearly $2,000 under
budget.

The real issue here, then, is
the disuse of Ms. Dentel's skills.
Why have a handful of students
decided to dismiss the services of
an adviser to the student govern»
ment whose salary is paid by the
administration? What is Mr.
Killion afraid of when he states,
“lmplying that in some way
bringing back Georgia Dentel
would improve our films and
concerts program implies that it's
going to improve because she‘s
going to have a hand in what
we‘re seeing and that‘s unaccept—
able to us“? Read that again and
then tell me that Rob's primary
concern is the quality of the pro-
gram.

Ms. Dentel has doubtless
helped share the program through
the years in her close contact

with the committee and through
her thorough knowledge of the
business. The quality of the
program speaks for itself. I
would be remiss if I didn‘t thank
her for being an invaluable re-
source to the ‘87-‘88 committee.
However, it is imponant to em»
phasize that at no point did Ms.
Dentel personally select a con-
cert. That is and always has been
solely the responsibility of the
committee

It is for good reason, thus.
that I join every other concerts
chairperson of the 19805 in stat-
ing that Ms. Dentel is a unique
and valuable asset to the Grinnell
College Community. In the best
interests of the program this
year's experiment must be con-
cluded. it is sad to think that 25
years‘ experience must be dis-
missed and disused in such fash»
ion. Leif Larsen ‘88

Corea's agent says SGA
misreported concert costs

To the editor.

We are writing to publicly
correct statements made in the
March 10, 1989 Grinnell College
Scarlet and Black regarding fees
paid for what was referred to as
the “Chick Corea concerts" of
November 8. 1986, and Septem-
ber I0, 1988 at Grinnell College.

Georgia Dentel’s booking of
November 10, 1986 was
misrepresented in the Scarlet and
Black statement. Her booking
for $7,500 was not only for the
Chick Corea Band, but also for
the Alan Holdsworth Band from
England, as well. Also, the
$7,500 fee included sound
prodttction of $1,000. Thus, the
artist’s fees for both groups was
$6,500. >

The Student Government

Association booking for $5,500
was for one band only —the
Chick Corea Band—and did not
include sound production of
$1.000, which raised the total fee
to 56,500.

The negotiation of fees be
tween buych and artists' agencies
is considered to be a private mat-
ter between booker and agency.
Public discussion of fees repre-
sents a breach of ethics. Not
only did the Student Government
Association make fees public,
but they compounded their error
by reporting the facts inaccur
rately. We are disturbed by the
misrepresentation both of Miss
Dontcl‘s work and of our artists’
fees. Ted Kurland Associ-

Kent blasts Macho‘s
pro-choice argument

To the editor:

I am writing this week in re-
sponse to Mr. Macho's column
“Clash Over Abortion."

Mr. Macho's column con-
tained so many logical fallacies I
don‘t know where to begin. To
start with. Mr. Macho has
characterized all members of the
prolife movement as persons who
scream verbal abuse at women
seeking abortions, condone
bombing clinics. have as their
primary motivation the desire to
control women‘s bodies, oppose
child-care spending, are unaware
of “back-alley abortions,“ oppose
the use of birth control, and are
generally “fanatics" (religious
and political).

Mr. Macho, lam pro-life and
I am none of these things. Bang,
that whole aspect of your argu-
mcnt has just been shot down.
Even if any of your accusations
were correct they wouldn‘t have

anything to do with the real
abortion debate because they are
ad homincm attacks.

Mr. Macho has presented a
rather humorous straw-man posi
tion of the pro-life ideology.
You say that by not opposing
thcm, pro-lifcrs are saying they
agree with the tactics of Opera-
tion Rescue. What about the
National Right to Life Commit-
tee? What about Abortion Altcrr
natives? What about the Na-
tional Lobby for the Human Life
Amendment? Operation Rescue
is hardly a representative group of
the American 'pro-lifc movement.
It is a single fringe group that is
being sensationaltzcd by the me-
dia. Would you like to assume
responsibility for all pro
choiccrs, Mr. Macho? You've
got some real winners: Lyndon

Reader proposes an
on abortion

open forum

To the editor.

I want to end the silence. Mr.
Macho.

I am an avid "pro-lifcr”7life
is NOT a malfunction—and
therefore feel that I must respond
to Matt Macho‘s article “Clash
Over Abortion." Several points
come to mind. . .First, let me
say that 1 am a member of the
National Organization of Episco-
palians for Life (NOEL), though
my opinions may vary slightly
from NOEL’s official creed.
However. the fact that I do be-
long to this association proves
that I am quite serious. Sec-
ondly, I do not advocate outlaw-
ing abortion. Rather, I feel that
abortion should not even be a le»
gal issue. I fail to understand
why or how a “democratic“ gov—
crnment can dictate morality.
For this reason, you will not ﬁnd

me bombing abortion clinics

or engaging in the hypocrisy so
common amongst those who do.
In addition, I don’t think that
anyone has the right to control
the body or the mind of another
human being. Why not allow
our legal and educational systems
to do their jobs and free them of
the parental role they have been
forced to adopt? Morality is
something one has, believes in,
and uses to deﬁne oneself. . .not
something to be “enforced."
Abortion must certainly be clase
sifted as a moral issue.

Clearly, the “clash over abor-
tion" is not going to simply go
away. I would therefore like to
issue a challenge to all campus
organizations: Would anyone like
to sponsor some type of open
forum or debate on the topic?
