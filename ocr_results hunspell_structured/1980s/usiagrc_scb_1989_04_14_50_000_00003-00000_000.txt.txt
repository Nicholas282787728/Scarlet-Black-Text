“Personally, I don’t think we
would have been in violation of
our non-discrimination policy. i .
But, the perception would have
been that it was discriminatory."
Drake said. in an interview with
the Scarlet and Black. Many of
the protesters expressed displca»
sure with Drake’s decision on the
grounds that it did not demon-
strate the commitment to equal
rights that they felt the college
had shown when it included gays
and lesbians in its non-discrimi-
nation policy.

“What frightens me is that.
when they were confronted with a
policy that threatened their non~
discrimination policy, dtey with-
drew rights from everyone . . .
There's no commitment here to
giving rights to people. On the
conuary, they‘re willing to take
them away,” said Matt Macho.

“On paper [the non-
discrimination policy] is a very
important ﬁrst step. t , . The
thing that concerns me is the
depth of the commiunent," said

real motivation behind Drake’s
decision. “I’m not sure. as a {ne-

being drawn; if it‘s fear or if it's
principle." Cooley echoed Ha-

committee had “discharged feebly
and haphazardly“ its general du»
ttes of reviewing the curriculum
and that this was "attributable
mainly to the presence of stu-
dents on the Committee.“

Killion said that in order to
ensure student input, he has asked
that all memos and findings cir»
culated by the subcommittee also
be sent to him so that they may
be discussed by the Student
Council on Curriculum, The
SCC is made up of 22 students,

ports are sent to Duke and Mof—
fett, Kiltion said.

Moffctt denies that the sub-
committee was formed to cir-
cumvent the student body. He
said the Executive Council had
discussed the need for curricular
review a year ago in their cnd—of~

think about acknowledging the
rights of gay people," Cooley
said. adding that “It may not have
been a direct attack on gay and
lesbian rights, but that‘s how it
turned out.”

Crady said in an S and B
interview that he opposed adding
the same-sex marriage exemption
to the policy for the same reason
as was stated by Drake.

"If we allow a change in the
policy now, we would open our-
selves up for requests for more
changes in the future," Crady
said. He said he was also very
concemod that the policy be clear;
1y nondiscriminatory. While he
is not sure whether the old
housing policy violated the non-
discrimination statement, he is
conﬁdent about the new policy.
"The new policy can be uni-
formly applied to everyone. i . so
it‘s fair." he said.

Although the public protest
over the policy is now over,
Cooley, Macho and other demon-
strators vow that they will not let
the issue die.

"It was a sly move on his
part, but it was the wrong move
It‘s not ending here." said Macho.

At their meeting Wednesday,

addressed to Drake. thaldiscusst‘d
their disagreement with his deci-
sion, In the ﬁnal paragraph. the
letter states that "The students of
Grinnell College wish to ac-
knowledge that same-sex couples
are as valid as heterosexual cou-
pies. Yourdecision is a refusal
to listen to Joint Board opinion.
Mr. DrakE. your decision is very
apt politically, bu| very disap-
pointing morally."

over the summer he and Duke had
spoken about the possibility of
forming a subcommittee to
gather faculty views on the cur-
riculum. The division chairs
were then asked last fall if they
were willing to do this. he added,

Moffctt said the students’
opinions are important to the
process. "If [the subcommittee]
