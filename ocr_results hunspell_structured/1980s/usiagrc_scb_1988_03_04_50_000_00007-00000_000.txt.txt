Mornin

Prey Upon Children

John N ewmark

On Saturday, March 5, irom 4 to
5 p.m.. in Clark Hall's lounge, the
Grinnell Debating Union will have
its second meeting, All those in
terested in public speaking and
debate are encouraged to attend.
Those who are interested but have
questions can contact Tanweer
Akram, David Karol, Sarah
Ludington, John Newmark, or
Beth Wodzinski.

li anyone is wondering, this
week’s column centers around a
fear that is expressed fairly often
in newspapers and magazines. Ap-
parently vast numbers oi organiza
tions, mostly composed oi people
over the age of 30, sit in front of
television sets every Saturday
morning to watch cartoons. These
people, who seem to be iairly well-
adjusted adults, Claim that “this is
a dirty job, but someone has to do
it.” After a year of watching these
shows over and over, they decide
that the shows are horrible and
shouldn't be watched even by
children. It has taken them a year
to find this out, a little longer than
it takes the average child, but a
least they have reached the conclu-
sion.

Seriously, these organizations
have iound something that needs to

be talked about. I don’t know how
many people have seen the movie
starring Doris Day and Rock Hud-
son called “Lover Come Back.” In

realizes the product doesn’t exist,
and then creates the product.
Seemingly, the normal process has
been reversed. The question as to
the ethics of this maneuver is
downplayed in the movie a bit by
the unpredictable romance bet-
ween Hudson and Doris Day;
however, that is inconsequential. 1
would much rather talk about
ethics than romance in this col-
umn. it might not be your
preierence {or reading material,
but is is my preterence ior column
topics.

The organizations that watch the
Saturday~mornlng cartoons have
noticed that the TV shows are
basically anrminute adverr
tisements ior toys. The normal
process between Tv cartoon and
toys is that the show is shown (or a
year or two and then toys pattern-
ed alter the show's characters ap~
pear on the market. Recently,
however, the reverse has happen-
ed, Toys are produced and then the
cartoons featuring the toys are

This Colunm has often been
devoted to issues of administrative
apathy towards the students The
current race for the ofﬁces of SGA
president and vice president has
turned its focus on the apathy oi
the students towards SGA. Most of
the candidates addressed this issue
either directly or indirectly, and
they should he landed.

it has been a potentially pivotal
year tor the college, We have seen
progressive projects such as the
Speakeasy and the Relays/Peace
Weekend proposal come to liie, We
have witnessed the acceptance oi
the 372 program and the controverr
sy which has ensued. We have seen
our athletic program plummet to
disturbing depths.

But along with this Change have
come reactions It has in the past
been somewhat difﬁcult to ascerr
tain the general student opinion of
a given situation because oi the in-
difference with which We greeted
change. Now it seems that not an
issue of the Scarlet and Black goes
by without containing several wellr
expressed ideas or rehuttals irom
readers and reporters Although
the Central theme of these articles
has too often been negative, this
column certainly included, the
quantity oi concern has been en-
couraging to those of us who care
about this college and its com~
munity.

The special issue of the S and 8
contains extensive statements
Irom all of the candidates, It seems
that there is general agreement on
major issues of the diversity of the
students, faculty and curriculum,
buffer days, and the 3-2 program,
The roadblock which needs to be
overcome in order to improve
these and other issues is the lack of
communication. This is alarmingr
ly prevalent on all levels: SGA, the
students, faculty and administra»
tion

Before we can hope to address
any oi these issues we must form
networks of Communication bet

ween the above groups, SGA,
speciiically the president and vice
president, is uniquely qualitied to
initiate this process, because it is
the only one oi the tour organiza-
tions which will soon have a ture
nover in membership.

As potential oiiiceholdcrs the
candidates should realize the dire
need ior SGA to become more acr
cessible to the masses. Very iew oi
us have been to a Joint Board
meeting, and the weekly minutes
in the paper do little to clariiy
anything The next president
should plan on writing a weekly ar-
ticle outlining the implications oi
the minutes. Steps like this will
serve to unity the students, which
in turn will make our demands oi
the administration more
creditable, while simultaneously
opening lines oi communication
with the other groups, The past has
shown that SGA has insutticient
power to promote or protest
change (the acquisition oi paper
cups in the Grill had to be turned
into a virtual holy crusade bciore
the recent action was taken to
eliminate styroloam).

As voters we should recognize
the candidates who have presented
their ideas clearly and realisticalr
ly. Some oi them are running with
a lack oi conviction which would
serve only to perpetuate the phanr
tom existence or SGA. This is hard
1y an amazing phenomenon when
you have a candidate roster that
reads like a phone book. Who isn't
running lor otiice (besides Paul
noose»? Experience in SGA is a
persuaSlve credential. but involve
ment in non-government activities
should be equally commended We
as voters should reward those who
have committed themselves to the
betterment oi Grinnell and will
continue to serve the entire student
body it elected, The special issue is
lengthy, but It should be read with
the utmost care, Change is on the
horizon, and we have an opportunir
ty to control it.

this ethical?

The answer is obvious. Children

However. they are not adverr
tisements. it is my assumption
that the toy manutacturers are not
paying the television networks to
run these 30-minute ads. Not only
are they getting uniair television

getting less and less educational
and more commercial. Even it the
networks were being paid an
amount proportional to the price ot
a Zorsecond advertisement (and
considering what that price would
be, this is highly unlikelyl the

One who was trying to delend the

cess, once the toys are on the
market the cartoon is reduced to

When i was younger, I used to
work out models of when abortion
was OK and when it was not OK. I
used to think about how rape
should justiry it. and about how it a
woman’s liie was in danger the
rules should somehow be changed,
I used to have discussions with my
iriends, and we used to teel very
mature and analytical: somehow
we had come up with a wise set or
rules that would work nicely ior
society. We had other neat
schemes and plans, too. about
nuclear weapons. and biological
weapons, and when it was OK to
destroy other civilizations.

Anyway, 1 had a very ditiicult
year following my jaunt with
ethical reasoning, and came to
realize that the number oi ques-
tions that I could not answer exV
ceeded those that I could by an un~
thinkable amount. One at the BIG
questions which arose, to which i
could but shrug and look sheepish.
was, “What gives you the right to
tell other people what they can do
with their bodies?" It is a question
which I have still not found an
answer for. and one that I doubt I
ever will. Who am i to pass
judgments on others' actions
which do not affect me — Mr,
Perfect Morality? Thus I have
avoided making any statement on
abortion.

All was well and good when I
came to Grinnell: people that I
talked to during my first few mon-

Senator Supports
Day” Decision

Marc Bass

A lot of people showed up last
Thursday in ARH 11 to hear Joint
Board discuss the late or Relays
XVI, When the Scarlet and Black
published the result of the rolercall
vote in last Friday's issue. I got a
lot oi abuse irom many oi my
friends, iew oi whom make up my
constituency, about the way 1
voted Anyone who was at the
meeting last week can tell you that
ior the most part the senators were
quiet; some asked questions, but
very iew made any statements. I
am one oi the exceptions. 1 went in
to the special session with my mind
made up as to which way i should
vote, I spoke oi my opinions, and
now I want to let the entire campus
know why 1 voted tor the so—called
“Peace Day” proposal and what I
believe the reasons were that Joint
Board iinally approved this pro-
posal instead of the so~called
“traditional games."

First and foremost. the Peace
Day was what my constituents
wanted. or the offrcampus people
that I talked to, the vast majority
were in support oi some kind or
Relays that was well-organized
and promised to be enjoyable, not
like last year, which, although fun,
was just not up to our usual stan
dards of excellence. I allowed most
oi the people I talked to the oppor~
(unity to read the two proposals
lhow many other senators did this
instead or just saying, “Do you
want a beer bash or do you want a
peace day?”), provided that l had
them on my person at any given
moment. I ran into one woman at
the Forum Grill. and asked her
which oi the two proposals she
favored. Her answer was, ”Even
peace makers need a chance to
blow off steam‘” I took this to

mean that she wanted the socalled
“traditional relays.” so i asked,
“Have you read the two
proposals?" Her answer was no.
So i pulled out the proposals and let
her read them, When she was done
she said that she preierred the
Peace Day proposal. That was not
Just an isolated example; it hap-
pened almost every time that I
talked to somebody,

This brings me to my second
reason ior voting "propeace."
Organization! Anybody that was at
Joint Board will tell you that Liz
(Johnsonl and denniier lMillerl
came in very well-prepared. They
had done their ground work and
were ready to answer questions,
Ken Varnum did pretty well tor the
“traditionalists,” but he was toting
some pretty unwanted and heity
baggage with him. Quite irankly,
they just didn’t have the
background or the presentation
that Liz and Jennifer did. Going in-
to the meeting, the pcaceday sup-
porters rigured that we could get
about eight or nine safe votes. l am
sure that some oi the 15 that voted
tor the Peace Day proposal were
swayed by the savvy oi the presen-
tation

My iinal reason ior voting ior
Peace Day is my own personal
bias. You see, as 1 said in Joint
Board, this will be my iilth relays,
Unlike the vast majority oi the peo»
pic on campus. 1 can remember a

remember a parade that ventured
into town. and i can remember a
huge inilated can oi Bud Lite!

to visit this campus in late April

Thought

ths here were prorchuice and didn't
give me a hard time ior renouncing
my right to have a say in the issue,
While some people did tell me that
they thought abortion was wrong,
they did not appeal to arguments
that persuaded me; they appealed
to religious texts as the source of
absolute moral truth. Don’t get me
wrong — moral absolutism is a fine
deiense, and i use it iairly otten.
But when it is grounded on a less-
than-empirical or universally
evident foundation. it loses all
strength as an argument. In simple
words: not all people believe that
the Bible is the ultimate source of
morality; thus, it you say to sea
meone that the Bible tells us that
abortion is wrong, they may argue
that they do not see why anyone
should think that the Bible is right.
l have spoken to people oi many
religious backgrounds and have
not yet been given a really sound
argument against abortion that I
ielt could be universally accep~
table or serve me as a moral im»
perative. Uniortunately, l have
iriends who like to argue about
everything. both as a mental exer-
cise, and out oi a love at arguing
for its own sake. Last winter. dur~
ing that time when people know
that they have to go back to school
soon and would rather spend more
time loafing at home, I had just

Questions about liabilities were

The snow ience was put to use. and

iirst public appearances by a five-
piece band calling themselves Sher

Quite irankly, anybody who was at
the games last year (there weren't
many, so it should be easy to iden-
tiiy themt will tell you that they
just weren't up to par. So this year
we had the chance to make a big
change and still have a good time.
The Peace Day proposal was
beautiful. Lots of fun, a great-
sounding Skip Day, and the chance
to hear some great bands and imr
portant speakers. With a little help
from Mother Nature, Relays XVI
should be one oi the best ones yet.
Too bad H, Wayne Moyer isn't here

wants to get involved in Relays to

There is a great deal oi work to be
