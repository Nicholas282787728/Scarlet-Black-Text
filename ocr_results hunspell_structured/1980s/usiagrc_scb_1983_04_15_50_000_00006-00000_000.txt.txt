A Softball Soliloquy

by Jenny Phibbs

We are not all so fortunate. We cannot all
respond to the gracious offerings which the
South presents to all ballplayers alike:
warm sunshine, dl'y, raked fields and even
the grapeiruit leagues.

But it seems as it through instinct most
serious players will shed the burden or a
heavy down jacket and oversized hiking
boots and lly south lor spring training, In»
deed, If not a natural inclination, then this
annual sojourn appears to be at least the
most logical plan oi action; up north in
central Iowa, the groundhog has seen her
shadow. And it is still snowing.

The Grinnell College Women's Softball
Team has not ilown south and the perSlSr
tent winter, denying a theoretical applica
tion or spring, has been preventing the
team from “showing their stuff". Their
first four games have been cancelled,
Weather permitting, there will be a home
doubleheader tomorrow at 1 pm against
Indian Hills.

Poor weather conditions have kept the
team inside for practices and this has
naturally affected inleldual and team
performance.

Head Coach Cathie Schweitzer believes
that both the cancellations and indoor
practices are iostering a mental staleness
within the team. “People are starting to
get lazy in terms of fielding. Also, the flute
fielders are not getting the kind at practice
they need,"

Nevertheless she is optimistic about
overall team ability once they are allowed
to compete. Schweitzer applauds the
defense and the improvement of the inexV
perienced pitching squad has shown over
the course of the season.

The new pitching machine has aided the
players batting by altording consistent
and repeated pitches. As at yet, however,
the team's batting ability has not been
challenged and an accurate estimate of
their talent cannot be made

Captains Lisa ingenito and Kathy Cullen
echo the coach‘s statements. Lisa sees the
accuracy of the iniield plays as a deiinite
strength “Our iielding is good enough to
field any ball."

Kathy cited the depth or the team as a
contributing positive factor. with 22
players, each position has at least two
players who can iill that position. Several
individuals show great talent in more than
one position,

The members of the softball team still
wear heavy down jackets and oversized
hiking boots to practice; the rain and snow
fall. But the overwhelming des e to don a
light T~shirt and cleats is an everepresent
compulsion with which they contend. They
are ready to play — they have waited too
long Come out and see,
