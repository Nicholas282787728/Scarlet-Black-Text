by Debbie Saeger

Bill Connet, lay minister, Drake
Newman Community. echoed the Pontiff's
words, Sept. 18, during his explication of
“The Catholic Bishops' Pastoral Letter on
War and Peace” to an audience ofstudents
and townspeople,

Connet gave a brief history of the docu-
ment, which underwent four drafts before
a final vote of 238-9 was taken May 3 in
Chicago, He explained that the bishops
chose to write the letter because “the arms
race is the most pressing question facing
mankind and must be addressed.” Accor-
ding to Connet, the letter, based on
judgements of the Second Vatican Council,
principles of Catholic teaching, and opi-
nions of popes in the nuclear age,
presented premises upon which a lasting
peace should be constructed,

Connet presented the premises as they
were categorized in the letter: war, deter-
rence, disarmament, personal conscience,
the use oi nuclear weapons, and promoting
peace.

A major purpose of the letter, according
to Connet, was to determine if nuclear was
ever moral, The bishops stated that
“under no circumstances" were nuclear
weapons to be used “for the purpose of
destroying population centers of other
predominantly civilian targets." (U S,
Bishops’ Summary) They added that the
initiation of nuclear war was not morally
justifiable and urged the adoption of a “no
first use" policy.

The bishops also question the theory of
”limited" nuclear wars and concluded
that the “first imperative is to prevent any
use of nuclear weapons... and resist the no-
tion that nuclear conflict can be limited,"
(us. Bishops' Summary)

Connet stated, “The only way we can
think about nuclear war is in terms of

prevention,.. any nuclear war would be the
last epidemic ”

To prevent nuclear war and promote
peace, the bishops advocated bilateral
agreements "to hold testing, production;
and deployment of new nuclear weapon
’systems " (US, Bishops' Summary) They
also suggested “deep cuts in the arsenals
of both superpowers" and efforts to control
the arms race and prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons,

Following Connet's summary of the
main premises of the letter he stated
responses received from the politically lelt
and right.

Connet said the left was united in its
belief that the bishops “hadn’t gone far
enough" and should have condemned
possession of any nuclear weapons.

The right, however, put forward several
different objections, according to Connet.
He said common complaints were that
bishops weren’t qualified to give specific
application, that lay people should deal
with the problem, and that the bishops
were isolated from the mainstream of
thought.

Phyllis Sclilaily, who had previously
supported catholic principles regarding
issues such as abortion, has spoken out
sharply against the letter. "The pastoral
we wish the bishops had written,“ tated
Schlafly, would have declared that "the
nuclear weapon in the hands of the United
States is the most powerful material vehia
cle for peace the world has every known "
She added. “The really Christian View is
that death is not the worst evil, sin is
worse, cowardice is worse, dishonor and
betrayal are worse,” Schlafly also sug-
gested that the bishops' statement was
dangerous “because it leads Catholics
down the road of pacifism,.. and disarmar
ment and loving the Russians."

‘ AdeHoc chair named

by M. Wolfgang Schumann.

This Wednesday's Joint Board meeting
was a relatively quiet one.

Bernadette Connors has been appointed
chairwoman of the ad hoc curriculum
committee, which will distribute a ques
tionnaire solicting students’ opinions on
the proposed curriculum changes next Fri»
day. Younker President Mike Marcus sug-
gested looking into what'seemed to be ab—
normally high installation charges for
students' private phones, Auditor Laura
Rutherford announced met there is $1390
left in the General Budget Fund,

while money this year is tight for all
SGA projects, the motion to appropriate up
to $250 lor the United Way was passed by
Joint Board. “It is a joint college and com-
munity project, which we don't have
enough of on campus,” said Treasurer
Robbie Sckalor. Younker President Mike
Marcus said that “in terms of what the
town does for us, this is something we

should do for them. I don't think that
”2501’s really too much,"

There was some opposition, though, in

an organization that formalized cuts in
several budgets last week. Theresa
Seeberg, a representative at o l Campus
Non-College-Owned housing, said,
want to sound like an antirphilanthropist,
. [but] I don't see why we should use Stu-
dent Government money for this.“ She
said she felt that United Way was a good
cause but that Joint Board really couldn't
spare the money for something for which it
wasn’t really responsible.

Sckalor disagreed. “I think that [coma
munity good willl's something you can't
really put a price on, . .Jt’s student money
going into things other than parties." The
Joint Board passed the motion and the
matching fund was approved overwhelm»

ingly.

College gets P.O. box

by niian Broderick

Beginning October 1, Grinnell College
will have its own post ofﬁce box number
and zip codes, This new system will help
the Postal Service sort and deliver mail
more quickly to the college.

Clyde French, director of the Campus
Post Office, said that the new system will
do the work or twentyrfive people. ”The
college," French added, “has never had a
C—rinnell street address, so it was assigned
a post office box number." The box
number and zip codes will speed up bulk
mail sorting in Des Moines, where all mail
headed for Grinnell is sorted, As a result,
according to French, most mail should

reach students‘ boxes by 8:30 am on an
average day.

In Des Monies, mail is that sorted by the
no. box number and zip code, and then by
name and personal box number in the
Campus Post Office, Letters without the
new box number or zip code will be hand
sorted in Des Moines, and will thus arrive
much later than electronically sorted let»
lets.

While the college will have several 9
digit zip codes, it will have only one post of-
fice box number (cos), and all students will
have the same zip code, suitcases.

liberal education, but that it is best left
would not consider a Student liberally
undefined, Christiansen said that those
who are receiving a liberal education
should be exposed to the sciences, the fine
arts, social studies, and the humanities,
and be given the opportunity to form a real
understanding of all of these.

Working irom their own “quasi-
definitions,” Kintner and Christiansen ar-
rive at different conclusions Klntner ops
poses the requirement proposal. while he
sees some good points in the proposal, he
does not believe that requirements will in
Sure a liberal education. “I don't like the
overall plan of trying to insist that every
student must complete a certain set of
things, and then thereby. . . think that we
have satisfied ourselves that they have ac-
quired a liberal education, A liberal educa»
tion lics, quite irankly, in the instructor,
not in the Curriculum " Kintner also
believes that the current system is produc-
ing liberally educated students. "If there
is one thing that everyone 1 have talked to
agrees upon 7 the president says it, the
alumni say it 7 everyone is agreed that
Grinnell students by and large are inquir»
ing, interested people. practically every
one of them considers their education Just
started. A liberal education is a lifetime
operation. What you need to do is get them
started. and I think we've done a pretty
good job of it."

Professor christiansen supports the pres
posed requirements. He argues that the
problem which the proposal addresses is
"the percentage of students that leave
with something that is not what would be
described by the great majority of people
as a genuinely liberal education." He
focused on science and exposure to
another culture as areas without which he

educated. Christiansen said that Lhe advis-
ing system worked well as an advising
system, “but it is a very poor design to
achieve a set of requiremenB if that's
what you have in mind." He argued that
the abolishmenl of requirements has
created a ”hidden agenda." “We advertise
ourselves as having no requirements, and
then when they [students] gethere, the ads
visors busily try to twist their arms to take
these courses, which are the courses they
should be taking anyway, i think it's quite
unfair, it's false advertising,” Chrlss
tiansen emphasized the importance of
assuring that liberally educated studens
be able to understand the issues of our
time “In an era where we have a
desparate need of an intelligent electorate
in connection with matters involving
science, technology, and quantitative
thinking, to allow somebody to leave Grin-
nell College, , , totally innocent ofany real
knowledge of these areas is inexcusable,”

Ono's definition, or at least one's criteria
for assessing liberal education, seems to
affect one's approach to the question of re-
quirements. For Professor Kintner, who
Views liberal education as an attitude, and
a way of approaching knowledge, re-
quirements do nothing to further liberal
education and may be harmful. Professor
Christianscn emphasizes the exposure of
the student to particular areas ol
knowledge. For him requirements make a
great deal of sense,

“Whal is liberal education?" is-a ques-
tion that deserves some thought. Students
and faculty alike might benefit from turnr
ing this question over in their minds before
September 25. The iirst faculty meeting to
discuss the Parslow proposal will be on
that date at 4:15 in Science 171

U.S.S.R. travel possible
after KAL

by Eric Lusk

when Korean Airlines Flight [(007 was
shot down on Aug. 31 nations around the
world imposed travel restrictions against
the Soviet Union in protest. How wili this
affect Grinnell College students traveling
to the Soviet Union?

First, Aeroflot, has not been allowed in
the United States since the invasion of
Afghanistan in 1979 This move did not stop
the students from going to the Soviet
Union. President Reagan has extended
that ban to travel agents who no longer can
book flights that connect with Aeroflot.

The Soviets have reacted to Reagan’s
move by voiding Aeroflot tickets printed in
the U,S., creating travel delays as new
tickets are printed up,

Ruth Anderson, a travel agent for the
Grinnell Travel Agency, said that tickets
to the Soviet Union may not be sold until
further notice. as directed by the Civil

Aeronautics Board. [Aeroﬂot offices in
New York and Washington, D.C. have been
closed, Andersonsaid.]

These changes will be of no concern to
Grinnell College students traveling to the
Soviet Union, said Russian professor John
Mohan, during an interview earlier this
week, The Grinnell students will be flying
to Helsinki, Finland, and taking a train

'from there to Moscow.

Mohan said that the studens will be
making two nights on Aeroflot inside the
Soviet Union which pose no logistical pro-
blem,

As a result of frequent tensions between
the two superpowers, Mohan said that
”whenver we plan a trip to the Soviet
Union we anticipate political ups and
downs might affect our plans." He was
confident the program would encounter nu
traveling difficulties,
