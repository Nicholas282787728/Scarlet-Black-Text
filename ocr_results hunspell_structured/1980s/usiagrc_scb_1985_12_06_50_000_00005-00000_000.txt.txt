Kathryn Mahrrmm o a college trustee and
while on mmpus /or the recent trustees
meeting, tallied tullh a group orstndenis about
a number 0/ osves. including the relationship
between liberal education and careers She is
currently Associate Dean of the College at
Brown University.

“Hello. son. how's the semester going?"

" ine. Dad. i got a B on my midterm in
history. And yesterday 1 iound the iorms to
register for second semester in my
mailbox Hard to believe it's time to do
ihat alreadyi "

"Well. lgot the bill from the Bursar's 0L
lice this week, ion. What are you going to
take in the spring?”

You begin to describe all the interesting
courses you've been thinking about. The
guy down the hall is taking semiotics this
semester and raves about the course; the
woman next door swears that geology is
absolutely iascinaiing. After hearing the
president announce the institute for Inter-
national Studies, you think you'd like to
find out if "Passage to India" really
describes the South Asian subcontinent
And then there's religious studies\
linguistics. biology. another semester oi
French.

Your lather

clears his throat and

mumbles “bursar” and "tuition” several .

times, Your mother breaks in and says
plaintively, ”But dear. you should take
something praciic "

Does this conversation sound familiar?
Hundreds oi students cxpericncc some
variation on this theme every semester.

parents that you may bc unemployed alter

The content approach produces few acc
ceptable courses _ accounting. . some
other economics courses. computer
science, engineering. the pl'e-med se-
quence. and math (because it's good [or
you). It's hard to argue that medieval
history has direct career valuc unless you
decide to get a PhD and become a
medieval historian.

But with a broader perspective you can
show that medieval history ior air
ihropology or phySICsl has both inhcrcnt
value and a career relationship; you can
enjoy the academic equivalent oi having

look beyond content to'scc whal else is go

Certainly you will need such skills in
whatever career you pursue aiter college.
Lawyers searching ior precedents. city
managers providing new mumcipal ser-
Vices, school principals developing new
high school graduation requirements all
must use every bit oi analytical ability
they have You will draw on those skills
irom your college education more than the
specific iacts irom your courses,

Yet another type ol perspective to
develop through your courses is a
disciplinary perspective A liberal educa
tion involves courses in a wide range oi
departments. but the goal should be more
than a smattering oi tools in many diir
ferent areas Different disciplines struc-
ture knowledge in lundamentally diiiereni
ways. looking at the natural world and the
human condition through different prisms.
What are the fundamental distinctions bet-
ween political science and economics,
semiotics and linguistics. math and ap
plied math‘! What questions do practir
lioners of these disciplines ask — and more
importantly. what do they not consider? It
you become a concentrator in philosophy
or biology or anthropology, what world
views are you implicitly accepting? How
will the structures of these disciplines in-
ilucnce the ways in which you do your job
aiter graduation?

Experiencing di/ferent modes 0/ learning.
Whatever your particular career turns out
to be. you know you will be expected to per
lorm many different duties A Careful
selection oi courses can provide a variety
oi learning styles which you can apply
later. Large lecture courses are usually
ilic most p‘ sire courses. but they also
develop skill , small seminars, on the
olher hand, require active participation in
discussion. creative thinking on the spot,
and sometimes leadership oi a class ses»
sion, Independent study demands respon-
sibility and selfrdiscipline lai‘ beyond that
required in a regular course.

Some courses are highly individualistic

- you go to clas .siudy alone. take exams.
nritc papers Others develop cooperative
or group skills. collaborative paper. a
team project Some courses are highly
theoretical while others have “rcal world"
applications as an integral part oi the
syllabus. Some are primarily analytical
Somé creative Other academic structures
allow you io got out oi college and observe
in local high schools. create an internship,
or analyze an agency of state government

These dllterenl styles of learning re
quire a range oi personal and intellectual
skills its well as determining which
abilities besl match which tasks. You will
draw upon all oi them in the next so years
ol your hie.

make your chowes for second semester

land every semesicrt in more
sophisticated ways. Really take l'esponr
silnliiy in your own education, And when
your parents call next iiinc. talk about
your education in new ways Remind thcm

that education is what you have lell over
