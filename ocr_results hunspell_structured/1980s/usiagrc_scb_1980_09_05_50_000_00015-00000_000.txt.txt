Religion attempts to correct problems

To Chris Barry. Columni :

Your concern with the application or
market economics to matters of salva-
tion is commendable, [$843. 89, 1] And
sarcasm. leveled at religious types who
cling desperately to a "HERE GUD»
ME FIRST, DAMMIT, I‘M FlRST!"
tyour phrase] attitude is more than
understandable.

i am not certain, however, that the
arrogance and nianipulativeness which
you protest is as pervasive as your arti-
cle might suggest. it is certainly a
grievous human lault which many new
and most all old religions attempt to
mend. it is a key result or personal
egocentrictty and corporate blindness,
Spirituality, in whatever religious
term, is an attempt to overcome this
condition, variously termed blindness.
arrogance, illusion, sclllshness, or
simply, sin. Thus, l lind it diiiicult to
accept your insinuation that greed and
selliimportance are "lundamental con-
cepts ot all the new religions (and a lot
oi the Old onesl.” It these tendencies
are so crucial, their primacy lies in the
fact that they have been designated
”the enemy."

PseudOrreliglon is capable of employ-
ing the power oi the enemy. Genuine
religion must always careiully watch
for these taults. Some wise guy once
said that halfrhearted faith is the devil‘s
own lavorite and lnost amusing
playmate.

Perhaps it will be ol some comlort to
you to know that a Palestinia

years ago. An account of this exchange
is preserved in Luke, chapter 14,
especially verses H4. I dislike quoting
scripture out 0t context, but it you ex»
amine the text. you \t'lll probably find,
among the salient points, the iollowing
line. “Everyone who exalts himsell Wlll

exploitation,
"When you give a party, ask the poor,
the crippled, the lame and the blind;
and so iind happiness. For they have no
means at repaying you; but you Will be
repaid on the day when good men rise
from the dead."7NeM English Bible,

It may be oi lurther comlort ior you

Episcopalians, and many Lutherans,
U.C,C.'S, Presbyterians and ,nther
religious types, have been scheduled to

religious obligation to read, mark,
learn and inwardly digest this passage.
And apply it to ourselves, At least until
such time as people begin rising trom

Barry column misleading

To the Editor:

Mr. Barry’s article, "Religion ior iun
and profit," is unclear and misleading
because he tails to ake the necessary
distinction between sible, formalize
ed religion" and “theistic philosophy."
ii the subject oi his writing is the
former, religion as an economic and
political magnitude, then some oi his
points are valid. For example,
hypocrisy and intolerance are
undeniably part oi today’s religion,
Since Mr. Barry uses Christianity as an
example throughout his article, I Will
do the same. It should be noted, then,
that it he intended to write about the
theistic philosophy, which is Christiani»
ty as it is presented in the Bible, then he
is wholly wrong.

His opening statement, “We all know
how born again Christians reel about
‘Radicals and Deviates,’ " besides be-
ing bland and unsupportable, is mean
ingless in terms of historical, biblical
Christianity: The Bible teaches that we
are all deviates from the heavenly
norm (Romans 3:23). [For this reason,
it can be understood why “religion" is

To the Editor:

One oi the most interesting aspects oi
Grinnell College is its misleading loca-
tion. Not many people know about lowa
and others have not heard of Grinnell,
even though it is a highly competitive
college. Unlike the East Coast, die
Midwest is not as widely recognized ior
its outstanding academics. Naturally,
this makes many highly qualitied
students reluctant to attend Grinnelll

Upon arrival at Grinnell, many new
students are surpri ed to hnd the col
lege equipped wi many advanced
features (Having only heard about the
cornfields, some new students are
amazed to see grass on the campus
groundsll). The situation improves as
students move into assigned rooms and
begin classes, Perhaps life, and
academic procedures are not complete»
ly diiierent irom what expectations had
been. An observation and realization is
made that the Grinnell Experience is
not genuinely atypical train that of
other colleges.

students have an incorrect conception

when Mr. Barry says it is wrong {or ,

religions to put words into peoples
mouths and predetermined concepts in-
to their minds,” I hope he is talking
about “religion" as I have defined it
and not about biblical doctrines or con-
cepts. otherwise, he is talking complete
nonsense. Once someone accepts the
Bible as divine revelation, he
recognizes its truth and authority, This ,
person has no choice but to accept these

predetermined concepts: This is true
tor Scripture in general to deny this is
nonsense

Iagree with Mr. Barry in that i wish
