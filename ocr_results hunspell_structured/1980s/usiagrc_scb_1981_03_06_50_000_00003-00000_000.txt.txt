Report condemns some SGA committees

by Bob Utke

The long awaited Study oi the Student
Government Committee structure was
distributed to Joint Board members
Wednesday, Feb. 25. The study,
prepared by Bob Kleine, was commis-
sioned in October, 1980, Kleme said the
study was requested because or a beliei
on JB that many of the committees
were not elicctive. He reported a
”general ieeling that the whole thing
istudent Government Associationl was
too big."

Kleine gathered his information from
members of last year‘s, '79'80, com-
mittees. He circulated a series at was
tionnaires to all oi last year's chairpeo
pie, many 01 the students who served
and some relevant members oi the ad
ministration, He received around 50
percent oi the questionnaires,

The report emphasizes "changing the
structure as a whole,“ Kleine stated.
He proposed that the Committee on Stu~
dent Lite tCSLl assume the respon~
sibility to decide each year lor which
committees there is a need. JB would
still be responsible [or appointing and
approving the student members to
these committees.

As a check on CSL's power, Kleine
suggests that JB have uie ability,
through a two-thirds majority vote, to
overrule any committee decision that
CSL might make. He expects that this
plan would eliminate extraneous and
ineffective committees .18 currently

appoints members to approximately 23
committees.

To clarify the need tor a structural
reorganization. the report assesses the
ell'ectiveness oi the committees, First,
the report suggests dial the Program in
Practical Political Education and
Public Events Committee be complete-
ly removed from the SGA. Kleine felt
that there is no real relationship bet
ween the purposes of either of these
committees and the purpose oi SGA.
These committees are capable or get-
ting their own student representation,

Inspiring some controversy, the
study advises that the tollowing coma
mittees be disbanded’ Admissions and
FinanCial Aid. the Committee on Corr
porate Responsibility and the PEC
Committee. Admissions and Financial
Aid is described as ineffective, Ques-
tionnaires irom last year's members
imply that students had no real input in
to the Admissions policies, The study
states, "At least without a committee
the Admissions Office will not be able to
yustiiy its policy because oi supposed
student government approval “

Kleine felt that the Cummittee for
Corporate Responsibility is maps
propriate lor SGA to continue,
However, Kleine is to keep track of the
school's investments. However, Kleine
asserted that it is not the responsibility
at the SGA to Speatsltnr the study body

in this situation. Anyone can obtain a
copy oi the school's holdings and when
a problem arises it can be better dealt
wtth by specific issue groups like the
South Airican Support Group.

The PEC Committee is an example of
overexpansion. its Job is to recom-
mend changes in the PEG. Kleine felt
that the lines of communication are
good enough in the PEG so that its
needs are recognized and met

The study judged the other commit-
tees ialrly eiiective Kleine especially
recognized the Committee on student
Lite, the Judicial Committee, the Food
Service Committee and the Housing
Committee [or their effectiveness and
eiiiciency.

Another change suggested in the
study was a rule requiring that JE apr
pomt all student committee positions by
iall break, This suggestion was
generated by a situation arising this
year in which no appomtments were
made until shortly belore winter break,
his report also advised developing two
year committee positions to lend
greater stability in the year to year
transitions.

SGA Cabinet members are said to be
looking over the report It is expected
that they will present their recommen-
dations to JB sometime alter spring
break,
