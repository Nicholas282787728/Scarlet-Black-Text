The world according

temperance

Student creates original fantasy game

At one time, a Bedouin mystic and his
iollowers swept up irom the desert and
quickly conquered much at the North.
However, disorganization and the im-
mensc coiiilict in cultures soon doomed the
empire to dismtegratlon. In “MegasRlsk
Tal," this ephemeral empire is
represented by the green circles which oc-
cupy a large portion oi the West. Mega-
Risk Tal is the game created by Mark

Lawrence. Basically, it is played like the .

board game “Risk," but it transcends the
pure regionalism oi Risk, reilecting an-
cient empires, political alliances,
economic leagues and religious affilia-
tions,

Lawrence mapped out his world during
fall break this year on three panels of
poster board. The somewhat unwieldy
board has 101 territories and almost as
many “conglomerates" which the multi
colored symbols in each territory repre-.
sent.

How to enjoy Gospel

Through all the sorrow oi the Sorrow
Song there breathes a hope 7 a faith
in the ultimate justice of things. The
minor cadences oi despair change
often to triumph and calm con-
fidence Sometimes it is faith in lifev
sometimes a faith in death,
sometimes assurance of boundless
justice in some lair world beyond
But whichever it is, the meaning. is
always clear; that sometimes,
somewhere, men will judge men by
their souls and not by their skins, IS
such a hope justified" Do the sorrow
songs sing true?
—W.E.B. Du Bois
On Nov. 28, 1981, in Herrick Chapel at 8
pm. The Young, Gifted and Black Gospel
Choir will present its annual Christmas
concert to the campus community. The
choir was officially formed in 1973 to
educate both the members of the choir and
the Grinnell College community on the
nature of Afro-American musical ex-
perience, The program will present songs
that are culturally signiiicant to black

The imaginary world that the board
replicates was familiar to Lawrence
already as the world that had evolved
through over two years oi playing another
iantasy game he invented, A friend who
created a medieval version of Risk supp
plied him with the idea oi transierring his
world to cardboard. ,'

The object or the game is to fulfill
destiny, ior eventually the entire world
should become one empire However, a
whole history oi empires and wars
preceeds the eventual outcome, The game
proceeds as one accumulates territories
and armies. A player receives extra are
mies for conglomerates which are
organizations oi territories based on
historical relationships,

or course, not all conglomerates are
equal in the amount oi extra armies they
accrue, For instance, in the West, there is
a fertile valley created by mountains to the
south and glaciers to the north. Because of

Americans Another purpose oi the
Christmas concert is to solicit funds for the
Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship Fund
The songs of the black Americans are
documents which tell of hope and despair,
Scholars have attempted to understand the
origin oi Aim-American music, and some
have reached the conclusion that the
spiritual is , , the music or an unhappy
people oi the children ct disappointment;
they tell of death and suffering and unvoic-
ed longing toward a truer world, at misty
wanderings and hidden ways.” other com
mentators have suggested that the distincr
tive music of the AfrosAmerican is a comp
bination oi European and Airican art
iorm, Sterling Brown writes that, "A give-
and~take seems logical to expect. Cor~
respondences between white and Negro
melodies have been established, The Come
plete Airicanism oi the spiritual was never
tenable. The spirituals are obviously not in
an African musical idiom, not even so
much as the music of Haiti, Cuba and
Brazil. But all of this does not establish the
Negro spiritual . as imitative oi white
music, or an unoriginal, or as devoid oi

delivers many armies to its lord. To the
north a mysterious nomadic people live in
the forbidding cold. territories are iar less
valuable and a drive to the south is a cons
tant strategy.

Conglomerates can also be spread out as
in the case or an economic league which
Lawrence compared to the lianseatic
league of medieval Europe. The strong
economicties and the spacing oithe varied
member territories make the con-
glomerate hoth valuable and diiiicutt to re-
tain.

Lawrence stressed that the game is not
as complicated as it appears. ”It can be a
very loud, rowdy competitive game. Most
people have already played the game that
l got this irom and know most oi the pre-
history They know the game almost as

debate among musical scholars and

and Melville Herskovitz has revealed the

when listening to The Young, Giited and

that the words are only one part oi the total
musical experience. John Lovell Jr. has
written that “through the revelations pro-
duced by anthropology, it thus becomes
clear that the words oi a iolk song cannot
be read with simple literalness. The song
creator is aware that his iolk have ir»
repressible drives and deep ieelings that
words can signiiy but not iully express. To
appreciate the style and diversity at the
Negro song, one must understand the cone
text in which the bards were created."

The game deviates in a lew more ways
irom its parent Risk. One way is'that many
oi the conglomerates overlap so competir
tioii to retain your conglomerates and deny
them to others is: a constant themel A150,
players can enter into iormal, signed
alliances; noncompliance is severely
punished Finally, as Lawrence pointed
out, it diiiers in a most interesting way
“You get a good sense oi your own proper-
ty ~ you really feel like ‘I am the Lord Of
Shallah.‘ it gets to the point people will
declare world peace rather than iight it out
and destroy their lands, Alter a game we‘ll
usually Sit around for awhile and discuss
the game, what we should have done. It's a
lot like chess It's not just simple power
grabbing " ,

One problem Lawrence has found IS that
people keep trying to invent new rules.
usually to their advantage. He is determln~
ed, though, to keep this iantasy world
