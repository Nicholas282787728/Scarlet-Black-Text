ing and irrational dieting are of-

lifestyle of a person who falls
victim to an eating disorder,
be it anorexia nervosa or b...

obsessed witl. food and believe
that food is the only thing they
can really control. people af-
iiictcd witll an eating disorder
.rse that “power" to ﬁght emo-
tional instability, stress, and re.
ality without realizing that their
weapon could kill them as well.

According to the “Diagnostic
Statistics Manual Ill," a psy»
chiatric journal, anorexia n
vosa is diagnosed when a min.
inunn 25 percent of the ideal
body weight is lost clue to con-
sistent refusal and avoidance of
food, irl combination with exces-
sive exercise, selfsillduced vomits
ing, and abuse or laxatives and
diuretics, Anorexics ofteir hide
food tllat they claim they will
eat later. Ill 3 sit-down illeal sits
uatioil, an anorexic oftell plays
witll his or her food and may
eirgage in ritualistic acts such
as taking a very small bite and
chewing it a speciﬁc number of
times. It is also very coininoi.
for an anorexic to study llllll’ir
tioll and prepare very elaborate
meal but not eat ally of tllelii

The DSM lII lists several lelr
plications resulting from ioss of
body fat and nutrients These
coirrplications include ainenor-
lllea, a condition which causes
women to have irregular inelw
strualion cycles (this is also
common among women oth.
letes); reduced heart and other
muscle tissue, much of which
is irreplaceable; hypothermia;
hypertension; irregular sleeping
patterns; loss of bowel control;
and loss or electrolytes, which

the. brain 10 to 21 percent of
diagnosed cases ternrinate with
death, usually due to related
complications rather than star-
vation. “It‘s selfsabusive behav-
ior,"
says Cindy Mueller, women‘s
volleyball and swimming coach.

Anorexics are extremely dif
ficult to treat because they
emphatically deny having airy
problem. Because anorexia is of-
ten or cyclic disorder that typ
ically does not go away by it-
self, professional treatment is re-
quired for complete recovery.

The irrost distinguishing char-
acteristic of bulimia, ofteil called
the binge—purge cycle, is that
its victims are ofnornlal weight.
These people, in contrast to
anorexics, are aware oftlleir dis
order and although they know
that it is not normal, they fear
stopping the cycle will leave
them without anything to cling
to, without anytllllg that they

can control. “It‘s a way to get
control in a tamily that's out or
control, or a society that‘s out of
control," says Lisa Bard, a couri-
selor at Grirlrlell Mental Health
Center, “They‘re doing what
they want to, and they believe
it works for them."

During a binge, a bulimic
consumes enormous amounts of
lligllrcaloric foods that require
little chewing. Binges are us...
ally planned and, if not ill-
terrupted by social interven-
tioir, a biilger will eat until lite
erally iorcecl to stop because
of abdominal pain, and then
will relieve himself or herself of
the intense discoiurort by purg-
ing. Purging can be achieved
through a combination of self-
iird..cecl vomiting, excessive cx.
ercise, and abuse of laxatives
and diuretics,

Coach Mueller says that “atlls
letics is a good way of cov.
eriirg it [binging and purging]
up.” All episode of binging
aild prrrging may span several
hours yet remain unsuspected
by friends and families due to
secrecy and involved planning.
The consequences or bulimia are
emotional and physical. The
frequent vomiting carrscs bad
breath, stailled teeth, thoracic
corrosion, callrrses oi. the back
of the hands, and electrolyte de-
ﬁciencies. Because briliinics are
emotionally unstable, they orten
become introverted and are all a
high risk {or suicide.

Bulimia and anorexia have
many similarities and often are
c... together According to
Donna Bailey, the director of
health services at Grillilell, dings
noses of thc two disoi-rleis were
cornbrued in the past and b...
liinia was irot rccagnized as a
separatc disorder, “It's an 805
disorder," says Bailey. The on.
set for both disorders is usually
iil late adolescence and all es-
tiriiated 98 percent of victims
are women. Common char-
acteristics include extreme se-
crecy, depression, an obsession
with weight, and a distorted
body image. it is irot sure
prising that people with eat-
ing disorders are also periectioir
ists, and they typically do very
well ill school. Because victiills
tend to worsen under stressful
conditions, adolescents and cola
legke students are at considerable
rls .

town Often, according to Lisa
Bard and Julie Fraser, a resi»
dent adviser, people with cat
ing disorders or. cairiprrs get
into treatment programs either
through their own initiative, or
by asking for help with some
other problem like stress inau-

ageliiellt or depression, when
the underlying problem is with
food. “Food in general is a
problem for most women," said
Fraser Donna Bailey helps and
monitors several students with
a doctor's order and students
who place a voluntary request.
“They deal with deﬁnite diag.
nosed cases rather than people
who come off the street," says
Bailey. “Eating disorders are a
inanirestation of air underlying
problcni...they are a problem

There are iro current statistics

orders on this campus. “It is
all underground kind of thing,"
says Bard. “Stress is a culprit,“
believes Bailey.

Fraser and Mueller agree tllat

Now, Bard sees more students
