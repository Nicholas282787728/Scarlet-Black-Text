“It was a great way to end the
season, " said a happy Coach Gar
Smith after his team whipped Coe,
93790, last Friday in their final
game of the season.

This was their fth victory in
seven games gi ng them an
overall record of 6-16 and a con-
ference mark 3-11.

Playing before a packed house,
the Pioneers grabbed an early
lead and extended it to 44-30 at the
halt. Midway through the second
half. the lead was Stretched to
6948; a 21 point difference.

“The crowd was really behind
us, the atmosphere was very elec~

playing excellent basketball,"
This may be the understatement
of the year by Coach Smith. The
fans and team were treated to

a pleasant surprise, an incognito
pep-band, whose names we rounds
ed up: Todd Q. Mclntire, Byron
Ricks, Tim Black, Ted Mansuego
and Bill Gottdiener.

The highlights of their perfor-
mance were an Honor “G" during
the halftime show and a rendition
of “If You Can't G0 to College Go
To Coe" (to the tune of “If You’re
Happy and You Know It").

Then came the turning point in
the game. With only ten minutes
showing on the clock, and a
‘Kohawk’ threatening to close the
desperate 20-point gap with a
single freethrow, Steve Galsoer
chose the only option left. He was
quoted as saying. “Sometimes a
man gotta do, what a man gotta
do," and he did.

Galster loosed the string on his
shorts and with one swift motion
dropped and flung his trunks to
the crowd. This move so
frustrated and stymied the Coe
sideline that they lost sense of pur-
pose and direction, Callapsed in

Six records fall

indoors

By Scott Hiiduia

last Saturday, February 18th,
Grinnell’s Indoor Track Team
hosted it's biggest meet in PEC
history. From all corners of Iowa
came the 150 or so competitors for
some very exciting sweating
under the flat-top, At the end of a
long day of competition, the
women Pioneers placed a Close se-
cond no national power Central
College while the men took a
disappointing fourth place.

While neither team took first,
the PRC saw six school records
fall as the Pioneers hinted at
future Success in the ouu‘loor
season. Both the men’s and the
women's teams set new marks in
the 4x880 relays; the women's new
time shaved a whopping do
seconds off the old.

In the grueling hal[»mile,
freshman Jennifer Bishop showed
great promise, turning in a record
performance of .24.7. The
women's triple jump, in its in-
augural season, saw a powerful
3110" School mark from hris
Lawson, another promi ng
rookie.

Jon Maron, team captain and
inspirational leader, turned in a
stunning double.album breaker
with a 52.05 flash in the.quarter
mile and a high jump of 6‘55”.

Both are also PEC building
records.

Danielle Walker, sophomore
sprinter, and Maron were elected
meet-MVP'S by the coaches of all
teams participating in the meet.

Coach Will Freeman predicts a
potentially fruitful Saturday for;
the Pioneers as they make their,i
way for a second time to Wart»
burg College. “The track at WartJ
burg is even faster than the one
here so we’re looking for some im-
proved performances this
weekend”. said Freeman.

The Pioneers are very familiar
with both the teams that they will
be facing at the Wartburg track.
Freeman also said that me team
is still building toward the indoor
season finale in Chicago on March
2nd, the Midwest Conference
meet.

Last year at the conference
meet, the women Pioneers placed
2nd out of six teams while the men
took a fourth out of eleven team
finish.

followed by Cornell, with 13, and
