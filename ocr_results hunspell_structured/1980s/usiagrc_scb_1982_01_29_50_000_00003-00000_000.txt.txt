Bahais sponsor information tables
Hope to generate sympathy for Iranian counterparts

by laura Schaetei

As a new spring semester begins, Quad
and Cowles' diners once again encounter
eager people seated behind tables loaded
with pamphlets, There always seems to be
some ”worthy Cause" for Grinnell
students to participate in, This week‘s
table, however, is different, There is no
petition to sign and no donation box, In-
stead. there are two or three members of
the Bahai faith sitting behind a table to
answer any questions one might have,

The Bahais wish to inform Grinnell Col»
lege students of the situation in Iran Iran
nian Bahais have been persecuted since
l8“ when the faith began. In the first few
years 20.000 Bahais were slaughtered
Recently, the lranian government an-
nounced that they are issuing passes that
must he used to purchase goods, The
Bahais will not receive these passes In
other words. the Bahais in Iran are in
danger of extinction because they cannot
purchase food and they are not allowed to
leave the country

Cindi Chessick. head of the Grinnell.

Bahal Chapter. noted that many people

Jim Work heads Summer Programs

sympathize with the Bahais but they ieel
inadequate in their ability to help
Chessick emphasized that speaking out is
one oi the main answers to the problem
"At least then there is a chance that
something will change. Silence gets
nothing done; the innocent die and are
forgotten."

For anyone who wants to do something
immediately for the Iranian Bahais.
Chessick suggests writing one's Con-
gressman. in February, the u 5. Congress
will hold a hearing on religious persecution
and ii Congressmen know that people who
vote are concerned about this issue they
are more likely to get something positive
done

“The Bahais are a peaceful religious
group," chessick explained, They iollow
the writings and ideas oi two prophets
The Bab and Baha-lu‘llah, The word Bahai
is derived from these two names and
means the iollowers oi glory. light and
splendor The Bahais have 12 basic prins
ciples which include equality [or all. and
the oneness of God, religion and mankind.

Chessick stated that the Bahais seek world
peace. ”We want a reconciliation of all
religions and cultures to unite in one
human race." she said.

Generally. Grinnell Bahais as a group
are not politically active. ilowever.
because Grinnell Bahais ieel their iellow
Bahais are poorly treated in Iran. they are
attempting to intorm Grinnell students
about the situation The iniormation tables
contain magazine articles and a plea irom
Chessick ior Grinnell students to get in
volved. The Bahais also staged a letter
writing campaign on Thursday, Jan 23.
The purpose, according to Chessick. was to
“awaken our Congressmen to the issue."

The Grinnell Bahais spend time studying
their iaith among themselves and with
other lowa college chapters. Chessick ex-
plained. "The Grinnell Bahai Chapter is
not just another progressive group We
deiiniteiy are religious but we're not a
solemn group " The Bahais urge anyone
who wants iniormation to come Thursday

Grinnell programs, outside groups to use campus

by Laura Carter

After receiving the go-ahead on a sumr
mer use proposal irom the Board oi
Trustees at its tail meeting, the Summer
programs oiiice has opened under the
direction of Jim Work. Grinnell's newest
administrator comes here irom Min~
rlesota. where he served as the assistant
director oi College Relations and coor-
dinator oi Summer Conterences at
Carleton College and as a member oi the
DemocratiC»Farmer»Labor Party state
Executive Committee.

Work began Jan 4 coordinating the two
iold operation oi the new program irom his
temporary office in the Physical Plant
Helping him is Coordinator oi College Ser-
Vice Norma Gosselink and another assis-
tant may be hired this summer, students
may be hired in the luture ior-various
duties The iirst dart oi their rcsponr
sibilities is to work with the faculty and ad
ministration in developing "Grinnelr
sponsored academicctype" projects that
,will iocus on bringing high school students
and teachers to campus during the sums
mer. These projects will involve those
iaculty members who volunteer. although
they will be paid. ”I‘m not going to dictate
the content." said Work “The ideas will be
a two-way street."

Two ideas have already been suggested
tor Grinnell summer programs A three»
week writing program designed primarily
for high school juniors and teachers would
be successful here. Work said, because a
“higher percentage of noannglish faculty
members" teach writing. Such a workshop
would also accommodate the emphasis
now being placed on basic skills in schools
due to widespread cuts in public education
funds. A “computer camp" is another

possibility and would also supplement
costly high school programs. According to
Work, “Grinnell. compared to other
private, liberal arts colleges. has incredi-
ble computer facilities."

Work will recruit groups to use
Grinnell's iacillties in two ways. First he
must “get the word out that we‘re accepr
ting," he said. “But you must be subtle.

don't look desperate " The success oi
previous programs will also spread by
word oi mouth and encourage more
organizations to come

The purpose or Summer Programs. said
President Drake in the Oct. ‘50, 1981 8&3. is
to improve the recognition. image and
general standing or the college in Iowa and
ultimately. the admissions process and
numbers, Yel Work acknowledged.
"There's a reluctance on Campuses to use
the idea of marketing. We won't be
pushing the college on ithe groupsi v'iile
they‘re here The college is going to speak
ior itself.“ The only public relations ser-
vice the college plans to include in its
materials for outside groups are the hours
of the Admissions and Financial Aid Ofs
rice. which will be printed on a pamphlet
with a map

Another purpose. although described as
secondary. is to increase the college's
revenue. Work labeled Summer Programs
as a “revenue-generated" operation that

director oi the new program. Grinnell has
an "absolutely periect location" ior this
use The college is within a s hour drive
oi most major midwcstern cities and the
area could supply many participants for
Grinnellrsponsored and outside group pres
jects. The Iowa United Church of Christ is
already scheduled to be on campus this
summer

The Summer programs administration
will reserve the right to deny use oi Grinr
nell facilities to any group, however. Work
described his policy ior deciding what
organizations may he on campus as "Wide
open. within reason " One way to
discourage a group irom coming would be
to charge it an extraordinarily high fee. he
said. Work added. “If students ielt a group
was dctrimcntal to Grinnell's image. | they
shouldl go to everyone lln the college ad
mlnlstratlonl and hit them with it,“

The campus has many selling points
which would encourage organizations to

they’re here. The college is going to

speak for itself. ”

 

will have a "Dreakreven philosophy‘ lt
will earn money from the fees charged
each group and irom private grants lie
ruled out the possibility oi public monies,
The use oi any proiits that might be earned
will be up to the college but Summer Proc
grams must iunction as an “auxiliary
enterprise" to maintain Grinnell‘s tax
exempt status

The other half of Works responsibilities
is to recruit outside groups to come to the
campus and use Grinnell's facilities for
their own workshops. According to the

come to Grinnell. according to Work, The
major plusses on campus, he listed. are
the renovated dorm rooms, the "ins
credibly adaptable" lounges. the high
classroomrtocbedroom ratio and Roberts
Theater. The PEC, which he called “ab-
solutely above par oi anything I've seen."
and the “flexible" Food Service operation
are other Grinnell advantages. In order to
