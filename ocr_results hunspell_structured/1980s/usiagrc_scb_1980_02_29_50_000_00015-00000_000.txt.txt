ormally. a speaker coming to Grin-
ell is paid for travel expenses plus an
onorarium sometimes as hilzh as

nut often several hundred dollars is
upplied by the SGA.

If you were aware that the plane

I find it strange that you consider
he use of properly appropriated

owever, your comment about Mr.

oyer judging “a perverse Gong

Show" reveals your misinformation on
this point as well You also seem to be
uninformed as to the condition of the
MinisGl'ant program According to the
SGA VicerPresldent, the MinisGrant
program this semester is far from ails
ing: in fact, there have been no Minis
Grants given out this semester.

As for the Relays itself, if you, as an
upper classman, [sic] feel that Mr.
Meyer attends only for his personal
benefit so that he can “drink beer”
and “yell alot.” [sic] I feel very sorry
for you The purpose of the Grinnell
Rclays, since its inception eight years
ago, has been to further the building
of a community spirit at Grinnell and
functlon as a tension releaser before
finals.

Now’ lor my “pet peeve,” l have
previously thought the editorial sec
tion of the 5&8 to be the Voice of the
student body, I was appalled when I
read the personal nature of your
editorial. In the last issue, the
editorial pagc oi the 3&3 became a
forum for the editor to express
unresearched opinions. I feel confident
in this appraisal, since at no point
before writing your editorial did you
contact any member of the Grinnell
Relays Committee,

Unfortunately, however, I must cons
gradulate [sic] you. Your editorial has
had lts desired en‘ect. Due to your
shabby yellow journalistic editorial
and the selfsrighteousness of a small
group of individuals, Mr. Moyer will
not be attending the Grinnell Relays.
He wishes to create no hard feellngs
toward the Relays, or himself, by any
campus faction, no matter how small.

axtigates 3&1} for releasing election results

To the Editor: Iwas extremely
pset last week by the sea and
DIC’S coverage of the abortive SGA
‘resldential election. Both publicized
he results of the election, which was
nectared “null and void” by the Elecs
ion Board. Isn‘t this defeating the en
ire purpose of voiding the election?
he whole point is that these results
ere unreliable, biased and inac-
uratc. Election rules were
iolatedimore people voted than
here were ID numbers Checked off.
y publicizing the results, the second
lection may well have been influenc-
d in many difterent ways. Thus, the
rue results are now obscured by the
8:3 and KDIC's irresponsibility.
There are extenuating cir-
umstances for KDIC—they announc-
d the results at first before the 9160
tion was voided, However this points
to another culpritithe Election Board
itself. There needs to be a period of
time so grievances can be filed and
dealt with before election results are
let out, This reform needs to be in
stituted to prevent future fiascos like
this one.

though. There was plenty of time to
hear the election had been nullified
and therefore kill the figures. In fact,
this is what the Election Board tried
to get the 5&8 (Namely Chief Editor
Andrew Schultz) to do, But no, the

The editor replies: Mr Secoy’s
knowledge of journalistic and ethical
standards seems quite shallow. The
duty of the press, here and in the real
world, is to provide for the public
what it has the right to know. It is not
the job or the press to satisfy the
schizophrenic desires of any political
agency or individual.

An election was held: the results of

I still feel, despite your attempts,
that this year's Relays will be the best

port of the entire campus community

The editor replies: if the informa. _

hand, then I don't know what a juure l _
nalist is to do. I was not informed
about the lectures, and this is not how
the expenditure was represented, even ;
by those in direct contact with Prof.
Moyer. Mr. Leif himself represented _ ',
the allotment only as a travel expense ‘
and not as a lecture lee. That these
proposed lectures would have concur-
red with Relays Weekend was of
course intentional. Istand by the
editorial and my contention that a pro:
lessor should not receive student , ,
money for transportation and to ends
that are fundamentally non-academic i
in scope. The idea that Prof. Moyer
would come here primarily for lec-
tures is dubious and rings of comm
tee afterthought: an attempt to justify
a questionable expenditure,

The idea that a conspiracy exists to '
undermine the Relays is quite hyperv
bollc,

it anyone is at fault for creating
hard feelings about this escapade, it is
Mr. Left and the Relays Committee, ,
inasmuch as they are responsible for

failure is indicative of the ' V
translucence of its purpose.

the election were announced; these
results were broadcast over KDIC at .
least three times before the 5828 came
out. '

The Election Board‘s and Mr.

Secoy‘s contention that releasing the
results would somehow bias the sea
cond election has not been borne outlin'
the resulb of the second election, ‘ ‘
These second results were not ‘
significantly different from the
first—the same people won, and by , -
about the same numbers.

A second contention that releasing
the results would harm the possibility - -
of recreating uie “atmosphere of ig-
norance” prior to an election is also
untenable. Once the candidates know
the results, word spreads ﬁlrough the '
usual channels. Surely Mr. Secoy
could not expect a candidate who lost
or won by only one vote not to regroup
his/her campaign accordingly. In
other words, it is impossible to keep
such results secret, and pointless as
well.

Finally, the SGA acted Wednesday ,
upon a proposal to reprimand the 55:13 ’
for publishing the election results. The I
proposal was resoundingly defeated.
