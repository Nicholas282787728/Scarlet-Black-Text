The Academic Wringer
Faculty aware of pressure

by Joe Nari

(Second of a series)

Last week we looked at the unusual lei/ck 0/
stress that seemed to be ﬂf/Ecllrtg students dur-
ing the 1982 fall semester. In this, the second of
u ﬁveparl series, we will look at how professors
make up their workloads, what they expect
from their students and what they think of
academic pressure and szrcrs. We talked with
three professors: Kenneth Christmnsen, pm
lessor of biolog , Robert Grey, professor of
political science; and Ll'nhmz Bnbener, pro/255m
of American studies and English.

One of the obvious causa of stress for
any college student is that of getting the
assigned work Completed on time and with
the highest quality. At Grinnell me typical
workload is four classes, usually a couple
of science coursa. a humanities course
and a social science course. But if we are
looking at academic studies as one of the
factors of stress, the question should be
asked: how much work is too much’!

Each of the professors interviewed
remarked that when deciding upon the
workload for their classes, t ey loosely
follow the old adage oi giving two hours of
preparatory work for every hour of class.
but that this rule of thumb was by no
means set in stone. Many of the courses
that a professor teaches have me same
syllabil year after year, but the professors
were in agreement that they continually
evaluate, both formally and informally,
whether their students are grasping the
material.

It is not unreasonable for a professor to
delay or even cancel readings because his
or her class is spending more time on
materials than was expected. Grey
remarked that it was not unusual to
postpone readings or papers because his
class was not moving as quickly as he ex-
pected, He also explained that sometimes
he delayed readings because the class was
discussing the material at a deeper level
than expected, which always takes more
time.

when planning a new course, Chris-
tiansen said that he looks at the come
prehensive materials for the specific sub-
ject and at what students can reasonably

 

be expected to learn. The length of his
assignments varies with the difficulty of
the work.

Christiansen explained that there are a
variety of tools with which a protusor can
gauge how well his students are doing, in-
cluding direct feedback from studens, ex-
aminations, exercisﬁ and end of the
course evaluations. He suggested that,
“Over the years a professor develops a set
of criteria with which to evaluate a
workload."

Babener consciously attempts to relieve
pressure when creating a workload. She
tries to alternate short and long readings
so mat the level of analysis [or the
readings change, creating what Babener
terms “natural peaks and valleys” for
students.

For Babener, the challenge in devising a
workload is to give the most challenging
and interesting assignments without
overloading the student. She remarked
that, “Thedgoal of an assignment is not to
bury a Stu cut but to intrigue!” Babenel'
finds that students are very conscious of
unchallenging and mundane assignments,

Her goal is to match studens’ commit-
ment to learn with the same enthuSIastic
commitment to teach. “I love the assign
ment that sparks students to be exciting
and to assume creative responsibilityl"
Babener expressed her opinion that in-
teresting and challenging work will be
done with more speed and less pressure
than something uninteresting to the stun
dent.

Each of the professors hold a somewhat
different opinion of the causes of stress in
students’ lives. Christiansen feels that the
pressures which studenw experience are
internally generated. He believes that put
ting pressure on oneself is somewhat of a
tradition at Grinnell.‘

Chrlstiansen recalls that in the fifties the
college reduced the full load of classes
from five to four in order to reduce the
pressure on students. He Said, “It worked
for a couple of years, and then the students
were right back under pressure again!”
He maintains that professors can get a lot

 

 

 

 

out of students because of the type of
students Grinnell attracts, saying, ”Let‘s
face it , this is not exactly the best place for
a partyer!”

Grey feels that students even take a
perverse pride in the amount of work they
are assigned and can accomplish. Grey
remarked that Grinnell has an ethos of
“working hard and taking pride in
academics.” Grey also sees a process by
which students adopt this ethos.

Babener expressed a view similar to
Grey's when she remarked, “One of the
myths at Grinnell is this sense of organic
success and a commitment to learning.”
Babener feels that excessive pressure is
unnecessary and selfrdestructive, but that
certain pressures help students to strive to
do their best and to learn their limiwtions.

Babener summed up her feelings in say
ing, “That's what a liberal arts education
ls; it teaches students, to quote Hem-
ingway, “Grace under pressure."

Purim

by Robert Valenti

The first celebration of Purim’in several .

years at Grinnell will take place this Satur-
day in Gardner Lounge. “Great," you may
say. “But what is Purim?"
This ancient Jewish holiday is an annual
_ commemoration of the victory of the Jews
over a would-be murderer about 2300 years
agn. The word “purim” means “lots” in
Hebrew and indicates how Haman, the evil
minister of Persian King Ahasuerus, set
the day for the extermination of the Jews
in Persia. The tale of Purim tells of how
' Queen Esther, a Jew, managed to tum the
will of _ the King against Haman, thus

preventing the genocideof the Jewish pet}.

pie in that kingdom.

The event is traditionally celebrated by
a festival usually held in late winter, which
is what will take place this Saturday even-
ing from 10 pm. to 1 am. in Gardner
Lounge. In accordance with the ancient
style, the practice of giving gifts to friends,
charity, parading and heavy drinking will
all be followed at the party. There will also
be helium balloons. wine, punch, veggie
dip and hamantachen (cookies, literally
“Hamans ear‘s”). The wearing of
costumes is encouraged.

There will be music, but according to
Ellen Tachau, party organizer, it will be
played much more softly than usual. ”This

_ party will be qualitatively different from
other all—campus partles. It will be lower
key and hopefully more festive and friend-

 

jewelry. All three academic diviSlons and
nearly every department at Grinnell will
be represented.

Choosing from among 115 submitted an
ticles was what Editor Beth Vilen called
“a very selective process." Decisions on

party for fun

ly." The members of Chalutzim, the
Jewish group on campus, hope that they
will be able to expose Grinnell students to
a holiday which is specificallyvoriented to
having fun. , '

The festival will be followed on Sunday
by a reading of the megillah (storyi of
Purim from the book of Esther in Main
Lounge, beginning at to a.m. This unique
opportunity to experience this aspect of
the Jewish culture is open to all who are in-
terested. The traditional booing of Human
will be encouraged, and noisemakers,
bagels and cream cheese will be provided
free of charge by Chalutzim.

According to Ilene Weismehl, a
freshman who is coordinator of the event,
“People are very enthusiastic about the
Jewish group.“ This seems to be the opi-
nion of many members of the group, whose
activities this year have included frequent
Shabbat dinners and parties.

Tachau stated that ﬁle Jewish group has
been revitalized this year. “It's hardto be
Jewish at Grinnell, because you'll offend a
lot of people. There are so many ideas of
what it means to be a Jew. There are even
different ideas of what Purim means."

Tachau says that the group is larger this
year than in previous years and has grown
in hothsize and spirit. ‘fThis Purim'party
is in a way a celebratio of that too,“ she
concluded.

content were made by students who mar
jored in or were otherwise knowledgeable
about the particular subject matter.

Vilen expects this year‘s book to be “at
least as good. if not better” than last
year’s first edition of the Review. She cited
a more professional format and added at-
tention to small details as areas of im-
provement.

The Review's board has changed
publishers and thus expects none oi the
delivery delays that were a problem last
year. The board has also met every
deadline to date.

One thousand copies of the Review will
be printed. So far student subscriptions to
the Review total about 50 and parent alum-
ni subscriptions about l30.

Last year’s Review had about 400
subscribers, a number the board hopes to
match this year. The subscription drive,
which has not yet begun in earnest, will
pick up before spring break.

The Review Sells for $4 to students and $7
to alumni and parents. The remaining cost
of each $10 book and other items in the
Reviews some budget come from SGA, the
Rosenfield Program for Public Affairs,
President Drake’s special fund and
business donations.

Currently sponsored by Mortar Board.
the Grinnell Review is under the Student
Publications and Radio Committee’s
jurisdiction. The Staff of the Review hopes
one day to have the standing other campus
media enjoy. but that goal “will take a lot
of student support,” says Vilen.

Vilen says the book is “a really good deal
at $4" and expects students to "enjoy see
ing what their peers are doing here at
Grinnell,” She sees the Review as a wor-
thy endeavor to support and emphasues
the need for people to staff next year’s
journal,
