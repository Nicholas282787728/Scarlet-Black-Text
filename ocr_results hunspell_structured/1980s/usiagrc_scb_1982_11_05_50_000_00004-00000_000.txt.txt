Resisters deserve
our praise . not
prosecution

Recently two Iowa men have been indicted by federal grand juries for
failing to register for the draft. They are Rusty Martin, president of the
University of Northern Iowa student body, and Gary Eklund, a resident
of Davenport. In refusing to register for the draft these men are breaks
ing the law, but those of us who want to avoid the United States’ involve
ment in another war and who would not want to participate in a war
should appreciate what they are doing.

By taking such a stand Martin, Eklund and other public resisters
around the country focus our attention on the draft registration issue.
They are protesting what they feel is an unjust law and hopefully the
rest of us will realize that fact, also. To quote a flier printed by the Com-
mittee Against Registration and the Draft, “The draft is a basic viola-
tion of freedom. It allows thegovernment to take control of individual
lives and force them into a war."

Although some people say they do not agree with the law itself, they
feel because it is a law that every male born since 1960 must sign up
within 30 days of his 18th birthday, it should be followed to the letter, or
number as the case may be. But it seems wrong that if a person
disagrees with a law for moral reasons he should not take a moral stand
on refusing to comply with the law. Civil disobedience has proven very
effective in the past as a means of changing unjust rules. Martin Luther
King and Mahatma Ghandi, among others, used this method.

The draft registration law also discriminates against men, And what
does this law say about the government’s opinions of women? Why
relegate women to staying home while the men are drafted'.7 If the draft
ever is necessary it might help morale if both sexes have to serve — sort
of the united effort idea.

Another argument for registering is that it does not necessarily mean
you will fight or that the draft will ever be put into effect. However, the
government would not have instituted the registration if it did not think
it might have to use those names. If the U.S. were involved in a
“justified" war it wouldn’t need to force people to join the armed ser-
vices. Plenty of people would volunteer — if this country’s citizens felt
the war was merited. The draft is only to get people to fight in a war they
do not think they ought to be in.

All of this argument about justified and unjustified wars is precluded
by the fact that the next major conflict will probably be a nuclear battle.
What person in his right mind wants to have anything to do with a
nuclear war, whether he fights in it or merely supports it by registering
his name for service in it“! This point is another reason why me resisters
ought to be commended. They are refusing to support a military system
which has the potential to incur major world destruction.

Enforcing the law is impossible, There are approximately 500,000
draft resisters nationwide and the courts cannot handle that volume of
cases in addition to what they already have. Only the resisters who have
made their inaction public are being prosecuted. Presumably these few
will serve as as example to the others who have not signed up, and to
future resisters, to make them register. However, The Des Moines
Register reported in its Oct. 17 issue that in Iowa there has not been a
general increase in registration. In fact, postal officials all over the
country have reported no increase.

We are not suggesting that all young men should refuse to register for
the draft. That is, of course, an individual decision. But those who do
should receive more support and appreciation for taking a stand against
a law which is unnecessary and very possibly dangerous.

ls bigotry a Grinnell tra-

From the American Heritage Dictionary:
liberal. 2, having, expressing or following views
or policies that favor the freedom oflridioidoob
to act or express themselves in a manncr of
thlrowrt choosing a Tolerant ofthe ideas or
behavior of others Bigot. A person of strong
conviction or prejudice, especially in matters c/
religion, nice or politics, who is intolerant to
those who diffzr with him.

I was in the Post Office getting my mail
when a member oi one or Grinnell’s
political organizations asked me to read a
petition, This person had asked me earlier
to sign the petition and I had rciuscd, This
time they simply wanted me to read the
statement. I did so and once again explain
ed that I wasn’t going to sign it. When ask-
ed why, I explained that although I agreed
with aspects oi the group's intentions, the
wording oi the petition did not voice my
opinions on the issuc What followed was a
subtle yet potent example oi bigotry ,
Grinnell style.

As I began discussing tlle issue of Sign-
ing the petition with two other members oi
the group, i was drilled on the nature oimy
beliefs, which I certainly didn't mind, I ex7
plained that ii I sign a petition, it is
because the petition accurately describes
my feelings on an issue. They explained
the point of the petition was to send a
message oi concern, I pointed out that in
addition to voicing concern the petition

When I arrived here as a freshman I was
told that there were two exceptional par
ties on campus: the international
Student's Party and the Grinnell College
Gay Community’s Halloween Party. Opi»
nions of this kind are purely subjective;
however, there has been a steady conscn-
sus during my four years here that these
two groups throw great parties. The only
thing that has changed, and changed
drastically in the last two years, is the
degree of homphobia and thc overtly
malicmus turn it has taken.

Last year Younkers Hall spearheaded
an “alternative party" that coincided With
GCGC'S Halloween Party, The Younkers
party was conceived in fear, belligerence,
distrust and the erroneous idea that GCGC
was “up to something " Neither GCGC nor
the Younkers homophobes have to justify
what they are doing; ococ is trying to
develop a higher level of understanding
and acceptance in the community, while
Younkel‘s is offering an alternative for
those who are unwilling or unable to recon-
cile themselves to the rest oi the popula-
tion. If the homophohes want to throw their
own party concurrent to the ococ, then
perhaps they should, Intolerance to others
and self-righteousness is no ti what the Gay
Rights movement is about; such postures
are better suited to other groups and
movements. '

Animosity towards the GCGC party, or
more appropriately to the organization
directly, is running higher this year than in
past years, It was our original intention to
place 12 posters in areas where the cam-
pus community would see them regularly
rather than wasting paper, energy, money
and time plastering the campus. The signs
were quite attractive, but I doubt you saw
them; after 12 hours only three were left,
the other nine had been destroyed. One of
the three was left in the Post Office. After
12 hours the words QUEERS and FAG-
GOTS had been scrawled over it; after 16
hours someone had ripped it up and put it
in a scrap paper bin. ’

Before we start on a tirade about the hal-
cyon days oi Grinnell when such in-
tolerance would not have been allowed,
please remember that incidents of this
nature have occurred ever since I've been

called for specific actions. I am concern
about the issue but. am uncertain as to tl
course of action that should be taken, 3
therefore I could not honestly sign the pc
tion. The answer I got was that I was “i
of S‘W.” Needless to say, I wasn't sudde
ly motivated to sign their petition.
