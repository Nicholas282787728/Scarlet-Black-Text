completely subjective personal opinion and
has nothing to do with any objective
measures of campus opinion or direct ex-
perience with the procedures of the 882B, It
is interesting to note that of the student
members of the committee, the faculty
members, and the professional advisers,
none has had any direct contact with the
functionings of the 58:3 this year. Not one.

This incredible condition is highlighted in
the committee’s impression of Mandel‘s
philisophy. Some committee members ex-
press the mistaken belief that Mandel is
more “feature and entertainment oriented”
than Rawland. This is a misreading of
Mandel’s application, and never did the com-
mittee attempt to make explicit what his
true position is on the role of news for the
88:13. The committee chairwoman has
repeatedly stated that she “got the impres-
sion” that Mandel was less news-oriented It
is me responsibility of the committee to
make clear such distinctions, especially
when it is using them as reasons for selec-
tion. For the record, Mandel wants a balanc-
ed newsmagazine, and he has done much in
his position as news editor to dig up the news
in a year when news has been scanty.

 

At the very least, the

committee’s rickety reasoning
called for a review.

A review was denied.

 

Committee members who cite Rawland’s
desire for weekly staff meetings as an ele-
ment in her favor are showing in high relief

:their isolation from the process of putting out
the 5&3, Last year, when the committee ap-
proved the new format, the issue of staff
meetings was discussed specifically. At that
time, the committee at least tacitly approved
the recommendation of the newsmagazine
proposal to abandon formal staff meetings
Now committee members, the same people
who have had no direct experience with the
workings of the 5&8 this year, suddenly ap-
prove of the idea of staff meetings. In the
course of doing so they have ignored the
statements of Mandel who has had direct ex-
perience with the success of the decentraliz-
ed staff; they ignored the recommendation
of current editor Andrew Schultz, who advis-
ed that staff meetings were unnecessary;
they ignored the advice of fall semester

editor Dan Flynn the chief architect of the
April 25, 1930

newsmagazine format and staff structure,
when he told the committee members that
formal staff meetings were abolished
because they bred resentment and editorial
tyranny and had been effectively replaced by
informal staff meetings held 1n the office on
S&B nights

At the very least, this kind of rickety
reasoning calls for a review. Is this so much
to ask? Apparently. On last Monday, the
committee refused to review its decision
because it IS deathly afraid of setting a
precedent of having to review and/or reverse
its decisions.

To this we have two replies: First, if the
committee continues in the future to make
decisions as poorly reasoned as this one,
then we are afraid they will have to review '
those decisions; second, we would like to '
know why, if the committee is so concerned
about precedent, have they broken so many
precedents in this case? They have chosen .
the less qualified candidate; they have
chosen the first person in recent memory .
who has never held a staff position on the
S&B; they have disregarded the advice of '
the only people who have had direct contact
with the candidates’ journalistic abilities;
they have disregarded the advice of the only3
people who have complete knowledge of the
way the 58:3 has been operating this year.

Question: Will the committee please name
one substantive reason for the selection of ;.
Rawland over Mandel? '3

Question: Will the committee please ex-
plain why anyone should work me lower ,
levels of the S&B in preparation for a future:
editorship, when now there is no certainty
that these qualifications have any meaning?!

John Mandel put in three years of loyal :
and competent service for the S&B, He is a 3
good, solid, natural choice for the editorship
The choice of Rawland is not merely un- ’
popular, it is wrong, The committee has
made a decision on “gut feelings” rather
than on concrete criteria The precedent this:
decision gives us is that on-staff experience _
doesn’t count, loyal service doesn’t count,
superior journalistic qualifications do not
countslsn’t this incredible?

We are NOT safisfied. The committee
members have been unwilling even to
discuss the possibility of having made
mistakes. Thus, they seem to think they are ’
infallible; appeal is unthinkable. What it ,
comes down to is that the committee doesn‘t;
have the intellectual courage to re-evaluate ’;
its assumptions. '

Precedent here is an excuse for irrespon-
sibility; it is injustice cowering behind the
guise of authority.
