loggia doors will be locked at l a.m.
on weekdays and at in pm. on Frir

Cabinet

by John Wylie

Members of the SGA cabinet, in an
unprecedented move, mailed letters
to all new and returning students
outlining their disagreement with
the administration.

In a three page letter, which many
students did not receive before reel
turning to the campus because of
problems in the postal service the
cabinet outlined the four major iac-
ulty and administration actions
which sparked their desagreement:
l. The abolition oi the divisional
level student/faculty Educational

At the end of the iorthcoming 6 to
8’ week period, the security system
will be evaluated.

According to Jim Tederman dean
of student attairs, and Bob Jacobs,
assistant dean of student attairs,
both the administration and students
are responsible tor a secure cam-
pus. The admi 'stration provides
the means for security, but the ha»
sis oi security rests with students.
An effective security system de-
mands that students lock their ro-

oms, keep dormitory and toggia
doors unblocked, and co-operate
with the security patrol.

Most larceny on campus occurs
because doors are unlocked, The
break and entry theit that occured
last spring spurred the lormation of
the experimental security system.
Tederman commented that compar-
ed to other campuses, Grinnell is
lucky. Theits and attacks are tew
in number and the security system
is correspondingly minimal
