'In two important meetings this week
the new Student Council organized,
elected oiricers and began the year's
work.

The iii-st big problem the Council
has to ponder over is the matter oil
semester fee appoi ionnicnt. This was
considered at a meeting Friday after-
noon. Before the money can be allot-
ted to the various organizations, last,
year's accounts must be audited. This
was provided tor when the Council‘
voted to instruct the treasurers o[ the
Lecture Course. Recital Course, chnt.
ing Union, Athletic Board or Conti-ul,‘
and other organizations to attend the'
next morning and present their budgets '
tor the coming your as well as the‘
audited accounts of last years expend-
itui-cs. oh the basis of these budgets
the semester fee will be apportioned.

The total amount of the semester‘
fee hind thi year is larger than ever
betcrc It will come to a little over
eight thousand dollars. This 's an i _
crease or between eight and nine hun-
ircd dollars.

Three Units Instead of Two.

Contrary to the proposals made last
spring the administration decided to
construct three or these buildings in-
stead of tw It has been the plan all
along to build the units of the new
group of buildings in accordance with
the demand {or them. It is believed
that the three houses now to be con-
structed will be filled immediately and
that a request for an immediate con»
tiiiuance ot the work will result.

As can be readily seen from this
plan the progress on the Mens Quad-
rangle will be a gradual growth, just
the opposite or the plan followed in
the construction of the li‘oniens Quad-
rangle. The erection of the Men’s this
ion, or Griunell union as it may he
called, as a central building oi: the
group will occur just as soon as the
structure is needed. Additional builds
ings of the quadrangle group will be
built in accordance with the demand.
