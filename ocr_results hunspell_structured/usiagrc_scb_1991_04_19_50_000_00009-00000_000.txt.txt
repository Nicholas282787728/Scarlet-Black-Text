together collaboration of talented,

Tongues Untied shows
double burden of
racism and homophobia

By Bruce Emond

Beautifullycraltcd,sensual,and
provocative, thc ﬁlm Tongue: Un-
tied details the lives of black gay
men and the issues affecting them
in the US. The movie, shown as
part of the Gay, Lesbian, and Bi
Pride Week celebrations, depicts
the double burdens of mcism and
homophobia that black men must
confront.

Throughthelivesofseveralmen,
the film portrays the changes
brought about through the emer-
gence of the gay and lesbian libera-
tion movement, the construction of
gay enclaves in our nation’s cities,
the gay community’s traditional
oversight of the concerns of gay
people of color, and the ramiﬁca-
tions of the Age of AIDS Most
importantly, the moving poetry of
Essex Hcmphill conveys the love
and pride of the, men in the film.

Hemphill attended the screening

of the film and lectured after the
showing. Screened at several ﬁlm
festivals and widely commended,
Hemphill said Tongue; Untiedwill
roccivc national broadcasting on
public broadcasting stations this
summer. Already several PBS af-
ﬁliates have elected to not broad-
cast the movie, attesting to the
homophobia pervading society.

Exccpt for fleeting nudity and
some profanity (most or which
would be found irt any mainstream
PG rated film) one can surmise that
the fl'cll'lk depiction of homosexu-
ality was deemed too objections
nblcl Then again, these public
broadcasting stationsarc located in
the South,notnotcd loriti progres-
sivencss on issues pemining to
human rights.

Tongues Untied is a lyrical, poi-
gnant, and attocting movie which I
recommend to all, even Southam-
ors.Thls ﬁlm Willbeshowntunight
