To the Editor::

Before reading lasr week’s Smi-
zrrdrnzae/c, i knew rhar dress codes
were a serious issue among Des
Moines nighrclub goons. Now An-
gela Crowley.l<och rells me rhar we
have a seleerive dress code here as
Crinnell College. It seems rhar
Presidenr Osgood shows up ar
evenrs in jogging cogs. At ﬁrst I
rhoughr rhis was going ro he a
whimsical abour rhe
emperors new clorhes. But Yikcs noi
When I realized rhar rhc Presidenr’s
mere hinr ofckdysiasm had reduced
Ms. CrowleyeKoch ro dismay and
Karie Koesrner to anger, 1 had a
tlmeswarp, nor quire back so rhe
Inquisition, but atleast to 1947 and
rhe Church of rhe Assumprion
Grade SchoolThank God rhar Ms.
Crowley.l<oeh shared rhar rhe Presre
denr was “red in rhe face." Other
wise, I mighr havcyumpcd ro a more

moral

sinisrer conclusion—he had nor been
running ar all, bur showed up in semi»
dishabillc iusr ro aggravare folks.

You are quite righr rhar the presi»
denr represenrs rhe Collcgcr But if
Grinnell College, and above all irs
srudenr body, has a manrra (and you
can check rhis wirh Glenn teggerr),
is is rhar rhe presidens is no dilrerenr
from everyone clscithat rhe stu—
denrs, raeulry, srarf, and adminlsrrae
rion are all responsible adulrs who
equally share and represenr rhc Col-
lege Community, since a lor of us
