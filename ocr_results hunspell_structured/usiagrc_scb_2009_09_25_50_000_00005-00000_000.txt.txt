Official religion observance policy instituted

BY PETER SULLIVAN

This past Monday, the faculty approved a new religious
observance policy on Monday that officially allows students
to be excused from class to observe a religious holy day.

The new policy states that if students give notice to a
professor of class dates that conflict with
religious holy days within the first three
weeks of the semester, the professor “will
make reasonable efforts to accommodate
students." The student will then be
responsible for making up the missed
work and the professor must provide an
opportunity for the student to do so.

This policy came about after students
on the Religious Life Council, which is
comprised of members of the different
religious groups on campus, wrote a lettcr
last year to the Dean of the College, the
Executive Council and President Osgood requesting an
official policy.

The students were incited to write the letter aftei a
series of conﬂicts last fall betwccn Jewish students wishing

to observe holy days and professors who would not excuse
them. One student dropped it class because hei professor
would not allow her to miss class in cider to observe a holy

yAfter many meetings between students on the
Religious Life Council and various deans
and administrators including Prcsidciit
Osgood, Associate Dean of the College
Kathleen Skerrett helped the students
draft the new policy It was then approved
by the Executive Council and finally the
faculty last Monday.

“it's kind of surprising Grinncll didn't
have [an official policy] already," said
Rebecca Heller '11, head of the JeWish
group Chalutzim and one of the students
who worked with administrators to enact
the new policy. She acknowledged that
most professors already worked to accommodate religious
students. “It’s just for that one percent that made this girl
drop a class,” Heller said.

Previously there was no ofﬁcial policy, but the student

edi ed by Manda Morita o and De
montunoa@grinnell edu, rossdevr@gnnnell du

handbook stated that faculty “lire asked to consider student
requests for absences on these days."Evcry spring, Chaplain
Deanna Silorb would send out a calendar to the Dean of
the College containing the significant holy days for the
upcoming year so that faculty would be aware and perhaps
plan their schedules accordingly,

“Last year, when I took off for Eid,1 didn't experience
any problems, but I can understand that there were pcople
who had problems in the past and it’s really good that thc
college is addressing these concerns," said Najma osman
'12.

However, this systcm did not work perfectly. “Last year
was one of rho worst years of my time here for conﬂicts,"
Shotb said.

Shorb also stressed that the conflicts did not pertain
only to a certain religious group. She cited a professor who
had asked her to put his/her religions holy days on the
calendar she sent out because that professor had cancelled
class on those days, did not have tenure and was seeking
an extra sense of legitimacy in cancelling class. The new
policy is aimed at making these conflicts more workable,

“It puts everyone on even ground," said Shotb.

Alternative break programs surface for fall break

BYMOLLYMILLER

Typically, fall break is the time when
students have the opportunity to leave
academics behind for a week and relax,
However, every year, some will choose to
participate in one of the community service
projects known as Alternative Break.

“I’m really excited for this year," Doug
Cutchins, director of Social Commitment,
said. “VVe’re building on twenty years of
experience, and we have four great student
coordinators who are very dedicated to thc
program,"

These seniors, Justin Erickson '10, Hart
Danielle Ford ’10, Karl Ktemling ’10 and
Grace Marengo Sanchez '10, have organized

trips throughout the Midwest for the
upcoming fall break,

“I do a lot of community service, and I
wanted to pass that onto other students, and
expose them to volunteer opportunities and
get them hooked so they do it duiing the
semester," said Rebecca Heller '11.

Heller, along with her co-leader Micah
Bot-Miller '11, will be leading the trip
“Discovering Grinncll.” During this trip,
the participants will visit local schools,
nursing homes and prisons. “This trip is
special because it has a lot ofpotential to get
students to expand and grow during the year,
rather than just one week.”

“City Food, Countly Food" will be led

by Eliza Mutino '12 and Hart Danielle Ford
‘10 This trip will include expeditions to
sustainable {aims in Gtinnell and Milwaukee,
wheie the gioup will visit Growing Power, an
economically efficient farm and the Urban
Ecology center. An additional expedition
will be held, visiting farms of two students
in northeast Iowa, all the while focusing
on simple, sustainable living and ear fresh,
wholesome meals from local farmers markets.

“Our goal is to show people various food
systems so they can make well informed food
choices, and to do this through a nonrbiased
lens,"Mutino said.

Joe Hyun 1m ’10 and Kyle Blair '10 will
lead a trip to Minneapolis. The trip, entitled

“Immigrant and Refugee Volunteering in
Minneapolis,” will strive to provide deeper
insight to the lives of various immigrant
groups and refugees, as well as the issues
they face on a daily basis, The team also
hopes to work with related organizations to
help coordinate education, health and food
shelf programs as well as to interact with
immigrants and refugees.

Im, having gone on alternate break
trips twice before, is excited to lead another
excursion.

“These experiences were very mcaningful
to me,"1m said, “because 1 got to experience
the social issues around the world outside of
Griuuell."

SPARC experiences significant drop in funding

Organization reviews what student publications will continue to receive, student payrolls are evaluated

By]. FRANCIS BUsE

When the Student Publications and Radio Committee
(SPARC) prepares to work over and finalize its budget for the
fall semester of2009, it will be working with less ofsomething
it revolved aroundimoney.

SPARC VicerChair Katey Gager
'11 estimated that this year's allotted
budget will total around $80,000, a 9
percent drop from last semcster's allotted
$87,000.Thc roughly 33 decrease in the
student activity fee per student, a portion
of tuition, caused the drop, as SPARC
receives one-third of the total Student
Activity Fee.

SPARC Chair Chris Bubulia ’10,
had one word to describe the current
budget situation: “horrible.”

“Budget meetings haven’t happened, but at this point it
looks like it’s going to be tight giving publications money,"
Gager said.

With the drop in funding, Gagcr said that SPARC will

”We’re making a// the publications go
through and log lhel‘rhouri and like my
what lhose hour: went f0t,.andpcop/e
assume we want to fut (helrpuyru/l”

Likely have to turn away more potential publications petitioning
SPARC than in years past.

“Basically what we mm to do is give the returning
publications money," Gaget said, estimating that eight to 10
publications that have published in the
recent past would publish again this year.

According to SPARC Treasurer
Simon Kantet '11, the amount of requests
for money last semester was beyond the
estimated budget of SPARC. “For the last
few semesters we've had an inordinate
amount of requests and publishing costs
have gone up," Kanter said. This year will
likely be the same.

in an effort to reign in spending,
SPARC will begin looking deeper into
the way that SPARC money is used by each publication by
beginning a review of publications editor wages and hours
logged.

“We're making all the publications go through and log
their hours and like say what those hours went for...and people

Katey Gager’ii

assume we want to cut their payroll," Gager said. “We don't
want to cut their payrolls. Basically we just want to see how
much money were giving them and what they’re using that
money for because right now we have no idea where that
money’s going."

According to Bulbulia, the drop in internal funding has
led them to seek other avenues of increasing revenue, from
potentially increasing the prevalence of advertisements to
soliciting donations from alumni.

“Our board members actually suggested that we start doing
alumni subscription to student publications,"Bubulia said.“5o
basically, we could do different packages, like a news packagei
we could do the sous, the Bees, the Economistior whatever.”

While the plans have been in the workings, so far they have
not surfacedi currently, the 8&3 alone runs ads, no subscription
packages have been made and alumni donations have not yet
begun to pour in. Howcver, Bubulia remains hopeful that
external income will soon come flowing in,

“We haven’t exactly figured out all the marketing stuffbutl
should have that finished by this week,"Bubulia said.
