bring about abetterunderstanding
between thecollege and the people
of the state To this end a circu-
lar will be sent out to the various
high schools, churches. literary so-
cicties, etc., throughout the state.
The primary aim is to bring the
college before the people in the
proper light. The variety oi ma-
terial as suggested below ought
surely to ﬁnd response in many
parts oi the state. Never before
has there been such hearty co-op»
station on the part of the Faculty
of Iowa College in getting out a
similar program. The work as an-
nounced below is informal entire-
ly, though it may lead to the giv-
ing oi regular University Ex-
tension courses, ifthere should be
a Sufﬁcient demand. .

outformonth,metyesterday after-
noon and elected from the list at
candidates the iollowing men to
ﬁll the vacancies: Smiley, ﬁrst
tenor; Gannaway and Bracken,

Vacancies oi the club were dim-
ished from seven according to a
previous statement in ScARLET
AND BLACK to ﬁve.

The club much regrets the un-
expected loss oi Mr. Atkinson
from the second basses but as Mr.
Macartney now in the School of
Music has signiﬁed his willingness
to retain his membership in
the Glee Club the second bass
part will be able to sustain its
former standard The club since
the examination of applicants ior
positions has been putting in
iaithiul work at the rehearsals.
and under the direction of Mr.
Smith of the conservatory is mak
ing good strides in the way oi
progress. As the vacancies are
fewer than ordinarily a creditable

GRINNELL AND STATE COLLEGE
TODAY.

proves conclusivelythat the Ames
eleven will still be in the ring to—
day, and not even slightly dis-
ﬁgured. Our team has not gone
to Ames expecting a practice
game, but anticipating a crucial
test oi its powers, and a possible
defeati It will ﬁght hard for the
place among the teams oi the
state that victory would give us,
and if the results of our earlier
game with them count for any
thing we may be pardoned ior axe
pressing conﬁdencein our telm’s
success today, while at the same
time we understand that defeat at
the hands of the“l—Iusky Farmers"
would be no disgrace. Our men
are in such physical condition as
only Jack can develop, and our
condition has always been a large
factor in our victories, The Ames
team, too. is reported in good
shape and has been making steady
progress in the science of fonts
ball since the Marshalltown game,
We will be out weighed by a
matter of nearly twenty pounds to
the man but if this fact causes us
any misgivings we may remember
that on a dry ﬁeld quickness is as
valuable a quality as weight and
in this respect we excell our
rivals. This is an fair football
day and the advantage oi superior
weight will be at a minimum.
May the best team win and may
the best team he the one we wel-
come back to Grinnell tonight.

during the evening and insisted
on shaking hands with some oi

manifest that Miss Goldswortlly's
efforts were successful.
