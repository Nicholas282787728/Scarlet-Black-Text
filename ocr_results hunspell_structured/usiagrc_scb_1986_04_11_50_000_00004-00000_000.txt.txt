Pick up any major newspaper and you
will be sure to find an article about
Nicaragua vying for the headlines. As the
House prepares to vote this Tuesday on the
controversial contraraid package, these
articles will be widely debated by politic
eians across the country, leaving the
average American to scratch his head in
confusion,

Grinnell junior Meghan Hays tired of the
rhetoric and decided to go to Nicaragua
herseli in search of the truth. Hays spent
two months last summer in Nicaragua
working as an intern with the Nicaraguan
Institute of Social Security and Welfare
(INSSBI) in the capital city Managua.

During her internship she worked on
translating a book from Spanish into
English. but had ample opportunity to
learn about the war situation The office
where she worked dealt mainly with the
eversincreasing number of orphans
“created because OI the war" as well as
the distribution of supplies that came in
from international relief funds,

Hays also did “freelance translating"
for various groups that would come to
Nicaragua, including a man and wife team
from the northeastern US who were mak
ing a short documentary, This enabled her
to participate in an interview with a leader
of the old Liberal party of former Presr
dent Somoza

Hays arranged the internship on her own
but received a Rosenfield Grant to go
there
On why he decided to go to Nicaragua:

I was disappointed with the lack of un-
biased information available in the United
States and I felt my interest level was

my strongest conclusion is that the war is

coverage is biased:

Yes, definitely. At least the mainstream
publications that most people get their in

Student is Mexico’s Amigo

by John ilarrison

Most Americans who travel in Liatin
America are confronted by many different
things; different language. culture and
political system are just a few oi the most
apparent. Yet perhaps the lack of sanitae
tion is the most striking and painful
realization for Americans traveling in

, Latin America.

Americans rarely do anything but avoid
drinking the water to help themselves or
Latin Americans But this past summer
one American did do someuiing

For eight weeks last summer Gary
Knobloek, junior from Syracuse, New
York, worked for the organization
“Amigos de las Americas" building
latrines in a small village in southwest
Mexico. Working in the town San Martin,
which Knobloek said has one hundred and
thirty-eight houses and about one thousand
villagers, Amigos sponsored three
Americans to teach the villagers about the
importance of sanitation. Knobloek said,
”Amigos' basic philosophy is that the cy-
cle of poverty in Latin America will not be
broken until disease is eliminated.”

Knobloek said that many of the people in
his village were very poor. The main
economic activity was subsistence living
through farming corn and beans. Knobloek
explained that because of the economic
system, big families were not only come
mon, but needed so as to have people to
work the fields. Knobloek pointed out that
the infant mortality rate is astronomical.
He said that in his home. the mother had
given birth to thirteen children but only six
of them lived past the age of three.
Knoblock said “Amigos' belief is that if
disease can be reduced, so will the family
size. And when families are smaller, bets
ter economic conditions will exist for the
people More money can be spent on
education than teeding a large family.‘

Knobloek explained the main task of the

“Amigos" worker was to teach about

Unfortunately, most 0

health Knoblock said. “We tried to ex»
plain the disease cycle and how poor
sanitation leads to all types of illness."
Moreover, the Amigos worker aided the
villagers in building latrines mat would
break die “cycle of disease.” Knoblock

said, ”we wanted to instill the knowledge '

of sanitation along with building latrines
so as to make the changes last for a long
time.”

Knobloek and the other Amigos workers
also taught oral rehydration therapy in an
etlort to help the village treat the problem
of dehydration. Knobloek said that the
United Nations had sent special packets
for the purpose of oral rehydration many

years ago, yet the Mexicans had no one to .

distribute them, Thus, the Amigos workers
attempted to distribute the rehydration
packets and teach the villagers that
rehydration means are replacement of not
just water but also minerals and care
bohydrates such as potassium. sodium,
and glucose. Knobloek said that rehydrae
tion was very important to know for it only
takes ten hours to die of dehydration In
fact, dehydration is the leading cause of in
fant death.

Along with helping Mexican villagers
Knobloek said he learned a lot about Mex»
ican culture. He said “I found the
villagers not very concerned about time.
To a person in my village. “soon" could be
five minutes or five weeks," But he also
said that the sterotype of the bandito lying
in the hammock taking a siesta is false.
”The people i met worked from dawn until
dusk just to survive "

Knobloek said that people in his village
were poor by Mexican standards yet they
were not resigned to their situation. He
said, “The people were willing to work
hard to gain very little prosperity."
Knoblock stressed that the people he met
were not overcome by their poverty. He
said, “they took great pride in their family
and their community."

Knobloek did say that life in a Mexican
village was not easy. He said that every
Saturday he was awakened at dawn by the
squeals or a pig the size ot a small cow be»
ing slaughtered by men in the village. He
also said that life in a country where you
know little ol the native language can be
very lonely. He said, “there was only so
much I could talk about with the people in
the village. "

When asked it the Amigos program
made a difference. Knoblock said, “Yes
but the habits and litestyle of Mexican
culture are centuries old and will change
very slowly Amigos s hope is to change
the villages attitude on the need tor public
health and to teach the people how to ime
prove public health through sanitation "
Knobloek said the changes Amigos is striv-
ing tor are positive and work because “it
helps the culture adhere to what it con-
siders its own goal and that is keeping
children alive."
