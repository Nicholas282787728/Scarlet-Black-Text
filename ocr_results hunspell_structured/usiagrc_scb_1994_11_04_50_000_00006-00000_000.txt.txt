Carroll supporter

asks For

Stephen Sandqulst
contributing reporter

AS a Republican and a
l rinnellCollege student,l
want to say a few words
about Danny Carroll, the
Republican candidate for
State Representative in this
district. Unfortunately,
many ofus hereatGrinnell
Collcge have developed
stereotypes about the two
major political parties.
These stereotypes often
keep us from considering
thccandidates as individu-
als.

In the past. Republican
candidates have shied away
from tryingto win votcson
this campus. Danny, on
the other hand, has at-
tcmptcd to reach out to the
GrinnellCollcge voter. He
believes that the Grinnell
College voter is not neces—
sarily committed to partir
son politics but is instead
committed to the welfare
oftthrinnellcommunity.
He believes that the Grin-
nell College voter is able
to view and evaluate the
candidates not through
glasses tinted with the ugly
hueofpartisan politics,but
he/she can view the candi-
dates with equanimity bas-
ing his/her vote choice on
the issues. Danny’s com-
mitment to getting out the
vote on this campus may
not work. Someofhis sup-
porters have wondered why
heisseeminglywasting his
time and money to win col-
lege votes when his re-
sources could be better
used elsewhere. Neverther
less. Danny thinks differ-
outlyihc has faith thatwc,
as voters, are able to see
through party differences
in order to do what is right
for the community. He
believes that the Grinnell
Collcge votcr can enter this
election free from the con~
straints ofparty voting and
all of the biases it entails.

From now until Tues—
day, November 8th. you
will be inundated with in-
formation from Danny’s

Fair vote

opponent. You have air
rcady becn targeted by the
Democrats to votc blindly
partisan on election dayi
they want you to pull one
lever and gct out of the vol-
ing booth. The opposition
party has made it top prior-
ity to smear Danny’s name
by presenting half-truths
and blatantly fallacious
claims. This is sad to see
bscausc the campaign pro»
cess at this level has hith-
crto been a clean one.
Danny’s campaign. a tea
flection of the candidate
himself. will not go this
route. l-lc refuses to cam-
paign negativelyagainstthc
Democratic candidate and
compromise his own integ-
rity.

I ask that you weigh the
facts carefully. I realize
that this issue of the Scar-
let A? Black has an over
whelming amountoflitcra-
turc on the Democratic canv
didatc for State House of

Representatives. Iurgcyou .

to look pastall of the fancy
ads and catchy slogans that
the other candidate will
continue to distribute and
focus on the candidates
themselves, notjust on the
parties that they represent.
Please vote for Danny
Carroll on Tuesday, No-
vember 8th.
