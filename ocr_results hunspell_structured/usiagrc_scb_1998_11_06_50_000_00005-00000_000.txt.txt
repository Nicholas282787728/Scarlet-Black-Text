To rhe Ediror,

I was pleased ro be inrerviewed for rhe

lishcd in rhc 5ch lasr week and worn in
rhank Marr Swessinger for wriring rhc ar.
riclc, campus leaders across rhe coiinrryare
concerned abour alcohol and drugs. Grinnell
is cerrainly no ckccprion. I do want ro clarify
and expand on a few irems rhar wcrc mcn»
lioncd in rhe arriele.

We are very concerned aboiir rhc- use of
alcohol and drugs on campus. our surveys
have indicarcd rhar alcohol is rhc- rnosr
widely used drug on campus and a Slgnlﬁ»
canr number ofoursrudcnrs engage in binge
drinking. Binge drinking is defined by rhe
Harvard School ofrubiic Healrh as “ﬁve or
more drinks in a 'row one or more rimcs
during a rwo week period for men and four
or more drinks in a row for rhe same period
for women."

From our own experiences working wirh
srudenrs, we know rhar binge drinking iS a

We know from our survey research rhar
illegal drugs are used less frequenrly rhan al»
cohol. AI rhe rime ofrhe survey, marijuana
was rho second mosr widely used drug on
campus. Our pracrice over rho pasr few years
has been ro immcdiarcly involve Grinnell
Police when we see illegal drugs ﬁrxrrhand
or when we believe a snidenr is involved in
distribution.

Ir is nor uncommon for us ro receive
anonymous informarion from srudenrs, 2f»
rer rhe facr, rhar marijuana is being used in
a parricular room. In rhese insrances, we call
srudenrs inro rhe ofﬁce ro discuss rhe situar
rian Ifwe receive anorher reporr, we involve
rhe Grinnell Police wirhour warning. The
Alcohol/Drug Hearing Board adjudicate:
rhese cases as well. lr is rrue rhar rhe ciry,
sruze and federal law enforcemenr agencies
have signiﬁcanrly srepped up enforcemenr
efforrs in Cerirral Iowa (including Grinnell)
given rho recenr increases in drug use in rhis
area.

Once again, I appreciarc rhe 8&13 cov.

rived on Dr. Monrgomery's porch, we were
greeied enrhusiasrically and were given

“Humorous Candy Dclively.”

lr was rapidly approaching 7:00. “Two

“Doug Diamond, and Big Russ K.
Osgood." Unforrunarely, we hadn'r planned
a roure, and Diamond and Osgood live
many blocks away from each orher. We were

we should save rhe big guy for lasr, and

“The vigil gave me a forum here arschool
ro share wirh orher people my feelings on

Bradley inenrioned how rhe vigil was a
way ro give a sense of carharsis ro some
people. and a srepping srone for a more ac—
