As children experiencing and discover-
ing a new world. we are encouraged to en-
joy the “wonderfulness” of knowledge, to
enthusiastically and Voraciously learn as
much as possible. With the cheerful
nudges,. we expect the paths, and especials
ly the culmination, of education to be come
lorting, peacetul. and happy.

Considering this, I've often wondered
why some oi the most intelligent, iniormed
individuals I've met are cynical, ascetic,
and introspective. I know them to be ex-
ceptionally perceptive, expressive, and
capable. but they seem not to lind pleasure
so easily anymore. laughing mostly at
their own astute sarcasm. At the other ex-
treme, there are, merely pawns in a socie-
ty demanding at least a slight awareness

What is the nature of this tightrope of
knowledge we so precariously traverse? 1f
naivete and simpleness linger dangerously
on one side and a harsh reality on the
other. hoiv can we avoid lalling prey to the
boisterous winds mercilously allecting our
balance? .

Some contend that knowledge is self
defeating. that the more information we
possess. the more likely we are to be con
fused or discover disillusionment Within it.

Goodall could not have effectively com-
pleted her work if she hadn’t had some ex-

humans (and other stimulants); their

not have been an influence on her
knowledge, but her intellect and

To entertain growth, we must ex-

that "Not to go back. is somewhat to ad»
Vance. " I suspect that Wordsworth was not
afraid of his enlightenment, he was pro-
bably appreciative of the deliverance lrom
delusion. Although his poetry became less
popular. he did not regress. He gained in
knowledge, in perception; uniortunately,
disillusioned, he could not write with the
same simple understanding.

The sardonic members of our society,
seemingly despairing of their insight, are
not reacting to their knowledge per se. but
rather to the consequences oi their

Two unspoken. undeiined social

social groups in the United States: those
with a formal education. and those

those two groups: one commanded respect
of the other.

Despite the [act that I “benefited" from
those rules, and I did “come to respect."

the barrier to complete and MUTUAL
