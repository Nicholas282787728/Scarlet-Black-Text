Lisa IS' victim ot (late rape. also

that she Is not alone Dale rape,
rape between two people who knew
each other before the lnctdent. is a
growing concern on college cam-
puses, An estimalizd 47 percent of
all college women have been
ii: aulted by lirst or casual dates
or by romantic acquaintances in
lacl, 70 percent oi all sexual
assaults occur between people who
have met before

Jane is asenior whose roommate
during her sophomore year was a
victim of date rape. her former
roommate no longer attends Grir
nell. "We all lived in the same
house it happened the tirst walk
of school. when she was up in lis
room. It was difficult because I
was really good friends with him,
until I found out about it [The
situation] was really messy." said
Jane.

Often, datelrape victims find
that other people doubt their
honesty when they learn that the
victim was acquainted with the
rapist before the assault, Some
even believe that the woman
brought the rape on herself, Accorr
ding to Lisa, ”A lot of people
thought that i let it happen, that it
was my fault, People who knew
him couldn't believe he did it. I
couldn'ttell my really close friend.
I was afraid because I didn’t know
how she'd react,"

Jane said her roommate en
countered the same attitude. ”Peo-
ple didn’t believe it because they
didn't like her. She didn't get much
support on campus. Almost nobody
took her side. And it was

disgusting, the attitudes of the men
who found out what happened
They said things like, ‘That's tough
luck,‘ and. 'You brought it on
yourself ' '* ’
Them are several options for ,

nobody mole her side.

And it was disgusting,
the attitudes of men

who found out whqt
happened. They said

things like, ‘That‘s
tough luck,’ and ‘You
brought it on
yoursel .’ "

A victim‘s options include press»
ing charges formally with the
Grinnell Police and taking the inci~
dent to the President‘s Hearing
Board. The President‘s Hearing
Board is a committee of three
faculty members, chosen by the
president of the college. Each of
the people involved writes a state-
ment of what happened, has a
member of the faculty acting as an
adviser. and may call witnesses.
The president, or whoever is acting
in that capacity, makes the final
decision and has the power to
dismiss a student from the college,

Both Lisa and Jane's roommate
opted to take their cases to the
Hearing Board. Lisa explained, “I
pressed charges [to the Hearing
Board]. but not right away. i talk
ed to the chaplain and she said i

thought they were all jerks They
weren‘t at all sympathetic to the
Witnesses and the whole thing was
Completely chaotic" Jane stated
that her roommate‘s adviser was
screaming and her roommate was
eryiiig. "I think it could have been
done better.. He [the man accus
edl‘ was furious. I read his
statements and his and hers were
completely different, He complete
ly changed his story from what he
had told me before when she talk-
ed to him after the rapelt He Said
that she didn't say no "

Jane remembered that testifying
before the Board was extremely
difficult. “There was no effort to
make you comfortable and the
questions weren‘t even specific.
The three members of the exr
ecutive committee iust didn’t want
to deal with it. They wanted to get
it over with. They' didn't realize
how hard it was to testify. There
was no order to it.”

Nevermeless, Crady maintain
ed, “The college takes a very
serious stance (on rape]. it is ex-
tremely important that students
work with the system. We have
very few cases reported. Any case
that comes up, we move very
quickly."

Lisa and Jane's roommate both
talked to adult Grinnell staff about
the rape. “You can’t talk to an SA
about sbmething like that," said
Lisa. “If I hadn't already been
friends with the chaplain, 1 pro»
bahly wouldn't have talked to
anyone...“ was hard to find so-
meone that I felt that I could really
trust." Of her roommate. Jane

when I hear people say things

Lisa's advice to other students
on avoiding date rape is to be
assertive, “I'm not a forceful per-
son and sometimes you have to be.
You have to be adamant, to tell
them to stop." Crady agreed. "It is
important that students he asserr
tive in a date rape situation. if you
don't think you can trust someone,
think twice about letting him walk
you home "

Crady and Jane also stressed the
need for education about date
rape. Jane explained. “We need to
make sure that men realize that
that behavior is completely inap»
propriate, A lot of men don't even
consider it rape.” Said Crady, "I

The following statistics are from
a study funded by a grant from the

National Center for the Prevention
and Control of Rape The survey
gi-eached more than 7,000 students
at 35 schools. The findings ap-
peared in the October. 1935 issue of
Ms Magazine, The study found
that:

Fiftyrtwo percent of all the
women surveyed have experienced
some form of sexual victimization.

One in every eight women has
been the victim of a rape, accnrr
ding to the prevailing legal defini
tion of rape.

One in every 12 men admitted to
having fulfilled the prevailing
definition of rape or attempted
rape, yet virtually none of those
men identified themselves as
rapists.

0f the women who were raped,
almost three quarters did not iden-
tify their experience as rape.

Forty-seven percent of the rapes
were committcd by first or casual
dates, or by romantic acquain-
tances,

Three quarters of the women
raped were between the ages of 15
and 21; the average age at the time
