The natural reaction of a
group living in close association
is to treat harshly with any
newcomer, particularly if this
newcomer is somehow inferior
(for instance, as we see it, just
graduated from high school).
This harsh treatment is often
manifested in hazing, That few-
er necks should bc brokcn,
men’s government 7 with our
support of course 7 sees ﬁt to
regulate these activities. Unfor—
tunately. our regulatory action
has evolved into a “system of
prepping," complete with date
and attendance requirements,
and qualifying points to be
sought after. By our adherence
to such a system we are doing
our best to stifle the most vzllu-
able asset of a college commu-
nity, individual initiative.
Prepping cleverly causes the
prop with guts to compromise
because thc reward of dissent
seems very slim in comparison

fero

to the sacred hall membership
dangled before him. Let’s not
forget what that reward is
though—selirrespect. Such a pity
to offer this choice.

The great fear of the wiser
upperclassmen who espouse this
prep system is that the incom-
ing freshmen will, if not forcibly
guided, become one of thosc
lone wolves who do nothing but
study, read, and in general, fol.
low their interests in a thorough
fashion. As “lntroverty” as he
sounds, it seems to me that such
an individual has more to after
all of us than does a well
“traincd,” socially oriented right
guy (i.e., a good prep).

We must realize that any
prepping system is a method by
which we deprive ourselves of
the originality and full intel-
lectuzll contributions of freshman
classes which are coming here
with evenincreasing ability.

wELDON-EXETEK
Cont. from p. 2
most remember Exctcr.

The university has no Central
campus. The library, scicncc
laboratories, sport fields and
various lecturc buildings are
scattered throughout the town of
70,000. A scattered are 500 of
the students who live in privotc
homes which they cull their
"digs.” in some Ways 1 icit that
the physical separation of the
campus was n disadvantage. cs-
pcciclly when l was . pooled In
walk a mile between lccturc
building. in nothing ilat as there
were no time breaks between
lectures. But besides thcsc pl‘l'r
sonal trials, 1 found that there
was less sense of unity among
the students and less enthusiasm
and loyalty toward the school
than at Grinncll. 0n the other
hand there is less pressure to
contorm and less of the feeling
ot isolation from the “real'
world.

It is truc that the English
have quite different attitudes
toward various things. Take for
instance the pursuit cl knowledge.
English students don‘t seem to
realize that this is a dcspcratc
sport wnich is practiced in fron—
tic spurts mostly during the
24-hour period hcrorc exams.
They have much less of the
“busy" work of papers and
exams every lcw weeks. Ycl
somehow they manage. Without.
these threats. to do a great deal
at independent study in an an.
novinalv rela cd manner,

But thl isn't entlrelv due to
their strength or character.
Continunl exnms and papers
may keep us Americans at the
books but they also create n
tremendous amount or busv
work. By the whalish tutorial
system. in which each student
meets with his tutor and per.
hoos one nr two other students
IlDr at least an hour 1 week.
the tutor is able to fiml out
exactly how mltrh and what

sort of work the student is
doing and what he is capable
of doing, Thus there is not the
need ror so many checks on
the student in the form of
exams, The student has more
time to explore any field in
his subject which interests
him particularly, he has time
to keep abreast with current
chairs, and he has time simply
to think.

Another diitcrencc was the al—
titude between students and fac-
ulty. Very few or them have
the {ri ndly, informal relation-
ship w'mch our dillrients and fac-
lty for thr- most part do have.

"Raf: Week"

Probably the biggest cycnt
during the school year is the
wcek in spring cnllcd Rag Week
Every university ha: n ling
Week during which all the
dents use thc cust- of r ng
honey for ho t- m mdm‘ to

such as klrlnappmt! the mayor,
lccnking irtl) inils. and putting
hairs on top of cathedrals. The
town folk pay for this entertain-
mcnt bv contributinc to the se-
lcctcd charity.

The last day ol Rag chk is
like Spring Day and Homecom-
ing combined, A parade oi
llonts, mock bcnt races, hall-
stagedJlalf—real street lights
with rival schools, auctions 01
girls rm- thc privilege ortaking
them out to ten, and soccer
games are only a part of the
day. The iinal event is a mas-
quernde ball at which a good
fourth of the Exetcr students
were dressed ns American
cowboys, “Qumm, eh, what?"

i wish i could say that i
helped to “foster intcmationnl
friendliness and understanding,"
But, you know. that's a pretty
hie iob. So. while I'm not sure
how much i “did my bit." and i
can say that it was a wonder.
inl and fascinating year for me
and an experience that i wish
more of us could have,
