Looking at new hotlsing options available next year

Gender-neutral housing

Following the footsteps of Harvard
University Grinnell has adopted a new
housing option available starring in the
fall of 2010. In an act that emphasizes
just how few limits we really have, the
housing department- has taker legs to
acknowledge the various preferences of
students with gsnderareuiral housing,

introducing gender-neutral houSs
ing as a possible living arrangement for
current and future Grinnellians means
that in dcsignarcd dornts throughout
campus idonts can opt out of iden-
tifyin / i s either male or female when
iilling out their housing terms. The
implications afthis action are that any
strident who w as can choose how to
live without hi mg ll‘lc gender binary
forced upon them.

There's no reason the College
shouldn't mcct student demand and
go gender-neutral—a large amount of
ﬂoors already have ﬂoor-elected gen-
der-neutral bathrooms, and students
could still have complete freedom to
choose their roommates.

If the program thrives, which wt:
hope it will, we would love to see the
housing option placed in the term sent
to incoming ﬁrst-ycar students. With
the formation of viable gender-neutral
housing options that Cncoumgc gender
neutrality, Strident lfihirs, SGA and
thc Collcgc have acknowledged rhnt
Grinnell is n safe place for gender neu-
trality.

Sub-free South campus
The recent addition of James hall

to subrfree housing. beginning in the
2009-2010 academic year, ensures that
there is one dorm with substnncc'rfree
housing on each residential campus

While the administration and the
Residence Life Committee asserts that
rlris is a good idea, many students have
voiced concern and displeasure.

The reasons given to students for
the inclusion of James in substance
tree housing included clam from an
informal p-wcb poll-«data which WilS
later ignored-sand a sudden pressing
need for what the administration has
termed “purity" on campus.

While we retognne that increas-
ing demand for sub: housing
calls for increased uvdilal ' of that
housing option, the administration’s
blatant disregard for strident opinion is
troubling.

In an interview with the SEBDean
of Students Travis Greene citcd that
this decision was made partially based
off of an informal Pioneer VVeh poll,
conducted last semester. The results of
this poll favored Norris residence hall
to be clmugctl to substance free over the
alrernative option, Cleveland/Main.

According to Greene, even after
this poll, students currently residing in
Nun is werc upset about changing Nol-
ris into substance-fret: housing. Greene
also and that South Campus students
were Similarly unrvclcoming. However,
in stating this Grecnc roups snidenrs
into two sep rate on Norris or
South Campus. Norri rs one dorm of
students on North Campus, with 102
students, whereas South Campus is a
collection of siv dorms, housing 406

students.

Not only is making rhcsc two group-
ings arbitrary, but if the administration
seuks to make a decision based off of
empirical data, in numbers alone rhe
amount of students unwilling to set a
change to substancesfree in their CUn‘r
rnunity is greater on South Campus,

More imr
pnrranr than
this is the fact
that the ild‘
ministration
used an infer»
mal Pioneer
Web poll in
malts: an
pot‘tant dcc on. It’ the rdm istrarion
wanted ra base their decision simply-
off of a poll, [hcl'll should have been a
greater effort made to effectively gather
empirical data, or- data that was more
accurately representative of the wants
of students. .

Additior lly, the informal Pionccr
\Veb poll didn’t even offer James resi-
dcncc hall as an option. Basically, the
Pioneer Web poll didn't prove that
there wits a demand for suhvfr‘ee dorms
on south campus. Regardless, the ad-
ministration placed it there rind made
no effort to gauge student response.

Thi. rant tor sulr-r‘rce housing on
South Campus stems from the admin»
ismriorr’s desire for “purity" on campus,
which Greene mentioned in an all-
campus e—muil.

Obviously there is a demand tor
more sirbsranccri’rec housing as indi-
cated by overﬂow and resulting creation
of informal substance ﬂee clusters on

‘ ioffo'EdiiriLa'l' '

different ﬂoors around campus. If stu-
dents want to live in a substance-free
environment, thcy should he allowed
that opportunity

However, by offering parity as the
main reason for this decision, the ad-
ministration fnils to recognize that
parity inherently does not and cannot
exist on this cam-
pns. For example,
if the administra—
tion was actually
concerned about
parity on rill parts
of campus, every
dorm would he air
conditioned, lot
jusr East Campus and Norrib.Thi
ridiculous suggestion: and so rs the
gestion that parity exists.

Even beyond those concerns, we
also wonder whether current subrfree
students will draw into Limes. If few
students do, this will result in a dorm

Dogs, Bones and Berries: everyone is a winner

1 have rcccndy begun to undersrand two serious and
conﬂicring facts about my life.

1. I an. very compccirivc. 2. 1 am not very good or
games. in her, I’m so bad ar such a variety otgamts drar
it might be considered a skill m and otrtsclr.

I play beer pong like an overly enthusiastic T-Rex,
I never throw anything
exccpr scissors in Rock
Paper scissors, and tire
hit myself in the head
with a Frisbee—more ,,
than once and, possibly, 1
more than twice. The ‘
only mine 1 cver really '
feel good about is Children's Edition Jeopardy, because
if I can ignore the fact that my opponents are ten, I feel
great about myself. What color is a giraffe? Bani. Yellow
and brown. sorry, Tyler horn Possum crcclt, Tenn, I
just won my elementary school ten new computers.

Once, in high school, I was playing Bogglc widr my
best friend,who had never played Bogglc before. “Aha,”
I thought slyly to myself “1 will cnish her but be mag-

C‘ s

amorous; me p, L

nanimous in Victory and all will love me." After the time
was up, we compared words and I had about three more
than she did.

it wasn't as good as 1 expected, but 1 was still pret‘
ry happy until she said, “wait, what about these?"
and armed over her paper to reveal about 40 MORE

When I began to suspect my dcrrcrr early in liic,l
started making up my own games instead. some were
well-formed and had rulcs. Others were called Dogs,
Bones and Berries and involved pretending to bc dogs
and collccring food for the “dog toast," Everyone wins,
unless you count the loss of time and dignity.

Every Christmas, my family uied to steer me away

from DEE (us all the game's avid followers called it) by
playing compcritivc games. This would have probably
improved my skills, except that my dad's idea ota Ta—
boo clue is saying, Arizona" and than scaring ar me
heady-eyed until the time runs out. (The ails\vcr:Tomb»
stonci Arc you aonrally kidding me?). Couple this with
his rcndcncy to make up scrabble words and rhcn hide
the dictionary so no one can contest them, and you’ll
understand whyl never got better.

I wish [was better at games. I can count the ones I’m
decent at on one hand: Eananagmms, Clue, The Most
Dangerous Game and How 1 Me! Your Moi/Mr O‘uote
Recitation.

I'd love to play any and all games wirh you. Just un-
derstand let I might end up shouting, “I will set you
on ﬁre! I will set you. ON. FIRE.” it’s nothing personal,
just a habit that comes from long nights of staring into
my dad's eyes, wonderingjust how genetic his particular
brand of madness is. And if that doesn’t work, we can
always play Dogs, Bones and Berries.

I hear there's a dog feast coming up, and lmy, are we
shorr on supplies.
