made three diiierent appearances. The
ﬁrst introduced him to his arrdience as
the president-elect, making one at his
numerous speeches on route to his
inauguration at Washington.

in the second appearance Lincoln
was represented to us in the light oi
his home lite, his personal charactcr,
and those ianrous eccentricities oi nae
turc and physique that so color the
lite oi that great statesman. What a
patience with his little son Tad, what
a depth oi pathos underlay his levity
as he read the newspaper rciticlsms oi
himseli; what a genial, homely philos-
eplly he squandered on his wiliul boy;
and above all that strain oi love ior his
icllowrncn that so-predominated his
lit Truly, wearing that traditional
gray shawl, ungraciously sprawling in
his chair, and speaking with deep.
merged tones, hlr. Chapin gives us a
very realistic impression oi Lincoln
the commonplace and Lincoln the
great.

impressrvcl. portrayed Lincoln's en-
during optrnrisnr through the great
war, lie gave his commands and ads
vice to the magma ~ stage loll: with
a dir .t and simple steinuess that needs
ed no supplementary imagination.

in his last appcarance he most ci-
icciivcly represented the atrial serious-
ness and unmitigated strain the long
campaign had lain on the President.
But through it all there came those
rough bits oi wit that tinged the whole
interpretation with good humor. Here
