Best Movies of2004

Prim: Million DoI/rir- Baby was thought-provoking,
even for a nonsboxing ran. Hopeful in a grim sort or
way. I thought Hillary swank did a wonderful job.
And Morgan Freeman is the kind of wise old friend
we all wish we had.

Greg: 1 agree, swnnk was spunky, The characters
were likable characters struggling wrth important is
suesThere were many intriguing and tun lines. I es-
pecially liked the dialogue between Clint Eastwood
and the priest.

B: Rachel and I
haven’t seen Briiy yet,
but both of us loved

R: When I learned
that they were making
a sequel to Brﬂne Smi-
rim, 1 was angry. That
movie is on my short list
of favoritcs~1 feared ir would be ruined by a sequel.
but Eeﬁm' Snorer is, like The Empire Strikes Bret, one
of those few sequels that rs better than the original.
our heroes are older, presumably wiser and world-
weatyAmuch more engaging than they were nine
years ago.

The dialogue is amazing and painful at tunes,
yet their verbosity can‘t save them. As much as they
discuss big issues rheveommunicate more with each
other through gestures and sidelong Ulunces The
characters oilesse and Celine and the5 relationship
between them seems real in ways that most movie
romances aren’t.

Law was in every third movie that came out this year,
but he was never amazing. People do think he's sexy,
though.
Also: mom and dad, you both really liked Fill/ling
Newt/luld. One question: why>
B: Yeah why? This was Johnny Depp’s bad year.
P: It was a gentle movie, Don't think or it as a
blockbuster that it was hyped up to be,I liked the plus

relationship that led to growth for both It was nice
as a story.

Worst Movies of2004

P: Probably all of us who saw it are in “great
mentiW/mf (/1: [If/cop] D47 W: Kna'zu? All this movie
taught me was that I sure don’t know much about

physics and New
Age thinking and
how they might ﬁt
together. Seeing it in
the theater in Port—
land, Orc., whole
part orrr was mined
was about the only
good thing about
watching it.

G: This movie
was a bunch of
loosely connected
malarkey t’iom new
age mystical rhinks
ing. 1 think they
grossly distorted the
underlying physics.
i slept through parts
or the movie because i went with a group orrriends
and one of the friends thought is was a great movie,
so there was no graceful escapel

R: I have two nominations: the aforementioned
won; the [glory] and I {Hear 1) Hurrah-er, Apparently,
I don’t like movies that tackle existential questions.

house for 4 months this spring. bumping far superior

Illustrative of the new age ideas: a character as-
scrts that water responds to emotionsi it’ you tape
the word love on the side ofa glass of water, the was
ter molecules in that glass form pretty designs. Since
our bodies are 80% water, we need to be careful about
what sort of emotions we have, because our bodies
will react to them.

Hrrrlrrirer was a more mainstream peddling or
such tripe. It did contain a few enjoyable acting per—
tormonces. one major final strike against it: it had
the least sexy sex scene that 1 saw on film this year,
Dunking one's partner’s race in a muddy puddle and
rubbing dirt up and down her legs is not so hot in
my book.

13: Uh. Rachel, you might not like my review (on
page 7), Continuing my girlish romances theme, the
movie that evoked the most hatred in me was Clam:
That film just hated love and the other side-benefits
of having Sex with someone, None or the charac-
ters were inrrrguing, and it trampled maliciously on
themes that C/mringﬂmy covered so artfully.
