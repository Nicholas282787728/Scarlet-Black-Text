Speaker Tells 'Men. That Religion
Must Not Perish From the
Grinnell Campus.

"Sumeune asked me recently wheth-
or there is an atheistic club on the
campus," Dr. Steiner [old lbeY. M, C.
A. Thursday evening at the opening
meeting in the "Y" building. “I told
the inqllil‘er that there is not. enungh
religion on the cillnlills to arouse all
athelsﬁc Club. Atheism is always a
reaction against some strongly reliET
10115 group." 7

“I am not afraid of unhelief," Dr.
Steiner went on, "i! there is acﬁvu
thought on religious subjects goinn
on." It is the function of the ‘1. M.
c. d, to give the impetus to that kind
of thought, he explained. There are
men on the campus with strong bod-
ies find alert minds whom the “Y"
ought to stimulate in thought and lend
toward a religious awakening.

“I am not interested in the Y. M.
C. A. as such." Dr. Steiner continued.
“If. is immaterial whether or not thc
organization itseli parishes. But re-
ligious thought must not perish. If
it may be stimulated by an open for-
um, or even by a silent meeting. we
may omit hymn singing and devotion-
a1 exercises: but the purpose at the Y.
M. C, A. must be fulﬁlled somehow.

ltcricws “1'” History

“We have a great religious inher—
itance at Grinnell." Dr, Steiner told
his audience. "The or used to have
fl much lnl'ger attendance," he stated.
“It was it uuwerlul influence about
the campus. Some of this yet remains.
Grinnell without the v. M. C. A. or its
counterpart would no longer be the
Grinnell we know. But we are in
danger of losing Lllls inheritance if
the ”Y" continues to weaken.

"‘thi. does this all mean? I dodu‘t
know, but i do know that Jesus can
multiply the power of character a
thousand times. No man should'leavc
Grinnell who hasn't met the challenge
of Christianity. ,

"On this cnmpus the ”Y" is the on—
ly organization with a Christian pur-
nose. All others have failed to meet
the religious challenge. If you men
lnll us,” Dr. Steiner concluded, "our
failure will be complete."

November Tanager to

The Novcmber Tanager, Grinnell
literary magazine, will appear some~
time today, according to Wayne
Gard. The number will have a politi-
