A FEW CHURCH.

Great thinker-sot today are convinced that the
church as it has existed through the ages will collapse.
very likely during the lite of the next generation, but
that a new and better church will emerge. This
church which is to collapse is the church based on the
old traditions.

For a number of yenrs a grave questlon has been
puzzling some of the minds of the older, the presenl
generation. They wonder why it is that college young

However, the next generation is not content to bring‘

an old. burned—out religion into a new and advancing
civilization. it does not wish to entirely discard the re-
ligion as it tum come down through the ages. It wants
to apply the fundamental truths that lie at the hearl
of 1.th religion 00 meet the needs of life in the twentieth
centllr But the older generation rules the church at
today, uud scowls on any change suggested by the next
generation. Consequently that gencruticn is patiently
waiting for the present generation either to move on, or
to cutch the vision or the need a! advancement and w-
oporatc with it in making the church meet modern neces-
sities. The old church as it has come down through the
:lges has run its course, and in its day has served society
well, it must now become fertilized with the germ at
new lite, and give birth to an otispring that has embody
led within it both the ahsolute essential truths that the
old religion contained. and the spirit of progress that
exlst! in the modern world.
