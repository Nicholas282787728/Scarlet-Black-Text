Socialism Has

“A socialist is one who desires that
land, mines. and other natural re-
sources and the principal agencies of
production 'and distribution be pub-
licly owned, and democratically man-
aged for public profit rather than
private ., declared Norman Thomas
in his lecture given Thursday even-
ing in Herrick chapel on “What is
Socialism."

Mr. Thomas, socialist candidate for
president' of the United states in the
last general election, spent the en-
tire day in Crinncll as the guest of
the Y.M.C.A. and the YWCA,

“This is a world which has under-
gone an amazing transformation. it
is a world where proverty need no
longer exist, with the application
of machinery .to every process of hu-
man life." he continued, "and where
machinery can abolish poverty it is
a disgrace to have poverty. A price
of our relative interdependence upon
nations is an increase of areas of in—
terdependence upon one another.

"Access to land is as easy as ac-
cess to air. We get possession by
title. When we have such a condi-
tion existing as the Astor family of
New York. we will not get rid .of
poverty. Tenants on farms and
slums will not disappear. 1 have
challenged people everywhere to tell
me how to get rid of the slums. But
as long as people hang onto their
land in the cities. we can do nothing,

Socialism Hos Philosophy

"This is the type of world where
machinery holds us in bonds that we
cannot break. We cannot afford the
luxuries of a class of owners; it is
not just. it is wasteful,” he declared.

Socialism, according to Norman
Thomas, has two major divisions. it
has a philosophy—the philosophy of
cooperation. It has also a program
of peaceful reorganization. The
program covers the acquisition of na-
tural monopolies and resources for
the society. it covers unemployment
and accident insurance.asteady pro-
gress toward the ﬁve day week, to
spread around the beneﬁts of pro—
sperity, and lessen technological un-
employment, it betters internation-
21L relations through discontinuing
the collection of private debts by
public armed forces.

‘Hoover in Blunderland’

"If we got disarmament it would
be Alice in wonderland and Hoover
in blunderiand. 1f the nations have
agreed not to ﬁght again, why not
disarm entirely? Then if they do
start again, let them start all over
with new armament.

Pioneers Fail to Overcome
Early Lead Obtained
by Drake.

Following in the footsteps of their
varsity examples, the freshman cag-
ers of Crlnnell staged a great rally
in the closing minutes of their game
with the Drake frosh here last night.
but fell short of victory, losing by a
count of 15 to 14.

Ullrlch started the scoring of the
game with a field goal but Winters
matched it and Drake pulled to a
5 to 2 lead. The irrepressible Pio-
neer cager dribbled his way to a pair
of field goals before half time. how—
ever. and at the end of the first per-
iod Crinnell led. a to 5.

Pioneers Rally

Early in the second half the Bull—
pups opened with a new offensivev
centering about Winters. and ran up
a 15 to 7 lead. The Grinnellians
were undaunted, however, and with
two minutes to go were erailing 15
to 10. A long Shot by Ullrich hit
the hoop and a sensational one-hand
affair by James brought the count
to 15 to 14 with a minute to go. The
Drake cohorts were able to hold this
slim lead until the final whistle.

llllrich was easily the outstanding
man on the fear with his long shots.

He scored nine points to lead the

Return Drake Victor.

While Coach Truesdale and his
basketmen are in Oklahoma today
preparing to close the cage season
tonight with Tulsa university, Coach
Duke and his Pioneer track squad are
defending the Missouri Valley indoor
track championship at the Drake
ﬁeldnouse in Des Moines tonight.

Although coach Duke is slightly
pessimistic of Grinnell's capturing
ﬁrst honors, Crinnell has entered a
ﬁne squad of distance men in the
long runs. Captain Mark, Pelletier.
Murphy. H. Edwards, Carley, Secor
and Pye all are capable of burning up
the track and are likely to win points.

While Duke hopes that Washington
and Creighton will lessen Drake's
points in the sprints and hurdles, 0k—
lahoma is taking the joy out of life
by boasting strong men in the dis-
tances. Unless one team has an out-
standing set of runners. it seems likely
that Crinneii and the Aggies will con—
cel each other's points and Drake may
take away the gonfaion of victory.

Aggies Have Adair.

The Aggies' team, made up of
Burch. Stockton. Calhoun, Collins and
Jenkins, are among the best in the

Forensic Holds
Formal Meeting
Last Wednesday

Men’s Forensic held its third for—
mal meeting of the year in Music hall
Wednesday evening. Thfee speakers
talked on the program. They were:
whose speeches precipitated heated
discussion which nearly everyone
John Perry, who talked on “Required
Courses of a Col‘ege Education;” Don
Brodine, who spoke on “The Organ-
ization of School Activities" and Ed»
ward Brownbridge, whose subject
was “Personnel Work in Manufactur-
ing Centers." Francis Hawk, vice-
president, presided at the meeting.

Perry's theme was opposition to
the many required courses necessary
for graduation at present; he urged
concentration on two or three sub-
jects rather than acquaintance with
a wide range of subjects, Brodine
made out a strong case against in-
cluding more than two or three ac-
tivities in 011’s college life, arguing
that to do so precludes the possibility
of getting much out of the actual
studies pursued, and gives a person
the feeling of utter disorganization
in his work. Brownbridge outlined
ways and means being used at pre-
sent by manufacturers to improve
the welfare of their workers.

 

‘What About His Terpsichorean Ability?’

“Can he dance? How about per»
sonalityi Good-looking?"

No, not Ziegﬁe‘ld inquiring about a
now mole lead in some Broadway
production, just the series of ques—
tions which are running rampant at
the quad. Dates for the varsity
dance March 8 will come from the
across the tracks, and for a change
the “ﬁnal word” will come from the
dorms.

Shall I ask Tom, or Dick or Harry
40h, gee. I'm just dying to ask my
S. P. (secret passion), but I’m so
afraid he'll turn me down!" .

Heads are put together to com~
pare notes and glean advice. “Who'll
I ask? Say, has so-and-so got a
date? ’Spose he’d accept if I asked
him? What shall I say?” Such
questions are endlessly plied needless
friends, who are in a similar uproar.
while delicious uncertainty runs
endlessly. No candidate for presi-

dency could be more discussed than
the unsuspecting males upon which
these fair birds are about to prey—
and who meanwhile are praying for
the ladies‘ aid in the way of helpful
suggestions.

It's a novel idea. Why not give
the girls abreak, since there are
more of the fair than the otherwise
sex in these portals? 0n the sur-
face this would seem to be legitimate
reason for the affair, but realizing as
we do the extent of women’s emanci—
pation, why not give them freedom
to choose their men openly?

'ext Saturday the League hoard,
ths wicidcr of punishments and
privations. plays its benevolent role
of staging this girle varsity. It will
be the men who will be carried off
captives to the dance, singing some-
thing like this:

“Merrily rm brought alongm

Because she picked on me!"

Dibble Beats Four

in Inter-Dorm Polo

After taking a trimming at the
hands of the Smith hall aggregation
last week, the Dibble hall water polo
team downed Building Four Friday
afternoon to score a 23 to 6 victory.
Both teams played a better game in
the first half, which saw Dibble pile
up a 27 to 5 lead with Rinefort and
DeWindt doing most of the scoring.
Miller, Soesbe. Ewald, Tatotn and
Heldridge also saw some real action.
Lamberton was the outstanding der
fensive man for Four while Brad-
ford, Wiley and Brodine carried on
the offense.

The Clark hall outfit, also victims
of Smith earlier in the season. dump-
ed the Langan first place hopes
overboard rather unceremoniously
with a 14 to 1 victory. Gabeline
and Roth led the scoring for the vic—

tors with Stevenson, Bures, Holmes '

and Walker holding the Building
Two aggregation at bay. Pojman
was the strongest man on the Lan-
gan outfit.

poned until next week.

Teget Announces
New Changes in
Quad Regulations

Several changes in quadrangle
rulings which go into effect immedi-
ately have been explained to the cot-
tages during the past week by
Fern Tegot, president of the league
board. These have to do mostly with
callers at the cottages.

When the cottage parlors are
open, couples or callers must come
into the parlor and not wait in the
halls or on the steps.

No couples will be allowed in the
corridors, on the steps, or in the
parlors of the cottages during quiet
hours. Quiet hours are in effect
from 3 until 12 a. m., from 1:30 until
4:30 and from 7:30 until . 0 p. m.
such day of the week except on Fri-
day aftemoons and Saturdays.

Penalties of the above will consist
of the violator being sent to study
hall for the following night. During
quiet hours all noise must cease.
Noise consists of the disturbance of
others, and the complaint of the
house chairman or any girl will re-
sult in the violators receiving a
minor. Three minors make a major.

Upon the receipt of a major the
offender will be sent to the study
hall for the following two nights,

Any girl failing to sign in or out-
of-town cards Shall also receive a
minor.

The action on the matter has been
thought necessary because of the
abuse which certain priviledges have
received. It is not so much a change
as it is a reaffirming of old regular
tions.

Thomas Club Has
Namesake As Guest

The Norman Thomas club enter-
tained Mr. Thomas at a luncheon"at
the faculty club at 12:30. Members
of the Social Science club also at.

Thomas as candidate for the presi~
dency.

The Fellowship of Reconciliations
sponsored a tea in Mr. Thomas’ hon-
or at the Associations building at
4 o'clock, Mrs. Steiner served as
hostess. A number of faculty mem—
bers and students attended.

nell went into a tie with Drake for
third place in the final Valley stand-
ings by defeating the faltering Okla-
homa Aggies here tonight by a score
of 36<25. Creighton and Washington
finished the season tied for first
place. For the Aggies, it was the
close of another disastrous season on
the hard-maple court; they failed to
win a single conference game, and
their only win of the season came,
against Oklahoma university early
in the Season. -

The Aggies opened with a Whirl-
wind attack that netted a lead of 15
to 7 at the end of the first half, Dur-
ing this period, they displayed a
smooth, fast-breaking offense which
Crinneli was unable to cope with. an
offense that the Aggies have seldom
been able to show this season, but
one which nearly defeated Washing-
ton university here iast night. when
the Valley champs won by a 23-25
score. Leading the Oldaboma attack
were Joe Ley and Captain Fleming.
whose accurate passing and shooting
largely accounted for the Aggies‘
lead in the ﬁrst half.

Strong in Second Half

Coming back strong in the second
period, the scarlet and black aggre-
gation showed the results of the her
tween—halves confidential chat with
Coach Truesdale, for they shot from
all angles of the floor and passed
with deadly accuracy to score savan-
teen points in the first six minutes
of play, putting them in the lead,
23—21, a lead which was never head<
ed during the remainder of the
game.

While the second half, on the one
hand. was marked by the cool precis-
ion with which the Pioneers worked
the ball in under the basket, using
again and again the delayed attack
for which they have become famous
this year, it was also marked by the
usual “blow-up" on the part of the
Aggies. DeLong led the Grinneli of-
fense, counting eight field goals and
two free tosses for a total of eight~
een points. Douglas and McCreary
played their usual outstanding game
at the guard positions.

Closes Unusual Season

The game last night brought to a
close a most peculiar Valley basket-
ball season, one in which each team
had its decided ups and downs to
score sensational victories, or lose
by amazingly large scores, or to
drop games by one or two—point mar—
gins in overtime periods. On its
foreign trips to Washington and
Creighton, the Pioneers lost to both
teams by overwhelming scores, only
to come within an ace of beating both
teams on the Grinnell floor and
hence of capturing the valley title.

Drake, whom Crinnell defeated
twice, was able to unexpectedly de«
feat both Washington and Creighton
once apiece, and hence put these two
teams in a tie for fii‘st place in the
conference, as they defeated each
other once apiece. The Oklahoma
Aggies. of course, were the weak
link in the loop this year. winning
not even one conference game, The
