sNew NUMbER iN TOWN

by S helly Bla it

On April 29th something new
came to Grinnell. It is a full-
ﬂedged bar With bands, a foosball
table, and drinks priced within the
student's budget. After being
closed for a year and a half, The
Number, at 807 Commercial. is
open again under new
managementithis time without
gcrgo—dancers.

The new ownerrmanager is 22-
year-old Brian Mullan, called
“Goose” by his friends. After
spending two years in the army,

bar with a wide variety oiliquor, so
the alcohol part. at least, of The
Number should be completed sunn.

The Number has been most
successful on the night when bands
play. There is a one—dollar cover
charge on these nights, unless one
can't find any room downstairs.

Mullan hopes to expand the
downstairs and to fix the electrical
wiring so that bands can be heard
upstairs. In addition to the one

Mullan entered the University of .

lowa, then dropped out before
completing a year to enter the bar
business. He reasoned that the
signiﬁcance of a college degree
was low, especially since he saw
many college graduates who
couldn’t find jobs.

Mullan also noted the need {or
something like The Number in
Grinnell. The new bar, open daily
from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m., is unique
because it features live music,
together with an almostcomplete
bar, serving beer, wine, and mixed
drinks. In addition, The Number
offers an alternative to Grinnell's
lowkey night life as “a place to
go”.

The first thing I noticed on going
to The Number was that it is not
your average small-town bar.
There is an upstairs and a down-
stairs room. each with its own bar.
The downstairs room is long and
narrow. with tables along the wall
leading to the space at the end of
the room reserved fDri bands. This
area is partly enclosed by Indian
‘ prints when not in use. Across from
the row of tables is a sunken bar
and a small space for dancing.

The most striking aspect of the
upstairs room are the large red
roses on the wallpaper, reminding
one more of someone’s house than
a drinking establishment. During
the week, Mullan keeps this room
closed, and moves the foosball
table downstairs on to the unused
dance floor. Also, during the week
and when bands aren't playing,
music comes from a cassette
tapedeck with several speakers in
both rooms. Instead of repetitive,
top-forty, one speaker, quarters
eating jukebox music, this is free,
with more variety.

The first time I ordered a drink
at The Number, I was in for a
surprise. I wasn’t used to 70 cent
mixed drinks and 75 cent tequila
sunrises. The Numbers liquor
assortment is limited though, so
don’t plan on going to the bar and
ordering a Brandy Alexander or
kahlua and Cream. Mullan is
concentrating now on fixing up his

days and characterized the bar as
“wild." He said most ol the people
who went there were “hardcore”
and that sometimes it was so
crowded that people were standing
on the tables and hanging onto me
ceiling. The bar was not as tidy as
it is now,Weiskopi said, and the
number of college students who
went to the bar was relatively
small.

foosball table he has now,he plans
on adding a pool table and a few
pinball machines. Mullan also
hopes to expand the live music on
the weekends to include folk
musicians during the week.

Mullan concedes that general
response during the week has not
been as good as he expected. He
has a plan for attracting college
students. It would involve issuing
special cards to students in dif-
ferent dorms, and naming certain
days when students from a par»
,licular dorm could get cheaper
prices than the rest of the
customers.

In trying to attract more
customers, one of Mullan’s
main problems has been lighting
the old Number‘s reputation. The
old Number closed after run»ins
with the police over the admittance
of minors and selling liquor after
hours.

Number several times inthe old

aspect of the old Number was its
professional “go-go dancers" or
strippers. They would reportedly
put their song on the jukebox, and
then go into their strip routine on a
small platiorm, all within legal
bound, of course.

Although the two bars have the
same name. the old and the new
Number are fundamentally dif-
ferent. The group the bar en-
tertains now seems to be younger
over-all, and, if you’ll excuse the
word, the permissiveness of the old
Number is not present in the new
bar. One important difference
working to the advantage of the
new bar is the basic trust and
support that The Number now has
from town authorities.

Mullan has avoided extensive
advertising because he feels that it
is unnecessary to the success of
The Number. l-le views his bar as a
place where people can go to have
a good time and not have to worry
about being hassled.

Pot Law revision

An attempt to amend the
marijuana section of the lowa
criminal code was recently made
in the State Senate. SF. 85, the
comprehensive proposed revision.
is currently before the House
Judiciary Committee after passing
in the Iowa Senate.

SF. 85‘ leaves the marijuana
penalties as they are under current
law—up to six months in jail ior
possession of small quantities.

NORMAL (National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws), however, is
working to amend the marijuana
section of the code. The approach
they are taking is a modified term
of decriminalization; minor
marijuana offenses should be
treated with a citation, similar to a
traffic ticket. Based on the suc»
cessful Oregon law, which took
effect in October, 1973, the
decriminalization amendments
were defeated in favor of ﬁle
stricter ones which were recently
passed.

skyrocketing use of marijuana is
the principal fear expressed by
opponents of marijuana
decriminalization. Without the
threat of criminal penalties, they
fear use of marijuana would in
crease enormously.

Surveys taken in Oregon,
however. demonstrate this is not
the case. One year alter the
removal of criminal penalties for
marijuana possession. the in-
dependent Washington, D.c. based
Drug Abuse Council found that

there has been no increase in
marijuana smoking in Oregon
despite decriminalization.

Those who don’t smoke
marijuana do not base their non-
use on the supposed deterrent
effect of the law. Rather, they cite
simple lack of interest and fear of
adverse health consequences as
the major reasons for not smoking.
Fear of the law and lack of
availability ranked low in their
explanations for not smoking.
Thus, increase in marijuana usage
need not neccessarily follow from a
change to decriminalization.

In addition, it was found that
when given the Choice, the public
strongly supports the civilrfine
system.

The amendments NORMAL is
suggesting would retain strong
criminal sanctions against all
commercial sellers, but would
simply treat the possession and
not-forrprofit transler of
marijuana for personal use as a
iinable-only offense. Thus, the
state would maintain an official
discouragement policy against
marijuana use, but would stop the
tragic waste oi lives, careers, and
police resources that results from
the current criminal prohibition.
NORMAL urges citizens to write
letters to members of the House
Judiciary Committee urging
amendments to SF. 85 which
would treat minor marijuana
violations as nonrcriminal of-

lenses.
