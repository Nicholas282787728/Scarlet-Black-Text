NINE NEW STAFF MEMBERS
ARE CHOSEN AT MEETING
YESTERDAY.

‘STAFF IS LARGER THAN EVER

Aotinn Comes as Result of Policy
to Make Board of Editor:
More Representative
and Efficient.

Nine new start members were clect~
ed to the SCARLET AND BLACK alter
a carciul consideration or the tall try»
triit material at a meeting or the Board
or Editors yesterday arternoon.

Edmund riadlev, '16, Russell George,

'17, Agnes Carlson, ‘17, Bernice Brads
ley, ’17, and dim Plait. ’17, were those
chosen train the o ginal twenty-tour
who entered the tr out at the begin-
ning ot the school year.

With these addi oils to the start
there are ﬁ\e more members doing no
live work on the paper than has ever
been the case heiore. This action was
taken. ho“ eve in an attempt Io make
the SCARLET AND BLACK start more
representative and etiicient.

During the past'montlr the report
ing editors have been overloaded with

l Ct|“5L oi’ the. iki'v :‘ttzﬂ meln’
bers. but with’the new arrangement
it is hoped that the material will re-
ceive more attention with less ‘time
spent.

Three of the present stair will also
be occupied with the Annual Board
work during the year, and the added
toi-ee will permit “off-days" tor these
individuals when necessary.

The material submitted in the (We
triit preceding the election was oi
unusually high order especially among
the women. There were less men err-
tered in the tryout than women, but
their eorrtrihiiticns were or such a high
character that the members should
prove a decided addition to the Board.

nine worrieu became eligible tor
election during the try-out. and a
decision was reached only alter long
consideration. Any one at the candi-
dates would lrave heeu a valuable rep»
resentative, and the mater l or some
ot the zispirzinis‘will he held over until
