“WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE
THINKING.

The following articles have been
handed us by two members of the
school who are interested in theScariet
&Bl:lcll. The editorial columns of
the S. & B. are always open to stud-
ent opinions. it you haveanycour
iuunicatlbns or suggestions to make
on the course of events in our college
life write them up and hand to the
editor.

Iowa College may well be proud or
its beautiiul campus, or its splendid
trees and shrubbery. its well kept
lawns and the air of neathess and
thrift which is so generally apparent
Certainly n0 college in the state can
boast a more beautiful campus, for
its size, than can Iowa College

Yet there is still room for improve
ment. The ground near the heating
plant has been looking very untidy
and ill-cared for of late. It seems to
have been converted into a sort of
dumping ground for old boxes and
boards, for the dead branches trimr
mad from trees, and for the general
rubbish from the college buildings.

The stranger approaching irom the
west or south-west receives a most
unfavorable ﬁrst impression of the
campus, and people who Judge the
college iron the passing glimpse they
get as they pass through on the Iowa
Central road, certainly cannot judge
it fairly. Students who see the place
daily become in a way. accustomed to
its appearance, yet some or the joy of
the morning is taken away by this
ﬁrst glimpse or their day’s work,

Naturally this bib of space around
the heating plant cannot be kept. al-
ways in an absolutely trim condition,
but it seems to us that it might. with
aliltle ell'nrt, be very materially im-
proved in appearance. our campus
is far too bosutiiul to be disﬁgured
ereu [or so small aspace.

During last winter there was organ»
lzed illGrinnell, Lawn and college, a
booster movement which has certain-
ly not been without its results. but it

that just now the time is ripe, in fact
that the need is pressing forasorne~
what similar movement, but this time
agenoral boosting movement and a
general waking upon the partor the
student body.

There is no denying that things
about Iowa College have been in a
lethargic state this {all and this con-
dition has been conﬁned to no one
line of activity in particular but has

been felt on every hand, It is notice-

SCARLET AND BLACK

able in the societies whom it must be
admitted, the interest of former
years is not being equaled, It is felt
in the religious work where lack or
support renders anything’approuch-
lng average work impossible. Class
meetings are poorly attended and
neither the Band or Mandolin clubs
have boon rig-organized, all of which
things illustrate the deplorable apathy
and lack of interest which has been
felt even in the class room The only
possibl'e exceptions to the proceeding
statement seems to he the Athletic
interests and the Glee Club and even
these are not without their ”linock»
ers.”

But even Worse, there seems to be
no logical reason Why things should
buso. Vile have the largest attend-
ance in the history of the school, we
have ideal conditions [or the success
of student activities, and We have
people at the head of the various in-
terests wllo were, last year, the most
active people in school. Then wily
we say this apathetic spirit, this
“don’t care Keeling?" Although we,
by no means, consider that we alone
have noticed this condition, WE be-
lieve that the student body, 2L9 a
whole, only need have their attention
Called to the feeling and they will re
spond us they have in the past. Let
that. purpose, then, iustiiy this article.

Let us Wake up and “boost” for the
things that make up our coilego life.
Let us put aside, for the moment,
any possible personal prejudice and
work tor the good of the old solrco
and make Grinnell more beloved than
ever. If youliappen to be a society
man work ior your society; if an
Mrhlete, [or athletics: if a musician,
ior your club; itaY. M. c. A. man,
for your association; if interested in
the publications, for your paper and
if you are not interested in any of
these things boost you that interest
which is nearest to you and thereby
boost the college as a whole. Old or
new, man or woman, let's all put our
shoulders to the Wheel.

The Scarlet and Black has made its
share of adverse criticisms in the
past and may in the distant future
but for the present, if we are to have
the active, enterprising college which
We have prided ourselves on in the
past we must have an awakening, a

boosting movement. and the Scarlet
and Black is anxious to head lust such
a movement.

Everyone is urged to sign up im-
mediately for tickets for the recital

Grinnell is cerLainly to no congratw
lated upon the new and unique
improvement that R. R. Rust is in
stalling in his'store this week. He is
having put in an uprtohate fountain
and expects to serve hot drinks,
irappes, lunches, sliorbeis. ice cre‘oru
sodasand many other dainty dishes.
This will bean innovation for Grin-
uell and will ﬁll a long felt need.
