LETTERS

+T0 the editor

Dear Scarlet & Black,

Since you made such plaintive

appeal for letters to the editor, I
couldn’t resist sharing my opinion
about the Lizz Westman’s article
listing all the things that suck about
her life. I’d just like to remind her
ofa couple ofthings that are a little
more important than the inferior
“Friends" premiere or her greasy
hair:
It's beautiful here in the fall..The
sky is blue and the leaves are turn-
ing colors and there's always a
breeze. You’re attending one ofthe
best schools in the entire country
No one can make you take a class
you don’t want to take. You can go
to three different movies every
week for free.You can go to parties
every week for free. Your email tier
count and Internet access are free.
You can get medicine from the
health center for free. People in the
dining hall can pack a lunch for you
just how you want it.. You can eat
Cocoa Puffs for dinner and no one
will care. if you go to Cowles.
Sheila will say hi to you every
morning. People here do crazy,
funny, entertaining things every day.
You get to decorate your room in
whatever way you want. There are
kitchens to cook in if you want to
make cookies or macaroni and
cheese.You can walk around at
night without worrying about get
ting shot. You can start virtually any
club you want. There are exhibits
on the lower level of Burling Li-
brary. There is a fall break. (And a
Thanksgiving and winter and
Spring one too.) There is a spiffy
new science building.

I could go on, but I have a feeling
you only have so much space to
print these things If Lizz needs
more proof, let me know and I'll
send you some more.

Quiet doesn‘t mean Complacent

I am writing in response to the edir
torial printed in the 9/23/97 edition
of the 5&3 regarding the lack‘ of
student voice and concern on camr
pus. Though I agree that the cam~
pus culture and modes of expres
sion certainly changes each year, I
think the editorial did 2i severe in~
justice to the hundreds of students
who are constantly raising their
vmces and expressing their concern.
That students are seldom writing to
the campus newspaper during the
first month of school says little
about the overall activism on camr
pus this year.

An excellent example of the very
loud voices of students on campus
is the issue of multi-cultural space.
Last May, hundreds of students
demonstrated in support of multi~
cultural space, and the Trustees of
feted their first ofﬁcial support in
retum. Last weekend, as a direct
result of continual student proracr
tivism, the Trustees decided to bring
an architectural consultant to catn-
pus soon to begin the process which
could produce a blueprint and an
eventual groundbreaking.

Whether through the space issue.
community service, or political and
social activism, Grinnell students do
not suffer from a lack of voice. The
larger problem on campus right
now, however, is the idea that an
issue isn’t important to students
unless they are loudly complaining
in the middle of central campus, as
well as in campus publications.
Since arriving back on campus, stur
dents and administrators alike have
been clamoring for a hot issue,
something about which everyone
can get angry and frustrated. In our
constant search for loud contro-
versy, the activities of many proac—
tive and passionate students are be-
ing unfortunately forgotten.

Undoubtedly, campus publications
are and should be an excellent fo-
rum for students to mice their opin-
ions. But to be honest, the majority
of those letters are written as a nega

tive response to something a person
has read, not as a positive statement
about a particular form of student ac-
tivism. Instead of focusing on the
negatives, what we really need to do
as a campus is applaud and support
those positives consistently being cre-
ated by hundreds of students. At
Grinnell, the appearance of quietness
should not be mistaken for complar
cency and inactivity among the slur
dent body.

Sincerely,
Erin E. Childress. ‘98

An open Letter to the Campus Comr
munity:

1040-97 is notjust a normal day for
the campus community this year. It
is a day for relaxation from a long
week’s work, a time for hanging out
with friends, a time for the Student to
express him or herself, and above all
it is a time for campus unity. The
north campus/south campus di-
chotomy makes our campus and our
lives more limited than they need to
be. It is our hope that this campus—
wide, studentedcsigned and created
event will provide a chance for the
campus community to embrace a
common spirit. This spirit is simply
to have a good time. Hopefully, this
spirit will encourage people, north/
south, hippie/jock etc. to mingle and
perhaps make new friends ;).

More than just providing the whole
campus a catalyst for unity, 10—10-97
will give every student a forum to
express his or her views, complaints,
or political messages. An Open Mic
is planned for Main Loggia. Students
can use this opportunity to talk about
something that has been bothering
them, sing a song. play banjo and have
people to listen. Amonument is also
in the works. This stmcture, a five
foot tall pyramid made out of wood,
will be another outlet of expression
for the campus. Markers and Pens
will be in the area for everybody to
write or draw whatever they want on
the monument: poems, pictures, po-
litical manifestos. The result will be,
in effect, a piece of art designed by
the Grinnell College community.

Activitic's are planned to begin in
early afternoon on south campus and
early evening on north. A variety of
activities are available throughout the
night. Communal activities are
planned to punctuate a uniﬁed cam-
pus spirit. Therc will be DJ’S and
Bands and Large sound systems at
each location. Grinnellians are urged
to not necessarily stay on their side of
campus but to venture to parts ofcam-
pus unfamiliar to them and to be
warmly accepted.

Thanks,
10-10~97 committee

To the campus community:
Last weekend Grinnell celebrated the
dedication of the Noyce Science
Center. The new facility is a dra»
matic improvement over that which
it replaced, and the building was
clearly designed to create an atmo-
sphere conducive to doing science,
and doing it well. However, we,
members of Grinnell Women in Sci»
ence (GWIS), believe that there are
still substantial barriers for Grinnell
to overcome in the struggle to pro
Vide a good science education to a_ll
students. Speciﬁcally, women and
minorities in the sciences at Grinnell
often face an atmosphere that is any
thing but conducive to learning. We
call for action towards creating a
more positive environment at
Grinnell for under-represented
groups in the natural sciences. To
illustrate the need for action, we pro
vide some illuminating statistics
about existing inequities in the scir
enccs at Grinnell:

3 out of 16 declared physics majors
are women: 0 are racial minori-
lies.

3 out of 19 declared computer sci-
ence majors are women.

In the fall semester of 1995, there
were 7 women and 7 men in the
class of 1998 who planned on
declaring a physics major. Cur-
rently, there are 2 women and 7
men.

Don’t Ask Me,

BY LIZZ WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

Apparently there are those who be
lieve that I am too cynical, that I do
not see the bright side of campus life
at this here Grinnell College. Well,
I ask them, what else am I supposed
to write about as the campus cynic?
You see, I get paid to be the campus
cynic. IfI wasn’t cynical and chose
to see the brighter side of things.
people would get nervous because
the brighter side of things is not all
that funny, noris itmy style. Do you
think people would read the Onion,
watch The Simpsons, The Daily
Show, Daria, and read Life In Hell if
it wasn’t a cutting and cynical out»
look on our miserable little lives?
(Not that I feel I am as clever as Matt
Groenig, Lizz Winstead Dr Greg
Kinnear, mind you.) Do you really
think that bands like the Smiths and
the Cure would still have the same
die hard fans if they sounded like
Hanson or Hootie and the BIowﬁsh‘I
If my name was Lizz Westrnan, Little
Miss Happy Sunshine I really doubt
people would want to read this very
much. I know I wouldn’t. Hell, I
doubt I’d have that many friends.
Well, maybeI would but I bet the real
me wouldn’t like them very much. I
agree last week's column was the
weakest of the four. However, I
thought people who enjoy my out~
look might want to see its origins.
It's one thing to have a good day and
it‘s quite another to delude yourself
with thoughts that this world is just
fine. If youthink everything is just
great nothing will ever improve.

Now, I really don’t mean to rain on
Ms. Perky's parade, but it has got to
happen sometime. You see, I, too,
was once a happy little ﬁrst year that
was so glad to be away from
Brookﬁeld, WI that I also sounded
like an admissions brochure. How»
ever, after two long years at this
school, the admissions ofﬁce is afraid

I’m Just A Girl ’ Tales From A

ofthose like me. I'm very glad that
people are happy here. I’m happy
too, its just that I take those cloud-
less, fall days with a couple allergy
pills, a box of Kleenex, and nasal
spray. Oh yeah, and even still a girl
had to get away from me at the li-
brary because I was sneezing so
much.

Now, please don't assume mail was
all over everything at this school
when I ﬁrst got here just because I
said I loved stuff. Let‘s just say I
really liked that whole self-gover-
nance thing. The ﬁrst time I went to
a Harris party I thought to myself,
“Please dear Lord do NOT let this
be how I spend my weekends in col-
lege. Ihated teen dance clubs in high
school and I really don't think
Milwaukee’s Best is going to change
my mind. Hell, I'd rather be sober
and checking my email than here."
Fortunately, I haven’t had [0 go back
to those things much again. Oh yeah,
and every semester I‘ve been on the
meal plan here I’ve lost about twenty
pounds from where I should be. My
ﬁrst year it was actually much worse.
However, my problems with the
malnutrition the dining hall provides
really could ﬁll up an entire issue of
the 5&8... Oh, and supplementing
my diet with unnutritious food as
suggested is almost as bad as the
greasy food Quad serves anyway. I
fought very hard to get off of board
last year and my dinner in the dining
hall this week reminded me in three
terrible hours of serious physical pain
why I fought so damn hard. Just a
note: I ate cereal every day for an
entire year. It’s a common practice
here and it's also a very bad thing to
do to your body.

Now I'm sorry to whoever has these
complaints about my writing if I‘ve
personally offended you ’because,
well, I've been trying as hard as [can
to be as cordial as possible. Remem-
ber, I have spent many months at this
college up all night writing papers.
dealing with the soap opera, failing
to live up to my expectations, etc. It
happens to most people. trust me.
Nevertheless, Ifeel that I really need
to point out a fundamental flaw in
your argument. Nothing at this
school is free. You'll learn this as
you rack up college loans. Please
keep in mind that most everyone at
this school develops a love/hate re-
lationship with Grinnell. As campus
cynic, I try to make light of the hate
side.

 

There are no female faculty members
in either physics or computer
science; there is only one female
faculty member currently teach-
ing in the math department.

Less than 5% of the science faculty
are racial minorities.

We applaud the positive efforts be»
ing put forth by the New Science
Project to encourage women and
minorities in science at Grinnell.
However, the New Science Project
reaches a limited number of Grinnell
students for a limited amount of time.
If Grinnell College wishes to in-
crease the number of women and
minority students in the sciences it
is essential to increase the scope of
such efforts. We suggest the imple—
mentation of a forum in which stu-
dent concerns regarding the environ-
ment for women and minority sci-
entists can be voiced. Furthermore.
we believe that Grinnell should take
proactive measures in hiring more
women and minority faculty. Finally?
we would like to see greater faculty
and administrative support of groups
such as GWIS.

ters of gender and racial inequity in

OPINION

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Colurnist

Mary cleans toilets in the dorms. It
is not a pleasant thing. She cleans
the carpets in thehall and lounge, she
takes out the trash, she scrubs the
sinks and makes them shine, and she
does it willingly. It's herjob, she ap-
plied, she accepted, she does it well,
Generally, she was grateful for the
work, generally. it wasn’t had work
at all. Generally, she goes about
ﬂashing a kind smile and bubbling
with kind words for the students she
sees, but the toilets, they make her
grumpy, they make her mad. It is
the toilets she hates. When she
comes home at the end of the day she
is thinking of them when she answers
‘good or bad‘ to her husband’s in-
quiry. On agood day she needs only
to ﬂush through the cleanser and give
a gentle scrubbing with the brush, but
on a bad day it is like she herself has
been flushed.

To arrive on a Monday after a re-
laxed weekend of barbecues, beer

and kindness with her husband and .

friends, to ﬁnd a pool of water on
the ﬂoor when she enters the bath
room. To know where it came from,
to know that the toilet has been
clogged, probably since Friday night,
to know that she Will have to face
such a rancid thing. And on her way
in to the dorm, climbing the stairs to
the third ﬂoor, her floor, passing
three separate students, none saying
hi, just walking by on the narrow
staircase as if she were not there.
And when she opens the bathroom
door and sees the puddle she won-
ders if maybe it wasn‘t one of those
kids that just passed her who caused
this mess. As she delicately steps
through the puddle, not knowing
what the water holds, not wanting it
on her uniform, not wanting it to

nother World

somehow splatter up under her uni»
form and onto her leg, she curses si-
lently to herself. Silently, ‘cuzifthe
students hear her, ifshe raises a fuss,
they might call her a bitch. She’d
heard so many awful things, from
students thinking themselves alone
and the tales passed round in the
lounge; so many stories from so
many other women who had worked
at this so much longer. And between
the curses she mutters “I‘ve got to
do this" ‘cuz it is a well paying job,
and with beneﬁts too, so difﬁcult to
walk away from. But as she steps
closer she can smell what awaits her
in the stall. She gags and turns away.
Then, knowing that it must get done
and that she is the one to do it. she
pushes the stall open and sees what
has been left her.

The toilet is full to the top. There
is a mass of toilet paper jammed in
it, she immediately recognizes it as
the cause of the blockage. Above and
around and swirled about with the
paper are chunks of shit, soggy and
water soaked from the many hours
of floating. There is, ofcourse, urine
as well, and though she doesn‘t rer
ally take the time to examine she
suspects vomit to be the ﬁnal ingre»
dienl in the mess. Again she turns
her head, disgusted. Her eyes fall
on the toilet paper roll, pulled out to
an excessive length and soaked
through, peed on. She leaves the stall
and hall and rests, her back bent
against the wall. There are no stu-
dents around, bnt she can hear the
heavy bass thumping through their
rooms. She starts to cry.

To arrive on a Monday and be
greeted with that. To know that
whatever is there is her responsibil»
ity. To know that the students on the
floor have waited for her to clean up
this mess, using other bathrooms in
the meantime, complaining to each
other of the inconvenience. To know
that these students were headed to
such different destinies. 'To know
that the students responsible most
likely didn’t feel responsible and
would in no way be held responsible.
To know all this and have to go on.
She continues to cry as the bass
thumps on, and kids voices leaking
out through closed doors, “Is she ever
gonna cleanthat goddamn-bathe
room?" ’
