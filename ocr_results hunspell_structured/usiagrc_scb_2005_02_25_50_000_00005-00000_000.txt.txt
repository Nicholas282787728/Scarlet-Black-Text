AND THE

WI

As the Academy Awards approach,
one of our movie reviewers predicts

who will win and why

Bv BRADLEY IVERSON-LONG AND FAMiLv

Bradley: Hooray, the Oscars are Sunday! Oscar season
is great because people stop talking about silly things like
war and politics and instead focus on why Martin Scorsese
doesn’t have a little gold statue rind which A-List celebrity
looks the most like a prostitute. To maximize the fun quo-
tient and minimize my effort exerted, I've invited my family
to join me in predicting who will win what. So, back by my
demand are Greg, Pam, and Rachel. Ifonly we all had super-
powers and stuff.

Pam: lfwe did,I might look more like Kate Winslet. At
least {oi the costumed Oscar party we are attending Sunday.
I expect there will be lots ofboxers, but I can’t be that Obvr
ouS.Maybe the big orange hoodie I’m trying to and will help
me prrll it off.

The movie is kind of poetic and sappy. I think Oscar voters

Campus bands

BY BRADLEY IVERSON-LONG

Be in Gardner Lounge tomorrow night at 9 for the only
concert all semester with a title that warrants an FCC vio~
lation: the Frecsound Fucking Awesome Campus Bands
Show.

Tomorrow night’s concert will feature at least 6
campus bands, ranging from the Industrial Theme
Parks electrorock to the epileptic noise of WWII
DJ gonzo, aka Adam Culver 05 will Di between
sets and after the show is over.

“I plan to make them dance lrke drrrnk people at
a wedding," said Culver

David Clark '05, a member of WWII, thinks
Grinnellinns should check out l‘l’lC Fi'eesound show
“because you just might hear or see something that
will rinse the poison from your system—tor some
time, at least, however brief."

One problem facing campus bands this year has
been the lack ofpiactice space. In past years, bands
often practiced in IVIIis'ik I-laus, which currently
does not exist.

Recently, however, Frccsound converted Nora
iis Pit Lounge into a practice space. According to
Brendan Baker ‘06, the room is frequently booked
to capacity during its operating hours, which are 12
p.m:8 p.m. MondayrSaturday,

“The practice space in Norris is working out great." said
John Chavez ’05, one ofthe concert’s organizers.

“The only problem right now is noise for the residents
of Norris, which totally sucks, cause no one there asked to
live above a practice space,” said Chavez.

Best Supporting Actress
Nominees: Cate Blanchett (T175 dwintar), Laura Linney
(Kinny), Virginia Madsen (Sidewayr), Sophie Okonedo (Ha—
te! Rwanda), Natalie Portman (Cluster)
B: Cate Blanchett’s take on Katherine Hepburn was just
amazing.Then again,Natal.ie Portman is young and hot.
Who will win: Cate Blanchett

Best Director ,

Nominees: Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby), Taylor
I—Iackford (Ray), Mike Leigh (Vern Dmllt), Alexander Payne
(Sidewayl),Mattin Scorsese (Theda/int”)

P: I haven't seen Tbs Aviator, but of the rest, Eastwood's
movie was the best, even though the bad guys (and girls) were
all so bad. But I loved the religious discussions in it. It’d be
nice ifMikc Leigh would be recognized as the great director
he is, butI don’t think it could happen with this movie.

8: Agreed. Still, Eastwood has already won a direct-
ing Oscar (for Uaﬁigim), and Scorsese hasn't. I think the
Academy will continue to play nice, and hand out Oscars like
party favorsmeverybody gets one.

Who will win: Martin Scorsese

Best Picture
Nominees: T/Je Ari/inter, Finding Newer/mix], Mil/rm Dal/m
Bray, Ray, Sidewayl

R: I only saw one ofrhese movies, Finding Newer/end, and
it didn't even make my top ten. Are Oscar voters on drugs?
Restore my faith in your sobriety, Academy members, Pick
anything but Finding Neon/mud.

P. I would question Ray being one of the top ﬁve, too.
Give Jamie FOXX his statue, but to me this was a bad nominal»
tion And as I said before, I liked Mil/fol: Dull/Ir Baby a lot.
So that’s my vote.

B: And, again, you're right mom. You're so smart and
pretry and wonderful. Thanks again for the whole “college
tuition" thing

I think the Director/Picture Oscars will be split, since
Baéoivood' s Mystic River got ignored last year. And this way,
each movie will have Oscar Winner" slathered on its DVD
case

Who will win: Mil/inn Dal/in Baby

to perform in Gardner Lounge

“For a while we were one of the only bands that could
practice regularly because we use a tiny drum machine rnr
stc1d of 1 massive drum kit," said Joe Gcni of Industrial
Theme Park.

“But now that space is open and from all I hear cams
pus bands are back with a bloody vengeance.
Which is why people should go to the show,”
Geni said.

“A lot ofbands haven't been able to perform
for a while, so it should be some hot stuff."

While most of the sets will be relatively
short, the concert is crucial in getting campus
barrels back in the swing ofthings.

“Most ofthc bands are still in the early

stages of writing songs and developing
thcir respective rcpcr-toires,"13akcr said.

“However the primary go ot the show
are to or hance Frccsound‘s campus presence,
rc»encrgizc the scene and encourage other
students to start hands of their own,” he said.

Baker also said that the show will be a
good chance for students to start think-mg
about contiibuting to the annual Frcesound
CD, issued 1t the end ot the school vear.

Frcesound recently received funding from
SGA to brry a gait and bass for the practice
room as well as srrpplics to maintain thc current equip-
ment. The practice room is now fully outifrted with all the
basic equipment needed to play in a band.

Students can sign up to use the practice room on the
calendar posted outside of the room.
