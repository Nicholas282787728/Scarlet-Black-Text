CENTRAL AUDITING NECESSARY

Do C lnllt‘ll college organizations l\(‘(‘(l .1 CC“-
tral Auditing , 'lClil? The question is dollntnlllc.
but; the gene nl irclld of campus r-mllllluut scouts to
favor the establishment of some such audit. EN v
business housc depends upon accurate ﬂf’t‘OlllllS and
there is no logical i‘coson why Grillllcll organiza-
tions should not 017Ci'ﬂli‘ iii the slime fashion.

The audit would not SCI'YO in any wily in up-
provc or disapprove expenditures. lull wriuld

simply soi'l'c as an aid to keep hooks llzlhlllccd and d

to give new ofﬁcers on ~exact accounting of the
standing of the books at the time they take their
posts. It would beneﬁt the treasurers and business
managers ill rclicvillv from them any stigma of:
dishouc y or graft which Dame Rumor is zipt to
foster as long a. the books are not checked by SCHK‘
disinterested par It would benefit lliCi‘Clir’llliS ill
their credit systems'for they would be able to
follow the ﬁnancial standings of organizations and.
our-c, they were ill the “vet,” could refuse llit‘lil
credit. This DIOYC would lie all adequate chm-k mi
expenditures without any ‘r’lPDl‘Ol‘ﬂls or disapprou
nls. '

Collcgc ofﬁcials would be aided by such an
audit since they uould not he called upon after
three or four years to lliztkc good some nrgalli ’ll'lO“
bill. when the ofﬁcers i‘usponsihle for the ill(‘lli ing
of the hill had left; college. Members of orgmiivu-
lions would beneﬁt from knowing exactly how
their group stood ﬁnd how much they might logicr
ally be spotted to take care of ill the way of
ﬁnances. No campus organization willfully exceeds
its income nor does it wilfully lcm'e debts for
members of the following year to pay.

”The business man is gone, and res

Purely biological reasons are the

Army a Mystery

In telling of the development of
agriculture. he recounted the begin-
ning of collective farming two years
ago. when the peasants rebelled
against it and killed their stock
rather than submit.

in answering questions asked by
members of the audience Mr. Hindus
brought out the points that: there is
a very small communistie movement
in Asia; the soviet government is at

for the proletarian and the college
graduate; the Russian army is a
