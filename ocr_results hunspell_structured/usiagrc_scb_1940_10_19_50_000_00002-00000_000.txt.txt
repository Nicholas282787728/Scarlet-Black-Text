0 A Word on the Conference

A rounded editorial policy should include
editorials both of praise and of criticism.
Occasionally an opportunity, sucll as the
International Relations Conference, arises to
include both iii one editorial.

Grinnell college has been recognized
throughout the Middle West as a center
of liberal and progressive thought and ac-
tion. One of the institutions bearing out
this statement is the annual fall Interna-
tional Relations conference sponsored by
the International Relations club. Each year
a well-rounded program, adapted to the cur
rent international situation, is offered to
students of high schools and colleges in the
middle west. Inspiration, information and
interpretation of international affairs are
presented by outstanding lecturers who
give freely of their time and energy to
those in attendance.

However, the great majority of our own
Grinnell college students are blinded by
their proximity to the conference and so
engrossed in their own personal concerns
that they ignore the opportunity completes
1y. They fail to see any connection between
the conference and their own futures. Re—
gardless of the excellence of the speakers
this chronic indifference on the part of the
student body has always reduced the great
potentialities of the meetings and put a
damper on the whole occasion

What must visiting delegates from other
colleges think of us? How long shall we
let this apathetic attitude prevail?

In condensed form, the purpose of this
conference is: to help us understand the
forces at work in the world today which

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

will inevitably shape our lives There is
still time to hear the concluding address by
Dr. Clyde Eagleton: ”The Changed Char-
acter of Modern War” at 7:15 p. m. tonight.

. A “Student Leader” Scrlbbles
Grinnell College
Gi-innell, Iowa
Oct. 19, 1940
Dear Ma:

You know, I‘m not so sure that this idea
of being on the Student Council is all that
it’s cracked up to be. At first, it seemed
like a pretty good deal, being called a “big
man on the campus” and all. But that’s
all there is to itijust being called that.
(And I’m not so sure that the fellows mean
it even when they do call me that, either.)

After all the time I've spent in council
meetings and everything,
done much except suggest that everybody
else put on a carnival. ‘

But what's worse than that, the council
is talking about the so»called “Brooklyn
Conference” again this year. And you re
member what I told you about that, after
I came home from the thing last year. I
still can’t see why they bother to stick a
bunch of us off in some hick town just so
some people can feel their ego has been
flattered. We never accomplish anything.
Take last year, for instance. We wouldn’t
have had anything even to talk about if it
hadn’t been that some of the Ilouestudent
leaders made a noble effort to bring order
out of the chaos of ollr constitution. Alid
of course, to save our face, we had to up
pose that during most of the conference, so
no results came of that until long afters
wards when a few interested people, 1 'nor—
ing all the bickering of the greater “lights”
of the campus, wrote a new constitution alid
presented it to the faculty and student
body,

Of course, we had lengthy discussions last
year about some craclopot “leader’s” pro-
posal to turn the barn behind the White
House into a restaurant. Yes, we really
talked loud and long about such an idiotic
idea.

But that‘s just about the total of the
accomplishments of last year’s ”Brooklyn
Conference.” Alld even these “results"
were nullified by the utter disorganization
of the meetings. In fact, there was one
delegate who had sense enough to clear ollt
on the first day, it was so bad. ,

Now they are talking about doing the
same thing again this year. Why I don’t
know. Unless it’s just because some people
feel they can't be real “student leaders“ uni
til they go to a’ “Brooklyn Conference.”
Personally, I’d rather stay home and do
math.

Why can’t campus big»shots satisfy their
craving for fame in some more constructive
manner?

Your loving son,
Willie.

‘Latin America Wants
Cooperation’———Mrs. Platt

By Russell Cain.

"Latin American countries are
as anxious to cooperate with the
United States today as we are to
have that cooperation," was the
keynote of an address delivered by
Mrs Robt. Flatt, president of the
Pan-American council, Chicago.

m. yesterday.

citing the fact that the culture
and. advancement of the southern
countries is about like that of the
United States in 1900.

Concerning subversive acti—
vities, Mrs. Flatt said, “There are
propaganda organizations (unc-
tlonliig in the southern countries
just as in our own United states,
but America. need never fear Nazi
penetration through the Latin
American countries, If we co»
operate with them now."

In conclusion she said that it is
up to the Americans to cultivate
the Latin American good will be
cause they need each other.

English Trusted Hitler

In the third address of the cons

university, Des Moines, stated,
“England is fighting with her back
to the wall because Chamberlsin
and his government couldn't quite

Whether or not the British can
take the terrific pounding which
they are how undergoing, no one
knows, Miss Jones claimed. The
morale or the people is strong, but
the end is expected hourly by the
western world.

As to the loyalty of the empire,
the speaker felt that as far as the
Dominion: were concerned Britain
had nothing to fear. Ireland,
India and 'small West Indies
islands, however, were points of
trouble.

"The England of today has as
assets is high morale, an inflexi-
ble front, common to lords and
laborers and a heritage of military
glory,” she said.

Eaglelon Disturbed
By American Thought

By Florence Bennett.

"The thing that disturbs me
most about American thinking is
the supposition that if we sit
back and do nothing, we’ll get
into no trouble," stated Clyde
Esglston. professor of mteihm
tioiml law at New York univer-

According to Mr. Eaglelon, the
danger of direct invasion need
not be feared because it will not
be necessary. If Germany and
Japan can conquer Britain, they'll
have the United States in an ace
iiomic. viss. The United States
will then be unable to compete in
a world organized on a totalitar-
Ian basis unless it is organized in
a like manner.

As a solution, Mr. Eagleton
could only state that democracy
must be kept free, and that reor-
ganizotion war the social revolu»
tion would require infinite tact
and understanding,
