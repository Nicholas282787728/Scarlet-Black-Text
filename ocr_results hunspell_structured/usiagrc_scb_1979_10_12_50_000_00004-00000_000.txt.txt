& CSL

Curbing campus vandalism was the
item of concern at last Monday's
meeting of the Committee on Student
Life (CSL). Various methods of fining
were discussed, but there was no clear
concensus as to which method would
be best, so a deCIsion was put off until
otter break.

The meeting started with a discus-
sion oi a committee draft proposal
concerning fining procedures for van-
dalism on campus. The proposal
details how fining of members of the
campus community will be handled in
cases where a person is identified as
responsible for damage to common
areas and in cases where no one is
identified.

While no olie had problems with the
former section, the latter was cause
for considerable debate. The draft pro-
poses that if no one is identified, the
dorm in which the damage takes place
would be fined for repairs, It also re
quires Joint Board to set up a $700
fund to cover fines for halls when hall
funds are depleted; appeal procedures
[or fines are also spelled out.

,’;The mo iund is set up to deter vane
dalism: 3100 out 01 it is to be set aside
in a sort-oi prize fund. The dorm
which on May 1 has the least amount
at fines to date would receive the
money for hall social events.

Several non~eommitiee members
present at the meeting questioned the
effectiveness of this method. They
pointed out that the iining procedure
would ’not serve as a deterrent,
be ddse. in cases where the vandal is
not" identified, the hall or SGA would
be iorced to pick up the tab for the
damage.

One student suggested the commit-
tee look into a system whereby in such

cases all members oi the dorm would
be assessed or iined for the damage to
the common area. She contended that
such a system would encourage
witnesses to the act to report the ole
fender. Vice provost Ken Browning,
who chaired the meeting in Dean oi
Student Affairs Jim Tederman's
absence, said he was not sure or the
legality oi such a plan, but that it
would be checked out.

Another student questioned the er-
fcctiveness oi such a plan, saying that
it treats everyone on campus as
children, and potentially punishes in~
nocent people who have no relation to
the crime Most oi the others at the

debates fining policy

meeting, however, did not agree with
this analysis,

The discussion continued with
several arguments being restated. (the
criticism was that none or the plans
really attacked the cause oi the pro
blem, but no one was really sure how
to go about that. At one point, Brown-
ing jokingly suggested that the only
solution would be to install a closed
circuit television monitor system. No
one came up with a better idea.

After more discussion, the commit-
tee agreed to look iurther into the pro-
blem and postponed action until after
break,

Late start on heating

drastically cuts energy use

‘When the hell are they going to
turn the heat ant?" was a comment
made by many students this past
week. During the early part oi the
week, students frequently woke up to
rooms that were uncomiortably cold,
But the heat in the dorms is on.

Vice provost Ken Browning an-
nounced Wednesday that, aiter con~
suiting weather forecasts for the next
ten days which indicate that period
will be colder than normal, the ad
ministration had decided to turn heat

, on.

He said the reason the heat had not
been turned on earlier was that he
hoped to conserve as much energy as

possible. He indicated heat should
have been on in all or the dorms by
yesterday.

“We wanted to save as much energy
as possible," Browning stressed. “Up
to this point, we’ve only used 52% of
the amount of natural gas that we us-
ed in October last year." He estimated
that the savings is around 700,000
cubic feet of natural gas,

Although the heat will be on in the
dorms, Browning added. some of the
academic buildings will not yet be
heated. “Some at those buildings,
especially ARH. hold in the beat well
We won‘t need to turn on the heat in
these buildings until later," he said.

Bush campaign tries for Grinnell support

by Hal Hil/man

Last Tuesday, Jebb Bush, son of
presidential candidate George Bush,
spoke in South Lounge about his
iather's campaign. About 20 people at
tended the meeting,

Bush stated the three major pron
blems which his father believes are af~
(eating the U.S.: 1.) the U.S '5 lack of
international credibility, 2.) a
deteriorating economy (inflation) and,
3.) U.S. dependence on foreign coun-
tries ior energy sources. Bush says
that his father is best qualiﬁed to deal
with these problems due to his vast
experience.

Before entering politics, George
Bush started a successiul oil equips

4

ment firm. In 1966, he successfully ran
for Congress in Texas and in 1970 was
appointed to the post oi u.s am»
bassador t0 the United Nations, Bush
has also served as head of the
Republican National Committee, U,S.
liaison oiiicer to the People's Republic
of China, and worked for the C LA.

Bush said that his father's biggest
problem in the campaign was lack oi
name recognition This is because he
has “done nothing in a controversial
way," and this hurts because a can»
didate “can't win unless people know
you,"

George Bush is in iavor oi tax
credits ior users oi solar energy. but
is also [or continued use of nuclear

power. He supports strategic arms
limitations. but is against SALT
because he believes there is a problem
with U.S. verification oi Soviet are
maments.

Bush feels that “at this time the
volunteer army is sufficient,” but
favors reinstating the draft if it
becomes necessary. He is opposed to a
National Health Plan and lederally
tunded abortions iexcept in cases oi
rape, incest, etc.t

On a final note. Bush's son asked
that everyone get involved in the
presidential election, no matter who
they support. “Your vote is very lmr
poi-taut and you should care about
your government."
