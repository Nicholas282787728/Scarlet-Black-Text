Baby and I had to crawl out or Lhe
second story window to the boat. We
landed in a dry spot in Techou, which
happened to be right behind the
church. We had to unload the small

across the city to the canal I hope
that I never have to look on such a
scene of desolation again.

Many Are Drowned

The native mud houses loll down as

‘_soon as the water gets under the
ibnndations, and hundreds had fallen
down and the people had lied. The
report was that forty cl ﬁfty had al-
ready been drowned in Teohou. A
300d many at the streets were banked
up in a pitiful attempt to keep the
water out a little time. The walled
city was shut up and it was the south
suburb that was getting the water.
The people all gathered and followed
and asked if we were afraid and
where We were going.

' We have been lairly comfortable on
these boats. They are about 9 lest
Wide and about to feet long. There
are ﬁve boatmen, a Woman and a
child, two serwants, besides ourselves,
so you can imagine how crowded itis.
We have a sail, and [our men row all
the time, Paul packed that big Amer»

had one. When we started the boat»
'men asked for a ﬂag, as may wanted

no telling what the natives will do.

ODMPARESGERMAN WRITERS

Professor I'erl'illg Discusses Lilenl-
lure of Socialistic Authors

Present German SEAlEGrImllOSOd Upon
People by Alltocrlltic Govt, He Says

To condemn the whole German lit-
erature Since Goethe and Schiller
seems to cast aside the documents
which express the aims of the Gel--
nlnn people as contrasted with the‘
imperial government, ‘is the view 9
pressed by Prof. H. H. Pulling m
chapel Tuesday.

From the standpoint of a student
of German literature, hp defended the
socialistic writers, who “dug decpinto
the human heart and human society."
HQ said the present German state was
"not developed from and instituted by
the people themselves, but imposed
upon them by a government still re-
taining autocratic power.”

"Will the German people awaken to
their old-time social ideals and the

sense of their own i-ights?"-he asked
in conclusion.

Discusses Tuberculosis
Professor J. W. Gahnaway spoke in
chapel Monday on “Tuberculosis as
the Great Scourge of the War." He
suggested that students guard them-

Game Is Played at Drake Stad-
ium With Temperature
Below Zero

GRITINELLIANS ON BOTH TEAM;

Four Varsity Men on All-State
and Former Fresh Captain
on Army Team

The mythical alle tats» collegiate,
lootball tcaul suddenly assumed phys-
ital proportions aL Des Moincs last
Saturday and defeated the all-star
Camp Dodge team by a M score. The
game was played at the Drake Slad-
ium in a temperature that hovered
around the zero mark all during th
game. '

Four Gl'lullell men — Augustine
Watt, Osgood and Hoyt; played with
me ccllegians, and a former Grinnell»
lap, George Whitmcr, played with the
Camp Dodge'wm'rlors. Read or Iowa
had the honor of making the only
touchdown of the game in the third
period, alter his teammate, Green-
wood, had blocked a punt which rolled
over the army's goal line and which
Reed recovered for a touchdown.
Johnson of Morningside kicked -the
goal.

Watt ls Slur

Watt is mentioned with Johnson as
the star or the game. llis work as
defensive back was especially good,.
and he made the best showing when
it came to handling punts. He did
not fuillble a single punt, despite the '
extreme cold, and only once did be
{all to make at least a 5—yard return. '

One cl his returns was instl'umen‘
tail in securing the only score of the
game. Robertson of the army hunted,
and Watt tore off twenty yards before
he was downed, putting the bill] 011
the almy’s 30~yard line. ‘A play la—
millar Lo Grinnell tans—e forward
pass from Augusﬁne m. Wall—Was
good for eight yards, and on the next
play Lbs colleglans made il ﬁrst down
The army recovered a tumble on the
next play, but yore penalized otteen
yards, and Robertson was forced to
punt from behind the goal post, the
touchdown resulting when the kick
was blocked and Reed recovered

Not a Financial Succéss

The game was played to raise funds
fol the equipment of a gymnasium at
Camp Dodge, and was decidedly not
a success as far as receipts go, for
only a. few people attended the game, ‘
the cold weather keeping the crowd
away. As a football game, however,
it was a Corker, and fully justiﬁed

[the work of the men who had ’pro—
muted it.
