Canard Draws Attention
to Sunday Club Library

For the benefit of new students, Joe
Conai’d, president of the Sunday Even—
ing club, calls attention to the shelf
in the library containing books on
present economic conditions through-
out the world. The shelf is located
just inside the front door of the li-
brai‘y.

“The shell contains such books as,
‘The Unseen Assassins,’ by Nonnfm
Angell. This work discusses the poli—
cies of the nations of the world, which
tend to create social and economic
evils and to bring about war." Conard
states.

These books are available to stu-
dents duxing library hours. Accord-
ing to Conard they form the basis of
discussions at the club meetings, which
are held every Sinrday evening in the
associations building.

ested in hearing Prof. Charles E.
Payne, history department head, speak
on "The World We Face Today.” are

NOW I CAN GET MY
FAVORITE BRAND OF
CIGARETTES AT THE

White Spot

BEGINNING OCT. 1

OPEN DAY AND NIGHT

We stopped at Talbott's this
morning. We thought that the
idea of winding all of the alarm
colcks they had on the shelf
was quite a clever and novel
idea. 1t attracted quite a bit of
attention and sold several clocks.
We also noticed that they have
a special on Colgate soap. Six
bars are selling for twenty—nine
cents.

Penny's are planning a close-
out on most of their womons
formals. The manager showed
us some awfully cute dresses
that are selling in other stores
for as high as twenty dollars,
that Panney‘s are featuring _at
$4.98. This is a special price
and it is given only because they _
are planning to discontinue the
line.

Have you ever been in Bart—
ling and Nuckolls attractive
jewelry store? The fixtures are
reputed to be among the finest
in a store of its kind in lowa.
At the present we noticed that
(hey are offering cosmetics and
vanity cases at half price, and
some of them are really honey’s.

While in Mathews Rcrorll store
last week we sampled some or
Mrs, Stovers Bungalow Can»
dies, and we must admit that
for freshness and deliciousngss,
it surpasses most other Candies.
Boxes are selling for 55 and 75
cents a pound.

 

When you go to those football
games this fail you will appre.
ciate one of those woolen frocks
that are being sold at Virginia
Swisher‘s. They are chic, warin,
and comfortable. When you vrss
it the store, be sure to ask Miss
Swisher to show you her com.
plete line of school, afternoon
and formal dresses. if you felt
anything like we did you will
want to buy everything rn the
store.
