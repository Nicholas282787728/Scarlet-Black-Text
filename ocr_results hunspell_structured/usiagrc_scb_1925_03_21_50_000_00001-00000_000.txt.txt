SECOND WOMEN ’S DEBATE

Avengea' Dot it oi‘ (lrlllllcll N
by Quaker Affirmative rfrio at.
Osiruloo. Lust Week.

The Grinnell women’s affirmative
debating team, composed of Virginia
Hayes, Martha Hawley, and Ruble
Burton, avenged the recent defeat of

,their sisters by scoring a victory in
the audience's decision of the letul‘n
contest with a Penn college negative
team held in the n. n, H. auditorium
last Wednesday night. The question
under discussion was, “Resolved:
That the Japanese Exclusion Act
should be repealed in flwof‘ of the
Gentlemen’s Agreement."

The Penn negative team, composed
of the Misses Jennie Shaw, Mildred
Hammer, and Nellie Bass, put up a.
strong opposition case, and it was on-
ly by consistent work that the local
Women were able to win their case.

Virginia, Hayes, opening the case ef»
focljvely for the affirmative, establish.
ed the fact that the Japanese Exclus»
ion act and the Gentlemen’s Agree-
ment both look toward the same and,
since both exclude the same classes of
Japanese}, and both admltlthe same

, classes, and what the debate turned on
which method is the most advisable
under the present day conditions. This
was Miss Hayes' first. appearance on
a local debate platform, and her per—
formance was quite gratifying.

,Martha Hawley, also appearing for
the‘ first time on a. Grlnuell platform,
continued the constructive argument
in a highly satisfactory manner. Ruble
Burton in the final argument for the
local team showed improvement over
her splendid forensic work of last
year. ’ The contest was one of the
best clashes of opinion held on
the campus this year.

The decision was rendered by audlr
euce votes. in' accordance with the
Phi Kappa Delta system. wsich calls
for audience votes of opinion before
and following the debate. The de—
ci on was reached by counting the
changes of opinion in favor of each
team. The final score. thus comput-
er], was (3-26 in favor of the Grinnell
team.
