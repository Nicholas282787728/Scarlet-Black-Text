Mr. Leonard’s Pamphlet
(Continued [rout Secuiid l’ltgel
the pleasantest of thc impressions
received.

Anythinghlrcti complete renew
or the pztltiplilet can ltltidly be at-
tempted for these columns. In
gciierul, however, we may say that
the writer‘s emphasis is upon the
church, the school and the larnily
as the most important institutions
in the historical shaping, present
condition and future prospects of
[lie community. These with their
various modiﬁcations, tendencies
and related factors [arm the
groundwork or the study. The
writer is perfectly lair and candid
in his discussion of the church, sar
loon, railroad. club, etc , not ignor-
ing either the good or bad points
oi any at them.

The text is supplemented by
foot notes in the form of tabular
statements from the town records
and other sources; eleven half-
tones troui pliotugrapliS. most of
them very good, and three maps
constructed hythe writer. There
is an occasional eimr in typog-
raphy and one or two in syntax.
The style on the whole; however.
IS to be commended for its simr
plicity, directness and approprir
ateness to the matter and method
employed.
