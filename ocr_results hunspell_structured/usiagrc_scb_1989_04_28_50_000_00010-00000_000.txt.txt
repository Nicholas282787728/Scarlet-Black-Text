SCARLF‘T AND BLACK

by Matt Macho

You know, it’s really sad that
there are so many people with
James Dean posters and Stuff,
that the man’s still ti modern
cultural icon after being dead
more titan 30 years, and yet many
people haven‘t seen a single Dean
film. Those that have probably
haven't seen anything other than
the justly renowned Robe] with»
uni a Cause. Earl of Eden is an
unfairly neglected gem of Ameri-
can film.

This was Dean’s first feature
film, which launched him into
stardom after a brief period of
commercials, TV shows, and
Broadway plays. immediately
alter making Eden, Dean, clearly
hot property, went straight into
Reba-I Willioul a Cause. Shortly
thereafter, he made his last film,
Giant, and was killed in a car
crash before either of the latter
two films was even released. A

brief but very successful career.
Too bad we‘ll never get to see
what Dean would have done with
the role of Billy lhc Kid, which
he was scheduled to film before
his death.

Earl of Eden is a screen adap-
tation oi Steinbeck’s novel,
stripped down to a few basic and
very potent themes: love and es-
trangemeni in a family, and the
complex confusions of a young
man coming of age. Dean, as the
central character, tries to win the
love of his father, but is always
overshadowed by his brother. He
brings real pain to this role, and
his sullen. brooding. moody de-
meanor makes his violent out~
bursts of frustration all the more
striking.

Trivia buffs will be interested
to know that Dean beat out Paul
Newman for this role. Having
seen the screen test between the

The Untouchables

The Untouchables, while a
period film, does not faithfully
recreate Prohibitionrera Chicago,
but rather indulges in the legend
surrounding it all. Giorgio Ar-
mani dressed most of the cast.
creating a looser style based on
old 19305 gangster films. Di-
rected by Brian DePaIma (Dressed
to Kill. Body Double) and written
by playwright David Mamet, the
film is about Federal Agent Eliot
Ness‘ (Kevin Costner) war
against organized crime in
Chicago. Ncss, innocent and
somewhat clueless, learns up
with an older, Streetwise cop,
Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery).
They are jorned by a rookie cop
(Andy Garcia) and a govcmtnent
accountant (Charles Martin

Smith). Together they set about
trying to break mob leader Al
Capone‘s hold on the city.
Capone, played by Robert
DeNiro, runs the city with the
help of Frank Nitty (Billy
Drago).

The film centers around the
interaction of Ness’ group, their
loss of innocence, and their

adoption of crime’s own methods
in their quest to topple it. Crime
is made to look pretty. Capone
lives in a world he has created, or
rather bought, with all the ill-
gotten money he has come by.
But at the core, this world is
shown to be rotten and otnply.

two, I can say that as good an
actor as Paul Newman was, he
didn’t have mueL of a chance
against Dean. Dean was also
nominated for an Academy Award
for this role, the only actor to re-
ceive this honor posthumously.

This is your chance to see the
substance that makes Dean more
than a shallow sex symbol or ,
symbol of youthtul rebellion.
Ycah, he‘s superb as both of
those, but he was also a GREAT
actor, as Earl of Eden will attest.
Don't miss it.

Some tips: try to catch the
obscenities Dean says to provoke
his father during the Bible read-
ing, which are dubbed out. and
watch for some sexual innuendo
(In the ‘505, yell), especially in
the stearnbath scene.
