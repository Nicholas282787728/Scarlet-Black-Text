Hoopsters Crush Clarke
e of Season

in Final Gam

by Mike Marcketti

The 198188 basketball season
came to a victorious close Tuesday
[or Grinnell's women’s basketball
team with a 60-36 Victory over
Clarke. Hopes for next season were
looking bright as this year's cam-
paign climaxed with tour Victories
in the seven second-semester
games at Darby for the hard-
working Pioneers. This turnaround
was accomplished alter a dismal
2'14 beginning. Since this time,
however, the Pioneers have taken
hold of Coach Eskildsen’s system
and really played ball, After losing
to conference foes Coe. Cornell,
Monmouth, and lllinois College by
an average of 20 points a game the
iirst lime through the league‘s
roundvrobin play, Grinnell actually
outscored these four toes during
their second meetings. This is in
dicative 01' the improved style at
play the Pioneers exhibited
throughout the second semester.
With the Midwest Athletic Con-’
[erence’s leading scorer, Laura
VanSickIe, returning, along with
iellow starters Jessica Ten and
Amy Johnson, Grinnell can expect
to be in the midst of the ﬁrst
division battle next season.
Sophomore Tanya Hague and
lreshmen Mary Allenburg, Lisa
Ciersbach, Melissa Hayes, and
Jenniier Spremulii return to ease
the loss of the team's three seniors,

A resounding victory marked the
end ol their Grinnell careers for
these seniors. Shannon Carr,
Elizabeth MCJimsey, and Becky
Rate ended their careers in a
joyous fashion beiore a large Dar-
by crowd, The Pioneers exploded
to a solo lead with (our minutes to
go in the ﬁrst half behind a
tenacious blend of [ullrcourt man-
to-man presses and steals ignited
by aggressive halircourt play, The
outcome was never in doubt as
Vansickle scored 20 and MC.)
iinished with its points and 15 re
bounds. Rate and Toit kept
everyone happy by dishing out six
assists each, and everyone on the

team played great deiense, Cause
ing Clarke to shoot only 29 percent
for the game, Grinnell held leads
as large as so points in the second
hair while coasting to the 24-point
win.

Prior to this triumph, the team
missed a chance tor yet another
victory by simply picking the
wrong time to go cold. The
Pioneers could connect on only 17
oi their as shots tzs percent) Fri-
day night as lowa Wesleyan gained
revenge for .in earlier loss to Grin»

nell by a 33-51 score. Seniors Carr
and Mchmsey had good nights for
Grinnell as Shannon pumped in 14
points while Elizabeth had 10
points and 10 boards. VanSiCkle led
underclassmen with 15 points and
eight rebounds in the loss.

Congratulations to the whole
team tor the strong linish you en-
joyed through your hard work and
determination, and best Wishes to
the seniors in the ruture and to the
underclassmen tor a winning
season next year.

Lady Luck Absent as
Netsters Lose Final Two

by Bob Lifton

Some streaks just never end. But
anyone who witnessed either or the
Pioneers' heartbreaking losses
last Weekend can attest to the fact
that their [-21 season-ending
record is in no way indicative oi
their quality of play. Some guys
just don’t get any or the luck.

It’s a shame their season had to
end on such a sour note. Two wins
against Knox and lllinois College
would have signaled the rebirth of
a new team. No. they didn't win
tand thereby triple their season
output), but they easily could have
— losing both games by a total
margin or 5 points 7 which must
not go unnoticed. it only Lady Luck
could have dropped in during the
last couple of minutes. .

The Pioneers came out smokin’
Friday night, opening an dz lead

on the visiting Siwash. That spark
unfortunately quickly dissipated,
Knox's sharp passing enabling a
10-0 run which made it 12-8 with 11
minutes and 47 seconds leit to play.
The Pioneers were getting shot
alter shot, but they just weren’t
lalling in, which doesn't really
enhance the chance of winning.
This obviously was a frustrating
loss {or Grinnell, as they allowed a
107point lead to slip away at home,
While having 30 more shots than
their opponents, Grinnell only shot
39 percent (to Knox’s 57 percent)
irom the field. But the game was
really lost on the line in which
Grlnnell was only 5 {or 9, while the
visitors went 23 for 26 ill free
points. Right there is the game.
Saturday afternoon‘s game
opened in a completely opposite
way. but still ended in a deja-vu

last-second loss. lllinois College
started the ball game on a
Srpointer from the top oi the key
and never looked back, building up
a 13-5 run with 15 minutes to go in
the lirst half.

while the Pioneers did manage
to battle back behind consecutive
3-pointers by Chapko, l.C owned
the lirst halt. Six-{ootrfour forward
David Earhart paced the Blueboys
to a 44-27 lead, with soft turn-
arounds in the paint. Chapko's
steal and end-tarend lay-up with no
time on the Clock made it 44-31 for
the half. Not a very impressive
opening, to say the least.

Coach Westlund obviously said
something motivating in the locker
room because the Pioneers were a
dilterent ball club in the second
halt. it's too bad they were already
in a deep hole. As Westlund put it,
“If we played in the ﬁrst hall like
we did in the second, we easily
would have won that game.”

Chapko was again the team's
leading scorer, tinishing with 26.
He sank the last shot oi the game 7
the last jumper or his illustrious
college career, He was easily the
MVP at both games, reasserting
his team leadership in the clutch.
After the game, he told his coach
that he would gladly trade in his in-
dividual stats it it meant a team
victory. l-le meant it, too. i take my
