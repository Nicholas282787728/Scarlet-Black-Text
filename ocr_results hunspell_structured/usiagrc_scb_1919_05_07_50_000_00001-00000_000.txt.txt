I reached home late this eveningi
from a trip up _around Verdun. Coll
Chapman sent a may - along with us
and a i-ecncst to the breach army peo-
ple at the citadel saying we were poi»
scnal iriends aiid ask-mg that they.
show us the fortress which is not now
open to v' itois. There are great pa, t
sagcway and tunnels there and
underground rooms. it has an elec-
tric light plant. large baking plant
and rot gcrating plant, Also sup-
‘plies storrd to last 97.000 inch ior four
years. they told u it has big disair‘
pear g guns which are raised b3 mas
chiller) very rapidly and when [ll'ell
can cither be dropped out of sight or.
left to be tired again.
500.000 llulis Killed There.

It is said that 500,000 Gcimans lost
their lives there. It is on a large hill
and commands a view of all the coun-
try for miles. A wonderful place with
miles of underground galleries. They
claim they could accommodate 50.000

, people at one time. The town or Ver-
dun is about tweathll'ds destroyed.
Most of the inhabitants left. but are
commencing to come back now.

Then we were taken to another fort
which is very similar to the citadel at
Verdun with large guns which could
be raised andJowel‘ed automatically.
It also has galleries and tunnels un-
demeath. The Germans mined under
the tort tunnels and captured the
fort and held it several months. All
the country was covered with narrow
gauge tracks similar to those we use
in coal mines. They were used to
transport the cannon and supplies. We
got a line b seye view of all the
surrounding country. The whole coun-
try has been mined and counterinined‘
and in some places had fallen in. l

They took us thru the Argonne Fowl
est where the heavy ﬁghting was zllid‘
we could see trenches, tlmncls.‘ dlgr
outs and harb \vi‘l'c entanglements
everywhere We drove llirtr places
where there used to be cities ot sev-
eral thousand people and not a house
of any kind standing. One place had
a sign stuck up that it was the site
at a town but that was all there was

Prospects of Victory Brighten-

Gt-iuncll cinder artists have hecn
working hard this week in prepara-
timt for the dual meet with Ncbi a
which i. scheduled to be held here
next Saturday afternoon. If this rucet
can he turned into a victory it means
' d chances [or the Conference

. since they emerged from the
Allies dual last week with a trium-
phant lead of twelve points. '

Altho advance dopc on the strength
of the Cornhuskers is rather scarce.
the chances are favorable that Grin-
nell will carry off me burden of non-
ors in the sprints. quarter-mile, hur-
dles and relays.

Hass, running in true form. should

with Cowden it close second in each
event. The first We places in the
quarter should go to Captain Minty
and Crane. both being exceptional ltd
mun. Providing that Vinsel rounds
into condition he can be counted on
tor points in the high hurdles. jumps
and pole vault. stock can also be
counted on for points in the same
events.

The half-mile relay can be conceded
to Grinncll. Evans will probably take
care or the lows. which leaves the dis-
tances and weight events debatable.
It the western team displa, s strength
in those. the outcome of the meet will
be doubtful.
