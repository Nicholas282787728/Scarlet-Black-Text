Responses to KDIC Incident

Student Affected

To the Editor:

Collins,Steinman Explain Actions

To the Editor:

Last Saturday night i listened to
two KDIC shows between 3:30 and
9:30. in the iirst show, the 1315
played rap music. Even though i
usually do not listen to rap, i listen
ed anyway. “Why not a pleasant
change or pace?” i thought. Pleas
sant it was not. The lyrics
repeatedly reierred to women as
bitches and whores, and alluded to
women as sexual objects whose
sole purpose in life was to gratiiy
men's sexual desires.

Apparently there were other
listeners who did not care ior the
music and who called KDIC to
complain that it was oiiensive. As i
remember, the DJs responded on
the air with comments such as,
“Now we’re gonna play something
that will really make you shit,”
and, “It's a sad iact oi liie that
women are too iucking weak to
know what it (rap) is all about.”

WRONG! With a little education,
I think could I learn to better
understand rap music. But what i
will NEVER understand is What
elicited such crude and disrespect-
ful remarks from the DJS.

When I called KDIC, the respon-
dent told me to turn the channel.
True, I could turn the channel or
turn off the radio. But what I can’t
turn off, and What affected me the
most, was the poor attitudes of the
ms.

fellow Grinnellians. I‘m not
writing today to put down any one
person or anyone‘s taste in music.
Rather, I'm writing to put a iace on
one of the listeners of last Saturday
night and to remind these DJs that
people do hear what you say on the
air and are affected by it — I know
I was. 7 Dorothy shearn '88.

To the Editor:

1 am writing to respond to come
merits made on the air last Satur-
day night during Bill Collins and
Dave steinman's show irom o to 9
pm. and Brian Berger’s show
from 9 to 12. Although I did not
hear the comments as they were
broadcast, I listened to a recording
oi Brian's show and read the come
ments made on Bill and Dave's
show that were written down by
listeners.

This was the situation as I now
understood it. Several listeners
Called to tell the DJs that they
iound a particular song oiiensive.
Rather than responding to the
callers' comments privately over
the phone, the people in the studio,
without giving their names, pro-
ceeded to attack the callers Over
the air. Among other things, they
stated that “it's a sad fact oi life
that you [women] are too iuckmg
weak to know what it’s [rap musici
all aboul.,,Now we are going to
play something that will really
make you shit.” The listeners were
told that if they didn't like what
they were hearing, they could

change the channel.

For a while i thought it might be
better to address my complaints
directly to the people who made
the comments latter all, DJ Brian
Berger warned his listeners that
unless they were “pussies,” they
sh uld take their complaints
directly to the people who made
them). Aiier some deliberation.
however, i decided that because
our radio station chose to broad
cast the oiiensive remarks to the
entire listening audience, it is only
appropriate that i use our
newspaper to express my reac-
tions.

Despite what you might have
been thinking, your supposed
anonymity over the radio and the
anonymous nature oi a public
listening audience does not mean
that your comments did not anger
and oiiend people. i, ior one, can
tell you that your remarks were
heard and repeated and that they
oiiended many people, both male
and iemale.

Yes, you have every right to play

The social upheuvni caused by
our radio show Saturday, April
ii has caused us to think about
some oi the issues at hand. Tire
manner in which the criticism
toward our show has progressed
has brought to our attention
the uccd for this letter. in
the past iew days we have been
publicly scrutinized and judged
without being sought out (or an
explanation oiany kind. Obvi-
ously, when censorship ois radio
sliow's music is demanded and
the personal views oi the 131's
toward the subjccl matter are
questioned, actually conironiing
ilicsc DJ‘s is out oi the ques-
tion. Not only afterward, but
during our show, the complaints
demanding retraction and opol-
ogy registered toward our nme
sic were anonymous or directed
ciscwiiere.

Oilr rnp show had become one
oi the most widely listened to
shows on [(DIC, strictly iollow-
ing with tlrc proiessicnslism and
tight iormatting deemed neces-
sary by the how stnﬂ'and ad
ministration. The event which
initiated this disturbance was a
rcqucst ior a rap song entitled
“We want some Fussy..y..y“ by

.The Two Live Crew. Before the

song completed its air time siit
to right phone calls, all from
women hail been received. All
objecting to the apparcnt alien-
siveness oiihc song and irrost de-
manding rctructions and ml the
air upologies. Now unics's Edwin
Meese has been here recently,
music is still on art form ailzl
its. air plny slinuld not be de-
ternrined lay its lyrical content.
The sole basis of rap music as

an art iorrn lies in the stories oi
urhnn lire ii projects. Perhaps
many oiyou did not realise most
rap artists do not exactly come
hour the richest suburbs in the
U.S. Even white artists such as
the Beastie Boys have had most
oi their experiences with blacks
in “urban jungles“. The urban
jungle thrives on the pains and
passions oiscx. This is tlrcu re
ilccicd iu the music from these
arcas which predominately dcals
with sexually explicit activities
and, tliereiorc, can be alien-
sive to those who do not imilrr-
stirnd the intuit content of the
lyrics. in tact, these views are
expressed in much oi the music
oiicmslc rappers as well. There
iore, one cannot plan on listen-
ing to a rap show and expect
the sweet lyrical messages oi Li-
oncl Richie's “Still“, Billy Jot-1’s
“An innocent Man", or Bach
or Beethoven's symphonies. Ex-
plicit oil'ensivrness is inhcrcnt in
rep nmsic and should be under
stood by its listening audience,
consequently, the vehement ob-
jertimis that we rcceivcd were
answered according to what we
ieli was an attack on our show
and the music program we were
trying to provide to the corn-
pus.- Aiter receiving more phone
rolls, we were prompted to make
a comment about “the weakness
oi women" and their uinability
to understand". This comment
was not dirccted at any group
in particular, but it was a gene
crnlircd statement reﬂecting the
tart that all oi the complaints
were irom women. Our analy»
sis of this situation would hnve
bcen diiicrcnt had all the calls
not been from women.

Even so, our opinions on
Women are just that, our opin-
ions and a “liberal" institution
such as Grinncli should realize
this and acccpt our right to that
opinion. it was a generalized
statement made about Grinncll
college women and it was not
mosut to be cruel or vindictive
in any manner. it taken as such
we sincerely apologize. This
outcry against us seems lo be
another cxample oikneejcrk in—
tolcrauce oi ihe sen—proclaimed
“open-minded" at our iiistitu~
tion ior those whose opinions
which diii'cr hour the “enlight-
encd views".

Granted some oi the language
used was in violation oi FCC
regilatious because of the vul-
gnrily and for ilris and this only
should we be punished.

Stated opinions are not such
a violation. Those oil'cndcd
could merely change the star
lion, much like preicrring not

to buy that Playboy behind the
counter. With the exccp Eon oi
the proruuity, oiir show u,d not
exceed ilic level oi proicssional-
ism so denrly sought aitcr by the
Kch stair.

Believe it or not, we would
like to extend our iuosi sincere

‘apologies to all of you who Were

offended by our language. And
we hope that you can imd it in
your hearts to forgive us ior any
offense you might have taken
with our show.

Respectfully,

SP&R Committee Addresses
Events and Ramifications

To the Editor: ,

On Saturday, April 9, over a
period oi several hours, KDICVFM
ans, Grinnell College’s student
radio station, broadcast material
that was oiiensive to many people
in our listening area, including
women, gays, Native Americans.
and blacks,

The Grinnell College Student
Publications and Radio Commit-
tee. along with the management oi
KDIC, is deeply troubled that peo-
ple in our audience were victimiz-
ed by vrolent and graphic music
and comments. The individuals
responsible tor the broadcasts in
question were violating ethical
codes by using public airwaves to
broadcast their opinions about
other groups without identiiying
their comments as editorial. The
comments made by these in.
dividuals in no way represent the
views oi Grinnell College, 5? and
R, or KDIC station management
nndstall.

KDIC and SP and R do not con
done and will not permit this type
oi irresponsible behavior, For this
reason the 51> and R Committee,
along with station management,
has ordered that the station cease
broadcasting eiieciive at midnight
on Monday, April 11, and that it re-
main oii the air until Tuesday,
April is, at 7 arm

We realize the implications and
severity oi these intolerant and op-
pressive comments made on the
air. The comments that were made
affect not only the audience listen-
ing at the time oi the broadcasls,
but also the college community,
the city oi Grinnell, other potential
listeners, and any members oi the
groups spoken against.

We take this issue very seriously
and have therefore made the deci-
smn to shut down KDIC.

This decision is in no way intend
ed to punish the individuals in
question; they have already been
permanently suspended. This decir
sion also was in no way intended to
punish other disc jockeys tor the
actions of a few. Rather, SP and R
and the KDIC management took
this action as a means of recogniz-
ing the severity oi this issue and as
a means of making others aware of
these oppressive, intolerant acts
We ieli that mere disciplinary ac
tion against the individuals involw
ed could not begin to amend the
wrong that was done, We thereiorc
took this action as a gesture oi
silence in the wake of violent com»
menls, and as a gesture of respect
to any individuals who may have
been offended by the broadcasts
that occurred,

This action is also a gesture

recognizing the iact that although
KDIC is a college radio station and
not a commercial one, there are
still rules and regulations which
must be followed. These acts
violated all protessional ethics and
Lire destructive to the credibility
that SP and R. KDIC station
management, and several DJs
have been trying to increase over
the past years.

Additionally, the decisroh to sus-
pend broadcasting oi Koic was
made entirely by the undersigned
students. The administration in no
way suggested this action, nor
were they involved in the decision.
Please be assured that those
responsible for this incident are be-
ing dealt with by Grinneli College
and that the Student Publications
and Radio Committee is working
with station management to pre
vent such an incident from ever Der
cur-ring again

We apologize for any inconver
nience that this Creates for Our
listeners, but vie hope that they
will appreciate the gravrty oi the
situation and the significance of
this gesture — Stephanie Redman.
