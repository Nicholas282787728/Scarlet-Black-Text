Imbued with the spirit of patriotism, and backing President Wilson

Theirs was thc first to go up in Griunell after President. \Vilsun’s stop in

The Preston Hails“ men have shown quite a spirit oi loyalty during the
past week. Frequently they have sung war songs, and have practised war
speeches. Also they have continued practising their regular morning drills.

Pointing out that the greatest 'lneu‘
in history, were of the races held in‘

disfavor by some Americans, he said,
“Do we Americans consider ourselves;
better than the ‘dago' or the 'sheeny'
or the ’Jap'i' God help our littlenessl ;
If America is no larger than that, may
Heaven wipe out America and give us

First Time For Milli .

The number of ministers in attend
once at the conference cannot be ex—
actly ascertained, as it was impossible
to keep an accurate record of regise
trations, but the management esti-.
naates the number as approximately
eighty. lt is a notable fact that a con-
siderable portion of this number had
not attended a previous conference,

One of the best received numbers of
. the extensive program was the concert
offered to the members of thc confers
encc by the faculty of the School of-
Music, assisted by the college choir. :

Giro Encores.

The chorus was accorded a very
hearty appreciation, as was also the
trio—violin, organ, and piano_ pl'e»
sented by Mr. Scheve, Mr. rock, and
Miss Rogers, in one oi Prolessorl
Schcvc's compositions. Mr. Dotte‘rr
wcich and Miss Heldel' were enthusi-
astically received, both being forced to
give encorcs.

In connection with the eoiilerence,l
was the annual meeting of the Board
of Directors, which dispensed with the
customary routine business.

Greatest Appreciation rel.

Pi-oicssoi- doc and Dr. Herring seemv
ed to prove a delightful combination.
and those two with Pi-oicssor Ropes
formed a trio whose work received the
greatest appreciation given to any;
group ct speakers in the history of the
conference.

“liist- s Should Conic back."

"One of the fundamental rights of
man," he declared in his lecture, “is
the right to make mistakes; but the
mistake should come back to the one
that makes it. It is undemocratic to
it it the responsibility or any class on
one [DEF-Son."

The more noticeable social events or
the conference were the reception at
[our-thirty Wednesday in the Associa—
tion parlo- and a dinner on the same
evening at the Women's Quadrangle.

The cast of “The Adventurer," which

Owing to the fact that the play is

names oi the character as r it as
many other important details can not
be given out. This is the first time
that a play has been translated di-
rectlyby any department for presen—
tation here. When the translation is
finished within a few day it will be

directing the production.
Was Postponed.

This play was to have been present
ed at an earlier date, but was post.—
poned in order to fit in with the high
school basketball tournament which
ends the same evening. As usual the
visiting high school men will be guests
ol the two societies at the play.

"The Adventure " a romantic coins
any of modern life, was written by a
Frenchman, Alfred Capos. It was first
produced at the Porto Saint Martin
theater in France during 1310. It was
received with as much popular clamor
as was Rostznt‘l's "Chanteclair" which
had been presented at the same thea-
ter only a short time before. At all
times Alfred Capiis has been well res
ccived by the Parisien audiences.

Differs From “The Mob."

Capus has shown himself to he a
realist, very original, very calm, and
far seeing. rte is one of the contemp—
orary dramatists and his play presents
certain types within society whose in-
fluence on society is dangerous and
who we must know it we are to block
them. He is, nevertheless vcry opti-
mistic as to lite, in contrast with “The
Mob" this play is a} very pleasant, ens
tci-taiiiing, modern comedy or man-
ners.

—T“‘0 SIIII Eclipses Will Be
Seen From U. S. A.

Seven eclipses, the greatest number
possible in one year, will be seen from
the earthdn 1917, according to Prof.
W. J. Rush. Of these four will be
lunar and three solar. One other com-
bination of seven eclipses is possible,
that of five of the sun and two of the
moon in st year. There have noL been
iseven eclipses in any year since 1805.

Not since 1737 have there been three
ieclipses of the moon in one year. It
lis possible only when one occurs very
close to the beginning of the year, and
ltbc sun has time enough to swing
iaround and again reach the same node,
ltwice more within the year. In 1787
lthe eclipses occur d January 3, June
30, and December 24. This year one
took place January 7, and the others
will be Jilly 4 and December 27.

Coe is in a fighting mood and is
coming to Grinnell today determined
to win over the so let tits and thus
get into the running for the center»
cncc honors once more. Grinnell proSs
pects of a victory suddenly increased,
however, when “Mike" Augustine ape
pear-ed last night ready to play the

The Goo Cosmos realizes the im-
portance of tonight's clash, and in
this week's issue devotes considerable
space to dope on the game. The mix
is spoken of as “perhaps the most imr
poi-taut conference game of the sea—
son. 0n the outcome of the game Sat—
urday night depends Coe's last hopes
for any sort of a claim whatever, eithr
or from a percentage or comparative

The crimson and gold is primed tor

the best shape of the year. Yulll and

in first class condition, and the return

Mexican border, has strengthened the

not'hod a chance since his return to

held with a great feeling of confidence
by all concerned."

tonight’s game places Rogers or Gil-

wards, and Martin and Frank at
guard. Kegley is also sure to get into
the game at forward.
“Mike" Will Play.
