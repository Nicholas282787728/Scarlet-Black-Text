Players Present "So/id" Show

“The Lady's Not for Bur pg"
by Christoph Fry was 1 o-

to students who lound it a wel-
come and ieircshing change
from the usual drab amusements
ottercd by college and town.

To criticize the Flaye
fort according to pi-ote
standards would be unrealistic
and unfair. for the viewer must
bear in mind that acting is not
the principal interest 0[ the stu-
dents who participate in college
productions, and great amounts
oi time and money cannot be
altordcd to provide the best
sets and technical ciiects. How-
ever, I do believe that criticism
is iustilied when it attempts to
point out what might have been
achieved within the limitations
which the college situation im-
poses.

, John Ward was well cast in
the port of Thomas Mcndip
and should be praised for his
adroit control ot Fry’s drunk»

:1 tendency (0 allow his lines ‘

to overshadow his emotions,
especially in the romantic
scenes with Jet-net (Gretchen
Geycrl.

Miss Geyer gave us a most at.
tractive and- appealing witch
who; like Ward, was more than
adequate in her mastery of the
language of the play. it she
deserves to be criticised at all,
it was because of herinahiltty
to_.,cinphasiaedthe humorous as-
pects at her role and to make
her character lighter.

Barbara Hansen gave a credit:
, able-pe‘riormanee as Margaret
and gave her character such
consistency as to make it be-
lievable and extremely funny,
It was ditticult to believe, how—
ever, in the stolid unconccrn
she exhibited during Mcndip's
rough treatment of her elder
brother; she didn’t even wince
as the bucket wcnt over
head.

Spmking of the elder brother,
the good mayoi‘ Tyson, portray-
ed by Alva‘h Stanley, the review-er
wonders whether Fry concleved
his character in the way in
which Stanley portrayed it. On
reading the play, i fell: that if
one part in the whole thing
should be played straight, it
‘should be that of the mayor.

He represented to me a solid
member of the upstanding
bourgeois with the courage of

his ‘

‘llis muddlcshcaded. convictions:
scarcely the snivelling syncho»,

Admittedly he did well h his
Ich‘aracterization, and thi
type Stanley does best.
