To Our Friends

and Customers-

Your clothing needs are always
foremost in our minds, and it is that
which prompts us to call these facts to

your attention.

Times today are critical. Armies of
millions must be clothed, blanketed and
taken care of with unlimited amounts
of woolen yarns. New wool for domestic
consumption must be and is being ra-
tioned to all woolen mills, to such an ex—
tent (40% of last year’s quantities) that
we feel that by next fall or sooner,
clothing will not be up to standards pre-
viously enjoyed by American clothing

buyers.

Clothing that we have in stock now
and the balance of our spring 1942 pur-
chases, contracted for last October and
November are all 100% New Virgin
wool, all good sound merchandise as yet
unadulterated by shortages.

It is with these facts in mind and in
all sincerity that we urge you as friends
and customers to take care of at least
your near future requirements in the
clothing and furnishing needs as soon

as possible.
