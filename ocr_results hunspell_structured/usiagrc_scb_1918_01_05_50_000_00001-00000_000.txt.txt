The basket ball schedule as given
above, although not entirely approved
as yet, makes one of the hcstschedules
that Grinnell has had for years. The
Iowa games and two games with the
university of Nebraska are still pend-
-ing and will be arranged the part of
next week.

The ﬁrst three games for the team
will be played on the home door as
scheduled now. These will he three
stiif games from present indications.

Will Play Soldiltrs

The season will be closed with the
‘camp Dodge' game at Camp Dodge,
which will undouhtediy be the hardest
game, Kasper, (ex-’19, has been play-
lng on the Camp Dodge team, and the
rest of the team can be counted on to
be all-stars.

The squad practiced all during vaca-
tion and all are back with the excep»
tion of ‘lilike Augustine, who will be
back the ﬁrst of next week. About ﬁf-
teen men are reporting regularly.

Sophs Are Good

All of last year's freshman team
looks good to Coach lilacEachron, and
several of them can be counted on.for
surEIberths. Garner, Hammond and
Gsss, all of them last years yearlings.

, are showing up especially well in
practice. The Daubenbei-gers, Stock
and Sauerrnan are putting up strong

’ competition. Bagge ‘19, who made his
“G" last year, will be eligible next se-
mester.

The seniors are furnishing a large
number of strong candidates for the

. guard positions, as the forwards will
probably be drawn from the other two
classes.

Because the war conditions are like-

thought advisable to choose four were

custom in the past.

Y. M. and Goodilow
Closed to Save Fuel

In order to conserve coal during the

-esent coal crisis, the college has de-
cided to temporarily close the Asso»
ciation building and Goodnolv hall.
Only the physical laboratory _in Good»
now will be heated Tuesdays, Wednes-
days and Thursdays. The other classes
will be held in the Library and in
Alumni recitation hall. Physics
classes \ ll go to the Library, and
mathematics classes to the recitation
hall.

Mr. Goodrich has secured some ad.
ditional coal and has prospects of a
little more. unless the weather grows
exceptionally severe, he expects that
no further measures will be needed?
The men and women should conserve
all the heat possible and prevent all
waste, he has pointed out.

The Congregational church lust Thurs—
day evening, under the auspiccs of the
collc'ge lecture ccul-sc committee. He
discussed our case against Gel-many
thoroly and convincingly, and proved
that it was impossible for us to have

furthermore that Germany must be

Than Before

“Don't make the war an excuse to
give up your regular work in college.
Young men will find that the class-
room work and college degrees are
even more important than before the
War."

This is the message that former
President William H. Taft Wanted lo
leave with the students of Grinnell,
and with college students everywhere,
as expressed in an interview Thurs-
day afternoon.

Stay In College.

Taft expressed his belief that men
under 21 should go to college as long
as possible in order to fit themselves
to meet the national call. He particu-
larly urged in addition that students
now in college should realize and
make the most of their exceptional op»
portnnities,

“We find a fine type of patriotism
in our colleges," the former president
declared. “The men are at an ideal-
istic age. There are re ' slackers.
At the opening of the war ollr stud-
ents followed the example of the men
at Oxford and Cambridge, and great
numbers entered all branches of the
service.”

the whole Potsdam crew. When we
have defeated them, they will relegate
the Potsdam crew to the place they
ought to go,”

Mr. ’l‘al‘t spoke of the complete
change, that has come over the Ger-
man peoplc. He stated that it was
hard to realize how much the mass of
the Germans had been transformed
They have been wonderfully success—
ful, and success has turned their
heads.

’l'lle Geruinll Obsession

"Kultur is necessary- for the conver-
sion oi the world,” he continued sar-
castically. "It is God's purpose. No
other consideration of terrestrial kind
can interfere with the spreading of
Kultur. It leads to this fact: that
there is no international morality.

“The Germans have become ob-
sessed with the insane idea that they
are the children of God and better than
other men. They forgive anything in
the conduct of the war because it is-
to achieve victory for God,"

"Years hence our grandchildren will
ask, ‘Why in the name of common
sense did Germany force the United
states into this warm on we will have
a hard time answerin . They have
driven into the war this giant young
nation thdt can contribute more inop-
ey, more food and more men than any
other nation in.the world."

Reviews Events

Starting with the declaration of war
in 1914. Mr. Taft reviewed the series
of events prior to our break with Ger-

“Down to the time of the Lusi-
tania, we had done nothing of any
kind that had violated our duty as a
neutral nation."

Mr. Taft discussed the history of the
German nation. He showed the devel-
opment of the "blood and Iron” spi
from the time of Bismarck, and re
viewed the militaristic policies that
have ruled Germany since his time.
Their failure in this war is one not to
their milita strategy and mi tarism,
which has been perfect, but is due to
the fact that they disregarded the mor-
ality of other nations
