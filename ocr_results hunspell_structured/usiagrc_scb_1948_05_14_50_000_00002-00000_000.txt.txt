Idea Exposure

Grinnell has again demonstrated the
liberality of its educational attitude, The
recent writers conference and the industrial
relations lecture series, by bringing to the
campus a wide diversity of opinion, greatly
enhanced and supplemented the students
regular academic instructions This expos-
ure to ideas that may not be in accord With
one’s own is an important part of college
training.

The writers conference featured Messrs
Ciardi, Lieber, and Cazamian. Mr. Clardl, a
professor at Harvard, pointed out the ad—
vantages of college training to the would-be
author, while Mr. Lieber, a literary agent,
indicated that no college trained Writer
ever amountsd to a “hill of beans". Mr.
Cazamian spoke on the role of the critics in
literature.

In the industrial relations series the
position of management was expressed by
Mr. Lannam, of the local shoe factory, Mr.
Maytag, of washing machine fame, and Mr.
Sllelmn, of Hormel. Labor’s attitude was
explained by Mr. Henry, regional CIO di-
rector, Mr. Berman,of the machinists un-
ion, and Mr. Finnessy, publicity director for
the local A. F. of Li office.

The students’ appreciation of the ef-
forts of the faculty to put on a good show
was indicated by the numbers that attend-
ed. A hearty vote of thanks to those who
made these conferences possible.

Editorial Reply

Since the publication of last Week‘s
“State of the Union” editorial, it has come
to the attention of the editorial board that
there is a good deal of student restlessness,

H“—
yea, verily, almost an uprising, about the
stand the S. & B. apparently took on “fifty
cents an hour.”

The facts are still true that the Pio—
neer Pub needs waiters, that we all spend
time enjoying the Union, and that many
could easily Work for a few hours and be
receiving a regular income for it,

It is still true, however, that many
students who do hold student employment
do so not because of altruistic desires to
see the rest of the student body happy With
its coffee, but because they need money.
To these, the question of fifty cent wages
remains a very important one, quite apartl
from the Union issue.

Letters To
The Editor

Dear Editor:

1 wish to comment on the edi-
torial published last week, May
7, 1948, entitled “State of the
Union," It was neither inspiring
nor fsir. It displayed a lack on
the part of the author of the
true picture of the problem that
exists in the Student Union.

I do, however, question the in-
tention oi the author in writing
the article, for the Student Un-
ion has a labor problem, and
this problem IS getting worse
with time. i think he was right
in Wanting to do something about
the problem, but surely there is
a less hackneyed means of ar-
ousing “Grinnell Spirit"

Here I would like to ask these
questions: what is “Grinncll
Spirit?” is it something that may
be held like a. club over the
head ci a student who Cannot see
eye to eye with the masses fol-
lowing blindly behind a leader?
Or is it that guiding light which
a student uses in solving his
problems with judgement? These
questions I leave unanswered.

I do not believe that the
"Grinnell Spirit“ is something
that needs constant restatement
by every presumed authority of
the subject on this campus, but
I believe that it is much more
intangi‘hle than the spoken or
writtEn word. It is not, in my
opinion, a breach of loyalty to
Grinnell when a student refuses
to work for the present pay
rate even in the Student Union.

Earlier inihis letter I referred
to the fairness of the edit/31131
in last week's papelt i believe

 

that the person who pencilsd
"For fifty cents an hour? Not
me!” on the plea for help should
not be reprimanded for he recog-
nized the heart, or the coreifyou
will, of the problem involved

While the humor of the editorial
did not.

I will venture to say that most
of the students who work in the
Union work not because they
want to work. but because they
have to work. They deprive them-
selves of study time which is
in a long run, more valuable
than the fifty cents per hour
they receive now,

Why is it more valuable? Be
cause instead of being able to
relax in their spare moments,
the student:workers must force
themselves to study with tired
minds, often into the early hours
of the morning to prepare hap-
hazardly assignments that repre-
sent them as students in com~
petition with those students who
do not work. The most unfair
part of all this being that they
must wait four months before
they receive the benefits of their
lalbors.

Grinnell has in its Student
Union a labor problem in its
minor form. The refusal of the
college, in this case the employ—
cr, to solve this problem either
by raising wages or by hiring
full time help is faced with a
substantial loss since the Union
has had to close its doors two
Saturday nights in succession.

Labor problems in this institu-
tion as in any other cannot be
solved by referring to that in~
tangible atmosphere or attitude
of mind possessed by its members.
A student's labor is worth as
much as anyone else’s.
