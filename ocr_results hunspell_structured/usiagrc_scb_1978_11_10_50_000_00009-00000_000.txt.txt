Bogie and Bacall burn up the screen

by Larry Pinder
If ever a weekend oi film at

Grinneii held something for every ‘

taste, this one does, We're offered
a domestic classic, a recent
French favorite and a work of the
Japanese new wave to distract us
from our studies.

fans for some time Bogart is
paired here with his wife, Lauren
Bacall. Their scenes together are
hardly examples oi typical con-
nubtal bliss: no one before or since
has heard a married couple
communicate in such sultry
dialogue

There is a legend about how
these dialogues came about
Director Howard Hawks is said l0
have pulled Bacall aside early in
the production and told her of his
ambition to put hot dialogue on the '
screen. These scenes were a
problem, he told her. because
Bogart was al the time “the most
insoleiit sonrofrarbltch” in film.

character even more audacious
than Bogart's. Hence the classic
scene in which Bacall shows Bugle
how to whistle.

The plot is reputedly taken
from Hemingway, though not too
faithfully. Bogart plays the
mercenary captain oi a ship who
gets wrapped up in World War ll,
Also on hand are Walter Brennan.

Going Places (1974) is something
of a morality fable directed by
Bertrand Bliers and written by
Bliers and Phillippe Dumarcay it
features Gerard Depardieu and
Patrick Dewaere as two funrloving

and lusty youths who spend their ,

lives shoplifting, swiping cars and
pretending affection for middle-
aged shoppers. Their only concern
is a iugitive care for each other.

Penelope Gilliatt says the moral of
the piece is that ”a shabby society

 

run by rules of haphazard greed
will naturally produce shabby
young citizens in the grip of the
same havoc." Blier's perverse
sense ufhumor is, one critic says, a
sort oi existential shock therapy.

Filmed in 1964 by Hiroshi
Teshigahara, Woman oi the Dunes
tSuiia Voyoiiiiat is an allegory of
modern life. A young entomologist
is talked into spending a night in a
shack in a small Japanese village.
in the shack he finds a sand pit
tended by a widow whose endless
task is to shovel away the sand
hauled in on a rope. The next day
he finds he cannot leave, and his
hostility eventually gives way to
attraction and he becomes the
woman's lover and helper.

not be. Even it Japanese schlnck-

disappointed with Smithfor two
reasons, First. Grey points out that
Smith “as here to talk about and
analyze "lhc causes and coir

anecdotes \iliicll can he found in

that the speech was long on
