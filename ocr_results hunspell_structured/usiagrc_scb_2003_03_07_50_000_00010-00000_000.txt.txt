Monday mornings ar rhe Sainrs Resr are hardly rowdy, bur
owner Jeff Phelps 73 is aimosr always ralking ro someone This
morning, (he ropio wandered amiably deprnding on rhe cusrom.
crs. One woman picked up a ﬂier advernsrng a new greenhouse
drai will be opening in Aprd. She asked Phelps abour ir and he
roid her rhar rhe porred planrs dcooraring oreh rable are from rho
greenhouse. The man who dropped rhem oir was one or Phelps'
high school classmarcs.

Since Phelps has grown up, gone ro school, raised a family and
opened iwo business: in Grinneu, his hmiliadry wirh pretty much
everyone who walks rhrough rhc door is nor entirely surprising.
Whar is surprising is Phelps' admission dizr he never really meanr
ro hang around rhis long,

While growing up in Grinnell, Phelps wasn’r parriculariy con-
neered ro rhe college; he only ivonr ro campro ror baskerball games.
“I never rhoughr Iwas going ro go ro Grinneli, 1r was such a rough
school ro ger inro and had such a grear
reputation." he said. He would rather have
gone ro Universiry or ioiioi, where all his
friends were going if ir hadnr been for a
rarhor large incenrive. My parenrs lirer-
ally bribed me wirh a sporrs car. They
boughr me a lirrleTriumphTR»3 1le go
to Grinncll."

Because Phslps' morherworkcd in the
Treasurer's Office, his ruirion was, he said,
just $50 in books. Between the car and
an essentially free odricarion, Grinnell was
a good deal.

However, there were orhei obstacles
to contend with. Asked about his first im-
pression of the college, Phelps answered. “Fear." He rclzred rho
srory of his hrsr iioor mooring, during which hc discovered rhar
nor only was he rho only one rhcrc who wasii'r a Fiisr Class scour,
he was rho only one ho wasn’r an Eagle scour.

Bur despite his initial intimidation, Phelps soon fell in love
wiih rho college. “Oncei ser {nor on campus, more all n rook. lusr
having rhe rest ofrhe world come ro Grinneli was such an nmaz»
ing experience," he said. “Everybody wanrod ro know whar ir was
like to be a Grinncllian, just like I waiircd to know what 11 was like
ro be from New York or Chieago or places liko rhar."

Phclps has no qualms admirring rhar rho social aspoer was or
paramounr impornnse fol him. “Lot: of proiesrs, iors ordrugs,
lots oimusie," is Phelps iinapoiogcric Summary orhis enllcgc yer-us.
"Evan rhough 1 was a lousy sriidenr, 1 had absolurely no regrers
about my time at Grinlicll," he said. “I Sllll feel like I learned, I N“
learned different things."

Phelps was a lousy enough student ru ger kicked our in 1970,
his rhird year ar crinnoll. During whar ended up being a rempo.
mry sabbatical from Grliincll, Phelps married in: wife, Patricia.
and moved to the Sr, Charles, Miss. area, where he started taking
classes or Lindcnwood, a oommunrryoollrge. “nor was redlywheie

dcmically," he said, “bemuse I did almost less work at Liiidenwood
than I did at Grinncll and gorAs find Bx."

Newly niorivared ro rake advanrago or rhe opporrunirics
Giiniicll ochrcd, Phelps returned in 1972 to ﬁnish his degree in
psychology “When I crrne back 1 was quite a ho more success»

"Over the last three years, I’ve
watched friendships develop
between college students and
local people that I think are as
valuable as any money that I
could ever make. ”

have been, bur like 1 said. no regrers And in soil married ro rhe
same woman."Wl-1en he finally ﬁnished his degree, he was ac.
corded some unomeial recognirion, Phelps said. “1 rhink 1 had rhe
disrincrion orgraduaring wirh rhe lowesr GPA in ihr hisrory ofrhe
doparrmenr."

Even when he rerurned ro Grinnoll, Phelps didnr plan on any
ing after graduation. “when we moved ro the Sr. Charles area, 1
really wanred ro move ro a big city," he said. “1r didn’t rake long ro
realize rhar you can rake rhe boy our ordie eounrry, bur you can'r
rake rhe counrry our ofdie boy."

so rhe boy stayed in rhr eounrry. working as a road builder,
a welder, a counselor and reacher wirh disabled adulis, a rruek
driver, a planr breeder. a welder again, rhc owner ora wine and
liquorsrore and now, ﬁnally, rhe proprieror ofSaint's Rest. “It’s
amazing whrr rhar Grinnell degree will prepare you for," he
said.

In rhs end, he was glad he you never quire gor around ro leavV
ing Grinnell. “I dearly love Grinncll,"
Phelps said. “Ir's a grear communiry and
rho rolicge helps make ir so," It’s nlso, he
said, ”a grsar place ro raise kids, Borh of
my children have hrnehred from being
here."

Phelpx' older drughrer, Margarer, is
a band dirceror and his younger daugh—
rer, Hannah Phelps ’04, is a rheirer ma.

ofAndrcw, Margarer's son. Plioios ofAn-

Jeff Phelps’
career advice

- ”Success is something that
you measure by whether
or not you’re able to do
the things you want to do
during the day and then
can go home with a smile
on your face.”

' "If Grinnell teaches you
anything, even ifyou're a
lousy student, it teaches
you to rhink on your
feet.”

~ ”The first thing I did right
after graduation [was to]
work as a roadhuilder . . .
Probably rhe best

. preparation 1 ever had
from Grinnell was learning
how to shovel 13.3. ihoni
could shovel asphalt off
the back or the truck."

O ”Grinnell really didn't do a
very good job of preparing
me for the bureaucracy
you have to deal with."
However, Jeff admits he’s
"never really dealt very
well with bureaucracy."

- One of the biggest osseis
for Grinnell students is
the ”versatility of the
education. The degree is .
just a' piece of paper, but
Just the on that you
have to learn how to
think is probably the most
valuable that i tank from
Grinnell. That and the
socialization, renainly."
"The value or that Grinnell
degree throughout the
11.5., lhmughout the
world is not to be
underestimated. No
matter where you go, you
find Grinnell graduates.
Vou ﬁnd Grinnell
graduates doing lhlngs
that are way bill of their
fields. In a lot of cases it’s
because people who go
here are respected. it may
not seem like ll; you may
not understand why that’s
so at this point in your
lives, but it opens a lot of
doors.”

'Never give up. You roo
could run a coffeehouse
someday,"
