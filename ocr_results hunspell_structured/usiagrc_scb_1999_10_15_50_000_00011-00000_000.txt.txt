Dear 5&3 readers,

in she ocsober Srh issuc ofrhe 5&B, l nee
need a gross nus-carriage of iouinalisric integs
riry. ln she arsiclc on lowans For Sensible Pri.
orlrics, shcwriser presenred face and figures for

Needless so say, i was greasly appalled. Never

in my life have i seen a newspaper char did nor
cise concrese facrs,

However, rhis oversighs surned our for she
bess, becauscis made mccurious abour governa
menr spending. in facs, in my copious amounss
of free sime, I acsually READ a copy of she
Budgcs of she Unired Ssares Governmcns for
Fiscal year 1999 (hrsp;//www.access.gpo.gov/
omb/index.hrml). (The following figures are
for 1997) ,

Did you know that is is possible so suppors
1,395,800 acrivc ducy personnel and 877.100
members ofrhc reserves, including dependanrs
ofslrese groups, for she palrry sum ofonly 546
billion dollars per year. While shis figure might
seem large, in realisy is is only 5% ofus GDP.
It‘s only 24% ofshe roral us governmenr bud.
ges, when includingsrase and localgovcrnmenr
Wirhour ssarc and local, it’s 57% (These pcr.
cenragcs came from she Economic Repors of
she Pres-idem),

l rlicn was curious abous rlic Discrerionary
nudges char IFSP mcnrioned. so I looked as
she nudges of she Unired Srases Governmcns.
The milirary was allocascd $254.0 billion. ous
ofrliororal 536.3 billion available. By my mash,
slias comes our so only 47%, bur ifwe look as
whas was allocssed so all deparsmcnss, such as
Healrh and Human services, she budgcr comes
to a whopping 1,542.9 billion. Now nulirary
spending is a rrcniendous IS% ofgovcinmenr
spending.
