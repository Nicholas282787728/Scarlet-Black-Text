The art of community
learning through EXCO

By ANTHONY SCOTTO
& DAVID GROPPE

' Features Writers

From our years of experience at Grinnell,
we have found that some of the deepest and
most profound learning results from the in,
teractions we have had with our peers.
These interactions, both in passing converr
sation and in extended discussion, have re
vealed not only an interest in various
courses of study at Grinnell, but more sign
niﬁeantly, an engaging interest in a variety
of other subjects, from the mundane to the
exotic. While the classroom environment
has proven and continues to prove inspir-
ing, we have come to realize that our inter-
actions with other students, professors and
townsfolk are more moving and ultimately
more signiﬁcant in our personal growth and
learning.

Thus, in the following article, we intend
to introduce the community to the concept
of the Experimental College (hereafter,
EXCO). Essentially, EXCO is a commu-
nity effort in which students, professors and
townsfolk are invited to teach one-credit
(special topic) courses on campus. The
courses, proposed by those who demon-
strate expertise, enthusiasm and commit-
ment, would be approved by a central com-
mittee of student organizers, and then of-
fered to the entire community once or twice
a week. Those students who teach classes
as well as enroll in them would receive
credit.

This concept of EXCO exists at various
colleges throughout the country; one salient
and successful example is the program that
has existed since 1968 at Oberlin College.
According to their literature, the student-
run EXCO at Oberlin “provides the Oberlin
community with perhaps the most enjoy»
able and most rewarding experience in col-
lege leaming." In essence, the program at
Oberlin is as we described EXCO above: a

community effort, offering credit to both stu-
dent and teacher, which is organized and
managed entirely by students.

The Oberlin literature states that in 1992,
a peak year for the program, over 1000 mem-
bers of the community were enrolled in 91
different classes with such titles as these:
“The Art ofBicycle Repair," “Palestinian Lit-
erature Since 1948," “The Films of Martin
Scorsese," “Learning to Salsa,“ “Beginning
Sign Language," “Music and History of the
Beatles," “Practicum at a Battered Women‘s
Shelter” and “South Asian Cooking."

As far as credits are concerned, the
Oberlin committee sets up the following pro-
vision: “each student may accumulate up to
ﬁve of the 112 credit hours needed for gradu-
ation through EXCO, and, of course, can take
any EXCO course for no credit at all." Thus.
one can see that EXCO complements rather
than substitutes for academic credit, and ap-
pears in a similar light to our current physi-,
cal education program, performance, music
offerings, last semester’s interim session and
other special one or two credit courses.

As illustrated, the notion of EXCO is not
foreign to Grinnell, nor is it potentially haz-
ardous to the current state of affairs. Rather,
EXCO provides both the forum and the in»
centive (credits) for students, as well as pro-
fessors and townsfolk, to enlighten the com-
munity with their knowledge of subjects that
are either too specialized or too nontradi-
tional to be offered under the current sys-
tem. In addition, such an option offers Stu»
dents a chance to develop a more profound
sense of responsibility and commitment to
conununal effort and exchange.

Since this article is a mere introduction to
the concept of EXCO, we welcome any ques-
tions or comments (as well as names of those
interested in helping us promote EXCO)
from faculty and students (please vax
[Sisyphus]), and we hope that through in-
creased awareness and community interest.
we can take the necessary steps to develop
this program at Grinnell.
