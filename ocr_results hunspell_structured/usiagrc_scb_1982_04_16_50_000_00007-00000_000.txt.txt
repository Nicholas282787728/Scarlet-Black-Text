the upswing this year. The Grinnell Grit
fins Rugby Club defeated a combined Mare
shalltown/Newton team last Sunday by a
score oi 25712 in front of an unusually large
crowd. The team now has a 1»1 record for
the season.

Grinnell took the early lead with a three-
point field goal by Pete St Thomas. Grin-
nell continued to dominate the score
throughout the game. Josh Farley came
up with a powerful 30-yard solo run for a

by some fine individual performances.
though it lacked teamwork.

The second half proved to be the better
halt in spite of the nine points given up ear~
ly in die half. By the end of the second half
Grinnell pulled together in a fine show of
teamwork to score two trys within minutes
of each other. Scott Golstein had an ex-
cellent game and scored three of the five
Grinnell trys. Gene Anderson made
another try wiui a live-yard power drive
off the side of the scrum.

Last week’s snow presented a problem
for the club by cutting into much needed
practice time. The club was forced to
move into the PEC to teach me game to
new players and get conditioned for the
busy season ahead. The snow did not stop

Players worked until four in the afternoon

The club shows a lot of potential this
season. There are more players this
season than ever before and close to 30
players report consistently to practices,

Inclement weather forces teams into compact seasons

by Jeff Raymond

Snow has played havoc with the
schedules of all or the spring sports teams
so far. The golf team is one week behind
and probably won't be able to make up the
matches it has missed. The men's tennis
team has cancelled one meet and postpon-
ed another and the track team has
postponed a meet that it missed. The

baseball team will try to make up three
games that it missed but will not have time
to make up any games mey may miss in
the future. The softball team has also been
snowed out of some Contests. Men's Tennis
Team Coach and Athletic Director John
Pfitsch summed up the schedule situation
by saying. “The whole season is slowed up

High School diamonds.

Grinnell opened its season Monday,
April 12. dropping 6-2 and liaﬂ contests at
Coe. Four games scheduled earlier this
month were weathered out. Coach Ed
Dombrowski expressed satisfaction with
the play of his Pioneers. who have been
forced to practice indoors because of the
weather. ”Our lielding was quite good," he
said and lauded Kathy Cullen and Lisa In-
genito for “some outstanding plays.” He
continued. “I'm confident our pitching and
hitting will come along when we are able to
practice outdoors regularly."

Baseball

The Grinnell baseball team kicked off its
1932 season Wednesday at the North Field
Diamond. The Pioneers swept a
doubleheader from the Cornell College
Rams 771 and 3-1. Coach John Martinek
was pleased with his team's early season
performance. “We made a lot of good air
iensive plays and played pretty solid
defense. We didn't make many errors."'
Dave Smiley and Matt Rueft both pitched
well in their regular season debuts.

Three previous games were postponed
and will be made up on Sundays
throughout the season. Should there be any
future cancellations this season, the
games will not be made up.

pretty much.“ He called this the worst
season for weather since 1973.

Pfitsch noted that practice time is also
considerably reduced because of the bad
weather and the sport‘s seasons could last
{or only about one month. He proposed
moving the softball team into an NCAA7
Aligned league as opposed to the AIAW
because of a more efficient tournament
structure that would leave the team more
time for games. This move would be com-
plex and political, however. and will not be

instituted until next year. /

Baseball Coach John Martinek has sug
gested moving the baseball season to the
fall but the idea does not hold well
with other coaches around the league
Even though more games could be played
in better weather, the conflict with football
would be too great in both time and
players. Some schools are playing selected
”spring sports" in the fall but it is unlikely
that baseball will also be a fall activity in
the near future.
