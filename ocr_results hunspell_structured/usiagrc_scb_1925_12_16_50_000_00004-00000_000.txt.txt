that played havoc with the 0911057
ition‘s defense. He was second high

that he was guarded closely after his
first per-romance. He made one more
basket that the high scorer Larson
but did not get many tries from ~the
foul line. Larson, former Osage high-

school star, shelved that he can still-

use his size, weight and, speed to good
advantage and was unquestionably
one of the better players in the tourn-
ament.

At center, Morgan Taylor did not
find a par. The rangy World's chamr
pion used his speed to good advant-
age and played a good floor game. He
also possessed a fair eye for the loop
as he was third high scorer, hlt~
ting the loop nine times in three
games.

The freshmen guards Coggeshall
and thil were two of the outsanding
players or the tournament. Their
scrappy play held the opposition to
a low figure in every game.
Coggeshall also contributed 'sevei-al
baskets to his team’s cause.

The second team possessed some
good players but it is decidedly in—
ferior to the first rive. Doll Duke.
frosh forward who ra'nlred fourth .in
points scored; is given a berth along
with Culver ,the only junior to get on
either five.

John Spencer, ,husky sophomore
center showed up to a gofod advantage
and was awarded the pivot. position
on the second five. He lacked the
agility of Taylor, however.

Two other sophomores, Canady and

sophomores had a strong team and it
was not until the second half or the
liner game with the freshmen that
they were put out of the running.'1t
was the splendid work of the guards
Canndy and Locke that was responr
sihle for this showing of the second
year men.

Other good men who were left off
the honorary teams were Rinefol‘t,
Patton and Schroer. Rinefort, husky
junior, had he played in all of the
games would probably have made one
of the two mythical fives. Patton,

another Junior and Scllroer of the
yerrliugs were good men who played
if strong part in their teams oftens—

“My own conclusion," stated Dewey,
"was this; there are many valid one
iections to the court; but since, as Mr.
Darrow says, we have not a single
friend among the nations or the world,
we cannot afiord to throw away this,
our last chance to redeem our-
selves in the ‘oyes of the wurld'. If
the court has fztlllts, we can correct
them better as a member nation than
we can as one who persists in make
his destructive criticisms."
