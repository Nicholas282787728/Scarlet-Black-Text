O The New Constitution

Next Monday the new constitution of the
Student Council is going to be presented in
student chapel.

Until the new constitution has been put
into actual use, it is of course impossible to
say whether it is better than many fore-
going constitutions or not. But if the plan
as it appears on paper is any indication of
its practical worthrand it undoubtedly is
some indication—the new Student Council
should be highly successful.

Generally speaking, the new constitution
incorporates the fundamental principle of
initiative ”originating in the student society
as a whole and not in the minds of a small
group of leaders. It also recognizes and in-
corporates the principle that there can be no
interest and responsibility taken by the stu-
dents Without some formal medium through
which that interest and responsibility can
be expressed

Specifically, under the new constitution
there will be a larger and more representas
tive Student Council. There should he ample
opportunity for students with ideas and
suggestions to express themselves and see
those suggestions put into practice. On the
other hand there should be no loss in effiv
ciency, because all the detailed work of ad»
ministration will be handled by a small Cens
tral Committee. Thus the new constitution
should provide for all the advantages of a
large legislative body (the Student Council
as a whole) and also for all the advantages
of a small efficient executive body (the Cen-
tral Committee).

Quite obviously, with such a method of
drawing from the ideas and proposals of the
student body the work of the student repre—
sentatives aiid leaders should be much more
meaningful and effective. Because of the
larger structure of the council and the sep»
aration of legislative and executive powers,
the student leaders should not only have
more specific duties and more time to per-
form those duties, but they will be more
accountable to the constituencies (halls and
cottages) they represent.

The only way in which this new council
can be effective is through the active inter
est of every student on the campus. And it
appears that the new organization should
provide the opportunity for any student to
do something about his opinions and come
plaints concerning the school. If we all ac—
cept this privilege for what it is worth, the
new council should be a success and the
spirit and the general attitude of the stil-
dent body improved.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

0 A Commendable Change

(Ropiinteil from the Council Bluffs Nim-
pdi'eil) .

We note with interest that Grinneil College is about
to abolish its department oi Journalism We ap-
prove heartily.

or all the impractical and unnecessary depaic-
menis maintained by universities and colleges, jcu -
nallsm departments are the most useless.

This is not the worst of ic. Practically cvcry
school of journalism is a fraud. The journalism
schools encourage young men and women to he—
have that their Services Will be in demand after
they graduate.

There was a time when this was measurably
true. It isn't now.

so many newspapers have gone out of existence
in the last ten years dist newspaper jobs are
scarcer than they have been in the past. Nor is
there any prospect of a greater demand in the fu—
ture. Quite the oonLrary. Practically no new news-
papers are being starLed and some that are still
struggling along are certain to disappear.

Tho Noiiparcll receives scores or applications
from hopciul journalism graduates cicry spring.
So does every other neu-spnpoi- in the country. Most
of these bright, young people apply in until. The
number or uv labia jobs is only a irnctimi oi the
number applying.

Furthermore the nvcrugc editor is disillusioned
with gradiuwcs of journalism schools, They dime
a sinnmring of newspaper lore and a upei-i'cui
knowledge at writing iid proof-reading. )1 .c oi
them haired little else. They would have been iar
better off if thy liiid concchtmul on English his-
tory, economics, and miniiiurizcd themselves on
what it going on in rho world of politics, business,
nnd other activities of gciicmi interest.

Griiinell proposes to adjust the department oi
journalism iinto die department or English. "his is
jusc what ought to be done by cvery college in the
comm-y.

Colleges would ssvc money by such an arrange-
ment and their graduates would meet with fewer
disappointments, because they would be equippd
to render services in many fields.

Giinnell college also plans consolidation and
simplification of other courses. “Required courses"
will no longer in included in the curriculum but
each student Will be required to take a qualifying
examination to test the general knowledge or libs
oral arts subjects at the end of his sophomore year.

It might be a good thing for members of the
state board of education to look into What is being
done at Gi-iiinell. They might discover how to save
the state some money and at the same time pro~
yidc better educational facilities at the state uni-
vei-sity and at the state colleges

s- :r » i

In the main, we inclined to agree with the
opinions of the Nonpareil on this subject.
However, We take exception to the state-
ment that “Practically every school of jour—
nalism is a fraud.” No legitimate school or
department of journalism has ever gun in-
teed any graduate a job. On the con dry,
they inf ‘m students of the path of briais
that confronts any person going into jour-
nalism.

It becomes increasingly clear though, that
a few journalism courses will have a definite
role in a liberal arts curriculum, for a cers
tain amount of journalism training will
show the student how the nonsprofessioual
courses fit into active use on the outside
\VOl'ld.

The good journalist today needs a strong
English background with the ability to write
well. Give the student a general journalism
course and let that be a guiding light in the
flirther study of history, economics, political
science, psychology, and philosophy. Then
he will be better fitted for a more technical
and thorough-going study of journalism in
graduate school.

To the Editor:

Con5ldel'ing the quantity and
quality of “form” displayed dur-
ing the half of the basketball
game last night, I have formed
the definite opinion (with others)

that badminton is one game in
which Grinnell women for excel
any performance which men
might put on.

With so called agile chgcrs fall-
ing to the floor like a barge-load
of pigiron, ilic grucciui spills of
die co-cd badminton players were
a revealing contrast. They bounc<
rd buck trim the pine boards
like a pm orig ball in u YMCA
championship match.

There is no Grilinell athlete
who, in my opinion, can match

the rcaction speed and the grace
of these women badminton ploy-
crs. Cored aililetcs may take a
back seat in other sport fields,
but the badminton "bird" goes to
the men.

Quad Smoker
Plans Stymied

Arrangements which provide tor
the installation of smoking rooms
in each cottage have not yet been
completed, according to Jane oi}
plerud, league board picsidcnt.

The rooms were to have been
installed ovcr the Christmas vaca-
tlon, but dimculues arose in de-
telminlng where the rooms should
be located. The new rooms will
be selected and ready for use,
however, sometime during the
curly part of the second semesA
ter, Miss Goplcrud said.

Second Semester
Flying to Begin
As Scheduled

Students wishing to take ilying
next semester are asked to file
application by Jan. 15, Grant 0.

Gale said that 14 applications
are already on file, and that the
quota for the college is 20. Class-
es, including navigation, meteor-
ology, and ﬂight rules and regur
altions, will begin on Feb. 1 or
immediately thereafter. _

get a job in ‘his specialized field?
He has nothing else to turn to."

William Coleman, senior: "I
don't like the plan because of the
scrapping of the business admin-
istration major. Almost 50% or
the men students in the past have
majored in this field "

nnmild Vance, senior: “My only
regret concerning the curriculum
changes is that I will not be able
to enter as a freshman next
year. i do hope, however, that our
intercollegiate athletics will not
suffer.”

Phyllis Hoimhnii. sophomore:
"Without a doubt Grinnell college
Will be a miniature UniverSIty of
Chicago in a few year —-a splen—
did institution for the intelligent—
518, a school of which to be proud
Right now it's a sad, bewildering
turmml of changing plans.”

Lois \Vliilchend, sophomore: “I
don’t like the plan. If a student
has had, for example, a couple of
years of a language in high
school. and has to wait until the
end of his sophomore year to take
the exams which will take the
place of distribution requirements,
he will be at a disadvantage, If
he hasn‘t had a course in it dur-
ing college, he is very likely to
be quite rusty."

Robert Young, sonior: “The
new curriculum will undoubtedly
take three 01‘ four years to de~
Velop into _ a really efficient
process; however, in my opinion,
it will off-er lbe student a. much
better liberal arts education, I
particularly like the shift of em-
phasls from required courses to d
Ilse of the courses as tools for
getting information which will
permit the student to continue in
the upper school, or junior or se-
nior your,"
