The Day at Prayer just passed

because of the two addresses de-
livered by Prof. Graham Taylor,
which, tor power and earnestness.
have rarely, if ever, been equaled

in the morning, Prof. Taylor-
spoke in the chapel in thestttdents
especially. taking tor his text the
wordsof Paul,“]n Christ allThings

are Become New," He said in
part: “Paul, after his conversion,
was a new man, because he was
inspired by the spirit of Christ.
This inspiration was not mere
dogmatic beliet, but a broadening
of vision, which led him to look
at things as Christ would have
done. in other words, he adopted
the Christian point of view, as ex.
pressed in tire tvords otthe text.

Man has always telt an absolute
intellectual necessity of obtaining
a' true View of the universe, As
the knightsot Klng Arthui‘scauit
went out in search of the mystic
contents of the Holy Grail, so all
the pageantry of history has gone
forth to seek the ttnitics of lilc.
The great world empires have
sought the unities oi government.
and in a precisely similar way the
emperors of thought have tried to
discover the untties of thought,
and to bind together the world of
things in one systematic system of
philosophy, But the search for
unity in the realms ot government
and philosohy has failed, because
it strove after uniformity rather
than unity,

Unity iii spiritual things has also

 

been a subject ot search Li e
the coitccption of the Holy Ro-
man Empire, which was intended
to unilC all nations under one spire
itttal licad, we have the thought of
Christ. the expression of the relar
tionship between God and man,
Man is to View all things in the
light of God, and this is the Chris
tian point of view, from which we
are to look ottt upon the world and
see our relation to the walldrlife.
The uniﬁcation of Christianity is
found in the conception that God
is in Christ, in the coordination of
the designing: God. the creation of
the universe, with ChristI which
binds nature and man together in
one great system of unity? Chris
tian laith " the adoption of this
point of view of the relation of all
things to God, not blindly, but
tentatively, and testing it for our
selves.

But we have also the problem
of our relation to others. The
question is not of the relation of
God and one particular soul, but
of one particular soul to God and
to all other souls. C' ist is not a
rtiere ecclesiastical ﬁgure. but a
living terce, who has moved out
ot philosophy into practice, out of
eternity into time and otit of sect
itito all human experience. Men
are apt to become what we think
they are, theretore we should see
in all the Christian possibilities
which are there.

Moreover, he who has the Chris-
tian point of view will have a new
insight itito himself. He will have
a new view of Christian relation
ship which will give his lite a grant
and usetul purpose, Arnold Toyn-
bee say ‘Languor is dissipated
by enthuiasrn, and enthusiasm is
kindled by two thtnqs: An ideal
whtch carries everything by storm
and a purpose capable of putting
that ideal itito execution.’ Here
then. to answer these two r-eqirirer
merits, we have the Christian ideal
and the Christian purpose which
into the \vot‘ldrlife and
strives to reconcile it with God
and to bring it into tune with the
great laws of the universe.

enters

This is the everrprescnt oppor-
tunity of God, to bring in the
Christian brotherhood
each soul stands for all and all for
each, to be ambassadors of Christ
tolead the worldtor-ighteousness.”

The preliminary contest for
choosing the speakers to represent
the society in the inter-society der
bate with the Plrilomatliian society
of the State University, took the
place of the regular program at
last Saturday's meeting. The de-
bate was the best which has taken
place in the society this year.
Those who took part had worked
hard since the ﬁrst preliminary
contest, which took place three
weeks ago, and the result was that
the society listened to a well pre-
pared debate. All the points of
the question, with but tew excep-
tions. were well covered. At no
time did the interest lag. The
speakers were interested tti their
question, and they threwa spirit
into the debate, which, despitethe
