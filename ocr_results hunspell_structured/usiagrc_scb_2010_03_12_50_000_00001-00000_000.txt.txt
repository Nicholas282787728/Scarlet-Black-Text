Osgood, pleased
with results of
campus plan

Bv CARLOS Rr LU

President Russell K Osgood said he is pleased
with the results ofthe campus plan conceived 12
years ago, a plan that called for a variety or aes-
thetic and institutional updates to the College.
Among the changes were additional dormitories,
a new campus center and improvements to the
college's athletic facilities. He is also optimistic for
the completion of future projects, such as making
the campus more diﬁerentlyvabled accessible and
thc integration of"greener" facilities.

“I mink we have come from a situation when
our facilities were sound but out of date. and too
small for our student body‘ Osgood said “And
now it's a situation where the facilities are lovely I
think its been a great success."

In the spring of1998—a few months before
Osgood took oiiice that July~head oiiicials orthe
college hired the architectural planning arm Sher
pley Biilfinch Richardson and Abbott to evaluate
the condition and placement orvarious campus far

”To many students, we really weren't sure
whether it would happen or how.” Flammer

for the better.”

Most of the plans original objectives have
been completed. much to the satisfaction of the
administration and to Osgood.

“As each capital project evolved. a budget
was thoughtailly developed given the needs and
resources of the college, wrote Karen Voss, the
Vice President for Finance and Associate Treat
surer for the college, in an email. “The aggregate
total of these projects have been completed under
budget."

According to Voss, the completion orthe cam-
pus plan has increased the total square reet count
of campus buildings by more than 45 percent.

“Over the course otrhe 12 years now, essene
rially we have done it all, with the exception that
we did not build a new library yet Osgood said.

Originally, the campus plan called for anew
library to be built in the middle of campus, next
to the current location of the JRC. However, the
architects eventually agreed that the space was
not large cnougli to accommodate both facilities.

Community members discuss' Issues of race on campus

’Do We Still Need to Talk About Race?’ forum held as follow up to bias- motivated incident

Ev}. FRANCIS Bust:

For some, the response to the bias-motivated
vandalism of Graciela Guzman’s ’11 campaign
posters (see p. 1, March 5, 2010 stair) began and
ended with the opening of the allecampus email
notifying students, raculty and staff or the men
dent. For many more, the effects of the incident
continue today

Atari all Campusforum spearheadedby Pos—
se, Student Organization for Latino/as (SOL),
AJust and other groups, at least 360 students,
faculty, staff and community members spent over
two hours conversing about issues of race and
identity in regards to academic and social aspects
Grinnell's campus The title of the forum was
taken from Posse's choice for this year’s January

retreat in Des Moinesinamely, “Do we Still .

Need To Talk About Race?”

Despite the talks formal and academic intro—
duction to the term “wetbaclc” the speciﬁc term
used in the vandalism case, the student, staff and
facility perspectives created a fianle or as Our
man said,"real" tone.

_ "I think it worked outgreat to also show cam-
pus that therc have been a lot of conversations
that have gone out that have also been lucrative
and great that have come from a academic place,"
Guzman said. “But there’s another approach to
this that can be more teal sometimes. When
you're talking about all issues or isms—meism,
Classlsm‘SDmCElmBS you do need to start in a
real place to conrexruilize it for people."

Elena Bcrnal’94,Vicc President for Diversity
and Achievement, collaborated with SOL as well
several indmduils within the Posse community,
to create the forum In which members of the
Griiincll community to talk about the incident
and us ltiiplicatiotts tor student lire.

“We needed to have some basis in order to
communicate with everybody And also because

. the community wants to come together in times

of strife This' is about the best part of Grinnellians
coming together, Bernal said we need to have
a creative space tor that because otherwise folks
are all out there reacting and not having any abilr
iry to commune with each other at a time when
you just being in a safe space is important."

The forum used a conversation technique
known as “ﬁshbowl, inwhich a small group holds
a discussion, facing one another In a circle, tn the
middle of the larger audience The ﬁshbowl was
divided up into three diirercntsegmenis speaking
about how their identity effects their daily lives at
Grinnell4a Latino/a, white and faculty and staﬁ
spoke one at a time

”I heard ﬁshbowl style mentioned and I had
no idea what it was, though it sounded kind of
weird," said Ashur Bratt ’12, who spoke during a
ﬁshbowl conversation. “It provides this comfort‘
able space..,lt creates this comfortable style, but
knowing the greater space was a safe space it was
a great way to help people say what they acnially

think.”

The conversation that spning outorthe emoe
tive style or discussion helped. some students

dents,

bran publicly discussed feeling like he had
been “punched in the chest" after heating one
students experience during ﬁshbowl convere
sution, and felt is if he gained perspective how
identity factors into daily life.

“To hear other people, whatever the content,
to have people be willing to share things that
are that near and dear to their heart, that sacred,

is what truly made it a safe space ’Bratt said.
“That people are willing to share themselves with
you, so why not share yourselrwith them? And
when you share yourselfwith someone else, and
you're honest, that’s when you feel the best. I felt
die weight lifted OE my shoulders. because these
things occurred to me that hadn’t occurred to me."

open microphone time followed the ﬁsh
bowl, where members of the audience had access
to speak their mind, whether in direct response
to certain shared stories or with general thoughts.
Afterwards. students, faculty and staiir mingled
outside ofJ'RC 101, and tried to move the con-
versation to those who were not at the forum

“If this campus really stands to do any sort
of formative big change in how campus looks at
anything, and all of that needs to happen, that
can start from here," Guzman said, noting that
the collaborative effort of the forum

As a result of the College's developing hate
crime policy, an all-campus email was sent out
two weeks ago, after Guzman‘s poster was re
ported as wrndalized. some may have stopped
thinking about the incident soon after, but the
energy that ﬂowed from JRC 101’s doors and
into residence halls, the Dining Hall and town
will do anything but let the issue ofrace and idens
titystop there.
