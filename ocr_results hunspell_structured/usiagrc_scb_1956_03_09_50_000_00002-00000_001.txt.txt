his own death in the dorm of an elegant Princess, chauffeured
in a'Rolls—Royce by Hertebise, a student who Committed sui—
cide, and escorted by uniformed motorcyclists,

The Princess orders her aides to run down one of her proteges,
a drunken poet named Cegeste and bids Orpheus accompany her.
Inside the car with the dead Cegeste, Orpheus is entranced with
mysterious messages of poetic inspiration transmitted by short—-
waive radio from the Beyond. He is infatuated with the Princess
as he watches her reanimate the body of Cegeste and disappear
through a dissolving mirror representing the passageway between
life and the Underworldo

The Princess decides, without higher permission; on the death
of Eurydice and her cyclists perform their duty. Guided by Her—-
betise, Orpheus descends into the Underworld in Search of her»
Asked whether he wants Eurydice or the Prihcess, he answers,
"The two.“

They journey through a no—man‘s land of darkened ruins where
lost figures wandero Orpheus finds himself struggling against
invisible barriers, In a windowless room they find the Princess
on trial for exceeding her authority in killing Eurydics. She
confesses her love for Orpheus as her motive. The tribunal re—
stores Eurydice to life on the condition that Orpheus never
again look at her face.

An ironic scene follows in Which Orpheus is cruised while Eury—
dice cannot hear the'strain. Resolving to die; she forces Or—
pheus to hook at her, and is immediately reclaimed by Death. A
moment later Orpheus is beset by the Bacchantes, represented by
a band of envious poets who believe Orpheus responsible for the
disappearance of Cegeste. A struggle ensues and Orpheus is shot.
At once he is seized by the motorcyclists and carried off to
the Princessa

With but a few moments to act, the Princess renounces her love

by her own aides and led away to a higher, less lenient, tribunal.
