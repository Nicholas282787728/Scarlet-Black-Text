In an email to student staffon Thursday, March 19, Dean
of Students Travis Greene announced that Andrea Conner
had been appointed to the position ofAssistant Dean of stop
dents 84 Director of Residence Life and Orientation. After
rnterviews, job talks, artd rrrformal discussions wrth students
was chosen by a committee comprised of members from
SGA. SAs, RLCs, faculty and administration

Currently, Connor is the Assistant Dean of Students and
Director of Residence Life at Bard College. According to the
Bard website, her position includes over-seeing Area Coordis
nators (ACs) of the doll-as, comparable to RLCs, and Peer
Coordinators (PCs), who serve a function similar to SAs.

Conner, an lowa natrve and coe college graduate, is well
versed in not only all thrngs iowa, but also has been profess
sionally involved with small, liberal arts institutions like
G ell for some time,

From the minllte Andrea hit campus the feedback we
were getting, especially from students, was that Andrea
seemed like a fit for Grinnell,” said Vice President ofStudent
Affairs Houston Dougharry. “She has by far the most experi-
ence at small liberal arts colleges having gone to and worked
at three ACM [Associated Colleges of the Midwest] colleges
and then being at Bard [College], which is similar to Grinnell
in some ways.

Paul Gagne '11, a student-at-large on the hiring commits
tee, said Conner stood out above all the other candidates.

“She immediately understood not only the concept ofsclf
governance, brrt also what it means to this school," Gagne
said “Also, the fact that she is very approachable makes her a
desirable person to have as an administrator."

The position of Assrstant Dean involves the hiring, trarns
mg and supervision ofall RLCs.

Though Conner will not be present on Grinnell's campus

until May, she has already been involved with the search for
new RLcs. At a conference in Washington DC, t s past
weekend, she participated in interviewing RLC can rdates,
according to Dean ofstudents Travis Greene.

Candidates will be coming to campus beginning as early
as next week.

One ofthe biggest changes to the Assistant Dean position
will include Conner heading up the N50 committee Pre-
viously, several administrators were involved at the process,
often making it difﬁcult to have a cohesive and coordinated
strategy. “orientation has sort of ﬂoated, different people
have had responsibility for it at different times over the past
years and we’re really wanting it to have a home," Douglrarry
said.

Since N50 has been solidiﬁed in Student Affairs, some
of the initial diffcrences Will be infrastructural changes from
years past. “Instead ofhaving a student comnrrtree and then a
faculty/staff committee .. , we're bringing the whole group (0*
getlrer," Dougharty said. “In general, we're going try to make
it a more integrated program, and we’ll prrt in it Andrea's car
pabie hands when she gets here."

As part of Hugh Redford ’10‘s Wilson internship, he will
be spen ing his summer in Grinnell working with Conner on
2009's NSON‘NSO was broken before and it was impossible
to get things done and you never knew who you needed to
talk to," Redford said. "There's only good that will come out of
everybody having to spend less trnre frguring out who to ask
their question to and more time trying to find the answers."

“She [Conner] has the sort of background to be adminis-
tratrve and operate rn that kind ofway and environment but
also really get along wrrh students and really be comfortable
with being a student advocate," Redford said

Elected cabinet members have begun to review applications for cabinet seats an discuss their broad goals and plans

or}. FRANCIS Bust:

There are fewer than 50 days left until the end of the school
year, and the fumre members of next year's SGA cabinet have
begun to wet their feet in the often complex game of Grinnell
student governance

With the positions of President, Vice President of Student
Affairs and Vice President Academic Affairs filled by Harry
Krejsa '10, Ben Offenberg '11 and Joanna Demars 'io respev
rively in last month's election, and current Assistant Treasurer
Cyrus Witthaus'io in place to take on the position ofTreastirer,
next year's Cabinet has begun to sift through the applications
for the remaining sbt positions.

The remaining spots on cabinet arc Administrative Coordi-
nator (AC), Films Chair, Concerts Chair, Service Coordinator,
Assistant Treasurer, and All Campus Events Coordinator.

In a deparmrc from previous years’ processes, the position
of AC, who is responsible for drafting agendas for meetings,
serving on election board and other administrative duties, Will
be frlled before the other applications are looked atThis move
was made so that the AC would have a voice in the formation
of the cabinet it will oversee, Krejsa said.

In addition, those who apply for AC are often interested in
other, more speciﬁc cabinet positions, such as Films or Con-
certs. Under the new process, Krejsa said that the applicants
who are not nominated for AC will likely apply for other posi—
trons.

Krejsa said the decision for who will be Ac would likely be
made today, in order to fully involve the student in the cabinet
selection process, which will begin this Sunday.

“Previously people have wanted to apply for both Ac and
something else, because AC is a more overarching kind of job,

and the other Cabinet positions are a narrow kind of job,“l<re-
jsa said. “They might want to apply for that first, before they
apply for another, So we wanted to grvc tlrem that optron,"

While Cabinet positions are being filled, Krejsa said he is
thinking about a new technology position, which will cover are
eas regarding SGA‘s implementation and maintenance oftools
such as GoogleDocs and irrstinrring the organization's web-
site. Offenberg compared the position to the current role of
the SGA posterer, who receives an hourly compensation from
SGA but is not considered a full Cabinet member.

“We’ve been tossing around the idea ofa sort of‘SGA tech
advisor’ whose position in SGA would be like the Presiding
Ofﬁcer," Krejsa said, “They would have very distinct and nar
row duties, such as managing the website, helping us better use
PioneerWebiif you think it's confusing now, try running an
election through it—and things like that."

Beyond simply changing the process ofapplying to cabinet
and SGA positions, Krejsa and his team have already begun to
incorporate notions ofa government “philosophy"into discus-
sion of their future plans.

“The four of us and [Assistant Director of Residence Life,
Loosehead RLC and SGA Advisor] Kim HindssBrush locked
ourselves away in theJRC for seven or eight hours on the Tuess
day of the second week ofbreak and basically plotted out what
kind of Cabinet we wanted to have," Krejsa said.

Talk has largely centered around the idea ofstriking a bal-
ance between student perceptions of07-08’s former SGA Pres-
ident Megan Goerings ’08 cabinet and this year’s cabinet under
President Neo Morakc ’09.

The administrations of Goering and Morake have often
been contrasted insofar as their method of governance, and

have been referenced as aggressive and passive, respectively. In
an 8&5 article from January 23,2009, ForrnerLoosehead sen-
rrtor Phil Hagen '10 said, “a lot of people really didn’t like last
yearithey thought it was too aggressive and too contentious.
Tire cabinet came in saying they were going to be a different
SGA than last year."

The Cabinet-elect has talked to previous members stretcht
ing back to fotiner SGA President Chris Hall '07 in hopes of
assembling a cabinet ofsnrdents that have a balance ofexperi-
ence and an appropriate “demeanor,” according to Krejsa.

HindssBrush will also play an important role rn acclimate
mg the new Cabinet to then positionss“Shc's seen three Cabis
nets and has a pretty good rdea of what kind of approaches
have worked in the past and what kinds ofapproaches have not
worked in the past," Krejsa said.

The upcoming cabinet has said they have dedicated a large
amount oftrme to observing and rnteracting with current SGA
members and the administration in an attempt to minimize the
time it takes to adapt to SGA demands next year.

“l've been shadowing [current VPAA] Julie Hoye '09 all
year," Demars said. “So I am on all the committees that I’m 31*
lowed to be on With her, and I’ve scheduled private committee
meetings with her and some academic officials,"

The process of acclimating themselves for their duties as
cabinet members, coupled with siftrng through applications
and interviews from potential cabinet members, has been a big
ger time commitment than expected, Deinars said.

“I'm a little overwhelmed, I‘m going to be honest with you.
The interview process and the application process is a lot bigT
gerofa time commitment than I thought itwould be,"Demars
said. “But I’m not worried at all about next year."

“That night 1 was in Cleveland lounge till
about 10 pm. and I left my computer there,
as I usually do and then i left to go to Rose

Tire security officer that happened upon

increase in security patrols in Cleveland Hall.
According to Briscoe, the increased presence
of security in Cleveland is due to complaints
about cigarette smoking.

“We had been down there a number of
times before, but we've gotten complaints just
lately again in that particular area [Cleve-
land 1sr lounge]," Briscoe said. “And so we
started gorng to that area on a regular basis
and then when we saw what was gorng on, the

Cleveland hall resident Cecilia Darby '12
said that the security presence has stretched

beyond merely routine checks. “1 was woken

up at three in the morning by a security radio
orrtsrde my door because they saw my pet rats
and thought they were wild rats." Darby said
in a phone interview with tho 5&3. "Anyway,
it was just like a vcry strange invasion of our

smoking indoors and decrease the presence of
security in the dorm, “we're lroprng that the
