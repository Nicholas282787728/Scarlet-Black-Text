The Jagged Edge

by Julie Slivinsky

The tension in the 1935 film “The
Jagged Edge” is thick enough to be
cut with a knife — the jagged edge
of a serrated hunting knife, that is.
This film, starring Glenn Close and
Jeff Bridges. is a masterpiece in
intensity,

The plot centers around the
brutal murder of a wealthy San
Francisco woman who was hor~
ribly slashed with a hunting knite.
Jeit Bridges is the main suspect
and the husband of the victim. and
Glenn Close is his defense at-
torney, The tension oi deciding
whether Bridges actually
murdered his wife is compounded
when he and Close begin an affair.
The movie struggles with the
morality of the affair as well as
with Bridges’ honesty. It is ima
possible to guess it Bridges really
did it, although trying to answer
that question will keep you on the
edge of your seat,

Bridges does a good job playing
a character who is unpredictable.
His emotions are deeply hidden.

though he never quite seems at
ease. Every scene he is in is nerve-
wracking, even when the scene in
volves something as casual as
horseback riding. .

It is Close, however, who steals
the Show as the believable, likable,
and strong deiense attorney. Here,
at last, is a smart woman who is
also beautiful. She claims that she
believes in Bridges’ innocence, yet
she does not sound so sure. This
degree of doubt is also unsettling,
No one seems to be able to tell if
Bridges did it or not, including the
Viewer.

Supporting characters such as
Peter Coyote as the district at-
torney and Robert Loggia as a
down-to—earth private investigator
keep the film moving and help
break up some of the incredible
tension in every scene. “The Jagg»
ed Edge" is a mindatwisting iilm
not to be missed,

Brother From
Another T’lanet

by Andrew Hamilton

The topic is common enough: an
escaped slave iieeing irom his two
wouidabe captors, But “Brother
From Another Planet" is far from
being the screenplay to “Uncle
Tom’s Cabin.” Set in modern-day
New York City, the iilm accounts
the adventures of NeaToes, a
newlyaescaped cosmic slave irom
another planet His attempts to
outdo his pursuers and contact
previous escapees already hiding
in New York provide ample
material to involve the audience in
a him that is at once cnioyahle and
thematic. The film is not overhear
ingly moralistic, and the story
oiten hits amusing aspects. Yet
even when watching the antics oi
two white men lost in Harlem, the
audience never loses the general
ieeling oi displacement which
permeates the iilm.

”Brother From Another Planet"
gives us an interesting view oi
ourselves irom a new perspective.
Two-Toes encounters such
peculiar aspects oi America as the
monetary system, heroin, and the
interaction of blacks with whites,
with the rare naivete of an Inno-
cent.

The film is a clearasighted in»
trospection oi New York and. on a
more personal level, each one of
us, The picture is creatively iilmed
and Stocked with natural dialogue
which comes irom the characters,
not from a script. “Brother From
Another Planet" provides a
valuable new way at looking at
some old but, it is sad, not outdated
concerns oi humanity.

by Lisa Stuart, Kathryn Thurber,
and Cressa Jenkins

“Diva" is a retroactive French
expressionistic (similar to Ger-
man expressionistic) iilm that cap-
tures the essence ol the avant-
garde, pseudopretentious sub-
culture movement ot modern-day
Paris. From the opera to the
metro, our protagonist Jules leads
us through a cacophonic maze oi
seedy situations and satistyingl
suspense. Dospite the harrowing
fields of emotion and harsh
metropolitan imagery, Grin»
nellians might find themselves
swayed into a parapeted smte.

Jules' poignant obsession with
the dazzling Bella Donna (Diva)
provides the setting for a myriad oi
mysteries. The climatic half-hour
chase scene develops into a conius-
ing web of intrigue involving pro-
stitution rings, drug dealers, opera
boot-legs, and murder
something for everyonel

Imagine a stranger suddenly
deposited in the middle of New
York, He does not speak the
language, he is disoriented, and to
top it all AH, he is a ”Brother From
Another Planet,” “Brother” is a
very entertaining film about how
an outsider sees our world The
iilm is a comedy even while show
ing us the worst oi our culture. it
has been said that we laugh at
things because they are true. That
statement embodies the comedy in
this film. We are forced to laugh at
ourselves when we are shown the
absurdity oi our actions. ii this
seems too artsy, do not let that
scare you oii. This is a very good
film which will capture your ims
agination and your ieelings.

“Brother From Another Planet”
was released in L984 and stars Joe
Morton as the mute alien. l-lis per
formance is excellent, and he does
a wonderiul job oi communicating
to the other characters and to the
audience without the use of words.
The film was wonderfuuy directed
by John Sayles, who also cameos
as one of the men in black.
“Brother“ has many memorable
moments, especially the opening
scenes filmed at Ellis Island.
Although filmed in 1984. this film
touches on many issues, such as
drugdealing and racism, that are
prominent today,

I highly recommend this iilm. On
a scale irom 50 cents to 34,50, 1 rate
it $4
