newspaper. However, there are ground rules which must be
followed to ensure that letters are in the best interests of all

parties concerned.

We encourage letters and will print thctn intact as soon as
time and space permit. Letters in poor taste. judged to be
libelous or not following the guidelines will not be published.

Froese thanks Kent for

setting "shining example"

To the editon

I‘ve just spent a semester off-
campus and I am delightfully
pleased with the progress that
Grinnell has made during my
absence. Upon rettu-ning I turned
to the opinion page in my S and
B and read Mike Kent's eloquent
article on gun control. Mr. Kent.
I am proud of you. I feel that we
are very similar and it is rare that
our kind expresses opinion so
openly in such a community.
Yes, Mr. Kent, I too am an idiot.
I have felt insufﬁcient surrounded
by' the best and the brightest
students in the nation at Grinnell,
but you have overcome this fear

and feel free to voice your ideas
in the campus paper! Bravo! I
sincerely hope to see you at our
next moron support group meet-
ing, where we individually
discuss our intellectual
deficiencies. Our motto is: “To
be ignorant of one’s ignorance is
the malady of the ignorant.“ By
coming to grips with our
stupidity I feel there is nothing
we can accomplish. Thank you,
Mr. Kent. for setting such a
shining example for our kind.
'You are a true fool. God bless
you! Paul Froese

Reader calls Kent's column
on drugs "unrealistic"

To the editor:

I apologize for reaching back
to last semester to dredge up one
of Mike Kent's columns, but I
feel someone needs to point out
the flaws in his argument for
legalizing currently illegal drugs.

Mr. Kent says that he has no
problem with someone who goes
into their room. gets high, and
sleeps it off. I agree with that
libertarian philosophy;
unfortunately, it doesn't accord
with reality. Most of those who
get high donft do it quietly be—
hind a closed door; they sit out in
the hall with a stereo blaring
Jimi Hendrix and yell at each

other until they pass out or
stagger back to their rooms. I
don’t know about Mr. Kent, but I
don‘t appreciate that form of
entertainment, especially when I
am trying to study or sleep.

As for asking them to be
quiet. people high on drugs
(alcohol. marijuana, cocaine,
whatever) are deliberately trying
to lose control of themselves
(why is beyond me). They would
not be receptive to any restraints
on their actions. In his column.
Mr. Kent compares the risk of
using drugs to driving a car. The
analogy. however, is

inappropriate. While driving.
people do recognize constraints
(stop when the light is red, don’t
drive on the sidewalks, etc.) They
alternpt to maintain control of
their actions. The lack of control
that drugs induce increases the
risk, and that IS why they are il-
legal, and why alcohol should be
in that category as well.

And, Mr. Kent, if you think
I‘m ovcrreacting, I lived through
a nightmare similar to the one I
described for a year here. I hope
you never have to go through
that. Daniel Schwarz, ‘89

Against the Grain

Well, heck. I’ve covered a lot of
really controversial topics in this
column, but] don’t think I’ve ever
tackled onequitc as big as thequcs-
tion of whether or not God exists. I
was sitting in my room during win-
ter recess, thinking about the holi-
days and all, and decided to try and
figure out whether or
not I believed in God.
I‘m notaretigious per»
son. For a nonvreli-
gious person to try and support a
belief in a deity is no small task.
The way I decided to go after the
issuewastodebate myself onitand
so in thiscolumn I’llsharewith you
the arguments that I used.

The case against God is really
easy. One must only assert that we
are biological units that are in the
process of a lengthy evolutionary
cycle. Most science supports this.
The case for God, in my case. was
based mostly on elements of hu-
man nature thatcannotbeexplained
through science. The existence of
the conscience was one point in
particular that proved to be a great
logical stumbling block. There is
no biological nor logically based
psychological reason whyI should
dislike seeing it small furry animal
being tortured. Theoretically, as
far as human beings are biological
units who must kill to survive, I

Consider, why should love ex-
ist? Lust is certainly enough to in-
sure the perpetuation of the spe-
cies. It is not logical that one per
son should“love" anothernoreven
that a parent should “love" its off-
spring. I began using
psychology to deter-
mine a necessity for
“love." In sheer bmte
terms, one could look at love as
being self-serving. You “love"

sivencss. Humans have a need to
acquire. It makes them feel good

you really want to reduce love to

fluence on a person. if we are, in
fact, biological units. Thiscan'tbe
stated as a fact, however, and ex
ceptions could occur.

Next I considered the idea on
the other end of the scale. Why
should we view certain behaviors
as “bad”? When the 200 pound
bully picks on the 98 pound weakv
ling. we look down on the bully.
This could be due to a universtll
sense of right and wrong, or it
could just be an inﬂuence of soci-
ety. We have been socially pro
grammed to believe that such ac—
tions are wrong. There are some
societies that have existed that
wouldn’t consider such actions
wrong.

OK, what about those people
who work for good and do so an- '
onymously’! That was a real trick.
They aren’t receiving any external
beneﬁt from their action. only a
“good feeling" on the inside. What
causes the “good feeling“? You
can say that it’s more social pro- ,
gramming, but it starts to become
extremely intricate. Why should
