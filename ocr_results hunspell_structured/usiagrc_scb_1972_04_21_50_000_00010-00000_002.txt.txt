The Winding
Path Of

Legislative

Apportionment

by Greg Vranicar

The issue oi reippnriionnieiii has been
accurately characterized .15 n mutter about
which the public knows very little nnd cares
about even less and About which members of
the legislnture know i great deul and core
about more than anything else. The state at
Iowa has been ill the midst oi reapportion-
merit battles even since the enrly 1960‘s
when the us Supreme Cc-iit iii st made the
famous one mane—one vole iiiling In the
past month, the "tinal plin“ tor the legislnr
tive redpportionment ill the 1070's wns nnnr
ded down by the Iowa Supreme Court The
plan-blasted by some und hailed by others"
has had and will have illipOi'Ltnl eliecis on
both short and long-range politics in Iowa,
In the 1971 legislitivc year, me lou‘a House
and Senate approved I‘vapporllonmeut plans
ior both the Congi-cssioiia' uml Silite Legis»
lative districts, Tile Congressional iedis-
tricting, forced by the relative population
decrease Which eliminated one of lou‘a‘s
seven seats in the U. S. House, was con—
sidered a fair compromise by almost all
factions involved in Iowa politics and was
not challenged in the com

The recent historv oi Sldte legislniive ree
districting is more lnlt‘l‘esling and bizarre,
however. The low House consists 01 100
seats, the Senate 50, eiich Senate district
encompassing 2 house districts Redistrict-
ing a stite ligis tJt'o is voiv much like
building two pgsiu puzzles oi the state-7
one of 100 pieces dud due iii 50

There are severdl important rules to fol-
low when putting together tllis nliiSSlVe puz-
zle. First, each HOUSE rind edch Senate
oistriotmust be is .ieirly equal in popula—
tion as every other House or Senate district
according to iedernl one mum-one vote

principles. Secondly. the districts must be
reasonably compact and should not violate
in any drastic way traditional geographical
boundaries like county, township, and city
lines Drawing districts only to satisfy these
two criteria is no easy task

But add the fact that most members of Ihe
legislature want to do :is much as they can
to iilsure their own reelection (which is
absolutely on essential rule ofreapportlonv
ment by Ii legislature), and one can See that
the task oi pertectly constitutional renppol‘r
tionment by the legislature is nearly impOSr
sihle For to miike sure that he retdius his
job, a legislator mustprevent other incum—
bent legislators and important politicdl lea—
ders of both parties from being included in
his district, and he must make sure he is in
a district whose voters have traditionally
returned a vote invorable to his pni-ty‘s
candidates
Since all 150 legislators want to accomr
plish their individual lasks Lind, as It body.
have to .1ng9 on a slatowide plan, isenpe
portionment debates are usually healed and
lengthy. Tlle number oi "deals" made in the
process oi debate and the necessary deviation
from the population and compactness stan»
dards. usufilly result in the fact that nny rc-
disti-icting plan drawn by .1 state legislature
will be favorable to incumbents and probably
will be somewhat unconstitutional

It a plan allegedly violdting the standards
ior population equality dud compactness he»
comes in“, it can be challenged in the courts
and c2in be ruled unconstitutional, After a
plan is ruled unconstitutionnlﬁas several
plans have been in lowa in the past Iew years--
the problem becomes choosing the agency to
be in charge oi collecting the constitutional
deficiencies Since 1969, low has tried
several means to correct unconstitutional
reapporlionniont,

The 1969 legislature adopted a renpportiom
ment plan somewhat favorable to incumbent
legislators and (because there were more
Republican incumbents than Democratic)
somewhat favoring Republicans, In the spring
at 1970, this legislative reapportionment plan
was ruled unconstitutional by the Iowa Su-
preme Court iii a cdse brought by the Demo-
cratic Party. The ruling \t'lis handed down
before the 1970 census figures were avail-
able, however, and it was issued too close to
the 1970 primary elections to undertake ree
districting to correct the unconstitiitionalitv
immediately. Faced with these problems, the
Supreme Court simply ruled that the leglse
lziture elected in November l9'70 would be
required to redraw the districts using the
1970 census data and would have to aim for

 

a much smaller population deviation (more
one mun-one vote) tiii’in it had achieved in the
LUBE] plan

Although the Court established the precedent
oi overruling the legislature's plan by its
1970 ruling, the "remedy” the Court proposed
was unworkable and [tilled to undo the uncon-
stltutlondl aspects oi the 1969 i‘eapportlonr
nicnt plan in Ct seemingly illconsistent direc-
tive, the Court told the 1971 legislature, it—
scll elected under in npportionment plnn de—
clcired unconstitutional by the court, to redraw
the lilies for the new districts Thus in the
1971 legislative session, lowa‘s new districts
were drawn by all uncoustituiionally elected
legislature. The plan this "unconstitutional
legislature dreu was even more lavorable-
to incumbents (mostly Republicans) than the
1969 plan had been, When it was challenged
late last year, the pldn was declared uncon-r
stitlillondl by the lawn Supreme Court

reeling that the legislature wds incompetent
and/or unwilling to draw a new constitutional
plan, the Court deemed late last Winter to
redraw the new lilies itself. The plrin unveiled
on April 1 was the court-drawn plzin. Only in
the past couple of weeks have lowans been
able carefully to assess the characteristics
oi the newest plan and make judgements on
its ramifications

Three main chnmcteristics distinguish the
court's plan, First, population equality and
compactness standards have been fulfilled in
o wny never beiore seen in Iowa and possibly
unprecedented iii the country, The deviation
between the largest Lind smallest dis lCtS
is smaller than ever before possible when
the “deals" in the legislature dictated ilhe
shape and Size oi districts.

Secondly, the court-dipwn plan ignored {or
the most part the city and county geographie
cal divisions, which have traditionally DEED
buildingrblocks for the jigsaw puzzle The
plzin created Iiitlny more districts that ills
clude both urban nnd rural populations ine
stead of one or the other. It also created
districts that include parts of several coun-
ties nnd tliils will affect the countyrbiised
organs of both the Republican and the DemoV
cratic parties in the stdte

Finally, the new plan gave absolutely no
favoritism to incumbents The plan was
seemiliglv drtiu‘li iiitlmut regard for who was
in the House And Senate and where they lived
There are 51 new House districts (out of 100)
which have within their boundaries no in-
cumbent legislators. This fact means that
there will be .’i good number of new [3365 in
the loud [louse elected next fall -» the turn,
OVL‘r betueeil the 1971 and 1972 legislitures

Almost everyone concedes that the new plnn
issued bv the Court will have some effect
on the upcoming election During this month,

It has boon generally conceded that the
Republican party had the most to lose by the
new plan. to! out of the 150 Sedts in the

extensively to research the court case against
the legislature's plan, said in an stirs interv
view that he guessed the plan produced a very
large number oi swing districts which could
go either way in an election depending on the
political year and the individual cnndidotos.

Rick Seagmve, chairman bi Story County's
Democratic party, was much more force-tut
in his comments. Seagrnve termed the court
plan “the greatest advance in government in
Iowa in the last few decades “ lie thinks
this because the plan destroyed the concept
of rural-only or urban—only districts and
because the plan assuies that many incumr
hent‘s will not return to the legislature next
session. When pressed to guess how many
seats each party could expect to win, he said

Iowa
Legislature

Is Not
A Joke

by John Morrissey

Iown politics, despite its relative simplicity,

remains a source oi bewilderment lo the
typical Grinnell student. Many students come
not identiiy with farm politics, and are given
to cracking yokes about the high priority oi
farmerelated matters. The front-page banner
headlines in the “Des Moines Register"
relating to a drop in hog prices or the price
commission's stand on iixed price ceilings
inevitably tickle the iunnybone otcrinnell‘s
city iolk, although such reports are oi great
concern to native Iowans.

What students fail, or refuse, to realize
is that inrming directly or indirectlyaccounts
tor 80% oi Iowa's economy. It is the ion, the
life's work, or a large segment oi the state's
people. A drop in market prices can be come
pared to a cut in an executive's salary, a
drop in a lawyer‘s business, or a wage dock
in a worker's weekly pay check

It is no wonder, then, that iarm matters
occupy so much ot the energy oi the news
media and the ouicials oi state government.
That is why iull days are spent in the Iowa
legislature debating such matters as sure
