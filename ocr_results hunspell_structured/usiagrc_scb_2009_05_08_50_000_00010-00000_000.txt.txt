some Grinncll students will be clawing for a spot
in a system ofranlsings that determine who’s in the best
singlcs and donhles. But they’re not breaking the sanc»
tiry ottoorn draw-it's the men’s tennis NCAA regional
tournament.

This weekend, the men‘s tennis team will play lltlr
ranked DcPauw University in the second round
oFthc NCAA regional match in St. Louis.
Thc Pioneers (18-9) are the third seed
in the region.

“DcFauw is a great team but I
certainly think we have the talent
on out team to beat anyone in the
country," Dan Laroantaine '09
said. “We’ve been here is the big-
gtst difference. We know what
to expect. we've played on these
courts, and we know what the envi-
ronment ofplaying in national tour. .

“I felt cheated," said Foa. “That doesn’t happen in
anything besides Dill sports. Last year’s fiasco lit a
are under us. We’ve played a real tough schedule, the
toughest schedule Giiniicll has ever playedThc key is
to go and nor he tight. We got to play loose and play
the tennis we know how to play."

That’s how Gnnnell played in their conference

tournament last weekendThe Pioneers swept
the singles championships and won two or
the three doubles championships.
“I didn't make a big deal about it
to the gays,"Coach Andy Hamilton
said, “but I’ve always had this goal
tor Gtinnell to individually win
every ﬂight, and we were actually
in the ﬁnals for every ﬂight and
we came up short at number three
doubles. It was a really great ace
complishment to get everyone to
ﬁnals.”
Like Fox, Hamilton attributes
the success of his team at conference to
their familiarity with playing tough teams.
“We played very well, nndauntcd," Hamil-
ton said “No nervousness at all and I think that’s a
byproduct of us playing a great schedule."

nis Team will coinpete in the NCAA Division
III regional at DcPauw University. The com-
petition starts with a game against Westmin-
stcr (11-11) at 1:00 pm.

“It was very exciting to know we made it,"
Katie Colver '09 said, “but we also kncw wc
had a strong chance ofwinning and getting to
where we are."

Coach Andy Hamilton is both proud of
the team and optimistic about their prospects.

“We are excited about our mMCl‘rup with
Westminister this Friday,” Hamilton said.
“since they play a spring season and we play a

fall season, the main question of the outcome
is how sharp our players are with their games
into the match."

This is the ﬁrst regional for the ﬁvettime
MWC champions. While the team hopes to
do well, they also hope to take in all that they
can from the experience.

“Grinnell women's tennis has never won
a regional hetore,”Tatyana Sukl'iarnikovn ’12
said. “That's wlin'in not very nervousThis is
a big milestone."

“I remember when we weren't doing so
well at conference,"Toby Cain '12 said. "I was

round and our team made the qualiﬁcdtion for
nationals, we all ran into the court and had a
giant group hug.”

Colver made history last fall when she
became the ﬁrst player in the history of the
MWC to .win 12 individual championships
