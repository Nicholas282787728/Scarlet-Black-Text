Brown on his way ro Harpers Ferry was essenrrally an rnsurrecrion againsr

srarr a college. Grinnell Universiry was srill in its planning srages when
lowa college in Davenport was srsrred. lows college wasn’r feeling very
welcome in Davenport Apparenrly, some thought rhar rhe rown was too
seedy, and supported a few roo many prosrlrures 1.13. Grinnell found rhe
perreer solurion in inviting iowa college ro use his land (or rheir campus.
Iowa College picked up and moved ro rhe rown otGrinnoll where is re
mained under rhe name Iowa College unril 1909.

“The rown was planned ro have a college. They grew up rogerhcr,"
slid Catherine Rod, the associate llbrarian of the college and college :rchl»

Library assisranr Cheryl Neuberr added, “Just like siblings, rhere have
been ups and downs over rhe years "

The College and the town, as Red noted. have been “absolutely inter-
twincd sinee rhe beginning. "

Ar rhe gala. Golda Sleeuwenhoek orrhe rown rells her srory or the
rown/gown sibling rivalry. “1m 78, and I've lived here all my life." She
tells a story from when she was a lirrle girl back in the 1930s, “We always
liked rhem," she said referring ro rhe srudenrs, or rhe rown folk as she
called rhcm back then, She rells about how her brorher used ro rake rhe
rown folksnipe hunrrng. They‘d go down one ofrhe back counrry rords
ro rhe end ota direh where the college srudenr was rold ro hold our n seek
into which rhe sniper would supposedly lump. When asked whar a snipe
is, she laughs. “Nothing" shesaid. Srill laughing, she adds, “Oh, we were
naughryl”
