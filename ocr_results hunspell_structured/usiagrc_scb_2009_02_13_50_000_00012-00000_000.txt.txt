Defending The Writer's Digress

A letter in last week’s SE58 offered a scarhr
ing critique of Mira/er; Digr'm nr azure, tier
scrrbing its “neally every page" as “oppressive
and deeply offenslvcni an attack against
women, AIDS victims, and the mcritilly
handicapped. As producers of this magazine,
we question the validity ofthis condcrrinarioir,

We agree with the authors in that “it is
neither appropriate not responsible to distrib-
ute blatantly misogyrrrstic, classisr, and ablcist
material.” But the content of Writ/m": Drgim
falls into none of these categories, and in fact,
occasionally pokes fun at those who hold such
ignorant views,

Indeed when taken out of context, some of
our material may appear offensive, most no»
tably the words of the ﬁctional “DJ Koobb.”
But W1 inn": Digrz’i'r is a satirical publication.
Amidst a large amount ofinnocenr, stupid l'iur
mor, a few of its pieces employ irony to make
a point. Yes, the words of“I(oth" were ostene
sibly misogynistic, unlike the sentiment of aut
that Gary Kahn. Kahn purposefully used this
over the top language as a means to poke fun
at male chauvinists,while also making light of
his own often misrepresented image on cam-
pus,

We regret if it took a close reading to in—
terpret the article, or any other piece in the
magazine. We assumed that the magazine’s
tagline—"Stories About Nothing, Advice You
Shouldn’t TakeL adequately contcxrtializcd
the message of our pieces. But for the tastes
ofsome students, perhaps we missed the mark.
Such is the risk of satire—whether found on
the cover ofthc New York”, or within the con—
fines ofa goofy and fledgling campus magar
zine (Come on one of our best pieces was
a buttjokc).

We can understand how Kahn's piece may
have been misinterpreted. But the authors
of last week‘s opinion continued their cti-
tiquc further labeling Wmer'r Digrcrr as both
"ablci, " nd “classist.”While we consider our
"ablcist' tie the result of another misinterprr
tation—the mcrc mention of the cognitively
disabled does not inherently signify intolcrr
autoiwc simply cannot pinpoint any article
even brushing upon the concept ofclass, with
the exception ol‘a t‘ake petition calling for the
overthrow of the “capitalist bourgeoisie pigs"
(Isn't that why we all chose to enroll hero in
the first place?)

if oui detractors W|Sl’l to offer constructive
criticism and to form a meaningful dialogue,
we invite them once again to help us clear up
this confusion. Otllcrwisc, we deem that activ-
ist energy may be hcrrcr spent addressing more
relevant social problems both locally and nar
rionally Let’s face it—women still lack equal

Response to Writer’s Digres:

First of all, thanks to Jim Malewitz, Edir
tortiil-Chlef of Writer-i Digrerr, for contacting
us directly regarding our letter in the 553’}? last
week. We really appreciate the openness of this
back—and—fotth and we value being part of a
community that can respectfully engage in this
kind ofhonesr dialogue,

We received feedback that our initial let-
terlefr people curious as to the specifics of our
grievances. We would like to take the opporr
tunity to specify some of the comments with
which we took issue, and allegedly “so grossly
misconccived."

We would like to begin by discussing some
of our “mrsinrerprerations” from the advice
colrrmn on page it). As a male with presum-
ably somc amount of privilege, “Koobs” was
oppressive in his choice to make light ofsextral
assault, objectification ofwomen, and women
as inherently materialistic. While we can con
cede that the publication as a whole seeks to
present a space in which one can be intention-
ally pejorative, the objectification of women
as merely a collection of oriﬁces as well as the
graphic nature of “Koobs'” advice oversteps a
boundary. When talking about fucking every
hole, the joke is not that Koobs is so misogyr
nisric, but rather the idea ofohjecrifylng won-r
en in this manner becomes something to joke
about. We don’t think it's funny, and it makes
trs incredibly uncomfortable.

Looking to the article on Forrest Gump,
we resent the assumptions presented about the
scxualil’y of people with cognitive disabilities,
as well the capabilities in general of pcoplc
wirir mental disabi itres, Additionally, we
found the use of Jenny to draw a connection
between drug use, “gold digging,” and deviant
female sexuality to be extremely problematic.
While we appreciate the chronological flaws
pointed out by the arrrhor of this section, we
do not recognize a necessary inclusion of this
ablcist and classist matei‘ial.

it‘s the lrttic things
ill.“ rake the e.
second that eventu-
.rllv add up to big
dilfcrcnccs in .rrry
type of consumpr
tion and wrste.

But you miv srrll be asking vourself rvlry
should i" reailv c'are.> \ou should care because
baby polar bears are iust so darn cute and the
tlrorrgbt oi‘thcrn tlrorvrring because ormcltrng
ice from global warming makes me w it to try.
So think about the baby polar bears next time
you leave rlre water on or you could shower
with a friend and save water ursr saying

 

We would also like to highlight the prolr
lemrtrt tone oftbe roles section We tppreciate
the comedic effect of urotieling this page after
tl rose of Rat/trio: r Drgtrt, brrt we are ilicrcdibl v
disappointed and urranruserl by thrs partrcular-
selection of iokes in this one page section,
urinal Digrrtr makes light of learning dis—
abilities, physical disabilities, and pedophilia.

We {ch that it is about time that we agree
to disagree. we recognize tlrar we all have dif
ferent ideas of what constitutes appropriate
language use and effective satire, and while it
is inrporranr that we be able to express our dis-
comfort,wc leave I‘l’i‘i/t'r'rDigi‘m to make their
own judgment calls. Thanks again to Wrildr':
ngrtttr for participating in this healthy debate,
and although this will end our hostile takeover
oftbe opinion section, we hope that the write
at: and editors of Wi'im ’l Drgicls will make a
concerted effort to selfeevaluatc in the future.

Students advocate for faculty

Considerin ecent events, we feel that it
is our responsi ty as current students to ex-
press our solidarity with the faculty effort to
increase the transparency and accountability of
Grinncll’s administration.

We support an external review otthe deparr
ture ofSheree Andrews, as proposed by some
members ofthc faculty. Andrews’dismissal has
brought on an unhealthy atmosphere ofsuspit
cion and distrust among students, faculty and
staff. We believe that this external review may
help restore the community’s confidence in
our institution.

We condemn the cease and desist letter den
livcrcd to Profcssor Ralph Sawrese as an act of
intimidation designed to restrict studenttfact
ulty interaction. We believe that open dialogue
between faculty and students is necessary for a
healthy college community.

The issues that we have with the admin-
istration are community issues and cannot be
resolved on an individual level Access to and
the involvement of all members of the come
murrity is imperative for the resolution of our
concerns.
