ARTiSTS'iN'RESidENCE .

by Elaine Carey
Artists will still reside at Grinnell contrary
to popular rumor stirred by the resignation oi
the Manhattan String Quartet which raised
doubts about the iuture oi the program.
Already eliorts to replace the Quartet have
been initiated The iormer Grinnell Fran
cesco Trio, the Music Department, the
Executive Council, and Richard ldowe, a
iormer music department chairman are all
searching lor possible replacements Any
recommendations will undergo the normal

approval by the Executive Council and the
president, '

Artists-lnrResidence is a “built-in nation”
for Grinnell College, according to President
Glen Leggett. The philosophy of the program
is threefold, as outlined by Dean Waldo
Walker. Emphasizing no reduction plans for
the program, Walker explained that the
college is interested in oiiering variety oi
entertainment and cultural opportunities.
Additionally, ArtistsAInrResidence is a strong
drawing card, ior potential students.
However, the most obvious reason tor the
residency at Grinnell would be the cultural
paucity in the greater community Without the
college program.

A signiiieant change that is occurring with
Grinnell’s residential culture is a new hiring
requisite demanding that the artists teach as
well as periorm, This demand is the result oi
a transition in iunding during the residency’s
history.

The program was iirst established with
Ford Foundation iunds, matched with college
lunds, in the early 1960’s which enabled the

in 1953 With the expiration of the Ford
matching grant, the college obtained a
Rockeieller grant to continue funding,

The Lennox Quartet terminated their stay
at the college oi their own accord, with the
Francesco Trio replacing them. The Trio
remained until the spring at 1972, quitting also
hy their own decision.

different circumstances as they resigned
under pressure The monetary support oi the
Quartet comes solely from the operating
budget without grant support. Expected
budget cuts and orders to reduce faculty size
have prematurely terminated the Quartet’s
residency. in replacing the quartet, the
College is economizlng by pursuing a trio.

Artists-lnrﬁesmence was termed “a
necessary luxury” when it was placed in the
operating budget. but more academic work in
the iorm oi one-third teaching was then
believed required oi the group to substantiate
their claim to budget money.

Although the college claims the Artistsrlnr
ReSldence program is iirmly planted into the
college philosophy, that honor will quickly
wither and die if overburdened and unr
demuurished. Budget Cuts will definitely
starve the quality Grinnell is able to obtain in
the next group. Weighty teaching responr
sibilities will choke the concept of resident.
artistry ii teaching time swallows up practice
hours. Those practice hours are the attraction
to such a program [or the artist and the ins
surance oi quality artistry tor the college.

the funding,
CulTURE

The state of cultural input at the
professional level in Grinnell is in
financial trouble. The permanent art
collection is in the safest position, but
even it is based on a "modest yearly
fund.”

The artists~in~residence program is
considered to be a “necessary luxury“
by the administration, but we have
already witnessed the premature
departure of the Manhattan String
Quartet in an effort to save the cost of a
salary position. ll is fortunate that the
College is able to "find money” to hire
artists such as Sedmara Ruishein, but
the College has lost more than the
Manhattan String Quartet in Its
economy drive. its reputation as an ideal
place for professional ensembles has
also been hurt. Coupled with its distance
irom either coast, the College has
greatly aiiecled its tuture ability to

The public events commilte needs a
definite commitment by SGA to provide
sufficient funds so that the committee’s
effectiveness may return to its l97l-7Z
level of success. The administration has
remained a steady source of support,
while the music department preferred to
desert the wobbly Ship rather than
remain and bolster the budget and the
committee’s financial power to purchase
contract deals.

Mosi of these decisions were made on
a short~ierm and a well»rneaning basls,
but the results have been detrimental to
the role of culture at Grirlrlell. If the
catolgue is to remain true to its claim to
have “all the advantages oi clean, open
spaces in an attractive, rural counr
lryside without being isolated from
cultural activites and the ’real world',”
then longerange goals must be set and
