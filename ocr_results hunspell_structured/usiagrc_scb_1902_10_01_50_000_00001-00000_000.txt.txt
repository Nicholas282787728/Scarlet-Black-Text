THE HONOR G.

The Conditions tor Earning and Wearing
the :3 Should be Settled. New
Emblem Suggested.

There are several matters cons
nected with the athletic union
that are in an unsatisfactory con-
dition. The debt still exists and
an eitort will be made to pay it
this year. For sometime the
matter of the honor"G” has been
unsettled. A year ago the old
conditions for wearing the "G"
were strickcn off the books, and
sincetliat timenothing has been
done. This matter should be are
ranged. The whole thing is now

in the hands of the board of cone
trol and a little correspondence

would enable the board to decide
on the new conditions. It is sug
gested that with the new condi-
tions a new emblem be adopted.
That is. that there be something
distinctive about the “G” granted
that will show inwhatdepartment
of athletics it was earned. A
base ball man would doubtless
prefer to have aﬂG" which would
show that it was won on the base
ball diamond rather than in foot
ball oron thetrack, and vrceversa,
At the State University the “1’s"
for track and football and so on
are of different sizes. A small
V“F” or “B" might be placed inc
side the “G“ or some ollier way
ol distinguishing the different der
partments of athletics adopted.
Another thing that ought to be
settled is the matter of the trophy
room. At presentthe room isa
dark one on the north side of the
men's gymnasium, which has one
key, as far as can be learned, and
that one is not kept at the gym-
nasinin. Grinnell has a number
of traphies that are worth taking
care oi. and they should be put in
a glass case and placed where
people could scethein instead of
remaining shut up in a dark room.
These matters have simply been
neglected. but they are really of
someimportance and should be
looked into. The cups were in a
better place in the old case in the

library than in the gymnasium as
at present. Several plans have
been suggested and there are vari—
ous ways in which the trophies
might be displayed. At least
they should be put where they
may be seen on request whichis
not the case at present.

 

DEEATING
Exceptional Opportunities tor Good Work
in Debating and Dietary this Year

Those who know the condition
of things at Cornell college this
year declare that there is the same
enthusiasm at Mt. Vernon [or doc
hating and oratory that always
has existed. Cornell meets larger
colleges every year, and it reports
are true. has never lost an llller‘
collegiate debate. Ar Grinnell
this year there are exceptional
opportunities for along
these lines. For keen quick thot,
and for painstaking investigation
and study there better
practice than debating. It offers
a method of intellectual develop-
mentand training that is rarely
equaled in any other department
of college life. Where ever a
man may cast his lot in later lite,
a little practice in college, for
public speaking will he useiul.
And if he does the work with
enough care and perseverance and
becomesan exceptional speaker‘
he will alwayshave an accomplish»
ment that will help himin dlﬁﬁcult
places and otten lead him to
higher places.

But the art of speaking so as
to please and convince must be
developed like any other talent.
It is not inborn ready ior use. It
is an accomplishment to be do
quired by study and practice. We
have tlicsocieties for experience
and practice, and every student
who neglects society work is this-
sing something that the college
has to offer; and this year there
is an experienced teacher in
oratory and expression on the
faculty. There is every opportunr
ity for studying public speaking
in a scicntiﬁc way and for getting
exercise in the art before the
literary societies.

‘ The time to begin such work is
the ﬁrst year in school. It is
easiest then and gives the longest
time for training and
merit.

GAME WITH HIGH SCHOOL

Tl-ie Varsity, Handicapped by Loss or
Men. Puts up a Poor cramc —
No Score.

The
game known as football as put up

worst exhibition of the
by an Iowa College team was wit-
nessed on Ward Field last Satur-
day when the ’Varsity lined up
against the high school. Neither
side was able to cross the other‘s
goal line.

The team being unable to make
connections on account of the
tardiness of the Iowa Central,
souglita practice game with the
high school, Tire ﬁeld was very
muddy and it was only with great
diPﬁculty that the plays could be

started. The line up was nearly

the same as in the Alumni game

a week previous.

A few minutes after the kickoff,
Captain Evans was forced to re-
tircbecause of a twisted ankle, and
this, coupled wrth the absence of
Roode and Benson, materially
weakened the team. Van Liew
was shifted to half and Milo Smith
called into quarter. During the
entire game the only exhibition ol
team work was shown in the sec
ond half. Then a few plays were'
made with everybody in the game

On the other hand. the high

college team and are at least oi

This week the team is receiving
