Chaplin series concluding

by Georgia Denle/

The Charlie Chaplin Film Series con-
eludes in the next few weeks with three
iilms, all departures irom Chaplin’s
wellrknown tramp characterizations.
THE GREAT DICTA'I‘OR, Written, pro
duced. and directed by Chaplin,ditiers
from the early films in a number of
ways: It is Chaplin's iirst dialogue
film; it carries a political message; and
it presents new and dilferent faces of
Chaplin’s genius.

Because THE GREAT DICTATOR
was to be Chaplin’s first dialogue film,
he deCided w create fresh characters
lor it rather than to attempt to alter the
pantomime style oi the tramp. Two
characters emerged, the unassuming
proprietor oi a small barber shop in the
Jewish ghetto oi Tomania. and the
country's maniacal dictator. Adenoid
Hynkel. The barber spends years in a
mental hospital suiiermg irom amnesia
induced by a World War I battle injury.
He then returns to his Jewish
neighborhood oblivious to the changes
mat have occurred in his country since
we rise oi the dictator Hynkel. The
struggle he and his neighbors wage to
outwit the l-iynkel iorces provides the
basis for one-half of the iilm, Parallel-
ing this is the story oi the Hynkel plot to
double-cross rival dictator Benzino
Napolom of Bacteria.

MONSIEUR VERDOUX, released in
1947. abandons all vestiges oi iormer
characterizations and, in a complete
turnabout, presents Chaplin as a
modern Bluebeard, Audiences ol' the
time were unprepared for so severe a
transition and refused to accept the
iilm. Aiter a tew months, Chaplin
withdrew it from circulation and did not
release it again until 1964. Separated by
24 years irom the popular tramp
Characterization, it then became an iris
tant success.

LlMEL!GllT, when released in 1955,
was widely rumored to have been plan-
ned by Chaplin as his last film, and it is
the opinion oi most Viewers that this
was the case. Chaplin plays Chalvero,
an elderly music hall comic who is con
vinced mat he no longer has the power-
to move audiences to laughter. Clare
Bloom, in her iirst major role, plays a
young ballet dancer whom Calvero
guides to prominence as a prima-
ballerina while his own Career seeming-
ly fades into obliVlon. This story of age
giving way to youth has much oi the
same bitter-sweet tinge apparent in
many oi Chaplin's earlier iilms, Here,
however, because Calvern‘s situation
closely parallels Chaplin’s, the picture
appears to be a personal farewell. In
this sense. LIMELIGHT provides an
appropriate close to the Chaplin series.
