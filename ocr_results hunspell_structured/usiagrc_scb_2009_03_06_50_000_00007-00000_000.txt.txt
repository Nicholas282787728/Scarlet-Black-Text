So as a Grinncll alum and as some-
one who grew up here,
how docs it feel to come
back?
It feels great because
my parents live here and
I only see them about
once or twice a year.
[And] even though I‘
graduated five years ago,
there are still people I
know through basketball
or music or people that
I just happened to have
met, so it still kind of
feels like home.
SebringeLewis is
[also] a fantastic place to
sing, it has great acoustics and sound. It's
also a really warm crowd. You know they’ll
appreciate your singing even if you aren’t
singing well.

You were involved in Can Brio while
you were here . What was your favorite
song?

I loved singing “Africa” by Toto, it's
the perfect a cappella song. I also enjoyed
“Gangstas Paradise” [by Coolio].

What do you miss more, performing at
Grinnell or playing Grinnell Basketball?

(Laughs) Idldn’t get to come home for
the Midwest Conference Tournament, so I
watched it online and talked with my old
friends about it, and that made me miss it a
lot. I am still performing, so I still get that,

and 1 play basketball every once in a while,
but it’s nothing like playing here. I’m five
years out, but give me a month or two andI
thinkl can keep up. I miss [Grinnell base
ketball] a lot, especially since my dad [Emil
Malinowski] was the assistant coach,

But instead of music after graduation,
you opted forTeach forAmerica.
lthought that I might Want to reach for
a career, but since I only rook one education
class, I thought Teach for America would
be a good way to circumnavigate the whole
teacher-training process.
Also, my senior year, I had a lot otrhroat
trouble. I actually had my tonsils removed
and sang my senior recite
al on steroids, which was
really nice. It was like
performance enhance
ing drugs for musicians,
But it meant I couldn‘t
go directly into graduate
school for voice because
I would not have been
ready for the auditions.
So [Teach for Amer»
ica] let me teach and do
something of service,
which I thought was in
portant. And it also gave
me time to let my throat
heal before I eventually
knew that I wanted to go back to school for
singing,

So you’re currently back at school and
pursuing a master‘s degree at the Marines
college ofMusic in NewYork City. What’s
it like living in New York and what‘s your
favorite part about it?

My favorite part about New York City is
the opera.The opera scene there is probably
the best in the world. I can get orchestra
tickets, same~day, for a performance at the
Metropolitan Opera House for 520. You
just have to stand in line for an hour or two.
I see the best singers, and it's an irreplacer
able part of my education as a singer be
cause I get to see so much from learning
from people’s mistakes.

Picking apart the world of Harry Potter

The best part of the world of wizardry? Asking logical questions to show why none of it can ever apply to the real world

The Captain (my roommate Anna Werner ’09) and I fre-
quently have argnrrncnts about J.l<, Rowling’s seven-part Harry
Puller opus. Having read more fantasy novcls than I knew ex-
isred, The captain has reached a point where she takes their
fantastical worlds too seriously, producing some rather amusing
critiques. Luckily, her problems with Harry Prim fit nicely into
a few main points.

“Hogwarts doesn't reach any life skills! where do they all
work? They can't all be small business owners or Ministry
workers. What do they do

a little tight with all those small businesses having to employ
everyone unqualified for the MoM, but luckily, that giant War
Against Evil killed off the less—talented wizards, opening up
employment opportunities for at least a couple years.

“When the whole magical world was in trouble, why
didn’t they contact their friends in other countries?"

They did! At least, the ones that had been mentioned in
other books. Yes, all five of them. Or maybe I'm remember
ing another fanflc. Even so, England's position as Voldernert's
home turf definitely made

 

after they graduate?"

The fan-fiction world has
tried to tackle this question
with a surprising lack of cree
ativity, featuring Harry as an
Auror or a playboy living off
his inheritance, while Hermie
one becomes anything from a
Healer (many authors invent a Magical Medical School) to an
Auror to a Flourish and Blotts register jockey. 0n the other
hand, Ron finds a rivermg future as an unemployed burn, an
Auror, or a vampire.

The average Hogwarts graduate can be anything they want
to he, just like your high school guidance counselor suid, pro-
vrdctl then o.w,L, scores are high enough. The young wizards
who barely scrape Acceptable ow. lerd remarkably parallel
lives to those kid in hrgh school wrtr similar grade ~hrwing
little magic b res and aging around hornc workrng ut the
magical etnnvalcnt nfu gas station. Granted, the job market rs

it the front for the War
1 Against Evil. But you still
have to think that inter-
national wizards fought
cvildocrs within their own
borders, leaving Voldemort
to Harry and the rest of his
British companions. Now,I
am not familiar with Muggle politrcs, let alone Wizard politics,
but when was the last time England asked for help with a war
on its home front? Maybe they’vejust forgotten how to ask,

“Why don't theylearn Math or Latin? Latina lingua dew
rum est!"

What sclf—rcspcctingwizilrd needs math? lsn'tAritlrmrrncy
something about math’ Besides, higherelevel rnutlr rs bis ally
magic anywlty. They also don‘t have credit cards or taxes to grip
plc rvrth. The most complicated math that appcurs throughout
the strrcs is ﬁguring out exactly how many ltnnrs are in .r srcklc
and how man) Sicklcs in a Galleon, which oven Rowling can’t

do. Wizardrng England doesn't appear to be a democracy or
any sort, so no one even needs to know how to count votes. I
wrsh I lived in a world that put magic over math.

Excusiug the lack of Latin is trickier. After all, the major—
ity ofspells are based in Larin—Crucio,Wingardium Leviosa,
etcibut it seems that the students never learn anything quite
as difficult as the linguistic roots of their everyday spells,

“Don't they need Latin to make up spells?"

They can totally make up spells. snipe did it while he was
in school and his little Levicorpns spell caused a good bit of
trouble. In the end, I’d rather assume that the Sorting Hat
clandestinely implants a magic LatinemeEnglishetoeMugice
spell translator into the mind ofevery incoming student. Har-
doesnt realize that it happens, so neither do we.

“Can you refuse an invitation to Hogwarts? Home school
crjust ignore magical teaching altogether? Is that legal? It
shouldn‘t be.“

If in fifth grade I had the chance to leave 041ml Run El—
ementary for a school where I could blow things up, tly on a
broomstick, and live away from home, I gnrarantee that no con-
siderations ofmy career would have entered my mind. But if
my parents disagreed, there's probably a power—binding spell
that has turned the ambitions ofmany prepubescent wizards.

or course, the easiest defense to .rny Harry Potter fallacy is
that because it is outside ot’l larry’s experience, rt is also outside
of the macro. l , a fantasy novel; why .houltl J,l(, Rowling
