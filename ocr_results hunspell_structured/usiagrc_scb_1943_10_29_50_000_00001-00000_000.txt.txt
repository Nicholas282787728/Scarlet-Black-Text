By Lucia Carter

Here come the Indians (real
ones). ‘

But actual redskins imported from
Tama are only a part of the Pio-
neer Days crowd at Grinnell,
others will include costumed Gib-
son girls, cowboys, pioneers of all
sorts, and various bearded gentle»
men from Macy. And to add to
the picture therewiilbe, besides
the army men stationed in Grin-
nell,
uniforms of various branches of
the service.

A feature of the celebration“
will be the naming of the Gibson
girl at the dance Saturday night.
Here Pioneer Days claim a dis-
tinction over Homecomings and
‘othcr celebrations of the past.
Grinnell has had queens before (in
fact one year a queen was
crowned at every dance), but this
year is the first that the college

 

the returning alumni in the'

Beards, Bustles,
Indians Tonight

has picked a representative Gibson
girl. Will it last? Will long dress
es and upswept hair does triumph

[over flannel shirts and slacks and

handanas? How representative,
will the Gibson girl become. Is
the bustle coming back to Grin-
nell'.’

However, lovers of the modern
life point out that the Pioneer
Days program includes too many
twentiethecentury events to indi-
cate a real‘retum to frontier life.
Beards and long skirts will ink
for a weekend, but not perman-
ently, with snake dances and mil—
itary reviews and girls hockey
games and tea dances.

Although short skirts and shav—
en faces are expected to return to
Grinnell next week, for a few
days events and costumes will
create an atmosphere of actual
“pioneer days". But what if the
men decided to keep their beards?
That remains to be seen.
