III-VII, this

by John Wylie

Grinnell’s student security patrol
spent a quiet inaugural weekend,der
voting the bulk of its time to look
ing and unlocking doors and check
ing identification cards.

Students appeared mostly apather
tic about the patrol, Associate Dean
of Student Affairs Jim Tederman
said his office has received nocom-
plaints about the program and added
that “on the campus, if people are
bothered about something, they com-
plain".

Al Cubbage and Harold Day, two
students who served on the patrol
during its lirst night, report that
a few students were annoyed about
finding doors locked after 10 p.m.,
but that over all students appeared
apathetic,

Cubbage and Day agreed that the
patrol had been basically tiring,
but dull, They reported having to
lock and relock doors that dormitory
residents had blocked open.

“Every time we saw a Pag's der
livery boy come out oiadorm where
we hadn't let him in, we knew we

were in trouble”, Cubbage recalls.

Both felt that the patrol was effec~
me if, for no other reason, be-
cause potential trouble makers knew
that “sombody is around”. But they
added that, in their Opinion, the
patrol should be operated on a high-
tly basis if it is retained.

Tederman commented that nightly
operation is a possibility for the
future, but that the current patrol
is simply a test operation

He agreed with Day and Cubbage
that the first weekend was not res
presentative, because of the press
sure at impending linal examinae
tions,

“The patrol will defi istely run
next year”, he told the 8313, But
he added that, after the first three
or tour weeks of the year, the ens
tire program will be careiully eve
aluated and revised,

“We will look at the patrol’s logs,
take some type of allrcampus eval-
uation, and then modify the patrol
program" Tederman added that,
if the first weekend is an indication,
patrol hours could conceivably he

Boards Bock Action

by Brent Schondelmeyer

On the heels of the Dean's Open
Forum, the Joint Boards, in a reg-
ularly scheduled meeting, caucused
and endorsed unanimously the pros
posal Scott Well presented to Bean
Walker during the Forum.

The proposal would elevate the
Sub-Committee on Educational Pol-
icy to a full standing committee of
the college and the Board of Trus-
tees. The composition ofthe commi»
ttee would not be any different than
it currently is, but would make it
automonous of the Executive Council
of which it is currently a sub»
committee.

Discussion of the proposed letter
to be sent to incoming freshmen and
high school counselors followed.
It was pointed out that the action was
an_individual one and that if the let-
ters were to be sent out they Wold
be sent to the Student Body and the
Joint Boards for their approval,
in discussion after the meeting,
members of the committee that pre»
sented the letter stated they would
mail the letter as individuals whe-
ther it received approval, but not
in any official role.

Prior to the Joint Board meet-
ing knowledge of the letter was ll»
mited to the Executive Board and
key individuals who helped in the
formulation of the letter.

In other considerations the Yack-
nin proposal to designate one of the
hall officers as the SGA represen-
tative and the other as the House
President passed by a vote of 12»
5-0 to go in effect for 1974-75.
in a separate proposal to make the
action retroactive to include this
year’s hall officers was defeated
by a vote of 771070,

Also of concern were two issues
of campus»wide concern earlier in
the year —_ pets and lettuce. Decir
sions on these two matters were
limited to this year only and cone
tinuation must take the form in
implementation {or their continuen-
ce.

When the lettuce boycott was ini-
tially approved no time for the pro-
posal was stated. It was based on
the assurance that lettuce other
than Teamster’s iceburg lettuce wo-
uld be available. Since that time,
however, there have been occasions
where SAGA was unable to obtain
lettuce for periods of up to a week
at a time. In lieu of this fact,
SGA voted to continue the boycott
effective through September 26 of
next fall at which time the boycott
would he reconsidered, The vote
was 1075—1, i

The Pet Policy is due for re
consideration as it terminates at
the end of the year. it will be acted
on at the next Joint Board meeting
so that some policy can be estab-
lished before students return next
fall.

A resolution was introduced urg-

ing Hall President's to Shirk their
responsibility to not attend meet-
ings, Lack of attendance at faculty
meetings was cited in the Dean’s
Open Forum and attacked by varia
ous students, The resolution inten-
ded to make sure that SGA was not
guilty of attendence deliquency and
rival the quorumless crew that pre-
Ceeded them.

it was announced that $800 remain-
ed in the Social Coeordinator'sbud-
get that will he carried over to
next year. The budget was increa-
sed by $3,500 in the new budget
and the additional revenue will in-

crease monies allocated to student
social activities by $4,300.

Survey Views

by Brent Schnndelmeyer

Emprlcal results from the survey
on student life at Grinnell have not
been tabulated yet, but an examina—
tion of the responses sheds some
tentative insights to student acade-
mic and social perceptions of the
Grinnell experience,

In the area of academics, many
students felt the need to earn good
grades derived from a desire to
attend graduate school and strigent
admittance standards,

The work necessary to earn the
grade was determined by the courr
ses taken. Some students Were 5e],
ective in the courses they were
taking to maintain a high grade
point average and thus avoided some
electivesy that they would have liked
to take Overrall, Career goals had
a significant inlluence on academic
study.

Students tended to study between
4 and 5 hours a day, distributed
between the library, individual
rooms, lounges and various other
locations on campus.

Opinions varied as to the source
of excessive work. Many felt respon-
sibility rested with the professor,
others felt it was the student, while
others felt it was a combination
of both. Some students son that they
spent an inordinate amount of time
studying while others wished that
they could have more time topursue
academics,

For many, individual schedules
were so tight they they couldn’t

shortened somewhat in the early
hours or the morning.

Tederman, Cubbage andDay agreed
that the period from 4 to 8 am.
was “pretty dead". Tederman added
that “there is no point in paying
people for working when they aren’t
needed”.

Log Check

A check of the regular BdtG watv
chman’s log sheets for the five
day period including last weekend
reveals that many watchmen spend
virtually their entire shifts relock»
ing doors that have been blocked
open and answering pages to admit
people to buildings alter closing,

One watchman reported being th-
reatened repeatedly by a large ger-
man shepard dog, and he noted on
his log that he “wouldn’t tolerate it
much longer”.

Vandalism

As the year draws to a close, is-
olated acts of vandalism have con-
tinued, A women’s restroom in No-
rth Younker hall was vandalized
Tuesday night, with a steel parti-
tion ripped from the wall and asan~
itary napkin vending machine smaSr
hed.

Physical Plant Director did not
have an immediate estimate of the
damage there, or of damage inCow-
les Hall, where a windoW was br0r
ken the same night.

Grinnell Police also report the theft
of $70 in cash from a resident of
,Younker hall. The residents asked
that his name not be released.

participate in spontaneous activities
without both the activity and their
studies suffering. One student felt
hindered in his social activities in
that he Was not able to do anything
because everyone else was studying,

Students enjoyed social activities
when able to participate, but there
was a general consensus that more
interaction with professors in both
the academic and Social Context.
the academic and social Context
would be desirable,

As one student commented, “how
great it (was) to know that profess
sors (were) people that also get
drunk on weekends."

Most students were moderately
eager about the remainder of their
Grinnell education, with the excep-
tion of a number of seniors who
expressed feelings or apathy.

And to one Student, the most note
able aspect of Grinnell was their
development of what they termed
“a strong aversion to question-
naires."

The questionnaire was distributed

early in the semester in hopes that '

it would give a more acciirate por-
trayal and a better understanding of
the relationship between academic
and social life than if it had been
distributed towards the end of the
semester.

The student life study is being con-
ducted by Kathy Ryerson with the
cooperation of the Student Affairs
Office and son as part of an inde~
pendent protect for sociology.

Kurz said that in one department,
which he refused to name, most of
the laculty members were up for
tenure, and thererore only candi-
dates straight from graduate schr
ool, who would provide no competir
tion, were considered for openings
in the department.

Kurz stressed that this was just
one example of a case where input
could be valuable in personnel mats
ters. He noted that, with both stur
dents and faculty involved, a system
of checks and balances would be
created,

on the elminlatioh of student»fac-
ulty Divisional EPC’s, most stu-
dents appeared to view the move as
a direct slap at the student body,
while the faculty apparently saw it
as a mechanical measure, designed
to streamline operations by elimin-
ating what was seen as a useless
committee.

Dawson, in response to student
comments on the move, said that
most divisiondl EPC's were awaste
of time, because they were at an
intermediate level requiring that ac-
tion on any proposal be taken at both
higher and lower levels.

However, many students disagreed,
saying the Divisional ch had great
potential, and that they should not
have been abolished without student
input and consultation.

Students also appeared upset over
the new 8 credit limitation on praCr
ticum credit. Walker used the rar
tionale that many students had abUr
sed practicum, using it to attempt
early graduation He also said that
some students, petitioning the Au»
demic Standing Committee foroverr
loads, had called practicum credits
“second class credit”.

But several students pointed out
that this statement was being taken
out of context, One music student
noted that Students were attempt-
ing to avoid the extra $100 fee that
goes with the overload and, us he
put it, ”no one wants to pay an
extra hundred bucks".

SGA Leaders

SGA Cabinet members met into the
early hours of Thursday morning,
and drafted a statement outlining
the six part Weil proposal in detail
and giving a very general outline
of the tactics being used.

WINTER CLOTHES

The heart of the proposal is that
the All Campus EPC he made a
regular standing committee or the
College, with authority over all
areas of academic concern. Recom-
mendations or this body, which would
retain the same composition it now
has, would require approval by both
the laculty and the Student Governr
ment Association. Conllicts between
the two groups would be submitted
to the President of the College for
binding reView.

Under the plan, a subcommittee
would be formed to deal with ”al—
ternative and innovative modes of
education at Grinnell College". The
plan also requests that the Truse
tees form a committee to study the
implementation of a Grinnell Come
munity Government guaranteeing
equal rights and responsibilities
to students and faculty in academic
policy.

Weil and Walker both said Thurs-
day that the SGA position was very
clearly set forth. Weil said that he
was going to “go home, study, and
Wait for them to call me”. AndWalr
ker emphasized that linal action on
the proposals could only be taken
by the Board of Trustees.

Walker stressed at the Wednesday
night meeting that the plan proposed
by Weil would require a change in
the bylaws of the College »- ahd
that the power to make such chan-
ges was one right the Trustees
“guard very Jealously”.

Mistrust

But in all the comments made dur-
ing the meeting,‘ a sense of deep
mistrust between students and the
faculty and administration was evi-
dent. And student leaders commen»
ted that the four issues raised dur-
ing the meeting wereiust the culminr
ation of a long period of frustra-
tion.

As Brad Clompus put it, Ihe ac»
tions begun Wednesday were the re-
sult oi a group of student leaders
“sharing the frustrations that have
been building up for a long time”.
