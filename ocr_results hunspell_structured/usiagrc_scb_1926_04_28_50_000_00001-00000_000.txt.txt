Report to Tryout For Tenlu: Six
Dunls Scheduled

The Grinneli tennis team will be
managed this spring by w. Earl Boom
oi the speech depal‘tineiit.. Previous
iy,the tennis team has been managed
by the director of athletics or part-
time coach, Mr. Beam, who is an ar-
dent tennis ian, will work with the
team, and will assist in arranging the
details at the schedule.

Nine men have reported for try-
outs for the team. and the competition
promises to be closer than usual this
year. With Captain Al Nicolet and
West Stotts of last year's team back,
and with the addition or several men
of no mean ability. the Scarlet and
Black hapes for a good court aggre-
gation look promising.

Strﬂble ShO“ Class

George Struble, sophomore net star,
has been playing in mid-season form
in the early spring workouts. and
should be more than reasonably sure
of a berth on the team. Stotts and
Nicolet, are playing in better term this
year. than ‘they showed last year.
These three men no doubt will torm
the nucleus ior the team.

The fourth member will be round
among the other six men who are trye
log out. Foremost among the new-
comers is Ted llovejoy, a sophomore
Lovejoy is a clever l-aqu’et wislder and
should make a strong bid for a place.
Closely on Lovejoy's heels is Floyd
Jones, part-time member oi the last
year's quartette. Paul Smiley, Frank
Dewey. Nelson Royal. and Art Moore
are the other prominent contenders
for the teuith position, it is likely
that there will be several alternates
chosen to lill in in casc or an cmcr

ten by members ol‘ the Play Praline—

is a one not play by Muriel katcliit, is
a song, dance, and dialogue number.
The setting which is a Spanish gar

tistic.

"A Radio N litmure" by Howard
Backus, which is the second number,
is a complete radio program personi-
iied. it is a hizzare and grotesque
take on which is most amusing. The
third number is a ballet based on an
Az‘tec legend with appropriate settings
and costumes. One oi the two entire
acts will take the iorm of an Amer»
ican opera, The setting is on the
titth liner of an apartment building
which is on tire and the occupants
promise to inrnish plenty ot music.
The other eutre act is yet to be chosen
from a number of promising Suggest—
ions, it will probably be an orchest-
rial specialty number.

The production has been under way
ror some time. The sets which are al-
most completed are much more eldb~
crate and pretentious than anything
which has been attempted this year.
The costumes are being de ned. and
all that remains to be done is to com-
plete the drilling or the cast.
