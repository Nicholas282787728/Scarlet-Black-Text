president Maui's M‘ords n a recent
chapel talk about a college song ought
not to he im‘guliell. Songs are ll'JL
likely to be well made to order; that
is. we cannot order them with any 357
surance that we shall get what we
want. [in the other hand the song is
not likely to be written except under
the stimlililsvol some more or less
deﬁnite demand. The uttered prize
ma at some wits to work and the
work thus stimulated may result in
a satisfactory song,

Some may remember an cirort in
this direction a low years ago, which
resulted in two songs that formed a
part of the Glee Club program for a
while, and then ceased to bc snug. A
permanent and valuable result at this
eitort was the Alumni song, which
seems to have made itself a place in
our college lite.

A college song must be a real song.
It must have that indeﬁnite quality
which appeals to the imagination and
calls out the musical instinct. Mainly
matter of rhythmic swing and of
adaptability to a catchy melody, this
quality is the ﬁrst essential.

A college song must embody in some
way the college ideal.

Dicion of

Without a shoe
preaching or conscious
teaching. our song must in some way
utter the Grinnell spirit, and sing that
spirit into the hearts of those who
sing it and those who hear it.

A College song must also have some
literary merit. It may be very simple
indeed in thought. Any subtlety ot
thought or special reﬁnement ot exV
pl'eSsioIl would be likely to spoil its
effectiveness. The really effective
songs have all uttered a simple but
strong thought or emotion in simple
and strong language. ,

song that We shall love to sing has
