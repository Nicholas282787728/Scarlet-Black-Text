Who In The Hall. . . ?

Last Week an editorial examined the
“incident of the ARH chairs" and bewailed
it as an example of “direct violation of
community interest and of the principle of
responsible student government.” That
lethargy exists throughout the framework
of student government was amply evidenced
by the time-lag over two weeks before the
C of HP reluctantly took action concerning
the matter.

“Miss" Violations _

Lethargy in student government how-
ever is, not a monopoly of the C of HP. It
is visible to a high degree in the various
hall governmental structures Either from
fear of arousing the enmity of hall mem-

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

bers, or from faulty functioning of the
sense organs, many of our hall dignitaries
“miss” innumerable violations of “come
linlllity interest”. They thereby neglect
stimulating “responsible student govel'u‘
lllellt” to take immediate and proper cor-
icttive measures. They also invite censure
or action by the college administration.

Indeed, reflection will bring to the
minds of most of us various and frequent
illsdnc s of hall officers pnrti pntiug
wholeheartedly in these manifestations
of student irresponsibility.

Many members of our several house
councils are apparently under the impre
slon that their duties begin and end lvlth
attendance at, or presiding over, A meeting
oi" some sort or other. Their complete failure
to lcalize that they also have administ
live duties, such as l zuntzlining order with-
in the hall and enforcing quiet hours, is
(1 'ite beyond comprehension, especially when
such matters ziri'e repeatedly brought tip in
house meetings.

Respect or Disrespect

Even when empowered to levy i‘ines
ag’ inst violate", the house council seems
content to let things run themselves. In the
hall the individual student comes in corn
tact with student government most often,
and here he learns his respect or his dis
respect for it.

”To insure a reasonable degree of or-
der through out the student body, are -

sonnble degree of order lnllst be insured
in the broad base of that body—namely
in the halls.

Hall officers should come to r ‘llize the
high degree of responsibility that is theirs,
and the individual student should also come
to realle that his full (lo-operation is need-
ed in order to make the hall government a
working organism

Lethargy

The fiery March issue of “independc
ence from the administration” cannot be
attained by the present lethargic, half—
hearted interest of both students and stu-
dent officers in student government. If
at any time we cannot maintain order
among ourselves, the administerial colossus
may justifiably take matters .into its own
hands.

If we really want independent student
government, let’s shake off our lethargy
and begin cleaning up our governmental hi-
erarchy at its baseiin our respective halls.
