SCARLET AND BLACK

ISO party brings Carnival
atmosphere to Grinnell

by David Tavaxez

After the holidays of Christ-
mas and New Year, the rabid
northem winds attack the Westem
Hemisphere. Just imagine the
devastating effects of a gloomy
winter in Europe some hundred
years ago: Days grew colder, and
the penances and taboos of Lent
were just a few days down the
road. What would you do if you
were a Christian European chilled
down to the bones pondering the
upcoming ban on meat
consumption, drinking. sex and
all the other fun things in your
MTV-deprived existence? You
would party hard, of course. just
before it was time to abandon all
carnal pleasures.

European Catholicism sanc-
tioned the custom of having a
marathon celebration just before
Ash Wednesday, the day when all
believers were anointed with
ashes to remind them the futility
of earthly life and put them in the
mood for carnal mortificalion;
self—flagellation and fasting (in
other words. there wasn‘t any
market for Jane Fonda’s workout
tapes). The recipe for sanctity
was simple: you partied, you
fasted, you died. you went to
heaven and partied eternally to the
music of the Dead. ,

Therefore, we owe the idea of
a carnival to the Europeans
Nowadays, there is a broad range
of carnivals to choose from all
over the world, each one featuring
a distinctive atmosphere.
In Veracruz. Mexico, for
example, people confess that they
hoard every cent during the year

 

 

 

 

and squander all of their savings
during Carnival. Tlley note that

infamous for their stinginess, do
exactly the same, except that they
don't have any camival.

The creativity of the revelers‘
minds is admirable. One fine
day. while walking through
Venice on the last day of the
Carnival, I saw masked people
enveloped in yards of vaporous
fabric, ancient Egyptians,
monsters, Italians wearing
blankets and Mexican hats, the

Well, now that you have read
so much about carnivals, would
you feel tempted to drop your
books, cover your body with
strategically placed leaves and
form a samba line from Burling
to ARH? Do not despair:
Grinnell will have a carnival of
its own. The International Stu-
denls' Organization is having the
first Grinnell-in-Rio Carnival,
which will take place on Satur-
day, February 4, at Gardner
Lounge, starting at 9 pm. There
will be confetti, party favors and

Student recounts
Chinese riots

by May-lee Chai

The day after Christmas I had
ﬁnished my fust ﬁnal exam and
was contemplating a nap when
the sound of people shouting told
me something was wrong. I
looked out the window and saw
over 1000 Chinese students
marching down the street. The
demonstratols poured through the
front gate of Nanjing University
and marched to the front steps of
my dormitory.

After shouting a bit and
grabbing a few onlookers‘
cameras, the students dispersed.
But we who were watching
anxiously from the windows
could think only one thing: the
mobs from the Christmas Eve
riot had come for us!

I had heard of the Christmas
Eve riot from two American
friends who had tried to go to the
dance party at He Hai University.
They witnessed a scuffle between
two African students and Chinese
security men that erupted when
the Africans’ Chinese girlfriends
refused to show their IDs. My
friends said it quickly turned into
a “war zone" with both sides
assembling bricks, rocks, and
other weapons.

My friends said they were
quite relieved when the police
arrived. They were horrified,
however, when the police did not
break up the fighting but just
stood and watched. Then some
police officers began to shout, “
Da. Da, Da!" which means
“Fight!" or “Beat!" Some of the
Chinese students, numbering in
the hundreds now, took up the
chant and began shouting, “Da
si!“ which means “Beat to death!“

That night mobs of Chinese
students stormed the Africans'

dormitory, breaking windows,
trashing rooms, and destroying
bicycles.

The next day, Christmas, the
ﬁrst street demonstrations began.
According to my American
professor, over 1000 Chinese
marched in the streets to the
largest foreign tourist hotel and
shouted, “Gan zou hei gui!"
(“Black devils get out of Chinal")
and other such statements.

The Monday (Dec. 26)
demonstrations at my campus
were “to spread the word,” our
Chinese roommates told us.
Rumor had it that a Chinese
security man involved in the
initial ﬁght had died. The stu~
dents were afraid the Africans in-
volved would not be punished
because “the government is too
weak to punish foreigners."

All the African students—
around 130—fled from their
campuses to the train station.
They wanted to go to their
embassies in Beijing, the capital.
The Nanjing government sent
about 40 police officers to
prevent the Africans from leaving
the city.

That evening, Dec. 26, about
5000 Chinese demonstrators took
to the streets. They paraded
around our foreign students‘
dormitory for 45 minutes I saw
groups carrying huge red banners
that spanned the entire width of
the street. The demonstrators
passed out tracts that talked about
the injuries of the security guard
at the dance riot. ‘The [Chinese]
race is being humiliated," one
read. “Any tolerance we show to
the thugs is a betrayal to the
me”

Later that night the police
forcibly evacuated the Africans to
a “guesthouse” in the nearby city
of Yangzhoui The police also
forced from the tlain station four
American women who had been
there to lend moral support to the
