A complete change has taken place in Main hall basement since
the days when it was fashionable to suggest, “How about going down
to tiic rec room?“ ,

In place of the. former recreation room which was open to all
students every evening, a gleaming model kitchen serves as work
shop to the nine girls in Miss Williams honie management class

For Small Dinners

The room on the other side of
the screen has table spaCe for
about so people. Equipped with
dishes intended for Cowlcs private
dining room, it was initiated Sate

ate there. Its proximity to the
Main kitchen and toad supply
make it suitable for dinners of

this type, though President SteV—i

use will be limited to business or
academic groups serving the col-
lege.

The class using this workshop,
said Dean Gardner, is taking a
part of the eutlienics course. Not
as technical as home economics
the aim of euthenics is to better

and keeping house with a liberal
