Chapel Service.

Too many Students whit until their
Senior year to take the time and
trouble to analyze their purpose in
coming to college, or, what is the same
thing, what they expect to get out or
college. \ It is our guess that not a
few enter college_ and continue on
through a tour yesrs course with no
oLher reason in their own minds than
that their friends do it and therefore
they must inevitably do likewise.

life the sooner he will he able to make

One of the complaints which pros—
pective graduates of a, liberal arts cul-
legs such as Grinnell, have to make is
that their college work has not pre-
pared them in a direct way to make

(milling thoy should have investignted
the matter tour years ago and arrived
at tile very obvious conclusion that
lot the

Grlunell, installed, was not

place “here such "(lining could be
gained,"

The purpose or a liberal arts col—
lege, as we conceive it, is to lnrnish
(be broad cultural foundation Du whichl
any sort of a professional super-struc-
ture may he erected. ‘

Take, tor example, courses in door»
nalism, We do not believe that it isl
the business or the journalism depart
ment of a liberal an 5 college to train
reporters. It shuulll i‘nthel‘be the aim
or journalism courses in such institu-
tions to present background material
and a thorough training in journal»
istic writing as a term of literary
composition.

Within theumther hrocd limits at
study Which the liberal arts college 0!-
far: the materialistic attitude of the
present day seems to he swinging the
current of students toward the more
practical courses on the curriculum.
Courses in political science and eco-
nomics have hccnme increasingly pupc
ular while the classical subjects have
assumed a most lowly Dositiou in the
housc Where they once were masters,

This is not to say that the Classics
were\ not uvel'emphaslzed in their
lime. But to-
day the over—emphasis comes on the
so»called practical subjects, '

The Whole movement seems to point

They probably were.

to an effort on the part of college’stua
dents to get some tangible thing out
of the curriculum which they can
deﬁnitely apply to the everyday lite
which is to follow.

This in turn shows an entirely

_ wrong conception at the whole pur-

pose oi a cultural education, The stu-
dent who learns something 01 the cul-
tural polish need have no lesi- that‘he
has not made the most of the oppor-
tunities oticrcd by a liberal arts col—
lesel

This does not mean‘ that the student

should lose touch with the world or
aﬂalrs about him. It is the duty or
every man and woman to do this. But,
just as the main job of the banker is
to run his bank so the main jab of
the Student is to get the must Out 0!

Observation leads us to believe that
the story in the last issue covering
Professor Allln's speech on the Mun-l
roe Doctrine proved to be or some‘
practical ralue to those who neglected
t ake notes (we hesitate to say what
did not attend the lecture). lVe l'ejoice ‘
that we were able to be of service.

Is chapel attendance as large as it
should bet If not, why not? What
improvements can be» made in the
method of conducting the service, ii
any? These are questions concerning
which every member oi the studentt
body should have ideas, That the pres—
ent chapel and Vesper situation has
