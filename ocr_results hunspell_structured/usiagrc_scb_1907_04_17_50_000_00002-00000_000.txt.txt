it Died Hard hut Had to Go.

An impressive funeral service was
held Monday altenooti when the “Col
lege” council, aiter many weeks of
worlt, announced its iailuetc get cve
ery oneiu school to express an upilh
ion as to the Semester Fee. They
had setiortlieinselvesthe nigh wa-
ter marlr oi eighty per cent oi tliestii-
dents in school secured as iaroriiig
the plan, and tailed hy two per cent.
They worked hard and onlya tew
were not seen. They cracked eiery
one down with great peISIStancy, but
uiew dodged eiteetually and escaped
from saying whether or not, they were
in iavor oi cutting down their person-
al expenses by taking l'or sis collars
what iorinei-ly cost iourteeii. Even
though sevenlyseven or eight per
cent oi the students in lowa College
are in inror of the idea the council in
its mighty wisdom has seen lit to let
the matter_rli-op and see their work
{to almost for nothing.

Well, let it he so, The council
could only » l'e“recommall(lail" that
it he adopted anywa . Theiact that
nearly tour lirlhs ii the students in
school llrl\e shown themselves in fav-
or or the plan still remains ior which
the council is on he thanked, and thin

Suchls the case, (rile decision of the
Senior class to wear their caps and

gowns on certain days during the
spring term comes as the lirst note or
awahened class spirit. But it is sad
that the classes should wait until they
are through school to realize that they
are component bodies which have an
indiridnallite. lithe classes would
wire up and have some activities in
which all the members could partich

The following imitation or Brown-

card in the library:
