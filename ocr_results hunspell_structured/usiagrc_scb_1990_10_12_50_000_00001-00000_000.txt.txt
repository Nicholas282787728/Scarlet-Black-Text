News College Rankings

By Jessica Weisel

in the 1990 U.S. Newrand World
Report ranking of the Top 25 Na
tional Liberal Arts Colleges, re»
leased this week, Grinnell ranked
16th. This ranking maria a drop of
six places from last year’s ranking.

Responding to the placement,
PrcsidentGeorge Drakesaid he was
not surprised, but commented that
the ranking “doesn’t reﬂect the
improvement or dimunition” of the
school. Heparticularlyemphasizcd
that the placement follows an ex-
ceptional year for the college, in
which Grinnellstudents andalumni
won prestigious awards ranging
from theNobcl Prize to the Rhodes
Scholarship

Drake stressed the changed cri-
teria for the report.

In its consideration of liberal
ans colleges, the magazine states,
"The methodology (for dcten'nin-
ing ranks) continues to evolve and,
therefore, the 1991 rankings are not
directly comparable to those pub
lished in previous years.“

Grinneil was not the only col-
legeloexpen'encealarge changein
its position among the top 25. Bryn
Mawr dropped 18 places from ﬁfth

t023rd, while Bowdoin moved from
1Ath to founh.

The magazine used five catego»
ties to calculate the relative merits
oteaoh college. Twcntyefive per.
cent of the assessment was deter-
mined by four categories. thc
college’s“academicreputation,” its
”Student selectivity, and its “fad
ulty resources." “Financial re-
sources" comprised 20 percent of
the final score,while“studcntsatis-
faction" made up the ﬁnal five
percent.

To determine “academic repu-
tation,“ U.S. News World Report
polled 4,131 college presidents,
deans and admissions directors, rce
ceiving responses from 60.1 per»
centofthcm. “Studentselectivity”
was computed by calculating the
student acceptance rate, the num»
ber of accepted students who actu»
ally attend the institution, the aver»
age SAT and ACT score and the
number of freshmen who were in
the top 10 percent of their high-
school class.

“Faculty resources" were deter-
mined by the SludenUfaculty ratio,
the percentage of faculty with doc-
torates, the percentage of part-time
faculty,andtheaveragefacullySale

ten sponsor registration tables in
the Forum or at class registration,
but the current drive is more com-
prehensive. It is intended to reach
out personally to all unregistered
students, regardless of political
preference.

“It’s not a partisan thing. We
want everyone to get out and vote,”
said Evan Zoeckler, a member of
the Democrats’ executive council.

BobMahonandRachelBly,also
members of the executive council,
have been in charge of organizing
the voter registration project as a

call with details of how to register.

Mahon said. He added that the
Presidential caucuses coming up in
early 1992 are another reason to
register here.

The campus efforts to register
voters comes in conjunction with a
state-Wide registration drive spears
headed by Secretary of State Elainc
Baxter and the Iowa Democratic
Party. Tens of thousandsof Iowans
have been registered in the past few
months in the "if you don’t vote,
who will?” campaign. The pro-
gram has included everything from
popular appeals on grocery bags to
the inclusion of registration forms
in all state income tax lonrts.

The students of Grinnell Col-
lege represent one of the largest
block of voters in Powcshick
County. As of Sept. 7, the first
Ward in Grinnell, the majority of
which is made up by the college,
had 15.2 percent of registered vot-
crs in the county. The County
Clerk’s ofﬁce stressed that this fig-
ure ﬂuctuates slightly from year to
year due to the high tumover in
population at the college. It was
also stressed by organizers of the
registration drive that if a large
number of students register to vote,
their opinions will be heard.
