NORML Chapter

formed

by Brian Strause

Ted Amann. SGA King for Life, has a
new crusade, In his last six weeks at Grln~
hall, has taken it upon himself to establish
on campus a chapter or the National
Organization [or the Reform oi Marijuana
Laws tNORML). Judging from theturnout
at the organizational meeting, this project
has the ability to make a significant cons
tribution beyond the Grinnell community.

Amann sees a need (or such a chapter on
two levels. ”Personally, I’m very concern
ed with marijuana laws in our country,
and I want to do what I can to change
them. Secondly. NORML needs more
publicity, more outreach to the average
college student. Hopcrully, we can get to
them while their minds are still open."

Although Amann graduates in May, he
sees the planting oi this chapter as the
beginning ot a long relationship with
NORML, Next tall, Amann will be entering
the job force and he recognizes that the
real world might not appreciate his views.
"I'll have to reel out my new employer
next year and see what the atmosphere is
like. if it seems like it's Cool for me to be
openly active and radical at my iirst year
in this place, i will." Regardless oi his one
therjob situation. Amann still plans m sup
port NORML privately, both financially
and through continued correspondence
with government officials.

For the present, Amann has pledged to
build the Grinnell NORML chapter to a
position or campus acceptance. The
chapter's goal is to educate students
through the commonsense technique.
NDRML bases its philosophy on the belici
that continued Marijuana Prohibitinn is
not only a form oi oppression but also
results in the loss of billions uf government
dollars every year. As a means to educate
students. Amann is armed with “Common
Sense" pamphlets and magazines provid-

ed by NORML, He also hopes to bring a
speaker on campus to talk about Mari-
juana Prohibition or the controversy sur
rounding urinalysis testing.

in order to raise money ior continued
growth at the chapter, there are plans of
marketing NORML T»5hirts and buttons. A
bake sale also has been suggested as a
means of encouraging a higher awareness
at the need tor the relorm or existing mari-
juana laws.

The arguments presented by NORML
tend to rely on common sense and are easi-
ly conveyed. It is often pointed out that
research has yet to prove that marijuana
usage is the cause at any serious side etc
lects. Of course, rats have been shown to
develop brain damage with the equivalent
dose at 100 joints a day for 30-40 years.
NORML promotes the idea that the
government’s stand on this issue can be
seen only as hypocritical. Amann noted,
"Sixty million Americans are smoking
dope, Obviously the laws just aren’t work-
ing. . . These people don't seem to be too
deranged. lots of them are
reproducing . ljust don't see the pro-
blem "

Amann realizes the importance or
dispelling the myths surrounding mari~
juana use. It does not cause brain damage,
nor does the drug turn people into crazed
loons ivho swing irom tree to tree. Perhaps
the worst of marijuana's problems is its
association with other, harder drugs, This
association is ielt simply to be a result oi
the black-market nature of sales. Amann
concludes. "when it comes to pot, it’s a
waste or the taxpayer's money. Coke,
crack, and smack.. we ought to crack
down on it. but dope smokers don't do
anybody any harm. We just sit at home
and alter our work is done. we light up and
relax,"
