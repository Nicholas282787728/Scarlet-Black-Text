Dead Hippies Don’t Say, ‘Ouch’

By Mark Baumann

Dead hippies don'tsay“ouch.“ In
fact, real, live hippies, providing
someonecanprovetheyexistprobar
bly don't say muchbeyond an errant
“Unnnnnhh ." Somebody missed tltis
when the now-infamous Students
Against Hippies poster went up and
down and onto the front page of a
studentnewspapernearyourecentlyl

SIA.H., all one ofthem, was taken
to Judicial Council for this poster.
which was seen as a direct and per-
sonal threat by some students on
campus because it had “Spot the
Wonder Dog” taking “action” and
“blowing up” some “hippies." This
was harassment, said some: S,A.Hl

Students Against

threat to Grinnell’s
hippies as Elmer

Bunny.

wants us dead But, the astute din-
ing-hall line-dweller will note, the
poster has the “hippies” saying
“ouch" after a scrawl of magic-
markcr explosion does them in.

This poster is as big a threat to the
so-calledhippiecommunityofGrin-
nell Collegeas the so-called “Elmer"
Fudd was to Bugs Bunny. Obvi-
ously, Elmer will never get Bugs
because the entire act of getting him
defines Elmer‘s existence. Without
Bugs therereally wouldbenoElmer,
and this is why his bulderbuss is
loaded with mulch.

Like Elmer's primitive gun,
S.A.l-l.’sgunalsospoutsmulch,with
no real target or purpose in mind. It
just hopes to hit something, any-
thing, to give it the same sense of
“being” as its more entertaining

cousin Elmer. Surprisingly, they-hit
something with the poster. I still
don‘t understand why the so-called
hippies in this case gave S.A.H. the
satisfaction of hitting its target. Why
didn‘t they just duck?

“But wait," you’re saying. “You
can'tduck an issue like this. This is
a real problem i harassment at any
level is a threat. Who is to say an
action like this won’t snowball until
people get hurt, or killed’.l Who’s to
say they aren‘t going to go out and
load their guns with bullets?" Well,
to answer that, I have one word:
“you’re." I mean, “you are"

Butwhilethe solutionlieswith the
“oppressed" in this case, it is not the
road usually taken. Because the ilk
of Stupids Against Hippies have one
thing right when they say the “liber-
alism" of Grinnell is palatable only
if you subscribe to a pretty well»
determined set of values You don’t
stop a bunch of goof like S.A.H. by
a “No. don’t do that" of judicial
“actionf‘ Forced sequestering of a
groupbecause they profess disagree-
able or offensive views does two
things. It, er, suppresses “freedom"
of speech, and it somehow'legiti-
mizes its existence.

Yes, I know speech has its limits.
that one cannot scream “Fire!" in a
crowded moviehouse, if you’ll for-
give my use of cliché and fallacyl
These limits are put in place to pro
tect the greater population. These
limits are put in place because the
greater population can’t handle a
bunch of “freedom“atoncel'l‘hatcr
they don’t want to. Butallow me to
be elitist and educated for a couple
more years, or at least a few more
paragraphs: We are Ito! the greater
population. We can deal with things
like this.

“We" are a community of smart
folk, Here, at least, people should be
allowed to say what they want. And

and this is imponant, neither side
should be sequestered. No one should
formally be told to shut up, just as no
one should be allowed to rip down
posters before they are outdated 7
this goesequally forGayPridechk
and Students Against Hippos. Ide-
ally, both (or all) parties could get
together, and talk. Get your own
bullhom and yell back. Arm-wrestle
if you want,

But what of speech which goes
beyond the simple insult or the ugly
epithet? What of speech which
implores parents to “shoot their
faggotsons?” If such speech intrudes
on your little “brain.“ then say it
fool. Say it and be labeled an idiot.

The next time
someone yells
‘Fire/’ in a crowded
theater, don’t yell,
‘Shut up!’ Say,
‘Prove it.’

Say it and be shot yourself. Com-
ments like this serve no constructive
purpose, and one should have brains
enough to ignore them.

why beat a dead horse ‘til it smells?
Limiting speech, even this sort of
speech, even harassing speech, is
censorship. And censorship is not

options You need the bad to know
the good.

Besides, trying to give a group
likeS.A.H. formalpunishmcnts only
serves to reinforce the “cause.” In
being punished, the pinheztd(s) in-
volved will feel a renewed sense of
purpose, thatBugs has finally taken
its threats seriously: “Wow. They
weally are afwaidofus! We're fowr
weal!” Never mind it has admitted
hippies don‘texiston this campus, if
anywhere. Conversely, look what
happened when the womyn got to-
gether and decided to rid the world
of “men.” Surely this affected more
people, offended more people, titan
S.A.H. has. But this “conflict" blew
over via simple letterrwriting, and it
has all but been forgotten. Because
the opinions expounded were seen
as irrational if not absurd by many.
Because we are here to he liberally
educated, and that should mean a
tolerance of views, not necessarily
understanding.

Speech should besaid, not snuffed.
And the listener should listen criti-
cally, and judge accordingly. Nei-
ther should not be cmshed, neither
the speaker nor the listener.

So the next time someone yells
“Fire!" in a crowded theatre, don‘t
run. Don’t yell, “Shut up!" Say,
“Prove it." If they can’t, they will
shut up. Or run.

 

S.G.L. Is a Multicultural —
Not a Minority — Group

 

To the Editor:

We, the Student Organization for
Latinas/Latinos, are responding to
the Nov. 3 article “Latina Student
GroupChallengesAdminierationon
Ethnic Diversity.”

We believe that the article was
imprecise in explaining several
imponant points about our organi
zation and proposal; we made these
points clear both in the proposal and
in an interview with The Scarlet and
Black.

First, the article was imprecise in
respect to the name of our organiza-
tion and the language we use to
describe our concerns. Because of
sexism inherent in the language we
use the term Latinas/Latinos and we
object to the non-inclusive use of
either Latinas or Latinos without the
other. We also use the word “multi-
cultural," because “minority” im-
plies inferiority.

Second, we advocate a focus on a
wide range of multicultural issues
(including faculty, students and
courses) and not just multicultural
studies as the second half of the
article impliesl

Third, the article failed to mention
that ASIA, or All Students Inter-
ested in Asia, is a member of the
multicultural coalition.

Although the article focuses on
the negative, stating that the coalia
tion will enable us not to “feel segre-
gated," we view the coalition posia
lively, as an opportunity for us to
work together in pursuit of the same
goals.

And fourth.althoughasthc article

reported, the response to our pro~
posal was“good,”itwas minimal—
abouthrespons“ from 155 faculty
and administration members.

We hope that the campus commu-
nity will join us for the upcoming
latina/Iatino Heritage Week, Nov.
12 through 18. You will have an
opportunity to voice your response
to our proposal this Tuesday, Nov.
14 at 7 pm. in South Lounge when
S.G.A and the multicultural coali-
tion co-sponsor an open forum.

The proposal is inclusive of all
ethnicities and states the minimum
commiu-ncnt necessary for the cola
lege to attain iLs goal of a trueliberal

We wish to emphasize that the
coalition also includes ASIA, which

Mike Kent Flap: Pure Fluff

 

To the Editor:

By now, the whole hippie harass—
mentissue has grown quite stale and
has left a bad taste in the mouths of
all. From the onset of Students
Against Hippies to the harassment
charges,counter-charges. the sensa-
tionalist journalism of The Scarlet
and Black and finally a Judicial
Council hearing, this whole event
couldberegardedasthelargestpiece
of intellectual fluff encountered by
the campus this year.

It is odd that the focus of this hear-
ing was the intent of Mike Kent’s
display of his Spot the Wonder Dog
posrer, not the outcome of it. Based
on Judicial Council’s decision, are
we then to assume that sexual come-
ons and slanderous racial remarks
made "jokingly" will not be per-
ceived by the college as harassment
of those who are offended or who
feel threatened?

It is surprising thatJudicial Coun<
oil or any college structure can conv
done Mike Kent's actions or legiti-
mize the existence of his organiza-
tion. Students Against Hippies is by
nature an aggression against certain
members of the community, as is

indicated by its name. ”Students
Against Hippies" connows an or-
ganization of people opposed to the
existenceof another groupof people,
not the ideologies or actions of such.
It is obvious from the list of pro-
posed activitics of the organization
that one of its basic premises is to
revel in violence.

It is ludicrous to think that Mike
Kent’s posters can berationalized as
“unusual” for the intent ofatcracting
“closet conservatives." If a conser-
vative is “in the closet“ because he
does not desire to be someone that
everybody makes fun of, he is cer-
tainly not going to ally himself with
Mike Kent’s organization in an ef-
{ontolosethe“conservativestigma."

It is a shame that the one thing
Mike Kent’s organization will ac-
complish, ifanything, is the damag-
ing of alegitimateconservative view-
point. He seems to be oblivious of
the fact that radical conservatism is
no more productive or rational than
radical liberalism. It is also a shame
that the college docs not recognize
his actions for what they are 7
malicious.
