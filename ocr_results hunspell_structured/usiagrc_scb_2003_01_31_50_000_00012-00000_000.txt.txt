Coming back to college

Former non—traditional Student Judy Garland ‘00 provided a unique perspective in dramatically
different classrooms when she started studying art and education again after a few years off

Here's what Lloyd said about his
stuff: 1) ”The impenal War Museum in
London is extraordinarily difﬁcult to
ﬁnd. Tube stations Surround it, but all
the arrows to it are wrong. That was
really annoying, so I used a map." 2)
”These are pens that I accidentally
stole from the bookstore. I don’t feel
like returning them berause I gave
them 3300 of my parenls' hard earned
money, I stole $150 worth of parts by
decident, but] don't feel bad about it.
