Edwards turns down
the heat on Clinton

BY DAVID H. MONTGOMERY

John Edwards's speech lastTuesday was nee
table not for what he said, but what he didn't say,
The third»place Democrat and ﬁrcbrand did not
mention Hillary CIinrotL

Well, Edwards brought sen. Clinton up once,
during the question and answer session after his
speech, to politely mention that the New York
senatoi had Voted for the Senate resolution
declaring the Iranian Narioiial Guard a terrorist
group. “She’s entitled to her vote," Edwards said,
“1 Just strongly disagree with it."A critique, yes,
but for the candidate who had been leading the
anti-Clinton charge for the past

several weeks, including on nation- News Analy5ls

ally televised debates,itwas striking
in its mildness.

Edwards also did not use the opportunity of
his visit to Grinnell College to critique Clinton’s
campaign for dishonesty. It was a Grinnell stil—
dent, Muriel GallorChasanoE’lo, who created
national news when she told the S697? that the
Clinton campaign had given her a planted ques-
tion to ask Clinton at a Newton event. Edwards
helped fan the story by mentioning it in his
speeches, and his campaign even put up a tem
porilry website called “Plants for Hillary" to draw
attention to the issue.

But standing on Griiuiell's campus, the angry
man of the Democratic race did not draw the
comparison He did not make an oblique refer
once, even when talking about how much he
valued Iowa democracy and students’ questions.

This rip-tocing around Clinton was even
more notable given that Edwards had plenty of
angry words to go around President Bush, the
Republicans, lobbyists, drug companies, special
interests and multi-national corporations all came
in for theirsharc ofpopulistrachuton Clinton,
Edwards was silent,

Moreover, after the event, reporters asked
Edwards whether his comments on a lack ofrrust
in politicians were meant to imply that Clinton
was untrustworthy He said no, and attacked Presis
dent Bush for "dcstroylingl the trust relationship

between America and its president." -

This is a standard Edwards talking point.
In the Nov. 15 CNN debate, he attacked Bush
for this, and said that because of that destroyed
trust, “there are fair questions to be asked of all
ofus, including Senator Clinton." From there, he
launched into criticisms of Clinton for double-
talking on important issues. For about a month,
this kind ofattack from Edwards on Clinton was
commonplace, At one point, he even suggested
that he might not support Clinton should she win
the nomination, (Edwards later said he would.)

So what 1in behind the newly docile John Eds
wards viseaevis Hillary Clinton?

One factor might be a poll
released the day before Edwards’s
speech, That poll had good news for anyone
opposed to Clinton's candidacy: the New York
senator, once a front-runner in the statc.was now
trailing Illinois senator Barack Ohama (though
technically in a statistical tie) in Iowa.

But Clinton's support hadn't fallen. Obilmd's
had gone up, and his increase in support appeared
to have been at Edwards's expense.

Iowa voters have been famously averse to
mudslinging campaigns. In 2004, the then-
statewide frontrunners Howard Dean and Dick
Gephardt engaged in a plercaucus exchange of
negative ads~and then came in third and fourth
respectively, behind Sens, John Kerry and Ed—
wards himself (who was then noted for running
a relentlessly positive campaign).

So maybe Edwards has toned down the per»
sonal attacks because he thinks that they were
hurting him more than they helped him. or
maybe the fact that suddenly Clinton is no longer

the Iowa frontsrunner makes her a less pressing ,

target. (Itwasn’tjust a ﬂukegother commentators
have noticed the same thing over the past week.)
Or pcrhaps the Edwards campaign planned all
along to go positive in the last month before the
caucuses

Regardless ofwhy Edwards has changed his
rone, it clearly marks a new phase in his campaign.
By Jan. 4. we'll know ifit is a winning strategy.

ls noontime
the best time?

Edwards noontime event runs long,
raises questions about event scheduling

\BYABHY RAPOPORT

Last Tuesday, many students were eager to hear former Sen,
John Edwards answer their questions. Unfortunately, For many
to do this, they had to miss class, as the event did not end until
around 2 pm.

Technically no campus event may be held during class time.
But the “noonshout” time slot piesents a sticky area in school
policy Loosely deﬁned as between noon and 1:15, technically an
available time, it presents trouble when events like the Edwards
rally go too long and force students to choose between rhe talk
and their class,

Rachel Ely, Director of Conference opeiations, organizes the
events and logi s “I said multiple times to them, ‘Hcre's your
window,"'shc sa

Bly is the ﬁrst person to work with campaigns and other cam-
pus events, arranging logi ical detai .Whilc Bly olgaliizcs the
event with the campaign, she alerts Barb Trish, Political Science,
to the CVCHL Trish is the faculty administrator of the Program in

Practical Political Educarion (PPPE) and must approve speakeis .

and events.

Neithchrish nor Bly expected the tvenr to go as long is it did.
“I was not pleased when I heard how late it \vcnt,"said Trish. ’

Bly said the noontimc events used to work when campaign
steps were smaller oi-deals. “It used to be they stood up on campus
and shook some hands and asked some questions,"she said “They
are full—ﬂedged productions now,"

Earlier in the semester the Clinton campaign brought and
eleine Albright to Grinncll, but scheduling conﬂicts prevented
her from being allowed to speak on campus, Accolding to Ely,
Conference operations worked with the campaign to try to ﬁnd
a time that worked.

While ultimately they could not ﬁnd a satisfactory time.Trish
and Bly both offered the Clinton campaign the noontime slot.
When the Edwards campaign came forward, both Trish and Bly
felt obligated to oﬂer the same spot.

But according Bly and Trish, the Edwards campaign will no
longer be welcome during the noontime slot. While the time slot
will still be open to other nominees this year, its {me next election
cycle is uncertain.

”We may rethink whether or not we do noon events for the
next elecrien cycle," said Ely.

Trish noted, “It’s really not a great slot."

Dori smith,chairinan ofthe Poweshick Democrats, rhinks that
campaigns generally overrate the advantages of having events on
campus. “They probably prefer to be on the campus because they
think it will get them a biggei crowd," he said. “I think they’re to
a degree mistaken on that and I will tell them so."

According to Smith, campaigns lose townspeople when events
aie on campus because ofthe lack ofparking at the Rosenﬁeld Cen~
tei.'ihis is particularly signiﬁcant this year, because while students
may be more likely to volunteer, they are far less likely to caucus.

“Grinnell College student turnout is going to be sharply lower
than in previous years because of the timing," Smith said.
