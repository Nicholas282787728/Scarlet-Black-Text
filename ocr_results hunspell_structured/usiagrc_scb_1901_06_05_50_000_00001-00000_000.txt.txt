It is pleasant to record that in
the contest held by the lowa So-
ciety of the Colonial Dames of
America, the prize was awarded
to an Iowa College student. This
distinction belongs to Mr. D. G.
McCarty becauseofthe excellence
of his paper on the “Early Social
and Religious Experiments in
Iowa." Consideringtheopportune
ityfor research work which we
have here as compared with that
in other places, such as the State
University and the colleges of
Des Moines, Mr. McCarty's suc-
cess is deserving of most cordial
Congratulations.

abeth Barrett Browning and Lew-

The Hill Prizes are Doubled.

The Hill prizes are designed to
be an incentive' to extemporane»
otls wori all through the college
year. Each speaker carries into
any contcstjust as much discipline
as he has earlier gained. There
is no such thing as extemporane-
ous acquisition. It is :obvious
that agreater incentive to more
painstaking and thorough society
work would be most welcome.
Iowa college must build up arepe
utation tor training good debaters.
Flonl the academy work on, the
members of the literary societies
should look forward to the time
when they can contest for these
prizes, The opportunity is ever
before them, and all that can be
asked is a fair ﬁeld and no- favor.

To make the prizes more ota
consideration, to whet the ambi-
tion, and it possible, to create an
interest clear back in the society
life, all the Hill prizes will be
doubled in amounts this year, It
is hoped that it will no longer be
possible to wait until commence-
ment dlaws near, before the stu-
dents begin to think of entering
these contests. Pleparations
should begin much ,further back.
Almost allthe good mental gitts
fall into line in a contest of this
kind.

Futhcrmore the donors of these
prizes have been considerate ot
the fact that now and then a slur
dent would be assisted ﬁnancially
by the winning of one of these
contests, and that in this way the
reward ot merit would be put to
good use in straightening out He
nancial difﬁculties. In interviews
the donors have said that the ex~
cellence of the work donein these
contests has been highly satisfac-
tory, and lt is their hope that, by
increasing the prizes, a still high-

er standard may be attained.

The Hobo Picni

The “hoboes” of the Junior
class. who in this instance come
prised the entire class, held torth
last Saturday in a way that .will
long be remembered by all. As
soon as the plans ot the social
committee became known the
successof the picnic was assured.
The reality exceeded the anticie
pation. About four o’clock the
hoboes began straggling in trom
all directions to the place of
meeting on the campus, and in
a short timea motley crowd or

“weary Willies" had assembled. ‘

Afterawaitof an hour or so,
during which several interesting
pictures were taken and an excite
ing smash-up or one or the hobo
carriages occurred,the class start-
ed tor the picnic grounds south
west or town. The pleasures of
the trip can better be imagined
than described, Although the
principal equipage was drawn by
tour horses, walkingwasthe order
or the day, and the class was
ready tor the bountiful supper
which was served by the social
committee soon atter the arrival
at the grounds. Atter playing
some or the usual games and sing
ing around the camp ﬁre the

homeward journey was begun and
by thetime tacalty hours were
reached all were home—a tired
but happy lot orhoboes.

Deadbeats or Not?

The ﬁnal issue of the Uni! will
appear the last part of the week,
and will be torwarded totllosesub-
scribers who may have lett Grin-
nell at that time. The )une issue
will complete the usual eight num-
bers. It was hoped by the board
that there might be a ninth issue,
but the state of the ﬁnances for-
bade. It is astonishing to ﬁnd
how many deadbeats there are in
school. Fully halt or those who
have allowed their names to re»
main on the subscription list
throughout the year, try to slink
out of the dollar and a quarter
which in all tairness they owe.
Some say'that they signed no con-
tract. Perhaps not. but their con-
duct in continually receiving the
Um'lin silence and then refusing
to pay is no more nor less than
the mothodlot a deadbeat.

In most things a college student
is eminently fair and the rule

 

should not be reversed when the
time comes to pay tor a college

ing money out of the Uni]. In
fact hc will this year lose forty or
ﬁfty dollars because the students,
usually so loyal in college entere
prises, retuse to pay their just
debts. If you don't wish to get
the reputation ot a skinﬂint, seek
out the business manager, or at
least don’t sneak off when you see
him approach.
