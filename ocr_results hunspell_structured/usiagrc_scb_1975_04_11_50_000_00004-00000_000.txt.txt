(‘iltbacks in the Complex are
costing Grinncll College two ex-
t-cllcnt equipment managers
known as Bill and Les One man
uns given a like Job, The other
was uttered a x to ll shitt in the
Complex “hich he turned down On
hlonday uiternoon a iew athletes
walked into the Complex to find
new doors being built and our
equipment managers laced with a
change in employment. Why? And
who's going to take their place?

Mike Nadalsky made a comment
of, “I’ve been in Iootball several
years and I don't feel l‘m qualified
to take care oi football equipment
and repairs.” Mike's ieelings are
similar to the otherathlete’s views.
Who’s going to repair and take
care oi the equipment? Students,
who don’t know anything about
equipment? Retired men, out oi
practice? Who's going to wait in
the Complex until 3 am ior the
iootball team to get back irom a
road trip so they can sort out the
equipment and have everything
washed? “Mose” Killian, the other
equipment manager, can't do all
this by himseii.

i never see those guys doing
nothing, It they're not washing
clothes, putting the athlete's gym
clothes in respective lockers ior
the next day’s practice. they'll be
tightening rackets or other odd
jobs. How much money do the
people who are behind this think
will be saved? The experience and
knowledge of Bill, Les, and Mose
will allow them to do a better jobin
a‘ shorter 'ar'rioi'int ‘ oi time , than
someone else, If they are going to
be moved to 581G or another time
shiit, they will still have to be paid
out oi college money and the
student or other help in the
Complex will also have to be paid
out oi college money. We are also
concerned about the riprotfs of
sweatsuits, shirts, shoes, etc. that
will occur with students running
the “cage” instead of Bill and Les.

The way I see it, it will cost the
college more in the long run

When the athletes heard that Bill
and Les were not going to work in
that cage we were up In arms. We
want them in there, A petition at
the North Campus dinner Tuesday
night drew 95 names, mainly oi
athletes who know the amount of
work and the quality done by Bill
and Les, On top of all this, the
athletes were never even asked an
opinion of the matter. What we
want now is some kind of a forum
with Dean Walker, Torn Latimer,
the athletes, John Pfitsch, and
whoever else is behind this
decision so We can find out the
exact situation.

To the Editor:

I understand that the college is
terminating its employment oi Les
Hildebrand and Bill Lippincott as
of May 19 at the P.E. Complex, and
replacing them with part-time
student help to save money. I’m
sure the savings realized will
probably only be enought to wine
and dine the trustees and alumni
this inauguration weekend,

The economic issue is not so
important; it is the issue oi college
responsibility that concerns me.
These two men have done excellent
work ior the last seven years at
Grinnell College. Both depend on
the college for their livelihood and
probably cannot get employment
elsewhere, Les arid Bill are friends
to every athlete, and'are really
integral parts at every college
athletic team. But for the sake of
some (not much) lousy money,
they are not deemed ”ex-
pendable.” Les and Bill have done
a lot tor the college, and the college
should now return the layer by
keeping them in the Complex jobs,
I urge everyone to cooperate with
current student efforts on behalf of
Les and Bill.

 

 

 

 

Africa
forgotten

To the Editor-

The ExecutiVC Council Minutes
of February 19 informed us “ . . .
that given the importance of
modern Europe, it was the area
most lacking in their (the history
departmcnt’s) curriculum”. As a
result, the history department has
recommended that the position in
modern European and African
history be redefined as tivesixths
Europe and one~sixth African. As it
is, the department presently offers
30 courses on U.S. and European
history out of a total of about 50
courses, We recognize that next
year the history department will
lose one oi its European
professors, and that there are
problems in creating a well-
roundeol history department at a
slnall college. We are questioning
tho department's solution to its
problems as symptomatic of a
larger problem.

In many ways, the history
department at Grinnell relleets the
ethnocentric perspective
characteristic of America as a
whole. This is reflected in the
prevalent attitude among both
students and faculty that in order
to really understand the world we
must first know the West lEurope
and the U.S.). It is this attitude
which leads Americans to ignore
the importance oi non-Western
nations. We can see the serious
consequences oi this as much oi
American foreign policy falls
apart, flawed by a basic misunr
derstanding oi the problems we are
involved in,

We are striving ior an un-
derstanding of the world. Courses
are needed that will help us unr
derstand the rising nationalism of
Latim America, Africa, and Asia.
We would like to learn about the
present crisis in the Middle East
and its historical background. We
cannot know the problems of the
world by studying strictly the
West. Nor can we learn this
through the iew survey courses
oiiered on many non-Western
areas, (e.g., all oi Airican history
in one easy semester). perhaps if
the department would offer
courses on these important issues,
the enrollment in non-Western
courses would rise, There are
students who are interested in
these areas who are not interested

in the college's oiierings.

We have lelt it necessary to
protest the ethnocentricism at
Grinnell as seen in the history
department. We should hope to an
institution such as Grinnell leading
to n new world consciousness
among the students, Finally, we
invite other members oi the
campus community who have
iound the same problem, as well as
those with criticism, to make their
views known, Howard Cohen

cluster
system

To the Editor:

Like all other Grinnell students, I
can't help myseli irom noticing
this distinct turbulence that is
always present on campus. Outside
oi the usual small cliques and
social groups thatnormally’exist in
a college community, there are two
distinct groups of Students that are
remarkably separated in virtually
cvery way. The entire Grinncli
community is forced to face the
fact that the school is divided into
two sections, the Black students
and the White students,

There is really no doubt that
Blacks have undergone unv
believable persecution in the past.
There is no doubt that such perr
secution still exists today, The
problems between the Whites and
Blacks are incredible, but they are
not unsolvabie. Forced integration
is not the answer to such problems,
but neither is the Black Cluster
system. The cluster system is not
the cause oi the problems, it is an
effect.

If a sampling were taken at the
Grinnell student body, the results
would probably not be en-
couraging, Most Blacks seem very
content being together, and many
Whites, feeling that the Blacks are
not hurting anyone, do not object to
this separation.

I believe that to be an error that
is in desperate need of correction.
We are all being hurt badly by the
separation. with such a
separation, there is no, or virtually
no communication between us. So
many good Black ideas are never
even approaching White minds and
so many good white ideas will
never reach Black minds. Because

or this, we cannot begin to unr
dorstand each other, only adding to
the coniuslon and compounding the
bitterness between US. As time
goes on, we grow further and
iui-ther apart Eventually, it may
be impossible for us to over
reconcile our differences. Some
believe lhat we are already beyond
the point of settling the many
racial problems, i do not.

The lirst thing that we must do to
attack these problems is to
reestablish serious communication
between the Blacks and Whites.
Communication is the essential
element ior any change to occur.
And without change, there is no
hope of ever progressing
anywhere. I believe that We can
communicate our ideas to each
other without the arrogance and
condesconsion that typiiies the
attitudes oi the present. Many may
ieel that peaceful communication
is an absurdly idealistic and
unrealistic solution. With men 01‘
the past like Mahatma Gandhi and
Martin Luther King, I iind it dit-
ficult to believe that peace is ob-
solete.

Many people may wonder what
good it would do to attempt to
change Grinnell if the world
remains the same and as vicious as
it has been. I‘m only one man
writing a letter to a small
newspaper. but the truth is that
everything must start somewhere.
At this point, anything is helpiul, a
one-to-one discussion, a letter in
reply, an open iorum, a iormal
debate, or any other iorm of
constructive communication. I
welcome any type oi possible reply
to this letter, even it it only acts to
create a mild shadow of true
communication.

What has to be done requires a
great deal oi eiiort and many years
to accomplish. True, it will take a
long time, but nothing will happen
in ten ,iimes ten thousand years if

we continue as we are.

Editor’s NotHFewer clusters
are blocked this year than in the
past. Clark, Younkers. and Loose
llalls will have clusters which in
total will house lit uppcrclassmen,
The reduction in participation is
attributable to black students
either going on oil campus
programs. living on campus, or
going through regular room draw.
