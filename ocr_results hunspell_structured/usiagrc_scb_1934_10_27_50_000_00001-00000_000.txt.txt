Indians Down
Pioneers 3-0

on Field Goal

Grinnell
Fail Upon Reaching

Offensive Drives

Scoring Territory

Despite having chanua after chance
to score in the opening half oi the
game, Grinnell once more bowed down
,in defeat last night as the Haskell
indians rung up a 3.0 win.

Visions of a victory day appeared to
the Grinnell students as Pioneer drives
in the iirst quarter brought the ball
up to the Zﬂsyard line twice and to
the 25.yard stripe on another occas—
ion. They were practically ready to
start the celebration when Kingery
sped to the lndians’12ryard mark in
the second Stanza; but the three points
gained by a Haskell field goal iinally
proved the margin of vicwry.

. improvement Shown

A much improved Crinnell team
was exhibited last night, and though
lack of coordination in the pinches
cost it the game, the prospect oi gain.
ing that long sought win before the
end oi the season appeared much
brighter than heiore.

The iirst period was almost allGrin-
nell, with the Pioneers gaining at will
until they entered Scoring territory. At
that point the Pioneer oiiense invar.
iably broke down and three successive
scoring chances were lost.

Haskell Makes nick‘

Following the repeated Crinncll
drives, Haskell started one of its own
which sé’emed goal—line bound, but
with the ball inside their 20.yard line,
the Pioneers braced and the Braves
were forced to kick. Summers re.
placed Falleai in the lineup and pro.
ceeded to piace.kick the ball directly
between the uprights ior the winning
points.

Soon aiter the Braves had counted
Kingery got loose on his long run, car.
rying the ball fromthe Grinnell 48.
yard line for a distance of 40 yards be.
iore being iorced out of bounds by the
Haskell safety man.

nimble Costs Chance

On the next line play a iumble by
Grinnell resulted in a large loss, and
the three succeeding plays gained Little
or no yardage.

The remainder of the first half and
most of the second were played on
iairly even terms, The ball was kept
in the middle of the field must oi
the time, superior punting by the in-
dians keeping Grinnell out of dang.
erous territory.

Second Drive Started

Near the end of the game Haskell
began another sustained march
down the field. The tired Gn'nnell
team seemed unable to stop the hard.
driving indian hacks and once more
the ball was carried to Grinnell’s 12.
yard line. AIS-yard penalty on the
Braves gave the Pioneers their chance
to stave off a second score. Taking ad.

periormed duties planned to keep
members of other hulls awake.

Free dogs barking at a captive goat
and captive dogs barking because they
weren't free added to the headaches
of those who were worrying about the
presence of an outbuilding unceremon—
iously dumped at Clark hall’s door
last night.

Casualties were many, but minor.
nouse officers assigned special treas.
ure hunt duties with care last night
after several freshmen spent part or
the day in bed due to over.cxertion in
the setting—up exercises. other cases
were “hushed up" by house mothers

'.l\vo blocked kicks and a fumble
spelled defeat for the Grinnell year.
lings in their game with Mason City

tr) take the small and of a 25-12 Score.

Despite their defeat, however, the
Pioneer irosh showed up well, con.
slderingthc fact that the game was
their [list test under fire. Lack of
perfect coordination was still evident,
hut prospects were shown that a
stlong prep eleven may bc developed
before the season ends.

Make Us: bl Breaks

The iunior collegians gained an ear.
ly start, taking advantage oi breaks
to score twice in the opening period.
The first touchdown followed recovery
oi a blocked Crinnell punt on tho
16~yarr1 line,

The Second came as a result of
another bad break for the Grinnell
outfit. While attempting to evade the
rolling ball after a kick by Mason
City, the Grinnell safety mail was
hit by the pigskin when it took an
odd bounce. Mason City recovered
on the ail-yard line and went over
irom there on a pass and a plunge by
Suter, the J. C. captain.

' J. C. Scorer Again

A third score was rung up by
Mason City in the second quarter on
a series oi passes and running plays,
bringing the Score to 19.9 at halls
time.

In the second half Giixlnell began
to click with an aerial attack. A
30—yard heave by Preston Evans which
Bill Sampson gathered in and carried
l‘m‘ another 25 yards brought the iilst
tally ior the Pioneer yearlings.

Light.Wciglus Score

Later, with the light—weight clcvcn
on the field, Grinnell scored again
by the same method. This time Mau—
rice Kelly was on the hurling end of
a 20—yard toss to Ricky Boller who
carried the hall, the remaining Short
distance to the goal line.

The winners ended their scoring by
capitalizing on a third Grinnell error.
Aiter blocking a Pioneer kick, a
Mason City man captured the loose
ball and ran unmolested over the
Grinnell goal line.

Promising Talent Displayed

A good deal of promising talent was
uncovered in the freshman outiit dur—
ing the course of the game. In the
backfield, Clow's plunging and Schlot-
,terback’st. running were ouotanding
wllile both Evans and Kelly Showed
possibilities oi developing into valu.
able passers.

In the line Osborne, Spence, Witt.
lock and Woodward all stood out,
while Hayward’s performance at the
end was probably the most outstand.

Years oi adventure, exploration and

descent into the sea. He has explored
extensively jungle—lands in every part

The climax of his under—sea ad.
ventures camc this summer when, on
