Comp lit loses Members

(continued from page 5)

slant » an average of 13 for
each of five classes. The pro-
blem is one of faculty losses
due to a drop in language re-
gistrations. Because Comp Lit
draws on the faculty of these
departments, their losses are
a serious problem for it. Be
parting language instructors
are not being replaced either
because of lack of demand or
— more significantly - lack of
money.

”We can't be sure at this
time of the comp lit. program
din stay together," said Brian
Harris. Jon Hall is the only
man who has comp lit cre-
dentials, and he is leaving.
The inter~department prog-
ram suffers as a result. Some
new hiring may occur, and
it may be good for comp lit.
We have to pick up what we
can get.

"There’s always the hope of
becoming a department, but
of course we can’texpectany-
thing like that with the present
financial situation. Comp lit
has proven itself to be viable.
I would say the student inter-
est is increasing. It has its
problems and it also has its

positive as lects. I m not pes-
simistic. 'm just waiting to

/ see what happens.”

English department enroll-
ments are holding to past aV’
erages except for increases in
Shakespeare, and Major Brit»

. ish Poets and Narrative. Fac-
. ulty membersnextyearwillbe
those currently in the depart-
ment; Edward Foster will re-
turn from leave. Future plans
include more general courses
for nonrmajors. Four meet—
ings have already been held
about such courses, but no
decisions have yet been made.

First year French enroll~

, ments held steady this semes-
ter, but the bottom has dropped
out of the secondyearclasses.
‘The department is losing one
fulltime and one part time in-
structor next year. Still, there
are plans for new courses.
Still in the early stages of
planning are first year course
in linguistics, and two new
upper level courses discus-
sing various genres of French
literature. Student involve-
ment is high. They are con-
sulted about faculty job appli-
cants, course offerings, and
comprehensives (which were
retained).

German experienced large
losses in secondryear enroll?
ment. F. Andrew Brown said
the department is meeting to
work on new courses but “has

« no plans up our sleeves at the
moment" for dealing with the
drop. There are eight majors
who participate in the usual
EPC meetings. Presently th-
ere are four professors of-

. fering eight classes with an
average enrollment ofnine per
class. Next year the faculty

, will drop by one when Charles
Ayres leaves to attend law
school. ‘

Russian, with 39 students, is
the smallest department ill the
college. Part of its small size
is due to the listing of16 Rus-
sian students as comp. lit.
students. The department has
not been affected by dropped
requirements; no one was ever
foolish enough to take Russian
merely to fill a language re~
quirement. Dennis Whelan re-
ported that the change hasnea
vertheless prompted some re-
thinking of courses.

The depart-ment expects to
remain at least at its present
strength because upper- level
courses are currently strong.
For example, there are more
second year students in Rus-
sian than in French. The de—
partment has always mtered
to the interests ofnon-majors
opening most classes to peo-
ple who do not read the lang-
uage. Reflecting the general
education interests that lack of
requirements should create,
the department may offer Rus-
sian culture survey courses
in the future.

The Spanish department has

two ﬁaculty members, offers.

six courses, and has about 12
majors this year. Fourth semi
ester Spanish has more stud‘
ents than any other fourth
semester language course on
campus. Beth Noble said that
the dropping of requirements
will free the department to
offer more courses for gen—
eral students. (he develop-
ment of thisarea is the expec-
ted addition ofa professor to
teach Latin American history
or perhaps general Latin Am<
erican thought. Next year Sp-
anish will also give a fresh-
man tutorial.

Student involvement is high
in the department. Because it
is small relationships can be
very personal. For two years
majors and staff have met
regularly in a Spanish Forum
to discuss departmental is-
sues and college issues in
general.

ber of students enrolled9 in
sociology courses, Goldberg
Said,

“There are certainly per-
sonal attitudes involved which
i really couldn‘t speak to. My
own feeling is that we’ve got
one of the most substantial
small departments in the
country. I really don‘t have
an explanation for the low
enrollment in our depart
ment."

The PoliticalScience depart-
ment, with five teachers and
18 courses this semester, is
offering five fewer courses
than last semester. Average
class size is about 24 stud‘
ents, and the department has
experienced less demand for
introductory courses ‘this
semester than was expected.

Instructor James Hottois
said that although one section
of Intro was cut this semes*
ter, enrollment there is still
up comparedwithsecondsem-
ester last year.

The department is losingas—
sistant professors William
Daly and Neal Milner next
year, while professor C. Ed-
win Gilmore is retumingfrom
leave. Thus, unless one addir
tional teacher is hired (which
Hottois says is a possibility),
the department will have four
teachers next year, a drop of
one. When asked whether the
number of profs in the depart-
ment is sufficient, Hottois ree
plied, "Of course not. We
wanted to keep Mr. Daly very
badly.”

The department is presently
worrying about 65 to 70
majors. Concerning majors
and course planning, Hottois
said, “We want to at least
review senior yearprograms,
and will talk to those majors
on the EPC‘s." He noted that
meetings with all majors,,in
the department have never
been very productive in the
past, largely because somany
failed to attend.

yHOttois also neted some sh~
ifts in types of courses that
students are taking in the de-
partment. He said that there
was a big swing into the Am-
erican systems and process
courses first semester, and
that there was some drop in
the comparative politics cour-
ses. l-le cautioned against ins
terpreting this as a long-term
trend, however. Because
course offerings depend lar-
gely on the specialties of the
personnel, the uncertaintyalr
out neXt year’s staff makes it
impossible to say exactly what
will be offered.

The Economics department,
although reporting very little
shift in total enrollment from
last semester, has exper-
ienced drops from the usual
number of enrollments in its
introductory courses. Prof-
essor James Hamilton, chair
man of the department, said
that it is his impression that
any course entitled "intro"is
bound to lose enrollment.

Next year the department will
remain at its present staff
level of four teachers, with
Steven Gold leaving and Mr.
Dawson returning. This sem-
ester the four teachers have
a tatal of 11 classes averagr
ing 17 students per class. Hat
milton reports about 35 def
clared majors at the present
time.

Hamilton was vague concerns
ing possible changes in course
offerings for next year. He
said that the department is
considering many changes,
but that “they're little more
than ideas at the moment.”
He said that his department
"hasn't been hit drastically
by the end of requirements--
at least yet," and that he as
sumes the number of majors
will remain about. constant.

Phys Ed Registration Surprises Pfiisclt

‘There's more people in the
program this semester than I
expected," asserts John
Pﬂtsch, professor of physical
edumtion. "We had a bad
start because the decisions
on credits weren't made until
the day of registration."

There are about 200 students
taking phys ed classes this
semester, compared to about
300 last semester under the
phys ed requirement. With
the debut of the new phys ed
complex scheduled for next
fall, registration should re
turn to the old levels.

Students have generally Sig
ned up for the less traditional
courses, Pfitschnoted. Dance,

imming enrollments are way
up, while golf and tennis are
both down.

The credit situation is as
follows: a student may earn
a total of 12 credits in phys
ed toward graduation, with a
maximum of eight in course
work and four in a combinas
tion ofvarsityathletics and/or
interest groups. Credits are
awarded at the level of 1/2
credit per semester hour.

Pfitsch said that he expected
the announced $12,000 cut in
the phys ed budget to come
primarily out oftravel, equip-
ment and supplies. He hopes

that there will be sufficient

programs will be lost. Golf
and skiing program adjust-
ments might be made to save
money, and the department is

ing programs.

No staff cutbacks are plans

Anthropology“ departs -

ter. The three man staff tea-
ches nine courses, with an
average class size of 25 stud-
ents.

Professor Ronald J. Kurtz,
chairman of the department,
said there are presentlyabout
25 majors in the department.
Last semester about 100 studs
ents took the introductory an-
thropology course, while this
semester about 85 are enrolls
ed in the three sections. Kurtz
said that this latter figure
compares favorably with sec,
ond semester last year, and
commented, "If anything, the
dropping of requirements has
helped us.”

Kurtz, speaking of possible
changes in course offerings
due to dropping of require-
ments and increased enroll-
ment in the department, said
that the Anthropology depart-
ment has been studying a two-
semester basic sequence. The
plan calls for two lectures a
week to a presumably large
group, and smaller discussion
groups meeting once a week.
Depending on how much read
ing and how many testsa stud-
ent took, he could earn two,
four, six, or even eight cred‘
its in a semester.

Kurtz, although unsure whev
ther the EPC’s and Executive
Council will approve the plan,
said, "Personally, Ithinkthat
we're at a pointwhereweneed
to provide a variety of offer-
ings and pedagogical styles."
He feels that the flexible plan
outlined above would beaposr
sible beginning.

Kurtz commented that the

plan could conceivably be stafs
fed with the present three'man
department, but conceded that
senior majors might be called
upon to help with the discus-
sion groups.
