Tire Minneapolis Syiirbplrouy 0r-
chestra, which is to he heard at the

tiiat it is tiic only one oi the great
American orcliesti- s which has grown
to ar rc maturity under the con-
_diictoi- wlio iorirred it, and still cori-
tinuos under- his baton. Emil Ober-
liolter has been the conductor oi the
Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra
iroin its inception tour-teen year-s ago,
and the rrnprcccdentcd development
oi this orchestra irorir its beginning
to its present position as one oi the
greatest symphonic bodies in the
world, is due largely to his genius,
tact, and magnetic personality

Mr. operholicr comes ii-orn a musi-
cal iarriily and was horn in Mririicli.
Me has had‘a wide musical experience
as an operatic, choral and orchestral
conductor. and has been in this
country ahorit twenty years. oper-
hoffci' has been called by a prominent
cr ic l“AmCl‘iCa'S poet-conductor,”
and trrrc it is tiiat while his interprev
tationsare ririie and vivid as occa—
sion may require, he has that rare
iaculty oi weaving a spell over his
audiences by reason oi his power oi
bringing out the inner poetic spirit
or the works oi the masters oi music.
It is tl s iacuity oi losing the minds
hotly oi musicians that make up his
orchestra iiito rvlrat may he called a
wonder-tally eloquent instrument, that
has placed him among tiic recognized
great conductors oi the world, and
has rvon ior the Minneapolis Sym-
phony Orchestra its position as one
oi America's three greatest orches-
tras. This recognition has come to
.\Il'. Obei'hoffei' and his remarkable
orchestra wherever they have ap—
peared, and public, critics and run
ciaiis have vied with eacii other
eirtliu merit,

The loyalty ot Minneapolis to the
orchestra aird Mr. operlmltcr is re-
tlectcd iii the subscription tor a term
oi years oi an annual guarantee oi
$75,000, which has errahled the man—
ageincut to bring to rire orchestra the
ﬁnest artists ironr the world's music
cciite .- and to briiid up an art.tio
personnel unsurpassed hy that oi any
orchestra in the country.

it is inter-c his to note the unani-
mity with which the leading critics
aird niiisic ’tlls oi the East have ac-
corded to the. Minneapolis Symphony
orchestra its position as one oi the
two or three greatest oi-enesti- s in
the country. Charles H. Meltzer, con-
sidered by many the most able e he
in New York, wrote as follows: ' t
i siiie to ,say that with the excep ’
oi the great Bostonian organization
rounded by Col li irson. no hotly; oi
musicians iir this country wliieii do»
votes itscli to symphony, has excelled
the Minneapolis society. But. ior local
pride, 1 might be tempted to add—
none ha equaled it." The Musical
chin-ici- aid editorially: “Let it he,
said at once that the visit oi the iii—l
neapolrs Symphony oi-chc, i-a has irri-
ﬁlled the Mrrsicai Courier prophecy.
ior ivc have today in New York no
playing body and no leader on a par-
with the Northwestern organization
arid its condrictor.

“During the past iive year no or»
cho, la in the country has traveled
more extensively, and thc success oi
oi the orchestra and its remarkable
(olltltlctor, Emil Oberhort . has been.
little less than sensational.

by Colic t- t‘liirir,

Schumann‘s cantata, "I’ﬂl‘ﬂdlse and
the Peri," is one oi the m t cllcllnlllr
ing musical poems iii . stonco. it
was Schumann’s ﬁrst work ior chorus,
and remains his greatest and iriosi
important in that held. As a choral
writer Schumann is less well known
than as'orie oi the great masters oi
nianoiorte and song writing, brrt in
this worlt he reveals the poweriirl
ability oi mutating ttie widest pos-
sible range oi poetic expression
tirrorrgh the medium oi massed voices
as is character 'c oi hissongs and
pieces ioi- the piariotoi-tc. In “Para-
dise and the Pei-i," based on Thomas
Moore‘s poem or Lalla Rooitli. Schn-
mann round a text olieriiig almost
every phase oi emotion, and the result
is a masterpiece which grows in
beauty as [mic goes on.

"Paradise and the Peri" has never
been given in Griniiell heiore. As a
matter at iaet, it belongs to the more
dimeult type oi choral works, both
as to solo and chorus parts, and can
be given property only by a highly
trained body oi Singers, The srrpe or
proﬁciency oi the College Choir is
iuiiy adequate to tire requirements oi
this work, and with the a--stauce ot
a group oi distinguished soloists thc
ereiit may well bc anticipated as one
oi rare enjuynlent.

Tire soloists ior this occasion will
he Marie Kaiser, soprano; nose Llltia
gcr Gannon, coiiti-aito; ltuliy Holder,
tenor, and Royal Dadum, baritone,
The work will be directed by George

the Sunday afternoon cantata will be
taken lry bliss Rnhy Holder of the

Gannon, of Chicago, Mi s Holder's
beautiful voice and per-feet artistry
have been striking features oi this
