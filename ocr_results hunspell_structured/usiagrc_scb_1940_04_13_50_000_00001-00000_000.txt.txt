Rabbi Kertzer Point‘s Out Seven Major
Gifts of fudai'sm to Modern Culture

Comparing civilization to a sym—
phony with its diversity of in-
struments and variety of tone:,
Rabbi Morris Kertzer, associate
professor of religion of Iowa
university, pointed out seven ma:
jor contributions of Judaism to
modern culture in Herrick chapel
last night, Rabbi Kertzer was a
special guest of the Y. M. c, A.

The goal of culture is unity,
Kertzer said, adding that in west
ern civilization people no longer
look upon it from two opposing
sides~my side and the wrong
one—but rather as a harmonious

blending of elements.

To bring out the Jewish ele-
ment in the whole, he compared
it to a tapestry whose intricate
design consists of many strands
and groups of strands, many of
which are Jewish factorseboth as
individuals and as a. group.

Among the leading Jewish fac»
tors, according to Kertzer, are
contributions dating from Biblical
times to the concept of democra—
cy and liberty, to moral law, to
family life, to medicine and
science, to literature and art, to
education, and to citizenship.

questions to draw him out.

corridors of ARI-I or about the
administration building, always
walk with your head down as if
in deep thought, pondering some
weighty problems in math or phil-
osophy, for instance. This is
highly recommended to get on the
