initiatives

custodial schedules

sponsored by Michael Andersen

Because there are more important things in life
than erriciency, the student body urges
Facilities Management to maintain its
traditional practice of assigning each residence
hall to an individual custodian rather than
moving the dorms to a "team-cleaning" system,
We also ask that the college cease its year-old
policy of shifting these jobs into a 4 a.m.-—
12:30 p.m. shirt. These new policies, opposed
by many custodial staff, would assign
custodians undesirable hours, putting especially
unreasonable demands on staff members with
young children. They would furthermore
undermine Grinnell's unique dorm community
by interienng with studentestaff relationships
and removing both the students' and the staff's
sense or shared responsibility tor the places in
which they live and work.

no war With iraq '

sponsored by the Grinneil Anti—war Alliance

The Grinnell College Student Body, in solidarity
with other colleges and universities, including
the University or iowa, is opposed to the use or
military rorce in iraq by the United States. We
support efforts by the United States to pursue
diplomatic means to disarm Iraq or its most
destructive weapons in collaboration with the
united Nations. We encourage effective
weapons inspections coupled with the gradual
lifting of sanctions on Iraq. We do not support
the following actions by the u.s. government: a
pre-emptive attack on Iraq, the current
sporadic bombing campaigns within iraq,
unilateral military action in Iraq, or u.s.
participation in military achon against Iraq
without demonstration that Iraq poses an
imminent threat. We advocate a peaceful
resolution of the conflict with Iraq.

self-governance

sponsored by Michael Andersen

The policy of self-governance being perhaps the
single most unique characteristic of Grinnell
College, I, as a member of the student body,
afﬁrm my commitment to its ideals and my
understanding of the burden it places upon
each of us. As a believer in the worth of all
human beings and the potential of Individuals
to shape a just and happy society through
discourse rather than punitive enforcement, I
personally pledge to respect my peers and their
opinions and, whenever possible, to seek to
resolve conflicts without reliance upon external
authority. I likewise pledge to care for the
well-being of those around me and always to
consider not only my own selisinterest, but the
ways in which my actions influence my
community.

In making this pledge, I voice my
opposition to proposals being discussed by
some members of the student government
which would attempt to codify and ”enforce"
adherence to the principles of self-governance.

free hot water

sponsored by Devan MoGranahan

This initiative calls for the free distribution or
hot water at the Forum Grill to customers who
provide their own container. The_results will
serve as a quantiﬁcation or the students who
desire such a service on this campus. If passed,
this initiative will provide evidence supporting
the argument for iree hot water when it is
presented to the appropriate administrators,

the initiative. Your vote
counts toward the 1/2

Abstaln

registen'ng an opinion. Your
vote counts toward the 1/2
ot the campus voting but
not the 2/3 needed to
approve. It's runctionally
like voting “no.”

Voting on student
initiatives will take place
next Tuesday via the
Blackboard system on
the internet. In order for
an initiative to pass, half
the student body needs
to vote, and of those
votes, two-thirds need to
be in favor.

more support for dance

sponsored by Nazli Eginlioglu,
Sophie Walker and Shira Pagan

More spaces for dance instruction or practice
should be created as soon as possible,
especially within the framework of the plans for
the new Student Center and the new Physical
Education Complex. The program should
especially have a more extensive and advanced
offering of performance and technique based
dance classes such as ballet, African dance,
Jail dance or Latin Dance. The program should
make an effort to offer classes of a broader
cultural spectrum. Furthermore, the dance
program in Grinnell College should evolve so
that it will offer a deeper curriculum. The
curn'culum Should ieach an advanced level in
each dance form that it offers: there should be
more than just two semesters of training in a
single type or dance. There should be more
introductory course sections each semester.
More dance instructors should be employed by
the college. The Theater department should
create more opportunities for students to work
with faculty in dance performance and in other
dance related areas.

dorm labs needed

sponsored by Alejandro Oyarzabal and the
Student Academic Computing Committee

We, the students of Grinnell, recognize that
dorm labs are still a necessity for students, and
accordingly request that IT: place at least two
24~hour dorm labs on East Campus and one in
Gates Pit using the VMCA’s computers. The
other dorm labs should be preserved.

Present,
Not Voting

signiﬁes that you looked at
the ballot but aren't voting.
Your vote doesn't count
toward the 1/2 of the
campus voting nor the 2/3
needed to approve. It’s
functionally like not voting.

vote on
Blackboard

Just the basics:

1) go to Blackboard,
http://
blackboardgrinnelledu
anytime next Tuesday,
that means midnight to
midnight.

Z) log-in. Remember
that your Blackboard
password isn’t necessarily
the same as your regular
webmail/NT storage
password. (more on that
later)

3) Click on.SGA Election
link on the bottom right
hand corner of the
”Welcome” window.

I.) Vote.

What if I’ve never
used Blackboard

before?

This is where it gets a
little more tricky, Your
Blackboard password
isn’t the same as your
regular Webmait/NT
storage password. If
you’re not a ﬁrst year or
a transfer student, until
you change it, your
password for Blackboard
is automatically set for
the last seven digits of
your ID number including
some of those leading
zeros. However, if you I
are a firsteyear or a
transfer student, until
you change it, your
password is the number
after you drop all the
leading zeros. All of
them.

I don’t get it.
Who can help

me?

For help logging into to
Blackboard or with the
ballot itself, contact Liz
Allan, SGA administrative
coordinator at’x4310 or
the Help Desk at X4400.
The Help Desk is only
open until 10.

Where I can I get
full text of the
initiatives?

They're available on the
585’s website at
www.glinnell.edu/sandb,
They will also be
available on Blackboard

with the initiatives on
election day,
