Softball reigns supreme

by Paul Schwartz

“This 1M Softball season has to
be one at the best turnouts in IM
sports ever,” said Owen Hall, Chief
Coordinator of IM activities.

There are 18 teams competing in
this spring's annual slowpitch
competitions, with over 200
Grinncll students who have signed
away about rive hours worth of
their studying time per week in
order to partake in the softball
games. “Considering how many
teams there are and all of the
games that have been played in
just one Week,” said Hall, “it’s
amazing that there's only been one

torieit in this season so far. Even
though you‘re allowed to field ten
men at a time, many teams have
had to have a iew players sit and
alternate in order to pla at all."

PROBABLY THE best ex»
planation tor the increase in suits
ball activity lies in the sunny
weather. The side lines at most of
the games have been lined with
students. interested in soaking up
sun and enjoying a softball game.

As is typical oi any large group
of Grinnell students. the 18 teams
reflect a diverse number at per-
sonalities. There are the “hard
care" teams which will show up at
least a half an hour before game
time in full gear, trom spikes to
baseball caps. in order to warm up
for the competition. On the other

 

C94:-

side oi the ﬁeld, which is more
often in the home team's dugout,
are the “druggie” teams which
will prepare for each game with a
method of training that is best

enjoyed while reclining near a
stereo,

MOST TEAMS PLAY a brand of
ball that allows for maximum
pleasure, however, playing the
game to win but never leaving
their beer cans at a distance of
more than three feet from where
they are standing

“The weather is definitely
helping this season's turnout,"
Hall concluded, “but there'd be
playing even in the snow as long as
there was postrgame justifir
Cation."

Women ’s soccer forming fast

by Paul Schwartz

After an unsuccessful attempt at
establishing regular practice
sessions {or women soccer players
in the fall, sophomore Lnralee
Newman has organized a women's
soccer club which has been
practicing on a daily basis for over
two weeks.

“Our biggest problem is to get
women that've played soccer for
some years." Newman said.
“Women‘s soccer is relatively new
in the United States, but We've got
iive players who have high school
experience.“

The club is not officially
recognized by the Grinnell Athletic

the squad is supplied with several
soccer balls.

Varsity soccer players have been
tilling in as coaches tor the team
thus tar. with Rich Fendler. Dave
Morote and John Higgins giving
their time and helping the club get

asked me ii i would coach them.”

He continued, saying, “It's been
kind oi iun so tar but there aren't
enough girls out to make~ two full
teams to practice.”

A total of 14 women are narr
ticipating. Newman said, but
players from the men's soccer
team have been helping out; they

Looking into the iuture or
women's soccer at Grinnell.
Newman said, “I hope to even

Holman said. “WC Could easily be
