Om: nighteach spring, torts loiigasalniost any.
one at Glmllcll can remember, a cluster of Grillnell
students have gathered in a campus lounge, tallted
for an houi-oi-so, passed around a basket orcandles,
and marched around campus and into town, singing
and chanting in an snort to illustrate the potency oi
their concern over the effects ofscmal assault on the
lives of men and women.

This year that all happened in the fall, too.

ment policy.

in recent years Grinnell has had an
unomeial policy to peg tuition at 90 pere
cent the averageotwhat our peers charge
to give its an advantage in the odmissions
game Faced with such a policy—unofﬁ»
cial though it may be—thc Board of
Trustees is debating two options,

Grinnell could ltecp comprehensive
fees static thns widening the gap between
the cost ofatmnding Grinncll and the cost
of attending peer collcgcs. This option
would provide some relief to students
whose family's ﬁnances have suffered in
the recent years.

With the second option Grinnell
would continue to adhere to the 90 per-
cent policy and increase tuition along
with our peers, using the extra revenue
to do big things, said Brandilikc In-
creasing faculty salaries, or contributing
to ptoieets in the stiategie plan.

Because of antirtrust laws, Grlnnell
will not know changes in peer institue
tions’ tuition before they are published
publicly, long after the board approves the
budget in February. This lack of infor—
mation means the steering committee cait
only speculate how much peer institu-
lluns might chonge the cost ortnitton

This immediate debate is framed by
the board oftrustees' longeietertn goal to
reduce dependence on the endowment as
a souiee of revenue Currently so pcrv
cent orcrinncll's operating budget comes
from its endowment. And Brand says the
trustees believe that sort ofievenue bal-
ance does not align with their goal to Free

tions “forcvcl.”

At this point any sort of tuition in.
