RF, pleasure in Itt‘rlloutlcc
ing the election at M .cs Mcr
Ewen and Knox and Mr Spattlr
(ling as members of the editorial
board.

Tilt: STATE University IS to be
heartily congratulated on the
victory 0[ their debaters over the
University or Chicago. They are
entitled to all the more credit from
the fact that individually and nuts
tediy they had wort-ed tarthiully
to make this a well earned victory.
The support given the debaters
by the entirt: school has been as
enthusiastic and as
that given to their athletic teams.
and the honor of tlie debater is as
highly regarded as that ot an ath»
lete. Grinnell students. and tac-
ulty as well, may with proﬁt emu»
late this spirit. and the opportu-
nrty tor so doing rs offered/117m.
The arrangements for the debate
with Cornell are completed and
the contest is assured, Our
standing in this Llepartmcntvof iii-
tercollegiate relations must be de»
terminecl by the attitude and spirit
of the college as a whole. as much
as it is in other lines. Three men
cannot credrtably represent the
college in debate it they do not
feel that they have back of them
the support of the entire school.
and that their fellow students are
tdking an interest in their eflorts
and expect to talcc pride in their
achievements. It is the college
which is represented, not a ten in-
dividuals, and encouiagcment and
support should not be Iet't to these
individuals to otter. Let every
student make an effort to l)l‘lng to
bear upon this contest the true
Grtnnell spirrt and we may conﬁ»
dently expect that the showing otl
our debaters will be in every way
creditable to thc college.

tended to the Michigan manage
merit an invitation to r-c-eirter the
contests. and it will probably be
accepted. Michigan withdrew
two year ago because two of her

and Michigan men are disposed
to view the present attitude of the
Madison men as tacit acknowledge
merit of the error of their former
positron.

At Harvard a change has been
inaugurated in the treatment of
students caught cheating in exam-
inations or written work of any
kind. To the old plan or punish

versity has been added the turthcr
disgrace or publishing the name
