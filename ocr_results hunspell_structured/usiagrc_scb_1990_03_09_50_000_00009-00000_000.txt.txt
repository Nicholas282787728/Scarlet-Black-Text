2"Frankly,
-My Dear

By Louise Alcom
and Elizabeth Banftcld

..,I don't give a damn!” One
of the most famous lines in all
' of movie history is bound to
chill Grinnell Viewers this
weekend when the films
‘ committee presents Gone With
the Wind, This 1939 stunning
cinema achievement was
produced by David Oi Selznick,
and in spite its concurrent
release in the same year as The
Wizard of 02, it swept the 1939
Academy Awards in every major
category except Best Actor. an
omission that has since been
disputed.

The story is based on
Margaret Mitchell‘s epic novel
and involvu the lives of upper-
class Southerners before, during,
and after the American Civil
War. The film stars Vivien
Leigh as Scarlett O’Hara. the

beautiful and temperamental
heroine, and Clark Gable plays
the dashing Rhett Butler, who
delivers that fateful line as he
leaves Scarlett forever.
Throughout the movie, Scarlett
transforms from spoiled
southem-belle to a woman
forced to pick her own cotton
ﬁeld to save her beloved "Tara,"
the family farm. The twisting
relations between characters over
the good times and the bad
times truly relays the old
axiom. “all‘s fair in love and
war."

With its stunning portrayal
of the historical and cultural
effects of the Civil War, Gone
With the Wind is a “must see"
for everyone. While the movie
is quite long, it remains both a
poignant portrayal of the
changes of the American South
and a treasure of cinematography
history.

Toontown Hits inWho Framed Roger Rabbit

By Jennifer Mattes

“Mum-dimensional
interactive character generation"
was the label quickly applied to
Who Framed Roger Rabbit
upon its initial release two
summers ago. People had to
call it something. The ﬂuid
interaction of cartoons with
people in a film had never been
achieved to this extent before.

Bob Hoskins is an
unemployed private detective in
a ﬁctitious Hollywood sprawl of
1940s Los Angeles. a place
where animated “toons” work
for film studios and maintain an
uneasy coexistence with real
people. He is assigned by a
cartoon mogul to protect toon
star Roger Rabbit, who is
mistakenly accused of murder.
A vintage 1940s mystery plot
ensues, as Hoskins and the

perpetually goofy rabbit dodge
cartoon bullets and a pack of
animated weascls commandeered
by the typically manic
Christopher Lloyd.

The entire film is a
frenetically paced sequence of
action, in which the glistening
detail of exaggerated cartoon
surfaces is fully integrated with
the reality of the actors This
effect is attributable to the work
of animation director Richard
Williams. His technical effects
are detailed to the extent that the
ﬁlm merits a second viewing to
fully appreciate them.

But the real highlight of the
ﬁlm is Bob Hoskins. He is the
most underrated actor working
in ﬁlm today, If it Weren't for
the fact that most Academy
members are disconnected and
senile denizens of Orange
County who fail to even watch
the movies they vote for,

 

 

Examining
Personal
Freedoms

Leonard Nimoy reveals his
talent as a director in his
sensitive film, The Good
Mother. Based on the best
selling novel by Sue Miller, the
film stars Diane Keaton as a
recently divorced mother who
engages in a vicious custody
battle when her ex-husband
appears on the scene to accuse
Keaton and her live-in lover of
neglect and abuse of their
daughter. Nimoy gives this
sensitive subject matter an
intelligent direction that
emphasises that there are no
easy answers.

Hoskins would have received a
best Actor Oscar for this film.
The degree to which he
effectively acts against air is
amazing. Shambling about
with the wrinkled raincoat and
hard-boiled city accent of an
archetypal “ﬁlm noir” detective,
he brings into reality the teens
that surround him and make his
life miserable, Thcir non-stop
hilarity transforms him into a
boiling powder keg of palpable
irritability. He constantly
lunges and snatches at their
fluid, inaccessible forrrts, only
barely managing to befriend the
one he is assigned to protect.
The inherent incompatibility of
humans and teens is made clear
during Hoskins‘ harrowing
interlude in Toontown, the LA
suburb inhabited exlusively by
studio contract toons.

This section of the film also
serves as an homage to the

entire history of Hollywood
film animation. The classic
cartoon characters of Warner
Brothers and Disney converge in
inane harmony in Toonlown,
and they also periodically pop
up elsewhere throughout the
film. The old cartoons were
painstakingly recreated to look
as they were in the 1940s, and
director Robert Zemeckis
thereby acknowledges that his
film is an indebted end product
of thateta.

The consequent technical
credits at Roger Rabbit’s
conclusion keep on rolling and
rolling. The amount of effort
put into this 45 million dollar
film is unbelievable, but the
summer box ofﬁce rcvcnue that
quickly propelled the movie into
the black is not. It affirms the
fact that an engrossing
distraction is well-paid for in an
escapist culture.

Murray's Lunacy Roan—Ls

"I hate to advocate weird
chemicals. alcohol, violence or
insanity to anyone“. but they've
always worked for for me."
These are the wise words of
the notorious Dr. Hunter S.
Thompson played by Bill
Murray in Universal Picture's
zany movie. Where the Buffalo
Roam. The preACnddyi-hack
Murray portrays the free-
whccling journalist Dr. Hunter

S. Thompson with his late
civil libertarian defense attorney
Karl Lazio, played by Peter
Boyle. This comedy is set in
the late sixties and, according to
“Cue” magazine, has an
“irreverent lunacy...the latest
entry in what is fast becoming a
minigenre-latc 1960‘s
nostalgia.” The movie also stars
Bruno Kirby and features music
by Neil Young.
