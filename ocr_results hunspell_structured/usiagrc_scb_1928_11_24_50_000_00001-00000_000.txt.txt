BLUEJAY CAPTAIN IS STAR

First Quartet Proves Fatal For
Pioneers When Creighton

A pair of star linemen, one a red-
hair-ed demon, a captain playing his
last game for his Alma Mater and the
other, a darkrlhatched slim youth

swept across the darkening Ward
field Friday afternoon and the scar-
iet~tonped captain of the Pioneers,
Charles Fail of Des Moines, came off
second1 best, the score being 20 to 19,
but it was no fault of his.

Grinnell lost the breaks, and it was
just these, or the mar n of the alert
playing of Sam Caniglia thatthe game
was lost. For the spectators the game
resolved itself into a battlc of stars

tackles and appearing master“ of the

cases their husky leader was on the

and crashing forward.

Fatal First Quarter

Grinnell lost the game in the first
quarter on a tough break. Tire first
play was a fumble. recovered by one
of the Creighton forwards and the
rest of the first quarter was spent
battling at the goal line. After being
repulsed twice the Bluejays carried
the oval over and made the kick, Ari~
other touchdown was on the Creighr
ton side of the score board before
the Pioneers even started to play real
football and the count was 14 to i),
but from that time on the Pioneers
had a clear nrargin as far as actrral
football yardage could be counted.

Wisconsin Journalism Head Talks
Before Press Delegates At
Chapel Last Night.

PRESENT PAPERS BEST YET

Greater Press Lemdership May Be
Obtained Through Educating
Public Ayers Bleyer.

By ‘Jlnu s Galleghcr
(Grinnell orange and Black).

(This story was awarded first

prize in the contest in newswrit-

iug which was one of the features
of the press convention which
closed today.)

“Newspapers of today are giving
their readers what they want and
yet are constantly cr- icized [or sen-
sationalism. Whether the worth-
while topics of the day will gain
prominence in the newspaper of to»
morrow will depend on the youth of
todaymthe journalists and public 3f
the next generation. This was the
statement of Prof. Willard G. Bley—
cr, director of journalism at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin, in his speech
on "The Newspaper of Tomorrow" at
Her-rick chapel Friday evening.

Despite deserved cr- ism, the
newspaper of today is the best of all
times, the speaker pointed out. Tile
advertisements are more truthful,
the editor ls are better, more for—
clgn news is included and less sensfi»
tional news published than formerly.
n democratic government largely tier
pends upon public opinion and' more
than any other factor in American
life does the newspaper mould such
public opinion, besides influencing
our home life profoundly.

Prof, Bleyer pointcd out five
changes in the development of civiln
izationi ation in the last forty years
which irave been the roots of the
changes in our newspape during
this period. Thesc wer : the in—
creasing use of machiner standard—
izaliorl of products, increase in mass
production, the shifting of the popnr
lntion to the cities and general speedy
ing up of brisiness and home life, All
arc influencing the newspaper of to.
day, as they will that of tomorrow.

"While today the newspaper tends
to he more a commercial than jour-
nalistic enter-prise, competing with
the movies, radio and the auto as
means of amusement, the newspaper
can acquire a position of supplying
public opinion with ‘l‘ood for thought'
if the journalists of tomorrow will
it so,” declared the speaker. “Heavy
reading holds little place for the tired
busincs srnnn of today. but this situ-
ation will tend to become less the
case as machinery continues to sub-
tract from his working hours and
adds to his leisure."

That high school journalists
should conscientiously prepare them-
selves for a journalistic career if
such was their goal was urged by
Professor Bleyer in Conclusion. In
preparation for such a career, he
suggested that the opportunities af-
forded by the courses in journalism
foullrl‘ in our high schools and coin
lcge be taken advantage of, instead
of the young journalist relying on
an “apprenticeship” in a newspaper
office, the only means of gaining ex—
periencc in former" years.

izntion of the’ necessity of a. complete
break with the past, the deadening
influence of the Church, the material-
istic philosophy and economic deter—
minism and the hostility of the church
and its priesthood [0 the revolution

olution in religion.

Mr. strong emphasized that the

marked that the only help we can
