Accreditation report

should he read

Who are the Grinnell students? What do we want from
Grinnell? Does the curriculum reﬂect our needs? 15 the
curriculum suited to today’s world, or is it outmoded? Does
the “liberal arts tradition" need to bevreassessed?

These are all pretty hefty questions, worth discussing and
thinking about, They are all questions that were raised by
the evaluation team for the North Central Association of
Colleges and Schools in its recent accreditation report on
Grinnell.

UNFOKTUNATELY, THE value of these questions tends
to be obscured by the nature of most of the report. It is hard
to take seriously such observations as, “At one randomly
chosen lunch hour in the Forum, every student was eating
’while studying (or studying while eatingl." This was offered
as evidence that Grinnell students study too much, although
it could just as easily be taken to mean that Grinnellians are
big eaters. '

The report is full of little gems like that. Its depiction of
the humanities at Grinnell as “tight little islands” is merely
ridiculous, but when it goes on to Comment that"‘the Waters
(may soon) reach the neck, the chin, the nostrils,” it turns
into the ridiculously sublime. The authors don’t stop there,
but instead decide to mix in another metaphori“Cotton is
not king on the Grinnell Island, the departmenti ”

ASIDE FROM BEING generally poorly written, in many
cases the report cites insufficient evidence to back up its
conclusions. The team was on campus a mere two days.

All of which do not, needless to say, go very far toward
supporting the report's conclusions. Some of the conclusions,
indeed, must be read through twiceiand slowlyibefore the
meaning sinks in. In the section on Grinnell’s students, the
report reveals that science students are considered by most
of the campus community to be more intellectual than other
students, but that on the whole, the level of intellectualism
at Grinnell is not too highialthough the students do study
an awful lot. Students show a “lack of animated con~
versation about intellectual subjects," yet “as a group they
are highly intelligent, vigorous. and full of life. One need
only walk across the campus to observe their animated,
intelligent expressions and energetic manners,” the report
gushes. No doubt the students are animatedly talking about
what they are going to eat for lunch at the Forum.

BUT DESPITE THE report’s shortcomings, it does raise
some interesting and controversial points. It tackles the
touchy problem of faculty tenure, saying that tension is
created between faculty and administration over tenure and
this has a debilitating effect on the college.

Itcharges that the curriculum is too conservative, that “a
clearer approach to broad social problems seems relevant."
The curriculum is directed toward preparing students for
graduate school, says the report. and should broaden its
goals. The “liberal arts tradition” that Grinnell operates
under should be revised for twentieth century needs, it adds.

THE REPORT ALSO criticizes the Grinnell students for
not pursuing the issue of curricular conservativism. “The
Grinnell student does not appear to be an activist. . .Yet, if
the inclination toward activism were there, the conservative
curriculum would be an obvious target."

Faculty tenure, the educational goals of the college, and
student involvement in curricular matters are important
issues that deserve general campus discussion. The concept
of liberal arts is one that deserves constant re-evaluation.
The report, flawed though it is, is a stimulating critique of

, Grinnell. Copies of the report are on reserve in the library; we
urge all members of the campus community to read it.
