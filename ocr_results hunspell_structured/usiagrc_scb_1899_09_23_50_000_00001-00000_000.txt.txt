On Wednesday evening Grins

ing of the year, under most favor ,

in the hall was occupied, and the
speakers, instead of being greeta
ed by the usual monotonous per
spective ofempty chairs, experi-
enced the novelty of confronting
a large and tlltentite audrencc.
which inspired them to their very
best efforts. In fact, the whole
program is deserving or
commendation. Those who tool:
par-t showed that they had
thought over what they wished to
say, and manifested an ability to
put their thoughts into good Engs
lish ivhich was an excellent illuss
tration of the value of society
work.

The meeting was called to or
der by chaplain Otis who instals
led the new ofﬁcers. Mt. Halsey,
the new president, then delivered
his inaugural address which was
listened to with close attention by
the society. He laid special
stress on the two main atlvzllitr
ages derived trom society work;
the ﬁrst, the purely practical ad
vantage which comes trom spear
ing and debate; the second, no
less important, the good fellows
ship which prevails in good socie
ety, where all class distinctions
are abolished, and the
members meet on the same loote
ing and tor the same purpose,

Mr. Macartney then rendered a
very pleasing vocal solo and re»
ponded to an encore.

Mr. Stevens was next with a
paper in which he compared the
public men of England and Am-
erica, and incidentally the condi-
tions which produce these men,
comparing the broader culture
and strength of the English with
the nervous tension and strain
which characterizes American
life.

The rest at the program was
made up. of short speeches, in
which various departments of
college activity were taken up,
and an effort was made to induce
the students to take a deeper in-
terest in those that are somewhat
neglected.

Mr. Davis came ﬁrst with an
address dealing directly with
Grinnell Institute, pointing out

Men's Bible Classes.

Perhaps a word in addition to
the iotnial notices of the men’s
Bible classes may not be out of
place tosucli as arc still unfamiliar
with the proposed program. First
of all, in regard to the separation
of the men and women in this des
pnrtrnent of the Association work;
it should be understood that the
change in no wise means a mis-
understanding or opposition pol-
icy, birt was undertaken purely
rrrth a view to satisfying the desire
and, as it seemed, the best inter-
ests of the men and women les-
pectively, the latter preferring by
tt decided majority the system of
student leaders.

The Bible study committee ior
men has arranged a program at
cotlises which it believes no man
in college can airord to ignore,
whether he be a protessing Chris-
tian or not, the classes are for
him, for his orvn enlargement of
lite, his own equipment in a line
of study of the greatest import-
ance and one which in the nature
or thrngs the college crrrrreulnm
cannot adequately otter.

A word in detail: The senior
its coulsc under l’rol.
Simmons, will undertake a study
or the teachings or Jesus based
upon the gospels and directed
particularly to the deeper doc-
trllial and pirrlosoplricai aspects of
his ministry I’rof. Simmons ex-
pccts to devote a great deal ot
time to the presentation of the
course and the committee feels
that it need do little more than
announce the class to insure a
large attendance among the sens
tors. The class meets in room 25,
Chicago Hall.

Tliejtiniors will have a specially
valuable course to look iotivaid to
in Prof. Parker's presentation of
Jewish history and polrties vieued
in the light or their preparation or
the world for Christianity, the de-
velopment of thc monotheistic
idea of God, and other allied
topics, It was with some effort
that Prof, Parker was sccul'cd for
