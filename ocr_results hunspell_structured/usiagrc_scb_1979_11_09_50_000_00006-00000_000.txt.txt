Vandalism problem frustrates combative efforts

by John Mandel -

Both thefts and vandalism continue
to plague the campus and ”are very
frustrating for students and the ad-
ministration because there is so little
that can be done," said Jim Teder—
man, dean of students.

Although no outbreak of campus
thefLs similar to those last year has
occurred, break-ins have happened
this semester in a number of halls, in»
cluding Norris. where several tools us-
ed for construction purposes were
stolen. Langan Hall has also suffered
a number of break-ins. There, no
severe vandalism was discovered, yet
Tederman said the administration is
concerned because it is in the midst of
renovation and mechanical systems
may pose a hazard for anyone who
breaks in.

Unoccupied Mears Hall has been a
favorite target of break-ins. A number
of lamps and their timers have been
stolen or vandalized. It the hall is re-
tained rather than razed, some areas,
such as the parlor, are true antiques
and cannot be replaced.

Younker Hall had a number of theft
problems onjhird floor, prior to fall

break, in which money and stereo
tapes were stolen. However, no thefts
have taken place since break. One
theft was averted in Clark Hall when
the night watchman deterred a thief
who was trying to steal the television
set. Nobody was apprehended in that
incident, however, said Tederman,

“One of the times when we always
have more thefts is right before break
periods; students should lock their
doors," warned Tederman. Those
types of thefts involving money occur
every year, he added. Tederman em-
phasized that if students have an item
stolen, they should report it to the or-
fice of Student Affairs. Also, the Grin-
nell Police Department should be
notified if valuable items, such as
stereos, are stolen, since many
students are insured under their
parents' policy. A police report is
needed for insurance companies to
process the claim.

One method used to deter non»
students from entering dorms during
finals last year was a 24—hour lockup.
Presently soudl campus 10 gia doors
are not locked because of e many
windows and doors that were broken
to gain entrance. This loggia is the
most constantly vandalized, stated
Tederman, as illustrated by an abun-
dance oi torn screens and broken
wood pieces.

In terms of security, new metal
doors are replacing older wooden ones
that contract and swell, causing pro-
blems in locking and unlocking them.
However, stressed Tederman, ”We
can’t control who goes in the hallinot
if we’re going to have 24»hour access
by all studenm to the hall.”

One measure that was abandoned in
the earlier part of the decade was the
buzzer system. At that time, in-
dividual room keys did not fit dorm
doors, and after a specilled time
students rang a buzzer to summon a
student on duty to open the door. The
tremendous waste of money and the
fact that students blocked open the

doors caused the discontinuance of
this system.

As for major vandalism problems
within the dorms themselves, the
situation, with a few exceptions, “is
not as bad as it has been in the past,”
according to Tederman, More damage
has taken place in older dorms than
renovated ones~except for a number
of Ceiling panels which have been
knocked out in the renovated dorms.
Tederman sees no way in which this
problem can be resolved since
mechancial systems such as wiring
must be run through me space be-.
tween the original ceiling and the false
one.

Tederman pointed out that three or
four years ago a new and expensive
carpet was installed in Loose Lounge.
Since then, it has been marred badly
by many cigarette burns, indicating
an ”outright disregard for property,”
he remarked. Additionally, furnishings
within common areas of dorms have
been broken, but because many are
old and in poor condition, he attributes
it to “normal wear and tear.” Another
headache has been me driving of cars
over lawns on campus, resulting in
stretches of ripped and rutted zuri.

A valid concern voiced by many
students is that the drywall used in
dorm renovations to cover the plaster
walls that have been destroyed is not
holding up. Tederman said the drywall
is used because, during the construc- ’
tion process, major portions of the
original plaster were taken out. The
primary problem is not only the cost
of plaster as opposed to drywall, but
one of maintenance costs—broken or
cracked plaster cannot be as easily
replaced because plastering is a dif-
ficult art and few plasterers are
available, noted Tederman.

“Regardless, we’re trying to use as
much plaster as we can because we
realize drywall just doesn't hold up as
well. if it is at all possible, we will re
tain original plaster in hallway areas,
starting with Smith Hall‘,” he said.
