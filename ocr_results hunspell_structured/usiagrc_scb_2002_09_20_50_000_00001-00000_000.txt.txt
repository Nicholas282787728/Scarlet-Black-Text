ITS switches from Boise to

by Vashti Davis
Staff Writer ,

When students returned to the oomputerlabs this tall,
many were surprised to see new paper sracltcd beside all or
the printers. immediately, Karen McRitchic, an ITS team
leader, was ﬂooded with phone calls wanting to know the
reasoning behind switching paper companies, “We didn't
change to IBM paper.” McRrrchie responded.

As it turns out the IBM paper in many of the com.
puter labs this tail was actually a result otrinding a case or
the paper in storage. “I didn't see any point in throwing it
away," McRitchie added, so she promptly distributed it
throughout campus.

Gunnell is, however, buying its paper somewhere hcw:

This paper r t McRitchie is currently buying, through
the Recycled producis purchasing Cooperative, is 30 per

FTP members were not yet completely satisﬁed with
the move to Willamette, however.

“They're essentially the seme to us," said Dieter ‘03, a
member of ms endegered rarest subgroup, though he
added that erlamcrte's environmental sins had been less

Some activists said the move to Willamette represented

movc, though, would also require a lot orcheriges around
