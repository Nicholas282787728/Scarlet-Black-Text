‘ What DO YOU Think? “‘Chappie” Writes of Experiences
As Teacher And Coach In China

(Continued from Page Two) 1
and I think it gained thereby. Bernard
Craven handled the role well on the
theory adopted for the part for this
presentation. 1 found nothing to criti-
cize in Miss Parker’s portrayal of the
socially-ambitious maid Etta. in the
pertormnnce of her household duties.
she certainly measured up to the most
approved social practice. Her efforts
at sell-improvement, especially as ex-
hibited in the scene with Geoffrey,

~ were exceedingly amusing.

Roderick White and veronica Duane,
played by Robert Berry and Agnes
Birdsall, were delightful young people,
nrodern and up to the minute, yet with
depths of seriousness readily appar—
ent. The Nancy White ot Katherine
Gilmore was a wonderful achievement.
Nothing is harder than tor a young
woman to no convincing as a person
t‘wicc‘ her own age. yct Miss Gilmore
accomplished just that result. Her
scenes with Roderick made one forget
.for the moment that he was not over
hearing the quiet 'conlidences of a
mother and her son. Difficult. too,
was the task of Emil Bilhztl'z to pre'
sent adequately nlaitland White, a
man of forty. He succeeded to a mark-
cd degree. his voice and inflection be-
ing especially good. Ralph Hall as
's. T. Warren, a live business exc-
cutive, completed a good cast.

The stage settings were very pleas—
ing, equal in every way (0 the profes
sional production of this play. The
costuming was charming and appro-
priate, additional evidences of the care
Mrs. Flanagan always bestows on her
work. ’

One final suggestion in closing. Why
not let the Dramatic Club repeat this
fine drama next Commencement in
lieu of a Senior play. Members or.
the graduating class have enough to
do at that time without attempting to
put on a drama. Frequently a class
will not have adequate talent. This
proctice ot insisting on a Senior Play
has resulted in the past in some very

mediocre perfomancesfor the week“ to school here a full yedr for $60 Mex. cause leow you will all laugh when‘

Following an eventful trip to Chlmt,
Forrest Chapman, '24, is having an inn
teresting experience in adjusting him-
self to his work as a teacher in Porter
school, part of Gl'innell—in—China it:
chhow, China.

“Chuppie” and Laban monk,
with a group or American missionar-
ies Who landed at Shanghai August
29, discovered afterwards that they
had caught the next to the last train
that was allowed to run between
Shanghai and Nanking on account oi
the bandit war in China.

At Nanking, Chapman and lrlcak
were put in a compartment with a
Japanese honeymooning couple. “That
night,” he adds, “We httd come to the
bandit. region. A car was added to
our train which carried machine guns,
mounted, which could he turned on
both sides of the track. TWO huge
search lights were mounted on the top
of the train and were on the count
on both sides at the tl‘nclt."

Tehow is a fascinating place, Chair
man says, a city of adobe with more
than forty temples within the city will!
alone. "Our school is located about it
mile from the City wall. The campus,
including the Porter school for boys,
the ”\Vychoff school for girls, and the
Homes of the Americans, includes 42
acres and is entirely surrounded by a
brick wall or dyl , some six or seven

feet high.. All of the buildings are of
brick and are most attractive."

Binding of the feet is out: of the old
Chinese customs which still survives
in the district around Techow. ”If 2.
girl comes with bound reel. she must
unhilld them and soak them in warm
water twice to help them grow back
to normal shape. If it girl is too old
and the bones are too badly broken
they never get very large but they are
at least more comfortable."

Mr. Chapman deplol‘es the difficul-i

ties which many of the students en-
counter in their efforts to attend
school. "When we stop to think that
that most of us spend between $900
and $1000 gold to go to school at
Grinnell for one year and then remenr
her that these boys and girls can go

'24, ‘

tron as they are taught in these Midr
dlc schools. There were six boys in
the senior class last year here at For—
ter and ﬁve or them went on to‘ uni»
ve-sities. This year eight of the ten
seniors plan to go to some college or
university.

“We can't really tell how great the
inlluence of the education of even this
many boys will have on this region.
174 is barely a “drop in the bucket" or
3,000,000 in the region but when these
boys write in their themes about Chi-
nese wedding customs that it is very
toolish the way the Chinese marry off
their sons and daughters when they
are twelve and fourteen years or age
without letting the mhavc any part in
the decision, when they say at the end
of a theme on Chinese funeral cuse
toms:

'“And now, dear teachei, don't you
think we have many very foolish and
superstitious customs? We boys who
are getting an education think so and
hope we can show- our friends and par-
ents how bad for us many of our cus-
toms ore,‘ then I think some progress
is hcing made."

In speaking of his duties, he says:
"I have 23 hour-sot classes each week
and all is English except two hours of
geography and of course this is in
English. Then 1 have three hours of
English in the evening with the ﬁve
Chinese tcachers who are studying
English. They are quite advanced and
are a most interesting group.

“The boys have a Y. M. c. A., tour
literary societies, a glee club and are
interested in self-government. This
brings to mind the fact that 1 have had
to make four chapel talks already. 1
was quite worried about the first two
but alter that I didn't mind. You see
1 have to have an interpreter talk with
meithzlt is, I say about a paragraph
at a time and he then interprets in
Chinese. By request I talked on school
spirit the first time. The faculty then
gasked me to explain the Court and
;Senate at Grinnell for the next,,two
times. By request of students and
facility I talked about my trip the last
‘time and now I am through with that
job for six or seven weeks. A chapel
talk here is a bit longer than at Grille
hell and I’m quite sure no prof. at
Grinnell was ever quite as worried as
I was that first time."

“I hesitate to mention athletics be-

tion at commencement visitors Would (about $30 American gold standard) it you hear I am coaching out here.’Well,

is not be good sense to give them a
production which will show what
really being done in the drama by stu-
dents of Grinnell College?

ity but I have a few men whom I think
should carry away some honors. They
don't fully understand the psychology
of athletics as we know them in Amer-
ica and so are not so. [ftr ahead of me
that I can't teach thcin a few things.
il i can not them to train better on
the ﬁeld I will icol pretty good he-
causc there are no other things like
staying up fill night, smoking and too
much dating here. The boys are very
anvious to have a spirit like our Grin-
ncll spirit nnd have asked me to teach
them the Grinncll song in English.
They already use our Alumni Song
tune tor their Porter song in Chinese.
it always gives me a big tin-ill when I
hear those bays sing that old tune. it
even if the words are diilcrent and
sounds better than ever away out here
are in Chinese."

Mn Chapman is living on the com-
pound with Harold and Grace Waters
Matthews, ’16. They and the faculty
or the Porter school, which includes
twelve Chinese and three Americans,
havc entertained him several times at
a. genuine Chinese meal at sixteen
courses eaten with chopsticks He
says, “Everyone makes a great deal of
noise in eating. All eat train the bowl
in the center oi the tblc and bones
and refuse is spit on the floor for the
tlnss to clean up. I really liked most
or the food and didnt mind the nulls—
ual manners at all."

mentions In his letter, is teaching in
