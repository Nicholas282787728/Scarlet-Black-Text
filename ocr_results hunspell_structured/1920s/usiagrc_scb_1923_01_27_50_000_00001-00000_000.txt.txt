' MOVIE STARS REPORTED,
COMBleG AGAINST HAYS

pean Affairs.

What practically amounts to martial
law has been declared in the occupied 1
area on the Ruhr Valley, according to;
Associated Press dispatches. All ‘
cafes, hotels, theatres and cabarcts ,
were‘ closed at 10 o'clock last night,
German time. The French were con—
tinuing to make arrests in connection
with Thu sdav s rioting. About ,
twenty nationalist leaders were inn-A
prisoned driving the evening.

Germany now is in absolute default ‘
on all her reparation obligations and
will be afforded no assistance in the
nature of a moratorium to gain her
iinancial feet, acording to a decision
of the reparation commission. Also at,
the end of the present month the Ger» ‘
man government is to be called upon 5
forthwith to pay the allies the sum ct ]

half a billion gold marks on her de— A
layed reparation account.

Dusseldorf bears somewhat of the
aspect of a besieged city, with French
troops patrolling the streets in place ,
of the German police, who have left‘
their posts. Throughout the entire
Ruhr region the number of men on
strike in the coal mines and other in-
dustries is slowly but surely augment—
ing . The railroads are virtually idle,

, and traffic on the river has all but;
ceased, the only boats plying beingl
manned by the French.

REPORT THAT MOVIE STARS ARE l
COltiblNlNG AGAINST HAYS IS
“BUNK,"

“Storm warnings" from the west‘
coast movie colony and reports that
‘czer" Will H. Hays would abdicatc;
his throne as film director were chars
acterized as "hunk” in an official
smtement by a high official in the‘
American producers and distributors-
association, of which Hays is direc—
tor and which is composed of the
ilargest bodies in the United States.
This song of hadmony Comes at a
time when rumors that Hays will “re—
sign" are rife and reports of a fight
against the organization of which he
is head on the part of a combination
of Hollywood stars flicker ln from the
coast.

"I saw that report that pickford,
Fairbanks, Chaplin, Lloyd and Negri
were going to tight the so—cailed movie

game to Drake university on the Coli-
seum floor at Des Moines last Satur-
day night by a 25 to 17 count. After
leading during a large share of the
game Grinnell failed to maintain the
lead, and Drake's roughness gave
them the game. ,

From a standpoint of victory, the:
game leaves much-to be desired, ac-l
cording to 'Sec‘ Taylor, sporting c -
tor of the Des Moines Register. Ac-
cording to Taylor "the going was
stonny from the very first tip-oft.
With Drake behind, the Bulldog play-
ers did not take their medicine in
good grace and started roughing de-
liberately, especially in the rear of
the court. rrom that point it was a
rough and tumble affair with every-
thing allowed except deliberate ﬁght—
ing in the open with the dam, and so
it continued, the Pioneers at the ﬁnish
when the game was hopelessly lost
being just as viciously rough as the
Bulldogs had been earlier in the
game."

Tearing led in the open ﬁeld scor-
iiig, and was the most consistent man
on the floor. Gclvin played well, and
Whitehill showed up with his usual
good game at guard. The play of Win»
ter at guard, drew the attention of the
sport writers at the game. Playing
in the place of Capt, Ty Smith, who
was ill. be displayed a knowledge all
the game, and an ability to light, that
will land him a steady berth on the
varsity from now on.

Although the game in Des Moines
left much to be desired in the way of
sportsmanship, Grinneii hopes to even
up the count when the Bulldogs come
here on Feb. 5th. At this game there,
will be an effort made to have two
officials, with a close watch kept for
all fouls. Although this may slow
up the game. it will prevent a recur—
rence of such happenings as those at
Des Moineso last Saturday,

DOUGHERTY FOR

says New Court Will Be a Body
Representing All Men.

By hick Daugherty

The Strident Court as provided for
in the new Constitution for Men's
Government will insure to every man
on the campus a fair deal by an im-
partial body of representative and
responsible men. All the men oil the
Court. of which there are nine, are
elected by the men of the school, ﬁrst
by nomination, [lien followed by a.
general election.

This Court is intended to do away
with the evils of the old Oracle, its
irresponsibility, and unl'em‘esentfttive
Character; in fact, the purpose of the
lantern in drawing up such a plan
of government is merely to give ex—
pression to the deﬁnes and \vislle Ol‘

repeatedly asked for a reform in our
system of Men’s Government.

adopted the Court will be yours, sol-

weeks, and after being revised in a
banter-n meeting last Wednesday
evening it is now ready for prcseniz—
tion. The complete constitution will .
be found un‘ page three.
Yroﬁdcs for student Court.
A Student Court, consisting of nine
members elected by all the under-
graduate inen of the college, is the
main feature of the new constitution.
Two of these nine Court members are
to he juniors, and the constitution pro-
vides that they shall hold over as
members of the Court during the fol-
lowing ycar. This.Court is intended
to displace the old oracle, anti in ad-

takc in any and all offenses against
college rules and traditions that may
be committed by any man. The scope
of the power and influence of>the
Court, by the now constitution, is very
wide indeed. The Court may hold
either open or secret meetings at its
own discretion. One of the important
provisions is that any man refusing
to appear before the Court when cal-
led shaii be suspended from college
by the administration until he com-
plic‘s witth the request of the Court.
President Main promises his unqua ‘-
fied support of this provision, as well
as of the whole constitution.

The personnel of the Men's Senate
is changed somewhat by the new con-
situatlon, but its duties remain prac-
tically the same, although they are
outlined more (definitely than here-
tofore. it will consist of the house
chairman and one other man from
each dormitory hall, and six dornd<
to‘ry residents and four town residents
elected at large. This makes a total
membership of twenty-two instead of
the twentyrlour members of the Sen-
ate as at present.

To Hold immediate Election.

The constitution provided for the
regular election of Senate and Court
members for the following year dur-
ing the month of May. it the con—
stitution passes the mass meeting
Monday night, the chairman of the
meeting will proceed with nomlno<
tions for Senate and Court members
to hold office for the rest of this year.
Separate ballots will be provided for
the voting on both Senate and Court
members. After the nominations a
general election will be held within
one week after the meeting.

The procedure for nominations pros
vides that each man in the meeting
shall vote for exactly the number of
men to be elected. Twic‘c this num—
ber of men, receiving the highest vote,
shall be considered nominated. 1n_
the election, which is to he held in
the reading room during one whole
day, printed ballots will he provided
with the' list of nominees, and each
man will vote for the number of men
to be elected. Separate ballots will
be provided for both Senate and Court
members. All nominations are to be
by ballot.

Undcr this syste. ten members oft
the Senate and nine members of the
Court will be elected. Tour of the
ten Senate» members shall be town
l‘usideuts. Two of the nine Court
mambo , shall be juniors and the rest
seuio .

Richard Dougherty, '23, as president
of The Lantern, will act as chairman
of the mass meeting Monday night. it
is hoped that all men will read the
constitution and come to the meeting
prepared to vote "yes" or “no" on its
adoption. The constitution provides
that it must pass by a majority vote
before becoming effective. if there
are any questions to he asked about
the constitution Monday night, those
who are acquainted with it will on-
deavor to answer them.
