IV. N0. 53

Clarence Darrow, noted criminal lawyer and wii er,
has been removed from the Program ol the National
Conference of social work which is _to meet in Des
liloines May 11 to 18 just because Dr. A. D. McKinley.
president oi the Iowa branch oi that organization, decided
that Mr. Darrow is making fun of the Iowa (armer in
his article in the current VANITY FAIR.

With one oi so wide a reputation involved McKinlcy's
ideas have created a iuror and have been accorded much
newspaper comment. It is quite evident that. the doctor
has read Mr. Darruw's article because the same was
reprinted in the DES MOINES REGISTER or March 29.
but it is also noticeable that he has read into the article
a great deal of Earp-or else the proiessional gentleman
of Iowa has been sadly msiquoted by the newspapers.

The charges advanced ,by McKinley against the
eminent lawyer are that he writes or the lows farmer
as an ignorant and n hcwbiskei-ed individual whose wife
hits the pathetic habit of going-insane. That the? article

grants the Iowa iariucr no business ability seems to
"gripe" the social worker.

Tile title oi Ml'. Dnrrow's article is "What Is the
liutlcr With the 1‘ l‘lllel‘?" with it sl‘lbrlillc “An investi:
sation oi the iarinci s complaints and the government's
responsibility." Tile account is coldly analytical and
bluntly states iacts but the iacts seem to hurt Dr.
licliinlcy in a manner which has caused him to become
tho watchdog ot the Iowa iarnicr iroiu a social stand»
DOHIL

A parenthesis should be inserted here to thc ciiect
that although Dl'. \[cKluley has nut used the term "Iowa
Fr'll'mel'” he has said “tile articlo holds the best citizenry
oi iowu open to biiiioonory," and one is justiﬁed, it
would seem, in assuming that he meant thc luwa iarnicr,
as the article deals with iariners and their problems.

ii the Iowa citizenry. and the question ai es it it is
the host, were over open to burioonery it now is after the
yip yapping of a publicity hunter. hIr. Darrow has been
doneuln injustice but a greater injustice has been done
the intelligence and pride oi the lows iarmer by this
person who icels it his social duty to protect tile rural
residents iroin the truth,

lir. Dari-ow says riuite plainly that he, not being a
tar-moi not certain it his diagnosis is correct. The
1in '21" is a city man who has merely observed iarm
conditions and statistics probably as impartially as tht‘
iearci- oi biiiioonei-y has partially, it seems that this ir a
case oi the critic opening himselt to criticism.

The American inrmor, this is what Darrow mils him,
is amply able to care ior himself without the aid or social
workers, and it does not hurt any person to race the
tools. Dill'lmr has been a bit hard on the humor, it is
true, but then exaggeration murc surely accomplishes
tho required end in a quicker manner.

(‘OnllHL to the idea which might be. gotten from
Mclx'niley’s criticism, Dari-ow does not ridicule the farmer
any more than one tarnicr would in joilying another.
Tlic butt oi Iinrrow's article is niiricd at the perpetrators
at tho Mani sl-lallgen bill, who, he intimates, invelgled
the runner into believing he needed govcrnmontal com-
pensation ior his cl'olls.

it seems sound cconomics on the part of the eminent
ionicr that thc gii-ing or a “lmllnty” to the iurmnr on his
produce yiolatcs ll'ellslilluwn laws. With a pointed
thrust he adds that a bounty would go direct to the bene-
a v, something which a tariii docs not.

Mr. Darrow says in closing that the farmer, please:
note he does not say the Iowa farmer, has shown no
inclination to tliinli, bilt one feels quite certain that he,
like college stlidents, could not be made to believe the
moon was a piece oi green cheese.

Tile farmer has too many men who are willing to bc-
conie the watchdogs or his reputation and who in their
endeavor to do so make him the more ludicrous. The
solution at the farmer's problem is his own and the
sooner this is learned the sooneradecislon of some worth
will he received by him,."ihe best of Iowa citizenry,"
