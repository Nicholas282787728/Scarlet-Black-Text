MAN VS. PLAN.

Today is hundred factions iare ed—
vancing their pet panacea for society's
ills. There are innumerable plans tor
the solution of this and that interna-
Commissions,
conferences, multiply with confusing
rapidity. '

And the hopeless thing about the
whole situation is that methods and

tional evil. boards,

machinery, alone, Will not give any
problem a lasting 01' a satisfactory set-
tlement. Nor are they the most im-
portant ingredient of an adequate rem-
edy.

More than methods and machinery,

the world needs men. Men who are.

earnest and sincere. Men, who,

the past. have a penetrating vision of
the future. Men, with a. liberal 1min—
iug in the highest sense of the word,
who have developed a. keep unpreciar

which their own party, or sent, or
class may be guilty. have dcvcloped a
tolerant attitude toward similar short
comings in their fellows, Men who
are honest, for personal integrity must
he the cornerstone of any successﬂll
social or political ediﬁce.

Contrary to orthodox political sci—
ence, we believe that the man is more
important than the plan.

lVe American people have developed
machinery at the expense of men. We
have made it fetish of formulae, In—
tricate governmental structures have
flourished and stetesmansliip has der
cayed.

We believe that the best guarantee
of good government lies in d complex
system generously endowed with mu-
molly antagonistic elements.

We believe that some supernntural
power will intervene to solve the‘ dire
ﬁculties of our complex civilization if
we have enough caucuses and conven—
tions, enough committees in‘ our legis-
lative halls, enough ballot boxes on
our street corners.

manrmade and men-operated.

Any plan, good or had, Will naturally
partake of the cheracter of the men
who operate it, A bad plan will work
better in the hands of a. good man.
But a good. plan will be ruined in the
hands of a bad man.

Choice of a Career

From the Yale News

THE NlNETY- FOUR

Someone, probably an insurance
agent, was quoted reccmly as saying
that from the mass of one hundred
college graduates one individual only
rose to the Polo and butler class, peril.
'ously near the (op of the ﬁnancial lad‘
dor. Five others became comfortably
oil and found themselves after twenly
years at the small yacht and chauffeur
stage. The other ninety-four presum-
ably congregate in the great section of
the American people who drive their
own Buicks to the golf club. In other
words, dreaming about being a rich
man is one thing, and making the grade
is “something else again."

Yelthe ninety-foul- presumably work
justas hard as the sumptuous six. Their
business is the axis on which a small
and uninteresting world revolves. They
have become devotees of the dollar
and when that ﬁckle deity deserts, have
nowhere else to turn. Jammcd in a
dull, straight rut of business they can
never leave the road and jump the fence
into ﬁner ﬁelds of life, This, then, is
the portion of ninety-(our men out of
every hundre‘d now on the campus.

The answer to the problem lies in
the proper choice of a career.

 

Between now and Commencement we
shal have something to offer on the
subject of ”Careers.” Watch for the space

They couldn’t destroy
the work he did

“The Republic has no need for savants,”
sneered a tool of Robespierre as he sent
Lavoisier, founder of modern chemistry, to
the guillotine. A century later the French
Government collected all the scien l 0
studies of this great citizen of Paris and
published them, that the record of his re-
searches might be preserved for all time.

Lavoisier showed the errors of the theory
of phlogiston—that hypothetical, material
substance which was believed to be an ele-
ment of all combustible compounds and to
produce ﬁre when liberated. He proved
ﬁre to be the union of other elements with
a gas which he named oxygen.

Lavoisier’s work goes on. In the Research
Laboratories of the General Electric Com-
pany the determination of the effects of
atmospheric ail-on lamp ﬁlaments, on metals
and on delicate instruments is possible be-
cause of the discoveries of Lavoisier and
his contemporaries.
