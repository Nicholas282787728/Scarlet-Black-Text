iwol‘ld today as we are necessnry to
Russia. We want her grain and her
naturel resources. Russia is now anx-
ious for help. In the consideration of
[he chonccs for peace it must also he
rerncinhcrcd that Russia has it Well
disciplined army and that so long as
that army exists in Russia the {moon
of Europe is on on unstahlc touting,
This is one form of resistnncc tot
the Washington conference and lol
those who oppose war.

He dolincd the English point of
view as opposed to that of France,
which desires only the crippling oi;
lei-many ,as being thot ihcrc must be‘
s recovery of the markets oi the
world; if not we die. "We need," hc

, declared, “not money hut the ebh and
ﬂow of commerce," Every time that
LGermany makes a payment on her In-
demnity, he stated ,the value of the
mark depreciatcs and this deprecia-
tion enables her to undersell us in the
markets of the world. But even while
she thus undercuts the world in com—
name she ruins herself. Some kind.
of bridge must be erected between the
English and French point of view to
leave the situation and as an effort
along this line sir Philip referred to
the recent exchanges between the two
governments. .

The speakers analysis of the Wash
ington Conference was illuminating.
While admitting that it has failed to

,fulﬁll the hopes of those who wished}
for a sort of international court of,
justice, has not gone into the deep
cohscs and has not removed hatreds
between people and economic pres-r
sure, while it has produced no assur-
ance that war will not happen again,
it has done a great thing when it has
abolished the colnp'titilm between this
country and Great Britain in inc»
building of liclilc ship . This how

two nations cl .er hgrt‘i-
uziship and llh' l‘cllClc

hurdro of tax s, The con.

ference has also broken up tho Anglo.

Japanese nllioucu and has in all it
in the four notion pact and this Slrl

,‘Phillp believes a good thing though he}
feels that the AngloJapzmese alliaucc‘
was useful in time of war. England,

;he says, hopes that the Washingtonl
conference will be the ﬁrst in a series‘
which will,dcal with other problems,

Isuch as land armaments and the like.

possibilities are chcro Clark of Des

that the governor may resign in order
to tone the post himself.
