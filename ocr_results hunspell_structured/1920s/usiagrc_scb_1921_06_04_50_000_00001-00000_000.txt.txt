.RECITAL, BY LOIS
ROGERS PLEASES

Large Audience Attends Recital
Friday Night. '

The piano recital given by Lois
Rogers Friday evening was heard by
a large audience. it was a splendid
recital marked by brilliant coloring
and precision in playing that showed
Miss Rogers exceptional ability as a
pianist. Features that added to the
interest of her program were her well
brought out themes and climaxes and
the speed with which she played with
the rapid passages. The Tchaikovsky
concerto that she played with orches-
tra and organ is one of the most dif-
ficult concertos written for piano and
her performance of it 'was fine. The
second movement was especially well
liked. Her encore of Irish tunes was
a popular number.

This is the last one of the season and

(By Atwood KnleS).

At a meeting of the Honor 6 club letter each year they have partlcl. held Thursday afternoon

June 2, steps were taken to remove
the existing misunderstanding con-
cerning the wearing of Service stripes
on the Honor G sweater.

Honor G men shall in the future, wear
one stripe only for each year that the
letter is won, this rule to be effectice

in all three major sports. foot—
ball, basketball. and track.

Thai is to say. that if a man has
won his letter only once in any one
sport, regardless or Whethnr or not be

only one Serylce stripe for that sport.
This is only justice to those who have
been on the squad and have won their

play. “Clarence", which will be given
class day, Saturday, June ,11. at the
Colonial theater under the direction
of Professor J. P. Ryan. Kenneth
Geddes is assisting Prof‘essor Ryan in

ing a part in the production.
"Clarence" is a clever farce-comedy
of young American life written by the
young American specialist, Booth
Tarkington. The plot is centered
around a young soldier, Clarence, who
has just returned from service in‘

enviable reputation for being able to‘
drive army mules without swearingj
His reputation came home with him,‘
and Mr. Wheeler thought that such a‘
talented young man would surely be
able to hell) run his household. ,Clar-
ence makes a desperate attempt, and in
the course of events tunes the piano
(we question it], and does what a
plumber cannot do. With a start
such as this interesting developments
can be expected.

The cast has been changed slightly:
since the first announcement. Ken-I
neth Geddes is taking the part made
vacant by Tom Scary, who is leaving
school early. The cast which is.
working on the play at present is:
Clarence 7 David Evans
