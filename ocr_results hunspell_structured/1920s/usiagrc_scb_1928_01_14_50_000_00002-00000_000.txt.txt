Till-2 GRINNELL HERITAGE.

Like mischievous children we take a ilendisli delight
in calling attention to disagreeable incts about Gl'innell
life. It has been our practice at times to make \lllcom»
plimentary comments upon school policies. Griunc’ll's
closest iricnds will always be her scvorcst critics ond
it has only been our regard ior the school that has led
us to criticise her. Among the many unfavorable res
marks, lion-ever, it is very easy to lose sight oi the coili-
lnendable icaturcs oi the school.

There is, without doubt, some quality oi virtue or
praise that Gl‘lnnell possesses, unknown on campuses oi
other institutions. We need only to visit other schols
and to acquaint ourselves with their administrations,

the dillcrcuce is. There is more il-ccdom and less re—
s raint at Grinnell. Somehow we or the student body
have bccn given a chance to develop our own livcs and to
iorniulato our own standard. “It: have been allowed
their iaculllcs, their stlldcnt bodies, to understand what
to say what we will, hear wllat there is to he heard,
and see all sides or life, good and bad, And in Lhis we
have entered into our greatest heritage,

Few other schools allow absolute freedom in strident
publications. How many institutions are as totally rrcc
iroul religious restrictions as Grinncll? Certainly not
[lie denominational colleges of the Mi(lr\\'est; and it we
are to judge by what we are told. even the state unive'
sitics are not immune trom religious dictation, At Grim
ncll an agnostic was admitted to the lecture platform
two lears ago.

Where else are all sides or public questions given
with such [rank openness and unlimited liberty? Ldst
year we heard two speakers on the labor question: one
was Paul Blanchar an avowed laborlcndcrnnd symbi-
Lilizcl'; the other was the advocate ol‘ :1 body of cili—
ployers and capitalists. Maude Roytlen. the English
mini ter, has been engaged to sneak despite the fact that
certain views she holds are not in accord with the cities
or Boston and Chicago and the president of the Wulnen’s
Christian Temperance Union.

students have unrestricted student government, They
are as free to make the lnost oi an atmosphere of toler-
ant liberty as they can. Similarly, the facility at Grinnell
college has never been told what it should lunch, or how
it should tcnch. Prolessors are their own censors, their
0\\'ll critics.

Some say Grinnell has a scliish spirit. it may be
true that Grinnell is not democratic, that the college is a
breeder pr snubs, oi inertcctuals, or non-entities. But
nowhere can any one say with truth that Grinnell is in
tolerant, bigoted and enchaincd. We have a greater res
spunsibllity to ourselves for the greater opportunities
given us, and it we fail to see and believe the truth, it
will be our fault.

BETTER SCHOOL SPIRIT.

School spi t would be given a distinct boost it cer»
tain practices were inaugurated at basketball games The
members at the Honor G club could add a note or color
to the crowd by sitting in a reserved section in the stands
and wearing their scarlet sweaters. This would also ins
sure returning “G" ztlllmlli a good seat in the stands. The
recently organized pep association could assnmc rc-
sponsihility for the you leaders and put an entertainment
between halves of the game, When the band plays the
school song at the close or the game all spectators might
remain standing in their places instead of just it few.
This makes the game mean much more than othcrw
uhcther Grinncll has won or lost. T, L.

 

Curricular Reform
Engages Country’s
Student Attention

New York, (by New Student Service)
~Footbaii having passed oii the
boards, curricular reiorni is ugain en-
gaging student attention in several
colleges. The undergraduate rciorm—
ers have taken iolr notice or the critic
cisms ovcrilowing current periodicals,
and have adopted a vigorous style in
attacking their campus problems.

The Unix crsity oi Washington Daily,
after publishing a series of student
criticisms oi the university and its
work, has summarized by blaming the
faculty “for the lack of intellectual
stimulus and study encouragement
prevalent on the campus." The main
draw-back it conceives us “(lie appal-
ling over-emphasis on activities for ac-
tivity’s sake, that insistence on actiy
ties at Washington which results in
the average Collegian striving to he an
activity bound irom ireshman days to
the and pi college.” The inculty is
blamed for having failed to eliminate
superfluous activities, and the Daily
presents the problem as one for the
teachers to solve,

President C. D, Gray oi Bates college
has appointed a student committee oi
twelve to examine the curriculum and
suggest modiﬁcations and changes,

begun by a senior committee last year.

the same problem, one composed or
tcachcrs. another of alumni, and a
third, serving as advisory, oi outsiders,

students in the College ior Women
at Western Reserve university have se-
lected representatives to serve as their
agents in presenting to the inculty
complaints against the curriculum.
They are members oi the student coun-
cil, who will work in conjunction with
n iaculty committee, to whom they will
make recommendations alter pnssingl
on student complaints,

The undergraduate curriculum com-
mittee at Haverfol'd college is draiting
its annual report to thc iaculty. Its
scope is wide, and its suggestions will
deal not only with the curriculum
proper, but also with the conduct at
strident arialrs and such matters as
improvement at library lighting condic
tions, and prompt dismissal oi
classes.

The main points in an under-gratin
rite report just presented to tnegiaculty
at the College or the City oi New
York propose revision or certain pre-
scribed courses lu order to permit
greater ircedum in are choice or elec-
tives, and the institution oi honors

College Graduates
Lead Others About
$72,000 In Earnings

Cilicago.——Bcst New Yea ‘s resolir
tion any Dad could make is to give his
son it college education.

College education is worth $72,000.
This is n nroiit oi 1.200 per cent on
an original investment oi $6,000,
which is the average total cost hi it
[our ycill's' course in college,

Deducting the cost oi the education
itscli: the student adds to his luau-c
income at the rate oi approximately
$15,000 a year during the time he is
in college.

As classes are held only five do
n week, this means potential earns
ing oi 070 a day to the strident -lor
each day spent in the class room.

These statements were made
Otto Y, schncrlng, President oi the
Baby Ruth Candy company, who is
an alumnus or the University oi Chi»
cago, in an address here,

"A college education is not only
very essential in modern business but
highly proﬁtable, ii the strident
spcnds his time in real study," Mr.
Schnevlng said. "The annual average
income or a high school graduate is
$2,200 and that oi a college graduate
$6,000. Total earnings or the two
classes or men up to the‘age oi 60
are approximately plnccd at $73,000
and $150,000. This gives the college
graduate at land oi $72,000 over the
high school youth.

“This is the age oi specialization
and scieutlilc management in bus
iness, in which a college education is
becuming alomst an absolute neces-
sity."
