In the collegiate world nothing is

One of the striking things of the
whole situation is the unwillingness of

When the United States is inl

At Chapel
This Week

Wrdu . :ly
Dr Edward A. Steiner addressed
the chapel on Wednesday on the
theme, “When Will Christmas Come."
An article in the December issue of
the Atlantic Monthly formed the has-
is for Dr. Steiner's talk in which lie
lamented the materialistic and prac-
tical turn which our spirit of Christ-
mas has taken. A world sickucss.
out of which men long to rise ob-
scures the very basis of the true
Christmas spirit. »
Dr. Steiner cited the first paragraph
of the article in the Atlantic as being
one of utmost beauty. it is quoted
here; “Only God could have thought
of Christmas. lts beauty is beyond
the wit of mortals, so simple in its
’subhmity,»so homey, yet so heavenly.
On a tapestry woven of stableestl'aw
and starlight it unveils a picture to
soften and purify the heart. and to
,briug us back from a wisdom that is
{not wise because it is hard, unholy
,and unhopeful."
,l Elaborating upon this theme, Dr.
.Steiner spoke of how the beauty is
.crushed out of the Christmas spirit by
the hard materialism of a. world
,rulcd by prejudice and hate. Christ-
npas in the true sense can come only
when the combined efforts of all peo-
rple have produced a sweeter spiritual
relation and a deeper appreciation of
human values.

 

Thursday

l Following out the line of discussion
takeu up by Dr. Steiner in his chapel
talk the day before on “When Will
Christmas Come," Prof. J. D. Stoops
took up some of the phases of Chris-
tian doctrine today that were not
taught by ‘Jesus Christ.

Professor Stoops said that Chl'istr
Imas would nht really come untiT' we
got a Christian view, and in analyz-
‘ing the Christian view showed that
it had changed considerably since its
beginnings. Christianity is hardly
,any longer the teaching of Jesus, but
has been organized and interpreted
so much that instead‘of its original
social and external aspect, it has be
:come more a matter of internal con—
{cention and doctrine.

The freshmen defeated the seniors
18 to s, and the sophomores downed
the juniors 23 to is, in the lirstrouud
of the interrelass basketball series
lilayed Thursday afternoon.

Flashing a cleverniassing- attack,
coupled with the air tight guarding
of Fall and Coggcsball, the prep lidsA
ket tossers defeated the seniors by the
score of is to s. The preps got right
down to business at the start of the
game by scoring a basket and were
never headed. A few minutes after
the opening whistle, ircCuily cascd in
a sleeper and the irosh were on their
way to victory. Gray and Schroer
cach contributed a basket during the
first half and Gray counted two from
the foul line while the best the upper-
classmen could do was two points via
the freethrow route.

in the second half the seniors bola
stored their defense slightly and held
the freshmen to eight points while
they scored si Gray looped in long
shots and Schrocr and McCully each
sneaked one in from under the basket
and cogseshall added two free
throws.

Tho seniors clearly showed a lack
of practice as their passing was rage
god and they fumbled frequently. The
preps passed well and displayed a
good eye for the basket, especially
Gray who made three and came dang—
crously close on several other occas-
ions.

Mr. Beale. though at first reluctant ' '

to give his opinions on the subject or
eastern and Westenl schools, finally
‘consellted. “One of the most strik-
ing diiicronces is the terrible touch-
iness regarding criticism of Grinnell.
1 have encountered it so much. AD
eastern institution is always open to
criticism without oliensc."

“Appnllingly little work is done
‘hel‘e,” he continued. “or the better
students I have no complaint, but the
'averdge students wastes too much of
ibis time. A student should think
rather than memorize; the average
{student seems to place the burden 01
thought on his instructor and expects
to absorb it in class.”

Finds Vw Social Luck

“ i find no social lack here,"
said when questioned. "The only
thing i miss is the lack of other

things. such as lectures and music."

no eastern student is more con-
servative or formal in dress, he said
liust as Mr. Harriman had. A student
.thcre would not think of wearing a
sweater to class nor of taking up ev-
ery new fad.

“I find here a gcncral lack of court-
csy among the students not only to
lthcir instructo s but to each other it
is inherent in an eastern student: I
cannot explain it,"

Acqunillttlucc

“It is very easy to become acquaint-
ed here. I like that, I think it very
wholesome. I lived two years in a
dormitory at Harvard and never spoke
to the man rooming across the hall.
Eastern students have close friend
ships, but they do not speak to those

'th whom they have no particular
deli-c to become friends."

l in speaking of Crinncll, he said.
“Grinnell i. one of the good colleges
'n the w'est. I have wondered where
it gets that reputation in comparing
it to eastern schools. it is certainly
not the average level of work done:
but it is due, I believe, to the fact

Two shots through the hoop at a
crucial moment by Spencer enabled
the sophomore quintet to triumph
over the Juniors by a 23 to 18 score.
It was a hard fought game and some
fast and furious basketball was dis-
played by both sides. Entering the

last quarter with the count 18 to 14'

in favor of the sophs, the juniors
brought the score to eighteen all by
baskets by Culver and Weitz. Spencer
then came through _with two
shots and put the game on ice.

Larson led the auacu of the Sopho-
mores by marking thirteen points,
clevcu of which were scored in the
first half. The ball ended with the
Sophs leading 13 to 7, SpenEer ac-
counting for the other two points.
During the second half the Junior

guarded more closely, watching Lax-J

son in particular, and bettered their
passing attack. Riucfort was the big
gun for the juniors, scoring seven
points.

The sophomores presented a slash-
ing combination and if they improve
their team work, will be a hard age
gregation to stop. The lineup:

The announcement that Kuute
Rockne has signed a threc year con-
tract to coach at Columbia university
comes as a distinct surprise to sport
followers. Rockne has been turning
,dcwn offers ’so regularly the last few
years that his acceptance to go to
Columbia comes as a great shock. It
,is hftrd to visualize Rockne separate
from Notrc Dame athletics.

A recent bulletin issued at West
Point speaks of Ernest Schmidt, ex!
’24, in this manner: "Schmidt played
;right guard all season and was a
‘tower of strength to his team. His
jgreat play at the position ofl
guard was commented upon by many
of the foremost experts of the
season, some of whom named him
as an Alermericful possibility.”
Schmidt was an honor G man while
at Criunell, playing a guard position
on the Pioneer eleven.

Dr. Naboth Osborne, pastor of the
First Congregational church of Bur—

will deliver the Gates Memorial lec-
tos-es here the first week in February,
comes highly recommended as a stu-
dent and polished and interesting
speaker.

The Gates Memorial lectures were
instituted in honor of George A.
G,ates who was president of Grinnell
President
Gates was vitally interested in Chris—
tian sociology and to him belongs the
credit for the establishment of the
department of Applied Christianity
here.

At the time of President Grates"
death a group of friends created a
foundation which is expected to bring
annually to Grinnell, lectures dealing
with the application of Christianity
to political and social problems.
