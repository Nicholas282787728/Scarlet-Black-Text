MITCHELL WRITES OF
SOUTH AMERICAN LIFE

(Continued tram page one)
Arlee has been a sore spot between
Peru and Chile for a number of years.
{At the present time Chile has possese

sion. There is a great roeii, “The
3\l0l'r0", at the entrance to the harbor
that a Peruvian general rode his horse
oft at in prciercnce to surrendering to

great war. The rock is about ﬁve hun-
'died feel: high so it was some jump,
but still, 1 thing it a pity to kill a per-
fectly good horse that way.

Santiago being the capital or Chile
has many large public buildings as
well as hundreds of heautitui homes.
The streets are wide, as a rule well
paved and lighted One, The Ala—
meda, runs through the entire length
or the city to the bed of what was
tormerly the Mapocho river. It is a
two»\vay streetpsomething you ﬁnd very
rarely in this country as most at the
.streets arc too narrow for traitic to
pass. There is one place in the city
that has a parade every afternnon trorn
six to eight o'clock that is really worth
going to see. it is in the Pargue
Cousino, one or the roost heautitul nate
urai parks in South America. Auto-
mobiles dl'lVe out to the park and the
people get out and walkvaround in a
circle; with the men going one way
and the ladies the other, or course.
When' you see the girls in dresses or
every color you can imagine and
and some you can't, you think you are
in Fairyland. The trees, palms, and
.tiowcrs in the background help to
carry out the illusion, Arid this does
not happen only one night in the week,
but every night. It is an interesting
as well as hesithtul way to spend the
hours betore dinner.

Modem City. a

You hear a great deal about how
Chile still clings to the old Spanish
customs. I have not round this to he
the case at all. The city is full at
modern American automobiles, the
down townstrcets are lined with large
stores and commercial houses or all
kinds, and in the residential section
you do not see Romeos making love to
Juliets who are leaning out ot a win-
dow or from a balcony. In this latter
they are rapidly coming around to the
American methods which is for better
or worse 1 am surei can't say which,
not having tried the balcony scheme,

Business here is rather bad at pres-
cnt due to the poor rate of exchange
on New York. But with the establish—
ment of a National Bank thcrcby ﬁx-
ing the value or the peso, business
should be very good, especially tor tho
U. 5.

There are a lot of good business op—
portunities hero tor live young busi-
ness men, and I should like .to sc a
tow Grinenll men some down in the
next year or two. This docs not
apply to Chile alone but to Peru, Bo.
ltvia, Argentine, and Brazil. Bolivia
with its rich deposits of ore is especi-
ally inviting.

I've probably said a lot at things i
shouldn't: have, and lett out some far
more interesting details but I have
gathered together the things that stuck
in my memory, It there is anyone in
Grinneli who cares to know about
some particular line of business, or
product or this country, I would be
only too glad to do my best to get the
information desired.

With best wishes tor a winning bas-
ketball and track season and dances
every week, i am yours to command,

0. HUGH MITCHELL.
