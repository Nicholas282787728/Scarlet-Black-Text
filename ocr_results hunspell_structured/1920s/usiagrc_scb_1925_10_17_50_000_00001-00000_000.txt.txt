.CATHCART AMONG INJURED

l'etcmh Gould is Out for Indciinitc
Period; )lnrlln bxpccuu llnvk
WilJi Fold Monthly.

\l'ith one week left before the
Homecoming battle with Drake, the
Pioneers are striving for the stmngest
possible lineup It is the hope of
Scarlet and Black followers that
Coaches Hylaud and Black will be
able to send. their full force against
the Bulldogs, in spite of the many
cripples on the team.

Tom Cathcart, veteran guard,
oeived injuries in the Minnesota game
which have kept him in civilian
clothes all week, and it is doubtful if
he will be in shape for Saturday’s
game. Hap Moran and Don Wolfe.
have both been out of scrimmage the
past week, nursing sore legs, but
they are expected to join the squad
Monday. Arden McClain, clever end,
is on the sidelines with an injured
chest, but will most likely he in the
lineup against Drake.

Nihlo and Parks have been holding
down the end positions in this week's
practice. Nihlo played a good game
last week and is counted on to turn
back the end attempts of Drake.
Parks has shown hits of good work
this season, but he has not played reg—
ularly. He can be relied upon to
fill McClain's position if the latter is
not able to start the game. Schal‘nr
weber and Rose make two good re-
serves for the wing jobs, and can
show up well against the best.

Dcvis Showing Up

Dams and Martin have proved to he
zl real team of tackles, Both played
wonderful games at Minneapolis and
were mixing things up in great style.
They are fast, handle themselves
well and are always giving an account
of themselves. Martin has been shift~
ed this year from guard, where he
shin-ed for one season, He is quick on
analyzing plays and so far this year
has figured greatly in the team's
succcss. Davis is playing his first
year 0! varsity ball, having been cap-
tain and astar of last year's preps. He
is big and rangy and tears things
loose when he gets going, as was on»
danced in the Minnesota game. How-
arth and Weitz arc two men who have
seen service this year and have prov-
en themselves to be most effective.
Braden can also be relied upon to
fill in at tackle.

With Cathcart out. Carl‘ and See-
land are handling the guards in nice
shape, Cal-1 has seen quite a bit of
play this fall and has been a, tower
of strength at times. Sealanrl is
playing his first year on tho var»
sity and is developing fast. He has
lollowcd the bail closely and has tumv
cd many breaks in for Grinnell. These
two boys are big and add much to
the defensive strength at the line.
Spencer, of last year's prep outfit, is
available as guard and should be able
to take care of mo of these positions.

Meyer Phys Pivot;

Mover still holds forth as center,
with Peterson in reserve. The big
fellow is playing good ball this year
and is holding his own with the best
of them. He is reliable and cliolr
headed, plays a fine defensive game,
and is about all any pivot man should
he. Peterson, letter man last year.
has had trouble with his hands, but
is now in shape and gives the coaches
at good reserve for Meyers ob.

The line as a whole has acquitted
ltsclf very well so far and has play-
ed Stellar hall. Opposing teams have
been unable to gain consistently
through it, and in the most part,
have turned. to n. passing attack rath-
er than to buck the lion.

Worry Over Backs.

than last; am I getting anything out
of this course? “This bus less of
learning. he continued, is like a. game
of tennis; the hall is served, then it
ls up to the player to hit it."

Dr, Davis warned against the mere
echoing of knowledge. “Look and
see, tllink and talk, Write and draw"
is the advice he gives to his Harvard
classes and to all other students. The
doctor sees a vast improvement in the
attitude of the Student of today cums
pared with those twenty-five or fifty
years ago. He recalled the vast
amount of cheating he witnessed as
an undergraduate. "Today,” he con-
tinued, "cheating is no longer fash-
ionable." In Harvard anyone who
cheats is "out of style, of! Color, is
green!”

Dr, Davis has put into actual prac-
tice his theory of original ohservuc
tio He has travelled almost coll~
tlnually Since 1868, when he made his
first trip to Europe. The years 1870
to 1573 were spent in research work
in South America. l’de then made an—
othel‘ trip to Europe and in 1878 he
went around the world, in lsss he
made a bicycle tour through central
Eumne.

The doctor has also spent several
years in survey and research work in
the Grand Canyon. Rocky Mountains
and ill Mexico. In 1905 he made a
trip around the West and East coast
0E Africa. The following year Dr. Da-
VlS organized an international sco—
graphical party with which he spent
a year ill Central Europe. He has
since then, travelled in England
France, Ireland, Italy and the Lesser
Antilles,

This is Dl‘ Dllyis' third experience
as a visiting professor from Harvard.
In 1376 he was visiting professor in
geology and geography at the Uni—

'versity of Berlin and in 1918 at the

University or Paris, and now this
western circuit which includes Po-
mona College and the University of
Southern California

“I hesitate to ascribe thc tcn com-

they sound so like the work of hu-
man minds," said Dr. William Morris

bodily forms.”

The first theory is illustrated by

How barbarous thesc command

shalt not kill." Kill whom? Why,
your frlen it was all right to kill
your enemies, in fact God has espec-

“if the Commandments hcdmadc it
