Talking on “The Spirit of Man"
Proi, 1-1. L. Haywood said at Vespers
Sunday, "To cure cynicism about luﬂl'k
kind one should co’nsidcr that man is
born lacking knowledge; hc experienr
ees handicaps of poverty. hereditary
and lacli oi suitahle education and one
rironmcnt; and the human race hasn't
reached its l'ull development. We must
trust God tor in order to be God, he
must be a pel-iect God. a God who ea ,
not rail to do anything a God can do.
in the same way we must not swerve
h-oin abundance in human nature.
which in time will be victorious and
will‘ reach perrcetion in fundamental
things."
