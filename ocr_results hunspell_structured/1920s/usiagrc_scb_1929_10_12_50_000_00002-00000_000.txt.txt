THE ANGLOVAMERICAN BUGABOO.

With the extraordinary emotional burden of World's
Series this week, and with Homecoming only a week off,
the average Grinnell student may possibly have over—
looked the fact that a somewhat prominent English-
man is now in this country, attending afternoon teas
and state dinners. We, therefore, announce our “scoop."

:He is none other than Premler Ramsay MacDonald of
Great Britain, and/his visit to “America. and his confer-
ences with President Hoover this Week have been of ut-
most importance -in bringing Britain and America clos—
er to settling the many Anglo-American problems now
claiming the consideration of statesmen in both coun-
tries. '

College students should be Concerned in his visit
for two reasons. First, there is certainly a possibility
that if Anglo-American relations continue as in the past
few years, the college student of today may he forced
to he the buck private of tomorrow in an American
clash With Great Britain, Second, Anglo-American
problems are not temporary, but of growing seriousness.
In. the near future the collage students of the present
will face them as citizens of this country and should be
intelligently informed upon them. ,

It is“ hopeless to enumerate all the problems be-
tween Britain and America today, but back of all the
discussion today is the question of What the present bit-
ter competition between Britain and America for the
markets.of theworld will lead to and what is to he done

with the problem of the freedom of the seas.

Ever since the beginning of the twentieth century,
America has sought raw materials and sold manufac-
tured products in the world markets, competing with
Great Britain. Today the competition is keener, with
Britain seeking to regain her pro-war prosperity and
our increasing population demanding increased mar-
kets to maintain our prosperity. Tomorrow no one
knows what clashes may occur between the expanding
financial interests of the two nations.

Each nation believes that its navy must equal
thator the other to protect its commerce in case of
war, Great Britain because it depends on an imported
food supply to live, the United States because of Erie"
nin’s insistence that no nation can trade With a. coun-
try with which Britain is at war.

MacDonald and Hoover this Week announced that
naval parity had been agreed upon between the two
countries they represent, This is Without doubt a great.

‘step toward amicable relations between the two coun—

tries. Mere naval parity, however. does not take away
the fact thdt the question of the freedom of the seas
remains. and that until this later question is settleed. no
permanent settlement can he realized. Britain insists
on closing the seas when she is at war: America claims
the right to continue her trade with all nations.

The best plan offered so far has been Hint of Wick-
ham Steed, editor of the English Review of Reviews.
He suggests that when it shall be necessary under an
international agreemEDt, such us the League Covenant
agreement, for Britain to enforce a blockade against
an aggressor nation, the United States shall not inter»
fete, while if Britain‘disregards a decision by the
League of Nations Council and goes to war with some
country, 'the United States may continue to trade with
that country. . ‘

It is this delicate question of the freedom of the
seas that new faces and probably will for some time,
face Britain and America. It can only he settled by a
spirit of compromise such as is manifested in the Wick-
ham~Steed plan. Until it is and until British and Amer-
ican capitalists agree to get together on a. disposal of
world markets, the Anglo-American problem will he
with us. This all means a question not of months but
of years. Therefore we say that not only should Mac—
Donald's momentous visit to this country occupy the

serious consideration or college students, but that they .

should begin now to cultivate a lasting interest in In-
ternational affairs, for on that stage the great dramas
of the next few decades will be played.

Play Production
Classes Work on

Coming Pageant

The play production classes have
been working daily on the scenery
for “The Pioneers oi Progress," the
historical pageant to he presented
next Thursday and Friday evenings.

Both interior and exterior settings
will be used. Margaret Napier de-
sigmed the setting for the prairie
scenes. Each member of the advan-
ced play production class designed a
setting, and Miss Napier's was see

lected.

The prairie scenes use simple con-
ventional settings made up of a ser-
ies of blue curtains of transparent
gauze with Iowa prairie flowers and
grasses consisting of cat—tails, prairie
grass, sun flowers, and blue bells
made in semi-conventional design.
The curtains were purchased in New
York City. The flowers have been
out from pieces of colored oil cloth
and glued to the curtains. The
prairie setting will he used in various
comhinations for all exterior scenes.

"or course," states Mr. Pryor who
is supervising the work, “really good
lighting is most necessary to bring
out the desired effects.” William
