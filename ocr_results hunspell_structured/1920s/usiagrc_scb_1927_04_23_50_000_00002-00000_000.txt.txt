Now that spring is here and summer is in the ottihg.
it is very tr)ing to the average or rather to the iioruial
student. to sit comfortably in the class room and listen
to a professor whose mind and soul are likewise squirm-
ing under the unjust fate of spending the hour indoors.
The. student tidgets. The lecture is very dry; no one
could be interested in the economic hardships ot the early
Puritans as compared to those of present day immigrants.
The day outside is far more inviting.

The school year is on the down grade. No one very
much cures whether classes meet or go hang. Any one
with an eye to the tnture has been saving cuts until these
warm days came along. and all the foolish ones are cut-
ting anyway. The chapel is deserted; in winter there

AN OVERWORKED IDEAL.

”Service." service to one's fellow men. has enjoyed
increasing popularity as an ideal or liv 3. There is an
overwhelming tendency to regard "service" as the em-

bodiment of all that is noble and worth while, the goal
toward which all our aims must he directed if they are

not to he in rain. Almost any sermon one hears. or any
lecture one attends, or any paper one reads contains

some mention or "service." life's crowning ideal.
To be sure. a worth while life is it life of service.

But a life lived with service alone as an ideal is not on

in danger of tailing that ideal. it is inevitably in pain
of being expended without any deep understanding of the
tiindaniental values which make up the very stuff of liv»
ing. There is only one right way to live. and that is to
live artistically: this is the law which too many advocates
or “service" have lost in the mazes 0! their superficial
thinking. Any otlorts to he or "service" to others without
first developing to the full one‘s own talents and capa-
bilities are predestined to tailure. “Service" is the nailn‘s
al result of something like an artistic adjustment of the
individual to his surroundings and to his fellow beings.
and this adjustment can be gained. not by any attempts

to “help the other renew." but the, development within
oneself of a stalnai-t and independent character. All

Sunday school lessons to the contrary there is no such
thing as helping other people. There i if one develop
the power to embody his ideals in his living. the possibility
ot inspiring other people to help themselves

"Service.” that universal term for a universal ideal.
represents no ideal at all. but the simple and natural
development of success in the art of living.

CHARLEY’S AUNT

With

As the Auntie From Brazil Where
The Nuts Come From

No child is too young, no man too old to roar with laughter at
the delightful antics of the inimitable SYD CHAPLIN and his staff
of fun provokers. in the most wholesome and humorous comedy
ever known to the stage or adapted to the screen.

This is no ordinary comedy. Here is farce of the highest
order with its scintillating humor magniﬁed by its transference to

the screen.

“CHARLEY'S AUNT“ [N MOVIES.

Wherever the stage farce of "char-
lc s Aunt" has been played of late
ycai. the experience has been that
fathers who saw the play and laughed
heartily years ago have gone and tak-
en their sons, and mothers have taken
their daughters. thus passing the fun

of "Charley's Aunt" down from gener “

ntion to generation

Now that the famous old laughing
success is in ﬁlm with Syd Chaplin in
the title role. all those who have seen
the play will probably go again to see
how the laughs have been secured in
the movie version. Those who have

already seen it say there are even'
more laughs and roars in the ﬁlnlthztn‘

there were in the play. and if that is
true. it must he a howl. for Charley's
Aunt as a play has records oi more
laughs than any other tarce which
hits ever been written.
