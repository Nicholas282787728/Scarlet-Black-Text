From Report
Foundation Issues Report on

Present-Day ‘Evils of
College Athletics.

Says Conditions Bad

Finds Recruiting, Proselyting of
Athletes Common; Iowa U.

Comparatively Pure.

Grinnell failed to draw any pub-

licity this week from the report of
the Carnegie foundation on athletic
conditions in 112 North American in»
stitutions of learning, made public
on Thursday morning in the daily
press, as the name of this college
did not appear among those listed as
investigated.
s The substance and tone of the bul-
letin, which caused a sensation this
week throughout the country was
that subsidizing and recruiting of
athletes is almost 'a universal prac-
tice throughout the universities and
colleges of this country. Three and
a half years were consumed in pre-
paring the exhaustive report, during
which the Carnegie representatives
paid personal visits to 130 institu-
tions.

~ Drake Is Guilty

Of the schools with whicb'Grin-
nell has or has had athletic relations.
the University of Okahoma and Uni-
versity of Missouri, Drake university
and Coe college were all cited in the
report for having violated the
amateur college code in some way
or another. ,

Drake was found to be using the
alumni secretary as an intermediary
between the athletic department and
the athlete in the recruiting process.
At Drake, too, the business manager
of the college writes directly to
athletes, while an organized attempt
is made by a paid official to seéure
off-campus jobs for athletes

At the University of Iowa athletes
are subsidized _by positions as sport-
ing goods salesmen, the report af-
ﬁrms, while at the State University
also the fraternity chapters are used
as a kind of clearing house for sub~
sidizing transactions between an
athlete and an alumnus or some oth-
er person, while coaching expenses
are listed as abnormally high at
Iowa City. »

School Heads Blamed

“Bulletin No. 23" contains 383
pages telling of methods. practices
and conditions now obtaining in col-
lege athletics, but particularly striks
es at.the practices of subsidizing and
recruiting. For these prevailing
tendencies, the foundation places the
responsibility on the shoulders of
school executives. who, it says. have
let the athletic policies stray out of

DireCtory Has
Rule Changes

New Eligibility and Grade
Point Systems Outlined
in 'Herdbook.’

Two changes in rules and regula~
tions appear in the new issue of the
student directory, which was put in

circulation last week, according to
Miss Bethana Mccandless, registrar.

With regard to eligibility the new
rule reads; “To be eligible for all
other activities (which excepts ath-
letics)‘ a student must have ten grade
points for the preceding semester,
and mus't be, free from current cons
ditions. Eligibility for all events
shall be determined one week in ad-
vance of participation. Current con-
ditions imposed or removed during
this time shall not affect eligibility."

The former rule with regard to
work done in the preceding semester
required a student to have passed
twelve hours. with a grade of "C" in
half the total registration. The
former ruling with regard to eligibib
ity stated that eligibility was deter-
mined two weeks in advance of par-
ticipation. students are urged by
the registrar to submit eligibility
lists in ample time so that current
conditions may be removed one we'ek
before the event is scheduled.

The system of grade points has
also been changed. According to the
new system each semester hour of
“A" counts three points. each hour
of "B” two points, and each hour of
“C" one point. “D" grades do not
count, and ”E grades deduct one
point for each hour.

To make the “Grade List" students
will be required to have sixty points
for the year, and students who have
earned eighty points shall be “Grim
nell Scholars.”

Forensic Plans

and, Tryout Soon

According to tentative plans, men's

room. This decision was made at a
meeting held last Monday.

At a date shortly after the dinner.
Forensic will hold tryouts to ﬁll the
nine Vacancies in the club rostra left
by graduation and failure to return
of last year's members.

During the meeting Monday, the
club discussed Anglo—American re—
lations. At each meeting; two
members argue opposite sides of a
question and then hold an open
forum.

Edward Tyler and Donald Brodlne
will leadpan informal discussion upon
the question “IS Education a
Handicap to Clear Thinking?“ at the
next meeting on October 30.

Serenaders Make Music

Pioneers and Bulldogs Battle Tonight

for Traditional Prize of Oaken Bucket .

One of the big prizes of tonight's
contest will be the 01d oaken
Bucket, the traditional bone of con»
tention between Drake and Crinnell
football teams Since 1927. in that
year, a Crinnell alumnus, realizing
that there should be some coveted
article set up as an inspiration to the
better things in life such as courage
in battle and victory (We hope). gave
to the two schools this old time
drinking cup.

The bucket is the old iron-bound
type that is praised so highly in
musical circles and denounced so
soundly by the Society for the Pre-
vention of the Spread of the Wiggle
worm. 0n the wooden sides of the
bucket are painted the scores of all
Crinnell—Drake games in football
history.

Ever since the prize was won by
Drake at Grinnell's Homecoming two
years ago, it has rested in the trophy
case at the Des Moines instition.
Having lost to Drake in both con-
tests since 1927. the Pioneers will be
out for blood, ready to ﬁght to the
very end, and will concede nothing
till the ﬁnal whistle.

Jane Lewis, will have a very import«
ant place in the local Y, W. this year.
Regular weekly meetings will be
given over to programs in the inter-
est of world understanding. These
meetings will be devoted in part, at
least, to the conduct of a “Mediter-
ranean Tour” which will familiarize
Crinnell students with the manners,
customs and ideals of other nations.
Miss Lewis studied of world problems
in connection with her peace caravan
tour the past summer and thus is
qualiﬁed for the conduct of this de—
partment,

An extensive program has been an—
nounced by the peace committee of
which Marcie Cabalan is chairman.
“Education and agitation" will be
the aim of the committee in dealing
with contemporary problems involv—
ing the establishment of world peace.

Members of the peace committee
will confer with faculty members
conversant in international affairs to
collect a large body of information
on peace problems. They will also
continue the work of last year's de-
partment by establishing peace clubs
in various high schools in this part
of the state. Speaking before

A large percentage of 'Grinnell's
679 students were either in Des
Moines this afternoon or were leav-

Although the game kept Dibble up
to its perfect percentage of victor-
ies, it paved the way for a possible
loss in the future for Langan, their
strongest rivals, because of the loss
of Eddie Brown,' one of Dibble’s co-
captains. Brown suffered a strained

ably be out for the season.‘

‘Artists Need Educational Background,’
Says Taft; IS Optimistic of Present

“The trouble with most artists, is
their lack of an educational back»
ground." said Lorado Taft, sculptor
and lecturer on art.'following up a
quick exclamation of. "Oh! why
not?” when asked after his lecture
Tuesday if any art would emerge
from the colleges of today. "There
are plenty of people today who have
a certain amount of facility and
skill. but do not realize that the
training of the mind must accom-
pany the training of the hand."

Through college education, he said,
the aspiring artist receives a com-
bination of the cultural and the prac—
tical, In Yale especially is this be-
ing achieved, and many of the Prix
de Rome in the recent years have
been won by Yale students.

Pursued with the question of what
kind of art was emerging, he replied,
with a grimace as enthusiastic and
infectious as his smile, that some of
it was “pretty awful", “There is
never any good," he said, “in an af-
fectation of naivete. Most of this
modernism is merely people of intel—

ligence talking baby talk. But be-
cause it is grotesque and dispropor»
tioned, it does attract attention.
“However there is much that is
ﬁne being done,” he went on. "These
are great times to live in! There
are so many doors open to young
people interested in art today,
Easel painting in a studio with no
deﬁnite market is apt to become dis-
couraging. But‘there has been a
great increase in demand for prac-
tical art. Opportunities in architec-
tural modelling and decoration and
in monumental art give special
incentive,”
l He cited also the recent exhibition
in New York of modelling in ivory
soap. This is a ﬁeld of modelling
in which there is awakening interest
and which is accessible to all, rich
or poor/There are really some beau-
tiful and exquisite things being done
in it, you know," he ended, with a
reassuring smile.
‘ “But I’m a born optimist, any—
way," he added. “These are great
times to live in.

Building Three, Building Four and

week after next. In that round, two
of them will compete, while a third

Arguing on the question, “Resolv-
ed, that dictatorship is justiﬁable,"
Building Three's affirmative team,
composed of Randall Kleml—ne and
Rudolph Schlank were given a close
decision over Langan hall by Miss
Verna Crubbs, judge. Edward
Brownbridge acted as chairman.
Building Three was the only af-
ﬁrmative team to win. however, as
Clark defeated Smith by upholding
the negative, and Four defeated Dib-
ble arguing on at side of the question
also. Lee Alexander and Lee Help
son debated for Four, while George
Van Nostrand and Patsy Ferrara up-
held Dibble's fortunes. For Clark’s
negative team, Richard Phillips and
Al Johnson debated. opposing Robert
