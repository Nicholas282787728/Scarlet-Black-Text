’2 4 Writes

of War, Track Meets, and Fruit

The lollowmg is a continuation or a
letter irom Follesl Chapman. who is
teaching- and coachi . athletics at
Ginnollnlrtluu» in which he gives
an accent oi a journey he“
'takes uith his team irom
Tslnau to take part in an athletic con-
tcst. The ﬁrst part oi the letter was
puhlished in the Scarlet and Black lasl
week.

"We carried ollr own rood as we
never trust Chinese food iii the hot
season We ate in a great cau-
yon just helow the rantous old cave.
The walls oi the cmuoll are covered
with inscr‘ tious to the gods and
the slnlldin" Budda appeared as many
as to times The marvellous part
or these, inscriptions on the walls or
the canyon is that they seem to he ill
plaees entirely inaccessihle except by
suspension tram the top oi the canyon.

The temple was a lovely little place
with its gods and carved stone and
tea yard. hut it was so dark in the
canyon we couldn't take pictures. I
shall never forget the quaint and char-
acteristic heauty or the place.

That night the tailor came to the
house and we haggled for lny new suit.
it was great sport and quite a novel
experience. He tinally agreed on
our price.

Sunday 1 visited the iamous huh.
ling springs oi Ts ran and was just in
time to hear an old priest chant one
or his torty vel'se times to the deity
and drink the sacred water. The
shrine was tilled with women having
their tortunes told under the eyes
of the god hurnlug the little prayer
papers before the deity. The most
striking thing ahout these places to
me is the dllst that always covers the
god and everything in the temple.
China is dusty and it means nothing
to the natives to polish up their gods.

W'e spent Monday morning shopping
and then took rickshaws to the station.
We just made our train and again we
rode third class because'it is hy tar
the most fun. it took three coolies
to carry our purchases to the train for
when one goes to the city n China one
trys to buy all the supplies tor all
the foreigners tor two or three months.
This hox car in which we rode home
had a plank along each side tor a seat
so we were in comparative eomtort.

teachers in the girls' school) knit on
a bright red sweater much to the wall-
der and amusement of the gaping
crowd at natives who stood around us.
They do thilnr we are so runny—and
perhaps we are.

Just before we reached Techow we
discovered a Mr Him who had gone to
Grinnell from Porter. He spoke Ellge
lish quite well and we had a tine visit
with him. it nlw. s seems strange
to me to meet so many Grinnellians
out hereisooo miles from Grinnell.
or course it is the most natural thing
in the world that we should try to get
together when we can.

Chinese teachers who speaks English
was sitting near me and could trans.

I had expected a rather quiet stretch
from then until Christmas but things
didn't turn out that way. War con—
ditions grew worse. Train service
became more and more questionable.
Mail and ireight came atter a fashion.
They began to drait men and carts
into service so that our servants were
afraid to go on the street without a
card trorn us (the people out here are
very kind in respecting the wishes and
needs of the foreigners) and once on
the street they sometimes iound no
one in sight. the men all having con-
cealed themselves so as to avoid heing
impressed to the service. The women
were afraid to keep the shops open tor
tear the soldiers might loot. When
we rode horseback ollt to the sure
rounding viliiages we otten saw the
men running to hide until they dis-
covered we were not soldiers coming
to take them. It is pitltul to see them
living in shell tear. it makes one

was dark and we saw them by moon-
light. All along the road we met men
carrying shovels. Some were return-

work. others were on their way to
the trenches to put in their time the
next day. As soon as it got dark,
however, they dissappeared in the vil-
