Again it is held that we get closer-
touch by knowledge of ideas, that is!
we recognize mind wiiere wc ﬁnd‘
ideas. "his criterion is not ﬁnal hei

minds there,
according to Professor Hocking. labor
under the assumption that We know
What other minds are, and have ztrl
ideit of them before. The presence of
the idea of other minds implies that
other minds are real.

Appeal to Experience

The next consideration is an appeal‘

to experience where do we ﬁnd
minds in our own experience? This
question was developed by Professor
Hocking as follows: The locus or the
mind is' with objects to which you are
attending for they are the contents
at your consciousness. We ﬁnd other
minds in these contents and we only
know them in respect to their con-
tents. This tact puts us on the scent:
knowing things in nature as common‘
objects is the point to which we must
attend. Our space goes on to all in—
nnity and we keep in each other":
The only possibility in social
life is that space and its contents have
been common property. Thus We
know nature from the slart‘to he
apart from ourselves and the common
property of us all and out 01' this as—
sociation all other association grows.

The question which naturally lol-
lows is; “What is there about nature
which means other minds than our
own?” Subjective idealism points in
the right direction What is in the
world is in the contents of the mind
and what is making nature is making
me. To cut or: would be to cut off
consciousness. Nothing can hound
sell except selt; space is limited by
space: judgment displaces judgment:
mind limits mind. Thus we are der
pendent on another self. We have
found our other self with nature.

Nature Language or God.

Nsture then is the egress or the
other mind to me. It has to he the
contents of both minds at once: How--
ever, this conclusion leads us to the
belief that some other force enters in
to create nature.

"Nature is the language on God"
We know
God ﬁrst and fellows afterwards.
We have an adea of other minds he-
csusc of this knowledge of God, He
is as near to us as our sensations.

We begin lite as anlmists and we
have to learn that some things are
dead. The world is together at first
and the degree of independence is
slowly built up.
this view or the world makes. We
have discovered the presence of a
great spirit in the world, a great mind
coextensive with nature, It means
everything that exists has a meaning
for it: only exists as it has/d meaning
to the great spirit. This meaning is
