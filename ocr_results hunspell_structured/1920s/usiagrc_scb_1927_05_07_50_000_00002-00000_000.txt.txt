WE THANK YOU. ' E

Grinnell has heen host this weekend to representa»
tires of high school brown and college brains, to the
twentieth annual lnterscholostio Track and ﬁeld meet
and the eleventh annual convention of the Iowa college
Pres's association. Though this is not intended as a
eulogy at the grave of either gathering, now that they
are over, the SCARLET and BLACK hopes that both have
oeen successlul and that the representatives al the high
schools, colleges and universities which were guests at
G‘rinhell will take home a favorable impression of the
Pioneer among lowa colleges. urinnell will [eel that the
time, effort and money expended have beeh‘justiﬁed it
either the track meet (and may we hope both) or the

' press convention has been successtul in the minds of
those attending.

Unlike a Legion carousel, the press convention was
,ior an exchange or ideas and a collection ot intormotion
which will go for the betterment 01 college journalism
and? student opinion in the various educational institu—
tions which the delegates represent. Though no Violent
upheavals in the Iowa scandal sheets will make them»
selves apparent, an improvement will prohahly he notice-
ahle. '

The interscholcstic meet is sponsored by the Honor
G club or Grinnell as a further incentive to competitive

high school athletics and also to unearth new material
for future Griiinell track stars. Though this phrase is
oitcii repeated, Grilinoll is known as the “grcdtest little}
track college in the West," in spite of the exceptiohs|
which the visiting journalists may take to the statement.l
The college does oiier an exceptional opportunity to thei
high school man who want to make a nttme for himsell
in athletics and at the sain'c time ahsorb the culture of a
liberal arts education in an institution where he will not
be swallowed into oblivion by a greater number of stu~
dents. Grinnell is one of the larger colleges, comparing
well uith Bowdoin, Amherst llnll Dartmouth. IL is smdll
when compared with it university, out it has other mlr
vantages which more than offset this apparent one as
seen by the uninitiated.

We hope that this may not he the last visit that any
or the college, university or high school guests here this
week-end pay to Grinhell.

HOW ABOUT A CAMPAIGN!

A college newspaper editor is called upon to rant and
rare upon the seeming inability of students to compre-
hend the real reason for their presence in college, upon
the lack of under-standing between what he considers
secretly to he a fossilized faculty and what he openly
terms a vapid student hody, to attempt to reiorm the
school, to reaffirm the doubting sophomore in his fear
that there is no God, to decry the older generation's
iailnre to understand youth and '“we modems," in tact,
almost everything.

Though we do not wish to coho a trite sentiment,
something which college newspapers never do, we believe
the moment is opportune among this gathering of men and
women who are the most powerful forces in swaying stu-
dent opinion to suggest the voicing of a united sentiment
against war and the military tendencies of the United
States. The college press of Iowa could certainly wield
a powerful influence among students here.

We reier in particular to the situation in China and
dear “Silent Cal," who is glurnly gloating over the pros-
pect of a third term. Not that the immediate prospect of
War may involve this country's young men, but 2m 1m-
perialistic policy, which the present administration seems
in be backing, will, A cabled dispatch Irorn ihe Chinese
Nationalists says in part:

“China is not surprised at England. But the Chinese
are amazed tn see hints that America might cooperate in
the imperialistic crimes of the country against whom she
battled tor her own freedom. ‘

“~but it the American people do not know what is
portending. it they do not desire to have their sons and
brothers the victims of another great world catastrophe
and one in which the friendship
century would he irl-etrievahly los,
people should he on their guard."

Youth has no desire tor war, no desire for Imperial-
ism, no desire for even military training, but it does wish
to he on its guard. There is not a man in Grinnell who
is not thankful that military training is not imposed upon
llini,'and there is not a man in any college who relishes
the idea of continually getting ready for a conflict to
protect “big business.”

't up over_,hnlt a -
What“ the American

we believe that the press of Iowa colleges should
let the world know how we feel about the situation.

NERAL ELECTRIC

More than 60 per cent of the mechanical
power used by American industry is applied
through electric motors. But the electriﬁ—
cation of the tasks performed by man power
has hardly begun. Electric power not only
saves dollars; it conserves human energy for
better purposes and raiSeS standards of
living. College men and women may well
consider how electricity can lessen the bur-
dens of industry and‘ of farm and home life.
