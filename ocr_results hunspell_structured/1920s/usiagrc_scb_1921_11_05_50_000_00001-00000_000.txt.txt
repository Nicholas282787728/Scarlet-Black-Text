DETERIVEINATION TO WIN
.- PUTS PEP INTO CAMPUS

Twenty—one Pioneer warriors left
here Thl ~sday night determined to re-
turn th the scalps of the Kansas
Aggies on their belts after their game
with that strong aggregation today.
As the train pulled out the echoes of
the band and of trainping feet could
he heard a few blocks up the street
where' the whole student body had
turned out to do their heros homage
but owing to the slowness of some-
one's Waterbury the procession arriv-
ed only in time to see the tail lights
of the last car disappearing in the
distance.

Plenty of Fight

The Scarlet and Black goes into the
game to-day expecting one of the
toughest games of the season but they
are also going prepared to put up a
real battle. On the whole the team
goes to Kansas in good condition.
Whltehill is once more back in the
line up and it is hoped, will be able to
be back at the pilot position again
to-day. Walters, although lame, is
nevertheless being taken along and
may he able to play.\ In all liklihoodi
Captain Markley, who has been out.
of the game nearly all this season,
will be back at his old fullback job.
These men should be able to put the
backﬁeld in prime condition once
again.

The line will remain practically the .
same as before except~ that Richards
may be used at left end. Three men,
Slinker, Richards and Macy'are being,
taken on the trip and it is in doubt}
which will fill the left end position.

The early start which the team got,
by leaving Thursday should give them}
ample time to enter the game in prime
ﬁghting condition. A victory over
Kansas would raise the standing of
the Pioneers in Missouri Valley cir-
cles considerably becaue the Aggies
are one of the strongest teams in the
conference this year.
