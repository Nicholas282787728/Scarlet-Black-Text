Machine Invented to

Will John be a doctor or an author,

A new machine to measure his abllle
ties, mbulate them, and average them,
has been designed by Prof, Clark L.
Hull oi the psychology department or
the University of Wisconsin.

“To aid vocational guidance,“ ole»
clared Professor Milli, “we have develr

comhine the test scorcs in one way
and run them through this machine to

The machine then combines them in
another way to determine his abilities
in other directions."

“LITTLE ROBINSIN CBUSOE."

It's a long way from wooden
shoes, dykes, canals, windmills, and
the hitter cold of the winter that
visits the Flemish countryside to the
cocoanut palms, banana trees and
straw tbachcd huts oi an eternally
baking South Sea isle, but that's the
jump Jackie Coogan has taken be-
tween “A Boy of Flanders" and his
newest Melro»Goldwyn picture, "Little
Robinson Crusoe," which comes to the
Colonial Theatre Wednesday and
Thursday

Jackie as the modern, juvenile
counterpart oi the hero oi Daniel De-
foe’s book, "Robinson Crusoe,” has a
glorious time in his newest role. The
story was written expressly for Jack-
ie by Willard Mack, and tens oi an
orphan of a San Francisco police hero
embarking on a tramp schooner, hound
for Australia. The ship goes down
in a tropical typhoon and all on board
are lost except Jackie, who subse~
qucntly finds himself cast up on a
South Sea island, his only companion
the ship‘s cat, whom he dubs "Fri-‘
day." ,

The amazing experiences and ML
venturcs oi the boy and his cat on
the island populated chieﬂy by na-
tive blacks. provides a story entirely'
at variance with any or those which:
have thus tar served as starrins veJ
hicles for the tiny genius. The ap-
neal or the iilm is wide, and was pro-
{duccd as entertainment tor the whole
family. It was supervised by Jack

to that question can be seen in the
picture. “Daddies," the comedy drama
or bachelor life, replete with hilarious
incidents that augur ill for the peace
oi conﬁrmed bachelors.

"Daddies," the newest Warner Bros.
Classic or the Screen, will be shown
at the strand Theatre, on Thursday.

“TRUE AS STEEL”

Rupert Hughes has discussed 8. dar-
ing theme cleverly, subtly and in,
original manner in his latest cinema,
production, "True As Steel," now‘
showing at the strand theatre. The
result is one or the most entertaining
pictures of the year. i

The tamous author—director has
touched on the problems or the wom—
an in business, her temptations, and
her dangers. But he does not take
the attitude of the reformer who says:
”This is bad." He merely presents
the condition as he sees it. and, does

not attempt to offer a solution.

The title, "True As Steel" is taken
from a subrtitle in the film, in which
the business woman, asked by the
“other man" it she loves her husband,
says:

“1 am as true as steel to him. Steel
bends—but always returns to the
straight when the pressure is releas-
ed."

The story is told without the use of
melodrama, lurid situations or a sun»
er abundance of hokllm.

Aileen Pringle, the Goldwyn dia-
cnvery, whose work in (he Dictuﬂzd.‘
tion of Elinor Glyn's “Three Weeks"
started her on the why to fame. en~
hances her record of film achieve-
ments with the leading part in "True
As Steel." Huntly Gordon, in the

From the ministers she learned more

‘has been puzzled at the university by
hearing her instructors would "jump

found that they expect you to "catch

was odd toherbutnot more odd than
the phrase or "knock 'em tor a row
