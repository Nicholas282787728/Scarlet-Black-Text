Scanty Dope Indicates a Hard
Struggle With Southern
Rivals Satudday.

Coach Elwar-d will take his ioot-,
ball squad to St. Lours tomorrow tori
the lirst hiissor i valley gamc oi the

, season against 1 'ashingtou Universityl
on Saturday alternoon. The Pioneers-
should be able to make a good show—
ing in this contest, attcr- the exper—
ience at the game with parsons and
the scrimmage with the Fl'ush last
night.

Tbc'mcn came through the Par-sons,
game without injury and will present
on intact llllerup against Washington
Saturday. The backfield comlliuztr
tion of‘C. Kingcr-y. Crltchett, Winer
and Sweet seemed to work with fall‘
success in last Saturdays game and
it rs probable that these men will start
the game against the Plkels. Tay-
lur and .Scharnu cbcr looked the best
at the wing positions against Par-I
sons. They may start playing
for Griuncu in this week's game. Cap-
tain Nichols and Duke will play tuckr
leg while the guard positions will bc'
filled by Wood. and Dare or Cathr
cart. The latter has been changed,
{rum cnd during this Week's practice;
and seems to show promise oi making!
good at the guard po. ion. Both‘
Grimes and Cushmau will probably be
used. at center. Mortar seems to have
recovered from his injury last week
and may also ﬁgure in the gum.

Washington Univ-crsity has rnad'c ar
change in its coaching stair this'
tall and the football squad rs now in,
charge oi Wimbcrly and Davis. Wire-
ncrly has charge oi the-line while
Davis instructs the backticld. Alrl,
though the ’Pikcl‘s lost several men
from last year's squad, ten letter men
atic in school and will race the Plo-‘
users this week. The line is fairly'
heavy, averaging about lso pounds,
The backﬁeld is not so heavy, but
is, reported to be iast.

Just how these two teams will stack
up when they most is hard to deter-
mine. Washington played its ﬁrst
game or the season lest week against]
the holla School of Mineswlnniug by
a score or 7 to 0. There is couser
quently no direct method oi CDll‘bI
paring thc strengh oi the two teams
that wll meet this Saturday. Grin-
nell won from the Pikers last ‘ycar
by the score of 16 to o. Consideringr
the lact that the southerncrs willA
present nearly a. complete veteran;
line-up, the dope seems to point to a
close, hard fuught garnc. 1
