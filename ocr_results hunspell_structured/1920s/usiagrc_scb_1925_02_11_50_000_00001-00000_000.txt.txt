Schedule: Jnyllawkcrs Tonight,

The Pioneer basketball iivc will
wind up its strenuous trip tonight
'when it clashes with Kansas and it
will then return home barely in time
to play hosts to the invading Dkliv
homa quintet which is taking its first
swing into lowa.

Coach Allen's Jayhnwkers have been
playing a wonderful game since ,they
met the unexpected reverse at the
hands of the Kansas Aggies. and il
Grinuell can register a win tonight
she will be doing better than many of
her followers expect.

However, Coach Black's mon have
been improving steadily and the Kan—
sans will .not trounce them as' de—_
cisively as they did in the opening
game. The Pioneer attack is much
stronger as there is more and better
forward material to work with Moran.
Grimell’s scoring ace, since Gar Lamb
has become eligible and Chase and
Doltlug have improved. The Crlnnell
squad has met with two reverses on
its trip, both of which were hard
fought games, and consequently it
will not be in good physical condition
for the iayhawkers.

' Dope Looks Good

The Oklahoma five which meets the
Scarlet and Black here Friday night.
was counted as one ofthe strong con-
tenders in the valley but on companl
atlve scores it is not ’on a par with
Crinnell. The Sooners lost to No-
'hraska 31 to 17 while the Pioneers
bowed to the Cornhuskers 35 to 20.
Although dope is uncertain this would
indicate that ‘Gn'nnell will move up a

‘little in the percentage column hi»
day night.

The Oklahoma team is much to be
feared, however, as it has two classy
scorers in McBride and Rupert. in
addition to a well balanced team.
Washington and Nebraska are the on-
ly teams which have beaten the Soon-
ers this year so Captain Gelvin and
his men have a job on their hands.

beclares Christlanity
Is a Life. Not a Crecd

President Main. by way of pl‘eparar
tion for the Fosdick lectures, spoke
at the Mbuday— morning chapel on the
Sublect oi’ “Religion and Life Values,"
“To most people." president Main
said, "religion is l-nei‘ely a belief in a
_ system of doctrines reduced to a
creed," Then, he went on to explain‘
that no religion was a true one unless
it dealt with life values, "For Jesus
ignored creed and preached life." A
Christian's life to President Main
means, "identification with Jesus
Christ." Religion to him is a magic
cal expresion of "the inner desire to
. unify the spirit we call God.” These
are the things that give eternal value
and distinction to a person's life.

Lambly should make a good showing

in the quarter, Britton is a fine hair
miler and Dalbey is one or the best
pole vaulters in the state, Ames will

Beginning Sunday, February six-

concerning the Fosdick addresses
which are being given at present. The
house chairman of each building, as
sisted by seniors, will invite a laculty
member to preside at each meeting.
These faculty members will be guests
of honor at tables occupied by mem-

are to conduct the discussion groups.

The discussions will cover the en-

making one discussion on each Sun-

weeks. Aside from the informative
value to he gathered from the general
discussion, it is expected that this will
also provide an excellent manner of

GHINNELL LﬂSES TI'III‘
GAMESMAGE TITIP

Noln'aslfa and Kansas Aggics Defeat
I’ionoer Bum Squad in Two
Mud-fought Games. ' ‘

The Gr‘innell cagers lost to the N34
braska five Monday night by the score
of 36 to 29. in one of the hardest games
played on the Combusker floor this
season, The gam‘e was a heated ar-
gument throughout and although at
the half the score was 20 to 11, the
Pioneers threatened several tunes to
so into the lead.

The score was tied in the first half
at 2 all and 9 all and ll Was the ability
to sink free [055% that kept the Scar-
let cagers in the running, The
first five points were all via the free
throw lane and it was not until the
game was ten minutes old that Moran
shot the first field goal which made
the score 8 m 7 with Grinnell on the
short end.

Gelvin and Moran were the out-
standing stars in the Pioneer lineup.
Galvin was high pointer of the game
with five free throws and three bas-
kets and Moran counted four goals
and a free toss.

The Nebraska. scores were Widely
scattered with every man but the
back guard getting one or more goals.
They seemed to have little difficulty
in penetrating the Griuuell defense
and many of their baskets were from
within ’the ‘foul line area.

her it it was true. The spinster re-
plied that it wasn't true but that she
thanked God for the rumor, anyway.
“It isn’t true that rm the best quali-
fied man in the world to speak on this
subject, but I am grateful for the me
mor, anyway."

The noted easterner referred to
Grinncll as the school "of whom ev—
erybody is speaking well" and quoted
a graduate oi another iowa insti
'ution as culling Crinnell ”the
best thing in the state." In place of
speaking a few words concerning how
glad he was to address a Griunell
audience, Mr. Fosdick told a story
about a man who was traveling about
with a side show exhibiting a moose.
The man was asked one day by a fel-
low with a large family if ,he could
have a rebate from the usual charge
of ten cents. “How many of you
are therol" the exhibitor asked, “My
wife and fourteen children," was the
reply. "Come right in, sir, it's just
as important for my moose to see your
family as it is for your family on see
my moose."

Distorted View:

in taking up his case to p :
religion is an inevitable factor in life,

Vthe great liberallst's avowed purpose
was "to take up one by one the con-
stituent elements that make up the
life of man and prove that these coir
stituent elements are not completely
developed without religion." By way
of introduction to the body of his
talk, Fosdick took up some of the
principal distorted views of religion,
namely: that religion is a suppression.
of lite, a case illustrated by Brigham
Young's brother who did not smile
for four years; that religion is an ad—
dition to life to be taken up like stamp
collecting or cross—Word puzzles; and
that religion is but'a shining up of
the old superstitions.

I The first element of man which
Fosdick discussed was joy. "Fullfill-
ment of life is the fullfillment of joy.
Joy is the hall-mark of health," he
said. Then, for the purpose of dis~
cussion, he asked the audience to sup-
pose that there was no God; that life
was merely a combination of eighty
odd chemical elements; that there was
no spiritual life at the heart of this
cosmos; that those who claimed to
have found God in nature were fooling
themselves; that the saints were mis-
taken, “Something has happened to
happiness. We have a conviction
that at the very center of life is Go
that there is purpose behind it. and m —
tory ahead of it. We Christians ought
to be the happiest people on earth, We
believe that the earth is not a drifting
raft but a strong ship with a stalwart
captain." Arguing in this manner,
lir. Fosdick drew the obvious conclus—
ioll that religion is it necessary part
of happiness.

The next element which he took
up was conscience. AS a. man grows
older he outgrows the fear of what
pco le will say about him; the tear of
accidents, and oven the fear of death,
,the most exciting adventure of life.
[Yet, a man ought never to outgrow
lthe fear of conscience for it is the

thing nearest to the eternal judgment
seat within us. "Can a conscience

lllke that," Fosdick asked, “exist in an

irreligious world? The moral life of
luau can not be at home in an irre-
religious world."

"God Was new Hm!”
He took up the common fallacy of
lbellevlng that “map has invented God
!and merely projected him upon «he
,screen of the universe. It is like he-
lieving that moving branches

The display warrants'cause the wind since the wind blows

,when the branches move. No! The
wind came ﬁrst. So God was there
I f irst and our moral lll'e ls response to
r it,” The great liberal concluded.
then that religion Was necessary in
the moral life of man.

Mlle was the next element that he
‘ discussed, "plaln, everyday, human
love.” He spoke a! Walking down the
a few Stralns of

family in the individual" whichlmuslc which he immediately recogn-

ized as a portion of Chopin's Nocturne.
