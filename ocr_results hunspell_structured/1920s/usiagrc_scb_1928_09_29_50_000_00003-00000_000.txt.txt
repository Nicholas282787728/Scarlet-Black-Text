Lamb Penetrates
African Continent

Grinnell Graduate Describes His
Tour Through Dark Africa.

Word was received during the sunk
_ mer from Cul'lis Lamb, who is teach—
ing in Anatolia college, ('hd laos, in
Salcnica, Greece, concerning his trip
through Airiea Lamb graduated irem
Gl'innell in the class or 1 and was
sent to Greece tor a period of three
years to teach in preparation inc 1 s
in journalism.

He is traveling with Alden Greene.
who graduated in 1926 and who is
teaching in Egypt. An extract or
Lamb's letter describing the trip role
lows:

"Bodi'ding; the Gordon paslm at
Khartoum, we iuuuediately headed ill—
to the liihitc Nile branch or halo el

' d, stopping at Kosti, Jebeleiu.
Reap. Kukzt, Kodak and ilnlakal. Now,
however large any any of these places
may loom on the. map you must ini—
ngine them as little villugés about the
size or Kellogg, situated on the ban s
of a winding meadow r er, and with
houses oi straw with peaked roots
built over a structure of bamboo. cin-
pilot again chose a branch oi tlie'Nilc
at ilalanal. and we steamed east to
Lake No, then south on the ham e1
Jehel, calling at Bar, Tombe, and just-
this morning at lliongalla. Each or
these villages is a military training
and trading post on the edge of the
jungle, troni which at times a crouch—
ing lion may steal upon some unpro-
tected water carrier; or a couple or
elephants may emerge some sort
spring night to trample over some
carefully planted vegetation.

This ctvilizlng process reminds me
of the story told us by' a certain Mrs.
James Davy of New Yorlt’ last night,
"A sweet young thing from the biggest
city had gone out west for her unl~
varsity work. \Vandering across the
campus one day, she found a bona
fide Indian souaw sitting on the steps
of one of the halls. Greatly interested
in this phenomenon, she approached
m ask, ‘Are you civilized? We, are
you'." was the reply. This story came
after l had just remarked to Mrs.
Davy that after viewing the true
Atrican savages, one begins to think
that alter all we are really civilized
in the states.

Fear that the great ‘Sudd block
which has lasted tor two months and
a halt would hold us up, was dis»
pelled only two days before we arriv-
ed when the channel was cleared of
papyrus plants and mother-of—hair,
and the Gordon pasha is the lirst heat
to make the trip through the regular
channel.

And just to cap it all and make us
sing, "on boy, he happy, I'll say I'm
happy," there's the chance telegram
which Davy’s driver sent from Rejaf
last night. It is the chance ot the lite-
time, that at seeing the equator region
from our own car. Davy paid the man
well ior hoth coming and going, and
we therefore tigure we should he able
to hargain well, with him.

Best of luck,
