Is what every ambitious senior is
thinking about at the present time,
Life insurance is one of the best, one
of the most desirable, and one of the
most satisfactory as a permanent
calling.

In assets and volume of business,
life insurance is one of the three lead—
ing‘businesses of this country, yet the
ﬁeld is comparatively under—developed.
Only 7 per cent (if the economic valué
of human life in the United States is
covered by insurance. This gives an
idea of the big? ﬁeld still to be worked,
especially business insurance for ﬁrms
and corporations.

As to ‘ remuneration: Reports of
college graduates who have entered
business indicate that life insurance is
'at the very top as a source of income.
Now is the time for you to consider
what you are going to do after gradu—
ation. If you are ambitious and will—
ing to work hard and are interested
