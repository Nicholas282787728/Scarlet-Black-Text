THE EDUCATIONAL DILEMMA.

Everett Dean Martin in his “Meaning of a Liberal
Education" mnlies rather then. reference to the
mania for education existing in this country no\\'. Cor»

‘ respondence courses, extension divisions, cluttered eur-
ricnlnnis, andlldd aid society lecture programs are
the result. Education is sought as a tangible something
which obtains quickly, painlessly, and with little effort.

The evidences of this feeling abound in the advertis-
ing sectcns of oilr perodicals, which portray very graphi-
cally the dollar down and a dollar a week method of
acquiring a reading knowledge of French in twcnt
hours, or the social necessity of investing in certain
shelves of books in order to escape the ignonliny of
ignorance.

: r. Martin perceives that there is a great diircrence
between true education and this so~callerl, or pseudo-
educutlon. Where many people point to our many mon-
grel types of educational processes, and ﬁre-ﬁgured
enrollments as indicative of an unprecedented culture and
progress, Professor Martin is conservative and even
dubious.

Are we not faced with an educational dilemma? 0n
the one hand we have a democratic countly clamoring
for a. high standard citizenship, which, it is correctly
thought, can only he obtained through education. The fol.
lacy is that they believe education is merely ft process, it
fol‘lnaiit' and have no conception at it as a growth, an

inciitubly lcd to our present tendency to clicapcii, shorten,
and popularize edllciitiun. Mr. Martin indicates the result
01 this \‘eiltul’ciit loss oi renl scholarship, a suci- '
tllc generative ioi-ces of true education, and a lo.
intellectual ‘lcndcrship. This is one horn oi our
dilemma.

incur the wholesaler titll of a people which pitiiilei-s

environment, and public demand. it is important to the
educational progress or the country, and to the success
of the school in solving its speciﬁc problems that it decide
for one course or the other, and that it remove itself from

The (realisation has been made, not once, but often,
that the college is turning out students who are an '
Alllel‘ie'flns. This stﬂtclnent‘i‘epl‘esents the dissatisftttyl
Lion of fill older group in town and suggests the fige.oltl%
town and gown strllggle~2t struggle of which Grinnell;
has always been singularly free, These critics‘ go on tel
add that their children hear nothing but aims!) of the:
present United States government in their College nlzisses‘i
and that it is impossible to attend a lecture in the collegel
chapel where the American government is not condemned‘
and the government of Russia, China, 01' smile other
foreign nation ldlldefl.

 

We would question thisnccusatiou. It is not a marl:
of intelligence to have advanced beyond the stage of being
ruled by such shibholeths as “100% American" and
Stephen Decatur s ramous “right or wrong, my eountl'y!"l
We believe that one may criticize his government, undel'el
stand its shortcomings, realize where another country he, ,
more sllccessfnlly handled certain problems, but at the
some time remain a good citizen with constructive ideas
at the service or his community.

The remarks about talks at the chapel seem to us
ridiculous. it is true that at many, the methods used by
other countries in solving common problems have ’been
explained a‘nd our country urged to adopt the same innovl
rations. But these suggestions are always made in the.
spirit of progress, not with the view of wilfully tearing
down what these critics would call, “thc sacred instilli-
tions of our country." What if this college generation
does criticize the government? \Ve believe it means that
because we are interested in these questions brought to
our attention in class and public lectures and are anxious
to see them peacefully and eiiiciently solved, we are
developing a student group of higher intelligence who, be-
cause of this some critical faculty. will he better citizens.
