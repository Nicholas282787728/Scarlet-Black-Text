THE QUESTION
“'lmt would you suggest as or fitting
national memorial for Wodl'mr ‘
Wilson.

Tm: ANSWERS
Willard Ii. Sperry, dean of the HELP
vord divinity school: Woodrow Wil-
Isou all his life reflected the interests
and the activities of college and uni-
versity; any memorial which would
be fnitbiul to his spirit ought to be
something which would keep his ideals
alive and spread them. Some endow—
ment which can be used to make pos-
sible the interchange of ideas between
university, facility, and students, on
this side and in Europe, would he a

fitting memorial.

Evelyn M. Boyd, instructor in Eng-
lish: As a right and fitting tribute
iroin the American people to the meni-
ory of the life and the ideals of Wood-
row Wilson the cathedral in which
be now lies might be completed by
means of popular subscription; inter-
ment in the cathedral to be America's
signal merit of honor and appreciation
for a life spent in her inteests.

Bel-hart] Crave : if a League of Na-
tions is ever consummated, 1 think a
‘signiticant memorial to Woodrow Wil—,
son would be to call it the Wilson
League of Nations, since he was its
inspiration, If srich an ideal is never
:reachcd, a building similar to the Lin—
coln memorial should be erected to'
perpetuate the name of one of the‘
greatest innirers of some of our grcavl
est lllslol'l‘.
l Hairy Reynold 1 thinlr that some
national organization that has bran-
ches should send resolutions to head ,
quarters recommending Wilson. This
organilqtionsbonld be big enough to

 

actcr, sincerity and unscitishness, .7
side from their personal prciridiccsl
and opinion regarding him.

.tlicc llnycsi I lllillk the most fitting,
and feasible memorial to Woodrow"
Wilson would be the entrance of the
United stntcs into \l'orltl aifnirs ac—
cording to the Bali peace plan.

mclinrd Sloilltll': The greatest iiioni.
orial to Woodrow Wilson would he thel
unqualified entrance of the United
states into the League of Nations. l
It would he more fitting that his ideals
he maintained and realized than the
erection of a marble shaft, over which
the United states Senate inight shedr
it's crocodile tears.

Piud lllnchachron, dean of men: I‘
think in view ot'the very close syrup—i
athl’ which Mr. ll'ilson had for the
college and university, his memorial'
should be some kind of an institute Ol’
deportment of a great university work-
ing along lines of international law
and the federation of nations.
