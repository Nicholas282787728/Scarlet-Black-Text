“Novel Plan” For
Future Meetings

The freshmen seem to think that
"turn obout’s fair play". Several
weeks ago a meeting was held when
only the men were present. After
searching in rain [or the fair coeds
the meeting was forced to adjourn.
Wednesday evening, through all mis-
understanding, the gi s all assembled
but not a man was in sight. Perhaps
the members or the class do not care
to meet together, but would prefer to
have separate class meetings for man
and for girls This is an entirely
new idea. Vii - not,ad01)t it?
