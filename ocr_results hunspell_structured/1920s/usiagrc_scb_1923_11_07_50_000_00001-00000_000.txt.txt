Eddy Tells of Condiﬂons

Mr. Eddy, who is a’member 01'
the Ainerican'noard of Foreign .
sions, has spent the last seventeen
years studying world situations. Dur—
ing the past year he did intensive re-
search work on conditions in China
He spoke three years ago at the chap—
e1 service for the Crinnell—in—Chins
drive. .

"Since I was here three years ago,"
he said, "A great event has changed
the entire outlook of China. The
Washington Conference has given
China a new chance. has released the
clutch of Japan, and has strengthened
the scope of American influence."

According to‘ Mr. Eddy. a report
under the direction of Elihu Root, one
‘0! the United States commissioners
at the conference, shows that 220,000
Chinese students are attending Amer-
ican mission schools,

Emphasizes nnportance oi Movement

"This figure does not represent a
drop in the bucket, as some people
argue," declared Mr. Eddy. “It rep—
resents the whole bucket, for the
whole of China’s future centers in
Christian leadership. It is not the
aim of the mission schools to give
everyone a college education, but to
develop character and leadership."

Mr. Eddy told how two pupils
the primary schools could be suppor-
ed for a dollar a year, and how fi

in

The "free association test" was
used in, an experiment perlormcd by
the pschycology department last Wed—
nesday. A certain group "commit—
ted a crime” which consisted of un-
wrapping a package containing a
bottled snake lnbled “King Snake,
Iowa, 1885.”

Following this a group of fifty
simple words were pronounced to the
Whole class and by responding with
words suggested by these, the “guilty"
were singled out from the “innocent."

The following are the Words and
responses of the guilty persons: “not-
tlcesnake; color-brown; scales— hex—
agon; length-yard; lass-Iowa; King
Shake.”

The results of the test given to the
"innocent" members are as follows:
“Bottle—wine; color-bright; scales<
fish; 138541119; length-foot; King -
Queen.”

This same experiment is used in
coults, in diagnoses of insanity, and
by psycho-annulus, accordingto Pro-
fessor Reed of the pschycology dc-
pertinent.

tin-mural sport.

Smith and Limgal’l Halls were sched-

John Kingman Sends Professor
Peck a Piece of Famous
Cambridge Tree.

Prof. Paul F. Peck exhibited the
most recent acquisition to his Collec-
tion of historical relics to his history
classes Monday.

It is a piece of wood from the Wash—
,ington elm which {all last week at
Cambridge, Mass. while workmen
were taking steps to preserve it, John
C. lfingman, ’20, a former pupil of
Professor Peck, who is now doing
graduate work at Harvard, secured the
relic in spite of the eforts of police
to keep back the circle of interested
spectators. ’

The tree is famous for having shad-
_cd the spot where George Washington
took,chal‘ge of the Continental Army
on July 3, 1775. It was one of the
proudest boasts of Harvard students,
being near the campus. The' trunk av
the historic tree has been out into
forty-eight segments, one of which will

STIEE TILT AGAINST
ASSIE PASS ARTISTS

Coaches Have Drilled Pioneers
In Football Fundamentals
for Two Full Weeks.

LINE-UP CHANGES ARE
EXPECTED ON SATURDAY

Comparative Dope Gives Kansans
Edge H Aerial Attack Is
Aggie Favorite.

The Pioneers, with a slightly chang-
ed line-up, will go on the field this
week against the Kansas Aggies with
a spirit and determination to win,
The open date last Saturday has given
coach Elward two full weeks in which
to prepare his men for the Aggie can»
test, and a complete reversal of form
is expected,
Elward has sent his proteges
through a number of scrimmage:
since the Drake contest, and a not-
iceable improvement has been made
in‘ the tackling and blocking elements
of the game. Yesterday afternoon
the props were sent against the var-
sity to give the latter practice in.
breaking up passes, which is consid-
ered the strongest phase of the Aggie
offense.

Lille-up May Change
It'_ is highly probable that a number
of new men may appear in the line-
up this Saturday. Duke has been
shifted to right guard and will play
with Nichols and Winters on that side
oti the line. Wood has been changed
to left tackle, while Catbcart is lili-
ing the guard position formerly held
by Wood. Taylor will continue at
left end. Moyer, who has been in the
game but little this season, will probe
ably start the contest at the center
position. '
In the backfield only one change
has been made.‘ "Calm" Jones. who
showed up so well in the Drake game,
is running the team at quarterback.
Smith and Wing will play halthacks.
and Sweet, fullback. -

C. Klugery, who started the season
at quarterback, has been shifted to
fullback so that he may be able to
take the place of Sweet, if an emel'v
gency arises.

Critchett appeared on the field last
night for the first time since his
injury at st. Louis. It is highly im—
probable that he will appear in the
Aggie contest, but his return to the
gridiron has made the Grinnell stock
rise considerably. Pulfrey, a maln-
stay oi the freshman team last year.
appeared in moieskins yesterday for
the first time‘ this year.

Aggies Hard Dungerous Pass

Kansas has a strong aggregation
this season and the forward pass, as
used by tho Aggies, is especially
dangerous. Ames and Kansas play-
ed a 7 to 7 tie game two weeks ago
and last Saturday Missouri humbled
the Kansas eleven by a 4 to 2 count.
Ames defeated Missouri and Drake
trounced Aines. Consequently the
dope gives.Kansas Aggies a slight ad-
vantage over Grinnell.

The Pioneers are going on the field

Saturday determined to turn back the
Aggies and avenge the defeat adc
mister-ed by Drake on Homecoming
day. The slight advantage which the
dope sheet gives Kansas will only
make the Scarlet and Black warriors
fight the more,
The probable line-up for the Kan-
sas Aggies will he: Weber and Much,
ends; Yandell and Kiefer, tackles;
Steiner and Schindler, guards; Hut-
ton,,center; stock and Clemons, halt
backs; swartz. quarterback: and Ax-
linc, fullback.
