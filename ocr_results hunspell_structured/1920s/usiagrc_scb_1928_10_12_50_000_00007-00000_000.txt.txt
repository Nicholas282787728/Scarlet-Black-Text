Curriculum Changes Explained In
Detail To Student Body And
Alumni This Morning.

‘TO STUDY FRESHMAN CLASS

Purpose Is To Find Out How Much
the Student Has In AbiliVy
And Creative Capacity.

Sneaking before the whole student
body and hundreds of alumni, Pres.
J. H, T. Main delivered the annual
homecoming address in Herrick chap—
el this morning.

“A‘ student who had just finished
the work of a sophomore year in a
college of liberal arts was about to
transfer to the medical school in the
same institution. He had apparently
some misgivings about his fitness for
the transfer. He came to a friend of
mine asking his aid in selecting hooks

to read that might help him in am:

swering some of the questions that
were tioubling him

“\ly friend first suggested Presi
dent Andrew Whites "The Conflict of
Science and Religion. " The youth had
never heard ot this hook. This is not
surprising for it was uii ten two or
three decades ago and might not be
in the peivicw of a teacher unless he
“ere interested in the personal prob
lems of his students. Nevertheless,
the book is a classic and is still up
to date on great underlying princi—
ples, But the lad didn't know uni-thing
about Huxley or Pasteur and had
never read Darwin's "Origin of Spe-
cies." The conversation finally
brought intorl'ellef that fact that this
lad, already on the way to his chosen
life work, in which he would have to
meet people who might expect sym-
pathy and undel‘standingithls youth
knew nothing about the background
of the world in which he was to live
professionally, except its bare techs
nlque.

Cites Typical Cost

“This is not an exceptional case.
It's rather typical. Thousands of oth-
rs no better prepared than the young
man I inn mlking about are entering
‘rofessional schools through which
they are to be given m the world as
men of light and leading. Very well:
They may be good mechanics, but the
world is flooded as it is with new in-
cntlons, new discoveries in science,
new approaches to the meaning of life
and new voyages into the infinities
of the universe, needs men who know
something more than the mechanics
.t their life work.

“The college is a new world~a

orid growing by leaps and hounds
into uncharted and untried fields of
adventure. it must face the situation
It must recognize the fact that the
big and overpopulatcd institutions

We have already an experimental
'course now under way confined to
twenty»live students. Professor Lav-
ell’s work this year with these stu-
dents Will be :t test course and will
furnish the basis on which to empha»
size and expand the Work next year
or later.

“When all freshmen are included
the teaching staff will necessarily
need to be enlarged, by the addition
of instructors selected for the two
qualiﬁcations of personality and
training. Naturally the equipment
wlll be books. Instructors will be
needed for constant supervision and
conference in connection with books
and subjects read.

“A program of this kind carried
out adequately especially if it is pro.
jectetl through the sophomore year,
will he the foundation for a gcnuinc
and efiective junior college. It will
afford a sitting process by which wiil
be determined the fitness of man -
u:tl students for further college work.

“When students have followed this
program for one or two years they
should be able to do their own thinks
ing and should be lil’eplretl as up-
lperolass students~jtlniars and sen-
iors—to give something out in a cre-
ative way. They ought to he ready
[for originality in their own work
even in the face of world momentum
that is against them. When students
are able to do even modest work Sligr
lgestiie of originality and creative
genergy the othci things contributing
to a rich and fiuitful life will natural-
ly follow.

guidance what the individual students

ave in themselves of ability and cre-
ative capacity, rather than to find
out how much they have memorized
