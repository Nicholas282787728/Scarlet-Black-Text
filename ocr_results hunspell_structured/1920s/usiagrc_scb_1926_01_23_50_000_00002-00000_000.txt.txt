According to Mr. Douglass, the phil-

during the latter part. at the nineteen»
tli century and the beginning of the
twentleth century and was not lllllitr
‘ed to the United States but took
place in practically llll parts oi the
world. The feeling of hope at this
time was due to the enormous mater-
ial achievements and advancements of
the period. Production of all kinds

The big problem today is that even,
thinking men are coming to despair
and predict gloomily 0f the future.
Man has become Sort. of a. machine,
and thoughts have become meteriah
istic, niechhnistic and militaristic in
nature.

Mr. Douglass stated that he did not
‘helleve that the philosophy of despair
is caused by the mechanistic view of
Ylire; but rather, by the failure olman
in choosing his course. Men have
:Chosen the material things instead of
the finer and more intellectual things.

By choosing a new Course we shall
be able to create a new philosophy of
hope upon the knowledge of what man
is and what he does. Furthermore,
the choosing of this course depends
