IN RETRUSI’BCT
The time has come [or us to sing
our swan song, fade politely and per—
manently into the background, and
.tahe our place among the baseheens.
Beginning with the next issue, the
Grinnell Scarlet and Black will be
placed in the hands of the new man—
agement.

We have no adequate phrases with
which to express our appreciation oi‘
the general attitude of the campus
toward the Scarlet and Black. We
can wish our successors no better
luck than the continuation of the same
friendly interest, the same spirit of
cooperation on the part of both stu-
dents and faculty. which have made
our year at the helm of the college
newspaper a pleasant one.

As we make our last hour and prop

and

If a. "woman‘s touch“ has some-
times seemed to mould the Grinnell
Scarlet and Black into a Griunell Lad-
ies Home Journal, if our occasionally
persistent treatment or Quadrangle
problems has sometimes made it seem
a woman’s paper, we urge you to re
