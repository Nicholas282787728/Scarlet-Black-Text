President Main, just returned from
the Pacificeoest, where he has been
engaged in meeting of alumni assoe

pointed to the remprkable response
to the appeal on ’the campus, both
from students and faculty members.
He gave further statistics as to the
needs of the college .and the reasons
why the funds should be raised, giv»
ing a few details of the plans on
which the campaign is based.

Mrs. Wilson was the next speaker,
and spoke from the women's point of
view describing the club activities in
making pledges to the extent of near--

showed the effects of the campaign
on the women, in teaching them thrift
and economy in saving their extra
pennies for the college. She urged
the men of the town to do likewise.

Condition Not Realized

J. H. Patton expressed the position
in which a great many of the citizens
of ,Grinnell found themselves, namely
that they did not realize the true tie
nancial condition of the college. Be-
cause of the building operations, and
the general history of the college,
many people thought that Grinnell
was exceptionally rich in endowment,
with enough to keep it in a safe con-
dition throughout the crisis. The
realization that such was not the case
has been a revelation to some, accord-
ing to Patton. Mr. Patton is a strong
believer in Grinnell ,and pledged him—
self to do his utmost to keep the col—
lege in Grinnell. Mr. Patton urged
his hearers to realize that every citi—

Student Council Takes No Ac.
tion on Proposed Re-
organization.

COMMITTEE TO REPORT
SOMETIME NEXT WEEK

No‘ definite action was taken on the
proposed reorganization of the Stud
ent Council Thursday, except to ap-
point a committee to submit pl-ullosr
die for a new constitution. It was
intended to have each member of the
Council submit a plan at the meeting.
but no pipu could be agreed upon and
the body resorted to a Committee. The
committee follows: Ruth Condon,
chairman, Willis hlacy, Harry Flynn,
John Decker, and Susan Saar. The
committee expects 'to submit a new
constitution next week ,cccording to
members.

No, statement could be obtained as
to the plans of the cominittcc, except
that the main problem to be consider-
cd is the manner in which the student
council members shall be chosen, At
present the members are elected by
-classes, but some students think the
committee will report in favor of
choosing the student members with
regard to residence, whether at the
Quad,_dorms. or in town.

To hlcrellso Nilllillers

It is probable that the membership
in the council will be increased from
the present number of twelve to about
[double that number, so that all divi
ions and interests of the campus will
have representation.

The extent to which the council
will have jurisdiction over student ac-
ti 'Iiis and conduct must also be de-
termined by the committee when it
submits its report. Whether the
lwhole organization will he changed
land the Council changed into merely
an advisory body, or whether it will
ask for greater powers-0f govsrllillent,
is another issue to be decided. some
students favor the abolition of the ad-
ilninlsu‘ative phase of are Council, and
jliopc to see it become merely an of—
lficial advisory body. There are a
Ifcw student, who advocate the honor
Isvsfem, with full student jurisdiction
lovcr the operation of the system.

When the committee reports, the
student council will consider the new
constitution and if it approves, will
present the question [0 the student
body for a refercnrli’ini vote.
