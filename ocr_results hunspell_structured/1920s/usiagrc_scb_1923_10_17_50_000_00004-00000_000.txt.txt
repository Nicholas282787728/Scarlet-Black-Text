CYCLONE CUTS COSMETIC CROWD

AND CORRUPTS

This season there will he no hurry
calls for ambulances to rush' drug
store clerks to hospitals; no Grinnell
male students will st‘and mourniullv
about with great watery globules
coursing down their Cheeks—lot the
Cyclone contest will not go to the girl
most adept in the application of the
schoolgirl complexion, nor will it be
restricted to the feminine persuasion,
although feminine persuasion may
play a part in it. _

Believing that corruption can reach
its highest stage only when every one
has a vote to sell, and if possible,
more than one vote to turn into
money, the management oi the Cyr
clone, after consulting the Political
Science department, announces thaCt it

cause or corruption: Everyone (who
invests in a Cyclone next. Week) will
be permitted to cast eight votes, all on
one ballot. The management believes
that this new type at election Will‘be
widely telt~may even shake the
school. students who do not wish to
sell their votes will unquestionably
have great run trying to decide whom
to vote for.

The faculty kindly offered to excuse
classes during the contest in order
that the students might have full time
to make decisions, but the election
promoters declined on the ground that
this leniency on the part of the faculty

might he interpreted as an attempt to
