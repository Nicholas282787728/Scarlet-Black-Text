THE HUMILITY OF KNOWLEDGE.

inside of three days the majority of Grinnell’s
students will be scattered over the United States. They
will go home to their own communities, shining lights
of brilliancy, sparkling and scintillating with the glamour
of a college education (or at least part ct one). Their
friends, relatives and neighbors will speak proudly of
them mid point them out to the less ambitions youth oi
the town as examples to loilow. In accordance with this
procedure, for such it seems to be at every Christmas
vacation, the students will put on their best manners and
clothes in an attempt to carry out the idea

The glamour surrounding a college education is dif-
ficult to undersand for one who has gone to college. After
all how much do you, as a college student, know? Not
verv much. Iii fact the more one attends the institutions
of higher learning, the more he realizes his ignorance
and the more humble he becomes. He comes to know

The plot is woven around Villon's original

it. True. they allot-d the college education that they give.
but what of that education? In most cases it is nothing
more than making high schools last six years instead
or tour. lilost communities cannot atria-ii to secure the
services or the better teachers and they probably could
not got them if they could attord it. 'A continuation or
the lax study methods of high school is going to do a
student no good, nor is the possession of a certiﬁcate
going to prove that one is educated. High schools cannot
have the library lacilitics of a college or university, and
conssuucntly the course at study in Jlml - college must,
in a measure be carried on in the what-did'you-read-in-
yollrrtext manner,

When a student has graduated nnm high school, he
is at the age when he wishes to get on: “into the World," in
other words, to get away from home and to see what he
can do without the rluttcring protection or the parental
wing. Such a desire shows no lack ot love or respect
tor one’s parents; it is merely a state of restlessness
common to persons of the late ’teens. A majority or
students attending Junior college are doing so because
their parents say they must go there or nowhere, with
a resulting dissatislaction on the part of the student
which makes him love his parents less than if he were
away irom home.

Looking at Junior culleges from the point of Grinnell
and other liberal arts schools of similar nature, the
mushroom institutions are a bad thing. Many of those
persons enrolled in the recognized colleges attend them
for the ﬁrst two years and then go to a university to
specialize. The growth of the Junior college will in
time reduce the number at studc s attending the smaller-
of the collegiate institutions which have built up faculties
and educational facilities in general of It very high
quality, but which will be unable to support them if their
ﬁnances are further encroached upon by the Junior
college. R, B. No.

The Scarlet and Block.
Dear sir:

There is a time honored tradition in
Grinnell that has no ﬂpuarerlt excuse
tor existing.‘other than that the com-
placent lethargy of those in power is
more important than the comiort and
convenience oi the common herd. Now
that the cold Weather has come to stay,
this has become a very noticeable
gripe. We speak of the absurd custom
or opening only one door to an rigs
gravated mob of men diners, when zip-
perently, loresoeing tlle need, the ctr-
chitect provided two doors, and the
contractor hung them on perfectly
good hinges, which could be replaced
if the cxtravagent wear or using both
of them at once proved fatal.

Taking ior granted that both doors
will stand the wear and tear of being
opened three times a day, there is yet
another angle to the problem. Who
will pay a man to do this labor at unr
latching both doors? According to the

‘tradition no provision has been made

in the college budget {or this extra
labor. We are certain that it cannot
be included in the duties of he Who up—
ens the one door, for no Grinneiilan
accepts it salary for an unperlormed

»titsl(. However, this zulgle of the prob-

lem is not unsolvabie. We suggest
that the money that will be saved on
the breakage or the gin in the doors,
dlie to present conditions, ought to be
sufﬁcient to induce someone to take
this res‘ponslbllltv. If this is not
enough. pass the hat and we will start
it off with it few dollars.

It would he too much to ask that the
diners be permitted to Wait in the
warm vestibule, though who can tell,
perhaps some brave Soul in ten yeitrs

or so will demand even this consider- W

utlon.
