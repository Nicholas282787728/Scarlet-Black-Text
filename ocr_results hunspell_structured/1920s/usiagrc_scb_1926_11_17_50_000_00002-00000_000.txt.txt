Sir:

We go to chapel and hear a lllllslr

‘ each number we stchdly sit and stare

at tho perrormer like so many senses

The artist, on his part, has nothing to
do between numbers but stand there
and stare back at us. He must he
very iiiicomini-iohle, especially if he is
not used to our Dilssil'e reception.

Is there some liidebound convention
irli ,h res-trains us from applauding in
chapel? Tlie trcslnncn, it seems to
rue, wci-c acting only naturally when
‘dt the first musical chapel of the
year, they made their appreciation
licnrri. Since that one occasion, alp-
plausc has been sadly lacking. The
fact that the musical numbers are pre—
coded by a hymn and followed by u
prayer is no real reason for not clan-
ping, To applaud is natural. I tlliul:
we ii oiilil all lecl better “by not do
