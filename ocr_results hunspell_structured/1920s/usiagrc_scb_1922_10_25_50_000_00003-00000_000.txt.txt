“ROBIN HOOD”

Speaking of the "Robin Hood"
company, which is booked here for
2 performances, matinee and night,
November 4, May valentine observes
that every, member is American born,
that the average age oi the principals
is twenty eight, and of the chorus
twenty four year; that thirty eight
are members oi churches, either
Catholic or protest-int, that everyone
has had two years or more or con-
servatory study and every member
was selected by Miss valentine her-
self. So ambitious are the choristers
that practically every member is an
understudy, and three complete casts
tor "Robin Hood" can be formed on
a minute's notice trom the chorus.

Miss valenﬁne’s plan lor an opera
comique contemplates several large
companies of this kind, pre-
euting. new and standard operas in
English. staged and interpreted so
they are understandable by the mass
at musical comedy lovers, but always
maintaining the highest standards or
musical art.

Girlsl \l'hrtt’s a primitive lover-l

Constance Talmadgo wants to
know. The screen star has sue»
cninbctl to the suits or all kinds oi
Romeos during her screen career
lnutl tools that she should know. The
ltllfflculty is, as she admits herself,
that she doesn’t.

In her latest picture, “The Pri-
mitivc Lover,” she has to yield to
a lover who uses cave man methods,
according to the recognized code.
When the story was planned it was
intended to make the suitor-ins a men-
tal onc. Shutting up a girl as a cap-
tivc in an isolated mountain but was
thought to have been a sutlicient
strain to make her surrender.

“Not so" Connie retoitcd when she
read the script. “You gotta treat ‘em
I‘Dugh."

That started a debate. In the end
the star had her way, with the result
that she is handed a sample of the
Inquisition, the Merry Wires of
,Wlndsor and one of Bluebaard‘s
spouses all in on The funny part
‘nl it is she like it; but she's not
convinced" it's the way the average
girl would be won.

"That seemed the way a cave man
would act to me,” she commented
alter the picture had been made.
”but I want to find out what the
forty million women in the United
States think about it.”

cd in college.

Coaches Rogers and MaoEachi-onl
state that the ﬁrst year men this year
compare very lavorably with the
squad or last year, which speaks well

was one or the best in the Valley.
The backﬁeld is better this year than

Sweet and “Red" Williams, of onawa,

making a name for blinselt as a hard

are lighting tor supremacy at the
pilot position, neither man having an
edge as yet.

Line Not so Strong.

The line seems to be rather weak
on one side but the way they have
been breaking up varsity plays speaks
well for thena Moyer is passing
back the hall, Morris, Omaha, and
lyerson, Grlnnell, are playing on each
side or Moyer at guards. It size
