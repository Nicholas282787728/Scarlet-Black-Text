THE LEGEND
We remember the words of the

and confidant. Now, as we were
about to depart, he said:

"Boys, when

there is no better education to be had,
than that which is derived from the
friendship of a true professor. Don’t
look on him as a specimen of distort-
ed human nature, but as'another man.
Tours is the same purpose. Be honest
with him; he will be honest with you."

Three years have passed and we
hsvs to admit that the headmaster was
wrong. What he told us was a legend,
beautiful but untrue. This matter of
faculty friendships has been so
abused in Grlnnell college that at
present there often exists in place of
frankness and real comradeship only
deception and hypocrisy. '

For there is in our midst that moat;

We are directing no diatribe. But
it is time that those who want the
honest friendship or prolcssors with»

We have reason to believe that some
