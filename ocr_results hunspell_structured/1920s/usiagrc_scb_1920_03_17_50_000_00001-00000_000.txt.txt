Republican Candidate
for Governor G i V e S
Views in Interview.

Nate Kendall, of Albia, aspirant for
the Republican nomination for govera
nor, gave his views on some of thc
issues of the coming cdmnaigu in an
interview yesterday.

He expressed the belief that this
year’s state campaign would be
largely dominated by national issues.
The Republicans will, he believes,basc
their campaign largely on the extrava—
gance and inefficiency of the Demo—
cratic administration. He favors the
League of Nations as altered by the
Lodge reservations, considering that
tho Lcaguo in its present form would
inevitably involve us in war. In his
opinion the League is almost sure to
become a campaign issue. ‘

Favors Soldicr Bonus.

Mr. Kendall is in Sympathy
su h progressive movements as pro
hi on and woman suffrage and stands
for a strong foreign policy. Although
statc issues are as yet undeveloped,
he’ brlieves that Iowa is rich enough
to equal surrounding states in their
prbvlsions for soldier-compensation.
This whole question is a complicated
one, and the wlsh of the men them—
selves should he formulated by,thc
Americdn Legion into a, Satisfactory
plan and presented for the approval
of legislators. He believes that the

that means for its settlement should
be immediately Worked out while the

need is present.

Mr. Kendall spoke in’ chapel Tues-
day morning. ,

“It is almost immaterial what you
do, provided you are intent on doing
it better than it is now being done,”
was the advice which hc gave.

Though We are apt to believe that
everything worth While has been done,
the serious work of the world is never
ended, in his opinion. The world
though more insistent today than ye r

demands tomorrow, and although the
work of tho world is being perform d
better today than ,ever before, there' 5

Many Athletes Take
Part in K. C. Meet

Over 250 athletes competed in the
ﬁfteenth annual track meet, held in
Kansas City last Saturday under the
auspices of the .Ksnsas City Athletic
club. They represented colleges and
universities all over the middle west.
Scores were not kept for the different
institutions, individual prizes only be—
ing given. - ,

Rodkey of the Univ 'sity of Kansas
won the Douglas cup in the GOO-yard
run, which event was descrihcd in an
earlier issue of the Scarlet and Black.
Schulz, star sprint man at the Univer-
sity of Missouri, took the 50-yard dash
in 5:2/5 seconds. Stone of Iowa State
College won the mile run in 4:40 4/5.

It rested in the eye of a needle as

yet it was worth $1,507.20.

It was a tiny fragment of radium,
for the Community hospital, to be used
in the treatment of cancer, tumors and
other diseases for which the qualities
of this metal are a remedy. Experts
declare that the fragment will be just
as valuable for medicinal purposes in
2,000 years as it is today.

Professor Blakeslcc is a close stu-
dent oi foreign conditions and has
spent much time studying the ﬁeld. He
spoke of the transformation that is
taking place in the world, and of the
periods of reaction that have set in.

Professor Blakcslee predicted many

lion apparently so serious.

According to Elakeslee, some of the
permanent results of the war are: i

(1) The advancement of that world
toward democracy, and the destruc-
tion of mllltarized aubocl-acy,

(2] An application, for the ﬁrst
time in history of the world, of the
theory of self determination, and no:
tional organization on racial lines.

“The World has, in a. way, been made
safe for democracy, but has the world

Blakcslee. "History gives no war-
rant for the idea that a democratic
government is a peaceful one. The
principle of self determination will
not alone moire the world safe. An
international union is the only solu-
tion. The problem of grouping our
democl‘acies as a large unit, and of the
adjustment of international relations
not yet
solved and is a problem that should
appeal to all college men and women.

"To what extent shall the United
states give up power to a central gov-
ernment for the good of the world?
All other considerations rest on this
question of the extent of our surren—
dcr of freedom of judgment and of
action to a central authority, for the
American people desire an effective
League of Nations, despite Congres-
sional delay and duibbling.

“Premier Clemenceau says: ‘If there
had been an alliance between the
United states, Italy, Great Britain and
France, there would have been no
war.’ " The economic cost of the war,
$337,000,000,000, then, is not the cost
but the price paid by the world for
its failure to perfect a world organi-
zation for the adjustment of interna-
toinal difficulties.

“The question has been ‘Will Amer-
‘03 plaly up when the timc comes for
a League of Natlons?‘ The American
people are today saying: 'America will
play up now that the time has come.’ "

Indications of an unusually large {Lt‘l

home couccrt of the Ci 5' Glee Club
in Herrick Chapel Friday evening are
‘the result of one of the hcavicst scat
sales in years, which opened at Dal-t»
hug and Nuckolls' Monday afternoon.
This year's program promises to be
an unusually interesting one. Part I.
is made up of glee club numbers, a
vocal solo by Maude Hutchins, a violin
solo by Lucile McDannell, and El. read-
ing by Jean Smith. The novelty num-
ber of the program is entitled “The
Merry Melldlesume Maids", who will
sing, it is Said, a “medley." Just what
the number is is a matter of much
discussion, but little information is
to he had on the subject. Part II. is
a group of Indian melodies entitled
collectively, “From An Indian Lodge."
Another feature of the concert will
he the absolutely new costume cl‘ea
ations of the club, tho result of ten
days' work on the part of a Chicago
nicdisfc who came to Griunell for this
express purpose. Rumor has it that
‘Tmllt seats will br. .set aside for tho

ahead of the rest of the field in the|
doubles section of the Dormitory_
Cribbage League by winning a 271
match from Building VI Saturday aft
cruoon and by defeating Clark Hall
last night by the same score. These;
games give Building IV a percentage

shut-out match from Matthews of
Building 1V, wliilc, Building iv opened
their season in the .ingles by splitting
a doubleheader with Building iv,
placing them just behind Clark Hall in
the percentage column. Hazard won
a 2'1 gamc from Matthews of Building
1V and lost to Lupton by the same
score.

In their doubles match with Builds

Chrésto-Ellis To Get

Effects With Original Scenery

Something different in stage setting
is the aim of Chrcstumathla and Ellis
Societies who will present the three
plays, “Neighbors," "Suppressed De-
sires,” and “King Argemincs" March
23 ill, the Colonial Theater. The scen-
cry to he used will be entirely new and
is being built by the men of the soci-
ety. The proceeds from the plays
will be given to the College to buy
scenery and to aid in furthering dra—
matics in Grinnell.

In the plays, live scenes showing ﬁve
different localities Will be suggested
by the scenery. One of the Scenes
will he a symbolic representation of a
throne room in one of Dunsany‘s "own
lands." The aim is to have the throne
room give the same effect that Max
Reinhardt made use of in his produc-
cloud.

The modern tendency in stagLLcraft

 

New Stage

is to get away from the method used
by Belasco~who attempted to get ab»
solute realism on the stage by using
much propcrty and by painting per<
spectivc—and rather to use the ex-
treme settings that are entirely sym-
bolic. Tho societies, however, plan to
compromise between these two sets
and to produce a more naturalistic cf»
fcct by setting tho plays as simply and
Its effectively as possible. Gordon.
Craig's'scenes set—that is using ser-
ies of scencs and bringing them to
gather in up Squarcs~will be followed
as nearly as possible.

The setting will contain no new in-
novations except that no foot or border
lights will be used. The stage will be
lighted chiefly with flood lights which
will produce a more naturalistic ef—
fect than that used in most commer-

Liberty Alone Able
To Regulate Society

Liberty, the ‘power to make choice
and will effective, is the only thing
that can make order in society, in the
estimation of Professor C. F. Lavcll
who spoke at Vespers Sunday after—
noon. ,

Although our liberty is limited by
our own complcxity and by the desircs
and needs of others, there is a dell~
nitc and real choice, The individual
is molded by circumstance, environ-
ment, and hcredity, and this necessi-
tates an equality of opportunity for
evcry an to find his place. Liberty
thus becomes a freedom to see the
light and live in willing harmony with {

Robin Proves Pied
Piper For Local
Golfers

"Shorty” McDermott went out on his
front porch the other morning. The
air was fresh; the sun was bright and
a. robin sang. Shorty Went in the
house and found a couple of golf
balls. He dug up his clubs. He
called up Charley Snyder.

"Don’t tempt me,” said Charley.

"I and tempting You,” said Shorty.

“I'll be ready in twenty minutes,"
said Charley,

And he was.

They started north and went past
Homer Richardson’s house. Homer
was putung a new number on his car.

“Where you going?“ said Homer.

“Goiu' to play golf/Said Shorty.

"VVdit till I change ruly shoes," Said
Homer.

They Went to Dr. A. J. Brock’s.
Doc was cleaning out his garage.

“We‘re goin' to play golf.”
Shorty.

“Just let me put on my rubbers."
said Doc.

And that explains how the ﬁrst
foursonie of the 1920 season happened
to be played on the Country Club
links.
