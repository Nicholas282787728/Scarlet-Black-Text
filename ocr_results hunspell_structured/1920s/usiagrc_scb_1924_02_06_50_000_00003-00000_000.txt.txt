The orthodox view says that Christ

built up about the person of Jesus
Christ. This is the view hold by

0n the other hand the modern view

Christian religion is.

Jesus was not a teacher of novelty
in the opinion of the speaker; he
had what We call originality and

of
the old religion in a way they never
had before.

Christianity is, therefore, religion
itself and is merely the spirit of Jesus
fulfilling the unfillcd elements in our
lives, habits and ways of living.

The work of the Christian church is
not prayer meetings and church sup—
pers, he said in closing, It is the
work which the men and women must
do to keep the world going in the spir-
it of Jesus, in fulfilling the unfulfilled.

.lhiiu 'Wt‘lcltlllt‘s Doll‘glttcs

At fl meeting of the Fellowship eon-
lcroncC on Tuesday morning, I’l‘e
Llellt Mill“ Spoke on Glinnell college
(Ami its welcome to the conference

"This is a felluuship conference,"
he sdizl, “organized ten years ago,
with the thought in mind that it is the
busme 0f the college to cu-Dpel'ﬂte
in bringing to realization the spirit oi
Fellowship between the Congregational
churches ztlltl thls college, and to
stimulate thought."

Ill answering the question as to
\vheLhcl' G ‘nuell college is Congrega-

‘ tiollal.” President Main stated that “if

them is such a thing as a Congl'egu-
tioiial college Gl'inllell is one,"
“This institution is religious, based
on religious principles. It is not a
rich indn’s college as statistics show
today that sitlyrlive pcrccnt nf-tbc
men and thlrt five percent of the
women, either partially or wholly
work their way through school. Life
in Gl'inuell is a community life, with
fraternity ties without frats. The
spii t of Crinncll is voluntaiy, as the
mission of heaven is on voluntary
principles, he said in answer lo
many questions regarding this phase.

President lllain emphasized the val-
ue of these annual conferences lioth
lo the college and to the churches.

First Bradshaw lecture.

“Jesus; a Composite Negative," was
the title at the address which Prof.
Marion J, Bradshaw delivered before
the fellowship conference Tuesday al~
Reunion in the first of his series of
lectures upon “Gospel Portraits of
Jesus.”

In presenting his first picture of
Jesus, Prof. Bradshaw searched
through the tour gospels and showed
how and why men had opposed Jesus.
He told of each Sign of opposition to
Christ and why men had belived they
should line up against him.

“Jesus knew that keeping religion
\itdl depended upon fresh expression."
As at result, his new teaching and new
doctrine astonished those who were
accustomed to believe only in the old
and many expressed themselved again-
st him.

Prof. Ryan Speaks

In spoaking bctore the fellowship
conference Wednesday morning on
“The Minister as an Effective Public
Speaker," Prof. J. 1". Ryan passed m»
er the theological and social aspects
of the problem as dealing with the
content, and confined his attention to
the elements of voice Ind bodily or
tion as comprising the factors of CF
fectivoncss. He pointed out that the
test of effectiveness in speaking is not
only he reaction in the mind of Hi"
listener, but the richnessof technique
and the height of ideal.

“It is quite the populnr indoor Suns
any sport to talk about the decadent
or preaching and the tneffeciveness of
the minister as a public speaker," said
Professor Ryan. “The public speaking
found in the pulpit today is not deca-
dent and is not artificial, but is far su-
perior to what it was a low years ago.
More than that, speaking among the
ministers is far better than speaking

among college professors and business
men."

Address To Brotherhood
Speaking before an informal meet-

people'

gational church last night, Rev, J. ‘

W. Herring of Torre Haute dealt ex—i
tensively with the present financial,
economic and political devastation of
Europe resulting from the World war

Jlr. Herring has only recently re
turned from a lengthy study of EuroA
Dellu problems and in his speech pre«
sented his subject from first hand in—
toriliation. Ho captioned his story
"The Force and the Spell of the Sci--
pent," and proceeded to liken the
present inclination of European coun-
tries to result to strenuous armament
plugiaips in the face of future possible

‘ to the hypnosis of a personl
u-llose eye has been caught and llxetl‘
liy that of a deadly serpent,

Telling or the reparations titnglc, he
said, “France realizes that she can't
cut the can": throat and Illilk her at
the some time. She has given up all
hope of milking her.”

other salient statements from
address include:

“I found that the European totlzty
gets {rightfully sick at the stomach
when the soul guilt of Europe is re-
ferred to."

“We are come to the conclusion tar
day that all the peoples of the world
are guilty for the War."

“Since America, w 'ch was the light
of hope to all Europe, left the call»

forth. on their separate paths."

”Germany is turning from the pol-
icles and the men of the revolutionary
period following the War, to a new
Bismark, and is determined on re-
rouge "

“England must relieve the situation
in Europo or England must perish,"

“Either the situation in Europa
changes or England becomes a coolic
nation.”

The hypnosis cl force is compelling
England to arm again to compete with
tho French,"

"Under the hypnosis of force Eurov
pean people are turning from the
impossible to the unthinkable.”

“Not until there is a conscious con-
viction in the faith of friendship, not
until people cease to think of neighbor
peoples as 'Hllns,’ will there he peace."
