READS POEMS AND STORIES

“Loctnrette” Includes Singing of Folk
Songs of America and Bonding of
His Own Poetry.

By Blitync MCCIIIJ‘)’

Giving a program which he termed
an “American Miscellany," Carl
Sandburg poet-biographer and auth—
or of “Chicago Poems,” “Cornhuskr
ers," “Smoke and Steel," “Slabs of
the Sunburnt West.” “The Rootahaga
Stories." and "Abraham Lincoln,"
created a very favorable impression
with the majority of the large aud—
ience which packed Herrick chapel
last night. "This is not a lecture but
ya lecturett he said in his slow, easy
‘nianner, "it resembles a lecture just
as a kitchenette resembles a kitchen."

His program was divided into four
parts; a, short discussion of Abraham
Lincoln. a discussion of American
poetry and art, a reading of his poems
and some of the “Rootnbega Stories,"

> and the singing of a number of songs
he has picked up in his .‘inunts about
the country.
[5 Rugged Illtliritll'ml

When Mr. Sandburg came upon the
Platform the audience saw its inl-
agined conception of a poet, except
that ho was slightly more rugged than
the ordinary notion one has of a poet.
His iron»gray hair was parted toward
the right side and a lock of it hung
over his furlleﬂd. He wore it bow tie
and a gray suit. But when he began
to speak his low, \‘ibrantly musical
voice took all attention away from his
appearance.

Throughout the entire "lecturette"
there was a vein of satire directed
against those critics in the audience
Whom he felt had. condemned his art.
that of free verse, and who had come
to justify themselvessfor Sandburg
presents common Amer a as it is
rather than as the superficial critics
would like to believe that it is.

Many Books on Lincoln

In discussing Abraham Lincoln, he
said that there are now 2700 books
about the character that comes nearer
to being an American epic character
than any other one," He intended to
make his book about 500 pages but it
turned out to be 970. Sandburg relat»
ed the life of Lincoln in a rather sums
mry fashion and Seemed to think that
his great virtue was "That he spoke
the simplest wisdom in’ everyday
_\vords."

The discussion of poetry was begun
by reading hazardous definitions gath—
ered from the Atlantic Monthly and

Des Moines Man Talks
To Club on “Business”

. R. Stoits Give Business Club Mon
Lesson in Business Principles.

“You've got to start at the bottom
and work up in business. even if you
are a college graduate,” said E. IL
Stotts, president of the Miller laun-
dry company and head of Dodd and
Strnthers Company, before. a
meeting of the Business club in Bulld-
ing Three last Sunday afternoon. The
rise or a college man will be more
rapid but he cannot expect to start in
near the top.

His talk was not of a strictly ad-
visory nature but kept within the
bounds of ‘Lhe two industries Mr.
Stotts is interested in, the lightning
rod and the laundry business. In
speaking of the former he pointed out
the need of men now to open up for—
elgn fields, and stressed sales exper-
ience as essential to anyone expecting
to go abroad or anywhere in a man—
agerlal capacity. He dispelled the old
illusion that lightning never strikes
twice in the some place but started
that it more often does so.

The laundry business presents a
good ﬁeld to a young man also. he
declared. At present its rating is
twelfth among all the industries of
the United States for business tran-
sncted. Here too, a man must start
at the bottom, learnthe business. pre-
pare himself, and work up In a re—
sponsible position.

.51in In Missouri Till '

“Grinucll has no intention of leav-
ing or being put cut of the Missouri
Valley oolliel'ence,“ Director of ALlI-
letics. H. J, I-Iulf, said vesterday when
questioned about a recent article in
the Des Moines Register which proph-
esied that Grinucll would have to
leave the conference.

“The fact that Charley Black and I
are going to larger institutions does
not moon that we have lost confidence
in Gl'innell,” ”Doc” Huff stated in
denial of the Register charge that the
leaving or him and Black meant
that Grluhell was losing Valley Pres»
figc.

lu refuting the statement that small
gate receipts would put Gi-mnell out
of the Valley, I-lnff stated that the
crowds had steadily grown larger
since Griuncll entered the conference.
He remarked that when the proposel
Central Iowa paving program was
carried out Grinnell's crowds would
be even larger. “DOC” Huff admit
ted that southern schools did not
draw at Grinnell but on the other
hand pointed out that the Drake
games at Grinnell drew as large an
attendance as those at Des Moines.
And granting equal weather condir
tlous the Ames games on Ward ﬁeld
were attended as well as those at
Allies. .

The Register statement that the
roundrrobin basketball schedule was
dropped by the Valley because Grinr
nell could not support it ﬁnancially
was declared false by Huff. He said
that the roundrrohin was discontinued
because it was felt to be too great a
strain on the athletes to play so many
games in such a short time, The litany
long trips involved were felt to he (letr
l-imcntal to the athlete physically and
scholastlcally. I-lufl pointed out that
there was only one vote against disA
carding the round-robin schedule.

Huff crprcssod both surprise and in
dignaticn that it should be even hint»
on that Grinnell’s days in the valley
are numbered. "Both from, the stand
point of competition and ﬁnances
Grinnell expects to hold the high pu-
Sition which she is now in."

ACTIVITY LISTS DUE.

Senior activity lists are now due
and may be mailed or handed to Mar-
garet Stuart or the editor. The ac-
tivity lists must be compiled beloro

sist by turning in their lists as prom-
ptly as possible. All major activities

Jerome Hughes has been chosen to
take the role ul ”Henry" in place of
Emil Billiarz, who has been ill, in
"Outward Bound.” Hughes is not a
member of the Dramatic club, but he
is capable of filling the place at such
a short notice as he has demonstrated
his ability in previous plays put on
by the Dramatic club.

Preparations for this play are gov
ing ahead rapidly, The production
work in charge of the Experimental
theatre is completed, and the cast is
showing splendid form in rehearsals.
The tlckct sale began last Monday at
Talbott-s Drug Store, and according
to Davrd llcCoruack is progressing
nicely.

“Outward Bound” promises to be
the outstanding performance given by
the Dramatic club this year. The
very uaturc of the play makes it
abound with thrills and sensational
climaxes. The play has been recog-
nized as a production of worth and is
in demand after a. huge succcss in
London and New York. Tentative
plans are under way for a tour of the
Dramatic club includes Des Monies.
Fort Dodge, and other Iowa citie, in
the presentation of the play. Davrd
McCormick, business manager, will
have charge of the tour in the event
that it can he Sllfcessllllly arranged.

The whole play centers around the
adventures of nine persons in the after
world. The scene of the entire play
is laid in a lounge smoking room of a
siiiall‘occan liner, a nameless, mystef
ions, and phantom bont plying on the
River St - ~ between this world and
Heaven or Hell. The characters are
more or less types; they range from
the highest to the lowest strata of so-
ciety. There is the society matron,
lnnllrftllountrtown, clergyman, pompui
cus business man, a war mg woman,
and :1 pair of lovers.

The first act introduces tho char-
acters being bewildered and
frightened at their strange surround-

Increase of the enrollment of men
at Grinnell is one of the principal oh—
lectives of a movement which has been
gathering strength during the last
few months, sponsored by a joint com-
mittce ol graduatesaud students, look-
ing forward to an enlargement of the

dents who will be at home during the

high school seniors who are planning
to attend college next fall.

Graduates throughout the middle
west have been active since early in
the fall, bringing the claims of Grins
nail to the attention of high-school
men and their parents and friends.
Wherever graduates are available they
will cooperate with the students who
are home, the idea being that a stu—

few years. It is said to be a fact
that the influence of college students
themselves is one of the largest fac-
tors in leading a highrschool student
to his choice of a college.

Within the next two weeks several
short sessions will be held at the
dormitories at which the men who are
going home for the vacation will dis-
cuss the best methods to follow, and
will receive material to use in talk-
ing to high—school seniors. It is ex-
pected that not less than one hundred
and fifty men will take part in this
effort.

the ﬁlth annual indoor meet held at
Antes last Saturday. The big margin
of points garnered by the Cnrnlluske

track followers as Missoul'i‘had been
counted on to make a tight meet.
However the Bengal tracksters had
an off day which enabled the Kansas

each of these cvcnts hc equalled the
Valley record, In the dash his time
was 5 1-10 seconds and in the hurdles
6 seconds flat. Second honors Went
to his teammate Weir who won the
high hurdles and took second in the
lows.

Owen of Allies furnished another
surprise of the day in winning the

to expectation and gained only a tie
for fourth. The Tiger star had been
conceded ﬁrst place by the dopesters
but apparently was oil iorm.

. .vs Indivul Idras on All Do Not
Moan Anything: Art For
lint Not Every 0nc.

By 1m e Gero

“Individual ide‘an on art mean noth-
iug;" Mr. Carl Sandburg remarked to
ma last evening after. his recital. This
most versatile modern American writ-
cr believes that art is created for the
sake of z’trt; for one man or two men
r~lnr many men: but not for all men.
"No one living man, he said, can ape
preclate all art.’ ‘Al't is too colosr
snl."

“It doesn’t matter," Mr. Sandburg
continued, "wllrt‘t man thinks about a
work of art. \l'ult Whitman through
his essays on Grant would outlive his
versus" . . . Here the big man's voice
tl'nllctl off; his light nol'dlc eyes look-
C(l wistlully into the distance. Per-
ll‘ips lie was thinking of his own cre-
a olliwr Sandburg also has_ his
favorites. or all his writings the
"Rootahztgzt Stories” and “Rootaliagn
Pigeons” are perhaps, closest to his
heart. "My free verse, will, I suppose,
someday be lost—but, perhaps a
thousand years trom now, one or two
of the "Routnbagu Stories" will still
be kicking along. The “Rootabaga
Stories" were first composed for the
amusement or his three small daugh-
ters, then written for publication.

Mr. Sandburg believes “tilere is too
much bluff in art." He said that jeor
ple should be more holiest with them-
selves, "They should be more sin»
core in their appreciation, Here, of‘
course, the pact-biographer, was de-
veloping the point he made in his
lecture; that "it is better to say you
don’t register to a piece of art, than
that you appreciate it."

Perhaps Mr. Sandbar-gs greatest
work iS his "Abraham Lincoln, The
Pr c Yezu Mr. Sandburg spent
thirty years in research work before
hc began the actual writing of the
book. it stresses the carly back-
woods life of our first "epic hero"
and tho social and ecnnomlc forces
which played so important a part in
LlnColn’s life.

Mr, Sandburg agrees with professor
F. I, Herriot’s theory that the German
vote was influential in getting Lincoln
the nominutlon in 1860. He said that
Professor Herriot had done a. "fine
piece or work on that particular phase
of Lincoln‘s life.

In speaking or biographies in gen»
eral, Mr. Sandburg said that ”the fu-
ture biographies will deal more with
background," Mr. Sandburg bclieves
that background and environment are
the most influential things in life.

When I asked Mr. Sandburg what
he would suggest as a means to 111
end for those who aspired to write,
he very quickly repliurl, “Write” 7
then, "keep on writing." A few sec-
onds laterhe added to that, “One must
live to write."

St. Patrick’s Day Talk
Given by Prof. Lavell

tory lleﬁlll Declares That Irishman
Dcduccs ’l‘llmngll Sillthesis.

“Prove to an Irishman that a thing
is logical, and he will immediately
deny it," u" the keynote oi the
chapel talk which Professor Cecil F.
Lavell gave this morning, on the 00»
casion of St. Patrick's Day. Unmind»
fill of his positicn in the history de—
partment, which supposedly deals with
provod facts, Dr. Lavell stated at the
outset that he would "not hestltate to
state the truth, and even stretch it a
little."

The Irishman does not concern him-
self with scicutific precision, but
rather looks at things in the large,
and arrives at his conclusions by
synthesis rather than by analysis. The
green earth and the clouded skies of
the Emerald Isle do not facilitate
what we call “clear thinking," but
the Irishman would not exchange
them for perpetual sunshine.

When St. Patrick was clearing Ire«
land of snakes, according to Mr. La.-
veil, he encountered one reptile who
protested his innocence, whereupon
the good saint replied, “I would rath-
er face the devil himself than a shake
with a thousand scales and no heart."
This anecdote illustrates the horror
which an Lrlabman fuels for cold sta-
listics. ‘
