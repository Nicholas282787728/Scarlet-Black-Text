year. Prof. Paul Wood. who has
spent a two year’s leave of absence
at Trinity college. in Connecticut,
will again head the English depart-
ment. He was distinctly nan—com-
municative about his studies while
on leave. and murmured labseutly
that he didn't think the things he
has been studying would be within
the realm of interest of Scarlet and

Black renders.

Dean Would See Men

Mr. Shelton Beatty, the new dean
of men, will be added to Professor
Wood's department as part time pres

Bethel college, in Tennessee, and his
master's this year from Cornell uni-
versity. At Bethel. Mr. Beatty has
had both teaching and aministrative
experience, and was acting president
of the college during the school year
19264927.

“I have been particularly impress-
ed while I have been here,” he told
the reporter, “by the high personal
quality oﬂ the men here. And would
you state that I want to meet all of
them personally. I hope they will
drop into my office frequently."

Also new in the English depart-
ment is Harold S. Wilson, instructor.
He holds a Bachelor of Arts from
Dalhousie College. Canada, and his
Master of Arts from Harvard. Last
year he taught in New Brunswick.

New Zoologlst

Morris M. Slotnick will take Mr.
Gaylord M. Merriman's place as as-
sistant professor of mathematics. He
took his A. B. magna cum laude from
Harvard University, majoring in
languages and math. In 1926 and
1927 he enjoyed the Rogers travel-
ing fellowship and was a national
research fellow the next year. Mr.
Slotnick took his master‘s and mm
tor’s egrees also from Harvard.

In the Zoology department Miss

.Elizabeth Blagg of Grinnell, ’25, will
take the instructor's position left
vacant by Mr. Bomber. Miss Blagg
took her M. A. in physiology this
year at Allies.

Likes Chapel Organ

ment will add an assistant professor

foundation. Mitchell Dreese took his
bachelor's, his master's, and his doc-
tor's degrees from Columbia univer»
sity working under Dr. Harry Kit.
chener. Mr. Dreese has taught for
five years in summer schools and
high schools, all in the East. “I am
charmed with your city and college,"
he commented; “especially the
friendly atmosphere. I was rather
fed up on New York.”

Professor Goodwin was more re
served in his praise. “The organ in
the chapel is a very fine instrument,"
he answered the interviewer; "and
you may quote me however you wish
on this affability stuf Prof. Hugo
Goodwin is professor of organ and
composition in the position vacated
by Dr. G. Herbert Knight. In re-
cent years he has been municipal

Thirty Men Drill Twice a Day
For Opening Tilt With
Penn College.

BY KEN CLAYTON

After startling the first Pioneer
football rehearsals on the day follow-
ing Friday the 13th, Coach L. L.
“Fuzz" Wall. has found himself with
a 1928 team almost intact but still
deems life to be full of worries, for
Evenor Bradley. 195-pound center,
has not returned to college. Right
now he is grooming three men for
the post. Heldridge, although a
guard. saw some action at center
last year, and lacks like a good
wager. Holman. who played tackle
with the 1923 yearling squad and
Christoffersen. a sophomore veteran
from Cedar Rapids are possibilities.

The shifting of the scarletehaired
Heldridge to center will depend large—
ly on the work o1 Tipton, a new-
comer on the varsity squad but who
looked like a real lineman while with
the prep eleven last year. Cox and
Christoffersen are also getting plenty
of chance at flanking the pivot post
and the veteran Parish looks like a
fixture.

Much Biwklield Maternal.

Walker, Humphrey, Klinefelter and
Cooper have been getting the call
at tackles and Minier and Briggs
still look good at the Wings. Neilson,
Spanglcr and Bilto get their cracks
at the ends, however. and may spring
a surprise anytime.

Arrassmith, a scintillating half-
back from Boone, is not returning
this year but Lhe mentor seems able
to find plenty of backfield material.
He has been running a pair of back
fields that look to be fairly evenly
matched. In one group, Thomas does
the work at quarter with Benny
Douglas at fullback and while the
other finds the Veteran Ernie Moln-
tire at quarter and Harold Rose at
fullback, The halfback posts are
juggled about with Ruff, Liedtke and
Ritchie looking like regulars.

Penn dame First.

Although all of (be lettermen are
back on a squad of some 30 men re-
porting daily for practice in both
morning and afternoon, Coach Watt
expects several more gridders to
show up before the end of the week.

The Pioneer schedule opens a week
from Saturday with Penn college
here when most. of the men will be
given a chance to see real action.

Home Sick!’ ‘l’m Not Afraid!’ Preps
Tell Reporter When They Come Here

BY JANE DIODRE.
“1v v' heart just sank when I came
to Grinnell,” said one freshman girl
frankly on the evening of her an

rival The fellows of the incoming

class, while apparently under no less
strain, seem, at least, to stimulate
courage.

“I’m not scared,” one boy remark-
ed entirely irrelevantly to the Con—
versation. Whether he was merely
applying a verbal prop to his own
courage or looking with scorn on the
weakllngs around him, he did not ex~
lain,

By dinner time on Tuesday ever
ing some of the new students were
uite acclimated to college life. Ruth
eLong, of Gary, Indiana, and inci-
entally a sister of Bob and Chuck,

informed us that she had been here

since six o’clock on Tuesday morn~

ning and had had time to get mighty

lonesome already. With some of
them, however, the attack was even
more acute, and one freshman col-n-
plained that she was homesick the
minute she got off the train.

The talents of the freshman class
are already making themselves

 

known. Fred Johl of Fredericksburg.
if his baggage is at all indictive, is a
drummer of note, and we noticed
several husky fellows with football
equipment which seemed to speak
well for the athletic future of Grin-
nell. The piano in Mears cottage, al-
so seemcd to be testifying Tuesday
evening to the musical ability of the
new girls.

Some of the freshmen have the
way paved at Grinnell by older broth-
ers and sisters. Mary Hayes of Red
Oak seems to find many friends
through Charlotte and Douglas, and
Helen Ruth Leake of Exira is taking
Mary Louise's place a a Grinnellian.
Edith Jones and Wi fred Webster
are others who have predecessors to
introduce them to Grinnell.

Yet all of them, familiar or until»
miliar, themselves swept away in
the great wave of confusion that ov-
ertakes all who have been freshmen,
whether it be in Grinnell or the Uni-
versity of New York, and, though
they chat blithely of the all-college
dance or how good-looking the new
dean of men is, one sees in their eyes
a tremulous glint seeming to say
how much more appreciated they
were back home with mama and

papa.

 

Freshmen Meet
Many Listed as
Student Leaders

The student‘s who’s who, composed
of the heads of the different organ-
izations on the campus, contains the
names of those people who are lead-
ers in the school, and whom fresh-
men will hear much about during

ma, house chairman of IV; Eva Ad~
ams. chairman of III; Elizabeth
Lynde, chairman of II; Doris McCor-

Blanche Hulsebus. James Davis has
charge of the student council, which
is a student organization that takes
up campus problems and helps in
governing the college. Richard Phil-
lips is president of Lantern, a men’s

Freshmen Homes
in Various States

Although the largest number of
students entering Grinnell this fall
come from Iowa as they have in past
years there is also an unusually large
quota coming from farther removed
sections. Two girls are entering from
the distant state of Pennsylvania—
Const‘ance Kent from Swhrthmore
and Margaret Reynolds from Coats-
ville. Also from the East coast Jack
DeWindt from Bayside, New York,

Two boys are entering from Cali-
fol-niaiJohn Snoody from San Diego
and Rudolph Schlenk from Holly-
wood. Dorotby Noll of Aberdeen,
Washington also comes from the
West coast. Ohio. Nebraska. Illinois.
Missouri and other mid-western
States show a good representation.
Omaha, Nebraska, is sending the
largest number of students from any
one city outside the state of Iowa. As
in past years a large delegation is
coming from Des Moines.

First Chapel to Be
Similar to Vespers

The convocation chapel Monday
morning at eight will serve as formal
opening of the school year. Presir
dent J. H. T. Main will preside, and
the program will have the Chardc»
teristics of a condensed Vespers.

The Vesper choir, in vestments,
will enter in formal procession,
and answer the Scripture reading
with responsive chants. Miss Leah
Pratt will have a solo part in the
anthem. President Main will deliver
the adress and benediction, and the
service will close with a formal re~
cessional.

The length of the service has not
been fully determined. but should be
slightly under an hour. The four
morning classes will follow in regu-
lar order, but in shortened periods.

College Entertains New Class
at Dinners, Meetings, Dances;
Many Activities Open to Frosh

Athletes, Writers, Actors
Will Find Outlet

for Talent.

BY HELEN lllNGERY.
Freshmen ho have participated in
outside activ ies as ,High School stu-
dents will find no lack of demand for
their talents in Grinnell. In past
years many desirable places on the
campus have been filled by freshmen.
Athletic. dramatic, Journalistic, and
musical activities welcome interested
freshmen whom they may train as
future leaders, while the majority of
organizations on the campus wel-
come freshmen to membership.
Athletics as always will claim a
maximum of attention. A freshman
football squad is chosen each year
and trained as varsity material. of-
(Continued on Page 3).

Frosh Athletic
Records Good

Imposing Gridders, Runners,
Basket-Shooters Found

Among Yearlings.

Although the great majority of
frosh athletes have not yet reported
regarding their high school activities,
the Grinnell college mentors have the
advance word on some of them which
should give the Class of 1933 one of
the most powerful athletic represen-
tations in years if high school work
is born out here.

Jimmy Allison, a brother of Sher»
man, who, although he only weighs
140 pounds, captained the State Cen-
ter grid aggregation of 1923 and led
the plays from his quarterback posh
ition, is an outstanding member of
the gridiron crew.

Bowley of Muscatine needs little
introduction to fans who have follow-
ed Iowa high school athletics, having
been a star in football and basket~
ball. Pojman of Chicago is the out~
standing class prospect for Coach
Lester Duke's proteges of the cinder
path, being a loo-yard and tic-yard
man who cuts the distance in record
time.

Fred Graﬂun and Gaston Santi of
Moline and Frank Duncan will up-
hold the reputation of the Tri-Cities
in Pioneer athletic circles, all three
being football veterans and the last
named playing a good bit of basket-
ball. Cedar Rapids has sent a pair
of men. Clarence James and Leonard
Hamilton, to follow in the steps of
Douglas and Christoffersen in three
sports, Charles Barrow of Manilla is
a football and basketball veteran.

Basketball hopes dropped when :t
was learned that Wayne Thomis,
sensational Chicago youth, was not
returning to college, but his place in
the Chicago trio is to be taken by
“Red" Warner, who is another of the
Murray, Cantrell and Thomis out-
fit. and who also delves out a hit of
flashy tennis if pressed. In this lat-
ter regard he should be well sup-
ported by Tatom. a Des Moines come
er, and an understudy of chgeshall.

The coaches are expecting more
yearlings to report at the gymnasium
within the next few days in regard
to their high school work in order
to give the tutors a complete sum-
mary of their work. Athletes are on
hand from points varrying from
prep schools in Connecticut to Cali-
fornia and the only method the
coaches have of getting any informa-
tion on the men is from the candi-
dates themselves.

Will all of you new girls go to
your rooms now, and choose the near—
est exit, as the theatre programs say"
In case of fire, walk, don't run; you
may lose your breath. In no case at-
tempt to use the ﬁre escapes. They
are for embellishment only, If you
should happen to find yourself on
one, walk calmly to the bottom and
surrender yourself to the keeper, It
pays to look docile.
