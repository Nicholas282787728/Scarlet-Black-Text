TAKES PLAY PART

Work on “Beyond the Horizon”
Is steadily Progressing.

“Beyond thc Horizon:- thc Dramatic
Club oircring to he presented at the
Colonial March 15th, is steadily pros
gressing under the dirccﬁou of Mr.
FaglIy-Cote.

Miss linogene Spencer, daughter or
rrot. and Mrs. E. B. T. Spencer, has
heen selected for the role or Mary.
This is the iii-st time that a child has
assumed an important part in o. Dra-
matic Cluh production. The demands
made upon the Iyolmg acti‘eSSI
are great, she must portray a rat»
iety of emotions, take an important.
part in the action, and assist in pro‘
ducing the striking atmosphere oi the
iarm tragedy.

According to Ralph Hall, stage man.
ager, the scenes for “Beyond the
Horizon" are being executed by Ml.
Pauly of the Princess theatre, Des
iioines. Mr. inley is giving the
production his personal supervision.

Following a custom esmblished by
the Moscow Art Theme in their re-
cent tours or the United states the
Dramatic Clllh asks that there be no
demonstration oi any hind until the
final curtain falls. The play will
commence at eight o‘clock promptly,
and no one will be seated during the
iirst scene. \

Polar Bear Chapter

Rumor has it that it local. chapter of
the Folar Bears club has been ill-
stalled at the Quadrangle, Last Sui-ls
day evening the memhers at that
organization donned the full regit'liit of
the‘ order—regulation Palni Beach
swimming apparel # and disported
themselves in the snow hanks west
or the Quad.

Paradoxical and impossible as it
may seem, we are told that a not time
was had by all. In fact, one of the
arctic Annette Keller-mans has assured
everyone that "They ’ad lods oh ind
doig id."
