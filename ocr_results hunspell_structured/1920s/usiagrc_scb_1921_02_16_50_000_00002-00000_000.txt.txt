THE PROBATION SYSTEM
A communication has been received
by the Scarlet and Black calling at-
tention to what was coiled an "i ,
policy”,
two editorials appearing in these col-
umns during the past two weeks.

consistency in editorial in

“some time ago,” according to the
writer, “the s s. B came iorth urging
that all students Who fall in their
studies be suspended. After exams,"
tho‘communication says, "a number
or students suffered the treatment
suggested in the paper, and this was
lollowed by an editorial saying that
the students had not had elm/ugh
warning, and mumatiug that {buy
should not have been dropped.

“Were they friends of some stall:
member?" the writer risks.

The Scarlet and Black has evideulr,
1y been misunderstood on this point,

It is a misfortune that the two edi»
'boridls came at the time they did, but
the action in dismissing students who
could nut keep up With the pace set
by their instructors has the idll' sup-
port of the Scarlet and Black.

The suggestion regarding the want»
ing, or probation system was design-
ed to advocate a regular prescribed
system or keeping a student informed

. as to his standing, both in matter or
‘ smies, as well as hours Work to his

,credit. In some larger institutions,

where the contact between instructor
and student is much less personal
than in Grlnnell, the grade posting
system is used. All grades are posted
for each class, and a 11st of students
on probation is‘ also posted every
monhl, or six Week . Then the stnd~
em. has no excuse (or not knowing
just where he stands.

While this probably would not be
advisable‘hcre, some system should
be devised to obtain the same results.
We are informed that students are
advised when they have cunrlitions in
one 01‘ more courses. We are under
the impression that they are not ad—
vised when they have a "17' in a
course. Our editurial advocated EL sys-

tem whereby a student could be ofr

iicially warned before he actually gcts ,

A S’IEP FORWARD

The wave of reform in styles of
dancing that is sweeping over cul-
leges or the country must surprise
the many college reformers, especialr
ly since the agitation {or better done»
in: is coming directly iron: the stud-
ents themselves. Student newspapers
are almost unanimous in their appeal
[for abolishment of the cheek to cheek
styles, and others of the some type.

Doubtlessly the reformers will say
that the foal that students are them-
selves tnking the lead in the reform.

called to such dancing. The Iowa in—

taken up the attack on the kinds oi
dancing seen on their dance floors.
Grinnell has been saved this question,
