The Gl'iunell team proved itself to
be a well co—ordinated machine even
when the second string candidates
were injected into the line—up and also
used their weight to administer a
sound drubbing to the St. Louis but-
ﬁt. The showing or the Pioneers in
this game takes on added signiﬁcance
when it is remembered that the score
of Saturday’s game was exactly the
same as that made by Notre Dame
against the same team on the prey»
ious Saturday.

Pioneers Extwl in st Downs.

The superiority of the Grinnell team
is plainly brought out by the fact that
they made at least three times as many
ﬁrst downs as their opponents and
only on few occasions were forced to
defend their own goal very strenu—
ously against the St. Louis attack. On
both of these occasions the Pioneer
lino held easily for four successive
downs and averted the possibility or a
St. Louis touchdown,‘ Practically all
of the Grinnell gains were made by
straight football which pierced the St.
Louis defense seemingly at will. The
Billikens on the other hand were able
to pain little by ordinary tactics and
made practically all of their gains by
the aerial route. ‘

Whitehili, playing at half back,
proved to be the sensation of the gains
when he intercepted a pass and ran
seventy yards tor a touchdown in the
fourth quarter. Walters played his
usual good game at half and was the
means by which the third Pioneer
touchdown was pushed over the Billi—
ken line. Baker, who ran the ball
over for the ﬁrst two touchdowns.
shared with Ty Smith the honors of
the full back position. Both men hit
the St. Louis line for substantial
gains and seemed to ﬁt perfectly into

VARIETY OF PROGRAMS OFFERED
WHEN FEMININITY INVADES DORMS

 

chattering femiuity invaded the
Dorms Saurdzty night, arrayed in her
gladdcst rags, and completely routed
the atmosphere or hallowed peace
that is accustomed to linger‘about the
classi'oolus. consuming curiosity props

Building Pour, being nothing if not

Building Five offered bones and jazz

shoes disappeared mysteriously over
his shoulder, and his brilliant pupil,
who, blindfolded, described the nudi—

cassionally got his dates mixed.

The Quad buzzed all day Sunday
over the success oi the afiai and
the Quadites are forced to admit, with
apologetic surprise, that the boys are
pretty clever, ﬁlter all: The one thing
that continues to puzzle them is the
amazing number of men who went to

Indiana Prep Co-eds
To Wear Green Button

Freshman co—eds at the University
of lndiana must wear green buttons
to distinguish them from upper-class
women. For years the men or the
yearling class have worn green caps,
but this is the ﬁrst year that the
freshman girls have been decorated.
The ruling was made by the Women’s
Self-Government Association and is

think that Grinnell could send us
some old basket balls?
ket ball boys are back and if they do
not forget all they have been taught
they wili«have a good team again.

The Mathews are both enthusiastic
about the work, like the students, like
the buildings, like the teachers and
starting in like that speaks well for
the future. They will do a good job
for Grinnell and I’m sure that the
school can bank on them

Mr. Hsu gave a speech in English

and he did a good job of it. During
the serving of refreshments funny

were told and acted out so well that
the windows rattled with apprecia-

SCARLET AND BLACK TEAM

caches Optimistic at Pioneers’
Hard Fought Genie.

Having proven that they can play
real tootball by trouncing the Bil—
likens last Saturday by the same can)»
lortable margin that Notre Damé did
the week before, the Pioneers are
earnestly preparing for their mix
Twith Antics here on the twenty-ﬁrsL
intensive signal drill and scrimmage
‘with the preps is on the scarlet and
blacks daily schedule. The coaches
are optimistic over Gi‘iunell’s pros-
pects and hope to prove by the result
of Saturday's game that the 23 to o
victory gained over the Pioneers by
Missouri does not show the relative
strength of the two elevens. The
players are priming for a victory but
they do not expect an easy game by
any manner of means.

After the disastrous game with Coo
the preceding week, the Cyclones
were not considered as very strong
contenders ior football honors this
fall, but with the surprising close-
ness of the score last Saturday, Ames
has shown a complete reversal of
form in holding the Tigers to a' s to 3
count, Ames can be depended upon to
improve from. last Saturday‘s game
because of the complete absence of
any injuries and they are bound to
improve at this stage of the season.

However, after returning from the
St. Louis trip where St. Louis U. rel
ceived a severe drubbing at the hands
of the Pioneers, the report is given
from the local coaches that not a
man is on the injured list and that
competition is especially keen in the
line. Many of the older men have
been put to the limit of late to hold
the preterence in the eyes ol the
coaches and although the lineup of
the team will not be picked until Fri~
day night, it is rumored that Wood,
Grimes and Dare might ﬁnd a place
in the line when the positions [are an—
nounccd. Either Hohbett or Watson
probably will hold down the lett wing
while Winters or Datesman will start
the other position. The backﬁeld
combination has been playing well
together and although there is noth-
ing certain about the way they will
stack up Saturday. Walters and
w'liltehiil will probably start at
halves, Baker at full and Critchett at
uarter.

T "Actions speak louder than words"
seems to be the slogan or the men
when asked to give their views in re-
gard to Saturdays contest; but the
icoaches are more definite in their
,answcrs. “Red” Eagan says, "If the
‘fellows play football the way they
now know they can play it, there will
ge no question about the game Satur-
day. but they will have to ﬁght hard
and it will he a close game" When
askod what were the piospects of
victory, coach Elward stated, “There
are no prospects about it: we are
going to win." This seems to be also
the voice of the students for entbuir
asm reign unchecked upon the cam-
pus and the watchword for the week
is, "neat Arnes."
