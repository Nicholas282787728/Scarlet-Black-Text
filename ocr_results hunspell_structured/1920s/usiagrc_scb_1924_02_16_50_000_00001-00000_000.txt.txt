'Win Seventh Valley Victory by
Piling Up Heavy Lead In
Early Pan of Game.

Outplaying and outscoring the
Gl'inllell Pioneers in the first half of

‘ their game last night the Nebraska.
Combuskor basketball mssers Won
their seventh Missouri valley confer-
ence victory 32 to 18.

Grinncll came back strong in the
second half but the 20 to 3 lead garn-
ered by coach Kline’s proiegcs in the
first half was too much for the Iowa
T103 . The Scarlet and Black scored
15 points to Nebraska's 12 in the SEC—
ond half.

Grime Slow to Start.

The game was rather slow getting
started, the two teams‘ battling for
seven minutes before a point was
chalked up by either team. Then the
Nebraska lads found the basket and
slipped the ball through the hoop for
fourteen points before WlnLers got
the first point for Griunell on a, free
throw. Benz scored a basket just be—
fore the close of the first half for
Grinneil's only basket of the first per.
iod.

IL was an entirely different quintet
that Coach MacEdchronsenLinw the
fray in the second half. They started
strong with the first whistle, and
outplayed the cornhuskors the whole
period. Captain Benz and Bog‘e led in
the attack, the former scoring three
baskets and the lanky center finding
the ring twice.

The first half lead, however, was
too much for the Pioneers and when
the game ended, Nebraska had acquir—
ed a 32 to IE victory.

Cozier and Goodsou were the out:
standing stars for Nebraska. Good.-
son scored 10 points and Cozier chalk—
ed up a counters. Cozier‘s floor work

_ was bordering on spectacular. Good-
son was especially effectice under the
basket.

Benz Sims

For Gl'inneli, Captain Benz played a
beautiful game. He was the only
member of the Pioneer aggregation
who could break through the Corn-
huskcr defense with any regularity.
He put up one of the prettiest ex-
hibitions of basketball seen on the
Coliseum floor this year. He was
also high point man of the game, scor-
ing four field goals and three free
throws for a' total of 11 points. Boga
and Winters accounted for themselves
ill a. creditable manner.

There has been a re-birth of enLllus-

opinion is decidedly in favor of the

Fol- each program two speakers who

HATDLTTEE TD TALK

George Washington and Ramsay

McDonald to Be Subjects
of Lectures Feb. 22.

The past, the present, and perhaps
a little prophecy tor the future will
come within the scope of ‘the two

lectures on “George Washington" and'

“Ramsay MacDonald" which 5. x.
Ratcliffe, English lecturer, publicist
and author, will deliver in Herrick
chapel on the morning and evening of
February 22. The first lecture
Washington will be delivered in a long
chapel as a special service for the
perpetuation of the name of tbs
“Father of His Country." The eye
ning lecture will be an “Ramsey Mac-
Donal the present prime minister
of England and a man who may play
as important a role in the history of
the future as Washington has played
in the past.

Mr, Ratollffe has long been known
to the American public as a lecturer of
unusual ability, both because of his
great fund of interesting and inter
mativc knowledge and because of his
power to size up an audience and ad-
apt his talks to the people before
him. The fact that Mr. Ratcliffe is
considerably above the averagq as tar
as public speakers go is shown by the
repeated calls which he has had to re-
turn year after year for American Eu<
gagemcnts, this year being his
eleventh consecutive tour on lecture
platforms of the United states.

As an editor for some years of dhe
leading English paper of Calcutta, the
statesman, he saw at close quarters
the rise of the Indian Nationalist
movement and watched the gathering

forces which later were immortalized,

by the lamous nonereslstance cam-
paign of Gandhi; and as a member of
the senate of the Calcutta Universlty
he was able to study the Intellectual
life of Young India. Mr. Ratcliffe
has also served in many ther cdltor—
ial capacities in other parts of the
world and has thus acculnulatoed a
mass oi information which should
makc him a speaker of more than
ordinary interest.

CO-EDS CURTSY

TO THE MEMORY

OF COLONIAL DAMES AND DANDIES

 

Tonight we wander back into the
past, a hundred years or so, and bor-
row our plumage from the father ol
our country and his famous llortha.
For a few hours, snatched from the
midst of our bus year, we surrender
entirely the celebrated freedom of
modern fashions. WiLh a curtsy to
our forefathers and their lady friends.
we abandon our comfortably slim and
slinky canton tropes for billowing
hoops and pannlers, and llide our hair,
which is apt to be ill a pally abbre-
viated state of nature, under the grac—
ious dignity of high-piled powdered
wigs.

They ~c hard to manage—these ln-
tricate, complicated clothes—but if
we are to follow in the footsteps oi
him who could not tell a lie, we must
admit we rather like to wear them

. once a year. We love our mirror:
when a tiny black beauty patch twink.
ies demurely above a dainty fiohu,
when a pair of silver slipper buckles
gleam beneath a swaying boopskirt.
We like to dress up and pretend we'—
re “ladics, instead of college girls”
. once a year:

Tonight, instead of the frantic in-
tensity of modern athletics, the ro-
mance and the gallantry of a century

The bare stage or A. R. H. audi-

ﬁgure in the Chinese cast, the prop-

ing the action he simply sits on the

American eyes as is the Chinese

"The Cowherd and the Weaving

the auditorium of A. R. H. on the
evening of March 1 in connection
with two dramatic composition class
plays, "lllaﬁnata." and “Drags."

~Navel ideas in staging are also be-

Dope Favors Grinnell in Meet
With Agg-l‘es on les‘ lied
Floor This Evening.

shinrting under their defeat of last
night by Nebraska, Coarh MacEach-
ron1s Grinnell casabo tossers are rest-
ing today at llan‘ualtan—awatlng the
whistle that will send them into the
fray against the Kansas Aggies Lo<
night, deter-mined to avenge their de-
feat of last night and and their trip
with .500 percentage.

The Pioneers defeated the Farmers
on thc Grinnell court last week, and
might to be able to duplicate that feat
on Lhe Kansas tour-i. Since the Ag-
gies’ more or less successful invasion
of lowfl last week when they won two
games from Ames and Drake and lost
to Grinnell they have met with sevoral
reverses at the hands of other valley
teams. Griuuell on the other hand has
won one game and lost one.

Benz is Outstanding

Captain Benz will of course be the
marked nran in the game. In Lhe last
gain-e between the two schools Benz
was responsible for 17 of Grinncll's
27 points, and he will no doubt be
carefully watched tonight. In spite
of that fact be will probably hear urn
brunt of the Pioneer attack, Bogs will
we be counted on also for scores.

The Aggie lineup will be the same
that has been starting most of their
games. Their two forwards. Bunker
and Wand, proved to be eldectlve bas-
ket shooters in their game here, and
will have to be closely watched by
the Grinnell guards. Most of the
Farmer's plays are centered around
their center, Tebow, who is a clever
floor man and a good shot. Captain
Webher is the mainstay in the Wild
Cat defense. Doolan plays the other
guard position since Koch dislocated
his arm in the Grinnell game last
week.

A win for Grinnell tonight will put
them in a tie with the Kansas Aggies
for fifth place in the b’hllex,stdndlng,
while n defeat will leave them in sixth
place.
