The most important hit or news iu
the Scarlet and Black thisissue, is a
little item which tells that the result
of an investigation in South Dakota
has made known that in- that state
more money is expended for the un-
keep or the school for feeble minded
and the insane asylum than is ex-
pended for the two state educational
institutions.

M proportion probably does not
exist in any other state yet the fig-
nres might not he so far apart. it is

TIIE GUILD NOT NEEDED

The Tanager Guild is one of those
organizations that is splendid in the
ory but not so good in practice. There
is no doubt that it might be valuable
in operation on some campuses, but
on Grinnell’s there is a. serious ques<

How can we expect to have suit '

in the musical organizations. in the

publications and in women's sports, if
there is tendency to divide the inter-

work.

Spend More For Insane.

At, the Un 'elSlty of South Dakota
it has been discovered that the state
of South Dakota has spent more for
the care of the insane and feeble
minded since 1888 than it has {or
its two institutions of higher learn-

The figures to bear out the slate-
