PROMINENT WOMAN
DIRECTOR SPEAK

Traces Development of Govern-
Through 'Ages.

Wednesday Inm' ng chapel was de-
voted to a lecture by Mrs. William G.
Hibhard oi Chicago, who is the Re
model Director of the Executive Com—
mittee of the National League or We
men Voters which came into being
in 1920. The League has as its slogan
that the most powerlul factors in the
world today are clear ideas in the
minds oi men and women. With this
end in view they endeavor to train
women in the understanding or gov-
ernmental organization and , the
knowledge oi the important move
ments of the day.

Mrs. I-Iiboerd successiully traced
the development of government lrom
its period or individualism to th
complex stage or man’s relationship
to all mankind as expressed in the
laws of common good. '

With the medieval age, there was the
iirst development or intcmationalism.
Before that time group consciousness
was dominant. Now we realize that
the culmination of,-‘éc0nomic prosper—
ity is dependent upon the perfection
of this international relationship,
Freedom, peace, and proﬁtable ec
nomic exchange, the ideals of a co’
monwealth, are all dependent upon
inter-nationalism.

Just as selﬁnterests precipitated
the last war, so will self-interests on
the part of the United states delay
world adjustment. This is the causej
ol the plea madc hy the Women Lea-
gues of Voters that the men, women,
and youth of today take interest in
the world as their individual problem
and think in terms or the world at
large. Individual opinion, culminat-
ing in public opi ion, guides states-
men in the formulating of their pol-
icies tor the futul .

In closing, Mrs. Hihhard urged that
