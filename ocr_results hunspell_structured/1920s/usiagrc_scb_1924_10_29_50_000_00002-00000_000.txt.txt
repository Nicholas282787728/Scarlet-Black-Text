Don’t we owe something, you say,
to the younger girls, who are expect-
ing to go into the societies within the
next few weeks? They may think so-
cieties are all right Is it lair to dis-
lppoint them, on the very eve of in-
ltiltion?

Personally, we're oi the Opinion that
it would be much better in disanpolnt
them on the eve of the initiation than
to disillusion them ”the morning af-

Strike While ﬂTe Iron is not

The timid souls ask, "Isn’t it too
late now to do anything about it this
year, now Lhey‘re giving rushing part—
ies , . , and everything?"

As a matter of fact, within these
next few weeks is a quite psycholog-
ical time to “do something about it"—

'to strike while the iron is hot. It's
the time of the year when the atten»
hon of the Quadrangle en masse is
centered on the society question.

Editor Scarlet and Black:

In the past week, we have all read
some pretty convincing statements:
about so-called "literary societies,"

discussion among the sophomores, at
Let us hope that this dis-
cussion won't be a “nine day’s wonder”
soon supplanted by other interests.
Now is the time to settle the question
of societies once and for all. Per-
haps an expression of the 01!-
of some sophomore girls
feel
about the matter, We have been
thinking about the whole situation
from the point ot view of those "on
the outside looking on the inside", in
other Words, of non-society girls.

.hre the Hearchcs Worth Whilol

ﬁrst, from talks with many of the
girls, we have reached the conclusion
that a large percentage strongly desire
that societies be disbanded. The girls
feel that for the little benefit that a
few might receive from society life
it is neither worth while nor neces
sary to repeat the heartaches of form-
er years.

Also. there are not many girls who
feel that they can spend money for

only to them but toJJJe entire campus
life. The statement of one girl, “I
