WﬂMEA’S SﬂﬂlEllES
ELEBT WEMBEHS

Approximately 90 Girls Accept
Membership in the Four Lite
army Societies.

The result of the new system which
the Women‘s liter-dry societies are
using this year to elect new members
seems to be that an usunlly large
number or non-society girls are being
taken into ihe'foul- societies.

The new system of elections rec-
ognizes and pro‘ides for the irnpor
once of the llolnrsociety girl being gi .
en her first choice among ihe sc-
Cieties; and it enables the societies
themselves to bring thei membership
to exactly the size they wish.

Until this year elections have been
held each semester. but according lo
the changed inter-sociely rules, this
is the only election which will lake
place throughout the entire year.

Florence Wells Talks
on Dr. Cabot Sunday

Florence Wells reviewed Dr. Rich-
ard Cahot‘s discussion cl worship in
his book “What Men Live By" at suns
day morning prnyers.

”Worship", says Dr. Cabot, “is the
desire to express our inmost selves."
We are worshipping when we glory in
a beautiful sunset or a. symphony just
as we are when we‘ pray. Prayer may
be wordless, if it is sincere, for words
are merely symbols of thought. Prayer
includes conicssion, petition, and
praise. it is like climbing or tree in
it deep forest to get one’s bearings.

"Worship alone can make work,
play and love creative," concludes Dr.
Cabot. "The harder we work and play
and love, the more pressing is our
need lor refreshing ourselves-in an
appeal to Grid.”

Nilvll Berger, accompanied by Doris
Fosslcr, sang “Thy Will Be Done."

PIUNEEAS BﬂﬂﬁlEA ll]
FIFTH PEABE IN M. A.

Two Consecutive Victories Give
Gage Men New Impetus for
Two Week-End/Gfimes.

Closing their series of home gumes
with two wins and two defeats, the
Pioneers leave Thursday- night lor lhc
second road trip ol'the season, play-
ing Nebraska at Lincoln Friday.
and the Kansas Aggies at Manhattan
satin-day. Grinnell is now in liilh
place, and two victories would move
the Scarlet and Blrrck terrm ahead any
other much.

The last two games have proven
that tile Pioneers who will play Ne-
braska Friday night will by no melms
be the same team that was defeated
by the Cornhuskers d wefli ago. The
hope is in favor of the Cor-irhuskcrs as
they recently heat the Washington
learn which was tied for iii-st place
ior- half the season, but Couch Ma"-
Eochi-cn has found a combination that
will make Nebraska play better bas-
ketball than they did here, if they are
to win.

Cozier is still the outstanding stm‘l
oi the cornlrusker team, but Grin-
uell‘s delenr has been polished up.
and he will find it more difficult to
slip through and score. Benz and
Bilge have heen the main cogs in the
Pioneer oiicusc, both scoring fre-
quenlly in the last two games. The
long center is especially good at fol-
lowing up the shuts of his teammates,
and he has been chic to hold his own
with every cenlcr he has played
against this season. The Pioneer
captain is in third place in the Valley
standings, llnd loads in free throwing.

The lineup that worked together so
successfully in the last two games,
will undoubtedly start F 'day. Wing
has been steadily improving as a.
guard, and Gelvin works well at for-
ward, playing an exceptionally line
floor game, A squad of eight or ten
men will accompany Coach MacEachr
run on the trip.
