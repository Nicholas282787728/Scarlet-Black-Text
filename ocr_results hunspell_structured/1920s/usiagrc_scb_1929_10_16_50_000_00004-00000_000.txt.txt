Each of the men’s dorms will enter
a float. The parade will form at
Chicago hall, proceed through town
and out to the game. A committee
of judges from the faculty will pick
the winner in the parade, to whom a
ten-inch cup is being offered by the
Student Council.

At 2 p. m., Grinnell will clash with
the Washington Bears in their ﬁrst
Missouri Valley struggle.

is known to have a heavy and fast
team, one which, according to J. C.

Truesdale, who has seen the Bears;

play, is far better than the Drake-
Washington score would indicate. A

hard fought game before what should ,

be the biggest Homecoming crowd in
years is therefore in prospect for
Saturday. Hundreds of Diamond
Jubilee visitors are expected to at-
tend the game.

‘Two special features are being

occur at that time.

The driveway from Eighth avenue
to Ward ﬁeld will be closed Saturday
as a safety measure hoth hefore and
after the game. Parking space is
provided from Tenth avenue, and
automobiles will use Tenth avenue
both before and after the game.

The drive from Eight avenue cuts
right beside the exits from the stand
and field and is a danger spot unless
cars keep off it, and come from the
north into the parking space. There
is ample parking space and each car
will be spotted as it comes in.

Ten-Dances to be Held .

After the game Saturday. ten-
dances will be held in nearly all the
cottages at the quadrangle. That
evening will witness two‘big social
functions. In the men's gymnasium,
Grant's Iowans will furnish ‘music for
the annual Homecoming dance. Fea-
tures of the dance will include de—
corations in tire college colors, with
silver trimmings and programs with
a cut of the college on them. A
novel feature dance during intermis-
sion will present a square dance by
several old pioneers. Robert Steven-
son and Leta Riniker are in charge.
