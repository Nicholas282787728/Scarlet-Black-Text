COLLEGE STUDENTS Aim WAR

Those who heard Dr. Fridtjof Nansen Monday CV8-
Ding heard a man of recognized importance in world af-
fairs paint so graphic, so terrible a picture of Wllﬂt war
is. that his declaration that "another great war must
never occur" seemed almost unnecessary. Because Dr.
Nansen combined a passionate earnestness with Wide
personal experience his convictions on war left a deep
impression on the students who attended.

Of the conclusions that may be drawn [tom his talk,
this one in particular stands out: that in the process of
milking future Wars impossible, coilege educated men
must play a. leading pftrt. Dr. Nansen did not phrase his
his words exactly in this manner, but he did stress edu-
cation as an important step in abolishing war.

Creation of a mass spirit'ngainst war was pointed
out the other night as the sel'ution for intematlunal dif—
ficulties. Now how may such a spirit be fostered”

TEE GRINN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Principally by aggressive leadership that combines it
knowledge of psychology with a knowledge of such subs
iccfsasblstory, economics, sociology and chemistry. If a
man is to lead in any movement, he must first make an
appeal to the masses, but he must also have an array of
facts to effectively down opposition that is bound to
come.

Because of these two factors necessary for con»
structive leadership, college educated men are peculiarly
fitted to take such c position. To them will go the task
of trying to counteract the influence on the popular
emotions of jingoistlc leaders and newspapers with ln~
telligent condemnation of the war system such as Dr.
Nansen gave the other night.
it is daily becoming more and more necessary that colr
lcge students in general, and Griunell students are repre-
sentative of the class, should equip themselves for this
position of leadership by including in their work courses
which may give the desired background and by an active
interest in international affairs of the day

Only in this way can the steady filtering of col-
lege mcu and women into the activities of the world
mean what it should for the prevention of any great war
in the future, a war which, in Dr. Nansen's words,
”would be the death of western civilization,"

NEED FOR A FIEIIDIIOUSE

After ten years of effort, Grinncll has captured a.
Missouri Valley track championship. Doped to finish
high in the standings, but not to triumph, the Pioneers
have done the unexpected. And while Grinnell stu-
dents as well as all those interested in Griunell rejoice,
the consideration cannot be kept down as to why in
the past Grinnell track teams have invariably been
“doped to place high. but hardly to win the meet."
Why, too, did lflst year’s tennis team, probably the best
ever to represent the school, lose many of its matches
up the southern spring vacation trip which it could have
won later in the season?

The finswcr may be found by examining the facili-
ties which Grinnell has for indoor sports in our pres
ent men's gymnasium. 'Here the basketball team is
forced to play a style of game which the small floor
and low ceiling seriously handicap. Here Grinnell's
track squad must try to develop into at championship
team cu ft small and inadequate track. And as for the
tennis squad, their sole opportunity to round into con-
dition must come through a game of solitaire with the
wall of the gymnasium as an opponent. If they take
another spring trip this year and win the majority of
their matches, it can hardly be attributed to early sea-
son conditioning.

The best that can be said for our present facilities
is that they lead to the “triumph of the individual over
the system," and even this is doubtful tribute In athletic
prowess, where the coaching system almost invariably
improves individual nbility.

When Grinnell college begins another building pros
gram, as it will undoubtedly do in the near future, first
among its considerations should come the real need of a
Iield house, where the physical side of a liberal educa~
tion may he really developer], where the advantages: of
the latest facilities in athletic equipment may be avail-
able to Pioneer teams of the future, as such facilities
are at present to cur competitors in the Missouri Valley
conference. E. D. A.

leap of 21 feet 5 inches in the broad
jump swamped all other attempts.

Joe McKee’s sensation drive to first
place in the 440-yard dash was an.
other fcntur-c of a meet spainkled libr
erally with brilliant performances.
After trai ng by twenty yards with
a 1pr to go, the Pioneer captain let
loose a burst of spend that carried
him safely by the pack, into first
place. Felletier ran a fine race to
finish fcurth in this event.

Sam Beck, diminutive Pioneer
speedster stayed with the fast ﬁeld
to finish third in a race that was
marked by a blanket finish of the
first three men. Parks, Drake, won
the event in :5.4 secunds.
Hensley performed in fine style for
the Pioneers, garnering two thirds in
th hurdle races, and tieing for second
in the pole vault. This boy appears
to hear prospects of developing into
a great allrftruund star an the ciu-
ders, and should swell the Pioneer
totals considerably in the meets that
are to come.
The winning Pioneer relay team
was composed of Miner, Mark, Taylor
and McKee.
Holleuheck, Creighton star, ran a
fine race to cop the half iner event,
and in addition pressed Faulkner of
the Aggies for first in the mile run.
Faulkner was a double winner, tak-
