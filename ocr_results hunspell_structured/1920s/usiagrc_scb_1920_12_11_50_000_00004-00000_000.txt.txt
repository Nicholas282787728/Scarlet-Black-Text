Gi'illnell's fault. we have heen en-
gaged in a war a for four years ii~
naneial conditions have been absolute-
ly upset. This has hit Grinnell, not
any harder, but just as hard as it has
every other college in the United
states Every other college and uni-
versity is facing exactly the same sit-
nation, But because of that, it be-
comes a challenge to us
Must Get Millions
"We have necessity at the pleseht

time for the raising of a million alid‘

a halt dollars. This will put us on a
[Ire-war basis, This is what that
means. it Griunell had a thousand
dollars invested at 6% before the war
she had an income of $60, She is still
getting that $60, but how much is that
$60 worth at the present time. It is
worth $30, We have got to have just
twice as much money to he on the
same basis as we had before. We
have got to have $2.000,000 more,
. We are talking in big figures, and
big facts, because we have to. How is
the student body going to go about it.
The General Education Board, a group
of big business men, have said to us
that they will give us $500,001) if you
will raise a million dollars in the
state or Iowa, For every $2.00 we get
here, they will put a dollar with it
We cannot afford to miss that oppor-
tunity. That means that for every
dollar we invest we are getting 50%.
Can we miss an investment like that?
Is Stiltlcllis’ Move

“We are prone to Sit back In our
seats and say 'Why Can’t President
Main go out and come home in a row
months with the mi on dollars stuck
in his pocket’. President Main has
come to the end of his rope so far as
getting any more money from the
capitalists of Iowa, the capitalists of
the East, or the capitalists of the
West. until he can go out and say
"Look what the student body of this

college is doing for their college.
Look what the state or Iowa is doing
lfov this college." So it is up to you
and me. The Education board has

 

‘given us until Jilly 15 to raise this.

'million dollars. The Education hoard
"has such confidence in us and our abil—
i ~ to do this that they have already
given us 5% interest on this $500,000
{or two years. .
l "We have been going on for year ,
sliding along, trusting in the Lord and
President plain for support, We have
supported the nethitics or the school
with pep and enthusiasm but now wei
are going to get out and yell tor the:
thing upon which everyone oi our ace
tivities aré dependent I am talking
for Grinuell. We are all going to
'work for Grinnell, and not for any one
particular organization.
Selling College
"At the present time your job iSi
to go out, especially this Cliristmas‘
vacation and turn, each one of you,
into a little selling agent for Grinnell,‘
We are going to put Grinncll helore
the state so many times heiore July
15, that the whole state will know
what Grinnell is doing.
Vinsc‘l Sperrher
r Kenneth Vinsel, the next speaker-,1
gave a number of iacts and arguments
which could be used in college Dubs
licity.
l “It isn't when we are here, that Wél
think about the college," he said
"It is the last thing we tlrink about,
but it you go away iroin hero, to thei
east coast, to the west coast, and
say that you are from Grinnell, nine
times not or ten, the people you are
talking to will have heard or Grilinell.
Griunell has a standing in the United
states winch any college would be
proud of, We have publications of
which any college would he proud. We
have more publications than any col—
lege of our size in the United States,
and we should be proud of them. Any
nniver rty would be proud of them, It
you compare Gl'imiell with the other
colleges or the state, in teaching stair,
buildings; athletics, in anything, Grirr
uell comes out ahead. There are no
such buildings in the state as those
we have here. The dormitories are
the best place tor men to live in that
can be found any place. The quads

Take the faculty, They are noted the l
‘state over, and even the United states‘
over. Get away irom the school

E‘I know that man. I am from the col—l
Iege where he taught.’

The college needs these buildings, and

 

It has to have the teams to:
keep up its standing.

They come back to see the school. In

proud we went thei-,e proud of thcl
