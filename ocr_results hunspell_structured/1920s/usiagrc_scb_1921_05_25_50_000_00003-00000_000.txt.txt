A RROW

CluemPeabady ﬁcalncfﬂﬂy mo

tion on Wednesday evening, May 18,
at the A. R. H. theatre, presented an
original dramatization of a short story
by Margaret Prescott Montagrre en—
titled “England to America". its
dramatic possibilties were fully and
skilliully realized in the stage version,
which was arranged in three scenes.
The dialogue was strong and the ac-
tion developed with smoothness and
economy. The camstrophe in the final
scene had been well prepared for in
the preceding episodes and was high—
ly ellective and convincing, 'There
is enough material in the story for a
full length drama.

The opening scene occurs in the
headquarters of the British Flying
Corps on the Western Front in July
1917. Captain Cheviot Sherwood, who
is commander of a squadron. suggests
to Lieutenant Car-y of Richmond, Vir-
ginia, just about to have a week's
leave, that he spend it at Sherwood's
home in England, which arrangement
is agreed to. The second scene opens
with the arrival of Cary at the Sher-
\vood’s. The family had given three
sons to the service. The youngest
had fallen early in the war, the sec-
ond son, Gerald, was at home blinded,
and the day after Cary had left the
front Captain Cheviot had been killed.
The news had reached the family, but
its members with characteristic Erit-
ish garneness had decided that the
news shorrld be kept from Cary so as
not to spoil his brief week of respite
before returning to the field. There
is a tenseness and an air ot forced
cheer-fulness in the following scenes.
At the close it becomes necessary to
tell Car-y that his friend is no more.
The audience had also up to this time
been kept in ignorance of Cheviot‘s
late. It is a question whetlrer-_tlie
catastrophe worrld have been more
powerful if the audience had been
made aware of this fact at the begins
ning of the second scene. The writer
inclines to the belief that it would,
and that all the situations would have
gained in reality and poimrancy.

The cast, an excellent one, was
chosen after a series oi competitive
tryouts. As a whole the members of
it are to be commended for their sins
cer-rty and lifelikeness, as well as for
the evident care in preparatron. Every
part was pertectly committed. It is
no disparagernent of other members of
the cast to say that the chief honors
fell to Ronald Williamson as Captain
Cheviot Sherwood, who gave a splenv
did impersonation of‘ the clean-cut
English soldier with a keen apprecia-
tion for the fine type of young Amer»
ican who enter-ed the air service— ex-
emplified in Lieutenant Cary: and o
George Harnagel as Cary. The lint;
had a difficult though sympathetic,
role and he compassed it completely.
Robert McCrath as the blinded Cap-
tain Gerald was also very efrectivc as
was Evelyn Cbanner as Lady Sher—
wood. The Rector was played with
too much conventional smirking and
nosing. The part called for simple
and natural acting.

The play as a whole is a convincing
plea for a better understanding and
a firmer friendship between the two
great branches of the Angluesaxou
race. and merits repetition. The set-
tings were careful and adequate.
Minute attention to detail was every»
where in evidence. The production
relleeted great credit on Mrs. Hallie
r. Flanagan who directed it. The new
formanee was one o itne best, if not
the best, of the original dramatiza-
tions that have been presented this
season in Alumni Reclmtion Hall.
