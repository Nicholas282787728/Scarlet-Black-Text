After a week oi conlpmratively light
practice. the Pioneers are in good
shape [or the iinal clash oi the sell
son when the Washington Pikers
furnish the opposition at st. Louis
Thanksgiving day. The iii-st tew
days of the week were devoted main--
ly to resting up, while the last two
nights have found the regulars in
scrimmage with the yearlings.

liceter and Moran have been drilling‘
in place-kicking and the Scarlet and
Black eleven will not he weak in that
respect Thursday. The great handi—
cap to the team will he the losses of
Seeland, Cathcart and nose all of
whom will be unable to don the mole-
skins because of injuries.

The Washington eleven which will
battle the Pioneers is said to he the
best eleven that over wore the Red
and Green on a loothall gridiron. The
Piker eleven is strong and. has grown
more powerful as the season has
progressed, as a careful study of the
scores will indicate.

Higgins Deserves Respect

Although this year coach Bob His
gln's men have failed to win a game,
they have nevertheless leit cleat
marks of respect on every gridiron
they have trod. The very first game
found them outplaying the Drake
eleven a great part of the game, but
losing by a s to 0. score.

Alter dropping a game to the s. M.
U, Mustangs and playing a scoreless
tie with the oklahoma Aggies, the
Red and Green awoke. They next
met the Ames Cyclones and for three
thrilling periods surprised the Valley
by outplaying Johnnie Eehm and his
cohorts. when the fourth quarter
started Washington was leading. 13—7.
Then it was that Allies brought its
tamed aerial attack into play and
stole the game, counting three touch-
downs before the tinal gun was tired.

Give Tigers Real Battle

Against the undeteated Missouri
Tigers two weeks ago the rejuvenated
Pikers gave the “show-me" gridsters
a great battle, finally losing 1470. The
iield was muddy and the lighter
Washington line was at a considerable
disadvantage. Nevertheless, the score
stood 7—0 with thbington threaten-
"lng to score until the last minutes of
play. Today the Plkers are hattllng
the Oklahoma Sooners at Norman.
the outcome of which will give Grin-
nell a good guage of the strength of
the Red and Green.

The ‘Pikers have a tricky backfield
shirt, a smart iield general in Hayes
and a husky, ploughing rollback in
Captain Levy, who does most ot the
line bucking and all the puntlng for
his team. They also have a forward
passing attack which is reported to
he dangerous and hard to break up.

The Valley tilts today are teatured

meeting or deadly rivals and the out-
come of these struggles will have a.

the final standings.

Should the Bulldogs defeat Ames
and the layhawkers down Missouri
the championship will go to Drake on

Kansas Victory appears rather Slight
and the Tigers ought to end the sea-
