thc 220 yards in while in col-

track coach proved that,

“In lus younger days on his ruthe
er's [arm near Greenfield, 1a., Hoyt
had aspirations to he a sprinter. He
had a pony which was the fastest colt
in the country side. Hoyt decided
that he would t in against the pony
before he entered into competition.

”over any long distance he [ound
that he had no chalice against the
horse, but over a. Iittyryitrd route with
a rider on the pony and running
around the peg halirway down the
[il‘tyrym'tl stretch, Hoyt found that he
could run pretty Close to the horse.

“He could start and get under full
stride as quickly as the horse and he
could cut the corner at the peg closer
than the horse, With his brother rid-
ing the pony, Hoyt trnirled all snm~
nler in fiftyryard sprints. By late
August he was beating the horse pret~
=ty rcmrlsrly, and when he went to
high school in the fall he reported for
the track team.

"In his senior year in high school,
competing for Greenfield, Hoyt won
the IOU-yard flash in the national in-
te‘rscholsstic meet at the University
of Chicago, setting a new national
prep record oi :09.8.

"In college he won the 220 in the
Conference meet at Chicago. At the
Drake relays that year he won the 220
in .4, equalling the World's record
around a turn, In that field he der
tented such stars as Smith of Michi-
gan, eastern intercollegiate champion,-

Smith of Wisconsin, Big Ten c‘ham- ’

plan and Shearer of Drake, Missouri
Valley champion,

"The following year he left coir
legs to enter the naval aviation ser-
vice. His track gcrocr was ended. the
year after he got out of the service by
a severe case of typhoid fever.

Rice Talks on Science
And Christianity at Y.

“When we stop and Consider what
science has done, can we still be
Christians" was the subject discussed
by Rev. H. C. Rice/ oi the Baptist
church at Y Thursday evening.

He hrought out that this was one
or the greatest problems contronting
the ministry today. Science has der
strayed both heaven and hell, pushing
them out to infinity. It has substiue
ed the theory or evolution for special
Creation and has even altered our
ideas of Christ.

Mr. Rice believes that
theories do not necessarily destroy
our faith~thztt because some state—
ments of the Bible are incorrect the
entire book is not proven wrong. Ev-
olution is a long and tiresome process
but God is behind it all. It doesn't
make any diiicrcnce whether the min
icles are true or not—Jesus alone is
prool enough that God is a friend oi
human beings.

“Jesus was a human

today he would be interested in atllr
lctics, the dramatic club and all
wholesome college activities. But
Jesus had in addition the spirit or
God. To me this proves that any liv-
ing heng can have the spirit of God.
This is the greatest thought in Chris-
tianity."
