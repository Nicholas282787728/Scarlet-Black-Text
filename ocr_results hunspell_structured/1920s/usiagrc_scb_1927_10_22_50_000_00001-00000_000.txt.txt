Reviewer Asserts,

SEYBOLT DIREGTS COMEDY

Howard Peck. Leading Character,
Assumes Role Well; Others
Play Accordingly.

By Katherine Sillli’llls.

Pii'nles' treasure in an iron-bound
sea chest; an old English country
house breathing the atmosphere of re-
spectabllit, a hero whose innate con-
ventionality is quite wrecked by tales
oi pirate ancestors; admirable set-
ting, lighting, and support; all these
factors last night went into making
the Dramatic club play, “Captain Ap-
plejack," one which truly fitted the oc-
casion of Homecoming.
rme the drop curtain, which was
a murderous appearing aiiair oi black
ornamented with a death's head, to
the last detail oi rigging on the pir—
ate ship, the setting was completely in
harmony with the 'play itself, which
was under the direction or ottille
Turnbull Seybolt, French doors, the
setting at acts one and three maintain-
ed the air of respectability which so
expressed the character of Ambrose
Applejobn. The setting ior not two
had in it the tang oi salt air, and the
clink oi Spanish gold, ior it was an
admirable pirate ship, with cabin win-
dows overlooking a deck which might
well have been strewn with blood and
bones.

Lighting Effective.

A feature which added much to the
shivering oi the audience‘s timbers
was the lighting which effected trans-
ition irom reality to Ambrose's hairv
raising dream with scarcely a hitch,
and gave the haunting character to
the ancestral and respectable walls
of Amhrose’s living room.

Howard Peck, completely in characA
tar as Ambrose Applejohn, at once
timorous and valiant, conservative and
daring, romantic and absurdly prac-
tical, carried the leading role with
satisiying success. The iussiness OI
bachelorhood, the swaggering roar oi
Captain Applejack who bellowed
“Scum!" to his luckiess crew were
achieved with equal ease by this actor
who has the ilare for picking up a cat-
cby line and throwing it at the audi-

Drake‘s Only \Victory Has Been
Over Simpson College 011
Last Wednesday.

Grinnell meets Drake today in the
annual Homecoming encounter which
always proves the culmination oi the
rivalry between the two schools.

The Drake Bulldogs, in their games
so iar this season. have not iared
much better than Grinnell. In their
first game oi the season against the
Navy at Annapolis, they showed a
marked lack oi experience, and were
trampled on to the count oi as to 6.
In their second game, they entertained
the Univers v oi Pittsburgh at Des
hioies and did not fare much better.
They were beaten 32 to o.

In their third game against Simpson
college, however, they tasted the cup
or victory, winning 20 to 5 over Simp-
sons's iorward~passing combination.

In the Pittsburgh game, the Drake
team was handicapped by the absence
of Captain “Bill" Cook, fullback, who
had difficulties with the coach and
turned in his suit, but these difiicul-
ties have been patched up, and Cook
will start the game against Grinnell.
Cook is the only senior on the team,
all the other members being eligible
ior at least one more year of compe-
tition alter this present season.

Hus l’ovrerlnl Blwkfield.

Drake‘s backfield, although it con-
tains two sophomores, Jack Barnes
and Stanford Arts, will stack up very
iormidahly. Captain Cook is a tull-
hack of more than ordinary ability at
hitting the line. "Barney" Meyers is
a quarterback who has a fairly level

l head, and can be counted upon to do

the right thing at the right time. Arts
and Barnes, the two sophomores, are
perhaps the most shining stars in the
Drake backfield. Barnes has a good
high school reputation, making the
allrstate team while attending West
high school in Des Moines. Arts was
a star in high school also and pos-
sessed much speed.

The Drake backiield has a weatlh oi
dependable reserves, Cocknyne, who
scored the only Drake touchdown
against the Navy is as good‘as any at
the ilrst string backs. thcek, who
was a star of the that magnitude at
Washington High oi Cedar Rapids is
capable at both end and backfield. He
gave a good account of himself against
both Pittsburg and the Navy. Other
very dependable backs Who will prob-
ably sees action against Grinnell are
Ryan, Nesbitt and Gordon. The latter
has shown up very well at quarterback
during recent practice sessions.

Drake's line, from all early season
indicatlons will be able to give a very
good account of itself against Grin-
nell today. A friendship of high
school days will change to temporary
rivalry when "Chuck" Fall and
“Chuck" Delmege face each other at
end. Both at these men attended
North Des Moines high,

Line Shows Up Well.

in the Pittsburg game both of the
Drake ends, Delmcge and Pcttibone,
showed enough fight to make up for
anything that they might lack in abili—
ty. The Drake tackles, Hoillday and
Helser, though not phenomenal play—
ers, can be counted on to do their part
in attempting to defeat their old ri-
vals. The Drake guards, though some—

Drake, Grinnell Open
36th Encounter Toda y

Drake Has Won Eighteen, Grinnell Sixteen
‘ Games; Jinx Broken Last Year.

When the Drake Bulldogs and the
Grinnell Pioneers trot out on Ward
iield this afternoon it will he the on-
ening oi the thirty-sixth encounter be
tween the two schools.

Star-ting back in 1896, Grinncll and
Drake met ior the ilrst time on the
gridiron, and the Pioneers, tben pink
clad instead oi the more manly colors
oi scarlet and black, scrambled rough-

sliod over the Bulldogs by a forty- ‘

point margin, The following year,
1897, was practically a repetition with
the Grinnel! eleven Winning by a. 33
to 0 score.

One Tic Recorded.

In 1898, 1900, and 1901, two games
were played each year. This practice
was abandoned in 1902, in order that
each team might have the extra week
to use in playing some other team.
During the thirty-one year series the
Drake teams have Won eighteen games
while Grinnell has captured the long
and of the score in sixteen. In 1920
the two teams battled to a 7 to 7 tie.
the only instance of a. Lie between the
two schools on record.

Coach L. L. (Fuzz) Watt Will send
practically the same lineup against the
Bulldogs this afternoon that he has
used at the initial play of all the
games thus far on the schedule. One
change seems certain, however, caused
by the need of a~new tackle to fill
Klinefelter's position. The big tackle
received a severe sprain to one hf his
lect in the scrimmage against the
[rash on Tuesday evening, and the in-

l‘ured member has tailed to respond
to treatment in a satisfactory manner
it is probable that Dwight Brooke,
husky reserve lineman, will receive
the call at the vacant berth. Brooke
has been periorming in a fine manner
in the stlii scrimmage sessions this
week and is looked upon as practically
the equal of any man on the line,
rail Recovers

Chuck Pail seems to have recovered
suiiiciently irom his ankle injury, ins
currcd in the Nebraska game, to take
his place at left end. Briggs will be
seen at right end on defense. with
Captain Dav-is switching irom his reg-
ular tackle berth to take the wing po-
sition on offense. This move was
made because at the Pioneer leader's
ability to catch passes.

Cleland and Parish will probab-
ly start the game at guards, although
Coach Watt may decide to start Kiesel,
stalwart sophomore guard prospect,
who became eligible last week. brad-
ley and Heldrldge have been alternat-
ing at the center position all or this
week. and it is a toss-up as to whom
will draw the assignment tor the
starting lineup. Both men will be seen
in action this aiternoon without
doubt.

Mclntire, who it was feared would
be out oi today's game because oi a
had attack of balls on his arms,, is
again in good shape and will lrc seen
at the signal calling position. Moln-

The grad had a chance to decide the
true worth oi the crop of next sear
sou's sophomores when two trosh
clevens met this morning in a mortal
grid-battle, The Blacks, headed by
Claude Richie, the outstanding hali-
back of the freshman squad, tried to
expound the science of football to the
Reds captained by Humphrey, the bus-

ky tackle who has been a thorn in the
side oi the varsity all season.
'There was not much ditierence'in the
strengths of the two teams. Perhaps
the Blacks had the smoother backs
held with Richie and Douglas carrying
the ball and Ferguson and nut: lead-
ing the interference. The Reds,
however, claim Alex, the only perc
souiﬁcation of streaked lightning on
the squad. Miner proved a. threat
when he used the ability with which
be snares passes against the varsity.
Hakendorf’s backing the line insured a
strong deetnse for the Reds.

The Bolshevik line did have a
slight edge because of the presence
of Humphrey and his big partner Lund
as tackles. There seemed to be little
choice in guards. A hard-hitting pair
oi Blocks was pitted against a hiu'd—
hitting pair of Reds.‘ Neither team
was weak nt ends. The iour play-
ing today were rangy men, who sel—
dom miss tackles. At center, although
Fee is the larger and can stand more
punishment. Norton, his Black oppon-
ent, has earned the reputation of back-
ing the line on defense“ Both men
