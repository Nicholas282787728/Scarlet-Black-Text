A GOOD PLAN

One of the most recent steps in col-
lege circles, and one that promises
much for the future, was the meeting
of student leaders at Ames and mer-
chants ot the town which was held
there last week. The purpose of the
conference, which was called by the
Ames Commercial Club, was to coin
sider ways and means at promoting
greater cooperation between the town
and the college, particularly between
the merchants and the students.

The history of this movement is
rather interesting ind is greatly sim-
ilar in many respects to conditions
here in our own community. For a
number or years the college trade with
‘the downtown merchants at Amos has
not been what it should, This lack
of interest has been relt especially by
the clothiers and shoemen oi the town
altho it has extended ingeneral to all
the various houses that have had busie
ness relations with the students. i-low-
cver, despite lax condit' a ,the iner-
chants took no definite action until

' recently when the matter was brought
to the attention of the Commercial
Club and it was decided to make a
drive for a re-estnblishment oi: busi-
ness relations with the general slur
dent body at the state College. The
first step in this campaign was taken
last week when the otliclnls of the
Chamber of commerce extended an
invitation to the presidents. or use
various rraternitiea and to other lead-
ing students to meet with them md
to discuss conditions. at this meet
ing. the merchants decided to do all
in their power to draw college trade
and are planning to make a wide-
spread appeal tor student support.
This will he done by the introduction
of lines of goods that are particularly
attractive to college students, and by
an intensive advertising campaign in
the college publications,

This, however, while it helps, does

lations. At the present time thou-
sands or dollars worth oi business that
might easily be attracted to
stores goes to other towns simply be-
cause the average merchant does not
make enough of a Specialized appeal
to the Student. It may be said ﬁlial
the merchants are carrying their reg—
ular lines and that these are good
ones. This is undoubtedly true but,
while we cannot claim to quality as

local

advertising experts, it is a well known
fact that a. sgecial appeal must be
made to college trade if satisfactory
results are to be obtained. This does
not mean that extra. stocks must he

It would seem that the Allies mer—
chants have hit upon a real solution
for the problem of cooperation he-
tweon town and college and that they
orc well upon the road to a better un-
derstanding and more prosperous l'ea
lations with the students. This is a
plan that might well be tried in other
college communities.

PAY TOUR BILLS

In the midst of all Lbe hurry and
bustle collected with the near apr
proach or vacation it seems rather
prosaic to slap and talk business, pare
ilculal‘ly ﬁnancial matters, and yet
this is an important subject that
should not be overlooked in the ﬁnal
rush of work, ‘

College students are supposedly in
schunl to prepare themselves for their
life work, and. yet there is no other
class that is so careless with regard
to financial matters. Nearly every
organization in the school has its own
account with the merchauu and the
banks, and almost an equal number
or them are indebted to some extent-
some in tact have seldom been out of
debt and in many cases this has been
extended over a period of years, with
a gradual increase of the amount that
is charged on the books or the Grin-
nell merchants. The long term carry-
ing ot bills is in direct violation of
all laws 0! banking and of credit, and
yet special exceptions are frequently
made because of the class with which
the business is carried on. Unfortun-
lately, many persons, finding them-
selves always ahlc to rind credit, are
not ambitious enough to meet their
obligations promptly and slide farther
and farther into debt Such methods
are particularly prevalent among the
organizations, altho many students
have charge accounts and these too
are treouently carried for prolonged
periods.

This condition of indebtedness, par—
ticularly at the close of the year, is
not an unnatural one but it is not a
good business policy and as such
should not be continued. Not only
does it work hardship on the merchant
who is asked to carry the account of
an organization from year to year, but
it is also hard on the men who must
eventually meet the obligation, E-
forts should be made by all of the Gir
ganizations and by all of the individ-
uals to see that their dues are col—
lected and that their bills are settled

Editor Scarlet and Black,
Dear Si .

Last spring. after a year oi at-
tempting to assimilate mysell into
Grinnell College life, when l was be.
ginning to feel enthusiasm and pride
in Grinnell growing upon me, I met
an ‘odd surprise, one which at the
time confused me and even threw a
damper upon my loyalty to the school.
it was caused by remarks which I
heard expressed by seniors, many of

class.
seniors, more than all others, are
supposed to have the good of the
school at heart, to believe in ii, and
to do all they can to help it grow and
prosper. But last spring, and again
this year, when I hear some of them
saying "I’ll sure be glad to get out of
this place," or "I'm sick of the way
the administration treats us," and
again “They think that we are a
bunch of kids and are always trying
to slip something over on us," one
wonders just what the trouble is, es
pecially if that person is a freshman
forming his opinions and college
ideals.

Whether these objectors had any
reason for feeling disgusted with the
school for personal reasons i do not
know.’ No doubt there were certain
ones who were prejudiced. but after
another year in the college commun-
ity I believe that I can see‘ the big
reason tor the spirit suggested above.
The faculty and student body have co-
operated this year better than usual,
especially for the endowment. But
haven't they been a long way trom
working together as they shouldl We
have just adopted a newbstudent coun-
cil constitution which is supposed to
make cooperation between the diner-
ent organizations and the faculty pos~
sible. But help as this may, it cannot
be a complete success unless the iacul-
ty is willing to have coniidence in the
student or to trust them with respon-
sibility. This i believe the taculty is
tailing to do. Let me sight an ex»
ample, ‘

At Christmas time while the stud—
ents were home, the college hired
some one to go thru their private
rooms to search for library books.
All tound were taken back to the lie
lil‘al’y and if one was undated lor, the
occupant or that room in which it was
found was the some as called a thici
