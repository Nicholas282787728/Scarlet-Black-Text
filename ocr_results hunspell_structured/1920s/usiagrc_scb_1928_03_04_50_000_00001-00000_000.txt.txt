addressing the joint meeting of the Y

wcro considered of tremendous ime
liortance by the speaker.

Mr. Blanshard blamed the United
States for the “national litillol"'mirdSe.
“We are fond of our national honol,’
he said, "when it is connected with a
country whose navy isn’t as large as
ours.

"I will prophesy that the next war
in China will center around Mari-
chriria, and that the two sides will be
ariayed then: China, fndia, and Rus-
sia on one sid , Great Britain, .lapan,
and the United states on the other.
The immediate neeess is to bi-cah
the United states away from an rile
fiance in China with Japan and Great
Britain Out of this arrangement will
come permanent peace between the
United States and China,

Ruth suckow, ex ’14, is dcscribed as
“more penetrating, more sympathetic,
and in effect more accurate" than
Sinclair Lewis, in a review of her la-
test novel, “The Bouncy Family,"
which appeared in the book section of
the Chicago Daily News of chnese
day, F‘elu'uary 2‘). The review is writ
ten by Wayne Gard, sistant profes-
sor of journalism at Grinhell.

Mr. Gard finds that “The Bonhey
Family" should hold the iiitcrcst of
any reader except the one who de—
mands ah abduction in the first Chane
(er and a murder in the second,” and
concludes that “its picture of every-
dl ' life in midwestern America is as
convincing and as memorable as any
that has yet been produced,”

Cdpmin Meyers Goes on Scoring
Spree to Aid In Defeat
0f Pioneers.

FINAL SCORE IS 27 TO 17

Fail Is High Scorer for Gz'inrnell
With Two Field Goals And
One Free Throw.

Unable to get under way until the
second half, Grinnell lost the final
basketball game of the season to
Drake university Wednesday night at
Des Muines by it score of 27-17. The
Pioneer's defeat was largely due to
their inability to cover Capt. Barney
Myers, who scored eighteen points,
and to a ragged offense, especially in
the opening period, but the team was
obviously worn out from the strain of
playing laur- hard games in six clays.

Myers opened the scoring with three
long baskets in quick succession from
the lelHiaiul corncr or the court, fol»
lowing with a free throw, After
Parisho had brought the Bulldogs
total to nine, Davis finally found the
hoop for Griuueil’s five points. For
the remainder of the half, the teams
fought on fairly even terms, the
score being tars at tlic curl of the pet--
lotl,

The last half was featured by a
stronger nflonsivc on the part of the
Pioneers, wliicli netted thciii fourteen
points to Drake' fifteen, and by in-
oi-cas lg roughness which end—
ed with the ejection late in the
game at Simpson or Drake anti Davis
ahtl Fail of Griuncll. Starting with
Fall‘s basket soon after the opening
whistle, Grihnell spiii-tctl and brought
the score to 16-10. only to have Barnes
and Myers rctdliate for Dralie to give
the Bulldogs a ten point lead. From
this point Glmnell held Drake even
for the remainder of the gamc. Many
of the Pioneer's shots found the
hoop, only to bounce off unexpectedly.
Myers was outstanding for Drake,
while Davis and Coggeshall looked
best [or Gi-innell.

The game left. the Count even be—
tween Grinnell and Drake for the
season and also marked the close of
the basketball careers of four Pioneer
players These are: Davis and Peter-
