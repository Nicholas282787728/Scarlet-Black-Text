Myers Gives Data
on Unemployment

'The displacing of

unemployment problem in at least
one industryithap of cutting men’s
clothing—eaccording to a recent
study of this industry made by
Prof. Robert J. Myers of the econom—
ics department or Grinnell college.
Writing in the Journal or Political
Economy, Mr. Myers states that
while unemployment insurance and
an employment exchange have help-
ed those temporarily out of work,
nothing has been done for those
forced out of the industry altogether.

Professor Myers investigated par.
tieularly the question of What be-
came of Chicago clothings cutters
forced out of their trade by technical
changes. "After the lapse of several
years," he says, "only one-fourth of
these skilled men were engaged in an
occupation at all similiar to that

which they had left, and only one out
of five was in any closely related
trade; the the others were widely
scatterede The men had last an
average of more than five months
before getting any employment at
all, and almost half had changed
trades at least once after getting a
job. Almost half of the men earned
less than they had earned as cutters,

and in the other you're sure it is
good stuff,“ Mr. Lavell said. "That is
why so many Americans spend their
two weeks vacation in Canada. They
try to imbibe enough in that time to
last them all the rest of the year.
We became so disgusted with all the
drinking going on at the hotel where
we ﬁrst stayed, that we moved fur
ther north to a more secluded spot.
"Whenever a Chicagoan tells his
friends that he is going to Canada,
they all snicker,” he concluded, “bee
cause they can think of only one
reason for going to Canada. That
is why they call the provinces the
bar-room of North America."

Grinnell Outplaye Carleton

The Grinnell snuad showed a clear
cut advantage over the losers and
was never in serious danger as com-
pared with the eight for Carleton,

they far outgoined the Visitors from

' scrimmage and had the edge in the

air.

Coach Watt gave his men a rest
Monday afternoon and started his
dl'lll for the Creighton contest at
lOmaha on Thanksglving day with a
scrimmage Tuesday.

l If the Pioneers can trim the Blue-
jays as they are doped to do, it will
mean the best record since the
championship Pioneers of 1925 left
the gridiron. The Pioneers have lost
only one game, that being to Ames,
a nonvconference opponent. The Mis-
souri Valley record of Grinnell do'es
not show a loss and Creighton is not

‘doped to change the outlook.
