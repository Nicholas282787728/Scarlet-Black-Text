”There is more honor in having

iea than the crowned heads of Eue
rope,’l said Madame Bol‘gneyrl'lalnmcr
in an interview. Madame nainmer,
the noted Scandinavian actress, who
will appear in Ibsell’s "Hedda Gainer"
at the Colonial, April 5. has. acted for
the crowned heads or Elll'oxle, when
Kaiser Wilhelm ot Germany, Czar,
Nicholas of Russia, Emperor Francisl
Joseph ot Austria, King Constantine
ct Grecce, and many others who are
now without a crown, were among
them.

Madame Hammer does not bnlieve in ,
circus methods or puhlieity- and claims
that she is not at all interested in the
tact that she once appeared in the,
rolls of Ibsen's heroines heroic Euro.)
pean com-ts. "It is my purpose," she
said “to introduce a true, wholesome‘
and i spiring interpretation or lhscn,
and it is for that reason that I have
chosen to play before the college men
and women or America rather than to ‘
any other group. I know that with
them I shall get a sympathetic hear-
lug." The company with which Mada
