DR. DAVIS AND CHAPEL.

Be at chapel every morning next
week to hear Di: Davis. WAIT A
MINUTE heiore you say no. Do about
two minutes oi straight thinking ﬁrst.
Did you ever hear Dr. Davis speak?
If you have you will again. It you
haven't you should for these four rea-
sons:

1. You will like his speeches. Dr.
Davis is a live, vigorous, virilc man
himself and puts interest and en-
thusiasin into what he says. He is
giving master salesman’s talks in
"selling" roll 'on. , '

2. He is worth hearing, He is na—
tionally known and has a broad and
deep insight into our present-day
Problems. Tobe able to hear him is
worth something.

8. He will say something worth lls»
tening to. Dr. Dav-15’ experience
is' so rich and varied that none
who hear him here but will gain new
that. And coming, as he died, on the
heels of Professor Giddings he will be
especially worth hearing for the sake
OI. comparison and contrast.

'4. It you still absolutely know that
you will not like him anyway, at least
be honest enough to say so because
you have actually heard him several
times and decided for yourself. Don't
be like the freshman who told us the
other day that he had never read Kip—
ling "but I know I don't like him,"

Hear Dr. Davis.

E, PLURIBUS UNUM.

GIVE THE THERS THE It DUE.
’ The Scarlet and Block 0 Feb. 11
quotes the statement or Proiessor Gid-
dings regarding the first sentence at
the second paragraph oi the Declara»
tiou oi Independence. The distinguish-
ed Sociologist and the periodical both
lend their influence to the perpetua-
tion of an old error that is often
made on our college platlorm, on other
piatiorms and in public print.

This sentence of the Declaration of
Independencc in w ch we are inter-
ested reads thus- " 7e hold these
truths to be selfrol'lrlent: that all men
are created equal; that they are en-
dowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights; that among these
are liie, liberty and the pursuit oi
happiness." Please observe that the
word “free" is not there. it does not
say "tree and equal." To say that
would have been an evident absurdity.
for the colonists at that date owned
many slaves. This error has been
many times corrected in print, but it
still persists and is an excellent il-
lustration oi the adage that
dies hard."

Of smaller importance is the fact
that the Declaration says "created

equal,” not born equal. and “unillie'llr

able rights,” not "inalienable rights."
These errors are also common
public utterances.
Apologies to the Scarlet and Black,
which is usually quite accurate.

Thcioiiowiug explanatory statement is niadc hy the con'innltrcs:

ln espouse to a rather gencrul dosh-c ioi- nioic dctlnitc initirination coils
tuning the dancing rules, the Social Committee and Recreation Committee
met on Thursdoy cvcniug and decided to pnhli I the regulations as they now
stand. This liud not been done earlier on account oi the experimental charac—
ter oi the two special c 'Lc ~ioiis oi the dzbllcillg priVilcgc. In adopting the
plans for a gcncral re cation period to include dancing, it. was hoped that all
the desirable feature. oi a college coinniuiiitv play inie might be realized, and
the disadvantages oi special privilcgcs ioi a portion'oi the student body
might be avoided. It “as also hoped that the attendancc at public dances
might. hc ent eiy eliminated. It the recreation period docs not serve the
purposes for which it was designed then it should be abolished. Likewise
if the pr‘ ilcge to student members oi the town organizations ior attending the
regular organization dances is abused, this privilege should bc withdrawn
The social and Recreation committees believe that c restatement oi the regula-
tions, including the two extensions which are now being tried, will help very
much in clearing the present undesirable situation. A mass meeting oi the
girls was held last week with the same end in view, and the Women's League
Board have recommended that those who attend public dances herealtcr should
be sent llulne for a time. In the ioliewing smtement oi the regulations it will
be noted that provisions “"1, "4' and "5" are not new, while "2" and "3" have
been added this year. .

1. College dances may be held on the night before the college opens in
the Fall, on the night before the Thanksgiving. Christmas and Spring recesses,
between semesters, and on the night the college year closes. All plans ior
such dances shall be submitted to the Faculty Committee on Social Aifairs.

2. Dancing is permitted at a general recreation period, the details oi
which shall be worked out by a joint committee of the faculty and students.
The general policy shall be as follows:

Thomas c. Bieisdell in, who was in
Grinnell this week in the interests or
the student Volunteer movement, has
written an article for the Scarlet and
Black concerning the modern situa—
tion in India. HE is an authority on
the question, having been engaged in
mission work in the Hilaleya region
since his graduation from Pc‘nn State.
His article follows:

The must outstanding fact of mod»
ern Indian politics has been the devel—
opment inthc past year and anal: at an
answer on the part oi'thc British
government to the demand‘which has
arisen on every hand fmm the edu-
cated classes for a, more representa—
tive government. The statement by
President Wilson of his "fourteen
points" as the basis for the settlement
of peace between Germany and the
Allied Nations brought hope to India
that there might be a move on the
part cf Great Britain to g 'e Hume
Rule. In due time the British gov—
ernment announced that His Majesty’s
govcmluellt would be pleased to grant
complete responsible government. to
India, by successive stages.

Appoint Conimis, ion.

This was followed by the appoint—
men: of IL cummlssiun to investigate the
conditions in Intli . This commission
consisting oi the Secretary of State
for Imlizt and his advisers and help
or: from the government of India,
made a. [our of the country studying
the conditions and interviewing the
people, The result was ﬁnally an.
nounccd in the torso 01' what was
known as the "Molltagu-Cllelmsfol‘d
Reform Scheme," being named after
its two main authors. The whole plan
was based on giving into the hands
oi Indians a part oi the government,
the latter part including the handling
or ﬁnances and military and foreign
aiiairs,

This was followed on the pail: oi
the government by the announcement
of a new measure for dealing with
"revolutionavy" chme. This bill pul.
into 'lhe hands of the executive gov—
ernment and the pullce such large
powers that it caused protests irom
all over the country. A political
Strike was inaugel‘ated Which resulted
in Wide-spread rioting and ﬁnally in
the declaration of martial law in one
Whale province. It was at this time
that the now famous massacre oi the
defeuccless mob by a British general
took place, in which 400 were hilicd

New Dual Form of» Government In ‘ -'_
British India Attracting Notice

the announcement oi the passing of
the bill by Parliament giving India
a small degree of responsible gov-
ernment. The scheme, highly compli-
cated as it is, may prove of some help
in uuicting the unrest. It is the judg-
ment of experienced observers that the
trouble is iar more deep-seated than
any political trouble and lies in the
iundamental social changes which are
taking place as the result of the clash
between the western and eastern civil-
izations.

It would seem that the solution at
the diiiiculties lies in the application
to India of a constructive type at Ser—
vice, both on the part of the British
government and non-oiiicial agencies
such as the missions from both Britain
and America.
