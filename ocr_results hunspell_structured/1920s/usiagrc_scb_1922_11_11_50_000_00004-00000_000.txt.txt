‘IPS‘E DIXIT

GALILEO

 

There was much learning but
little real knowledge in Galileo’ s
time (1564—1641). Aristotle was
swallowed in bad Latin transla-
tions. Ipse dixit. No one checked
him by what seemed vulgar,
coarse experiment.

Galileo fought against the
dead hand of tradition. He did
not argue about Aristotle, but
put him to the test. Aristotle led
his readers to believe that of two
bodies the heavier will fall the
faster. Galileo simply climbed
to the top of the Leaning Tower
of Pisa and dropped two un-
equal weights. The “best peo.
ple’ were horriﬁed; they even
refused to believe the result—
that the weights reached the
ground in equal times.

“Look :11: the world, and ex-

periment, experiment,” cried
Galileo.

ular estimation, but Sulelm‘ail

Emperor, who swept through
Eastern Europe with ﬁre and

Vienna. Where is his magniﬁ.1

Galileo gave. us science—.

right .of experimental evidence.
Suleiman did little to help the
world.

Hardly an experiment is made
in modern science, which does
not apply Galileo’s results..
When, for instance, the phys' ,
lsts in the Research Laboratories
of the GeneralElectric Company
study the motions of electrons
inrariﬂed atmospherespr exper-
iment to heighten the efﬁciency .
of generators and motors, they,
follow Galileo’s example and.
substitute facts for beliefs.
