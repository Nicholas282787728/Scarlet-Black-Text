Delightful hrtorprclntious,
brimmit Technique

Depth of understanding and techni-
cal brrurancy characterized the recital
of Olga saiuaroff given last Friday in
Herrick chapel. Madame Samaroff‘s
program was formidable; a musical
giant alone could have performed lhe
feat. Madame samaroff was a Brah—
ma of the keyboard, skillful, saure.
able to achieve massive effects, remin-
iscent in the Chopin, of De racbman.

Her first group included a Each
fugue and the Beethoven sonata Opus
10, No. 2; both were played in an eyeh,
wellcdefined manner distinguished by
broad tonal effects and remarkable
clarity. We found Madame Samaroff
at her best in the last two movements
of the Chopin D minor sonata. Her m-
tel'prelatlvn struck as its keynote a
profound sense of sorrow, magnificent-
ly motivated and developed to a stirr-
ing climax.

Displays varying Moods

In her last group Madame Samaroff
exhibited a number of moods. The
"Clair do Lune" of Debussy found her
pemive; here was tone of bell-like
quality. Perhaps the most impressive
of the group was an entirely new in—
terpreiatiou of the Iiszt Rhapsody No.
12. This served as Madame Samar-
alf’s tour on force. For us there was
the unpleasant intrusion of a feminine
note in a composition essentially mas-
culine. But of Madame Samaroff’s ar-
tistry there can be no doubt. Herrin-
terpretation lacked nothing in vigor
or perfection, and to many a Liszt
rhapsody may mean soft cascades of
sound, We, brought up on the Peder-
ewski tradition, missed the thunder.

Madame Samaroff won a flattering
triumph from a large audience. She
was recalled again and again and res-
ponded generously with encores. Beer
thoven‘s “Turkish March” and “The
Ride of the Valker-ies" called forth
much applause. A Strauss waltz,
played without transcription, was a
novel close for the recital.

utive committee.

ically conducting the "Alumni Service
Campaign" the country has been divide

will have a chairman and a vice-
Chairman and similar officers for each

ization that, with the loyal and ener-
getic support of all nliimni.cnd ex—
students, the needs of Grinnell College
can be met without placing an undue
burden upon any particular group.

According to Mr. Holmes, there has
never been a time in the history of the
college when the needs were more ur-
gent to maintain the standing and
prestige of the institution.

Because the severity of Saturday’s
game, coupled with the extreme heat
of the after-noon. proved a telling drain
on the stamina of the team. Monday
night was devoted to a short signal
‘Pmcticé with the second string meli
scrimmagi'ng the mobs, while Tuesday
night was spent in blocking and tacks
ling. Saturday's game showed seve
eral weaknesses in the Pioneers play.
especially in the aerial attack. and con
siderable time will undoubtedly be
given the latter part of this week
to improve the passing game. Cen-
siderable time is also being spent in
following the ball, as the failure in this
branch of play had a telling effect in
the Drake fray.

In Good Condition.

The team is in good condition as
evidenced by the fact that there have
no serious injuries since the open-
ing game. Meeter is bothered some
with an infected foo.t but expects to
be fully recovered by the time the
team meets Coe. Wood and Scharn-
weber are again out in uniform. but
not yet able to withstand any sci—im-
mage. However. both hope to be back
in shape by the first of next week.
The addition of these two men will
make a great difference to thesouad.
as they are both experienced and can
be depended upon to plays good game.

Coe is recognized as one of the
strongest teams of the middle west
this year by virtue of their 1—7 tie with
Wisconsin, and their decisive victory
over Dubudue, so it will be one of the
most difficult games on the Pioneer
schedule. in Mowrey, Smith, and
Capmm Makeever. Coach Eby has n
backﬁeld trio to he rightly feared by
any team.

The open date this weekend Will
give the squad a good rest. and will
also give the coaches a chance to ex-
periment with possible new combina-
tions both in the backﬁeld and line in
order to get a smoother running aggre-
gation than the team that played
Di'ftke. As Coo has no game this
week either, they too have ample tune
in which to prepare for the Pioneer
invasion.

November 3, the night before the Pres«
identinl elwtton in this country, on the
question, "Resolved: That, this House
favors the rte-election 02 President
Coolidge." The debaters hﬂvs not yet

This contest will be a. continuation
of the series of political "fixes" instir
tilted by Mr, Edwin G. Merrill some
time ago for the purpose of stimulat.
ing a lively interest in the political
and governmental aflairs of the na—
tion, This year the argument prom—
ises to be especially hot as Chresto
hopes to dislodge Forum from its posi—
tion of debate champion among the
men’s literary societies on the Grin-
nell campus.

Additional interest is created by the
fact that the debate will take place at
an opportune time, the evening before
the election itself, when political 'lér-
vor will be at its highest pitch and
people all over the country will be
anxiously awaiting the counting of the
polls on the following night which will
decide this nation's leader for the next
four years.

First Lecturer t0 (Ir '0 Glimpses Into
Newspaper Field From Business
Mltn’s Point of View.

Paul Harvey, eminent American
journalist. will open the year’s lecture
course at Herrick chapel Friday eve-
ning. when he speaks on "The New
Journalism."

Mr. Harvey is being brought here
through the efforts of Prof. Charles
Payne who was impressed by his
forcefulness at the Williamstowu ll'
stitute of Politics, of which boll. were
members the past summer.

According to Mr. Payne, Harwey is
particularly well suited to discuss
rournalism. Besides an intimate knowi»
edge of newspaper work, be also poss-
esscs the business man's viewpoint.
Before entering the journalistic field,
Mr. Harvey was connected with a well
known brokerage firm in Boston. Mr.
Harvey was one of the three directors
of the Christian Science Monitor for
many years and contributed a great
deal toward making it one of the
greatest international newspapers of
the world. He and Mr.'Dixon, another
director of the Christian Science Mun-
itor, two years ago founded the Inter-
nutlonei Interpreter of which. upon
Dixon’s death, Harvey became editor,
The International Interpreter, aimed
to present foreign affairs in an im-
partial light, was, until its recent ab-
sorption by The Outlook, a power in
international affairs.

Pin—pole is Elitmm‘on

In order to establish closer contacts
with people, Harvey has deserted
journalism for the lecture platform.
His aim, Prof. payne says, is adult
education. He purposes to lift his
hearers above their narrow provin-
cialism, to widen the boundaries of

A new campus organization. unof-
ficially known as ‘The Writers Club"
was formed last Thursday evening by
a group of faculty members who are
interested in various forms of literary
production. Thc club will meet ir»

carry on a thorough study of the liter-
ary market.

Mrs. A. c. Kemble, Mr. and Mrs. H.

“Yen, Dibble!" song out a. hundred

no further. Dibble was rampaging

Professor M. J. Bradshaw, chairman

that certain faculty members. who are
particularly interested in the success
of the campaign, have volunteered to
give the last hundred of the three
