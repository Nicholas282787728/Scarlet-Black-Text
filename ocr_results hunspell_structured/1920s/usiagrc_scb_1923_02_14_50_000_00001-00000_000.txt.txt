,INTEILIGENGE TESTS

Grades and Test Scores are Genre.
' lated to Determine the
Accuracy of Tests.

TESTS MORE ACCURATE IN
‘ TESTING LOW INTELLECTS

France is still meeting with a great
undercurrent of resistance in her occu-
pation of the Ruhr. Altba the Ger-
mans have not Openly attacked the
invaders, except. at isolated paints,
acute observers of European affairs
agree that the attitude of the German
people in the occupied regions is be-
coming more and more threatening.

Resistance To French Occupation

Of The Ruhr Is Increasing DailyI

gWomen in Outside Activities Are
Found to Have Higher Grades
Then the Active Men.

Stuustlcs have recently been coins
pl‘led in Grinnell will throw some
light on the controversy as to whether‘
or not those who take part in many
outside activities receive high grades,
or not, Thcse ﬁgures are based upon;
the grades received in the Thurstene
and Tennan intelligence tests.

The grades of the eight Senior Wo-
men most active in college organiza.
tions were studied and it was found{
that the grades at three of them placed
them among the ﬁve highest for whomI
we have intelligence test scores. We
have scores for eighty-three Seniors.
Four of the Women ranked from six-
teenth to the thirty-ninth place in the.
entire' class. The eighth woman has
taken so much music that her score.
could not be taken with the others.

The dgures were also taken (or the
ten Senior men most active in outside
ucllvlllss and it was found that of the
ten one ranked elghth in college grades,
two under twentieth place, three under
fortieth, three under sixteenth and one
savoury—fourth. \

A correlauon was also made purely
on a basis or the intelligence with no
regard for college grades. This cor.
relation was to determine how the

'members of the present Senior class
ranked in their intelligence tests and
in the outside activities they haveI
been engaged in, The dlflerent activ-
ities were rated according to their im—
parlance and the\ amount of time that
the student had been engaged in :th
activity. The percentage of correla-
tion for the men was found to be con-
siderably higher than for the women
thus showing that the intelligence
tests seem to he a more accurate test
for men than for women in predicting
this type of success. This study also‘
revealed the Interesting fact that there
are only four men in the Senior class
who have taken pm in no culside ac-
tivity While in school.

In a study of the grades of those,
of the class of 1923 who have been in‘
Grinnell for three years it was found
thht the ten highest of the clghly4hrcc
who have taken the tests ranged from,
the second to the thirty-eighth place
in the intelligence test.

A good many of the 1923 class drop-
ped out of school at the end of their,
Freshman or Sophomore year and a,
study at their grades while here and‘
thelr score in the intelligence tests,
reveals 9. low average in both and a.
high percentage of correlation between‘
the two. This indicates that the in~‘
telligence test: is fairly accurate in
ascertalnlng the ability of students,

Further testimony to the accuracy,
of the tests is shown in a. study o! the
class of 1925. Their Freshman mes
were correlated with the Scores in the‘
Intelligence tests given early in the
fall or their drsc year and. a high par.
conesgc was found here. Amongsr
the twelve in the class who received
the highest grades the percentage at
correlation was .85 which is very high.

These correlations were made by the
class in Psychological Research under
Professor Hanson for the purpose of
determining how accurate these tests
are. The conclusions to be drawn
from the material found in the inves-
tigation are: (1) That the tests are
much more accurate in testing low in-
telligences thnn ln higher. but are I
fair test of future scholastic ability
in all cases: (2) That although lhcrc
are a, few outstanding exceptions the
re—te‘sts glvc approximately the some
results as the ﬁrst tests: (3) That
there is a closer correlation between
prominence in outside activities end
intelllgence scores among the men
than women. However, the women
most active in outside activities haw
higher grades than the men who are
most active.

against Langdn Hall and Smith Hall

respectively. Langan Hall and Buildv
ing Four are tied (or second position
and Smith Hall and Dibble Hall are
running neck and neck for last bon-
ors.

The ﬁrst contest of the afternoon
between Dibble Hall and building 4,
was the closest and most exciting. for
the teams were almost evenly match-
ed. Parsons was the cllcnsivs star
for Building Four, totaling eight
points for his team. Jansssn was are
best bet for the Dibble team because
of his guarding and his all around bas—
ketball abilily. The .ﬁnal score of
game was 11 to 10 in favor of Four.
Dibble Hall won its first game of the

series when it defeated Building Four

‘In the second game, with Langan Hall

second contest was much closer. The

Clark l-lall maintained a clean slate
by easily defeating Smith Hall in both
games, Smith Hall was unable to
score a single point in either contest.
Carl and Moyler worked well for the
Clark team in the first game which
was won by the score of 14 to 0.
The second game was a farce. It
seemed to result in a match among
the Clark men to see who could gar-
ner the most goals. Every roan on

of its most signiﬁcant moves was to
dock President Harding’s ship subsidy
measure in order to give ﬁrst consld<

Passage of the inner measure is con-
sidered to be imminent.

Senator McCunnick’s proposedcblld

probably never see the light of day

blocked by delay in the Judiciary sub-

constitutional amendment to advance

This amendment, if adopted, will set

Central Building

Conlrsl Building is now the proud
Dussesscr of a Club Room for its very
private and exclusive use, it is quite
worth noting that this is lhs only par—

situated in the heart of the second

For the ﬁrst time in the history of

certain: Centralites are making migh-
