Scarlet and Black (lagers Appear
In Good Condition for the
Season’s First Trip.

VVih two weeks of hard preparation
behind then]. the Pioneers are in good
shape to undertake their first rocd
trip of the season this week end. They
will tztclfle Missouri at Columhir , Fri-
day night, and Washington at St.
Louis, Saturday. two of the hardest
games on the Grinnell schedule.

The ”Shaw Me" cagers seem to
have hit their stride since their defeat
by Grinnell early in the season, easily
taking the Ames quintet into camp
Monday, 34 to 16. Playing on their own
court will give them an advantage, but
it will be a hotly contested battle for
both teams,

Pillars um Going Strong

The Pikers have continued their
Winning streak, and are yet undefeat-
ed, tied for the Valley lead with Kan-
sas. The dope is against Grinnell, but
the Pioneers are anions to avenge the
narrow defeat handed them by Wash-
ington, January 4, and will do their
utmost to [lush the southern team
from the top.

Mentor MacEachron's proteges have

i been. undergoing stifl Workouts during
the last two weeks, including hard
Scrimmages with the second team and
props, passing and foul shooting prac-
ties. The entire team is in good con-
dition with the possible exception of
Captain Eenz, who is still bothered by
A bad foot, but was ablc to scrimmage
against the freshman team Saturday.
It is expected that he will be able to
appear in the lineup Friday. A sound
of eight or ten men will accompany
Coach MacEachrnn, and will leave for
Columbic Thursday night.

Life of Eons Past.

Millions of yccrs ago, when minutes
were measured by centuries, enormous
reptiles lived all over North America,
especially in the section which is now
known as the Rocky Mountain dis—
trict, There were great dinosaurs
rcnging from seventy to cigbty feet in
length, some of them vegetable feed-
ers, others flesh caters who preyed
upon and killcd their companions in
herculecn wcrfsre. There were great
mastodons and mammoth flying lite
crds with e sweep of twenty—two feet
from tip to ti . There were swims
ming creatures of tremenduulls build
that would have measured up in every
way to our own vogue conceptions of
“sea. serpents."

Those great prehistoric brute: will
be visualized for you by Arthur Stcrry
Coggcsbcll, director or education in
the Ccrncgic museum, when he speaks
in Herrick chapel Ssturdcy night in
a regular number on tho Lecture
course. ilr. Coggeshdll is c pronlinz
ent paleontologist, internationally
known for his distinct and vcllmble
contributions to scicncc in we study of
dinosaur life.

Through the aid of Major Herbert
M. Dawlcy and the Cipcmn Distribut—
ing corporation, Mr, chgcslicll shows
motion pictures of thcsc .mimcls ds
they lived six million years ago. The
pictures are made from rubber figures
and from thousands of individual pho<
tos, ccch showing a slightly diffcreut
position with the result tho. the fills
ishcd film prescnts an cpparcntly cc—
curate movie of A form of life which
has been extinct from this earth for
millions of years. Pictures of the
actual remains of these animals, dis-
covered by Mr. Coggcsbcll in his ex
peditions, are clso shown.

The story is intensely interesting
and is told in c mcnner which anyone
is bound to enjoy. It is an accurate
story told by at man who knows how
these ancient brutes lived, what they
did and oven hawthey diet], and staged
back in a time which appeals irres-
istably to the imaginction, the tale
cannot but command our attention he-
ccusc of is uniqucncss.

At Sundcy morning Prayers, Blanche
Wilson rcl'ielvcd a part of Dr. Eichcrd
Czlhot‘s book, “What Men Live By".
Dr. Cnllot has divided happy and
hcftltlly existence into four elements;
work, play, love, and worship.

“The cftll of the job is instinctive in
man," Says Dr. Cabot. Work dispcls
discouragement because it takes our

Convention Reports by Parsons,
Condrd, Bradshaw, R. Read,
Yang, and W. Read.

Representatives to the Student Vol—
unteel‘ Convention which wcs held at
Indianapolis during the Christmas hol-
idcys, reported on the work of his
meeting, at Chapel this morning.

Walter Redd introduced the speck-
ers. Elizabeth Canard generalized
the plans of the convention and told
of the original organization. “The
muin idea of each member,” she said,
“was Lhctt it wits his purpose, 3! God‘
would permit, for him to be a foreign
missionary."

The question of War as a. World
problem, wits the subject discussed by
Harold Parsons, who stated the (our.
methods of bringing about peace, as
laid down at the convention, namely,
preparedness, education, a league of

nations, and a complete pacification,

on all sides.

Mr. Huwkins Yang spoke on race
relations, saying that “no racial dis—
tinctions should ever be drawn, un-
less in co-DDel‘ation with the races
concerned. The Challenge that the
world sends out today is a. challenge
to our generation, a. Christian chal-
lenge or missionary work, both foreign
and at home."

The final speaker on the program,
Prof. M. J. Bradshaw, stated that “it
is ler more difficult to be a Christian
on “’ﬂll street than to do missionary
work in Chino."
