A handsomely t'ramed picture of 1
Harvey Adams, a very
member of the lawzt Band, has been
presented to the college library by Mr, 3
Edward E. Adams, of Des llloincs, a\
son of this pioneer. ll. will he hung in l
the reading room on the second door.

An interesting feature of this gilt is
the manner in which Founders Day
was brought to the attention of Mr.
Adams. Noticing a news story in the ‘
Scarlet and Black about the Day. he'
got into communication with the lib-
rary and found they had only a small
picture of Harvey Adams. The pic-
ture arrived in short order.
