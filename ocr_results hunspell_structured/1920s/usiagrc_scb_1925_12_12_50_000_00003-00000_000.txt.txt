COMMITTEE EXTE
ABSENTEES FROM

The committee for the Christmas
Formal wishes to extend its synn
pathy to thosc unfortunate mortals,
who will not be able to attend that
terpischorean occasion. WHY". Here
is one of the reasons, and there are
many more oi them, this is Just one.
And you will admit it is a real one.

The highest priced orchestra ever
hired for a Grinnell iormal will do
the syncopating. And you ask, “What
orchestra is it ,Well to begin there
are eight musicians in the group. The
leader plays a mean cor-net, and has
been on the Orpheum circuit with a
famous orchestra, he also toured the
East last summer with this same
band or players, winning a name for
himseli that is to he looked up too.
He isn’t so big, but brother he could
make music on a shoe horn.

Drummer starts With Rattle

Then there's the drummer. He
started liie making music with e. rat-
tle box and he hasn't stopped since.
Now the iellow that plays ‘ihe tr0m~
hone has to use two hands to hold his
horn and use his ioot tor the slide,
And the piano player, Well! you‘ve
heard oi Padrewiski? uh, he's good
too. While Eddie, the boy who picks
the banjo has to wear asbestos gloves
so the strings won't melt.

Then come the sax players and the
boys who finger the gob sticks. They
can make more notes than a U. s.
mint and just as good ones. Last
but not least comes the bass horn with
a boy on the small end oi it that
plays with the orchestra only because
Sousa never h’eardhim.

Orchestra is Popular

Now that's all there are in the or
chestra, and while a lot more could he
said about do one of them, tis best
we let you find out for yourselves for
Johnny Ambrose and his Iowans are
tropical, and we don't mean somehow.
Johnny is known all through the mid-
dle west/for his popular music and
this hand or syncopators is going to
play the music you’ve always read
about but never got the chance to
hear.

So, it's my advice that you grasp

someboi‘ly's [intent leathers. Now the
price is as low as usual, only one buck

tipping the door keeper when you

You heard is true.

Smith Entertains at
First Dance Tonight

Smilll hall will hold its iirst dance
oi the season tonight in Rand gymna-
sium at eight o‘clock. The house
committee has planned a variety oi
stunts and novelties tor the dancers.

The decorations in the gymnasium
nre unique. A false ceiling has been
constructed level with the running
track and the decorations are all or
green and white? A huge crest has
been hung atthe extreme cud ol' the
dance iloor and a lighting arrange-
ment has been fixed, so that alter»
nate parts of the crest will he illums

‘inated.

The house committee has been at
work getting everything in readiness
for tonight's dance. The results are
that the gylilllilsium is transformed
from its usually bare state to a large
club room that is very unique, in that
such an idea has never before been
carried out. Those who had charge
