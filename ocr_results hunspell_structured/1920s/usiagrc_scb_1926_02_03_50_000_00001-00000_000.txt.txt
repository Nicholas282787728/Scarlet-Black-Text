ters and laymen, opened its program

borne will give his final Gates Memor-
ial lecture at long chapel.

with his third lecture entitled "Jesus
and the Modern Mind.” He will speak

seven o'clock on “Jesus and Inter
national Relationships."

Rabbi Will Speak

Dr. C. E. Burton will speak at 10:50
o'clock tomorrow morning 0n ofthe
main addresses of the afternoon will
be given at two-thirty o'clock by Rab—
bi Mahnheimer of Des Moihes who
will speak on better understanding be-
tween Jews and Christians. He will
be ~followed an hour later by the Rt.
Rev. Harry s. Longley.

The conference was organized at
1 0 o’clock yesterday morning, at
which time President J. H. T. Main de-
livered an address of welcome. Dr. c.
E. Burton, secretary of the national
council followed with an address "The
Growing Chr tian.” Speakers onthe
afternoon program were Dr. Charles
E. McKinley and the Rev. G. B. Wild—
er.

Attend Debate

At five o'clock the ministers were
welcomed at an open house at the fac—
ulty club and at six o'clock were
guess at the Community Brotherhood
dinner at the Congregah‘onal church.
Following the dinner Mr, Frank J.
Harwood, moderator of the National
Council spoke on "The Obligations of
the Layman to the Church." The delee
gates of the conference were given
complimentary tickets to the women’s
debate last night between Yenn and
Grinnell.

"The church and college have both
failed in presenting the ethics of
Jesus and have thrown about his
teachings a metaphysical cloak which
defies penetration by practical
means,” said Dr. Osborne in his Opens
ing lecture yesterday morning. He
went on to say, "There is need of a
simple workingbasis, of knowledge of
the rule of the road of life, of a defin-
ite practice of His ethics."

Mall interdependent

He stated that man is interdepend-
ent and the keynote of his religion
can he found in a recognition of this
interdependence and in a willingness
to help others.

Dr. Osborne opened his lecture by
calling attention to the fa'ct that the
Hebrew race has produced no great
philosopher, no world conqueror, no
colonizer. nor great scientist, no artv
ist, but is supreme in the field of
prophecy. With Jesus standing sue
preme as the moral leader the He-
brews have made their contribution to

F religion. , , '

In accounting for the universal in-
fluence of Christ's teachings, Dr. Os-
borne stated that Jesus speaks with
the authority horn of experience with
the real God, of personality and in-
tegrity of character, of absolute
knowledge of truth. The meaning of
life lies in the development of man's
soul and the fundamental concept of
the Christian faith in the doctrine of
brotherly love. He stated that al—
though Jesus took care of His phy5v
ical body and recognized the beauty of
the material world. he also recognized
another world and insisted that at-
tention be given the soul.

Not Keeping race.

Dr. Burton in his address discussed
the broadening and growth of our
various concepts; how in the last ten
years the knowledge of thcnew Taste
ament has been vastly increased; how
the development along scientific lines
advanced by leaps and bounds from
the old idea of matter to the modern
principle of the electronic theory; how

tional conference this afternoon.

Youth wants no more of the bigoted

dogmatic institutions. "He sees

church. Professor Norris said that
yo lth saw the church today as “a vast

meaningless fragments or the gospel,

The youth of today sees through the

foibles of science and democracy, but,

in them he sees a vision for the fol

Both science and democracy are in

accomplished is to make the world
safe for stupidity." Youth has more

Jennings Bryan has stirred up. The

"it seems to me that the youth of

The Pioneer basketball squad will

have gone thus far without a Confer—

would be sweet for Grinnell as the
Farmers oozed out winners in their
game with the Black men on the local
court.

Team Lacks Punch

The Scarlet and Black Squad have
been undergoing some hard Scl‘lil‘k
mages and practice sessions and Steve
eral changes have been made in the
lineup. Coach Black has shifted and
l'eshifted his men in an effort to
strike a winning combination, It is
apparent that Grihhell has the nucleus
for a team that ought to be showing
up better in the Valley race. Against
the Aggies and Oklahoma U. the team
displayed plenty of power at times but
seems to be lacking in the final
punch. In the last two giulles against
Nebraska. and Kansas, the Pioneers
took a slump and lost by wide marge
ins.

The Aggies have not played any
Valley games since their last encouhtr
ei' with Gl‘inuell but have played two
practice tilts with the Oklahoma Billie
tists, winning both handily. The
ilaulbctschnicn are still in the race
for the Valley honors as they lost only
one game, winning from Washington,
Gl‘innell, and Drake twice. The Aggies
possess some crack hoopsters and emc
ploy one of the smoothest passing zit-
tuclis of any team in the Valley. Coh-
nors, one of the star Aggics guards,
has played his last Conference game
and 'his absence will undoubtedly
weaken the Oklahoma aggregation.
Connors played a great game against
the Pioneers.

To Take Eight Men

Coach Black will take eight men to
battle the southerners. Because of
the changes in the lineup, the exact
eight is unknown but they will be
selected from the following: Captain
Wing, Peterson, Mark, Moran, Dav-ls.
Dol‘flhg, Nihlo, Hayes, Lamb, Chase,
and Sealand. With a revamped team,
Pioneer supporters are hopeful that
the Grinneii cagers will show a re-
versal of form and start chalking up a
few victories.

EHINNEIL NEEIS PENN
ﬂﬂ-ENENULAIFNNM

Morrison, Hayes and litm‘ley Repre-
sent Grilulell Against Pclut Before
Largo Sized Audience.

The first women’s debate of the
season, against Penn college in the
A. R. H. auditorium last evening, was
well attended. Janice Morrison, Vir-
ginia Hayes and Martha Hawlcy up-
held the affirmative of the proposi-
tion, “ Resolved, that an amendment
he added to the constitution to give
Congress the power to regulate child
labor," against a negative team com-
posed of Leone Faulkner, Mary
Louise Moniuger and Vera Johnson
from the Oshaionsa school.

An element of surprise entered into
the occasion when the girls at the
dinner thble at the quadrangle found
out, just before the debate, that they
were all on the same side, because
Gi'ilmell's negative team, Leone Wilk-
inson, Mary Cox and kuhie Burton,
had planned to debate the visitors.
Since Perm had sent a. negative team.
Gl‘lunell’s affirmative proved itself
equal to the occasion and went on the
platform twenty-four hours earlier
than they had planned, for the return
debate with Penn scheduled for ice
night.

Nantes Central Points.

Janice Morrison opened the case
for the affirmative. After a brief ac-
count of the history of the case, she
showed that the evening’s discussion
must center around two points: first,
is there a. need for further regulation
of child labor, and, second, whether-
this regulation can he most effective
ly done by the Federal government.
She pointed out the 'need fur Federal
regulation, by showing the conditions
in the various states. by pointing out
how state laws cannot be enforced.
and by pointing out how child labor
was detrimental,

Leone Faulkner opened the Penn
case by declaring that the situation
had been greatly over-exaggerated by
over-zealous reformers; that most of
the child laborers were employed on
their own home farms, and that many
of the rest. worked only part time. Her
parting shot was 1 request of the af-
firmative to show the Federal govern—
ment could better remedy the situa-
tion with the remaining few thousand
child laborers.

Explains Few Thousand”

Virginia. Hayes, continuing the CEISB
for Gl-llmell, pointed out that these

few thousand" who were engaged in
mechanical work amounted to 185,-
337. She then took up the evils in the
present system which had been point—
ed out in the Opening affirmative case,
and ShOWEd that Federal regulation
would remedy each Of them.

Mary Louise Moninger contended
that in the past the Federal govern—
ment had ane nothing for the situa—
tion, While the states, on the other
hand, had been very diligent; that
the minimum working age had been
increased, that schOOl attendance lZLWS
had been strengthened, and that night
labor had been generally abolished.

Problem Is National

Martha Hawlcy closed the atrium
itive’s case by pointing out that child
labor was a national problem. She

0n Appeal of Students and Faculty Trustees
Vote Down Cut; Tuition To Be Raised
For Next Year.

At a special meeting of the student
body and faculty which was held in
Herrick chapel this afternoon, Presi-
dent J. H. T. liain announced that
the board of trustees had favorably
considered and acted upon petitions
presented by both groups. He said
that there would be no reduction in
the teaching staff, and that tuition
would he raised to $250 a year, begin-
ning next fall.

The president opened his remarks
by saying that he had such profound
respect for Gl'lhnellians as men and
women, such warm affection for them
as partners with him in the greathus-
incss of living. that the more details
of life which must he discussed now
and then, sink out of sight. "it mak-

as my spirit is right; so long as the

Taylor Breaks
World’s Record

Pioneer llurlller Itnumng For l. A. C.
Tops High Hurdles For Record.

iiorgan Taylor, famous Pioneer
hurdlcr who graduated last week and
is now running under the colors of the
Illinois Athletic club, flashed his way
to an easy win and brokc the world's
record in the 70 yard high hurdles at
the I. A .C. indoor handicap track andl
field games at Chicago Friday night.

The new record set by the blonde
runner is :os 35, one fifth of a sec-
ond faster than the previous mark
held by Waldo Allies of the c. A. A.
The new record was unnoticed by the
officials at the games Friday night,
but in checking up, the new record
was substantiated.

The meet was Taylor's first taste of
competition this yetu' and the result is
surprising in as much as he is at his
best in the longer distances. If he
improves as much in the longer
events as he has in the shorter dis-
tances, he will smash several more
records before the summer is over.

The Olympic star now holds thrce
world's records: the 70 yard high hurc
dies (five flights) at :08 3-5; the 440
yard hurdles at :53 475; the 400 meter
hurdles (Olympic three-foot barriers)
at 52 375.

New VerSlon of Dance
At Colonial Tonight

Tonight, the Grinnell theatre goers
will have the opportunity to see a new
and different version of the Charles-
tuh. A program of dou'bles in
Charleston dancing has been arranged
and will be given at the Colonial the—
ater. Manager Jack Stewart has be-
cured for this entertainment, five
couples, who are college men and wo-
men to dance the double Charleston.

For the benefit of the imagination of
the audience the dancers will be
masked. Rumor has it that some
girls who are thinking no man can
be found who can keep up with them,
have entered the contest under 9.57
shined names and without the special
permission. Protected only by masks
from the curious Eyes of the audience
they will till a new and sensational
version of this popular terpsichoie.

As an added incentive other than
the title of Charleston Champions,
Manager West had offered ﬁfty dollasr
in prizes to the winners of the contest.
These winners will be judged bath by
the audience and judges.

Blairsburg Sketches
Bring $5,000 Law Suit

A suit for $5,000 has been ﬁled
against Marguerite Merrymzln, ’25, and
Joseph Wallcser, professor of English
last year, by Mrs. Cable or Blairsburg,
on the grounds that her character was
dclamed by the Blair-shorg sketches
which appeared last winter in the
JlmtO. The trial which was to have
been held in iVebsLel‘ City this month
has been postponed until the April

place where that is so true as at a.
college.

Happy To rreseut Yet. on

He continued that he was happy to
present the petition which approxi—
mately 90 per cent of the strident body
had signed, urging the trustees to rec
taiu those professors who services to
Grinnell have been long and honor-
able. "I believe in the right of peti»
tion and especially 1 am glad to stand,
for it in our college family, our unity
ol purpose here converges to a calm
mon end in the years to come. our
harmony of purpose here gives pow-
erful driving force toward some suc-
cessful purpose in the world. This
unity here converges to that unity
there. We shall always be one fam-
ily however far we gc. This family
spirit gives me a great joy'today and
I am glad when i think of your peti—
tion. because is symbolizes fellowship
itruthifad'th, in our common bond."

“Standing vely much alone, as I
sometimes stand, out in the Open
reaching for better things for you, I
hunger for consciousness of fellow-
ship. Through the medium or this pe—
tition we find ourselves one in pur—
pose and action." The president said
that the same was true of the faculty's
petition, and he remarked that "it is
something of immense value to us
who live together, to the college to
which we have'eutrusted ourselves
and our future.”

Students Will .

“What you students have asked for,
you have won; what the faculty asked
for, it has won."

The board of trustees made the ad—
justments necessary in order to meet
in detail the views expressed in the
two petitions, and at the same time
they maintained the spirit and the
fact of a balanced budget» “I am
happy," said President ’Main, “in the
thought that life is worth living
again." The gossip. misinterpretation
and misunderstanding which has been
broadcast over the country must be
endured and forgotten. “Grinneil
must be strong; Griunell must grow in
strength; Grinneli must be just; Grin—
nell must keep its teaching staff in»
tact and must strengthen it; Grinnell
must never lag behind; Grinnell must
set the pace. Grinnell will. Grinneil
must keep its student body intact;
Grinncll must challenge you to loyal-
ty, to devotion and to achievement;
Griunell must win you. Grinnell will.”

Tuition Raised At Other Colleges

Taking up the question of tuition,
he explained that (humans increase
of $50 per year would merely be in
line with a countrywide movement.
During recent months Chicago univer—
sity has raised its fees to sail a quar-
ter, Dartmouth to $400 a year, and
Yale, Harvard and many other institu-
tions have done likewise. Amherst,
with an endowment of 57,000,000 H
the largest possessed by any college
in Americaihas recently increased its
instructional charge to $300 a year,
not because Amherst needs the man»
ey, but because what it offers is worth
more than it has been receiving. All
the other schools in the Harvard ex-
change circle, including Pomona.
Knox, Carleton and Beloit, have had
higher tuition rates than Grinnell, but
despite this fact President Main has
been reluctant to thing of such action
actual operating expenses; the gap
here. No tuition would take care of
between cost and receipts must be
bridged by added endowment. to meet
high costs growing higher.

“I don't want a single Grimell stu-
dent to leave Grinneli because this
necessary increase may work a hard-
ship on you,“ Dr. Main reiterated.
He asked the senior class. in par-
ticular, to do its utmost to maintain
the high regard in which this insti~
tution is held, and during the few
remaining months of the school year
to aid in steadyius student morale.
“Give us a chance to know you, to
sympathize with you, to help you—and
help us. We shall meet you more
than halfewily. for are we not one,
working together?”
