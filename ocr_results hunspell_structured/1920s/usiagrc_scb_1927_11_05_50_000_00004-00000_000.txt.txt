1. Student speakers (men) will be
sent to institutions of higher
learning selected by the Executive
Council or Grinnell Forensic.
.Such speakers shall address the
college communities which they
visit, discussing topics about
which they are qualified to speak
and in which there is a student
interest; they will confer with
smaller groups and with individ-
uals; they will obsewe conditions
of student life.

.Reciprucal agreements will he

sibie oi the institutions to which
representatives are sent, such vis-
iting speakers being given an op-
portunity to address the assembled
members of Crinneli college.

.Grinnell representatives, after
their return to the campus, may:

1:. Method of selecting speakers.

1. The chairman of the department
or speech, the chairman of the de-
partment of English. the alumni
secretary, and two others from the
faculty to he chosen by the three
specified, will be invited to devise
a. plan for selecting speakers in‘
Accordance with the spirit or the

Project.

2. Such n plan, after its approval by
the facility, will he put into operr
ation by the Executive Council of
Grinueli Forensic.

. it is proposed that only colleges or
nationnl reputation be considered in
the selection OE schools to which
speakers will be sent, A tentative list
of silch schools might be Carleton,
Colorado college, Oberlin, DePaw, Bel-
oit, Washington university, Coe, Dene
nison, Knox and others or this type.

In the selection of the speakers the
mall's familiarity with the subject to
be studied will he considered together
with his speaking ability. This will
broaden the heretofore narrow field
to embrace the ciltil‘e male
body of the colloge.

'It has been felt [or sometime that
the prcscnt system of debating did not
meet with popular approval. With
the exception of the feature debates
with a foreign institution, student in-
terest has been lacking. To remedy
this situation, Grinnell adopted a pre-
Sulnably more popular style of de-
bating, without much improvement be

Grihneil Forensic feels that the
present system has not met the mod
ern demands for it was devised in the
middle ages for a society radically (life
ferenl: from our own. Grnncll, as a
college of liberal arts, is dedicated to
the principle ol preparing its students
for life, rather than for a specific pur-
suit, and yet. it supports debating, an
activity primarily useful to prospect-
ive lawyers.

tion from the semester fee fund will
not allow adequate funds for a proper
debating program. Approximately
5430 were available last year for dc-
batihg purposes; this amount was for
carrying on a men's Varsity squad,
women's varsity squad and a freshman
sound.

It is thought that the proposed sys-
tem can liecarried on with available
funds in a more satisfactory way with
more benefit to the individual and
to the college.

In addi on to other advantages the
proposed system will attract a larger
number ot men with more diverse in-
terests, thereby stimulating interest in
forensics.

proposal is composed of Robert Burr

also make those bothersome

not able to do ourselves. Their
service is very reasonable
and most pleasing.
