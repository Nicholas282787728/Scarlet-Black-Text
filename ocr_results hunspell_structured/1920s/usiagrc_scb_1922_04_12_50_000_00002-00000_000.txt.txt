THE “Y” CONFERENCE
The latter part or this week will see
some titty men ironr all the other col-
leges and universities of the state as—
sembled here for their annual Y. M. C.
A. conierence. Following the proce-
dent established during the high school
Press Convention, the visitors will be
housed in the dormitories and will be
guests of the college tor three days.
As before, every effort should be made
to see that these men are greeted
cordially, treated courteously, and
made welcome in every way possible.
The impressions oi Grinnell carried
away by the delegates will be based
on their reception here—and every-
man's duty'is or his guests.

,, Even if the Men’s Glee Club didn’t
take much or a trip, it's a safe bet
that the college and a few individuals
are better known as a result or the
iiasco, despite the doubtful value oi
the advertising. The only questionrer
maiuing to he settled is, was it intel's
ventien or interference?

These questions are merely of-

the things in which the public is
interested. We want our corres-
pondents to present frankly and
freely their views on what seems
to them the most important ath-
letic problem of the hour.

of sufficient importance to merit dis!

reading public. how much more sis-

It isn’t the faculty attitude that zit—

ment of a. prize contest sponsored by

In the information accompanying
the announcement, the contest editor
declares that "it doesn't matter so
much what college faculties think
about athletics. It is what the under-A
graduate thinks that is really vital.
There are a. lot of questions which
we would like to ask the undergrauc

“mat is the place 01 athletics
in education? what constitutes
the amateur spiritt It is worth
preserving? Is it endangered by
