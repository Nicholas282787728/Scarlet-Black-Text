AIN’T I-III DUMB 7

Accosted in the vestibule of a small town library, a
trim little woman was iound carrying an armload ot'
the latest novels and travel books. As the uneducated
wire of z, truck driver, she excited the curiosity or a

college woman who met her therc, and a.

"IV just this n y," tho lad) replied, “my husbiind

up on all this literatill-O, do I want him to be saying
’ltllllltl. ‘Aint shc lllllillll'"

Whether or not the girls or Grinncll college - c in
the mar nae market, with respect to two important
ilcltls or lmowlctlgc they may well ash thcmsolres. “Am
i dumb?" What does the average Grinucll girl lmow
or international relations" How oitcn do Grinneli women

Since hc (or in this so, she) who laughs last may
guiran loudest, Griiiiicll women might be iiitel'e’ted to
anon that the men are strangely ignorant a '0 in two
important divrs ons or knonlcdgc, Johnny Grinnclliaii
may well ask liiiuscli nith respcct to art and music:
“An 1 Too, Dniii .

The average male student hides behind one at two
deiense mechanisms when art or music is mentioned,
"They’re (or women,” he'll say, or, “I don't know any~
thing at all about music and art; all I know is what
tickles lily [aiich’ C, L

PROUD OF “IIAT WE DON’T KNOW!

The root or this wholc problem lies in the mental
attitude so many students have assumed, "I don't know
anything about it, and I'm proud of the fact,” How
often have you heard the expression, “1 nevcr could get
hold or that piece oi knol\ledge~why, ever since I was
a kid, etc,"

Obviously, the fault lies with the attitude or the
student himseli. As participants in a liberal arts cduczt~
tion at Grinnell, it is the business or each one at us to
ﬁnd out something about those fields of learning which
we have walled up in our minds alid labelled taboo.

Nor is this editorial a statement of vague generalitie ,
Two deﬁnite charges are being made against the women
and two allegations dgnillst the men at Grinnell college,
Whoever you are, reader, the boot fits you. Take heed.

IARLI 'ON RAISES TUITION.

lt' any further justiﬁcation of the advance in tuition
at Grinncll college is needed, the example of Carleton
college, an institution similar to Griiinell at Northﬁeld.
)Ill‘mu may be cited. President D. J, Cowling has just
announced an increase in tuition to $300 a year, $50
greater than the sum charged at Grinnell.

in announcing the change, Dr. Cowling stated the
increase was necessary it the high standards in class-
room instruction were to be maintained. Just as at
Grinucll. even with the advance in tuition the Carleton
student is paying only a percentage of the actual salaries
or tutors and professors and of the cost of instruction.

The story runs as follows: "The
case or James McKeag is perhaps uni-

The president and one or the found-
ers of the new Big Ten Country Club,
who is now a practising lawyer in
Chicago . was one oi the greatest has.

game at the Univer. y ot Chicago, but
through a combination or circum-
stances he never won the varsity "C".

McKeag was at Grinnoll college in

a basketball star and played tackle
in football for two years, He gradu-
ated in 15102 and entered the Univer-

There was no one year residence
