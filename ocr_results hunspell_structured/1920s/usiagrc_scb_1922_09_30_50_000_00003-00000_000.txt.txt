“Outrage" is Keynote in Final

Talk to Men of Grinnell;
Gross Next Speaker.

Dr. Steiner closed his series 01’ Ml-
dresses at the Y. M. C. A. Thursday
evening, witih a powerful appeal for
high ideals and courage to stand out
against the currents of life which
sweep away the good and build up
the wrong.

“Part or the process of living,” he
said, “consists in casting oil old or
unfit customs and cresds, and ac-
cepting new convictions and beliefs;
but before relinquishing the old, we
should \opcn—minriedly and courage-

_ously‘aucstion the new. It takes
jcoui-agc to asl: questions in thc right
1 -ay but we must. Criticism is not
lnecessary sophistication, and holiest
‘doubt is iniinitely better than luke-
warm assent.

“We've come to a dead level or the

campus," declared the speaker,
“Christianity is dead on our hands.
and we're not courageous enough to
facc the matter and the problems."
What we need is will power and
courage to probe the depths of our
doubts and lormulatc ileals and con—
victions of life. Unless we use our
present opportunity to develop the
spiritual side or our lives, when we
,necd it it will be gone.
,l "The time will come," said Dr.
steincr, "when nothing but faith will
help usidon't throw faith away."
.Better he in error and hold our mm
in tenacity than to have no faith at
all. “Test everything before throwa
ing it away,“l he said, "and hang onto
faith and idealism, tor bankruptcy in
ispiritual life is always proceeded by
.bankruptcv in ideals. There is no
courage so great as that required to
hold onto ideals, hut ’Lis then that we
know that we are sons of God."

The Association building was filled
toi- this address, which was one or the
best of the series. it is hoped that
an even greater number of men may
avail themselves or the opportunity
of hesring Rev. Cross at next Thurs»
day night’s meeting.

RUUDOLPH VALE) 1N0 HAS 0th
PET I’EEVE

Although Rudolph Valentino, thc
handsome young actor who is our
pcaring with Mac Murry in her
starring vehicle “The Deli ous Littlc
Devil" at thc Colonial Theatre, was
born in Tarauto, he scldom displays
that ﬁery temper which is accepted
as charactcristic of the Italian race.
But thcrc is one sure way to rouse
his no, and that is by spe‘llug his
lost name Rudolph instead of
Rodolph. Valentino is the son of a
captain in thc italiau Army. and he
was himsell attached to the italian
Flying corps, conducting ‘cxperioicnts
in harazardous air stunts at Mineola
and he naturally dislikes the Tour
tonic spelling of his given name.

Valentino began his public career
as an automobile racer in imy, win~
iling second honors in a race be-
tween Naples and Rome in 1903, at
the age of sixteen. His first stage
appearance in America was as
dancer in New York, and for two
years he toured the country as Joan
Sawyer's dancing partner. He sang
and danced in musical comedy for a
season, and rounded out his stage
career by a year with the Alcazar
stock Company in San Francisco.

Universal gave him his ﬁrst op-
portunity in pictures. As the lovcn
of Mae Murray in this picture he has

“BE OPEN MINDED”
SAYS REV. CROSS

Urges Students to Be Guided by
Their Convictions.

“We’re in college to come ‘9 grips
with reality," said Rév. Cross oi the
Congregational church, at chapel
Thursday morning, “therefore we
should conic with open minds, expect-
ing many of our opinions to be modi-
ﬁcd or expanding." Upon graduating,
our convictions should be more ﬁrmly
grounded than upon coming to College.

The end of education is to provide
a man with clear, strong convictions
for which he Will live and ﬁght and
die, if need be, declared the speaker.
A college graduate should be, tbel'er
fore, it man oi creed, his life guided
by deep and ﬁrmly rooted convictions.

"Truth," said Ray. Cross, "is not
dispassionatc. it lays hold on our
pulses, and makes us passionate and
invent.“ He cited as an example
Theodore Roosevelt. who, though not
always right, was a man ot moral inc
tegrity and a passionate supporter of
his convictions; and stressed the fact
that in following high principles of
living no amount of! criticism should
down us. ’

AT THE COLONIAL
Charles Ray, in “Nineteen and
Colonial Theatre next week, opening
an engagement of two days on Tues-
day. In this most recent production
Ray makes something or a departure
from his customary "l'ubc" role, this
time apeparing in the part or a small-
town dandy wearing up»to-thc-lulnute
mail order house rainmont. The pro-
ductiou is perhaps the most fitting
described as a comedy of youth, tor
in it nay appears as a nineteen-
yeal'»cld lad and opposite him in the
leading feminine role is demure
Clara Horton, who is her-sell: only
sixteen years old. The photo-play is
replete with amusing situations and
one of these, strangely enough, has
to do with Mr. Ray’s capture of a
burglar. Prominent in the cast with
Mr. Ray and Miss Horton are George
Nichols, Cora Drew, Frank Norcross,
Lincoln stedman and DeWitt C. Jen-

How Parker Pails put Capillary
Attraction to actual use

IF EVER an instructor asks you to name a practical use of
the scientiﬁc principle of capillary attractionijust Cite the
Parker Pen with its leakproof “Lucky Curve" iced.

All fountain pen makers were carded for years by the sc-
called "sweaung" of pens. inked ﬁngers still Cause many
complaints except from those who use Parker Pens.

For Geo. s. Parker solved the problem by inventing the
“Lucky Curve” illustrated above. it forms a contact with the
wall of the ink harrel~and no matter how much ink sur.
rounds it the capillary attraction regulates the ﬂow—it is
steady; even and positive at all times.

This is one of the cardinal reasons that the Parker Pen is in
such high favor with educators and student bodies. A pen
that’s a helpinot a distraction—when one is concentrating

the mind on study or instruction.
