Football signals were not always as
complicated as they are now. A Pur-
due alumnus states that in the early
’90‘s his football team had only three
signals. Two fingers extended on the
right hand meant that the right halts
back was to carry the ball, the same
signal an the left hand meant that the
left half was to do the work, while one
finger straight down indicated the
fullback.

For this he was

sent to prison

Roger Bacon may not have invented gun-
powder, as has been claimed by some biog-
raphers of the famous Franciscan friar, but
he exploded some of the outstanding errors
of thirteenth century thought. Because of
his advanced teachings, Bacon spent many
years of his life in prison.

In an age of abstract speculation he boldly
asserted the mathematical basis of all the
sciences. But even mathematical calcula-
tion, he showed, must be veriﬁed by ex-
periment, which discovers truths that spec-
ulation could never reach.

In the Research Laboratories of the Gen-
eral Electric Company, Bacon’s principles
are followed in every experimental investi-
gation. The gas-ﬁlled electric lamp and
the electron tube were worked ' out on
paper, but it was experimental veriﬁcation
of the underlying mathematical theory that
made electric illumination, radio broadcast—
ing and X-rays what they are today.
