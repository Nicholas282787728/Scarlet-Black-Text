THE rUTunh‘

It may seem pessimistic to con-
stantly harp upon chaotic conditions
in Europe today. and yet if American
college students do not face this sit-
uation fairly and squarely they will
not justify the time and money that
is being spent on their education.
The arLicle‘Europe at the Turn of the
Year," by Frank Simonds in the
January Review of Reviews is so
thoughtrslimtuating that is deserves
careful reading. Sirnbonds is recog
nized in the newspaper fraternity as
one of the few men who always knows
what he is writing about better than
any other man. '

He say ~ “It is idle to presume that

task that is holore them. Their time
will come soon, and thcy should he
