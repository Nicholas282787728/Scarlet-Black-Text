Playing on a muddy field. which, to
a degree, concealed the true merit of
both teams, Cornell and Grinnell ane
tied to a 3 to 3 tie at Mount Vernon
last Saturday. '

A hard rain which had falleir most
of the day continued to fall during
the first quarter ,thereby preventing
the least semblance of fast play. A
ﬁeld goal by Meetcr gave Grinnell
the points necessary to tie the Furple
gar-bed team. Greene put the Mount
Vernon aggregation in the lead with
a pretty drop‘kick from the twenlyr
yard line, after Lamp made the score
‘possible by blocking Moi-ans punt,
which Adaoison recovered

Linc smashes constituted the ill
the greater part of the first three pel—
iods. in the last period, however.
both teams were able tn open up with
more open play. Cornell had the
edge in fhe later department, by com»
pleting several snappy passes which
went for gains of from five to [lie
teen yards,

The Scarlet and Black line was a
Safe rampart against all of the
charges of Coach “Brick" Barker's
men. The Grinnell backs were able
to pierce the Cornell line for gains of
from three to twenty yards during all
four periods. Dining the first quar-
ter, H\ find's men were in a favorable
positron to score twice, but both
times, however, Grinnell passes were
knocked down behind the Cornell
goal, giving the Purple the ball on the
twenty yard line.

sir-cot Stars

Stotls opened the second period by
returning Dean's kick twentyefive
yards to Cornell's thirty-five yard
line. From here Gl'liinell tore through
the Cornell line for successive gains
of nine, one, seven, three. and four
yards on smiishes by Sweet and Wing.
0n the lifleenryarrl line Moran fumb—
led and Hooper recovered, staying off
what looked like a certain touch—
down, Captain Sweet was the hero
of this skirmish by running through
the highly touted Purple line for four
gains oivfrom three to nine yards. By
these dashes he showed the Pioneer
backers that a more turned ankle
will not prevent him from showing
the caliber of football that placed
him on the second "all—valley" eleven
last fall. His slashing cut—hacks were
the feature of this period of play,

' In the final two periods both teams
were trying hard to score. The play
became more open as Cornell and the
Pioneers both reverted to passes and
wider dashes at the wings. Two pass-
es, Dean to Crabtree, one for twenty
and the other for sixteen yards, but
Cornell deep in Grinneli territory.
Both times Grinnell stayed off the on—
slaught of the Methodists and kicked
the ball out of dangerous territory.

Hooter Ties score

However, just before the third per-
iod Lamp blocked the punt which
started Cornell on the way to their
field goal. About the middle of the
last period Meeter was sent in to re-
lieve sweet, He celebrated his en—
trance into the scrimmage immediate-
ly by tearing off several good dashes
which put the Scarlet in a position
from which he could kick the goal
that tied the score, It was a pretty
dropkick from the thirty-one yard
line. made all the more difficult by
the ball slipping from the center's
grasp and rolling along the ground to
him. His kick cleared the bar with
about twently feet to spare, the hall
also clearing the end-zone by yards.
Because of the bad pass there were
several Cornell men around him when
he booted it.

Few sill tutions Made

Ooach i-iyland confined his substi-
tutions to three men in the backfield
and one man in the line, All the men
showed up to a good advantage, Thc
Pioneer line regularly opened holes
through the touted Purple line
through which the Griniicll backs ran
for consistent gains during the first

INDEHMAN APPDINTED
ASSISTANT MANAGED

Millhiilser nines Helper For Busi-
ness Ma agor: Interest lSlHWlli in
Art Staff Tryouts.

Ethel ingerman, because of
work on the business staff of the
Malteaser last year and this fall, has
been appointed assistant business
manager for the coming year. other-
appointments to the business staff are
not yet announced, but will be short
1y.

The art staff remains the same un-
til after the first issue. The tryouts
for the art staff showed a high de-
gree of interest and the ouantity of
drawings handed to Miss Crook, the
art editor. indicates that there will be
several new names on the roster of
the art staff before long. The ranks
of the editorial staff remain unbroken
by any new comers. Ashton Carhurt.
Loren Reid, Dorr Yeager, and Roma.
Kaurh'nan are still holding their
places on the publication staff.

Tire state circulation of the Ma!-
teaser is greater this year, by a big
margin, than that of the college it
self. This is the reason for the
change of policy that the magazine is
under-going. The magazine will con—
tinue to be, as before, strictly a hurdle
ornus publication, but the appeal will
be directed toward a general public
rather than a particular one. This
change in appeal accounts for the one
largcments of the departments of
verse and reviews and is the reason
for the introduction of short stories
and the like into the pages of
hook.

The English department have ex»
pressed it willingness to co-nper e
in developing thc literary side of the

Yearling Football Team Ems First
String Three Times ln Week.

The freshmen football squad is
gradually rounding into shape and
aside from drill on fundamentals has
been pitted against the varsity three
time’s during the past week,

The line, from tackle to tackle, is
heavy and fairly fast, with such men
as Jordan, a 230 pound Southerland
lad, McDonald of Boone, and Vim
li‘ossen of Adel looming as probable
stars. Barnett, a. husky and promis-
ing Moulton youth, has been kept off
the field during the week because of
sickness. Robertson, of Emken Dow,
Nebraska, looks best among the ends,

The backfield, which houses a
galaxy of high school stars, promises
to give the varsity plenty to .worry
about. Coaches Duke and Board seein
seem to have found an effective com-
limation with Don Duke, Washington,
at quarter, Augustine, Orient, and
Pascoe, Eagle Grove, playing the
halves, and Parrott, Corydon, atluile
back. The latter hits the line like a
locomotive, and plays a strong de-
iciis 'e garnc.

Pi’chidiliit J. H. ’1', Main has been
appointed a member of a committee
of four iowa collcgc presidents which
will meet at Des lioiues Saturday to
discuss charges of commercialism in
intercollegiate athletics made last
spring by Dr Karl F. \l'cttstone, pres-

irlent oi Dubuqire university.

The meeting is called by Dr. D, w.

tee, and includes President Main,
Pr ent Sage of Goo college and
President Hillinan of Simpson cole
loge. As president Main will be out
of town this wcck end, Deair John S.
Nollen will represent him in the dis-
cussions to be held upon Dr, Wett-
stone's charges.

Dr. Wettstluic to Attend

Dr. Wettstone. who will be present
at the meeting, alleges that by means
of scouting. deslmble athletes are lure
ed from one school to another, leave
i g the smaller institutions at the
mercy of the larger and ,wcnlthier
institutions He also asserts that
the whole system of intercollegiate
athletics is fundamentally wrong;
that the emphasis upon star athletes
crowds out the great majority of stu—
dents who are entitled to the benefits
to be derived from the various sports.

As a remedy for the situation, Dr.

l'i'os. Foill‘

- Weitstone has proposed the following

program -

Emphaslze brain above brawn.

Regard professors as more than
mere incidents in the life of colleges
or universitr -.

Abandon scouting either through
athletic departments or aluinni asso—
ciaiions.

Prevail upon alumni associations to
stop interfering with college lttldlet»
ics.

Put salaries of coaches and athletic
directors on an equal basis with
those of the heads of other depart-
mellLs,

Visit severe punishment on any in»
. itution which directly or indirectly
hr aks faith with other colleges.

According to Dean Nollcn, any de
cision that may be reached by the
committee will depend upon lrow ,well
Dr. Wetsttoiie substantiates his
charges.

Dubuque university has already
withdrawn from intercollegiate ath-

News Hunters Swamp Campus When
Open Tryout Season Is Announced

The open season for Scarlet and

Not less than severityrfive of us

five living, throbbing, human beings,
the same as you. by the way, have
pledged all» that we are and all that
we hope to be to the task of covering
chapel and collecting back subscrip—
tions.

But that is not our whole task; iiot

are going to persue cvcry square
foot of this here campus iir search
for anything that will tickle the fan-
cies of the editorrlii-clilef. We have
invoked the Muses; we have consult-
ed the Oracle; and with their help
we shall unearth every ‘ecret on the
campus. Pitiless publicity/7min lots

So if in the next few

days some

young man gently knocks at your
door and asks you how many barrels

carian pancakes, do not think the
young fellow is entirely gone. Re-

young lady should timidly ask you for

you had any or not. For she was
probably editor of the Senior Annual,

The outcome ol the Minnesota uni—
Vei‘sitysGi'innell game, at Minneapolis
this Saturday, is hard to dope due to
the frequency with which Gopher
eievens have spilled the dope bucket
in recent years. The most noticeable
evaniple took place last year when
“Red" Grange and the Illinois team
were handed a 21-0 plastering at the
hands of the Minnesotans.

As Grinnell and innesota have met
no opponents in common yet this fall
the only conipniison of the strength
of the two eleveiis is paper discussion
of their prowess.

Gophers show Power

of North Dakota, last week, llﬂnnev
sota proved to have a. fleet as well
as alert backfield. Two of the Go~
pliers four touchdowns were the re—
sult of long runs after recovered fum-
bles. The remaining two touchdowns
resulted from consistent short range
dashes at the wings, mixed in with
several noteworthy whirls of dis—
distances greater than twenty yards.
Peplaw, speedy sprinter, was respo
sible for two of the touchdowns. His
generaishrp was one of the high
lights of the game. He featured with
several long runs deep into North Dar

varsrt- seemed to be a surprise to
the followers of the Gophers in the
Twinemlies, He celebrated his ad—
vance by backing up the line superbly
on defencc and proving a wonderful
interferer as well as a hard line

Crinnell will start their second con-
test with a Big “10 team in ten years
with, perhaps, the strongest lineup
that the Pioneer school has ever been
able to present. Grinnell features,
besides a very powerful line, a.
speedy bard plunging backfield. The
Scarlet has the weight of a team se—
lected from many men, and this beef
is handled with speed and the men
show a well developed sense of
rhythm in running interference.
