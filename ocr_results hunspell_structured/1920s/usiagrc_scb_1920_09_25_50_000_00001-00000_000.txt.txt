Snappy scrimmage was the order 01‘

Oracle Back In _
Gentle Hint On
Local Traditions

As a reminder of the interpre-
tation placed on the smoking rul .
by upper classmen last year, the
Oracle this morning i sued a dair—
nite set of regulations governing
smelting and dorirntory conduct
or college men. Members of the
organization state that these reg-
ulations will be enlorccd lo the
letter. The statement follows: .

1. There will he no smoking
on the campus, in any building
on the campris, or within one
block of the campus in any die
recticn.
2. There will be no smoking in
front of the president’s home.

Number one is interpreted to
mean that there shall he no smok~
lag between the south end of the
logia oi the men's . dormitories
and the Alumni Recitation Hall.

3. Training hours shall be o
served by all men in the dormie
torles, i. all buildings shall be
quiet atte ten o'clock each night
so that athletic men may get their
required sleep.

Where is the campus “getvl'lch-

Huff or, captain Reece, as the home
gone, and no one has reported reser—
vations in choice seats for chapel. And
besides that. to hear students talk,
you would think that everyone on The

It would seem that the college has
fallen away from the old tricks, and
that more clever “gags" were being
used by the money handlers than ever
before. Anyhow, the whole student
body, especially including the fresh~
men, who are the butts of all jokes,
is grutetul for the consideration of the
