Night football between Drake and
Grinnell had its beginning nearly
thirty years ago in 1900 and 1901
when the teams played two evening
games in the old Des Moines Western
league ball par .

Mark W, (Mike) Hyland. former
Grinnell football coach and [anions
Hawkeye back in 15109 and now a
lawyer in Taina, describes the second
of these two games as he witnessed it
through a knotholc in the fence way
back in 1301 when he was a boy_ of
twelve. ”I remember” he stated yes-
terday, “that i didn't have it very
good seat at that game. I was at a
knotholc in the fence of the old ball
park behind the auditorium and north
of the ‘Y’ building. The fence was so
close to the sidelines that whenever
the two teams lined up to kick off I
could talk to Evan S. Evans, now a
doctor in Grinneil, who was playing
right half back.

“As I remember
was exceptional.

it, the lighting
1 could see every»
thing that can be seen through a
kncthole. We kids all climbed up on
high poles along the sides to whioli
were attached wires holding up the
arc lights. As fast as we got up,
some burly policeman would order us
down. A hundred of us must hovc
been kicked down during the game.

Drake and Grinnell Played Two Night .
Games In 1900 and 1901 In Des Moines

“There was a big fracas at
same which I reiiiciubcr about
bust of anything, I think it was
Boyer, playing at left mckle for
Drake, who hit Lane, the referee, in
the nose and time was taken out for
a little scrap."

None of these fancy reflectors and
flood-lights of modern lighting were
a part of the equipment for this ear-
ly night battle. Nothing but ancient
arc lights protected by Cllicken-Wll‘e
netting. hanging from a big role in
the middle of the gridiron and other
polcs on the sidelines supplemented
the moon as light for these struggles.
Instead of the white “ghost ball” to
be used in the contest between Drake
and Grinneil in the Drake stadium
Saturday night, the common garden
variety of brown pigskin was kicked
over the field.

Results of the battles proved that
Pioneers and Bulldogs have about the
the saute quality of owleeyes in their
griddcrs. In 151ml Drake won 6 to 0
while the following year Grinncll
turned the tables with a (i to 5 tri-
umph. Mr. Hyland witnessed the sec-
ond battle as a boy of twelve.

According to Di-.,Evaus S. Evans,
who played in the second game and
whom irlyland carried as his ideal of
a college athlete for years because

AMES PASSING IS FUTILE

Grinnell Show? powerful Offense
Arid Invulnerable Defense
In Saturday‘s Game.

Launching a powerful offense and
determinedly breaking up the much
talked of passing combination of
Ames, the Grinnell football learn de-
feated Iowa State college 3 to [I in
the annual Homecoming celebration
Saturday afternoon. ,

Air tight ball, a boost from Dame
Fortune at an opportune time, a liar.
fense that was invuinerable, a pass
defense that allowed the cyclones two
completed passes out of nearly a doz-
en tries, and a fighting spirit were the
ingredients that the Pioneers used in
administering a stinging defeat to
Antes.

The same kind of a fight was made
by the Pioneers which Aines staged
against the famous Grinnell team of
two years ago. Then Grinnell com-
pleted long passes, uncorked three or
[our long runs and their failed to
score. This year Ames carried the
ball into Grinnell territory only to
lose the ball as a touchdown seemed
probable.

Ilillllliloom Surely Missed.

From the Start it was apparent
that the cyclones missed their Cap~
tain Lindblooni who injured his
shoulder a week ago. Under his lead.
ei-ship in the last three minutes of
play when he was substituted in the
iowa state backfield, Anies made one
last attempt to score. Three first
downs, and a pair of completed pass-
cs which nearly got a runner loose
were of no avail when Parish interr
cepted a pass and gave the ball to
Grinnell with only a few seconds left
to play.

It is seldom that a team plays as
perfect football from the standpoint
of handling the ball and receiving no
penalties as Grinnell used , in the
homecoming battle. Not a fumble, not
a punt which did not take the ball
well into the Ames territory ah’d only
two penalties were inflicted on the
Pioneers,

Apparently Grinnell was more in-
tent on keeping her three-point lead
than in piling up a score in the second
half. No passes were tried; hardly a
play which might call ror extra hand-
ling of the ball and an extra chance
to fumble was used; often McIntire
kicked on the third down.

For the first time this yea , Grin.
neil started a backfield of er—
ienced men. Mclntii-e was at quarter,
Macy and Licdtke were playing ball-
hacks and Rose played fullback. In
fact, it was the first time this year
when these four men have been in
shape at the same time. Rose and
Lictltke had seen little action before
becou of pulled muscles.
