Soph Coed (to Frosh Quaditc)
What! And you don’t know who Boh-
by De Long is? Bobby's the boy with
so much “It” that he calls it “Them."

Many of the old boys boast that they
can walk from the dorms to the quad
with their eyes shut. Judging by
What some of them meet when they
set there they must keep them shut.

Either that or they are like the
proverbial blind horse.

To which the quad might reply that
it's a horse of another color.

Jimmy Davis tells us that he calls
his girl back home Olive. She's no
good until she’s pickled.

Reminds us of our old girl We calls
ed Good Idea. She was always being
carried out. _.

It seems those little stall in the
sun parlor are for card playing after
all. One of the boys tells us that he
called for a showdown there the 0th ‘
er night and now he’s playing so
taire.

An old grad wandered into the var
sity after the Kansas game. His face
wore a lost and lonesome cxnresslo
He seemed to feel so out of place amid
the dancing youngsters. As his eye;
wandered over the crowd it lighted on
a. blond head. A tear of joy ran down
his cheek. '

"They may painkthe tower or chl—
cage hall, tbcy may’talre the obser-
vatory off Goodnow, they may change
football coaches, they may stop the
paddle parade, but." and a reminiscent
sigh shook his frame, “Bub Talbot!
goes on forever." And he went away,

_silently contented.
