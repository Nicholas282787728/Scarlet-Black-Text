I asked the instructor. lie was a snap
‘cial friend of mine. why his class
melted away so completely. He 6).-
plained that there were just certain
requirements there which must be
met. After a beginner could pass
those. be could not be made to come
to class any more.

Tl’iie Swimmer Loves Wilton

“This simply shows that swimming
taught in an overcrowded pool to a
group whose only aim is to pass a
certain test, does not develop a love

. ior the water which every true swim-
mer should have.

"our classes as a rule are small,
but they remain praétically as large
as they start the whole semester.
sometimes we even convert ilidivld~
'udls into water fans. i remember one
student who came to me at the first
171 the year and told me that the only
reason he was taking up swimming
for physical training requirements
was that he didn't have to buy any
clothes to go in swimming. Now he
comes over twice or three times as
much as he is required and is devel-
sapling into one of our best swimmers."

"The Origin of our Numerals" was
the subject of a talk by Clifford Com-
Stouk at the Mathematics club in

Mr. Comstock took up the history of, -

of the Hindu numerals that were car-
ried by traders into EurDrIe and are
the basis of our modern numerical
. 'stem. He discussed the advantages
of our present system over the old
