THE TOWN STUDENTS

Invitation was made through
the press by the men living in the
six dormitory buildings to nearly
se1enty men living ill town, to be-
come associate members of the,
dormitory buildings, and to feel,
free to come to the clublooms of“
each building and make them-
5911 cs one of the men of their hall.

This initiative on the part of the
dormitory men should go far
towards bringing about a feeling
of close relationship between the
men who live in the dorms and tlle
nlenliving' in private homes in
town. It has been found that a
certain feeling has arisen among
town students that they are not as
much a part of tlle college as arel
the dorlurites. Although entirely
wrong, it is easy to see how this
feeling can arise. It proves that

‘sell books to all of the students,

and more centering around the
men’s halls, as was the wish of
President Main. It is the natural
evolution.

However a folnlal evening of‘
introduction in the form of a
building snicker or informal get-
together should be hold in the near
future in each building, at which
time the newly invited town mem-
bers can be formally made incin-
bel‘s of the buildings. This will
serve to smooth over the slightly
strained relations between the two
units.

“'hcther or not the associate
members should be included in
house dues for the parties, etc, is
a matter for each building to take
up as it sees ﬁt.

G
THE “REC HOURS.”

The announcement of the ap-
poin‘inlcnt of the faculty social
committee has boosted the plans
for the starting of the weekly rec-
reational hours. The appointment
of two women by the IV. S. G. L.
board, two men by the men’s sen-
ate, and two faculty members by
the faculty social committee, to
serve on the recreational commit-
tee is all that remains to be done
before the popular “rec hours”
can be started. Judging from the
many inquiries that have come in
regarding the plans for the year
relative to recreational hours.
it would seem that the institution
has proved a great success.

A slight improvement over tllt‘
plan of last year might be made by
making out the program of the
affairs for the whole semester, or
year, at the beginning of the scar
son, thus avoiding the necessity of
calling the
every week to decide whether a
dance should be hcldvthat week

It was thought in some circles
on the campus that many oppor»
tunities to have social hours were
missed last year merely because
“it was too much trouble” to get
the “rec committee” together.
This may or may not be true, but
it might prove much easier to can-
eel the date for the recreational
hour, if necessary, than to call it
meeting every week to plan for it.
If we are not mistaken, the danc-
ing regulations, as revised last
year, make it permissable to hold
one recreational hour a Week

The early year enthusiasm of a
