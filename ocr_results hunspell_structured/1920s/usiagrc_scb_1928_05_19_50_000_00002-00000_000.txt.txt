OPPORTUNISTS.

Whatever may he said to the contrary, ‘either as a
matter of policy, or of self defense, there seems to he
liltle,(lollht that Americans as a. whole, and individually,
are opportunists. We speak in broad, general terms of
a phlosonhy which accounts for our mode of existence, or
of a, program definitive in nature which guides us in den
cisionsY but as a matter of fact these are always altered
and readjusted Whenever something new and appealing
arises. \Vitl'l but little regard for the future we choose
the course of action which appears best for the present.

American industrial life of the past quarter century at-
fords the best example of this. Few people realize just
how drastically things have changed recently. Scientific
discoveries have preceded new methods in industry, and

Maurice Crubb, '29
Room McDonald, ‘31

our captains of industry, much touted as conservative .

and narrow, have seized upon these new inventions with
much gusto. ’As a result of this continuous process of
innovation, based on cpportunism, America today travels
three hundred miles an hour, talks with Europe by radio
telephone, and is apparently about to place an engineer-
industrialisl in the Fresidentia‘l chair.

This same spirit which characterizes our‘zlllnost in—
comprehensible economic devclopment has permeated all
other phases of American life No one questions that our
foreign policy has been dictated by the adventurous spi»
rit oi chance, which is of the essence of opportuni in.
Likewise,
sacred and inviolable though its provisions may be, have
undergone constant change as times have demanded.
The attitude at the government and people to all social
questions has been dominated by the same nndannted
spirit. Companionate marriage. and allied devices, are
simply the reflections of. such an attitude upon an intir
mate social problem. Many people cling hopefully to
principles at long ago which are no longer applicable,
but the great majority have no principles other than
those which uphold a present situation,

Right or wrong this must be accepted as the qualifying

constructions of the American Constitution, ’

condition [or American life. And who can say that the
inevitable is wrong? We become opportunists only in the
face or problems which have their origin in the develop-
ment of the resources or nature. Man cannot foresee
these developments. For this reason no theory of exist-
ence is adequate which does not allow for continuous rev
adjustments in harmony with new discoveries. A reeog»
nitinn of the natural process or growth must necessarily
elimillatc much of the narrowness and illiberalism
ahroﬂd.

WHAT’S WRONG “'lTll GRINNICTL‘I

A Grinnell professor says.tliﬂt one ol the main
masons that there is so much disturbance raised at the
Dorms by Grinnell men, is due to the tool that ll largo
per cent oi the men have no purpose in coming. to col—
lege; no delinilc plans tor the future [or which to pro—
pirc. This is probably more true than anyone hue
ngines. it has even been suggested thnf the trouble
results hour the loci: oi stricter regulations for the
Dorms. However, it is ccrtnin that there is Something
lacking in the life or the men in Griimcll. How to
solvo this problem is the question conironting not
merely the incully, or ndmiuislrntion, or die house
chairmen, or the house councils, but in an cqual me
are, the men themseli s. There seems to bc mis ing
the spirit or cooperation between the men and the
administration. Any new proposnl that is suspected or
haying come in {my wny from this latter group is lought
on the grounds that it is apt to hinder the almost
absolute freedom enjoyed by the mcn.

Therc are three major rules at Grinnell college that
apply directly to the men. First, that there shall be no
use of intoxicating liquor; secoi d, that Iltere shall be
no stealing, and third, that ther ‘sllall be no gambling.
The general tendency is, that snce the, administration
has made these rules, it is thererore up to that body
to enforce them, While the men cnj the sport oi t
ing to break the law without being caught. A poor
house chairman might hold the view, that since he was
elected by the men, it is up to him to protect them from
anything which would keep theln from doing as they
pleased. it was this foot which probably explains the
lailurc or the old court, and it will be the failure or the
new plan or government unless the house
chairmen and the house councils accept the
responsibility or co-operoting with the college adminis»
irnticn. A true Grinnellian will respect Grinnell laws,
but such a. statement only brings forth erclomations'
of scorn. What right does the college have to say that
a man can not drink if he wants to. can not gamble
in he wishes, and can not steal if it pleases him? That
is not the question, whet right the college has to make
such o rule? It should be made clear to the man who
holds such thoughts, that if he wishes to come to Grin
hell he must come with a will to abide by its laws, if
not, he does not honestly want to attend Grinnell, and
Grinnell does not want him. ,

The reason Grinnell has given her men theoripor-
tuiiity oi governing themselves, is because she believes
that n men of college age should be willing to take
some responsibility, that he should he chin to conduct
himself as an intelligent gentleman. But Grinnell has
been disappointed in some of her students. She has
discovered that some of her men have not on yet been
converted into true Grinnellians. Pcrhnps they will lie
in time under the right influence. But this conversion
will only be accomplished when every man feels that
he is port of the college, that the college includes both
faculty and students who must worlr together, and that
there are rules that govern both groups. When this
is done there will be less needless destruction of col-
lege properly . As soon as the thoughts, ”it belongs to
the college so why should we worry" and ”the college
will pay for it," can be abandoned, then a more whole-
su\me spirit will exist on the campus. If the men or
Grinnell expect to enjoy the freedom they now have,
they will have to prove within the next year that they
are capable of conducting themselves as intelligent
men.
