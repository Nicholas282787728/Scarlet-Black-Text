THE HOME SYSTEM.

The question is often asked by
friends of Gl'innell College, "Vlniat,
system does the school use in their.
examinauonst" To be very iranlr with
them, the answer should truthfully
be. “‘No system at all." - Some pro-
fessors will watch their students like
hawks in an effort to ferret out those
that crib, others only partially do
this, while still a third class assume
a wholly indifferent attitude. leaving
it to the discretion of the individual
student to settle the question as to
whether he will clip or not.

What, then, are the results of such
a system? Primarily, it encourages
cheating by the student body. There.
are always a small class who will
cheat under any conditions, if it is
possible. These, in turn, encourage
the great mass of students to cheat al~
so. The class of professors who.
watch their students closely, give the
average student the ieeling that'any-
thing that they can “put over on him"
isperfeotly admissahle. They are not
morally restrained to act otherwise.
The influence of the natural antagon—
ism set up between teacher and stu—
dent in this first class is partially
carried over into the second and third

others.

The real reason why the big
majority of the students cheat in ex-
amination: is because they see their
neighbor doing it, not because they
are inherently deceitful themselves.
All this can be traced to the sun.
class who will cheat under any con-
ditions and whose direct or indirect
influence attracts other students.

Experiences in other colleges has
shown that the honor system is either
entirely successful or is a flat failure.
Enemies ot the system point to the

'cuinedies and fill-cos,

number of ilat failures as adequate
argument against the system But
further research has brought to light
the iact that where the system has
brought failure, it was due to the fact
that insufticient plans for the prac
tice of the system were made, that'
the students did not have a complete‘
understanding of the worhings of rbc‘
plan, and that the system was not
perfected to any degree. The

'And the ulmerclassnlan must. too, feel

No plan in detail is offered here
for any such system. Its success or
failure would rest solely on public
opinion, hill. the attitude at public
opinion would depend upon the ther-
oughness of the system. In the Uni—
versity of Oklahoma the system was
strong enough to force Lhe Captain at
this years football team to leave
school because of cribbing he did in

an examination. Whether Grinnell

ithe student body.

However it seems
that the proposition is reasonable.
logical, and beneficial.

The Y. W. c. A. held the third of,
its series or group meetings Thursday
clening. Freceding group discus- l
stone, Kathryn Ausland led a short de
vutional service, using van Dykes
“Legend of Service." '

The vocational study group discon-
sed the iield of public service, include
ing law, civil service, medicine, and
other sciences no open to women.
Margery Smith surveyed the field of
civil'service where women are on
equal footing with men, working con-
ditions and salaries are good, and
there are excellent opportunities for
study and promotion. “Law needs the
idealism of women," said Elsie Slouf-l
ter, in her survey of this field. In—
ternational law, juvenile courts
and courts of conciliation should
appeal to the women lawyer. The
field of science is limitless in its 0117
purtunitics, according to Elizabeth
Canard. Teaching, lahatory and re.
search u-oi-lr, hospital positions, ems,
ploymerlt as secretaries and librarians

to scientists, and scientific journalism .

are a row of the many divisions or
this field. Miss Lois Green, of the'
zoology department, spoke on women
in medicine. Patience and the abil-
ity to rise above occasional occurenccs
are necessary for the women in this
profession. After
may enter general practice, clinical
and hospital, medical directorships in
various kinds of institutions, surgery,
or foreign practice, where there is
real opportunity for pioneering.

The personal beliefs group, led by
Miss Read, discussed their attitude
toward the Bible. "One may talre
into ccrlsidcration,”~ said Miss Itearl.
"that the writing of the Bible covered
many years during which opinions
constantly changed." People today
do not read the Bible enough to lie-‘

 

’oome acquainted with it, and are apt

to form superficial judgements." l

The world problems group did not
meet this evening, but will meet at
the home of Mrs blncEacbroit Sunday}
evening, to continue their study of the
Orient. Every member of the group
is urged to come.
