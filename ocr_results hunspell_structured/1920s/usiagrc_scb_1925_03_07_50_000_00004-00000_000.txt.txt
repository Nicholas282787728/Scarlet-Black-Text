in the drawing room yesterday after-
noon Bettie Morgan, chairman of the
temporary committee [or the Guild.
presided over the meeting. Reading
and discussion or the constitution was
the order oi business.

dlrs. Flanagan tulked informally on
the outstanding features of the Tona-
ger Guild. The guild, she pointed
out, would pmvide a far more natural
line of cleavage than the former so-
cieties, as these lines would be form-

' ed by natural and unhampered pref-
erencc.

The iguild, she Contiluded must not
be considered as forced on anyone. If
some other plan, whether that of so—
citics or a hitherto unodvanced idea.
really fills the needs of Grinnell won»
eh, it should try all means or, adopted.
The big point is that We shuuld ‘ not
let any proposed means become just
another organization. It must be a
very real and vital part or the lives of
Grinncll women, or it must not exist
at all. _ l

Before Mrs. Flanagan talked, Gladys
Prall sang "Pale Hands," Julie Jensen
played a. romance by Beethuven, and
Ruth Norton gave a Grieg nocturne‘.
