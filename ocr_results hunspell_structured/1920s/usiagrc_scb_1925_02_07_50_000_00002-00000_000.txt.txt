mi Seen from_CrinneN]

(All inter-lieu uitll Prof. Charles E.
Payne).

All at Washington seems to be age;
over the growing breach between
President Coolidge and George Har-
Ve, tax-ambassador to England. Har-
vey was originally a dyedrinvthewvool
Democrat, claiming that it was he who
put Wilson on the map and eventually
had him made president. However, a
quarrel arose between the two; Hal»
vey went over to the Republicans, and
claims to have “made" the late Presi»
(lent Harding.

As our ambassador at the Court of
St. James be distinguished himself by
his irresponsib ty and misrepresenta-
tion of America; but upon his return
he was made editor oi the Washington
Post, which is regarded as the semi-
official organ oi the administration.

Since Coolidge’s election in his own
name, however, the breach between
the two men seems to be growing.
l-li-lrvey has become an out and out
critic uf‘hoth President Coolidge and
Secretary Hughes. Since he wields
what is probably the most effectively
vituperatlve pen in America, he is
proving to be as uncomfortable c
thorn in the President's side as he was
during the administration of “Voodl‘ow
Wilson.

The deadlock after the last German
election, due to the failure of any Dill"—
Ly or (:(llllhinatiun of parties to get a
lilajority in the Relcllstng, has finally
been broliell. A cabinet above pal-ties
has been organized. or. Luther, oi
the People's party (the Big Business
party). is Chancellor, and Stl’csomann
of the, same party is fortligll secretary,
But for the fir“. time since the War
Nationalists (illose who favor the \nﬂll»
orally) are included ill the cabinetia
cabinet which call Duly remain in of-
{ice through the neutrality of the Calh-
olic or Center party, which holds the
key to the situation.

The presence of the National , has
caused considerable alarm and ml in.

derstanding |D Europe and America ,

among people who resi- that the cir—

oumstrtuce may result in the restora—
tion oi the monarchy.

As a matter or tact, however, the Re—
publicans increased their voting

strength in the last election, and the
working classes and Socialists in Ger-
many realize that the Nationalists are
their worst enemies since the working

:classes are above all things bitterly
opposed to militarism. Most of the dis
closures made to the commission in-
quiring into Germany's preparedness
were made by German wor 'ngmen.

The real significance or the Nation-
alists' appearance in the Cabinet s

that it commits that party to the
Dawes plan and to a working accepr
tsnce. at least, oi the Republic.

The government, or course, is un-
doubtedly an unstable one. and is furs
thcr weakened by the reiusal of the
Allies to leave the cologne arca.

I

1 An apparent change oi iront on the
part of Premier Hcrriot is causing a
good deal of unnecessary alarm. His
recent extremely nationalistic utter-
ahces may be traced to the loci that
the Allies can't evacuate the cologne
area without evacuating the Ruhr al—
so; and Her-riot is unwilling to evac-
uate the Ruhr until the security or

France is guaranteed,
