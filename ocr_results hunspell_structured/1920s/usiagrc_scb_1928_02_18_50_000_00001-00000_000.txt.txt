PHESENTATIDN DE
PLAY AT THEATHE
IS WELL HANDLED

Staging of Play Dominates Over
Acting In “Gods of The
Mountain” Friday.

{SCENE .OF PLAY IS ORIENT

Careful Detail Used. In Costumes
Is Outstanding Feature of
Dunsany Drama.

By Aileen Cohen.

Saturated with oriental atmosphere
and presented by a capable cast, “The
Gods of the Mountain" by Lord Dun.
sany, was one of the most admirable
plays which has been presented by the
Experimental Theatre, in fact, the
staging of the play unite conspicuous-
ly outshone the acting, and left afar
groater impression with the audience
than any of the lines or their speak-
ers.

The plot, somewhat allegorical,
showed seven beggars. who, by im-
personating the seven gods of the
mountains, duped the villagers into
providing them with elaborate offer-
ings of food. Their retribution came
when one of the actual gods of the
mountain appeared in all his jade
splendor and turned the impostors in.
to stone. A touch of irony was di -
played in the fact that the villagers.
who for a time had doubted the auth-
enticity of the beggar-gods, believed
that it was this distrust which had
chnnged their gods into stone.

Gray Plavs Loading nolo.

Russell Cray. who was master or
the beggars and leader of the gods,
portrayed the most important charter—
lzation in the play. He was seldom
out of character, but was surpassed
slightly in this respect by his trusting
attendant, Henry Bray. With these
two exceptions, and Lola Carpenter,
whose lines were all too few. the oth-
er characterg were all more or less
on a par. For the training of voices.
for the rarity of rough spots, and for
the success or the dramatic scenes,
Mrs. oitilie T. Seybolt. director, dc.
serves to be especially complimented.

The most outstanding contribution
to the atmosphere of this imaginary
oriental country, which might have
been Arabia. Turkey, or even ludia,
was the careful detail given to the
costumes and hand properties of the
entire cast in order to provide local
color. The stage settings and lights
together were so\2ffeclive as to his
tract attention to themselves. at times
to the exclusion of the play.

The oriental musical numbers play-
ed between ncts by the Experimental
Theatre Orchestra, lacked enough vol.
time to make them convincing: but as
soft accompaniments during the play,
they contributed effectively to the at-
mosphere.
