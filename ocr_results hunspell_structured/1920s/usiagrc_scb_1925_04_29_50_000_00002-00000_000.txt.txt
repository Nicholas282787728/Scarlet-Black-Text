OUR OBLIGATIONS

With the publication of this issue
the new management takes charge of
the Scarlet and Black. Reallzih§ihe
part in campus life that this paper
has played. and knowing that it has
been due to the capability at our pre-
decessors. we take over the reins with
a burdening feeling of responsibility
and duty. We are not launching forth
with a "bigger and better" slogan. for
we are more immediately concerned
with reaching the standard that oth
ers have set for us. If we can in any
measure do that. we will feel that we
have been successful.

‘We see the task cut out ior us. that
or portraying for the student body. as
accurately and vividly as we can, the
activities and interests or Grinneii.
We shall be open to suggestions that
will enable us to serve you better and
we invite your criticism rather than
your silence. In our editorials we
hope to he tolerant and broad minded.
No doubt we will make mistakes blit
they will be unintentional and due on-
tirely to our own stupidity.

We realize that we have contracted
for a hard job. but more than any
thing else do we feel that we are ob-
ligated to the college to put out a
creditable paper. It must he done but
we can do no more than promise our
best. and hope that it does not lall‘ too

far short.

THE ESSENTIALS

The subject of cuts and flunk day
leads to the consideration of that
more general topic. the attitude of the
student toward college work. The po-
sition that is taken in regard to this
will depend to a certain extent upon
the theory of education in which one
believes.

The belief which seems most tenr
able of all. is that you cannot teach a.

person anything The knowledge can
I

be made accessible, in as interesting a,

term as possible. and alter that it is
entirely- within the hands or the sins
dent whether or not he educates him-
sell. if he has an energizing lorce
within him he will realize that he is
his own instructor and go after the
material at hand. it he depends upon
the prolessor to teach it to him. pound
it in. so to speak. he will never be
benelited rely much it he goes to
classes five years without an absence.

it is doubtful whether there can be
a direct corollary drawn between at—
tcndancc and grades. or course. the
cutting of classes is not advisable. it
is neither wise nor practical for con-
tlnued absences are bollnd to lessen
the interest which is so essential to
scholarship. But alter all if too much
significance is attached to cuts then is
there not a danger of lorgctting the
most vital factor? Surely the most
einphuSis needs to he placed upon the
attitude or the student toward sell-21L

“cation.

THE KAISER AGAIN
It is an item ol.‘ importance to note
that ﬁeld inorshall Paul Von Hinden-
biirg has been elected president of the
German republic. The famous general

 

 

of the recent war deieated the repub-
lican and communist candidates, run-
ning on the nationalist ticket which
was known to be iavorable to the re-
turn or a monarchy.

In a recent communication. Hinden-
burg pledged his fealty and support to
the Kaiser. Does this mean that there
is a possibility or the‘return of the
old monarch? It would seem that it
is in the mind of the field marshall
to out the Hohenzollcrns back on the
throne.

For a time the street lighting and
general disorder pointed toward civil
war but now all is quiet and the peo-
ple are at least temporarily content.
it will be interesting to watch the de-
velopments that are liable to grow
lrom this situation. during the next
iew months. Here in Grlnuell we are
not so tar removed from Europe that
we can ailord to ignore a signilicant

l
political action in Germany.

OFFICIA NOTICE.

Applications for scholarships and
employment should be riled at the
