Eridently Grinnell is not the only college whose ad-
niinistration has an idealistic attitude toward an utlileti
policy. president Ernest in, Hopkins of Dartmouth has
a new plan ior intercollegiate football. Grinnell must
either drop out of the Missouri Valley, coiil'orni to its
standards, or adopt some such plan as this. We, now—
ever, would not hhe lo see Gl‘inncll drop out oi the Valley
and we do not believe the Dartmouth plan feasible.

Brieny the plan is thi that varsity competition
should be limited to members or the sophomore and jtle
nior classes, that coaching should be contined to under»
graduates and that two varsity elovens should he provid-
ed for homerﬂndrhome gsines

Eastern gridiron author 'es are almost unanimously
opposed to the suggestion, as we believe Missouri Valley
officials would be it presented with the proposition. oiic
outstanding reason is, at course, that the so-cnlled au-
thorities are in many cases professional coaches irii -
jobs would be done away with.

Aside from the coaches‘ objections, the plan would
lower the standard of the sport,/\»’ould make it less ex-
pert, in fact reduce it almost to a nice. rough game ior
overgrown boys. Undergraduate coaches would not have
the necessary qualiﬁcations from year to year, as they
stepped into the positions, to ettieiently coach a team,
Limiting varsity competition to two years would put a
premium on athletes and in many cases it would not be
worth while to go out for the sport. There would ne-
cessarily have to be some director of an athletics, iihicli
would again bring the situation back into the realm of

weather is increasing, but the proportion is not relativcli‘
euiiul. \ic haic a suggestion to nialte irliicli may lie
good, bad or iiidiiieiciit and which will probably cause
a raising of eyebrows.

Bluntly, the majority of chapel talks are written out
by the speakers biit the inajoi' y at the inoie interesting
ones are not. The more the spedkei dispenses with the
pages before him on the altar, the better does he ham.
and impress his strident audience. Notes are not objec‘
tronahle, it the user is not a slave to them But when
the speaker huries his head in his written speech, thinly
g asps the altar and exponnds at great length, only pans

is not able to see how many or the enduring listener
are asleep,

There are those who will contend that when one
goes to cbapcl iic should care tor the content of the
speech enough to ignore the other detai ., that it is the
thought alone which counts and not the manner or ﬂee
livery, that college students should have advanced to an
intellectual plane \VllK-h does not require "tricks" to hold
their attention. However. students continue, laineiitalily
enough. to hold with the mob and demand that they be
spoken to, not at.

For example, a short time ago an instruc‘tor gave a
talk on the election of one or the pi sidents, which it
“read." would have been very "dry. But he used no
notes and rented directly to the students. They liked it
and discussed it niter chapel. Still more recently another
instructor gave a talk. The instructor was a slave to
notcs and gave the habitual monologue. students who
could get away were seen migrating in all directions hi.»

Two instances do not milks a generality, biit they

The proposed organization oi .i u itei- club lict unv
named) will fill a gap in Grinnell actiii ies which has
been present since the dissolution of the literary some
eties sorcnlled, in 15‘24 and lnzs. Although the societies
Illi have had a literary nature in the beginning, they
had developed into desiiitory dchatiug uiiioi . The Grim
neil Forensic has taken care at debating. but until the
pr :eili. time there has been no stricth literary society
on the campus.

The new ciiib has as its membership qualification the
publication or one or more articles in the college liter-or.
magazine either VERSE AND FICTION, TiiE JU\ 0, or
TIIE TANAGER. Its emphasis is upon creative literature
rather than critical review and discussion,

There is only one objection to the club, the limita-
tion of its membership. The present qualifications are
all right to begin with, but we believe that as the organ
zatiou becomes more sound new members should he no
cepted who submit manuscripts of a satifactoi-y nature to
the club and thereby include persons on the campus with
have the ability to write but perhaps need a little more
encouragement to give their work notice.
