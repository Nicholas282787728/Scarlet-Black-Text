COURT, SI: ‘ATE AND LEAGUE BOARD.

The annual spring Court and Senate elections bring
to our attention an issue that vitally concerns the lite
of Quadrangle and Dormitories. The outcome at this is-
sue will he more tar-reaching in its consequences than
any other single problem racing the institution at this
time, [or it means the success or iailure or a pioneering
attempt at strident government controlled by students with
iaculty backing, but without their interference. The
ouestion is this Is the student government actually lul-
iilling its purpose, or is there something inherently wrong
with the system that makes ettective student government
impossible. '

Undergraduate and faculty groups alike are wonder
ing which way the pendulum will swing next—whether
toward stricter or more lax enforcement. Perhaps one or
the most significant items in getting a clearer insight in-
to‘ the question is right at this point. Although faculty
and undergraduate bodies are both considering the Inner
[inning of the governing groups they are not Viewing it
with the some thought ill mind. There are students who
would delight In seeing a minimum of restraint with a
maximum 01 individual liberty. The faculty, on the other
hand, are inclined to believe that it somewhat lll‘mei' nd~

ministration would be most beneﬁcial tor a larger iiuni-
llcr or students. .
or voulse. the lrrst at the,
feel, bu society ls constituted today, a certain amount
or law i .l recogn ed lic csslty and until all people will
behave and think a {e in these matters, a law will have
to sub Act thcriiscll to tho will DI the major-it
bill) one will ilglce t liccmlse 01' its inherent
urili ples. Scllrgovclnmellt an invaluable element in
the spirit and lile or any in.- rtuliou. But the prevailing
opililolr ol tbosc governed tllc ruling [actor in the sncs
core or lalllll-c oi the lauucnforcclueut, It the gencrnl
student Doll; is not sympathetic with tho spirit of the
laws which its rcprcscntulivos have dccidcd to be best
lol' the good or all. and if the Izt\v»ell[ol'cillg body refuses
to tarry out the will or the legislative body, perhaps it
only goes to prove that the main 'ty ' not able to govern
itself. Perhaps a Mussolini as President of the college

would serve more adequately than a democracy. 1

Disregard at law is not peculiar to the College alone,
but is mercl another cvrdciicc ot‘ the general attitude
shown tonal-d ltlltlml'ity all over the country. Young peas
ble are no worse than those oi nlore mature use in the
matter of conformance with law, and as a matter or fact,
are usually not as bad. Students who have grown up with
the r Suluptian that rebellion against enforced authority
is one of their inalienable rights, even though it is the
authority of a government in which they are represented,
will naturally have a disrespect [or law. l

As for the faculty, in all justice let us recognize that
it was they who granted student government in the Iii-st
place, believing it to be a sound venture, and that they
have always been ready to cooperate wholeheartedly
with the studcnt body. Some iaculties \\'e have known in
other schools have ruled with an iron haiid creating a
wide breach between the two ol‘gnnizatiunsiu disunity
never [cit on the Grinnell campus. \Ve need not add that
of course we are heartily in accoi'd with the Grinnell
sentiment. Note, however, that we do not go so far as
to state that faculty domination would be impossible even
here.

The Griunell Student government has one innate
ueulillcss that goes far in preventing the accomplishment‘
or its best purposes. A League Board, which must make
the law. apprehend those that break it, and then adminis—
ter the penaltr is at once handicapped. A court whose
members are chosen on a basis primarily of popularity,‘
with little reterencc to ability or desire ior orlice, and
who act both as policemen and Judges, is obviously limit-
ed at the outset. [

We would like to see some sort or separation of the
policing from the judicial inaction of the court. Policing‘
ls extremely distasteful to League Board and court mem—
ber alike. But those who accept the honor of the ullice_
should be ready also to accept the responsibility that goes
with it and until a better remedy for the problem is or-l

l tered, student government as it exists should be support» l
ed,

A rcturn to the old system of government under the
lcollcge administration would he a distinct and irreparable
loss and there is no likelihood that any such action will'
take place for a good while to come. Earnest consider-
ation oi what such a step would mean will help toward
the realization of the value of strident government and
might lniluence support of its purpose.
