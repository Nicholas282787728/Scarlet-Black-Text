Crown Prince (his .llvus Adolphus And
Brown Princess Delighted with
American roseils.

DONARD EXCHANGES SEEDS

Canard Was Superintendent of Ranger
Naturalists In Yellowstone Park
Entire Summer.

(13: Rose Gem)

The honor of spending a day with
the Royal Party of the Crown Prince
Gustavus Adolphus and the Crown
Princess of Sweeden, On their tour
through Yellowstone National Park,

was but one of the interesting and

delightful duties performed by Pro-
fessor H. S. Canard in his office of
Superintendent of Ranger Naturalists.

The Royal party was escorted
through the park by Stephen other,
Director of National Parks. H Al-
bright, superintendent of Yellowstone,
and Secretary of Interior work. Pm-
fessor Canard was detailed to meet
the Prince and Princess andmttend~
ants at Crescent Hill, that he might
show them the newly discovered bed
of fossil leaves. «“1 showed them the
deposit,“ Mr. Cunard tells us, "and as
requested by Superintendent Albright,
explained it to the Prince, who is a
learned man and, intense/1y interested
in botany. His Highness was not
content with the knowledge of the
fact that the bed contained fossil re-
mains of the willow, chestnut sycd»
more, pine and redwood; he wished to

know the Latin names that ho inight‘
better associate them With species ll},

his own country."

Professor Conztl'd was not only a
member of the party durio‘g the re—
mainder of the tour, but he Sat next
to the Prince while driving and/ ac—

: companied him on foot. This his Idigh~

ness requested as he wished 'to know
the names of the flowers and plants.
Princess Secs Buffaloes

The Royal group and their escorts
had luncheon at Camp Roosevelt.
Here Professor Canard had had the
floral decorations especially arranged
to represent the Swedish flora and
Swedish botanists. The Crown Prince
immediately caught the idea and ex—
pressed his enjoyment. .

"After a greatneal of photograph.
ing, the party drove fifteen miles up
Inmar valley. Here the mode of travel
was changed to four horse stage
coaches; we landed the Sodit Butte
creek, and drove across to Drift Fence,
where four hundred buffaloes were in
waiting. The herders drove the herd
back and forth past the coaches, but
the Prince wishing to get it still bet—
ter view of them, mounted a horse
and, much to the dismay of the Crown
Princess, rode around the edge of the
herd. A cowboy gave a demonstration
of lassoing and rope-throwing and

‘lncidentally lassoed the prince. How.
ever, his Highness seemed to enjoy it
immensely."

To Exchange Seeds

Professor Cunard arranged to ex—
change the wild flower seeds with
flower seeds from the Royal Botanical
gardens of Stockholm and from the
Prince's private garden. Some seeds
and pressed flowers from Yellowstone
National Park have already been sent
’nnd Mr. Cunard hopes to send some
lowa seeds in a short time.

The Prince has only recently comrt

pieted his tour of the United'smtes,
and although it was only semi—official
in nature, his Royal Highness expreSSr
ed sentiments to Prof. Conard which
were in sympathy with the movement
toward international acquaintance and

> understanding.

This is the second year Prof. Corr
aid has been a. ranger naturalist, this
year as ‘Superintendent of Ranger
Naturalists. His duties were to show
tourism lthrough Camp Roosevelt.

Misshrucia Dedlnsky; instructor in
French: "wet: Very wetl But seri-
ously, the thins that impressed me
most is the campus and your lovely
trees There is a spaciousness here
that gives one a. sense of freedom.
Yesterday 1 was walking down one of
the streets and the horizon,’ framed
with trees. was so blue that it looked
like the sea. This is all very differ-
ent from foreign schools. at the Uni-
versity of Birmingham in England
there is no campus at all. Then too.
I think your chapel exercises are an
exceptionally good thing. It is good
for the faculty and students to get to—
gether for a few minutes each day
On the whole I think you are a very
bright crowd."

Pliul D. Knight instructor in speech:
I have been most impressed with the
high type of students here. They are
an upraild-comlng, wide awake lot, l
have seen none of the slovenly minded
unkempt type that is so prevalent
nowadays. The spirit of cordiallty is
also very outstanding here," ‘

Miss Leah Pratt, instructor in wide;
“I was surprised at Grinnell’s East-
ern atmosphere. I did not expect any-
thing like this in the Middle West.
But besides the atmosphere there is
the lovely cumlms and the friendliness
of, all thn facility and students."

initial novel, "Country People.",and
her more recent success, “The OdeSr
soy of a Nice Girl."

During the past, ununcr, Guinnell
had for the second lule the privilege
of being represented by Dl‘. Luella J.
head at the Chicago Art ins itnte for
the courses in art and Ml. appreciation
provided for ten selected schools by
the Carnegie Corpnmtiun. , The origi—
nal plan of the Carnegie Foundation
was Experimental in nature and aimed
AT. the creation of interest in all. all-
m-eciation among the schools and col—
leges of the countlp Of the ten
schools requested to send representa—
tivesvfol‘ the courses conducted at the
'Art institute, Grinncll received dis-
tinctive prniae‘ from the director of the
course who made the statement that
the interest manifested ftt Gl-llmell
alone assured the success of uic ex»
Dcl‘lment and fully justified the tntél
expenditure of the Carnegie Corpor-
ation as well Its 21 cautlnuution of the
plan. ,

Add ll‘oll Institutions l

Miss Redd reports that Grimiell had
the higllestyerccntnge 01‘ her Stllde’nt
body under enlollmenf for the Fri
courses of Ellly of the ten colleges.
”Ten additional illétltutions,” Said
Miss Read, ”were added to the list of

those afforded the opportunity by the

Carnegie Corporation, The majority
of these ten were southern institu-
tions. The work this summer con-
sisted of lectures by leading fepl‘esem
tatives in each field of art and inclu-
ded practical work in drawing ,and a
study of original masterpieces. Tours

were conducted about Chicago for the.

purpose of studying modern architec,
tural forms. Landscape architecture
was studied on the grounds of the
most beautiful estates: on the North
Shore

"The Carnegie Corporation is mak-
ing an additional gift to Grinnell this
year, providing the slides which will
be used in the art courses. A course
in ar‘t appreciation similar to unit
which created so much interest on the
campus ﬁrst year will be available
next semester, while the results of
this summer's work will he incorpor-
ated iii/{he other courses."

More Men Enroll ,

The increased enrollment of men in
these courses Miss Read regards as an
exceptional advantage to Grlnnell for
the Foundation uses this as a basis
for evaluating the success of the col-
lege art course

vParticular credit for the record
Grinnell has made with the .Carnegie
Foundation is due Miss Read, for it is
under her direction and through her

efforts that the contribution of the.

Carnegie Corporation has resulted in
this singular distinction for Gi-inncll.
