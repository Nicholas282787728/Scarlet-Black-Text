lo the Editor:

To those of iis who have been in the _

chool and college business for over
crty years the loyalty of
hip, which seems to he the vital point
n the present difficulty in the rninds
f our men, is not new. We under-
~tand it, respect it, believe in it. pass-
ng by the question whether there are
u‘gher loyalties, to the community, to
be state, etc, let us accent the code
f Friendship. In every case I have
-ver ltnown before, Friendship has
wo sides. There is a loyalty of the
oilty to the innocent. The innocent

Friend '

 

will not save their paltly souls oy in4
volving the guilty. conversely, the
guilty will not let their innocent
iriends be perjured tor their protect
ion. The guilty boy will, when ‘fin-
ally cornered, save his irionds irom
disgrace lyy coming across with at
least a suificlent statement or his
guilt to clear his friends. I have
even known boys who would claim
the whole guilt and tulre the whole
punishment. to save their guilty
friends. That kind of lying has an
air 0! respectability. But the kind
that lcts one or two men carry the
guilt or the crowd is quite another
thing. Friendship which stands on
the two strong logs of mutual ohlign.
tion is a line thing. an only one leg, it
is lame indeed.
