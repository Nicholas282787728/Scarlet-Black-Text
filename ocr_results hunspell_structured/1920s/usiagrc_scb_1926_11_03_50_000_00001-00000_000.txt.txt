DEVELOP VARIED ATTACK

wttli might in both Iinckricld .tnd
Line, prop ream Is Expected to
Make Gootl Showing.

Coach Hayes freshman football team
is beginning to take on the appearance
of a well—oiled machine as work pru-
gresses toward the game with the
Washington Bear “Cubs" next Saturr
day at St. Louis.

This Week’s easing up by the varsity
has given the frosh a chance to work
on their own offensive which has coll~
sequently shown much improvement,
The attack which has been adopted is
a va ed one, the backfield beiug c'apa~
his or good'mnning, passing or line
smashing, With plenty of weight in
bo‘Llyhfickfielfl and line the young Pio-
neers should-give Washington'sfrosh
an interesting hour.

Rice Has ros. ih'tles

At center is Rice, six foot husky,
who has shown great possibilities, and
although he has been a little erratic
at times, be is expectd to develop into
a class A. pivot man. ,

The guard stock dropped a poiirtr‘rl—
day when Parish. a regular, suffered
an ankle injury in a practice game
with the varsity. The other outstandr
ing- 'guards are Kiesel, Widiinere,

' Bradley and Heldridge. The latter
pair are also capable of relieving Rice
at center.

There is considerable competition at
tackle, with Lair, Kleinfelter, Barnes,
p'belps and Carr fighting it out, Carr,
erstwhile halfback, has recently been
shifted to the line and with his speed
should make a real tackle. Lair and
Carr have been getting first call at
the positions,

Good Eluls

With plenty of speed and weight
available, the job of picking the ends
is'no easy one. Turner is probably
the outstanding prospect, while
Iiriggs, Sbarnborg’and Gustafson are
all good material.

At fullback is’Rase, a triple threat
man weighing about lilo pounds. He
is strong and fast and backs up the
line well.

There is a welath of material at the
halves. Meeter and Leidtke have been
playing first string. Meeter, a brother
of "Butch," is alsocapable of running,
passing or kicking. Leldtke’s prep
experience was at fullbaekand either
he or Meeter can be called upon to
take Rose's place. He is a fast and
clever runner and defensive man. 0th-
er promising halves are Maytum,
Keaton and Conant

li'fclntire, quarterback, is a speedy
lad who can also be classified as the
wielder of a triple threat. At safety
he is a neat handler of punts and a
reliable ’tztckler. He is relieved by Der
Long, an adept signal caller.

colors of our favor on our servitors.

In fact, the class of loan is leaving

Officials Report NO

Hallowe’eri Deaths

With the Hollowe'cll rusu over, the
Scarlet and Black reporter at last
managed to secure an interview today
with Chief Manson who had licen in
bed asleep since Saturday night. Mr.
Manson said that he had no message
to give to the people, except that he
found the college faculty much hard-
er tb control this Hallowe’en than in
previo’us years.

The most heinous crime that any
of them perpetrated was the placing
of a loaded alarm clock in Herrick
chapel. A speaker was the innocent
victim of the infernal machine, while
the mental machinery (if any) of bull-
dreds of students who attended the
ratal services has been thrown into
confusion and set back about three
hours Dean Findlay was observcd
inquiring at the President's office for
the clock some time later, but it is
not known uhcthcr it was a case of
deep conspiracy or whether Mr, Filldr
lay inst hated to lose the clock and
hoped to pose as the innocent dupe of
spine ostensible master mind.

Another bad case was the upheaval
of that famous vchiclc popularly
known as Cottage vi and parking it in
front of Goodnow ball. This buggy
plays a vcr important part in the
campus life, as from its trick windows
the collitch innc boys are somctiiucs
wont to serve hamburgers and pop at
a reasonable profit. While several
persons are under observance the net
of suspicion seems to center around
Oscar, who it is thought attempted to
do away with are quick lunch wagon
from motives of Jealousy.

Upper-classmeu will not he startled
at these revelations, as they will re-
member that last year it was neces
sary to subpoena a large number of
the facility who were dragged from
the class rooms by the iron hand of
the lilw in spite of the pleadings or
the students that they be allowed to
remain until the end of the hour.

Mr, Manson optimistically predicts
that the crisis has again been safely
averted, although a final report can-
not be given until all 'llle examination
papers are returned. However, the
police force is taking no chances and
leaving no loopholes uncovered, and
'both of them may be found at any

time of night by vigorously calling
their homes.

Elisslllliri-Oltlillmlu I}! 'II Is Feilhlre

of This Week's Grim , Drake '
Takes Eilrllell Rest

Crinncll tackles a tough customer
this week end when the Pioneer team
lourneys to Lawrence to battle the
Kansas iayhawkers. D yen to des-
peration by a series of hard reverses
in all three of its Valley starts, the
Cappou coached team will doubtless
be on edge and set to battle the Pio-
neers to a standstill.

Grinncll will enter the battle with
the prospect of two or perhaps three .
of her most formidable ground-gainers
out of the action. Arden McClain add-
ed a new bump to his glass knee 1m-
day which threatens to keep llim‘on
the bench for several weeks. 'The
scrappy little nuartcrback is under-
going medical treatment in Des
Moincs this week, which may change
the condition of the injury, Stotts is
not expected to start, although he is
fast rounding into shape. The third
member of the trio is Meetcr, the
leading ground gainer, ,puuter' and
passer of the Scarlet and Black team,
who is bothered not a little by a bad
hip, ,

Missouri )Icl‘ls Oklllltullltt

Grinnell is not the only one of the
four Valley pacemakers who is facing
a dangerous problem inholding her
lead this week end. Missouri is bat-
tling Oklahoma university on Okla~
homd’ territory and tennis who have
visited the Sooners home camp say
that they are always good for two ex—
tra touchdowns at home. Missouri
has a punch to come through in pieces-
sity, ’o point which seems characteris-
tic of Coach Henry’s teams.

There may be only one team claim.
ing the top position in the standings
after this week’s games.‘ That team
my be the Kansas Aggies who take on
Marquette university at Milwaukee.
Grinnell holds a tap-heavy victory ov~
er the Golden Avalanche, and the re-
sults of the Aggie game may shed a
little light on a rather complicated
dope sheet.

The Oklahoma Aggies are to play at
home, using the Washington univer-
sity team as the attraction. Washing-
ton has yet to win a conference game,
having been turned, back in her rour
starts“ The Aggies have a shade in
their hdvztntage in weight and previ-
ous gilmes. In case the Bears db
come through with a victory, the Ag-
gies will be delegated to several spa-
ces below the top.

Nebraska ls Strong

Nebraska showed surprising power
in trimming the Ames Cyclones last
Saturday, 31—6 The Cornhuskers and
Cyclones both rest this week, the Ne-
braska team to prepare for the Kon-
sas Aggies and Ames to get in shape
to stop Everett of Drake.

Drake, a team which has been im-
proving by 1 oils and bounds, since a
bad beginning, is also taking a res-
pite, before heading out for strong
competition with Ames, Notre Dame
and the Haskell Indians. Chuck Ev-
erett, Drake’s big threat, again this
season is swinging into his stride and
as displayed in the last two games, is
in line for a lot or recognition from
critics, and lots of fear from oppon-
ents. Everett is strongly supported
by an aggro '6 team.

Missouri’s win over West Virginia
came as rather a surprise to Valley
fans, who expected the highly touted
Mountaineers to ‘lul'n back the Tigers.
Hewevcr, according to witnesses, the
Bengal boys played a smart game of
football, taking advantage of evcl‘y bad
move of the Morgautown team. In—
ter-ccpted passes played a big part in
the 2770 triumph Perhaps the Tiger's
ability to snag aerial attempts will be
tested this week cud.

The lack of punch in the Jayhawker
team has been the big weakness of
that outfit. By far the heaviest and
raugicst team In the conference. the
Kansas team should be a tower of
strength on both offense and defense.
With the return or several capable
Jayhawk backs to the lineup on Sat-
urday, Kansas will be ”out for blood."
