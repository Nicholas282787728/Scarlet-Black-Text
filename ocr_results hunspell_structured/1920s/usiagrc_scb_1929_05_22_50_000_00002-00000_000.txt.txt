.A ‘xemi-‘retklv newspaper published every
Wednesday and Saturday of the collcge year by
the Itudcms at Grinnrll Collcgc.

Entered is second class matter it the post
otticc at Glinnell, Iowa, under the not at
March 3, 1979.

Vol. XX ' . No. 58.
WEDNESDAY, MAY %, 1925).

PLEASE REMIT.

It’s about this time of the year.
Yes. it ’s about the time of the ycar
when students. worried over ﬁnals,
and term papers. wondering if
they will have summer jobs.rushed
witll the regular routilie of school
and the. extra activities that creep
into the last few weeks, are ill-
clincd to overlook current bills,
standing accounts and the like.

Grinncll merchants gladly cxv
tend credit to students because
they realize tllat most of them are
on monthly allowances and require
some time before they can entirely
pay for their purchases. They, no
doubt, are equally aware that more
merchandise is sold on tllc credit
plan than on the cash. Conser
quently, a major part of the stu-
dent business is done in this man-
ner, Yet there is always a. tinici
for settling up, always a day of
reckoning. ‘

It is most natural for students,
rushed with the finals of another
school year, to forget, neglect, or;
otherwise overlook payments of,
their charge accounts. Credit is'
valuable to students, in fact, it is
indispensable in many cases. It
holds then that that credit should
not be abused. It is the student’s‘
duty not only to the merchant but
to himself allfl fellow students, to,
pay his bills. Bad credit rating’
to one student will no doubt in-
directly affect another.

If students, ﬁnding it difficult
to adjust their ﬁnances the last
month of school. cannot pay their
bills, the only thing,r for them to do
is to arrange with their creditors
for a future settlement. It is much
easier than dodging collectors
over the summer and much better
than bringing a bad reputation to
student credit, creating the gell-
cral opinion that students are bill-
dodgers.

THE VALUE OF AN ANNUAL,

As the 1930 Cyclone makes its
appearance shortly, the question
should be raised as to just what
value this annual, or any annual,
has in Griinlell, A Cyclone is a
good advertisement for prospec-

tive students Most sturlcntsto-bc
no doubt read the Cyclone thor-
oughly before they peruse the col-
lege catalogue.

As a lnemor book for Grinncll
students the C clone undoubtedly
has its place. Seniors like to have
pictures of their classmates and of
the building groups with which
they associate.

Then, too, therc is the atmos-
phere of a year which can be prey
served only in pictures such as are
found in an annual.

75 Students
Can’ t Be Wrong

Even a prof would be convinced it
75 students all gave him the same an»
swer to his question. Ask any of our
last Summer's student salesmen about
the Consumer‘s Merchandise Associa—
tion offer and the answer will be the
same~"You Can‘t Go Wrong With
Consumer’s.” If You are earning
your way through school. you will ﬁnd
our proposition interesting. Investi-

his home in Connecticut, to Mexico,’
to Sumatra, and to other ports of the
the world to observe an eclipse of,
the sun. And seven times has hc'

only to disappear just as suddenly.

though one has been to nine and uh—

Prof. H. L. Curtis, of the Allegheny
Observatory of Pittsburgh, who cc.

?ccut trip to Sumatra, as he has on
previous expeditions, has been to the

The president ol the University of
California, Dr. w. w. Campbell, has
[been to eight eclipse tracks. However
on two occasion he has had clouds

seen six like Doctor Curtis,

Prof. s. A Mitchell, of the Univer-
sity of Virginia, has been to seven.
But on his last expedition, to Norway
in 192', he had cloudy Weather, so
that he has also seen six.

Due government astronomer, Prof.

G. H. Peters, has can in six, none
of which have been completely cloud-

Plates Made of Eclipse by Scientists
May Verify Einstein Relativity Theory

Apparently the only two of tho ex-
peditions that assayed this experiment
that bod clear wchthcr were those of
Professor Miller, and of Dr. Walter
Baade, from Hamburg, Germany, in
Cebu, one of the Philippine Islands.
At Alor Star, in Kedah. and Poflani.
in Sumatra, Where two British cx—
vcditions were located, clouds Ser-
iously hampered observations.

Professor Miller's success, with the
eclipse occurring right in the center
of a perfectly clear spot, is especially
fortunate, because of his cooperation
with the naval observatory party at
Iloilo, iu the Philippines, which was
also successful. At both places iden-
tical Cameras, 62 feet long, giving no
image of the sun 7 rz inchcs in di~
Zinleter, were used. The same kind
of plates, and exposures of thesnme
duration were made at both places.
This was the first time that such an
experiment had been tried, and as the
cclipsc occurred at Iloilu about an
hour later than Sumatra, the two sets
of plates should show how inpidly
the corona moves.

The rest of the naval observatory
parties were quite successful, despite

thin cirrus clouds, it was found after
the plates had been developed. Dr.
R. L. \Vaterfield, who has located
nearby, was not so Iortunate. After
developing his plates lie found that
the clouds had greatly impaired them.

Undoubtedly important
concerning the Einstein theory, as
well as other scientific ideas, will
come from these eclipse plates, but
not before molly months. Not until
they return to the safety of their ob-
servatorios will the astronomers hc-
gin their exhaustive examination and
measurement. And then these meas-

results,

and laborious calculations. So the
attendance of an eclipse is but the
the beginning of work for an astron»
omel‘, and those who had cloudy
weather at least have the satisfaction
of knowing that that they are saved
much labor!
