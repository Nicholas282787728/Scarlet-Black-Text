Grinnell’s “Acute” Dating
Situation Draws Comment
From Penn College Paper

'An echo or thc Gl'illnell situation is

lollowiig article is taken irom the
Penn Chronicle:

—they are all out or iashion and not

notice sent to the modern lad.

Dating is not only out at date on
Penn's campus, out rs it also obsolete
on the northern neighbor's campus
Grinnell. The girls there are simpl,
illriousland are demanding a change.
\\lllle the women at Penn simply
don't give a “hang," maybe they are
resigned to it,

in this day of modernism the
ilapper co-ed can openly buy her
own cigarettes, put on men's cloth:
ing a speak or sex without cringing,
so a man to her is not the essential
that he tormerly was, The Penn
women are certainly advancing with
the times; they cherish their inde»
pendence,

Various ‘.\Ilswers' Given

The Grinncll women crave atten-
tion irom the masculine sex, which
is indiiterent to the feminine appeals.
When asked why the "no date" pol-
icy exists at Grinnell about as many
reasons are given as there are ques-
tions asked and among the answers
are: The men are financially unable
to date because so many are helping
put themselves through school. Cars
are tahcoed and the men reiuse to
“neck" on the chapel steps. The men
have more money this year and cone
sequently take their weekends out of
town. This is the situation—incon-
sistent and pathetic.

The "double standard" at Grinnell
(which apparently exists because all
of the rules are imposed upon the
women) isn’t all it has been in the
past and by such strict rules the
women cannot make themselves all
that the men expect.

There they have a social life and
the men retuse to take advantage of
it, while here at Penn the men are
aching to take advantage oi a social
lite that is not provided them. The
Grinnellians complain that about one»
halt as many attend the varsity
dances as compared with last year,
while the Pennites complain that
twice as many want to dance as com»
pared with last year, hut they have
no place on the campus to "trip that
light iantastic tile.”

And so iar into the year——

"The music or Hungary is the

“It is interesting to watch them

Mr. Lightbody observed. "They still
