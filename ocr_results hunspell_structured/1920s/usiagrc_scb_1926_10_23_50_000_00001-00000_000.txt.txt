Giosing Winks lli Woman’s
Snails Mark Glad Season

The closing weeks of women's fall
sports will mark the complQion of a
very satisfactory Season. according to
Miss Harriet Koglin, instructor of
physical education for women, who
has had general direction of fall ac-
tlvlties. The recent period of fair
weather has sped up the outdoor work
considerably and made any extension
of the season unnecessary.

Both beginning and advanced hockcy
classes have made good progress.
Hockey coats are being worn by the
different teams this your, and the ap-
pearance of the red and green jackets
on the field has made the games a
Ealortul spectacle. Volleyball has al-
so been a popular sport. The fresh-
man team has worked up well and the
advanced volleyball class has display-
cd pop and ability.

The first round of the doubles ten-
nis tournament will be played off next
weck. While the number of entries is
not large, the games'urc sure to be
followed with interest because of the
talent that will be displayed. Eliza.-
beth Wilson, present holder of the
singles championship, and Corinne
Schwarz, runner-up, are among those
entered.

Bicyclers and hikers have been tak-‘
ing advantage of the favorable weath-
er. Great enthusiasm has been Shown
by the girls who are taking hoi chuck
riding, and it is planned to sire a
short riding exhibition at the end of
lhe season.

MA E CHANGE IN
ITERARY PRIZE

Hilary York Steiner Prize to Apply
For All Literary Work.

The Henry York Steiner prize will
be given this year for any form of lit-
erary production published or unpub-
lished. This is it new departure made
by the committee in charge of the
prize, as is also the demand that all
material must be in the hands of the
committee one week before spring
vacation. It is probable that Grinnell
songs will also be eligible material
for the prize

This new ruling admits or it larger
scope of material than helm-c, as the
pri , has been glVCu previous ‘ only
[or drama, short story and verse.
Published material is to be admitted
this year because oi the feeling that
brinnell publications might be handl-
capped in gatting‘nia‘tel ll.

The prize amounted to Sixty-dollars,
the income from a fund 01‘ $1,000 given
in 1012, by Dr, and Mrs. E. A. Steiner,
as a. memorial to their Son, Henry
Yorli. The purpose of the prize is to
stimulate creative writing. No awards
were made last year as So little matera
ial was handed in and was so late in
being brought before the committee.

They have become tired of trailing
in the football standings in the Mis-
souri Vallejo loop, down in St. Louis,
and with the changing of their nick-
name from “Pikcrs” to “Bears" they
have decided to lire up to their new
coguomau, and local fans may well ex—
pect them to do just that, this after-
noon.

Sport critics differ over the outcome

an extremely close margin. The Pins
neel's of this week are different] from
the team that had difficulty in hbldihg
limes. A littio over-confidence per-
haps, and it rejuvenated Aggie team
upset the dope but Mike's lashings
the last Week have eliminated all that,
and Grihnell followers this afternoon
will see a team that will be aggressive
from the starting whistle.

Given a dry field, which early today
seemed a remote possibility, like game
should he open, with Grinnell resort—
ing to the aerial attack to score, since
the forward walls of both teams are
comparatively equal. The passing ct-
tack proved the most effective offense
last week, and it is a Safe bet that the
Lamb to Rineturt combination will be
called into play this afternoon.

Dilly one change is expected in the
lineup of the red jerseyed team, and
that will probably be Evahn in the
place of l-lughic nchain at left half.
The former is a likely lad who runs
all over the field, goes through the
line like an eel alter a perch, and in
addition is capable of relieving “Dop-
ey" Lamb of some of the passing.
Stolts is still on the sidelines, and he
will he missed as he was in last
week's game. There is a possib ty
that he m-y be in uniform, but it is
not likely that the coaches will risk
using him. ,
