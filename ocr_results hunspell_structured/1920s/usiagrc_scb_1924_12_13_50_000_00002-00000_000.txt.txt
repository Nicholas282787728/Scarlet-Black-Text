my 1mm BASEBALL?

Now thut Grinnell is fast becoming
a respected me in Missouri Valley ath—
letics, the question arises, "Why does—
n’t Grinnell add baseball as a mayor
mart?

The iaculty athletic committee has
passed a resolution recommending
that baseball be reinstated at Grins
nell at such a time as conditions and
finances shall permit, hot ityet re-
mains tor the student’bmiy, and espec<
to show that they have
enough interest in baseball at Grill-

ii-llly the men,

hell, to have it re-instated. ‘

There are several reasons why it
would be advantageous to have a Pior
neer varsity baseball team. The school
is now large enough to support both
a baseball and track team in the same
season without injuring the high ratv
ing of the Griunell cinder path men,

and it would add to Grinnell’s rating

. , l
have four maior sports instead oi

three.

Furthermore. thereare many high
school stars in both Ioothall and has
kethall who do not come to Grinnoll,
because they are also baseball players,
and are desirous ol playing intercol-
lcgiate baseball, and ii the sport were
added it might aid materially in get-
ting athletes in other sports to choose
Grinnell as their college.

in addition, it Grillliell should put a
varsity baseball team on the hold,
it would he a great help to Missouri
Valley baseball as a whole. As it is
now, Anles is the only Valley school
in the state that supports a baseball
and the southern schools in the
conference are hesitant about making

nine,

such a. long trip for only one of two
games with just one school, but it they
could play two schools on the same
trip,

tlon.

it would be a diilerent proposi-

lt is sometimes argued that Grin-
nell is too far north, and that the
climate is too cold for baseball to be is
success. But is that exactly true? If
schools as tar north as the Universi—
ties of Minnesota and Wisconsin can
support successful diamond teams,
why cant Grinnell, several hundred

miles further south, have as long, if

not longer, baseball season?

What do you think about it?
are many good baseball players

There
in
school now, and it you want the na-
tional game’here at Grinnell, now is
the time to push it. Talk it up, find
out the consensus or opinion, and it
you want it, work for it.

A LITTLE BERLIN-DER

The Christmas vacation begins late
this year, and by the time most of us
get home, there will be only three
shopping days left. Consequently,
those Christmas presents for the fam—
ily and [ricntls will have to be Dill“
chased before long.

After we get home, the time will he

so short. and the merchants’ stock so

 

in the Missouri Vallhy conference to

limited that in nine chances out of

ten we will not be able OD get What
We wanL

There is only a week left, why not,
as far as possible, buy what gifts we

have not already purchased, here in

Grinnell? The merchants here have

always loyally supported our school in
all our activities, and it would only be
proper that we patronize them a little
during the Christmas season.

Make a note or it. Buy that Christ-

STANDARDS FIRST!

ls a school to be judged by its loot-
ball teams and its Glee clubs, or shall
its reputation as an educational insti-
tution rest on the high standards ad—
‘hered to scbolasticaiiy speaking?

it has always been the policy of the
University of Oklahoma to have school
standards iirst and outside activities
second. To keep students from miss
ing the main issue in college. rules
were enacted providing that the stil—
dent must pass in at least 12 hours
of his work the previous semester to be
eligible to participate in any term or
student activity,

This has meant that talented stu-
,dents were otten eliminated from val“
‘ious activities while the activi es
might really have fared better with
them, even though they are flunkers.
Those who have ability otten appear
most indifferent to regulations and
when they are not allowed to partial»
pate in activities they feel they have
been sorely mistreated.

The student‘who has been warned
,to make up liefi enoics should not

‘expeet to receive sympathy or leniency.

from authorities when he fails to do
so.

lt all resolves into the question:
Does the student come to college to
learn to sing bass. to tackle on the
gridiron or might there be some other
reason tor his being here?
