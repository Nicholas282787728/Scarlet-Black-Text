War Is Next Step In Civilization:

(Editor’s note); Henry 0
anne of the Des itoincs Regise
istchI‘l'ibuna editorial staff
interviewed Raymond Robbins
for the Grinllell Scar-let and
Black on the subject of out-
lawry of war. Rarmond Rob-
bins is illtelllalionztlly known
as a social service expert,
lecturer and politician.

(By Henry Ozrtlllle)

“Tell the college students that the
great issue today before the nations
of the earth is the abolition oi the
institution of War," said Raymond
Robbins, social service expert, perm-
anent chairman ol' the Progressive na-
tional convention in laid, lieutenant
colonel in the United States forces
with the Red Cross commission, unof—
ficial representative or this goverm
merit to Russia in 1917, world travel-
er and lecturer,

“Sirty years ago the great issue
before mankind was the abolition of
slavery; thirty years ago it ,was the
abolition oi the saloon. Now it is
the abolition of war." It had been
nearly s ars since he has said the
same words to me, under different
circumstances, and in a dlrlerent part
of the world; but during that time, I
saw, his crusade against “Wholesale
sucicide" had lost none of its edge or
its enthusiasm.

“The last :war has left the nations
of Europe bankrupt, victor-s as well
as vanquished. War has become
national and international suicide.

"The war system is the arch mur~
der-er or the youth of the nations; the
poison in the cup or brother-hood her
tween the peoples or the earth; the
forerunner of pestilence and taminine;
the paralysis of industry; and the
suicide of commerce—the great com-
rnorl oppressor and menice of the hit»
man race, cruciiyiug Christ atresh on
every battlefield.

“War is the product of a legal sys-
tem. The war institution today is
just as legal as niariage, or the
church or the school, We tax our»
selves heavily to prepare tor wa ;
diplomats expect and plan for war;
matcrialists seek par, and honor and
fame wait on the exercise of the my
stitution of war.

"Wllat, then, is the answer? We can

outlaw War and substitute for it law.‘

Human society has overgrown other
powerful legal institutions that had
grown to he a menace to human \velr
fare, piracy, the international slave
trade, the code duello, the slave sys
tem and the liquor traffic.

"The war system must be outlawed
by international agreement; it must
be made a crime under the law of
nations. Some ol’us are demanding
the modification of international law
to provide for the legal settlement of
all international disputes, and
codification on the principles
equality in justice, and right between
all nations. And then the next step
in the abolition or war is the estab»
lishment of an international tribunal

with allirmzttive jurisdiction under a]

definite international code to hear
and determine all questions that arise
between nations and that are not set-
tled by conference or arbitration.
"Bring this informed public opinion
for the outlau’l‘y of war to bear upon
those officials with power in govern-
ment to provide and submit to the
