Student Managers

Plan to Have Manager for Spring,
Winter and Fall Sports
For Coming Year.

' Starting this Hill, A new system for
determining Student athletic managers
is being inaugurated, in as much as
candidates for the positions are to be
selected following a two Year’s ap-
prcnticcship.

Under the old System, three HIGH
were selected who were to act ‘as arr
sistants to the Senior student malr
agers during ‘the extent or their junior
year. The senior manager held his
position for all sports, and gained a
membership in the Honor G club. This
manager was seleuted from among the
Lhree junior candidates.

ior managers are to be selected ior
each iall, winter, and spring sport
respectively. Furthermore, in order
to become a candidate tor any or these
three positions, a man must start serv-
ing apprenticeship in his sophomoic
year. There are sophomore t 'onts
[or sports in each or the three Seth
soils. At the end at the sophcromu
year, three or the tryonters are se-
lected to continue apprenticeship
throughout the unior year. At. the
end ui that year, they automatically
become senior student managers.

To Accompany Teams.

The student managers will accomr
p’any their respective tennis on all
trips as was the custom under the old
regime, Honor G sweaters will also
be awarded the managers; but they
will not he oiiiciai members or the

Leland Clifford for spring. Next
year’s junior managers will be select-
ed from the six sophomores, Leonard

thus far been selected. Tile other four
will be chosen in the near future. 1
