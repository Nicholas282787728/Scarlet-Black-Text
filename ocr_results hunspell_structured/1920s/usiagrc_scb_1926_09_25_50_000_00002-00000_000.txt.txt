to see out for practice and who have
no excuse [or not being there.

“Why. when l couched a little

300 men in'the sclluol,“ he went on.
"Here with at least six times that

Traci: Men Don‘t Respond,

Aversion to athletics is not con-
ltined to so—colled football men, ac-
cording to the other couches, Dr. H.
l. l-lurt, head coach at track. who s~
sued a cross-country call more than
a week ago, said today that only 30
men had responded, “including fresh-
men, ineligibles and cripples.” “There
should be at least 300 men out for

"I know there are many men \who
are capable of at least trying ror this
sport who are not physically built

tlicting activities. -

“it is a rellection noon the student
body as a whole when such a con-

complish anything by talking to the
men who are out, tor they are the.
ones who don't need the talking to.
We want to appeal to w at spirit may
be left in the University that we may
have some interest in sport."

The small number or sport cunr
dldatcs in all lines has been a genue
ine surprise to the athletic depart—
men which has developed a coaching
stall/capable or training large inun-
bers ol athletes just at the time when
spirit seems to be waning. Some have
blamed the disinterest, in athletics,
especially tootball. on the fact ‘Lhttl.
