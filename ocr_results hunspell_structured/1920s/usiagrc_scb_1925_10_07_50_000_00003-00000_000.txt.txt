“ll'lldt is mini?" This question, age
old and still unanswered, Wits made
the subject of Tuesday’s chapel talk
by Rev. H. C. Rice, pastor of the First
Bftntist church.

Quoting from the October “Forum,"
Rev. Rice presented an interesting
theory of the origin or the universe
and of all organic life. He dealt with
the possibil y of chemical research
creating life, saving that authorities
predicted that living organisms might
someday be produced chemically trom
water, prussic neid, and carbon Inolle
oxide.

The creative principle is the Llominr
ating influence of man’s life. Man
has asserted himself in all fields.
There is :t possibility that the process
of creating organic life may lie di ~

V covered. "The discovery or this pr
tees," Rev. Rice asserted, “will make
tan. God all the greater and man all the

more dignified."
