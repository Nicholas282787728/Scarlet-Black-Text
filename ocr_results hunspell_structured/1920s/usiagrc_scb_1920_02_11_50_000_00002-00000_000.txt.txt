said Protessor F. H. Giddings in the:

He went on to point out that this
‘ doctrine has been the cause of ‘much

The College class room contains a

for the most part, all the same.

The result is that if the Professor
sets the pace for the lowest grade
of thinkers, the more capable mem—
hem of his class allure at the restraint
which is forced upon them. They
are justiﬁed in feeling that their \ime
is being wasted.

0n the other hand, it the pace is
set for the more advanced thinkers,
the others will he leit hopelessly be-

A middle course, instead of proving
satisiaetory to both groups, satisfies
neither.

i There are three arguments generally
quoted against inter-collegiate has -
ball. These are (1) The multiplicity
of sports in the spring, among which
are track, tennis, spring foothall, and
rowing (in eastern schools); (2) The
short period in which the game can
be played. due to the summer voca-
ltion; (a) The prevelcnce or liaschdll
as a professional, semi—professional
and amateur sport throughout the
country.

The above arguments are so ohvious
.that they need not he considered. In
addition to these. there are several
purely locul reasons why Grinnell
should not r cstshlish haseliall this
spring. Grinnell is by for the smallest
school, in regard to enrollment, in the
conference. Every one of our rivals
‘has an enrollment at least twice as:
.large as Grinnell's, and two or three
have three and four times the number
of students Grinncll has. These lar—
ger schools are able to support three
or four spring sports to a certain de-
gree of excellence. But if Grinncll is
to turn out athletic teams of the qual-
ity of past years, her energies must
