The purpose of the contest is in
no manner to take the place of the

lvice medals. in that contest it is the
urposc to elect the four seniors who
have done the most for Grinnell dur-

'purpose of the newly inaugurated plan
is to elect the one man and the on‘e
woman in the junior class who best
represent the ideals of Grinncii. in
voting the junior should consider in-
tellectuality, social leadership, per-
sonality, and the enthusiasm and
1ability the student has shown in ens

‘ chool. The degree to which the stu-
ident has taken part in any activity
should he considered as well as the
number and variety of the activities.

ldraft of a new system at the next

‘timc to work out the new system.
,The Lantern will probably present a
lconstitution as a mass meeting of all
‘the men in the school as soon as the
system is Worked out to the satisfac—
tion of thhe organization itself. The
‘lautcrn is composed of the leading
representatives of all men's organi--
lzations on the campus, and it was
thought that, as an organization most
nearly represenmtive of student opin-
ion, it would be the best one to start

Open Court System.

At its meeting Wednesday the loan-
tern was unanimously in favor of an
,opeu court, of some irind to take the
place of the' present Oracle. The con-
,census of opinion was that the,pre—
‘sent men's senate should remain cs-
‘senually in its present form. acting
ids a legislative body, with the open
‘oourt as the executive and judicial
, branch or the system. Such a sys-
tem will probably be the one embodi-
ed in the new constitution. If the
constitution as drawn up does not
lmeet with the approval of the stu-
dents it will be changed in any way
to suit them.

It is thought that l! the open court
is to be one of the features or the
-uew system. this court should be g1 .
en wide authority. not confining )-
self merely to the enforcement of
men’s legislation. This, however, is a
matter of question. It is also thought
that the court should be given power
to meet in closed or secret sessions
as well as open at its 'own discretion.
,These were the opinions expressed in
the Lantern meeting Wednesday. It
Tis expected that the new constitution
will be ready for presentation within
the next ten days.
