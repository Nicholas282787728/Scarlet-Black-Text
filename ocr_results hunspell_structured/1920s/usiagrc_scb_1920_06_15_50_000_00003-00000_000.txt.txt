Education Menus Progress

James Bryce said ‘The seats of
learning and education are at present
among the most potent forces making
for progress and the foundations oi

rThey incl ease daily in the excellence
.of their teachers. no less than in the
‘nulnhcr of their stutlcnts.’ This is
potently true today. but it, rs inricli to
be feared that with all this excellence
there has been a lack of appreciation
of those political ideals of individuab
ism which should be ever present as
the distinguishing mark of an Anglo-
Saxon people. German social and 9007
riornic theories have been and are her
‘ing‘ taught. A Wave of sudden ficti-
,tious prosperity has brought class
‘colisciousness and class distinctions.
the lofty cmotiolialism which marked
our entrance into the war has gilen
way to selfishness Oul' pol cal
leaders are more than ever swayed
by public opinion instead'of seeking
courageously to direct it. Technically
‘\Ve are in a state of war, and props:
iations for a great political conflict

siicb a stage of public afra , you are
'corning to take your parts in the

which finds its sanction in belief in
the Triune God has been and remains
the only hope of the social and polit»
icul regeneration of mankind lt
‘[0ims the basis of true democracy
'lvithout it the doctrine of individual
rights falls to the ground. It is with
,thc individual that education can
‘alone bear fruit. Your own will be a
blessing to yourself anti to the coin-
munities in which your lots are cast,
,in proportion as they justify the chris—
‘tian ideal."

Following the class oration, Esther-

read the class poem, "To the Spirit

The Mantle Diation was given by
Emily Piouty. who said, "This ocea-
sion is both the announcement of a
new class which is entering and the
knell of one which is just gone. we
are celebrating today “Class Day"
which marks the beginning of the end
of our college days. We are soon to
occupy that elevated and serene po-
sition of a Grinnell alumnus—an
alumnus of an institution which has
instructed rrs, which has mother-ed
us, which has broadened our vision
and given us the noblest outlook on
life that any thing or person, without
our own self, is capable of doing. The
mantle that I am wearing today serves
as the connecting link in the unendr

from this institution. It is the expres-
sion of the Grinnell spirit which binds
all Grinnellians together,

Has Had Different life
The cla§s of 1920, which has just
added its numerals to this illustrious
gown, has experienced four years of
college life very different from those
of any preceding class, and 1 hope,
from any class that is to follow. The
normality of our-s was interrupted by
three years of dessension and unrest
between nations. Many of our class
were forced to drop from the class of
1920. while we are serving as foster-
parents to some members of former
classes, Some even had to sacrifice
the completion of their education.
One of our classmates made the our
preme sacrifice when he left college to
answer the country's call. 1» am
speaking of Lloyd Gettys who was
killed on the western front on the
fourth day of May 1918. And so, class
of 1921. on behalf of the class of 1920,
l bequeath to you this mantle. May
you realize and share in me advan-
tages of progress and discovery matte
by the classes preceding you. May
all that we have missed be yours."
The mantle was then placed upon
the shoulders of Angus McDonald, rep-
resenting the class of 1921.

Prof, H, W. Matlack spoke a few
words on his twenty-two years in See
curing his degree before he played an
original composmnu. “Prelude to a
College Holiday," in which he was as-
sisted on the piano by Irene Jasper-
and Arthur Brandenburg.

Afternoon on Uillllllus
In the afternoon the class day ex-
ercises were continued on the central
campus at four o'clock
The class history was given by Max
Egloff who reviewcd the glories and
achievements of the class from the
terrors of thorr first “General", to the
mom g of their degrees. Mary Rob-
hrns, with the aid of a Ouija. board.
foretold the future of the class or 1320,
Ill which she predicted that many
honors and achievements were still to
be obtained by the class. The last
will and testament of the class of 1sz,
leaving all of their “rights and priri-
lcscs" to the class of 1321, was read
