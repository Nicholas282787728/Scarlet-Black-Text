Non-breakable Pen Bax-rel? Dr.
F. C. Morse oi the National Park-

unconvinced.

So recently to test the ncharker
Duolold barrel. he stood on the
rim of Grand Canyon and threw
[his pen into the rock- med chasm.

When the pen was recovered
amid the jagged rocks a hall mile
below the canyon’s edge, it was
scratched a bit, bu! quire unbroken.

When the cap was removed the
point was as good as ever—a point
guaranteed for 25 years, not only
for mechanical periection but for
wear!

You cannot get Duciold quality
in any pen save that stamped
“Geo. S. Parker." Look careiully

would like you to try this classic.
