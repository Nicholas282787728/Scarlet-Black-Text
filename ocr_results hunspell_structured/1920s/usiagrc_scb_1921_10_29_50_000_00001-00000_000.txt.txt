“We owe Coe a good mud bath and

Saunders last night as he looked at
the rain beating outside on the win-
dow. At present wl- ng it surely ap-
pears that a muddy ﬁeld and a Slips
pery ball'are on the program for this
afternoon but it is to be hoped that

the contest will not turn out to be a

replica of the naval engagement stag—

ed on Coe ﬁeld last year.
Coe Takes Work Out

The Coo team arrived last night
bringing along an ample suply of sub-
stitutes. The visitors took a short
work out on Ward held but darkness
prevented'anything like an extended
practice. Coe will be considerably
weakened by the loss of Pence, star
half-back. Kline who was reported to
be out of the game is playing again
and will probably he used this after—
noon. Coe seems to be doing its nta
most to he in readiness for today's
game and we can be assured that they
will put up a real ﬁght

The Pioneers took a light drill. in
the rain which in case of a wet ﬁeld
this afternoon should help greatly in
handliny a wet ball. Whitehill is not
back in the lineup, Garner being slated
to occupy the pilot‘s position Mark—
ley is still suffering from an injured
back which will probably keep him out
of the game. His position at fullback
will be filled by Raffety who has
been showing remarkable improve—
ment lately. The spirit of the team
has been remarkably intense during
the two weeks of preparation for this
game with their old rivals and they
can be depended on to give everything
in their power to defeat the ‘Cedar

Rapids cohorts. ;

Odds Even

There has been (considerable con.
lecture as to which team will be fav-
ored in the event of a muddy ﬁeld. The .
Coe team has slightly the heavte‘r:
team but this difference is not enough
to seriously handicap the Grinnell. ,
The game will probably go to the team l
which plays straight football and fol-i
lows the ball closely. There is always
a number of fumbles in a game which
it is necessary to play with a wet'
ball. These fumbles are unavoidable
and it is the recovering of these errors '
which often spells victory or defeatl
Grinnell, in the early part (f the sea—f
son, was especially good in this branch *
of the game and it is likely that they;
will be able to put their ability in'
this line to a real test today.

The probable lineup for the game’

is:

Grinnell Coe
MacyA-L. D Wernlmont.
Miller—L T West
Schmidt—L. G.—Lamb

Eight Pioneer distance men will line

the ﬁrst Missouri Valley Cross-

is the ﬁrst meet fur both teams, and
no time is available, the done is at

dope at. hand seems in center around
Feike, Drake's Star miler of last year.
Reece defeated him in the mild by a.
narrow margin in the Drake . dual
meet last spring. In the home meet
Thursday October 20. Reece was dfth
to ﬁnish. Although the Grinn’ell mil—
er does not run his best race in the
longer grinds it looks as though Sev-
eral of the Pioneer squad should do—
ish well to the front with a strong
possibility of Daugherty and' ngley
lea/ding the ﬁeld. In all yprobability
the meet will be decided by the place
in which the fourth and fifth Pioneer
runners ﬁnish. ’ _

Jones and Taylor of Drake both
sophomores. have been touted by the

considerable ability and may be the
means of upsetting the dope.

Prof. Ryan Gives Opening Address
And Miss Farrell Speaks —
Banquet at Quad.

One hundred and thirty four dele—
gates to the second annual convention
of the Iowa High School Press Asso—
ciation, representing twenty—eight
schools, were on the campus yester-
day and today as guests of the local
chapter of sigma Delta Chi, national
journalistic fraternity, and the Wom—
en’s Press Club.

The convention which was started
for the ﬁrst time last year promises to
grow into an event of considerable
magnitude and brings to Grinnell each
year a group of the choicest of Iowa’s
young people. The program is inspir—
ing and valuable and promises much
of value and interest

Lewis Stone of Grinnell is president
of the asosciatlon. Eve. Franklin of
Newton is vice president, Glenn
Meagher of ottuntwa, is secretary and
treasurer, Cole Van Gordon of East
Des Moines, Lucia MeCornack of Sioux
City are directors and Professor D. D.
Griffith, of Grinnell College, is faculty
advisor.

The opening meeting of the assu-

clation was held Friday afternoon in

Alumni Recitation Hall, APl-of. J. P.

Ryan of the public speaking depart—

ment of the college and Miss Eliza»

beth Farrell, of Newton, were the

speakers of the afternoon, the remain—

der of the session being given over to

round table discussions for editors

and business managers, in order to

work out any problems that might be

before the various groups. Prof. D.

D. Griffith of the English department

had charge of the round table for

editors while Harry Flynn,.business

manager of the Scarlet and Black.

led the meeting for business managers.

After each high school had given.
its yell, the meeting was called to

order by Lewis Stone, the president

of the High School Association. Pro-

fessor Ryan was introduced and gave

the address of welcome. Comparing

Gl'lnnell college to the ﬁeld of lame

nalism, he said that Grinnell is es—
pecially a liberal institution as is the
public press of America, “The press

in its best and highest ideals is llb~
eral. It attempts to express the best
in the world,” he declared. In main-
taining that Grinoell stood for the
spirit of Christ and Christianity he
said, "those magazines and papers
that have longest endured have at-
tempted to put into them the spirit of
the Nazarene." The motto of the jour-
nalist, according to Professor‘Ryan,
is "Play the Game."

Miss Elizabeth Farrell, of Newton.
then spoke on "What constitutes
School News." Her deﬁnition of
school news was “any written event
that is connected with, and of inter-
est to those associated with that
School.” She then went on to enu-
merate the various columns, depart—
ments, and sections of a high school
paper and to offer suggestions as to
how they should be managed.

One committee was appointed by
President Stone at the meeting. Miss
Elizabeth Farrell was made chairman
of the nominating committee which
is to report this morning, and Miss
Jeannette Sabin of Northwood, Miss
Eleanor Chase of Clinton, M. John
St. Clair of Marshalltown, and Mr.
Clarence Jenkins of Council Bluffs
were made members of this commit—
tee. '

A banquet, for the high school dele~
gates at which the college was host,
and for the members of the local
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi and the
girls of the press club was held in
the Quadrangle dining room Friday
night at six o'clock. A brief toast
program was given with Lewis (Stone
as toastmastel- and responses by
Bruce Ashby, president of Sigma Delta
Chi, Melvin err of Eagle Grove, Mar»
garct Jones of Fort Dodge and Mr.

 

nl members, The Iowa. alumni of Slgc
n13. Delta Chi are planning this part
of the program, and they claim it will
