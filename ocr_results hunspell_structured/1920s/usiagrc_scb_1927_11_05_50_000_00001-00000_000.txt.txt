Compares White People In North
To Dam Ready to Burst and
Flow Into Region

SOUTH SMUGGLES SLAVES

Merk Declares There Is Danger
When Political Parties Are
Not National.

“The Occupation of the Gulf Plains"
was the subject of Prof. Frederick
hlel’li's fourth lecture of tlle series on
"‘The History or the West," givcn ch»
ncsdzty evening in A. R. H. auditorium.

"As early as 1810 the white popula-
tion of the United States was indicat
ing a purpose of penetrating this re-
gion, then Illdiau territory,” said Proa
lessor Mel‘k. He compared the mass
of white people in the North to a dam
ready to burst and overflow this gulf
legion. He further explained that this
territory was opened up to settlers by
the War of 1312, which Was also re-
sponsible for the upening’up of the
'Middlc West. “The Creek Indians
that occupied this region took up arms
against the incoming settlers, but two
years later the)’, Valid the‘penalty at
the hands of that grim lndian fighter.
Andrew Jackson," said the lecturer.
"In 1814 these Indians were forced to
accept a harsh peace, and by 1820," he
stated, “the Creeks had been crushed.
and the dam had burst and flooded
the Indian plains.”

Pioneers Forced Out.

Hc explained that the two arms of
great fertility, the Mississippi flood
plain and the "black belt" were occu»
pied by planters with large amounts
of capital. These planters moved in.
bringing with them picturesque trains
of slaves. They bought out the pic.
users who had cleared the land, and
established the large plantations. The
small farmers moved farther south
and west into the less desirable lands.
“These sections became the areas of
the yeoman white. or whlte dem-
oraCy," said Dr, Merk, "producing such
types as the mountain whites and the
Georgia ’crackers.”’

The lecturer stated that in order to
carry on the work of the plantation,
it was necessary to import great num-
hers of slaves. "By 1850 seventyrflye
por cont of the population in the re—
gion of the Mississippi flood plain
consisted of blacks. Negro slaves from
all the northern territory were drained
into the rich, virgin field of the gulf
plains. More African slaves were
smuggled into the South at \this time,
contrary to the law of Congress than
when the slave trade was legal."

South Carolina Suffers.

“In 1301, after the invention of the
cotton gin, cotton production became
localized in South Carolina. This was
a period of great prosperity for this
state," the speaker added. By 1311'
however, cotton planting was moving
toward the Nashville region in Tens
nesee, and by ml, South Carolina
was no longer dominant as the cotton
producer of the South. He showed that
by 1833, South Carolina had been even
more displaced, which explained her
unhappiness. Professor Merk, pointed
out, however, that South Carolina
blamed hcr distress on political rath-
er than economic causes and Dal-tlcu-
larly oh the tariff. “This accounts for
the nulliflcatlon movement of which
Calhoun was the leader," he said.

“We may expect to find that areas of
rich soil and large capital are the
sections that in politics would be con—
servative," said the lecturer. "We
may further expect," he continued,
“that these regions would he Conserva»
tive even on the question of the cxtcn.
sion of slavery. The cotton planter.
who wore the capitalists of the South,
were always eager to avoid disturb—
ances." Professor Merk pointed out
that the areas oi cotton production
voted the Whig ticket. while the poor
whites of the regions of the poorer
soils voted the Democratic ticket. ”It
is generally unknown in the North
that in the question of slave extension,
the areas of greatest slave concedin—
tlon voted for moderation While the
poor whites were radical in their
views." He explained that the reason
for this was that the poor white dis—
liked thc negro and wished to keep

was the white yeomcn's one claim to
social superiority," he sold.

Sectional Parties Dangerous

The lecturer traced the development
of the South through the period of the
great issue of expansion up to 1856,
when the slave questions reached a
critical stage in the North “The un—
ion of the anti-slave factions at this
time," he stated, "resulted in the dis-
integration of the moderate parties in
the South,"

“It is a dangerous condition," Dr.
Merk asserted, "when poi-tics ccnsc
to become national." He pointed out
at this time the North was solidly
Republican in opposition to the mill-
tant, Democratic South. “So it is,"
said Mr. Merk, "when parties bocomc
scefionallzed we are on the verge of
a civil war.”

music that she plays it back into v'lvid
life and present actuality. Her inter-

things left to perish of neglect. Her

Recreation Work
To Be Presented

Playground Representative Will
Discuss Opportunities In
Work November 17.

i .

Recreation leadership as an attract»
ive and uncrowded field for college
graduates will be described on Thurs»
day, November 17, when Maurice Wil-
lows of the Playground and Recreation
association of America visits Grinnell
college. Mr. Willows represents the
National nccreation‘School conducted
by the A, ociation in New York City.
which offers a one-year course to
about fifty College men and women
chosen for their qualities of leadership
and athletic and scholastic ability.

The forty-four students in this
year’s class Were picked from two
hundred applicants in the graduating
classes of leading colleges last June.
A few of the colleges contributing
these students are: Columbia, Vassar.
Ohio Wesleyan, Northwestern, and the
Universities of Nebraska, Miama,
Michigan, Alabama, Indiana, Pennsyl:
Vania and illinois.

Thirty-four Working.

The thirty-four members of the pio-
neer class. lust year's. are at work in
public recreation departments, coro-
munlty houses, etc,, throughout the
country.

Seven-hundredninety cities now em-
ploy 2,905 paid recreation workers the
year round, according to 1926 sta—
tistics, and the number is steadily in-
creasing, The Playground and necrc-
ation association of America opened
Its school because of the demand up-
on its personnel department for a high
type of recreation leader and the in!
adequate supply of trained workers.

Practice and demonstration. rather
than theory, is the school's method,
Athletics, social recreation. commonv
ity music. community drama, handl—
craft, folk danclng, nature study.
camping, boys’ and girls' clubs, home
recreation, community centers, prob.
lems of finance and publicity, and
school recreation are some of the prlns
clple subjects in the curriculum.

Faculty Well Known.

The faculty has been drawn from
universities and city recreation dc-
partments in many states and includ-
es: Jay E. Nash, associate professor
of physical education, New York uni-
versity: Prolcssor Alfred G. Arvold of
North Dakota Agricultural college. the
founder of the famous "Little Country
Tllezttref’ Peter W. Dykema, professor

ica; -" William Bllrdick, M. D. director
of the playground Athletic league,
Baltimore: Anne Carroll Moore, New
York State college of forestry; and
other well known lenders in the field
of leisure time activities.

Arrangements may be made for the
students to corn part, in some in-
stances all, of their living expenses
and at the same tlme gain experience
through part-time work in New York
City.

Salaries in recreation work range
from $1,200 to $6,500 a year, a recent
survey shelved. Thc lower salaries
are for assistants in the recreation
Centers and playgrounds, the highest

Watt Says Though Locals Are Not

Surprise Badgers.

THREE REGULARS 0N BENCH

Parish, Rose and Cleland Have
Injuries to Prevent Them
Playing Today.

Thursday evening twenty-three Plo-
neer grid warriors departed for Maili-
son, Wisconsin, when: they meet the
University of “liscnnsin football team
this afternoon at Camp Randall. Coach
L. L. lettt expressed the opinion this
afternoon that althouch the Pioneers
are conceded no Chance of stopping
the Badgers, they Would Surprise the
Wisconsin team in the matter of dc-
fensive lllily, if not of offensive.

Three of the regular Grinnell resu—
lars are almost certain to be on the
bench this afternoon, and one-member
was not taken on the trip. Ray. Cle-
land, husky guard, received a badly
Wrenched shoulder in the Marquette
game last Week, and has been unable
to report for practice this Week. His
loss is an especially hard blow to the
Pioneer hopes. as the husky guard has
been one of the mainstays in the line
this season. His place will Proh-
ably he filled by Heldridge or Bradley,
depending on which of these two is
used at center

Lineup Almost Slime.

Parish has been suffering from It
badly sprained wrist, and unless an
unusually rapid improvement has take
on place. will probably see very little
action. Harold Rose, regular full-
back, and one of the outstanding stars
of the Marquette game has been kept-
from active practice for most of the
week, and it is feared that even in case
he docs break into the lineup, he will
not be available for a long DBTlod. Aside
lrom these three, the lineups used in
other games remains intact.

The declaration of Jack Loek‘s eligi.
hility yesterday solves a serious prob-
lem, as it provides a strong substitute
for Rose, or, it needed, another end.
Locke is one of the hardest tackling
members of the squad, and has been
used defensively by Watt at both full-
back and end. As shall carrier the
husky utility man is one of the lastest,
and best plungers on the squad. and
will no doubt see action as the hall
tater this afternoon.

Evalm Kicks Well.

Ernest Mclntirc will again he of the
signal calling berth, and will he
ﬂanked by Liedtke and Evahn at the
halves. Evahu has been keeping his
kicking leg in shape all week, and
should give a classy exhibition of the
puntlng pastime today. Wednesday
evening, Evahn averaged well over
fifty yards in a punting drill. and was
placing the majority of his attempts
outside in' the neighborhood of the ten
Yard line.

A strong forward passing attack will
probably be instituted by the Watt men
this afternoon, but they will flnd an
alert defense in the Wisconsin backs.
