tinues to run a strong race, with the
finish mark in sight.

Like all good exhibitions, this pare
‘ticular circus started the ball rolling
with a spectacular display of floats,
the like or which was never before
seen west of the Mississippi. It was
a variegated ensemble which fell in
behind the college band when the
procession formed in iroiit of Geode

model of Dante's Inierno, featuring
the iaculty, court and other popular

engaged in a perambulating juvenile
party, which proved to be an appro-
priate setting tor the participants.
The fertile brains of Building Three,
presumably in collaboration with Mar-
tha Cleveland Cottage, succeeded ‘in
devising two floats, of a contrasting
nature, The scene of the first was
laid in a schoolrooni and that of the
second in the clubroom of Building
Three. ‘Nuff sed. With true pioneer
instinct, Building Four and Cottage
Three portrayed the rigors of a hardy
settler's journey into new country
with his faini - and belongings. To an
unprejudiced outsider it seemed that
the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Annuals w s passing up a
fine opportunity for action. Clark hall

In his Thursday morning's speech,

Professor Rose said that although Na.» .

poleon was a Mime, yet "He was the
greatest hustler in a world of inter
est and one trembles to think what
might have happened it he had had
Henry Ford as a right hand mini."

The noted Englishman took up b-a-
poleons life and stated the most im—
portant iniliiences upon it, as well as
Napoleon's influence upon his own
and ioi-eign countries and literature.
lie spoke of his military campaigns
as being the most brilliant of all
times, and later on in his speech con»
trusted the fighting of that day with
that oi the present where, because of
the diificulty in handling large mass-
es, war has been placed in the hands
oi a committee.

Summing up Napoleon he said that
he failed because he undertook too
much. "Allllough he figures as a
great invigoiator upon the material
side of human liic, vet on the higher
side, his influence w s null and pos»
itivcly harmful."
