Gl'innell College has been without a

the school the credit in this
field of activity that

out during the past three months.

the hand financially. Financial
help is probably the most essential of
our needs. But we can overcome even
this dilliculty, with the right kind of
assistance. The nrnhlem has come to
a crisis, and under 'the existing condi—
tions, the studcnt body must decide
whether Grinnell is going to have a
hand that IS it hand, or not.

If one out of every ten Who read

these lines could have been in the

'\\rritel"s piece at the game at Ames re-

cently, and could have experienced
the wl'itel’s feelings when the Ames
band marched on the field, Gl'innell

would have n luunl. Then: is no ques—
tion in my mind as to this hict. Think
oi our representation there, twenty
men, arrayed against an organization
just three times as large. Think or
the difference just in appearance nnd
volume, How would you who rend
this have felt, bad you heen one or
the Grinneil band men then? Would-

': n't you have felt ashamed? Wouldn‘

you have experienced a sinking sen-
sittiorl, somewhere in that old hulk of
yours? Can you blame the lelloivs
who are capable of playing an instru—
ment tor losing their interest, when

they are subjected to such situations.

simply because they haven't the slin-
port and backing of the college?

We who hnve been working against
these uilliculties feel that we have

.‘hut must have, the support of every

student, especially under the existing
circumstances.

One more paint. The band, in past

‘ done all that we can to make the baudiyears. has come to be looked upon as

a success. From now on the EllCOESS

[of the student body. Do not misun-
del'stand us. We are not passing the
buck. We are still willing and sun-
‘ ions to put forth every oliort to make
the thing GO, but we can do nothing

{without the support and help of the

‘stlldent body. The hand is primarily
a neprcreating organization, and we

i feel that, as such, it not only deserves

A'nd it is still looked
upon by the majority of students as a
more or less or a humorous ,nttolr.
Until that idea is changed, and there
is a. general realization that the bond

build up a hand that IS a band is any-
thing hut a: joke, there never can and
never will be a college band that can
