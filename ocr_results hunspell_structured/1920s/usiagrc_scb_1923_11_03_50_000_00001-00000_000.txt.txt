doepest penetration of the freshman
defense was to the in yard line and
was the only occasion when the trash

Conclave of Iowa High School
Journalists Sponsored by
Sigma Delta Chi.

Plans for the annual lowa High‘
School Press convention which will he
held in Grinnell November 16 and 17
are rapidly whipping into final form
under the direction of a committee
from the local chapter of Sigma. Delta
Chi. Speakers of the highest type
from various Iowa newspapers, buss
iness houses and schools of journab
ism have been invited to attend the
convention and address the high
school journalists. A special feature
of the program will be the emphasis
laid on journalism as a profession for
those who have had some experience
and would like to know more about
possibilities for remaining permanent-
l)‘ in that field of work.

Another part of the program which
should prove of interest to the visit-
ing delegates will be round table dASA
cussions which will be open to all delv
egatcs and will give each one a
chance to express his own questions
and views and profit by exchanging
his ideas with those confronted by
similar problems. One division of
these round table discussions will be
under the super-vision of the We-
men's Press Club, and will be
confined mainly to a discussion of
the woman's page, society columns
and matters of a similar nature.

Entertainment I’lmmetl

unite in Grinnell the delegates will
be guests of the college and board,
room and entertainment will be furn-
ished without charge to the entire
number of the delegates. Entertain-
ment will be in the form of a conven—
tiun banquet, a recital course Violin
recital, the Coe-Grinnell football
game, an informal dance, and the
presentation of three short plays by
the dramatic production class.

Sigma Delta Chi is planning all the
details of the convention but the Wc~
men’s Press club will aid especially
in the plans for entertainment.

whose birthdays occur in September,
October. and November celebrated to-

Ten tables at the north end of the

Hztllmve'eu favors of candy witches

Plans are under way for a series of
these birthday dinners, so that every
one may be included. Mary Hewitt

SHOULD HANG

PORTRAIT OF COLLEGE CENTRA

IN HALL OF FAME

 

“l-lcllozl Did my buzzer ring? Oh,
was that the lunchbell.7Do we have
new table assignments today? say.
what time is the rec hour tonight, do
you hnowl"

Every nation has its scholars,
statesmen, interpreters, mechanics
and workmen, but as a combination
of all these types and qualities, we
nominate for the Hall of Fame, "Col-
lege Central”.

For if she can keep a dozen calls
going at once, straighten out a mi -uP
of names, summon the hungry mob at
meal time, blink thc lights at ten
thirty, be a human encyclopedia and
information bureau combined and at
the same time keep a Golden Rule disc
position, we vote that an extra heavy
frame enclose her portrait in its new
place or honor.

Furthermore, it is a difficult task
for the switchboard operator to regard
mankind as possessing any qualities
of sanity from the types of stunts
which they all attempt. Shc smiles
yet as she remembers the prep who.
calling Miss Brown, and being asked
“which one" (of six), could not recall
the first name and replied that any

' ‘3.
'ollo would do. Likewise there is the

freshman girl who merely gives ceu~
ml the name of a gentleman friend
and expects to hear his voice at the
end of the line in a second or two.
,not wishing to bother town central or
waste time hunting a building nonie
her!

A collection should be taken to fit
the telephone olfice with infallible
clocks, Encycloyaodia Britannica, and
files for all bits of campus informa-
tion and schedules; for college central
must of course be ready to answer
questions as to time, weather and the
name of the speaker at Vespers. Col-
llege central should have an extra pair
of hands to take care of the long list
of feminine names to he called at sev—
en-forty-five of an evening, in short
enough time to send the patient call-
ers on their way to the dance with un-
ruffled dispositions.

Besides all these super-human char-
acteristics, qualification number 4867
is that College Central must be able
to assume the role of ouadite Con~
soler when the regular Sunday morn-
ing special fails to make its appear-
once!

 

 

SIXlY-SEVEA MEN Bll]
IN SﬂSlElﬁLESTIﬂNS

Bids Turned Over .to Debutingi
Union Which Will Announce
Results Wednesday.

The iii-st step in the elections of
the Men's Literary societies was taken
last Wednesday night when the sev—
eral societies made their bids for newl
members. Sixtyvseven men were bid'
from four societies. Each society
|bid between twenty-five and thirty
'men, many duplicates arising from
the fact that each society is able to
bid anyone whom it desires.

After the elections in the business
meetings of the several societies, the.
results were handed over to the De—
bating Union which in turn, notified
each man who had received a bid and
asked that he return a list of the SOA
cietics graded in the order of his prev
fereuce. At a meeting of the Union
Monday night, these lists will he toll»
on up and each man assigned to the
society, highest in his list, that hasr
bid for him. The new men
will then be informed to what society
they have been elected in the Scar—
let and Black for Wednesday.

This is the second year that thel
present system has been in use in so
Ciety elections. The object is to givel
each new man a chance to select his
society without being rushed too much
by one society to ‘tbc exclusion of any
other. Absolute silence is maintain-
ed by the various society members
from the beginning ofschool until after-
final results of the elections have been
announced by the Debating Union.

This is a powerful drama ofthe
sweat shops at slack season. Hard as
it is for anthing lovely to prosper
in such an environment a path—
etic little romance finds its start.

Under the direction of Paul Clovis,
the play will soon be rounded into
shape. Kreymborg's fantasy "Mal-i—
kin and Minlkin,“ and the light com-
edy "Wurzel mummory," by Alan Mll-
no, the other playlets on the bill, are

r NEWEHNANSE PLANS

Finance Committee Contehlplotes
stricter Supervision of Dr-
ganization Accounts.

The finance committee or the Stud»
ent council is working on a plan to
force each student organization to
keep a complete set of books and to
make perodic reports to the council
of the exact state of its finances.
This is under-stood to involve closer
supervlsion of organization finance
than already exists through the sems
ester reports to the CounciL

The purpose of the contemplated
scheme is to prevent organizations I
from accumulating indebtedness and
carrying it from year to year at the
expense of the local merchants. It
is designed according to the commit—
tee to keep organization finance in
a healthy condition and to insure or~
sanization creditors against loss.

No decision has yet been reached
as to the details of this plan by the
committee, but it will be presented to
the council within a short time for
rejection or acceptance.

Open Date Gives Elward Chance
To Send His Men Through
strenuous Workouts.

With an open date this afternoon on
the Scarlet and Black schedule, the
Pioneers have been put through d
series of strenuous workouts ill lire—
pal-ation for the Kansas Aggie game,
which will be played here on Nov.
10.

The Pioneers came through the game
with Drake without serious mishap,
the only injury being received by
Wood. He came out of the tangle
with a pair of bad ankles and a clip-
Died knee.

Realizing the weakness of thc team
on fundamentals, coach Elward has
been sending his men through scrim-
mage every afternoon this week in an
effort to correct that deficiency. The
scrirnmages have been somewhat cost-
ly, for a number of men have re»
coived slight injuries which will pre—
vent them from participating in scrim—
mage for several days. Because
of woods injury, Duke has been
playing left tackle. Jones, who
made such a good showing in the
Drake contest, has been tried at quar-
terback and mu probably get a chance‘
to show his ability at that position
in the next game.

The men realize that they will have
a hard game with the Kansas Aggies,
who played the last Ames eleven to
a tie several weeks ago. It is ex-
pected that this Week's scrimmage
and the practices next week will make
a great improvement in the team, and
that it will he prepared to give 5.
