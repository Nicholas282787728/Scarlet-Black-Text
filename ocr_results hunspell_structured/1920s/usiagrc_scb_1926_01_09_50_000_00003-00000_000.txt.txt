Says IIL‘ Thinks High Gmileh Are Not
n I Of Two Scllolm'ship.

(New student)

What are grades worth? An "A"
student at the University oi Kansas
doesn't think they are marks of true
scholarship. When oriered member
ship in Phi Beta Kappa, he wrote this
ieIusiil:

Kansas Alpha Chapter or Phi Beta
Kappa:

I wrote this letter with hesitating
imgers, tearing that 1 may not makc

“1°” “‘5" “W I ‘9“ “1“” I 5‘“ I “m : only system on which our civilization

declining the honor of membership in
Phi Beta Kappa. I appreciate deeply

the honor that has been extended to-

me. My reasons tor not accepting it
are presented in the iollowing para-
graphs.

I do do Ilot'subscribe to the ideal oi
the high grade which I under-stand is
the ideal of Phi Beta Kappa. I hon-
estly believe that in the circumstances
or our state universities today, with
their large classes and individualized
treatment, to strive for grades is
detrimental to the best interests of
scholarship, To get an “A" requires
a degree ,of docility and useless in—
dustry that is fatal to the independ-
ence, initiative, and spirit oi advens
ture which are the very iiie blood, it
seems to me, or the true scholar and
scientisL

In short, I feel that the grade sys-
tem of our schools is a (also criterion
of scholarship and is a dangerous
foundation tor intellectual idealism
and achievement.

I recall, as I write, my own exper-
ience with grades, for I sadly admit
that many of the “A’s" came through
the path of “grinding," "cramming,“
"doing what the 'prof' expects," and
“working for grades." I feel that I
have sacrificed my own development
tor the empty honor ot a grade. I feel
that this is the price oi our honoring
of high grades. or course if high
grades, and high scholarship were
synonymous there would be no point
in what I say. But in our academic
system where so much of the educa-
tional process is iiirmal I do not see
how it is possible for a student to he
“straight A man" without wasting
much of his energies on the forms and
husks which are inevitable in courses
which are taught, not to individuals,
but to classes or 30, 50, 100 and 150.

. . . I do not believe that I would be
honest and fair to the organization if
I joined it when I have so little con-
fidence in the efficiency or its high
grade measure oi scholarship ( I do
not agree with those who say “Well, it
is the best we can have under the
circumstances"). I do not see that it
would be playing square with the
scholastic standards of Phi Beta Kap-
pa if I accepted member-ship upon the
basis oi my past records and then pro-
ceeded to ignore, as I am trying to do,

Work is now under way for the tuo

and a play by Roma Kzluflmnn as yet

by the Experimental theatre.

The second play was worked out in
the playrwritlllg class, and is based
somewhat on a short story by James
Branch Calrcll. It is a story or
E .abethan lite, dated 1593, and deals
with a luxuriouslyrlilindcd girl who
desires complete love and attention
from the man oi her choice, but to

Baseball While in Valley.

Ames along with Washington and
Nebraska has dropped baseball en-
tirely as an inter-collegiate snort.
i Ames was able to schedule but iour
games for this spring and as all or
them were with one school, Director
’1'. N. Metcali announced that Ame:
would put out no diamond team this
spring.
L Washington and Ames will not have
teams until their field houses are paid
for and as Drake and Grinnell have
‘not had teams tor some time, it
seems that baseball as a Missouri Val-
ley sport is at least temporarily on
the wane.

Increased attention to inter-class
and intramural baseball will be shown
at Ames.

Knuiiiuml Resigns from Council.

The resignation of Remit Kituiimdn
from the Student Council was formally
[accepted at its last meeting. The chuno
oil also submitted, for approval. a. llst
of recommendations to the Faculty
Board.

Two students at Boston university
had names exactly alike and such
havoc in the university records was
wrought that the registrar took the
liberty of giving them middle names.

Every Student

About Typewriters

EVERY student
knows he needs a

typewriter, but here

are four points that

are important in

choosing a machine:

1. It should be PORT-t

ABLE.

It should have the
standard, four-row
keyboard.

3. It should have 'n Willa
