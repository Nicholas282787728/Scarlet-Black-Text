Autumnal Beauty

 

The leaves turn saffron yellow,
gold, and flutter on the campus
down; Earth’s broad. warm bosom
they enfeltl and cover with a blanket
brown. The countryside is ﬁlled with
pride and proudly sports its russet
gown. Then clear outrings the clas»
sic bell and echoes flout adown the
breeze; they fashion an illusire spell
and weave wild joys and jubilees.
Each pioneer then cocks an ear and
bachward to the campus flees.

The sailor turns him from the sen;
the hunter leaves his stream and hill;
and Maltese grads wherc'er they be,
experience an inward thrill: they
turn them back from ship and shack
to where Grinnellians rally still.
The freshmen don the latest style
and drop themselves with vesunonm

The day of days at last is here,

stands; the air is filled with cheer

Lowden Describes
Beauty of Europe

Grinnell Faculty Member Spend]
Leave In Travel Abroad.

The opportunity of ram" g Sicily,
ltaly, France and the B) ish Isles
was taken advantage of by professor
Eleanor Lowdeu of the Grinnell Eng-
lish department when she was given
a leave of absence by the college.
After having spent a most interest
ing- year abroad, Miss Lowden has
returned to Grimiell with a host of
delightful memories as mementoes
of her journey.

Her travels took her from Sicily
through Italy to the region of Lake
Geneva, then south to the Riviera
in France. A northern trip through
the French cities of old Roman our
cupation, medieval Carcassonne being
one of the most fascinating. was
greatly enjoyed and appreciated by
Miss Lowden, as was a three day
stop at Lonrds. Seven! interesting
weeks in Paris enlivened. by side
trips through the chateau and anther
dral districts terminated her stay in
France. England claimed her atten-
tion next, where she spent some
time in London and an inspiring
week at Oxford. She was in Scot/-
land during August which is the
time of year when the Scottish
heather is at its best Unfortunate—
ly. that is also the time when a

 

great many tourists are there and
Miss Lowden feels that it is difﬁ-
cult for one who truly loves Nature
to appreciate the scene amid so
many who were there simply bee
cause “it is the thing to do.” Miss
Lowden says. “The beauty of the
Scottish lakes, Katrine and Loch
Lomand, as well as that of the
trossachs and moors, amply fulfill
the dreams of Scotland one chef»
ishes from reading Scot.”
Motor Trips Delightiui

The motor trips through Franco
and Sicily Contributed one of Miss
Lowlitm’s greatest pleasures. One
of the most enjoyable was from Pa.
lcrmo to Girgenti in Sicily. This
led through the part of the country
containing the iinest remains of the
old creek temples. it particularly
lovely sight was the view that
looked toward the hill where the one
temple of Segesta stands high and
intact among the mountains, its
exquisite beauty of line visible for
many miles. Syracus and Tarominu,
two hill towns in the mountains,
look down upon the blue lonian Sea
and at snmwcovered Aetns. The
view from the Greek theatre at Taro.
mina is unusually beautiful at
Sunset.

Towns Are Mediornl
The motor trip from Ainles-Bains
to Nice, through the Alps all the
way, with fascinating glimpses of
medieval fortresses and castles in
the mountains left nothing to be
desired in the way of interest and

imagination. The towns. quaint and
secluded, seemed untouched since
medieval times,

One impression which gives rise
to thought, is the tremenduous num-
ber of Americans, especially women.
who are expatriots. Miss Lowden
suys, “In spite of ones enjoyment
of Europkits art treasures, the in-
cxprcssahle joys of the Vatican,
Uffizi. the Louvre, the galleries in
London—one is constantly perturbed
by the wonder as to what America
fuils to give her people that so many
of them are content to live permar
ncntly in foreign lands, however
entrancing.”
