Hall’s Visit Recalls Romantic Career
Of War Hero, Author and Philosopher

Tire story ol the years since James
Norman Hall wrote "Sous ot 01d
Gl'lllllell" in 1910, till when he sat in-
censnrerrously listening to it from
the bzlck ot the chapel Monday morn-
ing, rs like a tantsstic romance. Over
in the lihrary one tinds this romance
delightiuily translated into words, in
a row or honlrs—trom "KiLcllener's
Mob” in 1916 to "Mid-Pneilic” in
102s. “Sons at Old Gl'illllcll” is the
least oi the ways in which James
Norman Hall has brought honor to
his Alma Mater.

When word came to Grinncll, inst
hctore the Armistice, that his plane
had been shot down hehind German
lines. the whole college waited
breathlessly. They had tollowed him
through service with Kitchener-'s Moh
when the war iirst broke out, through
his adventures with the French flying
corps, and finally through his exploits
in the air for his own eountr -, only to
lose him, now that peace was in sight,
somewhere behind enemy lines.

l capes Pram Pri. on Camp

Morning newsnaners were rlielred
eagerly tor more deiinite news. “Shut
down hehind the lines,“ said the oese
simists, amounted to a death—sent-
tenee. Some fttoul , rremher- begged
that a memorial service he held, but
President Main held out lirmly: there
should he no memorial service until
his death was Dl‘oven.

Then. on a mor ing when even the
most optimistic were beginning to
despair, the news came iust hetore
chapel that a man giving his name as

James Norman l-lall had reached Ale
lied territory, after having made his
way through German lines from an
enemy prisoner's camp. Every voice
in the Grinnell chapel rang nut that
morning in a song to one of the
staunclrest and bravest ot them all,
