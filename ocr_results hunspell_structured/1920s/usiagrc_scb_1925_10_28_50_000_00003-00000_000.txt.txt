charm and with increased evpericnce

Bari-is imparted Vigor to his acting,
a promise at future achievement.

In the [our years during which we
have attended college dramatic Der-
iormances (several of these silent in
the role of the maligned and inisuii-
dcrstood reviewer) we have been
pleased to watch the evel'rincl'unsing
development toward artistic staging
and lighting of student plays.

worthy achievement displayed in A3111

sympathetic setting designed by Miss
Rust and executed by members at the
Experimental theatre.

‘ss Rust's recent work has delin-
itely removed her rrorn the r‘edlm or
the. "amateurish," Her setting for
“Mr. Pim" was finely conceived and
executed. Miss Rust‘s sense ol bal-
ance and color has improve , hei-
crattsmnship is commensurate with
her originality.

There is little need on this news
ion for gall, but we wish to mention
several obvious defects in Saturday's
play which ought to be ameliorated
in suceoding productions. The ques—
tian of tempo is ever important, and
“Mr. Phil" was often in need of accel-
elation.
