“YOU’RE WRONGA”
(From The Midland)

it is a fine thing to be at all times alert, wide
awake and ready to grasp any opportunity for improves
meat. It is quite another thing to continually notice and
correct mistakes of others. Both in the classroom and
in friendly conversation on the campus, some people are
always correcting misspelled and misprohounced words
with a superior air of knowledge. Such corrections often
hurt those who ignorautly or incorrectly make the mis-
takes.

The person who is quick Lo notice errors made by
others is perhaps slow to admit faults of his own.
Much improvement in speech may be made by listening
to mistakes of others and by avoiding those same mis-
takes thereafter. However, it does no one any good to
continually remark about anothcr's errors. Perhaps the
critical person may think thit it shows good manners,
but manners of this kind are only skin deep. It takes
good breeding to recognize a, mistake and keep still
about it,

SHOULD COLLEGIANS BE GROWN UP?
(From Daily Northwestern)

Maturity in the college student seems to be one thing
that the outside world does not see. In fact, it is pretty
hard for us inside the college closeior clothes, as you
\Vlllito see it ourselves. It is pretty generally accept-
ed by everybody that no matter what glamour. what
scholastic success, what athletic prowess a. collegian
may have, he does not have any great amount of mature
judgment. College students are classified as pretty
scatterhrained, even by themselves. The contention was
held in these columns, in connection with another sub-
ject not so long ago that eollegians glorified in their
carefree attitude.

A recent survey conducted at the University of
Wisconsin gives proof that the general run of college
students are in college in order to get a start in the
business world after graduation. The thing that the
business world values must, as any prospective employer
will tell, is maturity and balanced judgment.

Columns 01 editorial comment in newspapers from
Maine to California and from Oshkosh to Kalamazoo
have been devoted lately to what they term “the pre-
cocious pupil." There have been numerous instances
cited wherein those who blossomed too soon, correspond»
ingly went to seed, Along with it all, the press of the
nation has, at one time and another, expressed a belief
in the immaturity of the average college student»
whether “precocious" or not.

It Seems to us, then, that alongsidc our Austin
Scholar house, our Deering library. and our halls of
scholastic pursuit should be erected a huge "pickling
vat." as it were, wherein could be clipped the college
student to come forth with some semblance of maturity.
What this "pickling vaL” should be we cannot say. for
like most of those suggesting reform, that is as "fsr
as we got." However, it is pretty manifest that somer
thing- should be done about collegiate immaturity.

_ Ci
A GRO‘IVING TENDENCY
(From “The Silllpsollizul")

Dr. Walter B. Fitkin of Columbia university, New
York, speaking at the Oregon State Teachers' associ-
ation meeting in Portland on the subject, "Leaders of
Men," made the statement that it is impossible to train
leaders for definite jobs. The world is moving so fast
and conditions are changing so rapidly that we cannot
predict what will be required of the leaders of 20 years
hence.

A hundred years ago it could be done. At that
time a generation meant little change Ill any line of
activity, but the methods today in any occupation may
be entirely changed in a few years. What can be done
is to give the student a broad foundation upon which
he can build and the spirit and desire to keep up with
the procession,

This idea is illustrated also by the statement of a
country superintendent to the effect that graduates from
normal schools where methods are emphasized are usual-
ly good teachers the first two or three years and then
they seem to get in a rut and stay there while college
graduates are poor teachers the first year or two but
get better as they have more experience. Their broadcl-
lraimng allows them to meet conditions as they find
them and to rise above their training.

If these conclusions are correct, and they can liar-d-
ly be doubted, it shows a greater need for the liberal arts
colleges rather than the technical schools.

The high spot of the program was
tbc icII-iaIkallle set of variations by
Johannes Brahms, on a theme by For
ganini. The theme was of no censor
‘uucncc, the notes of a cuckoo clock
would have served lust as well, but
Brahms made it the text of a long
series of fairy tales as ingenious and
varied as the Arabian Nights.

about all that is lclt of the fad for
Turkish music which seized Vienna

when the Viennese recalled how the
janissaries thundered theIr cymbals
at the gates of Europe a hundred
years before,

The encorcs included Rameau'
"Cuckoo." and Tauslg's arrangement
of a Strauss waltz. Strauss was the
Sousa of his time. Perhaps In some
future program Coldssnrl will play a
pianistic arrangement of ”El Capitan
by some composer yet to appear.
