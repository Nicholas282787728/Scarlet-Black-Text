Harry Brundidge to Talk Here

 

Lingle Writer
Head Speaker
of Press Meet

High School Journalists

to Hear ‘Adventures

in Reporting’

Harry T. Brundidge, St. Louis Star
reporter who received notoriety last
summer for his writings in connec-
tion with the murder of Alfred
”Jake" Lingle, Chicago Tribune Te~
porter, will be the principal speaker
at the convention of the Iowa High
School Press association here Nov.
14-15.

Bruudidge was assigned by the
Star to write a series of copyrighted
stories on crime in Chicago. He
charged in the articles that other
Chicago newspaper men beside
Lingle were grafters.

Testiiiod Before Grand Jury

The stories written by Brundidge
were reprinted in the Chicago Tri-
bune from the St. Louis Star, and
were the center of a storm
of criticism by the Chicago press. He
was called before the grand jury in
Chicago to testify about the suppos-
ed newspaper “racketeering," which
he discussed in his stories.

An interview with Al Capone,
Chicago gangster, which Brundidge
obtained at Miami Beach, Fla, was
also copyrighted by the Star and re-
printed by the Chicago Tribune. Ca-
pone denied the interview after its
publication. He told Brundidge it
was no use to attack Chicago graft,
and thpt everyone would make a
monkey out of him. ”You're right;
because you're right, you're wrong,"
Brundidge quoted Capone as saying.

Will Speak of Adventures

Brundidge will speak some time
Friday of the convention. He has
given as the topic of his talk, “Ads
ventures in Newspaper Reporting.’

other speakers for the convention
have not been decided. Letters have
been mailed by Herschel M. Colbert,

Bridgham Pays

Vergil Tribute

Chapel Address Delivered;
Manchester Professor
Here Dec. 12

Ve-rgil, the Roman poet, is being
honored today in every country of
the world, even though he lived 2,000
years ago.

Crinnell has paid special tribute to
him through a talk given by Prof. J.
M. Bridgham at chapel Wednesday,
while Prof. Cecil F. Lavell will speak
at vespers tomorrow aftemoon with
Vergil as the subject of his talk. Fu
lher recognition will be given him
when Prof. R. S. Conway of the Uni»
versity of Manchester, Eng., will den
liver a lecture on ,Vergil Dec. 12,

Vergil Country Born

Like many another person of re»
nown, Vergil was‘ country born and
bred. His birthplace is in the far
north of Italy, With the dream of
being a poet dominating his exis-
tence, he attended school at Cre~
mono and the University of Milan, at
which latter institution he became a
close friend of the nephew and adopt-
ed son of Julius Caesar, Octavius,
who later became the emperor Aug-
ustus Caesar.

Vergil preferred his country home
to the place which was prov'idcd for
him in Rome, but he kept in close
touch with the rulers of the nation.
Years later, when Rome had become
urban and the yeomah farmers,
whose industry had made the empire
great, were drifting to the city, Aug-
ustus called on his old friend Vergil
to write something that would turn
the minds of these drifters back to
agriculture and the cultivation of the

Men Listed by Floors

One of Webster's deﬁnitions for
“herd" is “a crowd of common peo-
ple; rabble,” but this certainly can‘t
be applied in the matter of the pub—
lication of Grinnell's herd book, the
1930-31 edition of the college student
directory:

So perhaps the popular name for
the handy aid to telephone sociability
results from the fact that the entire
student body is herded into the one
book.

Long awaited by dormitory men in
anticipation of once more using the
formula, ”met you at the general,"
the directory' will be ready for the
press Monday or Tuesday, and will
probably be distributed during the
latter part of next week. Necessary
last minute changes, however, may
hold over the publication until the
following week.

Men Listed by Floors

A number of important changes
have been made in the listings. Ad-
dresses of men in the dormitories
will be given by ﬂoors instead of
room numbers, in compliance with a
request made by switchboard opera-
tors. In this way telephone connec—
tions will be made much more swift-
ly. Addresses in the quadrangle will
continue to be room numbers, because
of the buzzer system in that building
which opcrates in each room. ’

Telephone numbers of town stu-
dents will be listed for the ﬁrst time,
as well as addresses of league board
members, house councils, and councils
of house chairmen and cottage chair.

Y.M.C.A. Has Discussions,
Plans Chest Fund Drive

The weekly meeting of the Young
Men’s Christian association was held
in Smith hall clubroom Thursday
evening. Paul Beall, treasurer, an—
nounced that the Pioneer chest drive
would begin next Thursday and last
the remainder of the week.

After the business meeting the
audience was divided into three
groups. Prof, Earl D. Strong, who re-
cently returned from Russi , led a
discussion group on Russia, Prof.
Paul S. Woods’ group discussed cam-
pus problems, and the Rev. Mr, Bart—
te-r, pastor of the First Congrega-
tional church at Cilman, discussed
religion with a third group.

The next meeting of the YMCA.
will be held Oct. 30, at which time
a business man from Des Moines has
been secured to give the address.

Speedball Tins
Won by Smith,
Gates Hall Men

With Captain Scott leading the
scoring, the Gates hall speedball
team piled up a 9 point lead in the
first quarter, and easily trounced the
Lang—an aggregation, 27 to e, Thurs-
day afternoon.

Gates had no trouble in taking the
ball through Langan’S line with a
well organized passing attack, and
then sending the ball through the
goal posts for a score. When Langan
was able to get the ball, it found dif-
ﬁculty in breaking through the strong
Gates defensive.

Scott was the high point man for
Building Four, running up six points
in the ﬁrst quarter, a goal in the
third quarter, and then climaxed it
by making a goal on the kick at the
opening of the last quarter.

Alexander and Canright each made
a goal in the first period. Schulr
berg made 'a goal, and snagged apass
for five points in the third quarter.
while Wolfe added another point with
a free kick. Schulberg got a goal
in the last period to complete the
scoring.

Fabian made a lucky goal on
Gates from the 30 yard line during
the beginning, and Joy accounted for

chapter Mr. Hoover discusses the
problem of how to reduce the inter—

‘Dnd’ Once a Sailor

Dad Richardson hasn’t read the
book and doesn't know Mr. Hoover’s
plan for inducing ﬁsh to nibble more
frequently, but he does know Some—
thing about ﬁshing and has his own

Years ago Dad was a sailor. He
