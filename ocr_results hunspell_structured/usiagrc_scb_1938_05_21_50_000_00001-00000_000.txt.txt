Payne Wri’res
Biography

.l. B. Grinnell,
Founder of City,
Topic of New Book

The State Histo ieal society of
Iowa has announced the publicar
tion in July of “J. B. Grinnell,”
a biography of one of the found
ers of this city written by Charles
E. Payne, head of the department
of history,

The book is the ultimate out-
come of a request for Payne to
write an 800 word biography of
J. B. Grinnell for the American
Dictionary of national biography

During his research, Payne be-
came interested in his subject
and found so much material that,
at the suggestion of Dr. Benjamin
F‘. Shambaugh, superintendent of
historical society who is editing
the biography, he wrote the book
now in preparation of being puh-
iished.

Payne spent seven years in ma
termittant research and prepara-
tion on the story of a man who
was minister, both national and
state legislator, pioneer settler and
promoter, agriculturist and aholi-
tionis .

A pioneer of this vicinity, Grin—
nell set aside lots in the village
which is today Grinnell, 1a. The
proceeds of the sales went into
a literary fund which was the
beginning of Grinnell college, and
was largely responsible for the
transfer of Iowa college from
Davenport to Grinnell in 1858.

The book will be ready for
distribution in August.

 

Hut or Cold,
Water Smells
Like Cabbage

You Can’t do either- ytm'
can’t drink the stuff, and you
can‘t wash in it. That ye‘ldw
water with the delightful odor
is here againl To drink the
water would be to hoist the
skull and bones on a black
flag, 1t is foolish to wash 'c.
it, for old B. o. is much sweet-
er than yellow water which
smells like cabbage.

First, only the hot water
was had; then the worrying
was not so pertinent, for one
could wash the smell off with
cold water and a person could
drink without getting part of
the pipe down his throat. But
now both have gone bad.

Only a few solutions to the
problem have been offered~one
is to run all the way from
Macy house and from the oth—
cr men's halls to the Gates hall
fountain to drink and to brush
one's teeth.

But the only flaw seems to
be the difficulty in taking a
hath iii the Gates fountain:

After 50 Years, ‘
Is Still Humorous

Praises Production;
Duncan Play Draws
Critic's Comment

By Carl A. Niemyer

“Trial by Jury,” the Gilbert
and Sullivan operetta presented
by the drama department Thurs-
day and Friday nights, proved to
have lost none of its humor in the
50 and more years since its first
presentation.

The satire is still fresh and
pointed, and both music and
words give the actors oportunity
to enter vigorously into the spirit
of the play. This opportunity the
performers of last night seized,
Both acting and singing wcre
bright and lively, and as usually
happens when everyone on the
stage is having a good time, the
audience has a good time, too.

bride sang clearly and displayed a
pleasant voice. Donald Ward, al-
though his head was invisible to
those sitting in the balcony, was
obviously doing a good job, what
he said being understandable even
though he could not be seen. F.
Walter Huffman was particularly
effective in his opening solo.

For this critic, the chief diffi-
culty with the Gilbert and Sulli-
pan opercttas has always been
that the performers are usually
saying what appear to be side-
splitting things without bothering
to cnunciate theni clearly.

Last night's performance was
