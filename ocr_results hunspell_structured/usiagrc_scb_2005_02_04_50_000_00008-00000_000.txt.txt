the scarlet and black

Student provides The VOice Of

co-commentary

I’ve been calling football and
basketball games with John Mar—
tenson of KGRN for four years. He’s
the play—by-phay guy, and I’m the
color commentary or analysis guy.
Martenson’s job'is to say what‘s
happening as it happens (e.g.
"Johnson shoots and scoresl"),
and I analyze it (eg. ”Nice play by
Johnson!”).

Color commentary guys are
stereotypically impassioned ex~
jocks or coaches who can’t turn
a complete sentence and draw ire
from fans. (’“Nice play by John-
son?’ Icould come up with better
bilge than thatl") Of course, I'm
not really an ex-jock, so I have to
rely on what I’ve picked up from
watching other people play and
mlk about the game.

Each sport presents its own
problems, though. For basketball,
there's loads of action, so I’ve
got to struggle to get a word in
edgewise, and, let's face it, ”Nice
play by Johnson” isn’t exactly
scintillating analysis, So my job
is to find the one thing I saw in
the last 30 seconds that was most
important to whatever happened,
and talk about that.

Martenson, meanwhile, has to
talk for almost the whole game,
and he keeps informal stats too,
so his call is basically a stream of
names, numbers and point totak.
Its a bit humbling sometimesr

Probably the toughest part of
announcing for KGRN is that be-
cause it’s radio, the audience cans
not see whatI see. This means my
job is to paint a picture of what
happens as quickly as possible,
knowing that some of the listen-
ers will think I’m an uninformed,
lobotomized buffoon and some
will think I'm so full of technical
jargon that I’m incomprehensible.

Without a doubt, the most im-
portant part of calling is to make
it clear that you care about the
game. Even if one's team is get-
ting their lunch handed to them,
there's always something inter
esting going on. And if my voice
clearly demonstrates that I still
care about the proceedings, there’s

a much better chance the audience _

will keep listening.

John Martenson turned his love
of sports into a career in radio

BY SARAH MIRK

Rndio announcing is not what it used out to be.
For some, the mention of the profession Conjures up
connotations of19505 noir radio plays and men wirli
deep, mysterious, slightly srnricmsxdincd voices,

In ienlity, KGRN studios iajust a standard Sli’llill’
hut-diligent ofﬁce (albeit with some rooms sealed
off by thick, sound-proof pliant), complete with the
obligurory porrcd pinnr mid u diarincr Lick or smoky,
privnteveye types whispering into Ol‘rﬂll' microphones
about cops nnd domes.

Insrcad, the man behind rhe microphone—evcly
morning it s n.m., onywnyiis John Mnrrcnson, rhc
official radio announcer for Griniiell College baskets
ball games. Back in the bygone dnys orhigh school,
Mnrrenson played a sport—or two—for cncll season,

Lntcr, still ﬂucnr in rhcinrgon ofbasketbnll, base»
bull, football and track, Marlenson grndunrcd from
college and immediately began working as n rodlo
sporrscoslcr: “I'm one ofrhose rare breeds who, when
he got our of college, knew whnr hc wnnrcd ro get
into.“

Growing up, Mnrrcnson would often wotcli sports
on TV, but unlike most kids, he would ruin down the
volume and listen iiisrerid to the radio commentary,
which “gives :1 little more ﬂzwm to it." Since then,
lVlilrtcnson has announced for so runny games rhnt he
cannot remember whnr his ﬁrst nnnouncing gig was,
knowing only that “it’s been 20 years, that's for sure."

Over the passing decades, the part of Mnrrcnson’s
style that has evolved rhc most is his on-nlrvemaculnr,
he said. “You always try and rhrow in some ncwvcrb-
age,"hc explained. “For three pointers,'Tlirce poinrer
on rhe white!’—you gotta say more thnnjiist that. You
gorrn shy, ‘Tlirer: dingerl' or ‘Trifcctor on the why!”

Good announcing, Morrcnson said, is “more rhnn
nuything,just adjectives, verbs." With no nine to ﬂip
through a thesaurus mid-game, Mortenson hones his
exuberant diction by tuning into
“other play by play guys" to see
how they say things.

Usually, Mnrtcnson just an—
nounccs the plays as the referees
call them, but if the audience ,6,
acts with exceptional antagonism
to n rereree’s decision, Martenson may throw in o dip-
lomuric linc like,“Tlic audience seemed to think that
looked like a travel!"

one orthc most difficult parts ofnnnouncing is
keeping up w‘irli the pace of the game, Mnrtcnson
said, especially with rhe inrnmously rapid-arc Gri -
nell basketball team. He aims to tell his radio éudl’
ence exactly who is doing what down on the ﬂoor,
which means keeping track of n dizzying array of
names, numbers and plays.

“It's a challenge," Morronson said. but with the
true athlete mentality, he added, “It’s okay. I don’t
mind the challenge."

Although Mnrrcnson likes the challenge, he od-
m‘irs that it's “really rough" to announce all on his
own. Any Grinncllinn can apply to connnnouncc the
KGRN games, and Martenson thoroughly apprecir

”/ get in from oflhc mike and the
mike goes on and boom!”

ntes having n student up in the booth With him to
provide nddirionnl commentoly. "The more smdent
involvement the better," he said, “I think tlidr's grcnr,
that’s how I got starred."

Mnrtcnson stays on top ofthe action by talking as
swiftly as he can while still (hyporhcricnlly) lcmninlng
intelligible.Murrcnsons voice is nnrul'nllysmoorli and
articulate, so he does not need to assume any special
mndevforrrndio pclsonnllry, hc slud. However, he does
need a lot otcnergy and enthusiasm,

0n rhe radio, Mnrrcrison said he goes Into "play
by play mode. I get in front ofthc mike and the mike
goes on and boom!” Under the inﬂuence of such exr
circmcnt, he maintains a remarknhle amount orcom-
posurc, very rarely shouting out anything nccidcnrally.
He has “never urrered any words rhnr would gcr our
FCC license removed,"he said.

Of course, a calm composure is not difficult or

some games: nfter wnrching hun-

snid some can be very, very born
ing. Games usually create (in more
gcric atmosphcrc in rhc gym, hur
“sometimes you gotta create your
7 own energy,“ he said.

“When rhc ball just isn’t going in the brisket, in-
nouncing is just really rough to do. You're pullin'
your hair.” At these trying times, Mnrrciisoii mkcs on
n casually sarcastic style, “I'll say something like, ‘They
can'( throw the ball in the ocean’ or ‘There’s another
shot missed ngaiiil'" he said,

Announcing for a college that so rigorously mains
rains its academic reputation presents Morlenson
wirli a unique set of players to keep track of on the
court. “You know, here in Division III," Martelison
said, “they’re not playing for scholarships. They're
playing for the love oflhe game.”

Alrhough Grinnell’s low division denotes it is a
less nhlcricnlly competitive school, Martenson thinks
that “in n way, it’s rougher" playing for Grinncll rhnn
for .1 Division I school, “because they're students lirst
here at Grinlicllc”

A day in
the life

Babcock
‘06

7:30 A.M.
Iwake up.
The dream I
was having about all women
wanting me was not real. Dammit.

9 AM. Intro to Political Sci
ence. We discuss what one word
means, such as ”politics” or
"power,” and by the end of the
class, we come to the conclusion
either that ”Gosh, nobody really
knows or agrees on what ’poli-
tics’ means,” or "Gosh, nobody
really knows or agrees on what
'power’ means," depending on
which word we’re discussing that
particular day.

10 AM. Field Theory, We talk
about ”ﬁelds” and "extensions"
and “algebraic numbers" These
at ﬁrst seem absurdly abstract
and useless, but I constantly
remind myself that they can,
in fact, be very directly applied
to other areas of mathematics,
which are in turn absurdly ab-
stract and useless.

”:15 AM. Lunch at Cowleer
eat with one of the three people
I have had as roommates, all of
whom suck, There are only two
options for food: chicken breasts
stuffed with lobster and topped
with cheese, a spice blend and
eggplant or hot dogs. I decide to
get a sandwich. It is mundane,
but familiar and tasty.

12 PM. Helpdesk. I ﬁx two or
three computers that do not
start up, Then there is nothing
else to do, so I harass whom-
ever happens to be working with
me, occasionally taking a break
to help a caller change his/her
password or use the AutoSum
feature in Excel.

3:l 5 PM. Automata, We discuss
either mathematical ideas I have
seen since high school or ab-
surdly complex ways to construct
functions. One of the students
points out that there are no
women in the class Once again,
I question whether mathematics
is really a good major.

5:30 P.M. Dinner. I eat the food.

7 PM. I realize that, at last, i
have no obligations for the rest
of the day, so I do what anyone
would in this situation: home—
work. Just kidding; actually, I
play Super Nintendo with my
roommate Darren McNabb '07 for
four hours. ‘

ll mu. I realize that it is late
and I should get some work
done. I start to do stuff. Darren
leaves for places unknown.

11:30 P.M. I start to feel tired,
go to bed and fall asleep think-
ing of math problems from Field
Theory homework.

l A.M. Darren stumbles in, wakes
me up and asks if he can use
some of my milk to make mac ’n’
cheese I consent and then am
unable to get back to sleep for
hours.
