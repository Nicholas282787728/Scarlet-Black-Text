Where’s That Spring Dlay?

Except for the cold wave a week ago, we
can safely stick our necks out and bring to
the attention of Those’ Who Rule, that the
snow has thawed, the leaves are out, and
in shol', it is time for a Spring Day.

We, the students, are bowed under a
heavy load of research papers, book reports
and back themes. In the short hours that
we can “play" we are bothered by the
thought of open books at home, of unfinish-
ed work to do.

The faculty, too, is weary of stacks of
papers to grade and unwritten comprehen-
sives.

All of us need a day of respite, a day to
enjoy the weather and sunshine and fun.

And so before its’ too hot, and before it’s
too late, let’s have a Spring Day!

Hl-yaI
This morning two new students came to
Grinnell campus. They have come a long
Way; this is a strange and new place; and
they may think we too are strange, because
America is big and we have a particular 'way
of living here.

Maybe Iowa slang is different from that

our favorite food is Candylands. But those
are little things. When it comes to the big
issues We shall all be pretty much alike,
That is why Grinnell students can be glad
these fellow students have come from Cali—
fornia just now.

There is much to be done here before the
semester ends. This is a big year, a cone
fused year, a year to work in and to re-
member. These new students will be in on
the work, they will help; we’re glad they
got here in time, for they will help make it
a good year.

We have had friends like them before
Those people we remember were, and are,
good friends. We are proud, knowing them.

Now we are acquainted with these two
students. Soon we may earn their friend-
ship.

So to them we say, ”Welcome to Grln<
nell.” It‘s nice seeing you.

0 Yes, We Have No Bananas.

To many food lovers, the war will hit home
with a thud when they learn that the hurn-
ble banana is about to become a great luxA
llry, a food for kings, not the masses. All
banana boats are being pressed into service
elsewhere. Other foods that will probably go
the same route as the banana arc the coco-
nut and the pineapple, to mention a few

No more bananas and cream, and the ba-
nana split is a thing of the past. The last
destroyer has had its launching on a way
greased with bananas.

But it is more than that. The banana re-
publics of Central America are facing rev—
qution, because the banana was their chief
source of income. This cut-off not only
means bankruptcy to the grower, but also
bankruptcy to the governments, for there
is an export tax on bananas. The United
State will probably be forced into buying all
these countries' bananas, throwing them in-
to the sea

It is easy to see that 'this opens up a
whole new world in Atlantic ocean flavors.
It is also easy to see that it constitutes
another great ‘expense on the Treasury, but
probably worth the price, if it retains the
1frindship of the Central American repub-
lcs.

The authors of this letter feel
that their plan did not receive
adequate recognition from the stu-
dent body. .This may be because
cash disbursement to student exe-
cutives is apt to place our system
on such it financial basis that
those in power would work for
their own gains rather that for
the benefit of the student body.

that any plan for student govern-

Following a long established tra-
dition, the department of drama
and the Grinnell College Chapter
of National Collegiate Players pre-
sented on Wednesday and Thurs—
day nights the annual program of
onesact plays written by Grin-
nell students. And as has also
become traditional, the audience
was delighted by the variety of
imagination and the sense of the
theater displayed by these young
plaWWrigllts. The only disap-
polntmont was the last minute
canceling of the pcrformencc of
William Buckley's “Flight 72" be—
cause of Orin Wallick’s’illness.

This year's program included
what might be Called respectively
a Comedy, a serious drama, and
a melodrama. Although its sub-
ject was trivial, "Rats Wear Er-
mine” by Barbara McCienon
showed pruiscwortliy dramatic
technique; the Complications of
the plot were carefully knotted as
the play got under Way and just
as carefully unraveled at its close.
The script was especially notable
because, more than either of the
other plays, it presented a hue
man being facing a Certain situ-
ation, changing under the stress
of circumstances, and finding its
own solution to its problem.

Kathryn Mills’ play, “You Have
No Right,” presented a timely as-
pect of the Iowa scene; the theme
was a. stronger one than those
of the other plays and was han-
dled with honest seriousness. As
drama the play has one serious
fault, however; the curtain rose
on a well-developed situation and

_ tre characterization was for the

most part static.

In his melodrama, "Wake up,
Jimmy,” clyde Bates attempted a
more complex bit of theater, and
for this reason the audience fol—
lowed the unfolding of the plot
with c keencr attention than it
gave to the preceding plays. As
a matter of fact, this play con-
tained too much; fascinating as it
was to watch. With its manifold
plot, its constant surprises, its
many exits and entranees. and its
change of Costume, it lacked the
unity that is peculiarly necessary
in a one-act play,

The presentation of the plays
under the direction of sore Sher-
man Pryor did much to bring
the original manuscripts to life.
One high point of the evening was
the acting or James Gardner, Who
can always be counted on for a
good performance despite his ten«
dency to let certain gestures per-
sist from one role to another,
Also outstanding was the perfor-
mance by Arlene Phillips of two
quite different parts in the course

of the evening. The droll drunk
(or pseudoAdrunk) of Julian Weil
was irresistibly funny, and Mari—
lyn Lilley made the tragic Ger~
man farm woman pitifully real.
Joseph Becker, filling in on short
notice, portrayed a college janitor
is a way that brought hearty
laughs from the audience. The
sets were more than adequate,
particularly the “small night club"
of ”Wake Up, Jimmy!"

The real significance of these
performances lies in the fact that
they represent the work of Gri -
ncll students who, under the gui —
ance of Mrs. Pryor, are doing cre—
ative work in all branches of the
theater. No person better typi<
fies just what this work is than
Kathryn Mills, who, having shown
her distinction as an. actress in
last fall’s production of ”Night
Must Fall,” demonstrated on the
present occasion the breadth of
llcr present training in the theater
having written, directed and de—
signed thc play, “You Have No
Right.” The tlircc plays compris-
ing this bill and the fourth play
that was unavoidably withdrawn
give us once again tangible evi—
dence of the active participation
of Grinnell College in the crea-
tive arts.
