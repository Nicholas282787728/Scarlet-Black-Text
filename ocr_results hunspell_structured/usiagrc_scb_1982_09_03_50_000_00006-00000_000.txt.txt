BEST BET r . , this weekend provides a lot
of good entertainment in the form of both
movies and concerts. All of the films are
excellent in their own way. but the most
appealing may be Sidney Lumet’s Prince
of the City (1979). Treat Williams. first
seen in Hair, stars as Danny Ciello, a
member of the New York police elite — a
“prince of the city." Ciello has a number of
good cases under his belt, but in the course
of enforcing the law he has also bent ﬁle
law. Yet Ciello, unlike some other cops
constantly in the make, lives by his own
code which he finds honorable. He is asked
to work on an undercover operation in-
vestigation and agrees to on the condition
that he won’t have to rat on the men on his
team. However, the state uses him for its
purposes and squeezes him into betraying
his friends, family and self. Based on the
experiences of New York detective Robert
beuci. the film illustrates what an authori-
ty acting out of interest for society. can do
to a man “the road to hell is paved with
good intentions.” Though nearly three
hours long, each minute of this iilm is
necessary as it effectively chronicles a
man's unwitting descent into moral am-
biguity and personal hell.

ANOTHER GOOD CHOICE . . . is ﬂ'le ex.
cellent production of Harper Lee's novel
To Kill a Mocking Bird 0962). Set in
Maycomb, Ala., in 1932, this film deals
with a central fatherchild relationship
and the violent iniringements upon it.
Gregory Peck. in one of his most powerful
performances, stars as the humane lawyer
trying to do right by his children, his socie»
ty and himselt. Living in a volatile, hate-
filled world, Peck must single-handedly
maintain harmony and teach humility to
his young children. The most compelling
thing about this movie is probably its
modesty and control. Evem unfold as
perceived by the children. Jem and Scout.
and only a child's understanding of man’s
inhumanity to man is realized. The film
does not dwell on violent excitement, such
as the attempted lynching, the trial for
rape or the violent revenge of the
neighbors. Instead, the more quiet, affec-
ting mood of the film is sustained. This
movie has its own subtle massage and is
one of the more sensitive treatments of
race relations in the South to he found.

ON A LIGHTER NOTE . . . And Now tor
Something Completely Diliercnt. This iilm
more than lives up to its name, as the
mighty men of Monty Python have at it
again. Nothing more than a total romp,
this film is perfect for those in the mood for
complete h—ivolity.

This group tends to favor composers
such as Brahms and Beethoven. However,
the musicians are also known lor perlorm-
ing jazz and popular music. as
demonstrated by the scheduled pet-fore
rhance of Gershwin’s “Preludes." The
Trio seems to shrug the “high-brow” im-
age, and does not want to be thought of as
stiff, classical musicians.

When they are not giving concerts at the

college, the Trio makes both national and
international tours. Their spring and sum-
mer are particularly tull of concert perfor-
mances. This summer they performed at
the Festival in Greenlake, Wis.

with two more years lelt on their present
contraca, the Mirecourt Trio plans to re-
main at Grinnell. They find satisfaction in
their present situation and feel no need to
change in the immediate future.

”Talley's Folly" gets underway
Full season in the planning

The theater department's first produc-
tion of the fall semester will be Lanlord
Wilson's two person drama, Talley's Folly.
Auditions were held Monday and Tuesday
of this week tor the parts of Sally Talley
and Matt Freedman.

The play takes place in Lebanon, a small
town in Southern Missouri at the Talley
family boathouse, traditionally known as a
folly. Sally Talley and Matt Freedman
hide from each other emotionally and
avoid personal interaction due to painful
experiences in their past. The play chron~
ciles their struggle to communicate with
each other and to overcome the personal
barriers in their relationship.

Matt, a Jewish accountant from St.
Louis. must deal with the anti-semitlsm of
Sally's family, plus his own personal feel-
ings about life and children which he fears
oppose Sally's views, Equally an issue is
Sally’s unfortunate secret which
prevented her marriage into another
wealthy family and which established her
as a social pariah. Through progress in

communication, Sally and Matt ulitmately
come to grips with their feelings {or each
other and realize the full potential of their
relationship.

Jan Czechowski, director of the produCr
tion, tried to get the rights for the play last
February, but was unable to for a variety
of reasons, primarily because a play can-
not be produced in more than one spot
within a certain diameter the produc-
tions will “compete" with each other try-
ing to draw from the same audience.
EarlierI someone else in the area was dOV
ing the play and supposedly a movie ver
sion was being planned. In March.
however, the opportunity to obtain the
rights arose again, and Czechowski, struck
by the idea oi a shorter play, bought it “for
our audiences sake.”

Czechowski, having muéh experience
with larger productions. including full~
scale musicals. is ready to do a smaller
show, A smaller show such as this one
allows for a greater intimacy between both
director and actor, and audience and ac-

tor. Plus, the size of Arena Theatre is well
suited to a personal drama of this sort in
terms of the proximity of performer and
spectator,

This smaller Arena production will also
help to offset the cost of the rest of the fall
season, The big production of the semester
is the upcoming Playboy or the Western
World, in November, to be directed by Sans
dy Moffet and performed in Roberts
Theatre. Spring will offer lighter fare in
the form of Shakespeare‘s Measure for
Measure.

In comparison with these other produc~
tions, the budget for Talley's Folly will be
minimal. Czechowski feels they will pros
bably spend more on royalties than on the
production itself. The remaining costs of
the production will depend on the set
design, but still most of the materials will
be available within the department.

Talley‘s Folly is a Pulitzer Prize winning
part of Lanford-Wilson‘s triology which in-
cludes the critically acclaimed Fifth of Ju-
ly. wilson, “a perceptive writer who draws
great characters," and his plays have an
excellent reputation and should provide
compelling theater for all.
