By Jack Kelsey

Atter two postponeinehts. and con.
sidcrnble dickering, the annual lvlisss
our-i Valley conference swimming
meet has been permanently post—
poned, according to Elton Roscn,
Grinnell swimming coach. The agree-
ment came tinally as a result or the
illness by which Clark Elbert, and
Bob Adams, both mainstays on the
Pioneer team, were stricken. Last
week the meet was postponed due
to the bank holiday, and at on corlier
date it was announced that Grinnell
and Washington university ct st.
Louis would be the only teams ens
tered.

Rosen was of the opinion that it
would be futile to try to whip his
men into shape again tor the meet.
it it was merely postponed for an—
other week, as the swimmers have
been working out since October.
Dore Mnlbrough was timed iii the

Now that this meet has been posts
pontd, it means that the crihnell
tanksters have completed an unde-
Ieatcd swimming season with the fol-
loi ‘hg record.

numerous records in meets this

The swimming squad was not the
only one atiected by the epidemic, for
the Pioneer track team will miss the
services of Harold “Gander" Ander-
son when it competes in the indoor
quadrangular meet at Iowa City, sat»
urday night. Although he has only
been in two meets this season, An-
dersoh has become quite essential to
the team in the quarter mile and in
the mile relay. Coach Lester Duke
says that he is crossing his fingers
hoping that no additional members of
his squad will he attllcted,

The discussion on the topic “The
Contribution of Religion to the New
Age" was led by Mr. Inglis, and the
various members gavc their views.

It was generally agreed that there
was too much orthodoxy, theology
and institutionalisin in the modcrn
church. and that churchrs must re-
state their principles in terms of soc-
ial good.

During the discussion it was sug»
gcstcd that the church might revive

as to whether a code of ethics was

One of the tricks of cigarette advertis-

EXPLANATION: All cigarette monu-
facturers use heat treatment. It is a
routine process of manufacture. The
ﬁrst Camel cigarette ever made was
manufactured under the heat-treating

process. Every one of the billions oﬂ
Camels produced since has received
the necessary heat treatment.

Harsh, raw tobaccos require inten-
sive processing under high tempera.
tures. The more expensive tobaccos,
which are naturally mild, call for only
a moderate application of heat. Heat
treatment never can make cheap, in.

This is the most important statemene
ever made in a cigarette advertisement.

means. Then try Camels.
