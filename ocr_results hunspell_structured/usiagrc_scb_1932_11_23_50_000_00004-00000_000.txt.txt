ST. LOUIS, Mo.—st. Louis’ foot-
ball classic or the season will be
played Thanksgiving afternoon be
tween Washington university and st.
Louis University, two gridiron rivals
“since 1900. The game, which annually
draws the largest crowd of any game
in St. Louis, will feature the playing
of one of the strongest aggregations
st. Louis U. has had in many years,
and a team of Washington Bears that
have been rejuvenated by Jimmy Con-
zelman. new Washington head coach.

St. Louis Turns Tables

‘ning eleven games to two, with only
two tie games. But last year St.
Louis U. turned the tables with a
score of 34 to o.

This year St. Louis U. has had al-
‘most all of the last year material,
supplemented by a strong freshman
squad of 1931 that has given Coach
Chile Walsh almost limitless reserve
strength. In the backfield against
Washington, coach Walsh will use

 

men that will outweigh the Bears'i

backfield by some 30 pounds to the
man.

Mediocre Bear Material

Inability to Continue Nitrate
Sales Chief Cause
of Trouble

By VIRGINIA SCOVELL

“Those people who think that the
United states has had more than her
share of the depression, should be able
ito view the situation in Chile,” Miss
Elisa Curtis, instructor in Spanish,
jstated in 2m account of the visit
.which she made last summer to her
‘former home in that country.

"The status of economic condi-
tions," she explained, “is due largely
to the loss of the sale of nitrate which
has long been one of the chief pro-
ducts of Chile."

Pesos Fall

“As a result, money values have
decreased so that the Chilean “pesos"
which originally gave eight coins to
the American dollar, now gives 60."
, ”Chile has also suffered from polit—
ical disturbances but it is hoped that
with the recent election of President
Alcssandri, who was a former presi-
dent and champion of the middle
class, a new democracy will be fos»
tcred and hence a rise in business
conditions."

Socilll Changes Impress

Miss Curtis, who had not visited
lChile for 15 years, was impressed
‘with the social changes which had
resulted from the depression and
which was exemplified, she said, in
the number of women of the aristoc-

,tals include 34 scored against 2 for
an alumni team at the start of the
season. Subtracting these points still
leaves the Washington club with more
points than any team at this school
