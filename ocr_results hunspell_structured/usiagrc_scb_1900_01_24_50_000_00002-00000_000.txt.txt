“THE FACULTY of Grinnell colr
lege hasdecided to give the editor
in-chiet of SCARLET AND BLACK.
the college paper, three hours
credit;tllelocalandathletic editors
each one hour credit,"7Vz'delle-
Repwizr,

The above comment is good
news trorrr a tar country to the edi-
torial staff of SCARLET AND BLACK.
We were aware that the faculty at
Ames took some such action seVr
eral months ago and remarked
upon it somewhat enviously, but
we have not as yet, beeninformed
that the faculty of Iowa college
were disposed to tollow in the
footsteps of their agricultural
brethren, We have only thanks
for the joytul intelligence con~
veyed to us by the Violent-Reporter
and sincerely hope that it may
turn out to be a reality. We have
not the slightest doubt that we
deserve the credit and it is our
fondest hope that it may be
granted. .

CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION has
been provoked at the State Uni-
versity over the question oi the
right otany literary society or the
university to engage in debate
with a similar society of another
institution. It hardly seems as
though discussion were necessary
on this point. Aliterary society
is master of its own actions, and
if it feels strong enough and has
the enterprise to enter into a de-
bate with another society, we can
see no objection. A debate be:
tween two societies is not a debate
between two schools, and should
not be considered as such. As to
whether it is justiﬁed in entering
into such a debate, each society
must be its own judge, For our
part we are glad to see the step
taken by the Chrestomathian so-
ciety, It is only another sign ot
increasing interest and enthusiasm
in society work, and as such we
are glad to welcome it.

THERE CAN be no doubt that
the experiment oi doing away
with semester examinations has
fully vindicated itself. We are
sure that no one will deny that
the present system of drop exam-
inations at intervals during the
year is a better test of a student’s
knowledge and a better incentive
to scholarship than the old way

 

of requiring of the student, in a

week’s time, the results ofa whole
half year’s work. To the student
the new system means the aboli»
tion oi a week characterized by
ceaseless and proﬁtless cramming
and or a liberal expenditure ot
midnight oil with no further ob»
ject in view than making a pre-
sentable show of the knowledge
which he has acquired during his
semester's work. It has been too
often the student’s custom to put
his half year's work into that one
week, but this tendency has been
at least partially obviated by the
necessity which he is under to
keep his subjects of study well in
hand in order to be ready to meet
atest at any time. It has long
been the feeling among the stu—
dents that semester examinations
were unnecessary and untair,‘ and
we feel that their abolition has
been fully justiﬁed.

The program given at Goodnow
Scientiﬁc Association Monday
evening consisted ot but two numr
bers, but what it lacked in quanr
tity it made up in quality,

Mr. Macartney was the ﬁrst on
the program, giving a very inter-
esting talk on “Pasteur,” making
it biographical and also discuss-
ing his work quite at length.

Dr. Newman followed with a
discussion of "Tuberculosis,"
bringing out many facts in regard
to this dread disease and discuss»

ing preventative measures,

Miss Nath gave a paper on the
German folkrsong, telling princi-
pally ot the growth tram the time
of the Minne singers and Meister
singers. ‘

Miss Ethel Cox told of Russian
music which is especially characr
terized by the use of the minor
mode. The Russian folk-song is
very interesting the range some

times being so small as to include
only tour or ﬁve tones.

Miss Fanny Buchanan tavored
the society with a piano solo
which was given in an easy, pleas-
ing manner.
