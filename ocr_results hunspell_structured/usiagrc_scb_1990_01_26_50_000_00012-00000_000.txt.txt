Three Point
Shot is the
Fatal Blow

by Susan Thomas

It has been said the third
time is a charm, but ask any
member of the women’s
basketball team, and she would
beg to differ. Last Saturday, in
the team’s third conference
game, the Pioneers suffered a
disappointing 71—70 loss to
Illinois College on a three-point
shot in the final three seconds of
the game, This loss gave
Grinnell a 7-4 overall record,
and a second place conference
standing at 2—1.

After a sluggish start, the
team faced a 35-21 halftime
deficit. coach Eskildsen
regrouped the team at the half,
and the Pioneers went on to
outscore tlte Lady Blues 49-36
in the second half by applying
tremendous pressure both
offensively and defensivelyt
