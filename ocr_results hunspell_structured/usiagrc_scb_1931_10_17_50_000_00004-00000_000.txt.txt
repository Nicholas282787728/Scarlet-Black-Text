A Chips 1

By uLuE HAGEN
“Finland is the most American
country in Europe." said Mrs. Har-
ald B, Holst m a recent interview.
Mrs. Holst. whose husband is an ins
structor in voice in the department
of music, returned from Finland
Monday, with her thl'ee-yearrold
daughter, Karla Annikki. Mr. Holst
has been absent on leave for the last
year, and returned in September to
resume his duties. Both are natives
of Finland, Mrs. Holst being of
Swedish extraction and Mr. Holst,
Danish.

“Of course 1 am glad to be back-—
my husband is here!" laughed Mrs.
Holst, in answer to the conventional
question. “But as far as countries are
concerned, I naturally prefer Finland.
I have nothing against America, ex-
‘cept that I nearly freeze to death in
the winter.”

Not Cold

Mrs. Holst went on to explain that
most people have the mistaken idea
that Finland is a bitterly cold coun-
try. but the actual fact is that 10 de~
grees below zero here is worse than
20 degrees below there. because the
Finnish climate is drier. There is a
lot of snow there, however, and the
chief winter sport is skiing.

”Finland is a dream of a place for
tourists. There are 40,000 big lakes
there, and one simply cannot get
away from water. It is so near the
land of the midnight sun that it never
gets dark there at all. One can read
outside comfortably all night, for
sunset colors simply merge into those
of dawn."

Gentlemen Educated

Mrs. Holst says that there is no
such thing as class distinction in
Finland. The mistaken American idea
that one has to have money does not
exist there. It is the amount of edu~
cation which determines the Finn’s
caste. Even though he is born a
peasant, the Farm may. by his educa—
tional training, become a gentleman
of higher ranking.

“Finland is very modern." contin-
ued Mrs. Holst. “It has all the Cons
veniences of America, plus the use
of maids. The most ordinary people
there have at least one maid, and of-
ten two. 1 don‘t think a Finnish maid
works half as hard as an American
housewife, and she receives a Comr
fortable living wage, besides." When

Finland Like America, Mrs. Holst

asked if any or the old picturesque
costumes were worn in the Finland
of today. Mrs. Holst said. “I traveled
all over Finland and didn't see one,
much to my Sorrow.”

Like Grnduztte Schools

The Finnish school system is based
on that of the German people, and
since compulsory public school at-
tendance is required, even the peas-
nnts can read and write. The gym-
nasium corresponds to the American
elementary school. but the university
there is more like American graduate
schools, or like the last two years of
college plus graduate study. Consee
ducntly, Finnish students are older
than Americans. and are preparing
for definite professions.

There are three large universities
in Finland. and in the largest and
oldest one the teaching is done in
both Swedish and Finnish, Mrs. Hoist
explained that Finland used to belong
to Sweden. and even after the Rus-
sian war separated the two countries,
the tradition that higher education
should be in Swedish, persisted.
There is a movement in the largest
university to make the language all
Finnish.

No Manual Labor

“Finnish universities have no dorm-
itories," continued Mrs. Holst, “and
all of the students have rooms in the
city. They never work for their board
and room, and neither do they work
on the side. They do work during
their three manms' summer vacation,
but only at something that will help
them in their chosen profession. You
see, the Finnish student does not be-
lieve in manual labor

“One can advance rapidly in the
Finnish university if he so desires,"
Mrs, Holst said, “and again, he may
study for 10 years before he gets a
degree. The first degree which is
given is a masters, which is obtained
after four years or less of study.

No Examinations

"In our universities there is no
checking up on a student's attends
ance at lectures, and there are no
examinations. The student is suppos-
ed to have mature judgment by the
time he enters the university, and it
is up to him how long he wishes to
stay there before completing his
course."

Mrs, Holst also remarked that the
departments in the Finnish univers-
