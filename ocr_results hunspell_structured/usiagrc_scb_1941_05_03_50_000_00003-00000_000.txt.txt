Moody Comments.

Moody said that he would he
glad to leave all the musical
arrangements he had made, and
also the major dance routines.
Every student who was to take
part in this year's production,
with but few exceptions, will be
returning to Grinnell, and there is
no reason why it could not be
produced again next fall, Moody
added.

The only major change would
have to to in regard to managers
and producers, as Moody, Anthony
Vranek, ‘Ray Nelson, and Bert
Anderson will graduate this June.
Edward Stone, who was stage
manager tor the production this
year, will also graduate, leaving
another gap to the ﬁlled, Moody
said.

Script Arnimhlc,

The entire script and music are
available to students interested in
reviving the musical comedy next
year, though Moody suggested
that the most efficient method of
insuring- its success would be to
organize tiio comniittco'borore this
semester is over.

In that way the producers
would be ahle to give the new
group many suggestions tor im»
movements that could be added,
Moody stated.

During the summer months, the
entire play might be perfected,
leaving only the harest routine
husiness to he attended to before
the opening night.

‘ «Reviewer Says
By Lois Stewart.

Tashamira, the Croatioii dancer,
brought a sphere of abstract un-
reality to the Gl'ilmell audience
Thursday night when she pl'e»
sonted a program of dance in
lyric mood.

E tic in appcarancc and plas-
tic in movcmcnt, she brought an
air ot sophistication to the stage
in all its baieness. Her striking
appearance and coloriul costumes
added to the effectiveness of the
program.

The dancer injected enough of

an oi tasciiiaticn into the slighte
est movement. Speaking with
overy move of her slender body,
and particularly with her very
, fingertips, she expressed the mood
of each dance to a degree that
even the most unappreciative
understood,
starting the program with “Ine
vitation to the Dance," which
was not a dance meant for the
tiny auditorium stage, Tashamira
built her program to a point that
was fully appreciated when she
piesentcd “Belle ot the Dance
Hall,” and her interpretations of
negro spirituals.
