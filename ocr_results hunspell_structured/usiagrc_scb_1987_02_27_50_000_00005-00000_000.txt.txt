lt‘t-h. 27. not?

by Christine Black

Despite Louisiana's economic distress
caused by the deflated oil industry. Mardi
Gras will be celebrated. bringing
necessary revenue to New Orleans in the
iorm oi tourism and private enterprise.

Parade "krewes" composed primarily
of suburban middle- and lowerrclass
members have suffered more than
wealthy. traditional krewes However.
some traditional. all»male krewes have
opened membership up to women in order
to provide necessary revenue

Arthur Hardy. editor of the annual
"Mardi Gras Guide."'said. "I thliik what's
going to make Mardi Gras better this year
is that there are lewer parades than last
year We‘ve lost live krewes and the news
media has jumped on that as negative. I
don’t think it's a negative thing. and I think
perhaps we need to lose a iew more
parades."

Errol LaBorde. a Mardi Gras historian.
agreed. saying. "Especially in urban
areas. you've seen almost proriteering on
the part oi entrepreneurial investors who
go out and rent cheap floats. sell positions
on Ihe float. thron a few bands logether
and call it a parade. They put the burden
on the government; they cheapen Mardi
Gras. they set a bad example lor tourists
and l'm worried abou| people growing up
with these parades not seeing the magic or
Mardi Gras."

The collapse oi the oil industry has had a
traumatic effect on the city. because the
leaders depended heavily on the oil market
to keep the New Orleans economy alloat.
Consequently. the market poteniial oi the
ports location and or Louisiana produce
was never developed

LaBorde said. "The only industry really
working tor the city right now is tourism.
and New Orleans is a hot tourist town. You
can look at the Democrats and
Republicans who fought to have their
presidential conventions here." The
Republicans won that light.

inBorde also pointed out that even
though the costs for hole] accommodations
are inllated. downtown occupancy for this
year is lot) percent.

Both LaBorde and Hardy agreed that the
Carnival season benefits the tourist “1'
dustry as well as more domestic issues.
Because it is a public lestival paid tor by
the participants. the city does not spend
anything to promote or support Mardi
Gras ‘

The 1987 issue of the "Mardi Gras

tourists provide over $200 million dollars in

still room for improvement. He believes
that there is "tremendous potential lor

Publicity about Mardi Gras and New

about the image the nation has at the Car-
