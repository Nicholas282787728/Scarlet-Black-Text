WmLF. n has beena «disappoint
ment that the home meet could
not be held before the dual nicet,
yet under the faithful work of our
trainer, a track team has been de~
veloped which we think will be
able to hold its own against the
athletes ot our neighboring instir
tution next Saturday, The team
has worked under difﬁculties this
spring. having lost rive 0t the best
men of last year's team, and being
hindered by the perversity of the
weathertroin beginningworkearly
in the season. S. U. I, have sev~
eral new men who have done start-
ling performances in their evcnts,
so that their team will be the equal
if not the superior of last year's
team. But for the fact that there
is to be a league game of baseball
played on the home grounds next
Saturday, SCARLET AND BLACK
would urge the students to accom-
pany the track team to Iowa City.
This fact, however, will prevent
any large aggregation of students
from going down to witness the
meet.

Tiii NIS players seem to be
slow in getting out {or work this
year, With two tennis tours
naments held on the home
grounds this spring. it is high time
that systematic and iaithiul ivniir
be done on the part of those who
are to compete for representation
at the dual and state meet. Grin-
nellhas been exceptionally strong
in tennis in past years, and the
key to her success has been hard
work. Without thistherc is little
hope or victory. The S. U. 1.
tennis players are busily engaged
in their handicap tournament and

from the number of men out, they
seem to have excellent chances for
capturing the state meet. Let all
tennis players see that the ten I'e-
maiiiiiig \vecks be spent in hard
work.
