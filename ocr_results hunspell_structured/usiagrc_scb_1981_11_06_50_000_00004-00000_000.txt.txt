What sounds good in theory doesn’t always work well in practice.
Gi'inneli may pride itself, in theory, on all of the student imput that
goes into the decisions that are made around here, but in practice that
input isn‘t always solicited. Such is the case with the actions surroun—
ding the decisions made by the Calendar Committee.

The Calendar Committee, as mandated in an Aug. 3 memo to the
faculty from Dean ot‘ the Faculty Catherine Frazer, was charged with
the responsibility of studying the academic calendar and weekly class
schedule. The committee is only temporary and is technically a sub
committee of the Committee on Academic Standing. Math professor
Charles Jeps'en chairs the group which also consists of Dennis Haas,
Chris Hunter and Oda Callison,

What the committees has done already is to change the overall
academic calendar of the college. The new calendar, which will go into
effect next year, is only different with respect to the first semester.
There are still 14 weeks in the semester with a week-long break in Oc-
tober, but there are changes in the New Student Days schedule and
Thanksgiving break.

Next year, New Student Days will run from Saturday, Aug. 21,
through Tuesday the 24th. Registration will take place on Wednesday
the 25th and classes will begin on Thursday, Aug, 26. Beginning classes
in the middle of the week will in turn allow for a real Thanksgiving
break; in this case Thursday, Nov. 25, through Sunday the 28th. The
semester will end with the last class on Saturday, Dec. 11, and finals
will go from Monday through Friday the week of Dec. 13-17.

Now all this isn‘t really that major. As we said, there will be no
changes for the second semester and actually we think that the
changes that were made are kind of nice. But that’s not the point. The
point is that this decision was made by the faculty without ever cone
suiting the students.

Hi gang, remember us, the students? We are the ones who the whole
show is all about. Without us there really wouldn’t be much reason for
getting together.

Jepsen explained that the changes, which were approved by the
faculty at their Oct. 12 meeting, came from suggestions that were ex—
pressed by faculty members in a survey that went out in September.
He pointed out that the committee had to move swiftly because they
had to enact any changes before Oct. 15.

This is all over and done with. The changes have been made and
that’s that. But that's not the case with the weekly class schedule. The
Calendar Committee is just now beginning to start work on finding out
what. if any, changes may be made,

Jepsen explained that one of their goals is to try to distribute the
number of clases more equally over the available time periods. That
means they’re going to be considering things like Saturday morning
and 8 am. classes. ,

Right now the only immediate plans to get students reaction to the
question of revising the weekly class schedule is through the student
members on the Curriculum Committee and through each depart-
ments’ EPC.

It’s probably important to you when classes are scheduled, so we
urge you to make your opinions known to the EPC members in your
department. Let’s try to put some theory into practice.
