Garbo

by Peter Jarol‘l

\vhen Sugarlnnd Express was
released in the spring of '74, it
elicited a good deal of criticism,
both Iavorable and not so
favorable. Based on an actual case
in Texas five years beiore,
Sugul'land Express is the story of a
husband-wife team of petty thieves
(Goldie Hawn and William
Atherton) who lose custody of their
son while serving jail terms.
Determined to retrieve the boy at
any cost, Goldie springs her
husband from prison, kidnaps u
police officer, and touches off a
wild car chase across the state. In
the process. Hawn becnmes a sort
DI folk hero. The other heroes in the
film are Cars~hundreds OI them
swcrving, smashing, speeding and
crashing, The case builds to a
surprising finish after covering
some 300 miles and involving zoo
vehicles,

Most critics praised the
technical expertise and box office
sense of siigarlaiid E.\])ress’s 26
year old director, Steven
Spielberg. and most applauded the
performances of dawn, Atherton.
and cast. After that, however,
there was a ivide range of opinion,
Pauline Kael called the movie ”one
of the most phenomenal debut
films in'the history bf movies.”
Spielberg, in her View, had ”a
knack [or bringing out young ac-
tors, and a sense of composition

irector might envy," Other
or cs. like Stephen Farber (in the
Ne“ York Times)’, found
Sugnrland Express “perfectly
syntheticipure Hollywood from
first frame to last.” Farber
belittled the film as “a social
statement whose only commitment
is to the box office."

Despite its “box ofﬁce comr
mitment," Sugarlaiid Express was
not widely distributed and Soon
faded from the movie pages,
depriving many lilmgoers of a
chance to form their own opinions.
Spielberg’s next film enjoyed more
commercial success, If I recall
Correctly, it had something to do
with a shark out on Long Island or
somewhere.

laughs!

by Bill Waldller

One critic summarized Ninnt»
chka with the phrase “Garbo
laughs!” As notable as that [act
may be, this film has a lot more
than one laughing actress going for
it,

Ninutchka is a sophisticated
comedy and satire of communism
and capitalism, set with Paris as
the background. It stars Melvyn

star personalities in the history of
film. Greta Garbo,

Villntcllka is directed by Ernst
Lubitschr If Garbo ls one of the
greatest star personalities in
Iilm, then Lubitsch can be called
one of the greatest director per-
sonalities in ﬁlm. Lubitsch was an
innovator, the kind of director that
other directors are influenced by.
One oi the best German directors
of the silent era, Lubitsch was the
first of the foreign artists to be
“imported" to Hollywood. He
came to the U.S. in 1923. and by
1929 he was the top director at
Paramount studios. .

At this time, the Hollywood
studios were in the habit of type-
casting their directors as well as
their stars. Some directors were
given the “action" films. while
others were responsible for the
Studio's slapstick comedies. I call
Lubitsch a director personality
because lie quickly became known
as the master of the sophisticated
comedy of manners. His films
were ‘iilitty, “smart,” and risque
ithough' not in any way that the
ever-present Hollywood censor
could put his finger on). Lubitsch's
spicy Continental sense of humor,
as well as his innovative set
designs, his exciting use of camera
movement, and the visual ex-
cellence of his films soon became
his trademark: the."Lubitsch
touch” is what they called it in
Hollywood.

The ‘.‘Lubil5ch touch" and the
Garbo mystique, along with some
hilarious performances by the
supporting cast make Niiiotclika
one of the finest movies of the
thirties.
