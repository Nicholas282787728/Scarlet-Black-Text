Jim Dlnncn’illc, '01, ilskcd if I

assured him I would email him any
additional questions.Turns out
he's in my stats class,

"I didn't know you were in
here," he said apologetically,
"Don't Worry“ 5 ‘ ’I didn't know
you were either,“

He asked again if] needed any
more information and I asked him
if there was anything else he
wanted to say “It's your article,”
he said to me. Suddenly I devel-

going to have to try to write a rep

Dinnerville is best known
throughout campus, perhaps, from
the SGA minutes posted in the
bathroom stalls. Chances are. if
you take time to check the min
utes, they would read- the resolu
tion passed with a vote of 241,
Dinherville (Norris) dissenting.
He is typically known to be the
‘voicc against the majority at SGA
meetings.

Dinnerville’s careerin the SGA
began this year,first semester.

“\thn We Came back from
summer break and got the essen-
tial/nonessential student paper,l
decided I wanted to become an
essential student."And that he be-
came.

Dinnerville dissented on two
key and controversial issues
brought before SGAgWhether
SGA should fund poli cal and re-
ligious activities, and the resolu~
tion passed after the hate crime
against RLC John Mounscy earlier
this year.

He voted against giving fund-
ing to avspecific religious event
partly because the group asked for
funding lifter the event (which is
against SGA policy) but mainly
because he felt that SGA should
not be allowed [q give money to
such an organization.

‘Ididn't want to harm [these] .

groups but to prevent SGA from
supporting any political or reli-
gious group. . ,I don't want SGA to
become the arbiter to all political

and religious discussion on cam-
pus,” said Dinnerville. “Religion,
at the most basic element, is the
relationship between a person
and whoever [they feel] created
them and SGA shouldn’t
interfere. .it wasn’t an attack on
religion but a protest against
funding an individual religion.“

In the case of the resolution
passed after the hate crimes,
Dinnerville once again voted
against the majority.

“I saw it as a way for SGA to
look good in the press—to gain
moral support, The tEsolution
only served to say that SGA equals
good and therefore if you were
against SGA you were had," said
Dinnerville, -

In fact, he has formed a com-
mittee with the speciﬁc purpose
of determining SGA‘s role in fund-
ing campus activities,

“...SGA should be formed
more in self governance.and
should be designed to work with
student groups but not work for
student groups. ..I've made state-
ments that] want SGA to be more
of an assembly-type
government, the typeweshould
have if we go around talking
about self-governance,"
Dinnerville’s specific views about
representation are the basis for
his argument.

“When you represent some-
one you take their right to repre-
sent themselves," explained
Dinnerville. "I want to involve the

government...I've been known (0
say good government governs itself,
SGA has tried to become the center
of campus culture or spirit and I've
tried to oppose it."

One of his main problems with
SGA is the way they get information
from students,

“When they try to decide what
students want, they don't go to the
students,but to the clubs and Couli-
tions. But the clubs and coalitions
don't always reﬂect students‘ opine
ions at large. . .When you’re actually
involved [in SGA] it's very much of
a one-party system mentalityihow
do we do this to make us look bet»
ter?" said Dinnerville.

Speaking about his committee,
Dinnerville added,'I don‘t like com-
mittees and I don't like groups, but
I think this is the best way to go
about i ...When we think about
changes we think about how it
would be different from now—not
if it's better than now There are no
problems in a larger assembly [style
SGA] that couldn't be worked out."

Dinnerville was running for re-
election yesterday, so residents of
Norris Hall have already made their
decision on his performance. He ran
unopposed ﬁrst semester, but he
was pleased to have competition
this time. On whether you, fair
reader, believe in his modvations and
actions, I guess Jim Dinnerville
would just tell you to make up your
own mind—and pay no heed to the
majority opinion.

Serenading Sweethearts
Grinnell Singers fundraise for fun

DY EMILY LARSON

Undaunted bv the looming task
of raising an estimated 560,000 for
an the seas tour,the Grinnell Singe
ers have begun fund raising with
SingingValcntines.Forfourdollars,
a group ofthree of root singers will
serenade your sweetheart, singing
such stand by “It Had to Bchu"
this st Valentine's Day.

\Vc' c had one request for the
liarncy Song" said student orga-
nizer Pat O'NL ,‘OI, “Iiut generv
ally we're not taking requests,"

Since the liging Valentines
fundraiser is estimated to raise only
around It htlndrcd dollars for the
trip, one of the main objectives of
the group is to simply raise aware-
ness of the cause to the Gnnnell
community and spur future sup-
port

The task of ﬁnding money to
fund an lntc iiitional tour is not
new to the Gginnell Singers, Dr
rcctotjohn Christian Rommcreim
has been trying to organize an in-
ternational tour for the group for
many years.

“This IS Something that I've
wanted to do ct‘cr since I came
here ten years ago," said
llonuncrcim

Mam propos: s [of trip funding
have bc n sulnnittetl,with little re-

sponse to the succession ofptesie
dents receiving them.

The latest of such proposals
was submitted last year as part of
a“Experiential Learning” Fund for
Excellence group proposal,
which included study tours and
off campus study events, This
proposal sought funding for an
international tour every four
years, which would have-begun
this year with an international
competition in Budapest

However, response was mini-
mal,and no comparable compe-
titions were offered during spring
break of 2000. The Singers are
now looking at a tour of the Bﬂle
tic Republic for spring break next
you

This is due in part to contacts
that the group has established
with it Finnish choir Which per-
formed at Grinnell last semester

These contacts would give the
choir an opportunity to meet
with and hear several other
choirs in such are s as Finland
and 5t Pctersburg, .. well as stay
in homes and Cut down on travel
expenses,

Making the proposed trip
more than ”just 11 fun thing.”
Rummcrclm l )ccn working to
lnzlkc an educational experience
out ofthc trip

By having a Russian History ex-
pert travel with the choir, giving lec-
tures of the region and assigning
reading. Rommereim hopes for the
trip to bea learning experience that
will reward the students with two
credit hours at Grinncll,

Besides providing educational
opportunities for students,
Rommercim hopes that the trip will
beneﬁt Grinnell College by reptce
sentation internationally, as well as
by strengthening the music program

“International tours have be
come pretty much standard in col-
lege choirs," he said, Rommcreim
feels that such tours are necessary
to attract talented and serious sing»
ers to Gtinnell

Although the overseas trip is one
of the main priorities for the Sims
ers,thcy are currently preparing for
their domestic tour over this spring
break.

For nine days, the 55 Singers arc

going to be touring the country, '

making stops in icago, Kentucky,
Tennessee,At1;lnta, North Carolina,
Virginia, and Washington Dc.

The next fund raising event the
singers have planned is a Cabaret
Night, scheduled for February 21,
which will feature members of the
choir displaying iheirnumerous and
entertaining talents.

you don‘t see anyone you know in front of you),

Waiting lines are so common at Grinnell that we almost take them

everyone has heard stories of the dinner line moving backwards due to
rampant cutting, though few have actually witnessed such an event
(but lines which don't move because of cutters is a common occur-
rence). .

Waiting in line to eat isn’t all that bad, because you know that you
will eventually make it into the dining hall.A bigger problem occurs in
those situations where waiting in line does not guarantee that you will
get what you want The recent rush for tickets to Swan Lalce is a prime
example. Marcy Brant ‘02 was one of the unfortunate students who
waited in vain

“I had a feeling we got there too late," said Brant.“We got there at
twenty to five, and it opened at 0,1 was probably about 50 people
away when they sold out,I didn'teven see who got the last ticket."

Although disappointed about missing the ballet, Brant isn’t too an;

there first,you get in."

The’"get there first" philosophy has caused brought the camping

a few hearty souls are always willing to go the extra mile to ensure they
get what they‘re after.“ Registration was scary, the fact that people slept
outside for the night," lid Brunt.

Jeff Zdunek >01 spent the better part of his Saturday waiting in line

“We got’there at 9:00 a.m,,and it opened at 2:00," said Zdunek,“vl/e

closed out of the class.

see the system as totally fair, saying that the class spaces just go to “th

Cowles Dining Hall begins to fill with hungry

tudents before each meal, and the resulting lines
tend to stretch on well into the evening Daily
waiting aside, Grinnellians have faced many
additional frustrations to try their patience,
including regiStration day crowds at the
beginning of the semester and a recent line for
Russian Bulleti tickets. Though some view the
system as archaic and unfair; the lines could be
a blessing in disguise, giving students a taste of
real-life crowding and challenging their ability
to remain calm dndpdtt‘ent in tight situations.
“In the end,” writes Phdm, "waiting in line does
serve a purpose: it makes us appreciate whatever
it was that we waitedfor all the more. Think of
that next time you're waiting to eat at Cowles,
Or; you could just out."
