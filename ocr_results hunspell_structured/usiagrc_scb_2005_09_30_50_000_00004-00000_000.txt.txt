Neverland Players
take a break from
adulthood this
weekend at the Wall

BY SARAH MlRK

An alien speaks in symbols and squiggles.
Someone “breathes like a sick cow." A girl ﬂies
to Costa Rice on an eagle's back.

The Neverland Players, the student-run
theater troupe that is performing for the third
consecutive semester, seeks fresh perspectives
at every step of the creative process, beginning
with the playwrights.

At the beginning of the semester, Director
Knt Henry’06 heads over to Davis Elementary
School and asks the 3rd and 4th grade teachers
to have their students write short stories about
anything they want.

She and the Neverland cast then adapt the
short stories to stage and create a zany hours
long performance made up of 20 short scenes.
“It’s amazing the variety of writing styles and
the range of writing ability of the kids,” Henry
said. “Some of the stories arejiist five sentences,
live facts about a person, but there’s humor in
them. They’re brilliant in their own way."

In adapting the stories, the east tries to do
away with character stereotypes while creating
distinct and funny personalities. “These kids are
exposed to nothing but classic archetypes," said
Henry,

Rachel Fields ’09, who performs as a hunch—
hack, a prince and an Italian mobster cat enjoys
working with the grade school playwrights.
“Little kids have the best imaginations, so they
write the best stories," Fields said.

Kid theater also gives the student cast a break
from more serious productions. Back in the bye
gone days ofher freshman year, says Henry, the
theater scene at Grinnell was not a healthy one.

“Every main stage show was absolutely de-
pressing] would ﬁnish rehearsal and I would
cry," she said. Now, Henry is handing out Vale
entines and Hershey’s Kisses to every cast mem—
her.

Fields was intimidated by the idea of trying
out for the main stage show and is glad she’s
found a place in the “casual and low-key" Nev-
erland Players.

To her, performing in the show feels more
like a “group of friends putting something to
gether rather than being a bunch of very seri-
ous actors.”As writers, choreographers, costume
designers and, ﬁnally, performers, the Neverland
cast has to work together in what could be a
grueling, stressful experience.

instead, “we lan h so hard we cry every
night," Henry said. “‘ his particular group is just
amazing. They’re not the people you see in the
loggia and are like, ‘they obviously do theater;
They’re very humble people and they're not
hams.”

Henry hopes that the casts' energy and fun
will spread to the audience and improve the
mental wellbeing of the campus.

The Neverland production moves at a dize
zyirig pace; the ﬁnal show is made up of 20 dife
ferent stories, all adapted, cast, memorized and
costumed in under one month. A few days be-
fore opening night, Henry said that that all that
is left it to do is “scw everything together and
add music."

As the man behind the Neverland piano
since the group began, Ben Kim ‘09 said that
the repertoire {or this semester includes televie
sion theme songs as won as a rendition of co-
car/15mm.

"I try to play music that’s as cliche as pos-
sible," Kim said. While this philosophy would
probably make most music majors cringe, Kim
is aiming his tunes at a different audience: the
elementary school kids who fill the Wall for the
ﬁlial performance.

The Neverland Players will be performing in
The Will] in Bucksbaum Center for the Arts on
Friday at 7 pm, Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and
Sunday at 2 pm.

Artist installs work in R0

Bv EMlLIA CARVEY
When students first moved into East Campus a
few years ago, they complained of the sterile environ-

ment, the overwhelming smell ofpaint and the hotels -

like feeling ofthc widc hallways.

Students weren’t the only ones who thought so.
When the trustees arrived for the opening ceremonies
for the new dorm, they found something lacking as
well. “When the dorms opened," said Lesley Wright,
director of the Faulconer Gallery, “the trustees said,
‘Wouidn't it be nice to have some art in here?”

Wright suggested sally Kuzrna, an artist she knew.
Kuzma’s “Soybean Rotations" piece was featured in
the Faulconer’s Rmm of Renewal exhibit in Fall 2003.
Kuzma had also done public installations called "Says
bean Generations"and "Corn Rotations"at a Univers
slry ofNorthern Iowa dining hall.

Though these titles may sound like headings or. a
local radio farm report, Kuzma's work is nothing oldie
nary. Her technique, which she has used in all ofthese
pieces, involves scanning common crops or seeds and
digimlly reworking them.

In her work for Rose Hall, she cropped images of
corn, inverted their color and layered and rotated the
image into kaleidoscopic patterns. Then she printed
them and sandwiched them between Plexiglas tiles.

At ﬁrst, Kuzmn found the m'ldwestern landscape
foreign and strange. Her surprising fascination with
plant life began when she moved to Iowa as an adult
after living in New York City.

“it felt very alien to me, and I was deeply curious
about what else lived here," Kuzma said.

Though her Rose Hall installation is rooted in the
form, it also relates to specifically Grinnellian imag-
ery. As Wright said, it references the Louis Sullivan
Bank, with a semiscircular “mandala"puttern over the
lounge doorway that resembles a rising sun. Sullivan
worked to integrate oiganic detail into geometric
shapes, and now Kuzmn manipulates organic matter
to be morc geometric.

“The college also has a sense ofcuriosity and cons
nection with the world as a whole," said Kuzma. Her
manipulation oforganic matter can be seen as a refer-
ence to the advent ofgcnctic engineering.

“The manipulation of sccd has developed cons
notations both wondrous and monstrous, even infec—
nous," said Kuzma in her proposal for this project.

The project went through many phases in plan-
ning. Kuzma first suggested stenciling spiral sccd
patterns onto the wall, but, she said, "The wall needs
to be cleaned and repainted periodically and it really
wouldn’t be practical to re-do the installation every
couple ofycars."

Printed images sandwiched between more easily
cleaned Plexiglas tiles were chosen instead, for their
durability. Layout plans had to be reworked again be-

causc oflines caused by expansion joints in the walls.
“Sally had to rework the piece to work around that
break,” said Wright. "“She's been really great about
practicality, which is what you want in an artist in-
stalling a public workr’“

Kuzma and two college carpenters worked on in
smiling the piece on Wednesday and Thursday After
spending four hours figuring out how to work around
the second ﬂoor kitchen balcony, they spent the rcst
otthc day putting up tilcs, and completered about half
ofthem up before an 8 pm. study break.

On Wednesday night, students, teachers, and
administrators gathered to talk to anma about the
place. They crowded the lobby stairs and ate brown-
ies.

“Hopefully students will take care of it and show
it off to people,” Billy Kennedy, East Campus RLC
said.

HSC Julie Edwards ’07 hoped that 'it would set a
precedent for more artwork in dorms. “People are ale
Wliys complaining about how sterile and boring East
campus is,"she said.

“This is good because hopefully we’ll be able to
get art for the other dorms, It would be really good if
it was student artwork,"

“This installation has set a precedent for Grinnell
College," said Lesley Wright. “The more we can work
with artists, the more we can activate spaces in intere
csting ways.”
