Pub Opening Possible

by Rick Lancaster

J.E. Grinnell's vision of a dry
campus may go up in a cloud oi
hops in the near future, Contrary
to the spirit in which the late J.B.
founded this community, Grinnell
College is scheduled to open its
new pub sometime soon--possibly
this weekend. Located next to Gard,
ner lounge in the basement oi Main
Hall, the pub will be run by manar
ger Mark Nissan according to gain
delines set iorth last year by the
Board of Trustees.

Thus far, managing the establish,
ment of the pub has been a study
in hassles. Plumbers have been
kept so busy in town lately that
the plumbing, aii assuredly essen—
tial item, has Still to be installed.
The electrician is having problems
driving screws into the newly-dis—
covered steel plate under the plas-
ter in Gardner. Furthermore, says
Nissen, the ﬂour is crooked which
is a problem it the bar is to be
level. All this has postponed 'the
pubs tentative opening date irom
today to sometime later this month.
At the latest, the pub will be ready
for the alumni at Alumni Weekends
in early October.

Despite these hangrups Nissen and
the pub’s board of directors have

made some doiinite plans ior how
the pub will be operated. Hours
Monday through Saturday will be
from 4 pm, to closing with the
other hall—dozen taverns in town at
2 a.m. There will be no hours on
Sunday. No one who is under in
will be admitted to drink beer (the
only drink the pub is licensed for).
The establishment willbe legally de-
fined as a non—prom private club.
Membership is restricted to memb»
ers oi the college community who
pay the $2 (per year) membership
fee. Beer will be sold only to meme
bers at a Cost oi 30c ior a mug and
$1.25 {or a pitcher. Soft drinks will
go at 156 each.

0n the pubs chances for success,
Nissen was candidly optimistic. Ba-
sed on a projection olmaking an op—
timum take, the college’s $7,000
commercial loan may be repaid in
as little as 18 months: After that,
says Nissen, “II business goes as
well as I think it will, we'll be look»
ing ior ways to give money away.”
Probably that will take the form of
free mugs, contests, drawings, or
any other way in which to maintain
the business’ standing as a non-
profit organization.

Those behind the new pub envision
it more as a social gathering place

than as a brawling iunhouse. Along
this line it could become a Cozy
place for students to chat with prois
over a beer alter classes. Shouldn’t
this place have aname, then? “We’ll
leave that to other people, Maybe
through a contest or something,”
smiles Nissen.

li by chance there should be some
trouble, the manager, like any other
proprietor, will take recourse with
the police. There is general conii»
dence in the pub's clientele, though.
“I really believe in students atGrin-
nell. I think they can handle theme
selves."

And the controversial state liquor
inspectors? They and Chiei Peters
may stop by “a couple oi times”
this semester mainly to Check on
underrage people. Pub operators are

‘ expected to cooperate iully with local
law enforcers.

Those who dropped by Gardner this
past week to check things outwere
probably disappointed to iind the ac-
coutrements still in a primitive
state: plywood bar uniinished, signs
oi interrupted carpentry and wiring
lying about. But soon, ii all goes
well, Grinnell College students will
be able to drink to LB. Grinnell's
memory in their own public house.

I. B. Advocates Prohibition

by Brent Schondelmeyer

in that now iniamous quote, P ’es-
ident Glenn Leggett told a mean,
dering Wall Street Journal report—
er last year, ”Booze is back, and
back big.”

Strike up the band, roll out the
beer, come West young man!

in his autobiography, Reminisc-
ences of Forty Years, Josiah Bush-
nell Grinnell discussed some of the
motivating {actors and aspirations
in coming West.

“To found a temperance town in
the West was a cherished aspira-
tion on leaving New York in 1854.
None were wanted as neighbors who
would tolerate a saloon. In fact
they were repelled with decision,
if not rudeness, while there was a
warm welcome to a large Class
who came here to escape tempta-
tion in a struggle for reformation.”
In his Utopia inception of the town,

orinnell had plans tor a visionary
university. When the Trustees oi
lowa College in Davenport decided
to leave the rough rivertown, whose
temptations detracted from the schr
olarly pursuits and piety oi the sine
dents, Grinnell was able to attract
them to his railroad town in 1858.
The college catalogue during these
early years advertised the college
by saying --

Grinnell. the location of Grinnell
College, is iamous ior its natural
beauty and tor the morality of
its people. lt has never had a
saloon, and other evil inﬂuences
are proportionately scarce.

dent spirits were not sold thereon

sent or that oi my legal represent-
atives.” Contained in the warranty

the courts would uphold such a pro
viso citing a case brought up in
Greely, Colorado wherethe Supreme
Court had upheld a similar pro-
vision in an unanimous decision,

Though a strict prohibitionist Gri-
nnell conceded that he had on occ-
asion consumed alcoholic beveras
ges.

“Most oi the public men at that
time drank beer. It was on the
dinner table, and members called for
it to treat lriends without regard
to time and ceremony. l drank it,
soon overcoming an aversion to its
bitter taste, The lager was not
deemed intoxicating, but hop, with
flavor, a welcome tonic. It was
only by age and- excessive use that
clients were Visible.”

The lowa country seemed to nur-
ture Grinnell’s Views on prohibi-
tion and he was elected to the
state senate in 1858 on a no sa-
loon plank. As his notoriety grew,
Grinnell became in high demand
as a speaker on the subject of
prohibition. On many occasions he
would tell his audience ~-

”Drinking usuages cost more than
bread, Drunkeness is the prolific
mother oi criminals, and it has a
death-roll of victims greater than
that charged to the other two grim
angels oi destruction -— disease
and war, Can there be an excuse,
then, ior indiiierence or ior sia
lance?”

He noted that the 55 loot double-
bottorn truck bill, in which ISPIRG
has been pitted against an extreme
ly intense lobbying eiiort by the
trucking industry andthe Teamsters
Union, was stalled in the last ses
sion at the legislature.

Outlaw No - Returns

In addition, ISPIRG efforts have
brought statewide attention toaprOr
posed measure that would outlaw
all noncreturnable beverage con-
tainers in lowa.

Although the hill spent the bulk
of the last session stalled in the
House Natural Resources Commi-
ttee, a massive lobbying eiiort
spearheaded by a group ot Grinnell
students brought the bill to the floor
shortly beiore adjournment

The bill is pending beiore the up
coming session, and Laitner noted
that he “expects passage in some
form, hopefully intact, sometime
this session,”

Palmer and Laitner analyzed the
lowa Legislature as being “at least
more moderate” than previous ass,
emblies have been, '

“In environmental issues, they
sure as hell aren't (more liberal),
When you look at the appropriation
the House tried to pass for the De—
partment oi Environmental Quality
it was only 75 up oi the Governor’s
recommended budget. The Senate
didn’t allow that to stand, but on
environmental issues l‘dsaythey’re
as conservative as ever," Laitner
said.

However, both noted that a trend
towards younger, and more liberal
legislators did appear to be devel-
oping. The deieat oi ten incum-
bents who hold key House positions
would markedly alter the complex-
ion oi the legislature, they ielt.

Students: Lethargy

ved than were their counterparts
in the late Sixties.

“We're going back to the bubble
gum and rock and roll attitudes
oi the Fifties,” Laitner noted. How
ever, he added that the ”hard core
of concerned, active Students” was
larger than the corresponding group
of that period. This is leading to
more responsible social reiorms.

Recruiting will be an urgent priora
ity ior groups like lSPlRG ii they
are to survive, they noted. How-
ever, they noted that ISPIRG has
several strong inducements that can
be used in recruiting students for
lobbying and research work, y

Many schools are now granting »
credit for work done under ISPIRG
in the Iowa Legislature. Others are
changing course materials to re»
Ilect ISPIRG type issues.

“in this area, many of the pro-
iessors are ahead of the students,"
Laitner noted. However, he expres-
sed confidence that there are enough
concerned students to actively work
in lSPIRG programs.

Palmer noted that many students
will provide iinancial support, al»
though they are unwilling or unable
to give time to the group. Both
types are needed, He expressed
hope that there would be a number
oi students willing to give three
to iive hours on a regular, weekly
basis to lSPIRG projects.

One such eiiort, which Palmer
irelerred to as “survival project,”
involves a monthly issue developed
by the Nader organization in Wash-
ington. Each issue is suitable tor.
a briei, intense study by non-ex-
perts.

Results DI the studies Will be ga-
thered and compiled as the basis
for formulating model legislation
and proposed solutions to problems

Asked what the mayor issue tor
the coming year would be, Palmer
simply replied “energy," lie ex—
plained that ISPIRG's number one
priority will probably involve rae ,
ising the energy conservation in-.
stlncts oi lowans while lobbying
for a ”rational energy program
(or the entire state."
