Iowa City particularly excelled on

The excellent torin displayed by

Carl Rotilfuss of Des Moincs act-

Mr. Coll‘dcn of Griiinell as third

but his services were noti-equlred.
After the contest, :l conference
was held by (lil'ectOls Bailey of

Next Friday, March 29. the Glee
Club will go to Eldora \vhcre they
will turnish music tor the high
school contest which is to beheld
there. on Saturday they will be
joined by the orchestra and the
two will give a concert in the even-
ing. This will be: the only out-of—

town concert given by these organs
izations this year.

On Thursday, April 4, the Glee
Club and Orchestra will givca con-
ccrt to the teachers attending tllc
teachers’ association in this city.

The Glee Club will doubtless
keep in training the remainder ot
the year totake their usual part in
the Commencement exercises in
June.

The Eutcrpe Club will not give
any outrof-town concerts this year,
being somewhat hampered be:
cause of its short existence, in not
having a program suitable tor such
an undertaking. By next year
they hope to have an evening at
their own fora concert, and will
also bi: in a position to give Cons
certsotilottown. Thcytvill,llowr
ever, continue practicing and take
part in the Commencement music.
