A moment of prayer. .
and goats and ganja

by Ethan L‘nheli

Let’s take a moment from the
normal drudgery oi the 8&1; for a
short prayer:

“0h Given Diety x.

Please save us from the \vonkr
headed conservative geeks Love.
hugs and kisses.

Us Folks"

Perhaps you're oiieiided by a
prayer appearing in your school
newspaper, Perhaps you feel you
have a right to read in peace
Well. you don't, this is the
editorial page, Ha‘ You might
think that there are places where
you can be iree irom the opium or
religion. Well you’re wrong again.
It's a new era. Hysterical minori-
ty fringe elements rule the day
Before you write this off as a bit of
hysterical reaction imelf, think
about one thing: who really wants
prayer in school? Do kids want

prayer in School? or course they
do! I always see kids on the street
running around praying wildly,
Parents are constantly scolding
their children ior praying too
much and neglecting their school
work I heard that a lot from my
parents Kids squirm a lot in
churcii or temple Why? It‘s
because they are praying so hard
their muscles begin to convulse.

. what I can't understand is why
kids can't pray beiore they go to
school or during lunch, I guess it's
just like going to the bathroom.
sometimes you forget to go before
you leave home, Maybe they could
put in prayer rooms next to the
bathrooms or course in large
cities kids would be'atraid to use
the prayer rooms, They might get
stopped by ivloonies or Krishnas
and be forced to buy little tlowers
with their lunch money.

Andrew i‘aul might not feel that
prayer rooms are necessary. In
The Outcry. Andy gavc voice to a
neat idea of his: have a minute of
silent prayer belore class. I'm not
sure how kids of mine would feel
about that it they're anything like
me, a minute will be far too long a
period to devote to silence, Will
my kids be allovied to use their
minute to discuss baseball. or the
size oi their goats? No! Silciit they
will remain. {or all the other

there are some teachers who

‘Quoth the Raymond’

by Jon itajinond

Ladies and gentlemen. i am just
Sick over this busmess uith those
Chicago Cubs

Aiter is years oi getting exactly
what they deserved. the Flubs
have gone and put themselves in
the National League Playoirs
against the San Diego Padres and
their John Birch Society pitching
stall, As a lifelong Cardinals Ian
who knows all too well the horrors
of the Cubs and their fans, I
assure you that this development
is, in fact. tragic,

Most people simply do not
realize the magnitude or this
heinous happening. Here. then, is
a warning to those oi you lucky
enough to have avoided Cubness
until now,

First, prepare yourseli for
media overkill on Wrigley Field
and its environs. Wrigley, a nice
little minor league park. suiiers
irom being placed in a major
league city. Mentally dericient
Cub fans have confused it for be»
ing “quaint" or having
“character."

Bull. Wrigley is too small, trafr
hc around it is impossible to
manage, the outfield wall catches
more balls in its ivy than Cub out»
Iielders catch in their gloves and
there are 7 get this — no lights in
the park.

Cub fans say that “real
baseball" takes place only in
daylight. This argument makes as
much sense as saying "real" sex
takes place only at night Many

people also say that natural grass
makes baseball more "real." Of
course, many or these same peo-
ple don‘t mind the designated hit-
ter rule. so they may as well
become hockey ians and avoid
baseball discussions altogether.

To use a little warped Cub logic,
one might say that real baseball
stadiums should not be named (or
chewing gum companies but in
stead ior beer companies. ln iact.
one oi my iavorite stadiums is
named tor a beer company.

Another. iar more insidious pros
blem, involves the Cub fans. Do
you remember how you ielt Wat»
ching the hundreds of iranians
celebrating in the streets or
Tehran aiter seizing the us, em-
bassy‘.’ Cub fans will make you
feel worse.

I remember when I first started
hating both the Cubs and their ob-
noxious ians. l was sitting in a box
seat at Busch Stadium for the first
time. i was really feeling great.
rooting {or my Birds and enjoying
the Wide open spaces oi the Busch
field boxes,

According to custom. many Cub
tans made the trip to St, Louis to
_ ‘ ’lie weekend series. I noticed
one particular Cub ran sitting just
behind me. rapidly stuiiing iood
into her big mouth and stopping
just long enough to ring a silly
cowbell and yell things like, “Go.
Santo! Hey, Pepitone!” A
loathing was born,

Finally, you are certain to hear
things about ”Phillics West"

beiore the postseason is over.
This expression describes what
happened when a man named Jim
rinks decided a couple oi years
ago to hire a winning baseball
team

rinks obtained a rellovi named
Dallas Green to build a winner in
Chicago, iKnoWing what you do
about the Cowboys. how can you
We a man named Dallas?)
ironically, Green had just put the
Philadelphia Phillies into the
World Series tor the ﬁrst time
since 1950.

Green subsequently hired much
or the talent he had won the World
Series in Philadelphia with and
put them to work in Chicago. Now
they are ivinning in Wrigley Field
and making the obnoxious Cub
ians very happy.

ir Green's team wins again in
Chicago this year. can you im»
agine how much money he and his
rentra~pennant players will be
able to get ror winning games ior
Seattle or Cleveland?

Now you have been warned. The
runny little park. the awiul iaiis
and the hired guns will be with you
until the Flubs are beaten back to
reality by another playoii team, 1
suggest becoming a tootball ian
until then.

Q: what are the two best things
to ever come out oi Chicago?
A: Lou Brook and Bruce Sutter.

by Mike Cleary

Most or us have grown up in a
culture which taboos socialist
ideas Consequently, there are
many misconceptions oi this
ideology

We socialists want to explain
the tenets til-our philosophy This
will clear up misunderstanding
and answer questions about
socialism

Socialists believe. Iirst of all, in
democratic. egalitarian society.
other societies ignore minority
concerns and thus lose their 0pc
portunity to make a better life for
everyone. Democratic society
seeks the good at all by hearing
out all interests. Democracy
necessarily implies equality, As
long as some people are denied
their legal and civil rights
everyone is threatened. The
privileged could press their ad-
vantage at any suitable time.

A society which rosters com-
petitiveness encourages this
behavior. in competitive society,
the advantaged maintain their
position by thrtﬁt, in one iorm or
another. community and the
public good lose out as the self»
interested individual gains. Com-
petition can set people against
each other in pursuit oi a common
goal.

This is why socialists advocate
cooperation Cooperation brings
people together and deiends
against the temptation to take ad
vantage oi others, Cooperative
people recognize the value and
strength of others and try to unite
them towards a common goal.
Thu socialists champion
ieminism and civil rights.

Most 01 all, socialists want [0
enable the people to use power No
society is any better than the peo-
ple who compose it No govern
ment can makepeople iree ir the
people do not will it. For the pear
pie to control their own lives, they
need participatory democracy.
They must be their own govern-
ment as much as possible, This re-
quires everyone to think and be
responsible citizens, Prejudlca
and immaturity must be
eradicated. Cooperation and
equality have their role to play.

But chieﬂy, it depends on a tune
damentalchange in everyone'satr
titudes; we must all want to
govern ourselves. Socialists are
committed to developing that
mass movement. This is the only
way oi realizing the best society.

while periection can never be
attained, socialists seek to realize
the ideal as closely as possible.
Everyone should. The less we con-
trol our lives, the less‘we have
democracy.

The same is true of our
economic system. Capitalists
have power with which they con-
trol others. it may be impersonal
and indirect. but it is power.

In all things, the capitalist seeks
his own proiit over others in-
terests. The worker depends on
the capitalist who employs him
and sets the terms OI his work A

George had been running troni rolling waiermelona all day and

never even row that the doorway had been ﬁlled with lapiocn pud.

job means liie to many. It used to
be, it the worker protested work
ing conditions, the employer
found someone else. Now, unions
provide some degree of counter
force. But the Capitalists can fire
any worker to keep prolits high.
They can close any plant, They
will sacriiice regional economies
for their beneiit, as happened in
the Pittsburgh steel industry.

Consumers have to take what ‘

the capitalist gives them. They
have little recourse ii they are not
satisﬁed. And, the capitalist can
always create consumer needs.

Capitalism gave generously
when it had the resources Now
that we iace limits and grave
danger to the environment, our
consumption patterns must
change, But corporations continue
to despoil the environment and
take raw materials to make things
to which they addict consumers.

We face unemployment, poverr
ty, ecological catastrophe. and
many other problems. We can
work theseout. For years we have
trusted the proiit motive to get
things done right. The situation
hasn't even improved, Capitalism
won't solve these problems. We
must try another way.

The iirst step is to take power
away rrom those who used it me
tairly and put it to use for
everyone. Economic democracy
must replace capitalism. Then we
can organize production tor the
public 00d, Concretely, this
means: ) Public ownership or
utilities and other monopolies,
and it Joint control of business by
consumers. workers and
managers Cooperation at the
coriimunity level is essential.
Cooperat ‘es would be encourage
ed. ‘ ‘

Second. planning the economy
will ensure that necessities of life
are produced. These include food.
shelter. health care, education,
cultural opportunities and social
services, Whatever private in
itiative does not cover will not be
neglected.

Socialism is not a distant
bureaucracy, welrare state. or up
pressive centralized government.
Socialist government takes
responsibility ior those who can-
not help themselves, We value
community seltrgovernment as
the means ior creating a truly
democratic Society.

We want people to govern
themselves. in an active par-
ticipatory democracy, responsi-
ble people can create the most
ideal society. when their
economic system doesn’t divide
them, they can do even better.

True democracy is our goal. We
must reaffirm the value and
equality oi every man. woman,
and child Our current economic
system degrades people and
elevates others by uniairly
distributing economic power
Replacing capitalism with
economic democracy and nurtur»
ing responsible citizens
everywhere are the steps which
bring us to our goal.
