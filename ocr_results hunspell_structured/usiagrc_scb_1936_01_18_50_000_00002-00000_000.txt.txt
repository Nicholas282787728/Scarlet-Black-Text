.AND WHY NOT"!

Have you ever waited for college ventral
to answer? Have you then found that you
could hardly hear the party to whom you in it»
ed to tall " If you have. then you can reali e
the poor condition ili which the, rolleze tele-
phone tem is.

The most notorious example of a poor tel-
ephone connection is in the journalism depart-
litClit. This phone is probably one or thr most
fretﬁ‘lelﬁly used ones on the campus with the
9 option of those in the deails’ and other all-
iuinistl'atil'e offices.

Yet it is nearly impossible to talk to any-
one, over the journalism telephone. People arr
accused of heing rude when talking from the
journalism room when they are only trying to
hear and be heard, and as a result. almost have
to shout into the mouthpiece. Countless atr
tempts have been made to repair the phone. lint
the net re ilts have been zero. Why, then. f“ li-
uot a new telephone he installed? The cost
should not be prohibitive and there is hardly a

plare where the telephone could be more prof-
iialily installed.

And why not a general overhauling of the
existing college system, with adequate rrplacc.

USELESS ACTION,

The recent hanging of the six supreme
court judges in effigy at Amos, Iowa, sup-
posedly by college students can only be con-
tlemnvd by the uulil'ejudieetL straight-thinking
college prose.

Impartial observers, llolh Democratic and
Republican. and both picg re and museum.
live, have agreed ‘lhat such an attack upon a
nonrpolitical unit ot our government as the
Supreme court is not only ‘inkAlneriean but
treasoimlilc as \\ ell.

Such statements as that mallc by tho presi-
dent in his 1932 rampaign in regard to the
Slllpl'eme com-t its a political body are those
which have led to such all action. Sucli statbr
"tents made by New Dealers that the Supreme
court l'avors the vested interests in this month
try which arr, supposedly represented by the
Repulllican presidents From 1920 to 1932 are
wrong. They ran be refuted when we stop to
realize that two of the tlire dissenting judges,
Brandeis and Cardozo. wore appointed by
Presidents Coolidge and llnovci‘, respectively.

Tho Snprrmn court found the Agricultural
Adjustment Act uneon titutional, but we hold
that illev honestly l7(‘ \‘vd that it violated
1hr 110llCY’S of th national government as set
forth iii our basic law. “‘0 do not. believe
that they were watering to any cla, . 0' group.

The nnprcjdnieod and ulnar-thinking: peth

plv of this country resent the attacks of poli-

‘tit-ians upon the Supreme court, and such ari-

tioli gains nothing. J. N.
