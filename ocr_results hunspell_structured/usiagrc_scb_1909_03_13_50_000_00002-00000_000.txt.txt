day Hunting in Defense of (l Lil)-

cl'al Education.

The students were treated to n spleir
did deteiise of the liberal education
yesterday morning, when President
Main made an address hgainst the idea
oi “education {or a ihnrltet value."
The talk was a reintation or the argu-
ments of a prominent railroad presi-
dent ill a chapel address before the
students or a well known technicalWWW
college.

The words or this railway lhan, Pres
ident Finley, were based on the theme
that success consisted in having a high
“market value" and that education was
successful only as it raised this value
President hlaln took issue With this
view and shoued the uarrowness of
such a standpoint. According to .\ir.
Finleys definition or success the men
whose roiitcrrarr we hhre liccn recent
lr telehrdtin Milton. Darwin, Poe.
‘ellmsoll and LillcolllAWel’c utter (Alb
urc . They uero loited to wait until
the broad foundation they llitll lnid he
gall to iii-ins; them to the trout. The
modem "world's painrl is the con
tiniial n- in; toward liuninass truihin;
and away from a liberal education, and
the \\‘nl'sllilllllg‘ or those who have
achieved lligll inul: lJy (lain; the op
nosite.

Plositlellt .\ rin liroueht out the fort
that the real prnt r-al education is
that which derolo - the mental int-ul-
ties to their highest capacity and
showed that title success is achieved
in inverse proportion to the oit'ort
inndc to gain a “market value"
