Animals in crisis

By India Weston

Animal Rights Coalition Speaker
and formereditorofAnimuIrAgenda,
Wayne Pacelle, presented a very in-
formative plea on behalf of animals
and their rights lastWednesday night.

Pacelle represents Fund For Ante
mals, an animal—rights organization
established in 1967, which has over
two hundred million members.
Pacelle stated that it was the
organization’s “singchminded con-
cern for animals" which made it we
cessful.

Pacelle called for “ethical expan»
sionism," mming expansion outside
of human rights to include the rights
of “non-human animals." “Humans
are animals,” he stated, although the
two are notoflen equated. Usingplea-
sure and pain as major factors in his
support for animal rights, Pacelle
stated that animals deserve “basic
respect” and just treatment.

Pacelle also made the point that
hunting is no longer necessary to sure
vive, citing the fact that 93% of the
public chooses not to hunt, that most
people do not wear furs. and that
many people practice a vegetarian
diet “We can behealtliy without eon»
suming animal products,” he said

Pacelle stated that the rights of
animals are violated in rodeos and
zoos. “We’ve commoditized them,”
he said, He gave recreational activi-
ties such as dogfights as another ex-
ample. Pacelle stated that pit bulls are
chosen for dogﬁghts because people
feel that that particular animal can
“handle it."

Pacelle then spoke of the “abuses

ofihe land.“With 99% of the prairies
and 70% of the forests gone, animals
have lost their homes, Much of the
remainingland hasbccninfestedwith
pesticides. But nothing more impor-
tant can be done for animals, Pacellc
argued, than for humans to stop eat-
ing them.

This was not the reason Pacelle
himself became a vegetarian, how~
ever; he did so “as an environmental
issue." Promotion of the four food
groups is a ”way to promote certain
industries," said Pacellc. “[l-lumans]
don‘t need to consume animal prod-
ucts" to live, especially ifmostof the
animals eaten have to be raised in
hon-id factory-farm conditions, where
animals are often not thought of as
living creatures

Chickens are debeakod, for ex-
ample, and “often shackled,“ all for
economic reasons. Iowa is the “numa
ber one pig producing state in [the]
country,” and it takes four pounds of
grain to produce one pound of pig
flesh. There are “six billion animals
killed for food in this country every
year.” stated Pacelle.

Sport hunting is illegal but“appro-
priate" at certain times of the year,
and many hunted animals are hit and
left to die, There are two hundred
million animals killed every year in
the United States by sporthunters,
20,000 of which are black bears, the
slowest reproducers in America.

Animals don’t need to be killed to
control their numbers, contended
Pacelle, ”Trapping has nothing to do
with wildlife management," said
Pacelle. “We don’t live in a world of
ultimarefreechoice.“ Heargued that

humans have the power to help these
animals, but that prejudice against a

different species is like prejudice
against a different race or sex.

More consideration should beused
in relation to animals, They are a
feeling, living species who need tobe
more adequately protected.

Flax undertakes subject of justice

By Alison Wade

The conce t of justice, examined
from psycho ogreal, feminist, and

post-modemist perspectives, will be
discussed by Jane P. Flax on Mon
day, Febmary 24, in South Lounge at

Emotional exercise in
racism affects many

By Adrienne McAdory

Last Wednesday, students of color
on campus were given a rare opportu7
nity to explore the tensions among
ourselves that serve to divide us along
racial lines. Dr. Kesho Scott pre-
sented a workshop in Main Lounge
that was geared specifically to ex-
plore difficulties students of color
have relating to each other.

A group of about 90 students of
color and a few white students gath-
ered and went through a very stress-
fulseries of personal revelationsThe
workshop dealt with the internalized
oppression students felt when con-
fronted with stressful situations relate
ing to their cultures.

One of the most important things
heard at the workshop was, "Don’tbe
defensive, say itand mean it, like you
expect it and it’s predictable." Dr.
Scott said this when a student related
something they would never like to
hear from another person about their

race.

Many times students of color are
intimidatedbysirangelooksand com
ments when their cultural practices
are outside of the “norm“ or “stereo
typical." . These were issues addressed
in the workshop, along with issues of
isolation that one feels when they are
in any way different from the major
rty.
One portion of the workshop in
volvcd a small group of students of
one race standing while other stu-
dents shoutcd derogatory comments
they had heard or had said about that
student’s ethnic group, It was painful
to see that Students of color share not
only oppression by the dominant
group but iacistattitudes toward other
students of color.

Ultimately, this workshop left me
with feelings of emotional upheaval
akin to thatofa silent scream, but the
real value will be in using the work-
shop to better reach other students of
color.

philosophy: thus, she incorporates a
multidisciplinary perspective in her
ideas and works. t-ter talk, entitled
‘TheSubjectofiustice:TowardNonr
Raiionalistic Theories of Jusu‘ce,“ is
of significant interest to anyone inter-
ested in political science, psychol—
ogy, feminism, and philosophy. This
talk will draw from her book in
progress, The Subject offurtt‘ce.
“Since discussions about
justice...assumc and generate as-
sumptions aboutwho we are and why
wearelivingtogether,”Flax has writ-
ten, “discourse about justice cannot
do without concepts of
subjectivity. .It is botlt possible and
necessary to develop non-rationalist
concepts of the self andjustice. The

outlinesofsuchconceptionsareavail-
able in psychoanalytic
[approaches] . . .However, these ap»
proaches require tempering by
postmodernist skepticism...and a
feminist attention to gender."

Flax has contributed significantly
the understanding of psychology and
politics She is the author of numer-
ous articles addressing fem' ist
theory, post~modemism, and psychor
analysis within a socio—political cli»
