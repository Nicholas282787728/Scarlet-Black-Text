new postwould bo appointed by :ach incomingSGA ptcsi»
dent and vieeapresident and conﬁrmed by each outgoing
Joint Board.

SGA has reached no final decisions, however. “After
[this weekend's] trusteos' mooring, certainly before the up.
coming dectian cycle, we’ll have something," said Ford.

Borh parties, though, reported instant agreement on
qualities otan ideal representative. “They're going to need
to be familiar with the process," Ford said, “some kind of
omit knowledge of money and money matters. Someone
who will have to be trustworthy and representative in terms
otrheir ideas and in terms oFthsir perspective."

Osgood and Ford shared continuing concern over the
ﬂow ofinformation between the committee and student
body. Any nominee would be expected to discuss commit.
rce activities with both SGA and the student body at large,
said Ford; Osgood said that the committee would cont
tiilue to meet directly wid1 both SGA and studentsdtriztget

Among Grinnell's ton poor institutions, the only colt
legs with a comparable system of student inﬂuence is
Carleton. lo systcm mils for a minimum oFiwo students
on its budget committee, one nominated by the student
Senate and one dircedy elected by the student body.

“All oFthc other [peer] colleges are either totally secret
or mostly secret," said Osgood, “or there is no commit.
tee,"

Carlotori’s student representatives arosiibioot to the same
restrictions regarding speciﬁc ﬁgures as Grinnoll's will be,
he said, and similar restrictions apply to members such as

Faculty representative.

A goal accomplished

Whatever the reason. Ford has seen rho administration
Fulﬁll a mayor item of his dominant agenda as president,
which he now labels “shatetl governance. "

Last week's decision. he proposed, follows directly upon
the trustees decision late last spring to open trustee Com-
mittees to student representation and io open board meet-
ings to the SGA president. “The experience ofhaving Sill»
deno on committees has show that our students are at»
pablo, thoughtful, insightful and worth having as lucm»

other goals ofFord's. laid out in his midrorm report.
include the further expansion oFstitdent participation on
administrative committee, a new campus newsletter (soc

i), an amoral code otoonducr For the pturhase ofliswcat-

was articulated in a resolution passed by Monday's Joint
Board.

The resolution that Ford will present to trustees at this
weekend's meeting ealls For two dramatic shirts in college
ﬁnancial policy, One would guarantee that the tuition paid
by returning students w1ll not increase by more than l
psictnt beyond the annual inﬂation rate: the other, that
students ﬁnancial aid be increased each year in propoirioii
to any tuition increase.

“I don't think it's realistic that they will Implcmcnrcl-
thor part anytime soon," said Ford, though he endorsed
both wholeheartedly and described himself as “cautiously
optimistic," adding, “every proposal seems to create ant
other set ofdifﬁoultiis."

Onl'ne voting proposed for this election

Elections, cont. from p. 1

Senators will be trained in using Blackboard before the

rum South Lounge, whtch will provide wirelessmctwotk
laptops and Blackboard instmetions.

Like a pair otsuporvisors with a highlighter, a ditcc»
toty, and a ballot box, the software would prevent double-
voting by recording whether each student has voted, but
would automatically separate students names from their

Should the plans for ovotiiig go Forward, and voter
turnourwsre to decline, Zioha still hopes SGA will retain
the system. “I would hope no got at least two runs," he
said.

Election board members agreed that online voting was
still only a plan, but, especiallyattcr their meeting this week,
seemed to orpeet its execution. ‘
