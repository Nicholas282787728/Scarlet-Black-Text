One announcement in todays Scar-

hearts 0! several hundred Ginmell
men. That is the news that preliinu

for men, these to be constructed early

cr' and communication

next spring.

Tennis is a sport which nicrits far
more consideration than it has recent
ed in the past. Ereiy year a large
number of Freshmen “sign up” for
this sport and have some diliiculty
in finding a court available for their
matches. it is hoped that with four
new oncs, possibly or concrete or some
other hard surface, this demand will.

. be satisfactot y met.

There used to he a time in Grlnuell
college when men and women had in-
terests much more in common than
they now here. Those were the days
when the term, “Gi'illllell Family," or»
iginated.

Lately, with the rapid growth at the
insntution, there has come a change
in which the men and women have he—
come more alienated trom each cther.
The Quadrangle has to some extent
served to segregate the girls and it is
expected that the new men's dormitoi‘r
ics will tend to do likewise with the
men. Such a course otters both atl-
vantages and disadrnntrgcs,

In another column we are i iiiting a
communication on this subicct. Local
people time tor some reason hesitntcd
to give expresSlqn oi their iceiincs on

tremendous importance to the future

was the main theme of Rev. Cross'
talk at Vespers Sunday,

In connection with the story of Eli
job at Mt. Carmel, Rev. Cross talked
of ambition, triciidship,‘liate, and real~
ization. He asked the question, “What

about God? What ought a man to do? .

What dares a man to hope?"

The girls who have brothers in
school entertained thorn at dinner in
the Quadrangle dining room Sunday.

A club is bciug organized or girls in

"Only Child” organization is to be the

To the Editor; College his is es-
sentially si-titicizil. Problems arise
which are not met with in the home or
community, and must he handled in a
manner peculiar to the special candle
lions existing.

Such a problem has become acute in
Grinnell since the opening or the We-
ineii's Quadrangle. The situation Will
be even more complicated when the
proposed Quodrenglo tor men is come
ulcte. The natural social relations be-
tween nicn and women, always some
what warped in the college atmos
phere, have been almost completely
thwarted by the estahlishinent of arti—
' ial barriers.

In general the men and women of
Grinnell may now meet socially only
in a formal way. “Dates" are distinct-
ly formal, and the social functions pro-
vided by the various organizations are
even more so.

incoming students have almost no
opportunity to become acquainted with
those of the opposite sex. An intro-
duction may he obtained, it is true.
but pmple do not become friends, or
even acquaintances, by being intro-
dilced. A Freshman cannot help feels,
wit: that something abnormal existsj
here in the relations between men and
women. a leeling which ‘is not (lls~‘
polled by th [irsL visit to one of our
“Quaker meeting" class rooms.

Another change came when the old
mi cti clubs were given tip—the de-
cline in table manners and rctiiie—,
nicnts of conversation. At the men's
clubs efficiency in securing food is
now the chief object. We are told
that even among the women table
manners are not the best. A college
graduate is judged by externals, and
of these what is more noticeable than
his manners? No one or us wishes to
leave Grinnell lacking in trained man-
neis.

We are convinced that a solution or
this problem is to be round in a rc-
iurn to the mixed club, not in the old
way, but in the new dining halls, Let

and when the new Union is built let

inch and women share equally in both.
Wise supervision would be necessary,
of course. but the difficulties are
chieﬂy those of management.

This system would insure a wider
circle of both acquaintances and
friends. It would make both men and
women at home in each other's pres-
ence. It would improve the table man-
ners and general tone on both sides,
and would help immensely to make
Grmncll one big family.
