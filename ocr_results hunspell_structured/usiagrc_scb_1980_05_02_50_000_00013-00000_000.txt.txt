, The marvelous moped

what has less power than a
lawnmower, gets more miles per
gallon than some large pick-up trucks
gel per tanklul, and will pay [or itsell
in gas saving alone within twentyrlour
months?

The moped, or course, The ii-eshest
face on the transportation scene, the
moped has already been embraced by
t\venty~{ive million Western Euros
peans as the answer to their
astronomical gasoline prices,

And, by the end of the year, more
than one million mopeds will be
operating on American roads, a
Iwenty-Iold increase over five years.

The logic behind the moped's Suc-

ti the editor

cess is easily understood:

—50 percent oi all car trips are
made by one passenger.

—rour out of live car trips are less
than 10 miles,

iThe moped has an average ycarly
consumption rate at less than 33
gallons of regular gas if it averages 12
lniles per day. The same distance
traveled by a u.s. car required 274
gallons 0! unleaded Iuel. The annual
dillcrence these days comes to at least
$300 and is going up.

—The moped averages 135 miles to
the gallon and some are capable oi 175
miles per gallon.

—A middlepriced moped will pay

Keep the walls clean

To the editor:

In recent Weeks our administration
has had to implement a variety of
measures in order to preserve the
cleanliness of the bathroom walls in
Burling Library. The walls have been
scrubbednightly, and although recent-
ly they were greased to make the ink
come oii more easily, I pity those poor
workers who, heiore this, worked so
hard each night that they scrubbed the
paint oil, revealing the shining metal
beneath. What workers! This action
was necessary to forever rid our pic-
turesque and beautiful walls of the
hideous, iilthy, vulgar, demoralizing
graiiiti that so many students (if i can
venture to call them such), given an
excess of freedom, had begun to
scratch on the walls. Such decadent
Scribblings obviously signify
something terribly wrong with the
minds of the people involved. When
students begin to devote time to
writing things on subjects other than
classwork at a high quality institution
like this one, drastic action must be
taken, and thank God, the administra
tion has taken it.

Yet, I have noticed that even the
greasing ol’ the walls has not
discouraged the immature
“creativity" of the graffiti writers, It
is obvious, then, that the administra-
tion must use harsher measures to
combat this threat. To begin with,
they might paint the walls completely
black so that no graffiti would show. If
people continued to scratch the walls,
perhaps armed guards could be posir
tioned outside the bathrooms to search
students as they entered and con»
liscate all writing and cutting im~
plements. it necessary, pens and pen-
cils could be banned entirely from the
campus. If some writing still leaked
through, a guard could be placed in

May 2, wet)

each stall to monitor each student's
actions. B&G workers might ObJect to
being'forced to carry guns, but guards
could easily be brought irom the state
prison. It none oi these actions work,
the stalls could be removed complete-
ly, perhaps along with the outer walls
as well. The students obviously don't
know how to handle them anyway.
That would show the bloody bastards!
Whatever their course oi action, I
urge the administration to pursue this
matter, whatever the consequences,
until the students are silenced.

Use of the moped here in America

Currently. seven out of It) U.s. mopeds

Condemns
Skip Day conduct

To the editor: On Wednesday, April
23, “Skip Day" students placed string,
yarn, and paper all over the campus. I
am disappointed that students as in-
telligent and aware as those at Grin» '
nell waste the resources of this coun-'
try by strewing them about the college
campus for no good reason. They
harm the environment by wasting the
resources necessary to create these
products and by polluting the environ-
ment with the finished products. This
waste is contemptible. I wonder if
Grinnell students cannot express their
creative wit in an environmentally
harmless way.— Christiane Leitinger
