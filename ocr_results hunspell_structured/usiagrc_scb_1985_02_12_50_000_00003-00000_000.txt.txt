tirinnell College's lortunaie financial

position received national attention in.

Forbes magazine at 31 December 1934.
"Why does little Grinnell College have one
oi the hottest investment records or any
school in the Country?" asked Forbes.
Reporter Barry Stavro credited the cats
lege's amazing success to its willingness to
take risks For example:

Trustee Joseph Rnsenlield recalls a time
when the college owned only 3100.000 worth
01 marketable securities He recommend-
ed in 1567 that the school buy threeghunr
dred shares oi a company called Berkshire

The trustees are considering partial
divestment lroin South Airica to protest
their present raeial policies. A
preliminary proposal will be made to the
trustees by the students to End Apartheid
at the and ot Spring break.

Golden said that a committee to consider
establishing a scholarship tor a Native
American is meeting. He said an endow-
ment had been created in the past and has
been inactive until this time. The Commit
tee will work on activating this endow-
ment and discuss ways of recruiting
Native Americans to Grinnell.

average annual return at 19 3 percent

Nonetheless. there is no apparent
change in the Trustees' policy- towartl
South African divestment The reasons for
their stance. Drake said, have nothing in
do with any potential loss oi income

The Trustees wish to keep stock ill Lolll~
panies that do business in South Africa
because they feel that their iniluence can
be best exerted by maintaining a continu-
ing inﬂuence rather than by withdrawing
altogether; "You’re iar more persuasive it
you keep the stake than it you give it up."
said Drake.

Another reason Drake gave was that.
while recognizing the evils oi apartheid.
the Trustees hesitate to set a precedent for
making investments based on moral
judgments; Drake suggested that the
Board would otherwise feel obligated to
withdraw any holdings in defenserrelated
industries or even in companies that deal
in alcohol

“There are plenty at good investments
It's not because at the [ear of lost income."
the president insisted.
