CRAFTING QQQQQ
Whether honing time-honored skills such as nee-
dlepoint or developing a personal specialty such
as mermaiding—glrring t’ake mils onto photos of
celebrities so they look like ﬁsh—or pouring glit-
ter onto things that had no business sparkling in
the ﬁtst place, I ﬁnd crarting to be rhc mode of
procrastination least likely to inspire selﬁloarhing,
Plusgivinga crafted object to a loved one is a great
way to cam cheap brownie points Abe sure not to
forget Mother's Day this Sunday It also provides
hin group activity at all levels of sobriety. Crate
ing earns points for maintaining creative capacities
and basic motor skills that rend to atrophy with
strenuous academic labor. Minus one point for
making my room a perpetually glittery shitliole.

moment my organiatn'onal abilities fell into oblivr

doesn’t even sell anymore. Though it earns points
for not being homework eleaning is ultimately
just a different form of labor and too exhausting
to be an ideally rewarding term of procrastina—
non. Earns points for improving my living space
and for simplifying die studying process, but loses
one for not being ﬁm. Also loses a point for never-
being ﬁnished—now I'm just pulling mildew-

The usual Facebook, Grinnell Plans and obsessive
eel-nail checking aside, the Internet does wonders
for the amount of prucmstinarion possible. Ever
heard of wwwspotclc.com? This random quiz
site may not help you research for your paper, but
at least you‘ll be able to name every single Keanu
Reeves Movie. Anodrer ncw Grinnellian favorite,
omcgle.com, connects you to a completely ran-
dom person—look around atJolnt Board and half
your senators are hard at work—on messing wirh
some random person's mindiin a chat screen.
There, you can gripe about all the work you have
to do, as your real-life friends are bored of hearing

about it.

students that claim they can do work here are
kidding themselves. The Grill is a black hole of
productivity. You've been squineled away in the
lrbtary and think hey, there’s alunys people in the
Grill, I’ll take a break and go there. You go for a
cup otcotiree and a big cookie and them BAM its
three hours later and you haven't removed yourself
from the fnux-modepleatliet seats for so long that
you're unsure iryout legs still work These damn,
dirty Grill-rats have sucked you into their nest of
