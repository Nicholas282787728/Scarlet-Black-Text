SPEAKER SAYS GERMANY
HAS LUST HER SDUL

"Thru irer' ambition to doininatc thc
world, Germany lost her soul," said
ncv. Sbcldon, ot Perry, in a talk on
nTiuc Americanism" in chapcl ycstcr-
day morning. “The real American
cannot live under the sonic hag as my
justice.” »

Itcv. Sheldon compared America
with a inciting pot in which every na»
[loll and race me leprcsehted.

“Alnel‘lcfullsm is the soril or Ameri-
ca," continncd Rev, Sheldon. "Thg
three essentials or true hmcricanism
are rcligion, education and democracy.
it a mall lacks any one ot those he is
not a tiueAiuci-ican. Demo cy docs
not, as some pcople conceivc it, give a
man the right to do wlialcvcr he
pleases; it gives every man the libel'ly
to do right."

Rcv, Sheldon ex lamed two types or
patriotism The ﬁrst, the man who
troths at the mouth ovcr national ai-
ia s, and thc iii-an who is rcady to
makc any sacii cc for his country and
its ideals
