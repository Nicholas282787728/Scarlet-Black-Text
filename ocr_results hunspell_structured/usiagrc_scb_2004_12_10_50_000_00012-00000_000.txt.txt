Last word from the
last frontier

“I 111': [I view [ml I/i/tu [0 ii/ will) my [wk tumor] m 1). "
—Gertrudc Stcin

After introducing myself to many people across the state
ofMontnna, l lcnrncrl to keep my nltcrscgo profession under
ground; Montnnnns are overprotcctlve about new pcoplc mow
ing to their state as it is, and introducing myself as o wlitet was
met with much :mllpflzlicrlc cyc roiling somc Monmmns sup-
port rlll insular philosophy, is thcy sccm ro want ro closc rhc
doors to the castle liftci they vc ‘v.ed I was often risked ifI
likcd IVlontiiml, and upon inswcring yes, my new thuinnmncc
would answer “Good, Don't move hcle.”

Mon mm, by now, lms crcnrcd n name tor itsclfos n mccm for
writcrs, 2| sccond Iowa, i busrion oilitcmry activity. so why rhc
nnimosity from the locals? To them i was just another writcr
moving to IVlontilnn who would on its dirty laundry thcn tics
ilclywigglc out of the web, escaping unscathed
from the process.

Unlike the tourist industry of Montana 7
which rostsrs n symbiotic rcaltlonship bctwccn

vcrsions ofMontann — what goes on with tour
ism and writing here is much more sinister.

Wrircrs have, in the past, consumcd Mon-
tnm’s product is another typc oftourist: Montana is somcthing
sold to writers, rcpnckngcd, and sold again to Eastern tourists of
n diftcrcnt sort. And this process bcgins to look very much like
the deﬁnition otcxploitition.

Montana, by now, has

animosity from locals?

the expatriate EX’

pcriencc is now — depending on your viewpoint or interest in
things vogue — Monmmns understand how some writers use it
in thcir approach to Monmns,

As Lcslic Fielder said, Montana is the lair‘ Franlilr, rlicrc
rs no more ultimate West, Somc wrirtrs, Hemingway among
them, have used the West as a dc fncto expatriate experience 7 as
a way to removc themselves enough from the United States to
writc about it. Montana has served and does
scrvc Tls a similar cxparriatc nichc to Paris in
the 1920s, Prague in the 80s to mid 905, and,
oflnte, Budapest. Iscnse in Montanons truss
tmtion at the temporary role writers give the
state and nnvicty nbour its insularity being :X-
ported. I think the ambivalence stems from
the fact that Montanans at onceembrace their
explicit differences from the rest of the States,
yct resent the role of i’oriegncr the writer-
tourisrs assign them.

And so, i tdmit n certain tendency toward exploitation in my
writing about Montana, but in my own defense, I don't think I
cvcr aired dirty lrundry. 1 never cxpcctcd pure objectivity from
myself, but rhc more isolatcd and bizarre my circumsrmnccs got,
the more and more I smiled the urban girl voice.
