it should be recognized that

went off with comparatively

wide range of interests that
college students have, extra
durricular activities must take
in a wide scope. At the same:
time, in a college of Grinnell's‘
size. this means that some will
attract only a few members.
Therefore. many small organi-
zations are engaged in a con—
linilal struggle for survival, and
due to their small size, nave
difficulty in putting on pro

worthwhile.

However, if various organi.

To the editor:

Over ohe summer, a drastic
change occurred in Grinnell‘
College policy which directly at-
fectcd -us as students, We are
rererring to the change in the
grading system. Each of us has
given this matter serious thought,
and we would like to present
our teelings on the subject,

Most or us have chosen Grin-
nell because it is a small college
known lor its attention to and
emphasis on the individual. We
have been told by advocates of
the new system that the over-all
school average will remain un-
changed, and we consider this the
more serious aspect of the sit-
uatton, l

ulation to higher attainment. On
the strength or parent and
student opinion, certain othcr
changes have been made by the,
administration at Grinnell Col-
lege in the past year. This change
in the grading system was made
without any anempt to secure
student or parent reaction; more»
over, this change directly at-
lects every student 'of the colsl
legc, not merely a minority‘
group. Ought not a college,
which advertises its emphasis on
the individual student, grant:
these individuals the right to
participate in _the formation of‘i
'policies aiiecting the primary
purpose of college, getting an
education?

For the above reasons. we 1'
commend that the gradi g sy-
stem be immediately cl ifled to
parents and students In iAl'le
meantime, some of us strongly
favor: continuing mid-semester
grades and allowing upper-‘
classmen to giaduate under the
grading system with which they
began college'and which in-
fluenced their original chaice of
Grinnell.

these was established by th
comparatively few cases of’flu
