never officially approved the ac—

deciding not to report grades

Student Council Prolesls Semester

Suspensions; Urges

The Student Council last
night officially protested the
penalties imposed by the ad~
ministration with regard to the
drinking and car rules.

The recommendation of the
Council included a new sched-
ule of penalties. They suggest-
ed a two week, rather than
semester, suspension for first,
offenses semester suspension for
second offense and expulsion on
the mird offense.

It was also suggested that
each individual Case be review-
ed by the Personnel board. At
the present time, blanket auth-
ority is given to certain admin-
istrative officials for removal
of students.

A third notation on the rec-
ommendation provided that the

Tom Rodhouse, north Youn—
kel' freshman, reported that
Norman Marble has promised
action on shades for the Union
TV room.

Student Council representa-
tives will consult their respec-
tive halls regarding student
opinion on reinstating the use]
of midsemester grades. Kenyon
Knopf, faculty advisor, in re-
viewing faculty decisions, stated
that there will be some type of
ﬂexible system in regard to
honors projects, Dean’s lists
and scholarship grade require—
ments which will informally
reduce difficulties in setting a

of the offense, rather than al

quirements under the new
grade system.

 

Administration Tells Position
Allirming Rule Enlorcement

In interviews with a Scarlet and Black reporter this week,
president Samuel N. Stevens, Dean of the College Max B. Fuller,
Dean of Women Evelyn Gardner and Dean of Men Henry A.
Brown reaffirmed the administration position on the enforcement
of the automobile and drinking rule.

The following points stand out prominently:

the administra-

tion feels that the rule should have been well understood, since
letters and the pledge cards were sent to parents and students this

Four Earl-ed T
To Phi Bel'e
Wednesday

Elizabeth Barnard, Robert
Bonner, Marilyn Harrington, and
Portia McNaliy were\received
into Phi Beta Kappa at the
semi- annual Phi Beta Kappa
chapel Wednesday morning. The
four seniors were elected to the
oldest and best known honorary

fraternity on» the basis of scho-
lastic standing.

Sophomores George Drake,
Charles Hastings, Patricia
Schroeder, and Claudette Scy-
mour were presented book
awards for having obtained the
highest grade average during
their freshman year.

Grace Hunter (English) con-
ducted the service and intro—
duced Neal Klausner (philoso-
phy and religion) who spoke on
"Philosophia Biou Kubernetes"
-—“Philosophy,nthe Guide of
Life."

Klausner discussed the mean-
ing and use of philosophy and
the attempt of man to gain
perspective to serve as a guide
in the complex world today.

He stated, “No one philosophy
is the sole possesor of the en-
tire truth. The danger today is
not from too many perspectives,
out rather from those who
think their perspective alone is
right.”

In a statement tc-the Scarlet
and Black he said “The faculty
reviewed the change in the
grading system which was made
last June, especially the impli-
cations in regard to the grades
the individual faculty member
uses in grading the tests in his
course.

“The faculty understands the
grading system to be those
grades which are handed in to
the Registrar at the middle and
end of the semater.

"It was agreed that each fac-
ulty member undertake to clar»
ify to the students in his
courses the manner in which his
grades on written
work will be correlated with
the grading System of the Col-
lege."

Dean of the College Max )3].
Fullcr said yesterday that ‘It
was not an official motion which
was made and seconded. Miss
Gardner, who is chairman of
the Personnel board, made a re-
port to the faculty in which the
action was announced, and a
faculty member rose to express
his approval of the action. An
unofficial straw vote then in-
dicated that the majority of the
faculty approved the action.”

sunllner; the singing of the
pledge card before registering
this fall made the regulation
and the consequences of its
violation even more dramatic;
and that this is a way in which
the student request to be treat.
ed as an adult can be met.

Dean Fuller noted that "The
trustees have reaffirmed again
and again their desire for
continued enforcement of the
rules." Fuller said that a five
douar fine and a one week
suspension just does not on-
force it.

President Stevens further ad-
ded that students had bragged
to him that there were as many
as sixty student cars in the
city limits of Grinnell last
Spring.

Pertaining to south campus,

Dean Gardner said “The Lea-

gue Board is still wining to

take an active interest in

these rules. it has no power

in determining the punish

ment but intends to consider

lids year an experiment and

..pccsibly come up with a re-..
commendation on behalf of the

girls next year.” She admitted

that the rule was a harsh one.

but said she hoped it would,
end "the trouble."

Dean Brown stated that
especially in the case of the
drinking rule, he can’t know the
guilt of the student involved in
such a situation, but he added
,he hoped to be as impartial
as possible and cooperate with
full enforcement of the rules.

President Stevens commented
on the summer meeting of the
C of HP, saying that the group
wanted no part in enforcing the
drinking rule this year.

He said the only Solution he
could see was in enforce a
penalty so great that a stu-
dent would hesitate before de-
ciding to break these two
rules; and that then he would
have to take the calculated
risk involved.

Although several parents of
suspended students have at-1
tempted to use influence, Presi-
dent Stevens said, there would
not be any special cases. it is
as strict and simple as that, he
concluded.

Men Reques’red To
Regisler Firearms

Wi+h Dean of Men

Dean Henry A. Brown this
week made announcements oon‘
coming the possession of fire‘
aims in any campus rooms. He
strongly urged that all men with
rifles for hunting purposm re—
gister them in his ofﬁce immed-
lately.

Brown also advised that ar-
rangements should be made by
the student as to where he can
clean his game. ”Too many stu-
dents were carelﬁs about this
last year and did their cleaning
in the halls without any care as
to their other hall members," he
said‘.
