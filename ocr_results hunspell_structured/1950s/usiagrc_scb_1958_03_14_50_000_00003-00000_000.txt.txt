the mixture of logic and intui-

Last Friday, Saturday and
Sunday three delegates from
the Grinnell Studcnt Council
attended the Midwest Confer

ciation spring conference at
Lawrence college in Appleton,
Wis. in conjunction with this
was a college editors’ conier.

Present at the conicrcnce
were Sue Berna, SC pub-

licity chairman, Gerry Thornpr

Rawson representative, Anita
Parkhurst, feature editor, rep
resented the 5&3.
so Discussions

Saturday the SC dclgatcs took
part in various discussions con.
cerning the problems of student
government. An attempt was
made to keep the discussions
general at ﬁrst so that the var-
ious delegations could ﬁnd com-
mon ground. '

Some M the areas consider-
ed were promotion of partici—
pation in extra-curricular ac-
tivities, communications lie-
tween Student Council and the
student liody, student unions,
methods or stimulating intel-
icctual curiosity, ctr-campus
activities, problems of wom-
cn‘s government and coordi-
nation between organizations.
The system of class ornccrs
was considered as several of the
schools have been thinking or
abolishing the offices which
have little function. Also dis-‘
cussed was a proposal by Man-
mouth for, a conference sports,

manship trophy to be awardcdl

Last on the schedule was a

to admit Bcloit to the MCSGA
was brought up but tabled as
the necessary consent of all

not yet been received.

to improve the quality oi eon—

ing several speakers through
out the year to tour conier-

by Grinnell as the delegation
felt that the quality of crin-

The Monmouth proposal for
a sportsmanship trophy was ap—
proved by Grinneli. Bcrorc ad—
