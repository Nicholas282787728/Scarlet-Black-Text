New Hazing Plan For Women
Ends Wl‘l'll HalloweenHell Day

By Sue

O’Brien

Until Monday night‘s houusemeetings, the Quadrangle
was kept in suspehse as to the nature of the prepping pro-
gram for the women of the class of ‘61. Rumors began to
elrclllate during the‘ latter part of the summer and reach—
ed their height last week. Individuals wondered whether
prepping would be abolished, radically revised or continued

in the same familiar vein. Mon-
day, it was found that prepping
would certainly continue, with
some new variations on the
themes of years past.

Hzllowe’en “Hell Dayj’

Basically, the emphasis oi the
program was changed. Seeking
to inspire hall unity and spirit,
the League Board has instituted
a policy of prepping not the
individual but the hall. Preps
are-to ”pool" their blackmarks
in a hall blacklist. Marks can~
not be worked off by the in-
dividual girl to whom they
were given but have to be
erased by points accumulated
by the hall acting as a unit.

Whitemarks arc to bc corned
by the quality of inter—hall raid
ing parties and oi the enter-
tainment at these events, The
allocation of whitemarks will be
left to the prepping chairmen.
At the end of the season, the
hall with the leastpercentoge

 

 

of remaining biackmarks will be
awarded a trophy at a prep “pa-
jamzl party” on Halloween.

The party is to climax a
“Hell Day" of no talking or
dating. This day will be the
only “dress-up day" in the
program. The theme of the
prep's costumes has not ‘yet
been announced, but don’t be
surprised if the campus is in.
vaded by a mob of witches.
Other added attractions in-
clude a requirement that the
freshmen be “intimately ac.
quainted" with the AWS Rule
Book. Ignorance of a rule can
incur a blackmark. This, inci-
dentally. requires that the_prep-
pers as well as the prepped
know the rules.
