Coach Irv Simone is not as

iiast yclu'si “This mect will
be the hardest nnc l'or us to
wirni There are at last mine or
two good swimmers, possible
that place swimmers, in all

ing this into consideration 1
can easily see how orinnell

oi the first place spot. 1 am
just hoping that the team real»

lower than iiith"

Simone does feel that his
team, with its depth, is the
strongest that will hit the water
this weekend. Yet the other
teams \\ill be in a very good
position to cut the Pioneers in
several (l[ the events,

Carls. Cornell Are Favoriies

This weekend the Glillliell
i\lcst1ing‘ team finishes the
season at Carleton in the
17th annual Midwest ‘con—

5‘ fel'cllce wrestling meet.

Jerry Coolie (above) and Bruce
Wilkerson (leitl, curcnptains oi"
the Grinuell wrestling squad,
will be two or the outstanding
Pioneers in the conierenee meet
at Carleton this weelrend Cooker
wrestling at 123 lbs., and WiH
lrerson, heavyweight, were an.
deieated in conierenee dual-
meet competition. _ . t

Deteiiding champion Carleton,
who detratcd Cornell last year
alter Cornell had won the cons
icrenre meet for 15 straight
years. will be out to preserve
last years pertormance Al-
though Cornell has been plage
vcd with iiiinries. its team is
undatcated .in conference (:0an
petition, Four men will return
this year who placed in last
year's meet.

Carleton has lost only one
meet this season, that being a
20.15 dcieat at the hands oi
Cornell. The oarls will have

at their disposal iive returning
.plncel‘s in last year’s meet, in.
cluding one who took first
place and three who were
rllnllerssup.

Crimiell will enter the con»
fcl'ence meet with one win,
eight deteats and a draw in
ov all competition. On the
ba. s pt this pertarniance it
would seem that the Pioneers
had little rhanee. On the con-
trary, howeve- since the meet
is a double elimination contest,
Grinncll has a very good chance
to iinisli near the top. Pioneer
hopes will he carried primarily
by ro—raptain Bruce Wilkerson,
second in last year’s meet in the
heavyweight division, Dave Van
Anl'ooy at 177,,and the other

coecabtain Jerry Cooke at 123.
