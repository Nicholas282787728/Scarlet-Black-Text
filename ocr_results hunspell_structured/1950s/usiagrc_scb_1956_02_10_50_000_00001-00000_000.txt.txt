'Gii'ls Oppose
Nigh’r Checks

By Mary Mills

Grinnell girls voted against
the new night monitor system in
an informal poll of women con-

‘ducted by the 5ch Wednesday.
130 voted no and 38 yes in an-
swer to the question ”Are you in
favor of the new night monitor
system initiated on south cam-
pus Monday night, February 6?"
165 did not answer. A response
of 50% is considered good for a
poll.

The system, which provides
for a monitor in each of the
women‘s balls to check in
each student at 10:30 1a m
was revived by the League
Boardlastlvronday night after
an absence of two and one
half yen".

In stating the League Board’s
position President Pat Larralbee
said that the group felt there
“iwﬁ a definite need for a sy-
stem of lcheckirg.” “‘A lack of
trust is not the reason, but
rather this system will serve as

a protection for the girls who
are innocently forced to shay
_ cut, as a protection for the
House Presidents who are re-

sponsible in case a student is
not in.” ‘

”We just cannot run the
risk of having something such
as injury {one a girl to: stay
out all night 1 ice] that the
girls are opposed to this sy-
steni because they do not
Iindchtnnd our reasons for
initiating it”

Typical of the comments by
girls on the 5&3 questionaire
slips was this:

"The system is unnecessary
and ineffective and regressive.
I don’t believe it‘will save
worry on the part of the House

President, House Moﬂlers and
Administration, but because of
the antagonism present, it will
only cause a lot of trouble and
resentment." ,

Others, however, felt diﬁfer-l.
...enlly:

”The administration is re:
spona'hle [or our actions and
have been given this respon-
sibility by our parents 1 am
not in any way inconvelicnc—
ed by the system and have no
intention of inconveniencing
myself by hiding in clothes
closets. Such immaturity can
only emphasize the need for
restriction.”

The system undoubtedly will
he one o: the main subjects of
discussion at the open League
Board meeting to be held Mon-
day in Main lounge.

Bowen Announces

ROTC To Resume

On Eleclive Basis

President Howard R.

Bowen, in his summary of
the recent trustees’ meeting
presented to the student
body Wednesday in ARH
auditorium, announced that
the disestablishment of the Grin»
nell AFROTC unit will be
canceled, and the operation or
the unit will be resumed lme
mediately on a voluntary basis.

The current “phasing out"
process of the ROTC unit was
halted by a decision of the
Secretary of the Air Force .to
retain the ROTC units in
schools where they had been
recently d'sestablished. The
Air Force approved the trus-
tees' request to retain the
Grinnell unit, and also gave
[remission to have the unit
continue activity on a, volun~
tnry basis, as requested by
President Bowen.

As the new situation stands,
all freshmen and sophomores
may re-register on a volunatry
basis. Bowen made it clear that
if students drop a semester of
ROTC they are automatically
denied any chance of continuing
later. Voluntary initial enroll-
ment of freshmen and new stu-
dents will take place next year.
Those sophomores who did not
take either the stanine tests or
physical examinations are per-
mitted to take them now it they
Wish.

Board Matches
Grant By Ford

The trustees Monday an—
nounced plans to double the
recent Ford foundation grant
and to more than double the
amount of faculty salary in-
creases made possible by
grant income.

Grinnell’s share of the Ford
grant is approximately $474,000.
The grant provides that approxi-
mately two-thirds of the total
amount be held as an endow-
ment, income from- which would
go toward increasing faculty
salaries. The other one»third, a
smut-lied ”accomplishment
grant", may be used for any
purpose. The accomplishment
grant was a bonus in recogni-
tion of college efforts in re
cent years ,to raise faculty
salary levels.

The “double-Ford" plan was
adopted by the trustees at
last weekend‘s meeting. They
decided to earmark the entire
Ford grant, including the ac-
complishment grant, as endow-
ment for faculty salaries, In
addition, they set an objective
to secure an equal tun-amt all
capital to match the Ford
grant, and to designate its in-
come as well for faculty
salaries.

The total Ford grant amounts
to almost one and one-half

times the money spent for faculv
ty salaries in 1954-55. Income
from the grant and its match-
ing sum is expected to be at the
rate of 4 per cent per year.
When the double Ford plan is
fully effected over the next two
years, faculty salary increases
will be up an over-all average
of ll per cent.
