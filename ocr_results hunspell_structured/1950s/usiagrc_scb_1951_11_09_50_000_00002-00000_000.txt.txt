Sincerely,

To avoid such difficulty in future years, the commit» Sagittarius H

tee and the 3&8 recommend the formation of a homecom-
ing committee in the spring to make plans for the following
year. With definite chairmen to head each committee, and
with adequate time to formulate ideas and arrangements,
Grinnell college should be able to have a successful home-
coming. Another troubler in this year’s planning was the
lack of funds. Along with the homecoming commitee, we
suggest a definite \sum of money to be allotted for use in
homecoming festivities.

Leaders are men who aren’t
like other people. They can go
ahead and do things that no one
else is doing or has ever done
end pretty soon the whole world
is following suit, or, at least, ap-
proving. Sometimes leaders get
to be presidents of things, and
sometimes they go to jail or to
insane asylums. Leaders aren't
worth worrying about.

For turning in the best ques-
tion, Hurtgen will receive one
free Carton of Chesterfield cig—
arettes. Entries for next Week
must be turned in to the S&B
office not later than 5 p.m.
Tuesday. Decision of the judges
is final.

These people need adequate
guidance. They ere ruled by pas—
sion and passion is a powerful
thing. Sometimes one man can
carry the load and do all the
guiding but he has to be bigger
and better than anyone and
everyone. Sometimes, when there
is no one personality available, a
group of lesser leaders takes
over and they pool their abili—
