Propose Magazine
As Literary Outlet

A new monthly magazine pub—
lication, “Maverick", was sub»
mitted for consideration at the
English department meeting
Monday by Bob Dickinson, Gatcs‘
junior, and Charley Hastings,
Clark Junior,

Dickinson and Hastings said,
"The magazine would be printed
by ordinary office duplicating
processes. By abolishing com-
mercial priniting costs, the print
ing cost of the magazine would
be reduced by some 05% from,
last year's Arena expenses. Wei
hope to be able to pay staff and!
contributors of “Maverick," ‘

Plans Very Tentative ,

Hastings stated that the pro-l

posed publication would prob-t
ably contain 60% student mater."
ial including essays, fiction. poem
try and letters to the editor.
Twentyrfive per cent of the mag
gazing would contain columnsi
and features, campus and world‘
politics, science, music, sports on

reviews, and college activitiesl
The icmaining 15% would prob»
ably be devoted to humor.
, Grace Hunter (English) stated‘
that the English department has
taken no action, but that “Wet

Herbert Prescott (English,

Board of Publications, stated “1

I The fact that the nationally
‘televised hearings in Washington,
‘D.C, last June prevented Welch
Lfrom returning to Grinnell for
this 40th reunion was a matter
of statecwide interest.

The Des Maines Tribune
hnnunented editorially that
while sorry Welch couldn‘t
take time out for the trip
“we’ll wager that. his fellow
alumni have seen more of him
in the last two months . .
than in the last 44 years.”

As special Army counsel,
Welch enioyed a sudden rise to
fame. His face and speech be.
came familiar to millions of tel-
evision viewers, and his life
story was repeated in newspa»
pers and magazines in every part
of the country.

Time magazine characterized
him as “easily the smoothest
performer, and perhaps the
abicst lawyer in the McCarthy
hearings" and “though . . . a
superb actor . no light-
weight; he has a foxy, season»
