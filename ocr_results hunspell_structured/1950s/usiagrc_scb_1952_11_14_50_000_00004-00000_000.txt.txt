E3 of HP Deba’res
Penal‘ly For Thef+

Paddles worth $200 were
stolen last Monday from the
C of HP room in Gates base-
ment.

in a meeting this week, the

council was undecided as to
the exact punishment for the
theft. But, they said. it will
largely depend on whether or
not those responsible return
the paddles voluntarily.

in any event, those respon-
sible are liable for prosecution
.under civil theft laws, as well
as for college action, the coun-
cil axerted.

if the theft was meant to de-
lay or end prepping, it was
unsuccessful, the council said.
Preps will be required to buy
paddles from the local lumber

companies at a higher COSL

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

The freshman football squad
under the guidance of Coach
EG Booth wound up their sea-
son last Wednesday afternoon in
an intrasquad game between
two teams containing a mixture
of freshman and varsity plays
ers.

The Red team captained by
senior end Rick Fledol‘owlcz
edged the Gray: led by sophov
more Dave Norris lies in a
dusty battle marked with numa
crous fumbles:

The Gray jumped to a 6-0
lead in the second quarter when
Bill Kelce, freshman guard, ins
tercepted a Ram pass and went
15 yards to score his team’s only
touchdown,

The Reds quickly retaliated
on the first play of the second
half with a brilliant 60 yard
sprint around left end by senior
Lin Stacey to knot the score.
The ball seesawed hack and
forth during the remainder of
an abbreviated second half un-
til the last play of the game.

With the ball on their own
35, the Reds. with Bob Norton
at quarterback. threw a long
pass which Charlie Dunham
gathered in and later-aled to
Fiedorowicz who plunged over
the goal for the game deciding
score.

Hcad football coach John
Pfitsch planned this contest in
order to watch the yearlings in
action as a preview to next sear
son‘s prospects. Pfitsch was par.
ticularly impressed by such
boys as Tim and Dick Walker,
Warren Sandler, Jim Junge,
Bob McKay, and Vic Ramplea
burg.

The intrasuuad game marked
the end of a season for the
frosh in which they dropped
two games, the first to Cor»
nell‘s yearlings on a fumble
deep in their own territory,

Pioneers fell to a visiting Coe
squad 20-6 after jumping to an
early lead on a pass. The Grill-
nell tally came on a pass from:
