uThere Was A Man In OurTown"

by Marty Kelly

“lt’s'going to be the most
lively and spontaneous show
since Sing Man Sing,” said
Al Harrison, author and di-

rector of this year’s student
musical, There was a Man
in our Town. A] continued,
“It’s on a smaller scale than pre-
vious shows but I hoped-t re-
vives interest in the student
musical, and i hope that it gets
bigger and better, as it should
in later yeals. Three years
ago up to a hundred people
worked on the Show. That’s the
way it should be.

The sixth annual student
musical will he given tomor-
row night at 8:00 in the high
school auditorium. Admission
is by activity ticket.

The student musical’seems to
have a record oi last minute
difﬁculties and this year is no
exception, Early this week, one
oi the leading characters, Jim
Olson went to the inflmal'y.
Jim=s part was taken over by

The set was finished Tuesday
but it couldn’t be moved to the
high school until Thursday be-
cause of the program Wednes~
day. As a result the cost has had
only two days to rehearse on the
set and people have been learn-
ing lines up until the last min-
ute. In spite of everything the

show is in good shape, and the
cast is highly enthusiastic.

The script’ior There Was a
Man in our Town is based on
a Roman comedy, The Crock
ol Gold by Plautus It is the
same script that Moliere's
L‘Avare was taken trom.

Harrison has set the show in
a small town coffee-shop with a
collection of “typical” small.
town types; thieves, knife-throw.
ers, gamblers, and women or
very dubious virtue. »

This year’s set, built and den
signed by Tal Bowling, is a
half-set, built on an angle. This
is the fourth year that Ta] has
built the set (almost singles

handed) and the second year he
has designed it

Six people collaborated to
write the music, Dan Toit,
Tuck Walrich, Marcia Madden,
Chuck Hastings, Barb Jenkins,
and Frank l-lcyes. Although
for the last two years music
has been written by one per-
son, the first three musicals
all' had tunes written by a
number of people. Al has wﬂt<
ten all the lyrics. the first time
the author of the script has
also written the lyrics, and

they range from “Kiddies
Stories" to “Goin’ ﬂame.”

The student musical is the
only allrstudent show on cam-
pus. lt is written, produced, and
directed by students. The man-
ey is allotted by the student
council (com the social fee.
There is no iaculty supervision.
The producer (Jerry Tomlinson)
is appointed by the student
council and he appoints the di-
rector, chooses the script, and
handles the finances. $400 is al-

lotted for the musical.
Ln nnly six years the student

musical has become a trail}
tiou at Griunell. The lirst mu.
sical, Up a Tree was sponsor-
ed by the Gadahouts and di»
rected by Jim Leawcnworul.
The script was written by a
committee of iive people and
the songs by seven people. It
had a cast oi 70 in contrast to

this year-s cost ol' 25. The set
for Up a Tree was built by
Dick (lemons and one oi the
dancing leads was Jane Slich-
ter (now Jane mirnach).

The ﬁrst three musicals were
all repented as commencement
shows. The first four musicals
were all directed by Jim Leav—
enworth and one of them (Sing
Man Sing) received the Stein-
ar award for the best play of
the yenr. Last year was the
first year the musical had not
been sponsored by the Gad~
abouts.
