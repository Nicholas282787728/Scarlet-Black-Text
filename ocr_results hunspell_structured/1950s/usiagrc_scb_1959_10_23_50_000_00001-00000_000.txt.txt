3 Student Council Allocales Funds,
- Discusses Coke Machine Change

Student Council voted last
Wednesday to distribute
$2,906 of its funds. lThlS
leaves approximately $2,109
in the council treasury this
semester, and $700 of this
remaining sum has been set
aside for the Thanksgiving
musical.

The largest sum of money
‘ went to the Scarlet and Black,

which received $1,768.09 for the

' first semester. This approximate

increase of $500 over last semes-

ter is due primarily to a $600
decrease in national advertising.

KGRW, which also had its ad-

vertising cut, got 3400 from the

council for this Semester.

Also approved were the Stu-
dent Auditor’s request for $239
and the 5,50 per student allot-
ment divided proportionately
between the AWS Board and
the C of HP.

' President Steve Faunce an-
nounced that the first concert
in the Community Concert
series will be Monday, Novoim
bar 2, Students may obtain
admision to all Grinnell con-
certs by showing their activ-
ity tickets, but those wishing
to attend the out-of-town cane
certs in the series must have
regular tickets.

Mike Chandler, Coke machine
attendant, presented information
regarding the cup Coke dispen—
sers now in use and the dam
' ages done to them. He also dis~

cussed the possibility of chang-

. ing back to bottle machines.

The council considered

t chieiiy whether apparent stu—

dent disappmval of the pres-

. ent machines and moderate

decrease in revenue from them

. justify an attempt to change
back to bottle machines, even
though the Coca Cola. company
and the administration are ap-
parently opposed to doing 59.
Chandler was asked to con-

tact the company and college

personnel involved and report
back to SC next Week.

by Charles G. Cleaver (English)

Last spring the faculty rec-
- ommended to the Board of

Trustees that Grinnell college

refuse funds for student loans

which the federal go rnment
. offers under the provi cos of
the National Defense Education

Act of 1958. The Trustees ac-

cepted our recommendation. Be-
, cause I helped initiate this ac
tion, the Sand]; has asked lne
to explain my position.

The quarrel, as everyone
l. knows, is about the two loy-

alty oaths which the law re-
quires of a. student applying
for one of these loans. He
must swear, ﬁrst, that he does
not “believe in, is not a mem»
her or, and does not support
any organization that, believes
in or teaches the overthrow
of the United States Govern-
ment by force or violence or
by any illegal or unconstitu»
tional methods”; and second,
that he will “hear true faith
and allegiance to the United

States of America, and will
support and delend the Gun-
stitution of the United States
against all its enemies, foreign
and domestic.”

Such legislation could be op-
posed on pragmatic grounds
alone. in the ﬁrst place, it al-
most certainly fails in its pur-
pose, which, presumably, is to
deny to Communists the beneﬁt

' Objections To Loyalty Oaths
Reviewed By Faculty Member

of government money. if n ful
blown, orthodox Communist
should happen to enroll in this
college‘which seems unlikely,
somehow—he would hold that
the ends of his party justiiy
any means of achieving them,

and would hardly be deterredl

from his purposes by a small
matter such as a loyalty oath.
We cannot believe that such
nets catch any Communists;
they might, however, catch a
person who is sensitive to his
rights and duties as a free
man, or a conscientious dissent-
er, or somebody who is unwill.
ing to sign away his right to
change his mind about politics.
Consider the plight of such
a person: if he signs the
oaths; he assents to the valid-
ity of the belief among the
legislators who were respon-
sible for the oaths that stu-
dents as a class are suspect,
and require special policing;
if he refuses to sign, he he-
comes himself suspect in the
eyes of the society which
elected those legislators.
