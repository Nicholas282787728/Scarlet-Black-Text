'Room for Rhyl'hm' Feal‘ures
Varielyl Fas’r-Moving Ac’rion

by Marcia Dnlisker

Variety is the keynote in this year's student musical, “Room
For Rhythm," to be presented Saturday night, May 16, at 3 pm. 111
the high school auditorium. There's variety in the songS, in the
script, in the characterizations, and in the dances.

The entire action of the musical takes place in n moderately
expensive hotel suite in New York City. it is the story, in words
and music, of. a week in the life of this room, and its different

occupants.

The very nature of the plot,
or rather—the lack of a plot
helps to set the fast movmgl
pace and the sense of contin-
ual action of the production. 1

Some of the adventures '
moving through this hotel
room from Monday to Satur-
day, include those of the tra- l
ditlonnl hotel occupants, the
“just married" couple, some
religious fanatics, a few prom- l
inent members of the annual
Bakers’ convention, and the
humorous characters of 3 Com-
munistic satire.

The songs of “Room for
Rhythm" are of any and all
types imaginable, from solo and
group ballads, to marcha, re-
ligious chants, and rumbas.
Music between the scenes, in-
cluding the blues theme song
of. the beiiboy, helps tie the
Scenes together for a continual
effect.

Even though the cast is a
large one, there are very few I
characters who play minor
roles. Most 01 the characters,
as varied as they may he,
have good strong parts to play.
Included in this cosmopolitan
couglolneration are a famous
author and his wife, Mr. and
Mrs. John Hemingbeok;

Grandma Trollop and some of
her professional friends, Rob-
ert Wholewheat, Johanna Pmnr
pernickle and Willie Penny
Tart; a few FBI men, American
Legionaira, and some com-
rades of the Communist party.
A fellow called Shakespeare,
who could be classified either

ages to get himself into all of
the acts.

The audience isn‘t going to
spend any time staring at
blank curtains waiting for
scene changes, because even
though the scene shiits from
the hotel lobby to the hotel
room and back again—it is a
continuing action. Probably
the only break in the show
