An Explanation 0f Policy

The letter printed on this page, we feel, necessitates a
reply. Mr. Peisner’s observations are certainly most Interest-
ing and, if entirely valid, most disturbing.

It would seem pertinent at this time to point out that
Mr. Stocking speaks for himself as he writes his column.
Except in the case of libel or “bad taste” he is uncensored
by the editor. On the other hand, in these two columns, or
in any columns where the editorial “we" is found, the words
are written on behalf of the publication by its editor or edl-
torial writer.

In looking for a point of application, we refer to our
recent treatment of the Student Council—CofHP discussion
involving the fireworks fine. These words are written in ex-
planation of these two columns but we are not so sure they
might not apply to Mr. Stocking’s effolts also.

We do not feel that we fostered “distrust, disrespect

To the Editor:

The lack of intellectual cur-
iosity on the Grinnell campus
has been noticed by a few stu-
dents, several faculty members
and none of the administration.

Informal intellectual get-
together: are never seen. This
atmosphere is created in the
min by the isolhtion of
north and south campuses,
the “isolationist policies”
maintained in the true Grin-
nell tradition by each hall,
the faculty and mostly, the
students.

The law of averages and the
sucker-born-everycminute the-
ory, allows the entrance of a
few students each year who,
much to their despair, make
known their thought-out views
on politics, arts and the state of
the world. As a result, they go
to South America, hitchhike to
Mexico, or flee to Europe for
their junior year.

It has been stated many
times, even at Grinncll, that
colleges have the responsibilh
ty of developing the latent
“liberal artist” in each student.
If Grinnell is to develop these
interests, there must be some
fermentation, s o m e students
who can put fire water in the
college bloodstream.

The largest part of the
problem is that we get so few
nudcms on start this fermen-
mtion, then, by the process of
isolation, starve them of the
necessary sugar to continue.
This starvation is helped by
the attitudes of our deans

 

against anyone who is not a
“go—go-go student."

To improve this pernicious
situation requires the direct
recruiting of students who will
prism out stereotyperwhite into
a healthy intellectual spectra.
To recognize the type of stu»
dent we need is difficult.

I might first suggest several
changes in the admission policies.
Fl t, eliminate hook llsis upon
w ch everybody lies (judging
from our present student body.)
Second. stop supporting the
archiac policy that the best
students love their mother and
father, are well-liked by every-
body, play football and possess
an IQ. ol over doo.

Disregard completely any
applicant who uses the words
cool, nest; wow, sharp, nrc
up and gung—ho. In pliicc or
book lists and autobiogra-
phies, I suggest five para-
graph essays on the appli-
cant's intellectual interests
and the major influences he
feels have lcd him to formu-
late his cxprcsscd philosophy.

This problem is a difficult
one, and I personally feel sorry
for those who ﬁrst hit the
beach. If, however, we fail to
begin a positive program of
improvement, we shall contin-
ue to lose our best and most
useful students, fail in our ob-
vious responsibility to develop
the student body and continue
year after year to read similar
letters to the editor.

To the Editor:

It is apparently hazardous for
‘an individual or a group to act
or express Views contrary to
those frequently voiced or sup-
ported in a given newspaper. It
is probably just as hazardous
to suggest that motives and
means employed by newspaper
writers may be open to ques—
tion. Nevertheless, at times this
needs to be done.

It is h well-known fact that
individuals and groups in a
position of authority are es-
pecially subject to criticism.
Occasionally their judgment
and decision result in unhap—
piness oi- dissatisfaction for
others. They do make errors
in judgment and decision»
making.

Under certain conditions such
errors need to be discussed. with
2i vleiv toward reducing them
and making the individual,
group or groups more eﬁective
in carrying out their responsi-
lbilities.

Criticism of this kind is es-
sential and or college newspa-
per can and should make a
real contribution in this way
to the student body and the
college. But such a contribu-
tion can he made, it seems to
me, without relying on ridi-
cIIle, sarcasm and other propa-
