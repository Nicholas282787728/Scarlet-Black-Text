Coach lrvin Simone says that
if anyone is interested in swim.
ming it will be worth while to
come and see McKensie swim.

Simones hopes fo1 the meet
rest on the Pioneer's strength inK
the longer distances, and the
annexation of seconds and thirds
in McKensie’s events. Most of
he tankers are in their first
year of collegiate swimming
and for some it is their first
year of competition.
