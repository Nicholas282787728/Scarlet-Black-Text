Stevenson silver holevinvthee
shoe replica. it sells for $1 of
which the Democratic Nation-

off. both parties can provide
you with Democratic or GOP

There was a time when we
thought that we were witness-
ing the greatest battle of all
time here in the present cam—
paign, but now we find that
the honors must once again go
to Cowles hall, which has con-
tributed to its own‘ partisan

SCARLET AND BLACK

Congratulations are in order
ior our cross-countrymen. Coach
Simone and company knocked
off Lawrence last weekend to
make it two in a row. Captain
Larry Schaleger finished sec—
and, lust inches behind Viking
Ted Sutherland. Both runners
were clocked in 16:19, a couple
seconds better than “Schal's”
best time of the ’55 season.

The boys have looked great,
are again recognized as def-
inite threats in conference
competition. Nice going Wei»
don, Bacchus, Elliot, Richter,
and Downs — and good luck
against Ripon tomorrow.

Speaking of Ripon. our grid-
ders will be on their way to
the Wisconsin school after din-
ner this evening. Peterson de»
cided to break up the 350 mile
trip by stopping in Dubuque
some time tonight _ a good
idea. It's a long ride. The game
will he played under the lights
tomorrow. Kickvoff time is 7:30.

Just finished talking with
student trainer Robert Mind-
gett. We're in good shape,
physically. Soph lineman Gary
Nolder has recovered from a
knee injury suffered early in
the game last week. Bauser-
man and Burke“ have been
held to limited work bum
since last Saturday but are
ready to go now.

Tomorrow’s game will he the
first are affair of the season.
Spirit is great. “They really
look like a team,” was “Pete's"
analysis While Watching them
practice last night after dinner.
Saw a lot oi holler and drive
out there. Let's win
one!!!

Got wind that our varsity
mermen are planning a trip
south this winter — to keel)
in shape for the conference
meet, scheduled fur Grinnell
in March. Fort Lauderdale
will be their destination where
they‘ll spend two Weeks in the
sunshine. Even heard that
Jack “Jasper" Shaffer is plan-
ning to join them. if he keeps
playing football like he has
we'll have to ask the college
to pay his way.

Another note on swimming.
The pool has been all fixed
up. Lines painted on the ceil-
ing will aid backstrokers in
their turns. For those of you
that haven’t been swimming yet

number,

Grinnell's twicesdefeated foot-
ball team meets giant—killer Ri-
pon Saturday on the Redmen’s
home gridiron. Ripon downed
defending conference champs,
Coe college, last week. The Rio
pon eleven were ahead 21-12

when the gun sounded ending
the game.

Coach Bob Peterson’s Pio-
neer Squad is two down in
the 10$ column after having
dropped their last game to
Lawrence In what was called
by some observers “the battle
at the cellar-dwellers.” The
fact that the Grinnelllans have
been unsuccesslul so Iar in
season play will make them a
grimly determined team that
cannot be lightly regarded by
the Redmen.

When the Ripon squad trotted
off the field last week at Cedar
Rapids they had not only cross-
ed the Kohawk‘s goal line for
the first time this season but
had held the opposing squad to

Harriers Face
Ripon's Squad
In Dual Meet

Grinnell’s undefeated cross
country contingent tours the 3-
miie Ripon course tomorrow aft-
ernoon in quest of victory num-
ber three.

Not only the Pioneers' vic-
tory last weekend over Law-
rence but also the excellent
times turned in by the regu-
lars gave rise to the hope that
the team may once again be
the team to heat in the only
ference meet. Coach irv Si—
mone’s up-and-coming squad
was generally rated behind
Monmouth and Carleton by
the dopesters, although de—
fending conference champs

Ripcn lost stalwart Sammy
Holmes via graduation and any
strength must come from the
ranks of last year’s freshmen.
However in cross—country much
more than track, the home team
has a considerable advantage,
especially if the course is very
difficult.

Grinnell will probably be at
somewhat less than full
strength for the meet. Sopho—
more Chuck Yodk, third in
last week’s run, has come
down with a severe cold and
will probably be left home.

A new addition to the varsity
squad is Fred Boughey who will
be making his first varsity ap—
pearance tomorrow.

The rest of the seven-man
team includes John Weldon,
Noel Bacchus, Bill Elliott, Rick
Richter, Bob Downs and cap-
tain Larry Schaleger.

this year, the deck and bottom
of the tank have been repaint-
ed, and a curtain has been put
up to keep the water off the
spectators on starts.

“matey—Pioneers face Redmen Ai Ripon;
Feai Observers Predict Grinnell Win

a surprising 12 offensive plays
in the entire second half.

Coach Peterson has been
juggling his line-up this past
week and it is possible that
there will be some new per-
sonnel with the Iirst 11 men
when they march into the
Redmen’s terrltnry. The un-
dermanned Ripon grid team
will undoubtedly be up for the
game after trounclng one and
might possibly be somewhat
overconfident when they meet

the twice-downed Grinnell
team.

As the underdog. Grinnellwill
go into tomorrow’s game with
nothing to lose and everything
to win. Serious observers still
contend that the Pioneers look
top-notch on paper, so with luck
and a few breaks the varsity
will bring home their first vic-
tory this weekend.

Nor-ill, Snii’fh Tied
As Loop Leaders:
South ls Second

llvl football became a little
less violent this week as the re-
spective offensive and defensive
games of the teams began to look
sharper. Complex and deceptive
plays often baffled both the of<
fense and defenders.

Defensive potency was ap-
parent ln the 0.0 tie between
Dibble and Langan last Mon--
day. Kenedy was a defensive
standout for Langan on pass
detense stopping two Dibble
drives with interceptions. Paul
Rockne handled the passing
chores for Langan and Denny
Watson for Dibble found able
receivers in Jim Fuller and
Gordie Young.

Cowles and Rawson also met
on Monday with Cowles coming
out on top 13-0. First bloodwas
drawn by Cowles on an end run
by Hurst. The first try for the
extra point was wide, but the
play was called back for off—
sides and Gabrielson made his
second try good. Gray, running
in the fourth quarter, brought
the total to thirteen.

Hurst put in an excellent de-
fensive performance, and the
offense revolved around the
equally impressive Gray. Covalt
showed well at end, and‘Cza-
manske and Horton made their
first appearances in the starting
line-up.

Rawsnn‘s passlng attack [ail-
cd sadly as they completed
only (our out of eighteen at-
tempts with five interceptions.
Krnnwall blocked Well at left
guard and Pete Dooley was
Rawson‘s most valuable per-
former, carrying a great deal
of the defensive load.

N. Younker Downs Gates

On Tuesday North Younker
made a display of its gridiron
power at the expense of Gates.
The Younker eight hit payrdirt
in all but the second quarter,
scoring once in the first and
fourth quarters and twice in
the third to end the scoring at
25.0.
