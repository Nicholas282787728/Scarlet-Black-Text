In reality. Marx‘s contributions
can be roughly divided into
two categories: the polemical,
or propaganda broadside, as
typificd by the “Manifesto", and
the analytical, as typified by
the bulk of the “Political Econ-
dmy" treatise and "Capital.” Al-
though one phase of Marx's
thought cannot be wholly at-
tenuated from the other, yet
each phasc is indcpcndently inr
poi-taut. ' .

The grcit majority oi us
would no doubt take issue

However, Dr. Moore makes
it clear that Marx’s espousal of
the lattcr concept does not
derive ii-om abstract reasoning‘
but from critical observations
of specific situations. That
peaceful transition, under core

is possible, is entirely compalie
