Lively discussion followed
the proposal of Bob Fayette at
Student Council meeting yester-
day that a United Nations flag
be put up somewhere on cam-1
pus. Attempts to put the flag in
the chapel had been thwarted
by Dr. Winston King (dean of
the chapel) and there is a
chance that opposition would
occur if it were placed in ARH.
The fact that Grinnell college
seldom has even an Amcrican
ﬂag up was noted. Fayette will
make a report at a later meet-
ing. ,
Lora Lee Pugh, treasurer of
the Student Council, reported
$149.47, in the treasury. The
council decided. to spend at
least $20 to send delegates to a
small colleges‘ conference in
Iowa City and to the Midwest
Conference Organization meet-

of these conferences will be held
