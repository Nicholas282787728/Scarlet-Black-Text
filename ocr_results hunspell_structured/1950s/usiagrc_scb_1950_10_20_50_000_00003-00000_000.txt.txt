Some Minds
Like Eeyors'
Sféi’es Wélls

“Minds are made, not born,"
Dr. Ronald v. Wells, minister or
the First Baptist Church at
Anies, told the chapel group yes-
tar-day.

Dr. Wells caused Lovie Sturte—
vant and Dick Ccrvene, who

were the worship leaders, some
panicky minutes, however. Be
cause of the detour between
Ames and Gl‘lnnell his arrival
was delayed and at ten o’clock
it was anybody’s guess who was
going to speak.

Two years ago Dr. Wells spoke
at Grinnell and he said that
when he saw everyone pouring
out from classes then he wonder—
ed how many would show up
at chapel. Yesterday he wondere
ed the same thing. He exclaim—
ed, “I’m not concerned about
your opinions of the church or
of your earlier teachings but
rather that each student at Grin—
nell asks himself, “What kind of
mind do I have?”

Dr. Wells mentioned that dit—
ferent personalities have diiicr-
ent types of minds. There is
he said, the “Mie Many Minds”.
This type of person is confused
and. always is inpresscd the most
by the person he talked with
last. He has an air about him
of sophisticationeialse sopliistie
cation—for ”singleness or the.
mind it the essence oi great live
ing”.

He went on to say that “Mr.
Partial Mlnd” is a prevalent
personality at Aines. Grinnell
is a liberal arts school
so people here are supposedly
well rounded. But it is otter.
true that people leave college
so.highly specialized that they

. know about only one tield and
not very much about that.

"MISS Closed Mlnd” is a tragic
figure, he said. She is militant
and always has that ”fixed look"
about her. Life has frightened
her and this is her only protect—
ion.

When Dr. Wells asked how
many have read ‘Winnie the Pooh’
almost everyone raised his hand.
Eeyor, The Melancholy Donkey.
is a good example ot an “up
and down mind," he said. “You
know people like that, who love
being down in the dumps be»
cause there is nothing else lelt.”

Minds are always being crea—
ted and developed, Dr. Wells
continued. Paul is one of the
greatest examples. Only by “habe
it oi the heart,” can we meet
the challenge oi the world. Only
those who care and DESIRE
singleness or mind can have in
them “the mind of Christ".

Next week Dr. Wells will
speak at Denison and then at
Kalamazoo college where our

 

former dean oi the chapel, John
Scott Ever-ton, is president.
