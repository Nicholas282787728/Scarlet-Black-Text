Booth Announces

Library Contest
For All Seniors

E. G. Boom, member of they
Awarck committee, has announc—
ed that any senior may enter
the Personal Library conmest byI
ﬁling with the College librarian
before Aipril 1 a list of [books ill
his or her individually owned
personal library.

Since 1939, Grinnell has
awarded an annual prize to
the senior who has collected.
the best library. The purpose
or this prize is to encourage
and give recognition to the
owning or good books.

The award is divided Ween
the owners of the two best Li-
raries. The first prize consists
of about $25 worth of books of
the winner’s own choosing. The
second prize is about $10 worth
of personally chosen books Spe-

.cial1 lb‘oo‘k plates go with all

The third plan proposes un-
limited cuts for all students at
Grinnell and no recording of
cuts by the deans. Faculty mem-
bers would be responsible for
keeping track of all cuts taken
in their classes if they wished
to consider them in grading. One
hour of credit would he deduct-
ed for absences before and after
vacations.

Under all three plans, as
under the present system, any
faculty member could restrict
cutting in his class, but he
would be responsible for let-
ting students know his policy
on the matter at the beginning
of the semester. .

After hearing the plans and
discussing their merits and
weaknesses, the council voted
two motions. One recommended
that the academic standing com-
mittee consider allowing one
cut during the semester for the
periods before and after vaca-
tions to help out students who
might accidentally sleep through
a class, and that it consider
keeping the college open for stu-
dents who can not leave the
campus immediately after vaca-
tion. The other motion register-
ed the council's approval of the
unlimited cuts for all students
plan over the other two.

approximately four times its

have asphalt tile. Men‘s and
women's washroom facilities
will be provided at the north

end of the building.
Bookstore storage
There is a possibility that the

' whole east room will be used

for bookstore storage. At the
south end of the east room there
will be a Counter and, when
book Sales are Scheduled, the
students will be able to get their
books directly Irom this stol‘eA
room by using the east from
en'trance.

Samuel Wassorn, manager of
the bookstore, hopes to have
some new lines of goods when
he has additional space. He also
felt that the store will do more
with trade books and better tier
tion and that the store could
afford to get more best sellers
as listed in Publisher's Weekly.

“we should have a more mods
ern type of merchandising."

The work now going on will

area painted by Commence—
