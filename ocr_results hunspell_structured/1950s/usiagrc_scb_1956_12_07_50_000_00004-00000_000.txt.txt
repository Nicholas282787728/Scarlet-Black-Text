Communication

The proposal of the Stu—
dent Council discussed in the
adjoining editorial, requires
further comment,

Communications between
the council, the League
Board, and the Council of
House Presidents are at pres-
ent a oneeway operation. The
presidents of the League
Board and tlle C of HP are
members of the Student
Council and its Central com-
mittee. They represent their
governing bodies at council
meetings, alld also represent
the council at their own Lea-
gue Board and C of HP meet-
ing-s. The C of HP has ten
tatively consented to bar-
lug a representative at all of
their meetings; the League
Board. after it separates the
entire issue from the S&B
will consider the suggestion.

The representative would
be a non-voting member, wllo
would report cases symptoe
matic of campus problems to
the Central committee. Lea-
gue Board says that ill its
Thursday meeti gs, they dis—
cuss personal problems which
would be too confidential to
allow an eighth person ill
their meetings.

We feel that an eighth
responsible person wollld
make no difference. Also, the
Central committee would not
be interested ill personalities
but problems which they rep.
resent. The Student Council's
representative would not
have to report names, only
cases.

We feel that if student
government is going to enter
a broader area of serving all
the students and their prob?
lems, there should be two—
way communication. We are
not questioning the ability
of the two presidents to act
as li 'son both wl ; we do
question the low position
to which the Strident Council
seems relegated. It can only
obtain official information
from the presidents of the
two governing bodi s, but
these two bodies obtain ol'l'i-
cial information from both
places.
