Varsity Wins;
Defeats Olaf

By Noel Bacchus

Scrappy but exclting basket-
ball with occasional glimpses of
fine play marked the second
Grinnell-St. Olaf game of the
Midwest conference, as the Pie-
neers downed the Oles 65-60
in a closely contested game.

To a team, weakened by
the 10$ of the Mchmsey twins
through sickness, and Tom
Doyle ‘through ineligibility,
Bud hoegge, sophomore from
Gridley, 111., became a tower
of strength, snatching rebound
after rebound from the Oles,
enabling sharp-shooting Dick
Crowl to hit 19 points and
Larry Koch 13.

St. olef's Conrad Freeman
spearheaded the Oles‘ offense
with five field goals and six
fljee throws for a total of 16
points, but despite. their dogged
persistence the visitors were un-
able to turn the tide of victory
their way.

The passing and general ball»
(handling of the home team in
the first half was often unsatis-
factory and at times poor. in
the latter half of the game.
however, there was
improvement. in view of the
team's disappointing capture of
rebounds in previous games,
Monday night's performance was
very reassuring, with Crowl,
Roegge and Susens doing a fine
job under the boards.
