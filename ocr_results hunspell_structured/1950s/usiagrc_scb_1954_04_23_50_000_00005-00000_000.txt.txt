Undefeated in two starts,
Grinnell’s tennis team will
travel to Omaha and Des Moines
to meet Omaha U. and Drake

[definitely the underdog in the
match and their hopes rest on
how many points they can gainl
in the lower positions.

Coach John Pfitsah plans to
take a five man squad to
Omaha this Friday and much of
the team’s chm depend upon
whether number one man Paul
Friend has recovered from a
recent serge of illness and can
make the trip. Blend has missed
practice this week and may not
not be able to compete in the
Omaha meet although he will
probably be ready for Drake.

Little is known of the Omaha

has graduated but the rest of
the squad is intact. Grinnell is

Gives Reduction
On Many Items

by Dave stemm-

-Most federal excise taxes have
been Cut and if you're in the
market for a'refrigerator or a
diamond ring, the chances are
that you Can get it for less now
than you could have on March
31. Federal excise taxes went
down on April 1 but there has
been no mad rush to the Grin-
nell appliance. eleotrieor jewel-
ry stores to get in on the bar-
gains. No one seems to mind,
least of all the Gn‘nnell mer-
chants.

As Roy deeper put it, “It
hasn’t made any diiference one
way or the other." He went on
to explain that the manufactur-
ers of radios, television sets, and
records had either absorbed the
cut, thereby not changing the
price to him and his customers,
or their prices had not been af-
fected, with the same result.

Gamble’s Cut Poppers

Keith Gregory, of the Gem
ble’s store in Grinnell substan-
tiated Leeper's View when he
said that he too had received no
word on any reduction on radios
and television sets. “But", said
Mr, Gregory, “we have had outs
in almost everything else, from
pop-com pappers to power
mowers."

He said that a long list or
small electrical appliances, along
with the higher priced items,
such as ranges and refrigerators,
have had half of the 20% tax
removed, These cuts have been
tlansterred directly to Hide con-
sumer. and a refrigerator that
cost $269.00 on March 31.now
sells for $259.00.

Yeager’s Cuts Jewelry

Jewelry stores were directly
ailected by the cut, and Harry
Yeager stated that virtually all
or his stock except his optical
line was reduced from 10% to

20%. The diflcrences in reduce,

ns come, for the most part, in
watches. All watches lover $65..
00 had a 20% tax on them
which has been cut to 10% All
watches under $65.00 had a 10%
tax originally, and this has not
changed Most other items, ster-
ling silver, gold, and all me
Claus stones were cut to 10%.
Even on leather watch bands,
the tax was cut in half.
Drugstores Get Cuts
Most influenced by the tax
cut was tthe drugstore, Loren

lHe read a list of luxury items
including all cosmetics. all hair
preparations, oils, shampoos and
home permanents, as well as
Imany articles such as toasters,
cigarette lighters, pens, cameras
and film.

Mr. West commented, ”We
paid what is pallad- e manu—
facturers tax on the cameras,
That is. instead of charging the
customer extra, we pay the
manufacturer. There really isn‘t
any difference, ibut when the
tax was cut, we were left with
a number of cameras for which
we had already payed the tax.
We couldn't get a rebate on
them, so Cunningham's is pock-
eting the loss." ,

The headlines on April 1 said
that the amise Cuts would run
into the billions, and. Consider-
ling the volume, they are pro-
bably right, but to the average
consumer, who does not plan to
buy a gas range .or a ruby
brooch, the tax reduction means
very little. Grinnell’s merchants
regarded the whole thing as
.something of a nuisance; they
had to take inventory.

George Mart, manager of the
Grinnell Theater Co», said, “In
order to maintain the high cali-
ber of motion pictures at the
Strand theater the price of .ad—
mission will not be lowered."
The excise tax reduction is
equal to about 7c,

Musical Review ----

'(cont'rnued from page four)
make it enmrtaining viewing. A
rather cute Madden-Floss song
about the carriage rule on the
castle grounds aids in making
this bit more palatable,

The second plsylet, a west-
ern “melly-drammer" contains.
by far, the wittiest dialogue, but
1 felt that it suffered from n
lack of drive on the part of the,
characters. It is concerned with
a prohibitive law on drinking
and contains a couple of charac-
ters who may or may not be
familiar to you. it is unfortunate
that it requires so much con-,
centration to cull the wit froml
the scene.

The third effort falls far be-
low the rest of the playlets. The
opening dialogue struck me as
rather insipid, and the dance
routine fell into the stereotyped
pattern of so much of the mod-
ern school of dancing. The one
bright spot in this scene was a
duet by Nate Johnson and Bob
Holmes, which appeared as the
second fine tune in the musical.

The final playlet regained the
stature of the first episode large-
ly through the method which
made the first section entertain-
ing—personality of the players.
The fourth playlet is aided by
Helen Jefferson who displays a
pleasant singing voice.

The interludes seemed rather
strained compared to the epi»
sodes despite Chuck Haynes’
animated portrayal of Fred, but
the finale was exceedingly good
and featured a delightful and
heartwarming closing number. ,

Tomorrow night with than
rough edges, apparent during
this viewing, smoothed off. the
student musical should prove to
be a pleasant and light-hearted
evening for the entire audience.
