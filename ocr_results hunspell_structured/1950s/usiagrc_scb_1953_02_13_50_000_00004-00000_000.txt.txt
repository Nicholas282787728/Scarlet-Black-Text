A few weeks ago I read in the Carleton newspaper that
Coach Mel Taube’s biggest problem was to find two consistent
forwards to match the sterling performance of his guards, Rosen-
blum and Slocum.

. He’s found half the answer in Bob Buis, a Crack shot and
drive—in artist, who now leads the team scoring, although he
didn't even start in the first games of the season

_ But Grinnell has a problem just like Mr. Taube’s, only
slightly reversed. stumbaugh and von Maur have been very
steady, but John Pfltsch’s guards have had their ups and downs
all season long. They’ll havesto is: up tonight.

The Pioneers can win tgnigléb—And I think that they will.

While all the attention is focused on the cage battle tonight,

the season tomorrow against
Carleton. ,

The Carts, behaving as though they are afraid of someone,
have steadily refused to publish the results of their meets, keep~
ing everything very secretive. Maybe Simone’s crew, unbeaten
in five starts, is the reason. , , ,

Coach Bobby Woll of Monmouth was the best sport in Darby
gym last Saturday. He could have had his team stall, thus hold-
ing the score under 100. But he didn’t, and Grinnell fans got
a wonderful thrill instead,

After the game Woll came over to Pfitsoh at the Grinnell
bench and asked, “Are you happy?" Pfitsch was speechless.
