Bcioi-e thc warm-up meet this
afternoon, Coach Simone wa:
satiillcd with the manner in
which his relatively inexper-
iencctl squad had adjusted to
the tall workout l‘otltlne. The
ten Pioneer cross country men
returned to school Sept 12 to
begin practice and twice a day
since men have been building
and let‘onditioning their bodies
in prcparation for tho long run.

The team is marked by n
dearth of returning letterinen
(captain Charles Yank and
Lou Sachs are the Llnly letter-
mcn back). but the presence
of n number ol promising ~un-
iiors who have not previously
lettered paints :i picture of
gcnernl optimism.

Senior Fred Boughcy and
juniors Chris King, Walt Neevcl,
and Art Kisser are all spring

Last year the hurriers were

Th' year‘s squad is out to

previous yeais. and if the spirit
of the boys and the willingness
to' train and discipline them-
selves are any indication of suc-
cess then they Will very likely
achieve this goal.
