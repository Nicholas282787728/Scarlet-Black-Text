The Social Skirmish—Part III

Need For Some “

End Of Publii

by Bill McClung l

Acting Dean oi Woiiien Dor-
othy Burma has written a let-
ter to the editor which appeals"
on page 2 pi this issue. We We1>i‘
come her direct and detailed;
statement oi her position, and‘
it seems necessary only to add
a few comments,

Mrs. Burma’s letter seems to
emphasize two points. First, she
states that the Grinncll stu-
dents have not displayed a
readiness and ability to accept
social responsibility as has been
exempliﬁed primarily by their‘.
ragged adherence to the rea-
sonable and necessary regula-
tions demanded by the liberal
extension of \vomeh's hours. Her
second major point is that due
to this irresponsi ility and to,
the added embarrassment caused‘
by a small number of couples
who insist upon a distasteful
display oi passion unfettered by
the public eye, it would be une
wise to open the dormitory
rooms.

On many points we must
both willingly and unwillingly
agree with Mrs. Burma. it is
certainly true that “we should
grant ireedom to students in
direct proportion to their so~
cial awareness." And the its
responsibility displayed by the
late girls alter hours on south
campus as well as the increas»
ed ircquency oi weekend
drunkenness on north campus
are certainly not examples of
a genuine social awareness. it
is sad and uniortunatc that
the very people who might be
interested in taking advantage
of the increased freedoms are
the people who may cause the
annihilation oi the limited ad~
vancements already made.
on the other hand. we are at
variance with her letter on seve,
eral crucial points. She ,refers

to the public display oi emotion
which is both distasteful and
embarrassing to other people,
Then she suggests that within
private rooms, these displays
would go further and to the
increased embarrassment of the
casual daters. BUT, isn’t it oh-
vious that it the rooms were
“private" then there wouldn’t
be a collection oi the public to
And iurther—
more, isn't it likely and even
probable that the present “pub—
lic" displa of certain very nate
ural sexual instincts is the re—
sult of the very lack of “prh
vats" places to go? i

She then raters to, “alas, the
fate oi the non-dater.” Yes, con-1’
sider iurther the iate of the;
non-dutel‘. First, the opening of
the dormitories would mean that,’
ior several short periods oi the;
week, they would have to dress,

manner Certainly this would
not be so horrid, and one might
even venture to say that it
would be beneﬁcial to both the
individuals and the halls, More-

ing of the dormitories {and
surely not all on thesc grounds),
would seem to indicate that the
grcat majority oi the Grinnell
students are willing to make
this not-so-odious sacriﬁce of
sloppy behaviour tor the sake

iof a more mature and satisfac-

tory social system,

The expected reply to all
of this, as Oberlin college has
aparently stated, is that the
college is under no obligation
to provide private netting
places tor couples. This is
true, but we icel that the
college is certainly under a
very deiinite obligation to pros
vide private places where
couples can read, talk. listen
to music or merely he alone
together. We will not be so
naive or dishonest as to say
that petting. etc. will not go
on in these private places:
Nor can those who oppose the
open dormitories he so naive
as to suggest that these things
will not'occur anyway.

So, what would be the result
of a denial of the proposed
open dormitory system» it would
on one hand mean that the coin
lege had not openly sanctioned
a current practice that will go
on anyway and on the other

hand that they had openly de-
riled an improvement that \Vauld
supplement the present social
program which is a bit crass, a
bit too restricted, a’bit inade-
quate, a'bit too “public." And
look. what is this but a matter
oi saving face? And to whom
do we need save face? The par
ents? Certainly ii there are par~
ents who are operating under
the delusion that sex is a relic
of yesterday, then perhaps they
need to be shocked. But we can
not think that parents of Grid
nell students are actually so un-
aware . . . of course they are
not. The opening oi the dermis
toria for limited dating pur
poses will mean a tremendous
benefit to the students in a
strictly social sense, and as well
it will appear that the college
is sanctioning a practice (the
indulgence in sex) which is
perhaps (only perhaps) undesir—
able. Need we save iacc by in—

convenience?

Rec/ding, Marcy See (1.5. Policy

by Stan Reporter

Last weekend, in conjunctionl
with the Afi‘oeAsian contcrenee.i
Saunders R e d din g, professor
of creative writing at Hampton
institute, Va, and Carl M.
Marcy. Chiei oi Stafi, Senate!
Committee on Foreign Relations.
spoke on various aspects of the
problems involved in the West’s
relation with the nations oi
More and Asia.

Redding, in a
series, "People, Policy. and
Propaganda", dealt with the
psychological and cultural coun-
terparts to the economic and
political problems of the eoun-‘
tries in Africa and Asia. Marcy,-
in a speech last Satur-
day night, spoke on “The Am-
erican in Asia with Gun. Check-
book. and Constitution." in his
talk, Marcy justified in many
rcsprcts the present foreign pol-
icy oi the United States in Asia.\

Saunders Redding’s criticism
and discussion of Western polie
cies and attitudes towards Airica
and Asia presented the problem
from the viewpoint of the
ideologies and aspirations of the
various nations in the Aime
Asian areas,

One problem in AfmeAsian
relations is the fact that the pol—i
icy statements oi the United
States are not always the same
as Llie actions that iollow.
“While our propaganda stresses
on idealistic desire to help back-
ward peoples and under-devel»
oped countries, our actions
sometimes indicate that we
look upon power as the key to
unlock doors to American in-
fluence.” .

Because oi the feeling oi sue
periority, and the reputation
that the West. including the
U.S., has tor exploiting and de-
nigrating the colored peoples of
the world, Russia has an initial
advantage in the struggle for
the minds of the uncommitted
peoples oi the world.

This struggle to win these
nations is a m ral one: a
struggle between the ideas of
democracy and the ideas of
communism While there. can
be no neutrality, there is neu-
tralism which is a means to
neutrality. Again the failure of
the West to comprehend the
meaning and importance of dais
neutralism presents a problem
in East—West relations. Redding
said that neutralism is a state
of mind where the great moral
issues involved in the cold war
larc straddled by showing no
appreciation tor gitts or aid from
leither side.

He stated that the US, is hot

”Any nation that can be

Certain aspects at foreign aid
