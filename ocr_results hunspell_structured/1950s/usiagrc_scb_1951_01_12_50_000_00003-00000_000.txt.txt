SCARLET AND BLACK

Stevens Opposes UM T

By Samuel N. ,steveiis

I iind fault wrth much ot the
superﬁcial and dangerous think—
ing which is being given expres
sion in newspapers and maga-
zines concerning the role of
higher educatio‘n in our national
lite,

Faith in Leadership

We, the people of the United.

States through-

t our national,

der conditionsof
great crisis. We

have placed our,

falth ultimately

at our national
leadership to
utilize fully
democratic pro
cesses for the
mobilization of

our natural
sources.

We have held steadily to
the conviction that the per»
mauent mobilization of our
economy would bring about
social and political deterior-
ation and ultimately destroy
our priceless ireedomi
As a nation we have

committed to
that no one thing could centric
bute as much to our ongoing
national life as an ever—increas—
ing level of social, political and
cultural literacy.

Education and Tradition
To instrument this faith we

have sacl‘lficially enriched the
formal resources for education
throughout the country. As a 1'67
sult we have been able to make
available in peace or war an
educated and a trained citizenry
equal to any crisis. This has been
our tradition.

Why, then, with all oi this
history in back of us should we
in a moment of hysteria sud-
denly lose faith in both our free
institutions and in ourselves?
The incredible has happened, for
there are many wise men who

Arl' Exhibil' Shows

The art department’s new ex-
hibit now showing in Main hall
is a series of industrial designs
from the American Institute of
Decorators. .

The exhibit includes art de—
signs with such things as archie
tectural designs and new tab
rics, both woven, and printed,

made from synthetic materials.

The exhibit is to remain up
until Jan. 20 and .a continued
portion of the exhibit may he

the proposition

ixvould encourage us to sell this
tradition short at the presentl
time.

UMT Unnecessary

Wih particular reference to
.‘liigher education and the defense
lelfort, it would appcar that unie
versal military training or some
general national service law is
neither necessary as a mecha-
nism for meeting our defense
requirements nor desirable in
terms of our social and political
tradition.

The needs of the nation
for educated, highly trained
men and women for both
civilian and armed service
purposes is so great that no
program which prosposes to
eliminate it {or the majority
and postpone it for some is
a solution that can lie justi-
fietl on any grounds.

No facts which have so far
been presented by any of the
authorities in the government
justify the assumption that the
international crisis should be
slowed down or stopped entire-
ly.

Creative Program

In other words, military ne—
cessity and the longtime re~
quireincnts for leadership of the
nation in war or peace demand
that a sound, forward looking
creative program be developed
which will guarantee our mili-
tary services the disciplined
minds and the trained hands
which war requires and will
guarantee for the future of our
country those same values, plusi
the broader cultural literacy,i
which significant exposure tot
higher general education will‘
produce.

Tie sudden rash of quick-trick cigarette tests

may have caused panda-monium on the campus — but our scholarly

friend was unperturbed He pondered the facts of the case and decided that

oneputl or onesnili tests . . . single inhale and exhale comparisons are hardly

conclusive. Proof of cigarette mildness doesn‘t come that fast!

And that’s exactly why we suggest . , .

The sensible test — the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test

which simply asks you to try Camels as your steady

smoke — on’a pack otter pack, day after day basis. No snap

judgments needed. After you’re enjoyed Camels a
