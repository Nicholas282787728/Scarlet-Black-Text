Corners’rone, Sealed In I882,
Discloses De’rails Of Cyclone

A 76»year link with the past
”was uncovered on the Grinnell
college campus Thursday when
workmen tearing down the mu-
sic building uncovered a sealed
cornerstone box placed in the
structure, which was erected in
1882 following the disastrous cy-

clone.

Contents of the lead box,
which is six inches Square and
four inches deep, included the
July 19 and June 23 issues of
the Grinnell Semi-Weekly Her—
ald which included “extras"
giving graphic, detailed ac-
count of the June 17, 1882 cy—
clone which wiped out a fifth
oi the town and destroyed
both of the iowa (Grinnell)
college buildings. About in
persons were killed, including
two college students.

Also included were Copies of
the Grinnell signal of June 24,
and an issue of the Weekly iowa
State Register in Des Moines
which recorded the disaster in

full.

Three photos enclosed showed
how the college looked before
and after the storm. College
literature in the box included a
Commencement program (gradu-
ation exercises proceeded on
schedule despite the cyclone),
also copies of the 1881432 lowa
college catalogue, and the News
Letter, and campus paper.

A staunch prohibition pam—
phlet was in the box, indicating
a current of Grinnell feeling at
the time.

Three men, working at the
place where the containcr was
made, tucked in hand-written
notes, and another message
settled the origin of the box
as ionows:

“The box that contains these
papers was made by H H. Day

Aug.21,1882, at Herrick’s shop."

The music building has been
torn down to make way for
Grinnell’s new $1,200,000 li-
brary. Construction of the new
building will begin immediately.
