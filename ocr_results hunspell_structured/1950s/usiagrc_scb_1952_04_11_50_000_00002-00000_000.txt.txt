Eloi, Eloi . . .

To commemorate the Easter season, the editors llave'
asked Paul Klintz (philosophy and religion) to write to-
day’s editorial.

Christianity is thought to be largely the way of the
tender-minded, rarely the way of the tough»minded. It
is more common to hear of the comforts of Christian
faith than of the rigor of Christian fact. Much religion
seems to make the world appear as it should be by deny-
ing that is as bad as it is,

The value of these commemorative days of Holy Week
and Easter is to come to see that Christianity has in sym—
bol both the most vivid recognition of the fact of evil as
well as the most Vivid recognition of the faith in ultimate
good. The symbol of one is the Crucifixion, the symbol of
the other is the Resurrection.

vIt is sometimes thought to be irreligious to be tough-
minded; to recognize the fact of agony, death and despair,
This is false as it stands, at best half truth. Warrant for
this judgement is found in the words of Jesus from the
cross, a few words that are the only ones that have come,
to us in the language that he spoke. “And when the sixth
hour was come, there was darkness over the Whole land
until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried
out with a loud voice saying, “ELOI, ELOI, LAMA
SABACHTHANI?” (Mark 15: 33-34)

The faith of Christians is not properly one that ig-
inores despair, even the ultimate despai, ”My God, my
God, Why hast Thou forsaken me?” To have a faith that‘
ignores such a fact is to encourage and enjoy illusion. It
is dangerous to the conduct of life to ignore what one
does not like, what one cannot explain, what one cannot
fit neatly into a preconceived scheme of things.

One of the few reliable guides ill religious thought,
one who does not take the faith in the Resurrection with
out the fact of the Crucifixion, is John Calvin. He writes[
of the text ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI, “.
This as a true specimen of his infinite mercy, not to evade

that death which he so much dreaded . . . Iﬂst that he
might obtain an exemption from death, but tha he might
not be allowed up as a sinne for he was then sustaining
our character . . . , He evidently appears to have spoken
from the anguish of his inmost soul . . . .

It was necessary, therefore, that he should overcomel
that fear, which naturally and incessantly harasses all
men; which he could not do without contending with it , . .
Thus, by contending with the power of the devil, with the.
dread of death, and with the pains of hell, he obtainedi
the victory, and triumphed over them, that in death we!
may no longer dread those things which our Prince has}
destroyed.” (Institutes, II, XVI, XI)

World Charm of
this delightful island,

Bermuda must he very much

like our lizlic college. Certainly
it would not be imy ,cpcr to call
Grinnell an island, however un—

formidable than an ocean which
is crossed several times daily
‘by luxurious airliners and steam-
ships. ~

Grinnell on the other hand,
is slightly short of inaccessible,
at least to the majority of those
reading this column. Possibly
”inaccessible” is the wrong
“inescapable" might bet-
tcr suit oui~ situation.

The ad didn’t make it clear
whether or not the Bermudan
Eovernment has a ”Car rule" on
its statute books. That’s hardly
important. What does matter is
that this popular vacation spot
has done away with the stink-
ing fumes of burning gasoline
and the endless drone of whin-
ins, engines in favor of the fresh,
savory aroma of horses dragn

[ging squeaky buggies across the

cobblestones with a restful clip-
clap.

Bennudons, like Grinnellians,
also get around on bicycles, al~
.hough theirs are the skinny-
tired type with hand brakes
and little straw baskets. Ber-
inudans, like Grinnellians, were
also pictured walking in pairs,
although none of the Atlantic
island couple: had blankets slung
ov\er their sunlelined arms

The similnritics between Grin-
nell college and the island of
Bermuda are many, They have
both recaptured the atmosphere
of a past ngc while promoting
n return to nature and the clean
life. Some of the Bermudans in
the ad were pictured clutching
highball glasses but there was
nothing in the lent to indicate
that these actually contained
highballs.

This movcmcnf backward in
time has certainly found irs
supporters in places other than
Grinnell and Bermuda. although
these two places have exploited
it most notably Colleges and
country clubs all over the world
are setting admirable, if not
desperate, examples of flight
from the machine age.

Some of them have found it
difficult to locate cfflclenf pci»
Sonnel to administrate the proV
visions of this movement and
we pioneers might pause a few
moments to count our blessings
in this area. »

We nc Grinnell are privileged
to have the services of the kind
of administrative executives who
have successully oriented them-

‘selves in the past in order to.

preserve the traditions which
most of us reverse so sincerely.

They’re not the kind of impet-
uous zealots whose student
plans fol: pl'ngl and sophlsn
tlcfitinll constantly upscl the
tranquillltv of other, not so for-
tunate, institutions.

We nt Grinncli are further
blessed with n student body
which still places n strong value
on huml tv and pbcdicncc to
authcri . Few penal institutions
have becn able to cstnbhsh
through force, the order and
cpmpinccncy which we have
achieved at Grilincll through
the simple use of fear.
