C of HP Discusses Prepping,
Enlarging Allocalions to Halls

Prepping and an increase in
the amount or money allotted
to the men’s halls from the se-l
mcstcl‘ (Ce were the main topics
discussed by thc Council of
House presidents at their meete
ings on.Monday and Wednes—
da, evenings. .

with the addition of the
AFROTC to freshman programs,
some curtailment ol prepping
was suggested. The council rece
ommcnded the prepping problem
be left to the individual house
cu‘uncl‘ls.

A tentative plan for enlarge
ing the amount of money allot-
ted to north campus for hall so
cial events was devised by the
council with the assistance of
Dean of Men G. Lester Duke.
Of the 57.50 from each male
student's sem fee allotted to
north campus, $1.50 has been
put in the social reserve fund
and $6 per student has been
‘given to each hall for social
events.

. The new plan calls for a 50
cent allottment to the social re-
serve fund. the $1 being added
to hallfunds. However, instead
or straight per capita basis, two-
thirds of the $7 would be di~
, vided equally among all the

,third would be split among the
halls on a per capita basis.

This would considerably in
crease the amount ol money al-
lowed for north campus social
eyenis. Before being put into
ettect, the plan must he approv-
ed by Dean Duke and the ad
ministration, with final approv-
al coming from the social come
mince. s >
