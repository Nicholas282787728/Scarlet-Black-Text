First of all. 1 would like to
congratulate Gary Nolder on a
job well done as north campus
1M chairman and wish his
successor, Ken Pap, the best
of luck in the future. Ken will
be working with Tom Soper as
did Nolder, and the two should

Iorm a very effective combin—
ation.

A dark horse has jumped
to the lead in the 1M softa
hall race. Lightly regarded
Rnwson, behind the hurling
of veteran moundsman Tom
Eadie, is in the league lead
with a 34) record. Close be»
hind with just one loss are
Clark, Gates and Langan.
Personally, I believe the chief
contenders for the champion»
ship are Ram/son and Clark
in view of their pitching and
hitting respectively; however,
Gates and Langan cannot be
counted out at this early
point in the season.

Defending champion Cowles
has suffered three humiliating
defeats thus far, and its chances
of repeating are very slim;
however, improvement is in olu
der with the return of veteran
second-sacker Tom Hodgson, and
Cowles’ team may possibly
raise some eyebrows before the
season‘s end.

The 1M golf tournament
will be Monday and Wednes<
day at the Country Club. Each
hall will be represented by
four golfers, and the low
team total will determine the
‘ winner. Last year’s champ

Smith has lost two of its
golfers to the varsity squad,
so this year’s field is wide
open. 1 would like to remind
all golfers to be sure to re-
port at their scheduled tee
off time, because no one will
be allowed to begin later
than his scheduled time.

To look a little further into
the future, the LM. .track meet
will be held May it and 17 on
Ward field, This will be the last
I.M. sport of the year and may
be very important in the out.
come of the Kent trophy race.
Also, last fall’s tennis tourna-
ment will be completed within l
the next few weeks,
