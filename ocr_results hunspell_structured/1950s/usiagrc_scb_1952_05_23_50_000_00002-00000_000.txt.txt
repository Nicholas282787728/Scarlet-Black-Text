It’s Been Real...

Only one more to go.

Last fall when we would trudge wearily to the quad
from ARH on Thursday nights, we’d mutter, “Well, only
26 to go.” And we could picture ourselves shouting with
joy when we could say, “Only one more S&B to publish.”
But that time has arrived and we find that we’re shouting
with a little bit of nostalgia.

We have had an interesting year. It has been the first
time in S&B history that the paper has been co-edited.
The results have been clashes and controversies, cooperav
tion and compromises.

i Editorially We’ve been rather erratic. Although often
condemned at the beginning of the year for always being
against things, we've discovered that we said kind words
about Emory McNee, Jo Meaghe the Grinnell high school
band, the cheerleaders, Jim O’Brien, Nellie Gleason, Lora
Lee Pugh, the nine homecoming candidates, Paul Kuntz,
Elbert Morse Smith, Col. Howell, Dean Duke, Mr. Clapp,
Sgts. Shay, Merkel, and Anderson, Mr. Truesdale, Mr.
Knopf, the United food market, the phys ed department,
Mrs. Hammond, Mary Fisher, Margaret Hyden, the ROTC,
and school spirit.

Unkind thoughts went to Loose hall women, the men
of Rawson hall, south campus food wasters, and the youth
of Cowles. -

We Started out well with an editorial stating we were
being starved. It appeared the day before parent’s day.
We recommended family-style meals, unlimited milk, and
a dessert count of south campus. We’ve got the dessert
count and the extra milk got shifted to the noon hour.
And we aren’t exactly starving, so we’re quite happy.

We also condemned the poor fire alarm system in
Loose and were pleased to see a new bell installed later in
the year, We wrote about election procedure and the Stu-
dent Council followed through on our recommendation that
no telephone calls be made by future election boards.

We suggested a homecoming committee to be elected
in the spring with definite funds allotted for its use, Such
a committee is now being organized. We said the Student
Council should have the right to veto decisions madeby
Grinnell representatives at conferences. The suggestion is
now a part of the Student Council constitution.

We wrote about jelly, the new minute system, Presis
dent Steven’s 10 pm. homecoming edict, men swearing, a
book exchange, fund solicitations, and Grinnellian discons
tent. We even tried to launch a men‘s week, the kind where
men date girls. It wasn’t too successful, however.

It's been a year of letters to the editors Altogether we
received 34, 4 of which were addressed to “Dear Sirs:.” We
were congratulated for having “a great deal more spunk
and drive than in the last three years.” We were condemned
for our editorials which “represent the height 01" negative
thinking.” We were told to ”peer out of (our) ivory-padded
cell . . .”

But we have come through, and we have become inel-
lowed. And we think Grinnell is a great place. And We
hate to leave. Most of all we hate to leave the S&B. The
paper will be taken over by an almost all-sophomore
crew. You got a taste of their work last week when they
put out the whole paper. We wish them the best of luck.

We'd also like to thank the kids who worked with us
this year, Dee Sorenson has put in an average of 16 hours
a week on her job as copy editor, Hull Pothoven and Dick
Rigby have handled the thankless job of circulation man-
ager. Jim Hartley has managed the business angle. They’ve
done great work,

 

The commencement edition of the 8&3 will be mailed to all
students leaving campus early if they fill out the blank below and
place it in the 5&3 box in the bookstore.

To the edltol‘s:

This is to thank the molr’e than
250 pzople who made the blood
drive a success. The quota of
180 pints was surpassed by 5
pints with a total oi 185 pints
given between 9 am. and 3:30.
p.m. Credit should be given to
the 243 scheduled persons who
kepl appointments, lo the stur
dents in each hall who solicited
donors, to the student nurses"
aides who took temperatures and
pulses all ‘day, to the nurses
and m the vblunlcer Red Cross
women who took good care of
us, to the members of my com-
mittee whc helped send out
letters to parents, and to any
one else who helped in any
way.

For those who would like to
know the statistics, here they
lare. Two hundred failychreel
people kept appointments. Of!
these, 53 were rejected for red
sons ranging from anemia to
high pulse or blood pressure.
The girls beat the fellows, 126
to 33. Seventeen lacully wives
took part as did seventeen
townspeople who were Calledl
in when it appeared that the'
college did not have enough
Eligible donors. Originally about,
350 students slgned plcdgc cards
but 127 of these, 30 girls and[
97 men, were not eligible be-'
cause of lack of parental col-ls
sent. I think the reason for many
of these not coming is pretty
wellrknown on campus

The blood has started its
journey. Most of it will be used
as whole blood in Korea within
the next three weeks, and the
rest will be processed into
plasma. ,

I mink I express the feeling at
‘most of the donors when i say
pl feel as though I’ve contribut-
cd to a worthwhile cause. It
.is my hope that next fall the
bloodmobile will again visit the
Grinnell campus and that Grin-
nell students will again exceed
their quota.

Sincerely,

Mary Jane Bender

‘To the Editors:

As the first year of AFROTC:
training here at Grinnell ends,
1 think it quite proper to make
an honest evaluation of the mills
tary setup and its activities.

l for one, and i believe my-
‘self not alone, think that the
ROTC program has been a ster—
ling exhibit of poor lenchingl
practices, bad acting on the part
of the entire staff both in and“
out of class, and an overall dev‘
generation of the standards of
the college.

I admit that a lot oi us were
reluctant to see a military pro-
lgram invade a small liberal arts

we have accepted what lhe pro-
gram had to offer, despite .lhc
additional hours on graduation
requirements, and iakcn our
lralning to be reserve officers
in the Air spree in lhe best
spirit possible,

i am sorry to say that in my
Opinion. the other party in the
bargain, the ROTC staff, has
been a miserable disepppinlmenl.

i did not Come to college to
attend classes where the instrucs
tors do not have the command
of the English language expected
of freshmen I believe it not unr
{air to Expect college instructors
lb refrain lrom using "they is,

jwc was, and we is" terminology.

I also have little time for
teachers who resort to telling
about female Situations in force
lgl‘l countries. or to pul it blunt-
ly, to tel .ng dirty stories in
order to buddyrup to the inemv
bers of the unit.

The instructors alone cannot
be blamed, when their superior.
the head of the Grinnell ROTC
unit, deems it necessary to be.

sort to the same crude practices.

Last of all, for supposedly ma-
ture persons who have been
given the faculty title of his
structol‘ m the college, the vul-
gar language and obnoxious ac-
tions exhibited both on the golf
course and at the Three Elms
pretty well speak for them
selws. i think may arc inexcus-
able.

Please don’t get me wrong. i
don’t pretend to be one of those
“ivory tower" characters, but I
lhlnk that the ROTC program
at Grinnell this year has been
a combination of poor leaching
policy, poor taste, and simple ig-
norance.

At the first of this year, we
cadets heard a speech about how

the Air Force would separate!

the men from the boys. I think
the Separation has been made.

The Air Force got, the Grlnnell

men, and Grinnell got stuck

with the Air Force boys,
