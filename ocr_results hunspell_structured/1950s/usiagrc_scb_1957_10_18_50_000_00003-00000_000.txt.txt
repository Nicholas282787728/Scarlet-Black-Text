Sachs Leads Grinnell To Victory
As Thinclads Down Ripon, 34-21

A runner strides tiredly
through the gates at the far
end of the football field, fol-
lowed closely by a second
runner Who seems to be run-
ning more confidently and is
bent on overtaking the leader.
The Grinncll band breaks into
the Pioneers song, tor the second
runner wears scarlet and black
and is passing the leader in a
burst of speed to lead the Grin-

nell barriers to victory against
Ripon.

This was the scene less than
15 minutes before the football
game last Saturday as the
Grinneil cross-wimtry squad
defeated ltipon 21.34, Grin-
nell’s Louis Sachs leading the
field with a time or 16:36'5

Both squads, weakened by ill-
ness, were able to field only
five members each, the minimum
requirement for a cross-coun—
try team. The Grinnell rive were
John Welden, Walt Neevel, Art
Kisser, Louis Sachs, and Chris
King, and the final results iound
Sachs placing first, Welden and
Risser tying for third, Neevcl
and King placing sixth and sev-
enth, respectively.

As far as time performers
are concerned, the squad is
probably a little behind corres-
ponding performance by the

last year's squad at this time.
This is due to some extent to
the training lost by squad
members as a. result oi illness.

Tomorrow afternoon the Pio-
neers will be competing against
the 1956-57 champions, Carleton,
at Northfield, Minn. Despite the
loss of most or last year's var-
sity squad members, the Carls,
who had a strong freshman team
last year, will once again have
to be reckoned as a strong po-
tential conference darkhorse. The

Grinnell squad has also lost
quite a few of its varsity mem-
bers, and the Outcome of this
meet will give Coach Irv Si-
mone an idea of the competition
he will have to face at the Con-
ference meet in November.

This
gridders

weekend the Pioneer
travel to Northﬁeld,
Minn, to iace the conference
leader, Carleton. The Pioneers
are still faced with a man.
power shortage due to the flu.
There were, however, no ser-
ious injuries suiiered in the
Ripon game last Saturday.

As of practice on Tuesday
there were 11 regulars, out of
27, down with the ﬂu. Topping
off the sick list: are John Cope-
land, Larry Dukes and Bruce
Wilkerson. There are several.
others that have not yet fully

recovered from the illness they
suffered last Wese

One good note is the re-
turn of Dave Allen and Jack
Michelleto. Both boys have
improved rapidly from the
injuries received in the (Joe
game. Coach Peterson is hop-
ing they can both be used in
the game Saturday against
the Knights. However, Peter
son stressed they would only
be used tor limited action

Carleton will be seeking their
ﬁfth straight conference victory.
Last weekend they defeated Coe
20—14 in Cedar Rapids, and
dropped their arch rivals—St.
Olaf—on the previous weekend.
Coach Warren Beson is hoping
to place the brunt of the Grin-
nell game on his second—string-
ers, but hasn’t: yet decided. Be-
son did say in a Carleton news
release that he couldn’t see
much of a contest in the Grin<
nell game.

The Carleton big-gun this
season is Al Schumucker, a
haliback from Minneapolis.
Last weekend against the K0-
hawks Scbmuoker racked up
a total of 134 yards and nor
counted for all three of the
Carleton scores. The halfback
has now scored a total oi at
points, second among the con-
ference top ten.

Looking at the weekend ob-
jectively, it looks as it the Pio—
neers will have a rough and
tough so minutes against the
Knights. There is a good pos-
sibility for an upset, but un-
less the Grinnell team can
reach new heights and play
better football than has been
played this season. the chances
are not too great. If the Grin-
nell team can score ﬁrst and
capitalize on the breaks they’ll
come back with victory No. 2
under their belts.
