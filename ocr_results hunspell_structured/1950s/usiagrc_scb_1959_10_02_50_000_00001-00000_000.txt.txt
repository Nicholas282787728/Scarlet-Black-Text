Hell Night To Clilllax Activities

by Pat Huber

Prepping has been modi-
fied. “Hell Night” has not.

been moditied both in regard
_to time and stronuousness. "Hell

There will be two or three

The prepping traditions of thel
separate halls vary considerably.

Several halls have cased thei
programs in recent years.

i
"Hell Night” procedure is alsol
largely dependent on the tram
ditions of each llall.sde of HF:
president. Dick Ramsdell. ancll
little nttempt‘is made to .iullill
the orientation purposes of prep.1
ping. i

l

Earl F. Pcisner, dean of i
.men, said, “Hell Night" has i
‘iess to do with the stated ub-
jectives of prepping than any
other part of the program.”

He said that this year’s pro-
gram represents a compromiseI
between traditidnrand reform.
While the prepping program it.
self has been shortened and
modiiieol, tew if any changes
have been made in "Hell Night."
Peisner said “I have no desire
to change ‘Hell Night' unless the
assignments become too ridicu-
lous or dangerous."

 

Perhaps 'one of the
amusing aspects of “Hell Day"
will be the costumes that preps
will wear to their morning

more ‘

classes, tomorrow. This year, any ‘

costumes which would illterierei

with class have been ruled out.

Tomorrow atternoon, preps
will be required to shine uri-
perclassmen’s shoes and do ,
various other tasks for them. l
Ramsdell said, however, that ,
it is hoped that this year the l
projects will he more construe» l
tive, “like-doing yard work l
or washing windows at one
oi the old people’s homes in
Grlnnell, or earning money
for the halls. We hope there
will he no hazing tomorrow
aiternoon." i

As to whether or not this,
year’s rcvrsed program has.
achieved its goal of integration.
and orientation. both Peisnel'
and Ramsdcll said that it was
too early to know. Peisncr said
the only urea
prepping acti itics could be,
