Slants On Sports

iCi-innell still has a mathematical chance of winning the Mld-
west conterence‘haskethall championship, but the odds are pretty
' poor. The battle for first has narrowed down to three teams, Carle-
ton (571), Cornell (7-2), and Grinnetl (472). Right now it looks
like Cornell has the best chance to cop the crown, and Grinnell the
worst.

The Rams have only three games lert to play. and none of
these are against the other two contenders. Grinnell and Carle-
ton, on the other hand, face each other at Grim-tell next Fris
day and then must each play five more conscience tilts.

1i the Carls heat the Pioneers next week, it will accomplish
two things First, it would mark Grinnell’s first delcat at home
this season, But more important, it would almost positively elims
lnate Grinnell from the race.

Regardlas how the Pioneers end up this year, one can’t help
noticing the tremendous improvement at this year’s squad over
that of last season. Last year at this time, the Scarlet and Black
hoopsters had a record of three wins, nine defeats, and were wal-
lowing deep in the conference cellar.

Now they have a season mark of 15, hold a strong third
place in the standings, and have won ﬁve of their last seven
clashes. statistics clearly illustrate this improvement.

Just one year ago, the Pioneers had just dropped their fifth
game of the last six, were averaging 55.3 points per game, shoot-
ing 33.1 percent on field goal attempts, and had managed to score
over so points in a game just three times. Their biggest point
production was 64 against Coe. Only one player had better than
a ten point per game average . Winter's 12.3. And Gardiner
Dutton had scored the most points in a single game » 21,

The current Grinnell outtit has been held under (to points
only three times, is shooting a highly respectable 38.7 percent, has
a 71.5 offensive average, and reached a season high or 90 points
in a prEChrlstmas game with Cornell.

Three boys have averages in two tigures: Winter (15.1), von

iMaur (14.3), and Stuanhaugh (10.2). Winter has topped ‘Dutton’s
mark five times and von Maur has heaten it twice and matched
it once. .

Coach John Pfitsch asked me to express his appreciation to
the multitude of Grinnell students and faculty members who made
the trip to Cornell last Tuesday. Ptitsch said that he and “the
team were very grateful tor the fine support of the fans."

Pfitsch wasn't the only person somewhat surprised by the
large number of Grinnellians which almost half tilled the tiny
Cornell gymnasium. Dean of Men Hank mom was slightly aston-
isher to see so many ”hitchhikers” there.
