To the Editor:

I appreciate the fact that Mr,
'l'rave , after nine months or
column- ting, has finally be
tome aware that there is a lib
' v magazine on campus,

Mr, Travers writes rather wit—
my and wcll. It is surprising
that a pcrson of hi talents
would never have uiittcn any-
thing which he might have
wanted to submit to MAVE-
RICK. Poi-hops ho is too mods
est to let us see his work. Or
perhaps hc tools that we should
heat a path to his door asking
for material. Or perhaps hc
luc conlidcnt oi s’elling arti-
hlos directly to tho ATLANTIC
MONTHLY and skipping the in-
termediatc stagcs. Or perhaps
he feels that Grinncll has’ no
need or a literary magazine.

l-Iis behavior is pu77ling:
ilirst therc i his long . cncc
about matters literary, and now
his criticism of the idea cl
MAVERICK because ccrtain
items it printcd do not happen
to titillatc his obviously very
.rciincd tasic.

About this taste OI his; he
compared MAVERICK’S new
cover to a corset advertise
merit. Now perhaps he is un-
familiar with the principles DI
the Rorschach inkblot test.
What he sees in nn inkblot or
an abstract drawing may not
lleccssal'ilv bc uhnt is there.
but may just go to show wlmt
he thinks tlhllut most oi the
time.

Spcaking only as an individual
and not as canditor of MAVEV
RICK, let me say that Bob
Dickinson and i are editors only
until scmcstcrs and that Mr,
Travers is v-c comc to apply
roi- thc editorship next year il‘
be Tee's ho is better qualilled
than wc arc. I doubt that ho
will; it is much easier to crit-
icize than to perform Besides,
he probably has other and
more important campus posi-
tions in mind: do you supposc
that he could be trying to
make MAVERICK a campaign
issuc7

Recentlv I rciuarkcd to a
lriend or Mr. Ti- icons that sinrc
MAVERICK ha tried to print
at least a 40-pagc magazine
curry timc, (he ovciull qual-
ity or each itsuc dcpcnds lo ge—
Iy on how much nmlci-ial
tunicd in. So now Mr. Travcis
states that “The cditor coin—
plain that they are hard-pl
cd for material.” II Mr. Ti

titan what he wish they had
said. ‘

Mr.

Travers comments on

rather:

only 11 pages of thc recent
MAVERICK; might it be that
he did not 'reiid the other 37?
Certainly a good columnist
should be able to review a
magaziiic issue selection by
selection. This procedure
would be good ior MAVE—
RICK and for Grinnell,

Such a review was attempted
last year: although it hurt cir—
culation, it was probably on the
whole bcnchcial. And the a“.
thor oi the review iollcwed
it up by recommcnding to us
some good material. much oi
which we latcr printed.

Mr. Travers seems to have
had another purpose in mind;
he wished to rouse rabblc, to
discredit MAVERICK so that it
would close down. Pct-hops he
wishes a return to the Good
Old Days when the campus lit-
crzi v magazine was run by anti
lor the bencht of a particular-
clique, This purpose is unworthy
of a columnist who claims to
wrilo with the intci-csts ol Grin
ncll at heart. II he does not
like MAVERICK as it is, I wish
he would constructively sug-
gest changes since I for one
have ccrtainy made my share
or mistakes and need to be
taken to task For them.

Since he made no positive
suggcstioiis. I ieel that Grin-
nclliiins uill do well to recog-
nize that (as the name im—
plies) “The Sound and The
Fury" signiiics nothing. Nothr
ing. that is. but the contempt
of its author ior the charts of

inbs ho is above do-
in; himself.

Certainly them should also
be a place for Leltt‘rs to tho

I would likc to usc this column
as a deicnsc against Some let-
tcrs which I havc rcccivcd

In the first place I never

claimed that my column was a
review of thc MAVERICK. It
was merely a cism or cor-
tam sections which I rclt wcrc
in extremely poor taste and as-
such it must stand or fall. (I do
not imply that the magazine is
all bad. The printing tcchniquc
is improved and ports had a
great deal to recommend
thcm;e.g. Demitasse.)

For the most part, however, I
choose to let the reviewing be
done by members of thc Engr
lish department inasmuch as I
feel they are better qualified
to judge work as to literary
moi-it. This, I belleve, was
proved by the intelligent and
sympathetic rcview written by
Norman Springer last year.

But to take up Mr, Hastings‘
letter point. by point, let me
say first that, surprising as it
seems to him, 1 have never
wirttcn anything which I have
desired to have printed in
MAVERICK. This leaves Mr.
Hastings holding several supposlv
tions which hc may dispose of
at his leisure.

Mr. Hastings the“ launches
into a psychological study of
my taste, which he first cnlls
reﬁned and then suggests to
be vulgar. I will match my
taste against anyone who
thought “Kiss" was worth
printing.

Mr. Hastings claims. in his
next point, that I misquoted him.
(Direct quotes were never used
but I'll overlook that.) May I
ask Mr. Hastings why it was
that at three o'clock in the
morning on the date of publicar
lion he found himself with one
blank page and dccided to print
“Kiss" on it? Ii, indeed, he is
not hardvpressed for material,
why- should he use this excuse
for the cartoon? If, instead, he
had an abundance oi material.
arc we to assume that he re
jcctcd some oi it in pi-ctcrcnce
to "Kiss 3 I would be interested
in answci to these questions.

Then, Mr, Hastings accuses mc
of not having read thc rest of
the magazine. This is not true.
I read the magazine in its ens
lirety (with the exception of the
last Iour pages or Mr. Hastings
story, which somehow I could
not bring myscll to wade
through).

Mr. Hastings then slips once
again into the mire or mud
and comes up slinging it. He
accuses me oi trying to muse
rabble. I don’t consider the
Grinncll Student Body rabbit:
and I don‘t believe they need
rousing about MAVERICK.

He feels that I hero oIicrcd
no constructive criticism I am
under no obligation to do this,
but I llill rcpcot \thil MY,

LITILE MAN ON CAMPUS

November 4, I955

by nick Bibler

”AFTER LOOKING 0/252 YOUR GRADES I'D SAY YOU BOTH KN)
SEVERAL FACTORS WORKING AﬁAWSI YOU ‘ THE FACULTY.’

Hastings has been told many

times and I hopc’this time he
takes the advice to heart.
Democracy is a fine thing but
when you come to literature it
falls down. It is slicer-est fully
to believe that evcry human
being is equally talented when
it Comes to creative writing. The
editorial policy at MAVERICK
is based on this talsc premise,

In order to have a worthwhile
literary magazine you must
rank the work and includc only
what is good. That which doesirt
meet the rigid qualifications set
up must be rejected. By doing
this you will guide the person
with no talent onto trails which
will lead somewhere for him.
You will help those persons who
have talent to find it and ex-
press it and you will raise the
calibre of your magazine.

A policy at universal acccpt-
mice has never raiscol the qual<
ity of work. Thosc persons who
have ability will either let
something ride which they could
improveior withhold it, tearing
that the rest of thc magazine
will be of much poorer quality.
It is the Job or the editor to
judge the material, II you don't
wish to do this, or honestly
feel that you are unable to do
it, then you should resign as
editor and turn the job over to
someone who will execute it
with credit.

You should not icel that you
are obligated to fill forty pages
each issue. The students would
rather see twenty pages or
good material than forty pages,
twenty of which are good,
and twenty cl which are poor.
