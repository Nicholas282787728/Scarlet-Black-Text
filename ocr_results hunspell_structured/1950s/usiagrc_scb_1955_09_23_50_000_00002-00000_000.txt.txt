Over Two Thousand Dollars

This Week proved quiet on the Grinnell campus. No
one broke the car rule, no one was caught drinking, and
on the surface things looked pretty dull. Then you began
to hear people whisper to each other about coming events.
Rumors of all sorts were flying, some of them were veri-
fied in this paper and others probably will be in the near
future.

One of the main topics of discussion is how will over
two thousand dollars of social fees be spent. Never has the

campus been so divided as to this question. In the follow-
ing issue a survey will be taken of the student body asks
ing their opinion

It will be up to the students to decide whether they
want that money to go for Lake Acre, name bands, to the
separate social committees, or any other whim that strikes
their fancy.

As we have said before, we hope this is the year when
students will take a greater interest in the government
around them. They all have opinions. they all like to talk
among themselves, but in the past only a few have been
willing to step forward and make it known to the campus.
By next Friday we should be able to tell whether students
are interested or merely stolid.

of education for occupations that require high intellectual
achievement,” President Howard R. Bowen declared Wed-

nesday ill his first chapel talk s

He asserted that ”there is a
woeful lack of understanding as
to just how a liberal arts edu-
cation contributes to success in
a career. This kind of education
is frequently rejected on the
ground that it is not practical,
that it does not fit you to do
anything."

False Vie-w

rcinung out the fallacy of this
View, Bowen stated that “a libs
eral arts education is the found-
ation of professional education,”
and that it is a long-established
and universally accepted prac-
tice to inquire a liberal arts eds
ucauon as the foundation for
professional training in medi-
cine, law, theology, Iesearch, and
college teaching.

“Business looks primarily ior
competent men and women—
not for persons who have stud-
ied particular aspects of bu '~
ness,” he declared. “Gradu-
ates of liberal arts colleges are
in great demand by business
firms, nnd business leadership
has repeatedly asked for in-
creased emphasis on liberal
arts subjects in undergraduate
business schools.”

There is a transition, Bowen
said, in the field of engineering
from requiring a large number
of technical courses. “The lead-
ing engineering schools are shift-j
ing to the 3-2 plan under which
students complete three years of
liberal arts before entering en-‘
gineci-ing school for two years."

He also mentioned that there:
is increased interest in more
liberal arts training for persons
entering the fields of pharmacy,
nursing, social work, and govern-

ince assuming the presidency.

ment service.

Bowen told the assembled
students that “nul' purposes are
to prepare you for a. useful ca<
reer, for wise leadership and
service in society, and for a
personally satisfying nnd
worthwhile life."

Sets Goal

The job of Grinnell college,
he said, “is to produce capable
and sensible young men and wo»
mcn . . , will) have the personal
qualities of intelligence, freedom
of the mind, ethical understand-
ing, aesthetic appreciation, self-
discipline, leadership, wisdom,
and health.” He emphasized that
all cf the college‘s facilities, per—
sonnel, courses, athletics, extra.
curricular activities, and social
life are designed for this pur-
pose.

“Education is a lifelong process
which you stancd long befci-e
you ever entered Grinnell and
which it is your duty in contin-
lie so lnng as you live,” he said.
“The most we can expect to do
here is to further the proce55#

directions.”

The boundaries of bile town
of Grinnell seem to be rather
nebulous. The c of HP has one
definition (in regard to the cai-
rule), the League Bani-d has an-
other, and the Grinncll city
council has still a 1h|rd.lt

solons will alter theirs, but it
might be a slendid gesture on
our part to redeﬁne ours and
eliminate some confusion.

fryer. bf I were in charge of
this, i would probably fix com-
mon middleclass dishes such as
French4ried potatoes, French
fried onions or French-fried
shrimp. That shows how much I
know.

The incomparable imagina-
tion of our culinany wizards has
already conjured up French.
fried cauliflower and vast hor-
izons seem to be coming into
view. Such foods as French-
fried applesauce, Frenchsfl‘led
soup, and French-fried jello are
eminent, and the way P. r. G.
was eyeing the water cooler
makes me suspect that the great
piece de resistance is on its way.

I feel compelled to make a
possible superfluous comment
on this year’s prepping prc~
gram. Without question it is a
notable step in the right di-
recion, The prepping program
has always had as its goal the
integration of the freshman class.
in the past this goal has been
somewhat dbscured by blood-
thirsty cries for wholesale
swatting and by the ignoble aim
of demeaning the freshman by
outlandish getrups.

By limiting the swats to hell-
night only and by discarding
the costumes altogether, the c
if HP has shown a markedl)
mature attitude and a definite
ability to pare away the opaque
shrouds which threatened to
bury prepping before it had
finished an existence of use.

KGRw is preparing an ex-

perimental program which is
“Heartbeat," . patterned after
NiBC’s “Monitor." It’s aim is
to pl‘csent campus controversies
and various and sundry features
designed to appeal to the Grin-
nell student. We who are ccn.
nectcd with it hope it succeeds
in its purpose.
