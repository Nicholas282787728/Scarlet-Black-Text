On I-lall Issue
Monday Night

By Joan VanderNaald

The League Board will
take a vote of women stu—
dents Monday night to de
termine if there is enough
interest in integrated halls
to warrant experlmentlng
with ,them, Anne Beuck-
mam-l, president, announced
last night.

Distributed to all women will
be ballots containing the guess
tio : “Would you prefer to live
in an integrated dorm (fresh-
men, sophomores: juniors and
seniors) next year?”
Women Evelyn Gardner will
make the final decision on his
tegrated halls after the League
Board has determined the opin-
ion of the women.

A second open meeting to dis-
cuss integrated housing was
held Wednesday night in Main
lounge. The discussion centered
around leadership possibilities
in freshman dorms.

First impressions and baﬁle
board innuen were cited as
the main criti isms of ﬁrst sev
mester elections in the fresh-
man dormitories. In an inte~
grated dormitory system, if
ﬂoating members were elected
to house council, then fresh-
men would have a semester
to become acquainted with the
house council system. The cf»
fectiveness of planning proj-
ects with committees was
brought out.

A third possibility was to
elect two women to social, intra—
mural and Student Council posir
lions. 0f the two women, one
would be an upperclassman,
and the other would be a freshr
man. The freshman who would
be elected to Student Council
would have no vote at the meet-
ings, but she would have an
opportunity to acquaint herself
with student government.

Several freshmen Women
explained the importance of
having in the hall both a
house council which has spec-
ific jobs and a bnfﬂe board
who serve in advisory posi-
tions. The freshmen need and
want advice and, at first,
someone older with Whom to
discuss problems. The fresh-
men also indicated a prefer-
ence to room with another
freshman, not an upperclass.

Previously, the architecture
Committee had concluded that
freshmen Should not live in
triple suites or the basements of
Haines or Read.
