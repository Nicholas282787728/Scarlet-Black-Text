Specifically, the proposal asks
that the undergraduate chapter
program committee investigate
both sides of such disputes and
send its decision on the ease to
all undergraduate chapters of
SDX as well as to the president
of the institution involved, and

hoped that this procedure would
give editors and station mana-
gers more leeway in comment—
ing on college problems.
