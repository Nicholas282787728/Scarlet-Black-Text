The Social Skirmish~Part [1

Poll Shows Students Favor
Open Rooms; Lengthened Hours

by Bill McClung
Early this Week the 5&8 Cii‘culated a poll to ascertain the

attitude ot Grinncii students
existing social regulations.

toward possible changes
The following generalizations can be

in the

drawn from the replies which iapi‘esent 81 percent of the student

body: the Gilnnell students aIe

(l) heavily (87 Deicent of those

who answeied) In favor oi opening the doimiloiy looms {01 dal-

ing purposes at Certain designated hours

(2) generally in favoi

of the later weekday hours as presented to the women by the

AWS Board at housemcctings
last Monday night and (a) are
almost evenly split on the pos-
sibility or having no hours at
all.

The iact that it percent or
the students replied to the
poll suggests the degree or in.
terest In the problem; the
vine: that the replies were al—

‘mosr without exception ser—

ions, and thoughtrul suggests
the nurture approach that the
students have taken toward

this problem. ,

In regard to the question con—
cerning open dormitories on
North campus, the mcn indicated
310-16 that they were in favor
of opening the rooms ror dating
on‘ certain dates. On South Pani-
pus the agreement was not so
complete or 317,-i-eplies. 0.1 .p»
posed the open rooms proposal.

There were two general
types or arguments agaInst
the opening of tlie dormitories.
First, as a Loose girl emphat—
' IIy, wrote, “NO—my room
is a bedroom, not a room for
cntertalning men." It the Sug~
gcstions are instituted, it will
oi course remain the individ—
uals prerogative whether to
use the open room privilege
or not.

'lhe second. and more common
reason tor the rejection of the
proposal and tor some Skepli<
Biol“ toward ii, was that the
open dormitory policy would i
Iriiigc upon the privacy-or non-
dater- and roommates. Certain-
ly q ct hours and perhaps
other problems would have to
be cors cred, and as to'the
roominat ' is obvious that
mature, intelligent people can
make satisfactory compromises
on such a matter as thcy do on
every av problems.

Generally, however, students
were warmly In ravor oiopen.
ing the dormitories. They re-
peatcdli stressed the need
tor what was termed "an in.
formal. rel red and mature
atmosphere." "just to talk, to
listen to music. read. study, or
simply- to be alone."

A‘Ldngan reply addressed the
crucial point, “Let’s not be
naho about this. It we create a
plate tar couples to be alone,

there will be some emotions ex-
piessed but this is rai tram be-
ing immoral And, it there is
actual immorality, and those lnr
dutging are caught, who should
suit'er'r The obv-ious answer is
the couple that has overstep-
ped their moral boundslrlf a

couple is going to be immol‘al.,

they will do it with or without
open dorms. Why make it easy
for thenl‘.’ Why make it hard
for cvcryone else?"

As to the times for
opening at the dorms. most
