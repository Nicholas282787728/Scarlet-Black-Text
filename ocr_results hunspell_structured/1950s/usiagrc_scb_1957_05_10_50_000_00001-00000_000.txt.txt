“Plans for a new Gi'innell library are Well under way,"

The program determined by the committee now in-
cludes £1 description of facilities, lists of furniture and
equipment for each area, appropriate footnges, and the

relation of various areas of the
building, but not architectural
plans.

“Right now we have no idea
what the building will look
like,” said Bradford. The com-
mittee has met once with the ar-
chitects and will meet again Fri-
day, other which the design stage
will begin. The committee hopes
for a completed design by this
fall when a fund—raising cam-
paign will begin. The proposed
budget for the library is
$1,200,000.

Harvard Consultant Here

Also present at the Friday
meeting will be Keyes D, Met-
calf, librarian emeritus of Har-
vard university, who has none
sented to serve as a consultant.

A major question has been
where the library will he lo~
cated. President Howard B,
Bowen and the committee have
agreed that it will be on the
south side at the campus,
somewhere in the‘line oi
buildings Magoun—Blair—Music,
one or perhaps two at which
will be demolished. The Trusv
toes and Bowen will deter—
mine the exact site in the near
iuture.

The new library will provide
study space for 550 students,
About 350 at these Seats will be
for individual readers. Most
other study tables provide for
two or four persons. Almost one-
fifth of these Seats will he in one

Thc hookstacks will be coma

pletely open, except for the

where the college archives are

vide for 300,000 books. The
iloors in the stack area will be

ed.

Around the edges of the stack
area will be 136 small alcoves
for individual reading. There
will be eight “islands” in the

Bowen stated that the Concern
students had expressed showed
interest in the col-
lege. and showed that students
felt free to express themselves.
However, he felt that some of
the statements made were un-
justiﬁed. The administration and
iaculty do consider student
opinion and tradition,

The increase in enrollment
was made necessary by an
increase in the number oi
people who wish to attend
college, and an increase in
appreciation of thc liberal
arts college and Grime“.
More students will enable the
college to hire more iaculty
members so that there will be
at least three in each depart-
ment This oa'n be done with
no increase in tuition.

Next year the college is plan~
ning an increase of 70 students
to an enrollment oi 925. This is
not maximum capacity. Bowen
explained that rooms were
drawn for next year according
to the maximum because there
is no certain way oi knowing
if all the students whd applied
will actually Come, and if all
the returning students actually
return. He assured the students
that there will be adequate liv-
ing space ior each student next
year.

in answer to student opin-
ion about registration, Bowen
said that the new registration
plan has worked in other
small colleges, and he thought
it would have been a more
ehicicnt method to improve
registration at Grinnell. How;
ever, since students did not
favor the idea, a compromise
proposal was installed,

He explained that the special
convocation next fall will be
held to dramatize the iunctions
and objectives of liberal arts
