Final balloting will be held
March 21 and 22, in the R. O. T.
C. classes. The winner will be
announCed at the ball.

Music will be provided by The
Commanders, featuring Eddie
Grady, The band was conceived
by Camarata, composer for the
Decca Record Company. After
eroperimenting with various
types oi conventional orchestra
set-ups, he decided to create
new material in his new sound
category. He used 4 trombones,
3 trumpets. only 2 saxophones;
and «t rhythm pieces.

Instead of injecting a single
personality to lead the organiza-
tion, Camarata decided to inject
the personality into the entire
organization. Eddie Grady was
selected as leader, but the band
was named The Commanders.

Grady, while in the armed
forces, was drummer in one of
the Glenn Miller Bands. After
his discharge, he played with
Tommy Dorsey’s band for two
and onerhalf years, until his de-
parture to record for Benny
Goodman.

hours will be 12:15, but late pers
will be granted for l a. m. The
band will play until 1.

'Tickets for the fourth annual
dance are $3.50 per couple'.

“Although a strident in a
dormitory must be able to live
his own life, he must also‘ dis-
cipline himseli so that his cone
duct does not interfere with
others," he said. “That this is
not being done in Dibble is
shown by the large number
of disciplinary problems ig—
inating there, the poor di ing
conduct of the hall members,
and the low grade report of
the hall for the past three
semesters. rm very unhappy
with the situation," said
Brown.

“We have been hoping that
the students would be able to
correct the problems through
their own governmental organi—
zation, but it is quite apparent
that this is not being done. The
administration is therefore going
to be forced to take some ac—
tion to correct a situation we
feel is not beneficial to the in-
stitution.”

Split

No definite plan of action has
been agreed upon yet, but
Brown said that it will probably
start them scratch by splitting
up the present members of the
hall, finding people who are in-
terested in bettering the situa
tion, and letting them move in.
The final decision will be made
sometime this spring, and will
go into effect next fall, he said.

"Undoubtedly it is ordy a"
small core of people who are
responsible for the problem.
and not everyone in the ball,
but the difficulty is that it’s
almost impossible to tell whcfs
really responsible," be com.
mented. “Because of this, we
are forced to deal this way
with the whole hall."

When asked to comment on
the situation, C of HP president
Dave Ferguson stated that, “It
definitely is a bad problem, and
if Dean Brown feels that some-
thing of this sort is needed,
then I will support him”
