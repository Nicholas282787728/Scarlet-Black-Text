Lost Weekano End

We prepose a 36-hour day. Gi'innellians need it. Twen-
ty»four hour days are bulging around the edges Red-eyed
students wllo yawn from class to class, sentence to sentence,
and meeting to meeting are all for it.

- It seems that waves of activity swamp the campus from
time to time and it looks impossible to keep one’s head
above water. Unusual is the person who doesn’t have at
least three of the terminal hour exams in one week. At the
same time, socializing must reach new heights and depths
of intricate crepe papering, punch pouring, and floor wax-
ing. The only thingr we don’t have to do is press our
blankets.

Term papers are treading closely upon the heels of
exams. Students in the ninety-ninth percentile of the A. C.
E. exams are wondering if they’re college material, to say
nothing of lesser geniuses. Grad records, civil service, teach-

ers exams, and other extra—curricular surprises are rearing

their heads.
