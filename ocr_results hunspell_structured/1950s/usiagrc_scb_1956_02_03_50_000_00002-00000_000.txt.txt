SCARLET AND BLACK

February d. I956

 

Duane Crossley

Professor Duane Crossley’s sudden death cameas a
great shock. The tragic accident created a deep void on
campus, and in the hearts of all that knew him. Both his
personality and professional skills were so dynamic, that Stir
dents, whether studying under him or merely knowing
him, deeply appreciated and valued his presence at Grln-
nelll

We recall the memorable musical performances which
Mr. Crossley directed in the past two.years. His superb
direction of Gilbert & Sullivan’s “Yeomen of the Guard” left
a deep impression on us. His direction of Menotti’s moving
opera, “The Medium,” represented Grinnell theater at its
best. These performances were typical of the polish and
showmanship Mr. Crossley promoted.

Men’s and Women’s Glee clubs are another area in
which he devoted so much of his time and enegry. Under his
guidance, the men’s group had already started practice
for their Junior Chamber of Commerce sponsored variety
show, one of many evidences of the role lie-played as a
music ambassador of Grinnell.

We express our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Betty Cross-
ley and family. Mr. Crossley’s work will stand as a lasting
memory of a great artist, teacher, and man.

‘ Beginning A Year

,This issue marks the beginning of the new S&B year,
For most beginnings, there are usually promises or warn»
ings of what’s to come. We won’t do either, but We would
like to think alolld about our headaches. .

Greater news coverage will‘be one of our principle
problems. We are in the process of establishing for repor-'
ters a more professional approach to writing in order to
achieve full coverage. Reporters will now have assigned
beats, and will cover all the news in their areas. In this
manner, We shall be able to keep completely abreast of
campus affairs.

Realizing alld appreciating the fact that the S&B has
no prior news censol‘ship,,we feel a social responsibility to
print the news fairly and objectively. The administrative
offices have extended their cooperation. President Bowen
has shown interest and given suggestions for our work.
This cooperation shows no desire for domination. Many
colleges do not have complete freedom, for some degree
of faculty censorship is present. We value ours, and feel
that with freedom comes responsibility, so the problem of
remaining free, by being worthy of freedom is another one
of our headaches.

Mechanically, we’re tackling a few activities also. Our
budget will call for more pictures; and we will use as many
as money permits Pictures will also promote interesting
1rnalkie-up for the paper, alleviating a possible worn-out
oo .

We don’t feel sorry for ourselves because of all our
problems; however. In fact, We like them, for they present
a challenge which we find interesting. We’re looking for»
ward to your opinions about our success, especially con-
cerning our editorial discussion of campus issues. Letters
to the editor will be received and printed as space permits.

Perhaps we’re making promises after all, but we guess
it’s almost unavoidable Thinking aloud might be a dan-

gerous thing, for now you’ll know what to expect. But thisl

doesn’t stop us, we’re still looking forward to our year of
servrce. ‘

“See you at Cornell!” Next
Friday night is the night for
everyone to migrate to the
guazing territory of the hams.
Our basketball team is hard
after revenge and we must be
there to give them rousing sup.
port, It doesn’t matter how you
get there, just be there with
a desire to win.

For those who have no means
of transportation except for the
chartered busses, new incentive
has been added. The Council is
going to pay 50c of. the fare for
all those travelling by bus. An
Informal social affair is being
planned for the students of both
camipuses after the game.

Considering all, it promises

Va

to ’be one oi the gayest times
yet (it’s always fun winning).

The w, U. .5. drive next week
is very important and everyone
should not only’ contribute, but
should attem/pt to become ac-
quainbed with the program. it is
the only charity drive sponsored
on our camlpus all year and we
feel It is the most deserving.

This is the only drive of its
kind in which studenls are di-
rectly contributing for and Fbene—
fiting their less fortunate fel-
low students in the other yards
of the world. The money is dis-
creetly utilized and distributed
without favoritism and Iprnr
vides the most needed essentials
for educational institutions. W.
U. s. deserves your attention
and monetary support.

“See you around the caunlpi—
at Cornell.”
