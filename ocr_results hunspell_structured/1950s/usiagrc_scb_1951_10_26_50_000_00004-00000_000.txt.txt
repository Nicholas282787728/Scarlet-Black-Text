WSSF Launches Campaign-

To Help Foreign Students

Jiin Morgan, Fred Helpenstell, and Mary Grimm

officially

open GrinneII’s WSSF campaign as Nick Piedi'scnizi gives them IB-

ceipts for their contributions.

Mary Grimm, League board
president, Fred Helpenstell, c
of HP president, and Jim Mor-
gan, student Council president,
officially opened the campus
World Student Service Fund
drive on Monday, «by contribv
uting two dollars each to their
campus solicitors.

wssr is the agency through
which American students and
professors share materially and
intellectually with their needy.
contemporaries throughout the
world. _

The six dollars contributed by
Mary, Helpenstell and Morgan
is enough to buy two necessary
textbooks for a student in
Greece‘ whose library was de.
stroyed by the war. Or it might
provide hot breakfasts through
three months of winter for one
Austrian student suffering from
malnutrition.

Irene Gagaoudaki, a student
of the University of Athens,
wrote the following on behalf
of her university which received
bodks through the work of
wssr.

"I wish to be able to use a
word which would mean more
than ‘thank you’ for the gift of
books. student life is such a
struggle here that any kind of
help gives a Greek student
endugh hope to study a little
longer and try to live a little
longer. It is not actually the
gift that makes so much dlfv
ference but the fact that somnr
body care: for him and tries
to help." .

Need alone is the principle
