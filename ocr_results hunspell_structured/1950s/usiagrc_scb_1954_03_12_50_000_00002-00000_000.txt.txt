As Roger Perry prepares to hand over the Student
Council President’s gavel to a successor, note should be
. made of the progress student government has made under
his leadership. '
There is no All-College Council, which was the basis

of his campaign. There is no change at all in student gov-
ernment structure. But there is a proposed constitution
which, if adopted, will mean an excellent opportunity for
student government to develop into an effective body.
That three candidates have endorsed the proposed plan

(the fourth favors martial law) is gratifying. It is also a.
tribute to Perry and the committee he organized, which
.took former Dean Fuller’s comments on the Pomona and
gtsnfoﬁd governments and turned them into a. plan for

MOURNERS

by Ed Lulu;

The head ofﬁce in the buildings
and grounds department got its‘
signals mixed‘ again. i wonder
how many campaign signs were
torn down by janitors and other

employees before their orders
was changed.

It seems as though signs
around stairs constitute hazards.
It’s too bad the campaigners
wert‘n’t informed. The college
employees were merely impart-
ially following orders when they
pulled them down.

And when mhe BIG sign in
front of ARH was removed and
thrown away by the same group
i cupected anything but what
happened. What we got was a
complete denial- l suppose we
should have expected it.

lt'e time for a few well-de-
served bouquets, however. All or
us appreciate the courteous,
pleasant and efficient staff that
works in the library. And many
of us are grateful to the AF

By the way, where areilie
smfiers that used It! sneer at
Griunell athletic teams? They’d
sound sort of silly right now.
