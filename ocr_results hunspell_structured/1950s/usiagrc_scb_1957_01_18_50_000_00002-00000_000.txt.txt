Social Innovation

North Campus \i’ill hold its first "Winter Festival" in
recent years tomorrow, One of the posters advertising the
event states that it should not be confused with the Dart-
mouth Winter Carnival. This implies that the Grinnell festi-
val won’t be as elaborate, and won‘t be as successful. We
know it won’t be as elaborate, but it_can he very successful
if students would view the festival as a seasonal holiday
comparable to Spring Day activities.

Many complain about

oi:-

the social activities here, yet

refuse to attend an innovation in the social calendar. There

were complaints about the

Union Rathskellar party, before

it was even held. Those who attended seemed to be having
an enjoyable time. The party and tomorrow‘s festival pros
vide more variety for the social calendar.

We realize that term papers and end of the semester
studies will keep a great many from taking part in all of

the day‘s activities. However,
pate in the “Winter Festival"

year‘s, it could even grow to be as

Carnival.

we urge everyone to partici-’
as much as possible. In future twenty minutes.

“Under Milk Wood” is a play
for voices. it is something dit»
ferent in Grinnell dramatic prev
ductions, and it should provc

/to be the best of the year. The
six people in the reading cast
represent the best dramatic tal—
ent on tho Grinnell campus, and
the play itself has something to
appeal to everyoneifmm the
most ardent artistic intellectual
down to the person who reads
Shakespeare just to see the
cusswords in print.

Even it you’re a prude, be
sure to and listen care-
iully to every line. It will
give you something to show
righteous indignation about.

But why this antagonism
toward the 5&3? Golly, may
be we are just kids “playing
newspaper," but we TRY to
be accurate and tell the truth.
Sometimes, due to the limits
oi propriety and the necessarr
ily objective nature oi the
story, we can’t tell ALL the
truth. Is that what’s wrong?

Your charge that we “never
say anything good about any
thing" was obviously made un-
der stress, and I forgive you.
(Maybe you had a headache, or
the car wouldn‘t start that
morning, or the sc representar
tive trom Cowles hall had just
given you a rough time about
some radiator or other.)

Why, it should be obvious
that even i like some things.
in this one column alone, I
have expressed a liking tor
Dylan Thomas, his play, the
5&3, truth, and the delivery
of folding chairs. I could go
on and on with the things I
like. As a matter of fact, 1
like my liie at Grinnell very
much, generally. I like to
think that l like it enough to
examine what's wrong with it
and write about it. .
That reporter was one of our
best, Mr. Marble. rm sorry that
you look upon her and me and
the 5&5 the/way you do.

And rm sorry your tractor
fell through the ice.

dissatisfied with an aspect oi
the Grinnell social program, you
can personally act to remedy
the situation by offering sound
suggestions.

not enjoy the Duke Ellington
concert (Iiam told that there
were many who would fall
into this category),

AS I see the problem, the
people who did not care for
the concert fall into two
categories: those who do not
care for jazz, and those who
are the continual complainers
on the campus. I wish to deal
with the latter element.
Students, if you have a logical

basis tor your dislikes, why do
you not see one of the campus
officials who should be exposed
to the Criticism. You are the
very ones who complain about
.every little thing on this cam-
pus. only ior the sake of com-
plaining. If our football team
were to gain victory in every
game next year, you still would
have something to gripe about,
with respect to their season.

It is extremely difficult for
a small school such as Grin-r
nell to book name artists to be
a part of our social program.
Our funds tor these purposes
are— too limited.

Your Social Coordinator
worked long and diligently to
bring the Ellington hand to
our campus. He surveyed the
general slant oi campus

thought to obtain an attraction
that most of the students
would enjoy. He ﬂickered to
bring the price of concert to
a point Where Grinnell could
afford such a concert. Put-
ting 0n slloh an event as was
staged last Thursday evening»
requires a great deal of work,
I am confident that the Social

Coordinator would be more

Mr. Marble, I’m quite certain
that if we had known that that
two-ton tractor was being sent
out to clear ott the ice, you
would have had an audience of

it falling through.
