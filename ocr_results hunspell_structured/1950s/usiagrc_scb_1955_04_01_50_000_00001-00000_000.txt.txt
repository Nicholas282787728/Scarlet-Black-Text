C of HP Suspends
Two Students For
Drinking Violations

Two men students were sus-
pended last week by the c of
HP for violation of the drinking
rule, and two others moved on
campus.

A Cowles freshman, round at
the dance with a bottle, had a
week’s suspension recommended
by the c of HP for “drunk and

rderly conduct on college
property.”

“Possession of alcohol on col-
lege property" was charged
against a Rawson sophomore and
he was suspended tor a week.
Dean of -men Henry Brown
okayed the disciplinary actions

Brown also told t/wo leble
students to move off campus
after an incident at a Grinnell
hotel involving town police. it
was the only other choice bee
sides suspension, said Brown. it
was the first time he had ever
done this, he said.

Women's Halls
Vote to Buy
WaterCoolers

Dottie Fulton, League Board
president, announced that wo-
men’s halls have voted to buy
'atel' coolers with hhe money
ett over from the washing [liar
chine fund.

Norman Manolo (superintende
ent or building and grounds)
Dottie added, “is saving the
Quad considerable amount of
money, since he has ordered to
pay both the freight charges
from Des Moines and the instal—
lation costs on these water
coolers".

The water coolers will prob-
ably be installed sometime this
spring and have been ordered
through Westinghouse at a cut-
rate price of $165 each. They
will be placed in the entryways
of Cleveland, Haines, and Read
halls.

Dottie concluded that “the
purchase of these water coolers
was a very worthwhile thing to
use the money for, since the
buildings and grounds COmnll‘tec
couldn’t possibly afford it. The
girls in these halls have wanted
water coolers for a long t'rne
and while they don’t benefit
each hall, they benefit the Quad
as a whole".

“There has been no careful
appraisal" for a successor to
the post or dean of men, said
Dean Homer Norton, “since
Brown’s resignation does not
take effect until the end of
June." Norton said that no
decision has been made as to
whether the replacement
would be train on cmpus or
off. -

There was much speculation
on north campus yesterday as
to whether anyone on campus
was qualified to “hold down the
job.” One professor said, “there
are a few men who could do a
good job, but probably would
not accept the position. The
ones that want it probably
couldn’t do a good job of it.”

Well-Liked by most of the
men students, and respected by
a great number, Brown said
that he had enjoyed his work
here and was l“going to miss
many phases of working at the
college.”

Dean of men for three years,
Brown came to, Grinnell in 1948
and served as football and
wrestling toad: for foul: years
before his promotion in 1952.
