aPioneers In Big Rebound Effort
Against Powerful Rams Tonight

A beaten but not broken Grinnell basketball team journeys We a busy Weakend &‘ “they
to Mt. Vernon tonight to tangle with the powerful Cornell quintet.
A win in this revenge effort will bring the Pioneers abreast with
the Burns in the conference standings. The cagers then return to

Darby Tuesday night for their
they battle Augustana.

The Pioneers with their three
game winning streak broken by
St, Olaf will have to go all out
against the Rams to get back on
the winning track and remain
in the title chase. Prospects of

. bouncing back are good as the
cagers still remember that sting-
ing 75-53 defeat that the Rams
handed them earlier in the sea-
son. Height is of the utmost im«
portance as the tall Cornell
squad's biggest asset is control
of the boards. With this the tall
sophomores are slated for plenty
of action.

Possibly the Pioneers‘ only
advantage is catching Cornell in
their first game following semes—

suffered three conference losses
by a total of six points, will he

Eye loop Meet

Swim coach Irv Simone’s
small but powerful freshman
swimming squad accompanied
the varsity to Mt. Vernon this
noon to participate in a meet
with Cornell.

The dual aliair is to be a
warm-up tor the annual con-
ference telegraphic meet, sched-
uled for Feb. 21, which is ex.
pected to turn into a twoaway
tight for rirst between the Pio-
neers and Knox college.

What Simone terms "an ex-
ceptionally strong bunch of
freshmen,” the squad consists of
five boys L Dick Bresnahan,
Dean Crocker, Jim Jacobson,
Welt Jacobson, and Jim Palmer.

Bresnahan, one of the con-
ference's most promising young
swimmers, specializes in the
freestyle and breaststroke events,
Co-captain Dean Crocker, is
another breastroker, but can
swim almost any event.

The other eoecaptain, Jim
Jacobson, takes care of the
team’s distance work. Promising
Walt Jacobson has been doing
the team’s backstroking, while
Jim Palmer has established him-
self as a point-getter in the
breast stroke.

Grinheu basketball tans were
given an extra treat last week-

varsity swimming and wrestling
teams in the art of round‘oall.

In a ten-minute game pre-
ceding the Grinnell-Monmouth
contest last Friday night, the
shanpshootirig fresh swimming
team overcame a 5-4 half-team
lead by the freshman wrestlers,
and triumlped 9-5. Wrestler Lee
Miner was high scorer of ﬁne
game, tossing in rive points.

During half-time intermis-
sion of the Knotx-Grinnell
game on Saturday night the
varsity wrestling team trium-
phed over the swimming (ﬁlm
for the second straight year,
and proved that they are not

contest between Grinnell and
each of one other two sclmls.
Simone sees “good three-way
