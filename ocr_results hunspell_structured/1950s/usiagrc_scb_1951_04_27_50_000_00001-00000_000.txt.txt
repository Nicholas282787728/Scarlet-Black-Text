Council Announces

Social Hierarchy
For Nexl Year

The social hierarchy for 1951.
52 has been announced by Jim
Morgan, Student Council presir
dent.

Working with ave Baum-
gardner, Cowles junior, who will
serve as social coodinator will
be David Abbey, North campus
social chairman, Lord Lee Pugh
South campus social chairman,
and Beth Budd, intormal social
chairman.

Abbey, Cowles sophomore, will
replace Les Allen, Cowles sen-
ior; Lora Lee, Read sophomore,
will take ovci-
Mary Grimm, Loose hall iunior,
and Beth, Loose hall junior, will
replace Carolyn Macfarlanc,
Read senior,

A wide variety of parties for
both campuses is planned tor
next year by Abbey. His first
job will be to assist Allen with
the men’s spring housepartics.
He held a similar position in
high school in Evanston, 111,, and
has always been interested in
work of a social type. Abbey
stated, “There is nothing ro-
mantic, just plain administrative
work. But rll get to attend
three formals in one night.”

Lora Lee’s position is very
similar to Abbey’s, Hers is the
same supervisorrtype job and
she will also receive a $100 sal—
ary. She had experience as so
cial chairman of Mears last year
and was also active in social
planning in high school.

The main problem in Lora
Lee's planning is the probable
lack of men next year, She is
considering a revival of the
George and Martha Washington
ball and there is some thought
of a military bail. Most activi~
ties will be to encourage ball
spirit. Her first job will be with
commencement activities.

Beth's job, which will bring
her $125 a year, will deal with
affairs. She has had
experience with numerous com—
mittees while on the Grinneil
campus.
