WRIA.

by Ginny Haight

Intramural chainnen on South
campus are famous for their
constant use of this phrase,
“. a and we’d like to have as
many as possible come out for
the sport, even if it is only for
participationl"

Ping pong is the kind of
spurt in which everyone could
participate and the following

figures on participation in
each hall give an indication on
how the halls are responding
to the call. Main had 29% par.
ticipating, Cleveland 35%,
James 100%. Haines 71%,
Read 25%, and Loose 35%.
Congratulations to James.
Loose hall is assured of first
place in the basketball tourna-
ment now; and there is a three—
way tie for second place between
Read, Haines, and James which
will be played off next week.

 

Matman Andy Logothetis

by Pete Bradford

Grinnell wrestler Andy Lagos
thetis is recovering rapidly from
a chemistry lab accident which
cost the senior a chance to par-
ticipate in the Midwest confer»
ence wrestling meet here last
weekend.

Andy, a two—year letter win-
ner, is actually a newcomer to
the mat sport. He came to
years ago from

Thessalonikia.
Greece, where he captained the
soccer team and participated in
track. basketball and cross-
country.

Disappointed to find no soccer
at Grinnell, Andy decided to try
wrestling. Fortunately for Grin-
liell, too, for he finished third in
last year’s conference meet in
the 128-pound Class and held
down the number one spot on
the team at lilo-pounds this
year, until the accident that oc-
curred only a few days before
the conference meet.

Andy no doubt would have
won another letter next year but
he has fulfilled his graduation
requirements in three years in-
stead of four. A major in Chem-
istry, he plans to go to Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology
next fall on a teaching fellow-
shi. This summer Andy hopes
to v t his native Greece for the
first time since coming to Grin-
hell.

How did he happen to come to
Grinnell in the first place? A
member of nut eﬂlcient alumni
association was president of
Andy’s high school and interested
Andy in attending Grinnell.

When asked the old question

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his biggest sports' thrill, Andy
could not name any single inci-
dent but said. "There is a thrill
after any vlqtot‘y. which makes
you feel good for accomplishing
something Athletics also seem
to make you study harder since
you don’t have the time to fool
around."

The affable little Greek will be
missed around here next year
but is certain to be a real credit
to Grinnell \vhel'evel‘ he goes.

WELLHOUSE STUDIO

Across from the PM 0“!“

Next meet on the Pioneer
track squad’s schedule is the
Chicago invitational indoor track
meet W‘htcl’l begins tonight at the
University of chicago fleld‘house.

Centendin‘g for spots in the

distance legs are Dave Qutub,
Bill Largent, Jim Kingland,
Frank Hays, Larry Schaleger,
Gary Hayes, Ed Jantz. and
Denny Watson.

“the sprint crew includes Nick
Ryan, Scotty Walker, Charlie
Westriip, Hays, Kingland, and
Bob Elder.

Grinnell’s best chances are in

- the relays, especially the middle

distance races. Charlie Westrup,
stellar Pioneer timber-topper,
should give Bob Kirk of Carle-
ton and Dick Vogt of Monmouth,
top men in the conference and
deefnding champs in the low
ad highs respectively, and Frank
Looinis of the host team stiff
competition,

Joe Howard of Chicago is a
stand out in the shocput. He will
be hounded by Bill Baird of
Cornell.

Brad Ankerstar of Coe and
Ulysses Doss of Ripon are good
bets for title high jump Last
year they tied for first with
Baird of Cornell.

Paul Baptist appears to be all
alone in one two-mile. Loop
runners will probably concerts
trace on the relays.

'nhe canfel‘ences’ top broad
jumpers appear to be Bryan
vialette of Cornell and Dick Mll-
ler of Carleton.

Top team in the relays is ex-
pected to be Chicago with Grin-
nell, Cornell, and Carleton sec.
ond bets. Cornell, on the oasis of
their second place in the North
Central invitational relays last
week should be the Conferences’
best representative.

George Drake has been side-
lined for a while because of a
severe gash in his foot suffered
in practice last Wednesday
night and will not be available

for today’s meet.

Loomis is the man to beat in
the 60-yard dash again, although
he may be pressed by Wayne
Phillips of Coe, who has equaled
the meet record of 6.5 already
ohis season. other topsnotoh dash
men are Dick Miller of Carleton,

Cagers Split
Final Games

A complete reversal of form
at Ripon last Saturday night re-
sulted in a 33—75 loss for the
Pioneer basketball team. Grin-
nell had been red-hot in down.
ing Lawrence 78376 the night be-
fore at Appleton, wis. The split
in the final games of the season
robbed the Pfitschmen of a tie
for third in the conference and
sunk them to fifth.

in the l/awrence fracas Grin-
nell hit 17 out of their first 22
shots from the ﬂoor for an
amazing 77 3% clip. Dick von
Maui was particularly uncanny,
putting away seven of his first
eight attempts, Because of ac-
curacy from the field, the locals
ran up a 49.44 halftime lead and
hold on against the Vlke’s sec—
ond half challenge for a two.
point win.

Von M-aur paced the scoring
with .23 markers followed by
John Musser with 20. The Pla-
neer shooting percentage was a
torrid 50.9% for the game.

Against the Ripon Redmen
Grinnell’s shooting percent drop»
ped to 33.3% and that, coupled
\vioh a shabby defense, spelled
defeat. Trailing by four points
at the half, lthe home forces
pulled up to 60'58 but a final
Rian surge extending their
margin to 72.52 salted the game
away for the Redcmen.

Scoring was led -by Dick Crowl
who popcd in 23. John Musser
chipped in 21 and pulled 25 re
bounds oftf the boards. Ohuck
Peterson scored 20 to lead Ripon.
He was assisted by Don Toedt
with 19, Ed Lindrciih win 17 and
Ulysses Doss with 16.
