Planned for Swim Club Show

Dancing in the water will be
the feature of next week’s White
Caps' show. The annual swim
club presentation is built around
dances ranging from the state
1y minuet to a splashing square
dance.

500 tickets are available for
the showings at a p. m. Thurse
day and Friday nights. They
may be obtained from White
Caps members or at the door.
There is no cost, the production
being under the sponsorship of
W. R. A.

A duet to ”Jet," a new and
haunting record on the order of
“Spellbound,” promises to be
one of the highlights of the
show. The swimming by club
president Sally Rodgers and
Joan Berschied, Read junior, is
interpretative in nature and,
much like modern dance, veers
away from classic forms.

Synchronized swimming has
developed as a sport and artise
tic expression greatly in the last
five years. A guiding influence
has been the work of Mrs. The»
resa Anderson, a North high
school teacher in Des Moines,
who has been active in stan-
dardizing the technique used
and in publishing books of his
