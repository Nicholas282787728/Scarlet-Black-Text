Last November a poll of Midwest coutcrencc basketbal
coaclics tabbed Grinnell for last place, But the Pioneers upset the
dopesters and almost won the titlc Now the football coaches have
chosen Grinncll for the cellar spot, Why not? Grmnell has lost
nine straight grid clashes, and has only ll lettcnncn back.

Actually prospects are better than they appear on paper.
Six of those elevcn lcttermen will probably not have first string
assignments. Sophomores and newcomers have shoved them aside.
Grinnell's ncrial attack, practically nonvexlstent last year, should_
improve greatly this season under the combined leadership of
newcomer Vic Rampclberg and a more experienced Bob Norton.
Conch I'ﬂtsch is aiming for three wins, perhaps rour. His squad
is small, but potent; if injuries stay away, there'll be a few more .

Grlnnell by a three touchdown margin, bulling their way through
