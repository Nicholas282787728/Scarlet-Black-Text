Facul’ry Discusses Ways To

Revise Educaiicn Curriculum

By Sta“ Reporter

“The question of the future
of a field always comes up
when there is a major resignar
tiun," said President Howard R.
Bowen in an interview yester—
day. He went on to point out
that the resignation of Jay
Williams (education) has thus
occasioned a study of the
future of Grinnell‘s education
curriculum.

The iaculty Monday
cussed various ways to revise
the' curriculum ranging from
retaining the status quo to
eliminating those major con—
centrations leading to special
and elementary, certificates
The faculty unofficially ex-
pressed itself as being in
favor of improving the secon-
dary education curriculum but
opposed to changing or elim-
inating other areas.

According to the college by

laws: “Initiative in the creation
'or organization .of new depart.
ments or divisions, or the rears
‘ganization, Consolidation, divi5r
ion or abolition of departments
or’ divisions, shall be in the
hands of the president or may
be made by recommendations or

the faculty to the president.

“Proposed action thereon
shall be submitted to the lac-
pity for an expression of
op' ion, either by the faculty
.or through a committee de-
signed for this purpose by the
faculty Recommendations to
the Board of Trustees shall be
made by the president nwome

panieﬂ by a written record of
the opinion of the faculty or
faculty committee. Final

authority shall rest the

Board of Trustees”

Following a Wednesday meet-
ing of the Executive Council.
the following memorandum was
addressed to the faculty by
Bowen:

in

“The faculty has responded
promptly and picntifuiiy to
my request for advice regard-
ing teacher training, I inter.
pret the advice to be that no
change should be made at
present in our program for
the training of teachers, l
accept the advice and will
proceed accordingly. There
will be no need tor a special
faculty meeting next Monday.

“I plan to take steps immede
lately to find a replacement for
professor wiliiams,

“From the discussion of the
past few days, i conclude: (I)
that the entire faculty of
Grinneii college is vitally con—
cerned about the training of
teachers;. (2) that the faculty
hopes to remain in the busi-
ness of teacher training indef—
initely; and (Si that strengtlia
ening our program is a major
objective so far as our rec
sources will permit.

“On these three propositions
i am in full agreement 1 also
assume that our program in
teacher training should be unr
dcr continuous and serious
study just as all other parts of
our curriculum are subjected .to
continuous re-examination.",

Siudy Shows

Iniegrai’ed Dorms Successful

By Barb Burns and

Mary Lou [lostetter

Integration of freshman women into upperclass dormi-
tories was shown to be Working successfully in its first
year, according to our recently completed fourth hour
study. Cleveland and Read halls were integrated this year.

A third hall, James, is being integrated next year to
further expand the integration experiment.

The first phase of the study
was to have all women in fresh-
man and integrated halls list
their best friends. with this ma»
tcrial we made pictorial charts
of each of the halls, listing only
mutual choices, to determine
comparative interaction between
freshman and upperclasswomen
in the two types of halls house
ing freshmen.

There was a marked clusterr
ing of upperclasswomen living
in the freshman halls, while in
integrated dorms there was de-
cided interaction among women
from all the classes. In the in
tegrated halls there were no
groups of best friends composed
entirely of freshmen or of up-
perclasswomen.

House council positions in
halls for freshmen are held
solely by members of that class.
integrated halls' councils are
made up of nearly 50% fresh-
men. with the other offices be-
ing held by Women from the
other three classes. Freshmen in
intcgrated halls seemed to feel
that they had enough share in
hall aifai : only one girl in an
integrated hull stated that she
felt that upperclasswomen doin-
inoted hall affairs too much
and reported that she only felt
a little antagonism because at
that,

Remaining material was goth.
ored from questionnaires circus
latccl to all freshman women.
In answer to the query “Where
would you prefer to live next
year?" 56 chose integrated
dorms; 25 preferred upperclass
dorms and 36 had no preference.
All but thrcc of the freshmen
presently living in the integrat-
pd. halls did not select that type
of ball,

Responses were different
though to “with the experience
of this year, if you were com—
ing to Grinnell as a freshman
again, in which type of nail
would you choose to live?"
Freshman balls were named by
51 women, integrated by 47 and
it) said it made no difference.
Only two women now living in
integrated halls cited freshman
halls (there are 35 freshmen
in the two integrated halls).

More freshmen in integrated
halls had more upperclass close
friends: all integrated freshmen
had some upperclass friends.
More freshmen in Read and
Cleveland indicated that upper-
classwomen had influenced
their dating here.

Questioning about frequency
of dating proved to be interest—
ing. 33% of freshmen in both
frosh and integrated hails re—
ported that they had had an
average of 0,2 dates a month
during the entire year, but dur—
ing the second semester this
percentage rose in integrated
halls to 37% and in freshman
halls to 41%. There has been a
second semester increase for
both groups in the percentage
who date over 21 times a
month, in integrated hails it
rose from 4 to 7% and in fresh-
man hails ‘from i to 4%.

Fourteen women (six in inte-
grated halis and eight in fresh—
man dorms) stated that they
did not plan to return to Grin-,
nell next year Twelve of those
are planning to transfer to
another college next year. Cam<
pus social life was listed nine
times as the reason for leaving.
