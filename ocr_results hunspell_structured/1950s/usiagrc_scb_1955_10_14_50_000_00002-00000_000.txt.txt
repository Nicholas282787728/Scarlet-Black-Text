Same Old Story

October l2, 1935

Each spring is heard the chronic complaint that the Student
Council is useless. It never accomplishes anything and never
will. These misconceptions carry over the following year and
the cumulative effect of this kicking has been to create the prev-
alent opinion that the Student Council has not been, is not and
will not be anything.
’ A moment’s pause to survey the achievements of the cur-
rent Council will easily prove how wrong this assumption is. This
year's Council has succeeded in the accomplishment of three im~
portant things. First it placed the Scarlet and Black on the college
fees and in so doing reduced the price of a year’s subscription
from $1.50 to $50. Second, a complete reorganization of the semes-

ier feeallotments was made, last spring, and now the Council
is working out a new system for auditing student accounts.

Certainly these three achievements can not be scoffed at.
And it seems only fair to give credit where credit is due. The
present Council has been Working hard in an effort to really
be of some assistance to the Student body, and the least that,the
Students can do is cease to criticise until they have a legitimate
reason to do so. Give the Council members their just duel

SCARLET AND BLACK

The Sound

And

The Fury

by Art Travers
Last week an article appears

ing in this paper postulated that
prepping was an outgrowth of
a need on the part of upper-
classmen to have their ego in-
Hated. i would question this
statement, but my ego hasn’t
been on speaking tcrms with
my id for several years and you
can see what a mess I’m in

Rumors are ilying this week
about a new health center
which is supposedly to be con»
structed on the hockey field
across the street irom Loose
if such an idea is being con-,
sidered 1 believe that an or-
ganized advertising campaign
will have to be instituted, on
North Campus anyway.

After years of the old sys-
tem, student apathy has been
replaced by student animosity.
It's an all too frequent sight to
see a fellow, looking like death
warmed over, staggering around
the dorm because he refuses to
go to the infirmaryi

‘I have been there twice and
1 find it pleasant Oi coin-so,
this may be a. result of hav-
,ing gotten my requirements
out of the way (3-6 “Cold”,
and oz“: “Unknown Virus")
and am now ready for ad—
vancedcouisoe, notably in
“Morning After".

There are those who don't
like orange juice, and judging
by the amount served, the in-
firmary must buy the large
economy sized tank car of this
golden nectar. But orange
juice is good for you, so they
say. Believe me, if you’re sick
a week in the infirmary will
'make you feel like a million
dollars. (Although one look at
the piled up work and you’ll
feel like deflated currency.)

rWhen the s 8: B sent out
those sheets to poll the stu»
dents on what the extra dough
should go for, some suggested
doing something which would
improve the looks of the campus
forever. I wonder how much it
would cost to dynamite 'Blair
Halli

Those of you who were dis-
appointed because Mr. Goose-
law was not on “Heartbeat" last
week may take heart. The presi-
dent‘s reception made it impos-
sible for him to appear, but he
will be on this week with some
interesting things to say.
