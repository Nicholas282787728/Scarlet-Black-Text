Three Year Man Baker Looks
For Five Viciories This Year

by Jim O’Hnnlon

Two-year letter man George
Baker is a Pioneer tackle im-
the third straight season. George
played offense last year in the
dzlys of tlio twd-iplatoon system
and is a tcp»ilight blocker,

This year he was faced with
the problem of playing both
ways, which seems to be com-
mon to most tootballers. He
has come through in fine insh-
ion and turned into a good
defensi“: lineman.-

According to Coach Pfitseh,
George’s greatest virtue is his
great desire to play, and the fact
that he puts his all into every
game. This makes him the type
of player every coach likes to
have.

George's biggest enjoyment
is playing in a clean hardc
fought game. and playing ior

your body and coordination.

Senior Baker, who has played
in only one Grinncll victory be
fore this year, predicts that the
Knox victory is a sign of better
the run or the 5pm. 53 be. things to come. He foresees at
news that moths“ is 0; gm; least five victories for the Grins
value as it helps to build up inel-hans ﬂhis Season.
