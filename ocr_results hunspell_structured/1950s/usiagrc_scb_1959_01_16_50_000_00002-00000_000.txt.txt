l was privileged to tour the
new library the other day, and
l highly recommend the expe-
rience to those who douht that
it is going to be a boon to Grin-
nellr I confess that I have had
doubts about it: the shelves on
east and west are not impres-
sive, and the total outward et—
iect—that of a squashed box—is
not one to make your heart beat
raster.

But once inside, it is impoSe
sible to remain unmoved. The
vast sheets of glass and the
concrete cor-ms, combined in
the promenades at either end,
are quite exciting. The build-
ing, made almost comsortable
by plastic sheeting and half
a dozen squat, roaring stoves,
hllnls and rings with activity;
one is struck by the size of
the under-inking, and the in-
ﬁnite variety of tasks involved.

If you have heretofore reviled
the thing (as l have), don’t tail
to go through it before year's
end. The workmen, incidentally,
are quite hospitable.

l returned from the library
with a sense that Grinnell was,
perhaps, Going Somewhere . i .
but this feeling evaporated as I
walked into Rawson. Progress
had struck: there, next to the
water fountain, sat a monstrous
Coke machine. replete with
lights, coin returner and paper
cups I understand that other
halls have been similarly blessed
with this wonder of the age,

I hate to seem eternally iin-
grateful toward the Powers“.
but couldn‘t we move that
scarlet beast outside some-
where? None of Ils is too lazy
to brave thirty seconds of cold,
and I truly believe that it
Spoils whatever semblance of
decor we had previously.

s . s

With these rather Lin-earth-
shaking comments l bring things
to a close. I extend my most
sincere thanks to Sue O’Brien
and to the college itself for
hearing with me so cheerfully
during my stay. 1 tender my
position to John Stocking with
hopes that he will enjoy it as
much as I have But enough:
this is

The End.

Navel-Contemplation?

Last week‘s S&B carried a summarizzltion of a faculty
committee’s recommendations regarding possible changes
in the Grinnell curriculum. An editorial studied various
facets of the plant Somehow, in the student hysteria over
the Kingston Trio, the more important issue of these rec-
ommendations has been forgotten This we feel to be a
sad commentary on the interests and maturity of the
Grinnell student. We expected at least one letter to_ the
editor concerning this report. Members of the committee
have listened anxiously for student reactions to their pro-
posals. All they hear is silence.

Whether or not the outcome of this consideration will
directly effect the student on today’s campus it marks a
significant step not only in Grinllell education built in
higher education itselfr Far more worthy of thought and
discussion than the relative merits of Brubeck, the Hi—Los
and the now infamous Trio, the report is being sadly
slighted.

We urge, and the faculty will welcome, student study
and consideration of the proposals. To be sure, a Student
Council committee will study the topic, but hasn’t the stu-
dent body yet learned from experience that it too often has
left things ill council’s hands until it is too late? This is not
an indictment of council but of a student body uninterested
in its own government until driven by the mob instinct.

The Committee on Student Publications has recom
mended that Student Council grant salaries to the men wh
run KGRWr Our only objection to this action is that th
recommended salaries are too small. Unfortunately their
will be more basic opposition to the committee’s proposal.

KGRW represents perhaps the largest investment cl
student capital on Grinnell campus. Many of the allcca
ticns have met with direct opposition, either to the expendi
’ture or to \the station itself

But now, after one and a half years of work by th-

present station heads, the entire campus finally hears th
”Voice of Grinnell College.”

Messrs Fitz and Scott have received at least toke
rcnumeratlon for their work. We aren’t worried about them
But we are concerned about the future of the station.

Devotion is one thing, it has inspired some math
admirable acts. But lt can only go so far. The same peopl
who_ have the intelligence and practicality to run a radi-
statlon have the intelligence and practicality to see the
cannot afford, as students, to put up to forty hours a wee
into an unrewal'ding occupation.

The investment represented in the station must b-
guarded. The college spends money on maintenance, as do

businesses. Is it not a sound protection of the student in
Iterest 111 the station to in '

in those who administer it? This would seem like good busi

ness. It would also seem like fairness to those who put tim-
and effort into bringing KG into the dorms.

The Scarlet and Black last
Week published a student let-

ter which criticized Mrsr June
Main, executive housekeeper,
for condscating “personal
property." The letter closed
with “The Commandment
reads ‘thou shalt not steal.’ "

We regret the printing at
this letter and its aspeisions
upon the honesty of Mrs.
Main. In our opinion, it was
the housekeepers right to re
move property tram public
rooms, as was the case, and
to keep it until reclamation
by the owner. We apologize
for our negligence in printing
the defamatory rind mislead—
ing letter and state our belief
in Mrs. Mail-J’s honesty.

s: x: e
To the Editor:

I don’t doubt tor a moment
that Mrs Main is honest and,
concerning the letter of last
week, I of course regret that
there was a challenge‘to her
integrity.
