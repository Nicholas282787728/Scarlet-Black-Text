Fray Feat ares
James, Loose

During Monday night's house-
meeti-ng the Ladies of Loose
hall challenged the Juliets of
James to a footiball contest
which is to be held on ’McEziChe
ron field tomorrow afternoon at
3:30 p. m. The James girls re—
sponded with a unanimous vote
of acceptance, and busy pre-
parations are now going on in
‘both dwellings.

James has announced that
their team, the Juliets, will
wear black Jackets, and will be
coached by Judy Churchill and
Nancy Robson. The Loose Lad-
ies will wear red, and their
coach will be Joe Kogen of
Smith hall, who .was recently
named “Coach of the Year”.

Coe, Knox, Cornell
Lose To Harriers

Grinnell's once-defeated har~
riers finished their dual meet
season with three victories this
past week. Knox and Cornell
fell last Saturday in a triangu-
lar before the Pioneer Home
coming crowd, and Coe became
Grinnell's seventh victim of the
season last Tuesday.

Coach E. G. Booth’s charges
swept the first three places
against Knox and Cornell to
score 21 points to Cornell's 47
and Knox's so in the three—mile
triangular. Scoring on a dual
basis gave Qrinnell 19-42 and
17.46 wins; Cornell took the
Siwash 22-39.

Drake Breaks Tape

George Drake gained first in
16 minutes so seconds. Captain
Bob Downs and Larry Schale-
ger tied for second. Jim Spence
of Knox was fourth, followed
by Cornell’s Don Stubbs.

John Walden was Grinnell’s
fourth finisher in sixth place,
Cary Wulf and Chuck Price
took the next two places for
Cornell, while Den Ver Ploeg
completed pioneer scoring with
ninth place.

herent responsibility.

1 am firmly convtnced that
Hastings has failed to make
MAVERICK a literary magazine.
As a workshop it is laudable.
Those students who have the
urge to write and are not fond
of rejection slips should use it
as such. But the MAVERICK as
a literary magazine should cease
to exist. it should not be the are
ficial literary organ for the Cole
lege; it will only continue to
discredit it, it should not be
offered for sale: it will only
disappoint its subscribers again.
A literary magazine and a lit-
erary workshop are not Synon-
ymous and Hastings does not
seem to realize it. Literature of
value seeks its own level, and
MAVERICK, ‘Wlth its present
editorial policy, will never en—‘
able those students who respect
their artistic integrity to have
a literary voice on this campus.

I, at least, prefer to stay at
home and stack my rejection
slips than go out in bad com-
pany.

Henrerork Steiner

While the two Midwest con—
ference leaders, Coe and St.
Olaf, sit out open dates this
week in preparation for their
show—down meeting on Nov.
12, the battle for third place
will hold the spotlight.

Carleton, currently in third
place with a 4—2 record, winds
up its season by playing host
to fifth place Ripon (2—3). A
win for the Carls would clinch
third for last year’s champs.

Vikea Top Caries

Carleton, hard hit by the loss
for the season of quarterback
Bub Scott, fell to Lawrence 60
in the rain on Saturday. The
game does not count in the
standings, but it was a bitter
pill for the ex-champs to swal-
low.

Ripon had an open date last
Saturday following its scoreless
tic with Lawrence. The Redmen,
like the Carts. have been hard
hit by iniuries. Don St. Arnnuld,
ther best linebacker, broke his
leg in the Lawrence game.

Grinnell vs. Knox

This was the second serious
injury for the Redmen. In the
season's opener star halfback
John McMahon received a
kidney injury that kept him in
the hospital for several weeks.

Grinnell will travel to Knox
for the only other game that
will affect the standings. A win

Froshballers Trip
Cornell, Gain Even
Split For Season

Scoring in the last quarter,
Grinnell’s freshman gridders
edged Cornell 20-13 In the frosh
Homecoming contest
urday morning. The win gave
Grinnell a .500 mark in its t/wo
games.

The margin of victory came
on a bootleg pass play from
Jim Burkett to end Paul phil-
lip; the extra point was added
on George Butfalo's aerial to
Bob Clem.

Cornell drew first blood, tak-
ing the opening kickoff and
marching 50 yards to paydirt.
The conversion attempt was no
good.

The Junior Pioneers tallied
late in the second period on a
sustained drive of no yards.
Jack Micheletto went the final
13 yards for the score, Steve
Eauserman added the point
after touchdown to give Grin-
nell a 7-6 halftime margin,

In the third period, after a
short Cornell punt, Larry Dukes
set up the Pioneer's second
score with a 32-yard sprint and
tallied four plays later.

Cornell retaliated with tan
80ey'drcl drive, then kicked the
extra point to tie the score at
13.13, to set the stage for the
Pioneers late heroics.

Cited by coach John Pfitsch
for their play were Gary Nolder,
Bruce Wilkerson, Burdettc Abel,
Jim inannenstiel, and John
Thomann, in addition to those
mentioned above

hold on sixth place. Crinneil fell
to Cornell by a 13-7 score this
past Saturday, while Knox was
becoming Coe's sixth conference
victim by a 3376 count.
Game Is Tossdlp
This game looks like a toss
up. Both teams have shown
flashes of top-grade football
but have been able to_ pick up
only one conference wiri apiece.
Knox beat Monmouth zoo
and Grinnell beat Ripon 3M.
Grinnell also trounced Law-
rence 45-13 in a game which did
not count in the standings.
The final game on this week’s
schedule pits Cornell against
Lawrence. Cornell is favored
although Lawrence has gained
strength each week since the
beginning of its abbreviated
season, The game will not count
in the standings.
