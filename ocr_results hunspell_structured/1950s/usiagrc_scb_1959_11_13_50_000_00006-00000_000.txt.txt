Animal
life .

by Jerry Gray 1

With the beginning of winter
in Grinnell comes a temporary
lull in the IM sports world.
During this period, the volley-
ball season is just getting on
its feet and the swimmers are
lackadaisically preparing for
the swim meet one week away.
Consequently, yours truly had
some extra time to sit and pon-

der over Grinnell [M’s and var—
ious other problems of world-
shaking importance.

One point which immediately
comes to my mind is a fact that
many Grinnelllans have come
to accept without a second
thought. This fact is concerned
with the relative strength and
popularity of the Grinnell lM
program when compared with
those programs which exist in
other similar institutions; One
would have to look a long time
to find an intramural athletic
program which included full
seasons in football, volleyball,
basketball and softball along
with tournaments in tennis,
golf, swimming, bowling and
track.

To use one example, many
of the Midwest conference
schools restrict the majority of
their intramural athletics to
double elimination tournaments
and the like.

There are a number of peo-
ple at Grinnell who have had
a hand. in maintaining our lM's.
,The entire coaching staff comes
under this heading; however,
the one man who is lnost re-
sponsible is our faculty intra-
mural adviser and chairman.
Mr. John C, Truesdale, Only
those individuals who have sat
on the Hill board have had the
opportunity to fully realize the
benefits which we have derived
from Mr. Truesdale's never-end-
ing labors.

He is our sole representative
in dealings with the varsity
coaches on the problems of fa-
cilities, equipment, and various
other matters. The amazing
amount of athletic rules and
general knowledge Mr. Trues-
dale has accumulated through
the years as a varsity coach and
Director of Intercollegiate Ath-
letics has provided us with a
“walking rulebook” and arbitra-
for.

In addition to these and many
other forms of assistance we
have received from Mr. Trues-
dale, he has become a long
lasting personal friend of every
student who has been privileged
to work with him. In behalf of
all the Grinnell 1M “animals,"

past, present, and future, 1
would like to extend our sin.
cere thanks to Mr. Truesdale

for all the work he has done
for us and express the hope that
perhaps some one of us can
sometime provide the same
type of leadership for other
young men and women.

Alden said, in reference to
ithese two decreases, ”The de—
crease in overnight use of re-

for _ . , by the fact that the
library is open an additional

300 Peiiiion:
‘Hire Van Doren'

Over sou students signed pe.
titions last week directing the
trustees to “make any and all
efforts to effect the employment
of Charles Van Dcrenasamem-
ber of the faculty." petitions
did not reach all students in
this limited time.

The petition read as follows:
“We, the undersigned, do
petition the trustees of Grin-
nell college, a Christian and
liberal institution, to make
any and all efforts to effect
tire employment of Charles
Van Doren as a member of
the faculty.

“We believe this man to be
of high intellect, a competent
teacher, and further contend
that he has made a minnlcte
confession of his human frail-
ties and therefore is again
qualified to take his place as
an educator of American
Youth.”

The Columbia university trus-
tees accepted Van Doren‘s res-
ignation from its faculty last
week.
