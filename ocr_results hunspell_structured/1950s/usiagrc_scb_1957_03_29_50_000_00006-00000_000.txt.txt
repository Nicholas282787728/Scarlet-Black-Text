Considered By SC;
Decision Deferred

An apparently attractive
offer from Pepsi»Cola com-
pany combined with elections
and appointments of officers
to highlight this week‘s reg-
ular Strident Council meet-
ing.

The soft drink company ex-
pressed a desire to place two
trial machines on campus, and
for this privilege offered, in ad-
dition to regular profits accru-,

ing to the council, a $1000 schol~
arship for a Grinnell student.

Because the council's exact
contractual arrangements with
Coca—Cola are not now known,
action was deferred on the new
proposal pending determination
ot‘ the present setup.

The council elected Jerry
Thompson its new treasurer. Ap-
pointed as north campus co~or~
dinator was Gordie Hunt, res
placing the retiring John
stroupe Jack Hanna was select»
ed to fill Dave Hubbard's post
as buildings and grounds reprer
scntative. The Student Affairs

adopted a resolution recom-
mending that the library be

ing body within the hall.

In regard to League Board
elections. one committee re—
norted that integrated halls
would tend to establish a trend
to elect the hall president
from Within each dorm. The
juniors and seniors favored
only two candidates for League

liked the present system of
