Ellen Pettersilie has received
word that her short story, “Ssh

short story contest. The story
concerns people who spend
their Saturday afternoons
studying the various art forms
at Carnegie hall. More particu-
larly, it is about a young girl
who finds herself in a very
ditierent world there than at
her home at the other end of
