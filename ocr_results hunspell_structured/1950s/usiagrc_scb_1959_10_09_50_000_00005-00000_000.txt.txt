Coe’s football team held com-
ete mastery over Grinnell for
e ﬁrst half last Saturday, only

return after the intermission
o ﬁnd itself on the defensive
.r the ﬁnal so minutes. Coe
evertheless defeated the Pica
eers, 1645, in a contest mark-
d by nine fumbles.

Coe moved the ball nearly
at will for the first two quar-
ters, scoring once in each pe-
riod, and held a 1641 halftime
lead due to the running of
hob Topping and Justin Wat—
son and the passing of Keith
Rasher. '

The start of the second half,

lowever, marked the end of
06's offensive dominance as
e Kohawks never moved the
all into Pinoeer territory dur—
g the remainder of the game.
rinnell tallied in the third pe-
icd and twice drove deep into
so territory in the ﬁnal quar—
er, only to fall short of the
oal both times.

The first score of the game cc»

~urred with three minutes rc-
aining in the first period as
atson drove four yards thru
he middle of Grinnell’s line,
:ulminating a 58-yard Kohawk
lfensive. Rusher carried the
all into the end zone for the
wospaint Conversion.

 

Coe scared its ﬁnal touch-
iiown with six minutes re-
maining in the ﬁrst half. Aﬂ-
er recovering a Pioneer film-
ble, ,t'he Kohawks marched
49 yards to score. Instrumen-
tall in this drive was a. 19-yard
pass play from Rusher to end

Grinnell launched its first real
flensive of the game early in
he third quarter. The Pioneers
enetrated to the Gas eighte
ard line, but ran out of downs
t that point. Coe then found
tsclf unable to move the ball
oinst a stout Grinnell defense
, d was forced into a punting
ituation only to fumble the
.all to Grinnell on the Coe 23.‘
ard line. .

The Pioneers covered this
distance in six plays, with
halfback John mrtung driv-
ing the final yard for the
touchdown. A pass by Bob 1
Wcito to end Jim SimmonSl
was good for the two—pointl
conversion. This ended the
scoring for the afternoon

Grinnell recovered two Coe
umbies and intcrceptcd a pass
n the final minutes, but was
noble to push the ball over
or another touchdown. l

individual stars for Grinnell

were Hartung, who carried
ball 16 times and netted a total

of so yards rushing, and Woito,
who completed seven passes'for
a total of so yards during the
contest.

Sophomore linebacker Dick
Harris was the mainstay of
Grinnell’s defensive unit,

only to the unbeaten and un-l
scored-upon gridiron forces of
Cornell college.

The earls boast an offense i
that grinds out consistent
yardage on the ground and
through the air, but their real
pride is in their rock—ribbed
defensive unit. other teams
have been able to manage only
36 points against a defense led
by a 5‘ a" 197-112. guard whom
Coach Bob Peterson culls “pro-
bably the best player in the 1
Midwest Conference." George
Williams is the man’s name,

and if his advance rating is ,

any indication, he will be
worth watching tomorrow. Co-
captain and linebacker John
Larson is anothcr highly—touted
defensive performer.

For Grinnell, the picture is
not good, but there are a few
bright spots. Terry Moore. Roger
Smith, John Hentzel and Ron
Sandler are all injured and un-
likely to see action. Ray Rogers

every Grinnell touchdown this
season.

0n the brighter sideof the
ledger, the team apparently has
not adopted a defeatist attitude
but is once again “up" and
hungry for a victory. Peterson
expressed satisfaction at the
work of sophomore Ron esch—
ner against ‘rlle Kohawks and
plans to start him at one of
the halfback posts tomorrow. ,
A constant source of pleasure
to the coaching staff is the
defensive work of another-

was credited with 21 mckles

record.

Carl's Harriers
To Race Here

The Pioneers will meet
Carleton’s cross country team
tomorrow afternoon at 1:25,
starting the race from Ward
field.

Last year Grinnell trounced
Carleton by a perfect score of
15-43. But the Carls’ three top

runners did not participate due
to injury and sickness. So far
this year, Carleton is undefeat—
cd. Having taken second through
fifth places against top-ranking
Cornell, Carleton promises to be
Grinnell‘s toughest adversary.

Senior captain Ted Wahlfeld
will lead six returning letter-
men against Grinnell tomor-
row. Three are seniors—Bob
Bennett, Bob Stemsrud and
John Wilson. Juniors nob snot-
wcll and itich Wilson will be
runn'ng in the fifth and sixth
pos ons, and sophomore
Chuck Jennings will be Carle-
mn’s seventh man; last year,
Jennings placed third in the
Midwest Conference freshman
telegraphic meet.

Coach Richard Young said
that all the conference coaches
pick Carleton as the best team
in the league. The reasons for
his are Carleton’s record this
year and its overall experience.

Last Saturday. the Grinnell
harriers chalked up another
victory by defeating Ripon 18-
43, just three points over a per-
fect score.

Grinnellian Keith Kcster
captured first place over a 3.3-
mile course in 17:414., with
Art Kisser and Go} Thomson
following. Fourth—place Bill
Ticky was moon's first mm
across the finish line. Paul
Kisser took fifth. followed by
Ripon’s John Diedrich. ‘

Bill Patton, in seventh place,
was fifth man across for the
Pioneers. Hap Lutter finished in
eighth place, and Dick Fisher,
running unattached, copped

,ninth. Ron Dorr came across in
‘tenth

as Grinnell’s number

seven man.
