aren’t expected to provide
much competition for coach

On the third of February the
swimming team will return home
to face the Cornell college Rams.

WresHers Tackle
War+burg, Suffer

Gl‘lnnell’s varsity grapplcrs
hope to get back in winning
ways against Wartburg college

tomorrow at Waverly aiter los.t

ing three lopsided matches to
Cornell, lowa State and the Uni-
versity of Nebraska

Mat roach Bob Peters‘on ex-
pected that tomorrow’s clash
would be “more evenly matched”
against a Wartburg crew which
has lost one meet to Mankato
state Teachers

Next Priday'.’ Griniiell will
race Coe in the first meeting
between the two teams. This
is Cue’s first year of inter
collegiate wrestling.

Thus far this season Coe has
registered victories over Luther
and Dubuque, while‘v losing to
powerful Cornell, 26-18. This
match wasn't as close as the
score indicates, as each of the
Cornell wrestlers was moved up
a weight class, giving his oppon-
ent at least a ten pound weight
advantage,

The Coe match will be the last
collegiate match for Phil Hart-
sock, since the stocky senior
graduates at the end of this
semester.

Last Friday the Grinnel]
wrestlers were defeated by No.
braska, 274;, olimaxing a long

eeh of matches in which

rinnell was deﬁnitely out-
classed,

Highlight of the match from
the Grinnell standpoint was in
the 137 pound class, where Carl
Couve decisioned Nebraska’s Jack
Tirousek, 10 togi. Couve was
the master throughout the match,
scoring on near pins in each of-
the‘ three periods to gain Grins
nell’s only points of the meet.

The Cornhuskers won seven of
the eight matches, three ofthem
by falls. One of the pins was
by Nebraska’s all—American foot-
ball player, Ed Housman, over
Phil hartsock in the heavy-
weight division. .

It was the fourth triumph
in a row for the second-place
Pioneers, whose season record
is now six wins and three

early in the first quarter when
Grinnell trailed, 84. But with
the Pioneers ahead by 14 points
late in the final period, 79-65,’
the Oles made a desperate spurt
and managed to close the gap to

disappointed that “we didn't
play very well” but asserted
that “the boys handled HIE
press better” and are “build-
ing up confidence."

Grinne“ led at each quarter”

with scores of 22-13, 44-33, 57,
52, and 81-74.

the hoop, against the Pioneers
34.2 per cent.

was at the free throw lane
where it sank 29 of ll at~
tempts, while st. Olaf could 1
score on only 22 out of 43,

Jim Variand tallied 21 points
for the losers and John Gustaf
son had 18, while Tom Railsback
and Dick von Moor of Grinneli

his analysis is Bill Adix, slen-
