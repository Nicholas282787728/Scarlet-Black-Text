Harrison Calls “Caesar" Interesting,
Occasionally Arduous, Above Average

by A] Harrison

The Grinnell Players, Kim
Chase, and a young east have
brought an interesting pro-
duction of “Julius Caesar"
to the Arena Theatre this
week; one which is some
times brilliant and occasion-
ally arduous, but on the
whole far above the average
of Grinllell theater.

Out of the cast of twenty (of
which elcven are freshmen), two
men are outstanding. Dave
Steiner, as Cassius, achieves al‘
most complete control of his
character, and apart irorn some
unevenness. givs a powerful
performance, perhaps the most
polished male performance of
the year. Pete Way’s job with
the role of Brutus is exception-
al because of the fact that this
fine work is his first stage role
or any consequence. At times
he shows amazing sensi vity.

. The cast as a whole is un-
even. and necessarily so, be-
cause or the amount of toll.
ent from which Chase could
draw. Apart from the two
mentioned above, the most
noteworthy jabs are done by

Jim Stewart, and several with
smaller parts in scenes which
are excellent. Stewart's An-
thony is best described as im—
pressive. as sometimes falls
out or a true character por-
trayal and into the realm or
an excellent dramatic rcnding.
However, his rolc is probably
the most even of the princi-
pals. The outstanding hits
spoken or are Jerry Tomlin-
snn’s Casoa, Fritz Hamilton's
Cinnn poet and Titinius, Mar-

tha Kelly’s Lucius, Julie Stew-

art’s Portia, and the Artirnc.
dorns and strata of Jun

Stacey. Ron Henry. Lynn Par-

sons, and .lndic ltcgct give
rairly capable interpretations

of Caesar, Octavius. and Ca!-
purnia.

Chase appears to have been
greatly worried about the play
lbecaming static in the Arena
For this reason the direction
stands out to a distracting der
grec at times, particularly the
scenes between Brutus and aCs-
sius, in which the movement
takes on the characteristics of a
tennis match. Cline makes per-
'haps‘ too much use oi various
devices, such as the pregnant
pause; and technically, tricks
with lights. In most cases the
lighting is emotive, but. as an
instance, the Mephistophilean
character of Anthony’s oration
is somehow jarring.

The greatest meliment to
be paid to lure direction, hpart
from the development of Way
and Steiner, is in the preciso

and unobtrusive tuning of sev—
eral :0f the scenccs, particu-
larly .those which involve the
conspirators, and 'in the how
oi lthe play as n lwhole. Still,
the production I‘ls spottyr .Those
scenes lwhich involve physical
action hm! large groups iof
people are brilliantly done,
Those in which the impact
comes from .the nanguage and
from conﬂict of personalities
and trnotivu are sometimes
milked dry.

”Caesar” marks another step
in the growth of Gi-innell
ohcater, which has Come a long
way this year, because of Chase:
development of freshman talent
and interest in the players or-
organizetion. Besides the devel-
opment of freshmen in the cast,
underclassmen were largely re-
sponsible for technical work on
the show; and a large group 'of
freshmen worked many hours
under Mrs Norman Marble and
Sally Osborne on costumes.

The play, sold out each night
this week and Tuesday of next
week, will run an additional
performance Wednesday night if
forty tickets are sold. Up to
now, twentyrone have been sold.

The Sound
and
The Fury

by Art Travers .

Lately, it seems, there’s sonic-
thing a’bout my room that lives.
In fact, it moves. (Tlhis move
ment is not to be confused with
the movement displayed lby the
' sins in the Foods Department’s
1' sin pudding.) Our furry little
friend: are Wllh us once more.

Several weeks ago—around
(three in the mm‘ning (I keep,
rather unusual hours since I
like to be alwake when the heat‘
is on.) I heard a noise in Jim
Gabi‘ielson’s room. I hurried In
and found the Gabe nattily atr
tired in his paiainas and bare
leet, hurling cats at the waste
‘basket, There VV'EIS a glazed look
in his Eye and he held a Nazi
bayonet in his hand.

“Theny's a mouse in that
waste lbasket. lNasty mean old
thing lwoke line up." (anc's,
language [S considerably lex-
purgated for the beneﬁt of
prospccitve students.)

1 was clevestatingly witty,
”Oh,” I said.

“I’m gonna get him. His
scurrying days lare over.”

We caught hirn after we had
completely disarranged the
room. (The mouse escaped from
the waste basket.) That after-
noon he was consigned to a
watery grave in the washroom.

But “he nutter-patter M little
feel: still lpersistcd. lcheese and
Soda crackers disappeared. The
Gabe Miscovcrcd that someone
had Fbcen {nibbling ion his suit—
case. Fruit ‘ vanished. This
meant war.

We lbDug’ht the latest rat
poison and put it around in
prominent places. it was gone in
24 hours. There was not one
single corpse to be found. Alp-
parently they liked it.

Hand—topaw combat resulted
in eight more fatalities among
the mice. Then they left.

Now they're back. It‘s be-
ginning to bother me. 1 much
preferred the cockroaches I
had last year. ’1‘th minded
their own business. But these
mice are downright boisterous.
Don’t they know about quiet
hours and other various and
sundry college regulations? And
Ihave la persistent fear that
they are having lewd relations
in my walls. Any and all pied
pipers may apply to me.

To the Editor:

it has commonly been the 111157
fortune of the contributors to
this space that they open themr
selves to direct attack by making
proposals, which, if carried out,
would be beneficial to them-
selves, possibly at the eiopense
cl an "oppressed ininoiity". Cons
sequelltly, it gratifies this writer
that ho is able to register a
gripe against an action which in
no way presently aliccts himr
self, and which, if reversed
(1.000 to i it won't he) would
hurt absolutely no one.

Now, unless my memory
has (failed inc completely, it
seems that i saw, in last
week’s edition of tll's paper,
an administration pronunce-
merit lim ing membership on
the Dean’s [List to lonly ithc
upper 10% M the student body.
One worthy reason has been ut—
tered for departure from this
decision: l-going to two decimal
places lunder la letter-grading
system would ’be a little ab-
surd". This can hold lgrave
implicationsl

From some quarters might
even come the suspicion that
someone is incapable of carrying
out a division problem to the
soon id decimal place. what else
could be the reason?? 0n the
other hand, 1 know several peo-
ple with 3.55, 3.57, and 3.59

bit absurd to extend the “arith-
metick'mg”. Also, we have the

lmiprove the collegiate papers
and hear mem’bers of the work-
ing lpress from Chicago, St.
Louis, and Decatur give their
views.

Nancy, commenting on her
trip to the conference, said, “I
hope to be able to gather ideas
for making the 5ch a better
paper.”

in Nancy’s absence, Ernest
Ger-shop, special assistant editor.
will act as editor of this issue

tine old paradox of several mem-
bers of Hormits, duly cited for
“outstanding scholarship in the
freshman year", finding theme
Selves still on the familiar cut
system.

So, as little hope as there is
that any action will be taken
upon the subject, at least some
ink has been spilled in the best
interests. And. congratulations
for the editorial oi last week.

sincerely,
Tom Skornia
