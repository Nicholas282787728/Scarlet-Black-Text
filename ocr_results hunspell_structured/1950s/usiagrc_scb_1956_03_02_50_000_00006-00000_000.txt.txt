details of the convention.)

deal of confusion seems to have arisen

especially in the

minds of freshmen and sophomores who have never seen

one of these unique political

The convention will run some
thing like this: student Coun»
cil President Ken Kassebaum
will open the convention by
reading the rules in detail. Then
a roll call of all hall delega-
tions will be called alphabeti-
cally, to determine that the core
rect number of certiﬁed dele-
gates are present.

Second Roll Call

Next comes the second roll
call. Once again the halls will
be called in alphabetical order,
and each hall will have an op-
portunity to nominate candi—
dates.

The tour candidates who
submitted petitions before the
convention will be nominated
as well as any “draft" can-
didates, the diiierence being
that the ‘ﬁraft” candidates
must be approved by 20% of
the delegates and rnnst have
submitted their consent to be
nominated. (As we go to press,
the Election Board is con-
sidering plans to limit the
number oi “draft" nomina-
tions.)

A11 nominations must be com-
pleted on this roll call, after
which the balloting begins. Af-
ter the instructed (first) ballot,
the delegates are free to vote
for any candidate they please.

Pass, Yield Rules

Two particular rules of the
convention Caused confusion in
the minds of several delegates
and delegate chairmen, the
“pass” and “yield” rules.

The "pass" rule simply states
that any hall not wishing to
vote in alphabetical order may
pass to the end. This may be
done only once on each ballot.

The "yield" rule is more
complicated, and can best be

explained by example. Let us .

assume that Hall A is first.
Hall A may agree to “yield"
to Hall 2 on the nominating
ballot, in which case Ball Z
would nominate til-st, then
Hall A, then B, and so iorth.
Hall z would then be skipped
when its regular turn came.

. A hall may pass, yield or nom—
inate on the nominating roll
call. Halls nominating a candi—
date may not then yield,

Recognition

has also caused contusion, larger

how become mixed up with
yielding. When a hall ismamed
on the nominating roll call, the
delegate chairman may recog-

person not a delegate whom he
wishes. when that person has
linished, the delegate chairman
may recognize another speaker,
and so on, depending on limits
fixed by the Election Board.

Here‘s the sort oi thing
which you‘can expect to see
tomorrow: 0n the nominating
roll call, Hall A may pass,
Hall is may yield to Hall c,
which in turn may yield to
Hall 1).

Hall D may recognize a speak-
er from its delegation, other
delegations, or from me zludi-
ence. When the speaker finishes,
