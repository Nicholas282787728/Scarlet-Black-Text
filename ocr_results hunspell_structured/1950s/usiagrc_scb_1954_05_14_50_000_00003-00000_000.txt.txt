“Legion” Based On Facts

by David Steiner

“‘My Name Is Legion” is not a play in the real sense of the
word”, said Sally Osborne, student director of the productian_to
be played on the ARI-l stage tonight and tomorrow- “Actually, it’s

more like an illustrated lecture.

Ozzie Went on to say that ‘

My Name is Legion" was taken

from the book “A Mind That Found itself" by Clifford Beers. The
book is an autobiography, and tells of conditions in mental hose
pitals in the period around 1900. Mr. Beers was himself in a
mental institution, and when released he wrote his book to en-

lighten the public.
Now, Nora Stirling and Nina
hidenour have made the book
into a play starring John
Springer, senior, as the nan-av
tor; Alan Harrison, junior, as
the Internal Voice, with Steve
Michealidcs. sophomore, Hank
ltodkin, sophomore, Chuck
Heines, sophomore, Ron Henry,
freshman, and Jim Amelirg,
junior, in supporting roles.

The audience should be pre-
pared for an extremely un-
usual show. There is an al-
most complete lack of props,
and the central character is
represented by an empty chair.
The set is all in black and pre—

sents a very somber atxnos-
phere. It is a very serious
Show; the audience should be

prepared to do some thinking
as it is not done strictly for e
tertainment.
starts at 3:30

The play is in one act, and
begins at 8:30 instead of the
usual 8 pm. curtain time.

“My Name Is Legion" is be.
ing spomored at Grinneu by
The National Association For
Mental Health Incorporated, but
Sally says it's just coincidence
that this happens to be Mental
Health Week.

R Perry and J. Floss have
combined efforts again, and this
time instead of a “Blueboy” lihey

present Wednesday, May 19 at
8:00 in ARI-l.

“A Case Of Mistaken identity"
concerns a lonely widow (Karen
Kalirn), whose daughter has been
traveling in Europe for two
years, and her gossipy friend
Mrs. Strug. The two girls really
don’t like each other, but they’re
neighbors and don’t have any-

one else to talk with, conse-
quently they’re friends.
The play opens with Mrs.

Strug coming in with a letter
from Adelaide. the daughter.
The letter discloses that Ade-
ladie's fiance will precede her
to America.

A .man (Bill Rex) is mis»
taken for the fiance and from
that point the story unfolds rap-
idly.

consider Tv Show

l Mr. Prescott is planning to do
’two fifteen minute tapes of a
cut down version of the opera
lwith a spot on W01 in mind,
The arrangements for such a
broadcast are being made
through the Public Relations
Office. There is also a possibility
that the show may be televised.

as Mrs. Strug. Ozzie doesn't
claim to be a singer, but her
enunciation is clear and her
voice is pleasant. Bill Rex does
an excellent interpretation of
"Paris Is Like A Woman", one
of the finer arias in the show.

Kajun has done a lot of work
with comic opera and she again
puts in a good showing. The
smaller roles of the engaged
couple are handled by Johnson
and Tom Railsback who give
lcapable performances.

Opera Suggested

Last February, in that dining
hall infamous for bright thoughts
and innovations, Eager suggested
that Jim write a libretto. That
was the birth of the opera,
which all proves that inspiration
flows in the strangest atmos-
pheres.

Jim’s libretto injected quite a
bit of his personality, and the
puns are accented perfectly by
Roger‘s music. The show is well
integrated and promises to be a
lot of fun.
