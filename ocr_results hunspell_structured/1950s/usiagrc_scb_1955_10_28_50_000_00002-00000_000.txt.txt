5&3 Welcomes

The Scarlet and Black extends a cordial welcome to all
turning alumni. Even the graduates of last year will find
5i, variety 01' changes, some good, some otherwise. We have a
new president who will be formally inaugurated in two
weeks, We have a new (lean of men. We have a terrific
it‘eshman class. Lastly, we seem to have a new spirit which
was mi sing last year.

Dr. Bowen has shown us that a president need not sit

: hind a desk and think only about tlle college as another

entity to deal with. His keen interest in the students

om-ises that the next years will be the best in Grinnell’s

tory. His Roundtables, which by now are an accepted

: actice, have not made him an idol but one of the people

L'e feel free to confide in. It’s his chance to meet the stuc
rents and vice versa,

Harry Grace, dean of men, is another newcomer that

5 made himself known on thee campus. His ideas of

ldents controlling student'g'overnment has endeared him

in some and, naturally, made others question. He has placed

more control in the hands of the students. He has gone

.Ult of his wzly in many instances to see that the men are
treated fairly.

The freshmen brought with them a push that the 001*

"e needed. Their spirit at the football games has proven
,t’lat. Prepping or no prepping they've shaped up into what
,l-ill probably prove one of the best classes to graduate
. in this institution Cute gals have endeared themselves
ti the upperclass men. But most of all the spirit, could only

have come'with the freshmen.

Vt is our contention that your

ts

(A) We felt that because the
weekend was Parent‘s day, thc
sacs should have tricol to many

their affairs so that a lax-gr
paper was primed to COVEI'

(B) We would be interested
knowing when lootball has

In conclusion, we think that
0 paper has given the team

we believe you made an error

The Sound

The Fury

By Ari Vc‘riiwei's

Literary Criticism Dept.
When they said that VMaVe-
rick’s first issue'of the year
was to hit the,streets, T
didn't think the gutter was
the part of the street re-
ferred to. Appare' tL

While Grinnell literary mig—
:izincs have never seriously
rivnlletl the “Partisan Re~
View," they have been enter-
mining, innocuous, him, at
times, quite good (Witness
several issues oc'thc long since
departed “Malta. CL") Mayer
rick vis offended» common de-
cen ,

of prime concern is a cartoon
on page 23 labelled “Kiss". I
have been told that lhc reason
people don't thinkh's funny
is they don't understand it. i
doubt it. As far as I am con—
cerned i is the most repulsive
bit or perverted humor that I
have seen culsidc of these eight
page comic books which circus
late about the country, The story
entltled, “A erong Beau is
almost as bad in some of its dc-
scriphon. it is by thc same
aestheiic genius.

The instigatnr oi these atro—
cities, who shall remain name-
less. llils shamed the college,
the student body, and those
students who have contributed
to Maverick. As a student at
Grillncll, i would hate to see
this magazine (the one with
the cover like a corset ad, in
case you hivcn'l seen it) dlS-
played ns representative or
Grinnell taste. I would be
ashamed to show it in u pros~
pective student

The eal hlomc, perhaps. lies
not with the author so much as
with the cduorinl policy. The
avowed policy of Maverick is
a minimum of selectivity in
ordcr to bring a greater variety
or material hcrore thc students.
Such a plan leaves no safe-
guard against the lilci-nry Vomit
contained in its last issue.

The editors complain that
thcy arc hard-pressed for ma-
tcrinl, This is understandable.
Whnr student would take
plcnsurc in having his work
published in a magazine which
makes no effort to separate
the wheat from the chaff, and
is actually proud of it? It
certainly must have been a
blow to Pat Schrocdec to rind
her poem opposite “Kiss."

Perhaps I'm being pi-udish.
but I hope I speak im- the ma.
jority of the studcnts when 1
saw that the last issue of Mavor
rick was a gr injustice to the
Grinncll conununiiy Another
issue like the last one and i
hope Mavcrlck rots in the
mice for want or someonc to
buy it. rm inchncd lo agree

Save Your Money‘i Says Haynes;
‘See. Braggarl Warrior Tonight”

by Charlie Haynes

.Save your movie money tonight and step over to see
The Braggart War 'or in ARH auditorium at 800;- you
won‘t see a better show downtoun. Besides, how often do
you‘ see James Stewart bragging, and without June Allyson
oo. '

The Gl'innell Players production of this old Roman
romp is as refreshing as Spring Day, and Miss Judie Reget,
propel V improper as the Braggart's ultimate stumbling
block, as tasty a dish as —<
ever ced a bacchanal buf-

let.

As the (ly in the omtmenl or,
better; the“ sand in lhc Warrio -
armor, Dave Steiner is funny,
playing his incidious rolc likc
mi idlotic Iago.

You can hardly see Ron
Henry. playing the double
crossing dimer. lor 'l-iis icos-
tunic; he looks ins if he were
looking out the window when
the curtain rod broke. llllui‘ty

that good things come in small
packages.
