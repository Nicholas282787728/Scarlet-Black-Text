Trackmen Open
Year in North
Central Relays

Grinnell's indoor track squad
will open its season tomorrow
in the North Central relays, at
Neperville, 111. Last year the
Pioneers took fourth place in
the competition.

Coach E. G, Booth is hoping
to better last season’s perfoi»
mahce, but asserted that “it's too
early to make any predictions.”

Outstanding performer for
Grinnell will probably be Terry
Ellis, Midwest conference record
lholder in the shot put. Ellis
missed taking first place by one
inch in last year’s North Cenr

SCARLET AND BLACK

by George Drake

John Uzodinma first\ saw
Grinnell during Homecoming,
1950. The muscular boy from
Nigeria. West Africa, was a bit
confused; he thought the band
and parade were for him.

By the end of the day, he
was more than confused, he
was sick. He had just seen his
first football game, and his
stomach had rebelled at the
sight; he was afraid someone

was going to get killed.

John‘s come a long way in
his understanding of American
sports since then. Last fall. ,

Pfitsch, the only thing which
kept John from being a really
good player was his lack of un-
derstanding of the game.

John has had some preparation

string on the soccer tcam for
four years in high school in
0nitsha, Nigeria, a school of
about 700 students.

John is one or a family of
seven. His father, from whom
he inherits his magniliccnt
physique, is an automobile
dealer in 0nitsha.

Through a cousin in New
York, John became interested in
Grinnell. since coming here,
[John has earned his way
,through school with the aid or
ta scholarship. After his gradur
gallon, he will attend either the
istate University of lowa, or
loiva ‘State for graduate work
in some field of biology. Then
he will return to Nigeria.

John is impressed by the fast
pace of Americans, and by their
lack of interest in other counr
tries. He _gives as an example
that everyone thinks ot Africa
as infested 'by wild animals. The
first time in his life that he
saw a lion or an elephant was
