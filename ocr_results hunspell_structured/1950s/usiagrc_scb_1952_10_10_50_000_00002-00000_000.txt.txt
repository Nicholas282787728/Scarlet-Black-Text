Well?

Should the parcel post, laundry, and dry cleaning ser-
vices be centralized? Here are both sides of the question;
it is up to the students to find a solution.

When the decision was made. to combine laundry and
parcel post services at the heating plant, there seemed to
be advantages for both the students and the housekeeping
department For the students, it would mean a chance to
pick up packages any time during the working day, At the
same time, it would eliminate unnecessary handling, free-
ing trained laundry personnel from time-consuming tasks.
The dry cleaning service was incorporated in the merger
simply as a result of the theory, “the less handling, the
better.” Any profit would go to the laundry, which has
been operating on a deficit budget.

The students see another side of the question. They
complain of 'the inconvenient location and the bottleneck
caused by inadequate space to handle the combined services
for both sides of the campus. Rain and winter weather will
aggravate the situation. It is a fact, too, that the heat
of the laundry plant has melted candy mailed to students.
Finally, with a large number of students still seeking jobs,
many feel that it was unfair to take away the employment
created by the cleaning agency.

We advocate a change in at least one of the services.
There is no reason why the students can’t take over the
dry cleaning agency again. As for the parcel post, we sug-
gest a return to the old system, replacing laundry person-
nel with responsible student managers.

What do the students want? Should one service he
changed, or all of them be restored to their former loca-
tions? The decision rests with the students—if they are
willing to'tal'ie action. *
