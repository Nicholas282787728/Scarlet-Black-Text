Opportunity Knocks

In the first move of wllat we hope is not a “Russian.

peace offensive,” President Stevens has offered to con-
sider the opinion of the student body concerning the car
rule. We have an opportunity now to do some good, or to
do severe harm.

Any change in the car rule will very probably cut
down student attendance and participation at Weekend
events. Therefore the choice betweeli the offered altern»
atives must rest on its degree of change,

We think that second semester seniors should have
cars. We do not believe that the present rule should be re-
laxed for any other students.

Second semester seniors may have legitimate needs
for automobiles such as traveling to nearby cities for job
interviews, We feel that the rest of the student body does
not have the- same needs.

Participation in dances, plays, etc, gives us something
which spectating at professionals in Des Moines can‘t. The
experience of doing, rather than watching, is too valuable
to throw away.

Opportunity Knocked

A tradition was begun by this year’s Friars which
seemed to fill a gap in Grinnell social life. This Friday af~
tel-noon coffee hour was just beginning to establish itself
when we were informed that it has been discontinued. The
reasons behind this deci on are not clear. Certainly it was
not an expensive venture. It didn’t require much planning,
nor was there dissatisfaction expressed by those who at-
tended the gatherings.

It’s too bad that this weekly function has been allow-
ed to die. This will make it necessary for next year’s
Friar group to start something new all over again instead
of merely carrying on in an established manner. We do
feel, however, that the plan remains a good one, whether
it is the Friars or some other group who see fit to carry
it through.

Large Audience Applauds (Elrinnellz
Performance of ‘The Desert Song',

by Chuck Haynes

Grinnell college's first non»original musical comedy. “The
Desert Song,",was presented in the high school auditorium last
Friday night, with the drama and music departments teaming to
give an almost full house of professors, students and townspeoplel
as entertaining an evening as they could ask for.

Productionswise, the lighting, scenery and especially the cos-
tumes were all executed. with an over—all attempt at a light,
gay production, and organically this effect was ach' ved.

to keeping the show blithe and

Musically speaking the pro-
duction was better, and this is
usually thc case with a musical
show. The delightful Romberg
music helped buoy the perfor—
malice up although it scanned at
times that even the Riffs were

taking their light, toe tapping

song too seriously. It was hard
to tell if the cast was really

having fun putting on the show.

Nevertheless the audience
enjoyed every minute of the

an opinion, The combination of. .

little knowledge and many op
inions can lead to serious mis.
understandings and unfounded
prejudices.

Recent faculty cuts have pro-
duced such a situation. I don't
feel qualified to form an opinion
on such matters and 1 certain~
ly don’t wish to inﬂuence any»
one else. However, rvc asked a
few questions of a few persons
who are qualified to speak and
I can see no harm in passing
this information on.

We’re all aware that our
teachers have rank and that this
rank carries certain privileges,
particularly at the higher echo
lons. Among these piivilcgcs is
what is called “tenure." Full pro-
fessol's with certain seniority
have tenure and they may not
be discharged or laid off, exss
ccpt under the most unusual
circumstances. The tempo sys-,
tem has its parallels in industry
and business and is an dcccptcd
method of providing some sort
of security for capable persons
who have faithfully served on
organization for reasonably long
periods.

when we descend to the lowei‘l
levels of the academic totem polcl
we find, as we might cxpsct,l
that security decreases propo ‘
tionately with rank. Thus, when
the administrators of a college
are forced to economize by cut-
ting thc size of the faculty they
must cut instructors and assist
ant professors because they are,
the ranks which do not have
tenure and who are hired on
shorter term contracts. It is in-
evltible that, when such cuts arc
deemed necessary, Very compe»
tent and. often outstanding young
men will have to be let go. This
also has its parallels in other
walks of life.

The men who run Grinnell
college have been faced with a:
grim budget problem for at
least three years. I’ve been told
by reliable and impartial pro-,
fessors and administrators that
everything possible has been
done to avoid making faculty
cuts. Economy measures have
been enforced in every other
depa nent, beginning with the
administration itself.

Now the worst has happened.
The criSls, while it is only a
temporary one, has developed to
the extent that we must lose a
few very fine teachers. No one
is happy about this and, indeed,
no onc should be. On the other
hand,‘lhls seems to me to bc a
time for understanding rather
than reckless condemnation,

haustive. analysis of the entire
problem and, as a member of

good reason to believe that
more will be written on this
issue when the results of a care-
lul study are available. My only
wish is that we restrain our
judgment-making reflexes until
we know which end is up.

Arena Producﬁ

on 'The Rope,"

Impresses, Horriﬁes Audiences

by James Stewart

This week the Arena theatre completed a very exhaustive
schedule with the beautiful execution of the melodrama, “The
Rape,” directed by Nancy Weinfcld and John Springer, under the
supeersion of Kent Andrews, (speech).

The Grinnell audience was impressed as well as horrified by
the cold, impds ’vc, but intsnsly interesting murder committed by

Brandon and Williams.

in spite of a rather tedious ,
dialogue. James Leavenworth '
and Roger Perry portrayed
perfectly lhc thrill, suspicion,
and hnunting fear that ac-
companied the murder. Perry,
although a little quick to re-
veal his motion in the first
rose to a dramatic cli-
max in a very effective final
scene, which could have been
easily overdonel

Leavenworth, cold, strong, and
calculating, transmitted excels
lently the horrible beauty of
the entire experience,

John Springer turned in the
best performance othhe’ play
as Rupert, the foil to the mur-
der. His function in the plot
was momentarily forgotten amid
his sincere and convincing pass—
ages, showing the irony of mur-
der as lauded in war and cons
demned in other contexts for
more justified reasons,

The “mass" scenes were a
little confused and it was
difficult to maintain an at-
mosphere of tension, but can-

 

sidering the barrier of a close
stage and too many people,
helped by the atmosphere of
naturalness interjeeted by
Nancy Nattemer, everyone did
an admimhlc job. '
Special mention should be
made about the beautiful set,
constructed by Andrews and
cohorts. The detail was com-
plete, from imaginative grill
outline to a, very realistic fire
in the fireplace.
