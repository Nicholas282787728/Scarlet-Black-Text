August 23, 1871, under the direction
and withthe assistance of President
Magcuu the "Iowa College News Let-
ter” was ﬁrst published, appearing as
adepartmeiit of "The Grinnell Her~
aid.” The success of the undertaking
wm immediate and quite a general in-
terest was aroused among thestudents
In June 1873 permission was obtained
to publish the “News Letter” as a
separate paper under the general
super-vision of the faculty. It was
published by the News Letter Associ-
ation composed of members of the
three-college lltsrarr societies: 'In'
July, 1873 ‘-Tbe.Coliege NewsLetter,"

pages 11xlii inches appeared and this
was enlarged in December or the some
year to aixili inch pages

Tire Board of Editors originally con-
sisted otﬁve persons, one from each
college literary society and two from
the News Letter Association but with
the organization or the Ellis Society
in 1882 one more was added. The ASe
sociatlon also elected a business man-
ager who had no voice in the editorial
management.

For seven yeais ll appeared monthy

week of the quarter-centeniol celebra.
tion of 1875 as a daily. In 1882 the size
was increased to twelve pages and for
that year and for 1830 it was issued
every three weeks.

in February, 1889 feeling that the
"News Letter" did not fully meet the
desires of the college,studenls brought
forth “The Pulse” published ' fort-
nightly. The two papers were com-
biued in 1390 under the name of “Tile
Unit,” published bi-weekly,

In September, 189-! was founded the
semi-weekly, “Seaman asp BLACK”
but ﬁnding that two could not, both
live in the some ﬁeld, "The Unit“ was
changed to lbs present magazine form
and the managing boards were com-

separated and since that Lime ille par

PROFESSOR BUCK AT CHAPEL.

l-lalf Hour Sketch Given oldie History
of l we College Fiaancially,and of
Its Present Resources.

Yesterday morning in chapel l’l'o~
fessor Buck gavcamuch needed and
much appreciated talk on the history
and present stiitusof the college finan-
ces. This question is always one or
more orlrss mystery to the ordinary
strident because the finances of the col-
lege are kept in the background to a
surprising extent and no doubt very
wisely so, but as Professor Buck stated
it is well that. we should know some of
the facts.

Tire college had a very humble be.
The
story is that when the few men who

ginning but a very sincere one.

were ellerishiilg the hope or an Iowa
College met in Davenport, one threwo.
dollar upon the table and called [or the
election of a college treasurer, The
gifts during the next few years were
small but were given by men who knew
how to give and many a man sacriﬁced
his own comforqthat the youthful col»
lege might grow, The ﬁrst large gilt
came from Deacon Carter or Connecti-
cut, $5030. A few years after this Mr.
Williston gave 320,000 for the presided
cy with aconditionai 010,000 in addi
tion. In 1886 Hon. Oakes‘A mes pledg-
ed 00000 which was ultimately realized,
and in the same year Mr. Dodge gave
010,000 toward the clialr of chemistry.
In 1869 the endowment toward a chair
of Latin was completed by $10,000 from
Mr. Benedict. In 1870 the college had
four proiesscrs, all able, Godtcaring
men who were putting their whole
li \‘esilnto tilislittlewestern inslllui ion
The Stoneiand theSLeele professorships
of $20,000 each were next given and in
1889 friends of L. F. Parker gave the
Parker chairof history and later hirsE,
D.Iiand of Burlington gave a chair in ap
plied Christianity. Since 1803 the col-
lege has received over $100,000.’ Be»
sides these special endowments there
are many special funds in the general
endowment of the college, such as the
Alumni, :Grimes, Magoun, Woman‘s
Dept and other funds. The college
has been very fortunate in keeping its
money and has not only kept it but by
careful investment hasincreased it un-
til at, present it is worth by careful as»
tlnlales $300,000 and when the present
campaign for money is over it is hoped
that this amount will have swelled to
a round million, '

The prosperity or the college has
been due largely to a very faithful and
devoted body oftrustcesand professors
who have not cnly_used conservative
business judgment but liavecommand-
ed the respect oi every one who knew
them. It. is such men in the past who
have brought Iowa College to the front
rank of western colleges and it issuch
men who are to keepvherthers in the
future.

gram with the beautiful ‘reatiing

and thrilling chords of the music
which Strauss has composed for the
great poem, together With its dranlat»
icaiiy sympathetic recital by Proicssor
tyan made such a combination as
held the audience spellbound for one
andahaif hours. Seldom is it the
good fortune of even a college audi-
ence to listen to so excellent a number-
in the eiocuoionary line. Reader and
accompanist were both at their best
and their periormancc will long be a
pleasant memory to those fortunate
enough to hear them.

For the second part of the program
the members crossed to the Rand
Gymnasium where another surprise
was awaiting them, Standing on the
track above the ﬂoor they could look
down upon small rabies arranged as a
united e and E, for Chresromathian-
