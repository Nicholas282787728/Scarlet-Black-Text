the scarlet and black

Martial arts and drug mules

Marla Full of Grace (

The Career Development Ofﬁce doesn’t
list any job-opportunities as dnrg mules for
Grinnell graduates, and Maria Full of Grace
explains why. The raison d'étre of this frlm is
to show how bad Maria (Catalina Sandiuo
Moreno) has it.

ingesting Colombian heroin is not the first
awful job out Colombian heroine has. She
starts off the movie as a laborer for a ﬂower
plantation, suipping the thorns off roses,
which rs a metaphor, I suppose. Maria leaves
her job and her family because ofan accidental
prcgnancy in a loveless relationship Desperate
for money, she meets a man who takes her to a
drug dealer, and the rest is cinemagic!

This film is unflinchrrrg in its portrayal of
Maria's desperation to survive and create some
sort oflife for licrsclfand her child. Unﬂinchr
ing, but also unsurprising. Throughout the
movle, you almost always know what’s going
to happen next. This frlm does not have the
ﬂashincss or conspicuous drug use that other
“drug movies" like Rcyrrrern ﬂa- n Dr-carrr or
T711171: have, a more apt comparison. That’s
because this isn't really a frlm about drugs, ale
though at times every audience member can al—
most feel the grape—sized pellets sliding down
their throats. M/m'rt Full omeu instead Casts
its gazc on those drawn into the drug trade out
ofeconomic desperation or greed.

This frlms tagline haughtily claims to be
“based on 1,000 true stories." Maybe it’s :l
shame that I'm so desensitized to these stories,
butI found nothing shocking or gripping about
this particular tale. Moreno is quite gracehrl as
Maria; her blank face somehow expresses so
much subtle emotion, and the visions of Co-
lumbiaand NewYorkCity look gritryand real,
but I wish this movie strove for more than just
dlspassionatcly documenting what is inargrre
ably an awful life that so many people endure

N oleon Dyna te (P

Very little actually happens in the movie.
The nrinimal plot involves main character
Napoleon Dynamites (ion Hedet) crush on
shy Deb (Tina Mnjorino), and his efforts to
help his newly befriended fellow misfrt Pedro
(Efren Ramirez) become class president. The
test of the movie consists of following Napo—
leon around and meeting his eccentric friends
and tamily.

The movie rs very much about the chair
acters, all of whom are slightly oﬂheat. What
makes the movie so funny is
that the actors aren't saying their
lines for lauglrseedrcy gcrnrinely
believe in their characters, and
immerse themselves in small-
town Idaho life without think-
irrg or the audience, What we
got is an honest, unscntimcntal
film about quirky people liying
their fairly boring lives. And
those people are worth meeting.

Napoleon is the quintes-
sential high school misfit He
lives in a tantasy world otmagie
cal creatures and has fuzzy red
hair and big glasses. And when
he isn’t getting slammed into his
locker by the jocks at school, he
whiles away the days at his high
school playing tethetball with
himself. He's not thc “what a
good guy; why does everyone
pick on him?" misfit here of
many teen underdog frlms, but
a fairly pushy and surly fellow
who ends up winning you over.

MTV’s TRL. and his three albums with
The Pharmacists, including Shah in smart,
released last month and on KDIC’s rotae

Monday's concert is politically timely.
Leo shares Grinnell's post-election emo-
tions. In an entry to his blog on Nov. 3, after
detailing a hellish part of his current tour
that included a broken van, a canceled show
and a dead pet dog in addition to Bush’s
victory, Leo declared “I'm going to tucking
war. i won't be driven out of my home by
these Hulls unless they drive me straight to
Hell. so hopefully I’ll see you all there...
Everyone should bring many percussion inr

dont see in very many movies. You may not
like Napoleon, but you don’t have to. The ﬁlm's
appeal is in its moments, those that capture the
brilliant absurdity oflife. It is a tribute to the
geek in all otus.

Hero (PG 13)

Hem is a Chinese action/drama with ﬂoat-
ing swordfightets and Jet Li's buttecheek, but
you will still like it. Probably. This movie is
new to America, bllt not to the rest of the
world. It was released through the efforts
of Mirilrnax and Qlelitin Tarantino. There
was solne argument regarding the movie’s
length: Mira-nix believed that
20 minutes of the movie were
“too Asian and confusing" tor
lls Vl/csterners, so one version is
90 minutes, and the other is 110.
VVhlch one will you be watch-
ing? Actually, I don't know.

Anyway, Hot-c celebrates a
man (1e! Ll; Kiri 0/1/11 Dmgmi,
7716 On: and Romeo Mm! Die)
who has taken the lives ofthree
ofhis emperor's wouldebc assase
sins. He sits before the emperor
and recounts his tale oftact and
swordsmanship. over the course
of the frlm, multiple (and cone
flrcting) versions ofthis story are
told and each brings surprising
new information. The story is
not as straightforward as it once
seemed.

Don’t worry about any con-
fusion, though. Enjoy Hera
for the beautiful movie that it
is; the plot will unfold natu-
rally over time. The scenery is
amazingipractically out of an
IMAX filmiand the costumes

are excellent, though often simple. The colt
ors of the clothing are eycrcatching and they
ﬂow beautifully in swordfrghts. Additionally,
you'll notice that each story is color-coded
with different—colored costumes.

This frlm adcprly tackles the major themes
oflove, sacriﬁce, and honor. Because ofHem’s
subtle and meditative natttre,l advise Grill-
nell College students not to see this while
under the influence. You will not enjoy it as
much and you’ll disturb others contemplar
lions.

lntcrspcrscd in the drama, you will see
plenty of weapons moving quickly and hear
many yells and metal clanging noises: the
substance of all good sword frghrs. some of
you have seen Cmtle/Jlng Tigerr Hidden Drape
mi.Well, the ﬁghting style isjust the same, so
if you don’t like it when people ﬂoat or walk
on water, part ofthis movie will piss you off.

Yet, you may appreciate some aspects of
the martial arts. Some swordsmen bow out
when they are defeated (instead of dying),
and even when blood is shed, you will not see
it. The focus is on the art or ballet offighting,
not on its gate.

From battles within the mind (literally) to
battles fought on top ofwatet, you will see in-
teresting choreography. This movie's plot and
action are worth the 90 or 110 minutes you
will spend on it.
