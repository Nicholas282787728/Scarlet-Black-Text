The Iowa caucuses are known for their "live

Ambassador, Plame husband campaigns for Clinton

BVJULIA Borncs

On the second ﬂoor of the Joe Rosenﬁeld Center on Monday,
Oct. 15, students and community members alike awaited the arrival
of former ambassadorJoe Wilson. Gtinnell Students for Hillary and
Clinton's campaign hosted the event in hopes that Wilson could
convert some audience members to Hillary’s campaign.

Although a diplomat in the State Department for 23 years,
Wilson's fame currently tests on his status as former CIA operative
Valerie Plame’s husband. Flame has been an icon {or the American

Wilson, gravely throated from an entire day of
speaking, shrugged oirhis jacket and settled down
at the head ofthe packed room.“l think the caucus

a description of his service with the diplomatic corps.

Drawing on his experiences as a member of the American
embassy in Iraq, Wilson had harsh words for the current admin-
istration’s actions in that country, starting by attacking them for
misrepresenting information. “When the government makes the
most solemn of decisions, we the American people ought to un-
derstand what we are asking them to do,"Wilson said.

tion." After such comments, rhcre remained little doubt as to
Wilson‘s dissatisfaction with the current administration's policy in
the region. “I just think this Republican Party has been hijacked
by radicals," he added later.

Wilson's criticism of the Bush ad-
ministration's military intervention tran-
sitioned unsurprisingly into an exposition
ofsenaror Clinton's virtues as a political leader during the Iraq War.
He argued that Clinton was one of the only members of either

No campaign srump speech would be
complete without the addition of some per
sonal anecdote to accompany an endorsement;
Wilson did not fail to disappoint on this not
count, Along with describing the handsron rolc
Clinton took as ﬁrstladyin planning President
Bill Clinton’s groundbreaking llrday trip to
Africa in the "305, he highlighted C on's
compassion. Describing the time immediately after the leaking of
Flames identity, Wilson said that, “During our darkest days, one
voice reached out to us to remember that this is bigger than the
two ofus and that was Hillary Clinton."

Wilson closed his talk with an appeal to students. “You guys
are the future of this country," he said, “This is about the sort of
country that you guys grow up in,"

In the lengthy question and answer session that followed, Wil-
son helded qucsrions on a variety or topics ranging trorri Clinton’s
suitability as president to the Israel-Palestinian conﬂict.Throughout

his answers,Wilson emphasized whar he saw as Clinton's ability r

about Clinton's foreign policy views from one of her advisors. “I
like hearing about Hillary’s rereign policy," Rosemarie Ofrord '0

said.

special interests, and said that because ofa large Jewish population
with elTeetiVe lobbying power, their interests will naturally be more
vocally represented. .

Johnson said that this was an infuriating answer and ensured
her opposition to Clinton's candidacy. “I am absolutely, 100 per-
cent not going to vote for Hillary speciﬁcally [because of] what
he said," Johnson said, becoming angry. “What he said about the
Jewish community bring more active and that’s why they have a
bigger voice was bullshit. seeing him kind of tour that party line
really struck me badly.“

Most students, Johnson’s reaction nonvithstanding, came away
trom the event feeling positive about Wilson and glad to have
learned more about Clinton, Mikel Shybut '10 said both factors
drew him to see Wilson speak. “Ijust wanted to heat more about
Joe Wilsons story," Shybut said. “I thought he would be kind of
interesting, him being the husband of Valerie Flame, and hear
more about Hillary from another perspective and get her kind of
international perspective."
