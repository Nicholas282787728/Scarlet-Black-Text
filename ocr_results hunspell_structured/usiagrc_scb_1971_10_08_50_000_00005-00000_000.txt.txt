“I think it essential, to the
American system of govern~
ment, particularly in a time of
crisis in confidence in that
government, that dissenting
views be presented clearlyand
squarely for decision by those
who are governed.”

The above message, issued
by Congressman Paul N. Mc'
Closkey, Jr. (Rep.-Califorv
nia), strongly contradicts the
spirit of Senator Barry Gold-
water‘s sentiments, as quoted
here last week, that ”Ibelieve
all good Republicans ~ in-
deed, all good Americans ,,
should Stand behind their
President and supporthispolr
icies all the way”. This week’s
column introduces ”Pete"
McCloskey, the "rebel candir
date" for the presidential
nomination of the Republican
party.

“To find the truth, to speak
the truth and to live the truth
that’s what we will do."

This above,although compat-
ible with his feelings, is not a
quote from Congressman Mc-
Closkey. Rather, these words
came from Mr. Richard Nixon
in a speech delivered to the
Republican Convention in
1968. And herein lies the basis
for the McCloskey challenge:

“Had thepresidentlivedup to
this statementofhighpurpose
and his statement in 1968 to
Congressman Don Riegel
(Rep-Michigan) that we would
end the war in 6 months if he
were elected, I would not be
challenging him today."

The war is a basic issue in
McCloskey's campaign, for he
believes that it should be
ended solely on the condition of
the return of American prir
soners, and that "we shouldbe
big enough to admit our mis-
takes." But the war is cerr

ANAlYSIS from page 1

This year $62,000 from col-
lege and SGA funds will be
spent for 0utside*the*class*
room, all-college public
events. If budgeted wisely,
this total can be sufficient,
in my opinion, to obtain the
"mix" that will satisfy most
members of the college com-
munity. But because these
funds are initially divided
among at least fourteen dif-
ferent independently radr
ministered programs of var-
ious sizes and purposes, and
then further subdivided into
about thirty more “funds,"
coordination is at best hap~
hazard and some very import
tant types of events are ex
tremely difficult to finance.
With such a system, it is
surprising that we have as
good a public events program
as we do; with improvements,
we could do much better.

In order to understand how
the whole system works, let
us look at some of the fea-
tures ofourpresent operation.
Public events money comes
from two sources: all~college
funds supply about $28,000
and Student Activities Fees
about $34,000. Almost half
of the college~provided funds
($13,000) are allocated to the
Black Students’ Coordinating
Committee to be used specr
ifically for black academic,
cultural, and artistic pro
grams.

Five separate Iectureship
and/or symposium program
sponsors receive more than
one fourth of the college
provided funds ($6800). Ant
other $4,000 of college funds
“trickle down" in very small
amounts ($50 to $400) to all
the academic departments.

tainly not, as some critics
claim, McCloskey's only is
sue.

McCloskey has been OLIISPO’
ken on civil rights:

“When Nixonms facedwitha
situation in Michigan where he
could use the term 'encourag‘
ing integration’ or talk about
‘forced integration', he chose
to use the word 'forced'. The
choice of language is indicér
tive ofa lack ofmoral leader-
ship in the White House on
civil rights. That is what we
are missing. We need an A-
merimn president who can
stand up and say, 'Every
American ought to search his
heart and find it within him to
end this underlying insult to
a black man by refusing to let
him live in a white suburb!"

But above and beyondall oth-
er issues, faith of the people
in their government is vital
to McCloskey. “Faith can be
restored only when we can
trust the government and what
it says."

“i am just tired of beinglied
to by members of the execue
tive branch and having infor-

The remaining money (about
$4000) is allocated for musir
cal events by guest perform-
ers.

SGA moneys forpublicevents
are i, dgeted through the all-
student Social Coordinating
Committee (about$30,000)and
the newly established Initia'
tive -Cultural Rind ($4,000).
The Social Coordinating Com-
mittee divides its funds ac
cording to specific use. The
54000 Initiative- Cultural Fund
plans to allocate money to as
widerranging and as large a
number of events of a cul-
tural nature as possible.

If we stop long enough to
consider the size and admin
istration of these funds, sevr
eral problems become evie
dent. Let’s compare some of
the figures. Roughly $24,000
from SGA funds is spent on
large and small rock, jazz,
blues, and folk performances
while the total amount avail-
able for all other lectures,
symposia, and other types of
related activites is only about
$29,000. More than $6,000 is
spent to rent films for week
end evenings; all academic
department combined have
readily available a total of
only $4000 for outsideﬂhe’
classroom activities. Come
pare the $6000 film budget to
the roughly $7500 figure for
all other collegerwide-lecr
tureships and symposiums.

What are the reasons for
these budgeting anamolies? I
feel they could be termed
problems of scheduling phil-
osophy, widely decentralized
funding, and lack of calendar
planning.

The present scheduling phil‘
osophy dictates thatalmostall
public events except symr
posiums and lectures be
scheduled on weekend evens

mation concealed, and i think
they have fallen into the habit
of lying, not just to the people
and to the press but to Cone
gress. I ran into direct exV
amples of this in Laos and
Vietnam -- deceptive briefs
ings Where they would lead us
to believe that certain facts
existed and we would find out
later they did not exist."

But McCloskey’s disillusionr
ment with the Nixon Admini-
stration's credibility extends
far beyond the situation in
Southeast Asia.

"We in Congressare become
ing increasingly aware that
this administration gives us
only those facts which support
their policies, and is willing
to conceal or distort the facts
on the other side.“ Thus, as
a part of his campaign, Mcr
Closkey has chosen to cite
each week an instance of the
fusal to give the full truth to
the Congress and the public.

McCIoskey's reaction to this
is that it is ”a sorrycommen-
tary on our federal govern*
ment when its representa-
tives feel the harsh facts of
the economy have to be con-
cealed from the publicin order
to maintain a rosy glow ofsucr
cess and confidencein the wis-
dom and policies of those in
power."

It is interesting t0n0te,hOW‘
ever, that McCloskey's own
credibility itself has been
challenged. How can an “anti-
war' ' Congressman vote in
favor of the draft? Since this
is a stumblingrblock of partir
cular concern to students and
young people, I've quoted Mc-
closkey’s views hereat length
and in detail. Ithink one will
find that his decision to sup-
port the draft is not at all out
of character.

“The arguments over the

ings. With this philosophy,
there are so many hours of
entertainment time to fill that
big funds must necessarily be
broken down toachievea shot-
gun type program“ something
for everyone all the time.

Because there are many
groups on the campus that
want money, most sizeable
funds are broken down into
small components. Itbecomes
imperative, in order to get
enough money for an expenr
sive event, to coordinate and
combine money from several
small budgets. Often this c0r
ordination takes a consider-
able amount of time and ef—
fort, but it must take place
before a contract can be signed
with an entertainer. In large
part because of coordination
problems, activities oftenpile
up in one month such as it did
last April when there were
events almost every day.

Nobody formally plans the
college calendar at this time.
If centralized oversight of
public events were accom*
plished, the scheduling philoV
sophy and decentralized bud-
geting problems would not be
nearly so damaging. This
planning function couldbe per
formed by a small dedicated
group of faculty and students
who would keep tabs of all
these funds, aid coordination
and oversee longer-range
scheduling. Such a group
should be given a budget of
their own, probably from ex-
isting sources, so that events
of general interest that can-
not be funded Otherwise, can
be brought to Grinnell.

Good sense shows that the
present public events system
should be reviewed and re-
vised. In these days of tight
budgets, such a review is
especially imperative.

"Surf's Up"l The Beach
Boys are back with still an-
other album, and it's good to
hear from them. One thing
which makes a group great is
the ability to change their
sound and still produce great
music. The Beatles, of course,
were always at the top because
of this ability to change; they

, influenced change consistent
1y. The Beach Boys are ans
other group who have come a
long way and still soundgreat.
They are, I feel the most
underrated and overlooked
group in rock.

There is one basic problem
with this album. The Beach
Boys try to present a theme
throughout many of the songs
and it just doesn’t come off
well; it seems corny and
passe. They're now "into"
ecology, and since every-
body‘s “into" ecology, their
"protest" is net toopowerful.
The group does better when it
stays away from the "issues";
their "music" is great.

“Don't go Near the Water"
is the opener and it's typical
Beach Boy harmony. It’s a
slow song which is similar to
“Heroes and Villians." The
words here are particularly
corny, but the music, from the
first few notes, lets the lisr
tener know that the Beach
Boys are still the best Amer-
ican voml group around,

“Long Promised Road" is
next, a song by Carl Wilson.
He hasn't written much, but
when he does, it turns out
beautifully. The lyrics are
far from 1963, and again, a
bit too much. “So hard to lift
the jeweled sceptre/When the
weight turns a smile to a
frown."

“Take a Load offYour Feet"
is by Alan Jardinc, and it’s a
mediocre song at best. How~
ever, the more I hear it the
more I like it, so bynext week
it may be a very good song.
It's a bouncy, footetapping
song, but at times it sounds
like a television jingle!

“Disney Girls(1957)"isnext
and it’s great. It's Erucejohnr
ston's" (John Onstad's dou-
ble)~ only contribution,
which is too bad. He's been
writing some very goodmusic
lately. The lyrics are excels
lent, and they fit the slow,
harmonic sound of the music.
"Reality, it’s not for me/And
it makes me laugh/Fantasy
world and Disney girls? I’m
coming back."

This is followed by HStu-
dent Demonstration Time”,
a remake of the old song
”Cellblock Number 9". Mike
Love wrote the lyrics, and

The Scarlet and Black

‘McCIoskey: GOP’s Rebel‘Candidate"

the real problem today lies in
attempting to equate "honor"
with our present policies in
Vietnam."

As the ”New York Times"
said July 12; “One can en-
thusiastically agree with Pete
McCloskey; one can violently
disagree. But, after watching
him speak, it is hard to chal-
lenge the depth of his convic-
tions and sincerity...”

again they're a little preten-
tious, but this may only be
because we’re not used to
hearing the Beach Boys talk
of Kent State and People‘s
Park. The song is great. it’s
a driving blues number and
Love handles it well.

”Feel Flows" opens side
two, and it's another “typi-
cal" Beach Boy song, with
great harmony. It’s another
song which must be played
more than once before you’re
able to judge. There‘s a great
instrumental interlude in this
number, complete with flute,
an unusual Beach Boy sound.

“Looking at Tomorrow (A
Welfare Song)" follows. It's
a simple song, with a strong
acoustical guitar sound. It
sounds a bit like a song Len-
non wouid sing. The song
builds with french horns and
organs, but it stays soft. It’s
one of the very good songs on
the album.

“A Day in the Lifeofa Tree"
is next. Brian Wilsonlplays
the part of a tree, who sadly
sings of suffering in the midst
of pollution. The idea once
again comes out corny and
overdone, and Wilson‘s sing»
ing is buried in overproducr
(ion. The organ sounds like a
church mass.

"Til I Die" is another of
Brian’s songs and this one is
incredibly beautiful. The har-
monies are the best on the
record and even the lyrics
make it. "I'm a leaf on a
windy day/Pretty soon I'll be
brown away/How long will the
wind blowi/Until I die."This
song, along with the last song,
is one I play over and over
and I still can't believe how
such a simple song can sound
so great. All the Beach Boys’
talent can be measured in this
one song.

“Surf’s Up" is the title cut
and it's the last song; another
great production number by
Brian Wilson. Beach Eloy fal-
setto really gets moving in
this song, and Brian hits the
highest note probably ever hit
in rock. The song builds from
the beginning and finisheswith
great fiverpart harmony.

This album is a continuation
of ”Sunflower" and could be
just as good, in time. The
Beach Boys are now trying to
push their lyrics but this is
where they fail. They are
trying far too hard to be
serious. But their music is
far from dead. Musically,
"Surf's Up” is a superb al-
bum, a must for Beach Boy
fans~(past AND present)--
and anyone who enjoys great
singing and good musicshould
listen to it.
