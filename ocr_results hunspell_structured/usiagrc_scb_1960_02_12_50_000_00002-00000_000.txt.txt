Control. Not Cokes, Is Issue

Student council nominations and elections are three
weeks away, and already campaign promises ‘. re being
whispered and potential election issues being discussed.

We are not interested in coke machines, milk mach-
ines, vacation dates, posted agendas and concerts as isslfes
in the election. It should be understood and assumed that
the Student council and its president will reﬂect student
opinion on these issues. To make sweeping campaign
promises about such things is the same as a milk man
who promises his boss that he will deliver the milk.

The real ‘issue in this election is student government

dents. “it‘s interesting." A few

involvc

ad, and then a gay comedy

'of audience participation ensues.

The string constructions,
evidently the most stimulat»
lug, have called forth coin-
inciits like “They remind me
of the dissections of muscles
in bio lab," or "I get caught
in the‘ places where the
strings cross, and I just can‘t
get out.” These string com-
positions have also presented
an amazing spectacle when
surrounded by art students
assiduously analyzing them for
line,

The reason for the string con-
structions is obvious if one
stops fidgeting about Miss Ful-
lcr‘s meticulous technique and
really looks at the composi-
tions, especially in relation to
the rest of the exhibition,

Sue Fuller’s guardian muse:
or whatever unpredictable
spirit has tharge 0f artists,
was certainly on its toes when
it suggested string to Miss
Fuller. Her Water CULDXS are
amorphous puddles of clay-
ing, colored perfume; hei- col-
lages, hits of memorabilia in-
triguing in detail but oouius—
ing in combination, Her two
studies of bamboo are only
trite variations on an orien-
tal theme. The string oon-
strucﬁons Alone save her.

Miss Fuller‘s string paintings
represent an original concept'
of artistic expression. She has
made a valuable thievcry grom
geometry and has adapted it to
her own ends. Mathematics be-
comes art, and art becomes
music; the taut strings define
e x t r e m e l y graceful shapes
which overlap and echo each
other, almost like sounds in an
empty space.

The clean abstraction of the
string construction provides a
momentary reliei from the
emotional sensationalism and
the rreuoian soul—searching
of most contemporary art. But
like most total abstractions
iii the visual arts, it fills
out its potentialities in a very
short time; its lack of human
interest is limiting.

fAIlen Versus Ellison In Review
The ,Ot Fuller Art Exhibit In Main

by Laurel Ellison

In a magazmc interview, Sue
Fuller ,says that the most do
lightfui aspect 01 hcr string
compositions is the way light
shifts and plays on the threads
when she sets the strong frame
in thc sun. This pleasure, how-
ever, she eliminates for us by
backing the frames with pain.
fully blue or pink material
(reminiscent of Ono’s grand—
mother": corsetry), cutting out
all but the front. entrance or
light,

Even with “whacking. the
compositions are eye-catching
simply because string arrange. ‘
merits are new to us, but they
are never lustingly interesting.
A iew or them do manage to
break away irom trite color
schemes, and one, “String
Composition No. 70," does
create a dramatic iorce
through its asymmetrical are
rangement. The rest may be
“restful" because they are
static and repetitious in design
but thcy have no potential for
“growing," on the observer.

Most of Miss Fuller’s waters
colors, gouachcs and silkscreens
are sloppily, unintcrcstingly and
often sentimentally done, with
sick color.

Miss Fuller uses iasciooting
Japanese papers, stamps and
designs in her collages, which
gives them a wonderiul tex-
tural excitement. However, the
observer begins to wonder if
the artist doesn‘t depend too
rouch on the intrinsic quali—
ties of her materials and not
enough on her own handling
oi them.

Many of the shapes and dc-
signs arc clumsily or arbitrar
ily placed, and she crowds all
the patterns together, to the ob.
server's confusion. Although in,
tercstiiig in detail, seen as a
whole they appear to be very
patchwork—lsh. This is the imr
pression l have of the exhibit
as a whole. Miss Fuller seems
to have played with many difr
ferent media without achieving
a remarkable competence in any
of them. ‘
