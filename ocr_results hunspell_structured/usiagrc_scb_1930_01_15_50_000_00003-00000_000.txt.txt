EXTRA.

The Doric is publishing today the
scoop of a century, We have at last
found the formula for making
straight A grades, and generous and
big hearted people that we are, we
are passing it on to all our dear read-
ers, This dorictoriel is very timely,
coming just before final examina-
tions. Persuse these lines, thou
sluggards. and ye shall find pearls of
wisdom, cost before swine.

Five Simple itules For Making

. Straight A.

Rule L Laugh thou heartily when
thy professor desireth to make mer-
I'y with a joke, ef thou hast heard
the joke into a weariness.

Rule 11. Bring thy lessons weu pre-
pared, even unto the smallest par-
tiole whereot thy professor hast
made mention.

Rule in. See that thou giggle not,
neither chew thou the nefarious
gum, nor gaze at the view, while thy
protessor disoourseth concerning the
wonders whereof he teneheth.

Rule IV. Absent thyself not, par-
ticularly when thy professor admin-
istereth a written examination.

iiulo v. Give thou many and volum-
inous "special reports," for by this
means alone, dearly beloved, shall
thou endear thyself to the heart of
thy professor.

We wonder if it is exclusively a
house chairman's priviledge to inter-
rupt a most important league board
meeting and call one of the young
ladies to the ’phone under the pre-
text of “very important business"
and ask her to attend the weekly
varsity. Can anyone do it, or must
such popularity be deserved? 0r,
like Crepe Nuts, “Is there a rea-
Son?”

Now that the snow abounds on all

sides, the Doric sees no reason why

 

iiosc, the rtndy Vuliee at Clark Hail,
cannot schedule hob-parties without
end, and we might also add, that this
picture would not be complete with-
out a certain co-od from Cottage
Three.

Chuck Woody has entered the
realm oi professionalism, and can no
longer ligitimately lead the Grinnell
cheers. It has been discovered that
he accepted money for his expose of
Parish at the basketball game the
other night. me on you, Charles,

care, though, for this show would
prevent any picnics, anyhow.

Clark and Langan Take Two
Games, With Two’s B
Win Yesterday.

Scores:

Clark a, 23; Smith A, 17

Clark B, 14; Smith B, 7

Three A, 23; Dibble A, 21

Dibble B, 19; Three B, 7

Langnn B, 11; Foul- B, 9

Combining speed with teamwork,
nn under-rated Building Three A
team snatched a hard-fought victory
from Dibbie's A team Saturday by
the score of 23-21. This was only
one of a number of surprises that
featured the opening games of the
intramural basketball series. Lan-
gan hall's A quintet also upset the
dope by defeating Building Four’s A
team, 15-12. The other three games
resulted in wins for the favorites
with Clark hall taking both her
games from Smith and Dibble B
trouncing the B team from Kelly
Stables. Yesterday the last game of
the ﬁrst round again returned Lain»
gan a victor, this time her B team
defeating Four's B team by a Score
of 11-9. This leaves Langan and
Clark in the lead with two wins
each,

Clark Hall a found the going rath-
er rough in the ﬁrst half of the
Smith-Clark game but forged steadi-
ly ahead in the second half, taking
the lung end of a 28-17 count. The
Smith ﬁve, led by the ﬁne shooting
of Spencer kept the Five boys guess-
ing at the start, but seemed to lack
the scoring punch as the game pro-
gressed. The last half was all
Clark’s, Mcl'lralh WES Clark's
“big gun" and proved to be high
score man of the game with it points
to his credit.

Score at end of ﬁrst quarter 2-2,
score at end of half 4-4. That was
the kind of a game that Clark B and
Smith B played. During the next

 

half the five big boys from Clark
dropped the ball through the hoop
just a little oftener than the midgets
from Smith and won the game 14-7.

Dibble B had an easy time with
Three B, winning 19-1. Heldridge's
dead eye and Kiesel's floor work were
the outstanding characteristics of
the game.

Then came the “battle royal",
Kelly Stables was out on the ﬂoor to
revenge the defeat just administer-
ed to their B team, and Dibble was
out to make a clean sweep of their
games and thus go into a tie with
Clark, Dibble lost because Woody
was too clever, McIntlre too good a
shot, and Davis too fast, Farrara
of Dibble did throw a scare into the
ranks of the Kelly Stables team in
the last two minutes of play when
he successfully converted two tries
into four points, Molntire netted 12
points and Fararra found the basket
for 11.

in the last game of the afternoon,
Langan A won over a team that beat
itself. Building Four a just could-
n’t get going and when they did they
usually lost the ball by a poor pass.
Langan led the entire game. but Four
staged a half-heated rally in the last
quarter which brought them within
one point of tying the score. Kent,
Alexander, and Jones did good work
for Langan, while Sweeney, Richey
and St. John looked like Four's best
threats,

in a slow but rather close game
played yesterday, Building Four's
“B" team lost to Langm‘s “B” team
11 to 9. Bowlby played the best
game for Four and was high point
man as well, securing three baskets.
For Langan, Bilto and Briggs were
the outstanding players,

Chemistry Movies
Begin Yesterday

The first of the regilar winter ser-
ies of chemistry moving pictures
was shown in the chemistry lecture
room at 4:30 yesterday. One film
told the story of nitrate of soda;
the other, entitled "Ocean Tears,"
concerned sodium chloride. or table
salt.

Professor Sherman intends to en-
gage further films, besides eleven
that are already booked. They will
all be shown in the chemistry lec-
ture room on afternoons at 4:30, and
usually on Wednesday afternoons;
but some are now booked for Tues-
days and perhaps cannot be changed.
All the films now arranged for come
from Ames, but Professor Sherman
is negotiating for additional pictures
from other universities.

The present schedule lists for
next week "The Romance of Rayon,"
"Lenox Pottery," and "De-Light."
The last named shows the history of
lighting, and the manufacture of

 

modern tungsten filament bulbs.

For the first week in next‘. month
Mr. Sherman has booked “Volm’s
Discovery” (storage batteries).
"Sugar Cane," "Bubhlesitht Soap
Industry," and “Industrious Dia—
moi-ids.” The last illustrates the use
of diamonds in drawing copper Wire..

The schedule for the second and‘
third weeks in February has “From-
Mine to Walk" (gypsum), “The
Story of Dynamite," "Silverware,"
and "The Story of Gasoline."

All showings are open to every.
one, and especially recommended for
chemistry students.
