No one knows where it started
for sure, but the predominantly
brunette population of Pine Tree
is no longer predominantly bru-

This much is passed by Hartr

just sort of oblivious to the
whole process.

The boys are stiLl reeling from
the shock of leariiig that peroxo

out. But judging by the interest
aroused there are indications or
a trend toward the lighter side
