within a week before the col—
lege was closed for vacation.
‘The Christmas tree wasn‘t seen
‘tlntll the night or the Formal
dinner. Now, the Yule Log din-
ner is held on Sunday, and be-
cause oi the shoit tinie’ before
vacation, the tree is up at that
time How-over. the lights are
not tinned on until just before
the formal dinnei.

Centeipicccs on the tables
will be large Christmas candles.
