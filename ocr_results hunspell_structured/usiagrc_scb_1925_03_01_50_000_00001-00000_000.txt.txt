The Nebraska cagcrs shot baskcts
from every angle and led from the
start to defeat Gl'illuell here last
night. as to 21.

The game was onc cf the host play—
ed herc this season and was close at
the end of the first half when the
Cornhuskers were barely leading 17
to 14. The rally which the Pioneers
had staged late in the first period did
not extend in to the second and the
Nebrasknns came back to gradually
pile up their lead.

Smnha. who was sent in as a substi-
tuoe in the second half was high scor—
er with eight points. just one more
than Ekstrom. Tipton and Moran
counted. Moran placed well in the
scoring column by caging five free
tosses and one field goal. There were
no outstanding performers tor the
Nebraska quintet as every man play—
ed a good floor game and at the

Cornhuslrers. captain Galvin turned

was the mainstay of the Pioneer team,
but none of his mates starred.

The game started off with a rush
when Ekstmm dropped in two baskets
before a minute was up. Tlpton then
counted a long one but the six point

The smrt of the second period was a
repetition of the first with nkstrhm
making a basket soon after the tip—
off. After two minutes' play he was
removed because of four personals
called against him but his successor
smaha was also adept at finding the
loop. The count stood 19 to 14 for
almost five minutes and than the Ne-

MRS. FLANAGAN WILL TALK

Every Girl in College to be included
in Social Aﬁnirs; Need Not
belong to Any Gmnp.

A combined businessknud social
meeting of all college women has been
called for Friday afternoon at four—
thirty in the Quadrangle drawing—
room. The proposed constitution of
the Tanager Guild Will be put‘ to a
vote at that time.

Preceding the business
short program will be given. Mrs.
Flanagan will speak, and there
will be instrumental music by Ruth
Norton at the piano and Julia Jensan
at the violin.

The proposed constitution, which

was first presented at a meeting of
the Guild held two weeks ago and
which is printed in this issue of the
Scarlet and.Blaok. is the joint work
of the recently elected council and the
temporary committee. '
The constitution provides for a uni-
fled social life for Gl-lnnell women
with as little red tape and climber-
some machinery as possible. One rep—
resentative from each section of the
Guild, with the president and secre-
tsryvtreasurer, form the only execut-
ive body. Sections are free to organ-
ize as they choose.

This flexibility is perhaps the out-
standing merit of the constitution. It
gives every opportunity and encour-
agement for continued and healthful
growth of the organization, something
which is bound to occur with succeed—
ing years. , ,

Another notable feature is 'that the
organization may be headed by a senr
icr or junior. This provision glves’
opportunity for early training in ere-
cutive duties and will make use of
material which might be unavailable
later. due to the number of positions
of responsibility which may be tilled
at the present time by seniors only.

The whole scheme of the Tanager
Guild is a most interesting experl<
meat and one that is unprecedented
in American colleges. if Grlnneil
succeeds here, she will have lived up
to her name, The Pioneer.
