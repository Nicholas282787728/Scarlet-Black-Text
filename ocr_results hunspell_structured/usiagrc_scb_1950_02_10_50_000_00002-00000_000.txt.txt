Get credit for learning to fly”! It may have once

sounded impossible, bllt things . e looking up.

Last mesday night at a meeting in the union, D
Stevens hatched an idea that he’s been Sitting on for a long
timeiflying lessons for students at a price they can af-
ford with college gym credits.

Here’s the scheme: If the college owned a few planes,
tlle airport business would be aided. Student pilots would
have a chance to continue their flying; other students could
learn; and while everyone is benefitting', Dr. Stevens would
continue to have a place for his plane.

It sounds grand and glorious. It looks like it would
make everybody happy. But the infant plan has many
hurdles, all of which amount to one thingémoney. Com-
mercial rates amount to $380. That includes the $10 a les—
son dual instructions, and the $7 an hour for the accumu-
lation of the 40 flying hours necessary for a license, Dr.

Stevens’ problem is to squeeze, juggle, and revamp the fig,

ures to the point that enough students could afford ﬂying
to get it up on a bisis comparable to the college arrange
ment with the Ross stables

Wings are sprouting on many would be birdmen already.
If the enthusiasm is not the fickle enthusiasm of perennial
“joiners” the plan may pull through. The real~nucleus is
the projected Flying Club, a group of licensed pilots. in the
student body. It is hoped they can provide the capital for
investing in three to five Piper Cubs, light, stable two-seat—
ers proved ideal as trainers. By owning planes, rental fees
would be eliminated, care could be taken so depreciation
would be minimal, thereby eliminating more of the opera—
tional costs. ‘ \

Another hitch in the plan remainsithe dollar for dol-
lar matching of student money with school funds. And that
is a big item. It is hoped the trustees u'lll_belleve it is im-
portant enough to keep students in time With our times to

take that step.

There’s much planning, pushing, and close figuring to

be done before the idea can become a reality. But it's in
the realm of possibility. It's certainly a progressrve step;
more power to the people who can pursue the plan to itsl

completition.

Pilk: km W Has Big—Plans;
/ Four-way Network Planned

And you‘ve heard it before but it fits here,

to Bob Pilkington.

One of the major changes be
ing contemplated is the setting
up of a network to include
Carleton,a Cornell, Beloit and
Grinnell and a breaking away
from the, Intercollegiate Broad-
casting System,

do,” Pilk said, “is broadcast

ing at Carleton, ior example,
KGRW listci-icrs would get the
Carleton announcer’s account of
thc game by direct telephone
Wire.

At the present time, only a
telephone summary immediately
after the game can be pre-
sented.

If the plans for this_inter-
conference network were to be»
come a reality, the stations
would probably exchange
mail transm tions and tape re»
cordings of interesting programs.

Another tentative plan is for
complete coverage of the stu—
dent council elections next
month ”like a blanket"

KGRW would like to allow
each candidate five minutes of
air time, and would like to get
an on»theVsp0t announcement of
the election results.

”All this, of course, is at the
discretion of the election com-
mittee,” Piik emphasized.

Among pther future plans he
listed arrangements for anoths
er quiz show, a ten-minute “fire
side chat” each week by Presiv

There must be a strong foun—

God, stated Rabbi Raab. We are
beginning to be cynical, even
the younger generation in our
civilized world. God is too vast
to understand and many of us
still have the childish notion
that God sits on a throne on
ihish to do our bidding. “God
,is not our messenger boy.” he
‘pxclaimed. We must realize that
God exists and operates through
natural and ethical laws. God
