 

Movies: a spoof, a miracle and Davis

By Nancy Carpenter

I’m trying to make these film
reviews less promotional and more
critical. But when the movies are
as exc ing as this week's movies
are, it’s difficult to write anything
other than “You gotta see this
one!”

Apparently, no critic has at
tempted to classify the unr
classiﬁable Rocky Horror Picture
Show (1975) and I haven’t seen the
ﬁlm myself. But rumor has it that
we are in for a bizarre time. This
is a current cult favorite all over
the country and. in some theatres.
audiences have dressed up in
costumes reminiscent of “sup-
pressed deslres” and thrown rice
during the wedding scene.

THE FILM Rocky Horror Pic-

ture Show has been closely adapted
from the show of the same name
and the cast remains largely the
same. The plot is outrageous. A
chaste young couple stumble into a
castle inhabited by peculiar types
from the planet Transylvania.
They meet Dr. Frank N. Furtert a
Frankenstein in rhinestone heels.
and his muscular transvestite
blond monster whose sexual apr
petites are assuaged by seducing
first the girl, then the boy. The film
spools the mad pmf movies of the
40’s, the beach party movies of the
50’s, and the sexually liberated
movies of the 60’s, Best of all, it’s a
musical with a hilarious rock
score, including a disco finale with
the entire cast.

The other weekend movie,

Casablanca (1943), is nothing short
of a miracle, considering the
lowness of its origins~an unin-
teresting play, a disparate cast
from every nationality, a studio
that originally signed Ronald
Reagan (l) to play Bogie’s role,
some campy dialogue (“Oh
Victor, please don’t go to the un-
derground meeting tonight! ") and
a North African set located in
Burbank, California. But the film
made movie history. This story of
the expatriate cafe owner and the
woman he once loved made
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman into public favorites.
Casablanca is concerned with
the reconciling of opposites:
comradeship and love, realism and
idealism, war and war resistance.

Ray to speak on campus

By Judy Pucker
Governor Robert Ray of lowa, by
invitation of the Grinnell College
Republicans and the PPPE
Committee, is planning to come to
the Grinnell campus sometime in
early February.

The month of February has been
set due to the governor's full
schedule. A precise date will
not be set for awhile due to a
governor's office policy not to
schedule events more than one
month in advance. Suggested
lecture topics, chosen by the
Grinnell Republicans and the
PPPE Committee. Will be sent to
the Des Moines office for cons
sideration.

GOVERNOR Ray is not only an
extremely wellrknown political
figure in lowa, but he is also of
national importance to the GOP,

WHEN increased supply lowers
international food prices poorer
nations do not suffer as much in the
short term. It is in the long term
that the low prices have serious
repercussions.

When food prices are low, poorer
nations can acquire adequate food
to feed their populations. The
lower prices, however, destroy the
production incentive for the far-
mers in these countries since they
can no longer maintain production
efficientlv.

ALTHOUGH poor nations are
able to acquire grain with relative
ease when the international grain
price is low, the distribution of this
grain within each country is often
inequitable. In many cases this
inequity is based on political
considerations. Distribution of food
oiten favors the urban population
at the cost of the rural and most
needy communities. By placating
the urban population with
adequate grain supplies, the
governments of many poorer
nations attempt to prevent unrest
which might serve to undermine
their regimes.

The growing problem oi
malnutrition is largely the product
of these grim population and
distribution scenarios, The UN
Food and Agriculture Organization
opened Its conference in Romelast
weekend by stating that ap»

This GROWING dependency,
Coupled with US domestic and

farm community also strongly
supports continued foreign sales in

not say a cut in the faculty budget

supports the continuation of the

Finally, it urges the President to
reconsider his policy to limit the
granting of tenure because it
clearly will harm rather than
strengthen the College.
