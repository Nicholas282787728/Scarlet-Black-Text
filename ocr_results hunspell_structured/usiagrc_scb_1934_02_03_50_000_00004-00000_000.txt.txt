Seven Ohio State
Students Expelled
in ROTC Dispute

(Simon! In The semlri and Blue’, ,1
COLUMBUS, 0.7m the face of
protests from ministerial groups
throughout the state, President
George \v. Rightniire has suspended
seven Ohio state university students
for their refusal to participate in
military training.

His action was taken arter ti‘us»
tees had left the decision in the
latest or numerous controversies
over compulsory military training
squarely in his hands. It won ac-
claim from the American Legion
post at Marion, Ohio, other organi-
zations of war veterans previously
endorsed his stand.

The immediate reacLion of the sus-
pended students was to stick to their
determination not to don the blue or
the R. o. T. 0. Their spokesman,
Charles Hart, who two years ago
won an excuse from drill on ‘consci-
entious objection" grounds, asserted
“We cannot return, because we can
not conscientiously take military
training.”

Dr, Rightmire lett a loophole
through which they may return to
their classes, promising that the
boys “would be automatically rein-
stated without prejudice whenever
they are willing to comply with the
university rule."

Jeanne Gabriel, ex-‘Sﬁ, who is now
attending Northwestern university,
will arrive in Grinnell Saturday
morning to spend the weekend as a
guest or Mary Martin.
