Students Helping the Homeless

Group's goal to

One day changes life-long attitudes

by John Ealer

Having always considered
myself somewhat of an idealist,
and feeling more than a little bit
guilty ahout the $14,000 my
parents were pouring into my
luxuriant existence at Grinnell
College. nty compulsion for
joining Students Helping the
Homeless was both altruistic and
selfish. I truly wanted to help
other people. but I also wanted to
mitigate a personal guilt. Luck—

along, helping oul a very worthy
cause.

Regardless of my motiva-
tions, I was still nervous about
going to the shelters for the first
time. But, with a friend, I made
plans to go during the week, and,
lo and behold, found myself
walking into the Forum that
Saturday morning at it am, I
didn‘t know what to expect. but I
had prepared myself for the worst.
Coming from New Jersey, im-
ages of huge, squalorous, city~run
shelters teeming with weathered
faces and grimy, tattered shells of
bodies ﬁlled my mind along wlth
some nagging questions like.
“What sort of mess have I gotten
myself into?"

That was just one of the top-
ics which ﬂirted with my cone
sciousness as I sat packed in a
Grinncl' College station wagon
on 1-80 west. i felt a little guilty
for regretting the loss of free time
that this adventure was going to

cost me, but I was able to write

Pilgrim said. A Syracuse
lawyer‘s association will provide
legal assistance to those who are
arrested. However, since coali-
tion protesters will divide
themselves into autonomous
“affinity groups" of five to 15
people who must reach a
consensus before taking any
rigid definition on the
organization’s structure. “We
hope to deﬁne ourselves through
what we do." said Hardin.
“There’s something offensive

activity. If you’re outraged about
Operation Rosette, do something.
You‘ve got to rat the red light

that sorrow off to the “greater
good" without too much tribula»
tion. I also couldn't help con-
templating the different types of
people that were jammed into me
car With me 1 wasn’t able to
make out any particular pattern of
ncrsonality, dress. or ideology; i
only felt the comforting notion
that everyone in the car shared a
common sense of compassion for
the truly needy in our society.
Our ' stay, Rufus tunes
house. , 'ed my first surprise.
The shelter was simply a con-
vertcdi o: renovated? house,
quite old and dilapidated, in which
a number of homeless men ate

down interior, along with the
spider web- and dineladen kitchen
didn’t shock me, as it probably
shocks others, since my grand
parents had lived voluntarily unv
dcr such conditions for many
years. What was a little more
difficult to handle was seeing the
homeless men themselves. How
can someone wearing Goreetcx
gloves even think of looking a
homeless man straight in the
eye? The incongruity of the
situation was disturbing, but I
welcomed it as a both humbling
and eyeropening experience in a
life whose focus always seems to
gravitate to “self."

The first people we truly
“met" were some of the staff of
Rufus Jones. They all belong to
the Kindred Community, lhc
group which runs Rufus Jones
House, the men’s shelter, and a
women’s shelter called

ASIA

"People confuse Chinese and
Japanese cultures a lot," said Ku-
mano. "There is one commercial
where the woman is supposed to
be Chinese but she is wearing a
kimono. It’s not that I have
anything against Chinese culture
but people just group us all
together. You have to realize that
there are differences and they are
important to the people in-
volved."

Takakawa stressed that ASIA
welcomes all students to its
meetings and its events. "ASIA

After touring Rulus lattes~
Sojourner Truth, and another
nearby shelter called the Catholic
Worker, we were ready to get
down to work, Some Grinncle
lians helped put down a floor in a
house the Catholic Worker was
renovating; others washed the
kitchen walls in Rufus loncs
house, A couple of hardy Grinv
nellians also took on the task of
identifying canned foods whose
labels had fallen off, As you can
sec, there is no distinct pattern to
the work Students Helping the
Homeless does in Des Moincsi
they simply do what needs to be
done.

After making significant
progress on the aforementioned
projects, it was time to head back
to Grinnell, I had worked up
quite a good appetite nailing
down boards that afternoon,
especially since I hadn't eaten
lunch, but after what I had seen
that day, calling myself hungry
would be quite an overstatcment.

Asian-Americans on the increase,
the planned symposium, and the
success of ASIA, Asian-Ameri-
cans are receiving overdue recog-
nition. Takakawa believes the
special qualities of Grinnell has
made this possible, "I don't want
to make this sound like an ad for
Grinnell but this school is really
open to change and it will admit
to past failures. It’s refreshing
that they [the administration] will

understand crises

in the spring of 1987,
homeless activist Mitch Snyder
spoke at Grinnell‘s Symposium
on Poverty and Homelessness in
America. During his speech he
challenged students to take action
against homelessness. The next
day a student motivated by Sny-
der’s speech contacted the Kindred
Community Shelters in Des
Motncs. Students Helping the
Homeless was founded and has

Homelessness has been an
cvcrrmcreasing problem in our
country and has grown into a crie
sis within the last eight years,
There are two to three million
people who are homeless in
America. Thirty percent of the
homeless population are families
with children, another 30 percent
are U.S. veterans, and a growtng
number are employed.

Students Helping the
Homeless cannot possibly make
a dramatic change in the condie
tions of homelessness in Des
Moincs. Our group believes that
change comes through knowledge
and that knowledge is gained
through direct experience. Our
group‘s priority is breaking down
stereotypes and preconceptions
about poverty and homelessness.
People who are homeless are of-
ten lumped togethcr into a class
of people who all have the same
characteristics. But for people
without homes, being homeless
is just one of their qualities.
People who are homeless vary in
age, race, sex. religion. and
background as much as anyone
else. Realizing these diverse
identities is fundamental to bely-
ing our misconceptions and

creating commonalities between
people of different economic
backgrounds.

Our group is not a service
oriented group. The results of
our work in Des Moincs are not
in “Saving the homeless" but
rather within ourselves—in our
attitudes and the personal rela-
tirinships we develop.

The Kindred Community
runs two shelters, one for women
and chil roll and one for single
men. Since 1981, federally as-
sisted housing has been cut front
332 billion to $7.17 billion.
This reduction in low»incomc
housing by more than 75 percent
is partly responsible for the na-
tionwide overcrowding of emer-
gency shelters like Kindred.

There is no easy solution to
the crisis of homelessness, but
when approaching the problem, a
distinction must be made between
temporary shelter and long-term
housing, and between practical
change in policies and social
change in attitudes. People need
immediate shelter tonight to stop
them from freezing in the night,
but the only long-term solution
to homelessness is affordable
low-income housing. For that
policy change to come about
changes will need to be made in
the ignorant and insensitive atti»
tudes of those in power (which
means those of us who vote, pay
taxes, and participate in the
American economy). Our group
realizes “a basic truth: we cannot
change what we do not under;
stand, nor, in turn, can we begin
to comprehend what we have
never seen” (Homelessness in
America).
