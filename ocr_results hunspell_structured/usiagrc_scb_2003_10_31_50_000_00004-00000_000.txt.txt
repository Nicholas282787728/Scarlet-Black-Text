Challenges of comfortable integration

Students say that the international community both supports them and segregates them from the wider student body

by Eva Constantaras

Grinnell College publishes shiny brochures depicting mixed
groups of international and American students strolling down the
loggia, students publish the GUM and accusations oiprejudite and
hate ﬂy.

“When things like the GUM open forum happened. the shit
started to hit the fan," said Erin Sinogba '06. “Things started to come
out and you wonder why people have such heated dialogue. You
realize a lot or things have been held back and a lot ofpcople don't
say things because they are so segregated."

The degree ofinteiuational student integration in Grinncll prob.
ably falls somewhere between the idealized depictions of total inte
gration and angry allegations lobbed by offended students. What
follows are the opinions ofeight international stue
dents on the subject ofintcriiarional integration
in Grinnellr

The international community

The international community is an impor-
tant source of support for its members as they
learn to navigate the experience of college in a
foreign country. International student Oncnmr
tion helps students get acquainted with each other
and the culture when they ﬁrst arrive and the
International student Organiaation (ISO) tries
tosolidiﬁes the community's bond. Although in-
ternational studenis relyon the community'ssup.
port to varying degrees, many acknowledge its
importance in their experience at Grinnell.

Cal-auv Gupta o7 knew that an international community was
something he wanted in a college. "I looked into [the international
community at Grinncll] before I tame here," he said. “That was one
of my criteria for choosing ilus place because there are people from
everywhere and the diversity is quite high in Grinnell "

For many, being around other international students provides a
sense ofcommon ground that an be hard to ﬁnd in a foreign cule

I think a lot of international students share this feeling,” said JP.

the same position [far from home in a foreign country)."

cant."

Orientation as a segregator

Although the international community serves as a source ofsup.
port and comfort for many otiis members, some international stu.
dents feel that International student Orientation contributes to the
isolation of the international community from the greater mmmue
niry. “After I went through [orientation] I realized it was very helpv
ful," said losh Mbitu ‘06, “but it really bunched [the international
students] together and even to this day we rend to bunth together."

MarieTan ‘05 agreed that the initial groups termed during ori-
entation tend to prevent international students from making the cf.
fort to establish friendships with American students oncc ihey arrive
on campus. “I dime here my ﬁrst year and made my friends during
ISO and thenI realired a litile bit too late the friends I could have
made during N50,” said Tan, “The [friendships] that I have now
that are not [With] international students took longer to for in. When
I beisinie an orientation assistant, I was like, ‘Don't go out and make
[hc same mistake that I did

Despite the advice oforientation organivcrs like Tan. many Sm-

"It probably shouldn’t
hurt me [when they
don’t know about my
culture] but I still feel
bad, like I am insigniﬁ-

dents who went through orientation this year still found it difﬁcult
to make friends outside olthe international community ”I feel like
the international kids really stuck together," said Ncha Govil ’07. “I
know a couple ofkids who really tried to branch out but it was
based on individual effort."

Cultural barriers

The bunching together phenomenon is asomewhat artificial one,
brought on by being in the minority in a foreign culture, said some
international students “One of the only things that international
students have in common is that they are not from America. They
are from everywhere else in the world When you put them in sun.
nell it is like “We are international,” Tun said. “I know of interna-
tional students who don‘t think ofthernselves
that way and think they aren’t any diffcrciii and
others think it's a part oftheii identity."

Feminine, the idea oFiui international com
munity didn’t become important until tinting
here and experiencing the separation between
international and domestic students. “I don’t
think [having an international community} was
cvcr really an issue for me. It didn’t even occur
to me that it is something I should consider."
said Ananta Tiwari '05. “I think after coming
here I have learned to see more visible markers
of segregation on the basis ofiaoe :lnd nationals

— Josh Mbltu ’06 W"

Many international students feel that nil.
tural differenoes make it dithtult for them to
approach and interact with Americin students.
"When I am with an American student I don’t feel like I can be as at
ease," said Ramos. “[International students) may think that the dif-
ferences are too large that its not worth it to make the effort to be
friends with them, and maybe I share this [lintudcln

Mbitu agreed. “1 round breaking into air American group or
friends takes a lot," said Mbitu. “It’s very hard I tried chilling out
with American guys, but I really didn’t understand them."

These cultural drifeicnccs lead some international students to
tear being roietted by the larger community. “The fear is prevalent
that they aren’t going to be accepted by the general Grinnell culture,"
sinogba said.

Some international students suspect that domestic studenu are
also intimidated by these same cultural differences, adding to the
division between the two group; “I think part oiit is that [American
students] are afraid ofdoing something wrong," said Sinogha. “I think
thtmindsetis thatifAmeiicans display theirAmeiitantultuie around
international students then [the internationals] aren’t going to tin.
derstand so they choose not to talk to them at all."

Mbitu siispecis that some domestic students may not only fear
displaying their own culture but also fear that they are too ignorant
ofthe iirterimtional student's culture “I know for sure a big portion
ofthem don't know about [our cultures] and maybe that keeps ihem
fiorn interacting with us. ii is about not hui-iingsomcone's feelings"

aid Mbitu. “Ityou are brought up and taught to respect people, it

can he a problem.” Mbitu thinks that these fears a ~ understandable.
“It probably shouldn't hurt me [when they don't know about my
culture] but Ian feel bad, like I am insignificant, Maybctliatiswliar
keeps them away"

According to Govil, some domestic students are also intimidated

by the community that international students have already formed
before the rest ofthe studenis arrive, “I have talked to Amerian kids
and they haw: told me that they are a little intimidated by interna—
tional kids because they all hang out in a huge group and they all
seem to know each other beiore the American kids get here." she
said. She thinks that as soon u both sides get past their mutual ticpi.
drama of cultural differences there are very few barriers left to form.
ing friendships, despite cultural differences,

Solutions

Many international students also feel that international and do»
mestie studenis tend to be lazy and reluctant when it comes to going
outside their groups oftriends. “I know there are quite a few [inter—
national stiidenisl who just stay in their own little bubble and nut
lung out with each other," said Sinogba. “But I think it is their own
doing and they didn’t make an effort to make their presence part of
the Crime” culture."

Mbltu isn't sure if all of the laziness needs to be muniei—acted.
“There really is not a very big incentive to go out and make Amerie
tau friends just so that you can improve crinncll," said Mbitu. “You
just do what is convenient."

Ramos agreed that it takes a concerted effort. “Both sides could
be lazy about making the eﬁ‘ort to mach out to another culture.” he
said. “I still have a problem with approaching American studenu.
For me it does take an errort, but I think I am learning and am trying
to meet dam and get to know who iey are as a person and not as an
Ametlcan or an international student and I think that really helps."

In order to prevent the segregation between American and inter
national students, many international studenis suggested modifying
orientation and the.Inteinational student organication. Tan sug»
gcsted that more International Student Orientation and New Stu-
dent Orientation activities should bejoinedt “There are things that
we have in common as new collcgcstudents," said Tan. “Those things
should be incorporated into N50."

Others felt orientation should be shortened and most social ae-
tivitics combined with N50 and that the two orientations should
overlap. At the very least. all the early orientations should be come
bined so there isa more diverse pool ofstudents. According toSinogba,
these strategies would help ensure that friendships between interna.
tional students can develop without removing the incentive for int
ternational students to make friends with American students.

To reinforce friendships with Americanstuclents, Govil suggested
emphasiaing the open membership ofthe International student oi.
ganiaation. “I don’t thiiikArnericarr kids realize that they on be part
of ISO. They think it's purely for international students." she said.
“Maybe they can publicize more that American kids are invited to
join [50. lflSO were that diverse that would be really helpful be»
cause then Amerimn kids would realize what international kids are
going through as well and then they might be able to relate to its
better."

The international studenu who were interviewed agreed that in»
tegiation can’t and shouldn't be forced because it IS an individual
choioe. The extent to which the two groups, or any groups, integrate
is up to the individual. “I think it depends on thc international stu-
dent," Ramos said. “I think some people are very sensitive to the fact
that they are in the minority and then there is a barrier, but iithey
aren’t then there isn’t."

“It's all about individual choices," Tan saidi
