TWD HEDITALS ARE GIVEN

Piano Concert by iiiugucrite Kills]
lllltl Reclml by Prof. Selleve’s
Students Are Presented.

Inter sting programs were pr
sented in the two School of Music re-
citals given this Week. Marguerite
Kahl, assisted by Leo Underwood,
tenor, gave a recital Wednesday after-
noon, and a program of compositions
was presented Thursday afternoon by
Professor Scheve‘s class.

The ﬁrst number in the Wednesday
recital, 3. Beethoven Sonata, op. 31,
N0. 2, displayed Miss Kahl’s excellent
technique in the brilliant passages.
The Scherzo in B ﬂat minor, by
Chopin, showed the player's ability to
handle such a heavy and difﬁcult se-
Iection

Caprice and Love Song from “Five
Aquareilen,” by Prof. Schcvc, were
given a. delightful interpretation The
Caprice, especially, with its dance like
rhythm, Wits EL general favorite. Both
selections of the suite were character-
istic of the Cnmnosel‘.

The two thoroughly modern num—
bers, “Reverie," by De Bussy, and
"Lotusland," by Scott, were equally
well given. Miss Kahl is the pupil of
Prot. Scheve.

Mr. Underwood sang (our songs
from the cycle "SIiIand." His voice
was clear and his tones well placed.
He brought out very well the dirterent
moods of the various songs.

in the recital Thursday afternoon, a
praeludidm by Lorna Palmer was tull
or modern rhythms. It was played by
the composer.

“When Spring Comes Home," by
Nellie Keister ,was a melodious little
lyric. Two songs by Wayne Richards.
"Night Song 02 Anialii" and "Bob
White." showed the composer's ability
to write accompaniments. This group
was sung by Margery Warner.

The charming group of two Spring
songs and a Lullaby by Mabel Blair
Macy were sung delightfully by Miss
Warner. The three songs were hill of
gracctul and fanciiul moods.

Violin solos by Miss Macy, Miss
Keister and Mr. Richards were played
by Mr. Peck.

Three piano selections wcr p c»
sentcd by h 'ss rpairncr. The two w t-
tcu by Miss Keister were melodious
and full or sun
Mcnuctte by Ml Richards with its
(111“chin duality had a more vigor»
nus harmony.

The last number was a piano selcce
tion by Mrs. Macy called "Imlil'ommii "
It was shown at its host as intel'nrer
ted by Mrs, Lyman.

IIIIIDNS AND RADISHES PIANIED

First Sprouts Anxiously Awaited by
Qlinili'mlgle Gardeners.

With ground tilled and bar-rowed
and the onions and radishcs planted,
the girls are anxiously awaiting the
appearance or the ﬁrst grccn sprout in
the garden just north of the Quad—
rangle. With rret. Collard as cap-
tain, the girls march briskly torth,
armed with rakes and hoes, ready to
ﬁght the weed. 0n the return march
trom the garden their steps are not
so light: this may be due to their
mud laden shoes or fatigue—it is
deemed best not to say.

This work is under the W. A. A. der
pal‘tment, and is by tar the most popu-
lar activity this spring. Its popularity
will probably increase still more when
vegetables raised by the tair garden-
ers appear on the Quadrangle tables.
