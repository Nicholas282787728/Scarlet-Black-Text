WEDNESDAY,

RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

By Cliirk Smith
We got ciirioiis the other day
and decided to find out just what
was being done about the need
for a new fieldhouse or gym-
nasium. For three years we‘d
heard a lot of crazy rumors about
“construction beginning at once,"
etc., and were getting tired of it.
What we wanted were honest to
goodness facts on the real situa-
tion, so it seemed that John c.
Truesdale, athletic director, would
most likely have the answers to
our questions.
V I 3 3
lI‘he ﬁrst question we asked
him was. “Does the athletic de-
partment or the administration
have any DEFINITE plan in
progress now which will bring
about construction of an athletic
plant within the next five years?"
c . x
The answer was “no.” sevenil
years ago the college tried to get
the city to receive government
money for construction of a field
house to he used by the high
school, also. This was the only
way the college could get govern-
ment help because it was a pri-
vately endowed institution. The
city retused to contract any debt,
so any hope of Pioneer officials
for aid from that source was
shattered. Even Harry Hopkins,
our distinguished New Deal alumv
nus, couldn't change the situa-
tion.
a s i
since then, nothing has been
done, and at present the outlook
is none too bright for the future.
Financially, the college is in no
condition to contract a debt for
construction of the much desired
building. They see the trouble
such ventures on the part of
other neighboring colleges has
caused them and have no desire
tor a taste of the same. It would
take $250,000 to build a good
fieldhouse. and another $100,000
for an endowment tor the upkeep
at the building.

Finally, we asked just what can
he done, if such is the situation?
The answer was that only time
could tell. The alumni realize the
need but are poor, just like the
rest of us. President Nollen has
a fieldhouse down as the first
item on his list of "musts" in
regard to general campus
provement. If prosperity ever re-
turns and a few loyal millions
aires show up by the centennial
in 1946. we might have a field—
house.
