Tenrthirty in the morning seems like
a reasonable time (or an interview.
Even the {act that the person being in
tervlewed is sitting down to breakfast is
justiﬁable 7 let's iaet it, some people
just aren't early risers. But when you
conduct an interview at 10:303.m and
the person that you are interviewing is
just getting ready to go to bed, well.
that‘s a diiterent story altogether.

William Hansen, the r ' l name at
Grinnell's "bakery man," was getting
ready to hit the sack after working all
night at the Danish Maid Bakery, home
oi the iniamous bakery run, The bakery
run is, oi course, one oi the special
things college students at Grinn‘ell can
take part in that makes living here

The’oiie thing that is certain iihcn you
ovin a bakery is that in order to pl'OV e
iresh baked goods lor the customers in

at midnight and heads donn to the
