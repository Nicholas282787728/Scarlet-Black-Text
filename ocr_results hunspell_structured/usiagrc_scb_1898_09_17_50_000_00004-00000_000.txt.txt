ry evening about cighr
teen or nineteen men appeared
for football practice. Thursday
evening there were on the ﬁeld
twentyrthree men by actual cnunt.
Thus has the football season
opened at Gtinncll.

For the information of the
alumni and friends ol the college
outside Grinnell it may be well
to make a brief statcmcnt of the
outlook. It has not been custo~
many for Iowa Collcgc to have
ﬂuttering prospects at the open-
ingof the season and this fall is
no exception. No matter what
the material on hand, little can be
done without substantial opposir
tion. Two teams cannot be propr
erly made up from twentyrfour or
twenty-ﬁve men. There should
be on the side lines ready to sup
ply vacancies at least eight or ten
players, It is hoped, howevcl,
that by the opening of next week
there will be a larger number of
candidates.

There are ﬁve vacancies on the
team, caused by the retirement
or graduation cl tht: following
men: Coggeshall, Fellows, Hart,
Gray and Norris. lt is probable
that part of these can be ﬁlled
with new material while some of
last year's substitutes will doubtr
less make the team by proper
\VOrlC. 0t course nothing can be
predicted before the men have
lined up as to who will be
the successful candidates. For
the beneﬁt of all concerned it
may be stated that the personnel
of the team will be pretty deﬁnir
tely known about Nov. r. Much
ct tht: new matcfiulgives promise,
but it is, as usual, of the feather
weight variety. Men of beef. apr
pal‘ently. are getting: scarccr at
Grinnell every year.

 

The loss of Captain Coggcshall
at left will be largely Compensated
by his work in the capacity of
coach. He may be fairly called
the best football captain Grinnell
cvci bad. There is every reason
to believe he will prove of great
service as a coach. He has the
faculty oi infusing snap into the
playandhavingbeen underPrinco
ton coaching for three years is
thoroughly acquainted with the
details of the system,

A word regarding the support
oflhe team. Interest of the stu-
dent body will always be a factor
in athletics. The success ufevery
college team is. in large measure.
dependent upon it. Very desir-
able. indeed, is tlie substantial inr
tercst shown by attendance at
games. It is not only a ﬁnancial
beneﬁt but often has a marked et-
fect upon the result of the game.
If, however. there are those who
dcsile to show a valuable interest
in football but who cannot afford
to contribute much in a ﬁnancial
way they can do agrcat good by
rubbing the candidates down each
evening. With all its vaunted
patriotism and loyalty Grinnell
has over been lax in this respect.
It IS not saying too much to re-
mark that an opportunity is now
presented along this line to do

good not only for football but for
the college.

The schedule, which has been
admirably arranged by Manager
Spaulding, has met the approval
of the athletic committee and the
faculty. From a ﬁnancial stand-
pointtoo it promises to be sucr
cesstul.

#Wﬁ.

The track men were out tor the
ﬁrst time Friday evening and
took light work. During the
coming week it is hoped that all
old men and many of the new
students will be out. each after
noon at 4:15.
