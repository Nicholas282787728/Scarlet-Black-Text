The Rise & Fall of Gn'nnell

S&B Staff Editorial by Tom Zlabinger

 

 

Grinnell was in the middle of Iowa, the college made it a

tradition to bring some of the greatest speakers and musicians
here. Jeﬂ‘erron Airplane, Jose Luis Borges, Louis Armstrong, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., Howling Wolf, Ali AkbarKhan, WeatherReporl, Herbie
Hancock, Bruce Springsteen, The Violent Femmer and Soul Asylum are
just a few—and it was through this ﬁrst-hand exposure to greatness that
provided the sparks that ignited the brains of Grinnell students. These
fantastic performers and speakers inspired them.

But on November 25, 1985, US News and World Report recognized
Grinnell Collegeasoneof the top ten liberalartscolleges in the nation.This
honor broughta plague of tension upon Grinnell, Since then, Grinnell has
been pressured to be one of the top liberal arts colleges. As a result of
catering to this image, all of Grinnell‘s original character is being Stripped.

There needs to be more to college life than just academics, but the
administration is blind to this. In order to conform to federal alcohol
laws so the college wouldnotlose federal funding,Hector'.t was closed:
So more students would use the “beautiful“ Han‘is Center after the
college spent so much money on it, Gardner was closed. The closing of
Gardner and Hectar'r sent out a message of distrust from the adminis-
tration, Every allrcampus event is monitored as it goes on at the Harris
Centeriit is intimidating; It‘s huge! The Harris Center will never be a
popular place because it is unsuitible for college parties. Harris is a cross
between a high school gymnasium and a hospital.

Weareoutraged. This is horrible. In thepursuitof a “greater Grinnell,"
Grinnell‘s very strengths are being whacked away. Students are becoming
frustrated because there is no environment where they can socializeiand
instead of meeting the people of the world. we are only reading about them.
Hardly anyone of the caliber of Martin Luther King or Louis Armstrong
comes to Grinncll anymore. It would be like Eric Clapton, Spike Lee or
Ross Perotcomln g today. Instead we gethrthubt‘a/t & Eleanor Smcal.

The closing ofHecIor'r and Gardner is whathas asphyxiatcd this
campus. There may still be some individual sparks of creativity. but
those will also soon die if this plague of tension is not lifted.

A hard reality must be cradled in a soft dream. Our academics and
reputation are not being surrounded by anything fantastic anymore. No
one realizes that prcrl985 Grinnell is what made this college one of the
best liberal ans schools in America. By stripping Grinnell’s character
and energy away. we will have nothing to be proud of. Soon we will be
booted out ofthe USNewr and Worldchorr it we do not put back into
Grinnell what got us there in the first place.

YEARS ago, Grinnell College was in tune with the world. Because

dent/hall council system is a
perfect example; it is an utter farce.

Trustees can say that they meet
with students. Sure, they meet with
Student Government Association
(SGA) representatives, but SGA has
been ineffective in representing and
moblizing student concerns.

Trustees have had chances to in-
teract with the tank and ﬁle students,
but they don’t seem interested. last
year, when students wished to meet
with trustees to talk aboutthepresstng
student issues of security and the re

they insulate themselves from the cur~

board's detachment.

Through their actions, the trusty

themselves. They are becoming

thought of as “the enemy." They are
perceived, rightly or wrongly, as old
white men with lots of dough whocare
only about the endowment. This lack
of student contact with the trustees
creates more than just an ugly image.
It reduces the ability of the board to be
an effective decision making body.
Look atsome of the decisions that they
have made: They approved the Harris
Center, in an effort to rid the world of
college guldebooksthdllrumpett‘d our
lack of a student center. The Harris
Center planning process should have
been open to all students’ input. It
would have been an effective butldr
ing,and would haveconu‘ibutcd much
more than it docs today,

The trustees gave their nod to the
3-2 program, but refused to hire a

up for theresultinglossofclassesinall

been hired because of the 3-2 program,
and the furor in the Theatre Depart-
ment is a direct student reaction to the
trustees’ half-hearted followrthrough
on this policy change.

Discriminatory legislation
reﬂects society’s attitudes

By Amy Neevel

H, SURE; gays have rights

“You Want guys to have

rights? Do you really want them to
corrupt your children?"

Although sentiments like these
are not commonly heard at Grtnitell
College, beliefs such as these are
prevalent in American society and
are reﬂected in our nation’s laws,
Due to Grinncll's unique environr
mentwc are somewhatshcllcred from
ovcrtly prejudiced attitudes and the

effects of these laws on gay, lesbian,
and bisexual people. There are three
categories of legislation concerning
GLE citizens: sodomy laws,pro-dis»
crimination laws, and anti-discrimi~
nation laws.

Currently 25 states and the Dis—
trict of Columbia have laws regulate
ing private sexual activities between
consenting adults. Although dcfint—
tions of sodomy differ slightly from
state to state, the general view is that
sodomy isdefincdtts omlstimulntton

states with sodomy laws apply to
