Field hockey ends successful season

by Sarah Brichford

Those who spent their fall break
in Grinnell were able to witness
exciting field hockey action while
the Pioneers hosted the State
tournament. For two days Six Iowa
teams battled for glory on Mac and
Ward Fields.

The University of Iowa swept all
five of their games on the way to a
first place finish. Graceland beat
Grinnell to capture second, The
Pioneers finished third and Luther
settled into fourth, UNI tied with
lowa Wesleyan for fifth place, ,

PIDNEER WlNS Came over
Iowa Wesleyan 270, Luther H‘ and
UNI Z-l. Cnscaptain Harriet
Phinney scored once, freshman
Sonja Balstad three times and co

captain Lisa Bowers once in the
three Grinnell victories,

The Pioneers fell 0-2 to a strong
University of Iowa team and in the
final game, Graceland handed
Grinnell 3 1-0 defeat which was
tough to swallow. Grin ll had
hoped for a Second place finish and
a chance to demonstrate their
prowess at regionals. The loss to
Graceland left the Pioneers in
third place and brought an abrupt
end to their season.

REFERRING T0 the Graceland
contest, co~captain Harriet
Phinney expressed despair.
“We‘ve beaten them before and I
think our skills are better. We had

so many opportunities to score,” ’

Coach CindyWinklersummed up
Grinnell’s tournament play. “I
certainly Wasn’t displeased with
our performance. We played some
excellent hockey. It's simply the
nature of the game that you can
lose by score when actually you've
won by superior play."

The '79 Pioneers enjoyed their
‘most successful season in the brief
history of the team mainly, says
Coach Winkler, because of student
participation. Said Winkler, “We
are capable at Grinnell of having a
‘winning tradition despite the
prevalent attitude that you can‘t
win which some people have."
