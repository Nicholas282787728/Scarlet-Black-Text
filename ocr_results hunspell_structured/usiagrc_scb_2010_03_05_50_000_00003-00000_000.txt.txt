“Grinncll is an abnoiinalil’y among its peers wrth not having
its own mental health and counseling center," said Joyce Stern
’91,Dean tor Academic support and Advismg.

Vice President for Student Affairs Houston Donghnty be—
lieves that the College's students need additional mental health
support.

“Our students deserve the best we can give them," said
Dougharty. ”That is especially true for mental health We have a
lot orcntching up to do,"

In order to “catch up,” Student Affairs tletided to form the
Student Counseling and Health Transition Advisory Commit
tee. The committee consists of faculty and stuff, as well as two
student tepreseumtrves~ACE Chair Mairead O’Gtiitly’lO and
Active Minds participant Chiis lclildcbrand'lo,

Three additional students will also be involved in the hiring
process of the staffinembers for the new College Mental Health

'12, Andrea Leiser'll and Colin Wee ’lZ—are an essential part
in the process.

“Student importance has been critical," Dougharty said. “it
makes sure we make the right choices,"

Strident participation in the restructuring process shows that
the need for an on-campus mental health center definitely etis .

“i am very passionate about mental health,” Leiser sai .“I
want to help making the center as successful as possible."

Wee agrees that the permanent psychologist position is a
great idea,

“I am interested in implementing the new College Health
Services and hope to make it more approachable for snidemsi
especially internationals,” Wee said.

Students, starrand faculty have high hopes concerning the
new counsehng center.

"1 am really looking forward to having a colleague in coun-
seling," stern said. “Having a mental health care provider as part
of the campus community will enable us to reach out to more
students and student groups.”

As far :is the hiring process for the Lead Psychologist goes,
choices have been narrowed down to the top three candidatesi
Tom Berry, Ph.D,, Jesus Atos, PhD and Harriet Dickeyrcha-
sins Ph.D.’82.

All three candidates for the Lead Psychologist position have
visited the campus for an open QatA session during the past
week. The position is expected to be ﬁlled as soon as interviews
are done, sometime during mid—Match.

“we need to get the Lead Psychologist hired, so [that] we
can hire the staff psychologist," Stern said. "We need them to be
able to work together,"

Despite having scheduled walk-in counseling ses-
sions on campus, the Health Center seeks to maintain
a strong relationship with the Poweshiek Center Merit
ml Health Center for afterhout emergencies. as well as
for longrterm therapy that some students may be seeking

“Ofcourse students can still opt to see someone oﬁrcampus,"
said Stem,

The exact structures of the new mental health center are
not laid out yet, as they will depend on who is chosen for Lead
Psychologist and Director. Hopefully with these new positions,
there will be more options for campus counsehng and the Cole
lege’s atmosphere of stress will be reduced

Gender neutral housing grows

All sides of campus to have gender neutral housing

BY MATT BaCiiTci l

With the approach of room draw, Crinnell students are
eagerly discussing their living options for next year. How—
ever, some changes have been made to the process of gene
dcr neutral housing, in ordei to better accommodate the
needs or rho gender ncurrul community on campus, The
changes were enacted rn response to the emerging chub
lonpes wulun tht tum it hous in etup.

“Gentle neutral ho is really fui‘rilliincntal, illl(l

an SA in Younkei North,

This )eal‘,gcndcr ucutrai he w l include the language
houses, wson Hull and the i\Ii Co-ops, increasing the
number of potentially gender neutral beds on Campus by
30. Additionally, two floors—vCowles lst and Lil’ er 1&7
were declared gender neutral since each floor contains one
bathroom apiece.

Younker North will no longer be gender neutral, which
was seen us no longer viable due to the number ofstutlents
who request to live there.

“The idea was we wunt[ed] to develop with gender
neutral housing an intentional gender neutral community,"
said Vice President of Student Affairs (VPSA) Ben Of-
fenbeig ‘11, “Thitjust couldn't happen in Younker because

Alongsrde the housing reform, Student Affairs is add»

better equipped to deal with the social dynamics, activism
and programming that student leaders may face while liv-
ing in gender neutral housing.

“This also I think is reﬂective of the commitment to
ensure that the student staff members in both gender neur

to select that ahead of time,” said Director of Residence

More construction to come

BY EM [LY Blunt

This past Wednesday night, Janette Blackburn, a
Principal at the Shcpley Btilf‘rnch Richardson 8e Abbott
Architecture Firm, discussed a possible update to the
college's master layout plan of the buildings around
camptrs with faculty and students. r

The talk provided the audience with ftirthe
updates on the master layout plan, created 10 years ago.
Considerations involving Burling Library, built more than
50 years ago, were reviewed. Blackburn suggested that and
some other buildings are in need of a renovation to better
meet the needs of current student life,

“A lot has been accomplished at the College over
these 10 years in terms of what that master plan deﬁned,
including completion ofthc [Joe Rosenneld Center
and] completion of the science center—but a lot of
things weren‘t done, and it’s time for the master plan
to be updated again," said Grinnell College Librarian
Richard Fyffe. “One of the things that wasn't done was a

building or a completely new structure would best ﬁt into
student life at Grinnell,

“For,..librarios like Burling that were designed
before the library was the single place you went to get
information, they need to have some different kind of
purpose, some different reason to go there," Blackburn
said. “I'm talking about teaching that can really beneﬁt
from being in a library setting whether it’s because they‘re
using materials from a special collection or whether it’s
because they're using sophisticated technology and the
library’s the place that supports that Those places that
have collaborated in this way have been really successful
in terms of adding vitality to the library and making it a
central place again,"

However, according to Blackburn, for any such
renovation done to Burling or other buildings on
campus to work, defining what the library means for
Grinneil College and how it ﬁts into campus life must be
considered when planning things out.

Blackbiirn,_AIA, LEED AP, has been the lead
architect and planner on over 30 higher education and
library projects around the nation. Her clients have
included colleges such as Colorado College, Occidental
College, Amherst College, as well as larger institutions
such as Duke, Columbia and Princeton During her
presentation, she discussed architectural trends in
institutions over the past 20 years, indicating which
projects have been the most successful and why.
‘Collaborating the information commons, bringing
computing and library spaces together, some social space
like a cafe—this idea of active study space—that essential
idea has expanded and changed in many different ways,"
Blackburn said. “The library is not always this noisy
active media consensus place, but it’s also this place where
students have access to all these different resources and
support mechanisms but can also do very focused study.”
Blackburn focused on the trend of collaborating
different programs and creating multi-pur ose spaces
in one central location, similar to how theﬁkc works.
However, the aim of the talk was largely geared towards
Burling Library and how either a large renovation to the

the faculty as well,” Blackburn said “The idea of what is
common and really...undetstanding [that is].rris the most
important piece, because 1 think you can throw a lot of
functions together and if they are not all really Connected
in a bigger cohesive plan for how the academic programs
are delivered they're just occupying space next to each
others” '

SGA'Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA)
Joanna DeMats ’10, who attended the discussion, agrees ’
with the advice given by Blackburn and believes that
collaboration between different programs on campus in
the library should be considered in possible renovations.

“I know in conversations with different academic
resource centers like the writing lab, the reading lab, ITS
and academic advising we’ve had a lot of discussions
about their proximity to the library and maybe it is a good
idea for someone in the writing lab to have ornce hours
in Burling," DeMats said. “Blackburn knows what trends
there are and what people are talking about, she also
knows how well they've worked out at: other places” .it's
good to have her perspective.w
