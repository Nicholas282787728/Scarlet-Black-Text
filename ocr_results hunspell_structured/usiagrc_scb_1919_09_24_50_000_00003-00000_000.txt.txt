GET MANY GOATS

DeHahn and McCornack Start
§ Goat Kai ng Enterprise,

A. B. Dellanu, '06, and F. A. McCor-
naek, e. '93, have launched the largest
goat breediirg enterprise ever attempt:
ed in the United States. Mr. Deilaan
is now in Switzerland where he is
purchasing zoo or the best thorough—
bred Swiss goats. He hopes to sail
with them from France the early part
of October. Owing to the U. s. gov-
ernment regulations the goats must
be held in quarantine lor six months
belore they can be shipped into this
country. so Mr. DeHaan is taking the
herd to Martinique, an island in the
West indies, lor this sojourn. He has
three native: Swiss herdsmen to help
him in the handling oi the goals.

«Upon entering this country the goals
will he taken direct to a farm near-
Sioux City where a permanent goats
raising industry is to be established.
This enterprise has the sanction and
help of the U. S. Department or Agri-
culture.

There is a big demand throughout
the country for goat’s milk ior ima~
lids and babies, because it can be ii
gested so much more easily than cow's
milk. However, these men will not
tackle the dairy business but will cori-
ﬁne themselves to the raising oi the
goats. Goalsl‘nising business has
never been under-taken on so large a
scale in this country beiore. One or
the reasons is the inconvenience and
expense or the long quarantine period.

Mr. DeHaan, who has been very ac-
tive in Grinnell-in-China, had his ﬁrst
experience with goats as a commercial
proposition, while in China. Since hi
return to this country he has exper-
merited further along the same line.
While in a bank at Laurel. Nebl'., he
kept seine goats in his back yard and
was very successful with them.

With Mr. DeHaan’s experience and
faith in the goat industry the above
partnership was lormed. and its tie~
velopmcnt will be watched by inte
ested people all over the country.
