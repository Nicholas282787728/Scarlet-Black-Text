‘Slide-Rlule Sage’
Develops More Theories

Madison, Wi . (AcPliThe Uni

to cover a barn, is making his rule

Aldro Lingard has discovered
that the university heating plant

it students smoked in the build

ing.) Ninetyrone per cent of the
heat value would come from cig-
arets and the remainder fro’m
pipes.

Doing some more serious “slid
ing," Aldro iound that Badgerites
spend $241,000 tor cigarettes and
$9,500 for pipe tobacco at year.

“Most people,n he said, “take
about 12 puffs per cigarette, and
the average volume of a puff is
about .2 cubic inches. In one year
the student body inhales about
63,000 cubic feet of smoke.
smokers take in another 120,000
cubic feet. This is the volume of
a room 60 feet square and 18 feet
high.

“The energy content of all the
tobacco is about 150.000.000.000,-

chanical energy 100 per cent, there
would be 465 foot pounds of it,
