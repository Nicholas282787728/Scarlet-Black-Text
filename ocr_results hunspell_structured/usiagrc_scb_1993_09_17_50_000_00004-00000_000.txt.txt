I of the finest, most exclling bands in America
isscheduled to put on d genutneska show. The
Toasters are part of the foundation of the American
Ska scene. Theirenthusiasm, skill, and longevity as a
Ska band has helped to propagate the New York Ska
scene and keep Ska alive around the world. Nearly 14
years after the Specials released Frce Nelson Mandela
to 2t Ska hungry England, the contagious and infective
energy ofSkzt music has been carried around the world

and now is set to liven the Htu-rls Center. The HZIIHS
Center will reverbernte With the powerful horns ofthe
Toasters, will pulsate, jump, and explode with the
ebullient rhythms and peppy guitar, and Will shake
with the pitlcr patter of little boots Stompin' and
skankin‘ away. The Toasters successfully combine
primal Jamaican Ska rhythms with the energy of the
New York underground scene to produce one of the
most energetic shows imaginable. For real dancing
and a window into the Ska subculture, come to the
Harris center and be prepared to dance, skunk, and
soak in the energy of the Toasters.
