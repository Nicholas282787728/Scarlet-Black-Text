slcarcr.l<irrrrcy is my favorite Friday afternoon band.

Every week, i ﬁnish my classes and rum in my p3-
pcrs and meet my deadlines and stumble home ro be
ronowod, i put away the sad hasrard music rhar gcrs me
through the week and the angsry music rhar gcrs me
through the night, and pur in somcrhing rhar makes
in: feel betterimaybc even feroclously good.

Recently (since it more our a f:w months ago), I’ve
gcrring rny dosc or rorociousiy good rock from their
newest CD, On: Brat. It’s loud, and up but and inter-
esllng and’onginal. and that’s hard to ﬁnd all in one
album these days. It’s also one of those albums that
doesn’r get old as you listen to it more and more, it gets
newer. You know what I mean?

Now {or a shorr history lesson: Sicarcrkinncy was
started in 1994 by guirnrisrs and singers Cnrrlc
Brownsrein and Colin Tucker
in Olympia, wish. They wcnr
rhrough z couple ofdrun-lmcrs
(scrrlirig on Janerwcrss) and a
couple orrecord lahcis isorrling
on Kill RockSrars). They’ve re»
[Eastd xix albums over the
years, and rourdd d lor, and
have managed to be ended
