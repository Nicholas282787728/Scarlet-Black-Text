India is
hocked by

assassination

of Gandhi

The Inle Indira Gandhi.

by Sanjay Khanna

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s
brutal assassination confirmed as
the doing of her personal Sikh
security men, has lett many peo»
ple all over the world shocked and
appauled. While world leaders
contemplate the stability or lack
of it in the subcontinent under the
succession of her son Raiiv Gan-
dhi, it would not be wrong to
assert that most Indians, in-
cluding her adversaries and
enemies. mourn her death with a
sense of personal loss,

At home. Ms. Gandhi crisss

hissed the nation’s villages in a
Kudi Sari (cotton and hand-
woven dress), and this was
recognized as her proximity to the
masses On the international
front, Gandhi wore the best of silk,
and played off the super-powers in
her efforts to consolidate India’s
position as a major non-aligned
power in East Asia. Gandhi’s
death is the loss of a shrewd.
dynamic and aristocratic leader
that India will mourn for years to
come.

BRIEF HISTORY

Indira Gandhi was the daughter of
India’s first Prime Minister, Pan-

dit Jawahar Lal Nehru. She was
educated at the Vlshwabharati
University in India, andatOxford
University in Britian.

Gandhi’s political background,
rearing in the field a strong me
terest ili politics, saw her as the
Minister for Information and
Broadcasting from IBM until 1966.
She was later (first) sworn in as
Prime Minister in 1966, and was
re-elected for a second term in of-
{ice which lasted until 1977. As

,Prime Minis r, Gandhi held posi-

tions as Additional Charge for the
Ministry of External Altairs
(1967459). Finance (1969-70),
Home AffalTS (1970773) and Inior-
mation and Broadcasting
(1971-75). She was also elected as
The Cast Chairperson of the Non»
aligned Nation's in 1982

In 1975 she declared an
emergency in the country, permit-
ted by the Indian Constitution.
During this time suspected smug-
glers and antisocial elements
were arrested and detained for a
period or two years without trial
under the Maintainance of the ln-
ternal Security Act. Radical
religious factions and labor unions
were banned. and for the first
time since India gained its in
dependence from Great Britian,
in 1947, lndla experienced press
censorship. Further there were
tremendous restrictions imposed
on the activities of the opposition
party.

Though some may assert that
this period could be described as
Ms, Gandhi’s Purges. especially
with excesses including com»
pulsory sterilization in her Family
Planning Program, it may be
described as India’s economic
”Golden Period” in history. The
emergency saw increased output
in industry and agriculture. cur-
tailed anti-social activities and
disciplined the sluggish attitude of
the masses.

In 1977 the emergency was
revoked, and contrary to what her
son Sanjay Gandhi advised her to
do, she held new elections. The op-
position united itself as the Janata
Party, to challenged Ms. Gandhi's
dominating Congressparty, and
won, Due to internal fighting the
.lanata government crumbled
within two years and Ms. G ndhi
was reelected as Prime Mi ster
in 1980. The outcome of these

Students ready to
question the

Trustee Board

by Barbara Paul

The Board of Trustees will be
holding an informal social gather-
ing for students in Loose Hall
lounge today at 5 p.m.

Most students, when asked what
they thought the most important
question was for the trustees to
answer wanted to know why their
linanciai aid was cut. other
students want to know why there
are E minus grades but not B plus
grades. Many students, like Dave
Stagner, want to know why tuition
Continues to increase.

“Tuition topped ten thousand
this year,” he said, ”and that
scares me.”

Gavin Mulduwney said he would
like to know how allocations are
decided.

“I want to know how they decide
which departments to give money
to and how much,” he said.

Leslie Horne said that she would
like to see new and more equip-
ment in the weight room at the
PEC.

Perhaps the most political issue
although but new is that of why
the school invests in companies

who do business in South African
countries.

Tom Scott said, “Why is it that
we as a liberal college support the
repressive policies of other coun-
tries? I think you know what coun-
try I mean."

The organization at Students to
End Apartheid will be holding a
silent protest today from 4:30 to
5:30 p m. outside Gardner
Lounge. _

Participants Kris Schaefer said,
“It's a Symbolic gesture. We want
to Show the trustees the kind of
support we have on campus and
the number oi students who pro
test racial practices. Well be
meeting with the trustees
beforehand to let them know that
it isn t a negative protest .

“We’re not cutting down the
trustees and saying they’re‘imr
moral. We're trying to convmce
them to divest or to use their large
investments in South African

companies to make an effort‘to
change the minority-ruled, racist
South African countries."
