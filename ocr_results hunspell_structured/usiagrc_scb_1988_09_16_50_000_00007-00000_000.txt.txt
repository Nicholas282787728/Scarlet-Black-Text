The Big Easy

by Kate Nosan
In The Big Easy, Remy Mc-
Swain (Dennis Quaid) appears to
be a typical, hard-working detec-
tive who is good at his job only
because he isn't aflaid to bend a
few bureaucratic rules to achieve
the righteous end. It doesn't
seem to be a big deal that he
‘ parks in no parking zones and he
accepts a free meal here or there
It is quite disconcerting, though,
to ﬁnd out that he is accepting
thick wads of cash on a regular
basis from the "widows and
orphans fund." Not exactly heroic
behavior; actually down-right
criminal. Along comes Anne
Osborne (Ellen Earkin), the
uptight assistant district attorney,
who has been assigned to
investigate police corruption.
Initially, her investigation doesn't
get very far since Remy spends
most of his time, and hers, trying
to seduce her. After he succeeds,
she discovers his involvement in
the "widows and orphans fund"
which puts quite a damper on
their romance. In the end, he
learns a lesson, she learns to
lighten up, and the-course of,u-ue
love runs is path.

The best part of the film is
the soundtrack, an upbeat mix of
Cajun music known as Zydeco.

My Beautiful Laundrette

by Matthew C. Macho

The plot of My Beautiful
Laundrerte revolves around a
young Pakistani immigrant,
0mar','who seeks success and
‘good fortune in Britain. Omar‘s
father was a successful journalist
in Pakistan, but in Britain he is
an utter failure, reduced to
alcoholism. Omar gets backing
from Nasser, his successful
uncle, to rcfurnish and manage a
l'ati'ndr‘émat.‘
enlists the aid of an old friend and
lover, Johnny, who has become a
punk, a drifter. Sub-plots abound
as the film covers the confusion
of Nasser's beautiful daughter,
who feels neither Pakistani nor
British, and the tension Created by
Nasscr's blatant love affair with
his mistress, which eventually
prompts his furious wife to resort
to witchcraft

But the ﬁlm is really about
alienation--[oreigners in a
strange, hostile land, distant
family relations, unemployed
punks, urban despair, and gay

In the préccss, ‘he ' '

mcn facing hostility from every
direction. Interestingly, the
Pakistani characters are most
often the ones presented with the
least sympathy, as they
paradoxically exploit the land that
once sought to exploit them. A
strength of the ﬁlm is that it is
not afraid to place its truth above
risking offending anyone.

This film is mosl‘ilnpressive,
particularly because it is the first
screenplay by Hamf Kureishi,
who himself grew up an immi-
grant in Britain. Completed on a
low budget, My Beautiful Lanny
drelte impressed vicwcrs every-
where with its broad scope and
easy pace. While the narration
threatens to fall apart a bit in
places, it never does, and the
story holds together quilt: well to
make a fine, original film.

Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid

by Georgia Dcntcl

Although early Westerns were
morality play models, the
Western has always been larger
than life. That is part of its
attraction, a truth to which
Hopalong Cassidys, Lorie
Rangers, and John Waynes would
readily attest. However, in the
late l9605 a new approach began
to surface in the evolvemcnt of
Western cinema. Heroes who
were before always "pure" began
to be less so. They were not
"bad guys". but they had flaws
and might, heaven forbid, even be
reformed "bad guys". It was all

right to have been bad, just so
long that in their previous exis-
tence they had not been really
bad.

dance Kid elts such a story; and
coming as it did in 1969, it has
become recognized as a transi-
tional film in this genre. Butch
Cassidy self— parodies the
Western and as a result left itself
open as pleasurable contrast to
the more violent Westerns from
the sixties. Director George Roy
Hill (The Sting) loved a spoof,
thus the tongue-in-cheek,
audacious style of Butch Cassidy
came naturally to him. This film
raised young Robert Redford and
Paul Newman to box»office
success, spawned a television
series, and inevitably became

Arthur

by Seth Peterson

Written and directed by Steve
Gordon, Arthur is a comedy
about the kind of love which
transcends socioeconomic class.
Dudley Moore is Arthur, a child-
ish, drunken millionaire who
falls in love with Linda(Lizzt
Mnnelli), a lower class thief from

arranged marriage to a snooty
woman who seems only conr
cerncd with Arthur‘s drinking
habits. Arthur is an amiable.
funny drunk who seems to have
been saved from the vices of
hypocrisy characteristic of his
family. However, his love for
