AN OLD COMPLAINT
(From the Daily Iowan)

Democratic education, as it. is practiced in the mid-
west and other places where no intellectual aristocracy
is emphasized, has received another severe criticism
from Dr. Abraham Elexner, onetime Carnegie Founda-
tion expert, onetime director of the division of studies
and medical education of the Rockefeller General Edu-
cation hoard.

Dr. Flexner believes that the ideal college is u
sacrosanct. spot where only the wisest and most serious
may enter. He plans to erect, with the aid of a $5,000;
000 endowment, the Institute for Advanced Study which
will be just that sort of place.

“They,” said Dr. Flexner, referring specifically to
the University of Chicago and Columbia University,
“and many state universities, go into the market-place,
advertising their wretched claptra in newspapers and
in magazines, some of these aCtiV es are a little short
of dishonest."

Dr, Flexner was referring to correspondence courses
by radio and mail which enable many to obtain super-
ficial education whereas they might otherwise acquire
no learning at all.

Dr. Flemer‘s burst is nothing new. It is the age old
protest of the scholar who sees his accomplishments
being made less mysterious, less unattainable, by par-
ticipation ot the common herd. The idea of keeping
scholarship at a high peak by ruling out the uneducated
is ridiculous. And Dr. Flexner’s new institute is on
the way to proving that point.

Rather, let the masses bring themselves up to the
level of scholarship, even through the media of cor
respondencc courses, if no other methods are available.
Then if the scholarly world ﬁnds that it is no longer-
ahead of the rest of the race, can hold no position of
importance under the sun, let it step a few rods further
on for the masses to follow.

Thus, always, has progress been fostered.

T0 RUSSIA WITH HUTCHINS
(From the Minnesota Dolly)

That only the intelligent man wants an education
and that there is no need of trying to educate a person
who cares only for dates, speakeosies. and football is
one of the theories With which Robert Maynard Hutch-
ins, president of the University of Chicago, is startling
the educational world.

The first part of the theory, that only the intellir
gent man wants an education, is obviously false; can
readily be ascertained by a brief perusal of intelligence
scores made by college students. Unintelligent students
are attending colleges, which proves conclusively that.
some unintelligent people desire educations. What else
can account for their presence at institutions of higher
learning? Certainly no one goes to college merely because
it is the thing to do, or because his parents force him
to do so, or because of the social contacts he can make
there, or because of the valuable experience he can obs
taln in extracurricular activities. To suppose that such
reasons motivate college attendance would be absurd.
for what have they to do with education, the object for
which colleges exist?

The second part of the theory, that it is unnecessary
to try to educate people who care only for dates, speolr
caoics, and football, is a direct contrniliction of an
ancient American tradition Are we to allow some up-
start who has become a college president to overthrow
the ideals of our forefathers? Heaven forbid,

If Dr. Hutchins persists in such scar-chinined
theorizing, let him go to Russia, where his bolshcvisrn
would be welcomed. Anyway, he's a nuisance here; he
is always wanting to improve our education system,
which, as every patriotic American and every college
of education student knows, is virtually perfect. In
America there is no place for rebels.
