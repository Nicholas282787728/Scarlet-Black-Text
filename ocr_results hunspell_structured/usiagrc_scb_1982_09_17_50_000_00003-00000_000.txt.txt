KDIC broadcasts new sound

by Kevin McKeough

Now in its second week of regular broad-
casting, KDIC is featuring some of the
most diverse and innovative programming
in the station's recent history. In an all-out
effort to improve the station’s quality, the
KDIC staff has expanded the station's pro-
gramming to include jazz, reggae, folk and
classical music program, as well as the
ever popular rock and new wave formats.

In addition to the studenthostled music
shows, the station has purchased or
created several special programs which
will be aired on a weekly basis. Each Sun-
day, Charles Landauer and Jim Scott will
host an hour-long interview program,
beginning at 3 p.m. Listeners can call in
with questions and comments for the
show’s guests. Other interviews, such as
last Wednesday's taped interview with
U.N. Deputy Secretary Adelman. will be
broadcast on the station's nightly expand-
ed news program, which is aired at 7 pm.
Former US. Senator McGovern and
House of Representatives Candidate
Cooper Evans will be among the future
guests, as well as Evans' opponent Lynn

Review gears

by Beth Vilen

The Grinnell Review Committee is cur-
rently working toward another successful
publication of Grinnell College’s own
scholarly journal, The Grinnell Review.
Obtaining a positive response to a week-
long publicity campaign and the allocation
of 31,500 from the SGA general budget by
Joint Board were two recent committee
accomplishments.

This week’s publicity campaign included
two all-campus mailbox stuffs, radio spots
on KDIC, memo notices, posters and ver-
bal communication. All of this publicity
was intended to inform students about the
publication and the inner workings of is
production, In response to these various
advertisements, committee members
received positive comments about the
review itself, inquiries about the submis-
sions process and some subscriptions,

Due in part to the success of this publicir
ty, the committee with the help of the stu-
dent Publications and Radio Committee
was able to secure the approval of a Joint
Board allocation of $1,500 from SGA‘s
general budget alter much debate. in addi-
tion, The Grinnell Review was given the
status of a budget line item, which means
it will now be a permanent part of the SGA
budget under the media allotment. This
31,500 is a solid base trorn which the come
mittee can launch other fundraising at-
tempts.

Both the publicity and fundraising sue
cesses were aided by the fact that commit
tee members sold all but three of the re-
maining 100 copies of last year’s edition in
two days. The sales, which took place at
the table in the Post Office, provided
publicity for The Grinnell Review.

The Grinnell Review Committee,
chaired by Beth Vilen, is now in the pm-
cess of producing the 1933 Spring edition
with the same quality and professional
look that last year's review attained. Since
the publication procedure is complex, the
committee is divided into five subcommit-
tees. Publicity is chaired by Dana Wahrena
brock, and Brian Gratch is business and
finance chairman. David Abarr is selec-
tion committee chairman, while Holly
Whitten chairs layout and design. The
Editorial Board consists of Editorial Assis-
tant Barb Little and Vilen. Linda Rabben,

editor of The Grinnell Magazine, serves as
adviser for the group.

Currently the committee’s efforts are
concentrated primarily on fundraising and
publicity. ivory triatsoahas allocated the

tion at 1:30 this afternoon.

The “Archives" program will return this
year atter a threesemester absence from
the air, The 8 pm. program on Thursday
night features concerts taped at Grinnell.
Future programs will include concerts by
George Thorogood, Joan Armatrading and

.Koko Taylor.

Each Monday night at l2 a.m., the star
tion will broadcast “Midnight Theatre,” a
series of classic radio dramas. Forthcomr
ing episodes will feature the Shadow, the
Green Hornet and the Lone Ranger, who
can be heard on this Monday’s “lndian At-
tack and the Disgraced Lieutenant.” In ad-
dition to the “Midnight Theatre," “Arr
chives" and interview programs, the sta-
tion has made plans to broadcast a weekly
half»hour comedy show and a syndicated
Sunday night concert series, featuring ma-
jor British artists.

in keeping with the station’s spirit of in-
novation and new ideas, KDIC will host an
allrcampus “Radio Renaissance" party in

IIBWS3

WIM'WWJIZ

Garner Lounge on the first of October.
This particular date is signiticant, because
the station must file its relicensing ap-
plication by that day. A chronological
history of rock and roll from the 19505 to
the present will be broadcast live from the
party, by station D..I.’s. KDIC buttons will
soon be put on sale to finance the party.
The party is, in part, a token of the
station’s gratitude to the campus com-
munity for their support. In addition to the
party, the station recently began giving
away prizes. Grinnell students have won
pizzas, t-shirts, albums and imported beer.
KDIC DJ. Dan Klatz stated, “The chances
of Winning the prize from KDIC are real,
on a big radio station nobody wins.”

The wide variety of musical and special
programming available on KDIC reflects
the work of all the station’s staff members.
The staff hopes that by providing such
variety, the station will appeal to students
with a wide range ot tastes, 'and will
establish an increasingly consistent
listenership,

up for second edition

3 major campaign to obtain donations
from alumni and trustees, the Rosenfield
Program and other campus sources. Upon
the advice of President Drake, who will
also contribute a substantial, though as yet
undefined, amount, these ettorts will be
made through the college deveiopment or
rice. The committee is also soliciting
subscriptions at $4 per copy.

since last year's publication was
hindered because many Students did not
know what The Grinnell Review was, this
year’s committee is attempting to make
all pertinent information accessible to
students, For example, many students
seem to be confused by The Grinnell
Review Committee's relationship to More
tar Board, the organization which founded
and still sponsors the journal. Although
The Grinnell Review Committee retains a
strong tie to Mortar Board which provides

financial and advisory assistant as well as
a firm anchor ensuring the continuation of
the journal, it stresses that The Grinnell
Review is still a campus publication.
Other information often misunderstood
concerns simply the nature of the publica-
tion itself. The Grinnell Review is not a
literary magazine. It prides iself on pro-
viding a torurn for student publication in

academic and artistic areas as well as
literary and journalistic ones. Any original
student work is welcomed, including but
not limited to, academic papers, tiction,
poetry, photos, scientific projects and art-
work. The submissions deadline for all
written work is Nov. 25, for artwork and
photos, Feb. 7.

In December and January, selections
will be made. All submissions will be
evaluated only by faculty and student
members of the committee with a working
knowledge of the subject matter, Once the
selections have been made, the articles
will be edited. laid out in book format and
tinally published in a six by nine paper-
back, perfect bound journal The Grinnell
Review will not contain color reproduc-
tions this year because the process is ex-
tremely expensive. Also, the printers
which the committee can afford have
neither the equipment nor the expertise to
do it well.

Despite the lack of color pages, The
Grinnell Review Committee is optimistic
that the 1583 edition will be a well—written
and attractive publication. Moreover, the
enthusiasm and organization of both this
year’s new domember staff and printer
should ensure prompt delivery of The
Grinnell Review in May 0(1983.
