2 That the Student Council
send Written invitations to
cvcty club on campus to send a
nonrvotlng representative to as
many council mcctings as they
wish to attend, It was felt that
to have every club represented
on the council would be lmpraCr
tical and that it would be u
fair to let anly certain clubs
have representatives.

idea of using coupon books sim-

Arriving on campus sometime during the day of Sept. lti, alli
new students, freshmen, and transfer students were greeted indlr,

vidually by various student leaders. houscmothers, and members
of the administration.

Since college life and being away from home were complete-
ly new to a great many of us, a period of general chaos and confu»
sion lasted the remainder of the day. This confu on was hlgl‘ir
Egbted by such things as moving luggage and furniture, meeting,

next day and the return to a: hers,

tending the Student Council pic»
nie on south campus Wednesday
evening. Scpt. 19, ,

No diagnosis has been avail.
able, but 'it is definitely known
that ptomainc poisoning was not
the cause.

Followmg breakfast. groups of
new students met at halfrhourt
intervals on the chapel steps to!
go on tours led by upperclass-‘
men. On the tours we learned,
the whereabouts of the build-
ings and grounds which we had
seen in , pictures, and which
we'd be looking for in the days
’to come.

After meeting our social
groups for lunch, we assembled
in Darby gymnasium where we
were welcomed by Dean Max
Fuller, He greeted us with the
news that the rest of the after»
noon and the next two days
would be spent in taking oualr
tying examinations to determine
which classes we would be place
ed in.

The next day was much the
same, as all new students spent
the majority of their day at
Darby and the main topics of
discussion were whether or not‘
we would be exempt from one
subject or another.

On Tuesday evening, Sept.
18, there was a mass meeting ,
held in the Little Theater win
President Samuel Stevens ic-
ing the main address. Al
the talk, David Bruce Scottld
,music) led the group in sing. ,
ing Grinnclt songs.
Wednesday, 5 e p t. 19, was
our last day of testing. At '5230
p. in. all of the new students,
group leaders, and faculty caun-‘
selors met on south campus fax"
a Student Council picnic. Fol-;
lowing the picnic and more
group singing, most of us ad
journcd to Cowles hall for danCr‘
ing on the roof All went well
until about 10:30 p. in. that‘
evening. Then. as George Lovellt
(psychology) so aptly expressedt
it, "A great many of us spent‘
a night of great upheaval."

The next day we had our first‘

t

our programs. After individual
conferences, we completed most
of our program and had only to
registex, ‘
That evening we attended an»
other new student mass meeting.
It was led by Jim Morgan,Student
Council president. After an e
planation of the governing sy

‘tem at Gi‘innell, a mu'vie about
istudent life was shown,

Friday was spent in registrar
tion and the buying 'of books.
Being “green" freshmen, many
of us changed our program over
and over again, which generally
called for standing in the same
line a second and third time.
After finally getting straighten
ed out and completelv l'eglstel‘v
ed, we waited in mm lines at
the bookstore in order to puiu
chase our books.

Friday evening at ft p. in.,
we attended the very imm'
sive reception given tiy ii
dcnt Stevens at Younker hall,
Following the receptlun we all
went back to our ilornis to
change our clothes and go to
the pep rally in the women's
gym.

We attended our first college
football game Saturday night.
Although most of the upperclasse
men had joined us by that time
and had enlarged the school by
quite a number, many of us
found that a lot of the kids
