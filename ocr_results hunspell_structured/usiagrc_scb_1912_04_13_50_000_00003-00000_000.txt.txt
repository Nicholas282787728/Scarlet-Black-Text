GIRLS GLEE GLUE
MAKING MANY HITS

Press Notices Flattering — Five
Hundred People Turned Away
One Night—Traveling in Pri-
vate Car—“Harvey" Meals.

From all reports, the Western tour-
of the Girls' Glee Club is proving a.
decided success. That the ﬁrst exten
sive venture oi the Club into other-
ﬁelds has been one ot continuous pleas.
ure is very evident irorn the communi
cations to that etiect which have been
received in Grinnell.

The ﬁrst concert, which was given
in hioline, ml, was a ﬁnancial success
and not only paid the expenses into
Chicago, but netted about $30 besides.

Being Well Treated.

The tour is being made in the pri-
vate car “Lucienne,” but the meals are
secured at the Fred Harvey eating
houses, and, as some or the members
or the Club have said, a marked in-
crease in avoirdupois may be expected.

In every case the concerts have been
sung beiore appreciative arrdiences
and those which have taxed the capao
ity of the auditoriums in which they
were held. in one town the crowd
numbered over 1,000 and nearly .500
were trrrned away on account of lack
of room.

Leave of absence 0i one more day
has been sought in order to enable the
girls to make a side-trip to the Grand
Canon. They are expected in Grinnell
Monday. April 22.

Tile Association Gospel Team, coma

Carl Compton, spent a Week of spring
vacation In Gilmim, getting hold of the

and ideas into Lhe community.

The work was of the same general
type as is (lone by all college gospel
teams. The boys held services nightly
at which various members at the team
spoke. But while these meetings were
valuable and essential, perhaps the
most important work done was the per-
sonal contact with the boys or the town
during the day; for ii. is in this way
that college Gospel Teams can give
practical demonstrations or clean man

The subject was “The Single Eye."
The leader developed the thought that

A happy serson is one who seeks ﬁrst
the Kingdom of God, which is a rea»
