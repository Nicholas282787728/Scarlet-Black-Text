AS WE RETIRE

. With this issue of the Scarlet and
Black the old management steps
from in editorial chair and turns the
paper over to the men who will di-
rect the policies of the paper during
the coming year. AS We turn over to
the new management the typewriter
and the make-up stone; the "all" sell—
ing and editorial writing; the head—
writing, re-writing, and proof read-
ing, we do so with something at re-
gret at having to give up a job which
we have iust begun to learn, but with
full knowledge that those who are to
tollow will learn quickly.

a college paper is a good deal or a
laboratory. Those who control it
must- learn as they go along. It is
so with every new management. But
it they enter upon the task with a de-
sire to do their genuine best, a love
for their work, and. most 01 all, a.
love of their school, they can not help
but succeed.

Every newspaper, be it college

double lunction to perform.

, , “TllE BARB", A REVIEW.
1 No author will ever write a storyl
or college life that will entirely satis—
fy all college men, hyper-critics. That
is reasonably safe dogma. THE BARB
is a story of student activity in a
‘state university. The hero is unus-
ually mature, well—educated, a muJ
sical genius, a literary prodigy, a Eu-
ropean traveler. A piano rendition
or anything less that Tschaikowsky
causes him mental agony and the se-
ductive wail of a snxaphone would
qualify him for a padded cell. This
is the student whom we must follow
and whom we rnust sympathize. The

too clcver to be true, but the repar-
