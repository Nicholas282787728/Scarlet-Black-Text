ANOTHER. AOI‘IVITY
For the past six weeks, Lhe college
has been toccupied WiLh the activities
of the basketball squad, with semester
the
sedund semester, and the like, these ac-

examlnations, readjustment for

tivities completely overshadowing all
else. In the meantime, the debaters
have been plugging along, working to
be in shape tor the inter-collegiate
contests which they must wage in the
next month. The ﬁrst appearance ot
the local debaters will be Friday
night when a Gl'inuell negative team
meats Knox in a no-dccision debate
here while an afﬁrmative team your»
neys to Galesburg [or a contest on the
same night.

This is the ﬁrst year that a node»
cision debate has been waged on the
home ﬁocr altho the experiment has
been tried in previous years at other
schools. The no-deciSion type oi
torensic contest has become very pop-
ular thruout the country in the last
year or two and is being widely tried.
The purpose is to give the audience a
chance to decide the question on its
merits as presented, and not to bias
them by the opinions of one or three
or more judges. Such a method tends
to improve the duality o: the material
presented and to develop more etiec-
tive debating while it removes the
incentive for a'docision alone.

Debating is but one oi the many
varied activities of smash and is
'waged on the same general plan as
intenscholastlc athletics, althD, nab
wally, not as extensively. Grinnell
is to be represented in eight contests
this year and the debates Will center
on questions of importance in the
economic world today. Debating
serves a two-fold purpose. that of pro—
viding instruction and oi prov' his
work of general interest and training.
Grimell should support these contests
as generously and as enthusiastically
as She supports other phases of lib-
eral arts work, or other intercollegi—
ate contests.

THE CRISIS 1N DILAMA’J‘ICS

Grinncil is facing a peculiar situa—

but at present the complications are
decidedly embarosssing.

It has been the custom here for the
undergraduates to pleseut one or more
theatrical productions during each
year. The Dramatic Club play has
been a standard feature of the social
calendar, The society plays have had

It is unfortunate that Grinnell is at

el‘tect of this situation will he telt in

in the stifling of all desire for am-

somewhat in the position of the come

itself minus the theater. Whatever
the solution, immediate action Should
be taken if we are to cal‘l‘y out our
