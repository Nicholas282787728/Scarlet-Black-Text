Women
3-0 In
Exciting
Week

by Susan Thomas

With victories over Central on
Friday, Carleton on Monday and
Cornell on Wednesday, the
women’s basketball team enjoyed
an intense and exciting week.

In the Central game, which
Coach Ted Esktldsen described as
“the most intense basketball game
I’vebeenapartofsincei’vcbcenat
Grinncll,” the Pioneers were vic-
torious by a score of 69-63. The
way to beat Central was to prove
that the team could go after il and
pluyaphysic‘dlgnmc. The leam did
just that, with itnpresstve perfor-
mances by Suellen Hageman,
ShannonHancock,KicraHenryand
Tera Jones who “nculra1i7cd

proved to beafatal one forCentral.

added 20.

This was the first time in many
years, perhaps as many as 25, that
Grinnell has beaten Central in
basketball, so Coach Eskildsen
added that it was a “great win for
our women and for Grinnell Col-
lege."

On Wednesday, Carleton sur-
vived the icy roads before falling to
the Pioneers and their small, .but
nevertheless vocal crowd. Again it
was the Sharer-Wood duo who
postedthepoints,addtng26and25,
respectively, to the final score of
80-68.

Hageman and Jones played well
against Carleton's lnsldc big
woman, KateFrucwing, whoeould
be the best inside competition they
come up against all season.

”[I'm] extremely pleased with
each lndtvidual’s sacrifice and
commitmenttotherolesestablished
forthcm,"sdld Eskildsen. ”Every-
one is beginning to understand that
in order to be effective, they must
do a certain thing."

Against Cornell, the Pioneers'
first conference game. the team
pulled a decisive Victory, 7970.
Sharer led scoring with 31, while
Wood added 22.

Hancock played the "best game
ofhercarecr“ scoring l2p0ints and
bringing down 11 rebounds.
