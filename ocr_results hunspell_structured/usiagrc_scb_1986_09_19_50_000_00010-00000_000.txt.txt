Diversions. Those things that help your
mind escape from the academic battleiield
whenever possible. However, at Grinnell,
those “whenevers” are usually “itevers”.
'I‘tius Grinnellians have developed diver-
sions, some oi them physical, related to
even the most basic aspects oi iiie,

For instance, mealtimes abound with
diversion opportunities Gamblers delight
in the new games oi chance introduced
with each meal Strategists match wits
with the ice cream machines. And ior
those exercise-starved individuals,
nothing beats a good, clean, iood light as
an all around stress reliever,

As you hop in the shower to rinse the
totu i'roin your hair, think oi the diversions
associated with bathing and hygiene.
Water-gun lights are a big splash with
many. while toilet tissue decor parties
seem to be on a roll in some dorms. Those
musically inclined entertain iloor
members by singing, or making other
noises, in the shower Gamblers (always
opportunists) play poker with laundry
chips. (Can you guess how to determine a
notasosgood player?)

Though ‘sleep’ is a term with which
many Grinnellians are only vaguely
iamiiiar, students still engage in sleep»

widespread iavorite, but others par
