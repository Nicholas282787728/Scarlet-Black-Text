The untold story

Of legends, myths and faerie tales

by chhiC'Weiner
and
Jon Elbnuni

It's often been said that truth is
stranger than fiction. Well, not in
Grinnell. Over the years some
pretty lantastic stories have
developed into full fledged myths
cherished by Students and
prolessors alike.

But behind every myth the real
story is Waiting to be told.
Sometimes the truth is funnier
than the myth, but more often it is

l

just as mundane as you might-

expect, Either way, it’s ediiying
to burrow into the mound ol
Gl'lnnell legends to retrieve the
hidden Caches oi truth within,

For our lirst myth, vie lial‘ken
back to the days oi ilappcis and
tollics: the roaring twenties
Calvin Coolidge was president and
Gary Cooper was attending
Grinnell.

Myth: A {risky young
sophomore. “Cowboy" Cooper, us
he was attectionately called by
fellow Grinnellians, perpetrated a
typically sophomoric collegiate
prank. he took a horse up to his
room in Rawson towers. He was,
however, unable to coax the
animal back down. so the hapless
beast was destroyed. As a result,
Cowboy was ﬁrmly but politely
requested to leave school by an
unsympathetic President Main.

Truth: Gary Cooper never lived
In Rawson He was not kicked out
of school. in fact, he was quite a
serious, respectable student, a
member of one of the most
prestigious campus literary
societies. But whatever his merits
as a student, his acting abilities
were not recognized at Grinnell, as
he auditioned for. but was rejected
by, the college's dramatic club,

However, it is true that Cooper
never graduated. It was not his
deportmcnt but “the exigencies of
hie," Cooper says. which forced
his exodus from the college, it is
also true that, despite his
respectability, he became involved
in a shady incident involving ape
plejack, in violation of the 18th
amendment. Perhaps this episode
led to his present reputation as a
rakehell.

As for the legend oi the horse,
well, we Just don't know. Despite
the legend's persistence, we can
prove itneithertrue nor lalse. And,
yes, he was called Cowboy.

The Grinnell career of another
entertainment celebrity, jazz
musician Herbert Jeffrey Hans
cock, is equally clouded by the
mists of time. And in this case the
trust is just as strange as fiction.

Myth: llerbie Hancock was just
your ordinary pre~engineering
student who happened to play
piano on the side. 0nc latel'ul night,
a visiting jazz band heard the
young wunderkind jamming at a
campus llotspot. Astounded by his
talent, they whisked him away to
New York City, where instant
stardom awaited. Although a
senior, he never graduated—hut
Somehow, it didn’t matter.

Truth: Yes, it is true that Herbie
did not graduate in 1960, as he had
planned. It is also true that he
achieved fame and stardom in New
York. But the rest of it is bunk, The
fact of the matter is Herbie was
discovered later that summer in
his home town of Chicago by
Donald Byrd. From there he went
on to New York.

The reason he did not graduate
that year is far more pedestrian.
He had finished all the require-
ments for his, music—nut
engineeﬁngimajor, but neglected
to fulfill one essential obligation.
He didn’t pass the swimming

 

requirement

However. this did not Drevent the
College from awarding him an hone
orary degree in 1972. in 1976, the
swimming requirement having
been abolished, the college
relented and granted Herbie his
hard won diploma

have heard that this river also
flows under the Fine Arts building
which is also sinking not to mention
that this same river can be found
beneath the PEC which is not
sinking,

the 1915 Dober report, the loun-
dation oi the building is adequate
for its present weight and any
future expansion,

The aura of legend also
surrounds Chemistry Professor
Joseph Danforth, His achieve-
ments are legion and have inspired
numerous yarns.

Myth: Joe Danlorth invented
doublevsticking Scotch tape and
Late); paint. Because of the wealth
generated by the patents tor these
products. he generously waived his
Gi'iunell salary, accepting a token
51 per year.

Tmth: Denying this tale to fresh-
man Chemistry students would be
like telling Virginia there is no
Santa Claus. But we will tell you
this: Joe Danforth never worked
for 3M, the sole manufacturer of
double sticking Scotch tape.
Neither did he work for DuPont,
the makers of Latex paint. When
asked about the dollar per year, he
did not say that his salary was his
‘own business. but revealed that “I
have kids to send to school just like
anybody else." He did confirm he
holds patents on several
petroleum-related processes.
Maybe there is a Santa Claus.

Another persistent myth in»
volves one of the bestsloved
buildings on campus—and We don’t
mean Mears Cottage,

Myth: Burling library is sinking.
In planning the building the ar-
chitects forgot to calculate the
weight of the hooks, and as :1 result
the ediﬁce is slowly slipping into
the subterrain.

Truth: Funny you Should ask.
There are actually quite a few
dubious stories about the physical
plant. Like for instance, the
library is slipping because a river

Believe it or not, part ot this
could be true. According to
American Studies Professor
Charles Cleaver, who sat on the
committee which presided over the
construction of Fine Arts. an un-

conditioning system in Fine Arts to
be used in the winter to cool water
tilled pipes under plaza. But the
cost of running the air conditioning
system in the winter proved
prohibitive. The depth of the pipes,
however. remains uncertain.

While we‘re dwelling unr
dcrground, there is another myth
which must be explored: The
Tunnel Myth.

Myth: Running lieneixth lhc
college is an intricate netw -k oi
tunnels which connect . ol'tli
Campus with South. and points in
between. 8&0 uses the tunnels to
convey personnel and supplies.
avoiding the harsh “inter weather.

Truth: Although the truth is not
as romantic as the mvth. there are
tunnels running under the campus.
Three separate systems exist.
Under South Campus, Visible

four foot square tunnel built as a
conduit for Steam lines hot and
cold water, and power. Obviously.
this is too Small [or human
habitation.

Another tunnel goes from

and most extensive, runs along
Eighth Ave, to Younker, takes a
right turn and goes under the
loggia This gargantuan cavern
sports an eight-andahali foot
Ceiling. The tunnel was actually
used by EMS—workers to carry
supplies. Unfortunately. the tunnels
will someday be filled in because
moisture has deteriorated the
integrity oi the walls.

Lastly, we have it on tairly good
authority that the voice of Grinnell
was once heard throughout the
upper Mississippi vallcy, The

Myth: In iii 2 an enterprising

in no danger, however, because the

says Cleaver.

But according to present KDIC
station manager Kurt Anderson,
someone at KDIC did figure out a
way to expand the station’s range
so that it could be heard at great
distances. How did he do it? No one
knows.

We're sincerely sorry it we've
debunked some of your favorite
myths, but their durability in the
minds oi past and present Grin-
nellians convinces us that they can
withstand even the truth. And
maybe that's the way it should be.
