or homophobic humor on posters
and elsewhere, something which in
the past was taken for granted as

beingaform of harassment," Wetrler 5

said.

Hess said in another written state-
ment that because Judicial Council
is secretive about how it arrived at
the verdict, the ruling does nothing
to clarify the “general and vague”
deﬁnitionofhatassment in Grinnell‘s
Student Handbook.

"We are all left in the dark as to
what is the community’s judicial
interpretation of the handbook‘s
definition," Hess said. “JudtCo.
should at least offera clearer picture
of how harassment is deﬁned on this
campus."

Kent said the ruling restored “in-
tegrity” to college regulations.

“I feel the harassment charge has
been abused on this campus to the
point of meaninglessness," he said.
“This decision is a step towards re-
storing some degree of integrity to
the harassment regulation, a move-
ment away from its use as acatchrall
violation."

Alanna Tyler, vice-president of
the Student Govemment Associa-
tion and SGA‘s representative to
Judicial Council, said the complain-
ants‘ second grievance —~ which
charged Kent with intimidation and
interference with Judicial Council
proceedings — would not be de-
cidedby JudicialCouncilandwould
be handled by the president’s hear~
ing board.

Questioning in the hearing cen-
tered on Kent’s intent in putting up
the poster.and on whether the poster
addressed a recognizable group on

of demonstrators being blown up by
canoon character Spot the Wonder
Dog and bore the slogans “Bleed,
hippies,bleed.”0therposters putup
by Kent said of hippies, “You must
kill them.”

Thecomplainantsarguedthatthey
felt “threatened” by the poster and
feared someone would act on its
suggestion.

“Knowing Mike‘s politics by his
columns in the paper, I felt that per—
haps somebody could take it seri-
ously,”Wemer said during the hear-
ing.“l feltitwasencouragingpeople
to attack me.“

“Often times, supporters of the
right wing sometimes see violence
as a means as achieving goals,”
Wemer said. He said he himself had
been the victim of violence when
taking part in demonstrations.
"Bottles and rocks have been thrown
at me during protests," Werner said.
“People have even threatened to
shoot me.”

Hess also said violence is “within
a Grinnell student’s behaviort lkrlow
people who keep guns on campus.”

But after further questioning, the
complainants admitted the poster

probably wouldn’t cause students to
attack anyone. "I’m not expecting
anyone to blow anyone up,” Hess
said,

Kent defended his poster by say-
ing it was meant to be funny,

"l'he context is obviously humor-
ous," Kent said during the hearing
“Even the name ‘Students Against
Hippies’ implies it is a parody of
existing student organizations,” he
said.

“I knew there would be some who
wouldn’t like the signs but I never
thought people would take it seri-
ously," Kent said. He said that for
people to call the postcr harassment
they would have to be “seriously
biased or looking for something to
call harassment."

“l don’t know how the caliber of
person going to this college could
interpret my posters as a direction to
build a bomb and blow up people,"
Kent said. “The poster never said
‘Kill the hippies,‘ never ‘00 take a
gun and kill someone,m he said,

“It’s not advocating violence, it's
making fun of the status quo," he
said, “Why can’t I annoy people?"

On the issue of whether the poster
actually addressed members of the
campus community, there was also
extensive testimony and question»
ing. The complainants said that they
match the posters’ portrayals of
hippies as bearded people holding
signs in a demonstration.

“You can identify hippies on
campus,” Hess said. “Demonstra-
tors can equal hippies.”

“If I look like a duck, walk like a
duck, talk like a duck — then I must
be a duck,” Hess said.

Hess said he’s not sure what a
hippie is, but said he knows what
Mike Kent thinks a hippie is.

“Mike Kent has made it very clear
who helhinks are hippies—protest-

ers, people wwing pink triangles,
etc,” Hess told The Scarlet and
Black

Kent said he does not consider
anyone at Grinnell to be a hippie.
”The term cannot be used in refer-
ence to a specific individual,” he
said. But Kent admitted that some
students at Grinnell “exhibit hippie
like characteristics.” A hippie might
be "someone who eats granola for
breakfast, lunch and dinnerand then
goes homeand smokes a jointbefore
going to bed," Kent said.

Kent said his posters needed to be
unusual because Students Against
Hippies “is a different type of ore
ganization" that is intended for
”closet conservatives.” At Grinnell.
Kent said, there is “a certain stigma
attached to being conservative. No
one wants to be someone everybody
is always making fun of," he said.

Kent said he has filed an addi-
tional Judich Council case against
Peter Kazenoff and Matthew Morri-
son for violating his freedom of
speech by tearing down Students
Against Hippies posters. Jennifer
Krohn, advisor to Judicial Council,
was unavailable for comment.

Kent said in a written statement
that Students Against Hippies will
start putting up more posters next
week. He said the group plans to
publish a newsletter, hold panel dis-
cussions and host social events. The
group is also planning “a violence-
based Nintendo game tournament,
the Arnold Schwarzenegger film fest,
the S.A.H. Tuna Feed, a war-toys-
for—deprived»children drive, a Nol-
len-lawn them-bush project, hetero-
sexual pride week, and a ‘Let's Nuke
Noriega‘ petition drive," Kent said.

An individual “making a political
statement” doesn’t have “to make
sure everybody loves him,” Kent
saidt

preached Moore from behind. He
drew the knife across Moore’s neck
and quickly across his chin, and then
calmly folded the knife and put it in
his pocket, witnesses said.

The fight soon stopped, with
Moore left out and bleeding and
Ahmad lying on me ground. badly
beaten. Police chief Dan Boyer said
Ahmad was apparently carried back
to campus by the Grinnell students.

Police chief Dan Boyer said the
kniﬁng was “pretty coldrbloodedt"

“For that man to come up behind
Dennis, first of all, and then to re
main so calm afterwards made his
act seem to me to be a pretty offenr
sive as opposed to a defensive act,”
Boyer said. “And that was what was
most disturbing.”

Ahmad, a student at Queens Col-
lege in Flushing, New Yodc, was
allegedly visiting his girlfriend here
at Grinnell.

SergeantRandy Hanssen.the offi-

cer who filed the official report. said
that two phone calls were received
regardingtheincident. The first was
from someone who had overheard
conversation about the fight and
decided to contact the police, and the
second was from Moore’s mother,
who called Sgt. Hanssen at home.

“Something happened in that al-
ley, and we’re looking to stop it,"
Hanssen said. “We can’t have these
fights between college kids and lo-
cals.”

“What’s really important is to
recognize that we have a certain
amount of animosity, which is not
unique to Grinnell, between locals
and college students,” Boyer said.
“But neither the police department

Vnor Grinnell College is going to tol-

erate it.”

Once the New York police locate
Ahmad, he will be brought back to
Grinnell to stand trial.

All of those charged with disor-
derlyconducthaveappearance dates
set for either Nov. 7 or 14.

Drake also said that Fine Arts is
“noisy,” which presents problems
for the music depanrncnt.

The inadequacy of Roberts Thea-
ter is another problem thata new arts
building could correct, Drake saidt
Roberts has very little scene con-
struction space and no “fly space,”
prohibiting the raising and lowering
of sets during productions. Thepoor
acoustics of the theater inhibit the

isreally "more of an auditorium than
a theater,“ said Drake.

The planned theater is designed
like an old opera house, with a main
seating ﬂoor and two wrap-around
balconies. A system of hydraulic
elevators allows the ﬂoor of the
theater to drop down, creating an
arena theater, or to raise up. creating
a thrust stage.

When Fine Arts is renovated,
Robcns Theater may be turned into
a music recital hall. The college is
currently using Herrick Chapel for
recitals.
