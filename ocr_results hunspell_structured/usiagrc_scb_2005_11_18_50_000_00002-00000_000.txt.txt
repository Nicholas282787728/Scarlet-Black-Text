Criticism of anti-Coke campaign
Coke, cont. from p. l

Kalkbrenner felt rhe initiativc did not pass this year because of
increased information on campus, “This year, as I understand it, the
students had more debate about the boycott and the evidence for
and against Coke. I am delighted to see that,"lie said, “That is what
a liberal arts education is about: learning to think.”

Joint Board Senators Max Postman ’08, Davis Hart ’08,]ustin
Abramson ’08 and Matt Johnshoy be organized the “anti-nnlir
Coke" campaign in response to what they call "fluffsourccs" such
as Mildred/term” cited on boycott posters. The senators formed an
adrhoc committee to find objective sources of information.

“Most of our sources came through their sources," Postman ex.
plained. Ultimately, the group felt LASG and boycott supporters
were not providing a full picture of the issues in Colombia.

“This is a college where ideals get put before facts and people
are unwilling to be challenged," Postman said. “It’s enthusiasm that
borders on hysteria.”

Postman also said the group was uncomfortable about the alter-
natives offered. “Good alternatives were not offered. In fact, alterna»
rives were viewed as irrelevant. No consideration was given for the

[human rights] record ofPeps-r"

For the record: correction
from our last issue

In the Oct, ii News story about lapanese courres,
we incorrectly identiﬁed the official department as
the ”Chinese” department I! is actually the "Chi-
nese and lapsnese” department

The headline oi that article, which referred to
planned CUB allwtrlhlrds or the Japanese loculty,
was misleading Only one position will not be lilled
We incorrectly raid that there are no nonrlanguagc
classes with which siudenu can build an indepenr
dent major, There are classes outside the language
sequences,

The decision whelher Mamie lorenhy, Chinese and )
rapanerc, will continue is not to be made by the
Executive Council, but by a subcommittee on short-
term hires -

Grinnellian to
receive diplomatic
scholarship

One Grinnelllan of thc class of 2005 or 2006 is
going to receive a 310,000 scholarship towards gradu-
ate school studying international relations.

The Diplomatic and Consular Ofﬁcers, Retired
(DACOR) Bacon House has chosen Grinnell Cole
lege as one of eight nominating institutions for it’s
annual fellowship this year.

The nominating institutions are selected on the
basis of the strength of their international programs.
“I think it speaks loudly to the college's commitment
to international relations and the international com—
munity,"said Doug Cutchins, director ofSocial Com-
mitment, “[Grinnell] is a place that puts a great deal
of emphasis on internationalism and that is being rec
ognized with this honor."

George Washington University (Elliott School),
Georgetown University (School of Foreign Service),
Tufts University (Fletcher School), Johns Hopkins
University (SAIS), University of Southern Califorr
nia-San Diego, University of Alabama, Ursmus Col—
lege and Gtinnell will each nominate three candidates
and one from each school will win the scholarship

To be one ofthe three candidates members ofthc
classes ofzoos or 2005 must fill out a full application,
which includes a curriculum vitae, transcript, and es-
say and is due on Nov. 28. Any graduate schoolwork
applying to the international community is acceptable,
including language studios and law school focuses on
international relations or business.

DACOR is a fellowship of government workers
who have worked in international relations and who
want to encourage others to do the same,

The twenty four candidates will go to Washington
DC. and stay in the DACOR Bacon House in early
March. Each nominee will interview with a commitr
tee ofcarecr diplomats, and one student from each
school will receive the scholarship toward their grade
uate school studies.

What would you do differently if Grinnell had twice
as much money as we do and it could be spent on
anything? What if we had half a: much money as
we do and had to cut back?
*ﬂlblrlllftd by Daniel Grorshcrg '05 .5
Hopefully, we would not fundamentally change our mission or
at least I wouldn’t because I believe in it. That is, in being a tradir
tional liberal arts college that educates students broadly to malts a
difference in the world. Ifwe had twice as much money, we could
probably eliminate most fees and fund more generously some of
the great things we do, but don't Fund everyone. If we had half as
much money the faculty would be smaller and we could not be
need—blind in ﬁnancial aid. I would not change our size much even
if we were richer or poorer. Finally, I would hope in plenty or in
penury we would remain committed to making a difference in the
world for good.
