Little towns,
big emotions

Two award-winning films come to Harris this weekend

Jeremy: This week's movies run the
omononol gamiir from earth sharrering loss
to life afhiining cinematic sesrasy, 1n ins
Bet/mom, Cinema prridiro, .tnd rhe Cultuml
ﬁlm, Ei-r/ Drink Man \Vam/m, aie all main
reriully realized pieees orsroryrelling. You
wont get a much berrer seleerion offilins
rhan rhis.

Erndlcy: And rhen rhsre's some teen
Shakespeare movie in rhe Foium,

In the Bedroom (R)

Here's the Pitch: A ml: from the Old
Wssr ser in New England,

B: This inrriguing drama was rl-ie leasr
known or lasr year's osenr contenders. It
followsan old eoiiple (Sissy spaeek andTom
Wilkinson) eoping wirh rheir son's
(Nick stahl) rragie "summer
fling" with a young, noosingle
mother (Marissa Tomel).

J: There's nothing
wholly new in rhe sons
espr or the ehanerers,

A small New En»

gland rown, full of ,

character: too 2

good (Stahl’s 5

Frank), too bad

(the :x-l‘lusband

played by Tom Cruise's creepy cousin Wile
liam Maporher), and roo eonfliered (every.
one else) ro live normal lives. Things begin
to explode when rhe cit-husband returns
and is not too happy wirh Tomei's younger
man.

Todd Field wrote, directed, produced.
and opeiared rhe osmera on rhe film, and
his dedioarion shows. Despire being his first
fearure, rhe final produer is a disriner, can»
sisrenr. and rolenrlessly peisonal movie. The
charaorers are vividly drawn by Field, bur
the brilliance of the film is whar happens
when rhey sneounrsr eaeh other, when ev.
eryihing heeomes fair game and no one an

hide in the bedroom any longer.

B: Miramnx's markeriiig campaign for
rhis movie focused henvily on sissy spaeek,
whirh didn't make sense ro me. Her ehar.
asrer has lirrle nngksho is eonsrendy dis<
tressed, and is eirher shouting orsulleii.The
real srri ofrhe film is'l'om Wilkinson His
parernnl figure shows men more on Inns-
Formation rhroughour die him, from one
lessly living vieariously rhrough his son's
latest eonqiissr to heing griefsrriekeis, and
coolly vengeful.

J: l agree. Wilkinson was my ossar fa-
vorirelssryear Burdon'runderesrimarerhe
rest of this writhey all play wirh ‘uiered.
ible eonvierion end power. This movie's an
emorional roller coaster, more likelyro make

you ery rhan laugh, bur you'll feel
good abour it afrerward,

Cinema Paradiso: The New
Version (R)

Here’s the Pitch: See one boy's life
changed by movies!

)3: Cinema Paradise was firsr released in
1988, and is roo gor some Oscar norice—
it won rhe Besr Foreign Language Film
award. The new version, released in June,
features 51 eddirional minures of movie»
loving goodness.

J: The movie is an autobiographical ae—
eounr of dirsoror Giuseppe Tornarore's
ehildhood laseinarion with the movies and
his giowrh inro a film diresror, Mosr ofrhe

_ s
grey Span/e and Tom \Vil/einmn ﬁe! oner lvir/o Sta/71hr the Bedroom.

story is rold as an extended flashbeek ro
salvnrore's ehildhood and adolesrenee in a
small sieilian rown afrer he hears rhe ncws
rhar his friend. rhe movie projectionlst
Alfredo, has died.

B: l've only seen the original veisioii.
wirh very bed dubhing (shame on you,
Loop's Video), so 1 on'r eririoue me new
roorago, or me aeron' vosal prowess. For
all I know, young salvarore does sound or-
aerly like Harry Porror.

J: l reeenrly warehed the original Ver—
sion also, but wirh subrirles (rhe way for-
eign films should be, as lralians have, ironin
oally, never undersrood), sol ran assure you
rhar the aering is top notch. The aeror play.
ing ren.year.old Salvatore is as impressive
as l've ever seen a child aeror, and lovable
Alfredo is )ust rhar.

B: This movie makes me appreeiare
beings movie pmjeerionisr, alrhough it doc
show me perils orrhe job, And believe me,
ii gets lor worse rhan last sarurday nighrs
The Tart: ofodrers screening/burning.

I: I admit l'm a hole biased in my re.
view of this ﬁlm; it is a movie abour the
love orwarehing movies and l mu review
rhar abour as objectively as rhe pubeseenr
lényenr-old boy down rhesrroer an review
Slim/girth Regardless, I rhoroughly enjoyed
rhis movie It speaks to anyone who has
been raised in a small rown, or been abso—

liirely obsessed by somerhing, anyone who
has a friend, or a family, or has loved and
lost But mosr imporranrly, ir reminds Lu
of she msgie of ihe einema, and ofa rime
when going so die movies was a Commuv
niry experience, an evenr mosr of us will
rarely or never experience.

Brad's hsr gasp: movie for people who
love movies, bur nor dishes.

Jeremy's verdien go, and rake all your
friends, and lough and slap andenjoy your.

For one month, John Chzva ’05 has eaten almost cx-
clusively hot dogs. Now, the canhost of “lohn and Admin
Suck ir in Your Ear" claims, “hos dogs and l are gerring a
divoree. ltyou've had as many hot dogs as l have I've
been here for one month and I’m ready to go home." For-
runately for 1(ch lisreneis, Chavez's ol\:»yar partneiship
wirh Adam sehwaro. '05 has yet ro go sour, “We have n
ehemisrry," Chaver explained.

“Yeah," said Schwarn, “there's a real connection. john
really penerrares my soul wirh his soul over and over again
And that's the connection,"

“I feel the length of Adam's spirit," added Chavez, be
loresropping himselfand saying, “We need ro waroh whar
we say because last time we couldn't show the interview to
our parents. ”

"Door prinr any sweais, because lasr rlme, you had me
saying rhe r.woid and l oouldn'r show my mom and dad,"

agreed SdiwarrL.
"l felr guilry abour showing my grandma, burl did
anyway," said chavsz.

A lor has shaiiged since she lasr rime rhese rwo Dis
found shernselves in rhe m9 (ref: volume 118, No. l0,
Nov, 16, zool. “Music in your ears"). Chnvzz deseribes
rhe differences as, "Less German
drinking songs and more rsehnisal
know how,"

For sehwariz, ir's all nbour ink
rude. “We're nor nearly as excited
and 'on my God we're on rhe air' as
we were hetore. lr's rnueh morcxub»

"We're like 'yeah. we have a ran
dio show," said Chavez. "We're cor:

DJs now. We're gonna build a new

KDIC. Wlth super eompiirers,"

“And roeker ships," sehwnro
joked.

While guest interviewer Main

ire rhe sound 0F”Stick it in Your Ear," Chnvee was quick
to stare. “AsWill Smith would say, we‘re the new horness."

"so we're like Will smirh saying rerarded rhingsz" dise
agreed sehwarrr. “I ihink the hesr you eonld say abour our

"Righr," said chives. "kighi when you think we're

A lot has changed since

“It mighr be rook and roll or post-rock and roll," laughed
Chavez.

Despite Schwariz's inirial 2001 explanarion, (“When
John meets a young lady and he's
atriaered ro her, he rends to assume
rhar she reeiproearrs her feelings
and says, he me stick it in your
ear,"') Chavez finally revealed the
rrue origins of die show's name,

“It earns from rhese kids from
where l worked," he said. “I worked
ar Baseball Central for all of my
working life. Whenever a MILF
would oorne in, my co—workerMatt
would say ‘l’m gonnasriek it in her
