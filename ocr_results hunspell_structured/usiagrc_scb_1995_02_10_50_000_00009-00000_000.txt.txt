Isn’t anyone romantic anymore?

Grinnellians seem to have lost the romantic spirit, if they ever had it

By TRISHA HOWELL
Staff Writer

OU all know it's coming.
There’s no way to avoid it.
The rush on paper dbllles.

red construction paperandconversa-
tion hearts has begun, It‘s Valenr
tine’sDayandpeoplcarepissedabout

But why all tlle cries of agony?
Why is everyone out there eringing
from this commercialized orgy of
romance? What could possibly ex-
plain the phenomenal lack of plans,

interest in this holiday?

lam not presuming to have big
pinns for the day myself. Do not look
to me for inspiration. So far the
works of Henry James are all that’s
pellcilcd in my date book. It‘s not
that I lack romantic ideas or desires,
I’mjust broke. Romance does not
come cheap'

However, after years offighting
my boyfriend's loathing ofthe dzty, I
refuse to abandon all hope. There
must be someone out there who I can
live through vicariously, So I started
to ask around in hopes offinding that
one person on the Grinnell College
campus who is doing something roe
mantle on Tuesday. Here's what I
found:

Riva is planning to order gradu-
ation announcements.

Heather is going to the Cornell
game or studying for organic.

And then there's Anthony. He’s
just really sad that Eric’s in Denver.

Obviously I was looking in the
wrong place. So 1 called my friend
Doug. better known as Captain Ro-
mance, I knew his girlfriend was
coming all the way from Colorado
the day after, so surely they were
doing something, even if it would be
postponed aday, But no. Nothing.
Not one thing. If you can't count on

feeling hopeless, lost and lookin' for
love?

The bar. Why not? It was
Wednesday night afterall. Ifnothmg
else, I ﬁgured the alcohol would irlr
spire people to make up lies about
romantic getaways to, I don’t know,
Des Moines‘.7 Pella? Who cared? All
Iwanted was one happy loveyrdovey
type person.

 

Talk about“lookin forlovein all
the wrong placesl” The ﬁrst pcrsenl
asked, Jesse, said his plans for
Valentine‘s Day (or “VD” as he re
ferred to it) were to “dress in black
and break things." And Lhis is a
student adviser! A man who is sup
posed to be responsible for molding
and shaping young freshman while
providing comfort and support for
others! I ﬁgured it had to get better.

Again, I was wrong. My ques
tion of “What are you doing for Val»
entines Day?" revealed a campus
ﬁlled with depressed, desperate and
destructive students. The responses
were truly frightening:

“Setting fire to old Valentine's
Day cards,"

“You mean before or after I hurt
myself?"

“Ijust got laid this weekend, so
I’m not too worried about it any
more."

“Valentine’s Day? When is it?"

I ﬁgured I had hit bottom when
Craig explained thatValentine’sDay
was just a way of saying “Here’s a
reminder that you suck, because no
one cares." For God’s sake people!
Can’t someone be happy? Must the
Mental Health Center hire additional
staff to get the campus through this

every year?

I did ﬁnd one person with a
positive attitude. Deanne said that
shejust “loves love," Ofcourse, she
also added that she loves daiquiris,
me, Julie, Derek and everyone else
who happened to be at the bar, so I
figured her answer was inspired by
s0mething other than just a love of
romance. Somethingthatwould wear
off before the big day,

1 did find a couple people who
offered me a little hope. Well, they
were offering something anyway.
Eric says he doesn't have a girl-
friend, but if he did he would “buy
her ﬂowers and take her to Rube's."
He added that his phone number is
x4025, Jeremy Wanted everyone to
know that he's also available and “I
have this diamond ring and I just
don‘t know what to do with it." His
number is x4023. Apparently desr
peration knows no boundaries on
Cowlcs 3rd.

Not that these two were the only
lonely souls at State Street. Behind
all the bitter, angry, frightening an-
swers were very unhappy people who
were quite willing to expound on
their problems. After all, alcohol is a
depressant. Basically, everyone was
quitewillingtodosomethingromm
tic,Lheyjustdidn’thaveanyonetodo
it with. It all boiled down to, as one
person putit, “No one loves me. lam
alone." Well, there was also a sub-
stantial “I'm pissed cause I can‘t get
any nookie" crowd, but that's part of
the same problem.

To sum it up, I was not the least bit
successful in ﬁnding anyone with big
inspinng plans for Tuesday. It seems
that most of the campus is lonely and
eithertooshy ortoocluelesstodosome—
thing about it. Maybe it’s just me, butI
always thought that Valentine's Day
was a good time to do something about
being alone. Apparently I was wrong.
Despite my ﬁndings I plan to have a
wonderful Valentine’s Day and I refuse
tobelievethatno oneelsewill, Ican only
