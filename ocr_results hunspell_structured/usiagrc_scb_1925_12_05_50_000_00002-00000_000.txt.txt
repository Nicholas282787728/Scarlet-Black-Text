TO OUR VISITORS.

This is the sixth time that Gi-inhell
has had the pleasure of Welcoming
the convention delegates of the Iowa
high school press association.

It is hoped, not only by those who
are assisting you in the convention,
but by the entire student body, that
your short stay here has been pro!-
itable. You are here primarily be-
cause you want to learn something
about journalism and you are no
doubt taking that part of the program
seriously. On the (ﬁber hand every-
one desires that you have some fun so
that you will not go away feeling that
you have attended a convention or the

 

six Week’s test association.

The Scarlet and Black hopes that
you will like Grinncll well enough to
return again. Grinncll students, like
those from any college and univcrsity
are well “sold" on their school.

As a journalistic school Grinncll has
a lot to commend her. On paper she
should not rank as high in that de-
pcrtmcnt as many other institutions,
yet it is results that count. Grin.
nell graduates easily laud journalistic
jobs and thcir advancement is usual-
ly rapid. It seems to bear out the
belief that the best journalistic train.
ing is at good liberal arts course sup-
plemented Witlli a small amount or
specialized training,

We are glad to have you here.
For your

own sakes do not let the past two days
suffice for your college education.
Whether or not you go to Grinnell is
a. small matter compared with whethr
er or not you go to college. The main
thing is that you go. Wherever it may
be the Scarlet zmd Black wishes you

success.

did the ruling." said Gard. “Although
the previous hing had married ﬁrth
tlircc wives, Supaydlat saw to it that
Thilmw had none but hcrscli. Shc
ﬁred the king’s ministers, and put to
death seventy l'wals for the throne.
The bodies of these were thrown into
n pit in the palace grounds, hastily
covered with dirt, and trampled by
elephants."

Mr. Gcrd's Contact with tho exruucen

reception given to Gard by Supoyalat.
each or these Burllmns present lied to
remove his sandals before entering the
room, and was not_supposed to look

tsrly of the treatment received from
her captors, and commented on politi.

where a feast had been prepared in
my honor."

Mr. Gard also spoke of the national-
ist movement in India, where he was
for three ycars an Associated Press
