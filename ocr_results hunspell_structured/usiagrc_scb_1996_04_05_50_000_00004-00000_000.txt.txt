Misperceptions of Public Figures
Continue to Run Rampant

I ﬁnd it hard to believe, given
the relative intellect of the average
Grinnellian, that anyone here would
dispute the idea that facts are warped
from source to viewer in virtually all
forms of media. a warping directly
linked to political affiliation Ho\v«
ever, given the poli cal ideology of
the median Grinnell student, I am
also aware that certain such warpings
are nurtured by the political envi—
ronmentoithe college. Due to these
two factors, I have seen rather gross
misinteipretations of public figures
in myshottstayath’tnnell. Many of
these pertain to public figures con—
nectcd with politics. Forexample ,,

Rush Limbaugh has the largest
audience among all American polit<
ical radio talk show hosts, and it
angers liberals to no end that he is so
successful. Few people recently have
been as often deiamed as he has,
There are several things about Rush
that anger most people with liberal
tendencies: 1) He is conservative
and does not apologize for it. 2) He
seems overweln-iingly supercillious.
3) He often mocks the current lead—
ers of the liberal movement along
with many of the singleissue {ac
tions within it.

As far as the first concern, viz.
being conservative without apology,
I find it rather interesting that the
party of the supposed enlighrened
(those who understand that men,
the rich, and our nation’s history are
all evil) find fault with someone who
has the courage of his convictions.
The latter two problems come from
the listener’s not understanding the
context of the show, Many hostile
listeners simply listen to find things
about which they can gripe, things
for which they can get mad at Rush,
things that reaffirm theirhate (or the
conservative movement. These peo»
ple do notunderstandthatpartofthe
show is entertainment, I myselfdid
notparticularlyenyoyhearingRush's
egotistical tirades and slogans when
tirst hearing the show. However,
one eventually realizes that he says
most oithese in test, “Talent on loan
from God," ”With halfmy brain tied
behind my back. last to make it fair,”
and "I don't need equal time ~ I am
equal time," are not meant to be
taken seriously.

As far as mocking others, he
mocks congressmen when thcy say
things iust for Votes, he mocks spe-
cial interest groups when they think
the whole or the nation should bow
down to their cause, and he mocks
publicfigures(Republicanand Deni-
ocrat alike) when they say things
that deserve laughter as response

accountability,studentaccountabih
ity, and the power of the states, Rush
derides him because his words never
matchhis actions, Clinton is backed
by the teacher's union, who opposes
teacher accountability (though they
don’t state it as such), and the con—
gress has sent hills that wotild accom—

Rush also has the disfavorahle
position of being publicly attacked
on personal grounds because [us at-

because i have thoscn a petty way to
assault Clinton, but those who do
the same to Rush do not have the
same problem because they are in
sympathetic company

Buchannan also has been niis»
represented almost everywhere. Do
nottaltethisthe wrongwa ,Buchan»
nan's beliefsystem is so tar removed
from most students’ at Grinnell that
most would not vote for him anyway,
Buchannan is vehemently opposed
to feminism, which the media turns
into being opposed to women He
states that the Mexicangovemment
is inferior, which turns him into a
racist. He feels that Oatt, Naita,and
similar treaties give away American
sovereignty, and this makes him an
isolationist. He says that Hitler was
a genius, which instantly makes him
an anti—semitc Hesays many things
which are true, and the students of
Grinnell, along with many- others
around the nation, make unstlpptitt»
ed inferences.

There are some things that the
students here are right about. Pat is
antlrhomosexual, he is against abor.
tion, and he has written, mostly ea «
her in his life, editorials that seem to
promote protectionism, which the
public immediately reads as lsolcr
tionism. He is a stalwart Christian,
and this causes many ofhis views. In
the end, the media really-dislikes him
because he is not ati-aid ra say what
he thinks, unlike others.

There is one oilicr mayor rumor

“Free and Fair Group”

tions, certain anonymous students,
calling themselves the “Fiee and Fair
Group," posted signs around the
orinnt-ll campus with attacks on

student Organisation, is outraged at
this slanderous act We are shoclsed

Features Section
To the Editor:

It has recently come to my at«
tention that Bruce Friedrich’s posh
tion as Features Editor of the 5&E
has beencalled intoouestion. Iwould
like to add my name to the list of
those whoare frustrated by Friedrich’s
weekly Features section, It is not
that 1 find Friedrich's opinions to he
too radical or leftrwing; on the con—
trary, i agree with many- of the posi.
tions Friedrich raltes. Despite the
fact that I agree with his opinions,
however, they are exactly [linti
opinions. AltlioughFriedrich is core
(ul to cite the academic sourcesofhis
positions, he is still not presenting
them as DbJECUVe journalism A
statement such as this one he made
last week is typical of his writing
“This format is not long enough for
me to debunk all the myths of main—
sneamcultttte.” Anyseltrespccting
ioiirnalist would admit that such a
statement belongs in anopinioncol-
umn. not a Features article It is not
the duty of the Features editor to
inform the campus that “it is our
responsibility to teens otirentire lives
in some way which recognizes that
[members of Third World nations]
um human heings." As a gen a1
rulc, sentences which begin with the
words “I think " have a hard time
posing as objective iournalism

used this statement as evidence to
