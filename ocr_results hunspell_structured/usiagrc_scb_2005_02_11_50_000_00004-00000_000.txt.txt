On Feb. 8, in the wake of the stu-
dent referendum last semester to boy-
cott Coca-Cola products, Students, tics
ulry, and stirtorcrinncll College met
with several executives from Cochola
and associated companies.The meeting
dealt with complaints over actions :11?
legedly undertaken by CocasCola bots
tling arriliates in Columbia.

Cochola, which had been under
the impression that the boycott was
a Joint Board dccision, requested to
meeting to attempt to tell their side of
the story, Student representatives perrs
odicalry asked questions to Coca-Cola
representatives.

CocasCola representatives tried to
“share information, perspective, [and]
facts as we know them” with the stus
dents about both the nature of the
Coca-Cola system and the events in
Columbia, according to Kevin More
ris, a vicespresrdent at Coke’s principal
Midwest bottling affiliate.

Morris also said, in an e-mail mes
sage, that “the boycott has negatively
impacted..." the sales of the Ames
based company “[This] may impact
our employees [who] live and work in
Iowa," He hoped that once “students
learn all of the facts the boycott wrll
end because our relationship with rhc
Grinncll students is vcry important to
us,"

The primary incident that moti~
vated the boycott, as well as a current
lawsuit pending in Miami against
CocasCola botrlcrs in Columbia, was
the 1996 murder ofIsrdro Gil, a union
leader, by a right-wing paramilitary
group. Bottling plant mangers in Co»
lumbia havc bccn accused otcoinplicity
in the paramilitary actions as part of an

Coke reps fly in to answer accusations

Students and company representatives meet to discuss boycott organizers’ allegations

attempt to defeat trade unions,

Ono spokesman from the Cocar
Cola family or Companies was Juan
Carlos Dominguez, a legal managci for
Coca-Cola FEMSA, the largest border
in Columbia. FEMSA is not involved
in any of the incidents behind the
lawsuit, but in 2003 purchased Panar
merican Beverages (Panamca), which
oivncd plants where anti-union VID-
Icncc occurred

Columbia, currently in the middle
of a civil war, has
numerous armed
groups in the couri-
tryside, according
to Dominguez,
including both
Marxist rebels,
and the right-wing
paramilitary groups
that have organized
against them.

“If you believe
socially in very
simple things [like
the] redistribution
otpoicrry"Doniiii-
guez said, “you arc scan at a leftriving
sympathizer, and targeted by pammilk
taries."

Dominguez, a Columbian Citizen,
said that because FEMSA refused to
pay protection money to paramilitary
groups, its employees are often tar-
gcted. He described several initiatives
by the company to protect its workers,
including giving tniclt drivers armored
vehicles and cell phones, and helping
crriployacs who are victimized get legal
help,

Dominguez also defended his coma
pany, though he declined to answer
questions relating to the branch ol‘bor-

”A/l oft/re accusations, all oftne
wrongdoing; have never been
placed in a negotiating table Willi
our company They have always
been plated either in the (ourriri
Miami, or in the press,”
Juan Carlos Dominguez,
legal director for CotasCola

tling plants whti-c Gil was murdered
because it was a different company.
Commenting on how FEMSA has
signed annual collccrivc bargains with
its principal unions tor the past sew
oral years, he said that, “All of the act
cusations, all of the wrongdoings, have
never been placed in a negotiating table
with our company. They have always
bccn placcd cithcr in the court in Mir
ami, or in the press,"

After FEMSA heard of the com—
plaints about harass-
ment ofunion meme
bets, Dominguez
said, “I personally
went to every facility
involved in the Com-
plaint. I interviewed
cvcry single member
mentioned rn those
accusations. I also
talked... not only to
union leaders but to
the base. There were

FEMSA no serious com—
plaints against our
company," except tor

complaints about salary, working hours,
and other things that Dominguez cats
egorized as usual.

As CocarCola rcprcsciiiativcs made
their case, students asked them quess
trons. Zeke Hausfather ‘05 asked if
Coca-Cola would be willing to release
a copy oran independent audit ottheir
dealings in Columbia,

“1 was concerned with their inability
to release” the reports, Haiisratber said,
in rcsponsc to Coke claims that rhc re-
ports had to remain private for the time
being because they were tied up in the
lawsuit filed against Coke bottleis.

on his racrics of OIlC’OIl’OIlC chtIngs
wrth members. “In this country, at least,
a standard practice for management
to...bieak workers is to have one-on-
one meetings,"whcrc workers are often
less likely to admit complaints.

Lori Billingsley, a director from
Coke‘s othce ofCorporate Media Rela-
tions, clarified the nature ofCoca-Cola’s
structure in response to a question from
Omondi Kasidhi ‘05, “Our bottlers are
independent companies," Billingsley
said. “We do use the franchise model
in that if you arc in Columbia..[you]
have certain standards, Coke mnnw
facrurcs the concentrate used in the
product and provides marketing supr
port. The bottlers...take the bottles to
the market." Coca-Cola does have an
ownership stake in many ofits bottlcrs,
including FEM SAr

Students and company representas
trves expressed satisfaction with the
meeting. “I thought the meeting went
very well," said Hausrathcr, a member
of Students Against Sweatshops and
the Latin American Solrdanty Group.
“It was a good discussion." However, he
said that he wished Coke would have
provrdcd “some evidence that what
happened in Columbia was not their
responsibility."

Midwest Coca-Cola BottlrngComs
pqny's Kevin Morris said it was a “valor
able dialogue." It was the “first oppor
tunity for us to share our understanding
of facts"with Grinnell students.

SGA President Mark Henry ‘05
invited thc CocasCola representatives
to return to the campus for an open
forum. “\’Ve'ie definitely interested" in
an open forum, said Morris. “We look
forward to continuing the dialogue,"
