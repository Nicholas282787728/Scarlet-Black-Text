UNIQUE GAE PLANNED

Irish Five Will Meet a Cosmopoli-

AfternoonﬁGhdllenge Made by
“Swedes.”

The basketball season became ti mat-
ter of history last ilonday evening

when, at the homo of Captain B. J.
Carney. Vilah Eagau was chosen to
lead the basketball team for next year.

The banquet to the team by the re
tiring captain has become an annual
affair ﬁnd this year's “feed" was an
especially delightful alfair. Besides the
squad, Coach Brown. Trainer “Tufiy”
Smith and Scott MacEachron were
present to partake “of the eicellent
four-course dinner.

Captain Carney officially closed the
season and called on Hopkins tor a
few remarks. seott illoclsachvon spoke
brieﬂy and voiced the sentimc'lit of the
crowd when he said “a season is sue
cessfiil any old time that we beat low-a
twice."

Eagan‘s election was not unexpected
as he has been a strong factor in Gilu'
nell's athletic Learns all the time he
has been in school and his election to
the captaincy was well deserved. At
the beginning of the season few ev-
pected to see “Red" develop into a star-
guard but now he ranlrs among thc
best guards iii the state. lie is a
fast, aggressive plarcr and has out
played his opponent in practically c --
ery game. The election was unar
malls and everyone looks forward to
seeing “Red’s" team more good
showing.

Will Take On the Irish.

The grand ﬁnale of the basiretlidil
season will he the ii-ishCosmopolitan
game Saturday after-noon. No single
nationality felt themselves capable of
coping with the wearers of the Slialir
roclr, so they combined forces. The
result is a very formidable aggrega
tion, which should give the Pats and
Mikes a close rub.

The game will be called at 2 30 Sat
nrday afternoon and an admission ore
of ﬁfteen cents will he charged. Tire
proceeds will go for tho purchase of
new varsity baseball suit. Tire for-
eigners are nuignaninrous and wish the
proceeds of their exhibition to go for-
the support of the great outdoor game.

down by the local organization. The

the concluding concert of the ReciL’il
Coiirst last_Satui-doy evening, playing

printed in

SCAnLET A D BLACK.

The ﬁrst number was the tenth
Sonata by Haendel, a striking example
of the classic sonata composition. )1
makes tremendous demands on tech-
Alique, but is showy and formal, re,
thcr than impassioned. The second
number, Romanza by d'Ambi'osio, was
in strong contrast to the first number.
it is relatively easy to play but has
warmth anti passion. The accompani-
ment is very beautiful and furnishes
a fitting setting for the lyric melody.

Tarantella Very Difficult.

Scherzo Tar-entellc by ivierriawshi.
was the most brilliant and difficult
number on the program, The Tar-on-
tcllc is it Spanish dance, and the
music has caught the spirit of the
swirling movement, constantly decals
crating iii tempo, in a wonderful man-
ncr. it did not exhibit many iovi
s licrzo qualities, but these few served
to temper the fiery character of this
mad (lance. As an encore alter this
group Mr. Peck played the simple
Melody b ole Brill. This is one of the
few coruposi ons of the great Scandi<
naviau violinist, and is one of the
most beautiful melodies in all violin
literature. Those who have heard Mr.
Peck play this number- many times sax
that he never played it better than he
did at this time.

The Adagio from Haydn‘s c major
Concerto was another example of elas-
s formalism. However, this com-
poser is always in a jovial mood and
all his music has a smooth, flowing
quality which makes one forgive him
for his lack of passion. The cadenza
by lilengel was considered by some the
most interesting port of the number.
The fiavotte b d. S, Bath-Burmestcr.
, an adaptation from Bach‘s Sixth
Violin Sonata, originally composed for
violin without accompaniment, but
was airangoil iii its press-it form by
Euimcster, a modern t-Ciltzi't violinist.

Mozart Minuett Beautiful.

Mozart’s iltnuoit was considered
in many to be the most. delicately
beautiful number- on the program. In
the cjvlrenrr llliish necessaiy lor biins»

the matter of technical difficulty with
