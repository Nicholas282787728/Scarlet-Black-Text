sionnlly throughout the semester
for campus bands to play in.

Regarding the Harris Center's
Cinema, I think a new projector is a
necessity. A picture that ﬁlls up the
entire screen would greatly improve
the ‘real movie theater’ effect. I
also think the Harris Center should
show films at least once during the
week, perhaps Wednesdays.

The movie showing times dur
ing the week end should be altered
as well. Rather than having a 7:30
featurcat Harris and an 8:30oneat
the Forums have the onc at the
forum start at 9:30. This way the

walking to the bar.

The area in the Harris Center
used to serve popcorn during films
can be used as a Commissary in the
late cvcnings. This idea is implcr
rrtcntcd at other schools, in which
economics majors gets hand on

cxpcriencerunningtheirownbusi-
ncss. This kind of commissary can
be open late during week nights,
open till two or three am. The
students mnning the Commissary
both receive c'rcdits for ninning it,
aswcllasbeingablctomakemoncy,
as they do own it. That way the
students want to work, being the
money they make is their own, and
students on campus pulling ally
nighters can get food at two in the
morning. Ifyou think noonc would
be willing to work so late I would
like to pelnl out KDIC is open till
3:00 am.

More student input for bands
brought to campus. Take IIIIUZILIVCS
to ask which band sludcnls would
prefer to see and let the students
decide.

Most important, more campus
initiatives to decide campus life.
Grinncl] isn't so big that a pure
democracy here is impossible. The
more decisions given to the stu-
dents to decide. the better.

I guess these ideas arcn'tcarth»

more acceptance of all views on
campus, smaller classes, more

Anyway, I am a writcrin candi-

SGA‘s accessibility to the cum-
pus community?

Iccrtainlyhopeso.lwcnttoalot
ofloint Buttrd meetings my first
year here. Last year, it didn't seem
like senators took a lot of pride in
their j0b~lhcy weren't sure ex-
actly what their job With the cam-
pus, as opposcd to just a group of
people voting on specific budgets.
This year, the senators really are
taking pride in their job. They're
discussinga Iotofimponantissucs
that the campus is facing, and
they'reusingJointBoardasasound
board. l think they’re taking their
job seriously; they're asking their
constituents about things. As for
SGA accessibility, we‘ve tried to
hold SGA study breaks in all the
dorms; we plan on doing the same
thin g again probably in late March,
early April. Again, I've been held
ing 14 office hours last semester, 12
hours this semester. I’ve tried very
hard to sack student input. I wrile a
bi-weckly column in the Scarlemrtd
Black to give students a better idea
ofwhat’s going on on a dayrto-day
basis, that SGA is an organization

broad promises. I also had some
very specific promises. Oncof thcm

I've pretty much exceeded that. I

I’ve done a good job.

I can honestly say that I‘ve

Ultimately, you will have to

I am asking that you give me the

DEMOCRACY:

don’t know why we have to have a
representative to decide. It’s not
like this campus is so huge that we
can’t have initiatives on all Issues

Why do you believe that your
responsibililies as a HAC and
your claim that you‘re an “alter-
native cundidate” are sufﬁcient
reasons for your election?

When I announced my candi~
dacy, Pedro was the only one run
ning for president. And I roll that
some people weren’t happy with
the way he did it, so I didn’t want
people drinking they didn‘t have a
choice. So I’m another choice, and
I just want to show that I’m not
joking around. I do have responsi-
bility, and I have been a member of
scvcralcommittees.Soldon’tthlnk
that being a HAC translates into
having the capabilities; Ijusl think
thatbeing a HAC shows thatI have
the responstbilily it takes to be
president of SGA. And I want
people to know that they have an

V alternative, and they can vote for

me.

Because of your involvement
with the soccer team and your
lack of SGA experience, how will
your time commitment affect
your ability to learn and perform
Ihe dulies ul'SGA president?

For the rest of this semester, in
was elected prcsidcnl, I’d have a lot
of ti IHC~I ikc last year, I was on the
baseball team, I’m not on the

baseball team any more. I’d have a
lot oitlme over the course of this
semester to work with Pedro and
SGA to learn the ins and outs of
how to run SGA. And I lhink that
next yearl’llbcable to balancemy
time, and without being a HAC,I
thinkl’llhavemorelimclodcdicale
to being president of SGA.
