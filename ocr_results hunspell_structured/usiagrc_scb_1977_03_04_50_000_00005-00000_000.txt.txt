Candidates: Consider women’s issues

by Ellyn Toscaiio

With SGA elections coming up
next Wednesday, we are afforded
the unique opportunity of
evaluating and comparing issues
important to Grinnell students. In
the fall, a number of issum
mobilized the campus community
(for a time) and initiated a series
of debates between ad-
ministrators. faculty and students

’romises were made, co
mitments professed and certain
remedial actions were scheduled.
Now, five months later, very little
s heard.

It should be noted that none of
the SGA presidential candidates
are women. Consequently. it is
imperative that attention be given
to the importance each of the male
candidates gives to women's
issues, How many of the can-
didates even include affirmative
action. sex discrimination, or

women's cultural and educational
programs in their platforms?

After much commotion over
affirmative action last semester,
the administration set up a coma
mittee to renew the past hiring
and firing procedures of Grinnell
College. As I understood it, an
effective, written affirmative
action policy was to be the
culmination of the committee's
investigationia policy which was
to be disseminated through the
institution.

But now, about five months later,
I have heard nothing of the
committee nor have I seen a
policy. Perhaps the initial en-
thusiasm of the administration to
remedy their past discriminatory
practices has waned~or perhaps
they feel the students are not in
terested in the progress of the
committeeior perhaps the
committee just has not produced
anything yet to present to me
community.

In any case, I think it absolutely
necessary that next year’s SGA
president should be attentive to the

 

problem of affirmative action at
Grinnell. Most schools have 3f,
firmative action programs, many
required by law. The ad-
ministration has agreed that there
is a need for a policy at Grinnell
but they seem to need a little
prodding. To make such a policy
effective, the SGA should take an
active role in writing the polic
in disseminating it and most i
portantly, in monitoring
progress.

The new vice-provost will have,
as one of his many functions,
responsibilities as the affirmative
action officer. Perhaps it would be
useful to him to have an informed
and interested committee to help
him monitor the implementation of
an affirmative action program.
The SGA president should be
adamant about establishing a
permanent committee composed
of students and faculty as well as
administrators. Sex
discriminatory practices will not
simply fade away because of the
good intention of people. Positive
steps must be taken and taken with

its

 

a commitment to change. The SGA
president must take a forceful
stand on affirmative action as it is
the students also who eventually
stand to lose.

One idea which the new SGA
president should consider is a
Grinnell sponsored and hosted
conference on affirmative action
andaor women's studies for all of
the ACM schools. Many other
schools in the ACM are having
similar affirmative action
problems and many already have
established programs. As such, it
would be beneficial to all to get
together and share experiences,
techniques and successes. In»
forming the campus community
and more particularly the ad»
ministration oiwomen’s issues and
problems within the academic
community is a necessary and
very positive step towards the
sort of fundamental change or
reorientation that is needed.

The Women's Center is now
facing a problem that next year's
SGA president must be concerned
aboutarelocation. The Center,

 

presently located in Smith Annex,
has been characterized by inertia
and inaccessibility this year and
now would be the opportune time to
revitalize it. The Center must be
located in somc central and ac
cesslble place on campus where
people can make good use oi it
Time and money are also needed
to be invested to update the Ccnr
ter's resources and establish it as a
viable meeting and information
center for Grinnell women.

The SGA presidential candidates
should and must be Very aware of
women‘s issues at Grinnell College
and must take an active role in
creating and continuing programs
relevant to Grinnell community
women The above suggestions are
by no means inclusithher ideas
should be solicited from all
members of the campus com
munity. Grinnell cannot afford to
lag so far behind other schools in
an area which has assumed
national significance. Much in»
novation and a very strong com-
mitment is needed to rationalize
Grinnell’s policies towards women
and such a commitment must be
demanded of the SGA president.

Do we ask ourselves the right questions?

ﬁrompted by the 5518 series
about the several off campus
programs available to Grinnell
studenm, I herewith relate the
ry of my own off campus
ﬁgram and, more importantly,
the effect it has had on my per-
ception of Grinnell, now that I’ve
returned.

I was not, as some may have
heard, in prison for manslaughter,
nor was I back in Kentucky helping
out the clan in its latest feud. I was
on a program which is not officially
recognized by the college but is
nonetheless required by Grinnell
The program is ”SGA in Exile."

a very large and powerful dose of
the Grinnell “experience."

After catching this dose, I took
flight from Grinnell to seek a cure.
I'll spare the reader all the graphic
and sometimes gory details. I
simply felt that my education and
growth would be jeopardized if I
were to return to Grinnell im-
mediately after the end of my SGA
tenure.

I at first opted to go to London
and try to stomach a diluted
version of Grinnell, but Big
Brother, always vigilant, said no.
After not being allowed to go
across the big waters, an
examination of a map showed the
State of Maine to be about as far as
one could get from Grinnell
without leaving the country. So
that’s where I went.

Actually, physical distance
between myself and Grinnell was
less important to me than mental
distance. Maine served very well
in both respects. In what seems
perhaps to be a perversion of my
purpose, I became involved again
with an educational institution, this
time as a faculty intern at a private
school near the coast,

A description of the school and of

' my activities there would be well

worth hearing (and can be heard
for the price of a Pickett‘s), but
that would be another story. For
immediate purposes, it is enough
to know that my involvement there
was of a gut-wrenching intensity,
and that I had to continously
examine my own beliefs and
justify my actions in light of my
conscience.

After seven months in Maine and
fourteen in the SGA during which I
was constantly preoccupied with
those issues which confront
educational institutions, I’ve come
to feel that, While I can claim no
monopoly upon the answers, my
awareness of what sort of

questions should be addressed by
such institutions has been
heightened. And herein lies my
concern.

The perspective which my stint
in Maine has given to my SGA
involvement is more than a little
unsettling. Rather than having
been involved in decisions con-
cerning the more sublime purposes
of the college, as I sometimes felt
at the time, I feel now that I per
ticipated in the petty and the
mundane squabblings of self
interest.

If I sensed that the meaningful
and notable decisions were simply
being made without any input from
Student representatives, I could
cry “foul” and protest autocratic
decisions, In a sense. however, I
could take some comfort from the
fact that at least someone was
minding the Store, even if I
disagreed with how it was being
managed. I am deeply and truly
disconcerted when it becumcs
apparent to me, as it has, that
meaningful decisons are simply
not being made by any part of the
college. It is not that the college is
arriving at the wrong answers, but
rather that we ask ourselves the
wrong questions ,

We are not addressing ourselves
to those questions which are
crucial to the future of the coma
munity and its members, and
seemingly prefer to occupy our»
selves with relatively trivial and
insignificant matters.

There is no shortage of pressing
issues. some examples: The
monetary value of a liberal
education has certainly been
thrown into some doubt by the

recent and foreseeable job market.
The liberally educated person’s
benefit to society must be
questioned as it becomes more and
more apparent that liberal arts
graduates do not seem to make
better citizens or leaders than
people who have not been blessed
with such an education (Witness
Dean, Ehrlichman, etc). If
nothing else, simple demography
will force us to take a hard look at
the service we provide to an over-
shrinking collegevage population

Clearly, the times are such that a
fundamental reevaluation of our
purposes as a college is in order,
but we do not seem up to the task.
We have many times demon-
strated our capacity to understand
other institutions and other
cultures, but we demonstrate no
similiar procilivity to understand
ourselves. We show no reluctance
to doggedly pursue the truth so
long as that truth could not
possibly be unsettling to ourselves,
We do not seem willing to lead the
examined life, if the life under
examination is our own,

If there is blame to be
distributed, there is certainly
enough to give each of the college's
constituencies a large share. The
largest part necessarily goes to
that part of the college most
responsible for the nature of the
colleg . he faculty,

I don't Wish to place myself in the
uncomfortable position of defen-
ding the administration's actions
or inaction, but it Seems clear to
me that the administration is
ultimately powerless in the face of
the faculty. if the faculty decides
that something shall occur. it
occurs. If they decide that
something shall not occur, it does
not. If there is a lack of direction in
the college, or a fuzziness of

 

purpose, the responsibility lies
with the faculty.

After witnessing many faculty
meetings and after having dealt
with them concerning matters of
college policy, I can state that the
traditional student disillusionment
occurred there for me. If the
liberal arts education is supposed
to impart some respect for what is
right and true, for the critical
examination of one‘s beliefs, and
for service to others, it has found
poor custodians at Grinneli

My criticism of the ad
ministration is that they lTurner,
Walker, Tederman, and Eysen-
bach) seem continually willing to
settle for second best from both the
faculty and the students. It seems
to me that the most important
function of the administration is
not that they make decisions, but
that they demand that the faculty
and students step up to and resolve
the questions which face them.
Certainly they have not done this.

We are supposedly about the
business of debunking myth,
eradicating falsehoods, and
educating people to the truth. But
we protect and defend our own
sacred cows against criticism as
fervently and irrationally as Bryan
defended the creation theory. We
throw up a smokescreen of verr
biage capable of preventing even
the strong light of reason from
penetrating our institution. We,
who are supposedly the cutting
edge of knowledge, seem to fear
the truth.

A more serious indictment of a
liberal arts college would be hard
to come by. It is difficult to justify
Grinnell’s conslimption of society's
resources if those resources are
used only to subsidize mental
masturbation and academic
acrobatics.
