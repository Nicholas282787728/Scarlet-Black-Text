Cornell Wins!

The fourth annual debate be-
tween Iowa College and Cornell
College, held at Mt. Vernon last
Friday evening, again resulted in
a victory tor Cornell by the unan-
imous decision of the judges. The
debate was strong and spirited
from beginning to end. Both sides
showed a thorough knowledge oi
the subject, and olten quoted irom
personal interviews and communi»
cations with the best authorities in
the country. All the speakers,
with the exception of the last reg
ular speaker on the negative, were
not dependent upon manuscript
and used only brief notes. Iowa
College afﬁrmed and Cornell cler
nied the question, which \vasstated
as follows:

”RESOLVED, that immigration
into the United States should be
denied to all who cannot read and
write the Constitution of the Uni»
ted States in some language,"

Prol.Richards.orowa City.act-
ed as presiding ofﬁcer. Thejudges
were, Chancellor McClain, orolva
City; Judge Deemer, at Red Oak;
ProfessorStanton,otAmes. Each
speaker was allowed 17 minutes,
and each side seven minutes for
rebuttal.

Morton M. Macartncy, of Des
Moines, was the ﬁrst speaker, He
outlined the policy ot the nFﬁrma»
tive as not one of opposition to
immigration in general, but that
the proposed test is simply a cone
tinuation of the present restriCr
tions, By charts he showed that
the bulk ot immigration into the
United States is from southern
Europe, that a large percentage of
these immigrants are illiterate and
that this class isyeally increasing.
He proved that the illiterate inl-
migrants congcst in the slum disr
tricts, do not assimilate, and are
too ignorant to appreciate the bal»
lot or the public schools, and thus
are undesirable and menacing to
our country.

W. R Persons, of Rentvick. was
the ﬁrst speaker on the negative,
He contended that the question
was whether this test was best from
the standpoint ot social selection
and social discrimination, and
pointed out eight objections to this
proposed test which the aﬂil'mar
tive would have to remove to sus~
tain the burden oi proot. He

showed that the educational test
is unwise and unjust, because it is
a test only for illiterates; has no
rational content; makes a differ-
ence without discrimination: is a
masked design; in its practical ape
plication would separate lamilies;
would stimulate evasion ot inspeo
tion; is an unscientiﬁc method of
selection; and fails to mcct the
real difﬁculty.

Robtr L. Parker, of Gilmall, the
second speaker on the afﬁrmative,
showed at some length that the
illiterates are economic evil,to the
illiterates themselves,to American
labor and to society in general.
He illustrated this by the deterio-
ration ot the garment making
trade. owing to the inﬁue of illit»
erate immigrants, which has re
sulted in the present sweating sys-
tem, The second poillt was that
the illiterates are defeating the
success of local government by
their dependence upon the boss
and the small Contractor,and their
congestion in the slum districts.

C. V. Gilliland, of Mount Vere
non, the second speaker on the
negative, said that the education-
a| test was not only unwise, but
the height of folly, because it ex-
cludcs an honest and industrious
man simply because he could not
read and write. He claimed that
the sweatshop is simply a stop
ping stone to the factory system,
and only coexists with immigrar
tion but has no connection with it,
He stated that there was a great
demand all over the country for
unskilled laborers, and by numer-
ous charts showed that immigrar
tion does not lower the standard
or wages,

Everett K. Campbell, of Des
Moines, the last regular speaker
on the afﬁrmative, said that the
atﬁrmatives had proot that the il-
literate immigrants were not only
doing no good. but were a positive
harm to our country. But putting
the question upon higher grounds
he maintained that for the sake of
the illiterates themselves, it would
be better to keep them out of a
country where they become de-
pendent and helpless. Thcspeak.
er showed that as the steamship
companies arecompelled to return
rejected immigrants at their own
expense. the test would be selfr

 

operative and thus would not re-

 

sult in hardships or separation at
lamilies. As a deﬁnite ﬁnal test
it is practical and desirable.

C. C. Nye, or Creston, the last
regular on the negative, asserted
that nonassimilation was a myth,
and that our civilization needed
an inﬂux of new blood from the
romantic races of Europe. By
charts he represented that immi»
gration is not conducive to paus
perism and crime, that the immi-
grants go west instead of into the
slum districts, and that illiterate
races are decreasing in city popur
lations.

In rebuttal tor the negative,Mr.
Persons maintained that the pros
posed test was unwise in that it
would exclude desirable ilrlmi-
grants and that it was unjust in
excluding the undesirable, In the
closing rebuttal, Mr, Campbell,
after impeaching the validity of
many of the charts ot the negative,
maintained that this test as a cone
tinuation of the present policy,
would exclude a harmful and un»
desirable element from our counr

try.
