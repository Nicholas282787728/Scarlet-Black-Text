WASHINGTON DAY EXERClsES.

Appmp lets Services are Held in College
Chapel--Addresses by Professor Par-

ker and Hon. N. E. Kendall,

The chapel was ﬁlled to overﬂowing
onThursday morning by an audience oi
students and townspeople, who had
gathered to do honor m the lirsb great
American, This was the LirsD time in
the hismry of Lhe college that. a. me-
morial service has been attempted and
it. was entirely successful. All recita-
tions were suspended and nearly every
one was present at the services, which
lasted one hour and a half, In the
evening a large crowd was present at
the informal recepcion given in the
Library.

The chapel was prettlly decorated
with the college colors, scarlet and
black. and with ”Old Glory.” On
the platform were seated the speakers
of the day, Professor L, F Parker,

Hon. N. E, Kendall, of Albia, Dr. E.
W. Clark of Grinnell, Dr. E. A. Steln~
er, onfessor Noble, and G. M. ci-abb.
'06, chairman of bhe day. The services
were opened with a prelude on the or-
gan. MeyerbeerrBesb “‘CD re 1: ELM oln
March," by John Ross Frampton. The

Cardinal Quartette then sang “Lead
Kindly Light, afber which prayer was
ulIered by Dr. Steiner.

Mr, cisbb then introduced “The
Grand Old Man of Iowa College," Pro-
iessor L. F. Parker, who gave what
was pronounced hy all tohai-e been
the best speech delivered from that
platiorm in many a day. His subject,
“The Iowa Band.” iiasatimely one,
and the students received a new vis-
ion of what Iowa College stands tor.
In spite oi his eighty orlri years, Pro.
fessoI Parker-spoke with an enthusi-
asm which was remarkable. We are
only able to give extracts oi his speech
but hope to publish it in lull in the
near future.

"The college like the poor is always
with us. but Washington's birthday
comes but one a year. In this short
time, my words must be scrappy. In
1838, white man’s Iowa was live years
old, and at that time they began to
ask for sell-control. In congress they
were considered rooms and one sena-
tor proposed to appropriate money to
be used in prosecuting them.

At that time Asa Turner, in, or Fa-
ther Turner, as he is now called, was
living at Denmark, In the election of
1554, Turner wrote the party platiorrn
on which James W.Grimes ran for
governor. It was clear, terse, straight
to-the-point, and a better one never
was written in state or nation,

or. this time some Yale men were
discussing plans tor a western college,
and at Andover plans were being
iormulated. The Iowa Band was or.
gcnizcd and came to the state in taco

of great dangers and hardships. In
the words of Father Turner, “Many a
bill of lading had come before, but the
goods had alwaysbeen lostonthe way. ..

 

Among the men who came were, Dan-
icl Lane, the upostleJolin of modern
Dimes; A. B, Robbins, more than ﬁfty
years pastor at Muscabine, and father
of Secretary II II. Robbins: Ephraim
Adam, one of the two survivors, and
Still a. college trustee; William Salter.
the youngest member, who has been
for over 60 years pastor 21L Burlington,
and J. J, Hill, who gave the ﬁrsb ler
larior Iowa College and whose sons
have given thousands, and more is ex~
pected,” [Greatapplause].

The audience then joined in Singing
the college song. composed especially
for the occasion by Dr. E. A. Steiner,

GRINNELL DEFEATS IOWA.

The Scarlet and Black Team Wins From
the Old Gold in Fastest Game oi
the Yeah

Before a crowd oi iii-o hundred en.
tliusiastio routers, the University has.
ket Ball team met deieaton Thursday
evening at the hands at the Grinnell
quintetr. Score 20 to 19, The teams
were evenly matched and it was a
toss-up as to who would be the winner.
Grinnell showed superiority in throw-
ing baskets but, on the other hand.
was lamentably weak in throwing
iouls. not being able to score asingle
point. Grillith tor Iowa was very re~
liable and threw tools with a painful
regularity during a greater part of the
game. The game was last and tree
from all wrangling which has marred
$01118 contests.

The game started with a rush and
it was several minutes before either
side scored Finally Wilder made the
ﬁrst basket for Grinnell and, when
the hall closed, the locals had secured
six to three tor Iowa. The score at
the end or the ﬁrst hall stood Grinnell
12, Iowas. . ,

In the second halt the playing. was
more home though not so last. Iowa
was determined be overcome Glin-
nell’s lead and accomplished hei- pur<
pose up to the very last minute or
play, Grinnell secured three baskets
and Iowa two, but ihe latter proﬁted
from awards and Grimth's ability to
throw iouls. In the last minute or
play, Dellaan threw the basket which
saved the day and won the day for
Grinnell. The whistle blew and his.
tory had been repeated.
