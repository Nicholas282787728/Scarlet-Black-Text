Harpists to perform today

Concert will feature Celtic and concert harp

BY MELINDA JONES
Staff Writer

An informal presentation and
concert on Celtic harp will be
given on Friday, November 22, at
7:00 pm in the Forum South Lounge.
Presented by the students of
Grinnell Assistant in Music
Jeanmarie Chenette, the concert is
designed both as a student perfor
mance and as an outlet through
which to experience the rich his
tory and unique musical style of
the harp.

Students panicipaung in the pre-
sentation will be performing pieces
on both the concert harp and the
Celtic harp. Grinnell College owns
one of each type of harps, allowing
Ms. Chenette‘s students the oppor»
tunity to learn the differing tech
niques and styles of both.

The Celtic harp, the smaller of the
two, originated primarily in ireland,
Scotland and Wales. Its sound is crev
ated by plucking the 29 strings, usu-
ally made of either wire or nylon, and
by operating a series of levers used
to change the pitches of singular
notes. This harp was not originally
meant to be played separately, and
throughout history has been used as
pan of an ensemble or as accompar
niment for voice or another instrur
ment.

A tradition of great history can be
traced in following the origins ofthe

Celtic harp. Its importance is noted
in‘maintaining Celtic inﬂuences
through vast changes In the land of
its heritage. The harpists of Ireland
or Scotland “kept oral history alive
through the songs they created," said
Ms. Chenette.

The concert harp has 18ih century
French origins. This harp stands cone
siderably larger than the Celtic harp
and employs 46 strings; pedals are
used to change the strings‘ pitches.
It is used chieﬂy for more Western
European pieces, particularly of
French inﬂuence, as opposed to the
more traditional inrcontext Celtic
tunes of the Celtic harp.

Presently. Ms, Chenette has ten
students. Eight of these students are
studying on the Celtic harp, with the
remaining two concentrating on con-
cert harp. wThe music of the concert
harp can be more complex," Ms.
Chenette said, a factor that may
prompt students to start out on the
Celtic harp. “The historical aspect of
the Celtic harp is also a primary
motivator to learn," she said.

Ms. Chenette herself has only
been playing the Celtic harp for eight
years. She staned out on concert harp
at the age of 14, and went on study
at the New England Conservatory of
Music in Boston, where she received
her Masters degree in harp perforr
mance,

Although she began her experir
ence with the harp on the concert

harp, Ms, Chenette feels that a re-
naissance of the Celtic harp is well
underway. “It is a wonderful new tern
ritory to be explored," she said

Many ofthe students who will be
performing in Friday's concert have
only been playing since August of
this year, “The harp itself is consid
ered a fairly difficult instrument,"
said Ms. Chenette, Therefore, her
students, particularly the beginners,
have been putting in an ample
amount of work in order to meet the
challenge of preparing their solo
pieces for the presentation.

Along with the challenges, how
ever, come the many benefits of
learning the harp. according to Ms.
Chenette. “Harp can be an extremely
therapeutic sort ofmusical medium,”
she said. She went on to point out
there is “such 2| closeness to the mu-
sic. Everything is up to you. There is
nothing between you and the music."

In order to better accommodate
this closeness of music, the concert
itself is going to be rather informal.
“It's going to be in the spirit of a
ceiiigh, a gathering of people where
everyone contributes to what is be-
ing produced, which in this case is
music," said Ms. Chenette.

This traditional gathering form
will also enhance the historical rich-
ness of the music being performed.
helping, as Ms. Chenette said, “the
identity of harp and oral traditions
of long ago to live on."

Stanley Kubrick directedDr.
Stratlgclove at: How] Learned to Stop
Worrying andtove the Bomb. In this
film, General Jack Ripper goes Insane
and implements Plan R, the plan to sig-
nal bombers to drop 1400 lnegatons
of nuclear explosives on targets in
Russia. The military designed the plan
in case the Russians made a surprise
attack and destroyed the chain of come
mand.

The plan made it impossible to Call
off the attack unless the caller had the
command code, a code only in pos-
session ofthe base commander. The

Scarlet or Black . Friday. November 22, 1996
Comic and eccentric, ‘Dr.

Strangelove’ is thought—provoking

plan also called for the commanding
base to go on alert forANY intrusions.
This meant that the military could only
obtain the command code ifthcy lite
lacked the base and forced it from
General Ripper, Captain Mandrake
(Pctchcllcrs)discovcrs Ripper's plan
and unsuccessfully tries to pursuade
Ripper to call off the attack, While
this is occuring, the President tries to
figure out how to avert disaster wttlt
the help of his staff, including Gen—
eral Buck Turgenson (George C,
Scott).

This moyic IS morbidly funny.
Kubrick, who cerwrotc the script, inn
sens hilarious onerliners over the cone
text of nucleardisastcr. He sets up SiluA
aliens and manages to add many funny

twists to them to make an effective
satire. Scott Steals the movie as Gen-
eral Turgenson. Scottplays him with
exuberance and clearly enjoys the part
immensely, Hisravingsmakethewar
room scenes the best parts of the
movte. The scenes in the office of
General Ripper and on one of the
bombing planes lirc not quite as funny.
though Sellers pcrfoims his best.

Kubrick inserts a lot ofcriiicism of
Cold War paranoia and even finishes
the mOVIC With a mix of seriousness
and comedy. leaving the audience to
wonder JUSl which mood Kubrick
wants to ﬁnish with. Dr, Simugelove
