Like the old gray mare, football
“ain’t what she used to be!”
it is just thirtyfour years this fall
since Grinnell played the first game
of intercollegiate football west ofthe
Mississippi, and grimly ran up a score
of 24 to n against a surprised and
chagriued state University.

The State University of lows, in the
autumn of 1889, nonehalautly issued
a challenge “to any team in the state
of Iowa, for a game of Rugby, played
by the American College Association

, rules," and remarked with a bored,
sophisiceted air that they were out
to "bag a few cornfield eanaries-le
just for the fun of the thing, you
know!

Grinnell, then iowa college, prompt—
ly tool: up the challenge, bought a
ball and a rule book, and proceeded
to learn what the game was about.
Lon Vim Gieson, who had played on
a "rugby” team the previous year at
a preparatory school in the East, was
elected captain, and practice began.

There was no professional coach, of
course. Moreover, rulevboolts in those
days were vague, quite inadequate
things, and the various points they
set forth were interpreted in some—
thing of a hit-or-miss manner.

The line-up in the game when the
big day finally arrived was as fol—

From the time Savage made the

factorily in the hands of Grinnell,
1n the last few minutes or play, the
s. U. 1. men managed to carry the
ball within a few yards of the Grin;
nell goal. Excitement ran high;
however, an early account states
triumphantly, “our rush line, with
locked arms, stood like a stone wall!"

There was as yet no regular auto
letle field, and the game was played
in a pasture at the edge of town.

Grlullcll's athletic activity can now
be confined to the state, nor to the
Missouri Valley, nor to the western
hemisphere.

The Grinnellrianhiuzt movement
has introduced American sports to
the stlldunts of Porter high school (ii.
Techow. The stamp of Gl'illnell seems
to be ﬁrmly impressed upon them,
even to the point. of their traditional
rlvitls. According to Paul MacEitchv
ron, dean of inch, who joined the ad»
ministrative staff of Grinnell last year '
upon his return from the Gl‘lllnellrin-

China field, the two strongest rivals.
of Porter high are a Presbyterian
school and a Methodist school. These 1
are called Drake and Cornell by the
Crinnell—in—Chiua athletes.

The physical program for China is
the distinct contribution of western
schools, and is “The most important
of any we - being done in China by',
Americans," according to a statement,
made by Edward Lincoln Smith, of“
New York. He made this statement
after making an extensive tour cm the
country and a thorough examination
of conditions there.

The Chinese idea of a gentleman

was one who never worker}, who Wore
a long coat, and who never cut his
finger nails. Athletics have done
away with the long finger nails, the
long coat and the aversion for hand
work: a national meet, sponsored by
Tsinan University, is heldevery year.
The meet consists of contests in drills,
boxing, games, track and held events,
basket ball, singing, and speaking.
Porter has lost only one basektball
and one track meet in the last nlno
years. /

every boy has to compete in one

rest of the contests are intriL-mul'ali
and the rivalry is extremely keen for
positions on these teams. Last year
lorty boys won team emblems in in-
trztrmlll'al basketball.

A. B. DeHaan, ’05, was the first
man to start athletics in China in the
Grinnelt way. Lee Miles, '0 , Lyman
Cady, '10, and Paul MitCEztchron, '12,
carried on his work, and this year
John Decker, 21, is the director of
athletics at Porter. The lit) and 880
yard dashes, the mile run, high jump,
discus and the relay teams are the
strongest features of the track and
field events at Porter this year, Deck-
er says.

Good sportsmanship is being taught
the boys there and they are succeed-
ing, though at times the Chinese will
go back to their old ways. at one
national meet, a team that had_iust
won the first game in the basketball
tournament by 2!. narrow margin, re-
fused to play any more for fear that
they would be beaten in their next
game. They had their hand, their

‘yells and colors, and pep, yet they

lacked the spirit of being good sports,
and that is what the Americans are
working to teach them.

These national meets are very edu-
cational along other lines as well, as
many of the boys see trains, electric

lights, telephones, and victrolns furl

the ﬁrst time, here. At the last one
only two out of one hundred twenty
buys from one school had ever seen a
train before,

The Chinese boys at Porter, them-
selves, believe in good sportsmanship
for China and they organize play~

grounds for‘priniary schools and act
as referees and umpires for the
younger lmysl Graduallly through
their influence and that of other
American institutions, the oriental
schools will he lifted to a plane equal
to that held by their occidental fel-
loWs in athletics as well as in scholar»

light years away so that he might wit—

from our mundane sphere at that re—
mote epoch, he would he moved to
laughter, nay, to convulsions.

For example, he would see the earl—
iest sport in which Crinnell men in-
dulged, a nondescript mixture of soc-
ccr and rugby that can’t be classified
under any extant form of athletic
competition. A round ball was used.
it could not be touched with the
hands except when thrown into the
field from out of bounds. The aims
could not be used in interference,
but the orthodox maner of taking a
man out was to run into him at full
tilt, This was distinctly a winter
sport, because it was for too violent
for warm weather. Although the ar-
chires are rather hazy as to the exact
year of its introduction, the date is
set in the late ’60:.

The old annals tell us that Charles

Noah Cooper, '67, became so interested
in physical culture that he raised a
small fund for the erection of a swing
west of Alumni hall. Two years later
Mahlon Willett, ’69, contracted the
habit of taking a brisk walk before
breakfast and wlth some difficulty in~
duced a few other early—risers to fol—
low suit.

chiefly to mass play. The flying wedge

style of play, the fact that padding .

was introduced in 1359. The spirit

evenly distributed on both sides. Eli-
gibility rules were unknown for a
long time. Town huskles and an ac-
casional pughaeious professor were
pressed into service.

Judged by our modern standards,
the most ludicrous events were re-
served for the field meets. The rec-
ords of the Grinnell track team that
took the Terra championship in 1393
gives the following illuminating infor—
mation: The baseball throw went in
323 feet; the high kick in 3 feet; and
the mile walk in 7 minutes, 24 sec—
ends.

The ability to ride a swift bike was
one of the most highly prized of all
the forms of manly art. included in
the track events of one meet we find
egg races, potato races. and three-
legged races. Sounds like the pro-
gram of a small town street carnival,
but it was serious business to the ath—
lete of yesterday.

if some of those events look unfa-
miliar, glance at a list of prizes
awarded at the home meet in 1389.
The awards included: Knee pants;
twenty Weeks’ laundry, one dozen
shaves, and a gold lead pencil.

It may be of interest to note that
one relay team was rewarded with ten
gallons of ice cream and another with
one hundred glasses of soda water.
Truly, soda water may have served in
lieu of blue ribbons and gold medals
in that bygone day, but it is possible
that "Doc" Huff might object to a- re—
vival of the custom.

“Tin" Adams, star Tiger half, is
first on the Missouri injury list this
year. Adams broke 3. leg in scrim-
mage with the freshmen last week.
Injuries to other members of the
squad have not been serious.
