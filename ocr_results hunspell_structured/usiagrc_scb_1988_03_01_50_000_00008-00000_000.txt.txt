' Vice-Presidential Interviews

Why are you the best can
didate for vice-president?

Rob Killion _

I‘m the best candidate for vice
president because I have three
qualities that are unique in the
sense that I think other candi-
dates have some of the qualie
ties but I think I’m tlle only
candidate who has all three.
That’s experience, leadership
and, most importantly clearly
deﬁned goals.

Jetir Fields

I’m the best candidate be
cause I’m very determined, I
have lots of ideas, yet I’m willing
to listen to people to get more
ideas. I don’t consider my ideas
the best. I consider them the
best ideas to create more ideas;
substantial ideas to bring to the
administration, to bring to the
students, to bring to son.

Cathy Baldwin

I think there are a couple rea-
sons. The main reason is that I
think I’m the most qualiﬁed. I
worked within and without SGA
for three years and I’ve been
able to get a lot done in terms
of making the student center a
reality and with working with
EPC’s. Right now I’m on a
committee to try and improve
the power and the efﬁciency of
the EPC’s because that‘s really
important in terms of curricu»
lar concerns. I’m very familiar
with many of the faculty, I’ve
worked with all of the admins
istration at some point or an-
other very closely, as well as Stu-
dent Aifairs on a regular ba-
sis. I think because I’m familr
iar with the people I’m going
to be dealing with; I’m familiar
with how SGA functions; and I
know how to communicate with
people, which you have to do

What kind of experience
do you have with the faculty
and administration?

Rob Killion

As a member of cabinet I
think, since cabinet does in a
sense run son from day to day
I’ve had the exposure to the ad-
ministration in ways that other
students might not he exposed
to them, For example, the cabie
net meets every other week with
the Student Affairs deans in a
FDR, where we can share con-
cerns and they can share con-
cerns with us. Not only share
concerns with one another but
develop good working relation-
ships if we work at it. Another
example is I’ve met with Dee
Fairchild, I’ve met with people
like Wally Walker for different
situations. Simply in the course
of being on cabinet there are
times when you’re going to have
to go to someone in the admin-
istration, and it’s usually some-
one at the top if you’re going
to get concrete answers or cone
Crete results. I’ve done that in
the past and I feel comfortable
doing that in the future. I be-
lieve that any administrator I‘ve
ever had contact with has come
away feeling like I’m a reason-
able person to work with, some—
one that they can accomplish
things with. And if these ad-
ministrdtors feel they can work
with me 'I' believe I am able to
accomplish more.

if you’re going to get anything
done on this campus. That qual~
iﬁes me as one of the best can-
didates. I’ve been doing it for
three years so it’s almost second
nature to me now. The other
reason I think I’m the best cane
didate is because I really, really
want to be viceepresident. A lot
of people ask me why I didn’t
run for president, And I think
that the reason I didn’t run for
president is because the types
of things that I’ve always been
concerned with on this came
pus are the academic issues and
the communication issues. My
whole platform is based on com—
munication because I think that
there isn’t enough of it around
here.

It’s a very tricky issue be-
cause how do you deﬁne come
munication? How do you de.
fine how to improve and up-
grade the dissemination of in.
formation on this campus. The
role of the vicepresident is con-
cerned with a lot of things which
involve the communication and
the dissemination of informa-
tion, whether it’s coming out of
Judco, or communicating what
students desire from their de.
partment as a whole through
Curriculum Committee, or just
simply supervising the informa.
tion that comes out of SGA and
making sure that the student
needs are met. I would like
to see some additional training
for senators, standardization of
minutes because sometimes they
are not clear. I think Ali’s ad-
ministration and Liz have made
tremendous efforts, with Greg
Evans in terms of training sena—
tors as to what speciﬁcally their
duties are. As vice-president I
really would want to help to ex.

Jeﬂf Fields

I’ve talked to a couple of pet»
pic, I’ve talked to George Drake
once, I’ve talked to Charlie Duke
once. I‘ve dealt with people
in Student Aﬂ'airs a lot. in-
cluding Jim Tederman, Diane
Dougherty and Tom Crady. I
deal with Steven Jones a whole
lot there. Also, I’ve talked
to my profs. about diiferent
things. I’ve talked to them
about topics that came up after
the Speakeasy, and also topics in
general. I’ve also talked to profs.
about my approach in running
for SGA Vice-President.

Cathy Baldwin

My primary experience aside
from personal relationships I
have with my professors has
come in Faculty Committee for
the Renovation of ARH, Good-
now, and Steiner. That commit
tee is comprised almost entirely
of faculty, there are two stu—
dents and hopefully soon three
student members. Myself and
Chris Gunst, and we will be
initiating a search to add an.
other Student to that commit»
tee. of course that one is sub-
divided into other commrttees
on audio-visual and computing
and classroom spatial arrange-
ments and faculty ofﬁces. There
are' faculty members represent—

amine and to reevaluate a lot
of the current channels that we
have. I think that it‘ll be my
job to continue what has already
begun in improving communica-
tion channels between the stu-
dent body, other student organi.
zations, committees, and those
other governing bodies which
run this college namely Student
Affairs and the administration.
I think that All and Liz’s ad.
ministration has really worked
hard to get regular and efﬁcient
communication between the ad.
ministration and SGA, and Stu-
dent Affairs and SGA. Now, the
remaining part is the student
body as a whole, and that‘s the
most diiﬁcult. That is what I
would like to address as vice-
president, and my desire to do
that is so strong right now it’s
just overwhelming and I really,
really want to be viceepresident.

Stephanie nedman

I’ve had suﬁ‘lcient experience
with son, starting as a fresh
man observer. I was a senator
for two terms. I was on Finance
Committee second semester of
last year, and Student Pub.
lications and Radio Commit-
tee, which is indirectly ruled by
SGA, and chair ofStudent Pub-
lications and Radio Committee,
dealing more directly with SGA
this year, seeing it function, or
not function, as the case may be
sometimes. And I know what
it takes to get things done in
son. As far as working with
the administration goes, which
is a large part of the vice pres-
ident’s role, I have worked with
the administration and I’m very
comfortable dealing with George
Drake, Wally Walker, the face
ulty.

ing all the departments that will
be housed in ARH. There are
a few faculty members that I
knew before I was appointed
to that committee my freshman
year. Over the course of the
three years that I have been
here I have had to work with
all those faculty members in
terms of deciding what was go
ing to go into ARII. I think the
most intimate work I’ve done
is on the subcommittees, work
ing with a few speciﬁc faculty
members and discussing audio
visual needs. I've also had deal~
ings with the faculty on a day-
today basis, for instance in the
biology department. You have
to work together. There is just
no way around it if you want
to get an independent project
done, or anything done within
the department, EPCs or semi.
nars or something like that, I re-
ally am sympathetic to a faculty
position, I think, because my far
ther was a professor, Ihave a lot
of educators in my family and I
have a great deal of respect for
the faculty. I respect their con-
cerns and I also respect student
concerns; we should be work-
rng touard a lot of mutual goals
and that is the improvemcnt of
the education here at Grinnell.
Those are my primary areas of

experience and then there‘are’

Chris Gunst

I think all of the candidates
are good candidates. The (life
ference is experience. desire and
how they stand up against the
administration. We can all say
that we have ideas, I think most
of the ideas are pretty much
the same. Since the SGA Vice-
President is head of academic
aﬁairs, you have to meet the
faculty and the administration
constantly. You also have to
know what your ideas are. You
have to go in and know what
you’re talking about and not
be intimidated by Wally Walker,
or George Drake of Don Smith.
They’re just people too and
they’re ideas are not better or no
worse than anyone else’s. Also
you have to have experience
with SGA. You have to know
how cabinet, you have to know
how to run meetings. I think
the ﬁnal things is, as a mem-
ber ofSGA the difference is how
many people can you get talked
to and get out. If you elect a
president or vice-president you
have to elect someone who can
get out. 1 think you have to
know a lot of people, you have
to allow public forums.

Tom Worth

I expected a question like that.
I think there are several rea-
sons. One is because of my

experience on Judicial Councils

That is one aspect of the vice.
presidential job that is often
overlooked and it is a very im-
portant aspect of the job. I’ve
been on Judicial Coucil for two
years and rm chairman of it this
year. I’ve seen people who are
new at it come in, and Judie
cial Council is very structured
and it’s not easy to deal with
at ﬁrst. It takes a little getting

informal areas, of course, too. I
think most students are aware
that you can make whatever you
want of your education at Grine
nell and that involves taking ad-
vantage of the time that’s avail~
able to you with a faculty mem—
ber and I think I have. I’ve uti-
lized those times to the fullest
because faculty are really inter
esting people and they have a lot
to offer.

Stephanie Redman

Faculty on a onetoone basis.
I’ve argued curriculum and that
sort of thing individually. I’ve
met with profs, as everybody
has. The administration—I’ve
had a fair amount of experience,
especially this year. To start oil,
George Drake was my tutorial
professor, so there’s a good in
there, I guess, if you could call it
that. I’ve dealt with the admin-
istration extensively this year as
chair of SP and R. I think the
goals I’ve set for that commit-
tee and the things we’ve taken to
the administration have all been
achieved. I feel very conﬁdent in
dealing with the administration.

Chris Gunst

I‘ve been a member for two
years of the ARlI/FacultyeStu-
dent Building Committee, which
is direct contact with Wally

,used to, a. little practice. But
when you’re viceepresidentiand »
it’s your duty to take students
to Judicial Council, the learning
by doing approach is not good
when a student’s future is on
the line. With my experience,
I’m very familiar with Judicial
Council, I feel that I can do a
competent job in that respect
from the beginning. I think
that’s one kind of experience
which I don’t think any other
candidate has. Also, I feel I’m
very well qualiﬁed for it because
I’ve seen this campus from sev-
eral different perspectives. I’ve
seen it as a student, as a stu-
dent advisor and as a hall ac
tivities coordinator. The na-
ture of those jobs has prevented
me from being on cabinet but,
on the other hand, it’s put me
very much in touch with student
opinion and feelings. .I’mvery .
well in touch with how students
feel. Especially as a hall ac-
tivities coordinator, I know how
to organize both large groups of
students for allecampus parties,
and also leading a small group
of people such as my hall activi-
ties committee. It’s up to me to
get them motivated and to help.
I’in also working with the ad
ministration now to change the
position of IIAC a little so it’s
more attractive to students.

In the way of more direct ex-
perience as vice-president, I’m
on my department’s Educa~
tional Policy Committee (EPC)
and I’m the committees repre
sentative to the Student Council
on Curriculum, which the VP.
chairs.

Once again, that involves me
directly with academic issues.
It’s like Joint Board of academic
issues.

Walker, George Drake and other

.faculty and administration. I’ve
also been a member of Commit-
tee on Student Life which deals
directly with Student Affairs. I
think I have the same amount
or more experience with them as
anyone else.

Torn Worth

My most direct experience in
dealing with the faculty is in my
educational policy committee.
indirectly, as I said, just some
other committees 7 well, Judie
cial Council has faculty mem—
bers, but the point of it is not to
work with the faculty members
in coming up with agreements
with them. It’s more we’re
working together for a different
purpose, which would include
Judicial Council, Public Events
Committee, and AlleCampus 7
well, All-Campus Events Come
mittee has administrators on it:
the assistant dean of student afr
fairs. And as a Hall Activities
Coordinator, 1 had to work with
quite a few people in organizing
an allecampus party the magni.
tude of the James Hall Ball. I
had to work very closely with
student affairs. I had to work
with the treasurer’s ofﬁce. I
had to work with B and G. So,
