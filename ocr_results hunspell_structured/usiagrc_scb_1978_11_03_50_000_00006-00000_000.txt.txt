Trustees cautious

(continued from page I)
to support it

Unless he hears otherwise Irom
the committee, Maytag says he
votes according to his i‘ecomr
iiiendation.

Till: PROXY resolutions. said
Anderson, usually seek to prohibit
corporations trom having business
transactions iiith governments
such as South Africa which are
charged wtth human rights
Violations.

Anderson said the proxy
resolution Introduced at the IBM
stockholders meeting typitics the
shareholder’s resolutions acted on
by Gi'innell. The resolution called
on IBM to investigate Argentina,
Brazil. Chile and Uruguay to see if
their governments used IBM
products to abridge human rights.
The resolution also urged IBM to
develop criteria for sales which
would minimize the potential for
abuse of IBM products by
authoritarian regimes,

RESOLUTIONS SUCH as these,
Maytag said, are “utterly imr
practical.”

“Generally speaking, they were
very broad and very poorly word-
ed. . . and really inappropriate.
There aren’t any governments that
aren‘t authoritarian except that
you can count on one hand," he
Said,

HOWEVER, CLOSE examin-
ation of the proxies reveals that the
IBM case is an extreme example.
Other resolutions seem less
cumbersome. For example, one
resolution calls for Mobil Oil
Corporation to “reduce the volume
of Mobil oil imporB Into South
Africa in 1978 by at least onethird

 

 

ot the average annual volume oi
such imports during the years 19737
l977."

Student interest in tllC issue of
investment policy regarding South
Africa appears to have lessened,
both Maytag and Anderson agreed.

"I WOULD say there were hall a
.dozen Interested students who
came each time there was a new
proxy issue brought to the cam
pus's attention," Anderson said.

Maytag said he sees a
“relatively broad interest" among
students in investment respon-
sibility. But he said he received
only three letters trom studens
advising him how to vote on proxy
resolutions last year.

“I TOOK TIIAT to mean they
were too busy studying or there
may not have been much interest
in specific votes," he said.

SGA President Greg Youtz said
he discussed investment policy
regarding South Africa when he
and other student government
otticeis met with the trustees last
month. “We expressed our con-
~Cel‘l’l‘. we’re still interested in our
investments there.” Youtz said. He
admits, however, that SGA has not
made recommendations on
specitic proxy votes.

YOUTZ IS disappointed with the
Board’s votes SO far. He does not
believe that all the resolutions
were unsatisfactory. “Many of
them are not at all impractical."
he states. These resolutions “Could
be done Without seriously in»
conveniencing the companies."
The trustees’ Votes, he believes,
indicate that “their bﬁic attitude
doesn’t seem to have Changed.”
