Eightyvone percent of the up-
perclassmen and 71% of the
freshmen feel the main objective
of~prepping is to integrate the
freshman into the halls and col~
legs, and to make them aware
of the opportunities. of college
life. Others think the purpose of
prepping is to make hall mem-
bership more meaningful, ful-
fill tradition, to provide enjoy-
ment for upperclassmen, or unite
the preps. Some felt theeprogram
had no objective.

The general attitude toward
prepping in the eyes of the
freshmen is spirited. ﬁfty per

just traditional. Fiﬁty-two per

seem to feel that this year's‘
program is generally more con-
structive than in years past, but
some of them are hesitant about
the rules which limit the hall’s
control over the preps such as
less swatting and hazing. These
things have in the past instilled
a humility in the freshmen, and
have made hall membership
more meaningful. Some upper~
classmen fear the new program
neglects this purpose of prepT
ping.

After less 'than a week of
prepping, freshmen are display—
ing a positive first reaction to
prepping. Except for a few com-
plaints, they feel prepping is
Worthwhile and constructive.
