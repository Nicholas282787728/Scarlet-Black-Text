Stevens Explains Benefits of Student Commission

In a college like Grinnell there

is little time for looking back
and little room for customs that
are outworn. The challenge of
the present is in every problem,

. past years, some holders
of scholarships have had the
mistaken idea that all they had
to do was keep their grades at
a certain level in order to have
the scholarship continued. “This
is not the case," Dean Duke
emphasizes, “and all holders of
scholarships should pick up the
blanks at my oitice to take
home and have signed. This will
eliminate sending the blanks
home by mail in order to have
them signed."

student body and in the instie
tutional administration, seems
to be that the commission should
be composed as follows:

Two members each from the
present Council of House Pesi-
dents,.League Board, and Stue
dent Council; and two members
.each irom the incoming Council
of House Presidents, League
Board, and Student Council;
plus two members at large who
would be elected by the mem-
bership directed above from
those students who petitioned
the commission for a place on it.
This would mean that we would
have a commission of fourteen
students representing both the
old and the new in student gov
ernment.

The purpose oi the commis-
sion would be to make a re~
investigation of our entire com-
munity life. The method of the
commission would be to call
anyone who it thought could
contribute to the understanding
of the status quo. At the same
time, it would be available to
any individual or group of in-
dividuals who wish to protest
anything in our existing pattern
or to make objective suggestions
as to changes which would
