Reconfiguring the ‘truck stop’ Forum

Forum will go back to old set-up, with self-serve items moving into game room over winter break

BY DAVID KRIST

After several months of complaints from students,
faculty and trustees about the new, less-spacious
configmrarion of rhe Forum Grill conﬁguration, the
Forum will return to an arrangement similar to last
years. The pool tables have already been moved into
the Forum North Lounge, and tables and chairs have
been moved into the former game room.

During winter break. rhc Forum Grill will be rc-
stored to its former setrup, and selfrserve food items
will be moved into the current game room,'l‘he entire
arrangement will stand until the opening of the Cams
pus Center in the fall orzooo.

The “living room style seating of last year will
return," said SGA President Mark Henry ’05. “SGA
heard a campus cry for a return to the original."The
result of this discontent was the formation of an ad—
hoc committee comprised of two faculty members,
three staff members, and six students.

Member of both the ad—hoc committee and the
Dining Services Committee Davis Hart ’06 stated
that the current “gas station arrangement” was con-
trived last spring by the college administration with
“the input of neither students not faculty We are
all now suffering because of the poor decisions of one

This week's Joint Board proved to
be one of the most controversial so far
this year.

Bruce Barnum ‘05, formerly a cane
didate for Student Government As-
socmtion Vice President/President of
Academic Affairs, appealed an Election
Board decision not to hear a grievance
officially filed a few hours after the
closing of the grievance period for the
SGA VP tunoffclection ofOcr. 29.

In the runoff, Barnum faced former
Student Services Coordinator Rebecca
Miller ‘05 after they both advanced
from the initial pool of ﬁve candidates
voted on the previous Wednesday

Though joint anrd eventually
voted to uphold Election Board’s decir
sion not to hear the grievance, the issue
provoked nearly an hour or debate ad-
dressing the timchue of the grievance
filing and the behavior ofthc filers and
Election Board.

Barnum had read a random rant
in the Oct. 29 SEE about a glitch
in Blackboard that prohibited some
students from voting. Barnum said
that he talked to olhel students while
campaigning door-to-door and found

> “about four or five other students” who

had similar problems.

Students who logged on u) the hair
lot and then left the page to read states
merits of intent were unable to submit
their votes when they returned to the
ballot page. Administrative coordina-
tor Mike Maloney loo acknowledged
that sortie students who tried were
unable to vote. He said four students
who had been locked out contacted
the Election Board account and were

let back in. However, 13 students who
were locked out were unable to vote in
Friday's runoff.

According to Barnum, he left for
Minnesota and emailed a grievance
concerning the voting issues to Matt
Johnshoy ‘06. The email was sent
around 7 pm. Saturday night. Johns
shoy amended the grievance and took
it by hand to the SGA ofﬁces shortly
before the grievance period ended at
midnight,

“Every year [Election Board] has
been sitting in the SGA
ofﬁces until midnight
waiting for gricw
ances," Johnshoy told
Joint Board Wednesr
day night. He referred
to the SGA bylaws Ar»
ricle 111, Section 3 part
B which states “the
Election Board may res
ceivc written complaints
regarding the election
procedure it delivered
to the Election Board chair within 24
hours after the election was held." Ac
cording to )ohnshoy, he thought that
meant delivering a hard copy to the
SGA offices.

When he arrived at the SGA of-
liccs, no one was there. Maloney larcr
said that he was at Hams when Johns
shoy attempted to dclivcl his grievance.
He crnailcd Maloney from the ofﬁces
saying that he had a grievance and was
in the ofﬁces. Maloney responded to
Johnshoy's email shortly after 1 am,
although he says he received the email
shortly after midnight. Maloney’s email
asked why there was no electronic copy

“It wasn’t an
issue of the con-
tent. It was an issue
of whether it had
been filed on time.”

Election Board

attached. At about 2:30 Sunday mom,
ing Johnshoy checked his email and
wrote up an electronic copy and sent
the attachment to Maloney at 2:38.

Sunday night, Maloney called Elecs
tion Board together to discuss the
grievance. Maloney handed out both
a copy of the grievance and the time-
stamped emails from Johnshoy. While
they were able to look at the copy of
the grievance, Election Board member
Sarah Moss ‘06 said the body did not
discuss the actual content of the griev-
ance. “It wasn't an is-

sue of the content,"
said Moss. “It was
an issue of whether
it had been ﬁled on
time." After about
an hour of discus
sion, the body do
cided no grievance
had been filed.

When asked why
he had distributed both
the emails and the con,
tent of the grievance at the same time,
Maloney said it was because he had as-
sumed that the body would determine
that the grievance was legitimate.

Shortly after, an email was released
to campus announcing that Miller had
won the runoff. Barnum decided to ap-
penl his grievance to Joint Board under
the Bylaws which allow candidates to
appeal the grievance to that body if
rhcy believe that “Election Board has
acted improperly,"

Johnshoy and Barnum argued that
because previous Election Boards had
been available to receive handrdcl‘in
ercd copies in the SGA ofﬁces, some

member

leniency should be given for (he rardy
filing.

Moss said that grievance process
was fair. "The democratic process gives
everyone on campus, including candi-
dates, a chance to file a grievance," she
said. “Everyone has equal access to the
guidelines."

When asked to specify she referred
to the SGA Constitution and declined
further comment. The SGA Constir
rution and bylaws are passed out only
to Joint Board senators and 50 copies
were printed this semester. The bylaws
containing grievance procedures were
not available on the SGA website at the
time of the election.

Johnshoy also asked if Maloney
knew what previous election boards had
done. “I don't know," Maloney said.

“I thought I knew procedure, and
procedure changed," said Johnshoy,
who has been actively involved in SGA
and Joint Board since his first year.

Some senators asked for leniency in
light ofthc ambiguous grievance filing
procedures. “We are being really nits
picky," said Max Bmucr '07, a senator
for Cowlcs, Norris and Dibble, “Should
we really value time over rhe democrat-
ic process>"

“We have to follow the technicalir
ties," snid Erica Williams ‘06, nnorher
member of Election Board, “[Thcy]
make the democratic process."

“We can't place more importance
on some rules than others," she said in
a later interview with the SEE

“The rules are there for a reason,"
said Anne Salomon ‘05, ACE Coordir
hitter and Election Board member.
