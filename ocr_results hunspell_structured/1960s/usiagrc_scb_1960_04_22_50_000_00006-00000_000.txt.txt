The programs currently Con—
iionting Grinncil are not unique
Colleges and universities naton»
wide inustgcope with students
coming from an amorphous
secondary educational system
which, for the most part, imparts
little mental discipline and sex»
ousness of purpose to even its
best graduates, And it is with the
goal of molding these best grade
uates into socially and educar
tionally mature individuals that
this article will attempt to dis—
cuss some of the problems that_a
very good college must solve in
order to become even better.

The Grinnell college com-
munity can be viewed through
its academic, its social or its
iresidence halls system. The
major area of socal and cultur-
al events and the informal
spontaneous contact between
and within the sexes,

In regard to clubs and activi-
ties, the college has two respallsir
bilities. The college should pro-
vide within reason adequate lac
cilities and opportunities for the

students to explore their diverse
interests. This generally is being
done.

Secondly, the individual stu—
dent should be encouraged to
participatc in at least one such
group or activity,not only to
broaden his interests but also to
furnish a meaningful relaxation
from his academic rigors This is
a matter of concern, because lor
example, 30 percent oi the wom-
en don't belong to at least one
organization, according to a re
cent study.

The organized social and cul-
tural events constitute the sec-
ond sphere. The Social Calen-
dar committee’s policies in dis-
tributing the studentssocialfce
could he re-examined in several
areas. As there are never two
events occurring at the same
time, the plamiers of a specific
party or dance know that they
have a captive audience" re-
garding those students who
wish to attend some sort of
planned activity for the eve-
n-ing. As a result, little ingen-
~ iousncss and originality is often
shown in many at the activities,

The second problem comes in
providing for the non datei as
well as the datei in the student
body. Under the present pro—
gram the inaiority of expcn.
tures are.loi- activities only at
tended by couples. or the all—
campus events only the foreign
ﬁlms are ever attended by none
datcrs. In addition, most or the.
money allotted the individuall
halls is spent on “date" allai ,

Strange as it may seem, the
area ol civil rights is one ol
the most neglected and misunr
dcrstood aspects of the Ameri-
can political scene. Owing to
the particularly striking racc
problems, we iiiimediatcly assoc
ciate civil rights with the posi—
tion of the Negro.

However, the field embodies
any violation of the 14th.
amendment, especially. the
‘ "due process” clause. Perhaps
the major charge for such un~
awareness and gross neglect
of the total problem lies
equally with the press and
