‘Vicious Circles’
(Ian Be Stopped

by Jack Swanson

The great percentage of the
world's peoples live in economr
ically underdeveloped nations-
nations whose problems of un-
derdevelopment and resulting
economic impoverishment seem
to pcrpetuate themselves. This
perpetuation of national impov-
erishment in these states is
caused by innumerable ideolog-
ical and material factors that
make the path of economic slice
ccss in development one of near
impossibility.

impediments to the climb
are the vicious circles of nov~
erty, the growth rates in pop—
ulation that eat up any in—
creases in national output that
may have been secured, thc
lack of educational programs
to train leaders for an eco-
nomic a d v a n c e, insufficient
supplies of capital to make an
economic thrust from the un»
derdeveloped status, and the
great inequalities of wealth
that prevent a balanced and
dynamic economy from devel»
oping.

If the rugged path of economr
in growth can be followed to the
terminus of advancement, tlie’se
impediments can turn into bula
war-ks of economic strength, and
the vicious circles of poverty can
result in circles of progress of
a dynamic economic
These generalized problems are
fairly universal in underdevel—
oped states—they hinder lndia
and indonesia, Cuba and Camr
bodia, Peru and Paraguay, Viet
Nam and Venezuela alike. in
all economically deﬁcient states
there is a stirring in the hearts
of the common man for advance,
and here lies the challenge of
the free world to aid them to
an advanced economic status.

The underdeveloped condi-
tions in the majority of the
world’s states perpetuate them-
selves through the economical-
ly detrimental vicious circles
of poverty. The most serious
of these vicious circles is one
in which low income leads to
low production, which leads to
low investment, which leads to
high consumption and low
savings and then leads back to

low income. There are Several ,

other vicious circles of pover-

ty, all of which demand a
great thrust to be able to se—
cure economic growth. This
thrust must be internal to in.
sure sustained growth once
the growth becomes realized.

However, the growth. that
comes economically must battle
more than merely these vicious
circles, For instance, in India,
which is now in the midst of its
second Five-Year plan, there has
been an economic growth in its
gross national product of an
average of 35 percent per year
since 1950.

Ostensibly, this growth looks
encouraging, and it appears that
mold is on the roarl to econom-
ic progress; however, while the
gross national product has been

Program For
Foreign Aid
Given In '59

by Dixie Harrington

It is unique in the history of
the Congress of the United
states that a ftl‘slrterm con.
gressman should play so im-
lportant a role in redirecting a
imajor program as Congressman
Chester Bowles, the lowest—
ranking member of the House
Foreign Affairs committee, did
in rewriting manual security
legislation in the last session of
Congress.

He wrote the new statement
of the purpose of ll. 5. forc-
ign aid; he worked closely
with Sen. Fulbright, the chair—
man of the Senate Foreign
Relations committee, in ad»
jusling the money amounts,
language ard organization of
the bill to further that pur-
pose; and he made the crucial
speeches explaining the need
for those changes.

By April 20. 1959, while the
Mutual security bill was still
in the, early stages of drafting
committee, it was apparent that
in the attitude of Congress to.
ward the foreign aid program
was becoming increasingly du»
bious and that some harsh crit-
icisms and deep cuts in amounts
were in the offing.

There were strong sentiments
for across—the—board, percentage
reductions, which paid Little
attention to the different value
of different programs within the
foreign aid bill, and which
seemed to asume, that the pur-
pose of foreign aid was to buy
friends, and that if they couldn’t
be bought they shouldn't be aid~
ecl so much.

It was in this atmosphere"
that the friends of foreign

by “applying the surgeon‘s’
scalpel instead inf the meat
axe." They pointed out rela-
tive values of specific pro-
grams and called for “New
Directions in Foreign Aid,"
. as Congressman Bowles cn-

titled his speech of April 20.

in that speech he set forth
four changes which should he
made‘ in the Mutual Security
bill.

The first was a revised state-
ment of purpose. The preamble
to the basic Mutual Security
act of 1954 implied that it is
“the policy of the United states
to Continue” giving foreign aid
“as long as (the Communist)
danger . per l' and that
the purpose of the aid was to
oppose that danger.

The change was made. Con-
gress adopted a new pre—

i The second change be pro-
posed was that military aid
ishould be given only to those
nations which needed it to deter
,Communist aggression and not
ito nations where it leads to
internal and regional conflicts.
A beginning was made toward
this.
1 Thirdly, Bowles proposed “a
sot of standards which will give
high priority for technical as«
sistance and development loans
to nations which will demon-
strate a willingness to sacrifice
in their own behalf" and which
“can use our help with a mini»
mum of waste." '

the third change. The De—

policy instrument that we
have organized in recent
years." But it will not, he cons

long—term program, not de~

appropriations.
Congress, however, rejected
this proposal, and its adoption.

Despite the disappointmentsl
it was still a small triumph—if
