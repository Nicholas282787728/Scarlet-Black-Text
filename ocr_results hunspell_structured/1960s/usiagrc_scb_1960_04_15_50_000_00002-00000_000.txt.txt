“The Problem Is In The South"

 

”People who live in glass houses slloilld not throu"
stones" is '21 good philosophy to keep in mind, but it slioiildl

not be carried overboard.

At the Student council meeting; \\'ediiesday, sevelal
students expressed concern that action might be talien to
help iii the southern integration issue when _ milal' situa-
tions e
chided.

in spite of the strength of the support “lilCll may
eventually come from Gi'ilinell, it \1olild be worthless and
.en ridiculous to direct that support to areas in the

The problem is in the South. There ale thousands
at people 1\ith millions of dollars supporting the tight loi
ci1l| rights in the South. T'heie is the local point. Where
is 1\lie1'e, if (irinriell really “ants to do some Good, the
funds alid support will be directed There Grinnell’s few
hundred or even thousand dollars will help a big mores
ment to get bigger. \lhat possible oood could no do, at
this particular time, ill the Nor'th.

We hope that the race relations committee, the Stun
dent council and the students 11“] seriously consider this

situation before they become too sell Conscious about tlleil i

Once upon a time there were
a group or boys at a small 1iheral
alb‘ School somewhere in America
who got sick of iistituiion"

down and searched for a wa to
bring wholesome, tasty moi cis

with only potatoes to kccp their
1minds going Amazinglv. they
found a method which could do
this, and they went to work on
it.

The first step was to estab-
lish -,i ”smiling Bob" center at
which they trained young men
to administer their program.

PAROLES

by Al Stanley

My rirsl thought this week
was to say a few words on
Sheldon Zitncr's new play "The
Thumb," which will be pr seni-
cd this weekend by the GIMP
nell Players in ooiiiiin~rion with
the Fine Arts Festival. How
ever, after further consideration
it was decided that rather tl121nl
harmfuily preiudicc those at
you who happen to road this,
1 would better expcnd the space
"the thcatcr or ideas” in gen-
here with a loner discussion or
oral and “the COMEDY of
ideas" in particular, 5

F st, then. asyou may al~ I
re-iiy know, there are two .
inaj r classifications or “thea-
tel'" about which we usually
talk: the representation of an
action—{ind the representation
or an idea.

The molar concern in the foul
mcr sort is to represent in
some manner 21 series of events
in time, in which the objects
of the play niuvc. change and
thcrchy effect each other and
the envirmiincnt as a whole,
in the representation or
action. the characters are
motivated mainly by personal
need itlmt is to say, by Indir
vidual characteristics with which
cach pcr ii represented is
equipped to meet the given
circumstance,

in the representation of an 1
idea, hoi ver. it is quite a 1
different otter. in the first 1
lilocc, the characters are us-
iiuliy not representative 1111'
persons but rather are air
stractions of a certain facet
of an idea. in short, they are ,
symbolic devices with which ‘
the playwright endenvnn's to
convey his “idea,“

Secondly, the characters are

not motivated merely by [heir
individual characteristics 1011;1I‘cli
the tullillincnt or a pcrsoncl
goal but the puppets in thcl
hands or the p1aywright in thei
cnsc that ilicy are motivated
in the main by the concept or

This is not lo say that the
which they are I'Epl scntativc,
characicrs in this kind r play
act outsidc the usual motiva-
tional bounds but rather that‘
it is the playwright Job to roc-
oncilc his symbolistic device
with cas . recognizable motive
tiolial ii2iis in order that his
characters can be readily under-
stood'alid accepted by the audi-
cnce as approximations of ical
people (or animals, whichever
the case may be),
we are confronted by some

To ﬁle Editor:

Apparently the “Specml Easter
Show" of the “KC Jamboree"
(Tuesday, 576 pm) hcard this
past Tuesday has stll d up
tunic a hit or controve . From
numerous phone calls and r2»
marks that we have received. it
is eyldent that the opinions cons
ccrning this show are about
equally divided

Many concede that it
or the best shows ever heard
and arc clamoring to hear it
again. Othtrs reel that it was
in poor taste. They believe that
was a poor thing to play
the air.

Tonight at 7:15 the controver-
sy hill be debated on KGRW's
“Limbo" show. All interested

ould submit opinions and call
in tonight so that an roles may
be formulated as to how the
students lliink.

As to why

he has said in essence that his
play is above all supposed to

Nonethcic, we, as audience.
must keep in mind that "the

willing, perhaps, to settle tor

willing to concern ourselves pro

level of the pub, the gig, the
