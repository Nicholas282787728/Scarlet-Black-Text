Brooklyn Conference Learns De’rails
OT Governmen’r Civilian Air Train

Details of the Civilian Pilot Train .
ing aet were presented to the
members of the Brooklyn confer
ellce by Ray Gustafson, sophos
more resident of Clark hall.

The purpose of the act, said

Gustafson, is to tram students of ,

universities, colleges, junior Cole
leg-es. and similar institutions to
fly a plane in order that the gov-
ernment will have a greater re-
serve of available pilots should
war he declared.

it should be strongly emphasiz-
ed. he pointed out, that those who
take the course are in no way
obligated to enlist in the flying
corps in peace time or war time.

The program provides that each

student shall pﬂy a $40 fee for /
which he will receive 72 hours of ,

ground instruction and a flying
course permitting him to takc the
test for a private pilot's license
The fee includes insurance

It should be noted, said Gustafs
son. that the average training
course costs $6.50 per hour of
flying instruction without ground
instruction or insurance

Requirements for the govern—

ment course are that candidates
must be between the ages of ls
and 25 and without previous solo
flight experience. The govern—
ment recommends that freshmen
not enroll.
. The biggest problem that we
are facing, continued Gustafson, is
that Griunell does not have a
nearby air-port. The nearest gov-
ernment licensed field is at Mon»
tezuma, nearly 22 miles from the
campus.

The suggestron was made at the
conference that a meeting should
be held for the students to allow
them to discuss the project. The
date for such a meeting will he
announced Saturday. Present at
the gathering will be Grant 0.
Gale, associate professor of phy<
sics, who will explain the program
in detail and answer questions
about; it, and William Pedersen,
president of the student Council.

mg on the “Voice of Labor", Dr.
Luccock declared. “We cannot live
on realistic social fiction alone.
but must find a place in our mans
tal and spiritual outlook or we
become refugees trom reality."

He emphasized that the appear-
ance of a new labor literature,
ionowing a period when the new
i-asthenic school of postwar de-
cadents concerned gin and sex, is
very significant It is hard to
overestimate and is of immense
ethical and religious importsnce,‘
he declared,

‘Much or this lltel'amu‘e was
lived before it was written. Most
of tv . writers are young and they
write what they know intimately
and painfully." he explained.

During the course of his ad-
dress. ancock turned toward
agricultuial labor and gave short
reviews of Several hooks by welt
known authors pertaining to the
agiicultural problems.
