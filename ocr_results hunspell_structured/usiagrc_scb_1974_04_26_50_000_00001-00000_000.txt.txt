, SGA Fails To Reconsider,
Will leaslr Dogs Today

Despite heavy attendance and ani-
mated discussion by Grinnell Coll—
ege pet owners, the Joint Boards
Wednesday declined to reconsider
the leash law for dogs approved at
last week's meeting.

Beginning today, all dogs within
the boundaries of the campus (de-
fined as Sixth Avenue. Tenth Ave-
nue, East Street, and Park Street)
and all oft-campus college-owned
residences) must be on a leash.
The policy will remain in effect

/

for the remainder of the year.
A Fevf?

Several pet owners said that there
were only a Jew dogs causing tro-
uble, and that it would be unfair
to leash all dogs in an effort to
control those few.

Dean of Student Alfairs Jim Ted-
erman said he had received about
100 complaints about Grinnell dogs
-» 80% from members oi the cam-
pus community and 20% from Grin-
neu town residents. ,

He said the complaints included
reports of dogs rumaging through
garbage, jumping on children,‘and
chasing cars and bicycles.

Registration

Tederman added that there are an
estimated 30 dogs on the Grinnell
campus, but that only 40 of these
are registered.

SGA was not representing students

that SGA had done its job by appro- >

ving a leash law.

Hirsch told the meeting, “Some
people feel physically threatened by
the dogs on campus. SGA has fin»
ally taken a stand for people.”

Following more than 30 minutes
of discussion, SGA President John
Hansen asked if any .loint Boards
member who had voted in favor of
the leash law wished to make a mo-
tion to reconsider the action. No
motion was made

Other Action

rights section of the Student Hand-
book concerning privacy was expr-
essed last week in the form ofa mo-
