and well-supported.

The case with which Mr. Lauri
don performed was evidence of a
developed range and good tonal-,

Mr. Blatt, accompanist and mu-
sic coach for the trio, displayed
excellent musicianship in his
renditions of Beethoven’s “Rondo
in C,Sharp Major", and “Valsc

This combination of talent re-
sulted in an unusual and highly
