only hope that they have the good
grace to restrict their wiring jobs to

used fire escapes

What gets me is this. How, if ﬁres
can be contained within rooms and
halls are sysrematically cleared of
ﬁre hazards such as wastepaper,runr

ning shoes. and anything else the av7
erage college student might be ex»
pected to leave there, do the hallways
present such a serious threat to safety
as to merit the expenditure of
$650,000? Truth be told, I am not
usually one to harp on about govem-
ment regulations infringing on per-
sonal liberties - they are often genu-
inely designed for the common good.
But when they become ridiculous.
one must speak out about it

One must also ask why they were
ever devised. These regulations are
changed all the time, and it would

surely be appropriate for some offi—
cial justification of why changes are
made. Is it matter of pork»barrelling
for subcontractors? Or is there a real
need for all of this pamphemalia? I
would really like to know.

For now, we simply have to live
with the law. Soon we will get used
to perpetual gloom and not even no

were. After lots of false alarms re-

For someone else it might be

weekend

nodding intently at your rapidly-told
life history, he’ll probably be scan-
ning around the room for the nearest
exit and the closestfriend to whom he
can legally (according to strict social
drinking mores) pawn this babbling,
slobbering idiot. So be careful.

My mother would be proud of me
forthisactionlShe’sbeenafterme for
a while to quit drinking so much.
Especially after my ﬁve weeks in
Germany. My idea of culturing my
self was to try as many different lo-
cally-brewed beers as I could. I did a
pretty good job, too. (Well, heck, it
would have been rude to not follow
local custom.) But there‘s nothing
more embarrassing than going to a
restaurant with your mother. down-
ing a few Heinekens, and listening to
hcr claim that she’s consumed more
becrinthepasthourthan shedid allof
last year. She makes me feel as if]
should be dragging my alcoholic butt
to the the nearest detox unit.

But I don’t have a drinking prob—
lem. (My counselor says I may be in
a temporary stage of denial. but I
doubt it.) Iknow my limits. It's just
that I often choose to ignore mem.
Sometimes you WANT to have that
feeling that your legs won‘t move of
their own will, so your friends have to
drag you home by the arms, flop you
down in your bed, and take off your
shoes which you Lied while in your
incbn‘ated state with some sort of
knot you learned in the Boy Scouts,
making itimpossiblc for your friends
to untie your Shoes, so they simply rip
them off your feet, not that you‘d
notice, because you‘re already passed
out and drooling on your pillow.
There’s no feeling in the world like
waking up with cotton mouth and a
hard, crusty, pungent stain on your
pillow.

So, now that this is notan accurate
description of my life, what am I
going to do with myself on week-
ends? Well, for Lhebricf time thatl’m
here, I‘ll most likely just go to the
parties, sit back, and watch others do
what I once did so well. When I get
back to Germany, who knows? I see
myself retreating into a hermit-like
existence, devoid of human contact. I
see myself staying up until 3:30 or4
am watching live hockey telecasts
with a bowl of popcorn and a Diet
Coke, silently (so as not to wake
anyone in the apartment complex)
screaming obscenitics at the refs.

Of course, anyone who's seen me
at a party thinks I‘m lying, but it’s
true, I really am a shy, quiet person,
happy in my state of solitude. You
never really saw me at the parties.
Youonly saw what] wanted to be that
evening, what I thought I could be
only with alcohol. Now that I know I
can be a complete idiot without the
alcohol, I have no reason to drink.
