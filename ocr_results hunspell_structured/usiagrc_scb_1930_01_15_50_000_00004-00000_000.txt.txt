in 1923 and Harlan Miller, columnist
on the Register, in 1929.
Produced Jointly

The Prudities are being produced
for the ﬁrst time this year under
the joint cooperation of Sigma Delta
Chi and National Collegiate players.
While the former has taken charge
during the past two performances of
the Prudities of both dramatic and
business sides, mis year. in accord-
ance with the idea of centralizing all
dramatic productions under the
Dramatic council, the journalism
fraternity has given over the drsm-
atic side of the annual revue to sup-
'ervision by the Players, retaining its
interest in the production by taking
charge of the business end of the
Prudities. Mrs. Sara Sherman Prye
or, director of drsmatics, will aid the
National Collegiate players in 511p
ervision of the forthcoming Alircoi-
lege revue, but the responsibility for
writing the plays or skits and pro-
ducing them will rest on the dorms
and cottages. working together, as
usual.

“The Very lidea" with Frank Cm-
Ven, Solly Blane, A Radio produc
tion. Appearing at the strand to
night, Thursday, and Friday.

A clever. sophisticated comedy
about eugenic babies. if We’ve never
had an opportunity to rave about
the beautiful Sally Blane, you will
forgive this digression. Her voice
records well and the lovely curve of
her forehead and her eyes and . !

And of the auditence who have

maternal will delight in the result of
this eugenic “arrangement." Not in
the least vulgar.
"Hollywood Revue" with MGM
stars product n. Appearing at the
Strand Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
and Tuesday.

A picture that has received so
much attention that any comment
we might voice would be reminiscent
of others writings. All the stars

ception of Greta Garbo say their lit-
tle piece. John Gilbert and Norma
Shearer do a modern version of the
balcony scene from “Romeo and Jul—
iet" Jack Benny is the master of
ceremonies.

The scenes introducing the song
“Orange Blossom “Time" are shot in
Technicolor, in which the Albertina
Rash Ballet do a beautiful inter.
pretative dance. No plot at all; you
are the audience, a relief after these
night club pictures.

“The Night Parade" with Hugh
Trevor. Dorothy Gulliver, a Radio
production, appearing at the anion—

‘ial tonight, Thursday and Friday.

The only thing we know about this
picture is that it is directed by Mal-
com St. Clair and has several beau-
tiful chorines in it. You will recall
Dorothy Gulliver as the heroine of
the "Collegian" short subjects.
"Navy Blues" with William Haines,
Anita Page, Karl Dane, an MGM
production. Appearing at the Colon-
ial Saturday. Sunday, Monday, and
Tuesday.

Holmes has given the Navy a break
new and, actually spends some time
on the ship. The remainder of the
picture he spends in the delightful
company of Anita Page.

The best shot of the picture is
when a street walker greets Anita
with a "hello, dearie." Anita's un-
awareness is beautiful to watch. Her
acting in the “break away” scene is
better than we thought she was Cap<
able of.

The theme song is good and the
typical cockiness of l-laines still dis-
mists one for the first six reels un—
til he undergoes the usual seventh
reel transformation or his ergo perr

sonna.

“Anna Christie." Greta Garbo‘s
first talking effort is finished and
in the can. And the suspense—ev-
eryone's waiting.

We Look in Rudy Vailee's "Vaga-
bond Lover," ”Show of Shows,” “The
Marriage Playground," "Sunny Side
Up,” ”Pointed Heels" and a few
more during the vacation, It will be
a real privilege to review some of
them.

Valley Basketball

Both the Oklahoma Aggies and
Creighton report optimistically on
prospects for a highly successful bas-
ketball Season, as the dispatches be!
low indicate, The Aggies outstand-1
ing triumph to date has been their
victory over Oklahoma. last week,
while probably Creighton's only sup-
srior in the valley is Washington,
conceding Grinneil the position of
dark horse at present. Grinnell
meets Creighton at Omaha next
Wednesday night. and here on Feb.
7, while the Pioneers face the Ag-
lgies on Jan 31 here and on Feb. 28
at Stillwater

Stillwater, Okla, Jan. 15 (Special) 4
Despite the fact that his basketball
,team came through with a crushing
‘victory over the highly touted Okla-
homa University quintet last week
"Gloomy " George Rody is far from
satisfied with his basketball team.

Following the upset of the univers-
ily boys Rody stated that his men
got a lot of good breaks, and that
due to the fighting spirit displayed
by the stillwater crew, and the cool,
heady work of Captain Garwin
Fleming, on the defense. the Aggies
were able to pull through the tough
game.

Rody explained that his unexpectg
ed starting lineup of John Collins and
Joe Ley, forwards, Jakle Harrison,
‘center. and Jim Choate and Captain
lFleming at guards, was due to thel
\fact that Oklahoma started a lineup
of men well over six feet tall.

With a Collins. Ley and Harrison
combination working at the shooting
positions it is necessary to use a slow
breaking offense. This is the style
of play that Rody advised for the
,Sooners. if the farmer boys use a
fast breaking offense it will be neces-
sary for the new mentor to place
Bill Krausse and Dayton Williams at
the forward positions.

One of the brightest features of
the Aggie offense was the fact that
they worked the bail cautiously into
enemy territory, and did not shoot
wildly at the basket. Most of the
counters were
quarters.

Omaha, Nebr. Jan. 15 (Special)

Wee Willie Worthing, Captain
Louie Trautman and Maurice Val»
Ackeran are the three Creighton uni-
versity basketball forwards upon
whom Bluejay fans are pinning their
hopes for a Missouri Valley confer-
ence championship and an undeteab
ed season.

Captain Trautman, a veteran hoop
artist and two-letter man, is looked
upon as one of the most polished
forwards ever developed by Coach A.
A. Schabinger, Wortblng and Van
Ackerman, both sophomores, have
been battling it out for the other
regular berth, and it is expected
that the three men will divide most
of the work at forward during the
season. i

Worthing, an all-state high school
forward in 1928, playing with Tech-
nical high in Omaha, and Van Acker-
man, starring for Creighton‘s preps
the same year, was placed on the
all-city quintet.

that has been augmented by freshmen
of last year and by several “finds"
from the intramural meet.

0f last year's freshmen,
John Thomas is perhaps the
outstanding addition. having done
consistently better time
back»stroke than was turned in last
year. Alfred Conard has been de-
ing the 200 yard breast stroke in
good time consistently. Sid Skoug
and Chuck Woody in the shorter
sprints have been turning out for
practice regularly and may be seen
in the coming meets. Jimmy Davis.
who failed to appear for varsity
swimming last year. but who won
second in the inter—class meet has a
good chance of being a member of
the team which participates in the
first dual here, on February 3.
