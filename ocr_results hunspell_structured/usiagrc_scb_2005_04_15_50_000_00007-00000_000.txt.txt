BY KATIE JARES

Bill Menner may he just a name to
most Grinncll College students, but
in town, he’s akin to a local cclcbi'lry.
During ornn hourrlong interview with
the 5:51;, over 20 people walked hy,
and Menner gleeted each one of them
by name. Several people stopped and
talked, while others iust aid . quick

best, and they’ie all
trite."

Menner moved
to Grinncll in 1990
with his wife, Barr
haia Trish, Political
science, whom he
met while studying
journalism and po
litical science as a
graduate student at
Ohio State Univer—
sity. While Trish worked hurt-,Menncr
commuted dttily between Gtiniicll and
Cedar Falls to work at the National
Public R dio station,which aired from
the University of Northern Iowa. For
the ﬁrst ll years he lived in Grinnell.
L'lennci said he ‘ w n't all that visible"
in the communl .

That all changed in 2001, whcn
Menner became the ext itive dimer
tor of Giiiiilcll Renaissance, a new
paitnu hip comm ioncd hy the city
in c nitrate and rcV' 4c downtown
Griniicll. Grinncll Renaissance has ll

Though Giinncll may not seem
like the ideal touiist )wn Menner
said selling Gi'inncll ‘ ior hard at
all" because of the moon of historic
buildings and small town charm which
he believes result in the perfect blend
or heritage tourism.

the world are familiar with the bank"
The Merchant’s National Blink was
designed by ruinous architect Louis
Henri Sullivan and was his second
“jewel box" bank.

According to Menner, the town-
gown relations are better than they've
ever been "It’s ii priority of Grinncll
Renaissance to draw more students
downtown," Menner said. “We want
Grinnell to feel
like a college town.
