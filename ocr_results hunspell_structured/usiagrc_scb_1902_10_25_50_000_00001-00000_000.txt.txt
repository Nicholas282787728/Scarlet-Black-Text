THE DES MoINEs GAME.

Grinnell Wins Her First Game rStar
Playing or Fuller.

The ﬁrst game on the home
grounds resulted in a victory for
Iowa College over Des Moines
College by the score or 30 to 0.
Five touchrdowns were made and
ﬁvegoals kicked. On the whole
the gamewas ratherunsatistactory
as to the showing made by the
home team. They did not play
the game they can play, and
would probably have put up a
much better article 0! football if
the goal line had been in danger
at any time. Loose playing was
noticeable on both sides and spec-
tacular plays appeared galore.
ThreetimesFuller,the short guard,
emerged trom the bunch and ran
down the ﬁeld for touch-downs.
once tor a run Oithirtyrﬁve yards.
The onepoint in which Des Moines
excelled was in punting. How-
ever. Grinnell seldom failed to
gain by punts because the Des
Moines backs were unable to re
turn them.

The Des Mnines team shows
great improvement over their
playing or last year. They are
able to stand much faster work
and show much better team work.
They were a manly lot of fellows
and did not stop playing when
they saw they were beaten. They
all swear by Coach Fiske and it s
very evident that a happy choice
was made when he was secured to
take charge or their athletics,

The ﬁrst touchdown was made
in ﬁve minutes’ play. Atter that
slow work was done unlil near the
close of the half, when two touch-
downs were made in short order.
The second halt was cut up some-
what by time being taken outuntil
it was so dark that it was hard to
follow the ball, and trequent puntr

ing tent the play from one end of
the ﬁeld to the other.

to give us a message from the
wealth of their experience and

eminentiy such a manmhe is the
exponent or a principle, and what

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 25, [902.

THE FALL MEET,

Handicap Meet is Successful in all

Except Attendance 7 Events

Were Close.

A very small crowd was in at-
tendance at the fall meet held
this morning at ward Field. The
day was almost ideal tor such an
event. A few scattered clouds
were present in the sky while the
strong south wind aided the run-
ners of the hundred yard dash
who ﬁnished at the north end of
the stretch. The remaining races
were ﬁnished at the south side of
the grand stand.

The meet is valuable in that it
gives new men experience and
old men a line on the new materi»
al available. Fall training is a
necessary requisite for the winter
work in the gymnasium; it puts
men in good condition tor the
early spring work. Every man
who goes into themeet and trains
will feel better and be stronger
for future events. The new mar
terialshowedup well in all the
races. Withjack's training the
boys should develop into consis-
tent athletes and help advance
the record of Grinnell in track
athletics.

All the events were not run off
