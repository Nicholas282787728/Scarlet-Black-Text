very little.

That origin, as taken from
.a letter to an alum, Mary
Stimson Gates, ’18, is as fol-
lows: “The 1915 YWCA presie

the suggestion irorn someone
on the social committee I do
not remember. We held .our

dining room with candles to
light the tables. home made
candy and turkey. .

“Then we gathered. 300 strong.
in the drawing room President
