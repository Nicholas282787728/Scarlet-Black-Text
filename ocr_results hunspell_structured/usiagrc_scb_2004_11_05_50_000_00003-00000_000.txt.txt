Colombian union organizer recounts
terrifying experiences at Coke

Student from Colombia questions groups’ methods and speakers’ accusations concerning Colombian government

EV LAUREN STANDIFER

On Wednesday, Nov. 3, guest speaker Luis Adolfo Cardona
gave a talk in the Forum concerning the activities ofthe coca
cola company in Colombia. Cardona and many human rights
organizations accuse the coca-cola company ofcollaborating
with paramilitaries to squash attempts at union organizing in
their bottling plants. Cardona, as a union organizer in one such
Colombian factory, almost became a casualty of this violence.
The talk was conducted in Spanish and translated into English
by Marcos Rubenstein.

While working to organize a union at the carepa coca-
Cola bottling plant, Cardona received death threats and orders
to leave the country constantly. He said that it was no secret
that the plant manager had relations with local paramilitary
groups because plant workers would frequently
see the manager drinking with paramilitary
members. In Colombia, rightist paramilitart
ies, some ofwhom have government ties, have
been fighting with leftists guerillas seeking to
overthrow the government.

On Dec. 5, 1996, Cardona was in the fac-
tory when a paramilitary member entered the
plant and shot dead his close friend and felt
low union leader Sigundo Gil, Later thar day,
members or the same paramilitary group sur-
rounded Cardona and ordered them to get into
a car with them so that they could go “talk about
union problems,”

Cardona believed that they would take him to a remote lo»
cation to torture and kill him, so he risked being shot on the
spot and fled,running to a police station. He collected his tam-
ily and two changes of clothes and ﬂed his home, which was
burned down shortly after he left. He ﬂed to the United States
as a political refugee.

The event was organized in collaboration by the Latin
American Solidarity Group (LAS), students Against Sweat—
shops (SAS) and Student Organization ofLatinas/os (SOL) as
a part oftheir ongoing campaign to boycott Coke products and
eventually to and Grinnell’s contract with the company.

Zeke Hausfather ‘05, one of the leaders of the committee
formed with the goal ofgettmg Coke offeampus, said that the
group got 25 percent of the student body to sign a pledge to

“We‘re both Colom-
bians,We both have
suffered from both
sides, from the
guerrillas and the
paramilitaries.”

boycott Coke products in only two days.They intend to turn in
the petition within the next week so that an ofﬁcial boycott of
Coke products in dining facilities can begin.

SOL brought Cardona to campus last semester as well.
jenny Dale loo, the committee member in charge of organizing
Citrdona’s talk, said that the event last year had done a great
deal to promote awareness about the human rights issues sur
rounding coke. “I think it opened a lot otpeoplc's eyes,” she
said.

The committee sees Cardona’s lecture as a crucial part of
the campaign to educate people about the situation. Dale said
that the puipose ofthe talk is “to have a ﬁlst’hﬂnd account of
the violence that is going on in the bottling plants in Colom-
bia.” Both Dale and Hausfathcr believe that Cardona's view is
valuable in the campaign because he can bring

his own experiences to the table,

Cardona addressed many other Co—
lombian issues during his talk as well. He
blamed many of Colombia's problems on
the inﬂuence of foreign countries like the
United States on the Colombian governs
ment.

He also thoroughly criticized the Co-
lombian government as corrupt and accused

them of supporting the paramilitaries that tile
most took his life. “The paramilitary, the army
and the police are all the same in Colombia,"
he said. Cardona claimed as well that the current president
founded a paramilitary group before he rook office.

During the Q&A session Juan Camilo Gonzales ‘05 vehee
mently disagreed with many of the allegations made by Car
dona. Gonzales is also from Colombia and has had personal
experience with both paramilitaries :ind guerrillas there. His
cousin was held for ransom by guerrillas for over a year, while
his aunt, who works for the government in a small town, free
quently recieves death thieats fiom paramilitaries for trying to
protect the rights ortarmers. Gonzales believed that Cardenas
representation ofthc situation was biased and unfair.

Gonzales chastised Cardona for condemning the paramili-
taries without mentioning guerrilla groups like the Revolution
Armed Forces ofColombia (FARC),which Gonzales describes
as Colombia's main problem. He also takes exception to Car—

‘05

dona’s allegations that the government is inextricably linked
With the paramilitaries. “lfI said that all union members are
guerrillas, it‘s the same as when [Cardena] said all the govern
ment and army forces are paramilitaries. It‘s not true." Gonza-
les dcnicd Cardona’s denunciations of the president as misled,
claiming that the president had in fact begun a security group
in response to guerrilla violence which later evolved into a para
military force without the president’s involvement.

Aside from Gonzalcs’ disagreements with Cardona con-
cerning the Situation in his country, he is Critical of the tactics
that campus groups like LAS and SAS have taken concerning
Coke and similar issues. Before the ant'rCoke petitions were
circulated, Gonzales spoke to LAS about their strategy of asks
ing people to agree to boycott Coke products before thoroughly
explaining rhe issue, “You must sign up names after you educate
people, i think,”he said, “because when you sign up you're make
ing a commitment.”

Though he thoroughly supports the groups’ fight against
Coke, Gonzales also said he is opposed to LAS’s involvement
in larger social issues in Colombia, such as the situation with
the paramilitaries and rhe government. “You shouldn't go fur-
ther into the Colombian conﬂict," he said, “first, because you
havent done enough research, second because picking just one
guy who was affected by one of the armed groups is not going
to give you an objective perspective, and third because it dis—
tracts people from what the real problem is,which is coke."

Cardona did not change his stance on the Colombian govr
crnment in response to Gonzales'arguments. “We have very dift
ferent ideas about these issues,but we can’t be enemies because
ofour differing opinions," he said afterward. He expressed little
hope for a reconciliation between paramilitaries and guerrillas
in the near future, and told Gonzales that he could never for
give the paramihtaries for the death of his friend.

Gonzales stressed that in order for there to be peace in C07
lombia, the two sides musr torgive and forget, despite all of the
atrocities that have taken place. He said that he could under-
stand Cardona’s point of view. “W'c'rc both Colombians," he
said.“We both have suffered from both sides, from the glerrilt
[as and the paramilitaries."

Gonzales hopes that Colombians can take up rhc “chal
lenge" of forgiving each other, despite the enperiences of people
like himselfand Cardona.

College environmental coordinator Q&A

Environment, cant. from p. 2

people think about it, maybe we can conserve resources by
say, cutting a minute or two ofa shower. It saves a lot ofwa—
tcr over a year, and it saves a lot of energy to clean that water.
There’s only one thing you can control in your life, and that's
what you do preople could spend a minute or two a day
on recycling, we could save a lot ofwaste. [The administrar
rion] devoted a lot ofﬁnancial resources, and yet pizza boxes
pile up in rhe forum because students don’t carry rhem to the
residence hall recycling rooms.

Q: How many Innrs r/yonr life do you think you're rpmf

A: Oh gecz, My family has been composting since 1 can
remember. That’s just how it wasl wouldjump in the pile.
Kinda unsanitary in retrospect. Burl mean, we always had
the big four or ﬁve toot high pile. and we’d throw it on the
tomatoes in the spring.

Q: Hm diner Grinnt/[Mmfmt [a canon :0”:ng in 24'me if
anatronnan/aifnrndiinrn?

A: Our handling of food waste could improve. Ithaca
College is diverting oo pereerir of its waste from the landfill.
That’s a huge number between composting and recycling.
We don’t have the numbers, but we’re somewhere between
2030 percent maybe. Grinnell has environmental projects
going in most of the categories; we’re just not the leader in
any of them.

Q: Can yrn zirrrriic a Iii/{rig int/ding?

A: It's zero waste, or reduces emissions so much that it

has a neutral effect on the environment. It uses solar panels to
remove energy. It has composting toilets, no water waste from
toilets, so it’s using innovative technology to limit the negative
environmental impacts to zero.

9- Dan: a living bin/ding azrnniiy add [0 21M Ina/imminent?

A: Oh, i don't think they do yet. There are theoretically
buildings, restorative buildings is what they're called, where
they actually send power back to the grid, and are still funct
tional as regular buildings like the Forum here.

A: Yeah, I think I've gone pretty hard on myselti almost
refuse to drive my car now. I'm, like, what will they think of the
environmental coordinator cruising around town, so I think it's
more stereotyping myself This place is small enough that
people know me. 1 don’t think they ﬁnd me a stereotypical ene
vironmentalist,l don't know, I can’t describe myself. I think I‘m
more pantheistic than most people are. Do I feel stereotyped?
Yeah,when1first say I’m the environmental coordinator people
are like, yeah, that’s the dirty hippie that the college hired, but
no, everyones been pretty open. They’ve been pretty welcome

mg.

Q: Do you feel/inc the nation Inga bMimftb: me we: worldin

A: Oh, we lag behind Germany and Denmark, they have
almost 20725 percent of their power from wind energy now,

where we’ve still 2.3 percent. Maybe Grinnell is just a small
model ofthc stateswe're doing good stuff in all areas, but
we’re kind oilagging behind the leaders in the field.

than there ever has been, but we can use a let more. Com»

the forum answer that.

A: The thing I‘ve learned is that 1 have no authority
to trll anyone this is what you should be doing, go do it
What I have to do is go to these meetings and start arguing
and say, you know you’ve been having some issues with rec
cycling. So basically I just need to get the ball rolling. Yeah,
it’s all bureaucracy, thar's how a college works like Grin~
nell. Is that good or bad? It's good that everyone on campus
knows their role, and knows their department intimately
because I could never knew the intricacies of every situat
tion.They know if I told them what to consider, they could
then go and identify the speciﬁcs. Is it bureaucracy? Yes, but
I don’t think that's a bad thing.
