Commentary
Propositions 48 and 42:
Racial Discrimination or
Fair Encouragement?

by Doug l-lodum

Proposition 48 is an academic
idea that has education as its under-
lying theme. For those ofyou who
do not know, Proposition 48 was
put into effect in 1985. Basically.
it states that in order for Division I
and 11 colleges to provide income
ing freshmen with the opportunity
to participate in athletics they must
fulfill certain requirements. These
requirements included a 2.0 grade
pointaverage in certain core classes
in high school and a minimum of
either a 700 on the SATs or a 15 on
the ACTs. The passing of this
proposition resulted in a tremen-
dous amount of protest. College
athletic coaches felt that the stan
dardized~test scores discriminated
against blacks.

Proposition 42 was another at-
tempt to enforce academic require
ments upon incoming freshmen.
However, in its original form, it
tried to disqualify students thatonly
satisfied part of the Proposition 48
requirements and therefore would
not be eligible for any academic
aid. However, this extreme move
caused an unbelievable amount of
friction anti unrest among collce
giatecoachesandsomeadininistra»
tors.

Overall, these Propositions are
twocxtrcmely controversial moves
by colleges to f orce athletes to also
be minimal students.

The Lake Forest team came to
party at the Knox Invitational last
year. They did not disappoint this
year either. as a few of them took
the court Sunday morning looking
slightly hungrover. Lake Forest
has yet to play the majority of its
schedule and should be a tougher

This week Grinnell is resting up
in preparation for next Tuesday’s
home match against Simpson and
the upcoming conference champi-
onships.
