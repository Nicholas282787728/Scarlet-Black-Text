WIIIEIIBII IIIIS WEEK

Hey, wait a minute, quit typing Did you see the letter President
Drake just sent out? That‘s right, the one about the $995 increase in our
comprehensive fee, Sure is funny that we didn’t know about it, since we
asked him last week to tell us what the trustees would be doing when
they met over the weekend, We even talked to Fritz Maytag after the
meetings were over to find out what actions the board had taken It‘s
hard to believe, all right, but it’s happened again — another communica-
tion gap between the 8&3 and the college administration,

We’re becoming used to such occurrences here, The college has to be
careful about how it presents itself and wants to be sure all people in»
volved in newsworthy events are told about them before any informa-
tion is released, But we can‘t accept any such excuses this time — the
5&3 and, because it is produced by them, the students also, were not
told that this significant increase in the cost of a Grimell Experience
was going to take place. ‘

By no means do we want to slight the importance or impact of Drake’s
letter but we need to examine the ways college administrators
disseminate information to the students via the 88:3. Finding out about
the fee increase serves as a good example of the roadblocks the 5&8
constantly encounters. When staff members arrange appointments with
administrators, they must explain their intent This is not an
unreasonable request, for it allows the interviewee time to prepare. But
it also gives the administrators time to discuss what information will be
made available

Much of the problem in letting students know what‘s going on at Grin-
nell is caused by the size of the school and, therefore, the number of ad-
ministrators With 1,202 students at the latest count, the school does not
need a large bureaucracy. Instead, the power on campus is concen—
trated in three people 7 Drake, Executive Vice-President Wally Walker
and Dean of the Faculty Catherine Frazer. Not only are most major
decisions made by this triumvirate but they also share the office space
on the second floor of Nollen House. Therefore, they, along with Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Tederman and Director of College Relations
William Deminoff, can easily meet to decide what the campus com~
munity is going to know.

Besides the lack of information given about the fee hike, the college
has been neglecting the students in discussing other issues. Three ex—
amples are the core curriculum, tenure decisions and the Computer Ser-
vices shake—up. In the first case, students believe they are being allowed
no voice and that the Nov 23 open forum was merely symbolic. And only
members of the Executive Committee know why Assistant Professor of
Philosophy Dan Magurshak was denied tenure last week. In the com-
puter case, information was given only to SGA leaders, S&B editors and
the KDIC new editor. And a luncheon with these people, held by Walker,
Tederman and Deminoff to discuss the firings of Mark Grundler and
Dave Renaud, could be described as worthless at best,

These are only a few examples of the lack of administration-student
communication and we‘re sure there are many more. Yet how to solve
the problem is tricky, Sure, the 8&3 could spend more time trying to
force those in the administration to say more. And students could try to
arrange more meetings with the administrators. But they could simply
continue to withhold information and exclude students, Maybe just mak»
ing both groups aware of what’s happening will be enough, If not, Grin-
nell will continue to be, as one recent graduate described it, “the most
bureaucratic school of its size."
