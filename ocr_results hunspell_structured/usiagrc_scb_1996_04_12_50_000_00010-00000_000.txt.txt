Orinnell’s fortune was not

his team showed a lot of heart,

against Coe‘s stellar pitching staff
was encouraging, highlighted by
Shoemaker's grandslaln that tied the
game at 8—8.

The Pioneers' long—awaited
home opener against tlae Figbtmg
Scots ofMonmotlth should also be a
tougb test. “The games against Mon.
