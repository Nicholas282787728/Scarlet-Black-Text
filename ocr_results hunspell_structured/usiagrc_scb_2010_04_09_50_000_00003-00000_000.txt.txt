Campus train incident

Br KATHERINE CHUNG
on Thursday Marsh 18, the College sent
earnpus— -wide e—rnail informing students that
arwin Manning’ 13 was injuredg while attempt-
g to board a train running ugh campus.
rudents dispersed for Spring Break ﬁlled with
ncemirlty about Manning’s condition
Kane Balser’lS and Manning were
ovie for the upcoming'litular Head Film Fer
E111. Mnnn' ngjumped on the train after watch-

g Balset ,urnp on and oi? the train successfully,
recording to Manning. Even though Manning
anded on the rnilwsy ear with ease, he begm to
use his balance

“I was riding on the train, but then my right

oot got really uneven and the second my right
oot started shaking, before I knew it I was on

e gtorrnd,"M.uaning said.

Manning‘s right leg had gotten stuck be-

veen the brain's ladder and car. As a result, his
eg twisted while his body fell hadnvards and

ded on the ground natt to the train tracks.
alser quickly pulled Manning away from the
cks in order to prevent further injury and dis

ed 911.

Manning's leg was, however, severely irn-
acted ﬁom die fall and received a planar break -

E1 both lower leg bones.

“While I was grasping for air i looked down
And I saw my foot and it looked very. how
should we say, very strange. I: wasjust hanging
thereveryloosely, Manningsaid

Despite the severity of his‘ injury. Manning
'ed his best to keep composed after falling.

“The ﬁrst thing i did was 1 saw my Brook»

yn Dodgers hat on the ground and I picked it

p and started dusting it 05 and put it back on,"

arming said.

Soon after, the ambulance arrived and aims-
orted Manning to Grinnell Regional Medical
enter, where a hospital helicopter ilew Man-
' to the University oflowa Hospitals in iowa
ity'l‘here he underwent emergency surgery at

1 a.rn., underwent another surgery the follow—
ing Monday and received Care until his release
n Friday Maren zoMennin then stayed at the .
orne of Naney Maly—the ormer Director of
Admissions last year—until last Saturday when
a returned to campus

Manning explained thar initially, there was a
ig possibility that his leg would have to he ain—
mated. Both his tibia and ﬁbula were shattered
om the fall. Underneath the mysterious blan~

t that Manning has been sporting as of late,

 

a fixator device with six pins hold the affected
bones in place. He will be in a wheelchair until
the surnrner. then he will begin physical therapy,
according to Manning.

' Manning's doctors observed that his dam-
aged skin tissue is recovering and are optimistic
that Manning would make a full recoiery over
time, according to Manning.

Though Manning's leg was never severed
nor run over by the train, news artitles {alsely re
ported otherwise. Several newspapers published
an Associated Press wire days after the event
stating that according mJody Matherly, Chiefo
Police with the Grinnell Police Department, that
Manning “deﬁnitely fell under the train in the
incident 'lhursday etening, and the trnin wheels
appear to have gone over parr of his right leg,
which was nearly severed. Such articles spurred
rurnors etaggerating Manning's injury which
quickly spread across the Grinnell Community.
Mntherly could not be reached in time for print.

Balser, who had jumped trains before the day
ofManning's accident, said he ﬂelt survivors guilt
after witnessing Manning's injury

"I also smrted to doubt my assumption that
I couldn’t also have been hurt by the train, which
is leading me to think maybe I wont lteep rid-
ing the train," Balser said. “Looking back, yeah,
it was a stupid idea, but I'm mostly gmteﬁil that
Darwin’s going to he alright."

Despite a long road of reeovery or ahead,
Manning has been focusing on the positives.

1 love doing outdoor stud I’m still going to
be able to do some outdoor stufflike ﬁshing and
even maybe trying to plny car

arming is currently facing trespassing
charges ﬁom Union Paciﬁc Railroad company,
though he has yet to go to court.The train jump-
ing footage ofManning and Balser remains with
the Grinnell Police Department and will not be
returned to the owners until the case is resolved.
Manning plans to create a ﬁlm showing the of
tennath otthe accident and his etpenenee ofber
ing in a wheeldnir.

Manning said that he is thanldirl for every-
one who helped him rtrmind campus the ﬁrst
couple of days back from hreale despite bouts o
inclement weather.

“I've learned from this experience that in life
you're always going to take risle,"Menning said.
“When I was staying with Nancy Maly she told
me to think of things like they do on Sesame
Street, that for every notion you take in life there’s
going to he consequences and to always think
