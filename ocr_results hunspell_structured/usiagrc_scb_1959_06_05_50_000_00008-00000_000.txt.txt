Hunt, Jacobson, and Jane 5
worked closely toward this com—-
mun goal and were careful to
avoid the controversy or the
traditional struggle for power
between the Student Council c
and residence hall governments t

They were hy no means s
,airaid or problems, however,
and initiated important
.changes for the Grinncll cam-
pus. The most striking change
or the year came when the
AWS Board announced that
women’s hours were to be ex»
tended to midnight ior week
day nights. A second move to.

came with the opening of all -

However, the Council under
Hunt’s Iii‘m direction was rare-
iui not to use the budge- pun“

 

inue the notable work of the
curing presidents. Some ob-
ervcrs tell that. Steve Faunce,

newly clcctcd Student Council

council members to dominate the

hat Faunce has not exerted a

The Cut"? is characterized
by an extremely conscientious
president, Dick Ramsdcll, but

one who has had little tx-
pericnce in public ofﬁce. Be-
cause of a few hasty remarks
that he has made in an official
capacity, he has brought emi-
siderablc embarrassment to the

CoilIP. Theiniamous Spring
Day committee firecracker
i'ine plunged the Student
Council and the Coflll' into a
power struggle unprecedented
in the past four years.

Such conflicts, seem quite uii-
necessary when we keep in mind
lthe fact that the purpose OI all
:Grinnell student governments is
'to serve the students and thr‘
icollege in the most efficient,
ljudicious manner possible. Re-
gardless OI the petty attitude;

oi the new student officers int
the curly weeks of their new
‘tcrins, there is every reason to
‘believe that tho oiliccrs will
.proiit from their experiences
and maintain some at the dig-
nity that the student govern»
‘mcnt bodies had achievcd unr
'der the retiring oiiieers.
