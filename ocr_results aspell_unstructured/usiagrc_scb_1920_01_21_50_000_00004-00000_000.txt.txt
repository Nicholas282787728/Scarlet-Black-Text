COLLEGE MUST KEEP
"thrown WORLD

Professor Coffnlan States Case of
Grlnnell Review In Chapel
Speech.

Emphasizing the necessity or keep-
ing in close touch with the world and
its prohlems, Protessor G. R, Colman
strongly supported the Grinnell Ree
view in chapel Monday morning.

"The college was iormerly looked
upon as a sort of a monastery, away
lironi the evils oi the world. In the
last generation and particularly since
the war, this attitude has been great-
ly changed, Whatever we do to gain
connections with the outside World is
a good thing.

“We are naturally in a receptive
frame of mind, but we should strive
to make the college a place where
ideas are not only collected and dis-
tributed, hilt in a way produced. We
liud magazines or the type of the
Grimlell Review in the east and south.
hut we are trail blazers iu the west.

Prolessor Coitmau stated that the
aim oi the Review was to reilect the
attitude oi the college toward ques
tions oi the day, and mentioned sev-
eral articles or this nature which ap—
peared iu the first two issues. He
also emphasized the desire of the
Editorial Board to encourage the stil-
dcnts to contribute.

No announcement of recent years
carires with it the importance as that
to the effect that on January 27th at
the Colonial heaer George M. Coh’du‘s
greatest masterpiece ”The Miracle
Man," which has already found its way
with marked success on the screen,
will be seen for the ﬁrst time locally
on the legitimate stage.

The cast assembled for the stage
presentation is a notable one, having
at its head the well known actor Paul
Gilmore, who in the past two seasons
has been seen in the leading roles in
"Experience" and “The Better Ole."

The central ﬁgure in the story
which is familiar to many, is a. patri-
arch in a little village in Maine, who
possesses the power to heal the sick
and maimed. "Doc" Madison, 3. New
York crook, and his pals, scheme to,
use him as a means of enriching them—
selves. With this view, they visit him
and are astounded to discover that his
power to heal is absolutely hona—ﬁdc.
How the good that lies latent in the
crooks is brought out, is the theme of
the drama, which is one of the most
striking yet produced,

Prominent in the cast at supporting
players are such well known names
as Olaf Skavian, Dixie Blair, Millie
Freeman, Bessie Dainty, Frank Reade
rick, Cameron Clemens, Hal Crane,
Helen Adair and Al Henderson.

The production is adequate in every
way and is an exact replica of the
Astor Theater production which
helped in no small way towards the
success of this most unusual play in
New York.
