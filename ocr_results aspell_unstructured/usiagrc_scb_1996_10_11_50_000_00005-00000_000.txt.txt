“From Cali Cllllowoy to Dean Mara
tin, swing has itlwitys nrcantstyle, exe
pressing on ililcitsily and naked truth
that in this tidy lmd age offers it way
ot‘copirtg with the contrived cynicism
of the ‘allcniiilive' world. The lliuStC

The band's proﬁle claili Live, the
Cherry Poppili’ Daddies e out of
. “Although the
music zllwltys inspires iunltwlty hip

swivlcrs to shake their groove things
and pitch themselves head-long into
the dark, pulsing pit, the Daddics'
songs are not vacuous ditties. Free
quently, the songs are an exploration
ot’a world goneawry.”

Reel Big Fish is the newest of the
three bands that is a part of the Com
OutSwingin’ Tour. Although ayoung
band, Reel Big Fish is rapidly gaming

www.mojoarecordscom, Reel Big
Fish has it “distinctive big band—meeLs-
tattered caffeine freak sound." '

The site explains, “As one ofSouthr
ern California's premiere ska»punk
bands, Reel Big Fish is a frightening
example of why young children
shouldn’t drink Jolt Cola. Each band
member has such a consistently high
level of energy that they could take
Ritalin offthe market, and yet Collec-
tively, they channel this energy
through ska melodies with enouglt
raw, kinetic power to turn a club up-
side down."

The Come Out Swingin' Tour will
come to Grinnell College on Saturday
night and will feature three of ska’s
most popular, up»and- coming bands,
All three of the bands have received
the praise ofcritics and fans alike, and
the concert‘promises to be a highaena
ergy, entcnaining show.

A Family Thing
By DAVID REED

Film Critic

A Family Thing, starring Rob-
ert Duvall and James Earl Jones,
opens with the death of Earl‘s
mother. On her deathbed, she
makes Earl (Duvall), a store owner
from Arkansas, promise to take
care of the family.

Earl's visions of family life ale
ter dramatically when, followtng
his father‘s death, the minister
brings Earl a letter from his
mother. In it, she informs Earl that
she is not actually his mother. His
real mother, who died while giv-
mg birth to him, was a black
woman raped by Earl's father. Earl
was born looking white and was
raised as a white man by his white
stepmother.

The letter also tells Earl that he
has a brother, Raymond (James
Earl Jones), in Chicago, and ima
plores Earl to go and see Raymond.
This film addresses how these two
brothers reconcile their past and
become family.

A great deal of the film’s suca
cess stems from the chemistry be
tween Jones and Duvall. It is ob-
vtous the two actors enjoyed their
roles. Some of the movie empha-

' sizes Earl’s acceptance‘ofhis new

racial identity. However, through

5 .

humor and its reliance on such
strong characters as Aunt T. (Irma
P. Hall), the film does not allow
this issue to become overwhelm»
ing.

Overall, I would recommend
this movie. I think that. with ac-
tors of Duvall‘s and Jones’s cali-
ber, it could have packed a little
more emotional punch, but it is an
enjoyable movie nonetheless, It
plays in the Forum on Friday at
8:30 pm. and in Harris on Satur-
day at 7:30 p.m.

ror mounts as it becomes clear that
