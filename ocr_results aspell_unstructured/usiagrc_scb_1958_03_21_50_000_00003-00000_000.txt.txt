In Advanced Courses

No specific percentage dis-
tribution is advocated, but the
maximum proportion ot .A and
13’ grades combined is tentative—
ly set at 50%, This does not
apply to any particular class,
but should guide the faculty in
grading students over a period
oi years. It is recognized that
the grade distribution will vary
among some advanced courses.
