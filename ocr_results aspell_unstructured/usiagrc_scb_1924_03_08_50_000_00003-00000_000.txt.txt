door relay carnival of the University
of Illinois ‘has passed into history, »
maintaining its supremacy as the larg-
est indoor relay meet in the the United
States. ,

Records of every description were
broken. More atheletes competed,
more schools were represented and
more spectators attended than ever
before. A world's record was broken,
one world niark tied, eight new carn—
ival records were set and the pertornr
specs in 12 of the 19 events were heta

bard of Michigan leaped 24 feet 7

inches for a new carnival record in the

broad jump. which is also probably

a world‘s indoor record on the dirt

floor. other new records were set

in the shot put, Isoolmeter run and
in all three of the college relays.

Michigan won her first relay in the
history of the carnival in the two
mile event. Notre Dame took the
university medley relay, Iowa. copped
the one-mile for the third successive,
time and Illinois now has an unbroken'
string of 12 victories in this event
that includes a \vinat the Pennsyl-
vania games in 1920.

university relay races have been run.

Tim QUESTION. '

What Do You Think of the Sunday
Dim Traditionl

The Answers.

Lester Duke: It seems to me that
Sunday is always a long day and it is
a shame that a person can not have
a date on Sunday night. From my ob»
sewatioll, {have not noticed that the
men are together more on this ray
than on any other days. They do get
together for smokers but these are
usually at ten o’clock and after dating
hours. '

Kenneth Cole: I think this tradition
should be done away with as there
seems to be no good reason for not
allowing Sunday dates. It doesn't
seem that anyone studies any more on
Sunday night and the men do not seem
to get together.

lilo-nor Long. I think that this tl'ﬂ~
dilion is unsucccsful, and that instead
of bringing it un, every few years
they shhuld allow the students to have
them and get it Over with.

Harriet Calhoun: I do approve of
this tradition. It makes every girl
sure that there is one day out of the
week when all her best friends can
be logethsl‘.’ One of the advanmges

, 0f Grinnell is that it has both co-duca-

tional and girl school characteristics.

Thompson Calhoun: I do not an-
move 0! this tradition. . Girls should
be allowed to have dates on Sunday as
well as on any other day. Sunday is
a day of relaxation, and one of the
best ways to get this is to have a. date
on Sunday night

Alice Christel-son: I think it is a
good thing because it gives freedom
to both men and Women on Sunday. It
gives a. dignity to the college on this
day that it would not if dates Were
permissible. It nnco’urliges college
spirit because it dates were allowed,
many men and women would leave the
college on this day.

Fell lint] Vim Got-den: We believe,
having made a two or three years
study of social conditions, and being
mediocre judges of pnlchritude, it
seems to us that Sunday dates should
he put up to vote of the men instead
01' the women.

Florence Graver: I believe that this

 

tradition is zt high ideal, but is one
which is very hard to attain to. It
makes Gl'inneli distinctive. 1 think
that it is a very good ideal to have
one clay set aside for the men to get
together, as Well. as the Women.

What is said to be the largest in—l
dividuai score ever made by a forward
on a girls basketball team Wits made

Wallace, running guard on the one
lanoma university basketball team,
who was seen in action here this sea-
son, has been. recently elected to cap-
tain the Sooners during the 1925 seal-t
son.

John Harshbarger, star forward at
Iowa state Teachers College has a
record for continuous playing at that
position. This year he missed only
ten minutes of play during the entire,
season, a ieat proving that he was one'
or themainsteys oi the Tutor bashed-i

was a potent factor in the oftensive
working of the Pioneer machine.

Captain Eoelter played his usual
lliishy game, getting the bail within
scoring distance on numerous oc-
casions. Everett helped in the floor
work, but was too closely guarded to
be much of a factor in the scoring.
Ghm'rett was sent to the showers for
tour personals early in the’ second
half, and Sparks, who took his place
played a much better game than Gnar—
rett, scoring two field goals.

This was Grlhne'll's final game or
the season, and they stand in seventh
place in the Missouri Valley confer—
ence, tied with Missouri with tour
games Won, and twelve lost. 1
