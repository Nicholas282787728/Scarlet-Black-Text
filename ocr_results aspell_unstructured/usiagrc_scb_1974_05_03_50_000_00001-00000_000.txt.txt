. Formal Charges

by John Wylie

Members of the Concerned Black
Students (CBS) tailed to present
”formal, substantiated charges”
against J. Richard Woodworth and
Anne E. Abler to Pres. Glenn Leg-
gett by the Wednesday midnight
deadline Leggett had set, appar—
ently ending the two-month old case.

Leggett had issued a new state-
ment Friday saying that, if subst-
antiated charges against the two
members oi the sociology faculty
were not received by the deadline,
he would declare the original char~
ges "unfounded.”

The Friday smtemﬁmt followed the
resignation of the “Wall Commit-
tee” which Leggett had appointed in
March to investigate. allegations
of racism made by CBS against Ab-
ler and Woodworth in a Feb. 27
letter to the campus.

Leggett said not, it substantiated
charges had been received‘by the
deadline, he would have initiated
the procedures leading to formal
hearings for dismissal for cause,
as required by the Trustee Ey-
LaWS which govern Grinnell Coll-

ege.
Evidence Returned
Individual black students had pre-

sented some type of substantiated

evidence to the members of the
Wall Committee, but had asked that
it be returned alter the committee
was disbanded.

Leggett said that he did notsee that

information, and. that he did not know

the identities of the individuals who
presented chargesto the Committee.

Several black students met with
Leggett Wednesday morning about
the situation. Abler and Woodworth
met with the President late Wedn—
esday, Both sides were seeking
further information about the con-
sequenoesof Leggett's decision to
accept the resignations of the Wall
Committee

No Comment

CBS Kotoko Spokesperson Pat Sw—
ansey said Thursday that she was
aware oi Leggett’s decision andthat
CBS leaders had discussed ”other
moves” in the Abler/Woodworth
case

However, she refused to discuss
the nature, timing, or locus of
any projected CBS action, and she
refused comment on why formal
charges were not presented by the
Wednesday deadline.

Speaking forWoodworth and he rs/eli
Abler said, “We’re delighted that
once again no evidence has been
presented.i.iwe know of course that
there would not be, because there
simply is no evidence for thatwhich
is not true.”

Not Enough Time

Leggett said that he did not have
time to prepare a formal statement
in connection with the latest dev-
elopments ill the Abler/Woodworth
case. He told the Scarlet and Black
that a statement would beforthcom-
ing “shortly," and said, “I have
received no formal charges from
the black students, and I Stand by
my letter of last Friday."

leashes Affect Dogs,

Q by Fred Horecky

Tanya has become a fixture in the
sunny afternoon panorama of the
Forum tied to her 250 ft. climbing
rape. AS her owner Barclay Shultz
put it, “Tanya has to stay tied up
or inside all day——she doesn’t like
either of them." T'iere is general
agreement among dog owners that
the leash law may be a “de-faeto
ban" on campus dogs in the iuture.
On Leash

Despite the fact that two student
resolutions supported the right of
students to own dogs and rejected
the need for a leash law, the 5::
voted that dogs “must be on leash
at all times.” Members of the
Pet Owners Organization have com»
plainecl that the SSA resolution
is in flagrant violation of student
sentimcit. Many stated that they
would not comply with the leash
low.

Supporters of the leash law in-
sist that the law is necessary to
control dog abuses--chasing bicy-
cles, over turning garbage cans,
eating baby trees, and disturbing
classes. According to Nine Adams,
“the leash law is the only way we
are going to have pets on campus,"
There have been fewer complaints
against dogs since the passage of
the leash law.

There have been different opinions
expressed concerning the eventual

effect of the leash law. Dog owners
ovenvhelmingly fee‘, that owning a
dog at Grinnell may no longer be
viable. Many supporters also felt
that the evenhial solution may be
a ban on dogs. Some saw a posi.
tive effect on the future oi dogs:

“If it weren’t for the leash law,
pets would definitely be outlawed
in the near future."

No one has asked Timya how she
feels about the leash law. She and
the other dogs of the Grinnell cam—
pus community have not been pre—
viously subjected to restrictiveleg.

tely believe that the law will have a

Protest'Misplaced Priorities .

After receiving a tip {ram Senamr
Joan Orr, seniors Ellen Yacknin
and Peggy Shinner organizedacam~
paign last Tuesday to protest a bill
now before the Iowa House of Rem
resentatives on the sensitive issue
of abortion

The protest centered onihe waythe
bill was being ”ramrodded"through
the House on an issue that did not
really require any legislation, since
no complaints have been received
about the present situation abortions
are run.

Permits Refusal

Basically, the proposed bill per—
mits a medical person to reiuse to
participate in an abortion against
his or her religious beliefs, unless
the operation is necessary in terms
of saving the mother’s lile, or ii

Hamilton Resigns, Accepts '
New Post of Wayne State

Associate Dean James Hamilton
is preparing to move to Detroit this
summer to assume his new posi-
tion as Associate Professor of co»
onomics at Wayne State Univer-
sity in Michigan.

In accepting the post, Hamilton
submitted his resignation as ’Ass-
ociate Dean and as Associate Pro-
fessor of economics, to be effec-
tive at the end of the term.

No Replacement Yet

No candidates have been announ-
ced to replace the administrative
position Hamilton leaves open in
Nollen House.

In addition, the economics depart-
ment does not plan to hire addit-
ional faculty to replace the vacant
spot, but will spread the current
workload of Professors Steven and
Patricia Brenner to fill the una-
voidable gaps.

Two Years

Hamilton served as the Associate
Dean of the College for two years,
after being appointed during the
summer of 1972 to fill the former
post of Waldo Walker. Walker’s

promotion followed the resignation
oi Joseph Wall as Dean of the Coll»
ege who also left the administration
to return to teaching duties.

the hospital is supported, maintained
and controlled by public authority.

The bill also allows the hospitals
to ask prospective employees whe-
ther or not they would object to
participating in an abortion.

Inappropriate

Opponents of the legislation claim
that the bill represents misplaced
priorities, since special efforts we-
re made to introduce this bill by
the House Appropriations Commi-
ttee after the deadline for new pm»
posais had passed. Ellen Yacknin
explained that by using this techni-
due, the abortion bill was automat—
ically placed on the high prioriw
list which appropriations legisla-
tion commands.

Students wrote to Rep. Grasselly,
chairman oi the Appropriations and
Ways and Means Committee,tourge
the tabling of the bill so that it
could be more thoroughly discussed
by the House and not pushedthrough
at the last minute. Some students
suggested that other legislation,
such as the bottle law, should be
sent from committee onto the House
ﬂoor for action, rather than the ab—
onion law.

Unnecessary

Others complainedthat the abortion
law is simply unnecessary sincethe
“problem" it corrects is undocu—
mented in laws. Representatives

tion, Inc., as well as Gov. Robert

Walker
Withdraws
Candidacy

It looks like Cornell College Will
not be stealing away Grinnell’s Ex«
ecutive Vice President and Dean of
Eli College, Waldo S. Walker, after

Walker sent a letter Wednesday
morning to Mount Vernon asking
that his name be withdrawn from
this lists of candidates being con-
sidered for the vacant Cornell pre~
sidencyl

Pres. Glenn Leggett was pleased
with Walker’s decision, and said,
“I’m happy that Mr. Walker has de—
cided to remain at Grinnell."
