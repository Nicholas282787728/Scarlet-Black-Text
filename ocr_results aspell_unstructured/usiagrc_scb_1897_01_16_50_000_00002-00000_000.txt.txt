high class oientertainments which
the students and town people of
Grinnell are fortunate in beingY able ,

THERE is a lamentable lack of
interest in the gymnasium work
atihe present time. Instead oi
ithc classes being large and the
gymnasium ﬁlled ctvcry evenittg,
the number taking the nvor‘t- is

cancc of this? It means that tin»
less more interest is taken anti
more Work clone. thc showing or
Grinnell in next springs contests
will be decidedly unfavorable. In

reason than that of good health.
regular eVeI'cise should be taken
every evening. and the gymna-
sium turnlshcs the proper means.
Tile approaching examinations
may have something to do with
the state of affairs, but we hope
that after they are over the numr
bel'of those taking the work will
materially increase.
