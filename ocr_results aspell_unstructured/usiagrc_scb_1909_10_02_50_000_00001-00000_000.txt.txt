a general way the nlaii tor the imme-
diate work of the Council was iormed.

The fntestion ot the apportionment
of the Semester Fcc tiind among the
ditlercnt organizations in College was
taken up and a committee appointed
to listen to any requests ior changes

over the apportionment made last

year. This committee, composed of
Professor Canard, Rachel Williams,
’10, and Ralph s. Knoules, '10. will
present the facts that come to them
during the
Thursday evening, at wliicb time the

week and report next
apportionment for the year will prob
ably be decided upon.

To provide adequately for the enter
tainment of guests or the College, both
today and in the future, the Secretary
was instructed to write to the Des
lltoines High school principal and thru
her invite the attendance or the East
Des Moines High school boys to a re
teption to be held in the Association
rooms tonight.

The fact that the trophy case slluuld
have a better location was brought out
and steps takcn to make a change. The
two facts which developed which make
it undesirable to continue the case in
its present place were, that no one can
bring visitors into the reading room
to see it without distuibing those stir
dying there, and that, in its present lo-
cation the tropbies which Grinncll had

As a standing committee who shall
see that whoever comes to Giiiinell
as guests of the College shall be made
to feel that they are the guests or the
College, Ralph Knowles, 'lo, and Der-
tlia Kleckner, '10, were appointed.

Two other important changes were
suggested during the meeting. One
was the desirability of having some
sort of a supervising committee which
shall make it a practice to keep the
accounts of all

on a businesslike basis.

The other
need was the regulation of the amount
of time a student should devote to
what are commonly known as outside
interests.
