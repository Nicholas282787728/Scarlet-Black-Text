Chris Marcy,

The pickets hoped to dram- !

atize the tact that disarma-
ment is a. desperately import-
, ant issue, which has not yet
been settled, which can still
be inﬂuenced by public opin-
ion if people are concerned
enough to act decisively.

One part of the incident
which should not go unnoticed
is the ad hominem nature of
behavior of a few observers.
Instead oi replying to the issue
which the pickets posed. these
observers §truck at the person-
al qualities of the demonstra—
tors.

They called them commics.

eggheads, drnlt dodgers, dis.

for refutation; and if education
does nothing else for us. it
should at least make this simple
principle of logic and human
association clear.

demonstrators had a periect
