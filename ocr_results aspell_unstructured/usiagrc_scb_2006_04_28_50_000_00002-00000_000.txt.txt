0 Tomorrow George Churinoil, a Buddhist monk, will
present two talks. The first will be a lecture at noon in ARH
305 followed by a hosted discussion at 3 pm. in the Forum
South Lounge. The talk will focus on karma and is sponsored
by the Dhurma Discussion Group and the Chaplin's Ofﬁce. a
George Dtilkc ’so, president emeritus and a former professor
of history, delivered this week’s convocation lecture. “Phi Beta
Kappa, Griunell and the Liberal Arts" explored the mysteries
ofPhi Beta Kappa membership and its nearly iooeyear history.
“As a Phi Beta Kappa member, I waut[ed] to discuss the im-
portance of the national organization and what it means to aca—
deiuia,”Dr.\ke said in a college press release 9 Grinnell moved
up in the RecycleManiu competition this year, after finishing
31 out of 34 schools last year. This year, Grinneli ﬁnished 17
of 45 schools. The college beat out such institutions as Hare
vard University and Brigham Young University. “This year, we
included all of the campus instead of just the dorms, and we
ended up with 23.93 pounds [of recycling] per person includ
ing students, faculty, and staff,” said Environmental Coordinar
tor Jennifer Jordan. ‘ ——rmpr‘ledly Lair Garcia

believes in that sanctity oflife,l can tilt at windmills or make
a difference," Blouin said. Blouin calls for reducing abortions
by “giving women more choices," such as expanded access to
health care for children and ease ofadoption.

All three see Iowa’s education system as a problem with
some urgency. Iowa‘s teacher pay ranks 41st in the nation and
has been dropping in recent years. While in the legislature Fal—
lon introduced a bill to fully fund all areas of education by ten
pealing “tax breaks for special interests," according to his web-
site. The bill failed, but Fallon still supports the proposal,

Blouin calls for freezing tuition at public universities for
{our years, and using money from the state’s budget surplus to
meet part of the university system’s rising costs.

Culver has proposed guaranteeing every graduating Iowa
high school student one year of tuition at a public university,
while stepping up programs to make sure that high school stu-
dents graduate with more college credit.

Trustees on campus hear
perspectives on wind energy,
investing, Alternative Break

Trustees began arriving Thursday for what is likely to be the
least confrontational spring meeting in years.

This year no tuition protests outside the Old Glove Factory
are planned, but instead ofseties of presentations and exchange
cs ofinformation between students and board members.

“We really wanted to formalize and add some coheswn to
[student interaction with titistces]," said SGA President john
Bohmnn Y06.

Last night trustees gathered to hear a series ofsiudent pres
sentations on topics that students selected as being most impor
tant. This was a change from previous years when SGA hosted
a Trustee open forum, or more recently, when select trustees
made presentations to the students roliowed by question and
answer periods.

“We really thought this would complete the dialogue,” said
Bohman, who planned the change with Vice President Chris
Ochoa '06. The two reviewed seven applications for- presentrte
tions and selected three for the trustees to hear.

Linn Davis ’08 and Latona Giwa ‘09 presented on social-
ly responsible investing, an issue that the trustees will decide
whether or not to make a committee on this weekend. Willa
Campbell'07 presented on the projected $15,000 budget short—
fall for Alternative Break funding in hopes of maintaining the
program with the loss oftargcrcd fund raising.

Finally, Eli Zigas loo and Emily stiever '09 presented on
constructing a wind turbine on campus.

Environmental issues are a major issue this meeting, and the
trustees will also be hearing a presentation from NanJenkSrJay,
the environmental coordinator at Middlebury College, which
has actively pursued a green campus. There will be a formal
presentation from the Building and Grounds committee about
the possibilities for turbine construction.

Bohman said that his interaction with the trustees would _
focus on alumni development rather than tuition this year.
“[Alumni giving] is someting we can affect right now,"he said.
“Ifwe had a stonger alumni development we could talk about
tuition."

The Student Affairs Trustee Committee will also vote on
gendetsneutral housing and hear the Student Wellness Ree
View.

Ask The President

 

 

 

Where did you go for your undergraduate
degree and what did you study? How do
you think your experience differed than
if you had gone to Grinnell? DO you ever

wish you had gone to Grinnell?

I attended Yale College and majored in history, focus-
ing on English history My classes were bigger than here
(sometimes several hundred people) but the curriculum was
t liberal arts curriculum and I am grateful for that lifelong
education in the signiﬁcant areas of human knowledge. I am
not the kind of person who tries to go back and think about
how I would change things ifI could, but I will say I loved
my undergraduate education as 1 hope everyone at Grinnell
will love theirs (in retrospect.) If I had to express a regret,
it would be that I did not take enough science as an under»
graduate.
