Students talk bias-motived incident in all campus forum

Direct and indirect victims share how their lives have changed, advocate a positive change

By MAX CALENBERG

on Thursday, May 13, students, faculty
and staff gathered inJoe Rosenf‘leld ’25 Center
101 for an all campus forum to discuss their
thoughts on the recent bias-motivated incir
dent (see soda 5/7).

President Russell K. Osgood began discus
sion by emphasizing the importance of hear-
ing what others had to say.

“I welcome this opportunity to listen and
hear what you are say—
ing, I will say, I've been
listening for while and
really enjoying what
I’m hearing. I don’t en-
joy having to be here
because of the incident
that led to this.” Os-
good said. “But, I have
enjoyed listening to
varied comments, very
thoughtful comments
for the week.”

With that, a safe
space was established
and women who felt comfortable enough to
identify themselves as having their names
written on a bowl at the party stood up. Three
of these women read personal statements

“I‘m goofy, ridiculous and thoughtful. how-
ever the other night none of that mattered,"
said Emma Peterson '10, who was targeted in
the incident. “One of the hardest parts of this
whole ordeal for me has been ll loss of tins!
and sense of safety in tlic community Not ii
loss oi’sifety in a physical sense, but in that l
chose to come to Clinnell so i could be myself
and not ivoiri about how people would judge

tome to campus.”

me.
After the women’s statements, there were
“fishbowl dialogues" where a group of indi-
viduals sat in circle of chairs and discussed how
their lives at Grinnell changed since learning
about the proceedings of the “Cunnilingus"
party. The first group was made up of student
athletes who identify as any gender. They ex—
pressed feelings ranging from betrayed to
hopeful for change in the future.

“Before this happened.
I thought I could think of
all athletes as friends,” said
one strident.

Also part of the ath»
letes‘ discussion were
members who attended
the party, who talked about
feeling guilty and how this
event has changed their
understanding _ of how
their actions can be per
ceived by others.

The next assemblage of
speakers was all individu-
als who identified as womenThey commented
on confusion and the effects ofthc incident on
their daily lives for the past week and half.

Following the women was an assortment of
men, somc ofwhom apologized for their inacr
rion during the event. One professor remarketr
ed that the difference between this and other
sea ally themed panics was that the participa-
rion in all the other parties was voluntary in
coutiiist to Cunnilingus, which created an inn

Coach Jeff Pedersen Y02 spoke during this
grouping. He promised moving forward from
this event byway ofnew programming for stus
dent athletes during the fall.

Professor Samuel Rebelsky, computer sci—
ence, who spoke at the forum, believes Peder»
sen is committed to these changes.

“I think Jeff Pedersen is very serious,”
Rebelsky said. “He is going to change what
is happening when students come to cams

us.’
P After the forum, AJust member Robin
Wetherill‘lZ reﬂected on the proceedings.

“It was gratifying to hear the male ath-
letes actually express remorse and ownership
of their actions because I feel like I've heard
less ofthat,”Wetherii.l said.

Wctherill was also incredibly proud of vice
tims who spoke out.

“I was pretty inspired by the courage of
people who were directly targeted to speak
about their experiences," VVehter'ill said. “In a
forum like that, somebody hands you a micro
phone, and they give you the power to speak
in way that isn't always easy in everyday life,
especially if what you're speaking about is that
emotionally difficult for you to deal with just
on its own,”

One of the targeted women who spoke
echoed this call for change, but added ii Condl’
non,

“Everybody just needs to accept the fact
that the objective behind [Cunnilingus] is
bad.” she raid. “If everybody can accept that
fact, than we aim move forward and make a
positive change in our community and we can
more foiwiid and make a vcry very positive
change in our sot-ion and world at large,"

Beekeeping club
finalizes plans

By CAROLIN SclloLz

Bees are polarizing creature57whilc loved
by some, others are deathly afraid to go near a
single one. And they're coming to Grinnell.

A student initiative passed at the begin
ning of this semester proposing studentrrun
beehives on campus. Four beehives are already
in Grinnellijust not on campus, The club’s
founders, Ian McCallumsCook ’12 and Grif-
fin Sinith’12,still have to overcome some final
legal hurdles to get the bees in a more perina-
nent location.

“We have four bee hives installed about
four miles away from campus." McCalluinr
Cook said.

The hives are currently on the grounds of
Biology Technical Assistant Sue Kolbe, ac-
cording to Smith and McCallum-Cook. Be
fore being able to bring the bees onto campus,
the club must attain an official permit to keep
bees within city limits as well as clearing up
some insurance issues with the college's ad-
ministration.

“The College wants to cover itself lee
gally," smith said. "Our understanding is
that they won’t face the same problems
if the bees are not directly on campus."

However, insurance is not the only
problem that has made it difficult
to get the bees on campus thus far.

“[Facilaties Management] would not give
us permission to place the bee hives on top
of Noyce,” smith said, adding that for pol-
lination across campus it would have been a
prime location, The group was also not able
to obtain permission to place the bee hives
in the community garden or at EcOrHouse.

"We have two other possible locations right
now," Smith said. “Either east of the track or
two blocks west from campus at Professor [of
Education] Jean Ketter’s house."

The idea of having a beekeeping club at
GrinnellcamefrombothMcCallumsCookand
Smith. Smith has been keeping bees for over
nine years while McCallumsCook worked as
a semi—commercial beekeeper in Pennsylvania.

“While talking about beekeeping we no-
ticed that a large amount of people seemed
interested in it," McCallum-Cook said,

One of the objectives of the group is to
keep this interest going for the next four years.

“Our intention is that the club outlasts us,”
McCallumsCook said.

In addition to the duo ofstudents fostering
the club, the group is supported by Professor
Elizabeth qieathem. biology, and Professor
Jru than Andelson ‘70, anthropology, who
serve as mentors.

“\Ne want the faculty to be involved," Mc-
Cliuiiln’COOk said.
