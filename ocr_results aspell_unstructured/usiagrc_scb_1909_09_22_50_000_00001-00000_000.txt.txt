Yesterday morning, after a night
spent in sleuthing about the neigh-
boring towns, the members of the
freshmen and Sophomore classes met
in a brief and brisk clash on the
campus, ending iii a complete viitory
for the new arrivals, who had the SM:
istaction of seeing their opponents sc-
ciit-ely tt-iissed up and helpless alter

Fol'tyllll‘ee men appeared at Alumni
Hall last night in response to Pre '
dent Wilson’s call for candidates for
the vacancies in the Grinnell College
Glee Club.

As has been the custom
past, the examination was conducted
before the members 0( the Clilb, by

Professor Pierce.

While no phenomenal voices were
heard, still satisfactory material was
discovered for the l)tISS illltl second
Lcllor llilrts.

Only one new man of first tenor Clll'
iber tried out, so it is evident that
the three vacancies in this part will
be by far the most difficult to fill.

From last night's preliminary, the
Club selected the following number of
candidates to for the second
tr rout: Four first tenor, six second
tenor, fire baritone and six bass. Al-
together there are twelve places to be
filled, The second preliminary will be
held at Alumni Hall, Thursday eve
