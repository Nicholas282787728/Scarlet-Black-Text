pea rig in Grinnell this Saturday. The Boys oi the Lough have

achieved interilati

i tame ior their virtuosity and spontaneity in

musical expression. The Irish Times says of their music, “to
congregate four musicians and have them mix the musical traditions
of Scotland lreland. Shetland. and Norlhuinbi'ia could in theory prove

a inusi

I disaster. In practice the formula has produced LI brand of

music that is lull of guts and technical brilliance. Rolling Stone

Magazine said in a recent revie

“a qu tet at young B 'tisli in-

April snowstorms or no, the iirst
true sign of spring arrived this
Aveek with the opening day at the
baseball season. No other single
day of the year can match opening
day in terms or the excitement and
promise that moment holds tor all
tans. On the tirst day oi the season,
every team is a potential pennant
contender, every player a possible
MVP. In honor of this very special
day. two oi.the better examples of
baseball cinema will be shown on
campus,

iiang the Drum Slowly (1973,
96 min.) was adapted from the 1956
Mark Harris novel about the
friendship between a reserve
Catcher and a star pitcher. Robert
DeNiro is Bruce Pearson, the slow,
Socially awkward backstop, and
Michael Moriarty is Henry
Wiggen, the photogenic,
Seaveresque hurler. What makes
their relationship special is that
Wiggen is the only man on the team
who knows that Pearson is slowly
dying. Wiggen’s attempts to hide
the fact trom me players and
coaches during a run at the pen-
nant and Pearson’s gradual
realization of his fate are well
conveyed as DeNiro and Moriarty
turn in their customary first-rate
performances, Director John
Hancock does a decent,yob oi
crating a realistic baseball at-
mosphere (although aﬁcianadas
will notice some flaws), and the
acting is Solid throughout. Vincent
Gardenia is especially good as the
team’s manager, More im-
portantly, -“Bang the Drum
Slowly" avoids most of the sen
timentality inherent in its plot.

' Dance '1“ '
troupe
tryouts

The Grinnell Dance Troupe will
be losing ten at its members at the
end 01 this semester to ol'frcampus
programs and graduation.

since many people have ex-
pressed an interest in trying out lot
the group, it has been decided to
break with precedent and hold
tryouts ior new members this
semester, Workshops will be held
Tuesday through Friday, April 12-
1.5, at 4:15 in the Dance Studio, Fine
Arts Building.

Babe Voei'tman, director of the
troupe, said that the purpose of the
workshops is to acquaint
prospectives with the space, the
people and the kind of work that is
done so that they will Show to their
best advantage when under con-
sideration At the end of the four
sessions those who wish to become
permanent members oi the troupe
will be notified if they have been
accepted. Attendance at all four
classes is desirable but not man-
datory

“We, of Course, are looking for
the best dancers we can find, but
experience and proiiciency are not
the only criteria we go by,”
Voertman continued “Energy,
dedication and imagination are
considered equally important to
quality of the work in class as well
as performance."

Tryouts will be held again next
fall at the usual time to give one
_ tering freshmen and, ,others '

another chance to oin‘ the troupe. '

by Peter Jaroit

One oi the game's all-time
greats is the subject of the second
baseball film, Pride of the Yankees
(1942, 128 min), ND, "0,
it's not Fred Stanley, Gary Cooper
portrays the “Iron Man," Lou
Gehrig, who Still holds (and
probably always will)‘ the major
league record of playing in 2,130
consecutive games.

“Pride of the Yankees" traces
Gehrig's lire irom his youth on the
streets of New York to the sad and
sudden end of his brilliant fifteen
year career in 1939. Joining Cooper
(who gives perhaps his best
character study) are Walter
Brennan, Dan Duryea, and three
members oi Yankee championship
teams: Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel,

"

and Mark Koenig (you could look it
up), Herman Mankiewicz (of
“Citizen Kane” fame) received an
Academy Award nomination for
his work on the screenplay.

The Sexuality Resource Group
wanted a film that would provoke
discussion, and they couldn’t h "
picked a better one for that pur’
pose than “Carnal Kowledge”
(1971, 96 min), Mike Nichols’s ﬁlm
traces the sexual behavior of t
men from their college days in 3%
1940’s to their rather depressing
middle ages in the 1970’s Jack
Nicholson and Art Garfunkel are
the men, and Anneivtargarct and
Candice Bergen the key women in
their lives. “Carnal Knowledge” is
a little shallow, but well made and
well acted.
