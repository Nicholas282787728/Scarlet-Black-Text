'Grlnuell Affirmative criticizes
Armed Intervention Policy
of United States.

Debating before an audience that
completely filled the Clnrk liall club~

Griuuell college lreshman allirniative
team won a two to one audience ties
cision over a much older and expe-
ienced negative team lrom Drake nn

that the United states should cease

Cause of Unrest.

The affirmative contended that the
United States' policy of armed
ventlon in Latin-America today is the
cause of much political unrest and
ill will toward our sci-called imperial—
istic policy. Tyler and Spencer point
ed out that the policy of intervention
is undesirable from a standpoint of
international good will. that that it is
unnecessary because the government
is“ not obligated to care for foreign ins
terests of‘ big business They fur-
ther pointed out that big business ls
not deserving of government aid since
it was cognizant of its risk when the
investments were made

Hawk concluded the
case by saying that international
enmity could he the Duh still of our
imperialism. His talk ws character-
ized by eflccl' e humor and satire, as
was Spencer’s.

Alden Greene Tells
Of Life at American
University at Cairo

The tolloi ng letter was received
by Davis Greene from his brother,
Alden Greene, ‘27, who is teachi at
the American University at tta o,
Egypt:

Sunday, Member 8, 1
Dear Folks,

The news of the last couple weeks
i vt much. Last Saturday all or the
Bachelors went out a tea at the home
ol one at the studcuts in Form ii.
It was the first time that I had boon
to one and 1 expected that it would
be intei _ ing. It was. it should
have been announced for a banquet.
The whole table, big enough for eight
people, was covered by plates coutai
his two cakes, tour plates of two di
fercnt kinds of bread. two plates of
cookies and three or tour of French
pastry. Along with the bread wc
were offered the smoothest rose teal
preserves imaginable. Alter milling-
ing to get rid at all of two cups of
tea. the table wlls cleared. and some
oranges and real American apples
were brought on, Apples here are
quite expensive and the usual kind
conic [ram Syria Those, however,
were great big ones that are imported
from the States, and are friglittully
high. Attcr finishing off all the fruit
we could hold, we adjourned to the
parlor and took some lessons in the
game of triclctrack, the international
game at this part ol the world. It is
bleyed on a back-gammon board with
checkers. the movements licing gov-
criied by dice. It offers the same ops
coin; in society that hridee offers at
home, and we had lots or run twins
to learn all its i tricaoics,

The second big cvcnt of die week
was a big party that some til us went
to down at Groppi s. Some tourist
friends or Pliillip's came through, and
the old gentleman of the party ole
lcrcd to set its tip to the party. Need-
:le - to say we accepted with almost
iinipropci speed. Ten of us. including
some ol the Girls (‘ Girls. wont down

the whole crowd. I might say that
Groppi's is a really decent [lltlcr to

the diflcrent kinds of people that
come in. You can frequently rind too
different nationalilics sitting within a

them, Sometimes the language is r'lifr
lercnt, or they are eating particular
things, or have on some particular
costume.

Yesterday, due to the lact that we
had to shut down the school tor the
Eastern Christmas, we had another
vacation. From now on through the

Finally we arrived at the end or the

the station we came to the site of the
ancient capitol of Memphis. The his
tory of the place runs back to pi-
historic times. imagine a city being
the capitol or any country for over
4,000 years: You would think that
there would be a great many ruins

never used the expensive stone for
anything that they would use in this

that would be their homes for all
eternity. However. there are‘some
huge mounds ol reluse in which are

We illso found some little pieces of
some alabaster rods which the same
man said were used as a stylus in
writing, It was so interesting that we
spent all the morning there, and
didn't notice that it was clouding up
until it began to rain. It didn't raiii
much, and the ride back was almost
as good as ‘he ride out except for the
fact that we had no breakfast or

like that oftener.

large pond in which were swimming
probably 1500 different kinds of wa-
ter birds. In the middle were little
islands DD which were growing trees
