Missy Sharer‘s 27 points, but the
team walked away with little else to
brag about.

Fortunately, the combination of
practice and Thanksgiving break
helped the Pioneers bounce back
against Upper Iowa on Tuesday
night. The team showed theeontin»
uedcommitmentorthep1ayers,and
duetothiseommiunent,the women
came out on top, 33,73

Coach Eskildsen said that both
the offense and defense executed
the game plan well, and the team
posted its “best performance of the
season.“ "the scoring came from

where it was needed under the new
offense. with Sharer scoring 30
points and Jenny Wood hitting 20.

Also commended were Amy
Fort for playing the “best game of
her career" totalling seven assists
and only ihree turnovers, and Kiers
i-ieruy, who provided the “inside
contingent spark" with 14 boards.

Coach Eskildscn was pleased
with the play on Tuesday because
he felt that adjustments were made
that needed to be made.

The women continue play today

Monday against Carleton. Both
games are in Darby gymnasium,
with lip-off at 7 pm.
