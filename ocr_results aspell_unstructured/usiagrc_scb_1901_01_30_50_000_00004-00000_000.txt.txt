Grinnell Defeats Y. M. C. A. by 3
Score of 13 to lo.

To the friends of basket ball at
Iowa College the game last Sate
urday was gratitying in every way.
The Des Monies Y. M. C. A was
believed to have a strong team
and Summits standing could in a
very great measure be determined
by the outcome of the game with
them. That the result was victory
and by the score of i3 to 10 was
verysatistactoi-y. Tlieothcrpleas
ing features were the attendance
and enthusiasm. A larger crowd
than the seating taeiiities were
able to accommodate was present,
and the ﬁerccness of the playing
called forth an exhibition of cola
legespirit which could not well he
criticised.

Tile two teams appeared on the
gymnasium itoorat about3 o'clock
and the Des Moines aggregation
went through some preliminary
passes and trials for baskets which
brought forth groans from the
Grinnell sympathizers. From the
very tossrtip the game was played
almost with desperation by both
sides. Glinnell had the best of it
in keeping the ball near the oppo-
nent's goal but was discouragingly
weak in throwing at the basket,
Trial after trial was made but the
ball never got nearer than the
outer edge of the basket, from
which it bounded in a most exas-
peraiing manner. Des Moines
did not get far into Grinnell terri-
tory very otten but when she did
get there she made the best of her
opportunities and the First halt
ended with the score 4-4.

The second half showed no let
up in aggressiveness. Filmore
took Wilcox's place at ceiitel.
Des Moines played the same line-
up as in the ﬁrst half. The play-
ing was rougher in this halt and
touling was more irequent. hotli
sidesdoingtheirshare. Thestrng-

 

gle was a most exciting one. ﬁrst
one team being in the lead and
than the other. Ha’l'ris succeeded
in landing the only basket thrown
{tom the foul line. though bollt‘
sides had liequent trials. Ncltlitrl
,side was assured tit victory until
time was called. Douglas played
the most consistent game for
Grinlicll. His playing was always
fast and he was the surest man at
throwing a basket from ﬁeld. Dlg'
nan took a brace in the latter part
ot the game and pushed Douglas
hard for honors. ‘
Grinllell excelled in team work
but had not a single player who
was capable ot throning a basket.
