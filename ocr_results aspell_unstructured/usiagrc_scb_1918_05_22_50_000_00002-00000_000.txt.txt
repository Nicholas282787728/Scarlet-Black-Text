THE RED CROSS DRIVE
once more Griuncll has been called
upon to contribute its share to a great
cause. Once more the college which
succeeded in pushing its \\‘al' savings
Stamp campaign tar béyolld the hopes
it its most ardent supporters, has been
asked to iespond generous , to a cause
cqiially- as deserv g, equally as neces—
sary. the campaign of the American

Red Cross.

Battles do not come singly. Each
battle is a part or a great campaign
which is destined to end in victory. it
is so with the soldiers at the from. it
is so herewith us in Grinneii. The
Liberty Loan, tbc Vlar Sayings Stamp
campaign, and the Red Cross drive
are all battles vital in themselves, but
absolutely without victory it not link—
ed together.

The work of the Red Cross is eoiiale
lv as important as that of any other
branch or the army. Its purposes are
to keep up the inoralc, to care tor the
wounded on the field or battle and in
the hospital, to look after sanitary
condltions,——these antl many more.
Cannot we, even it impelled by no oth-
er motive than the thought oi our own
soldiers in France, dig a little deeper
into our pocketbooks and contribute
something to an organization roi-
which every Crinnell man may some
day have need" And let's see not how
little we can contribute without hnrte
iiig our consciences, biil, rather, how
much he can givc without \lnl‘eﬂsour

What docs one gain at college? ThC

icge con 0, Aside from the pron:
siohai training received, one benefit

looms large—the acquisition oi sett-

'riiiality, so that we may meet the vary

largely voluntary. many students rail
to give any contribution to the
thought, because they do not have
sntricient conﬁdence ,in their lillml'lr

honest study ot the subject, liowcvei,
a student should be willing to express

an cttort. The student has then at
tained some degree of sen-assurance,

In the social lire otiered by a col-
lege a student meets people or every
type. With the conﬁdence born or this
experience he becomes a judge of line

‘ judgments on character.

In Short, tile college aims to train
a man to have conﬁdence in himself,
and to fail to acquire self—assurance
is to tail to receive one or the lasting
beneﬁts or college education.
