IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 2i, 1903.

 

ROOTERS ARE ORGANIZED.

Enthusiastic Mass Meeting or Men is
Held Monday Aftctnoonijnmes
to be King Rooteriorgante
action is to Live And
Flourish.

In recognition of the fact that
rooting has hitherto been
ducted at Iowa College on too
loose a scale. the men of tile instir
tution betook themselves to
tlte gymnasium Monday afternoon
and took some measures which
will serve from now onto correct
this fault.

A hundred and'twentyrﬁve men
were present and the 'errthusiasrn
and interest showed by all who
were there bespeaks a large result
from the work of the hour. It
was unanimously decided to
organize Iowa College students ine
to a permanent band for rooting
at athletic contests. A temporary
constitution was adopted and of-
ﬁcials consisting of a King Rooter
and four squad leaders u-erechosen
from the assembly under the conr
stituliori as adopted. TotheKrng
Rooter falls the lot of leading all
the yells at conlcsts. and the
general direction of his subordir
nates as well as that of presiding
at the regular meetings of the
organization.

The position of chief glory fell
to Henry James ’04; Roscoe
Browu,ArchieWildcr, Paul Trigg
and \V. Hunting being chosen as
squad leaders. The Kingand his
squad leaders were also elected by
the body as a committeeto attend
tothe matter of yells and insignia,
and to provide a permanent con-
stitution. About a hundred mem
bers were enrolled at Monday’s
meeting and a hundred more are
expected to join the ranks within
a day or so.

The second session of the order
will be held \Vednesday afternoon
at 4:t5 when a few yells
will be practiced along with lhe
old ones in preparation for the
grand joint mass meeting of Fri-
day in which all students, both
men and women ol'theinstitution,
will parlicipate, The order cxr
pects to do its ﬁrst work at the

con-

new

Iowa game.

We wish to call attention otlhc
Daily Iowan to the fact that in
the Grinncll —— Minnesota game,
halves of twerrtv ﬁve and twenty
minutes were played instead of
twenty and ten as stated in Tues-
day 'ssue. No doubt lhclowan
obtained this information from
the same source that supplied it
with its ante belluin pipe dream
for the week ending with Iowa's
ﬁasco at Minneapolis

on Northrup Field is by common
consent one ot the most poweriul

ing the last two weeks has been
something tremendous. The rigid

was powerless against them even

ERICKSON ls HOFEFUL.

Coach Conﬁdent that our Men Will Give
Good Account or Themselves.

“I have nothing but praise tor
the work oi the team during the
past week. The players have a
spirit and adash that is satisfac-
tory in every respect. The way
they resisted the heavy men from
Missouri, oirt witted, out maneu-
vered and out played them was a
credit to the college. Grinnell
has a team to be proud or. Every
man is in good physical condition
and will be in shape Saturday to
play the best football he knows
how to play. We may trust the
team to givea good account of
itself in the Iowa game. At Columv
biatltey did not do anything but
saw wood and make scores. even-
when tantalized bythe worst pro-
vocation a football man can have
to put up with.”

These are the words of coach

SCARLET AND BLACK man last night

mage is the last hard practice of
