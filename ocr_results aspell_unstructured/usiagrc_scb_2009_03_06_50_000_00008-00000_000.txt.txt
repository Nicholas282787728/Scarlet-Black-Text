A debate about Milk and drunk dial from President Richard Nixon

Milk
(2008)

Discussing the merits of Milk

Mark: Straighrsup movie reviews get bor—
ing after a while. Movie reviews as debates,
however, are usually a little more interesting.
Since seeing Milk,l have felt like one of the few
viewers to leave the theater with mixed feelings.
But instead of taking the whiny contr-arian
route,jaysen Wright '09 and Iwill instead argue
why Milt works and why it doesn’t. We will
probably leave more sure of our opinions than
when we started.

Jaysene Mil/es Oscar wins last week (Best
Actor, sean Penn; Best original screenplay,
Dustin Lance Black) were well deserved—it's
a story whose historical relevance is pertectiy
timed, presenting a phenomenal group otactors
with material that pulls us fully and completely
into the 19705 world ofSan Francisco.

Mark: The movie moves through the ups
and downs of Harvey Milk's political career.
It begins with Milk's local activism within the
Castro District and spends time following
Milk's campaigns to serve on the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors (the city council) and
the campaign against Proposition 6, designed
to keep gay teachers out of California schools.
Woven in throughout the movie is real life
footage of statewide and national campaigns
designed to depict the gay rights movement as
it stood across America in the ‘70s.

Jaysen: Sean Penn anchors the ﬁlm as
Harvey Milk Penn’s a chameleon, adopting the
voice, accent, and the physical tics of Harvey
Milk, but more importantly, capturing his true
essence: a man who came out of the closet late
in life, but ms ultimately determined to make a
difference in his new community.

Mark: Which basically means that Har-
vey Milk is every screenwriters dream for a
feelsgood plodine, we have our fearless leader
ﬁghting against injustice, refusing to let out: po-
litical defeat after another stop him, confront-
‘ing misguided politicians, eventually winning
his election and finally dying with dramatic
mrrsrc from Tosca. lt’s biopic 101.

Jaysen; False! Harvey Milk isn't glorified
in this movie; Dustin Lance Black’s screenplay
and Sean Penn‘s performance make sure ofthat,
We see Milk as a good and flawed human being,
one whose political lust is at times unbecoming
and alienating to the people who love him, but
whose heart is generally in the rrglrt place,

Milkwas a politician, not a saint The scene
where Milk's lovcr- Scott Smith (James Franco)
says that he can’t take any more of the polrrie
cal world that they have become a part of rang
true—not overdone, but honest and from the
heart. The scene in which Milk “waxes" (read:
forces) one orhis campaigner-s out ofrhc closet
is uncomfortable because it shows Milk’s crucler
and less compassionate side—he's the boss, the
people working for him will follow his rules,

Mark: I can't deny the power of these
scenes, 1 just have a problem with how they're
set up, The tensions bctwcen Milk and Smith
often get pushed aside for more detached scenes
describing their relationship The same thing
happens with his second partner, Jack Lira (Die
ego Luna). When the relationships fall apart.
rve haven't had the buildup to give it a real dras
rnatic punch or effectively convey the downside
oiMilk's political obsession.

I feel like it’s a decision from director Gus
Van scar and Dustin Lance Black to keep
Milk's world consistently moving forward in»
stead of stepping back and developing what's
there, making Mill look more like a movie
with an agenda than a tale of an iconic poli-
tician. Even Milk's scene forcing a supporter
out ofthe closet seems like a one-off. The film
moves quickly into the Prop 6 campaign about
gay teachers in California and does not use the
scene to discuss the gay rights movement as a
whole, Am I expecting too much nuance from
a relatively straightforward movie?

Jayson: In a word: yes, i see your very valid
point about the relationship that we see bee
twecn Milk and Lira, but we have to remember
that Van Sam is deliberately focusing on links
public life while letting his private life slip into
the background because that’s exactly what
Milk was doing, He was a politician who was,
at times, so bent on what he could achieve that
his personal relationships suffered.

Further.whrle the movie may be “sn aightfor-
wrlr'd,"l think that's one of the film’s strengths.
It allows us to appreciate how strikingly relevant
the issues that the ﬁlm grapples with are to us
as a modern audience, A community organizer
who uses hope to invigorate his campaign? A
proposition that will deny gay people rights?
1 think the parallels are obvious enough. The
film is more than just issues though. It’s an
honest look . a good maneea man we can all
learn from. I atway the straightforward ap-
proach wo eiywcll.

Mark- Ok. so maybe lover analyzed the film,
But if rt the straightforward nature ofthe
film, I'm stilt celing underwhelnretl when the
credits roll. It’s just too simple Of course I‘m
going to be on banks side; he’s got the political
parallels and evil bigoted rightavrngers to fight.
Gus Van Sant would drag me out of the theater

ifl felt any other way.

This isn't a bad film, but a decent one int
vigorated with great performances that falls a
litde short. Most people will undoubtedly come
out happy But with a byethesnumbers plot, it
needs and deserves something more to push it
into greatness, and it's just not there.

Frost/Nixon
(2 008)

Politicaldjousting, Watergate
guilt an cheeseburgers

Frets/Nivoa doesn't seem on paper like it
would have big screen potential; it's adapted
from a Broadway play which chronicles the
1977 interviews between British journalist Dir
vid Frost (Michael Sheen) and the disgraced
former President Richard Nixon (Frank Lane
gella) that included Nivon's first tacit admission
of guilt for the Watergate scandal,

This isn't exactly the most enthralling prenrs
is: for anyone besides political nerds, but ill Ce
rot Ron Howard (11/10/10 1.], Tommy Grow/i
S/JMU) does a fine job bringing out the most
d rratic and interesting aspects of the talks.

i's Chief of Staff lack Brennan (Kevin
Bat i) compares the tension in the series of
interviews to that of a boxing match. Frost is
the upsandscomer, famous in Britain and frrrally
getting his shot at American fame by scoring a
prirnetimc bout with the Champ.

Thankfully, though, Howard do sn‘t actually
set rip the movie in this manner, Boring matches

generally involve tedious amounts of boredom
mixed with quick ﬂutries ofentertaining action,
The Frost/Nixon interviews get portrayed in a
way that better resembles the documentary ofa
boxing match. With this format, the audience
gets to see all the haymakers and combinations
that actually land, interspersed with the ongoe
ing stnrggles and anxieties ofboth the Frost and
Nixon sides had throughout.

But the movie couldn't survive without solid
characters. lVIostly, the movie couldn't survive
without a drop-dead awesome Richard Nixon.
Even if the actor playing him does a good job,
you go into the movie expecting a mix ofhistor-e
ic images ofNixon with those orLaugello, and
you expcct it to be at least slightly offsputting.
However, once Langella's Nixon first appears on
screen, you instantly see how he embodies the
president. In fact, Langella quickly makes you
forget that he's impersonating Tricky Dick.

But amidst all thc political jousting, the best
part of the movie has nothing to do with polie
tics. We've all been there. It's ldtc at night, all
of your friends are out or gone, and all you to
ally want is a cheeseburger. Suddenly the phone
rings. It's one ofyour drunk friendsThcy kind
of ramble on for awhile and maybe let a thing or
two 5er that they shouldn't have, but it's just a
standard drunk dial, a conrmon occurrence

Now imagrne that the “friend" that called
you up was Richard Niron. derd Frost gets
that phone call, where Nixon confesses many of
his Watergate sins and cornmiscr-ates with l-‘rost
for being “outsiders." Although the plot point
is a fabrication by sci-eerrwi-iter/playwright Peter
Morgan, the scene and its aftermath are absoe
lutcly rivcting, humani rg N'won, brieﬂy for-e
getting the tension that has built up, and shows
ing us something a little more real than political
theater,
