Peters Raps With Students”

by Don Dagenais

In a well-attended, and at
times rather uproarious,
CHP‘AWS meeting last Mon-
day night Grinnell Police Che
ief Peters fielded questions,
lectured on regulations, and
generally shot the hull with a
South Lounge full of light
hearted students.

In the lessethan-scrious se~
sseion the major point of dis
cussion was, of course, the
campus drug situation and
what the police viewpoint is.
Peters made it clear that he
does not condone the use of
drugs and that, after all, such
offenses are against the law.
But he also indicated that he
did not think the drug pres
blem here was getting any
worse although he admitted
that “People do n0t broad-
cast to me what the situation
is up here!"

After reciting the various
sentences and fines applicable
to drug and alcohol offenses,
he revealed to the audience
his secret plan to rid the
campus of all drugs. He will
quietly walk into the Forum

one night and whisper to ‘one
of them students: ‘There's
gonna be a raid tonight!’ And
listen to all the toilets flush. .
enough to causeawater short-
age!"

There were several queries
about Iowa's infamous Attor
ney General Turner and his
feelings about Grinnell. Pe-
ters denied that Turner had
it in for Grinnell at all, and
in fact noted thatTurner's only
comments to him were ”Well,
any more people taking their
clothes off down there . . .l"

As for town-gown relations,
the Chief said that a couple
of years ago they were at an
all-time low but that "After
last year, they're as good
as ever" and then produced
a couple of low, mysterious
chuckles. “If you hear any
rumors that they're going to
behead any college student
who steps across 6th avenue,
why call me," he said. “I'd
like to watch 'em do it!"
In all, Chief Peters seemed
to want to get along with the
college and its students. He
invited any student to come

Whon Concert In Aprille

by Jay Southard

Yes, there IS one in April:
an Orchestra Concert, that
is. There are also going to
be three other Grinnell C01,
lege Orchestra concerts this
year; one each in October,
November, and February.
Thus far, at least, this year's
Orchestra is the same as
last year's. But changes are
in store for the future.

David Montgomery is the Or-
chestra’s new conductor, the
third in as many years. To
a large degree he will be the
difference. No doubt many inn
teresting things could be rc-
counted of his life by a rea~
der of official blurbs. I, how
ever, threw all of those in
the circular file immediately
upon reception. As a member
of the orchestra myself, I
am interested less in where
he studied than in what he
plans to do here.

David Montgomery was broun
ght up on a tradition of come
bined European classicism
and American Jazz. Though he
feels that the orchestra is a
European transplant, he can-
not repress his love for it.
So much for his (simplified)
orchestral Philosophy. As a
result of his philosophy, how
ever, several basic changes
will be made.

First: if the orchestra-
transplant is going to die a
natural death at Grinnell, Da-
vid Montgomery is not going
to hire outside players to
revive it. Nor will he pres‘
sure students into playing,
nor Orchestra members into
practising. In short, the Ore
chestra will remain an ama-
teur organization.

If there is no pressure, Montt
gomery hopes to provide op-
portunity. He hopes to take
steps to include both the Grin-
nell College players andama-
teur musicians in the come
munity. Some of these steps

have already been taken. Mrs.
Irene Fudge, wife of Professor
Fudge of the Music Depart-
ment, has taken over the Grins
nell public school string pro-
gram. Various members of
the community have, in fact,
played with us in the past
"it does seem a waste for
a person to have to put down
his instrument when he leaves
school. There will be oppor-
tunities of another sort, too:
David hopes to conduct several
concerts with student soloists.
David Montgomery is only
part of the equation. The Or-
chestra is the Other part. It
is not a professional organi-
zation, so will the members
work as well if not under
pressure from the conductor?
The Orchestra this year is
smaller (a result of the no
pressure policy) and the re-
pertoire will be limited by the
size or the Orchestra.

David Montgomerywouldlike
to show us that Orchestral
playing can he as intimate as
chamber musicplaying. lthink
several orchestra members,
myself included, would like to
show ourselves that we can
play as well under our own
steam as we did when slaves
driven. Come see for yourself.
The first concert is October
1511': and 16th, in which the
Orchestra and the Grinnell
Choral Society will perform
Mozart’s Requiem.

cluded by noting that “You try
to hold your bad ones down
up here, and I‘ll try to hold
our bad ones down down there,
and we should get alongfine.”
After ChiefPeters’ "presen-
tation" the Joint Board held
their replar meeting. Greg
'Ihielmann, Student Auditor,
explained the procedures of
the Auditor's Office to the
house presidents. A lengthy
discussion therefore ensued
in which Thielmann fielded
questions from the assembled
multitude regarding college
policy on funding housepart-
165.

The basic point of interest,
of course, was whether those
unfortunate individuals who
have a tendency towards in—
ebriation at such gatherings
are to be subsidized with col-
lege funds. Thielmann made
it clear that college policy
strictly forbids such funding,
and the meeting ended among
groans, whispered compl—
aints, and a few lcnowinggrins
on the faces of some presi~
dents.

Theater Productions Begin Soon

by Charlie Read

Mrl Sandy Moftett, chairman
of the theater department, with
Mrs james Reader, Mrs. Bets
ty Voertman, and Mr. Bruce
Halverson, has started the
1971772 Grinnell year with a
massive enrollment in theater
courses. Both Moffctt and
Halverson are new to the de-
partment.

The main alteration in the
theater curriculu, this yearis
the separation of the former
“Acting and Directing"cour
rse into "Fundamentals of
Acting" or "Fundamentals of
Directing". A planned ad-
dition to next semester’s sch-
edule will be an advance cout
rse in acting.

The department’s first for
mal theater production will
be the “Taming ofthe Shrew",
October 21723. »\ll students
will be welcome to try out
September 9 and 10. Those
interested in the position of
stage manager or assistant
director for this play should
talk to Mr. Moffatt as soon
as possible. A shop foreman,
lighting assistant, costume
men, and Others will be

ber of credits. He also said,
"Many students complain that
grades create unreasonable
and irrational competition."
He suggests that students be
allowed to take a course as
a group, and be graded as a
group and not as individuals.

Marilyn Mulligan
Marilyn Mulligan also has
some definite plans. "Oneim-
provement might be more in-
tensive, fewer courses. An
eight hour politsci course
could take field trips, say,
during an election year."Ma-
rilyn said too, “The commits
tee should be moderate in tone
and not swayed bysocialideas
in vogue. It has to be able
to see what the long range
effects are too.”
Leroy Nash

Leroy Nash claims he has
thought about the issues. He
would like to see no grades
and more unstructured cour-
ses, and would like to ”take
off some of the pressure that
graduate school forces on the
liberal arts education."

Al Rosenfield

Al Rosenfield would IiKe to
see the subject of "folklore"
added to the English or possi-
bly history curriculum, hiring
a folklorist if possible. Ron
senfield would also push for
the addition of elementary
school certification in the edue'
mtion department, and would
also like tohelp strengthen the
psychology department.

Torn Safely
Tom Safely claims he has
"an active interest in the edu-
cation at Grinnell. I'd like to
have a say in the policies
affecting my education."

Steve Sklore

Steve Sklare feels that work
can be done on the Freshmen
tutorials since there are no
options available on the cre-
dit-fail status. He feels much
more discussion should have
been held on them originally.
Steve also said, "I think the
whole course load should be
able to be taken credit—fall,
not just eight credits.”

Skip Tredway

Skip Tredway smted, “I‘d
like to see more interdisci-
plinary courses so thata
course isn't seen from just
one angle, like a European
history/civilization course or
a science/history one." He
added, “I also think course
scheduling needs improve-
ment because often similar
courses are put in the same
time slot and creates conflicts
if you want to take more than
one."

Ellen Yocknin .

Ellen Yack‘nin would like to
see gradingbased on improve~
ment rather than competition.
"It would be a lot harder on
the profs. but I think it would
be more fair to the students.”
She also feels that a better
grading system is needed be
cause “the credit~failis meat
ningless right now."

needed by the production crew
under Mr. Reeder. For each
play during the year, oppor-
tunities for new crews will
be open.

A new program connected
with the theater department
has been set up...Open Space
Productions. Any individual
or group wanting to or-
ganize readings, skits, cont
certs, "happenings”,orwhat-
ever can have the use of
Arena Theater at 4:30 to 6:00
on Fridays . . . if the pro
gram is approved by and has
the permission of one or more
of the theater staff, Indivie
duals will then sign up for a
date to use the theater. Per~
sons may approach the theater
staff at any time with their
suggestions for programs.
Workshops on the technical
aspects of the theater, suchas
lighting, set construction, and
costume design will be held
at the Fine Arts Building Se-
ptember 2 r 14. Because those
students enrolled in certain
theater courses are required
to attend, the number of out-
side persons allowed to at
tend is limited.

Other theater productions
are "To Kill a Mockingbird”
December 274 and a dance
concert March 3 and 4. The
last production of the year
will probably be a musial
although plans are not defi-
nite. Another tentative plan
for next spring is a touring
show.
