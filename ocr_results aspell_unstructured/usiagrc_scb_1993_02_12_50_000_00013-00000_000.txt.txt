Hallie Flanagan and the Federal Theater Project

‘ ’ ’HAT’s black and white and red all overt7 If one had
asked the familiar riddle of certain US. Congress
men during the late 1930s, they might well have

answered, "The Federal Theatre Project!"

Created during the Great Depression in this country and
inspired by a vision extending far beyond that difficult period,
the Federal Theatre Project was one of the four arts projects
under the Works Progress Administration, a program launched
in 1935 to put people back to work. Hallie Flanagan was the
national director of the FTP. I—Iarry Hopkins the administrator
of the WPA.

Both Flanagan and Hopkins grew up in Grinncll and
graduated from Grinnell College, Flanagan (then I—Iallie
Ferguson) in 191 1. Hopkins in 1912. Both are reported to have
been inspired at Grinnell by dte idealism espoused by the
college‘s president at that time, John H.T. Main. In the lives of
both, some commitment to social and economic justice was
always present.

Not long after Ferguson graduated from Grinnell, personal
tragedy struck. with the death of her husband in 1919, and her
older son in 1922. With an astounding perseverance in the face
of difficulty and a passion for the theatre, she rose above these
circumstances

She returned to Grinnell College to teach and began to
make herself known in American theatre.

She studied with George Pierce Baker in his Harvard 47
Workshop. soon becoming his assistant. She took apesition at
Vassar in 1925. and within a few years made its Experimental
Theatre famous. Her book Dynamo tells of her Vassar years.

Flanagan was granted a Guggenheim Fellowship in 19267
27 (one of the first women to win this award) with which she
studied theatre abroad, notably Russian theatre. She published
an account of her travels in Shifting S carter.

In 1935, she took over the grand humanitarian and cultural
experiment of the Federal Theatre Project,

The vision and the organization of the FTP were largely
Flanagan's. While the reason for the Project's formation was ID
put unemployed theatre professionals back to work, Flanagan
also insisted on quality productions.

The nationwide theatre was to be federal, i.e,, a central
administration would oversee the Project, but the various re-
gions were to develop their own programs. including the
writing and production of plays about local material. Harry
Hopkins pledged that the Project's activities would be "free.
adult, uncensored," but almost immediately the FTP battled
censorship.

Inevitably. the political center of the F1? was in Washing-
ton, D.C., the hub ofproduction activity in New York City. A
number of regional centers were designated.

Regionaldirectors were appointed,andunits setup in those
states with a significant number of unemployed actors. A
National Service Bureau in New York City coordinated the
reading,writing,andasscssmentofplays,and sentoutavailable
personnel, equipment, and materials where needed.

Iowa qualiﬁed for a small unit, but power struggles be-
tween the state WPA director and FTP personnel impeded its
development. The Iowa unit lasted only from 1937 to 1938.

The scope of the FTP was vast and complex. Productions
included classical repertoire, new and experimental plays,
plays in different languages, musical revues, vaudeville, marir
onettes,children's theatre, dance, the circus. and living newspa»
pers. a documentarydramatic form that became identified with
the FTP. The Projectoffercd serious roles for blacks and other
minorities, and new opportunities for women playwrights.

Neverquictly established, always in jeopardy about fundr
ing, inevitably controversial because of the turmoil of the
period, the FTP nevertheless slowly gained the approval of
critics. By 1936, the LiremryDigen reported that "the greatest
producer of hits is the Federal Government," and Scribner’:

Magazine stated that the Federal TheatreProjcet was Lhe ”chief
producer of works of art in the theatre."

The FTP, under the guidance of Flanagan, became a
theatrcof, for, and by the people. In addition to encouraging the
developtnent of indigenous theatre programs, the FTP took
professional productions into parts of the country where audir
ences had never before seen live theatre. Admission was free

munism within the FTP. That perennial fear about immorality
in the arts also surfaced.

Flanagan's association with Russian theatre was repeat-
edly, and unfairly, brought before the public. Newspaper
headlines proclaimed her a "WPA Red."

Flanagan. who With her associates had prepared an exten-
sive and well~documentcd brief, was allowed to testify only
once. A Committee member.l. Parnell Thomas ofNew Jersey,
acknowledgedto her: "chon'twantyou

Today, the major archives for the

sity, Fairfax. VA. The collection is over-
seen by Lorraine Brown. professor of
English and American Studies at the Uni-
versity. who found the collection in a
hangar/warehouse outside Washington,
D.C. in 1974.

In 1991, Brown and the Institute on

social concerns 7 increasing mechanization of
life and a person who had little voice in society; its

author was a woman. Interesting parallels exist
between Treadwell and Flanagan themselves:
Their lives spanned almostexactly the sameyears
(Treadwell, c. 1890—1970; Flanagan, c. 1890—
1969); they both had dynamic and inﬂuential
public careers, not typical for women of theirday:
both were inﬂuenced by experimental and revo-
lutionary theatre of the time, notably that emergr
ing frompre— and postrrevolutionaryRuSSiﬂ. Each
took liberties with her birth date!

In a sense, Flanagan and Treadwell will meet
on the Grinnell campus Febmary 2528 when the
Deparment of Theatre presents Machinal, di-
rected by Wendy Knox ‘79, in Flanagan Arena
Theatre. Performances will begin at 8:00 each
evening.

With her perseverance. administrative ger
nius, and theatrical acumen, Flanagan kept the
FTP intact for four tumultuous years. As one
regional director after the other resigned in frus-
tration.Flanagan continued on. In 1936, when E.
C. Mabie, Midwest Director from the University
of Iowa, resigned, she wrote to him, "I have
decided to stick it out, no matter what happens . "

She did more than "stick it out." Flanagan
and her corps made plans to expand productions
and to build new, genuinely public theatre facili-
ties around the country. Until the hour of the
Project's demise, these plans were being devel-
oped.
