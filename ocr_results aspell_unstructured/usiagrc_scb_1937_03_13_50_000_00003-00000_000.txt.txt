Predicting that some day the
United Slmes u'l take its full
share of i'espon. hility and duty
as a member or a world society,
w, Arnold-Forster concluded his
series or eight lectures Thursday
night saying he eagerly looked
forward to that day.

Speaking on “The Price of
Peace," the British lohoritc pointv
ed out that tlieie are several
choices open to both Great Brit-
ain and the United States tor pre-
sorving notional peace. For his
own nation he believes the return
to a collective peace system to he
inevitable, “Rebuilding- thc Leas
gue of Nations is the only method
of preserving peace and justice
for all," he said

Obligation Not clear

"But for the United States l‘ the
speaker continued, “the obligation
0‘ choice is not so clear. Out-
ll ng methods by which Ameri-
cans could give cautious hut efs
tective cooperation to European
powers, the Englishman exclaim-
ed, “What could your President
do in the next four years toward
preserving international peace,
with his tremendous hacking!"

The United states could enter
the League of Nations, he pointed
out, with the provision that no
American troops would he dis-
patched oiitside of this country; it
could undertake to confer with
others in times of crises, and
maintain a discriminating embar~

could enter the World court: it

other choices open to the Unit-
ed States, besides the policy of
cautious cooperation as outlined
by the lecturer, include disarmed
isolation, which he dismissed as
improbable, armed isolation.
which he described as ineffectual,
hiirdensome, and dangerous: EXT

were out of the question for this
country unless for on allied

Noted Metropolitan Opera Star

ﬁnds Luckies easy on her precious throat—

Marjorie Lawrence says:

"You must have a big voice to sing
Wagner. My favorite role of 'Brunn-
hilde’ in Wagner’s ‘Gotterdammer—
ung’ is a very exacting one. Yet-
when I am back in my dressing room
after I have ﬁnished singing, there is
nothing I enjoy more than lighting
up a Lucky. It is a light smoke—so
gentle—so smooth—that it does not
irritate my throat in the least. I ‘agree
wilh the others at the Metropolitan.
that a light smoke is a wise choice.”

BRILLIANT SOPRANO OF THE
METROPOLITAN OPERA COMPANY

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Lawrence veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies.You, too, can have the throat pro
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain

harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
“It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
