something about Gl'lllllell. that distill
guishts her from other colic, s: that
distinctly Grinuell; that is the gene
umc ulloltsolllc atmosphere hero.”
“Another thing it hich impresses inc,"
De Hoop went on to stir. ”is the
spirit of democracy at Grillnell.’ He
told how that spirit “as choked at
many other colleges and universities
that he has visited, by iraternities and
other
individuals attention to the group
rather than to the whole. He express
ed satisfaction that there was at Grins
poll no inlluenco which would tend to-
Ward the narrowing of the life of the
students and do away with the spirit

. or democracy which he ielt here.

Mr. De Haan spoke of the compara-
tively rapid material development
which has taken place (It Grinnell with-
in the last row years, and said that

' many of the alumni are fearing that

with this development might come a
loosening up on the deeper things and
that some of the traditions «or which
Cririnell had stood might be lorgotleu.

“However, l iccl that Crinncll is
keeping pace in its spiritual develop»
menl. with its material development,"
he said. and expressed the pellet that
this would continue to he the case.
He also spolrc with srtislnction ol the
provision made on the faculty ior the
teaching of religious sulijccls.
