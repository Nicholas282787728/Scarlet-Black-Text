Marcia Freedman on
Judaism and feminism

by Scott Hildula

On February 9, Marcia Freed-
man gave a convocation lecture
on “Jewish Feminism: Its
Sources and Its Future." In the
lecture she outlined the history of
the patriarchal system or worship
found within the Jewish religion
and its impact on the role that the
wife has within the family,

The Jewish feminist today,
while not in as poor ofa position as
other times in history, still must
work to be recognized on an equal
level. within recent times women
have been ordained as rabbis and
have set up some oi their own
forms of worship rituals which
had in the past excluded them as
women. Uniortunately, the
feminist movement in Israel ton
day has been side-tracked by the
peace movement. There are,
however, efforts being made on
behalf of the Jewish woman

The following Sails interview
with Ms. Freeman was obtained
after the convocation:

5&3: Do you think the average
man ieels threatened by the up
surge in iemalc militancy'.’

Freedman: I think he should, I
think it would be Crazy for a
capitalist not to be threatened by
organized labor. I think whites

during the civil rights movement
of the ’605 would have been foolish
not to be threatened.

Anytime the Status quo of the
class in power is under challenge
there is bound to be change — and
not to the advantage of the domi-
nant group, They will have to give
up part of their privileged posi-
tion,

5813: There has been some con-
troversy on campus to the eiiect
that a woman must make a com-
promise between being sexy or at
tractive and being a conscious
feminist. Do you feel that such is
the situation?

Freedman: One must think first
about the standards of beauty that
have been established during the
course of history. Consider the
Chinese custom of binding a
woman's feet, Not only did it give
her small feet but it left her vir-
tually unable to walk making her
very dependent on others. There
are oi course examples in Western
Culture which, while not so exV
treme, are founded on the male
ideal of beauty. I therefore re
main suspicious of the ideals of
beauty which have come to us
from a male dominated society.

Telethon punicipunls have been working hard to riiise money
for Ihe college this week. Pholo by Mike William,

Telethon time again

by Jeff Raymond

Dialing for dollars in the latest
telethon is proving to be popular
among the students who are pars
ticipating in it,

Billy Strean, who is involved in
his second telethon, said, ”I think
it’s a really good cause,” He said
that among the reasons he is call~
ing include competing tor the
grand prize or a night in'a luxury
hotel or its equivalent in Cash, he
likes talking, the money helps oli-
set the gap between tuition and ac-
tual costs and calling is an easy
way to raise money.

“I did one in the fall,” said Scott
Preston. ”and it was really fun
and I decided to do it again, I also
iigured that rm on enough ﬁnan-
cial aid that I owed the college
something,”

The money raised at the
telethons goes into the annual
operating budget, according to
Virginia Petersen, who heads the
semi-annual event. She said that
the funds will support scholar-
ships, maintain salaries and oiiset
maintenance costs.

The event itself costs about
$8,000 to hold, but this money is
quickly made up. in tact,
Petersen estimated that over
$50,000 had already been raised by
Tuesday, She said that she ex-
pected the total to be between $80

 

and $100,000.

The average donation, actors
ding to Petersen, is about $50,
though the donations range from
five dollars to thousands of
dollars,

Six students serve on a commit-
tee which helps to organize and
run the event. When asked why
she was on the committee, Libby
Rohovit said, “I was asked to be
on the committee and really had
no reason to turn it down,” She
said that she had the time
available and wanted to get in
volved. The others students on the
committee are Jim Becker. David
Claiman, Royce Raymond, Mike
Silver and Tor Hough,

The student callers agreed that
while most people they contacted
were receptive to them, others
were less enthusiastic, Some peo-
ple had bad reelings ior Grinnell,
while others explained that they
simply were not in the iinancial
position to donate.

The callers also felt that the
poltiical overtones that some
students tend to associate with the
telethon were inappropriate.
Rohovit explained that telethons
are common and help to onset the
costs oi the operating budget, and
Strean said that he felt that the
lelethon was totally separate from
the policies of the administration.

 

shave it. I think that part of the
feminist emphasis on changing
male standards of beauty is very
good. It is very easy for a
heterosexual woman to feel the
strength oi those kinds oi sanc-
tions, Thereiore, I understand
that there are women who receive
a great deal of rewards from the
existing system and are not will-
ing to give them up.

5&8: what type of voting choice
do you see for women with the
slate of potential candidates for
’84?

Freedman: it you mean the
main stream candidates as far as
Democrats and Republicans, I
don’t see much difference bet-
ween any of them.

i think the best strategy is the
one used by the women suffraglsts
and that is a strategy of going
against the incumbent. This is in
order to keep the turnover high,
not allowing any one candidate to
become too firmly entrenched. it
is necessary ior women to do this
until they get what they want.

 

Local Republicans
prepare for caucuses

by Ellen Z. Piekalkiewicz

The Iowa Republican Caucuses,
February 20, have been given lit-
tle media attention, but area
Republicans have stressed their
importance in recent Scarlet and
Black interviews.

Grlnnell College student lan
McLean, who is a member of the
campus Republican Club, said the
caucuses are a good time to get
”input irom Republicans on what
they want (included on the plat-
form). . , because eveything is
open ior discussion."

Bob Anderson, County Chairs
man oi the Republican Party, said
he “hopes people will turn out
because there will be a freedom oi
discussion” on topics such as Cen-
tral America, the nuclear freeze,
ERA, and Social Security.

In conjunction with other

members or the American
Lutheran Church, Anderson has

already submitted a resolution to

German journalist
Visits Grlnnell

by Brad Vandcr Lindcn
West German Correspondent
Ulrich Schiller stopped in Grlnnell
last week to interview townspeo
ple and college students about
Monday’s upcoming Iowa
Caucuses. Schiller reports for six
West German television stations
and the weekly newspaper, Die
Zcit. which covers economic and
political news in West Germany,
During Schiller’s current
travels around the state, he has in»
terviewed different Iowa political
figures, including Democratic
State Chairman David Nagle and
Republican State Chairman Rolf
Craft. In Grinnell, Schiller talked
with various county and student
political organizers and members
of the Grlnnell College faculty.
“What I’m here to explain to my
readers and listeners is why
things happen as they happen.
The Iowa Caucuses keep becom»
ing more and more important. in
1972, it was the first time anybody
took notice of it [the caucuses]. In
1976, it was more important and in
1984 you’re going to have an ac
ting President here for the

Republican Caucuses." said
Schiller in a Scarlet and Black in
terview last Wednesday,

Schiller first visited Grlnnell
under the auspices oi the interna-
tional Communication Agency in
Washington, D,C.. in 1975, after
Grlnnell Herald-Register Al
Pinder invited a group oi ioreign
correspondents to Grinnell,
Schiller was last here in 1981. cola
lectlng material for a special
assignment documentary that
aired on West German television

During his 1981 interviews with
students. Schiller predicted
American opinion would shift
against the Reagan Administra-
tion’s economic policy. In the 5&3
interview last week, Schiller
revised his assessment. saying
that Americans may well reelect
president Reagan.

“This country is in a love affair
with Ronald Reagan, He's a nice
guy and considered to be very
sympathetic. But in some aspects
people do not make distinctions
between his personality and his
politics,” said Schiller.

suggestion trom Raffael Stein that
the position should not have been
open only to C.S.P, members,
Hautzinger withdrew his nomina»
tion, and a motion was passed to
open the position up to the entire
campus. l-lautzinger said later in
an 5&8 interview that “I never
promised him the position — i
don‘t know where he would've got-
ten that from,"

Earlier in the meeting, a letter
to be sent to the iaculty concern
ing the Jones Proposal was
debated, amended, and approved,
The final text, to be read by Haut-
zinger at the iaculty meeting this
Monday, is as iollows:

- “S.G.A, is enouraged by the
new, more reasonable approach

to curriculum change that the
faculty is now taking as embodied

by the Jones and Roth Pro-
posals. The vast majroity or us

would prefer that no changes be
made in the college's curriculum,

Given that some changes are

going to be made, it is our beliei

that the Jones Proposal is in
iinitely preierable to the Parslow
Proposal.”

John Scharii, S.G.A president,
mentioned several items mat he
and his cabinet had negotiated
with the administration and the
trustees. He noted that the student
activites iee will be raised by $6,
and that as a result oi his talks
with the administration, gravel
will be placed in the parking lot
behind Darby (to prevent mud
problems), and that an outside
basketball court will also be plac-
ed behind Darby.

Towards the end oi the meeting,
Ethan Cohen offered some resolus
tions to be voted on next week, in
cluding proposals to “disband the
so A. iunded security force”,
“condemn the userous practices
of the alleged Campus
Bookstore," and several others.

the county Republican Central
Committee concerning Central
America, he Said.

The resolution supports
dialogue between all parties,
especially in El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Nicaragua, and
“opposes covert and overt action
by the U.S. to undermine the
governments oi another sovereign
country."

The resolution, which was for
mulated by a group or members of
the American Lutheran Church
who visited Central America on a
study trip, will be a “heated
topic” McLean said.

McLean added he will speak out
against the resolution at the
caucus.

Guy Montag, head of the Grin»
nell Republicans, will be acting
along with Ian McLean as tem-
porary chairman of the First
Ward caucus. Montag said the
caucuses are “a golden opportunis
ty for students to get involved, . .
because the First Ward, which in-
cludes the campus, Will be elec-
ting 11 delegates.”

All the Grinnell Republican
caucuses will be held in the
Veteran’s Memorial Building at
834 Broad Street at 7:30 p.m.,
Monday night.

Montag said his group is not
working too hard on the caucuses.
but has started mobilizing behind
Reagan and Bush for the
November election

He said they will be doing a few
things on campus to encourage
membership in the Republican
Club and he hopes to get “at least
100 people” to join

Montag added. “Anybody can
be a Republican, . We are
stereotyped on this camus. . . Pear
ple here are so closed minded to
anything that isn’t Democratic,"

sial Roe vs, Wade decision,

Reubin Askew’s speech was
”political" to say the least, he
succeeded in avoiding every ques-
tion except those dealing with
abortion and the death penalty.
Several times during the dialogue
Askew appeared to lose the an
dience as he proceeded to go off on
tangents. Judging by audience
response it did not seem that
neubin Askew made a strong ima
pression at this Iowa campaign
stop.
