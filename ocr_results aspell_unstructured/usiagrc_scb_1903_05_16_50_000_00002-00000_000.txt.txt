Grinnell Meets Defeatﬁﬂ-a,

On Fridey otteruoon Grinnell met
her worthiest opponents or the season
nod wenb down in n worthy rlereut,
Although the results ot the game
were rather ilishom‘telliug', still some
good individual work was rlone and
we here yet much to hone tor. It is
safe to soy that Grimiell did not put
up her best bull yesterday. Much
better playlng has been seen on the
loenloinuuono. 1n the very lirst in;
ningn totality betell eumier Marsh,
who broke the bones in his lett hnnd
in n breve attempt at n boll, nnrl this
undoubtedly haul its rious elteet up.
on the team’swork. Grinuell found it
herd to locate Reese’s bells, but not
withstanding this some excellent hits
were obtained. Up to the sixth ins
ning the score stood Lwo to two when
with every bnserull otntnl or r not-
ted Ames three more tnllies, 1n the
eighth Grinnell ngnin seoretl, tin ole-
gant three bugger by Deshler in the
ninth again started the bell to rolling
and our opponents scored three more
runs. Swellnm nlthough at times no
steady played a good genie and it bebv
ter support hnrl been given the re-
sults undoubtedly would have been
oio‘erent. For Amos, Deslier and
Reese showed up well.
