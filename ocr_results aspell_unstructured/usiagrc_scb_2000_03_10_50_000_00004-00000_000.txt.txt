Movie Review: The Talented Mr. Ripley

By Joseph Michaels
Sioff Columnist

There are rwo exrremely compelling reasons ro see rhis
movic, namely Marr Damon and Bcsr Supporring Acror
nominee Jude Law. They borh give very compelling perfur»
mances rife wirh clever nuances rhar enable Lhcm io crcare

spellbinding score by Gabriel Yarcd. oh, ycsilhere's also
somerhing abour a co-srar named Gwcnyth Palrrow.

The movie begins wirh Tom Ripley (Damon) borrowing
a locker from a friend for a reciral. Hcrbcrz Greenleaf, a rich
businessmen, sees RlpIcy's Jacket and recognizes rhe college
insignia on ir aswherc his son, Dickie (Law), wenr ro school.
Hc approaches Tom, and rells him rhar he would gladly pay
him one rhousand dollars (a vasr amounr back in me fifries)
ifhe would go ro lraly ro persuade Dickie ro come back ro
rhe States. Tom, ofcourse, docs nor know Dickie, bur agrees
ro rhe rrip iiisr rhc same (how can you refuse an offer like
(hai???), and he goes abour srudying Dickie and learning as
much as he can abour him and his fiancee, Marge (Palrrow).
Tom engages rhc couple shonly afrer he arrives in lraly, and
he quickly becomes a pan of rheir lives. To rho audience,
Tom is an obvious oursiderand, ar rimcs, ii is almosr painful
ro rry and warch him hr mm a sociory he is obviously ill

suircd ior. Life is going well, despirc rhesc incongruirics
DickieandTom are becoming rho besr offricnds, he is living
wish Dickie, Dickie is raking Torn so you fcsiivals, andTom
is falling for Dickie. Wan. What??? Ah, yes, a mosr incon»
venienr love inrcrcsr, especially since Dickie is nor only cxc
ccprionally inrcresrcd in women, bur also, ir seems, mil-lei
uncomforrable wirh homosexualiry, So uncomforrabic, ir
secrns, rhar oncc lie and Tom finisii oiTTom’s paycheck, he
sees ir hr ro dismiss Tom from his life. By mid-ﬁlm, Tom
and Dickie have a disasrrous confronrarion rhar ends in
Dickics dearh (don'r worry, rhis is nor rhc climax!) rharTom
has ro copewirh for rbc rcsr ofriic film. Tom, our ofiove for
Dickie and his life, assumes Dickic's idcnriry which, oicoursc,
loads ro all sons of problems for rhe remainder of rho ﬁlm.

insrcad focusing on his srarus as an oursidcr. He handles rhe
role wirh an incredible amounr of maruriry and implores
rhc audience so emparhize wirh Ripley. When Damon

Law adoprs a perfecr American accenr and actually makes
his characrer, deplorable rIioiiin may be, look as arrracrivc

The film is easily one ofrhc year's besr, and is serrainlya

ir cngmsses rhc audience nor only in (he srory, bur more

rhe film would have rang flar and unrrue.
