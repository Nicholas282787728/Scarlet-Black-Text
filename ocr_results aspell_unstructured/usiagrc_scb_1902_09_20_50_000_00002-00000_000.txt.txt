ﬁlmy new students are
among us to take their-
places in the different classes and
do their part in makingtheliic ot
the college what it is. To these
Sim‘lz‘t is Bloc/c extends a hearty
welcome to the college atmos
phere and all that this means, and
we hope that each one will quick-
ly realize the old truth that one
gets out ot his college associa»
tions, largely what he puts into
them. The college life is better
than the life of the world outside.
in many respects. It is much
freer from the common vices, and
is morenearly ruled by the higher
and nobler aspirations. But to
get the best that iowa College
can give, the student must in turn
give himself, and it he does this
he will ﬁnd his time here well
spent. To most men and women
the years spent in college are the
happiest ot lite, though there are
many who wait till alter gradua
tion to realize how they might
have made these yearsstill better.
Although pleasant years, these
should be very serious, for all
those to come depend largely on
the way we usethc present. And
every individual contributes his
share toward improving the pres-
em or leavingit worse than it he
had never existed. In the col-
lege, the hesta man has in him
should come out. What each
does is more important than he
thinks. This should be a pros
perous year tor our college and
each can help make it so. Once
again we welcome all to a year ot
pleasant work.

@NCE more we would take

the opportunity to urge all
students to patronize those molclr
ants who adveltise in the college

organs. Look in the college pa—
pers andthe hand book and see

 

whose advertisements are there,
and then show these men that we
appreciate their support and ivill
in turn give them our patronage
The men who advertise in thc
Star/£1 6% Blade the Unit and the
Hand Book are responsible
merchants, who will deal fairly
and squarely with you in every re-
spect. Give them the patronage
they deserve.

sues of the Star/[l <9 Blur/e
