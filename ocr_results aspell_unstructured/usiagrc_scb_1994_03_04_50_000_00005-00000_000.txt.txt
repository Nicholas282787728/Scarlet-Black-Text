Organized Chaos makes John Zorn’s Cobra distinctive

By Dustin Key

HN Zom’s Cobra will be per
forming tomorrow at9:00 pm. in
Harris. Gctready, because even if

you’renotplanningonauending,you’ll
surely hear a wild story from anyone
who does.
Zom’smusicmimicstheepisodie
characteristics found on television. A
piece ofhis music will typically con-
sist of discontinuous short sections of
music, ranging wildly in genres, from
classical to cartoon music. Zorn ate
tributes his use of this style to his
growmg up in frontofa television and
living on Iheculturally blended streets
of New York. Zorn has illustrated the
discontinuity of hispieees by compar-
ing the different sounds of the sections
in his music to those heard while trav»

cling down a street in New York.
Zorn said,“My study, my life, the
world I dealt with, the traditions I felt
connected to, my heroes Harry Parieh,
Steve Reich, Ives, Stravinsky, Varese
--all these people I see as a line and I
see myself at the end of that line.
“Butpcople of our generation have
been exposed to more music than any
other in the history of the world because
of merocordingboom. Asakidllisiened
In my father’s jazz 78's, blues, pop, and
rock on the radio—>1 was really into surf
musiciand at eighteen or nineteen I
started suidying jazz saxophone. All of
these musics made me whol am."
Cobra never plays the same way
twrce. It isanimprovisution: the music is
madeupby theartistsas itisplayed, Zorn
makes the music distinctly his own by
designing a structure which contains
broad niles the players must follow; for

instance, a rule in which players must
imitateeaeh other'splaying. Rules most
often dictatewho isallowedtoplay. The
players may sigma] 21)!“ it” they desire a
newnilc, maintauiingthespiiitofimpro
visation and giving the musicians the
freedom to play how they wish, even if
they can’talmysplay exactlywhen they
wish.

Cobra becomes a game, since the
players are allowed to change the rule
by sneaking in a cue, bypassing Zom.
The music, in this way, becomes adv
venturous and as compelling to watch
asany competition. Each player com-
petes for dominance, trying to form
and control groups oflheband’s musi-
cians in order to increase their ability
to issue a cue, and thus, control the
currentrule of the piece. Zorn stated,
“The live conccn is not a record, it's a
game, a play of personalities.”

Dylan Thomas play is given treatment by Theatre of the Deaf

By Danya Leebaw

The National Theatre
oftheDmfperforrnsinGi-in-
nell this Sunday, audiences

will not find a silent stage, silent
actors or a silentaudience. Instead, a
professional ensemble of deaf and
hearing actors will present imagina-
tive theatre in twolanguages: Ameri

can Sign Language and English._

“These players remind us that acting
is a universal language,“ writes The
New York Times.

The National Theatre of the Deaf
(NTD) has been communicating in
unique ways with its audiences since
1967,whensixcunouspeopleattended
its first performance. The company
has received critical acclaim around
the world forits productions of classic
repertory as well as original works
expressly created for the company.
The NTD has collaborated with many
artists, including Chita Rivera and la-
son Robards. The company has ap-
peared on numerous television sper
cials, and regularly is seen on Sesame
Street. The NTD received a presti-
gious Tony award in 1977 for Theatri-

. cal Excellence and the Conneticut
Commission on the Arts Award in
1979. In I984. the NTD was one of
four national theatre companies repre-
senting the United States at the Los
Angeles Olympics Arts Festival.

The remarkable success of the
National Theatre of the Deaf may not
have been predictedby Dr. Edna Simon
Levine, a psychologist in the area of

deafness, who in the 19505 proposed
the idea of a professional theatre of
deaf performers. She approached the
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare, who took the idea to Broad-
way director Arthur Penn and actress
Anne Bancroft. Penn asked friend
David Hays, a Broadway scenic der
signer, to create sets and lights for a
pilot projectia theatre of deaf actors.
Hays and Bancroft uaveled to see a
student production of Our Town at
GallaudetCollegeinWashingtonD.C..
Hays found Sign Language in perfor-
mance to be beautiful and like “sculp—
ture in the air." Thepilot program was
never realized, but Hays‘ vision of

Almost thirty years after its first
