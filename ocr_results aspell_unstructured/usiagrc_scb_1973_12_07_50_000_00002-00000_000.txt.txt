Discouanare BillsBogged Down

WASHINGTON, D.Ci»rAn aide to
Senator Dick Clark(DrIA)said Morir
day that two bills passed recently
by the Senate to allow rerestab-
lisnment of special air discount
tares are “apparently languishing
in the House Aviation Sub-Commit-
tee.”

Pete Smith, Clark's press secre-
tary, said that he had been told by
the clerk DI the committee that the
two bills r- HR2698 and HR3859
er are ”pending, with no action sc—
heduled "

The two hills, which were passed
by the Senate in mid-November.wo~
uld allow air discount fares for
young people to be reinstated, and
would also allow discounts for the
elderly and the handicapped.

Air discount iares are currently
being phased out in line with a Cl-

Admissions Sugging

President Glenn Leggett and Dean
M the College Waldo Walker have
expressed concern over a drop in
applications ior admission to Gl‘in-
nell.

Walker told the faculty Mondaythat
admissions applications to date
appear to be about 40 per cent ber
hind last year.

However, Walker and Leggett said
that this may in part he attrioutaole
to the lessened pressure on per
pectiye students. They expressed
hope that the rate oi applications

Faculty lables

Grinnell’s iaculty Monday tabled
a proposal to tormalizeDepartmem
tal Educational Policy Committees,
alter hearing charges that the plan
was poorly researched.

The proposal, which was formul-
ated in the Faculty Organization
Committee, would have “request
(ed) that the mayors in each De-
partment annually organize a De~
partmental student Educational Poe
licy Committee which shall consult
with and advise the Department
Faculty on matter or departmental
educational policy.

A ccunter proposal put iorth by
the SGA Cabinet would have made
the iormation and iunctioning oi
departmental EPC's mandatory, and
would have responsibllty ior ”all
decisions regarding curricular and
personnel matters. "

Discussion during the meeting cen—
tered on the research which had
gone into the rec plan.

Under questioning irom Student
Coordinator Joe Genereux, Commlr
ttee ChairmanJohn Dawson admitted
that neither he nor the other memr
hers oi the committee had interr
viewed more than a handiul or peer
ple who had had direct experience
with the present ad hoc departmentr
al EPC’s.

instead, according to Dawson and

A group or students periormed a

Committee Plan

Committee member Gene C, Wubb» D
els, the proposal was iormulated
in response to the “prevailing cli-
mate oi opinion” at the faculty as
perceived by the Committee mem-
bers

Both Dawson and Wubbels raised
the point of an earlier faculty vote
against the establishment of a Com-
missidn on governance, and stated
that the Committee plan was in
line with that earlier vote.

However, a number otother speak-
ers indicated that this issue was
entirely separate Irom the issues
in the earlier Vote.

Joseph Wall, noting that ”it is
diiiicult to legislate lalssleIaire,”
made the motion to table the pro-
posal pending iurther study and re-
visions by the Committee. His mo-
tion carried 43-15-6,
