College begins athletic facilities expansion

BVJOHN Bust Scjal GARG

This spring the college will break ground on Phase II orthe
planned expansion of the school's athletic facilities, which will
include a brandenew swimming complex and a state oftlic art
fieldhouse.The new facilities will replace aging PEC facilities.
“We expect to finish completion of the athletic center by spring
of 2010," said Athletic Director Greg Wallace. ”Celtainly by
{all of 2011."

The new pool will be much bigger than the current pool in
the PEC. “We're going to be able to have 21 lanes whereas
now we only have six," said Erin Hurley, head coach of both

the men's and women’s swimming teams. The pool will be the
second largest in Iowa, after only a University of Iowa pool that
is currently under construction,

The new pool is intended to help cope with the largo de
mand of Grinnellsarea aquatic athletes and recreational swims
mers. “We‘re the only competitive pool in town," said Hurley.
"No one else can use the pool when we’re prncricing."

teams, water polo teams, kayaking, Grinnell high school teams

Students, administrators praise Dougharty

VP-Student Affairs brings history of progress, student advocacy, wool socks

BY Dilvlo Hr MONTGOMERY

Sine Anahitd, assistant professor of Sociology at the Uni-
versity oiAlasltneFairbanks, spent one year working under w
Houston Dougharty at town State University in the late 1990s.
Ten years later she is still gushing. “I can't tell you how wonder
fill that year was that I worked for him,” said Aliahita. “It was
deﬁnitely the most fulfilling year of my whole life."

This kind of praise is common in talking to former asso-
ciates and employees orDougharty, Grinneus incoming Vice
President of Student Affairs, In stints at lowa Statc, the Unis
versity of Puget sound in Washington and Lewis and Clark
University in Oregon, Dougharty has left behind colleagues
who gish about his personality and leadership. In 10 interviews
with students, faculty and administrators, the Worst thing any—
one said about him was that his sense ofhumor is “great," but
sometimes quirky,

Dougharry worked as the associate dean ofstudents at Iowa
State University from 1997 to 1999.While there,he is most res
membered for the work he did with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,

and Transgendel' (LGBT) Student Services office. Shortly after
taking ofﬁce there, he hired Anahira to head the office.

Jackie Blount, currently an associate dean at Iowa State,
talked with Doughnrty during his search, Annhita was “by far
the most activist and engaged oftlie candidates,"Blount said.“l
asltcd [Dougharty] .. , ifhe was ready to have someone who was
truly ready to change things on campus. He said, ‘or course.
That's what we need.”

Under Anahita and Doughai-ty, Blount said, the universlry's
LGBT program grew from a “tiny office" to a “major prcscnce
on campus,"

Dougharty led the charge to. e “site Zone" project at Iowa
State, and pushed it through against what Nancy Evans, then
a faculty advisor for the LGBT ofﬁce, described as an “initially
qultc hostile" reaction,

“Prior to Houston’s arrival here, there was very little vis-
ibility, very little attention paid to LGBT students," Evans said.

Lawsuit seeks to
stop ethanol plant

liv SARAH MIRK

In a few years,on a pareh of farmland outside Grinnell may
soon rise a controversial symbol of town progre557an ethae
nol plant. Six months ago, two Grinnell couples whose houses
neighbor the proposed development filed suit against the
Powcshick County Board of supervisors for rezoning the area
to allow the plant construction.

Ethanol (ethyl alcohol), which is produced through a pro
cess ofsngar feimentation and then distillation, is the substance
found in alcoholic beverages. Recent technological advance-
ments, however, have raised the possibility of using the sub-
stance as a fuel source This has led to the rapid erection of
plants across the agricultural Midwest, as one ofthe primary
sources for the sugars in the fermentation process is com.

Supporters of the technology say that it is a cheap and envis
ronmentally conscious solution to the nation’s growing energy
needs. Critics contend that the fuels potential is overstated and
that it is a poor alternative to other fuel sources.

The Grinnell lawsuit is one ofmany currently affecting the
construction ofethanol plants across the Midwest, as neighbors
raise concern about the environmental impacts ofrhe fuel fat?
tories, the declining price of ethanol, and the fuels purported
adtmntages to foreign oil.

The lawsuit, put forward by local transport company own-
ers Vernon and Lorena Van Wyk, alleges that the Board ofSu-
pervisors had insufficient public input and held illegal meetings
on the rezoning, which allows the construction ofa plant. In
September, a judge found that no illegal meetings had occurred
and dismissed the ease. The neighbors’ appeal is due by the end
ochbruary, and from there the team hopes the state supreme
Court Will pick up the case, the team said. Big River Resources,
the company contracted to build the plant, is delaying construc-
tion until the lawsuit is resolved

Sandy Moffett,Theater, sat on the Board ofSupervisots last
year and was one ofthe members to vote in favor ofthe rezon-
ing. Nloffett said he believes that the zoning argument isjust a
pretense and the neighbors' real concern is about the envimlr
mental impacts of the ethanol plant, both pollution and trafﬁc
and the visual impact ofa large factory on the farm landscape.

There are some potentially major environmental impacts of
the plant on the local resources; it will use as much water as
is currently used by the entire City or Grinncll. Alter inves
tigations, though, Moffett said he is not convinced the plant,
it run correctly, will have any serious environmental impacts.
He added that the waste dl?
charged from the plant must
be cleaner than the stream
it’s spilled into

Defenders of the plant
focus on the economic ben-
eﬁts the plant promises to
bring. “Instead of sending
our dollars to a foreign land
to buy energy, we’d be spend—
ing our dollars right here,"
said Richard Updegtaff, at-
torney for Big River Rcsources. “It had broad based supporr in
Poweshiek.“

Critics of ethanol, however, question whether the corn-
based fuel is actually a good solution to America's energy can,
ccrlis,“1t’s big, it’s ugly and it's emitting things which are not
very good for the environment," said Klish 13mm ‘08, who pres
sellted a MAP on ethanol earlier this year and blamed “political
overeenthusiasm" for rhc popularity of rhe fuel.

“Just as much carbon is released in obtaining ethanol as with
fossil fuels," said Batla. “It's not an independent energy source
because corn farmers rely heavily on government subsidies.“

While Mottett, a self-professed “liberal nut job," acknotvt
edged that com ethanol is not a viable long-term solution to
America's oil addiction, he voted in favor of the plant because
ofthe highepaying jobs it would provide. “I didn't see how me
as a supervisor objecting to this ethanol plant would get people
to burn less fuel,”Moffett said. “It was a complicated dilemma
but ﬁnally what I decided was this is a good thing for the
county This was a good industry, a clean industry."

”it’s big, ill ugly and it’s
emitting things whitii
are not very good for the
environment.”
