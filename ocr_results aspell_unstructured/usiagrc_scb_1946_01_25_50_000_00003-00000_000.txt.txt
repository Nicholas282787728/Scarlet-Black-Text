Housing Problems
For Vels Increase

Dean Earl D, strong Monday
voiced an appeal to the towns-
people or Grinncll to help solve
the housing problem for married
veterans wishing to enroll in
Criniicll college.

The college has applied to the
government for do housing units.
but there is no guarantee that
thcy will receive any, especially
in time for second semester stu-
dents, The housing committee of
the Anchors and Eagles has con-
ducted extensive correspondence.
but has received no satisfaction
yet.

Dean Strong urged the towns
people to throw open their homes
to those young couples. adding
that the collegc dining rooms
would be made available to them,
so that cooking facilities would
not be necessary.

Twenty-three married veterans
are on the waiting list for admis-

VSth at the present time.
