Top Soviet Ofﬁcial — the term evokes
the image or a larger than life figure and
becomes a rather overblown symbol [or
some undetined ominous force. State
Department rhetoric and traditional
misconceptions make it easy to torget the

. human qualities ofa person in such a posi~

tion, qualities Dr, Georgi Arbatov freely
demonstrated,

This is not to' say Arbatov, director
of the Institute of the USA and Canada of
the USSR, is just like anyone else. On the
contrary, he is an unusually articulate and
intelligent man who expertly executes his
job/But Arbatov encounters the problems

i is brief stay in Grinnell, that fact
beoome readily apparent,

By Tuesday, it was obvious that all the
scheduled activities were beginning to
take their toll. Between the pig toms and
classrooms, the man had not even lound
time to prepare his speech for that night‘s

resentation. In tact, Arbatov postponed

.this interview for an hour to do Just that.

Corning downstairs after editing his
speech he quipped “When you go to cut,
everything looks so good." Sitting in a
large arm chair for what looked like the
lirst time all day, Arbatov began to discuss
his perceptions ol Grinnell and its people,
a pleasant change oi topic lrom the pointed
questions of students and taculty
members.

Explaining the reason lor his visit, Arr
batov said, “I recelved this invitation at
just the right moment. I decided that next‘

Arbatov appeared surprised at mis
openrmlndedness and commented on the
students' “awareness of dangers of the
present situation and the sincere desire to
do everything to affect peace." Yet the ef-
fects or American antisdviet propaganda
on students did not go unnoticed.

“They are obviously under the influence
of the massive wave of bad things said
about the Soviet Union and its policies in
the last years " ArbaLov felt this influence

country. I decided I‘d like to go to Iowa, so

Most Americans don't even know about
Grinnell, much less Just drop in for a visit.
Arbatov had heard about Grlnnell and
some of its alumni, even though this visit
was his “first acquaintance with this part
of the country."

This visit was Arbatov‘s first exposure
to American students and he reacted
positively to Grlnnellians overall, He
found them to be "friendly, clearly bright,
eager to learn and ready to listen. l think
they are trying honestly to understand
what the other guy says and then form
their individual opinion.”

"was rellected in many oi the questions,
Not that they were irrelevant or unfound-
ed, but they were mostly a bit one-sided."

"Everyone gets mesmerized by the at»
lnosphere,” which he characterized as
“rather heated But I don't want to be
understood as disappointed; this is what I
could have expected."

Arbatov felt many people asked very
rhetorical questions in an attempt to make
some sort or politcal statement, others
were sophisticated and knowledgeable.
However, Arbatov believes that a United
states official speaking to Soviet students
would encounter "maybe even more
sophisticated and more knowledgeable
questions, Americans everywhere would

face many penetrating questions.” Yet, “I
think they [Soviet students] would be
polite, more polite than the people here —
no offense meant."

The number of students studying the
Soviet Union Surprised Arbatuv, and he
felt the interest expressed was “very good.
You do not often see it." He compared the
United States’ knowledge of the Soviet
Union with the Soviet Union’s knowledge
of the United States. “The USSR knows
something about the US. better than the
U S, knows about the USSR."

As Arbatov leaned back in his chair John
McCormick commented on his obVlOus
latigue. ‘Yes." he responded, “I have
been working hard " His face showed the
fifty-nine years, thousands of miles and
many long hours it had seen.

Reﬂecting on his stay, Arbatov stated,
"I have had very lavoraole impressions up
until now, knock on wood. But the best
memories are about the people."

The memories about the State Depart
ment are not quite so good. when asked
about the restriction on his association
with the media, Arbatov expressed regret,
“They lie simply, But I am a guest here, I
cannot make my own rules."

Overall, Arbatov seemed ramer
satisﬁed with his visit. “I am apcurious
person by nature. When one is very busy
and has the chance to see something, one
enjoys it.”

That statement basically says it all.
