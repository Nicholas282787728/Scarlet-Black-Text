Are humans natural, or
greater than natural? Once I saw
an advertisement on a cable T.V.
channel for a series of animal
videos; “Discover why we call
them animals," the announcer
snarled as footageof grizzly bears
attacking mighty brook trout
rolled by. The theory of natural
selection (”survival of the fit-
test") that changed modern Westr
ern thought, conflicts with our
perception of ourselves as the
“highest," most thoughtful anir
mal form. If with our big brains
we have survived on this planet
so well that we dare to dream of
coloniztng environments so hose
tile to life as exist in the vacuum
of outer space, we should be the
most brutal species on earth. It is
relatively simple to survive as a
one-celled organism: abacteria’s
life might be summed up as “Life
is short, then you divide.” Simi-
larly, there is much “room" as a
plant or an insect to try to create
an evolutionary utopia; since ev-
ery lifestyle strategy is likely to
bepreyed upon, the selection gra
dient created by prey and envi-
ronment are almost a freedom, an
invitation to try out funny ways
of mating and living. Our motto,
had we lived as plants and in-
sects, might have been, “Life is
short, then you diversify.”

By the lime predators and en-
vironment got around to allow-
ing humans to “choose" their own
evolutionary paths, then, there
wasn't much for us to do. We
semirchimps are not a very di-
verse group. Our source of en-
tertainment, then, must be the
analysis ofour own behavior, our

own helpless instinctl We like to
laugh, for example, at thebizarre
mating demonstrationsofourver-
tebrate cousins: why would a fe-
male prairie chicken ever go for
the puffing, strutting, display of

too. victims of our own natural
history, of long summers on the
African savannah and cold nights
with military comrades in ancient
Greece, of surviving smallpox
and surviving Stalin’s purges?
As humans, we would like to
dissociate ourselves from depen-
dence on evolution, and we tend
to emphasize the effects of our

environment and not our ances-
try. The more complex, evolu-
tionary, a creature becomes, the
more impossible it becomes to
attribute all its qualities to simple
calculations of survival and mat-
ing success. There is certainly a
danger in too freely interpreting
human behaviors like murder and
rape as solely linked to genetic
factors. We cannot deny, how-
ever, thatwe are still natural crea-
tures in that we can‘t ever hope
to understand ourselves.
Throughout human history,
people have classified others as
more or less natural. as more or

less “evolved” to their big brainsl
Gilman's book documents, for
example, attempts to classify first
women in general, the African
women, then Victorian era prose
titutes as Iess-than-human be-
cause they “conserved to greater
degrees the animal instinct to
mate.“ We are fascinated by the
“rawness” of nature, yetdesire to
classify the natural as that other
than ourselves. This action rer
veals both our position in the
“natural kingdom" and the dark
ness selected for in big brains.

Don't Let Popularity of U. S. Holocaust
Museum Prevent You From Visiting It

Washington BC. Museum flooded by more vistitors than expected

By Howard B Horn
read in the newspaper the
other day that they're turn-

Iing away visitors from the
US. Holocaust Memorial Mur
seum. More than 750,000 people
have already visited and more
than4,000 people try tovisiteach
day. The museumeanonly handle
4,000 visitors a day.

I’ve never been to the mu-
seum,but1think everyoneshould

visit it. There's a valuable les-
son to be learned from history,

and this is an excellent way to
learn about it.

A growing portion of the
population refuse to believe that
the Holocaustactually happened.
It‘s an easy thing to deny Who
wants to believe that one human
couldkill anothersomercilessly?
As survivors ofthe Holocaust die,
there are fewer people to explain
the horror from a personal per-
spective. Plus, Jews are well
known for their conspiracies.

I wish I could believe the
Holocaust didn’thappent Unfor-

tunately, I know better: I know
what happened to my relatives
who didn't come to America in
the beginning of the century.
Every time I see an old Jewish
man with numbers tattooed to his
forearm, I know. Itwas real, and
in the end, halfof the Jews In the
World were dead along with 6
million others.

Luckily, most people accept
the Holocaust as part of history.
The proof is irrefutablel AI~
though there are still a few survia
vors left, theI-Iolocausthappened

50 years ago; people cannot live
foreverl That‘s why this museum
is so important. It's a standing
monument that is able to explain
history without being silenced by
death.

Some have questioned why
we should pay so much attention
to such a gruesome part of his-
tory. After all, we‘ve made so
many positive strides in the last
50 years. Studying the Holo-
caust is stirring up bad memo-
ries.

The fact is we are still learn»

ing. Whether it‘s Cambodia or
the former Yugoslavia, there are
people who think that wiping out
a race based on who they are is a
good idea, They can and they
are. We need to learn that this is
not a good idea, and history can
teach us that lesson.

When you getsome free time,
go to the museum in Washington
DC. The lines will probably be
long, and you might need to make
reservations, but do it because
ignorance can lead to death.
