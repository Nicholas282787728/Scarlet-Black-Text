ger.

Each man will be given points ac.
cording to the place in which he
finishes. The team with the lowest
total score will be the winner. Gor.
don pointed out that while only the
first three men who finish for any
hall will be counted. a hall may enter
more than three runners in the race.

Extra Men Mny Help

All men who finish will be ranked
in the exact positions they come in,
so that if a runner is beaten by a
fourth of fifth man of another team,
whose score does not count on his
team total, he will be placed as he
finished regardless of the fact that
the other man’s points do not count.

Thus e‘xtra men on a team, who are
not among the first three from their
hell, can force other halls to lake
higher scores by beating the latters'
men. Each runner must have partie
cipated in 15 practices before the race.

Tentative Entry List

Following is the tentative entry list
released-by Gordon: Dibble—c, Mill-
er, W. Miller, Smith, Deisbeck. Clark

Sympathy for Garner

on the University of Missouri football
team, is disgruntled,

The other day the big-shots wh‘o
dabble in campus politics were search.
ing for a candidate to run [or the
office of vice-president of the student
body. These self.appointed campus
bigwigs got their respective heads toe
gether and, after the usual tobacco
smoke which characterizes all politi-
cal meetings, chose Houston as the
mosl likely candidate for the office.

And to make certain Houston would
win, they ﬁled his name as a cal-idi—
date and then closed the nominations.
Hence, Houston was unopposed and
was declared elected,

Naturally Houston was gratified to
find such an honor thrust upon him.
Not every man awakes some morning
to find himself a viccepresident, even
if it’s just of the student body of
the University of Missouri. He hast.

acquired position.

“Nothing.“ was the disappointing :94

“What do I do?” he wanted

“Nothing.”

"Don’t i get to make any speeches?"

“No,” ,

Houston returned to the gridiron a
sadder but a wiser man, “You can
tell Vice—President Garner for me,"
said Houston in a public statement,
"that. I know just how he feels. We
viec.presidents have a lot in common,"
