Office of Admission wrongly blamed for overcrowding

by Alexander Kambouroglou

For the past few years, the Ofﬁce
of Admission has been acusecl of
admiting larger and larger numbers
of studenls. Last year there were too
manydoubleroomsoccupicdbythree
freshmen, especialy in Younker.
There is also the problem of classes
much larger than what would be
concidered lo be ideal In a small
College like Grinnell. Is it the Office
of Admission that should be blamed
for this? A short trip to Moors Cot»
tageprovided the following statistics
that disprove the {ormentionod ru»
mots. In fact. it is clear that the
numbcrofstudcntsadmittedhas been
declining over the past four years:

It would also be positive for stu—
dents to keep in mind that the
Admission’s staff has to base deci-
sions on an educated guess: relying
on the number of students that have
applied, the number that have been
admitted, and the actual number of
students thatpaid the enrollment fee
in the past years, the Admission’s
staff determines the percentage of
applicants that are likely to attend.
Based on this percentageathe staff
will then admit the number of stu-
dents that will allow it to meat an

she never wants to see a situation
again inwhich cabinet members can-
not answer questions about where
money is going.

Relating her opinion that “money
wasmismanagedallaround,"Watson
said, “Without proper accountabilr
ity,Ifeelwc’recheatingthe students.
They had no idea where their money
was going.“ Watson believes that
this accountability can be achieved
by providing a structure for the con-
trol and documentation of SGA ex-
pcnditureand making surethat money
and billing»related matters be handled
through proper channels according
to a preset plan.

The executive committee, Brue
and Bob‘s assistant manager Byron
Johnson have received practical ad-
vice from Clay and McConnell as
they worked to devise the new struc-
ture s and procedures.

Clay described the role of his of»

free as that of a “consultant" or a
“hired accounting ﬁrm" employed
by the coffee house to help them set
up accounting procedures Clay
emphasized the necessity that Bob‘s
managementunderstandstatehealth,
workers' compensation and other
pertinent laws, and he an McConnell
have beenofassistancein that arwas
well.

Suggesting that Bob's Under~
ground would not longer be funcv
tioning had changes not been made,
ClaysaiddiatwhiletheUnderground
“was such a good idea," the enthusir
asmtogctthcplacerunninggotahead
of more practical and institutional
bttsiness concerns. The speed at
which the idea was made real al-
lowed too little time to solve some
basic business problems. "And
frankly,“saidClay,“itisabusiness.”
It must, by that definition, make a
proﬁt to survive.

Now thatthepeopleinvolvedhave
stepped back to assess the problems

of the early weeks, Clay said that it's
timeto”goalittle slowerso that there
is a measure of control.”

“l want the coffee house to be as
successful as it can be," McConnell
said. He stressed, however, mat he
and Clay are in no way actually ad-
ministering the business. “I don't
want anyone even to think for a sec-
ond that we’re running it."
McConnell, while offering advice and
expertise gained from 25 years of
experience in managing food service
operations, is insistent that Bob's
Underground remain a student—run
enterprise. If it were turned over to
administrative hands, McConnell
said, it would be Closed.

McConnell said that he isoffering
his assistance to the coffee house in
making sure it understands the ap-
propriate state laws and in acting as a
sounding board for the student mane
agers’ ideas and plans.

Speaking of profit, McConnell
said that the coffee house needs vole

time to survive. Were a situation to
develop where it appeared that the
Underground and the Forum Grill
were taking away from each other‘s
business, McConnell said that he
would probably close the Grill on
weekends or evenings. “I’d rather
see that the coffeehouse ﬂies. It
needs is revenue base."

The Grill operates on a “break
even" basis, said McConnell, but the
Underground must do much better,
He said that it could be 8 55060000
per year operation in gross sales, but
“we just don‘t know yet.” Watson,
Clay and McConnell all indicated
that there was really no way to know
where the coffee house stood finan-
cially after its ﬁrst month of opera-
tion.

According to McConnell, struc-
tures are now in place to determine
proﬁt and loss, product need, pricing
and losses from breakage or theft.
With this information at hand, the
managers will be better able to make

sure that the Underground pays its
own way rather than relying entirely
upon the SGA general fund for its
survival.

Bnte said that on April 8, Bob‘s
was “bom.” Now it’s “growing up."
Aided by Johnson, Bruc will track
sales, insure consistent supply of
products, determine need for new
products, and set prices, as well as
managing improvements on the Main
basement facility. Johnson, whowill
eventually take over as manager, de-
scribed part of their work as “devel-
oping an economic history of the
coffee house."

Brue and Johnson explained that
the Underground now has an em-
ployee manual detailing policies and
responsibilities, as well as a system
ofshiftleaderstomanagethebehind—
the-counter operations. Brue and
Johnson‘s work is primarily mana-
gerial, and they cannot do it well if
they have to always be waiting on
customers, they said.
