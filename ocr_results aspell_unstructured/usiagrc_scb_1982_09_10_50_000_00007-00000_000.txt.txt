by Jim Bickal

Field Hockey Coach Cathie Sdiweitzer
says she was pleased with Grinnell's per
formance in last Saturday's exhibition
contests against Luther and the University
of Iowa’s junior varsity. The games were
part at an umpire's clinic and consisted or
two 20—minute periods against each team.

Although Grinnell lailed to score in any
of the games, Schweitzer said She felt the
ball handling was quite good. Several
players were also encouraged by their perr
lormance, noting that in two of the games
Grinnell had many more shots on goal and
those games ended in scoreless ties.

The general sentiment of the team is

Women’s Tennis

Despite the loss of number one per
former Nina Ceri'olio and number three
player Melisa Sobalvarro from the suc.
cessful 1981 team, Women’s Tennis Coach
John Harvey says, “We could be just as
good as last year." The 1981 Pioneers won
the Midwest Athletic Conference for
Women championship and took third at
both the Associated Colleges of the
Midwest Meet and the Iowa AIAW Division
III Meet.

Elizabeth Calhoun, a ﬂireestime con
ference champion, leads a six-woman
veteran contingent. Calhoun, who will hold
down the number one spot in the lineup this
fall, posted a 124] record as Grinnell’s
number two player last season. She was
number two champion at the Midwest Con-
ference, ACM, and Iowa AIAW contests. In
addition, Calhoun combined With Cerfolio
to win the number one doubles title at the
conference meet.

The other returning letter winners are
Linda Berkowitz, Kathryn Zimmerman,
Catherine Welty, Laura Schoenbaum and
Sara weatherley. Weatherley copped the
number five Singla crown at the 1981
Midwest Conference Meet and joined with
Schoenbaum to capture the number three
doubles title. Weatherley ﬁnished with a
775 singles mark and Schoenbaum had a 64
record last (all,

that there is a lot ol potential this season,
Holly Larson, who is a co-captain this year
with Joanne Modica, says mis team is
more experienced that it has been the last
two years, in tact, there are more seniors
on the roster than any other class.

Larson also points out mat several of the
freshmen have high school experience, a
rarity in past year. Experience is a crucial
commodity in Grinnell field hockey
because a large portion of the team
members arrived here without ever hav-
ing played before

Volleyball

by Mark Osterberg

A large turnout that includes many ex-
perienced players characterizes this
year’s volleyball squad.

The team, headed by iirst year Coach
Sarah Brichford, is very optimistic about
the upcoming season and expects to im-
prove upon last year‘s record. The most
important factors in this expected im-
provement are the large turnout of 22
players, including nine ireshmen and six
sophomores, and the experience of the
players in intercollegiate or high school
action.

The team will be led by a “good, solid
core of juniors,” according to Brichford.
“With all the people out we should have
both strength and depth, especially in the
freshmen.”

The captains of the team are Denise
Walters and Kim Rieken and the J.V. caps
tains are Phoebe Leith and Sue Ann Dahm.
In the words of Rieken, “Our team is more
experienced and should do real well this
year."

This volleyball season will be one em-
phasizing steady improvement as the
season progresses. By midseason Hie team
expects to be doing quite well in con-
ierence play.

Men’s Soccer

Despite the loss of five starters, four of
them all-Midwest Conference performers
from last year’s team, Coach John Pfilsch
is hoping to field an equally successful agr
gregation in 1932. “We’re small, but have
good overall team speed and quickness,"
said Pfitsch. “Our first string defensive
unit should be as good as last fall. but we
lack depth. offensively, we should have
better balance."

friend Said ‘Why not give it a try. Just com-
pleting a pass can be rewarding.’ "

Larson, a senior, said she was “curious,
and it looked like an interesting, iast
game” when she decided to try iield
hockey [our years ago.

Newcomer Ann Nolan says she was
motivated to join by a desire for “exerclse
and the unique opportunity to compete in a
varsity sport." Each player interviewed
suggested that she has stayed with it
because oi the positive team atmosphere
and spirit.

He lauded Furth and Steiner as “the two
best fullbacks in the conference” and add-
ed, “Having them in the lineup is like have
lng two coaches on the field.” Both receive
ed first team all—conference recognition in
1981, as did goalie Donovan.

The Scarlet and Black posted an overall
8-3-1 record last (all and outscored the 0p
position 27715. They won the conference‘s
Southern Division crown with a perfect 4-0

Although Grinnell and Chicago are both
members of the Midwest Contest Con-
ference, the game will not count in the
standings. Under the loops current foot-
ball alignment. Grinnell is a member ol
the Southern Division and Chicago is in the
Northern Division. The Pioneers will be
seeking their third straight victory over
the Illinois club. Grinnell took a 3+24 deci-
sion in 1981 and a 21-13 encounter in 1980.

Although Grinnell dropped a 2741 non-
league encounter to Graceland in its
opener last weekend, oombrowski “feels
very good about our progress," He said,
”I'm optimistic about what we can do and
hope we can prove to ourselves in the
Chicago game that we can really play foot-
ball. We have the ability to score some
points and stop some people this tall."

Looking back at the Graceland game,
