TO A NEW PUBLICATION

In days gone by, the Malteaser published some of the best wit
and humor on the campus Indeed, Mdlteaser’s standard was at one
time so high that it was rated the tenth best humor magazine in the
nation and had something of a national circulation.

After a time, however, editors were elected who had not the pow-
ers of discernment their predecessors had, it became more and more
difficult to find good material, and the high tone of the magazine he—
gan to drop. This situation, coupled with financial trouble, caused the
local chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, the magazine's sponsors, to cease
publication about two years ago.

Nearly everyone agreed that the right thing had been done, but
at the same time Grinnellians felt the loss of the magazine. True, two
publications were still being put out on the campus. The Tanager and
the Scarlet and Black, but there were many literary efforts which be»
longed in neither.

Current rumors indicate that plans are being made to start a new
publication here.

The magazine, as we understand it, would be essentially a humor
magazine, but included in it would be some pictures, feature stories,
some poetry, cartoons, and occasionally a short story. A publication of
this type would, we feel. more than fill the position formerly held by
the Malteaser, especially so since the bulk of the material would ori-
ginate on the campus.

To the hackers and the editorial staff of the proposed magazine,
we wish the best of luck possible, and we hope that you may never
have to lower your aims by accepting inferior material.

LET’S HAVE A SONG

Dr. and Mrs. Edward A. Steiner announce today the establish.
ment of an annual award for a freshman song, While the freshmen
will naturally be interested in this opportunity to win 3525, we upper—
classmcn too have reason to be grateful to the Steiners

We personally can think of no finer unifying force than a class
song such as will result from this award. Looking at the results over
a period of years, it is easy to see that each class will find its own
song a powerful stimulus in preserving the Grinnell spirit. Likewise
the whole student body will find inspiration from the fresh ideas sure
to be embodied in each song.

For the freshmen and for the upperclassmen we thank the stein-
ers for this award. The goal is now before you, freshmen. Let’s have
a song.

GIVE US A BAND

Approximately twenty-five students reported for the second meet~
ing called for those interested in playing in the band. Such a state-
ment is a sad commentary on the enthusiasm of Grinnell students for
building up a band of which we can be proud. Pep rallies and other
efforts to build school spirit can never be successful unless we have a
band that makes a really good showing.

Last week the high school band, at the invitation of the college
played at the Cornell football game. One could not help observing
that unless the college gets busy and those who can play instruments
report for band practice, the high school will have a band that is
very much superior to ours.

There is no reason why, with the very capable director we have,
and the number of students who play instruments, we cannot organize
a band that we are not ashamed to claim. The college even provides
several instruments for those who do not have their own and who are
interested in joining the band, At this time clarinet, trombone, oboe,
and flute players are especially needed.

Too much cannot be said in urging students to report for band
practice. If you can play an instrument, prove your loyalty to your
college by joining the band.

NEWS OF THE WORLD
INTERPRETED BY

‘ Jolili Spaulding

Hitler and Mussolini have met
their match in the person of the
weather man, In defiance of Nazi
and Fascist boasts that the sun
always shines when their leaders
appear, it rained in Berlin while
they spoke last week.

Reitcroting that the results of
his conference with Hitler would
be peace for Europe, Mussolini at
the same time admitted the pres-
ence of thousands of Italian "vol-
unteel's” in General Franco‘s
troops in Spain.

much combination of state-
ments reminds us that the World
war was the “war to end war”
and “to make the world safe for
democracy." Looking at the situ-
ation now we hope the present
Spanish war is not another "war
to end war” and to make the world
safe for any ”15m."

President Roosevelt announced
in his Bonneville dam speech that
we (the administration) definitely
expect to have the budget halal-lb
ed by the next fiscal year. We’ve
heard it before, but the unvarying

optimism is encouraging at that

Tire Ku Itlux Klan has decided
to take action against the tactics
of the “sit down” strike. Just as

Chief Justice Hughes, speaking
for the annual judicial conference
of senior circuit court judges, rec-
ommends the appointment of four
new circuit court judges and 12
district judges to relieve the con-
gestion in the federal court dock~
ets. Even this much of an agree-
ment with his policy should please
the President.

The Bl" ish calilnct has offered
to “recognize” Mussolini’s Ethio-
pian conquest if he will withdraw
150,000 Italian volunteers from the
war in Spain If accepted, the
proposition will make everyone
happy, except Haile Selassie,
whom even the English seem to
have deserted.

Associate Justice Hugo Li Block,
broke his silence last night to re.
pudiate his connection with the
Klan. Now it is settled in a man-
ner befitting a justice of the Su—
preme Court.

In San Fransisco nearly a hun-
