Our ﬁrst impression of this place
was not exactly pleasing. or course
you have read a lot about the camp.
Everyone writes about the sand and
the mountains and the centipedes. I
can only say what I have told every-
oneithat it is about what we ex-
pected; perhaps a little more pleas-
ant. After you get settled, with a
good street, and a board door and
side walls ior your tent, you con-

Our intensive drill has started now,
a program for sixteen weeks, com—
posing gun drill, eouitstioii, pistol
drill and various other things con-
nected with this branch of the ser-
vice. or course every fellow boosts
his own particular branch, or soon
transfers to the one he fancies. I
am more than satisﬁed with the ar-
tillery, with the bunch of men we
h'avc. and with our otficci-s.
Woili Is Interesting
On)‘ work i' nteresting, and the
bunch are going alter it with no

something besides merely military
drill, too. Personally I don't think a
fellow needs to bury himself while
he is in the scr 'ce. ‘
