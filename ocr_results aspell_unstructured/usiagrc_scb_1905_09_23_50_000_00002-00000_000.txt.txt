O the new instructors who fertile
ﬁrst time appear as members of
the faculty we wisli to extend the
hand or welcome on hehali or the stu-
dent body. Several of the instructors
are graduates of thisinstitution and so
are acquainted with the ideals and
traditions. To them it is merely a
home coming, But to the others who
are strangers we assure you that Grill-
nell is a ﬁne place to live in. In fact
most or us think that there is no bet-
ter place on earth, As for the students
you will always ﬁnd them ready to
meet you hallway. We expect many
things from the new men and women,
and have no doubt but what our ex.
peetations will be realized. The stu-
dents are ready to assist you ii you
but give them the opportunity. Again
we say weloornc, and thrice welcome
