On Wednesday, Dec. 10in Arena
Theater," the members in Jonathan
Chcncttc‘s electronic music course
performed their own original come
positions that were the culmination
of a semester of studying computer
enhanced and computer
generated sounds.

What distinguishes elec-
tronic music from any other
type of music, according to
Chenette, is “the fact that
any conceivable sound can
be recorded into the musi-
cal fabric...The range of
sound colors you can corn»
bine into a piece is vastly ex-
tended."

Jonathan Knipping ‘99, a

member of the class. saidr

“[Electronic music] is sol
vast, the possibilities are so ‘
limitless, that it's mind-bog— l
gling sometimes.” »
The purpose of the
course is to make students
familiar with computer
technology by having them
compose three pieces utiliz-
ing different techniques.

vThe students learn how to

use the computer, various
electronic keyboards. sound
modules, effects devices.
and synthesizers. The stu-
dents worked with ”pre-
packaged" synthesized sounds as
well as sounds they either down-
loaded off the internet or recorded
themselves, sounds such as the chirp

‘ing of cicadas and a paper towel rub-

bing against an unshaven face. The
pieces performed on Wednesday
combined and switched back and
forth between electronic and more

traditional sounds that were edited

and reassembled by the students.

One advantage of electronic mu-
sic is that “a composer can work di
rectly with the sounds that will be
heard," said Chenette.

Steve McCaslin ‘99 agrees. “It's
easier than composing just for regu-
lar instruments because the computer

, will play it right back There‘s also a

wider range of instruments, so you‘re

' not limited by what‘s available.”

Another advantage, said
McCaslin, is that “[the composer]
doesn’t have to worry about if the

performer is going to get it right be-
cause the computer does exactly
what you tell it, when you tell it."
On the other hand. “You have to
worry about every last detail.“ With
other types of music “you can just
get down the general idea and the
performer can fill in the gaps, but a

sound, enliveniizg the composition process.

computer must be told every little
breath to take and every change in
dynamic.“

Since no real live acoustical in»
eruments are involved in the perfor
mance, “it’s not spontaneous," said
Andy Hicken ‘98. “You don’t re-
ally perform it; you just turn the
computer on. It's weir .”

However, Hicken said, the fact
that an entire composition can be
both written and performed by a
single person “gives you total ego-
tistical control over everything." But
Hicken also acknowledged the dis-
advantage of this aspect. “When
you‘re composing ahead of time.
you can’t really change it each time
you play it, like you could in, say, a
rock band. When you have total con-
trol, it’s just you, which can be both
an advantage and a disadvantage.
It's just a different kind ofthing."

Most of the class focused on the

technological aspect of composing
electronic music. “Most of what I
learned was more ofa technical skill
than really anything theoretical," said
Knipping. “I learned a lot about pro-
duction ofsound and recording, plus
mixes and the way computers work
like binary language and what not.
In terms of theory, we were
left on our own to do what
we wanted with our compo-
sitions."

Hicken said about work-
ing with computers. “They
can be annoying because
you might want to do some—
thing simple, but you can't
figure it out on the com-
puter."

Knipping said. although
computers can generally al—
low a composer to do pretty
much anything they'd want
to, “if you're not familiar
with computers and elec-
tronics, it can be frustrating,
too."

Sometimes the sounds
quality can also be a disada
vantage of working with
synthesized music. “Some-
times you can really tell that
it’s synthesized,“ he said.
“Especially with guitars and
brass you can tell that it's
fake." However, "There's
a lot more that you can do
with sound [on acomputer];
you can manipulate the wave form."

Electronic sounds can also be
combined with other media. Since
the sound is basically just a number
programmed into the computer, it
can be translated into, for example,
graphics or video. Music can be
turned into a visual or textual media
as well as an aural one.

“A large portion of the music we
hear today was electronically made
or transmitted," said Chenette, “by
computer, or on CD. or amplified in
concert. Almost all music will be
impacted by electronic media: there-
fore it's important for students at a
college like Grinnell to be involved
in applying electronics creatively."

”I will never believe,” he said,
“that a computer will replace the ex-
citement of a live performer, but I

don't see how music in the future
cannot be affected by electronic me-
dia when they are so pervasive in our
culture.“

do people think you’re funny, because I don’t?”

Can it be true”., Can this be my last
review? It’s so hard to let go, I know,
but it‘s something we all must learn
to do. I'm going tojust have to forge
on, write this last review, and move
into the next stage of my life. I plan
to go back to my roots as a regular
cynic (instead of a cynic who
watches bad movies).

Hmm, how can I describe this
ﬁlm, Austin Powers? I can describe
its targeted audience, I think. The
people who this movie was meant
to entertain are roughly cylindrical
in nature and made of a ﬁbrous, stiff
material. Yes, the targeted audiences
of this film are tree stumps. This
movie takes the cake for the most
idiotic piece of crap that I have had
the privilege to be paid to watch.
Michael Myers wrote, starred in and
possibly directed this film, and I
think we have diagnosed its problem
with this fact. Ihate Michael Myers
'almost as much as I hate Peter Coy-
etc, but for different reasons entirely.
I hate Michael Myers because the
man has absolutely no ability to
make me laugh. Iri Wayne's World,
the only one who could make me

. laugh was Ganh. Maybe my sense

of humor is jaded: I think after
watching some of the bombs we‘ve
had this semester. it would have to
be. Or perhaps it is jaded because]
know what tme comedy is: Collin
Bay. Now, a film about an annoy»
ing rich boy who ends up basically
a slave on a boat full of crusty oltl
ﬁshermen is something that] can get
into. Something that focuses on a
James Bond caricature from the 60‘s
that stars a man so narcissistic he
stars as the hero, the villain, and pos~
sibly even one of the heroines (rm

still debating that one) is just out of
my range of humor. IfI hear any-
one do an impression of his “Yeah.
baby, yeah" again, I fear I may be
forced to go postal. There is one bit
of humor in this film, and it is the
son of the villain, Dr. Evil. Scott is
a-typical GenX lad, and 1 identify
with his angst. Iknow how it felt to
have to watch such an awful, humor—
less, piece of garbage thatl wouldn‘t
even suggest as a treatment for in-
somnia, so I can imagine how it must
have felt to have to live the film.
Scolt was the character to whom all
my sympathy went.

If you like a film chock full of
poorly developed plays on the old
spy films, then I guess you might get
a laugh out ofthis one. Personally, I
would like a little more sophisticated
humor, like in Cabin Boy. You don’t
got any funnier than David
Letterman asking “would you like to
buy a monkey?" That is high com-
edy. But enough about Cabin Boy.

There is one gag in Powers thatl
found mildly amusing. That is to
say, my attentions turned from fan»
tasies of Myers in a burning house
to the action on the screen. They do
acouple ofinteresting scenes where
the characters are nudc. and some-
one moves a prop to intersect your
line ofvicw from their private parts
while the naked character frolics
around. I would have to say that it is
choreographed better than a Spice
Girl video, but not as well as a battle
in Eravelieurt. It does deserve some
mention for good effort. The female
lead being so close to nudity is bound
to bring some hoots, but any near
nudity of Myers will only cause
people to loose consciousness with

fear. If his chest hair looks like that,
what does his...

Now, back to some Myers bash-
ing. My dog acts better than this
man. “Did you do this? Did you
make this mess?" My dog can con-
vince me that the pile of crap in the
comer was from some phantom dog
thatI didn’t see, but Myers...I would
know he did it, because he's inca-
pable of helping me suspend my dis-
belief. Even the stupid looking teeth
he had just made me feel nauseous.
Am I being extreme? I suppose. I
guess I will just never forgive him
and all the others for doing what they
have done to Saturday Night Live.
Oh, I long for the good old days. “Do
not taunt the happy fun ball."

SO, we have two ﬁlms [0 take the
lowest score I can possibly dole out.
One made me laugh hysterically, and
the other did not. Too bad they
weren’t supposed to have the reac'
tions they did. Perhaps Peter Coyr

Gamelan (cont. from p. ’1) .

The group gave their first perfor-
mance yesterday, and plans to hold
a spring concert as well. More than
just a source of uncommon and ex-
otic non-Western music, the group
provides a non-academic way for
students to enjoy themselves.

people who enjoy producing a com-
plex musical product in a nonawrii»

m es-
ter in Gamelan," as he explained. “I
like it a lot. It's challenging for me,
partly because it is so different from
Westem music."

Hicken, cementing on his role
in the Grinnell ensemble, mentioned.
like Salzman, how the musrc “sounds
really alien, at ﬁrst, to Western ears,
since the instruments are tuned to

different tuning systems than we use
in the West." Hicken went on to tell
about how he is playing the
“sarong...bonang...and the slentum"
this semester. The sarong and
slentum are similar to xylophones,
while the bonang is made up of “hori-
zontal double rows of smaller
gongs." according to the Bali and Be-
yond web site (www. Bali beyond

The Bev Corner
— y Pam Vicsik and Aden Beihl

Since this is our ﬁnal column of
the semester, we feel it is approprir
ate to portray a positive image of this
program. We are thoroughly dis-
gruntled with the fact that the show
is so often defamed by the multitude
of people who refuse to pemiit the
righteousness of Bev to fill their
souls with peace and happiness. So
grab a beverage, sit back, and allow
the tales of the virtuous eight to
whisk you away from the hell of fi-
nals and into a state of bliss.

This week’s recent developments
include Sir Steve of the Sanders clan
making a spirited foray into the
world of stand-up comedy during a
special Amateur Night at the Peach
Pit After Dark. To invoke a forgot-
ten staple of eighties surfer slang, he
put on quite the “righteous" show,
exciting the crowd into effervescent
spasms of laughter. But his true
honor shone when he confessed to
his boner. The secret lowdown is that
because his onstage convulsing
failed to get the chortles he was ex-
pecting, he recited verbatim a rou-
tine of a famous comedian. His be
loved, the oh-so-toothy Carly, was
quick to recognize his valor and hon—

~ esty and rewarded his confession
with a kiss. Watch out Steve! A
quick jerk of her head could leave
you with a nasty gnashingl

David, in an unexpected display
of righteousness that diverges from
his traditional sinfulness, called on
the parents of a co-worker to aid their
struggling son. Benjamin‘s (the

long-awaited gay character) folks
refuse to recognize him as their son
and leave him to wash and wax cars
in a hostile environment in order to
survive. Leave it to the Knight in
Silver Armor to come to his aid.

Kelly finally confronted Dr.
Touchy on his impropriety in the
workplace. Ashocking twist, how-
ever, is that the usually honorable
Brandon is on the Verge ofinﬁdelity
with Emma and her Bangs. We're
pretty sure “B“ has got another kind
of“barig” on his mind, if you know
what we mean.

DONNA FASHION UPDATE:
For the first time this season, Donna
did not hate the crevasse between her
breasts. Could it be that she‘s hid-
ing something? Acne? Silicone
leakage? We can only wonder. Let
us just say. ”Thank you."

QUAD TIP OF THE WEEK: We
have but one more simple request.
Hold on to your dishes and trays.
The breakage rate of Quad table set—
tings is threatening to bankrupt our
beloved dining hall. Why is it such
a problem? Are too many students
jamming their hands into the may-
onnaise, thereby creating a viscous
layer of condiment lubrication? As
with all other Quad activity, you're
better off with two hands. Oh, and
one more thing: Smile at Darcy, and '
give her a friendly greeting. She
loves you.

ote could get together with Michael
Myers to do a ﬁlm? Then again, it is
