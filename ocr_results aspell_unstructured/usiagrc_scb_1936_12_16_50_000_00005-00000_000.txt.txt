College Employs 38 Per Cent
of Student Body on Various Jobs

Museum Dusting, Serving
at Teas but Few
of Tasks

Everything from dusting off the
dinosaur model's tail in the muse—
um to service at tees for visiting
notables is included in the work
which Cr-innell college students are
doing in working their way
through college. Thirty»eight per
cent of the student body is thus
employed.

Some put in their time drum-
ming up cleaning and shoe repair-
ing trade in the dormitories and
quadrangle, while others sit in the
music building at night to record
the students who practice.

Meat Cutters

There are student meat-cutters
and breadetwisters, electricians
and wood-choppers. student jani-
tors lay fires and put up Christe
mas trees as well as scrub and
wash windows. Assistants in the
zoology laboratory help prepare
slides, and some even kill cats and
frogs.

The National Youth administra-
tion program has opened up still
more Jobs for students. However,
those employed under the N. Y. A,
cannot be used for permanent
improvement of private property;
they cannot replace other labor.

Professor Asserts You
Can Prolong Life
by Watching Diet

Watch your diet and prolong
your life seven or riiore years.

That is the suggestion of Dr.
Henry C. Sherman, Mitchlll profese
sor of chemistry at Columbia uni-
versity and research associate of
the Carnegie Institution of Wash
ington.

His nutrition studies with rats
serve as the basis for the concili-
sion, The diet which extended the
prime of life in rats had an iri-
creased proportion of milk, making
the diet richer in vitamins A and
C, calcium and protein.

Dr. Sherman declared that this
food program “expedited growth
and development, resulted in a
higher level of adult vitality as
shown by several criteria and ex
tended the average length of adult
life."

The application of this new
knowledge in ”prime-period exten-
slim” is not only or biological sig-
lllﬂcance, he said. Most eminent
men attain their positions of “full-

-cst opportunity" at an age when
only the last third of their years
remain to render “fullest service
to the world."

nor can they be employed for work
of a non-public, partisan, or see-
tarian nature, according to Thee-
supervisor of em»
ployment. Dish»crew, waiter, and
other maintenance jobs cannot be
included under N. Y, A.
Assistants

Twenty-six professors have stu-
dent N. Y. A. assistants who grade
papers, do stenographic work, or-
assist in laboratories.

The wage rates for students em-
ployed by the college or by N, Y,
A. are about the same, although
the maximum under N. Y. A. is
20 dollars a month or 15 hours of
work a week. student rates are
deter-mined by the amount of re-
sponsibility, the experience
volved, and the attitude of the
student toward his work. Under
N. Y. A. these rates are established
every month, but rates for students
employed by college funds will not
be determined until after Christ-
mas vacation.

Statistics Show
Women Drivers
Not Inferior

New York, N. Y. (ACP)7Wornr
err drivers, long thought to be in
ferior to men drivers, do not
cause the most automobile acciv
dents.

statistics cited by FroL wile
liam Junkin Cox of Yale ulllver~
sity show that women drivers are
involved in only 3 per cent of the
highway accidents,

“But. it is not while driving
from either the back seat or the
front seat of the car that women
can exert the greatest influence
on the highway," Prof. Cox doe
clarcd. “If accidents are to he
reduced, it will be accomplished
through women. Men have had
the problem for 30 years and have
done little with it.

“Development of public opinion
toward an observance of law with
a view of decreasing automobile
accidcnts is definitely a work for
women. We all know that there
are about 40,000 deaths annually
from auto accidents, while 1,250,-
000 persons are injured from the
same cause.

"strictly impartial and certain
enforcement of law is one thing
needed and largely lacking to re
duce highway hazards. Public
opi ion for such enforcement can
be women's contribution."

Reporter Finds Relatives
of Famed Grinnellians
Now in School

College centrals at the beginning
of the semester were confused
when calls came in for Blair Macy,
Just which building was wanted?
Now they know that a man in
Clark hall and not a building is
wanted.

Blair Macy's greatmncle was
Jesse Macy, one-time professor of
political science. and the man for
whom Macy hall is named. But no
relationship can be established be-
tween him and the name of Blair
hall.

However, Macy is not the olily

hectic, excitable type. But actual»
ly, the student is under the weight
of many things which constitute
real worries.

“College students worry about
their studies and whether they are
pleasing their professors. They
worry about 'whethel‘ they are,
pleasing their fellow students and
thus are obtaining popularity.
They worry about their careers—
whether they will have careers at
all, They worry about the right
person to marry."

prof. Sears declared he is can»
vinced that the age of college
youth is not a “golden age.”
