Folkdancing relieves
stress at Grinnell

By Rhys Jones

As the semester passesby, and life
at Grinnell gets more and more hec—
tic, don’t you just want to bust loose
and dance? That‘s what about ten
people have decided, and under the
tutelage of Professor Barbara Stone,
that’s what they do.

In fact, they do it once a week on
Wednesdays, from 4:15 to 6:00 pm.
at the Harris Center, and they call
themselves the International
Folkdancing Group. They gather and
practice Slavic, Mexican, Middle
Eastern, French, and Eastern Euro'
pean dances in an informal setting,
open to students and faculty alike.

The Folkdancing Group is one of
thelongestexisting groups at Grinncll.
Founded over 30 years ago, it has
weathered theupsanddownsinpopu—
larity thatall groups suffer, and now
membership isagain on the rise. Origi—
nally, when there were no Varsity
Women‘ssports in existence, females
primarily attended, bringing boyr
friends whenever possible. As the
times changed, International
Folkdancing became quite popular in

its own right. Most of the dances are
highly aerobic and seem to be a
soundmeans of exercise. At the meet-
ings, the group spends about half its
time practicing previously learned
dances and steps, and then they learn
new ones from Ms. Stone.

In the past they have done Slavic
Troikas, which are linc dances in-
volving a human “threading the
needle" procedure and much mn-
ning; Mexican Polkas, a dance done
in pairs, as Well as various other
dances, including some traditional
American folkdancing, and more re»
cently some French line dances.

Not all dances are done in groups,
however. There are certain dances,
such as the Eastern European goat
herdcr‘s dance, which are done indi»
vidually. There is even a dancewhich
should appeal to the average Grinnell
student. called a Mexican Bottle
dance. This involves dancing over a
Tequila bottle until mostof the people
fall down. In its truest form, I'm sure
the Winner was entitled to a generous
swigofthedrink (orevcn thebottle?),
butfar be it for me to dictate how the
Folkdanccrs should dance.

being devilishly suspenseful, is also a subtle but respectful tribute to Alfred Hitchcock and the ntovtes for
which he was famous. This is a movie not to be missed. The cinematography is especially magical and

West Side Story IS the granduddy of the troubled teen gang films. Although afar cry from Colors or BoysN

Gray Panthers to appear in Arena

 

By Erin Lynch

To her collection of ten in me
plays entitled Gray Panthers: The
Dccatel, author J. E. Franklin added
this note: “Gray Panther: is the umr
brclla title for a body ol‘TenrMinute
plays focusing on the Black Elder as
the central character, in an effort to
codify some oftheruling moral prin-
ciples stockpile/d within the Black
value system, and the uses to which
they are put in resolving conflicts of
a moral nature."

Originally a decatct (group of ten
small plays), Gray Panther: will be
Composed of six plays, each smged
by director James Lincoln and stage
managed by Katherine Ames.
Franklin’s description of her work
proves itself accurate within the

course of herplays. While they touch

upon a vast range of issues, cach
explores moral qumtions faced not
only by the elderly, but indeed by
members of every race and genera-
tion.

In “Hot Melhusclah," Alice (pore
Lraycd by Adrienc McAdory) argues
with her son Charles (Ben Wallace)
over whether or not she should leave
her old husband whom she has seen
with another woman. In “Putting
Pippy Away." Emma (Maria-Louise
McCarthy) convinces hcr elderly
mother Ethyl (Andrea l-Ioeschen) to
institutionalize her mentally retarded
brother Pippy (Jesse Kano). In
"Solomon’s Way,” Anna(Lisa Dorn)
and Emile (Chip Brown) argue about
whether or not they should welcome
Emile‘s mother into their lives after
she abandoned him 65 years ago.
More than simply dealing with

moral struggles, Franklin's plays ex-
plore the communication gaps inher~
cntin families,marriagesandfriend
ships. Says Lincoln, “This is a pro»
duction aboutthepain ofloving some-
one." Each play portrays pcople in
conflictwitheach otherwhostrugglc
to overcome bitterness and reach a
lcvcl of mutual understanding.

Other cast mcmbcrs include
Wendell Pierson, S. Michael Smith,
Andre Fresco, Erin Lynch, Nathan
Brant,NicoleWesleyandKristylohn-
son. The set will be designed by Pip
Gordon.

Gray Panthers will run from Feb-
ruary 20 through February 23 in
Flanagan Arena Theatre. All perforr
mances will begin at 8:00 pm, ex-
cept Saturday's which will be a 2:00
pm matinee. Tickets will be avail-
able in the Forum.
