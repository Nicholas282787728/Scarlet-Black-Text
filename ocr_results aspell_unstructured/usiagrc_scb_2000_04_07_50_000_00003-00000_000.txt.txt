Last Monday, 16 students at the Univer—
sity orlowa in lowa City, member orstu-
dents Against Sweatshops (SAS), took over
jessup Hall and held a sir-in outside the of-
ﬁce ofPresident Mary sue Coleman,

They were determined not to leave until
three demands were met: the University join
theWorkerRighlsConsottium (WRC), pull
out ofthc Fair storAssoelarlon (FLA), and
develop a strong code orconduct for U1 ape
parel manufacturers.

According to their respective websites, 35
schools have joined theWRC, while 134 col-
leges and universities have aﬂiliated with the
FLA. SAS believes that the WC is the only
“independent organization that can uphold
the UI’s principles [and] not the greedy dic»
rates or inhumane corporations." Monday
evening, campus security repeatedly threat.
sntd arrests and ﬁnally merely dragged the
protesters, some oiwhom were chained lo-
gether, away from the omce out into the hallt
way.

The group continued to occupy the
building until press time, Tuesday night,
when they were again ready to sleep in Jessup
Hall, which was transformed by rents, activ-
ist debris, and propaganda on the walls A
march and rally against sweatshops were held
Tuesday afternoon. The activists marched to
President Coleman's house, and then to the
rally outside Jessup Hall.

The University has signed on to the
WRC, but SAS members are still waiting for
other demands to be met. In a statement on
the UI web page, President Coleman says,
“Although i, too, have been disappointed
with the FLA‘s slow pace or implementing
its code ofconduct and have some concerns
about its structure, I have decided that, in
view orits potential to bring about change,

the University should, at present, continue
our afﬁliation with the FLA, pending rur—
ther review or this organisation’s effective-
ness."

students, more seasoned activists, and
curious passersby were wellrtepresented at
the rally. There was a strikingly dressed pets
formance artist working at a sewing machine.
A large drum accentuated chants such as,
“Mary sue [Coleman] and Kathie Lee:
they're the same iryou ask mel" Signs plot
claimed, “Fight tor a U1 that puts people
first," “Mary Sue: get a spine and take a
standl" and “Dr. King is with us," The rally
was also commemorating the assassination
orDr. Martin Luther King on Apr. 4.

Four students at the periphery orthe rally
called themselves studeno Against the Meth.
ods or students Against sweatshops
(SAMSAS). They wanted a stop to the
“squabble,” Sll-lns, and harassment ofPtesl-
dent Coleman, and accused the students
Against sweatshops ora mob mentality. They
believe UI should beapart orboth rheWRC
and the FLA, taking advantage orthe FLA’s
money and corporate backing. FLA oppoe
nents countered that joining the FLA legiti-
mizes it and that it is not compatible with
the wnc.

Joe 0bryckt, who spoke {or SAMSAS,
said he hadspent six hoursstudying the FLA
and WRC, but another woman pointed out
that children in many countries Work much
more than six hours a day. Another SAMSAS
member stated mat the us had once had

and should not have to spend money helps
ing other countries make the same move,
