ner. We admired the bright lights and
raucous calls or the vendors and shop
owners tryiing to lure pedestrians.

The buildings were decked out (or
Christmas, so the View from the top of the
building we ate in was great. Kozo had to
translate the brightly lit signs because
they were in the Kanji dialect. which i can
not read.

After dinner. we hEaded towards
Kabuklcho. the drinking and dz‘ncing area
D! Shinjuku. Sushi bars, ramen btures, and
drinking shops abounded, but we decided
on seeing TOP GUN because the discos are
prohibitively expensive during the

holidays. The night ended in a Shinjuku
ban as we drank Sapporo Beer and muns
ched on yakitorl (octopus hors d'oeuvres)
and dried lish.

We parted at 11:00 in the Shinjuku sta-
tion because it takes Kozo onerandahalf
hours by train to get home, Kozo seemed
pleased when I told him it was one of the
best Christmases I’d had.

We managed to overcome the various
problems most iirst dates present, plus a
iew unexpected ones. Since then, we‘ve
gone to the Tokyo Hard Rock Gale and
gone lcerskating and sight-seeing. With my
Englishuapanese dictionary to accom»
pany Kozo’s iapaneseEnglish one. my
dates with Kozo have been great.

There are the musical parallels to other
rap groups. Hey, rap is rap. There is the
heavy, driving beat oi the drum tracks and
the obligatory scratching and sonic bursts.
The most obvious ripoii is the use oi well
known heavy-metal guitar licks in their
cuts. “She's Cralty” uses a Jimmy Page-

Unfortunately. the results of the away
game against Coe on January 27 were not
as good. Grinnell lost, 4973, and both
Coach Fairchild and Eastman cited
reasons [or the loss. ”Coe shoots very well
from the outside. and we didn't, and
though we were within six points at the
half. we couldn't seem to put the ball in the
bucket in the second half," Fairchild com-
menled.

"We didn’t work our offense at all; we
tried to lorce the ball and our shooting was
pretty bad." Eastman admitted.

However. the women have two away
games to which to look forward this
weekend; they play Knox today and Mona
mouth on SaturdayuBoth are conierence
games, and the team hopes to win them

both “The Coe coach told us we should be
able to beat both teams, We want to at
least tie for conference," Eastman said.

Darby again. the home court seems to
spark the team to play better. The
Pioneers will cover both ends oi the spec-
trum this weekend, as they play struggling
Lake Forest (sinless) and undeieated
University oi Chicago. The coach is hoping
that playing at home will pull his team out
oi their lagging slump To do so, it would
be helpiui to have some ian support- no.
not a cheap plug for the team. They really
need the support, and a packed Darby
could put them over the hump.

By no means are the Pioneers going to
hang up their jerseys and call it a iorgotten
season They have demonstrated great im
provement and their remains the strong
possibility that they will “make a season oi
it." and achieve Smith's goal oi iinishing
in the top hali oi the Southern Division, ”In

it's our turn." Let's all hope so.

overall GPA of students will not change
much it we incorporate pluses and
minuses. Those who would have gotten a
3 5 Ar under the present system will now
get. either 3,67 Ar, or 3 33 8+ grades. Some
who may have gotten 3.0 B grades may get
3.33 3+ grades. The overall eliect, if you
add them together and divide, is minimal.
A study done by the University of Chicago
substantiates this claim, The University
recently changed its system in a way
analogous to what has been proposed at
Grinnell, and found no substantial dil'r
Ierence in student GPAs. In my mind,
however, the most conclusive evidence ol
the non-aﬂect oi the proposed changes on
GPA. however, came from the Curriculum
Committee. There, one proiessor claimed
the new system would inflate grades, and
one claimed it would deﬂate grades,
Usually. when members of Grinnell laculr
ty committees disagree, nothing happens.
With regard to GPA, this rule of thumb is
no exception.

The concern over the law school applica-
tions stems from a widespread beliel that
Grlnnell's system, weird though it may he,
helps Grinnell students in their graduate
schoor applications, The theory goes that
grad schools ignore plus and minus
grades, and look at the letter that precedes
the plus or minus. So, a student who has
really done B+ work but gets a as A at
Grinnell, would be viewed as having
received an A in a graduate school, which
would benefit the student. Addition of a
3+. goes the argument, would reduce the
rreouency oi A-, and not help those getting

3+ grades, Since they would be rounded
down. This is a major area of concern, and
so. over Christmas break. I sent out iorty-
seven letters to graduate schools (all of
which. by the way. brandishcd our hip new
logo) ranging from Harvard Business
School to the University oi Hong Kong, in
which I asked about their methods at
evaluating Grinnell transcripts, of the
twenty [our schools that have responded,
twenty one said that the effect on their in-
terpretation or our GPA would be negligi~
ble. and that in any event, the quality of
the undergraduate institution, the classes
taken, the scores received on standardized
tests, letters of recommendation, and
class rank were at least as important as
GPA. The other three said they do ignore
pluses and minuses when_evaluating an
undergraduate GPA. but even they said
that the grade point average is just one oi
many iactors taken into account when com
sidering applicants ior admission,

It appears, then, that the success at
Grinnell students in their post-Grinnell life
will not be substantially altered with the
new grade system. While at Grinnell.
however. the proposed changes will have a
benelicial impact on students. in reducing
confusion about the meaning of a grade,
and more accurately reﬂecting student
periormance And iinally. though I am less
certain of the ellect the change will have
on your mom, my mom loves the idea.
Consequently, l urge that the iaculty ap-
prove the proposed grade system as soon
as possxble.
