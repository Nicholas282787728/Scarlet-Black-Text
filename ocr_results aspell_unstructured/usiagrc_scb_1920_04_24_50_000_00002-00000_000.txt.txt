111E lliL-llo SD COLLEGE MAN
_' (FY0111 the Dherlin Review)

It is oi no little interest to look over
an assembly composed or college men.
The gathering usually includes men
or many types, among them the shell»
rimmed spectacled grind, the prude,
the self-conﬁdent popula ty seeker,
the dapper chaser, thc o‘rawny athlete,
the poor soul with his eye so ﬁrmly
ﬁxed upon his star thz'tt he does not
see the ground upon which he treads,
the love—sick swniu "sighing like a
furnace," and the misguided youth
who endeavors to bring his high
school ways with him to college.
These are only a low or the ones
ones sees all ‘too many of in
the average college group. But
we are interested not‘ it. the
sports, whose lives instead oi being
well—rounded out are triangular or per
tagou in shape but rather in the

cause the all—around college type
should take part in the outside activi-
ties ,ol his school. Secondly we would
notvae him a philistinehut a reli—
gious creed oi some sort would he ne—
cessary to completely round out his
character. 'Besides we should ask
that he make for hiinseli a moral code
and live up. to it rigorously. 1n the
third place the ideal college man must

in good condition. it he is interested

As tor the less serious sidc oi the
