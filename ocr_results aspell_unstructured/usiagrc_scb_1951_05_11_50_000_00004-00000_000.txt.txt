for mailing selective service
college qualification test applle
cation cards. All post card ap—
plications for the test must _be
postmarked not later than mid

ed out.

The deadline is to allow time
to the administrators of the

assign each applicant to one of
the 1200 testing centers, and

designate a date on which the ,

applicant is to report to take
the test.
Four Tests Given

The three testing dates are
May 26, June 16, and June 30.
All three dates are on Saturday.
A fourth examination will be
held on Thursday, July 12. This
examination is fur students
whose religious beliefs are such
that they can not take the ex-
amination on a Saturday. Col.
onel Lancaster said that these
students, like the others, must
mail their applications not later
than midnight, May 15.

The tests will be given at
Grinnell all four dates in Darby
gym at 8:30 am. Students must
bring their admission cards and
should bring either a pen or a
pencil. t

Scores to be Used

Scores of the Selective Ser-
vice college qualification test
will be used by local draft
boards in considering student
deferments. Application blanks
may be obtained from the near—
est draft board; students do not
have to return home to the 10-
cal board which has jurisdiction
over them. ,

To be eligible to take the sea
lective service college qualificae

request occupational deferment
as a student, <2) must be under

his college or university studies
(the applicant need not be in a
four year college but his entire

transfer of credits to a degreel
granting institution.)

The test will be given by the
educational testing service at no
cost to the applicant. The regi5r
trant will be required to pay

Men has asked all students who
wish to apply for student em-
ployment next year to do so

1(Sleds Purchase
lMovie Equipment
For Next Semesi'er

“Movies are better than cVer,“
This statement is more fact than
fiction now that Gadabouts have
bought $100 worth of new
equipment for the Student body,

The equipment includes two
loud speakers which will imv
prove the sound. An amplifier
which makes the sound travel
to the speaker with greater efe
ticieney was also obtained. The
most expensive item was a spec—
ial coated lens which cuts the
ilm to the size of the small
screen.

In order to eliminate the ire»
quent interruptions when the
reel runs out, a new machine
plus a changeover unit will be
needed, Plans to purchase these
are in progress for next year.

Another plan for next semes—
ter is to book better films
through a new company. The
absence of one of the reels im-
paired the showing of “sitting
Pretty." This was because the
movie company sent a poor box
for the reel and before the reel
could be put on the machine, it
fell out and became entangled
with tables, operators, and ma-
chines,

iFrosh Relay Team
Wins Race, Trophy

ny Mack Wright

If you should happen to wane
dcr into the coaches’ office in
Darby, you would probably be
immediately aware of three new
'lglenmings in the room. i

The first is the beautiful first
place trophy gaincd at the Bee
loit Relays last weekend by the
freshman Sprint medley relay
team, The other two gleamings
are the eyes of freshman track
‘coach. Wayne Cooley. And well
lmlgl‘lt he be proud of the show-
ing of his boys.

Let’s start by analyzing the
quartet of participants Jim
Klein. the decathloii man from
Glendale, Calif., led off with a
52:5 quarter. Then came Don
Hager and Dick Johnson, each
running a 220 leg. And finally,
there was anchor man Lin
Stacey with the half mile ti e
of 2:033. All four were parti
pants in other freshman sports
before track season,

The team posted their victory
over various freshman squads
including representatives from
most of the conference schools.
lLast year, Grinnell had to be

Here comes the cappcr. The
freshmen also entered in the
distance medlcy, and were a
good 50 yards in first until the
anchor milc started. They haul»
ed in a fifth in this highly di—
versified event.

What does Coach Cooley have
to say about all of this? Very
modestly he states that there is
“quite a future for Grinnell
through the freshmen now out
for track. We are not deep in
personnel, but certainly have
excellent men in some events."
