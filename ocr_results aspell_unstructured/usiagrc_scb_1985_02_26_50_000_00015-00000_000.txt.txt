The importance of Being Earnest (1952!
is a British film adapted from the Oscar
Wilde play of the same name.

Michael Redgrave and Michael Denison
star as two wealthy bachelors who have
problems dealing with their marital pro
spects. The film lacks the charm oi the
play because the director mixed two
styles. 'rhe’ movie was iilmed in part as an
adaptation ol the play. and also as a lilmed
version oi the stage production. Despite.
the directional problems. the film‘s
leading men and an amusing plot make
The Importance oi Being Earnest a fairly
.0041 film. .

munist states in loveless marriages, ex-
cept in Romania. The Roman Orthodox
Church is still seen as an important aspect
oi Romania's cultural heritage and ethnic
identity. The Orthodox liturgy is one of the
oldest in Christendom, and the spirituality
oi the service is intensified by the splen-

ty of some oi the most inspiring choral
