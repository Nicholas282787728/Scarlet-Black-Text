Senatorial Elections
Slated ‘

‘ Voting Rules Changed

by Laurie Dunivant

In the past, choosing one’s represen-
tatives to the Student Government has re-
quired about as much thought as choosing
an entree at the dining hall: you go there,
they throw a few options in your face, and
you grab whatever looks best, This
semester, the Election Board has
developed a new procedure for senatorial
elections that will hopelully bring more
significance and validity to the election
process:

Now. each candidate will be required to
Submit a statement of intent to run. prior
to election day. that explains his/her
reasons ror running. and outlines her/his
qualifications (or the position. All can
didate statements Will be posted lmr
mediately in their respective dorms or
houses ior public viewmg Not only will
this force those running to think caretully
about their candidacy, but it will also allow
the Voters to know and consider their op-
tions prior to election night.
