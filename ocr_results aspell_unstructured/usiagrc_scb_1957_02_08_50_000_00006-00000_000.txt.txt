Cont. from p. 2

Living with a group of woe
men day after day most of
whom think, act, and live in the
same way as oneself can become
pretty monotonous in time. A
casual date now and then keeps
us from stagnating. The social

program on this campus cer-
tainly provides ample opportun-
ity for such dates.

We reailize that there are
many other factors in this prob.
lem but we do want to make
this point clear.

Most sincerely,
A Group of Cleveland Freshmen
