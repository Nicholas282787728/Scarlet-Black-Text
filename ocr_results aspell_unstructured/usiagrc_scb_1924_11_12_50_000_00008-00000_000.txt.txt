year he starred at left halfback until
he was injured in the Washington
game, and had to be out tor the rest
of the season, and this year be
back at the same position and doing
nicely, although he has been some-
what handicapped by injuries. His
punt—lug ability has always been one of
his strongest points, for he has the
uncanny ability of placing his kicks
wherever he wants to; he demonstrate

ed this ability very well in the Wash‘

ingwn game this year when twice in
succession he punted out of bounds on
the. two-yard line.

.seasons. In high school he was an

lcoaches needed a center, “Pete"iilled
the bill. and has been keeping up the

Greenfield.

Evan Jones, Qilllrtei-ltnck

I “Cappy” is one of the few who make
good on the gridiron despite lack of
size. Last year when Grinnell was
sadly in need of a quarter, Cappy came
through, and proved that “the bigger

one oi the best interference runners
on the squad, is a good field general.
and can pack the ball with the best of
them. He is from Cresco, Iowa.

and has proven a valuable addition to
“Mike" Hyland’s aggregation. He

has been e valuable asset. He was Ln—
