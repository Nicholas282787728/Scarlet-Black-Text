the call of Mike Hyland, spring root-

and style of playing.

The plans at the coach. are not yet
deﬁnite, but he expects to divide the
time between the linemen and back-
held candidates.

The emphasis oi the spring work
will be placed upon footwork and fun-
damentals or the game and there will
he no tackling or blocking.

Despite track, which is taking a
good many football men's time, there
was a splendid array of material out
to meet Hyland. Among the letter
men were Sweet, Clarke Kingery and
”Capﬂy" Jones in the backﬁeld and
Meyer and Cathcart in the line. The
new men included in their ranks,
Moran, Archie Johnson, Niblo and
Hays, all stars on the freshman squad
