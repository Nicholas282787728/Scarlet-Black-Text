people know and love. While I‘m not

check out this cultural phe-

Bradley: There was a
time, probably in be.
tween junior high and
high school, when every '
one saw rhrs movie, un
video or in theatres. Sonic»

The Fast Runner (R)

J: Perhaps the biggest mistake the
films committee made this semester
was [0 schedule one of the best movies

oflastyear on Disco night,

especially when that movie

runs n=lrr1y three hours.

Regardless, the ﬁlm is

brilliant.Thcsroiyfol.

lorvs a group of nor

madic lnurt hunters in a cold, baircn land long ago. ln the

beginning, an evil spirit is mlsed, throwing the tribe into

growing turmoil throughout the movie. There are personal

conﬂicts and hatred leading to An act or vengeance and

Aritnnariuat (translated The Fast Runner) running for hrs

lifc across dre frozen landscape. Aritririariuat survives and
the evil spirits, in the end, are conquered.

B: sigh, again, a ﬁlm I haven’t seen. Tlrrs film's distrlr

biition was incredibly small, However. rfyou’ll recall the

Top to FilmsLisrs (8ch Vol 19, Num. ls,lrn. 31), my

mother named The Fast/(runner thcs'mdr best ﬁlm of

2002. Sixth! And that's coming from

a very reputable cinema source.

1: Tire Flu: lerln' is an epic

ﬁlm and story, highly complex in

a simple frame. The setting in the

Arctic plays a huge role; the

sound otcruirching snow land

in; almost the entire

Soundlmck. The filiirmriki rig is

so spare and straightforward

than the audience can Fcel the

snow and the cold. True. the

movit: is long and some might ar.

gue slow moving, but I didn’t ﬁnd

either a problem. The story has such

Brad's Last Gasp: I love my mom, so I’ll watch this
movie.

Jeremys FinalWord: Beautiful, original, honest, breath
taking. and easily one of the best ﬁlms l've seen in past
years

The Breakfast Club (R)

B: Finally a movie l've seen! This film, which any 1c-
gitimate Em of 1980s American pop culture has memo.
rrzcd, follows one day of Saturday detention for ﬁve stu—
dents in Sliermer, “L: a lock (Emilio Esrevcz), a geek (An-
thony Michael Hall), a popular girl (Molly Ringwald), a
recluse (Ally Sheedy), and, well, Bender (Judd Nelson).
These smmoq’pical kids, all being watched by a hard-ass
principal (Paul Gleason), ovcrlook their status drffcrcnces
and forge, well, a club.

A brilliant high school comedy, Tirr Breakfast C/rrlrwas
the peak of the careers of all the actors involved, as well as
writer/director John Hughes. While I mn’t guarantee that
you'll enjoy any or the other movies this weekend. I can
assure you that you can't go wrong with this or any movie
sct in Shermer, 111..

J: Nope, haven't seen this one. Nopc, don't really rvaiit
to.

B: Forshamcl

Rashomon (NR)

J: Akrm Kurosawa was one of the greatest ﬁlmmakers
of all time and [lax/10mm) still stands as one of hrs best.
Featuring Tosliiro Mirune, Kurosawa's favorite actor, the
ﬁlm dispenses with traditional straight narrative fora multr
layered philosophical meditation. A murder has occurred
in the woods and every witness tells a radically diirererit
story. The question is not “Who's right?" but “Om any of
these people be right?" A brilliant ﬁlm and a perfect set up
for heated conversation afterward.

things into the categories of"]ewish” and “Goyish”. For

all three. The book has the potential to be maudlin and
whiny irwe paid attention to the plot alone. Ralhtr, the
narrative drives the book, as even the seriotu conversations
have a “pingpong” sorr ofrhythm.

Smith's also hip because she’s all “postcolonial.” Her
