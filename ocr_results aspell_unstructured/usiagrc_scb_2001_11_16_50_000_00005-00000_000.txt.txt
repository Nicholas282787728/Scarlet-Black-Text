Nor only does rho play deal wirh issues oiraee. arr. and

The Director

Pip Gordon. chair of rhc 'l’hearre deparrmcnr, said.
“There was a loi olinrerusr. nor only among rhearre Stu»

Gordon said “Raandra’s resume is very, verysrrong," Along

rhar was jusr it." In rerenrycars his lisr ofawarili has grown
vcry long. Gordon said “I have no doiibr in ﬁve years rinne
we will be seeing him cross rhe srage for his‘l'ony award."
For his parr, Maharai said “Pip Gordon...recruircd really
hard for me ro come here...l knov eveniually [chloral]

Ancestral iiilluenre plays a large pair in Maharais ar.

slaves and kings. and noihing can break my spiiir," He
explains his inrcrprcraiion of Cnbrtlrl largely in rhose rerms

up rrom hrs chinrwith asqueakand ran across rhe srage ro
ihe large revolving door. Built large enough ro accommo»
dare sci changes, Maharai saw soinerhing else. Pasring his
back liar, he spun rhc door madly around and around,
siopped, and grinned. Then bask in his crcaky woodcn

Members olrhe audience. especially rhose hmiliai-wirh
rhe rear of Calm, will have ample opporniniry ro appre—
ciarc ihe formidable arrisric power Mahara, has exercised
on rhe play. The acr ofinrcrprcrarion is whar makes (h:-

EmilyAioriu '02 sald: “The iexr as ii srands is loss inreresi.

From whar has hccome ihe de lacro srandard produciion
include usubrle roman iic inreresr benveen Einsr and Cliff,
a blaeklsec spin on “Mon could see Her rhiough My

more dissonanr. The sum clrecr is an inrorprerurion which

The norion ora musical ar Grinnell is an inieroring
one, as is is nor rhe sorrorairisricwork ro which liberal airs
srudenrs and insririirions normally gravirarc, According ro
Maharai, “One oirhe rrue American arr forms is rheArneria
can musical." The balance henveen rhc meaning inherenr
in ihc dramarie seenos and rhc mcaning inhereni in rhe
meranarrarive rhar is rhe musical numbers in any musical
is a delicare and dynamic one. When Pip Gordon, who as
Frauleln schniedcr is raking hcr hrsr aering role, breaks
inro srilred, somewhar awkward song in “so What,” one
rannor help bur be reminded rhar rhc esseniial idiom of
rhe musical is rhar ofcarncst meaning and omoiiori.

Mahaiaj, "There’s a Ior ofgrear sruifdiar's happening rhar's
