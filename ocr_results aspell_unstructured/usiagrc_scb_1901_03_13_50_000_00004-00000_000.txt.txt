‘Work in thc Cage was begun

gross being made. About
thirty candidatcs havc iepolted

is

and have been assigned periods in
which to work. They are taking
hold with lots of ginger and with
the characteristic Gl‘iilnell spirit
which means so much to the sllcs
cess of an athletic team.

There is a bcttcr opportunity
for the new men than there has
been in years. As thcrc arc prac-
tically no “sure positions" the

competition for places is sure to'

be spirited and productive of ex-
celleiit results.

While the work now being done
is of such a nature as to prevent
“getting a line" on the men and
wlirle it is too early to make
predictions as to tlle quality ot
the team whrch is to' represent
Glinnellon the diamond this ycar.
yet great encouragement is seen
in the spirit shown by tliosc now

nal sources and the working
knowledge thusgained is not only
valuable but of practical utility.
A fair idea at the nature of the
critical work may be gained from
an articlc on the authenticity of a
volume of alleged [Wm/win which
appeared in the last Unit. The
members of the class are nolv en-
gaged in working up topics on
the early history of Iowa. It isto
be regretted that more students
are not sufﬁciently advanced to
be able to avail themselves of this
course. and it is to be hoped that
some arrangements can be made
to meet the growing demand tor
research library work.
