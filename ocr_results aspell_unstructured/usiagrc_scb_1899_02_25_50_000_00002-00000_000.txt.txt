WHILE THE efforts of our repre~
sentative were not rewarded by
iirst place in Thursday evening's
oratorical contest, at Mt. Vernon,
still we feel that he has acquitted
himself with credit. We cannot
always be victorious; all we ask is
thatour representativesin any can
test shall do their best, and this
Mr. Risser has certainly done. As
long as there is no opportunity
here tor training in oratory and
elocution we cannot expect our
representatives to compete on
equal terms with those who have
superior advantages in these lines.

THE LECTURES of Mr. J.. W.
Martin given iri the college chapel
every eveningthis week have been
well attended by the students as

well as by some of the townspeo-‘

ple. These addresses have been
very instructive and highly en~
joyed by all. Mr. Martinis a re-
former of the best type, a clear.
interesting and convincing speak-
er, and deals with topics at the
greatest interest. The fact that
he is an Englishman and active in
English and London politics gives
to his words on municipal governs
ment and expansion a peculiar
value, and it is most fortunate
that we have been able to hear
him, The only regret is that we
cannot. hear such men more fre-
quently.

A Communication,

EDITORS SCARLET AND BLACK:7
A few comments on the Orator-
ical Contest. and the part that the
representative of Iowa College
took in that contest lvill not be
amissat this time. iowa College
has learned that “a football player
does not spring up like a mush.
roominthenight.” ltapparently
has yet to recognize the same
truth with regard to an orator or
a debater. The gentleman win
ning ﬁrst place in the contest had
the advantage of two days' traili-
ing tor lhisspccial occasion under
Mr. Cunlnock, of Northwestern
University. Last year he spent a
longer time under this same in-

structor in preparation for the ’98
contest. While Iowa College’s
representative was unable to se-
cure any such special training, his
delivery demonstrated most ems
phatically that with more training
he would have received a much
higher rank than that. accorded
him by the judges. This state
ment is similar to what has fies
quentlyappeared iliyourcolunlns,
but it is as true today as ever, that
if Iowa College is to maintain the
position it should hold in the Col-
legiate Oraloi-ical Association, the
students must lend better support
to their representatives, and there
must be some regular instructor
in oratory and eiocution in the
college laculty.

A glance ahead at the Cornell
debltte. Two of Cornell's debaters
have spent a week in special study
on the subject in Chicagb. The
college is planning to have a Spa
cial train down to Grinncll for the
debate, and it is to be sincerely
hoped that the visitors will not
outnumber the representatives of
the homcinstitution,asthcy might

ence in attendance than they did
at a similar occasion two years
ago. Iowa College Dives it to her
debaters and to herself to see that
there is a full house on that occa-
sion, and if, asthey certainly will,
