Putting together the

Battle of Mac Field

, It was the quintessential ending to what could be-
come one of the most memorable Titular Head movies
of all time. Alex Reich ’11 halved Kyle LyneHKlnrup
‘10 to end their lightsaher duel and prepared to take
on an AT AT and an onslaught of storm troopers in
an epic Mac Field showdown Suddenly, the camera
panned hack to the dining hall to ﬁnd a Sith Lord.
the Emperor” .Dining Supervisor, Lyle Buuman

The scene was a composite of about 20 layers of
material brought together using After Effects, Adobes
post production video and visual effects editing tool,
along with about three to four hours of intensive editing
by director Henry Reich 09. Each individual shot was
taken using a ﬁxed tripod, giving Reich a static image
and allowing him to place' images where they needed to
be without altering the background

The original shot finds Alex Reich, ligbrsaber ready,
staring across’ an empty Mac Field. Not much there.

‘ Then Reich adds the AT AT.

“1 had already ﬁgured out the AT- AT for my prior .
shot [crushing bounty hunter and campus bike rider
Dan Krauss ’12], had animated it walking and at it V
textured,” Henry Reich said. The AT AT model, like i

, the Millenniu Falcon and the X Wing, is available
free online. Reich Just had to make it move ~
, Next came the 11 stormtroopers, all played by
Charles Packard, a local resident who yusr happened to
have a costume. Each stormtrooper was Packard, shot *
. separately and then brought together in the editing
process. ,
Add in blasters and explosions, and finally, the cam—
era zooms back to Lyle.
‘ Wewent into the dining hall with a camera on our
shoulder, Henry Reich said The people sitting wirh
him were like its that time of the year, Lyle. we ust
told him that we’ re making the movie and he’ s the m-
peter and sllwe needed him to do was turn around and
‘ do the lightning move. _ ,
, ‘_ The original shot has Lyle, but eliminates the back- ‘
3 ground, replacing' it with the layers that Reich had made
5 for rhe ﬁnalﬁgh't scen‘e. With the pieces in place, (he ,

1 The most u'mc'oonsuming scenes to crane featured many of
dueleast noﬁneablespe cial eﬂ‘ects

Take the movie’s eyecatehnrg yet relatively brieﬁ opening scene,
where Alex Reich’s ’11 X Wing was atmckcd by a TIE Fighter and
cmhslanded on the Grinnell campus.

“For this one I had an X- -Wing model downloaded ﬁom the' ins
temet and I had to render' it and animate it ﬂying downwards with
parades coming out of the engine, ".l-l Reier said "And rhar gets
composired onro dais layer [with the satellite] This is a simple shot
once you have IheX- -Wing ui it, its just the badground layer and the
x- -Wing. Then Reich usr had to animate rhe map, manipulating
a still aerial image from the us. Geological survey to make the X
Wing looklike it acnnlly crashed in Ganndl. ltwas aoneperson job.

Meanwhile, the lighlsaber duels between A Reich and Kyle
Lynchal<lnnrp '10 took multiple tech members and counrless hours
ofwork to ﬁnish

“Most ofdic people involved [with the movie] were just drawing
l.i ghlsabers," H. Reich sud.

First, A. Reich and Lyn ch Klarup ﬁlmed their ﬁght scenes us
ing removable PVC pipe blynades, giving the Lightsnher eﬁ’ecm team a
reference point. The crew then had rd roroscopc rhe lightsahers into
rhe ﬁnal product, tracing ﬁameahy-hamc where rhe lightsaber eltects
should go in each shot

The lightsabers arc iusr square bores [drawn around rlrc PVC

pipes] rhar you move around where the lighnaber should be crew-
member Anders Ahlherg 10 said. Youre ,ust masking it out and tell—
ing [the computer] where' it is."

At 30 Emma: per second and with lighlsabers appearing in more
man two minutes of the movie, (he bigglst eﬁeets scenes ﬁnished long
before the lightsaber duels, making rhe ﬁnal editing process uleimarely
revolving around a criu'ml mass ofroloscoping.

Thursday night beforeTitular Head, six (2qu were in [the CCL]
all going crazy,"H Reich said.

But Alilberg noted are least remarkable spoo'al eEects scenes are

often what make the movie work

‘With a lot deﬂects, the goal is to be hidden,”Ahlberg said ”The
ultimate goal is for rhe audience to not think ofit as an eﬂrect, but part
ofthe movie."

ﬁlm noravision for howcenain scenes would be shot.

Had “StarWars Grinnell"tumed out differently, H. Reich said we
could have seen the original plans ofa lighlsaber duel on top ofa moi/r
ing brain or a dmrnabc jump oELhe moromoyoe. in fact, the iniu‘al
lwo-nnd-arhi y shoot produced a ﬁlm that would have ended in
de and didn't include many of the movies key climactic scenes,
which came later during a brainstorming session.

“We had this idea that we wanted to have [A Reich and Lyndn-
Klnrup] come onto Mac Fldd and we wanted the shot of Lyle after
Alex killed Kyle,"H Reich said. “So all we knewis that we needed to
have that shot at the end."

Even when rhey had tentative plans, they found it more producnve
to just ﬁlm and see what happened.

“The lightsaher ﬁght in Quad basementwasdt originallyplanned,"
H. Reich said. “When we got mere we said we needed a couple of
shcm' in the kitchen beforehand. Then we went downstairs Just to
utplor: and saw this basement Lhatwas this trashed place and thought
OK,we need to ﬁght here. The vast ma joriry ofit we just had them
ﬁg ht each other. They’d do it for 3045 seconds and then take a break."

3. Most ofdie time, actors and animators had little idea how
dieirworkwould' integrate into die ﬂml pmdlch

H. Reich decided that the most efﬁcient way to make the movie
would involve keeping mosr ofthe people involved in the dark

“You’d rather be shooting rhan orphmmg what point in rhe srory
they're at," H. Reich said. “People were good abour tmsling exacdy
what we were doing."

For LyncleKlarup, this meant accepting an invitation based on his
sword ﬁghting skills and his willingness to jump otra bridge, wear a
suh costume and follow along.

"I had no idea whatl was being a sub Lord torrLyndialaanip
said.

The animators faced a similarly slow and veiled process.

“You’d be seeing pans orrhe movie where the ellrects wererlr done,
a scene of [Dan] Krauss £12] riding his bike on the loggia ”Ahlbtrg
said. “Then allofa sudden, you do sometlung, and he gets stepped on.
Its tool to see it evolve, die shots you’re working on going ﬁorn one
stormuooper to 16. "

But the most slarded onlookers might have been those who knew
nothing ofTitular Hmd.

"We were shooting the scenes whereI killed Kyle on a big prospie
weekend, " A. Reich said So rhere were 200 people walking across
Mac Field and we were lherewilh lightnbers.
