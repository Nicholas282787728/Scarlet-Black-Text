Strong Performances Lead GERONIMO/ Skydiving Club has its

to Great Opportunities for
the Pioneer Track Team

GROUP of Grinnell track
A tnen have earned the right

to run at one of the most
prestigious track meets in the counr
try. The Pioneers will field as many as
four relay teams and one individual at
the Drake Relays this weekend.

“We have been solid in our rc-
lays and our Limes are good enough
for us to run at Drake. This is a great
opportunity for our athletes." com-
mented Coach Will Freeman. The
mentor hopes to have units entered in
the 4x100,4x400, sprintmedley and
distance medley relays, and Mike
Nawrocki in the Steeplechase.

Many of the top times for the
relays were set at the Grinnell/
DeLong Classic last Saturday. The
Pioneers won seven events, which is
outstandingconsideringtlteyhad only
placed ftrst three times the previous
three years at the Classic.

Freeman singled out the win—
ning 4x100 and 4x400 relay runners
as the top performers. Brent Dexter,
Chad Folsom, Rob Yamachika, and
Darren Young posted a 42.54 in the
sprint relay and set a new Grinnell
record. The 4x400 unit of Folsom,
Young, Scott Newstrom, and Dexter
ran a 3:22.06.

Sprinters Dexterand Youngalso
had success individually. Young
grabbed the title in the 200M with a
time of 22.10. The win was the sec-
ond of his career, as he also won the

eventasa freshman. Dexter,a rookie,
posted his first time under 50 sec—
onds by running a 49.42 to win the
400M.

A solid distance crew has been
the trademark for Grinnell the past
few years, and the group this year is
no exception. Middleman Jon
Greenberg continued to run in top
forrn,easilywinning the 1500M with
a time of4:00.10. Nawrocki cruised
to victory in the steepleehase in
9:36.54, just nine seconds off na-
tional qualifying time. For the
second week in a row, Jeff Ulmer
was a titlist as he ran a 15:27.45
in the 5000M.

Peter Morrison, Mark Beilstein,
Barry Matchett and Greenberg also
placedthirdinthe4x800Mrelaywith
a time of 8:02.86. Jon Marciari and
Matchett also caught Freeman's at-
tention by finishing fourth and 5ch
enth in the 10,000M.

A trio ofpole vaulters gave solid
efforts by placing third. fifth and
eighth. Dan Brozoski leaped 14'0"
while Tom Nuzum went 13'6" and
Rick Wiederien reached 12'6".

“We were very happy with the
organization of the meet and how
smoothly it ran. The performances of
ourathletes were generally good. All
along we thought we had a good
outdoor team. Now we are seeing the
results of all the hard work," cone
eluded Freeman.

First Jump and (Hopefully) Landing

by J 1111 Kropa

OMORROW andSunday,the

I first of42 adventurous Grin-
nell sludcnls will hurl theme

selves atiowa from 3000 feetaboveit.

Thcjump is organized by Grin-
nell‘s brand new skydiving club,
founded by junior Mike Hanna and
sophomore Matt Haber.

”Our idea was basically ‘Power
in Numbers.m said Haber. On the
day offall registration, he and Hanna
got the idea of initiating a skydiving
club while Haber was working in the
water polo booth. 140 people signed
up the ftrstday. Today nearly 175 are

on the club's mailing list.

The power of numbers allowed
Hanna and Haber to negotiate a sig-
nificantly discounted price for the
firstjump. According to Haber, nor-
malprice fora firstjump isSlSO, but
one might expect to pay as little as
$1 10withstudentdiscountsandluck.

“Due to our large numbers and
heavy participation that we prom-
ised, we got the price down to $85,”
Haber said.

Haber credits Hanna for coordi-
mating with national skydivingorgani-
zations to assure safety and getthe best
possible deal. “A lot of the work was
done over spring break." Haber said.

Hanna decided to hire the Iowa

Skydiving Company ofOttumwa for
the club's ﬁrstjump. He also secured
the Grinnell airport and two fields
outside of Grinnell for tomorrow‘s
lake-off and landing.

Haber said that one of his goals
is to get more publicity for the club.
“Right now I’m trying to get pub-
lished in admissions brochures, and
so far admissions has been very cor
operative," Haber said. He believes
that knowing that skydiving is acces-
sible at Grinnell will attract prospecr
tive students.

In addition, a promotional sale

Haber said.
