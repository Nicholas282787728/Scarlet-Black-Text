New production challenges definition

nv BRIAN SHERWIN
When small children are brought to see a theatre produe
tron for the first time, they’re usually taught to try to understand
the story and watch the rtctols, not focus on the bright colors
ofthc costumes and set. In One Hundled Nights‘Dieams, the
show that new professor Cling qrinrero, Theatre, created and
directed, less attention on understanding and more on rmrner—
sion is actually encouraged
The production opened last night and will run until Sunday
at the Flanagan Theatre, and in all ways it will be both a rarity
and an oddity.
Devoid of traditional plot, characterization, and setting,
One Hundred Nighrs' Dreams favors a lyrical and surreal im-
agerbased approach. The srrhsrance of the play is developed in
“a series of images," Qiintero said,“oi a series of moments that
the audience can experience."
Chrintero had previously directed the play at the Taiwan
National Experimental Theatre and at the Avignon on FeSr
tival, but the Griunell College incarnation of One Hundred
Nights' Dreams will he very differ nt. “This piece,1'd say, is
about 90 percent different than the original version of 1000
Nights’ Dreams," ernrero said.
Despite its focus on the visuals, the performance does de-
pend on the actors for other aspects of its all-encompassing
vision of theatre. “If we tried to impose what we'd done be-
fore, then it [wouldn't] respond to the actor's bodies, the acror’s
voices, and personalities,"qrinrero said. '
Caitlin Davies '09, an actress in rhe play, hopes that the true
diencc will be open to this radically different style. “I hope they
wrll respond in a personalized way, have some patience and an
open mind to the type ofworlt that we've hcen doing and raise
wrrh them whar they will from rt," . . .
