it should be pointed out that
only two cottages, those with fresh-
man women, fell below the aver—
ages set by the best of the men‘s
halls.

Consultation with last year's re—
cord showed that the war may
have had a slightly lowering effect
on men's grades. Contrasted with
Rawson’s high or 2.042 is last
year's mark of 2.054, while the low
last year of 1.711 is not as far
down as Langan’s 1.574.

It associates were to be included
in the dormitory standings, Gates.
with 2,087, would be high.

In this year’s grade report. one
point was deducted for each hour
of NC. This is the first year such
a. method has been used it was
stated.

Drop Colorado Football Game

Colorado college, for the past four
years a highlight on the Grinnell
football schedule, has been drop-
ped according to the 1942 gi-ld
card as approved yesterday by the
faculty.

Explaining the move, G Lester
Duke, director of inter-collegiate
athletics, pointed out that the trip
is expensive for both institutions,
and because of the uncertain war
conditions, the school did not wish
to enter into a two-year contract
with the western college.

Also approved by the faculty
yesterday was the track schedule

which teatures nine meets. Open-
ing Feb. 25, with the A. A. U.
meet at Des Moines, the year's
program will include the Iowa
state relays, the Drake relays,
and the Midwest conference meet
at Des Moines.

The complete schedule is the
lightest in some years. Where in
the past it has been the custom
to play eight or nine games a
season. next year’s program has
been cut to six contests.

The complete schedules can be
found on page four.

Van Paassen 7
Sees Future

Peace Terms of I918
Guaran’reed Struggle
For World Domination

“We are watching today the cat-
astrophic arising oi a new order
founded on economic coordinatin
and a feeling of justice."

These are the words of Pierre
Van Paassen, noted foreign cor-
respondent and author who spoke
on “Democracy‘s Last stand" at
the high school auditorium last
night.

other highlights of the speech
were van Paassen’s emphasis on
Russia's part in the war, and the
fact that the Axis powers still
hold the upper hand.

“This war can have but two
results," he said. “There is go—
ing to be either a new world
with one race dominant or a new
economic order with consent of all
people. in whlch Europe will be-
come a single organism."

What Kind of a Fellow Is Van Paassen? -- Listen to Lurie’s Experience

is hard to believe that one man

By Howard Lurie

Pierre Van Padssen slept 11 of his
18 hours in Gl'lnnell yesterday, but
during the other seven he not only
waked up himself but aroused many
of his listeners — in their polltlcal
thought if not their physlcal state.

The famed journalist and commentator
on current events arnved in Gr-lnnell at
six 8, m. Monday. He spoke with no one
from the college until 1 called at_5:30
p. m. in his hotel mom during our Inter-
view at a p, m,, a rumpled bedshowed
conclusively mat he had slept since his
arrival.

The usual college inter-view questions—
“What do you think of the situation?”,
and “What will Russia do?”7wel'e no
limitation on Van Puassen's flow of i
formation. The man has an lulcanny ab
ity to put into a simple answer the op»
portumty for comment from related fields
to support all his contentions.

The man is a veritable stoma
house of experience and fact. He
has been everywhere, seen we're-
tlling and spoken to ”the” people of
the leading nations, His illustrations
were punctuated with, "When I was
traveling with Hitler," “Roosevelt

told me," “When the F. B. I. asked It

me,” and so on.

His winning personality and friendliness
which. frankly, I did not expect to find
in a man who boarded himself in his
room for twelve hours and refused to sce
the President of a college, a professor,
much less a student, convinced me that I
was enjoying a rare privilege.

A Burton l-lolmes travelogue could not
have been more educational. Mr. Van
Paasscn took me from Singapore to Mar-
seillcs; from London to Vienna; Contln»
cnts were spanned in minutesiaiways
with illuminating beacons of experienced
fact. '

could have been to so many places and
done so much in a lifetime. He told me
of his c 'perlellces with the Canadian army
in the first World War; his first job upon
return to this continent; the start of his
foreign corresponding; the wars he had
covered; the people he met,

1 had many questions to ask him about
the foreign situation which he did not,
and could not have spoken about in his
lecture. He had several fundamental be
licfs that he drove home to me in one
way or another in all his illustrations,
