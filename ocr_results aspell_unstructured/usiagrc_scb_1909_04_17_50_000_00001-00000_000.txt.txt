has come to be the musical and social
climax of the season, so did this pare

tatiou to sustain such as no previous
club had ever enjoyed. That it exceeds
ed tlle highest expectations. where not
to have more than made good would
have caused disuppointmeut. is praise
enough in itself.

It is impossible to mention here in
proper detail the features of the ever
ning's continuous enjoyment. From
the opening notes or “The Hunter’s
Song,” to the “annual blILHn oi the
has-beens," it was without a peer in
Glee Club annals. The familiar nunr
hers lost nothing on account oi their
tlrat the club
showed how and then a tendency to

familiarity excepting
rush songs which they have probably
sung to staleness in the past ieu
months. This was true oi Dudley
Smith's ”Archers hiarchillg Song," arid
most notably of the “Alumni Song."
A new song. “Flscatr.. by Horatio
Parker. contained good music and real
humor. it was admirably given and
as an eircore to it the club reached
the highest mark oi the evening im-
ﬁne slladings and absolute finish in the
familiar “Ask it You Damask Rose he
Sweet." by Handel.

Two love lyrics gave a ﬁne tolich oi
worth to the program and called tor
tvvo eooores. the tragic tale oi the wise
sage and his most elusive pigtall and a
selection devoted to the characteristics
or the eternal feminlhe.

Undoubtedly the most popular fea-
ture was the “Songs of the Southland"
which were given with a sincerity and
richness that renewed their hold on
the heart. The "Scottish National Au-
them" was a stirring novelty that was
given a spirited rendition. A new
medley built up on the loundations oi
the older ones was well received and
the "Alumni Son was fairly well
hung In spite of the assistance of some
dozen alumni. The local hits which

were scattered in, caused some amuse-

share to Carr: the Concert to its great

Last l\'ediles(lay evening at seven-
tllirty the Good Government League or
the College met ill Herrick chapel and
utter-the rolls or the men’s literary so~
cieties had been taken. Paul P. Far-
rens, chairman oi the meeting. intro-

duced Attorney General Byel who
spoke on the subject “Law Enforce
ment."

Mr. Byel emphasized from the ﬁrst
that the problem of properly eniorcing
the law is one oi the most serious ones
beiore the country today. and the he
cessitr tor the people to get into closer
relations with each other and work to-
wards the solution oi this problem.
“The entorcemeut ol the laws should
be the political religion oi every man.”
said Mr. Ever

Tile laws for the protection or prop-
erty are enrol-cod and tllo vigilance oi
the ofﬁcers oi the law in preventing
alrd punishing robbery and murder is
very satrsiactory, but the public oth-
cers have entirely overlooked the thing
which is oi equal importance. the pro»
tection oi public morals. Moreover.
eacll persorl is apt to think his duty
iulnlled it he looks alter the morale
oi his own ramily. willinlly disregard-
ing breaches of the law which operate
to the destruction or the public moc-
als.

Mr. Byel told how inﬁnitely worse
is the crime or the man who destroys
the morals at a young person by main-
tninance of illegal traffic, than that of
the men who takes the property of an
other. because he is, perhaps. cold and
shelterless. ‘

“But we have come to the

public ofﬁcers must eniorce laws pro-
tecting public morals as well as those
protecting property.

During the la l: years there has been
a marked improvement along this line
and {L great deal of lllegal business has
been done duzly with. In alyear with
the machinery for eniorcing the law
