Caliph ofSilicon Valley

by Dave Piston

Grinnell College Trustee and Chairman
of the Intel Corporation Robert Noyce, ’49,
was honored by the Grinnell Chamber of
Commerce at a luncheon at the Grinnell
Country Club last Friday.

Professor Emeritus of Physim Grant
Gale, tormer instructor of Noyce’s while at
Grinnell, introduced him as the “caliph of
silicon valley” before the audience of Grin-
nell businessmen. ,

The Chamber of Commerce declared
Friday, November 4, Robert Noyce Day in
Grinnell.

In response to questions, Noyce stressed
the importance of Grinnell's “growing sera
vice sector." He cited Grinnell College and
the new industrial park south of the town
as two major pluses in luring sud’i “brain-
intensive" industries to the area.

Noycesaid the future of the electronics
industry lies in “a marriage between com-
puter technologies and information
technology.” He foresees the day when one
will be able to access plane schedules from

home by linking ones home computer to

the airline's database.

Noyce says that there is perhaps an
“over-emphasis on the computer as an end
in itself,” especially in me home computer
ads which imply that children without
computer skills will do poorly in school.
Rattler, computers should be thougit of as
a tool, in the same way as reading would
never be treated as an end in itself, But he
points out one advantage of the computer

is Uiat it “forces clarity of methodology"
in the sense that a computer does only
what it's told to do.”

“The proper management of tedlnnlogy
is to find real problems and real solutions.
A viable technology must, within a
reasonable period of time, produce
benefits to society which justify is cost.
One must be very careful not to get too
enamored with what can be done, but with
what is practical to do." said Noyce.

Soon after his family moved to Grinnell
while he was in the 9th grade, Noyce show-
ed his promise as a future businessman.
To earn money, Noyce would arrange to
shovel snow off neighbors’ walks and
driveways for the entire winter for a flat
fee. After the contract was agreed upon,
Noyce said he “went home, and prayed it
wouldn't snow.” He added that “you win

. some, and lose some” in that business.

After the meeting, Noyce said that the
award as a Grinnell student he was most
proud of was ﬁle “Brown Derby." The
award was voted by the Grinnell students
for the “person who got by the best, by do-
ing the least,” said Noyce. The Brown Der-
by is no longer presented each year.

Probably his best known exploit as a stu
dent is known as the hog Story. While a
Grinnel] student, he was suspended for a
semester for stealing a hog from a local
farm.

“It was really a pig" says Noyce of the
animal. Noyce butchered the pig in the
women's showers fora pig roast with some
friends.

Divestment issue

still haunts

by Eric Green

Tensions are building once again bet-
ween the Board of Trustees and the South
African Support Group (SASG), despite
the compromise agreement made in May,
1982. SASG feels that the Board and the ad
minsitration have not lived up to the terms
ﬁt the compromise and the SASG itself is

ecoming increasingly impatient with the
moderate position the compromise forces
them to adopt.

The compromise was agreed upon at the
May 1982 Board of Trustees meeting, after
members of snsc unexpectedly intruded
on a previous Board meeting. instead or
divestment of Grinnell's shares in com-
panies that conduct business in South
Africa, which SASG was demanding, the
Board agreed to allow the concerns of the
Grinnell community to be felt “within the
corporate system."

To facilitate Trustee-student com—
munications, the Board established the
Committee on shareholder Responsibility.
This committee was intended to consult
with SASG to determine the College's posi-
tion on stockholder resolutions pertaining
to South Africa. According to John Price
'60, who chairs the three member commit»
tee, the compromise gave the SASG the
authority to vote the shares of the College
on issues concerning South Africa.

In the opinion of Jim Hunter, who cur-
rently heads SASG, the Shareholder
Responsibility Committee has not lived up
to the group’s expectations. Following the
Trustee’s meeting last Saturdaypﬂunter
dcided to air his frustrations in a letter (a
copy of which ﬁle 5&3 has obtained) to the'
three committee members.

In the letter, Hunter charges that. in do
fiance of the compromise, the Treasurer‘s
office has not “informed the campus com-
munity when relevant proxies have
arisen,” Consequently, during the spring
of low, “the Treasurer [sic] failed to vote
all three relevant proxies on which the Col-
lege Could have voted,” Hunter's letter
claims that the SASG has initiated all coma
munications with the Treasurer concern-
ing proxies and that the Treasurer's office
has “repeatedly delayed releasing the col»
lege’s [sic] stock portfolio, without which
the group cannot work on proxies."

College Treasurer Robert Anderson said
that there had been some confusion bet-
ween his office and the SASG regarding
the stock portfolio because his office
regularly releases such information at the
end of June and September and he was un~
sure if snsc wanted last spring's report

coHege

since proxies are normally voted in the
spring. SASG now has the fall portfolio.

Anderson also Said that his office needed
time to obtain proxy material because the
college employs a trust company to
monitor the daily activities of stock owner
ship. Under these circumstances, he said
that it was impossible to take action last
spring. Anderson stressed that his office
was prepared to help the SASG in obtain-
ing desired information,

Hunter was also disillusioned with the
shareholder Committee, especially follow
ing last Weekend when the Trustees‘
schedule did not permit the Committee to
meet with SASG. Hunter blames the Presi-
dent’s oiiice for not plannning such a
meeting. “We should be on their agenda
without having to hassle them about it.”
The President’s office told SASG that their
request for a meeting came too late.

Despite the increased friction, SASG is
planning to introduce a resolution at IBM’s
annual shareholder meeting in March The
resolution, purely a symbolic gesture,
calls on IBM's management to cease
operations in South Africa.

“They are one of the most well known
corporations in South Africa. There is no
way that they are innocent of not further
ing the system of apartheid," said Hunter.
Hunter said he is not optimistic the
Shareholder Responsibility Committee
will approve of the resolution.

Hunter noted that most members of
SASG are not satisfied with the com-
promise because divestment is no longer
the group's primary goal. He said that
after he graduates in December, the group
is likely to discard the compromise and
once again press the Trustees on the
divestment issue.

“Most members are at the point of
iorgetting this [proxy resolutiors] and
calling for divestment,” he said. Hunter
emphasized that SASG needs to continue
actively ecnouraging divestmentalthough
the prospects for immediate success are
dim. “It’s some people's opinion that me
Trustees are playing a waiting game ~ ii
the snso goes out of existence, the issue
will go out of existence.”

Owen Charles, another SASG member,
believes the group should shift its focus
back to divestment. He said that
stockholder resolutions are “not a remedy
for anything in South Africa. The most imr
portant thing we can do is divest.” Charles
maintained that divestment is not radical
because over loo colleges and universities,
as well as the Lutheran Church, have all
divested their holdings in companies doing
business in South Africa.

Joint Board considers the elimination of student activism

by M. Wolfgang Schumann

Junior Jim Gillespie took the floor at
Joint Board this-week to criticize the way
SGA is handling its wave of political ass
tivism, and to propose the elimination oi
the not-yet-formed Committee on Student
Politics (CSP). He plans to introduce a
proposal next week that would keep .15
from acting on national and international
issues unless they directly affect the
students.

Gillespie took exception to the formation
at the csp, whose members were to be ap-
pointed and confirmed this VIC/dis Marc
Lambert, the committee chairman, had
not made his selectioxw bv that time ’
the matter was postpo: u to next we

“What the committee [CSE'] it
say there are twelve liuno ed
on a petition and that ow the ('0 age
feels.‘ That should not be done in the name

oi students,” said Gillespie.

SGA Vice~President Pete Hautzinger, a
key supporter of CSP, mponded to
Gillespie, saying, “If you have a problem
wtih that, then you are saying that Joint
Board is not a valid elected body. . . I think
it’s entirely appropriate. 1 think it's kinda
pointless to deal with purely fiscal mat-
tars."

Treasurer Robby Sckalor concurred “i
don't see how you can separate politics

from government.”

Debate over the proper role of SGA in
politics has. been going since Dave
Kopelman first introduced a resolution
condemning the Sons: downing of Flight
#007. At that time, most of Jomt Board’s
members went against Kopelman’s pres
posal mainly because they ielt that it was
not their role to speak out on international
politics. -

Kopelman’s October resolution denounc-

ing the Solomon. Amendment, which
prevents men from receiving tederal
financial aid, was easier to rally SGA sup-
port for because it more directly impacs
students‘ lives.

The Kopelman resolutions were largely
responsible tor Joint Board establishment
of the Committee on student Politics as a
handler of political resolutions belore they
are considered by the entire SGA body.
The action that created the committee ex-
plicitly stated that its role was to be strict
ly advisory and that it was only to help
students present their ideas, not to affect
the content of a proposal.

When \7lce»President l-lautzinger asked
Gillespie whether he had read the bylaw
that created CSP Gillespie replied that he
had only "heard it paraphrased."

“i do not approve of anything coming
from the student government saying -
is how the siudsnts feel.’ it's not h e

you're the House of Representatives of the
United States," said Gillespie. Gillepie’s
plan would be for Joint Board to process
whatever resolutions it. sees fit, and then to
put out petitions to be signed by the in
dividual students themselves, so that no
one would feel bound by a statement with
which they disagree.

Hautzinger at that point told Gillespie
that “a better way to pursue your goals
[would be to] propose to disband Joint
Board." Most of those attending seemed
surprised or amused, but at least two up-
perclassmen, Kopelman and Wes Joe, had
expressed ideas to that effect

The debate moved on for over half an
hour and President lon Scharffrepealedly
encouraged shorter speeches and twice
had to cut off new names from Lhe list of
speakers. No action was taken at this
week’s meeting because no formal motion
was made Gillespie. however, will be
back next week with his proposal and tile
matter should come to a vote,
