After nearly a Year’s repose in their
various places of rest the spiked shoe
is being brought forth by the cinder-
path artists. From the one or two
men who are taking workouts a week
or so ago the number has increased
to about ﬁfteen at the present time.

It is expected that the number will
increase rapidly now that the time for-
indoor nieets is drawing near. The
ﬁrm indoor meet will probably’be the
Big Four meet at Amos. This meet
was originated last year by the his
four' of Iowa Athletics, ioiva, Arncs.
Ciinnell, and Drake. The meet was
held at Allies and if it is held this
year will be held there again as Ames
is the only school in the state which
has sufficient floor space and a track
large enough to stage an indoor afe
fair. The date will he March 1, or
atout that time.

No Illinois Relays This Yblu'.

The annual Illinois indoor Relays
will not be held his year, due to vitrir

eral years, and a team would prob-
ably have been sent this year.

Prospects for a successful track sea-
son this year look fairly good at the
pr out time. Vinsel, stock. Gordan,
Evans. Ho t, Ellsworth, Su'illelmrt,
Con-don. H cks, Bocllmlel', and Hen

compete on the cinder path this
spring. Fleck and Molllnrray are tr,
ing to gel. their discharges, but know
nothing definite as to the time at which
they will be mustered out of the serv—
ice.

The schedule for the spring events
includes two big meets, the State meet
at Dos Monica and the Missouri Valley
meet at Allies. Besides these meets
a dual iii-ts been carded with hebraskn

Game Is Fast and Scrappy In
Spite of Many Fouls Antl
0ne»Sided Score.

Cornell took the long end of a 3171s
score in tlic Grinneleoi-nell game
played at Mount Vernon last night,
The game was hard fought thruout al-
tho the score does not indicate
that fact. Cornell made most of
her points on long shots from near-
the center of the floor. '

Cornell scored ﬁrst and kept the
lead thruout the grime. Keple the
lanky Cornell center. shot ﬁve ringer-s
in the first half from near the center
of the floor. Only twice during the
entire‘ game did Cornell make baskets
within close range of the hoop. The
Scarlet ﬁve watched them so closely
that they were forced to shoot from
long range but made most of their
shots count.

Plli)‘ Defensive Game.

Both tennis played on the defensive
most of the game and fast teamwork
and good passing was necessary to get
the ball under the basket for a short
shot. The ﬁrst half ended 21-11 for
Cornell.

Shortly after the opening of the sce-
ond half Crane was put out on four
personals. Gettys then took the pivot
position. The second half was slower .
than the ﬁrst. Cornell still had the
horseshoe and pushed in several more
shots from long range Near the end
of the half Linn and Kepler collided,
keoler losing three of his teeth, and
Linn being forced to retire from the
game with a had gash over the eye.

Cornell Drops In Many Fitnls.

Cornell also showed more ability
lrorn the foul line than did Grinnell.
ot the ten fouls called on Griunell
Kepler tossed in seven out of ten.
Fourteen fouls were called on Cornell.
Hammond was only able to get in three
in eleven tries at the basket and Evans
made one out of three. In spite of
the fact that so many fouls were
called during the game the play was
clean and fast.

Grinnell will play the next ﬁve
Igamcs on the local court beginning
with Drake next Saturday right, Drake
defeated Nebraska last night at Line
coin. so ha. ct fans may look forward
to a hard battle.
