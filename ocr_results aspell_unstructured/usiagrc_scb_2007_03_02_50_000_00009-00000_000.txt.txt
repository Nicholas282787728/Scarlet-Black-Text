Comic offensive

Recently, Chalntzim distributed a Cartoon
by Christine McCormick '09 and Allison
Rosenthal ‘09 that begins with a child asking
a Rabbi, “\lVliat’s Puiim,> My dad drinks and
dresses up like a woman] don’t get it..."The
Rabbi then proceeds to explain that drinking
is a part of the Purim celebration, and in the
penultimate panel the child asks, “But why
does Dad dress like a woman?" and the Rabbi’s
voice bubble in response simply says

So, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems
like the punchline to this cartoon is that the
child’s dad is tiansgendeiecl or a transvestite,
and that this is somehow funny. This leaves me

wondering: will there be further opportunities
to mock the GLETCHA community at the
Clialutzim Purim celebration on March 3, or
is the Small’l‘nlnded bigotiy going to be lim»
itetl to the event’s ad campaign‘

Lessons of Purim

Dent Billy,

In our last conversation, you seemed to be
questioning your father's dressing habits on the
sacred day otPurrrn I just want you to know
that Purim is more than a holiday of‘diunken
revelry, as you young folks like to call it. Just
as Moideehai questioned the legitimacy of
Humans power by nor bowing to him, it is our
duty as Jews to challenge oppression and defy
social norms. That is how we get the tradition
of costummg as a means ot'iesisting rigid ethr
aic, racial, class and gender boundaiies. I don’t
ever want to speculate on something so per-e
sonal as your father's sexuality or his preferred
gender idciitityaiid I feel that you should have
this conveisation with him instead of some
“small-minded bigot."

Have a fun time at Purim Saturday night

What do IA, KS, AK and Heaven all

As you may know, a week ago former Iowa
Governor Torn Vilsaek dropped out of the
presidential race, making my last column (two
weeks ago) pretty much completely obsolete.
In memory ofTon-i Vilsack and the spirit of
timelessness, I thought this week I'd take a
look at three tnore presidential candidates
likely to fail on their journeys to 1600 Penn
sylvania Ave.

First, there's former Alaska Senator Mike
Gravel, who is running for the Democratic
nomination for
President. Grav-
cl (pronounced
GrahsVEL) is one
of those old-time
good guys who
you really want to
like, but who you
know isn't going to get anywhere.

In 1971, as the Junior Senator from Alasr
ka, he led a one-man filibuster in the Senate
that forced Richard Nixon to rescind the draft,
You might also recognize his last name from
Glam! o. (15., a landmark Supreme Court
case that resulted after he released the Nixon
administration's classified “Pentagon Papers”
that same year. Very few people can claim to
have been more instrumental in ending the
Vietnam war than Gravel.

in 1980, he lost reelection after being tars
getcd by none other than Jerry Falwell. Since
then, Gravel has championed the cause of na—
tional referendums. He wants to amend the
Constitution to allow for VOICY‘inItIatcd legis-
lation on a federal level. Oh. and ifelected, he

will abolish the IRS and the income tax and
make the federal government's primary source
of income a national sales teLY. Thcsc arcn't
exactly mainstream ideas. While I'd love him
for a grandparent, it isn't likely he’ll ever be
president.

Second, l’ll mention Kansas Republican
Senator Sam Brownback, the anointed eandk
date of the radical religious right. Baptized
by a political wing of Opus Dei (yes, tear
Opus Dei), Brownbaek became a Methodist
and, most recently,
r1 Catholic, over the
course of his politic
cal career.

His positions on
social issues are so
extreme that they
have alienated pow,
crful members of the Kansas Republican Party
(including former Senator Bob Dole himself)
— and they aren’t exactly moderates. For in-
stance, he has opposed American handing for
AIDS prevention projects in Africa on the
grounds that distributing free condoms there
will encourage too much immoral behavior.
A few months ago, Brownback spent a night
in a maximum security prison in Louisiana as
some kind of publicity stunt. No one is quite
sure why.

Senator Brownback's political idol is Jesse
Helms, and he wants to be your president.
But, like Helms, he has gone on record Says
ing too many crazy things (e.g., “Lobbyists
are children of God, tool") for his campaign
to ever get traction, and that’s probably for the

Poster profanity

Tiuth be told: I would die in a ditch for
{rec spccch. I don't think there are hard and
fast rules on what words you cart and can’t use
in public speech. So, I'm using this space to
question why an SGA postei advertising an ap-

1 atioil deadline extension featured the word
‘bitchcs.’ Originating in the 1400s, the term
bitch has designated unpleasant or uncontrolc
lablc women. Some radical feminists ieelaini
the woid bitch for piogressive, pie—woman
use. But in most modern contexts such as the
SGA poster, even when bitch doesn't directly
refer to a woman it denotes subjugation and
connotes negativity, derived from historical at
titudes towaids the feminine. When SGA

group that touts itself as the voice of all Stu:

applications for its lcadcrship positions, what
does that say about the interests that SGA rec
ally serves? .
*S/Il‘ﬂ/J Lu '07

have in common?

best.

Finally, consider Republican president
tial candidate ”Lord Saint Michael Jesus
The Archangel," His campaign sire (arche
angelmichaelanfo) is titled, “MICHAEL’S
HEAVENLY VIRTUAL 2008 RADICAL
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN PRESs
IDENTIAL CAMPAIGN,” and it plays a
video (with full sound) from T/ie Mama vid»
eogaine, The video, Lord Saint MichaelJcsus
predtcts,wil.l help us “ACHIEVE VICTORY
OVER SATAN!" (I'm pretty sure it’s just the
normal trailer for the videogamc, though, so
if you've seen it, you may well have already
achieved victory over Satan.)

It is not clear, unfortunately, whether Lord
Saint Michael Jesus has even filed papers dec
claring his candidacy, but he has definitely be
gun accepting “contributions"— or so his web
site suggests. In fact, the whole thing sounds
a lot like an illegal pyramid scheme started
by a really crazy guy with too much time on
his hands. And, wh e I’m sure political cams
paigns have been started on less, it doesn’t
seem likely that this one will get veiy far.

At some point in every American’s child-
hood, someone inevitably says,“Soineday, even
you can be president." Most people learn,years
later, that it isn’t really true. Unfortunately,
many people over the past two centuries never
got the memo. Now, if anyone ever asks you
“What do Tom Vilsaek and Lord Saint Mi-
chaelJesusThe Archangel have in commoni“,
you'll already know the punch—line.
