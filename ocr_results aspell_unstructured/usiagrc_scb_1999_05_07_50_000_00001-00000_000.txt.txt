The rally seemed to spark the most emor
tion from the participants, as many sins
dents, including Kencpp, bravely revealed
their personal stories oipasr assault.

“1 was one orthe spcakcrs tor the event,
so that required a lot olmcntal preparation
and feeling nervous and sweaty that l was

about to tell a room full orpeople part of

very impressed by tlrc rally, I thought the
rest or rlre speakers were really wonderful,
and I know that people felt empowered or.
ter they shared their story or poem or a
sang,..l was really proud of myseliand the
other speakers for sharing our experiences

Mullins iilsa espressed a strong emo-

Student Initiatives

SGA is holding elections for two student initiatives on Monday. i/oting will be in
the post office during the day, and in the dining halls during dinner. The pro-

posed initiatives are as follows:

Reforming Number Draw

Background; Number draw is a superﬂuous process. Returning stu-
dents in past years have been forced to draw their numbers by hand for
the room draw lottery This process is extremely inemeienr. Herding a
large percenragc of the student body into a lounge to draw numbers
would only be eitective irwe had no way to replicate the process,

Proposal: We propose that we rake advantage orsome basic technol.
ogy and randomly assign, by class, numbers to studenrswrth which they
will draw their rooms. The numbers assigned to students would be made
publicvia email or posting in public areas (eg. post omco & Forum). /\
process which would randomly generate numbers and assign drum to
srudenrs would provide for an emeienr and crrectivc way of ordering
students tor draw. This proposal will only have beneﬁts. Drawing minis
bcrs by hand, asstated before, is inerhcient and time consuming rorbnrlr
students and administrators. Nothing will he lost in the process it a ran»
dom number generator assumes the charge orassignirrg numbers to sun
dents,

students now must selccr a number from a bowl, The numbers in the
bowl, available to a particular studcnr are dependant on the student's
class year. This would not change as the random number generator rv orrld
generate numbers according to class year as well. we understand that this
new method would eliminate a certain amount orsupersririous activity
that is now part oinumber draw. ,.,bnt honestly il‘yon have to clost» your
eyes and spin around three times before you choose the number, inst save
it {or room draw. A random nurnborgcneratorrvould be no loss ciioerivc,
and would be more eirecrrve than the current system ornurnber draw.

Chlorine Free Paper Products

rally,

“Nthe lanterns are a creative way for sur.
vivors ofscxual assault and their supports
ers, to increase awareness, and it is a way to
heal through scliaihrmation," said Kencpp.

“I csptcially like the lanternsebeeause
they symbolize rhe light within us all, and
as survivors we have to hold on to that light,
and remember that our assailant cannot
take our spirit away from us. “

Erin Mullins shared her views on why
events such as Take Back the Night are im.
portant, ‘

“I think events like these are obviously
important tor the people on campus who
can identity with issues ofscxual violence.
And irthe rally is any indication, then most
people can, These events are empowering
and they also serve to educate and raise
awareness on the campus, “ she said-“Vlosl
importantly, in my opinion, they give
women a chance to come together and stand
unihed against sexual violence. “

Mullins also sees the importance orthe
evcnts last week, because of the awareness,
and the support and healing they provide
rile victims.”

Future plans have already begun For next
year's Take Back rhe Night week, and will
include more activities intended to get more
people involved. PAC will be sponsoring a
workshop and showing movies in order to
increase rhe dialogue and awareness about
these issue on campus.

“I think that a lot oipeople on this cam.
pus reel like they already know aboursertual
violence and sexism and that they would
never reed inlo that sickncss," said one PAC
member. “The problem is that it is still
happening in Grinncll. The fact sends a
pretty strong message that crinnell is not
immune just because we say we are a lib-
eral institution." '
