Your Rubbish Is Showing

It has been brought to our attention by
the disappearance of the snow and the
coming- of sp -ing that there exists here on
campus, particularly in front of the library,‘
around the bookstore, and ill front of ARI—I
a large quantity of paper, cigarette butts,
old love letters, newspapers, candy wrap-
pers, beer labels, etc.

At ii We blamed this unsightly coll-
glomeratlon upon holdovers from the pro—
paganda tossed around by Student Coulis
cll candidates. However, after containing
ourselves for about a month and a half, we
find tllat, although the propaganda has dis-
appeared, the quantity of rubbish has, if
anything increased.

We feel that with the‘ large number
of visitors, which will be on the campus
from now through Commencement, students
might attempt to keep the campus heater.
A little more accuracy with a used cigars
ette, a little more patience before ridding
oneself of excess circulars (don’t fire ’til
you see the rim of the basket) and our
campus might cease to resemble a city
dump.

 

Comes The Revquﬁon

This is it, Grinnellians. The good 01’
Veterans’ Administration has been run out
of business, and all because a few far-
sighted: committees on campus have decid-
ed to ve that Grinnell dates are two-way
propositions. With the advent of Coveds’
Cash Week, the inmates of the Quadrangle
will dig into those motlnridden purses their
poppas gave them when they came to Grin-
nell 'way back in September. (See that five
dollar bill? Mad money, they call i. But
it hasn’t been cashed yet.)

The reasons for the financial switch are
obvious, biit it might be wise to mention to
backward members of the community the
delay in the G. I. checks, the fifty-dollar
“faith” deposits, and other factors draining
masculine pockets in the Spring.

At least 50% of the campus is backing
this tradition-making event. With the pro«
per spirit from the east, there is no rea-
son why it can’t become something to make
Grinnell famous. Where else will a girl have
a chance to prove how much she appreciated

of the other favors that have been bestow—
ed upon her throughout the year?

On Tuesday, May 5, men should expect
a call from the little woman, suggesting a
roll-and-coffee breakfast. Perhaps on Wed-
nesday, they’ll dash to the Iowa for a peep
at Ingrid Bergmann, Thursday is usually
quiet; a coke in the afternoon, cigarettes
and coffee after an evening in the “Libe.”
On Friday it might be a good idea to splurge ‘
on steaks; there’s a wide price range, from
the lowly hamburger to the extra fancy
t-bone for two. Take your pick.

Saturday, of course, is the JuniorsSen-
ior Prom, the event of the year. The wo-
men will be expected to provide the tickets;
the orchids are up to the men, as are any
refreshments during the evening, (A girl
won‘t want to bother with a billfold or purse
at a formal) Sunday should be quiet; break-
fast substantial, of course), and the offer-
ing at college church. Dinner is on the col-
lege, but of course supper should be some—
thing extra-special to celebrate the end of
a week long to he remembered,

This helpful schedule is only a hint.
Perhaps a few girls will suggest picnics.
The suggestion should be taken in the right
spirit, because a picnic can mean almost
anything. Whatever your plans for the Co»
ed’s Cash Week, make it a worthy experi-
ment.

Nelson North spoke on “Poetry
Manuscnpts as the Editor Sees
Them.” She said that getting
poetry accepted by the maga-
zines is harder than ever before.
and said that Poetry magazine
sends out from 5.000 to 11,000 re-
jection slips 2 year.

Miss North gave six points of
advice to striving poets: “(1) Try
for facility of language. (2) Try
to have a theme and method of
treatment. (3) Try for a complete
freshness of phrase. (4) Have a
knowledge of psychology. (5» ob.
