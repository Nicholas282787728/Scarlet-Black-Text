Food For Thought

On page seven of this isslle is a reprinted editorial
from the Des Moines Register, commenting on the change
ill academic program at Yale university. The Register ap-
proves of the changes, and suggests that other schools
might gain by their adoption , ‘

. While the changes that Yale llas.adopted are not
exactly revolutionary (they appear more to be a new ver-
sion of the original European university, program), they
represent a change in the Ameri an educational tradition.
.ﬁather than attempting to force students ‘-to study and
go to class, it assumes their interest and willingness to
Wol'ii

Grinnell, as a small college of high reputation, might
gain from a change to' this type of educational system. The
facﬁllty should at least look into its possibilities for Grin-
nc . \

Thanks-

Just a quick note of thanks to the Foods department.
The Homecoming dance wouldn't have been a Homecom-

College mothers are probably
underpaid, if you cc pare them
to the other DI‘OECSS
ing cxtensive naming,
compared with other schools,
Grinnell faculty salaries are
generally superior. i have a
shcaf of statistics that assert the
following facts and many more
in some detail. or 223 privately
supported small colleges. we are
far above the average. Grinnell
has the highest salary rzmgc in
the Midwest conference, closely
followed by Carleton. A survey
of as church and endowed un-
iversities and 36 such colleges
showed: Grinuell out ahead on
all counts, especially among the
colleges, Even a survey at (ill
istate universities (not including
“professional" colleges) and 2i
state liberal arts colleges show-I
ed that, while Griniiell was bets
‘tered by the universiues on the
tsp three of the four raculty
ranks, Grinnell considerably bets
,tcrcd the colleges. Congrats to
the trustees and President
lStevens himself, who personally
lraised an extra 32 ,000 for salar-
ies this summer.

The recent student riots at
,Iowa State are interesting, Cole
‘lege students in many parts of
,the u rid are often the leaders
in contemporary political or»
pressi‘on and the like, and a
riot now and then is considered
a matter of course. American‘
students seldom riot about any-
bhing, and when they do, it us-
ually indicates what the Ames
riots did: the only thing there
is st g agreement about among
Ame can students is that they
don't want to go to class.

My condolenoss to Dave Patsy:
erstwhile fellow student and
another victim of the unfair
"local option" draft law, which
the politicians were afraid to
make explicit. Some boards do»

From the President. . .

There is something nice and satisfying about the word
“Homecoming.” In fact I think it is one of the loveliest
words in the English language. It is particularly meaning-
ful to those of us here at Grinllell who through the years
have found in the College community so many precious
elclllents that have given us a sense of belonging, an e
pcriellce of mutual goodwill, and an opportunity for com-
mon service. _

Returning to Alma Mater is at once a source of Joy
and all act of devotion. Those of us who are here welcome
you. The familiar scene, the (traditional homecoming fes-
tivities, the friendly good will of students and faculty are
yours. We hope that they will be a rich reinforcement to
memories tllat will come back as you walk these campus
ways again We want this to be a good weekend.

The teamrwill do its best to give us a victory They
are a fine group of boys, coached by an excellent staff 0t
coaches, We are sure that they will do their best. Victory
or no victory, that best will be good enough for us.

We hope that you will get acquainted with the stu-
dents, seniors to freshmen, and ~alize that this studenl

'5 ill line with our best tradl ons.
‘ ‘Illd perhaps most important of all, we hope
that your visit to the campus will make you w nt to re-
turn soon again. Our house is yours. Whatever we can do
to make your stay a pleasant one will be done.

Le‘Hers ToKThe Editor

To the Editor: l

Last week, as Chairman of to the faculty as a basis for dis-
thc Faculty, 1 received a letter cussion a letter grading System
about the new srhdmg system “comparable to that used in an
which was signed by several overwhelming majority of other

hundred studentsi, May I take
this way of acknowledging pubs
liciy my receipt of this request
for clarification and may I as
sure the student body that the
faculty \Vlll give the matter
careful consideration. ,

icon, of course, make no
reply on behalf of the faculty,
at this time. i should like;
however, to mention briefly two
matters of fact in regard to:
(l) The background of faculty:
legislation on grades last spring
and (2) The administration of
the new grading system,

Last semester, Dean ruller as
Chairman of the Educational
Policies committee of the foo—l
ulty asked the registrar to makel
a study of the grading systems;
of representative liberal arts'
colleges comparable to Grinnell
and of universities wlﬁch or»,
diuarily accept graduate and
professional students from Grins
nell. ,

This study by the registrar
showed that the overwhelming
nnjority of these institutions‘
used a letter grading system
with four passing gradesiA, B,
c and D. Since certain deficien-
cies of our numerical system of
grading had come to be widely
recogniz d amongst the faculty,

es committee presented

. STRAND

liberal arts colleges and by
leading graduate schools includ
ing those to which we sent most
of our graduate students."

This letter grading system was
presented at one faculty meet-
ing and adopted at another
meeting two weeks later. The
action ol the lfaculty was de—
signed to bring GrinneLl into
line with the standard grading
practices prevailing in the na—
tion's lending colleges and uni-
, 'es. In the past, misunder-
standings in translating our
numerical grades to their letter
equivalents have hampered some
of our transfers and graduates
