.trr eurreaty that uriniiell should

Music has always hot-u a natural
and spontaneous expression ot the Keel»

niaii racc, said Dr. Steiner. The tolk
song is the hasis oi lnrr cnl develops
merit, and while all nations have their-
own iolk songs, the Americans have
none. Tho Americans are not a sing

sccndency irorn people oi no common
tradition.

We have hecome, said the speaker,
soitglcss and even cheerless, never giv»
iug expression to our ieeiings as a
group or music. iir. Steiner urged
that the students ot Gl'illiiell should
sing more in chapel and Vesper Wot»
ship is social and the main expression
is the singing in praising Gotl togeth—
cr, he said. We lose much ot our ic-
lrgious inheritance and source oi powa

The pica made throughout his talk
was that (it-irirrell should hccome a
