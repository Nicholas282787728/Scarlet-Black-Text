Secretary, Student Council
Grime“ College

January 21, 1955

The Personnel Board has been very much interested in study-
ing the request of the Student Council for an extension of the
Thanksgiving vacation. We received your letter in reference to
this request during the week before the Christmas vacation, and

our reply has of necessity been

delayed until we could make a

report to the faculty concerning the academic calendar for the

year 1955-6. '

Last Monday we were able to present our report to the facule
ty, and l am now enclosing a copy of the calendar which was
adopted at that meeting. You will notice that the Thanksgiving
recess is similar to this year’s and allows only the one day free
from classes. The resolution which 1 also, enclose indicates the
regret of the faculty at having to send a negative answer to a
request from the Student Council. However, arguments which
seemed quite strong against the extended vacation were based on
the arrangement of the New Student Days program, an the staff
and budget problems, and. on the personal problems which would
be experienced by those students who would remain i'n'Grlnnell
during the long Thanksgiving weekend. This year 136 students
are Enrolle'd from States and foreign countries at a distance of
more than 500 miles. others from nearby states could not afford
the expense of the weekend away so near the Christmas vacation.

_ ,Your letter stated that students would like a longer Thanks-
giving vacatlo‘n “under the condition that the additional days will
be made up at the beginning of the school year.” We interpret
this Statement as lmplylng student disapproval of any shortening

of the Christmas or Spring vacations, or a lengthening of the
second semester in June. The faculty decided not to begin classes
for the new_year at the end of a week but to continue our pre—
ferred practice of opening classes on a Monday, This will be the
loch of September, and New Student Days will open on the 14th.
This means that the freshmen will arrive on the lath, and upper-
class leaders will be cordially invited to arrive on the 10th. I
shall appreciate your sharing this letter with the members of the
council and expressing to them the good wishes of the Personnel

Board and of the faculty.

Yours sincerely.

vention is to nominate two
candidates for the final ballot,
We already-have these two can-
didates so there is no need for
a convention,"

Other factors in the decision
were the high school basketball
game scheduled for Darby gym
that night which‘would have
required the convention to end
at 5 p.m., and the Valentine
formal scheduled for 9 p.m. that
evening. The cost and work in-
volved in planning a conven-
tion were also considered in view
of the fact that no new nonlin-
ations could be made and no
elimination was possible,

The Student Council consti-
tution makes no mention of
a convention. It specifics only
that three elections sluu be
held for the selection of the
Student Council maident—a
primary, secondary, and ﬁnal
election. The constitution also
provides that these electi n5
shall be under the supemslon
and control of the Election
Board. There is no way 0!
changing or overruling a de-
cision ol' the board.

In view of these provisions,
the Election Board decided to
leave the primary election as it
has been in the past: merely the
submitting of nominating peti-
tions to the board.

Formerly the secondary elec-
tion consisted of the nominating
convention. This year it was
replaced by a vote taken in the
student Council meeting last
night which consisted of appr0v~
ing George Drake and Ken KaSSr

night the S&B made a spot survey in the Union to de-
tel'mme the student sentiment toward the idea 'of dropping
the convention. Several students were asked: “What s
your reaction to the fa'ct that there will be no convention
this year?" Their answers follow. ,

At an all-college convocation at

chapel, his subject will be “The
Crisis of F:eedom in America";
in the afternoon he will take
part in an informal discussion
in Main lounge beginning at
3:15 pm; and in his evening
address at a p.m. in Herrick
chapel, he will talk on “The
Challenge of the Future”.

One of America’s leading his—
torians, Schlesinger is cited by
the New York Times as ranking
”among the foremost in the new
generation of vigorous social
thinkers.” In 1946, at the age
of 28, he was the youngest his-
torian ever to Win the Pultizer
Prize, which he received for his
book, “The Age of Jackson." In
addition, he is the author of
vmany magazine articles and
three other books, including
‘The Vital Center", a “brilliant
discussion of contemporay :poe
litiacl and social problems,"

He was mum sum:

nun laude from Harvard

9 am. in Herrick

University in 1938, with his
honors essay being published
the following year. During the
war he served in the Ofﬁce
of War Information in Wash-
ington and in the Ofﬁce of
strategic Services in London,
Paris, and Germany. In 1941
he returned to Harvard as as-
sociate professor of hlstol’y.

Della Narcisi: They don’t head
a convention. it seems to me
that they should get more cand-
idates students see a futility
in trying to promote new ideas
as a leader in the student coun~
Cll.

Dick Turner: 1 think the
studentcounril convention is an
interesting experiment in caue
cus government. It's nice to see
how a caucus convention works,
at least ioi- those who haven’t
experienced it, My personal
feeling'is, i wouldn’t miss it,

Bob Barr: In the first place If
only tiwo candidates are i-unnnig
it is obviously stupid to have a
student council convention. But
i think it is somewhat strange
ohat out of the junior class there
aren't more than two people who
tool that they are qualified to
run.

Jim Ferguson: It seems to me
the convention is being held a
little early this year. student
interest has not reached it

peak. Perhaps this lack of in-
terest would indicate that the
convention should be held later
in the year.

Kay Fuller: it‘s a shame that
not enough in the junior class
have the gumption or pride in
themselves to run for student
council president. it seems to me
that they have a lot of potential
leaders.

Nick Ryan: l'm dissappointed.
it has been mentioned to me by
some seniors that they are tired
of this whole business. 1 hope '
this senioritis isn‘t too prevalent
on the calmrpus. (Nick was a
candidate last year).

Jackie Yeager: i think it’ll be
a good idea if they don’t have
one. it's been such a drag for
the last muple of years that l
ohink dropping the convention
for one year would not hurt. i
think it would be unwise to re-
open nominations for die pur-
pose of having convention.
