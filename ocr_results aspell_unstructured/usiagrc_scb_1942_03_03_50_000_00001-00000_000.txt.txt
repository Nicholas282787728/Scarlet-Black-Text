The Grillnell coed completely
outshone her burly brother,
the Gl‘innell male, when it
was revealed today that 12
men were falling to report to phy-
siom conditioning periods, while
the fair sex could boast a pezfect
record as far as deliquenoies, or
the lack of them, are concerned.

John C. Truesdale, professor of
physical education, turned in the
report on the males, while C'am
Julia Anderson, director of physi-
cal education for women, pointed
out the attendance virtues of the
coeds.

At the same time, Truesdole
announced the inauguration of a
5 p. in. conditioning class for men
who find it impossible to attend
earlier periods because of work
and laboratories. Dcfinlte plans
will be made later in the week,
Truesdsie said.

Truesdeie are Jack Fetig, William
Frantz, Peter Fryth, Richaio
Gadient. John Gaiisert, limos
Heimann, Albert Oliver, Kslmaii
Spelleticb, William Vance, William
Voiers, Roy Sclilieben, and Robert
Crandall.

some of these men bave work
or laboratory conflicts, but most
of the others are chronic cases
who do not believe in discipline
and regimentation, Trucsdale said.

Truesdsle added that a plan was
under way to give certificates to
all men helping to instruct the
conditioning periods.

Men who have been helping to
date include 'Arthur Werlein,

100 Coeds,Laching Experience, Show Vigior for Sewing

It's rip and tuck every inch of the
way in the “Y” building these
afternoons, but one or Grim-lell's
was efforts is beginning to make
real progress.

Lois Jean Gregg, Haines junior
and quadrangle chairman for Red
Cross sewing, reports that 12 dress-
es made by college women and
faculty wives were accepted for
the last shipment from Grimell.
That‘s just another way of saying
the campus sewing group is tum—
ing out perfect work, for only
flawless garments are accepted by
the Red Cross. But it’s been a
long. hard, and often humorous
fight, Miss Gregg added.

A. number of the 100 coeds who

signed up for the sewing project
had more patriotism and energy
than sewing experience, and for
the first two weeks the sewing
room turned out an all—time record
of pricked fingers and drooping
hems. Another Red Cross activity,
the first aid class, could have been
kept busy just removing the
wounded. “But things have
really straightened out now,” was
Gregg concluded. "a set of uni-
form directions, compiled by fa-
culty instructors, has given us
something concrete to work with.
and even the beginners are turn-
ing out thoroughly acceptable
Work."

According to observers of the

first fumbling days, the Perils of
Pauline were nothing compared to
the experiences of Betty "Jack
the Ripper" Young, who succeeded
after three days in drawing a
needle through material with no
damage to herself and practically
none to the cloth. Mary Ellen
Appleby was also a confused in
dividual until she decided dauble-
edged razor blades weren’t meant
for repair work.

Latest project of the chapter,
blanket robes for children, are go—
ing smoothly Work is done on
three electric sewing machines,
which were donated by the quad-
rangle, Mrs. John S. Nollen, and
Mrs. Shelton L. Bestty.
