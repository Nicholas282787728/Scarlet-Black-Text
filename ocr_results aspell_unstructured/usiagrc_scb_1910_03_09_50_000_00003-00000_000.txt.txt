It is reasonable to believe that we would
not constantly dwell upon the merit of
Adler’s Collegian Clothes if our experience
had not taught us to thoroughly respect
the Wonderful value one obtains when he
buys a garmem of this well known make.
In quality they have no equal. The best of
materials throughout is one of their strong
characteristics. When it comes to the
question of style, we have never seen gar—
ments from any other maker which
possess these artistic lines and which so
strongly appeal to the young marl, who
demands every feature of fashion. We
would like to show you a few of the new
Spring Suits and Cravenetts and let you
try on your size, whether you want to buy
or not.
