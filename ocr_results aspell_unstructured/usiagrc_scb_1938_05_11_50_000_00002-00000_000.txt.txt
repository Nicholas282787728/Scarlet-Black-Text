VITAL TO OUR NEEDS

Today marks the formal installation of
the newly elected Student Council. Perhaps,
in view of that fact, it is not amiss that we
again make some mention of the record of
the retiring Council and reiterate our hope
that the incoming Council will continue
active leadership in the solution of campus
problems.

We have said before that the Student
Council, under the leadership of John
Spence, has shown by its work this year
that a Student Council, fully aware of cam-
pus problems and willing to work towards
the solution of them, can and will accom—
plish much.

We are confident that the new Council
will continue, and perhaps improve upon,
the work done during the past year. In
our platform we have set folth some of the
objectives we would be eager to support.
The new Council may have others. It may,
on the other hand, disagree with some of
those listed.

Iopmcnl.

At any rate we desire to support the
Council in promoting such worthy objectives
as it may choose. Our only wish is that
they be many and above all, vital to the
needs of the college.

GLORY, LAUD AND HONOR

Don't be hasty in passing judgment if
you see a Grinnell tl'ackman holding his
nose at a slightly tilted angle. It would be
perfectly justifiable. Not that the thin-
clads have all caught colds; any slanting ele-
vation of a trackstel"s olfactory organ is
justifiable because of the fine work the
whole team did last Friday at the Beloit
Relays.

Seventeen schools came, 17 schools
saw, and one school (our own Grinnell) con-
quered. And speaking numerically,
thirds, one fourth and two fifths. A re-
markable showing.

Ponderously weighted with crowns,
laurels, wreaths and badges when they came
home, the boys have taken them off, secure-
ly putting them in the trophy cases, The
weight of their burden taken off their
shoulders, and the victory truly great, the
boys may now tilt their nosesithough we
know they won’t. Meanwhile, we sing
praises >

ONLY LOGICAL!

Finals in the women’s Spaulding speech
contest are to be held tonight, and again
Grinnell students will have the opportunity
of hearing speaking of exceptionally high
calibre.

Like many other campus attractions
the Spaulding contests are often passed up
on the fallacious assumption that because
the speakers are fellow students they will
have nothing in palticular to say and not
say that very well.

On the contrary, the speeches tonight
will be well worth while both from the
standpoint of subject matter and presenta-
tion. It is well to remember that we have
here at Grillnell a speech department which
holds its own with the best anywhere. It
is therefore only logical that honor students
in that department will be outstanding
speakers.

SOMETHING ﬁoﬁlsm

We are happy to note that sweaters
have been awarded to 17 members of the
college band who have participated in that
organization at least two years. Not alone
bec-use we believe in recognition for such
service, but because the awards are of new
sweaters authorized by the Student Council
this spring as part of the band reorganiza-
tion plan.

We are hopeful that other features of
the plan will become realities before long.

For a band as visioned by the plan will
be a distinct credit to Grinnell college, and
a decided incentive to school spirit and pep.

BOOK LOOKS [

Tlic Pulitzer price awards in
literature were shocks in almost
everybody. As Heywood Bloun
says, we ought to have a. week
called “Week for Disagreeing with
the Pulitzer Prize Awards.” The
library has the following ones:
Fictioni‘The Late George Ap-
ley" by Marquand; poetry—“Cold
Morning Sky" by Zcfurenska; bio-
grapnyi‘ﬁﬂaddler's Progress” by
Shepard, historyi‘ﬂ‘he Road to
Reunion” by Buck.

Mrs. Pryor has said that the
great Gcoi-gc Jean Nathan be-
haved just like a kitten about
the current New York Drama
Critic’s Award going to stem—
lbeck's “Of Mice and Men” (rental
shelf). Nathan's weekly theatri-
cal reviews in “News Week"
usually contain more apt felinity
than kittenishness, which make
“News Week" reviews still worth
reading even if Sinclair Lewis'
book column has been taken over
by the prcdcfoi-y Burton Rascoe.
