Men’s Basketball ready to rack up more points, records

while s curing a conference title.

I at, the team averaged close to 108 points per game,
but with an increased tempo this \car, expect to set even more
points on the board this season. “There's no qucstion wt' ll have

Over the past fcwycars, 6'8"Ccnter l<cith Chamberlain ‘08
more than adequately filled this role. But without Cliambep
lain, this year's team will simply Lun and shoot more. “Last year
we slowed down a lot for Keith," said Paint Guaid David Arsee
ncault '08. “[This year], shots will be flying from the Sepoint
line a lot mote frequently. Although we'll give up a lot more
points, we’ll also be scoring a lot more points.”

Coach Arssneault said he expects th squad to average about
125 points per game. “it's going to be way faster than what it's
been through the Keith eta," he said.

Though this strategy will increase scoring and give the Plot
nests an edge early, it is difficult to tell how these Changes will
affect the Pioneers at the end of games. “Hopefully we can den
cidc games sooner. We're better suited for the first 38 minutes,"
said Point Guard Arseneault. “But [without a big man] we're
not as well suited for the final two minutes."

Under these fast-paced conditions, this year may prove n:-
cord-brealting. By averaging 37.6 points per game, Guard John
Grotbetg’OQ can become the all time scoring leader for NCAA
Dmsion 111, while Grotbcrg, Arsenault, and Bobby Long '09
have a chance to become the onl trio in NCAA history to
combine for 5,000 career points. ‘This group is putting set-
ting records and having fun at the forcfront,”Coach Arseneault

like I do."

While the five seniors should see a large share of the play-

Long before the men's basketball team hits the hardwood
this weekend, Head Coach David Arsencault must take on
one of his most difﬁcult tasks of the year—ﬁlling his non—con—
ference schedule. “I made 110 calls for seven noneconferenee
games," Arscncault said. “We just don't allow [opponents] to
prepare for confercnce play because we don't run a set offense."

As the lore of”The system" grows, the number of coaches
willing to face it keeps dropping. Without quality teams plays
ing Grinnell before conference play, the team is less prepared
to face conference foes such as Lawrence. Grinnell's chaotic of»
fense forces opponents to do three key thingp make layups,
break the press with quick passes, and run the floor far more
than they would in a normal game. Teams are forced to change
their offense, take on a completely different mindset on de-
fense, and do not see this style of play again
all year.

“We have some teams in our lea ue that
are more athletic, more disciplined,o r]l)et-
ter in transition," said Mike DeGeotge} head
coach at Cornell College and former assistant
to Arscncault at Grinnell. “We don't ever face
anything like Grinnell."

DcGeorge’s team last played the Pio—
neers to open the 2005 season,and the teams
haven't played since. He said that he would
consider taking on Grinnell again, but only
on a few dates around the end of the year.
where a matchup could get his team back into shape before the
January slate ofconferencc games.

Greg GoLton, head Coach at Loras college in Dubuque,
was even more blunt. “I don't think that style ofplay is real base
ketball," he said. “More importantly, it does nothing to prepare
us for conference play Non-conference is for preparing you
foL conference play, Nothing else.“

Such opposition makes it almost impossible for Grinnell to
play natural rivals within the state—Like Loras and Cornell—
that the Giinncll women's [Cam plays frcqucntly. While Arscr
neault can often adjust the teams and keep the nonrconference
schedule strong, he admits that " this year's schedule is maybe an
outlier." Iowa has nine Division 111 teams and 13 NAIATeams
(a division ofsniall schools that can give athletic scholarships),
but none are on Grinnell's schedule.

In fact, Arsencault has given up on trying to play most
iii—state schools. “We've gotten to the point where I see

”I made 7 70 (all; forsel/en non—
tanferenfe games, weft/it don’t
allow [opponents] to prepare for
tanferenfe play betause we don’t
run a let offense.”

Head Coach David Arseneault

[coaches] at recruiting events, and they just don't mnt to do
it,” he said.

All other games are guaranteed conference opponents. but
even those relationships are tenuous. “If you ask conference
gays whether they would want us offthe schedule, they’d prob—
ably tell you yes," Arsencault said. “They're making their views
loud and clear. "

The scheduling fracas means that Grinnell's first slate of
games this your can best be described thh one word: “Who?"

Friday’s opener brings Bible Baptist College to town, a
school of 541 students in Springﬁeld, Mo. that chlds just ﬁve
valsity sports. If that doesn't scream “great matchup,” then Sat-
urday’s game against 340rstudent Manhattan Christian Colt
legc ofManhattan, Kans. might not are you up, either.

Tuesday's game against tiny Vennard College ofUniversity
Park, Iowa would have been similar.
But we’ll never know, as its president
announced on Nov 12 that due to finaii»
cial difficulties, the school would close
at the end of the semester and cancel all
athletic events. The game will not be
made up and Grinnell has not replaced
them on the schedule, preventing us
from enjoying the bizarre matchup of
the billion-dollar endowment versus
the school with, well, no endowment.

Such is the world of Grinnell base
ketball.

All three schools are members ofthe NCCAA, a small con-
sortium of Christian Bible Colleges that have traditionally not
given Giinnell much competition. Last year,NCCAA member
North Central University was the opponent for David Arse»
neault ‘s ’09 NCAA record (SJ-assist performance.

“To have to play some of these bible schools, it's not pm’
ferred,"Ai‘seneault said, “For one, if we arc going to be a let
gitimate threat at the Division 111 level, you need quality wins
over Division 111 opponents."

The Pioneers will see one noneconference challenge later
this year, taking on a Wheaton team on Jan.3 that is ranked
third in the d3hoops.com preseason poll. But only two other
DIII teams are on the nonsconferencc schedule. Arsencault
saLd next year’s schedule is tougher. but the scheduling woes
will likely remain, reinforcing the fact that outside the Grinnell
bubble, be it basketball or otherwise, the world is a far different
place.
