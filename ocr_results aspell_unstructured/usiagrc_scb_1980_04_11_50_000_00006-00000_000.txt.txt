Call to college
writers

lroni Coiiegroie Hedlines Services

Student writers from across the
country can contribute to a book on
what they all know best—college.

Contributions to The College Primer
are now being sought by Brown U.
students who began the project a year
ago to produce an honest account of
what college is like.

The Brown U. students decided to
open the book up to students from
other schools to provide a more
universal perspective and are now
seeking essays from any students on
any single aspect of university lire.

Editing is already under way for the
200 pages of manuscript produced by
Brown students in a course they
created and for which they obtained
credit. The book is organized
alphabetically, so ”A” is for Anorexia
and Anammy lab, “B” is for Boredom
and Beauty, “c" is for Cheating and
Creativity, etc.

Further information is available
from Debi Helligman (Box 1469,
Brown 0., Providence, RI, 02912), or
Andrea Arany (67 George St., Pro»
videnee, RI, 02906). Entries should be
received by Heiligman by May 15.
