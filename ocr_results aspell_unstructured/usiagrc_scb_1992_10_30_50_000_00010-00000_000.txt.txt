Vote for the future

P‘I N’I

Elect Clinton/Gore

George Bush has spent the past
decade making the case for Bill
Clinton’s election to the Presidency
this year. After his 1980 transforma-
tion intoaReagan toady,GeorgeBush
moved through eight years ofa lack—
luster vice presidency in a criminal
administration to his anointrnent as
the voodoo master of a failed eco-
nomic theory which died alongside
communismThis failedtheorywhich
has pushed our economy and the na—
tional infrastructure to the brink of
complete niin while piling up a mas-
sive debt under the weight of which
we might very well spend the next
century suffering.

UnlikerrgeBush, BillClinton
has fresh ideas and a vision for the
future ofthis nation. While Bush has
divided government and made ex-
cusestothepeople,Clinton hasshown
the rare ability actually to lead gov;
emmentandconneetwithpeople. He
has demonstrated this potential in his
six terms as Arkansas’ governor and
throughouthis brilliantelection carn-
paign this year. This countIy is des-
perately hurting for leadership and
action, and President Bush has made
it clear that he will provide neither.
President Clinton will.

President Clinton will offer pro-
grams that will createjobs, make af-
fordable health care available even to
the poorest of Americans, and
strengthen our national investrnentin

the education of our people. He will
implement initiatives to put our
economyon apeacertimc footing and
make our nation competitive in the
global economy. He Will strengthen
environmental legislation, civil rights
legislation and make sound appointr
mentstohiscabinetand to theeourts.
He will cut the federal bureaucracy
and see to it that our tax dollars are
spentin away thatbencfits us all. He
Will put compassion and love for the
people back into the White House.
Bush will do none of this.
Thisyeartheeconomylikelywill
be the single biggest criterion upon
whichvotersmaketheirdeeision,but
we submit that—even disregarding
completely this important issueilo
return a Republican to the White
House this year would be unconscio—
nable and terribly grievous in its rev
percussions for the nation and it‘s
people for another reason. George
Bush has turned his national party
over to a faction which does not have
in mind the interests of the American
people, who are not interested in no
my and )USLICC for all, and who will
subvert constitutional government in
this republic if given the chance.
Republican National Committee
Chairman Rich Bond has told us that
if we do not agree with their ideas
then we are not good Americans. The
sentiment was echoed in varying de-
grees at the Houston convention by

8&3 deplores anti-free
speech action in P0

The Scarlet &Block deplores tlieactionsand attitudes of whomever was
responsible for stealing from the college post office most of the print-run of
the Grinnell Spectator, copies of the American Conservative and various
items placed in the post ofﬁce by the College Republicans, including anti-
ERA leaﬂets.

When one is confronted with an unpalatable opinion, the proper course
of action is to respond in an intelligent manner in a comparable medium, and
not to attempt to stiﬂe the other point of View, People who wish to restrict
free speech andprevent dialogue are dangerous todemoeracy no matterfrom
what end of the political spectrum they hail, and they should be exposed for
what they are: censors and thoughtpolice. These actions are injurious to the
community, they prevent people from having access to materials to which
they have a right of access, and it will not stand. It harms every group on
campus and every member of the community. and we will fight it. We doubt
anyone would get very far trying to steal this paper from the post office.

In spite of our political differences with the Grinnell Spectator and the
College Republicans (or perhaps precisely because of them), the Scarlet &
Black stands unyieldingly with them in assening and defending thcabsolute
right to absolute freedom of speech.

PatBuelianan,PatRobertson,Marilyn
Quayle, Barbara Bush and others.

A huge electoral mandate for
Clinton nextTuesdaywouldsignal to
the “Party of God” a strong repudia-
tion ofhaleful and undemocratic iin-
pulses in American government and
politics, and it would clear the way
for a reclamation of the Republican
Party by its moderate majority, We
have an opportunity next week to
demonstrate with our votes that we
do not accept control of a national
political party, our government and
our courts by people such as those
who now control Republican plate
form-making. Ifwe fail to send this
message, then our government and
politics, our law and our society will
turn uglier and more dmgerous. Our
freedoms will be destroyed, and, for
many of us, our very lives Will be put
in danger.

Americans have a heavy respon-
sibility on Tuesday, and those of us
who still believe in our country and
thatdocument which begins “We the
People...” hope that you Will make
the only possible sensible choice:

VoteClinton/Gore,forachange.
Vote Clinton/Gore for the future of
America.

This and the other political enr
doriemertt: that follow reﬂect the
opinion of a majority of this
newspaper's editorial board, based
on a ballot token Monday.

lightfoot no, Baxter now

Reasons to elect Elaine Baxter to represent this district in the United
States House of Representatives:

She cares about public education and the well»being ofour children.
She understands and is concerned about Iowa farming issues. She is
concerned about the health ofthc cnvtronincnt and about the infrastruc—
ture ofthc economically depressed southern partof Iowa. She wants to
actively work to help the economy ofihis area and she thinks it‘s a great
place to live, work and raise children. She is pro-choice, she supports the
Iowa Equal Rights Amendment, and she IS not, unlike her opponent, a
spokesperson for the religious right. And she’s notiim Ross Lightfoot.

Let‘s say a loud “no” to Lightfoot next week and send Baxter to
Washington to work for Iowa and Iowans.

ERA: VOTE YES

Despite the guarantees contained in the Constitution of the United
States an in state constitutions it has been proven necessary again and
again to fight for separate legislation l0 guarantee equality to groups
which should have that guarantee regardless and Without argument.
Racial minorities, gays and women (together, most of this nation's
people)havehadtofightforthereeognitionofrightsthatshouldbetheir’s
under the Constitution. We deplore this situation, and for this reason we
call for all Iowans to say a resounding “yes” the Iowa Equal Rights
Amendment. Ifattitutlcs will not change, then We Will have to secure
basic rights through new laws. It‘s been too long.

Additionally, this newspaper deplores the shameful tactics of
fearmongering, hatred anti bigotry employed by the opponents of the
ERA to win their desperate, eontempiible fight. Pat Robertson, Phyllis
Schafiy and the Stop ERA radicals have lied to Iowans about the agenda
behind the ERA and attempted to itislill fear and loathing with a public
relations campaign designed to tap into that which is most base and
disgusting in the human character. In theirdesperauon to win, they have
subjected gays to attack when they have nothing to do with this issue, and
they have slanderod whole groups of people.

We hope that lowans will be smart enough to see through the smoke
on election day. Say “yes” to the ERA and a loud “no" to the Schlaﬂy/
Robenson gang.

 

 

 

Think again about Grassley

while we concede that Chuck
Grasslcy's return to the United States
Senate is all but a fail accompli, and
while we must confess that a ringing
endorsement of Jean Lloyd-Jones at
this pointmightfalllikeaflatnoteof
futility, we still ask that voters to
carefully weigh some facts before
sending Grassley back to Washing
ton for six more years.

Grassley, a public relations masA
tcr, has done a remarkable job of
cultivating an image of being a mav-
erick, independent, family farmer
senator, relatively non-partisan and
always ready to stand up to his party
leadership and his President in favor
orowans' interests (to wit, his oppo-
sition to the GulfWar,one of the few
real examples of this maverick trait).

The iacts are somewhat differ
ent. While he is certainly no Jesse
Helms or Orrin Hatch, he does qui-
etly hold social views not too far
removed from those of that far right
crowd. He advocates the Constitu-
tional amendment to ban abortions
and, while taking no public position
on the Iowa Equal Rights Amend-
ment, he has taken campaign contri-
butions from its opponents.

Grassley has also skillfully misr
represented, with his current TV ad
blitz,hislegislativeaccomplishmenls.
Whilchcclaimsgteatsuccessinfighlr
ing for pro-ethanol legislation which

would benefit Iowa corn producers,
he actually voted against an ethanol
bill in 1990 which would have re—
quired oxygenated fuelsin 101 cities.
He did this after taking $150,000 in
contributions from oilcompanies,artd
he admitted on the Senate floor that
his decision was made in deference to
theoilinterest. Thelegislation thathe
did sign onto at the last minute, and
which he now touts as a great victory
for Iowa farmers, is nothing more
than a scaled down sellrout to oil.

In 1990, he voted against Circle
ofPoison legislation out ofdeference
to chemical companies and their
$100,000 contribution. This legislar
tion would have kept dangerous pesV
ticides off imported foods and lev-
elcd the competitive playing field for
Iowa’s farmers.

Also during the 1990 Farm Bill
debate, he battled to stop research
into sustainable agriculture, again in
deference to the chemical companies.

District 58:

And this is “the only farmer in the
Senate?” The traditional approachto
farm policy which the Senator advo-
cates has been driving Iowa's farmers
into bankruptcy.

State Senator Jean Lloyd Jones
advocates research into sustainable
agriculture. We believe that Lloyd-
Jones would do a better and more
honestjob ofrepresenung Iowa farm
interests in the Senate. As an advo-
cate of reproductive freedom and
EqualRightsAmendment.shewould
be the better choice to serve Iowa
women’s interests, Her advocacy of
mass transit and defense conversion
indicates a vision of a better fulure,

While it mightseem desperateat
this point, and while Grasslcy is ad
mittedlyverypopularamonglowans,
we would like to paraphrase Bill
Clinton’s exhortaiion to Orange
County,Califomiavoters: Hold your
nose and vote fora Democrat. You‘ll
like what you get.

Back Black

State Representative Dennis Black has represented Iowa House District

#58 outstandingly well.

He knows the people of this district and he

undersrands their concerns. The needs and problems of District 358’s
residents are his, too, and he can be counted on to do whatever he possible
can to help his constituents when representing them in Des Moincs, His deep
concern overjobs, education and the environment are highly commendable.
It would be a shame not to re-elect Dennis Black next week.
