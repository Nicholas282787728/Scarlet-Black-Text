1952 conference meet. The Carts,

line plunge early in the first quarter, but the play was called

nell Homecoming crowd last Saturday.

In Tossup Battle

the Carleton Carls at Northfleld

The Pioneers will enter the
game with hopes oi improving
their 2—2 conference record and
thereby tighten their grip on
fifth place in the Midwest can»
erence. However should Carts
ton win tomorrow’s game they
will move into undisputed pos—
session of fifth place.

The Carls aren't as weak
as their 2-4 record indicates
They were beaten by Law—
rence, st. Olaf and Monmouth
all first division teams and
by Knox, while knocking off
Cornell in their season‘s open—
er and taking Ripon 14—7 last
Saturday. Grinnell edged
Knox M to end a ten game
losing streak on Oct. 3.

The Carls have a strong,
well—balanced .offense, but their
attack has been hampered by a
leaky defense. Leading Carle-

i ton’s offense is quarterback
Walt Varco, who was shifted
from halfback a week ago

against Ripon and proved him-
self one of the finest passers in
ithe conference. Don Voss, a
pile-driving fullback, paces the

JCarls’ running attack.

Coach John Ptitsch has drop-
ped tackle George Baker from
the Grinnell squad for the rest
of the season in accordance
,wlth a doctor’s recommendation.
Baker had been plagued by a
series of brain concussions and
therefore had seen limited ac-

tlon thls year.
Aside from the loss Bi Ba-

ker,, the entire Pioneer team
is in top physical condition.

Grinnell’s mental outlook is
also vastly improved, partially
due to last Saturday’s Victory.
According to Pfitscll a win
this week would snap the de-
featist attitude which has
troubled the Pioneers during
the past two seasons.

This game could go either
way, but if the Pioneers are to
win they will at least have to
duplicate last week’s perform—
ance, which was Grinnell’s best
showing of the year. Compared
with the immediate and recent
history of Grinnell football this
season probably can be regarded
as a successful year, especially
if the Pioneers win tomorrow.
