Coke contract

I also like consumerchoiee. But I rind rhe uproar over rhe

For example, i remember rrying io ﬁnd any vending ma»

choice?"

Squares Oreo-kay by me

Last semester, I studied abroad, so my roommates
and I had to cook our own mealsi After months of
consumption of meal after meal of chickpeas, lentils,
peanut butter, or some terrifying combination of the
three, we longed for Grinnell dining halls and, natu-
rally, oreo cream piei Thus, one can only imagine the
excitement that surged through me 1 saw it on the
menu a few weeks ago. When the duad employee
brought out a new tray oforeo cream pie slices (I knew
when he brought out oreo cream pie, because he was
attacked by a pack ofstudents turned ravenous-dogs...
you know what I’m talking about), I fought off the
masses to get a slice But something was different.
rho oreo cream pic was no longer in convenient tri-
angle-shaped pieces Now it was square. My world was
in shambles. But] took a piece of square pie anywayil

tasted it. It was yummy. Again, my world made sense

Winter not so bad

Okay, so this is a bitch of a winter. But instead of _

complaining about it like I was planning to. here’s a
tribute to some of the things that make it almost
worthwhile. First, there's the sheer novelty of ﬁnding
my car completely covered by one huge ice sheet
Then, there’s the nice guy in the pickup truck who
helped me push said carout ofits parking space, Lucky
charms and cranberry tea at Cowles can make just
about anything worthwhile. And ﬁnally, how about a
hand for those people who make me feel like it’s spnng
already? in talking about Bob rlindcrs and Justin
Dieter, the guys who walk around in the snow wearing
shorts. You guys rock.

Town relations

The scene: a quiet Saturday night, Hy»Veea A group
of college students are attempting to purchase alco—
hol illegally. rhe clerk doesn't like the LD. given. she
calls the manager. who disappears with the LD. and
calls the cops. Cops arrive and depart with crinnell
student with the LD. Let's call her Johnny. The cops
haul her "downtown", advise heito ﬁnd an actual 21»
yeareold to buy her alcohol next time, and ticket her,
because Hy»Vee rou: THEM To. The cops don‘t care,
don't want to ticket the student. Hy-Vee does. Hy»Vee
hates college students, and doesn‘t want their busi—
ness. Well, ﬁne, hy-Vee isn't gonna get our business.
Thanks a lot, jackasses.
