DRUMS ALONG THE DANUBE
(A GUEST EDITORIAL BY L. WENDELL HAYES)

The long expected has happened. Though newspaper
headlines scream at us, they should not surprise us. Three'
Weeks ago it seemed that Chancellor Schuschnigg had. gong
completely over to the Nazis, and that Austria had become
the puppet and stooge of Germany. But Schuschnigg evi—
dently complied only in part with Nazi demands

That which happened yesterday and today is that which
was expected three weeks ago. Austria is now outwardly
and inwardly Nazi. This more or less absorption of Austria
by Germany had been foreseen by many observers for 19
years. Many foreigners, who have favored such a union.
regret that it had to come about under Nazi auspices.

What about the repercussions? England and France
have shown their official and unoffi a1 displeasure. They
could not, however, prevent what has happened without the
actual use of force, without war. They have temporized so
long that their gestures mean little. In recent months these
countries have acquired a keen hind-sight, A little fore
sight after the war would have saved them the agony of
this hour. The utter foolishness of trying to freeze a status
quo is nowhere more evident than in Europe. And unfor—
tunately for the League of Nations, it has been in its
political efforts more or less nothing but the tool of those
who would prolong the status quo into eternity. ,

As for Italy, it can thanli its lucky stars that its Ethi-
opian efforts preceded the German absorption of Austria,
because this bringing of German might to the Brenner
Pass will soon mean that Italian eyes must be focused on
the protection of northern Italy.

Adventures abroad can only be made witll the goofl will
of Germany. If it is asked why Italy (lid not protest and
act against this Nazil‘ication of Austria, one must answer
that Mussolini is the realist par excellence. He saw the
handwriting on the wall and know that Italian opposition
could ollly irritate Germany and perhaps delay the event
tempera 'iy, but could not prevent it,

In regard to Czechoslovakia no doubt changes will also
take place there. How far reaching; they will be, no one
knou , Whether those changes will lead to war, no olle
knous. There is a strong wind blowing from the north and
from the west. When the headlines announce such changes,
do not be surprised. They are coming.

It is only conjecture to state how far the United States
is directly or indirectly responsible for what is happening
and what has happened since the war. We know that it
was the hope of Woodrow Wilson that an American policy
of approximate free trade, together with our participation
in the L agile would reduce or even obliterate the economic
and poll cal inequities of the peace treaties. Perhaps that
would have happened, but it is almost equally probable
that we would have been used to perpetuate a status one,
rather than to change it.

Most Americans feel that Europe has a long way to go
ill settling its own disputes before America \\0uld care to
commit itself to any system of general securi . We may

 

be short sighted, but we are not the only short sighted]

nation. A general system of international organization is
urgently desirable and is probably bound to come, but only
a poet or a prophet can folctcll its form or its hour.

The wheels of history turn slowly, but they show the
foolishness oi" perpetuating stotus—quos, and any system
based ill theoly or in fact on such a perpetuation will be
bound to fail.

TNTERPRETED BY

John Spaulding

vah —Gormnny inst night
moved to extend her control over
all Austria by obtaining the res-
ignation of Chancellor Schuss
nigg, reorganizing the cabinet
with Arthur Seysz»!nquart, a
personal friend of Hitler, as chan—
cellor, and moving German troops
over the border at three points.

The move which startled all
Europe was provoked by Schuss-
nigg's call for a plebiscite to have
been held tomo--ow on the ques-
tion or Austrian independence.

Radio bulletins this morning inv
dicated that Hitler will himself go
to Austria today to take charge
of the situation. in England the
cabinet postponed action in lieu
of further information but offir
cial circles agreed that England
faces a deﬁnite decision between
peace and war. France, still in
the throes of forming a cabinet,
heard Leon Blum plead tor sup»
port or his efforts to organize a.
government which could act in
the present crisis.

In the opinion of Dr. Walter M,
Kotschuig, the German move
means the end of Austria as a
national entity. The danger now,
in his opinion, shared by the lead-
ing observers in Europe, is to
Czechoslovakian indepen d e n c e.
The pertinent question now is
how long the nations of Europe
will pursue policies similar to the
”realistic" one of Britain which
seems to have been dealt a death
blow by the Week's events,

side of the international balance
sheet, however, was the signing
Monday of a reciprocal trade
agreement between Czechoslar
vahia and the United States.

Aside from the more immedi.
ate benefits to farms which will
come as a. result of the lowering
of restrictions on agricultural
products, this new agreement, any
other in a long series made in
the last few years, will have a
far reaching effect in promoting
better relations, both economic
and political, between the na-
tions of the world.
