Senior Colloquium

The senior colloquim will come
up for consideration at a me
ing of the educational policies
committee November 27, Dean
Earl D. Strong said Wednesday.

Mr. strong told a reporter that
thc colloquim was adopted three
or four years ago but because
of the war was never defined or
really put into efféct. According
to the college bulletin of 1942-
1943. the senior colloquium was
designed to occupy the free
fourth of the senior's time and to
integrate the work of the four
years.

The purpose of the coming
meeting is to find means by
which the Colloquium may be put
into more effective operation,
