First-years ought to f It big shoes

Application pool increases, Admission numbers stay small

Bl Davm NATHAN
CO-NCWS Editor

Grinnell's most selective admissions year
has resulted in a class that is brighter, but not
necessarily richer than the classes before it.
according to Vince Cuseo, Grinnell's Direct
tor of Admissions,

"This year's class is better academically
better in terms of tlle standardized measure
lnents that schools use, such as SAT scores,"
said Cuseo.This year‘s incoming class scored,
an avenige ot'rour points lughcr on their com
posite SAT scores than last years fit-5t yearsand
66% tanked in the top ten percent of their high
school class,le from 62.9% for lasr year‘s class

“What was different this year was that we
had a much smaller target number for the
incoming Class. We needed a larger Class last
yeaer it came in even larger than expected.
By doing so, we were even a little more se-
lective in the number of students we ac
cepted tilis year, compared to the year be-
fore last. which was our most selective year
up to that point; said Crisco.

The admission department received up-

wards 20,000 inquiries last year and obminerl
2,800 applications While ofﬁcial numbers
Won't be taken until the Will day of class,
there are 380 new students at Grinnell, in
cluding 5 exchange students,23 transfers and
352 first years as of this Writing, For Conl-
pai-Ison,there were 414 new students last year.

According to Cuseo,"You could say that
this was a good admissions year by the stan-
dard indices."

In terms of class composition. this years
incoming students are identical to the rest of
Grinncll campus Over 11% of the new stI|~
dents this year are domestic students of color
and 8% or them are international students. In-
cluding transfer and exchange students, this
year‘s class matches the 21% population of
international and domestic students of color
composition Grinnell had last year,

In order to build and maintain a diverse
community in the middle of Iowa, the
Grinncll admissions department looks at de-
mographic data bought from other sollrces,
such as the College Board.

Using Search software, Grinnell Admis-
sions is able to efﬁciently locate schools with
students that Grillnell Would like to recruit,
”We look forstudcnts who Would be academi-
cally qualiﬁed for Grinnell," said Cuseo,“and

“This was a good

also take a look at scllools that have sentlls
students in the past and the schools of'stut

Geographically, this years class represents
slightly IewerU s Slales than last year's. First
years hail from to staies:last years came forth

from all 50. Unlike many universities and IV
League schools, Grinnell does not set a cap
on the number ofstudents it will accept from
any particular region of the country In this
year's incoming class 01'380 students, 311
high schools are represented No region or
the country dominates Grinnell‘s student
body or makeup

About 50 Iowans were accepted to
Grinnell this year, a number that translates
into about 15% of the total class into the fresh
man class, making up about 15% of the of
this years freshmen class hails from Grinnell's
home state dominate region of the country,
strident body wise. Even from Grinnell's
home state of Iowa, only 54 students, about
15% of the total class population, was ac-
cepted

“We don’t do anything to manipulate ad-
missions m any way," said Cuseo “The appli-
cant pool ls already diverse enough so there
is no point in the admissions process where
we have to say, ‘gosh, maybe we shouldn’t
have accepted that laststudent from theTWin
Cities because there is going to be an over

abundance of students from there . The pool
is large enough that it keeps the admtssmns
process pretty pure.

In the ftlture,Cuseo believes an single "‘31"
keting strategy would be helpful for the ad
missions department “We need an organized
Way to talk about Grinncll and tell the storl
or Grinnell," he said "We're in a period oi tran
sition and I think its transition in a good way
but I think its time to talk about what doc
something like the Fund for ExceLletlce mean
for a school like Grinncll7 How can we talk
about all the good things going on at Grintlcll
in a way that's cohesive and integratctlso that
the alumni office and the development office
are ringing in the same things as the admis-
sions ofﬁce. Some sort of over reaching mar
