Virginia Read: Varsity club tickets
are a good idea, but I think it's
rather embarrassing for girls to have
to ask fellows for dates.

Lee Alexander: Certainlyl I do not
think that the Varsity club was by

Don Fessler: Yes, I should be much

the Varsity club idea.

Elizabeth Barnes Varsity club
tickets are a grand idea. It's fun to
turn things around once in a while
and let the girls ask for the dates.

Robert Swift: Yes, for the first
semester, anyway. There aren't
enough dances in the second semes-
ter to make it pay unless the price
of tickets is lowered,
