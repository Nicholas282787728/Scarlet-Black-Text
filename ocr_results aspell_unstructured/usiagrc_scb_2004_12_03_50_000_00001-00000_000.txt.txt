more than $150,000 in
legal fees, and still got
a Super WaltMart."

"'1 don't expect a new
Super Wal-Mart to hurt
me directly, in terms of
lost competition. But

I do think it will affect
the people I depend on
for business."

into a small town,
they‘re going to take a
big hunk out of the re—

the retail pie is virtually

The City of Grinnell looks set to llpprove the
annexation of property south of town that, if devel—
oped, could include a Super WaltMart. This issue
was debated at a City Council meeting on Nov 30.
at which many citizens spoke out against the pros
pact of an expanded wnl-Mart in Grinncll.

The issue concerns farmland owned by the Re-
naud family, located south oftown across Highway
146 from the current Wal-Mart.The Renaud family
has voluntarily requested that the city annex their
land,with the purpose ofselling it to Magnum De—
vclopment Corp. Magnum and Wal-Mnrt have held
discussions about the possibility ofbuilding a Super
WalsMnrt there.

The Planning and Zoning Committee initially
recommended that the city not annex the property.
On Nov. 30, the city council votcd to send the issue
back to the Planning and Zoning Committee for
furthcr review, but council member Byron Worley
said that annexation was all but inevitable.

Because the annexation was requested volun-
tarily by the Renaud family with the intention of
selling it to a dcvclopcr, dcnying the request witlmut
a valid reason related to environmental concerns or
inadequate access to public utilities would invite a
“loss of income" lawsuit that VVorley characterized
as “very nasty and quickly lost" for the city.

Many members ofthc Grinnell community have
expressed concern about the prospect ofan expand
ed Wll’MlKl’ and the effect it would have on exist-
ing businesses.

Mart. “I’m not sure we want to be part ofthnt world,”
he said. Citizens such as Cooper have organized
meetings in opposition to the annexation, and spoke
at the Nov. 30 mecrlng against it. Cooper urged that
the annexation either be tabled or sent back to the
Planning and Zoning Committee, in order to allow
for a community impact study.

Council members and citizens who had come
to speak against WalsMart generally welcomed the
prospect ofa study of the economic effects ora su-
per Wal-Mart on Grinnell. Council members raised
questions over how such a study would be paid for at a
time when the city is currently laying orfworkers. Ac
cording to Cooper, "the usual Way is for the developer
to fund the study in one way, shape,or forin,”with the
study administered by the city.

Not everyone was opposed to the idea of an ex-
panded WalsMnrt. Jerilyn chaud, part of the Ron
and family seeking annexation, spoke at the meeting
about her sadness about people doing their shopping
at larger Wal-Malts in Newton or Marshalltown in-
stead of in Grinncll. While she claimed to “probably
hatc WaltMart more than nnyonc" at the meeting,
Renaud said that she wanted tax dollars that Grinncl—
lians spend at Will—Mart going to Grinncll schools.

Council member Worlcy said an expandcd Wal-
Mart would be a major economic boon to u city the
size of Grinnell. “On the other hand," he added,
“wal-Mart is traditionally a category-killer. If they
have, say, a bike section, and there's a bike store in
town, rhcn their goal is to drive the bike store out or
business. It's their corporate model."

If a WaltMatt was built, Worlcy continued, local

Alexander, Frey and her family were driving back to
Preys house in Elko, Minnesota after going out to

black ice and lost control of the car. According to the
police reporr cited in the Star Trilimz, the car hit a
guard rail and then rolled over.

Alexander and Frey's father, Stephen trey, were
killed in the accident. Frey, her mother Patricia Frey

originally in the Intensive Care Unit but by Tuesday,
she was considered stable and was soon allowed to
have visitors. Several of Frey’s friends drove to Min—
nesota to visit her. Frey's mother had surgery at the
hospital that Saturday night.

Alexander coordinated Dag House last year and
was involved in Dagohir. “He loved Dag," said Ana

one ofour lenders and he really embraced that role."

Alexander was also involved in SGA. He reprca
scntcd offtcampus college-owned housing as a Senat

Alexander was very interested in music. He played

resources offered by the college, such as unlimited
walk»in counseling and eight free visits to the merit

town, as they cope
with Alexander’s
death. Student Afr

offer more wellness

Crrdy strcsscd
the need for stut
dents to express their feelings. “I think it’s really imt
porrant to keep talking and to seek out fricnds and
family," he said. “Let's keep talking and not bottle
[feelings] up." According to Crady, representatives
of the college will be attending Alexander's funeral,
The funeral is being held on Saturday, Dec. 4 at the
