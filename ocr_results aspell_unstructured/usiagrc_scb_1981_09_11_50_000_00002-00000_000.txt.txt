Health Center under new direction

Griswold assumes supervisor post,- Bailey stays on as staff nurse

by Marilyn Clark

Over the summer a student and iaculty
search committee was lor-med to interview
and to select a replacement ior irma E.
Hall, the iormer administrative supervisor
oi the Health Center, in the early part oi
August the committee chose Andrea
Griswold, R.N,, 3.5 , as the new director oi
the Health Center. -

Hall submitted her resignation to Jim
Tedennan. vice-president and dean oi Stu-
dent Aiiairs, last April 29. lt became eﬂ'eo
tive June 1, Hall lirst came to Grinnell in
1956 as a stall nurse. she became head
nurse in 1963 andassumedher linal position
in 1967, completing 25 years on the center's
staii.

Hall's resignation came as no surprise,
however, to the administration, When asks
ed last spring by the 8&8 about her reasons
ior quitting, Hall said, “I'm tired, I'm
weary.” Yet she added that she was not

planning to remain in Grinnell but wanted
to travel.

In this case when the
walls come down it's
nothing to worry about,
but just a natural part of
setting up the college's

The resignation prompted the iormation
ol a search committee which included
Tederman, Waldo Walker, executive vice»
president oi the college, Flossie Mitchell,
associate dean oi student allairs and two
students, Dana Webb and Cindy Buhse.

Prior to me actual selection process,
however, a consultant from the iowa School ,
of Nursing had been hired to assist In ﬁle

that the next director hold at least a bane

received approximately 15 applications but
only two came lrom qualiiied people

This qualilication thus eliminated Donna

she was not considered by the committee as
a viable candidate.

Webb said, “i do not know ii Donna
Bailey applied ior the job. We reviewed two
applications. One was irom Griswold, the
other irom a person who lived in Des
Moines. We were impressed with Andrea
because oi her oualiiications and her ideas
about the Health Center's function,"

when asked about the change in staii,
Donna Bailey said. "I ieel Andrea and I
have a good working relationship. 1 think
the Health Center is on the upswing and i
hope students continue to use its services "

As the new director Griswold holds the
required baccalaureate of nursing degree
which requires tour to live years oi train
ing. Her past experience includes two years
or public health service in Colorado, two
years oi home health nursing in Lincoln,

Nebraska and tour years oi community
health work.

Although Griswold was reluctant to
outline all oi her goals and plans tor the
center beiore she has the opportunity to
present them to the administration, she did
state one oi her iirst goals: “to provide
more screening procedures ior students,
i.e., throat cultures and iniectious mono
tests." she iurther stated that “me center
will continue to supply overrthetourlter
drugs to students.‘

Griswold does not plan any major
changes tor the center at this time
Moreover, the Health Center will remain on
campus despite the controversy last
semester over the possible move oi health
services to Grinnell General Hospital.

In the iuture, Griswold would like to
write a health column ior students on such
topics as preventative health measures and
"what students would like to learn about
health,"

Gale observatory
campaign underway

New facility and telescope to
provide research opportunities

by Beth Vilen

The Grinnell College Development otiice
will begin a fundraising campaign in late
October ior the construction oi a new obserr
vatory and purchase oi a telescope The
observatory will be built primarily to honor
Grant Gale, professor emeritus oi physics
and curator oi the Physics Historical
Museum. The new lacility will also provide
research and observation opportunities
presently unavailable to the college coma
munity.

According to Jack Robertson, associate
director oi Grants Program at the Develop
ment otiice, Gale is a "Grlnnell
institution" well known ior his “success as
a teacher" and his “personal interest in
students." Among the highlights oi Gale's
service to Grinnell are 43 years oi teaching
physics and the development oi the Physics
Museum.

Robertson stated the observatory will be
an appropriate tribute to Gale because it
will be both a “Visible" and an “enduring"
structure. The observatory will cost ap
proximately $200,000 to $400,000 and Cone

struction is expected to begin next sum-
mer. Though the telescope will probably be
ordered in late December, it may not are
rive until next iall Robertson claimed the
observatory will be a “ﬁrst class" facility,

Robert Cadmus, assistant protessor of
physics and an astronomer, described the
telescope as a reﬂector telescope with an
aperture between 20 and 24 inches, lixed on
a very sturdy and precise mounting The
telescope will be able to support heavy ins
struments and be controlled by computers
The specific design of the building and
make oi the instrument will be decided cola
lectively by members ol the physics
department and the college administration
This decision may also be inlluenced by the
amount oi iunds available

According to Robertson, the Gale cam-
paign will be selectivein order not to “come

pete with the other needs oi the college such
as Burling Library renovation." No money
currently belonging to the endowment will
be appropriated lor the project. A general
appeal will be made in the Grinnell

Magay‘ne if the appeal is cleared with Lin-
da Rabben, editor or that publication
Pledges will be accepted for three years
and solicited trom three sources. First, let
ters irom the chairpersontsi tnot yet
designated) will be sentto all physics alum»
ni Second, members oi the Development
otiice will telephone or visit approximately
so oi Gale's personal iriends, Third, dona-
tions irom iaculty, students or anyone
wishing to honor Gale will be encouraged.

Once built, Cadmus claimed, the obser-
vatory will iunction “primarily tor the
beneiit oi Grinnell College students."
Though the lacility will be used lor iaculty
research, Cadmus said its main impor.
tance will be to provide a lacility tor “real
research” in order to enhance the “intellecr
tual development” oi all users. Users will
include any interested students or Grinnell

residents as well as physics majors,
physics students and astronomy classes, in
addition to visual observation, the obser
vatory will be used tor photography,
photoelectric photometry (brightness
measurementst, spectroscopy
tmeasurements oi the temperatures. com.
positions and velocities oi stars), in-
strumentation development and other pra~
jects. Cadmus emphasized that the obser
vatory will be a “College facility," not one
intended exclusively lor use by the physics
department,

Though the Gale campaign is still in its
early stages, both Cadmus and Robertson
expressed optimism about both its success
as a tribute to Gale and its potential tor
future Grinnell students. What does Gale
have to say about all this? Just one thing:
“Ask me alter it's built.”
