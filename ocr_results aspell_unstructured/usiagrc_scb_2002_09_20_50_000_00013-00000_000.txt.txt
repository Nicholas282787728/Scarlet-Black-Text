OCCO
changes

guest column st

it is mildly amusing to me rhar rhe campus is
only now widely aware of rhe upcoming elosure of
occo houses, rhanks to rhe will. The lack orin.
tcresr by rhe campus population ro keep up.ro.dare
wirh regards to rhe campus Masrer Plan and ongoe
ing changes suggests somerhing is lacking in terms
of our own responsibiliry wirh self-governance. i
would suggor, however, rhar rhe problem is more
serious than rhe Sept. 15 occo housing article
suggests.

What the article failed ro poinr our is rhar in
addition to German House, two orrlie orher houses
scheduled for dosure are also language houses China
House and' Russian House. Language houses are
being preserved, bur one must ask rhe question not
how rhar will occur.

It will not rake a mans wizard to realize rhar of
rhe seven remaining occo houses, ar lasr five must
be language houses. spanish and French will remain
where they are, bur China, German, and Russian
will move inro where projecr houses, such as “An
House". currently reside.

Thar leaves only rwo remaining houses for
proyecrs or common rnreresr living. Since 1 do not
foresee “Music House" ever losing irs srarus, rhe an
nual applicarions for occo housing, which can
exceed 20 applirations if last year was any India»
rion. will now compete for the one available hous:,

steve iarson is also wrong regarding his com.
ments on occo houses. While the decision to pull
occo houses is nor new, the plan in reduce rhe
number ofocco housing is.

When i arrived on ermpus two years ago i an
rended a mecring wirh the archireers. stegman and
Associates, regarding upcoming changes ro rhe cam.
pus. occo housing was alieadyslared ro be elimi.
nared, and re be replaced by an aparrmenr opposite
ofwhere East campus nowsio. Paul Ford, as occo
senaror, mmpaigned wirh orhers for rhe building of
occo house replacemenrs . rhe “rour Zéeberl
(mvnhomes” rhe article icfers ro that will no longer
be builr.

in addition so being relatively closer to campus,
occo houses are part ofrlae school computer ner.
work sysrem, provided with college custodial sewites,
and are paid for as parr ofrhe housing cost. Further.
more, occo housing provide rhe opportuniryfor
closer, righr.knir communities to form. There are
benefirs to occo houses rhar are not being dis.
cussed, and diey provide opportuniries rharolfcam.
pus non.eollege owned housing does not

As far as i know, Grinnell is die only rollege where
housing like occo extends beyond ,usr language
houses. Some may disagree, bur arremprs ro save
occo housing we lvcllrfounded rwo years ago and
in my view still quite valid today. i hoped that in
some way the article was partly inspired beeausei
attempted to make this an issue in my failed biel to
become occo senator.

Like most orher campus issues, mere is usually a
lor oreomplaining and protesting but lirrle aerion.
The rrurh is there isn't much inreresr in worklng ro
defend housing opportunities and campus issues.
Few realire (here are no cornpurerlabs on East Cam.
pus, and even fewer care rhar Bob‘s was unable ro
run in rhe black insread, srudeno weakly protest,
throw money into the problem without solving rhe
cause, or more likely, whine, in the last [W0 years of
warehing these problem. SGA has done hole as ads
dress such problems,

Although some or us have been trying to invoke
changes, via rhe Campus Computing committee
or through attempts at SGA political organization
aerion (nicknamed “Blue-Green" initiative), with
our orher people’s involvemenr or even supporr nodie
ing will occur. Although rhere's plenty orsupposed
“initiative" by studenrs when it comes to protests
such as rhe “Radical Srudenes Collective" going on
aboiir antiwar during rhe sepr, ll memorial, is rbere
rhar much supporr here ar home ro improve siudenr
life or our own lnicrcsn?

Like an osrrieh, l id srucls in the mud and ass
in rhe an- is how id . liegoriae rhe siiuarion.
