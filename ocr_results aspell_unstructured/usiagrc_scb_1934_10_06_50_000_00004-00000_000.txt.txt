Haskell Holds Large Edge
Over Jay Elevens

OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 4. tspcc1alis
If a preponderance of victories in a
series mean anything the Haskell In—

nual tangle at the Eluejay stadium
Saturday night.

The slippery braves hold an a to 3
advantage in ivins in n rivaliy that
has existed since 1913 with only a low
in uptions. Blueiay fans are look-
ing forward to the renewal ofhostllllil»
tiles. The beating of the tom—toms and
the rcdskms' complete mastery of the
art at dcccption have combined to
make this yearly battle a favorite.

We begin with the right

mellow them like rare wines
