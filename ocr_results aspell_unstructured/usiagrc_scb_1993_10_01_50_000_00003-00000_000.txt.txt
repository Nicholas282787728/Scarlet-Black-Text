A Grinneil Student's Barn

”What the hell are you doing up at this God-awful hour?” I had assumed

she was headed to bed after partying all night I explm'notl tliatl was going

out to the barn to dochores. For a chuckle. I added that I was running about an hour
and a half late.

“ng what what~are you on drugs'I", was her reply.

I do not expect anyone who does not love farming or the Iowa countryside to
understand why I get up early each morning to go out to the barn. My friends here
just grin atmewhcn I try locxplain. Buteveryonc here atGrinnell knows the intense
concentration which our studies require, and We all have ways ol taking a break.
Some of us party, some exercise sports, some play musiml instruments—the

My family’s barn was built this sumtncr on a small acreage on the west edge
oftown. It is Small compared to most barns around here, but large enough to house
our three mares: Dolly, Sandy. and Raisin Those horses require a lot of care: they
must be fed and given \valer several times a (lay, and always “C(Xl to be cleaned up

cap, and squint outmthc horizon. I tune in country music on the radio and find the
perfect soundtrack for my trip.

When t get to the edge of town, I start passing farmers in pickup trucks who

and look out at the fields or wave at whoever is driving by.

Mom usually gets out to the barn around 7:45 am. She fills me in on
the town gossip and lets me know what the family has been up to. If we
finish chores early enough, we head over to the diner for breakfast. My

Is Grafﬁti Harassment?

By Sarah Cornell

Ehaveeslablishedthatlhe
frrstament‘lmentdoesnot
include the right to har

rass fellow students in open, face to
face situations, but what about the
right to express offensive, even hater
fuI opinions on restroom walls?

In Dibble Hall, a few weeks ago,
an SA hung a shoot of paper on each
bathroom wallforallthoseimportant
notions that occur to people when
they‘re in the restroom. But when a
comment that could be taken as sex-
ist appeared on one, she exchanged
the papers to show the men what the
women wrote and vice versa. Then a
serious issue erupted: one woman
harl commented on a man’s body,
and another had added something
ltke“don'twe Wish they were all that.
way!“ Some of the men were of
fended. One in particular wrote an
anonymous letter to the rest of his
hall explaining why he took offense.
Although the actual letter and the
sheets have been disposed of already,
[was told that he found the women’s
comment on men was hypocritical
and a form of sexism, and that he
asked why women would objectify

men when they had fought for so long
to stop men from doing the same
thing.

What had starttxi as a simple
comment and aJoke became a serir
ousrliscussionof sexism for that floor.
The SA that first put the paper on the
walls now says thatshets“very sorry
tfsomeone felt harassed” and that it
isimporlantthatpeople feelcomfort—
able discussing these issues as they
arise.

Women realize much more of-
ten than men do when they are being
objectrﬁed, because women have
been campaigning againstsexual har
rassment. Men should be just as
aware when they may be sexually
harassed, because situations like the
one in Dibble do arise and may help
both men and women understand how
something that is “just a joke" can
affect the subject of that joke, male or
female, heterosexual or homosexual.

Graffiti can be so much more
than a joke, so much more than even
the source of a good discussion. In
the restrooms at the Burling Library.
where the walls are meant to be used
for expression, there have been com-
ments like “all gays must die.“ “stay
