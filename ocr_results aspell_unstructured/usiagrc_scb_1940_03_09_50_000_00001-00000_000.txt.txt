Dr. Hans Kohn Points to Different Types of Imperialism
Motivating Germany and Great Britain in Present Conflic!

 

By Norma Rose Myers.

“We are facing one of the great
decisive turmoils through wltichl
history passes," declared Dr.
Hans Kohn, professor of history
at Smith college, in the last of
his series of talks given in Her-
rick ehapel Wednesday night.

During the period 1759 to 1815.
fear and uncertainty prevailed,
and there was no peace whatso-
over. At present, we are passing
through a hard period, also; and
Dr, Kohn expressed his belief
that we will go through more
wars and upheavals than people
imagine in the next few years.

“If there is any hope, it is that
mankind will learn to bear the
truth and face the issues," he
said. “This war cannot end in a
compromise. It must end in a vic-
tory for one side or the other;

but 1 am in 0 way certain which
side will win ' he added.

This is a war between imper»
iahsts, Dr. Kohn pointed out. but
it is based on entirely different
ideas of whst imperialism is.
England’s idea is to preserve the
British empire, While Germany's
idea is to build up a Gannon em
pii-e.

Americans do not live up to
their own democracy, their aims
and ideals, nor do the English,
according to Dr. Kuhn. Liberty s
growing in the British Empire;
and if and when India gets her
liberty. it will be because she was
educated in freedom by the Eng-
lish, Since the world war. the
British Empire has grown into a
commonwealth of all nations, and
most of these nations are not
possessed by England at all. but

. are independent.

German imperialism is differ-'
ent. because Gennan imperialists
do not believe in liberty. They
are teaching obedience and au-
thority; and therefore they cannot
build an empire like the British
have, Dr. Kohn asserted.

“The .Nazis treated the Jews
as they did because they were
helpless, and the Poles and
Czechs were treated so for the
some reason,” he declared. High-
er education, even high school ed-
ucation, has been taken away
from the Poles in the attempt to
degrade them for use as laborers.
Hitler only a year ago declared
his friendliness for the Poles, but
as soon as he found that they
were helpless, he turned on them.
