College

would host
hundreds in

evacuation

by Eric Green

in 1931, a directive by President Reagan
on Crisis Relocation Planning brought
about the advent of a renewed civil defense
effort. The new plan, with its emphasis on
detense in case or a nuclear war, worries
many people who ieel it signiiies a will
ingness by the administration to accept the
threat of nuclear war.

Eldon Hedrick, the Civil Defense Com»
missioner ior Poweshlek County,
downplays the importance oi the new
crisis plan. He stresses the importance or
readiness, saying, “We need to have a
good plan, implement the plan. . , and to
educate the people." Contrary to critics ot
the plan, Hedrick claimed there were no
problems in complying with the new
policy.

The plan desrgnates Poweshiek County
as a host area for Linn County which in-
cludes Cedar Rapids, This means that,
assuming adequate warning is given, the
residents at Cedar Rapids would evacuate
their city and travel (by automobile) to
Poweshiek. The town of Grinnell is ex
pected to absorb about 6,000 people.

Grinnell, as a low population host area,
is not expected to sustain a direct attack.
For this reason, the town has no official
fallout shelters (with food, water and first
aid supplies tor two weeks). Instead,
shelters and housing for the guests are one
and the same.

A number of buildings on Campus would
house guests. A smaller dormitory like
James Hall would house 113 people, Norris
403 people and Fine Arts 1,411 people.

The Scarlet and Black tried to obtain in-
lormation on the college‘s deiense plans.
Director of the Phystcal Plant Dale Hawn
was not in town and no one on campus, in-
cluding the administration. had any
knowledge of what the college would do in
the event of an attack,

Questions remain though, as to whether
anythlng can lessen the tragic conse-
quences of a nuclear war

To begin with, Iowa. despite its sparse
population, is not immune to attack: its
larger cities are probably targets. A
Defense Department study in 1979 showed
ll that a limited nuclear war is highly
unlikely, and 27 that the Soviet Union. dis-

KDIC renovations
should help image

by Scott Sutherland
KDIC, the voice of Grinnell ‘lrom high
atop Darby Gymnasiumt' will soon

, become ‘the voice oi Grinnell and surrounr

ding communities from deep in the bowels
of the Forum' if current plans for renovar
tion are implemented on schedule.

A Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) law requires that improvements on
the station be made Within 16 months
lollowing the approval or the station's
upgrading proposal. Fcc approval oi the
plan could come as soon as midsMay 1983,
and construction could take place between
September 1988 and July 1984.

KDIC is tentatively slated to occupy
space at the north end or the Forum base»
ment in what is now the Negative Space
Gallery and the Student Activities Room
All April 25 meeting that included KDIC
Station Manager Chris Erlel, Dean of StuV
dent Aflairs James Tederman and
members of the Forum staff could not
reach a decision on the exact Iocatloti
which KDIC should occupy in the Forum.

Ertel was optimistic, though, and said.
"They were very encouraging and responr
sive to the idea of locating the station in the
Forum basement as soon as possrble."
Ertel stressed that KDIC'S new location
must lit into the college’s entire renovation
plan, which includes moving the admis»
sions office into Mears Hall and devoting
the entire Forum basement to student
organizations.

The new studio would encompass more
square feet than the studio in Darby and
would include rooms for interviewing and
recording. *

Ertel will appear beiore the trustees on
May a to present his budget proposal or ape
proximately $25,000 to cover the costs oi
new equipment and installation. Virtually
all existing equipment will be replaced

KDIC plans to purchase a used 1000 watt
transmitter for about 82000 rather than a
new 100 watt unit with a $12,000 price tag.
The new transmitter and the antenna will
remain at Darby while the rest of the
equipment will be housed in the Forum,

KDIC‘s switch irom a small, very per-
sonal and very relaxed collegeroriented
station to a larger, more poweriul and
more “public" station raises questions as
to the quality and content that KDIC's new
programming should rerlect Ertel was
confident that the station would retain
most or its to watt personality and that the
questions surrounding KDIC's upgrading
would be answered favorably and in their

 

own time. p

“We‘ll never be a professional station,
but i don't think that's desirable anyway,"
Satd Ertelt “Our aim is not to imitate Come
mercial stations'but to let the students
decide for themselves what kind of pro
gramming they want. I don't see bad pro
gramming as much a catastrophe as an in
sult to the intelligence of our listeners. The
programming should retlect the contem-
porary tastes and values oi ’he students."

Ertel acknowledged that some programs
ming may have to be toned down but not
necessarily scrapped He added that cer-
tain campus happenings, like particulars
on the escort service or all-campus parties
would no longer be broadcast.

Ertel is convinced that KDIC's renova-
tion will thwart what he perceives as “a
growing decay" that aitlicts the station.
Ertelcited the poor condition at equipment
and the ongoing depletion oi the record
lihrary due to theft as two primary causes
0! the station's decline,

“it's hard to get people motivated to put
on a good program when they have to work
in those kinds of conditions," Ertel said
“lf KDIC were left the way it is it would
die It would get so out 0t touch with the
school that in five years it would be
pathetic "

if KDlC were to increase its power to 419
watts, Ertel said, record dealers would be
more apt to send the station albums than if
they remained at 10 watts, Ertel believes
the combination at more and better
albums and a newer, more lunctional ens
Vironment tor the station will halt the
decay and change the way students View
KDICi

”KDIC is an important outlet for stur
dent's creative urges and impulses," Ertel
said, "I think that if you put students in
there with good equipment and a good sup-
ply oi records that something very in»
teresting will happen."

Ertel stressed that the rejuvenation 0f
KDIC lies not only in the improvement oi
equipment and record supply but also in
the way that the DJs regard the station.
"The station's iii-st responsibility is to its
Dds,” Ertel said. "i think that the station
should create a good atmosphere tor its
DJs.

"A better atmosphere at the station and
among the students who work at the star
tion would lead to a better feeling on the
part of the student body towards Knlt'.“

Films .
committee
falls

by Jane Kaufman

Proposal of a bylaw establishing a films
committee failed at Wednesday night's
.loint Board meeting.

Pete Hautzinger, Haines Hall peesideiit,
explained that alter selecting Daid Hath
man and Daniel Meltzer as co—chairs, he
had gained insight on the workings of the
committee.

“I voted for this last week, and I'm not
going to vote for it this week. Basically i
don't think that the committee should
make the final decision," Hautzinger said.

Offrcampus Non-college Owned Housing
Representative Eric Secoy stated, "I think
that the beneﬁts of diversity will compenr
sate tor problems. . . i think they'll get cone
sensus."

Mike German, off-campus college-
owned representative, proposed two
amendmenB: 1) that the films chair
choose films prior to {all break. iThe com-
mittee as a whole would choose ﬁlms for
the rest of the year.) 2) that the bylaw
would be enacted in the 1984435 school
year.

Peder Fretheim, Loose Hall president.
supported Gorman. "I think that the iirst
amendment is very practical." He spoke
of the reduction of long distance telephone
calls over the summer lot which such an
amendment would provide.

Films Chairperson, Ruth Katz explair‘w
ed, "The iilms are basically the last thing
put on the calendar. . . Fairly lengthy
rescheduling is gone through about three
times. i think it would be a big problem to
decide who's film would be scrapped," She
also expressed reservations about the eftlr
ciency oi groups in such decisions.

Gorman then withdrew his amendment
Bethe Keegan, Clark president, asserted.
“i think that the idea of a committee to
help with promotions and publicity is a
good one‘, but I disagree with the idea of a
committee making final deciswns "

SGA Vice President Mark Bradshaw
closed debate, and the bylaw failed,

After a brief discussion, a bylaw
establishing a concerts committee and
chair with singular power in the selection
or concerts was passed tor the second
time. making it a part of the SGA constitu-
tion,

The fall budget for the 198384 fall
semester was tabled alter analysis,

Fi‘etheiin inquired, “Did the Scarlet :iilil
Black submit an itemized budget“ '
Treasurer Vern Juel reported that the}

Kelly replied, "The majority of their are
penses are in the printing. office experts

this year they are coming out behind "

Fretheiln explained his reason for ask-
ing the questions in past years Joint
Board had been told that unless their
budget was increased, a smaller paper
would be printed, He expressed reserva~
tions about approvtng increases for a
media organization, “especially one that
has such little student interest."
