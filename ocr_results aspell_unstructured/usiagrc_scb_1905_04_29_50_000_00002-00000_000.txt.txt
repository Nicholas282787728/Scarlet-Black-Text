(ﬁbitoriul

, good many coinpiaints'have been
[a heardthe past ireelr regarding
the strict rules wirioli lime been put
in force in the new library. We do
not believe that the students were
justiﬁed in this and that they were
laboring nntler ialse impressions 1n
the lirstpiauethe library is intended
for a room to study in and in order to
do this elieetively, itinrist nece . ily
be quiet. it has become anotoiioiis
fact that that during the past winter
the greater number or students
visited the old library ior the express
purpose or visiting: or making a date,
and or course incidentally to study.
It. was almost impossible to study and
with the crowded conditions, the
librarian was unable to preserve order.
As to the matter ol’ requisitions roi-
every book removed ircm the shelves,
we would not wonder but it was done
asarriatteroi‘ last resort, in order to
preserve the library to prosterity,
Students have shown utterly no re-
gard ior the rules anti a large number
of boolrs have been lost under the old
system. it may have been ainutter
oi tllouglltlesslless but college stu-
dents ought to be or an age where they
could reeogiriie the rights oi others.
. Taken as a whole we do not believe
tlrat the new rules will work hardy
ships and that in the end all will be
henelited thereby Tire library may lose
its popularity as a Visiting resort, but
it will inll‘rll its purpose as a study
room correspondingly better.

TENNIS TOURNAMENT FRIDAY.

The tennis season has opened again
and a large bunch oi players have re-
ported for practice. The courts are
in good shape and the indoor practice
this year has resulted in giving the
players exceptionally good torm ior
so early in the season.

The varsity team will probably be
A. A. Blatllerwluk and R M. \Vesl,
since these two men lime played to-
gather lllSL'year and are Showlng goarl
