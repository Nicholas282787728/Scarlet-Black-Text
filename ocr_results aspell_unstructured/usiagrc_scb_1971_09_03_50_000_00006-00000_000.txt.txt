Peru Dismiss:
Grinnell Role

by Donna Brooks

Richard Feral, the Spanish
department’s new member,
will apply his speciality in La-
tin American history, litera-
ture, and politics to teaching
one segment of the dcpﬂrtr
ment's tetally revised curri—
culum.

The purpose of the new cour»
ses in the Spanish department
is to offer a more complete
approach to the study of a
geographical area (Spain and
Latin America), rather than
to limit the study to a Silk
gle discipline. This semesr
ter Mr. Fera's courses are
taught in English so that stu-
dents in any department may
satisfy their interests in that
area though they have little
or no knowledge of the lan~
guage.

In his freshman tutorial "Re-
volution and Counterrevt)’
lution in Latin America,"
Fera hopes that his students
will gain an understanding of
what social revolution really
means in Latin American
countries and enable the slu*
dent to differentiate from the
remanticized conception of
revolution prevalent among
some in the U.S. .
Latin American History to
1325, taught by Mr. Fera
also, will cover Spain’s pro-
blems as an overextended
power with a tradition of
conquest, often in the name of
Giristianity. Usingatopical
rather than a chronological
approach, Fera will not spend
much time on the conquest it-
self, but will emphasize eco
nomic, moral and religious
concerns of the empire and
their effects on land and la

bor.
Latin Ameriwn MindandSo-

ciety, another new offering in
the Spanish department, will
explore the individual minds
and their relationship to La-
tin American society. For me
ample, one of the books used
in the course is a social pror
test novel of the thirties, m.
dieting the latifundia and the

Mr. Fera chats with the S & B.

exploitation of the Indian in
Ecuador.

According to Fera, theseand
other changes in the Spanish
department also reflect the
trends in the approach to the
study of language. Years ago
the accepted method of lanr
guage teachingwasthatofgrar
mmar and translation. This
method taught the student to
read and write, but not ne-
cessarily to speak.

The reaction to the grar
mmar-translation approach
was the audioningual apprOr
ach, which taught students to
speak, but neglected writing.
The dialogues tended to be
simplistic and uninteresting,
thus turning students off to
language learning.

The Spanish department now
tries to combine both of the
former approaches to [Sadr
ing, and toprovide substantive
and conceptual material in its
language courses while cons
tinuing to develop in its cou-
rses a literary orientation.

Mr. Fera has been a stu-
dent of Latin American stu-
dies for eight years, with inr
terests in political science,
language, literature and his~
tory. Presently Fera is work
ing on his Ph. D. in lberoV
Amerimn Studies at the Unir
versity of New Mexico. He
has also resided in Chile and

Revolving Door Spins Tonight

A Grinnell student'walking
around South Campus at 4:00
A.M. Saturday may seea light
in the basement ofMears Hall.
No, it's not another party;
it's the Revolving Door. The
Revolving Door, a non-profit,
student-staffed corporation
plans to open Friday night.
Two staff members will be

there from 7 o’clock Friday
evening until 7 o‘clock Saturr

day morning to discuss per
sonal problems,helpwlthdrug
hassles, give abortion or birth
control counseling, or just rap
with anyone about anything.
The Revolving Door first
Went into operation in Decem‘
ber, 1970.

The college administration
has no direct ties with the
Revolving Door and the Re
volving Door is in no way

responsible to theadministra-
tion. The staff offers crisis

counseling on a short term
basis to students withany kind
of problems they feel that
they would like to discusswith
someone. Confidentiality is
guaranteed and thosewho wish
to call and talk but remain
anonymous are encouraged to
do so. Besides the two staff
members who remain at the
Revolving Door to accept vie
sitors and phone calls, there
are students who go out on

Call.

If anyone is interested in
using the services of the Re-
volving Door, he can call exr
tension 601 or 602, or Visit
the office in Mears basement.
For those interested in be
coming staff members, trair
ning sessions are scheduled
to start later in the semester.

Potmah Romnnbersmi-‘isil
Ho Surprises 0r Expectations

by Laura Snook

Many Grinnell students have
come long distances to study
amongst the cornfields, but
perhaps Patmah Hassan came
the farthest.

A Malaysian from Penang,
Wellesley Province, Patmah
spent three years at Grinnell,
and three summers at the U.
of W. Illinois. She graduated
as an economics major in
1971. She intends to start
working on her MA. in Bu-
siness Administration this
month at the University of
Iowa and is staying with Chris
Neilson‘s family in the in~
terim.

The Malaysian government
sponsored Patmah's U.S. edu—
wtion through a training pror
grom in economics. She chose
to study in the midwest in

order to have easy access to
both coasts for travel pur-
poses, and applied to Grinnell
through Don Liggett.

“I didn't come to Grinnell
only to study, but rather to
meet people and acquire an
understanding ofthe American
way of life," says Patmah.
“I was ready to expect any-
thing, so nothing really sure
prised me.” in fact, Patmah
expected Grinnell to be more
violently revolutionary than
she found it.

Because she spent her sumr
mers in school and her other
vacations travelling, Patmah
has not been home to Malay-
sia since her arrival in 1967.
She hopes to do so neXt sum»
mer, perhaps to spread good
Propaganda about our beloved
campus in the midwest. ‘

Students Study lake In "Reckless” Proiect

by Anne Walter

If you had spent a bit of
time at Rock Creek Lake,
the closest swimmingand boar
ting area to Grinnell this sum-
mer, you would have been
stopped at the entrances or
approached on the beach Just
as you had gotten comfortable
on your towel by some ra-
ther questionable lookingpecr
ple with questionaires that
asked everything from your
recreational habits toyourinr
come. If you were either es
pecially lucky or especially
observant you would have no»
ticed some seedyrlookingkids
doing funny antics out in a
canoenperhaps pouringwater
through a cloth funnel or in'
tently studying an instrument
face.

All of this was only members
Of the Rock CreEk Lake Enr
vironmental Studies (R CLES-
pronounced “Reckless") pror
ject out on data—collecting exV
peditions. ROLES was a stu-
dentroriginated interdiscipli-
nary project, financed by one
of approximately a hundred
National Science Foundation
grants that were awarded to
groups of undergraduate stu-
dents studying different as
pects of local pollution prob
lems. Late last fall, Anthony
Wheeler, a Grinnell student,
began organizing RCLES, as
a study of local recreational
lakes to include the chemical,
biological, anthropological
and economic conditions of
the lake.

Several students were subsee
quently chosen to work on the
project and began exploring
the procedures for studying
water quality in a man‘made
recreational lake in an agri-
cultural watershed. The cher

Grinnell's BIGGEST
little shop just crammed
with interest

mistry section measured nur
trient levels and other para‘
meters that are necessary for
evaluating the biological phe~
nomena in Rock Creek Lake
and its major tributary, Rock
Creek. The biology section
planned to look at such things
as bacterial and alyl levels
as well as bottom fauna, root
ted plants and fish. In addi—
tion, a sediment study was
done by the biology and che-
mistry sections, to determine
the amount and kinds of sedir
ment particles entering and
being trapped in Rock Creek
Lake. The anthropology group
concentrated on determining
valuesrrpcople's attitudes to-
wards recreation and various
“pollution" conditions. The
economics section collected
data for a cost-benefit analr
ysis, which will determine how
much money is needed in what
areas to achieve or maintain
a given water quality level.
Naturally, at the beginning
of the study the problems
were not welltdefined. For-
tunately guidance from people
who work in the fields of age
riculture, water quality and
agricultural pollution was av-
ailable to the project.

The focus of the project
changed when it was decided
that silt, not excessive algal
growth, is the most dama-

ging factor at Rock Creek
Lake. Silt is carried with
runroff from agricultural
lands in huge quantities and
can be controlled by emplo»
ying various landmanagement
techniques. It is a major cone
tributor to the turbidity or
murkiness of the water, com~
plicates algal and fish pro;
duction, and settles out in
a lake, thus contributing to
sediments and filling the lake.
In spite of these and ump~
teen other difficulties, the
project can be called a suc—
cess, at least from the cone
sideration that 15 very naive
students really bemme in~
volved in a study that is unr
usual at Grinnell, since it
involved extensive practical
application of the students'
knowledge. A preliminary a.
valuation suggests that the
work done’ has some validity
and that the studies were at
least in the right direction.
This semester three students
will continue the project. They
will be completing the
evaluation and preparing the
final report to be submitted
to NSF. By that time over
a year will have been put
into RCLES and the further
research problems will have
been defined, so that the pro-
ject has the potential of con-
tinuing.
