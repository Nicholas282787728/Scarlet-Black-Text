The sensitive approach

In April, 1968. Students for a Democratic Society placed over 2000
white crosses on Central Campus to protest the Vietnam War. Inscribed
on the crosses were the names of Glinnell senior men, faculty members
eligible for the draft and reserve officer training corps instructors. This
quietprolest symbolized antivwar (speciﬁcally. anti-draft) sentimentsand
was directed toward a marine recruiter who spoke on campus that day.

Yesterday, members of the Persian Gulf Alert and other interested
students placed approximately 73 paper tombstones on Central Campus.
This protest had a slightly different messagkto show support for the
troops while expressing disagreement with the policies behind the War.

Both symbolic demonstrations are examples of silent protest, a form of

free speech guaranteed by the Con-
STAE E

stitution. But there are differences
E D ITO RIAL

between the two situations that
should beconsidered. According to
Prof, Al Jones and former college
PresidentGlcn Leggett,the national
and campusatmosphcres during Vietnam weremore emotionallystrained;
there was a grcalerovcrall antirwar feeling. According to Leggett, “Itwas
scary...you got the feeling the place wasJust going to explode."

Now, in the face of the Persian Gulf War, similar silent protests have
begun. But the mood of the campus and the tone of the protests have
changed. No longer are we a campus almost totally united in an anti-war
stance.Now, protesters support the troops while arguing against the
ideology behind the war. Perhaps if a draft is actually implemented, this
new mood will change.

Until then, the Scarlet andBlack will not takea stand on the War. We
believe in the expression of one‘ views, whether that expression take the
form of Ox ford-style debate. letters to President Bush, green ribbons, or
the Day of Silence.

However, the installation of tombstones, similar to the placement of
crosses, is insensitive to members of the campus community who have i

, loved ones in the Gulf , These individuals already must accept the
possibility of death. Although this protest represents PGA‘s legitimate
right to freedom of expression, perhaps alternative methods could have
been used to raise awareness of the War, One cannot always shape onc's
conduct to suit the wishes ofall individuals, but potential death is notjust
another issue. It may be closer than we think.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Protest disregards
friends, relatives

To the editor,

We are writing in regards to the
Persian Gulf Alert’s use of tomb-
stones to makeapolitical statement
about the war in the Persian Gulf.
This is an emotional ploy to gain
support for their cause. But these
emotions are not PGA's; they are
ours, the family and friends of the
troops stationed in tthulf. We are
the ones who need the least re-
minder about the realities of war.
All we have to do is close our eyes
to seethe images they are trying to
create. We live each day trying to
overcome these images in order to
simply function,

are using tombstones on order to
bring home the fact that people are
dying and are going to die in this
war. Dothcyreally thinkthatpeople
are not only too aware of that fact?
And if they do believe this, could
they not find a way to show this
reality that is not excruciatingly
painful for those of us who fear
seeing the names of our loved ones
on those tombstones? We are the
ones who most want to see them
come home soon and alive.

Students criticize
PGA‘ insensitivity

To the editor,

We feel obliged to respond to
some of the actions already taken
by P.G.A and others in the near
future.

We cry. A fiance, a brother, and
some very good friends are cur
rentlydeployedin tthersian Gulf,
and most of our waking moments
are clouded by the fear that these
loved ones might return home only
fortheirown funerals. Lifein Grin-
nell is intenseenough. . .livingwith
the tragedy ofwur does not make it
any easier, People have the right to
protest.

We do not and would not deny
them that right. But tombstones?
What does this accomplish except
to deepen our anguish? We spend
ourdays in turmoil, thoughtsof our
loved ones and theirfaleconstantty
weighs on our troubled minds. To
force further pain upon us is unnccA
essary and unwelcome. We ask for
your understanding, your respect.
and your compassion. One day we
might receive a knock on ourdoor
and ﬁnd ourselves standing in front
of a real tombstone.

Finding a
balance

. I To the editor,

I have to protestlast week‘sclaim
that this was the “long awaited Har-
ris debut" for the New Duncan lm-
perials. Iwas not waiting. Nor was I
waiting last year for De La Soul. Or
the year before for Timbuk 3. In-
stead, I wait for the Concerts Come
mittcc to bring one band to this
campus that I would truly enjoy
seeing.

Regardless of the 14k that was
spent on the Indigo Girls and the
effects of such a huge expenditure
on other possibilities, I am also
dumbfounded at the amount of times
some bands are playing on this came
pus. This will be the lmperials‘ sec-
ond concert here in a year. aHouse
of Large Sizes will be playing here
for the third time in two years, and ‘
Soul Asylum played here for the
second time in two years.

What kind ofvariety is this’.7 The
members of the Concerts Commit-
tee must realize that they have some
responsibility toail the students, not
just themselves and their friends. I
have sadly accepted that in the four
years I will be here it is very un-
likelythata metal band willplay tltis
campus. However, I fail to see Why
my parents have to pay inordinate
amounts of money to bring in bands
I have no desire to hearjust because
I don’t like what the rest of the
campus does Grinnell emphasizes
diversity in the experiences it offers
its students, and the Concerts Com-
mittee should be no different.

Students respond to criticisms.
of Farrakhan speaker

To the editor, ‘

We’re responding to articles
commentingon tthationof Islam.
First of all, what does anti-Semitic
mean? According to Webster's
Dictionary, Semitic pertains to
“comprising of subfamily of the
Afro~AsiaLic family of languages
including Arabic, Hebrew,
Ethiopic. Amharic and Aramaic.“
In other words, Semitics are those
who speak indigenous African lane
guuges. So if one can reasonably
assume that ifthe inventors of the
language are African, then those
speaking the language should
probably be African in descent.
right?

Well, if we calculate correctly.
Semitic should be another word
meaning African because Semites
are a group ofAfricans who speak
Semitic languages that originated
in Northern Africa.
I-lmmm..wellifourcalculalionsare

either Africans or Erotha Zanllir
