The dean of womeirs ofﬁce
continues its campaign for de-
cency. But we have small doubt
that the truth is great and will
prevail. and that one of these
days an ingenuous young man is
going to find out how to open
the quaint devices on the light
switches.

Or perhaps the powers that be
will follow the suggestion of a
houseinother across the campus
and turn them out for five min—
utes each night. There‘s got to
be a safety-valve somewhere.

Does third tloor Hajnes serve

Th little squirt from the Uncle

opinion that Spence should have
been on the diaper line along
with Livermore and Weatherson.

Betty Closz’ conduct reminds
us of Stoops old story about the
female roomer at his house who
was quite frank about the reason
she was in college. The acquisi-
tive feminine nature hasn’t
changed since the cave woman.

on Use of Finger

At Dinner, ‘Cocktails, Not
Honored Guest Should
Be Served FirstY

By John Marion

Did you know that when you
are served a finger bowl heiore
dessert you are to wait until you
have eaten said dessert before
using said finger bowl?

No?

Well. neither did the members
of the men’s orientation class.
Many of them thought the finger
bowl should he used as soon as it
is served

Papers Graded.

All this came to light in an-
swers on an examination on eti-
quette given members of the
class Thursday. Nov. 30. The
papers were graded
week by Richard Pooicy. assist-
ant to Shelton L. Beatty. deanot
men.

Practically every member
the class has been well trained by
uppeiclassmen regarding the
pouring of water. the test showed.
When asked how they would seat
guests for a formal dinner, they
all placed thcmselves “on the
water” pitcher.

Bcatty Foiled.

Another question about formal
dinners asked who should be
served first. (Dean Beatty hoped
the boys would answer this one
correctly and say. as any gentle—
man should. the honored guest.)
Nearly all the boys. however. an.
swered this by saying. “At a for-
mal dinner. cocktails should be
served first."

Highest score made in the exe

sible 100. according to Pooley.
Men ranking among the first

programs of the Science club. due
cording to Donald Fort. president
of the group.

Dr. W. c. Oelke. instructor in
chemistry. spoke at the Deceme

Complete ‘servicing" of For ,

.A college graduate. like other
products of this machine age,
gets considerable wear and tear.
and Fordham proposes to guar-
antee its graduates on a replace-
ment basis.

I Industry can send graduates
back to Fordham for more sea-
soning if any weakness develops.
The new placement bureau is the
result at a year's survey among
leading employers and interviews
‘with 92.000 students.

“No manuracturer would think
of selling a 37.000 airplane. an»
tomobile or any other product
without complete servicing to
the client." said Rev. Robert L
Cannon. president.

“We in education\are making
a mistake today. It costs from
$4.000 to $7,000 to turn out fin—
ished products. We get a job for
our product and forget him.”
