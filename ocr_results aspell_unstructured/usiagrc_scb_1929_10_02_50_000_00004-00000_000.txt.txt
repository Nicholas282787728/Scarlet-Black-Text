floors. The building is considered
one of the finest and most modern in
Chicago.

During the summer Mr. Gard was
sent by the Daily News on a six—day
:‘ooat trip on the Great lakes in order
’to gather material for a series of six
signed articles on Great Lakes com—
merce. A feature in the mid—week

‘Wooden Men" also appeared after
this Great Lakes trip which Mr.
«Gard took from Indiana Harbor to
Superior and back.

The author from his experiences
gives in this story an exact descrip—
tion of the life of the lake seamen
today as compared with those who
money forty years ago. Mr. Gard
‘mskes the statement that the hazing
'of seamen has passed out with the
sails but occasionally even now a
skipper will send a new man for a

referring to the Geneva conference
which he attended this summer. He
went on to say that it was so differ-
