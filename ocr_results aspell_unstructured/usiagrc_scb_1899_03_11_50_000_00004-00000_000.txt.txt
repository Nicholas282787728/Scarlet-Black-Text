National Track Meet,

Caspar Whitney. the authority
on alnatculism and purity in col»
lcgc athletics, has a plan by which
he hopes to bring together the
eastern and western colleges. His
idea is to hold, evcry two years.
a national track meet to decide
|llC championship of the United
States. The association having
charge of this meet shall be gov»
erned by representative College
men. Under this plan it is hoped
that the \vranglcs and squabblcs
now so conspicuous on both of
the intercollegiate associations.
will be of lcssimportance. Mr.
Whitney favors holding the meet
in Chicago. as it is the most ccn-
‘trally located city.—U.af1l’1.Dni1;l/.
