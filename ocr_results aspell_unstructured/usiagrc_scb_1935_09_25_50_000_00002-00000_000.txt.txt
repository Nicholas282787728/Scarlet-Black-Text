Students Need
New Attitudes
Steiner Believes

‘lAt the opening of the school
year both students and faculty
must develop new attitudes and
new ways of thinking,” declared
Dr. Edward A. Steiner, professor
of Applied Christianity, at the first
Vespers of the year last Sunday.
His topic was “The Academic New
Year."

Dr. Steiner went on to say that
new students must become accus»
tomcd to being “little frogs," and
may have to suffer for righteous-
ness' sake. He praised the groupl
of new students, and brought to
their attention the fine group of
leaders in the upper classes,
The speaker stated that not only
must new students learn, but they
must unleain as well. Under a
good faculty whose goal is tmth,
they will learn to face situations
without disturbance. Though it
may be hard to change opinions,
Dr. Steiner pointed out, it will be

good for tlicm to occupy new per
sitions.

“In cultivating inner lite, Grine
nell strcsscs goodness, truth and
beauty, as taught in Vespers," ex-
plained Din Steiner,
