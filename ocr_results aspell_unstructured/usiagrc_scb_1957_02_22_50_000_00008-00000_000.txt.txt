outcome.

Unfortunately, all fourth
hour projects are quite de-
manding. Because it becomes
mandatory to take these pro-
jects in ones major, where it
is assumed one ought to get
his best grades, the 4-3 pro—
gram becomes prohibitive tor
majors who wish to take ad—
vanced courses in other de-
partmenis.

“Because oi the desirability oi
a lilaeral general education. the
opportunities tor diversification
ought not to be stifled. If the
473 system is to continue, some
concessions must be made to his
dividual needs, differences. and
interests. R i g i d prescriptions
must be replaced by tlexible
willingness on the part of the
taeulty to suit the 4-3 system to
the goals and purposes of a
truly liberal arts education!"

Tom Rodliouse, senior, said
that the 4-3 courses do not
cause an overload of work. In
his opinion the system allows
him to delve into subjects
more deeply, and lie is com-
pletely in favor or the plan.

Beth Turner, senior, said, ”I
got the impression at the coffee
hour on the 473 plan that if you
were stuck with more than one
or two or these courses you'd be
better oif leaving school now in-
stead of waiting to ilunk out. 1
have four of them this semester,
and 1 don't believe I'm going to
think out because of them, Two
or the courses have integrated
the fourth hour into the course,
and in the other two, the project
is completely separate train the
main body of the course.

“I feel thtll. i will get more
stimulation from the courses
I'm taking thl year. I also feel
that, for the first time in eight
semesters at Grinnell, I will be

write a paper than le stating old

old sentences.

it will be harder work; and
it deliiiitely forces me to spend
more time than usual in ace-
demie pursuits: and it could
get quite rough it I let the
work go until the last min-
ute—but it will be my fault
it I ﬁnd mysell ‘snowerl' by
it all sometime in May, and i
feel, for once, that perhaps
111 be getting something more
than cliches and cramming tor
being in attendance here."

Mary Wetterholm, senior, said
that in her case the 473 course
in her meter was good. The out:
side work in the project was
primary research and very prac-
ti'eal for the major. However,
she doesn’t see why they
couldn't be voluntary. Although
it cuts down on the courses a
person needs, in a way it dis.
courages people from taking
courses in other flelds.
