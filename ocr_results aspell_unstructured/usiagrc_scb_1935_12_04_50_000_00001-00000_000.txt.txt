G. Lester Duke, varsity track

cussing the prospects for the 1936

inen's gymnasium. “We want all
men who are interested in running

have had high sr‘hool experience or
not does not matter, for if they
have ability we will try to develop
it."

Hopes For Big Squad
Duke hopes to have a squad of
between 30 and 35 men reporting
for regular workouts and from
which to pick the men who will
compete in the several meets which
are being booked for the indoor
season.

There are a total of seveii let—
tcrmen returning from the 1935 in-
door and outdoor squads and of
these two Will be unable to com-

increased Consumption

Consumption of electricity by
the college showed an increase of
23 per cent in November of this
year over that of the same month
last year. The entire increase for
the school year up to the end of
November was 19 per cent, al-
though a small part of this was
due to the :act that school started
earlier this year.

“Although a small part of the
increase is due to changes made
in the lights at the library, it is
obvious that the largest increase
is in the dormitories,” Paul P. Mey-
ers, maintenance superintendent.
stated yesterday,

Transformer Toned to Capacity

"In spite of the fact that the
new transformer, installed in the
dormitory several weeks ago, has
a capacity of 17% kilowatts more
than the old one, the new equip-

O. B. Badger to Address
Business Groups

Mr 0. B, Badger, a member of
the American Vocational associa-
tion, will address an open meeting
Sunday afternoon, sponsored by
the Four Keys, women’s honorary
business society, and the Corn-
merce club, men’s business group.
The meeting will be held in the
quadrangle drawing room at 2:30
o’clock.

Mr. Badger, who will talk on
the subject, “Choosing a Career in
Business,” has gained, through his
contacts with many types of occur
pations and executives, valuable in-
formation rclative to types of
training required by young people
to fit them to succeed.

He has appeared several times
on the program of the American
Vocational association, and is
speaking this week in Chicago.

He is the father of Bruce Bad-
ger, sophomore.

The tickets, which will be print—
ed on light cardboard, size nine by
12 inches, can be obtained from
any member of the local fraternity.
Everyone is urged to buy their
tickets early because of the lim-
ited number which will be placed
on sale. Kelsey said today.

Because only 400 tickets can be
sold, freshmen will not be allowed
to purchase their tickets until the
upprclassmen have had an oppor-
tunity to do so, Kelsey stated in
explaining the proposed method of
selling the tickets.

"Plenty of fun is promised ev-
eryone and the high and mighty
will get an awful roasting ah the
dinner," Kelsey said. ”We are
