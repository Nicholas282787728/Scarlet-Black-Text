OPENING
MEETING

by Brent Schondeimeyer

The method oi voting has been
changed through the ages. It would
be impractical tor us to place the
candidates in our great colosseum
and in Roman tradition give them
either the thumbs up or down Sal-
utation or stand in trout at our
dorms and shout yea or hay in the
fashion of the British parliment.
Instead the great American technoA
logy has invented the voting machine
on which we can lodge our party
preterences and award candidates
all our hopes and dreams for a
better tomorrow in theI mill at the
lever upon which we choose toapply
the pressure.

Voting: No Hassle In Iowa

But for those 01 us in the campus
community we iace anotherdecision
ih additionuwhere to vote; whether
to engage in the power politics oi
Poweshiek County or to make sure
our candidate wins back home,

According to election laws every
Citizen in the US, of the age of
eighteen years or older is pre—
sumed to have a residence some
place in the us. tor the purpose or
voting in any given election. For
election purposes a person’s resiA
dence ls deﬁned as ”the place which
one maintains as their home with
the intent to remain there pers
manently or for any indeiinite or un-
determinable length of time."
Here in Grinnell, Iowa, be-

cause of the size of the town, it
is not necessary to register beiore
election day. One must Sign an
affidavit at the poll instead which
reads as follows:

Voter's Declaration of Eligibility

I do solemnly swear or aiijrni that I
am a resident oi the A _ precinct,
A A ward or township, city or town oi
A AAA, county ot AA AA, town
i am a coalition vo|er l have not voted
and will not vote in any other precinct
in said election

l untlerskind any ialse statement in tho
declaration is a crlmlnal ntlense buiiish-
.ible as provided by law.

Many oi us in wishing to iurther
our candidate’s cause would like to
vote twice under the justiiication
of a split personality, but the at-
tadavit explicitly iorhids it. Voting
more than once could cost one anv-

imprisonment, dorms excluded.
The college campus is located in
the first ward of Grinnell and voting
is done at the Fairfax elementary
school tor those wanting to vote in
Iowa elections, Those that wanttheir
vote to count back on the homefront
will have to write home and request
an absentee ballot from their local
board of elections. This when not
orized and Sent home will accomA
plish the same thing as pulling
the lever yourself, except by mail.
It you are oi age there is no reason
tor not voting unless you are an
alien, convicted of an infamous
crime or felony, or had a legal
determination at being severely or
proioundly mentally retarded which
otters many or us an excuse. But
as someone once said, “You czln
vote without caring, but you can’t
care without voting.”

Grinnell

NUMBER 4

Joins ISPIRG

lit in mi stall run.

The Grinnell lSPIRG petition gathered the remaining signatures necessary
to make the College a member oi lSPIRG earlier this week and Grinnell
is now participating in the organization as a regular member. Acting
State lSPIRG Representative Karen Auerhach told the sail; Tuesday that
over 650 students have now signed the petition, assuring that the requisite
majority oi the student body now supports Grinnell’sentrance into ISPIRG.

The list will be Xercxedthisweek-
end and sent to the state ISPIRG
headquarters in Des Moines, ac.
cording to Ms. Auerbach, where
Grinnell will oiiicially be listed as
a new member. For, allintents and
purposes, however, Grinnell is al-
ready a participating member since
“they are recognizmg us and we
have a vote on the State Board.”

Ms. Auerbach, wlioalong with Mary

Jane Wynn has been promoting the
[SPlRG concept on campus since
last spring, is now the Acting state
Representative on the State Board,
Within the next two weeks She anv
ticipales that Grinnell Will estab-
lish its own Local lSPlRG Board
and select a local lSPIRG chaer
man. The chairmanship and posiA
tions on the board will all be open
to election. The local chairman,
she notes, is not necessarily the
same person as the State Repres
sehtative. “In tact, he probably
won’t be, since being State RepA
resentatlve is so much work," she
said.

After the Grinnell lSPIRG contriA
butinns have been sent to Des
MDines, the state ISPIEG organi-
zation will return $450 plus one
percent oi the funds collected on
campus to the local Grinnell group,
lor use in area research projects.

The next State Board meeting will
be held in Des Moines tomorrow,
and will be attended by Msﬂs AuerA
bach, Wynn, and Curt Gcrrell of the
Student Coordinator's ottice.

lSPIRG is presently in the process
oi planning several hearings which

are scheduled for the next few weeks.
Possible areas oi concern upon'
which it will concentrate its re-
search will be discussed. The first
hearings are now scheduledtorSep»
tember 19 at iowa State University
in Ames, on agricultural problems.
Grinnell senior Mary Jane Wynn
is presently scheduled to be the modA
erator of that panel, and SGA Vices
President Anne Walter may be a
panelist.

On September 21 at the University
or Northern lawn in Cedar Falls a
panel on discrimination and prison
reform will be conducted, on Sep-
tember 25 at the University of Iowa
in Iowa City a hearing concerning
public regulation ciindustryis sche-
duled, on September 28 at Central
College in Pella, Iowa, a panel on
environmental problems willbe con-
ducted October 3 at St. Ambrose
College in Davenport, Iowa, is the
date tor a hearing on consumer in
terests, health care, and housing;
and on October 5 at SimpsonCollege
in lndianola a hearing on labor and
the migrant worker will be held.

lSPIRG is also considering the posA
slbility or conducting a panel on the
educational system in lowa, although
dates and location have not hecndeA
termined. Also tentativelyschednled
is a hearing on political candidates
in Iowa, to be held sometime in Oc—
toher before the elections, although
the details have yet to be tinalized.

Once the hearings have been com-
pleted, the state organization andthe
local organizations will decide on
specific projects and begin toconA
duct research in each area.

Neubauer Drops By Grinnell

by Terry Woli

When the Executive Director or
ISPlRG came to Grinnell Monday, he
didn’t drive up in a new Oldsmobile
and he wasn't wearing a three piece
suit. in fact, this unassuming, scit
spoken young iellow looks more like
a student than an cxecutivedirector.
His hair is moderately long and he
wears jeans, His name is John New
bauer and you can ll him John,

John met with admi istrators and
small groups of students and iaculty
Monday to answer questions about
ISFIRG and his own role.

As Executive Director ollSPIRG,
John is to serve as a tiason with
the allAstudent Board of Directors
and he also oversees the protession-
al staff. John is emphatic about the
tact that ISPIRG is a student or-
ganization.

One oi the problems oi a student-
run organization, however, as an
earlier son editorial pointed out,
is the student deiinition oi public
interest. To Neubauer this is not a
problem but a virtue.

“Students are really in a better
position than anyone else to really
take a look at society,“ Neubauer
Said. “Students can be more ob-
jective than the person who is a
part oi one or two problems
A student is a person who studies
not only things that have gone on
in the past in textbooks, but should
be relating his studies to society it-
seli "

John believes that students to-
day are “withdrawn and may well
have to be demonstrated the worth
and the value oi a movement” he
tore they ccmniit themselves, Once
action hits begun, though, students
will make the commitment because,
as John puts it, “ISPIRG is a move
metit, not a bureaucracy, . .It
is an experiement in participatory

democracy ”

Neubauer feels that Grinnell and
William Penn have the most acA
tively interested students and that
Grinnell's seat on the Executive
Committee insures a direct deA
cision-making role {or Grinnell,
Grinnell hits it turtlier link to ISPIRG;
the present research director is a
Grinnell graduate.

John has near pertect credentials
lor the job, combining youth, exA
perielicc and familiarity with lowa.
Born and raised for eighteen years
on a [drill ill Illinois, he attended
Drake University where he received
an accounting degree in 1970. In his
junior year it Drake, Neubaucr
helped organize and eventually he-
became Executive Director 01 an

Accounting Aid Society which pro-
vided accountingservices for low in—
come persons and nonAproiitorganA
izaLlons. From the post, he moved
into the Executive Director’s posi»
tion in a Nadervlike ConsumerPro-
tection Agency in Des Moines. The
experience is there, but so is the
youth Neubauer is 24; each of the
other threeprolessiunalsonlhestatl‘
is under 30,

John is currently skipping across
the stite, trying to help students
set in motion the wheels of what
has the potential for being a power
iiil vehicle tor social change.
He hopes to return to Grinnell and
when he does, he'll probably come
the same way he did this time:
hitching.
