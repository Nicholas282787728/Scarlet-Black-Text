delight by local rcotball enthusiasts“
it has been rumored that Rosenthal,
assistant coach at Minnesota the past
year, would come to Glilluell, but it is
stated locally that no application has

announcement puts this and other ru-
morc to rest. .

Oscar solern is not a new man to
Grilliiell athletics. Last tell he was
the line coach at ttie Grrnncll football
camp near Minneapolis, and he already
knows the Griilnell team personally.
This last fall lie was the coach or the
Des Moines East Hing team, which'
,niade such a brilliant showing in state
football circles. lie‘ is also a former
Minnesota star. llal'lng played a won-
derful game at the end position there.

The reasons which probably influ-
.enced the Board oi Control in his so.
lection were many. They thought that
.he already knew the inert personally
{and could theretore build up a team
much easier than otherwise. He also
