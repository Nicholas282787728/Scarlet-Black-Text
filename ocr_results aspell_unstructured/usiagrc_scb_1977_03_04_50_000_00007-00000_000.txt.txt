«Victory!

by Mike Salsaich

Playing at Darby before a very
rowdy and vociferous crowd,
everything seemed to go right [or
the Pioneers. Early in the game,
Grinnell took an 18712 lead, only to
lose it playing poorly on defense.
The real excitement came in the
lastz minutes of the half when they
edged closerand closer to Chicago

ironic Orth tied the game up, and
Roy Shepard put the Pioneers
ahead with a foul shot. As the
P' nears headed for the locker

m at half, in the midst of a

standing ovation, they led 39-37,

When Grinnell retumed for the
start of the second half, they were
determined to win. Coach Peters
son’s crew led by as much as 15 at
one point. Gunnar Thors played an
excellent defensive game, con-
tinually blocking shots and pulling
down rebounds. Roy Shepard also
played well as he came out of
nowhere to grab 11 rebounds.
Crowd favorite Scott Lewis added
21 points.

“They really wanted this one
'r y intended on winning and they

en't to be denied,” stated

Coach Peterson, with a smile
which comes from a long awaited
victory. “It’s a good feeling to

half points away from third and
gel up in seventh place.

each Mo Hunt reasons that
'three matches are largely
responsible for Grinnell's finishing
in seventh. The first match con-
cerns a questionable judgment by
the referee. Corcaptain Gordon
Stacey iought a close match
against his Monmouth opponent.
Coach Hunt and the spectators
agree that Stacey controlled the
134 pound match’s momentum.
Then, as Hunt says, “Stacey lost in
mime on reieree's decision. I
never question officials but this
time the Monmouth kid did not do

‘iing and , . . Stacey got
5 afted. He was the more
aggressive of the two and me
referee’s decision was wrong."

More ill happenings included
senior cocaptain (167) Hosea
Engram’s coming down with the
flu. This marks the fourth straight
year when Engram encountered
bad luck before the Conference
meet. The third pivotal match was
the heavyweight match of Harvey
Pegues against the two-time
conference champion, Pegues,
early in the day lost by the narrow

. ught Lawrence's representative
and lost, primarily because of the
earlier winding match. Hunt says
“Pegues is clearly the second best
h‘ 3 weight in the conference and

oecause of his bad schedule he
didn’t place.”

Despite the team’s ill luck in
these matches, Grinnell did have
some highlights. Rick Lee (158)
finished second in one of the
conference’s tougher weight
classes. Along with this good news,
this year's - team—the best in
eleven years—loses only one
grappler: Engram.

Great

The Grinnell Volleyball club
madc a welcome change Tuesday
by giving rather than receiving
some ”first year lumps," The team
defeated Cornell, who is also in
its first year of competition, 15-l,
154%, 1578. Coach Tom Latimer was
pleased with the team’s per»
formance, stating “we made some
good plays, and worked well
together.”

Steve Fernstrom played an
outstanding game and was
awarded the honorary “game
ball." Fernstrom led the team in
down spikes (unreturned spikes).
Others who were cited by Latimer

ners. As the Pioneers swamped
Carleton and Cue last weekend.
Chambers authored a new school
and pool record in the 1650 yard
freestyle. In defeating those op-
pnnents Grinnell regained
possession of Dilly Duck, symbolic
of the best dual meet record in the
conference.

Team members expressed a
hope that many students would
make the trip to the University of
Iowa to watch this Weekend‘s
proceedings. SGA is running a bus
for the finals on Saturday af-
ternoon. Should Grinnell take the
title, obermiller will happily
consent to the traditional winners
toss into the pool,

Digs!

as having played outstanding
games were Chuck Platter. Eric
Edwalds, and David Blough Neil
Fleming, the squad’s only senior,
was credited with making some
great digs (saves of spikes).

Grinnell's J.V. also notched their
first victory ever by defeating four
Cornell varsity players and two
substitutes 1315, 15-8, 1578. This
could well be the only Victory of the
season for both teams, since, as
Latimer Stated “Cornell wasn't
indicative oi the caliber of play in
our conference." The, only
remaining competition for the
team is a tournament with cone
fereiice teams Saturday. March
12th.
