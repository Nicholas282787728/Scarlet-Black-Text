World Wlde Web pages concern College

Soon ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

Grinnell students can now cre»
are world wide web (WWW) pages
through the VAX, but the policy
governing these pages is still being
determined

Creating a web page is now eas—
ierthan before. Students and faculty
can contact librarian Kevin Engel by
e—mail (VAX [engelkD and he will
work individually with people to
show them how to construct a
WWW page.

However, the Student and Ac
ademic Computing Committees,
SACC and ACC, have beenconsid—
ering many issues since last semester
for the new WWW policy. Guide.
lines are being considered for politi.
cal activities, slander, pornography,
internet businesses, and copyright
violations.

currently, Grinnell’s web polls
cy is to prevent people from being
harmed by other’s computing. In
accordance with this policy, a limit
is put on how much of the system's
resources astudent’s or faculty mem—
ber’s WWW page can use rather
than on the content. The excep—
tions are Internet businesses and ads
vertising run through the Orinnell
computer system, and partisan fund—
raising.

WWW pages are defined as (me
ing system resources when more than
5,000 people access thepageaday or
titty megabytes of information is
downloaded from the page. When
WWW pages are accessed this fre—
quently, other system users are
harmed because the computer slows

down for them. The limit has only
been reached once and the student
was asked to remove the page,

Freedom otspeech is one maior
consideration. and members of both
SACC and ACC are attempting to
write a policy giving students and
faculty as much freedom as possible.

Slander is a hot topic because
WWWpagcs give people theoppor
rtinity ropublicly harmsrudents and
faculty around the world. Accord—
ing to John stone, the system ad.
ministrotor of MathLAN, slander

harm students or faculty,

Due to recent bills proposed in
Congress, restrictions on potnogtar
phy must also be considered. Bills
like the Exon Act attempt to assign
serious penalties to anyone whoplac»
es pornographic material on the in»
ternet or controls the computers
where pornographic material has
been placed. If bills like this pass,
Stone could be responsible and go to
rail for pornographic material placed
on the Web by a student

The business enterprises which
run through the orinnell computer
systems for profit are another issue
because the businesses could threat—
en the non-profit standing of the
college. Special cases have been
allowed for the sale of some educa»
tional items.

In addition, political actiVities
are expressly forbidden in the com»
putetuset’s policy, burseveral polir.
ical groups have been given comput—
er accounts. Accotding to Bill Fran—
cis, director of computer services,
the groups have beenallowed tocon.
tinue because they have not abused

theiraccounts with mass mailings to
all students orother activities. The

difficult to limit copyright violations.

Guidelines established by ACC
will be enforced as the need arises
rather than as an active attempt to
control WWW page content. If a

computer and phone hearing board.

Survey assesses student health needs

ANDY WEIDNER
STAFF Woman

The Committee on Student
Health recently conducted a cams
pus-wide survey in order to better
assess the health needs of students
at Gtinnell. The results of this
scientificsutveyhavebeenanalyzed
by committee members, and a num.
ber ofptogtams are now being pro«
posed to combat problems and ad—
dress concerns expressed by those
polled.

One of the problems that be-
came apparent through the survey
is a lack of information as to what
services are available to students.
According to Committee Chair
Elise Allen, the results ofthe survey
were "a little frustrating“ because it
teaffltmed theit tear that many stu-
dents do not know what is available
to them. “There seems to be a
question otivhat is the health cenr
ter?" remarked Trevor Porath, also
a member of the Committee on
Student Health

For example, the survey results
show that 1 1% ofthose polled did not
know that the Health Center dlSIHlJ‘
utes condoms for free. Many also
commented that they were dismayed
by the fact that nowhere in any ofthe
literature that the college hands out is
it made known that students are enti—
tled to five free Visits to the Mental
Health Center.

In order to close this information
gap, the committee plans to use a
system much like the one already in
place at Smith College. Smith's sys—
tem consists otsemppermanent fold—
erscontaininginformationonvarious
health issues to be posted in every
dorm bathroom on campus.

By posting health information in
bathroom stalls, the CSH hopes to, as
Porath put it, (‘capture a captive audi.
ence as SGA has already successfully
done with their minutes.” lfthe infor<
mationtoldersareapprovedthectsm
mlttee plans to fill the folders with
infotmation on at least tour topics
which include STDs, coping with

stress, breast cancer, and infoﬂnir
tion on the Mental Healih Center.

Another concern expressed in
thesurveyhasalready been addressed
through the installment ofsoap dis-
pensers in dorm bathrooms “I feel
like the soap in the bathrooms is our
inaior accomplishmenlin campus
this big really needs it," said Allen.
The Committee on Student Health
also worked, in coniunction with
SOA, to make changes in the dining
halls With regards to nutritional in»
formation and overall Sanitation.

Finally, one of the maior prob.
lems that students see is a lack of
information on Hlv testing, as 68%
of those polled did not know where
to go to have such a test done. cur.
rently, students must travel eitherto
Iowa City or Des Moines to be tested
for the HIV virus. In the future, the
committee hopes to be able to pro-
Vide free, confidential HIV testing
on campus, but both Allen and Porath
acknowledged that it might takesev—
eral years to realize this goal
