and Shows Beaulilul Pictures,

"Our Common Birds and their
Haunts” was the plainbrrtsigriiiioant
title or an entertaining address given
last night by Frank M. Chapman or
New York. Tire church was iairly
well iilled and everyone Seemed intent
on the speaker and his pictures.

Professor Norris introduced the
speaker whose attitude at lirst seemed
a merely patronizing one, but Llle
eilects oi his peculiar manner were
soon lost in tire interest or his subject.
He soon convinced his audience that
lie was thoroughly iarniliar with the
study ci' birds and introduced the
main body at his talk with a little
preiace concerning ornitholoey in
general. Thedutyot the bird student,
as he states it, is not only to observe
the facts concerning our- ieatliered
iriends but ultimately to determine
their relation to roan, He also pointed
o u l: L h 9 scientiﬁc, economic an d
aesthetic value which birds have for
mankind, speaking of them as the
most interesting and hearrtiiul expres-
sions oi nature’s art. .

The pictures which air, Chapman
threw upon the screen neresingularly

were made iroin his own photographs

colored under his personal super sion.
