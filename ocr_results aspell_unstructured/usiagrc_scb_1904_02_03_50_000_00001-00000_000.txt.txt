Pena court Small.

In a game against odds and ripe‘
on a foreign llmr the scarlet and
black dcicrtted the baskcl ball
team representing Central Uni»
versity of Pellrt last Saturday. The
contest cmphasced strongly the
fact that what basketball most
needs to make it a representative
college sport is the introduction
and enforcement of a lule requir-
ing absolutely disinterested om
cials. This change alone can
raise the game to the popularity
it rightfully deserves.

The game was played on a
court whose sideline was but a
few inches removed from the wall
of the building, and a striking
feature was the calling oi fouls
against Grinncll men for stepping
over the Iinc ou throtts, These
fouls and the diminutive size of

LECTURE COURSE COMMENT,

Two facts are patent. The ﬁrst
is that Grinnell audiences are her
ing offered as complete a course
of lectures and entertainments as
was ever presented in this city.
It is a matter of general notice
that each lecturer is supplemented
by his successor, and that no dis
course has been, or will he grven
which is the padded product of a
professional lecturer, interested
solely in pleasing llIS audience,
each speech having the distinct
and lasting value only conveyed
by the man who thoroughly knows
his subject. The other fact is that

limphttically the event of the

week at lowa College wrs the

house warming reception at the

Meat s Cottage last Saturday night,

The opportunity had come to all

connected with tlte institution to

inspect the popular domicile which

dentsthc nearest approach to a
home that is obtainable when girls
are far front the parental roof and
the scenes of childhood, The re-
sultwas that the three hundred
people who called between the
hours of 7:30 and to found the
legendary UtopiaofThomasMorc
fairly out done in actual life, at
least so far as ladles’ dormitories
are concerned, Tlle rooms that
were viewed were models of tasty
co7lness, furnished and arranged
with all the tact of the modern
college girl. The refreshments
that were served would have made
the monarch of the vine blush [or
shame to think his very viands
could beso disguised as to rob him
oftht: credit for the triumph of
his own arr. Thatthesc elcnten \
of a thorough social success were
blended in the right proportion lS
attcstcd by thc general satisfnc
tion of all concerned.
Aslhcgucsts arrlvcd cloalcsand
overcoats wcrc divested and the
people were ushered directly into
the large reception room of the
lions post a committee of rer
ceivcr and into the dining room
when: seventy boarders are led

ground floor at the new addition
The walls are of a delicate tint,
above the walnut wainscoting
which compr s the lower ﬁve
feet on all sides and is adorned
with pieces of china donated by
the inmates of the house. Here
in this room each guest was pro
vided with a card souvinir, tied to
the lapel of the coat or pinned to
the rul'l'lcs if the caller happened
to be a lady. A tour followed to
the second ﬂoor with the piloting
ofa resident guard who met you
at the head at the rear flight of
stairs to guide the bewildered
sight secr through the halls and
back to the stairway. The
third lloor was inspected in
the same manner, the visitor paus-
ing at every threshold to peer in—

The state contest this year will

be quite a numbcror ottLlcnts horn

A clipping from one of the state
ddlltesbegillsthni: "Grltlnclllns
followed out the old tradition of
hospitnlrty by failing to get its
own orator on the program when
it is to entertain the State Ot-atorir
calAssociatlon," Thismightsecm
to some to border on the sarcastic,
but it brings out the thought that
Grinncll should do its best to
show the Visiting schools ltcr tra<
ditional hospitality.

An exceedinglyrnteresting busi-
ness meeting will be held on the
morning of the 26th, at which
there will probably be a lively
display of oratory not on the pro»»
gram. The question of doing
away with the double set ofjudges
on thought and composition and
on delivery will come up and will
doubtless meet with warm opposi-
tion. Anotllcr change to be pro-
posed is that of dividing the state
into two sections tor preliminary
contests, the winners of which are

 

to meet in ﬁnal contesl,
