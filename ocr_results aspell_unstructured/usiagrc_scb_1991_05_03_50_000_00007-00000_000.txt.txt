Gay radicalism vs. gay equality

Last week the Static! and/Black
ran no fewcr than five letters in
response to my April 19 column,
“On Pride Week." That column
tritert more than a few people, buti
made no apologies nt Lhe time, and
I make none now, And if these
letters were the best that the staff
received about the column, Iwould
be loathe to read the worst, because
these were a poor lot, making few
appeals to logic and fact and tend-
ing instead to issue wild generalir
unions and accusations. I speak in
particular of Richard Lodcr's out-
burst, so puerile and irrational that
it seemed income not (rum 3 meme
ber of the Chemistry Department
but from a feral child.

Lcder began bydamningmy‘nrt
ive, wrongrheaded and cynical"
column, whiohhe later alleged was
marred by “intolerance," (he used
this word audits synonymsso often
that I came to be reminded of a
dripping faucet) “false premises,"
and the “slighting” of minority
groups. l-lechargedthatl“defended
gayrbashers." and in lieu of evi-
dence he offered that I said that it's
fashionable to attack prejudice
against gayk‘hsif there were any
Lime in America when it would be
inappropriate to attack such prejur
dice." Leder neatly elided the dis
tinction between “fashionable" and
“inappropriate.” 1 said that being
anti-”homephobia" is fashionable;
by what stretch of the imagination

Washburn

did this suggest that gay-bashing is
an appropriate course? At most it
implied that opposing
“homophobia" is more in vogue
than, say. opposing antirSemiLism
orbigoLryagainstWASPS.Ledcr’s
charge aboutdet’ending gay~hashets
exploded. there is no justification
for him calling me”intolerant" five
times and claiming that l slighted
minority groups.

Mark Baumann‘s letter referred
to two recent comedies to support
its backhanded arguments. True, in
Splash John Candy passes out cope
ies of Penthouse to everyone he
sees, but probably because being
featured in a magazine ranks as the
biggest achievement of his life. i
have not seen Pretty Woman. so I
cannot respond to his assertions
about that film.

Beforeattemptingtocriticizemy
column Peter Willmert could use a
lesson or two in remedial reading.
“Mr. Washburn’s column.“ he
wrote, “claim[ed] that homosexu-
ality should cause no more pride
than heterosexuality. if both rue
equally ‘natural,’ Why nature al-
ways gets trotted around in sexual
discussions bv the far rightI do not
understand,”lwrote,Mr.Willmert,
not that I ﬁnd both orientations

equally natural—whether I do is
besidemy point—butthatgays will
tell you that they are and therefore
to be consistent gnys should, like
straight people, not regard their
“natural" orientation as a source of
pride. I'm not the one by whom
“nature gets trotted around."

Willmert asked whether a cela
ebratlon like “Pride Week” can re
ally be considered aspecial entitle-
ment. His own letter demonstrates
that it is indeed just that, an ex»
ample of gay elitism, a privilege
gays do not want other groups to
have. He mentioned that several
right-wing student organizations at
the University of Massachusetts
held arough equivalent, a “Straight
Pride Rally." This he, like others,
takes to be an example of bigotry
and intolerance. though it’s simply
the reverse of something to which
gaysbelieve they incontestablyhave
arighLSimilareventsonothercam-
pus/es, he Kenyon and Yale. have
generated anger at heterosexual in~
tolerance, though heterosexuals
have merely been asserting a right
which gays take for granted

In New York City one may at-
tend “Gay Film Festivals;" at a
growing number of universities
thereare “Gay Studies" courses: on
this campus there isaneventduring

Affirmative action: Is justice served?

We as a society have a way of
going overboard. when we decide
we need to solve a problem, we
often fail to recognize the damage
ofthe solution and, in so dorng, kill
the patient to cure the disease. Two
weeks ago a writer for this paper
argued against what our society has
cometocall,rat.hereuphemist.ically,
“affirmative action." It is unfonu»
nate that this part of his argument
was forgotten in the stampede to
attack the less logical and less sig-
nificant argument in his column
regarding Pride Week. The truth is,
we as a group do not like to discuss
the problems of “affirmative ac-
Lion,“ for in doing so we would
have to Confront the failure of the
supposed solution.

The problem which “affirma-
tive action" is predicated on isa real
and terrible one: how to make up
for Lt history of persecution of mt
norities in this country. The goal is
aJustone: to rnakeallpcoplein our
society equal in every way. Howe
ever, the question is. does the solu-
tion work? No. it does not. It is
based on the concept that if you
give people a share of the pieat the
top, whether they qualify or not,
you will make up for Lhe pain and
suffering at Lhe bouom. This solu-

tion. however. does not lead to the
stated goal of social and economic
independence it is purported to do
sire; instead it maintains the same
old problems of racism.

The failure is simple enough If
we wampeopie to see each otheras
free and equal without regard to
race, then that must be the reality.
The reality of the current system,
however, is it kind of insidious to-

kenism.Sothatinstitutionscanbrag
about their multicultural composi-
tion, they lower standards for fac-
ulty and student alike. Does this
meet the goals of “affinnative ac-
tion?” No. it does not. In the end it
simply leads to the same old stereo-
types, but now in reverse, “why is

institution craves, What does this
lead to? We all know the answer,

It leads to more oppression and

Well. it’s been almost a year
since I've hzid the glorious title of
SGA President. I have to admit that
it’s been pretty nice knowing mat]
have been the most important stu-
dent on campus for this period. that
everybody looks up to me as I pass
them around campus. that players
are offered nightly on my behalf.
Perhaps the disappearance of all
the groupies will be the hardest
blow of all. Alas. though, I will
persevere.

Interestingly,however.ldo have
some observaLiorls. comments, and
general babble to offer you as my
term draws to an end. First ofall,l
am frankly surprised that more of
you do not avail yourselves of the
hired help you have at your dis-
posal, You havea ten-memberCabia
not (which you pay) and 23 sena-
tors at your service willing to voice
and act on your thoughts,

Thinkaboutit,whereelsein life
will you get Lheopportunity to come
plain about lack of pencil sharpen-
ers and inslantiy have people with
the titles of “SGA President" and
“Executive Vicepresident/Acting
Director oflhe Physical Plant" pare
ticipating in a quest to satisfy your
demands? Where else can you
write a letter Complaining about
smoke in the dining halls and in-
stanLly have a meeting of the Com»
mittee on Student Life called to
discuss a ban on smoldng in the
dining halls? [say it whenever] get
the chance: students really do have
a say in what goes on. HOWEVER,
itis only those that choose to voice
their desires that are. in reality. rep—
resented.

My suggestion is easy: if you
ever have a complaint dealing with
anything even remolely under the
heading of “an aspect of student
life,“ call SGA. Let them deal with
italso, Ofcourse, we aren‘t always
successful, but we have a darned
good trackarecord (believe itornot).
If you don't know how to contact
someoneinSGA,justaskyoursena-
tor; or. better yet. you can log-on to
the VAX and tell [SGA], It's truly
uiat simple.

In other words, SGAis there for
you (corny, but mle). In fact,1’m
convinced that self-importance
among SGA people increases the
more ephemeral SGA seems. SGA
is simple to understand. so». has
$180,000 plus to spend every year,
Use some of it for your group or
cause, SGA also has several people
dying to represent the “snidents”

ions, I hasten to hit you over the

work. Ask questions. suggest is-
sues (make up issues, evekthat
works also). provide input, provide
constructive criticism (provide de-
structive criticism if it’ll make you
feel better). Iust use SGA.

SGA may well be the most un-
elite thing to do on this campus.
son people have to do what the
students ask them to do. How de-
meaning, eh’! If you stop and think
about it, the title of President may
perhapsbe the most unrelite aspect
of SGA; one takes all of the ﬂack
for failings (perceived or real) in
SGA, one spends an inordinate
amount of time responding to mail,
holding ofﬁce hours, talking with
administmlors. etc., etc, etc.. I as-
sure you, there’s nothing glamor»
ous about it (although I just spent
two days working on my resume.
and i have to admit the title does
look mighty ﬁne on print).

In all seriousness, I would not
have traded thisexperienceforany-
thing. i truly have had a wonderful
year. By far, mostGrinnell studens
are great people. This campus is
also much less apathetic than most
(we're just a little busier, that‘s all).
Matt and Minnie are competent
people and will do a great job, Just
don’t forget to give them “lots of
stuff“ to do—it’s the least they can
do for getting to pick any room on
campus that they want.
