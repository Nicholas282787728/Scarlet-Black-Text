Police chief expects
’resolution’in bath Friday
and Monday bomb threats

School and police ofﬁcials were
optimistic midweek that perpetrators
of bomb hoaxes at Grinnell High
School on Monday and at Grinnell
Middle School last Friday would be
found alid charged.

“We have obtained quite a bit of
information so far," said Police Chief
Mike Birmingham late Wednesday
referring to the GHS scare, the second
in two school days. “In the next ﬁve to
ten days, we’d like to say we’ve got
something. I'll be surprised if there
isn‘t a resolution to this one."

He added that the threat at Grinnell
Middle School last week“might take a
little longer, but we're seeing some
progress on both of them."

Dr. David Stoakes,principal at GHS,
said, “We've had a lot ofhelp from the
student body, giving us infon'nation"
on the most recent bomb threat. The
reason? Stoakes said, “The majority
by farofourstudentbodyis very angry
about what happened [Monday]."

What happened was this: At approxi-
mately 10:15 am. Monday, a Gl-lS
custodian discovered the written bomb
threat by a urinal in the men‘s room at
the south end of the building’s west
corridor. The custodian took the note
to the ofﬁce, and within minutes the
police had been called and evacuation
ofthe building had begun.

The students traveled by bus to Grin-
nell Middle School, itselfthe site ofa
bomb scare Friday.

Meanwhile, a corps ofteachers, po—
lice and school custodians searched
the GHS building. “Under the ‘sad but
true‘column,we're gettingpretty good
at it,”said Stoakes. GHS \vasthe targed
of three similar threats last year.

“It takes at least an hour and a half.
We go through every classroom and

every locker, both in tile hallways and
in the locker room. We do it in a really
systematic way to make sure we don’t
miss something," said the principal.

At the end ofthe search, school ofﬁ»
cials and police conferred and made
the determination that the building
could be opened to the public again.

Students began loading onto buses
for the return trip to GHS at about
12:30 p.m., Stoakes said.

GHS was the site ofthree such scares
last year, forthe middle school, Friday’s
threat was only the second in memory.

Harsh penalties
If ultimately apprehended, the indi-
vidual making a bomb threat could be
the target ofharsh penalties. “The ad-
ministrators cansuspendsomeone from
school for ten days, which we'd imme
diately do,” said Stoakes. “Anything
beyondthat wouldcome from the board
of education. We'd take a recommen-
dation to the board of education for
expulsion from school. And that's just
from the school side."
Civicpenaltieswould be even stiffer.
Birmmgham said Iowa law places
bomb threats underthe arson code, and
classiﬁes them" as Class D felonies,
whichcarrymaximumpenalties ofﬁve
years in prison and $7,500. Ofcourse,
convicted felons also lose the right to
vote and the right to hold ofﬁce.
Stoakes stressed the role of commu-
nication before, during and after
Monday's hoax. “We talked to the stu—
dent body aﬁerthe sitlation at Littletori,"
hesaid,referringtothetragedyinColo-
rado last week, “and we explained to
themwhy, wheneverwe have an emer-
gency situation. we needtheircoopera-
tion. We need them to talk to us."
Birmingham conﬁrmed that both

ership continue to provide fascinating
information ‘

The latest is Jim Stnckler of Chi-
cago who sends a clipping of a fullr
page article from the Sunday, April 4,
issue ofNew YorkTimesby his fellow
Chicagoan, Noah Liberrnan, both of
these gentlemen also former
Grinnellians.

Liberrnan’sarticle,entitled“AGlove
Affair" and subtitled “Driven Over,
Mlcrowaved and Soused, Leather En-
duresasthePlayers'ChoiceforMitts,”
is an erudite discussion ofthe process
ofdeveloping a baseball glove worthy
ofthe game‘s best players.

“It's a great article," says Strickler,
and yes, it certainly is.Liberman' cur-
rently is a free-lance writer, and a very
good one to have his work printed in
the New York Times.

It might also be pointed out that
earlier in his career, Liberrnan was a
sports editor for thc Gi-inncll Herald—
chister, that his father, “Mike"
Libenrtan, a professor of English at
Grinnell College, also was an author
andagreatbascballfan, and his mother
Mathilda Libcrman was formany ycars
director of the writing laboratory at
Grinncll College.

“lfyoukeepcitingpeoplefromCali-
fomia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and [iii-
nois, you might considerchanging the
namc of the column to ‘Around the
Country‘," says Stricklcr.

Actually, Around is glad to hear
from far-ﬂung readers who add a great
deal to those submissions from local
folk. In fact, suggestions are what
makes columns like “Around" more
interesting, and the more the merrier.

Therearcsoinanythingsgoingonin
Grinncllthat it’s sometimeshard toget
“around" to covering them all, so con—
tributions are welcome.

The genesis of Around was that it
was to express ideas from a variety of
writers. Sometimes that happens and
sometimes it doesn’t, but inputalways
is welcome.

time since Around has heard from

Thephilosophical battle ofthe ﬂow-
ers vs. hamburgers, begun by girls of
the Maid Rite Marlins and the Bates
Flowers Phillies ofthe Pinto League of
the Grinnell Youth Baseball/Softball
Association during a photo session last
week, continues,

Although league play is a month
away, rivalry is high.

Responding to a supplication from
Aroundinlastweek'sissuefora“gentle
reader" to settle the controversy, Pam
Montgomery of Montgomery/Ford
Maidrite, admittedly partisan, offers
the following:

Dear Around:

Regarding the dilemma between the
MaidrRite Marlins and Bates Flowers
Phillies in last Thursday's column, one
should stop to ponder these important
factors:

Both ﬂowers and Maid-Rites have a
most pleasnt aroma, which makes eve
eryone smile.

Generally, however, when glventhe
option ofeating a sandwich ora flower,
Maid-Rites would bethe meal ofchoice.

You can have a shake with a Maid—
Rite, but you shouldn’t shake a ﬂower
(although some do.)

You can wear a ﬂower but you
shouldn‘t wear a Mald»Rite (although
some do.)

While ﬂowers require food and wa~
ter, MaldrRites are food and waterisan
option.

Ifstranded on a desert island, which
would you prefer‘.7

How about giving the little lady a
dozen Maitl»thcs on your next annlr

possibility ofanolher anniversary be~
fore you give sandwiches.

if you had to make a delivery to a
house with a questionable pooch on the
porch, would youratherbedcliveringa
dozen ﬂowers or a dozen Mold-Rites?

Because Montgomery/Fords love
nature‘s ﬁttest (and we mean ﬂowers!)
and Whites often enjoy Maid-Rites,
this truly doesn’t help reach a conclu»
sion to this quandry.

Sincc noilhortcam lacks thc spirit of
competition necessary to emerge trir

lins!” and keep ﬂailing, “Around",. 3’

Students, professionals work
to salvage a bad situation

A pair ofbonib threats on consecu-
livc school days touched off conjec—
ture here this week: could Gnnnell be
the site of a school tragedy like the
recent one in Littleton, Colo? But
Grinnellians seemed to be taking the

' opportunity offered by tile scares to do

some reﬂecting and find wzlys to avert
such an incident, if possible, before it
arose.

A conversation with GHS students
sketched a picture ofa student body
that sees some of its issues with re-
markable clarity and can't quite Come
prehend others.

For example, about the most recent
bomb threat at GHS, a threat the news
of which was deliveicd over the
school’s public address system at ape
proxirrratcly 10:15 am. Monday, one
sophomore automatically thought the
worst. She said. “When the announce-
ment came on, Ijumped real fast. But
when they said it was a bomb threat, I
thought it was a prank."

And of course, she was right.
Monday’sthreatmak’esthe fourth sucll
threat the high school students have
endured in the past two years.

Ofcoursc, no one wants threats like
those the past week to escalate to ace
tual violence, and at the same time,
paliencewiththe constantdlctofthreats
was wearing thin this week. One OHS
student, in a conversation Tuesday,

 

Stronger leadership needed
on control of weapons

During the ongoing postmortem on the Littleton massacre, a recurring
assertion has been that surely now is the time forthc nation to get serious about
dealing with the ready availability of weapons. That's wiry it was disappointing
when President Clinton announced a fairly tame plan Tuesday that rcprcscnts
only an incremental approach to the problem.

Clinton‘s plan has been in the works for some iirne 7 long before the
Colorado tragedy 7 but the killings at Columbine High School apparently
didn‘t convince the administration that the time was right for a major legislative
proposal that would include niucll stronger controls on the purchase and
possession ot’handguns and other weapons,

True, the president did call for iiew regulations on explosives, and hc warns
Congress to enact measures that, among othcl things, would l'qulirc safety
locks on guns and, in cenaiil cases, make parents liable in the event they allow

their kids access to gilns. The
proposals also include cxpnrrtlirigthc

called Monday‘s hoax “stupid and a
waste oftime," One called it “inuna»
titre."

Yet another added, “That kind of
thing gives teenagers a bad name, and
we already have bad name in the media
anyway." Another said, “They think
its funny to see how much they can
make 600 people squirm."

And maybe the psyhcholcgy behind
abombtllrcat,orbehind niorepalpablc
acts of violence, has something to do
with power, but it also has to do with
tllc \vay society functions, and the way
individuals function in society.

‘Serious rislt’

Dr. Laura Van Cleve of the Fow-
cshiekCounty Mental Health Center
outlined,inapreparedstatement,“sev-
eral factors that inﬂuence the 'likeli-
hood of violent behavior in young
people.”Thoseinclude,shcsaid,lowcr
socioeconomic status, difﬁcult tem-
pcranicnt, a history ofparciital mental
illness, andehronic illnesses including
psychiatric illness. Tliosefactorscom~
blned with access to ﬁrearms and a
culture of violence “present a
partlularly scrious risk," she said.

“On the other hand," Van Cleve‘s
statement said, “youths are less likely
to behave violently when they have
intact family structures, positive peer
group relations and supportive com
munities.”

lit a conversation later, slle added,
“The risk groups I wrote down are
somewhat intuitive but it all knd of
boils down to feeling excluded from
the community or not feelin g account
able to tile society."

And, in her statement, she pointed
out that preventative measures can

“begin as early as prenatal care for
mothers and can be as simple as a
teacher whotakesthetime to reach out
towards a shy student.”

“Those risk factors and protective
factors," Van Cleve also said, “that‘s
not myopinian. Those are well-doom
mented facts from medical literature.”

Police Chief Mike Birminghamwent
further, saying, “It's kind oflike some
people don‘t have any clue on how to
deal with life issues. They don't have
the proper life skills. Those come from
a strong family base, nurturing, and
reinforcement, A larger segment of
society all the time does not have that
background, and they‘re placed in a.
situaiton in life where they make bad
decisions.Consequently,youhavecir—
cumstances like Monday at the high
schoolandattherruddlcschoolFriday,
and it sets off a whole list of conse-
quences for a whole list ofpeople.”

‘What is true’ _
Ofcourse, a lot ofpeople on that list
are the students. In a conversation with
high school students Tuesday, a few
major themes emerged, and one was

senior said, “I don‘t think people can

more about the day-to-day life of the
