LEAGUE GAME LOST!

Ifbasebull at ioiva Cullcgcis
to take a brace, the team must re-
ceive better support from the sin-
dent body. The number oi paid
admissions out to the game this
altelnoon would disgrace a coun-
try village oi halt a thousand peo-
ple. Hanging around the out-
skirts out of reach of the guards
to escape paying admission is
showing poor Iorm of college loy-
alty. The uneven, grassy campus
diamond was responsible tor the
many errors and had its effect on
raising thescores. The game was
called at fouro’clock.

In the ﬁrst inning \Nllliztms
reached ist through error by Fisk
on account of uneven ground,
Struble thrown out at lst and Sto-
rey caught out by Marsh. Yates
struck out. Fisk, ﬁrst man up
for Grinnell, singled and reached
ﬁrst, Clark ﬁcw out to left ﬁeld,
Schilling reached ist on Fisk, out
at 2d. Wilcox walked to ﬁrst.
Schilling stole 2d and 3d, and
Wilcox and Schilling scored on
Marsh'sttvo-baggcr. Thompson
got ﬁrst on error on Storey. King
struck out and retired side.

In the second inning, Iowa, by
hard hitting and aided by an error
or two, brought in six runs. Grins
ncll added two to their scorer

The terriﬁc smashing was con»
tinued in the third inning, Stru-
ble was hit in the head and well-
nigh put out of the game while
running to second. Iowa was re-
tired by two ﬁles to out-ﬁeld atter
increasing her score by tour runs.
Grinneli took a slump and got a
goose—egg.

In the fourth inning, Iowa in-
creased her lead by four. Grin-

nell went out in one, two, three
order. A home run by Clark and
better hitting gave Grinncll three
in the seventh. Iowa getting one.
Grinnell struck a switt gait in the
eighth and netted ﬁve luns.

 

Neither side scored in 9th.
Final score: Iowa I7,Grinnell

The Simpson Game.

The 'Varsity baseball team has
again tasted defeat, this time at
the hands of Simpson College.
The score, it to I, is easily ac-
counted for by a glance at the hits
and errors. Grinnell had a gener-
ous supply or errors but were woe-
fully lacking in hits, while the re-
verse was true in Simpson’s case.
The latter got seven hits and were
assisted by twelve errors on the
part of Grinnell, while the best we
could do was two hits.

King was in the box tor Grin-
nell and did good work after he
got steadied down. His support
was enough to take the heart out
of any pitcher. Middleton had
excellent speed and good control,
walking but one man, and Grinnell
could not ﬁnd him effectively at
the time when hits were needed.
Onronlyscorecameinthescventh
Manatt got a walk, was advanced
to third on Fiskc’s liner, hit to

center and scored on an error at
ﬁrst base.
