Triple Ply Mystery
Foils Efforts of
Sleuth.

(By Staff Dective)

Now appears the mystery Supreme,
the king pin of them all. It is one
of these triple ply, boiler plate kind
that nobody seems able to pierce. It
is also of the omnipresent, never deﬂ-
nite, maddeningly tantalizing variety

The whole thing started with a
black cat which is exactly according
to Hoyle as deﬁned in his book on
the Rules of Mystery. The black cat
in question occupied ten inches of ad-
vertising space in the Wednesday is»
sue of the Scarlet and Black.

, As master detective of the staff the
Writer was put on the case. His in-
vestigation began with the Black Cat
which preferred the advertising coir
limns to the back fence. Like the

chicken to the roost so has our com—

prehensive and untiring Search come
hack from each false scent to the
black cat of advertising fame.

Who placed the ad? Nobody knows
but the business manager and he is
a modern Sphinx for silence. We have
placed our ears to the ground and our
eyes to many a keyhole but neither
sound nor sight has served to trace
the shadowy feline or her owners,

But your inquiring reporter is a
bull pup for sticking. Be assured that
he will allow nothing to stand be-
tween him and a solution of this dark
and abiding mystery. Keep an eye
on the case; there may be a mice in
the Wcudplle!
