Hurl' As Piano

Overiurns

Henrictta Miller, James sopho—
more, narrowly escaped a severe
knee fracture Wednesday cve-
ning, when the piano in James
parlor tipped over and gashed her
leg as it fell.

Helen Kulhavy, also a James
sophomore, was helping Miss Mil.
ler try to move the upright when
it became unbalanced, apparently
due to faulty casters, and toppled
to the floor.

Miss Kulhavy sufferEd abra-
sions on the foreleg and possibly
a broken toe, according to Miss
Florenr‘e Swan, college nurse,
who was called immediately.

The piano did not fall on Miss
Miller, but evidently hit her leg
in falling, the force serving to
cut the leg, just above the lrnee,
to the bone.

blackout that means business, a
crap game’with appropriate vocal
expletives, a serenade, a quad-
rangle goodnight, and a curfew
poem rendered by Eleanor with
all the delicacy and excruciating
tendemess of a meat grinder.

The first scene that this writer
focusscd an optic upon was the
much publicised tete-a-tcte be-
tween Eleanor and iLaGuardia,
and the Little Flower certainly
blossoms all over the ARI-I stage.

Throughout the show, the cam-
pus, the administration, the fac-
ulty itself, and above all, Grin-
nell students, are nipped both
tenderly and otherwise, with all
coming in for some attention
from Pres, Samuel N. Stevens of
the first floor administration
building to Elmer Zumwalt, two
doors to the left at the heating
plant. ”

Student leaders, student lovers,
and just plain students are por~

derly, defined and identified in

New members present were
Jean Becker, Sally Bruno, and
Elinor Lee, Main freshmen; Doris
Williams, Cleveland freshman;

White and Phyllis Osborne, repn
