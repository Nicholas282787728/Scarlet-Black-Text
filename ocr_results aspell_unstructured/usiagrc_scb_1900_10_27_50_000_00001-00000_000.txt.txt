The Iowa College Lecture
Course has the reputation with
lecture bureau men of being one of
the very strongest in the west.
This year's course is an unusually
promising one. Neither money
nor labor has been spared to 567
cure the most attractive talcnt pos-
sible: and the 'course as arrang-
ed will involve a total expense of
between sr,loo and $1,200.

The ﬁrst lecturer, Ernest Setone .

Thompson, is probably, as his
manager claims, the best lecture
bureau attraction before the pub
lic this season. Mr. Thompson is
popularly known as the author ot
marvelously facinating animal
stories. He has, however, done
some solid scientiﬁc work as a
naturalist, is the author of several
technical works on zoology. and is
government naturalist to the Pro-
vince of Manitoba. Mr. Thomp-
son is a gifted artist, moreover, il-
lustrates his own works, and was
for a number ot years engaged in
illustrating the animals and birds
for the Century dictionary.

The liquid air entertainment is
one that cannot fail to interest and
instruct, A large quantity of air
will actually be on hand, and the
evening will be largely taken up
with experiments. such expcrie
merits as freezing alcohol, and
pounding nails with a hammer
made of frozen mercury are among
those announced.

Elbert Hubbard is well known
as the editor of thc “protesting"
periodical, ”The Philistine‘," as the
author of delightful “Little Jour-
neys” to the homes of famous
authors, painters. and statesmen,
etc.; and as the founder of the
Roycroft printing and binding as

Petition to President
In View of the fact that Presi-
dent Gates sevcrs his connection
with Iowa College after next week.
the students of the different class
es have circulated petitions desir-
ing that he lead Chapel every
morning until his departure.
The students realize, at least in
a measure, the value of I’res.
Gates' chapel talks and wish to
avail themselves of every opporr
tunity of hearing him during the
short time he is to remain with us.
It is indeed a gratiﬁcation to
the students to know their petition
has been granted. In considera-
tion of this fact the attendance at
chapel should he very full during
the entire week, so that in this
way we may show our apprecia-
tion of President Gates' kindness
in granting our request.

A cm to the College.
'Thirteen years ago when Presi-
dent Gates ﬁrst came to this city
no house was available for the
house of the president. H. G.
Little offered his residence for
810,000 and proposed to donate
52,500 of this sum. it purchased
for the use of the president.
Presideet Gates immediately ac-
cepted the offer, It has been his
purpose to secure donations from
his personal friends in the East to
pay the entire 27,5oo which the
residence cost and present itto
the college. In persuancc of this
purpose President Gates wrote to
Roswell Smith, proprietor of the
Century Publishing Co, and re
ceived a check for Snooo itl re
sponse. Samuel Johnson later
responded to an invitation from
the president with $500 from W.
S. Houghton, a wealthy Bostonian.
Darwin Forbes, one of Grinnell’s
old settlers. having heard of the
project, called on President Gates
and with the remark that he wish~
ed to ”put a brick in that house,“
handed him a check for 5500.
President Gates has expended
over $2,000 in improvements, be-
sides keeping up all expenses on
the house, taxes,'etc. Eight or
nine years ago he transfered the
property to the college. At the
last meeting of the trustces but
52,500 remained to be paid and
the trustees voted voluntarily to
assume that amount. The presi-

 

dent recently wrote to Arthur
Johnson, son of Samuel Johnson
of Boston. and yesterday received
in reply another thousand dollar
check. Last May Harvey Rob~
erts of the class of 1893 sent ago,
and other graduates and friends
of the president outside of the
college have contributed various
sums.

The total amount now unpaid
is 51,450, This President Gates
eventually expects to raise. The
house has been put in the hands
of the college, costing but st. 450

at the most, paid for by President
Gates and his personal friends,
strangers to Grinnell, and comes
as a material token of his interest

in the welfare of Iowa college. a

In responsetotheinvitingweather

large number of people gathered
at the athletic parkwith the expec-
tation of seeing a good football
game. Theywcrc notdisappoint-
ed.

FIRST HALF.

Captain Grifﬁth won the toss
and chose the west goal. Warner
kicked off. Stewart kicked out
from the thirty-five-yard line for
forty more. At this point Iowa
started the terrible forward march
thatbeat hcr opponents down like
straw throughout the game. On
Iowa went; but ﬁnally lost the ball
on an off-side play. Stewart
kicked forty-ﬁve yards. Here
both teams rivaled for records in
fumbling, Stewart punted forty
yards. Iowa secured the ball and
the work of Morton, Edson and
Warner was spectacular. Herc
Captain Bacon's eleven showed
their metal. McGuin kicked
twenty»ﬁve yards. Here, with but
a few minutes to play, Williams
and Warner tried a place kick and
made the ﬁrst score of the day.
Warner missed goal. Score: Iowa
