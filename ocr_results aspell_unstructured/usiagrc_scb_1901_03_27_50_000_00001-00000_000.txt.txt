Weather.

Last Saturday evening, in spite
otthe inclement weather. agoodly
number oithe Junior class braved
a drizzling rain and any amount

of Grinnell mud and betoolt them~
selves to the pleasant home of
Miss Wattcrs. The hall and stairs
weretustciully decoratedrn scarlet
and black and were a most pleasant
evidence that the hostess had plans
ned to make her guests feel at
home.

Each one came prcpnred to re-
present some book and did so in
avarietyof\Vays,someoitheguests
even going so tar as to prepare
special costumes Ior the occasion.
The principal part oi the evening
was spent in guessing the names
of the books represented, which
was a good test of literary knowl-
edge as well as oithe constructive
capabilities of one’s ideal activity.
The honors were awarded to
Miss Helen Leach, while Harry
Dickinson proudly carried oii the
booby prize. Proper stirnulusin
the shape of a delicious punch rvas
often resorted to by the guests.
The following part of the evening
was pleasantly spent in harmless
gamesin which the faculty j ined.
Partners were obtained for refreshr
merits by distributing quotations
to the gentlemen who were to ﬁnd
the answers to these in the hands
of the fairer sex, After being
served with ice cream and cake,
the guests indulged in songs and
the Virginia reel and shortly after
departed, all agreeing that Miss
Waiters was a very successful
hostess.

Dr. I-Iart, Superintendent of the
Illinois Children’s Home and Aid
Society, was the guest of the col~
lege Sunday, He gave two ndr
dresses in the Congregational
church and one in the college
chapel. His Address in the moinr

for homeless children. Instead of
keeping the child, at a continuous
expense. until it has grown tip, as
formerly, homes are tonnd
which the child is reared, thus the
child becoming an integral part of
the iamily.

Perhaps the most interesting
and instructive address was given
