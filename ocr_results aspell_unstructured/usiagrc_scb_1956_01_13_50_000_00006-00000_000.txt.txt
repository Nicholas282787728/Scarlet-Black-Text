“The show must go on," and
it looks as if Grinnell is not
going to be the one to break
tradition. Happily, the prospects
look bright for the production of
a student musical for the sixth
straight year. Applications are
now being sought for the im-
portant job of the student pro-
ducer. Anyone who has perfect
health, a world or patience, in.
defatlguble drive, has a com~
bined major in drainatics, music,
psychology, and economics, with
a minor in carpentry, and would
consider receiving a salary for
all his work as vulgar and
unthinkable. is heartily encoure
aged to apply.

The big night is April 23. The
producer can always feel some
security in the inevitable delight
the student body receives from
watching the antics of their fel-
lows on stage. i think it is sate
to say that the Student Musical
has never flopped and has al
ways been a highly entertaining
evening.

The producer will help
choose the script and lyrics
and the director sometime ai—
ter the middle or February.
Then the score must be writ»
ten and chosen and the prac-
ticing begun.
