THINK ER '3
CORNER

by Gareth Fisher

The sequence of events is, I’m
sure, firmly etched in the minds of
television viewers across the counr
try: agroup ofOld Milwaukeeloving
guys in a rustic setting enjoying their
beer until one of them proclaims:
“Guys, itjust doesn’t get any better
than this." An omniscient voice
booms in the background that they
are mistaken. Very soon, items of
value begin appearing from nowhere,
including the infamous “Swedish bi»
kini team“: a group of blond female
clones whose one ambition in life is
the gratification of these beer—loving
individuals. There is little suggestion
that the Swedish Bikini Team hold
greater value than gold found by
“Muskrat Mike", the music that ap-
pears in the background, or the beer
itself. Women are objectified and
portrayedasﬂeshy commodities. This
set of commercials are theepitome of
sexist advertising, yet nary a post
ofﬁce table was set up at Grinnell to
protest Old Milwaukee, and if PAPA
or any campus group or individual
ever entenained the notion of boy-
cotting Old Milwaukee, I certainly
heard nothing aboutit. Yet last week.
I only had to visit the post ofﬁce to
become aware that Mattel had com-
mittedamajorgaffebyhavingBarbie
tell would-beconsumcrs1“Math class
is tong 3‘

The reason for this is simple:
Very few Grinnell students enjoy
playing with Barbie; very many Grin~
nell students enjoy drinking beer. No
one wants to condemn any part of
something they enjoy. This concern
is serious enough in regard to sexist
advertising and becomes even more
serious when one considers the rela-
tivesilence aboutthe highcorrelation
between alcohol consumption and
sexual assault on college campuses,
or the fact our federal funding could
be in jeopardy with our current alco»
hol policy. The dangers of alcohol
consumption at Grinnell frequently
go without our consideration, The
current review of the alcohol/drug
policy provides us with an opportu-
nity address these concerns.

P . 1 . N . I .
Old Milwaukee, assault and alcohol policy

Like any choice or viewpoint, a
policy deserves review as often as
possible at least so we can make sure
it is right for us at any time. Without
such a review, we risk the chance of
submitting to a policy that may no
longer apply to us. In this week's
election, less than 40% ofthepopula»
tion voted for the incumbent presi-
dent. If the election had never been
held, we would be saddled with a
president with whom the majority of
the population were dissatisfied. The
alcohol policy may not change. We
can choose to “re-elect" the current
policy if we feel it meets our current
needs. We also face the hard reality
thatthefederal governmentmandatcs
the review of our alcohol policy once
every two years. Our failure to con-
ductﬂtisreview wouldjoopardizecur
federal funding.

Nevertheless, even in view of
these facts, the review of the alcohol
policy has met with serious opposi-
tion. This opposition, as I see it.
comprises two major opinions: The
first is that the Grinnell College resi-
dence hall policy is ideally one of

self-govemance. Anyfurtherrestric»
tions on our alcohol consumption
could compromise this system. The
second is the idea that the entire re»
view is a guise for a Student Affairs
conspiracy to make thealcohol policy
more restrictive.

The concern for self-govemance
is a legitimate one, and the fear ofa
conspiracy may also be legitimate. I
am not inside Tom Crady’s head so i
cannot tell for sure, though I myself
have seen no strong evidence to that
would lead to believe this dteory.
Grinncll's current alcohol policy is
extremely lenient compared with
other schools, and iB' enforcement
on a loophole in the federal legisla»
tion, The administration has ex-
pressed its' strong discontentwith the
current federal guidelines through
letters to the government.

i would argue that we simply
can’t afford to take the chance of not
reviewing our alcohol policy. Is our
self-govemance system so imponant
that we are willing to endanger milA
lions of dollars in federal funding that
enable Grinnell to function as an aca

demic institution? What if, as has
been suggested, we leave education
up to campus groups and do not seek
to pursue the opportunity to rewrite
our current policy so that student af-
fairs is responsible for greater educa-
tion? The Old Milwaukee and sexual
assault examples demonstrate the in»
capacity of campus groups to educate
us about the dangers of something so
dearly loved. Our education is com-
promised when we do not pursue all
the facts. We must allow ourselves to
be removed from the cesspool of ig»
norance.

In sum, our minds and our liveli»
hood are lessened when we refuse to
consider every possible course of ac-
tion, which is what we are doing ifwe
refuse to cast a critical eye on our
currentalcoholpolicy,evenifit with-
stands that criticism. Such a review
will enable us all to combine our
talents to consider every possible
change: a change in education, a
change in restriction outof necessity
or out ofconcem, or no change at all.

Gays: Comparing civil rights movements

by Howard Horn

in last week's S & B Ibrought up
the issue of homophobia, or the
broaderissue of themorality of homo/
bisexualityanduiemovementtomake
these groups a legal minority. Homo/
bisexuality is a controversial issue.
Many people have openly expressed
negativity towards these groups while
others have given suppon. Still othr
ers have been indifferent.

The ﬁght for rights for homo/
bisexuals in the 1990‘s and beyond is
this generation’s equivalent to Afri-
can—American’s struggle for civil
rights in the 1950’s and 1960's. I
have based this conclusion on prin-
ciples I have observed through his-
tory and careful analysis of present
circumstances. There are many ex»
amples to support this thesis, several
of which will be discussed in this
editorial.

Neither homo/bisexuals nor Af»

characteristics that separate them from
European-Americans. For this rea-
son, they suffered discrimination.
Homo/bisexuals are born with their
sexual preference, or they are homo/
bisexuals because of environmental
factors. No one is really sure what
factors determine sexual orientation.
Because homo/bisexuals have differ—
ent sexual preferences, they have also
suffered discrimination.

Discriminationagainsthomo/bi-
sexuality (as was discrimination
against blacks) is unconstitutional.
The Constitution guarantees equal
rights to all citizens. Unfortunately,
the Constitution is often ignored. it
took landmark Supreme Court deci-
sions like the 1954 Brown v. Board of
Education decision to help reverse
discrimination for African-Amen»
cans. Homo/bisexuals are citizens.
They pay taxes just like straight citi-
zens. Yet dc juro and de facto dis»
crimination still exist. Because a
people are gay or bisexual, they can
be discriminated against in the mili~
tary. Employers can refuse homo/
bisexuals jobs, and the homo/bisexual
would have little legal recourse. Per-
haps a more liberal Supreme Court
(oraSupreme Court that understands
the Constitution) could provide
America with another Brown v. Board
of Education that would again SLl’lkC
down unconstitutional laws.

Both Ihecampaign forcivil rights
and the campaign for homo/bisexual
rights have suffered unjust popular
opposition from the political right.
GeorgeWallace,avocalleaderagainst
civil rights in the late 1960’s, ran for
presidentin order to protect the rights
of whites. Today. we have Rev. Pat
Robertson, a man who openly contra-
dicted the Constitution at the Repub-
lican National Convention when he
criticized gay rights and lifestyles.

Now that we have seen the corre-
lation between the two struggles for

rights, we must realize this infonna-
tion will draw further parallels for the
future. We should expect...

1) the struggle for rights for
homo/bisexuals to be long and difﬁ-
cult Itwill taken loioftime to show
government the light and will take
even longer to show the light to much
of society. African-Americans are
still ﬁghting the battle against dis-
crimination.

2) the struggletobeviolent. Gay
bashing is becoming more common
with the increase of rights for people
wiui alternative lifestyles. It will
only get worse oetorc it gets better.

3) great leaders to emerge. In
this respect, homo/biscxuals are dif-
ferent than African-Americans be»
cause the former can hide their being
a minority through “being in the
closet." Strong homo/bisexual lead-
ers must“come out” and be bold and
vocal. Homo/bisexualsmustfind their
own Martin Luther King, Thurgood
Marshall, or Malcom X.

4) great leaders to die for what
they say. This was perhaps the sad-
destpartofthe civil rights struggle of
the 1950’s and ‘60’s. Hatred is still
strong for minorities in white su-
premacy groups.

5) government to be more pro
gressive than society.

6) America to finally realize the
errors of its ways. Today we have
African/American business cxecu»
tives, govcmors,scnators,and judges.
Someday, these positions Will also be
filled by “out of the closet” homo/
bisexuals.

And hopefully one day, the
thought of having a black, gay, bi-
sexual, or female president will be no
more disturbing to mainstream soci-
ety than the ihoughtofhaving a presi-
dent who is white, straight, and male.
When this happens, we, as Ameri-
cans, can ﬁnally put discrimination
behind us.

Wasliburn

Each week in the 5&3 we
are confronted with Mike
Washbum‘s “common sense“.
A column that regularly ad;
dresses issues that insult the
minority groups in our college.
Is this an attempt on his part to
educate the campus or is it a
deep scared need for attention,
who knows?

Regardless of his motiva-
tion Mikc Washburn is the
epitome of the ‘ugly Ameri-
can'. In his last article he as
sorted that the United States is a
country where one can obtain a
“decent future" and that black
Africahasnosuchquality. Does
he look at the comparative cul-
tural richness of each society,
thepeopleorthelanguage7Nol
He can only fathom statistics.
two dimensional ideas that, on
theirown,merelytouchthe edge
of what we deﬁne as human
beings. And it is such a shame
that the copius amounts of time
he puts into background re
search is wasted. When all he
canextract is that“isolated case
A"p1us “isolated case B"equals
“generalization C“. He insults
the students body. from all po-
litical stands with his simplistic
and child»like reasoning.

To take matters further.
whose“common sense” is it? it
certainly can’t be his. For his
column is simply a collection
of data and quotes strung to-
gether with the vacuous drivel
that eloquently flows from his
pen. So, when it contes to the
crunch, if someone rebuts an
argumnont, he replies by say—
ing "i didn't say that" or “he
made it tip."

in last week's column we
also had the honor of seeing
him at his very best, when he
was backed into a comer by
Papa Owustt reply to a former
article. As a result, Washbum
resorted to petty insults: refer-
ring to Owusu as a "six foottall
infant" or using Owusu‘s ap»
parent " grammatical blunders"
as educated reasoning.

A majority of the student
body has had enough of
Washbum's supposed insights
of what we all seem apparently
blind to. I advocate freedom of
speech and Mike Washbum has

asamembcrofthcstudentbody
who contributes to the produc-
tion of the Scarlet & Black, I
want to read articles of sub-
stance. Washbum, you insult
the intelligence of your reedr
ers!
