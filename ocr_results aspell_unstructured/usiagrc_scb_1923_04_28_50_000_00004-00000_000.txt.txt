The Music of the Spheres

Just what the music of the spheres is like no
one knows, but the nearest approach to it is the
music of a Symphony Orchestra. There’s
nothing else like it on earth.

The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra plays next
Friday—one Week from today. In. point of
population Grinnell is the smallest city on its
tour, but we aren’t small in other things.

Are we?

Have you heard of Delilah? She was a tele-
brated vamp who lived about 400 B. G, The
most effective piece of work she did was on,
Samson, the strong man of his time. Delilah
made long hair unpopular in that neighborhood
foil quite a While.

Delilah’s artful wiles, and the harmonies that
made Samson’s hair stand on end, are part of
the symphony program Friday evening. When
you hear‘this song, and the seductive tintinnab-
ulations of the orchestra that go along with it,
you will understand why Samson fell for
Delilah.

Louis Symphony Orchestra come to Grinnell

sand percent in relief from trouble, relaxation
from care, and joyful memories for all the rest
of your life.
