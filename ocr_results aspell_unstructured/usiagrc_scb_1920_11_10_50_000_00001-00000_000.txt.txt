Allowed To Attend
Legion Fete.

Dean John Nollen, who spent near-
and

1y two years on 'the Italian
French fronts as Red Cross and Y. M.
C. A. director during the war, will
\give the Armistice Day address at the
regular chapel period tomorrow

Herrick chapel. He will describe

in

scenes on the French and Italian

trams on November 11 two years ago.

This will be the only celebration in
which the college Wlll take part. Col-
lege authorities have not given pet's
mission to attend the Armistice Day
dance given by the local American Lo.

, gion post. saying that it is a public
dance, and comes on a week night,
both of which mak/c it against the, Cole
Tegc regulations as far as college
students are concerned

The town celebration at the big
Norris sale pavilion has been widely
atlyertised, and is scheduled to be a
gay affair. People from all over the
County have signified their intention
ot attend, Legion men from this dTSv

. trict will be there in a body, accord
ing to commanders of the Foeht—Ten-
nan: post. The following statement
has been issued by officers of the
Gl‘innell Post:

November eleventh, 192‘], is the
Second anniversary of the signing of
the Armistice, which marked the close
of the great world war. It is a day
the memory of which, should be kept
alive in the hearts of the American
people by. fitting commemoration of
the sacrifice of those who gave their
lives to this great cause.

We believe that the day should be
set apart to teach to the people of our
nation the lessons of patriotism and
loyalty to DurTConstitution and Gon

ernmeht, as brought out through the

sacrifices of these young men.

It is deemed inadvisable that this
community give the entire day of No—
vémber eleventh, 1920, as a tribute to
the memory of those who have made
this supreme sacrifice. However, it
is believed that some fitting ceremony
should be observed on this day.

Therefore, we .suggest that the
church hells of the city he tolled from
10:55 a. m. to 11:00 a. m. and that all
activities cease from 11:00 a. m. to
11:01 a. m. wherever practicable, as
a fitting tribute to those who gave
their lives in the world war.

Further, we suggest that all ex-
service men stand at attention facing
the West, for this minute, as a tribute
to their former comrades, who have

.“gone West".

“EURDPE NEEDS NEW
HEART NDT RAIMENT"

Steiner speaks Before Capacity
Crowd at Orchestra Hall
in Chicago.

(Special to the Scarlet and Black)

Ch ago, Nov. (i.—Dr, n, A. Steiner
of G llnell college, Grinncll, Iowa,
addressed four thousand people who
crowded Orchestra Hall to capacity,
last night. The subject of his address
was "A New Heart for an Old World.“

"what Europe needs more than
food or raunent is a new heart," said
Dr. Steiner. He pointed out that
Europe had suffered from ilupcrial-
ism. distrust and .racial hatreds.
There can he no league of nations
until their is truth between govern-
nlnts he declared.

Dr. Steiner has addressed Sunday
night meetings in Orchestra Hall be-

DRINNEll PLAYERS
JDIN DRAMA lEADUE

Nearly One Hundred Members In\
Local League chapter — To
Advaidce Drama.

The Grinllell players joined tllel
Drama League of America at their‘
regular meeting Tuesday evening.
They will work in cooperation wltb‘
the town chapter of the Drama
League whlch was organized a felt
u ecks ago, when Mrs. A. Sta - Best,
vicoeprcsident oi the League, spoke
in ovulnell.

The addition of the thirty—eight
Grinnell Players to the Glinnell chap—
ter,of the League, makes the total
membership here close to one llunr
dred. One of the most significant
features of the Players entrance into
the League is the fact that it unites
the school and the town in a move-
ment for connnunity growth.

Organized in 1910, the Drama
League of America made splendid
progress along lines which should in»
tercst anyone who believes in com—
muuity welfare work. Its members,
numbering today several hundred
thousand people, believe that the only
way to crowd out the vicious or
worthless play is to create a desire
for clean wholcsomc drama, and then
lo increase the facility for the produc—
tion and witnessing of such dramas.

The otticial organ of the League is
“Drama", probably the most authori—
tivc monthly dramatic review. Last
year this m gazme published Seven-
teen plays suitable for production by
amateur casts. A number of secre—
taries are employed by the League,
whose duty it is to give advice to or-
ganizations to school, churches or
community ‘as to the production of
plays, and pageants

MEET HERE SATURDAY

Finish on Ward Field Preceding
Simpson Game—Amos Doped
for Honors.

Two events of considerable import-
ance are scheduled for Ward ﬁeld Stit—
urday afternoon. The annual game
between Simpson college and Griuneil
and the Missouri Valley cross country
run are the events of interest. Al-
though tbe Simpson game has no bear-
ing on our standing in the Missouri
valley it will be a bar -fought game
owing to the rivalry between the two
schools.

The cross country run will have six
of the Valley schools on its starting
list. Director Huff has stated that
Ames, Kansas University, Kansas Age
gies, Missouri. alld Nebraska have en-
tered teams. Ames, last year's will-
ncr, may be expected to show up well
and make a strong bid for tbc.lneet.
Nebraska is also supposed to have a
team of considerable strength with the
southern section of the conference.

Grinncll's team is as yet untried in
big competition and for that reason it
is impossible to forecast our chances.
But Captain Reece won the home
meet handily and because of his strong
finish it is likely that he will be able
to cut down his time considerably.

vCushmun, Daugherty, Higlcy and Mc-

Elderry will probably be his team-
mates Saturday.

The start of the cross country /run
is set for,2:30, the runners covering
the ﬁve mile grind, with a ﬁnal lap
around the track ﬁnishing ill from ot
the bleachers just before the start or
the Simpson battle.

EAST MEETS WEST m »

DRINNELL SAYS GUEST

Mrs. Lyman Powell Compares Us
With Eastern Colleges —
Likes Traditions.

“You are very fortunate in having
Grinnell new in the middle West for
it otfcrs the best in everything that
the eastern colleges have to give,"
said Mrs. Lyman Powell who has been
the guest of the college the past week,
in an interview granted yesterday.
Mrs. Powell went on to say that Glme
poll has the same kind of traditions.
the same high ideals of service, of
good scholarslnp, and of honesty, and

ght college teaching as
the eastern schools. Quoting kipling,
“East is cast, and west is west. and
ne'er the twain shall meet," Mrs.
Powell said that here the two had met
for the best oi the eastern traditions
and ideals were united with the dcm—
ucraoy and enthusiasm of the west.
“1 know more than one eastern col—
lege that would like to have your
campus with its beautiful luliltlings‘
and wondcrtul trees. 1 was Meryl
much surprised and delighted when‘
1 First saw the campus.”

oil-ls Oltlcr in host

Grinnell is a college with a cultural
ideal, which values the spirit as well
as the matcrial things of life. Tllc
chief difference between Grinllell and
tile eastern schools is that the girls
there are older. Most oi them come
there from boarding schools while tlte
girls here come direct from high
schools and the boarding school ex-
perience tends to more girls seem
old .

Mrs, Powell emphasized the fact
that every student needs to take a
personal interest in the endowment
campaign in order to make it success
mi and that every man and girl
should lcarn the needs of the college
should boost the movement. They
and should do their share to help sc—
cure funds. In a mass meeting of the
girls at the Quadrangle tonight she
will present her suggestions for the
work here at Gllnnell.

at the hands of the Coc collcge grid~
sters at Cedar Rpalrls last Saturday,
14 to o .

Owing to the condition of the grid—
iron neither team was able to employ
open play. Any attempt at forward
passes resulted in failure because of
the water soaked ball. Both teams
resorted to straight football and a.
kicking duel resulted between Pence
of Coe and Marklcy, of the Pioneers.
Honors were about evenly divided be-
tween the two punters, Coe baring an
advantage during the first half, with
Markiey out pulltiug Pence dllrlng the
last half of the game.

Both of the cue touchdowns result-
ed from blocked pllnts. lilarkley being
unable to get them under way quick
enough owing to his insecure footing.
With Coe one touchdown ahead at the
end of the first half the gap was too
great for Grinucll to bridge and atter
the two teams \hatl played on even
terms until the last tew minutes of
play, Coe scored another touchdown
and kicked goal. The hall bit the
crossbar out bounced over. making
the kick good.

It was a sad blow to Grinuellrhopes,
for statistics show that Coe outplayed
the Pioneers. The work of the locals
against Drake caused Scarlet and
Black supporters to feel that the team
was hitting its pace in 'the fullest
sense of the word, but mey did not
look like the same aggregation at
Coe.

Grlnllell fans who witnessed the
garlic were quick to admit that the
team which won played the best foot-
ball, but they just as quickly cone
demned the brand of sportsmanship
which was evident on the sidelines.
