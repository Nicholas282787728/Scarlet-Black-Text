was named vice President tor
Development in 1975. Before then, he
was president oi international House

served in front of the Forum, Soon,
people begin arriving on central cam-
pus to paint the sidewalks and each
other. SGA oiticials periodically ap-
pear with white bags full of toys
(bubbles, paddle-balls, balloons,
chalks, and paintst tor the par
ticipants.

Kegs are on tap, provided by dona-
tions collected in the dinning halls.
The afternoon air is filled with the
music of the Frozen Nose Band, Nick
Cowie’s band, the 5&T, the Celestial
Sacred Harp Singers, and several
other jazz hands.

Alas, even with all or these outside
diversions, the professors I spoke wtth
reported that nearly all of their
classes were 30-50% lull. SGA Presi-
dent David Kramer admits, “I'm real-
ly disappointed that a lot oi students
didn’t participate in Skip Day,”

Kramer feels that students who
worry about missing a class or getting
behind do not understand the true in
ner workings of Skip Day.

“It nobody goes to class, there is no
class," he asserts, “so if nobody went,
nobody would get behind."

“At some point in the afternoon, one
at the bands played a song, He’s a
Nerd,’ 'Kramer continues, “that pretty
well typifies almost all or the people
who went to class.”

There were mixed reactions among
the faculty to this second unofficial
Skip Day, Several professors canceled
classes, changed test dates, made labs
optional, and generally made it easy
for their students to enjoy Skip Day in
the intended spirit.

Other professors held class, and ad-
mitted that they would give “brownie
points" (sometimes in the form of ex-
am questions) to the students who
came to Class. There were even a lew
scattered cases oi profs (ie. martyrs)
lecturing to one student [or the entire
period.

Reportedly, several prots complains
ed that the amount of noise on Central
campus was disrupting their classes,
to which Kramer replied, “That’s
greatl”
