Confidence needed

Wednesday night, Senator John
Culver appropriately concluded
the United States-European
Conference by assessing the iuture
oi democracy, Not unexpectedly,
('tllver asserted the basic stability
of thc American constitutional
system and the soundness oi the
Atlantic Alliance. He did not.

prime minister resigned, in
Germany where the president
resigned: and at
Vietnam. Watergate, revelations
of C.1.A, activities, and the grain
scandals. Without glossmg over the
bad, Culver emphasized the moral
strength oi the American people as
sutlicient to withstand the
challenges. .

gloriiy America, though the
bicentennial was mentioned
several times. However, Culver
rererred to concern by Europeans
over whether Americans are
resigned to the presence of Com-
munism in Europe and have lost
the will to counter that presence.

i agree with Senator Culver in
believing that Americans have not
lost their selt»contidence. Un~
iortunately, though, Americans
are disenchanted over domestic
problems. Young Americans are

of such ideas.

The hope at thi crucial Junction
in ioreign pol' is the or.
lectiveness of the liberal response.
Cillvcr’s speech is a line example
of the alternatives available to the
American people. The
traditional measure of defense by
adding up stockpiles is woefully
deceitful and damaging to
American life.

The true defense of any society
must be the measure oi its quality
of life. Americans must demand
from their government the return
oi a sane domestic program which
provides for all people and tor the
maintenance of adequate defenses.
in conducting toreign policy,
Americans must rely on detente
and seasoned dialogues, or else
live in a hollow wasteland where
munition is the prime source of
production.

Today. the direction of American
democracy is shitting, The bubble
of the American innocence has
been pricked. We are not the most
holy and righteous people on earth.
Our government is morally neither
exceptionally superior nor interior
to others of the past. We caused
death in Vietnam. We have sup-
pressed nationalist movements in
the world. But, as mature citizens
of the United States, we must
recognize our strengths in the
democratic tradition. Most of all,
we must, learn to temper our ac~
lions abroad with the wisdom of
history and at home with sen-
sitivity.
