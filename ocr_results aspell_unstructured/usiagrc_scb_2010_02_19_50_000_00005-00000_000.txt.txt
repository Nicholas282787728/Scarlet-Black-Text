The community garden may be lying dormant under several feet
of snow, but support for the local foods movement is coming into
ﬁlll bloom.

The Grinnell Student Garden has been around for sevelal years,
but the Grinnell Community Garden started just last year when
Jordan Scheihel’095, Caitlin Vaughan ’10 and three other Grirmrll
Students won a Sanh Boyer ’08 community Servioe Award.

The GI-innell Cultivating Community, as the student collective
deeded to call themselvesueceived $3,000 to spend the summer cree
aiing a Community Garden in Miller Parlc located next to Nyanza
lake at the southernmost tip or High Street. “We worked all sum»
met to get the community involved and to get our produce into the
hands of those who wanted it and needed it,"Vaughan said.

In addition to basic gardening duties, cultivators sold their pro-
duce at the Grinnell Farmers Market, partnered with the Galaxy

This spring the Grinnell Area -Local Foods Alliance
(GALFA) rerconvened for the ﬁrst time in three years both to
recognize the'mobilization of the local foods movement in the
Grinnell college community and to serve as a forum for local
producers, consumers and eaters.

"The purpose ofGALFA Is to promote awareness of, and
use of, locally produced food In the Gri’nnell community, saId
GALFA rounder Jon Andelson Anthropology. The organiza-
tion Is highly community focused and aims also to be commu-
nity, as opposed to institutionally, driven,“[GALl-‘A] Is more or
an iniormal group wirh producers, buyers and eaters,” Andela
son said.

It Is precisely GALFA's purview to bring diversc groups of
people with a uniryIn'g interest In local foods together, which
makes the re inVIgoration of the organization so important.

“The stake holders involved [in GALFA] are anybody from
people workIng In .rhc government, to professors and people
want to eat healthy food, to Kamal [Hammounda] at the Phoer
nit Care,to student groups on campus," Kayla Koether'lz said.

Each ofthe stake holders have something valuable to corn
tribute to the local foods movement. GALFA exists, according
to Audelsonﬂin to support existing Initiatives and to promote
new initiatives." ,

In addition to the implications GALFA will have on stu-

DinIng Services Indeed, as awareness rises about the beneﬁts
ofeating locally, Grinnell students quickly turn to their local

Scheibel and Vaughan agreed that providing ﬂesh food for those
who would be otherwise unable to afford it is one of their biggest
goals. “I think one or the reasons that people In the country and
in Poweshiek County are racing diabetes and obesity and other ail-V
ments is lack ofgood nutrition, ClﬂgVaughan said.

Community gardens grow more than food, and true to their
name, community is one of their most beneﬁcial crops. “1 think that
community gardens can create a really nice space for communities to

come together over something that almost everyone loves which is

Due to last sumn'aefs success the Wilson fellowship will ﬁmd
two community n coordinators to continue the work of the

to change the way Grinnell community eats '

ningispeciﬁcally with the annual GALFA summer intern.

Despite the dining services’ enthusiasm that GALFA has
restarted, there are concerns, “One thing that concerned me
when we went to this last GALFA meeting was that the room
was full but it was full of students and buyersinot growers,"
said Assistant Director or Grinnell Dining services Terry Wal-
tersdorr, who Is involved In purchasing. For GALFA to bc er—
fective we need to have growers.

Both VValtersdorf and Director of Grinnell Dining Dick
Williams point out that regardless ofDining Services wIlling»
ness and desire to provide local foods, financial and logistical
factors get in the wayThey cite competition with other illsfltur

' lionsisuch as Iowa State University—as an issue, "Food is just

not out there In quantities, ”said Williams. Everyone’s lining
up to do this but there arent enough growers 'to provide the
supply.

Another liInitatIou facing Dining Services budget. {Some
or the growers would be wIlling to grow everything we need but
at it cost that's probably above what we can do," said Associate
Director ofDining Semces Jeanette Moser. “Typically because
it's organic,"

Seasonality is also a factor, smcc Dining Services' main
months of operation are in the winter monms when regional
availability is IimIrcd.The Dining Hall deﬁnes “local" as being
wrthm an SS-mile radius, although according to Williams they
do “swing out of that a little bit."

If students are truly dedicated to eating locally they will
have to make sacriﬁcesiwhich may be easier said than done,
“HI don't have bananas down there right now I get yelled at,"
said Waltersdorf.

but Dining services is Iinding ways around these road-
block57and they may be making a big announcement very
soon, “They're looking to make an agreement with a runner to
grow speciﬁc things for us.” and Moser. Williams einphasned
that nothing has yet~been conﬁrmed. ~

GALFA is dedicated to-supporting the kinds ofrelation—
ships between consumer and producer which would allow the
dining hall to stock more local food. “I do want to give [the dine
Ing hall] credit for as much as they have done and give them err
couragement and support for doing even more,"Andelson said,

In addition to engaging and supporting the Grinnell Col-
lege community as regards local roods, GALFA also aims to aid
local farmers—most importantly, at the logistical level.

' One of the difﬁculties which arises for local famers is the
impossibIlity or both rarmIng and marketing, when both are
full time jobs. GALFA aims to alleviate some of this pressure
by producing pamphlets and bulletins advertising local grower
aud their crops to local buyers. Additionally, GALFA has begun
work, with the Iovwr Valley Resource Conservation and Devel-
opment (RC&D) on centralizing the processing aspects oflocal
farming,

“We’ve been talking about cold storage and light process
ing facilities for flVK: years... our alliancc with the Iowa Valley
RCStD might be the way we‘re going to make that happen,"
Audelson said.

Providing this kind ofservice at the local level would allow
farmers to store crops for longer and also process them in the
ways many institutional buyers, like Grinnell College's dining
services and the Grinncll public school system, generally [6*

mm.
q This move to bring so many diverse, autonomous groups
together might not be easy, but it certainly bears potential for
innovation driven by a cohesive movement.

“I think we stop paying attention to where we are and by
extrapolation stop caring for it," said Andelson. “In the case of
rood, and In the case particularly orIowa, we have such an op
portunity to use locally produced t’ood. Iowa has something like
a quarter of the grade—A farmland In the United States, the soil
here Is phenomenally rich, and yet Iowa imports 80 percent of
its foodThere’s something wrong with that."
