Desiree Armfeldt and lawyer
Fredrik Egennan. old flames who
are dissatisﬁed with their current
lovers. Kathy Henson’s portrayal
of Desire leaves nothing to be de-
sired. Her strong stage presence,

SCARLET & BLACK

Really great campus
bands play Skip Day

By Todd Erler

"Out of pain comes music," I
once heard someone say. it that
statement is true then pain must be
abundant at. Grinnell. There is
enough pain to wan-ant the exist-
ence of at least six campus bands
who are playing at this year's Skip
Day.Whoarcihcsemadmusicians?

Orion

Playing a mix ofblucs and hard
rock, Orion is the unofficral
"soundcheck band" tor Skip Day.
The band, composed olKeyln Gor-
don on lead guitar, Glen Knuckols
on rhythm guitar, Mo Cox on bass,
Aki Toyota on dmms and Dorje
Gumngon vocals, playscovets Led
Zepplin, AC/DC, and Ozzy
Ozboume.

Nola funny name. nota serious
name, just a solid name," says
Kevin, explaining how the band
chose its name, "Wherever I go,
Orion is there."

Molten Death

At midnightMolten Death gath-
ers at KDIC to broadcast, The band
includes Corkscrew of Death on
the guitar. Murderous Scruir the
harmonica player, the "lead
sereamer" Unnecessary Violence.
Death Burger on the tmmbone, a
pereussionistnamed DeathPelsoni-
fled, and Tone Donut, who plays
the baroque recorder

This Heavymetal-Reggae-New
Age band are anydling but oonvene
Lional. Reclining around the radio
station they tell me about their vi»
sion.

"Weliketothinkofourselvesas
the unpleasant people of New Age
music," says Murderous Scruff.

"We would have been the bad
boys of heavy metal " adds Unnec-
essary Violence, "but not all of us
are boysi"

Theirmusical inﬂuences include
Death Tongue, Lawrence Welk,
John Denver. and the More Lunch
for Lampxeys ladio can. They ex—
plained that as a band they felt
spiritually connected to the lam-
preys eating habitof sucking blood
from larger animals,

Green Eggs and Ham

What does the band Green Eggs
and Ham play? "Women’s music,"
says Greg Vincent, the foursomes
guitarist, With the voice of Heather
Hein'ibuch on vocals who is sur—
prised'.7

The band, including Fritz
Gundlach on drums and Ryan
Bahrey on bass, plays covers of
10,000 Maniacs, the Indigo Girls.
Michelle Shocked, and Sinead
O’Conner and a long-winded ren-
dition of "Gloria“ by the Kinks.

According to Greg, the band
"started when Heather found me
playing guitar in the stairwell in
Main."

Corduroy

"Each of us had a dream sepa-
lately, in the same week, to be in a
rock band," says Brian Tester about

the beginning of the band Cordu-
roy, This Meat Puppets and Dino-
saur I r. inﬂuenced band consists of
Brian, Dan Sharp and John
Siqveland on guitar and bass, and
George the drummer,

Although their moslnotcd song,
"Space Cup", is a funk tune, they
maintain utat they are not a funk
band. With lyrics like "Come on
and lay your funky hands on me.
and funk riff thatcan last foragood
forty-ﬁve minutes, it is easy to see
utatutissong is appreciatedby their
audiences.

Explaining the origin of the.
band‘s name, Brian says, "When
you were in eighth grade and your
mom was sttll buying clothes for
you, she would get you those tan
corduroy trousers, You‘d have to
walk to school in them. Thatswlsh~
ing noise was sort of annoying but
at the same time was really familiar
and comforting. You know? Plus
it‘s kind oia nice wor

HAMMER

I track down Elisa Martin, the
manager of the band HAMMER in
the SGA offices. She explains that
the band plays hard rock and heavy
metal covers oi Mctallica, Rush,
Led Zepplin, and Eric Johnson.
"They where thinking oreovenng a
Nelson song," she says, "but they
vanquished that idea."

The band members are guitarist
Mau DeCeunynk, drummer Chris
Jackson, singer Rob lahrling and
Josh Burke on the bass guitar,

"Actually this is the third gen-
eration of this band," Elisa says,
“Two yeals ago they were a band
called Fifth Force, then last year
they were DeadWeighL“ Sheseems
certain the band will carry on even
when mis year‘s members gradu-
ate.
The band has hopes of playing
off campus, in town andinAmes. "i
told them I would take them as far
as I could.“ Elisa says.

Shrinkidink

With thenoise oftl'iemovieFlth

Barak Weinstein, and Chris Iardine
tell meabout the band Shrinkldink.
The band is country—iunk—progres-
sive, "0n the cutting edge," adds
Christ All their music is wrilen by
the band. which also includes An-
drew Seagren and Jeremy
Hawkinson.

"Commercials," says Charles
whenIaskwhatanislically inspires
them. "Oscar Mayar was a big in
ﬂuence,"

Sixcampusbands,plusthelong—
awaited reunion ol‘Shur-Fineieliy,
a Greatful Dcadish band, in one
place (Harris) is more music than
one can shake a stick at However,
Ihave to wonder: can the campus
hold this much art? Is there a feel-
ing of competition between the
bands? Perhaps a bit, but if it gels
out of hand, Molten Death has a
solution to the problem, "Bring out
the lampreysi "
