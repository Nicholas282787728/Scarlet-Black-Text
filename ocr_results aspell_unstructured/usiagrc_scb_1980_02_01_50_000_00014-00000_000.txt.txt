Return from the ‘Real World’

Lately I’ve felt so tired I think I‘ve
“O.D.'d” on The Grinnell Experience;
three years of loud music, spilled beer,
all-nighters, renovations,. ad-
ministrative shakeups, reserve
readings, deadlines, meetings, lees
tures, movies, rehearsals, workshops,
concerts, and heavy conversations with
people have lelt me exhausted and
drained. Somewhere between
September oi my ireshman year and
second semester oi my junior year
Grinnell turned from a tun new ex-
perience into a sensory overload.

A lot of things that people do that only
mildly annoyed me three years ago now
iniuriate me: throw iood, play music at
2:00a.m,. shout out during movies, kick
‘holes in walls, tell oft-color, sexist jokes
(“C'mon, we're just kidding .why are
you so attendedY”), vandalize artwork.
sit silent durlng class discussions (or

swings in Merrill Park; swim: llslen to
music; write letters: take a study
break and run irom my room over to
the Forum, buy one ot those big
chocolate chip cookies, run back to my
room, and EAT IT,

July . Two months now since i came
to Cambridge. So much goes on here. It
takes a lot of energy to do all the things
I want to: hit all the shops and
restaurants, catch the first-run movies,
take in events at Harvard, {lnd and en-
]oy local musicianSVLhings that Grin-
nell just didn't offer It takes more
energy to do those things 1 don't want to
do: work 9 to 5 and come home, worn
out, to a roommate who chats at m.
cessantly, deal with late or nonexistent
public transportation, buy groceries.
pay the bills and the rent, step over
drunks lying on the street, dodge
crazies and shopping-bag ladies, try
tunsuccessiullyl to sleep through the
noise oi the dumpster outside my will~
dow at the crack 01 dawn, pick my way

‘Can’t stop thinking of everyone baclt

at Grinnell and of all that l’m missing.

I often wish I was there

monopolize them), shoot oil tire ex-
tinguishers, rip oti albums irom KDIC.
crillcize Food Service endlessly—I’m
so sick of it all, Sick of inseparable
couples who break up and then won‘t
speak to each other; oi having to work
to get a conversation going with a new
acquaintance; oi pretending I‘ve read
all 500 pages when I’ve only read 50.
April » l-lave decided it's going to take
more than a summer vacation to kick
this jaded, intolerant feeling I have
about Grinnell. It's important for me to
always want to come back here,
because I do love it as a total entity. So
l'm going to take next semester oft and
check out the world outside Iowa. It‘ll
be good to meet some older, more
stimulating, more considerate people.
Lately I've been spending more time
by myseli, and less time running
around and trying to be on top of all
that's happening, 1 ieel unsustained by
my friendsithey just aren’t there ior
me anymore. There've been too many
times when they didn’t iollow through,
didn’t show up, didn't reciprocate my
friendship. They‘re notas supportive as
I wish they were. So i do those things
that can be enjoyed alone: ride a bike
out in the country; swing on those great
