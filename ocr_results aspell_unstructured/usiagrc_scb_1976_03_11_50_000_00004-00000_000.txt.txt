eariy season loss to Norris A by

Rachel Obermiller, Swim Coach
Ray Obermiller's wife, told a
caller that she had a premonition
last Saturday afternoon that the
men’s swim team would not win
the conference title. The
premonition proved correct as
Knox successfully defended its
conference title by edging out
Grinnell 393-379 in the meet at
Appleton, wise, Five first places
weren’t enough to give Grinnell the
title, despite a 206-201 lead over
Knox at the end of the first day.

John Chambers started off the
first day by winning the 400 yard
individual medley in a conference
and a school record time of
4:34.559, with teammate Frank
Halley placing third-Chambers set
a school record with a mark of
56.255 in the [DD butterﬂy, but
finished second to defending
champion Mike Muro of Knox. Bert
Simpson finished third behind
Chambers in that event. Bruce
Jones garnered second in the zoo
backstroke while Bruce Murch
placed sixth,

The score was 3048 at the half in
favor of Read. but in the second
half Langan came out gunning.
The men from Langan led most of
the second half and only a late
surge and then a stall enabled
Read to capture the Latimer Cup,
long symbolic of 1M excellence,

My thanks to Tom Latimer and
all the basketball players who
made the season such a success.
Special thanks go out to the
referees who put up with the
harassment directed their way
throughout a very long season.

won the [DO breastroke in school
record time of i: .722. John
Roberts took a surpr ing ninth
place in that event, Grinnell was
further surprised in the required
diving as Norm Zimmerman
placed third and Ric Day sixth.

The no free relay unit of
Chambers, Halley, Simpson, and
Doug Johnson set a school record
w‘th a time of ‘36356. while
finishing second. Johnson com-

respectively, and placed fifth in the
100 free, while Chris Col-ton took
fourth. Finishing the first day as it
had begun, Grinnell set a con-
ference and a school record in the
400 medley relay. Combining for a
time of . .575 were Jones, Olson,
Simpson, and Corton.

The Second day saw Jones win
the 50 free in 23.207, while Cotton
sprinted to third. Alter ﬁnishing
sixth in the 200 free Johnson came
back to place the same in the 200
IM, while Olson was seventh.
Zimmerman pulled no surprises in
winning the optional diving with a
total of 277.41, While Day was tenth.

Despite a school record time of
2:05.134 Chambers finished third in
the 200 fly, with Simpson placing
seventh. Jones and Murch com-
bined for third and fifth in the 100
backstroke, while Halley and Olson

All those involved in the running
of last Week’s indoor track meets

exhaustive stint lasting from, " ’10
am. to a pm. First the women
in the Grinnell Women’s Ins
vitational and then the men hosted
the Midwest Conference meet,

seven team invitational with 27
points. Graceland won the meet
with 62 points. The Pioneers t
no firsts, but Chris Stidley and

flew through the air a distance of
317%". The Women took three
fourths and tour fifths, as well.

In the men's conference meet no

yard dashes no Pioneer individual
or relay team placed higher than
third. Mike Nadalsky and L' ' in
