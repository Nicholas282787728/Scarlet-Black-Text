Battling Pioneers Sink To Strong Vikings, 21-13

A determined Pioneer team,
lacking a barricade against the’
passing attack of Lawrence,
emerged from its Centennial home-l
coining contest Saturday trailingl
the Vikings 21-13. l

First break of the game went,
to the winners in the for-m at
a fumble on the Griririell 22 yard
line when Herb White failed tol
get off a punt and Lawrcnecl
gained the ball on downs. The en-
suing Viking drive got no farther-
than the Grinnell 17 yard'liire.‘
A Grinneh punt out of danger;
was taken by Viking star

Grimm"! goal.

Henry Hoopes, Grinnell end,
recovered, a Viking fumble early

the second quarter. Jack Mc-
Kermit Steinbeck
sparked a 35 yard drive which
ended .with Steinbeck diving into
pay d . Ed Nagel failed to split
the uprights, and the half ended
with Lawrence leading 7-6.

Passes from Giordana to Burton
and Rodtke culminated in a sec-
ond Viking score during the last
'thl'ee minutes of the third quar-
ter. Dick Miller, tackle, got the
extra point on a place kick.

The last Viking touchdown came
via the air on a 67 yard march
climaxed by a heave from Gior-
dana to Burton who stood alone
in the end zone. Miller again
booted the point.

- teinbeck caught tli‘ next kick-
oft on his own 7 yard line and
dashed to the Lawrence 38 be-l‘
j’of'E'being downed. A few plays.
later Wehbt talked on a spinnerl
through the center. Jack Bredi-l
mus’ kick made the score 21-13.

The remainder of the contest
was played in Lawrence territory
until the final seconds when
From, Lawrence halfback, hit
Burton with a pass. Burton drove.
to the Grinnell 6 yard line be-
fore being knocked out of bounds,
but die game ended before
another play could be completed.

Grinncll will still be shooting
for its first conference win of the‘
season Saturday when the Pin-l
neers tangle with Cornell's Purplel
team at' Mount Vernon. Therel
has been no let-up in stiff prac-:
tices this week, despite the hard“
fought game with Lawrence, since‘
the Pioneers are determined to
win more than a ”moral” victory.‘
Ben Douglas has been
stressing pass defense after lapses
in this department probably cost
the Pioneers a victory over Lhel
league leading Lawrence team.

Grinnell will enter'the game
handicapped by several injuries
surfeied against Lawrence and in

earlier games. Grover stubbee,
giant 240 pound tackle, is probably
out of the Cornell game because
of a rib injury sustained in the
Lawrence game. Herb White who
has been regular end all season
will also be out with a stomach
disorder which may ben him for
the remainder of the se son. A1-
ready incapacitated fro earlier
injuries are Ev Sory, first end on
the squad, who was knocked out
of competition for the season
in Grinnell‘s first game with a
dislocated shoulder, and 0. Burns.
rangy end, whose dislocated el~
how has not yet gotten into shape.
To compensate for the critical sit-
uation at the wing posts Ed Na-
gelhstellar slashing fullback, may
see some ae'tion against the purple
after sitting out the Lawrence
game with a twisted kneee. ,
Pioneer hopes were dealt a
serious blow when Coach Doug-
las announced that Fred Webb.
Grinnell passing ace, probably.
would not start against Cornell
because of a bad cold. E. G.’
Booth, a promising freshman, will
fill the gap, The probable starting

lineup follow: ends, vanstrum and .
tackles, Mitchell and ‘

Mel White;
George Erb guards, Woodward
and Hebso , enter, Bowers; quar-
t‘erback, . Steinbeck; halibacks,
Booth and Southworth; fullback,

Nagei.

,only Rawson stands between

gglball. Dibble is second with two
whose-es; Gates and Smith are tied
4gl1‘ol’ thir .
13; “Uricivciitfiil” best describes this
ZlecCli‘s games. Gates managed to
26lsquecze out Cowles in an over-
511tinie; Smith in turn downed Gates
lby thc same method. Still another
overtime affair ended with Raw-
son topping Smith. Earlier in the
week, Dibble defeated
13-0. The surprise of the week
came in the Clark - Cowles con-
test which culminated in a 6-0
victory tor Cowles,

Two games remain in the 'sea-
son: Rawson vs, Cowles and Raw-
on vs. Laiigan. All eyes are upon
{elly's Stables; should tlicyrally
to Wm both contests, they would
tind themselves in a three way
tie for first place with Langan
and Dibble,

At stake in men's intramurals
are points toward the coveted
Gardner trophy. This award was
establvs‘ned in 1940 by Macliiii
Gardner, public relations man for
ego in the Chicago dis-
trict, and is awarded each year
to the hall accumulating the high-
est number of points during the
whole year’s schedule

These points, awarded for elev-
on sports and scholarship. are
earned as follows: the lowest team
in the league to complete its
schedule with no games forfeited
wins fifty points ,and for each
successive position above, twenty

iclarlt

points are added. In case of ties ‘

the points are split. Thus, if two
trams should tie for first place,
the points for first and second
would be equally divided between
the two.

In order to gain permanent
possession of the trophy. a hall
must win it three times in suc-
cession. The last time this trophy
was awarded was in 1543 to Dib-
blc Hall. Dibble also earned it in
19-12 and 1940. The only other
hall on the,canipus ever to merit
the award was Gates, who won it
in 1941.
