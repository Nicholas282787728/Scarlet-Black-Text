Tuesday evening at 6:30 the Girls' R

Glee Club gave their annual concert on

selves made a ver picturesque group,
as they sat, whiteclad, on the natural
stage, on the south campus.

The program comprised nearly all
or the old songs and some or the new
ones. The ﬁrst number was the old
but ever-popular- "Cdrlllcnzt Waltz." or
the other numbers the lndian Songs,
"The Land oi the Shy-blue Water," and,
“The White Dawn ls Stealino," ms
gather with Dvolzrk's “Lullall were
perhaps best received. Jessica Bur-
ton’s solo, "The Last Rose 0! Summer."
made its rrsual plaintive appeal to the
audience. The feature or the pro
gram was the prize song, written by
Ruth Suckow and Ruth Camphell,
which was rendered last night for the
ﬁrst time. Al. the close, the girls rer
sponded to the encore with their
Medley.

The concert brought llolncslt'lrness
to some hearts and joy to others. The
old Glee Club girls were halted back
to thoughts or their songslcr days,
and the nonmelodious alumni, were
listening to concerts at ﬁve, ten, and
twenty years ago. The girls themselves
feel that with this they have set the
seal to the close at an unusually sucr
cessful Glee Club year,
