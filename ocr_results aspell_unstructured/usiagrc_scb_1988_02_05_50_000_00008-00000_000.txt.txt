Record Release

by Thomas A. Beverly and
Eric A. Johnson

The album that got the most play
on my tape deck over break was
“Saturday," the newest release by
an Austin, Texas. outiit known as
the Reivel's. The Reivers are led
by singer/songwriter/guitarist
John Croslin, whose low, drawling
vocals, rumbling guitar and knack
ior melody give the band its consis
tent distinctive sound. The remain
ing lead and background vocals
are ably provided by guitarist Kim
Longacre and bassist Cindy Toth,
who , also oiier occasional
songwriting assistance. Croslin
weaves numerous themes into‘
“Saturday," beginning in the open-
ing song, “What Am 1 Doing": ”1
was a little bit scared/when l
iound out that everyone around
me/Knew as much nothing as 1,"
"Saturday" is an excellent iollow-
up to a 1935 release, “Translate

Burling Exhibit, Part I

by Vincent Prosser

This Exhibit (the iirst at two
parts) probably contains some oi
the most iinely cratted works oi art
that have appeared on campus
during my time here. But i'm
curious as to. what these works.

the art oi seeing or creating. My
difficulty with this kind of omnibus
exhibit is that 1 meet it, See it, and
am left with the question: What
could 1 possibly say that could be oi
any use to anyone (including
myself)? It. all has to do with the
way I react to art, 1 have what I
must admit is a very narrow taste
in art, and within its perimeters I
demand a kind of subtle. shaded.

A good example oi this reaction
is the duck piece by John Abbot in
this exhibit. Although i had greatly
admired its delicacy and coloring
in the exhibition catalog, 1 iound

attention and admiration. While
some oi the pieces seemed too

versely, too sketchy, I telt that the

Bright Lights, Big City

by Vincent Prosser

The most important trend in
publishing’s recent history is the
degree to which young, untried
authors are getting published, This
is die result oi new and innovative
publishing techniques, in England,
as discussed in the Economist,
poetry, or all things, is iinding
commercial success. This success
is due to publishers’ willingness to
commit themselves to large-scale
printings. thereby making new
poetry aiiordable. In America .
{inequality paperbacks are [ins
ding such success that many new
books are now published iirst in
paperback, then in hardback. The
new paperback market has an in
credible appetite ior new authors,
the hope being that among the
many who get published there will
be a new Hemingway or a new
Steinbeck. So ia ~, three oi the most
successiul young writers are Tama
Janowitz, Brett Eastcn Ellis, and
Jay Mcinerney 7 the “Brat Pack"
oi young writers. Hip. trendy, and
Tom Wolie - iniluenced. they are
story-tellers in nontraditional
iorm. For them, the “New Jour-
nalism" has become the “New

Henrys, they iocus ‘u‘p'o’n thé»‘city,

but without Henry's diversity,
Their attention centers on their
Own limited social milieu, Dr, in
Tama Janowitz’s case, on uncanr
vincing absurdist thrills. Jay
Mclnerney has been the most suc-
cessiul of the new writers, and I
would like to discuss the implicar
tions of his "Bright Lights, Big Ci-
ty,,"

Reaction to the book has run the
gamut irom critical acclaim to eX~
treme disgust. The acclaim came
from the usual praiseworthy things
7 line style, insight. beauty. But
the disgust caine irom more coma
plicated reactions to the work, in
the complicated reactions we see
the controversies that underline to»,
day's literary and social worlds,
The reactions of the harsher critics
are driven by two causes 7 the
critics' jealousy oi Mclnerney's
easy success, and the unease with
which they meet the now7
ascendant style at writing, The
yealousy may be seen in the
strength oi their criticism 7 sour
grapes lead them to yoyiully
pounce on Mclnerney's more re
cent writings, searching for Ilaws.

The current style oi writing is
tongudinwheek, ,full at throwaway

‘c'hi‘cf Mclneiiiey iill's his wo'rk'with

a plot oi extreme sentimentality,
but surely he cannot be serious.
The reader is being pandered to 7
in on the joke, he is meant to smile
at McInerney's winks and nods, A
lot oi critics dislike this — the
modern writing is no longer irank
enough ior them; it is playiul,
deconstructicnist, the literary
equivalent oi postmodern ar-
chitecture. The columnist James
Kilpatrick certainly dislikes such
writing. Furthermore, he dislikes
the moral leniency that the loose
structure oi the book implies.

The book glories in the loose
morals that it goes on to portray
specilically This is part oi the pres
blem ior some critics. in portray-
ing the protagonist snorting co-
caine and parading with various
unsavory characters, Mclnerney
reiers to him as “you," equating
the reader with the story's pro-
tagonist. That cannot have gone
over very well with some readers.
What Mclnerney tried was a kind
oi technical iireworks, While they
give the narrative a ieeling oi imr
medlacy on a iirst reading, the
tense and pointol'rview detract
irom iurther readings when the
reader already knows the out
come. The stylistic choices become

obviously heavyrhanded.
‘ Throughout, the book is marred
by such baggage. As a novel, it is
pretty thin stuff. The plot is
basically that a young man, disaps
pointed that his wife left him,
begins to follow a selfrdestructive
course, The characters and
dialogue never go much beyond the
surface. Were this book pure satire
.ol the Evelyn Waughrtype. it could
be much more successful — the
writer seems to have a talent for
absurdist satire, But the book
aspires to "moral truth," and
breaks down from the weight cl" its
ambitions. The final idea. that
warm, doughy bread has a power
for redemption. IS barely thought
out and lacks the charming, coma
ical dignity oi Flaubert’s parrot oi
Proust's madelaine, it is an empty.
hollow metaphor because the
reader, despite his having been .
equated with the story's pro-
tagonist, cannot see the brand’s
power ior redemption. Mclnerney
simply says that the bread has
redeeming power. but does not.
show us why. in the end, the book
iocuses only on the suriace oii
things, destroying the useiulness oi
metaphors, ior symbols must have -
meanings.
