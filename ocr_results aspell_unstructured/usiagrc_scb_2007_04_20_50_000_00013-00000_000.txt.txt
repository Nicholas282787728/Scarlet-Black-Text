Letter from
the Editors

When trying to think trfsonretlring
meaningful to say- to the campus community
nboln the trrgie events of this week, we were
at a loss. It’s hard to i he sense of things tlrlrt
seem so senseless. It's dil-iicult to find words
to talk about What we cannot wrap our herrtis
around.Thc sadness and gricfovcr ul’s death
was compounded by the tragedy at Vi binia
Tech. Receiving such hoirible news on such a
benutifnl spring dny felt so surrenl.

It’s natural to want answers and lessons
from rhc trngirdy ol‘n fellow students suicide.
Wt: look for waw to uncle tiuid it bee ise
dealing with such acute and collective pain can
feel incredibly overwhelming.

We’ve talked to students who are
ctperiericing guilt about Pillll’s death. But the
responsibility to make someone happy or to
keep someone nhve lies with no one person.
We've talked to students who weren’t close to
Paul nnd fccl weird about being upsct.Thc '
same applies to the heartbreak ofVirginia'
Techiwhy are some or us upset even though
we my not here known anyone who died? But
tltere is no hierarchy over claim to grief, nor
a prescribed trajectory of emotional coping.
Everyone responds differently to tmgedy, and
that’s OK.

Community is :i strange creeture.We are
tied together by common experience, common
surroundings, a common ethos. Whether or not
you knew Paul. he was one of us, a Grinncllian,
end the loss ofn friend, peer, or community
member affects us all.

This week's comingnogether, scheduled
and impromptu, was a moving demonstration
of how supportive this community can be. We
are humbled and comforted to be surrounded
by the people around us, and to live iii the
community we do. ours is a campus of
thoughtﬁil, supportive, arid wise individuals.
We should turn to each other for comfort.

lfyou're m pain, please talk to someone, be
it n friend, RLC, chaplain, or walk-in counselor
at the Health Center.

in the coming weeks, we encourage the
community to use the son as n forum for
thoughts, emotions and reﬂections nboutwhnt
hns hrppened end where we elm g0 item he .

community we should remember (Ind
mourn those we have lost lid we should
continue to love and care for each other. ll is all
too easy to forget about that love and support,
especially when things seem horrible, but it is

I don't know how to be u this After all, classes
keep going, homework keeps going, We need to just
keep going, and it seems like we don't really have the
time to dwell on what has occurred. 1 can’t do that

this is dilliullt to write, to not Jd’

from depression, and due to the selfeselecting nliture
of Grlnnell, I wollltllﬁ be surprised if the rate here
is significantly higher. Brit no one talks about it, We
hove oups for inrernntionnl students, minority stu-
dents, g y students, remrle students, mile snrdcnrs,
students in relationships, bur nor
for people who just need to tillk.
The point ofrill these groups is so
that people can coirncct with otl‘r
. trs liltc them, but there’s no group
tor people who just don't wrnr to
l‘cel alone. Depression isn't wearing black nailepolish
It's not necessrrrly tilting to hurt yourselr. Depress
sion can be an idea in the back ofyourhend thatyori’re
not good enough, lr um hejust .r tugging reeling rhnr
nothing .s nun "ight lt cnn menu simply not caring
.rbout Anything anymore.

\Vhat' cl lt ls,you don't have to dull with it rllont.
I am begging you not to deal with it alone. Talk to
your momi lk to your mom, your dad volll
best friend, le» to inc. 1 think if we have le nod
anything from this. it is rhnt there are rlwrys, n/rulrvr
people here who care About you.

Admitting that something iS wrong isn't easy, bill
the only we will ever be able to prevent some
tiling like i s lrnm litippctlirlg .gnin ifrr becomes
acceptable to tnlle .rhonr it. Our policy oi’o rcss
