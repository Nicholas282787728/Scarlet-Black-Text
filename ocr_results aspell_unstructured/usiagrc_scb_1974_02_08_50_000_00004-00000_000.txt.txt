Ring Around
the Bureaucrat

We found ourselves playing that challenging old game, “Ring
Around the Bureaucrat,” the other day.

It is really a very simple game to play. For the average citizen,
the only requirement is an extremely high tolerance for frustrae
tion. For the bureaucrat, theonly rule is: continue passing the buck.
(A straight answer means immediate disqualification.)

Our game started when we needed to know how many students
attend college outside their home states. Sounds simple enough.
We telephoned the Office of Education for Region VI in Kansas
City. The girl who answered the phone said she didn’t have the
information we needed, but if we would call the office next door,
she was certain they could help us out.

We called that office, but they said they really didn’t understand
the question. They transferred our call to another room, where
someone else could help us. '

After a short wait, we got a refreshing answer -- the gentleman
admitted that he had no idea whereto find .what we were looking for.

He was very polite about it, and transferred us to the office of
the director of higher education.

Here, we got another straight answer. “I don‘t know, but I’m sure
the Social Science desk at the Public Library could find out.”

”Office of education?” asked the librarian “Oh, yes, we get calls

from them all the time. Usually, the information they want turns
out to be in a book that they put out themselves!"
- Sure enough, we had what we needed within two minutes. Where
,was it found? In a book prepared by the Office of the Director of
Higher Education, Office of Education, Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare ,

We wouldn’t mention this little game if we didn’t have to play it
so often. In fact, we play it every time we need an answer from
anyone in the government bureaucracy. Frequently, we have to
,enlist the members of Iowa’s congressional delegation to cut
through the red tape and get us answers to the simplest of ques-

» tions.

As long as Washington’s minions throughout the nation are
allowed, and even encouraged, to play “Ring Around the Bureau-
crat,” people needing information will continue to need high
boiling points, unlimited patience, and a pocket tull otdimes.

Only the phone company wins in this game.

Explaining
the Paper Shortage

, An editor’s daily mail contains a myriad of interesting, boring,
worthwhile, worthless, and downright ludicrous press releases.
An item that fits in that last categorycame into our office the other
day, and we thought it would be worth sharing. ‘

KENNEDY AIRPORT, NEW YORK--Haggis with ”bashed neeps"
(mashed buttered turnips). Cock-a-leekie soup. Neat Scotch whisky.

Such are soine of the elements of the feast to be served to its
Scotland-bound first-class passengers by British Alrways-BOAC
in celebration of Burns Night, Jan. 25.

The special in-flight cuisine, marking the birthdayotthe renowned
Scottish poet, is intended to makeanytrue Scotsman’s mouth water,
said Serge Vermala, the airline’s USA catering manager.

The festive fare will also include smoked Scotch salmon; sirloin
of Angus beef; “rostit bubbly-jock” (roast turkey); and roast
tatties (potatoes).

To wind up, there’ll be lnverness ice cream, Argyll cake, Scottish
cheeses and oatcakes and Cockburn’s port.

For the suitable decorative touch, sprigs of white heather, fresh
from the Scotish moors, will grace each meal tray. And Scottish
airs will be piped over the aircraft’s music system.

Lest the passengers forget the occasion, flight stewards will wear
kilts and stewardesses will wear tartan sashes.

We shudder to think how many thousands ofeditors received iden-
tical "news items." We shudder even more when we remember
that this is just one of the five or so we get each day.

And you were wondering why we have a paper shortage

Not to mention what the torrents of junk do to the mail service...
'the Christmas cards that arrive in April and the Easter greetings
that get there in December.

Somehow, we’re reminded of a Bob Hope Joke. He asked a recent
audience, "Why are you all complaining about the postal service?
I’m still getting my copies of Life every Friday."

God Save (Us From) the Government ~

by Tom Knapp

Among the many things that deeply
bother Americans, polls seem to
indicate that the country is simply
sick of government, ll appears that
the sickness is much deeper than
the single symptom of Watergate.
People are simply tired of being
told what to do, being treated as
children by the Great White Father
in, Washington. When no less a
“hardline” liberal than Carl Rowan
decries the usurpations of govern-
ment into the lives of the people,
something musl be wrong A few
cases should help explain,

A recent national news slory con;
cerned the “fuel shortage" in Penr
nsylvania, This time the villain was
not the Arabs or the “oil barons,"
Instead it was the bureaucracy or
Good Ole Uncle Sam. It Seems
that there was plenty of heating
fuel in the area, but to get it, you
had to call the Federal (ueloﬂ-
ice, which ran your request through
their rat maze, and then maybe| the
fuel companies might makedelivery
in a few days. The result was
cold homes, late deliveries, and
higher prices. Plus, of course seVr
eral tens of thousands of dollars
for the bureaucrats. It would seem
that slupidily is the worst of evils.

A second area or contention is
the tax system. It seems that our
us. Congress, when the income tax
was established, decided il would
be a great idea lo use the system
to encourage certain enterprises
with the tax system. Hence our mo-
dern invention of loopholes. The
problem is that, first, the govern-
ment ,seems to be unable to make
good use of this coercive force.
The present difficulties wilh big oil
and the flight or people to the sur
burbs can be attributed to tax

breaks. Second, a philosophical ar»
gument could be made that the go-

. vernrnent has no right to decidehow
America spends its money. Why,

should we be allowed to get a break
for investment in municipal bonds
and not something else? Ithascome
to the point that the idea at a sim~
ple progressive income tax without
the loopholes is not even discussed.
And yet, in terms of fairness as
well as efficiency, it might be best
to simply have everyone pay a part
of his income and forget about the
coercive element of taxes altoge-
ther.

Finally, the best example of the
intervention of the Government into
the ireedom of the people is the
case or the welfare system. Very
simply, those people getting assis-
tance are treated worse than most
children by parents. The Great SO-
ciety programs exhibited an intol-
erable level oi paternalism, assum»
ing those receiving assistance had
little or no intelllgence ormorality.
Even the food stamp program is,
at its base, an admission by the
government that the poor could not
be trusted with real money. The
endless checks made by thebureaur
cracy was and is an insult. The
government felt it must take it
upon itself to be the sole guardian
oi the poor, moral advisor,political
organizer, and landlord. Hence we
are treated to wastes rivaling any-
thing the Pentagon has come upwith.
Witness the high rise slum cons,
tructed in St, Louis only to be dy»
namited several years later. A pi-
lot project now being tried might
help slop this problem. in lhese
cases, the poor are being given
the money to rent their own houses
or apartments. The advantageisthat
the poor are then able to compete
with the non-poor instead of being

Impeachment: ‘the'
Call for Objectivity

(Ed. noteuThe Scarlet .and Black
will present reports from two mem-
bers of the House Judiciary Com»
mittee on the current impeachment
investiguiion.

The first, from Congressman Th-
omas Railsback (It-IL), a Grinnell
graduate, appears below. We also
expect to alter periodic reports
irom Congressman Ed Mezvinsky
(on).

by Congressman Thomas Railsbnck

WASHINGTON, DC ~At lhc request
of the editor of the Grinnell Scarlet
and Black, i agreed to p'reseni some
personal observations onthe ongoing
impeachment inquiry. Although my
schedule may not permit it, i hope

to file these Views on a regular bar
SIS.

REP. THOMAS RAILSBACK

Considering ihe complexities oflhe
issues of impeachment, l lully ex-
pect that there will be those who
will disagree with my comments.
I only hope that my comments may
contribute, in some way, to in ob-
lective analysis of this topic.

The need for objectivity when coh-
sldering such a diilicull and poten»
tially emotional issue, is apparent.
Most of the members of the House,
and especially of theJudiciarndmr
mittee, which will conduct the initial

inquiry, have exhibited, from my
vantage point at least, both 3 ra—
tional and objective approach to lhis
problem. However, there are those
few, to paraphrase Bill Hungate
(D—MO), who would impeachimmed-
lately, and others who wouldn't vote
for impeachment if they personally
caught the President in a bank vault
at midnight, Neither of these posi—
tions IS acceptable.

The decision to impeach or not to
impeach must be founded on a lair,
intensive investigation of the alle»
gations and charges, and only on
this basis. We on the Judiciary;
I feel. are taking the first steps
in this direction. Under the Com—
mittee’s supervision, a highly qual-
iﬁed Sm“ is now proceeding with
the invesligaiion on a daily basis.
In addition, the House today has
adopted, wilh bipartisan support,
a resolution granting subpoena ante
horiiy‘ to our committee icr its
investigations and I fully supported
lhis action. with thegrzlntingofsuch
authority, the House hastakenaslg»
nlficant step forward in achieving
a responsible answer to the num»
erous allegations, questions, and
doubts which encompass the Pres-
idency. 7

Peter Rodino (D»NJ), Chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, has ins
dicated that we can complete our
work by April 30, but this deadline
for our recommendations can only
be met with the cooperation of the
White House and of the Special
Prosecutor, Leon Jaworski. The
President, in his State Oi the Union
message, declared his intentions to
cooperate with our Committee and
we are encouraged by his remarks
At the same lime, our lop commit-
tee counsels, John Doar and Albert
Jenner, are proceeding with negOr
tiations with Mr. Jaworskl to arr»
ange for a transfer of needed evie
dence But regardless of the coop,
eratlon we receive, I am convinced
that the Judiciary Committee is de
termined to iuliill its constitutional
responsibility to conduct a thorough
and bi partisan impeachment in»
quiry,

treated as separate cases. Hope-
fully, (but not likely) more money
will be directed to programs such
as this. Perhaps the old maxim
about the best cure for poverty
being money mightbegivena Chance.
Some icrm of negative income tax
system 'would free the poor from
the shackles of complete govern-
ment control. Perhaps the money
might even reach the poor, rather
than the bureaucracy administering
the presenlprograms.

The point is that many people are
tired of being ordered around by
the government, This is a much
broader based revolt than the Wall-
lace people or the McGovern die—
hards. Government can work to
help those people in financial or
other difficulties without ordering
their lives. The function of our

government is not to see how many ,

people il can employ itself. It is
lime to give the people of the coun-
try the resources and protection
they need, while still giving them
the freedom to make their own
choices, Every expansion by the
government has the possible side
effect of destroying a person’s ch-
ance to run his own life. New ideas
icr rerorm are needed, but the as,
sumpiion that this necessarily
means an expanded governmentneed
not be so.
