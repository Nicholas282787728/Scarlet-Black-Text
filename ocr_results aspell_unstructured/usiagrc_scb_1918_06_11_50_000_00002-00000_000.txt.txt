.lu Itm‘outt

With this issue, the present management of the Scarlet and Black will
probably terminate. Both the editor and the business manager will undoubt-
edly become members of thc notional army during the summer. and a now.
editor and a new business manager will take charge when collegq opens next
fall.

it is with a feeling of regrct. in a sense. that we Sever the relationships
with the paper which we have come to call "our own" during these seven
short weeks, Probably no other editor and business manager have held so
short a term of office. We have not as yet made a great deal of headway. and
we have not even bnited at several policies which have been in mind.

We have advocated awaiting the draft. and we have been criticized for
doing so. But we still advocate it. for we believe in it heart and soul. Yes.
we believe it will make a greater Gl" noll. but that has not been our purpose
in this one instance. We believe it will dcfeat the kaiser, by permitting the
government to call the men as it sees fit. and that it will give America a big-
ger hand in the reconstruction period than almost any other single agency. for
it will furnish our country a group of trained leaders who will be able to
carry on the work of rebuilding our national institutions after the great con-
flict is ended.

We are proud to go. Almost any day we are expecting the letters that
will call us into the service of Uncle Sam. We are not asking sympathy—it
has no place here. And we are not asking praise—that. too. is a thing of which
we are not desirous. All wc are asking is a hearty handshake, if we deserve it.
and godspeed in the work which we are about to enter.

Mr. Eglofi and Mr. Ramsey, the editor and business manager elect. have
both had considerable experience in their respective lines. Egloff has been
assistant director of the Grinnoll News Bureau since last October and has
been a reporter on the Scarlet and Black for over a year. Ramsey has been
circulation and assistant business manager for several months. and is well
qualified for his new position. Both men are exceptionally well fitted to carry
the Scarlet and Black thru the year 1913-19. a year which is bound to be'one
of.the hardest in the history of the paper. ‘

In closing, we want to thank the staff for their hearty cooperation with
the retiring management. during our term of office. It has been a pleasure in-
deed to work with a group of people who have been more than mere reporters
and assistantsiwho have been frionds, They have helped us mskc the Scar-
let and Black what from the first we intended it should M7“; new paper, and
a newspaper free from sensationalism," \

In truth. wc have had in mind. nborc all, ”A Greater Grinnell."

ﬁe..—
AS THE GRINNELL MA) LEAVES.

A: President llaui has said, “Grinnell College is a War College,”

Wherever thc Scarlet and Black is unfurled, it is recognized as an emblem
of loyalty to the Unitcd States government and to the issues for which this
greatest war of all hisory is being fought. Grinnell's loyalty has never been
doubted.

The 410 stars on the service Hag. including those representing approxi-
mately fifteen professors and instructors or over onerfoui‘th of the total mime
her of men on the facul 'ndlcates the spirit with which Grinnell has entered
the Conflict. The four gold stars indicate that her blood is ftli'eztdy hciug shod.
The grcnt number of Grinnell students in the service shows that we have eh-
tered this war lll earnest, while the work of the women. both at home and
in France. proves that the Grinncll woman. too. is battling almost literally in
the trenches. All this is a glory which we will find hard to surpass.

But there is another side. Many of us. perhaps the majority of us, who
are leaving Grinncll in the midst of our college courses are leaving never to
return. Thcrc is a strong probability that. after the war is over and victory
is attained, we will enter some university where we can quickly complete our
education and launch immediately into a business cnrcer. Are we glad to have
had cvcn a short opportunity to ll\c in the midst of thc Grinnell Spirit, to
have mndc so many lasting friendships with Grinnell pcoplo. to have associated

. with Grilmcll’s broad—minded professors, and to act under the guidance of its
president who has placed the Gi-lnnell idcnl on so high a. standard?

These are onlv a few of tho things we arc leavulg when we leave Grinncll.
Such matters are insignificant in comparison to the fight for world democracy
hut thcy represent the most vilal port or our lives up to this time.

WC are proud to hort- the privilege oi going to war. but Gridiron, we hit:
glad we tramp.

INNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

u'cr. Under thc new plan of gcvormncnt sllpc cd in tory training which
has been worked out by the war department for American colleges. Crinnoll
will bottom a militar. school next ycar in a very rcal scnso. . Tho training
given will be much liko that at a piano like Comp Dodge. but the men will
be bnndlod in a vastly (lll'lcleut way. At Comp Dodge, the ideal must he to
train an enormous number of over-age men in a short time. AL Crinnell. thc
idcal should he to train a small, solcctotl group of mon, carefully and them»
ly. for positions of leadership in tlie army.

Collcgc men must shoulder heavy responsibilities in this war. They are
cvpcctcd to do. and should do more than an avcrcge man‘s work in the army;
thcy should be trained to car -on that wo successfully.

livcragc men are easy to obtain; they reach training camps hy the thour
sands every month But leadership in the army, at least the kind of leader
ship that will result in a successful and speedy termination of this war. dc-
mantis more than average men. it dcmsnds men of character. intelligence
and training.

The collegcs must furnish such mon. ththcr they rank as captains or
privates while they serve is not the important questionithey must be ready
and willing to do the diificult tasks; they must be the leaders, either as oftlr
cers, or us specialists in particular fields.

Next year is no tinic for idling. Every man of eighteen or over should
he in thc scr icc. or in a college specializing in military training and the
studies which will fit him to he a leader in the army. And if a man is able
to choosc the latter course. his seriicc will be greater. finally, if he makes tnc
most of his opportunities.

Loafing in college can bc tcloratcd no more than loating in a ii'ajuiug

must be to help win the war,

townspeople. for tllcy were what are commonly known as f‘good fellows."

Thell’vztspil‘zlllous were high, and they wanted to attend college. So the
following September they packed up their worldly belongings, and left home.

One was vcry modost, Hc ncvor put himsolt forward. but. rather, he took

The other vouug fellow grew impatient. The students and faculty did
not recognize his excepllonal talentsitlley thought of him only as an average
studcnt,‘whcrcas he was really far above the ordinary. Soon he began to
“confide" in :t few of the juniors and seniors. He told them in what SI VlLies
he had been engaged in high schuul. and what a. “big man" he had been
there. Then he began to “admit" to the entire College that. he was exceplibnal.
He should be given an opportunity to show what he was made of.

And he Was' He bcgztu to resolve warnings to mend his ways. Some

tluns, and gained the respect of the entire College. The second. falling to per-

WE SALUTE!

A great deal of credit is due Sergeant Vance and the Grinnell student of
flcers for the efficient way in which they have conducted military drill during
the greater part of the second semester.

Coming here at a time when the work was in a state of utter disorganiza-
tion. Sergeant Vance placed military training on a firm foundation and in—
stilled into it a spirit which it had lacked from the very beginning. Officers
were installed and a scheme of discipline was introduced which has proved
the backbone of the entire system.

When the sergeant was called back into active service, many thought that
military training in Grinnell was bound to fall back into the old rut~thatdt
would again become a minor part of the institution‘s “joke." so to spe But
the last few months have shown the error of this belief.

The student officers. including Captains Kelly. Fridlund and Kilgore.
First Lieutenants Baker. Heath and Dsubcnberger. and also Sergeant Hiuer,
undci- Acting Major Kelly until a fcw wccks ago, and since that time under-
Captain Fridlund. have proved equal to the task of carrying on a high grnde
system of training. They have issued orders, and have demanded that those
orders he obeyed. and they have commanded the respect of every man with
whom they have worked. .

Mlsiakes have been made. They have been inevitable. But .cverything
connected with the system has worked out in the end {or the best interests of
Grinncll. ‘

And so to you. Sergeant Vance, and commissioned officers of Grinncll, we
offer our congratulations. Your task has been difficult, but you have met it,
and you have met it well. ’

We salute-

’]‘0 THE MEN IX THE SERVICE.

We have said before. and we repeat the statement. that there is no other
collcge or univcl ‘ . in the country better represented proportionately in the
war than Grinnell We say it with a pride which is far too great to be ex—
Dressed in mere words.

 

Two wccks ago apploximatcly seventyrfive star-s werc added to drinnell's
.servrce flag. bringing the total up to 410. with 410 men already in the scr co
.and scor s more preparing to go, either by enlistment. or the draft route. Gl'lrl-
incl! is in the war “up to the neck," The “Yanks" of Grinnell are already
among the number who are hurling back the German hordcs along the Mai-no.

To say that we, as a college. arc proud of those men. does not in the
l

ismnllc, incasurc express our feeling of adoration. Thcy llave offered their
grcctcst gilt. thcir lives. it need be. that Amcrico might live. 'and that thc peo—
ple of the world might linvc a right to say how they shall be governed.
