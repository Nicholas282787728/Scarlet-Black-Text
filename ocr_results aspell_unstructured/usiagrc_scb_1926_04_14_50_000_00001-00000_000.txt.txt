for “Fashion," the faculty play which

“The success of this comedy has not
been equaled by that of any other pro-

on each night it has been acted was
loud, spontaneous, and unanimous,
and the Curtain fell amid the ruptur—
ous cheers of a delighted audience. In
consequence of the enormous throngs
which have flocked nightly in his sup—

to announce that the free list, for this
performance, with the exception of
the Press, has been entirely suspend-

The close of the winter tb d of the
intramural sports schedule finds
Clark bhll holding a slight margin
over Laugau and Dibble. In a thrill-
ing game that smacked or big league
calibre the ﬁvers defeated Dibble in
the final indoor ball game for the
championship and thereby added the
necessary points to their total to put
them in a fairly safe lend.

Two Events Remain

Only two more events remain on the
card for the dorm athletes, those be-
ing an intramural track meet on May
19th and the annual outdoor baseball
tournament scheduled to begin Mans
day, April 19th.

By the system of scoring which is
based on competition as well as abil-
ity the all-around championship is
within the grasp of the first three
teams, with Kelly hall holding a slim
chance of breaking in for honors. As
scholarship also is figured in the
standing there may be further change
before the cup is awarded.

)llllny )[en Compete

So far this year 1054 men have com»
pcted in 61 contests which shows tbe
scope of the program sponsored by the
athletic department, Last {all 350 men
took part in 15 speedball games and 18
ran in the one cross-country run. Dur-
ing the winter 386 men saw competi-
‘tion in 30 basketball games and 300
were on baseball line-ups in 15 games.

A manager for the spring program
will be appointed soon and a definite
baseball schedule will be drawn up,
but at present it is thought that the
same program will be used that has
been followed throughout the year.

With the appointment of spring

First Gridiron Banquet Proves
‘Right Royal Razz Session’ in All
Phases; ‘Hap’ Moran Wins Derby

 

Personalities, and human weakness-
es were not spared Saturday night as
some 135 guests at the annual grid-
iron banquet put on by the Gf'innell
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, national
professional journalistic fraternity,
availed thomselved of the opportunity
to speak in candid and cutting terms
of their friends and enemies in a
Right Royal Razz Session at the Mon-
rue hotel.

starting at nine o’clock, the hou—
qllet was a riot of humor from start
to finish, Barely bad the guests be-
come seated when a burly ex—army
captain entered the room and demand-
ed a seat. When refused a place, he

went out and returned with the sher—r

iii of the county, who forced the toast-

master to make room for Lhein.
Various telegrams frm notables, liv-

ing and dead, expressing their dis—

appointment at being unable to attend=

the affair, interrupted the course of
the dinner, and provivcd the prelimin—
ilry laughs. Judas Iscariot, the great-
est liar of history, Napoleon Bonapart,
Iulius Satan, Jesse James, fling Lard-
ner, Gerald Chapman, Vera the Count-
255 of Camccrt, and Andrew Volstead,
wired their regrets, and sent regards
to one or more of the guests.

A copy of the Scarlet and Black,
was at each guest's place when he ar-
rived and a special Razzberi‘y number
ol the Malteascr, the humorous maga—
zine published by the Grinnell chap

ter of the fraternity. Red Hot Static,
it burlesque sheet razzing everyone
present, and many who could not at-
tend, brought in by a newsboy during
hills in the program, served to keep
up the interest of the guests.

Prizes were awarded to the best
looking man on the faculty, who was
found to be Prufessor Ryan, the best
dressed faculty member, Mr. H. W‘.
ilatlack. the dumbest student in col-
lege, Rex Ingram, '26, himself a mem-
ber of Phi Beta Kappa society, the
most unsophisticated, Roger Eudloug,
'25, the most brilliant man in the col-
lege, Gordon Meeter, ’27, football star,
and finally the brown derby, on award
presented at similar Sigma Delta. Chi
affairs the country over, was tendc‘red
to “Hap" Moran, ’26, basketball and
football star. for having obtained the
best grades with the least work.

Extemporaneous wit and l'epztrtee,
rnzzing uumercifully both speakers
and audience, added to the hilarity of
[the occasion. and it was not until one
lA. M. that the guests were ready to go
home.

Among the distinguished guests
were: G. A. Snider, Ralph Moorhcnd,

Sandburg Comments
On Tanager Articles

Two articles in the April issue of
the Tanager, Grinnell's literary mags
zine, received high praise from Carl
Sandburg who recently appeared here
in a recital. Sandburg's comment is
contained in .1 letter to Way-lie Gard,
instructor in journalism:

"Tell Rose Gero she can Write, has
a little revolutionary tinting that is
healthy, and she can go far if she
wants to. That sketch ‘All~Amel'i-
can' was a strong, spare piece or
work." “All-American” was written
by Arthur C, Risser. Both he and
Miss Gero are ireshmeu.

Marquette university has introduced
an innovation in the business admluls-
tration course by allowing credit on
the first year in the law college on a
B. S. in Business Admlnlstrntion. thus

 

combining B B. S. with all LLB.

Grinnell Forensic
0f Prominent

To Handle Trial
College Journalist

 

A most Curious civil case has just
been registered in the Grinnell courts
wherein Tcd Jordan, '29, prep foot.
hall still: accuses Donald Brown, ’27,
prominent college journalist, ol' lnar
licious attempt to Commit manslaugh-
‘tel'.

EXaCt character of the crime is not
set forth in the court charges. but it
is alleged that Brown assaulted Jor-
dan while he was strolling peacefully
across the campus last Sunday after—
noou. There is every reason to be—
lieve that there may be some truth in
the accusations as Jordan has ben
wearing heavy bandages all week.

Both the plaintiff and the accused
arc promlnent ln many campus activit-

 

ies, Brown having made a. name ‘lor

himself as contributor to several cams
[)us publications and Jordan having
been one of the stellar athletes of the
prop football squad. It is rumored
that Brown, not desiring the publicity
of a regular court trial, has asked that
the case be tried before a jury of col-
lege students. Reporters who heseig~
cd both men today were all turned
away without any statement from for
the press, all news concerning the
fight having been obtained by the
Scarlet and Black from eye witnesses
of the fray,

As a matter af fact, the whole af-
fair was perpetrated and will be hand-
led by Grinnell Forensic. The details
will be made public shortly.

 

Senior Exams
Not Required

_ _ 2:2:
Givimg of Senior Filllll Exilms is Left
to Discretion oi Professors.

The argument between faculty and
seniors about senior exams resulted in
a decision that the exempting of
seniors from final ekums would be left
to the discretion of the professor.

The senior committee, after several
months of deliberation met with the
faculty on Monday afternoon with
Roma Kauffrhhn as spokesman. The
discussion that followed was a lively
and somewhat prolonged one but fin-
ally ended in 'the adoptlng by a 12 to
4 vote the above measure proposed
by Professor Almy.

At the close of the meeting, sincere
gratitude was expressed by several
members of the faculty in respect to
the spirit of coropel'ation shown be»
tween faculty and seniors in the set-
tlement of this matter.

BHAIEIEllEXPlAINE HIE

Edit/J nuchicf of Famous New Oxford
Dictionary 'f‘rdccs Progress of
Lexicon to Date.

”Dictionaries," D Craigie said in
his lecture in Her ck chapel last Sat-
urday, ”are so often used for instan-
tenus relief for ignorance, that users
fail to realize the enormous amount of
work entailed in their makeup." Dr.
Craigie is an accepted authority on
the English language and at the pres»
out time editorrinechiel of the New
Oxford dictionary.

The professor divided his lecture in—
to three parts: the development of
the English dictionaries, the methods
used in comp us them, and a brief
discussion of etymology and American
slans.

Renders Arc Essential

Dr. Craigie said that readers are the
most essential part to the makeup of
a dictionary force. These readers are
often voluntary workers who do their
work out of pure interest in the sub—
ject. The job of the reader is to read
books and armed with immeasurable
patience and, a half a. million or so of
paper slips, to scan the lines for quo-
tations which explain words employed
in it. The method of employing quo-
tations to explain the use of words
was begun in the early part of the
eighteenth century by Dr, Samuel
Johnson. Dr. Johnson's method was to
mark passages and then have hls as-
sistants copy them out. -

Dr. Craigic then traced the progress
of the dictionary to the present time.

‘The great diligence used in scanning

a hook, the professor said, throws light
on the methods and efficiency uf an
author. A book like Spenser's “Fair-
ie Queenie” is probably read five or
six times over.

Dictionary h‘eur Completion

The New Oxford dictionary of which.
Dr, Cruigie is, chief editor, is.now,
comparatively speaking, near to com-
pletion. It now has nine and one half
volumes and when completed will
ten.

Dr. Crnigle predicts a new dictionr
ary for the United States He said
contrary to popular opinion, English
is spoken with greater purity in Am-
Crica than in England. The professor
gnvo several illustrations showing how
the American colonist had. enriched
the English language. He mentioned
such words as bogus, carcass, scala—
ung, and awful

Slang to Become National

In speaking of the recognition of
slang, Dr. Craigie said that a certain
per cent of the s'lltng of today would
become a natural part of standard
language in tho next generation. A
dictionary, he said, recognizes the
successes and ignores the failures.

A swift completion of the new dic-
tifillary, the speaker concluded, de-
pends on the financial interest which
this country will place in it.

President I. H. T. Main left Friday
night for it ten day 'trip to Boston and
New York on college business.
