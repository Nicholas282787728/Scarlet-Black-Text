ONE FAIR indication of the ivork
that a college is doing is the use
that is made by students and {ac-
ulty of its library. In these days
of multitudinous books and mag-
azines, when something is being
contributed almost daily to every
department of the world’s wise
dom, amuch wider outlook upon
the subject studied than can be
gained through any system of
textbooks is essential to a liberal
culture. Moreover, the present
array of accessible reference
books, and the improved methods
of library economy, render it quite
possible for a student to make in-
dependent investigations along
almost any line he may wish to
. follow. That there are many stu-
dents who fail to make use of the
privileges afforded by such library
facilities as we have here, goes
without saying. it is one ot the
pathetic facts of our college lite
that an occasional student can
pass through a term of years at
Grinnell without familiarizing
himself enough with the library so
that he can ﬁnd a book for himr
self or ﬁll out a requisition blank
properly
On the other hand there are
many who spend a good pereent~
age ottheirwaking, working hours
in Goodnow Hall, and many more
who have seemed to make a judir
clous use of the library. With
the methods of instruction now
followed it is quite difﬁcult for a
student to do satisfactory class
room work without at least occa-
sional visits to the library; and
this is as it should be.
The library advantages open to
Iowa College students, though as
yet by no means what we could

wish, are considerable, and in—

' books ot accessions to the library

indicatesasteady growth in the
number at volumes, though the
increase has been by no means
phenomenal, January 1, 1896.
the number of books accessible
to date, was 20,758. The additions
during 1896 were 1.196; during
1897, 1,597 and since January 1,
1895 there has been 1.167. These
accessions of the last three years
include large donations of books
from the estates of ex-President
Magoun, Mr. E. D. Rand, Prof.
F. D. Brewer and Rev. A. 8.
Robbins, gifts of books also from
Rev, Wm. Salter of Burlington,
Dr. Albert Shaw, Prof. Parker,
besides the United States and
State documents; and cash gifts
tor the purchase oi new books
from Mrs. E. D. Rand, ex»Goy.
Larrabee, the classes or 1887 and
1896, the Chrestomathian Society,
and the Grinnell Institute. Gene
erous Contributions have also been
made by various other persons,
all of whom cannot here be men-
tioned for obviousreasons. On the
whole the interest manifested in
the library by both donors and stu-
dents is quite satisiactory though
an increase of it will add not a
little to the cﬂiciency of the work
done here.

Intercollegiate Debates,

Chicago University and the
University of Minnesota debated
last evening in Chicago on the
question, “Resolved, That an
amendment to the constitution
should be secured whereby the
United States Senators should be
elected by the people." Chicago
supporting the negative, won the
debate.

At Ann Arbor last night the
University of Michigan won in the
debate wtth Northwestern. The
winners of these two debates meet
in Chicago Aprll 7. and contest
for the championship of the asso-
ciation.
