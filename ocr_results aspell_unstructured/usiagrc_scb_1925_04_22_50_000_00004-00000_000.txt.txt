Birth of a Nation’ set in its ddy.”~

heights attained by 'hmerioa' from a

“ABIE’S IRISH BOSE.”

"Abie’s Irish Rose,” the comedy by
Anne Nichols that has been meeting
with record-breaking success wher-
ever presented, comes to the Colonial
Theatre for an engagement or two
nights, Thursday and Friday, April
23 and 24.

One of the features of this popular
comedy is the contrasting types. The
story concerns the romance of Ahrn-
ham Levy, a Jewish boy, and Rose-
mary Murphy, whose forehears. as
may be supposed, have come from the
Emerald Isle. The marriage oi these
two young people by n"pcrlcctly lover
1y Methodist minister" naturally meets
with great opposition lrom their re-
spective families, and the young
couple, after trying in Vain to placate
the objectors, are disinherited. How-
ever, the iinal curtain falls upon a
"happy ending" and the two warring
fathers are united in their admiration
for their twin grandsons, Patrick and
Solomon.
