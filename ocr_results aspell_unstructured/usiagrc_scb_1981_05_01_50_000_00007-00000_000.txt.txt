Raybeats wrll shake up your Saturday

by Anne Six

Well wake up little Suzy; now is the
lime [or all modern rockers to redance
their roots The Raybeats will be riding
the surge of rockrworld credentials that
brings them from a monthrlong tour of
Great Britain to Grinnell for this
weekend's dance concert it promises
to be the pic-hit of the semester.

This major concert continues a Grin~
nell tradition of booking excellent new
music: Janis Joplin in the 305; Grace
Slick, Bruce Springsteen in '74;
Weather Report, The Police in ’73; and
last year's Ramones concert.

The Raybeats' electric instrumentals
blenderize the surf craze of the '605 with
strains of rhythm and blues, jazz and
soul. The result is exhilarating

Their first album, Roping Wild
Bears, recorded on the DontFall Off
the Mountain label, was released in
January of this year, By April it ranked
number eight on the London chartsl

New York Rocker said. "The world
awaits another good instrumental
record,"

The combo is composed of four
members. Drummer Don Christensen

and guitarist Jody Harris were‘formerr
ly with the Contortions. Raybeat bassist
Danny Amis was recruited from the
overtones of Minneapolis. Fat Irwin.
Grinnell ’77, recently with Lydia Lunch,
switch-hits betwen alto sax, Ace organ

and guitar.

There are no vocals and no in-
strumental solos, The music is a
catalytic interplay of compulsive dance
beat with shift-and-go melody. lt soars.

The Raybeats will play Grinnell
Saturday. Depending upon the weather,
the dance concert will be held either on
central campus at 2 pm. or Darby
Gymnasium at 9:30 pm. if it's in Dar
by, both tickets and student identifica»
tion are required. Georgia Dentei, per-
forming programs director, said, “The
decision will become fairly obvious if
the band doesn’t start in the
afternoon."

Dentel also warned people to be on
time. ”Normally, the Raybeats play on-
ly 45 minute sets but they've agreed to
lengthen the concert to two sets of 50 to
60 minutes," she said. “You'll miss a lot
if you’re late.”

Dont bother getting “Dressed”

To the Editor:

Dressed to Kill, scheduled to be
shown on Grinnell campus this
weekend, is one of a proliferating
species of films which explicitly pore
tray violence directed toward young
women, Bloodline, Halloween and in-
numerable Briilms are examples of
movies which horrity iand presumably
thrill) audiences with rape and murder
scenes which are undoubtedly realistic.
These movies display significant com-
monalities: the victims are consistently
young, beautiful, independent and orten
sexually liberated. I believe that the
violence which appears in these movies
is worthy of some special remarks
despite the omnipresence or many
other forms of violence in the entertain-
ment media.

It is a fact that women live in fear of
bodily harm today more than ever
before. According to FBI statistics, 3
lzryearvold girl in the United States has
a one in three chance at being raped in
her lifetime. I am not presumptuous
enough to think that 1 can fully identify
with this fear but I believe many men
would be shocked to discover. as I was,
the role rear plays in the lives of many
women who live in urban and even
suburban areas. Films like Dressed to
Kill exploit this fear; that is, they are
successful in so far as they manage to
recreate terror in their audiences

Furthermore, these iilms encourage
the idea that such violence, which
possesses nothing of the ‘fair- light
flavor of a Clint Eastwood shoot out, is
normal. Sarah McCarthy, psychologist

May i, veal

in Humanist (Otto '79) writes, “Thereis
a long macho tradition in this culture
that pronounces certain forms of
violence as perfectly appropriate just
as , . . hunters harvest deer." McCarthy
argues that violence against women,
perpetrated by men, is one such kind of
violence. Dressed to Kill and movies,
magazines and album covers with
similar themes contribute to a climate
which not only allows such atrocities to
occur but even encourages them. Susan
Brownmiller, author of Against Our
will, asks, "Does one need scientific
methodology in order to conclude that
the antifemale propaganda that
permeates our nation‘s cultural output
promotes a climate where sexual
hostility directed against women is not
only tolerated but ideologically en-
couraged'!“

Lastly. Dressed to Kill. like its
counterparts, suggests that women
who a're assaulted in some way invite
sexual/physical abuse. The semir
promiscuous personalities ot the vic-
tims are somehow supposed to suggest
mat these women perhaps deserve or at
least “ask for” the Violent treatment
they receive. Phyllis Schafly is not the
only proponent of this view, as McCarr
thy writes, “Society, religion and
biology have insisted that women say
no when they mean yes. This is the
mustard seed of the view that women
want to be raped."

I would like to appeal to the humanist
sensibilities that Grinnell often em-
bodies. Dressed to Kill exemplifies a

destructive social lorce and demands a
response from those who attend films at
Grinnell. Simply choosing not to attend
is one way of responding; openly VOIC-
ing opposition to the showing oi such
films is a more effective method of pro-
test. Allow those who select these films
to know that you are offended by them.
Grinnell should remain a forum for con-
troversial events but Dressed to Kill is
not concerned with making a social
statement, controversial or otherwise.
Instead, it panders to the destructive
forces in persons which create so much
of the misery and destruction we read
about and hear of each day, 7 Eric

KDIC slander?

To the Editor: -

Several incidents of verbal abuse
have occurred during Eugene Reid's
radio program on KDIC this year.
Recently, I heard my name being used
by an obviously demented mind in con-
nection with a hodgepodge of sexual
episodes on Reid’s program on Mon
day, April 27 at 1:45 pm. i was totally
appalled and nothing has been done to
rectify this infringement of my per-
sonal rights and misuse of a public ser-
vice. ll KDIC cannot keep its DJS from
airing harmful, obscene and vulgar
comments, then I will be forced to seek
legal renumeration. Sincerely very tru-
ly. Carlla Duster
