nuch work i have. it's only the
nemories I have oltmy semester in
Trance that assure me that the
whole world isn't composed oi
vorkaholics. At least. not Grinnellr
style workaholics French students

Nay. To them the university is
norc like a job, to leave at the end
it the day and on the weekends.
vtost French students live in the
dorms or their own apartments
'ive days a week and then go to

weekends, For example, my iriend

Restaurant Review

Grandpa’s offers “good, filling food ”

by Barbara Brown and Bruce
Emond ,

New York has the Tavern on the
Green, Paris has the Ritz. and until
September oi this year, Grinnell
had McCurry's. On September lst,
though, McCurry’s ownership
changed hands and Keith McCam-
mant opened Grandpa's.
Grandpa's restaurant is located in
a small, unobtrusive, red-brick
building on Route 146. while it is
not in the Same league as the Ritz,
Grandpa's does oiier good iood in
ample portions, all tor prices con
siderably less than those iound at
its Parisian counterpart.

A cozy atmosphere greets diners
entering Grandpa‘s seat-yourseli
dining room. An exceptional painr
ting of Elvis on black velvet hangs
on one wall, nanked to the right by
a clock in the shape oia guitar. on
a wall across the room hangs a
huge “Texas Fly Swatter" adja
cent to an extremely large,
presumably Texan, ily. A light
haze or cigarette smoke drapes the
air but does not obscure the in
viting smell oi trying grease.
