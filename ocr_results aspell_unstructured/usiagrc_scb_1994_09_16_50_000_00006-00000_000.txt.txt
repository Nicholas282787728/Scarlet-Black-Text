thony Cammarata, aka. Tigger, can

Along with sophomore Sam

help of ravers all across the Midwest,
from as far away as St. Louis, Minne-
apolis and Purdue University in Indie
aria, Cammarata has lined up a PA.
lights and a fog machine for the event.

Originally planned as an “after
party” forAlice In Wonderland (which
is now scheduled for Saturday. Octo-
ber 1). Cammarata was encouraged by
his raving friends to throw his own
party. Cammamtasaid theevent“blos-

somed into something unreal" and
shonly became a reality.

Carnmaiata first got hooked to
dance musicshortlyafter the ManchesA
[or sound broke out of England in the
lateeighties. He got into“acid house"
music and bands like the Happy Mon-
days and the Stone Roses. In 1992.
Cammamta attended his first lave in
Chicago and has been hooked ever
Stnce. PHOTO PHOBIA will be the
first event he has ever thrown himself.

When asked what sort of music
would be featured at PHOTO PHO-
BIA. Carnmarata replied “everything
from Gabber to Garage." Cammarata
predicts the evening to start out with
Hardcore Techno, evolve into Trance
Dance and Tribal Music. turn into
House and Old School Breakbcat and
end on the upswing with Good Momr
ing House and/or Disco. "We‘ll start
at 210 [beats per minute] and end

somewhere around 96," Carninarata
added.

Cammarata. along with almost a
dozen other D15, will be spinning his
own set of grooves. He described
tomorrow’s set as “deep Chicago
House WM] 2 Tribal [lair Ijust have
fun. Who knows’.7 I may play the
Muppet Show theme song, and you
mightﬁnd yourselfenjoyingit. That‘s
all that is important. Just fun. some
thing different, something wonderful.
I'm sick of the old same. same, same.
It’stimeforsomethingdifferentnow.”
When asked ifPHOTO PHOBIA was
an alternative to Harris. he simply
smiled and said, “It should not be an
alternative to anything. It‘s just an
experience."

When the Norris Hall Council
approved the event, nocurfew was set.
The event should go on long after
tomorrow's Han-is pany is over.

NEVER an artist’s work
is Chosen for an exhibit. a
complement is paid to the
creator. and the person can bcproud of
what he or she has accomplished. The
studans showing work in the exhibit
currently being shown atthe Fine Ans
Building can becspecizilly happy wtth

they are all beginning artists in their
ﬁelds. they have produced beautiful
professionﬂquuality artwork wonhy

The exhibition of work by stu-
dents in IOO-series studio courses last
year includes about 30 sculptures.
prints, and drawings. The pieces were
chosen by instructors for their excel-
lence from those submitted by Stu»
dents.

Theworksbeingshownrepresent
a whole spectrum of attitudes and
moods. Included is everything from
sullen charcoal still-life drawings to
introspective sclfrportrait busts to
mounted and painted collages oftrash
with almost humorous undertones.
Although a wide variety of artwork is
on display, the pieces are related in

skills such as learning to dmw and
design. developing an artistic visron

elements found in the works.

Why exhibit the works of begin—
ning artists for everyone to see? Art

”This show gets the artwork out of the
context of the studio, and allowssuidenis
