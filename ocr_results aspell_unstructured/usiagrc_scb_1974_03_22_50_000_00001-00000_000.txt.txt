48235 Pumps Go Dry

by Abbi Swanson

Texaco's reknowned Bo Battey is
quitting the gas business. In lact,
he closed the pumps a iew days
ago.

However, there is no cause (or
disappointment, Bo has simply ph-
ased out one sector ol his many—
laceted business, located on the
corner of 6th and West. “The gas

usiness,” Bo stated, “has become
very complex, and there's notenough
of me to go around.” Revenue de-
rived irom pumping gasoline has
steadily decreased, allocations to
dealers have also declined, the prir
ce structure for gas is very restr
rictlve, and Bo wants to concen-
trate on other aspects oi transpore
tation.

in the future, Bo Battey’s “Cenr
tral Service" station will locus

. on improvement of eXlstihg serr
vices. Speciﬁcally, the Greyhound
bus depot and package express serr
Vice will be given attention. An ex-
pansion of shop operations, through
the purchase oi new automotive
testing equipment, is also planned.
Eo anticipates that most of the cars
he will service will be those whose
owners purchase cutrrate or ‘dis-
count’ gasoline, and at present have
no place to check their autos. lie
plans no physical expansion oi ex-
isting facilities.

Bo assumed the Texaco dealership
in Grinnell in September, 1968.
His lamily has been involved in sir
milar pursuits lor 50 years in 05k-
aloosa, Iowa. 80 said he likes this
part or the country, and has past
connections with Grinnell. From

Faculty Tables Calendar Plan

by Dee Dee Goldie

The college Calendar lor the 1974
- 75 academic year proposed in
last week's Campus Memo was ta-
bled until alter break in the laculty
me ting last Monday. The faculty
voted twenty-live to sixteen with
six abstensions to send the calen»
dar back to the Committee on Ac-
adenlic Standing for further consid-
eration.

Jnhn Plitsch, athletic director, st-
ated his objections to the calendar
at the meeting. He lelt that a six
Week break was necessarythis year,
but would greatly damagethe quality
oi the winter sports teams ii the
practice was continued in the lu-
tiire. He noted that no other schools
in the conference seemed to have
the energy problems Grinnell had
and that most have consistent sch-
eduling Starting around the first oi
January.

Grinnell teams get a late start,
Plitsch said, and are at a disad-
vantage because they play onerhall
ot the season without any other
students on campus to support th—
em. They must also live in the
Physical Education Complex, and
have to have a very tight scher
dule as no other schools want to
play in late February and March
during their exam periods, he con»
tinued. Plitsch moved that the six
week break be shortened by two
weeks.

JUhn Hansen, Student Government
President—elect; also objected to

roughout his college career. >

the proposed calendar. He statedthat
many students did not know about
an open torum held to discuss the ,
calendar, and it they had there would"
have been many objections toit. The
longer break, said Hansen, affected
students chances at getting summer
jobs. damagedthewintersportspro-
gram, created an inconveniently sh-
ort spring break without tull board,
and was boring,

Hansen noted the drop in enroll-
ment alter first semester and spec—
ulated on a possible connection betv
ween it and the Six week break.
He also lelt that the ligures on fuel
conservation were just as depend-\
ent on the mild weather as the Six
week break and stated that many
oi the supposedly closed buildings

‘ were open during break.

lianseh suggested to the laculty
that the administration make a real
commitment to tuel conservation,
and investigate other ways to save
energy without a six week break.
He also expressed a desire tor anr
other open lorum and lor the decir
sion to be put at! until alter break.

He appeared in “Country Wile,”
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Ne-

st," “The Fantasticks,” “Once
Upon a Mattress," and several mi-
me periormances produced by the
Grinnell troupe.

He also adapted and directedaplay

“The White Deer" ior a perlormr
ance by students atthe Grinnell Jun:
ior High School.

Gaines is the 12th Grinnell College
student to win 3 Watson iellowship
in the past six years.

Rick Faust, a member oi the has-y

ketball squad this year, said that
he had been willing to cooperate
with the inconveniences the six week
break caused for one year,but spec-
ulated that many players would not
come out ior winter sports if the
practice was continued. He believed
his academics sullered as a result
ol the hectic traveling situation
the break lorced them to main-
tain, and hinted that many of the
racial problems on the team may
have been due to the compressed
season. Faust believed that il the
six week break was continued in
the future, it would eventually des-
troy the winter sports season. ,

Acting on a resolution {mm the
All Campus EPC, the laculty voted
to recommend that the Registrar
provide advisers of students with
a double major copies oi the per-
manent student record at the time»
the second major is declared. ,

Also approved was a suggestion
that the College stop issuing cum-
ulative grade point averages or
semester grade point averages on
student and parent copies at each
semester’s grade reports.

Strong opposition developed to a
recommendation that the dean’s list
be abolished. A motion was passed
recommending that the list be re»
tained.

Backers said the list provided ex-
cellent public relations because of
items published in hometown news-
papers of the students honored.

A recommendation that the College
no longer compute grade point av-
erages or student rankrinrclass was
deleated alter several laculty and st-
udents pointed out that most gradua-
te school and employment applica-
tions require the inlermation.
