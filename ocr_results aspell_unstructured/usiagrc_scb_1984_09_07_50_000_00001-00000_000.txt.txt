Harvard prof on U.S. policy

and politics

By David Altman and Eric (ji'ecli

President Reagan’s election-
year statements lavoring arms
control “are more sound than mo
tion" according to Joesph Nye.
who was at Gl'lnliell this week as
the college's Slst Rosent‘ield leer
turer.

Nye. who is a proiessor at Han
vard UniverSity's John F. Ken
nedy School of Government. can
siders the laiiui-e to negotiate an
arms control agreement to be a
major disappointment or the
Reagan administration. Nye lays
much of the blame for the lack of
negotiations on Reagan’s hawkish
appointees in the Departments or
State and Defense

In order to alter the course at
American arms control policy.
Nye believes Reagan must change
the personnel involved in the most
essential areas of policy forma
tion and negotiation. He noted that
most or the people currently in
volved with arms control issues
oppose such agreements.

If Reagan is reelected and does
not make substantial changes in
personnel, Nye believes that pro
gress toward arms agreements
would be slow.

Nye, who served as Deputy to
the Undersecretary of State for
Security Assistance Science and
Technology. said that it he were in
government. he would try to en
courage negotiations on limiting
weapons in outer space and work
to revive the now dormant talks
on tactical nuclear weapons in
Europe

He also supports tormer Vice.

annual USrSoviet' summit
meetings,

in general, Nye favors eiforts to
increase the capability of
American armed forces. But
Reagan has spent too much un-
wiseiy on his arms buildup, said
Nye, who believes the United
States should strengthen its con-
ventional forces, reserves and
supplies, rather than overspen-
ding on nuclear weapons.

Nye‘s dispositon tor increasing
our military preparedness in this
manner stems from his wary view
oi Soviet intentions in his impress
sions or “Communism's Doctrine
and the Ilislory of Russian ims
poi-iaiism.” Nye recognizes an ex-
government Nye
noted, though. that the Soviets do

not take risks unnecessarily,

In his latest book. The Making
of American Soviet Policy. he
argues that the American presi-
dent has had to diminish or
enlarge this Soviet caution. Since
public opinion shitts so gradually
in the United States. the president
in power has had to overstate his
position to bring public opinion
over to his side more speedily.
Nye says. This held truc ior Nixon
in his benign portrait of the
Soviets in 1973 and for Reagan's
threatening picture of the USSR in
the loads. Nye believes.

Straw poll yields

surprising results

By Leisa Cherie Kiletlle

Grinnell College’s election year
Straw»Vote conducted by William
Deminofi oi the Office of College
Relations has in years past at-
tracted a great deal of attention
outside the college

This year, the ballot produced
some surprising and some predjce
table results concerning the came
pus’s political interests.

As one might expect of Grinnell
College students, the Mondale-
rerraro ticket won by a subtantial
margin.

Out of a student body of approx-
iamtely 1200. 292 students. or one-
quarter of the total enrollment,
responded to the mail sample.
Another expected outcome oi the
Straw-Vote ballot was party
preference; 158 students iden-
tilled themselves as Democrat. 55
students identified themselves as
Independent, and iii students
prererred the Republican party

The startling aspect of the ballot
is in response to the topic. “1 con-
sider the following issue the most
important one racing the U.S. to-
day:”.

Sixtyrl'oui‘ oi the respondents
chose the economy tinflatlon.
unemployment), while 31 chose
budget deticits. only a chase ERA,
20 listed the environment. and 129
Grinnell College students picked
ioreign policy as the most Imporr
tant issue

It is generally believed that
those vote-- who are primaiily
concerned with the economic
issues such as unemployment and
inflation favor the Republican
ticket. speciiicaliy Reagan-Bush
and those voters who are primari-
ly concerned with the budget
deticits prercr the Democratic
ticket. iilondalerFe Taro

However. the G nnellians who
responded to this ballot showed
only a moderate interest in those
two areas and an overwhelming
interest in ioreign policy .

Mr, Hui‘witz of the political
science department whose
specialty is in public opinion sug
gests that. ”since students are not

in a taxable position. foreign
policy is a more salient issue,"

This interest in ioreign policy is
not entirely peculiar to the came
pus community. The Gallop Poll
and studies out of the University
or Michigan show similar trends.
according to Mr. Hurwitz.

Not only did ioreign policy can
cerns override pocketbook issues.
but it also supplanted the ERA
and the environment issues which
have long been concerns
characterizing the campus come
munity.

For a campus reputed as having
anactive ieminist community and
considering that 142 of the
respondents were women. the
allocation of only three votes for
ERA as the most pressing issue
may signify a changing tide of
concern.

Mr. Hurwitz explained that
when taking mail polls one preters
to have the highest response rate
possible Ordinarily, those who
respond tend to be very politically
motivated.

Consequently, the higher the
response rate, the more likely that
the poll is measuring the
mainstream of the community.

Mr. Hui‘witz implied that theie
was an adequate response rate to
the StrawVEallot poll, high enough
to assume that the data are
representative of the student
body He said a good response
rate in a mail poll is 1520 percent
and 25 percent of the student body
responded

The national election of law
prompted Mr. Deminofl to con»
duct the first StraweVote. Out of
644 respondents. Anderson won
with 51 percent of the vote. Carter
came in second wth 25 percent of
the vote and Reagan came in third
with 12 percent of the vote,

Immediately. the Associated
Press picked up the story as the
{list strawevote of the election
year and potentially indicative of
national trends. Even the Chroni-
cle of Higher Education wrote an
article on the outcome of Grinnell
College's lotto straw Ballot.
