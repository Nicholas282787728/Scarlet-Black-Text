B&G enters student rooms

by Phil Karmiri

On-Wednesday, Sept. 3, Paul Bethke
returned to his room in Read Hall at
l2205 p.m. after three hours of morning
classes. Bethke proceeded to take out
his key and unlock the door which he
had locked before leaving for classes.
As he reached to grab the door handle,
to steady it so as to put a key in the
keyhold, the door opened without
resistance. He looked towards the win-
dow, which was open, and saw an in-
lruding orange electric cord plugged in-
to an outlet. Unplugged were his radio
and study lamp.

Apparently the Building and Grounds
people had entered into Bethke’s room
to use his outlet for outside construction
work, The B&G violated Bethke’s rights
as stated in the Student Handbook
under Righu to Privacy: “Where the
college or its representative seeks ac-
cess to a student room while school is
in sssion, the resident shall soon be
notified oi such planned entry not less
than 24 hours in advance, and the resi-
dent shall be permitted to be present.”
When asked it he was given the 24 hour
warning, Bethke replied, “Nothing at
all."

Bethke further explained that he was
mad because there were two accessible
rooms- one that is empty in the base-
ment and a bathrooi'n on the first floor.
He said that me BhG had entered “
at least ﬁve rooms belore deciding on
my room." Another resident, Joe Mare
tin, said he was sleeping when several
Biro workers entered his room unan-
nounced. Martin said the workers left
without saying anything.

When asked about ,the actions. Dean
of Student Affairs 'Jim Tederman said
he was “concerned with the Physical
Plant entering without student notice.
Tederman went on to say that he talked
yith the Physical Plant about the inci»

dent and they iniormed him that the
reason why they did not use the empty
basement room is that the “windows
were jimmled and they could not get it
open.“ He added that the Physical
Plant claimed they asked Bethke on his
way out if they cuuld use the room.
when he was told about Tederman’s
comments Bethke immediately replied,
“That‘s a lie, there was nobody here at
the time. They asked the guy next door
to me.” Bethke's next door neighbor,
Jim York, said he was coming out or his
room at 9:50 am. when he saw the
maids and the 3er people come out of
Jim Rounsevell’s room down the hall.
The maid came up to York, who was in
a hurry to get to class, and said, “We
need m get a plug to run an extension
cord for outside in the back.” Jim
replied, ”You're going to go in anyway
so it doesn’t seem to matter." When
Jim returned from his class at 11:05

am, he expected to see a cord dangling
out oi his window, instead, he later
found Bethke in an uproar over the ac-
tions taken by the BhG.

When told about Bethke‘s statements,
Tederman reemphasized his points
and added, “We should always give
students a 24 hour notice. But students
must also show a little bit of leeway.
Each case should be looked at in»
dividually . . . and I'm not sure this
situation could have been avoided.”
Tederman went on to say that when you
are paying construction workers by the
hour one is hesitant to get a 24 hour
notice over a minor case like an outlet.

Bethke's linal words were full of em-
bitterment. “This should never have
happened. We would like a public
apology.”

Physical Plant Director Dale Hawn
was unavailable for Comment about the
incident.
