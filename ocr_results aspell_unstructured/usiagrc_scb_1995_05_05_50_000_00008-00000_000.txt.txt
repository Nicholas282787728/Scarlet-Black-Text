Can’t Talk, Eating!

away from the table at Mosquakr

last night. with his lnitilll two
dollars, he'd been at the Same table for
almost three hours. I-lejttst couldn‘t
stop,

Wc tried reasoning with him,
“You should be satisfied wrtll what
you‘ve got. Mostpeople would have
stopped by now," we said, but he
kept bringing home the bacon.
Mmmmmmm . bacon.

Let us explain. Yes. we were at
Mesquakl last night. but we refused to
gamble. The 24-hour al|»yourcanreatr

Some people don't believe you

you doubters wrong. He even had
the hangover the next morning to
prove it. His 6:00 am. pledge “I‘m
never eating again," lasted almost
two hours until the aroma ofbclgian
wafﬂe bar grabbed him by the olfac-
tory nerve and dragged him down
the loggia into Quad.

Now since we’re almost out of
ideas, weare goingtoupholdapledge
we made in our first column and
review breakfast by starting with a
wellrknown favorite. Every week
starts and ends with belgian wafﬂe
bar and fresh baked bagels. We like
to go to Quad because we can make
our own wafﬂes, although we sacrin
flee the whipped butter that they
serve at Cowles. You also get a
whole wafﬂe aI Quad rather than
just one half up North,

Since there is no whipped butr
ter, we’re forced to be creative. Jon
likes to smotherhis wafﬂes in maple
syrup and about 15-20 of those little
pats ofbutter. Sometimes, he builds
a house out of the butter and plays a
game he likes to call “Godzilla Der

Ir look all three of us to drag Jon

stroys Waffle World." At lastcount.
Jon (oops, \vc mcau “Godzillti") had
destroyed Waffle World over 100
times this semester.

Jed likes strawberries on his
waffles He brings his own colander
to get rid of thejuice that accumu—
lates wlttle they thaw underneath the
blitzing lights of the salad bar. The
game Jed plays with his breakfast is
called “Mothra Pupzttes.‘Y He starts
by wrapping the berries in the wax
paper left over front Jon’s butter.
The rest of the game would only be
understood by bio majors so that‘s
why he goes and plays with Matt.

Matt doesn’t like coffee, so In-
stead hedrinksrootbeerinthcmorn-
ing. After six or seven glasses he is
rcady tohalldle hiswafﬂcs. Helikes
to strap them to his hands and feet,
then pulls his shirt over his head and
goes from table to table saying, “I
am waffholio! lneed maple for my
wafeholel Are you threatening me?
Where I come from, there are no
waffles!"

Jason's is a simple, fun game.
Every morning, he comes in and
causes a ruckus about the wafﬂes.
“Wafﬂes? I thought you were serv—
ing falafels!" He then storms out in
a rage to confront McConnell, who
has learned to ignore him.

Sorry we didn't get to other
breakfasts, but we’ll see what we

asked ”I'lenc un novio?" (do you
have a boyfriend) on an almost daily
basis fevery time I met a new family
member. Then I was introduced to a
cousin,Mauricio. We chattedbrieﬂy,he
mentioned something about going out
dancing. Isaid yes.

He came back the next day, and,
mysteriously, the rest of the family dis

managed to instantaneously serve up
dinner for the two of us.
