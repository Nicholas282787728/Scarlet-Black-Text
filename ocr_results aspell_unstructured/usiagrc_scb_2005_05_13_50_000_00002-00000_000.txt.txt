NEWS BRIEFS

Administrators, SGA dis-
cuss changes to lock-
down policy

In recent weeks, students and administrators
have been talking about Cndlng the college’s policy
of perpetual lockdown for next year, Mark Gardiner
‘05 recently met with President Osgood about the
processes the College undertakes when it enacts new
policies. According to SGA Vice President RcbcCca
Miller ‘05, that meeting raised Osgood's interest in a
further discussion of the issue. Miller said that Osr
good talked to Tom Cmdy, vice president for Student
Services. Crady then organized a meeting between
liimselﬁjenuifer Krohu. dean for Student Life. SGA
President Mark Henry/‘05, Gardiner and Miller where
they discussed the possibility of amending lockdown
to bejust during evening hours.

At a recent Joint Board, senators relayed informa-
tion back from their constituents regarding the look.
down issue. Senators brought back mixed opinions,
although a majority of students interested in the issue
seemed to side with maintaining the current lock
down policy, Miller said.

The debate centers on the need for a sense ofsafe-
ty as opposed to the need for a sense of community,
whieh some students feel is lacking under the Current
policy. “It is an important discussion to have,"Miller
said. “Students need to feel comfortable in their living
environments either way."

The possibility oflockdow’n policy Chmigcs could
he a main issue next year. According to Henry,“1t’s
something that [President-elect] John Bohman [‘06]
and [Vice-President»elect] Chris Ochoa [‘06] are go—
ing to look into next year." Crady also said that any
changes will come next year after an evaluation ofstu-
dent opinion. “We are going to form a group next year
to see what students mm to do," Crady said.
