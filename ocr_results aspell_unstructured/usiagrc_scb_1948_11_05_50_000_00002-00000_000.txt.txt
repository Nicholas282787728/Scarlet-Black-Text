and national aspects, which can be

political, religious, and cultural mover
ments of a progressive nature, and to
foster and encourage those which are

college as such.

rAGE TWO,

‘ Comment

There are occurring in this country cer-
tain events which we believe to be embryonic
elements of thought control; \\e have indicated
two of those elements on this page recently un-
der the heading No Comment.

We finfl communists, real or alleged, callr
ed before a congressional committee to answer
for their political convictions; an estabished
liberal magazine banned from the New York
schools; an impending “purification" of social
science teachers and textbooks in Chicago
schools.

This inspection of opinions is being car-
ried on by school supervisors and boards, com-
mittees of Congress and the American Legion,
and other self-appointed ”citizens of unques~
tioned loyalty.” To what are these citizens
loyal? Certainly not to tlle provisions of the
First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the
Constitution,

There is little point in protecting the
“American Way of Life" if that way of life is
to be perverted and polluted by America’s ace
ceptance of extra-judicial stigmatization and
thought control.

South Campus Says

Look, Fellows-

Take off your coat, honey, and toss it over
a sofa, Teeter on your heels and chat chum-
mily with the gli awhile. Cast a glance, if
you will, at the men who stand about the club
rooln moodily waiting until the soup is on.

Then make wayithe poor boys are hun-
gry. Shall we wait for the fellows who are
lingering shyly behind ?

But let‘s consider kindly what a cross
these men bear, acting as hosts at this dinner
exchange. And remember, too, that there’s
nothing finer for the digestion than a meal
eaten in silent concentration.

An exaggerated picture? Perhaps, for the
majority of women, but certainly the plight of
an unhappy few, who won’t really mind Walk-
in;r back en masse to the Quad,

This isn‘t a matter for Emily Post; simp-
ly a case for garden courtesy, the kind that
would make north campus dinners lnore than
simply a hike for a meal.
