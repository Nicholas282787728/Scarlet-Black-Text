0 HE'S THE STRANGEST FELLA

He is a queer chap, isn‘t he‘.7 He never seems
to conform. It isn‘t that he’s exactly what
you would call a misfit Just a sort of freak.

Take his ties, for instance. Where he
gets them, I don‘t know. But they all re-
mind you of a doting maiden aunt. The
most peculiar combinations and not the least
in good taste. Someone really should tip him
off about Esquire, because he probably just
doesn’t know any better.

And his friendyvif that is what he calls
them. How can any self-respecting individ-
ual be content to be seen with that mob?
Especially that girlfriend of his. She’s
just about the drabbest person I can imagine.
What in blazes he can see in her is frankly
beyond my comprehension. Why, she hasn’t
evenioh well, what‘s the use.

Saturday, April

But what really takes the cake is the
stuff he’s taking this semester.

Honestly, old man, it's the driest junk.
And he’s always poking around in some
stuffy old books, trying to find out some-
thing about it. Say he’s crazy about the
subject and wants to make it his life’s work.
Actually going to take all the courses in it
he can get. He must be a little cracked.

And think of his politics. He actually
believes that that bum his party is running
is the best candidate and that his program
is the best thing for the country. How he
can swallow that tripe and believe it is be»
yond me. Just plain bias and sloppy thinks
ing. You would think that anyone with as
much intelligence as he's supposed to
possess would recognize the facts in the
case. Everyone of any brains at all knows
that our man is far and away the best.

Who is this fella?

Why, that guy over thereithe “other"

0. HOW ABOUT lT, HONOR ‘6'?

According to the recent campus election re-
turns, that oft-maligned organization, the
Honor “G,” has at last succeeded in divest—
ing itself of the odors of the past.

of the eight newly-chosen men govern-
ing officers, six are members of the club.
Moreover, the Honor ”G," itself, has in-
stalled a new administration which gives
every promise of vigorous and intelligent ac-
tion. From this it would seem that both the
club and the campus»at—larg'e has placed a
new confidence in the organization, a belief
that it has renounced the last remnants of
its past somewhat unsavoury reputation to
its past somewhat unsavory reputation to

Nor do we feel that that confidence is
misplaced or premature

Throughout the past year, the Honor
“G" has taken firm and definite strides in
its escape from its bleak record of the
earlier 1930’s, the greatest of which steps
being its Christmas collection for the under
privileged. ’

But next year should be even greater—
greater for Grinnell athletics as a whole
and greater for Gt-innell letterlnen in partic-
ular. The Honor “G” club is entitled to a
position of respect and reasonable author-
ity on the campus. And a continuation of
its present outlook can not help but assure
it just that.

"Ghosi Writing" Disapprovecl

AUSTIN, Texas, .April 13*“Ghost
writing," the practice of prcpnp
ing themes and repors for some
one else: class work, gets a
thumbssdown expression of opin-
ion from three—fourths of Ameri-
can college students. What may
be more surprising to some, hows
ever, is that the other fourth is
either indifferent or openly in ape
proval.

Chapel Program

The chapel program for next
week is:

Sunday—Vespers: John Du-
sheill Stoops, professor of
philosophy, will speak.

Monday: Shelton L. Beat-
ty, dean of men, will speak.

Tuesday: Music.

chncsdny: Joseph w.
Charlton, nssocin‘te professor
of economics, will speak.

Thursday: Mrs. Muck T.
Henderson will give a short
piano recital.

Friday: student chapel.

“What is your opinion of the
practice of students paying ghost
writers to prepare themes and
term papers for them?," was the
question presented to a scien . c
cross section from coast to coast.

Answers to the query were
tabulated by the interviewers in
five different categories to indi»
cate the intensity of feeling on
this issue. These results are given
below:

Strongly opposed
Mildly opposed

The chief argument of those

who favor ghost writing is that
in effect it often helps students

~ by giving them more timc to

pressing courses. On the other
hand, the maid ty of those op~

lastic dishonesty.
