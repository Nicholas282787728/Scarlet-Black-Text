KGRW Broadcasts
Ahead of Schedule

All 15 of the new KGRW
transmitters are installed and
operating in the halls. They
were installed by .the statiun’s
engineering crew five weeks
ahead of schedule, A crystal
was received this week which,
according to Al liitc, station
managcr, should do much to
lock the transmitters on to their
assigned frequencies. Alter the
installation at this crystal toe
morrow most of the extraneous
noises should be eliminated,

According to Fritz, the
Grinnell dorms- are construct.
cd somewhat unusually in
that the amount or steel in
the buildings' structures is
uneven. The rooms with the
most steel around them have
the worst reception.

Two years ago. KGRW was
broadcasting with just one
transmitter in the studio, but
the signal covered outlying
areas as well as the collegc.
since the station was licensed
by the FCC lor campus cover
ago only, it was forced to go
off the air.

1(an cannot always be
picked up at 6'85 kilo es.
its assigned frequency, since
all radios are not calibrated
precisely the same. The sta—
tion may be picked up iii
where from 650450.
Tomorrow KGRW will run
auditions from in pm [or
those interested in broadcasting
or in any other function of the
