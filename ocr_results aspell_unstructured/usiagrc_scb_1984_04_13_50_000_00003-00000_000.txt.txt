The $29

National Character

by Patrick O'Neill

The second of the panel discus-
sion entitled “Sports and the Na-
tional Character," was opened by
Harry Edwards with what he calla
ed the first law of Sports
Sociology: “Sports inevitably
reflects society.” He said that the
lack of integrity in sports is a
reflection upon our society.

Edwards feels that a combina
tion Of myths, money and a mania
over winning has bankrupted our
virtues such as honesty and
Courage. He said. “College
presidents and Chancellors have
revealed themselves to be among
the most gutless and spineless in-
dividuals that we can imagine
giv the character of the respon-
sib ties that they have in this
situation.”

Such individuals are responsis
ble in part for the “systematic
creation” of jocks, according to
Edwards. He Said that nobody ex-
pects anything more from an
athlete other than athletic periors
mance and the result is that they
are “locked into a kind of athletic
nosman’s land that's doomed to
end in a dead end."

In sports as in society, the em-
phasis is on winning and money,
According to Edwards, what it
will take to come out of this em,
phasis is “some courage and some
understanding." He found both to
be present at the symposium.

Alan Page agreed with Ed
wards‘ attack on the business
aspect of athletics. But he also
placed some ol the blame on the
fans for their seemingly un—
warranted fanatical support of
athletic games. Page asked of the
fans, “Where has the perspective
gone?" ‘ " ‘

Page also made a distinction
between the athlete on the ﬁeld
and the athlete off the field. He
said that money may not have “a
great deal of impact on the play-
ing field.” He said that in many
cases the athlete's motives are not
changed by the money involved,

John Underwood. senior writer
for Sports illustrated and late ar-
rival to the panel discussion,
believes mat sports have been
polluted by two influences: pro
fessionalism and television. He
also said that the athletes feel
alienated by team management,
and the fan perceives today‘s
sports as being played by athletes
who ultimately don‘t care.

Nevertheless, by frequently tur»
ning into sports on television and
by paying at the gate, said Under-
wood, the [an ultimately feeds the
problem. Like Edwards. Under
wood felt that colleges are getting
“sucked" into the evil of profes»
sionalism.

Concerning the media’s role in
sports, Bob Martin, president of
the National Sportcasters and
Sportswriters Association, said
that the media is intimately tied to
the money involved in sport. In—
stead of being an objective
messenger of an event, it has
made media personalities (eg.
Howard Cosell) bigger than the
game itself. Again, the fans
perspective is lost in the
unrealistic hype of the game.

The Politics of Sport

by Ellen Z. Piekalkiewicz

The Olympic games were the
topic of a forum entitled “The
Olympics: Myth and Reality"
whose panel included Christine
Grant. Roger Bannister, Billy
Mills, Chris Chataway, and Bob
Martin (moderator).

Grant, women‘s athletic direc-
tor at the University of Iowa and a
former member of the u S. Olyma
pic Committee, spoke of her
dismay that the athletes at the

.constituents,

Chicago Bears

Olympics are “pawns or a giant
chess game. the game of world
politics." This reality. she added.
“threatens the future of the
games,"

The Olympic ideal of “drawing
nations together in mutual
respect” is not accomplished
because few people really unders-
land Olympicism, she said.

She added, ”Each Constituent
group (the governments. the
media. the spectators, and the
athletes) uses sports for their own
ends."

Grant, however. believes the
“Olympic ideals are worth strive
ing for.” Through education of the
“The ideal that
brotherhood transcends all can be
emphasized.”

Bannister said he is concerned
with the “problems of size and the
site” of the Olympics.

He said. “The Olympics are
becoming too big. . . but it is an ins
evitable tendency for the games to
get bigger and bigger.” Speaking
to a possible permanent site for
the games, he said, “The only
solution is to set a semi-
permanent site on each
continent."

Underwood. senior writer for
Sports illustrated, said the loss of
integrity at the Olympics. through
the use of drugs, and payments
under the table, is what bothers
him the most. He said. “We need
good sportsmanshipl "

Billy Mills, gold medal winner
in the 10.000-meter run in the 1964
games, and who was inducted into
the Olympic Hall of Fame Mons
day. reminisced about his ex»
periences at the Olympics.

Mills, a Sioux Indian, said
before he started running he
‘r‘fountL himself without a
philosophy." Through running, he
explained. he found the “perspec-
tive of who the) was.”

“I didn't go to die Olympics to
win but to reach deep into my
Capabilities," he said. “1 par»
ticipaled in total innocence. . . At
the games I saw people meeting
people from all over the world."

He added. “This was a very
beautiful and naive experience. . .
. and unfortunately the pursuit of
the gold has clouded that vision.”

He explained that to him “the
gold medal was insignificant”
compared to his 15-year struggle
towards perfection in running,
which brought him to have a “bet
ter understanding of (himself) as
a human being.”

Chataway, the cynic of the
panel and setter of a world record
in the 5.0t)t)~meter run in 196%
Said, “The ideals of the Olympics
are impossible ideals. , . and are
not asked even of artists, poets, or
actors.”

He added, “Why should they be
expected of athletes.” Chataway
explained, “Sportsmen are going
to be no better than the rest of us.”
The only justification the Olym-
pics needs, he said, is that it is a
chance for the “best of the world
to compete against each other.”

He added, “I urge everyone to
look at the Olympics for what it is
7 the greatest sports event in the
world.”

Imateur vs. Pro

by Billy Strean

Not even the panelists
themselves may have realized
just how appropriate their discus»
sion of the amateur Versus profes-
sional issue was.

cerns will be considered as a US.

more traditional sense of
“amateurism”, the Gault lawsuit
would open the Olympics to pro-
fesslonals.

Forest Evashevski. the former
Iowa football coach. addressing
the problem of growing profes»
sionalisrn in intercollegiate
athletics, said he believes that the
way to keep the academic stan-
dards up is to not lower academic
admission standards and to force
athletes to get a degree. EvashevV
ski commented that a great deal
of the problems arise because
stated aims and objectives in the
programs are lacking.

“i am saddened by the present
scene", added Sir Roger Ban-
nister. He said that looking at the
current principles, the athletes
are professional, if not in receivV
ing money, but in commitment of
time. Bannister. who said he felt
lucky to be around at a time when
one only had to train three
quarters of an hour a day to be a
world record holder, believes that
the aim of sports would be to give
all a fair chance to compete.

He maintains that an athlete
needs a counterbalance to his
training. which will make his
training more efficient and en
joyable.

Christine Grant. director Of
women's athletics at Iowa. gave
some examples of what an
“amateur” has to do today. Grant
expressed Concern about these
athletes who are putting in more
hours of training than most
Americans put in for their fulls
time jobs. The US. Women’s
Junior National Volleyball Team,
for example, puts in six to eight
hours per day of training.

Grant added that amateurs are
really just paid less and later.

The athletes‘s perspective was
given by all-pro football player
Alan Page, who said mat he was
never able to see the difference
between amateurs and pros. The
distinction, Page believes, is in
the level of competition, rising
from high school to the pros. Yet.
Page contends the enthusiasm,
pride and love of the game are
equal. For Page, the true amatuei-
is one who competes for and
against himself.

He added that the colleges and
universities should make their
number one priority educauon.
Page drew applause from an au-
dience of students, press,
townspeople, and professionals in
the field when he commented,
”This is one I shouldn’t touch. but
I wi . We have a debate going
now on prayer in school. when are
we going to get down to a national
debate on education in school?"

However. one of the wittiest of
Page's comments was his
response to the issue of athletes
such as Gault being granted
amateur status: “I sure hope they
resolve this in time for the 1988
Calgary games; because I'd like
to compete in the'luge". . . ~
