Life
Small

in a
Town:

Is there more
than fresh a1r?

By C Black and S. Bachmann
The last thing i remembered was going
down to the Pub Friday afternoon after I

wished my homeward bound friends goods -

bye, The next morning, I shuffled out of
my room into an eerie silence punctuated
by overturned, empty cardboard boxes
and various pieces oi trash leit or iorgot-
ten in the hallway: my introduction to an
unremitting summer oi throbbing
boredom. I learned the hard way (the way
most stubborn people learn) that Grinnell
is insuiiicient tor a megalopolitan college
student to play “Let’s Be independent and
Get a Job and Pay Rent."

At iirst glance, Grinnell might seem to
be a busy, selfacontained network of hard-
working proletarians, but underneath the
patchwork quilt of activity lies the wide
eyed insomlnac (and counting sheep only
makes it worse). The daytime Grinnell is
no problem ior those who have jobs that
keep their minds irom wandering out into
wide-open spaces leaving diem vulnerable
to attack by Pat Sajack, Vanna White and
the dramatis personage oi eery single soap
opera. But those who work as, let's say, a
waitras may have some difficulty idling
away the time. One could shop in the Cen-
.tral Business District (l.e., the two blocks
which constitute the hubbub of city living
in Grinnell), but you can trudge through
Rainbow‘s End only so many times in one
day without the money to buy anything.
Nevertheless, one could sleep during the
day and revel in the crisp, star-laden Iowa
atmosphere in the dead of night; but the
chilled stillness illuminated by Main
Street’s orange glow inhibits breathing,
much less laughing, dancing and a zest for
life. Not that Grinnell isn’t zesty. You
know there are the Virile, if not vile, men
on motorcycles who swarm around the
same block seven or eight times before
pausing to spit,

But where does that leave the weary
pedestrian longing for a concert in the
park, or an all—day stroll through town
without seeing the same thing twice? our
ing the day, on the soia staring out of the
window; at night, in bed, staring at the
ceiling, with an oscillating ian drying out
your eyeballs.

About Face

Moving irom my home town to the town
of Grinnell took about as much adjustment
as it takes to change a pair of socks; in
other words, the change was minor. You
see, I herald from a town of about 7,000 in
western Iowa, where the corn, and the
temperatures, and the billboards are all
about the same as in Grinnell. The

’similarities of the towns have brought to
my attention, however some of the unique
qualities of Grinnell that make it a
beautiful place to live, both on and off cam~
pus.

It is my beliei that the maxim, “The
more things change, the more they stay
the same," was coined by someone getting
philosophical over a cup oi coffee at Cunn-
ingham’s Drug Store, Grinnell seems to
have a talent for changing with the times
while continuing to uphold tradition. For
instance. the college experiences new
students, revised policies, and advanced
technology year aiter year, while holding
the approximately l50-year-old codes oi
honor and academics. Downtown Grinnell
is changing the fronts of stores and giving
shoppers, students, visitors, and residents
a “new look ” But the service and
friendliness are still that of Iowa's earliest
settlers, much like you‘d see on “Little
House On the Prairie." Striking a balance
between old-fashioned values and contem-
porary ideals takes a talent indeed.

Grinnell also has a good name.
Figuratively speaking, or course, but the
mere name “Grinnell" makes one think of
strength as well as comiort. Near my
small hometown was an even smaller town
by the name oi “Westside” and yet a
smaller town called “Buck Grove." To an
outsider, these towns sound suspiciously
like suburbs. Their very names convey a
weak, Subordlnate character. “Grinnell"
sounds as it its past is solid, its future, in
finite.

The best part about the small Iowa farm,
ior me, is that a person can reel the grass
under their feet and see the stars above
their head and actually breathe the air for
extended periods of time. Of course these
features are dimmed by the realities of
snow over the grass, clouds over the stars,
and an occasional “farm odor" in the air,
But all things considered, Grinnell offers
the best. If I yearn for a faster pace, more
crowded streets, and more activity, there
are plenty oi large cities that are periect . .

for visiting.

The town and college have a lot to ofler,
much like my old home. And it is easy to
feel proud of a place such as Grinnell
because the individual (you, me, etc.l
makes up such a large percentage oi the
population! Small towns are something to
experience, and l ieel iortunate to have
gone irom one to another. My hometown
even had a college in the late 1960's, but it
went bankrupt due to embezzlements. i
guess not all small towns can be a Grins
nell!

Life in a Northern
Dorm

By Karin Sedestrom

I'd like to say that this originally began
as a ieature on Quiet Hall that got expand~
ed into a series of articles on North Cams
pus Dorms. So, I will be doing said series
throughout the coming issue of the Scarlet
and Black. here with Younker Hall. Don’t
worry, South Campus, your turn is com-
ing.

Younker Hall has the distinction of being
the biggest dorm on campus. (Wowl)
Although most of the floors are co—ed by
room, North Younker Pit is female and
South Younker Third is male. (I wonder
who decides these things?) It was built in
1550, which you can iind out by looking at
the space over the door, Younker has a
laundry room (great to hang out in with a
radio other people who have nothing better
to do) and a computer terminal room

Now for the interesting stuff — what do
people think oi Younker?

Steve Langerud, the RA. for Smith and
Younker, has a high opinion oi his new
home, He says that he and his wife, Karen
Veerhuseanangerud, llke it here because
the students “are considerate of us and
each other.” He thinks that the dorm is
“enthusiastic", as evidenced by all the
people who collected for and hosted the
Younker T-shirt and Tie Party during New
Student Days, all without an R.H,A,_to
organize them. According to Steve,
Younker is “interested in putting on big
programs", so we'd all better watch out,

is Younker a “party dorm”? Everyonc I
talked to denied it, but the day after these
interviews were held, toilet paper was all
over the Pit. l-lmm, Anyway, as you up-
perclassmen know, it there was an all-
campus party held in past years, chances
are it was in Younker. I’m told that it was
rather a nice setup, with the dance iloor on
First and the keg in the basement,
Because Of recent renovations (new
carpeting, redone bathrooms, etc.), Stu-

dent Affairs encouraged the parties to be
held in Gardner Lounge; it would be too
expensive to repair any damage that
“might" occur in Younker. I found this out
from Jennifer Shimer, a former Younker
S.A. now the R,H,A. for Loose Hall. She
Says, ”The renovations have made it a lot
more appealing for upperclassmen,"
although there are mostly freshmen there.
(IS that because it’s so big?) This allegedly
makes it more rowdy than, say, South
Campus, where there are more up-
perclassmen. (Does anyone care to
dispute this?)

Cindy Jones is one oi the many, the pro-
ud, the Younker freshmen. She describes
her dorm as “outgoing" (where is it gua
ing”) and knows that Younker has
previously also been primarily a ireshman
dorm. The stafl'Z? “My SA. is terrific, but
I would feel comfortable going to any of
the other S.A.'s.” She thinks Steve is "very
concerned about our being happy and
makes you feel wanted,” and adds, “I love
living there."

Dave Eberbach, a sophomore living on
North Younker Third, commented that
Younker is “active” and “a young dorm",
and said that “If you want to live on North
Campus, Younker is the place. It’s close to
classes, the P,E.C., the Forum and the
library; everything except Cowles,” which
isn‘t that important unless your hie
revolves around college food. He likes
Younker’s size; “its big, you’re always
meeting new people." Dave also adds to
the praise already heaped i... Younker
staff, "The SrA.‘s are friendly, they know
each other from last year and they work
well together." He's impressed with Steve
and characterizes him as “knowledgeable,
willing and eager to do his job as RA.”

it looks like pretty much everybody ap-
proves oi Younker. It's big, its clean, it's
friendly and it's renovated.

And no more gang showers!

Life in Faith

By ChristineI Black

li you are a PEC regular at the pool,
you could run into Leslie Taylor. But this
avid lapaswimmer isn’t just in great
ph sical shape, she’s also in great
sp ’tual shape as well. She happens to be
me Intern Chaplain oi Grinnell College
while Chaplain l-iaas is on sabbatical.

Chaplain Taylor graduated irom Grin-
nell in 1581 with a degree in English and a
background in Theatre. Before attending
Grinnell, Taylor was not a church-going
person. while in school here, she en-
countered dogmatic, but not pushy, honest
Christians; “the people here actually lived

their faith. They didn’t just attend church
on Sunday and sin on Monday." As a result
oi her positive religious experiences, she
joined the United Church of Christ. This
particular religion iunctions mainly
through the local autonomies of each
association (similar in theory to Catholic
parishes). Through intricate procedures,
the associations gather together to
preview candidates for ordination.

Even though women can be ordained, it
is more difficult for women than men to
rind jobs. Women are primarily given
education positions instead oi preaching or
administrative work. It is especially difa
flcult for Chaplain Taylor because she is
not only a black woman, but also a single,
politically active youth.

Aside from her strong ties to Grinnell,
her decision to return was due also to
Chaplain Haas. She didn't go through an
application process; instead, she was
recommended and urged by Haas to take
the position. Taylor acknowledged that his
support was a critical iactor in her
decisionamaking process.

As a chaplain, a few of her duties include
coordinating and leading worship services
and counseling, Her experiences as a
substance abuse counselor. as a counselor
on a rape hot line and a suicide prevention
hot line, and as a pregnancy prevention
counselor qualify her to dcal with college
students problems. .

Chaplain Taylor loves to chat and is
looking forward to becoming more involv-
ed in the compo»
