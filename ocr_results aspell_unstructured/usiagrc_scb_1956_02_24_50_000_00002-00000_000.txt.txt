Rapid Developments

The announcement and ”in spirit" approval of the C
of HP’s new constitution was rapid Two days were alloted
to the entire operation. After its announcement, the constie
tiltion produced a snow-balling movement toward student
unityi Representatives of all three governing bodies are
presently taking an active part in this movement The re-
sulting confusion was regretable, for the constitution’s
spirit, in the minds of C of HP members was modified. —

Tuesday night’s llousemeetings on North Campus
were apparently supposed to convey the modification in
spirit. In some cases, this was done, but in others it was
not, producing more confusion.

Constitutions are lasting documents. It is now uncer-
tain how far the C oil-1P will push its new constitution
In the light of present developments, we wonder if the
emphasis still might lie in the wrong direction. If the C of
HP pursues the constitution without specifically allowing
room for a unified student government, and should the
unity movement becomes successful, the constitution will
become obsolete before it serves its purpose.

Greater cooperation between League Board, C of HP
and Student Council has now developed. We hope C of HP
members will continue this cooperative spirit, when they
reconsider the new constitution. ,

Undoubtedly most of the stu-

something important occured this
week and that it has to do with
student government. But prob-
ably only a small minority, until
now, had a knowledge of what
was actually being done and how
it all started, » ,

movement among the bodies
of student government toward
attempting unified student
government, Although the idea
of unified government has
been kicked around, particu-
larity among the student gov.
erment officers all year, on-
ly beginning early this week
has there been deiirdle mu-
tual actioul taken in consider
ing this possibility,

Monday night the 'c of HP
presented to the men for con-
sideration a revamped, tbut ten-
tative, constitution of men’s
government. The plan had many
excellent progressive improve-
ments and the general outline
was very acceptable to most of
the men. But there were some

details of the convention.)

By S. Dedallls MacDonald
This is a great year for conventions—everybody who’s
anybody is having them, and Grinnell is no exception.

Because the convention‘s function is to limit the num-

ber of candidates for Student

because there were only two candidates last year,

has two classes which have
never witnessed or taken part
in a convention. with four hats
in the ring, a convention this
year is assured, and all of us
will have a chance to observe
one of the strangest political
conglomerations ever assembled.

On March 3, at about noon,
Darby ‘symnasium will be
transformed into Darby Con-
vention hall. Tumbling nuts,
parallel bars and hackhoarﬂs
will be replnced ,.by micro-

phones, posters, signs and
delegates

This week each ball will elect
its delegates, at the rate of one
per each four persons. In theory,
the delegates are chosen at ran
dam in the halls, then "instruct:
ed" on the first ballot by a vote
taken in the hall. For example,
if a hall has 20 members, it will
elect five delegates, who will
be told which candidate to vote
for in the first ballot. After the
first ballot, the delegates are on
their own.

In reality the delegates are
usuaUy pledged way in ad.
vance. Supporters of Candidate
Y see to it that as many (if
their group as possible are
chosen. Each hall also selects
a. delegate chairman, who
supervises the delegation at
the convention. Alternates are
also chosen, in case the regu-
lau- delegalos are unable to
attend,

The convention is supervised
by the Election Board; student
Council President Ken Kasse-
bani-n will preside. He will open
the convention with a summary
of the rules which the election
board has drawn up, and then
the nominating will begin. If
pm traditions are followed, the
halls will be called in alpha-

Council president to two, and
Grinnell

helical order and given a chance
to nominate any candidate who
has filed a petition.

This year the board has
ruled that each candidate will
be allowed fifteen minutes £0
present whatever it is he ieels
needs to he presented—includ-
ing his nominating and sec-
onding address and any “dent.
onstrating" which may ensue.

After the nominations, the
balloting begins. As soon as two

,candidates receive 35% of the
delegates who are present, the
convention is over.

it appears that there are
seVeral “jag" candidates in the
running as usual this yenr,
out they play a more impore
ant part in the convention
than one might suspect. For
one thing, the "tags" are re-
sponsible for a. good deal of
the convention‘s color. In the
past, “jag” delegations have
presented themselves bedeched
in exotic costumes; their
speeches are usually riotous
and their “spontaneous" dem-
onstrations often have a beau-
tifully timed and well-engi-
neered flavor of chaos

But the “jags” are important
in another Sense; when they get
tired of playing, their votes are
suddenly available to the serious
candidates, whose managers and
floor chairmen traditionally
beg, plead, and barter franti-
cally to gain these extra votes.

If you like to dabble in stu<
dent politics, like to double-
cross your friends, and don’t
mind your former “best pals"
not‘speahing to you for a few
days, get yourself elected as a
delegate. At any rate, go to the
convention and watch the fun.

KGRW hopes to be back on
the air in time to broadcast the
affair.

Larrabee Opinion

The idea of unified student
government for Grinnell has
been a Concern of government
leaders for some time. i am
very hopeful that this year a
system of unified government
can be formulated which will
be satisfactory to the student
body, the faculty and the ad-
ministration. My optimism
stems from the fact that our
three governmental bodies, the
c of HP, the Student Council
and the League Board, are all
cooperatively working toward a
uniﬁed governmental system,
The Student effort toward uni—
fication is also greatly encour-
aged by the motion of the Stuv
dent Organizations committee
last Wednesday to “support at-
tempts to establish unified stu-

dent government."

The present campus—wide
movement for student govern-
ment unity shows that the chin-
nell student is sincerely inter-
ested in improving the present
system. I definitely think pmA
gress has been made in me slpe-
cial committee which has been
devised to draw up a campus
unity structure. This is no helli-
hearted attempt by a few peo-
ple but it is a sincere and earn—
est movement which the great
majority of Grinnell students are
behind, The special committee
is well aware of the numerous
difficulties which stand in the
way or a unified program; get-
ting an equal and fair repre-
sentaltion of both north and
south campuses on a central
governing body; setting up a
satisfactory judicial system; and
defining the exact powers of
each governmental body are
only a few of the problems. The
committee reels, however, that
with the cooperation and path
cnce of the students, a worlcaiblc,
satisfactory solution can and will

be found.

Council Establishes
Librarvaes‘l' File;

student Council voted to re—
quest that the faculty set up a
file of tests in the library so

that professors would not be
able to repeat tests, and changed
the mnstitutio to place the
Student Cou presidential
elections in the lust two weeks
of February, at its meeting last
rght.

The library file of tests
was viewed as a way to cut
down cheating and place all
students on the same lion's for
a test. The council also ap-
proved a pledge that students
would write on their tests after
they had finished: To my
knowledge there has been no
cheating on this examination.
Student Council election next

year was moved up to help out
various groups on campus who
must await its outcome before
they can go ahead with elecA
tinns of their own.

At a special meeting called
last Friday, Council recommend-
ed. to Kassebaum that he not
accept resignations tendered by
the three central committee
members on the Election Board.
