One Bond. Fide Sophomore Untied
at End of Battle Brings Vic»
tory to His Glass.

Through the strategy of one of their
new men, the sophomores were a-
gain triumphant in the annual class
scrap, staged on the open space in
front of the dormitories Tuesday mor-
ning. Van Horn, .1 sophomore trims-
fer, had been taking his prepping in
Smith Hall with the rest of the fresh,
and had spent the night wtth the
preps, helping tie up his own class
mates. l-iis class standing was not
questioned by the freshmen or their
junior advieors.

The night prelinus to the big light
was marked by the capture of foul»
teen Sophomores, who remained tied
up throughout the night. The second
year men spent the night all over town
in various places, While the props
enjoyed life and sandwiches over on
East Street. Their several raiding
parties were successful.

When the actual sci-up started at six
the first year men managed to
tie the sophs in something less than
ten minutes, so unusual record. In-
dividual scraps broke out here and
there during the rest of the period,
but were easily settled by the larger
number of freshmen. NinEty-itwo
sophomores competed with one bun-
tired and twelve preps, according to
the scrap committee.

Stunt Given

The feature of the afternoon was a
stunt given by the girls of the W. A.
A. board, representing "The Annual
Gym Demonstration of 1349." The
performers all were costumes of the
period, and the extremely mild and
ladylike exercise they indulged in was
uproariouriously funny.

tei-pi-ctation oi‘ the role of Miss Soph-
ronia Prim, director of the gym
classes, A number of prizes were
given to the champions in each sport;
Elsie Stanfier won the championship

‘pices of Bob Eaton, provided a satis-
'[z‘ctory tints can be secured from
‘Ernest Briggs, the Sarg booking a.
gent, who is coming to complete the
arrangements.

 

The new niarionottes are presenting

romance, and “Hansel and Gretel" at
the matinee. They have just finish»
Ted a run at the Belascc Theatre in
New York. Thcii- u-estcru tour is
rather short, and they are stopping
.at only the larger cities, but it is
thought possible that Gi-iiinell may
secure them.

“Don Quixote” is probably the most
}faiuous of Sarg's pupet plays, this
is its second season, although it has
never before been out of New York.
The matinee performance is entirely
now, being composed of a series of
short mai-ionette plays.
