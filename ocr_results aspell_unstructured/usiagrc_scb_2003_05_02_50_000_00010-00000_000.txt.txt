Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome leads Grinnell to bring four students

by Leslie Boyadjian

Earlier this Semester, an epidemic known as Severe
Acute Respirarory syndrome (SAKS) swepr China and
brought rour Grinnell srudcnrs abruptly homo from rheir
study abroad programs in Beijing and Nanjing.

ARS is a resplrarory disease rhar has provcn rural to
people all over China. Shortly error the ourbrenk, roor
Grinnell jumors, Coco Downey, Sarah Gosserr, Jusrin
McCollum and Elise Pizzi, were contacted by Grinnell and
told to return home.

This was in accordance with the
college’s Travel Warnrng policy,
which states “in use: \thmaTmVel
warning is issued while a program
is in progress, a decision ro with.
draw students from the country
may be made bored on rhc advice
orrhe us. Depnrrmem orsmre."

Bcaiisc their programs weroso
abruptly ended, Gosserr.
McCollum und Downcy found
themselves wondering whrtt ro do
for the rest of the semester Piui
elected to mite the {Lit ofthc sc-
mmcr off. All four students were
icrr wondering what to do about
their lrisr credits.

Grinnell offered them partial credit for the courscs they
had Conlplclcd, but they were still ltfl without both the
remaining credits and rho colrure they hnd been immersed
in for several months.

While Gossctt, McCollum and Downcy now under-
srmd why irwusso important rhey return, McCollum said
ir seemed “very ambiguous" while they were still in China.
The Chinese media seemed rn be keeping the epidemic
under wraps, he said, and what the siudcnn heard about
the disease came from American media and frantic calls
from home.

All ihrccstudcnis who me hack [0 Grinnell expressed
their frustration with the way the situation was handled.

“I’m really actually very engry,” said Downey. “were
all very angry."

Initially, them was a lo: ofconfusion, which added to
the students’ {rustmtlonr McColIum said it seemed like
everyone was “more concerned about the lrnbiliry.

“It seems like they have no idea what U) do with ”5‘”

"It seems like they have no
idea what to do with us. We
[had] all these questions
about credits [and] tuition,
and they didn’t have
answers for us when we were
looking for them."

he snd. “We [hudl all those questions about credits [and]
ruirion, and... rhey didn’t have any answers ror us when
we were looking for rhcm."

“It was like once they gor us our ot rherc, every.
thing was hue," and Gossarr,

Liability was a concern for rhc college, said Associate
Dean of rho Collage Helen scorr. “We don'r second guess
the sure departmenr." she said. ”We rate rhar very sorie
ously."

Gossorr and McCollum. who were on n Council on
