Grinnell Loses Heartbreaker, 63-62

A flurry of last minute has
kets with the game winning toss
coming in the last 15 seconds
by Olmstead of Cornell gave the
Rams the one point victory as.

62. It was a heart breaking loss
for the Pioneers, who lead 33a
29 at the half.

The game was a seevsaw bat-
tle all the Way with neither
team holding more than a ﬁve-
point lead at any time.

Dunlap, laid up in bed until

Thursday with an infected leg:

injury, climbed out in time to

score 21 points, eleven of which

were free throws. Toomey col—

lected 12, Bob Dibble 9,

Dave Stumbaugh 7. Elgelow,

supposedly sidelined for

season, donned a uniform in

time to score five points. Frey-

der also poeketed five markers.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

“For a while they had‘fme swamped!”

Seems like this confused fowl got mixed in a metaphor

 

and was almost turned into a guinea pig. The story goes she

got caught in a welter of quick-trick cigarette tests . . . one
puff of this brand, then a pull of that . . . a shill, a whiff — a fast
inhale and exhale. And then she was supposed to know all about

cigarette mildnoss! Is that the way to treat a lady?
And is that the way to judge a oignrelte?
We think Doll That’s why we suggest:

The sensible test — The 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,

which simply asks you to Lry Camels £15 your steady smoke —

on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap
judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels _ and
only Camels _ for 30 days in your “T-Zone" (T for
Throat, T for Taste) We believe you’ll know why . . .

More People Smoke Camels

than any other cigarette!
