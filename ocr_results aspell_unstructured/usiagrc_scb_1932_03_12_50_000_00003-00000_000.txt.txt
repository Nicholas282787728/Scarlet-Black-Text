Darling Scores
Lack of lnterest

(Continued from page 1)
fliesel engines wcre fast being ruined
by mistreatment and ignorant man—
ngcment.

"The people of Russia do not know
what their government is doing."
Mix Darling said. “It sprang into bar
iiig because Germany saw Communist
government as a way to get a little
help. Germany therefore locked Len—
in. Trotsky. and other agitators into
a train and sent them to Leningrad
to talk to the mob; in nine days these
former exiles had brought about the
overthrow of democracy. Today four
per cent of the people run the gov—
ernment. The leaders are sincere
men who manage the government as
Boy Scouts would."

Not People’s Government

“After Leninisin failed and the
New Economic Policy failed. the Ruse
sians threw. everything away but
work. It is not a government by the
people because they will not think
about their government."

This fact was revealed to Mr. Dam
ling’ during his trip to Russia. by a
government leader who had been im-
prisoned in the twenty—seven coun—
tries in which he had lived for oppos-
ing the government or those nations.
“‘Now.” he told Mr. Darling, “if
‘I could choose the government under
which I should like to live. I‘ would
choose the American."

It is characteristic of the American
people to revilc and curse their presi—
dents while they are in office. and
llionize them after they have retired,
Mr. Darling explained. Lincoln.
Roosevelt. Tait. Wilson. Coolidge, all
lwere cursed while in office. "A1-
ithough 1 am a Republican partisan."
said Mr. Darling. "I admit that Woods
row Wilson was crucified by the Re-
publican party for ideas created in
vthat party."

Partisan Voters

“President Hoover is the best
friend of sincere triie government I
have seer. in the White House. He
Wants to carry through reforms
which radical politicians wanted. He
is the most honest and best informed
man 1 ever knew,” Mr. Darling
stated.

Harrison Spengler, state committee
chairman, said in a speech given pre»
ceding" Mr. Darling’s talk. that in
order to make their inﬂuence felt.
the individuals who have the privi—
lege of voting. should he partisan.
The members of thc Gi-innell Republi-
can cluh were doing something which
is their duty, for those who have th».
privilege to take part in government
must do.

Preceding the meeting held in the
ATE. H. auditorium. the Grinnell Re-
publican club entertained Mr. Dar—
ling, Miss Martha McClure. state
