Colflesh, Libby

Agree on Arms

(Continued from page 1)

total of men ready for call of any
nation except Germanyewhich ale
tho totally disarmed under the
Versailles treaty has within 37.000
as many active soldiers as the
United States.

Colflesh firmly advocated the ideal
of the American Legion in desiring
peace. ”The organization,” he said,
“is unalterably opposed to war e).-
cept when unavoidable in defense of
liberties and vital principles of the
nation when all other means of ad-
justment have failed.

Desire Insufficient

"The mere desire to abolish war
will not alone suffice. If lack of arm. —
ments and preparedness constitutes
national security, then China would
have been the most secure nation on
earth rather than the prey to Jap-
anese imperialism."

The National Defense Act of 1920
would provide adequate military es-
tablishment for national defense, ac~
cording to the Legion head and the
Universal Draft law would provide
an effective deterrent to war in elim-
inating profit.

Need Sane Progrnm

He contended that under such a
program, continued international dis-
armament conferences and treaties
might eventually lead to sane uni-
versal armament reduction.

“virtually every nation today de-
pends upon its defenses for national
security,” he concluded, "and so long
as this remains true and so long as
the present economic and political
ehaos over the world exist, then so
long America will have need of a
sane program of preparedness to in-
sure national security."
