On a plot of iowa farmland near the
Minnaota border. 89 turbines rise up into
the prairie sky. The masive fans, part of a
wind farm run by Alliant Energy, have a
combined capacity of so megawatts e
enough to power about 30,000 homes, “It’s
really something to see," said Alliant Prods
uct Manager Richard Nagel.

Members of a Grinnell College activist
group hope the college will soon begin buy.
ing energy ﬁorn wind power or other re-
newablesuurm. SGA Joint Board approved
a resolution last week, sponsored by Free
The Planet, urging the administration to
consider buying renewable energy as soon
as die option becomes available.The reso.
lution passed with one vote against and two
abstentions.

Alliant Energy does not currently have
a program through which hulk consumersi
like Grinnell College, can buy renewable
energy. The Setond Nature program allows
residential customers, in exchange (or
slightly higher electric bills, to speciry that
25, so or 100 percent ortheir poweroome
from renewable sourcﬁ nrher than the coal
piano that currently provide most oriowa's
energy.

“I’m very eager for Alliant to have a
second Nature program available for mstir
tutions and commercial customers," Nagel
said. He added that colleges across the noun.
try have begun expressing interest in renew»
able energy, and thatAlliant “would bevery
interested in talking with an institution like
Grinnell to see what the institution is look-
ing for.“

When Joint Board debated the resolu-
tion, most senators biggest concetnwas the
potential cost of switching to renewable
energy. “if we put this forward to the ode
ministration, we are sending the message
that We are rash, we don't think things
through,” argued Norris senator Kenny
Yeung ’04. “Money has to come from some
where. Are we willing to cut services we have
now? Will they cut ﬁnancial aid? “Will they
cut the health oentcr?"

FTP member Kyle Marquardt ’05 said,
"We don't want to make Grinnell raise tu-
ition or anything like that. We know there
might be tndeoffs, [but] we want to see
what those tradeoffs will be."

College Pmidenl Russell Osgood ex-
pressed an interest in the possibility ofbuy-
ing renewable energy. “Unless it's astro.
nomically expensive," he said, “we would
obviously be interested in doing it,"

The college's electric bills last yar to-
talrad $642,509. according to RickWhitney,
Associate Director of Facilities Manage-
mcnt.

The average residential consumer. with
a monthly bill ofabout $50, would see an
increase of$3.25 per month for 25 percent
renewable energy. $6.50 per month for so
percent, and $13 per month for 100 per.
cent.

The FTP resolution does not ask for a
speciﬁc proportion of the college's energy
to come from renewable sources.

It is still unclear what kind or pricing
system Alliantwould end up using to. lzrgc»
sale consumers, so it is impossible to pk»
diet at the moment how expensive switch»
ing to renewable energy would be.

Budget, cont, from p. 1
college would face severe budget cuts. “1 don't anticipate
any of them going backwards," he said. “The quotion is
how much they're going to grow"

The academic budget was unusually high last year be-
cause or the number of professors on leave, Osgood said.
When faculty members are on sabbatical, they eontinue to
draw a paycheck but a replacement must also be hired.

other problem arms in lastyear's budget included utility
costs, health insurance for college employees, and dining
services. According to Clay, last year's cold winter, eoupled
with nationwide increases in fuel costs, caused a $527,000
spike in the college’s heating bills,

The college also changed its beneﬁts package, making
it easier for employees to cover their families under their
halth insurance plans. That change caused a $316,208
increase in subsidized premiums.

Administrators were most surprised by the $196,000
overrun in the dining services budget, although an increase
in revenues brought the net loss down to $145,000.
Jonathan Brand, Vrce-l’rcsident oflnsritutional and Bud.
get Planning, attributed the overrun in part to “the trznsi»
tioii from a long, long-time dining services director“ —
Dave McConnell,who had overseen
the department since the couege ﬁrst
stopped contracting food services in
the 197057to Dick Williams, who
took over in 1999.

Osgood and Brand said it's of.
ten diihcult to pinpoint the cause
oroverspending in any department.
“we do not have a huge accountant
stair that’s hanging over every bud-
get centct," Osgood said. “Some.
times overruns oocur, and there's not
_much you can do about them,"

Who’s in charge?

The new steering committee is
signiﬁcantly larger than in predom-
sor, the Campus Budget Advisory
Committee, whieh consisted of
Osgood, Clay, two appointed faculty
members. and Dean of the College lim Swan-e. The idea,
according to Osgood, was to bring the budgeting process
out into the open.

Osgood said the committee consists of“evetyone who
has a very signiﬁcant budget responsibility," including
Brand, Claonistant'l'reasutcr Keren Voss, and the heads
of most major administrative departmenn, for a total or
12 individuals.

The faculty members on the committee, who used to
be chosen by the president, are selected democratimlly. Bob
Grey, Poliliml Science, serves on the committee because
he is Faculty Chair, Jack Mutti, Economics, was chosen by
the Faculty Executive council, a group consisting of six
professors and Swartz.

Although faculty repmmmtionsecms to have incrmsod
on the surrace, rhere are still only two fullttime professors
on the committee. Swarm and Associate Deans Helen Scott
and Paula Smith teehnimlly count as faculty members even
though they now work in exclusively administrative jobs.

Osgood says he welcomes input from professors. but
has received only “modest" feedback so far.

one faculty member, who asked to remain anonymous,
commended Brand and other committee members For their
openness to suggestions, but said that the structure orthe
committee itself is does not give the faculty at strong voioe.

The professotdescribed the committee at “an astound-
ing array of administrators with very little direct faculty
participation,“ and also expretsed concern that important
ates surh as the llbnry are not directly represented. The
professor said, “I don’t drink we’ve been listened to very
well in terms orthe way the process has been set up."

Student input

While SGA President Paul Ford ’02 agrees with some
of the committee’s priorities. he feels that many student
concerns aren’t being heard.

“1 don't think nnyone on this campus would argue with
keeping needebiind ﬁnancial aid as a priority," Ford said.
“It's fundamental to the character of the school and to
maintaining the diversity of the community,"

On the other hand, Ford believe: that administrators
are not giving due consideration to issues that arrest the
quality orstudent life at Grinnell. In particular, he cited
dining services and the health center as areas that need
more attention.

“Dining services either needs to be overhauled in terms

orio ﬁnaneial management or it needs more money," he
said. “There needs to he a better, more detailed look at
what’s going on with budgetary matters inside dining ser-
vices.

Funding for student services “is an issue that would
come to the forefront more ifwe were more involved in
budget discussions," Ford said. “I think dirt is the greatest
sore point between the administration and the student body
nght now."

studenu expressed concern about rising tuition costs,
Even with a generous ﬁnancial aid program, they worried.
hlgi tuition might taitse poorer students to dtho Grinnell
from the start, “Many of the brightest potential applicann
for Grinnell aresrared away just byaglance at our $1 13200
price tag," said Enid Quelihorst '05.

Construction projects on campus are another area of
concern, win. some students wondering irtnastees are pri-
oritizing new buildings at the expense orstudent needs.

Ford thinks the trustees) reluctance to include students
in the budgetary decisionemzking process stems from a
belief that students are only concerned with short-term
gains rather than the runrre orthe college _ but “students
do look at many years from now,” he argued.

“irstudents were more involved
in the budget process, there would
be a greater balance hetween look»
ing at 200 years from now and look-
ing at the here and now,” Ford said.
“At times, the trustees could think a
little more heavily about the here and
now

Disappointed by the lack orstu.
dent representation on the commit.
tee, Ford said he would continue lob-
bying for a larger role. Although the
committee holds open forums and
meets with the SGA cabinet after
each of its sessions, he said, “we're
being approached after the her."

Osgood responds

In roponse to student concerns
about tuition, Osgood said that the
college tries to keep in tuition at approximately 90 percent
orthe amount that peer institutions charge,

“Everything I’ve heard from students is, ‘add more rac—
ulty,"’ he toldn small gathering ata public forum last week.
“You can‘t have [faculty numbers and ﬁnancial ard] be high-
est and tuitron lowest."

Many snidents, keenly aware orthe colleges or billion
endowment, wonder why such a wealthy school needs to
cut corners. Osgood responded that the trustees are very
reluctant to rely too much on endowment inoome because
of the unpredietable nature ofthe stock market.“lryout
endowment [dependence] gets above some level, you he
come vulnemble to market contractions," he said.

Contrary to widelyeheld belief, the college’s income
from the endowment does not come from stock dividends.
Instead, the trustees take the average total amount of the
endowment over the last three years and allooite 4.5 per»
cent orthat as revenue. “1t evens out what an be a volatile
market," Brand explained.

Since the trustees don't want to be too dependent even
on that income, a portion or the 4.5 percent is diverted to
a Capital Reserve Fund instead of being used for general
expenses. The capital Reserve Fund, which is slated to re;
eeive312.85 million in endowment funds this year. is used
(or building prajecrs. The trustees are reluctant to dip into
it for any other purpose.

Irtheeollege ever experienceda major ﬁnancial crundi,
Osgood said, “the first thing [ilﬂy would look for is for us
to exert some budget discipline on the expenditure side...
The trustees do not feel the Capinl Reserve Fund should
be used in the base budget."

Osgood said that no one, including himself, could af-
fect the trustees’ decision about how much money from
the endowment to spend.

Osgood and Clay both emphnized that, although they
run budget projections all the time, nothing will be final»
izcd until next semester. Peak times for charitable dona-
tions are the end orthe ﬁscal year in June and the end of
the calendar year, and Clay said that until the numbers for
December arc in, itwill be impossible to tell Whether doe
nations will be signiﬁcantly diirerent from last year Finane
cial aid projections are also in n constant state omits.

The budget ultimately takes the form ora recommcne
dation from the president to the board of trustees, which
makes its ﬁnal decision in February.

If you were in charge of the
budgeting process, what would
your biggest priorities be?

"I like the idea of keeping ﬁnancial aid as
beefy as possible, but beyond that I don’t
have a speciﬁc 2x to grind. However, I
would hope that the budgeting process
were as much about being wise and frugal
as spending money I'dun’t like hearing
how Dining Services squanders its money,
not do I appreciate the massive money
sink the Master Plan seems to be creating
I would like to see the money dealt with in
such a manner that the annual rise in
tuition is brought back into line, and.
ideally, reversed a little. A lot of very
smart, but rather poor people are going to
not be able to come here if tuition keeps
rising, and that is a travesty. Diversity,
intellectual and demographical, will come
from keeping this place affordable to al .”

”I am in full agreement with the decision
of the committee Maintaining the high
hculty salaries and ﬁnancial aid needs of
the students is essential to the diversity
and high academic Standards of Grinnell."
—Ll'52-Man'e Monroe ’03

”Meeting student! full demonstrated need
should be given high priority, but the need
for augmenting the already high faculty
salaries is questionable The adm strators
are guilty of forgetting that their ﬁobs],
as well as the jobs of our professors, are
dependent on students and not vice versa
A 26/7 health center or shifting to
renewable sources of energy might be a
worthier pursuit.”

"Our top three priorities should be
continuing the full ﬁnancial aid program,
maintaining high salaries, [and] reducing
tuitiont Our ﬁnancial aid can never be
well-enough publicized — many of the
brightest potential applicants for Gn'nnell
are scared away just by a glance at our
$113,200 price tag."

’"ihe budget is an incredibly complex task
that takes many people months to put
together. It is often a balancing act with
multiple departments competing for
limited funding with full faith that they
are the most deserving From my limited
knowledge, I think that our decision-
makels do a very good job of making
attendance possible for students who
could not otherwise afford Grinnell, From
my perspective that is a very high
priority"

"As an institution committed to social
justice, we should make sure we treat our
staff justly. As a leading institution, we
need to make sure that we have adequate
library holdings. And, as an institution
that sets itself apart from its peers with a
strong student scholarship program, we
should support that program well." ,
