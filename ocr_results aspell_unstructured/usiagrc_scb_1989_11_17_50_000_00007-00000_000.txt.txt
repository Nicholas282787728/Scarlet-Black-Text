:Allow Foreign Students Off—Campus Aid

 

To the Editor:

‘ The administration’s proposal to
prohibit international students from
applying their financial aid to the
cost of off~campus programs is both
discriminatory and illogical.

First, Grinnell does not gain or
lose any more money by allowing an
international student to leave came
pus titan it does by allowing an
American student to leave. If an
American student is on 75 percent
financial aid, he or she is given that
same percentage of aid when deter-
mining the cost of off~campus stud-
ies. To do otherwise for intema-
tional students is blatantdiscrimina»
tion on thepart ofGrinnell's admin-
istrative body.

Second, I think somewhere along
the way to academic excellence,
Grinnell has lost sight of its primary
function of preparing students both
socially and academically for the
future. Restricting an individual’s
right to perform off campus study
hinders his or her access to a well
rounded education. This restriction
does nothing but devalue policies at
Grinnell which have made the cam-
pus diverse by attracting the current
student body. As a current partici-

pant in an off-campus study pro»
gram, 1 cannot overstate the impor»
lance of allowing students to expand
their education by participating in
off-campus study. ,

Finally, throughout the past year
and a halfatGrinnell, I have become
increasingly alarmed by President
Drake’s need to compareGrinnell to
other colleges which he feels arc of
the same or higher caliber. This,
unfortunately, has happened in rc~
gard to educational standards, tui-
tion costs and now off~campus stud-
ies. The administration invokes the

arguments of other schools which
prohibit their international students
from leaving campus, but one can
also invoke the arguments of LIIOSP
schools who do allow their intema-
tional students to leave.

It boils down to whether Grinnell
wishes to be a leader or a follower in
the future of academic study. By
setting its own policy standards in-
stead of following others‘, Grinncll
could once again increase its status
as an excellent liberal ans college,
rather than continue its decline.

I Saw the Burglar

— the Other One

 

To the Editor:

I strongly disagree with the State»
mentinlastweek‘sScarletandBlack
(“Burglar Strikm 6 Dorms," Nov.
10) that only one of the campus
prowlers was seen clearly.

Like Henry Wheaton, I very dis-
tinctly saw the man who walked into
my room, but it was not the same
intruder Henry saw. This burglar
was also about five-foot-eight and
around 18 yearsof age, but had fairly

long,wavy,medium-brown hairand
rather delicate features.

As with the other incidents re-
poned, he walked in, turned on the
lights and asked where a certain
student in Iames Hall was.

I thought that since the student
body has been informed of the ap-
pearanceofoneintruder,they should
know what the other looked like as
well.

Enough 1—Sided Analyses of Israeli News

 

To the Editor:

Afterreading “International Date-
lines" (Nov. 3), [am leftabitpuzzled
and disturbed by the column‘s su-
perﬁcial coverageof complex events.

One of the aniclcs I am troubled
by penains to Israel. In this article.
Israeli troopsconfiscated Arab prop-
erty wonh $1.5 million from people
living in the West Bank town of Beit
Sahur. The reason for conﬁscation
alluded to was the refusal to pay
owed taxes. The article continues
and states the Arabs' reason for not
paying. They feel they have no rep
resentation and this seemingly gives
them the right to reque paying.

What about Israel’s side'.7 ObviA
ously this is an one-sidedanalysis. It
leaves the reader to make judgments
with only one side of the story.

In an attempt to provide clarity

and baiance,1 would like to offer an
explanation. In 1967. Israel took
control of the administered ten-ito-
ries from its aggressive enemies,
Jordan and Egypt. It also took con-
trol of, and later annexed the Golan
Heights and Jerusalem. Most of the
Arabs in these annexed areas were
offered and accepted full Israeli citi—
zenship. In the administered ten-ito-
ries, which Israel holds for security
reasons, the residents have rejected
any notion of Israeli citizenship.
Should they pay taxes? For 22
years, the Arabs in these territories
have willingly cooperated with Is-
raeli tax regulations. In return. Israel
has provided thme residents with
new roads, hospitals,watcr systems.
schools,etc.For instance, no univer-
sities in these areas existed before
1967. Today there are five. Israel

established 20 post-high-school in-
stitutions attended by 17,000 young
Arabs. Their water supply had in-
creased from 140 cubic meters in
1967 to 700 cubic meters in 1977.
Before 1967, the infant mortality
rate in these areas was 120 per 1000
and only 10 percent of babies were
born in hospitals. Last year, only 30
per 1000 infants died and 80 percent
of babies were born in hospitals.

The real question is,should people
pay taxes that they owe for services
already rendered? The answer must
be yes! People must pay for what
they get. In the U.S., as in most
democratic nations, the government
also takesproperty and throwsp'cople
in prison for Lax evasion.

Most important, is this relevant

To Ille Editor:
I received the following unsigned
note, to which I wish to respond:
“We found this porcelain religious
piece rather offensive. It is loud,
gaudy and rather obnoxious. It takes
{away from the beauty and serenity
ofI-Ien‘ick Chapel as a whole, and it
draws too much attention to itself.
“We have removed it from the
wall of the chapel for these reasons.
We think it‘s more appropriate as
bathroom art. I hope we aren’t of»
fending anyone by doing this. We
aren‘tdoing itforthesakcot” causing
trouble. Wejust really don’t like it."
I am grateful that, when moving

this religious piece from the sanctu-
ary to the basement bathroom, you
did notdamage this rather expensive
work of an.

By the way, someone decided to
damage the pulpit in the chapel at
about the same time. I hope there is
no connection between these two
actions.

I strongly encourage the writers of
the above note to meet with me to
discuss their concern, certainly a
more mature and positive way to
approach this issue. I shall await
your reply.
