Squad Leaves
For Ripon Game

Pioneers Set
To Bid For
Midwes’r Title

By Phil Osborn.

Twenty—seven members of
the Pioneer football squad
left this morning for Beaver
Dam, Wis, where they will
stay all night before going on to
Ripon to meet the Redmen to-
morrow afternoon.

A victory will give the Pioneers
a chance for the Midwest con-
ference football title, but either
a tie or a loss will give the title
to Ripon.

Redmen Win.

Last weekend the Redmen beat
Lawrence's Vikings 13 to 7; the
Vikings handed the Pioneers their
only conference defeat of the
year in the season’s opener.

In Saturday's game Lawrence
outplayed Ripon; in the Law—
rence-Grinnell game, the Pioneers
outplayed the Vikings. On this
basis, rather than on the basis
of comparative scores, the Pio-
neers look to be the better team.
Weather Slows Squad.

Because of the cold and wet
weather this week, Grinnell prac—
tices have been short. Contact
work has been avoided this week
because of fear of injuries. Most
of the time has been spent in
brushing up on a defense for
Ripon plays.

Harold Jekel, sophomore block-
er, did not make die trip; he is
bothered by an early season leg
injury which cropped up again in

the Cornell game.

Other players who may he
benched part time by injuries are
Ed Nagel, fullback; Kay Mathews
and Jack Bredimus, guards; and
Jerry Grant, tackle. They were
all injured in the Beloit game last
weekend.

Lineup Unoertain.

Because of the uncertainty of
the fitness of these men, Coach
Ben Douglas is not sure of his
starting lineup. The most physi-
cally fit combination possible will
be started against the Vikings.

Pioneer spirit has been high
throughout the week, and for the
first time in 14 years a Grinnell
football team will be making its
bid for a conference championship

Honor '6' Plans

New Committees

The Honor ”G" club will appoint
a program committee to serve for
the rest of the year at its next
meeting, according to Gerald
Grant, president of the group.

The lettelmen will also elect
an initiation committee at that
time, Grant said. No date for the
meeting has been called, Grant
stated, but it will be held soon.

“From now on,” he said, “we
will devote more of our time to
intemal club affairs, in an at—
tempt to make the club more to
the men than it has been in the
past."

Truesdale Lands
Sports Program
of Town Men

The Town men are rapidly jus-
tifying their recognition asa sep-
arate intramural unit, was the
opinion of John c. Truesdale, di-
rector of the men’s intramural
program, when questioned today
concerning that innovation.

After winning the intramural
golf trophy, the town men began
the touch-football season with fine
organization and spirit, Trues-
dale said.

The competitive spirit and good
“turn outs" that they had through-
out tlie touch-football season exemr
plifies their intent to make good
the recognition given them by
the intramural board, he added.

Barnes Collects
$l,l50 Damages

Awarded $1,150 in damages for
an auto accident, John “Bink”
Barnes has joined the ranks of
“bloated capitalists."

Barnes left Grinnell last Sunday
for St. Louis where he spent
Monday and Tuesday as plaintiff
in a case planned to sue the dri-
ver of a car which stinok and
injured him.

After the Iawesuit had been
completely arranged, it was de-
cided to settle the suit out of
court and both the defendant and
plaintiff agreed that 51,150 was
reasonable compensation.
