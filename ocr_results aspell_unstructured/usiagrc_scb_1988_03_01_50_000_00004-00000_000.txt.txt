Why are you the best can-
didate for president?

Pleshette Hamh

I think I’m the best candidate for
president for many reasons. 1 think
that the SGA President should be a
representative of the student body.
I think that the SGA President
should be able to voice the student
body's issues and concerns that
they have, as well as work with the
administration, faculty: trustees
and alumni, to obtain what's
necessary for die student body and
student life. I also think that the
SGA President should be able to be
outspoken but calm, be able to
know when they're not being imr
partial enough on decisions and
know to step back and say ‘maybe
I shouldn’t be the one making the
final decision on this because this
is too close to me.' I think that they
should be able to mediate the com-
mittee so that the Committees and
everything involved in SGA, and in
student life is wellerepresentative
of the student body at large, not
that certain people are picking
their friends or that it's secluded to
certain names because they've
always been in SGA and that
automatically makes them the
best candidate. As president. I
think that that will be my first
goal. to make sure that SGA is a
representation of the student body,
because it's a student government
association for the students, not for
particular people or for personal
reasons.

Paul Froese

i believe l'm the people's cane
didate. l believe that there's a ma
jority of this Campus that doesn’t
know a thing about SGA. 1 am a
candidate that doesn't know a
thing about SGA. And I think that
those people should be able to voice
their peeves through me.

Greg Evans

l‘m the best candidate because
I've had the most direct SGA exV
perience with the office of
presidency. i think some people
don't know exactly what they're
getting into and I think the office of
parliamentarian has allowed mc to
see what the office of president
does, helped me to advise the
president and then. also to let me
see what everybody else does. So.
as president I can tie those groups
together.

Dianna Ward

The reason I'm the best can-
didate is basically, I‘ve done a lot
and I've had leadership positions,
but not in the traditional sense,
I've done a lot but I have not had
any titles, and I would continue to
do a lot without those titles, on this
campus, especially, l'd like to go
into depth about the library and the
grant The black library, when we
got it. we sort of neglected it. and l
won't even guess how few books we
have on women's titles, but I went
through the library, and l was
specifically looking for topics on
women, all types of women. that
goes for gay women. so on and so
forth, I didn't find but maybe 20. 25
different names, On black women,
that's about it, as far as black les-
bians, black poets. There were
about 20 names and they wrote dilr
ferent books. And you couldn't
really find some of the better books
that they had written. People
would tell you to find suchrand-
such a book, and you couldn't find
it. Diane Pinderhughes, the Con
vocation speaker, came in and

Presidential Interviews

said, "Let me see your black
library," so I took her to see it and
she was really disappointed. For
her to come and say that, i wonder
what some of the other black pro
{essors that would come and look
at this school — I'm only talking in
the humanities department, not
saying that all black professors are
humanities professors. because I
think that's a general idea on this
campus I went to Chris McKee
and I asked him how much we had
to spend. At the time he told us he
had $50,000 to spend on library
books, period, from some fund in
the library for books that were
dated before 1985. I believe.
Caroline Gebhard. Barbara Nowak
— Mary Lynn Broe already gave
me her list. Maria Moorty is still
working on hers 7 and Kesho
Scott, they're working on lists of
black women and third-world
women for the library. 1 found out
that die librarian is committed to
spend $5000 on those certain topics,
We can start there with certain
things, the little things that could
lead up to a lot. As far as the black
professors, we need to think of un-
traditional ideas of getting black
professors here. because we've
tried everything. We've yelled at
the trustees. We've yelled at the
administration and faculty.
They‘re telling us the same things.
We can come up with ideas when
we go to to yell as them, of certain
small things that might lead up to
big things, Like the library. When
they come here and they look at the
library 7 let‘s say for the
humanities professors 7 Kesho
and Ms, Mootry. whenever they
want to go do research, and Pita to
some extent, they have to go to
Iowa City, And that's true of a lot
of professors. but we do have
money to spend for that and that's
no reason to neglect it, just
because all the professors, or
anybody, has to do that i think
people need to pay more attention
to these little things. We have
money on this campus that no one
ever utilizes 7 passive funds, and
so forth, I also have been in contact
with a couple of trustees. our black
trustees. trying to get more money
for the black students to use for
newsletters and so forth, to keep in
touch with other schools. One of the
black trustees 7 not mentioning
any names 7 said he‘d give us a
couple thousand dollars to use. And
that includes maybe if we want to
go down to Spelman, see how the
black students on an allrblack cam»
pus live. the problems they have,
talking with black professors
there, seeing if they might be in-
terested in the exchange program
that is not in act right now, These
are minor things. but they could be
lead up to be big things, and l have
done these without any leadershlp
roles. My favorite is the grant. l'm
working on a grant for the Afroe
Americanstudies program, l've
already called several Wealthy
black individuals that don‘t have
any contact with this but are
friends with some of the trustees,
and l have been asking them
whether or not they want to endow
a chair. if maybe they have friends
that want to get together and en»
dew and AirmAmericanrstudies
chair. For them, that would be an
honor because they are not usually
asked to do things like this for
predominantly white institutions. I
think that right there 7 thcy could
not touch the Afro-American
studies classes like they do the
\vomen'shlstory courses 7 when
they're having financial problems,
then we'll just wipe il out It would

not be considered a tad course. It
would be endowed. They couldn't
touch it. They could bring in really
toprnotch visiting professors. What
me and Ms, Richard were talking
about was maybe bringing in a
Gwendolyn Brooks or someone.
Maybe not someone that expen-
sive. But someone with a name.
That right there * in the
humanities department, let me
stress that, because I would not
have an answer to the problems in
the math or the science depart-
ment. because I‘ve been concen»
trating on this area 7 bringing in
people like that, big names, you'd
also have other black protessors
wanting to publish with these pens
ple.

That would be quite an honor, to
spend the semester publishing with
Gwendolyn Brooks or Maya
Angelou or someone. It's not im
possible. There are foundations
that we haven't yet looked into
People don't understand that the
money we have at this school, you
cannot just touch/whenever you
want It. It's in mutual funds, low»
risk funds, real estate. You can't
just take the money out and spend
it because the students want more
professors. I want more professors
and i think the 3-2 program could
be a really good thing because it
gives professors more time to
publish, At the same time, I think
we need to think of other ways to
get more professors in here, getr
ting more chairs endowed. That
experience with these different
ideas l've been talking to you about
could be spread over all
know how to gel mfoney, and right
if ow we could raise that money
[with a phonathoniand think about
what we could do next year as far
as foundations, and start looking
into those types of ideas, and, like i
said, work towards the future and
getting more chairs endowed,
those that are considered [ad
courses,

iii-ad Sheridan

First of all because I believe l
have more experience with the
students. l'm the only candidate
who's been an HAC A few of them
have been SAs. l'm the only tour
guide. l've had a lot to do with the
school using my interpersonal
skills. I think that‘s what‘s really
important, 1 think that's what
pushes me over the other can-
didates.

Diive Steinmiul

Because of my experience. I
know that one of the other
prestigious candidates has almost
as much experience. but he doesn't
have experience in the area of
finance. it is 95 percent of SGA.
whether people want to believe it
or nol. I've been involved for three
years In seeing how you go about to
get things done in SGA. Almost all
of it is through the finance depar‘ir
ment of the government, A lot
more could be done if the president
knows how these finances work
and be able to use these funds in
dilfcrellt Ways. I think, with the
restructuring we’re going to do il's
imperative to have a candidate
that understands when we've been
trying to do with this restructuring
with the concerts and films and the
whole Georgia Dentel issue. When
we got that settled, we're really go
ing to need someone who realizes
why we're doing this and cash
carry out what we've set up,

How will you do this job dif»
ferently than Liz Johnson
has?

I’Ieshette Ilamh

i plan to have the students more
involved in the decision»making
process of SGA. I will try to have
the cabinet members and the cams
mittee members more accountable
for what they're assigned to do.
What I Could see wasn't totally
done well this year was, with cams
pus issues and student issues.
students were the last to know
about them. I want the student
chairperscns and cabinet
members held accountable for
what they have to do, We don't
want to wait until the day before or
two days before an event is going
to happen to have itout there, with
the cabinet 7 I know a lot are
friends of Liz's, and l'm not saying
that's good or had. I'd want to have
more ofa diverse group of student-
body members there so that not be»
ing impartial or friendship con»
flicts never come up because that's
no way to handle things.

pinl Froese
I'm an honest candidate and l'm
going to be completely honest with
you. l have no idea what Liz
Johnson is doing right now,

Greg Evans

l've got some strengths l think
that will come out if elected presi-
dent One; I think I can run a
meeling efficiently. with a direc~
tion and a purpose in mind. and
very decisively. That's a big dif-
ference, running meetings. Next, I
Will monitor committees and
cabinet positions so we make sure
we ha i'e close communication bet-
ween the president and every
branch of SGA, Further. I will go
out (0 the people, like the study
breaks lve been holding with my
campaign and talk to people
directly, get them to know that
they have someone leading SGA in
a purposeful direction and spen»
ding their money correctly 1 think
those three things are things that
can be improved upon next year.

Dianna “turd

Due to the fact that l see that
SGA has more negative things than
positive right now. I wouldn't put
that off on Liz Johnson. because
that was a lasting type of thing I
saw it mo:'e my freshman year
when Liz was not president. I saw
student apathy way up. What l
would do is work very hard to get
more ill\»ilvement from the
students l'ni not going to say that
Liz Johnson hasn‘t exactly done
that. but I’d like to see more of it
done. That‘s going to bc a big thing
of mine 7 getting more people in-
vovled in son, so that they'll feel
they are represented. The commit
tops that in have would not be
made up of every friend of mine.
Like l said, l'm not saying that Liz
or anybody else does that. l'm just
saying it's prevalent in most
political organizations. There are a
lot of people that i think are
qualified that are not involved at
all because they aren'l asked to.

until shci-illiin

lwoultlu't put us much emphasis
on outside interests 7 the com-
munity and national stuff. I know
she's much more up on the issues
and she does bring them into the
campus. But [don't know as much
about them and I don't deem them
as important as what goes on on

this campus. l know for a fact that
i would plan a lot more events that
would imclve the entire campus. I
would deal with all the groups on a
general level and assess the needs
of the smaller groups, At the Joint
Board meetings, I would bring up
what I was going to do. What I saw
was a lot of false promises. Not
false promises, but the ice-skating
rink. for example and a lot of

'things that fell through that we

thought were right there, that we
were going to have it soon. I would
be sure to let people know what's
realistic, from the beginning. “We
don't have much of a chance [or
this. but I'm working towards it,” I
don't think i would lead people
around ln a circle, I don't think she
know. either. what was going to
happen, but that was what students
thought and i thought.

“are Steinman

1 would n meetings a lot
tighter. I think that the meetings
themselves are the least important
of the president's jobs. us just
kind of a running forum, The
senators are interested in it for the
first forty-live minutes and then
they want to get the hell out of
there. so we need to keep these
meetings short and to a minimum.

i would represent a larger pore
tion of this campus. Liz is an "offv
campus" type person and 1 think
she has not represented the whole
campus as well as i would likefto
have seen her do.

How realistic are your
campaign promises'.7

Pleshette lluinb

l don't make campaign proe
mises. Part of my campaign. We
been visiting student group
organizations on campus. i tell
them I'm not there to make proe
mises. and l'm not going to make
promises because you never know
what‘s going to happen. you never
know what situation you're going
to be in, The only thing I say on my
campaign signs and on my state-
ment of intent is that We been
forced to deal with concerns. like
the H program. the lack of diver-
sity of faculty members. and I will
address those issues as SGA presir
dent and see what I can do to
minimize the effect that these have
on the students. But I'm not
building a big platform and saying
"Vote for me because l‘m promise
ring to do that for you." ll l'm
elected SCiA President I'll try to
have certain issues brought up and
you can brillg them up to SGA, to
your senator. and you'll know that
someone knows about them other
than just you and your senator But
1 don‘t make campaign promises
because you get shot down when
you don't keep them after you‘re
elcctcd.

I’Ellll lrroese

As far as I know l haven't made
any promises yet What I'd most
like to do for SGA is cut down the
meetings. Let's face it, people talk
a lot and it could be cut. say one-
sixteenth I believe that if people
were limited to speaking five
words in a row we would have a
concise, quick. and 1 think better
SGA.

Greg Eviiiis
My campaign promises are very
realistic because l'm focusing on
the implementation of ideas. and i
think that because I've had a prov-
ing ground from my two years of
experience. 1 can actively set forth
everything that l'm trying to do.
