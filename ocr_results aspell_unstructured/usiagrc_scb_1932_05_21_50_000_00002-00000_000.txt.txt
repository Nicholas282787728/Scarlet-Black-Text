ANOTHER TRIUMPH

It w s no surprise to us that ”The Merl-limit
of Veni e”. presented by the department of drama
of Grinuell college. under the able direction of
Sara Sherman Pryor, Thursday night, last night.
alid this afternoon. was one of the outstanding
successes of the current school year. We would
have been Surprised if it had not been.

“The Perfect Alibi“, and the rest, all were 01'

Then too—the vast. None of the FI‘IEII’IIL‘IL‘I'S

S. 0. S.
(From st, Louis University News)

with the school year drawing to a close, many
financiallyrhal'l'asscd students are wonde 'ng how they
will as able to secure employment this summer. For
most of ther, failure to get a job this Summer means
the preuulturc end of a college education.

There are always a number of positions open to
young men during the summer, even though this year
the amount is exceedingly limited. The question is, will
these positions go to the deserving students? Many ear-
nest students will find their dreams of a college career
lilasted because the job they sought went to another
student who got the position through the influence of
relatives. and who is pridlng himself that he is working
his way through school “just like Dad", not because
he has to, bilt simply because it is a source of pride to
himself that he does not have to draw on the family
resources. .

These unfortunately ambitious and myopic young
men do not realize that they are inflicting a serious
injury when they seifishly snatch a job from a really
needy student simply ,because they wish to assuage
their pride by working‘thcir way through school, draw-
ing a salary they receive primarily because of nepotism.
because they have a pull.

The large number of selfish rather, uncles. et 'al.,
lvho are able to find a place for sons and nephews, but
really can't. afford to hire anyone else who has his career
depending on a ridiculously small salary that ‘neverthe-
less is enough—with unbelieveabiy drastic ingenuity in
depriving oneself of the necessities of liteito pay col-
lege expenses, should realize that they have a duty to
give somebody else a chance, and that they are doing
a despicahiy small thing when they smugly her all but
the kin from a share in the salaries. -

The jobs most of these offer are underpaid, over»
worked affairs. but to the great number who arc really
desperate they mean, salvation. Alumni who pride them-
selves on their affection and loyalty, but who insist
they can't afford to hire any students during the sum-
mer, but intend to pay a coterie or relatives salaries, are
exemplifying the lesson that not only students are
learning: “You may not be able to put a man otlL when
he's down. but at least you can try '

A FABLE OF THE TERM PAPER
(From the Kentucky Kernel)

“A’nd lo, it came to pass that the time drew near
when all the seekers after knowledge should be tested
on that wisdom and knowledge which they had gained
throughout the year. Then was there weeping and
gnashing of teeth; for though, indeed, it seemeth pass-
ing strange, many lighthearted ones had forsooth put
off the acquisition of that knowledge until the tomorrow
which never comes, and now would they be forced to
acquire it all at once, even as the serpent devoureth
his prey.

Then indeed did many of the seekers after know-
ledge hurn great quantities of midnight oil, and did
spend long hours seated before the typewriter, seeking
to amass much matter for that abomination known as
the term paper. And it came to pass that as they sat
there. overcome by the enormity of the punishment for
their crime of ommission, that they did swear a great
oath that if it so be that the gods permit them to live
through this time of stress, that not another moon should
pass before they would be working on the term papers
that the wise ones should require of them. that never
again should such a hop as this one happen."

Thus ends the fable of the term paper. The moral is
so plain as to he almost offensive. The last lap of the
semester is now upon us. Ample time has been given
to begin the fulfillment of that each which we have
made at the hectic end of so many semesters. Those
who are wise will begin now, if they have not yet
begun, to prepare for that day of reckoning which
comes as surely as the end of the semester. Term papers
prepared now will be as good, even better. than those
prepared “the night before.” if this be a challengeﬁ
make the most of it.
