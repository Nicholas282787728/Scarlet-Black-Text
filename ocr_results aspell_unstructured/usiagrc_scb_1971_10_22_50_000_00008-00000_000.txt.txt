Pioneers Succumb To Beloii

by Bronlosauras

Playing in iroht oi a hostile audience
and bearing with poor oiiiciating, the
crinnell college soccer team suiiered
its second loss oi the season to Beloli
d—l,

(These are not excuses ior the team.
The iirst part yust sounded like agood
introduction, and the second part, while
true, aiiected both teams equally.)
otiiciating oi the type seen in this
game is seldom seen. even inhigti school-
soccer it was inexcusable. Theoiiicials
cost each team one goal.

Grinnell's goal, scored by Steve

l-tirshon, came when the reieree awarded
the Pioneers a penalty kic . The call
occured when a Gl‘lnnell player ran into
Beloil's goalie. However, the reieree
said that the goalie ran into the Pioneer.

Disappointment

Eeloll's iree goal came when one oi
their players knocked Gl'innell‘s goalie
down and layed on him as his teammate
tapped the ball into the goal

The game was a disappointment ior
[he'Gifinhell team who. despite missing
tour starters and the ioiirtli hall-back,

were trying to avenge a 771 loss to
Beloi! last year.

UPCOMING SPORTS

FOOTBALL: Saturday, October 23, the Pioneers will
face Beloit, at Beloit, Wisconsin. Statistics indicate
the Pioneers have an edge over the Beloit team which
has lost their last 27 games and was demolished by
Coe in their last outing, 8770.

SOCCER'

Grinnell’s soccer team will take on Knox

College in Calesburg, Ill., on Saturday. The Pioneers
have an even record of two wins, two losses, and a
tie and are enthusiastic about their chances against

Knox.

Last year the Siwushers edged out Grinnell

1~U and came to a 171 draw in the two games of the
season. Back in September they scored in the final
minute, topping Grinnell, 473.

CROSS COUNTRY: The Spikers will also be headed
towards Wisconsin tomorrow to compete in a multi-
tmm meet, the Beloit Invitational. Although our team
remains undefeated in dual meet competition this
