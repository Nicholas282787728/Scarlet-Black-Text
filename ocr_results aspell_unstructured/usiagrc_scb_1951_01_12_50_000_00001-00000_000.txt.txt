States. Grinnell delegates were}
Ruth Atwater, l-laines junior and‘
“Y” president; Dorsey Laurie.‘
Haines sophomore; Sue Yager.
Main freshman; and Pat Bartell,
iPine Tree junior.

“It was real democracy in ac-'
tion," reported Pat Bartell. “a
tremendous .erperience for all of
us.” She said that the atmos—
phere of enthusiasm and inter»>
est was overwhelming. This is‘
proved by the fact that $3000
was given by delegates for the
purpose of starting Student
Christian Associations in Latin
American countries.

Programs planned for delee‘
gates to the convention included
two series of lectures given by
outstanding church and educa—
tional leaders on the theme,
”What Does God Require of Us?"
Some of the topics were: per—
sonal life, higher education, and
the Christian and politics. Two.
speakers especially interesting
to Grinnell representatives were
Mrs. Vera Micheles Dean, Dir.
ector df the Research Depart
ment, Foreign Policy Associa—
tion, and Alexander Miller of
Union Theological Seminary,
whose topic was “Christian Voe
cation."

Our representatives brought‘
back with them many new ideas

Trustees Plan College Policy

During Vacation 3 group that often works so quietly that we
are hardly aware of its existence, was making plans that Will ul-

timately, directly or indirectly,
college.
The group is the trustees.

They are responsible for the
educational policies of the school.
, They are the immediate “boss"
of the college president who
looks to them for advice and
help. They decide such things
as the size of the college, the
building program, the longerun
stand on discipline. They recent—
ly considered the proposal estab—
lishing an ROTC unit on the
campus.

What Trustees Do

Mr. Joseph Rosenfield of Des
Moines, the president of the
board'of trustees, has clarified
some df their Work for the stu-
dents. He mentioned the inti-
mate concern of the trustees
with the financial work of the
college. He said of Grinnell’s fi-
nance-raising, ”It’s a problem

aitect all of the students of the

the students don't understand. 1
know I couldn’t when 1 was in
college."

He mentioned the routine ac.
tivities of the board at large,
approving the annual budget and
unusual expenditures As awhole
the board meets at commence.
ment and homecoming

The trustees approve all per—
sons recommended for faculty
before contracts are made with
them. Mr. Rosenfield especially
stressed the fact that the Grin-
nell board does not attempt to
suppress or censor in any way
the faculty members hired. “The
academic freedom that is so
much in the news now is a real.
ity at Grinnell," he said.

student-Trustee Meetings

There is nearly no other fac—
ulty—trustee relationship. There

 

has been none officially between
students and trusts, but because
Mr. Rosenfield feels it would be
beneficial to both groups, he
has invited the advisory board
to Des Moinos for a dinner this
month. The member students of
the board include the League
Board president, C of HP pres-
ident, Student Council president,
social cd-ordinator. and S at B
editor.

The trustees are either Grin.
nell graduates or men deeply ins
terested in the college. At one
time Grinnell sought “big
names" on its trustee list, Mr.
Rosenfield said, but he feels
that the college is now fortunate
in having a group of men which
works hard at the job of being
trustees. Most are donors to the
college. Twelve of the 22 mem-
bers are lowans. They serve six
year terms of office with part of
the group retiring in 1951, part
in 1953, and part in 1955.
