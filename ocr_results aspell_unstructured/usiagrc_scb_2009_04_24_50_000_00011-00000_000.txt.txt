Consent can be sexy, start practicmg now

Erin McBurney ‘09 and Emma Lawler ‘09 explain why Disney movies can’t explain sexual relations

Today concludes Take Back the Night
Week, an awareness-raising week-long event
focusing on issues ofsexual assault and safety
This Thursday PAC sponsored a workshop on
consent, led by my lovely co-aurhor this week,
Emma Lawiet '09. We’re here to refute the
immortal words of Ursula, the infamous Sea
Witch from everyone’s . oute childhood
movie The Little Mermaid. Little did you
know, you need to be working against most
of what you learned from Disney movies in
your adult seatral relations. Body language is
important and sery (sometimes, did you go to
Underwear BrrUP), but it isn't enough.

In the Vague mysticism ofsex knowledge, it
sometimes can be hard to know bowand when
you need to ask for and give consent. Con-
, it i be sexy, and it isn't signing a contract,
despite what you may have taken away from

Willingness to learn and grow

1 was disturbed on many levels to read
Noah and Smita's letter in the 5&5. The
symposium, "Transcending Conﬂict: israel
and Palestine," was jointly sponsored by the
Palestinian Solidarity Group, Chalutzim and
Peace Studies, The authors fail to mention
this crucial fact.

Leaders of the Palestinian solidarity
Group received and approved Roumani’s re~
sume before he was asked to speak at Gi'innell.
Moreover. Chalutzim helped fund and orgar
nize all aspects of the Symposium, including
a lecture by Har‘b Hath, a Palcstrman Ameris
can medical student, and Mariam Bazeed,
an Egyptian American from Seeds of Peace.
PSG and Chalutzim eqiially sponsored all asr
pects of the Symposium, including Professor
Rouiniini's visit, and each grotip is equally re
sponsible for his presence on campus.

The jointly organized symposium armed
to “tianscend conflict," to foster constructive
dialogue by bringing varying vrewporrits to
campus. Each presenter spoke and represent
cd themselves, not Chalutzim, PSG or Peace
Studies. We presented different perspectives
because diversity is a core value of Grinnell.
We hoped that these distinct individuals
would allow students to learn and grow. to
grapple with their own notions of truth and
conﬂict resolution.

I spent months working on this sympoe
sium with my fellow organizers from P56. 1
understood that we all approached these eons
troversial issues without cruel intentions and
strove, howcver unrealistically, to bring diverse
scholars and presenters to campus. Last week's
letter offers neither me not Chalutzim any
such courtesy

1n the aftermath of this joint symposium,
the first ofits kind,l was excited to have found
peers who shared my passion for resolving
the Israel and Palestine conflict and thrilled
to have created a program that constructivee
ly interacted with people whom i disagreed
with. Clearly, not everyone agrees with these
sentiments. I look forward to the day when
Grinnellians can move beyond finger pointing
and hurtful attacks, a day when we can rccogr
nizc the value in all points ofview and through

to introducing your kink to a new partner, vor
calizing your desires and understanding their
comfort level can be as fun as the down and
dirty itself. Feeling out someones feelings
about feeling you feels gooditrust us.

There is a grand misconception in many of
our minds that talking about sex and consent
‘i a moodrkillcr, Let’s be iealiyou're not iob-
brng anyone of the mystery ofwhat's going on
between your ears and your legs. Consciously
practicing consent can be a hard thing to start
doing, especially if you aren't used to the idea
or don't even know the words. But it's called
practicing consent for a reason—tire more you
do it, the better yoti get, You have to go brg or
go home, no pun intended,

There are little ways to practice giving and
asking for consent that don‘t involve sea, of
course. The best way to respect each others'

personal bound
is to bcn'ln
pr-aetrti
sent that shows
your attention
to and acknowh
edgerncnt of
other bodies.
instead of playing with somconc’s hair, ask if
you may. Don’t grab someones hand and as-
sunre they'll be okay with it. Instead, tell them
you’d like to hold their hand if they want to.
Practice consent with your friends and strange

mutual respect. explore solutions for peace.

SR! on new Wal-marr initiative

In early June, waleMart shareholders.
including Grinnell College, will have the
chance to vote on a resolution that seeks to
incorporate "gender identity" into Wal-Marr's
statement of Equal Employment Opporttk
niry (EEO).We. the Students for Responsible
Investment, have sent the Trustees of the In-
vestment Committee a lcttcr arguing that the
College should vote “yes" on the initiative not
only because of its clei connection to our
Core Values, but also because of the unconr
vincing nature ofWal—Mart's arguments.

Shareholder resolutions are proposals subs
mitrcd by stockholders that often try to pro—
mote corporate responsibility or change core
poratc governance srnictures, Gr innell College
as an institutional invcstor has the right to vote
on such resolutions. as well as pilrt’ e in other
forms of corporate dialogue. We believe the
College should utilize that right to promote
its mission as an institution.

The "Gender Identity Non-Discrimina-
tion" resolution at WalsMart is a perfect op
portunity to do so. With minimal financial
implications, this resolution has the potential
to create a safer, more supportive work envir
ronrrrent for WalrMart employees as well as
helps attract skilled applicants who may have
chosen not to apply previously because oftheir
own gender identity or because they are “fair
minded Citizens."

Protections based on gender identity
are supported by Grinnell’s Core values. At
the upcoming meeting of the Trustees. the
Grinneil College Nondiscrimination Policy
(ND?) will be amended to include “gender
identity or expression," an amendment of
which we are quite proud. This change is in
line with Ciinnell's Commitment to “it divcrsc
community," which is a core value of the Col-
lege, and particularly supports the college’s
goal of attaining “a wide diversity of people
and perspectives"on campus. Not only is pro-
tection based on gender identity supported in
our core values, but students also demonstrat-
ed their support for this protection through a
Spring 2008 student initiative, for which 78.4

ers alike.

We've already said it, but giving and re
cciving consent is definitely sety In the zinc
“Learning Good Consent," (Google it; it’s
a really awesome compilation or writings on
personal journeys and tips and suggestions and
stories. all about consent) an unnamed author
writes, “rvhat's so hot, so empowering, so fucks
ing amazing about consent is that the yes's tar
ally become yes’s, The first time you hear no, it
validates all the yes's." Really, that's just about
the best way to say it

so, learn to ask. Turn it into a gameiwilh
rules niaybe?~we all know that can be fun
But you have to ask eveiy time. just because
you've touched her chest like so million times
before does no! make them yours. “Can 1 take
your shirt oil?" might seem a little redundant
if your boy is squirming a lrttlc with excites
mcnt but you don't know unt u ask: VVith-
out it, you cannot understand what they want
or what they're thinking.

Consent is fun, and consent is sexy, Cori-
scrrt is about learning how to please your lover
the best you ran through open and honest
communication. So, in addition to knowing,
without any doubt, that your partner wants
eraerly what you’re about to give them, there's
a pretty good opportunity here of learning cote

to please you just how you like it—‘rt’s not just

percent ofvoring snidcnts voted in support the
NDP amendment among other actions to cre
ate a more gender—neutral environment.

VVal-Mart's management does not make
any substantive arguments against the reso
lution. In 2008. when a similar shareholder
resolution was submitted, VVal-Mart’s man-
agement opposed it on the grounds that Wale
Mair has a notable record for diversity in the
work place, which “already appropriately ad-
dresses the concerns set forth in the proposal."
The managements arguments deny the utility
of protection against discrimination based on
gender identity and delegitim . the comic?
tion between safety and gender identity. While
WaleMart may have a strong diversity policy
in regards to other statuses, its current policy
does not actually address the concerns of the
resolution, which focus specifically on gender
identity.

Gender identity is distinct from other sm~
ruses and as such deserves protection. As stats
ed in the resolution, 13 states, including lowa,
93 cities and 30 percent of Fortune 500 Come
panics have included gender identity in none
discrimination laws and policies. These enti-
ries recognize the unique struggles connected
to gender identity and have changed their laws
and policies to offer more protection to their
citizens and employees. WalrMart should {01*
low this example.

With our recommendation. we have ate
tached our new proposal for an advisory Com
mittee on Responsrble Investment (CRI).The
CR1 will work with the Treasures office and
Trustees to create guidelines for shareholder
engagement on behalf of the College and in
vestigate ways the College could further his
corporate it institutional mission in its invest-
ment practicesThis recommendation serves as
an example of the kind ofwell-reasoned argu-
ment the Chi wrll produce.

So when you see a Trustee this weekend,
please tell them you support the resolution and
the development ofa Committee for Responr
sible Investing that can work with the Treasure
and Investment Committee to examine similar
issues in future proxy seasons. Also, ifyou are
curious about Responsible Invcsrmctir email
us at [sri].
