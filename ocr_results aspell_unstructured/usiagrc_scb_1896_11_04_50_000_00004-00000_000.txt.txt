Another thing. It you cannot
possibly see the game at Des
Moines. the least you can do in
llustice is to give the boys the en-
couragement of your presence at
the practice games. Men do bet-
ter work when they know that
1their play will be watched by a
critical audience. We hope to
see better crowds out to the prac-
bice games and we assure you that
you will see good ball.

Michigantehigh Game.

The [netball gamc la<t .
day between the University of
Michigan and Lehigli is interest-

NH"

111g for many reasons, but chiefly
became oi the fact that it is the
only game to be played this year
between colleges representing the
east and the west. The brilliant
victory of Michigan with a score
of 40'0 gives rise to certain very
interesting suppositrons. The
team from Iehigzh has played
teams leprsscntingz all the ~

called "Big Four' institution.
By none of them was she tlefezlt»
ed by so large a score as that in
the game with Michigan. I: it
possible that football haﬁ devel-
oped so rapidly in the west that
now it has a team that would be
able to battle successfully with
anv one in the cast? From Sat-

oossible but in a high degrec
probable. It i: much to be re
gretted that no date has been ar-
ranged by Michigan witll any or
the ﬁrsteclas‘s teams in the east.
tor she now has a splendid oppor
tunity to settle the vaunted ques-
tion of supremacy in her (avor.

The game between Chicago
and Cllampnign last Saturday lure
rushed a surprise to those-who
have been watching the football
seeies this fall, There was a vast
tliﬁcrence between the Chicago

one that represented her the week
before. it was never better illuse
traterl that football scores furnish
a very uncertain means of Com-
parison between rival teams.
