STUDENTS AS ADVERTISEMENTS

Some of the best advertisements of a college are
its students. Publicity has been given to Grinnell an-
uuully by the students composing the Pioneer football,
basketball, track. and tennis teams. This year, in ad-
dition to being known on account of its athletic teams.
Grinnell has been represented by “student advertise-
ments" in the ﬁeld of speech, and during the coming
spring vacation the college will receive publicity from
the concerts of the women's glee club in eastern Iowa
and western Illinois. g.

In Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Minnesota, and
Wisconsin athletes have represented Grinnell in inter-
state college and university contests. From the foot-
bail and basketball standpoint, Grinnell has been well
ndvertised in these Six states.

Men making up the Scarlet and Black track team
have carried the Maltese cross, the track ad of Grin-
nell, to Notre Dame and Illinois, and, before the college
year is over, will wear the Grinneil colors in the Kansas

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

and Drnkc relays. Last year Grinnell wds nntionclly
advertised by the success of its tennis players. Besides
the spring Jaunt into the six states of the southland by
the 1929 tennis quartet, the Pioneers were represented
in eastern summer tournaments by Harris Coggeshail,
No. 14 in national singles ranking inst year, Donnld
Jones, John Kent, George struble nnd Ernest Stowe.
Again this spring vacation Grinnoll will receive publicity
from the activities of its tennis men in the south central
states.

Rejuvenation of “speech advertisements" for Grin-
neil came this year with a program of ﬁfteen debates,
Men and women students represented Grinnell in varsity
debates with South Dakota, Iowa. State, Drake, Cornell,
and (:02. Students of the undergraduate speaking ex-
change two years ego took the name of Grinneil to
Oberlin, Beloit, Carleton, and Knox.

Women singers are often considered the best stur
dent advertisements of a college, For the ﬁrst time in
four yeers Prof. George L. Pierce and the Grinnell Col~
lego Women’s Glee club are scheduled for o tour during
the ﬁrst part of spring vacation. The twenty-ﬁve co-
eds, who will make the trip, will frequent some cities
in their schedule of concerts where Grinnell is not
widely known. It is in these pieces tbnt the women
will serve as the student advertisements of Grinnell Col—
lege.

Grinnell students can be of much advertising value
to the college in their home towns during spring vaca-
tion. When college students are home for the spring
recess, their associations with high school seniors make
the latter become more aware that, if they are going
to continue their schooling. now is the time for select-
ing s college to attend next fall. Grinnell students,
many of whom are friends and some former classmates
of the 1930 high school graduates, can prove themselves
as student advertisements by boosting Grinnell as the
proper institution for them to enroll in next fall.

PRESIDENT HUTCHINS' PROGRAM

Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, who sit the age of
thirty became president of Cbiesgo university, is to
carry out a program which will involve many changes
in university administration and in the steps leading up
to the conferring of the university's degrees.

Heretofore the usual classes for undergraduates,
freshmen. sophomores, juniors and seniors, and in ad—
dition the graduate school, have been recognized.
Under a new plan, just announced, there will be but
three groups, and they will consist of collegiate, univer—
sity and graduate.

Upon their entrance to the university new students
will be enrolled in the collegiate department. Their
progress there will depend entirely upon their mentality.
If they make the right sort of progress they will be ad-
Vanced to the university division. When they complete
their advanced work in that division they will get
their degrees.

Many changes will take piece in the postgraduate
school. It will be virtually remodeled by the new presA
ident. The graduate school has been very notable and
will doubtless be still more so under the regime of
President Hutchins. A heavy enrollment will enable
him to introduce various improvements. The changes
in the reguler student course will revolutionize the
undergraduate system of education.
