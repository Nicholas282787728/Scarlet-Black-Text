Journalisls' Roasiing Session Dinner

Has Bu'i Shor’r Hisl'

Razzing and roasting on the
Grinnell campus is as old as the
college itself, but the annual
dinner devoted to that pastime is
comparatively new.

Sigma Delta Chi, national honors
ary and professional journalistic
fraternity, sponsored the first
“Razz Banquet" Nov. 17, 1933, as
a part of the Homecoming pres
gram,

Matlack

Roastemnster for that session
was the late Henry W. Matlack,
professor of organ. A four page
“Razz sheet" and skits on campus
life were featured.

There was no roasting session
the next year; but on Friday the
thirteenth, 1935, the chapter pl'c»
sented ”Grinnell stumbles Back-
ward." Skits were in the nature
of blackouts, satiiizing the fa»
culty and students.

Co-spousol‘ship

Feb. 24, 1937 the journalists
presented “The Pearly Gates" in
the quadrangle dining room. It
was the first banquet under the
co-sponsorship of Sigma Delta
Chi and Theta Sigma Phi, we»
men’s journalistic fraternity.

This year’s roasting session,
which will be staged in the quad-

rangle dining room Wednesday

evening, is once again under the
cessponsorship of the two jour-
nalistic chapters. In addition to
the dinner and the new “Razz
Sheet," the scribes will present
“A Night in a Lunatic Asylum,"
the majority of the skits and im-
personations being based on one
central idea on the campus.

Work of writing the skits is
now complete, and the journalists
will begin rehearsing for the pro-
gram the first of the Week. stag-
ing and lighting is under way,
and tickets have now been placed
on sale.

price for the cosmetics you smear
on it is no guarantee that your
skin will suffer no ill effects, exV
