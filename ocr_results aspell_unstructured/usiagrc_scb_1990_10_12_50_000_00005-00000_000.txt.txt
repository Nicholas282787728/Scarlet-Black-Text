A combine harvester on an arable farm. Monocultural farming, the farming of only one
crop on a large plot, is a major concern of the Grinnell College Farrners’ Interest Group.

Campus Group Fights
to Save the Family Farm

By Tom Gregg

Erosion, groundwater pollution,
and dependence on govemmeni
subsidies are all problems thatcon—
tn'bute to a disastrous system of
farming, according to Darin
Robertson and Rob White, who re-
cently founded the Farmers Inter-
est Group (FIG) as a way of com-
bating the current problematic state
ofagricullure in America today,

Since farming is, in the wordsof
one FIG member, "what feeds us"
andis“conneeled with everything,"
affecting worldwide economics and
politics, FIG looks for a solution
for farming problems.

Crop “monoculture” is one of
the issues that FIG attacks. Me-
noculture is the intensive farming
ofoneplotofiand by plantingmany
acres with a single species of crop.
The benefits ofthis type offarming
areitsease,itsrelativelyhighayield,
and its acceptance in the agricul-
tural community (though it is
presently falling out of favor in
some quarters).

The major drawbacks are that
many additives such as pesticides
and nitrate fertilizers must be put
on the crop and into the soil in order
for it to provide consistent yields
every year,and thatit increases soil
erosion tremendously.

Anothcrissuewith which FIG is
concerned is the proliferation of

“corporate farms" which the group
sees as degrading to the environ-
ment, to the land, and to the work-
ers. Such corporate fannsare huge,
monocultural, highly automated,
mechanized, capilal—intensive and
profit-maximizing. This picture
stands instark conirastto the idyllic
picture of small, friendly, rural
farming communities.

FIG emphasizes the implemen-
tation of sustainable agriculture as
an altemaiive. By “sustainable,“
FIG advocates a wide range of
practices with the common theme
that, once implemented, these
practices can be maintained over
the long run, taking into account
pnnciplesofthe scienceofccology.

“Sustainable agriculture" imr
plies a rejection of shortrtcrm eco
nomic gain asanend offarmtng. It
includes practices suchasiritcgmtetl
pest management, which uses
predatory insects to get rid of crop
damaging insects; crop polycullure,
in which a field is sown with two or
threedifferentcrops instead of one;
and reduced use of petrochemicals.
FIG also is interested in expanding
the concept of sustainability to ap-

ply to whole farming communities
and rural culture.

FIGexisLstoeducaleandinforirt
its members about agriculture so
they might be able to change some
of the allegedly harmful practices
that farming engages in today,

“Liberal art; students Will be
making really crucial decmons
later," said White, so the processof
change begins with the education
and mobilization of college stue
dents.

The origin of FIG was in a sus-
tainable agriculture independent
study that the founding members
participated in last semester. The
product of the independent study
was a proposal to the administra»
tion that agriculture be incorpo»
rated into the curriculum. This
proposal specifically includes
farmingclasscsandtheinitiationof
a studentrrun organic farm. FIG
wasstartcdthisscmesterto“provide
a firm baseofinterest in agriculture
so as to provide good support for
the classes. . . and the farm.”

FIG meets on Wednesdays at
9:00pm intheFonim'sPDRB,and
“all are welcome."

Gay Rights Group
Changes Stance

By Tara Neavins

Thursday October II was Na-
tional Coming Out Day. The
Grinnell Community In End
Homophobia (GCEH), formerly
Grinnell Lesbian and Gay Alliance
(OLGA). sponsored several activi-
liCS. study breaks were held in
several dorms beginning on Tues
titty evening. They were n “forum
to askquesuons andtoleam utrough
role playing", explained Heather
Terrence, a GCEH member.

Mostvisibiy.GCEl—ldtstributed
neon pink arm bands to students in
the Post Office to show support for
the rights of gays and bisexuals,
Mttny studcnts also wore buttons
and lrShli’lS to show support. In the
evening a party to celebrate Come
ing Out Day was held in the Hue
man/Gay Resource Center.

Among the reasons for the
change in the group’s name is that
there was a great need to make
bisexuals and allies (supporters of
the gay and bisexual rights move-
ment) feel welcome Terrence
commented,“Wevaluethesupport
of the allies and their input.“ The
old name was simply “too exclur
sive and did not give allies and
bisexuals the recognition and re»
spect they deserved." In the past.
“there was a lot of dissent" among
the group's members as to what the
nature of the group was,explained
Alanna Walen. Consequently,
GLGA became confused with the
various gay, lesbian, and bisexual
social groups on campus.

GCEI-I encouragesinvolvemcnt
in such social groups in order to
promote the gay and bisexual cul»
lure. Feeling thatthis social aspect
has already been addressed at
Grinnell, GCEl-I is determined to
be a political group instead. It in-
tends to educate the campus as well
as the community at large about
gay and bisexual issues and to have
its meetings open to anyone, re-

“Itwasnndcrstootlthattohnvca
stronger and more meaningful ef-
fect on the population, we first of
tilt needed ti liirgcr group,“ said
Mira Miliar, “and we needed to
change our image from it support
group to a politically active group.
More importantly, our image as a
politically separatist group was
losing support in the community."
By keeping GCEH open to all.
members hope that more discus-
sion and conscience-raising will be
triggered, leudtng to political ace
tion. However,inthtseurly stagcof
its transformation to an InlIinSlr
cullypoliticttlgroup,GCEI-l is most
concerned with building commu-
nity support rather than engineer-
ingunyspcciiicpoliticalcampaign.
Another aspect of GCEH that
may undergo change is its organi-
zation. Currently, there is no preslr
dcnt, no hierarchy and no Commllr
tees. Rather, members take turns at
being me weekly facilitator, the
person who conducts the meeting.
Although GCEH feels this method
ts effective, it would like to see
tasks delegated in a more orderly
fashion and give those outside the
group more names to contact.
Other activities that GCEH has
planned for this academic year in-
clude four Grinnellians going Iothe

Force (NGL'IF), a conference on
“Creating Change“ from Novcmr

described “Pride Week" as the
“culmination"ofGCEI-I'sacti'vities
and saw a need for having a sepa
rate committee to plan this event.
