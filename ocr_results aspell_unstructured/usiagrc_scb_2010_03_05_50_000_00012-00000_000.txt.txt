Well done, bias?
motivated incidents
response protocol

We'd like to applaud another enactment of one of the
Hate Crime and Bias-Motivated incident Response Proto»
col codes—namely, the automatic sending of an all-campus
e-mail to every member of the campus community. Because
of the quick and speedy response called for in the protocol,
students and staff were able to quickly mobilize against the
incidents of vandalism on campus posters. The Student 0,,
ganization of Latino/as (SOL) held a forum, and is holding
another next week Because information of the incidents was
in every community member’s inbox, the attendance was
stronger than it would have been if the primary form of com-
municarion had been scattered announcements or word of
mouth.

Also, notiﬁcation to the whole campus keeps reality in our
face. Grinnell College may be more ofa safe-space than your
average school, but bias and oppression are still everyday re-
ab'ties. so kudos to all who formed the protocol for helping
the student body respond and keeping us in check with what
happens on campus.

Thoughts on housing

Historically speaking, one of the few perks of not be-
ing a first year is the ability to better choose your living
environment. After a full year of Grinnell living, it is imv

possible to not notice a distinctly unique characteristic dire
ference between various campus residential regions. As such,
second years and above, for the most part, go to great lengths
to secure the best-possible room with the bestepossible loca-
tion. On the front page, the reader can find details ofa sena-
tor's struggle with housing, which involved an eviction from
James to Cowles, and a subsequent relocation back to James,
to a room across the hall. While the situation did eventually
resolve itself, we are most concerned with housing’s inabil-
ity to better take into account the senatorrlnrquestion’s living
preferences, which speciﬁcally included both South Campus
and sub-free.

Before we get too excited, it is important to realize how
we got ourselves into a situation where this might be an issue.
The housing contract that each student
is forced to sign (but deﬁnitely
not read) stipulates that the Col—
lege maintains the right. to move
students so as to accommodate
whatever apparent needs arise in
housing allocation. This of course
includes roommate disputes,
health concerns and other situa-
tions that may require a room switch,
and we understand the need to maximize resources for un-
predictable circumstances. When all is said and done, how»
ever, the fact that this particular senator’s best-choice scenario
involves moving into a room across the halls/as opposed to,
say, staying in their own room—is something that could be
improved upon.

The fact of the matter is that an extremely coincidental
situation should not have been this senator’s only choice to

Roxanne Conlin for Senator

Wc’rt: Fighting with Roxanne.

Sometimes rare opportunities emerge, big and small, to
catalyze a transformational change-to set a brushﬁre in the
corridors ofpower. In 2005, Grinnellians saw such an opportu
nity when Eric Palmer declared his candidacy against archcone
scrvarive Danny Carroll, the number three Republican in the
Iowa House. We worked hard, turned out a record number of
students, and delivcrcd Eric the slim margin ofvictoryhe need—
ed. As a result, Democrats took over the majority in the Iowa
House for the first time in a decade. Eric and the new House
leadership went on to raise the minimum wage for the 300,000
Iowans who were making $5.15 an hour, substantially raise
teacher pay, lift the stare ban on stem cell research and pass civil
rights legislation to protect Iowans of all ethnic backgrounds
and sexual orientations from discrimination in the workplace.

2010 again represents such an opportunity This time, how—
ever, the target is bigger—the stakes are higher. The opportunir
ty is for Iowa to send its first woman to Washington, Roxanne
Conlin, and to defeat one of the most powerful conservative
leaders in the nation, Chuck Grassley. Just in case you haven't
been introduced, Grassley is that exceedingly senile and frus-
trating ﬁgure that’s been running around the airwaves talking
about death panels and "pulling the plug on grandma." During
the course of his 50 plus years in public service, he has been
the unapologetic embodiment of everything that is so wrong
with Washington. He has taken millions of dollars from the

health insurance and coal industries, sent our troops to fight an
unnecessary war in Iraq, and gave out bailouts to Wall street
while leaving Main Street behind.To top it all off, this year the
League ofConservauon Voters gave Grassley’s environmenral
voting record a zero percent rating, he voted against equal pay
for women twice and, when asked to denounce Uganda’s pro-
posal to introduce the dearh penalty for homosexuals, crassley
initially refused.

Compared to Chuck, Roxanne would be an unmistakable
breath offresh air. We‘d not only be sending Iowa's firsr woman
to Washington, we’d be sending an emphatic message: business
as usual but acceptable. Having gotten to know Roxanne over
the past tew monrhs,l can tell you that she gets it. Roxanne had
to wait tables to help support her family as a young girl, but still
managed to work her way through law school. graduating at
the tender age ole. She went on to become one ofour nation's
first female U.S. Attorneys and, later, the first female president
of the powerful U.S.'I‘nal Lawyers Association. She knows that
healthcare is a fundamental human right, that we need to start
getting serious about climate change and that no one should
be denied the right to marry. Most importantly, she knows that
sometimes we need to stand up and ﬁghr for the progress we
wrsh to see.

Yes, change has been invariably slow and disappointing, but
that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth lighting for. Let‘s send Roxanne
to Washington and make Chuck put up the red light!

'stay in the housing situation he specifically chose to live
in. Housing should have approached the situation from the
perspective that the student’s housing preferences, above
all things, should be given first priority That being said. we
would like to applaud housings prompt response to the sit»
uation—we simply believe that the consolidation process
could be improved, and we hope that this particular sena-
tor takes steps to continue discussions regarding the issue.

Thanks comic relief

Sometimes, in response to loss or a large-scale catas-
trophe, just about all we can do is laugh. Laughter can be
brave—at oncc acknowledging how little control we really

have, how small we are and asserting our
will to goon, happily even.

And so we want to congratulate
last Friday’s srandrup funnies, the
various witty Grinnellians who threw
themselves to the proverbial comedic
wolves——packed into Bob’s Under-
ground all the way to the hallway—
to make us laugh and send some

dollars to people who need them. Overall
the event not only provided a kind of escapeior at least
comic reliefﬁfrom the weight of the events in Haiti, it also
raised almost $300 towards the relief effort. Stand-up com—
edy purely for entertainment is all fine and good, but this
show’s effort—and the audience’s laughs and donations—
deserves special recognition. You all were selfedeprecuting,
goofy, ironic, dry, a little off-color, smart, profoundly human
and overall, pretty f“"ing hilarious.

Thank You from the Booths

Grinnell College Students, Staﬂ’ and Faculty,

Words cannot express how blessed we have been though
this difﬁcult time in our lives.

All ofyour donations and gifts ofkindness have been more
than what we could have ever imagined.

We are so grateful to Live in a community with so many
kind and giving people.

We would love [0 take this time to say THANK YOU, to
each and everyone who is helping us rebuild our life and our
home.

A response to the bias-

To whomever is responsible, you are an imbecile. Beyond
that, your worth is negligible, your style is trite and your slurs
are counterfeit.

attack a srudenr whose back is only wetter than yours because
