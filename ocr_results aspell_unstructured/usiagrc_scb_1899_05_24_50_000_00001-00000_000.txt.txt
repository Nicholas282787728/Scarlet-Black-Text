Grinncll Institute will hold its
regular meeting next Wednesday
evening, in Prof, Cole’s room in'
the conservatory. on account of
the recital to be given in the
chapel the same evening,

state Meet.

Next Friday Grinnell's track
team, six years winners in the nine
meets of the Iowa intercollegiate
Athletic association, will be called
upon to Show of what stuff it is
made. Thirty..ic...t..edandtrue,
after long and faithful training
under the assiduous “Jack.” will
don their spikes and uhoppers" to
defend the scarlet and black in
what is regarded the greatest athe
letic event of the year in Iowa.
On them is now centered the chief
interest of the student body. Our
defeat in the Dtlal Mcct. so far
from dampening enthusiasm, has
rather heightened interest in the
success oithe team. Good friends
in other schools have said of us
that we are never licked till licked.
It was never more true of Grinnell
than at the present writing. We
have been defeated once and on
that scorc have not one word of
complaint to utter. It is a thing
of the past. But we have another
chance and. naturally, cannot rc-
sist an impulse to make the most
of it.

Not only is this true of otlr gal-
lnnt athletes. who have worked
with unceasing zeal sincethe Dual
Meet, but of many others. Lat-
terly even the “dig" has been
moved to crawl apacc from his re-
treat. He has cast his weary eyes
over-,tlte situation and alrnostunan-
imously concluded to attend the
Stat Meet. The wave of,enthusi-
asm is 1' ing on high tide and the
ebb will notbe witnessed until our
colors arelowered in Dcs Moines,
If that is done we shall silently
steal home in the night and muse
by way of consolation, that "the
situation has at least the charm of
novelty if nothing else."

date to amend an erroneous opi -
ion let its unanimously conclude
that Grinnell has never been de-
feated except in one way—fairly.
If a designing umpire has reirrsed
to give us the requisite ten yards
and the hall thrown in, when we
were within [5 yards of our Oppclr
nets‘ goal, and some one asks us
how it all happened; if a base
and unscrupulous judge of the
ﬁnish awards us only third place
when we have won hands down
and our tacetious contemporaries
inquire why we lost; yea, per-
chance, should a home run hit in
the ninth inning. with three men
on bases, be adjudged a foul, let
us all swell the joyful pasan (to
those who do not sympathize with
the scarlet and black) that we were
beaten purely on the merits of the
contest. So, and only so, will
Grinncll be defeated in the State
Meet. We will. possibly, get sec-
ond place, but only because we
are unable to procure enough
points to get ﬁrst.

Coming more directly to the
matter in question, what will we
do for our track team at the State
Meet? Without being boastful
we nray state that Grinnell has an
even chance to win. Few, if any,
of our team. will fall to do better
than inthc Dual Mect. The men
who wear the “G" are all bona ﬁde
students who enter athletics not
for selﬁsh ends, but for the glory
of Grinnell. They have exhibr
ited commendable sacriﬁce and
are deserving of substantial recog-
nition in this, therr last, big con-
test of the year, The Rock Isl-
and has generously ottered a onc~
fare rate of 51,65 {or the round
trip. tickets good returning Mon-
day. If [soticketsare sold a Spe-
cial train will be given, leaving
Grinnell about 7:30 in the morn-
ing and returning. will leave Des
Moincs about 8:30. The excurr
sion tickets will not be honored
on the ﬂyer and fast mail, hence,
unless the special is procured,
Grinnell‘s delegation must either
go to Des Moines Thursday night
or leave at 11:27 Friday morning,
reaching destination barely a halfr
hour betore the meet begins.

Without desiring to misreprer
scnt our friends down theroad we
may, perhaps. say that they ex.
pect the old gold to be on top,

 

and S. U. l. has a habit of being
out in force when there is such a
prospect. Drake has several hunr
dred lusty roo|ers who can very
conveniently manifest themselves
at the seat of hostilities, while
even Anres, which admittedly has
no chance to win, promises to pro
senta delegation of too. There
will be cheers in abundancc for
the others, Will Grinncll show
equal loyalty to its athletes?

The prospects of the several
teams have becn liberally dis
cussed in the Des Moines papers
the past three weeks. By this
time those specially interested
have somewhat deﬁnite ideas who
will win most of the events, A few
things not generally known. how.
ever, have changed the complex
ion ot things a triﬂe, and tor these
facts allowance must be made. It
is now an open secret that Captarn

Holland. of Drake, will not be in ’

the meet. Final action has not
been taken on his case. but there
is little doubt that he will be dis»
qualiﬁed by the games committee
on the ground ot professionalism.
He was conceded to be a sure winr
nor in the running broad and hop,
step and jump, with good pros
pect of picking up ﬁve or ten
points in other events. It is be
lieved thathisdisqualiﬁcationdoes
away with all Drake's chances of
winning, However. it is not well
to be overconﬁdcnt. Our Des
Moines contemporaries have nth~
crs in their lists and will doubtless
be heard from before the contest
is over.

From the best information that
can be obtained, Grinnell has ex
cellent chances of winning the
three dashes and the two huldlcs.
On no other events can we count
so certainly as these. Excepting
Fuller. otUpper Iowa. there is no
other man who would appear dan-
gerous to Captain Spaulding and
Skiff. He is reported to be run-
ning in ﬁne form, brrt his chances
are regarded ruuch better in the
quarter than in thc dashes, We
should be in at the ﬁnish on the
bicycle races and can ﬁgure on a
few points in the mile walk. En-
gelke's wrist is slowly improving,
and if the inﬂammation subsides
he will doubtless go close to to
feet in the pole vault.
