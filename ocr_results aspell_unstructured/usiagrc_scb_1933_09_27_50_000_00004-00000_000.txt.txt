Altho rated the underdogs, the
Pioneers will have an edge over
Michigan state when they meet at
East Lansing Saturday afternoon, in
that they have already played their
first game of the season, and the ex-
citement. and anticipation of the
first game will have worn off, so
that a victory over the Spartans
would more than avenge the K0-
hawk defeat.

c a s

A Michigan State conch reports
ed that the Lansing fans liked the
Grinnell team, called thorn colorful,

and considered them one of the
best tennis they had seen play dur»
ing the 1932 season, both in ability
and in sportsmanship. That comes
from a school whose team beat us

27 to G.

in.

mmwial difficulties, and others
have lira-Wu ilnother check mnrk
on Grinnell intercollegiate sports,
for it, has been definitely decided
to abandon the cross-country tendiL
plans are now under way to hold
a full track meet which will fea—
ture a cross-country race. At the
present time Joe Pfcilfcr, captain
of the track team, is ineligible for
cross-court”, Tom Gordon has it
job that would not permit time for
training, and Joe Mollrath is the
only member of the brilliant “big
foul" from last year .who would be
able to compete as n hauler. It
seems rather ironicnl that on the
season following a championship
squad. both swimming and cross
country should be eliminated from
the Grilmell spoits calendar. Both
sports uereattraot-ing a great deal
oi attention to the school.
a s i
A call for freshmen football ma—
te'rihl will be made the first of next
Week, and from the size of some of
the “green ones,” it seems probable
that another bunch of promising men
will report. So far no all-state ma-
terial has been revealed.

Freshmen Learn Glossary of Campus
Terms Here, Including “Westfield”

Location of Confusing Sims

Explained Lo Yearlings

Freshmen at Grinnell have a new
vocabulary and glossary of common
terms to learn. For their informa-
tion, the following bits of scattered
knowledge are offered.

The “quad” and "dorms” naturally
refer to the women’s quadrangle and
men's dormitories. The campus
proper, on which smoking is pro—
hibited until 6 pm, includes all of
the campus except that occupied by
the men's dormitories and the ath-
letic fields.

Word and Melzlrchron
Ward field is the field on which
the stadium is situated. McEachron
field is the freshman practice field.
The swimming pool is located in its
own building directly northwest of
the women's ouadrangle.

The Bradley pin-oaks are situated
near the flagpole on the campus
proper. Chicago hall is also called
the administration building. Rawson
hall is still familiarly known by up-
perclassmen as “Kelly Stables."
Main Hall

Main hall, freshman cottage, was
formerly known as Central. The
Women’s cottages are known by their-
numbers from Two to Five, rather
than by their names, except for
Mears and Main,

i In telephoning a resident of tho
quadrangle, the room number should
preferably be given to college cen-
tral, but in telephoning a resident
of the dormitories, the floor and hail
‘name should be given.
I The women's gymnasium is known
as hand gymnasium. The “bot gar-
dens,n are the botanical gardens
southwest of the quadrangle and
across highway (i from the campus
proper. _
Westfield is the site of an ”Arab
village” about four miles southwest
of Griunell. . .

l Campus Opinion i

revived”!

Dwight Cilmllbell: The two fat‘r
tors which have chiefly prevented a.
performance of the Pioneer Prudities
the last three years have been lack
of sufficient talent) and Inability to
finance the program. If these diffi-
Culties (18.11 be overcome, I would be
heartily in favor Of 2|. revival of the
Frudities.

Dink Mason: There are students
who are just as much interested in

New Students!

Hello Old!

We‘re glad to have

displaying their talents on the stage,
as others are on the athletic field,
but who are not qualified, or do not
have the time, for major productions
of the drama department. The Pio-
neer Prndities should be a part of
our program.

Dick Salmon: The Pioneer Frudr

I ities should be revived because they

provide a diversification in the
amusemcnt of the colleg‘e and because
they will encourage building campers.»
tion which is so essential to thc well-
being of the school. I am whole
heartedly in favor of them,

Vernon Peters: The Fruditles
should be given another trial; but
work should start immediately if
they are to be a success, as everyone
will be busy later in the year,
