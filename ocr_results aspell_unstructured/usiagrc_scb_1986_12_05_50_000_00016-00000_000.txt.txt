vesior. From Graham, Buffett learned ﬁle
art of scouting undervalued stocks to buy
for the long term. For in the long term said
Graham. the market will warm up to
them.

Successful since the first investment
firm he launched at 25. Buffett has often
sat back and watched Wall Street squirm.
In reference to a recent bout of merger
mania, Buffett cited Pascal's famous
observation: “.,.that all men's misfors
tunes spring from the single cause that
they are unable to stay quietly in one
room.”

Buffett. a Grinnell trustee since 1968,
must have taken both Graham and Pascal
to the board meeting I0 years ago in which
he proposed the purchase of a small TV

station in Dayton. Ohio A college buying a
small Ohio station? A risky venture for
most administrators, let alone scholars.
However. Grinnell crossed their fingers
and bought the station from Avco for $12.9
million. Five years later. Grinnell sold out
to the Hearst Corporation for $50 million; a
move which in itself. doubled the college’s
endowment. Today, Grinnell’s $200 million
endowment makes it the second wealthiest
school per capita in the country.

But just behind Harvard and ahead of
Yale. Grinnell remains a small modest
school of the liberal arts. Its billionaire
trustee. Warren Buffett, remains modest
and in touch with his three maxims: 1)
Never lose money, 2)Never forget it.

Drugs

and students at the Sixth grade level spend
three weeks learning about chemical
dependencies. "including cigarettes."

The schools. then. are quite exhaustive
in their educational endeavors. So why are
they not as effective as they would like to
be? One reason may be the manner with
which the subject matter is dealt. With
regard to the health classes, Mark Brown
said, “Some of the films are actually fun»
ny” in the way they depict drug addictions.

Further. some national events indicate
that the schools may not be able to provide
a complete answer. For example, Beau-
mont. Texas, superintendent Mike Taylor
recently proposed mandatory drug testing
for the city‘s 6th through 12th graders. Ac-
cording to the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
MONITOR, this proposal arose irom his
frustration over an inability to make any
headway ill reducing drug use by students.
He says his schools have “done the same
things everyone else is doing. but we’ve
been doing all that ior 10 years and we‘re
no better off."

What is the key“! "Well. students are
pointing the finger at permissive parents,”
says Dixon. “Parents should know about
their role model status , . . and need to

reinforce the efforts of the school,"

As the parent oi a‘ high school»age
daughter. Grinneil College professor Gene
Wubbels says the results of the survey are
”very grave". adding, “but I'm not going
to go jump out a window and kill myself."
Quoting St. Paul, Wubbels said. “We know
what is right. but we’re not very well able
to do it," He said this reasoning applies not

only to drug usage,‘ but also to the difficult-

parental role as disciplinarian and
teacher.

The school board is considering in-
stituting a drug awareness program for
parents.

one of the must alarming results of the
survey concerned drunk driving. the
number one cause oi death in the 1924 age
group, ”About one student in six . . and
almost a quarter of the males report driv-
ing after drinking.“ In response to this,
Dixon pointed out that the students “don't
think anything can happen to them. It
always happens to someone else."

Sgt. Shutts attributes this attitude large-
ly on television viewing. “TV programs
the viewer to believe that death isn’t per-
manent.” he said,

day." states Gary Knoblock. who studied
in Vienna last fall. There are always
policemen on guard against terrorist ai-
tacks in front of certain travel agencies 7
notably the Israeli and the Iraqi ones — of
embassies, And ”whenever the OPEC
ministers met in the downtown Hilton, fife
teen guards stood in from of the hotel with
machine guns."

In Israel, too, terrorism is come
monplace, When Laura Allender lived on
an Israeli kibbutz in 1979, the PLO was
shelling the kibbutz and neighboring
Israeli settlements The children of the
kibbutz slept in rooms protected against
bomb bl sts Kibbutz members would eat
in a similarly protected dining hall. while
bombs could be heard detonating outside.

As they react diiierently to terrorism.
Europeans tend to disagree with the pre-
sent American government over the ap-
propriate means of combatting terrorism.
Kevin O'Prey. who spent the fall of 1935 in
London, remarked that many Europeans
found Reagan's tough talk on terrorism
counterproductive. Reagan was seen as
promoting terrorism by trying to right it.

The differences in foreign and American
perceptions oi terrorism point out the subs
jectivity inherent in labeling an act as
“terrorist." In addition, these differences
underscore the fact that no American
"war on terrorism" can be successful
without aiming to modify American
perceptions oi terrorism. The weapons of a
terrorist are psychological: fear. panic.
and humiliation. If Americans were to
restrain their reaction. terrorist acts
would be less efficacious,
