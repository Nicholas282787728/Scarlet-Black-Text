With the season half over, the
Tulsa Hurricanes have kept their
lead in thc valley intact. The oli-
men have but one conference game
left on the docket and that is with
Drake, Nov. 12.

The defending champions are so
superior to any team in the con—
ference that an upset in that con-
test is considered quite unlikely,

Only two conference games are
scheduled this weekend, while the
other teams will all be engaging
nonrconference opponents. Wash-
burn college and Oklahoma A. 5.:
M. tangle at Stillwater, with the
Aggies rated as favorites to win
their first Valley game of the
year.

Drake and Grinnell meet for the
45th renewal of their traditional
stniggle, with the Bulldog powen
house ranked as a top heavy fa-
vorite. Neither one of these con
tests will have much significance
on the final standings.
