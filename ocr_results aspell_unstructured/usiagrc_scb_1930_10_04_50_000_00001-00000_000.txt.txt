Byrd Address

Mrs. Leonard at Banquet

for Aerial Hero
in Chicago

Mrs. Blanche Leonard, house moths
er of Cottage Five, had an unusual
experience this summer, when she
attended a banquet in honor of Rear
Admiral Richard E. Byrd and the
four Chicago men who accompanied
him on his South pole ﬂight.

Mrs. Leonard was in.France at the
time Byrd crossed the Atlantic and
went to Ver-sur—Mer to see him.

2,000 Attcnd Banquet

The banquet for Byrd was given
at Hotel Stevens by the Chicago
Press club, which helped to make
Byrd's expedition to the Antarctic
possible. Nearly 2,000 guests were
present at the banquet.

, Rear Admiral Byrd gave a
humorous speech. When speak—
ing of choosing his men for the
polar trip, he said that he chose
them, not for efﬁciency alone, but
chiefly for their loyalty. Bach of his
men responded to his request for a
row words, although Byrd expressed
doubt as to whether their loyalty ex-
tended as far as speech making.

Youth to Go Again

The hall was decorated and the
banquet was planned to be represen-
tative of Byrd’s expedition. The fa-
vors were miniature cardboard air-
planes.

One of the Chicago men of the
Antarctic expedition, Lloyd Greenlie.
already has been asked by Byrd to
accompany him on his next trip.
Greenlie is only a boy or 19 but Byrd
placed him above the other men of
the expedition in courage and loyal—
