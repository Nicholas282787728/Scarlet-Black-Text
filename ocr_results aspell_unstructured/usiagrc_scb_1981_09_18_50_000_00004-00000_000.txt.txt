It!" urogram deserves
a llllllllllg chance

There is a great pleasure that comes along with the job of writing
editorials and that is giving praise to an action or idea that we think is
deserving. The Leisurely Dining Program is just that type of idea.

Food Service Director Dave McConnell has come up with what we
think is the perfect type of dining situation for a college like Grinnell to
be sponsoring.

The Leisurely Dining Program is really a very simple idea. The pro-
gram will allow students and faculty to get together at Grinnell House
and enjoy a nice meal and some conversation, There will be nothing pres
planned or structured — just a chance for everyone to interact outside of
the classroom.

It is really no big deal and yet it is. This type of program is what a
residential college is all about. We came here so that we could get to
know our professors as people. instead of as voices speaking to us from
in front of a blackboard. As for the professors, it is hoped that‘s why the
faculty that is at Grinnell chose to be here, so that they could get to know
the students as people instead of just as faces staring up at them tor 50
minutes three times a week.

The cost of participating in the program is quite nominal. Students on
board only have to fork over (pardon the pun) $3.50 and everyone else
has to pay $5. Hey, from a purely economic point of view you can’t beat
it. McConnell has planned some delicious sounding menus and there is
no way you could eat comparable meals in a restaurant for these prices.
Even if you are a little strapped for funds McConnell has scheduled the
program on some nights when there will be “special dinners” in the din
ing halls. That means on those days students on board could participate
in the program for free.

McConnell said that he informed the faculty of the program at the first
faculty meeting and there is a description of it in ﬁle Grinnell College
Food Service Catering and Special Services Guide which each faculty
member received at the beginning of the year. Students can watch the
Memo for more details on the program which begins next week. So
nobody can use the excuse that they never heard about it for not going.

We believe this to be a truly worthwhile venture and strongly urge
students and faculty to participate and make it a success.

Socrates was right

Boy. did I goof. Last time i said that so
meone was putting whole milk into the
skim milk dispenser. Well. I‘m not a food
service worker so [didn‘t understand the
inner workings of Cowles Dining Hall.
Hence, 1 implied that someone who put
whole milk into the Skim milk dispenser
was a nipnort and linguini brain. Well. I
was wrong, It was two percent milk. not

Socrates believed that humans were born
with all the knowledge in the world. He
claimed that nothing was learned but that
instead. everything had just been “brought
to the surlace" at one time or another.

Many people scoff at such thinking but I
have prooi that he was at least partially
correct.

l have met quite a lew people who were
born with complete knowledge oi one suhr
ject. You know the type The people who
were never in a situation where they didn’t
know and had to ask at someone who did
know. The people who are not only annoyed
that others were not born with complete
knowledge but are even disgusted.

I suppose they put up with us linguini
brains who were not blessed with
knowledge at hirth because we provide
them with a good Joke now and then

I think that it looks all right from the outside
but I think there is a major structural flaw tn. it
because it makes it more crowded The way they
have it weave in and out — [think that's i1 major
problem. As long as you go in an off time of day
youll be on right.

Janet Scannell

I think the outside looks a lot better and inside
is ok when there aren't a whole lot of people in
there. But it gets kind of crowded when people
are trying to get into the corners, .
