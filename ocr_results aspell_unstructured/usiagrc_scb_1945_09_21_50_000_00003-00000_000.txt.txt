A COLUMN OF
PURE BEAUTY

Say, speaking of sparklers,
we just couldn't help noticing
the heavy pair the former Bev
Soil has been carrying around,
Nice going, Mrs. Ber-man.

Like Chopin? Pay Dylsrnan
does, and she really does justice
to the Polonaise. Why not drop
around to Mears parlor sometime
and listen. .

We miss Ed Long, but it looks
like we won‘t have to long. Tak-
‘ing his place, complete with raw
ing eye and Beta pin is Dave
Macketh—one of the few Dibble-
ites this year.

If a wild eyed gal with a big
barrett roars past you with ﬁre
in her eye, keep your distance:
It's probably Umbright on the

' warpath for Harley who sems to
have made off with her trunk
in a weak moment.

Remember Ruthie person, the
gal with the voice? Well, you'll
be seeing her little sister, Tom-
my around if you haven't al-
ready. And speaking of ramilies,
there are not one but two Brun~
liars now and both with pink
hair. Didn't think it was pos-
sible.

We've always heard that “they
just can't stay away from Grin-
riell," and We’re beginning to be-
have it now that Murdoch’s back.
Hi, Bob.

Say, is Jack Clmflee’s main
interest in life {Gotham—that's
what they say. But it’s begin-
ning to look like Jackie Iteed,
complete with bruises, is holding
her own.

Say, Poweu, how come all
these mad phone calls to Read
last Monday night? Kind of
lookalike Eenie has a mind of
her own, doesn‘t it?

Just as a parting shot. we'd
like to wish the fellows good
luck on their open house tonight.
From what we’ve heard, posts
tively everyone’s going, and we
think it’s a swell idea. Nothing
like sharing the wealth!
