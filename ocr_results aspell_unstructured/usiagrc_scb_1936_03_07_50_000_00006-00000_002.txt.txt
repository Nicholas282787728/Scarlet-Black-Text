alike there exists a common fear, that of the dentist's
drill rnsping through dentine in seeming horrible
search for the nerve, No lean scholar is Dr. LeRoy L.
Hartman of Columbia's dental school, yet from his
laboratory he has come forth with a discovery that
entailed twenty years of

research. As a conse'

quence, the dental bogey

mane pain, is now gone,

are polishing tools for

school in roig. Dr. Hartman interrupted private

practice in Seattle to go to war. On his return he

assailed dental pain. Now ready for general use, his
