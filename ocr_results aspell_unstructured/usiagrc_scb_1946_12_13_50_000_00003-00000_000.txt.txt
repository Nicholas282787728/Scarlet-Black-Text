NNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Pioneers Take

In Opening Baskel‘ball Game
! New Rules Affec‘l

The Pioneer cagers opened
their home season with a Vice
torious bang Monday night, .as
they turned back the invading
Central college five, 59-51.

The fast breaking attack of;
the Grinnell quintet proved to he
too much for the flying DuLCh»
men. For the whole game, except
one brief moment in the first
half, our boys stayed out iii tront.
The Scarlet and Black ﬁve’s im-
pressive demonstration of team
work was an outstanding factor
in the contest Eaglereyed Earl
Peisner led the Pioneers scoring
with seven field goals and two
free throws for a total of 16‘
points. Right behind him, with 12:
points each, were-Verne Hull and’
Jack Chaft'ée. Eorgman. Central‘s‘
6-fout 8-inch center, led the
Dutchman’s scoring with fifteen
points.

By using 14 men, Coach Ben
Douglas showed that his team’s
reserves are still adequate, den
spite recent losses due to in—
juries ‘and eligibility difficulties.
Every man who saw action show—
ed that he was capable of giv~
ing his opponents a tough battle
in any game.
