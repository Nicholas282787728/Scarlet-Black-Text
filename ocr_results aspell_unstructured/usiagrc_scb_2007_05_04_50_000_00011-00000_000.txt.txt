Defending RLCs

I was disappointed to read the Start Edi»
torlal in this edition of the S5519, The savage
criticism of RLCs seemed unjustified and
lacking substance \vhilc admittedly, some
RLCs could be bcttct at doing their jobs, we
must recognize the often unseen contribution
that they make to the campus.

I think the SM? staff owes an apology to
all ofthe RLCs. I am looking forward to mﬂd’
ing some sort ofapology or clarification in the
next issue ofthc 5&8,

Sincerely,
Dew Rallﬂllﬂlﬂ/lgfliltt/J '09

Trustees care

As Griuncllians, we celebrate our critical
thinking and “fuck the man" mentality and
this, I believe, is something we X/JmI/d be proud
of 1 am ashamed, however, of our tendency
towards counter-productive modes ofcomnilr
nication with “the rnaii.”1\t the ptesentarioii
to the trustees last week, the hated subjects
of the tuition incrcase and changes in the int
ternational students financial aid policy came
up as they inevitably would. i, like any other
student, am rrnhappy with the idea of tuition
increase because, like many ofus, I am already
in debt up to my ears. I also do not savor the
idea ofrcfusing admission to anyone based on
income. I do not, however. agree with the tactic
that nicinbcrs of our student body have been
taking in addressing their concerns about the
tuition increase to the trustees. Here is a news
ﬂash 7 the trustees are human. the trustees
know that it will be hard for people to pay the
increased mition, the trustees know that there
is a possibility that middleeclass students will
suffer under the increase, and THEY CARE,
When the trustees met in February, the open
forum took the form of an informational talk
by our Dean ofAdil-iissions and Financial Aid,
Jim Sumner, on the new tuition and finan—
cial aid policy wrth questions and discussion
among students and trustees at the and Far
fewer students showed up at this event than
at other open forums including the one last
week I would like to call on all Grinncllians
to utrliec these opcn forums to talk with the
trustees but also to be respectful and construct
live in our conversations with themTheic is
no good done by putting the trustees- on the
defensive. i believe that by being nice to “the
man" we stand a better chance at getting “the
man" to do what we want.

Sexist student

Last Saturday's Titlilar l-Icacl festival was
a chilling reminder of the progress we have
not made in the status ofwornen. Among a
slew of obscenities that drunken classmates
screamed, om: male Grinncllran stood up and
truly shocked me. He yelled at female Master
of Ceremonies, Liz Ward, ’07, “Take off your
clothesl" Leftist men shouted the same thing
at Marilyn Webb in was when she spoke
against .cv sin at in AntirVictnam Wai rally
in Dc. fulcgcdly progressive men stood up
and yelled for Webb's husband to “take hcl off
the stage and fuck licrl” It appears that now,
as then, a woman cannot speak in front of a
group ofpeople without being an object ofset.
It even one man at this progressive institution
cannot look ot a female without seeing beyond
her tits and ass, truly, how far have we come?

Thanks, students

I’d like to thank our community supporters
in Grinnell, including seven Grinnell College
volunteers, two community volunteers, and
rcprescntativcs ofwelis Fargo Bank for their
effort in making out free tav preparation serr
vrces a success.

The volunteer tax preparers included
Grinncll College students (Kyle Perry, Allie
son Roselithal, Ari Anlsfclcl, Elizabeth Carr
ricr, Adam Biumcr, Eyob Males, and Lauren
Davis) and community members Ann Roth
and Terri l<lcmThesc volunteer tax preparers
helped 53 Powcshick County families receive a
total of884,265 in state and fedeial income tax
returns this tax season, through free tart pi‘cpm
ration sessions sponsored by Midrlowa Come
inunity Action (MICA), Iowans for Social
and Economic Developmcnt and the Internal
Revenue Service, In addition, representatives
of Wells Fargo Bank helped to- frlers open
chccking or savings accounts whcrc electronic
refunds could bc deposited and to help indie
viduals prepare for fului-c expenses,

Local families received an average of
$1,453 each in state and fcdclal tax refunds
More than halfofthc 384,265 iii refunds came
through the federal Earned Income Tat Cied’
it, or EITC, which is a refundable tax credit
for low to moderate income workcrs. Re-
search shows that EITC is the largest federal
aid program for low-income workers and lifts
more children out of poverty than any other
program. Money from the EITC has a sig»
nificant impact on families served by the free
tax preparation services, by enabling them to
pay off household debts or purchase essential
goods or services, including clothing and fur
Iiiturcc Local merchants, in turn, benefit from
these purchases.

Thanks again to all of our supporters of
the Earned Income Tax credit (EITC) project
here in Poweshiek county.

Sincerely,

Clarification

In the last edition ofthe SEW, l was quols
ed in an article about changcs in the History
Department. I know that some people had
conceins about the article, and I wanted to
clarify my comments. I stated that students
would be hesitant to take classes from new
faculty members who do not have established
reputations at Grinnell While I personally
felt the alticle was fair and do not feel that
lwas at all misreprescntcd in thc artrele, 1
would like to emphasize that I did not mean
to imply that the recently hilccl faculty in the
History Department were not qualified and
worthy of taking classes from, I was persons
ally very impiesscd by the new American Hrse
tory professor, Albert Lacson, who I think wrll
strengthen the History Department by add'lig
a new perspective and alternative course of
ings. I also thought that the one-year position
candidates that the department decided to hue
were strong. When I was interviewed for the
article, I wanted to givcvoicc to the fiustiation
that a lot of students feel when they have to
attempt to plan for a stimulating and balanced
semester with no knowledge of the teaching
style or the quantity and nature of work that
their future professor will assign, Another
concern that I personally have is that none
majors will be less likely to take zooelevel Hi .
tory courses with an unknown professor, and I
really value the presence of nonrmay‘ors in my

zoorlcvcl courses. Thatsaid, i am happy thatl
am majoiiiig in a very strong department, and
i am overall optimistic about the future ofthc
department,

History Dept.
response

I write to clarr a couple of statements
made in last Friday's article about staffing in
the History Department for next year. First,
it is inaccurate to say that “the department
will have only one returning fullr me faculty
member next year. As the“ Deans memo to
the reporter made clear, and as my memo to
off-campus majors (and sent to the reporter)
made clear, three 7 not one - ofour fiillrtime
faculty will be on staff next year: myself, Pablo
Silva, and Andrew Hsleh, Silva will be hole in
the Fall, I will be here in the Spring, Hsieh
will be here both semesters. Second, we are not
“looking to hire both temporary and tenurce
track replacelrients."\’l/e succcssfully complete
ed a tenure-track hire back in February for an
Aineiicanist to replace ProfTom Hietala.That
individuals name is Dr. Albert Lacson, and he
will be offering History 105 in the1>all -mcse
ter, as well as “Early America from the Native
Amcrlcali Peispectivc," Prof Lacson will offer
History 105 in the Spring, as well, along with
“African American History"ilnd a seminar on
“Colonial Encounters in North America."We
are “looking" only to hire temporary staff; has
deed, we have hired one: Prof. Diana Shull, a
Bil sh historian from the University ofColo~
rado. Third, Prof Purcell is not taking a “leave
of ﬂbSClICCt" She is on a scheduled sabbatical
leave, which she was able to extend to two 50*
inesters becausc she received research funding
To announce that a professor on sabbatical is
taking a "leave of absence" is as inaccurate as
saying that a student on off-campus study has
taken a personal or medical leave. These are
not petty matters; they are the way in which
a newspaper establishes itself as a reliable—or
unrcliablcﬁrecord.

As for the claim that “much of next year’s
curriculum is still in doubt," allow me to assure
rhe campus that this is not so, Ofthc 17 course
cs listed in the Fall semestel, the only three“ in
doubt" arc History 238, Germany fioin Unifi-
cation to Reunification;' History 295, Europe
During the Enlightenment, and H tory330

Religious Tolcrarion and Violence Europe,
1450-1800." We are interviewing for it Mods
crn European historian who will either teach
“Germany from Unification to Reunification”
or another modern Euiope course that is simi-
lar and will be offered in that same time slot
We will, shortly, be interviewing for a Mes
dieval/Early Modern Europc historian who
mav teach “Europe in the EnlighteninentH
the time slot listed in the couise schedule or
will teach a “Medieval" history course in that
time slor.Tllat person will also offer a seminar
in the time slot now given to “Religious Tole
eration,” Everything else in the Fall schedule
is secure, and we now know that Prof Diana
Shiill will teach History 101 in the 10:00 am,
MVVF slot listed iii the schedule and will offer
the Biitish History seminal listed for the Fall.

Looking at the courses listed in the spring
schedule, we find that only History 234, “Eur
lope in Renaissance and Reformation" a d
History 239, “Collapse of the Eurocentiic
World Order'"r e “in doubt.” Eveiyrhing elsc
listed iii the schedule is ceircct and secure.

Finally, the claim that “the couise selec-
tions [will be] a little more limited than in
picvious' years is not accurate This year, we
offered 21 courses in the Fall and 22 in the

spring. Next fall, we will offer 19 courses in
the Fall and 22' m the Spring. Its true that a
glance at the course schedule for last year and
this year would suggest we are offering 17
courses this Fall and 17 courses in the Spring,
but even that difference in number from last
year is well within the average variation in the
number of any department's course offerings
and hardly represents “limited" offerings. The
coursc schedule does not, light now, show that
we will have another section ofriistoty 101 in
the Fall and a new couisc in Modern European
history in the fallThar is because we have not
completed that hiring process. Nor does the
Course Schedule show that we will offer two
add ional Modern European history courses
in the Spring, another section of 101, two ad
ditional Modein European seminars, and an
additional ZOO-level British history course.To
that extent, some aspects of the curriculum are
unlisted, but they are not “in doubt," and our
number oflistings is not at all limited.

The Neutron
bombed

Upon first visiting Grrnnell as a prospic
over four years ago, I was ecstatic to find a
nonrtraditional institution full of ourgomg.
interesting and accepting students The aura
of Grinncll caught my attention because of
the student social scenerrdevoid of fraternities
and sorotirics, with allrcampns events open
and free to students.

Last weekend, the social scene took a turn
for the Worst: For those students who were
unaware, a private, elitist party called "Neutron
Bomb" was held in Loose Lounge, Approxi-
mately 40750 students of the highest caliber’
were invited to attend this social evening ofri-
diculonsly strong alcoholic beverages and belt
ligerent behavior.

The whole concept of an elitist party at
Griilncll is a bit troubling, especially when
those invited are deemed worthy enough to
attend by another group ofstudcn Further,
when those who attended were intoxicated
enough to get in ﬁglits,insult otliei‘s,and vome
it all over the room, one must question who
the cool people really are,

To those who chose to continue the tra-
dition of alicnating friends and students by
making Neutron Bomb a small elitist patty.
congratulations on insulting a n‘l‘tljoflh’ of the
student body, making fools of yourselves and
sending us back to high school.

Hypocrisy
here at home

Although the example of someone who
complains about the plight of people walks
ing for next to nothing in a sweatshop over-
seas while wearing no less than three items
that weie stitched by a Indoncsi i boy for ﬁve
cents all hour is certainlv a good one, there IS
a far greater cvrmple of hypocrisy on campus
lfyou arc going to point out the cruelty ofco»
lonial power-s who enforce their will unjustly
on a population that was there far before they
were, don’t turn around the next second and
talk about how we have to transform the City
of Grinncll into the bohemian paradise that
better so s your aesthetics This is another
case at the immediately funny but deeply trou-
hllng phenomenon of those who claim that
they have the right to their own beliefs, opin-
ion, and culture, but who don't feel the need to
extend to others the same courtesy.
