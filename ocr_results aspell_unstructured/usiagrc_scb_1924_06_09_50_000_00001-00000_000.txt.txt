The first regular collage Glee club
was formed in 1394. The personnel
at this Organization included: F. E.

It was organized by Rosseler G. Cole,
who now conducts a scliDDl of music
in Chicago. Mr. Cole led the Club
until 1901.

The directorship was then assumed
by Dudley L. Smith, who held that
posmou until 1907. when George L.
Pierce became the new head. “Dave"
Peck has been the guiding star of the
club since 1910; and it is due to his
single ability and untiring efforts that
the club is the outstadding organiza-
tian that it is today.

During its entire history the policy
of the club has remained unchanged,
and it has worked as a pioneer club
in setting 2!. higher musical standard in
the middle west. The work at the
club in the Chicago and New York
Contests shows the exceptional re—
sults of this policy.

Scribe Reviews Joys

and Sorrows of Year

i

\V‘e't‘e had our last exams, which us-
ually means that the year‘s courses
are finished. This, of course, de-
pends somewhat on the outcome of the
exams. There is a great deal of pound-
ing, knocking, and so forth, and it
looks as if the joyous (7) school days
are about over. i

All in all, it has been one
good year.

Whenever our classes have
been kind enough not to interfere, we-
‘ve spent the time profitably in ac<
rluiring knowledge, useful and non-
useful varieties.

We've added another layer of so-
phistication to ollr undergraduate
makecllp; we've learned how to sleep
in the Lille, and how to dust off the
Music hall steps. we more,than 391
have died as result of food eaten at
spreads and lblankeq picnics, and 3
have lost their minds from. over work.

Besides, we've met the “one and
only" this year, and as we wander
around milking our last farewells to
every familiar spot, the most unkind-
est cut of all is that three long mon-
ths stretch lonesomely between now

Triumph as Temperamentnl
“Lisa. Della. Robbin.”

Fortune smiled on the Senior class
Saturday night when “Enter Madame"
established itself as an outstanding
production of the Grinnell dmmatic
season. Senior plays have been, as it
rule, makeshl:t productions, concocted
hurriedly and presented with attendr
ant Carelesshess.

"Enter Madame" could not be any
sifted thus. The setting was adequate,
the lighting all that it should be, The
actors performed their duties in a joy-
oils and efﬁcient way.

Honors Go to “0111115011.

The evening properly belongs to
Wilma Thompson. Her Delia. Robbin
was a fortunate characterization. To
watch her moments of intensity, hel-
subtle nuauces, her exquisite poise,
was sufficient pleasure for any critic.

Miss Thompson does not imitate the
students of dramatic academies. l-ler
interpretations have in them that which
is spontaneous and natural. She never
struggles for an effect, She is too
good an actress for that, Instead she
gives a sincere portrayal, an accurate
and imaginative delineation of her
character.

The supporting cast was capable in
cach instance. Basil Talbott enacted
a difficult role in a manner that merits
approbation. He combines the duali-
tics of an able forceur with the intel-
ligent methods of a careful artist. We
found him thoughtful, deft, and thor-
oughly convincing.

Minor Ports Well Played. >

The domestics ably impersonaterl by
Gilbert Pulleu, Kenneth stock and
Florence Craver were consistently
good. Marvin Smith and Eloise
Loomis mastered the linguistic diffi-
culty of their parts. Louise Moylc
was an artful widow. John Tnibott
and Lucile Hiudorfl contributed two of
the finest juvenile characterizations
that we have ever observed. They
combined haturalness, and charm to a
superlative degree.

M . chuy-Cotc pushed his actors to
the limit of their ability. The play
resembled "The Belmont Handicap" in
respect to tempt). There was not a
dull moment or a forgotten line.

.anlng spoken favorably in many
rcspects it remains our solemn duty to
inquire why so many charactcrs were
required to prance around the center
table. We feared that Miss Moylc

than they have for several years.

Coach Hyland is well, qualified to
coach Pioneer football teams, and his
appointment was a popular one with
both the alumni and student body.
in his years of coaching at Highland
Park, and the old Leander Clark col—
lcges, he achieved almost sensational
success in spite of the fact that he
had little material with which bi
work,

His playing experience comes from
Iowa university, where he was an all
around star- in football, basketball, and
baseball, and one of the best ends ever
turned out at the Huwkeye school.
Futilermore, Hyland will' be remem-
bered by Grinneii followers as the
man who was largely responsible for
the comeback that the.team staged
after the unfortunate game with
Drake last fall.

Black Is K. U. Star

in "Charlie" Black, Hyland will
have an assistant or no mean ability,
This will be his first year of coach
ing but Grinnell fans who have seen
Black control the championship Kalb
sas quintet on the floor, have no
doubt of his ability to turn out a good
team. For two years Black has been
an'unanimous choice for ail-valley
guard on all star teams. In addition
Black was a star end and backfield
man in football; and will be bit/elk
field coach and Hyland's assistant
next fall. \

With thirteen lettcrmen and a large
number of star freshman football men.
Hyland and Black will not lack
material with which to work. Captain

and C. Kingery, are the backfield let—

men in the line. In addition there is

and Peterson, Holdridge, Peterson.

that for football, Eenz and Cushman

Gelviu will be a worthy captain, for
besides being an crcellent forward
