Freshman Class Party.

on an evening resplendent with
the gifts of a perfect moon, the
class of 1904 gathered in the so-
ciety halls for the purpose of
spending a social evening and be-
coming better acquainted. As
the members entered the recep»

the evening’s entertainment were
distributed. It was explained that
each person should ﬁnd a differ»
ent partner for the seperate num-
bers of the program. By this
unique arrangement. all were en-
abled to become acquainted.
Afteragrand march the members
engaged in various amusements,
such as guessing the original of
proﬁles, having their fortunes
told. singing. and other entertain-
ing events. Throughout the
evening, the Misses Andrews and
Persons most graciously presided
over the trappc bowl, thus adding
much to the comfortofthe merry-
makers. Late in the evening
light refreshments of frappe and
cake were served. Several juniors
added to the evening's pleasantry
by their presence. The Misses
Millard and Haines, and Professor
Boodin. acted as chaperons. The
company departed at a late houri
feeling that their Friday evening
had been well spent.
Oratorlcal Association,

At the annual oratorical contest
last spring a proposition was made
that Iowa College withdraw from
the state oratorical association.
That measure was defeated.

Since that time a change in our
debating league has taken place,
our opportunities tor debate have
been broadened. But we must not
forget that our connections with
the Oratorical Association of the
state will still hold.

It would be far better to with-
draw from this association at once

tion room, printed programs of-

 

and forever, than to compete in
any halt»hearted way.

The home contest will‘be held
immediately before the holidays.
A meeting of our association is
called for next Monday evening
and at that meeting the question
of allowing tlirce prizes. a ﬁrst of
515.00 and a third of 55.00 in ad-
dition to the customary Slooo as
second prize, will be brought be-
fore the association.

Grinnell is not a fourth or ﬁfth
grade college. Can we. as students
of Grinnell, content ourselves with
third. fourth or ﬁfth rank at the
contest next February? To have
a representative who will do us
justice we must have a good rous-
ing home contest. it we can ac-
cept the testimony of those who
have taken part in these yearly
contests. “it pays.” The training
received will repay any ordinary
student for the effort. If a num-
ber will put forth their best efforts
to win in the home contest, the
competition will be close and the
right representativewillbe chosen.
We are conﬁdent we have the ma-
terial, Let that everepotent “Grin-
nell spirit" carry us to victory in
the state contest next February.

Princeton has adopted a new
course for training in debate,
The course will occupy a [was
hour session, weekly, during the
ﬁrst term, and will count as a twee
hour elective. The course in den
bate will be under the direction
of the department of Politics,

History, Economics and Oratory.

Michigan will give a new course
in marine engineering this year.
