GCGC: support, not activism

: The Grinnell College Gay Communi~
_ y (GCGC) is an organization of ap-
proximately 25 individuals which
stresses inlercommunication rather
than political activism.

Founded sometime in the early
19705, the organization describes ltseli
as a flexable support group for gays
who are out of the closet or wish to
emerge. Further, the GCGC “ol'l‘ers a
sense or community and support" for
these persons,

lilm, The Ritz, through SGA money.
From these funds, the GCGC has also
purchased subscriptions to magazines
and bought books, which can be lound
in Burling Library.

An interesting aspect oi the GCGC is-
that not everybody who attends the
meetings is gay. As one group
member commented, “Some are peo-
ple who are open to what’s going on or
are interested in things we discuss.”

While some homosexuals would

 

An interesting aspect of the GCGC

is that not everyone

who attends the meeting is gay.

 

The GCGC is divided into two
groups, according to sex, This division
is necessary due to the different needs
of men and women, However, the
men‘s and women's groups gather
together once a month to discuss the
activity ol the group as a whole.

Because the GCGC is more concerns
ed with social interaction than
political activity, it concentrates on
'the former, However. the group does
have a political link with the Gay
Alliance of Iowa. it also has ties with
various other gay communities in the
state,

Members [eel political actiVlty has
been varied during the last few years.
Most view oils year optimistically,
due to an increase in the number of
people in the gay community who are
more open and accepting of their sex»
uality.

As in previous years, the organiza-
ticln hopes to obtain SGA money for
relevant campus events. Last year.

come out of the closet regardless of
the GCGC’s existence, GCGC
members believe the organization
makes the process easier because it
offers a source of communication and
support for gays. Within this group,
members have no pretenses and are
able to relax and discuss what is on
their minds with people who are com-
l'ortable belng gay.

The evidence at previous years
leads one member to belleve that “if
there Was no official GCGC, we would
still support each other."

The organization invites interested
person to attend meetings. For in
dividuals who have questions about
the topic or homosexuality, the group
is open to questions and Visitors.

Meetings of both groups are weekly
The women's support group gathers
Tuesday nights at 3:30 pm. at l405'/2
Park St (upstairs). The men’s group
meets Wednesday nights at 3:00 pm,
at 824 5th Ave (upstairs).

Separating ga

While Grinnell College is conside-
a haven for liberal thinking, only a
lcw homosexuals have felt comforr
table enough to come into the open
about their preference. Those that
have emerged offer some insights i
the attitudes and concerns of gay p
pie. I ‘ ' :

According to a recentlypublished
study by Masters and Johnson, at
least 10 percentpf the total US. _
populationare exclusively homose i
Hal.

At Grinnell, only about 25 people
have openly proclaimed their - ,
homosexuality. A female member 0
the Grinnell College Gay Communit
(GCGC) group said many individua
don't come Dut'until later on in thei
lives because they are less likely to
encounter peer pressure, and more
able to deal with their sexuality,

In general, yarious degrees of ga
emergence are evident. A few in»
dividuals come out completely, whil
a substantial number never emerge
Many persons emerge between the
two extremes. Howard Reisner of th
GCGC believes the individual must
ask which is going to be easierAsati
tying society or him/herself.

Besides the many social barriers,
most gays are continually bombard
by stereotypes suggesting such sen»
timents as: “Homosexuals live, eat,
and breathe sex;" “Men are women
haters and women are men-haters;"
“Homosexuals molest children;" an
“Every gay man or woman is willin
to jump into bed with anything that
faintly resembles a member of their
own sex.” _

Reisnerdescribes the most comm-
gay image‘as that of the elfeminate
male. He says the majority of gay
,males are not effeminate. Women, ti
suiler from the stereotype of the
“butch dyke,“ or “macho” woman.

Dealing wit

Much of society is less tolerant tha
lege toward gay lifestyles.

“You have to choose where you're
one woman said, “That’s why there .
clusters.” Howard Reisner feels that
there is support and Grinnell College
are professional considerations, only
present state of society." As another
points out, “This school is small. My
that due to one's identification as gay
would shy away from him.” For this
ed Bob Dorsett, some homosexuals w
the closet and avoid labeling and neg.
stereotypes,

. One aspect DI the attitudes of societ,
number or gays must coniront is the a
certificates. Reisner said persons can
