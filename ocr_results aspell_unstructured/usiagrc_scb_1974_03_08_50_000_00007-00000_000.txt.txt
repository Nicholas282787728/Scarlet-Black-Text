(Ed. Note: Last week’s article in
this series on the college health
services looked at things from a
student point of view, Part 3 ex-
plores the attitudes and opinions
of the Health Center personnel, se—
veral town doctors and two mem-
bers oi the Sex Education Commit-
tee. The iinal article will examine
the suggested recommendations
made by the ad hoc Committee to
Investigate the Health Center.)

, by Louise Dix
Just as students have been expres-
sing a variety of oplnions about the
Health Center, the Health Center
personnel, several doctors andsex—
ual education committee members
have also thought about the present
health services and raising their
own questions.
The need {or a doctor stationed in
‘the Health.,Center seems to be a
‘ major consideration of many stu-

dents on campus. According tolrma~

nan, Health Center supervisor,
"I’m not against having a doctor
here. I think it would be great. It
would take the responsibility off
our shoulders." But she said there
are several things to consider ecoe
nomically and realisticady.

Complications
“Could we promise a doctor a
stimulating enough practice to be
.‘here everyday?” she asked, “Six
sore throats in two hours. What
kind of doctor would be Satisﬁed
‘ with this?” She said that the big-
gest complaint or a doctor in the
Health Center would be a lack of
interest. Marie Durr, a R.N. at the
Center, agreed with this. “A doctor
wouldn’t find it very challenging
here,” she remarked. College stu»
dents are "pretty healthy” and are
one or “the most healthy age
.groups.”

Grace Cameron, 3 student nurse
aid who has been on the staff for
three years added, "No doctor is
just going to sit around and hand
out cold pills and medicines. He’d
have to learn how to knit." Maura
Zwerling, another student aid who
has worked there about two semeSr
ters commented, “Practically spear
king, we certainly don’t need a full-
time doctor. I’m not even sure we
need a part time one. There’s just

ot enough problems. You don’t go
to a doctor for a cold. Maybe more
would come to the Health Center
if there Was a doctor, but I don’t
think 50.”

Too Healthy

Cheryl Pickard, another student
aid who’s worked there two years
agreed, “I don't think college stu»
dents would generate enough busi—
ness for lull time." Dr. J.C. De-
Meulenaere, a town doctor, said
, that there just isn't enough “health

‘care work to require the services
of a full time doctor." The college
couldn’t afford one, he said.

Hall said that if the Health Center
were to hire a doctor, it would
probably have to be an almost res
tired doctor, one with a health pro»
blem or a young doctor just out oi
internship due to the nature of the
position. Dr. D.L. Ferguson, town
doctor and college medical advis-
‘r, also commented on the type
‘oi doctor the Health Center would
attract.

“A young doctor won’t be satis~
tied with basically healthy people
aged ill-22. He would want the
stimulus or more serious ill-
nesses.” The doctor would probe
ably be "one who needs to slow
down; needs a lighter load. There’s
only about an hour or two a dayload

.2 Grinnell," Ferguson stated.

Persona'lit
The personality of the doctor is

another consideration. Hall said,
“We’d need a doctor with good med-
ical judgment and a personality to
please everyone. How could wepre-
tend to satisfy everyone." Karen
Davis, 3 RN. at the center, said,
“By using the doctors in town and
ad hospital, the kids have a Choice

rsonality—wise, One doctor would
confine it some.” Durr agreed.
“There are six doctors to choose
{rum in town and not everyone is
satisfied. How can they be satisfi-
ed with one doctor?" Shirley Maths
is, another RlN. said that the doc-
tors in town ”all have good pre»
ﬁxation. The thing that varies most
is personality. one personality will

please one person, but another wo—
uldn't be caught dead going to that
doctor. According to Pickard, “the
problem would be to iihd one doc-
tor with the personality to fit the
personalities at 1200 students and
100 faculty, The match-up would be
terribly hard.”

Dr: Ferguson has had someexper-
ience with college-furnished lull—
time doctors from talking with his
patients who go to other schools
where a doctor is provided. "In
general,” he said, ”dissatisfaction
can run pretty high with the doctor.
Students usually end up going down
town or coming home. ln the long
run students wouldn’t be happier.
They’d get more immediate expert
attention from a doctor than the
nurses Could give. It’d be handier.
But talking in generalities from my
patients irom other colleges, they
seem to feel health center doctors
are old klutzes that just don‘t know
-what’s going on.”

Increased Fees

Another more practical consider»
anion is money. "None of usdoclors
would be unhappy with another doc»
tor,” reguson said. “Health tees
would have to go upior the students."
He said that some students would
come out ahead financially by make
ing irequent Visits to the doctor but
others, who do not go as much,
would lose money.,l>lus the consie

$20,000to $30,000 a year minimum.

Davis added that having a doctor
would be a "waste oi money." She
said that the “whole atmosphereand
approach” would have to be changed
to nccomodate n doctor's practice.
”We don’t have the equipment tor
intensive care," she said and pat»
iean would still have to he sent
downtown ior prescriptions.

The doctors in town are more than
competent enough to handle it, acc~
Drdiug to Mathis. “Grillnell’spretty
lucky," Durr remarked. “I think
they're all pretty fine doctors.” She
has worked with many doctors as
a member oi the Anny NursesCorp
in Japan and Vietnam and as a
nurse in Mexico and in a Chicago
Clinic. ”But there’s deﬁnitelyaneed
for another GP in town. These doc»

tors really work too hard," she said.
The three doctors interviewed a—

greed with that comment. Dr. rere
guson stated, "We work too hard.
We’re overpaid but it’s because we
work so hard. Grinnell Could use
another doctor. There’s noargument
from a medical standpoint that we
need more doctors.”

Dr. DeMeulenaere sald, “With the
ecu-operation or doctors in town, we
can provide adequate health care.
But there isa need for anotherdoctor
in town. All oi us are getting lazy,"
he joked. Dr. H.R. Light said that
the doctors in town are trying to
recruit a new doctor because all

\

of them are overworked. “I average
about on patients a day,” he said.
Dennis Haas, College chaplin anda
member oi the sex~ed committee
said, ”We’re lortunate in having
the number or doctors in town we
do who are open to college students
but they’re very, very busy and
sometimes can’t give the time and
attention we need here at the col-
lege.”

Assistant

Maybe another doctor in town would
help things lroni the college stand-
point as well as the town’s. Dr.
Light said, “It wouldn’t be bad to
have something else, but you don't
need a doctor." He suggested that
the college get a physician’s assis—
tant which would only cost about
$12,000 a year. “It’s a four to five
year program they just started.
About 12 a year graduate from the
University 0t Iowa. They can sew
up lacerations and do other things
that a regular RN can't.” However,‘
he said that they aren’t doctors so
they aren’t able to dole out prese
cription medicines.

Another concern of several people
on campus was the question otwhe
ether the Health Centerreallyneeds
to have four Registered Nurses and
wouldn’t Licenses Practical Nurses
do the job just as well. Accordingto
Ferguson, the differencebetween the
two is a dilierenceintraining;anRN
has three plus years and an LPN

. Scarlet Ind mick photo by bout this“
has only one year oi practicaltrain»
ing in a hospital.

Doubts

The doctors interviewed expressed
varying opinions on this subject. Dr.
Light said, “As far as I’m con
cerned, an LPN can do just about
anything an RN can do. Maybe not
right at iirst, but alter a couple
months, I'm sure that an LPN could
handle the majority of cases that
Come to your Health Center,” He
added that it would be advisable to
have an RN on duty with the LPN.
Dr. DeMeulenaere said that an RN
should be in charge but that the
auxiliary help could be assumed
by an LPN.

Dr. Ferguson said he’d be resise
tant to let a LPN work by hersell
at the Health Center. He took a
hypothetical situation of there being
a student with appendicitus and the
LPN thinking that it was less ser-
ions and keeping the student there.
That would create problems, he
said. “The more training a nurse
has in student health the better, in
my opinion,” he said. A RN is
there just to provide Z4rh0ur cov-
erage. A LPN would have to Call an
RN to check the diagnosis. “It's
just easier to have a RN or a
doctor.”

Along with the need for a doctor
at the Health Center, the need for
a gynecologist at the Health Center
or at least in the town or Grinnell

itsell is a major concern to many
studenB

According to Hall, a gynecologist
operating at the Health Center would
be “an excellent idea" but she
doesn’t know "how busy we could
keep him or her.”

Also, there is the problem of set-
ting a gynecologist up in the Health
Center. It would require architec-
tural changes of the rooms as well
as equipping these rooms with the
proper equipment according to Hall.
“There must be something {or a
gynecologist to work with, but in
essence it’s a great idea," Hall
remarked. Davis added, "I Could
see‘ the college using a GYN but
there is the expense to consider;
not the fee for the doctor so much
as for the proper equipment.” Mat»
his stated that the problems and ex?
pense of setting up gynecologist
in the Health Center are just too
much.

Low Business _

Zwerling said that she personally
would like a gynecologist. ”But may-
be there's not enough business to
justify a GYN. One hundred 3 Sem-
ester is not enough to justily a
gynecologist when she could have
100 a week somewhere else. ldon’t
think it's worth the college's while
to pay tor a gynecologist tor the
student. Not all of them will go;
maybe hall of them would."

All of the people interviewed seem-
ed to feel that although a gynecolo-

'gist in the Health Center would be

a good idea, it just wasn’t finan-
ciallyifeasible tor the gynecologist
or for the college. There was more
tavorable response to getting agyn-
ecologist {orthetown,butthere were
practical considerations to this as
well.

Top priority

Hall said that now Grinnell has its
general surgeons, ”a gynecologist
is number one on the list of spec—
ialists needed in the community."
But again she asks it the gynecolo-
gist can be guaranteed a good in»
come. “Grinnell doesn’t have much
to offer a gynecologist you must
admi ,” she said. She added that
there isn’t much the nurses or
the students can do to get a gyn-
ecologist to come to Grinnell. It‘s
really up to the doctors. Davis stat-
ed, “It would be nice to have a gyn—
ecologist in town. Most womenwould
like to have someone around who
deals just with them."

Dr. DeMeulenaere said, ”There's
just not that many gynecological
problems in a 1200 student bodyto
require a gynecologist. Besides, a
general practitioner (one who’s a
realist and knows whento referpeor
pie), can handle mostofthe problems
as well as a specialist can. It‘s
Cheaper too."

Ferguson agreed wlththis. He said,
“I can handle eiiectively 95% ot' the
gynecological problems I receive,
including infections and breast and
pelvic exams. The only things I do
not treat include such thingsas mal»
ignancies, and surgical repairs,
These cases where i need a gyn—
ecologist aren't too frequent." He
said he makes most oi his refer-
als to the two general surgeons
in town. “They are experts in sur-
gery and probably are better at
gynecological surgery than a gynr
ecologist just because a gynecolo-
gist does basically the same things
I do _- exams, diagnoses of infec-
tions, etc.”

Ferguson stated that a large part
oi his practice is gynecological in
nature. A lot of people come to
him for birth Control and about the
same amount tor gynecologicalpro»
blems. He said he also sees “a
certain amount or men concerning
venereal disease.” He does 15-20
pelVlc exams at day and charges
around is tor a basic oilice visit
and around $8 if accompanied by
a breast and pelvic exam.

As for birth control, he Said he
charges more the lirsttime because
the nurse takes thehistoryandthere
are routine exams to do. “Essene
tially it’s what a gynecologist would
do and it’s cheaper than from where
most students come from.”

Although Ferguson said he ieeis
the doctor's in town can handle stu—
dent gynecological problems, he
said, ”None of the doctors in town
would be upset” about having a

gynecologist at the Health Center.
He said the only thing they wouldn’t
like would be a part time gynecolo-
gist who would come in once a week
and is not ”around to follow up.”

"Our main problem is overwork»
what we don’t like to see is some»
one at two in the morning that some
other doctor has treatedand manag-
ed or maybe mismanaged.” Headded
that he doesn't mind it so much
if it's his patient and someone
”who trusts me during the day."
But he doesn’t like to treat some~
one who goes to someone else first.

Diane Ruyiielaere, Assistant Dean
of Student Affairs and member of
the sex-ed committee, said, “1 st-
rongly think there should be a gyn-
ecologist ln town who could maybe
come to the college once or twice
a week, Women have a lot at per-
sonal needs to be attended too. It's
hard for them to go down toadoctor
in town they don’t know and who,
though he does have some know-
ledge of gynecology, is not a gyn~
ecologist. l think getting 8 gyne-
cologist to come here would be
hard. I wish we could just magi~
cally induce some gynecologist to
come to Grinnell.”

Dr. Ferguson said that if ”some—
one wanted to come I think he or
she would do alright.” He said ano-
ther surgeon is not needed but
that “every doctor in town would
be happy to give up their obsl~
etrlcs practice to a ClB/GYN.”

Prelers GP’S

Ferguson admitted that he much
prelerred GP's over specialists,
"The iamily practitioner is more
tuned in to the whole system. A
specialist might overlooksomething
Outside his field but the GP can
get the total picture.” He said that
he felt that the college student’s
requests for a gynecologist are
due to “regional differences." Many
of the students are from the east
where specialists are used a lot
more than in the midwest where the
' GP predominates. He'd prelermore
GP’s in town than a gynecologist.

Several alternatives to having a
gynecologist at the college or in
the town were suggested. Dr. Light
suggested that the college usePlan-
ned Parenthood in Des Moines. It’s
stalled by practicing gynecologists
from the city who donate an hour or
so of their time every month. “It’s
a lot easier and a lot cheapet‘than
getting a gynecologistinlo the Health
Center even on a once-a-week
basis." He added thatGrinhell would
have a hard time getting a gyne»
cologist. “There’s too much prac-
tice tor one and not enough for
two.”

Dr. DeMeulenaere said that there
is a “ready availability oigyneco-
logical services in Des Moines and
Iowa City and that’s no farther
than people from the suburbs go
to the city to see a doctor. Grinneli
is ideally located." ,

Durr said that maybe something
could be worked out with a gyne-
cologist in Marshalltown, Iowa City
or Des Moines. She suggested may-
be having a doctor open up an hour
of his time a week to Grinnell stu-
dents. “We’d have to make sure the
doctor is paid evenifnoonesbows,"
she said. She added that this would
have to be worked out with the ad-
ministration. “They have the in-
nds,” Haas suggested working out
some arrangement where a gyne-
cologist would come once a week to
the Health Center.

other suggestions included maybe
getting carpools or buses (like the
library shuttle) to go to gynecolo-
gists in Marshalltown, Des Moines
or Iowa City once a week. The
Health Center would set up the
appointments and carpools would be
arranged through the college. Per—
haps something could be worked out
on a similar basis with Planned
Parenthood, the University of lo-
wa's health service or the Emma
Goldmann Clinic in Iowa City.

Haas said he thinks Something could
be worked outwith the clinic. One
of the persons who started it was
a Grinnell College graduate. The
clinic provides birth control and
abortion services, women’s clinic
sell-help Clinci, and alternate psy-
chotherapy. Haas has referred sev»
eral people there and has had “a
