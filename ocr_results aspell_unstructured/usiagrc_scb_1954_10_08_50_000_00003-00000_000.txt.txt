- SUCCESS STORY. . .

AND HOW IT STARTED...

ADMIRAL BEDCKMAN says: “I prepped
i at Baltimore Polytech, found I liked
math and electrical engineering —
nquireii subjects for a Navy career.
But it was gelling licked in lacrosse
by the Navy pieiies that got me
interested in Annapolis. My break on
an appointment came when two
ahead of me failed
on exams. I worked
hard to graduate,
got into sub class,
did some teaching,
eventually earned my
own sub command!“
