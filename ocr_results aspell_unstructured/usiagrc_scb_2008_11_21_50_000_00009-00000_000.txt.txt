ArtIst embraces new medIums in work

Kirsten Aho ’08 to open unique, interactive show in Off-campus apartment

3v BassIL ALCIIEIKII

Much art, in galleries or othemise.ju5t sits there. You look
at it, you comment on it, and you forget it like any number of
the objects you only see on a given day, One unique artist at
GIIIIneII, Kiri Mo '03, deﬁed this model by creating unique
InthIcIive III betoIc she gIIduIch Ind continues to do so on
the ninth semester Art Fellowship, 3 unique opportunity {oI
art majors to get paid by the College to complete work for one
extra semestel.Tonight, all are invited to an unorthodox venue
(an offrcampus apartment at 923 1/2 Broad Street) to both look
at and experience the deﬁnitely unorthodox art that she has
completed in these last three months,

Aho’s art features a wide Variety ofmcdia. including abstract
paintings, ImmIl sculptures, and stuffed animals Animals are
I consistent and important thcnIc III her work. According to
Aho, she uses animals in much ofher III simply Is I means to
create an innocent connection that the audience uses to cxpeii-
ence the other objects and paintings InoIe fully. “Animals are

something everyone can connect to," she said,

An interactive quality is perhaps the most distinctive aspect
orAIIo's work. One can even wear some oftlIe art piecesi just
mention the “slug glove" or “cocoon", and you're in for a great
demonstIItIoII or art pieces one could wear

Aho's philosophy behind the IIt she makes is that the art is
meant for humans to participate in, rather than simply observe.
“People need to know that it isn‘t about the objects or paintings
it's about human Interaction with the objects,” she said

The venue in which Aho is showing her an mItches up
with the uanue insights and motivations that she puts into It.
The absrmctness of many of her onIts, and their multiplicity
of meanings, lends them the ability to create extremely per
sonal connections in their audience. The stctile gallery setting
might make these connections hardei to cultivate, so Aho asked
{mild (and S811? columnist) Harsha Sekai ’08 it’she could use
his apartment.

Sekar rcIIdily agreed, though he saw the apartment venue

as fulﬁlling a dIfferent purpose. “In the Cold War, Eastern Eu-
ropean Communist governments prevented many artists from
publicly displaying abstract pieces, claiming that the pieces of
art were ‘subversive'." he said. "Abstract artists would hold EXT
hibits and displays in their own private apartments and inIIte
rIIends and family to observe their masterpieces . ever since.
It has been I tradition in parts ofthe aIt communities to hold
shows in apartments."

Aho’s art Isn’t much for traditioniit's often more about
breaking lt’ but it's deﬁnitely all about community, and so
the opening tonight should be a funtﬁlled event, It will already
be filled with the ﬁery passion orthe creative act, and Aho Irir
t IpItcs burning with moIe than just passion betoIe the end or
the night.

In reference to one unique piece in her show she said, “Well,
I'm going to attach It to this horse and then burn it.“

The menace of empty white wall syndrome

York /09 asks students to attempt more creative appropriations of their surroundings

There Is I disturbing lack of grafﬁti on
this campus. Seriously. It‘s getting to be a real
pIoblem for I number otrsasons.

A lot or students come from bigger sites
than Gtinnell, And I'd venture to guess that
the bare brick walls, sidewalks and windows
that surround us are one of the most underrat-
ed sources ofﬁrsbyear culruIe shockThere’s
something sterile and uninhabited about blank
walls that puts one ill at cIse,

Over the years,I (and plentyorothcrs) have
become acclimated to what I term EVVVVS
(empty whitc wIll syndIonII). Acclimation Is,
however, no excuse for complacency.

This week’s column is devoted to gIIaIII.
OI, more broadly, how to givc a little bit of
yourselfto the area that you inhabit.

In Grinn ll. there are places on campus
wIIcIc grafﬁti s permIttetI and even encour
agch Take one step into Bob's Underground
Cafe and you're surmunded by years or sruI
dents’ creative outbursts. The trains that cut
through cIIIIpus everyday aIc often peppercd
with spray paint.. a.ntl Butling bathrooms are
notoiious for getting tan gcd up

But prc allocating spaces for deraccnIenr
Is about Is diculous as tlou g a beret and
listening to Chopin whiic spraypain * g

Before I alienate administrators too much
with Iny pro-graffiti stance, allow Inc to dc-
ans what I mean by giafﬁti. suIc, rhctes your

one of the boys across the sweet rrom
my house, Asa
W Ildei ‘10,
mentioned an
artist he had
seen the other
day who did
“IcveI-se gIIta-
ti" on cars. The
aitist, Scott
Wade, makes
Images by strategically cleanIng dIIt errorcaIs.
Asa had seen a rendition of Vermecr’s “Girl
with a Pearl Ba 3" on the back ofa Mini
Cooper.

I did a bit of research and stumbled across
I onIdctt’ul website: cnIIII-onmcntIIgIIrIIti.
oIg “VVelcumc to thc onld otrcycrsc grafﬁti,"
It gicetcd me, “when: the IIIIst‘s weapons are
cleInIrIg nIIItcrIIls and where the enemy Is the
elements: wind, rain, pollution and decay"

Among what were deemed the 35 Greatest
Works of ReveIsc Grafﬁti was another Scott
Wade piece: an elaborate picnire that features

iconic“stIIIry Night"swirls in the background,

become on em c anIs. Namely, taking Id-

This does not necessaiily entIIIl piopetty

your stir on dings and making them reﬂective

Another equally iIIthcerng (mm of grat-

ﬁti that I happened IcIoss on the website is
called light grafﬁti. Basically it's exactly what it
sounds like: projecting light on walls in artistic
or none shapes.

The first picture that caught my eye as I
scrolled through the Website was one of a git
gantlc bIImIn symbol proiected on I building.
The piece was done In Barcelona by an un-
known artist.

viewer.

In an even simpler fashion, large buildings
have been used to make formations by liglil’
ing up diacrent windows. This is I fantastic
example or spatial reclamation, and it looks
beautiful, too.

Then me, it seems, way for "the man,"
