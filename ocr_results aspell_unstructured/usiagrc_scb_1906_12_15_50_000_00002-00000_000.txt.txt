separated. Mr. Thompson showed a
thorough knowledge of the question
and presented an interesting argu-
ment.

W. H. McClenon closed the debate
for the afﬁrmation and showed his
abiliry as a debater by presenring an

‘extempuianeous speech dealing
largely with rebuttal points. He
dwelt on the success of municipal own-
ershi‘p in Germany and Great Britian
and claimed that the plan of the
aﬂlrmative would secure better polit-
iealrconditlons, would be more eco-
nomical and would be more satisfac-
tory in actual practice.

Charles W. Boardman closed the
debate for the nezatlva and presented
a. logical and interesting argument,
He outlined a plan under which the
city would have perfect control under
private operation and ownership. Ile
'maintalned lhat under municipal
ownership a city could nol secure con-
tinuous management, that honest. and
capable men would not enter the
city’sservice and that public :enter-
prises are exllztv'dgant and wastciul.

rn rebuttal each side showed up
well and much oi the previous argu~
ment \Vlis cleared up in the mind of
one audience. The judges for the de-
bate were J. P. Lyman, J S. McGowan
and A. 0. Lyon and they rendered a
deci on of 2 to 1 in favor of the allir-
math-e. The judges iorepeakers-io-
