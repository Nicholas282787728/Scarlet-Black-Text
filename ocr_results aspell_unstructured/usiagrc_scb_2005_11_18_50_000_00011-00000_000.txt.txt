Season ends, stupid week begins

Teams struggle at
Warburg Regionals

Bv ANDv CHoN

Both the men’s and women's cross
country teams had a disappointing per
formancc last Saturday at the NCAA
D111 Central Regional Cross Country
Championships.

Although both teams had raced
at Wartburg before, there was a lot of
pressure during the regionals, which
changed the atmosphere of rho race
and made it more difﬁcult for the runs
ners to perform at their full potential.

The men placed 10th overall, with a
team total of 263 points in the 8k race.
The women took ninth place with a (0*
tal score of268 in the 5k,

Charlie Knuth ’08 led the way for
Grinnell, finishing the 8k in 25:43
minutes, which was good enough for
35th place.

Although Knuth had a relatively
good race, it was not fast enough to
qualify for nationals.

The top three men's runners were
rounded our by Dave Honig ’06 and
David Krist Y08.

Honig took 47th place with a time
of27:12 minutes after falling back sew
cral places due to a cramp during the
third mile. Krist ’08 ﬁnished in 54th
place with a time on7:18 minutes.

The women were led by Sam Brady
'07, who ﬁnished In 44th place with a
5k time of 24:19.35 minutes.This was
Brady’s ﬁrst top finish for the Grinnell
cross country team.

Erin Booth ’07 was right on her
heels with a time of 24:19.90 minutes,
which put her in 45th place. Katie Ryan
’07 followed closely behind with a 47th
place ﬁnish time of24z21 minutes.

No runners from Grinnell's cross
country teams qualiﬁed for nationals
rhis year, which is unusual because of
Grinnell’s dominating presence in the
MWC.

Stupid week is true to name

Most returning Grinnell students are familiar
with the annual cross country “Stupid Week," which
takes place one week after the NCAA National Cross
Country Championships, It's pretty hard not to no-
tice a crowd of athletes sitting in the cafeteria wear-
ing nothing but towels from the REC, eating their
entire dinners from plastic cups.

Stupid week has come seven days early this year,
but it is as awesomely stupid as ever. Awesome and
stupid truly go hand in hand as runners participate in
events such as the No Hands Dinner at Cowles and
the Canon Milk Challenge. '

These events allow the cross country teams to
blow off a little steam after their season and it gives
the rest of the school a reason to stare,

The Pizza Hut Lunch Buffet Challenge and the
KFC Bucket run on Monday started Stupid week in
style Cross country will ﬁnish the weekend with a
soccer game against the women's soccer team on Sats
urday and the infamous Betr Mile on Sunday.

Pioneer football ends season with another difficult loss

EV KEVIN BYRNE

In the last game ofa difﬁcult season for the Grin-
nell College football team, the Pioneers fell to the viss
iting Beloit Buccaneers by a score 05577.

It was a Wet and rainy Senior Day and after the
fans and players thanked the seniors before the game,
the Pioneers had a tough time getting their offense
going and a tough time stopping the Eeloit ground
attack.

“Beloit played fast and aggressive, heating us to
the point of attack at the goal line early in the game,"
said senior offensive lineman Mike Maloney. “When
we could not score inside their five, it gave them mo-
mentum and let them take control ofthe game.”

The Grinnell defense, led by senior lincbackcr
Leo Martin and his 15 tackles on the day, gave up
581 yards of offense total, which included at 251301!“
second quarter for the Buccaneers.All but 50 ofthosc
yards came on the ground for Beloit, as their run
blocking and option offense had the Pioneers on their
heels for a better part ofrhc afternoon

On the offensive side of the football, Grinnell
starred Ben Remington ’08 at quarterback in place of
injured quarterback Sean Pfalzer '07. Remington and
the offense were unable to dcnt the scoreboard until
the fourth quarter.

"Defensively, they tried to put more men in the
box than we could block, which effectively took us out
ofour running game," said Conch]cfchdcrscn.“This
did allow us to throw [hC ball some, but with the cons
ditions itwas rough to rely on rhc pass exclusively"

Remington finished the game 19 of 41 for 211
yards and one touclidown,whiclt came on a five-yard
strike to Nick Mcrklin ‘08, Clurcncc ‘C]’ Moore '09
was Grinnclls ropsrushcr on the day wirh 211 yards on
cighr carries. Lance Burkholder ‘os ﬁnished the day
as Grinucll’t top receiver with eight receptions for 93
yards. Kyle Perry ‘08 pulled in five catches for a total
of67 yards.

scason and leaves them with a record of 179 (079
MWC), In a season riddled with injuries and full of
young players, the future clearly lies ahead for the re-
turning players.

“This year was tough, but we are very optimistic
for next year," said Pedersen, “The two keys for sucr
ccss next year will be one, recruiting a large freshman
class, and two, the returning players’ attitudes in the
off-season. if they all make a commitment to work
out hard and come back bigger and more athletic next
ycar,wc'1l he in good shape."

As for the senior class, It was certainly a difficult
note to go out on. It was a season with possibly more
bad memories than good ones.

“Well, of course I would have liked to have won
more games," said senior linebacker Franklin Gilm-
orerMetz,“but1 still had a great time and even though
we only won one game timing the season, i still have a
lot ofgood memories 1rry not to thin on thc ncgns
rivc but rather the posmve. My fellow athletes, friends
and coaches made the season good for me as much as
actually playing foothnu."
