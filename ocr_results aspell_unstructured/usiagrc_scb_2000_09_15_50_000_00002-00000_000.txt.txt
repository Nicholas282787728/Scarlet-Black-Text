Volunteer prOgram expands .

Alt. Break program expands to include weekends and summer

crs will hold training sessions once a weak in the
month or so prior to departure. While the
program's coordinators need to approve all break
and weekend trips. the planning and training are
the responsibility orthe leaders.

The entire Alternative Break process is designed
to help the volunteers get as much out orit as pos
sible. There are planned teneetion times, when
the group members can compare theii experiences
and qucstion the different aspeets or their work.
Dowd says, "This is where the trip
erosses the line between juxtwoik»
ing and being part of the rest or
your life." All the coordinators
eoiild tell stories orrhe appteeiae
tion, Fulﬁllment, and pencefulness

as an expansion or weekly pro»

Action Now has evolved into a cooperative eneom.
passing five different programs. The coordinators
hope to appeal to a diverse population ofGrinnell.
and to get 10»20% of the campus involved this
year. They also hope to work with loeal groups
and create awareness orthe many local volunteer
opportunities,

Mostly, they are urging anyone who hasn't vol»
unteered before to give it a try. “The people who
gel the most out ofit," Madriz said, “are often the
people who’ve never done it before.”
