Increasing faith

To the Niee Person in Carnegie Computer Lab.

I would like to thank you for returning my opened mail
to me lastThursday t stupidly left it in the computer lab, and
you were kind enough to put it baek in my mailbox. The card
you returned was from my older sister, and it had $40 in it for
my younger sisters birthday present. we got her singing lese
sons e something she has wanted since birth It you hadn‘t
returned the card, we couldn't have gotten her the present.
Thank you for your honesty and consideration. You have in-
creased my faith in Grinnell students.

Dress-up day

Grinnell is all about diversity and learning to aetepr other
cultures, and let’s face it, one of the most fun things about on
perieneing new eultures is tasting their food and seeing their
clothes. lSO introduees International Dress Day. Now, every
first Monday orthe month, were asking students to dress up.
And no, we don't iutt mean wearing elean elothes (though that's
definitely a great way to start). What we mean is for all stua
dents to put on their colorful, cool, national costumes so that
the whole campus can see what a Ghanaian or a Bulgarian or a
Pakistani would wear traditionally And hey, you don't need te
be an international student to jDIn in the fun. lfyou have a
costume (doesn't even have to be your national one) that you
want to show off. rein in on International Dress Day,

Evil among us?

Dear Editor,

I was very disappointed after reading last Friday's 5 on.
Nowherewirhin its pages did I ﬁnd any arriele, letter, or editoe
rial that in any way iinplieated Administrative Coordinator Jim
Dlnncrvillc in any of the myriad of downright evil plots in
which 1 ﬁrmly believe he is engaged. During my yesrs ar
Grinnell, it has beeome increasinglyobvious to me that, within
our own peaceful academic environment, we are breeding the
world's next evil genius in the person of the eurrent Adminis»
trative Coordinator. It is my beliefthat Dinnerville is the grease

est threat to our hIppy»love-child way oilift, and I trust that in.

future editions, the S éBwill kccp the Grinnell College come

Correction

To the fine peoplewho took the time to read Joe Grim reinberg's
column that appeared in the MB on the 22 of September
2000:

The final sentenee otthe tolumn should have read- "or
do we sell our souls so cheap?" but was incorrectly printed as;
"Or do we sell our soul s so (hclpLY’ The adverb in this ease
suggested that the question referred to the process ofsell llmg the
soul, rather than the price The origina meaning was that the
soul may be sold at a -eheap ptiee,- not in a ’chup wily.‘ ale
though it must be admitted that both meanings are valid and
true. The intent was to preserve the more natural and idiom»
atic adieetival form, whieh in this ease did in fact correspond to
the rules ofgrammar. More importantly, however, the adverb
that appeared in the eolumn broke the rhythm of the writing,
ending on an unstressed syllable, destroying the eadenee so care.
fully crafted in the previous 10 paragraphs and four sentences.
It is hoped that this unhappy (though understandable and
simple) mistake did not impede the errons and judgment of
the readers.

DiverSIty Initiatives

“Diversity" seems to be the new campus buzzword, it has
become a common utteranc: Within the Grinnell vernacular
and has received more attention from the administration this
tall. as exemplified by president Osgoods opening convoea.
tion, Diversity and Ambition Dialogue eeneetning diver.
sity is actively, passionately, and persistently engaged in by stu—
dents and faculty. The President has recently proposed a tee.
ulty diversity initiative, and on September 13, the Executive
Council released a modified Faculty Diversity Initiative. This
letter is an attempt to highlight some ofthe key points of the
initiative based on our own interpretations and an interview
with President Osgood on September 1 1. Also, we seek to high
light some eritieal opportuniries for student involvement. We
encourage all students to request their own copy of the Ex
ecutivc Council’s Faculty Diversity Initiative" from President’s
Osgood's once in Nollen House.

The following is a condensed summary of the points we
thought were important in the initiative.

Laundry injustice

you can see, I s‘aved the best for last.

15arah Reinhard

I didn't know what to complain about for this rant
until i started talking to Jim Hackett and Dusty Gerth,
sitting around a plate of lovely Belgian Wafﬂe Mix
pancakes at 1027 Elm Street (when I‘m low on cre-
ative inspiration, I can always count on the Slum).
Anyway, we started chatting about the injustice of
doubled laundry-chip pn‘ces Weren't they enough of
a ripcoff before? We all know Grinnellians will do any-
thing to keep their clothes clean, but this recent de-
velopment might drive students to take drastic mea-
sures. "It just gives people more of a reason to cheat,"
noted Dusty, who himself has never, ever cheated.

Lastly (and this comes straight from Emily and Ole,
tswear), why doesn't anyone dry Mac field off at 7
am. so they can go lift weights without getting their
toes wet? This one leaves little room for debate — as

‘Depattmcnml Memoranda

currently, departments seeking to add or retain a rtgular
faculty positron must submit a proposal that outlines the our,
iieular needs otthat department as well as how this position
may eonrtibiite to “all-college needs." in the (mute, it is one
couraged that departments include how such a position may
increase diversity on campus.

'Consortium for a strong Minoriry Presence (CSMP)

This is a "joint initiative designed to promote interest
among members of traditional underaepresented groups in
undergraduate liberal arts teaching." This program has note
maIIy funded two teilows per year. According to the initiative,
ifmore than two departments can sueeesstully identity desire
able CSMP fellows. additional fundingshould be provided to
support them, Also, CSMP fellows will be provided with a de.
partmenral faeulty mentor (as well as a nondepartmcntnl mcn<
tor. like all other new faculty) who will help them ndluxt to the
Grinnell community,

-Minerity ScholaraineResidcncc (MSIR)

The initiative mentions how Grinnell might want to re.

tain some MSlR eandidates into Grinnell's faculty.

-ltetenrion

In order to retain a CSMI’, MSIR, or to erente another
position within a department for faculty of eolor, a depart.
ment must make a elear case about the potential success and
contributions of the canclldnte(s).l lfthere is a desired Candl-
date ofeolor, departments are encouraged to examine curricu—
lar needs otthe department and/ortollege forthe possibility of
etearing a new taeulty position Departments should consider
the possibility ofappointing the candidate to one primary dc»
parrment, keeping in mind how such an appointment might
contribute to other departments, eontentrations. or general
eduearion es well.

This initiative possesses the parami/rl to improve faculty
diversity at Grinnell. yet, we are wholly concerned about ef.
feetiveness or this proposal in fostering diversity on campus,
First, you may have noted that our enumerations are vague
and ambiguous. This is a direct result ofa vague and ambigu—
ous initiative, secondly, there is an ereess ofresponsibiliry plaeed
on the faculty to enact this initiative successfully. Increasing
diversity needs to occur et all levels otthis institutionthitdly,
we are concerned mat there is not enough emphasis being plaeed
on the retention ofMSlR candidates. Finally, more attention
should be placed on creating interdiseiplinary positions.

As students, we uniquely contribute to Grinncll’s motlva»
tions, internal dialogue, and vision. sueh a responsibility dce

What’s (like I care) up?

What's Up? Blah blah blah That's great, talk to
you later. 15 this situation a little too hmiliar? What
is it that after the ﬁrst two weeks of school, nobody
is friendly anymore? Take this as an example. Vou're
walking down the loggia and you see someone, you
don't know very well or at all, walking toward you in
the opposite direction. You glance up at the persons
rate trying to identify the person, but not make die
rect eye Contact, You then look directly at the ground.
You think to yourself, ”Should i say hi?’I The distance
between the two of you becomes closet Your heart
begins to beat a little faster while you try to make
your decision, Vou begin to feel sweat on the brow of
your forehead You're within talking distance now -
hell, be nice- "Hi . . . 'cough" . . . um .." Ugh! why
didn't they say hi back? That's it, i hate the world.
Has this ever happened to you? Nah, me neither.
