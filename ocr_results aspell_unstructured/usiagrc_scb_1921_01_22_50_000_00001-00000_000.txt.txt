LAWRENCE, Kan, .lan. 217Grin»
Dell’s snappy. hard-fighting basket-
ball team went down to defeat before
the Kansas University five here we
night after fighting the Jayhawkers
all the way 35 to 20.

The contest was hip and tuck for
the first five minutes, the only coun-
ter being a free throw counted by
Captain Uhrlaub of the Kansans. Then
Wulf, lanky .iayhawk center, went
wild, chalking up four field goals in
a row which placed the locals in a
comfortable lead. Wulf, who was the
scoring power of the Kansas five.
was unstoppable at times, scoring al-
most at will.

The half ended with Grinnell hold-
ing the small end of a 1a to 7 count.

The Kansans also had a shade the
better of the fight in the second half.
counting 19 points to Grinnell’s 13.
They worked the hall under the bits»
ket by short, snappy passing, and
their counters were for the most part
from short range. The Pioneers, on
the other hand, resorted effectively to
long shots when the floor was clogged
under the bankboard.

Janssen, husky Grinnell guard. was
the star of the contest. He proved a
tower of strength on tl’efense, break-
ing up play after play and sending the
boil down the floor again. Fearing,
although he arrived in the game late,
Ployid a good brand of basketball, as
did Herbrechtsmeyer.

mud Fought Game

Although the score does not indi-
rate a particularly close contest, the
first half perhaps the hardest—fought
period played in the local gym this
season.

Friday Night Concert So Enjoyed
That Pierce Persuades
Musicians to Stay

The concert given by the New York
Chamber Music society at Herrick
chapel last night afforded the Grlnllell
audience what may be correctly
termed all evening of perfect music.

Variety characterized the program,
this being accomplished by the combi-
nations of eleven different instru-
menls. Only in the last number, a
group of lrish pieces by Percy Grain»
ger, were all the artists on the stage
together. The enscmble work was
marked by rare tone quality and pre-
cision. Pfeiffer‘s "Musette" for oboe.
Clarinet and bassoon, was a partic-
ularily delightful number.

This organization gives evidence of
the high musical scholarship of its
founder and director, Miss Carolyn
Beebe. Grinnell was fortunate in be‘
ing offered another opportunity to
hear them in a. different program at
the chapel this afternoon at 2:00
o'clock. Prof. G. L. Pierce, director
or the School of Music, was instru-
mental in persuading the society to
give this second concert.

Especially the quartet and quintet
numbers for oboe, bassoon. clarinet
and flute were applauded by the large
audience. "Aubad," by Whilly, "illus-
ette," by Pfeifer, and the Gavotte by
Pirani, were all characterized by their
clever harmony and tonal results Ale
though simple compared to the heavier
Spollr and Dubois numbers, they were
more enthusiastically received be
cause of their simple beauty.

Pres. Main Says Student Spirit

That the work of the students on
the campus while he was in the cast
was of incalculable value from the
standpoint of the influence it had ups
on the alumni workers and those
hearing about the college, Wits the
opinion of president Main, who was
enthusiastic about the results oh-
toined by student workers on the carn-
pus. The following statement was
made by President llain to the Scar»
let and Black upon his return yestel'r
day:

“I wish to express through the
Scarlet and Black my heartfelt slur
preciation of the work going forward
with such energy and enthusiasm
among the students in thc interest of
The Grinch Movement.

“The contributions already made arc
a splendid evidence of loyalty and flee
votion to Old Gl'illnell. They are giv-
ing enthusiasm and courage and forth
to the Alumni out in the state and In
all parts of the United States. The
work that is being done on the cam-
pus, quite aside from the pledges
made, is a contribution to the highest
ideals and purposes of Grinnell. The
urforuintiou that has come to me as

The city of crlnnell last night as-
sumed responsib ty for from $125,—
000 to $150,000 towards the college

$500,000. As soon as the town drive
is raised, it will be a dollar for dol-
lar campaign; for every dollar raised,
the General Education board will
give another dollar. until a total of a
million is reached.

President Main arrived from the
east just in time to address the meet»
ing, and he, with Mr. D. w. Norris,
publisher of the Morsholltown Times
Republican, and member of the fin-
ance committee of the Graduate Couna
oil, and Mr. H. s. McGowan, general

amount to be raised in town is to be
added to that of the faculty members
of the college, who decided that they

ed up with the town subscription. The
