IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL. IOWA, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, l898.

 

lowa College Band.

This new addition to the college
life has been hard at work Mon~
day and Thursday nights of each
week since its organization. It is
not a new departure though it may
be regarded as such by the pres.
ent student generation. In ’93
and '94 the college band was a
recognized iactoriniootballgames
and other athletic contests.

Owing to the lossesalmost nec-
essarily sustained at e.-ch com-
mencement and those due to stu-
dents dropping their college work.
it is no easy task to maintain a
college band well organized and
in good condition. even where a
band~master is employed ior that
purpose; and here, where the due
ties devolve directly upon the stun
dents themselves, the diFﬁculty is
much greater. as every three or
tour years the personnel is entire-
ly changed and new material must
Constantly worked up, which is a
very great hindrance indeed. one
tavorable circumstance regarding
the present organization is that
among its members the under
class men are in a great majority.
there being but one senior to con-,
tend witll.

The progress has been very rap-
id, taking into consideration the
fact that several of the members
were entirely new to their instrur
merits. They are iast becoming
acquainted. however, and the re
sults are very gratifying.

The music selected is that
played by the best bands, and con-
tains such numbers as “The Char-
latan,” by Sousa; “Tile Handicap”

and“EspanitaWaltzes,"by Rosey,
From present indications the band
by next spring will essentially aid
in cheering our athletic teams
both at home and abroad, which
is the principal object of organi-
zation. The instrumentation is as
follows:

The Y. M. C. A. Reception.

About twentyhve men gathers
ed in the men’s “gym" on last
Thursday evening to have a rouse
ingsocialtime. Itwasannounced
as a reception but it was entirely
different from one at those stiff
and formal affairs which we
commonly think oi as receptions.
One passing Alumni Hall about
3 o'clock last Thursday evening
would have thought regular
gymnasium work was goingon
instead oi a reception, and his
supposition would have been
correct as all sorts oi gymnastic
sports were indulged in by those
present. The ﬁrst hali hour was
spent in iriendly greetings and in
conversing about the toot ball
game and other subjects oi
common interest. Soon the
need of some morclivcly enter-
tainment wasfclt. The ﬁrst sport
indulged in was a test of strength
by pulling. There were several
entries for the contest and some
prodigious strength was shown.
Mr. Dennison won hrstplacein
the contest. The swmgmg rings,
theladderandl‘lOlizon‘ralbarsWCl‘e
used to work off some of the
surplus energy of those present.
The game of the evening was one
simular to hang-tag. This was
indulged in by every one anda
lively time was had ioru halion
hour or more. Aitei- this every
one concluded that they had had
enough exercise and enjoyment
ior one evening and the crowd
adjourned. It is hoped before
next Thanksgiving to have the
new gymnasium ready tor
Then this gathering can with
more propriety be called a
reeeptio

use.
