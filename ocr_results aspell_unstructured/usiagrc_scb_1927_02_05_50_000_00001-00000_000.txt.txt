"You Americans are the most social-
.istic people ill the world," Kenneth
Lindsay, London labor leader, told his
audience in A. R. H. auditorium
Thursday night. 'Yoll have carried sue
cialistic education farther than any
other nation, and institutions such as

- the public hospital at Iowa City, where
any one can go to get treatment free,
are unknown in England," the speaker
declared.

We ] i Widths-Ages

Mr. Lindsay said that what Amei
cans regarded as a deﬁnite “move-
ment" on the part of the labor party in
England has been going on quietly in
this country for some time. “Because
you lack a middle-ages you can escape
many or the tragedies of histori' which
have written themselves across Europe
with blood,“ said‘ the speaker. “You
do not have to allow classes to grow
up Within industry which regard each
other with suspiCiDn and lack of un-
ﬂex-standing.”

There is a labor movement in Eng-
land today, Mr. Lindsay explained, be-
cause the basic industries of the own

try are the ones which are depressed.‘

“Beer, tobscco, automobiles, and these
sort ct things, are booming, but those
industries which give 100d, clothingi
and shelter. are stagnate."
Hove Freshness
“America possesses one thing which
makes the future of your country pur—
ticularly bright," Mr. Lindsay said.
“This is a feeling that things are fresh
and new, that institutions can be
changed, that the old is not necessarily
permanent."

inquiring reporter looked suitably ini-
pi-csscd and Lindsay continued: "You
students over here lll'e treated too
much like children. You aren't given
it Chance to Work on your own 1‘5-
sponsibiliiy, or to develop any intel-
lectual interests." A member of the
esteemed Grinncll fnculty hovering in
the neighborhood hastened to disillus»
ion Lindsay by assuring him that Amy

for themselves.

Discusses lliiglish Debuting

The reporter was curious to find out
what the visitor thought about Amer-
icuii colleges as compared with 0x7
i‘ord null Cambridge. He suggested
that American debating tcauis had cut
a poor figure against the more polishr
ed oi-aioi-s [rom obi-odd. Lindsay
speukiug (mm the experience of a trip
through the United States with duo of
the curly Oxford teams, wasn't so
sure. “Naturally, no system of educa-
tion tlnit ti ins only the upper ten
per cent is at an advantage as com»
pl oil with you, who cducnte everyone.
Oxford and Cambridge nicn come from
homes where art, literature. and all
the culture oi life are part of an age
old tradition, with which they are in
contact from their earliest years, But
didn't you notice, that while those
men are clever, they know little about
their subjects and are often irrelev-
amﬂ”

liiicw Malcolm hchoiiiild

Shilling a moment. Mr. Lindsay con-
tinued. “Let me illustrate it this way ;
you American say LABoRotory. while
we in England say lztbORATORY. This
is the diiierencc between our debates
and yours. We emphasize the ore
tori, you stress the labor." Grinnell
people will be interested in learning
that Lindsay lived for three years at
or old with the three debaters who
visited uiis campus two years ago.
Malcolm McDonald, the son of the for-
mer prime minister, is a particular
friend, for whom he had only the
highest praise.

With the par-ting sally that "you are
funny people over here; you ask so
many questions," the educated labor-
itc lct himself be dragged gracefully
away by his professorial guardian,
from the clutches of interrogation-
point journalism.

Chinese Hope Is

“The hope of Chinit lies in the
south," said Prof. John D. Stoops last
night at the first meeting or the Cos-
mopolian club held this semester.
From the southern part of China a
great army of Chinese nationalists is
closing in on the northern forces or
China who are supported by foreign
powers, principally Japanese and Eng-
lish.

Professor Stoops declared that these
southern troops are tilled with a zeal
and democratic spl it which made
their armyalmostinvincible. He add-
ed, however, that there is grave dons
ger that northern generals, aided by
vast sums of money 'froni foreign
Dowel‘s, may be able to Crush the
strongly nationalistic til-my moving to»
ward the north.

In the discussion alter the talk Mr.
Fanchen Loh and Mr. T. C. Lee agreed
with Professor Stoops that the hope or
China lies in the south. Mr. Lee said
that many of the students in the northr
ern districts are leaving for the south
in order to support the armies of Can-
ton. Fanchen Lou brought out severe
ul reasons why the south should win,
but added that foreign intervention
may undo all.
