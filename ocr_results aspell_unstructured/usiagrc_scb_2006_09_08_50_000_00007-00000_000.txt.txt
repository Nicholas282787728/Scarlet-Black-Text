Triggering Town

rym RidmrdHrgo

Listen. It could be any town

from here to Muscatine. Any town
with a shoe store and a theater,

a pharmacy, pretty women.

It could be any town that’s living
off the seasons. Any town
growing grain or Corn or hell

I don‘t know the difference.

Any town too small

to have had anyone come from there.
Any town too small

for no one to have left.

Any town where George Jones rides the radio,
Where ifI talk football or crop dusting

I might ﬁt right in. Any town with an eight
dollar steak, 3 Country Kitchen.

'Any town might be the triggering town.

It might be this one. It might be miles away.
You might be fifty before you hear it;

God cocking his divine boltrThe bang.

Sneak peak at striking prints

BY MERRlCK Meyers

A dripping black ﬁgure stalks across n swamp, towering
hauntingly over a rowboar.A woman's disembodied head.
complete with bowtied plaits, ﬂoats above a line of matching
soldiers.‘These and other prints by artist Kara Walker, recently
acquired by Fanlconer Gallery, radically assert the African-
Arncrican presence in CivilWar history

The series has been on View for the past month in an inn
formal exhibition at Faulconet.The 15 blackeandewhite prints
were propped up against the walls around the gallery, ac—
companied by a note acknowledged the less than professional
presentation, but reasoned that since it was summer, “we're all
letting our hair down a bin"

The gallery has recently purchased rhe prints with funds
from the Marie—Louise and Samuel Rosenthal FundThe
series is entitled Hat-pm Pitmria/ Hir/ory 0f [/15 Civil War Mns
nomrd).17aulconsr's collection had previously included only
one piece ofart by Walker, and its directors had been hoping
for some time to acquire more of her work.

“She’s a very important contemporary African-American
woman artist,” Faulconer director Lesley Wright said, citing
"the complexity and importance ofher work in uncovering
the stories that don't get told in our standard histories."

The base images of the prints are taken from Harper!
Pr'rzrrr'rr/Hr'r/ory rfrrre Ciwil War, a publication from 1866 New
York, which contained little portrayal of the African-Ameri-.
can presenceWalker has created large, stylized silhouettes or
AfricanrArnericans, which shejuxtaposes against the original
images to suggest the untold story.

Faulconei Associate Director Dan Strong encountered the
prints at a show last year in Wilmette.When an opportunity
arose to purchase the series, the college took it, and immedi-
ately had the prints framed.

The plan is to ofﬁcially exhibit the prints in March or
April, but in the meantime, since there was extra room in the
gallery and the college had not yet decided where to store the
pictures, the directors decided to put together a temporary,
unofﬁcial “sneak pcak"cxhibit that was taken down last week.

Don’t miss intense, melancholy Rainer Maria tonight

av MICHELLE MANEMANN

Three years have passed since Rainer Ma-
ria last shook the walls of Gardner Lounge.
Tonight, the Brooklyn-based band returns to
Grinnell, promoting their latest album, CRUZ:-
mpbe Keep: Us Together.

Kyle Fischer (guitar), William Keuhn
(drums) and Cairhlin De Marrais (vocals)
have spent the last 11 years evolving from relae
tive unknowns on the Madison indie scene to

internationally respected talents.

Their eﬁ’orts have culminated in Camrzrm
p/M, despite a tedious label dispute and a bitter
intraeband breakeup. The album, their fifth re-
lease, is a tough hybrid of the haunting melee
dies fans are familiar with and a new, mature
sound that is far removed from the band’s emo
roots

Though there are noticeable changes in
the overall construction of the songs (for one,

Fischer has been permanently removed from
vocals), fans of Rainer Maria will immediately
recognize the melancholic verses and driving
emotion that have always been part of the
band's greatness, Obscure yet tragic verses
describing devotion, betrayal and recovering
love at the end of the world are ultimately
Rainer Maria’s trademark. Grinnellians who
have never heard the band should not miss
this opportunity

It’s this changed, though not remade,
Rainer Maria that is set to rock Gardner
Lounge tonight.

Driver of the Year, a local band from the
Quid Cities, is set to open, Selfedescribed as
uniting “the cut of Sabbath, the strut of Roxy
Music, the sheer wit ofTelevision and maybe a
touch ofWire,"Driver oftheYear’s ambition is
to usher in a pulsating, energized sound remi»
niscent of the Pixies and the French Kicks.
