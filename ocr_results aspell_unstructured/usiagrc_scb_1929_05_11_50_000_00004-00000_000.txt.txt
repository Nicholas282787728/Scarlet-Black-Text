Philadelphia Woman First Suggests
The Now Universal Mother’ 5 Day

 

Miss Ann Jarvis, a Philadelphia wo-
man, was the founder or Mother‘s
day, which is observed tomorrow
throughout the nation and the world.

The exact date of the origin or
Mother's day is uncertain, but it is
known that it was made a bill in
Congress in 1912. President Wilson
suggested the bill which was passed
and ordered the flag to be displayed
on this day. The second Sunday in

May was resignaled and Miss Jarvis
chose the red and white carnation as
the emblematic flower.

Miss Jarvis spoke of her plan to

On Other Hills

The following article appeared in

the last issue of the Knox Student:
"The future or the liberal arts coir
lege was the subject of the talk given
by Don Brodine, a representative
from Grinnell, in chapel on Friday.
This exchange of speakers between
Knox and Grinnell is in accordance
with a plan adopted last year.

"The problem presented to the lib-
eral arts college is a serious one, the
Speaker believes. Some think that this
type of school will disappear in the
future because of the rapid growth
and popularity of the junior college.
As one solution to this problem, the
speaker suggested the adoption of a
curriculum less elective than it has
been in the past, This system would
(end to make each student more truly

 

educated in a broad way. Also, each
graduate of a certain college might
be said to have a culture peculiar to
that College alone."

“Jesus helps character by making
men strong, pure, and helpful" was
the subject of the talks delivered at
.the Methodist church last Sunday eve-
ning by the college gospel team Corrie
posed pt Messers. Sneed. Puiney, and
