l‘rot. and Mrs. Main gave a re
ception Friday evening tor the
Senlor classat their beautifulhome
on High Street. Pauline Andlews
tnet the guests at the door. Prot.
and Mrs. Main and Dr. Steiner
received. Those of the present
Senior class who were with the
class as Freshmen. remembered
well the JuniorrFreshmen party
threeyears ago when Proi. and
Mrs. Main so kindly opened their
home to the two classes. So now
as Seniors they Count it not the
least of Senior privileges to be
entertained there again, especially
as it gave them an opportunity to
meet Dr. Steiner who is the guest
of Prof. Main during his stay with
us. The rooms were beautifully
decorated with Chrysanthemums.
Dainty refreshments were served
by Misses Ruth Willard. Mary
Raymond and Hanna Nollen. Durr
ing the evening the college quars

tette sang a number of times and
were heartily encored. There
were presentbesides the class, the
members of the faculty and a
number of the resident alumni.

ANNIVERSARY PROGRAM.

Next Friday evening. Novem~
bet 2]. will be given the anniver-
sary program of the Grinnell In-
stitute society.

The program is to be a typical
program, representing the work
actually done in the society. The
program will be given in Institute
liall, beginning at halt‘ past seven
andis open to the public, Open
meetings are not. often held in
the Institute,and it is hoped thata
large number of the students will
avail themselves ci this oppore
tunity to show their interest in
the work of the societies. The
object of the meeting. of course.
is to help increase the interest in
this side of the college lifeI and a
special invitation is extended to
those who are not in any oi the
societies.

 

PUDD‘NHEAD WILSON.

Considerable interest was mani-
fest among the students in the
production at “Pudd'nhead Wile
son” at the Colonial T h e ate r
Thursday evening. Mr. Wm, s.
Gill appeared in thetitle role. lriis
interpretation of the part was
above Criticism. Itwill be remems
bered by those who were here last
year that the Chresto»E|lis socie-
ties gave a very successtul presen—
tation of “Pudd'nhead Wilson”
last March. Hence there was
considerable interest by way of
comparison olthetwoproductions.
The general impression seems to
be that altho Mr. Gill and his
company excelled in the ﬁner
points of the actor’s art, their per~
tormance as a whole was not more
pleasing than that of the societies.

MR. Rucri-I’S VISIT.

Mr. Arthur Rugh, traveling
secretary otthe Student Volunteer
Movement, will speak to the stur
dents at 6:30 Monday evening in
the chapel. Mr. Rugh is a grade
uate oi Wiltenherg College. oi
Ohio. and besides being an active
leader in association work in his

Alma Mater he has served as cola
lege secretary of Ohio. Beneﬁted
by his experience in college work.
Mr, Rugh will bring to us some-
thing well worth hearing.

MISS EDMUNDS TENNIS cI-IAM-

PION,

Wednesday arternoon the ﬁnal
Contest of the women's tennis
tournament was played cit by
Rachel Ravel] and Bertha
Edmunds. Miss Edmunds has
been showing up well all through
the tournament and surprised
many by defeating Miss Ravell
in straight sets.

This ﬁnishes the tournament
and gives to Miss Edmunds the
title oi woman champion oi the
college.

The interest in tennis during the
rest of the year will doubtless be
strengthened when the women's
courts near the cottage. and the
men’s courts south otthe athletic
park, are ﬁnished.
