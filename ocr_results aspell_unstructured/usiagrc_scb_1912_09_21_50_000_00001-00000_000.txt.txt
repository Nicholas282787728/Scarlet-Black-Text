Mr. Hnr ey is a, graduate of the Univ
\‘elsity of Michigan where he was a
prominent figure in oratory and intor~
collegiate debate. Immediately after
graduation he entered Y. M. C. A. Work
and after proving his worth in state
Work he was made the traveling seere~
tal‘y oi the Colleges and Universities
oi the West. Later he was made th-
Nationsl Secretary or South Amer-ice.
and he has hut recently returned to re-
sume worlt among his own countrymen.‘
During his work in the southern con-
tinent he gained a. ready command of
the Spanish language and is an excel-
lent linguist, according to Guy Aldrich,
our own State Student Semeiaiy.

Perhaps the most significant and
noteworthy fact of Mr. Hui r123": colu-
ing is that he has, since his return
to the United States, been associated
with John R. Mott in his great Work,
Coming as he does from direct Contact

The scvcrdl policies or Grinncll coir

Marin at chapel, yesterday morning.

“Gl‘innell College is an institution
that appenls to men by developing culr

that groups will form but they are
ulllilte lorced groups which gather on
