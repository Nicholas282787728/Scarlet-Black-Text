informed on the issues which. he
deduces. is most likely here in
Grinnell.

Noni—Violence: The Active‘Alternative

My Nicholas McNainiii'ii

Last Sunday evening a group of
about 45 students met on campus
to View a slide/tape show entitled
"Active NonsViolence". and to
discuss the ways in which non
violent strategies have succeeded
and failed

The program was the second of
a weekly chapel service being olr
fered every Sunday night
throughout the semester

According to Chaplain l-taas. can
ordillator of the series. the first in
tention of the “Active Non-
Violence" program was “to fur-

Registrars Carter and Simon
were appointed to this position by
the county auditor's office upon
the recommendation of Crim,
Crim. as the Povieshiek County
Democratic Chair. recommends
19 individuals from anywhere in
the Povieshlek County area to theI
county auditor in order to tacitiate
the registering process.

Since the county Democrats
treat the college as a separate cn
tity. Crim thought that campus
registration would be more effec-
tive if the campus had its own
deputies. These deputies are
sworn in and must sign an oath
promising to uphold the United
States Constitution Deputies are
obliged to register anyone who
asks. providing their registration
materials are available.

Refusal to register someone is a
misdemeanor,

The second phase of the
Democrats' voter registration
drive entails weekly registration.
Carter and Simon hope to secure a
table in the Forum on Tuesdays
from 9 to 11 pm to register
anyone. Republican or Democrat.
who has not yet registered.

The third phase of the drive is a
room to room push for registrar
tion. Democrats will go door to
door asking people if they have
registered yet and if not. whether
they would like to. This drive will
continue until October 26, the day
before the last legal day to
register. This allows the Deputies
time to get the registration cards
into the auditor's office Saturday.
October 26.

Crim advises anyone who is con
sldering voting to contact one of
the deputies. By registering with a
mobile deputy. one receives his
receipt on the spot. whereas. if
one registers by card it may take
as much as 25 days to receive a
receipt, The last day to register by
card is October 12.

From the colonialists det'lanl
refusal to pay the British stamp
and tea taxes. to the nonrviolenl
demonstration against nuclear
weapons going on today. the show
follows chronologically the
history of nonviolent movements
in America.

The abolition 0| slavery. the
women's suffrage movement.
the rights of labor unions. the
campaign for_ civil rights. ending
the Vietnam War, and the Califorr
nia farm workers' struggle for

mentioned as examples of active

The Rosenfield Series

illegal immigration and the
state of democracy in .Anierica.
are two questions which might be
addressed as part of this year‘s
Rosenfield Lecture Series. accor-
ding to Joseph Wall. Rosenfield
professor and director ofthe pron
gram's public affairs.

All the plans have not been
finalized. Wall said. but the com»
mittee hopes to sponsor three ma
jor symposiums. along with in
viting a list of speakers which in
cludes William Mohrman. a Grins
nell graduate who now serves as
Legal Council to the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee for the US.
House of Representatives.

Wall hopes to have the terms of
the contract with Mohrman ap»

proved by the program committee
by early next week

Definite plans have been made
for a symposium to comr
memorate the centennial of
Eleanor Roosevelt. November 273.

Speakers for this symposium
will include historian Elizabeth

- Perry. of the tlniveristy of in-

diana. Perry will discuss the
building of a women's network in
the 19205.

Another speaker will be Estelle
Linzer. Mrs. Roosevelt's
secretary and close friend. Linzer
is now at the United Nations'
Association in New York City. She
will speak on Roosevelt‘s notions
of world peace and the role of the
United Nations.

A brief discussion ensued the
slide/tape. Several students ex-
pressed frustration that in years
of history classes the decisive role
of active non-violence had never
been pointed out to them. Others
commented that in the future they
would be ready to sight examples
for those who were skeptical of the
validity of nonviolent actions.

When confronted with the ap-
parent failures ot the modern
peace movement as a whole. some
students commented that the
structures \\ithin the movement
itsctt needed to be changed They
Said that the movement needs to
go trom hierarchial and patriars
chal Structures to ones more

grassroots oriented Someone

else thought the peace movement
lacked a strong charismatic
leader,

The absence of Gandhi or a King
may explain \\hy a true and
lasting peace movement today
needs to change themselves
beforc socicty atrlarge can be
altered, People's unwillingness to
suffer for things they bctivc in
might explain vvhy the peace
movement has not had a major
success in recent years.

‘ c committee is now process
iiig . proposal for a Spring Sym-
posium on the problems of illegal
Inimigiation. Much focus will be
directed towards the controvers
sial Simpson-Masseolli bill on US
immigration policies. Opposition
to the bill argued that this bill
discriminated against Hispanic
Americans.

Also under proposal is a sym-
posium on the state of democracy
in America today.

Details of this event have not
been worked out. Wall said. Wall
added that dates are still open on
the calendar and that the commit-
tee is still open to accept pron
posals from students and faculty
alike.
