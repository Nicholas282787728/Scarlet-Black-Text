Monologues Amuse

Holding a Valentine’s day aud.
ience at rapt attention in much
of her performance, Dorothy
Crawford monologued her way
into the good graces of a near.
chapelful audience.

Making a somewhat startingly
dishabillc appearance in a dress—
ing gown, she launched into her
first monologue without unne—
cessary ado, Her matron's
shower of emotion, though on anl
overworked theme, provided mo-
ments of real comedy and im-
mediately ingratiated Miss
Crawford with her responsive
_audience.

Her second monologue, per—
haps the most interesting of the
four, sketched three characters,

orm Selling

”There should be no regular
tan on students selling and see
liciting in the dorms," claimed
Janehagby, Read sophomore, at
the Student Council ‘ meeting
yesterday.

In a discussion which rivaled

thc student council 'presldency
campaigning in intensity,

started one of the most heated
discussions the Council has seen
this year.

“Little Deals"

Duane Blough, Council pl‘esi»
retoi-ted that there had to
be some control; otherwise, eag-
er salesmen would be running
from room to room putting over
little deals, When Jone retale
iated by saying, “It might be a
good idea," almost everyone on
the Council joined the discus
:ion. Beth Budd, Loose hall jun-
ior, joined her on this point by
commenting, “They’ve got to
learn sales resistance sometime,”

Sulesmeu Turned Down

“A lot of students don't rear
lize how many salesmen with a
product to sell are turned down
by the Student Organizations
Committee,” complained Lora
Lee Pugh, Read sophomore, She
sided with the majority of the
council members by maintain-
ing that if all the salesmen who
applied were allowed to operate
without restriction,‘ no one
would have any time of his
own. Prohibiting them’ protects
the students.

Under present regulations, the
only students who may sell any
thing in the dorms for profit
are those who, in the opinion of
the committee, need the money
and who have a worthwhile
product to offer which is not
sold in the bookstore.
