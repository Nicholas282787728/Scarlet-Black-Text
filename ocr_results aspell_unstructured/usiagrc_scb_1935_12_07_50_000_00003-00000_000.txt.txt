‘Last Supper’ Most Impressive Part
of Exhibit of Stained Glass

Different Pianels Create
‘Delightful Awe'
in Critic

By Henry Alden

The faculty dinner last Thur-s-
day evening marked the formal
opening in the recreation room of
the quadrangle of an exhibition of
stained glass from the D'Ascenzo
studios in Philadelphia, Pa. The
spectator-'s first impression is one
of delighted awe at the skill of the
arrangement by which the colored
glass panels are evenly lighted
from behind. The effect of the
myriad points of light as one steps
into the darkened room is breath—
taking; it is almost as if one were
watching brilliant sunlight stream
through the mullioned windows of
a medieval church.

Indeed, it is against the back—
ground of a knowledge of the Mid
dle Ages that one must study this
stained glass, which is most suc—
cessful when it is most medieval
It is the indcredibly vivid blue of
the facsimile of a 13th century
~medallion that first arrests the eye
wandering in a bewildered daze of
color; it was this replica of the due
cient craftsman‘s skill that caught
my fancy and held it.

Last Supper Impressive

Probably the most impressive
window in the collection is, how»
ever, "The Last Supper," with its
mosaic of brilliant biues and radar
Interesting, too, are the windows
designed for homes rather than
churches. The simplicity of the
“Canterbury Pilgrims," one of a
series to be used in a library, is
delightful; and the vignette of
“Wotan's F a r ewell" outlined
against a clear background _ and
destined to form one panel in a
window for a music room is equal-
Iy charming

The film that is being shown in
conjunction with the display at»
fords an imight into the modern
methods of making stained glass;
it is of interest to note further in
this connection the way in which
pieces of glass of uneven surface
and unequal thickness are used in
the windows to give the sense of a
third dimension and to vary the
intensity of the colon

Modern windows too Imitative

The artist and the craftsman
were one in the Middle Ages, and
a comparison of modern windows
with the masterpieces of the 13th
century leads one to wonder if per-
haps the modern world has not, in
this instance, lost something with
the advent of specialization. The
chief fault to he found with any
modern stained glass—less perhaps
with that of the D’Ascenzo studios
than with most exampleseis that
the art is too highly imitative, that
it seeks its inspiration too exclu-
sively in the great models of the
Gothic period. Most of the sub—
jects of the works in display are,
if not actually copied from painte
ings or from earlier examples of
stained glass, at least strongly
reminiscent of the masterpieces of
the past,

Such a deliberate attempt at ar-
chaic effect as in the portion of
the narthex window from the Rive
erside Baptist church in New York
City seems to me as indefensible
as the construction of a Gothic
building in the 20th century. Be-
cause I should like to see stained
glass give expression to a more
modern spirit, I was particularly
interested in the designs for the
windows at Kenyon College, which

 

portray various typical scenes oi
“Ploneer Days.” Even here, howe
ever, the style echoes weakly the
best academic manner of the nine-
ties.

Formal Design Most Legitimate

Perhaps the use of modern glass
seems most legitimate when em—
ployed in fonnal design as in the
sketch for the rose window in the
Central Methodist church in
Brooklyn, N. Y. I should like some-
time to see an abstract design by,
shall we say, Picasso, reproduced
in stained glass; or better yet, to
have some creative artist of Picase
50's or- inal genius express himself
in this medium. Then perhaps I
shall be convinced that stained
glass is not an anachronism but a
valid means for artistic expression
in the 20th century.

Such speculation as to the valid»
ity of modern stained glass is
pleasant, but one forgets it in the
sheer joy of sensual impression
produced by the exhibit itself. Each
spectator carries away with him a
lasting memory of glorious color
and a deeper appreciation of' one
of the supreme achievements of
medieval art.

Tenniquoil C ompelition
Won by Cleveland

Cleveland cottage continued to
lead in the women's intramural
competition after winning the Lena
niquoit tournament by defeating
Read cottage in the final round.
Cleveland now has a total of 61
points, followed by Read with 55.

Haines is in third place with
all points, Mears is next with 16,
followed by Main with 16 and
James with 15. ‘

Cleveland was represented by
Esther Peck, who downed the Read
representative, Edith Renfmw, in
a hard fought five set match. The
scores of the five sets were as fol-
lows: 1-6, 64, 0-6, 6-1, 876.

In the last two tournaments—
hockey and tenniquuitsiRead and
Cleveland have each won first and
seconds. Read won the hockey,
while Cleveland finished second,
and then Cleveland, reversing the
order, won the tenniquoits play
and Read finished second. The
archery tournament was won by
Haines cottage.

Melvin Rugg, Rochester univer—
sity freshman, travelled 21,000
miles to come to school.
