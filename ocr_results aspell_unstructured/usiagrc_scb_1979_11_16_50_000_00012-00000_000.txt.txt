Why didn’t m speak up?!

I’m not the kind oi person who
causes a commotion every time
Something occurs which I think is un-
fair. in fact, most times I‘m pretty
apathetic. which stems irom my
pessimistic attitude about beating the
system. However, something happen-
ed several weeks ago, something so
monumental in its implications, that I
had to “speak out” (no doubt that the
5&8 will censor my proiamty...ah,
c'est la vie...)

[Editor‘s note: The 5&8 policy is to
allow writers to express opinions
within the bounds of taste, slander,
and libel. Ms. Goodman's use of
vulgarisms ccl‘tainly adds to the tone
of the letter and is not tasteless If she
wants to reveal the extent of her
vocabulary, I certainly won't stop
her]

A few weeks ago, we had the show
ing Of Thc Big Bus in South Lounge.
Before the movie began, the usual an-
nouncement about no smoking or
drinking of alcoholic beverages was
made. However, the girl who made
the announcement added (and keep in
mind that this was a first): “...and the
movie will not begin until THAT disap»
pears,” and she pointed to a boy who
had just opened a can or beer.

Unfazed, the boy said, “Weill 0K...”

and oontinued leisurely to sip his beer.
Soon, two things became obvious: l)

the boy had no intentions of either
leaving or killing a treshly opened can
of beer; and 2) the girl who made the
announcement was going to do nothing
to hurry hilii along Do you know that
out. of a full audience, a full audience
which was witnessing a controversy in

action, a controversy that aiiected
theniithe only tucking comment

made was: “Hey, can't we do it
another way? Can't he drink it nuts
side?" After that was said, the aur
dience commenced in helpless,
aimless murmuring (so familiar to us
all, .) until the beer was eventually

. gone

:wliere do I begin? I am at a loss for
Words to express how shocked, appalls
ed, disgusted, and disappointed I am
at the audience's colitcnipliblc
behavior. Dare I go on to generalize
that that audience indeed represents
the entire Campus? “571 sure as hell
will! The Students in that crowd could
have done three things: A) sit like
dumb shits and wait until whatever
was delaying the showing oi the movie
was over; )3) start a collective uproar
tO-tlirow out the shmuck Wlth the beer
so that the movie could start; or C)
start a collective uproar to start the
movie, and who the hell cares about
one guy with one beer?

Granted, I would have been pretty
upset ii “B” had occurred, but at least
it would have shown that the students
here care enough about something to
cause a commotion, however screwed
up their priorities are. My beef in this
“open space" space is: WHY THE
HELL DIDN'T “C" 0CCUR????????
why didn‘t someone, or many people,
protest to the projectionist to Just start
the stupid movie?

When you come down toil, what is
wrong in drinking beer in South
Lounge? We—who used to bring bangs
and sixspacks in there last year to con-
certs—are now against one beer. Why
did the hongs and the sixspacks stop?
Well, because President Drake sent
out a letter to us all at the beginning
of this semester, saying that from now
on those things in South Lounge (and
other public places) are a nonn—and
what do we say? We say,
“Hmmmmm, well, OK,.." We don’t
even question it!!! We don’t even ask
hwhy?”

We have the 36:3, that “rad”
newspaper that uses curse words in its
publication (now, that'll Show ‘em,..),
that attacks the conservative VlEW'
points; we have the people who pro-
test the oncoming nuclear age; we
have the people who advocate solar
energy; we have the people who rally
against the killing of whales in
Greenland; we even have the people
who put a fucking bus together so that
they could join in the rally at Kent
State to protest the erection of a gym
on the site where the students were
killed in the ’60: riot there! What I'm
saying is: given, it's a circulated joke
around here that Grinnell is just a
sheltered little community, apart from
“real lite," a place where the “real ‘
world" doesn't really touch us. Yet
with this in mind, we still manage to
involve ourselves in issues that really
don‘t even effect us directly (such as
the aforementioned). Bu -- we say not
one word about beer drinking in South
Lounge (or rather, the prohibition or
it), and this is something that god
damn well affects us. We seem to pro»
test this and rally against that, yet
we're blind to the few things that real»
ly concern us, or should concern us.
I‘m beginning to see that the sorcalled
hippie radicals here (the people I used
to think were so cool and laid
back“), even they are becoming just
like our parents‘ generation: the
establishment, the ones who conform
to newly established rules without
even asking “why?"

Myself, I don’t even like beer. But
should a movie he held up until one

i.
to

person ﬁnishes a beer? When the rule
wasn’t eniorced last year or the year
before, we all liked it; it was nice to
drink a beer or two (or eighti While
watching a movie; it was a good
thing. Now. one lousy letter sent out
saying ”menu,” and we dumbly nod
our heads and conform. What happenr
ed to that protest spirit that we got a
glimpse oi when they reinstated the
“F" grade? What did the editors and
the subscribers of the 8&8, who might
have been at the movie, have to say?
Helpless murmuring, that’s what. And
lhate it and I think it’s contemptible
that you all conform so mindlessly.

When one just takes a minute to
think: why, WHY the hell was that
rule made", And why is it being en-
lorced now, after several years of non-
enlorcement’! I can understand and
even agree with the no smoking rule,
because smoke directly affects
another person negatively. ut beer?
Now some oi you might wr e, in
response to that question. “Well, beer
makes people rowdy and that affects
other people during a movie.” To that
l have two things to say:

17 Obviously that reason is not the
reasoning used by the people who
established the rule, because had the
boy with the beer left and drank the
beer outside, he would have been
allowed back iniyet the beer would
have still been consumed, hence he
could be just as rowdy The point here
against the “rowdy” reason 15 that it's
OK to drink a whole SlX‘paCk, let‘s
say, as long as it‘s outside of the South
Lounge doors, and then come back in,
but it’s not OK to drink a single beer
inside South Lounge (this is according
to the rule) I ask “why not?”

2i My second response is simple:
think back to the rowdiness that
sometimes occurs before a movie in
ARH, where beer has been consumcd
in great quantity. People throw
things, people yell things, people are
obnoxious, rowdy, randy, and quite
annoying, right? But think again the
fact is, 99% of the time the I‘OWdl ess
stops once the movie starts; and it,
perchance, it continues, people make
