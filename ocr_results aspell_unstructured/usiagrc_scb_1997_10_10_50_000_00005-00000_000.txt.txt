Dear Campus Community:

I write to you to offer an invitation
and an explanation. I also write
to question. ‘

I am a senior trying to start a new
college literary magazine. You‘ve
probably heard of the signs I put up
around campus about two weeks ago.
However, I don't think you had the
opportunity to see them. I will do
my
best. in light ofthis, to describe them.
The ﬁrst two signs advertised
mainly the name of my new publi-
cation, he 1g 9.] 5'5. On these
signs
were two pictures that were, by my
own admission, risque. One had a
woman dressed only in a corset sit-
ting on a stool. with the inviting
question of “Are you a bit erotic?"
as the banner. The other had a
depiction of an SIM (sadomasoch-
ism) scene in which the woman, the
dominatrix. was putting her sub into
check The banner on it read.
simply, “Submit."

I knew that some risk was involved
when I decided to put up the signs.
To give you some background, I
spent a Friday night poring through
site
after site on the World Wide Web,
trying to find pictures that weren‘t
that offensive. I picked the two that
I did because I) the pictures were
in sharp black and white, and 2) nei»
ther presented any objectionable
amount of nudity. In fact, the corset
sign had more nudity than the SIM
sign did I knew that the signs would
become targets; either the
offended or the enamored would take
them down to throw them away or
keep
them, respectively. So I made extra
copies (40 of each) and proceeded
to
put them in prominent places.

It does not surprise me to hear that
many of you have not seen these
signs. I noticed that most of them
were removed within the week. (The
ones I hung in my dorm were taken
down within two hours.) I was
disheartened by this because the
signs were made to attract attentio ,
no i 3‘ '
attention would be attracted by signs
no one saw. Still, I knew that
that was the risk of the publicity stunt
in the ﬁrst place. Sol
resigned myself and made new signs.

Perhaps you‘ve seen the new signs.
There are still a number ofthem
around. However, I doubt if you’ve
noticed them. because there are no
pictures on them. They‘re pretty
bland, in my book. The purpose of
the
new signs was to explain why the old
signs had the pictures that they
did. The new signs were printed ex-
pressly to be as inoffensive as
possible.

I'm writing because someone. or a
group of someones, has decided to
pursue the issue, even though I have
not pushed the envelope any further.
Someone has torn down even these
signs. the ones with no pictures. The
ones with only information about my
endeavor. The ones that don‘t
offend.

I will not lie. This upsets me. It
upsets me on many levels. The ﬁrst
is obvious: why would anyone con-
tinue to push this? The new signs
had
only text—why tear them down?
The only answerl have is this: some-
one
is still mad about the “degrading"
signs I had before, and this person
has decided to punish me for it. Well,
ﬁrst of all, let me say that I
didn't think that the initial signs I
hung were degrading, In fact. I
searched through site after tasteless
site in order to ﬁnd the best
pictures, particularly pictures that did
not show the woman in a position
of powerlessness, I am a feminist,
and I know that there are a lot of
feminists around here who would be
more than a little pissed off about
something like that. Secondly, yes,
you have punished me, whoever you
are who keeps tearing down my
signs. The information about my lit»
erary
magazine has been stiﬂed. I have yet
to receive any submissions. And I
have effectively wasted about ten
dollars, since I paid for all those

photocopied signs personally. I am
trying to bring into existence
another avenue for literary works; I
am trying to bring this project to
fruition. You have denied me almost
all of my ability to publicize. So
you have done your damage that
way.

I am also upset because the person
or group who is responsible for the
removal of my signs has taken the
cowardly route, On every one ofmy
signs are my email addresses and my
post ofﬁce box. All ofmy contact
information, except my phone num-
ber, is available, and yet no one has
written me anything. No one has
directly asked me why I put up the
srgns
that I did. No one has written to com~
plain. No one has had the courage
to come up to me. or write me email,
and explain why they think the signs
are offensive. The only objection
I’ve seen so far is a little scribble
on a sign in ARH, where someone
wrote “This is really offensive,” I
have
taken the pains to be available—Why
is everyone else involved being
anonymous?

Lastly, I‘m upset because this is re-
ally demonstrating to me how
censorious this campus is. For along
time. I denied that, I’ve been
here a long time. and even though
people tore down signs or whatever.
I .
just took it in stride. People would
tell me, “Oh, this campus is not
nearly as open—minded as people
make it out to be—my speech is
stiﬂed.

I feel silenced, you can’t really talk
around here about things that
matter." And I would debate these
people, because I sincerely believed
that you could talk about things here.
These days. I have been forced to
rethink my beliefs.

You see. to me. sex is something
that really matters. To me, sex is a
part of everyone’s life; everyone is a
sexual being. so there should be,
in my opinion, literary opportunities
for people who write sexually
explicit materials to have their work
taken seriously. I know thatl
would be more than apprehensive to

submit erotica to the tirinnell Re-
w

rt'o'th‘e’Frekhand, 'l‘lit
reason I’m starting Ihe V‘o g1
Isis. Iwanted to have a place where
others wouldn’t feel that
apprehension.

What these last two weeks have
proven to me is that I cannot have a
voice
about this. I can‘t seriously talk
about sex—I can’t even explain my
position on sex. Any mention ofsex
will be immediately taken care‘of.
Someone will ﬁnd a way to stop the
conversation. While I freely admit
that I was taking a risk by putting up
those signs (signs, I may add,
that did not depict sex, just alluded
to it). I am sad that people did
not engage in a debate with me about
it. They took it upon themselves to
silence me entirely, Why debate?
Censorship is much more direct and
effective.

So I am here to offer an invitation.
First of all. I want to invite all
who are interested to submit works
to lg; V'Q e; 5's. All submissions
are encouragedwwhile erotica has
been singled out. I am interested in
the whole spectrum of literature. My
only goal is to put out a quality
publication. My vax email address
is [dawkins], my MathLAN account
address is dawkins@math.grin.edu,
and my box number is 04-08, The
deadline for submissions is techni-
cally October 14, but interested
parties can submit any time before
fall break. I am extending the
deadline primarily because most of
the avenues of information available
to me have been cut off so far.

Secondly, I want to invite all who
are dissatisﬁed with the way in which
I have promoted my magazine to talk
to me. You can write to me. or you
can call me at x3621, or you can even
visit me, Ilive on Read first.

all, please, stop- taking down my

to spend ten dollars every week

Either way, though, The Viole 15';

To all Campus TMBG-lovers.
Every year, the Concerts committee
is faced with the task of booking
good hands. We, the undersigned.
feel that an effort should be made to
bring Brooklyn’s Ambassadors of
Love, They Might Be Giants,
toGrinnell. We have suggested this
to the Concerts committee. but have
been told that there are too many
people on campus that cannot stand
TMBG to warrant such an expense.
In our opinion, this is not the case.
First of all, booking TMBG would
probably cost about the same as other
well»known bands that have played
here like - Cake and Soul Coughing
— if not less. Second of all. we be
lieve that a large percentage of
Grinnell students would be in favor
ofa TMBG concert.

If you want to see TMBG perform
at Grinnell. evmail [CONCERTS]
and tell them so. In addition, there
will be a petition going around cam
pus. If you don't see it, vax
[ROGERS] or [STOHLER]. and we

will bring it to you. We can't be sl
lent. ‘cause They Might Be Giants.
Sincerely.

Dear Students:

Ask yourself who you miss more
living away from home- your parents
our your pets? If you answered the
latter you should consider the only

fuzzy-furry-cuddly volunteer oppor-
tunity that Grinnell has to offer: Sun-
day afternoon trips lo the animal
shelter in Newton. The Newton Ani-
mal Rescue League (NARL) services
Jasper County residents and is the
only shelter in the immediate area,
Students at Grinnell have been vol-
unteering at the shelter since 1995
when Students in Defense of Ani~
mals and the Environment (SDAE)
organized weekly visits. Sadly.
SDAE is no more and shelter veter-
ans like ourselves are trying to re- 7
kindle an interest for the sake of 56
homeless dogs. cats, puppies. and
kittens, This under funded shelter
cannot provrde for more than the
basic necessities of the animals and
thus our visits are one of the only
bright spots in their week.

We spend most of our time at the
shelter walking dogs (or maybe they.
walk usl). There are usually 20 me-
dium to large dogs and a litter or two
of puppies that need playing with.
The inside kennels are ﬁlled with cats
of all ages and sinaller dogs as well.
The cats love to be played with and
pelted, and it‘s wonderful to come
back every week and visit with your
favorites. of course- don‘t forget the
kittens! There are usually two or
three big litters, and they are quite a
handful. Deﬁnitely hard to resist)
There’s always more a shortage of
people than animals who need atten-

tion, so the more the merrier!

If this letter has sparked your inter-
est and you are an animal lover look-
ing to spread somejoy into the lives
of some very worthy critters, then
please plan to join us on our weekly
visits. We leave the forum parking
lot at 12:30 on Sundays, so show up
this weekend and come along for the
ride, If you've got your own car,
please bring it down as well- hope-
fully we’ll need more than one car!
If anyone has any questions or con-
cerns. drop an email to
[BENB ROCK] or [WATSONJ].
Thanks a lot and we’ll see you this
weekend!

Sincerely.
