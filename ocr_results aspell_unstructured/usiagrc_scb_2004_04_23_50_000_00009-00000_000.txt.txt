Grinnell’ 5 multicultural student groups play a critical role in supporting students and working for change on campus

by Emilia Garvey
It is well known that Grinnell College was established in
1346 as a staunchly abolitionist, libenl institution, which
would accept any black or female applicinrs ifrhey met the
colleges qualifications. What is less well known is that there
is no oiTicial record ofan African American graduate' in the
first 30 years of history

History of CBS

in the 1920s, the college community banded together to
form die “Cosmopolitan Club," in order welcome into the
community the recent infliotofinternarional students. How-
ever, because African»Amcriran studenc were also granted
automatic membership in the
club, some students quit die club
in protest.

Since minority students
starred enrolling at Grinncll, they
haveraccd racism, overt and 00-
vert. on mmpus and in town, In
response to these problems, stu
dent groups have been a driving
force in institutional and social
change.

Concerned Black Students
(CBS) was founded during a rimc
ofmany trials and triumphs ofrhc
American civil rights movement.
In the laro 19st around 30 black
students were enrolled at the college. which was more than
any class earlier that decade, and their numbers were rising
doc to active recruitment and student interest. During riie
same decade that Martin Luther King Jr. drew a crowd of
4,000 to Darby Gym, a number ofviolent attacks on black
students emphasized the need to bring the ﬁght forcivii rights
to Griniiell in o more immediate way.

CBS was founded by black students, for black students,
to demand what they saw as their needs and rights: mole
black faculty, better resources on black issues in the library,
more active recruitment oiblock students ofall backgrounds
and more active concern For black student voices.

Atabour 7:15 a.m. on November 29, 1971, almost all of
the school‘s black studenm walked into the library and chained
themselves inside, demanding more resources and support
from rhc college. Glenn leggert. who was President at rbc
time, negotiated with them well into the day, agreeing only
to demands he felt were under his control and that would
beneﬁt the student body as a whole, such as the institution of
a black library and a Black Srudiu concentration, which is
now Africana studies.

Ultimately, CBS had to continue [0 push to have its
voice heard. in 1972, with the help of Professor Virgimiis
Thornton, students set about moving books in the 20th cen—
tury room to make space for the black library, because the
college had not yet done so. oiher efforts such as the boy-
cotts ofrocist tovvn businesses and campus protests also con.
tributed to making cos o visible prcscncc addrcssing crucial
problems.

’ “The problems that students of
AfricaneAmen'can heritage have
are surprisingly similar to how
they used to be, but obvious
issues which were overt are now
covert and discreet.”

Forming new groups

A number olorher multicultural groups formed as need
and student interest coalesced in die late 1980:, including
Asian students in Alliance (ASIA), student Organimuon of
Latinos/Latinas (SOL) and Native American Students Alli-
once (NASA), Though all these groups are present today.
NASA faded out of existence in the early 90s because the
statistically tiny population ofNarive American snidenrs in.
volved in the group inevitably graduated. it was revived in
2001 by Melanie Yazzic 04, who came to campus assuming
that she would be able to join and play a part in a native
student group. I realised that there was no group, Yazzie
said, “and decided to start it up myself, with the old name,
and the dedicated support ofa
few good friends.”

Grinnellctillege'spopularion
ofstudenrs from different back-
grounds and different countries
has grown since the schools in
ceprion, and since the civil rights
movement, in turn changing the
membership of multicultural
groups. Whereas CBS began as a
group for AfricanaAmcrleans,
emulating the civil rights move-
ment, its membership now cm.

According to multicultural group leaders, the increased

ence. “Some people see SOL as the Mexican organization, '
said Juanita Nesvton, 04, president oFSOL. But theie are
people from diirercnr backgrounds, remembering their dif»
rerenr cultures and trying to keep a part orthem at school."

Adam Aguirre ‘06, SOL Public Relationsdircctor, agreed.
“Latino is a U5. construct. Where manysrudenncomo From,
they're not a minority,” he said. “There is no single Latino
experience. This group is multicultural within irselh“

Anorherehallenge that continues to impact multicultural
groups is the changing nature of racism in America. “The
problems that srudenc of AfricnneAmerlcan heritage have
are surprisingly similar to how they used to be, said Levy,

but obviousiy issues which were overt are now covert and
discreet.”

According to Levy, a shortage of diveise viewpoinu in
the classrooms is one example of the increased subtlety of
racism. “An elite liberal education leaves a lot be desired,” he
said. Because otthc traditionally Euro-centric locus oimany
classes at a liberal arts college lilte Gtinnell, students from a
variety ofbackgrounds struggle to be heard and to hear simi-
lar perspectives expressed by others. “Within the classroom
and outside it can be challenging to express minority views,
especially when no effort is made by rhc facilitator to hear
those perspectives,“ levy explained,

Currently, inside and outeoferheeclassroom apathy can be

disappointed by student apathy, “As srodenrsofcoloron libe
eral arts campus, you come into it really optimistic with lots
ofmomentum and adrenaline, and you hirwails ifrhere aren't
enough people to support it," she said.

Brainstorming solutions

Although the college administration works to increase
academic diversity, some say that student input is needed to
address the shortcomings of these eﬁrortsi For example, the
Minority Scholars in Residence (MSIR) progiam brings in
shortatcrm minority faculty bur snidenrs find the temporary
status of the faculty troubling. Yazzie described her experie
ence trying to show support for Craig Howe. a Native Ameri-
ean MSIR who taught ashorteouisc on “Tribal Landscapes
and ldenririd" this spring. “Hews well qualified, and every
one wanted him here,” said Yazzie, “We just ﬁnished a letter
campaign to prompt the administration to seriously consider
hiring him and were met wnh a piiinil response. students
should be involved in ii ie process, rake the initiative to write
letters and use iheir education to voice dieir opinions."

According to Levy, another way students can be actively
contribute to increasing campus diversity is to “take the ini-
tntive to know our history, and go beyond the classroom to
do so For example, speakers and student panels that
multiculmml groups bring to the campus community can
provide viewpoints missing from the classroom SOL is also
stressing the importance ofsrudent experience. “This year
were focusing on voices ofstudeno, explained Aguirre, “Arid
we are learning from the people we have here

Cultural space also reinans an important user in the ef
[cm to build a community in which multicultural students
feel comfortable. The Black Cultural Center was founded in
1959, and other student groups worked throughout die 90s
to ﬁnd spaces or their own.

Martha Hernandez ‘04, SOL treasurer describes the
group's oﬂiee as a “space to vvareh him, do homework, have
meetings, and have fun as well. it combines both the aca-
demic and the social."

Plans for the new campus center take into account the
importance ofthese spaces. As the proposal states, the need
for multicultural space “has formed the underpinning for the
consideration and creation ofthe campus center.” The pro
specrive design will be “a “pod’ concept with sever—ii speciﬁc
orifices, The ofﬁces would be assignable to a particular group
while it exists on campus-for some groups diar might very
well mean for a number ofyears."

Multicuiniral student groups have challenged many probv
lcms, but it is dimeulr to make concrcre changes when mem-
bers of the community are constantly leaving. “Change is
inevitable," said Levy. “The college gets new students, new
administrators, The transient nature ofbeing a Student leads
to a somewhat regressive nature ofrhe group. There is a ten
dency for organilatlons to do the same thing."

Despite thclrcontlnually changing membciship, student
groups on play apart in Ll’lcsrruggl: fordiversiry that other
parts of the college community mn’r, “its msier for institiie
tions and individual to b: reactive then proactive because
people lose sight of persisting issues," said Levy. “student
groups can lead the way in being proactive.”
