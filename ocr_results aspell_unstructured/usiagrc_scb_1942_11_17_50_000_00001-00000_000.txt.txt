Bauer Concert
Very Successful,
Critic Reports

By David Meade
Completing his two-day engage—
ment on the Grinnell campus Sun—
day afternoon, Harold Bauer, one
of America's most noted pianists,
produced one and one-half hours
of complete enjoyment for the
small but extremely appreciative
audience in Herrick chapel.

Bauer played expressively
throughout the concert, perrorm—
ing especially well the third num»
ber, Beethoven's “Moonlight Sona-
ta." Also highlighting the pro—
gram was “The Sunken Cathe-
darl” by Debussy, before which
be picturesquely related the leg-
end of that French composition.

It goes without saying, how—
ever, that one of the most beau-
tiful pieces he played was the en<
core, “Jesu, Joy of Man's Desire”
by Each.

Other numbers played by Bauer
were from Handel. Schumann,
Brahms, Schubert and Chopin. As
can be seen, the concert was well
balanced with a refreshing vare
iety supplimenting the master‘s
touch.

Brown Derby Ouf, Buf
Only Temporary Ac‘rion:
Zephyr Will Continue

The Crinnell Chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi, sponsors of the Brown
Derby and Zephyr, have applied
for inactive status for the dura-
tion, Charles Glamen, secretary,
announced last night.

The application is now before
the executive council of the na«
tional organization, according to
a letter received from James c.
Kiper, executive secretary.

The declaration of inactive sta-
tus does not constitute suspension
of the chapter. or surrender of
the charter. With only two active
members this year, and with po-
tehtiel pledges preparing for war
service, active
campus affairs became impossible,
Glamen said.

The Brown. Del-by, traditional
informal dance, is definitely out
of the question for the duration,
Glarnen added. However, with a
successful year already begun by
Zephyr, the other SDX project,
that publication will continue.

Kiper announced in his letter
that notification of the action
will be sent all Gnnnell spx
alumni. Files of the chapter will
be sent to national headquarters
in Chicago for safe keeping until
the reestablishment of an active
Crinnell unit.

English Literature,” by Paul

Spenser Wood, head of the Grin-
nell English department, will be
released by the MecMillsn com—
pany of New York within a few

dy of literature, the twc»volume
work is the result of several
years of study by Wood, assisted
by Miss Evelyn Mae Boyd, of the
English department, whose name
also appears on the title page.

Approaching the subject by re-
presentative authors rather than
many writers, Wood has included
a great deal of the writing of
only 22 English men .of letters.
The book begins with Chaucer
and ends with Arnold, and in»
cludes biographies and necessary
history to span the periods inter—
vening between them.

Line drawings of maps of Great
Britain are included before each
section, listing the places import—
ant to each author, Wood said.

An idea of the type of coverage
given each aumor is given by
some statistics regarding the
book, Ten thousand words are

printed from Milton’s works, 21,—
500 from Addison and Steele:
47,000 from Carlyle; and 600,000
from Arnold.
