Malloy was bent in Norfolk, Vir-
ginia, but with her father being an

martial arts, a passion which she has
carried to this day. While she has

studied Tai Chi, Tai Kwon Do and
many others, her martial art of choice
is Wing Chung Gung Fu.

is not every day that a rock leg-
end with a number one album in
the college charts performs at
Grinttell, Usually mat happens after
the act plays Grinnell, like Smashing
Pumpkins and Soul Asylum, for ex-
ample. Sebadoh is an exception,
antman Lou Barlow is best
known forhis time spent playing bass

his split irl 1989, Barlow hasbeen hard
at work on many four-track record-
ings and other projects.

In 1991,5ebadohlllwasreleased
on the Homestead label which ftnnly
assured Sebadoh a spot in the indie
scene, Sebadoh moved to Sub Pop,
the same people who brought you

In 1993, Sebadoh’s second re-

To try to describe Sebadoh is al-
most an impossible task. They are a
typical Sub Pop act They provide
hours of drone rock, supplemented
with a whimsical sense of humor, and
will leave you drained and moved,
Sebadoh, next to Velocity Girl, is one
of Sub Pop‘s biggest now these days.
Tonight's petfonnance will be a goat
opportunity to get a grip on this thing
people are calling ‘alternative music.’
Thetennisadead concept, butSebadoh
came out of the ashes of what people
are now calling grunge,

According to Barlow, “5th
is just all about defeating the fear of
failure, of saying exactly what you
want to and playing the kind of music
you wantto, with people that you like.
Each of us is slowly overcoming the
fear of being a rock musicians and
having some integrity about what we
want to say. That’s what Sebadoh is."

Opening for Sehadoh will be

Forthoseof you whorememberHip—hop

her stress level during a build or run of a

show can be extensive.

Besides designing costumes and
martial ans, Malloy runs a wearable art
businem In graduate school she learned
to weave her own fabric and modify
fabric through dyingandprintingandhas
been hooked ever since. Most of her
work is clothing, but she has recently
done a lot with dolls. Her work has been
exhibited nationally in galleries, exhibi-
tionsandctaft fairs,and herdesigns have
been published in textbooks.

While Malloy really does enjoy
doing theatre, shcdoes not fully enjoy
the strossplacedon hermindartd body.
When she is not working on a show,
shedocs not gowseeany herself. She
would like to adjust her life so that she
only designs about one or two shows
each year, Lhe rest of her time being
spent with her business, Eventually,
she will quit theatre and devote herself
to her business full-time.

Forthose interesued in starting out
in costume design, she strongly sug»
gests ﬁnding a good teacher whom
you can learn a lot from and learning
how to draw well, Malloy places a
strong emphasis on costume render-
ings as a means to demonstrate your
intentions for each character to the
director. Being able to nansfer a rene
dering onto the stage and knowing
howtosewaretwo other dais that she
feels are necessary. This weekend at
Vinegar Tom, you can see how well
she has done with her renderings.
