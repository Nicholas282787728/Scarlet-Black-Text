Al Political Parley

By Smﬁ Reliorter

A conference for discus-
sion 01' the “moral, cultural,
economic and political rec
sources for international co-
opcl-utioll” was held here
last weekend. Under the
partial sponsorship of the Grim
nell Institute of International
Atlairs, the conference consist-
ed of five meetings, each hav-

topic, but all integrated into the
one theme.

Theodore Andersson, director
oi the foreign language program
of the Modern Language asso-

conference. He spoke on “The
Role of Foreign Languages in

Andersson stated that the

Russia could no longer accuse
us of imperialistic motivation,
aid would be given in the term
most useful to the people and
other countries would give aid.
Therefore, we would not have
to contribute as much as we do
now. Stoessmger added that Ame
