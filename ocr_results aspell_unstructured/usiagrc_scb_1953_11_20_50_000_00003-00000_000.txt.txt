this.

Basketball coach John Pfisoh
will officially unveil his 1953-54
Grinnell cage squad for the
first time next Friday night
against Central college at Pella.

The Flying Dutchmen of Cen-
tral gave the Pioneers quite a
scare in last year’s opener as
they led 35732 at the half before
succumbing to Bob Winter’s 15
point second half splurge, 72759.

The Dutch are led by speedy
frn-ward Amle‘ Ver Hoef who
tallied 21 points last year to
lead both teams in scoring
Winter, ‘l-leld‘ scoreless the first
half, was second with 15, fol-
lowed by Dick von Maur who
scored 13 markers.

In Season final:

Ffltscl-l‘s gridders seemed to be
heading for another dismal sea-
son. But when the Pioneers
tripped up the seventh place‘

\weekend, they began to shake
loose the defeatist‘attitude that.
has accompanied the Grinnell
gridders for the past few years.
'Before the Pfitschmen could
firmly grasp a winning way,
they ran up against two power-
ful elevens, St. Olaf and Wa-
bash. The Oles outclassed Grine
hell to the tune of 60~12, and
Wabash triumphed 33—12.

After these two discouraging
defeats, the Pioneer gridmen
returned to the win column on
Homecoming day. when Car—
mall’s Rams fell victim to an
inspired Grinnell team, 2776.
Carleton’s Knights had a rough
day when the Pioneers visited
their Northfield, Minn field,
and gave Grinneli ins second
win in their three game streale
by a 7-6 score. Monmouth, who
for three weeks set the pace in
the Midwest loop this year,
fell 32-24 to the Pioneers in a

 

seersaw . battle.

crisscrossed for years as each
worked hard to make a career.
Finally, Gowcr, back from
Service, "teamed up" with
Marge. After months of
strenuous rehearsal, they
were a sensation, creating
original "dance stories" for

are now Mister and Missus.
