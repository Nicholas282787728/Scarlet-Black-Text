Closes Series with Discussion of
Practical Present Day Lord-
ship of Christ. ‘

/
Continuing ’bIS general theme,

"Christ And the New World,”‘Dl‘,
Oberlin college, concluded the series
of Gates Memorial lectures Thursday
and Friday mornings at the chapel
hour.

Thursday he spoke or "Religion as
Friendship.” "The greatest commantL
ment is ‘to love‘" said Dr. King in
opening his address. "our relation to
God is a personal one; only in God is
personality perfect, The conditions
of a deepenrng spiritual lite are con-
ditions or a deepening acquaintance
with God. The conditions of sounding
a deep and lasting iriendship are
three.” He proceeded to point out
that these are mutual self—revelation
and an answering trust, mutual salts
surrender, and some deep community
or interest. -

Friendship Unconscious Growth.

“Friendship is largely an uncon—
scious growth, nut a conscious achieve-
ment, Love is best deﬁned as the
giving at one's self.” Dr. King went
on to show that friendship with God
is based upon the same principles as
friendship with man. “Any friendship,
that is friendship, is worth expression.
Small things are greater tests or
friendship than large things. The
subtlest test of triendship is sacred
reverence for the personality or a
triend."

In his Friday morning lecture, Dr.
King hrieily reviewed his theme tron:
its psychological, scientiﬁc, historical.
and personal aspects, and then spoke
or the present day, practlcal lordship
