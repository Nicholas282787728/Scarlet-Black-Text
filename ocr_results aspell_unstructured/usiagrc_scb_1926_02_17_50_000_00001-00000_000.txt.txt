CHOIR APPEARS AFTER GAME

Music llussr n rensauts sing
While Pulling barges.

Russia is noted for producing more
basses andbctter basses than any oth»
er countr and Grinnell lovers of var
cal music will get a chance to hear
some of the best hass singing when
the Russian Symphonic choir appears
at Herrick chapel Friday night at
eightethirty.

It‘ls legendary in Russia that an
angel once organizing a choir of si
hundred voices, had many applicats
who could sing soprano, aito, con-
tralto, tenor, and baritone, but only
one bass, a Russian. When the first
rehearsal was called, however, that
solitary Russian bassoml'ofundo cove
ered all the other six hundred voices
of the celstial choir.

To Feature Boat Song

One of the most important numbers
on the program of the choir will he
the “Volga. Boatmen” song, Folk»
songs are essentially the expression
at a nation’s soul, and therefore more
or less local in appeal, and are rarely
appropriated by people or other
lands. A few folk—songs with a par—
ticular human appeal, have become
known the world over, and the
"Volga antmen" song like "Home,
Sweet Home," and “Swanee River," is
one of this class.

The chant of the toiling masses pull»
ing barges up on the Volga must have
struck a responsive chord along the
Mississippi, the Rhine, the Seine, and
perhaps even on the Nile. At any rate
it is widely known and appreciated,
but it takes a. real Russian to sing
this song to perfection.

Glee Club stages Concert

The Russian Symphonic Choir has
been in great demand at college music
courses all over the country, particul—
arly where the college has a men's
glee club. The concert Friday night
has been arranged through the efforts t
of the Grinnell Men's Glee club. and is
being presented under their auspices.

During its first short musical tour
last season the Russian Choir appear- t
ed at Columbia university of New C
York, Winthrop college in Rock Hill,
Converse college in Spartanburg, the
University of Virginia in Charlottes—
ville, “'uman's college in Sweet Rriar,
Purdue university in Lafayette, Uni-
ve - ‘ity of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and
St. Mary's college at South Bend. In-
diana.

The itinerary of the choir this year
will include concerts at the state uni-
versities of Iowa, Louisiana, Okla.
homa, Kansas, and Indiana, as well
as Coe College, Kansas State Teachr
ers college, Wellesley college at Wellr
esley, Mass, Marietta college at Mari-
etta, ohio, and Omaha Technical high
school.

The Drake game will he called at
7:15 rind the concert at 3:30, so the

Sophomores Mill Flcslllucll Play to
Tie ill Opening Contest of
Women’s Basketball Tourney.

when sopbs clashed with preps in
women's basketball Monday afternoon
in the women’s gym a 28-28 tie was
the result. Called at four- hirty and
witnessed by a fair crowd of routers,
the game promised to be a rather
slow but easy victory for the sopho—
niurcs at the end of the first half was
changed to an exciting contest when
the freshmen displayed unusual DSP
and fight with the opening of the Seer
ond period.

Although the game was erratic,
with frequent fumbles and fouls, there
were flashes of real speed on the part
of both teams, Margaret Stevens,
second year forward Wits easily the
star of the game, ringing up a, total
of eleven baskets and two free throws
for 24 of the sophomores’ 28 points.
Helen Rbinehart, freshman captain
tallied s baskets for a total of 16
points, running Stevens 51 close seer
and for the number of baskets made,
while the playing of Elizabeth Wile
son, Freshman forward, was charilCr
tori d by unusual speed and uncl-l-ing
accuracy in the second half, with
three baskets and six free throws. The
game was brought to an exciting Cli-
max, after running neck to neck
all through the last quarter a basket
by Rhinehal’t in the last minute of
play tied the score.

or the Sophomores, the work of:
Augusta Towner at guard was out
standing and Margaret Jenkins, it
iam Metcalf and Priscilla Lieber-
knecht, playing against superior
weight, displayed pep and light
enough to overcome it. Corinne
Schwartz at side center showed
flashes of real speed. The team work
of both teams was somewhat shaky,
doubtless due to unexpected substi-
tutions in the last day or practice.
Both teams however promise to offer
strong competition to the juniors,
present cup holders. The lineups were

Friday Drake will oppose the Grin-

court, in what might be termed the
“battle of the basement.” An air of riv—
alry e ' LS between the two institu-
tions which turns the athletic contests
into It Species of gl'ude fight. Either
u uld declare the season successful
if it could triumph over the other.

At present the Bulldogs have lost
seven games and won two from
Amos. They liowed twice before Ok-

once Nebraska.

Captain Mark Mantz plays at cen—

Everett Leading Scorer

“Chuck" Everett, the diminutive
forward who Spelled defeat for the
Pioneers last winter is again holding
the Snot—light for the Drake aggrega-
tion. His basket eye has put him in
twelfth place among the Valley scor—
ers, and his slashing offensive game
has featured Drake's stubborn fight
against their opponents. He is one
or the fastest men in the conference
and makes up in fight, the disdtlvztnt<
age of stature.

"Barney" Meyers a sophomore who
llecamu eligible only four weeks ago,
has only participated in four valley
games, but has star-tied the fans by
collecting a total of ‘forty points. He
rang up six baskets apiece against
Kansas .1le Nebraska. His floor game
fast and he can shoot from any posi-
tion. This scoring spree has placed
him in seventeenth place in the score
his list.

sunpson Shows Up Well

Clarence Simpson, another sopho—
more has been subbing for Captain
Manta, and has shown up very well.
In his four games be has scored
twelve points. His {1001‘ game has
made him center of the Drake offense,
with Everett and Meyers working the
corners. .

Jebens and ci-onenbcrger, also
sophomores, have been getting the
call at the guards, They are rather
small men to compete against some of
the giants in the conference, but
have put up stubborn fights against
these odds. Jehuns is a fast man and
succeeds in getting the ball out of his
own territory in rapid fashion.

TAYLOR SMASHES
ANOTHER RECORD

l’illllrer Flush Ill World’s Record
in Si) Yard LOWS in New York
Meet.

Morgan Taylor smashed another
World’s record Saturday night, this
time the 80 yard low hurdles, at the
Wilco A. A. games in New York City.

Taylor's feat was the outstanding
performance of the meet, in as much
as the previous record had stood for
seventeen years. Forrest Smithson
of San Francisco set the former
mark of :09 6‘10 on Feb. 19, 1909, but
Taylor clipped Lbree-tenths of a Sec-
ond off the previous time.

Taylor's performances on the in-
door tracks the last few weeks have
been amazing. He formerhr made his
best showings in the longer distances
but the rats at which he has cut down
the marks for [he ' shorter events
Seems to prove that he has almost
equal ability in that field. When any
man clips three-tenths of a second
off a World’s record for such a. short
distance as eighty yards, he is in I

 

class, practically by hlmself.
