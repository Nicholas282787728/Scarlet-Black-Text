“VARSITY" VS. HALLS

Two house dances a year are too
many, says the social committee oi
faculty and students. some of the balls
do not think so. The result is a ilis~
pute which is difficult to settle. The
student council is going to have a
committee composed oi students from
both dormitories and cottages thresh
the matter over.

The main argument against two
house dances is that they will cut
down on attendance at "varsities." It
is claimed that if each building and
cottage is allowed to have two social
functions the week ends will be taken
up so that there can be no allrcollege
dances except the iormals. There is
some truth in that point or View.
"Varsities" not large
crowds where there are olie or two

will draw
building affairs going on.

Some oi the buildings wanting
more than one social function declare
that the financial reason is not a
good one, They even declare their
willingness to pay to the social com

mittee the amount lost on “varsities”

does that the social committee will
be paid for dances which scarcely"
“0 one attends.

Probably the financial consideration
is not so important as a principle in-
volved. Buildings are acting mare and
more as separate units and if they
are allowed to have more than two

in that direction. The number of 3.117
college suciai affairs will correspond:

The matter of house dances is small

L. v. Phelps rcccivcs a posmoli at

athletes that deserves recognition is
