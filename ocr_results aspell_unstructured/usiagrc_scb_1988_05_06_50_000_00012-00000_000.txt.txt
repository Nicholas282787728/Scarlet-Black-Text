As a Grinnell sports ran, in tour
years I have seen the Grinnell toot
ball team rise from a rebuilding
program, crumble, and now try to
rebuild again. i have seen the
men’s basketball team also go
rrom close to 500 in my ﬁrst two
years to the struggling team it is
now. I have seen fire and i have
seen ram. And I have seen boring
games that I thought would never
end. But I’ll still have many
memories oi the close and exciting
games inside Darby Gymnasium.
Both teams deserve better luck
and success in the ruture, On the
other hand, the soccer team and
theswimming teamshave been the
paradigms or success. These
teams have demonstrated that the
name Pioneers does not have to
conjure up an image aliasing. Dur»

about Grinnell sports in any major

probably have to invent a loyalty to
a big-name university in order to
maintain any interest in college

Thanks for

when you attend an institution that
prides itself on its academic
reputation rather than its athletic
reputation. The only problem with
a solely academic reputation is
that at most bars. the conversa-
tions tend towards bragging about

tainment i would have transferred
to UNLV or Dklahoma, With the
myriad or problems iniesting coir
lege athletics, Grinnell College
should be proud that athletics here
are played in the true spirit ot
amateurism, There are no scholarr
ships tor athletes, nor any bribes to
attract highschool All-Americans.
Every athlete at Grinnell is a
student-athlete, whereas at most
schools a true studentrathlete is as
hard to tind as Amelia Earhart.
Having student-athletes on the
playing ﬁeld made it much more
enioyable to root, root tor the home
team. The players are viewed as
human beings. not inter-
changeable parts of an athletic
machine. The mistakes on the hold
are human mistakes, not un-
torgivable sins. Personalizing the
action on the iield demonstrates a
truism lost on most college cam-
puses: sports is yust a game.

Throughout my babblings in this
column. 1 have tried to stress
that lost truism. Sports is tor enn
joyment not only [or the atiilete but
also tor the tan Untortunaiely.
American culture has blown the
importance or sporLs out or proper
tion. Grinnell College presents the
proper mixture of the importance
or college athletics. College life
should not center around the suc-
cesses and iailures of a sports
team. There is too much more to
lite than just sitting in the stands,
screaming your head oil tor the
sake or school spirit, Watching and
talking about sports has and
always will be a big part ctmy lite,
and watching Grinnell athletics
has been a part or my Grinnell Ex-
perience, But most importantly, it
is only one piece oi a complicated
puzzle that has rormcd my Grinr

Ruggers

Stumped
by Luther

by Julie Slivinsky

The score was 18-0, but don‘t be
tooled: the women’s rugby club
played an amazing game two
Saturdays ago against Luther Col-
lege, The game highlighted Grinr
nell's protound progress this
semester. with the ruggers holding
Luther to only three trys, a new
record.

Grinnell l'ans lined the field at
the club's first home game to
watch the women win over half of
the serum downs and keep the ball
over the Sonyard line ror extended
periods or time. “The teams were

’very wellrr'natched,” said Grinnell

captain Julie Sli risky, “The score
doesn’t Show it. but it was a close
game. Next time we play Luther,
we have a good change or beating
them,"

in the week before the game, the
ruggers had worked on making
qmck kicks and prompt passes,
both of which aided in the added
alacrity ot play. ”We weren't
afraid to kick the ball. and that
made the game much more ex»
citing," commented Lara "Scrum
Goddess” Pugleilll. “There were
quite a iew times when we kicked
the ball out [of bounds] and pro»
bably saved a try."

Backs such as Michelle “Get me
the ball’' Williamson. Kirsten
~Powerdrive" Flnlaysen. and

. Elana “The rookie" Behar made

several strong surges through
Luther’s defense and Came close lo
the try zone more than once, The
Grlnnell backs also played
dynamite defense against Luther.
including Luther‘s infamous "Lits
tle Blue Tights," a rugger known
tor her speed, At the expense of
knees only recently healed from
the previous game against Iowa Cls
ty, the Grinnell ruggers made
many marvelous tackles. Astoun-
ding secondrhalf play by Cindy
“Tackle Queen” Jones in par
ticular forced fear into Luther
hearts,

on the tield. the ruggers drained
a keg, but Grinnell still couldn't
Catch Lumer's lead at the drinking
game and vowed to practice over-
time to present a challenge at the
next boat races.

The past week's practices have
been impeded by rain, but the lug-
gers may host a game this Sunday
against 5t. Ola: College, so watch
tor posters around campus. The
women’s final home game will be
Saturday, May 7, at a time to be
announced. Grimell hosts Luther
and lowa City in what promises to
be a tough tournament. “We aren‘t
kidding when we say that women’s
rugby is more than just some pret-
ty shirLs,” said Beth “Bruiser”
Painter. “Everyone should Come
out and see what we mean."

This is the last

issue of the
