Volleyball Summaries-~-

Dibble, Souih Read Shine

The third and fourth round of the
Volleyball intramural tournament
came to a closc last night with
Dibble’s defeat of a scrappy town
team.

With the game count one and
one, the Town boys seemed head-
ed for certain victory with a
ten-point lead in the third con-
test. staging a teriifio rally, how-
ever, Dibule managed to tie the
some before the Town men woke
up. From there on, the lead
changed hands several times, Dio-
we finally winning the most ex-
citing gome of the season.
South Rend~Gntcs

South Road staged an upset
last night, defeating Gates, 16-14,
3-15,1s-14. Piaying steady ball
when it counted most, the male
Quadites squeezed out the need-
ed extra points in the first and
third encounters. Gates hit their
stride only in the second game,
shellsoking the eventual Winners
in that round by a 12 point mar-
gill.

---for Tuesday‘s Matches

Clark bowled over its hereto-
fore undefeated rival, Rawsoll
Hall, Monday night with compar-
ative ease. It was Rawson's first
defeat after three straight wms.
The scores were 11-0, and 15-13.
Saturday’s Games

In the Saturday afternoon
games, Gates handed Dibble their
second loss of the season, wni-
niiig the first two games by a
narrow margin, 15-13, 15-15.

The Town teem broke into the
Wm column by detecting an iii-
experienced North Read outfit
in two straight games. The Town
boys showed poor form, but the
Read boys looked even poorer
in one of the duller matches of
the season.

In the final game Saturday
Rawson had little trouble defeat-
iiig South Read. After taking an
11-0 trimming in the first game,
South Reed came back strong
only to be repelled 15-13, in the
final encounter.

Smii‘h Mon. Nigh'?

Fighting North Read subdued a.
touted smith outfit in three setj‘
Monday. The game appeared to
be in the bag for Smith as it held
a 10-3 lead in the second set af-
ter winning the first.

Smith had not reckoned with
the courageous spirit of the North
Read hoys, however, who are de-
termiiied to be compensated some-
what for their dismal football sea-
son. They rallied and snngged the
second set, 15-13. ’Playlng excel-
lent ball, North Road rode into a.
14-4 lead in the third set on the
wave of the second set rally.
Casterline of Road saved one of
these points when he grabbed
Roose's left foot, saving his tot-
tering teammate from commit-
ting a foul by falling over the cen-
ter line.

Then Read faltcred as Smith
drew the count up to deuce-at 14
all. At. this crisis North Read
cliched for two straight points
and victory.
