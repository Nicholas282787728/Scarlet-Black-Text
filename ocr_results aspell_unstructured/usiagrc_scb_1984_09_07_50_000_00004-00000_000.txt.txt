Dems and GOP -

no solution

It is sometimes difficult for our “born-again, self-
righteous. moralistic politicians to realize that a Russian
child (or any other human being, for that matter) is not a
small cog in an Evil Empire that ought be reduced to an
“ash heap of history."

It is even more difficult for our policymakers to realize
that socialist, Islamic, African, and other diverse nations
and cultures have the right to exist and thrive, and that it
is not our moral imperative to intervene in their affairs,

Ronald Reagan jokes of “outlawing Russia forever” by
means of nuclear war, and impose a trillion dollar
defense budget. Which is the bigger joke is questionable.
Neither is funny, neither can be forgiven. Clearly the
Reagan administration‘s fanatically anti—communist
defense policy and foreign policy is bringing us closer to
nuclear disaster than any previous administration’s
policies.

Walter Mondale supports a Defense budget increase,
the peacetime draft registration, Cruise and Pershing ll
missiles, and refuses to rule out the possible use of US.
forces in Central America. Admittedly Reagan is more
dangerous in his uninsightful non-intelligent nuclear
policy playing God with the lives of billions. However, it
is totally incomprehensible how Mondale, a politician
campaigning on a “peace” platform, can back Cruise
and Pershing II missiles, two of the greatest threats to
peace in recent years.

Both candidates are headed in the same direction in the
race toward nuclear disaster, one is just headed there a
little slower.

Not always blatant in their rhetoric and propaganda
(especially Reagan’s Newspeak: “Peacekeeper”

missiles, “Build-down” policy, etc), both candidates,

nevertheless, reflect militarist-expansionist ideals in
their actions and policies. Both continue to support the in-
sane policy of nuclear deterrence through constant
nuclear escalation, and in doing so emulate the great con-
servative philosopher, Phyllis Schlafly, who moronically
preaches: “The atomic bomb is a marvelous gift that was
given to our country by a wise God." (Boston Globe,
7/15/80). It is increasingly apparent that ingrained
ethnocentricity and myopic world views will be the
guiding light of our leaders at least for the next four
years.

Something Bertrand Russell once said bears repeating
at this time: “This idea of weapons of mass extermina-
tion is utterly and absolutely horrible; and it‘s a thing
that no man with one spark of humanity can tolerate. I
will not pretend to obey a government which is organizing
the massacre of the whole of mankind. We cannot obey
these murderersi Wicked and abominable, they are the
wickedest people that ever lived in the history of man,
and it is our duty to do what we can."

Enlightening and to the point, Russell’s words convey
the struggle for our time: to remove from power those
who tolerate nuclear weapons, and to remove the nuclear
Sword of Damocles that hangs over all humankind.

Turning away from the two established parties and in—
stead focusing on third parties, grassroots organizational
building, and non-violent action is the best way to change
our direction in the race towards nuclear disaster.

Regarding the nuclear policies of Mondale and Reagan,
it seems appropriate to again quote Russell: “To discuss
endlessly what silly people mean when they say silly
things may be amusing. but can hardly be important."

Darkness was my friend. I was
alone, speaking to the wind and
the evening air that was lit by
nothing save the stars of distant
galaxies and the glow of the moon
on the cosmic dust. I had had 3 vi-
sion earlier in my sleep. in the
recesses or my mind that are
unreachable by any other, within
that special area of the brain that
is an island unto itself, se-
questered from the prying of
others, from the jealous minds.

existance. l was along, solitary
without purpose save for the vi~
sion that had come.

The vision was a sign. neon on
the horizon of a cerulean colored
night’s sky. it flashed pulsating
barbs or light that cut through the
air and into my eyes. lwas blind
ed by the works. mesmerized by
the [lashing brilliance of the sign.
I stumbled back. The sign
screamed silently into the night.
He shielded my eyes from the
glare. and cried because I could
not understand. Instead it was
meaningless and oft times
unremembered.

It was awful. horrible. All of the
Street's wanderers had become
transfixed. and all stared at the
sign. worshipping it, bowing
down. Suddenly, I saw, They too
had misunderstood the Sign. I had
been blinded, so had they. I Watch

words of the prophets are written
on the subway walls and tenement
'halls. and whispered in the sounds
of silence.” Isuddenly know what
had to be done. I raced out into the
Crowd and screamed. “Look.
look! Look at the sign. Read it!”
But none would listen. “Go to the
subwaysl Go to the parks, the
mountains!"

But my words tell on deaf ears.
