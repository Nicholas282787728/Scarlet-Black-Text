cussed religious beliefs and goals,

InIerVarsity‘s guidebook, published by
the national organization, states that
members should view theireampuses as
“mission ﬁelds." Janice Lee explained
that her lntetVarsity membership kept
her from feeling “alone in my Christian-
ity" on campus. Others expressed Sll’lllr

lat sentiments. adding that the group
provides support for many,
