Gasoline prices tumble here

The average price ofa gallon of
serfrserve, regular gasoline here has
fallen below theS I-per»gallon mark
for the ﬁrst time in recent memory,
thanks in large part to a reduction in
demand and growing inventory lev»
els.

As ofTuesday morning, the av-
erage price per gallon for regular
unleaded gas stood at 98.9 cents.

The downward trend began in
January when, at midrmonth, the
statewide average was $1, 04 per
gallon according to a Jan. 15 sur-

- vey conducted by the Iowa Depart-
ment of Natural Resources.

At the time that survey was re—
leased, Grinnell’s prices were at
about $1.02 per gallon, which was
below the state average.

In December, the average price
was $1.17, which actually was 5
cents less than in November. IN
January 1997, the average stood at
31,35.

According to the DNR, gasoline
prices across the state began 1998
with continued movement toward
lower retail prices at the pump. In
January, the national inventory level
stood at 17 million barrels above
last year. National gasoline stocks
have continued to increase, in part

because of a signiﬁcant jump in
gasoline imports.

Fallingcmde-oilpricesalsohave
contributed to the retail price de-
cline, the DNR reported.

Sashi Goel, DNR energy ana-
lyst, said Iowa consumers are ex-
pected to continue to beneﬁt from
below average prices.

However, the market may tighten
if tensions between the UN. And
Iraq escalate further, Goel said.

Sheriff’s annual report for 7997:
burglaries up, vandalism down

Incidents of burglary and under- ‘

age alcohol possession increased in
Poweshiek County during 1997,
while theft and vandalism declined,
according to Sheriff John Griffin's
annual report.

Grifﬁn noted that the most serious
crime his ofﬁce dealt with during the

As punishing storms batter the West
Coast and the Southeastern United

ance, light.

We ran a small story last Monday
about January temperatures, and no
one was surprised to learn that
Grinnell ‘5 mean reading for the month
was a remarkable 6.9 degrees above
normal for the ﬁrst month ofany given
year. Grinnell averages amean of16.9
degrees; this year, it was 23.8 —— com-
paiatively balmy.

The big storms lashing the coasts
’and the warmer-than-normal readings
being experienced bythe Midwestand
Plains states are the result, according
to most meteorologists and climatolo-
gists, ofEl Niﬁo, the warm-waterphe-

past several months, and it's likely to
be talked about for some time to come.
While it’s shown some signs ofweak-

been one of the strongest on record,
and it’s probably going to be affecting
the weather for many more months.
And, ifit is succeed by a La Nina 7

For now, though, it appears that E]

suggest that the coming summer will
be a bit cooler than normal,just as this

So let's enjoy it while we can.

course ofthe year was the shooting
death of Island Schultz, 18, in June.

“I hope that is the last [homicide]
we have to cover in a long time.” the
sheriff said.

The sheriff‘s department handled
60 cases of burglary during 1997,
compared with 45 in 1996, but thefts
fell from 96 to 91 between 1996 and
1997, according to the report.

The department handled 645 calls
for service during the year and made
1 12 arrests.

Grifﬁn said that 1997 was “a very
busy year" for his department.

“We had a drop in some areas, but
an increase in our burglaries and in
the alcohol-related areas,“ he noted.
“We had an increase in the numberof
civil papers that were served by our
department.”

Grifﬁn added that the number of
prisoners increased by 23 from 1996.

There were eight trafﬁc fatalities
covered by the sherist department
during the year.

Also, the departmenttested 48per-
sons on the intoxilyzer at the
Poweshiek County Jail for alcohol-
related offenses such as OWI and
public intoxication. And, Grifﬁn said,
deputies made “a lot oftrips” to men-
talehealth and prison facilities to
transport patients or prisoners.

“I would like to thank the
Poweshiek County reserves for the
time that they put in for our de-
partment," the sheriff said. “They
work as volunteers with no pay. This
year they put in 1,275 hours, plus the
schooling they have to have to stay
certiﬁed as a reserve. Without the
help of these individuals we would
be putting in a lot of extra time."

Deputies Mike Shutts and Joel
VanderLeest split time being in
charge of the reserves, spending con~
siderable time in meetings and class«
room instruction, Grifﬁn added.

“Withouttheirtimeoverseeingthe
reserves, we would not have a re-
serve unit,” he said.

Everyone probably has fog sto~
ries to tell after a recent series of
dismal days. Hard to believe that
citizensincertainpartsoftheworld
live in constant fog.

One wonders about the emotional

health ofthose who live fog bound, -

for instance in London. England,
that purported fog center of the
world. “A foggy day, in London
town,” sang an old song. Probably
it’s that stiffEnglish upper lip. But
it also is reputed to give the English
that famed rose-petal complexion.

Most of us who deal with inter-
mittent fog admit that once the sun
shines through, we feel much bet—
ter, that our whole outlook im-
proves. And certainly research has
proved that light deprivation, in—
cluding the shorter days of mid
winter, contributes to depression.
One kind of treatment for that form
of depression is to increase light
exposure, even certain special kinds
oflight which are most efficient in
treatment.

Another aspect offog is the dan-
ger to those who must needs drive
in dense fog to reach their homes or
places of business, especially iftlte
fog comes during the early morite
ing hours or at dusk as it did several
times during that foggy week.

There’snotalotonecandounder
those circumstances except drive
carefully. One observer, however,
reported following an automobile
which was driving about 25 miles
an hour, creating another kind of
trafﬁc hazard for those which came
upon it suddenly. The driver prob-
ably was scared stiff of the driving
conditions.

At least we don’t have a Fogg
Bottom, the low-lying part ofWash-
ington, D.C., where the United
States State Department is located
on the deepest part ofthe original
swampland on which the nation’s
capitol was built. Some people fa-
cetiously use that ten-n to refer to
the whole of the United States gov-
emment.

Nor do we have foghorns blast-
ing in our ears as happens in areas
where boats at sea or on rivers are
at risk from other vessels.

Come to think ofit, maybe that’s
what we need when traversing high-
ways in really dense fog, condi-
tions in which one can see barely a
car’s length ahead. Could we deal
with a warning device ofsome sort
onthe front ends ofourcars? Rather
like the deer whistles some people
use to prevent colliding with an
errant deer?

Are you in a fog today‘.7 I am
much of the time.

Do you have a foggy notion?
Neither do I.

Watch out, here it comes again,
this time on little cat feet! Duck!

s

Lynda Close, on the other hand,
had an amusing aspect of those
foggy conditions; When the sun
ﬁnally did break through, what
should she observe on a snowbank
in her back yard but a snake sun-
ning itself.

It’s a sure sign of spring, she
remarked.

Could be, but it’s an original in
Around’s mind.
