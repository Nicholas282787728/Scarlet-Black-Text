Ordinances Show Concern
Over Alcohol—Related Fights

By Craig Wacker

The Grinnell city council re—
cently passed two new town ordi-
nances, both aimed at curbing un-
derage drinking. Police Chief Dan
Boyer cited alcohol-related ﬁghts
as a major fac4
tor in the
council’s deci-
sien.

claiming they had searchedfor a1-

The ﬁrst or
dinance states
that no one un-
der 21 may enr
ter an establish»
ment which
does more than
50 percent of its
business alcoA
hol-related.
This. according
LoBoyer,would
mainly effect
places like The
Bar. Duffy's, and Link’s. Also as
pan of the new ordinance, these
establishments would have to post
signs outlining the new policy re-
garding underage persons

The reasoning behind the new
ordinance, according to Boyer, is
an attempt to limit the amount of
alcohol-related altercations which

take place between underaged
people. Boyer added that the vast
majority of incidents take place
between persons under the age of
21 . Boyer did not want to point the
finger at this age group in particu-
lar. but stated that the statistics in
the town of Grinnell show it to be
accurate,

Roughly 15 ﬁghts occurred in
town last year. Of those, most
involved people who were both in
toxicated and under 21. Boyer fo-
cused on two particularly harsh in-
cidents where one youth had his
throat slashed, and another suf~
feted a broken nose. At a town
meeting, citizens were asked to
voice opposition or support for the
proposed ordinance According to
Boyer. no one turned up in opposi»
lion. Many of those who spoke for
the ordinance cited the alternations
as reason enough for a new guide-
line.

The second ordinance, stated
Boyer, will help enforce the ﬁrst

nance states that a person can be

stead of just refusing to sellalcohol
to a suspect person. shopkeepers
should now retain the ID and call
for police help When the police
arrive, they will either verify the
validity of the ID or arrest the
suspect, This new policy, added
Boyer, will prevent underage
drinkers from bypassing the first

ordinance.

Some confusion still exists as to
which businesses the ordinances
affect Jeff Phelps, owner of Ihe

the ordinance deals mainly with
places that sell alcohol to be con-

Cramped Dormitory
Conditions Plague
First—Year Students

By Denice Skelly

Overcrowding. a problem that
has plagued Grinnell in the past,
has returned again for the newiirst-
year students, Many students have
been placed in rooms originally
designed for fewer people,

One first-year student, Rusty
Wheeler. expressed his impression
of living in adoublc with two other
roommates,“lt’san inconvenience.
Ifallthreeofuswereintheroomall
of the time, we would go crazy"
Anatherﬁrst—yearsnrdemexpressed
his annoyance at being housed in a
double with two roommates, “You
can’t turn left or right with out
bumping into each when it's
cramped"

Upperclass students have also
voiced their opinions on the irony
of the situation. It appears to be

have a quota on the number of stu—
dents who wish to study abroad and
live off-campus Jennifer Krohn,
assistant dean of Student Affairs.
stated that various factors contrib-
uting to the current overcrowded

situation this year.

Last year there was a larger per-
centof students whostudied abroad
ﬁrst semester, rather than second,
This resulted in many sophomores
receiving singles last fall and con»
sequently not enough room for
upperclass students returning sec-
ond semester from studying abroad.

Because Griunell stresses a
slrongcampuscommunity,irlimits
the number of students able to live
off campus Krohn admitted, “We
were not as liberal with telling stu-
dents [live] offcampus this year.”

These factors, combined with
the absence of 1127 Park Street
(formerly OCCO housing), form
the overcrowding problem now
being experienced at Grinnell. The
1990 fall occupancy at Grinnell is
1096, while there are only 1063
spaces in the residence halls and
houses.

Student Affairs is currently
working to eliminate the over-
crowding problem at Griunell and
predicts that by late September to
early October there will be space
for all the students.
