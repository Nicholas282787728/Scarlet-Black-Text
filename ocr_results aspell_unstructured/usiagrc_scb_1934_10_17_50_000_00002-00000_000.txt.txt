THE NUMBERLESS HERD
"Where are the herd-books?"

So ask the swamped switch-board operators, the
heads of campus organizations whose duties re—
quire constant contact with a large portion of the
students, the scholars who wish to learn assign»
merits of professors who are new at Grinnell or
have changed their addresses since last spring.
And, incidentally, so does the staff of The Scarlet
and Black, which is expected to record in its
pages a hundred or so correctly spelled campus
names in each issue.

In explanation, the editors point out that the
student directory is rarely out earlier than this
time, inferring that the precedent of distributing
the books around the first of November is de-
iinitely and permanently established and that
nothing can be done about it.

That the editors of the directory know more
about their business than we do, is not to be argu-
cd. We do humbly suggest, however, that some
provision be made to draw up a temporary re-
cord of student residences which can be used un-
til thc directory is completed. A mimcographcd
copy of phone numbers and names as of the time
of the first official registration count might be
placed in each hall, cottage and office on the cam-
pus. If somewhat incomplete, the list could eas-
ily be added to and would serve nicely until the
herd-books could be distributed.

The herd-books themselves are, no doubt,
prepared and distributed as quickly as possible,
but the demand for a temporary substitute is too
great to be ignored.

PROSPERITY TO THE PEACEFUL

For centuries the major powers of the world
have fought for power and richesﬁand thc
culminating conflict of these endless years strug~
gle, the World War, has left them with unpre»
cedent poverty.

For a single century, more or less, four tiny
European nations have disdainfully sniffed the
smoke of nearby battles and watched their neigh»
bors slit each others throats, satisified with their
lot and undesirous of joining the struggle for
wealth and as a reward find themselves blessed
with prosperity in a world of want. -

Sweden, Denmark, Holland and Switzerland
——for these are the countries which ﬁnd themselv-
es in such ancnviable position—have profited im-
measurably by their pacifism. Sweden last engag<
ed in battle in 1814 when it campaigned against
the Danes in Hostein; with the exception of minor
colonial disturbances in Sumatra in 1873, Holland
has not participated in military activities Since it
attempted to restrain its revolting provinces from
setting up the new nation of Belgium 104 years
ago; and Switzerland has known no war since the
close of a period of civil strife in 1712.

It has not been for lack of opportunity that
these nations have evaded armed conflict, but it
has been the result of an intense desire for peace,
Apparently their stand has been a wise one, if
they can boast of genuine prosperity while their
neighbors have crushing debts to bear, economic
disintegration to overcome, and want on every
side.

‘SAVIOR' I-IITLER OPPOSED.

Ill dramatic scenes last Sunday, the world
was given proof that freedom has found one lane
defender in autocratic Germany. At least one
group of people has had the courage to oppose the
will of Hitler in his attempt to dictate to the Ger-
man Christians, their very religious beliefs.
Protestants in Germany are undergoing perse—
cution and violence beeause they choose to re-
main faithful to their principles of religious free—
dom.

In all parts of the country Protestant min—
istcrs courageously assailed the plans of Hitler
and Reichsbishop Mueller to establish a dictator-
ship of the state over the church. Thcy charged
that it was nothing more than an attempt of a few
powerful men to impress a fanatic scheme upon
the people. Their main objection is that the rul—
crs of the state will also be the rulers of the

church. In the words of a spokesman for the
opposition to the state church, “The Lord of the
Christian church is Christ, not Hitler.” For their
opposition, many ministers have been deposed and
imprisoned.

But in attempting to regulate the religion of
a vast people the Nazis have gone too far. Even
armed authority is of no avail. surely the great
work of Martin Luther in freeing the German
church from autocratic control is not to be set
aside to satisfy the desire of a few.men to be
able to control the destinies of a people. May the
German protestants continue to fight for the
religious freedom for which their forbearers strug-
gled and died, and may the day of their success
e hastened!

Other Opinions

COEDUCATION OR SEGREGATION'.’
(The Daily Illini)

“The absence of sexual and social pressure is an
intellectual advantage rather than a liability,” is the
listen-lent of President Marion Edwards Park of
Bryn Mawr in Time magazine defending separate col»
leges for women as opposed to cot—educational institutions.

President Park adds, “Segregation at the college age
doesn’t hurt a bit. It teaches an appreciation of each
other, sadly lackmg in women who have no chance to
see their sex in control."

Coeds, what have you to say in your own defense?
Since about three-fourths of the 350,000 college women
of this country attend coeducational institutions there
must be some factors in their favor.

It was just a century last spring since a settlement
was made in the wilderness at Oberlin, Ohio, for the
first institute of higher education in this country open to
women as well as men. One of its main objects was
“Ilie elevation of female character, by bringing within
the reach of the misjudged and neglected Sex all the in»
eructive privileges which have hitherto distinguished the
leading sex from theirs. Today there are
as many women as men stepping “daintily” and "minc-
il'igly" down the boardwalks of American colleges and
universities.

Authorities see the college in the classroom passing
through three stages. The first was the docile, is»that—
whatvyou—Wanted-me to say attitude. The second was the
post war defiance of authority, and now the best coeds
want is to carry on independent scholarly investigation
under faculty guidance,

The first assumption is that most coeds are sincerely
interested in securing a real cultural background, but
they are not going to miss their biological main chance.
In short, they are going to get their man and an educa-
tion, too.

One of the best endorsements for coeducation comes
from President Scott of Northwestern. “The success of
coeducation has been proved beyond debate. It might
point out also that up to date more serious consideration
has been given to the special educational needs of women
in coeducational than in the separate colleges, which have
been afraid to give up the traditional standard course
devised for men."

It was also found that at Oberlin college there was
a tendency for the men to drop, or to relax their efforts
in, the cultural subjects in which the girls especially
excelled because they could not stand the feeling of inferi-
ority or discouragement. Coeds are bringing a challenge
ﬁcmetimes an uncomfortable challenge—into their work.

And as for the coed's point of view we have the
statement from an interesting person at the University of
Chicago who had this idea: “Men in the classroom are
a stimulation. You see, I’m in the ptemedical course,
and as a matter of fact I met my fiance in the Iaboratary.
We cut up caE together every day and dance every night
—excepi when we go to the movies or operations at the
hospital. I never was so happy in my life,”

The main question of worth between the two types
of education seems to be whether it is more vital for a
woman to adjust herself in the man's world, the coeduca—
Lional institun'on, and thus learn how to mingle in the
real world, or to develop her personality and abilities in
woman’s college and thus prepare for a career.

CLASSROOM TEAM an 1mm
(Saturday Review of Literature)

The academic news»item that we have never yet
seen in the newspaper runs like this:

The classrooms at Nutrix university have been hit
hard by graduation. At least four A men am lost from
English 35 and Instructor Frogbones says the whole
spearhead of his rhetoric attack is blunmd. In mathee
matics ensemble things are even worse: "Hypo" Cobe
boon, one of the greatest performers in calculus who ever
faced a blackboard, leaves a wide-open gap, and the
class in analytic functions dismayed the college by grad-
uating enmasse. A whole new unit will have to be
built. In classics also many a shift will be necessary
next season. Cat (“Catullus”) Scansio, three-year vete
eran in Latin lyrics, is gone and replacements will be
hard to find. The front row of the economics seminar
is swept away, including Biceps Jorgensen, the big
Swede who who was a tower of strength in Commercial
Paper. Similar foreboding is felt in Professor Phil-pic’s
class in Advanced Composition. His outstanding perform»
ers with gerund and predicate have left the old campus
and next fall’s material does not look promising. The
alumni are universally despondcnt.

HARVARD vs. HITLER
(The Daily Northwestern)

Is men or the state supreme? Harvard university
attempted to answer this question this week when it
refused to accept a German traveling scholarship.

Dr. .7. B. Conant, president of Harvard, stated that
the offer was refused on the fact that a gift could not
be accepted from a political machine which damaged
its universities by expelling intellectual persons from
the country because of racial or political differences.

In this country we feel that the welfare of all mans
kind should come before that of the skate. It is the in—
vcntions that benefit everyone, regardless of race or
creed, that have made their inventors most famous.
Would we have expelled Edison or Morse had they held
beliefs different than ours? Had we done so, the Unit—
ed States would not stand where it now does. These
men have hclpcd everyone, and they had no mind [or the
state whcn they first conceived the incundcsccnt lamp
and the telegraph.

We rcjoicc to see that the Ideas of liberty on which
this country was built are still in the minds of the intel—
ligent men and women, and We trust that our
idea of freedom of thought will enable us to continue to
honor and welcome great thinkers as wc have done in
the past.

“East and West." A collection of
short stories by Somerset Maugham.
This is a group of stories written in
the post war period and containing
some titles which you will immediately
recognize. “Rain,” the name of the
late Jeanne Eagles’ greatest dramatic
success, is the title of the first story.
“The Alien Corn,” which furnished
Katherine Cornell with the vehicle
for a long Broadway run two years
ago. is another. That these stories
lend themselves so readily to dram~
atization is ample proof of their vivid—
ness and action. Even if you can
only read a few of the stories in this
volume they will probably refresh
you after a prolonged diet on the
usual mediocrity of the American

magazine short story.

“Man’s Fate" by Andre Malraux.
Winner of the Goncourt prize for
1933, In spite of the impressive title,
this is a really gripping book. It is
the story of a revolution in young,
half-Europeanized China and the way
in which it affects the lives of a
group of young intellectuals as well
as the foreign concessionaircs. From
books like ”Man's Fate” and “The
Good Earth” a greater understanding
of the Chinese character may be gain~
ed than in any other way accessible
to most of us. And it is rather im»
portant that we know something about
China because surely in Star is in the
ascent. This is a book which, if you
are interested in the worldwide view
of youth toward actual and impending
rcvoluton, will interest you greatly.

"Village Tale" by Phil Stong. This
book by a native Iowan has been
available since last spring. It is the
story of a small Iowa town, and it
tells its tales of the loves, the jealous»
ies, the cruelties of the closely intere
related lives of these people. This is
the sort of story which is relaxing in
its compass of small things, yet vitally
interesting in is tracing of the life
currean which are universal to all
men of town and city alike, If you
like Phil Stong's style, and who among
the mid-Westerners do not, you’ll en—
joy this successor to ”stranger‘s Re-
tum.”

Gordon Takes First Place

as Pioneer Harriers Lose .

Tom Gordon, student cross country
manager, won first individual horors
as Grinnell lost its opening hill-aw-
dale contest to the Carleton barriers
last Saturday by a 9 to 13 score. The
visiting runners placed second, third,
fourth, and sixth in the one and one-
hali mile run while Arnold Hagen,
and George M'arker, placed, fifth, and
seventh, respectively, for (irinncll.

Gordon states that plans are being
rounded into shape [or the current
cross country season. The first of a
series of about five races will be held
Thursday afternoon at 4:30. This con
test will be open to varsity and non~
varsity men alike, and anyone inter~
csted is welcome to enter, Gordon
says.

After the initial race in the series,
runners will be given handicaps ac—
cording to their ability. Five ribons will
be amarded for each race after the
conclusion of the intramural cross
country program, membership to the
Cross Country club will be granted
to those who have proved their ability.

Tentative arrangements have been
made for varsity meets on Nov. 3, 10,
and 24. Coe, Comell and Drake will
probably form the opposition accord»
ing to Gordon,
