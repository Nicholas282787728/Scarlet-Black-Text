General Reception.

One of the most pleasant social
events of the year is the general
reception held during the ﬁrst
week of school. The reception at
the Rand gymnasium last Satur~
day evening was no exception to
this rule.~ New students, old stu-
dents and faculty entered into the
spirit of the occasion with a vigor
which effectively excluded the
cold formality usually associated
with conventional receptions.

The arrangements of the com-
mittee were admirably adapted to
produce the best result. The “old
boys take new girls and old girls
new boys” system which was in-
augurated last year with such suc.
cess, was again followed. This
was reinforced by the "I am, who
are you?” cards. which greatly
facilitated the remembering of
names. The main room of the
gymnasium and the anterooms
were prohrscly decorated in scars
let and black, ‘rappe was served

 

at intervals and proved very res
treshing in spite ot the coolness
of the evening.

The song by the glee club was
so greatly appreciated that they
were compelled to respond again,
but the most vociferous applause
did not induce them to give still
another selection. The glee club
is always heard with pleasure. and
though rather reduced in numbers
at the beginning of the year, still
retainsrnuch of its old-time power.
It was a great pleasure to the old
students to see so many or the
class of root) present at the recepr
tion. Before adjourning for their
class reunion they showed the true
spirit by giving their class yell
and the college yell together.

All will admit that, besides atr
fording a very pleasant evening,
the reception ot Saturday thorr

oughly accomplished \its purpose.

. introducing the new students
into college life and making the
oldstudentsacquaintedwiththose
who have come to Grinnell for the
ﬁrst time. The mutual helptulness
of college lifeis greatly stimulated
by these early acquaintances.
which often ripen into decided
triendships.
