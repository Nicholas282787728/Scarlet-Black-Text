a beautiful Friday altemoon in April
and 100 secondrgrade students at
Fairview Elementary School recreat»
ing a traditional Arbor Day ceremony
by planting‘ﬁve crabapple trees in a
semircirclearoundadriveoutsidetheir
school building.

It was a scene reminiscent of a
Norman Rockwell illustration.

The ceremony was complete with
remarks from the mayor, shared in-
formation from the children and the
adults about why trees are important.
the proper way toplanta tree and, more
importantly how to take care ofit so it
will thrive and grow,

Another notable part of this equa-
tion were members of the Grinnell
High School FFA chapter who ﬁrst
dug holes in the rich black dirt, then
lifted the trees out oftheir ten-gallon
containers into the holes and helped
the second graders plant the trees.
Their interest and enthusiasm were
infectious and their strong arms in-
valuable.

The only thing missing was a copy
ofJoyce Kilmer’spoem “Trees“ which
Malissa Juni, a Fairview teacher, lo-
cated nearthe end of the ceremony and
which will be shared with the students
back in their classrooms this week as
they review their treerplanling experi-
ence, says Saral-legg—Dunne, Fairview

New study adds weight to
global-warming argument

Many people still regard talk about global warming as a Chicken Litile talc,
arguing that there’s no ﬁrm evidence ofthe phenomenon, Doubiers may be
taken aback by a new study released last week by a geosCicnces professor at
the University of Massachusetts who, with his colleagues, noted that three
years this decade have been the warmest since Christopher Columbus landed
in America.

According to Prof. Michael Mann and his colleagues, who published their
study in the journal Nature, I997, 1995 and I990 were among the wannest-
ever years in the Northern Hemisphere since climatological data ﬁrst wcre
recorded. They added that the likely culprit is the rising level of greenhouse
gases, long thought to contribute toward the global-warming phenomenon

The Associated Press reported that the researchers “reconstructed annual

average temperatures back to the
year 1400 and found no your
warmer than those three." How did
the rcscarchcrs determine climate
for along pcrlod during which no
scientiﬁc instrumentation existed
for recording temperatures? They
based their computations on such
things as old tree rings, coral and
ice. And, of course, there were'some historical records to plumb as well ——
written information that chronicled climate.

Some might not ﬁnd the data all that alarming. After all, both I997 and
1995 were warmer than average only by 09 degree. But that is greatly
signiﬁcant in climatological terms, Mann, who currently holds a postr
doctoral fellowship that‘s ﬁnanced by the Energy Department, said past
temperature spikes have resulted largely from solar phenomena and volcanic
eruptions, the more recent increases are largely the result ofgascs generated
by fossil fuels and trapped in the atmosphere. According to Tom Karl ofthc
National Climatic Data Center, Mann's study represents “another indication
that it seems quite likely that the increase in greenhouse gases is contributing
to the very warm conditions we see now."

People who follow this sort ofthing will recall that the government
announced in January that 1997 was, ill global terms. the warmest year on
record in the last century.

Statistical aberrations? That’s what some will argue, But it’s becoming
clearer all the time that this isn’tJust a matter ofa bunch ofalamiists pretlictr
ing doom. Global warming is real, and unless worldwide cffons are under-
taken to slow the trend, there is indeed cause for alarm.

The Mann study is only the latest evidence. Tliere'll be more to come.

 

 

Sub-zero sensations

Hypnotist Chip Flatow's words pushed temperatures in the Community
CenterTheatre far below zero Saturday night for some ofthose assembled,
andlack Marcum and EllieArseneault huddled togetherfor warmth,They
were two of the dozen or so "subjects" of Flatow’s show, which was
sponsored by the We Care After Prom Committee to underwrite the
hypnotist's 3 am, performance atthe1998 After Prom Party. According to
Diana Clay,one ofthe organizers,approximately 295 youths attended the
party. Committee members start working in February to round up the
donations by parents and businesses which help make the event success—
ful: this year, $1,000 worth of"ear|y bird” prizes helped get students to the
party, and another $3,000 worth of grand prizes distributed at 5 am
encouraged them to stay til the end.
