Tuesday, December I at the post office and
during dinner at the dining halls. In order for a

INITIATIVE #I:

Background

Throughour eainpus, people eoinplain abour rhe rood serviees. Reeenrly rhcsc eoinplainrs
have been abour rhe laele orrespouse ro eommenrs abour Dining serviees, Prcvlously, rhere
have been objeerions abour roreed board plans, unreasonable prrees, lirnired meal rues, and
laek orrood oprlons.

Initiative Statement

The dining opuons available on rhe required board plan are laeking We need ro make
more oprions available, borh in rhe meal plan purehased, in rhe food eaten. and rhe rimes
food is accessible There is no reason rhar rhe services eannor be changed ro he more suired
m rhe desires ofeampus.

Plan of Action

we should eombine rhe sei-viees or rhe Forum cull , Bobs, Quad, and cowles, unired
all on one card inro whieh we eould add monies ro our board plan. we also should ehange
rhe prising, so rhar insread orgiving a lump sum orinoney for a eerrain number ormeals,
one would paya lump sum ornaoney rhor would be rhoughr oras money, like an aeeounr, lr
could be used ro pay for food anywhere on eampns, and rhe balanee in rhe aeeounrwould be
reduced an equivalenr amounr. A menu, mueh like rhe one now, bur more aeeiirare and
evrensive, would be available ro know wherher oi- nor earing in rhe dining hall would be
worrhwhile. There is already such a sysrem or use an rhe Forum, and rhe dining halls already
deduer rhings orrour board plan, The priees for meals are already ser, alrhough rhey may
have re be raised slighrly beeause now people would be using 100% orehe meals rhey were
charged (or.

This would give added ﬂexibility ro earing rimes and plaees, so rhar someone eould ear
yogurr roe breakrasr ar rhe rorum everyday wirhour running our ormoneyhalrway through
rhe semesrer, or luneh 2r. rhree o'clock in the arrernoon. rr would also make rhe board meal
plan oprlons inrinirely more variable, beeause you wouldn't have ro guess how many meals'
you wanred ro ear per week, bur eould ear when you were hungry, and ﬁnd susrenanee
elsewhere when you didn’t like whar was being served in rhe dining hall rhar day.

Alternate Plan of Action

Make available rhe meals to groceneo plan ro everyone, rarher rhar just srudenr groups
and professors. Add everyday oprlons, like a Past: Bar. Open rhe dining halls, very shorr
srarred, (or longer rime periods (an extension orrhe Expresses)

Have more response ro eommenr eards (like roorbeer insread orCarreine Free Dler Cokei
or or leasr an answer as ro why nor)

Lower rhe eosr orForum Food

Raise rhe number orpoinrs for rhe Expresses

Clearrcutring roresrs wlrh rrees up ro 2,000 years old, possibly eonralnlng hundreds, even
rhousands orspeeies orplanrs and animals, is absoluiely unneeessary and unaeeeprable. As
we srare in rhe iniriarive sraremenr, only 20% orrhe world’s aneienr roresrs remain, and only
4% orrhe U.S.’s remain. our anelenr forests are lmporranr for biodiversiry, for air quality,
for vorer oualiry, for remperarure regularion, and daey serve as spirirual eenrers erroeus for
people aeross rhe world. Campaigns aeross rhe globe are arrempring ro srop rhe selling urold
growrh wood, in rhe hopes orelosing rhar marker, and several eolleges in rhe unired smres
have begun similar proeesses. we would like Grinnell college lo join rhein

Initiative Statement

we rhe srudenrs ororinnell College believe rhar our eore value orsoeial responsibiliry
and aerion neeessirares rhar GrinneII adopr a poliey prohibiring rhe purehase urold growrh
wood produers. old growrh logging is desrruerive ro rhe global environmenr arid ro indig-
enous eulrures Less rhan 20% orrhe world's aneienr roresrs are lerr, and approximately 4%
orrhe u.s.'s aneienr roresrs remain considering rhese raers, we believe ir is our resonsibiliry
ro invesrigare our purehasiag policies ro ensure rhar we no longer eonrribure ro rhis dcsrruc-
rion,

elude inveseigaring all orour wood and paper purehases ro see whar kind orwood rhey are
made from, and pledging ro diseonrinue any eonrraers wiih eompanies who supply us wirh
