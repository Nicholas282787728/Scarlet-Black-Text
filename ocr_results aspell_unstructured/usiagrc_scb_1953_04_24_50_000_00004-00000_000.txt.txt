Grinnell's' powerful tennis

team, undefeated in three meets
through April 23, will entertain
a dangerous Carleton squad next
‘Pridoy on the local courts.

' Last year the Carla downed
;the Pioneers, 4-3, in a dual meet
lat Northfield, with Bob Dibblc,
‘Midwest conference singles
champ, not playing. in the con—
,ierence meet, however, the cat-ls
liinished second behind Grinnell.

Pacing the Carleton squad
are sophomore Bruce Ohinann,
runner-up to‘Dib'ole last year,
and senior Jon Nutting.

The Scarlet & Black will
also be attempting to continue
their shutout mastery over their
toes. The Pioneers have yet to
‘lose a single match in con-
ference competition this year.
They have shut out both Coe
and Knox by 9-0, and 74)
scores.

Coach Piitsch believes, that
his forces “stand a good chance
to continue their record of
shutouts," but he also added
that "Carleton will be a much
tougher sound than either Coe
or Knox. They are probably our
toughest conference foe Sinoe
we don’t face Lawrence in a
dual meet."

Pﬁisch expects to send against
the Carls the same five men'
that have 'Can‘ieﬁ Grinnell to
victories in their openers. They
are in the singles, Bob Dibble,
conference champ for two years,
Bill Hamilton, Harry Young,
John Young, and Pred‘Lime.
Dibble and Hamilton, and Young
and Young will form the
doubles teams. All five of these

 

men are lettermen.

Fans who like to watch track and who like to see Grinncll
athletic teams_win, will get a chance to do both next Wednesday
night when Simpson invades Ward field. It'll be the only home
meet this season, and it'll be worth watching,

With the arrival of warmer weather, Coach Eooth's prote es
are rapidly getting into top shape, as practice times indicate. or
example, last Monday in a practice _440 yard 11m, five men were
bunched so closely together at the finish that only six tenths of a
second separated the first and fifth men—the winning time was
52.2\seconds, not bad for early in the season.

Tuesday’s meet between Central's varsity and the Pioneer
frosh could be even more interesting from the spectator point-
ofevlew than the Simpson dual, since the Tuesday meet should toe
very Close. Several of the fresh have been performing as well or
better than the varsity in some events.

Coach Pfitsch's ra’cketmen established themselves as one of
the midwest'stop small college tennis teams by downing Omaha
yesterday, Third member of the Midwest conference to face the
deadly Pioneer 'axe will be Carleton next Friday on the loca1
court, The last Carl team which visited Grinnell was the basket-
ball Squad last February—it got trounced I think that another
Carleton team is going to get smashed next Friday.

Next winter’s basketball game with iowa State will be the 52nd

whelming, 5; to ll, score in 1908. The Cyclones must be worried~
they're having spring practice! ‘
