PUGPUPS.

Now that sundry matters have been taken care of
through the effdrts of embryonic editors, the old force
returns to the task of reforming the World and Grinnell
in particular. A desire to organize an associction or
"Pugpups" in Grinnell liES close to our heart. The name
finds its derivation from the Pick up Glass, Pick up Pe-
per Society, recently organized at a. school in England
in an attempt to interest the young generation of school
pupils in the tidiness of the countryside. If the Plig‘
pups are justifying their organization by the achievement
of a purpose, we are Wishing either that Gi‘inneli stu—
dents once belonged to this famous society, or else that
they unofficially organize immediately. The layer 0!
debris which has been hidden by the daily 01' weekly
snowstorms during the past few" months has at last been

brought by the spring thaw. Reminders of everything
from gum wrappers to omnge peels blurt out at the pub

lic while crossing the campus, cspcciully around the
dormitories.

The rule prohibiting students from inking food from
the dining room seems to have little or no effect on the
amount of refuse thrown from windows. A feeling of
personal pride and cleanliness should mitigate against
a practice of dumping waste paper and rciuse from the
windows.

TIIE QUESTION OF SENIOR. FINALS

Without introduction let it be stated decisively that
we fire opposed to a sentiment and ruling of the college
Lidiiiinistrittiun that all seniors shall he required to mks
second semester final examinations except those who
are specifically exempted by the class instructor in the
course. We believe this rule to be illrfounded, and shall
make every effort to obtain a. reconsideration of the
matter.

Perhaps the members of the editorial board, being
seniors, may be said to be biased. Whether affected
with senior prejudices or not, we (eel that we reprer
sent not only the senior class, but every other class in
this institution when we voice our opinions on this
question. Every student, he he freshman or junior, has
been immersed sufficiently in the routine stream of col-
lege life to become aware or the specific ohjctions which
may he legitimately raised against second semester
finals for the graduating class.

To reverse the order of things, let us ask the dues
Lion: Why should seniors be required to take these
eraminzitions‘.’ Upon inquiry we receive the answer that
unless seniors are forced to write these tests, their
presence becomes harmful to the general morale of tlle‘
campus. We are told that seniors must be disciplined
during these last few months (two, in fact) in school
in order that the remaining six hundred members of the
college community shall not he led astray by any demr
unstration of concerted idless and frivolity, This is the
reason given for misting examinations upon seniors

No other rescon can he given. Surely these examin-
ations are of no use to instructors in determining
Whether the senior shall pass or fail. The status 01 one
so far along in his college Work is quitc completely tix-
ed. No senior will ordinarily be demoted because of
failure in this final quiz. Every instructor knows full
well that the "mad dance" of {ire-graduation days in~
evitahly means less attention given to studies. He does
not expect as much of his senior students as previously.
\Vhy, then, in View of this insert this anomaly, final ex—
aminations? '

It the college wishes to graduate ﬂ, class which will
be filled with Grinnell pride and enthusiasm, let them
be somewhat concerned as to the general atmospherel

surrounding the class during these few remaining weeks _

of school. Suppose a small decline in scholastic stand-
ards among the seniors does oncnriand We question
even this. Will any great sacrifice on the part of the
college result? It seems to us that Grinnell is sufficient-
ly scrupulous already in matters of formAclasses, sched-
ules, cuts, Lind all the rest#it need fear no important
loss in removing the bothersome final examination from
the hectic path of seniors. Much would he gained in

good feeling.
