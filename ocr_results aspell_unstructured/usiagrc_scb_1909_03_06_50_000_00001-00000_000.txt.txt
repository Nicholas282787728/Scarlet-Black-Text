Alumni and Faculty appearing on the
program. together with one represent
ative 1mm each of the men’s literary
societies,

The attendance was not especially
large and was limited largely to the
membership of the societies. It had
been hoped that more interest would
be shown by the townspeople and those
students outside the membership. but
the interest among those present more
than balances any defects in attend-

some investigation and study and good
analytical power.

movement. He suggested that such
movements as this were evidences or
an awakened interest among Collage
