AT LAST

E have seen a really in~

triguing' atomizer, one
that combines usefulness with
loveliness. The base is large
enough to make it stand up-
right under the most tipsy
conditions, and the bottle
small enough to hold just the
right amount of that perfume
which you "simply adore” but
ot w ich you can afford only
a thimblerlull at a time. Its
loveliness depends on its mods
emistic designing. The bulb
is placed must surprisingly
and is connected with the
bottle by a long shiny tube.
The bottle itself is of dell-
cately tinted glass and hangs
gracefully- from the top of the
tube.

And while speaking of at-
omizers, we really teel that
we should not neglect to
mention those which sproc-
one's tin-oat and relieve that
awful cold. They may not be
as beautiful as the others, but
we are sin-e that they give as
much pleasure. Find your
atomizers at Muthews' Drug
Store.

JUST PLENTY NIFTY
ARE the suggestions for
c ’tmas gifts t h at
S’I‘OAKS' have to offer, but
niftiest of all is the new sta-
tionery. They just got it in
yesterday, and honestly. I've
never seen such a varied, yet
tasteful selection in all my
lite, lilodernistic boxes, big
folders with blottcrs and all
the other accessories, tassel»
ed boxes, on every kind to
suit anyone whom you think
ought to accept the gentle
hint to write more often.

THE GRANDEST TIME
I EVER had was the other
day when i went into get
this ad. 1 tell you, when i
stepped into BARCLAY’S I
looked around wondering
what to write up when i saw
a whole big rack full of
Christmas candy. There it
was, most of it in bulk in
great huge bushel containers
with lids on. After peeking
under all ot the lids 1 surrey»
Litiously swiped a big piece
of hard candy and had‘ a ter-
rible time eating it before
they discovered me. There
is also boxed candy to suit
the king or the gi -f 'end,
but take it from me, BAR~
CLAYS is the place to go.

A WREATH

A‘T just radiates Merry

Christmas is entwined
with those pretty little light
bulbs. One hanging in your
room is guaranteed to give as
much cheer as a yule log.
Get the bulbs at Birohnrd's.

ONCE a YEAR

FTER the tears have been

wiped away following the
Yulerlog service, and the
cocoa has been made by a
bothered social chairman, the
cottage has its Christmas
party, Along with the cocoa,
however, comes the gifts, but

purchase a ten cent gift for
the owner of said moniker.

gling, trying to ﬁnd one, just

for this occasion, and you
might ﬁnd something for kid
brother when you’re down
there too.

“DO YOU SUPFDSE
I COULD," and then you
stop, afraid of saying those
last fatal words. Again you
begin, rather coyiy this time,
“Do you suppose by any pos<
sible chance that I could—-
charge this and pay you after
Christmas?" Then profuse ex~
planations as to the flatness
of the pocketbook follow. But
of course you can charge it,
TALBOTT'S have just one
more big attraction in the
smile and nod that follows
the question, “Charge it to
Dad?”
