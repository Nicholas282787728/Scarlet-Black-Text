Collins, Rigney Will Lead
1933 Grid Eleven

(Sperm lo The Stdrlcl and Black)

STILLWATER, OlliemFar the
first time in history, so far as old-
timers can recall, an Oklahoma Aggie
grid squad will have co-ceptains next
fall.

When the balloting for captain ic
suited in a tie between a lineman and
a back, the cc-captain plan was de-
cided upon. As a result Carl Rigncy,
end, and Merle Collins, halfback, will
share the honors as Cowboy leader
in 1933.

29 Letterman -

0f the 29 football letter-men na .
ed by Coach Lynn 0. Waldorf, 13
are seniors, leaving the Cowboy men-
tor with a nucleus of 16 letter-men
around which to build his 1933 grid
team.

Of the remaining 16, 12 are line-
men and four are backs, making it
appear that waldorf's problem next
fall will be to build a backfield, the
reverse of this fall's situation when
linemen were most in demand.

Bnckﬁcld n Problem

Bdcl'ﬁeld lettcrmen available next
fall w be Hall, Rosette, Allen and
carcaptztin Collins; two fullbacks, a
quarter, and a half.

Linemcn with letters who are ex-
pected to be available in 1933 include:
G. Dupree, Clinkenheard, Riggs and
Wolford, guards; Porter, Tichenor
and Cheney, tackles; Bruner, co-
captain, ey, Jenkins and Haf-
tarth, ends and List, center.
