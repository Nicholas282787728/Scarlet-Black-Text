Barriers Down - -

0n the bulletin boards of the halls and
cottages is posted this simple notice: “I
approve of the sending of relief boxes to
individuals in Germany and Austria.” Be-
low the notice is space for signatures.

Comparatively few persons have signed
this statement. Perhaps it is time to point
out that signature in no way commits one
to any action, but is merely an expression

of sentiment.

Today, the mails to Austria and Ger-
many are not open. A private individual
in this country may not send packages to
relatives or friends in these countries“
though he may know that these relatives
and friends are suffering terribly. Neither,
may the American Friends Service Com-
mittee work, in Germany, and only recently
were they admitted to Austria. Some re-l
lief is being administered by UNRRA, but
the opening of mail channels and the ad-
mission of American Friends into Germany
would further alleviate the suffering.

After you have signed the relief state» .
ment, it will be sent to headquarters of
American Friends, who will use this ex—
pression of public opinion in their fight to
get through the barriers to the cold and
hungry people.

Comment In Passing - -

Student wages at Northwestern univer-
sity average about 60 cents an hour. At
Washington university, students may work
only six hours a week, but they earn more
in that time than a Grinnellian earns in
twelve hours. Well?

A. R. H. Art Exhibit - —

We note with amusement the huge and
aweeinspiring ”No Smoking” signs which
have blossomed overnight in the corridors
of ARH. Perhaps we have been blind, but
we have seen little or no smoking in the
hallsiand if there has been, we’d be willing
to su ar that the building ,is fire proof. The
artistic signs however, add variety in the
cold and dreary halls, and offices are better‘
smokers anyway. '

Classic Remark of This Semester:
» One of our returning vets was
loudly hailed by a certaln His-
tory professor early in the sev
mester. The prof, remembering
that the vet had been here years
ago asked whether he’d been priv-
ileged to have him in class inl
days gone by. “No," came the
reply. “but I once audited one,
of your classes.” When the prof
expressed his inability to recall
when that might have been, the
vet quietly replied: "I sat in
the classroom jus: below yours!”
