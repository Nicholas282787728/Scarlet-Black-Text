Ordinances Suggest
Anti-Student Intent

The city of Grinnell recently
passed a new ordinance that pre-
vents individuals under the age of
21 from entering any establishment
that receives more than 50 percent
of its revenue from the sale of alco
hol-relaled products. But preventA
ing underage drinking is not the issue. It seems as if the intent of the
ordinance is to discourage college students from socializing in town.

According to Police Chief Dan Boyer, the new policy was passed in
order to prevent ﬁghts in town and to keep high school students out of the
local bars. Yet, adequate enforcementof the lX-yearentrance requirement
would have been sufﬁcient to achieve these goals,

Thus, to many students, this decision appears to be a vindictive
measure to limit student-town interaction, especially at The Bar, The Bar.
in particular, has been a social place, where students would go to buy
pizza,play pool,orjusttaikaftermostotheraltemativeplaees were closed.

College students are as much a part of the town of Grinneil as any other
residents. We purchase products from local busioness, and some of us
excerise our voting rights here Thatwe are from diverse locations and are
here for only pan of the year does not mean we should be conﬁned to
campus. The new ordinance smacks of an “us-vs-them“ mentality that
may increase tension between the town and college communities,

Scarlet and Black
Clarifies Its Policies

Toclarify theScarletartdBlac/z’s
role on campus, and editorial poli-
cies, we publish the following for
our readers:

The Scarlet andBlack is an open
fomm for discussion of campus is-
sues. The opinion page is open to
submissions in the form of letters to the editor. Any student. faculty
member, administrator or other member of Grinneii’s community may
submit a letter. ’

All submissions shall be edited for four criteria: First, they shall be
edited for spelling and grammatical errors Second, all letters shall be
edited for space. When there is a limited amountof space, some letters
mustbe shoncned. The third and founh rationales forediting are forlibel
and matters of “poor taste," If, after careful and lengthy discussion of the
editorial staff of the Scarlet and Black, any statement is found to be “in
poor taste" (such as a personal attack), it will be removed.

Although the Scarlet and Black is a forum for public opinion and
commentary, it is not a bulletin board. it is not the responsibility of the
newspaper to include announcements of upcoming events and meetings,
The staff would like to differentiate its work from the Campus Memo.

The final clariﬁcation that should be made concerns the staff editorial
which is run without a byline because it represents the opinion of the
Scarlet and Black staff. Not every sraff member may agree with the
opinion, but it represents a clear majority.

These clarifications result from the staff‘s desire to brieﬂy outline the
editing process and the new changes to its policies. Most imponantly, the
Scarlet and Black is published to serve the college community, and will
therefore try, to the best of its ability, to include the disparate opinions that
exist on this campus.

APATHY: Should SGA Be More
Politically Active? Who Cares?

continued from page S

to organize a demonstration in
opposition. The vast majority of
students do not frequent the BCC
and would have very little to lose
with its elimination. Nevenheless,
the Concerned Black Students
should be able to count on support
from other student groups and
students at large if they were to
organize a sit-in outside of Nollcn
House in protest. And we're not
talking about the standard under-
50-students sitrin. We’re talking
about true campus unity, about
helping each other out, about
protesting effectively.
SGAisinarutl Werecognizcit,
admit it, and want to change iL
Currently, if an unpopular policy
takes effect SGA can send a letter
of protest. mectwtth theappropriate
administrators, perhaps organize a
poorly-attended Open Forum and

do little more than hope for
benevolentclemency. Beyond the
point of the Open Forum, when
Drakesays.“l’msorry,butmymind
is made up,"wearepar-alyzed. SGA
cannot push the matter any more
because we can’t prove that we
have student support The College
administration knows that The
administrationcounts on that. They
simply have to be patient and wait
things out. We can‘t say we blame
them. They are being rational, in a
Machiavellian sort of way.

We will hold an Open Forum
this Monday night (September 24)
at 7:30 pm. in South lounge in
order to open up a free-ﬂowing

discussion on the matter of how we_

can obliterate student apathy on
campus, on how SGA can improve,
on how itcan be used as an effective
resource on campus, on how it can
help students and student
organizations help each other. It

will take effort, of course, but as
someone with a turn grasp of the
obvious once said, “Nothing
worthwhile is ever easy."

Apathy is easy. What we are
envisioning will takea lot of energy
on the panofSGA, to be sure. But,
more importantly, it will take
energy, and a certain amount of
sacriﬁce, from all ofyou. Are you
willing to work with us? We think
youcan. The administration loiows
you can't We‘ll see who's right
this Monday night,
