Shot Put by Throwing Ball
43 Feet 111/2 Inches.

In the biggest upset of the day,
Rinefort failed to quality in the discus
tin-ow when he louled on all of his
long tosses. After setting records at
both the Texas and Kansas relays, his
failure to show at the Drake classic
was a big disappointment, lie man-
aged to qualify in the shot event,
however, when he shoved the brass
ball is feet, 11 1-2 inches.

Laird came through the Friday's
events in line shape, mahing a 181 foot
throw, which is his best this season.

Contestants Number 2500

with more than 2,500 contestants
and the promise of the best day in
years to perform. the Drake relays
should be marked by record smashing.
Due to the brilliant running of Con-
ger, and the speed of his team mates,
Caulum, Witmer and Thornburg, the
Ames boys created a new world's rec-
ord in the two mile medley relay. The
time was 3:3.2. Calum ran a half in
1:53}, Witmer and Thornburg unar-
ters in 51 and 51.1 respectively and
Captain Conger ran the mile in 4:217.

Farley of Missouri made the best
time in the century with a mark of
9.8 seconds. Hermason of Northwesb
ern turned in the second best time
with 9.9 seconds.

Knnsas blokes Record

The Kansas sprinters created ane
other record when they covered the
quarter mile relay in 41.x, seven tenths
of a second below the former record.
Iowa university. running in the same
heat, also went below the existing
mark.

There is much interest shown in the
special events this afternoon. shimek

but will be pitted against such men as
Oslf, Haskell Institute, and Frazier.
of Kansas, who will make the race ln~
teresting. Frazier received his prep
school training under Watt, the new
Grinnell football mentor.

Ames is expected to do well in the
two mile relay where Caulum and
Conger. two of the fastest half-milers
in the Valley are competing under
Iowa state colors. The Cyclones cov-
ered the distance in 7:53 at Kansas.

Iowu Mlle Relay Favorite

Iowa university is doped to win its
favorite event, the mile relay, With a
squad which may do better than 5:20,
it looks like the class of the meet.
Cuhel. one of the fastest tracksters in
the western conference, is anchor
man. Baird, also a member or the
team, has a record of better than 50
seconds. .

Laird of Grinnell has a chance to do
well in the javelin throw. He was
credited with a 139 foot heave in the
Missouri valley met last year and
tossed the spear better than 131 feet
yesterday in the preliminaries.

Rlnelort looks like an ace in the
shot put. Although his best throw
Friday was a half an inch under 44
feet, he has tossed the lead better than
49 feet in practice.

"Dad" Butler, Oregon Aggie coach,

III First Senior l‘llillu‘l.

President J. H. T. Main was the
speaker of the ﬁrst senior chapel held
yesterday The senior class was led
by George Wilson and Florence Hens
derson, junior class presidents, and
Loren Reid and Mary Tone, senior
class presidents.

President Main, in his address Cum-
pared the lectures of Bishop McCon-
nell and Sir George Paish, both of
which took place in Grinnell on the
same day. Commenting on the two
lectures be said. “It is signiﬁcant that
Sir George, the economist, and the
Bishop, star-ting out on entirely dif-
ferent roads, arrived at the same con-
clusion about the method of settling
the world's difficulties. They did not
use the word Christianity: they used
words for more compelling than any
creed or any form of doctirne, The:
wereconsidel‘lng the principles of life
revealed in the work of Jesus.”

President Main pointed out that the
United states export products to
China rank according to quantity in
the side : Bibles, rifles, rum, ”In
Europe," he said, we are chiefly in
evidence by our marines and our bate
tleships. Picture Johnny Walker in
C ‘na with a Bible under one arm and
a repeating rifle in the other."
in concluding he said, “England,
Japan, and the United States are the
three greatest powers in the world.
They hold in their hands harmony and
peace. It is up to them to see the
eternal realities behind the cold sur-
lace facts and do something."

Compiled by P. G. Norris, manager of
the Dibble baseball club, and official
scorelieeper of the Gl-inpell intra-
lnural league. His figures are for the
first round games of the round robin
series, and will be continued from
week to week until the end of the sear
son. They will be used for the ac-
curate compiling of a group of the
outstanding players to ‘form the
SCARLET AND BLACK all-team.)

It is to be noted that the court
house team is leading the league in
the matter of hitting. with an average
for the team of 333. This is accounted
for by the fact that the north-end
team met Building Four in their game,
and garnered a fairly large total of
hits. from which they scored fifteen
runs. to place them in the van in that
department also.

In team ﬁelding Dibble is relegated
to fourth place, Buildings rive, Three
and One placing above in that order.
Clark played errorless ball to defeat
Smith hall, and displayed a strong de-
lense for all hit balls. The Kelly
team also gave indications of pressing
all of the clubs for the honor of play-
ing the most faultless defensive game,
having had only one error chalked up
against them.

Pltcher's records cannot be taken
much into account as yet, Lamb, Dib-
ble, was the only winning hurler to go
the full route in last week‘s games,
and also charged himsolt with the
most strikeouts, turning eleven men
back in the Furenslc club game.

Building Three is showing the wily
in base stealing with a grand total of
seven piliered sacks in one game.
They also lead in the matter of sacri-
fice hits with two.

Perry Would Move
Statue of Liberty

Thinks It Should Be Placed In
Center of United States
For Patriotism.

“We should move the statue of Lil)-
erty lrom Ellis island, \lllel‘e it is a
source of owe to ioretgners, to the
center ol' the United States where it
could animate the patriotism of Am-
ericans," said lialpb B. Perry. Har—

Piol'cssor
y said that inter-nationalism cons
, in universalising the application
of those human relations which have
already- been adopted to n more lim-
ited extent, The traditional philosoe
pity of America commits her to search
tor an all comprehensive spirit or law
and order.

After tracing the coundation of Am-
ericiin democracy he declared the
league of Nations owes its existence
today, to the same principles that
justify the American state, straighb
forward hatred of war and and un-
sophisticated love of peace.

“The danger of America is not phys-
ical but moral. The world being what
it is, those men who pay debts are
better off than those who c'ollect them.
The man who is working is healthier
than the man who is living in luxury.

"The self made man is more admir-
able Wlllle be is making himselt than
when he thinks he is made. our great
danger is, that as a nation we will
mistake the plateau for the summit. We
will celebrate what we think is victory
while other warriors march by to
greater conquest ‘ "

Professor Perr s plea was for a Come
mon sense philoso hv of cooperation
between nations. he realization of
some order to embrace all mankind
must be the next rung on the ladder of
human progress on which man has
climbed from infant morality - — - So
long as civilization hangs on the issue
of an angry word what has been done
is too piuiully small to congratulate."

National sell respect was urged
however. He said "A nation may
accede itself right; live after its own
genius and still grant others the same
privilege. It is possible though not
easy to be a patriot without offending
others patriotism."
