The publications plan is out The board of
trustees at its meeting before Christmas
voted down the proposal as approved by an
overwhelming vote of the student body?
454 to 73 to be exact.

We realize that this was just one of the
many items of business that the board of
trustees took up at its meeting and also
that this gave it v ry little time for due
consideration of this plan.

Tile failure of this proposal to meet with
administrative approval raises this ques-
t} n in the minds of many: Can Grinnell
afford to adopt a complacent attitude and
sit back and depend on past achievements
to carry on its name? ’

A SINCERE EFFORT BY STUDENTS.

We are not trying to say that this pub-
lications plan was the curcsall of all the
publications problems on the campus. It un-
doubtedly had its short-comings as its spono
sors realizedgbut it was a sincere effort
on the part of the students to remedy a
bad situation. Because of the support the
plan aroused from various sections from
those who should know, there is every rea-
son to believe that it was worthy of a try
and that it should have been adopted. At
this time the Scarlet and Black wishes to
express its thanks and deep appreci tioil to
those ill authority who did lend their sup
port to the publications plan.

And so we repeat: can Grinnell afford
to he complacent? Are we moving forward?
If we are just standing still, we are slips
ping And there are indications which might
point to the fact that Grinnell is not only
standing still but actually slipping.

What’s wr llg with Grinnell? Who has
not heard this question ill the past two or
three years! It must be realized of course
that there is the youthful tendency to crit-

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ic e and that Grinnell students are not free
from this tendency. But our question goes
deeper than this.

In the first place these expressions by the
students themselves have grown in the past
few fears beyond the expected youthful
criticism of college students. Not only that:
this question and accompaning criticism has
gone beyond the pale of the college campus
and out illto the world where it really mate
ters.

WE WATCH GRINNELL GROW.

No where in all this criticism, however,
and th' " distinctly understood, is there
any cl'it .sri of lersonalities. Wherever
any one ll 5 criti C(l, it has been criticism
of poll , and policy only. In the following
discussmn it s not oili‘plcasurc t0 wanton
ly ci ti We or blame the adlllinistration. But
t! ore is l nclly a senior who leaves Grill»
llell that not moved by some feeling of
loyalty \"brch he has acquired by four years
rcs.dence here. We all like Grinnell, we
wont to be proud of our college, we all
want to see it get ahead, From the time, as
freshmen, whcn we looked on our tradi-
tions and ideals with a novel sort of wonder
down to the time when, as seniors, we had
acquired a real knowledge of the meaning
of these ideals and traditions and all they
were supposed to stand for, our interest in
G: incl] has been growing.

This interest has not been limited solely
to ideals and ti'editiolls either There is also
a. very practical side to this liking for Grins
nell. for there is hardly a senior or other
student who in this feeling of loyalty is not
faced with the question iii his own mind,
“Just what is the future of Grinnell?”
Many have been the pessimistic answers in
the past few years, and yet pessimism can
not solve the problem, for if we would have
progress we must face the issues squarely
and study the problem from the ground up.

We of the Sam-[ct and Block realize that,
in our editorial policies we have made mis-
takes, but never have we lost sight of our
aim which is always for a better Grinnell
As an organ of campus opinion and as a
free press we feel that it is our bounded
right and duty to criticize when we feel
that we ought to criticize and point the way
when we feel that we have a way to point.
GRINNELL IS DRIFTING!

Grinnell 1's drifting] It is almost impossie
ble to point to any one admillstrativc action
and soy, “Here is the crux of the matter,
here is where the trouble lies.” We can not
be so presumptious as to question the wis—
dam of each and every administrative ac
tion. We do not know all the small work-
ings of administrative management, and
there may be very definite reasons for ce-
tain actions taken by the administration in
past years, but we can criticize and point
to the ultimate effect of these actions.

There is no getting around the facts,
Grinnell college is not the college it used to
be! Where is the famous Men‘s Glee club,
the best in the west? The Harvard Ex-
change was dropped, but where is a pros
gi'cssivo substitute? Why has much needed
reorganization of several different depart-
ments not taken place? There are many
thing's to which Grinnell can point with
pride: the strenuous efforts of previous and
the present administrations to raise money
for endowments and running expenses; the
prowess of past Grinnell athletic teams
throughout the mid~west; and best of all
the enviable reputation of Grinnell as an
institution of high educational standards
and policies.

We must admit that the past six years
have been some of the hardest years the
college has ever been through. Different
conditions and different circumstances
brought on by the depression have made
the job of the administration one of the
most difficult; but there are many/things
that can be done without money, and they
have not been done. ,

We [ll almost let a crossroads. Tllc eon!

Stop Town
Open Houses

indent Council
Fails to Approve
Continuing Affairs

The town nien's organization yes-
tci‘day was refused the right to
hold open house dances on Fli<
day evenings by a decision oftns
White House committee.

The committee decided to end
the F‘i iday night open house dances
after the town men were given a
three-weeks trial by the Student
council last Nov. 15.

The decision climaxed a two
months dispute between the
White House committee and the
town men's organization over the
use of the recreation center on
Friday evenings.

According to Nancy McMur—
ray, chairman of the White
House committee, the three weeku’
trial of the men’s open house, al-
though the attendance at the
dances was good, was not in no»
cor-dance with the original pur»
pose that there he a stag line
and that students could come
singly and dance, play cards, ping
pong, and engage in any other
form of recreation offered by the
facilities of the recreation center.

Professor Finds

Driving Forces
ln Student Life

ITHACA, NY (ACP) Five
driving forces in the daily life of
the average college student have
been charted by Cornell univer-
sity's Dr. Jillian L. Woodward aft-
er an extensive research into
campus social life.

These d ing forces are: “the
drive for prestige; the need to
release tremendous energy by do
ing things and going places; the
wish to achieve independence
from home tics and be recognized
as an adult; the problem of rela—
Lionship with the other sex and
finally the planning for adult
life."

Dr. Woodward also determined
how students rate the prestige of
other students, He found that a
male student rates prestige by
”which fraternity he belongs to:
his campus offices and the teams
he makes; his smoothness, a com-
pound of clothes, car and ‘line';
and farther down the list his
grades, more as an index of in-
tclligence than of culture.“

Women students rate each oth-
er “f st by sorority. then by date
rating, a compound of the ability
to be invited out frequently and
the prestige of the men who date
them, then by college activities
and finally by grades as a mark
of intelligence."
