LOCK-STEP?

Editor’s Note: This is the first in a series of editorials
dealing with the system of absence regulations as revised by
the faculty this fall.

It has been officially announced that all freshmen and
sophomores will be allowed only nine cuts per semester with
out loss of credit hours, Apparently the faculty and admin-
istration feel that students are impai ng their scholastic
standing by excessive cutting of classes.

Is the proper approach to the solution of this problem
such stringent regulation of absences‘.7 Is it possible to mile
a student into successful classroom achievement? The de-
termining factor in the classroom is the student’s responsi-
bility—not the regulations restricting his use of that re-
sponsibility. The faculty has in the past recognized this by
allowing high standing upperclassmen to have unlimited
cuts. Is it not thell a reversal of policy to limit underclass

freedom so strictly?

What reasons can the facility have for believing that
the nine~cut limit will improve conditions? Cutting persists,
regardless of limitations, and far too many students lose
hours of credit who successfully pass classroom require
ments, The new rule cannot but impose a further tax of
hours lost on the students, for with a lowered limit, far
more will exceed it. Not only is every student exposed to
the danger of falling in a course, and so losing credit for
his time expended, but he is also liable to loss of hours for
absences, regardless of his classroom grade.

_ _We cannot condemn too strongly this emphasis upon
rigid classroom regularity, regardless of achievement. The
next logical rule is to require all students to file from class-
es ill lock-step, Without Whispering.

The important thing to the student and (we sllould
think) to the faculty is that students make satisfactory
achievements in learning. This achievement is contingent
upon the ability of the professor to interest his class, to put
across his points, and to assist students who have unusual
difficulty, The most frequent cause of cutting is unsatisfac-
tory achievement in the classroom. Surely the answer to
the problem the faculty seeks to solve, lies in a more close
check on the classroom achievements of students, whereby
th dcans' offices could bring immediate pressure to bear,
rather than mechanically storing up black marks in the of-
fice file which eventually bear fruit in adding further grief
to the student whell grades come out,

The cut system as now ill force, we feel, serves only to
plunge the delinquent student farther illto delinquency,
rather than to remedy the causes of his failur

It has ulwnys been our policy
to present, from to time, a choice
anecdote or two in re: the en-
dcaring naivote of the college pro-
ressor, genus Grmuclli. And it
has always been the policy of
the editors to strike out these
carefully-garnered anecdotes, with
the result that the good folk of
the school take the occasional
decimated appearance of the
column to bc a sign of general
disintegration and decay . . . .
