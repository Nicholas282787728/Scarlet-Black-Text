Government’s Success
(Or Lack Thereof)

This week, I decided to focus
not on the proper role of govern—
ment, but the siiccessoithe govettr
inent in its various roles. Given the
compositionoicongress iii the mod—
ern era, the number of roles pursued
by the government today are too
numerous to adequately evaluate in
my 900 word quota, sol hope you will
forgive rriy overlooking a few.

Let’s start with governing itself.
By this I mean the actual emciency
in bringing about and Executing
whatever policy the legislature crer
ates. Anyone who has had aprohlem
with asocialsecurity payment, a last
piece ofmail (the volume Ofmail lost
each year is astoundingly high. the
possible repercussions of that lost mail
are even more gargantuan), or had
the joy of filling out forty forms to
hold even a temporary government
job knows that the bureaucracy that
hasaccruedovertheyearshashelped
the efficiency ofthe system in much
the same way as barnacles and a cruis—
ers sailing. interesting note: this
year the I.R.S sent out letters asking
people if they wanted the same form
as last year or needed a different
form. At first, this may seem a Viable
solution to the problem of the gov«
etnmcnt’s sending out incorrect
forms, but the light of logic shows
otherwise. In reality it is simply a
mechanism for employing a new lay»
at of people to slow the already
clogged gears of government. I was
in the company of someone who re—
ceived one of these forms, and he
inked that next they will be sending
letters asking ifthe Victim would like
to have this new form sent to him.
Sounds ridiculous. but that only
makes it more likely in these times.

And next let's consider the effi»
cacy of our government in executing
the laws it passes. To see this type of
efficrency. one need only look at the
recent case ofa judge's telling police
officers that the kilo ofcocaine they
found in a duffel bag was inadmissi.
ble because the scattering ofa group
of guys at the approach of a police
car, Ieavmg the duffel bag behind,
was not probable cause.

Let’s move on to some of the
other roles our government has ap—
pended to its rob description. we
have the ”make sure everyone istreat—
ed equally“ bit, which manifests it—
selfinbasicallytellingemployersthat
they have to officially favor minori—
ties to make up for the prejudice they
have (whether this prejudice exists
or not). This role can also come in

the guise ofscholaiships offered spe—
lelcally {or one minority or another.
etc. In the end, this role has had two
major effects. it has cieated or magr
nified a (lisgtumlcmcm among the
majority harmed by this institution-
alized discrimination. This seethingY
undercurrent oranget caused by the
government’sdiscriminationagainst
the inaiority has engendered racism,
thus allowing government to create
discriminaiion while trying to fight
it. This makes sense, considering
that the government is officially ac—
knowledging a difference in race in
older to abolish n The other effect
of this has been the creation in the
public eye of an all—purpose scape—
goat. If someone doesn't like his
situation, he doesn't have to blame
himself; he can ,ust blame it on the
whitemale. lisorricthinggocswrong,
one can always find encouragement
to rationalize the conveyance otciil.
pability to the ivhite triale If you
don't like what is being taught in
your philosophy course, don't go
through the trouble oftrying to log.
ically and objectively evaluate the
argument, lust blame it an the white
male (Yah, Socrates, you were \\ tong
because you were a white male; now
just shut up and drink the hemlock).
If you know of someone who has
been laid off, dont ponderthe possi.
bility that he ivill probably rind a
better iob (with a modest pay in.
crease), lust blame the white male
who owned the business that put the
business for whom your aquaintence
worked out of business The popu—
lace as a whole has encouraged this
because it likes not haying to take
responsibility for its own action.

As tar as favorably inﬂuencing
the economy, one simply has to read
either ofthe last two weeks' articles
to see that the economy does best
when the government stops trying to
tinker With it.

Lastly, let‘s not forget the ”HIV
tary. Hell, it is pretty much the only
arena in which the government has
been Successful. Now. I know that
there are enough conspiracy stories
about the department of defense to
make Oliver Stone blush, but when
one simply looks at the end product
of our military. it is hard not to be
impressed. Let's ,ust take sometime
and consider all the times in recent
history (say the last century or so)
that the United States has been suc—
cessfully invaded. Let’s just think of
all the times we have had our union
states overrun by foreign power, I
know it isn’t as interesting as pre»
millenialism and its effect on mod—
ern day Europe, but that is the entire
point ls it coincidence that our
governmenthasbeenabletosucceed
at doing this role while railing tniser.
ably at others? I think not. (And
therefore, Descartes vanished in a
puff of logic)

GEAR’S AIDS Beneﬁt
To the Editor:

On April 13, an AIDS Benefit
was held in the Harris Center. It was
sponsored by GEAR (Orinnelliaiis
Escalating AIDS Response), and had
the involvement ofseveral business»
es from town and student groups. it
ii as truly a Towiiooivn e\ ont, Ap»
ptoxnnately $1,500 was raised for
the AIDS Project of Central Iowa.
Imagine how much could have been
raised if professors or administrators
had attended.

It is upsetting to me that Grim

of the best ways for us to improve

TV Use On Campus

To the campus community:

Aftct spending inany Thursday
nights desperately trying to find a
television On campus which was not
playing NBC's beloved line-up,
which includes Friends and ER. he
have come up with a proposal which
ue feel is bolh fair and simple to
implement. Due in the popularity of
these shows, we understand that peo-
ple naturally want to view them. but
is it really necessary tbliave eteryset
on campus tuned into one staiion7
We believe that fans of these shows
should gather in several designated
viewing spots. The lounge in Harris,
the North Lounge ofihe Forum, and
a few large lounges in dorms such as
Loose and Norris couldallbe used for
this purpose, Not only would this
free up televisions for those of us
whose favorite shows also happen to
be from 7—10 onThursday nights, but
it would also allow followers ofthese
