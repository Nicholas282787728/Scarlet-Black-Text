WITH THE JOB SURVEY

Editorial praise in college newspapers is
often considered to be a diplomatic duty,
and the editorial columns a cheap public
relations departmentimerely a potential
big stick which, through lack of use, car-
ries no other weight than a plentiful bale
last of soft soap.

It is not rare that persons or insti-
tutions have been lulled into false happi—
ness and satisfaction through masterful
jobs of back-patting with willowy editorial
compliments. The net result is the lilti—
mate failure of the newspaper to see things
objectively, to tell the truth llnflinchingly,
or to criticize impartially. And tlle ob-
ject of the false enthusiasm receives an
expanded ego and corresponding loss of
awareness to its own shortcomings.

It was, therefore, with criticism afore»
thought that we sampled the work of the
Chicago job survey during spring vaca—
tion; but try as we might, nowhere could
we find the shove to push the editorial
chip from our shoulder.

We went to Chicago with the under-
standing that we would have the oppor—
tunity to interview'leaders in the field in
which we were interested. We expected to
be told what business and industry had
to offer the college graduate. We expected
to make contacts, to get job hunting leads
and ideas. We hoped to obtain the exper»
iencc that would put us at ease and give us
the knowledge of how to conduct ourselves
when the real job hunt comes after gradua-
tion. And in the great majority'ol’ cases
we found just that.

We wanted to know the truth about
our chances to obtain a job in the vocation
of our choice. We wished, moreover, to
know the facts concerning the value of our
liberal education. All this we had every
opportunity to obtain—if we didn’t, the
fault was our own.

The inner sanctums of such welleknown
companies as American Telephone and Tele-
graph, Armour, Carnegie Illinois Steel,
Christian Science Monitor, Columbia Broad-

casting System, Commonwealth Edison, Dun
and Bradstreet, Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago, General Mills, Marshall Field,
MolltgomeryWard,Proctorand Gamble, Rem-
ington Rand, Sears Roebuck, Swift, Travel-
ers Insurance and Western Electric were
opened for us. Often we met bigwigs we
never could have seen by using the best
of our own gate-crashing abilities or “pull."

In five years the Grinnell job survey
has grown enormously in scope and bene
fits. It now offers the cities of Des Moines
and Minneapolis as well as Chicago for
fields of vocational research.

The survey has not been satisfied to
rest upon its laurels; rather, it has sought
advice and criticism, encouraging new ideas
and incorporating those deemed to be of
value, Through the eleven radio programs
aired from Chicago stations and through
the columns of print and pictures given to
the survey by the Chicago newspapers
Gl-innell college received a wealth of pub-
licity that would have cost thousands of
dollars to purchase.

In retrospect, we cannot help but believe
that if a few more ideas such as the job
survey, managed with the same foresight
and with the same progressive spirit, could
be introduced at Grinnell college we could
label the editorial stick, “For Back-Potting
Only."

BERTRAND RimE—#

The recent court decision banning Bertrand
Russell from n professorship of philosophy
ill the College of the City oi" New York can
be described only as unfortunate to all
concerned,

It is unfortunate first for those ”good"
people, Bishop Manning, Mrs. Jean Kay,
Judge John E. McGeehan, and all the other
promoters of the anti-Russell movement.
For they have glamorized those very “im—
moral and salacious doctrines” of Russell
from which they would protect American
youth through the furor which they have
raised and through the petty, sensational
publicity given them by the press. And
although they were successful in ' venting
Russell from assuming his posi on, they
have defeated their own purpose by making
him appear as something of a national hero
in {the eyes of the college youth, and by
investing Russell’s more radical beliefs with
the irresistible charm of forbiddallce, K

It is unfortunate also for Russell, one
of the greatest philosophers and mathe—
maticians of our times, and who came to
this country because of its liberal thought,’
that he should be prevented from accepting
an academic position ill which there can be
little relation with his private views on
morality. The action of the New York
court belies America’s reputation for free
dom of speech and liberal academic thought,
and provides ample justification for Rus-
sell’s comparison between himself and Soca
rates, who was executed for debasing the
morals of the Greek youth.

But most of all, it is unfortunate, not
only to the students of the College of the
City of New York, who will not receive the
benefits of his instruction, but to students.
everywhere. We cannot appreciate the at!
tempt of a few “righteous" individuals tol
force us into the sheltered security of a
cloister and coddle us into a state of intel-
lectual stupor.

We can only agree with the American
Committee for Democracy and Intellectual
Freedom that American youth must develop
its own judgments through a knowledge
of conflicting views if we are to preserve
the academic freedom of a vigorous democr
racy.
