Quadrangle Gossip

/

Should you ask me whence these ru—
mors,

theIlee these choice J, B.'s and gos-
sips .

0f the notion oi the League Board,

or sly entrances through windows,
or the plan to raid the K. P.,

of the faculty's cruel mandates,

OI new cases and engagements,

I should answer ‘

I should tell you.

From the Dorms and irom the Quad-
tangle,

From the Dean of.Wonlen’s office,
From the stocks or the library,
From things Seen in the south parlors
Where they “snuggle up together,"
And iorget to draw the curtain.

I repeat them as I heard them,

From the lips oi one who saw them,
or whose friend's friend's friend had
told her,

There was once it vacation

In which

One was not supposed

To go homer

So everybody went there,

But there was iirst a dance.

And some toiks didn't know

That there were

Week night regulations

About parlor: and loggia.

And. others didn’t know

That one should not smy out

To see one’s friends'

on

On all the night trains

If one were not going on one

One's self.

And still others were denied the knoW<
ledge

That punch was being served

In the reception hell;

But among the letter

Were 'vel'y few. ‘

And shortly after—

A matter of a few days—

Those who had gone come,

And one rushed up to one’s iriends-

‘ Ami cried out,

"on, when did you get ha‘ckl"

And embraced, sometimes

And thus endeth

The vacation.

When you've cutyouriast music les—
son heroic vacation—

Forgotten it was the last,

And the penalty—

And you return with sinking heart

And suffering pockethoolr

To pay the price of your fol'getfulness‘

And you ﬁnd that your instructor
wasn’t there either,

Oh, boy, ain't it a grand and glorious
feelin”!

Among the Neighbors

The soldier balms students at the
engineering college of the University
of Wisconsin are doing much better
work than the regular stildcnts, says
the Daily Cardinal.
E. A. Fitzpatrick, secretary at the
State Board of Education, in making
public this report said: "From reports
received from other schools and col-
leges, the soldier bonus students have
done remarkably well and have Settled
down to the day to day Work with
greater earnestness and very evidently
"with more than avert e success ”

Utilizing Nature’s Power

LECTRICAL energy generated by water
power has grown to be one of our greatest
natural resources— and we have only begun to
reach its possibiilAles. It mines and reﬁnes our
ores, turns the wheels of industry, drives our
street cars and lights our cities and towns. The
power obtained from N attire saves many million
tons of coal every year.

At ﬁrst the field of its utilization was limited by the dis-
tance electricity could be transported. But soon research
and engineering skill pointed the way to larger and better
electrical apparatus necessary for high-voltage trans-
mission. Then ingenious devices were invented lo insure
protection against lightning, short-Circuits, etc, which
cause damage and interrupt the service. And now all over
the country a network of wires begins to appear, carry-
ing the magic power:

The General Electric Company, with its many years’ ex-
perience, has played a great part in hydroelectric develop.
merit. By successfully coordinating the inventive genius
of the Company and its engineering and manuiaciuring
abilities, it has accomplished some of the greatest achieve-
merits in the production and application of electrical
energy. '

The old mill Wheel of yesterday has gone. Today the
forces of immense volumes of water are harnessed and
sent miles away to supply the needs of industry and
business and the comforts of the home.
