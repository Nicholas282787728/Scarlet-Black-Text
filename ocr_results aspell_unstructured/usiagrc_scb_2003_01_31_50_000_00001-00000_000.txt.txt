A campus
community
in crisis

"Today we mourn for the
Grinnell College student who
was the victim of one of the
most unspeakable acts or
brutality against a human
being; we mourn for the

‘ countless other victims of
rape and sexual assault who
.must live with scars that
even time cannot heal; and
we abo mourn iorthe ramily
members, loved ones and
friends or rape victims who
must live with the piercing
reality that they were not
able to prevent a rape bum
ncruiring against someone
whom they love and care for.

”What is important is not
the identity or the person
who was the victim of rape
on this campus. what is
important, however. is what
ire as students, faculty and
administrators are going to
do to address this issue and
ensure that Gnnnell college
becomes a place where men .
and women have adequate
resources and support to
protect themselves against
individuals who pose a threat
to their safety and survival.

“its a first step, we must
acknowledge the overwhelm-
ing fear and anxiety that
women must live with from
day-to-day in a milieu where
few men respect their human
dignity and selfslvorth. no
woman should have to live
each day with the threat of
being attacked at any
moment by an aggressor. No
women should be asked to
live in an environment that
expects them to depend on
men fur protection and/or
inadequate resources to
ensure their safety and
survival.

”No matter how much this
community wants to accept
this, the recent inrldent
reveaLs students vulnerability
to crime and violence on this
campus. Unfortunately,
Grinnell is not the utopia or
safe or insular environment
which it promises to be to
most of its students; it is a
pseudo utopia whose
existenre is as much
threatened by violence and
crime as is the larger society.
However, when this
institution sees itself in
isolation to the outside
world, it n'sks the danger of
perpetuating a continuous
cycle or internal conflict."
