UST now, as Iowa is mak is

ations of high schools and estab
lishing more hal‘moniousand intir
mate relations between the higher
and lower institutions of learning,
the are informed by the Nan/sir!-
Iir of the Western Reserve Uni-
versity that Ohio is bringing about
the some conditions through simir
lar measures. Thetwoik was be
gun in a moderate way last year,
and the results promise so satis-
factorily that it is to be continued
annually as a deﬁnite feature of
educational work. The necessity
oi such a step appears as evident
in Ohio as in Iowa. The deﬁcienr
ties in the training of students der
manding admission to Freshman
classes can be plonded tor in the
college curriculum, antl a spirit of
mutual sympathy and assistance
is established by the closer at}
quaintanceship between the Cole

lege and high school tacnlties.

ﬁt not to accept the call to Iowa
College. He is not to be blarnetl
because ot his prctcrence to. this
newpositron. Iowa College knows
she can not offer material illtlucer

with those of Yale. ln sending

plainly given, that is, it the very
plausible surmise mentioned is
correct.

vicissitudes of Scientific Asso-
ciatiol'Iu

About six years ago a society
was formed among a tew or the
students and members of the face
ulty tor the purpose of promoting
the scientiﬁc inlelests of the
school. This society was called
the Goodtlow Scientiﬁc Associa-
tion.

Professors of science and stur
dents who had taken a minor in
any scientiﬁc line were eligible
for membclship; its lectures. hows
ever, were free to all and were cle-
liveiecl twice a month by mem»
bers. among whom the subjects
were discussed informally at the
close of the lecture.

Thesociety was not really; pars
mancnt one; there were no fees.
regulations or bylaws, and each
year it was practically reorgane
ized. This year, however, there
has been no effort toward contitr
uing the Association. The fact
that there are fewer scientiﬁc stu-
dents this year, and that the lCC
ttlres involve consltlel'able work
upon its members may enter into
the Causes of its tlisbandlng.

It is a matter oi regret that the
only scientiﬁc society we have
shoultl be allowed to lapse.
