SHALL THE LECTURE COURSE BE

The ttnic has crime in the his-
tory of the Y. .\I. C. A, Lecture
Course when the members of
the Association are confronted
with two questions which must be
ans-tiered very dcci ‘vely it ihrs

is to be carried on next year. The
ﬁrst question is \\hctlicr the stur
dents and people oiGrinriell want
at lecture Course and the second
pertains-to the character of the
entertainments to be provided.
It is the ﬁrm belret‘ or the com-
mittee that the series of enter-
tainments and lectures given in
this way are appreciated by many
and would be greatly missed
were they to be discontinued. but
they are of the opinion that these
numbers should be surﬁciently at
tractive themselves to make
them selfrstipportiiig without un-
due adver ' 'ng or urging tor
support out of loyalty to an un-
dertaking of the Association. It
should be born in mind that the
lecture course is notaphilantltropr

ceases to pay tor rtseli it will be

ARTtSTS' RECITAL SERtEs

First Recital Friday, Febtuary so, by
Herbert Butler.

The ﬁrst recital in the School ol
Music series will be grveu by Her-
hert Butler. violinist, in the Col-
lege Chapel Friday evening at 3
o’clock. Mr. Butler will piesent a
very ﬁne program, given below.
and will have tor his accompanist
Mr. Dudley L, Smith. Mr. Butr
ler’s program is or a character
eminently suited to an audience
whose taste tor music is well de-
veloped, but whose acquaintance
with Violin literature is not ex»
tensive. Mr. Butler has chosen
tor presentation several oi the
standard compositions for the
violin, which every one should
know; as for example the Men
delssohn concerto, the Bach char
conne. and the less class nurn
bers by Sat'asatc and \Nieniawslcl.
His program is thoroughly sea-
soned with a number of modern
compositions whose popularity is
quite decided, and with these. and
the brilliant numbers mentioned
above, Mt. Butler's recital may
be expected to inaugurate the
series most auspicimisly.

The other recitals of the course
will maintain the standard set by
the First, and no one need feel the
slightest hesitation as to the valtie
or the people who ale to appear.

Both Miss Willard and MISS I-Iam»

bers til the School ol Music facttlr
ty, and their presence on the
course is due to the fact that their
ability is unquestioned and their
interest in this work keen The
