QED ituxiut

a WORD at this lullctltrc in
L _ regard It) the ﬁnancial side
of our athletic affairs will not be
out of place. It IS a well known
tact that the spring season

athletics has never been a solllce
oi proﬁt, and also that in some
years the balance has hcen der
clsively on the llron: side at the
ledger This year however has
turned out to be the least proﬁt-
able, the most disastrous of any
we have ever undergone. A debt
that stood at two hundred dollars
hetore the scason opened new has
increased totem hundred and the
end is not yet. Just how much of
this unfortunate condition is due

to bad weatheranrl bad lllckiand _

how much to lack of interest on
the part at the students. 15 a ques-
tion. But there can be no doubt
that the latter element
largely into the proposition.
However that may be the [act
confronts us that there soon must
be a change somewhere, it not in
the attitude oi the college people
toward athletics, then in the policy

or athletic management.
