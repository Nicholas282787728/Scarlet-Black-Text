College to add
sub-free dorm

by DAVID Looms

Imagine a Grinnell where residents in
Cleveland Hall are forbidden to smoke or
diink and the dorm is kept clean and free of
nrucous parties. In the next few weeks, this
irnaginary rale could be come a reality,

In an effort to respond to increasing stri-
dcnt requests for substance-fret: housing, sm-
dent Affairs is considering designating anoth-
er dorm on carnprrs as entirely sub-free, with
choices narrowed down to Norris, Cleveland
and Main.

According to Loosehead RLC and Assist
taiit Director of Residence Life Kim HindSe
Brush, nrany incoming students are requesting
subefrec housing arrangements each year, and
yet are denied. in 2007, 123 incoming students
for the class 0(2011 rcquestcd subiree hous-
ing as their first choice, but the College only
had roorrr to satistv 45 orthe requests. Ot‘this

quests were filled.

sions now are simply dec ing which one.

In the past Stildc‘ntt slras accommo-
dated extin sub- tree icquc ring sub~
flee doors or clusters spc frcall'r for fit
in otlieiivisc non silb f e doims. “But the
problems that arise there are you re having all
iirsteyear floors which obvious 4 is not a good
idea because you want them to interminglc
with uppcreclass students," said John Burrows
'10, SGA vice piesideiit ofSnldenr Affairs and
Residence Life Committee member. It’s also
a problem because we’ve heard mixed reviews
about subtfree clusters in meeting the needs of
subtfree students"

Administrators identiﬁed Main, Clever
land and Norris as potential subefree dorms
speciﬁcally because of their number of rooms
and overall capacity to house frrsreyears, the

student group most
likely to request sub-
fiee housing. Other
iesidence halls were
eliminated because
of a small number of
'oonis. a poor mix of
ingles and doubles,
or the presence of
gender neutral ﬂoors
or CD-cpst
Which dorm is
chosen could also imr
pact the subtfree status of other residence halls.
If Norris becomes subefree, then Smith. which
is currently a subefi'ec dorm, would no longer
be sub-free. If either Main or Cleveland are
chosen, then smith would remain sub-free.

Some students were iesistant to the pro—
posed change because of its potential impact
on the campus environinent.“l tliiiik any dorm
would be hesitant to go subafrce, since there's
been such a long tradition not being so," said
Adam Langc '11, SA for James lstt “Unless a
completely new dorm is built and made to be
sub-free from the start, there will be a great
deal oftesistancc.”

Langc also believed that both Main and
Cleveland were not ideal choices because
“South Campus is stereotyp cally not srrhefree,

it would be hard to force the change,” he

No problems in Grinnell on Election Day

“YJAMES MALEWITZ BLJEt-‘r RADEKSTRONG

Despite the popularity of early voting this
year, Grinnell's Community Center and Vetere
ans Memorial building were heavily trafﬁcked
on Tuesday as local residents cast votes for ere
ctything from president to sheriff. And despite
fears ofdifrrcultics at the polls, the voting pro»
cess commenced largely without incident.

The hotly contested State Representative
race between incumbent Eric Palmer (D) and
former representarive Danny Carroll (R) feae
tuted some of the highest campaign spends
ing of any state race this year. Palmer defeated
Carroll by about 1200 votes. with unofficial
election tallies showing Grinnell’s first watdi
which includes the Collegcicasting 1300 of
the 4295 votes for Palmer.

Many students voted early to avoid prob-
lems with voting tinting a potentially hectic
election day. But the day befoie the test of
Giinlicll votcd, dozens of students who voted
early found their eligibility in limbo.

This past Monday, a day before thc ofticial
Election Day ofNoin 4, 50 studciits'vntcs were
challenged by Powcsltiek county Republican
Party co-clrarrs Richard Jacoby and Harry
Meeks. While the votes, which were all cast
dining early vorrng on oct.13,wcre eventually
counted, the challenge led to a frantic push on
eilllipus to reregisrer students.

The votes were challenged on the techni-

with 5,441 compared‘to McCain’s 4,331.

Nationally. this year‘s else on had high
voter turnout rates ofover 126 million, accord
ing to a study from American University. But
despite hundreds ofpostcrs, stickers and signs
trumpeting the run up to the election, corn-
pared to the past presidential election, Pow-
eshielt County actually had fewer voters go
to the polls. According to the Iowa Secretaiy
of the state website, 10,260 people voted in
Poweshiek in 2004. Official vote counts have
not been released yet, but i tally of unofficial
results from the county auditor shows 9,945
people cast a vote for president in the county
on Tuesday.

According to Tommy Haas, chairperson of
Powesliiek county’s third ward, presidential
elections usually have the highest voter turn
out, which translates to a problematic day for

election workers. “There’s a lot ofpeople who
only vote every four years," Haas said while
passing ortt forms to other county workers “so
therefore, their addresses aren't changed [on
their registration], or they’ve gotten married,
or whatever. So today I‘ve got a lot of extra
work.”

some College students and poll workers
also expected challenges at the polls The day
before, when sealed early votes were officially
opened, a pair ofloeal Republican lawyers chal-
lenged the registration forms of so students
who had already participated in early voting
(see article, page 1). “1 was personally worried
about challenges," Donna German, chairpere
son of Poweshiek County’s Ninth Precinct
said. “But I resent [challenges] because we do
our work ethciently"

To avoid challenges, students had been eii-
