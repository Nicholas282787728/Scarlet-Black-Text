_Do You INHALE?

 

Here goes
the last “sacred cow” in
cigarette advertising!

NHALING has long been on “uuv

touchuble". . . a subject taboo in
the tobacco trade . . . a "sacred cow”!
Why Because in every tobacco lenf
—even the ﬁnest, the mildest—mtufe
hides certain impurities which, when
nor removed, are unkind to delicate
membranes!

And since, knowingly or unknow-
ingly, we all inhale some part of the
smoke fromourcigafctte—LuckySilike
developed that great scientiﬁc process
which removes certain impurities.

Luckies created that process. Only
Luckies have it!

Do you inhale? Remember—mote
than 20,000 physicians, after Luckies
hddbeenfurnishedthemfortests,ba5ing
their opinions on theirsmaking exfnimre,
stated that Luckies are less irritating
to the throat than other cigarettes.

“It's toasted"

Your Throat Protection
against irritation—against cough
