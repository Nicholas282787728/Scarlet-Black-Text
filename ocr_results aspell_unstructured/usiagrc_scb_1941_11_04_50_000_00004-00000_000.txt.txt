Pioneers Will Travel
To Ripon Salurday
For Crucial Game

Saturday the Pioneer grid-
del‘s meet Ripon in the loig
game of the week in the Mld<
west conference.

At present the Redmen top the
standings, and if they win Satur-
day, they will have a clear claim
to the title. If Grinnell wins, the
Pioneers have to defeat Cue for
the undisputed championship.

Saturday Ripon downed Law-
rence 13 to 7. The only mark
against them in the conference is
their tie game with Monmouth.
Pioneers Set.

The Pioneer squad should be at
nearly top shape by Saturday. Alr
though Ed Nagel, Jerry Grant,
and Ray Mathews all suffered leg
injuries, none of them appear
to be hurt seriously enough to
be out of the game at Ripon.

Despite Grinnell’s big advent»
age in statistics, the Beloit game
was more bruising than any oth-
er so far this season.

Line Stars

Grinnell’s win last Saturday
was the fourth straight of the
year. Once again it was the P104
ncer line that put on the show
for most of three quarters. As
the Clock ticked away the min-
utes of the final quarter, the ef—
fense clicked with its usual Speed.

The Grinnell touchdown drive
began on the Beloit 44 yard line.
Augie Gruening lost a yard on
the first play, but Nagel passed
to McCartney on the 33 for first
down. A plunge by Nagcl netted
five more yards, and then he toss-
ed a long one to Harry Waters
in the end zone for the score. Na-
gel's kick was wide.

A few minutes later the scarlet
and black clad gridders roared
back. This time Don Hock in—
tercepted a Blue Devil pass on
the Beloit 30 and ran it back for
a touchdown. Jack Bredimus con-
verted from placement.
