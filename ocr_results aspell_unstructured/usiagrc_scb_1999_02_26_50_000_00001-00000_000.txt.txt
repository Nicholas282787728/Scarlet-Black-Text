meetings—one in Main lounge and one in
Haines loungcibut eventually they intend to‘
hold a study break rot each orthe seven RLC
clusters on campus,

ciady, who came up with the idea for the
study breaks, said his motivations were “to get
out in the halls and talk to [students]. The
goal is to ask students about every aspect or
student life and see how they feel about it."

Topics addressed at the First two sessions
spanned a range orissues, from noise levels in
residence halls to the capstone experience.
Lucinda Schutaman ’00, who attended the
ﬁrst study break in Maine lounge, said, “1
asked a lot oreruestions, mostly about why the
‘data’ suggest class size is small and not
changing. . .yet everyone is complaining about
getting kicked out orclasses and classes ate at
maximum capacity."

Donaldson answered the question with a

Venugopal said his method would be “to
communicate with students or the college."

Also, although Venugopal believed in form»

rake care that these committees functioned
properly.

other subiects or discussion, said
Schutzman, included ways to improve dorms,
ways to improve student lire, campus traditions,
and “what we really enjoyed about Grinncll.”

Though many orthesc topics indirectly tee
late to the college's current involvement in de-
signing a campus master plan, crady said that
the study breaks did not focus on this issue
because the project is still in its preliminary
stages. Bcfote earnest decision making begins,
Crady said he would like “to discuss [the mas-
ter plan] a lot and see how students
reel. . .[There are] issucsormulticultural space,
a campus center, a new residence hall, and cert.
traliaed dining. Everything's on me table, but
nothing has been decided yet.”

Osgood said. “1 might have sad a row things
about [the master plan]. . .some students asked
a rew questions about it. it's always good to
listen to students, Some decisions will un-
doubtedly be made. .but it's premature to say
[what] I’m considering."

Another equally central issue that the study
breaks did rocus on was selfcgovcmancc. “Stu-
dents reel pretty strongly that selr governance
is [important]," said ctady.

Although‘only four students attended the

session might orrer.

showed up at thesecond study break. Bradley
said he believed the comparatively minimal
attendance at the first study break might be
attributed to “lack oradvertising.“

Tom Kim '99, who had not seen publicity
for either session, said, “They should public
ciac it more. .twith posters. 1honestly didn't
know anything about Russell Osgood this se.

Although Osgood had also found the ﬁrst
meeting “sparsely attended," he said the sec—
ond was “very well attended,"

“I think itwent rinc," said Osgood, noting
that the rormat or the study breaks was con.
ducive to more intimate dialogue than a larger
“it was a smaller group
than [you would rind at an] all campus
meeting. ,.\We thought the students would be
a little more open to discussion,"

ctady said, "Open forums are fine, butyou
miss a lot or students who can’t attend that
one night. ..1 like this format so much, 1 guess
I'll probably continue in the ruturc.”

The next study break will take place on

Sexual Assaul’r Working Group s’rrives
to ’reach empowerment, confidence

BY MARISSA THOMPSON
StaFfWritur

The Sexual Assault Working Group
(SAWG) has planned a wcek.and.a.halr or
speakers and presentations under the banner
of“Futthcting our Awareness."

Meredith Norfolk '99, Nick Latina ’99,
Anna Tekippe ’99, Jo Schmlman '99, Norris
RLc Ahnalee brincks, and Director or Stuv
dent Activities Lisa Mlltyc, all members or
SAWG, are eager to attract new students ac-
tivists to the group since most orrhcm are leav.
ing arter this year

on Tuesday, speaker Bob Hall gave two
conﬂictmanagementpresentations, The-ﬁrst,
f‘Leatning to Livcwith Conﬂict," was directed
primarily towards student start, and dealtwith
conrlict in all oroiir relationships. The sec—
ond presentation, called “Hands om Lets
Talk," was more interactive and Focused on
conﬂict management specincrlly in the Con»
tettt orsetual assault and intimacy in relation»
ships.

Hall established his company. Learning to
Livewith Conﬂict, Inc, in 1987. Since then,
he has given presentations in over 500 colt

leges in 47 states and Canada. He majored in
business, he said, so that he could set up his
own company in case he didn’t come across
the right job offers. "Everything I wanted to
work with had to deal with conﬂict," he said.

Hall's interest in coniiict goes back a ways.
stemming from a black belt in Judo, Hall's in.
tercst in self-defense led him to review close to
one hundred books on self-defense and
victimology. He also studied the philosophies
orcandhr and Martin Luther King Jr. Ulti»
mately, he came to see conﬂict as an opportuc
nity rot self-empowerment and growth, and
through his company he's been sharing his ideas
with others rot the past twelve years,

In his presentation of‘lcarning to Live
with conﬂict," his interactive approach in»
cluded asking questions or the audience and
giving anecdotes along with providing his own
inrormation in lecture rormat.

He suggested that people getaway rrom
using just the head rot conﬂict resolution, and
instead approach conﬂict rrom adiirerent level.
Describing how knowledge, skills and cxpcri-
encc guide our lives, he said the biggest chil.
lenge is the human heart when were dealing
with conﬂict.

Society is conﬂict-negative, he said, and

allows conﬂicts to brew until they are as dev-
astating as wildﬁre, so large that they demand
our attention. Thus, when we have a bad ex-
peticncc in this situation, he described, it re»
inrorccs that all conrlicts are bad and negative.

“We perceive what’s conﬂict as a ﬁght, and
the perception drives the reality," be elaborated.
He recommended ashirt in our mode orthink.
ing, saying that problumrsulving. attacking the
problem rather than each other, is a step in
the righrdirection, but it doesn't go rarenough.

“conﬂict allows rot learning and growth,
no matter what happens," he articulatcdt
“There’s a lesson orrt-red by pain, 1rwe en.
dure the pain lire presents, we learn and grow,
and can create a new lire h’ cry." Hc cncour-
aged the attitude, “yeah, this is crisis, but 1 can
get through it."

l-lowcvct, “all conilicts are It”! resolvable,"
be emphasi d. First, he said, we all have dir.
rercnt deﬁnitions about conﬂict that can't be
agreed upon, and secondly, we are orten ready,
willing. and able to deal with iss
tionships at dirretent, not coinciding, times.

He supported acceptance orconrlict, be-
cause, “whether you want it or not, Conﬂict
will be in your lite on a daily basis.”

“There will he mistakes," be said, “and it's

,5 in relac

okay," He encouraged us to be gen l-vvitli
ourselves, and to avoid beating ourselves up
when we make a mistake.

He recommended that we approach the
situation wanting to learn something, with
out a rigid set orotpectations, and without
expecting ourselves to act a speciﬁc way, but
asking ourselves, “what can 1 learn hero?"
This, he said, will help us see connict as'nn
opportunity for growth and learning. which
will allow its to cxpctlcncu a richer and luller

However, Osgood denied these assertions,
“1 can’t say I've even seen the survey," said
Osgood. “[Thc email] presupposes I have
an ,.agenda,vvhich is false...Idon’t even know
the national trends."

Tom ctady. Dean orStudent Arrairs, said
that the survey was not connected to any plans
to change drug and alcohol policies. "There’s
no conspiracy out there,,.The federal govern-
ment requires lcollcges to survey alcohol and
drug iisel every raw years. .The last time [we
took a survey] was in 1996.”

Still, recent changes in other campus op-
erations had made some students wary ofav
tiotts that might impede upon selrgovernance.
Alissa Nashold ‘00 noted a numberorincidents
in recent years that she believed might have
rostered suspicion of policy makers, including
the switch to computerized key cards, the un»
anticipated resignation or rotmer president
1>nmela Ferguson, and the new campus secu-
rity rotee,
