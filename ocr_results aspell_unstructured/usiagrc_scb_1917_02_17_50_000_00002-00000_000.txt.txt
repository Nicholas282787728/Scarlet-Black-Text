With the question oi military trains
ing one of the livest topics ol the
present moment, it is interesti g to
note how varied and how illuminating
are the opinions of contemporary stu-
dcnt newspapers on the subject.

As might have been expected, the
eastern institutions have taken a
strong stand in favor of military
training and or the tullest extent or
preparedness. Even the Michigan
Daily, which has just come to our
desk and whose editorial comment is
always very caretully worked out, says
that “Llle future looks for college trains
ed men who know something about
war, to act as leaders in the prophesied
conﬂict." ’

In Iowa, the Drake Delphic, which
has had decided pacifist tendencies in
the past, comes out in iavor of sup
porting the government and possibly
to the extent or preparing the college
man for war, but opposes anything
compulsory in a kind of military train-
ing. The Delphic “pledges the college
men or the nation to the support of
the United states government" and
goes on to say that “although the col-
lege man is emphatically in favor of
every possible means to prevent war,
and recognizes war as a result of im—
perfect civilization. he is the least this
posed at all men to permit any denial
or his legitimate rights."

Over at Ames the Iowa state Stu-
dent has tigured out that AmeS can in
a very brief time supply 1,soil trained
men ior army service. At Princeton a
vote was taken of the student body and
the result was that i303 favored oni-

versal military training while 92 up"

posed it. At Pennsylvania it is stated
that 1,450 or the university men [avor
it.

Then there are a low extreme conv
scrvativcs who ar decidedly opposed
to any kind of mi tary training whale
socvcr. Papers like the U
Daily Kansnn have a tendency no wait
a while to think it over. The Oberlin
Review, too, while possibly in favor
of somc kind of military training, is
“firmly opposed to universal coluplllr
sol-y military training.”

In general it might seem lrool cdi-
torial comment tronl American col-
lege papers that while a few eastern
organs are stiongly in [over oi unlr
versal compulsory military training,
the western papci. oblcct to any sysr
tcm that is compulsory in its nature,

at the same time ilot opposing that

principle or training college men in
some way.

We acknowledge receipt of a com
tribution to tho McAlmon [und from
“Booker” strong, New York City.

“We ought to be ashamed of the low
mpics of conversation which we [tur-
suc iii our ovcryday life. What we
say, not only shows what we are, but
also makes us what we are.” This was
the statement made by Professor
James Hardy Ropes in chapel Friday
morning.

what about the little things or the

them, but he thinks more of what is
