each game and really shut the Rams
down. 133 and 7-4, “Each time it
was exceptionally awesome for us

because we met adversity and came
back to win,” remarked Coach Sade

all season we were able to do this,”

In the first game the Pioneers
were down by three runs entering the
fifth inning. However, the batwom—

the charge with a pinch—hit double

who launched another double, scor—

racked up three RBl’s as the team

In the second showdown, Grins

runs, once again in the fifth inning.
LiVi Lennrhan played a mayorrole as
she went thrcceforethree. “Both of
these wins were really a total team
effort,”commented Sadewater. “We
played very well as a unit,” Cathe—
rlrle Brown and Meg Jones pitched
the wins and Rathjen provided two
K's in the last three innings of the

second game.

Things did not remain so bright
for the Pioneers, however. as they
proceeded to beovetpowered byboth
Clarke and Monmouth in the latter
part or the week. Clarke made quick
work of the Pioneers, running both
games in five innings, 15.1 and 181.
The Pioneers were then bested by

She added, “Both of these teams were

Monmouth to achieve great things
in the conference tournament."
