A Changed Welcome

The campus on \iliich we start; this new year seems
lile a different world from the one we left in June. Mil-
«ls-it, dust, dingy halls, hidden piles of rubbish, smells, leaks,
etc, etc. have practically disappeared f and \ie are amazed,

This revolution in the condition of the residence halls
le' res us a little sheepish about all the gi'iping‘ we did in
'ig‘. As was promised. the unoccupied areas were made
ctinpletely livable for their new inhabitants, and student
lation did not increase beyond college facilities.

 

 

However, even now the job which was done seems
it possible, It was accomplished only by the strongest
ei urts of all the members of the physical plant and house-
l<e.,'iiig‘ sta who usually have s week summer raca-
{it s. Mcnibe of the foods staff, for example. spent all
summer finishing floors and nashing walls. The people

Welcome back to Grinnelll

Each of as 7 students,
faculty. and administrators#
are temporary custodians of
a long: and cherished tradir
tion. Our duty \i'hile \l‘e are
at nneli is to enrich that
tradi on through our daily
won and play, and in the
process to enrich our own
lives.

  

We are at the beginning);
of the 112th year of Grin—
iiell, I think this may be the
sear of a breakthrough \\'lle“l
we reach a new high in en-
cellence.

Our student body has been
carefully selected and is 940
strong: Oar faculty has been
augmented and is one of the '
best in the nation. Our ph_ ‘IC'dl plant is in the process of
drastic renovation and improvement. A new health center
and Lu o new pl' the fields are ready for use this fall. Bold
plans for the construction of a new library and a lien fine
arts center are in the making: Our alumni and trustees are
r dy to support us as neVer before. Our national reputa»
tion as an outstanding center of learning is gaming and
we are universally acclaimed as one of the significant libA
eral arts colleges.

But the quality of a great college is determined not
only by the external features of enrollments, building's,
mono}, and faculties. It is determined also by the spirit
that particles the institution.

In a good college, learning is respected, ideas are dis
cussed, truth is activehv sought, attitudes are democratic,
friends are loyal, the \i'ell'are of the community is a concern

 

   

 

 

 

, of all, and personal goals transcend mere selfeadvancemeiit

At the same time. in a good college there is plenty of good
humor, gaiety and fun. t

In all of these intangibles of spirit, Grinnell stands
hiirh. These are the ingredients of the great Grinnell tra—
dition. As custodians of this tradition, let us break through
to a new high in the spirit of our College,

Howard R. Bowen, President
