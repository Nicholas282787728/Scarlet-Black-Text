steady uphill game ii-om thestart.

, _ Armstrong and Turner played

The well; of the te m at Ma
son last Saturday wits a very pains
iul surprise. We Tnlly recognize
the (act that Wisconsin has the
strongest team that n Griiiiiell
eleven has ever played against.
The team is made up largely or
old experienced players who have
been on the gridiron tor ironi
three to ﬁve years. Such names
as “Ikcy” Karel. Richards, Ryan.
Atkinson and Nelson are among
the ﬁrst in football history. It is
seldom.—we may say with conﬁ-
dence. that never has any west-
ein college had such a brilliant
aggregation oi players on the

W football ﬁeld in a single year.

But while we recognize Madie
son's strength. still we cannot bee
lieve that any learn Iiastlie license
to score 54 points on Grinnell
while she was scoring but six
and those on a ﬂuke.

The work of the team was rags
ged and each man seemed to be
playing Ini- himself until Lindsay
scored the touch-down. Then the

. whole team pulled together and

played ball. That at least is an
encouraging tact. that they played
better football towards the end of
the game than at the beginning.
That shows that the players have
some of that “Grinnell pluck" in
them. They are not “qliitters”
and with hard work will perhaps
be able to retrieve some of their
lost honor.

Wisconsin has secured a valu-
able man ill Atkinson. He made
many of their long runs and was
very effective in breaking np our
interference, Karel. Richards,
and. in [act the whole Madison
team played with a snap and vim
that was eminently worthy of im~
itation. and which spoke well For
Phil King's coaching.

From what we can ﬁnd out
about the Madison game there
were but three men on the team
that played good ball. Douglass.
Macartncy and Lindsay played a

KIIIIIIIIIIII‘IIIIII IIIII

 

_ brilliantly at times but none of

the other men played any where
near the game or which they were
capable. They seemed to be
eithei scmed or intimidated.

We were clemly outclassed and
we give due weight to that fact.
but it is- one thing to be outclassed
and another thing to play ragged
ball. We hope that this defeat
will prove a lesson to the men
and that they will play harder
ball because of it.

It will perhaps be etinterest to
our readers to know the time in
which the touch-downs were
made. Madison made the ﬁrst
one in 1:20 minutes. and the secs
and after they had been playing
3:17; the third in 8:9; the fourth
in 19:46 and the last in 23:57. In
the second half. the ﬁrst one was
made in 5:10; the second in 8:52;
the third in 14:41 and the fourth
in 22:40. The time of the touch-
downs Show clearly that our boys
were taken completely off their
teet. and didn't get down to good
ball playing until the last part of
the game.

There are several criticisms we
wish to make which are in order
now. The ’varsity team :is slow
in getting out to practice. It is
usually ﬁfteen minutes to ﬁve bee
[ore the team lines up {or signal
practice and in consequence they
get less than thirty minutes act-
ual play against the scrub each
night. The scrubs scored on the
'varsity last night from the center

otthe ﬁeld on an end play. Pat-
terson making a beautiful run of
ﬁfty yards. This should never be
allowed to happen again. Capt.
Templcman put much snap into
the play last evening. but there is
still room for vast improvement.

Saturday afternoon the 'varsity
will line up against the scrubs for
a practice game. Two thirtycmin-
ute halves will be played and it
lvill be a hotly contested game
from start to ﬁnish. A large
crowd should be out to see the
team play and encourage them by
their presence.
