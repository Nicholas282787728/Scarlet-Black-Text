HOUSTON DOUCHARTY AT DISCO: Way to be groovy, House
tonl But next time come to Harris in your Disco clotliesiwe’ll

bet they’re authentic.

 

 

CELL PHONE RECEPTION In a way it’s refreshing to have places
on campus that don’t facilitate cell phone use On the other
hand, standing outside in the rain trying to get service is no fun,

 

 

 

POSTsTORNADO LINES: A tornado warning is traumatic
enough. Making students wait over 20 minutes to swipe their
P-cards again is just unnecessary.

 

 

Students speak
about what's on
their minds in 142
words or fewer,
and you're invited!
If you have a rant,
e-mail it to
[yorkkath]. Com-
plaining in a public
forum is always
more fun than do-
ing it alone.

Once more, with less pomp

Dear pompous people it Gunnou college,

The world does not noed your pomp, It is won-
derful that you have great seltvcstcenilut unfortu-
nately, you are also annoying. Please stop strutting,
tossing around unnecessarily large words, reciting;
youl'tcsumé in casual conilu'mtion,flankiugyotlrself
with other pompous intlividuills .md/or thinking
that I run bitchy fol culling vou out on this. You an
no hotter dun nnyunc clst httc Plonsc slop fulﬁll-
ing the stcrcutypo or Grinnell snidtius .is entitlcd
sclr- righteous, and arrogant young people Look
ntound you at Lht: probloms thit have hcen caused
by world leaders, business executives, ind edit: in-
telligcnt people who spend more time thinking and
hiking about how awesome they an: richer than
acting as a positive inﬂuence in the world without
getting credit for it.Tilke the time to consider h“,
rnility, and then, plense keep it to yourself.
