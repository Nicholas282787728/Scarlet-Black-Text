PESSIMIST

You’ve spent years building
Your reputation

For heaven’s sake
Don't smile now
Before the '72 elections,

President McGovern
President McGovern
Learning the taste of
The sound that can

Make me smile

THE LAKE

Oil the end of the dock

there is deep

brown water sucking

at the sunken posts,

on hands and knees, iace

against the night waters

you cannot see your reilection

Above the dark ﬁsh and sand,

just the spit water lights shimmering

from the Amusement Park across the lake.

FREE VERSE BY ROBERT
BROWNING

Borges wrote his poem ior Robert Browning,
I send it back.
I am the one that silence has chosen
again (the moon sings suspended
in suspended sky) and darkness reigns.
That poem returns light.
Now i will admit that Borges, too,
is Robert Browning, raging at all things,
carrying his own torch, blind
through the empty streets, a Homeric
rat who is always in the right.
But that Browning is a beggar
even choosing his calling
from the labyrinth
oi all things not his own,
ior all reason No, i am not a jacket
that anyone can wear, though l am being worn.
Borges, too, has another's vmce,
but lam not Byron, nor Wish to be.

And yet, otten while waiting
I have thought that I am a blue girl
with legs shining, or that
an egu's Walt Whitman is Britain’s own,
that I am a telephone operator
answering the wrong age. Even the absurd
has taken over my liie, like
the wronged Catullus, or the Merlin
of medieval time
Yes, I am whatever I am wished to be
and Borges is right
All men dead are whatever they are thought to be
{or all men dead are all things.
i have taken my place.
Borges wrote his porm ior Robert Browning.
Now he is the one.

COURT SUITE

lam in rhythm rough, stumbling

in over energy, no rule

to measure me but sometime pause;
modulation into galliard

irom estampie, light renaissance
leaping back to a more ancient air.

You, my gentle friend, are more sedate,
much deeper in the pulsing oi inside
smiling and lachrymae, SoIt sounds

oi lutes, mellow, hushed within your speech,
warm viol in the kindness oi your eyes ,
perhaps pavane, richly darkly known,

Together we are melody and bass.
The sadness oi your meter matches mine;
I complement your dreaming with a laugh
becoming music, lone accompaniment.
All our patterns gather to a suite,

The intermingled danse royale oi love,

Sherry Mayrent

many colored music;
much musical magic,

the splendor oi golden explosion
answered in the leaves.

it is late, it is autumn,

the world is a child

with wonder iilled eyes;

the air smells grey

and speaks at smoke.

Clouds climb, cascade,

leaves ialling ﬂy;

birdsong resembles silence,
Druids drone and drum.
mystery moves like love,

and light begins again.

Sherry Mayrent

The slight shaking shoulders
The sohs wringed out

and tears
Dropping train the iace

dripping
I could hold this Child
This girl: I could comfort
in stronger arms but
I’d need to touch her
Be more eloquent than words
And let her dampen my sweater with

tears

I am not man enough to have
Strength tor two

RUSH HOUR

After the hesitated step all the curb,
steel bodies all around you
bending the sun to your eyes
stopping and starting

hot rubber on gummy asphalt
flashing

a bedroom scene

cramp in the gut

shoving the hand

away from your breast

a curse and horns,

you remember

you are crossing the street.

GRANDPA AND THE IOWA
DRYSPELL

The dust was everywhere
on his land in '34

in the middle oi his years,

So when it settled iarms later

on his ilat brown shoes with curling leather,
collected in the corners oi his eyes,

made his tongue ieel like a cat’s,

he just went on piling it up

and sometimes things would grow

like the plums he never washed and ate.
But there was no more dust

Sunday mornings when she dressed him up
in his only suit

like some dog’ wearing a sweater-:-

atter all, God didn‘t come on Sundays

and what would He look like?

Soon the dust came back in a not swirl
clinging to the wings oi the bees

and velvet on the leaves or his grapes,
Maybe it was this

that made his wine cloudy;

anyway, no one knew then

what the wine did to him.

Alan Bensley

FARM

Sun-struck barn
painted white

empty with dust

and old hay dark

with closed doors,

the big maple broken

by the wind,

the walnuts broken

by the saw

when the old man

planted it

in his mind

corn and beans

nowadays

he 1ust stammers a lot

about the prairie tires

titty years ago in North Dakota.
