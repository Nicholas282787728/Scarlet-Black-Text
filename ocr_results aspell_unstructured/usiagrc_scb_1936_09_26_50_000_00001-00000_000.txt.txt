Tum Faculty Members
Carry Silver Instead
of Paper Dollars

Whenever a clerk in a Grinnell

TOUCHDOWN

store finds a silver dollar in the

cash register he knows that either
Prof. Cecil Lavcll or Prof. Ray-
mond McClenon has been shopping.

carrying silver dollars instead
of paper ones is Professor Lavell's
unique method of guarding against
loss, Several years ago, when he
returned from Colorado, where sil-
ver currency is always used, he
could not become accustomed to us»

ling paper money. Three successive

times, he pulled an extra dollar bill
from his pocket by mistake and
dropped it on the floor without no-
ticing it, After that, he returned
to using silver dollars.

“Silver dollars announce their
fall,” he explained. ”Also, they
are much cleaner to carry,"

Professor McClcnon likes the
substantial feeling of silver dollars
and uses paper money only in let
ters, He attributes the increase
in the use of paper money to the
increase in traveling.

The clerks in the Powcshiek Na-
tional bank and the Grinnell state
bank reach for silver dollars when
they see these two members of thc
Grinncll faculty coming to cash a
check. A supply is always kept on
hand for the two men, who are the
only depositors of the banks who
use them.
