merit"

Posters put up by Kent for tire
group Students Against Hippies
showed cartoons of protesters being
blown up and bore the slogans,
“Bohemians must be destroyed,“
“Go Home Hippies” and “Bleed,
Hippies. Bleed."

Kent said that four students 7
Peter Kazenoff, Eric Norton, Mat—
thew Morrison and Daniel Werner
— are in the process of ﬁling a
complaint with the college‘s ludi-
cial Council against him for putting
up the posters. Kent also said he is
also ﬁling counter-charges against
KazenoffandNorton.whoKentsays
tore down the posters in a violation
of his freedom of speech.

While SGA‘s resolution did not
mention Kent or Students Against
Hippies, discussion at the meeting
centered on the group and its post-
ers.

But Doug Hess, the representative
from Rawson Hall who introduced
the resolution, said “several events”
movedhimtoactincluding“aposter
approving of violence towards hip-
pies and demonstrators" and “-graf
frti in Burling Library saying, ‘Kill
Jews,’ ‘Kill Arabs.”

Kent, who spoke in his defense at
the SGA meeting, said that his
group’s posters weren’t harassing
anyone and that his right to free
speech is protected under guidelines
listed in the Student Handbook. The
Handbook prohibits “unwarranted
restriction of freedom of speech" on
campus.

“I don’t feel, specifically, the
posters relating to the Students
Against Hippies organization in-
fringe upon the rights of any com
munity members," Kent said. Kent
also urged loint Board to table the
resolution pending action by Jodi
cial Council.

“It may be advisable for the SGA
to wait on issuing an official posi-
tion or statement,” Kent said, until
Judicial Council has decided whether
the posters “constitute harassment.”

SGA president Rob Killion said
that the resolution only expresses
the opinion of SGA. “It‘s a non-
hindin g resolution,” Killion saidr“IL
in effect, makes a statement."

“It has no authority behind it.” he
Said.

ceedings would notbeinﬂneneed by
the resolution because it is not di-
rected toward anyone in particular.
She did, however, decline to com-
ment on the Judicial Council hear-
ings for fear of “persuading” the
Council “one way or another."

Ken! said in a prepared statement
released after the SGA meeting that
his group will continue to put up
posters and is prepared to take legal
action "to protect its right" to do so.

“The organization is prepared to
go outside the campus,” Kent said.
“This includes ﬁling suit if the col-
lege attempts toimpose any discipli-
nary action on the members of the
Students Against Hippies organiza-
tion for exercising their rights to free
speech,” he said.

Kent told The Scarlet and Black
Wednesday about the two pending
Judicial Council cases relating to
Students Against Hippies and its
posters. in the first case. Kentsaitl he
isbeingcharged withharassmentfor
putting up the posters. Kent said that
he is beingcharged by studentsPeter
Kazenoff, Eric Norton, Matthew
Morrison and Daniel Werner. Ka»
zenoffand Wcrner would not talk to
TheScarletandBlack aboutthecase.

In the second case, Kent is charg-
ing Kazenoff and Norton 7 who
Kent says tore down some of the
group‘s posters 7 with “unwar-
ranted restriction of speech," an act
prohibited by the S tudcntHandbook.

Judicial Council , composcdoftwo
faculty members and five students,
has jurisdiction over violations of
college rules.

According to Kent, Kazenoff and
Norton look down posters in Cowles
Hall and took them to resident ad-
viser Sandra Carter, who referred
them to the Office of Community
Rights. The Ofﬁce of Community
Rights operates out of the Office of
Student Affairs. '

No one in either the Office of
Community Rights or Student Af-
fairs was available [or comment

yesterday.

Kent said Community Rights
wanted to bypass Judicial Council
and hear the case directly but SGA
president Killion objected, saying it
should go through student channels.

The posters in question show car-
toon characters SpottheWonderDog
blowing up a group of demonstra-
tors and Bill the Cat saying about
hippies, “You must kill them." Other
posters read “Bohemians must be
destroyed," “Just say no to granola”
and “Let’s mine the Nollen House
lawn."

“It was in an obviously humorous
context," Kent said. ”There was no
malicious intent“

The resolution passed by SGA
states: “The JointBoard oftheGrin-
nell Student Government Associa-
tion condemns the public encour»
agement, inany mannerwhatsocver,
of violence against any community
membcr(s). Joint Boards View is
that espousal of violence against
community membcr(s) via a public
medium constitutes harassment and
should be treated as such.

“Furthermore, it is the opinion of
thislointBoard thatsuch matters are
to be taken seriously by the campus
community and that such encour»
agementof violence should never be
viewed as a form of comic expres—
sion."

Under guidelines in the college’s
Student Handbook. harassment and
“threats ofharm” can result“in sane-
tions up to and including expulsion
from the student body.”

Kent said that the resolution "calls
into question" the activities of the
Society for Creative Anachronism,
contact sports teams and the martial
arts club, as well as violent campus
films such as Lethal Weapon.

Doug Hess said that the resolution
wasdcsignedsimplytocondemnthe
encouragement of violcnce.

“if this type of encouraged vio-
lence continues on campus we should
keep making, resolutions,” Hess said.

for not coming to Grinnell, the insti-
tution should consider and evaluate
what it is willing to do to acquire
more minority faculty.

Scott said. “If you take the Malcolm

Scott said.

“It does not mean that individuals

the outome continues to be white

not diverse. The breakdown hap-
pens at the deparu'nental level,“ she
said.

lems." he said.

Last week’s meeting. said Scott,
allowed the college to examine the
faculty recruitment process together
with the staff and the committee.

“The potential for power and hope
lies in looking at the process," she
said.

Drake agreed that part of the solu-
tion to theproblem lies in emphasiz-
ing the positive aspects of the Grin»
nell environment rather than the
negative.

“lfwedwcil on thedifﬁcultics,we
defeat ourselves," he said.

Scott also pointed out thatthe lack

she said.

Jodi Hcswr, assistant director and

number of minority faculty is re-
quired to achieve a greater cultural
balance.

the awareness of Grinnell College in
minority communities is also a solu-
tion — the utilization of faculty and
students in making sure we tap into
communities where there are large
numbers of minorities,” she said.

And faculty and staff pointed out
that the term minority refers to all
people of color 7 not only blacks,
but Asians, Latinos and Native
Americans as well.

“Let's face it. there aren't many
role models of people of color on
campus — people similar to minor-
ity students in terms of past experi-
ences.someonetobethereforthem,”
said Hester. Hester, a recent Grin-
nell graduate. said that the low
number of minority faculty makes
the idea of role models difficult.

“Minority faculty members can
suffer burnout just because there
aren’t enough of them," she added.
This semester, there are three black
faculty members; two are tenure-
u-ack. the other is a scholar in resi-
dence.

“This is the lowest number ever,"
said Scott, who cited the 25 percent
faculty turnover rate and the break-
down of the revolvingrdoor system
# the consistent gain/loss ratio of
faculty. '

”Thereisnoreasonthat 10percent ,
of the faculty can‘t be Afro-Ameri-

firmative-action issue. which is a
legal and political issue. This is the
recruitment of faculty. which is an
academic and social issue," said
Scott.
