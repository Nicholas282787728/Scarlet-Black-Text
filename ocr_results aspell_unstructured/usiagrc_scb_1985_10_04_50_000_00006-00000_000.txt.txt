new coaches lllSllll‘B onllmlsm

By Howard Lange

This season the Grinnell iootball team
welcomes three new assistant coaches to
its staff, all ot whom are enthusiastic addi-
tions to the Ploneer efforts,

Andy Hamilton. who coaches the
linebackers, is a Grinnell iootball player
turned coach. After graduating last spr-
ing, he came back to live in Grinnell to
teach lilth grade in the Tama school
system and to coach iootball at Grinnell

Hamilton 5 very deep attachment to the
Pioneer iootball program explains why he
returned to Grinnell “1 put my heart and
soul in as a player and hadn t seen much
progress in the win/loss ratio. 1 ielt like
things will change in the near iuture, it not
this year and i wanted to be a part oi that.
Also, I wanted to remain in football.“

He asserted that,the team ”has the
potential to behighly competitive, and that
w ill be realized this year."

line would think that a man trying to
coach lormer teammates might rind some
diiiiculty in establishing the proper coach-
player rapport, but irom Hamilton's View-
point there has been little problem in his
in aking the sivitch lrom player to coach.
“Most oi the players were conscious or
what my new role on the team was."
l-l amilton said

The transition has been lacilitated by the
tact that most ol the players with whom
Hamilton works are lreshmcn, and so do
not know him as a player. Hamilton did
allow, however, that some oi the older
players have had a ditticult time adjusting
to his new position.

Hamilton sees the large team S|Ze and
the determination oi the players and
coaching stalf as the team's prime asses.
“The 55 players and live coaches are a
hard working group dedicated to bringing
a reputable iootball program to Grinnell.
By reputable I mean a winning team, but
one which at the same time does not

sacriiice academic excellence

In Hamilton s mind the greatest liability
ol the team does not come lrom within but
irom without. He complained that ”There
is a lot ot negativism ttowards the Grinnell
iootball teaml irom state wide
newspapeis other college coaches people
in toivn. and people on campus. The
[negatlvlsm] was a lrustratioii 1 had when
l was a player as well."

Hamilton says that his career goals do
not liein coaching, and that he is entertain
in g many possibilities, including teaching,
business, and missionary work. As lar as
h is luture goes, he stressed that “1 will go
w herever the bord takes me,”'For now at
least, and probably lor a couple more
years. the Lord has him at Grinnell, and he
seems more than happy to stay iora while

The defensive line coach, Lowell Cooper,
also a junior high mathematics teacher
a nd Baptist minister in Des Moines. comes
to Gi-iniiell with experience both at the
high school and semiprolessional levels.
E ven though Cooper lives in Des Moines.
he took the position on the Grinnell iootball
stall because “I have aspirations to coach
o n the college level,"

Like Hamilton, Cooper prolesses high
hopes lor the team. When asked to come
pare the Pioneers with the rest oi the con-
lerence. Cooper replied, "I would putus on
the same level with any team in the con~
lerence." He did point out, though, that it
is a young team. in relerence to the nor
m ally large compliment oi ireslimen, and
that “there is a period of seasoning which
in ust take place," with the proper season
ing. Cooper sees great potential in the
team.

what Cooper enjoys most about
coaching here is Grinnell's coaching
philosophy 7 that academics come iirst.
“I enjoy the tact that our concentration is
lirst on education. and then on playing

As to what he enjoys least about
coaching at Grinnell. Cooper's comment
w as. “I haven't lound anything yet. 1 even
Ilke driving back and forth from Des
M olnes."

Cooper's enthusiasm for Grinnell does
not stop at football, but pervades his entire
p erception ol the college, Cooper summed
up his leelings when he'said, “I love it!"
H e enjoys Grinnell and the people here so
n1 uCh that he may seek out a more permas
n ent position on the stall.

:‘Hopelully an opportunity will present’
itself where I can do more than just coach
h ere." Cooper explained that he would be

he is qualified. whether that be on the
laculty or in the administration,

A University or Iowa graduate and
lormer Hawkeye iootball player. Czer-
n iakowskl came to Grinnell because it was
a good opportunity to coach on a part time
h asis while he works on his master's
degree in physical education at lowa.

Czerniakowski agrees with Cooper that
the team has great potential to win, but
that right now it is still quite young. l-le
Li Sserts that, ”It's justa matter of teaching
them what they need to know" in order to
bring them to victory.

When asked what kind of impact has
been made on the team so far, Czerr
n Iakowski explained that the coaches have
tried to give the team a great deal ol cons
lidence and organization. something which
w as sorely lacking in the past. “Weive acs
eomplished that." said cierniakowski.
“a nd the kids are well prepared when they
go out on the field.”

He blames the players’ past lack of c0n~

tidence on peer attitude. “The kids Can see

m any more kids out lor the sport than at ,
G rinnell. We try to tell the kids that those
things don’t matter."

Czerniakowski enjoys coaching at Grins
iicll immensely, both lor the iootball pro
gram and for the college itsell. and what
he enjoys most is the seeming desire or
everyone associated with the program 7
from coaches to B&Cr men 7 to turn it
a round into a winning team What he sees
a s a problem is one ol time. ”We don’t get
the same amount oi practice time that
other schools have." When questioned as
to whether or not he thought the team
should have more pract' e time. Czers
ii iakowski stressed that "academics come
first." but also mentioned that players are
encouraged to work out ways to get to

'pl‘actlce on time The greatest academic

c onilicts lor players are labs which go well
o ver their allotted periods

As a closing remark. Czerniakowski
stated. "l hope people will continue to back
us. good or bad. and we have a distinct
poss ility oi winning our share or games
lhis season We don't want people to think.
though. that once we start winning that we
a re decreasing our emphasis on education
i hope people will understand that these
are the same quality students, but that we
just have better quality recruiting."

ll nothing else, all three new coaches
will add a much needed torrent oi ens
thusiasm to the iootball team. in light of
their uncompromising opinion that Grin-
n ell will see a winning iootball season this
y ear, the question had to be asked, “What
will you do il you dont win7' The-ins
evitable answer came lrom Hamilton,
w hose unsquelchable optimism by lar ex-
c eeds the other two.

“It's never going to happen."
