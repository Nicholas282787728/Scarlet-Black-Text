A College Press Sonics.

The fact that several of the most
important events of the present Col,
lege year and those which would he
of greatest importance to the College
by way of advertising have railed to
receive mention outside or local cir—

cles and [he further fact that some of
those accounts which have reached
the stale papers have DEE!) a. triﬂe dis-
torted, have brought to a point this

The local correspuud‘eilts [or the
stale papers have covered well, al~
though, at times somewhat sensation»

affairs, the eminent musicians who

other schools and which are of illeS»
timable advertising value' among a

The irconcnt
