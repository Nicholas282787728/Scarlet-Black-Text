O The Gates Lectures

Finding an answer, or even formulating an
intelligent question concerning spiritual
realities in a constantly changing external
world has always been of primary interest
to Grinnell students. That is why the Gates
Memor l lectures appeal to the thinking
Grinnellian as a privilege and a challenge

Although seldom do students find in
these lectures Specific, concrete solutions

no. Crowder

to the crisis which they must face per-
sonally as well as nationally and interna—
tionally, they do find their thinking tre-
mendously stimulated and elevated abqve
the commonplaceness of every day living:

The lectures which Dr. Bernard Iddings
Bell delivered this week prove that the 1941
Gates Memorial lectures are no exception to
the established Grinnell tradition of cogent
and distinctive presentations

0 Shades of Brahms

The too-long slumbering souls of Brahms,
Beethoven and Tscllaikowsky will soon be
revived with a vengeance if the Crescendo
club has any say about it.

Anyone who likes to hear good music
played the way it should be will have only
to climb the three ﬂights of stairs in the
music building to hear the selections of his
choice played by world famed orchestras or
sling by renowned vocalists. .

It is possible that many Grinnell students
do not realize the extent of the resources
at their disposal in the form of the Carnegie
music set. To the original 640 records pro-
vided with the record player itself, many
more records have since been added,

The Crescendo club is conducting a sur-
vey of students and faculty members to de-
terlnine how many additional records will
be available for the proposed music Seances.
Programs requested by students will be
posted in advance, and at specified hours
concerts will be given.

Anyone who has heard the Carnegie
music set in operation knows what a
beautiful performance it gives. Here is the
answer to even the humblest music lover’s
desire for practically unlimited selection of
records and a smooth recording medium.

 

Four Albums of

Four new albums of vocal records
have recently been added to the

Another album, containing Songs
of the northland sung by Kirsten
Flagstad, was also presented by
the Crescendo club.

An album of arias and. duets
from Mozart operas, sung by Ezio
Pinza and Elizabeth Rethberg,
was purchased by the music de-
partment, Wirtz said,

About 60 records were purchas»

E. B. T. Spencer collection, Wirtz
said.

Believe ltor Not

(with apologies to Ripley)

A photograph of yourself is the only
plesent you can give which nobody

else can duplicate.

Also it saves you time and wolry—
one Sitting, and your Christmas shop-
ping is over. Nobody will have to run
down to exchange ‘your’ gift and no-
body will have any hard feelings.

And what is more ‘personill’ than a
photograph of ‘you’?

Have your sitting early while we still have plenty of

time.
