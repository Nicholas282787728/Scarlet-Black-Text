Minneapolis, Minn—The universi-
ty of Minnesota has received a
proposal of “marriage" not di-
rectly from the stately and beau-
tiful Durham university in Eng-
land, but indirectly through Dr.
Stephen F. Duggan. director of
the institute of International Ed-
ucation.

Seemingly the phrase “married”
originated on the British side,
The Institutes proposal has gone
to sixteen American universities,
whose mates in t ese unions
would be sixteen Bri sh universi-
ties, other than Oxford, cam-
bridge or the London School of
Economics.

In correspondence with Presi-
dent Walter c. Coffey, Dr. Dug-
gaii explained that most Ameri-
can students going to Britain to
study enter one of the last three
universities. Broader internation-
al understanding would be creat-
ed, he suggested, if students e
tered other good British universi-
ties.

The proposal is that the paired
institutions each accept a student
from the other and pay his tui-
tion and living expenses while he
‘or she is in residence. Dr. Dug.
gan expressed a belief he could
find institutional benefactors,
such as foundations, to pay the
costs of travel.

At Minnesota the proposal is
under consideration, but final ap-
proval has not yet been given.
The arrangement would not go
into effect until after the war.

Denver. Col A program of ain-
line education is being introduced
into the curriculum of the uni-
versity of Denver this fall, in co-
operation with the large airlines
of the United States, Dr. Ben M.
Cherrington, chancellor of the un-
iversity, has announced.

It is expected that increased,
traffic. lower transportation costs,‘
and greater international use of
airlines will necessitate even great-
er numbers to meet the needs of
the airlines. Whereas it took
five persons on the ground to as-
sist in the operation of each do-
mestic plane in night seventeen
years ago, more than fifty-four
persons are required today for‘
this purpose.

The program includes training
for positions as hostesses on com-
mercial airlines, dispatchers, res-
ervation and space control ag-l
ents, flight service clerks, meteo-
rologists, passenger agents and
airplane designers. They may
also train for secretaries, person-
nel administration, accountants
and auditors, teletypc operators
and general clerks.

The facilities of the United Air-
lines, Continental Airlines, Branr
iff Airlines and the Municipal}
,Airport will be used for labora-
tory purposes. Faculty will be
made up from the university staff
and Airline personnel.

Ada. oniofA new approach to
the study of government through
systematic newspaper reading has
just been introduced here by Dr.
W. E. Binkley, professor of polit-
ical science at Ohio Northern un-
iversity.

The students clip current news
stories of governmental activi-
ties, national, state. municipal
and county. They analyze these,
indicating the steps preceding and
following the present stage of
the particular operation in the
story.

"To many beginning students,“
says Dr. Binltley, "a text book on
government is puzzling because
it deals with matters as remote
from their attention as the ca-
nals on the planet Mars, I be-
lieve that persistent daily contact
with current governmental hap-
penings will convince the, that
the text book deals with living
realities."

165 Quad Guests
1 nMurch Reach
New HighRecord

The number of guests staying
overnight in the quadrangle has
grown to quite an amazing fig-
ure. According to a recent com-
pilation made by Miss Gardner’s
office, a total of 195 guests stay-
ed in the quadrangle during the
month of March.

The number of actual guests
cause the total was based on the
number of guests each night, re-
gardless of how many nights
0f the March to-
tal, 24 of the guests were pros-
pective students.

The total for the first semes-
ter was 278 guests. During the
month of November alone,
quadrangle had 125 overnight
guests,
the second semester with 273
guests have almost equalled the
first semester total.

Mrs. Ferguson, head of the
housekeeping department, has an-

lnounced that the number of week

end guest beds shall be limited
to 25. This includes beds in guest
rooms and cots put in student
rooms, but linen for guests using
student beds and studio couches
will be furnished as usual. All
reservations should be made
through Mrs. Blake by 11:00 on
the morning the guest is to an
rive.

‘Infanﬁle Paralysis
Foundaiion Gives
Fund For Training

To Remedy Shorfag‘e
Of Physical Therapisls

A critical shortage of qualified,
physical therapists which endan-
gers the proper care of infantile
paralysis victims has caused the
National Foundation for Infantilel
Paralysis to appropriate $1,257-
600 for the training of these vi-
tally needed specialists, Basil
O’Connor, president, announced
today. ‘

Present day medical treatment
of patients with infantile paraly-
sis demands more and more
physical therapy. Mr, O‘Connor
explained. “A physical therapist
is a technician who uses physical
agents such as heat, electricity,
light, exercise, rest, muscle train-
ing and similar methods in con-
trast to the use of drugs, bio-
logical and surgical technics.

“Today there are only 2,500
qualified physical therapists, of
whom more than half are in the
armed forces. It is estimated that
an additional 5,000 could be uscdi
right now. not only for the treat-
ment of infantile paralysis, but
also for aiding recovery from
many other diseases and disa-
bilities."

l

New Program

The $1,267,600 program devel-
loped under the guidance of ai
special committee established ini
the field of physical therapy con-
sists of three parts: 1, $1,107,000
for scholarships to train new
physical therapists; 2. $82,000 for
fellowships to provide additional
teachers. and 3, $78,600 for gen-
ieral development of the field of
physical therapy.

“We feel," said Mr. O'Connor.
“that this step constitutes one of
the outstanding contributions
which the American public has.
made through the March of Dimes
ito the fight against infantile par-
,alysis

1 “The National Foundation since
t was organized in 1938"has
ispent up to now more than a;
million dollars in the develop-
-ment of die fields of physicall
medicine and physical therapy.

To Provide Personnel ,
”This new program is designed;
to provide urgently needed per»,
sonnel necessary to fulfill the
National Foundation’s pledge that
complete medical care will ‘be
assured, so far as possible. for
infantile paralysis victims, re-
gardless of age, race, creed, colorl
or lack of financial ability tol
pay for services rendered."
Preparation for entrance into
approved schools of physical
‘therapy requires graduation as all
nurse, or physical educator, or
two years' college training in-i
eluding biology and other basic
sciences. Applications for schol-
arships should be made to The
National Foundation for Infant-
ile Paralysis, 120 Broadway, New
York 5, New York.

Lots of funny things have hap-
pened since last week at this
timeiespeclally in the volley ball
tournament The six games on
Saturday brought a number of
surprises, not the least of which
was the victory Cleveland claim-
cd from Read, 37 to 33.

James bowed to Heines by al
score of Haines, 41, James, 29.l
Haines won its second game Sat-
urday from Main, 63-15. Main al-
so lost to Cleveland, 56-18. Mears,
28, James, 39, and Mears, 21,
Read, 56, finished the list of,
games for Saturday.

Wednesday afternoon Cleveland
took one step more toward the

l

51 to 33. Read triumphed ovci-l
Haines 41 to 26. ‘

Then Thursday afternoon cleve-
land brought home the bacon.-
After showing well in every intra-
mural tournament all year, they
finally took top honors, leaving
Haines behind in a 37-29 victory,
and winning over Mears 35-23.
Going through all five of their
games undefeated, Cleveland
showed fine spirit, as well as ex-
pert ball handling.

Also Thursday afternoon James‘
surprised everyone, including
James, by beating Read with a
score of 47 to 20. This can be
explained in part by James' team-
work and fighting spirit; and in
part by lack of spirit on Road's
part. In the first half there was
hope, and by the half the score
was 19 to 11, but through the sec-
ond half they kept wilting, down
to a 47-20 defeat.

As it stands now there are two
games to be played in order to
finish the tournament. These are
Main-Mears, and Read-Main. We
can be pretty safe in saying that
Read will probably defeat Main,
since Main hasn't won a game so
far. The Mears game is still a
question mark. because Mears
hasn't won a game yet either.
