Lookabaugh
Not Satisfied
With Pioneers

Play
Carinnell Practices
for Washhurn

Offensive Pioor;

By Wells Barnett

Expressing dissatisfaction over
the Ploneers’ play in the first half
against Carleton last Friday,
Coach Guy Lookabaugh set him-
self this week to the task of pre»
paring the Grinnell grid squad to
meet a fairly strong Washburn
college team at Topeka, Kan, Fri-
day night.

Lockabaugh pointed out yester-
day that Grinnell had fumbled too
frequently in the first half. He
also found fault with the passing
in die first half, when intercep-
tions put the Pioneers in a couple
of bad spots, ”The blocking, too,
was spotty at times,” Lookahaugh
said, "as was the tackling, but at
other times the boys looked as
though they really knew some-
thing abount fundamentals."

Seldotterbeck May Start

With Lynn Schlotterbeck back
in good physical condition, the
backfield will probably be changed,
Lookahaugh believes. Schlottere
heck will probably start at one of
the halfback posts, with Evans at
the other, Show at quarter and
Bill Sampson at fullback.

“There is a slight possibility
that Barker may start in Schlot-
terbeck's place," Lookabaugh said.
in which case Schlotterbeck will
be held in reserve until he can he
of the most value to the team.

In case Barker does not start, it
will be necessary for John Hay-
ward to play at Burke Power's
end position, in order that the
Pioneers will have a dependable
punter on the field, otherwise,

The Y. w. C. A, cabinet spent its
meeting last night trying to be
clever on order, and hopes to have
a substitute within a week.

New Rules
Compiled

Outline Duties of Co-ed’s
Social Chairmen

An outline of the duties of the
women's social chairmen has been
compiled by Marian Wood, cha -
man of the social budget commit-
tee, and Rita Phelps, chair-man last
year, and now adviser from the
League board.

“It is more an outline of duties
than a set of rules," Miss Phelps
remarked. “Its aim is to aid the
cottage social chairmen; to give
them a code of duties that would
simplify indiVldual responsibility.”

This movement is a continuation
of an attempt begun last spring
to unify the social chairmen as a
quadrangle committee The com-
mittee may be called upon for aid
at any time by the social budget
committee, but is a distinct organ—
ization,

One of the special duties of the
social chairman is the preparation
of a report following each house
party. Reports are filed for refer—
ence of future social chairmen for
determining plans, budgets, and
procedures for future houseapar-
ties. The first reports, made by so-
cial chairmen last semester, are on
file for this semester's chairmen to
use.

p. m. in the quadrangle recrea—
tion room, according to Shirley
