Qﬁhitotinl

WHAT is the object of a course
in a modern American college?
The spirit in which the student
answers this question determines
to a large extent his tuture worth
or wortlllessness, It is a question
which should presentitself to ev-
ery student in the institution. Is
the acquisition of knowledge and
the general development of the
mental power the end aimed at or
is the possession of a Latin diplo-
ma the goal? The answer is evi-
dent. But the error of supposing
that the best development is to be
gained merely by poring over
text books to “get" the assigned
lessons and neglecting everything
else must also be avoided. The
value of hard study should not be
underestimated but nevertheless
it is not the only means of deriv-
ing beneﬁt from a college course.
Some of the most beneﬁcial op-
portunities in college lite arequitc
outside of the class room and it is
left entirely to the choice of the
individual student whether or not
he will take advantage of them.
Among these that of hearingleet—
dies by men prominent in the
pulpit or on theplatform is per-
haps the most valuable. Such a
chance is presented to the stu—
dents or Iowa College next week
in the course or lectures by Rev.
]. B. Koehne who comes here by
the invitation of Pres. Gates. The
course is known as the Nazarene
Lectures and presents the eviden-
ces of Christianity. lt comprises
six lectures, two of which will be
given toeniorrow, one in the morn-
ing and the other in the evening,
The remaining tour will occupy
the hour from seven to eight on
the next four evenings. These
lectures are entirely free and all
students and townspeople are not
only invited. but urged to attend.
That there may be plenty etioom
for all who desire to hear this
coilrse, it will be given in the
Congregational church, but it
must be understood that the audie
ence is expected to be on time.
On Friday evening a lecture will

be given entitled “New Aristoc-
racy," for which all iKllllisNiOll {cc
will be charged In orrlel to meet
the lectiirer‘s expenses, Although
this one isnot organically eoiiiiccte
ed with the course, it doubtless
will be largely attended. Mr.
Koehne is well known as a lecte
iirer. this being his fourth year in
that vocation, His desire is to
visit colleges especially and he
has prepared liislectui-es vith this
end In view which will niakethem

dent of Brown University. will lec-
ture in theCongregational church
on Friday evening, Dec. i7. His
subject will be “Robert E. Lee”
which is generally considered his
best lectuie. During the war Dr.
Andrews was a Union soldier, but
he learned to admire the greatest
of all the Southern heroes, and on
the platform he delineates the
character of this famous man in
the most vivid and realistic man-
ner, speaking as he does from an
entirely unprejudlced standpoint.
The lecture has been received
with the greatest enthusiasm and
admiration both in the North and
in the South.

As an educator and thinker,
Pres. Andrews stands among the
foremost, and he isaman of whom
not only New England but the
whole country is proud. It is to
his efforts and character that
Brown University is indebted for
its remarkable growth and ad-
vancement.

DL Andrews comes under the
auspices of the Y. M C. A. The
admission to the lecture including
reserved seats, will be 50 cents
Tickets may be obtained from any
member of the Lecture Course
Committee or at Beard 8: Alley's
