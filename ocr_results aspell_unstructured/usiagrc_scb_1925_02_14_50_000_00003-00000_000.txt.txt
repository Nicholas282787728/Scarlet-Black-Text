iircst as it would be to ask a freshman
entering college to accept as true the
entire cur -iculunl before he had studs
ied it. Christ did n at ask Zachaeus
ti: accept to elaborate creed, merely
a war of life."

Fosdick's great motto for uhr ans
is “Follow the light that you have.
I do not ask you. that before you start
to became a Christian, that you see all

*1 that I see, but that you start with

what you Cdu see and follow that until
you can see further. i had a great
ﬁght for religious faith. As a young
man I couldn‘t imagine what denomlr
nation would take me, .' . cdht’ yet,
sometimes," he added, w ill the sugS‘
gestlon of a grin, and brought down
the house. “But the light has been
been an ascending path. Begin being
a Christian where you are."

Tire author of the famous “Twolrc

Tests of Character" believes that poo.
pl ear-e going to ho ChrisHike merely
trying, “All psycholog sts' know this
to be true, that we grow like the pew
ple we live with. Habitually, inceslt
santly, unavoidably, this is true. Sonic
people are not giving Christ a challee.‘
What kind of a life are you livrn'gl.
There is just one ultimate secret of
character building. Rememh - this,
that evewwthorn that ever pierced the
brow oi Christ grew in some sluggard's
garden."

Dr. Fosdick completed his series of
lectures Friday morning when he
spoke on the subject, “Christianity and
the World." lay request the Men's Glee
club opened the service with "The
Bells of St. Mary's.” Following this
number, president Mom, in behalf of
the Grillnell townspeople and the col—
lege, expressed a few words of sincere
appreciation of Dr, Fosdick's visit.
The Gates lecturer replied that it was
truly Friday the thirteenth for him
because it was the day when he was
to leiwe Grluilell and his many now
friends. "No man is the whole 01"
himself, _His friends are the rest of,
lilm." - ,‘

Anuclurir Roligiou ,
The great easterner began the body
of his talk with reference to the old
mediasval idea of life, "a shack that
we will only use for a night, so that it
makes little difference if the roof
leaks and sanitary conditions are not
perfect. At the risk of shocking a
great many pious souls that may be
present, I say. look out for a religion“
that is made of faith alone. Beware
of the a‘rmchair religion with its blind
faith in God, and its utter disregard
of the call to service. It has often
been said the perversion of the bes
is the worst." . . .
Fasdick spoke of a sign that had

been posted in Moscow, a quotation
from Carl la x, the great socialist,
“Religion is the opiatc of the peo-
ple.” The noted risitor claims that
this attitude is onc which can not he
kept in Russia. ”The attitude of
resignation has gone too for in fee
ligion. It is the same feeling that
caused people to fight the introduction
of umbrellas because they thought
that if it was the will or God to send
rain, people ought to he willin to
get wet. The same thing was true
when slai- y was first thought of.
Now we have learned that the right in»
tcrprctation of t . will be dollc' tics

the desert with its vast arid waste.“

Are we resigned? No, we send for the
engineer to use his fl-nct lg melts
sill-es. “Tlly will he donc.‘ "

A Flag to rollow

There are some ideas that the
Christians of today rrrust change, tics
cording to the great preacher. " '6
can trust God, but we can not trust
God to break his own laws. I trust
God, but i don't make it an arm-chair
philosophy to he cozy in. The wllole
business of this cosmos is law-like.
I trust that the universe is good at its
heart. 1 leap to a great confidence
that life is good at its center, but that
is no arm-chair philosophy. it is
flag that you must follow; Us s cm»
sade to make; it’s a bottle to fight."

It rs the active Christianity that
Fosdlck commends. Speaking of war,
he said, “I want unrcsigned Christians
on the subject of war and internatiolr
al problems. i stand in awe of the
remark that Jesus made when he said,
“All those that take up thc sword shall
perish by the sword This propos-
ition did not look to be true then, but
is accepted as such today. Lord
Bryce, than whom there is no greater
living autho on the subject of war,
says, ‘If mankind docs not cud war.
WM will end mankind: There is
too great a tendency abroad todn to
be apathetic towards the po hub
of the next war which, if it comes
about, i ll be the 'most prodieious
thing in lristo "

Isolation impossible

The distinguished theologian has
very positive views concerning the
“splendid isolation” policy of America:
“Thomas Jefferson said that he hoped
that we would not have anymore to
do with Europe than we have to do
with China, which all goes to show
that he didn't know how much we
were going to have to do with the
Chinese."

“Today the question of isolation is
more than a question of geography."

Concerning the prospects for anolllerr
war, Fosdick said, “Either we’ve got‘
to "tit there first with substitutes for-
\ u- or else we‘ll have war. Ami if
onollrcr wlu' does come it will shattcr
the foundations of c' ation. Let.

thing will come to pass."

From Violence. in Co-opcratiou

To Fnsdick, all social progress in
past ages has come as a result of the
transference of social institutions
from the area or violence to the area
of cooperation. "Tho next step in
social progress today will come by
this smile method of ca :2 interna—
tional affairs from the area of r—lo—
lcncc to the area or cooperation.
Where do ’you standi Are you for-
Christ or anti Christ? Wherever
people are working for such things as
