Town and Gown: the two Grinnolls

When one hears the word ”Grinnell" mentioned, one
almost always assumes that the word is used as a short
form of “Grinnell College.” It is a rarity, indeed, to find
among us students someone who thinks of “Grinnell” as
having anything to do with Grinnell, Iowa.

What follows is taken from an editorial in the April 16
edition of the Grinnell Herald-Register:

Let’s see. . . what’s happened so far this year at Grinnell Col-
lege?

Several things come to mind: the appearance of diplomat and
Soviet expert George Kennan, discussions by Democmctic
presidential candidates, the diverse views expressed by former
Black Panther Bobby Scale and conservative William Rasher,
and most recently, the highly successful sports symposium
whose participants included such luminaries as Sir Roger Ban-
nister and Alan Page.

That only scratches the surface, of course. In addition, there
have been countless concerts, there have been plays, and there
have been art exhibits.

The point is that the college’s annual Town and Gown cam-
paign is getting underway in earnest here, and once again we
would like to urge Grinnellians to contribute generously.

By now, the arguments are familiar. Anyone who ‘has taken
part in previous drives knows that the college is a major
employer with a significant economic impact upon the communi-
ty as a whole. In today’s edition, for example, we’re running a
story which points out that 2,800 persons will come to the com-
munity to take part in various programs during June and July
alone. Those participants spend money while they’re in town.

But so do the_students who attend classes throughout the
academic year. Without them, Grinnell would be a poorer place
— notjust financially, either, The students enrich the communi-
ty in more ways than one.

The important thing about Grinnell College’s presence here,
however, is that it is so culturally enriching. All those concerts,
plays and stimulating debates are priceless, as is the use of the
Physical Education Complex, a marvelous facility the college has
opened to the public. Such things deserve the thanks of the c0m~
munity. . , l

So once again, we hope that participation in this year's Gown
and Town campaign is generous. Contributions are investments
in the future ofa fine institution and the community as a whole,

After college, we may never again have the opportunity
to enjoy life in a town like Grinnell. Make an effort on
some pleasant Spring day to get beyond Park Street and
discover for yourself some of the people and things that
make this town so special.

The Town and Gown campaign is a great gesture by the
community to help the college, and we students should
learn more about our generous neighbors in town. After
all, the college isn’t the only thing in Grinnell that is
culturally enriching.

Liberals;
the NRA

and gun *-

by Ben Johnston

This is an excellent time to ad»
dress the issue at gun control, No
\vellrknown figures have been shot
recently and hopeiully this will
allow the issue to be examined
without much at the emotion nor-
mally associated with it.

The issue oi gun control has it’s
fair share at fanatics on both
sides. However. it is the liberal
who is supposed to be open-
minded. but when one tries to
argue gun control with a liberal,
one is likely to hear logic which is
generally thought to be sole pror
perty oi antrbirlh control. antir
abortion advocates and Phyllis
Schalley supporters,

To begin with. whatwould bannr
ing handguns accomplish‘7 First,
it creates a whole new class at
criminals out of law ablding gun
owners who refused to turn in
their guns. There is one handgun
for every four women, men. and
children in th United States One
cannot seriously believe that it
would be possible to confiscate
every one of the guns and destroy
them.

lithe government could not Conn
trol alcohol during prohibition and
cannot control recreational drugs
now. how is it possibly going to
prevent the sale. production. and
possession of handguns?

A favorite antlrhandgun argu-
menl is that handguns are banned
in Europe and Japan and these
places have surprisingly low
murder rates. Taiwan has hanr
dgun controls at least ii not more
strict than Japan's. yet in Taiwan
the murder rate is phenominally
high. They simply use other
means of killing one another

A highly armed populace does
not mean the country will have a
high murder rate. Switzerland
and Israel have two of the lllghesl
rates or iirearm ownership and
yet lheu‘ murder rates are surr
prisingly low.

People also argue that han-
dguns should be banned because a
lot oi people kill themselves ac-
cidenlly wlth handguns it is easy
to see why the NRA would take of-
tense at this stand. Most NRA
members own handguns. Typical
1y. those NRA members that do
own handguns do not have ace
Cidents With them

In NRA»type iamilies. children
learn early in lilo that a gun is not
a toy. They learn how to use them
and they learn respect ior them.
The guns are not kept in a shoe
box somewhere but out in the
open.

The NRA would be justifiable in
arguing mat the accident was
simply social darwinism People
that don tknow a thing about guns
have no business owning them

which brings me to my final
pomt. Liberal gun control types
and the NRA have an Interest in
making it mandatory that a per
son show competence with a
broom belore she can buy it The
NRA doesn't want a bunch of
idiots out there owning guns any
more than liberals do. The NRA
just wants to make sure that they
will be allowed to keep their guns.

If both sides would realize that
laws which guarantee the right of
a United States Citizen to own a
gun ll s/he passes a competency
test beneﬁt all, and ii liberals
would only slop looking at die
NRA as the root of all evil. kind oi
like the way Reagan views the
Soviet Union. some constructive
work might be able to get done.
