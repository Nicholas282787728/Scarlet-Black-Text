the frogs practice their swimming
lesson, the turtles float, the star—
fish out floating figures. the dog ’54:

water-snakes and water—bugs race
and play, the eels and seals take
their slenderizing exercises. the mer-
maids waltz and the dragon flies
hover on the surface on the water,
to form the nine parts of the gen
eral theme.

He then joins the diving lessons. As

side of the pond Peter sadly picks
up his wet clothes and turns towards
home.
