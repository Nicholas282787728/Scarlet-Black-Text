The longrawaited debut mini-1p by the
Kissing Cousins has linally been released
on the Z-Much label, The group includes
LuVonn Bogley on lead vocals, DeVerne
Bogley on drums and synthesizer, Earl
Slatton on synthesizers and accurdian,
Cornle DeWilde on bass and Hammond
Fun-Time organ, and Delbert Snodgrass
0n Ronco MagiKeys organ.

Kissing Cousins‘ qualiﬁcations are
many and varied. Slatton and DeVerne
Bogley both played with the nowdelunct'
Polish Cowboys, a popular Appanooose
County area band. Snodgrass was a
tormer studio musician with “The Floppy
Show.” LuVonn Bogley, though a
newcomer to the music scene, is no
stranger to Show business. She worked as a
gergo dancer lor several years under her
maiden name, LuVonn Lust, She has also
appeared in several men’s magazines,
most recently in the “My Woman. , . My
Wife" section of Gentleman's Companion,

Unfortunately, Kissing Cousins’ record
fails to Capture the excitement of their live
periormances For the uninformed, the
group is particularly noted tor their
bizarre attire, The [our men wear iowa

player Earl slatton, who provided the in-
spiration for the name of one of Elvis’
most famous films.

Kissing cousins:
Down-home new wave

iiawkcye sweat pants, hiprwaders, and
fluorescent orange hunting vests, topped
off by seed corn caps, As De Wilde describe
ed it in a recent interview, “We wanted to
look like Devo, but less gay.”

The main attraction, however, is
LuVonn Bogley. She designs and con
structs her own costumes out of such
diverse materials as aluminum foil, Saran
Wrap, and spare tractor parts.

Kissing Cousins' music is basic infec-
tious, hookrladen, synthopop, with in-
fluences ranging from Human League to
Dolly Parton to Ted Nugent. (Editor's note
“Oh My Godl”) Bogley put it best, “We
wanted to get into the intense sort of New
Wave scene, but we wanted something that
the regular lolks around here can get into,
too,” Harvest Time Session USA is sure to
be a hit on college radio because of its
diverse inﬂuences, its charismatic lead
singer, and solid New Wave sensibility.
The Kissing Cousins have really got the
beat}

ror, much in the style of Hitchcock's
suspense iilms. The story revolves around
the wile and mistress of a tyrannical
school headmaster whom they plot to
murder They appear to have carried out
their plan painstakingly and in lucid
detail, but the dead man proves m be less
dead than he ought to be! The frightening
and humorless revelation, together with
the surprise ending, has created a cult
following for the ﬁlm among fans of the
horror genre. The three prinCiples are
