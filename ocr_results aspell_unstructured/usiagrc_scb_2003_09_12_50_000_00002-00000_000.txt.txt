pubs owner, this change we made because
“the police told to that [college le1 are not

The dark lighting in the pub makes it
dimeult to distinguish a real Gnnnell Col-
lege ID from a fake one and the penalties
for serving alcohol to underage people are
high. “For the first offense you have to close
for 2 days. For the second you have to close
for a week," said Tanzosch “The bartender
is charged $1000 and the owner is charged
$1000."

At an open foium about the new campus center held
on Tuesday, [W0 :iicliltccts from Cesar Pulli & Associates,
Darin Cookand l>hilip Nelson, weie present to discuss the
design of ihe center, answei qucsllun: and listen to con»
come from faculty, stalinnd students. g

The forum lasted For two hours and a total of about
ten people. four students and six adults, came within those
two hours. Among the students win Eli zigas '00, one of
the student representatives on the campus center Advi:
sory Committee, a group composed of faculty, students
stats, and administration. The Committee's purpose is to
“advise the architects on decisions aliecting the design, de-
velopment, and planning of the Campus Centei," stid
Zigas

The new campus center is going to include, among
other things, a dining hall with a seating capacity ofubout
920 students. an email lounge, a larger post ofnee. emces
for the student Goveiiimeiit Association (SGA) and stue
dent Affairs, a multipurpose room to function as the south
Lounge and Forum Coffeehouse do now and space for
academic classes and student groups.

Major changes in dining are being planned on well.
The new dining hall will be replacing both cowles and
Quad and will {00mm various food stations including a
pizza bar, a vegan but, and a section serving burgers and
fries. A grille, designed to replace ihe Forum Grille, will be
located outside the dining lull and will be able to seat 110
to l20 people. The committee is also looking into allow.
ing students to use meal replacements and dining dollars
to purchase late night meals, much the way Fosprcss cur.
rently works.

According to Philip Nelson. the development of the
campus center has been going on for ten years now, which
means that all current sludcnrx missed the l ml design
process. The June 2004 start date for tonsrruction means
there it no time to enact mayor changes in the design.

Nonetheless, zigas encourages students to submit in.
piit on the cimpiis center to the Committee “the best way
to let one of tlie student icpresunmtivcs know wlut‘s on
your mind regarding the campuseenter is to email us with

card for a surfboard.

your quesiions or comments, siop us somewhere around
campus, or arrange a time to sit and schmooee about your
thoughts," hesaid. ”We iepiescntstudents betterwhen we
bear fiom them."

The committee has already received sortie comments
that students placed in the comment box in the Forum
North Lounge. This feedback suggests that a maionty of
students are opposed to the new center on aesthetic
grounds. Comments included: “it doesn‘t iii the rest of
campus." “it looks like a middle/high school," “its aim»
cious" and “it looks like a good place to bomb."

Comments from the opposite end ofthe spectrum in.
elude, “it is wonderful. thedininghall will beconvciiieiit,"
“I love it," “it looks and feels great in all ways thank you"
and “cool,"

Some students did take the time to give more detailed
and specific comments and criticism The biggest student
content is about a lack ofadetiuate paila'ngsince the can»
tcr is being built in the space now occupied by the Darby
parking lot. other students have voiced environmental
impactcoiiccrns and several have requestedspacc foradance
studio.

zigas himself is mostly concerned with environmental
aspeco, including a compost heap, having varied seating
in the dining hall, and incorporanngsomecomponenu of
Expicss into the new Grille.

Another inaior concern is the future of the phomgm-
pliyand ceramics workshops that are currently in the Darby
basement. ln order to stay within budget, those features
have been removed from the ﬁnal plans and several other
small details have been changed. As otright now, no space
is specifically set aside for the workshops, but Tom crady,
Vice President ofstudent services, is confident the prob.
lem ean be remedied. “we have room [tor theml." he said

Despite the einirism, the committee is conﬁdent that
the building will have a positive impact on the students
who will be using it. zigas feels that it has been “planned
exhaustively" with input from many different groups, which
leaves him “optimistic about its sueeess as a vibrant, well
used structure for all sorts ofactivirv on campus. “
