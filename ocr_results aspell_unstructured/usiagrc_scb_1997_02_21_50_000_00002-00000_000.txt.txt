Beats kicking back into my ear,
feeling the savory rhythm sift
through and just thinking how today
life is like a rhythm. Next week this
campus Will be treated to the intoxi-
cating sounds of a panorama of
rhythms, styles and instruments

As part ofthe GrinnellCollege Per-
cussion Symposium and the Iowa
Percussive Arts Society’s “Days of
Percussion," the campus will be
home to some of the world‘s best perz
cussionists. As Mark Dorr, president
ofPAS and Grinnell College percus-
sion instructor said, this is “one of
the largest festivals of its kind in the
United States."

The amazing lineup this year Cone
sists of funk master David Garibaldi
and his band the Talking Drums.
Leigh Howard Stevens, “the best
classical man'mbist ever,” according
to Time magazine, the Mat Britain/
Dan Moore duo who will provide an
interesting mix of steel pan and elece
tronic percussion, William F. Ludwig
.l r, who has expanded his fathers cre-
ation of the modern day drum set into
the world renown Ludwig industries,
and Bret Kuhn, the percussion head
of the world champion Cavaliers
Drum and Bugle Corps,

Senior Seth Hosler expressed his
amazement at the number of great
percussionisis coming to Grinnell.
He simply states, “Incredible. It‘s
more than one could ever expect." As
the excitement buzz‘s in Hosler’s
eyes he adds that it's going to, be
“great to be able to meet these fae
mous people, there are just so many
chances to see great music." Dorr
seconded Hosier’s belief, saying next
week is a chance to see and hear an
“outstanding lineup of intemntion-
ally renown artists."

Two years ago the college held a
similar percussion symposium with
world renown percussionists Bobby
Sanabria and Poncho Sanchez. Se-
nior Mike Campbell described how
it was “amazing to see the level of

these artists." However, according
to Dorr, this year's symposium will
be bigger and better than the last one.
He estimates the attendance for the
two days of non-stop beats and
rhythm to be between five hundred
and seven hundred. Those in attenz
dance will be fed a dose of what Dorr
describes as a “combination of aca-
demics and performing."

The symposium will not only be a
eroll through the world of perforv
mance, but will also be highlighted
by a number of lectures and clinics,

“[It is] one ofthe
largest festivals
of its kind in the
United States. It

will be cool,”

"Mark Dori,
Percussion Instructor

He explains how the artists who are
coming are “educators, performers
and academic lecturers at same
time." Leigh Howard Stevens has
authored a book called Method of
Movement, which is the established
book on modern day marimba tech-
nique. Both David Garibaldi and
William F. Ludwig .lr. have published
highly acclaimed books on drums
mtng. The artists are also educators
as they have taught at places like
Stanford University, the University
of California at Berkeley and other
esteemed colleges. This academic
and lecture experience will be fully
taken advantage of at the two day
symposium.

A number of lectures have been
scheduled on topics ranging from the
“History of Drums & Drumming in
America” to the ”History of Steel
Pan Drumming in the Caribbean."
Dorr considers the symposium an

opportunity to explore the cultural
and historical context of the music
whlcli will be performed. From
clmmlning as an importantsignol in
the revolutionary and civil wars to
drumming in its relation to the de
velopment of Caribbean culture, the
lectures are jam packed with learn
ing experience for everyone.

In addition to lecturing, the pore
formers will also be teaching Cllltr
ics. Sophomore Hudson Ludvigson
sees the various clinics as providing
a “wide range of flavors." He sees
the clinics the professionals are put»
ting on as “givmg [students] a breath
of fresh air and giving them inspira-
tion Younger kids are inspired by
watching [the professionals play],"
Ludvigson concludes. Hosler cone
curred, saying that you “learn so
much more from watching than from
books.” Ultimately Dorr hopes that
by “bringing artists of this stature
who interact directly with students”
that they will ”serve as role models"
for the students.

However, it will not only be the
professionals who Will be perform»
ing, as students from colleges and
high schools around the state will
take center stage at one of the three
venues (Harris Center, PEC. Fine
Arts). As Hosler says, it puts “siu»
dents in contact with amazing drum-
ming at every level.” Mike Campbell
added that he is excited for the
Grinnell College Percussion
Ensemble‘s performance, which will
be on Thursday. “It will be cool," he
says. “One of the pieces we will be
doing was recently composed and it
should be interesting," he says.

Regardless oflevel of skill, all of
the artists who attend the percussion
symposium are students of rhythm.
However, Don emphasizes that “You
don't have to be an expert to enjoy
it." He remarks that rhythm is some-
thing which is in all of us and we all
feel. Taste the beats that make us
move on Thursday, February 27th
and Friday, February 28th and then
sit back and feel the groove.

 

The Percussion Symposium:
, Meet the performers

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

David Garibaldi has been called
“one of the most inﬂuential drume
mers of his generation." He is per-
haps best known as the innovator of
funk drumming, which he developed
as dmmmer with the group Tower of
Power in the 1970’s. In his years
with Tower of Power they recorded
eleven albums, including two gold
records. 'He has been placed on
Modern Drummer’s Magazine honor
roll, recognizing him for his lasting
contributions to percussion. Indeed,
most of the student percussionists I
talked with were extremely excited
about seeing a drummer as influenr
tial as Garibaldi. His inﬂuence spans
across styles as he has worked with
artists such as Natalie Cole, 1302
Scaggs, Jermaine Jackson and Gino
Vannelli. Currently, he is part of a
band called the Talking Drums which
attempts to mix the “exotic potion"
of AfroAcubztn, Brasilian and Funk
rhythms into a beat that applies “folk—
lonc rhythms to the drumset." The
Talking Drums, who wrll play Fri-
day, February 28th at the Harris Cenr
ter, also consist ofrenowtied percuse
Sionists Michael Spiro and Jesus
Diaz. Spiro, who is versed in the
Latin music genre, has produced nu-
merous albums, including his new-
est, BataeKetu which is receiving in
ternational acclaim, He has played
with a diverse selection ofmusicians
who include Carlos Santana, Bobby
McFerrin, David Byrne, Grace Slick
and Ella Fitzgerald, DiaZ who be-
gan by playing on wooden boxes in
his homeland ofCuba has blossomed
into one of the best Latin percussion-
ists on the west coast.

The other highlighted event is the
performance by Leigh Howard
Stevens, who is one ofthe best, ifnot
the best marimbist of all lime. His

music ranges from the classical mu-
sic of 1.8. Bach to contemporary
works written for him within the last
couple ofmonths. Dorr talks of how
Stevens redeﬁnes the way people
think of the marimba. Until Stevens
developed the four mallet technique
much of music literature was seen as
impossible for a marimbist to play.
Stevens is able to now take a piece
of 1.5. Bach and transpose into the
language ofthe manmba. Not only
does he develop new ways of think
ing of the marimba, but has ulti-
mately opened up a whole new area
ofmusic. Stevens has received critiz
cal acclaim all over the world and has
been featured by Time magazine, and
various national radio broadcasts.
Perhaps his largest show was when
he introduced the marimba to China
in a televtsion performance that was
estimated to reach approximately
800 million viewers.

One of the key lecturers is William
F. Ludwig Jr. His career as a drum-
mer and historian has spanned over
half ofa century, His father was the
creator of the modern drum set, and
LudWig expanded his father’s crer
ation into Ludwig industries, the
“leadin g authority in the manufactur-
ing of all types of percussion instru-
ments." He is also well known for
authoring a book in 1940 calledr
“Modern Dance Drumming," which
is widely used in teaching circles to-
day.

Bret Kuhn has won two world
championships and three high per-
cussion awards as part of percussion
staff and caption head in the Cavar
liers Drum and Bugle Corps. In atle
dition, he has been an active drumset
artist as he has performed with
Bobby Show, NEXUS and Gloria
Estefan.

Mat Britain currently is a percus-
sionist with Grammy Award winning
country artist Lee Greenwood. He

has performed at such prestigious
events as the Panorama Festival with
the Amoco Renegades Steel Band,

Dan Moore is an assistant profese
sor ofmusic at the University oflowa
and since the age ofthirteen has been
composing and performing music for
percussion. His new approach to the
Marimba uses a MIDI setup which
allows for “electronically triggered
sounds to blend with the natural
acoustic sound of the marimba. To—
gether the Britain/Moore duo have
pushed Bob Becker of Nexus to re-
mark that, “If this group were a sports
car, they'd be a Porsche."

Ultimately, writing about these
great artists doesn‘t do themjustice,
so attend their performances, As stu»
dent Hudson Ludvigsoli said, “It‘s
free. You've got nothing to lose and
a lot to gain.“

The percussion symposium begins
on Thursday with events scheduled
throughout thefotlowing week,

Amadeus

Milos Fomian's brilliant, Oscar
winning adaptation ofPeter Shaffer's
hit play, Amadeus, is a fictionalized
retelling of the final days ofAntonio
Salieri. Salieri (F. Murray Abraham,
who won the Best Actor Oscar for
his portrayal), a famous composer
for the emperor tn Mozart‘s day but
now incarcerated in an insane asyr
lum, begins his final confession to a
young cleric. He tells the story of his
relationship with Mozart (Tom
Hulce), in a 30zyear ﬂashback to
when he ﬁrst met the Zﬁrycarpltl
prodigy. Furious that this boor can
produce such beautiful music, Salieri
determines to keep Mozart's talent
from continued recognition

After Mozart manages to get the
Emperor’s ear, his career is launched,
and we see him writing and conduct-
ing several of his best pieces. Then
his friends, health, and resources
waste away, He works most fever-
ishly_on his “Requiem," commis—
sioned by a masked stranger. The
effort proves the final stroke against
the greater composer’s wcakened
constitution, and he is buried in a
pauper's grave. Milos Forman’s die
rcclion is flawless, Neville

Marnner's musical direction is sue
perb, and the film is a feast for the
eyes and ears. Although Fonnan con-
centrates on Mozart’s more popular
works, the prodigious output of
Mozart‘s short life is clearly con—
veyed. Amadeus is a must for any,

“Delicatessen” is

is typical of the Broadway musical-
turned ﬁlm, there is an adequate and
even prodigious degree of corniness
that I may warn you of. Regarding
the quality of the movie, however. I
can say but one thing: if Rogers and
Hammerstein would have composed
just one more blockbuster, this would
be it. Cabaret was adislurbing por-
trayal of the influence of the devil
himself over 1930‘s Europe, and
Delicatessen is the responseia
powerful, poignant tale ofangst, an-
ger, and assonance culminating in
one well-deserved “You know where
to shove it.” Director Mel Gibson
does an outstandingjob of doing the
seemingly impossible—altering this
stage production (with SO many
techniques that are better live) to cre~
ate a decent film which embodies it
beautifully. The casting was remark-
able; onc of the better things about
the movie was the reduction of the
star factor down to two beautiful
women. Fran Drescer's cameo was
without doubt the funniest moment
in the film, unfortunately Madonna
received a large but disappointingly
silent role. (After her knockout per-
formance as Argentina‘s precious
one, I think she deserves better.)
