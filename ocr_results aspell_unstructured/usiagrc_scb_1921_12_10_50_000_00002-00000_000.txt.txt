A VISI" 0]} BUSINESS 'l'llll‘l

With the approach of Christmas and
all the excitement of going home for
the holidays, it is well that we may
consider the opinion of Gl’innell which
our friends will get after they have
welcomed us home and begin to wondr

why he went to Gl'lnnell. One of our
professors said, “Show that you are a.
college student, and Show that you are
from Grinhell.” This professor fur-

ther suites that real Grinnell people
are not only men and women, but they
they are also ladies and gentlemen.

ple snow that they are ladies and

boys and girls any longer, but are
looking at them witha more critical
eye, and are judging them as college
men and women. They are wondering
not only what the college is doing for
the present generation, but they are
also wondering what it is doing to the
present generation. There is a great
question in the minds' of many of these
folks at home who are watching us
'so closely as to the value of a college
education.

it would he a good thing for us to
sit down and think over again, peiu

naps for the ﬁrst time for many, why
we are here. As an aid to this pro-
cess of self analy sis it might be well to
try to enumerate some of things which
we- have learned and also the things
which we have failed to learn in our
stay in Gl'innell. It would be a means
of determining whether this has been

What Do You Think?

In the last issue of the s & B a
certain enthusiastic "Quadite" waxed
lather sarcastic at the expense of
those who do not dance. The writer,
who dances, feels that the “"Quadlie”
had the wrong spirit altogether. She
recognized no viewpoint? but attempt-
ed hy her own sarcastic remarks to
quench the nondancer.

We must remember that the “Rec
Iloul'” is a new institution at Grinnell
and that there is still a group of stu—
dents uho do not douceialld who may
have better reasons for not dancing
than many of us have [or dancing.

The “Rec Hour" was originally
planned to include entertainment (or
those who do not dance as well as for
those who do dance and we believe
that such an entertainment should
he provided and should be in progress
at the same time as the dancing. It
would do no harm to try this scheme
and it might prove the solution to the
problem.

The writer is not sure that there is
a sulticiently large group of the non»
dancers to Will‘l'zmt such a program—
that must be left for the Recreation
committee to decide—but if there is

against Germany, and in the late
lJapan came to her aid against Cot»

this conference met.

The proposed Four Power Treaty,
which is to take its place, does not
require that an‘y one ofl the four na-
tions should come to the aid or one or
two or all or the others in case of war,
;n contingency which seems wholly out
or the question in the immediate fu—
;ture as there are no other nations
which have impurmnt interests in the
far east, except little Holland, which
is perfectly content to be left seen
by the big nations in her possession
’or her Dutch Indies. The sense of the
,ncw treaty is “as you are.” All iour
Wowel‘s agree as tar as the Paciﬁc
ocean is concerned not to covet their
neighbors property and to guarantee
one anothcr security in their present
territorial dispositions. We are to be
guaranteed by mutual agreement in
our posiuon in the Philippines and
Guam, Japan in her possession or Poi-ti
Arthur, and the British or Hongkoug.
Thus the plan is to put an end to
worry, suspecion and intrigue, which
nourish international enmity. Canada

as neighbours on this basis for ovcr
la hundred years.
