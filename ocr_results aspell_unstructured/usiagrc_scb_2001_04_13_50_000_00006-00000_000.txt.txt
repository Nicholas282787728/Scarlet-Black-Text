Columnists

it you were referred by lricob's KDIC news show
on Wednesday evening, thank you tor j ' 'ng us For
this edition. (Thanks for the props, JcDogJ oh yeah,
and check out his scene too.

Godspell

Skye: This weekend, support your fellow
Grinncllians. Go and sec the student production of
the musical Godspell. people, Rise up. Take pride in
the talent that surrounds you. I know it surrounds
me every time Nick Malinowski walks by me in the
dining hall with his supctctall ice cream cont. (Oh
yeah, Nick rind his melodic voice are in it, too.) It
shows Friday, ssturday and sundry at 7 pin. in the
Harris Center Concert Hall. Tickets are available at
th: Forum Desk (for free. [ believe).

Dallas: Did you so: Mac; r/rr Pamm and wonder
why everyone was laughing when Ben stiller gave the
really awkward prayer at the dinner (3121:? stop by
Harris and the gaps in yonrculturul education will all
be rilled in with the song “Day by Day." one nega.
tive: the song is guaranteed to get stuck in your head
For wccks.

Skye: By the way, it really amuses us that the stu
dent group, Grinncllians in Musical- Productions,
spells “gimp." An ndded bonus.

Collegium Musicum

Dallas: The performances or the collegium
Musicum are one derinite way to expand your musi.
eai knowledge. ltyou listen to classical music, you
might possibly have heard or Frescobaldi or
Monteverdi, but you probably wouldn't be able to hum
a rune from one orthese composers. Sunday, the 15‘”,
at 7:30 in Sebring Lewis Hall the group will present a
program entitled From More to South: Marie from
Burgundy ant/1mm Cor/er, Show up to hear works
from even lesser known, but still great. early compose
crs, and orcoursc the odd assortment orearly instru-
ments is always interesting.

Skye: l agree. i would recommend seeing the per.
rormance just to see the dirrerent insrrurnenrs from
early Renaissance times (Dallas inrormed rue that this
is the period or which we speak). Dude, last time I
went someone played a crank box-type thingy that’s
called a hurdy-gurdy! What a craay name. l waited
the whole time for the Jack in the box to pop up, but
he never did. Awww. . I must eaurron you, though:
the music is any evenctempered and lulling_as in,
ya mighrwant to veto it ifyou were partyin' hard the
night before (don’t worry, Dallas’s shoulder made a
nice pillow).

thotography Exhibit

Skye: I’ll say it to anyone: I. love photography it
you’re like me, you would warrr to check our the work
or our very own sarah Jackson and Megan Husrings
at the Forum's Terrace Art Gallery sometime between
right now and tomorrow—dunng normal Forum
hours, natch. (Which means naturally. I’ve learned
that no one says that here. it's just me. Don't ssk me
why. I think it sounds swingin'.) Hcavcns, I’m so tan-
gential. Dallas?

Dallas: Ah yes, the wonders orslang. lcan’r think
oranything to say about the photography exhibit be-
cause I, as of now, have not seen it, So I think I'll
resort to cave man ‘slangr Picture, good....peopic
not see. bad. \

Mama Cass and the Different

Dallas: i know very little about Mama Cass. Fact
1: singer in the Mamas and the Papas, who will be
forever California Dreamin‘ in my mind. Fact 2: she
died choking on some sort of sandwich, ham I've
heard. All the more reason to attend the lecture by
Professor Hugh Stevens today at 4:15 in ARH [02,
Apparently the talk will center around the ﬁlm Berra.
zi‘ﬁrl Thingwhlch will be shown in ARI—I 302 tonight
and tomorrow night at 3:00, and Sunday at 2:00.

Skyc: You’re so goofy, Too bad that's about how
much I know about her, too. Although I did rcad that
her real name was Cass Elliot. Professor Stevcns is also
expected to discuss how Mama cass and by exten-
sion, American culture, ﬁgures into—get this—Brit-
ish gay and black culture. He will touch on the Film
My Emurtﬁilbzundrrnt (this is a very beautiful lecc
ture) and the author Salman Rushdie. A rich amal-
gam (I like that word) of media inﬂuences on culture,
As Dallas's dad always says, “Life’s a garden, Dig it."

A Righteous Babe

Everyone agrees that Ani
Difranco’s new double

album IS a great listen
by Sarah Aswell
Arts Editor

i listened to Ani before she was popular, I listened
to her when she was popular, I listened to her after
she had “sold out” and gotten a husband. a band and
wheelbarrow: full of money. I have bought and cn-
ioyed all 8 million of her albums. lam a very bad,
biased person to have ieviewing hcr new double ale
biiin “Reveling/Rcekoning.“ sure. i might be :tblc to
compare it to other albums and give you background
information on the ariist, but I certainly won't try to
point out the albunrs' problems or make any sort of
objective statements.

To balance out this review and to possibly make it
helprul to the readers, 1 havcrskcd the help CfNICIIOV
ins Johnson, Nicholas is n sports editor, physics inn-
joi. and a male. Nicholas, like most malesports editor
physics inaiors, thinks that Ani is sort of angry and
the reason he has so much trouble with the ladies. If
you don‘t know much about Ani and want to really
know what the music is likc, he is sure to give a
scaldingly honesrrcvieworrlrc discs. It, however, you
already think that Ani rocks and ,ust want to hear
how much I think the albums and Ani rock, Just keep
reading.

Aiii released het8 millionth studio album effort on
April 10'”. “Reveling/Reckoning" is a two-disc set that
serves as a sort Dleng-Yang setting forAni's musieal
styles. One disc is the cnclgctic, loud, badass side of
Ani, while the other shows the contemplative, politi-
cal, folk artist side.

“Reveling” is the upbeat album that reariircs a full
band as well as motley crew of featured artists. it is
high-energy and can be compared to 1998's Little Plat-
ri'c Cart/c and 2000’s T0 the 72:». Expect to rock out
to most orrhese songs, especially “Al n’t Thar thewsiy,"
“Marrow." and “What How when Where (Why
Who)." Like Difranco's last album, thcsc songs are
very layered with a variety of instruments, samples,
and sound clips, ranging from brass section jams to
personal answering machine messages.

In “Reckoning." Diftanco returns [0 the basics with
a disc rull orslower girl-and-hercguimr songs thar are
reminiscent other much earlier albums from the early
‘90s. Stand-outs include “You're Next Bold Move"
“Grey" and “So What.”

What makes these albums different than past a1-
bums is the short instrumentals scatter throughout
the albums. Thcsc Sl\o[[(
songs and add a groovy
that has only to date b
presentwhen Dirianeo p
forms live, Also, the she
number orsongs (there a
26 tracks on the discs ar
roughly two hours ormus
on thcdiscs makes irposs
for Ani to showcase her
range of instrumental and voeal ralenrs and stylings.
And having two albums with separate, alnnost alto-
gether different, genres of music makes it possible to
have variety without losing cohesiveness.

In conclusion, Arii rocks and so does her new double
album. If it is a beautiful Friday afternoon and you
just ﬁnished classes, you can listen to “Revellng.” If
you just broke up with yoursignii‘icant other and it is
raining, try out “Reckoning." its music for your
moods, and you will not be disappointed. Right,
Nicholas? Right.>

When Samh announced at lastTuesday’s 5&8 story
meeting that she had received the ncw Ani Dianco
double album, chlling/Rirhmirzg. in the mail to re.
view, i knew she would start getting all giddy

Many on the 5&1? staff, Sarah included, can call
themselves bigAni fans. They are the people who core
reel me when l try to pronounce her name “Annie"
nthcr than ‘ZAaaaaahhhhhrnccﬂ’ I knew Sarah’s review
orthe discs would be peppered with words like “go.
nius" and “really fmakin’ good." I also know I had to
do something about it, so I offered to also review the
album as a counterpoint.

Renting/Reckoning by Ani Difranco

I have never been much oran Am ran. She has ale
ways been the ringleader orrhe “Angry Women Mu-
siciens," a group I define as women singer/songwriters
who hare me because I am male and who could prob.
ably beat me up in gave them any gutrabour ir. Be-
cause ormy tearorher. l put the first orrhe two cos,
Rem/ling, into the CD player :xpccting the worst.

I wss pleasantly surprised. The girl.and.her.guirsr
sound i had come to expect from DiFrancu was rarely
found on Riuelling. Replacing it is a good blend or
“Ani-alonc-with-her—guitar" songs, [‘Aniaplaylngrlots»
of-instruments" songs and ‘nniandhereroadband.
doing-studioorecordings“ songs.

The rirsr two tracks on the disc, “Ain’t that the Way"
and “O.K." are two or the best. “Way." a collabora—
tion between DiFranco and her road band, is well.
layered with some great trumpet interludes, Ant puts
down her guitar in “OK." long enough to do an ad-
mirable job playing the drums and key bass.

Drrraneo turns in another strong perrormnnee on
“Heartbreak Even.” At only 3:36, it has an almost
poppy reel ro it that some Ani fans may resent, but
Dirraneo's brearhy voesls give the song a great sense
oiemotion.

“What How When thtc (Why Who)" is prob.
ably the best track on the rirst dise. Maceo Parker
makes an appesranee with a

great saxophone solo on a
song originally conceived as
one where the whole band
would be singing the inter
rogatives that start each.
The second CD or the double album, Reckoning,

was much harder to get into than the ﬁrst. thrcas

. Reyei/ingiras DiFranco exploring a number ofdiffcn

enr sounds, leer/toning is much more rooted in a slow
somber mood.

Rec/toning is the lyrically stronger orrhe two em,
but it is also the more jaded. “Your Next Bold Move"
laments the rail orsociety under the Reagan and Bush
administrations, while “So What" revives the “I hate
love" theme I've come to expect trom DiFranco. isup.
pose both the sound and the words on this disc will
appeal to tans with the neeessary angst to relate to
them. Me, I was just hummingshowrunes by the end
orrraek two.

As much as it pains me to admit it, Revel/mg/Rrr/r.
oningis a good album. Ani runs will love it because it’s
Ani and musicianswiil like itbecause (again, as much
as this pains me to admit) DiFtanco is a topmotcl‘i
singer and songwriter.

Personally, I could listen to at least the first halter
the album ormy own volition. It would iusrbealone,
in my room, with my door shut and locked. Afterall,
someone around here still has to vote for Blues Trav—
