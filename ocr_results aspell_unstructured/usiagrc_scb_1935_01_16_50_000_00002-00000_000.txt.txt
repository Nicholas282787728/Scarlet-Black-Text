WHICH SPOON NEXT?

Knox has its losing football team, the Uni-
veristy of California at Los Angeles has its “reds,"
Oxford has its vote against bearing arms, and
Cvrixmell—Crrinnell has its freshmen dinner dates
for the development of the finer points of eti-
quctte,

Nothing else Grinnell has done in recent
years has gained such wide comment. Inaugura-
tion of the custom received notice in the New
York Times, the Stanford Daily, the Oberlin Rev
view and numerous other papers throughout the
country. ‘

Says the Stanford paper: “Freshmen at
Grinnell college had to take a lesson in social
finesse this fall. They were required to appear
at dinner with dates, the upperclassmen were
placed in charge of the meal with orders to bear
down on the table manners of the first year men."

If the idea is really as worthwhile as the wide
notice given it would imply, an occasional repeti—
tion of “date dinners” during the year might be
worth considering. Perhaps even the upperclass-
men might profit by an occasional affair of this
sort. Since Grinnell has gained a name as a
school which places emphasis upon the social nicee
ties, it might not be a bad idea to earnestly strive
to deserve it.

COMMUNISTS 0R STUDENTS?

William Randolph Hearst of newspaper fame
recently launched in his papers and over the radio
the latest phase of his “red"-hunt. He is using
his widespread inﬂuence in an effort to discredit
and oust numerous liberal-minded and free think-
ing teachers in the universities and colleges of
this country. While privately-owned schools may
be less subject to the results of his propaganda
than the great public universities, it would be
well to remember that once this pernicious idea
takes a hold on American minds and is applied
successfully to some of the public institutions, its
influence will quickly spread and endanger pri«
vate institutions

Aside from being an attempt to boost circula-
tion, Mr. Hearst’s stunt constitutes a menace to
free speech and free thought. In his Syracuse
“Journal," he accused certain Syracuse university

professors of communistic tendencies. This news<
paper presented garbled accounts of interviews
with these professors with the intent of showing
them to be Communists engaged in spreading
communistic doctrines. Needless to say, these
accusations proved largely false. But they have
done their mischief of stirring up the public
mind.

It is essential that an educational institution
be free from censorship of any kind. Education
as a means to enlightenment should not be limited
to certain kinds of enlightenment, others being
forbidden. Censorship is incompatible with the
scholar's search for truth. Free discussion and
tree thought should not be hedged in by any for-
hidden bogey. Indeed the best means of dis-
crediting communism is to expose it to critical
eyes and subject it to close examination, for then
its fallacies will be disclosed

Mr, Hearst has endeavored in his accusations
to interpret the scholastic interest in communism
which at present is held by many persons, not only
in our colleges and universities but in the world
at large as well, as an active campaign for the sun-
port and spread of communism. But neither Inc
nor any one else has the right to demand sup—
pression of the privilege of legitimate scholastic
interest so long as it remains such, American
colleges and universities should be zealous in
their defense of this privilege, and of free speech
and free thought as they are associated with it.

BALANCING THE HOOKS
(Brown Daily Herald)

Figures compiled recently by a leading New York
insurance company in answer to the question. “Does
College Pay?" show that the average high school gradu.
ate goes to work when he is eighteen years old, reaches
his maximum earning power of $2,300 annually when he
is fifty and during his entire life earns approximately
$33,000.

The college graduate. on the other hand, does not
go lo work until he is twenty.two but reaches a maxi.
mum of $5,500 per year at the age of sixty. His total
life earnings will be $180,000. $92,000 more than the high
school graduate receives.

The question might be raised, “Is this increased earn.
ing power the result of college training, or is it the result
of superior inafe ability found in the man who, incidently,
happens to go to college?" .

To the person who prefers the second alternative, one
might say that the value of a college education cannot
be measured in terms of money. that it is the intellectual
and cultural cultivation which makes college valuable.
The whole question might well be resolved into a con.
siderafion of the fundamental aim of a college education.
Do we seek higher learning to fill our pocketboolu or

WHY THE BAND PLAYED
(Daily Knnsun)

They stmck up the band in Mosbach, Germsny, re.
cently. In fact, they struck up three of them, and the
whole town turned out to help chrislen the twenty-filth
child of Herr and rrau Adam Schrnaetz. They called
out the fire department, too. so that the youngest cilizen
might have his just share of godlaihers.

It was a gala day for Mosbacb and the Schmaetz
family. and all twenty—seven members of the latter were,
no doubt, up bright and early that morning. The little
"guest of honor" had probably kept father and mother
up most of the night, anyway, and its brothers and sisters
surely must have been glad to get up and stretch their
cramped bodies. We should think so, at least, if they
all slept in two beds—and that is all the beds Herr
Schmaetz has been able to provide for his little brood.

Something leads us to believe that there wasn't a
great deal of tarrying over breakfast, either. But that
would not matter so much, since the excitement over the
anticipated ceremony would tend to make them forget
that there really was very little breakfast over which to
tarry.

Nor did the Sehmaetz girls have any trouble deciding
which dresses to wear. They probably had them all on.
But who would worry about clothing, when little brother,
or sister perhaps, was about to play the leading role in
the most famous event in the history of the village?

Then, when the christening ceremony was over, we
wonder if the citizens of Moshach, who are contributing
to the support of the Schmaetz family, wished them many
happy returns of the day?

human?” by T. Swunn Harding.

One of the most ridiculous aspects
of modern civilization is the detach.
merit from human values which science
has always studiously maintained. Mr.
Harding points out in this stimulating
article that the scientist possesses a
technique which, could he be per.
suaded to employ it, would complete.
ly renovate our so_called socisd sys.
tom. The author, a scientist himself.
predicts that unless the scientific
method is whole—heartedly employed
by trained scientisu in evolving a new
social order, even the gains of techni.

prepared to assimilate them. In the

Numeroul Interelting Facts
Learned by Search
Through File-

As The Scarlet and Black has for
some time boasted to be “The First
College Newspaper West 01 the Miss.
issippi," it was with some skepticism
that a staff msnbcr read a similar
claim In the pages of an exchange
paper from Yankton college, Ymkton,
So. Dak, recently. The northern pa-
per was celebrating its fiftieth annl.
versary.

A search through the files of The
Scarlet and Black failed to definitely
solve the argument, but did bring
quite an amount of interesting history
to light.

Pint Published in 1564

It was learned that the ﬁrst Grin-
nell college news publication made is
appearance 62 years ago, which, inso.
far as it was the predecessor of The
Scarlet and Black. upholds this pa.
per's claim. 0n the other hand, the
present name of the paper was first
introduced in 18!“, making the pre.
sent school year the Inrtieth that The
Scarlet and Black, under that title,
has been published.

The files revealed that the first
Grinnell college news publication was
established Aug. 2.3.1871, under the
title, “Iowa College News letter." It
appeared as a feature of the Grinnell
Herald, taking up about two columns
oﬁ space. Bit-president r. H. Magoun
was the real editor of the publication,
though his name did not appear in
the section, and irulead of current
news the News Letter contained dis-
cussinns on theology, science and phil.
osophy.

Becomes student Publication

In June 1313 the students obtained
permission to print the News better
as an independent publication, sub.
ject to faculty censorship. This was
the seal forerunner of The Scarlet and
Black. ’

A News Letter association was form.
ed, made up of the members of the
four literary societies which existed
at that time. A board of directors
was also formed, but for lack of duties
to perform (it even happened in those
days) it soon passed out of existence.

News Letter Issued Monthly

The News letter was isued for
seven years, “monthly during the col.
lege year." During the celebration of
the college's twenty-fifth anniversary
it was published daily for one week.
For the year 1382.83 it appeared
“every third Saturday," but on the
following year again became a month.

Agitation for the establishment of
another paper. which had been pre.
valent on the campus for a number of
years, was climaxed in 1898 by the
formation of n new publication. s
"fortnightly," called “The Pulse.” It
was felt that the four literary societies
formed an ”organization too unwieldy
to handle the publication of a paper
efficiently."
Weekly rspcr in 1399

Beginning with September 1389 the
college had the benefit of a weekly
newspaper, as The Pulse and the News
Letter appeured bi.weekly, alternating
Saturdays.

Financial difficulties soon threat.
ened the existence of both publications
and they were forced to combine in
1390 and appeared under the title of
“The Unit," This paper was issued
every two weeks and ruled alone for
four years, until, in 1394, a group of
students conceived the idea of pub.
lishing a seml.weekly. Out of this
movement grew The Scarlet and
Black, which was introduced on the
campus on Sept. 12 of that school year.

Financed Jointly

For n year the two were issued con.

mmporaneously, but the same diffi.
culties encountered by The Pulse and
the News Letter forced consolidation of
The Unit and The Scarlet and Black
in 1895. For the following five years
the same publication board controlled
and financed both ioumals, but The
Unit was made a purely literary maga—
zine, while The scarlet and Black
continued to serve as the college news.

Among the notables who have head.
