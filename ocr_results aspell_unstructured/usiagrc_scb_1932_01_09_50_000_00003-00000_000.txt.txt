Campus Opinion .

What do you think of the iuliiig
that men and women may not dance
in cottage parlors during hours open
to visitors?

stuart Mille‘ I don’t think it's
such a good idea. All any one does
is sit around anyway. ,

Frances Rae: It seems to me to
be rather a pointless rule. Just what
is’the explanation?

Clyde wledeman: I can see no ob-
jection to the men and women danc-
ing together as long as the parlors
are open mainly for social calls.

Helen Lariabee: The older genera-
tion says we can't talk intelligently
on any subject so we might as well
Spend our time dancing.

John Shephardr Why not dance?

Grace Stnick- Roll up the rug:

‘ start the music; and let's dance:

Atstin Candi-ii 1 We dance at open
houses; we dance at varsitics; we
dance at house partic ~ we dance at
formals—so why not dance in the
cottage parlors, '

Marian Fredrickeon: I can see no
logical reason for not allowing the‘
men and women to dance together in
the parlors, Just why was the rule
made?

George Guyan: What is there to
do if we don't dancestaik about our
studies? -
