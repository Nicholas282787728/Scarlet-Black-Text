OSSY RENARDY

It is with great interest and enjoyment that
most of the students have been attending
the concert sc 3 this year. The negro choir
under the direction of Eva Jessye aroused
mucll favorable comment. Tomorrow night
we are fortunate enough to have another
very outstanding artist on the campus, one
who will be enjoyed by all music lovers.

Ossy Renardy, the unassuming 16ry081¥
01d Viennese violinist who took New York
by storm last January, will give a concert
ill Herrick Chapel. Ossy is, aside from be-
illg it musician, a human being with all the
enthusiasms and interests of his age. Be-
cause of danger to his hands, however, his
love of most major sports is confined to
rabid cheering ill the grandstands. He is
an admirable swimmer and an avid cyclist.
it is with the bicycle that he does most of
his exploring of the new places he is con-
ltinually visiting. '

Since he was 13, he has led a more or
less gypsy existence; and though he was
tutored ill academic subjects, his travelling
encouraged a great love for geography and
history. His stamp collection would make
any serious stamp collector blink with envy
and these stamps alld picture postcards he
has collected on his travels lelp him to re-
member the countries and c' es.

As soon as he is done with his four to
six hours of musical study and violin prac‘
tice, Rellardy indulges ill some of his many
illtercstsichcss, ping-pong, sightseeing, or
reading. He is also learning English which
may be classiicd as interesting or other-
wise, according to a person’s views on the
subject.

Ptcllardy has woli the applause of the
music world and has received much wondelu
ful praise, but the tribute which is perhaps
the most characteristic proof of his prow-
ess is the compliment paid him by the
chairman of the woman’s club before Whom
he had played,

“It was the first time,” she said, “that
every one of the women ill the audience was

- silent at the same time for any period of
time.”

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

WE, T00, ARE WRITING HISTORY

So much has been written by now on the
subject of the Nazi persecution of Ger-
many’s Jewish population that almost notll»
illg' is left to add, Lille all other emotions,
indignation may wear thin, and we may
well have reached the time when accounts
of further anti-Jewish activities will leave
us as unmoved as does a list of the dead at
the Battle of Antietam, Perhaps this is just
as well; hate is not zl healthful emotion.

But as we read today's newspaper, let us
remember. We are contemporary with one
of the great examples of moss persecution
ill the history of the world Some of these
examples history has mercifully forgotten;
but today ill Germany and ill Spain our age
is writing the latest chapter to the book
which has somewhere near its beginning the
Pharaoh who demanded that his laborers
make bricks without straw, later the no
malls who watched the Christians ill the
arena, still later the Catherine who instir
gated the massacre on the eve of St. Bartho-
lomew, ill the next century Louis who re-
voked the Edict of Nantes.

Our time, too, is writing history, and in
spite of all our machines, all our mass edu—
cation, all our love of progress, all our
democracy, it becomes increasingly clear
posterity is likely to read about lls with the
same shudder of horror and incomprehen»
sioll with which we now read about the
Spanish lnquistion or Leopold‘s exploitation
of the Belgian Congo.

ONE HOUR 0F DELIGHT

One of the most gratifying things that has
happened on this campus for a long time is
the remarkable way our band has been re—
vived by Robert S. Vague): Grillnell stu-
dents who remember the plight of their
band during the last few years cannot help
but marvel at the remarkable change that
has taken place in that organization.

The campus has been getting more and
more baudconscious since the day of the
homecoming football game with Washburll,
when, for the first time in several years,
we realized that at last we had a band that
this college could be proud of. insofar as it
is possible to credit this change to one man,
the honor of having made our band over
belongs to its new director, Mr. Vagner.

The work of getting the band back to its
proper place in campus affairs is indeed
well begun, btlt by no means over. One step
in this task is the band concert to be hcld
in. Herrick chapel Fi'l'lilty night. This con-
cert deserves the wholchem-ted support of
the student body, not only as a tribute to
the splendid progress the band is making,
but for its own mice as u must *cltjayublc
way of spending an hour's time. The regular
Friday night open houses are being delayed
in order to give everyone a chance to attend
the concert,

Perhaps there are a few students on the
campus who have not yet realized how the
band has improved. The traditional campus
opillioll of “The band? Frankly, it stinks!”
is pretty well rooted, and not entirely with-
out reason, But if you haven’t heard the
band for a while, why not take an hour off
to attend the concert Friday at 7:30 pm?
You will be surprised and delighted with
the change,

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“Far too many scientists are ridiculous bea
cause they write longrwinded articles about
their researches alld fail to put them into
proper literary style.” Centenaly college’s
young E. J. Fl-iedenberg gave scientists the
“works” at their annml convention.

a *

“Experience has proved, and probably no
one would now deny, that knowledge can
advance, or at least can advance most
rapidly, only by means of all unfettered
search for truth on the part of those who
devote their lives to seeking it ill their re-
spective fields, and by complete freedom in
imparting to their pupils the truth they
have found." An old axiom is pointedly rc—
stated by Dr A. Lawrence Lowell, Harvard
president-emeritus.

 

OPEN FORUM l

Lottors are not always in oc-
oortlonoe with the policy of the
newspaper. Although iiutials
are permitted for publication,
letters to the editor must no
nooonipanied by the writer’s full
name.

To the editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:

In New Jersey the case went to
the Supreme Court; in Grinnell
the victim is quietly disposed of,
all condemning pictures destroyed,
and no mention of the incident
printed in the newspaper.

Even though the three minute
riot in the library on the night
of November 17 may be of
small consequence to some, to
others it involves a principle in
which dormant Grinnell students
seem to have no interest. After
all, there was no harm done. Ev»
oryone had a good laugh and
made a promise to himself that he
wouldn't do the same thing for
twice that much money. Is it the
fact that the offender was deliv—
ering a Communistio address that
frightened the authorities?

Heaven knows that anyone who
had been on this campus for even
a week would realize that nothing
more radical than a slight friend-
ship for the Democratic party has
swayed any but a few of the con-
servative eight hundred. Was
there a suspicion that the ensuing
publicity would be unfavorable?

No wide-awake prospective stu—
dent would shun a school in which
there was felt an active interest
in the issues of the day. (For in—
deed, the outside newspapers
would be very likely to claim that
here is a hot-bed of Communism.)

However, all speculations are in
vain, Grinnell students have no
interest in principles. Where oth-
er colleges and universities have
exciting, real elections involving
party politics, Grioneluans pass-
ively slgn on the dotted line and
then wait for the next issue of
the paper to find who happened
to win.
