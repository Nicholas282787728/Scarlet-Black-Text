Lecture Number 0n ”Playmakers
Of The People” Presents
Worth of Movement.

Expressing his faith in the folk play
as the real medium through which the
American people may express them-
selves, Professor Frederick H. Koch
justiﬁed his faith by experience in his
lecture in Herrick Chapel lastlevenlng
on the college lecture course. He
made himself a name as a producer of
Community drama while a‘memher of
the faculty of the University of North
Dakota and is continuing his work‘in
the University at North Carolina.
where he is professor of Dramatic Lit-
erature.

Professor Koch's subject last even~
ing was "Playmakers of the People"
and me great interest of the occasion
centered in the pictures which were
thrown upon the screen illustrating
the effects which were achieved on
the prairies of North Dakota by young
people who wrote their own plays, did
their own costuming and contrived
their own makeup. While the results
did not differ so greatly from those
which have been accomplished in
Grinnell on some occasions, they were
all the more interesting because the
young people of North Dakota were
pioneering with even icwer advan-
tages than the Young actors in Grin-
rrell have had. Some of the charac—
terizations thrown on the screen were
wonderfully good. '

Another interesting feature was the
manner in which these young people,
having left the stimulus or thc univer-
sity. had gone right ahead and in their
home communities continued to pro—
duce the folk plays which mean so
nnrch in the development and enrich~
ment of the community life,

Professor Koch is continuing the
same good work in North Carolina.
His talk was an inspiration to the
Grinnell people who are interested
along the same lines in which he has
been so succesful.

“100% FOR GRINNELL” IS
NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN

Meeting Full of Enthusiasm And
Pep As Alumni Respond fl‘o
Call For Backing.

(By Bur-ton Swart)

That the present generation of
Grrnnell students had shown a won-
derful spirit, and that the ‘alumni
would come across in the same loyal
fashion was the ccncensus of opinion
expressed at a meeting of sixty Grin-
hell men Monday night in Des Moines,
at an alumni banquet held at Harris-
Emery tea room.

w. P. hair. chairman of the Grad- '
uate'Council finance committee was
in charge of the program. President
Main outlined the reasons why Gr-ln-
nell needs an increased endow-ment.
and told his hearers that his greatest
difficulty was meeting business men
who tell him how hard the times are
and then turn around and ask him
why the college needs money. During
the war the colleges of the country
were bled white in an educational
way. and following the war they faced
either financial bankruptcy or educa-
tional and moral bankruptcy. There
was no choice for Grinnell as one of
the leading colleges of the country.

Liberal Arts nest

C. L. i-iulsizer. ’ﬂl), chairman oi the
Graduate Councill spoke of the great
value of the liberal arts college, and
told the men that the greatest service
they could do with their money was
to give it to Grinnell College that she
might continue her work in preparing
men to meet the needs of the econom—
ic world. which is for leader's, and not
detail worker-s. “Money contributed
to the best liberal arts school in the
United statesxghe said. "is one of
the best investments a man can make
of his money for the benefit of hu—
manity." ‘

Gerard S. Nollen, '02, appealed to
the loyalty of the alumni through the
indomitable spirit shown by Grinrrel-
liarrs. “The students of Grinuell have
risen to the situation in u“ uderful
shape," be said. “I think it is mar—
vclous. When a Grinnell man meow
a tough problem he does not cringe.
and Grinnell must raise this million
dollars from the alumni: We have got
to bring home the fact that this is the
greatest opportunity we have evcl: had
to show the Grinncll Spirit." He
then outlined the general plan, stating
that it would be necessary for the
college to secure an average of slot
a year fr-orn,each colurnnus tor five
Years; and that this would mean that
many of those present would need rn
give thousands. The plan outlined
for the work in Des illoines consists
of a series of group luncheons, six
men to‘ be present at each, and two
from each group being present at the
next luncheon. The luucheons started
Tuesday, and v i lost for a'bout four
weeks.

\l'us Spontaneous

Mr. H. s. McCowau speaking or the
student campaign described it as a
spontaneous combustion that occurred
in Grinnell. ‘It could not help but
touch the heart of any alumnus to see
the students mortgaging their future
for four or five years. “There never-
have been classes that have been other
in loyalty. in spirit and in generosity
than those classes in college.

A. L. Lawrenson, ’93, of Cleveland,
Ohio, gave a few remarks on his re-
action toward the campaign, and after
congratulating the Des Moines people
on such a time meeting, said that the
G rnnell vocabulary knew no such
word zis railurc. Others who were
called upon to give their reactions
toward the campaign were Ralph
Moor-head, George Weber, B. d. Holly,
