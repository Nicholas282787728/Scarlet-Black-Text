Percussion Ensemble

A multicultural music extravaganza performed by
malletswielding Gtinnell students and community
members takes place tonight. The Grinnell College
Percussion and Marimba Ensemble will be perform-
ing in Sebting-Lcwis Hall at 7:30 pm

“We have a nice mix of music for this concert.
There's some African, some Latin; something for w
cryonc," said Jamie Zwiebel ‘03, who plays the xy10r
phone, vibraphone and marimba.

Along With the multi—cultural music of the concert,
the audience will be treated to a collection of unusual
instruments collected from all over the world “I play
these hell things that are apparently from India, and
I’ve never seen them before in my life," said Alison
Link ‘08.

“We’ll feature several large pieces as well as some

of them to be in SebtingrLewis on
Dec. 10 at 7:30 pm. for the Jazz
Band concert.
According to Andrew Aus-
tin-Petersen ‘06, who plays the up-
right hass, this year there will he twice
as many students in the hand.
With such a large group comes a
greater diversity of music and a greater
audience appeal. This year the band will
play many different types of music in order to
appeal to jazz aﬁcionados and reluctant listeners alike.
“We’re trying to cover a few different bases. We've
got a few Count Basie charts, that’s going to be old
style, big hand, swing. We've got a funk tune, that’ll

smaller chamber pieces," said conduc t o r
Mark Dorr. “The individual students are tosponr
sible for the chamber pieces.” soloists will include
guitarist Evan Miller ‘07 in “Hernando’s Hideaway,"
xylophonist Aly Beety ‘05 in “Charleston Capers,"
and drummer Darren McNabb ‘07 in “Suite for 5010
Drum Set and Percussion Ensemble."

Featured composers will range from Henry Mans
cini to John cage, whose piece “Living Room Music"

hit with a mallet to make music.

he pretty fun.We've got a Latin number as well, Latin
boogaloo," said Ben Cohn ‘08.

“Our music will take Michael Jackson to that spe-
cial place, in a different way. Hopefully a better, licaltllr
iet way," said Colin Tschida ‘05, trombone player.

The “gospel influences"ofthe music should bring
Jesus to the concert, added Ben Cohn ’08, also of the
trombone section.

Austin-Petersen had another reason to attend, “If
you don't like jazz, you don't like jazzl suppose. But
come see your fellow studcntsThcy'vc worked hard
and they’re going out on a limb with their solos and
their improvising."

Whether you are ajazz fanatic, someone excited to
see some impiovising,just the roommate ofa trumpet
player, Michael Jaeltson or Jesus, band members feel
sure that this ycar’s concert is sure to please.
