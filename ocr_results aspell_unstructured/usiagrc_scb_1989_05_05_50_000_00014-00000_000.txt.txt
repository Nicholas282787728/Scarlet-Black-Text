Golfers try to pull
into second place

The Grinnell golf team has
some catching up to do this
weekend when the Iowa colleges
convene the last 187hole rounds
of the Midwest Conference
southern-division cumulative
competition. Friday‘s meet will
be zit Cornell, Saturday’s at Coe,
while Grinnell plays host Sunday
at Oakland Acres. Winners are
determined by their fiverround
aggregate scores.

After the first two sessions of
conference play in Illinois, the
Pioneers are in the middle of the
pack, just a stroke behind Illinois

College but 17 behind Knox, last

season's divisional and conference
champion. Last year, Grinnell
finished runner-up to the Siwush,
while tying for third in the con-
fercncc meet.

Coach Edd Bowers indicated
that his players need to regain
their concentration and consis
tency, which was lacking last
weekend at the Drake Relays In~
vitational. The Pioneers finished
next to last in a powerful 24,
team rleld. Darin Vig led with a
S4rhole total of 241, finishing
with ti 76 the final day. Craig
Junio shot a 77 the first day in
Des Moines,

RBIs, and Jahn, who compiled
two singles and an RBI.

The Pioneers continued their
105ng ways Tuesday, when they
droptxtd a doubleheader to CDC, a
team which has undergone a
complete lSO-dcgrcc tum for the
better. Assessing the defeats,
Martinek claimed. “Against Coe
we beat ourselves." Too bad they
don’t get a consolation win for it.

Grinnell will close out their
‘89 campaign with two difficult
doubleheaders on the road. To-
morrow Grinnell must face Illi-
nois College and then Lravel back
to Illinois on Tuesday for a pair
with Monmouth.

Caught in an unenviable
slide. and assured of spending
playoff time in good ol' Grinnell,
one would gather that there is

little, if any, incentive to finish
off the regular season. Martinek
disagrees. adding, ”These are my
last games as a coach here and I
don twant to go out losing. And
I know till the seniors on the hall
club want to end their college m,
reers on a high mark. I deﬁnitely
believe our guys will avenge the
loss against I. C —they have
something to prove. ” May the
force be with you.

Album

Scott has tried to bury his
glaring lack of melody under
frenzied playing of a myriad of
traditional instruments. but more
often this results in a muddled
mix and an abundance of rather
extraneous runs from the man»
dolins and riddles that run wildly
above Scott‘s droning.

The other major problem
with Scott's songwriting is his
complete inability to write any
thing like a bridge or a good

hooking chord change—his songs
go on lor countless minutes. re-
peating the same two- or three»
chord progressions without
variation while he moans and
wheezes his rather trivial lyrics.
Songs go on far too long; indeed,
it sounds as if someone forgot to
fade, or forgot to tell everyone to
stop playing.

There are two decent songs on
the album, but one was written
by Van Morrison (“Sweet

Thing,” which was on Morri»
son's incredible Astral Weeks
LP). and the other is a Irish
traditional called "When Will We
Be Married?” Scott manages to
completely butcher Morrison's
beautiful song (Morrison didn‘t
tend to write for a three-note vo-
eal range) and the virtues of the
Lraditional are certainly no fault
of Scott and his arrangement.

The best thing here is the tiv
the track. “Has Anybody Here

Marricd'l", and “When Ye Go
Away” are passable, but the rest
is just downright dull or even
grating Of particular annoyance
is the W. B Yeats poetry- comer
song- lyrics that make up "The
Stolen Child " a terribly lame al-
bum closer

Fisherman’s Blues certainly
is a far cry from the Waterboys‘
best moments from the past,
such as the anthemic “The Whole
Of The Moon," from the album
This is the Sea. But then again,
the end of 1988 proved to be
quite a time for hands making
lame attempts to dig up their
roots. The Waterboys have cer-
tainly uprooted themselves.
