Hell Week help

By BEN KING

It’s that time of the semester: soon
we will all step into the academic ﬁre
and brimstone of Hell Week. But before
you submit yourself to a week of agoniz-
ing, last-minute study, there are some
things you should know.

Because with a little planning, you
can make your trek toward the ninth
circle of ﬁnals more Like Dante’s benign
journey through the Iry‘Errm and less like
the plights of the sufferers he met along
his way.

Sleep enoug h

"I’m a big proponent of sleep," said
Joyce Stern, director of Academic Ads
vising. “Unfortunately," Stern lamented,
“sleep tends to be one of the ﬁrst things
to go."

studies have shown sound sleep is
essential for quality learning and thinks
ing. Whether you’re studying for a test
or trying to come up with a thesis state-
ment for a paper, you'll have a much
easier time if you get a good night’s rest.

With sleep deprivation, "for a time
there may be a feeling of a ‘high’ or the
ability to focus intensely," Stern said.
“But ultimately the sleep deﬁcit actus
ally creates tremendous problems in fo~
cus—problems working eihriently. And
of course, when you have a lot to do, you
want to be as efficient as possible."

Karen Cochran, director of Grin-
nell's Health services, advocates sleep,
too. “You start lackingsleep, then your
immune system gets compromised," she
said.

With students having recently re-
turned from Thanksgiving break, there
are many new “germs ﬂoating around."
Cochran encourages anyone experienCr
ing a high temperature, a cough or head
aches over to the Health Center.

Plan ahead

Another thing that can hinder your
clficicncy is the daunting appearance of
work that piles up at the end of the 58,
mester. “One of the ways to deal with
the end of the semester, as frightening
as it might be, is simply to map out the
remainder ofthe semester,"Stcrn said.

Highlight the ﬁnal deadlines oflatgr
er projects and then work backwards to
create “sub due dates" for the different
stages of the project.

“I thinkone of the things students do
is get overwhelmed by large projects
because they’re not thinking of [them]
as a set ofsmall steps," Stern said. While
writing a paper at the last minute some
times works, it’s incredibly stressful.

However, the buildup of work at the
end of the semester isn’t entirely attrib-
utable to procrastination. Stern pointed
out that, in many classes, much more

than half the work is due after the 5g,
mester’s halfway point. “The ﬁrst htlror
the semester is ideally when students are
doing a lot of preparation work," Stern
said. YThe second half of the semester
is when students need to demonstrate
their learning in a variety ofvmys."

Sometimes, ﬁiture worries add to
cudsofstho semester stress, and can’t
necessarily be vnnquished with good
planning. Kelly Eldridge ‘07 has “a lot of
long papers due" in die last couple weeks
of class, but is particularly concerned
that the grade she’s getting in one of her
classes will prevent her from being ad-
mitted to the study abroad program she
wants to attend next year.

Sollie Flora ‘07 cited the proliferar
tion of extrircun’iculnr events like con,
certs and plays as an additional source
of stress: “There are all these wonderful
things to do all ofa sudden!”

What to do and where to go when the
end of the semester gets you stressed

Be nice to yourself

Cochran mentioned the importance
oftaking study breaks, eating "a balanced
diet using common sense" and keeping
consistent bedtimes and wake-up times
to help the body and mind cope with
stress.

Eldridge likes to combine study
breaks and a balanced diet. With friends,
she sometimes likes to “plan dinners
when: we don't go to rhe dining hall."
Instead, they hang out and cook their
own food, taking a break from their nor-
mal routines.

Stern reminded students of the val—
ue of exercise and spending time with
friends. "For example, spend a vigorous
20 minutes playing picksup basketball at
the PEC. Take a half hour walk with a
friend before dinner or borrow a yoga
rape and do some stretching."

But it might be a good idea to avoid
dwelling too heavily on your academic
woes when you're with friends. Anna
McNulty ‘06 observed that “the freak-
out is contagious."

If people around you are stressing
out, you’ll catch the stress, too. “At this
time you‘re almost supposed to be com-
plaining," Brian Ewing ‘07 added.

Stern also recommended using
RLCs as confidants or going to walk-in
counseling available in the Forum base-
mcnt.1‘he counselors will deal with any
thing that’s bothering you.

Students should be more willing to
get help dealing with their stress, Stern
said. “There's this whole pride compo-
nent involved, and I think students like
to think,‘0h,1 can handle this,” she said.
“I'd like to see students feel that seeking
help is just part of their daily patterns.“

And remember, if Dante made it
to Paradise, you can make it to winter
break. Only two more weeks!
