Professor De Matte,

It is probably unucccssary to
call attention to the lecture Satur-
day evening. March 6th, by Prof.
J. B. De Molte. The lecture to
be given on the subject “Python
Eggs and the American Boy.” is a
sequel to the“Harp of the Senses"
which won universal favor last
year. A packed house greeted the
lecturer on that occasion and it is
safe to predict that standing room
will be at a premium Saturday
evening. The Y. M. c. A, plan
will be followed with the modify
cation that no children untlcr ten
will be admitted unaccompanied
by patent or guardian.
