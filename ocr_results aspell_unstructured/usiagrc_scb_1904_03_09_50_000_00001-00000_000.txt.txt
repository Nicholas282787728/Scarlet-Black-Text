NEW LAW ADVOCATED.

A Change Suggested horn Present
Method at Granting State
Certiﬁcates.

The Eytc of Ccditl
Falls, In a recent issue discusses
to some extent the present system
of granting state certiﬁcates to
teachcrs arid the proposed change
and is of the ﬁrm belief that as
long as the greater per cent of
their graduates pass, that there is
no need for reform.

Under the present law, gradu
ates from all colleg are required
to take an examination betor a
certiﬁcate will be issued permit
ting them to teach in Iowa. On
account of this the graduate fresh
from college ﬁnds it rather dlf‘ﬁ'
cult to pass a strict examination
in the common branches because
the subjects have become rather
rusty from want of useI and as he
does not wish to teach them, it is
a waste of time and often places
the candidate in a peculiar posi.
tion to be compelled to study all
of these things before he is allow-
ed to instruct in the branches for
which his college course has ﬁtted
him.

Tire proposed change is that
state certificates be issued to all
graduates hum colleges of recog
nized stantliu his would remedy
the dctectanrl give persons who
destre to teach Liitin a chance to
teach it and nut be compelled to
talte du

examination in tht: mulli-
plication titblcs.

We are willing to admit that
many college graduates are not
suited for teachcrs but it is also
true that there are just as many
graduates from Normal schools

* who ought to be washing dishes
or sawing wood instead of teach-
ing school, although they are able
to passa satisfactory examination.

The student's Congress of Ultlr
versrty of California has adopted
a new policy ot debating questions
pertaining to student life and ac
tivilics. They believe that it will
be more proﬁtable and just as
interesting as to discuss the great
questions of the day,

A business session of the Y. M.
C. A. will be held immediately
following the regular meeting too
morrow evening. The ofﬁcers
are to be elected for the coming
association ycar,

The managers of SCARLET AND
BLACK are not less dissatis-
ﬁed witti the local delivery service
than are the subscribers. Ill!’
provcmcnt may be expected in
the immediate future.

the point of View of the treasurer,

The method of election has as

to take part in the nomination,

Clow too may be depended

ofDad Green in the weights is
liltcly to show Grinncll up to
better advantage in that depart-

that points may be found for the

It will be seen from the fore-

THE CORNELL DEBATE FRIDAY

Last Year's Contest Won by Grlnncll

Enthusiasm and Persevei‘aiice~—~W

Still Have the Perseverance,

In years past, Giiiincll's dcbab
lllgsplrltllz experienced severe
checks. ller activrty in that line
otwoili has not been buoyed up
with the exaltatriin of victory, but
through years of defeat and other
discouragenreuts she struggltd
on with dogged tenacity, and not
until last you was, her persever-
ance lewditlcd. The winning ot
last year‘s Cornell debate is fresh
iii the minds of us all. A more
enthusiastic crowd of students

upon those three men and they

did not disappoint us. we had

liatl other contests Cornell
in years brit the result of
these lent encouragement
and so we look back upon that
victory of March i3 last, as a
laurel truly won and a victory
which we dearly prize.

The question submitted by the
corrieiliuiis for this yearis, Re~
solved that a system of batik
notes based 0.! national bonds is
preferable to a system of bank
notes based on the general assets
of our National Banks. Grinnell
has chosen to defend the negative.

For the past fetv months our
men have been working indus»
triously to master this most diffi-
cult question. It is indccd a lteen
test of a man's intellect to debate
the issue of bond and asset cur~
rency.

In Mr. Ryan the team has a
most capable coach and to his
earnest \vcult much praise is due.
Mr. Paul is the olily man who was
a member of last year's team. He
is a Chrcstorriathian by polllics.
l\’1r,Weher and Mr. C. Brown,the
oilier two men are Institute-s.

The date of the contest is Fri-
