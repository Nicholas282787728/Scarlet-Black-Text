From poverty and obscurity to a '

royal throne is a far jump for an Am-

el'ican youth. Am] when the pretend— .
er to the throne objects to his oocu- ‘
pancy and hires assassins to remove '
the new monarch, who is a determined =

and athletic young man, there is apt
to be considerable excitement. This is
one or the threads of the new Art
