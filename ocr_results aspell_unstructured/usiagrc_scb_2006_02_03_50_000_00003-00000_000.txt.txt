Forum toasted
on its way out

3v KWON YANG

on a typical day at the Forum, students pore over
books while the atmosphere hums with ambient chats
ter. Some wander in to get a fut quick ofjava before
morning classes, others take a seat to frantically fin-
ish homework assignnicnts,wliile many just hang out
and chat.

During its 42 years of existence, the Forum has
been a popular gathering place for students, with food,
drinks, games, student and staffoeriees, and popular
speakers. But all this wtll change next year when the
toe Roseniield ’25 campus center opens, taking over
almost all of the Forum's current functions. With the
close oftl'te Forum looming, the college hosted a “40
Years of the Forum" event yesterday to commemorate
the building and its history

The Forum was builrty m 1954, and planned by
modernist architect Walter Netsch,who also designed
Hurling library and the college’s old arts building.

Project designer Robert Peters was or. hand for
the Forum event yesterday. He said the Forum was
designed with the aim to make it “a living room of
the campus."To that end, the building was intention-
ally planned in a nonelincar mariner. “On the upper
level you can make a loop all the way around from
one room to the next to the next,” said Peters. “You
can go there at any hour and walk through [to] find
something that interested you.

Students at the Forum enjoy the environment.
“It’s a comfortable place to hang out and work,” said
Anne Borkowski ’09. “I like the fact that you can see
the train [from here]."

Pavitra Kannan ’07 agreed. “I think it's comforts
ing," she said. “During ﬁnals week, it was a great place
to relieve stress.”

Jenny Anger, Art, a pdnellsl at the Forum mm,
memoration, said her favorite part of the building was
the South Lounge. “To me it’s wonderful to have the
open windows so you have a sense ofconncction with
the whole community,"she said, "And yet there's also
a sense of intimacy to the space,"

For Lauren Etzkom ‘08, feelings for the Forum
were more basic. "I like the yogurt,"shc said.

Ray Ybarra:
activist

Ray Ybarra grew up in Douglas, Texas one

block from the giant steel fence that separated

the United States and Mexico. In 2005,he was chosen as one ofsut

Ira Glasscr Racial Justice Fellows by the American Civil Liberties

Union (ACLU) in order to facilitate his research on bordererclated

issues and is currently tWOryear leave from Stanford Law School,

Ybarra recently visited the Grinnell campus to participate in panel

discussions on border issues and to show his documentary, Farms
I'ngvi'llc.

Couldyau ex lain what 1'1 mean: to be a Ratio/juttite Fellow?

What the CLU did was they put out a call for proposals on
anything having to do with racial Justice in the United states Ese
sentially what they wanted to do was highlight the fact that they feel
racial justice is still a very valid concern for them. People tmditionr
ally associate First Amendment and separation of church and state
issues with [the ACLU] but racial justice is a strong component.

So reteioiirg MirﬂI/owrhtf ii woo; allowcdyou to toiidrtrzyorirpity—

[The ACLU] give you the twoeycar salary and then they give
you the ofﬁce space. They bought me my camera and my [micro-
phone] and all that stuff so I could do the documentary I’m not
really accountable to anybody, 1 don’t have a boss or anybody I have
to report to or be in the ofﬁce at a cettnin time. Ijust go out and
cause trouble.

My hope is when I go back to law school to be able to con-
tinue my work at the ACLU and expand it and get some more
people to work with me or start a new organization based on all
the experiences that I've had these two ycats that deals really more
comprehensively with the issue of immigration oii u global level
and also to look at the human rights aspect as opposed to civil or
constitutional rights.

I would have undocumented immigrants themselves to or
ganize and decide for themselves that we need to do something
different than what's happening right now. There aie barriers be-
cause, legally, it's hard for them to travel and get together but that
would be my one dream: to have the undocumented community
come together and make their own decisions about how they want
to proceed.

You Illctltivnt‘d ill: iﬂZ'UI o/t'mttn'gration on border remnant/tat.

one of the things that's really missing right now from the dis
cussion about immigration is the effects our policies have on bore
dcr communities. Mainly on Latinos who live near the border
[Tlhat mentality ofsccing armed federal agents every day, ofseelng
helicopters ﬂy over your house, ofhaving a gigantic steel fence with
stadium lights and sensors in your backyard really sends the mar
sage that you are atwat. And your personal liberties are going to be
restricted until the day you die

How do you martin/or apparent/y atom! appeal of Matt: militia

i think the broad appeal or the anti immigrant groups the
vigilantes, is fear" .And it's the sonic strategy thats been used by
demagogues throughout the course of history Fear is a great way to
organize people and get them to see something your way.

Students will be responsible for the movement towards human
rights with regard to migration and I think it's their obligation, as
people of privilege. to reach our to communities that don’t have as
many opporntn tes as they have been fortunate to have and create a
space to organize and assisting in organi» ng.
