Housing Committee selects Dagohir and international Gourmet Houses to
ﬁll campus—owned houses in 2004-2005; Music House will be no more

by Josh Cooley

There will still be a lot of noise coming from 1128
East Street next year, but instead ofmusic, it will be the
cianging orpors and pans.

Music House, ofﬁcially renamed Freesound House,
was hoping to extend its residency at 1128 East street
into the 20042005 school year, but it was not selected
by the Housing Committee to continue its reign. In»
stead, the committee chose Interna-
rional Gourmet House to occupy
1123 East street.

Bright ideas

Newly-formed Lighting Committee
recommends increased illumination
on campus paths to improve
campus security; cost is an issue

by Marko Mircetic

Residence Life Coordinator Stephanie Masta found
nights at Grinnell College diasticaliy different {torn rhosc
at Arizona State Universinr, her previous employer. While
Giinncll's lighting is subdued and security is less intru-
sisic, “at A51), you had to go through two doors and
keyezirtl both of them to get in," said Masta, As she
switched positions. Arizona state had begun a program
to cvaliure outdoor lighting and add natures as neces.
suty.

Grinnell College has prepared for similar changes
in response to increased concern. Assault and harass-
menr reports have convinced manysrudenis orihe need
for greater security measures. Administrators have pre
pared for future incidents by forming the Lighting Comv
mittee, winch has recommended adding multiple ﬁx-
tures to several spots on campus.

According to Jonathan Brand, vice presidenr orin—
siiiutional and Budget Planning, the recommendations
of Ill: committee will b: Followed, and the college will
implement new lighting over the next couple oryears,
Safety, according to Brand, is of “paramount impor»
lance.”

The extended amount ortime required to meet the
demand for lighting is a matrei oreosr accordingto Rick

Whitney, who coordi-
nates Facilities
Managements construc»

"Shady characters

prefer the dark. projects. Each iamppost

—Steve Bﬁscoe, costs $1900, not includ-

. . ing its concrete base or
director ofSecunty installation lahor. This

fee is a result orrhe con»
struction of the lamps,
as they employ optical refractors and thus offer a het-
rerclir environment than the College’s previous fixtures.

Aesthetic concerns also weigh heavily upon cost.
“You want lights that are warm, thar are inviting," said
Brand. As such, the college has decided to purchase ere
elusiveiy Washington Contracline model lamps from the
Moldcast Corporation.

Security guard Robert Schultz has noticed a fault or
these lamps, as they are prone to accumulate warer or
ice on occasion. “In a heavy precipitation area, why
would you use lights that leak?" asked Schulia. Whitney
noted that this problem occurs occasionally, but has not
been a signiﬁcant issue for Pac ties Management.

orspirc the addition of lighting, Masta points out
thar many aitas nfzhe campus are inaccessible at nighr.
“\Vharl hnd sriilsing is that iii wanted to cut across
Mac Pield, it's really dailt," she said.

The new campus center will assuage rhis concern as
well. “Every architect wants lighting to he exciting, so
that their building becomes a beacon,” said Brand.

Light pollution, which is a particular concern to Bob
Cadmiis, Physics, and the campus observatory, has Iii“-
iied the expansion oFlighring and enrolled emissions
from future building projects, however. The uhiliry to
see stars at night remains important to the college and
students in general.

in response, all new lights on campus will eventu»
ally be ﬁtted with dark sky shields, which act as a scar.
Fold ro renter light downward. This measure ”will prob-
ahly increase the light around campus," said Brand.

sieve Briscoe, director or Security/t succinctly sure
mised the argument: “shady characters prefer the dark,"
said Bl'iscoe. Hr maintains that the college will cone
tiuually evaluate lighting and alter it when necessary.
