Pompous writing only muddle "the
meaning and makes the reader work to
understand what is being said, which
should not happen if uie writing is “eloe
quent and precise." Edwin Newman ilr
lustrated this point in Strictly Speaking
when he described an interview bet-
ween a BBC correspondent and a
member of the British miners‘ union.
At the time, the union leaders were not
too popular with the members.

BBC MAN: Do you want an election?

MINER: Yes

BBC MAN: Why?

MINER: To get the buggers out.

I am glad l-loldridge did not answer,
because he probably would have said,
“Their parameters and holistic ap-
proach do not correspond with the
ideologies of myself and my ilk." You
want the buggers out!

Holdridge also has a problem with
mixing, "Occasionally, questions oi
academic reorganization have per-
sisted ior several years." Either ques-
tions persist or they pop up occasional
ly, but not both.

All of this weakens the language and
makes his point less understandable. A
writer should be clear and concise, not
pompous, mixedrup. and redundant.

Jors do not know how to read or writet, I
probably made some errors in my

Clariﬁes ANM

To the Editor: I would like to clarify
the history and role of the Association
for New Music (8&3, Oct. ill. The ANM
was not cooked up tor want oi a Jazz
Band; in fact, it is the Jazz Band, but
redirected, and it was planned by
myself, John Jensen, and Richard
Strunk at the end oi last semester. For
the most part, the Jazz Band played
stock big»band arrangements, some of
which were more boring than others.
Last semester l experimented wiui
some improvised cencerti grossi, in the
style oi Sun Ra, tor a change of pace.
After that, we decided to move the
ensemble in the direction of chamber
jazz and new music New music means
new composition-improvisations that
we do, new ways of arranging old tunes,
new mixedmedia pieces, and music
new on this campus. I quote from John
Jensen's address to the ensemble on its
lirst meeting: “Proposition: Above all ,
. . we must change our past ways,"
Finally, I would like to thank Paul
Stiles for being involved, and inform
listeners that Terry King will be
assouated with us in the future —Dave

Stealing grades at Grinnell?

To the Editor: I guess I shouldn't be
surprised, but I never fail] to be amazed
at how low some of my fellow Grin-
nellians will stoop. Two days before the
first Microeconomics mid-term,
somebody tore out notes of a week of
classes from my notebook, which was
sitting in my library carrel.

This is not the first time I have been
the victim of such despicable behavior.
Two springs ago, someone stole my
Macroeconomics notebook a week
before the final tand returned it the day
of the final), and last spring, my Cam-
paigns and Elections notebook was
lifted from my Carrel and never return-
ed. [hear such ﬁlching is not unusual 7
and even commonplace in the science
building.

Such irresponsible and selfish'
behavior is incomprehensible to me.
Are professors fostering such cuti
throat competition in their classes? Is
student anxiety about getting into
B-school or med school so high that they
are reduced to stealing the property at
others? I prefer to believe that educaf
tion is a cooperative rather than a com»
petitive eftort, and I am certainly
always willing to let anyone borrow my
notes 7 ii people would only ask rather
than take

While the obvious lesson [or me is to
guard my notebooks with my life land
to call for the installation at lockers in
Burling), l continue to be outraged and
bewildered at such appalling behavior
on the part of my fellow students. —

Dissatisfied with interviews

To the Editor: We have read the artir
clc about the language assistants in the
5&3 issue Volume 39, Number 5. We ap-
preciate the fact that your newspaper
devoted a whole page to us. However,
we are very disappointed to iind
ourselves portrayed as {our
stereotyped, happy tourists. We strong-
ly disagree with the main points oi this
journalistic attempt to make a sketch of
the four different language assistants.
We know that the author of this article
has but little experience with Jour-
nalism.

We wish the writer had realized how
much harder it is to interview persons
who are non-native speakers and
therefore need more specific, more sen-
sitive questions and more time to
answer them. We also wonder what the
editor-in-chief has in mind when he
proof-read the article,

Besides some minor mistakes like
poor style, printing, and grammar
twluch we are embarassed to notice)
we criticize the article as a whole
because lt does not go beyond basic. Ii"
relevant and sometimes i even
misleading information about us; (the
Russian assistant's name is Nedlinll,

The information in the article is not

presented in the way in which we gave 7
it. We dislike the boring make up of the ~
article which exhausts itself in {our ,
repetitive and shallow descriptions oi
four happy ioreigners, At the end of die
page there is nothing much left of the-
four “individuals” whom the writer in-,
tended to Write about.

We also do not approve of the way the.
interviews were held, Neither was the.
interviewer sufficiently prepared, nor
did we have enough time to think about-
answers, which could have provided.
substantial iniormation about,
ourselves, our work, our traveling ,
plans and perhaps, a more complex.

We hope that our critique is justiﬁed
and that the concerned persons can see
