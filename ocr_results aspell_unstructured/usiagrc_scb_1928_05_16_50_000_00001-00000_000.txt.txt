which was held in Herrick chapel last
night at o. The award of fifty dol—
lars was given to hlr. Hawk tor the
best delivered oration of the nine
which were presented during the Cone
test. Hawk, a freshman living in

ning lresbman affirmative debate”
team.

The subject ot the winning speech
was "American Ideal." it is a declac
mation from Henry Russell Miller.
The speech was centralized about
America's ideal of peace and world
organization during and since the
World War. The worthiness of the
cause and the sacrifice that America
made to live up to the ideal were
illustrated by stories. of the war as
witnessed by the author.

Stiller Wills Second.

Lester Stincr. speaking on “Clean
‘Governmenv' won the second prize of
th 3 dollars. Stiner's speech was
one given by Senator Box-ab. Stincr

Nebr. He was a member of the fresh-
man debate team and was a Merrill
debatcr.

"it is a known fact that government
officials of high position go into port»
ncrship with crime, but the future of
the Republican party depends on how
the Republicans propose to meet this
fact. There can be no more import:
ant issue than that or clean govern.
ment in the next election. The people
of this country have a great interest
in this national question and an in-
stinct that is sure."

The third prize of twenty dollars
was won by Rudolph Gilbert, a freslle
man from lowa Falls. Gilbert pre-
sented an original oration on "Al
Smith and the Presidency." His talk
was a plea on behalf of the younger
generation that the older generation
uphold the strong constitution. He
did not approve of Al Smith for presi—
dent because Smith is a wet while
America is fundamentally dry. He did,
however, uphold Smith as a Demos
crat, as a Catholic, and as a clean
politician.

Six Others Compete.

Six other men were contestants for
the Spaulding prize. The nine final
contestants were chosen alter a ser-
ies of two elimination tryouts. Clar-
ence Jacobson talked on "The Field of
Conflict in Industry," concerning the

Mile Relay Team Shows Up Well
In Triangular Meet Held On
Ward Field Saturday.

 

Although no track or meet records
were broken last Saturday at the trie
angular meet between Grinnell, Ames,
and Drake, some of them were ser~
iously threatened at various times
during the afternoon.

Perfect weather and a fast track
made an ideal setting ior display lg
speed, tossing “sights, and jumping
over bars. An cxceptional example
of this speed was presented late in
the meet when McKee clopped olf the
quarter in :49.’l‘. McKee shot out in
front of the other entres and increas—
ed his lead with every step, He lonrr
ed slightly as he neared the tape
which slowed up his last time.

Grinnell's only other first place
winner in the individual events was
lngram who won the broad juillp with
a leap of 21.45 feet.

ltrlur Todiu Shous Class.

Grinnell' .mile relay team showed
real class in its event. Following the
sun. Mark ran neck and neck with
Penqulte of Drake during the first
quarter. Penquite met his second
man about five yards in front of
Mark. Then followed one of the pret-
tiest demonstrations of the afternoon.
Taylor with a five yard lead against
him succeeded in not only passing his
man but left him about fitteen yards
in the rear. Barnes, Crinnell's third
man lost about five yards, but McKee
casily crossed the tape ahead of the
Ames man.

A surprise was sprung in the jnvee
liu throw when Laird failed to win the
contest, After leading the other ene
tries most of the time, he was finally
beaten out by Briggs oi Allies. He
finished second in the javalin with a
toss of 170 feet, He also iinished sec—
ond in the discuss which he hurled
123,6 feet.

.U', MAY 16, 19 s.

— Old Timer Recalls Tornado of 1882

As 1929 Cyclone Descends On Dorms

Differing from the 1352 tornado one,
ly in the length of time it took to
cause the same havoc, the 1929 cy~A
clone culminated in civil war between
the dormitories, twenty three broken
windows in Smith hall, and various
injuries to the appearance and feel-
ings of the buildings up the line.

The disastrous effects of the cy-
clone were said to have been due to
an excessive hreezeiness in remarks
upon certain buildings on the Grinnell
campus. This brecziness aroused
gusts of anger in the breasts oi those
involved and resulted in a heavy rain
of ’Il'ish confetti (Arabian ror
brickbatsl and severe atmospheric
disturbances in the form of [ire-Cracks
crs and oth explosives.

Threatening weather signals in the
form of secret consultations and unit-
tered threats of vengeance preceded
the coming of the storm. However,
the weather prophet predicted no such
deluge as that which came. At 11:30
lightening flashes in the pity oi
Smith hall started the storm proper
w ich massaged the h ck walls of
Smith hall. The electrical disturb-
ances in the air must have oifcctcd
the lighting aparatus in the first
building of the campus group [or line
mediately all the lights went out.
The walls stood the barrage very well.
lt was the windows which gavc way
ﬁrst, The symphony of breaking

gla , added to the sharp rcpo s of
tho firecrackers and the clamoring of
the mob betokcned the tact that Grin-
nell was being presented with a ty—
pboon in true Coni‘adeian style. At
twelve o'clock the storm 'had reached
its height and continued with intense
volume for another half hour when,
partly because it had spent itself of
its own force and partly because of
the interruption of several administra.
tive liososcs, who bid the troubled
waters reccdc, calm ‘was partially re-
stored. However the intermittent
thundering of tirecrackers up to two
o'clock caused rushes for safety on
the part of those within the stricken
area into the inner recesses of their
buildings. But at no time thereafter
did the “storm clouds gather"- to re-
produce such fury as had first been
experienced.

The complete results of the cyclollt;
could not be determined but the Come
mission on Building Construction and
Destruction has found, it said,
twenty-three broken window panes in

is

Smith and an Amount of damage in
other buildings va 'ng with the de-
gree of activity their inmates showed
in producing the first eruption. No
casualties have been reported but as
most injuries were probab internal
time will only tell the true extent or
the havoc.

Missouri Valley Meet.

Four men u ill represent Grinnell
at the Missouri Valley Tennis tour-n.-
mcnt, according to Coach J. C. Trues-
dale, Mlich will be held at Lincoln
next Friday and Saturday, May is
and 19.

The lour men who will leave Thur
day for Lincoln are Coggeshall, Stru-
ble. Jones, and Stowe. rated in the or-
der named. Drawings will take place
early Friday morning and the first
matches will start at 11 o'clock. The
finals in both the singles and daubles
will occur on Saturday afternoon

Upon the shoulders of Coggeshall
rests the task of defending his title of
Missouri Valley Collegiate champion
which be attained at the tournament
last spring, It looks as if Coggeshail‘s
foremost adversary would be Mason of
Oklahoma, who has displayed a fine
brand of tennis so far this year. Howe
ever, Coggeshall succeeded in dispos-
ing of Mason on the southern trip. and
it is likely that he will repeat.

Each téam in the conference may
enter {our singles players and two
doubles tennis. For Grinnell, Coggee
shall and Stl-uble will work together-
in the doubles as they have heretofore
this year, as Will Jones and Sowe.
These men have an unusually brilliant
season behind them in preparation for
the Valley tournament, and much is
expected of them.

 

Student Publications

Have Successful

Season In Bringing Honors to Campus

Grinnell’s student publications, from
a standpoin of number oi honors re-
ceived. have had an extraordinarily
successtul year. These honors seem
doublyvalunblc when it is considered
that Grinnell won them in competition
with schools and universities many
times its size. Grinnell college has
won favorable publicity throughout
the country, this past year, on the
merits of its publications alone.

The Malteaser was elected for trial
membership in the Midwest Comic as-
sociation, and now is practically Ase
surcd of permanent membership. This
midwestern association of college and
university humorous magazines in.
cludes the publications of the waiver
sities of Michigan, Minnesota, and
lowa, and ot a number of other large
schools. incidentally, Grinnell is
one of the very few colleges of its
size to put out a monthly comic maga-
zine.

The Tanager has been honored by
being mentioned by Edward J.
O'Brien, well known English critic, as
one of the thirty leading short story

 

magazines in the country. Mr. O'Brien
publishes each year a collection of
what he considers the best short stor-
ies of the year. Six smries which
appeared in the Tanager, all by either
undergraduates or faculty members,
were mentioned by Mr, O'Brien in his
1527 compilation. This magazine has
received favorable comment from the
prominent critic, H. L. Mencken.

At the recent convention of the Col-
lege Press association or lowa, the
SCARLET AND BLACK garnered sev-
eral honors. This paper was given
the sweepstakes cup for ﬁrst page
make-up. Also it won ﬁrst prize for
front page make—up in the six column
vapor division. In addition to these
firsts, the paper received first honor-
able mention. which amounted to sec-
ond prize, for its editorials. Last
year the ﬁrst prize in makeup of pa-
pcrs of six columns or over was won
by Grinnell.

The Cyclone, published each year
by the junior class, has long been
known as one of the better College
year books of lowa.

mediocrity but who, by spending f' -
teen minutes digesting a correspond
ence course, rose to the supreme
heights of social and business . life.
Howard Peck has contributcd a
sketch telling just what the chorus
girl iinds when she hunts for a job
via magazine in ”When the Chorus
Girl Reads}! 'A poem uFragments,"
by Ruth Atwater, an editorial by
Blayne MCCul‘ry and a number of
book reviews complete the student
contributions,

Moore Contributes.

Malteaser To Be
Issued Next Week

“Exchange Number" Will Mark
the Close of Present Year.

"The exchange number' 'of the Mal-
teaser, the last issue of the "Old Cat"
for this year, will make its appearance
on the campus early next week. The
edition might well be called the
“room-mate number," since all of the
material in it has been borrowed from
other college magazines, with the pur»
pose of giving Grinnell students an
opportunity of sampling the humor
from other campuses.

A clever cover dcslgn by Ruth
Thompson bringing out the exchange
feature is the only contribution by
stall members. A good selection of
Cuts has been obtained through the
courtesy of contemporary humor mag-
ilzines, and it is expected that the ex—
change numbor, marking an innova-
tion in the Mnlteaser's history, will be
sparkling with the efforts of the na-
tion's best college jokesmiths.
