State legislators pass ban on public smoking;

Administrators say state-wide ban probably will not affect Cleveland Lounge

BV PETER HENRY & SARAH MiRK

This week, lowajoined the numerous states and cities that
have passed public smoking bans in the last few years. A bill to
ban smoking in all public places, including bars and restaurants,
was passed earlier in the month by the Iowa state House and
yesterday passed in the Senate. Smokers in Grinnell may soon
be feeling the heat.

A modified version oftlic bill, known as the Smokefree Air
Act, passed through a State Senate committee on Monday The
bill attempts to reduce the health effects ofsecohdshand smoke
on restaurant and bar employees by banning smoking in publie
places, though it exempts veterans’huildings and casinos.

Unlike similar laws in other states, the bill would allow
people to smoke outside the doors of restaurants oi bars rather
than enact a smoke-free radius around entrances, which is of
ten around ten feet. Places where smokers have long consumed
cigarettes along with fries, like Lonnski‘s Deli and the AW
Cafe', would have to kick all smokers onto the sidewalks,

Jim Buffum, owner of Bowladrome on State Street, thinks
the smoking ban might
hurt his business. Buf-

up to each business to
decide," he said. “It’s like
telling me I can't smoke
in my own house."

While Grinnell students would certainly feel the ban's efs
fects in local restaurants and bars, Grinnell College administra—
tors said the campus, including the Cleveland smoking lounge,
will remain unaffected. If passed, Cleveland could become the
only smoke haven in town.

“If the state makes something applicable in public places,
we wouldn't have to follow it," said President Russell K. 05*
good. “This is the home for about 900 students; they aren’t
public buildings.”

Osgood said that since Grinnell is a private college, any
such state law would only affect the college ifit explicitly gave
money to the college to implement any similar regulation.

Still, an anti~ban sentiment smoldered in Cleveland lounge
on Monday afternoon. "My initial response is to be opposed to
[the ban] becausel am a smoker,"said Aimee Tabrizi ’10.

“It’s diﬁicult to immediately think of valid reasons why it
shouldn't happen, but it represents a more fundamental probe

Across Iowa, pub-

lic opinion on the ban
is mixed. A recent poll
from the Des Moines
Register showed 43
percent of Iowans
supporting the ban,
Those in opposition
mostly frame the issue
as one orpersonal libe
erties versus govern»
ment intrusion,

Despite cries of
excessive government
intervention, Iowa
legislators passed the
bill through. State
Senator Tom Rielly said that his office has received a mixed
response from business Owners. “Some restaurant owners were
concerned," Rieily said.

“Some were saying that if you exempt some places, there
would be an effect [on business]-—that iryou ban it you should
ban it for everyone, [but] I also had some restaurant owners
who were happy to have it out of restaurants because this low-
ered the playing ﬁeld for them,"

In a press release, State Representative Palmer expressed
strong support for the ban. ‘The smoke free bill approved last
night is one of the best public health initiatives in our history
and it will save thousands of lives," said Palmer.

Rielly said the regulations to enforce the ban could go into
effect by the end of the year.
