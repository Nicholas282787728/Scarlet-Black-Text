Thoughts on. coaches and

Boy, you guys (and gals) really do
have it toughi

I recently had the experience of be
ing a coach, It was just for tun,
nothing real important on the line. just
a iriendly game with unfriendly
players. The game was basketballiln-
tramural tIMt basketball to be
specific

The Go book, you remember that
square thing they sent you when you
were a freshman, describes IM sports
as a “marvelous opportunity for
everyone to get a little exercise and
display his/her physical ineptitude."
It goes on to repeat that it is just for
“fun,” and that it can “really help
round out your Grinnell
‘Experience'."

From the limited IM experience I’ve
had it seems like a blood and guts
league where winning is everything
And that‘s where coaching comes in.
it really isn't easy, in my own short
career I‘ve already been exposed to
the pressures of coaching.

The pressure I was forced to deal
with was, of course, the problem of in-
suring that everyone plays an equal
amount of time, while at the same
time trying to keep the best players in

A 7142 loss to Central in the first
round of action at the Iowa AIAW
Division III West Sectional Basketball
Tournament left Grinnell College

9 wins and 12 losses. Central, seeded -
second at the tournament, advanced to
linals betore bowing to top-ranked
Buena Vista, 64747.

in its final regular season game,
Grinnell dropped a 73771 thriller at
lowa Wesleyan last Tuesday.

the game so that we could win. 0b,
viously this kind of problem can really
only happen in something like m, but
think of all the pressures at “real”
coach has to face. Remember that
these are pressures laced by coaches
in general; they may or may not ap-
ply to coaches at a school like Grinnell
specifically.

The strongest pressure laced by
coaches, especially at larger schools,
is plain old winning and losing. A win-
ning team means more media ex-
posure, That benefits the school in two
ways: It serves as free publicity for
the school, and, in the cases of larger
schools, television coverage can mean
big bucks for the school’s coffers.

But when the team is losing, you can
ballk on the fact that the coach is the
one who takes all tlle blame Usually
it's the coaches who come and go,
while the players stay

Now that you have the basic
pressures that go with the job, let's
add some more:

Player attitudes and team morale,
Tllese two things, which can be very
important to a team’s periormance,

and in themselves effect a win/loss

record. are things that a coach has a
hard time controlling.

Discipline. Another important factor
in running a successful team, but also‘
extremely ditticult for a person to
judge. Let’s not forget that coaches
are people,

Then there are a slew of related
pressures that can have nothing to do
directly with the game at all, but that
a coach still has to deal with:

Racial problems. This problem ex-
ists on many teams and the tension it
causes among the team members, as
well as with the coach, can be
devastating,

Press of the opposite sex in the
lockeroom, It may sound trivial. but it,
too can draw the cons of the team
away from their prime objective,
playing the game.

I don't have a contract with the In- .

there is one) to write a pro coaches
story every year, but I have been
