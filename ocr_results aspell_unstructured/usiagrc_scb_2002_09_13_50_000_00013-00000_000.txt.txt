How to prepare for exams

All ofthe books I ve read about how to study torexnms
are wrong. These books claim that to do well on an exam,
you have to get a good nights sleep, take eopious notes.
highlight important pusagcs, make flashcards, have a lutky
pen, get together with friends to compare class notes, and
eat brain food. That
all might be true,
but what these ex»
perrs don't seem to
grasp is that i have

Realize the fruitlessness of cheating. Iwa
