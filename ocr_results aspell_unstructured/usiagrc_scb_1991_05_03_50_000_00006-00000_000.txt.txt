Students bid farewell to
German professor

We are but a few of the many
students who have enjoyed and
beneﬁtted from the leaching of
Stephen Hoilcnder, Assistant Pro-
fessorofGet-man.We are writing to
thank him for the wonderful job he
has done. We are also writing to say
goodbye, because the German de-
partment has chosen not to hire Mr.
Hollender for a tenure-track posi-
tion for nextyear. Instead they have
selectedaproiessorfrom outsideof
the college, seemingly disregard-
ingthe high recommendationsgiven
to Mr. Hollender by many German
students, We are saddened that slur
dent opinion carries so little weight
in decisions that affect the student
body directly. What saddens us
most. however. is that Grinnell
College is losing a great teacher.
We will do our best to try to keep
our dissatisfaction with the Ger—
man department’s decision from
biasing our opinion of the new pros
fessor next year, but we can hon-
estly say that she has some awfully
big shoes to fill.

Mr. Hollender, We have learned
from you. You have made a differ
eneein yourstudents lives, and you

will be missed because of it. Good
luckwith yournew job nextycar. It
really is Grinnell's loss.

Auf Wiedcrsehen,
Hollender.

Bastion of
conservation?

To Iho editor,

This is a matter Lhatl have been
pondering for some time, in tact,
ever since my freshman year two
years ago.

Grinnell is typically a bastion of
“omniconsciousness,” everraware
and on the lookout for injustice, If
there is progress to be made or
simply an impropriety to bepointed
out, it is a Grinnellian who usually
lakes it upon her/himself. That is
why I am so surprised at the exist-
ence of this most appalling situa-
tion.

Theissue ofwhichlspeak is one
that has been gotng on far too long
and unbeknownst to most of the
campus] am rereninglothelights
in dorm mechanical rooms and B
and G custodial closets that remain
lit 24 hours a day and are never
turned off; Later, l real tzed. to my
utter horror, that my floor was not
the only culprit and that this actu~
ally occurs all over campus!

On this conservation-conscious
campusand in thisenergy-depleted
world of ours, why do we commit
such a ﬂagrant and unnecessary
waste of energy?

THE REAL WORLD

When Mom comes to town

This Saturday, an event of unr
prccodented stature in the history
ofGrinnell College is scheduled to
take place. An event that wtll go
down in the annals ofGrinnell his-
tory; an event that will shake this
college up from the pit of Clever
land to the tower of Gates. The
Real World will meet the Aca-
demic World face to face.

My mother is coming to visit.

Yes, on Saturday. May 4, my
mother is packing her bags into her
blue ‘87 Nova with the Grateful
Dead dancing bears sticker on the
hack bumper and setting off on her
six hour drive down highway 80 in
order to achieve the ultimate sum-
mitofGrinnell College.She has an
oddpcnchantforleavingearly(early
to me being anytime when the sun
is still coming at me from the east)
and will probably end up stopping
in Iowa City or thereabouts to keep
from arriving here too soon. Hav-
ing lived with me for overeighteen
years, she knows by now that on
Saturdays before at least ten I’ll
still be horizontal.

And before anybody asks—
she's not coming to kick any butt
over the fact that she heard that
someone's been calling her (laugh-
ter a loser. That’s more my
grandma’s kind of style. (“You
make IIoublewithmy oldest granda

Laura Moran

child, you make trouble with me!
Face the wrath of Poland!") No.
Mom's just meandering out for a
visit.

So what‘s the point here?

When tlivedathomemymother
and I were not what anyone would
describe as close, unless the phrase
was adjustedtoreferto‘closecom
bat." There was a strong tendency,
particularly in my mid-teenage
years,to yellourselves hoarse mak-
ing pointless points and unneces-
sary character defamations.
(“You’relazyl”“0h.yeah? You‘re
wrongl") Most of these confronta-
tionsended upwithscntiments such
as “I can’t wait unttl you move
out!" which would be closely fol-
lowed by an emphatic “ME T001”

However, i have to admit that
what I never. ever thought would
happen has occurred—I’m 300
miles away, I live in the ideal adult
situation where no one yells at me
for being out late, getting drunk or
not doing all my homework, and
yet I have to admit] find myself
missing my mother.

“Right,” I can practically hear
her saying. “You mean you miss
having someone to do your laun-

dry. You miss having someone to
cook you non-dining hallfood.You
misshaving someone to make your
dentist appointments (and see that
youkeepthem),toremind youwhen
your library books are due. and to
fill out your taxes forms."

And honestly. of course, I do
miss those things I really miss ute
laundry thing each time I look atall
those funkysocksthat resulted from
washing the whites with the tie
dye. And the food.“ well,1’m not
even going to think about the food
side of it all. It just makes Cowles
that much more depressing com-
pared to those full-bellied, painter
pleasin' days of yore.

But there‘s something far more
important that I miss, something
very dimcult to replace—the thing
that even if] learn how to separate
those tricky wash loads with the
skill of a professional laundromat
operator or how to converse flue
ently with even the most recalci-
unnlofdenmlreceptionistsl’llstill
have trouble ﬁnding—that molllcr's
type of unconditional love.

(Ah, the quicksandofsappinessl
Letme flounder fora little bitwith-
out too much eyerrolling; besides,
Mother’s Day is next weekend.
Wouldn'tthis article look nice. para-
