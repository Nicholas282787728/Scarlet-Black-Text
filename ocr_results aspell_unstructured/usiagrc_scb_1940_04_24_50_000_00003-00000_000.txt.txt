the first year, but he can't rec

stniin in quiet enthusiasm over
the prospects after that. If he
had any misgivings when he
took tlic job, they’ve lclt him
completely. Duke said, during
an afternoon visit, that the col-
legc is getting inquiries from
parents and boys all over the
country in a quantity unknown
in years.

Among the visitors on the Grin-
neil campus Saturday was a boy
from St. Louis, Mo, He is a 10»
second man in track and accord-
ing to Wagner, was the best prep
halfback in the Missouri city last
fall. He’s coming to Gi'innell and
here’s whyihe wants to get an
education first and doeSn't think
he can or will get it if he has to
play high pressure football In
other words 119': turning down
"offers” from many big univer—
sities because he has sense enough
to understand that football is just
a part of college lifeinot its ul—
timato aim. Douglas and Wagner
didn't have him at Maplewood,
but they are tickled over the
thought of having him at Grinnell.
It is a wholesome outlook all
around for, as Duke said, while
the college expects to go up in
athletics, it will not lose sight of
the fact that it is an educational
institution first of all.
