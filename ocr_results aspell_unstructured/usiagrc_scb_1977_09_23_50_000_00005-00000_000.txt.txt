Heed deadliness of the “Grinnell Way”

One night last week, while
consuming my daily dose of the
“NBC Nightly News,” I thought I
recognized a figure on the monitor
that glared quietly over David
Brinkley’s shoulder. “Susan,” I
yelled, “My old camp counselor
Jerry I-‘eldmann is on the news.”
Swiftly, I ran to my turntable to
cue the tonearm from the album
that was playing, and then darted
across the room to turn on the
audio portion of the news, all of the
time wondering, “What is Jerry
Feldrnann doing on the news?"
“I mean, there’s no Way he‘d
know Bert Lance. or course, he
may be related to David
Berkowitz." As I turned up Hie
sound I was disappointed to find
that it wasn’t “Crazy Jerry" after
all, but instead was ex-
Weatherperson Mark Rudd. Rudd,
it seems, was turning himself in to
federal authorities at a courthouse
somewhere. “Never mind, Susan,"

I yelled, “it’s only Mark Rudd."

I was heading back to the tum-
table, wondering what did ever
happen to Jerry Feldmann, when l
was passed by Susan who said
lovingly, “If you put that album
back on, I’ll break it!" She then
headed for the television and, for
the second time in God knows how
long, I was subject to David
Brinkley’s voice. David was
recounting the words of Mark
Rudd’s father, who, when asked
why his son had turned himself in,
remarked, “Marks 30. Maybe he
doesn’t Want to be a revolutionary
anymore." If Mr, Rudd is correct
in his assumption, many Grinnell
students should take heed, for their
days are surely numbered. What
concerns me is that when it‘s time
for many Grinnell students to
make the transition to a more
realistic liiestyle, will they be
prepared?

LOOK AT Eldridge Cleaver.

KENT STATE U. There was a
time when those words grabbed as
much response as SEX, Un~
doubtedly, the latter has not been
entirely forgotten by college
students. Neither, rm happy to
report, has the former. In fact,
there are a number of
“movements” in the air at present
to assure that Kent State,
specifically the four students who
were killed by National Guardsi
men in demonstrations there May
4, 1970, will not be forgotten.

At' press time, Jim Stuart and
Rob Heneck had recruited five
Grinnellians and a possible sixth,
who will depart at 2 pm. today, to
take part in a demonstration at
Kent State this weekend. The
rallies will protest the construction
of a gymnasium annex near the
site where the [our students were
shot and nine were wounded seven
years ago during anti-war
demonstrations

SINCE MAY of this year, Ohio
students have been attempting to
stay construction, through protests
and court appeals in order to
preserve the site, in the event that
a future jury decides to examine
the site of the shootings and
possibly reopen the case. Also,
students have been protesting as a
matter of principle, not wanting
the memory of the affair to be
literally swept away.

The May 4 Coalition, a concerned
group of students from colleges
and universities throughout the
nation, but primarily from the Ohio
area, has been organizing most of
the efforts, including the one this
weekend.

0N July 30. approximately 300
students protested 2&3 arrests,
including four ministers, were

made, though many were multiple
arrests. When construction began
Sept. 17 only 25 demonstrators
heckled police. There were,
however, so policemen present
inside the fenced‘ off construction
area, equipped with riot gear.
Optimism and enthusiasm had
Seemed to ﬂicker out as repeated
court appeals to the Supreme
Court have been rejected. The
president of the university claims
Construction cannot be halted
without incurring law Suits from
contractors.

But, this weekend, considerably
more than 300 students are ex—
pected to converge on the Kent
State campus. according to Stuart.
He relates that a large group from
Oberlin College is going and
when everyone arrives, “it could
be emotional. maybe too
emotional." No one, 1 hope, wants
to see a replay.

RENEWED optimism of
achieving a stay has surfaced
amidst speculation that an appeal
by the four Victims' families to
reopen the case may have a chance
of getting through to the us.
Supreme Court. In the initial case,
several guardsmen and the
governor of Ohio were found not
guilty ofmurder. But the court has
“assured" that the possible
reopening of the May a case has
nothing to do with the construction
appeals.

Even if nothing is accomplished
immediately or in the luture,
Stuart says the rally will be ef»
fective “just to show that there is
support for students' efforts. that
we’re not going to sweep the
memory of May 4 under the rug.”
Simply the fact that live from
Grinnell are putting out the time

Once a prominent force in the
radical left, Eldridge has had to
start marketing religion and some
ridiculous style of trouser that he
supposedly invented. With the
religion he'll at least be able to do
talk shows and a revival here and
there. I hope, however, that he
does not have too much of his
personal funds inviated in those
pants he’s trying to sell.

Then, of course, there’s Jerry
Rubin. How prepared do you think
he was to make the transition from
radical to establishment? Did he
actually think a book about his
sexual adventures within the
movement would make him the
darling of the literary set? I
thought for a while he was on the
right track by associating himself
with the “Saturday Night Live"
crowd, considered to he “Les
Enfants Terribles” of the
establishment. While it worked for
Ralph Nader, Ron Nessen, Jillian

and money to go 500 miles in-
dicates minimal support.

BUT alas. the students seem to
be picking a fight with bulldozers,
pounding their heads against a
steel wall, in a tragic waste of
energy. They should be spendng all
men time and energy organizing to
fight the system with its own
weapons: money. They should be
collecting a fund to finance
erection of their own monument.
What could be more memorable
and embarassing than to have
inscribed across the, side of the
gym in five foot tall letters: AT
THIS SITE ON MAY 4. 1970. FOUR
STUDENTS WERE SHOT AND
KILLED FOR PROTESTING
INJUSTICE.

Two good senators have already
initiated efforts, more sensible
ones to sure, along those lines.
Senator Avaresk from South
Dakota is working up a bill to
make “the Hill," the area near the
construction site, a national land-
mark, and he is supported by Iowa
Congressman Ton-l Harken.

THIS is just the beginning of the
school year and the bill is still in its
infancy. There is plenty of time to
stir up support. So let 'em build
their monumental $6 million gym
while we students construct our
own monument of opposition.
However physically small by
comparison, its meaning will be
unmistakably large.

Bond and Gerald Ford, poor Jerry
Rubin stiffed.

PROBABLY the most in-
teresting, and by far the most
successful, change from radical to
establishment was achieved by
Rennie Davis. Rennie now sells
insurance. He has neatly styled
hair, wears conservative suits, and
if “Sixty Minutes” is to be
believed, (a point which could be
debated), he is successful in his
line of work. Rennie has had the
sound judgement and good taste to
keep most of his private life closed
from the press, I bet that he’d
admit that his transition has been a
difficult one.

I have used some rather an
traordinary examples to try to
make one point: If and when the
time comes for you to become a
fullsfledged member of the
establishment, will you be
prepared? Nothing can be more
fulfilling or exciting than to
become involved in a movement or
philosophy. In fact, I’m convinced
that it is something all human
beings must do. However, if while
defending your point of View,
you’ve been shut off from differing
viewpoints, will you be lacking
knowledge that may someday be
useful". Grinnell College attempts
to present a fair representation of
most points of view, but i have
found the misuse of the term
“Grinnell Way” to be a dangerous
weapon when used against diverse
opinion. When wielded by a Small
minority of extremely vocal
students, the “Grinnell Way" can
be deadly.

FOR INSTANCE, when a group
of students attempted to form a
cheerleading squad last year, they
were attacked with a resounding,
“How could you want to lead
cheers? It‘s just not the Grinnell
Way!" As co-chairrnan for the
Students for Ford-Leach last year,
I know all too well what it’s like to
be told by students and faculty
alike, ”Republicans at Grinnell?
You've got to be kidding? That's
just not the Grinnell Way."
Probably, one of the bﬁt examples
of the “Grinnell Way" syndrome
would be this: Last year, a fresh-
man was discussing the now
defunct White Paper with an
alumni. During the conversation
the student told the alumni how he
was actively involved in a student
organization working to reselect
the President, To this the alumni
commented, “That’s all the more
reason why you need a Grinnell
education.”

More than one point of view does
exist at Grinnell, but you might
have to look pretty hard to find
them. Many professors will tell you

when and where Paul Sweezy, the
Marxist economist, or Ed Mez-
vinsky, are speaking. But, if
someone like Phillip Crane, a
conservative, libertarian, and
worthy disciple of Milton Frieds
man, speaks at the college, you'll
have to read your Memo carefully,
or look for a few handwritten
posters, to find out about it. These
examples are not hy’pothetical. All
three of these gentlemen have
Spoken recently at Grinnell,

IT IS interesting to note that
Sweezy, who, if he spoke any
slower would be talking backward,
packed South Lounge to the rafters
with students and faculty from all
disciplines. Yet, when Phil Crane,
a young, energetic member of
Congress spoke, the attendance
amounted to an intimate group of
approximately 50 students and two
facility members. One of the
faculty members was the adviser
of the group sponsoring the talk: It
should be obvrous from the dif~
ferences in the receptions of these
two very different Kind of speakers
that something is wrong.

I think its time that the term
“Grinnell Way" began to en-
compass thc wide spectrum of
beliefs held by the students and
faculty at Grinnell College.
Grinnellians should not only be
willing to accept diverse opinions,
but they should demand an at-
mosphere which encourages the
development and articulation of
such opinions. Such an atmosphere
is essential to expose individuals to
knowledge which may prove useful
in future situations.

AND finally, in the spirit of
diverse opinions at Grinnell, here's
one of mine: This week’s pick for
the “Cross to Bear” Award is none
other than Grinnell’s SGA
President, for his keen insight in
getting himself involved in the
South African investment can
troversy. As the Sol l-lurok of
liberal causes at Grinnell, he has
handled such hit causes as, the
Udall for Presidency campaign,
the Lettuce Boycott, and most
recently, Affirmative Action. Well,
it looks like he’s got another winner
with the South African cause.

The SGA President has been
quoted as saying, “If there is any
issue that will become a major
political issue throughout 'the
college campuses in this country
this fall. it will be this issue." In-
siders report that this may be the
“Big One” for this year’s SGA
leader because last summer he
actually spent some time in
Berkeley, California, the ﬂaming
liberal cause capital of America.

 

Good luck, Jon, next summer try
Pittsburgh.

Movies, bars, concerts, dances .
. or one can even watch a candle
melt with the right chemical
alterations of the mind. These are
only a few of Grinnell's many
weekend entertainments. Yet a
large number of Grinnell students
seem jaded to such activities and
express complete ennuie: “Why
isn’t there anything going on
around here?” . “There’s
nothing to do" .or Simply,”1hatc
lowal," My question to you who
voice such discontent is, is it
Grinnell that is so dullror are you
dull7

vialt, don‘t get insulted. Let me
try to explain. By “dull" I don't
mean stupid or insensitive.
Perhaps I should say “dulled "
Dullcd by the fact that you always
have w'ork to do. Your life is placed
“1 little predetermined slots, You

eat standard food at scheduled
times. Your entire existence is
structured and schedulgd so much
that you attempt to keep un»
structured whatever you can,
which isn't much, or so it seems.
Only your very deepest personal
life, your relationships with
friends, are left entirely up to you.

So, we slack off. Friendships are
supposed to be easy and un-
structured and fun. But for a
friendship to be really fun, exciting
and dynamic, it can't be un~
structured and we can't Slack off
We tend to be irresponsible in our
friendships We allow lllem to
fizzle away when they aren’t
convenient. We don't lake the time
to understand the subtle dynamics
of our relationships, we don't take
the responsibilities of friendship
seriously.

When our various relationships
aren’t given enough time and
thought. they never become in
timate. Such questions as, ”Who
are you in my life?” and “What do
we expect of each otherl" are
avoided by most of us

We just drift in and out of each
other's lives, never taking any
respollslbllity for each other When
we don't commit ourselves. we
don‘t become intimate with
anyone, And intimacy is what
makes tilnes spent with other
people—and olle's selfitulfilling

It‘s hard to channel effort into
friendships when obligations of a
student demand so much and such
rigid effort. But you can't become
lazy with your lr nd , 'ou can't
let that area oi crea ty and
energy wait until you "have time."
