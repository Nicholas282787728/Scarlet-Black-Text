opposed to the individual, on military might
alld “power politics” as opposed to peaceful
cooperaton and “ welfare politics,” is now
ili its flood tide, and no one knows when
the ebb tide will set in.

But we do know that all through history
there have been alternating periods i not
easily defined to be surcfof emphasis on
the state alld on the individual.

Years may go by before a cosmopolitan
atmosphere can again reassert itself. And ill
the meantime, dictatorsliips, power politics,
extree nationalism, wars alld rumors of
wars will be our daily diet.

Spain has been crucified on the altar of
resurgent nationalism. She is the major
“stake of diplomacy” of this period of world
history. .

CONGRATULATIONS, STUDENTS

Ennis or DIPLOMACY

The fates have almost finished spinning
their web, and the Spanish Republic has
entered its fifth and tragic act, The fate
of the Republic was the stake of politics
and diplomacy. The stake has been won by
italy, Germally, certain elements of the
British ruling classes, and of France’s
”Two Hundred."

The Spanish Republic was a “noble ex-
periment” and was fighting for a “lost
cause,” the cause of democracy, internation—
alism, humanitarian enlightenment, popular
education, separation of church and state.
industrial democracy, the things for which
cosmopolitanrminded men and women all
over the world have been fighting so long.

Europe, never free frolu “power politics,”
is now supercharged with the “power polir
tics" of extreme nationalism. Cosmopolitan—
ism has no place in such an atmosphere and
is being driven slowly from the face of the
earth.

The extreme emphasis on the state as

many of us lime just gotten out of the habit
of going.

There are many reasons for this, of
course. The ZOrmillnte period 'i'rom 9 to E) :20
am. every weel: day is all all too-convenient
time to do millly other things besides going
to chapel. For many oil the campus, it has
become breakfast time, tilllc to change
books, time to get to class early and chat
with one’s friends, time to loiter in the
A.R.l{. and spend a last longing minute with
a study ill the libe; ill short, a time for re
laxation bel’ol'c the next three classes of
the morning.

One could hold this justifiable with \‘e 'y
good reason if these were the only 20 ll‘lllir
utcs out of the day to spend, as the biggest
majority of the student body spends them.

Because we are unaccustomed to use the
20 minute perie fl cm 9 to 9 :20 for chapel,
it is an effort for most of us to get there, to
get ill the habit of going. it is hard to think,
however, of a bette ' -lccomplishmcut for the
year than to rcritah e chapel.

We are off to a fall'ly good start. We are
beginning,r to realize rcslllts. The goal, how-
erel‘, is far ahead.

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor of the

SCARLET Sz BLACK:
Dear Mr Rowley:

Your remarks concerning the
attitude of hall councilman found
in the editorial, “Shoot 'Em
Down,” in Saturday’s S.&B was
most apropos, but why limit it to
MEN'S self-government. May we
make similar comments concern-
ing the student leaders in in the
quadrangle ?

oiir quiet hours are not enforc-
ed, there is too much “getting by
where regulations are concerned.
and League Board members fol-
gel! that they sot an example: it
should be a good one'

Tile trouble
mcn are more concerned with
[urtherlllg’ their superficial popllr
larity than with working [or the
good of the women and the
school as a Whole.

A REAL lcudcr does his job in
spite o[ the criticism which is
inevitable for anyone in a re,
Sponsiblc position, and gains for

‘ Of Democracy

——By R.E.M.

Saturday the congress of the
iUnited states o. America culminr
steal a. three-year commemoration
of the founding of the American
government as a democracy, The
ceremonies, marking officially
the 150th year in which congress
had been scssioning, was attend-
ed by more dignitaries of the
United states government than
at any time since the end of the
World War.

In reality, however, the new;
sion marked a group deal more
thiui just the 150th year of
congress It meant the comple-
tion 01 150 ycﬂrs under it deni-
ocrnfic gorcrhmcnt, umlci- o
government which, in spite of
frequent disturbances, largo
and small, has preserved the
traditional institutions of do
mocrncy tor the enjoymci-it of
its people.

True, it has not been perfect in
thc flllfilling‘ of its tasks and
dlltleﬁ, but it has been as success-
ful as rt government run by moi-c
men can be, It has withstood the
test of time for 150 years, which,
although it seems but a short per
riod iii the annals of history, is
quite an epoch when it comprises
the whole life span of a governs
mout,

up are timing in the form of
an or conditions perhaps the
most some test this goi-crh-
niciil has ever (need. Our pres
ent problem is more difficult
lo meet hocousc tho forces
working against us are working
quietly. We haic a sh'zulge
feeling that we are being iiii-
ilei-miiicd. and yet the source
of tho ti-oiililc is hard to put
one’s fiiigci- on. Only lately
has allylhing‘ happened ngainst
which ilic government: can take
notion without violating any of
tho fundamental rights of the
people.

It is indeed fitting that we rc-
consider through just such a cel-
ebration the factors which have
brought us so successfully to this
day. The speeches which marked
the commemoration in congress
were exceedingly worthy of the

‘ outstanding among
them ii i-c those of President
Roosevelt, Speaker Bsnkhead of
the House of Representatives, and
Chief Justice Hughes.

Partly because the president
. had delivered similar addresses
in the post. and partly because
Mr. Hughc l speech was ex—
tremely hri but, the chief jus-
tlco stole the show with his
masterful summary of our 150
years under a democratic sys-
tem.

Onc quotation from his speech,

which brought the stirring joint
session of congress to its feet in
approval, seems to sum up the
thought which he tried to ex—
press: “After 150 years, notwith-
standing expansion of territory,
enormous increase in population
and profound economic changes,
despite direct attack and subver-
sive influences, there is every in-
dication that the vastly prepmr
(lerant sentiment of the ,hmcri-
can people is that our form of
government shall be preserved."
An occasionnl gathering sllh
us this, ﬁlled with ceremony
and the right kind of patriot-
ism, is good for our country,
as c means of renewing “that
vastly prcponilcront sentiment."
We need a continual emphasis
on the true type of patriotism
which such occasions arouse.
