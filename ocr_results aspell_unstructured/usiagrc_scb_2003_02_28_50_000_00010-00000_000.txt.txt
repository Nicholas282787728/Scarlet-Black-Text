have much money, so you’ll just buy the basics, but
ouide how do you decide where to go.>Which
of Gtinnell’sﬁw stores do you choose to pa.
tronizg? Using some ofrhe other kind of pa.
tronizing we reviewed Grinneil grocery stores.
We gave a 1 10 rating in four categories: at.
mosphcre customerservice, selection untest-
drive (Elisa measuta style and distance traveled
following a rather wimpy Push; Jen tests ma.
neuverabiliry by doing threepoint trims). we
also performed a Frveltem Frenzy to test logis-
tics and pricing: we searched for salsa, tortilla
chips, a 12—pack of beer, a two—liter Mountain
Dew, and Altoids, adding up the oosr and time
required at each store.

J u Iie’s
Atmosphere

Jen: Sugar Ray was playing on the radio. but
use music was at a good volume and there were no
loudspeakers to disrupt the songs, it had that
wholesome healthrfoocl-smrc smell (no, 1 don’t
know what that smell is), and nice natural light
poured in thc windows. And it was really, really
clean. Like, really clean 9/10 ~

Elisa: The gospel—chorred rock music made me
want to march and demand organic Justice. I'd like
to live here, but the wallpapered borders were odd.—
minimalist apartment meets Midwestern hair salon.
Subtract a point for the semi trucks zooming past
the front windows. 9/10
Customer Service

J: A friendly employee immcdiatdy asked ifshe could
help us. Then she left us alone to shop. My favorite kind of
employee! 10/10

E: Yo, but there’s iust got to be something fabriiared
in all that wholesome goodness. High fructose corn Syrup?

soy than you ran shake a stick at! The monthly special
involved two pounds otorganie bananas free with the pur»
chase of$7 oforganic produce. Who doesn‘t want organic
bananas.> However, it's probably not where you’d run to
pick up quick party supplies unless you’re really Compul»

E: Julie’s selection includes a set of those swinging,
Western-saloon wooden doois, I could almost picture Paul

Fareway
Atmosphere

J: Faraway reminds me of home. Trust me, it’s very
lowz. It smells like chicken and has a very peaceful feel to
it. However, 1 was a bit suspicious that a shady looking
man in a puffy Brewers coat might be following Elisa and
l around. as he appeared to be doing as little actual shopv
ping as we wcrc Fareway had more cute old people than
Hy.vce and WaI-Matt, in fact, l’d estimate that at least
80% ofthc customers were over 60. It was a pumd: of old
people! It's a little dirty... so what? 9/10

E», Even though there was no music, it feltlikc a roller
skating ring, The fluorescent lights and the columns were
all really thin, perfect for zooming tindcr and spinning

notice anything else lacking. 3/10

E: I select Farcway's “the nut department" sign as the
best I've seen in any grocery store. And I think I should
selcer this spot as my next h.angout Eareway accepts all
kinds. 8/10
Cart Test Drive

J: Little car carts were an allmcuve option, but Elisa
and I probably would have fough_i over who got to drive.

J: McNaiiy‘s certainly has an extensive liquor selection,
not to mention a prominent display oieheap wine. The
bargain 42!! contained notrquitﬁtomplete six packs oibeer

E: Note that McNally’s has selected to install tricky

very industrial look, with beams showing

E: Ignore the noxious renovation fumes
and scary dangling wires and maybe you get
warehouse chic. I felt likeI was helpingseteup

Nor at all chic. though the aisles were big
enough for dancing. 5/ 10

Cm Test-Drive
J: “Customer in Training" (”Consumer in Training!"

baskets. Wide aisles made the threerpolnl turn a cinch.

Wal-Mart
Atmosphere

J: I am a consumer. I confess. I find wai.Mart incred-
ibly soothing and have been known to go walk the islcs

Selection

J: They might have everything else you need, but ditir

And one thing they ncver lack is Diet Mountain Dew. 3/
