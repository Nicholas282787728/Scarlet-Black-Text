Parents ~ you can‘t live with them, and you wouldn’t be here without
them.

Yes, another Parents’ Weekend is scheduled to occur at Grinnell. By
the time you read this they will have already started to arrive. In case
you have any trouble recognizing them, they will be the ones wearing
name tags (you remember, just like New Student Days).

They may show up in some of your classes, you‘re bound to see some
at the movies and you sure won‘t be able to miss them when they go
through tray breakdown in the dining halls. Yep, one fact rings clear ~
you can feel their presence on campus.

Now all of this is making our parents out to sound like a rather
undesirable group. Well, that may or may not be the case; you have to
decide for yourself.

The natural question arises as to why they have come. First off, they
were invited. The Office of Development and Alumni Programs invites
the parents here so that they can see what college is like when classes
are in session. Second, Parents’ Weekend gives all the parents a chance
to have conferences with their kids teachers, if they choose.

In addition to the possible conferences, there is also a whole long
schedule of events that are planned for this specific weekend so that
there is plenty for mom and day to do and so that they have a further op-
portunity to see what Grinnell is really like.

We guess that‘s where we find fault with the whole concept of Parents’
Weekend. Mom and dad are not getting a chance to see what Grinnell is
really like and the reason is just because they have chosen to come. The
point is that when the parents arrive at Grinnell it immediately changes
the atmosphere.

Many students don’t act the way they normally do when parents are
around and we can understand that. It’s kind of hard to let yourself go
crazy in the Pub when you know that parental eyes are looking at you
thinking that you have already had too much beer.

So listen mom and dad, it really is nice to have you come for a visit.
You deserve the chance to see what kind of an education all that money
is paying for. But don t come here thinking that you are seeing the real
Grinnell. You are seeing Grinnell on Parents Weekend and that’s a very
different Grinnell from every other weekend of the year

The divestment questio

Corporate involvement is b

As sure as school starts in the tall, the
Grinnell college South African Support
Group toc S.A,S on calls ior Grinnell to
divest its holdings in 13 companies that do
business in South Africa. Their

argument runs something like this: liv

enough shareholders pull their investments
irom us companies doing business in
South Africa, those companies will get the
message and leave South Africa, whose
government will then tall and apartheid
will end. A naive if not simplistic theory
The idea that US investment in South
Africa is the mainstay oi the South Afican
government is wrong, The total US. capital

investment in South Africa is approximate!

ly $17 billion, which is roughly 17 percentoi
the total foreign investment in that nation
This is miniscule compared to the invest-
ment of the European Community which is
54 percent oi total ioreign investment. Fur-
uiermore, us. investments are only tour
percent oi total capital investment in South
Africa,

South African Finance Minister Owen
Horwood has stated that South Airica will
not "be forced to its knees" ii us, comr
panies divest their capital Even iormor
Senator Dick Clark's total Foreign Reta»
lions Subcommittee on Africa conceded
that U.S. economic interests in South
Africa "may not be decisive" after all,

The South Airican government as well as
independent analysis have concluded that

the hall 01 U S, capital would slow the co i
try's growth rate below the level necessa
to accommodate the three percent bi
rate in the non-white population. Sou
African blacks would then face the p
spect oi unemployment without welfa
checks and iood stamps.

The South African government will not
hurt by US. divestiture but those depe
dent upon the us corporations certain
will be Unemployment would certainly
a problem but most of those who lost ﬂi-
Americansupplied jobs would iind wo
with lhe .lapanesc and European corpor
tions that would pick up right where t
Americans left off. Freddy Sauls, a bla
union organizer in Port Elizabeth said,
Fortune, "Most of the American firms n
are pretty good, certainly a hell oi a lot b
ter than the British firms," Polaroid \t
applauded when, in 1977, it terminated i
franchise agreement to sell the Son
African government the photograph
equipment needed to make the hat-
passbooks. The passbooks are still m'.
and whatever humanizing eiiect Polaro
had on its employees ceased with the cm
pany's departure

Those who call for U S. corporate dive:
ment in South Africa have to realize that
are talking about individuals and not jus|
vague abstract notion of righl and wron
U S corporations employ 90,000 So ’
Atricans, including 60,000 blacks. Sa

Trustees should hear all opi

In the most recent issue of Grinnell
Magazrne, George Drake revives the ques
tion oi the college's possible divestment oi
stocks from corporations which have
operations in South Airica by soliciting sug-
gestions and comments on this important
South African question. Drake's letter was
written in response to a request irom the
Board of Trustees to get feedback on the
issue oi divestment from as many constir
tuencies as possible and particularly irom
those constituencies which have up to now
had the least opportunity to voice their opi-
nions, primarily alumni

The timing of Drake's letter was not ran
dam. The Board of Trustees intends to
discuss and possibly resolve the issue of
divestment when it meets Oct 31 The
Board wishes to have as much information
as possible from as many sources as posts
ble before arriving at a decision,

Proponents of divestment argue that our
investments in South Africa are a moral
disgrace to the college and ought to be sold,
in part for the sake oi our own consciences
and in part in hopes oi making a strong
enough social statement to encourage other
institutions to divest, thereby forcing the
multinational corporations to drastically
change their policies in the country or to

Chandlebaum's

leave South Africa altogether. The most

common opposition to this argument is that

divestment would mean throwmg away our

only opportunity to influence south African

policy by relinquishing our power oi proxy_
Votes,

In the end, there are two fundamental
disagreements which separate the op.
ponents and proponents of divestment, Op»‘
ponents feel that divestment would hurt the‘
college iinancially, while proponean oi
divestment do not accept a financial loss as
an inevitable or even significant conse-
quence oi divestment, The second disagree-‘
ment involves the role 01‘ multinational cor,
porations. Pro~divestment circles see
multinational corporation as being
necessary to the maintenance of the racist
regime in South Africa while those against
divestment feel that the multinational cor-,
porations are much more ethical than the
local governments and businesses and look
to the multinational as the only real hope
for change

The refutatiuns oi the main arguments oi.
both sides 01' the divestment coin become
very interesting when compared side-by-
side. Anti-divestment interests claim that
divestment is an essentially meaningless
gesture because we can never expect our
