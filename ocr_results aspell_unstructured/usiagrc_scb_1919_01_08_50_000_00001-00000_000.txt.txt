the annual ring tossing clashes be
tween the four classes will be played
oit this week commencing this alter
noon at 4:00 o'clock.

The ﬁrst two games oi the series
will be played this alternoou. Thc
Seniors will take on the Sophomores
while the JulliOl's,liicct the Freshmen.
The next two games will be played on
Friday afternoon. when the Seniors
meet the Juniors and the Sophomores
battle the Freshman. The ﬁnal games
of the series take place Saturday after-
noon. The Seniors play the Fresllr
men and the Juniors play the Sopho-
morcs.

Soni. Fees Unnecessary.

Each team will meet each of the
other teams once during the series.
In case or a tie for ﬁrst honors the
deciding game will he played next
Week at a time to be decided later.

No admission will be charged to the
games of the class series this year,
making the usual semester fee un-
necessary.

From all dope which is on hand con.
cerning the merits or the respective
teams, it appears that the two teams
which will battle tor ﬁrst place in the
series will he the Seniors and Sopho-
mores. The Seniors have all the last
year's men back, three or whom were
on the varsity squad of last winter.
In addition, to the last year men they
have Ccttys who has been putting up
an unusually strong game at center,
and also hitting the ring with regu-
larity. stock and Sauermau will cover
the forward positions with Turner and
v. Dauhcnbcrger at the other end or
the floor. Calcson has also been get-
ting out and may be counted on to
show a good brand of basketball at
either a forward or a guard position.

Juniors’ Lineup Uncertain.

The lineup of the'Jiiniors is still in
doubt, since practically all oi the men
at the third-year squad or last year
are still in the service. H. Daubenr
bergcr, Swinchart. and Isaacson have
been out daily for practice, and will
undoubtedly tot-m the nucleus of this
year's Junior tcam. Bob Lee who
played on the 1919 team last year will
probably play with the 1920 aggrega.
