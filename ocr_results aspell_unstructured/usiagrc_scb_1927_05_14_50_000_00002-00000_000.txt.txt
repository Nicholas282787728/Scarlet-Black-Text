DISBAND THE BAND!

Gi-innell college, students and tnculty, pride thenlr
selves on their appreciation of music. They will assure
you that every one is interested, every one
turns out far concerts i and recitals. \Vhicli
appears to be a halfrtruth. Half-truths are not, strictly
speaking, a Grinnell specialty, but certainly the attitude
that we have had toward our college hand has been dlSr
couraging, to say the least. Since we have deserted it,
there is only one way left to it to take to disappear [Tom
Grinnell as an organization.

one- of the prime promoters or college spirit is a
hand There is nothing so qualified to raise enthusiasm
to high levels, To it a group will respond whoierhednr
edly. it stirs the heart with the feet; it enlivens a. game,
challenges an enemy, expresses contempt, is the living
force behind a student body. A school without a snappy,
energetic band is lowered to the last ranks in the eyes
of outsiders. When you find a dejected, lacks rdalslcal
little group of men playingr half-heartediy on :t few in~

strllments, then will you tiud a school in which coonerdr '

tion, interest, activity fall the attributes of it live coi-

They were glad to play; they knew that most of their
audience were there because they wanted to hear what
the band had to offer. But would that hand have hecome
as line and its ranious as it has without the enthusiastic
cooperation oi its school? An actor cannot play to an
unsympathetic audience“; a football team does not win
easily without its hack-ground of a yelling, righting mass
of human heings, fellow students. Can We expect a hand
to contrihute its efforts toward lame for the school it the

When )ou go to the first
game ol’ the season next year, what will you do without
your hand? Who will start the songs? Vl'ho will put
the fight into your soul? Who will do more than any
thing else to tell that team that you're with it? There is
only one answer. We can't afford to let our hand go:
just because we are too busy to support it, We are not
asked the impossible when we are risked to attend a conr‘
cert or contribute a small amount toward new music. It
will be to our everlasting shame if we let this thing have
pen. Let's show a little of that Grinnell spirit we hear
so much about!

No one doubts the classic beauty of thc smoke stock
We can appreciate its severely classic lines as well as,
any one. We can see the loveliness ut the swirling!
masses of black smoke issuing _frcm this slender shatt‘
and standing clear against the hluc-white of or spring air}
tcrnoou. But we cannot appreciate the heaw blanket‘
of black soot that settles promptly down on our campus.
We do not like our rees shrouded in hlac - we do not
care to have our noses fcstooned with soot; \\'e have,
no delight in filling our lungs with excess coal! Some»
thing ought to be done about it. There are such things as ‘
smoke rthsorhers. Can’t we save our pure surroundings
from this profanity of smoke. \Ve have nothing to hide.

Next thing we know, the maprmakers will be marking
Grinneli down as “possessing a large volcano, orgirr uur
known. it erupts volumes of black smoke daily. A most
interesting phenomenon," l
