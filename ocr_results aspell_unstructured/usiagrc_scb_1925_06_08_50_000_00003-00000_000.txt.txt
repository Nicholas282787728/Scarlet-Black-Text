THE GREAT GATSB
gel'i—lkL Charles Scllbller's sous.

Without a doubt. one or the worst
novels or the year is “The Great cuts—
by” by F. Scott Fitzgerald. That state~
nient is hasty, but it is the conclusion
collie to alter no hasty generalization.
From the very beginning 0[ the novel
one wonders just what F. Scott is Ll)"

. ing to develop in his characters.
Whether he intends to make them
puppets in a gay and hlase world, or
whether they are the Cl‘ezttmnsiof a
too ianciiul mind, the reader cannot

a ascertain aiter the hook is tinished.
Undoubtedly, Mr. Fitzgerald is sincere
in his attempt to prove the sordidness
and inorhidness of society on Long Is-
land; but he fails to accomplish that.
because he has not the cleverness and
technique to properly develop his de—
pictiou.

To be more brief and less adierse,
"The Great Gatsby," as a novel, is

‘ made to more too swittly. The chars
otters gallop iroin scene to scene and
train situation to situation at a rate
that would make H. G. Wells' "Tinie
Machine" more at a snail's pace beside
them

The story starts when a young man,
‘\vhose name in the hook is —, moves
to Long Island, or West Egg, to be
more exact, and settles there (or the
summer to study. Near the house he
takes tor the summer is the mansion
