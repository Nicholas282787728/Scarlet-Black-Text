Beatty Explains
New Cut Policy
Recently Adopted l

A notice to all men of Grinnell
college concerning the fact that no
class absences are to be carried
over from one semester to another,
was sent by Dean Shelton L. Beatty
Tuesday.

Formerly onehalr of the student‘s
absences were carried over to count
on the total tor the next semester.
with a one-hour's credit penalty for
incurring 18 cuts during a semester.
The penalty is still in effect, accord-
ing to the notice.

First notice of the change, accord
ing to Dean Beatty, was printed in
the student directory issued last
semester. Dean Bectty also reminds
students that each absence counts
full weight unless for illness of three
days or more, or {or approved activ-
ity, as stated in the directory.

“No student will ever be permitted
to lose an hour's credit solely because

 

of illness or approved activity aha
sellces, or for a combination of solely
absences ior illness and for approved
activities," the notice states.
