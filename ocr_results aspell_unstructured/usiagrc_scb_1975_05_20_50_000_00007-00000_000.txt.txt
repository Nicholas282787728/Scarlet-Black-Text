Death of

draw a moral lrom the whole air

it was simply the end oi the
Communications Department at
Grinnell. I guess a hard-core
English major could come up with‘
some heavy symbolism, but it was
so anti-climactic at the end.

, Two years ago, the college
declared the end at the Com-
munications Department. At that
time there was an uproar, an
outrage, a fight to save the
department irom extinction. But,
like most student movements, it
was doomed to iailure. Despite the
speeches, the mass meetings, and
the maneuverings, it was too late.
So the department was to he ended.

But all was not lost, Instead oi a

a major

apparent. There was no room at
the college for a communications
study oi any sort. So the ins
terdiscipliiiary study went the way
of the communications major And
then there were none.

So the college ended the
program. And all was right
because there was no taint of
professionalism to sully the liberal
arts reputation. And the com-
munications majors became the
dinosaurs of Grinnell. Reduced in
number to three by this year. they
smiled and accepted the fact.

But It is not the End of the
Communications Department that
Grinnellians should concern
themselves with. but the end of
communications. Simply killing a
depai-tmcnt should not signal the
end ni campus interchange, but to
a certain degree, it has, The
Dean’s Open Forum is a thing of
the past The iaculty criticizes the
student evaluatlolls at the slightest
chance. The student voice on
iaculty positions is reduced to a
minimum Grinnell, which for
years has prided itseli on the tree
interplay oi ideas has once again
been separated into two camps~
the students versus the ad-
ministration. Where once the
opportunity ior interchange oi
ideas and student input eXisted, the
circuit now is closed.

So do not mourn the end oi a
department. Departments at
Grinnell come and go, as thc
sociology major may soon iind out,
but instead mourn the loss of open
communication. We may read the
official announcements in the
Campus Memo and read the digest
oi the Week in the 5&3, but the
Chance for [ace-to-face cons
irontation is rapidly slipping away.
It is easy for the ofﬁcials to become
insulated from the students. It is
much more difficult to maintain an
open line of communication. Let us
hope Grinnell can do so.

An
mbivalent1
romantic

by Man Jones

For several years ihave been asked to write a short essay ior this
special issue of thes a B. I'm not sure why; perhaps what is wanted is
an historians record oi the year and or a class, or an aging romantic’s
memorial to the mystery oi commencement, a nostalgic period piece
looking back to other commencements in other Mays

In the past these essays have not been hard to write, but this year 1
iind it diiiicult to say anything particularly appropriate. There are too
many seniors I don’t know; there is no iinal advice to give, the year
and the month oi May has been strangely uneventiul although the war
in Vietnam and Cambodia is finally over and Nixon is iinaliy gone.
Vietnam, Cambodia and Nixon have served in the past as symptoms
oiour discontent, occasions ior demonstrations in May, parameters or

the Commencement season. They are gone, although the ilurry oi
Ford’s Cambodia bombing last week recalled old times in a ritualistic

style.

Dramatic external and internal political events provided the Context
ior recent commencements, and raised larger questions or the
College’s relationship to the world, knowledge’s relation to power, the
student’s relationship to the world, knowledge’s relation to power, the
student's relation to society and to the future. And Grinnell expressed
itself quite clearly on these matters in the late 1960's and early muss
establishing or reiniorcing an image, acquiring or maintaining a sense
oi identity and community. Although the external and internal
political stimulus has gone, the large questions remain And no
response to them is apparent this spring,

It is a drilting, uncertain season, a time of ambivalence. Other
colleges in other places in the midltm's have made their peace with
the world and have supposedly thnessed a new (or old) careerism, a
new (or old) anxiety about grades and graduate schools. new (or old)
rigidity about requirements and methodologies, Some oi that has been
present at Grinneil this year, although not particularly among the
grdauates oi 1975, They are a transitional class, close enough to the
1960’s to be skeptical of the world, distant enough from the 1960‘s to
believe that the world is going to change very much. Perhaps one
should say cynical instead oi skeptical; i have talked to more self-
contessed cynics this year than in a long time, Conversations with
seniors have also conveyed a more intense dismay about the future
than before, a dismay reﬂected in greater hestitation about (301117
mitting themselves to law schools or graduate schools, or the
Woodrow Wilson School, the Kennedy School, or the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Affairs. One understands the hesitation, the
tendency to detachment rather than commitment, the skepticism if
not the cynicism, Asigniiicant symptom of this mood is the aim oi one
group oi seniors to set up a type oi “Halfway house" in Minneapolis, a
temporary way station tram Grinnell to the world.

What does one make of all dais, and what meaning does it have for
the College? Do we prepare students (or detachment or commitment,
do we produce eynics or bureaucrats, do we reinforce moods about the
luture that make old people oi twenty-one year aids?

The College drilts ambivalently before these questions in a time of
trouble and transition. With a diminished image of itself as a com-
munity with a purpose, the institution has also been groping this year
with is own problems of identity, its own anxieties about the future.
We can be glad that President Turner in hi Inaugural Address faced
these problems directly. In his commitment to make education at
Grinnell a more “joyful process" and in his aim to make education at
Grinnell creative of that “ﬂexibility of spi tneeded in today’s world"
he otters alternatives to drill and cynicism, alternatives that may
better prepare iuture graduates ior their encounterwith the world.

lam enough of a romantic still to believe that the graduating seniors
oi 1975 have already experienced at Grinnell a quality oi joy and a
spirit of ﬂexibility that will help sustain them in other places at other
times.

Graduation

Congratulations, senior,
On your graduation day,

It is not iust an ending
But a starting so they say.

Commencement means hegi ning,
You are ready now to start

With a knowledge that will help you
Plus your willing hands and heart!
