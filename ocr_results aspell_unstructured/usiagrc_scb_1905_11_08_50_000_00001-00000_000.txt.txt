inagnanimous spirit which some or
alumni display towards the editor.
Both gentlemen really meet the editor
every day and y et neither one took the
trouble to critic him to his iace,
but prelcrred to write arival publica-
tion. The exigency or the case did not
demand their prompt service as it was
purelyamlllziir betweenthe two papers
which in no way involved the athletic
relations or the institutions as the
writers try to make out. It is Simply
apnre case or knocking and oi the
worst type at that. One cithe gentler

“Editor of the Daily Iowan, Iowa
City, Iowan—near S 1': An article
appeared in "Scarlet and Black” in
the issues of October 25th, under the
caption, “The State Championship,"
Which was as OlIensii'e t0 Grinnell
readers as it. must have been to such
students and graduates of the Univer-
sity as saw it. 1 wish to say, as a
graduate or Griilnell college, that the
senbln‘leuts therein expressed and the
references therein made to the root-
ball teams or the University, past and

presenb, do not in any way coincide

by the irresistible attack which Iowa
had made on the scarlet and black line
and you that same team fought to
the last ditch and never once yielded
a point until it was overpowered and
ricrn out. Beaten under such circum-
stances is no disgrace.

The Iowa team surprised their own
followers as much as chey did Grinnellt
They played with a ﬁerceuess and
with a machine-like rapidity than has
never been displayed by any Iowa
team in recent years. Their interfer-
ence was magniﬁcent? The execution
or their plays could hardly have been
improved. Coach Chalmers had his
men trained to the very point and they
displayed a knowledge of football
which would have done credit to the

was unable to gain so captain Aura-

was gone. Iowa repeated the same
tactics and made another touchdown

THE PIANO RECITAL.

Throughout the whole ola program
whose [lemunds upon Lilo player were
no slight ones, illiss Shutts played
witha simplicity untl ease and cor-
rectness which aroused the enthusiasm
and admllimion OI her audience. iIer
playing was all clear cut and ﬁrm and
Lhere was none 01' the Slip shod hands

inent or involved passages so common
to amateurs but every note sounded
Lrlle rind clear.

The program wasadelightiul one,
Well calculated to interest her lisbeue
ers. Perhaps the most pleasing court.
was her almost technically faultless
rendition of the second Nocturne.
This old universal {avarice had an
added beauty given it by Miss Shubb’s
Sensible interpretation. It Was a. sane
rendition enl‘iirely lacking in the rabid-
er morbid sentiment Which issome~
times attached to it. It perhaps
lacked 3 lim/le of the depbh of feeling
which has sometimes been given it»
here.

The Brassin branscripoion of “Mag-
i0 Fire” from "Die Walkiil’e” was
about the same as most Wagnei-ian
transcriptions only more so. As a

produce bhe spirit oftlle operatlcscore

interpretation 0 that (to least, Miss
Sliutts can be on on the credit or orig-

was of course the beautiful Saint
