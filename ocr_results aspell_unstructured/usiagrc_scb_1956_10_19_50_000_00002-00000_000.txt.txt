/ Student Council Acts

The Student Council’s request last night for informs-
tipn concerning student funds is commendable. It shows an
aware spirit, which is badly needed on campus,

It is difficult to carry on an effective program when
organizations have not received their allotment from the
semester fee funds. It is unbelievable that students can-
not find out how many fee-paying students are attending
Grinnell this semester.

It seems that there is an undue delay in receiving this
feel When there is a lack of communication between the
controller of the college and the student auditor, the stus
dents have no way of understanding this delay. If there
is an explanation, it should be made. Perhaps it will be made
next Thursday night. We hope so.

We have wondered why the SKcB has received only
two letters to the editor this year, with only one of them
dealing with a current campus affair. We thought the pre-
vailing bewildered spirit was only idle talk. But now the
council has made a strong appeal for clarification on behalf
of the student body. We congratulate them for their col-r

crete demonstration of campus leadership, _

Political activity in the nae
tion’s capital continues to inc
crease, with the First Tuesday
After the First Monday in N04
vember drawing ever closer,
Highlighting this week’s shenan-
igans was the “non partisan”
Ike Day celebration at the Hotel
Statler, Somehow the GOP
overlooked similar non-partisan
affairs in the preceding three
years, but for some reason
have decided that this is the
year to do it up brown.

One of your roving report-
ers gained entrance to the
soircc with the aid of a
faked Young Republicans
card, it also being a “Youth
Salutes Ike" aifair, he was
shocked at the number of
holding heads in the area,

One of the more staunch ad~
herents of the newlvroricntated
Party of the People was heard
to remark that “the crowd
getting so rowdy, rd swear it
“as a Democratic rally." Your
faithful reporter. having broaclp
ed Mr. Eagerly 0n the Subject
of presenting the President with
a gift on behalf of the Young
Democrats of America, was told
(in a non—partisan way) that
"the President isn’t going to be
here tonight, and how the - -
did you get in here anyway?“

On the other side of the fence,
the Young Democrats of the
D.C. area had proceeded some
few days earlier to hold one
of their more vociferous demon-
strations in front of the GOP
headquarters. They were doing
this with the aid of the latest
party gimmick, plastic inflated
donkeys.

The Republicans, in their
resourceful way, were not
slow in producing cigarettes
and pen knives, and proceded
to make short work ot the
donkeys. Undaunted however,
the YD‘s held a torchlight
parade Monday night through
the streets of the Capital.

The week in Washington was
also marked by a new series of
investigations and hearings on
Capitol Hill. Perhaps the most
noteworthy was that of the
Senate Subcommittee on Privi—
leges and Elections. The ore—
matis personae consisted of Sen-
ators Gore (D. Tenn), Manse
field (D. Mon.) and Curtis (R.
Neb.) The main witnesses were
National Committee Chairmen
Butler and Hall. Walter Reuther

and Assistant Attorney General
Olney.

Your writers attended a few
of these hearings and were
much impressed by the dilir
gence with which Senator Gore
watched the clock so as to be
sure to adjourn in time for the
World Series.

. sparks flow at one point
between Senator Curtis and
Mr. author, but the hearings
were well worthwhile a v-
way, as they provided in ‘ght
into the mammoth sums of
money being poured on the
American public every four
years.

with but a few days left un-
til the clcction, for the next
two weeks we will entertain
you with our political prognas~
tications as to the outcome, but
remembering the fate of the
Literary Digest picking Landon
by a landslide in ’36, we re-
serve the right to hedge.

Whether you have the old-
grad attitude that Blair hall is
the embodiment of all that is
lgood and fine and American. or
whether you look on it as ml
ugly imitation of an old and
ugly type of architecture, the
following story should be oil

1
some interest to you. i
l

When I first came to Grinnell,
the story was that Blair halil
which once housed Grinncll's‘
science division, was condemned
and would be torn down, but
that the cost of wrecking it was

so high that the job couldn't be
done in the near future.

As time went on, the heat. 1
ing system was partially torn
out for some reason, possibly
because the pipe was still us.

 

able. With no heat in the
building, walls began to crack,
structural joints separated and
weather did the rest. Great
numbers of pigeons and bats
round their way into the buil»
dirﬁ; and proceededito estab-
ﬁsh a hen-house atmosphere.

At this point, when Blair had
reached a low ebb in the proc-
ess of decay, it was decided
that the bookstore (located for
more than 20 years in the base-
ment of the library) was in an
undesirable place—the entrance
wasn’t handy for students, and
the library needed extra storage
space. There was some talk of
constructing a temporary build
ing for the bookstore, but this
was decided against, and the
bookstore was moved to Blair.

The magnitude of this project
cannot be imagined by anyone
who did not see it in progress,
and did not see the “before"
and "after." It was found nec-
essary to replace the heating
system for the first floor, make
major structural changes in
walls and doorways, install new
lighting and do a complete paint
job, inside and out. At the pres-‘
ent time, brick work and con—
crete work is being repaired—
another major project in itself.

I have heard the opinion
expressed that the cost of the
project could have easily cov-
ered the cost of a temporary
building, with enough left
over to get a gond‘stiu't on
tearing Blair down

My contention is, of course,
that the whole job was a gi—
gantic mistake — Grinnell cola
lege is now the not-sosproud
owner of an old, old building,
oncercondemned, with the first
floor very nicely renovated, and
with the second and third floors

about to fall down on top of it.

The Blair story especially
stands as a monument of poor
planning now that the library
is to be renovated, with plans
for major architectural additions
to the campus—less than six
months after the bookstore was
moved,

Perhaps all this has the fin-
vor of kicking a sleeping dog
that should best be left to lie
_.the Blair mistake is one
that can’t be undone until the
building is torn down. But I
think it can scrvc as a classic
example of the errors that

I hope that in the new plans
for the dream campus, Blair
will be removed. The work
