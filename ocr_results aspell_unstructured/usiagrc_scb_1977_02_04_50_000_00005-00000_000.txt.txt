[supposedly gave up my claim to
the Bachelor of Evasive Action
degree, as described by Mark
Anderson in these pages last week.
two years ago. Yet every semester
and especially for the past three
months now, since November pre-
registration, I have contemplated
one more fancy flight, one more

’mester off.

In December I made
arrangements for the option of a
personal leave, and even after five

1 eks of break, of reading novels,
looking waffles, and long walks on
the frozen creek beds of Iowa I
have doubts.

Should I take one more semester
off I could Step in line next fall for
Chemistry 129 and Greek. Then I
could flex my wits for awhilE,
something I've missed since
returning here to where the roof is
always overhead and the meal is
always on the table. [could rest my
eyes and become hungry again for
books, I could figure out where I
want to go.

I would miss the May march

I remember once when l was

out nine I took a fit to playing
with dolls, And I played dolls with
my older sister‘s outgrown friend.
She in turn had a little sister,

ch younger than 1. Betty Lou
was about six, l think, and I
remember that at lunch this day
she had been sent to her room for
disobeying some parental order.

 

Her sister Marie and I went on to
play with the dolls while Betty Lou
sobbed, and pounded the pillow and

kicked the bed on which she lay in
the next room and cried out
mournfully, ”Why me?" I think
this was the first time I understood
that someone other than myself
might ask such a question.

“You cannot really know what it
is like," a senior pointed out to me
last year. I am inclined to agree
with her now. And professors. or
any of those who are already sure
of where they will be this June or
September, cannot really know
what it is like.

I don‘t expect to get any less
teary-eyed in the months to come.
Or is it only days, as Sherman
Boone has begun to remind us? I
amscared. I need fifteen credits. it
might as well be fifty. I am here
this semesterand I callnot miss the
ceremony because I am here.

The other afternoon I caught
myself in front of Mears where I
lived freshman year. “Why," I
asked, “if only a few days ago you
were convinced that the ceremony
didn‘t matter, why now are you
afraid to miss it?”

Could my reasoning then have
been something like Betty Lou's
question? More sophisticated, but
of the same timeless, ageless,
eternal rhythm. so simply sour-
grapes?

I take comfort these days in the
memory of seniors I have known in
other years who performed superr
human deeds under greater
weights than I carry with me now.
It is a test, isn’t it, of our nerves,
and guts and strength?

Jarrett lives

Q

“Shades“—Keith Jarrett.
Produced by Esmond Edwards,

yright one for ABC-Impulse

For the jazz listener, “Shades“
represents some of the most en-
joyable work that Keith Jarrett,
pianist, and his usual clan of
musicians (Dewey Redman on
tenor sax, Charlie Haden, bass;
Paul Motian, drums and
Guilherme Franco, percussion)
have produced. Though lacking the
loose, flowing, pleasantly lazy
flavor of Jarrett’s group‘s previous
re ase, “Mysteries," this album
' iores and expands some
traditional realms of jazz while the
creativity of Jarrett and company

rges Omnipotent as ever,

Side _0ne starts off with a mild
surprise—an upctempo cut,
complete with four-inca-bar beat,
walking bass, and rather disjunct
Jarrett improvisations, entitled
"Shades of Jazz." The reference to
the swing era is evident here, and
the cut swings and holds together,
rhythmically and otherwise. This
leads perfectly into “Southern
Smiles,” a simple, Latin sounding
riff expounded by, most
noticeably, Jarrett (who in places

12..

 

is reminiscent of Chick Corea‘s
best moments) and Dewey Reds
man (usiilg the medium 4-4 tempo
to create some beautifully
technical sounds).

Side two begins with “Rose
Petals,” a beautiful, flowing blend
of piano textures, wailing sax, and
the urging. implied rhythm that
the Jarrett group has mastered so
well,

Another high point here is the
interesting, effective use of various
types of percussion. “Diatribe,”
which follows, resembles “Rose
Petals” rhythmically but not
melodically;a Latin, primitive
essence is apparent, and once
again, the application of various
percussion puts on the final
touches.

The recording quality on this
album is quite good. This release
combines the innovation and
percussive effects of Jarrett‘s
album “Birth," the flowing, im~
plied rhythms of “Mysteries” and
some ideas from more traditional
idioms to createa fine bit of work.
They are just exactly the tunes to
be hearing at a muted level while
attacking the hooks.

Profiles in garbage

I received this letter in my box
the other day (after it had gone to
the boxes of some of the three or
four other Mark Andersons who
chose THIS college THIS year. I
don’t know why they couldn‘t have
waited until I left):

Dear Mr. Anderson,

I am only a freshman here, so I
don't know much yet, but I'm
willing to learn. I was wondering,
and their (sic) are other freshman,
too, who were wondering who Jeff
Miller is (or was). We would ape
preciate an answer to this question
post chaste (sick). Thank you.A.~

notification of Tutorial Adviscrl

Dear A.,

Your letter is being returned to
you, with corrections, Thank you
for writing, I’m glad you asked
that question. It has given me
impetus to begin work on a book
that has been in the planning stage

Note: Anyone who is interested

This year has brought a rise in
consciousness of women‘s issues at
Grinnell College and a resultant
surge of activity. The seriousness
of last semester's problems
illustrated the need for recognition
of women's problems and a need
for effective organization. As a
result. lines of communication are
opening between women, and
organization is taking on greater
meaning. This column will serve
the dual purpose of informing the
campus community about
women‘s activities and providing a
forum through which women can
share ideas and information,
Because the range of possible
topics is so great, there is a need
for participation by as many
people as possible.

As a prelude to exploring issues
of concern to Grinnell women. it is
necessary to explore the
organizations and activities of
previous women’s groups. One
such organization, the Women’s
Group, was formed with the intent
of identifying and coordinating
women's interests, These interests
were concentrated in cons
sciousness raising and educational
activities, such as the proposed
women’s weekend, In addition the
acquisition of films and speakers
was discussed, However it quickly
became apparent that the primary
concern was with the formation of
consciousness raising groups. The
emphasis on personal support
activities precluded projects with a

bage. This book will contain the
true stories of Grinnell's comic
geniuses. Among the living legends
I hope to immortalize in print are
Bill and-or Bob Waldner, "01y”
Olsen, Wendy Knox, Prakash
Ypreti, and the aforementioned
Jeffrey S. Miller. The first chapter

. . so. sir. I bitllinl. sir.“
Jeffrey Scott Miller

”Mr. Jones, sir , . " a burly,
dark-haired senior was speaking to
a nearly empty classroom in 1976.
Those who remained, including a
nervous sophomore who had just
termed the speaker boring, saw his
great muscles tighten and his
sweeping shoulders become icily
erect, and heard his hard, cold
voice rasp out the word “sir” like a
poisoned dart from his massive,
Romanesque head.

broader applicability
c‘ommunity. Consequently the
group failed to take on strong
organizational structure and
seemed to stagnate. Because of its
introspection, the Women's Group
met the needs ofonly a few women,
and the energies and interests of
other women were not integrated,

The Women's Center was in-
stituted at ’the end of the spring
semester of 1975. It is located in
Smith Annex and houses an
unorganized assortment of
women's literature. Although the
idea was a good one, the Center has
been ineffectual due to a lack of
accessibility, publicity, and and
coordination. For instance, the
Center has no regular schedule and
to gain access to it one has to get a
key from the forum desk.
However, should someone take an
active interest in the Center, it
could prove invaluable in
providing resources and a meeting
place for Grinnell women.

The Women's Literary
Magazine, published for the first
time last year, has proved a great
success. It originated as a task
force of the 1976 Women's Group
and was resumed this year by
Tracy Huling and Polly Morris,
The idea of the magazine was to
give creative Grinnell students an

 

opportunity to be published. It
emphasized works by and about
women, although contributions by

“Mr. Jones. sir . . . I'm never
boring, sir. But sometimes I'm
funny, sir; and whenever I'm
funny, sir, a chuckle follows, sir.H

No one regarded this as an idle
boast by the senior student from
Kentucky, Jeffrey Scott Miller.
True, he had not killed a person
since his sophomore days on Mears
second, when an aspiring young
comic from Missouri had the
misfortune to engage the rugged
Kentuckian in a pie throwing
contest (at nine feetl), But all the
school knew that Jeffrey Scott
Miller was a rough and tumble
comedian offand on the classroom
floor—nu longer with cream pies,
but with old one-liners stolen from
lienny Youngman. He himself was
immune to the wounds , . .

Well, it goes on from there. Buy
the book if you want to hear the
rest of the story. Miser.

Women’s issues:
a growing concern

men were welcomed Last year's
magazine was limited to prose and
poetry, but this year it has ex-
panded to include art work. The
success of the magazine is due in
large part to the energies of the
editors. As they are graduating
this year, it is hoped that the task
will be taken up by un-
derclasspeople.

Recently, Now (National
Organization of Women) was in
troduced into Grinnell. For the
firsttime, college and town women
have united in taking a step
towardslmore active organization.
At its first structured meeting -
Tuesday night, the large turnout
and enthusiastic discussion
demonstrated the determination of
women to maintain a strong,
energetic organization in Grinnell.
Task forces were established to
dealwith the women's major areas
of concern: employment, sexuality
(sex education in schools), con-
sciousness raising, dual career
planning (integration ofcareer and
home responsibilities). and day
care facilities.

While the accomplishments of
other women's groups have in
many cases been valuabl‘e,
hopefully NOW can integrate
women‘s concerns into a
legitimate organizational form and
provide resources for constructive
action,
