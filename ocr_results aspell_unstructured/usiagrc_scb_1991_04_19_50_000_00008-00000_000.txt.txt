as becoming more competitive if

The art history curriculum remains
essentially unchanged.

In their original proposal, the
Art Department poinled out that
while Drawing and Design have
becneliminaledasspeciﬁc courses,
the new introductory courses in-
clude “drawing and design com-
ponan tltat insure each student‘s
recognition of the relationships
among drawing, design and any
other form of visual artand develop
imponant and useful skills in these
areas.” In fact, work in a speciﬁc
medium begins only alter a biiet
introduction (13 weeks) in draw-
ing and design, and throughout the
course students have the option to
relum to the drawing studio [or
“more drawing experience in an
alternating sequence.”

The impetus for the change oc-
curred last spring, when two con-
sultants from Oberlin and
Middlebury Colleges came to
Grinnell and observed the Art De-
partment. They suggested doing
away with the Drawing and Design
courses, the trend among most coir
legcs. The Art Department de-
vised are new curriculum during
last spring and this year, The plan
was then voted on by the Humanir
ties Department and approved by

the Cun-iculum Committee.

There were some concerns over
classsize, which thenew plantaised
from the originally proposed ﬁgure
oflziotheslighterlargerclasssize
of 15. This larger size will suppos-
edly make the classes more
cramped. but still workable.

The Art major itself has grown
considerablyoverthepastiew years
from about 15 majors toaround4S.
It is hoped that the new curriculum
will attract more students to the
major and stronger art surdents to
the college through a provision that
would exempt cenain new students
from the introductory courses if
they could prove proficiency
through portfolios or slides.

As the Art Department contin-
uestog‘row,theprospcr:ts forancw
Fine Arts building becomes a topic
of discussion. and while the new
curriculum was designed to func-
tion in the current facilities, it is
easily adaptable to expanded for
cilities. The possibility of such an
expansion, however, will have to
await the arrival of President-des-
ignate Pamela Ferguson.

 

SCARLET & BLACK

Film exposes
destructive impact
of advertising

By Brett Fechheimer

Not too far from here is an
imaginary world that has sur-
rounded almost all of us since the
early years of our childhood. It is a
world in which itis raretoenoounler
a face that isn't Caucasian, nearly
everybody lives in a ”nuclear fame
ily", and everyone who doesn't is a
virile heterosexual. Most notice-
ably, perhaps, it isa world in which
women are artificially beautiful,
impossibly thin, and almost always
frivolous or submissive.

This imaginary world is the
world of American advertising, a
$100billion-a-ycar industry. Mass
media advertisements do more than
sell products. however; they sub-
liminally reinforcean image of who
“we are and shouldbe,"even though
this image may be woefully out of
step with the actual reality of our
society. For instance, contrary to
what the ads tell us, only 12% of
Americans still live in a traditional
“nuclear family" today.

This is the message of Still
Killing Us Softly, a 30minute film
which played Wednesday to a large
crowd in South Lounge. A sequel
to educator Jean Kilboume's 1978
documentary Killing Us Softly, the
ﬁlm consists oia speech Kilboume
gave to acollege-age audience con—
cerning the destructive impact of
careless advertising on American
society, and on women in particu-
lar. In the ﬁlm, she showed exn
amples of these advertisements,al-
mostall ofthem taken from popular
magazines and newspapers.

Her belief is that many ads, eSr
pccially those for hygiene prod-
ucts, makeup, or clothing, drston
and dehumanizc the female body.

Battle ofthe Sex Clark Five - The Sex Clark Five

This album is as hard to ﬁnd as nirvana (the spiritual state, not the
band). and is equally worth searching for. The scs make music that
is as exciting and original as it comes. While most bands in this
country (notto mention England!) are busy grooming their hair and
praclicing being “heavy,” these Huntsville, Alabama natives are
tuming out tons of catchy pop tunes, most of which clock in around
the two minute mark. Jamcs Butler, who I guess is sortofthe leader
of the band, writes great lyrics about Subjects like the Norman
Conquest. liberating Tibet, high school dances, the rearofood. and
the band itself (in “Ballad of Ihe 5C5"). Buy this record as soon as
you see it, because you might never get another chance.

Although one of these ads taken by
itselfmay be harmless or even hu-
morous, their “cumulative. unnon~
scious” effect creates an unattain-
able ideal of"ﬂawless beauty," rc-
iniorcing negativestereotypes. and
even “trivializing the epidemic of
violence against women.”

In one of the ads for hygiene
products shown in the film , a head-
line sporls the words: “If your hair
isn't beautiful, the rest hardly mat-
ters.” The underlying message at
this sort of ad, said Kilbourne, is
“You're ugly. Buy something."

In another printed. this one for a
deodorant, a man and woman are
shown embracing. Above them are
written the words: "Feminine odor
lseverybody'spmblem."l(ilboume
contends that this ad was accept-
able only because it was about
women. Had “Hispanic", for exe
ample, been substituted for “femi-
nine", undoubtedly there would
have been a public outcry.

Even when working women are
shown in ads, she said, their contri-
butions are trivialized, and they are
often portrayed as little more than
sex objects, The ﬁlm presenlsan ad
for bras, with the headline: "Sup-
port yourself in style." Kilboume
believes that this sort of message
belittles the reality of Women in die
workforce.

Mostdisurrbing,perhaps,arelhe
ads which seem almost to condone
the objectification or and violence
against women. One of the zrds in
film is an Esprit ad featuring a
woman lying on an ironing board,
with aman standing over her. With
a smile on his face, he is “ironing"
her, and the iron in his hand is
placed Over her womb. Ads like
this one. Kilboumc pointed out.

are submissive and “real men" are
dominant and brulal,

Still Killing Ur Softly had a
powerful impact on the crowd in
South Lounge, Sophomore Chris
Fletchersald, ”It's unfortunate that
pcoplcaren’tthinkingcntlcallyand
are being unconsciously taken in
by all these advertisements as a
result.“ Sophomore Marian Saksena
believes that some ads have en-
couraged self-hatred and a sense of
inferiority in many women. “I
babysit for kids in the fourth grade
who hate their bodies, and they
have Seventeen magazine ads on
their wall,” she said.
