Looking forward, .Looking Eek-steward

By Dan Rothschild

Light the candles. Monday is the 20th hirthday of the united states
Department ofEducarion. A spin.ofrofthe Department of Health. Edu.
cation, and Welfare. the Department ofEdueation is charged with she are
duous task oftrying to make aviahleeducationnl system in .icounrry where
education is still regarded as a pastime of the weak, a country where vio.
lence and athletic prowess is valued ahove scholarship and ssudy, a country
which routinelycuts educational spending so give the pentagon even more
money than it requests.

Feel pity for she poor Department ofEducarion. This is ohviously nor
an easy row to hoe. .

so what goes into funding she national system of free education that
has heen a hallmark ofrhe American experlcncc for 150 ytars?Th: federal
government only provides 6.8 percent of
the funding for puhlic educasion in this
country; the state and local governments
roughly split die remaining hill. Thus, the
Department of Education is not a huge
factor economically in the operation ofthe
public schools. The majority ofthe fund.
ing for public education comes from state
and local tax dollars. This, ofcourse, falls
neatly in line with she conservative idea
that local governments hesr control their
local schools. The money wields the power,
so goes this train ofshoughs. Th us, say she
conservatives. let the people who pay for
these schools run chem as the local cam-
munisy sees fit.

What this says on the surface and what it really means are very difrerent
ideas. At first blush, this seems like a wonderful idea. The Department of
Education, for all oiio successes, has presided over an era which has seen
the decline in quality of puhlic education and the lack of faish m puhlic
educauon snowball into a sclrfulﬁlling prophecy, where our schools are
getting worse, and people call for drastic reform with inc reasing frequency.
This would seem so say that getting she federal government out of she
husiness of puhlic education would make local schools more fiesihle and
thus hcster ahle to deal with the situations unique so their customers. their
students.

 

But on a deeper level, this egalisarian rhetoric harhors a deeply disturh. ,

ing conservasive Viewpoint: that money in this country is the determinate
ofhow much frce speech a person, organization, or locality may have. Since
conservatives say that campaign constihutions are protected free speech,
dieir argument logically extends to say that local educasional spending is
also a form ofspccch. But using money as she arhiser ofspeech means that

my best friends

By Amanda Desimone

Just the other day, my csahcss friend said “hi" so me in passing. This
hrought a tear to mycye,The fight that ended our friendship haunts me to
this very day. It was during my sophomore year around registration time
when my so-callcd best friend told me to wait in line with the rest of the
scrubs in my tutorial for an appointment with her. I sold her that hesr
friends didn’t play one another like that. And that’s when she flipped out
and said that we were never b5: Friend: and that I should seek psychiatric
help. The restraining order only added insult to injury. I’d like so say thas
I’m over her, hut you never really for
get your ﬁrst best friend.

Fortunately, that experience didn't
deter me from making new friends, I
ﬁgured I could use all the Frlcnds I
could get so I decided to douhlc ma. .

the process. Most people tell inc that
diey only see their advisers when they
need signatures or recommendations. A ’
Not me. I go and visit my advisers when
always so happy so see me. In each orsheiroffices, they have a special hean
hag chair that only I can sit on. Also, my favorite snacks are always on
hand. We sir around and talk for hours ahous how stupid and annoying
their other advisees are. Sometimes, when l'm feeling glum, my advisers
skip their classes and all three of us go to lowa City for a day or two “I
sometimes even a month. Hey, tliat'x what best friends arc for.

At lunchtime, 1 skip over to Faculty House and hang out wish my hest

On a more serious note, my hest friends stay true to their titles as my

don't succeed, give itp. There's no use in heing a damn fool. So now I'm

With a grain of salt

Dear With 0 Grain
of Salt.-
I am so busy. l'm
always tired. i
feel like all I do is
work. I have thrée
heavy reading
and writing
classes and l
have about 600
pages a week to
read. On top of
that I have daily
work for a foreign
language. i never
have time to talk
to friends. l'm very involved in three
campus groups but I don't feel I have
time to enjoy that. My boyfriend
complains that I never have time for him.
l'm exhausted and | feel like l'm getting
sick and the‘semester has just started.
What can I do?
Sincerely,
Frantic

 

Dear Frantic.

That is hard. It might help so consider things in terms of prioritics:
what is your most pressing need? is may not always he academic. Mayhe
some days you need to decide that taking care oryourselfis more impor.
tant than work For esample, deciding that you need to go to sleep will
henefit you when you do Work; you will he hctter ahle to focus and think
clearly. other times your work may he most pressing, or your boyfriend’s
needs or those ofosher friends.

You may find that you don't truly want so he involved in all of she
organisations ofwhich you are pars. learning so say no is helpful (but how
should 1 know, I said yes so writing this columnl).

Working out, sleeping, and eating well will all help so keep you healthy.
While they may seem to he another thing you have so do when there is too
much so do already, she hesser you feel, she more you will he ahle so accom»
plish other tasks and she herset you will cope, compared wish trying so
write papers wish a 102 degree fever, the PEG hegins so sound like less ofa
sime commitmens. You might also want to go to the Health center for a
flu shot.

Finally consider she courses you choose next semester. Work feels more
reasonahle when it is spread out across disciplines. Consider taking a scir
cnce class or a math class. it will lessen your reading load and give you
more variety

if you want more advice, make an appoinsmens wish Jo Calhoun or
someone in the AcademicAdvising Office in she studentAftaits office in
she Forum They are patientand experiencedin helpingssudensswish com
plaints like yours.

Take care.

Dear Frantic,

sounds like the story ofmy lifel l have she impossible tssk orsrying to
ﬁnish everything in one day and still manage to get at least four hours of
sleep a night. 1 don't recommend that as a strategy. Well, there are three
ways ofcuring this. 1) your work hecomes your life, hut as thesaying goes,
“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy”; 2) screw school and have
fun, hut l'm pretty sure Mom and Dad did not pay $26,000 aycat for you
so pussy, or 3) balance.

Yes, you too can work hard in college, he involved, and ssill manage so
have asocial life out is involves putting your life on a schedule. You will
have so he at the mercy ofa planner, hut it's a good invetmcns to make.
use it for deadlines, dates for activities, tocdo list, etc. Use is like a Bihle.

something else 1 found just this year to he useful is a "to-do" list. After
you get showered and dressed, take as least five minutes of time hefore you
go to class and write down everytkikgyou have to do that day. Moss imporc
sanrly, . ck to die listl ls may seem overwhelming as ﬁrst, helicve me,
realizing you have only 24 hours to do so dungs can seem very daunsing,
hus ifyou stick so the list, you will accomplish just ahous everything.

on the homework load, my French profand adviser gave me the hesr
advice on how to do the homework. However much time you spend in

eneh class, invest twice as much time min the homework (Except for social
srudies, then its three times as much). You may not tlnish the assignment

law at least you will have invesscd enough time in order to know what is
going on in class.

on weekends, rashcr than sleeping until three in the afternoon, sry put.
ring in some lihrary time on projects or papers due in your classes. The 3—
4 hours invested will pay offwhcn all of your classmates are stuck doing
things at the last minute while you are sleeping in comfort, knowing that
you‘re done.

l..us hits not least, social life. something that is ohviously very impotr
sans to you hut hard to fit in. It good to have asocial life hut it will send to
take a hieltseat so your work. it's unfortunate hut don’t despair. You may
not he role to see your friends or state into she eyes ofyour novio everyday
hut they can sull he a part ofyour life. Try to as least have lunch or dinner
with your friends ifyou have to hang with them Or she occasional visit to
your friends' rooms wouldn't hurt, just keep in mind that your homework
tomes l s so limit your discussions. The same thing can he done with
your hoyiriend. or you could )ust set aside Friday or Saturday night just for
him.

Balancing y our life involves a lot or trial and error in order to see what

uits you. You ean try these suggestions and come up with your own

sy on that works. ' ey, hecause that‘s she only way you will

' ‘nillt‘gc withous having an ulcer.

Bulancc I.
