John McEnroe fuels his outstanding per
formance with negative energy. In an age
where athletic conditioning becomes as
much oi a mental workout as a physical
one. McEnroe's negative energy is booed
on the court as well as in the training
room. For the theme of th Eighties is con-
fidence: If you can believe it; you can
achieve it,

“Mental training in athletics is a very
young concept in terms of American
sports." notes Grinnell volleyball coach
Cindy Mueller. “If we’re not winning, it’s
because we're not doing something
physically.” The Soviets however, over-
came this iallacy long ago, and continue to
harvest the golden beneﬁts of mental
preparation. '

Coach will Freeman cited a study con
ducted by the Soviets on their lodoOlympic
Team. Four groups. each of which split
their training time into a different ratio of
physical versus mental training, were
studied, The group which spent 75% oi the
time training mentally and only 25% on the
physical skill out performed the other
physical percentages of 50%. 75%. and
100%! ! !

Though mental training is nota new face
in the Grinnell athletic arena, it has only
recently manifested itseli extensively.

A most prominent case arose on the
cross-country scene this Fall. The Grinnell
team that raced away with this year‘s
midwest Conference championship was
essentially identical to last year’s top
nucleus. Why this marked rise in success?
“It is my contention that success depends
mostly on the mental aspect of training.”
says Coach Freeman. Freeman im-
plemented a full mental development pro
gram into the team's training tor the first
time this season.

Initially, the runners delineated sets of
individual and team goals, short and long-
term Emphasis was placed on repetitive
exposure to these goals. “We tend to dwell
on our currently dominant thoughts," said
Freeman, “Iandi we will move in the
direction of our goals if we think about
them often."

The next stage involved visualization of
these goals. Visualization is “the process
of using mental images to practice in the
mind what one would like to see in a future
event." These bi-weekly sessions were
preceded by a relaxation technique which
alternates tensing and relaxing of muscle

positive self-talk and reinforcement of

For Sophomore runner Greg Evans, self-
Coniidence is everything. In order to suc-
ceed, he explained, you must reach a point
where you are relaxed and confident about
yourself. Evans.‘conference champion of

thinks of his menml edge as “mental
toughness." “I've had this mental
toughness since my senior year," he said,
“ever Since then, I’ve realized I can ace

to." Evans. impressed with the relaxar
[ion/visualization techniques learned from
his high school coach. applauds Freeman
in his extensive research. “One of die
main reasons I came to Grinnell," he said.
“was because Will was experimenting
with it."

Greg Evans, a threeyear student of
mental preparation, has done extensive
reading on the subject and uses it in his
academics as well a spersonal life. Said
Evans, “It‘s taken me a long, long time to
develop.” But as his victories prove, his ef—
forts have been well rewarded. Attributing
both conference victories to his extensive
mental training, evans relives his recent
win at Chicago: “I warmed up and then
stretched . . . I went and I laid down the
track at the University of Chicago . . r 1
went through the entire race in my mind.
everything . . . when I got up, I was
prepared. I was confident I was going to
win,” Evans, however, visualized the
course incorrectly. He confused the
number of times he would have to loop
each secition. His visualization was so ef-
fective that twice, he had to be called back
onto the course. “Both times," he said, “I
ran like the Visualization",

“My biggest problem is trying too hard".

she said, ”If I try to put (the racet off, not
think about it, I do better ” Bishop does not
reject the philosophy of mental prepara
tion, but as she states: "I just don't think
its tor everyone.”

Coach Mueller is also incorporating
mental fitness into her volleyball pro—
gram. Like the harriers. the netters engag»
ed in visualization twice weekly. During
visualization, team members iocused on a
particular skill, developed a mental at
titude, and finally iormed a mental picture
of themselves performing the skill.

Visualization also iound a place on the
court, when new skills were taught.
Mueller provided an example of the skill.

Each night before a volleyball match.
Sackett would lie down and Visualize: “I
would usually run through a game in my

but the entire match, I would try to imr

Sackett iound that mental preparation not
only aided her in team sports such as
volleyball, but in her individual perfor-
mances in track as well. As she explained
it. “In a team sport you have to concen-
trate on doing something technically
whereas in running, you have to concen-
trate on doing something that your body
feels is right."

Assistant football coach and spot-Ls
psychologist Jim Gilbert studies the rela—
tionship between levels oi arousal and per-
formance. “Different motor skills require
different levels of arousal." he said. All
athlete performing finely-tuned skills in a
state pf high arousal is “more likely to not
process information as efficiently“,
whereas “open or gross" skills are not af-
fected by such high arousal states. Un-
wanted high arousal can be dealt with by
task analysis, “focusing on the
biomechanics of the skill." In this manner,
one can attempt to reach an “optimal level
of arousal".

Chris Knoepfie. Grinnell running back
who led the conference in rushing stats this
fall, finds his optimal level of arousal
through selHnduced feelings of anger,
“During the week.” says Knoepfle, “I
think of the other team like they're my
enemies —- and this climaxes with the
STARSPANGLED BANNER.” At this
point, he’s motivated to ”break tackles, ig»
nore the pain, and run over people," via a
flow of ‘negative’ mental energy much like
that utilized by McEnroe.

Judy Hunter. coach of the women’s ten-
nis team, believes that 90% of the game is
in the head, “If you don't concentrate.’ she
said. “the other person will beat you no
matter what ability you have." To help her
players achieve the level of concentration

Longtime coach and former athletic
diretor John Ptitsch has had ample oppor-
tunity to observe sports psychology at
work after coaching football. basketball.
tennis, and soccer. His first experience
with the mental aspects of sports came in
the 1950s when Piitsch developed his
“Water Bucket" Theory to try to help a
struggling football program. Pfitsch was
convinced that anxiety was causing “flat"
performances. He blamed this partially on
the fact that tradition dictated that a team
“gathers all the water it can rind to pour
out the fire every week." He changed this
so that only certain games were targeted.
and his team went from an 0-8 record to
4-24 the following season. In addition,
Pfitsch uses visualization and internaliza-
tion. which allows that “from mind to
body. you can convince yourself that you
can do something that you really can't
do."

Even though mental training can help
you “be all you can be", the essence of the
sport is still the pure enjoyment. Ruhr

does utilize some mental aspects of
athletics but for the most part. “you just
