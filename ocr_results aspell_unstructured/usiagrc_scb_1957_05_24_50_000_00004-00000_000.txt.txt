Li'F‘l' Phone, Hear Tone, Dial;
A‘F'ler Tha’r, Any'l‘lling Happens

By Arlene Cleveland

As far as the phone 5) stem is collcellietl,

situation as 01 W ednestl'dy

here’s the

Monday night (it was mining) due to splicing of 21 main
cable, all north campus phones “(316 dead. This cleated a
quiet evening in the Quad, as all calls “816 purely from

girl to girl There wercnt very
many calls and even if the
phone did chance to ring, it was
like coaxing a donation out oi
a pinball machine to get any
one to get up to answer. We
all knew whom they weren't
trom.
Dialing Rings Bell

Tuesday morning men were
found allover all the halls. Re-
gardless oi what one hears about
other times, these men Tuesday
am, were trom the telephone
colnpanyichecking up, wiretap.
ping. etc. Now, the dial tone is
much louder. and the bell con—
veniently rings each time you
dial a number.

The iirst time the iloor
phoire did ring, it had it more
alurmeclonkish sound. No oire
answered it immediately; it
turned out to be a girl. Later
in the day, people were iound
eonirisetlly looking in the
“green pages” oi the new die
rectory to rind numbers, etc.
it was their discovered that
by calling Dibble 2 you could
get Dibble basement. it also held
true that it you called Dibble
basement you get Dibble 2.
Aiter a phone demonst’l‘atlon
(it was still raining), as we all
hadn’t had a chance to use the
new dial system, it was learn:
ed that: no phones in Langon
were wo ing except the presir

dents suite; Loose Cellar De.
tachment always had a busy
signal; that to call anywhere in
Gates, you had to use the phone
in South Younker basement;
and that vou shouldn’t trust the
number on your phone, as the
directory says that number is
something else.
Choice 01 nails

Clad-k and Rawson basements
had the same phone, so the
caller got a choice of halls. By
dialing outside to the train ste-
tion and neglecting to dial “9"
first, you could talk to Professor
Kuntz And Charlie Foster's of-
ﬁce could be reached by dialing
the Womens gym.

it was then that this assign.
ment was phoned to me The
party on the other end said
“5&3 would like n story on

be iadcd oii into the distance.

I asked it he could speak up,
as 1 couldn’t hear what he was
s 'ing. There was another
e ck, and this timc'lre was
screaming in nry oar . new
phone system."

At a distance ot about three
paces from the receiver, 1 said
"Wh‘at'l" AIter his mission was
accomplished, he closed by say—
ing. "This new phone sytem—
just doesn't work at all."

Thus an issue
that once seeme
ed to die ot old

momentarily r
vived and i
solved. Maybe some salt ot new
day is dawning . . .

This is the last issue oi the
5&3 that most oi you will see
this year, since we don’t come
out with one during finals.
We’ll get a rest betore the
“big unc"—the Commencement
issue, which will summarize
the year's activities ior’visit-
ing iriends and alumni. What
it nmounts to is a little inas-
tcrpieco oi journalism that the
stud comes up with after six
or eight million man-hours- oi
work and twenty or thirty
gull-ops or sweat.

i‘ve been looking through past
issues at the 5&3 and reading

and some oi the old columns, I
icel good about the years work.
and 1 hope that it impressed
you that way, too.

I’d like to express my thanks
to everyone who has taken the
time and trouble to turn to
“Sackcloth and Ashes" every

that it was a pleasure. Thanks.

Some Gl'innell students know little about some basic

test llicludetl si'\ questions about the S&B.

Returns were received from
412 students, or 53.23% oi the
774 students living on campus.
124 freshmen, 105
sophomores, 90 runiors and 80
seniors were tested.

the 5&3, who
helped to get me started and
to Lori DeLay, present editor.
who has suiiered under a nul-
iron dead deadlines and dying
jokes, and can look ioruaid to
many more

Grrnnell has had a good year.
0t course. seniors think it is
going to the devil and treshmen
still don’t know what to think.
Many ot those in between

should be reminded of their ine‘

nocencc, ignorance, and tarlure
to realize that the Grinuell stu-
dent has a large measure oi
responsibility toward the work
ings oi the college.

Grinnell, like any other in-
stitution, is made at the peo-
ple who attend it and attend
to it. It’s regarded as one oi
the best because its people
are some oi the best, a fact
which never tails to make me
think oi green pastures and
sunshine.

Well, good luck on ﬁnals and
camps and papers etc. Have a
good summer. drrre ct ciully,
