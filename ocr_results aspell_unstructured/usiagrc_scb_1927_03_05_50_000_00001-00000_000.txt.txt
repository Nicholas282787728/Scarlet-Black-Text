DEBATERS ORATE
AT AMES TONIGHT

Negative Team to Finish Dual Dcllfif/e
Oil McNury Hansen liilL

Gi'innell will oppose Iowa state 0017
legc tonight in the second debate of
a dual meet when a team composed
of Laurence Lunrlcn, Mack ’ Swigert
and Robert Blil'lingame, upholding
the negative, will clash with the Ames
men on the MeNary-Haugen farm re~
lief hill.

The first meeting of the
affirmative with the Ames
was marred by the lack of clashing
arguments. However, the negative
team is well prepared and with the
ever increasing interest manifestcd in
the bill, which was vetoed by Presir
dent Coolidge, a lively discussion is
expected. This debate'will be of a
no-decision open forum type.

On Friday, March 11, a Grinnell af-
firmative team will travel to Cedar
Falls to meet the debaters represent-
ing Iowa State Teacher‘s college on
the McNaryrHaugen bill. This will be
of the openeforum type also. The
men making the trip are Clarence Ja»
cohson, Ray Cleland, and Loren Reid.

“The South .lmericau pcople (loll

Sopners Win By
'4 One-Sided Score‘

Grlulll'll Bi lieteo Dcfczllctl in First
Giulia of Trip South, 56 to 2:2.

Gl'lnnell met Oklahoma. an the Soon-
ers' floor yesterday ilftei'nimn, but the
Pioneers were left it the post, and
the southern team closed their Seusun
With a. 55 to 22 victory. IT. was the
largest score that has been run up
against the Pioneers in five years.

AS usual the game was a knock
down and drag out affair with both
teams Scoring a dozen personals
apiece. Davis and Hall, rival centers
were finally expelled late in the game
when they engaged in an argument,
accompanied by appropriate gestures
of [he flstic variety.

West Scores Heavy

Cnptaln “’est of the Snollcrs led the
the attack, and during his time in the
game scared seven baskets and three
field goals, closely followed by his
teammate, Drak , with six fielder:
and four donations. During the first
half Gl‘l'nuell scored only two\ goals

from thc field, both by Davis Who
Sunk Them from the middle of this
floor. The score at the end of the
period was 23 to 6.

Oklahoma drew first blood when
LeCrone looped a free throw after
Coggeshall missed his'chance on a
double foul right after the starting
lipoff. Captain West then Sank three
double Counters in rapid succession,
and the sky-scraping Holt tipped in
another and made a‘glft point before
Gi‘innell again scorer], this time on a
free throw by Chase, Davis folluweil
with one of his long shots, but the
Sooners got going again, and had the
score 20 to 4 just before the cluse of
the period when Davis repeated his
earlier performance.

Chase Not In Form

Chase was not up to his usual form,
due to his old injuries, and PetcPson,
Who relieved him, was the only Fio-
near who was able to break through
the Sooner defense. ‘He scored three
baskets and one free throw, the most
points he has made in any one game
this Sensun.

The Sooners used practically every
eleglble man that Owned at basketball
Suit, at some time during the game,
and Coach Haves also sent in all his
Substitutes.

Gi'ilill'ilg System Different

The grading sustcm is veiy different,I

said Mr Campos. The
commission uses three halls, reds,
whites and blacks. Three red halls
make an A grade but two blacks and a
white constitute ftrflunking mark.

There are no tuition and fees to pay
in the universities, except at Cour
cepcion, where tuition is 150 pesos or
about 17 dollars.

"There are no fraternities or sor-
orities in Chili," said Mr. Campos.
“They have a. Student Federation to
promotes dances, protect the students
and get lower prices. The only time
the boys and girls get together much
at all is at the Spring Feast put on by
the Federation This lasts three days.
and you have a big time dancing

it is a masquerade and nobody knows
you. They elect a queen, whether she
is a student or not, provide her- with
a court and make poems to her."

“But don't you have dates at other
times?" the reporter asked.

Know Girls By Letter

"No, all acquaintance with girls is
done by letters, For example, ifJ
see a girl 1 like downtown, 1 get
presented to her through her par-
ents; but if i cannot manage it, 1 get
her address and write to her. You
have to get acquainted with the frtlnr
ily and then you go on business to
see the father just to be with the girl
a few minutes. They never let you
alone unless you are engaged. My
gosh—if a father sees you kissing his
daughter, he will kick you in the pants
and shoot you." He added that girls
attended dances as well as boys but
they never went or returned together.

"But I should not think correspond-
encc very satisfactory." the reporter
objected. ,

"Oh, yes it is. or course, you have
to do a lot of wall-jumping and things
like that, you know," he answered
with a smile, ”And by golly. you want
to be careful when you pick your
wife because if you miss your girl
you are done-there is no divorce in
Chili.” Later, in discussing duelling,
he said, “There is only one way to get
a divorce—either the man or the wo-
man is killed,"

Dnollhig Is Common

Duelling is quite common in Chili,
according to Mr. Campos, whois him-
self an excellent fencer and who has
a silver cup and several medals won
in fencing tournaments at Chicago
university. The southern way of set-
tling a uuarrel is to draw acircle and
whip your enemy out of the ring with
longrlasned whips. The more com»
mon practice is to fight with knives.

"hurt when a man is killed doesn’t
the government punish the murder-
er?" he was askcd.

"Oh yes. But they have ways
getting around that. He sometimes
leaves the country. Most of the duels
are in the Upper and Lower House."

“Phog” Allen’s Kansas Jayhawks
clinched their sixth consecutive cage
title by their 29 to zl victory over the
Kansas Aggies at Lawrence.

Howrwel', the Jayhawker victory last
night was totally unnecessary, for
bad they been lligrhedi‘ted they could
have donated the last contest to the
Aggies, and still finished at the top
of the percentage column, for every
other team in the loop has lost at
least four games. The game that
really decided the title was played
Thursday night when Kansas downed
Missouri for the second time this
year.

Sobvlfers Fiii‘sh Socmitl

By downing the Pioneers in a scor-
ing spree, 56 to 22 last night, the 0k.
lahoma Sooncrs finished in second
place. but considerably behind the
champions.

The 1927 r ce that closes with three
games, D eeNehraska, Missouri-
washington and Grinnellroklahomd
aggies, tonight was was one of the
closest in the history’ of the league.
and was featured by more upsets than
an auto polo game. In the first place,
at the beginning of the season, the
Sorcalled experts were loud in was
claiming the downfall of the perennial
champion Kansans, and were busy
speculating as to who would next he
crowned king.

Allen Drops Games

It did look for a while as if the
scribes had made a good guess, for
the wilcy Allen followed up his pr
season hear stories, by letting his
team drop a couple of expected set-
ups. First Ames turned the trick, 13
to 12, and then Charley Black took his
Husker team to Lawrence and defeat-
ed his alma mater by a lhi'eCrpoillt
margin. That left the Kansas Aggies,
Oklahoma and Missouri in the race,
but the \ioi'mer, reckoned the best
team, was defeated by both Oklahoma
teams in a bad weekend, and then to
clinch matters, lost a couple more
that they should have. won, Kansas
took care of Missouri by- themselves,
although they hlld some outside help.
and various other teams saw that no
more Valley championships of any
kind should go to the state of Okla-
homa.

Fight For llmirrs

The fight for high honors was even
closer. At present, Peterson of Kane
sas leads Byers of the Aggies by one
point, 126 to 125, although Sinaba,
still has a chance, but it is a slim one,
and his team will have to heat Drakc
tonight by a score resembling the
Grinnelkfiklahoma game with Smaba
doing most of the work. The day

The Pioneer mermen will take part
in their last dual meet or the season
next Tuesday evening when they will
contest with the Ames splashers in
the lowa State pool. This will be
the last sflpearance of the Grinnell
swimming team before the Missouri
Valley conference meet at Arnes on
March 11 and 12.

Stotts, Grinnell’s nmst consistent
scorer, will again tangle with Vor—
hces, the Ames diver, who has defeat-
ed the Pioneer once this season, in
the Ames-Drake-Gl‘innell triangular
meet at Des Moines. Stotts had been
out of the water for nearly a week

rior to that contest due to 2m in-
licted arm, but with this difficulty
behind him, can be counted upon to
score heavily in the event. Bray
should also place in the event. ’

Martin, and Blair are two sprint
swimmers who will provide competi-
tion in their events. Martin has con»
sistently pushed the winner in all his
(races, oncc losing to the Allies dash
man by a ‘short stroke at the end of
his race. With two more years ahead
of him, this splasher can be relied
upon to count considerably for future
Pioneer swim outﬁts.

Cohen will swim the backstroke,
and with the added aid of good can-
ditioning may out-paddle his Antes
Irival.

McCornack, Allison, Perry, Wood»

compete in the Ames meet in the
various events and relays.

In the race for the cellar position,

both teams have only two victories
