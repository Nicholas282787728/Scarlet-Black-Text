C To the Football Team:

Tomorrow night as you begin your second
season in the Mid-west conference, you will
be watched by Grinnell’s most enthusiastic
crowd in many seasons. Why? Because
the student body has been pleased to wit-
ness the new drive which you have ex-
hibited this year in your practices, as well
as the sportsmanlike manner in which you
accepted tlle fact that you were not to be
given “athletic subs", And tonight at the
pep meeting and tomorrow at the game
you will be shown that your colleagues in
the bleachers have assumed a share in
your outlook,

To say just exactly what characterizes
this new attitude is difficult. It is partly
optimismithe belief that you, the Pioneers,
have become a better team. But aside from
that, it is a spirit willing to back you so
long as you “play the game" to the best
of your abilities.

And, in that spirit, we say, for our»
selves and the-entire school, BEST OF
LUCK, SONS OF OLD GRINNELL! Keep
up the good work!

O Quarterbacks’ Club

Recently the footballrminded townspeople of
Grinnell organized into a body which they
thought would perform a valuable service
to Grinnell college and to themselves. This
organization goes under the name of the
Monday morning Quarterbacks club and,
obviously, is primarily concerned with foot-
balll Because We students have a very real
interest in our football team, we owe it to
the club to become acquainted with their
program. ‘
Already the club has given a large ban-
quet, at which each football player on the
squad was the special guest of some influ-
ential Grinnellian. Already, members of
the club have sold dozens of season football
tickets in and around the community, ex—
pressing their personal interest and finan-
cial confidence in the team. Through the
efforts of these loyal Grinnellians, eleven
of our football players have been given ops

portunities ill stores and factories to earn
their way through college. All of these
things have been done selflessly to pro—
mote and preserve a football spirit at Grin~
nell that once crushed the Drake Bulldogs
85—0.

This year one of Grinnell’s greats in the
sporting realm, Benny Douglas, is coaching
our football team. Respected by townspeople
and, more important, by every member of
the team, Coach Douglas must neccssarily
begin to build slowly. We don‘t expect him
to perform miracles. If he can instill a
fighting spirit into the team, if we can be
fighting proud of our team after every
game, then victories are of minor imports
once.

But what of us, the student body? How
should we view the Quaiterbacks’ club and
all that they have done‘.7 We should and
must say something like this: ”We are
grateful for what you how done: We will
accept the challenge, and in a hundred ways
faithfully (mil loyally back the Grimlell
college football team in victory and defeat!”

0 Danger: Public Opinion

In these difficult days for democracy we
hear much of the dangers which from all
sides beset the institutions of free govern-
ment. The menace of the Nazi, the threat
of the “fifth-columnist," the peril inherent
in the “third term" or in unwise “appease-
lnent”—all are paraded before us as major
hazards lving atllwart the democratic path.
And so they are, But no less a danger is
that from public opinion

For there is nothing which can so efv
fectively destroy civil liberties as a wrongly
guided public opinion

Nor is it especially difficult to influence
that opinion, even to destroy liberties which
have been both traditional and fundamental
in our land. It was done quite simply about
twenty-five years ago. Today> the process
seems even less complex. A few hysteric
utterances from high officialdom, a declara—
tion of a ”national emergency,” a splurge of
cheap chauvinism—and, presto, it is now—
“umAmerican” to refuse to hate as the
government hates or worship at the shrine
of the military. Thus already has passed
our onetime complete freedom of thought.

Neither is the ease with which public
opinion can be misled alone responsible for
its danger to civil liberties The extremities
to which it all too often fluctuates plus the
unm igated power inherent in the thing it-
self renders it a dreadful weapon for the
destruction of freedom. Once convinced that
the “protection" of our democracy requires
the suspension of civil liberties, public
opinion can—and ill the past hasibecome
the greatest agent for their removal. The
inglorious chronicle of our treatment of
those refusing to endorse our participation
in the first World War contains ample proof
of that

So extreme, so powerful was public
opinion then that in one benighted city a
street—corner preacher was arrested as un-
patriotic for reading aloud the words,
“Blessed are the peaceemakel's . . .

Whether or not public opinion will again
sink so low is yet unknown, but it has al-
ready begun to skid. Even now there are
those who have been tricked into believing
that democracy can be preserved ill this
country by supressing the civil liberties up-
on which that democracy is based. And in
that attitude lies far greater danger to free
government in the United States than in all
the Brownshirts in Gemlany.

VVill/(ie Realizes
Sound Agricultural
Policy Vital

By William 0, nan-ls.
Welcomed by Omaha’s cheering
thousands, Wendell L. Willkie last
night delivered the major farm
address of his campaign for
election to the presidency of the
United States.

Avoiding, as he cal-1y pledged
to do, all attacks upon personnlic
ties, even where ample justifica-
tion exists, Mr. Willlde promised
to continue those aspects of the
present sci-m program which hare
proved themselves at am to the
rural population. At the same
time, he recognized both the nwd
for strengthening the present
plan and adding new measures
to raise the farm income to its
proper proportion.

But more important than either
of these pledges was his recogni-
tion of the fact that the farm
pmblcm is but a part of the en-
tire national problem—an integral
part to be sure, but neverthe-
less just part. In this analysis
of the farm situation Willkie set
forth in a few moments what the
entire New Deal has not discover-
ed in seven years. And that is
the fact the rural areas can not
hope for their proper share of
the national income until the
urban industrial areas have
enough purchasing power to buy
more farm products.

Inst/Ball of recognizing that as
the fundamental issue, the pres-
ent administration has attempted
to augment the farmer's income
artificially lrom thc wells of the
public credit. In this it has been
TEMronAmLY successful. But
only temporarily, for the prob—
lcm is no closor to solution now
than when the Barvard-voiwd
radio artist experienced his first
inaugural. And it wiu continue to
be but a stoprgap solution so
long as the lam “innm‘ circle”
refuses to come to grips with
economic realities.

Not only has the farm pro—
gram or the New Deal produc-
cd mere temporary benefits tor
the farmer, but the entire system
is based upon an unsound eco-
nomic premise: namely, that the
income of one quarter of the
nation’s populaLion can be eter-
nally augmented at public ex»
pense. And, Juvenile as it ap~
pears, that principle has been
expounded by several high New
Dealersithe theory that we are
in a contracting economy which
will necessitate a continuous dis-
tribution of public funds. Just
how the government is expect-
ed to continue paying out more
in subsidies than it receives in
taxes and remain solvent is as
yet an unsolved mystery.

Already the federal government
has passed out billions of claims
in crop subs 'cs, conservation
hcnciits, and other forms of farm
dividends. The money has gone
is: toward building a. magni-
ficent may of pain voters, but
can anyone—even the stuunchest
of Roosevelt mcnqumcscly de-
cIm-e the farm problem has been
permanently solved? No! The
surpluses continue to mount, and
the iamcrsl income continues
at its low propel-timid level.

Mr. Willkie can accomplish all
those things if he is elected is
