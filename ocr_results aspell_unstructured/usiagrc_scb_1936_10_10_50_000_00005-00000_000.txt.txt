Men, Women Tell Habits
of Others Which
They Dislike.

By Elisabeth Dwight I

Now, men, just sit back andé
think for a minute. The last time [
you called your ecstasy for a-
date for Friday night did she
sweetly but firmly say. “I’m awfulr
ly sorry. but I'm busy," and make
no mention of a women‘s varsity
date?

When you women called your
passion, who may or may not be
secret, to ask him to varsity, did
he mumble, “Sorry, but my sister
is coming this weekend?"

Provided your technique in ask-
ing for a date is up to form, and
. provided you use all the remedies
for B, a. and housemaid's knee,
you are probably not watching
those little things that ir itate
members of the opposite Sex. And
opinions about the campus showed
quite a few of “those little things."

Against Red Fingernails

Bill Fowler. football captain,
sparing the reporter a moment be»
fore practice, had to think hard
before he found fault with women.
but on second thought, decided
red fingernails, giggling. and
screaming were his aversions.

We sought out Betty Carries,
feeling such action only fitting,
and found her in the College shop,
She shuddered at the thought of
dirty fingernails and crew hair
cuts. adding plaid shirts to her
list. “The little plaids 1 don’t
mind," she hurriedly qualified her
statement, “but I don’t like noisy
ones,"

Silly Men Disliked

Barbara McBride was at the
College shop. too, and added silly
men, and men who think they can
get away with telling you what to
do. to the already mentioned dirty
fingernails and crew cuts. “Oh
yes," she went on. “1 hate con-
stantly lllagroomed men.”

“There is nothing worse than
women who don't know the art of
making up," emphatically de-
clared Max Hunn, managing editor-
,of the Scarlet and Black, “And 1

in the bookstore, John Buckley,
presrdent of the Council of House
Presidents, told me he didn't like
too much talkativeness, and girls

He found it hard to think of any-

up her penny postcard, and left
him to his conference with a book
agent.

Informal Debate
Held at Meeting

Ari informal debate on whether

Answer is Beside the Point
When we finally squeezed the
question rn. he said, “Because
right now I'd give anything for
about 10 good men reporters,”
which was beside the point, so the
reporter slid down from her per-ch

only to meet Johnny Spence, foot-
hall player and pep committee
head.

“I don't like red finger-nails or
these screwy hats women wear."
he explained. Nor tlid hc approve
of catty or- twosfaced women.
"Most of the girls around here
aren't bad about these things,
though " he stated in more serious
vein. Just say everything Phyl
