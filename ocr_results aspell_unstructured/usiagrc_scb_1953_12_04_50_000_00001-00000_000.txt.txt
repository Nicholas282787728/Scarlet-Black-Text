On Composite Government Plan

A picture of a composite student government structure wasl The fall wavemion 0f the

Dean Fuller reported to the

Stanford university.'President Samuel N. Stevens asked him

Though all three

characteristics, their basic

, governmental structure is the
me. It’s outstanding charac- ,
teristic is that all non-aca- ,
demic regulations are 11151th
by student government, com. 3
pletely independent of the fol-
Culty or administration of the
schools, Dean Fuller said,
The only exception to this is
the drinking ruler

All rules are also enforced by
the students, through judicial
boards, and while appeal to the
administration is present in the
system, student judicial decis»
ions are seldom, if ever, modle
fled. As an example, Dean Ful-
ler cited Stanford's experience,‘
in which a student judicial deev
cision has never been changed
since the present governmental
system went into effect 27 years‘
ago.

schools

In turn, Dean Fuller empha-
sized, academic matters are the,
concern of the iaculty and ad~
ministration alone. i

The base oi the composite ‘

student government structure
is on “executive council" he
said. This council is composed
of a president and vice presi-
dent of the student body, a.
president and vice president
oi the men students, and a
president and vice president of
the women students, plus the
editor oi the campus news.
paper, and seva representa-
tives elected at large by the
students.

This group, he said, appoints
.11 other officers oi student
government and activities, from
presidents of activity clubs to
members of the judicial hoards.
The chuncil is also the sole
legislative agency in student
government.

, Thus, responsibility tor all
student affairs is centcrcd on

judicial committees
; pointed by it, and its activ»
lties carried out by committees
i students appointed by it. The
tudent government has full
tower of discipline, from the
,nower to reprimand to the
cwer to expel.

Because, Dean Fuller stated,
the system couldn’t survive
without a thorough under-
standing oi it by the stu»
dents, and a high degree of
interest in its activities, an
integral part of the structure
is a group of junior and sen-
ior studcnts called “sponsors,"

Dean Fuller said.

President Stevens, who in.
troduced Dean Fuller at the
meeting, said that the success
oi a system such as this de-
pended upon the student body
feeling that it has full and
complete responsibility. “Stu-
dent government must be
more than a piece of paper,"
he said. .

Dean Fuller emphasized that
he was not advocating that
Grinnell students adopt the
same structure, but rather wishe
ed to point out how other

schools were attacking govern-I

mental problems. He Stated that
these schools lent themselves to
a “transfer of experience.‘

tion to the Cyclone in the fee.
, Barry Lawrence‘and Ed Ling,
{Cyclone editor and business
manager, stated that last year
aiter being appointed heads oi
lthe 1954 yearbook, they began
l promoting the inclusion of the
.annual in the semester fee.
They held that it would enable
them to lower the cost of the
,yearbook and produce a better
iquality book.

They proposed the idea to
the Central committee, who
reierred them to the Student
Organizations committee, they
stated. Dean of Men Henry
a. Brown, chairman oi that
committee, said he would
check with President Samuel
N. stevens and controller Nore
ris Neveln, and then report
to them, stated the yearbook
. heads.

Lawrence and Ling said that
they felt money tor the annual
jcculd be obtained from the
twenty percent oi the semester
,fee which was regtJhlrly held
,back from distribution in a re»
.serve fund.

, They said that Dean Brown
,reportcd to them that the plan

 

was feasible if it found support

jfrom the Central committee.

They then went to the Central
committee and received a
,promise that the money would
be allocated to them on the
basis of $1.25 a student each
semester.

They went ahead with their
plans on that basis, lowering
the cost oi the book from
five to {our and onehalf doL—
lars, and signing contracts ior

l photography, printing and
l binding,
l Dean Brown said yesterday
that their account oi events is
substantially correct, with one
I exception.
l He said that instead of full
[approval for taking the moncy
lfur the Cyclone out of the re-
[serve fund of the semester
tfee, he and controller Neveln
explained to Lawrence and
thing that the activities covered
[by the fee regularly spent
labout $5,000 more than the total
liee, including the reserve fund.
t t‘l’resident Stevens," Dean

Brown said, “told the two
yearbook heads that ii the
money was available and the
central committee approved
the inclusion of the Cyclone
in the ice they would receive
the funds. Apparently," he
said, “the circumstances re-
garding the reserve fund were
never made clear."

He also commented that the
confusion was partly a result
of the time during which the
negotiations took place. Most
of the discussions took place
during the final week of the
year, when it was impossible
to get any committcc together
in a body.

This year.
submitted

an apportionment

 

ment of the semester tee, and,
the reiusal of the faculty to‘

ganlzations committee that the Cyclone be allotted the

$1,200,

The affirmation was necessary as a result of faculty
taction taken November 16. The
:tion of the semester fee because the Central committee had
‘not formally approved the allotment, and because it felt
Imore information on the division was necessary before

faculty tabled the alloca—

ganizations by the Central com-
mittee was not made on the
basis of submitted budgets and
requests, but was drawn up
from the apportionment made
last year. The Cyclone was in—
cluded in that apportionment,
which was sent back to the
Central committee by the Stu-
dent Organizations committee.

Then, wihout waiting for
formal action by the Central
committee, on November 11
and 18 the student Organiza—
tions committee drew up an
allotment which included the
Cyclone and submitted it to the
faculty meeting on November
16. This was the same allot-
ment which the iaculty then
tabled, and which the Central
committee formally approved
last Wednesday. The appon
tionment will come up before
the faculty at its meeting
Monday.

The $1,200 allocated to the
Cyclone is $360 less than the
amount anticipated in the year—
book’s budget, which was ap»
proved by the Board of Pub-
lications. Lawrence and Ling
say that the $860 will have to
be made up by the 789 students
who purchased the book.

This will be possible because
on the sales contract which
each purchaser signed, the fol—
lowing qualification is made: “If
for any reason this money is
not paid through the indirect
plan, the customer must make
up the diiierence, or ails order
is cancelled and deposit is for»
ieited.”

Dean Brown stated that the
activity which overspends the
most irom the amount grant-
ed irom the semester fee is
intercollegiate athletics. Last
year it was granted an $8,800
allocation, and was authorized
by the Board of Trustees to
spend $17,000. The diiierence
was made up through the re-
serve fund and other college
funds.

ln the Central committee
meeting Wednesday, a proposal
to obtain all the money from
the students themselves was de-
featcd. The $1,200 allocation was
made instead, to support the
promise made last year by the
Central committee to the Cy-
clone.
