Current campus issues have sparked some debate about the role of
students in the policy-making decisions of the college, The 5&8 wants to
draw your attention to some recent comments on the subject.

From The Dog Ate the Part We Didn‘t Like, March, 1982:

“l. , l A few years ago 7 this is not merely nostalgia — the spirit among the students oi
a conscious Grinnell College community was far stronger than it is now, People don’t have
the time for it anymore. That's a very bad sign. This semester has seen events which de-
mand student discussion, organization and outrage. We cannot receive the recent
developments concerning tenure, divestment and admissions without a significant student
response, a greater one that has been seen thus far. Frankly, the little school is in trouble
and in not too long will be molded into a school full or kids who will not only expect but acr
cept the current board of administrative behavior. ‘Grinnell Experience' will become
more of an innane slogan that it already is." ’

Klngman Brewster, former U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St.
James and former president of Yale University, discussing his policy at
that institution, April 7, 1982:

“On the student power issue, 1 took the line that socalled participatory democracy is no
way to run a university. To have students sitting on boards of trustees or sitting on laculty
committees on academic departments or academic [policies] seemed to me designed to
politicize discussion and decisions about nonrpolitical matters. And at the same time we,
along with everyone else, made a lot of advances in getting students on committees that
had to do with student life, that had to do with [student] discipline and student behavior."

Banning baking BOWIIBI‘
and MI‘. PBIIIW

, In case anyone missed the article in the Des Moines Register, the Iowa
House voted Tuesday, 97—0, to ban the manufacture, sale or possession of
simulated or imitation drugs.

Simulated drugs, also called “turkeys” by those in the know, are
defined as legal substances which are passed off as controlled
substances. Imitation drugs, on the other hand, are those legal drugs
that are packaged to look like controlled substances. These “look-alike"
drugs have the same color, shape, size and markings as hard drugs.
They usually contain a large amount of caffeine and, according to one
on—campus authority, are often presented as speed.

How effective could this bill be if it is passed, as expected, by the
Senate and signed by Governor Robert Ray? It‘s hard to patrol the i1»
legal drug trade anyway but these regulations would extend already in-
adequate enforcement efforts to cover those legal substances or drugs
which only pretend to be illegal drugs. Besides, how many victims of
“turkey” sales will report them'.7 “Officer, I want to report a case of
simulated drug abuse," a possible victin‘l might begin, “See, some per-
son who usually sells real good shit tried to pass off this baking powder
to me as cocaine. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize it until I‘d already paid
him.” So the informant winds up looking pretty stupid and receiving the
same sentence as he would have after buying a real illegal drug.

An'other side to the issue is that many people who use chemical
stimulants prefer “look—alikes.” Popular examples of these are Caf-
fedrine, shaped like a Christmas‘tree, and Mr. Peppy, which sports a
jogger on its package. Although these particular products are more
prevalent on the East Coast, there is little doubt that these types of
drugs can also be found here. ,

Since many students do, admittedly, use some illegal drugs and
assorted stimulants, we tend to hold some views about drug use which
are not consistent with the societal norm. But as State Representative

'Douglas Ritsema (Rep, Orange City), said, “These drugs get young
people used to the drug scene." If the bill does become law, we certainly
hope that trend will end. Then we’ll only need to make the older brothers
and sisters of these people more cautious about what they buy and wean
them off all these caffeine stimulants. .

Loads of fun

The iirst thing rve got to report is the
best quote I've heard all year. It was last
Monday when Monty Luzadder said, “I
guess Spring Break was designed so we
could go somewhere and have spring for
two weeks."

2 , i m to waitimvzummm i ii “more”

By writing what follows, I may be open-
ing myself up to founded accusations of be
ing frivolous but I'm kind of irritated, 80‘
here goes:

The word “Solidarity" describes the
Polish Workers‘ Union, and I wish people
would leave it that way, But everywhere I
look somebody has used this catchword of
the '30s to describe something; and usually
something that isn't solid, Like that rally
in Des Moines a few weeks ago protesting
cuts in student aid,

Solidarity is what I call an abused word.

“So what?" you're probably saying,
Well, when the word first arose in conned
tion with the Polish workers, it had meanr
mg, a sense of power. Now its weak, a
cliche. An abused word.

On the lighter side, another abused word
is “exercise," We now have dancercise,
aerobicise, jazzercise (the most painful for
met and my favorite 7 the world may not
be ready yet — Mousercise. That's right.
Mickey Mouse has his own genus of exer-
ClSe

A word that is abused by virtue of
overuse is the word “art.” If you're an art
major orjusl generally an art appreciator.
I bet I know what you're thinking. You're
saying to yourself, “That idiot, he means
modernart Buthe justdocsn’lunderstand
it, that's why he's complaining about it."
Well. I'm not. I'll let Fran Lebowitz lam-

 

poon modern art. What I'm talking about
are those massive and frequent “art
sales." You know, the guy comes on TV
talking like he was selling a veg-o-matic
from Ronco, telling about the “acres of
discounted ‘art' on sale now at the
Homewood Sheraton!" ‘

Another abused word, or rather, an

' abused idea, is generic products. It started
_. with generic drugs and has led to generic

carpet, generic books, even a generic 35
mm camera Somebody has to produce
these products, they don't just magically
appear on the shell. I get this image of the
factory where they all come from. White
with black stripes,

And while rm at it, I've heard far too
many “iok " incorporating the words
”supply side" and “trickle down.”

So, as we have child abuse, spouse abuse
and animal abuse, we have word abuse
Words and phrases are cheapened and lose

‘their meaning. They become cliches and

choke creativity, Not a major problem but
at least it's one we can all painlessly help
to eradicate,

i went to (3.0.0.0. ror two and onevhalf

questions that i wanted answered, like
“Why?” and “What does it mean when I

I looked back and decided that I wasn't ‘

any closer to my goals (or theirs), so I
stopped going,

In the last few months I have had less
group support and I have had to think
these things through on my own. here are
my conclusions: I do not like men. I like
people, or more appropriately, 1 love peer

Just happens that most of these people are
men. It isn’t their “manhood" that at-

why aren‘t I attracted to little boys or male
squirrels? I am in reality a very picky per

ing that i like “men.” the only accurate
description that I could give of myself
would be as a ”John, Thor, David, John

a Nancy thrown in for good luck, I got this
label by looking backwards into my past: I
do not know the future.

In writing “John, Thor, David, John and
