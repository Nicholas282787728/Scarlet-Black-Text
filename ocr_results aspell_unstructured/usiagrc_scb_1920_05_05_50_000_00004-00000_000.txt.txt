Miss Read Interviewed .
By the Michigan Daily

The Michigan Daily for May 1 con»
tains an interview story with Miss
Luella. .7. Read. dean or women, on self
government. The interview was ob-
tained whilc Miss Read was attending
the Women’s seli Government associa-
tion convention at Ann Arbor,

The interview follows. in part:

“I have been watching the self gov—
el'rilnent movement for several years
now,” said Miss Read, “and I am
heartily in favor of it, you may sup—
pose. Will it work? Yes. I believe
it will. However. its application and
organization must vary in different
schools. The ideal system is one or
complete student organization with the
faculty cooperation. It seems to me
that complete student government has
as many faults as complete faculty
But I am sure that a
combination or the two sources or au-
thprity is the ideal mm: of student
government. It is only when organi-
zation is complete that a heterogem
eous student body can be self gov—
ended." *

ROOM DRA‘VING NOTICE

The annual “drawing" for order oi
choice of rooms in the Quadrangle for
next year will be held about the mid-

creed for which one would live, Work
