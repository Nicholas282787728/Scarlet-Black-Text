LAST lﬂWN DRIVE-FUR

Workers to Dine at, Dorms This
Evening and Plan Campaign
For Final RoundUp,

A whirlwind drive tomorrow is ex-
pected to bring the town campaign for
college endowment funds to the goal
of $125,000 and to close the campaign
in town, according to plans of the
Computer til club committee. About
seventyefivc men have been organized
into teams to canvass the residence
districts and the individuals who are
thought to be in a position to sub,
scribe to the funds.

A big pep meeting will be held to—
night in the dining room at the dor—'
rnitorles, when the teams will meet
to discuss plans at dinner, and to»
marrow the drive will begin.

Extensive advertising and publicity
work has preceded the campaign, and

of the plans of the committees. The
pledges now stand. at $78,000, which
is $47,000 short of'the goal set at the
beginning of the Campaign. Eighty-
six busrhess and professional men
are on the list of subsCribers who
have pledged the $78,000. The cum-
mittee declares that there are still
over 600 citizens in Gi‘innell who are
able to make pledges, and it hopes to
put the total amount raised by to»
rnorrow night well above the 3125,1100
goal.

The names of the men on the teams
were not ready to announce today.
Reverend E. W. Cross, Mr. C. S.
George, president of the Commercial
club, and a number of other prominent
business men are working with the
college endowment headquarters on
the drive. Prof. F. F. Alrny is at the
head of the Poweshlek County terri-
tory.

Neva Hoyt, assisted by Grace Scary,
violinist, gave a piano recital at Her-
l'lck chapel lsst night. Her program
was well given and well received by
the audience.

Special Stunts Planned Leave Friday Night For.
For Fourteenth An- Clash With Pikers—
nual Appearance. Dope Favorable.

The Plolleer track sound will lcztve
Griuliell Friday evening for st. Louis
where they will meet Washington
University in a dual met on Satur-
day- altornoon. The local squad ap-
pears in the host of condition wrtlrl
the exception of Fiiulu who rs both-
ered with a slight cold. However
nothing has happened that will seri-
ously impair the speed of the Grinncll
marvel.

By using the results of the Drake-
Washington dual and the DrakerGI-in-
ncll dual it looks as if G-rlnnell would
have little difficulty in winning the
meet. Drake disposed of Washington
handily and Gl'inrrell did not have
serious trouble with the Bulldogs so
the outlook is favorable for Coach
Huff's men.

Should llnko Ilcluy

Paulu will undoubtedly win his
races but it seems likely that Drake
of Washington will finish second in
the 100 but if wright runs the 220 he
stands an excellent chance of soorrng
a second place for Griunell. In short
Griuliell stands its best chances on
the track while Washington is excepr
tionally strong in the field events.
noth relays should go to Grinnell
without any trouble as Drake won
both of them in their dual with the
St. Louis school.

Unless something very unexpected
happens the Pioneers should return
(mm the south with a victory by at,
least a margin of eighteen points for
the meet appears about the same as
the Drake dual last Saturday.
