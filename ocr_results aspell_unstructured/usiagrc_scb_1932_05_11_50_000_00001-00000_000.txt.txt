prize by opening a book in the library
shortly before the affair,

The Derby was then gravely pre-
sented to Mr. Alexander.

Helen Parzybok. house chairman of
Cottage Three, was the recipient of
the Derby's running mate, the Brown
Bonnet. The Kite, for the senior
"with the biggest line” went to Man
guerite (Mickey) McFarlin, another
of the public speaking, debating ilk.

Charles Van Slyke, “Mexican lathe
lets do luxc,” received the Leather
Medal for his torcador activi ,es. The
Green Gloves, for the male sophisti-
cate, went to John Lund, blonde vik-
ing from thc onion fields of St. Ans»

21 when Creighton will be host to
the annual Missouri Valley conference
outdoor meet. Coach Franklin P.
(Pitch) Johnson’s wellebalanced
squad will defend its championship.
The Bulldogs won both the indoor
and outdoor crowns last year. No in-
door mect was held during the past
winter.

It is practically assured that But-
ler univcrsity of Indianapolis, Ind,
latest addition to the valley circuit,
will be representcd at the track meet.
If so, the Bulldogs of Indianapolis are
doped to give the Bulldogs of Des
Moincs the strongest sort of competi-

Actors Go Uncroppe

d for Art’s) Sake;

Growing Locks in Shakespearean Play

By LILLIE HAGAN

“There's many a slip
’Twixt the hair and a clip!”

More truth than fiction, as seven
of the mnsculinc members of the cast
for “The Merchant of Venice" will
aver. Not the depression, but Art
(All, yaas, Artl) is responsible for
the longhaired condition of these
would-be Shakespearean players.

They may look a little fringy above
the collars now, but here the old
adage about building Rome applicsi
for in two more wccks thc shaggy
chrysalis will break open, and out
will pop seven of the gayest young
bloods that ever disported on a Grin—
nell college campus (or the stage of
the Alumni Recitation hall auditor-
ium).

Howard Warrington. who now ap-
pears just another unkempt book
store clerk, will then strut forth as
the proverbial tnll, dark and hand-
some Eassaniosand the fair Portia's
heart will skip a beat as She spies the
tantalizing curls clustered at the
hope of her lover's neck. Music is not
the only thing which hath charm:

Antonio, that unselfish merchant of
Venice. will, in the poison of Guil-
ford Collison, rival the charms of
Bassanio; and the appeal of the fair
haired Lorenzo will be irresistible to
Jessica when She beholds his new

coiffurc.

“Killer” Brown (Robert M), as
Gratiano. will undoubtedly cause a
coup dc theatre when he makes his
appearance on the stage. if his pres-
ent lrirsuteness gives any indication
of thc finishcd product. Donald Ross,
as the tall and lanky Salarino. should
easily prove box»office caliber, and
blond Irwin 0xley, cssaying the role
of Salonio, will reap the rewards for
his weeks of conscientious negligence
to his crowning glory.

AS Launcelot Cohbo, Maurice Bird
sall will have the chance to display the
new length of his curly locks in his
gambols and frolicking stage antics.

The modern haircut may have its
merits, but for romance and glamour
nothing can equal the uncroppcd locks
of the masculine actors of Shaker
speare’s day, And when “The Mer-
chnnt of Venice" is rcvivcd by the
drama department ncre less than two
weeks hcncc, these seven exponents
of his art will have become so much
attached to their new necklines that
a severance will cause them to feel
much a; Samson did when shorn by
Delilahiand in sornc cases the fix-
ation may he so great that their bare
hers will suffer a permanent loss of
trade, while Mrs. Sara Sherman
Pryor, director of drama, may gain
new “feminine" leads for her next
year's productions.
