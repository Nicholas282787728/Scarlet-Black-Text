WHY BLAME THE ADMDIISTRATION?

ll is argued that ti‘iinnell student. govern-
ment is not all that it is represented to be. It
is rumored that our college administr ion is
ready, 'Zlilllln’ hopefully to Spring forth and
stamp out any new and progressive ideas which
the students may llring forth to better thenr
icivo‘. It is rumored that Studen cannot stop
either backwards or forwards l (hunt being
liable to censorship by college oifit‘idls.

One of the favorite pastimes of Grinncll
Students is to criticize everything on the campus
without offering any constructive ideas for sull-
stillltion.

Dear Mr. Hunn,

In response to the recent series of editorials in
regard to the pep situation at Grimell, it seems

Grinnell Herold, Telephone 241.’

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

that it is only fair for us to present our side of
the problem.

First of all, the reason that there were no cheer-I

leaders at the first home basketball game is that.
there is only one yell leader who has not resigned or
who is still eligible. The question of eligibility is
not fax us to discuss; but the resignations of our
three key men, we feel was in part justifiable, due
to the apparenL lock of student cooperation.

These men had been serving without reward;
they had Constantly been subjected to the severest
criticism, notably by people who made no effort to
even recognize their attempts.
only natural.

There are two alternatives. We Shall either be
forced to discontinue the function of the Student
Council pep committee and the nctivitics of yell
leaders, or, under the present Strained atmosphere,
try to prevail upon some college men to undertake

these jobs Without hope of recognition or apprecia-
tion.

There is also the matter of the attempt to
organize pep functions, such as programs, parades
and tea dances. The students may be interested to
know that after the small burn-out for the torch-
light psi-ode, there were over 200 torches unused. At
a recent pcp program 76 persons ottcnded, despite
all the publicity that was possible; and we were
subjected to the unfortunate embarrassment of intro-
ducing Capt. Jim Bradley and "Scotty" McLeod to
this small group on the eve of Grinnell’s final game.
That there have been negligible numbrs turn out
for what might have been good tea dances, is another
notable instance of the obvious indifference of the
student body. Another difficulty is presented by
the unwillingness of talented students to participate
in thcse meetings.

What. we definitely want to know is this: if
the students wish to continue in their present
apathetic state, and never back any pep activity
on this campusidespite a basketball team that
clearly demonstrated in its first game that it war-
rants the support of every Studentithen we feel
that there is nothing for us to do but "toss in the
towel," and forget that there ever was any Grinnell
Spirit If this attitude is prevalent, we want people
to admit it, so wc may at least feel that we have
not been entirely to blame.

Sincerely yours,

LORRAINE BUCKMAN.
JOHN SPENCE.

Other Opinions

TAKE THIS PLEDGE
(Doily O'Colleginn)

The Hartford Times, Hartford, Conn. last sum»
mer started a campaign to put on end to reckless
driving in the state of Connecticut,

The paper first started by asking all its ems
ployees to take a. pledge. The pledge was printed in
the paper and thousands of people in Connecticut
took it. An improvement was immediately noticed.
The pledge has sincc been adopted in toto by nus
merous other newspapers in thc United States.

We print the pledge below and suggest that you
drivers cut it out and paste it on your windshield as
a constsnt reminder.

“I am making the following pledge;

1. To drive at o moderate speed in my proper
traffic lane or on my own side of the road.

2 Not to pass cars or other vehicles on curves
or hills

3. To stop at stop signs.

4, Not to jump traffic signals,

5. To be particularly Watchful for pedestrians
stepping into traffic from parked cal: 01‘ from be-
hind psrked cars,

6. Always to hand signal showing intention of
turning left, right, or stopping, and not to leave
curb without looking and giving Slgnal.

7. To refrain from reckless driving.

8 To be fair to other drivers in all respects.”

We wonder how many auto fatalities there
would bc if this pledge we constantly kept in mind
by drivers?
