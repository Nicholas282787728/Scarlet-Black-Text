‘AIDOS’

”The Greeks had it word for it.” Catch-phrase
though it is, the statement is stnnling in its truth.
\Vllat modern peoples attempt to exprcs ' compli
cated paragraphs and long, unruly defilii oils, the
Greeks often expressed in a single word.

There is, for instance. the word, “Aides,”
which has never been translated satisfactorily in
modern languages. To the Greek, Aidos was the
quality which prevented SI, man from “carrying ll
thing too for.” It was on inner feelinginot per-
sonified, but a vague reality—that made a man
Stop and think, “what is this leading to?”

Aidos might be interpreted, a bit facetiously,
as the quality hicll enables a salesmztn to l“ ow
wllen he has said exactly enough without sa_ 'ng
too much, or all author when he has written exacts
1y enough without over-writing. It is the balance
between sclf~restraint and initiative. It has some;
thing of finesse and tact 31nd technique in it as
well as a sense of decency and honor. One modern
interpreted it as “walking delicately.”

It is something to thinl about when onc‘s
career is considered. The sensi vc ability to ”see”
the effect before there is cause has won not only
kingdoms and fortunes, but oftentimes, and what
is more illiportont—llltppincss.

 

 

 

 

HIGH SPIRITS

Spirit was high at last night’s game. Not only
was the affair thrilling—as well as dishearteningi
but Grilluell students maintained the excitement
at a high pitch by their continuous cheering. As
members of tho pep committee of the student comb
cil, Mark Trumbull and Betty Adams deserve much
credit for their efforts of the past several weeks.
Cheer leaders should come in for their share of the
applause, also,

The remark was made at Thursday evening’s
pep meeting that if Grinnell did not will the State
Teachers-game, the Pioneer players might as well
turn in their suits. While meant in the light that
the Pioneers would strain every effort to defeat
the invaders, the speaker did not intent! that his
remark should be taken literally.

For Grinnell played i1 grand game. Its tcani
outgained the winners nearly three-to»one, as so
often happens in upset defects. The Tutors played
heads-up ball, taking advantage of the brehks, and
punting often to rest their hall-carriers. The Pio-
neers can still furnish the toughest sort of opposi-
tion to the teams on the balance of their scllcdulc#
even to the overweight Billiliens of St. Louis.

G
TELLING THE CROWD

The public-address system inaugurated at foot-
ball games this fall h . been mentioned before in
the editorial columns. At that time, the statement
was made that fans do not appreciate verbal adver-
tisements for various firms at the moment when
forward passes are being completed or when a
touchdown is being made.

Now we rise to say that unless more effort is
made to give accurate information, this address sys»

 

 

touchdown, than to be told definitely that it was
Rilskow'tz, when as a matter of fact, Clancy did
the toting.

And lost, biased remarks ill favor of the homo
team and [sections comments are entirely out of

order ill such an address system.

PEP Dli‘rl’ltlt‘.SSION'.7

Grillnoll college, the oldest coeducational ill-
stimtion west of the Mississippi, has apparently
fallen into a lapse of spirit (luring the last few
years. We have always hoard much about the
strong loyalty mid virile clitllu Sm of tho Grin»
llcll student body, and have been rather surpl- ed,
since coming here, to note the more or less lnlic
“ull'm attitude which seams to exist.

It is hard to plllcc it finger on just what has
happened in Grillllell to so greatly chlmgc its \l‘zll'm
unity of competitive spirit, although the results
of this unseen fol-co have been apparent, most
prominently at sporting contests,

School loyalty and spir is not it thing that
can be stored in o box and brought out for on
hiring by the presence of it cliccr leader or two,
but it must be nu ingrained quality ill the very
heart of the student body. It, is as deep seated as
the traditions of a college mid something compar-
illlle to that sort of patriotism that causes men to
give up their lives.

Has Gl-ilillcll lost its traditional and fitmi‘d
collcgc spirit, or are we suffering, along with the
World at large, it pep depression?

Other Opinions

wrrn FINGERS onossnn

(The Creightonlnn)

The attitude of the American press toward the
National Recovery plan is a paradoxical one. Newspaper
publishers who are Willing to devote thousands of col-
umns to NRA publicity often are unwilling to admit
that their editoxial staffs should come under its pro~
visions on the grounds that newspaper reporters and
desk workers are professional men.

That journalism should be a. profession is one of
the most sought after goals of newspaperdom. Yet there
are certain conditions under which the present—day
newspaper is published that make this impossiblE. Pro-
fessionalism implies a. freedom of action that no news—
paperman on the lower rung of the ladder can possess.
In the city editor, he has an exacting dictatorial boss
or, in the case of the deskrnan, an all-powered chief of
the copy desk. Unlike professional men, he finds his
work may be altered or discarded seeming to the judg-
ment of his superiors.

As far as the organization of the newspaper office
is concerned, the average newspaper man is in much
the same situation as a, common laborer. In intelligence
and trainnig he must be superior to the average skilled
laborer yet he rarely receives either the remuneration
or the respect due a workman in the higher trades.

But newspaper publishers, through their natlonal
organizations, have for years fought the formation of
newspapermen's unions. They have called them pro-
fessionsl men and treated them like laborers.

Under the National Recovery Act the right of
laborers to organize for eollective bargaining has been
established. The problem of the newspaperman's status
must be settled soon and from the struggle going on
at present the settlement will probably be a compromise

Three hundred New York newspapermen have
formed 2. union under the NRA, The Associated Press,
grand and conservative old lady that she is, reports
that they have formed a, "guild." However fine the
distinction may seem to the layman, it is a definite
one to newspapermen. it means that under the new
regime the old guard has not relaxed 'its vigilance
against unionism and that, with all fingers crossed,
the newspapermsn is a professional men.

OBITUARY

(Dally Northwestern)

The time seems to have come for us to publiely de-
plore the passing on or a grand old tradition. Any nlum
strolling about South campus today, would no doubt be
horrified at the sight of the bland, green-capped laddlos
who defiantly walk to end from classes putting away
at eigerets and pipes,

This tradition, moreover, dld not die a. peaceful
death, but was most foully and shamefully murdered.
And the least we can do is to wax elegiae on a. post-
mortend.

We know who started itithe women! Ever since
Deering library first opened, our ear-tamed coeds have
openly defied its pseudo-Gothic facade with the use oi
the loathsome weed, And then, the first dastardly blow
having been struck, they smoked all over the campus.
The mentolks are gradually and timidly following the
horrid example.

So light up, boys and girls. Our late tradition, pur-
posely or not, has been omitted irorn this year's N<Book.
Momvlt!

Notice the Spots on

Last night at the dance—
were they grinning behind your
back at your clothes? Did your
partner notice the spot on your
collar? Is that what he was

staring at?

Get rid of that terrible selfr
conscious feeling once and for
all. It costs so little to keep
your clothes spick and span,
cleaned and pressed. Send them

regularly then let ’em stare.—
