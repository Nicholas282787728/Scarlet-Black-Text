Hi+ 'em Again . . . .

Every holy and then we are asked to
contribute money or tinle or clothes for
someone else. Most of lls rise to the occasion
with a noble, sacrificial attitude and add our
dime, our half hour, or our oldest, dirty
sweater, and we feel that through our ef-
forts the world has been made a truly better
place in which to live. This week, however;
we have a chance to make a unique kind of
sacrifice. This week we can sacrifice for

‘ ourselves.

' In every cottage there is a representative
of the committee for the World Student
Service Fund who will expect each person
in the hall to pledge $3 for world student
relief. As educated persons, we realize the
worth of ,welledirected sacrifice, although
few of us really stop to think of the actual
purpose. Greek War Relief is just three
euphonious words. We do not number star-
ving Greeks among our acquaintances, and
war relief is a term which has been lldied
about so much that it has lost sign ance;
consequently, our vague interest in such a
Citllse is understandable although not excus-
21 e.

But all of us are students, and as sucll
we know first hand the problems of fi~
Dancing an education. Some of us would
not have had the opportunity to come to
college had it not been for far-sighted and
generous individuals who, although they
did not know us personally, took enollgll
interest in the future of the world to pro-
vide with their own resources for our edu-
cation. Call we deny to students even more
needy than we the privilege granted to us”.I

There are others of lls who came to
school under no financial obligations what—
soever. We shall never know quite what
at is to love learning so passionately that
one is forced to give up home and family
and security in order to pursue it, as has
been the case wvith Chinese students for
many years. We have never had to share
a book with forty other students nor live
from one day to the next on nothing but
bread and water.

It sounds melodramatic, and it is. It is
also true. We are all too prone, in our
smug, collegiate sophistication, to make fun
of anything with which we are not ac-
quainted and which smacks of fundamental
human tragedy. We have acquired the
collegiate perspective whichsee the rest of
the world as a sort of movie, interesting but
not to be taken too seriously.

the

situation. There are students all over the
world who need aid so desperately that it
is criminal of us to withold it. The Grinnell
WSSF drive should net more this year than
ever before since its inception. To be sure,
Grillnell has done a very commendable job
in the past. For the last two years we have
gone well over our quota, which has been a
higll one in proportion to the number of
students in the school. We have out-contrh
buted any school of our size in Iowa and
many which are larger than Glinnell. We
have ranked high nationally, and we have
been considered all enlightened and unsel-
fish institution.

For this we have received all sorts of
praise and recognition. We have become
rather complacent, and although every year
there is much grumbling, each of us, in the
end, manages to turn over $3. We are very
self sacrificing and most worthy of praise.

This is a new year, and it is time to
think before we give. This year we need
not be unselfish. This year we can not be
noble. This year we are giving a necessity
ito ourselves.

other rarities made their bows at meals
other than Sunday dinner, we sighed come

Poin’rs For Students - -

Next semester will mark the initiation
of a point system to distribute more widely
campus offices and activities. In response
to customary gripes of stud ts not directly
concerned with college acti, ies as well as
those of individual students who have been

.burdelled by too many major or minor

offices, a Student Council committee drew
up tlle experimental plan proposed this
week.

In actual practice, however, the point
system will effect little change in the nor»
lnal operations of student organizations.
There has always been a regulating system
obtaining under jurisdiction of the Student
Organization Committee. This is a , int
faculty-student committee, with student re-
presentation appointed by the Student
Council, headed by Evelyn Gardner, dean of
women. The new system merely codifies
and makes available to students these spe-
cific rules, thus enabling the committee to
arbitrate more effectively. - .

Classification of major and minor actie
vities into three groups was based as much
upon their prestige as upon the actual time
they required. A careful study of the pro—
posed list may reeval seeming injustices
and onllnissions. This is, however, an ex;
perimental grouping; only until it is in
operation can its weaknesses be discovered.

Athletic, dramatic, and musical activities
will be rated individually according to facts
involved—though it seems to the S. & B.
that varsity athletics require a three point
rating. Any student may request more
activities by petitioning the committee for
eligibility over the five point limit, subject
to the discretion of the committee

The whole point system idea has received
varying reactions from students questioning
its necessity. It is, however, a step in the
direction of the democracy that has been
the Grinnell Traditioniwhether it is a
necessary step, next semester’s trial may

. prove.

Now, exiled to the home of
Prof. Jorge Chavarrl, oppoSlte the
campus, Herman bears no grudge.
His lively interest in the students
and their} activities is Still
apparent. 'Butino more can
Herman sit in on the nightly bull
sessions. No more can Herman
attend classes.

Now, after three years in col—
lege have made him a quiet well-
, bred dog, the learning accumulat~
ed during the last three years is
apparent in his hearing and men.
And, although he will not be in
the centennial graduating class,
Ille has his memories.

When he entered in the fall of
,1942, no one was prone to pay
.much attention to this meek little
‘dog. Thus it was that Herman
wandered around from building
to building, and from tree to
tree, looking lost and alone, be-
fore he won a friend. In this
manner, Herman started his long
and steady climb to becoming a
,culturcd, couth, and educated
ldog.

‘He‘hsd to be told only once
not to enter the dining room.
,Nevcr did he venture past the
door, but would lie on the rug,
and await his friends there.

His unly canine companion his
first year was Thurman. The
contrast between these two was
amazing. Thurman, the rah-rah
‘boy, knew his power, and dropped
his favors accordingly.

When Herman returned for his
second year, refreshed
vacation, not only was Thurman
missing, but also many of his
friends from the year before. The
boys had gone off m we

‘class attcndence record was regur

events the college had tn offer.

At the concert of Anne Brown,
noted soprano, to show his appre-
ciation of her line voice and his
good will, he accompanied her to
the stage, and remained [hi-re
throughout the whcle perforr
mance. No amount of persuasion
could bring him down.

for formals, and usually managed
to send her ﬂowers.

Determined to take advantage
of the full liberal arts curriculum,
Herman took more than the
alloted four major courses. Pro-
fessors pretended not to notice if
Herman commented cn their lec-
turcs by falling asleep,

His only difficulty came in the
International Relations and Earn
eign Trade course, where Pro-
fessor Earl D. Strong's Mitzi
brooked no interference or canine
competitors.

Returning as a junior, Herman
found only twenty-five men for,
him to live with, but some of his
old friends came back on military
leaves.

At the end of his junior year,
Prof. Jorge Chavarri offered to
take care of him over the sum—
mer. Herman figured this would
be a fine time tn learn to speak
Spanish fluently, and further Pan-
American relations. It was a
happy summer.

Then the blow fellzz

No dogs allowed in or on college
property! Herman was crushed!
Where would he go? What would
he do?

Mr. and Mr's. Chsysrri were
sympathetic and offered their
home to Herman. He could stay
there and still see his old friends.
Herman thought this over and Ge
clued they were right. Though
Ahe wouldlrt be able to finish his
Economics major, he would be
sble to forge ahead in Spanish.

Students began arri ng, and
[Herman and the Chavarris were
