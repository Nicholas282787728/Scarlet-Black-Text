(Evil-aria!

x view oi the merit oi last lliglli/s
lecture and the worthiness oi
the cause ior which it was giveuit
’is to be sincerely regretted that any
combination oi circumstances should
arise to keep the size oi the audience
down to two tliiids oi a room iiill.
To the mind oi Scanner Axn BLACK
as an interested observer too little
account is taken oi general college
events when individuals and organiza—
tions are planningr [or entertainments
oi their own. Nothing is so evident
as theueces orco-operation atiowa
College or that cooperation is impos—
siblewheu the iorces oi the illstitur
tion are assembled in dilierent places
tor diil'erent purposes. Let us make
it a poli 'n the iutnre not only to be
sorry that it seems most ,conrenient
to hold our social iunctions at times
when events or more general concern
are on but to avoid coniliots entirely.
A little thoughtinlness along this line
will mean uincli to causes in which we
are all interested.

HE beginning oi the ioiirth week

in January is surely not too
earlya date for young men to corn-
nnence thinking about what they are
to do February 9712 in regard to the
State Convention 01' the Y. M. c. n.
which will be held at that time in
Muscatine Not long ago there was
printed in this paper a sketch oi seine
oi the things concerning the neurons
tion and alist oi the attractions in
will lhtl'e to mm in the way or spealc
ers. Thelist promised much tor the
strength or the programme and the
enjoyableness or the occasion but ac-
cording to the unanimous testimony
of those who at other times hare
attended siieli gatherings there is
something else to be obtained there
which is even deeper in signiﬁcance
than the inilneiice or such men as will
address the state convention. This
something is the unique inspiration

which comes to a man in the presence
oi hundreds oi his iellows when all are
bounrl together by a common purpose.
ii one is looking ror new enthusiasm
in Christian work there is no place
where he will be more likely to ﬁnd it
than at the )[uscatille convention
