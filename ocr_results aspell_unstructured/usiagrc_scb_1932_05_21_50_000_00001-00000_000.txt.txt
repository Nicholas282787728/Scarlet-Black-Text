Merchant Of Venice Delights Audience;

Portia Foils Money Grabbing Shylock?

By a Staff Reporter
lfiil direction, forccful charlie»
tcr .ation, effectivc scenery, soft
lighting. and beautiful costumes
marked the successful reincarnation
of William Shakespeare's comedy
“The Merchant of Venice," presented
by the department of drama, under
the direction of Mrs. Sara Sherman
Pryor, in Alumni Recitation hall
auditorium Thursday and Friday
nights and at a matinee this after-
noon. The play will again be givcn
at commencement time.

George 0. Seiver, professor of
French, portrayed the role of Shyr
lock, the Jew, with artistic case and
distinction, His sympathetic charan
terization and masterly handling of
a difficult part was thc high spot of_
the performance. Particularly effec-
tive was his rendition of the famous
passage, “Hath not a Jew eyes 7" and
his brilliant acting in the courtroom
scene of act IV redeemed a relative-
ly weak scene.

Antonin Docs “'91!

A speaking voice of rare musical
quality distinguished Antonio, . the
merchant of Venice, played by Guil-
ford Collison. He carried his tall,
commanding figure with poise and
grace, and his stage appearances
were invariably rlominating.

As the fair-haired Portia, heiress
of Belmont, Faith Somcrs was both
charming and convincin". Her most
effective portrayal was in the last
act. where her coquctry and use of
feminine wiles drew an appreciative
response from the audience.

Fern Hulsebus as Nerissa, Portia-s
friend and confidante. was girlishly
sweet and appealing. Her scenes with
the clever and inimitable Gratiano,
played by Robert M. Brown, were
well taken.

Goblin the Clown

An outstanding and particularly
effective performance was given by
Maurice Birdsall, as Launcelot Gobbo,
the Clown. His interpretation was
highly entertaining, and his amusing
stage antics captured the enthusias-
tic approval of the on-lookcrs.

Howard Warrington, who portray»
ed the gallant and handsome Bas-
sanio, gave an excellent pcrformarice
throughout, but was especially not—
able in the casket scene. His roman-
tic air and dignified bearing, when
combined with the soft strains of
‘:Tell me where is fancy bred" made
this scene almost irresistible in its
appeal,

Jessica Rcliels

Shylonk’s rebellious daughter, Jes»
sica, was aptly played by Roberta
Vance. Her elopcment with the grace-
ful Lorenzo, interpreted by Chi
Rhynsburgel', was another effcctivc
spot in the presentation.

A minor part was given import-
ance and character by Mason Meyer
as old_ Gobho. In a piercing falsetto

at ChapelFriday

Frederick Baumann, associate pro-
fessor of history, delivered an ad'
dress on the importance of the indie
vidual in the modern world. at the
second senior chapel services. held
yesterday morning.

“The end of society,” Mr. Baumann
said, ”15 in the individual. The society
of the world cannot be resolved into
standardized individuals, The coming
world order will be an internation so-l
ciety of distant personalities."

“Society," he added. "can only give
a favoring environment; the rules of
the game, Achievement must come
from within individuals. Machines
can neither make men had nor good:
‘men do that themselves. Machines can
and will release individuals of spirit
through collectivism of things.” l

“The difficulty,” he said, “is not inl
making changes in the world. but in
securing recognition of the changes

‘vision and courage necessary to rec-
ognize changes in oneself is essential
to an ability to recognize changes in
the world order.
, problem is in ones self."
