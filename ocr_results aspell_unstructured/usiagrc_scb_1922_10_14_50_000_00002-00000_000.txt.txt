Few of us realize the “quiet beauty"
of the Criuncil Campus: the shrubs
around the A. R. H. and the dormi—
tories, the clump of birches in thc
center campus, the south campus with
its evergreens and drooping birchos.
and the vines on the association
building and Al R. H. But when we
see other campuses we unconsciously
compare them with our own, and it
is then that we appreciate the natural
beauty with which we are slirroundcd.

New buildings add considerably to
the beauty of the campus when they
are artistically planned, but buildings
won't stay new and others Can‘L he
added at random. However there.is
a beauty in old buildings which m-ows
with age and which money canot buy,
That is the beauty and richness of
associations and memories.

We, in Gidnheii, have an optimistic
outlook for the tnture. We have visions
at new buildings and new hopes but
this outlook depends largely upon
money. We cannot have them unlll

' we have the money. But we can make

our. present equipment appear better.

Editor, Scarlet and Black;

Thcrc appeared in the last issue at
the Scarlet and Black a communica-
tion signed by Dr. E. A. Steiner on the
general topic or the wearing or caps
by the Freshmen men, he being of the
opinion that the cutorcelnent oi such
a practise by the upper-classmcn is
undemocratic m sp with this

w I heartily disagree.

There is perhaps no drier way in
which to unity the Freshmen class
than by that very means. The scarlet]
and black cap is one unquestionable
mark by which all \i1)pel‘~cl:lssmen
and taculty recognize the Freshmen,
and in addition, a point more imporr
tant, it is a mark by which the Fresh-
men recognize one another.

Now what could possibly be a more
enjoyable sight tor any school than
that attor-ded,by the Freshmen in
their "button drill" at the Parsons

PRFPPING

The Scarlet and Black declines to
engage discussion
through i -
the merits or dcmcrlts ot the system
or prepping as practiced in Grinncll;
but the what Do You Think column
is open to anyone who has anything
to otter on the subject. There are
two points at view, one ct which was

in any further
editorial columns as to

set torth in a communication from
Dr. steincr in our last issue, and the
other 01' which is advocated in two
articles today.

In order, however, that the readers
at the Scarlet and Black might not be
led to bclieve that there is as strong
oposition to the custom as some
people might have its believe, we are
today publishing several interviews
with taculty men and with prominent

{reshmem We also publish the re—

never investigated the psychology ot‘
the stiff cullztl' and the silk hat, of
the Saint] fork and the rituals connec-
ted with the Reception and the Pink
Tea, but if I did I should expect light
to be tin-own on the mystery ot the
Freshman Cap. The Cap is really only
one small detail in a whole complex.
The cullege is a. community. Its cus-
toms every graduate looks back to
with reminiscent amusement and Elf—
tcction. They are no more foolish than
cigars and state dinners, and ftu‘ richer
in agrccilllle associations. Tu defy
them is to occasion surprise, derision,
irritationpeven thundcrhoits, to no
purpose Whatever, If I were a Fresh-
man, I should wear the Cap mast
punctiliously and keep it, expecting to
take it out over and anon attire age of
seventy and look at it
wishing I could turn the clock back
and wear it again.

I do not Wish, of Course, to lie mis~
understand. In the Case that hits oc-
casioned this discussion I do not an-
prove of the method by which our
over vubcrant Freshmen signiﬁed
their disapproval 01‘ one man's nim-
conformity. For that matter, if it were
put to the Vote, I have no doubt that
the students 01‘ this College would ht:
quite unanimous against any kind ot
mob action, besides, the disapproval
was in this case much too violently
expressed. But that does not justify

which has Just been published, has

leading Celtic Scholars. More than
the rcsult of carotid investigations, it
has a charm of narrative that will
make it appeal to all layers of ancient
story, of history and of poetiy. In
his book, Mr. O’Conor “does far more
than give American readers all idea
of Irish spiritual bealit he has
created through interpretation a thing

up the retelling at the ancient tales
with a spirit closely akin to that at
their original creators."

Fur ten years M . O’Conor has lived
in Boston devoting his attention to
writing. For the past three or tour
years he has lectured upon Irish liter-
ature and road troln his own work
at many clubs, colleges and universi-
ties. His books are used in the
course in Irish litcraturc given at the
Univer ity or Chicago, his verse has
appeared in many magazines and
anthologies, and he has lately achievA
cc considerable reputation as a critic
not only or Irish literature but of
poetry in general. Mr. O’Conor is a
member oi the Poetic society or
America, a former Vice President and
member of the board or the New Eng-
land Poetry Club, and a member or
the Irish Texts Society. He is one of

oldest Irish literary society in the
British Isles.

Mr. O'Cnnor expressed some hesi—
mncy in making statement at
opinion ,conceruing Grinnell attairs
after so short a stay here. “I like the
atmosphere and the attitude at the stir
dents and I'm having a very pleasant

that it offers the opportunity to get
