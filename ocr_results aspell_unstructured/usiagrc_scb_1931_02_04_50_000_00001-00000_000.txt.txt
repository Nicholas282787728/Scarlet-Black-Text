MILWAUKEE 7 Marquette uni-
versity football men succeeded in
breaking the old Grinnell college
jinx last fall, and Coach Bill Chand-
ler‘s Blue and Gold basketeers hope
to keep in stride here Saturday
night, when they battle the Pioneer
cagemen in the Hilltop gymnasium

Chandler, the for-
mer all western ace
at Wisconsin and,
later coach at Io
wa State for seven
years, is just a bit
wary about the
coming engagement.
however. John
Truesdale's scarlet-
clad athletes appar-
ently have consid».
erable class this‘CH NDIER—
season, and the local coach realizes
his quintet must be at peak form for
the engagement.

Win Over Detroit, 35 to 22

Victories over Brigham Young and
Wisconsin have high-lighted the Mar-
quette campaign thus far, though
none of the Hilltop victories has been
by decisive scores.

Following is the record: Marquette
27, Milwaukee Teachers 19; Mar—
quette 15. Illinois Wesleyan 11;
Marquette 18. Pittsburgh 24; Mar—
quette 35. Brigham Young 31; Mar-
quette 16, Wisconsin 14: Marquette
20. Chicago 28; Marquette 16. Michi-
gan State 19; Marquette 26, Uni—
versity of Detroit 21: Marquette 23,
Notre Dame 30; Marquette 22,
Creighton 18: Marquette 18, Law-
rence 14. and Marquette 35, Univelu
sity of Detroit 22.

In his first year at Marquette
Chandler found four veterans around
whom to build his team. and all of
them are seeing action regularly.
When the season opened. the new
Hilltop coach feared that center was
to be his weak point. but as matters
have turned out. the tipoff is his key
position. Walter “Whitey" Budruoas,
lanky Waukegan, m., boy who won
his letter last year but was under-
study to Roy Andrew. has come
through in fine fashion.

'Pioneers Lose Conference
Game to Drake Team;

Trouuce Aggies

Ry KEN CLAYTON
(Campus Editor, Scarlet and Black)

CEDAR RAPIDS—Ben Douglas,
toweheaded Cedar Rapids athlete.
came home Monday night and
brought with him a Scarletrclad
basketball team from Grinnell col-
loge to meet the local Kohawks. That
quintet dashed its way to an 11-
point lead in the ﬁrst half, and had
little trouble in downing the Coe col-
lege aggregation, 30 to 22.

The Pioneers led all the way after
the ﬁrst few minutes of play, when
the score was once tied, 5 to 5. At
half-time the visitors held a 19-8
edge on the Kohawks.

Kee Lends Coo Rally

“Hank” Duncan‘s hook shots and
Douglas‘ straight tosses from for out
on the floor had the local outfit be—
wildered throughout the ﬁrst half,
while those plays that did sift past

were rendered ineffectual by poor

shooting.

Douglas kept Kee. stellar coe for-
ward thoroughly covered until late in
the game, when the Kohawk regis-
tered 10 points and led a rally that
brought cheers from the fans, even
though it failed to cut the Grinnell
margin to less than six points at any
time.

All Free Throws Made

The Pioneer cagers, evidently con—
ﬁdent of their early lead, played
sluggish ball in the second half and
failed to work the ball through the
Coe defense as they had succeeded in
doing in the ﬁrst half.

Both teams showed some poor
shooting from the ﬂoor, and the Coc
men lost several chances from the
free-throw line. Grinnell players had
only four gratis shots, and made all
of these good for points.

Oklahoma Aggies
Surprised, 26-19

With “Hank” Duncan, Grinnell's
star forward, making eight ﬁeld
goals. the Pioneer basketball tcam
pulled out of a two week slump here
Friday night to take revenge on the
Oklahoma Aggie oagers, 26 to 19, in
the last of a series of ﬁve Missouri

MOUNT VERNON Although
Cornell college freshmen basketball
players lost a close game to the year-
lings of Iowa State Teachers college
last week, it has not hampered their
daily preparation for the Grinnell
college invasion Friday afternoon.

The Little Purple quintet suffered
a severe blow when Van Vleet, high
scoring guard, failed to return to
school the second semester. Due to
his absence, Coach Judd Dean has
shifted the lineup considerably in an
effort to find the best possible com»
bination.

It is expected that Pulliam will

Marquette Duo

Wins Decision
in Debate Here

Singer, Hawk Upheld Case
for Grinnell in Dual

on Chain Stores

Marquette university debaters,
Hugo Hellman and Louis Stauden«
maier, of Milwaukee, Wis.. present-
ed the best argument and evidence
in the MarquetterGr‘lnnell debate on
chain stores here last night. in the
belief of Prof. Earl S, Kelp, presi-
dent of Iowa Association of Speech
Teachers, who criticised the meet.

The Milwaukee men took the af-
firmative of the question: “Resolv-
ed, that chain stores are detrimental
to the best interests of the Ameri-
can publiC.” Dave Singer and Frill»
cis Hawk upheld the negative for
The debate was held in the
high school auditorium.

Chain Monopoly Possible

Mr. Hellman, the first speaker for
the affirmative, emphasized the
point that the growth of chain
stores has been such that they will
soon have a virtual monopoly. He
further pointed out that chain stores,
if this rapid growth continues, will
control prices of many commodities.

As an example of this power Mr.
Hellman cited the case of the Stand-
ard Oil company, which today con-
trols the price of gasoline, since it
is backed by large financial interests.
even though it has only 10 per cent of
the business. He also gave examples
of the underhand methods employed
by the chain stores in order to de-
stroy the independent dealer.

Singer Sees Limit

In the first speech of the negative,
Dave Singer stated that there is a
limit beyond which no chain store
can profitably go. He maintained
that if there is too great a growth
of chain stores, it will be stopped by
legislation. In defense of the chain
stores Mr. Singer directed attention
to the advantages of the syste
mass production, mass distribution,
and centralized control.

That chain. stores are helping to
concentrate the wealth in the hands
of a few and are eliminating the mld~
dleman were the points brought out
by Mr. Staudenrnaier in his speech.
He stated that the average net profit
from each Atlantic and Pacific store
is 52,300 every year.

As further proof of his first point,
Mr. staudenmaier said that the four
billion dollars not profit of the chain
stores in 1930 was distributed among
496 persons.

Public Opinion it Check

Francis Hawk pointed out that
chain stores are competing with each
other, and also that public opinion
will suppress the chain stores if they
become a menace. He stated that
the Atlantic and Pacific issues
stock which is sold to people in ev-
