DEBUNKING THE WAR SCARES

To anyone who has been following the news—
papers at all closely for the last two weeks, it
must be an object of wonder that war has not
broken out in any of a dozen places. According
to recent dispatches, Italy and Abyssinia are ready
at any moment to spring at each other’s throats.
Similarly, according to newspaper stories, the
peace in the Balkans was about to be disrupted
by the Greek revolution. The Balkan states
bordering on Greece were said to be massing
their armies and a clash seemed imminent, And
most recently of all, Germany’s decision to openly
rearm seemed to set the journalistic minds
eflame, and according to dispatches, all sorts of
complications and disasters are arising which
seem to threaten to plunge all Europe into a new
war. .

Much emphasis has been placed 'upon the
possibilities of a terrible conflict breaking out in
the near future. Italy is ”ready for wan" Rus—
sia expects war ”in the near future." A “tense
situation“ has developed which may be touched
off at any moment. The whole attitude of the
newspaper stories is one of impending catastrophe,
a situation fraught with dangers, with the poss—
ibility of concilliation and peace improbable, and
the possibility of war imminent.

It appears that an effort is being made to
sensationalize the situation in Europe. A dra-
matic, overdrawn presentation has been employed
which tends to overestimate the seriousness of the
present status in Europe. The choice of mater—
ial, the wording, the “possibilities” and the prov
phccies all work together to leave the impression
in the readers mind that Europe is on the verge
of a war. Scarcely noticable to the reader, Subs
tle coloring seems to have been used in order
to make the story more interesting and readable,
in spite of the fact that such handling is not in
strict acordance with the truth and presents only
one side of the situation» The newspapers are
definitely creating a war hysteria in this country
that will have grave consequences unless it is soon
checked. We are coming to believe that in spite
of our desire for peace, war is both inevitable
and imminent—that there is no way to stop the
tide of conflict now—that we might as well re.
sign ourselves to the pressure of events and pre-
pare ourselves for war. This can be seen in the
complete approval with which the people seem to
view the greatly increased budget for armaments
next year. A feeling of cynicism and despair
toward all efforts for peace is gaining rapidly.
When this idea becomes dominant in the minds
of enough people, then the cause of peace is in—
deed lost. ‘

Where can the responsibility for this sensa—
tionalism be placed? Perhaps upon the enter-
prising press representatives who, in their en-
thusiasm for a good story, overdraw the picture.
Or perhaps upon publishers and editors who find
that printing sensational news is-the best way to
sell their newspapers,

But when reading the news stories about the
latest developments in European affairs, it is well
‘to bear certain things in mind. First, the only
nation in Europe today that is anywhere near
being economically and financially able to carry
on a war, is Russia. And Russia's interests seem
to lie in the direction of developing her program

of internal improvement. It is very improbable
that either Germany or France, upon whom the
journalists place the greatest potentialities for_a
war, would be capable of carrying on a war. Cer-
tainly not Germany with nearly half her laboring
population unemployed, few natural resources
outside of coal and iron, her trade at a very low
level, and her financial situation unstablei Hard-
ly France with a large number of unemployed,
few natural resources, and a government facing
serious monetary problems. Italy, in spite of
her boastful attitude, is still in the experimental
stage of a new type of economic arrangement,
with virtually no natural resources and compara—
tively little foreign trade.

Eighteen years ago, the American people,
inflamed by a wave of propaganda, were drawn
into a disastrous war. Today’s newspapers con-
tain a great deal of similar propaganda. Let us
accept it as propaganda, sensationlized, colored,
overdrawn, and nothing more. We should
not remain blind to the danger, but we should
regard it in the light of rational and sane think-
ing, in order that we may best overcome it.~R.W.

MENACE T0 FREE SPEECH

With the recent prognostication by the presi-
dent and editor of the New Republic, that free
speech advocates are fighting ”what is likely to
be a losing battle against the forces of repression,”
there seems little doubt but what the increased at-
tention of various state legislatures will result in
disaster for the movement of liberalism in cole
leges and universities throughout the country.

Beginning in Wisconsin, the senate, acting

.on a resolution which called attention to the fact

that some University of Wisconsin students have
Communistic affiliations and that agnosticism,
atheism and other “perverse” thought is taught
there, appointed a committee to thoroughly in-
vestigate the situation. Again at the University
of Chicago, the University of Pittsburgh, and
Arkansas, similar investigations are taking placer
Even in Iowa, 2i bill has been proposed to require
college faculty members to take an oath of loyalty
to the constitution. There seems little doubt, how-
ever, that such a measure in Iowa will go beyond
the state legislature or that investigations in other
states will go beyond the investigation stage.

The surge of patriotism by the legislative
bodies which has prompted the introduction of
such measures, is probably traceable to the agita—
tion of the Hearst syndicate who recently claimed
there were many professors in colleges and uni—
versities who advocated Communistic and Social-
istic principles. The result of the Hearst campaign
was a feeling against the rights of educational
institution to free thought, free speech, and free
press.

There is little doubt but what the days of
fright over mere expressions of communistic opin—
ions is over, yet a menace still exists, In days
when Stracheys are arrested and when the gen-
eral assemblies of states become alarmed over
the free and unbiased thinking of men in colleges,
then a forecast that free speech is,1osing ground
is certainly not amissr ' ——R. D.

EXCHANGE PROFESSORSHJPS

The recent invitation from Scripps college to
Professor Payne to spend a year as Exchange
Professor at Scripps is in line with a Grinnell
tradition of some years’ standing. The Harvard
exchange relationship, which has existed for a
number of years, was intended originally to pres
vide for an actual exchange between Harvard
and Grinnell, and in a few instances, notably in
the case of Professor Conard and Professor Nor»
ris, members of our faculty have actually been in
residence at Harvard while members of the Hair»
varcl faculty were at Grinncll.

Other exchange arrangements in recent years
have included a year’s residence by Professor
Lavell at Rollins college in Florida on leave from
Grinnell, and similar leaves of absence for Pro»
fessor Strong at the University of North Caro~
mont Conn]

lina; for Professor Wood at Trinity college, Harte
ford, Conn; for Miss Andersen at Scripps college,
Claremont, Call, for Miss Boyd at Kobe college,
Kobe, Japan; for Miss Clark at the library of
the Pacific Relations committee in Hawaii; and
for Mr. Nollen at Pomona college, Claremont,
Cal. Miss Eager is at present on leave, work—
ing in the Extension department of the State
College at Ames,

Such exchange relations have prov-
en stimulating to the persons involved and
interesting and helpful to the institutions repre-
sented, Grinnell will follow Professor and Mrs.
Payne with all good wishes during their year’s
absence and will welcome them back with en-
thusiasm on the expiration of their leave of ab-
sence. _ —John S. Nollerl»

CHAPEL
NOTES

The changing concept of personality
was outlined by John D. Stoops. pro.
lesser of philosophy, in his series of
chapel talks this week.

The Hebrews, Greeks. and Romans
had religions centering in the state,
with a people of one blood, one city,
and one personality. The individual
thought of himself through the cenw
trality of the state, Mri Stoops Said.
There are four groups with that same
idea today: Soviet Russia, Germany,
ltaly, and Japan, he declared.

Professor Stoops stated that Socrates
incarnated the chrurch, a new kingdom
of the mind, which set itself up ouL
side the state and had nothing to do
with its political and economic organ.
ization. “Jesus," he said, ”incarnated a
new world of love.”

“The American mind and personal.
ity were not created miraculously and
stored in the brain, but are something
acquired," the speaker said. Pioneerlng
in a new country forced Americans to
develop a personality peculiar to this
country.

In 1916 we lost the right to control
our personal lives on our entrance i
to the World War; in 1929 we lost the
right to work, he said. “Reconstruc
tion of our political and social life 15

of our lives and rights,” the speaker
concluded.

ﬁThis is a story told on Creighton
university‘s new line coach, John
"Butch" Polisky,

' While coaching the freshman spuad at
Notre‘ Dame in 1929 under Knute
Rockne, l>olisky would have as many
as 200 or 300 yearlings under his
wing. Later, when the men were round.
ed into shape, Rockne would call the
length of the field: “Poooolissskeee.
bring that team of yours down here!"

whereupon, Polisky would trot down
the field with five teams in tow , . .
"Just to be sure he made no mistake

in the team Rockne wanted.”
