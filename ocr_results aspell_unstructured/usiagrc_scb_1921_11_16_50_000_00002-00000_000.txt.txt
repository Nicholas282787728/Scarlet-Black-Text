m ROLL CALL

This week comes the annual Red
Cross Roll Call, The work being!
carried on by this organization is of
such a high character and is so well
known until. needs little comment,
and yet it ls posslhle that some at!
~the student body are not aware or the
coming campaign. As beiore. eiiorts
will he made to get the unanimous
hacking ot the students in Grinnell,
working thru a student organization,
tormulated tor the purpose.

The Red Cross movement is not a
local one but is national-in its scope
and international in its work. The-
organiaation comprises. some of the
tinest at our Americans citizens and
their errorts have been, and are, rec-
ognized universully. The annual Roll
Call gives everyone on opportunlLyA
to support the movement and to help
carry on the great work that has been
undertaken. in this, as in slmllarl
movements, the \Students oi Grinnell
will not be found lacking.

msnml‘ommn

Every day the need of accurate
knowledge becomes more evident, in
industry, in the prolessions, in edu-
cational work. The demand for men
Ind women who are trained Ln prac-
tical matters as well as in theory is
equally strong and the colleges or the
country are turning more and more
attention to the problem ol linking
the theoretical and the present in such
iashion as to meet this demand torl
skilled workers, as well as to over--
come the greatest criticism cl the
work or the college and the university
—namely impracticallty.

While the' institutions are attempt-
ing to solve, this problem, they aim—
not overcome the inertia. of an unin~
terested student body. The only way
that such o. movement can be success-
ful is for evelyone to cooperate in the
eitoit for a more thorough curricu-
lum and tor each individual to map
out and :oliow ior himsell a course ot
outside reading that will cover the
general trend at present day events.

At this time, in particular, it is
essential that each student should
keep abreast ol the time and keep in
touch with the national and interna-
tional aliairs that are or such vital in—
terest to the world in general. The

It takes but a low minutes a day to

SCHOLARSHIP REACTIONS

It often happens that the average
student hnds himseii so overwhelmed
with assignments in one or two cours—
es that he feels it impossible to make
the amount of time available suffice
ror all his work. This usually results
in a lit oi dejection or of reaction that
falls to accomplish even part of the
required lsbor. With such a condition
in mind the Willmette Collegian,
student publication of Willamette
University, Salem are, prints the lol-
lowing editorial under the head of
"Scholarship Reactionst"

“Reactions are dangerous things.
it may be that in the change irom a
scholarship basls mimittedly too low,
protessors my swing the pendulum
to an extreme lully as drastic as the
place trons which the pendulum start-
ed its movement

“Certain postulates may well be
kept in mind. Time, all philosophical
inquiries to the side, is very definite
in the lite of the college student. Days
ere days and each hour contains but
the same number or minutes as in
days gone by. Assignments, no mat-
ter the scholastic standard, which vi—
olate the actual time available, are as~
sul'ed progenitors of discontent.

"The movement is in its infancy. It
may/he checked heioro the tide oi
discouragement has set in too mr.
and it may be that in a strength as
yet unknown, studEnts may cope with
the added tasks oi a more strict
standard. hut when the majority of
students, working hard and consci—
entiously, tail to pass the mark. there's
something wrong with the standard.

“Reactions are dangerous things.
Common sense and realization oi the
human side oi: scholars and the exis-
tence or time limits may prove great
hoops to the prolessor who is striv—
ing to lead'his tutelage to that edu-
cational ideal, an awakening oi: inter-
est and eltort on the part oi the slur
dent in the subject studied.“

SLIPI‘ING INTO RUTS.

There are so many ruts that a per—
son is in danger of slipping into that
he must be constantly on the lookout
lest he get into lhe habit of traveling

in these treacherous paths.
He gets into El. deep and dangerous

rut when he begins to take too much
tor granted. The only things that
is instilled in taking tor
granted. as coming to him are old age
and death.

Taking things for granted kills
initiative and has a tendency to pro-
mote the habit of sitting down to Wait
for things to happen without raising
a linger to alter the course of events.
A student that gets a good grade in
his work takes it ior granted that he

will pass, and it he keeps on getting
good grades he takes it tor granted
that he will graduate after four years.

What Do You Think

Editor Scarlet and Black:

College men steal books. Book
thievery is being practiced more this
year than at any time during the past
few years. There are numerous l'u-
mors which :tccuse certain freshmen
of smiling linoks and selling them as
second hand editions. Whether these
rumors are true in their accusation or
not, does not lessen the important
truth that books are being stolen in
