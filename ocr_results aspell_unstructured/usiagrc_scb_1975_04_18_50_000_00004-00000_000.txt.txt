SGA: the old, '

the new,
and the lame

For the most part not their own fault, SGA operates on a
rather strange schedule that staggers elections causing a
new President cabinet to sit with an old Joint Board during
the spring. The president and vice president are elected, in
accordance with the constitution, prior to spring break and
assume office when school reconvenes. They are not
presented with a new legislative body until late April after
room draw. Representation in the Joint Board is on the basis
of hall and new representatives can not be chosen until the
new occupants of the hall are determined

The effect of this is the creation of Grinnell’s own version
of a lame duck session where the legislative capacity is held
in escrow until new faces are elected to venture into ARH 11.
Prior to their meeting Wednesday, the Joint Board had not .
met since February 19 at which point the old cabinet closed
up shop. The new cabinet has been reluctant to initiate any
matters with the old Joint Boards as a group that is soon to
leave the scene.

The one meeting that has taken place between the new
cabinet and the old Joint Board found the later adopting a
substantive resolution in which it advised the future Joint
Board to undertake a specific action in conjunction with the
new cabinet. It in effect refused and felt that it could not act
on the matter in any substantial capacity without deferring
to a future Joint Board. The few stalwarts of the old Joint
Board present, realized their abbreviated future continuance
in office.

The greatest detriment of the election schedule is that
SGA just does not meet at all during this period The time
between the election of a president and vice president, and
when they can meet with a new Joint Board carrying over
into next year is sufficiently long for platforms to gather
dust for lack of a body to act on them. Almost two months of
the semester will pass and the Joint Board will have only met
once.

Some would say how appropriate if not fitting for this
august body. There is much that Joint Board in conjunction
with the cabinet can do during this period, Not meeting, it
seems that there is little that it can do in terms oflegislation.

The most unfortunate result of the current election
schedule is that the 1975-76 Joint Board probably will not
meet until April 30 at which time they will take up next
year's budget with only two weeks remaining in the
semester, The careful attention that the budgetary process
needs will be lacking unless the budget can be disguised as a
take-home examination.

It is unfortunate that the new cabinet is faced with the
restraints of the current situation. We hope they would
undertake to rectify the calender discripancies for their
predecessors.

Dean
vvasteful

To the Editor:

The amount of paper wasted on
this campus has reached an un-
tolerable level, Nearly everyday
each and every mailbox receives
at least one and often several “allc
campus stuffings.” The most
outrageous abuses ol this in-
formation distribution technique
have come from the Ad-
ministration

l refer speciﬁcally to the memo
on lhe academic pressure survey
from Dean Walker which was
distributed to the’ college come
munity this week. A simple
message which would have taken a
couple ol inches of space in the
Campus Memo required (by the
Dean's method) an extra sheet of
paper. This is inexcusable.

Fundamentally the vast amount
of paper wasteage is reprehensible
from an environmental-
conservationist perspective.
Although the vital place of pulp
products in our society un-
fortunately requires the clearing oi
vast amounts of forest land. there
can be no justification for wanton
use which destroys more forest
than necessary. The short term
aesthetic and longer term ens
virunmental and economic con-
sequences oi extensive harvesting
of pulp are more than clear.

From an economic standpoint
one would expect Dean Walker, of
all people, to be cautious in the use
of paper. Notices of all sorts on
high quality paper come spewing
out of our boxes, but the most
significantone is howmuchmoreit
will cost to get the Grinnell Ex-
perience next year, and how many
fewer faculty and staff will be here
to help create it.

Least important, but perhaps
most salient to the distributors, all
campus stuffing: do not get the
message across. One merely needs
to watch die notices go into the
trash cans unread, or to get a blank
stare from someone upon men~
tioning something contained in one
of those notices, to see this con-
sequence.

All of us need to be more Con-
Scions of the amount of paper that
gets wasted in the course of a day.
The blank backs of all those sheets
are excellent for notes, papers,
letters, and for re-use when a mass
distribution is necessary. Several
organizations and individuals
already ’attempt to make use of

, Scarlet and Black, April '18., 9‘

some of this paper by informally
collecting it.

But that only makes the best of
the current situation. Individuals
and organizations must think again
each time the urge strikes to do an
all-campus stuffing, Further,
consideration needs to be glven to
more effective means of com-
municating cvenis and in-
formation, and to using low grade
paper to minimize the effects of the
necessary notices,

Paper is too precious lo continue
the indiscriminate use as is the
current practice.

To the Editor:

Mr. Cleaver’s article in last
week’s Scarlet and Black, with the
fine photocopy reproductions of
two items from the “Selected
Works from The Rehling
Collection of Art" exhibition, on
display in the Forum Terrace-
Level Gallery, was generous and
timely. Such appreciation is
welcome and interest in [his fine
gift collection will hopefully
continue and increase as further
items are accessioned and
displayed from time to time.

Among the works recently
received in the first segmentof Mr.
Rehling’s gift are a few whose
provenance and attribution are
Still to be verified through
research, A specific example is ths
small pencandink drawing with
the signature "L. da Vinci".
Authenticating [his and several
other such “treasures” will be part
of projects sludons andothers will
have the opportunity to experience
at first hand. As such, this is a
built-in esthetic plus which makes
the Rehling Collection an even
greater educational boon,

To the Editor:

As Chairman of the inaugural
Committee, I would like to express
my appreciation to the Campus
community—and especially
studentsifor their cooperation,
help, and good humor over the

could not have been successful
without so many willing hands.
Certainly it was a demonsiraiion
thatallsegmentsofthecommunity
can work together in harmony
when we want to,

Thanks again.

Thanks
forfun

To the Editor:

Congratulations to the entire
campus community for proving
that it is indeed possible to have
fun at Grinnell. Special thanks to 1
those administrators and faculty
who had the foresight to push for,
and approve. ihe cancellation of
classes last Friday; to the
poweris) that be who decreed that
we be blessed with a beautiful day;
and a huge round of applause to
Tom Ackerman. who coordinated
the e ire day’s and evening’s
fest es (with a little help from
his friends).

In three years at Grinnell, 1 have
never before witnessed such a
contagious display of good feelings
and enjoyment. Granted. it Was for
a special ocoaision, but isn‘t the
arrival of spring and the need to
relieve pressures occasion
enough? Isn’t it strange that for

’vir'tually ‘th'e'first time, we

“discovered" the huge pool of
talents at Grinnell and built a day
around them? Isn’t it so much
more worthwhile when everybody
participates rather than passively
watches?

1 guess what I’m trying to say is
that I was impressed by what I
observed and hope that we can
make ihis a yearly event. I know
there's a need for it. —Boh Jacobs
