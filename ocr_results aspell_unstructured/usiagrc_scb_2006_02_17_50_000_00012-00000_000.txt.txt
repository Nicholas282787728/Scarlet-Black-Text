The Grinnell College mens basketball team put
themselves one step closer to a playoff spot after heat-
ing Illinois College in Jacksonville, Ill. with a final

John Grorberg '09, the nation's lending scorer
(32.0 points per game), led the way for the Pioneers
with a game-high 37 points, 27 ofthose points coin-
ing from behind the arc.

The pioneers got what rliey wanted on WedneSr

game with a final score of 102- 83.

The game against Knox was more than a matter of
pride for the Grinnell men's basketball team. “... the

Men’ 5 tennis starts off with a pair of shutout wins

sv LOLA GARCIA

The Grinnell men’s tennis team
opened their season with pair of de-
cisive wins in Lincoln, Neb. last week.
The Pioneers defeated both Nebraska
Wesleyan and thlliam Jewel in two
back-to-back army meets last Sunday
Grinnell took both meets seven to zero,
completely shutting down the competir
tion..

Dan LaFonminc ’09 who is cur-
rently playing in the team’s number one
spot, soundly defeated Nebraska Wesr
leyan’s Zac Kerr with two 6-1 sets. La
Fontaine also had no trouble defeating
William Jewel’s number one, taking the
game in two sets 60 and 671.

“The expectations for this year’s
team [are] very high, and to get off to
a start with wins in all positions was a
great start for the team," LaFountalne
said.

He added that although Grinnells
team had more skill than both of the

Nebraska teams it was not why the
Pioneers won both meets.

“The hard work and spirit of our
team put us over the top," said Lafounr
taine. “We are driven to succeed."

LaFonraine also plays in rhe num-
ber one doubles spot with fellow rookie
and roommate Nate Fox ’09. Set up
to Live together through Coach Andy
Hamilton, the duo looks like it is off
to an equally successful season. The
pair defeated theirWesleyan and Jewel
opponents by margins of 8-3 and 8-1
respectively.

Last Sunday was one of Fox and
LaFountaine’s first opportunities to
compete as doubles partners, giving
both players a chance to find their
rhythm together.

Fox thinks the two will make a
good team.

“I thinkwe workvery well together,"
Fox said. We have good chemisrry.

take the D111 Midwest Doubles Con-
ference title together at the conference
meet later this spring. LaFountaine also
has his eye on the MWC singles title.

All of the Pioneers were victorious
in last Sunday’s singles competitions
by wide margins. Although Eli Best
'07 did move into a third set against
Wesleyan's Nate Anderson, he ﬁnished
it off with the largest margin of a single
set, closing it 101.

“We kind of have no choice but to
be happy," said Best. “Everyone played
well, especially rhe freshmen, they
showed no jitters."

seniors Rick Fenbert and Julian
West also held their own during the
meets, handily finishing off each of
their opponents tn two sets.

The Pioneer netmen have won the
last two league titles and in Hamilton’s
nine years as coach, rhe Pioneers have
taken the south division title seven
times.

“Our goal is definitely to win the
conference title,‘ said LaFountnine.

The men's tennis team is also look
ing out for the long term in terms of
regional rankings and possibly quallfyt
ing for narionals.

Though LaFountaine said that nae
tional qualification this year was “fear
sible but not likely" the team hopes
to raise its rankings within the region
with an eye towards qualifying in the
near future.

The men’s tennis team will face
their first conference opponents this
weekend, when they host Beloit and
Wartburg on the indoor tennis courts.

The team is feeling pretty confi-
dent after their latest performance go-
ing into Saturday’s meet.

“We can’t take a win for granted,"
said Best, “but we’d really like to stick it
to them and show the rest of the con-
ference thar we've even improved over

Swimming and diving take the MWC title

BY Asav RAPOPORT

As every swimming season comes to a close,
Conch Erin Hurley hopes for the best performances
possible from her swimmers and divers at the Mid-
west Conference Championships, As usual, Hurley
was not disappointed.

This year’s swimming and diving teams have been
one of the strongest in years and the teams have the
records to prove it.

The men's and women’s diving teams not only
won their respective Midwestern Conference Cham-
pionships. the reams also broke four school records in
the process. While the season is now over for almost
everyone, co-captains Dan Shryock loo, Peter Brown
’06 and Sarah Stayer or) have all provisionally quali-
fied for nationals.

Brown alone broke two school records in both the
50 free and the 200 free, the latter being the swim
team‘s oldest record, dating back to 1984. Brown went
on to win the 100 free and he was also named Swim-
mer of the Year.

Shryoek, who was named Diver or the Year for
the second year in a row, set a Midwestern confer—
ence Championship record with a dive he had never
attempted before in competition. His expectations for
the championship were low because ofa poor practice
before rhe meet began. However, by the end of the
meet he had broken championship record and also
provisionally qualified for nationals on the one meter.

Stayer was also surprised by the incredible perfor-
mances ar the meet, “You walk away [from a previous
conference] thinking it's never gonna be better, but to
come back and have people be even more amazing is
just unbelievable" she said.

Stayer, who had to switch her hurdle leg after knee
surgery on a torn ACL, provisionally qualified for nae
tionals on the three meter.

Stayer, Brown and Shryock will all have to wait
about two weeks before they hear if they will make it
to nationals.

None of these star performers expected to do so
well.“ln the back ofmy mind I had kind ofhoped but

I didnt think it was realistic," said Brown. Instead he
was “focused on the team aspect of the competition."

The team focus was evident in all parts of the
meet, particularly in the times of exhibition swim-
mers,who did not have a chance to advance to finals
themselves but swam their best in the hopes of seed-
ing their teammates weu.

The team also focused on getting closer through
out the season, allowing them to support each other
even more at the meet.

“This season as a whole was the best sports season
l’ve ever had in my life I feel like this was the per
feet culmination," said Shryock.

The women’s 400 medley relay team, Julia
Mel-[ugh '07, Lucy McCormick '06, Amanda Keled-
jian '08 and Lauren Gehbauer’07, also broke a school
record.

“We may not have won as many individual titles as
in years past but our depth was the strongest it's ever
been and that’s what makes a competitive champions
ship team," said Hurley.
