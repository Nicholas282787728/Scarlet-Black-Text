In a lettel to the editor ill this issue, a reader, (1111th

at the \lllltal v Ball.

But then he goes on‘ to say, "If the demonstrato cans
Lot implement their opinions, their display of Saturday
night-stands open to condemnation as at best useless and}
at worst childish.”

We do not believe that this particula \demonstration

’l lsed on childish 01 useless concepts.

But we would call chil’dishior pathetic—the behavior

showing their ignorance of or indifterence toward American
lights and problems, displayed actions much more contrary
to American philosophy. and belief than did the students
they heckled with cries of "eo'mlnies," “save your rubles"
1nd ”queers."

These observers ,selflt'igllteollsly labeled themselves
“loyal Americans” and then proceeded to demonstrate _11ot

against the peaceful advocation of ideas. '1'

This type ofaction is nothing new for America. There
have been such JanusJaced people in every generation. But
\-e are angry and ashamed that such base ignorance, prej—
udice and indifference exists at an institution devoted to
tie advancement of truth through education.

«Convention Is-Rare Opportunity

The mock convention this weekend is probably as good
chance to not an abstract, liberal education to practice
any of us will get before we graduate.

Every semester we take our courses 111 history and
1.11manities, government and literature, science and. sociol»
egy. Sometimes we find ourselves wondering what good
1 of this fact and theory will do.\

In our opinion, if everybody lets themselves get .1117
\olved in the convention, we will see how textbook learning
and assigned reading can be put to use.

Getting involved 111 the convention does not mean turn»
ing' t into a farce as are most of the Student council con-
\‘entions. It means approaching the various issues, develop-
ments and problems as a person with a wide background
of knowledge. It means seriousness and reason. It means
2- respect for rules of procedure and conduct.

If it is approached in this \xay the Mock Political

First. it must be understood
that the main objection to the
reviews that harm appeared in

process of their criticism they
have poinllessly thrown ”every<
