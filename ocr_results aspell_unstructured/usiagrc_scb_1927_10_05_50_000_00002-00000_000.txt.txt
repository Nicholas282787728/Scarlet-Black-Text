GRADES.

At the and of each semester, every student is pre-
sented \\‘ith a small slip of paper which indicates how
well or ill he has progressed in his studies. ' Many
claim indifference to their grades, but there are few
who are not really at heart pleased or displeased with
their rankings. Students are told that grades do not
count. Perhaps they should not count; unfortunately
that is not true. By then] are we judged. If a student
transfers from Gl'lnllell to another place, the only record
of his Worth that he has to show is the transcript of
grades from the registrar's office. Even in passing from
course to course or department to department, the
student has only his grade.

The method of grading is distinctly a problem. VV'hat
has the above to do With the problem? This—n0 two
instructors grade alike. one man says A is 90 to 100:
B 80 to ﬁll; etc. But his proflesslonal colleague main—
tains that A is 95 to 100; B 85 to 90; etc. Consequently
a. student with a. grade of B, or 92, under the latter might
have been rated as an A under the former.

There seems to be but one solution. Let the student

be marked “passe nl' ulct ' “Then," some i
“what becomes of our honor organizations?" Are they
so iiral a part or our lilc? Merit in the student‘s luajur
subjcct might be recognized; his standing will be luost
consistent tlrcrc. Bill the linguist's ability to cope with
nurthcruatics or the inus' ians to master economics will
be no hindrance.

ll say,

Surely there is no doubt that the present system of
grading has certain detects, The tune for remedying
thc situation is now—riot at the end or the year when
these defects have been made patent. The strident cannot
holp himself; rcrurni must conic tram the laculty.

WHITE INCO) IDER \TION.

On September 26, the white students or the Emerson
high school in Gun, Indiana, went on a strike. The
moo striking students, hacked by their parents paraded
the streets, carrying banners hearing the horde, "We
\Vorit' Go Back Until Emerson IS White", and it was
necc. arr to call out three machine gun squads to patrol
the or y The strike was in protest or the appearance of
tu Cllti'rlolll' colored students in the Emerson High school,

This was not the ﬁrst time that colored students had
entered the high school. Three members or the senior
class were colored but the white students secured willing
to allow them to remain as they had taken the full course.

When the white students or the Emerson high school
went on strike they did not think of the tact that the
colored students, as American citizens, had an equal right
to an education. The population of Gary is 102,000
with lrom fourteen to eighteen per cent negro, and the
colored population as well as the white, pays taxes which
are used to support the public schools. Neither did the
students consider the law or Indiana which not only says
that the negrocs shall be segregated when possible, hilt
that they must have the same facili es as the whites.
The settlement of the strike resulted in the appropriation
of $15,000 for the construction ot a temporary building
{or colored students, In time, the ncgroes may be given
school facilities equal to those or the white students, but
these can not be procured this year, and in the meantime
twenty-tour American students are cheated oirt or a fair
education.

Such a strike, led by a boy with selﬁsh rights, was
more detrimental to Ga than it was beneﬁcial. The
strike did not prolilote i cndly feelings between the two
t'aces, but caused bitterness and stirred up hatred. A
little vicarious “suffering" on the part of tho‘white
students for the maintenance or friendly relations worild
have shown better American citizenship. But instead,
the white students acted like a selﬁsh bunch at young
stcrs. uhn demand their own way, and because they can
not have it, become quitters. , This strike was an act of
exceedingly poor sportsmanship, and poorer citizenship,
