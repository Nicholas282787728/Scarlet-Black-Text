_ - I % Hoopsters back on

track; shut down Knox
63-59 in overtime

by Bob Lifton

It's choosing the lesser of
two evils. Either get blown out
by 20 on your home court, or
lose by a bucket in the waning
seconds. Notan enviable choice.

The men's basketball team
unfortunately received a first-hand
sampling of this unadmirable
dilemma. Last Friday the
Pioneers were ransacked 84-64 by
rival Coe. It was one of “those"
losses—you know, the ones
which leave you feeling a little
woozy. Nobody~fans and
players alike—knew exactly what
had hit them. Expressions on
their faces suggested trailer-park
occupants in the wake of a
tornado.

Seemingly regrouped,
Grinnell entertained Cornell on
Tuesday evening in front of a
sparse Darby crowd. The Rams’
comcrfrom-behind 65-63 win
spoiled the party.

The Pioneers were never
really in the Coe game. From
the opening tip, thoughts of
Custer going into battle raced
through my mind. But then
again, I’m not quite sure any
team could have kept pace with
the Kohawks on this night, since
they managed 53 percent from the
field, many coming on long-
range three-pointers. Shooting a
dismal 38 percent, Grinnell never
stood a chance.

At the half, the visitors were
up by 9, 35-26. They spent the
next 20 minutes building on this
lead, at one point going up by as
many as 22. When Grinnell did
amass a surge of their own, Coe
quickly put them back in their
place. Trading hoops works to
no avail when you’re down by
20.

Said Coach Wcstlund of the
massacre, “We were very, very
tired, and they were very, very
good.” Not a helluva
combination, to say the least.

Despite the final tally, there
were some standout performances
for the Pioneers. Sophomore
George Mchmscy was on fire all

According to the women‘s
basketball tcztm, persistence, not
only patience, holds as one of an
individual‘s finest virtues. It was
truly persistence, as well as some
patience, that helped the Pioneers
break a six gamc losing streak in
convincing fashion this past
week against the top two teams
in the conference. Monmouth
and Krrox are still wondering
what happened.

ll is possible that rcvcngc
was a motive for the Pioneers.
since both teams soundly defeated
them a couple of weeks ago. But
I think the desire to prove oneself
dcfimtcly outwcighcd any revenge
factor. And prove themselves
they did.

On Saturday, while many
were at home watching Kenny
“thc SKY” Walker dcfcat Clyde
“the GLYDE” Drexlcr for the
Slam Dunk Title, a large crowd
assembled in Darby Gymnasium
to watch a Pioneer team win a
game for the first time in a
month. The Pioneers apparently
had no problems forgetting about
their woes against Coe, a 77-43
defeat last Tuesday, as they
opened the game with an intense
defensive effort.

The Pioneers only trailed by
l at halftime. 38-37, thanks in
part to an awesome defensive
effort by Lisa Giersbach, great
perimeter shooting by Jenny
Wood, and rebounding by Leigh
Ashley. The most exciting part
was that the fun was only about
to begin.

Coach Eskildsen was able to
inspire his troops at the half: and

they came out blistering. lmcan
hot! It was their best halfof ball
in a long time.

The Pioneers started the half
with a 17-5 run. Laura
VanSlckle and Julio Kastcr
provided much of the scoring
punch during the stretch that saw
Grinncll take an l1 point advan-
tage. The lead was increased to
15 on a basket by Ashley, who
grabbed 7 bounds and scored 9
points before fouling out late in
the second half. Sucllcn

Robinson, making her work for

Hngcman also had a team high 8
rebounds.

The game was almost iced,
but the Scots began to shoot a
baragc of “trey-pieces” and
actually cut the lead to scvc
points. This is where the
persistence showed itself.

The Pioneers hit 5 of6 clutcl

Proposition 42: No:
proposition at all

by Bob Lifton

All is anything but quiet on
the college front.

A recent ruling by the
National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) regarding
freshman eligibility has stirred
cries of racism by numerous
oppositional forces. Sadly for
the NCAA, these cries ring true.

In an attempt to “reinstate"
academics into Division~l college
athletics (or at least so it goes),
in 1985 the NCAA passed a
ruling which prevented colleges
from offering scholarships to
students who failed to maintain a
cumulative 2.0 gradc»poinl
average in high scltool and score
a combined 700 on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test or a 15 on the
Amcricltn College Test.
