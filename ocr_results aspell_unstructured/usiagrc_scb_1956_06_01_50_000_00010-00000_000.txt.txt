A clear nine—point wm in the
Midwest Contercnce meet on
March 2 terminated for the
Grillnell college swimming
team, a season notable for the
brilliant consistency of cO-cap~
tam Joel Stubbs and the almost
phenomenal improvement of
two sophomores, Rob Madgett
and Bill Simmons:

Commencmg the season at
the Knox relays on Dec. 3, the
team succeeded only 111 securing
two seconds and athlrd at th1s
meet and was defcatcd the [ole
lowing weekend by Nebraska U.
53—31, Stubbs winning the 100
and so yd. events and anchoring
the vietonous relay team.

Team Drowns St Olaf

Returning to the fray otter
the Ch1~1stmas vacation, the
Grinnell finmen overwhelmed
St Olaf w1th a 59731 v1ctory

that boosted the tean'i's morale

considerably. Winning seven of
ten events through the efforts
of Marsh, Stubbs, Simmons,
Madgett, and Banister, the
team prepared for the success
slve onslaughts of Carleton and
Knox on Jan. 21 and Jan. 27.
The next: two wcel'tcnds saw
disaster, however, as Grinncll
lost 43—15 to Carleton and 49.44
to Knox. Both of those meets
were Closely fought, the one
agamst Carleton bcmg decided
in the last event the 44D»yd
relay, which was won by Carlee
ton by a more 2/10 of a see
ond. By this time Grlnnell’s
strength in the free style events
was becoming not1ceable as
again won the so and
events, and Simmons,
the 4407 d. event with Ballis-
tcr sccond- Nielsen also won the

ZOO—yd. breaststroke event while
Madgett look the dwing title.

Defeated but not discouraged,
the team rallied to overcome
Cornell at Mt. Vernon on Feb.
10 only to lose to Gustavus
Adolphus by a heart—breaking
margin of one point in a tri-
angular mect the next day. The
encouraging feature of this
meet was, however, that Grin—
ncll had defeated Monmouth,

path to the conference meet

Baseball Possibly A Thing Of The Future Here

Varsity baseball may be a
thing‘of the future at Giinnell
college. In‘ a meeting last month
attended by some thirty-one 111-
tcrested (men, Coach John
Pfitsch announced that “the dc
partinent of physical education
and the administration were
gathering information on how
much a baseball program would
involve iinancmlly and what
material there

vias at Grlnnell already."

”We are assuming that )otl
mcn here or sent would he plav-
111g varsity usehau this ,
it we had a piogram, szlld
Pfitsch. of the thntv one men
present twelve wc1e freshmen,
A11 unofficial count showed five
p1tchcrs present and the same
amount of catchers,

of the problems facing
organization at a varsity

the
team

 

the most outstanding is that of
an adequate diamond With the
initiation 91 a summer baseball
program for local youthsthcre
will be an aceeptabe diamond
available after the coming sum»
mer.

Another problem 'that was
presented was that on a‘tra
and baseball program interfa-
ing with each other. Coach E.
G, Booth who tutors the track
sqtlntl and who would bc_ the

- most likely individual to object
to baseball 11 intertcrcncc were,

a valid problem stated, “I, as
track coach, am not oppos cl to
baseball at Grinnell and it 1
felt that the interest was trom
