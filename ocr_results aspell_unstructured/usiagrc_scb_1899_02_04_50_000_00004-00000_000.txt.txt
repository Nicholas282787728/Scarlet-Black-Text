At a meeting of the Athletic
Union yesterday two committees
were appointed, one to arrange
for an Athletic Union beneﬁt en»
tertainment; the other to arrange
for reopening the gymnasium.
Arrangements have been made
about the latter. and it will prob-
ably be opened the ﬁrst of next
week. The union will have to run
it and be responsible tor any dis-
order. For this reason it has been
decided that no one but members
or the union who huve paid their
dues for this semester will be ad-
mitted to take work ot any kind
in the gym.

All students of the college and
academy may become members of
the union upon paying the semes—
ter dues, which may be paid at
any time to the Athletic Union
treasurer. Charles Engelke. The
gymnasium will be used as a cage
for the baseball men up to four
o’clock. and until that time none
but baseball men will be allowed
inside either to work or look on.
These rules will be rigidly adhered

 

to. in order to partly repay the
union tor its expense and to guard
against having the gymnasium
treated as it has been in the past
month or two.
