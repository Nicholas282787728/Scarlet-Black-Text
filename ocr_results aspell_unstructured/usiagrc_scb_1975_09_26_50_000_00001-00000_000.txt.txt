J Robert Scllaetzel, an
. outspoken ioreign policy critic,
former State Department ofr
fictzll. and author, Will be on
campus Sept. 29 througii
Thursday. Oct. 2 as this
semester‘s Woodrow Wilson
Senior Fellow, Schaetze] will

European Integration” and
"The Future of Europeans
American Relations.” He will
also make classroom ap-
pearances and meet intormaliy
with students and tacuity
members at discussion sessxons
and meals.

Schaelzel was the American
Ambassador to the European
Communities in Brussels,
Belgium [rpm 1966 until 1972.
Prior to this he was director oi
the task force on the
organization and personnel
policy oi the Department oi
Slate. a special assistant to the
Undersecretary of State for
Economic Affairs. the special
assistant to the Undersecretary
of State, and Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for Atlantic
Affairs.

A specialist on the Western
European community and its
loreign economic policies,
Schaetzel resigned irom
government service at the end
of W72 and is now a Writer,
lecturer, and business cone
sultant He continues to make
frequent visits to Europe in
order to ioliow the rapidly
changing economic and
political developments for his
many articles and other
writings.

European unity is or major
concern to Schaetzel. especially
With regard to his studies of the
European Economic Com-
munity tEEc or the Common
Market.) Critical of the Nixon
FordrKisSinger approach to
European relations, Schaetzel
feels that America’s role should
not be restricted to individual
detente.

In an article for The New
York Times entitled “Music by
Schuman, Lyrics by Ford."
Schaetzel examines the
“psychosis oi an America that
feels itself alone and in-
creasingly impotent in a hostile
world." He objects to the unr
connected and vague melange
of diplomatic actics that the
past two adm' istrations have
been pursuing, and suggests
instead a coherent. planned
strategy,

He criticizes President
Gerald Ford and Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger for
laki glho momentum out. of Ihe

process of European unification
which Schaetzel feels began
twentyrfive years ago with
French postwar Foreign
Minister Robert Schuman. He
points out that Kissenger‘s
diplomatic talents have an
”anachronistic stamp” and that
he is basically involved in a
“desperate eitort to patch up
ta) system of client states.
subordinate to and directed by
the United States."

A resurgence oi
isolationalism. or “antie
internationalism" as he terms
it, in American attitudes is a
matter which Schaetzel
discusses at length in his soon-
lo-be-published book
Unhinged Alliance, Ame
Western European Rel
He sees a need for America to
surrender its role as an op-
pressive international overseer

so it may help iacilitate a plan .

of mutual dependency. He says
that in view oi the major world
crises, such as inﬂation, energy
shortages and food scarcity,
Europeans and Americans
must realize that collaboration
is the only road to survivalr
He says the individual ap
proach, which he thinks
Kissinger is taking, only serves
to be devisive. Schaetzel Wants
to see Europe approached as an

entity, not as a collection of
various cities lead by per-
sonalities with differing
demands. He also strongly
disapproves oi the “Old World"
method of Big Two (Kissengerr
Brezhnev) or Big Three con-
ferences.

Schaetzel is basically ope
lirnistic about the future of the
European community. He says
in an interview for Time ”In the
past twenty years the
Europeans have developed a
habit of thinking as Europeans
which is no mean ac-
complishment.” .

He sums up his view oi in-
creasing European community
awareness by saying European
leaders have realized in recent
years that summits are no
longer “Cosmetic events” and
that adversity has iorced and
will _continue to force both
America and Europe to try to
put some solutions together on a
community basis.

in addition to his book,
Schaetzel has written many
articles {or such prestigeous
newspapers and journals as

On September Dean oi
Student Affairs .Illn cdermall and
SGA President will Collins
traveled to Spokane, Washington to
observe the residence hall system
oi Whiiworth College. Tederman's
and Collins’ main reason for
traveling to Whitworth was to
hopefully discover some alternate
lite style that could be applied to
Grinnell’s dorm life,

Tederman feels that for the
independent person who knows
that all he wants is a bed and
meals, Grinnell is doing a good job.
but for the student who is looking
for a community atmosphere, with
more personal interaction among
dorm occupants. the school has
failed to be of much assistance.
Collins uses a stronger term for
summing up the situation. Collins
put it more strongly by saying
dorm life here is plain “Shitty.”

He feels that the non-classroom
education process that should be
taking place in the halls is not
occurring unless by chance. When
one gets on a ﬂoor in a dorm where
a community environment Just
aecidently develops,

However, Tedermali and Collins
found much of Whitworth's dorm
plan unsuitable for Grinnell. as
they state in their report This does
not mean, though, that the search
ior optional hail systems. that may
rclicve what some may call the
hotel-like aspect oi dorm lite. is
dead, Although he does not ioresee
other trips to colleges, Tedcrinan
still is looking into other after
natives. One such plan allows
students the option oistaying in the
same dorm for all four years This
couldhclp create a community like
atmosphere it enough people
participate.

Tedel'man and Collins, however,
emphasized that ii any new (form
system is to be instituted. the
initial desire for it must come from
the students. According to
Tederman, R.A.s will be asked to
inquire among their dorm
residents about possible Ideas.
With Tederman’s assistance, a
suggestion or anything train a iioor
of anthropology majors in a dorm
where a social contract is
developed and followed Could
become a reality in the near future.

Students man

by David Wick

Unlike larger colleges and
universxties, Grinnell doesn't have
a campus police force and,
thereiore, security has always
been minimal Approximately
three years ago, however, Grinnell
students became concerned with
this lack of protection and made
their ieelings known. In response,
the Office of Student Affairs
conceived the idea of a Student
Security Patrol which is now in its
lourth year oi existence.

Consisting of eight student
members, the Patrol is on duty
every Friday and Saturday night
between 1!) p m and 3 am, with
four members working each night.
A team oi two patrols South
while another team
patrols North Campus. The eight
members include Shelton Hampr
ton, Jay Michaud. Sean Ellis, Ann
Lippke, Ben Sparks, Larry Gill,
Don Marlin, and Cheryl Robertson,

Each member is equipped with a
beeper which allows com-
munication with the cam'pus
switchboard, Thus, any student
can get in touch With a Patrol
member on a 247hour basis simply
by calling the operator, Members
also carry an alphabetical roster oi
studcnts so that the identity of any
person can be coniirmed at any
time,

An improvement has been made
this year with the addition of a
reicrrai system, it a member is
confronted by a problem that he or
she can't handle, resident advisors

security posts

Dick V055 and John Hickerershey
are available to assist at anytime.
As a last resort, the Grinnell Police
Department can also be quickly
notified.

Basic duties of the Patrol include
locking residence hall doors,
keeping nonrcollege personnel out
of the buildings. and answering
any emergency calls transmitted
through Ihe switchboard, The
Patrol is not concerned with
student discipline but, rather. the
saiety oi both students and
property

One oi the major complaints
about the patrol has been the
inability to identify members thus
lending [he impression that the
Patrol never even exisited,
Beginning next week, this problem
will be erased as members will be
wearing white arm bands.

Cooperation oi the student body
with the Patrol is essential ii any
degree of effective security is to be
maintained. according to Sue
Crim, patrol director. Some
Students have felt that the locking
Of hall doors creates hassles
because not everyone likes to carry
their key. Crim. hopes that these
students will realize that locked
doors prevent thefts and van-
dalism quite effectively. She
emphasized that the personal
rights oi everyone will be
recognized and respected much
more it a spirit oi cooperation can
be achieved, making the job of the
Security Patrol easier.
