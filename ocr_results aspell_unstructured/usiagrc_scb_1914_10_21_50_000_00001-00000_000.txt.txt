The Frcslnnairllisli School game
last Saturday proved an easy victory
for the College aggregation, which
completely outplayed their opponents
at every stage ot the game, running up
a score of 27 to 0 against the orange

Stellar work by par-her and Mc-

was phenomenal. Wires and iialhcson

Hard scrimmage work against the
Freshmen has been the feature of prac-
lice this weelt in preparation for this
contest, and thc 'vnrsity dctensc is be-
ing worked out as perfectly as pos-
siblo. in the scrimmage last night the
yearlings scored nine points against
the veterans. on an intercept/ed for-

Ward pass by Parker and on a goal
from the ﬁeld.

‘Vili'sity Line is Silong.
The Freshmen, however. could not

[gain through the 'varsity line, and

only made ﬁrst down twice. in a halt-

The ‘varslly gained consistently on
long end rims by Barrett and sever-
