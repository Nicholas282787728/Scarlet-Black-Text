Many of the finest moments come
with these two on screen. The film's
great strength is derived from its
perception of the base character of
man, and at times these two
characters interact smoothly and
beautifully. The movie also analyzes
other consequences of this
baseness~man's curiosity of foreign
notions, his inability to accept them,
and his arrogance towards them.

The film is slightly dishonest in its
heavyrhanded treatment oi symr
bolism. For a film so basic and honest
in other areas, it Included 3 great
many subtle references to the conﬂict
between technology and nature, and
the corruption of Dersu's innocent
values. Although this might be con-
sidered the film’s theme, to me it
seems its {ailing point A Iew drops oi
sugar and an indication oi Dersu’s
place in the world would have been
good, but Kurosawa overdoes the
sweetness somewhat.

The acting is the films single iinest
aspect, with Munzuk leading the pack
During the show, i did not once see
him as an actor, his remarkable per-
formance totally convinced me that he
was Dersu. The others do nearly as
well. Cinematographically, the iilm
exploits the harsh beauty of the coun-
tryside perfectly, and matches the

Simple stance of the portraits of the
men.

The Film Committee has scheduled
iilms ior the exam period this year
and one of them is the James Bond
classic, Thuliderball. This time, Bond
(Sean Connery—probably the best
Bond there has been) tries to save on»
ly Miami (instead of the whole world,
as was the case with the more recent
Mooiiraker) from the em] clutches of
SPECTRE, which is planning to blow
it up with stolen nuclear warheads if it
isn‘t paid 100 million pounds sterling.

Once again, Bond manages to save
the day, between jumping in and out
oi bed with members oi the opposite
sex. The women are beautiful and the
gadgets are great. Bond's iamiliar
AustinrMartin makes an appearance,
but is quickly given up ior spear-guns
and underwater Jet packs as Bond
chases the eVll forces to their under-
water launching site,

The film was made in 1965, which
means that it is more believable than
the more recent attempts. The direc-
tors Of the last few Bond movies seem
to think that it. won't be exciting
enough if they don’t have lush under-

water homes (Man Willi lill‘ Golden
Gun) or attempts to take over the air
tire Earth tMooII 'el'). Tluiiltll‘i'buil
proves that this isn t true; ii anything,
it is more exciting because they dldn'l
get carried away with the sets or the
plot—the entire mOVle is more
realistic than the last few have been.

The other advantage that this pal»
ticular Bond has over the more recent
ones is that Connery doesn't seem
bored. In Moonrhkor, Bond seemed in
be just going through the motions,
which turns out to be very
unbelievable because he ran into the
most beautllul women and the most
sophisticated OVll that he had ever
seen. All of this combines to make
Thunderbolt the best Bond film. and
one which everyone will want to
see.~’l‘.S.

uiiioi-tunately, there were several
films which didn't arrive on campus in
time to be preVlewed {or this issue
Slimmer and Smoke (1961), an adaptar
tion oi the Tennessee Williams play
with reportedly strong acting, and The
Word is Out, the Gay Weekend iilm,
will be shown this weekend. The other
films for exam week are international
House (1933), a comedy starring WC
Fields, and Burns and Allen; and You
Can't Take It with Van (1938), a
somewhat dated film with James
Stewart and Lionel Barrymore.

Shepard’s stage--‘silly but not stupid’

by Chuck P/aller

Sam Shepard’s a iunny guy. Patti
Smith, Packards. and plays, and so
what if he wrecked his Renault wired
on bennles, the hawk moon shines
while he writes his first play on the
backs oi Tootsie Roll wrappers at the
age of 19. He wins his first Pulitzer
prize at the age of 36

Back Bog Beast Bait, written by a
Zavyearrold Shepard alter watching a
12-hour cowboy movie lest, eulogizes
the cinematic Old West in all its
grandeur and silliness, while
demonstrating its singular inaps
propriateness as a modern myth The
action of the play centers around the
aging gunfighter, Slim, and his
sidekick, Shadow, as they pursue “the
much heard about, but seldom seen,
pigbeast” into the “fearsome
lowlands” where they meet up with
voodoo magic and, along with the
other characters, meet iitling ends.

The ending oi the play is true to

, fashion for Shepard as he exploits

once again the disintegrationof cherish-
ed American institutions. In this case,
however, he seems to have gone even
further. The final scene draws aus
dience reactions ranging from “pure
poetry” to “just so much silliness.”

Student Director Bob Weiss, an-
ticipating such criticism, has gone on
record as the play’s iirst detractor:
“We tried to preserve the art without
being overwhelmed by the stupidity oi
it all," he said, and walked away mut-
tering emphatically about tidal waves

The play, along with three
monologues by Shepard, will be
presented in Arena Theatre tonight
and tomorrow night at 8:00 pm. and

on Sunday, a matinee at 2:00 p.m, The
cast consists of Will Gleason, Wendy
Turtun, Coco McPherson, Chuck Plate
ter, and Bob Weiss. structurally, the
play lacks the integration of Shepard‘s
later work, but the language is just as
vivid and idiomatic, evoking bizarre
hybrids oi meaning. Theateizgoers
should come prepared for a iree-ror-
all; no holds barred; no tickets re-
quired
