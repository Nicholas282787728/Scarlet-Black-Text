The World Trade organiaarion’s meering lasr week in searrle was, by

Ofeoiirso, rhe aers deserihed above were underraken by only a slim rriinoriry or
proresrers. The inaioriry ofrhe proresrors were labor leaders, environmenralisrs (wlrh
whom rhe labor leaders are usually in nrrer disagreemenrl, and sriidenr aerivisrs, all
ofwhom dislike free rrade and globaliaarlon. Pcrlmps rliosesrudenrsoughr ro spend
