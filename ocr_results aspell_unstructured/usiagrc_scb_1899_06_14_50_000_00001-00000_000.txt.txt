What is “lily commandment"? Again
in the reign oi larv is a progress toward
liberty. There are three stages in the
lric oi thc human race: the savage state,
where there is no law, the civil .cd state
consisting oi made laws, and the Chris-
tian state wins again there is no law.

The irrsi condi on iras tio use ior larvs,
since they would bebrolrcn ii tltey were
enacted, tiie second consists oi a long
process at learning to luakc and obey
laws: and the thirtl is beyond the ttccd oi
laws, hence tirey become not only an in
criiiibrance but ati aggressive hindrance.
This sho how philosophtcal anarchy.
rather than philosophical socialism is
right. The less human soctety has oi
legalism or lawism,the more there is apt
to he oi real reign of law. The degree
oi order rness oi a stage oicivrlitatioii is
not measurable by the si c oi the statute
book; quite the reverse may be true. A
large number oi laws is not improbable
