”aid Times Together,” Mr. Mayna-

Work on Goethe Forced

lnllo Second Place

Temporarily

The problem of mingling adminis-
trative work With the field of literr
aturc in which he has a, particular in-
telest, is onc of the foremost consid-
crctions for President John S. Nollen
this year.

Starting his first year as president
of Grinnell, he has found the ad—
ministrative burden sufficient to oc-
cupy his time. Vesper programs,
convocation, chapel services and a
variety of duties in connection with
the new class have kept him busy.

His chief literary interest, the
writing of the biography of Goethe,
German philosopher, has been forced
into secondary importance tempor-
arily.

Mr. Nollen has been collecting
fact: on the details on Goethe's life
for several years, but it was only
about a year ago that he began act—
ual work of writing the book. He was
dean of romance languages in Grina
hell and dean of the faculty at. that
time.

He had completed approximately c
third of the work before the death of
President J. H. T. Main, when he was
called upon to serve as acting presi-
dent. The trustees named him presi-
dent of the college at a meeting dur—
ing commencement in June.

Mr, Nollen has edited several texts
of German classics and followers of
his work had expected his book on
Goethe to Climax his Career as an
educator. He expects to continue to
work on the book as time permits.

noon. Myron Pilbruw and Hubllrt
Pyc, the only two returning lettera
men, were both absent, but will be

ed. but Coach Rosen will have ap-

proximately two weeks in which to,

round his men into shape. Pilbrow,
a junior, is the holder of the Missouri
Valley conference championship, and,
although there are no other outstand—
ing men, the squad will be well bal~
anccd.

Bures, Alfred Conard, Bub shoulbcrg.
Bill Ccnright, and Adrian ncWina
Gerhardt and Barber have both won
their letters in track, while Euros

Tackle Threat
Expected Back
on Team Soon

Coach Watt Sends Pioneers
Through Stiff Drill

Yesterday

News of the possible return of
)lﬂl'\ Trumbull, ISO-pound Soph-
omore tackle pr spect, to tile
tram within three weeks, has rais-
ed the hopes of the Pioneer foot-
ball squad this week.

’l‘rlllllllllll slightly injured his
shoulder, dislocated a year ago in
the State Teachers freshman
game, in practice F idny and was
for ed to retire from active par-

)atioil. A brace to hold the
shoulder in place has been Secur—
crl, however, and Coach L. D.
(Fuzz) Watt plans to have him
back in the lineup shortly.

Get Scrimmage

Coach Watt sent his gridmen
through their ﬁrst hard scrimmage
Tuesday and, despite rcggedness
characteristic of early season per-
formance, the team looked good.

Coach Watt used Thomas, Ullrich,‘
McCrcai-y, and Rose in the backﬁeld,
alternating them with Spanglcr,
Waite, Singer, and Alexander. Many
combinations were tried in the line,
Coaches Watt and Lester Duke con»
tinually shifting mcn.

Duncan at End

At the and positions, Edmau, Golz,
McKee, Crews, Welsh, and Duncan
saw service. Both McKee and Crews
looked good on defense. Canavan and
Bilto were used at the tackle posi-
tions most of the time, since Lake
was conﬁned to his bed with a slight
illness. Bilto is Grinnclrs only vetelu
an end, Rosenbloom, Piglcnd and
Graaund looked best at the guard
positions.

Captain Christoffersen is certain of

his center berth, and will probably

have St. John as an understudy. Mar-

tin, Gould, Erwin, and Santi were

used on defense most of the time.
Thomas Passing

Most of the Pioneer pass plays
worked well with Thomas doing the
passing. Ullrich cud McCreary also
looked good on the offense.

Coach Watt has less than two
weeks to prepare for the opening
game of the season with Coe college
here Sept. 25. The Kohawks, like the
Pioneers, will have a green line, al—
though they will be represented by
a veteran backﬁeld.

Peck Chairman
forFifth Radio
Audition Contest

David E. Peck, choir-moo of the
department of music at Grinnell col-
lege has again been appointed local
chairman of the fifth national radio
audition by the Atwater Kent foun-
dation of Philadelphia. He is now in<
cugurcting a campaign in Powcshick
county to ﬁnd a local singer who
mcy qualify to participate in the di—
vision of $25,000 in cash and 10 mu»
sical scholarships that will go to the
national ﬁnalists.

Contests will be lleld in individual
cities and towns throughout lowa
for the selection of local winners, one
man and one woman. From these the
state's contenders for territorial and
national honors, one man and one
woman will be selected.

From this point all expenses of
participants in the contest will be
borne by the Atwater Kent founda—
tion. The two state winners will be
taken to a district contest and be
placed in competition with the win—
ners from the other States in this
district. From among the state en-
trants, two district champions will
be chosen, Similar eliminotions will
be held in four other districts, in
contestants in all being qualified for

 

the ﬁnal audition.
