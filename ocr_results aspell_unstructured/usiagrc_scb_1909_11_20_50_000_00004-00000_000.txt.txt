Suggestions were made as to the

principles irpoir which art criticism isl

based. and the characteristics by which
dil’rci-clit schools of painting may be
distinguishcd the one from the other.
Some inter . ilig information “as also
given at to the various ways in which
great artists hud signed their paint,

rugs; and the relative value of ”oi-lg»

innls" replicas, and copies was touched
irpon.

The spenlrcr concluded by saying
that we have no reason for testing
that great art is dead 50 long as
nature, beauty, and religion inﬂuence
the rriinds and souls of men. so long
will an endure as an expression at
what is truest and loftiest. in human
hearts and lives.

Because at his foreign accept, it was
somewhat dimicult {or those seated in
tho bacl: part of the room to follow
all the lcctui . Nevertheless, Father
Rontaliclli irrrpr sod his audience as a
man or strong personality, thoroughly
equipped for his worlr. it was clearly
evident that Friday morning‘s lecture
was merely the overlloiv oi reservoir of
expert lcrrowlcdcg. 0n the ethical side
tlic discourse was also of great value.

Instead or providing a coursc at sev-
eral lectures this year as hcrctotorc,
the Art Committee of the Faculty in-
\‘ited Rev, Victor Romanelli to give the
chapel address on the morning or
November is, and speak on the general
subjeit of Art Criticism.
