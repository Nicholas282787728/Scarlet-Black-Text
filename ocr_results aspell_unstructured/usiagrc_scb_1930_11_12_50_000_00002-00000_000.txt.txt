HARRY T. BRUNDI'DGE

Harry T. B ndidgc, Russell G, Owen, and
Capt. Hubert Wilkins are three members of the
fourth estate whose names have been best known
to newspaper renders during the lust year. Blurb
didgc’s disclosures of graft ill the Chicago press
after the murder of Alfred “Jake” Lillglc, Owen‘s
daily reports of the Byrd Antarctic expedition,
and W'ilkius’ Wireless stories of the flight around
the world by the Graf Zeppelin were the biggest
assignments covered by individual newspaper rer
porters in recent years.

Mr. Brundidge will be the principal speaker here
Friday afternoon at the annual convention of the
Iowa. High School Press association. Delegates,
college students, visiting newspaper men, and the
general public are fortunate to be able to hear
about “Adventures in Newspaper Reporting” from
.a man who is still working on the story which
helped to make him famous. He appreciated being
asked to tell something of the practical side of
newspaper work to high school journalism enthus-
iasts. and expressed additional gratitude when he
learned that he would be the guest of the college
Where one of his closest chums, Gary Cooper,
studied.

Brundidge was the one newspaper reporter
who was able to get an interview with Al Capone
at his Miami, Fla., home on the crime situation in
Chicago. Capone warned the St. Louis Star reporter
that he would deny his statements if they were
printed, but the threat and possibility of being a
“marked man” did not keep Brundidgc from writ-
ing his interview for publication. The story was
printed copyrighted, and syndicated.

His address in Herrick chapel at 2:30 Friday
afternoon should be well attended. Stones from
a writer who was responsible for the disclosure of
a national diploma mill, graft in the Chicago press,
and the nation wide publicity given the Thomas
Mooney case in California will never be boring.

ONE CLASS~ONE MINUTE

Armistice day was observed in Grimlell college
yesterday—When one lane instructor stopped work
for a minute at 11 o’clock to allow the students
to spend the minute hollering America’s dead of
the World war.

The Scarlet and Black suggested Saturday that
the matter of a minute’s observance of Armistice
day be taken up in the faculty meeting Monday.
No action was taken, however, and only a. single
professor departed from the routine path of class
work.

Possibly Armistice day should not be observed
as a legal holiday. The world has certainly reached
a point where the glory of war no longer holds a
place in the hearts of men. But is a student’s time
or a professor’s lecture so important that one min»
utc could not be spared in honor of those who lost
their lives serving the country?

‘HOMECOIVHNG PLAY TONIGHT"

The Homecoming program included the usual
football game, class reunions, chapel program, and
had an added attraction in the person of Zana Gale.
However one feature greatly missed was the Home-
coming play. The Friday night football game
crowded out the chance for a production, so tonight
and tomorrow night “The Perfect Alibi,” under
direction of Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, will be
given in the Alumni Recitation hall auditorium.

The Grilmcll chapter of National Collegiate
Players, with the assistance of the dramatic pro-

Agrs before Atllclls was even founded, Johnny
Stollellatellct was running llll‘Ollgll the ueolilllic

OVERHEATED LIBRARY ROOMS

At it recent meeting of tllo Lantern the possi
bililv of nlloviating tllc chl‘llMtod condition ol' the
libl‘a v reading TODHIS was discussed. The fact was
drawn to the attention of the orgmli ition by many
sindcllis who like to study iu the library, but who
find the temperature at times uncomfortable.

Whether or not the Lantern has taken any ac~
lion upon the investigation, smoothing ought to be
done to keep the reading rooms at a temperature
more conducive to good study and concentration.
A number of students have formed the habit of
siudyillg in their rooms or elsewhere, but \\'l\Cl'l
professors make assignments which can be obtained
only from reserve material, the library must be
used. The library is probably the best: place to
study, for there is not much noise to distract mic’s
attention, and many references and other source
llliltcl'ial are at hand.

Scientists and doctors have concluded that the
best illclilal work is done in a room wllcre the
temperature is near 70 degrees. The e is no doubt
but that the library rooms exceed this during the
greater part of the (lay lit least. For best concen-
tration and studytlle reading rooms should be kept
as nearly as possible to 70 or perhaps 75 degrees.

YOUNG EDITORS OF HARVARD
(From the Chimgo Tribune)

For a month or so the Harvard daily, the Crimson,
has drawn attention by criticism of activities having a
patriotic background or purpose. It referred to the Amer—
ican Legion convention in Boston as a brawl. Later it
said that the courses in naval and military science were
unworthy of the university and a haven and refuge for
dull and lazy students. The young editors are impatient
in observsnon of nationalism and its manifestations.

Many schools apparently produce cults in which the
virtue of loyalty is regarded as primitive and unintelli-
gent and patriotism the refuge of the feebleuninded.
This has considerable pedagogical encouragement and
inspiration, and young people, highly conscious of their
liberalism, respond actively. That old nations are dis-
creditable may be quite apparent to young liberals who
may be more certain of themselves now than they will
be later,

Harvard has had a great record in these loyalties,
although Memorial hall. wnieb symbolized some of them,
seems to have faded out of the uses of the university.
Older Harvard men found something worthy in the
tablets of its transept, but probably the editors of the
Crimson would be bored. The young liberals are natur-
ally the most vocal of student groups, and may give an
impression of a university which its normal thought
does not support, but the impression is created of im-
maturity manifest as snobbery. If it should be a reflec-
[ion of an entire student body, it would question the
