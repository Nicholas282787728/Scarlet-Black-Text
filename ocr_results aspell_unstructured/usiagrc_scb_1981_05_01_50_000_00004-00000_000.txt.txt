Profs say “F” will affect seriousness

by Kim MacDonald

The “F” is a grade which hasn't been
seen on a Grinnell transcript in almost
12 years Recently, the faculty passed a
proposal by a 5-3 margin to reinstate
the failure grade. Almough the change
will not occur until the 1982-83 academic
year, how will the reinstatement of the
“1"" grade affect current freshmen and
sophomores who will be here to feel the
effects?

For the first semester this year, 7A]
grades of “No Credit" were received by
students. This figure, which accounts
for four percent of the 5,424 grades
given to 1,260 studens, includes not on-
1y students who tailed a course but also
those who unofficially dropped a class
by not showing up for the final and
those who did not maintain a grade of
”C" or better in a CR/NC class.

Maxine Paul, the college registrar,
stressed, ”You can’t tell how many
students failed” and the college has no
way of knowing which students actually
failed a class or decided to drop it at the
last minute. Four percent ol the grades
received by students first semester last
year were also NC. However, according
to Paul’s computer figures, in 1967-68
when the “F" grade was still in ex-
istence, one percent of 4,760 grades
given were tailures,

when asked about how they thought
the reinstatement of the “F” grade
would affect students, several pro»
Lessors did not feel mere’would be any
major changes. ”The vast majority or
students are not in danger of getting an
‘F",” according to mathematics Prof.
Charles Jepsen. “For the small number
that are, it will limit their choices of
courses , , .l they'll be taking safer
courses."

Assistant Prof. of English Liahna
Babener also noted, “When students
find out that very few 1" s are actually
given, dieir longrterm anxiety will
dissipate." She understood that “in the
short run” the “r" grade “might in
timidate students" and saw the
possibility of "shorvterm anxiety"
students may feel regarding the “F”
grade. Political science Prof. Walter
Stone also felt me “F" grade “would
not affect very many students.”

Some profs anticipate a change in the
way students will select courses when

the “F“ grade reappears “It will en-
courage students to weigh their choice
of courses more carefully," said
French Prof. Victor Verrette. Clifford
Reid of the economics department cons
curred in saying, “Students will be
more selective in the courses they
choose.” Stone does not feel this will
have a desirable effect and Dean of
Faculty Catherine Frazer noted that
the absence of an “r" grade was
originally intended to encourage
students to explore different fields.

It appears that profs expect students
to become more serious about their
work when the “F" grade is reinstated
“ once they do decide to take a
course, they will probably be more
dedicated," Reld’anticipates. Students
“will read syllabi more carefully," ac
cording to Verette, who added, “there
will be less lead room for students to
play around with a course."

A “desirable effect of the grade,"
Stone noted, “is that students will be
more attentive to the demands of a
course." On the other hand, there is the
possibility that more students will drop
courses rather than receive an “F”
before the ninth week of the semester.
”I doubt in be giving very many, if
any. “F"s at the end of the semester
since more people will be dropping,"
said Jepsen.

Student reaction appears to be mixr
ed. While the Curriculum Committee
favored die proposal, the majority of
students on that panel are seniors and,
thus, will not be affected by the grade
itself but are artected by the way
graduate schools view the Grinnell

transcript. One of the initial reasons for
the proposal was that a
Grinnell transcript lacks credibility
since it does not reflect a student's
overall academic career Paul explain»
ed that some schools are suspicious of a
12»credit semester on a Grinnell
transcript and will write to a student lor
an explanation and possible verlficar
tion that the student didn't fall a class.

Other schools, the University of iowa
in particular, according to Paul, will
automatically average in four hours of
“F” credit if they see a lZcredit
semester. Frazer also agreed that there
were “some problems" with graduate
schools. But she felt that with the “F"
grade a Grinnell G.P.A, “will have bet
ter accuracy.” She explained the
change using a metaphor, “It's like a
bicycle, when you tighten a few bolts on
a bicycle, you're still riding a three-
speed." She also noted that reinstate-
ment of the “1“" grade is a nationwide
trend and the Stanford University
laculty will be voting on it this month.

The “F" grade is ”not deliberately
punitive," stressed Frazer and this
seems to be me sentiment among the
faculty, “l have glven NCS but never
without a great deal ot agonizing and
careful consideration . . . the ‘F’ is not
a penalty," explained Babener. It ap-
pears that even with an “r" grade
which appears on student transcripts
there will be very little change in the
way profs evaluate students for, as
Reid, one prof who expects no change in
his system of grading, explained.
“There is an 1" grade now,"
