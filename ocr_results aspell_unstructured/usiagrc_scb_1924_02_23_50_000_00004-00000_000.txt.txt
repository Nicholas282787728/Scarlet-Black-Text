may be compensated by the fact this
is England's prize novel for the year.

already grasped the plot. You see an
English girl has gotten her-sell ene

plane cruise to Australia with u
stokes book, EFFICIENCY IN

falls in the ocean and they are maroon-
ed on an island, The two seem to be
experienced marooneders. They have
gone through the customary process of
estimating the size of the island and
speculating on the presence of natives.
They have also decided that it isn’t
much of a commercial discovery, be—
cause they can’t tind any cobrs, cop-
ra, copper-as or whatever the stuff
it. The next number on the program
seems to be a teeth—gnashing duet,
