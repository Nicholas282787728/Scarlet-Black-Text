HE students are indebted to Mr.

and generosity, by means or which
the Sparrlding prize is made possible.
Mir. Spaulding is one of the men

nell as a poor boy, he has by hard work
and perseverance built up abusiness

UMORS have been arloat the past

few days to the ecfcot that the
Town Collcgo band had disbanded or
was going to on account of lack of
interest on the pare of the members.
Wcsincerely hope that this report Is
untrue and llilitiLis founded on ric—
tion rather than facts The band is
an organization which does not de-
pond on the season [or its popularity
but thrircs the whole year. Tire hand
has done excellent work during the
past football season and we were all
proud of it. The college needs a band
now just as much as it ever did. The
basket ball and baseball games and
track events, all demand the presence
of the band in the same way thabclre
rootball games did. There seems to
be no lack of material and if the
players will only show alittle public
spirit, we will predict thataband will
be organized that will be a credit to
the institution.
