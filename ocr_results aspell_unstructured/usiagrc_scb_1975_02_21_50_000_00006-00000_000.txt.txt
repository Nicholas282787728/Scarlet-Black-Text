“I think the food service has
improved a lot since i started here,
mainly because there are
unlimited seconds now. The iood
may not be exactly what they
want, but they can get all they
wantl”

So says Jo Kyle, who yesterday
celebrated her thirtieth ans
niversary of working [or Saga. A
familiar tigure on the serving line.
Jo started out working on the dish
crew. She then set tables when
there still were sit-down meals,
and has since been working on the
serving line, Alter thirty years, Jo
is somewhat philosophical about
her job and working with students.
She says “Ninety per cent or the

students are good workers for Saga
and most oi the students that go
through the line are good kids,
Some of 'em complain but you can
always tell the ones that are just
kiddin‘ and kid back at ’em,”

In her thirty years or working at
Cowles, Jo has seen quite a iew
changes. When she first came, the
dining hall served only family
style meals, and there were no
seconds except at the training
tables for athletes. At that time
Cowles served only men and
everyone was required to wear a
coat and tie to dinner. During her
tenure, do has seen at least seven
managers come and go, “and
maybe more; it's hard to

remember ’em all." She thinks

that although every manager has.r

new ideas on how the dining hall
should be run, many things are
unchanged since she started. While
physical things have changed, such
as the substitution of plastic dishes
for china ones, and bigger and
newer dish machines put in,the
baSlc food preparation is still
pretty similar.

hiter thirty years, Jo has
deﬁnite preferences as far as her
work schedule and the meals that
she likes to work. She now works
every day except Friday and every
other Saturday or Sunday irom 11
am. to around 7:15 p,m,, when the
dish Crew leaves. J0 said with a
smile, “I like to work the lunch and
dinner meals so that I can sleep
late in_the morning ,,

Asked about the new Saga policy
or doing away with the seconds
Cart this year, Jo said. “I don’t
really mind having to serve

seconds from the line so long as ‘

people are polite and don’t try to
Crowd in line. I like to keep the
main line going at the same time,
so it makes it hard when people out
in line.”

Anyone who has wandered in
from an TM softball game with his
cap on has quickly learned a lesson
in manners rrom Jo. She says, “I
just think it’s a rule of general
politeness for men to remove their
hats in the serving line and I won't
tolerate smoking in the serving
line ” Other than these rules, do is
usually genial with the students
coming through and can call an
amazing number bv name. She
boasts, “I’ve served a previous
Dean of the College and the present
Director of Admissions and I still
call them by their first name when
they come through the line,”
