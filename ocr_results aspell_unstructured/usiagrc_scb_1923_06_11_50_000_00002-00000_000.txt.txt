TO THE ALUMNI.
The alumni returning to Grinnel‘l

i

may see certain changes in their
Alma Mater. It is only natural for
then] to compare the institution today
with the institution when they were‘
undergraduates. It is proverbial that
they should be, partial to the latter.
And Why not? Each class believes
that its sojourn in Grinnell marked
the Golden Age of the college e and
every one of them is right
. . .

Growth is the test or bite. And
when the seniors come to graduate
each year, they should see that Grin-
neil has made some advance during
the four years that have turned them
from freshmen into graduates. And.
hﬂﬂﬂhéy' donut the advance"‘con-
tinues. classes may come and classes
may go, but the college goes on lor—
ever serving the needs or the Middle
West.

a o .

So to those oi the alumni, who sense
a low changes here and there within‘
our campus borders. we say that these
are but a continuation or the changes
which they themselves wrought in
their undergraduate days. Adaptation
to new conditions, expansion to meet
steadily growing demands for service
and inspiration are the tests or his in
a college. Grinn'cll has been progress—
ing year by year—but always along the
route staked out in the hearts of the'
pioneer band to which it owes its‘

inception l

Each class that graduates adds its
mite to the development of a greater
Grinneil. We owe an overwhelming
debt of gratitude to those who have
gone before us, who have reared our
college walls, who have laid the (nuns
dations oi Grinnell as a distinctive
liberal arts college, who by word and
deed have spread her mine and time
throughout the nation and even across
the seats. We gladly render homage
to themetn the Alumni and to tho

Faculties o! the Fist and Present.

is impossible to reform our national
or state governments until our local
organizations are more nearly perv,
tect’;the American people must get‘
the idea of service thoroughly into1
their minds before any form or gov-

‘ernment will function to sattsrnction

‘ Mr. Barnes. 2 senior. spoke on the
College Man and the languid of Na-
tions. In reviewing the Work of the
League, he maintained that it, was a
vital, functioning organization. and
that it is the dutyl oi the college man
to lead the nation from its present
isolation into is league at world bro-
therhood.

Mr, Clovis, a. junior, spoke on the
need for unemployment lnusrance. He
told how the British government had
‘luade unemployment insurance com—
Dulsory. and be advocated the adoption
in the United States of a slmilitl" syse
