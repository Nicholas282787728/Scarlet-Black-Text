On Wednesday evening and the weekend of the 121h, Grinnell viewers will be given the unusual opportunity
to see the original version and the remake of a film. Performing Arts is sponsoring the original; SGA, the
remake ofCape Fear. The two filmsare quite different. Anyone interested in film should find the comparison
very interesting, especime since the original has been compared favorably to the camera work of Orson
Welles’ Citizen Kane. The original story of a convicted rapist, who comes back to terrorize the family of the
man who testiﬁed againsthim, is notable forits cast, which includes Gregory Peck,Robert Mitchum andTelly
Savalas. The score is by Bernard Hermann of Psycho. Mitchum, as the psychopath, turns in a portrayal of
rancid villainy, slouching around with halfused stogy, in shirttailsand Panamahat. Director}. Lee Thompson

Van Sant’s new film creates
"waves of discussion"

By Laura Moran

It‘s true—theGiinncll FilmsCom—
mittee has actually gotten a good,
recent movie that everyone has been
wanting to see to show this Friday in
the Harris Center. Assumably,some»
one in the ordering room misplaced
their glasses and checked the wrong
box. They probably meant to get us
Rirky Business again, but save your
tears for later and get out tonight and
take advantage of this unusual situa»
tion.

Director Gus Van Sant's My Own
Private Idaho (the title was inspired
by the B»52’s song) has been creating
waves of discussion among film crit-
ics since its September release.

Loosely based on Shakespeare’s
Henry IV. the movie follows young
hustlers Scott (Keanu Reeves— Bill
And Ted's Excellent Adventure, The
River'sEdge)and MikemiverPhoe-
nixi Stand By Me, ) as they wander
through Portland, Seattle, rural Idaho,
and Italy.Scottisarebellious mayor’s
son who pals around with Portland's
hustlers and drug users, and Mike is
his gay. narcoleptic best friend,
searching for love, the mother who
abandoned him, and the father he
never knew.

Gus Van Sant is one of the most
original directors on today’s Ameri»

can film scene. A graduate of the
Rhode Island School of Design, Van
Sant’s first feature film was the black
and white 1986 Maia Noche. based
on a novella by Portland writer Walt
Curtis. Far from extravagent, the en-
tire film was created on atiny $20,000
budget withdrawn from Van Sant’s
savings account. Despite the critical
acclaim Van Sant received for Mala
Noche. he went largely unnoticed by
the general public until his second
movie, Drugstore anboy.
Drugstore Cowboy was inspired
by the then-unpublished autobiogra-
phy of James Fogle, a man who’d
spent more titan half of his life in
reform schools and prisons for drug
felonies (and who, incidentally, is
back in the slammer at present, after
the police found him in a hotel room
with his girlfriend, his probation
officer’s phone number. and $10,000
worth of ill»gotten phannacuticals).
Without indulging in sloppy senti»
mentality, the movie chronicles the
adventures of a group of down»and»
out drug addicts (led by Matt Dillon)
who travel the country robbing phar-
macies in order to supply their habits.
Drugstore Cowboy won the Na-
tional Society of Film Critics‘ awards
forBestPicture.BestScreenplayand
Best Director of 1989. upstaging
Steven Sodcrbcrgh’s Sex, Lier, and

Videotapes, as well as Spike Lee’s'
Do the Right Thing. _
After Drugstore Cowboy. Van
Sant received numerous offers for’
making his next project, some com»,
plete with multi-millton dollar bud-
gets and stars attatched, including A] ‘
Pacino and Tom Hanks. However, he,
turned them all down to try his first
original screenplay, My Own Private '
Idaho \
My Own Private Idaho can be
viewed on several levels. The‘
Shakespearean aspects of it are obvi~ .
ous, even for those not familiar with‘
Henry IV. The movie has numerous
surreal scenes of depressed Portland >
areas where the characters speak in ,
grandiloqucnt Shakespearean lan-
guage, white Elizabethan recorder '
music wheezes in the background. At )
one point, Scott says, combining ‘
Shakespeare’s language and time
imagery with the words of Portland’s .
drug and prostitution scene, “Why, .
you wouldn’t even look at a clock,
unless hours were lines of coke, dials '
looked like designs of gay bars. or .
time itself was a fair hustler in black
leather. . .isn‘t that right, Bob?”
As unbelievable as it may sound in :
print, the blend succeeds on screen, .
