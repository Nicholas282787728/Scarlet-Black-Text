Grinnell-in-China
Drive To Begin in
Early February

A drive to raise runds for the
Grinnellein-Chlna movement will
be conducted early in February,
Dr. John S. Everton, dean of
chapel, said today.

Gni'mell-ianhina is a term used
to describe an educational de-
velopment in North China which
has been carried out and financed
largely by Griunell college.

The school is located in Techow
in the province of Shantung, now
under Japanese occupation. Ac»
cording to Everton, however, last
reports indicate that the school
is still in operation.

This school is especially valuv
able new because it affords a
great opportunity for inﬂuencing
leaders responsible for future
leadership of China, Everton said.
