0 Blame It 011 the Weekend.

We're sorry, but in the main, we are pretty
well satisfied with things right now.

True, we are a trifle irritated at the lack
of interest ili student government. (See be
low.) And the thought of several term pap-
ers which keep piling up on us is discon-
certing. Furthermore, the future looks a
little uncertain. But, all in all, life looks
pretty good.

It must have been the weekend.

Yes, we’re sure it was.

First Tiny Hill and hisorchestl‘a were re»
sponsible, with the aid of the Gadabouts,
for one of the best dances of the year Fri-
day night.

Then Saturday afternoon was the begin:
ning of no classes for the next 42 hours.
That same evening, the combined Spaulding
Speech contest and Amateur show brought
forth a varied program of entertainment.

All this, plus many hours of sleep made it

Perhaps we can dig up some gripes after
vacation.

0 N0 Fangs.

In former years we would be writing this
editorial with a sign of relief tinged with
sadness. For then we would be shedding our
journalistic ermine to join the editors in
blissful retirement.

Then, with spring vacation terminating
our faithful service to the Scarlet and
Black, we would be gracefully making our
exit before the onslaught of idealistic, en»
tliusiastic youth. Then, with all due respect
to our successors, we would feel compelled to
draw from our fund of experience for a few
words of kindly advice.

This ye ‘ we are to be spared this pain
ful experience till the end of the school
year. We shall carry on, happy in the
knowledge that we are serving a thriying
and energetic newspaper.

0 Where, 011 Where!

Students cry fo- student government. They
knock the administration and faculty when
they do not comply with student opinion.
Yet when the students have the opportun-
ity thrown in their laps to voice their
opinions, they pass it by.

For years student representation at gen—
eral assemblies and class meetings has been
poor. But wllen less than one-half of the
necessary quorum turns out to elect class
representatives to the Student council, there
is cause to question the validity of student
government Perhaps the powers that be
should forbid class representation in the
Student council. In that case, student gov-
ernment might not be taken for granted but
rather respected.

True, students will go all-out in a Student
council presidential election, but then they
feel their job is done. Have they forgotten
that the president must have some student
opinion other than heresay on which to
act.

The Student council as a whole represents
the students as they want to be represented.

However, this smuu sound was
probably lost in the general
sounds of gentle shoring, rising

The great mystery on third floor
ARH during these times of lime
news is the question of where the
swinging doors of the ARH men’s
smokers have gone?

For years they were there,
swinging in and out, banging
an minimal nostril, or slap
ping an occasional feature on
the icbouhd.

And then, overnight, they
were gone, spirited away like
a Rosenblat in the third
Reich.

What’s behind this sudden
move? Is there a defense
demand for swinging
down?
If anyone has any ideas, please
forward them to the Scarlet and

In the back row a couple inter-
esting games of race—horse rum»

lplying sweaters for soldiers at
the expense of their own educa-
tion. This is very noble indeed.

It must be the inﬂuence or the

their exercises outside.

JOBS...

For those who are wondering what to do during a war—time
summer vacation, here’s a suggestion: Check with your post
office for tips from your nearest Civil Service field office on
temporary jobs. In addition to whatever openings might
normally appear, theie are repolts that offices of “decentral-
ized" government agencies are short-handed. Hundreds of
their employes elected to stay behind in over-crowded Wash»
ington rather than move into “the field.”

WAR . . .

Look for “reactivation” of CAA training programs in some
_100 colleges and universities where the CAA program had
been allowed to lapse. The expanded program for next year,
announced recently by CAA and the War Department, will
require use again of dormant college facilities, and possibly
establishment of new ones, too. Goals are for an increase
of 20,000 in both elementary and secondary training cours—
es. Men who are accepted will acquire status as enlisted
reserves in the air corps or will, on finishing, serve as
CAA flying instructors.

Signs point to a ma, r Washington effort to sell the Uni-
versity of Iowa's “Phoenix Fund" post-war scholarship plan
to all U. S. colleges. If the idea can be “cleared" through
Treasury department bigwigs, the Department‘s Defense
Savings section will attempt to get a national educator-5’ com»
mittee to back the plan. This committee, in turn, would at
tempt to build up well-oiled organizations in colleges through-
out the country this Spriug and Summer preparatory to a
campaign splurge when Fall terms open.

Briefly, the Iowa plzm provides that each student buy a 10
cent Defense Savings Stamp each week to build up pegbwrlr‘

'scholm-shl‘p fmlds for students in the armed forces.

Treasury officials consider the plan the best collegiate stamp-selling
idea to date, and frankly admit they have no suggestions for improvise
meht. Credit for the original idea goes to Francis Weaver, first-year
law student at Iowa.

ON THE BIAS . . .

The Federal Register points out that Stockton Junior college and Mo-
destn Junior college in California have moved to Carson City, Nev.,
"by reason of the emergency existing in California caused by the
present state of war.”

INCIDENTALLY . . .

Maryland’s Hood college, in relaxing its rules to permit mar-
ried girls to attend school, observed that the move is an ef-
fort to adjust “to situations arising from the war emer-
gcncy.“
