Student recounts encounter
with a "high school bully"

To the Editor:

After my arrival hero in
August of 1987, I thought that
Grinnell was the typical peaceful
mid»Amcrican town. much more
peaceful than typical. People
smiled at me everywhere, and I
had reason to believe that town
natives oozed their good spirits
into most students But, alas, as
anyone that saw "Bluc Vclvct"
can lcll, evcry happy small town
has a wcllrhiddcn hideous secret.
last Saturday night I discovered a
darker side of thc peace-loving,
progressive student body. I met
the Legendary High School Bully
alive and kicking at Grinnell.

My experience started
innocently enough to let me
think that it was ajoke. I was at
another successful Gardner party,
I was sitting at the counter in
Hector's, enjoying my third beer
and a cigarette, when a carefully
assembled concatenation of four-
leLtcr words hit my ears. Amazcd
by the thought of a Grinnell stu-
dcnt exhibiting such cxuberancc
in explctivc usagc, I glanced at
Ihe speaker, who was sitting next
to me. He was a lanky young-
stcr, probably somebody in his
late icons. He got excited when I
turned my head, and continued
with a commentary on how some
**** likcd to puff smoke right
into his face. Some of his
fricnds, equally intoxicated, cn-
couragcd him [0 go on. It took
me some seconds to react. I told
him that he was at a party, that
there was no smoking section,
and that I was sorry, but I hope
pcncd to bc a smoker.

His face turned red. God!
A reaction! Just what he wanted!
He told me that he had been sit-
ting there for three **** hours
and that he wasn't going to move
just because somebody wanted to
“H smokc right there and
lacked courtesy. [just turned
away. Some people started to
notice his drunken. Slirilly

speech. peppered with assorted
cxplctivcs. Ijusr. rcpcalcd thaii
was not planning on moving
He went on with some elabora-
tions about "" common cour-
tesy. I turned and said that I
didn't mind (his behavior) because
he was obviously drunk, and
probably a freshman, given his
lack of knowledge of smoking
regulations. ( I do not rcmcmbcr
ever seeing his face, so this was,
I thought, a good guess).

.A gush of adrenalin shook
his body. ”“l! "A ***"
freshman, uhll", he shouted
"I‘m ajunior, and I won't have no
N“ sophomore telling me what
to do!" He launched into another
wild expedition to the unmappcd
frontiers of English language
profanity, I simply turned away,
Ialkcd to some fricnds, gave some
cigarettes away. Some pcoplc
tried to pacify him. They talked
to mc, I told them that I had no
intentions of lighting or even ar-
guing; [just wanted to sit at the
party and smoke if I felt like it.

Then, the Caped Security
Avcngcr came to thc rescuc. To
Ihc rescue of the wild and intoxi-
Catcd. that is. After talking for a
while to thc Bully, he approached
me and asked me to move. He
said that I was doing 'somclhing'
that was disturbing 'somcbody'. I
told him that my unexpected
party neighbor was evidently
drunk, that he did not mind the
smoke: he just wanted a fight. I
told him that I had the right to
smoke there, and that I had not
moved becauscl had cxpcclcd at
lcast a polite request, He insistcd
until I spelled out for him that he
could not force me to do anything
because I was not disturbing
anyoncl While we argued, I nor
liced some people who were

smoking just two or three feet
away from my aggressor. His
sensitive nostrils did not seem to
perceive the smoke of their
cigarettes.

Tho Avenger dcpartrxl. For
the next ten minutes, the Bully
carried on his performance. He
mentioned that the security guard
was a good friend of his, asked
him repeatedly to kick me out,
made fun of my jacket and my
accent and followed me into
Gardner, shouting warnings,
when I tapped him on the shoul-
der and said goodbye.

What bothers 'me the most
is the immaturity and lack of
proper understanding displayed by
the security guard. Certainly I
was smoking-as it was my right-
-and perhaps bothering somebody
else. But that somebody dis
played a bchavior so aggressive
that it could only be attributed to
alcohol, to an urge to fight, or to
both And what do you do with
somcbody at a Gardner party who
is drunk and wants to fight'.7 Do
you kick out his target? I wonder
what would have happened if the
Bully had disliked the smell of
my lotion or the shape of my
eyes. Would the security guard
have asked me to take a shower
or an appointment with :t plastic
surgoon?

I just hope that common
scnsc predominates on further
appearanccs of the High School
Bully. Otherwise, we‘ll have
more stupid, immature situations
like this onc, and I think that
Grinnell is already tcnsc cnough
for all of us. David Tavarez,
