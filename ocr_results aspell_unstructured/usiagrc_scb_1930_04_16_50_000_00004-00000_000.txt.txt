Quad Debates '
Get Under Way

Five Defeats Central Last
Night on Question of

Summer School.

Cottage Five was victorious over
Central last night in the first 70f a
series of interecottage debates on
the subject “Resolved that Grinneil
should offer summer School.” Each
of the six cottages will debate an-
other on the same subject, the win-
ners of the final debate, which will
be held in the middle of next week.
presented with a cup. Cottage Two
was the winner of the reward last
year. the first time that these de~
batea had been held,

Cottage Five’s negative team was
composed of Mary Lark, Kathryn
Sampson, and Alberta Curtis. Cen-
tral's team was Edith Jones, Lydia
McDaniel, and Elinor Carrington.
Wednesday night Cottage Three's
Squad, Marguerite McFarlin, Helen
Larrabee, and Polly Parker will lie»
bate Two, represented by Georgia
Murray, Winifred Kelch. and Kath-
erine Perring.’ Thursday, Cottage
Four's team, Myrna Adams, Marcia
Cahalan, and Mary Eleanor Hoyt,
opposes Mear's trio, Winifred Webe
ster. Mary I—Iayes, and Doris Long.
Dorothy Nelson, president of the
Women's Forensic, is chairman of
the debates, and Francis Hawk, and
Miss v. E. Grubbs serve as judges.

Central-s affirmative team last
night believed that summer school
would be successful because it meets
a real need for those financially un-
able to compete schooling otherwise,
and for those detained during the
winter term by sickness, travel or
failure. and also for those who dev
sire to, and have the ability, to come
plete school in less than the usual
four years. By continuing at Grin-
nell during the summers, the stud-
ents are assured of not repeating
and omitting work under their fav»
orite professors. The instructors,
by teaching longer terms, may be
able to take more extensive Vacar
tions. Professors from other
schools will bring their views to
the campus. At the same time. the
buildings and equipment which are
here anyway, will be used.

Cottage Five's negative trio as-
serted that Grinnell should not offer
summer school because it was un-
necessary, unpractical, and undesir-
able. Grinnell is well-enough aide
vertised in .this section of the coun—
try without a
six short weeks, representative Grin-
nell spirit could not be developed in
the temporary students, and the stue
dent government could not be main-
tained at the high standard. If
Grinnell students wish to go to sum-
mer school they could go where
there are better advantages, where
There are longer terms, and where it
is less expensive, getting broader
ideas to bring back to Grinnell in the
fall.

l Campus Opinion

Question: Why don’t Grlnnell stu-
dents go to church otocner?

Kenneth Clayton—Most of them
are away from home and don't feel
any inclination to go without their
families.

Joan BusbyﬁThere’S little in Grin-
nell churches to interest them. The
services are obviously directed to the
congregations which support the
churches, not to college students.

Frank Furbusllione is not par-
ticularly impressed by the ludicrous
analogies offered by local members
of the clergy.

Miriam nlanlly—Chapel and yes
pers satisfy their religious needs so
that they don't need the churches.

Walter SecuriMost students are-
n’l: satisﬁed with what the local
churches offer. Local sermons are.
n’t stimulating. _

Mary Ellen simvely—The sermons
don‘t appeal to students.

Donald Johnston—Students ﬁnd
that the material which is given for
all classes of people is not especially
needed by them in a college life
which contains religious Services for
the students.

Louine Morris—So many people
