In what has become a traditional migration down south,
the Grinnell Ultimate Frisbee tcﬂms¥tlw Grinncllcphants
and the sticky Tongue Frogs7travellcd to Baton Rouge,
Louis. to participate in the Mardi Gras Ultimate Tourna-
ment on Feb. 2,3_ The Maidi Gras touinament is one of the
largest in the country with over 100 teams from collcgcs and
universities participating.

Thirteen members ofthc men's team and 10 of the wom—
en's crammed themselves into cars for the standaid 15 hour
drive. But blizzards, fog, vagrant deer, iaccoons and “thun-
dersnow” extended the travel time for most cars to almost
21 hours. The trek down soutliidcspitc travel time, missed
classes, and the physical toll7was a highly worthwhile one.

“You spend almost an entire day in a small box with only
a few other people,"
said Conor McGee ’08.
"When you've been
travelling for that long,
and you're that sleep—
deprived, it can lead to
some pretty ‘crackcdr

Since Sectionals and
rcgionals are held in early April hctorc Iowa weather tends
to permit much outdoor practice, the chance to play outside
for the first time since the falliand in 70 degree weather, no
lessrwas another key benefit of attending the tournament.
For the Sticky Tongue Frogs, carrying a small number of
players to the tournament afforded everyone signiﬁcant playr
ing time and a chance for major personal improvement while
htcoming really familiar with each other's playing styles.
“With a smaller group, only three or four substitutes, you
really get used to playing with each other, you get in a flow,"

said co-captain Katie Johnson '08. “For everyone, the im-
provement wasjust really noticeable."

The Sticky Tongue Frogs were powered by the youth
movement at this tournament, as six of the ten players were
firstryears. Alex l-leierhapdelaine ’11 enjoyed the chance to
play a new position and get more practice with the disc.

“I got to practice handling, which was a new position for
me, and overall I feel like everyone had a good experience,"
she said. “We all feel so much more conﬁdent."

Because of the structure of collegiate ultimate frisbee,
there are no divisional separations, meaning that a small
school like Grinnell frequently faces national powerhouses

such as University of Wisconsin—Madison or University of
Texas, Both Grinnell teams, however, hung with such schools
and earned wins on the weekend. The Sticky Tongue Frogs
posted a record ofzri, while the Grinnellephants were 3-2.

But the Grinnellephants saw even more action in the ER.
Three players were injured over the course of the tournar
merit: Nathan Levin '10, endured a sprained ankle; Nathaniel
Schroeder Y11, a sprained knee; and McGee, a broken col-
larbone.

“l was coming offrny mark to make a play on the disc [in
the match against Texas AISLMJ" said McGee, “and I collid—
ed with another player pretty hard. I felt a crack which was

pretty audible, and almost immediately knew it was broken."

After spending three hours cradling his limp arm in a
nearby hospital, McGee’s arm was placed in a sling, but he
still managed to get in an appearance post-injury. During the
final points ofthe final match ofthc weekenndGeesporc
ing his tennis shoes and his sling, hung with his mark into
the :ndzone, lunged at the disc and missed a foot~block by
mere inches.

After the successful weekend, Grinnell Ultimate is look-
ing forward to “kicking-off" the rest or the spring season.
with additional planned trips to tournaments in Georgia and
Missouri.

EYJAI GARG

As show pelted the Grinnell landscape, a storm of a different nature was
hrcwrng inside the halls of Grinncll college. As some tuned in to watch the
popularly acclaimed Puppy Bowl, others waited in frigid anticipation for the
biggest event of the year: the Super Bowl From Younker to Cleveland yes,
Cleveland TVs were ablaze with images ofManning and Brady.

Instead ofhcing holed up inside ofBurhng, many students spent their son-
day night enjoying a feast offree pizza and pop while watching the superhowl
in lounges across Campus. Feb. 3 was no ordinary night; H was NY. vs. Boston,
it was Manning vs, Brady. instances of an oldrschool East Coast rivalry were
alive and rampant in the Forum lounge, with multiple cheers and jeeis often
accompanying every play

“The lounges weie packed,"said Jeffrey Sinick'09. “Pretty much every tele-
vision was tuned into the super Bowl.”

The SGA Films cornmirrcc along with ACE threw a Super Bowl party in
the Forum south Lounge, which had the game projected on the big screen.
The event gathered an unprecedented crowd, Seats were filled up and down the
aisles,from left to right people were sitting on the ground.“l think many people
were suiprised,"said Sinick, who is the SGA films chair, “The Super Bowl was
very popular on campus.”

Vited,1just showed up and to my surprise there were actually a lot ofpeople,"
said Malcolm Scott ’11.

Football prohahly went the only thing attracting people to the game this
year. The Super Bowl is the time of the year when our favorite multinational core
porntions roll out their top-notch commercials. With a 30rsecond commercial
going for $2.7 million. the audience wasn't disappointed, Certain memorable
commercials included the “Doritos Mouse" and the ROCkYTKliel‘nbd Clydesdale
Budweiser commercial.

For some people, it is more about the tradition of watching the pantheon of
spoiting events lather than the event itself “We spent more time talking about
vegan cheese than ahout the game," proclaimed Emily Iwuc '08, a Patriots fan.
in Cleveland Lounge, around 30 people had gathered to enjoy a host ofaltcrnar
tives to the typical snack food found during a Super Bowl game. Vegan cheese
