Preps Entertain
Quad Accompanied
By Paddle Chorus

To the tune oi many pounding pads
tiles and loud cries oi “Freshmen out”
the prep men last night had their ﬁrst
realitaste oi college paddles. As one
prep so eloquently put it in address
ing the ladies. “It was a very form—
alAaffitil', tor the ircshrnen were all in
evening clothes. and :undoubtedly the
sdies were in evening gowns,” l

Altogether the ireshmen reported
that they had a very warm reception
and while some oi them got slightly
out oi breath on the way to the quad.
nevertheless, they had sufficient liie
left to sing heartily and deliver some
orations worthy any high school
ireshrcan.

The party ended with a little re.
ceiving line which did it past to keep
the iresh iro ingetting homesick by
gently reminding them of their father
and thef’old wood shed.

But, after having looked over the
new arrivals, we oiier our heart ielt
sympathy to the sophomores, and

 

thank the powers that be that our
clztss scrap days are over!

There are to be two ne‘w instructors
in the School oi Music. Miss rim-y
