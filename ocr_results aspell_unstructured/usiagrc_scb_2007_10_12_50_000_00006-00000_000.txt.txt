Ratatouille
(2 007)

Mouse movie defies stereo—
types, amazes visually

Many critics praise computersnniinatcd
films by comparing them to slim comprrtcrr
uniniatcd films. But why can't we consider their
aitlsric ment in a context beyond the tecl‘r
nslogical plmvcss ot‘ Pixar? That being said,
I want to treat Rti/timn/It, Brad Bird’s latest
pixilatcd creation, as mor-c than thc laws! step
in an ougorilg experiment with computers.

To begin. let’s consider the characters.
The human hero is Linguiui (Lou Romano),
a nebbish, gawky and unthreatening clean-up
boy who works in rhc kitchen of a four-star
restaurant in the heart ofParis His love' inter
est, a chef named Colette( (Janeane Garofalo),

gasp. independent, neryand tough as
nal 5. Could his be the heavy-handed reversal
of gender roles that we need over years ofscxr
ist children’s movies?

But I do feel that the thematic content of
Ratatouille is detrimentally simplistic. Rar can
cook. Son of cook can’t. Pretentious critic has
an inner child (inst wait for Bird's masterful
revelation of this fact). Hmm maybe Bird
is trying to tell us that appearances can be der
ceiving, and that we shouldn’t be too quick to
judgel 1 would comment on this message, but
I'm afraid I need more time to wrap my head
around such a newfanglecl notionl

Lest I literally transform into the Grinch,
I want to brieﬂy pay Ram/mull! a compliment,
albeit an obvious one. The ﬁlm’s attention
to visual detail is illindrblowiligly satisfying.
With the delicacy ofa gourmet chef, Bird int
arses every scene with colors and movements
that delight the senses. We get to see Remy

jerky dance that ensues may not be as funny to
you as it is to eiglitryearrolds. But I bet your

The film ingeniously explores the tension
between our idiosyncratic tastes and tendons

from a competent kitchen, not morherly love,
but Bird doesn’t let the impersonal nature of
gourmet food color his message, He rightfully
points out that the joy we derive from food is
like any othei pleasllre, in that ultimately, it
stems from a desile [0 feel happy and secure,

The Single Sock and OtherAdventures

Last week, Beth confronted

Clyde at a local bar...

Cl de didn’t sa an hin ,but 'ust sat
tliere,yon his bar stblol, \irlth 1g wornlook in
his eyes. James the bar-render heard him
heave a deep, deep sigh that seemed to origr
incite somewhere down below his bentrup
work boots. Clyde seemed to be stealing
himself for whatever she had to say.

“The usual, Bcth,"Jaincs whispered.

“Thanks James, rhat would be great."

Clyde watched her as she prrt her may
senger bag up on the hat and rested her
head on the canvas. she wasn't so young

suggestions of Future wrinkles at the Corr
rlcrs or hcr blue eyes and the down turn or

But it was still hard for him to believe
that this little S-foot—nothi Female hatl

messed up his life so entirely He should
have cleaned out his trailer the day he met
her in Bernie‘s Bait Shop and his truck CXr
plodcd. But instead Clyde had denied his
superstitious side that believed in the axis
tence of signs, and had hung around Silver
Cliff, out ofhabit.

“thnd you get back?"

“About an hour ago."

They sat in silence for a bit drinking
their beers.

“I gotta go to the bathroom."

She hopped off her stool‘ but a button
on her barn coat snagged her messenger
bag and pulled ir down off the counter. She

yaped and tried to catch the bag blit it fell

Brave off-putting accent for

brilliant dark comedy

The Coen brothers’ F/I 0 would be the
perfect smart dark comedy t wasnt for that
over the top Minncsotan accent Not only
grating, it has been the bane of Minnesotans’
existence since the aim was released, scaring
away potential viewers like myself, But the
brothersv (T/Jc Big Ltt/Iartuxlvt', O Brat/m W/Jt'rc
Art T/Iill) superb script, Joel's strong directing
and standrout performances shine through
the difﬁcult accent.

The movie follows thc bungling of car
salesman Jerry Luildegaard (\Nilliam H,
Macy) as he attempts to case his financial
troubles. His plan: to hue two men, Gaear

alter (Steve Buscemi), to kidnap his wife, in
hopes that his fathcrrinrlaw will pay a lalge
sum otmorrcy to have her released. Along the
way, though, the kidnappers run into difficul-
ties with a state trooper, bloodshed ensuing.

Investigating thc resulting triple homicide
is seven months pregnant Marge Gunderson.
Played by Francis McDormand, who won an
Oscai fol her iole, Gundeison is an affable
tiooper who uses a genrle questioning manner
and shrewd intellect to quickly figure out the
perpetrators of the murder and, subsequently,
the kidnapping.

McDormand isn't the only actor that
shines. William H. Macy is fanttlstic in his
role of a bumbling car salcsman, and. as 31,
ways, Steve Buscemi is brilliant as tr criminul
that won‘t shut up.

Fargo, with its black humor, fascinating
characters and famous wood chipper scene, is
one of the best movies I have ever seen. Too
bad it took me almost to years to set it,
