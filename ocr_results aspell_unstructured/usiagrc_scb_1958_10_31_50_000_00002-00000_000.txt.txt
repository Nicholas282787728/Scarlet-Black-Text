Sticks

By Paul nass

As any freshman enrolled in
History B7B can tell you, one of
the fixtures of medieval feudal.
ism was a thing called a ‘lboon
day." A feudal baron required of

his peasants, his willains, a set
number 01 work days each year

. say. perhaps, four days of
every seven. But during plant-
ing and harvest times, the un-
derlings were held for extra
service, “boobs," and could sow
U!‘ reap their own acreage only
when that of the overlord was
safely under wraps.

Most freshmen will tell you,
further, that feudalism wither-
ed away sometime during the
15th or 16th centuries, and
that the concept of been days
no longer survives. And so
would I have agreed, bad i
not run into it just yesterday.
In the policies and collective

mind of the housekeeping de-
partment, you see, feudalism is
a living thing, a going concern.
The housekeeping employees are
not really serfs, of course; they
do receive some recompense for
their labors (something in the
realm of a dollar an hour, I be-
lieve; a handsome wage). ,Nor
are they bound to the soil; they
are free to seek work elsewhere
(presumably under equally be-
nevolent management). Their
condition is not entirely anal-
ogous to that of the manorial
peasant. Yet I contend that the
housekeeping workers, and ii
north campus maids in particu—
lar, are being held for boon
days.

The situation, brieﬂy, is this:
one maid is required to report
- to the campus at 7 am. each
Sunday morning, there to put
in four hours cleaning up the
nine hall loungesl That is all
there is to it: she must merely
get up at dawn, drive in from
Kellogg or Newton or wher-
ever she lives, and spend four
hours scraping up the butt»
ends and broken furniture of
a gay Saturday night.

What prompted the house-
keeping higherrups to such
measures is beyond me; I should
think the c of HP or the hall
councils could appoint weekly
cleanup crews (it being too‘.
much to ask the men to volun—
tarily put things in order). But
the policy exists, and it cries}
for correction. Seven o‘clock isl
an unholy hour, even on Sun-‘
day, and whether the ll maidsi
would choose to spend those‘
four hours in church or merely,
in bed hardly matters.
o’clock is bad enough . . . but‘
a policy that each week makes,
some underpaid woman face,
both rising sun and some sopho-1
more’s shambles is a little too
unjust to tolerate. 1

Furthermore, these same
maids, when their turn to
serve comes up, are sent home
four hours early one after—
noon; their four-hour stint on
Sunday morning does not add.
a cent of overtime to their
already paltry wages!

Whether this
service, truly constitutes a sur-
vival of feudalism I leave to my
peers to judge; it is possible
that I have been hasty, and that
my assertion is historically in.

valid. Still, injustice is injustice,

whether feudal or modern, and

a stop should be put to it. 1 am’

not going to volunteer to police
our lounge at seven o’clock next
Sunday monlng; l loathe the
gray dawn as much as the maids.
I will, however, try to see that
it is done, and properly, before
noon.

If this means blinding or be-
heading n few recalcitrant hall-
mules, well, just chalk it up to
feudal custom . . .

Si'uden'i Ar’r Enlivens Union; This—$200 raise . . .

Ari' Maiors

Origina’re Display '

By Staff Reporter

Dissatisfaction with the bare walls in the Union grill
and a desire to give students who are doing art work on
campus El. chance to exhibit, combined to give Susan Fraser
and Lucy Suffer, both art majors, the idea of hanging Stu-

dent Work in the Union.

This idea was conceived last
spring. The two talked to Edith
A. Sternleld (art) who assured
them that the plan had been dis—
cussed hefore but that nothing
had ever come of the idea. They
then talked to President Bowen,
who enthusiastically supported
them, and over the summer
mouldings were put up around
the grill walls.

This fall Lucy and Susan
approached anyone they knew
who was doing art work, and
received enough paintings to
hang the first exhibit. Because
they feel that there are others
on campus who have done
work suitable for hanging,
they have tried not to restrict
the exhibits to work of ma-
iors or work done as a class
assignment. All contributions
to the exhibit are to be volun»
tary.

So far the showings in the
Union have been of miscellan-
eous media and subject. Plans
are being made for integrated
exhibitions in the future: pos-

sibly there will be one of stu—

dent and faculty doodling. An-
other idea is a showing suggest»
ing simple art work which the
student might produce himself
for room decoration.

The first showing consisted of
oils by Karen Allen and Lucy,
gouaches by LoisHeld and Laur—
el Ellison and a casein by Mar»
tha Erlich. Now hanging are oils
by Karen and Irene Berlow, a
gouache by Lois, a water color
by Susan and a series of char--
coal drawings by Lucy.

Susan noted that there is
great stimulation in being
criticized and that the only
opportunity which has hereto—
fore existed for exhibition has
been at a showing during finals
in the spring. Obviously there
is little stimulation for mass
attendance at these showings
Also they consist entirely of
class work. “Ari,” said Lucy,
“should be a part of one’s
everyday experience.”

In order to allow more stu—
dents to get work hung, Susan
and Lucy plan to change the
exhibit approximately every
two weeks.

To the Editor:

Concerning victory Day which
was held on Monday, Oct. 27:
why did the Student Council
consider it unnecessary to in~
form the faculty of the feel that
classes were not to be given on
that date? Or did it just slip
their mind?

I consider this lack of cour—
tesy rather appalling, when
dealing with people who hold
responsible jobs and should un-
derstand the many facets of
such responsibilities.

. , . ln tuition and room costs when announced, after two
weeks of rumor, came as quite a blow to many members of the
student community. Threats of transferring, accelerating to get
through in three and a half years or of selling the family car to en-
dure the foreseen hardships are plentiful.

This is the normal aftermath of at shock and will probably
disyel itself after several weeks. Now, however, a Sentiment is
running that is dangerous and, if vestiges of it remain, it will be
of detriment to the college/[his sentiment is one of resentment
and misunderstanding directed at the administration and trustees.

It is our feeling that:

l. The administration and trustees have acted openly and hon-
estly in releasing thls announcement to the public. Obviously, no
announcement could be made until the trustees had met. As soon as
that meeting was over and announcements to parents were mailed,
the campus was informed of the action.

2. The trustees and the Committee on student Aid have re-
affirmed the policy that no student need leave Grinnell because of
financial dlfflcultlw, Certainly, We cannot all expect a $200 rise in
scholarship~that would defeat the purpose of the action. Grinnell’s
scholarships, the largest and most widely distributed in the Middle-
west, are based almost entirely upon need. If that need be shown,
we have no doubt that the student will be aided as much as pos-
sible. if no scholarship can he given, the new long-range loan sys-
tem will still be there.

3. This loan system has been objected to by students who go
back to the quite valid middle-class prejudice against installment
buying. Admittedly, it is not good to be in debt. It does, however,
seem slightly different tdbe in debt to a college than to a finance
bureau, students also hesitate to saddle themselves with debt for
the years immediately after they leave college. For people now at
Grinnell, any loans which must be taken will. however, not be of
sufficient size to merit this concern. If we could afford to come back
before the tuition raise, we can afford to come back having borrow-
ed tbe $200. This sum, stretched over several years, is not a colossal
burden.

Finally, the couege is not setting itself up as a ﬂmnoe organiza-
tion. Unlike Shylock, it will not exact the “pound of flesh” of com—
pound interest. Terms for the loans are the most beneficial possible
to the debtor. The college must, in self—protection. charge some in-
terest for it in turn must borrow the money and pay interest on it.

4, we feel that it is necessary and reasonable for the college to
enact thls tuition raise. We’ve looked at a lot of college fees and
and proposed fees in the past two days. We compare favorably with
all colleges_considered our peers. We are more reasonable than
some, lnflation is upon us, unfortunately, and it effects the mass
buying necessary to maintain the campus much as it effects daily
living expenses of our parents.

Educauonally we must pay for what we get. We came to Grin-
nell instead of to our state universities because we wanted some-
thing that could not be offered by mass production education.
Specifically, we were attracted by a small campus with academic
(this is to say faculty) excellence and a favorable studentrfacuity
ration. As larger numbers of students pour into the nation’s col-
leges, a larger number of faculty members is demanded. Unfortun-
ately, the production of professors is not in proportion to the cle-
mand and, as with every other scarce commodity, people must pay
more to get it.

From the student point of View:

We strongly urge that notiﬁcation (contingent, of course, on
second semester grades) b? given in students in the spring as to the
outcome of their scholarship requests for the next academic year. in
this way, people who find themselves in financial straits can ins
ltl'ate applications to other Schools then instead of waiting until
mid-summer,
