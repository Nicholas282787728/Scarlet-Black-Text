WISE MANAGEMENT?

As the time approaches for the appearance
of Miss Cornelia Otis Skinner it is becoming
increasingly apparent that there has been
mlslilanagenicnt and a seemingly flagrant (lis-
l‘egard of the rights of the student body.

At last the definite decision has been
reached to hold the pcrtorlucncc in the college
chapel and this seems to be the crowning
episode iii the whole affair. This decision has
been ordered ill spite of the fact that the chapel
has a seating capacity of 701 and that there is
an enrollment of 771 students. This means
that, excluding faculty members and town
people wllo might want to see the performance,
there will still be 70 students who will be
unable to take advantage of their semester fecs
and attend. Add to this, the fact that there
will be a large number of old grads back. who
will welcome the opportunity to see and hear
Miss Skinner. aild the situation becomes highly
ridiculous. Possibly they may have a few
seats hung from the coiling, but this does not
scclil to be feasible at the moment.

This is not the only complaint which can
be lodged against the. handling of the entire
affair. It is only logical to ask why was Miss
Skinner c\‘cr hooked to appear during Homer
coming? The students wllo are paying for
her appearance with their semester fcc money
—will not derive the benefit or enjoyment frolll
her appearance that. they would werc she to
appcar at some other time, The campus will be
crowded with old grads and in the sudden
renewal of old fl-icudslli ' and thc thousand
and one things which go to make up Home-
coming, the dramatic abilities of Miss Skinner
will be shoved aside without a true apprecia-
tion of their worth. This booking of such an
outstanding actress during:r Homecoming ccr-
taillly seems odd, to say the least.

And to top matters off, the performance
is to be given the sainc night as the Honor G
Homecoming dance. True, the (lance will not
start until 9 o’clock, nevertheless there will he
a great many students who will not walit to
attend the dramatic performance at 7 .30
o’clock and then dash to a dance which will
probably have been going on for half an
hour or better.

Especially is this true of those Students
uho have meal time jobs, It will be practir
cally impossible for students to complete their
work, dress for the dramaticperformancc and
the dance, and still get to the chapel by 7:80
o’clock. However, with no consideration for
the working students, the performance will
8 l: at 7 :30 o’clock. It will have to, if every-
thing is to be crowded into one evening as the
present plans call for. All error in judgmentl
\Ve leave that to you.

 

Those circunlsimmcs can hardly be attribu-
ted to accident and they certainly smack
strongly of mismanagement. lf more efficient
management and better judgment can not be
secured under the present sct up, then it is time
for a radical change. The students are paying
for the performers who appear on the lecture
course and thc lcast that students can
expect ‘ a square deal, brought about by u'iso
management and careful planning.

G
STUDY THE PLAN

\Villl tllc prcscntatioll of tllc Stndeul
Council’s plan for auditing alld systematizillg
student accounts, a definite approach has been
made to a problem which has long concerned
tllc campus and thc adluiuistratiml.

While it is not coullllou knowledge, yet a
great deal of difficulty has been encountered
ill the management of student organization
financial mailers. This has not al-iscn from
the lack of honesty on the part of tho holders
of the financial offices. but from the signing
of poor and often unreasonable contracts,
especially ill the case of publications. or the
llccdl over use of credit facilities, in the
case of other campus organizations.

This situation has rcsultcd ill increasing
reluctance on the part of the merchants, both
of (irillllcll and clsewhcrc, to grant credit to
collcgc organization. and has also reflccted to
the discredit of the school. Now at last a prac-
tical solution is being presented to the students.

Within a few days the matter of a central-
ized auditing bureau. as proposed by the
Stlldcnt Council, i 'll be under consideration.
Whether or not it is adopted depends largely
llpon the student body. The plan seems
drasti blit drastic measures are often neces-
sary to cure vicious practices.

However, each student should acquaint him-
self with the complete details of the plan before
making his decision either for or against the
proposal.

A solution is liccded. That lunch is appalu , '

cut. and it is only by adequate study of this
proposal or any othcrs which may follow, that
the best solution will be discovered. Study this
plan. then make your decision.

CREDIT WHERE IT IS DUE

Each spriug is heard the chronic complaint
that the Student Couucil is useless. It never
accomplish s anything and never will, Thcsc
misconceptions carry over to the following
ycar and thc cumulative effect of this kicking
has been to create the prevalent opinion that
the Student Council has not been, is not and
will not llc anything.

l\ lllolllcnt’s pause in survey the achieve-
ments of the current Council will ea _ prove
how wrong this assumption is. This year’s
Council has succccdcd ill accomplislllllmlt of
illl‘cc important things. First. it placed the
Scar of and Black on the college fees and ill
so doing rcduccd tllc price of a year ls subscrip-
tion from I€1.50 lo #050 Second, a complete
reoi‘galli' tlou of the semester fcc allotments
was made, last spring. and now the Council
is working out a lie w system for auditing
student accounts.

Certainly those tllrcc achievements can not
ho scolicd at. And it sccllls only fair to give
credit whcrc (3 edit is due. The present
Council has DEG“ war it}: hard ill all effort to
rrally bo of some assistance to tbc student
body, and the least that the studcnts can do
is ccasc to criti Sc until they have a legitimate
reason to do so. Give the Council nlcmbcrs
