Video made the Plastics

Feminist, one woman band performs tonight

Two of the first words describing
Tracy and The Phsri'cs on their webs
site are lesbian and feminist. Tliats
manageable. But add “video artist” to
that equation, and Ms. Tracy is tread-
ing dungetous ground rhat has already
been tread and tetread, often badly, in
years and decades past.

But those words fail to typify the
band. With a name like Tracy and
the Plastics, a Little something retro,
sexual and stmngc is bound to hap-
pen.Wynne Greenwood and her clear
tronic equipment will bring that style
to Gardner tonight.

But wait, where is Tracy? Where
are these infamous Plastics?

They all came along, transmit
ted straight through the wires to the

‘ speakers and the video screen. Green—
wood plays Tracy live and interacts
with onscreen, prerecorded band
mates, also play ed by Greenwood.
Nikki on keyboards and Cola on
drums at: projected behind Tracy."
The band’s songs sound sort of like
a one-woman, pte-p’op Le Tigre:
minoriey, electronically-inﬂuenced
tunes spoken/sung in a somewhat
sarcastic tone. Surprisingly, Tracy and
the Plastics soundjust as clcver,just as
excited and just as hardcore.

But Tracy’s about more than the
music. The two video-screen band
members rock out in the most appme
priate place to make subtle statements
about women—the domestic sphere!

ties 'o nail polish bottles and base

have taken their act everywhere from
the Whitney Biennial to Harvard to
queer discos, so fans of all of those
scenes might be in Gardner tonight.

Derholz, who opened for 3,2,1
Activate! last fall, have come back to
play another opening round.They get
compared to Devo in part for their
twitchy remakes of ’805 classics like
“Sussudio” and "Like 'Lt Virgin," but
they also shine in theii intense origi-
nuls: songs like “I,M.A. Believer" and
"Behold the Man," which lampoon
their evangelical Christian upbring-
ing and revel in their rock-and-roll
lifestyle.

Very obscure indie groups need to
bank on their ability to be compared
to other indie groups to get a crowd,
so throwing out names like Lc Tit
gre rtnd Devo might garner a crowd.
Friday’s bands will bring something
markedly less marketable, but the full
set may deliver something equally, if
not more, inventive.
