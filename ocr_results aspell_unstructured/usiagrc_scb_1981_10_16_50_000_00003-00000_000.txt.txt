However dated, this movie is a classic
western which still provides a lot of enters
tainment. It uses all the standard tricks,
plus the sure-tire device of putting an
assorted group of people together in a
dangerous situation. The hero, John
Wayne, overcomes all odds to see the
stagecoach through. it's a nice tilm, pro~
vided you‘re getting to see the original and
not the shoddy remake.

The Second film, Cactus Flower, is a
disappointing adaptation of the Broadway
comedy by Abe Burrows, Sure Goldie
Hawn is cute enough and she even won an
Academy Award, but she Still doesn‘t save
this movie. ingrid Bergman looks uncom-
fortable most of the time, in this role which
she is just too mature to play. All in an;
more spark and less stilted dialogue would
help this movie.

Finally, a movie with a deceiving title.
No, this is not the Marx Brothers' comedy
classic but rather a zany comedy starring

Cary Grant as a scientist who invents a re-
juvenation tonic, when he experiments
with it, he iinds he's in tor some hilarious
results. Marilyn Monroe has a small bit in
this agreeable little movie,

Pioneers against his alma mater, Coe Col
lege, in a Midwest Conference encounter
at Rosenhloom Field. Kickoti time is 1:30
pm. and admission is tree to all comers.

The Pioneers, 173 for the campaign, had
an open date last weekend and Dom~
browski welcomed the break as it gave ex-
tra healing time to several injured per»
tormers it also gave him time to concen-
trate on a sputtering oitense that produced
only one touchdown in the last three
outings. Getting the pioneers up should be
no problem tor Dombrowksi as he and the
Grinneu veterans vividly remember a 697
thrashing they received last year at Coe‘s
Homecoming. "This is a typical Coe team
7 talented, experienced, and big," said
Dombrowski.

Coe opened the campaign with three vic-
tories but has dropped its last two contests
