The C of HP has made its stand and recommendation,
on prepping. Now it is up to the presidents who will be‘
elected ill the spring. |

What comes from tile llew C of HP concerning prep—l
ping will be interesting for two reasolls. ;

First, the C of HP elected next spring will be chosen
from the class of 1961, tlle first class to be subjected to a
n idified prepping program in several year As such, the
lien C of HP will have as background a prepping program,
which has declined in severity tllree years in a row. i

ll" the new council allows tllis backg ound to inﬂuence
its formulation of a prepping program, it will probably take.
the recommendation of the present C of HP and begin all

it could decide because of

s of tile prepping proﬂrams \\ ich the members

I: re seen that a much “tougher” proglam would be ad-
v lltag‘eousl However. consider'lg the pressure from both
students and the administration, the puss. ility of this
second course of action is slight. ‘

Second the new program will be of interest, because
if the C of HP does follow the recommendation made by
Rallisrlell's council and put more emphasis on “both the IM
and social programs of the individual halls and the intel»
lat ll and culturrl aspects of the college as a whole” it,

)1 initiate a progr m of orientation which will require
ino'le work, couperat on and assumption of responsibility
on, the part of not just the house councils but of all upper-

smen. ,

Thus, regardless of the efforts lnade by the new C of
. ’, the whole success of the program will rest with tlle
members of each hall. Unless they are willing to assume
this responsibility, the type of program under consider-2b
ii :11 will fail to a greater degree than the programs of past
. al . In fact, it can be assumed thel will be more rough
spots, di. 'ourasfement and frustra on (luring the firstf
year or two of such a program than there ever has been
under the old r tem. ‘

For this ome insurance that the new program,
i adopted, \ ll be given a fair chance to prove itself, is a
duhnite necessity. l

Since it would be all too easy for student pressure to
fibre a C of HP of the future to overthrow any policy
adopted by the C of UP next spring, it has been recom-
mended that the new program, if acceptable to the faculty
and administration, be incorporated into the rules of the
college.

Here, screams of “student rights" and ”administra-
tion can. irship" are heard ill protest to such a suggestion.
“i; would be the last to Favor concession of such rights.

Therefore we suggest a stipulation on any such dev,
c :toll coming from the administration; that after a prede—
t l'lniued number of year . the final decision as to whetheri
o. lint to retain a new or entation program must be made
by the students.

Considerinn‘ the fact that such a program would prob-
ably provc itself. “e are confident that the facility and ad»
n. , stration would agree to such a stipulation.

We have recommended that the administration take
action only because we feel that the law of the C of HP
could not be made to stick. If. somehow, the “trial period“
l-iiil be made a concrete part of tile student law. then we
in: (1 no assistance from the ildlnini ration or faculty.
Otherwise wc see no other possible cour c of action.

; To the Editor:

‘ in the general praise for the
.rooently concluded Gales loc-
we are concerned that
.‘Dnc of the chiei components of
ltheir success not be overlooked.
yiAupi-ooiatioo has been express—
ed, oltell and lavishly, for the
qualities which Professor Paul
,Weiss brought to this series.
,Tho appreciatlon is proper. and
:we concur.

Cu rcs,

But the week was essentially
‘a continuing discussion between
Frolessor Weiss and the Grinnoll
student body. A successful dis-
:cussion requires able discuss~
,ants And never have we felt
,grealcl‘ pride in Grinncll stu-

. their questioning was
aeule: their comments were ape
propriate; their ability to fol»
low an extended argument was
gratifying.

, We extend our congratulations
lto the Grinnell students, who
Elprovided the Continuous chal—
ilenge which allowed our guest

{to respond so admirably,
