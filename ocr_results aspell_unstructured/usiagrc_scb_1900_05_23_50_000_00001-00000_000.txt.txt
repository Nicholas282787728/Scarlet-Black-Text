The New Catalogue.

This year's catalogue was made
ready for distribution last week. in
matters of contents, size, and general
style of make-up, it resembles very
closely last year's publication. There
are some changes in the order of par-
agraphs, and a few verbal alterations.
A more detailed description of the
equipment of the library and a fuller
explanation of the workings of the
group system are two of the more no-
ticeable changes. The Chronicle of
Events, giving a list with dates of the
most ‘important collegiate events of
the past year, appears as a new fea-
ture.

The corrrses of study announced
for next year are in most of the de~
partments quite similar to ones previ-
ously given, though a tew changes are
indicated. Dr. Herron'sdeparture has
made necessary a partial re-organiza-
tion of the Department of Applied
Christianity. Prof. Wyckoff will con-

 

duct classes in sociology throughout
the year instead of during a half year
only, as previously, and he is able to
expand his courses correspondingly.

Prof. Nollcn’s temporary absence
for next year seems to have caused
some changes in the Modern Language
work for the time. Among the new
courses otter-ed is one in scientiﬁc Ger-
rrran, which is given in response to a
demand from students in the science
departments.

Prof. Davis offers two theoretical
courses—a course in “Personal Hy-
giene and Sanitation,” and one open
toaliruited number, designed espe-
cially for teachers, in “Gymnastic
Theory and Practice." For the sec~
and course, college credit will not be
given,

A two-hour elective in “Prose Fic-
tion (British and American) of the
Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries,"
conducted by Professors eritcornb
and Noble, and new post major work
in Prof. Johnson's history, are also
among the new courses announced.

The summary of attendance for the
year shows a total of 468 students, as
against 479 for the previous year.
The attendance of the collegiate de-
partment, however, was never so
large as now, the enrollment for the
year being 290, as against 270 for
last year and 280 for 1897-98, the
next largest previous total. An ex-
amination of attendance records for
the last ten years reveals not only an
increase in the collegiate attendance,
but it discloses the fact that the in»
crease is entirely from among the
women. The average yearly attend-
ance, in the collegiate department, for
the ﬁrst half of the last decade (from
1890-91 to 1894-95) was 235 3-5, of
which number 14S 25 were rrren and
90 1-5 were women. The average
attendance for the second half was
263 3-5, of which number 144 were
men and 119 35 women, showing a
small decrease in the attendance of
the men, and a substantial increase in
the attendance of the women. The
per cent of men for the ﬁrst half der
cade was 61.7 as against 54.7 for the
second half. in the academy is a sim-
ilar state of aﬁairs. The average for
the ﬁrst trait decade was 159 3—5, of
which number 56 4-5 percent were
men, while in the second halt there
was an average attendance of 162 sure
dents, of wlronr 51 475 per cent were
men. Moreover, at no time during
the last ten years, have there been so

 

ferv men in attendance at the college
as there are now, the total for college
and academy being but 215, which is
17 less than the average for the last

ten years.

Chrestomathian.

Tire Clu‘estomalhian program, Sat-
urday evening, consisted of an extern-
poraneous contest, open to all juniors
and seniors in the society, held for the
purpose of choosing the society's rep»
resentative in the Hill contest. About
three hours’ preparation was possible,
the subjects being assigned at ﬁve
o’clock, and each contestant was ale
lorved ten minutes on the tloor. The
contest was 01 a very high order and
aliorded one of the best programs of
the term. Vicerpresident Arnold pre-
sided.

The ﬁrst number- was a vocal solo
by Miss Clarke, the “Norse Lullaby,"
by Carpenter.

Mr. Wylie, with the subject of
“Charles Sheldon and his Views," was
the ﬁrst speaker. By way of intro
duction he gave a concise sketch of
Sheldon’s earlier life, and then de-
scribed his methods of work and his
growing successes. Sheldon stands
today “a typical rrran of the century”
—a man of the people. Hamlin tol-
lowed with a discussion of “The Clark
Case.” Mr. Hanrlin reviewed the ac»
tion of congress in regard to Senators
Quay and Roberts, and prophesied a
just settlement ot the new questions
involved in the Clark case.

Mr. McCarty’s subject was “The
Trusts.” He pointed out the good and
the evils the trust may bring, and dis-
cussed the proposed solutidn of the
trust problem. Quaife was given the
”Problem of Rapid Transit. ” His dis-
cussion was broad and general, show-
ing the evolution of the various transit
systems and the logical solution of the
street-car problem through municipal
ownership.

Mr. Brande favored the society with
a vocal solo, Hawley's “Bedouin Love
Song." This was followed by Renza’s
“May Morning" as an encore nume
ber.

Mr, Parker, speaker on the “Presr
ent Political Outlook," predicted a
close contest between the two parties
in the coming campaign, and indicated
the possibility ot a democratic victory
as a result of the administration’s pol-
icy in the east and our attitude toward
the Boers. Meade’s subject was,

“Struggle as an Element in Life."
