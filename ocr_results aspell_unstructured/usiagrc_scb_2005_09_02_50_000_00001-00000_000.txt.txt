New students enter
Grinnell with a bang

A party break-up and a hospitalization
mark the opening weeks of first year

student experience
BY SARA MIRK AND BRIAN PERBRIX

Last Tuesday night, the Grinnell police department had a rodent
problem, of sorts,

The police received a noise complaint for the annual off-campus
party known as ‘Gerbilfest.’ Held in a house on High Street, the
party is a beginning ofthe school year triidiiion in which upperciasst
men welcome the ﬁrsttyeais, or “gerbils," to Grinnell.

According to party hosts Joe Reth ’07, Sean Flynt‘o7, and Doug
Ticus ’07, a police on arrived at the house around ii p.m,Tlie ot-
ﬁcers asked itthere was any underage drinking, and whether any of
the particrs were planning to drive drunk back to campus.

Reth said he was “unaware if anyone was underage and that
everyone was a student at Grinnell, so they would All be walking
home.”Ovei-ull, he felt that the police were “polite and understands
in .
gAfl’cr the initial questioning, the police continued to drive up
and down the block, stopping by the house twic'e more in response
to another noise complaint. When the hosts were told that they
would be issued a writeup if another complaint was received, the
party ended.

Campus ofﬁcials had no comment regarding the incident since
it occurred off campus and outside of itsjurisdiction. Because there
were no serious infractions reported, the police department did not
notify the college.

The encounter at Gerbilfest comes on the heels of what many
on campus felt was an especially rowdy New student Orientation.
Grinnell police chief Jody Mathtrly said that complaints regard
ing alcohol in the streets and boisterous behaVior have been "a little
more frequent than in past years.”

Student services conﬁrmed a case ofalcohol poisoning involv-
ing a ﬁrstsyear student that resulted in hospitalization. The student
reportedly ingested alcohol from multiple sources in a nontparty
settin .

Ingan average year, Grinnell reports seven to 10 cases of alcohol
poisoning. Federal law ohliges the college to respond with loosely
deﬁned penal measures.

According to Sheree Andrews, assistant dean of Student Affairs,
Grinnell's policy regarding alcohol emphasizes treatment rather
than judicial recourse. It is not known whether charges will be filed
in relation to the alcohol poisoning.

Construction, effects continue

Bv REBECCA TAYLOR

Students returned to an unfamiliar
campus last week. over their summer
break, construction had continued on
the Joe Rosenfield ’25 Campus Center
and had begun on Phase II of Noyce
Science Center.

Industrial machines, trailers, and
trucks have found a home on formerly
grassy fields.

The college is constructing the ads
jaccnt projects simultaneously. Over
the summer the campus center’s exte-
rior walls were erected, while part of
Noyce was demolished.

development and the added Construv
tion has attracted some student critir
cism. The gravelly area next to Noyce
serves as a staging ground for the con-

struction work, and the trailers between
Noyce and ARH are used as tool sheds
and offices. The fenced-off area forces
North Campus students heading to
Noyce to take a route along the west
side ofARH.

While acknowledging inconvet
niences, Ryan Lyerla ’03 said that “all in
all, it really doesn’t bother me because
in a couple years we‘ll be able to take
advantage of the facilities."

“We are right on track," said Marci
Sorter, director of Institutional Plant
ning, adding that the college arranged
the construction so the most disruptive
steps would occur over the summer.

According to the college website,
the Campus Center will be completed
next summer. Sorter said that the din»
ing staff need to be trained for the new

dining hall and that it may take some
time to officially move in.

Phase II ofthc Noyce Science Cen-
ter construction began in late July. The
one-story section on the north side of
the building has been demolished. A
threatsrory facility will emerge in its
place and should be ﬁnished in the
summer of 2007.

Vice President of Baker Electric
John Layiand said he loves working in
Grinnell and that the administration
and students are “very downsto-earth."

The Athletic and Fitness Center,
under work during much oflast year, is
completed and open to students. The
upper ﬂoor has 26 pieces of cardio
equipment and a stretching mat. The
lower ﬂoor is dedicated to strength
training.

Network changes boost security, but crimp file sharing

By DAVID DRISCOLL AND

JONAS PARK .

Vthn students returned to cams
pus and set up their computers this
year, they found a signiﬁcantly changed
Residential Network.

In past yeais, ResNet consisted of
a single united network throughout all
of campus and the offrczimpus houses,
This past summer, however, ITS m,
vidcd ResNet into twelve smaller nets
works, organized around dorms.

The new conﬁguration is more
sophisticated than the old one, which
was not advanced enough to handle
problems, according to Evan Case ’06,
Helpdcsk Technology Consultant Co-
ordinator. Now more tasks can he an-
tomated while network monitoring has
improved.

For example, in case ofa virus, ITS
can quarantine mlnlﬂlel’wol’ks or “1’
dividual compiitcrs much faster than
before.

The new system is based around a

new set of switches installed in each
dorm and the Clean Access software,
along with the smaller Local Area Nets
works (LANs) on campus, Students

which certain network
activities, including iTuncs and simply

each computer can only automatically

According to network manager-
Dave Ellis, this bioutleast traffic was
causing a traffic jam, and was the rea-
son for the change. “The network had
grown to the point that that broadcast

prevent those delays. the network was
divided up. Filetsharing had nothing to
do with this."

Last year, Case continued, ITS ivo-
quired students to bring their comput-
ers to [TS to have antitvirus software
installed. This was more successful but
very resourcetintcnsivc. The new up
proncli essentially automates last year’s
successful Operimon.

Avrain Lyon ’06, a former UC, bet

lieves the segmentation of the network
has broader implications than limiting
iTunes song sharing.

“People are able to do less. A lot of
interesting things are coming out that
use pecittotpeer negotiating."

ITS stands by its decision, howcvcr.
Ellis said the new system “does not
change the functionality ofthe network
we support. it was our effort to guarr
antee that there no network outages or
delays {or applications that are critical
to the function ofthe network."

Lyon disagreed with the decision
not to announce the changes. “If thc
way things work changes,"lte said, “that
needs to be made clear, and ifaddresses
change, that needs to be made clear.
and that hasn't happened,”

Nevertheless, both Case and Lyon
agree that the new system is better,
hoth trom ITS and rhc students' per—
spectives. "From a technical perspec-
tive,” Lyon said, the changes are “a vast
improvement."
