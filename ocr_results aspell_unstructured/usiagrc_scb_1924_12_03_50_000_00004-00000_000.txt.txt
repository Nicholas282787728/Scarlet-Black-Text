“Einstein and H-s Precursors" was
the title or the address which Dr.
George D. ni khoii, l-larvoi-tl Exchange
professor ,delivered at chapel Monday
in his ﬁrst appearance beiore a Grin-
nell audience.

Dr. Birkhofi laid a historical foun—
dation tor the explanation or the the—
cry of relativity which he will give in
chapel addresses, this week and next.
Euclid, Newton and Faraday were tak—
en up in turn as the precursors ct
Einstein. He stated that the relativ—
istic theory as published by Einstein
holds groundless the old concepts of
absolute time and space for the reas—
on that everything is measured by or
considered relative to something else.

“Space and Time" will be the title of
Dr. nirhhoft's lecture at the long chap.
el service Thursday. He stated Mon-
day that his second lecture would be
a continuance of the explanation of
the Theory of Relativity with less his-
torical treatment 01' the theory.

A wellnlled chapel iistened attens
tively to the ﬁrst of the exchange lec—
tures and was astounded at Dr. Birk-
hair’s ability to present a diificuit sub-
ject in a manner that could be easily
understood by the unscientiﬁc mind.

few members of the university raculty
seem to have the idea that a vacation
is not legal unless preceded by two or
three days of hectic quizzing.

protessors and instructors who eith.

dents thrn the "third degree” in the
ﬁnal hours, are not any too numerous,

Dollyle Cut System

Many or the students had intended
cutting a class or so in order that they
might reach home a few hours earlier,
One cannot cut such capers without
paying the price—double euts tor each
class. That'oenalty ought to be sui~
ﬁnisnt.

If an instructor has to hold a quiz
as 1 sort of axe over his students'

head to keep them in the class room.i
then corporal punishment ought to be:

justiﬁable in college, ,

Certainly an instructor has a ight
to give a quiz when he pleases and just
as often. students, however, are tun-
ny beings. It is regrettable that they
cannot concentrate and study as e!»
ﬁciently the day befole they are mak-
ing preparation to go home on a vaca-
tion as any other time of the year, but
it is 21 fact. Hardly one student out of
ten, with a vacation just about to start.
can do justice to himself in the class
room.

Poor Psychology

Psychologists loudly Vocifernte
about the necessity of one being in a
normal frame of mind when taking a.
mental test in order to really make a.
representative showing. Unless this
theory is a sackful of bunk, this idea
of throwing eleventh hour quizzes
doesn't even have a whole lot of logic.
much less common sense, brick. of it.

Quizzes are unpleasant enough at
any time. They must come, but at
least a little discretion would not go
amiss in their distribution.
