Miss Ada Mason.

The opening oration was in
epitome a plca for strong. nobles
minded citizenship. The thought
was clearly sct forth. but
marred by many trite toms of
expression. The speaker 210
credited himself well before the
audience and promises much tor
future contests if he receives
proper training.

The second speaker put all the
ﬁery enthusiam ot his earnest
nature into his delivery. He
spoke from personal knowledge
of the effects of Islam on the hu»
man race and perhaps/m what he
said more than any other on the
program. He made a strong bid
fol ﬁrst place The latter part of
his oration con'cerned the treats
ment oi the Armenian race by the
Ottoman empire, closing in these
words:

“In the seventh century a slum-
bering Christianity gave to Mos
hammed a talsc impression or its
principles which lcd him to round
an imperlect religion which co
suered where the greatcr bles
ings of genuine Christianity might

lose her opportunity? Let us.
the Christian nations otthc world,
our wrangling. right the
wrong we have done onc another,
and arise to deliver Armenia and
provetothc Mohammedan oppres-
sor the beneﬁcent power ofChr.
tian government and Christian

civilization." .
Miss Emily Peck represented

the sophomore class. Her oration
was a thoughtful rcsume' of the
treatment of woman in the novel.
Among the principal heroines
mentioned were Clarissa Harlowe,
jane Austen’s Emma, Balzac's
Eugenie. George Eliot's Romola,
Dorothea, Gwendolin and Dinah.
Otthehcroinesinthe early novels.
Miss Peck says: "Intellectually
they nevermatured. Designed to-
appear pcrtect at the beginning.
no progress, no interior develop
ment was possible. With no
faults to expratc, no necessity of
cultivating already full-grown
virtues, those heroines remained
inevitably, types of immovable
absurdity. Imagine Evelina or
Ollvia originating anything origi-
nal from the depths of their own
nature. or evolving anything from
the mutual action ofrnind or sym-
pathy; men wanted them to love
blindly in every condition or air
Cumstance.” In the modern novel
rnnch has been gained by a faith-
tul adherence to development of
character. notably in Mrs. Hume
phrey Ward's works The heroine
develops as the true woman
grows. The novel is not yet pers
feet. The oration closed with an
appeal to American women to set

up a tr'rle ideal of womanhood.
The last two orations were do

llvered by members of the senior
class. “Ethics and Patriotism”
was a strong appeal for patriotism
“built on principles or Ethics.”
“Educate for a\vorld»citizenship."
Mr. Williams said in part: “There
is no reason why we should not
love our country, There is no
reason why we should not demon
strate that love in the wildest ens
But there is reason
why we should count these United
Statcslhc best nation on earth.
Docs not the spirit of the ages
say to us: “To you 1 have given
a noble land where to build a nas
