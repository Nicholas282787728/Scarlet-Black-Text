Parenthood's Comic
Family Problems

By Jason Eckert

Countless movies have been
written on the relationships that
occur between parents and their
children. it is a subject that seems
to always appeal to not only the
adult factions of soClely. but to the
)OutJ’I as well. In this long line of
movies. few have ever been able to
combine not only humor, but serlr
ousness as well. That is. until now.
Parenthood is the first of lLs kind.

Parenthood combines the ten-
derness and warmth from movies
such as Dad and Terms cfErtdear-
mcnzwith thctypical humorassoci-
ntcd Willi Steve Martin films. This
melodrama focuseson the relnuonr
ships between generations. Jason
Robards plays the aging grandfa-
ther trying to keep everyone happy
by lookingoutforhis sons. Martin
plays the fathertrying togetthrough
his midlife crisis. stemming from
problems at work and insecurity at
home. Rick Moranis does an excel-
lentjob as the anal retentive fatllcr
who is Sieve Martin's brother-in-
law.

The best part of this movie is
its incredible script. The plot line
is well coneructod and is lmPlC‘
merited perfectly by Ron Howard.
As far as directors go Howard has
time and time again proyen his
talents: this movie is no exception,
The actors also turn in remarkable
performances. This has to be
Martin’s bestmovie. The support-
ing actors also do incredibly
well, All around. this is probubly
one of the best acted movies of the
decade.

strong ties between its members. it
focuses on this by showing the
problems of relationships between
children and thcir parents Lhat were
not maintained well when they were
younger. As a result. throughout
the film they are mended to help
deal with the pain of family
problems. This movie is an enters

students are currently missing
home, maybe this movie will put
parental relationships in perspec-
tive for them.

Kubrick's Full Metal
Vietnam Nightmare

By Jason Eckerl

In the long line of Vietnam
movies that originated with
Apocalypse Now and culminated
recently with Born on the mehof
July, one movie was hidden away
from all the academy awards and
the box ofﬁce. Stanley kubrick,
one of die most esteemed directors
in thebusiness.probablydidn’thave
this inmind; yetit was notentircly
unjust.

Full Metalluckel can be broken
down into two parts: “the boot
camp“ phase and later the “in
combat” phase.

The first part of this movie is
downrrightllyslericfll. It probably
contains one of the funniest se-
quences ever of a drill sergeant
reaming out his troops. This phase
of the movie is far superior to most
of the other Vietnam-type movies,
dueto the factihatmostofthe other
movies skip the training aspect.
and concentrate directly on thcwar
itself.

IfStanleyKubrick,whcndirect
ing it. could have kept tltis same
line of plot action and mood. thc
moviewouldhavebccnmorehighly
acclaimed. But the film then
changes abruptly to a serious side
as our characters go off to war.

This second aspect of the movie
is not poorly done, but it doesn't
comparetosuchsequcnccsin filttls

such as Platoon and Apocalypse
Now. The aforementioned movies
specializedvin trying to give the
viewer a sense of what actually
happened in Vietnam and the
grievous situation that transpired.

Full Metal Jacket tries to no
complish this, but tends to msh
through it, and HS characters are
not as sympathetic as those in
other Vietnam movies of the time
period, The movie does in fact
become very disturbing and makes
people really question themselves.

Full Metal Jacket takes the
viewer on an emotional roller
coaster through one of the most
dismal periods in our country’s
history. Those who enjoylaughing
oneminuteand crying thenextwtlt
really like this movie. Though the
film does leave a little bit to be
desired at the end, this is greatly
overshadowed by its incredible
beginning. Everyone who has seen
some of the other Vietnam movies
should see this one as well. for it
definitely gives the viewer a dif-
ferent feeling oi the war from the
characters' perspective than its
predecessors.

M.P.A.A. Establishes Flexible
Movie Rating System this Fall

By Chris Snyder

The Motion Picture Associa-
tion of America (M.P,A.A,) re-
cently announced therevamping of
their adult-end ratings system. re-
nammg one rating and adding new
features to another. The“X" rating.

wasreplaced byan“NC-l7"rating,
and new “R"-mtcd features Will
carry an explanation of why the
film was rated that way.

The policy change was long-
awaited by many people in the
motion picture industry because it
will make serious, adultroriented
films easier to produce and market.
Creating the “NC-l7“ rating meant
more than just changing the name
of the old “X”. even though “NC-
17" (no children under 17) Carries
exactly the same restrictions.

Most films that carried the “X"
rating were never actually rated by
the M.PrAA. When the ratings

under 17 without adult accompanir
merit) wereallcopyrighted,but“X"
was already widely usedand generic
for adult films. Thus, even though
mostpomographic material is never
submitted for rating, it can still be
called “X-mted material.“
“NC-l7” is copyrighted. how-
ever, and only films that are actUr
ally rated by the M.P.A.A. will be
able to carry this rating. These
kinds of features are traditionally
more respectable “art" films and
movies with graphic violence that
were previously unrated or edited

to garner an “R“ rating.

Thefeeling isthatcommercinl
theaters are more willing to show
“NC-l7” films asopposed to even
officially “X"ratcdworks. Another
goal of the new rating system is
to reduce the number of movies
that are just barely tame enough
to receive an ”R" raLing by allow-
ing producers to make films that
will be shown exclusively to
adults. yet still obtain general re-
lease.

The new ratings system should
take effect within several
months. '
