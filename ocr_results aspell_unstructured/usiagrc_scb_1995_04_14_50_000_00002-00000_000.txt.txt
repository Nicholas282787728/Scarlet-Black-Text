you, You’re a city person.

you like bright lights and the
threat of imminent mugging, plus
gallery openings, bigrnamerockcon-
certs, night clubs and a constantly
self-renewing pool of new people to
meet. But hey, at least you're only
stuck here in the corn for six weeks to
three years more, and you’re at the
college so that keeps things semi-
interesting And after you get your
degree, you're out of here,

Or maybe not. Surprisingly, a
large number of Grinnell alumni and
former students have stayed in Grin~
ncll, either by choice or because they
iust randomly ended up here, they
said. But what keeps them? Some
have stayed, they said, because their
interdisciplinary, liberal arts educa-

tion hasn't gotten them any goodjob
offers and there doesn‘t seem to be
anything else to do. Others have
started their own businesses or so»
cured jobs in the town or with the
college. And most cite a preference
for the small town way oflil'e where
everybody knows each other so iliat
“hipness” isirr a major concern.

chk is important to increase the
visibility of gay, lesbian and bi-
sexual students on campus.

“We start to take our accep-
tance for granted and blend in
with everyone else,” said senior
John Wanniger. “I think we’ve
been getting too comfortable--
we need to publicly take pride in
who we are.”

“We want queer people to

to stand together in solidarity and
openness," said sophomore Alice
