Sweatshops played no part in the decision to Join the
FLA, and this is one ofthe reasons that it is so intent
on getting the college to switch its membership.

The ﬁght for Grinnell to switch its membership
has been ongoing since SAS first formed on campus

A look at EAG

Allison Dolan

The environmental Action Group, EAG. has reorganized to draw a larger
group ofstiidents and focus its goals. Last year, EAG coordinatorTor Janson
said tlte group was compromised ofabout a halfdozen regulars, but this year
draws at least nventy to the weekly meetings.

To better focus the group, EAG divided into 5 subgroups to hone indi-
vidual goals » Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), Prairie, Master Plan,
Publications, and Green campus, Bath subgroup has a different meeting
time and one can be involved in as many different aspects ofEAG as one
wishes.

Bemuse EAG expects and draws a core group of twenty members plus
others who are involved more sporadically, the group can divide to effectively
conquer a broad range of concerns. “We believe in approaching seemingly
insurmountable global problems (global warming, habitat fragmentation) by
working ror positive chmg: in ourselves, our community, and our region,"
ianson said.

For example, the CSA program has volunteered at {arms with local pro
ducers to learn about rarming, and, more speciﬁcally organic farming.

Mcnnwlnlc, the Prairie sect organized two trips to nearby prairies to work
to restore the tallgrass prairie. The group bought work tools last spring to use
in restoration.

The Master Plan group strives to “establish Grinnell as a national leader in
green design. sustainable energy use, and native landscaping." according to.
Jansen.

The Publications group started an e-zine and writes the Restroom Realist
posted in bathrooms around campus.

Finally. the Green campus group works on improving campus recycling
and studying to minimize resource consumption. students are encouraged to
find a cause they (are about rind get involved

Jansen sttesses the establishment and maintenance oftelntionships. EAG

is workingtvith the new found population influx to address a variety ofenvie

ronmenral concerns. For more iiirormauon, email ergogvirre/iedii.
