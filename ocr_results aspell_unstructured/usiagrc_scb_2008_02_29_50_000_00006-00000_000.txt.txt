iivM/tTT Zhiunkil

Bursting the bubble of selﬂgovcrilancc, an
incident involving unauthouzed entry into a
professor's office has raised questions about
the nature and procedure of punishments at
Grinnell.

Two sccondeyeai- students were caught in-
toxicarcd iii the office or]. Pablo Silva, I-lisrory,
ar around 10:30 pm on Nov. 9 oflast year. Tire
students,who declined an interview, were subscr
quently asked to leave their campus housing this
semester and not enter campus except for “CC,
essary rities. Tile case was heard by Judicial
Council (JiidCo). a student factrﬁnding corntnittcc,

Judcri gave .i recommendation for discipline, bur the final
decision to remove the students from campus ivas madc by
Tom Cindy, tllcn Vice Picsidcnt of Student Affaiis and cvcnr
tuaily amended by President Russell K. Osgood.

Friends and advocates for the two students \veie critical of
this declsioilrillaklilg process in assigning the punishment. Phil
Hagen '10 and James Mciilert Y10, former roommates of the
two students, were worried about the timing of Crady's decir
sion, which they said
came on the last day
ofrhcscmcstcr.“Thcy
went and met with
[Grinncll Prcsidcnr
Russell 1<. Osgood]
that day because they
had to have an emer—
gency meeting before
the school closed,"
said Meutert. "[Onc
ofthcm] still had a ﬁnal to like "

Hagen said he tvas surprised at thc severity ofrhc pun he
mcnt. He said that from initial conversations with administra-
tioil aild formchudCo members, tlle two students believed they
would iccclvc a much more lenient punishment We talked to
people who were on JudCo before and rhcysiid youre not go~
ing to get anything above community service, ”he said.

Meinert thought that the punishment was inappropriate

”/ don’t think you enforce the idea

thotyoo should be more roped-

fo/ to your community by eX/hng a

potion from their community,”
James Meinert’l 0

and not an trfccrivc prerrcnra
tivc or educational measure.
“1 dont think you enforce the
idea that you should be more
respectful to your community,"
Mcincrt said,“by cxihng n pct»

Nco Moritkc '09, the stile
dciits’ SA, said she was ncircr
notiﬁed that the two would be
lowing campus. “I don‘t nccesr
sarily have to be told the cue
curnstiuices, but I feel that it
would he hcttcr for them to communicate that ‘oh, 5 in nc's
moving offyour fioor,"'shc said. "At this point, I d 'r feel that
my role as in SA is really that important, because if comillti~
nication between the school and I falls apart and I don't kllow
what’s happening on my tloorwvhy should 1 even bother?"

Atinnnls atlon could not comment on any specifics regards
mg their case.

\Nhilc resolved for now. the modem brings to light the fact
that students do get punished fairly regularly for misbehavior
at Council and that the p ccss for deciding punishments is
lligcly unknown and at timcs convoluted.

diews, associate dean and diicctor of student life, slid that
depending on rhc severity of the case, the decision for pun-
ishmeurs can either go to Judicial Council (ludco) or rhc
Grinncll college Hearing Board. JudCo normally deals with
drug and alcohol issues and problems in the residence halls, so
these students case fell under their jurisdiction, whilc Hearing
Board deals with assault, sexual crimes,and pioblcms ofa more
serious nature. Cases are usually not heard until any criminal
proceedings are ﬁnished

Eric Olson '08, SGA Vicc President of Acadcnlic Affairs,
wllo currently orrtrsccs lunch and is a past member or the
couilcil, said that the group exists as an extension otsclfegov—
crnince, “It's really just an additional level orscif-govcinancc,"
he said. “lfyou're unable to walk out something with another
lndividiial or an RLCJiidCds another way to do that within
the student realm.”

While for many students ludCc appears to be shrouded in
mystery, Olson said “I don't get the impression that it's very ine
timidaring [tor people involved in cases], and it's not designed
to be, In that icspccr ir serves its purpose as an ongoing Convch
sation with students."

Andrews said tllcie have been foul JudCo cases this school
year, which is more than zoooro7, but, according to Olson, on
par with carl ears

Tire punishments JudCo recnmmcnds can vary from ivarnr
irigs to expulsion, but Andrews said, its cducation[al] in re
gards to guiding them to not do that kind of action again, but
also in giving back to thc community. We try ro match the
sanctions with whats gone on, alluding especially to incidents
involving alcohol.

Olson said that ludCo has run effectively, in his cxperir
once. “We all rach it pretty seriously, but at the same time, it’s
not meant ro be intimidating or inirthing like rlmt' . thinL its
piertvt well embedded [in colicgc policy] Regarding whether
Student Affaiis follows their recommendation? Olson slid that

it varies ease to case .thcy ll either go more extreme oi cveii
lighter" regarding a punishment.

Andrews conceded that the procedure is not peitccr, pair~
1y because there is
no set guideline for
when a decision must
bc made. “I was (illk’
ing to onc student; hc
didn't find out about
his slruatioil for over
a month after the
Hearing Boaid had

curd his case," she
said.

hopes the process will move faster undei W. Houston Dough—
arty, the incoming vice president of Student Affairs. “I don’t
think it's fair to have students hanging out there," she said.

Security examines emergency policy, communication concerns

BYOMAR Mub’loz

Following last year's shooting at Virginia Tech and a shoore
ing this year at Northern Illinois University Grinnsll College
security continues to adapt to the possibilities for violent events
on campus. As shootings occur in colleges and universities
around the country campuses are discovering the difﬁculty and
importance of creating effective response plans,

Grinnell’s plan for responding to hostile situations on cam-
pus calls for individuals to get to shelter as soon as possible and
to wait for the members of the Grinnell Police Department,
who are armed, to arrive on campus.

While the college has had an emergency response plan
for some time, it is currently being reviewed to deal with new
situations. said Associate Dean and Director of Residence Life
Sheree Andrews. “The development
of the plan has been ongoing since
Virginia Tech,” Andrews said. “Since
then a lot of campuses are tee‘mluating
their policies.”

New changes aim largely at greater
involvement from the campus conir
munity in the crisis emergency plan
One such element is the institution of
Campus Emcrgcncy Response Team
[CERT] program on campus. “With
CERT, more people will get involved and that's the hope," said
Director of Campus Security Stcphcn Briscoc. “I’ve sent two
people to get trained with FEMA.Those two people will come
back and train people who are involved in CER

CERT is a national emergency response program that trains
students or other individuals already established on the campus
to streamline emergency response procedures. CERTrtraincd
individuals are given a duffel bag with a weather radio, ﬁrst aid
materials, and other emergency provi, us. They also receive
detailed instructions on how to help others get to pre~assrgncd
safe zones.

Currently, each academic building is assigned a building
coordinator to help security coordinate emergency responses at
academic buildingsThc building coordinators, assigned based
on the location otrhe sruftmcmber’s office, are responsible for

carrying out a lock down procedure and serve as contact per
sons in the event of an evacuation.

While the plan calls for greater involvement from indi-
viduals. the school has not run practice drills to allow staff
members to improve rhcir response abiiincs and learn the dif-
ﬁcultics of carrying out such a plan. Carolyn Bossc, Biology
Technical Assistant, who would be involved in an emergency
response, said that the response plan had not been attempted
in Noyce. “We have nor had an eiiieigency drill in this build
ing," said Bosse.

Briscoe said that Grinnell College has run drills but that
most are with city ofﬁcials. “We work With the city on drills to
hostile incidents. We had one simulation at the high school,"
said Briscoe. He also said that while they had not run a drill
for some time, the security other is
in the process otscrriiig up tor the
near future. “We have not done
many drills in the past. We're look-
ing at doing a drill in I\Iaicll and we
plan to do drills cvcly vcir were
ta lklng about a full scale drill with
us and the county and emergency
services."

Beyond general policy changes,
Briscoc sn Grinncli Campus sc»
curiry is looking at how to respond more crfccrivcly to hostile
situationslsnscoc said that security woiks iii conjuiicrion with
the Grinnell Police Department when responding to acts of
violence. “In the event of a hostile sltuation we would usu,
ally respond as first responders and then contact the Grinricli
Police Department immediately after." he said. “They have
weaponsiwe don't Ifit’s a weapons siruarion like that, they're
going to take the load on that,"s.lid Briscoc.

Captain Thcrcsa Peterson with the Gi'innell Police De-
partment said that if such an incident were to happen, their
primary concern would be to isolate the shooter. “Let’s say ir
happened at the Harris Center, we’d get people out of there
as soon as possible anti start sccntlng the petrmeter,"Pelerscn
said.

According to Pcteiseu. the department also has a specially

”We do have a tart/cal team, [But]
if we don’t have time to wait for the
team to show up, we’re going in ”

Captain, Grinnell Police Department

trained tactical team designed to take the lead in hostile situ-
ations, “We do have a [tactical] team," Petersen said. "It's a
multirjurisdictional team—we have officers and there are of-
ficers from Foweshick county."

In addition to the tactical team, Petersen said that all ofr
ficers are trained to respond to such situations and would so
if necessary. “If we don‘t have time to wait for the tac team to
show up, we’re going in,” she said.

Briscoe added that he wants to make new additions to the
response plan that could increase the safety ofacadeniic builde
ings without doors that lock automatically “I've asked for a text
messaging system for the campus, I Want to put intercoms in
all our buildings so we can rniit ro rhc cririre campus," Briscoe
said.

Bosse said that building coord'r
nators only have access to intercoms
in their office. “There are things
that could improve our ability to roe
spond but it requires funding." said
Bossc. Shc added that thc tcxr "165‘
sage plan would be more reliable
alld safcr but “there is little phone
reception iii the building." For such
a plan to be functional in Noyce,
they would hitvc to add reception
antennas in the building.

Planners strongly emphasized the role of communicne
tron in emergency response and Andrews said that rhcrc have
been plans to dcvciop a variety ofalcrr and inrorrnrriori sys-
tcms for the campus. “Tllcy'rc looking at a difrcrcnr kind
ofsireii warning system that the one in town which people al-
ways ignore," said Andrews. ”Instead of just a sound, it would
be something that would have words and might actually say
something."

Bossc said that she recognized that positive changes had
been made to the response plan. “Tltings are changing, The
Emergency Response Committee has been working on a plan
and I Cd“ tcll things have changed From what they asked us to
do last summer and what they're having us do now," said Bossc.
“They've made progress, but there's a way to go."
