Durant, widely known as the
author of popularized philosophy,
says that civiliation rests upon
four elements, economics, politics,

'morals and intellectual cultures—

with the last two being the most
important. It is the practical
recommendations for acnlﬁ‘f g
these elements that Durant‘ha
chosen as the text of his address
