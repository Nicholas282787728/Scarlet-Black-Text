In SItllC cl Ult‘ illfllll' rumors [0 (iii)
'coiiimly, "Aida“ has been deriuitcli-
booked to come to Gi-iunell on heicm-.
her 3. Tlii is the announcement made!
last Saturday by Messl” Criitcliticld
and Sears, the managers or the Co-
lonial Theater.

This is a sudden change on the part
of the inauagcrs as to the coming or
the giaud opera offering, since but a
short time ago they stated that thel
“Aida” contract would pi'obiilily be
cancelled. When asked concerning
this yesterday it was explained that
the ﬁrst announcement was given out
because nothing could he learned as
to the standards or the company, and
no company would be permitted to
play here unless it could he guarau»
teed to the public. Since then, how-
ever, the mauagers have learned
enough about the production to “rare
rant its derinite hooking.
Writes To Drnulntlc Crliic.

Mr. Crutchlield wrote to Edward c.
Moore, the dramatic ci- e of the on
edge Daily Journal, a short time ago,
asking for his opinion of the leading
soloists in the company. Mi. Moore,
replied that most or them had inst,

. come train Europe and he had not‘

heard them. The tenor soloist, how-
ever, Ernest Davies, was greatly prais-
ed by him. He said, in a personal lets
ter: “I heard him sing again about a
week ago, and was immensely taken
with him He has a splendid, big.
voice, with a lot or power and a lot of‘
control. He seems to understand his,
ioh thoroughly, and I believe that Kiel
would stand up well in any company."
Prof. Matlnck Praises Colllpzllly.

Professor hiatiack, or the School of
aiusic, was inclined last night to raver
the production. He said: “The opera,
elitizl,‘ is no child's play, and any o -
gan ation which undertakes it mlisil
he given credit {or the attempt to do a‘
serious work in a worthy manner. SoI
mar capable singers lime been coiir,
iitg to this country on account or the“
cl 3mg of opera houses in Europe that‘i

' it oli$t to be possible {or a company

like tlr- to have artists or n i-nuk.
I rcaily look tor a satisractorr pei'r
rurinancc [mm this company and do
not hesitate in the least to recommend,
it simply on the basis at climlllagillg
such cutei-piiscs and encouraging tlie‘
‘lllztlizigcliicllt or our theater to piescut
the best things they can obtain."

Tonight’s piograin con, s oi a Key-
stone comedy entitled, “Pei'llc in the
