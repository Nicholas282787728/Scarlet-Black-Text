Faunce Appeal

The c of HP last Tuesday
night 'rciccted an appeal from

Steve Faunco concerning his
fine for illegal use of fire-
works on Monday, May 31.

The fine was issued when
Faunce, a member or the Spring
Day committee, set off. several
firecrackers from the top of
Ward stadium in order to an-
nounce Spring Dayi Even
though the later iircworks ex-
hibition had been cleared with
the Grinnell Police, the use _o1
fireworks by Faunce had not
been approved by the c of HP,
as had been the custom in pre-
vious years, according to Dick
Ramsdell, c of HP president.

The c of HP thereupon fined
the Spring Day committee for
its violation oi the north carn-
pus fireworks rule. When the
council,later realized that it
lacked the power to fine a co
mittee organized as a subdiv
sion of the Student Council, it
withdrew the fine from the
committee.

The c of HF then felt that
“they had no choice but to fine
Faunce, as an individual, for his.
direct violation of the men’s
rules." The fine or $25 was
transferred to Faunce, with $10,!
suspended.

in other action the c of HP'
fined two freshmen $35 apiece
with $10 suspended for illegal
entry into .the Quad, The c of
HP also granted a Clark sopho-
more permission to keep a car
on campus with no social privi-
leges for. the academic year
1959-60, .

'The Sea Guii'

lently perturbed with the way
his play had been handled,
aiiirrning that he had conceiv~
ed a comedy, not a tragedy
as executed by Stanislavski.
The Grinnell players have
heeded Chekhov’s advice.

interestingly, Tolstoy round—
ly dismissed “The Sea Gull” as
“nonsense.” He commented fur»
ther that the play was "utterly
Worthless" and that it was writ.-
ten “just as thsen writes his
plays", This should be incen-
tive enough to see the perform-
ance.

The plot is easy to follow. its
central figure is an aumor, of
whom another character com-
ments: “With him, the neck of
a brokcn bottle glitters on the
dam and the mill wheel casts a
black shadow—and before you
is a moonlit night." ‘

Our romantic genius, Boris
Trigorin, irresistahly attracts
two women—one middlesaged,
the other young—and, of
course, cannot have both. or
rather, both cannot have him.
This theme, interwoven with
questions at such a fundamenr
ta! nature asV “what is Art?"
immnsks certain aspects of
bourgeois groveling.

Seven performers comprise
the cast.’Ned Donahoe projects
us into Boris Tl‘igorln’s flighty
world. His objcts d’art are
Irina Arkadina, an actress, as
Robert Voert~
man and Nina Zai-ietchnaya,. a
young girl. the daughter of a
rich landrowncr, as played by
Ellen Pctersllie. '

Mike Burr performs as Irina's
son, Constantine Triplieff, who
is committed to capturing ”Pure
Art,” and Bob Clapp appears}
as Peter Sorin, Irina’s brother:
Completing the cast are Meg
Davis as Masha, the daughter
of the manager of Sorin’s es-
tate, and Al Stanley as Simon
Medviedenko, a school master.

“The Sea Gull" glides with
a basic theme for three acts. ‘
and then moves quickly into ,
a coda or epilogue for thel
concluding act

The production is under the
direction of Donahoe, Director
of Theater, He .is assisted by
Richard Meyer (speech) who
also supervised the designing
and executing of the scenery
A play of this genre has not
been performed at Grinnell for
a good while and is well Worth

seeing for this reason and others
too. i
