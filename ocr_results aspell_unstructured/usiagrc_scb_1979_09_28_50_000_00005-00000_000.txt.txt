Funding found for ’80 yearbook

by Alex Serbs

Under pressure for a decision, the
student Publications and Radio Com~
mittee (spoilt) voted unanimously in
iavor oi the publication oi a yearbook
for this school year.

Chairman Marilyn Clark made a
mo-
tion to approve the publication or a
yearbook, but to hold oil signing a
contract with the publisher until the
contract could bethoroughly studied
This action cleared the way for Editor
Peter Levy to begin Grinnell Book
sales during Parent's Weekend.

During Friday‘s meeting. Levy
quelled fears that the yearbook would
lose money by providing a basic lor-
mat ior ﬁnancing the venture. The

iew ol the major ideas brought beiorc
the board received a definite decision.
Those that did were the agreements to
shop for a stereo {or all-campus par»
ties, write a letter to the yearbook
staii on SLAmbrose College protesting
censorship imposed on them, and not
giving the BStS $50 to cover production
costs

The meeting began with several
items oi minor importance, such as
reports lrom various members oi the
Joint Board, the election of Danny
Kadden and Bill Stowe to the Commit
tee oi Corporate Responsibility, and
the appropriating of $300 [rpm the
general budget for a waltz band,

Alter that, debate began on Whether
or not to appropriate money tor an all-
campus party stereo, With pro and
con iactions being virtually equal, and
iunds being precious. the members
agreed to sham around.

Next in line were proposals for
amending the Joint Board Constitur
tion. The passed amendment
stipulated that hall coordinators would
forfeit their positions if they didn't air

contract which is presently being con-
sidered would provide 400 copies of the
Grinnell Book at a total cost of $5,000,
or mac per copy. Levy plans to sell
the book [or $12.00 during first
semester and to pay the additional
$200 cost through a combination of
donations and advertisements. He
had already received $1,000 in dona-
tions by last week's meeting, so,
assuming all 400 copies of the book are
sold, it will be impossible to go into
the red.

Several signiiicant iormat changes
came to light in Friday’s discussions.
The yearbook will arrive in May this
year, rather than the usual timetable
of an early fall distribution the follow-
ing year,

to 3&5

tend Campus Coordinating Committee
meetings Several other proposed
amendments were defeated.

Attempts were made to amend the
Judicial Council's general operating
bylaws dralt, With only one amend»
ment passed, involving a simple res
wording, the drait was subsequently
passed.

Perhaps the most controversial
topic dealt with was whether or not to
give the staff of the BKISian
underground student newspaper—$50
to cover the cost of production.

A supplementary “Commencement
Edition” will also be published as a
separate undertaking, with a different
editor and staff. This edition will have
smaller dimensions and be less expen-
sive. If bought together with the
regular $1100 edition, there will be a
discount for the supplement. Levy
tools that perhaps 300 of these special
editions will be printed, because most
ot the members of the senior class
would want to buy a copy.

The contractual agreement between
the yearbook publishers and the col-
lege should be finalized by the

SPtizR in the near future. thus allow
ing the Grinnell Book organization to
move ahead as scheduled.

Peter Kornhaber, the representative
of the 3&5, outlined the expenses ree
tained by the staff members of the
paper, and presented his request ior
capital to the Joint Board, Kornhaber
listened to the complaints of board
members, and their expectations tor
the Oct. 1 issue.

With only three members of the
board voting for the underground
paper, Kornhaber commented, the
SGA exhibited a singular lack of con-
sideration for their fellow Students and
their collective conciousnesses.”
