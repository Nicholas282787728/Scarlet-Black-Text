The need of individual analysis
in considering the vocational pro-
blem will be the theme of Milton
E. Hahn, vocational coordinator
from the University of Illinnesota,
in a talk at 4:30 p. m. Friday
before the vocations group.

Those who plan to participate
in the job survey must attend
this discussion, said John w, P001-
ey, director of the vocational
forums.

“Speakers at the Friday after.
noon forums have been analyzing
individual Occupations such as
salesmanship, banking and invest-
ment. They have all mentioned
that to succeed in a job a person
must know about himself," Pooley
pointed out. “Hahn will present
methods in which the student can
analyze himself."

Along this line of self-investie
gaticn, Pooley said, Machin Card—
ner, Grinnell's public relations re-
presentative in Chicago, is now

The Life of a Teacher as Described by Crime]! Graduate
Esther Peck, ’3 6, Shown Not Boring—Jf Located in Greece

 

By Flancis Agar.

Vardar winds; beacons following
airplanes through the night sky;
Russian choral music on New
Years eve; flights to Sofia, Bagh-
dad, or Egypt; summers in an
.American camp in Switzerland;
a 1,250 mile bicycle trip from the
French Alps to Greece; Venicelll

Who ever said “there isn’t any
adventure in the life of a teache
er?! ,,

Miss Esther Peck, ’36, refutes
that often—heard expression in a
letter written to her mother,
Mrs, Paul F, Peck, and members
of the faculty. Miss Pack is an
instructor in Anatolia college at
Salonlki, Greece.

Miss Peck spent Christmas,
1938, in Sofia, Bulgaria, and has
taken several trips in connection
with her work. Last summer, she
worked at an American camp in
the French Alps,

She writes: “But the summer
like the spring passed too quick-

 

 

ly and gathering war clouds
brought camp to a rather abrupt
close, When September rolled
around and Germany cutcoed Poe
land, the problem of whether, and
how, to go to Greece would have
been acute if I had been alone.
They were trying to send all
Americans home. However, since
there were two of us, we solved
the problem by buying two of
the best French bikes with six
gears for climbing mountains;
and heaping what baggage we
could on the back and sides,
started to cycle the 1,250 miles
to Greece.”

Traveling up the Rhone valley,
she and her companion cycled
over the Simplon pass, altitude
6,590 feet, in a. driving rain.
“Then, since we were still alive,”
she writes. "we coasted on across
Italy to Venice where we were
welcomed like prodigal sons be~
cause all tourists had ﬂed,

"Next came the novel, muddy,
and somewhat difficult part of

the trip over the mountains and
soecallctl roads of lugoslavia,
and down the Dalmatian coast to
Dubrovnik. We should have vole
unteered to take the Jugoslavian
census.“ she says, “for rm sure
that every man, woman, child,
and horse in every village we
passed during- those days turned
out to see us.

“Even Jugoslaviah roads final-
ly came to an end. Aftcr follow~
ing a stony river bed and cross—
ing a few meadows, we arrived
at an unguarded spot on the
Greek border. Eventually we
found some officers who let us
enter the countryesincc we were
already in. From there on, the
Vardar blew us right into Salon—
iki; and we both lived happily
ever after.

“Our Christmas plans are not
settled yet," she Writes. “Maybe

we'll go to Baghdad, maybe to
Egypt. I'm rooting for Bagh—

 

dadl!"

NUMBER 25

to Face

Knox Five Friday

3 GRINNELL'S CHOICE l

": Grinnell, Ripon

Tied for First
In Midwest Race

By Jack Wile.

With a chance to make their
t\lldu’est conference wills folll'
lli fl l'ol\‘, the Gl'lnnell college
quintet Vu'ill face a breezy
Knox l' e on the Pioneer
court this Friday night.

The Pioneers, to date, have had
three straight wins in their con-
fcrence games, sharing first
place honors with Carleton and
Ripoll. In its first game, the
Grinnell quintet defeated Law-
rence by a score of 43 to 33, then
iinocked over Coe, 47 to 35, and
finished up its string by stopping
Monmouth, as to 33,

Ripon brought its wins to three
by defeating Bcloit last Monday
night, 36 to 29, Knox and Cor-
nell were Ripon’s other two vicA
two confer»
ence wins to its credit.

Knox, tied for second place with
Coe, has lost one game in three
league starts, turning- back Be-
loit and Lawrence, and losing to
RipOll.

Knox is somewhat of the “un-
known caliber" in this contest,
but its position in the conﬁerence
indicates that it is one of the
better teams. Burlington junior
college, which lost to Knox by a
score of 50 to 49, is rated among
tough opponents on all schedules.
The'only comparison that can be
made is that both Knox and
Grinnell have overpowered Law-
rence. The Pioneers, however, will
probably be pre-game favorites.
