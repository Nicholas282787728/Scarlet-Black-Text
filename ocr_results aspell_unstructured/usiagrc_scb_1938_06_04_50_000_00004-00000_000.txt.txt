NEED OF GRADUAL MODIFICATION

The new five-point grading system has
been in effect long enough that it can profi—
tably be examined,

Instituted by the faculty last fall,
partly to discourage the indiscriminate giv-
ing of high marks, which is unfair to the
good student, and partly to permit, by the
use of five grades instead of four, a more
discriminating estimate of any student, the
system has occasionally been criticized on
three points.

These criticisms should be examined.

One of the most frequent charges is
that B, the basic grade in the middle of the
scale, is not used by some instructors as the
basic grade but that F is used instead.
According to the grade average made by
the registrar, this is not true. As a group,
professors gave only 16.7 per cent F’s for
the first semester of 193138, and gave 44.7
per cent B’s. Furthermore, only one ill-
structor in the college gave more F grades
than B’s.

The logical conclusion seems to be that
the grade of F is not used often enough.
The distribution of grades recommended by
the faculty is H, five per cent of the total;
S, 25 per cent; B. 40 per cent; F, 25 per
cent; and P, five per cent. This means that
the mark of B should appear about as fre-
quently as it does, but also that there should
be an equal number of S’s and F’s and an
equal number of HS alid P grades, As a
matter of fact, P grades outbalanced H‘s
last semester by as little as eight-tenths of
one per cent, and SS outbalanced F’s by
10.3 per cent. At mid-semester in March,
S grades led F's by 5.4 per cent.

A second criticism of the new system
is that H is less frequently used than was
the old A. This is undoubtedly true, At
the end of the first semester 2. year ago,
12.2 per cent of all the marks given were
A’s, and a year later only 5.4 per cent were
H , The grade H is harder to get, but the
very fact that it is more difficult to get
means that it is more valuable

Unfortunately, it is not more valuable
measured by grade points. The old A was

GRINNELL SCARLET

three times the minimum grade-point re-
quired for graduation, being worth 3.,
\l'hereas only 1. was demanded for gradu-
ation. The present H is worth only about
two and a half times as much as the mink
mum graderpoint required for graduation,
H being counted as 4., and the point r A
quired for graduation being 1.5 or an aver
age mar i lying between B and F.

If there is any weakness in the new
system, it would seem to be here; but of
course one should add that if H is less

valuable than A, the new B, worth two‘

g de points instead of the 1.5 required for
gr dilation, is more valuable than the old
C.

There is still a third common criticism.
That is that there is, on the part of the
faculty, still some confusion as to the quality
of work required for certain grades. While
it is true that B is the basic grade, there is

little agreement as to what actually consti—‘l

tutes basic work. Hence, students may find
that equal amounts of effort expended in
two courses may result iii vastly varied
grades,

Here we think is the point which needs
clarification.

AU REVOIR, NOT GOODBYE

The graduate pictured above seems to
be feeling just 21 tinge of regret as he pre«
pares to leave his Alma Mater, Monday, you
seniors will be leaving Grinnell college. We
hope that you, too, will feel at least a tinge
of regret as .you leave the college where
you have spent the best part of four years
and the friends of those years, for we and
they feel sincere regret that you are leaving.

You will hear from others all the usual
cautions, inspirations and farewells. Our
purpose is but to voice a heartfelt wish that
you may not forget Grinnell and what it
has meant to you and that you may continue
your friendships here.

To that end, we say to you, not good
bye but Au Revoii

A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

Among the worthwhile projects on the
campus, which are often overlooked, is one
developed to a considerable extent by the
men of Rawson hall.

We refer to the Rawson hall library,
not because it is the only one of its kind,
but because it is an example of what can
be done in building up a hall library.

Several other halls have rudimentary
libraries, the women have the very efficient
and useful Lewis memorial library, but for
the most part such a developmenthos been
passed up on the men’s campus with this
one exception.

The idea is not new. It is one of
proved value. Hence, it is of interest to
note that Ralvson has built up a library of
over 300 volumes and is actively engaged in
making further additions

It has been proposed that a dormitory
library. similar to the Lewis libra be
developed

Such ti development may come.
meantime, individual hall libraries
step in the right direction.

Nor can we help but smile at
fact that the senior class not only
voted to purchase new hymnals
for the college but, through the
League Board and Student Coun-
cil, instituted a new practice of
holding meetings at a local pub.

After last \vcek—end’s purge,
those afflicted have been saying
they are now in position to sym-
pathize with the victims of the
Stalin regime in Russia who were
"liquidated."
