Comment

If you are a ”boojllm,” you are dangerous; if you are a
”snark,” you may be dangerous, But, this does not imply
that if you are a “snark,” then you are also a “boojum” and
are necessalily dangerous.

To carry this “businessman’s fallacy” a little further,
suppose that you are an American professor of biology who
teaches the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Sup-l
pose, also, that Communist biology professors teach the
same doctrine. Are you then a Communist given to sub-
versive teachings alid therefore dangerous to the education
of the youth of America? ,

Evidently you are. Recently, in olle American college,
a biology professor was dismissed for teaching the Russian
Lysenho’s doctrine of the inheritance of acquired character-
istics. .
This dismissal of professors from college and univer—
sities undoubtedly would follow American Legion principles
One of the proposals set forth by State Senator Broyles of
Illinois to the 10-state American Legion anti-subversive cone
ference was to “authorize the dismissal of teachers given
to subversive teachings.” We might assume, fromthe
above instance, that the professor in question was “given
to subveisive teachings.” . _ _

We, in the liberty of American colleges and llnlvel‘ISitles,
cry ”Tyranny!" when we hear of Communist activities
against i‘oreign education freedom. Yet, how closely paral-
lel are the examples of American suppressions of education
to those of Communist dominated countriesl

At Leipzig university, the purge began with the ousting
of the Rector, Professor Jacobi, a learned man, diplomatic
in his relations with the Communist authorities. But he
was an advocate of liberalism and il has stead was placed
a man who conformed, evidently, with party principles.
This was not the end, Subsequently, the deputy director
and the treasurer were replaced; 30 professors ﬂed from
the university to escape the Communist inquisitlon; an ex—
amination was devised to select palty-minded students; and
the Students’ Council Liberal and Christian Democrats
were sentenced to servitude in Siberia.

Paradoxically, higher education preaches freedom of
thought, non-conformity to orthodoxy, and the right to ex-
press the ideas of the individual intellect; and at the same
time, the actions of the preachers decry any adherence to
the principle. They illig'ically make “hoojums” of “sharks,"
calling them subversive, while they themselves undermine
the beliefs they seek to protect. . ,

Do the universities {ear that Lysenho’s doctrine \Vlll
become a menace to future generations through mental
heredity? Does the American Legion hope to destroy the
seeds of Communist totalitarianism by adopting the very
methods which underly oppressive government? We ask you.

I extend an invitation to all
Candidates for the Student
Council presidency to an open
forum Wednesday at 4:30 in the

this forum are is give the stu-
dent body an opportunity to:

1. Meet the Candidates.

2, Question them on stands
taken in their platforms.

2. Question them on any issue
not covered in their platforms.
1 think that by such a gather»
ing. the student body will have
a chance to better judge the
Candidates and Cast a more

meaningful vote.

Dear 5

There is a rule in the library
that no reserve books can be
checked out during Chapel hour,
That rule is stupid, disgraceful,
and sacrilegious—for the followr
ing three reasons:

LeRoy O’Leary
Dies of Cancer

In Des Moines

LeRoy c. O’Leary, 25, died
Thursday, Feb. 24, in the Vote
erans' hospital in Des Moines,
a victim of cancer. He is sur-
vived by his wife, Juanita and
his son, Mike, 3. Mass was said
by Father Farrely Monday, Feb.
23, at Emmetsburg, Iowa, and
the body was interred in the
Emmetsbllrg cemetery.

A Veteran of five years in the
Marines, Roy entered Grinnell
last year and was elected presi»
(lent of the class of ’51. He spent
most of the war in combat in
the south Pacific.

A sophomore, his former
Grinnell activities include fresh-
man track, where he won his
numerals, and participation on
various intramural teams for

 

Gl‘lnnell, 10W“ board for all.

Cowlcs hall.

 

, ,—

a. It is stupid, because it im»
pedes potential Phi Beta Kap»
pas in their quest for all knowl»
edge, thus directly opposing the
true Grinnellian's drive for ac
ademic perfection.

b. I: is disgraceful, because it
can hardly be described as be-
ing more than a coercive mea-
sure to force “individualists”
mm chapel. That indicates core
rosion on our prized Grinnell
doctrines bi free and intelligent
thought, -‘ ‘

is sacrilegious, because
by helping to remove any
chance for alternate activity
during chapel hour, it places the
chapel on a par with poolhalls
as a last resort for loafers.
What a joyride! Seriously, it
should be recognized that there
are times when Students Should
be permitted to check out re-
serve books over chapel hour.
These times come every Thurs

day morning shortly before ten
o’clock
