Professor Noble Points Out Need

lul good thing committed unto thee",
was the foundation of the talk and the
speaker sold in part: \

“As we come into consciousness oi
lite we have an inheritance entrusted
to us. The Spirit or Grilmell is to he
regarded as ieieient and a. trust The
self sneiiﬁces oi the founders built into
the college. the cum-age and energy of
the ﬁrst President, and the earnest-
ness and cheer oi George Gates, pus
mode Griimell stand tor manhood and
womanhood and each one has let: a de-
posit, that fair henntilul thing cur
