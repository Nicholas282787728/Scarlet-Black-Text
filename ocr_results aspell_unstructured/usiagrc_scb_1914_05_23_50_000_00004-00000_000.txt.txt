Scott‘s "Lotus Land.” For an encore
to the second group, Miss Elvyn res
turned to play an arr-nagemeut at the
"Sextette from Lucia" {or the leit hand

tor-med the only encores,

A wonder-till director, satisfying
music, and the presence or two ﬂee
lightiul soloists comhined to make
the Wednesday aiternoou concert at de-
cisive success. The rolliching “Sor-
carer‘s Apprentice," 2. Dukes Scherzo,
played by the Chicago Symphony 01
chestra under Mr, stock's magnetic
control, had the most popular appeal
for the large audience, and Lamhert
Murphy, who, of the tour Festival solo-
ists, was the most enioyed, was re-
peatedly encored.

The ”Sorcerer's Apprentice" was
thoroughly delightful, portraying in
tone the experience of an apprentice
who experiments with magic, w ohut
knowing the cryptic phrases of (tissue
chantrnent. The evident enjoyment oi
the orchestra in this numher added to
the novelty.

Mr. Murphy‘s ﬁrst. number was the
heaut ul Masscnet Aria, “V r Glis-

elidis", which he rendered with ﬁlie‘

enurrciation and a wonderful liquid
beauty of tone. He was twice rer
called; the dainty freshness oflhe rasc
lyrics which he sang was enhanced by

Tire “popular program" or the Festi-
val occurred Wednesday evening, with
orchestra and Oratorio society, assist-
ed by Miss rnez Bnrllour, soprano, and
Mr. iienri Scott, haritone “The Death
or Minnehaha" was the contribution or
the Oritorio Society, and ior this ﬁrst
part or the program Proi. Pierce was
director. Mr. Stoch resumed the halon
tor the orchestral nnmhers which fol-
lowed. The sweet, sensuous ”Alton
noon with a Faun" and the stirring
ﬁnale, “Dds Rheingold", were deserv-
edly favorites.

The Dehussy “Afternoon" had heen
anticipated with much interest, ior ii
is a type of composition seldom in-
cluded on iestivai programs. The de—
lightiul melody, voiced in sort. low
tones, and with exquisite phrasing won
instant appreciation.

The crashing strains oi “Dds Rheiu»
sold" concluded the orchestra inim-
hers. Its very familiarity makes it her
loved, and the full orchestra more
than did justice to the famous \Vag-
nerian “jumble or melodies."
