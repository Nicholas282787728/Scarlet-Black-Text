To the Editor:

The writer or the column
“Sackcloth and Ashes" obviously
has some strange triends. Where
did he find it in the Bible or
church doctrine that it is wrong
to speak in a chapel about
homosexuality, provided it is
done in good taste and with
honorable intentionsias it was
last Wednesday by Professor

Thompson

round that they have a load of
responsibilities that would make
a girl like Georgia throw up her
knitting. ,

Maybe you can see that the
real problem is in Georgia her-
seLf~the average Grinnell girl
that doesn’t care enough to ask
questions. She is one of the
most pitiful examples of the cite
izen in a democracy: she doesn’t
have an opinion.

And I’ve made her repre—
sentative of the “average Gri .
nell girl” because she is in
the MAJORITY. The majority
that follows where it is led—
the slaves in a democracy.

The LB welcomes the opinions
of the “malcontents”—if they
are expressed IN HOUSEMEET-
INGS If Georgia ever does form

harps for the first time, it is
showing its willingness to take
responsibility. it decided to pun- ,
ish individuals mistreating Cokel
machines. The iirst time in its
recent history that it has been
willing to accept any punitive
power.

It has agreed to serve as Tar
sponsible chaperones at Lake
Acre, and has empowered the
Central committee with the job
of punishing individuals or

groups who damage the prop—'

erty or into the
illegally. M

Yes, Virginia, there is a
Student Council, and this year
it has improved its position
as the ofticial organ of the
student body. it has been a
sounding hoard tor student
complaints and praise for ac-
tions or the administration.
Dave Hubbard has worked
with buildings and grounds all
year and has done a Wonderful
job. Incidentally, Virginia, the
presidents of the men’s halls
turned the job of working with
buildings and grounds over to
the vice—presidents. Not because
thev didn’t want responsibility,
but because the Council had
shown its willingness to work
hard in this area.

I could go on, Virginia, and
list the other things that the
Council has done this year,
butiwant to impress you
with the willingness of the
Council to accept responsibili»
ties in problems affecting the
student body as a whole. For
this reason, Virginia, I have
supported this proposal tor
liaison.

Yes. Virginia, there is a stu-

go cabin

dent Council, and I appreciate"

.Vour faith in it.

WE HOPE
YOU HAVE A
Merry
Chrisimqs,
a Happy
New Year.
and a nice
Vacu'l'ion.

Those persons who have spok—

matter have apparently confused
the tear oi God with the fear
of Madame Grundyeand they’re
really not the some at all. Let‘s
leave the curtains open.

an opinion, it will never do any
work if she expresses it in a
“bull session" after the meet
ing.

The “reporter question," I re~
alize, is not a matter of life—
and—death. Women’s government
won’t collapse if nobody speaks
up in housemeetings. The LB
will carry on as it always has,
doing the coolie-work that has
to be done.

But Georgia‘s blissful ignor-
ance and lack ot opinion can
lead to nothing but a sick
kind of substitute for a citi—
zen.

So pick up your knitting and
go home, Georgia Glotz—you
may be able to sew your own
clothes, cook a good dinner, or
have fun on a dateebut thinks
ing about your lack of cone
sciousness almost makes me sick,

(SEE PARAGKAWI BELOW

A PLEASANT PRESENT like cartons of Luckies can make
a dolly jolly or a pappy happy. And they’re just the
things to cheer up a glam chum or a gloomy roomie.
So the guy who gives loads of Luckies, of course, is a
Pmper Shopper. He appreciates Luckies' better taste—
the taste of mild, goodrtasting tobacco that's TOASTED
