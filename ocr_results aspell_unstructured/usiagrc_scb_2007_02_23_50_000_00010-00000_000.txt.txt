Buildings aren’t only problem with accessibility

Two students recently made a vrd-
eo addressing the accessibility of the
crinnell campus. They rode around
campus in a wheelchair, finding it dif-
ﬁcult to get over railroad tracks or get
into many buildings. The video, ac
cording to the students who made it,
was to draw awareness to Giinncll’s
lack of accessibility, despite its ADA
compliance,

Challenges faced by the disabled
range from difficulties crossing the
railroad tracks to the lack of a batlr
room on the first ﬂoor of the library.
Most able-bodied students do not
notice these problems. Still, admi
istrarors are trying
to make the college
more accommodate
ing. Convocation
has closed captions.
An ndthoc Colnmlk
tee on disability has
members from all parts ofcampus givr
ing input on how to make this commu-
nity friendlier to those whose bodies
have different limitations, And while

new buildings on campus do have mule

that, at least
in theory, have

These coli-
ccrns are an
i m p o r t a n t
and legitimate
grievance, but
we as students cannot looksolcly to the
administration when talking about the
difficulties of the disabled in Grinnell.
We must also acknowledge that we
perpetuate these
problems in our stu
dent culture, We

causc health prob-

lems at our age are both unusual and
unsettling,

It is the students of Grinnell who

must begin to take a larger role in cm,

aring a campus that has ﬂexibility and
understanding for all. When faced
wrth disability
euiselves, few of
us even recog-
nizc what we see.
We make jokes
and we make «Sr

Most students
here learn to “as

not on people arorrad them are wirrte,
straight or male. Yet no one notrces
the widespread assumption that all srur
dents arc healthy. if they are not, they
should leave, get cured and come back.
It’s awkward, because to ask is to ace

knowledge difference and to ignore is
to be callous. Either way, we feel we
did it the wrong way

So let us start from a new direction.
Instead ofadjustliig our behavior when
we see someone who seems different,
let’s adjust our behavior regardless of
who’s around, speakrng loudly and
getting doors are helpful to everyone.
When faced with a person who may
need help, just offer. Don't ask what's
wrong don’t try to avert your eyes and
walk faster, A quick
and honest, "Can I
ielp?" is all anyone

At Grinnell, we
often talk about how
to make this a place
welcoming to all.
But by assuming
the health of those around us, we, and
not just the administration, dishonor
our own lofty goals.

Our consumption choices should be ethical

I felt sick several mornings ago. The sickness was
brought on not by the virus going around, but by
something I had read while gouig through my moms
ing mantra of browsing Netvbased news sources, I
read an article probing the conditions under which
the chocolate that goes into making cocoa pcwdcr
and candy bars is produced These conditions were
not good: child slavery res

pietc with physical abuse
lack of sanitation, bonds
age. I thought back to in

evening cup of hot choco-
late, made by the excel-
lent people at Saint's Res
doubtless using Nestle co,
coa powder. Nestle ranks
among the worst businesses in the world with unt
ethical trade practices that help maintain huge proﬁts
and monopolies. Nestle products are ubiquitous, and
I find it hard to steer clear fohCmtAE the some time.
I recognise that 1 am complicit in a heartless economr
ic system and that changing my own consumption
habits can help change the system. Today, we want
to consume more but pay lcss.This habit means that
those who can be underpaid, those most marginalised
and without recourse to legal old, are underpaid.

The problem at the heart ofissues ofchild slavery
and sweatshop labour is that the situation in certain
countries makes these places prime ground for less
thantethical and downright exploitative practices.
Many of the businesses involved in the chocolate
industry take advantage of the situation. They buy
crops at unsustainably low prices from farmers who
subsist on a hand-to-mouth basis. The advent of hat-

the entire problem, but it is a good
start. Ofcourse,we must first know
what fair trade is. Fair trade ensures
that farmers in developing countries receive a living
wage and that certain leg] and ethical standards are
met. The point is not to make farmers rich; it is to
ensure that farmers at the bottom of the scale have
enough money to live on. Businesses receive fairtrade
certification when they are determined to follow the
frve principles ofrair trade: guanrnteeing a fair price,
establishing direct relations with farmers and coop-
eratives, ensuring democratic organisation, provid-
ing access to credit and protecting the environment.

Dctractors of fair trade have had trouble keeping
up with the times. Many products are now available
tair-tradt, includrng bananas, coffee, chocolate and
wine. There are wider sclcctions now, and the prices
have become more reasonable. A fair portion of sales
revenue returns to the community of farmers who
produce the beans ilntl fruits, farr enough to ensure
sustainability of the industry and a decent life for
farmers and workers. The few extra pennies that we
pay are a small price for ethical trade.

Replacing unethical businesses \Vllh certified fair
trade busrnesscs shows that we support the business

 

that cares about doing what is right, and it shows

 

unethical businesses that we will not tolerate their
exploitative practices. Such businesses might be per-
suadcd to become more ethical,
especially as fairrtrade increasingly
becomes the vogue, Sure, fair
trade products might cost double
the price. However, most of us can
afford to consume half of what we
normally do. Cutting consumption tends to be bet-
ter for both our own health and for the environment.
Ethical consumption does not have to mean giving
up our favourite chocolate bars all at once. It does not
require protests or boycotts. Ethical consumption is
about being aware that there are choices, and that we
are responsible for the choices we make.
