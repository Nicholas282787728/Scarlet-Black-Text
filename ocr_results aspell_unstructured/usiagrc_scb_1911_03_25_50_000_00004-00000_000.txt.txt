Beiorc ism-i, basketball played a
small part in girls' athletics. Since then
it has grown in interest year by year,
until at the present time it holds a
place at distinction. Tire series each
year has been carefully recorded and
the banner as it now stands shows
the iollowing record:

THE 1911 TEAM, CHAMPIONS OF GIRLS‘

for this reason it is made up or has-
ketball enthusiasts. This is why
such a deep interest is shown in the
games by the players. in comparison
with the boys' basketball, there is lit
tle rivalry in our series.

This year's winning team deserves
special mention. 1911, thro all tour
years has never held lower than sec-
ond plus, which means that the Scar-
let and Grey have played in the cham-
pionship game every year. 1911 start-
ed on her basketball career with Grace
Mcllrath as captain, and with a super-
nnity of players, as is usually the case
with ireshmen teams. Jessie Uhl was
captain the second year, and hurling
both Freshman and Sophomore years
1911 was defeated by '09.

After ’09 left school there was more
rivalry in girls‘ basketball, on ac-
count of the uncertainty of the one
come. So the last two years all ﬁve
teams have been more evenly matched.
Floy Korns was captain of 1911 last

THE GIRLS’ SEASON.
(By Rachel Home).
The Girls’ basketball series is end
ed with the class o11911 champions tor-
the second time. This out-come was
more or less expected because the Jim-
iors who proved their strongest obpon
ents last year were much weakened by
the loss of three good players who did
not return to Grinnell this yearr Con-
sidering this, the 1912 team'nnder tbe
captainrship of Ha ret Eldridge work
up into much better term than was an.
ticipoted and no large scores have been
made against them,

113‘s CHAMPIONSHIP

Tho Sophomores have played good
ball all season and their team work
‘llns been excellent. Mabel Meals and
‘ilclillio Rule, the two tor-wards, have
been in the garlic together all ihril
their High School course, and prob
ably play together better than airy
Jennie
Rule has been captain.

'l‘lle Frcsbmen probably sprung the
greatest surprise of the season. Tllo
nrany old high school stars orterr show
up in the entering class, not a great
deal is expected of them on account ot

'thcir lack ot experience in team work.
This year proved zul exception when

ithe Freshmen gave the Seniors the
hardest game oi the year. Tire ﬁnal
score was 9 to 4 in favor or 1911. Al-
tlro all ot the Freshmen played celr
lent ball, Helen Miller as girard and

Wilma Chambers as forward deserve

special mention.

captained the team.

The Senior Class, tho smallest in
numbers has had more girls out l'egu'
larly for practico than any other class.
Floy Korns and Clara Lane have ﬁlled
the for-ward positions in the games,

sie Uhl and Helen Mills have all been
used as centers While Helen MCGill
(captain), Rachel Harris and Florence
Swine: have ﬁlled the guard posi-
tions, The class team for the
tour years has been made up ironr
these people so that the girls have had
a. great deal of experience in plr ying
together,

Girls' basketball has many opponents
and there are many reasons why it
seems that there is hardly the place for
it here in Grinnell with its manifold
outside work.

Yet, girls have enjoyed the games
and tor the most part it has proven
a sucessliil season.

THREE HUNDRED GIRLS TAKE
PART 1N GYM. EXHIBITION

Milttm‘y Drill and The Highland Fling
the Best Numbersrlimtrc Pro-
gram Excellent,

The appearance of the three hundred
Grinnell girls who are taking gymnae
slum work under the direction or Miss
Andersen, as they assembled on the
main lloor of the Men’s Gymnasium tor
the Grand March. Saturday night, was
greeted with enthusiastic applause
from the large audience which had
gathered to witness the exhibition oi
the work that has been done during
the year. The specmcle was an in
spiring one, and the excellent program
which iollowed gave ample proof that
the physical life of thc Grinnell girl
is being well taken care or indeed.

Tho full program oI the exhibition
was printed in a previous issue, so it
will suttico it we call attention to
some oi the particularly good parts.

Two numbers by the Seniors and

 

Jilnl01'57lhe lndion Club drill and the
Highland Fling, given in Costumk
showed much skill. The latter was
especially enjoyed by the onlookers,
and the Scotch maidens dressed in the
gay plaids of the Highlanders receiv-
ed an enthusiastic encore. The Dutch
dance, given in costume by the Senior-
girls proved a popular number.

The best thing on the program was
the Military Drill given by sixteen
Sophomores, They were trained to a
nieety, and their marching would pass
muster anywheraieven in Co, K.

The Freshmen did some good work
with the wands, and in the Swedish 9x1
ercises gave a, very adequate idea of
the everyday work ot the giiinnasium
classes.

The audience took especial delight
in the work of the children‘s class.
They gave a group of singing games
and gymnastic exercisesitlle latter
disguised under more alluring titles,

The entire program reilectcd much
credit upon Miss Andersen, and gave
a good demonstration at the very cxr
oellent work that is being done among
the girls along physical lines.

IIARTSON, 'US, LEADS CHAPEL.

The attendants at chapel Thursday
had the pleasure of listening to a for-
mer student, Mn Louis Ilartson, '08.
r r. Hartson has been doing special
work in psychology since his gl'dduar
tion, ﬁrst at Columbia and now at
Clark University, He will take the dies
gl'ee of Doctor 01 Philosophy from
Clark next Julie. He is El. brother of
the late Ralph Hartson, whose death
called him from the East.

Mr. Hartson took occasion to make
a protest against the prevalent habit of
many Grinnell students to lose sleep,
overwork, and waste their physical
power He lizid the blame for this to
”a misinterpretation of the Grinnell
Spirit," He claimed that lnostathieics
remain in athletics when they actually
lack tllc time and physical strength to
do so properly, because they think the
College demands it of them. Tim
speaker pied for a saner and more con-
siderate attitude oil the part or the
students toward the men who feel that
they cannot do everything they are
asked to do, and urgcd that we respect
the needs or our body and mind more

Tire Girls Glee Club covered lhenr
selves with glory i may night, whrn
they appeared at Herrick Chapel in tho
iourth annual Hollis Concert, directed
by Mr. David E, Peck.

There are so many complimentary
things that might be said oi their
singing that it is diticult to make
selection for a briet criticism. Two
or three points stood out above the
rest, however, allll are worthy of CSl‘eC-
ldl recognition. Their attacks were
almost per-loot and lacked Hie common
error of being broken or meulinliiral.
At the other extreme, they have mas
tered the art or ending a song well,
and did not allow the last few notes
to straggle in hit or miss and spoil the
etlect oi the entire selection.

The Gills‘ Club excels in light, trip-v,
ping music and can render stacatto pas l
sages almost laultlcssly. it was prob-‘,
ably along this line that they did then i
best work.

The voices blcnd ver well this year, ,
and there is good balance among the|
lour pal-ts The ensemble elrect was'
excellent,.especially in the piarri simo
p- uses. it was in the matter oi :1in
ma s, probably that the Club “as the'
weakest. in very tew pieces was there
the vigor, assurance and whole-hearted
rress, such as was brought out in "The
Year's at the Spring,"

The program was an excellent selccr
tion, and possessed an abundance oi
variation, which made it doubly inter
esting, It opened wrtlr two heavy nnnr
here: “The Lark Now Leaves His was
ter-y Nest," by Richards, and the “Elﬁn
Song." by Chadwick, The ﬁrst showed
the usual stillness or a ﬁrst nunrber,
The latter, an exceedingly diilicult
composition, was excellently done,
it gave opportunity tor much at the
light, stacatto singing, mentioned be-
tore. For an encore, the Club gave
“What the Chimney Sans." This tlrev
interpret as well as anything in their.

 

crrtrr-c repertoire.

The oldetrinc ballads [Tom the Scotch,
l i and English, were lreautllul, and
made a deep appeal to the audience,
There is nothing in music that can
crpral those in simplicity and charm.
The group consisted or “Drink To Me
Only With Thirrc Eyes": ”Believe Me, ii
All Those Enricaring Young Char-ms";
and Loch Lonlnnd”; with “Sweet and
Lo ‘." as {Lil eliome.

01' the group or Children’s songs,
'Bed time," by birdiey Buck, was the
best. it was very pleasingly inter
preted The other two were “My
Shallow," by Hadley; and a Mother
(loose medley by Sher-wood.

"Land Sighting," by Grieg was, in
our opinion, the best rendered number
or the program. For an adequate in-
terpretation, hon-ever, this gl'zlutlscolllr

on would require a chorus ot
incns voices about a hundred strong

The closing numbers were two that
are always iavoritcs with Gi-iilnell air
dicnces, Dvorak‘s “Songs My Mother
Taught rile," and Mrs. Beach's, “The
Years At the Spring," They were
ilnely rendered, the last one being l'e~
heated ill. the call tor an encore.

Th solo work oi the evening was
well handled by Miss Attwooll and
Miss Chaney. Mrss Attwooli gave two
snlcntlrrl soprano numbers, “The Night-
ingale," by Salter; and “Springtime of
Love," by iiostltows * Miss Chaney
rcndcrcd Borowskr's Mazurka No, 2.
Her playing was marked by brilliancy
and an abundance 01' pouer Both sola-
iSLS “el'e encorcd licartl

A quartet consisting or Miss Weaver,
iliss Korns, Miss Harris and Miss Reid
gave :1 group 0| two numbers: “For-
sake br a Koscllat, and a Madrigal,
by beers, The voices blended well, and
the songs were adequately handled;
but the choice of selections might have
been improved upon,

The stunt, “Vivo Grinnell,” was done
by eight girls, each representing a difr
t'erent lowa college. They wound the
uiaypolo with the colors oi their clroe
scn school and sang or its glories, each
time, however, ending with a retrain
to Old Gl'inilell, As an encore, each
girl substituted a Grinnell pennant
[or those of the other colleges, and
sang “The Scar-let and Black," by Ros-
siter Cole.

The concert was one or which the
Girls‘ Glee Club and Grinilell may well
be proud. it reﬂects much credit

.iipon both the organization and its di-

rector, lllr. Peck. J. G. D.

 

CLARA JULIA
AN APPRECIATION.

It is comparatively easy to express
Ono‘s appreciation of work which has
been faithfully done, but when one ens
deavors to express the'love and appre-
ciation of three hundred girls [or the
woman who is to them a friend and an
inspiration, words seem inadequate.
llliss Andersen's work in Grinnell has
been above criticism. She has made of
the girls‘ athletic department here one
of the strongest in the slate, and the
former much used phrase, ”getting out
or gym," is almost unknown now.

There is no doubt but that Miss Ans
dersen has done much tor the physical
weliarc ot the girls oi Grinnell, rind
her great desire s to keep in every
young woman here that girlish lite and
buoyancy which a lii'e or nrirclr study»
ing is so liable to crowd out piss
Andersen believes that a strong and
well body is the greatest aid to ones
mental development, and so patiently

and persistently has taught this great
truth, that few girls who have had
work under her dircetion will be like-
ly to forget it.

it is the personal inter-est which
Miss Andersen takes in every girl
which has given her such an unusually
strong hold upon the young women
here, and each girl feels that in Miss
Andersen she has a friend and sympa-
thizei:

ever hold the deepest [eeiing or
love. Everyone can see and judge the
good results or litr work here, but the
inﬂuence of her life can never be
