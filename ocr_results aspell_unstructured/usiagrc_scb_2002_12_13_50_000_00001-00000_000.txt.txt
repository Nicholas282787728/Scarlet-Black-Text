Dorm computer labs may

Swariz says, but costs add

Speaking beroi-eioint Board one week
after the student body overwhelmingly
approved an lltllluxlvc calling for more
dorm labs, Dean of the College Jim

that ﬁscal discipline will motivate what

The plan would transplant one oiSouth Campus’s three
labs to the new East Campus doi ms, thi't-e ofwhich will

No other lztbs would be closed under the plan.

The plan also includes the further improvement or
Grinncll’s two-year-old wireless network, which Francis
has long argued will reinforce a recent trend toward stu-
dents' bringing their own computers to campus. in turn,
he said Monday, increased usage of Recht (which has

retention of all existing dorm labs.

with the initiative, but Francis told the son when the
in plan was released that "reiteration orpoints already
brought up" by opponents to the plan would "not be
persuasive," The administrators did not comment on a
draft orthe initiative provided by SGA members.

One issue that had not been frequently discussed
was brought up at the meeting, and seemed to emerge
as the central reason for lTS’s decision to reduce public
lab facilities: expense. when Erik Burton ’03. who came
to Joint Board to express his opposition to the new plan,
said that lab upkeep seemed like at most a marginal cost
to ITS, Swartz responded that marginal costs add up,

“Jacob [Kaufman-Osborn ‘04] comes to the budget
steering committee and says we need to hav: a really
low tuition increase," said Swartz, tcrerting to the stu—
dent representative on the committee. “That's how
they‘re linked."

other students countered Francis's contention that
increased ResNet usage necessarily removes the need for
computer labs, saying they are useful for specialited sort,
ware, and that many students may have computers but
not printers, or may have to leave their rooms to let a
roommate sleep. Still others said that laptop purchases
