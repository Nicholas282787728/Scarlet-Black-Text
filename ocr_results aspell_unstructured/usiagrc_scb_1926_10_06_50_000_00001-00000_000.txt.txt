Work is progressing rapidly on
“The Enchanted Collage," the comedy
by Sir Arthur Pinero which the Dm-
mntic club has chosen to present as
the Homecoming play. Friday, Octo—
ber 15, at the high school auditorium

The action is laid in a cottage which
is part of an old bul-oninl hall that
has been partially destroyed. A mus-
sive fire place that formerly was a
part or the old hall lends an air of
grandeur and distinction to the little
cottage. Relics from the old manor
give the dwelling the charm of trar
ditionul mystery.

Within the plny proper is n dream
which will take the lend pi n ballet.
T is dream cast is to be selected and
and directed by Miss Ciel-n Andersen.
Unique clients for the bullet will be
obtnined by novel lighting.

Sccueiy luv the play is under the
supervision of the Flay Production
class. Although portions of several
old sets crczbeing remodeled, a great
deal of construction is necessary, and
the classes have been working steudr
ily on a new set that promises to be
unusually attractive.

“European school are so very differ-

scarcely knows what to shy," declared
Mi s Brilciu Dedillsky, instructor in
French, when asked by a Scnrlct and
Blilck reporter to explain that dillelu
cllcc. “There is little social lire as you
know it here, in the continental
schools. Most or the orgnnizntions
and societies are intellectual rather
than social and their meeting are for
study and reading. In the thrcc yours
I spent nt Geneva university the (lee

"Of course,” said Miss Dcdinsk)’,
“there is for loss democratic spirit

partly due to tile fact that most or the

The Pioneers opened their h/eime

broken field running of ”West Stotts,l

well for Grillliell were Meeter, Duke,

Grinnell substantial gains by an ex-

In the line, Ted Peterson played a
great game at, the pivot position. His
passes were ,ponsistently good and be
frequently broke through the line to
smear Simpson plays. At the wing
pnsiuons Niblo and Robertson per-
tornied well. Both showed speed and .
hard-hitting una 'es which demoral-
izcd the Simpson interference. Rob-

terierence and to splash through it-to
get the man with the ball made him
especially dangerous on end plays.
