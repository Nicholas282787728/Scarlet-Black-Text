Enrollment restructured, Lincoln new V. P.

by Christopher Hetcher and
Alexander Kambouroglou

Overthe summer, struc~
tural changes were made in the
administration of the Admise
sion and Financial Aid Ofﬁces,
with the goal in mind of ﬁne—
tuning the college’s recruiting
and enrollment procedures.

Of the resrnicturing in
theseoffices,President Pamela
Ferguson said that in order to
be excellent, a college requires
three key elements: good fac-
ulty,faci1ities and studentsThe
way to maintain a quality stu-
dent body and increase the die
versity of the student body, ac-
cording to Ferguson, is to re
cruit students “in a sophisti-
cated and economical manner,“
laying equal stress on both ad-
jectives.

Ferguson pointed out
the advantages of having as di—
verse a student body as pos-
sible. Referring to her time in
Miami after an upbringing in a
more homogeneous commu—
nity, Ferguson said that living
in a community varied in its
character and composition
gives students an advantage in
becoming prepared for the
world of the next century. At a
small competitive college like
Grinnell, Ferguson said, we
cannot have a great deal of di~
versity in academic ability, but
we can have multicultural and
socioecenomic diversity as well
as great diversity and talent in
the arts, sports and other areas.
According to the president, an
efﬁcient yet cost-effective re—
cruiting program aimed at at—
tracting a wide diversity of ap-

plicants is the best way to ob-
tain this goal,

Student body diversity,
said Ferguson, does not just
mean multi-ethnic or multirae
cial composition, but also di-
versity in talent, regional and
socioeconomic backgrounds.
Ferguson emphasized that
Grinnell’s sophistication and
efﬁciency in recruiting and stu-
dent retention will be devele
oped and maintained while re—
taining Grinnell College’s
policy of need-blind admisv
sionsr SaidFerguson,“We will
be needrblind as long as I am
president."

The obvious adminis-
trative result of this restructur—
ing is the creation of the post of
Vice President for Enrollment,
filled by former Director ofFi—

Spears: The effort continues

continued from page 1

from the beginning came after
a week and a half of effort by
Grinnellians, Zywicki‘s friends
at other schools, alumni, fac-
ulty members, the Illinois State
Police and the FBI to deter—
mine Zywicki’s whereabouts

The student effort to find
Zywicki, which began imme-
diately after news of her
disappeamcereachedGrinnell,

drew considerable mediaatten-
tion, as well as support from
the college. The physical plant
contributed reams of paper, la,
bels and envelopes, as well as
photocopiers and conference
rooms. The public relations
ofﬁce paid for the photocopy,
ing of fliers, and the book store
offered free use of its FAX
machine

For several days, friends
of Zywicki ran a campaign to

get fliers distributed by mail,
while other students and their
supporters distributed ﬂyers by
automobile overa huge area of
the country.

A candlelight vigil held
the evening of August 26 was
followed a week later by
Wednesday’s sunrise vigil
which drew hundreds of stue
dents, faculty members and
Grinnell residents together for
prayer and mutual support.

nancial AidJanies Lincoln. The
new ofﬁce oversees and coor»
dinatesRecruiting, Admissions
and Financial Aid functions,
while the Admissions and Fir
nancial Aiddepartmentsare still
administered directly by their
own directors C u rr e n t l y,
Nancy Maly and Gretchen
Zimmerman are acting as di-
rectors of Admissions and Fie
nancial Aid respectively.

The directors of the two
departments,Fergusonsaid,are
responsible for “more in the
trenches,daytoday”work, The
new VicevPresident’s office,
Ferguson said, is an advantage
for both departments because
the kind ofworkitwilldo in the
way of ﬁne»tuningenrollement-
related functions, working to
ward the goalof greater student
body diversity, and making
Grinnell more competitive with
other schools for high quality
students. This is the kind of
work that two department di-
rectors with no coordinating
ofﬁce would have no time to
do.

Nancy Maly,actingDi-
rector of Admissions, agrees
withFerguson. Developing and
implementing enrollment
policy procedure strategies is
“particularly important"forthe
next decade which will be the
most competitive for the Col»
lege since the declining nume
berof 18 year old students is at

its lowest point, Maly said,
Colleges in the country will
have to compete for a smaller
number of students. The new
position will allow Gtinnell to
see a bigger picture, and will
help the Office of Admissions
coordinateitsactionswithother
areas of the campus such as the
Alumni Office , Student Af-
fairs, and Financial Aid Office,
“I’m pleased with it,“ Maly
said, “because enrolling stue
dents should be a total Campus
effort. Retaining students
should be a total campus effort.
So having an enrollment mane
ager in place will help us all in
doing that better.”

Inhisnewrole, Lincoln
wants to insure that the college
providesforitsstudentsa“qual~
ity of service beyond what the
student pays for.” Discussing
the coordinating functions of
his new ofﬁce, Lincoln emphae
sized the importance of main—
taining inter-ofﬁce communi-
cation, information distribu-
tion, cost»effectiveness and ef
ﬁciency in dealing with stu-
dent questions and problems;
in other words, “improving the
turnaround time."

Maintaining and im-
proving the geographic, socio-
economic and other diversities

Lincoln, requires making and
