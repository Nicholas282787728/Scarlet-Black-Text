Every toll for the pest four or
ilve years the question has arisen.
"Wlult's wrong with the Grinnell
tootbell team?" This year the
question must he restnted. There's
nothing wrong with the toys
themselves. They've heen out
there ﬁghting all season to pro-
duce wins tor the students, The

No, the question this year is
“What's wrong with football at
Grimell?" Well, here’s the an—
swerl Grinnell csnnot hope to
compete on even terms with most
of the schools it now schedules
unless it competes for players on

Now that's all very well, and
it would be very nice if Grinnell
would go out in the open market
and get her players in competi-
tion with the other schools. But
the standards at Grinneli heing
whot they ore, end her rinsncisi
standing oeing whet it is, such an
eventuality is rather fai'vietched.
In other words, it will be s long,
cold winter before Grinneil revises
her system of taking care ot
tootbsli players. some other so»
iiition must be found.

e r e
The answer to that one is
simple. GrLllnell could stop
scheduling schools ngoiust
which it can’t compete tor
ployers, and cord schools with
stendnrds the some us ours,

That would be a tremendous
jolt to the pride and prestige of
ﬁle school. We still can't forget
that in the old days we used to
heat Minnesote, lows, Drake and
Creighton regularly. But we
hsven't heeten Creighton and
Drake for e number of years.
Iowa quit scheduling us more
than a decade ago, and fortunate-
ly for us, we haven't plsyed Mui-

nesottx since they handed us that
14670 beating back in the 19m

century.

in other words, w hnve

three choices. We can start

present course,

The third possibility, and the
one which we must consider seri-
ously is thaL we should swallow
our pride, withdraw from the con-
ference, ond acknowledge that
Coe, Cornell, Iowa State teachers,
central, and Carleton are our nat-
ural rivals, and term a conference
with them. It would he a hard
pill to take. but it would be by
far the wisest course, because the
shock would wear off in a. few
years, and the reputation of the
school would materially benefit
when we won our share of toot-
ball games.

This the proposition sim~
