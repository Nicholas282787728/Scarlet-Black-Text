SEPARATE THE BAND AND PIONEER CHESTl

It is high time for us to recall, if indeed we could
have forgotten, Dr. Steiner's pungent comment on the
first performance at the Grinnell college hand at chapel:
“That's the first time in the history of Grinnell that I've
heard the hand when it didn't sound like a. joke." Thin.
the band‘s ﬁrst exit from the domain of humor should be
practically simultaneous with its disbandment seems to
indicate a lack of appreciation both of the purpose and
of the value of that organization.

The work of the band this yearneeds no eulogy. It
speaks for itself, and the progress made is familiar to
all who have lollowed the activities of the organization
even cssunlly. Purchase of mucheneeded equipment, unl-
forms and music was made. The increase in membere
ship has been remarkable, and the development in mil-
sicianship even mgre conspicuous ins commendable. It
has. been demonétrawd that in the Grinnell hand we

lime a bod, of mu. cizin capable of development into
an organization of distinction.

Now that so auspicio a start has been made it
seems unbelievable that dishaudmelit should take place
for want of funds. It will not take place unless the stile
dciit body ilcs' cs that it shall. Where the support of
opinion is a c and continued, financial backing will
follow. To iinance the blind as a permanent organization.
independent of support [rolll Elle Pioneer clicst is it pros
lcct neither impractical nor impossible.

We need action. The continuance of the band and
its development into a permanent Grinnell organization
are matters for immediate and practical consideration,

.\ SIGNIFICANT SITUATION.

The iluillbcr of new courses added to the college cure
riculuiu for next year is \vortl v of a little added uttenv
tion now that the time '[01' reg -ation is at hand. Next
year will inaugurate many important and significant
changes in the curriculum, as well as additions and one
lnrgemcnts which oifer the student a markedly wider
field ior choice at the time of enrollment.

New courses in applied Christianity, in history. in
education and psychology, in economics and in geology
are among those which have been added. The courses
in art have been re-organized. The department of physi~
cal education for men has ndergone complete reorganiza-
tion which now makes possible a minor in that depart-
ment. A major is offered in the department of speech,
which has been greatly enlarged.

This altered and enlarged curriculum is significant
for two reasons. it indicates that Grinnoll is steadily
progressing, steadily expanding, steadily keeping abreast
of the times; that is its general significance. lts in'r
mediate and practical signiﬁcance is that it ailords Grin—
nell students greater opportunity scholastically and sole
turally-san opportunity which should mean much to those
who have a clear Vision of the fundamental purpose of
college. Whether or not the altered cu iculum affects
you directly and individually, its significance to (him
hell and Grinneli students should not he or 'looked.

.i NMEWORTHY PRODUCTION.

Those who witnessed the successful presentation of
"A Midsummer Night’s Dream" on the south campus
Monday night will recognize therein a noteworthy
achievement. An outdoor production of such magnitude
is manifestly attended with difficulties other than those
imposed by the weather, and that so ambitious an under-
taking was completed both successfully and artistically
is cause [Dr commendation to the departments involved.
Through the Clo-operation of the department of Music, un—
der the direction of Prof. George L. Pierce, the depart»
lnent of Physical Education for Women. under the direc-
tion of lliss Clam J. Andersen and the Experimental
Theatre under the direction of Mr. William Angus, the
presentation a! this famous Shakespearean comedy was
made memorable among artistic productions at Grinnoll.
