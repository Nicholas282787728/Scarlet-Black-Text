Next Season’

IDespite Undefeated Record
Tank Sport May Go

“Unless some unexpected donations
are made, swimming at Grinnell col-
lege will be discontinued next year,"
said John C. Truesdale, director of
athletics in an interview yesterday.

“Even though this year's tank men
.went through the season undefeated
and several of its members will be
returning next year, the team was
not able to meet its expense this
year, and therefore it will be dis-
continued,"
Donations Don't Matcrinlize

“Before the swimming scasonl
lstartcd certain donations were prom-
.iscd to help the financing of the
trips, and to pay the salary of Coach
lElLon Rosen. These donations failed,
‘to materialize when the money was,
asked for, and the college assumed‘
the cost of the salary, but will be
lunahle to do so next year."

The undefeated record of the Grin-
ncll swimming team included victor-
ies over Nebraska and Iowa State,
the leading teams in the Big Six
competition, and some of the timcs-
in la in the races beat long standing
records.

After Mrs. Minnie Allen's talk last
Saturday morning, Katherine Koch,
Grinliell sophomore, went down to
speak with her and was introduced to
a German girl from Amos.

girls face and she replied in the
same language. In a few seconds
they were both talking in German

Schleswig-Helstcui, Germany and
that they had both attended the same
school. The school to which they had
both gone is the Augusta-Victoria-

The two girls didn't have much
time to talk with one another during
