A Pragmatic view of divestment

xOur campus has been unanimous in its
condemnation ol apartheid in South
Ali-ice, Some students. however, have yet
to be convinced of the value of divestment
as n strategy for ending apartheid, While
certain oi these Skeptics are sincerely cons
darned viith the elfects divestment would
have on black viorkers. others are pro
bably just pursuing the sell-serving in-
terests of ”lree market” Republicanism.
it is to those students of the new right that
the following pragmatist arguments for
divestment are addressed.

‘In theearly 1960's both the Democratic
apd Republican parties were at least
nominally committed to winning equal
rights under the law tor black Americans.

or over twenty years. despite the political
and social victories of the Civil Rights

blacks is allowed to exist simply because
there are not enough blaclr voters to lorce

whites by more than iour-toone. Their

ankers as always before. This is quite
probably a false hope. That American
bosiiiess is deluding itsell is not a unique or
original notion. it has been expressed by
the most important members of Black
South African leadership. The late Steven
Bilio. the founder of the South African
Stydents Organization and the Black Come
munity Projects. and a leading iigure in
the Black Consciousness movement, once

Thereiore. Biko stated. any black govern
ment that came to power would have to
enact a type oi socialism which the Black
Consciousness movement reiers to as
Airican Communalism. This philosophy
would involve a change in some basic
aspects or the economic system. including
limited wealth redistribution. Nelson

trial in 1964 the is still serving a lite

big monopolies are owned by one
race only, and without such na-
tionalization racial domination
would be perpetuated despite the

Nelson Mandela and Steven Biko repre-
sent the views of the vast majority or black
South Africans. If we take eventual black
victory as a given. then we must also no
cept nationalization at major industries as
given. It seems pointless. therefore. for
American companies to continue to invest
in South Africa when in all likelihood these
investments will eventually be lost,
Divestment from South Africa will prove
to be a wise financial move for American
companies.

American prolits are not the only thing
put at risk by a continued U S. presence in
S.A. U.S. ioreign policy in southern Airica
has always tailed due to its cooperation

For many oi these metals. the only place
outside of South Africa where they are
found in abundance is the Soviet Union.
The loss of access to these minerals would
be equivalent to the West’s loss of the Per-

very concerned with its image in the eyes
of South African blacks. Right now its im-
age is tarnished at best. Steven Biko
stated:
South Airica is a pawn in the game
at power between the U.S. and the
USSR. Russia has won the show so
tar in southern Airica. The reason of
course is quite simple. The U.S. has
maintained its links with minority
governments. Russia is as imr
perialistic as the U.S. 7 it's just that
their brand of intervention is more
beneficial in Africa . . If we are to

Despite the fact that South African blacks
have no illusions about Soviet motives. the
SovieLs have been more efiective in winn-
ing lriends in SA. because the material
assistance they provide is more valuable
than American “wristslapping.” The
Soviets can also point to the fact that they
have no investments in SA. while the U.S.

it must shift its loyalty from the white
minority to the black organizations 7 and
it must divest.

For the noble spirits who are genuinely
concerned with ending apartheid. but who
fear divestment. we will add a note or two.
