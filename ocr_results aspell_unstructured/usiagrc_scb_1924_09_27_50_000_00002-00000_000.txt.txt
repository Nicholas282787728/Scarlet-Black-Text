There’s something about this ﬁrst
turbulent, hectic Week that "gets" you,
isn’t there? If this is your lirst au—
tumn in Grinnell, there's the wonder.
the delightfully uniolded mystery of
the four years that lie ahead. And it
it’s your fourth, there’s the disquiet-
ing poignancy of the knowledge that
you‘re on the last lap.

You will live in s new age—
nn electrical age. Heavy tasks
will be shifted from human
shoulders to electric motors.
Remember the letters “G-E”.
They are a symbol of service—

For fathers are used to ﬁguring costs.
They’d say: “The electricity for a week’s
washing costs less than a cake of soap.
Human time and strength are too prec-
ious for work which a machine can do so
cheaply and well.”
