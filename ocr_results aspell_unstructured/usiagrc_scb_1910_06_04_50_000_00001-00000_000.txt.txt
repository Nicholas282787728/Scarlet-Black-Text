The college council held the last
meeting at the year Thursday evening.
A number or irirportant matters were
taken up ior discussion and plans made
|ol' their enactment next year.

The auditing committee was advised
to publish a sriliinia oi the accounts
audited once a year. This custom is
in vogue in several oi the larger Uni-
versities and has much to commend it,

s conllrliitee was appointed to inves-
tlgtile'ﬂ'ie question at the cost oi living

sible to ei'iect a reduction in any par-
ticular. This committee is to be com-
posed oi two students and two taculty
member- The student members are
Joseph Watson, '11, and Vera Mont-
gomery, ‘11. The iacnlty representa-
tives will be appointed by the president
oi the college.

Attention uas glvcrl to the desirabih
ity or improving tire standard or schol-
arship among the nirderclassuien. it
was hrot out that it might be at ad-
vantage to emphasize the imopl‘tance
or excellent in this ﬁeld oi work at an
earl, point in the Freshman's college
experience. This matter was recom-
mended to the new council tor early
consideration.

The attention oi the college authorb
ties was called to the iact that a lawn
north oi the library would make the
campus much more attractive than the
present policy at allowing the grass
to grow.

made up at the iollowing members:
The Faculty representatives will be
