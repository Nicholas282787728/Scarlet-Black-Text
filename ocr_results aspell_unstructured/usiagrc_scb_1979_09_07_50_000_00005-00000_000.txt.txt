On stolen drumsqnd security .

by Matthew Reamer

Do you keep valuables at Grinnell?
If so, don't take their security for
granted, Last May, a student’s drum
set, valued at alsoorszooo and weighing
over 200 pounds, was stolen.from
Room 106 of the Fine Arts Building.

James Fudge oi the music depart
ment said that “there have been pro
blems with security from time to time
in Room 106.” Dan Fielding, the vic-
tim of the theft, said that “it seemed
like people were lax” in security at
the time.

Fudge revealed that this was in-
evitable saying, ”There are keys out
because there are student assismnts

he have to use these rooms. Keys
l ave a way of getting around."

in Fielding‘s case, his instruments

are not locked up or in a locker,
However, even if someone had

oose laundry ,still best bet

“Fiftyrcentsl'?! This is an outrage!”
choed through he Loose Hall base-

ent. Accompanying cries of “Jesus,
his Sucks!” and “What a pain in the
SS!” greeted me as [entered the
aundry room.

After two weeks at school I had
rought my dirty, beer be~daubed
eans and a few t-shirts down to wash
0 my surprise and imancial discomr
Irt, I discovered that the cost of a

ash has risen irom a quarter to so
ents, while the cost of ardryer has
one up irom a dime to 25 cents,

According to Vice Provost Ken

owning, the prices on the machines.
him are owned by a private com-
any in town, have stayed the same
.r over a decade. A price increase
as been expected ior the past few
ears,‘but was delayed because Of the

gh cost of changing the machines

cr to take more coins, it was simply
about time" ior a price hike,

Still, 50 cents seemed awfully steep
)me. As i stood looking dumb '
undedly at the washing, machine and
-c 45 cents I held in my »and, someone
iggcsted thal I go to a lamr

ouiat in town when: rue prices are
ieaper and the machines are big-

Determined to beat the system, I
urneyed to the H Br L Enterprises
in70p at Third and State. Union

nately, the prices are not

eaperithey are the same: so cents
a washer and 25 cents for a dryer.

‘ ile the dryers are somewhat larger,

- washing machines are identical to

.se on campus.

managed to break into his locker,
Grinnell offers no insurance coverage
for the personal belongings of anyone
living on campus. Fudge also added,
“BhG will not act“ a police...'l‘he
problem is there are no campus
police." Discipline in this matter is
now up to the users of the facility.

Although theft on such a large scale
may be uncommon at Grinnell, Dean
of Student Affairs James Tederman
said that stereos valued between $400
and $600 and bicycles worth over 3300
have been reported as stolen to his of-
{ice

Tederman said his office would like
to know about thefts to determine the
“kind and pattern of thefts occuring
that might warrant extra security,"
especially ii they are taking place in
one building. “Sometimes a rash of

stealing occurs in one or the halls," he '

were the same, but this laundry did
sport an impressive array oi
paraphernalia, including 27 washing
machines, is heavy duty washers, 12
dryers, detergent vending machines, a
bill changer, and a scale which will
give you your weight and fortune for a
penny—plus your penny back ii you
pick the right slot.

Several signs adorned the walls adver—
tising that “Here, a full thirty minute
wash!“ (As it turns out, the machines
on campus give a full thirtyiour) and
promise that your clothes will be
washed in “rain soft water"
However, I was more interested in my
hard cash than their soft water.

Giving in to the fact that there was
not a cheaper way, I returned to the
Loose basement and fed two quarters
into the washing machine When the
wash was done I was pleasantly sur»

said, but a lot of students don't realize
it. If it is reported to his office,
though, he can help spread the word to
others.

One problem is that “students are
lulled into a feeling oi complacency,"
said Tederman, remarking'that “99%
of the cases of theft occur in unlocked
rooms." it is surprising, he said how
many thefts occur in the ten to twenty
minutes while students are gone from
their rooms, There have been some
problems with young teenagers from
town being “caught in residence halls,
but students don‘t tell the kids they
don’t belong...They (the teenagers)
have a free run of the place." Teder-
man strongly advises students to ques-
tion people on their floor or in their
dorm who don’t seem to be Grinnell
students.

prised mat for my 25 cents, I received
45 minutes of dryer time, as opposed

to the 30 minutes my same quarter
would have gotten on the larger
machines in town But it still took two
quarters to get my jeans dry.

Four new washers and dryers have
been inshalled in the basement of Main
Hall. Many of the other machines on
campus (those in Loose, Younker,
and Dibble) have been rebuilt, This
gives students convenient access to four
laundries, and with no real justifica~
tion for using the alternatives in town,
it looks like the campus facilities are
the most logical choice, even with the
recent price hike.

“Besides,” a colleague in laundry oi
mine was quick to point out, “when
you do your wash here, you get to go
up and party with your friends during
the rinse cycle!"

Proximity and profit

by WmSlon Klsuler

No freshmen and a sophomore

transfer student, presently living in a
double in South Younker’s pit, have ,

discovered a way to make extra
money. Quite simply, Jordon Kovitz,
Barry Jarret, and Robert Barry are
selling money for profit.

Living across from the laundry

room, these men were inundated with

requests to make change. Never
opposed to making a quick buck,
they proposed to sell one—[or $1.10.
However, they realized that they

would need oiiicial college approval to

initiate such a business, so a written

request was made.

“Your prices seem reasonable, and
you're offering a service some
students may need,” wrote back Dean
of Student Affairs Jim Tederman. “Go
ahead with your proposal if you wish.”

Elated, the three posted adverr
tisements and loaded up on quarters
and dimes.

“Although business is slow," come
merited Kovitz, the founder of the
business, “we expect it to pick up
when the weather gets cold and the
trip to the Bookstore for ‘frec' change
becomes a hassle." I’-
