Student writes epitaph
after four years at Grinnell

Dear Editor.

Just. as Mr. Poland. I feel lensmn (albeit
4 years worth) stemming from the moral
inconSISLencies I see In others 7 “isolated
evcnts" which perhaps should not occur
among an educated concerned student
body. However. 1 cannot agree with
Poland's self-righteous stand that those
students involved In his pet peeve: are the
“undereducated” and that he. as a senior,
represents the educated sage — a
laullless. ﬁnished standard 710 Wthh we
might all aspire It IS amazing that over
night. we seniors change from ‘liberals' to
threatened reactionarles

As a senior. I would like to cnnlront one
“traditional" aspect of the Grinnell EX-
pcricnce whtch 1 hopc does not continue,
Not as one more proof that the sky is fall»
mg. but as a hope {or change.

Last Tuesday it happened again

I found a young beagle standing in 10th
Ave.. as cars honked. braked. and swerved
to avoid, hitting the oblivious beast, In
recognizing the pup. several passersby
directed me to the owner’s home. adding
“yeah. she’s always iollowing people
around and getting last . . . they don’t take
very good care oI ii.."r

The anger I felt. was the culmination of
so many past Incidents: students. self-
proclaimed “animal lovers." bringing
home that cute puppy or kitten without
cansidering the fifteen year commitment
of responsibility it entails. Students take
on pets arllully overlooking the time.
money, training. and patience that they re»
quire and the student's own transient
situation and busy schedule. These
students are not just infringing an my en»
joymenl. they are destroying lives. When
break comes. the animal gets worms or
messes in the house. the money runs out.
at the maids and/or landlords discover the
illegal resident. what happens? Abandon-
ment? Yes. Tied constantly outdoors? Yes.
shuffling the pet Into a sequence oI un-
suitable hames'! Yes. When the pet gets
lost. the owner just “doesn't find the time"
in his or her busy schedule to relocate the

lost “friend 7 Yes all of these all [no Ire»
qucntly.

These l“cl;u-.[s reflect national trends
lthe average pet is owned lor two years by
one family). yet as Mr. Poland laments ior
his albums. how can it happen here in our
haven? Because neither a BA. nor the
Grinncll Experience represents an end to
our learning. especially in “earthly" and
moral matters We all make mistakes. we
are all ignorant. Mr, Poland. but we all
have room to learn more.

For those at you yet with time here. you
huve a chance to atone tor the sins cl your
undereduc’dled. ignorant Grinnell up-
perclassmen and alumnae Do not con-
sider living off-campus as the invitation to
bring In a pet, Realize the young animal
you bring in today will be with you until
you are thirty-five years old. Remember
that the animal will require MONEY:
shots. food. medical allentnion. TRAIN-
ING: understanding its mistakes. patient
correction and MUCH TIME AND AT-
TENTION. much more than you can'im-
agine. Do not take on a pct as a “group pror
ject" unless it is understood that one in-
dividual will ultimately assume respon
sibility when break and linals roll around.
Consider your present (inevitably busy)
schedule and plans [or the next years. Can
you really alter a stable. loving home? Do
you really have the time? You must see
past the “cuteness" of the animal to see
the struggle for lile it represents in the
face of staggering national odds which say
it will die. If you truly “love” animals.
Volunteer at the Newton Animal Rescue
League or work [or change in our system.

This is the epitaph that 1, a December
graduate. ask to have inscribed on the
monument that represents my four years
here. If the animal situation is any Indica-
tion. I certainly hope that the Grinnell
campus will change. (My apologies to the
people who have been irreproachable pet
owners (of which there are manyl who I
hope will understand their slight in my
need to make a needed point.) — Sarah

Students to conduct ARH survey

. Dear Editor.

As part of the renovation of ARH. the
auditorium will be removed from the se-
com! and third floors of ARH. The student
body will be left without a large theatre in
which to view movies when this happens.
Another problem facing the student body
is the lack of an adequate facility Iar con-
certs and parties. To advise the ad
ministration on how best to address these
student needs. the SGA formed a commit»
tee oI seven students to research possible
solutions and then make a recommendar
tion to SGA and the Board of Trustees as to
the need for, and the function and location
of a new student center on campus.

As part or this process the committee
has prepared two surveys: the ﬁts! covers
the kind ol social programming the stu-
dent body wants. and the second covers
student reaction to some possible sites for
the new building. The surveys are now up
on the AVAX computer system and will be
there until Sunday. December 14. The
surveys can be accessed by typing “poll
places" for the survey on sites. or ”poll
parties" tor the survey on programming.
Each survey will only take a few minutes
of your time and the data is necessary for
the committee [0 belter present its case to

the Trustees.

There will be an all Campus meeting at
the beginning of second semester to share
the recommendations with the Student
body before the report is presented to Joint
Board. Please take a few minutes of your
time to help us with the project which is
very important to the luture social life bl
