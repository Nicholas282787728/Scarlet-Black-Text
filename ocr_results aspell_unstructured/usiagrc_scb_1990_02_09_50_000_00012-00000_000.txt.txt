Learning Without Stress

By Jennifer Manes

Some people enjoy
converting grayish lumps of
soggy clay into symmetrical
Vases. A lot of people delight in
taking tightly focused shots of
grass blades. And many
anistically inclined people weave
frequently.

Because students want to
learn the aforementioned crafts,
Grinnell College accordingly
furnishes them with the Craft
Workshop, It offers non-credit
evening and weekend classes to
those who can come up with the
lab fees.

Kim Upton, Resident
Advisor of Norris Hall, is the
director of the Craft Workshop.
She is responsible for hiring the
instructors, who are paid studean
that specialize in a particular
craft. She also participates in the
Workshop herself. When I spoke
with her she was industriously
throwing clay on a pottery wheel,
which she learned from the
pottery class last year. This
semester she is taking the
weaving class. “You become
addicted to your craft," she
commented.

The classes are held in the
basement of Darby Gym. The
pottery class meets there from
7:00 to 9:00 Monday and
Wednesday evenings beneath the
Nike—generated squeaking of
basketball practice The pottery
students explained the basic

techniques of hand building and
slabbing, They fling lumps of
clay at tables to get rid of air
bubbles, (to avoid having the
pottery burst when it bakes in the
kiln). The explosive thwacks of
soft Wet clay meeting table are
frequent

Most students had the usual
previous tltird grade encounters
with clay, and wanted more
experience with pottery.
Freshman Amy Fort hesitantly
claims prior experience from
family organized craft cxhibits.
But that was a long time ago, and
now she concentrates on “really
simple objects," and just has fun
with the class.

So does Dave Clark, RA of
James and Haines. He benefits
greatly from the class. “I have
no idea, It's gonna be something
when it‘s done," he said regarding
his meticulous efforts with
smooth clay slabs. Clark’s
project later tumed out to be a
chopstick holdert He likes
Chinese food.

The atmosphere of the pottery
class is pleasant and relaxed
“It’s, like, losing its idea." said
one student while struggling with
a mass of layered coils. “It’s
frustrating as hell," chimed in
another.

One of the photography
classes is held next door. Last
Monday. a handful of students sat
around a table practicing inserting
camera film into developing
reels.

Senior Mark Saint Andre has
had prior experience with
photography, but is taking the
class for a greater familiarity with
the developing and darkroom
process. He and other students
advocated the cheap cost of doing
their own developing, compared
to the price of having it done
professionally.

Almost all students stressed
the therapeutic value of the
Workshop. Junior Normandie
Madden, who teaches the
photography classes, said, “I can
spend all day Saturday in here. I
really love it. It's what sports
are like for a lot of people” She
is interested in teaching
photography professionally in the
future.

The Workshop is easily
accessible to students It has
open studio hours, during which
time photography and pottery
monitors are available to assist
people with their projects.
Madden stressed that she wouldn’t
be able to get by without the
help of Chris Mullarkey and
Kevin Doerschug, who are the
photography monitors for her
classes. Additionally, whenever
the Forum desk is open, students
may check out a key there for
Darby basement when it is
locked.

In April, Workshop students
may display their favorite
creations in the Terrace Gallery of
the Forum in the Craft Workshop
exhibit.

Mesquakie Artisans Exhibit Tradition and Change}

 

By Brett Fechheimer

The exhib' on entitled
“Mcsquakie Artisans: Tradition
and Change” is now on display at
the Community Center in
downtown Grinnell. The show
incorporates artistic creations by
various residents of the Tama
County Native American
Settlement.

It is likely that many
Grinnellians don't realize that
there is a Native American
settlcment located in Tama
County some 25 miles northeast
of the college. The settlement
covers almost 4000 acres, and
houses approximately 1000
members 01' inc Mesquakie tribe.

While viewing this
exhibition, one is immediately
impressed with the abundance of
bright COIOI’S"/|bl’£lnl pinks,

art exhibit at the Grinnell Community Center.

fascinating integration of
mainstream American products
with the otherwise traditional
artifacts. For instance, a “jingle
dress” created by Mary Youngbcar
seems, from afar, purely

Mesquakic. On closer
inspection, however, one can see
that thcjingles sewn to the dress‘
front are actually rolled lids from
this of Copenhagen tobacco.
“Tradition and Change" is an

apt title for this exhibition. The
Viewer will find not only
anscetral-looking spoons, carved
from box elder wood, but also a
series of sharp collages, by Ray
Youngbear, which combine
photographs, pages from an old
diary, and fantastic color symbols
to bring to life a sense of
personal and tribal history.

The viewer of this show must
keep in mind that the most
precious components of
Mesquakic art is not available to
outsiders. Karin Connelly, a
writing lab assistant at Grinnell
College, and organizer of the
exhibition, reports that she had to
go door-to-door at the settlement
in order to accumulate a sufﬁcicnt
number of works. Artifacts that
are most meaningful to the
Mcsquakies are, understandably
absent from this exhibition,

The skill, care and diversity
evident in these works is
indisputably remarkable. I was
impressed with the quality of
several of the black»and-white

photographs taken by tho
settlement‘s children, as well as
the stirring, somewhat
surrealistic oil painting by,
Marcellus Mitchell entitled
“Mesquakie Dancets", *

An audio tape of traditional
Mesquakie songs is available to
accompany your viewing of the
show. it provides a fitting
background in which to View this‘
exhibit so replete with heritage
and pride.

You have until Feb. 16 to
judge for yourself how the
enduring Mcsquakie tradition;
have manifested themselves in
contemporary art and artifacts.
The exhibition is open fof
viewing on the second floor 0;
the Grinnell Community Center,
4th and Park Streets, woektiaye
from noon to 4 pm, or by
appointment. ldefiniicly‘
recommend this exhibition,
especially for those who bemoan

the supposed homogeneity of
Iowa's culture and populace. t
