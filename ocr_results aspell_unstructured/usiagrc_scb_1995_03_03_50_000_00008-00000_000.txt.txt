S83 REVIEW

 

M0j0 Machine
well—received
at State Street

By ANDY HICKEN

Arts Columnist

IO Machine does not
profess to be anything
otherthanastraight-out

blues band. All of the group‘s
songs follow the tried-and-true 127
bar blues progression. Blues stan-
dardsandstandard-soundingsongs
serve as a platform for the soloing
otguitanstsBrianMundyandCraig
Metz and harmonicarplztyer Alan
Hanley.

That being said, Mojo Ma-
chine is very, very good at what it
does, The reaction ofthe crowd to
their show at State Street Station
last Saturday could probably best
be described as one ofworshipful
amazement, Maybe it had some-
thing to do with the alcohol, the
more relaxed venue. or some
wann—weatherrinduced rise in hor-
mone levels, but the bar patrons'
Mojo was rising that night—and
Moja Machine did not disappoint.
Thebandplayedanastoundingthree
sets (of which I caught the last two)
over the span of four hours.

Backed by the solid rhythm
sectioniofdrummerJo Sutton and
bassist Chris Sutcliff, Mundy,
Metz and Hanley wrapped their
solos expenly around Sutcliffand
Hanley’s vocals—or perhaps it
would be more accurate to say that
Sutcliff and Hanley occasionally
added vocals to the solotng. Timer
wise, probably 90% of Mojo
Machine‘s music concentrates on
solo improvisation,

Metz’s adept, technical solos
contrasted nicely withMundy’stcxe
tured, emotional (and also adept)
work. Atleastone patron was heard
to say “Brian Mundy is a god,"

Finally, Hanley‘s harp added a
dynamic to the band that took it a
step even further above the ordinary
bassguitandrums drudgery we're
often faced wtth.

Overall. Moja Mac/title Zr root
blues worked perfectly in the beer—
drenched environment of State
Streelithat's a compliment, not
criticism—which bodes well for
their upcoming headlining set at the
Terrace Lodge in Newton on St,
Patrick's Day. March 17 (cover
charge will be two dollars),

 

 

 

Surrealistic

By ELIZABETH MACKEY
Staff Writer

HEN asked his reason for
choosingthe play Foren-
ri'c and the Navigatorx,

student director Jim Kropa replied.
“because it has the best of every-
thing, It has guns. It has sex. It has
an outer space scene, and it’s got
what I consider a tragic ending. And
its all condensed into forty minutes,"

The Open Space Production Fo-
t-etiric and the Navigators will ups
pear at 8:00 pm. tonight and tomor—
row night at Bob’s, That means you
can go see this play and still be able
to make it to the Tracy Chapman
concert or the Poncho Sanchez band.

The play is written by Sam
Shepard, the same man who wrote
the recently produced True Weri.
However, Forensic and the Naviga-
torr was written twenty years before
last week’s play.

“I‘d wanted to do this play last
semester before I knew [about Tm:
Went,“ said Kropa, a senior at
Grinnell.

‘Thisplaytsalotmorebizarrezis
far as the characters go," added actor
Andy Kropa. “It's kind of absurdist
too. Like, my character and my part-
ners’iwe carry ray guns, But it has a
lot ofsimilarttjes to True West.., One
common theme the two plays have is
one character becoming another, All

play premieres tonight at Bob’s

the characters go through drastic
changes in their lives," he said

“By doing ital Bob‘s we hope
to replicate what an actual original
performance ofthis thing might have
been like commented Kropa

The costumes and the sound
sliouldalsobeinteresting.“We‘vegonc
to the Junkyard and the second hand
store and shopped and ti-icdio ﬁnd a lot
of parts that would turn into really
funky surreal kind of costumes be

cause Jim wanted the play to be surreal,"
said junior Zander Cannon, who drew
the posters and designed the costumes,
There are no reservations, there is
no entrance fee, and doors open at 7:30

“Themostintcrestingthingabout

ﬁgures. The Mnrlhniodesign was an
experiment to see the visual impact
of the box itself.

“I considered putting something
like Grimtell College instead of
Mat'lburo,"commentedWileox,“but
I didn’t go that far,"

“Part ofwhat was exciting about
havtng it up at Bob's was that people
would goandlookat it andtalk about
it. ThzttwasprettyCool."satdWilCox,
“A couple of times I‘ve been sitting
in Bob's, and people will stttliereztnd

talk about my anwork. Ive never
really pointed it out. because I enjoy
just watching people talk about it. At
othcrtimcs. people have said, ‘By the
way, Evan's sitting right here and he
did these.’ I've talked to a couple or
peoplethatway. Its kind offascinating
to hear what people actually think about
it. That’s something you don’t get
even ityou have your stutrup in Fine
Arts," he said.

The pieces were generated last
semester in McKtbbtti’s intermediate
painting course. Wilcox foundthat he
prefers painting to printmaking and
ceramics because it “is more sponlar
neous." He also liked that paint al-
lowed him to experiment with Van
ables of size and color.

Wilcox prefers not to specify the
meaning of his artwork. “It’s a hard
thing to say. Iwouldn’t want to give
away too much; I'd rather let the work
stand on its own. Most of it you can
interpret which ever way you want,"
he said.
