in Russian 'Hcl‘ enthusiasm for hei‘
work is wonderful, and the sacriﬁces
which she has made for it are almost
unlimited. It is said that her return to
Petrugrad following the abdication of
the Czar and her consequent release
was a triumph Which has never been
surpassed. Evenrwhere the peasants

PICK YOUR CLASS!

Have you s purpose in coming to
college? Are you here because you
made up your mind that it ms the
best thing to do or are ‘you here be-
uiinse you made up your mind that it
was the easiest and most natural
thing to do?

We hays heaid three opinions of
why studenm come' to college advanc-
on during the last few days. First that
it is a good economic move‘ and that the
future college man or woman realizes
that a college education increases

oue's earning capacity far beyond the"

mount of money which it is possible
to earn during the four years spent in
college. Second, a dcsir-e to broaden
the mind, by gaming 3. working know-
ledge of the laws of the world and of
society and thus make yourself a more
useful member of society. Third. that
o grcat deal more fun can be had dur-
ing the college course, then by going
to work hftcrgr-aduatins from high
school

Which class Are you in? Or dout’
you reclly know? If you don't, you
are probably in the last class. If you
die in the last class get out of it and
get a worthwhile purpose. Line up
with either of the ﬁrst two or combine,
make I. class of your own and help
both yourself and your associates.
