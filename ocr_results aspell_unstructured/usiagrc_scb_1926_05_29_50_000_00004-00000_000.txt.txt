Class Play IS First
Amateur Production
0f “Cyrano” In West

(Continued From. Yuze One)

is essentially :i play of \uutll. It has
all the glamour, the yitalrty, the brave
urn of men young, enough to light and
dream, or a woman “whose smile
a perfect thing." To tile play the
young actors have brought their hel is
and ready hands, What they have
lacked in ‘pel‘lehce they have made
up for i th enthusiasm and the ins
tensit With which they entered into
their roles.

No doubt there are those who are
skeptical regarding the iii-st amateur
production of "Cyrano" in the Middle
West. There were those who gasped
when they heard that college students
were to essay “Romeo and Juliet." Yet
these same skeptics remained to ad-
inire and approve when the curtain
fell on Shakespeare‘s tragedy of
youth, There is every reason for be-
lieviag that "Cyrano de Bergernc" will
meet with equal approbation.
“Cyrano" Is Thrilling

To the spectators, one word. You
may expect to find "Cyrano" thrilling
ly theatrical, dazzling. It is not a play
for sane judgment or customary crit-
icnl yardstielrs. Halt the ion is in its
breathless pace, furious action, in its
sheer bravado. Cyrano is D'Artigan,
Abelsrd, Byroniall in one. He is the
man of action, the poet, the lover.
with his gigantic nose, his thunderous
voice, his facile sword he defies all en-
emies. He is the Gascon, clever,
quick. courageous. But it is the soul
of Cyrano, that soul to which Rosthnd

In any lulls where the cast lacks
other entertainment, George Moore
valiantly comes to ’the rescue with
special exhibitions ot Azetc dancing,
to the delectation of the cl'a\vd,7 that
is, so it is said. Undoubtedly the
preps who are endowed with the parts I

the supreme wallop out of occupying
the stage in this famous production.
And as the crowning event of all, the
cast is being promoted to performance
on a real stage in a real theatre, for
rehearsals at the Colonial are to begin

Dorms Entertain for

The dormitories are busily enter-
taining for Jimmy Lightﬁngers and
the festivities will last until after

homeward.

Although Ligbtﬁngers has paid seVA
eT’dl second story visits to lthe dormi-
tories the past year his stay has not
beensso extended or so hilarious on
his previous visits as it is on this one.

The ﬁrst party of his present visit
was staged for him in Dibble and a
right smart party it was but it was
like Smarty Smarty's and no
one came except the guest of honor
and even the host was absent. Jimmy
had a hot time and helped himself
right royally to everything he saw,
even taking the coin or the realm.
Lightﬁhgers showed that he Was a
gentleman of the blood royal by the
fact that he disdained to take the last
cent and left his entertainers a nest
egg.

Several little tea dances were slung
hy the dormites along the line but the
cough drop boys started to entertain
this famous personage and are giving
him a right joll’y time. At his ﬁrst
party Jimmy showed his dexterity by
gently removing a typewriter without
his host becoming aware of the 1055
