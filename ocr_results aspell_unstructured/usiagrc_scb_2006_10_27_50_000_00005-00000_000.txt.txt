Horror at Harris for Halloween weekend

Saw (1994)
tttﬁﬁ

Gruesome violence and
psychological questions ;

Simply put, 1 horror inovre is good
if its scary. Thus, when reviewing 1
slnsher flick, I first 1sk myself: did this
film ue1ily mnkc me 1) cmp my p1nts,
b) lt1ve swcnry polms rind/or c) jump
to an extent that crnasculatcd me in
front of my date? Sil’w, directed by
J1mes win, is 1n unflinching medita~
tiou’on human motivation that utilizes
the anytl‘iingrgocs nature ot‘ horror to
explore the curiosities of the psyche.
Though refreshing in its genrerdcﬁ'lng
1rrcmpr to be interesting, s11; perhnps
focuscs too much on Its clever message,
11d not enough on . wcll, ncccss'rtnr—
ing a change ofpants.

The arm begins with two men wake
ing up on opposite sides of1 dank 1nd
dilapidated bathroom, both chained to
a pipe such that they cannot quite reach
the man lying between them in a pool
of blood. one of them, 1 surgeon by
the mate of Lawrence Gordon (Cary
Elites), discovers 1 r1pe in his pocket
informing him that unless he kills the
other 1111, Adam (screenwriter Leigh
Whannell) by six o’clock, he will be left
“to rot.“ They have been abducted by
the infamous Jigsaw Killer, who puts
his Victims into grisly situations that
force them to brutally harm themselves
or others in order to survive. Our vil-
lain is a sort of macabre crusader, who
believes that in experiencing extreme
mental and physical 1gony, his victims
will come to appreciate life more. Oh,
and he also provided Adam and LawV
rence each with a rusty hacksaw that
cuts through ﬂesh, but not chains. You
get the picture.

This premise is quite the doozy.
In Sam, unlike most horror films, it's
the good guys who perform the acts
of hellish violence. Furthermore, the
bad guy ain't so bad; in f1ct, one of his
surviving victims claims that theJigsaw
Killer’s fiendish schcmc actually hclped
her. This raises a disturbing question:
can we only come to truly apptecr—
are life through the most monstrous
of struggles? This question, though
thought—provoking, can’t bring Saw to
life. Although Whannell and Elwes are

given long scenes in which to convinc-

ingly portruy the grim process of corn
\crting dcspcliltion into ruthlessness,
they \vithcl in the limelight, undone by
1 combmoticn or their silly bickering
nutl harnrny wailing.

There‘s room for characterization
in 1 horror film. Too much ofit, how—
cvcr, bogs everything down in the very
unrscal'y rcnliryctthc tinniliir, vcn so,
Saw, with its intrinsically creepy prcrnr
ise, exeinng itcrion sequences 1nd mgr
gcd visuuls, is worth 1 viewing. Call me
sadistic 11d jaded, but 1s Grinnelli1ns
on the first Friday back from br'cak,
don’t we deserve to watch somconc clsc
stiffer?

The Wolf Man (194.11)-
tittﬁgl
No big surprises, . 7
fun horror classic ‘ ,
T/zc mount is the gr1udd1ddy of

all werewolf movies. Although it his.

zarlcly shows no full moon, it features
pretty much everything else that we
now associate with werewolves. Ad-
verse reaction to silver? Chock. Halfr
man/half—wolf appearance? Check!
Inexplicable attraction to hot blondes
and hot blondcs only? Big check! We’re
t1lking the gr1ndd1ddy ofa'll werewolf
movies here.

Tl): WuyMrm does what every good
horror movie should do: build up the
tension to an almost unbearable point.
Everybody knows who the title ch11
acter is, and it's not difficult to figure
out What he's going to become. Hence,
the bcoury ofrhis film is in the waiting.
Waiting for Larry (Lon Chaney) to
get bitten, waiting for Larry to ﬁnally
transform, waiting tor the girl (Evelyn
Ankers) to get involved by blundcring
rn.

if you've ever seen 1 werewolf

'mcvic, you'll know how this one goes.

Decent guy returns to his father’s
castle (of [Ulli'It’ there's a castle!) and
meets a beautiful] woman. One fateful
night, decent guy 1nd girl 11: walking
through inexplicably foggy forest (of
tours: there‘s a foggy forestl). Girl gets
1tr1clted by wolf, guy comes to rescue,
guy gets bitten, guy gets hairy, goes on
rampage, and tries to kill girl, guy gets
killed by sticks (of mum it's a cliched
plot!). Nothing surprising here, but,
hey, it's only an hour long.

Baum-s the 1111/1111!

Since the movie was filmed In 1941,
the special effects aren't going to dazzle
you, not will the set. Larry's transition
[0 werewolf consists of small film clips
of his feet getting progressively more
1nd more covered in fur (actually yik
hair). The sets 1rc notieeobly enclosed,
especially in the woods areas.

But the sheer tension of the movie,
the conflict evident in Larry's free in
dealing with his unstopp1ble curse,
mnkes up well for the simple cinemn-
tography.1fyou like horror movies, this
one is well worth the investment.

nint, moves into 1 new 1pm-tment with
her loving ltusb1nd, Guy (John CasV
savetes). The neighbors initially seem
nice if nosy, but begin to exert 1 d1rk
influence on Guy.

This influence manifests itself
as date mpe with a spiked chocolate
mousse.The event, the most psycholog-
ically horrifying moment ofthc movie,
is quickly brushed aside. Despite Guy’s
admission of guilt, the film glosses over
the act. Rosemary becomes pregnant,
but becomes to look more Like she's dy»
ing than with child. Rosemary becomes
more and more paranoid 1s she begins
to believe that her neighbors and then
her husband want to sacrifice her baby
in an occult ritual.

Even with on this potential, the
movie stumbles along before ﬁnally
landing on its 1ss.The movie is not gory,
which could have been 1 nice change
from modern horror movies, but it also
l1eks psychological horror. It ends up
just being boring. Anything even re-
mctely interesting is quickly dismissed
or ignored 1s ifinconscqucntial.

The cryptic note is never explained,
and going back after watching the
movie sheds no light as to us me1ning.
