Out Of Order

Although last Saturday’s Student Council convention
(‘iffel‘ed from those of previous years in several Ways, its
inilure to produce two nominees has raised questions about
tie value of holding conventions in the future.

Most of the activity on tlle convention floor was clealu

if an attempt to stall until tlle arbitrary deadline, and thus
. me a. primary election by the entire student body.'

One-half of the tinle allotted for the convention was
taken up with nominations (mostly of ”jag” candidates)
and demonstrations (on such matters of importance as ash
trays). This and part of the balloting activity seemed to
be no d on for the express purpose of flauntillg the "
deadline ruling. Some maintain that, had there been time
.for both jag-gory and serious balloting, both would have
leen successful. Bllt, the jaggel-y didn't fulfill its function
(f entertainment. The purpose for which it was used gives
rise to strong suspicions that students are not responsible
enough to carry on a convention '

A reason given by some halls which stalled during the
ialloting was that the delegates were unsure of the real
\rishes of the students, and felt the student body should
make its own choice. If it is true that the delegates don‘t
their the opinions of those they are representingy'then
t‘lere ls no justification for a Student Council convention.
Ie haps one reason for this uncertainty was pressured, last-
l inute blocking ill the halls at a time when a majority
I'adn'r decided whom they wished to support.

A more obvious reason for the stallingithat the sup~
lortel's of the candidates were not satisfied to have the
convention choose nominees, and thus manipulated it for
“their own purposes—doubtless entered the picture to some
extent. If it is possible for certain groups to sway conven—
" ns for their own ends, conventions are not onll‘ under
er 'able. but dangerous. .

Reactions to Saturdays convention indicate that en-
tertainment without nomination is not a sufficient purpose
{or holding future conventions.’ Unless the strident body
feels it can find enjoyment ill serious ballotilw it will be-

come difficult to find reasons for holding future conven~

If you have been wondering- what happened to last

lesday’s straw vote, ask the people who tool: the ballots

from the bookstore. Evidently someone was afraid of Stile
dent opinion.

The Student Council 'convc’n-

body and to nominate two can-
didates for the cﬂlcc‘ of. sc

Last ycar it barely succeeded
in the ﬁrst purpose, 'and this
year it failed in both: There
Can be little doubt: that it will

I left the convention at
eight o'clock, when nuenunncc

and a couple of dogs The fill-
lowiug material in allows was
written late Saturday nighl by
one delegate who was (as you
will see) pretty disgusted with
the whole thing: ,

“It is unnecessary to say that
the Convention left u bad taste
in everyone‘s mouth. The exact
reasons for its abortive result
are not quite as evident, how-
evel‘r One candidntc had the
necessary number-oi votes for
nomination but was kept from
this by the olhcr two serious
candidates (which was under-
standable) and'by the screallcd
”jugs” (which was not).

“There is something my
frustrating in watching a group
of self-appointed guardians of
good times going through ilich-
nauseous speeches and petty
motions.

“Tllisris' not in say that I
would he opposed to horse-
plny at the convention. Funny
speeches, clever demonstra-
lions and signs, and a reason—
able amount of parliamentary
delay are certainly a pm of
lhc proceedings. But .to have
to watch an endless pnrnae of
egotistical nttentiml-galllerers
rendering boring speeches is
beyond nnyone's endurance.

"And whcn one dclcgalc. in
a lastrdllch elicn to delay.
amuse and be cute. resorts to
a forng withdrawal statement,
I feel llkc resigning from lhc

“When a leader pi e promi—

proclaims lls "ll‘adltion" of nev-
er having voted for a sol'lous
candidate, it shows that lhc in-
stilullon ct llic sc convenlion

To the Editor:

l'vc bccn pleased in see you
announce lecturers in lhc sc-
ries “This ’Is My Faith‘." ll'is
news to have lcarucd
born in Japan and

visilors
in India
of
lh'cir cullurc's. I don't lhink this
has been done before in our
culture. During March we are
to hear representatives of Mos-
lein'Egypl. and Confucian China.

Even in -our own culture, to
ha e.cqual place given to ’a

Jewish rabbi, a Calhoun priest'

and ii Protestant minister was

ruled out for centuries except

among the very sophisticated.

Thcr‘c' is really more news
llere' than merely to announce
their coming, 0-" reactions
are at least as important. I
shall not put it primarily on
vlhe basis that our country is
now a world power. We may
succeed or ml in our msks
dependent on our relations to
peoples who lhink quite dil-
icrcnlly lrom us.

One recent visilc‘r, Dr, Joseph
Kllagmva, was a bit skeptical
of the value of listening to
seven men who ncvcr get a
chance to meet and Cl‘lthlZe
cich otllor’s teachings. He
thought it the job oi some
agency on campus not to allow
us lo consider one pel~~pecln~c
after another, which will issue
in no reconsideration of our
basic propositions about various
ways of life, basic views 'ci
God and of man in the uni~
verse. ‘

Grinnell sluucnls nrc terri-
bly heed/Why not give them
columns to illtérpret, to rebuke

indeed the case."

Indeed it is. There is talk
of discontinuing the conven-
(ion. But then than has been
a lot of talk over this past
week. Some of it has been
campaign talk—argument and
debate—and some or it has
taken the {arm oi small. mn-
licinus and completely n...
founded rumor. This lnst‘
would not be so lrighlenlng~
if it weren't evident that some
of our more intelligent people
are being laken in by it.

Before you vote next Monday.
please‘ in 8‘ into account what
the CANDIDATE has said, not
whal someone else has said
ABOUT lhc candidate.

And bear in mind that this
next year can bc cl big one for
shideul governmcm. in spite at
what the cynics say. n will
make a grc-il dcnl of dincmucc
who is at the head of it.
