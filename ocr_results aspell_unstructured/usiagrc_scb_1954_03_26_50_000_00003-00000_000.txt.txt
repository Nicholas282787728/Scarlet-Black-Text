Dibble, Cowles Each Clailll First
In Disputed IM Swimming Meet

The men‘s intramural swim-
ming meet held last Monday and
Tuesday was unofficially won by
Dibble hall, with Cowles a
close second. However cowles
protested the score and a deci-
sion sroin the intramural board
was expected today.

The disputed event was the
160 yd. freestyle relay, which
came near the end of the meet.
The referee ruled that a Cowles
mail swam out of his lane and'
bumped another swimmer, thus;
disqualifying Cowles from the;
event.

This was the crucial event in
the meet because a third place
finish or better would have give
en Cowles the meet, As it was,
Dibble took first in the relay
and toppedl Cowles in total
points 26 to 24. other scores:
south Younker 14; north Yatunks

the meet was Dave Dietitian of
south Younker who won the 100
yd. freestyle and tied for first
in the 40 yd. backshoke with
Phil Sherman of Clark.

Other winners were Dick
Booth of Dibble in the 40 yd.
breaststroke; John T lho'rn a,

Cowles, and Dave Norris, Dibble, l

tie for first in the 4D yd. freer
style; and Chuck McKay, Cowles,
diving. Dibble won both relays.

to Coach Bob Peterson's woes.
his star performer of last year,
Hap Miller, has decided not to
return to school after spring
vacation. A5 a sophomore Miller-
came in fourth in the confer
, nce meet last year and was
chterson's top man all season.
