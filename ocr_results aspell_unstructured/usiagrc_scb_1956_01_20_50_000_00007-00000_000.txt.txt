teams met in
Carlton's menagel‘lesllke gym-
nasium. Grinnell still reeling
from the loss to St, Olaf the
night before couldn't match
what has proved to be Carlo
tonls best effort. Since that
game Carleton has been about
as successful as Grinncll as
they have dropped successive
games to Coe, Cornell and their
ci-osstown rival, St. Olaf.

Coach Pfitsch has been drill-
ing his charges hard all week
with the emphasis on rebounds
ing and outshocting. Both of
these aspects are showing im-
provement as the cagers seem
to realize that this is a must
game.

As far as his outlook for the ,

Savage feels that “with the

What was his biggest thrill in .
