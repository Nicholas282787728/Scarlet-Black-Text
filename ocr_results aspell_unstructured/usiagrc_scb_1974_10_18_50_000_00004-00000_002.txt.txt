Safley: Price confuses philosophy

To the Editors:

1 was very distressed by Ted
Price's article printed in the 00*
tober 11 edition of the $811} and
would appreciate your printing my
“liberal Criticism" of his article. In
my opinion Mr. Price has done 2i
iirst class job oi misrepresenting
the liberal philosophy and in such a
way as is rather insulting to me as
a self conlcsscd liberal.

First of all the definition Mr.
Price gave or ”pure liberal
thought” could not, in my opinion.
be further from the lruth. Liberal
thought is not a tolerance oi other
Views. If one is to fix a definition to
liberal lhoiight it might be better
described as an iiitoierance to any
action that would inhibit any iii-
dividuals right to think feel and act
in a tree and ineblrusive way. Such
a view is born out DI a sitliatirln
where the leelings oi a group or
people are suppressed by those
who control our society, Liberal
thought is aimt-tl at ”making the
world a better placc", but not by
uniting all the people under "one
single outlook" or "one will" In
my opinion such a view is more
conservative than it is liberal The
idea of lihei'allty as I see it. is not to
“ ing the interests of the in-
di dual into harmony with the
interests of the college" but to
allow the interests oi the people to
become the interests of [hair
society and government

. ’ricc must understand that
in dea ing with a topic such as this
we are dealing in generalities We
cannot actually bring the interests

oi all people together to term one
general interest because of cone
tradicting opinions However, by
allowing the expression oi all
viewpoints and by considering
them all equally we can attempt to
reach a better seperation between
right-wrong, justice-injustice.
Certainly not a conclusive

seperation but one that will result
in as much harmony in our society
as is humanly possible,

The views expressed by Mr.
Prices' Mr. Liberal on the subject
of Criticism I found to be totally out
of place in the article Mr. Price
begins with an expression oi a
social philosophy rind moves to an
expression oian opinion pcculiar lo
the behavior of that illdivldual
without distinguishing between the
two. inability to accept criticism is
a trait common to some people oi
both the liberal and conservative
iactions. liiabillty to accept
criticism is not contingent on ones
liberality as Mr Price seems to
suggest. i’ni sure there are narrow
minded liberals around, but they
are not narrow minded because
they are liberal. We must be
careful not to misinterpret an
angry reaction to an ignorant
counterrviewpoinl as inability to
accept criticism and not simply an
emotional attempt at rectitying

what one believes to be a mistake.
Finally, 1 consider in Prices'
criticism, ii he meant it to be that,
to e anything but a criticism. His
m' interpretation oi liberal
philosophy is more oian insult than
a criticism. A criticism takes much
more intelligence and logical and
interpretation than he has
exhibited in his article, This is an
insult that any intelligent in
dividual would tool at the
projection of such a gross
misrepresentation oi something
that many people have taken so
seriously as to devote much or their

lives to.

Kolber: support fusion

Dear Editor;

I Wish to attract support for 21
project which. it implemented,
might well solve the world's
economic problems now and ior
times to come.

it an unlimited supply oi cheap
energy were available, the basis
tor solution or all economic ills
would be at hand. Such a source is
available. According to research
by the U.S Atomic Energy
Commission, KMS Industries of
Ann Arbor, Michigan. and Sovict
scientists controlled nuclear
iusion oiler this hope

Nuclear iusion is sale. it is en-
dorsed as an alternative to
nuclear iission by such eiie
vii-oninentalisl groups s ISPIRG.
The energy source tor iusion
reactors 15 so common that iusion

power could be available in;

deiinitely into the iuture. regar-
dless oi demand.

Though perhaps the salvation of
the world, power~ trom nuclear
iusion is not yet a reality. This is
because of technical diiiiculties.

Many researchers are convinced
that the diflicultics can be over
come, through intensive ciiort,-in
only a ten ars.

Thereiore it has been proposed
that, without delay, the us.
government implement a
“Manhattan ProJect" to develop
controlled nuclear fusion as a
power supply. The proposal has
been endorsed by such iigurcs as
Sen, Stuart Symingtmi (DrMo).
With the World slarving in the {ace
of severe economic diflicultics for
the foi'seeable iutiii‘c, thc iiccd is
urgent

The solution is available.

directly cyen such things as
economic strife and war could all
be wiped out in the reyerbci-atioiis
oi a single stroke—\\ ite at least

and tell hiin-her at your support [or
this bold plan There is no
