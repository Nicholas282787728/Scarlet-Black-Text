In looking orcr the post sei on, with
its almost unhioken string ot victories,
everyone agrees that Captain Tharp is
one oi the pest leaders Grinnell has
ever had. nis t'aitht'ul and consistent
work in every game this year has
earned [or him a place that will he
hard to equal.

R. E. Birch, who iclereed screral
games here and has seen most of the
western teams in action, says that
Tharp is the greatest lorward he has
rier seen. In handling the hall and
ﬁlls oimd inside play he has no equal
within the state.

This year. an injury to his wrist has
been a great handicap to Tharp, and
consistent wor all season sore it no
chance to heal. ’l‘llarl) ditl not make
as many haskcts as he did last year,
but it must he rcmehmered that he
aluays had the nest man of the opposi-
tion to play against, while generally
two or tore men were sent in the
same to stop him, Under siicii Candi»
Lions his work this year has heen mar-

him to a guard position where he
