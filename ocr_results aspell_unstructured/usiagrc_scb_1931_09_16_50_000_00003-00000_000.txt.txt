Alpha Delta chapter of Theta. Sige
me Phi, one of the three fraternities
on the campus, began its existence
as the VVomeu’s Press club of Grin-
nell college in November, 11 years
ago.
Stimulation of the interest of Grin-
ncll women in Journalism as or pro-
{c‘sslon was the purpose of its found-
ers, six upperclassmcn, rind Miss
Eleanor Lowden, assistant professor
of English, and faculty advisor of
the new organization.
Few Courses onercd

At the time of the founding of the
club, the journalism department was
a part of the English department.
Few joumalism courses were given
under the instruction of .i. J, Smert—
enko. a graduate of the University of
Wisconsin, head of the department.

Members of the club met semi-
mcnthly to discuss newspaper probe
lcm-s and mechanics. In coeoperac
tion with the Grinnell chapter of Sig-
ma Delta Chi, the club in ieted and
supervised a convention of represent
stives of Iowa high school publica—
tions.

Edit raper

This was the first event of the kind
in Iowa and the beginning of the
Iowa High School Press association
whose members have been suhse~
quently entertained here for the last
10 years.

Another activity carried on by the
organization in the early years of its
life, was the annual editing of two
i‘ssues of The Scarlet and Black.

On April 23, 1921. the Press club
petitioned the grand council and in-
di duel member chapters of Theta
sigma Phi, women’s national journal-
istic organization, for membership,
This petition was granted in April,
1924. The club then became Alpha
Delta chapter of the national organ-
izetion.

At the present time, the organiz~
aticn has four student members, with
Frances Rate as president, Miss Low»
den is faculty cdvisor and Mrs. R. 31,
Kerr, petroness.

Fillmore Gwynne-Vaughan has
done his hit to help guide the foot~
steps of youth in the right direc-
tion. He not only pointed out the
swimming pool to a wandering
prep, but he explained that those
things with white lines around the
edges, and a net across the middle
were tennis courts
