must work in the interest of peace
and unite against war.

3. There must be a study of peace,
not only vapid sentiments, but un-
mitigated horror of war, both in
Sunday schools and class rooms.
Peace heroes rather than war heroes
should be stressed.

4. The church must insist on alleg—
iance to defimte concrete peace
movements. which may at present he
imperfect, but which will improve
with time.

Charlton, Ise

Discuss Capitalism

“War should be divested of the
chance for profits," stated Prof. Jos-
eph W. Charlton, associate professor
of economics here, in making the
first of his points for a program of
securing peace under captitalism. His
other points in this plan were that
the United States government should
manufacture its own armaments dur-
ing peace times; should not send
military aid to protect foreign invest-
ments and collect debts: and that
the government should lower the tar.
iffs to admit buying and trading with
foreign nations.

Professor Charlton presented his
fourfold plan, with full explanations,
as a means of gaining, “the long
sought for and much desired peace
between nations, that seems far dis-
tant at the present.” _

"There is no morality in economic
imperialism,” exclaimed Prof. John
ire, of the University of Kansas, in
his scathing yet humorous denunciw
tion of capitalism. He pointed out
that all the wars of history, even the
religious wars, have been caused
primarily by economic problems, be-
cause these wars have been profit-
able to certain internts. particularly
“big business," while the proletariat
has paid in bloodshed, hardships, lives,
and money. Professor Ise explained
that capitalism has failed to keep
peace, in fact has projected us into
wars, and that socialism is strongly
against war.

Allen Describes

German Youth

According to Mrs, Minne Allen,
former teacher of sociology at Town
State college and a member of the
German Youth movement, Germany’s
young people are not a unit—since
they differ widely according to local-
ity, social status, vocational interest,
part. and church membership.

Mrs. Allen spoke in Herrick chapel
this morning at 8:30 o‘clock, on “Ate
titudes, Aims, and .Tasks of Ger—
many’s Young People H

”However," she continued, “there
are some common attitudes, aims and
tasks, to be understood from exper-
ience, knowledgcs, practices of the
past and present, and from the very
nature of the youthful person him-
self,"

”In order to unify German youth,
cooperation is needed, requiring opene
mindedness, willingness to appreciate
the other person and nations; willing-
ness to promote the advancement of
the other person and nation; readie
ness and ability to find a common
ground.

“This is more easy for youth than

adults, They arc full of life and eager
ncss to re-form life. They themselves
set the task. The older generation is
willing to equip them for itia chall—
enge, on which the future of man-
kind depends," concluded Mrs. Allen.

Eichelbol‘gei‘ Lauds

League of Nations

Although the League of Nations
has no jurisdiction over citizens
within a state, it has served effec-
tively to reduce the danger of ex-
aggerated nationalism, according to
Clark IVI. Eichelbex‘ger, midwcst sec~
rctary of the League of Nations as.
sociation, who spoke on “Economic
Nationalism and the League of Na»
tions”, In Herrick chapel. last night
at so o'clock.

"It has served this function through
two means at ‘ s command," Eichcl-
bcrger said, “first. by developing the
powerful weapon of world public
opinion, and second, the technique of
daily Collaboration in technical CO-
operation."

Functions Legislatively

“It is indeed amazing," the speaker
declared, ”that the League of Na-
tions while not possessing soverign
power, functions as a legislative body.
It's international treaties, touching
every field of human activity, serve
to regulate international conduct and
consequently circumscribe the no-
man's land where nationalism could
have full sway."

“The Kellogg Pact destroyed the
legal status of war and the world
community now asserts its right to
determine whether or not a nation
is fighting in selfrdefense,”

Need for International Legislation

“1 do not believe the League of Na-
tions will become a super-state, cer-
tainly not, as far into the future as
we can see. However, the need of in-
ternational legislation to regulate
conduct in this complex world and
the tremendous costlinesa of war un-
der modern c onditions will force the
nations to deprive any nation of the
right of‘ warfare, and at the same
time will increase the rules of na~
tioiial conduct through the League
System," Eichelberger concluded.

Herriott Attacks
High Tariffs

“if we are to secure any permau»
ent relief, in the sorry stalement in
international affairs, our statesmen
must contemplate marked reductions
in tariff barriers to the flow of trade
among the nations,” declared Frank
I. Herriott, professor of social science
at Drake university, speaking in Her-
rick chapel last night at 7:30 o'clock.

The subject of his address was
“Economic Nationalism and Inter-
national Friction.“

”We are in a merry-goeround of
nonsense, or should we call it a witch
dance of death," said professor Her.
riott. in stating that one of the main
reactions to national and inter
national tariff is each nation’s as.
sumption of the right to make its own
tariff laws.

Pointing out the adverse effects in
the reactions of the tariff upon fore—
ign relations and internal policy. Her-
riott contended that the Hamiltonian
tariff and its successors down to the
Smoot—Hawley act has been ”the
prolific mother of socialism, and now
of the communism, which is surging
up in our local and state governments
and rolling over Washington in heavy

 

tides."

Spaulding Contest
Tryouts Soon

(Continued from page 1)

Hall Elections
Slated Monday

 

H. W. Spaulding. who founded the
contest for the purpose of fostering
reading aloud, especially among the
women.

Any woman in Grinnell college is
eligible to compete for the three
awards of $25, $15, and $10. and is
offered an opportunity for the study
and practice of reading by the de-
partment of speech.

Will Read Two Selections

Each contestant will be required to
read two selections, one which she
has chosen and one which is to he
read at sight. The average time is
usually from three to five minutes.
As in the men's contest, the winners
are usually selected by the audience.

Mrs, Spaulding believed that read-
ing aloud is one of the means of
getting an education, is the best ap-V
proach to the study and appreciation
of literature, and is a not-imbeeneg—
lected influence in home making.

Urged to Enter

Women of the college are invited
by the department of speech to enter
the Spaulding contest because they
will find a greater value in reading
aloud; they will find the contest of
utmost importance in helping their
interpretation; they will find an op-
portunity to give their reading abil-
ity a real test; they will see how their
reading ability compares with that
of their school-mates: and they may
win $25, $15, or sin in prizes."

The Spaulding contests last year
were won by Mason Meyer and Dorris
Long, both seniors this year.

Further announcements of the pre-
liminary elimination try-outs will be
made soon.

HOUSEMOTHER VISITS

Mrs. Thomas M. Hodgens, house
mother of Smith hall, was able to
leave the Community hospital Thurs-
day after having been sick with a
sore throat condition for the past

tion at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
William Davidson.

at his home in Des Moines for the
