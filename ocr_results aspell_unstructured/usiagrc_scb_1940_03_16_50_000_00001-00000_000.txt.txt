President John S. Nollen Offers Proposal for Fairer Rating
Among Basketball Teams of Schools in Midwest Conference

 

Your publication of final Midwest
Conference standings in basketball
on March 6 raised a question
which was also suggested by the
recent comment in the Des
Moines Register: “Monmouth set
the average points—pergame mark
by tallying 44.4 markers in each
contest. Beloit had the least numr
her of points per tilt, scoring an
average of 34.2, The two teams
tied for third in the final stand-
logs."

in view of the large number of
games won by one or two points,
and therefore governed by chance,
it seems as if the rating of teams
merely on the basis of games won
and lost did not represent fairly
the relative strength of the con—
tending teams. other factors are
at least equally worthy of con—
sideration. The offensive strength
of a team is indicated by the total

 

of points made during the season;
its defensive strength 'by the
points made against it,

still another indicator is the ra-
tio between the total of points
made by and against each team.
In the following tabulation. the
first column shows the rank of
the teams by games won, the sec»
ond the rank by points won, the
th:rd the rank by opponents
points, the fourth the rank by ra-
tios between points won or points
lost, and the final column the
standing by the totals of these
four ranks:

Monmouth
Gl’innell
C03

Ripon
Carleton
Beloit

Cornell 5 8 7 7
Lawrence 8 s 3 23
Knox .7 o a 9 3

According to this composite 1st-
ing, Monmouth comes up from
third to first place, and Ripon
drops from first to fourth; and
Llle fourfold tie for third place. in
column 1, is well resolved. it is
also clear that the single criterion
nearest to the composite rating is
that of the ratio between points
won and points lost, in column 4;
this would evidently yield a fan-er
result than the single criterion of
games won and lost.

1 must confess to a very luke»
warm personal interest in “Cl‘idm-
pionsllips" and comparative rating
of teams. However, if there must
be such comparisons, let them be
made on the broadest and fairest
basis.
