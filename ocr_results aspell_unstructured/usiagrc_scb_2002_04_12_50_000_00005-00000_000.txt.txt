Tijuana, Mexico

Leaders: Denny David '03
and Katie Mears ‘03

Crossing the
border for
service

The trash dump was at least the size of
the Grinnell College campus. it took several
attempts tor the Tijuana alt.~breakers to gain
access to the’dump. "They don't Like Letting
Americans in. It's a bad Pit. piece," said
Denny David ’03. The scene inside the dump
was "by far the hardest experience," accord-
ing to David. "There’s seagulls and dogs ev-
erywhere, and people competing with dogs
for rotten meat and veggies. I was running,
and I had to stop because i was breathing
too much. I was choking back vomit," Group
leaders David and katie Mears '03 knew that
they could reach the ”poorest of the poor”
atthe dump, and the group passed out bags
or food consisting of pounds or rice and
beans. They ended up giving out ”anything
we had,” including granola bars, blankets,
and even the shoes on their feet.

When David was in high school, he be-
gan volunteering for Esperanza, a program
which builds houses and other buildings for
poor Tijuana residents. The homes are built
out or cement blocks and heavily supported
so thattheyare flood and earthquakesafe.

”People come from all over Mexico, so
there's less of a community. [with
Esperanza]. they’re committing to a lot of
land and a community," said David.

Another important aspect of Esperanza
is residentcontrolled bank accounts, which
establish community resources. According to
David, money from these accounts can be
used to contribute to mucheneeded services
such as sewage and plumbing. In one case,
a community used interest to help a single
mother pay for housing.

"it’s notjust building a house, but long-
term, exponentialchange. We didn’treellike
iruity, rich Americans saying 'let’s pet an
orphan.‘ We helped make substantive
changes," said David.

The group built a house for Esperanza
the iirst week, and during the second week
they painted Rosarito School and cleaned
up at Jugar Iniantil orphanage.

Forthe leaders, one of the most difﬁcult
situations actually occurred before the trip
began. Due to a funding cut, the leaders
had to raise $10,000, and they eventually
received funding from the SGA treasurer,
President Osgood, the Roseniield iund, and
others. However, the trip also included
lighter moments. During Passover, the group
bought a pinata that they assumed was a
representation of Jesus. "The border guard
asked us, ’15 that the new 0sama bin Laden
pinata?’ Then an army guy came over and
told us, ’Vou were gonna break open Jesus?
That ain't right,” said David,

”We didn’t want to persecute 0sama bin
Laden," said Mears. "We just wanted to per»
secuteiesus."

Meghan kirkwood accompanied the group
as a photographer and plans to eventually
create a publication of photos and essays
concerning the experience. Mears and David
will also give a Roseniield Symposium pre~
sentation on the trip.

David hopes that Grinnell continues to
offer volunteer programs in Tijuana. "Its
about establishing a global community. We
read books about globalization, but its not
the same as seeing a kid whose parents can’t
support it."

trip to New York city and that maybe
we could do something in Chinatown.”

During the first week, the group
worked with Black and Latino youths
to renovate housing units for the
homeless in Harlem. They also spent
time at several senior centers dancing,
playing pool, surﬁng the internet, and
hanging out with the elderly.

Next, they performed ”Street theater” with the Street

That weekend, they went on a ”weekend getaway trip" to

The second week, the group worked with ﬁrst generation

out at a soup kitchen.

”From the minute we walked in
[to the soup kitchen], there was so
much energy," Perng said. “i thinkI

One of the main benefits of the
trip was the extensive interaction
with a variety or people in the city.
"We talked to Harlem youth, youth

said. ”[We] interacted with them and learned from them and

Gardening
in NYC

As Shannon Heirernan do was working
to clean up a community garden in Brook-
lyn with the help of a group of children,
one particular child approached her. The
young girl asked heirernan to be her mother
or sister.

”But she was Black and I was White, and
she thought this was a problem," Heffernan
said. ”So she picked up the mud from the
garden and smeared It on my legs and face

. and told me I could be her mother then. It

was very cute Iwasn’t quite sure how to
react, though.”

This is just one of the experiences that
stands out vividly from the two weeks the
group spent in the New York City area. The
group was in the Manhattan area the first
week, where they worked with a geriatnc
center. They collected stories of elderly in-
dividuals on videotape, helped put together
a resource guide for elderly individuals in
the New York area and assisted with the
daily activities of the seniors.

During the weekend, they washed walls
at the Catholit Worker, a soup kitchen, shelr
ter, and "unorncial center or social justice,"
Heffernan said.

Next, they went to Brooklyn to work on
a community garden. ”There had been quite
a battle about how the garden should look
in the community," Heffernan said. ”The
result of this was a lot of construction ma-
terials, layers and layers of rugs that were
put over the garden, and just lots oriunk in
the garden."

This week was very difﬁcult, herrernan
said. The group didn't have the resources
they needed to get the garden done. For
example, they had an extremely difﬁcult time
getting a truck to pick up the trash they
cleared from the garden.

They called the sanitation department,
but couldn’t get a truck to come to the area
in which they were working at first. ”It was
just heartbreaking,” Herrernan said. ”There
was trash piled from here to there that we
had cleared."

The group called for a truck repeatedly
and ﬁnally went back to work. Several hours
later, Heffernan said, "We suddenly hear,
'beepbeepbeepbeep: This truck comes up.
and everyone’s aims are just ilying,” she said.
”I’ve never been so happy to hear a trash
truck in my entire life It was very excit-
ing for trash, very exciting.”

The idea to travel to New York stemmed
from :o-leader Laura Polslein ’OA's priorwork
with Community Gardens. A Grinnell alum
at Green Thumb helped the group locate
community gardens to work with, and
Heffernan and Polstein called other organi-
zations in New York to fill the two weeks.

“One lesson I continually get taught in
doing service, particularly alt. breaks, is that
they are more for the good oi the individu-
als who go on them than the good of the
communities a lot of times," Hefferrian said.
"I think it one is going to make any real
change, [commitment] usually needs to be
pretty long term, but going on these breaks
teaches us about these communities, teaches
us how we can find places to help, gets the
basic tools in our batkpacks."
