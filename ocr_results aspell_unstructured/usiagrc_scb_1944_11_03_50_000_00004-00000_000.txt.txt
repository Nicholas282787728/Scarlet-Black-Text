GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Ancien’r Orienlal Ginkgo
Will Blossom Al Las’r

By Stuart Roedel-
Hold the presses! Scoop! Flash!
Here's the official story on the
first gingko seeds to appear on
the Grinnell campus in the col.
Iege’s history.

The ginkgo seed is the fruit
of the ginkgo tree, two of which
are now growing on the (kiln
nell campus. One was planted
west of Magoun hall and the 5907
ond north of Blair hall by pres-
ident Daniel Bradley about 1904.
During the past forty years there
has been no evidence of flowers
on the trees.

Dissection of this year's seed
specimens reveals stages of em»
bryonic development which indi-
cate pollination. Botanically
speaking, one tree is supposed to
bear seed flowers and the other
pollen flowers. This year the
tree west of Magoun is bearing
seeds which would indicate that
its neighbor at Blair has the
pollen flowers.

The ginkgo tree is a native of
the orient, and it is highly prob-
able that it no longer exists in
the wild state. All ginkgoes in
the United States are cultivated
and have been grown from seeds
imported from the orient. The
ancestors of this tree. the co-
daites, were native to this area,
and their fossils are found in
the rocks of about 250,000,000
years ago. As the Cold Age re-
ceded. the ginkgo family tree
apparently followed the cold
weather north, spreading into
Greenland and the northern parts
of the hemisphere. somehow it
skipped down into Asia and died
out in North America. The gink-
go now stands as the sole sur~
vivor of uiat botanical group to
which it belonged; all others are
extinct.

As to the physical characterise
tics of the seed, it resembles a
small yellow plum. It has a
semi-tough complexion. The tree
itself develops into a truly beau-
tiful bit of foliage after its for-
tieth year, rounding out and ﬁlls
ing its branches with its yellow
fan like leaves.
like leaves.

But, oh, what a personality.
It literally smells. Yes. very lite
erally. It has a terrific case of
B. o. and lialitosis combined. Dr.
Henry conard explains that it
contains butteric acid, which is
a subtle way of saying it smells
like rancid butter. one of Dr.
Conard's experiments revealed
that, by adding base alcohol and
sulphuric acid and heating the
combination you get a smell re.
sembling pineapple.

The laurels for finding Grin-
nell college's very first gingko
seed go to Miss Louisa Sargent,
associate professor of biology,
who announces that the seeds will

be used in part for dissection;
and some will be planted in an
attempt to cultivate new trees.
So far a pint of seeds has been
accumulated.

Two trees of the same species
are located in town and they have
been bearing seeds for years.

so, quick, Joe, a ginkgo!

tional banking agreements reach—
ed at the Bretton Woods meeting
are designed to order world fi-
nances, keep down inflation, and
stabilize exchange rates for the
benefit of the people.

Outlining the structure of the
proposed international bank and
international fund, Miss Hersel-
ius said that the united states
,has the largest vote of any na.
ltlon on questions of monetary
policy. Votes are apportioned by
the amount of money contribute
ed by member nations.

The principle objections to the
Bretton Woods p'lan, Miss Hersel-
ius said, come from private bank-
ers who fear that international
loans will replace private loans.
However, she said that the bank
is too small to do all the business
needed. Among other objections
she listed the fear that Ameris
can interests will lose their finan-
cial influence.

In conclusion she pointed out
that even if the Bretton Woods
agreement is accepted, many ob»
stacles will hinder international
economic coeperatio - the tariff
question, mutual distrust among
nations, and the settling of debts
owed at the present time.

Haines junior, will discuss feders

Ah, but such is not the fate

I had a slight chance very

are very well fed. But I stray

Yankee forces made immediate

Then, as suddenly as they came,
they were gone — on to further
