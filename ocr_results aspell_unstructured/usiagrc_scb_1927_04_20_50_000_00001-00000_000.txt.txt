HEW SERIES.

MEEi HUNUHE IN
HUME THABK WUN
BY JU_N||]_H GLASS

Completely Upset Dope by Taking
Meet With 431/2 Counters;
Seniors Second.

DAVIS GETS MOST POINTS

Freshmen Third and Sophomores
Take First Place; McKee
Runs Great Race.

The junior class won the annual
home track meet held Saturday on
Ward field by netting is 1-2 points.
The seniors were second with 33
points, and the freshmen and sophoe
mores followed with 29 1-2 and 25
points respectively.

Since Saturday was the first day
on which the weather hasn’t been ex-
ceedingly damp, the track was none
too fast. in spite of the warm \veatln
er, the runners had to face a brisk
south wind, which slowed up their
time considerably.

The first event of the afternoon, the
high hurdles, resulted in a victory for
Taylor, a freshman. Davis was a
close second to Taylor, and finished
with yards to spare ahead of Long
and Patton, who were third and
fourth, The mile run, next on the
program, was won by Whitley with
comparative ease. Wyatt cud Wenger
of the sophomore class were second
and lhird.

Dilsll Will is Upset

In the 100 yard dash the first upset
occurred when “Sonny" Davis ﬁnish-
ed first, followed closely by Kennedy
who had been doped to win the event,
and Beck, who tied with Kennedy for
second and third places. slye finislr
ed fourth. The time of the winner
was 10.7 seconds.

McKee of the sophomores, came the
closest to breaking a track record of
any one in the meet when he ran the

_ 440 yard dash in 51.9 seconds against
the wind. McKee stepped out in front
of the pack after they had run about
50 yards, and held a safe lead through-
out the run. Taylor finished second
about fifteen feet behind McKee,

Davis won the low hurdles, but was
closely followed by llfaytum, who
probably would have won had he not
stumbled after clearing the last bar-
rier. Maytum came back to win the
220 yard dash, after Hoffman had
beaten Whitley in the half mile by a
desperate last minute sprint.

Rinefort Breaks Only Record

In the field events the only record
breaking performance of the aftere
noon took place. Capt. “Moco” Rins-
tort broke the former record for the
discus throw with a heave of 142 feet
10 172 inches. This eclipses the old
mark by nearly four feet. The old
record was also held by the Pioneer
captain, Rinefort also won the shot
with a mediocre heave of 42 feet 1
inch.

Greene, a freshman, won the pole
vault with a leap of 10 feet 6 inches.
Bender and Duke tied for second at
9 feet 6 inches but both cleared 10
feet 6 inches after the competition
was over.

Laird nearly threw his old mark
for the javelln into discard when he
heaved the weapon over 180 feet, but
the throw was a foul, Laird stepping
over the line. After that his best at-
tempt was 172 feet, one inch below
the record,

Davis, junior, was high point man
with 18 points.

not attend, will be enforced next year,
and that no one placed on the black
list will receive another bid to
Griuuell gridiron banquet and razz
last, was made this morning by of-
ilcers of the organization, Cavinclr
dent with this announcement came the
assertion that not only will college
freshmen be excluded from attending
the banquet next Sautrday night, but
that no sophomores with the exceir
ion of members of tlic journalistic

a

fraternity will be in attendance.

Although a phenomenal raise of two
cents (fl‘0m$ i to $2.26) wits initiat-
ed by prolitecrs of banquet ticket
stock, it is reported [hilt very few re-
ceiving bids plan to reiect them. Those
who have mailed checks to Donald
Brown, treasurer of Sigma Delta Chi,
or to William Crouch, Clark ball, will
be sent tickets to present at the
dining hall, while others who pay in

Three of Coach Duk ’s men, all
special event performers, will be the
only entries from Gl'illiiell in the fifth
animal Kansas relays at Lawrence on
Friday and Saturday. captain Foster
(lioco) Riiiefort, Gordon llfecter and
Donald Larid will be the Pioneer coni-
potitors.

Rillelort and Meeter will both throw
the discus, and, from comparative
data should both place near the top
in this event. Riuefol't won the plat-
terrtossing contest in the Rice insti-
tute games last month with a toss of
143 feet. This distance betters the
record or Plait of Denver at the Kan-
sas relay carnival by approximately
10 feet. The Pioneer captain has been
bettering the 145 foot mark can
sistently in practice all season, and
should provide ample competition for
first honors.

dicotcr Should Place

Meeter tossed the discus over the
137 foot mark in the home meet on
Saturday, and, with another mark of
this kind in the iayhaw games,
should place in the upper quintet.
“Butch" has not yet reached his best
form in the shot event and conse-
quently will not be entered.

Rinefort will compete in the weight
throwing contest, and if done can be
relied on, should place not farther
back than second. His only serious
competitor should he Lyons of lllin»
ois, who conquered the Pioneer in
both of the Texas meets in March,

Laird Mity Score

Laird will enter his favorite event,
the javelin, and although having taken
part in but one meet, the home meet,
may break into the scoring column. His
best heave, 187 feet, was made in the
Drake dual last spring, but the big
spear flinger gives promise of sur-
passing all his previous endeavors
this season. In the home meet last
Saturday, although the weather eon-
di one were far from favorable, he
distanced the fieldinthe ei-entwith a
throw of 172 fet. This mark should
place him well in almost any kind of
competition.

practice will be a decided handicap to

same handicap w in probably be felt by-
the other team.

There will be four lettermeu lrom last

candidates. However, a sophomore is
expected to break into the play with
the ﬁrst match, and will probably han-
die the Number one assignment. This
is Harris coggeshall, versatile Des
Moilles boy, who takes up basketball
in the winter as a means of conditions

SLruble, who is eaptaiuing this

Uneducated Listener Admits That
Education of Debaters Is a Curse

Dear Editor,

This here discussion about ejuka—

allus thought tbet gettin‘ a college
cjukaskun wuz a purty good way 0’
grabbin' n coupla years 0' rest, an- i
sure been enioyin’ myself, but the way
them guys at thet debate “1' other
night talked, they got me all belied
up on this ejukas'bun propisishun. I
never did quite get just what they
wuz argyfyin‘ about, but by golly to
hear 'em. you’d a thought a edjuka-
shun wuz the worst crime you could
do except say-ln' a bad word like heck
when somebody licked the team.

Well, enyhow. it seems as how they
spent mosta their time argyin' if
eiukashun wuz iist a ten-year term or
a lite sentence. Them chapel seats
is too hard to sleep in or I wouldn't
have kicked about that, but gosh I
shuld think they’dlt settled that be
forehand.

1 sure got enthused when one guy
told anothern that his talk was all
sound. That's what I'd been wautln'
to say for the last hour, only I hadn’t
got a good chanet.

An‘ say, i sure saw how all the
girls that eat the Quad, smiled kinda
sad an‘ knowin’ like when one feller

started talkin' about developin’ cast
iron stomachs at college. Gee, the
poor feller had to eat at tll’ Quad
himself that night 7 no wonder he
lnensbuned it.

I wisht they‘d stick to English
though. They got to speelin' along
in some furrih language and I jest git
a feeli ' they're tryin’ t' put suthin'
over on us. Take that guy that. reeled
of! some junk endin' up with “Enslcler—
jpcdier Bertannica' —now he could jist
its wella said that in English.

But I tell yuh, I'd be dlli'ned before
I’d Sit up there all night and let sum
feller call me n liar, even if lie did do
it polite and gent1e~llkc, About then.
l’dét sucked that bozo so hard on the
coconut that they wouldn't even a
bothered to take him to the hospital.
Nobody couldn’t Dull nothin' like that
on me. '

Ych, this here ejllkashun is sum

they proved all rite that cjukashun is

lndividualist ls
Tolerant—Perry

Tells of Harvard Ideals In Long
Chapel Talk on “Essence
of Individualism.”

“The gospel of individualism is self-
reliance and tolerance," said Prof,
Ralph Barton Perry, Harvard ex~
change lecturer in his address on the
“Essence of Individualism" at long
chapel this morning.

Prof, Perry spoke at length on Hal-A
var-d, of its unformulated creeds, of its
ideals and its part in Americanism.
of individualism as set forth by two
Harvard men, "Ralph Emerson has
said that every college should not
tend to drill but to create, so that
each student will be reckoned as an
individual and not as one of a hun~
drcd. William James said. in speak-
ing of Harvard, that men come from
all over the country,bovering in the
background, but nevertheless exalted
by the nourishment they receive. The
highest aspirations of Harvard are
portrayed by these two men.”

Labor Not Dangerous.

“Free labor argues that beads and
hands should work together, and that
ediicatiou for labor is not dangerous.
Every band should be cultivated to
help in its work,” the speaker said in
speaking of the views of Abraham
Lincoln. “Selfrrellnnce and tolerance
is the gospel of individualism. A man
must be self-reliant, have a will of
his own and feet to stand on, and he
must be tolerant so that he can so
cept individual differences in judge~
meats."

“Ari individualist is not necessarily
conceited, selfish, snobbish, oi disv
loyal. It is natural that the individ-
ualist should be suspected of this. He
does hos own thinking and so may
differs from his neighbor. An individ-
ualist is often said to prefer to all
opinions that which he calls reason.
A lover of truth is not conceited but
simply oppose wrong public opinion.

“Individualism implies self-reliance,
but that is far different from conceit.
1-ie relies on his power, not past acll~
ievement. He is proud because he
cannot be bought, and humble because
he is so conscious of his shortcomings.
if we observe carefully and think
straight, we will be brought into line
with other careful observers and
straight thinkers.

HARVARD WINS BY 154 T0 73

Audience Decision on Merits of
Debating Rather Then on
Discussion Topic.

”College education today is a stand-
ar-di-tius process; for nearly every
one, It means the loss of originality
in a forced diet of useless facts and
mental gymnastics. That was the
statement of the debate team from
H: vard university, Monday night in
Her ck chapel when they won an
audience decision on the question,
"Resolved, that education is the curse
of the age," 154 to 73 votes, with 36
voting neutral,

The discussion, rippling with hu-
mor, full of common sense, but lack—
ing in argumentative clash, was held
before an audience that nearly filled
the chapel. Dr. Ralph Barton Perry
of llarvard presided. The audience
vote was on. the merits of the debating.

Defining education, contrary to the
definition of Harvard, as that which
makes existence into life, Grinnell’s
negative team added past there were
two types of education; the formal
education of school processes and the
casual educational process of every-
day life. the field of practical exper-
ieilce.

Liie Seli Renewing

"Lite is a selfel-elielving process
through action on environment. Ex-
istence plus education equals life and
life minus education leaves mere ex-
istence," alleged Swigert, who opened
the Grinnell negative.

Frederick Lorenzen, Dwight W.
Chapman and Barrett Williams ef<
feetively presented their interpreter
tion of the question. “Colleges," they
declared, “take in thousands of men,
many of whom have at least a spark of
genius and originality. They cram
useless facts into their heads for four
years; they compel them to take
many of the same courses and at the
end of the time they turn their grad-
uates out like so many sausages from
the same sausage grinder. They ut—
terly_kill any chance for a man to
think creatively and originally and so
stamp out many a possible genius.
Fewer and fewer are the notable men
who are college graduates. Because
education standardizes and devitalizes
today, it is the curse of the age.”

Forget Chsnhl Education

Grinnell, represented by Mack
SwigerL, Laurence Lunden and Loren
Reid, pointed out that Harvard forgot,
in their attack on formal education,
that most important field of casual
education, by the everyday experiences
of which an individual rises from a
position or mere physical existence at
the time of birth to one of mental
equality and happiness with fellow
men in life. They declared that the
slowly rising plane of civilization and
advancement of man today, as evi<
denced by his conquest of science in
the telephone, radio, electricity, and
television is but one evidence of the
value of education in making the world
happier. Without casual education life
becomes mere existence.

After the debate no open forum was
held. Later the Harvard and Grinnell
teams were entertaind at a smoker in
Clark hall. The debate was preceded
by a formal dinner for the Harvard
team at the Quadrangle at six o‘clock.

This discllssionrdebute closed the
forensic season for Grinnell. During
the season dual debates for men
were held with Ames, Drake. lowa
state Teachers college, Nebraska and
Harvard. All out the one with Har-
vard were on the MeNary-Haugen bill.
The debates were either no decision
or audience decislon discussions. The
season for the girls included debates
with Rockford college and Penn col»
lege.
