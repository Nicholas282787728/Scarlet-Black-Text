Stranger In

by Chuck Stegmeir

Working on the assumption
that as colorful a career as our
sixth ‘stranger' hes should not
be kept under a bushel, we in-
vited him to jin our select
but growing society.

Born “shorin after the turn
of the century" in York, Neb.,
he was one of eight kids his
mother “put through the music
mill.” She developed a defin-
ite ’proceclure for bringing up
her children in order to reveal
any musical talent, and in our
.‘stranger’ and a brother and
sister, such talent appeared.

After graduating from high
school in York, he went to the
University or Nebraska at Lin-
coln where he started out as
a pre-uied student. He chang—
ed his major to music arter
winning a scholarship and the
highest rating at a state inu—
sical contest. He received a
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree
in 1927 and a Bachelor of
Music degree in 1928.

During his undergraduate col
lege years, he made wide use
of his musical ability. He head.
ed a small combo which played
at houseparties and fraternity
dances, As pianist in a Lincoln
movie theater, he often played
scores ‘far the movies which ap»
peared, since sound was just
coming in then, and he played
for travelling shows and mys-
tery shows as well.

All five of his summers at
this time were occupied, by i
tours, on which he travelled
‘with concert companies, giv»
ing programs every day but
Sunday. in the course of these ,
tours, he visited all but six
states. Following his last tour
he attended the Juilliard
School oi Music in New York
on a scholarship ior 192mm

He taught tor a year at Kane
sas state Teachers college in
Emporia, and then, in the sum-
mer at 1930, went on a summer
scholarship to the Beaux Arts
school in Fontainebleau, France.
From then until he carrie to
Grinneli in law, he spent most
of the year teaching first at
Midlands college in Fremont,
Neb., and later at Stephens
college in Columbia, Mo. while
his summers were as varied as

hours.

During several of these sum
mers he attended the summer
session of Northwestm‘n univer-
sity, earning his Master of Mn-
sic degree in 1937. While in $116
Chicago area. he played with

a dance hand on the North
side, in,various night clubs,
and with -an orchestra in the
Clix-liege Inn of the Sherman ho-
to

In 1936, he lett teaching
ior one year to go to stutt-
gart, Germany, the area from
which his parents came, to
study. He traveled through
Italy and Germany and spent
another summer in Fontaine-
hleaii.

The college organist from
1942 to 1944, he admits that
“he could still knock off some
pretty good boogie or swing."
He also considers himself for-
tunate that his background has
not been a strict classical one
out a rather venturesome one.”
