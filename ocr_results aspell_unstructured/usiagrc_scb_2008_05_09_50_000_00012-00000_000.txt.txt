Fix pro evaluations

A friend of mine recently sat in philosophy class
filling out a class evaluation. While she stopped short
of using her left hand, sheconsciously felt the need to

altcr hcr handwriting, as shc was one ofonly a few girls
in the class and worried that the professor would rec-
ognize her handwriting,

PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT SYS-
TEM

First, class evaluations take time out ofclasslnstead
ofprofcssor stalking rhrough one last point before ﬁnal
exams, rhcy musr either give up class time or hold a
class late. In rare instances,such as percussion ensemble
this year, we were never even given the evaluations.

Second, evaluations crammed into the last few min-
utes ofclass results in hurried and less accurate feedback

Third is the handwriting Issue, Even If professors
are give nevaluations aftcr ﬁnalizing grades, it is almost
impossible to avoid raking classes from certain profcsV
sors multiple times. This means that every negative
or positive evaluation could still affect future student-
professor dynamics.

AN ALTERNATIVE: ONLINE COURSE
EVALUATIONS

The easiest my to fix these problems would be
to move evaluations onto PioneerWeb, This scenario
would look something like this. At 4:05 on the Friday
of hell week, every “course area"on PioneerWeb would
contain a class evaluation survey.

Students would then have the next two or three
weeks to fill out all their class ewrluazions The single
biggest problem with this approaclus making sure
everyone ﬁlls them out; however, this could easily be
solved by requiring that evaluations be filled out before
students' grades are releascd.

ADVANTAGES OF ONLINE COURSE
EVALUATIONS

This approach to class evaluations would have
many advantages Including the alleviation of all three
major problems with the current system of coursc
evaluations.This solution takes no time from end-of-
semester classes, allows students all the time they need
to fully ﬁll out the evaluations, and. most importantly,
docs not reveal snidents’handwriting.

Additionally, using this format would allow profuse
sors to append any additional questions rhar go beyond
the scope of the standardized cmluat'lon. Many profes-
sors already do this as well as have midterm evalua—
tions, and this would allow faster and more efficient
data collection.

Another advantage of online evaluations is that the
data would be crunchcd and displayed immediately by
PioneerWeb. This would remove the time required to
“scantron” the data and would give professors the ad-
ditional option of even cross-tabulating or doing other
more advanced data analysis.

In passing this idea by a few peoplc,l have heard
only positive responses, although it is open for cririe
cisrn. An informal administrative inquiry gave me the
impression that this system would not be hard to im-
plement if the college chose to do so.

I see no reason why this system cannot be In place
by the end of next semester, and I call on SGA’s cabie
noteclcct to push for thc implementation of this system
by the end ofnexr semester.
