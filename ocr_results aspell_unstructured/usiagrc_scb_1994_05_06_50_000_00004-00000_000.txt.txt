Youths grapple with their identity

Generation X, slacker stereotypes abound, but many are questioning their accuracy

AVING no expectations
H means never being disap—

pointed" would seem a fit-
ting epithet for today's university
studentpopuiation that is faced with
more problems than it seemingly
can handle.

Violence is at levels never be-
fore witrtﬂsed; environmental deg-
radation continues apace; the out-
look on the economy is bleak at best.
Many have argued that it is not a
good sign when the musician who
arguably best articulates (and sells)
the youth‘s dysfunction bows out at
the end of his own gun.

Yetmany observers of the youth
culture remain hopeful.

Margie Alt, associate director
of the non-profit Fund for Public
Interest Research, has been organiz-
ing students around various political
issues for more than 12 years. She
said she feels positiveabout the situ-
ation on campus.

“Young people are capable of
phenomenal things," Alt said. add—
ing that today’s technology allows
youths to organize and communi-
cate issues like no generation before
them. She said that students in the
‘90s have access to global satellite
communication systems. they are
faxing letters to Congress, and they

are becoming increasingly sophistir
cated in using the infomation su-
perhighway.

”Yet the most important part of
this is making sure it is the proper
information being disseminated,"
she said. “We (the public) own the
airwaves, but we do not control the
media. The market forces that do
not want a change in the status quo
continue to dominate the media."

Nicholas B utterwonh, executive
director of Rock The Vote, echoed
Alt's optimism about youths. Rock
The Vote works to involve thou-
sands of young people in the demo-
cratic system, primarily through
voter registration, but also by edu»
cating students about the national
health care debate.

Exploiting popular alternative
media such as MTV, Rock The Vote
has begun to tap into the huge and
potentially powerful 18~ to 25»year-
old demographic category.

These are smart, cynical people
waiting for something better to come
by. Lfthey seem lessthaninvolved,it’s
because they‘re too smart for the sys-
tem as it’s currently practiced,"
Butterworth said. “The university
aged group is interested and knowl»
edgeablein thepolitical process. Rock
The Vote straw voter registration
becausewebelieveindemocracy. The
alternative to fascism."

Butterworth said that pop cul»
ture, especially music, taps into

today's discontent

“Music is more political than
politics. It sets up freedom and is
completely open to individual inter
pretation," he said. “Music allows
communication within the genera-
tion mat is not happening among
this and other generations. Altemar
tive media outlets like MTV provide
somewhat ofa refuge for this group
ofyouth whoeschew labels thatoth-
erstry to attach. Phrases like ‘Slack-
crs,GeneraLtonX,andtheBahyBustv
ers’ refuse to stick."

In Butterworth’s opinion, those
who are trying to categorize and
market young people are not talking
with or listening to young people.

“Youths are ponmyed as helpless
victims when they opt out of normal
jobs,“ he said. “However, it seems
they have chosen to do what fulﬁlls

them rather than necessarily do time in
an emotionallyaurtrewardin g job.
Hannah Nordhaus, a free-lance
writer and recent Yale University
graduate, agreed with Butterworth.
”This generation ts less interested
in the traditional work ethic," she said.
”They don‘t give their life to IBM.
The focus on career has shifted to
‘what will make me the happiesl‘l’"
In spite of Rock The Vote’s
efforts, only 20~percent of 18-25-
yearrolds voted inthe 1992 election.
What will it take to mobilize more
young people to action? Alt sug-
gests that the change could entail “a
higher consciousness revolution."
“There is a better awareness
of consumer excess and the lim-
ited natural resources that fuel
it," Alt said. “Today’s student»
aged people are more likely to

question whether a disposable
society is Worth mountains of
solid waste and water in many
cities that is approachtng an unr
drinkable state. Otherissues beg-
ging to be addressed are health
care, campaign finance reform and
the reform of Social Security,"

No one can predict when, or
if, today's youths will galvanize
for change, but the numbers are
there, at least In terms of elec-
toral politics.

“New voters have enormous
leverage to decide elections,"
Butterworth said. “lfwe tap into
all eligible young voters, we can
determine the outcome on 80-
percent of elections nationwide.
Legislators have gotten used to
low voter turnouts. We have to
change that,"

Gen X label confounds many

Can our generation be lumped into one big group?

By Elizabeth M. Cooke
NSNS Staff Writer

other generation has been

scrutinized, analyzed, mar-
keted and packaged Until re-
cently, people managed to avoid
cute monikers ending in “some
thing.” Until recently, the labels
were more like “hippies and
yuppies," or “punks and jocks."

That was before Douglas
Coupland published his 1991
book Generation X. talerfar an
accelerated culture. The book
centers around three characters
who are overedueated, underpaid,
and searching for meaning.

Also in 1991, the release of
Richard Linklater's film Slacker
helped to further define the post-
baby boom generation. With the

IT has happened again. An-

 

 

popularity of this year’s Reality
Bites, the label “Generation X”
is now firmly associated with
those in their 205.

Yet labels are markers at-
tached to objects to indicate their
contents. Do the terms Genera-
tion X or slacker accurately por-
tray the people in this genera»
tion? Many say no,claiming that
people under the age of 30 are far
too diverse to be categorized so
rigidly.

Anthony Sansone, a student
at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison, said he doesn't see the
validity of labeling.

“Basically, it is the older gen—
eration trying to undersrand their
successors," said Sansone, 22.

StevenGrant, 26, agreedwith
Sansone. “This is a fairly insig—
nificant label thrown on a wide
group of people."

Robert Adams, also 26, be-
lieves that the Gen X label over-
plays the distance between this
generation and the previous one.
Adams, who is working on his
doctorate in anthropology atUni«
versity of Texas-Austin, said that
the values of his generation are
still close to those of his parents.

“Generational attitudes can
be circular,“ heobscrved. “Some
of the attitudes that some india
viduals in this generation project
are reminiscent of the dissatis»
faction expressed by F. Scott
Fitzgerald’s and Hemingway‘s
generation."

Butwhatdistinguishesthisgen-
erationfromthepreviousoneistech-
nology, according to Adams.

“This generation is the first
to grow up with computers and
we are now seeing technology
enter into other areas,“ he said.
