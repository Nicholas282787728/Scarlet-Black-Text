of Giving Glinnell Chance
To Help In China.

COLLEGE WAS FIRST IDEA;
ACADEMY MORE NE G'ESSARY
Not Enough Academics to Prepare
Students for the Present
Univcl

The Grinnell-iu-Cliiiut movement
found its birth in 15310 when the idea
or (leﬁllltel) aligning Glinncll College
with a constructirc piece 01' educa-
tional work in China seized the imagi-
uatioii and conviction oi a few men.
A. B. Del‘lailn. ’06. working at Techou
conceived the idea of placing Grinncll
men and women and money at work to
mould the educational situation in a
portion of shantung Pioi nice. China.
The proposition was that students. (her
ulty and alumni should unite in sup-
porting an educational system that
should aid in the development of that
part; at China as Grinncll has aided
in the development or this part or
America.

Need For l’l‘l‘ptt‘l‘tlmry Schools.

At ﬁrst it was hoped that a college
could be built similar to the one here
but those on the ground realized that
the great need was for preparatory
schools. The lower schools were not
able to prepare enough students {or
the already . ting colleges and nui—
reisities. And so it was decided to
put the inaior elfoi-t into the academy
at Techou and to building up the pri-
mary schools at that region.
higher educational work was to be
conﬁned to cooperating in the Union
University being built at Tsinaniit. the
capital of the province.

Share Spirit
With Brothers

Grinnell is introducing an innova-
tion in making a direct clfort to send
a bit of its college spirit to its off-
spring in China. it number of Ameri
can colleges have adopted the plan or
sending men and money to carry on
work in a particular section in China,
but the deliberate attempt to trans-
plant school spirit is a new and inter-
esting experiment.

The school at Techou or which Milo
Eachron, '11, is principal, is the ins .
tution to which most oi our support
goes and in which our chief interest
naturally centers. 1t ' a school or

EDUCATING WOMEN SIMILAR T0

TEA CHIMG

There is a Chinese saying that you
might as Well try to teach a cow as to
t: , to teach a girl. Education for wa-
men was practically unheard of In
China a. few years ago but from the

very beginning Grihhellslurchina has‘

planned to serve the need or women as
well as men. Two brick buildings on
the Techou campus are separated from
the rest by a loiv brick wall, but ac»
cording to Chinese convention, a girl's
school without a wall is impossible,
so the wall within a wall.
Gil-ls nine No Company.

In one of these buildings the girls
study. recite, and sleep; the other
serves as dining room, kitchen and
laundi . There are no pal-leis, for
the girls have no company, so the
school gatherings take place in the
school rooms. Miss Msbcl Huggins
and Miss Alice Reed, '13, have general
charge of the school but much at the
teaching is done by native teachers
who live in the dormitories while Miss
Huggins and Miss Reed live in the La.
dles’ House with the other unmarried
women.

Girls Ilntc Minus.

The girls come from preparatory
schools at tuber stations and when
they ﬁnish their course at Techou are
then ready for an academy. Many at
them can attend school only a year or
two, They feel very badly to leave
the school even for vacations because

they are happy there One require-
ment for admission is that their iecl
must be unbound so a good deal or
emphasis is placed on gymnasium

as possible. One form or exeieise is
