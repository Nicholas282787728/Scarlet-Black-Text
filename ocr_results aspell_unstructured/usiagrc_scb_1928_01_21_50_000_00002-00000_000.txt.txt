THE H01 i COJDIITTEF. PLAN.

The plan for the e. ension of building government
failed to pass in a majolity of the men’s halls \Vsdnes—
day night principally because the men felt that somer
thing \\'as,being forced on them without time [or consid
eration. it the council or house chairmen had given
the plan some publicity and the men time to talk over
the situation instead of zluppezll'ing to flush a measure ill-
to being. We believe that the “house committee” plzln
would have passed.

The details of the plan lire printed elsewhere in th
issue, but the idell in brief is this: that a house commit-
tee of from three to six members be elected by the men
in each hill! "to aid in the enforcement at Senate rules
and to make other provisions (or the betterment or
building lite,” The house chairman is to be an ex-of—

licio member of the committee and mm or the members is
to be elected from the Court body.

The chief objection to the plan scomtxi to he clmlse
D under Section IV of the powers, “The members of
House Committees shall tcei tbomselres obligated to re-
port all major intractions of Senate rules to the Student
Court." They considcrod that this clause placed the
members oi the committee in the posiﬁon of "stool
pigeons" or the CourL The real interpretation oi the
clause is this: that an infractions or rules come under
the notice of the building committee anyway, but major
infl'ilctlons must he nut of their hands entirely, in order
to preserve the student Court, and must be handled by
the Court instead of by the committee. it is really a
safeguard against the committee assuming two much
power and should be regarded in that light,

it a student wcrc apprehended by the committee in
committing a major infraction of rules, he would have
the Court mcnibci of his own building committee to pro
sent his case to the student Judicial body and he would
u bnbly got a fairer decision than he docs now.

in view of the recent disturbances in the buildings,
a body of the type suggested would be or great aid in
stopping the troubles at their bascr The building bottle
battles could be stopped before they were started. 1

Nor would separate building committees having no
connection with the Student Court or a higher body he
eficctivo. Thcrc must be some co-ordination between the
two in order to prevent the conflict of authority.

“What good would it do?" the plan‘s opponents ask,
To which “'2 counter, “What harm would it do for one
semester at least?" Unless the student is looking for
loopholes in the men's laws, we cannot see where it
would harm him greatly and we can see whcrc it would
do much good in promoting the betterment of building
life If, at the coil of a semester's trial. the plan was
deemed to have failed. it could be discarded.

The charge is made by the men that strident govern—
ment is a tailure. They expect the nine inch composing
the Student Court to act as policemen and catch—me-if-
Tollvcun, The real trouble lies in the fact that the men’s
attitude toward student government is wrong. No gov
ernment works well when its people elect olficiais and
then refuse to carry out their part as citizens, This at:
titllde has changed within the lust lew years. The men
used to take an interest in the Court, but now, as soon
as the spring election takes place, the Court is forgotten
as tar as student cn-operntion is concerned.

The House Committee plan may not be tiic best in
the world, but We believe it would better present condir
tions. The hullse chairman and the Student Cuurt can-
not do everything themselves; they need this proposed
co-operation and they need student support. We would
like to see the matter brought up again at the house
meetings. It is not an attempt to pull the wool over
any one’s eyes and it deseri es the careful consideration
at the men R, E. Mc. l

Wlult improvements in student gov-

think that faculty government nould
lie nun-r successful?

Ralph firm The machinery which
has been set up for our present stllr
dent government is entirely adequate.
it needs the support and cooperation
of a more concerted student body to

ulty government as tried out is not as
successtul its the present system.

(‘I 'rc W ’IttiI think that if we
have any improvement, we should have
a system of house courts rather than
a iyﬁtelll of house cuinniinittoos with
no judicial power. Why not copy the
judicial system of the United states?

Clarence Jacobson — Some systeni
ought to be devised that would permit
every building on the campus to be
represented. No. The faculty should
act in an advisory Capacity.

Russell Gray—The actual structure

satisfactory. I consider the present
faculty government. t
Charles Fail — The present form
Seems satislncvtory, though its func- n

cooperation were possible, The sys-
tem now is better than faculty regula-
tion.

Sherman Allison 7 I would suggest
more law enforcing rather than more‘
law making. I hardly think that ab,

any more successful than our presentl
