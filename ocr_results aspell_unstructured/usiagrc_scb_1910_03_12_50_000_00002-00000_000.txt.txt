will entertain a large number or the
Colleges of the state at a ﬁeld meet
in May. This announcement has been
received “itll enthusiasm by Grinnell
students, who are unwilling to see the
old State Meet relegated to the past.

Such a meet will be a big undertalr
in; for Grinnell, but we are capable oi
handling it, ii the other schools 00‘
operate as we expect. The success
or the event means much to the luture
of track athletics.

Such happenings are too common to
merit editorial comment. Neither,
dignined Senior iriend. do we purpose
to make slightiug reterence to any
“developments" that may have orcui»
red during your college career.

We pass quickly over such haclr
neyed subjects in order to call your at-
tention (perhaps this is lulnecessal'l'l
to one that during the past week has
hecoine intensely more interesting

No doubt the mere suggestion itselr
is suriicient. We pay our most pro-
iound respects to the lilgllcl’ author-r
ties on the suhicrt, and trust that the
large attendance at the chapel
erases Illal‘ (olllllllle lllill llllillmtf’d
