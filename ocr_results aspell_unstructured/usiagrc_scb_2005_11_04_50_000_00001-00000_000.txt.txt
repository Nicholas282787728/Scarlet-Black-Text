New student

Nine initiatives, three from
SGA up for vote this Tuesday

'sv DAVID MONTGOMERY

Last spring, students submitted five initiatives,
ranging in topic from laundry to marijuana,forn cum-
pus Wide vote. None of the five initiatives received the
necessary 50 percent turnout and failed by default.

For this semester’s fall initiatives, SGA is bringing
back past methods or promotion, including tabling,
posters and an allrcampus mailing. With the Student
Campaign For increased Political Engagement (SCI—
PE), SGA will be putting on an open forum with inir
tiativc sponsors for students,

Members of the SGA Cabinet have also shown
drafts ofinitiatives to administrators, including Vice
President for Student Aﬁairs Tom Crady, seeking ins
put on how to make the initiatives more appealing to
administrators.

“I was always incredibly disappointed in the past,
because the initiatives always fell ﬂat on their face after
being passed," said SGA President John Bohman ’06.
“Part of the problem is oftentimes [the] adminis-
tration takes issue with the wording of the initiatives.
Sometimes there might be a weird technical error or
misleading word that makes them write it of .”

John Bohman’oe, preSIdent nal decisions
—— arc tip to the
students who
submit them. Malik met with Crady and Dick Wilt
liams, Dining Services, to show them drafts of ini-
tiatives. “[Crady] had mentioned that he was in-
terested in looking at all the initiatives and looking
at their wording," she said. “He was pretty impressed
with this year’s initiatives."

Students are aware when they submit initiatives
that there is an editing process, but were not told prior
to the meeting with Crady that administrators were
going to be involved.

Daniel Furuta ’08, who co-sponsored a resolution
calling tor better lighting on campus said the reviews
were reasonable since it was adminstrators “who
would be implementing th initiatives.”

Bohman said that initiatives complement and
support the regular work of SGA. “Initiatives are a
good way for us to check our own biases, making sure
that we aren't being misguided,”hc said.

A successful initiative can also help SGA when
talking to administrators, according to Bohman. “It
puts more weight on [an issue] if it comes from both
Joint Board and the student body,” he said.

The SCIFE event will be held on Monday, at a
time that has not yet been determined. Initiative votr
ing will open at midnight following the event.

Nine initiatives have been submitted. Eight of
them were backed by the constitutionallysrequired
minimum of 100 student signatures. One, calling {or
a darkroom, was added directly by SGA, which can
place one such initiative on the ballot each semestel:

Initiatives dealing with communitysservice funds
ing, Dining Dollar redistribution, Grab 8c Go in the
campus Center, jukeboxes in dining halls, campus
lighting and online registration will all be on Tues
day’s ballot. There will also be a 20 question survey
from SGA run in conjunction with the election

City Council candidates woo
student voters on campus

5v EMlLlA GARVEY

This year Grinnell's November election may not
draw national attention as did last year‘s, but there
will still be plenty ofirnportant decisions to make.

Three standing council members are running for
re—election against three challengers. All met in a
public meet-andrgtect in the Forum south Lounge
on Monday. Mayor Gordon Canfield was also pres
ent. The candidates came to discuss their stances on
important town issues.

Grinnell students who are registered voters will
be able to choose between 1st Ward incumbent
Peggy Elliot, a Yaleseducated lawyer who has been
on the council for 16 years, and opposing candidate
Oliva Wright, a child care provider who has lived in
Grinnell for 30 years. Students may also vote in the
councilpersonrat-large race, in which 20—year incum-
bent Jim White, owner of Bates
Flower Shop and mayor prostem
will run against Charlie Manly,
who was city attorney from 1978
to 2003.

Many Grinnell students have
been alive as long as some of the
candidates have served the city,
and may be puzzled about where
they lit into city council issues, Much of the talk on
Tuesday was about increasing economic vitality. Alr
most all the candidates agreed economic growth was
something in which college students actively particle
pate.

Both Elliot and White are on the Grinnell Res
naissance committee, which orchestrated the im-
provements to downtown streets. “We don't want our
town to look like any other town," Elliot said. “We
want downtown to survive [and to] prevail."

White spoke about how downtown needs to take
account ofarld provide for the needs ofstudents with
out cars and those of the Mayﬂower retirement comr
munity.“We may not be able to compete with malls,"
he said, "but we must create businesses for what poor
plc need."

”You don’t/Mir get an educallon
here, you alio help our rlly.”

City Council Candidate

First Ward candidate Wright was also conceined
with revenue that could help town ventures. “Every
time Grinnell College students fill up their gas tank
some of the tax goes to the town,” she said. "You don't
just get an education here, you also help our city.”

Candidates also debated how and where they
want money to be distributed and used. Atrlarge cans
didate Manly said that Grinnell should do more to
have democratic ﬁnance policies. “Why does White
feel that Grinnell should get involved with only one
bidder for city improvements?" he asked. “It concerns
me and I think it should change."

Third ward incumbent Shannon McNaul argued
that budget concerns were unjustified. She used as
an example of the decorative downtown brickwork,
which has been a subject of debate because some
Grinnell residents see them as superﬂuous. McNaul
said that the brickwork made up
eight percent of the roadwork cost,
and that a large committee had
decided on it during proceedings
that were open to the public.

Aside from ﬁscal and physis
cal improvements candidates were
asked to identify their most im-
portant issues. Elliot said that shc
was most concerned wtth forming a comprehensive
park plan and improving recycling. “I’m going to woik
on it ‘till l die,"slie said.

Wright also voiced her concern with maintaining
and improving park facilities. “I’m interested in safe
parks with sate equipment rot children,"she said. She
also wants to pursue a Grinnell water park to replace
the public pool,

Incumbent White identiﬁed his biggest conceln
as creating a vital downtown, while Manly identi-
fied his main concern is "why democracy evades city
council bidding.”

An ordinance on the local hotel tax, presently a
three percent rate would mcrcasc to seven percent.
The tax goes to pay for events that bring in revenue
