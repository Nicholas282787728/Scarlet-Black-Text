TO THE TEAM

The 1917 Grmneil Ioctbaii sqund is
deserving of the hlglieset praise, not
only because the mun Went 'thru the

cause they played the best football a
scarlet team has ever pl.,eti.

s grent thing. We are proud of it.

But even greater than [hat-Gi'iiiel

scarlet leairi hits become known rat-
and uirle as a unit which plays clean

They played a brainy gztnle. Com-

Concerning democraci- we believe
that there hits been a great deal or
favoritism ill the selection of non-
cumllllssiouetl oiricers. A large nlllni

lien or the sergeants and eurporztls are

ireslllnen cud sophomores who have
had no previous inilltziry.train‘.ng.
We think that these ohlcers should
bu chosen primnriiy in regard or their
military training, and other things
being equal, upper classmen should
be gll'ou the preterence. This is not
because seniors are better than fresh-
men, but because the underclassmen
will hnrc their opportunities latter.

These suggestions are not entirely
our own, but represent the opinions
or many others -——T\\'o Privates.
