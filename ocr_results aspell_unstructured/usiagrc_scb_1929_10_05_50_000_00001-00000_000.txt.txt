Pioneers Play
Iowa State in

Battle Today

Are Crippled by Loss of
Rose, Mclntire‘ and
Ruff to Team.

Thomas New Star

Deve10ps Into Accurate Passer;
Hidden-ball Plays Use
Douglas, Rickey.

When Grinnell took to the gridiron
at Ames this afternon in the annual
Grinnellrlowa State college football
game, three Pioneer regulars were ob-
‘sent from the starting lineup, if word
given out by Coach L. i... wait ye's-
terday held true.

Captain Harold Rose and Ernest
McIntire were due to witness the
game from the bench as a result of
injuries received against Penn a week
ago. Russell Ruff was the third Scar.
let and Black gridder scheduled not to
start against the Cyclones. He was
absent on account of a charley-horse
which also was responsible for his
failure to participate in the Penn tilt.
All these men were likely to break
into the lineup if needed, however, as
Coach Watt had set his heart on an—
nexing today’s game.

Despite the fact that these three
veterans will not he in the opening
lineup, Watt expected to put an of-
fensive on the field that would be-
wilder the heavier Cyclone team.
Working fast and well timed hidden-
ball plays around Richey and Doug-
las, he has a running attack that
will be hard to stop. Henry
Thomas has shown himself to be
just about as good at the ball tossing
business as the star of 1928. Russell
Ruff. Thomas isn’t quite as accur-
ate as the ottumwa star but his
passes are faster and succeed nearly
as often.

Thomas was due for a heavy work—
out today for McIntire is in no shape
to play, Hank suffered some rather
stiff punishment last week himself
and will probably be scheduled to go
the entire distance. Liedtke has
been geting some practice at calling
signals during the past week, how-
ever, and may be called in if assistr
ance is needed.

Brlggs and Hutu at Ends

Briggs and Biito are the Pioneer
starters at the ends and Coach Watt
planned to Start Klinefelter and
Walker at tackles. Tlpton played
well against Penn but has been both—
ered with a stomach ailment. He
will probably be given a chance at
the Cyclones during the game, how<
ever.

Heldridge has 'been shifted from
guard to center and Parish and
Christoffersen will be the starters at
guards. Thomas is scheduled for
quarter, Richey and Lledtke at
halves and Douglas will fill in for
Rose at fullback.

Although Coach Watt has given
his men some good plays for a run-
ning attack, it will probably he an
aerial game which will pull out a
victory for Grinnell. in a scrim~
mage against the frosh eleven Wed-
nesday night the Pioneer aggrega—
tion unloaded a series of heaves such
as have never before been seen on
the gridiron here. They fell at all
angles and were usually good. If the
plays work against Iowa state the
Cyclones will be due for a touch
time.

was held last evening in the Men's
gymnasium, for which the Missis-
sippi Six played. Dean Beatty, Miss

Sculpture", “A Visit to the Fifteenth
Century," and "Michel Angelo."

lecture course in previous years at the
chiversity of Iowa and at many other
schools in this part of the country.
Last February, he presented "An
Hour in o. Sculptors Studio" at the
chapel. He illustrated his lecture by
modeling in clay.

“His lectures will be one of the
treats of recent lecture courses," said

Marquette Tilt
Next Saturday

Golden Avalanche Will Try
to Retrieve Defeat of

Last Year.

Next Saturday, October 12, the
Grinnell pioneers will invade the
Marquette stadium determined to
turn back the Golden Avalanche as
they did successfully on the home
held last year. Football fans will
recall the game last fall when Grin-

opened up with a spectacular passing
attack in the last half to defeat
Marquete, 20 to 13,

This game will he the fourth meet
ing of the two schools. Grinneii has
taken two of the three previous
games, winning in 1926 by a score of

in 1927, and winning on the home
ﬁeld in 1923 by 20 to 13.

‘Ting-a-Ling’ of Telephone Holds
Mystery for Grinnell Prep Co-Eds

Ting. ing—a—lingl Tingrarling-a-
ling: No music ever sounded sweeter
to human ears than does the tele-
phone bell to a group of Grinnell
freshman co—eds. Youthful hearts
beat just a trifle faster as their own-
ers fail over trunks and boxes in a
mad scampcr down the long hall to
the telephone.

Around the victor in the race an
anxious bodyguard forms and awaits
the fateful moment when the un-
known caller will reveal his purpose
and his name. The receiver is off
the hook; the voice is cleared: the
tremuious “hello" spoken before the
college central has completed the
connection or the caller is on the
line.

“Mary, oh, Mary Smith!" A die-
appointed chorus of "abs" and "ahs"
breaks from the lips of every one but
lucky Mary, who with a squeal of

 

 

delight edges toward the phone.

“He lives in the dormsl"

"He's on the team! Don’t you re-
member he played the last quarter
Saturday?"

“No, he's a senior and house chair—
man."

Thus the wild guesses uttered in
scarcely concealed undertones.

Gasps and giggles mingled with
the roar of the ever—near M. and St.
L. give color to the conversation
which threatens to prolong itself into
minutes. As time goes on the
scholarly ones depart, but still an
excited few remains.

At last the date is made, and to
the eager questions of the girls
around her, Mary, with sophisticated
shrug and nonchalant look, replies:
“His name? I don’t remember. One
meets so MANY men, you know—"
