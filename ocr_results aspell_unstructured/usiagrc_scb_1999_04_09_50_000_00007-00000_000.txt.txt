Dear [Grinncll College srudcms],

l have read and rhoughr abour rhe rwo resolurions rhar you presenrcd ro
me in from ofNollen House on Thursday, March ls. lhave, in addirion,
read a large number ofc—mails from srudenrs, a number ofwhich disagree

-wirh rhe posirions srarcd in rhe SGA resolurions. Finally, l have now re-
ceived a number ofaddirional Fund for Excellence proposals for rhe cur-
renr cycle including a major proposal ro improve rhe college's rechnology
infrasrrucrure in ways rhar will benefir srudenrs, faculry, and sraff

Frindfor Escellence Proposal

The Fund for Excellence proposal, which seclo remporary funding for
rwo addirional posirions in srudenr affairs for rhe eo g budger year and
was submirred by Emilie Beavers and John Aerni, was rhe hrsr proposal I
received for rhc second round ofrhe Fund process. i plan ro consider all

such proposals as ourlined in my memorandum ro rhe campus afrer rhe_

submission deadline, April 9. As I have said in rhe pasr, rhe Fund for Exc:lr
lence is designed ro enhance srrarcgically rhc College. Ir is nor an alrerna.
rive vehicle for permanenr, baseebudgel expendirures. i believe char borh of
rhcse posirions are curicnrly such erpendirures and rhe proposal makes clear
rhar you agree. lalso rhink ro re-fund rhem ar rhis momenr would be ro
prevenr Srudcnr Affairs from following rhrough on a reorganizarlon d:—
signed ro meer rhe evolving needs ofsrudenrs. No office in rhc College can
be immune from budger prudence and no ofﬁce is ever frozen, including
Srudenr Affairs which has changed and will coniinue ro change over rime.

Ar rhc same rime, in connecrion wirh rhe opening of rhe Fine Arrs
Cenrer, we had decided ro creare an experimenral posirion for coordinaring
campus evenrs. More speciﬁcally, rhe person filling rhis posirion would
assisr in scheduling evenrs, including booking groups and programs, in rhe
Fine Arcs Ccnrer and rhroughour campus. Afrer having spoken ro Torn
Crady, we plan rhar some of rhe work formerly done by Lisa Marye, Direc-
ror ofsrudenr Acriviries, would be underrakcn by rhis new person. i am
confidenr drar rhe person hired ro perform rhe job could assisr SGA and
Grinnell srudenrs ar large in organizing srudenr acriviries. The resr ofLisa’s
job is covered, Tom believes, in his reorganizarion plan.

As ro rhe RLC program, we believe rhar six RLCs should be able meer
rheneeds ofoursrudenrs.Thisisasolid program widi srrongsraffand Tom
Crady will keep an eye on ir.

Student Memirrriip 071 rlar Campus Bridgerddrirzzy Climmittz:

,Your second resolurion is a request rhar rwo srudenrs, named by SGA,
sir as members on die Campus BudgcrAdvlsory Commirree. As you know,
in my discussion of rhcsc issues, I suggesrcd rhar I would like more srudenr
inpur inro our budgering processes. This re rrue. However, rhe campus
Bridger Advisory Commirree is an advisory body ro rhe presidenr and ihe
Treasurer wirh respecr ro a range of budger issues ar rhe highesr level of
absrracrion. Simply pur, represenrarion of many dilferenr groups on rhe
Budger Advisory Commirree has never been a pan of campus governance.
in facr, campus enriries, such as rhe Library, rhe Admissions office, rhe
Faculry Erecurive council, rhe office ofAlumni and D'evelopmenr, and
many orhers have never had a represenrarive on rhe Budger Commirrce.
Barber, rheir budgcrary inreresrs and prioriries are made known direcriy ro
me or rhe Treasurer before and during rhe budger process. To adopr a rep.
resenrarional model Campus Budger Advisory Comminee membership
would be ro change irs funcrion. perhaps rhis is worrhy offurrher consider.
arion. My own view ar rhis rime is rhar no represenrarional model can work
for mis commirree because irs role is co advise on rhe largesr overall budger
objecrives and issues and nor ro discuss or arrempr ro sifr rhe derail ofeach
year’s budger proposal.

As an alrernarive, I chink rhar SGA, rhrough che acrion ofirsJoinr Board
or a new budgering commirree such as I describe below, should direcriy
inreracr wirh Srudenr Affairs and mm me duringth early fall by idcnrlfyr
ing budger ideas, prioriries, and proposals. in rhis respecr, SGA, like every
orher campus enriry, will parricipare in rhc process by which needs are as-
sessed, priorirics esrablished, and choices made.

More specifically, i drink ir would be helpful roghe office of scudenr ,

Affairs, me, and rhe enrire budgering process ifSGA formed a cornmlrree
on budger and planning, This commirrce, wirh which i would be glad ro
rneer, would perform several funcrions. Firsr, ir should scrurinize SGA’s
own budgering pracrices, which have been rhe subjeci ofsignifieanr criii.

denrs. i would leave ro you and your colleagues rhe issue ofwherher ihc

Any srudcnr budger commirree muse face, like any adminisrraror faces,
rhe facr rhar nor all choices can be addirive. In rhis year’s budger we added,
as you know: 1) a new person in CDO, following a srudenr referendum on
rhis, 2) increased ro —rime one ofour chaplains and rwo supporr people in
scudenr Affairs, 3) signiﬁcantly increased srudenr wages in response ro nu-
merous srudcnr commencs ro me, 4) liberalized financial aid prospecrively
in several ways rhar srudenrs have soughr, 5) increased funding for diversiry
inlriarives in pair as rhe rcsulr ofsuggesrions by Perar and orhers in sGA, 6)
launched a masrcr plan process largely driven by srudenr needs in rhe areas
oforganizarional and acriviry space and also living, recrearion, and library
space, and 7) signiﬁcanrly increased funding for reehnology upgrades aimed
ar rhe srudenr side ofour rcchnology infrasrrucrurc. None ofrhese rhings
arc eosrless; all are addilivc; and all responded direcriy ro srudenr inlriarives
and requcsrs, many reinforced by 36A.

Thank you all for your commiimenr and hard work on behalfofcrinnell.

issues in rhe co g weeks and monchs. We are ar a crirical juncrurc in plan»

Russell l<, Osgood

 

To rhe Campus Community:

We, rho SGA Cabincr, wish ro address Fresidcnr Russell K. Osgood’s
response ro rhe hivo resolurions passed by Joinr Board before spring Break.
We would addirionally like ro make our posirion known ro campus regard«
ing rhc overall issue ofadminisrrarive accounrabiliry ro srudenrs. in order ro
do ibis,wc will ﬁrst ouilinc rhc speciﬁc evenrs rhar rranspircd rlfccr rhe news
ofrhe eliminarion ofone RLC posirion and rho Direcror ofsiudenr Activis
ries,

The news rhar rhcse rwo posirions were nor being rchircd was never
ofﬁcially released by rhc adminisrrarion ro rhe srudenr body; in facr, cable
ncr was never rold, Once Cabiner was aware ofrhe siruanon from word of
mourh, we invircd Tom crady and Dave clay ro arrend Joinr Board and
answer qucslions abour rhc changes. over 100 srudcnrs were presenr rhar
evening, bur despire rhis show ofconcern, she decision ro rcsrrucrure sin.
denr Affairs had already been made. lr was suggcsred riiar cabiner discuss
rhe marrer wirh presidcnr Osgood Ar our meenng wiih rhe Presidenr, he
showed an inrcrcsr in more srudenr inpui in rhe college’s budgering process
and suggesred rhar rwo srudenrs sir on rhe Budgerary Advisory Commiirce.
This led us ro believe rhar he would appreciare and consider siudeni upln»
ion when making decisions rhar direcriy affeci our lives. Afrer rhis meering,
a Fund for Ercellence proposal was drafred by Emilie Beavers and John
Aerni ro fund rhese posirions for one year unril rhey could be refunded
‘permanenrly wirhin rhe limirs ofrhe base budgcr. An Open Forum was held
wirh Russell Osgood, Tom crady, and Dave clay, which well over 200 Sm»
denrs arrended. srudenr frusrrarion only increased in response ro rhe appar.
enr furihry of rho proresrs. Ar Joinr Board rhe following Wednesday, [we
resolurions were passed mandaring rhe appoinrmenr ofrhe srudenrs and rhe
funding ofrhe proposal. li was decided ar rhar rime rhar srudenrs would nor
srage a formal proresr. We delivered rho resolurion ro Bresidenr Osgood and
sripulared rhar he answer immediarelyfollowing break. i—lis r'csponse came
in rhe form ofa Iericr ro Ferar Klacisch, Emilie Beavers, John Aerni and
Vivekvenugopal, which was carbon copied ro rhc 8&5, lfrhe campus com-
rnuniry was io receive ir in a more rimcly manner, Cabiner would osrensibly
carry rhar responsibiliry.

cabiner is planning rhe following responses ro presidenr Osgood's leirer.
Firsr, we are presenring our opinions ro campus rhrough rhrs lerrer. Ferar
will erpress our concerns wirh rhe siruarion ro alumni in an Alumni office
newslerrer. Finally, Perar and Jess Dvorak will prescnr srudenr concerns ro
rhe Trusree commirree on Srudenr Life.

cabiner would like ro respond ro several of Presidenr Osgood’s main
polnlsz

in his lerrer, l>residenr Osgood wrires rhar he believes funding rhe posic
rions will “preveni Srudenr Affairs from following rhrough on a reorganizac
rion designed ro meci rhe evolving needs ofsrudenrs." Obviously ifsrudenrs
felr rhis change would meer our needs, we would nor be upser. Also, his
choice nor ro fund rho posinons ranks a reorganizaiion plan as more impor.
ranr rhan rhe srudenr concerns Joinr Board deliberared and vored upon,
Previously rhe justiﬁcation for rhe reorganizarion was rhe need co operarc
wirhin rhe consrrainrs of rho College’s budger. We agree rhar rhc Fund for
Excellence is nor an “alrernarivc frinding vehicle for permancnr, base budger
expenditures." However, we nore rhar several permanenr posirions are in
facr being funded by rhe FFE. This inconsisrency invalidarcs his argumenr

Deal EdlKOr:

Ovcr rhe pasr rwo weeks, i have been involved in rho dialogue abour rhc
ellrninarion of rho rwo Srudenr Affair’s posirions and agree rhar riiey are
going ro direcriy affecr our lives on mmpus next year. Afrer rhe meenngs
with Tom crady lasr weck and you lasr nighr, ir seems ro me rhar rhere arc
srudenrs who don't undersrand whar rhe big deal is and don'r see why rhere
has been such an ourcry. Then more are arc rhose who see rhrs as yer anorher
way in whichsrudenr needs are bcing ignored for rhe sake ofrhe mysrerious,
impencrrable budger and chc direcrron in which rhis college is being raken.

lcame [O Grlnncll because I‘ believed in what it SIDDd for. I cam: for the
self.governance, the curriculum, and rhe openness. During my firsr year,
rhar openness manifesred irselfin me being able ro meer wirh adminisrra.
rors, faculry, and even Frcsidenr Ferguson co ralk abour issues rhar l felr
srrongly abour. Since rhen, my feeling abour rhis college have changed,

Beginning wirh rhc secrerivc and sudden deparrure ofFresidenr Ferguson,
lsrarred ro realize lhal somerhing was changing. We have all speculared as
ro why she lefr, Whar we have seen since her deparrure is a change in rhe
vision ofwhar crinnell isand where ir isgoing. Whar is frusrraringsrudenrs
is rhe facr rhar rhese changes seem ro be oecuring wirhour rhe inpur ofrhe
srudenrs rhcmselves. Whar we see is a college rhar has doubled irs endow-
menr since our freshman year, a college char wanrs ro head in a new direc.
rion, and a presideni who was chosen ro implemenr rhis new direcrion for
rhe Trusrces. The quesrion srudenrs ask is, did anyone ever ask rile srudenrs
whar ii is abour Crlnncll rhar made chem come here and whar makes ir such
a special plan:? And why does rhls college seem ro be going in a direcrion
rhar srudenrs don’r generally want?

I undersrand rhar rhis college suddenly has a lor ofmoney and has rhe
porenrial ro be ranked wirh rhe besr colleges in rhis counrry. Bur l rumed
down ivy League schools because I believed rhar rhis was rhe cnvironmenr i
wanrcd. ldidn‘rwanr ro go ro a collegelikeSwarrhmore arAmllcalsL lfrhe
goal of rhc Trusrees is ro make us more like rhese schools, we are going ro
lose rhe rhings rhar have made Grinnell rhe unique learning environmenr
rhar it is.

The issue here is nor really abour rhe eliminarion of RLc’s and orher
sraff. The issue is accounrabiliry, lfrhcrc is one rhing Grinnellians do nor
like, iris secrerive acrion. Underlying all ofrhis is rhe feeling rhar rhere is an
agenda for rhis college, one rhar we do nor have conrrol of. We wanr ro
know rhc vision ofrhe presidenr and Trusrces, Our school seems ro be chang
ing righr before us and lr is making srudenrs feel disillusioned and quiered.

Those srudenrs who don'l undersrand rhar rhe RLC issue is iusr parr of
rhe larger picrure do nor see ihar rhis college is heading in a differenr dim:—
rion and rlrere are small sreps being raken ro crearc a differenr Grinnell,

\ch wanr communicarion We wanr ro know why rhese rhings are being
done, And we don'r wanr rhe mysrenous, lmpenenablc budger as an excuse
for rhese acrions. The Grinncll i came ro changing. My queslion ro rhis
campus is wherher or nor you are going ro sir bade and lee rhese changes
happen wirhour your voice being heard.
