Classics Series

In keeping with me philosophy that
cinema should uplift the mind as well as
the spirit, the series entitled “Classics of
World Cinema’ is to dominate this
semester's film schedule. Each weekend,
a film of truly extraordinary caliber and
historical merit will be shown, beginning
this weekend with Orson Welles’ classic
masterpiece citizen Kane.

Produced, written, and directed by Dr
son Welles, Kane is the story of a
somewhat ruthless, all too capitalistic
newspaper editor who dies filthy rich but
totally unloved. Sound familiar? Indeed, it
should as the film is the American
dream/nightmare captured on celluloid,
Welles stars as the millionaire, newspaper
tycoon, Charles Foster Kane, who at the
film’s outset mutters, “Rosebud" and
dies, This final utterance then becomes the
locus of the film — an attempt by newsreel
makers to discover the meaning of
“Rosebud." The film consists of
flashbacks to Kane’s childhood and career
finally reaching the conclusion that for all
his innumerable wealth and power, Kane
was ultimately unable to buy the one thing
in life that truly matters, love,

Since its premiere on May 1. 1941,
Citizen Kane has become the topic of much
critical discussion. Because the picture is
loosely based on the life of William Ran-
dolph Hearst, its shooting was shrouded in
secrecy and intrigue. The iilm has never
failed to intrigue its viewers. Reviewers of
Citizen Kane have always been prone to
Superlatives and I am no exception. The
impact and inﬂuence the film has had both
on the movie making and the movie going
world cannot be denied. N0 ‘series in
cinema or cinema technique would be
complete without a screening of Citizen
Kalle. To presume knowledge of films
without having seen Citizen Kane is a pom-
pous and unjustified presumption indeed,

 

Soviet Cinema

in 1925, Soviet audiences saw what
Mikhail Koltsov wrote in Pravda was “the
first revolutionary creation of our
cinema". More than thirty years later, Jay
Leyda called Strike “the first
revolutionary-mass film”. The initial work
of celebrated Soviet director, Sergei
Eisenstein, Strike is the beginning of a
series of Soviet cinema coming to Grinnell
campus. Also included are four other ex-
amples of early Soviet filmmaking spann-
ing from 1925 to 1931.

The film series is being sponsored by the
Russian and East European Studies Coma
mittee as part oi a yearlong Special
Events Series. Some of the activities
scheduled for later in the year is a showing
of Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible, Part One
and Two, accompanied by a lecture entitl-
ed “How Terrible Was lvan the Terrible? ”
delivered by Daniel Kaiser, chairmen of
the committee and Assistant Professor of
History. The showing will commemorate
the quadricentennial anniversary of Ivan
the Terrible’s death,

Although the films were scheduled in
conjunction with Mr. Kaiser and Mr.
Mohan’s eight credit course on Modern
Russian Society and Culture, Mr. Kaiser
encouraga everyone to see the films
because they not only serve as excellent
examples at early cinema, but they also oi-
fer insight into Soviet life during the twen-
ties which Mr, Kaiser describes as “an ex-
ceptional decade".

Mr. Kaiser wanted to make the films
available to the academic and extra-
curricular programs as well as the college
community at large. However, uncertain
about attendance, Mr. Kaiser scheduled
the series in ARH 115 instead of South
Lounge in order to avoid many empty
Seats. The films will be shown twice.

 

 

 

French Festival Continues ,

Starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and
leaturing Charles Boyer, Stavisky 150116 of
Alain Resnais' most visually stunning
films, Set in 1933, it recounts the climactic
days in the career of a conrman turned in-
ternational finanmer. Vincent Canhy.
Writing in the New York Times Said, “AS a
gentleman among gangsters and a
gangster among gentlemen, Jeaanaul
Belmondo is at his best,” John Simon calla
ed the iilm “elegant" and pointed out that
Resnals analyzes not only the
“megalomania of his central figure, but,
also, the society and period that allowed
him to flourish."

With the quality of the film established,
we draw attention to the fact that it is one
of two Resnais films in the series. The
other. Last Year at Marienbad, will be
screened next week. The two were selected
for the comparisons and contrasts which
viewers will be able to draw from them, as
well as for their individual merits.

In general, the films are very different,
Marienhad, controversial when it was
released in 1961, all but abandons the con
cept of linear plot and places stress on sub
jective interpretation of reality. The imr
age is surrealistic. Stravisky, on the other
hand, is probably Resnais' most realistic,

a‘cces’sible film. But the differences, major ,

as they are, do not represent basic changes
in the director's work as much as they
underscore his versatility, and, in many
respects, the director of stavisky is, still,
the director of Marienbad. Resnais has
always been preoccupied with the ways in
which his films associate past, present and
future, This is as true in Stavisky as it is in
Marienbad, and in both films, Resnals'
broad brush, his texture, his lavish set-
tings and his bold approach are present,

Marienbad was hailed by many as
Resnais’ crowning achievement. “Where
will you go from here?” he was asked. “I
will go on,” he replied. He has gone on to
other great iilms but the image of Marien-
bad persists, It is as Truffaut said of his
own lilms: “too many people saw The 400
Blows; not enough saw Shoot the Piano
Player.“

The differences and similarities between
Marieilbad and Stavisky are too numerous
to recount, The viewer must assimilate -.
them for himself. He must see Stavisky,
see Marienbad, and, then, think back to
stavisky. in doing so he will come to ap-
preciate, even, perhaps to understand the
directorial style of Alain Reenais. . . ,

The Russian and East European Studies
Committee has purchased strike and plans
to buy one title a year in hopes of building a
library of Soviet cinema which encom-
passes dltierent genres and eras.

Although all five films depict Soviet life
in the twenties and how the 1917 Revolution
affected and influenced this life, each film
does this through different techniques,
styles, and loci.

Released in 1925, Strike ushered in a new
period of Soviet cinema. It depicts the
development of a strike in Czar-is! Russia
and the eventual slaughter of the collec-
tivized workers. It is one of the best ex-
amples oi the mass or epic revolutionary
films.

Abram Room's Third Meshchanskaya
(Bed and Sofat explores the severe hous-
ing shortage in Moscow during the twenr
ties through the simple story of a couple
who allow a friend to share their already
crowded apartment, The film made public
the moral license of the twentia.

Both The End of St. Pctershurg, directed
by Vsevolod Pudovkin in 1927, and October
(Ten Days that Shook the World), directed
by Eisenstein in 1928, were made to come
memorate the tonal anniversary of the
1917 Revolution. Although both depict the
events which lead up to the Revolution,
Pudovkin focuses on one central character
while Eisenstein presents a broad over-
view or the happenings in Petrograd bet-
ween February and October or 1917.

Dziga Vertov's first sound film, En-
thusiasm, Symphonie of the Don Basin,
shows the miners of the Don Coal Basin
and their struggles to complete their part
of the First Five-Year Plan, The film's
memorable soundtrack is blended and
mixed from music, machinery noises,
radio excerpts, documentary recordings,
and workers‘ voices.
