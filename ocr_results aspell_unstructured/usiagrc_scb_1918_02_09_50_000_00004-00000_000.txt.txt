GHRlSTWNFRANGE

Visits Little Church and Hears a
Uniformed Priest Tell the
Story to Soldiers

Jolili ii. Smith, termer 'nstructor in
irrcneh at Gl‘ulilell. who now with
the aiuinilnntc corps. "somewhere in
Front - has written a letter deseriu
ing his eelehration or Christmas eve
at a midnight mass in a little nilt-of~
the n village church hehind the dr-
ing line,

The tollowing paragraphs were to-
hun trom‘ a letter written in French to
Prof. Caroline Sheldon.

By John M. Smith

it was just striking eleven when we
set out, my two comrades and I, to-
ward the village nearest our Canton»
merit in the heart or a sheltering val-
ley. We had hnrely reached the top
of the ﬁrst hill when the chimes ut
the neighhoimg villages hogan to peal
iortli trose crystalline notes so ehar-
acteristic or old hells.

Once outside the valley we hastened
breathless across the snow and ice. At
our leit, tar. away in a sister valley,
lay the village or , whose win-
dows, despite the army
and regardless oi possilile hoche avi—
ators, were all allame, sending out
thei- challenge to the alitLChrisLmds
sp oi the enemy.

itonds Are Crowded

Ordinarily the roads are empty of
pedestrians at that hour of the night;
hut that evening there were many per--
sons, chieny in “horizon" color, almost
in\iSlble even in the moonlight, whose
joyous country songs, raised [orth
with all the strength or the smgers‘
lungs. announced their presence as
they Callie'fl‘um all dil'ccllolis toward
their common goal.

When we arrived, the church was
crowded almost to its capacity. chieﬂy
with men in liotlzunvgray. Tall tapers
were hur rig on the high altar; mass
had already hegun. ,From the hack
came the trnkle of the altar—hell tale
lowed immediately by the husky voicc
ot the old priest, kneeling before the
altar, attended Liv two little aeolytes.

Priest in Ull tirill

,Theli another priest in the uniiorm
of a stretcher hear-er told the stoi

oi ,the manger, and the Child "horn in
tire City of David," as ’_ii he were telle
ing it to a group at children; and reale
ly there were many among his hearers
who had the childlike soul. 1 never
saw a company or children listen with
more eager attention to the story of
the Christ Child, it was really a most
moving sight, this or those soldiers
listening forgetful ot the dangers oi
war, and or the fact that a shell might
drop in on them at any moment, lise
tening to and helieving that ancient
story which has survived the passage
or o many centuries, and so many
war -

Toward one, o'clock the “inisszt esL”
was pronounced We went out, toe
ward our places in the trenches and
cantonmenls~slleltcrs dug out in the
hillsidesethinkiug, douotless, of the
children at home who were setting out
their liox s o their little wooden shoes
hetore the ti cpluee where “Father
Christmas" would he sure to ﬁnd them.
