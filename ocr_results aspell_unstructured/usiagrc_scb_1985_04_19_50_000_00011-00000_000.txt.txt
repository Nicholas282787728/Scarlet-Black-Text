one example that comes to mind is
that oi the policies ol the lowa Depart-

ment of Transportation concerning ,

drivers licenses. It is iacmating to me
that Iowa has gone to the trouble of
creating a Spanish language “rules oi
the road.” but that in doing so. has pro-
vided the Spanish community with such
an incredible piece at trash, The
Spanish translation is about two dozen
pages long, while the standard copy is
well over one hundred pages long. The
standard copy has big, beautiful, color
pictures of all the road signs, while the
Spanish copy has miniscule, hand
drawn signs in black and white. To
v compound the inequity, the Spanish
translation is missing most of the signs
' that are included in the standard copy.
Furthermore, the language in the
Spanish copy is so atrocious that it is all
4 but impossible to understand,
Assuming one can actully make their
- way through the translation, then they
go to take the test which is divided in
' two parts: written and practical.
‘ Nobody at the testing lane speaks Sp—
anish, but there is a Spanish copy of
t the written exam, It too is illegible for
all intents and purposes. it too is writ-
« ten in such a manner that it is highly
confusing. And it too is in black and

white. while the English translation is
in color. As it that weren’t suilicient,
the Spanish translation of the exam has
nearly twice as many questions as is
English counterpart.

The practical is just as degrading, for
there are no staff members at the licen-
sing building that speak Spanish.
Translators aren’t allowed to accom»
pany their clients in the auto, and thus,
the Hispanics oi Des Moines rarely
have licenses. All the same they drive.
They have to in order to work. So they
end up getting ticketed often for driving
without a license and told it would all be
much easier it they would just study up
and get the license. Back to square one.

So what is it that. can be done to
change people‘s attitude toward uns
cared for minorities. Really it is not so
important which minority is being
discussed. Blacks get similar treat-
ment as Hispanics in this system.
Women feel it too. Token recognition or
abidence of laws only because they are
laws is insufficient. The change which
is necessary is personal to everybody in
that it can’t come from laws, from the
outside. It must come from within.
What does it take to sincerely admit to
yourself that another man or woman is
just like you are? 15 that such a threat?

to assist the young Mexican woman and
her two children. One other kids, the
youngest. is an “American” citizen:
