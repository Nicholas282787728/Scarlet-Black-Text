Genius Comes From Imagination,
Philosopher Says In Final
Memorial Lecture.

TELLS MYSTIC EXPERIENCE

Mysticism Has No Contention with
Seances or Table Rapping,
Jones Declares.

"There is no rational activity of
any sort which the deep suh~soil oi
the soul does not influence, and the
human race has discovered many
ways to let this sub-soil emerge,” Dr.
Rufus M. Jones, professor of pllil»
use by of Havertord college, told

us laymen and ministers. stu-
dents and faculty members, in speak-
ing on "inspiration as a Way to
Truth and Reality" as the fifth and
concluding address of the 1929 George
A. Gates Memorial lectures yesterday
morning in Herrick chapel.

Dr. Jones opened the series of five
memorial lectures, or which the
general theme was “The Quest for
God," by talking in a long chapel
Tuesday on “Spiritual Energies By
Which We Live,” At Wednesday's
chapel he spoke on "The Approach of
Faith," Thursday's on "Tile Divine
and the Human," Thursday night on
"The Testimony of the Mvstic" and
yesterday morning on uinspiration as
a Way to Truth and Reali , Presi-
dent J. H. T. hiain introduced Dr.
Jones at all of the chapel hour ad-
dresses.

Two types of people who are great-
ly responsible for the bringing out oi
this subsoil are the poets and mys-
tics. "The specific genius of a poet
lies in imagination." declared Dr.
Jones.

The speaker stressed the fast that
imagination was nothing other than
creative genius, which in turn was a
duplicate for subsoil wealth, This
scrcalletl sub-soil wealth is always
displayed by an inspiration. “Inspile
etion comes as a surprise. as a divine
splendor, to release create energy,‘
he said, citing the high amount of
inspired literature poetry which the
world now possesses,

In his concluding remarks of ad
nurztion for Grinnell he said: “I
have lost my heart to this town and
this college. and especially to the
group of people who have been com-
ing here to meet me. i am going home
thrilled and encouraged."

Meets Mysticism
In College

The Testimony of a Mystic was the
content of Dr. Rufus Jones' fourth
Gales Memorial lecture in Herrick
chapel Thursday evening. Dr. Jones,
who has been interested in Mysticism
since he was It college student, made
it clear that the word mysticism has
no connection whatever with the
Word mysterious. It has nothing to
do with table rapping, scances, or, in
general, ghostly things. Mysticism is.
however, according to Dr. Jones, an
cverniastering conviction that actual
Contact is achieved With the divine.

"We believe many things about the
external world which we have never
had any experience about," the lecr
had any experience with," the let--
turer remarked, Mysticism involves

Drake Is Second Amer ”Break”
In Mile Relay Race ;
Antes Wins.

Beginning the track season last
night by barely losing to Drake for
third place in the annual triangular
meet with Drake and Ames, the Pin-
neer cinder men showed promise of
developing into one of the most fills
round track teams Grillnell has had
in years. Ames won the meet with
37 points while Drake and Grinnell
trailed with 22 1-2 and 2b 172
spectively,

The two point margin for Drake
came as a “break" in thc mile relay
when Grinnell led with Drake run
plug in third place for tllreeequarters
of the way. As McKee, running an-
chor tar Gr-innell fell back into sec-
ond place the Ames runner ran wide.
As the Pioneer runner tried to pass
him he fell and lost his baton. Al-
though Grinnell won the event. Drake
was given two extra points for taking
second after Ames had been disqualt
fled.

When Hensley took second in the pole
vuult and Golz placed in the broad
jump for Grinnell, chances for inak~
ing a showing in the field events in
later meets this year seemed to ins
crease while, for the first time in
years, a Grinnell man placed in the
half mile as Edwards, running for
the first time in college competition,
came up in the last lap to pass several
runners and push the leaders in the
race.

Beck placed third in the fifty yard
dash as Parks, sensational Drake
sprinter who placed in the Texas ree
lays and various other leading meets
last year, failed to qualify.

Hagger, an Ames sophomore, won
both hurdle races, setting a new rec-
ord in the highs and tying the present
one in the lows. Taylor of Grinnell
made a good showing but failed to
display the term of last season.

The Grinnell sound was handicap-
pcd as ilcCully, circaptain of the
track team, and lngram, a pair of out
standing performers in field events
were missing, both being on the has»

Library Gift To Make Latest Books
Available to Grinnell Student Body

Within a week, Grinnell students
will be able to obtain the most re-
cent and best books, both fiction and
nonfiction, This is in effect, what the
library announced today, when the es—
tablishment of a rental collection of
February 22 was made public.

The collection, which will consist of
fifty hooks, twenty-five [lN‘
twenlyrflve non—fiction, is the gift of
Mr J. H. Smith and daughters of
Grumell in memory of lilabel Ann
Smith, who graduated in the class of
1904. It will include almost entirely
books published last year- or this year.
A fee of two cents a. dily will. be
charged for each book taken out. and
the profits from this rental system
will go into a general fund for buying
additional books to add to the collec-
tion.

It has been felt for some time that
to h. 'e such a fund would be a step
forward. for up to the present it has
been impossible to fill the popular
demand for recent books, ZIS the li-
brary funds are devoted primarily to
purchasing reference or departmental
books. For many of the must desir~
ed works, a, wa' ‘ng list up to th

Tile list of books which will be

Each of the staff made out the list
of books which represented her per—

The mystic has not yet testified as
to why Grinnell only made three
field goals against Drake when the
Pioneer eagers played at Des aloiues
on Jan, 11. but it is reasonable to
expect that the Bulldogs cannot turn
the trick again and. with this in
mind, fans are looking to the Grille
nell»Drake contest, the final conferr
cnae engagement for the Pioneers, as
a major event next Wednesday night.

It might not be amiss to recall to
those with weakened memories the
tale which appeared Jan. 12
carryin . the 32 to 12 score
by which the Bulldogs steallie
rollered Grihnell, since that time
there has been nothing to warrant the
unseemlng count and there is no rea-
son te believe that the Pioneer rep:
resentation of cagers cannot at least
make a respectable showing against
their time honored rivals.

Drake lost to Creighton by a great-
er margin than did Crinncll. Succumb»
ing to Marquette by a single point and
failing to register with any great ac
curacy against Washington U. G
nell has made a showing just as good
in games against other teams and
should be able to lose its stage fright
against Drake.

The big point in Grinnells downr

Pioneer offensive passes frequently.

by many as the crack quarterback of
the Bulldog gridders, was their lead-

George and Martha are not consis-

pearance is limited to one night each
year. somewhere around the time of
George’s birthday, when, at the ine

their colonial friends invade the
men’s gymnasium and sweep across
the floor to the strains of the vir-
ginia Reel, the Rye Waltz, audiol—
