Polish Pianist
Highly Praised

By Bill Wilson

Maryla Jonas, me magnificent
Polish pianist, startled her Grin—I
nell audience with an enchanting|
interpretation of the classics. Herl
deep feeling for the classics and1
perfect technique places Miss
Jonas among the leading pianists;
of today. ‘

Miss Jonas displayed dynamic
power, which is uncommon among
women pianists. The many mel-
odic motifs were well pronounced,
and the difficult runs were tonal—.
ly clear and true.

The following were chosen by
Miss Jonas as encores: “MuSic
Box" by Lobaz, “Song of Love”
by Rachmaninoff: Casella Suite——
“Soldiers Dance”, “Dance Lesson”,
“Bolero", and “Gallop."

There we were—at the game
of the century, the Honor G in-
itiates versus the‘ faculty. Every
one of them mounting,
mounted on, or in the vicinity of
a jackass.

Dr. Neil Klausner put his phil-
osophy to work, but burrows
seem to have about as much logi-
cal reasoning as a beginning
class. Stubhee raised his fist, but

the results were in the bucking _

negative.

Mr. Herbert Reichert and Mel
White promoted student—instruc-
to‘r relationships over a basket-
ball and a freshly swept floor.
After a fast and fuming game,
the faculty was defeated 10 to 8.
The Honor 0 initiates won the
pleasure of tying the girl's Can-
ter club team ball in the follow»
ing game.

Nobody asked the donkeys how
they felt about the situation, but
one of the larger and more in-
dependent of them raised a big,
stink over the whole affair.
