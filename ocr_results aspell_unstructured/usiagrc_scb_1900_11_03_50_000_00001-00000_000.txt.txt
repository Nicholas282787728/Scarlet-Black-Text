‘ The Y. M. CA. Lecture Course
comrrrittee are desirous that the
students should secure their
course tickets at once, so that
those selling tickets can give
their time to the citizen’s sale.
It has been customary before for
the lecture course committee to
raise the price of tickets after a
certain date, but it has not been
thought necessary this year.

Reception to President Gates.

Thursday evening the senior
class assembled at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Beyer where they
gave an intormal tnrervell receps
to President Gates. The
ﬁrst part of the evening was spent
in social chatting. During the
latter part the gathering was {as
vored with music by the Misses
Bosquet, Cadwell and Wilson, and
Mr. Macartney. Miss Henderson,
also, in her pleasing way gave a
recitation. Refreshments of ice
cream, cake and coffee were
served during this informal pro
gram. The time slipped by so
rapidly that it was nearly eleven
o’clock before refreshments were
over. As a ﬁtting close to the
evening President Gates,
rather ex-l’resident Gates. spoke
at few words to thé cla. The
words were serious rather than
otherwise, hut, nevertlrclc , they"
Ilt-i
said in part, “Lift: is, :riiut- all, ;:

or

tlrtl not seem inappropiratc.

Wc-know not
how long “C may stay here on

earth, We may be calletl any

time. What does it matter wheth-
er we accept this position or that,
Ol‘live in this house or that. so
long as we make our lives worth
something? The talk contained
several solid thoughts as do all of
his talks whether they are in the
main, light or not.

The seniors probably will miss
President Gates more than any
other class in school. They have
become better acquainted with
him and have commenced to feel
more and more his strength and
inﬂuence. All wish him success
in whatever he may undertake,

The Minnesota Greek Play.

The many friends of Miss Mabel
Hay Barrows in Grinnell will be
glad to learn that she has for the
last six weeks been preparing for
the presentation of ,tlle Greek
play, “The Return of Odysseus.”
at the University of Minnesota.
The play was given on the 30th
and 3lst of October at the Lyce-
um Theater by the members in
the Greek classes of the Universi-
ty. Miss Barrows has presented
the play a number of times and
always with marked success, and
this production of the play at the
Minnesota University was no ex-
ception to the rule. Two years
ago the Junior class ot Iowa Col-
lege, trained and instructed by
Miss Barrows, very successtully
presented the play in place of the
customary Junior Annual.

The play aroused much enthu»
siasm at the university and was
spoken oi as ”one of the biggest
University affairs or the year.“
The Minnesota Daily in speaking
of the difﬁculties which the Greek
Faculty had heretotore experi-
enced in being able to dramatize
some of the familiar Greek clas-
sics says, “At last, in the person
of Miss Mabel Hay Barrows has
appeared the magi 'an who has
made the dream a reality." Tire
week before the play was given
there was a reception given to
Miss Barrows which was a very
enjoyable aifarr, and among those
who were on the reception toms
mittce u'cl'e President and Mrs.
Cyrus Northrop and other nlcnls
bets ol the laculiy. As part oi
the entertainment Miss Barton-s
gave her Japanesc, Swedish and
Greek ditllccs.
