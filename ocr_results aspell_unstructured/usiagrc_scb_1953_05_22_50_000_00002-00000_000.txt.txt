A Thought

What about easing the strain on seniors’ pocket books
this time of year by including diploma fees and rental furl
zaps and gowns in their sem fee?

This could be done by having students pay a higher sem
fee their senior year so each graduate would automatically
receive these essential items.

To the editor:

The attached letter is selfrex-
planatory. it was returned to
the student Council with the
following note:

Dr. Samuel N. Stevens
Grinnell College

President Stevens:

The Grinnell college Stu-
dent Council ofii ally and un-
animously protests your seem-
ing lack of good faith as re-
gards your promise to make
available to the council a
specified ‘breakdown‘ of the
college's budget.

Here is a brief summary of
the events that prompt us to
lodge this protest.

Many weeks ago you told
Gordon Mulder, our official
repr’esentaiive. that you would
ask Controller Norris Neveln
to draw up the budget state-
ment, listing cost per student
in the several expenditure
areas.

After a period of time, when
no action was forthcoming.
Mulder again called on you, at
which time you told him—
using strong language—that it
was neither ready nor avail-
able.

Neither Treasurer R. eA.
Hawk nor Controller Neveln
seem to have received any di-
rections from you as of this
time.

if such a budget statement
is, or Could be made available.
the council is at a loss to un-
derstand why you have not
fulfilled your promise. Will
you please explain the Situa»
tion to us?

Respectfully,
The student Council”

Concerning:

When the attached letter is

good taste, Dr. Stevens will
answer it.

AP.”

However we are told that Dr.
Stevens, in reality, has read the
letter.

It seems to us that the writer
has refrained from unpleasant
detail and unhappy choice of
words, and has been frank but

fair.

We are reluctant to conclude

that the note is merely another

delaying tactic to fill the one-
week gap until everyone has
left the campus and all of yes

terday's promises and protests

are but this morning’s scratch

Dear Everybody,

It's been quite a while since
l've written one of these, but
even as 1 type the knack is re-
turning. And, like the rest of

.ll’lg letters I've written, this con-

cerns recordings of the recent

Imusical‘R/OQM FOR RHYTHTM,

which was, for those of you who

,didn’t attend. the most magnifi-

cent. superb, wonderful musical
presented at Grinnell—much bet<
her even than Up a Tree!!!

Well, the crux of the matter is
that i took a recording of the
show during the performance ,
and, after a bit of editing, 1 feel

that they are good enough to be
put on records. The question is,

'do you want it done againl As

long as I know the ropes, rrh
willing to handle it again or I'll
loan the recording to another

,party. How’s about it? if you do
decide to take the big step again,

i think it best that the records
be done over the summer and
distributed next fall. Same price
too, i might add, l think it
might be worth it as the SING
MAN, SlNG records proved their
worth. Well. what/do you say?
interested parties please let me
know within two weeks and
talk it up a little, ehi some peo-
ple don’t read thls'part of the
Essenhy (Shame, shame).

I also want to take this time
to congratulate the cast and
crews on a swell performance
making my iourteen hundred
mile 'trip (round trip) well
worth the effort. And, Grama
Trollop, it was my forty cents
that bought the pie you got in
your face in the finale. Good
luck to all of you, especially
you graduating seniors. Until I
see you again which i hope will
be soon, I remain,

Yours truly,

Jim Pluss
