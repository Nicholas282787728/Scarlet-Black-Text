the left-wing press.

Having anomted himself an anti-
racislcrusader, Mr. Bell has attempted to
defeat racism in two of HS enclaves,
Harvard and Stanford. In a new book,
Faces at the Batlam of the Well, he con-

his noble attempt.

Although it has earned Mr. Bell

low political screed crudely disguised as
literature. Mr. Bell in his tirade charges
whites in general with having an evil
dispositionia disposition which
prompted them lo “kidnap" blacks from
Africa over the course of several cenhir
lies. Everyone knows that only a com
paralively small number or Wl’ulcs rc-
moved blacks from Africa, and everyone
with more than a second- grade education
knows that they did so with the ready
assistance of black tyraan.

One wonders how seriously people
would lake Mr. Bell if he were a white
given to racist generalizations about
blacks. He probably would not win the
esteem of Dr Haywood Burns and his
fellow liberals—white raclsLS never do.

for whites is Malcolm X. Mr. X's profes-

drug dealer in Boston, At some point he
adopted antirwhite racism and became
involved with the black radicals of the
Nittion of Islam. After disseminating his
nasty nonsense for some years, he fell out
with the Nation of Islam over a petty
issue. Perhaps because It did liol have the
