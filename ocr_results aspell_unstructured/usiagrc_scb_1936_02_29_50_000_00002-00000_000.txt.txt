WE CAN’T FOLLOW THE LOGIC

Recently the curricululll committee decided to release
through the College News Service the names of all students
who maintained the average of .B plus or better for the
. cfind semester. Along with this decision was lllztdc the
ruling that such material can not be released as a news story
for local consumption.

Naturally enough we can not see the logic in the reason-
ing, although it seems to lie in line with the local policy,
We will grant that the story is probably not: of stupendous
importance, still we believe that the attitude of: the committee
is at fault.

The excuse given for prohibi ing local publication is
that it will stir up competitive jcalou lcs among the student'.
Perhaps it would, although we are inclined to think that th
danger is level-emphasized. But nevertheless, why then
release the material at all?

“To suppose that the action was taken ill order to secure
some pnhlici’ty in the different state papers and in so doing
to give an indirect form of recognition to those who have
achieved Sullolas a honors—a sort of publicized Phi Betti
Kappa. lf‘this is so, then we r not release, the ill‘
term] on the campus where real recognition t'ot‘lid lic given.
and where it would be appreciated more than it would as a
five line item ill some daily pallt‘l', if run lit all?

We feel tllat this action on the pilrt of the curriculum
committee is illogical to say the least, and that it is indicative
of the general tendency to look down upon the Scarlet and
Bloch as “just the college newspaper”. and is n paltinl
explanation of. the reluctance with which certain members
of the administration will release information to the paper.

if the problem oi, grildc jealousics, which is so insisted
upon, is to he adequately lnot. then we llelieva thut the
action of the committee was wrong. and thllt much more
might have llCCll accomplished if something was done in the
way 01" a new pi'ogl'nmipm‘ililps the template alinlitinn of

The energies of our system will decay; the glory of the sun will
be dimmed, and the earth, tidcless and inert. will no longer tolerate
the race which has for a moment disturbed his solitude. Man

will go down into the pit and all his thoughts will perish

If the United states and its colleges send into thc population

crucial hour. iDr. ‘G. Bromley Oxham.

Peg Henry '39, would like a man
her own age, interesting to talk
to, and one she could be proud of.
He has to be a good dancer and
make enough money to keep her in
comfort. Peg's husband must be
liked by both men and women, but
he mustn’t be a sissy, And he
mustn’t complain about her cook-
ing!

A man among men, big and
masculine, is the kind Betty Ann
Waller '37, wants. He must also
be kind and considerate, intelli»

success. A profession would be
nice, but isn't necessary She also

‘Beauty Civilized
Mankind ’A sserts
Art Lecturer

“Beauty has eiVi izcd mankind,”
declared Mn Oscar B. Jacobson,
director of art at the University of
Oklahoma, in his lecture, “New
Worlds to Conquer" at Herrick
chapel last Wednesday night,

He compared the past and the
future and said that our world is
entirely different from any pres
ceding generation. The three ma-
jor industries are the automobile.
the movie and the radio; but in
spite of the presence of chaos,
confusion and crime, disregard for
life and political foolishness, our
world is still a world of beauty and
charm.

The big difference of the future
generation will be the increased
leisure, according to Mr Jacobson.
“The disintegration of industry
may ineah another Medieval age."
he said,

He further stated that the pres
ent world is scientifically minded,
but that it: avails nothing to prog—
ress in science if not together with
spiritual progression, Education
should emphasize common interr
csts of mankindithc history of
constructive effort and creative
expression, which are man's Soar-
ing into the highest spiritual
heights, should he taught, lie be-
lieves.

In answering the question,
“What is art?", Mr. Jacobson de-
fined it. as “the record of aesthetic
emotion governed by intellect," It
is an escape from reality and
should enoble and elevate human
nature, he said.

The University of Alaska has,
