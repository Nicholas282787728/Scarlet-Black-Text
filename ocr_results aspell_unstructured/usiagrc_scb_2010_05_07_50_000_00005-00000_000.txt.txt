Chalk artists
inspire on
Mount Vernon

Professional artists and townsfolk alike came together this
weekend to share in the wonder known as Chalk the Walk—an
annual celebration in which a street in Mount Vernon, IA is par-
titioned ott'tor people to chalk images of their choosing.

According to Mount Vernon's website, the festival has its
origins in a 16th Century Italian art form, Madonnari, in which
street artists depicted religious subjects on the streets in order to
earn money There, the Madonnari was coined from the Madons
na herself—the Virgin Mary in Christian art——as itwas a subject
so frequently drawn by the street artists that people saw it fit to
name the art form after the religious figure. Although it's been
a long time since its humble beginnings, Madonnari has spread
throughout the world, and managed to create a new tradition in
a little Iowa town.

When 1 went to Mount Vernon last Saturday to view this

speeraele, I was amazed. I
don't know how Iowa’s VCIT
sion of the Madonnari
compares to the real thing.
Either way, I felt that this
carefree, fun festiwrl was
the perfect my to herald
the warmth and sun of an
Iowa summer and deﬁs
uitely held its own.
Mount Vernon sucs
cessﬁllly translated the
original majesty of this
art form, making it work
in the town’s small set-
tings. All along the street,
chalk squares orahout 10 feet by 12 feet adorned the ground,
created by people with ranging artistic abilities. Although one
professional Madonnari artist ms called in to create a 12 feet by
12 reer recreation of an Italian Renaissance painting, everything
else was left to the public's domain, including one 3,000 square
foot mural depicting a scene from the Wizard of Oz. For 310,
anyone could buy a 2 feet by 2 feet square of the canvas and
contribute to the artwork.

Mural to unify

Bv DEVlN Ross

For the past couple of weeks, members from the Student
Organization of Latinas/Latinos (SOL) could be spotted
painting a large mural on a wall downtown.

Leader of the mural project, Lizeth Gutierrez ’12, got the
idea for the project approximately a year ago.

“We wanted to express a sense of diversity—not just within
the college, but also in the community," said Gutierrez. “We
figured this would be a great way to enhance that,"

Another individual heavily involved in the mural project,
Anastasia Sample ’10 also believes that the mural is an imporr
rant step in building a better relationship between the college
and the Grinncll community.

“This idea basically stems from working with the larger
Grinnell community, since generally we feel as though there is
some tension between the college and the town." Sample said.
“I feel that this is where the idea came from for us to do a mllral
project"

SOL collaborated on the project with the Galaxy Youth
League in an effort to improve relations with the community.
Gutierrez believes that a mural, more so than any other form of
art, will convey this message ofunity,

“By having kids participare, it's a great way to get the col-
lege students to interact Wirh them and also with the commu-
nity," Gutierrez said.

In addition to encouraging unity, a mural also serves as a re
larahle art form for viewers hem a multiplicity othackgrouuds,
according to Gutierrez.

“A mural can make someone from LA. feel at home, it’s a

Nonsprofessional artists made their views known as well,
through various simple drawings depicting bedazzled rainbows,
environmentalist slogans and even a picture of the Iowa country
side. Children who didn't have a mural of their own to decorate

brought their own chalk to the party and decorated the sidewalks
as well as whatever other space was available, adding to the pier
turesque scene.

To accompany the stunning imagery created by the chalk
artists, food vendors adorned the
sidewalks, peddling food of the
10ml variety, usually consisting of
BBqulled pork, pickles, and hots
dogs. Besides the wholesome food,
cute shops such as the Silver Spider
added another element to the rich festival, making it a pleasur-
able occasion overall.

This festiwl is deﬁnitely not something to miss, whether
you're ogling the drawings like me, or adding contributions to
the pavement itself.

College and town of Grinnell

part of our culture,” Gutierrez said. “A mural can be a great way
for people who come from all over the world—it's something
they can identify With in some way. It’s a great spark."

A Grinnell alumna, Director of Conference Operations Ra-
chel Bly'93, donated the wall for the mural, located on the brick
wall at 818 4th Ave, behind the Danish Maid Bakery in town.

Though this is the first time that the College has funded a
mural for the city of Grinnell, it is not the ﬁrst time that SOL
has presented a mural to the community. Paula Matallana '10
described a previous SOL project that incorporated the concepr
ofPalntsbysNumbersﬂ style of art performed by filling num-
bered areas with speciﬁc eolors.

“We got ideas and symbols from SOL members of what,
to them represeared Latino identity," Matallana said. “College
students were then invired ro paint [the mural]. It wasjust ans
other opportunity for community members to come together.
Instead ofjust having one or two arrists paiur, rhis way it was
supposed to represent everyone."

Gutierrez noted that there was an immense amount otsup—
port from members ofthe college community.

“There were a lor of people interested, and one way they
did that was through funding," cunerrez said, “Rachel [Bly],
Dottie [Slick] and Deanna Shorb have all been great support
for us."

Support came pouring in, not only from the college itself,
hut also from those living in Grinnell, according to sample.

“it's such a great recling when we are in town working on it
[and] so many community membcrs stop by and say ‘thank you
for beatltlfying our community,” sample said, “It's nice to talk

to community members and see that they are so appreciative,
and to know that there’s that much kindness."

The mural. designed primarily by sample, reﬂects the val-
ues of the community and the college. For example, the design
includes a book—symbolizing educationﬁlong with others.

“Of course, education is important because of Grinnell’s
support for academia, but also I’m sure within the community,
with people sending their kids to school, etcetera," Sample said.

A tree, Sample’s favorite part, is another constituent of the
mural, and stands for growth

“There are roots in the tree, which symbolizes roots in the
community, and that's something rhar I really like about the
mural," Sample said.

The mural also boasts circles, representing unity.

“We wanted to represent the unity of the community, but
also diversity within thatiwhether it be on a global level or
whatever," sample said, “But there’s also a lot of other symbol-
ism wirhin [the desigal."

Gutierrez feels as though the mural will foster a feeling of
unity for as long .is it is present in town. She hopes that there
will be similar mural projects in the future and tliar other stu-
dent organizations at the college will be inspired by the mural.

“We are working with the kids and a lot of the interactions
we have while is working is Connecting with the townspeople,"
Gutierrcz said, “A mural bllilds this sense of relationshipilt's
like a starting point. "

The official viewing ofthe mural ivill rake place on May
15 at 2 pm.
