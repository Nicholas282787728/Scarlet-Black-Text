The college family is a far reach—
ing and inclusivcterm as a Faculty
Alumnus so aptly points out in an
article appearing in the What Do You
Think column at this issue. There is
the head or the family, who is thc
trustees, the good housewife who is,

if you please, the Iaculty, then there -

is the grown brother, the alumni and
last but not least there is the baby
of the family, the student body. Bo-
side there are the many friends of the
lamily which grow into a list 0! large
proportions.

But the most important member of
the family as a Faculty Alumnus
points out is baby "Student\ Body."
The ﬁgure of the family is not pre-
cisely analagous_tor the students are
more essential than the youngest mem—
her of any family circle. It is for
them that the other college groups
‘i‘unction or maintain their interest
True the student body away and

. the college would have no excuse ior
existence.

All the members of the college {8.11:4
ily are guided in their actions by what
they considerto be for the best in-
terests of the students. Thisdoes not
mean that they are :ollowing the judg-
ment of the student body. Every
group diliers to some extent as to
just What does constitute the best in»
terest of the students. As the young-
est memher of the family the student
budy naturally lacks perspective in
certain college issues:

There will always be this disagree
ment as to What makes 20! the ulti-
mate good of the students. Repeat
ing What We have already said in a
former editorial We will have certain
ideas on this subject. Many will not
agree with us. No one Will deny that
a better understanding between all.
parties concerned on the various ques-
tions of student lile is necessary to
wise progress. The Scarlet and
Black presents the logical medium.
our ideas Will be expressed through
the editorial columns. The “What Do
You Think” column invites all who
are enough interested in the college
welfare to make their opinions public
for the common weal. The import—
:mce 01' the column depends entirely
on the irlends oi the college.

We are convinced that the pest of
nests is the man who snore: so loud
in his two-ﬁfteen class that his 2e1<
low students can’t sleep. ' Might we
suggest the use of clothes pins.

An instance of mob rule occurrcd in
Grinnell last night in the action of
two underclasses in working their
unauthorized will against individual
upper classmen. In principle it was
identical With the mob which lynches
a southern negro. The action should
he considered as such.

It was a breach of general tradi—
tional college discipline. By virtue cl
an added two years of college experi—
ence upperclassmen have inherited a
legacy of audios-its over their younger
college brothers It is a tradition
which has not weakened, Unbcrclass—
men of Grinncll should remember the
affair of last night as an open rebel—
lion of underclassmcn. They should
take pains to see that a similar occur»
rence is made impossible in the fu—
tnre.

In this instance the underclassmcn
as a body can not be held entirely at
fault. A combinatoin or misleading
circumstances and a few thoughtless
leaders servcd to temporarily carry
them off their feet

_._4;_

’l'he tribe of matters seems to be

tairly well scattered thru all classes

of humanity. There is the pollucal
grafter and the big business gralter,
there is the crooked clergyman and
the shell game man at the county
lair. The college also plesents a
band of gralter apart and distinct
irom ltll other varieties of th species.
We do not have in mind the college
student who cheats in on examina-
tion. Wc would class him not as a
gi-after but as a tool (or he is cheat-
ing himselt

We are thinking of the college man
or woman who for so much money will
do a certain piece or scholastic work,
write a theme or a report or any other
of the many things which do not re-
quire the student’s individual atten—
tion to put across.
Here is a gutter who plies a most
prolitablc game. First he gets the
money, second and most important
he takes from his dmpluyer the knowr
ledge and mental training which
should have been his.
We do not blame the grafters. As
long as there is a demand for this
sort or thing there will be plenty of
agents to take advantage ol' the upper
tnhity.

After every student agitation over
Sunday dates, dancing, dormitory gov-
ernment, dining room management, or
any of the many matters that are cl
moment in our campus cosmos, there
is always a period during Which many
students make inquiry, somewhat be.
tweennndignatlon and bewilderment
with the general ,hurden: “Well, it's
over now; what will come of it? What
are We going to get out of it? Why
doesn’t somebody do something! 1 ‘1
Well, we're stung againhthat’s all. And
they talk about Grinnell democracy
and student government!"
The dissatistaction among students
ta get immediately and completely
what they demand is natural enmlgh,
csnecailly When we consider the im—
perfect concept“ that most of us have
of the makeup and nature at the col—
lege.

lt‘ would, I think, aid immensely inl
clearing the murky air of our theories ,
of college polity if we would simply
list the various categories ct persons
will) are connected with a college. It
would help us to realize that the col—
lege community is a much more com
plex thing than We usually think

Let us try to make such a list of
the elements that go to make 111) a
complete college group. olrhand,
these occur: the student body, the
faculty, the administrative officers.
the trustees, the alumni and existum
dents, the patients of students, pros-

the student body.

two students, ﬁnancial benelactors
both past and prospective, investors
in the bonds or the college foundation,
ministers of the denomination most
prominent in the college, the town
people, and friends oi the college in
general. This is not at all a complete
list, but it will serve the present pur-
stc. Everything mat is done by the
students or tho taculty or any other or
these groups has its effect on all the
other groups. Everything that is
proposed by the studenm or the laculty
will be approved or opposed by every
other group, according to the point of
view, the interests, and tho prejudices
or the latter. Interests and preju-
dices sometimes clash beyond any
chance of reconciliatio 1 an excellent
example in the nutside world is, the
pr‘cscnt conﬂict between the ladders
over the daylight saving law. When
such a clash occurs in regard to any
proposed line of action, the actual
carrying out of the project must gen-
erally be deterred until one side or
tnc other has been overcome or out-

Dersua/ded.

Unquestinnably the most important
single element of all these groups is
It is for the stu-
dents actually in the college at any

given time that all the other groups

that the teachers teach, that
the president and trustees seek endow-
ment, that the yarents labor, that
prospective students are solicited to
interest themselves in the college. The
college exists for the student, and all
the other groups are either auxiliaries
or by-products. But that is not say-
ing that the student will get immedi-
ately and completely everything that
he asks for. The other groups that
minister to the students are instrur
ments to be sure, but they are human
instruments, and being human they
demand at least some consideration
for their Views and whims.

Let us, then, always remember that
We are not alone in the World, that
our problems are not our problems
solely, that the fulﬁlment of our de-
sires may work someone else a mis
chief greater than the good we stand
to gain. Above 2.11, let us remulnhcr
that where we are right it will talrc
time to Win all these other elements
in our small World over to our Way of
thinking. The chlcl fault of the
theories as in their Childish impatience
Bolshevlki lies not so much in their
and intolerance of those who do not
accept their doctrines. Let us not be
college Bolsheviki.
