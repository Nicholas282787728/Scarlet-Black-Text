EXCELLENT WORK

The performance of the Don Cossack Male
chorus last Wednesday was one of the finest
of its kind that has ever been given on the
Grinnell campus. To those who arranged for
this program, we wish to extend the heurtiest
of congratulations, for they indeed achieved It
worthwhile thing.

Grinnell always has been known as a cul-
tural school, as the large crowds which i
nessed the dramatic performance of Cornelia
Otis Skinner at Homecoming and then heard
singing of the Russians, shows, The cultural
spirit has not been dead at Grillnell, but instead
has been dormant. Whenever something
really worthwhile is presented on the campus,
the student body appreciates the foot and turns
out in large numbers. However, Whenever
mediocre performers are imported, the students
naturally do not respond.

The recital course, like the lecture, has _

got off to fl flying start and the members of the
department of music, who arranged for the up-
peal'ullcc of the Don Cossacks, are to be most
heartily congratulated.

’l‘hc continuance of such outstanding events
isto he hoped for, and as long as such worth
while lltll'fLCtiOnS as have appeared during the
past week continue to be brought to the Grillllell
campus, there seems to be little need for wor
iug about the cultural development of the Gulls
llcllizlns.

CAN THIS BE PATEIOTISMI _
(Daily nojan)

Thousands of miles from their homeland a-

qusrter of o million Italians are fighting their way
across rugged deserts, relentlessly slaying ill-equip-
,ped Ethiopian warriors and dropping bombs upon
defenseless women and children. Gladly these 5017
rliers face sudden death, hardship, and disease in
order to be heroes in the eyes of their countrymen.

Is this patriotism?

In the commonwealth of Massachusetts a cow
clove of solemncfaced officials reach o momentous
decision. An 8-year-old child is too dangerous o
radical to remain in school because, through relig-
ious conviction, he refuses to salute the American
flag.

is this patriotism?

A powerful publisher, whose fortune is counted
in hundreds of millions of dollars, for years exhorts
the American public through his mighty chain of
newspapers to "Buy American!” The newsprint
which clay after day carries his impassioned plea,
is purchased in Scandinavia, 4

If the thinking citizens refuse to accept as his
ccncepticn’cf patriotism the demagogery of a dim
tator, the punctiliousness of a board of education,
or the chauvinism of a powerful publisher, what is
he to substitute?

Might one look backward to the man who over.
came defect and despair, and despite overwhelming
obstacles with a dwindling army persevered to win
freedom for his native land? One also could con-
sider the lonely figure that was the butt of every
uncouth jester, target of each venomous editor, an
object of scam in his own cabinet who unflinchingly
pursued his course until he had freed an oppressed
people.

To Washington and Lincoln patriotism was not
merely a surface force. To them and to the true
patrl’ot of today. patriotism is the loving of one's
country well enough, devotedly enough, loyally
enough, to put forth a certain amount of courage,
not for the sake of personal gain or glory, but to
attain a higher state of civilization.

This is patriotism.

Colgate President Says

kind is marching the road to desv
tructian," said Dr, George Barton
Cuttcn, president of Colgate Uni.
versity, in a recent speech.

"A civilization which removes
natural checks more rapidly than
it fosters high controls commits
suicide," Dr. Cuttcn declared.

“The greatest sinners are prob-
ably the philanthropists and the
doctors. They have done every»
thing they could to preserve the
unfit, If anything happens to pro-
tection the race is doomed.”

“Man has always had to be kick.

JSPOR TS.

By Henry Hirsch

This scribe hos heard several
people soy that they thought the
Creighton teem had been greatly
over-rated prior to the "game here
Saturday. However, we feel that
it was not that the Bluejays were
weaker. but that the Pioneers were
stronger than the fans had’
thought.
a s ..
not old paradox of compare
five scores was shown nguin
shtui-doy when Coe whipped the
State TcMhers.18-0. Cue hﬂll
previously fought a 0,.) tie with
Cornell, while Cornell had also
ploycd u scoreless tie with the
Tutors.
e . o
Dibble and Langan just Can't
seem to show-any decided results
in their specdball games. These
teams tied 5-5 in their first meet— .
ing, while neither team was able to
score in the playoff game. Two 'ex-
trc periods were played in both
games, so that, all in all, the two
teams have played the equivalent
of three contests.
e s e
Riley of Rawsou and Cutfonh
of Limg‘an are tied for the speed-
hall scoring leadership in games
played up to last night. Both
men have scored 12 points, Riley
hos scored four goals, whlle out-
forth hos mlunlﬂated his points
with two goals, two free kicks
nod two passes. McMurray,
Itewson captain, is in third place
.with 11 (allies to his credit.
