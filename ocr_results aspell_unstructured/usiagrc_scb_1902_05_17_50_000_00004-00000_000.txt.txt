GRINNELL THE VICTOR.

Drake and Griitnell met in it
game or ball at Ward Field on
Wednesday afternoon and Grin.
nell added another game to her
string at victories, winning by a
score of9t04. A inirsized crowd
witnessed the game, Previous to
the game the outlook for Grinnoll
was gloomy. Fisk, sverreliahls
in [he ﬁeld and at bar, was called
home by the death of his grand-
father, and it was feared his loss
would seriously handicap the
team. The men, however, rallied
to the emergency, and the only
damage resulting consisted in the
errors nindc owing to the shifting
about of the players. In the 7th
inning Kinney oi Drake was out
for batting in Owsley's place.
