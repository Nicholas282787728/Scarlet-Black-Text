ALUMNAE GREETINGS,

Messages to Iowa College.

Dear Y. W. C. A, Girls:7

In spite of the fact that I live
only sewenteeu miles from Grinnell
and manage on go up occasionlly ior a
day and also that I read every item of
news that comes to meconcerning the
Y. W. C. A. still I confess that I feel
considerably out of touch with the
actual work which the Association is
doing, because I have not been able to
attend asingle Y. W. C. A, gathering
since our farewell meeting in the
spring or 15105

I have seen your raw building how-
erer, and I am sure with such sur-
roundings you must be doing more
effective work than has ever been
done by the Christian Association in
Iowa College before. The building is
beautiful and 1 was amazed WhenI
saw the artistic and appropriate
Iurnishings and learned that they
were all paid for. The present
cabinet must be composed oi excellent
ﬁnanciers.

One lusury always calls ior- another,
and I hope your next step may be to
employ aGeneral Secretary, for San'
ly the work of the president with the
additional responsibility of an A5507
ciation building, is more than a col-
lege student can do justice to. We
felt the need of a Secretary when the
Association building was nothing
more than an air castlegand I, for one,
and I am sure a good many former Y.
‘V. C. A. girls would be glad to help
toward raising a fund for such a
purpose.

Wishing you continued success in
your Christian work.

Sinner-1y your friend,
Mr .\' M. RAYMOND, ’05.

Dear Iowa College Girls:-

It is with mingled ieelings alloy
and sadness tiiatl write a mrssdge to
you through the women's edition of
the SCARLET AND BLACK. Joy,be~
cause of the sacred remembrances
which cluster around the class-room,
instructors, Y. W. (1A. with its mid-
week prayer meeting and various
committee meetings. the society halls
and the friendships (armed during
ﬁre years DI college life. Sadness,
because those years, which then
seemed long, hare down, friends have
been separated and only the memory
of them remains, But then it is
better. as some one has Said, to be a
“has been" than to be a "never Was."

My message to you is this: do not
be in a hurry to complete your college
course. Iryour work seems lledvyi
too heavy to allow you to join the
Young Woman’s Christian Associdr
tion or a Literary Society, by all
means take lire years to Complete it
instead oi Ioul'. It is the inﬂuence of
the Y. w. C. A. and class prayer
meetings, the Bible and Mission
Study classes and the Literary Socie-
ties that will prepare you to lill the
place the world has ior you. True,
your studies must not be neglected,
but take time iDr both. I dare say
that within two, live or ten years you
will have iorgotteu much that is con-
tained within the covers or your text,
books, but the inlluence oi your in-

structors, the iniluence oi the social
and religious life cl Iowa College upon
your lives and characters will never

be eﬂaced.
The world needs busy women: it.

needs women who have been trained
to rill places or responsibility, honor
and trust in the home, society and
the church. Take time. girls, to pre-
pare yourselves to ﬁll those places
when they shall be given to you, in
such a mum that you may serve
your College and your God.

Very sincerly.
BER’YHA M, \VisE, ’05.

In sending a greeting to those or
you who are lortunate enough to
be at Gilnnell there is always a
chance 1.0 oiler high-sounding and
timerilonored advice—that's where
the alumni have the upper hand. But
I shall let the golden opportunity pass
and simply tell you how happy it
makes me to be brought into sudden
and iutimale touch wirh you in this
way

It is douhcless acase in which “it is
more blessed to give than to receive,”
and the thrills or pleasure coming
Irom this moment or communication
are all my own. For college days and
college irrends I cannot be too thunk-
iul, and Flu glad icr all or you that
you will be able to say the same
thing.

Arum IIcvurss, oi.

To Those Who ArerGreetingsi

It is strange how much we 'whb
have graduated tool as ii we
were yethllege students and society
workers: So real is the reeling and so
deeply do We feel interested in the
uuestions presenting themselves to
you, that without knowing it, you
have the sympathy or a huge number
oi those who lull-c been!

Ourinterest in these duestlons is
due in part to pure altruism and in
part to theiactthat these very pro-
blems have proved valuable to us in
our work as we have met various types
of people. Ourcollcgc ideals, so vital
a part or our college daysarestill vital
in our own lives. To gire them to
others audio be able to cope wiih
practical questions such as you are
meetingiu organized work, are very
prosaic necessities iound in what we
sometimes call “real life.”—But with-
out that ability, ideals count rcr rar
less than their intrinsic worth.

Society Training—not only the
training ui appearing in pubhc, but
also the traluing or working with
otherseccmes to mean much to one
mingling ior the lirsttlme \vullorhers
who are busy in the work oi hie

Wishing ior you now and in tile
rulurc the best things in your fellow-
ship wirh each other.

Sincerely yours

You may be sure that. the women’s
number is always a most welcome (18‘

perhaps to the men. alrllongll they
may not be so frank in admitting it,
All the hard labor and Worry are not
in vain, as each year's edition adds to
the listoi the glorious achievements
of the Women of Iowa College, than
Whom there are none better in the
land. It is the ideal part Oi the co-
education at Grinnell that the
women can prove to be at least the

It. certainly is a pleasure to send
greetings thru the columns or the
SCARLET AND BLACK to the faculty
and students, butespeoially to the girls
of the college to Whom the Women‘s
Edition is of particular importance.

You all teal you are a vital part of
the college and each one could write
pages on what the college means to
you but it is nor. until you have passed
the line and have become an “old
graduate“ that yuuloegiuto appreciate
Iowa College There may be times ill
college when you wonder if. after all.
it pays, but wait until you are out in
the cold world and the wonder will be
how you Could ever have been happy
without your Alma Mater.

This is merely another oration
added to the many for Iowa College
but when time and space are precious
that is the only thought worth Vvhile.

Very Sincerely,
