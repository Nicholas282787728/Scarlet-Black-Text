Living the dream on the juiced up shores of Jersey

Here’s the skinnyml thinkl speak for the
majority of twentyrsomethings with a taste for
the pastiche when 1 say that MTV's rnonur
mental series, “Jersey Shore," is the most adr
dictive program to hit basic cable since the ad
vent of Bravo's realo-fashion. monopoly (think
“Top Chef" and “Project Runway") so i like
many of you irony-clad Dream Livers out
there, was glued to the Tv for each episode
of this paradoxical program, even on a second
or third go around. Bur as an aspiring critic of
the mass media which I consume, I’m finding
it difﬁcult to make sense out of this television
experience.

Was it ok for me to watch Ronnie un»
abashedly engender stereotypes of the violent

Italian meatrhead again and again, or should

1 have boycotted such unconr
scionable performances from
the start? Or on the flip side,
am I the one to blame for ironic
cally taking sadistic and classist
pleasure in Snookie's charming .
witticisms like her preference
for “gorilla juicehend" men?

my socialrlife hours dedicated
to etymological discussions of

TO THE EDITOR

Students should serve on CAS ’

The Committee on Academic Standing
(CAS) governs calendar revisions, classroom
and academic misconduct, graduation require?
ments and many other academic policies. It is
also the only committee that directly impacts
individual students'lives that still lacks student
representation.

' After last year’s discussions about increas»
ing student stakeholdership, the previous SGA
Vice President for Academic Affairs Julie
Hoye ’09 worked with Associate Dean Kath—
leen Skerrett to add Uial memberships for
students to CAS. Applicants were thoroughly
vetted for the professionalism and conﬁdence
that such service would require The SGA
V'PAA selected two student applicants to be
interviewed by two members of CAS and ulti-
mately appointed by the Dean ofthe college.

One year and four student representatives
later, CAS members, faculty, staff and students
alike, unanimously hailed the trial as a success.
Committee members reported that student
input in forming their policies not only made
the process morejust, but also provided unique
insights abour the pmcncil effects ofsaid poll»
cics. The Dean oftlie College, the Chair of the
Faculty, Joint Board as a whole and a student
initianve that passed overwhelmingly by popr
ular referendum all joined CAS in formally
recommending that student membership be
made a permanent part ofthe Committee.

Sadly, on Monday, Feb. 1, the faculty vore

also ro immediately end the trial period and

and the appropriateness ofsmdents’ proximity
to sensitive personal information about their
peers.

simply no place for living the dream?

First, I will take as a given that most of us
already enjoy watching different sorts of reality
Tv, whether or not we know how to explain
it. But to give you a more direcr sense of the
shows commercial success, “Jersey Shore" has
still done all right by MTV, even with under—
standable boycotts from major Italian Ameri~
can organizations like UNiCO. According to
the LA Times, the season finale had some 4.8
million viewers, which was almost triple the
numbers from its premier. With such a re-
markable surge in viewer turn over the span of
only two months, it’s no wonder that I found
myself spending more and
more of my time doing amar
teut anthropology. But was the
pleasure I rook in watching
these young men and women
party, bicker, and work on their
tans based solely on a compar»
ative politics to make me feel
better for being so Bourgie?
Or do Mike the Situation’s abs
and Paulie's invincible hair re-
ally do something for us that is
more than just a trip to a virtual human zoo?

While I cannot make any identificatory
remarks on behalf of Italian Americans per se,
I can note thar along with the long-forgotten

significanrly open up students'stakeh’oldership
in their own dis pline and expand the crust
that students place in their peers. The Col-
lege Hearing Board, where (haemost severe
cases concerning suspension and expulsion are
heard, now includes student representation for
the ﬁrst time. Not only have students proven
to be competent and professional, but they
have time and again supported the notion that
judgment by one‘s peers is avital tenet ofself—
governance:

Every disciplinary board reform was debat-

‘ed, amended and passed in open Joint Board

meetings by students' elected representatives
in consultation with the existing members of
those boards. Similarly, the proposed reform to
CAS was supported not only by every member
of the Committee, faculty and staff alike, but
was also voted on twice by students, once by
their elected representatives and a second time
in a campusrvvide referendum.

Grinnell College has for years compli—
mented a liberal arts education with what
has become one ofour commumtys defining
principl - har students are not only capable
of contributing to their own governance, but
also that they are made more responsible and
intelligent citizens of the' world by doing so.
We are saddened that a slim majority of the
faculty still do not believe students understand
the implications ofor professionalism required
for such shared governance.

CAs, unlike the college Hearing Board
unlrkerhe Budget Steering Committee, unlike
the Board of Trustees and unlike the Presi-
dential Search Committee, is now the only
committee directly governing student life that
operates without students, We are grateful to
the faculty that supporred this initiative and
sincerely hope the faculty who opposed it will
reconsider theii position

it really means to do Italian Americanrness.
How could you ever capture the essence ofan
ethnic identity in one historical moment, and
why would you even want to? But with these
preliminary ethnographical limitations being
set, whar then is so especially compelling about
a house full of troglodytic reiﬁcations of ob-
jectionable cultural stereotypes that trumps the
popularity of other demographic day—in—the-
life reality series (who the f‘ck even remembers
that bullsh’t ‘Laguna Beach")?

It‘s their god damn sincerity. Unlike past
television experiences, the “Jersey Shore" cast
doesn’t seem to be faking their commitment to
the dream rhey are living in their summer share
at the shore. One gets the feeling that Snookie

Limited language can limit your life

After a recent e—mailrng of the Russian De
partment newsletter, a response from a student
was delivered en masse to everyone on the lisr.
It read,

"Why would 1 get this? What in the world
made you think that filling up my box with
your crap would be a good thing? Too had we
won world war two and the cold war so Eng-
lish is the dominant language.

There's nowhere you would WANT to go
where anyone you would WANT to talk to
wont speak English to you, you dont NEED
to speak- another language. We're the only peo-
ple with that linguistic privilege and you just
wasrcd it by learning another language anyway
Real bright arent we?"

The e mail sparked several replies in which
people declared that ignorance such as this was
precisely why they study another language
Others were deeply offended by such non-
chalant statements about war. Our wonder-
ful language assistant Anastasia Selemeneva
pointed out that Russia alone lost 27 million
people in World War 11, while others ofus lost
family in concentration camps, erlimc cleansr
ings and battles. And did we really “win” the
war? My own grandfather was only 19 when
he invaded Omaha Beach and spenr a year in

German POW campsihe was haunted by the '

memories for the rest ofhis life. Is this consid~
crcd “winning," rhe destruction of young men
rhe same age as rhc complaining student and

from this e-mail is that this student’s feelings

are hardly unique at Grinnril. Through my
four years here I have met students who re-
fuse to take classes in a foreign language be-
cause they “don’t need it”or "it’s not required."
Others have expressed an interest in going to
Grinnell—in-London so they won't encounter
a language other than English. so many op?
portunities appearwhen you have even the
simplest understanding ofa second language,

. and I‘ve met plenty ofpeople who don’t speak

English with whom I WANTED to spend
time and talk.

If we are to avoid further wars and intoler-
ance, we need to make an effort to be open
to languages and cultures other than our
own The knowledge of only one language
(be it English or otherwise) can only take you
so far. If you don’t want to experience other
lands, cultures or simply our shared humanity,
that’s your choice, but don’t brag about your
supposed intelligence to those of us who have
taken advantage of Grinncll’s inulrirlingual
community and amazing language professors
and assistants—we’ll be out in the world fulr
