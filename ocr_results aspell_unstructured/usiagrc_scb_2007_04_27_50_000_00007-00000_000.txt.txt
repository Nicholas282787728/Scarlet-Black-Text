Colleges across the country are reporting that 2007 is their most competitive year for applicants and Grinnell is no exception.
This year the college has hosted more applicants and visitors than usual, with over 1,500 prospective students and families
setting foot on campus during April. Sixteen tour guides introduce these masses to the college and over 100 current stu-
dents act as hosts. But Grinnell students are curious -- how do these wanna-be Grinnellians perceive our school? Here’s what

one prospie has to say for himself.

Bab}: Bob’s Underground Cafe is.pretiy unique to
GrinneH.The first thing explained to me about this
place was that it never turns a proﬁt, and is heavily
funded by the school. Also, it was named after a cat.
These two things, when combined with the music
mix of someone on LSD, make Bob’s an oddly ens
dearing plate.

JRC: The JRC is obviously Grinnell’s new play
toy, and for good reasons. Every room has a cool and
(to use a Grinnell term) ost-modern feel,with plen-

of open space and light. My personal favorites are

C 101 and the little area above the cafe. Speaking
1

of the cafe, the people were friendly and t e food

was delicious. Good food seems to be a theme at
Grinnell, since the one dining hall had more choices
than most restaurants. I partook of the stirefry, not
realizing that its “spicy sauce" would burn my tongue
off. Even tongueless, though, Grinnell's food is a cut
above the rest. '

Dorms: As far as dorms go, Younkers is just swell
With the exception of light pourin into rooms at
the crack of dawn, it feels comfortab e and just large
enough. The bathrooms were apparently designed
without regard'for actual human size, but the area
was clean and (dare I say it?) nice, which seems to be
against policy at all other schools. I give YOUHkCI‘S an

8 out of 10, 9 ifyou have good blinder shades,

Mac Field: The campus, as a whole, did not get
any breaks the weekend I was here. It seems that the
freak cold front kept everyone indoors, so despite
everyone and their mother telling me that peo le are
out in the grass studying every day, it seeme kind
of dead. The exception to this rule was durin the
Ultimate ractice, when the true athletes brave the
cold for t 1e sake of the greatest sport ever invented.
Midway throu h practice we saw some more people
braving the co d in the truest sense of the word. In
fact, these people were so brave that they said “no"
to clothes, when everyone else was asking that they
say “yes."
