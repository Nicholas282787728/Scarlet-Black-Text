Plans for widening of High-
Way six through Gl‘lnnell were
approved by \meml'bers of the
Grinnell City Counml during the
regularly scheduled meeting of

the highway. An estimated 15
feet will be added to the road

feet will he added on the south
side following the curve.

ject will extend the surface of
the highway to a,total of 48
feet in lludth and will commence
on Reed sreet, where the pre-
sent wide highway now ends
and continue to the east city
limits. Work on the project is
not slated to commence until
next: spring, and when complet-
’ed will have four lanes, each
12 feet wide, extending across
the city. from the east to west
