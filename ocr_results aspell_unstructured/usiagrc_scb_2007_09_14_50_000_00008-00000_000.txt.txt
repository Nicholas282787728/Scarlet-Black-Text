Off-campus style,
living on-campus

BY GAYATRIJAYAL

Many students like living in the dorms to avoid cooking
for themselves or cleaning their own bathroom. But this
fall, a new style ofdorlns opened on campus that encour-
ages these dreaded activities for the students who chose to
live there.

Over the course of last school year, rhc college tenor
vatcd the old Cowles Dining Hall inrn apartments. Most
otthc apartments are nvo ﬂoors,with a living space on the
first ﬂoor and bedrooms on the sccond.They come with a
full kitchen and private bathroom. Some of the other amen
ilities include built-in cabinets and closets, television along
with free cable and a DVD playcr.Two apartments have
handicapsaccessiblc first-floor bedrooms and kitchens.

“They’re great, very luxurious," said Mike Inman ’09.
“We get a lot otspace, especially in the bedrooms,"

Othei students living in the apartments note the ame-
nities that come with living in a new building. “It's really
nice to live here after living on South campus last year,
especially because of tlie air conditioning," said Amanda
Fleck ‘08, one of the two SAs for the apartments.

While thctt: is a lot of praise for the apartments, stu-
dents living there also note a few downsides. “We lnust
clean it ourselves, includinw the bathrooms," said joc Fox
'08. In addition to maintaining the hygienic conditions
without the help of FM. Fox found fulthel problems with
the apnrrmcntrstylc set up ofthe dorm. “You are pretty sc-
cludcd and I like to be pretty social on my ﬂoor,"Fox said.

Inman has found the same problem as Fox, desctlbing
the ﬂoor as "rather insular." He also noted that whilc it is
nice to have a kitchen. living in the apartments is still more
expensive than living ortrctnnpus, heroic students must he
on a meal plan, albeit a more limited ycision.

In spite of these problems, lnman thought that the
apartments are still an appealing housing option tor up-
perclassmen. “I think it will do a good jol) kccping seniors
on campus,“ lninan said.

“The best thing about living in the apartments are the
added spice, and an incienscd reeling of independence,"
said Fox. “It almost feels like 1 am living off-campus, on,
campus.“

Last year, residents of Cowles began their fall semester in
nncxpcctedly horrible conditions.Thc sound ofdrills and jack-
hammers shook the dorm incessantly and students periodically
necdcd to keep their Wlndows and doors closed during episodes
of sandblasting, even during some of rho hottcst days of the
semester, Some students found themselves unable to take naps
and telr forced to study elsewhere while others had allergic re
actions to the dust that permeated the dormitory due to the
sandblasting.

Last year, the Cowles Dining Hall and the rest of the ﬁrst
floor were demolished to make room for more dorms and for
a new set of apartments. While the construction was going on
downstairs, there were still students living on the second and
third ﬂoors dealing with the harsh living conditions.They spent
the year ﬁghting the school to improve the dorm environment
before gaining compensation at the end ofthe year.

Because of the decreased standard of living, Cowles resin
dents frequently complained to college administrators After a
mishap where the heat was turned off near the end of the fall
semestcr, the administration decided to credit each student’s
Pioneer Onchard accounts with $50. »

Secondrﬂoor residents Neo Morakc '09 and Rebecca John—
ston ’10 filed a formal list of grievances. Their twtrpage list
started by discussing the direct adverse citccts of the ongoing
construction of the apartments, describing the “incessant, often
painful noise” experienced by Cowles residents on weekdays
starting at around 8 or 9 am. and ending at 4 or 5 pm.

The list also talked of the hearing, saying that after the
heat was restored, heating was “erratic and unreliable in some
rooms," while all students lost control of their rooms’ speciﬁc
heat levels. Finally, they described two instances where with-
out watning, for an extended period of time, the hot water in
Cowles went out during the winter, forcing residents to either
shower elsewhere or suffer the cold water during some of the
coldest days of winter.

In response to student grievances, members of Residence
Life, Facilities Management and the administration convened a
meeting on Feb. 22 with Cowles residents to discuss the issues,
living conditions and possible compensation.

After the meeting, the administration decided upon a re-
imhurselnent to students of $450 per semester, approximately
equivalent to the cost of staying in the dormitory for a month.

Students such as Benji CantorrStone ’08 found the reim-
butsment a “pleasant surprise." However, even with the reim-
butsment, the construction left a mark on the students who
lived there CantorrStonc also said taking cold showers during
the few days that the hot water was gone “may have been the
most viscerally unpleasant experience of Cowles."
