the appeal in music it inch can one

enlightening explanation to this
dilemma as he explicate: the air

music "In general." he says.
”the Goldberg variation is of one

constancy. Diabelli. on the other
hand, has an unfathomable
aspect. not there in the Goldberg.
There are some battling ins
congruities between mediocrity oi
the waltz and transcendent
greatness oi the variations."

there is also an historical ap-
peal to the Diabelli piece,
Delbaum said. During one oi the
many European wars around the
turn at the iolh century. it
publisher decided to raise money
ior wai- viidoyvs by soliciting pres
minent musicians oi the day to
contribute musical segments
which would additively create a
single work. the resulting pro-
ceeds were then distributed to the
war widows. Over 100 composers
responded. including Schubert
who contributed a "pretty and
Sturdy” piece,

Beethoven's initial redclion to
this publisher's request was to ask
in a leitcr why he 7 the publishe

.7. was wasting his 7 beetho . in s
time. Perhaps Beethoven saw the

opportunity to do something real-
ly- explosive with this lragmented
piece when he iinally did respond
musically ii uas with a "Bang".
Beethoven entII‘Ei) breaks the

0etbaum acknowledges Artur
Snovel and Leonard Shure as
direct influences on his own
creative genius and he also gives

.gratis to Rubenstein and his ad»

mlratlon to Glenn Gould.

Uelbaum spoke also oi the subs
its influence of Nadia Heisenberg.
one of his instructors during his
attendance at the Marines Conser-
vatory oi Music. By the time
(Jelbaum studied at Manlles.
Reisenberg had stopped givmg
solo periormanees tollowing the
death of her husband. instead
iteisenberg pertormed with a
chamber ensemble While he
studied at lilannes, Uelbaum did
not readily learn musical inter-
pretation or tactics from
BelSthel‘g, However. she was a
“fabulous teachei " Oelbaum
Said, and he referred to her as “a
supreme pianist and a person oi
extremely high attainment," As
he matured artistically. much oi
her instru tioii took onprcyionsly
