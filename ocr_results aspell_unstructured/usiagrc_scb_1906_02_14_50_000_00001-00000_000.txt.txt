dresses to the students.

The Day of Praver for Colleges has
come and gone and Grirlnell srndents
have rtcleﬂl’er vision and a. better un-
derstanding of the teachingsnud ideals
of the lowly Nazarene than they hatl
before. The addresses by Rev. Wil»
llam Burt/0n, D. D . pastor of the First
Congregational church, or Oak Park,
Illinois, were ﬁlled with aspirit and Li,
power that cannot. help but have an
iuliuence for good on the students
lives. Dr. Barton was truly 2!. "man
with a message," and his pleasing elo»
quence coupled With his simple man-
ner of presentation, won for him the
hearts of the students. Dr. Barton is
sure of A. Warm welcome at Grinnell
when he comes again.

The ﬁrst serrloe of the day was at 10
o'clock, when Dr. Baiton gave his
opening address, His text was taken
from the tenth chapter of First Sam-
uel, the sixth and seventh verses:
”And the Spirltof the Lord will Come
upon thee, and tlicti shalt prophesy
with them, and shalt be turned into
another man. And let it be, when
these signs are come unto thee, that.
thou do as occasion serve thee; lor God
is With thee.”

is appalling,

"Too many people are content with
average respectability and satistied
with moderate success Do not be
content to have college with mediocre
ideas to live like other people, God
wants you tore nobler purpose, higher
than other people.“ Dr. Barton drew
a comparison from “the modern para-
ble of Casey at the Bat” and said, “If
college men let Lhe ball of opportunity

some people doubt what the score is
