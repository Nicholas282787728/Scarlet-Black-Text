Pioneers start to hit,
but come up short again

By Alex Severens

The Search for the year’s first vic-
tory continues for the Grinnell soft-
ball team, as their most recent four
games extended the losing streak.
However, while posting those four
losses. the team began to see some
real improvement and turned in per~
formances which were far and away
better than last weekend's [Duma-
ment at Iowa Wesleyan. The team
posted several firsts for the year in
their doubleheader with Marycrcst,
and against Knox they were JUSI. one
run away from their first victory.

In last Thursday's games against
Marycrest,thepitchingsiaffrecorded
its first complete game ofthe year as
Tera Jones went the distance in the
12—4 loss. in the second game, the
defense was able to hold the oppo-
nents below double figures for the
firsttime this ycaras Andrea Leonard
and Emily Parker shared pilching
chores in the 8-2 loss.

Grinnell‘s first home run of the
season came in the second game when
freshwomanKatieSommerhitatwor
run dinger to provide the offense for
the team. Grinnell nearly kept up
with Marycrest in the hit department
as they slapped out22 hits, compared
to 23 for Marycrest. Amy Fort, Tera
Jones, and Karin Walleslad were other
big boosts for the offense, as they all
went 3 for 7 during the two games.
Terra Geiger contributed a 3 for 8
performance.

Coach Lori Sadewaier was pleased
that the offense picked up from last
weekend but hopes the team can con
glomerate their hits together a little
better in order to score more runs.

The Pioneers were finally able to
play in frontoftheirfriends and peers
last Saturday when conference rivals
Knox came to town for a double
header. Once again the Grinnell ofr
fetise struggled. but in the second
game, the team was able to enipi with
six runs in the sixth inning, nearly
catching Knox.

The first game began poorly, not
an all the way Grinnell hoped to ini~
tiate the home season. Knox rolled to
an easy 8'1 victory. Tera Jones started
the game and Emily Parker came on
in relief in the third inning.

The Grinnell batsjumpod into life
in the second game, but they still fell
short 1079. “Walks always will come
brick to haunt youithat’s something
I‘ve always believed. This game to
tally exemplified that," Sadewater
said afterthegame. lnGrinnell’s six~
run sixth inning, Knox walked four
Grinnell batters, all of whom scored.
But the most devastating walk of the
game was the walk which pushed the
winning Knox runner across the plate
in the bottom of the seventh inning.
During the course of the two games.
Knox received a total of 26 walks,
compared to only 12 given to the
Pioneers. Andrea Leonard took the
loss in the second game but pitched

all seven innings to record the first
complete game of her collegiate ca-
reer.

AgainstKnox, AmyFortandTen'a
Geiger were once again the offensive
leaders for the team, as they both
went} for6 for the weekend. Sopho-
more Megan White had a ﬁne offeni
sive showing, as she went 4 for 7 in
the two games.

“I am seeing improvement in this
team, and I‘m actually quite pleased
with the games we played against
both Marycrest and Knox," said
Sadewatcr after the game. She also
dished out praise to Maude Logsdon,
whose fantastic defense in right field
was a big reason Grinnell was able to
stay close with Knox.

The high amount of hits against
both Marycrest and Knox were good
news for Pioneer batting averages
after the below average performance
at the lowa Waleyan tournament.
Terra Geiger leads the team with a
,395 average, Jones is at ,368.
Logsdon is at .355, and following
close behind is Amy Fort's .325 pace.
S ince the lowa Wesleyan tournament,
Grinnell’s average is at .291, while
opponents are hitting at a .403 clip.

The games against Maryerest and
Knox give me Learn an optimistic
outlook for the remaining games.
Despite their 0-16 record, the Pie-
neers will continue to search for their
firstwin. Next Tuesday the team will
be matched against Mt St. Claire at
home at 3:00.

Pioneer tennis team
evens record at 3—3

By Alan Jeffers

The Grinnell men‘s tennis learn
took a tworday weekend road trip to
Wisconsin, during which they lost
their first match to defending confer-
ence champion Ripon and then came
back to win a close match with
Lawrence College on Saturday.

Against Ripon. which has estabr
lished a virtual tennis dynasty for the
last 8 years, Grinnell lost 9.0_ Junior
concaptain Mark Reynolds played in-
spired tennis, losing atthe one spotin
a match so close that it defied the
imagination. After slaving off two
match points, defending conference
singles champion Steve Sprinkman
ofRipon came back to beat Reynolds
76 (7‘2), 476, 776 (86).

Coach Dave Arsenault labeled the
match as “the best l've seen Mark
play”. The Markman attributed his
stellar play at least in part to a red hat
he wore. “Ijustplay better tennis with
this hat,” hcsaid. In anexhibition set.
Zach Dictz of Grinnell pummeled
Chuck Larson of Ripon 672. He lost
the first two games, thrown off by

larson’s psychological mcties, ripped
his shirt off, to reveal his washboard
stomach, and won the next six games
en route to victory.

Grinnell beat Lawrence the next
day 574 in agrueling five-hourmateh.
Reynolds won at number one singles
in another three-sci match. Also tumr
mg in victories for Grinnell were
junior Alan “The Truth" Jeffers at
three singles, Senior Sieve “Big
Serve" Lowe at five singles, Junior
Johnny“V.P."Brcntnallatsix singles,
and Reynolds and the Brentnall
Backboard at three doubles.

The Stevcstcr pulled out a tough
three set match, coming back from a
(r7 (4—7), 2-5 deficit, after slaving off
a match point against him. The team
agreed that the phenomenal tum-
around was triggered by another Cf||r
cial hat manuever, Lowe reversed his
“rally” cap and his conﬁdence and
came back to win, 6-7 (4-7), 775, 672.
JuniorJason”Dr.W"Wagnercruised
to an easy victory in a “fresh“ exhibi»
tion singles sct,mentzillyoverwhelm»
ing his bewildered opponent.

Coach Arsenauli was satisﬁed with

the team's victory. “I'm glad we beat
those guys. Itwould havebeenalong
ridehome,(withoutthewin)",hesaid
afterwards, Grinnell now standsat3-
3 on the year, perhaps reﬂecting the
high caliber of opponents so far.

The men have notched Victories
against Central, Wartburg, and
Lawrence, while losing to UNI,
Wartburg, and Ripon. It was espe
cially satisfying to finally beat
Wartburg afterlosinganaway match
with Ihem early in the season, there
was some inspired doublesplay from
seniors lan “Breakfast in Bed"
Gustafson and “Primetime” Wagner,
who along with Reynolds and
Brentnall in singles recorded
Grinnell‘s only bright spots in the 3A
6 loss.

Jeff “Suirmaster” Lahti showed
potential at the five slot, playing in
shorts borrowed from his opponent.
Carried by some Strong play at one
doubles from concaptain Jeff
“Ballbreaker” Wooten and Reynolds.
Grinnell scraped out a satisfying vic~
tory over Wartburg.

“A great win," said Arsenault.
