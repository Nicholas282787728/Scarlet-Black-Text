Wrestling, Baseball Retained

by Mark Hanlsch

The varsity wrestling and base-
ball programs will he continued ior
at least this year. The Student-
l-‘aculty Physical Education Com.
mittee voted Monday to recommend
to the administration that baseball
be retained; its decision on wrest‘
ling was made last week.

The committee's investigations oi
the programs stem irom a sugges—
tion made last spring by the admin-
istration that wrestling and base
hall be discontinued on the grounds
that not enough students were par.
ticipating to yustiiy the cost. Alter
the Physcial Education Department
questioned the suggestion, the ad—
ministration asked the Physical Ed-
ucntion Committee to consider the

matter by interviewing both students
and coaches for their points or view.
President Leggett stressed that lhe

administrators are neutral on the
matter and merely Wanted to “raise

it (the iates oi the two programs)
as an issue" The motion to ape
prove the schedules oithe two sports
will probably he made at the next
iacnlty meeting
Basis oi Complaint

Almost all of the people involved
in the situation cited two
reasons why these two act

were singled out [or scrutiny. First.
in recent years the teams’ success
against other schools has been any-
thing but respectable. Wrestlers

have a string of forty four consecu»
tive dual meet losses, and lhe oase-
,ball team has not won a conference

game since l970, Many oi these de—
feats carried the added Sting Ofems
barrassing lopsided scores.

Also, an alleged “lack of student
interest" in the programs was point-
ed out At the end of last year's
seasons, only nine wrestlers and
thirteen or fourteen baseball players
were participating in the sports
whose approximate budgets were
$870 and 31l34 respectively

The committee formulated its
wrestling recommendation aiter
conducting an hour and a half “fact
finding" meeting on Seplember 23
During this time, Wrestlers Bob
Donelan, Rick Nightingale, and Ar
nie Peters and former coaches Maus
rice Hunt and Mario Bognannospoke
in behalf of the program In addis
tion, student Committee members
Steve Schroeder and Mary Jane
Elam presented the results of 0p-
inion surveys that lhey conducted
John Pfitsch, who has been With
the PE Department since 1943,
provided historical iniormation.

The Grinneil Philosophy

The Committee’s rationale for con—
tinuing the wrestling program cons
tained four points that emerged from
the meeting

The group noted that in the first
place, “there is a renewed inter-
est in athletics in general among
this year’s ireshmen. in view oi
this, now would seem an inoppor-
time time to drop an established
sport.” Nine freshmen that respond-
ed to Elam‘s questionnaire indicated
that they were interested in varsity
wrestling, The committee felt, sec-
ondly, that these nine wrestlers plus
the nine veterans “give at least
the potential for a competitive team
during the upcoming season.”

Grinnell's attitude and philosophy
toward athletics provided the basis
{or the last two points. The Com—
mittee said that “the merit of the
wrestling program should be iudged
not on the wunslost record of the
team but rather on the opportunity
it provides for students to parti-
cipate in this particular competi-
tive sport and its contribution to
the entire athletic program
It is felt that wrestling is a necs

Grinnell came out on the losing
end, both physically and inthescore
column, after last Saturday's tussle
with Cornell in Mt. Vernon. The
final score was 52713. Anexcellent

Baseball

One committee member reported
that the rationale behind the recomr
mendation to continue the baseball
program is “virtually the same”
as that for wrestling. The “fact
finding" meeting on baseball was

also very similar to the previous .

one on wrestling, Coach Ray Boyd
and players Steve Varys, Bill John»
son, and Mark Hanisch expressed
the View that baseball should be
retained as an intercollegiate sport.
Also, ireshman Craig Zippe brought
a petition bearing the names of
seventeen freshmen who “would ens
joy participating on an intercolle-
giate baseball team," and Schroeder
presented the opinions or the play-
ers he interviewed about the pro
grain.

The wrestling program “can not
be adequately maintained without a
proiessional coach” was the com-
mittee's final comment in its let-
ter to the administration

Under present Midwest Conference
rules, Bognanno and Hunt can not
coach because they are members or
the admissions staff. Pfitsch said
that Grinnell has tried to have this
rule dropped tor the past three
years, and that there is “no chance
in Hades” oi its being dropped this
year.

The six members of the Physi~
cal Education Committee are: the
Chairman of the Special Programs
Division, Pfltsch; the Chairman oi
the PE Department, Sandra Hoth;
two outside iacnlty members, Tom
Brozoski (Psychology) and Charles
Jepsen (Mathematics); and two slur
dents, Schroeder and Elam. Jepsen
is chairman of the committee.

Pioneers lose Tough Race

The Pioneer crossscountry team
went after its 20th straight dilals
meet victory Saturday, but lost a
very close race to Cornell, 23-32.
Although nearly the entireteambet—
tered their previous times, Cor-
nell ran a better tactical race and
broke the streak for Grlnnell.
Realizing that the two teams were
pretty evenly matched in ability,
Coach Dbermiller wanted Dan Hildes
brand to go out slowly,'then try to
burn oil as many Cornell runners
as possible in the anand 3rd miles.
Meanwhile Grinnell was to hangback
the first two miles, then run hard
and take the lead in the 3rd mile,
At this point Cornell would hope-
iully be tiring irom having iollowed
Hildebrand’s pace.

In the race itsell, Dan carried out
his part in theplan,winning in 20:46.
