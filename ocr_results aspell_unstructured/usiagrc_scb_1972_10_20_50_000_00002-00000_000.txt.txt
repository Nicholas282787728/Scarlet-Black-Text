Man With The Texaco Star

by Tom Grauman

He looks like your ordinary gas
station attendant, a nice guy with the
“lowa” drawl who does a good job
at doctoring your car. But Lawrence
Beauregard “Bo" Battey (of the
Texaco Greyhound station) is a man
who has lived his forty-two years
.to the hilt. His experiences encom-
pass more than most lifetimes,
ranging from the heights of a bat
manure truck driver to the depths
of a Grinnell College student.

Bo was reared in the opulent con—
fines of Weatchester County along
the Hudson River in NewYork State.
One of' his early recollections is
watching his father, a lawyer for
anew York City firm. sprinting in
his office attire for a rapidly de—
parting commuter train. in 1546.

President Roosevelt appointed Ho 5
father to the position of Assistant
Commissioner of Patents. As WWII
was drawing to a close, the Battey
family gratefully departed from
Washington and settled in Oskaloosa,
Iowa. By September of 1948, no
found himself on the Grinnetl College
campus.

“1 matriculated at Grinnell
College, Whatever that means," Bo
relates philosophically, However,
he never saw another semester at
Grinneil. "Oh, I loved it. [had too
much fun." Not only was his plea-
sure capacity an obstacle but he had
been waging a war with education
since kindergarden and simply
"couldn't see it for applesauce”.

Although he only inhabited the cam-
pus for a solitary semester, 50 et-
fected a change to which we'all
should be grateful. His freshman

- class decided that hazing was an

unnecessary requirement for grad-
uation. A contest was established to
settle the matter. Sandbags were
deposited at the 50-yard line or the
football field and freshmen battled
upperclassmen in attempting to se-
cure the sandbags in their own end
zone. The results of the insurrec<
tion were tainted by the hospital-
ization of six students.

Another comical episode that EU
recalls concerns the antics of an
initiation About 200 students
dressed as Indians in turkishtowels
ambushed the 2a. in. passengertrain
at the Grinnell depot The engineer

eventually became enraged and
ordered the tribe off. Unfortunately,
for one soul, nature had come its
way at an inappropriate moment and
by the time he was prepared to
deboard, the train was well on its
way to lowa City with the turkish-
toweled Grinnell Indian aboard.
Following his stint at Grinnell
College, Bo flew to his uncle's
house in Nevada‘s gold country to,
seek out his fortune. in all, Bo
spent the ensuing twenty years in
Nevada as it jack of all trades. His
occupations included selling pe-
tunias, operating a gas station,
a souvenir shop, a camera shop,
a theatre, operating the controls of
the hydroturbine generators at Boul-
der Dam and driving the dumptruck
of bat manure, The manure, mined
in a cave on a cliff in the Grand
Canyon was valuable as a fertilizer
due to its high nitrogen content,
Bo’s return to Grinnell was
prompted by his desire to permit
his children to develop in an environ-
ment in whichthey might savor some
Americana--such as a snowstorm or
a cornfield. Today Eo’s son Bill
works with him, his ldayearaold
daughter is at Grinnell high school
and his son of eleven years is ill
the Newburg school system. In re-
viewing his life, Bo acknowledges
that his adventuresome approach to
finding his niche may be a difficult
path, but in his case, it has proven
to be a very gratifying formula.

Foster Grandchildren Help
lonely Grinnell Elderly

by Bob Ekhart
Iowa has the second largest per-
centage of senior citizens (65 years

of age and older) of any state in

the United States. The town of Grin-
nell also has many older people, and
a large number or these live in
local nursing.homes. The Foster
Grandchild program is an attempt
to get Grinnell students into the
nursing homes to visit some of
these older people

The program began last year under
the direction of Gwen Carter, who
worked with Mrs. Simerman from
the town’s Department of SocialSer-
vices. The program beganlateinthe
year and faced some additional first
year problems, but showed that such
a program Could be successful. This
year Mrs. Simerman is again super-
vising the program. with Bo Ec-
kardt acting as student li son.
Hopefully some of last year's prob-
lems can be avoided this year.

The, basic idea behind Foster
Grandchildren is very simple: older
persons in local nursing homes are
contacted by Mrs. Simerman, who
explains the program and asks if
they are interested in participating.
Each student who has expressed an

study lounge. All those inter~
ested, students and faculty,
should leave their name’andbox
number and 50C with Nina as
soon as possible, as only the
iirst so people Willbe admitted,

interest in the program is then given
the name of a person in a local
nursing home who has also
expressed an interest. The student is
then expected to Visit his Foster
Grandparent at least once a week for

"about one hour. Students are also
encouraged to remember their
Foster Grandparents on holidays.

Activities on a visit may vary
greatly. One week the student and
Foster Grandparent may only talk,
another they may play a game, a
third they may go for a walk or
sit Outside. By this interaction, the
Foster Grandparent will see that
Someone Cares about him. This can
mean a great deal to someone in a
nursing home.

This type at program can have
benefits for both the student and the
older person. The program has a
great deal of potential. Hopefully it
can be expanded to include more
students and townspeople. Even if
all the people in nursing homes had
Foster Grandchildren, there would
still be many older persons living
in their own homes who could bene—
tit from this program. Hopefully this
program will become part ofthetra-
dition of student volunteer work in
the town of Grinnell,

Washington, D.C.~PeterHackesof
NBC News has comealongwayirom
the hallowed halls of Grinnell Col-
lege to the much more majestic,
if somewhat less hallowed, halls
at government in Washington It is
almost as great a distance as that
between being editor at the Scarlet
and’ Black and anchor man for the
1972 election returns forNBCradio.
Next week he returns to Grinnell
for the third time since his graduaa
tion in 1948 as the guest of Mrs‘.
Herbert Prescott.

The College Hackes remembers
was “a much smaller place, about
seven hundred fifty students,”

where being caught by the freight'

train that ran through campus was
a legal excuse for being late to
class, “just like breaking a leg.”

“The freight train was not the only
thing that was different. "You mean
the Rock Island Rocket doesn't stop
at Grinnell anymore? 0, no!”
Hackes arrived on campus just
before World War II. An army of—
ficer’s unit had taken overthe men's
dorms so Hackes and his fellow
male students lived in Read Hall‘-
“quite a shocking thing," Hackes
says, for those days before even
the North and South ends of the
campus let alone dormitories were
co-ed. ,

"I guess the biggest thing we used
to do for kicks was take a date
out to Merrill Park in those days
or to the goll course or some-
thing," says Hackes. ,“We used to
-»God, it seems tame Stuff- -we used
to go on hayrides. They ever have
a hayride out there now?’

“We unfortunately didn't have gold-
fish swallowing, and‘we were too
soon to get pantyaraiding,” Hackes
said, “But we had other things.
The freshmen used to occupy our
time, We had freshmen hazing»-
stupid as hell,"

ern in the November election, while

Semester Break or on Election Day.
Most students Said they could not

most ZOO indicated that they would
be willing to work on November ’7.
However, some of these indicated
that their working would be de-
pendant upon faculty action cancell-
ing classes for the Election, It was
uncertain what effect the Faculty's
action Tuesday would have on the
actual volunteer turnout.

P eter Hackes

Hackes' assignment as a freshman

was to go out and get a quart of
horse piss, and have it analyzed.”
So another guy and i went out,
and we saw a horse. And we just
waited until something happened and
went running Over with a bucket "

Then they took it, at Z a.m., to
a vet. He had been waked up time
and again by other guys in the past
and, Hackes says, “he didn't even
look at it--he just said, ‘This horse
has diabetes.’ "

Another freshman assignment,
Hackes recalled, was sending guys
downtown to tame the lions at the
Poweshiek Bank,

Hackes left Grinnell tor the Navy
after his freshman year. Then he
returned after the war to finish
and to be an editor of the Scarlet
and Black and president of the glee
club.

Alter that he took a degree lnjour»
nalism at Iowa City and worked for
a while at ’11, Midwest radlo station
called KROS, which he left when he
found out the call letters stood for
Keep Right [in Smilln’. Since, evenr

.tually, to CBS as a writer. then to

NBC.

Hackes, exhibiting that versatility
of expertise -common to netiiork
journalists, made the iollowing obr
servation, among others

On McGovern: "He’s a very unloi»
tunate choice as a candidate. I say
this, not because I don’t like him,
