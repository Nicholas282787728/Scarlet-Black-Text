MUSIC FEATURED
IN COMING PLAY

Mendelssohn Selections icilow Theme
and Fairy-Like Atmosphere.

A great deal oi attention is being
paid to the artistic in the “Midsum-
mer Night's Dream," The music,
which is to be playctl by the college
orchestra, under the direction oi Prof.
G. L. Pierce, is very iamous and many
or the numbers are played as separate
at concerts. The music
helps to carry out the fairy-like at—
mosphere and also connects the varlr
ous elements or the play, such as the
fairy music and the Bergomask dance
of the clowns.

The music was written zit two dif‘
lei'ellt times; the overture, when Men-
delssohn was only eigsteen years old.
and the rest, many years later at the
request oi the king of Prussia. It
consists ol twelve numbers, many or
which are well known, such as the
Nocturne, the Fairy March, and the
Wedding liarcli. Almost all or the se-
lectioiis are hinted at in the Overture.
There is a hint at the Fairy March
and one hears the braying oi an ass,
as a suggestion o: Bottom.

There is also a chorus of singing
rniries, lead by Phyllis Lehmer and
Margaret Jean Howell, as the first
and second fairies. The rest or the

chorus consists of Maxine Smith.Mad- »

elcino Johnston, Frances Kirkpatrick,
Gertrude Wensel, Elizabeth Campbell.
Arline Urban, Rowena Hawley, Vir-
ginia Swisher, Eva Adams. Hone Hus
ton, Ardis Adams, Bernice Mendele
sohn, Beatrice Marvin, and Lydia
Thicdcman.

The various dances in the product-
ion are entirely composed by Miss
Andersen. The outstanding ones
are the dance of the fairies and the
Bel'gomask dance by the clowns. The
costumes are very elaborate and are
being used liy Miss Andersen. with the
help of the senior normal class and
the play production Committee.

The fairies are Cleve Leeper, Ruth
Stokes, Mil-lam Itickards, Eleanor
Dunton, Zona Stevenson, Harriet
Naumau, DeEtte White, Pauline Crook,
Ruth Gordon. Lois Wilson, Esther
Taylor, and Louise Barton.

The actors are being trained by Mr.
Angus to give tinality to the beauty
and artistic iinish to their lines. A
group or clowns furnish much or com~
edy element. Brewster Woodburn, as
Bottom, is especially clever.

Schultz Tolls Women's Place.

"There is not any large ﬁeld tor

day. that is, there are not many jobs
with which college women would be
satisﬁed," said in Gladys Denny
Schultz oi the D. s Moines Register
stall in a short talk to the Iowa Col—
lege Press association convention this
morning. ‘

Mrs. Schultz said that the city news»
paper writers should regard journal-
ism as just a “great experience,” that
one should not stay in the game past
the age of thirty-ﬁve. A man is done
in journalism when he reaches forty-
iire and a woman at forty, she stated.

Mrs. Schultz said there were great
opportunities, however, in the syndi-
cate, ieature, executive, business, and
small town newspaper ﬁelds. “Thrills.

Mrs. Schultz enumerated the things
she would do if starting over in the

entering the writing game should

the great papers consider this element.

“Second, he as agreeable as possi~

“Third, give the boss what he wants

to do.

“Fourth, don't work too hard on the

“Filth, have a attitude of learning

Steiner Urges
Local Leaders

Tells Seniors Friday Graham Lend-
erslup Is Not Necessary.

“College does not require that its
graduates become God-burn leaders,
but it does require that they become
so trained that the communities with
which they come in Contact are the
better ibr their having been there,"
said Dl‘. E. A. Steiner in his address
at senior chapel, Friday morning.

In continuing Dr. Steiner made the
statement that the college had no
quarrel With the occupation the grad-
\ldte chose, but be emphasized the that
tllitt it dill have a quarrel With What
sort of a man he made in this occu-
Potion.

“It is our business to train
leaders, although we‘do not require
that they innuencc history," he said.

He pointed out to the seniors the
necessity oi making the most oi their
last four weeks of school and oi
their squaring themselves with them-
selves aud the world, making “sen"
predominate {or the time and letting
other thoughts slide under.

Speaking or the qualifications or
"gestures" oi a leader he stressed
three important points: ”The first re-
quisite of a leader,” he said, “is that
he plit the whole or himselt into his
tnsk." The second'“gesture" neces
sary to a leader be listed as the ous-
lities oi irankness, openness and trust-
worthiness. Laying emphasis on the
necessity or truth, be said, “I would
rather suffer for theit than suitei- tor
a lie."

The third and most important “ges-
ture" of a leader he put forth as the
“gesture of growth.“ Because at reo-
pect and reverence 'Eor the pioneers of .
Iowa and because we are living "on
virgin soil” he telt this qualification
to be at the utmost significance.

In conclusion he said, "We must be
born again, stri ng out of weakness
to become sons and daughters of the
living God and worthy successors to
the pioneers. "
