demanded that the old banners be flauntcd anew. Refer-
ence w node in an article in the SCARLII’ app BLACK,
under dale oi October 28 to the effect that charges on
articles loaned by the college to students for decorative
purposes were not only excessive but were not compatible
with the Grinnell family spirit, It has been brought
out since that in one concrete instance a very valuable
and beautiful painting was irreparably damaged by cer-
tain nnhhon-n persons, the obvious inference being that
had there been a rental placed on the loan of this [mints

ing the act or vandalism would never have occurred.

cslillg, it is quite certain that the picture in question

some hi0 years ago. Singular that the removal at such
a beautiful and valuable picture should not have been
noticed untd so long alter it was displaced.

There is no doubt that the students who made the
Dramatic Art rooin ready for the commencement dance
last spring were in error uhen tllcy tailed to put barb

WHERE’S THE mxm

Four times during the last tow Weeks Grinnell has
sent a football team away from home and each time a
pop meeting has been held at the station in an attempt
to give the men a rousing scud-uil. On each or those
oec ons the cooperation of the band would have boon
a distinct asset toward the promotion and maintenance ,
of the spirit necessary to make those meetings a success.
Each time such cooperation has been notoriously con—
spicuous by its absence.

There was much walling last spring because the band
was not recei ihg enough money to keep its members in
unirornis and instruments. The hand mild: co'iections
this tall by osltiiig ior contributions horn spectators at
the homecoming game It the band is to keep faith
with the ones lrom whom it rcecivcd lllone} it must begin
to show that it is uilung to help when it can Seieral
times the band has been called together to drill but
not more than hall of the members hare rcsponded to
the summons. Surely thcro i, no thought of sending
the bond on a trip when it has failed so signally in its
primary purpose.

Grinnell is iustly proud ot the band when it does play
{or she knows it compares ravorahly with the lmlsulal
organizations of other campuses. But Gruinell wonders
just a bit why the band is in hiding. T. L

WHAT yoid get out of a pipe
depends on what you feed it.
Millions of contented jimmy-
pipers will tell you that Prince
Albert commands a pipe to stand
and deliver. You suspect you are
in for some grand pipe-sessions
the minute you get a whiff of
P.Ai’s aroma.

The ﬁrst pipe-load conﬁrms
your suspicions. What a smoke,
Fellows! Remember when you
asked for the last dance and she
said ”You’ve had ill”? P. A. is
cool, like that. And sweet as know—
ing that she didn’t really mean it.
