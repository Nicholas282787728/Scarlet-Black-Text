Stuart named Career Service head '

by Dick Gilbert

Deb Stuart. RA for Younkers and
Smith, was named as new Director
of Career Services Monday,
replacing John Adams, who
resigned to take a position in
Chicago.

A replacement for Susan Green
Crim, who has resigned as
Associate Dean of Student Affairs,
has yet to be announced Stuart's
appointment is also effective July
1.

The search for a new Career
Services director began in
February with a nationwide ads
vertisement that attracted over 100
responses. The field was even-
iually narrowed to one external
and three internal candidates
After interviewing these four, the
decision was made Comments
Dean'of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman, “We discovered that
the inside candidates were every
bit as strong as the outside ones."

Adams, Grinnell’s first and only
full-time Career Services director.
announced his resignation in
January. He will go to Chicago
where his wife received a position
as project consultant in the branch
services division of the CNA
Finance Corporation, Adams plans
to go into private business as a
career counseloribaslcally the
same job he does at Grinnell

An internal search is currently
being conducted to replace Susan
Green Crim. who is lcaving to
become Dean of Student Affairs at
Cornell College The field has been
narrowed to two candidates. Susan
Wittpenn, an RA, and Assrsiant
Dean of Student Affairs Barry
Hull.

Hull and Wittpenn must now be

question Huff and Wittpenn, Then,
the two will be interviewed by
Student Affairs Office members
Adams, Green Crim, and Ray
Obermiller. Finally, Dean of the
College Waldo Walker and
Tederman will interview the
candidates.

Tederman hopes the posuion Will
be filled by one of the insiders. He
feels lack of experience at Grinnell
could prove to be a handicap. If the
interviews go well, he hopes to
announce an appointment within
two weeks,

However, if neither Huff nor
Wittpenn are offered the job, the
college does have the option of
launching an external search.

Green Crim has been at Grinnell
for lour years, and was promoted
to Associate Dean last year,
