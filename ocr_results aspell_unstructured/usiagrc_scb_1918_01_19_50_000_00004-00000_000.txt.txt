DORMS DEVELOP
ENGLISH SYSTEM

Draw Out Social Life by Closer
Intimacy of Men

That Grinnell's dormitorieslviu dEv
veloping the community spirit, are
serving the principal aim of the En-
glish educational system. was the
statement of President item in chapel
yesterday.

"English education is founded on

human principles: Its ehief aim is to
make a ntan a gentleman. The best
deﬁnition of a gentleman is the golden
rule.
“By bringing the students into clos-
er lationships, the dormitories are
se 'ing a wonderful purpose. One of
their distinctive features is the devela
opnient of community spirit and life.

“Social life is fundamental to_the
English education. A man living in a
room by himself is not really going to
college and he excludes himself from
the education that comes from com»
inunity act' 'liies."

In closing, Protessor ilain appealed
to the understanding and common
sense of the students to make self-
government in the dormitories a suc-
cess.
