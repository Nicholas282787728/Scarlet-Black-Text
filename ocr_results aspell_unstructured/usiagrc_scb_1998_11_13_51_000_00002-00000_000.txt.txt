tics about the upcoming contest.

"Myfirstconccm is thatitis the first

sriirl, “Decomh played once already
this season. The Dome gets noisy and
hot. there is this whole aura ofpiaying
at the Dome. I hopc our kids are not in

it is to win two more football games.

said. “We really strive to get where we

Dunne agreed with Post‘s assess-
ment. “This point of the season, it is
fun, It takes a tremendous amount of
lime, effort and work, but it is a lot of
fun It is down to the best four teams in
the state of iowa. We will not be in-

Ford reportedly came to the
Humboldt County Sheriffs Ofﬁce in
Eureka, Calif, carrying a woman‘s
severed breast. He told authorities that
he had murdered four women and
dumped their bodies in waterways.

since Tammy 2yWicki's death, auz

tential suspects, but none ofthc leads
has led to an arrest.

Iflhc sky is clear here Nov. 17 ~
and iflocal residents are willing to
sacrifice some sleep to see the phe-
nomcnon — it's possible that there
will be a spectacular celestial dis—
play.

It will be what Sky BL Telescope

the Leonid, a meteor shower that in
the past has produced stunning py-
rotechnics in the years that coin-

which, all its most awesome, pro-

But not every year features a big
display.

“About every 33 years the Earth
passes through a particularly dense
pan of the stream ofparticles, and
on these occasions the number of
Leonid meteors can be much greater
than usual,"Cadmus noted in a sum-
mary prepared for The Herald-Reg-
istcr. “This might occur this year,

 

 

ill celebration of life

Family members stand at the coffin during funeral services
for retired Grinnell Middle School Principal Michael Fitzgerald,
who died Saturday, Nov. 7, at the age of 57. The services were
conducted in the middle school gymnasium. Steven Witt,

deacon of St. Mary’s Catholic Church was the celebrant. A)

student tribute to Mr. Fitzgerald was read at the service. A
memorial fund has been established, and contributions may
be sent in care of the Fitzgerald family.

the loss of a man named Michael .I.

A man who most, if not all of us
know and cared about. 1 know that I
did. I‘m not going to say that I knew
him like a father, because that honor
lies with l‘IIS children. But I did know
him as a student would know a princir
pal. And I know that he was a kind,
caring person. And he had a special
spot in his heart for everyone, whoever
passed through OMS on their way to
high school.

I know that there are some students

bitter at the time, But what that group of people should

understand is that he did it because he cared for them. He
wanted them to grow to be outstanding citizens. Not for
his personal pride, but for the pride of Grinnell Middle

School.

He loved this school. That’s all that really needs to be
said about it. He lovedthisschool. Andthat, I believe, was

why he was such a great man. Hc did things not for
himself, but for the collective whole ofGn'nncII Middle
School. You may notice I’m not wearing black; that’s
because I‘m afraid that ifI wearblack, I'll feel that I’m in
a dark mood, and I know that Mr. Fitzgerald wouldn't

it my all. Because last year when Mr. Fitzgerald was
working with me to try to get me motivated to go out there

and give all you do no percent.

Because ofhim I am doingu lotbcncrthis ycarandlam

but there is no guarantee."

Indeed, people here in Iowa are
less likely to enjoy the big show
than are people who live in Asia
and the Pacific area. Cadmus said,
though, that predictions aren’t very
reliable.

It should be noted that the mete-
ors don’t really come from the vi-
cinity of the stars in the Leo con-
stellation. The Leonid meteor
shower actually occurs because of
the fact that Earth passes through
the path of what astronomers long
ago dubbed Comet 55P/Tempcl-
Tultle.

Cadmus said that the meteors oc-
cur when small particles ofmck —
usually about the size era grain of
sand but occasionally much larger
— “strike the Earth‘s atmosphere
and burn up, streaking across the
night sky." .

Sometimes, increase is dramatic

“The paths of comets are littered
with these rock particles, so when
the Earth passes through one of

drum" women in new book Will meteor shower mean a big display?

these paths there is an increase,
sometimes a dramatic increase, in
the number of meteors. This is a
meteor shower," he said in his sum-
mary.

Astronomcrs haven't reached a
consensus as to whether the Le»
onids will be spectacular this year.
But ifa major display does occur, it
likely will happen during the night
of Nov. 17-18. Cadmus said it's
worthwhile to look for the meteor
shower during the early-morning
hours of both Nov. 17 and 18.

“Even if we do not see the best
part ofthe meteor shower, it is still
likely to be interesting," he added.
“There will be more faint meteors
than bright ones, so you should try
to watch from a location that is as
dark as possible. The best times
will probably be between I am.
and morning twilight. The meteors
could appear in almost any part or
the sky, but most of them will ap—
pear to be moving away from a
point over the eastern horizon.
