Friday, November IS. [949 SCARLET AND BLACK

h“ Where’s.» .y Cyclone?”

It’s at the printers . . . it’s been
there for some time. Mechanical dif-
ficulties have extended the publica-
tion date . . . pictures torn in the mail '

. . . retaking of pictures.

These difficulties have been over-
come and the Y49 Cyclone will be out

in December.

This year’s stuff has no control
over the ’49 book since the two books

are completely separate.

The 1950 staff has a sales dead-
line of November 28th . . . 10 days
from today. By that time 750 1950
Cyclones must be sold or there will
be no 1950 Grinnell yearbook. Publi-
cation date of the ’50 Cyclone is May
15th — You’ll have it to pack when

you leave next spring!
