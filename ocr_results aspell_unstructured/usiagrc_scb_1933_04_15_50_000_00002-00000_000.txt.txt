ONE HOUR FOR STUDY
According to college librd ions, the new hour-
ly reserve system is proving ll success. Students
are not forced to wait so long for reserve books,
and those books which flre checked out are not so
liable to be handed about, while the waiting list
fumes and fusses at the desk
Yet it is difficult to concentrate on a long
assignment in ll rcscrvc book, and at the same time,
keep track of the time so that the book may be
turned ill or reserved again at the end of all hour.
Librarians Say that there have been few fines usr
sesscd for invoking the hourly l'lllc, bllt perhaps
they have been ll bit lcnicnt when students were
only a few minutes tardy.
At one time ill the past, the library clock had
a chime which announced (lllal‘tel‘zllﬂll‘l‘s. If sonic
such system could be again installed, with a hell
or chime announcing lit least half-hours, students
with reserve books would he forcibly reminded of
the time, The system would also be aided by hav»
ing librarians stamp the time when the book was
reserved, not only on the card which is removed,
but on a sheet posted within the book7 so that

the stlldent could check with it while studying.

A FASGINATDIG DISPLAY

\Ve doff our hats to Grant 0. Gale, hand of the
physics depaltmcnt, and his assistants, for their
outstanding success in milking the department’s
fortietli diiliivcrsrny “open house” last night worth
while.

The huge crowd which attended the exhibit
and tho fflct that many persons spent three hours
or more, viewing the various demonstrations,
proves the success of the “open house” and is a
reward ill itself for all the work dollc by the de-
partment toward milking the exhibit worth whilc.

Mr. Gale has conclusively provcu that n coili-
plicatcd subject . loll as physics can he made intclu
esting and even fascinating to the uninformed
mind. Everyone ill attendance while perhaps not
inter Sted in cvc ' dcmonstl' tioii found many of
the e hibits especially attl'ltcti c.

If the other departments of the college would
work out exhibits such as this, the students in the
various departments would no doubt take more
intcrcst in their work, and it would provide a
welcome change from the round of classroom
routine. .

The fact that David Bair, Adi-ion Dunn and
Morris Brown wo {Gd until 4:30 Friday morning
ill preparing demonstrations .ol' the “open house”
may account for its really great succc

Other Opinions

‘IN THE SPRINGi

To paraphrase the well known line fioni Tennyson,
in the spring young people's fancy lightly turns to love
and cutting classes. Though spring has oearcely become
a reality yet, it won't be long now until sunshine and
warm breezes will have done their worst to interfere
with a, more or less staid college curriculum.

We suppose nothing can be done to interfere with
nature as far as romance is concerned, though studying
must go on and classes continue as seheduled. still
there can be a time and a place for each.

After every spring recess, professors sigh and la-
ment the vacant chairs in their classrooms. They are
sympathetic, to be sure, but they themselves have to
go on with their work, and the task of teaching half
a class at a time is scarcely inspiring, Moreover, com-
nnuning with nature does not accomplish a great deal
in making up for unattended lectures and stimulating,
guided class discussions.

This is the time to yield not to temptation, when
in the manner of “do Lawd” in “Green Pastures", we
should "‘renr back and pass a miracle" of resolution
to stick to the purpose of our coming to college. How to
the line, and let the cuts fall where they may.

CROSSING THE BAR
(Beloit Roundtable)

America is recovering from the effects of the
greatest. "wake" that this country has ever celebrated.
Prohibition was buried yesterday and Thursday night,
to the “keening” of a thousand muted trumpets, to the'
moaning of a million anguished saxophones, amid the
'wailings of hundreds of agonized torch singers, this
cadaver was literally washed into tht great beyond. it
need not be noted here that the great percentage of the
“refreshments” at this wake were just as illegal Thurs-
day night as they were the night before.

The late Prohibition probably hiceupped a sigh of
relief as he “crossed the bar." His brief sojourn on this
earth was not an especially pleasant one. Many claim
that the majority of the family did not welcome his
arrival in the first place but that they were so busy
thinking of other things that nothing was done about it.
Like Juno he sprang from the brow of Jupiter, full
al‘mediwith umbrella and stove pipe hat, He had
no normal adolescence, a fact that very possibly explains
his early demise.

His friends were perhaps his greatest enemies. They
worked not wisely but too well. For years they had
heralded his birth, but the minute the blessed event was
announced they dropped their eudgels and left the
prodigy to shift for himself.

Children will probably remember the deceased as a
”bogey man," for although he was never photographed,
the nation's cartoonists ehose him as their favorite
subject. They clapped a stovepipe on his head and slap-
ped a bulging umbrella in his hand; they gave him a
nuniber six nose; they hollowed in his cheeks and stuck
out his ehin; they put a crook in his back. They
picked up some rags in a nearby gutter and with these
they clothed old Prohib ion, steadfastly refusing to buy
him a new garb. They refused to give him a hair out.

In the other journalistic columns he was treated
no more fairly. He was blamed for a thousand rnurders
that he never committed; he was surrounded with a
corps of snoopers whom he would never have recog-
nized. They blamed him for an increase in crime; they
charged him with bloating the prison population; they
accused him of robbing the national treasury. They
either laughed at his supporters, the w. c. '1‘. U. and
the Antirsaloon League, or they gave them a paragraph
on the last page; meanwhile, the activities of the
Crusaders were front page news. A prohibition agent
killing was headlined; the story of a drunken brow!
resulting in murder was covered up.

No, long haired, shuffle footed Prohibition was
never given a break. He was probably the most
abysmal failure this eountry has ever known. His
house was but a flimsy scaffolding erected on the sands
and the surprising thing is that it lasted as long as it
did. A perfectly justifiable principle was sacrificed
because the form of its expression became an object of
ridicule.

Someday there will be another noble experiment.
Perhaps it will be expressed, not in terms of emotional
sentiment, but on sound sociological principle.

Thursday

Richard Steiner. who is taking his
father's place this semester as pro-
fessor of applied Christianity, read
the thirteenth chapter of the Gospel
of John, “A New commandment I
give unto you, that ye love one an-
other as I have loved you.”

“Since that Last Supper the core—
niony of moot-washing has been more
rigorously observed than the eom-
mandment itself, which was the real
message Christ was bringing to his
disciples that night. For all to obey
this, the hardest commandment that
man was ever called upon to accompr
lisli, would save the world,

“We have this choice, to be infect
ed with hate, or to go about spread-
ing an infectious love to humanity. if
this be the generation that seeks
Christ's face, the kingdom of Heaven
will surely come."

Editor, The Scarlet and Black
Dear Sir:

If there is anyone in Grinnell who
deserves the unqualified applause and
admiration of the student body it is
Joe Canard, chairman of the recent
conference on international Relax
tions. it is only those who worked
with him who know how long and
how hard and conscientiously be
worked. He did not start on this tre-
mendous undertaking a month ago,
or last September; he began in May
of last year to organize the commit-
tees, draw up the program and write
to the speakers.

I don’t believe, and I write entire-
ly as an individual and not as one re-
presenting any part of the conference,
that there is anyone who attended the
eonferenee, who would not say that
there was an excellent group of
speakers who gave us as stimulating
and intelligent an analysis of our
present situation as we could ask.
Surely this is what we need. for we
certainly will not always live in this
generally debilitating paradise of see
clusion from a world of responsibil-
ity and practical problems, but ap-
parently there were a great many
who do not want it.

On more than one occasion a cas»
ual glance over the audience showed
no Grinnell students. Of course some
were always there, but too many
times it was necessary to look for
them. With less than a hundred dele-
gates from out of town, Grinnell's
representatives should have made
them relatively inconspicuous in num-
bers, put this did not happen. Such
brazen indifference to the problems
of a world in which we pretend to

Unfortunately, or perhaps fortun~
ately—jllst as one views the charac-
tor of, and reason form most of the
awards on the campus—the college
makes no award to those with
achievements like those of the chair-
man of the recent conference. But
the credit is due in this instance and
to the chairman of the conference
next year, even though there is no
official recognition by any organiza-
tion which specializes in
awards.
