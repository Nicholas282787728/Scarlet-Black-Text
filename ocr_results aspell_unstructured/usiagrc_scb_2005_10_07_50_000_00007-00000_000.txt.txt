While most Grinnellians might anticipare leaving rhe small
town Iowa lire for a new world ormochachinos, poetry readings and
art galleries, some alums have found the best ofboth woilds heie in
Gtinnell.

According to the Ofﬁce ofAlumni Relations and Developmenr,
19o iilums have ended up in Grinnell since graduating, In particular.
MJ. Zimmerman ’56 and leff Phelps '7] have found satisfaction‘in
the home ofthen alma mater.

Zimmerman hasn't lert Grinnell since coming ro attend collegc.
She was raised' in a small town in western South Dakota; soon after
graduaring, she married Roger Zimmerman 55, who moved here
when he was twelve.

“He loved it and wanted to stay here, so I did,"said Zimmerman.
“The majority of[Grinncl.l College] snidenrs were from big cities in
the '50s; they couldn’t believe [my husband and I] were going to stay
here. But in ﬁve years when they came back they noticed the [high]
quality oflife they saw the children playing in rhe streers,"

Phelps, the owner of sainrs Rest Coffeehouse and Art Gallery,
grew up in Grinnell and rhen attended rhe college; he has been away
from the town for only two years. He lived in St. Charles, Me. for a
briefperiod during the 1970s, but decided he liked Grinnell more.

”I thought I would love [being away from Grinnell]," he said.
“1r was just a miserable place ro live .You can take the boy outta
the country, but you can’t take the country outta the boy.” Phelps
once owned a wine shop in town, but when the state licensed a local
grocery store ro sell liquor he was forced to change businesses. He
opened up Saints Rest on Broad Street in 1999 and owns it still. He
believes that he’ll stay in Grinnell for the rest of his life.

Zimmerman said that Grinnell is a “wonderful place to Livc.What
distinguishes this town from any other small community in Iowa is
the college. our children grow up with different attitudes because
of the students' attitudes." She also cited a cultural advantage in the
town due to the lectures and music provided by Grinnell college.

“My daughterprobably srared [rhe reason to stay in Grinnell]
best," Phelps said. “You can stay in Grinnell and let the world come
to you." Other reasons to stay ‘in Grinnell are the diversity due to the
college’s student body, the safety and its proximity to large cities.

However, like most have realized, Grinnell has ﬂaws. Zimmer-
man complained about the town’s education system. “One would
think that we as a community would be more committed to the
education of our children because of the college," she said. “Our hiss
tory has been until recenrly rhar we’ve snuggled for bond issues

to get schools.”

Phelps said he wished rownegown relations could improve.
“Sometimes people can be cliquish," he said. “Sometimes rhe folks
in town pigeonhole the students as one type of person or another

.lm surprised sometimes by the animosity between the town and
the college."

According to Zimmerman, students should feel ready to go any-
where after college,whether that means staying in Grinncll or going
elsewhere.

“Students make their own good choices,"5he said. “Ifthey don't
like their choices,they mov%becausc they’re so smart, they can do
anything.”

“I'd love for there to be opportunities for students to stay [in
Grinnell]; the opportunities aren’t that great," Phelps said. “I’m al-
ways surprised there are four or five students every year that ﬁgure
out a way to stay. They lower their expectations for income and den
cide that lifestyle is more important.”

As seniors begin to ponder where to go in the coming months,
perhaps some will decide that maybe it’s not such a bad idea to just
stay put. At least think about it over a cup of coffee with Jeff.
