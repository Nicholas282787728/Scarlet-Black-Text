Friday. December [5. I950

 

Spirited by Dunlop’s as points
Grinnell passed the smaller
Kohawks early in the first per.
led and were never headed, as
the Pioneers wrapped up its
conference inaugural 69—64. “The
entire team showed a big im-
provement in one week," was the
summarizing comment made by
the Pioneer mentor after the
game.

Coe tried, throwing both the
zone man and the man to man
defense against the 6-4 forward
but Duhlop, having one of the
biggest nights of his career,

nected for 40% of his shots,

Freyder again hit for ten points
while Teomey followed with‘
nine. i

Coach Pfltsch was particular-
ly impressed by the great deg
tensivc skill displayed by 5013th
omore Bob Dibble. The former
national Negro jumor champ
kept LaBarbara, one of the most
dangerous men in the center—
ence bottled up for three part
lods until he tired, and then the‘
Kohawks poured through eight
quick field goals in ll tries for
a pheneminal 72.7% shooting
average.
