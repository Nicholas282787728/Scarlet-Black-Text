Binlog‘isll Points Out That Carbon
Hydrogeny Oxygen, Nitrogen
Are In Living Matter.

“There are twelve chemical ele-
ments which play an immortal“. part
in the make up or protoplasm," Prof.
H. \V. Rand, Harvard exchange pro-
fessor, stated this morning in the
Second or his talks on experimental
biology.

"Four or these elements, carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen form
the greatcst part or it These com-
bine with each other to form dis-
lingllishing compounds. Fats and
carbohydrates are composed chiefly
of carbon, hydrogen ,and oxygen,
while proteins are characterized by
the presence or nitrogen in their
makeup.

"it has been estimated that the raw
materials composing the body at a
int-in is worth thir ,uninc cents. One
of the big questions or biology is
whether it is possible to make living
protoplasm out of these cheap mater
ials."

Describes Proiuplnsm

In speaking or the physical aspect
o! prutoplrtsm, Prof. Rand spoke
chiefly of the organ ation within an
individual cell. Under a micro-
scope 'a cell is composed at two
parts, the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
Both are composed of a clear, tran-
snlscent, jelly-like liquid. Sllspendr
ed in the liquid is a fine network
which seems to support small clumps
of material. Those in the nucleus
are called chromatins, and those in
the cytoplasm nlicrosomes.”

He spoke of the work of a German,
Butschii, who conceived the idea that
the network was really a bubble-like
(system containing the liquid. Be-
cause of the smallness oi the cells,
it is impossible to be positive or this.
due also spoke of some or the former
ilheorles which conceived of the rule-
trosolnes as giving life to the cells
and of the fine lines as being the liv-
ing part of the organism.

Prof. Rand will give his third les-
-ture tomorrow morning in long
chapel. He will elaborate on the But-
schll theory or protoplasm and w l
begin the discussion or the actiwties
in protoplasm.

War Must Be Avoided,
Nansen Says Monday

(Continued trom Passe 1)

throw themselves into what 1 call the
‘1)olicy or the League at Natibns.’
There must be no clinging to the old
rights or making private wars. We
must have no reservations. We must
leave no line of retreat to the old
methods. Tile Kellogg pact is an inls
portant step in that direction."

Dr. Nahsen's second means ot ate
taining world peace is to begin on
the inside and disarm the souls at
people. “There must he a complete
change in our international ideas."
he relt. “We must teach history dire,
terently from the old war and battle
way."

Dr. Nansen prefaced his lecture by
giving a picture of what war really
means, He told at the thousands of
prisoners after the war still ii in; in
Siberia, dressed in the same rags in
which they were taken prisoners tour
or five years before. When the
League of Nations came into being. it
gave to Dr. Nansen the responsibility
of getting the halt-million prisoners
home from Siberia. With the consent
or the Russian government, the great
task was accomplished at the cost of
less than a. pound per person.
