FAIR APPORTIONMENT?

Since Grinuell college studcllts pay in the
form of semester fees for campus activities, it is
no morc than fair that they should know how
that money is apportioned.

At a meeting Sunday. called for the purpose
of discussing the scm fcc proposition several in-
tcrcsting developments were brought to light. Of
the total amount, Slightly more than '50 percent
goes to the athletic department, 33 per cent goes to
the lecture and m ' course comhincd, leaving, the
remainder to be divided among such organizations
as the Y. W. C. A. and Y, M. C. A., band, debating
tcanl, \V. A. A., etc.

The question is, ill these times of economic di
tress, is it fair to grant a suln of approximately
$2000 to the music department for the four nulli-
hers on the Grinncll Music course while other de-
partments pare expenses to the bone? As has been
pointed 33 pcrccnt of the total goes to the music
and lecture courses, with the music course having
a budget of 22 percent leaving 11 percent for the
lecture course.

This year contracts were made in advance with
lecturers and artists, so that it. is impossible to
make any reduction now. This unwise, procedure
has left a burden on the shoulders of other depart
meuts, the chief sufferer being the department of
physical education.

Without question. athletics are the most suc-
cessful advertising medium that G"nncll could
possibly hope for. Although Grinucll 1 small. she
plays the leading colleges and univel. cs and
moreover holds her own with each. She cxcells in
football and basketball, and has earned the dis-
tinction of being “the greatest little traclc collegc
in the middlelvcst,”

Athletics havc cooperated splendidly this year
in helping out down expenses. They have taken the
reduction ill the athletic budget with all appl'cciar
tion of the financial difficulties of the time.

“’9 19k, then, is it not fair to cut down the
expenses a little in the music and lecture con '.
Even the elimination of one recital would involve
the saving of $400 or $500. and would go a long
way towards keeping Grinnell’s fine intramullll
sports program going, or save one of the minor
sports, tennis, cl 55 country, or swimming from

FRENCH HATS AND—THE some. nLEcTIou
(Iowa, State Student)

Button—button—Whe‘re is the button that: hold on
milady’s new French hat?

This cry is coming from a thousand distressed males
on the campus who are almost to the point of admitting
defeat in their Search to discover the secret of bat
balance this season.

The ladies of 1880 made no bones about the method
of securing their hats upon their heads, A huge hatpln
obviously did the work. and the men were at once put
at ease concerning the stability of their lady friends'
hats.

The co~eds this tall, however, go debonairily along,
hats tipped dangerously as'kcw'with no sign of a hat-
pin. Several have conjectured that the secret of the
balance is all in the tenet of hair that protrudes from the
posterior end of the shallow crown. Others believe that.
the veils with the huge "fly-specks" serve as ballancers.

But what do French hats have to do with the com-
ing presidential election? Just: this:

Hoover has made his stand clear on the bonus.
Roosevelt hasn't. Neither Hoover nor Roosevelt have
made their positions clear on prohibition. Now, if coeds
persist in wearing French hats, obviously the political
situation is involved.

If we have high tariff we have fewer French hats.
If we have low tariff the country is flooded with French
hats (made in New York).
