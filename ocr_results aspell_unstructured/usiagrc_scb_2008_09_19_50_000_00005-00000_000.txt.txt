Anti-authoritarian fantasy fun for the whole family

Film’s ambitious visuals fai
and uninspiring characters

ln T/JU Fall, the newest ﬁlm flom provoer
tive director Tarsem (77M Cull), some of the
most mesmerizing visuals (from 18 different
countries) ever ﬁlmed end up being weighcd
down by a convoluted and haekneyed seripr.
As the movie begins, inquisitive ﬁveeyear
ol<l Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) and srtinre
man Roy (Lee Pace) become friends in a Lns
Angeles hospital
after they both
have dangerous
falls. Hc begins to
tell her a story and
in the tradition of
thebesrepic fantae

harsh reality begin to melt logetl‘len Roy uses
other eha cters from the hospital and grabs
Alexandria's attention, but he has darker ino-
tives for the story that are eventually revealed
as he continues to tell it. The confrontation
between Roy's problems and the fantasy world
eventually collide in a conclusion that should
be devastating. Unfortunately, T/Je Farr never

in several disconcerting and iilexpl able oc-

Roy's narration also suffers from a general
lack ofcharacter development. While Roy and

a unique visual feast. Yet the confusing story

story with a bit more care,

For many an idealistic Grinnellian. the idea
ofa place where you get your water from a well
and your power from solar panels might sound
like a perfect carbon-neutral paradise. In the
documentary Oﬂzhe Grid, ﬁlmmakers Jeremy
and Randy Stulherg explore a community of
outcasts. hippies and anarchists who live just
such a life on a mesa in New Mexico. However,
this is no utopian dream. The movie's tagline
is “25 miles from town.,. a million miles from
mainstream ’
society," and
the mesa
does indeed
seem to exist
outside the
b o u n d a r i c s
of law and
order.

On the
mesa, there are only two rulcs: don't steal from
your neighbor and don't shoot your neighbor.
People here have guns and know how to use
them. The economy of the mesa is mostly
based on pot and sometime harder drugs, so
the main threat to these peoe
plc's way oflife is the DEA, not
each other.

Inhabitants of the mesa
range from jaded war vctcrs
ans with names like Dreadie
Jeff and Maine to hippies like
Moonbow, who says he ate
tended both the elite high
school Exetcr and Princeton
before choosing to live outside
society Mama Phyllis was a
psychiatric nnrse belore move
ing to the mesa, which she describes as “the
world’s largest outdoor insane asylum." The
mesa also attracts teenage runaways like Vii"

The main conﬂict in of {In- Gr'irl comes

Film offers unique look at

The animated film Pore/orb, the culniral
ﬁlm for this week, is based on the autobio—
graphical graphic novel of Frenchelranian
Mariane satrapi and pulls offrhat rare trick of
being both emotionally powerful and visually
unique,

Unlike live-action movies, and to an em
tent, the computer-animated films of Pixar,
"carroons" like port/ore are both blessed and
culsed by their abil
ity to construct just
about .lny image
they want. But here,
the ﬁlmmakers seem
well aware of the eye
erepresent potential
{or ahus . Rather
than falling into the
trap of grandiose
graphics, Sarrapi purposerully rransrcrred the
zen quality of her graphic novel to the silver
screen, gifting audiences with the capacity to
cultivate their own third dimension of emo»
tional meaning.

Small, efl‘ecrive doses of whimsy charge
the ﬁlm with charisma, like when Satrapi dos
piers puberty in a series ofoxaggcratcd, grossly
funny bodily deformations. At the same time,
Pul.rU/)0/It feels no need to sugarcoar the severe

man and bears him through the streets. Later,
an adolescent Marjane visits her heroic, pro-
gressive uncle in prison by herself, no doubt
knowing that it may he the last time she ever
sees him.

By engaging the viewer with honesr scenes
of political and reli-
gious strife, the film
effectively conveys
the absence of peace
in Iran as well as in
Marjane's life,
berry and poli cal
awareness clash to set
up the srark contrast
between Marjanc in
iran and Marianc in Vienna and France, where
lethargic teens bounce anarchistic quips back
and roirh like a hacky sack,

Although clearly based on an episodic
graphic novcl, Persona/Lt weaves the emotional
events or Mariane’s life into a visually titres!-
ing nanarive, lvlarjane's constantly developing
notions of identity and independence make for
an impressive account ofnn equally impressive
woman.
