“BIGGER AND BETTER”

“Last year many students said we had a
fine lecture course, but demanded that the
series this year be even ‘bigger and better than
everY ," Professor E. B. T. Spencer said yester—
day after releasing news of the Coming lecture
by William Beebe. “We're giving it to them,"
he added, with a smile of pride over the engages
ment of So eminent.a personage as the famous
Scientist and author.

And undeniably the lecture course for this
year is attaining a standard higher than any
heretofore presented on the _Grinnell campus.

In Dr. Beebe, Professor Spencer has obtained
a man who has more audience appeal than any
lecturer to appear at G"nnell for many, many
years. There is 3 sp it of adventure back of
Dr. Beebe's experiences in “Davy Jones’ locker"
which appeals to every type of person, and pro»
mise of a peep into the mysterious world half
a mile down into the sea—through the medium
of the lecturer’s slides and moving pictureSvls
bound to arouse a keen general interest.

Lecturers by prominent scholars, educators
and diplomats have been presented in the past,
. almost to the exclusion of popular lecturers of
the type represented by Dr. Beebe. The value
to a student body of hearing such men as the
former is not to be overestimated, but a sip of
the wine of adventure along with a heavy meat
course of national and international problems is
highly desirable.

Professor Spencer is to be congratulated for
bringing Dr. Beebe to Grinnell.

G
HERE’S T0 PREPPING

Northwestern and Michigan universities have
been engaging in a spirited argument, through
the medium of their student newspapers, over the
place of the familiar prep cap in collegiate circles.

Michigan has abandonned the custom of en-

forcing its freshmen to distinguish themselves by
wearing the distinctive bits of felt, but North.
western insists they have a definite place in the
university social scheme.

Grinnell, apparently, supports the North-
western view—but its grounds for clinging to
the long established custom, and all that accom-
panies the wearing of prep caps, areabit
vague.

Prep caps, buttoning, hell week—the whole
system of ‘prepping’ appears to be without rhyme
or reason. Especially is this true here at Grin—
nell where fraternities are unknown and every
man is his school~mate’s equal, theoretically.

The “why” of it all seems to resolve upon
the fact that sometime in the dim, distant past the
upperclassmen took upon themselves to haze
the incoming freshmen. On the following year,
in the spirit of revenge, the sophomores support—
ed the idea and it was repeated; etc, etc, until
the point has now been reached at which some
future group of upperclassmen must be satisfied
to spare some incoming class of freshmen and
forget the humiliations they were subjected to,
or this revenge motive will result in the continua-
tion of prepping until the end of time.

We by no means intend to suggest that this
year’s freshman class and the men who will next
year be juniors and seniors should forego their
privilege of punishing the men of 1939 for things
of which they are guiltless. By no means! Take
eye for eye, tooth for tooth—and give swat for
swat. But at all costs don't think the matter
over, for its likely to make you feel not a little
Sheepish.

It’s a foolish, selfish custom.

TAKE A BOW

An orchid to Chairmen Lindquist and Lynn
and their very able assistants on the pop com-
mittee for their heroic attempt to joSile the Grin;
nell student body out of its lethargy and in—
still a bit of pep into its members.

It’s proving a tremendous task to recreate
on the ‘campus that "Grinnell spirit" which once

was traditional but has been so sadly lacking
of late. The pep committee refuses to say
“Quits,” however, and the pep fest held Friday
at least created more enthusiasm than has been
shown at any previous time this year.

Keep it up, pepsters, and perhaps your spirit
will ultimately prove contagious. The Grinnell
campus could certainly use a general epidemic
of pep to a very good advantage.

| Other Opinions

COLLEGIATE GRADS
(The Daily Illini)

For the iirst time in many years James Roland
Angeli, president of Yale university, addressed the grad-
uating class. The importance of his message made it
evident why he spoke.

“As I meet American college products,” he said,
“nothing is more depressing than to remark the astonish.
lug number who give absolutely no suggestion of intel.
ligent acquaintance with anything whatever ouside the
range of business and sport."

This type of criticism was more current during the
golden years of the big football games and hip flask
era. During the past few years there seemed to be a
change from the “collegiate" spirit to one that was more
concerned with affaiis of the day and tended toward
broader interests It was believed from this evidence that
the collegiate graduate was growing up.

Dr. Angeli subdivided his class of self-centered college
graduates into two types, and remarked that the most
distressing was the kind of college man "whose mental
and moral development appears to have been so early
arrested that he had never grown out of the juvenile col-
legiate attitude of mind." The other type was the gradu—
ate who was absorbed in his business or profession to the
exclusion of other things. "Gentlemen of this mentality
are at least men of mature mentality, but they are often
narrow, warped, onesided, in a meager sense educat—
ed, but in no sense whatever persons of urbane cultiva—
tion; and from this class I could not in conscience
exclude the scholar, the boundaries of whose intellectual
sympathies stop with his own speciality. Indeed the
scholar of this variety may be a peculiarly pernicious ex.
ample of narrow provincialisrn. He, too, needs the
balance aflorded by some vivid supplementary interest to
humanize him and take hirn out of himself.

This last class of warped development is not as evi—
dent as the stunted class. A member of the University
faculty in giving a group of graduates helpful bins in
applying for jobs cautioned them against this “collegiate"
attitude criticised by Dr. Angell. After they had secured
a job they were again cautioned to try and forget that they
were just out of college. The university faculty mem-
ber said that a college man ought to be able to be at
his position for at least three months without letting his
associates know through his conversation that he had
attended a university. Stenographers in some offices
were afraid to ask young graduates to move a type-
writer because they usually couldn’t do it without getting
several ci their dangling honorary keys tangled in
the mechanism. .

While it would be inadvisable to ask a college man
to forget his old connections upon graduation, he would
probably find it to his advantage to mingle with men who
had interests outside of his own particular fraternity or
university. Of course, he could not do this if he main.
tained his immature viewpoint of considering college
societies and football as the major things in life.

Another important asset to a college man, that Dr.
Angeli stressed, was in the possession of an open mind.
"One expects the uneducated man to be opinionated,
biased, and dogmatic—even unreasonable. But education
has little social justification if it does not replace these
traits with intelligent discemment and the judicial temper,"
he stated.

While we do not believe that the university gradu-
ate of the Middle West is as immature as is suggested by
Dr. Angeli there is still sufficient evidence that the Stu.
dent had better wake up and find out “what it's all
about" if he expects to advance in the business world.

WHERE CREDIT’S DUE

(The Michigan Daily)

Hardy pioneers of yesterday braved flood and fam—‘

inc, lndians and wild beasts, willing even to die (with

their boots on, of course) that the American frontiers

might be pushed back. Their story has been told and
retold. We know it well.

But for another spirived type of individual, the
student working his way through college, no paeans
are composed. Even through the added difficulties of
depression, he must continue unsung by those who
write movie scenarios and newspaper headlines.

That enrollment figures of colleges throughout the
Country have shown a marked increase this year, how.
ever, is heartening to all who believe in higher educa—
tion. Far from forgotten during less prosperous years,
colleges and universities are now in the midst of a
comeback that has surprised every one—educators as
much as anyone else.

Most of the newcomers that go to make’ up the in.
crease in attendance are working for their schooling and
perhaps undergoing other hardships as well. Today
an education, certainly, is one thing young men and
women will fight for. As long as this spirit prevails,
no one need worry about the future of learning. It:
is emerging from the testing period stronger than be—
fore.

Race Prejudice
Topic of Chapel
Speaker’s Talk

“Race prejudice in the north and
south is a difference of degree, ,
of kind.“ declared President Buell
Gallagher of Tallsdega college.
Talladega, Ala. in speaking at
the Chapel exercises on Thursday The
prejudice against the negroes is more
marked in the south because there
are more negroes in the southern
states, he declared.
The speaker explained and illus
traced the way in which the Ameri—
can people had cast oif the bonds of
slavery from the black people. He
declared that there wcie further bonds
of fear, ignorance, race pride and sel—
fishness which were constraining the
hearts and minds of the people.
Only by enlightened and sincere
devotion to Christian principles can
the barriers of racial hatred be torn
down and social justice be completed
in America, concluded the speaker.
President Gallagher also spoke in
the applied Christianity class immed.
iately following chapel. He there en.
larged upon his subject and told the
class about his college, which is a
negro institution.

Grinnell, lowa

Dear Jack:

NOTICE

October 27

 

You undobutedly remember the advertisement that we
ran in the Scarlet and Black prior to the homecoming game
announcing “Large’s Blanket Party."

We would like to let you know that we had 238 people
in the store who registered for this event. We must
say that some of this was due to our salesmen, but the
good copy and originality 'of the advertisement are surely
responsible for some of the remarkable results that we
had on this merchandising event. ,

We believe in the Scarlet and Black, and feel that prop.
erly inserted advertising will bring excellent returns.

Sincerely yours,

Joe Large

SCARLET and BLACK ADVERTISING

G ETS RESULTS

Because 'of the indifference that students are inclined
to have toward advertising, and beca se some of the actual
results of Scarlet and Black advert ng are not disernable
immediately, there has been a tendency among merchants to
believe that advertising in the school publications is merely

money thrown away.

Aside from the good will that is created, an advertise
ment that has good copy, ample space, and suitable position,

is bound to get results.

We believe in the abilities of the Scarlet and Black to

produce results. Give it a trial!

Large‘s Pharmacy did, ind

nearly one-third of the student body responded.
