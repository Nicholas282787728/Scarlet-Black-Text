III lENﬂ IHIIIIN TEAM

Morgan Taylor, Broolcins’ Rival,
Is Captain of the 1924-25
Cinder-Path Squad.

Y

At a recent meeting of the Honor G
track men, Morgan Taylor oi Sioux
City was elected to lead the 1915 cin-
der squad. Taylor has been one of
the main stays of the Maltese cross
for the past two years and the honor
of captaincy comes as a fitting re-
ward.

Next year will be the last ior the
Pioneer captain and it should be his
best Grinnell iana are already
making plans ior another big track
year with Taylor leading what is ex-
pected to be one oi the best teams in
Pioneer history. With a wll balanced
squad and a captain who is almost
certain at winning both hurdles in
any meet in the country, prospects
look unusually bright.

Under the coaching oi "Doe" Huil,
Morgan Taylor has developed into one
at the best hurdiers in the United
states. Last year he rounded into
shape rather late but he closed the
season by capturing u. iirst in the
highs and a second in the lows at the
Missouri Valley meet; then, a week
later he gave Brookins the race oi his
lite at the Nr'itional intercollegiate at
Chicago.

This year he was iorced to take sec-
ond in both sticks at the state meet be-
cause oi Brooklns and Crawford, but
in the valley meet he easily won both
hurdle races.

Not content with two events Taylor
Ihas also been anchor man on both
relays and has high jumped in some
meets. In the valley meet it was
his runuuing that clinched second and
almost gave Grinnell first in the two
relays, In the dual with Drake be
tied for first in the high jump with a
leap oi 5 iect, 9 inches.

In addition to his truck work he is
a member oi the Glee Club and was
recently elected to represent that or1
‘ganization 1n the Lantern.

left. yesterday for Indinnola to play it
return match with the Simpson net
men. From lndianola theywill go

The Pioneer team, strengthened by
the addition or John Stotts, should
have no difficulty in downingy the
Methodists. Gi‘innell won Over Simp-
Son, five matches to one, in their first
meeting of the year 50 it will take
quite a. leversal of form to enallle
the Methodists to come on out the
long end oi the/score.

The Pioneers and the Bulldogs have
not clashed on the courts this spring,
but in a meet nl. Homecoming tllne

S. & B. Dopes Winners

Four Pioneers will uphold Grinnell's
record in track and iield events in the
pre-Olympic twouts‘ at lowa City, to-
day. Over two hundred athletes irom
lowa, Minnesota, Wyoming, and North
and South Dakota will compete, and
the winners oi the iirst three places
will be eligible to compete in the ii.
nal tryouts at Boston in June.

The men whom “Doe" Pluti has en~
tered are: Taylor, Captain»eleet oi
next Year's squad, and hurdler extra-
ordinary, Rinefort, noettgcr, and Meet-
er, ireshman weight men. or these
iour,’ Taylor is the only one who will
wear. the Maltese cross, and the oth-
ers will compete unclassified, as
ireshmen are ineligible to run under
their college colors.

Taylor In nurtlles

Taylor is entered in the 110 meter
high hurdles, and the 400 meter spec.
ial hurdles. ’l‘here is‘no low hurdle
event in the Olympics, but the Pio<
neer star demonstrated his ability as
a. high hurdler by winnlug that event
at lowa City, despite the tact that he
will compete against such stars as
Towier oi Minnesota, and Crawiord oi
Iowa. The longer rac’c will be a new
one ior Taylor, but he is capable at
running a. very fast. 440, and if he mas.
ters the art of getting over the special
three-toot hurdles, in good term, he '
should place well up in the iinals

Rinelnrt is one oi the best discus
throwers in the state now, and last
year hung up tour high school
records, including the state record.
and the Gl'innell lnterscholastic rec-
ord. He has been “lurking out with
the platter all season, but hiss been
sawing his arm most of the time, so
as to be in shape for the meet today.
His best throw this se son was an
exhibition heave at the Quadrangular
high school meet at Marshalltow-n last
Week ,wheu be tossed it over 139 feet.
in addition to his discus throwing, the
prep track captain has been putting
the shot consistently- over torty ieet,
and he won the Drake—Grinnell fresh-
man telegraphic dual with a heave oi
-ll feet, 7 172 inches.

Boettger and Meeter are both shot-
putters oi iirst class ability; both
have held the state prep record with
the Ieround ball, and the latter holds
the state hl’gll school record. Boett-
scr has been making the best marks
in practice this spring, and his best.
throw is tlie_olie that broke the Home
uicet record, iorty-two [eet even.

Paulo To nun

Another point of interest [0 Grin-
rieii ions is that Leonard T, Paulu,
ior-mcr Pioneer sprinter will compete
in the 100 and 220 meter dashes. Pau-
iu has been working out all season and
has proven that he is still one of the
monster dash meii oi the country. At
the Grinnell Interscholastic he ran
the century in :09.9 against handicap-
ped competition, and liist Saturday at
the Quadrangular meet be negotiated
the distance In :09]. He appears to
be in iirst class shape, and has im-
moved his start over that which he
ind in college, so it will take an ex-

 

ceedingly last man to beat him.
