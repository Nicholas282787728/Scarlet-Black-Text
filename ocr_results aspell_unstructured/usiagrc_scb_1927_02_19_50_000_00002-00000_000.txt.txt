As any archaeologist will tell you, relics have their
placeiiu the museum.

But little premium will he paid until a thousand
years hence for 1927 relics. Consequently it behooves
the seniors or the class of 1927 to establish for themselves
a gut which will have permanent value in some other
place than a 3047 American museum.

. Talk with the building and grounds committees of
Grlnnell college and you will find that beneath the turf
of the campus is hurled the relics or many a previous
class gilt, For example, it was once thought by the

ideal place to teach the 5mm; idea how to slitiiit.

De MilIe Prefers .
Brunettes Rather
Than Blond Types

In response to a recent wire Cecil
B. dc )lille said, “ I preter brunettcstti
hlondes.” This statement was quite
otit oi the ordinary and to say the
least not a little startling. The difl‘ir
only was cleared by the letter which
followed the wire.

here is no question of prererenvc
in the coincidence that over a period
or years the majority or my leading
women have been hriineites. it has
so happened that the majority ol the
parts seemed to indicate brunettes,”
wrote M . de hillle.

As it prophesying the downtall of
lilonde supremacy the letter contin-
lies, it so happens that a trend of lit-
erature is giving particular dramatic
importance to the brunette races. We
are coming to the era or dark, inter-
esting, ioreigii types, Here we have ii
great reason for the growing eclipse
of the blonde."

As it tor a word of caution to the
brunettes, de lilllle adds. "We are be—
yond the ‘type’ stage in pictures and
I hope we never return to it. To pick
hy types means to indicate that a
hlonde lacks something which a iii-ii-
nette possesses, which is never true.
