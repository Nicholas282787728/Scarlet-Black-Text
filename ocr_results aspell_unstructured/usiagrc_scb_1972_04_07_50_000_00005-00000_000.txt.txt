The Venture Club is a Grinnell

VISTA volunteer in Gi'innell, but
the response and active participas

This ycitl', however, the focus in
selection has changed, allowing
more school cliilliien the opportune

when the program was first or-
ganized, only those who were eco»

With the revival some changes in
the selection, l\hich opened it to

Is A Success

ment, The results of this year's
progress may encourage more pairs
licipants irom both sides, Wes ruyii
noted,

The only group activity last year
was a party at Lake Nyanza, which
reportedly was not too well attended.
Three major parties have been plane
ned and two already carried out [or
this semester.

In February, there was a Vote
entine's party with an aiternoon oi
movies and cartoons in ARH Rom
ireshnlents were served following
the movies April 1 iouiid kids-- 'g
and lll|le~~sctlrrylng all over cenr
tral campus hunting Easter eggs
which had been colored at an egg
coloring party by the Student Rec»
reution Committee the night before.

The party continued at the P.E
complex, where the pool was open for
swimmers, and other indool‘ activis
ties were set up tor those preierring
not to swim.

A picnic is being planned, but the
details are not explicit yet.

When there are not allsgroup par-
ties to attend most students see their
little brothers and sisters an aver-
age of once a week. Often something
so simple as a walk or an imaginary
tea party in one’s room is enough to
occupy an aiternoon, Wittithe advent
oi spring, activities will include
more outside adventures.

Considering the success of the pro-
gram this year, it is hoped that the
interest level will he maintained in
the future

Writers Reveal Talents

by Marty iker

The Writer's Centerence reached
a climactic end at 9 o’clock Tuesday
night with the announcement oi the
annual poetry and tiction contest

was the summit oi the two day con
ference, highlighted by two poetry
readings by visiting poet Donald Hall
and a tea ior Mr, Hall attended by
English majors .

Last week, immediately alter break
ended, contest entries began to
trickle in By the end of the week,
the English Department was literally
inundated with material, receiving in
all 175 poems and i8 pieces of ties
tion Contributors were allowed to
submit up to five poems and two tic.
tional pieces Awards were based on
the enli'ant’s total submission rather
then on individual stories or poems,

Contestants ranged trom veteran
writers to iledglings. Many enr
trants, who had never written anyr
thing bciore. submitted material to
the contest because the author's
identity remained secret (each con~
tributor was assigned a number and
omitted his name irom the manur
script) and the rewards wcreattrad

well attended.

The first night, Mr. Hall read a
number of his own poems,beginning
with his early works and progressing
through various stages until he
reached a number of proserpoems
which are Still in the final revision
process. Mr. Hall revises his poems
extensively; he cites one poem on
which he has been working for over
four years.

iiis second reading consisted oi
his iavorite poems written by other
poets of roughly his own age, in»
cluding Richard Wilbur, Robert Ely,
Allen Ginzberg, and Louis Simpson.
Between the recitations were anums
ber oi interesting anecdotes about
the poets and poems. His words
were filled with admiration for his
iellbw poets.

Tea and Poetry

The tea, (or many English mayors,
was the best part of the conference.
Held in Grinnell House on Tuesday
afternoon, the informal meeting gave
the majors a chance to meet Mr.
Hall, get wellsacquainted with him
and discuss diiierent aspects oi the
iield oi poetry with an expert.

The discussion began with general
questions on the subject or where a
poem comes from, "All poems start
originally irom inspiration, Then
craft takes over, You have a Solid
block from which to carve your
sculpture.” He moved on to the
sublect matter or expression oi a
poem...“We don’t know What We‘re
creating...We’l‘e dreaming all the
time we're awake...The ostensible
subject matter isn’t really what. the
poem is doing" and to what poetry
ls.,,“Foetry iS the part between the
poem and thel paraphrase, What’s
left when you get to the heart of the
matter," He also discussed the
merits of free and formal verse, he

‘ has written both,

Throughout the tea, Mr. Hall em-
phasized the need for writers to
work closely with each other in
"perfecting” the quality or each
others work and the necessity for
a poet “to realize that the poem is
more important than he is, although
fame is nice...to enable this co-
operation to occur and succeed.”
All in all, the conference was very
cnioyable ior- all involved and pro-
video a long-overdue opportunity for
the litany writers lurking deep in the
caverns of Gritinell College to come
Out and discover the light (and each
other) once again

This opportunity was most wel»
come, but more activities are needed
which would have a similar effect
and possibly bring Grinnell writers
into n iunetibning community such
as Mr, Hall stressed so emphaV
ttcally

The Scarlet and Black
The Doppelt Effect

April 7, 1972'

Hiser Recalls 36 Years

by Jack Doppelt

College will be just a little less
stimulating next year. A school cans
not endure the retirement of two
professors of the caliber oia Velma
Hiser and a Grant 0. Gale without
a bit of enthusiasm and character
being spilled

Grinnell and the Communications
Department encountered a lucky
break in 1937 when Velma Hiser
decided to return as a teacher to
the school where she had spent two
years as a student.

Mrs. Hiser, the daughter oi a
iormer iowa senator, has practical
experience in speech, drama (turned
down a chance to act on stage pro-
fessionally), communications, pol-
itics, and dog training. Although
these Credentials can hardly be
overlooked, but easily oversimpli-
tied, she ieels her greatest asset
to the College might have been her
five»year experience as a teacher
before Coming here.

”The trouble with a lot of college
teachers is that they have not had
enough experience teaching,“ said
the Communications professor.
“Some fail to challenge their Stu~
dents because they are more ins
terested in pursuing their own edur
cation that furthering their students'
(education) when they come directly
after receiving their PhD'S.’Y

Mrs. Hiser has never been one to
lean back and take her potential as
a concerned teacher leisurely. When
she arrived in 1937, she organized
and developed our first speech
clinic, The Clinic does not only
concentrate on college students, but
also iurnishes programs to nearby
public schools This program not
only helps young people with their
speech problems, but afford Grin-
heli speech majors the opportunity
to put some of their theory into
worthwhile practice

”A good pathologist should start
in the undergraduate level to de-
velap as clinicians,” she advised,
"We provide a clinical practicum
because at a need for some form of
practical application.”

Mrs. Hiser believes that Grinnell
could oiier more practical experi-
ence in most departments.

“For instance, very few people
really understand how government
functions," commented Mrs. Hiser,
a former assistant to an Iowa Gov,
ernor.

VELMA HISER

As a veteran of Grinnell College
tor 35 years (~35, this tall!” she
added proudly), Mrs Hiser has no-
ticed the school change and progress
socially

“I enjoy today’s students more than
any beiore, except the veterans com»
ing back after the war Today's stu-
dents are alert mentally; they ques-
tion and keep you on your toes,” she
Said.

The Northwestern graduate comm
mends the progressive social
atmosphere on campus.

“I wondered about coed dorms for
awhile but i approve now. it is a
wholesome relationship. The slum

leMoyne-Ovven Student
Finds Grinnell Different

by Steve uumi

Mamie Williams, a sophomore eco-

nomics mayor at LeMoynerOwen
College in Memphis, came up to
Grinnell because she wanted “a
change in scenery v and what bet
ter change could there be than
Grinnell?"

it was deiinitely a change. LeMoyne
is a city liberal arts college, prer
dominantly black, and the two places
are, she notes, ”completely dil-
terent environments." At first this
required some adjustments on her
part, but now her impressions seem
generally iavorable. She approves
of the academic atmosphere here for
one thing. And while she has found
Grinneil blacks “not that much difs
ferent” irom those at LeMbyne,
she has gotten some different ideas
about whites,

Mamie is impressed by the iamous
Grinnell ﬂexibility. LeMoyne’s sys-
tem is more traditional and includes
a numberoiaeademic requirements.
However, Mamie, a member oiAlpha
Kappa Alpha sorority, prefers the
greater social organization at Le
Moyne.

Classes at LeMoyne are mostly
lectures, and surprisingly she has
found the student discussion and
class participation here a change,
She also comments on the informalr
ity of dress she finds at Grinnell,

With regard to the question or
colors, Mamie is cautiously pleased
with Grinneli~~the college, that is.
Memphis, she points out, is in the

deep south and is something oi a

prejudiced town. But at Grinnell, she

says, in most places she “can’t see
that much open prejudice, yet," And
downtown “the people are all
smiles.”

But she adds, “I rim not ready to
conclude anything...I’m trying to de»
Cide whether the smiles are just
fronts.”

Although she thinks she has always
been less prejudiced than a lot of
people, Mamie admits that some oi
her own attitudes about Whites have
changed since she has been here.
“You can’t go by what you hear,”
she says, explaining that she has
made several white friends here and
has become ”quite attached” to
some of them.

After noting the success of Ii Le
Moync experiment similar to the
Black Library that has been pro-
posed for Burling, Mamie added that
“there is not that much difference
(between black students at LeMoyne
and those here) in attitudes , but at
Grinnell the political attitudes are
more open, because they are trying
to reach certain goals on a white
Campus,"

Grinneil has hail its student
exchange program with LeMoyne for
a number of years Mnmie’s ac,
quaintance with several participants
in the program, irbm both LcMoyne
and Grinnell, was an important face
tor in her decision to come, Cur-
rently she is the only LeMOyne Stun
dent here, another had been slated
to come this semester but decided
against it.

One Grinnell student, Shirley John»

 

son, is at LeMoyne for a semester

dents are accepting one another as
persons, as individuals," she ob-
served.

She recalled a problem which she
feels has been alleviated.

“Students seem happier socially.
There always used to be a dating
problem; girls wanted to date but
the boys weren’t very interested”

Mrs, Hiser, married for over 30
years, was concerned about the
progress of women on campus.

"There has only been a gradual
improvement on campus tor women
iaeulty. The number of women iae-
ulty has actually decreased sincei
came.” She mentioned over ten
women in diversified departments}

“Most haven’t been paid equal Sal»
arias to men, and in general they
have been excluded from Commits
lees. Only during the war did women
serve predominantly and they did a
good yon.”

Mrs. Hiser mentioned that even
as a full professor, she is still not
paid an equal salary, She added that
only this year, since women iaeulty
have put pressure on the administms
tion, have Efforts been made.

The speech therapist pointed out
another malady ofpresentrday Grinr
nell,

“Grinnell used to he a good place
ior young, single iaeulty members.
The tendency of singles to come has
diminished, particularly single wo-
men," she said
Mrs, Hiser mentioned the existence
or a iaeulty commons where singles
could eat two daily meals, play pool,
and converse. This helped to make
the iacnlty a closer unit. However,
the married faculty members com-
plained about the disproportionate
expenses [or such a commons and
it was discontinued.

Besides her active interest in the
college, Mrs. Hiser raises dogs and
operates a renowned kennel. At one
time her kennel housed over 35
dogs, mostly boxers. Now she cares
for five boxers and three schnauz~
ers.
