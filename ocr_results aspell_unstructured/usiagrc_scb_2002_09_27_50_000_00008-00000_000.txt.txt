Book Trader/Tan America
105 1st St. N.

Iryou were ever disappointed that there was no
place to buy used books and tan, then Newton is

“Church Row”

N. 2nd Ave.
Small town worship scene got you down? Starting

the answer to your prayers. The used book collec»
lien is surprisingly extensive and the tanning beds
in the back make you think you are in some modern
metropolis. Really, they do.

on the corner of 2nd Ave. and E. 3rd St. and
extending two blocks is "church row.” It has four
really big Protestant churches—big enough to
satisfy any Christian worship needs... as long as
you're not Catholic. Make sure you stop by the
Methodist Episcopal Church, home to the one and
only ”Whirlwind Jesus."

Salvation Army Thrift Store I

114 E. 3rd St. N
If the Grinnell thrift store experience isn’t quite
enough for you, this one will satisfy all your
second hand needs. It's big and has ”departments.”
If you need a variety of [heap stuff, this store is a
good place to try your luck. In other words, its
worth the drive.

Skate Castle

1611 1st Ave. W
If you have a hot date and he or she is 12, then you
are sick, but Newton does have the perfect place for
you to take him or her. Skate Castle is the most
interesting building in the tri—county area, and you
can skate around its pretty decent rink for fair
amounts. An afternoon would probably cost about
58 a person, and that includes snacks. If you’re
nostalgic for middle school skate nights, Skate

castle should pacify you.

Advertising itself as having the ”best tires in Iowa,"
it may be worth the trip. If you don’t have a car:
not as exciting.

1501 1st Ave. W.
Whether it’s an attack of the freshman 40 or you’d
just like to tease Iowa’s larger women, a stop by
Leanne’s is in order. This is classic middle America,
folks. You can go use the shop for a case study in

ignore my advice and dine at Gaucho’s, make sure you

Valle Drive-In Theater

4074 Hwy. F48
The drive~in theater tmdition still lives on in
Newton at the only drive-in left in Central Iowa. The
Valle Drive~In opens for business in May every year
and stays open through mid-October. The driveq'n is
open every day of the week, with the ﬁrst show at
8:15 pm. Call 792-3558 for show information.

Wrestling Institute and Museum

1690 W. 19th St. S.
This is the only real museum in Newton. It is on the
outskirts of town, and since "outskirts” entails all of
Newton except tour square blocks in the center. we
couldn’t ﬁnd it. If you are dying to see it. most
anyone in town can point you in the right direction,
but you can get your fill or men in spandex elsewhere.

want to chain smoke and try.

Gaucho Café

207 1st Ave. E.
The Sign advertises delicious Argentinian cuisine.
However, the main Argentinian dishes were unavaile
able at the time of our trip. There were a good deal
of Italian dishes on the menu, and Argentinian
appetizers were available. The empanaoas were a
little doughy and heavy on trust, out not filling.
The vegetarian options were limited, and vegans are
out of luck. The waitress was cheerful but forgetful
and overworked. The food was only lukewarm and
did not appear freshly prepared. At about $10 a
plate, maybe you should just go to La Cabana,
