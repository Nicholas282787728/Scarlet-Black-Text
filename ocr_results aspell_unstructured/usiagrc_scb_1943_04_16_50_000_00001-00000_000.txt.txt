Balbara Brann, Hames junior, has elected editol of the
Scallet and Black for 1943- 44 Wednesday afternoon by the
publications board, John Pooley, faculty atlyisor for the

gr oup, announced yesterday.

Action on the election of a bus-
iness manager for the publication
for next year was delayed until
the May meeting, when no appli-
cations were received for that
position, Pooley added.

He stressed that the job pays
the equivalent of the highest cole
lege job this year of $140 each
semester.

Any student reasonably sure
of returning to college next year
is eligible for the position. he
said. Some experience in hand-
ling bookkeeping is valuable, he
added

The two leading positions of the
Scarlet and Block staff have been
financed by the college since last
spring. other editorial and busls
ncss positions are appointive. and
Miss Brann announced that she
would choose her assistant editor
sometime this spring.

Assistantships on both staffs
are considered llalf~time jobs by
the college, and paid $70 a semes-
tcr this year.

Applications for the position of
business manager should be ad-

dressed to Pooley and must be
received by him by May 10,
