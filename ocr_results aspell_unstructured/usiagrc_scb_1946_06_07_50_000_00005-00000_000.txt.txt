'Blilhe Spiri’r' Returns:

Players Acting Award

Blithe was the Spirit that
haunted the new theater in

evening and will make it re—

The, to coin a cliche, “out ofi
this world” atmosphere of the
Noel Coward farce was well pre-
served under the handicap of 111*
complete lighting equipment and
illness among the cast in
preview performance. From this
stage hand's eye point of view,
it promises to offer a profession-
al evenings entertainment.

The Grinnell Players annual
best acting award for this year
'.was presented, during the inter-
mission at the first performance,
to Barbara Macoubrey, who plays
Ruth, one of the two feminine
leads in this production. It was
awarded for her portrayal of
Milly, the slightly mad sister in
The Lady Who came to Stay,

The farce, directed by Kent
Andrews, is a revival of last
year's presentation, and is re-
placing the scheduled centennial
play, which has been postponed
until fall.

The cast contains one of
