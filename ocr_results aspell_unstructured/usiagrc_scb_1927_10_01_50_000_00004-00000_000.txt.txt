With the exception of tennis and
bicycling, the outdoor activities of the
physical education department have
been progressing regularly during the
past week. In spite of the rain, the

there will be horseback riding is still
uncertain; however. the question will
be settled within the next few days.

According to Miss Clara 1. Ander-
son. the dancing cla’sses are making
excellent progress. It is hoped that
a ballet may be staged this winter. Be-
cause of the weather, a hike and plan
nic supper for those girls taking the

changed to a class in folk dancing.

This year it will he possible for
treshmen to take two hours or swim-
ming a week for one semester, pro-
vided they are willing to take two
hours of physical education a week
the tollowing semester. Upper class-
men will be permitted to take a whole
year ct swimming, but must follow it
the next year with two semesters or
physical education. It is hoped that
this additional concentration will tend
toward greater eiticiency in (he activi-
ties.

the w. A. A, girls are members ot the

EVERY pipe is 3 Sunny jimmy-
pipc when it’s packed with P. A.
The tidy red tin chases the blues
———and how! Why, you feel bet-
ter the instant you open the' tin
and get that marvelous P. A.
Every chore becomes a
cheer, and you’re sitting on top
of the world.

Then you load up and light up.
That taste—that never-to-be-for-
gotten, can’t- get-too-much-of -it
taste! Cool as a cut-in from the
stag-line. Sweet as retaliation.
Mild and mellow and long-bum-
ing, with a balanced body that
