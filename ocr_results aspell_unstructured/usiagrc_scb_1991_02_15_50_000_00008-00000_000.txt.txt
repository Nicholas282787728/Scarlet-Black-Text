New Duncan Imperials to make their
long— awaited Harris Center debut

By David Shearer

The New Duncan Impenals are
coming to Grinnell tonight.

When I learned the above fact,l
reachedaplateauofexcitemcntthat
almostmademcconsidergtvingup
Jlmbos for Passover. Why, you
ask, would the mere thought of
having thtsbandnctuallyplayagig
zit the Harris Center cause me to
forsakemyreligiousbeliefs? Well,
it’s a long story“.

I have been an Imperials fan for
what seems like all my life. I’ve
always carried with me the image
ofa“perfectband” in my head, but
it was fonnless until about a year
ago, when my dream band played a
show in good ‘ole Carder. I knew
from the minutel was handeda Ho-
Ho that this band was for me. The
thought of getting hit maybe just
once by a piece of animal cracker
from the lead singer‘s mouth her
camelrulyenoughlogetmcthrough
life.

Butevenadreambandcanhave
its faults. Sure they give outlets of
treat free stuff, but, for me, there‘s
something a little wrong. Being a
“born-again onhadox evangelical
hope-for-tommorrow Lutheran
monk," I sometimes find myself
disagreeing with their message.

The New Duncan Imperials hard at play.

Their parly»all~lhe~lime attitude
seems a little immature to me and
tends to be at odds with what my
parents always told me was right.

Now, sure, I guess a weekend of
goln’ nuts is alrighionce in awhile,
but I just worry that the band’s
appearance here at Grinnell could
have an adverse affect on studying.
I mean, once you start down the
slipperyslope. it‘shard to stop, you
know?

But who‘s perfect? I. for one.

my little heart away, knowing that
at any minute I could go into car»

Poets discuss duality

By John Post

The black American, wrote
W.E.B. Dubois, is “than Ameri-
can, a Negro: two souls. two
thoughts, two unreconciled
strivings; two warringidealsinone
dark body, whose dogged strength
alone keeps it from being torn
asunder.”

This strong double agenda of
black writers during periods ofwai‘,
Li“double flame" lighting hopes for
Lt patriotic struggle, was the topic
addressed by Professor Maria
Mootry in her recent Convocation
entitled “Poet on Fire."

Through several poetry read-
ings, Mootry, Associate Professor
ofEnglish,discusscdtheconﬂictof
identity and conscience that has
plagued AfrorAmerieans Ihrough-
out thisU.S. history,

Mootry began the convoca-
lion with a poem written by Phillis
Wheatley during the the American
Revolution. Brought from Africa
as a child and sold into slavery,
Wheatley began writing poetry at
age 13. Her poem to the Earl of
Dartmouth expressed her love of
freedom over all. Though she had
been “snatched" from Africa, she
praised the revolution as a fight for
God and liberty.

Mootry then read “When
They Enlisted the Colored Sol-
diers," written by Paul Lawrence
Dunbar, a former slave who was
confronted with a similar dual pa-
triotism after the Civil War. Told
from the perspective of a black
housewife whose son has lefthome
to ﬁght, his poem conveys the dif-

ficult position of blacks in society
and their heroism in weir.

Addressing the first and see
ond World Wars, Mootry read
works by Claude McKay, which
raised topics such as the conﬂict
between President Wilson's fight
for freedom abroad and his support
of segregation in the Untied States.

Mootry also read Gwendolyn
Brooks‘ “Negro Hero,“ the story of
thc youngblack named Dory Miller
who. acting against rules of segre-
gation during World War II, fought
on the U.S.S. Arizona and person-
ally gunned down four Japanese
planes before he died in the South
Paciﬁc.

The disproportionately large
number of blacks serving in the
Vietnam War coupled With the
abuse of blacks in the Us. lead yet
anotherpoet, l-laki MadhubutitDon
L. Lee) to voice his concerns in his
poem “Communication in White,”
read by Mootry.

Lastly, Mootry addressed the
current war in the Middle East. In
her own poem, “The African
American Soldier Speaks,“ she re-
vealed the doubts going through
the heads of many black soldiers in
Saudi Arabia as they watch the
bombsexplodingindteoulr, While ‘
they fight for their country, pov-
erty. over-imprisonment, and rac-
ism plague black Americans here at
home, and our city streets are 31*
most as dangerous as the war zone.

Mootry explained that. once
again, here is the double strife be-
tween a reconciliation of concem
for the State and for the life ofihe
Negro.
