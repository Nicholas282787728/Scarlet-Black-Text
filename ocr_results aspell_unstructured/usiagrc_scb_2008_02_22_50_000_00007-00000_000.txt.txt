Grinnell-in-London and campus health

OCS mix-up needs fixing

For dozens ofstudents each year, Grins
nell's study abroad program in London
offered a relatively ccrrain gateway to
Europe, in an Engr
lishrspeaking counr
try with Grinnell
faculty and highly
regarded internships.
It was the center
piece or Grinnell's
off—campus study
program, and some-
thing to brag about.

But this year, an untxpccted rush of
applicants led to dozens of students be-
ing shut out of this previously “safe" op-
tion, Others were accepted but denied the
chance to do internships, Perhaps worse,
faced with hard choices about which stu»
dents to accept,Off-Campus Study (OCS)
relied initially on a single, insufﬁcient fac—

tor: GPA.

Even though OCS has actetl commend-
ably in trying to place rejected students iir
other programs, we feel that the problems
exposed in this incident highlight the need
for OCS to revisit how
it handles its London
and Washington pros
grams, as called for
by a recent successful
student initiative.

The most obvir
ous change needed is
more accurate adver—
tising for offrcamprrs programs. Many stu—
dents who applied for Grinnell—in—London
said that they had gotten the impression that
all qu rriified students were all but guaranteed
to be accepted for the program, and that
news of their denial crime as a shock.

We understand that this was the first time
in decades that the program had faced this
problem, but ocs should deﬁnitely learn

stir

di

from this situation: keep future students
better informed about their prospccts, and
trike steps to anticipate overloads and shift
excess students into other programs before
a crisis develops,

Mon: troubling is the use of GPA to
determine which students got admitted
to the program. ocs has long rc’quircd
minimum GPAs for students to apply,
and we would not go so far as to suggest
thdt grades are not a valid factor to con-
sider. But they certainly should not be
the principal factor, particularly not for
secondvyeats with only three semesters
ofgrades under their belts. There is more
to college than grades, and students with
the best marks may not necessarily be the
best equipped to handle a semester abroad.
OCS should look at students' entire appli—
cations in making decisions.

We hope that OCS takes this situation
seriously and mites major steps to prevent

It's big, it's beautiful, and parts of it are
sprawling. No, this is not a strategically placed

icar And what do I think about our nation?
I love it. That's right; I said love, and I don’t
have to deny our imperfections to do so.

So what's the dillio (just thought I’d try to
bring that one back)? Am I not just wasting
this column by praising our water-boarding,
Middle East—invading homeland? Before you
lribcl me as uninformed ot refer me to one of
your favorite, chop-busting blogs,jusr hear me
out.

I understand that one oftlre most basic tee
nets of democracy is the right to criticize the
government. I've certainly done more of my
fair share of ﬁSX’Sl'lﬂklng at Uncle Sam. How
else can a people hold their leaders accounr-
able? But sometimes we in academia go a bit
too far. sometimes we turn from insightful to
just plain annoying.

Go ahead, try to find ways to improve
an inevitably imperfect Airicrican society by
pointing out its lliws, Yes, our country has
done some pretty lousy things: the Native

internmcnrs, just to name a row We obvious»

comes to human rights and inequality. Have
you evct taken a stroll through Detroit>

But don’t lost: sight of our nation's overt
whclrningly positive attributes, Take a look
around and think about how things would be
different had you grown up somewhere else.
I'm not sure about you, bur l’m quire glad that
we have the right to speak, write, assemble, pe—
tition, and practice our religious freely. While
we often take these rights for granted, us im-
portant to remember that they don't show up

in a huge numberorplaces around the globe. I
would never objcct to any academic work that
sheds negative light on our nation. Brit otrthe
cuttiicgnriviry and US» related pessimism sets
ottiny nonrpr'ngmntic alarm.

Case in point: A discussion in my Chincsc
Politics class. Towards the end of class, cone
versarion turned to China's continued human
rights abuses and the difficulties that other
countries face in trying to force the PRC to
further clean up
its act. Logical-
ly, the US came
into the discuss
sion,

And then
it hdppcncd, a
comment was
made which would have made Abraham Lil‘l’
coin and Mao Zedong roll over in their re-
specrivc graves (Abe from outrage, hut Mao
because he was laughing). someone suggested
that when it comes [0 addrtssing the egregious
human rights violations ota repressive govcrnr
incur, “the U S. has no room to tillk,"citing a
few recent liorrbutton issues.

Like, rcnlly? Our record is no better than
China’s? sure, China has certainly improvcd
over the past half century oi so, but it is still it

and cultural genocide (llint: Tibet is still far

of this notion? While I'm quirc ccr'rii'in thdt
