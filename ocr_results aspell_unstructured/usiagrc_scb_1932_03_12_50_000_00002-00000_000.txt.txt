‘ WANT ' .

A professor stated recently that revolutions
tilwdy. appear ill warm Weather. A chill willd or
a wet rain, he uoluiilonted cynically, has n lulu-vol-
on. y dampening effect on the human passion for
libel y, oqudlitv and fraternity. ,

Yet it few thousand men in Detroit lldrntlril at
near-zero temperatures and neither fire-hose nor
tear gas bombs were able to stop them. Apparently
ilwre was something more than ordinary dissatis-
faction there. Probably it was want.

.~\t the stunt: time many Gi-innell students til‘l‘
being informed that their jobs in ill danger il‘
their work does not justify the continuance of :titl
to them. There are more and better applicants for
entrance to college next year than ever, lint. \lll‘l'e
is all accompanying increase in demands for aid.

The relation between rioting uucmplovcd Illt‘ll
in Detroit and students threatened with lo ' jobs
is not distant; it is very near. ll. lies in tho i: t
that the whole world is faced with want.

VVzint has far flung consequences. lt llthlllS
that college students who want jobs inn have not
merely spent four years in rm educational institu-
tion, but must have cvitlcnccd cxtl'dortlin: -_\‘ appli-
cation and diligence. It means that. t'OHlpOllllOll
will be sharper for the opportunities \l'lll('l\ arc
dwindling in number. It means the morgue ire
elimination from college and from busin :lliliiV ill
the individuals who do not lllaire rt posl we and
valuable contribution to their institution.

SHELTERING THE COLLEGE BOY
(From the Daily nlini)

College boys have been regarded as men or at least
young men at many institutions up to their time, but
Grinnell college seems to hold different ideas on the
subject. The Chicago Tribune subscription to the Grins
nell library was recently cancelled by college officials
when it was felt that the students were under an evil
influence when reading it.

In putting the Tribune on the expurgated list, Gim-
nell officials approach a censorship that is only rivaled
by that of John Calvin and the Catholic popes. When
the college men of today have to be shielded from the
evil influences of the world to the extent of dictating
what they read, the time has come for a change.

Jazz music for campus functions has been abolished
at Barnard college in New York for the same reasons
that Grinnell puts forth in forcefully protecting its stal-
wart sons from the orgy of human drama. The only
reason that even comes near justifying such moves is
the fact that churches control these colleges. In our
mind it is much better to take advantage of the evil
contacts along with the good while in college. Consider
both and retain or discard either on its merits or lack
of value. This seems more in keeping with the prog’res»
sive spirit of college education rather than preeparing
men to live in the world by not allowing them contact
with it.

Why should we today close our eyes in horror and
timidly request Satan to take a rear scat, when tomor-
row we will have to come face to face withall his works
in everyday life?
