SAanDAY's DEFEitTat Iowa City
was not a pleasant sight tor Grin-
nell eyes, though the result was no
surprise. It was not so very long
ago that Iowa was taking football
lessons from Grinncll and receivr
ing more than her share of defeats,
But that day has passed. Iowa
has seized her opportunity and
come into the heritage that should
have been hers years ago. Not
Giinnell’s eniollnienr in-
creases can wc hope to provide
our university really hard contests
on the gridiron. But we can at
least merit a continuance of alli-
letit: relations and glaciously aclrr
nowlcdge the prestige of the great-
est eleven the Hawkeye state has
ever seen, For the ﬁrst time in its
history, SCARLET m: BLACK is
compelled to regret a Store made
by a Grinncll Learn. The safety
touchdown which, according to
the technical construction of the
rulesgave Grinncll its points, res
ﬂcctcd no credit on our team and
hence we sincerely regret that l6m~
porary carelessness on the part oi
onc gallant player allowed even so
slight a blot on Iowa’s splendid
record.

THE FRIENDLY feeling existing
between the State University and
Grinnell was plainly maniiested in
lastSatul‘day’sgame. Therooters
on both sides vied with each other
in giving their opponent's yells,
and the game itself was remark»
ably clean and tree from wrangling
and ill nature. It is Extl'emely‘
gratifying that the hatchet of the
old-time rivalry has been buried
and that the new rivalry is of such
a genuine sort. The treatment
accorded the visitors was unifornr
1y courteous, and Grinncll will alr
ways remember with pleasure the
genuine hospitality shown them
at Iowa City. '
