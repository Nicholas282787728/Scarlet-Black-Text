Scarlet and Black was published I re

ceived a message over the computer
from a man named Don Smith. The message
was a response to the last Face: and Place:
arliclewhichinquiredintosomeinitials,simi-
lar to mine, etched into the cement on south
campus and dated 1938. I had gone through
several yearbooks to figure outwhose initials
they were,choosingawoman namedBeatrice
Mills as my best Candidate. ML Smith ex-
plainedtomethatBeatn'ceMills(nowBeatrice
Wall, wife ofJoseph Wall) iseurrentty living
in Grinnell. The fact that the woman I had
chosentowriteaboutandidentifiedwithlived
in Grinnell was exciting.

Mrs. Wall and I met for lunch at the
Forum Grillr Although her hair now a shiny
gray, her cheery round face still shone just as
itdidin the yearbookimagesofherfrom 1938.
Talking with her came very naturally, and was
almostlikebeingwithanoldfriendiWetalked
for around an hour about Grinnell, her life
and my own

Before we met, Mrs, Wall told me over
the phone that although the name etched in the
sidewalk was not her own, she did know
whose it was, It turns out her roommate fresh»
man year, Barbara Louise Moss, and Ms.
Moss’s boyfriend Bob Berry were the ones
that wrote their names in the cement. Mrs,
Wall explained that Barbara transferred after
her freshman yem and was probably visiting
one weckrcnd when she wrote her name. Mrs.

FACES AND P

A Twist OfFate

Wall jokingly explained that the year the
initials were written she was living in Clever
land and probably never even made it down
the loggia as far as James, where the names
were etched.

Although Mrs. Wall lived in Boston for a
while after she graduated, and has traveled
through various parts of the world, much of
her life after college has been spent living in
Grinnell WiLll her husband, who is a professor
at the college, and raising three children. As a
result of her time spent here, she has seen the
evolution of the College from the 1940s until
now While talking to Mrs. Wall, the year
books I had searched through came alive with
real life stories and animation.

Mrs. Wall feels the biggest difference
between today and the time when she went to
school in Grinnell is that the campus is no
longer divided by sex nor is it governed by
strict rules. She explained that the women
usually only saw men at church, in class, or at
parties. There was only one meal during the
week in which both men and women could eat
together. Dating was a lot more rigid and
generally rather thanjust“seeing" someoneas
we do now, couples would go steady, which
Mrs. Wall explained caused dating to be a lot
moreexclusiveandinflexible.Mrs.Wallscems
tohavealotofrespeetforthefreedomsthatwe
are given today.

We talked for a while about the way the
dormitories were Set up in the late '305. She
explained that the men stayed in one dorm for
all four of their college years, which resulted
in a fraternity like atmosphere. The women
drew for rooms each year,just as we do now.

All ofthe dorms had house mothers, who Mrs.
Wall explained in her mind seemed mostly
like old women thatjust sat around.

I asked Mrs. Wall about alcohol on Cam-
pus when she went to school, She said there
were rules strictly prohibiting both drinking
and smoking, 5 he explained that she didn ’1 see
any problems with alcohol on campus, al-
though she jokingly admitted that she was
always a bit naive to those sort of things. (Her
brother claims thatshe didn‘thaveenough fun
in college because she can’t play bridge very
well.) She explained that Haines basement
loungewasthe only place women could smoke.
Although she didn’t go there, she said that
women would stay up late smokm g cigarettes
and playing bridge.

Despite the differences in social structure
andrules atGrinncll,she ieclsthatthestudents

an aim

have stayed very much the same over the
years; beingboth friendlyand fun tobearound.

In the lastFace: and Place: article] wrote.
“whether Beatrice and I would have had much
in Common aside from our initials, I'll probably
never knows” With a bit of fate, I’ve been able
to find that we do have a great deal in common
and in fact get a long quite well.

Both Mrs. Wall and I have an interest in
China and the Chinese languageand haveboth
studied Chinese at Grinnell. We spent a bit of
time talking about China: a place she just
recently travelled to, and a place I still dream
of going to.

My lunch with Mrs. Wall was very spe»
cial. The connections I felt with the past came
[0 life as we talked. Although two generations
separate _us, I felt very at home speaking with
her about her life and my own.
