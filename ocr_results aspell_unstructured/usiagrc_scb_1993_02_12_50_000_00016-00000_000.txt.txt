CONCERIS lrom page 1

semester’s headliningband,othcrs l'eltihe457minute
concert was not worth the $6000 ConcertsCommittoe
paid for it. They believethe money from ltistsemester
was poorly spent.

Concerts Committee members said they arcaware
of student criticism. “I know a lot of people weren’t
satisfied...wejust had a slow start," Miller said.

Committee members cited several constraining
factors which they feel made booking bands diﬂicult
last semester.

The shortage and Inﬂexibility of concert dates
was“thebiggestlimiting factor lastscmester,”Millcr
said.

“There are only so many weekend dates." said
All-Campus Events Coordinator Kendra Lesce. No
two events receiving student funding can occ urat the
same time.

According to Losce and Jen Kyvig. concerts
funded by the committee cannot be held in Bob’s
Underground or in dorm lounges such as Gardner.
whtch is now considered a lounge for Main Hall.
Concerts Committee can only fund events open to the
whole campus, and these locations are too small to
hold enough people to qualify as allrcampus events.

Weekday parties wtth alcohol are prohibited in
the Harris Center; only alcohol free studyrbreaks
ending before midnight are allowed, and these are
generally poorly attended, according to Losee.

Thissemester Concerts Committee isagain short
on dates. “I’ll take full responsibility for it,” suited
Kyvig. who said she turned iher date preferences in
late last semester due to papers and sickness. Most
dates had already been scheduled for other campus
events.

To compensate for few dates this semester, “the
committee decided to organize bigger name stuff
which seems to make people more satisﬁed," accord
ing to Kyvig, noting that “smaller concerts last 5e.
mester were not very well attended.”

The merger last fall of the two biggest Midwest

 

booking agencies, Triad and William Morris. also
created problems. according to committee members.

“I think tt's a triumph Lhtit we actually got a hold
of anyone or booked anyone last semester." said
Concerts Committee member Portia Sabin. “No one
was answering the phones,”

Grinncll College was notattlietopol‘theircontaci
list. Kyvrg said. “The agencies have so many bigger
fish to fry.”

The committee's concert publicity was not as
good as itmighthave been last semester.according to
Kyvig. However, she countered criticisms of excesr
sive committee secrecy about which bands they were
trying to bring to campus, saying that the committee is
legally bound not to publicize a concert until the
contract has been signed.

Students also criticized Concerts Committee for
ignoring suggestions made to the committee and not
returning calls or computer messages. Committee
members said they take all suggestions mto consider»
auon. citing Consoltdatcrl as an example of ti group
first suggested by someone outside the committee.

However. they said booking many of the sug
gested bands is either impossible or undesirable.

“Some of the suggestions we get from people are
asinine," Miller said. Other groups are contacted but
usuallytum out tobe toocxpensive, notintcrested.not
touring or unavailable for the dates Concerts Commit—
tee has reserved, said Kyvig.

She encouraged people with band suggestions to
contact members of the committee, which includes
Kyvig, Miller, Sabin. Sam Dilorio, Meridith Goulet.
Jon Rose, Jeremy Lipshutz, Justus Nieland. Dinah
Marder, Kristy Johnson, Ben Wohlauer and Isaac
Henderson. The Concerts computer account is cur
rently not in use.

Kyvig said she understands the controversy over
the concerts billing last semester. but believes there
always has been and will be a few people dissatisfied
with any concerts the committee brings.

"You can’t please all the people all the
time.”stated Kyvig.
