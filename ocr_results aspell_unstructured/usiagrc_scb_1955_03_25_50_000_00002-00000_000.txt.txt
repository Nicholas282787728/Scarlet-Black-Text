Editorial

Last year a sociology class made a survey of a number
of Grinnell students to discover why they had chosen a
small liberal arts college. A great proportion of the students
answered “because I won’t be just a number" and “more
personal and informal contact with the faculty”. One is far
from a number at Grinnell, but the student-faculty relation-
ship is not what the incoming freshman expects it to be.

The existing relationships between students and faculty
members center around the class room, the professor’s
office, ”informal" but organized coffee hours and colloquia,
This sounds like plenty, but actually the same contacts are
available to the student in the large university.

What is the intangible extra that incoming student
expects and deserves on the grounds of college publicity?
It’s a casual meeting which winds up in a spontaneous
invitation for coffee in the union. It‘s an occasional visit
to a professor’s house. More than that, it's a feeling of being
able to have these things, and have them offered, without

the asking.

Why don’t we have more of them? I ' partly due to
the student's fear that ”other" students will call it apple-
polishing, a fear that all too frequently proves true, But we
have a suspicion that this accusation of apple-polishing is
simply a cover»up on the part of the students who wish
to have faculty friendships too. And why don‘t they'l First,
there is the feeling that the initial move is up to the pro-
fessor, simply because of his status. Secondly, students
frequently feel that the professor begrudges the time, even if
he does not indicate it. And thirdly. the students feel some-
times that they have little to offer. Paradoxically, most pro-
fessors say that one of the reasons that they chose teach-
ing as a career was the constant challenge and stimulus

provided by their students.

We feel that because of this inhibited attitude on the
part of the students, it is not only proper but obligatory
for the faculty members to make the first move in break-
ing down the barriers. The process of teaching and learning

will be richer for it.

no The Editor:

’l‘wo weeks ogo, the student
council passed a motion approv-
ing one change in the Board of
Publicshons from a student cone
trolled committee to a faculty
committee. The motion, offered
by Ken Kassebaum, sc presi»
dent, indicated only the approval
of one sludenl council. However
this was all the faculty asked;
general student approval was not
requested.

The action went by apparently
unnoticed and uncriticized even
‘by the 58:13. Yet by bhis oclion,
the student council eliminated
any hope of retaining in student
hands the board that supervises
student publicau'ons financed en-
tirely by student money and ad-
verising and put out completely
by students. 15 this apahhy or is
it downright sabotage of student
government?

The old Board of Publications
was a good example of student
responsibility in managing stud-
em: uﬁairs. Composed of six
students, three faculty members,
.and one administration repro-
sentutive, it was a good base on
wlhich increased student control
of student afIairs could have
been built. Under the change,
there are only four students on
«he board, with total faculty and
administration representation in.
creased to five. By its action, the
student council has set back
student government.

In his campaign, Ken said he
would tzy to work with the pre-

sent student government setup
to improve it. Is this improving
it? He also stated that he would
start action on a comprehensive
new constitution 'for student
government. It seems inconsist-
ant to relinquish student control
in one area while trying to ob-
tain greatly increased student
power in all areas.

How can the body that sup»
poscdly repl'Esents all he stud-
cns of Grinnell college vote
approval of a change that takes
a ivellriunctioning committee,
which has not been faculty cone
trolled for years, out of student
hands for no reason connected
with its past and present opera-
tlon’.’

it would seem that the stud
ent council has become unwilling
to resist expropriation of legi-
mate student power.

Perhaps all lihis seems fantay
tic. i think it is. But i lhink the
reason for its fantastic quality
lies in the lack of information
on which members of the sludcni
council based their vote and on
the negligible presentation of the
student side in ohe discussion.
One member indicated surprise
at ever having apnrovnd such n
change and intimated that
”something was put over on us.”

This matter should ncl be c)”
sidered settled. Th vucmv‘
council should hear the student
side of uhc argument’ i than

The SOUnd
and
The Fury

by Art Travers

In the editorial section of last
week's 5&5, there was a pro-
posed alteration for future Con—
cert and lecture Series. For
those of you who missed said
editorial, the proposal was for
one name act rather than three
of four seconderate performers.
Well, as the man says, I'll buy
that.

Last year, for example, we
were exposed to one Henry L.
Scott whose advance advertising
labeled him as "America‘s best
piano Satirist." Expectation ran
high. 0n the big night, Henry L.
played to an 51w audience de~
spile the rain outside. To the
hearty applause of the Grinnell
student body, [Hank appeared
nattily attired in white tie and
tails, sprightly danced over to
the piano and fell over the piano
bench. Someone laughed (the
woxst possible thing to do) and
Henry L. was off and running.

There isn't any pressing need
to describe in detail the atrocity
which followed. It sufﬁces to say
that by the end of his act he was
playing to a sso (strong stom-
achs only) audience. For the
most part, this year's batting or-
der isn’t making any more hits.
(Although the audiences are
keeping up in the home-run de-
partment.) It certainly wouldn't
hurt to try the name act idea
once.

As far as this main act is con-
cerned, I should like to tender
the name of Dave Brubeck. Bru—
beck is a bona fide jazz man
whose good taste and inventive-
ness have made him extremely
popular to record buying public.
His quartet featuring Paul Des»
mend on alto sax is a Well-knit
group which is remarkable in its
never ending flow of ideas.

Now I realize that there is
something about the term “jazz"
which connotes burdellos, nar»
cotics and bath-tub gin. Nothing
Could be further from the truth.

A‘l Na‘l'. Debate

Grinnell debaters Pat Larru~

approximately seventh in the
elimination meet of the Nation-

coln, Nebraska, March 21. Only
the top five teams will attend
the national conference to be
held at West Point, April 2143.

Ten schools from nine states
took part in the trial contest,
eligibility being detennined by
the season’s record of all col-
leges in the midwest area. Grins
hell was ranked eighth in pre-
contest statistics.

“Although the debate sea-
son is officially closed, we may
send a representative to the
Delta Sigma Rho regional
meet to be held at the Univer-
sity of Oklrhoma, April 15 and
16," revealed Mr. William
Vanderpool (speech). There is
also a possibility that a two-
member Grinnell team will
participate in the Marquette
University meet on May 15.
