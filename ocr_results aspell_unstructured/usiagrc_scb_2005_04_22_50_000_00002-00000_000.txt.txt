never heard or an initiative being ree
jcctcd before." Chang said. “It was re
jected despite my best efforts."

According to Blackman, the student
initiative process was not the proper
venue for Chang's particular goals. At
the Joint Board meeting this week,
Blackman explained that the primary
goal of the initiative was to inform the
campus rather than ask the student
body to give an opinion on a certain is
sue. “[This] is not really what student
initiatives are for,” he said. “The way
wt: sec student initiatives . is to show
student support for issues that could be
enacted."

Chang did not disagree with El k-
man's assessment. “I wanted the in
live to inform the people to inform
the campus," he said. “My initiative was
to motivate students to realize things
that were wrong and the fact that there
is room for improvement.”

Chang also pointed out that he re,
ceived 108 student signatures to have
the initiative on the ballot. “My goal
was to get it on the ballot," he said.

Senator for Loosehead Ellen Sits
terwhite ‘05, who read the initiative,
called it ”a series of ad hominem at-
tacks." SGA President Mark Henry
called the initiative “a bunch of rants."

Chang acknowledged that “for
some people it just looked like a bitter
senior and a list of Complaints. I don't
want to be offensive, I want people to

Deadlines extended for
SPARC and SGA cabinet

Cabinet had 25 applicants by Thursday deadline; SPARC still
searching for students for next year’s committee

BY KATIE JARES

This past week, the Student Publications and Ra»
dio Committee (SPARC) extended its application
deadline for next year’s Committee, while SGA also
extended the deadline for next year’s cabinet nppllcilr
tions.

SPARC elections were originally scheduled to take
place on Thursday, along with student initiatives, but
SPARC received only one email expressmg interest
and no actual applications by the Tuesday deadline,
according to SPARC assistant treasurer Phyo Bakyu
‘06. The committee decided to extend the deadline
until sometime nortweek and more actively solicit
applications.

As ofThursday, a few people had expressed inter-
est in SPARC, but no one had yet filed an application,
said Bakyu. The committee plans to hold a general
election later in the semester.

For the 20054006 SGA Cabinet, next year's SGA
president john Bohman be and vice president Ch is
Ochoa ’06 received over 20 applications by the ori
rial Friday, April 15 deadline, but “there was less ofan
interest for certain positions," said Bohman. Bohman
and ochoa extended the deadline untilTnesday, April
19, and Boliman said they now have 25 applicants.
Cabinet members are selected by “Ext year's president
and vice president and these selections are then up
proved by this year’s Joint boaid.

Bohmnn and Ochoa said that the deadline exten-
sion was not due to lack of interest. “We were really
excited and pleased with the quality of the first round
of applicants and would have been happy to form a
cabinet from that pool," wrote Bohman via email.
“That being said, some of the positions were more

competitive than others, so we decided to extend the
deadline in order to bring every position up to the
same level of competitiveness."

In addition. Bohman said, some of the original
applicants were student staff members, who are pro-
hibited from holding offices by the SGA constitu-
tion. "Seeing as there was an unusually high number
ofapplicints for student staff, it is more likely that
students are choosing to exercise selfrgovernance by
being SAs and HSCs," he wrote.

According to Bohman, SGA has not had similar
problems in cabinet applications in previous years,
For the 2004-2005 cabinet, there was a “particularly
strong showing"of37 applicants, he said.

For SPARC, however, trouble ﬁnding interested
students is nothing new. “Last year six people ran
for five positions, the year before that seven or eight
people run, and the year before that five people Ian,”
wrote SPARC members in a statement to the S558.

SPARC oversees a third of the student activi-
ties fce, which forms the budgets of five permanent
projects: the sorts, the Cyclone, KDIC, the Giitnie/I
Review, and the Gum. it also covers temporary publi-
cations funded on a semester-to—semester basis.

In their statement, SPARC said that they have
"frequently failed to attract the attention of the ems
dent body because we are an inherently responsive
organization. So, when it comes time to run elec-
tions the nature ofthc committee’s purpose makes it
difficult to find interested candidates."

ifnor enough candidates express interest, SPARC
is unsure ofits next steps. They will probably discuss
options with Strident Affairs, according to treasurer

Felix Zhu ‘05.
