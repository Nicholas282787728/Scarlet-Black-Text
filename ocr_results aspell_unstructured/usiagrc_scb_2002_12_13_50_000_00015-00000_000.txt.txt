There is no other place to had hot, wet, ripped and barely clothed
Grinnellians. but at swim meets (and the occasional l—latris party).
But one should not come to the meets just for the eye candy. Rather,
on: should come to watch the best team in the Midwest Conference.
With both the men’s and womm’s teams offto aZ-O start, the team
sent their top swimmers and diveis this past weekend to an invin-
tional meet at the University ochbmkrr-Omaha, At this meet swim-
mats and divers alike, were able to compete against Division ll ath—
lctcs. The nltc thing about the meet is that it holds no value towards
either teams respective records. The only incentive For the swim.
mers was the intense competition.

“All i wlll say is that it was deﬁnitely a meet that I'll rim/er forget,
ever," said captain Eric “Country" Blevins '04. Besides resembling
the Grmk god Poseidon every time he exits
the water, Country is one :xrtemcly good
diver. He managed to finish second this past
weekend. although according to many on the
diving team the judges did not see in to give
him proper scores for his dives.

“There were people on our re'am that n:-
ccivcd 1's and 2’: when they should have been
getting as,“ stated diving standout Sarah
stayer '05. “it was great for Country to place
second, but again his scores wereso law. He
is such a better diver now than he was his ﬁrst year, but his scores
were lower than when he Won conference For the ﬁrst time."

Despite the scoriiigdiscrepaneies, thc meet was good for the divers
