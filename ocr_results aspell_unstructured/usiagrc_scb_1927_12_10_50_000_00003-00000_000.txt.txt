Dear Editor:

It is Withsonle trepidation that an
alumnus of comparatively recent vint~
age writes to the students now adorn-
ing his Alma Mater. However, as one

any storms which might arise and
leave it to your Wise discretion,wlle—
ther or not this shuuld be published.
I assure you I shall be brief.

During my four years at Griilnell it
was my pleasure to Watch the build-
ing of some football teams of which
any institution might be proud. These
teams were built just as the one which
will represent Grinnell in 1328 is be-
ing built, but they had nothing like

, the baptism of fire to Which the 1927
team has been subjected. It is not a
pleasant thing, and far from an easy
thing to accept such a, season as has
just closed. May I say; Mr. Editor, that
it is nevertheless a. Very fine thing for
a team Do keep improving under such
circumstances. for a. bunch of bulls to
mainmln a high standard of sports—
manship and Spirit in the face of such
circumstances. I onCe heard a Grin-
nell conch tell his team that it was

Dear Sir:

Is the discrepancy between the vats
ing and the military ages quite in
keeping with that phrasing in our Colli-
stltution, the ”of by and for" clause
which talks about the 110017167 The
pertinent question occurs to lls
whether boys are ever people even
though they die defending flags and
causes. Whose country and wbnso
cause. we wonder,

Perhaps the most characteristic
thing about college men and other
men under twenty-one is their disl c
of being Coddled. It is a characteristic
which we not only admire but respect.
Shall we not respect even more um
dignity in them which more or less
actively resents the complacency or
middle age which is responsible [or a
patriotism endowed, like gods oi old,
with the right to demand human sacrir
lice? Being led like lambs to the
slaughter is as objectionable and on
much the same ground, as that cod-
dling wbicb, because they are men,
they can't endure.

Delense of country is an elastic
term but it will baydly hear the stretch
required to make it mean defense or
some few peoples’ property, much less
no defense of lhose ideas which are err
tertained by some about it, Being
communists with respect to boys but
not to properly is a. discrimination
