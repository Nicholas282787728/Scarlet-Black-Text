Although the “Grinnell-ACM Model for
Black Student, Faculty, and Staff Recruit»
ment and Retention" has not yet been
published, a draft of the model has been
made available to the Scarlet and Black.

The report, which stems from a National
Minority Affairs Conference hosted at
Grinnell last fall. attempts “to provide a
resource formula for long term efforts re»
quired to develop" a diverse campus, par-
ticularly with respect to Black Americans.

The .model cites the need {or commit-
ment on the part of the trustees and ad
ministration to create and implement a
policy oi campus diversity. i

Recruitment of Black faculty and ads
ministrators is given priority status with
better fringe benefits as well as more fre-
quent sabbaticals considered strong
possibilities as incentives to stay with
“small, liberalearts colleges, historically
populated by a large majority of middle
class white students and staffed by white
professors and administrators ”

A need “to recruit Black students of a
variety of socio-economic backgrounds
and levels of academic achievement" also
ls cited.

In addition to increased counseling sere
vices and summer program. a revision of
financial aid policy is seen as necessary.

The model also suggests “Incentive
packages [where] minority students
receive more outright scholarship
assistance with a minimum of loans and
jobs as part or lthel package.”

in determining financial aid awards. the
study says. “Students’ expected summer
earnings should be minimal or non-
existent, as it is difficult for minority

students to acquire any kind of summer
employment." Also, summer programs to

help “Make up deficiencies or to acquire
advanced academic Skills" should be col-

The GrinnellsACM Model which urges
action “Here and now [as] tomorrow may

the A.C.M. Wingspread Conterence in

Black history month

by May—lee Chai

February is Black History Month, and
Grinnell has a Variety of events scheduled
“To show the contributions Black
Americans have made towards making
America what she is today,” according to
Quentin Johnson. Director of Minority Afr
fairs. .

Johnson stressed that these events were
not selected solely on the recommenda-
tions of the Office of Minority Affairs but
also from suggestions and requests made
by various students and student groups.

In light of the recent plethora or media
attention paid to the "Crisis in Black
America” tto quote the Bill MoyerssCBS
television documentary that recently
highlighted increasing problems within
black familiesi. Johnson is particularly
pleased with the selection of Dr. J. Her-
man Blake. President of Tougaloo College
as a Scholar‘s Convocation speaker

”The focus of his address is the struggle
Within Black America as a developing
social community," Johnson said. “The
largest minority group in the country.
Black iamilies are still not~on a par, par
ticularly in relation to income levels. with
White families. with educational stans
dards below that of White America,

He added “Life within the urban ghetto
Black community is very violent. and we
really don't get a true picture of the sting»
gle among people to survive. to eat. to
have a place to lay their heads. [as well
as] to educate their children.”

“Middle class Black Americans who
have been able to improve [their own]
socio-eeonomlc status are going to have to
get the information to those that are less
fortunate that education is the key to sucs
cess and socioeconomic equality."
Johnson said.

Johnson ieels Blake's lecture on “The
Future of Our Past: Black Students and
Higher Education," will help address
these ditiiculties in getting intormation to
the under-privileged.

"Grinnell College has made a concen
trated etiort in working toward these ei‘~
forts," Johnson stated

As proof. he cited the National Minority
Alfairs Conierence hosted by Grinnell this
past iall. September 26728. The resulting
report, entitled "The Grinnell-ACM
[Associated Colleges or the Midwest]
Model tor Black Student. Faculty. and
Staff Recruitment and Retention” will be
published sometime later this month or
early March.

”Black History Month helps to recognize
that. yes. there have been a lot of ac
complishments that Black' people have
made through the years," Johnson said.
“But it also helps people realize the strug-
gle tor the dream oi equality that Dr. Mar-
tin Luther king. Jr. presented is constant
and everlasting."

In addition to the events listed on the
campus calendar the Young, Giited. and
Black Choir will perform four times this »
month both on-carnpus and off-campus. All
events are open to the entire student body.
