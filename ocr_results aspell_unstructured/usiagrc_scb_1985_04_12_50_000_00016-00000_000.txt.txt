Grass Roots vs. Senator Grassely

Last April 3. the Presrdent asked Con-
gress lor $14 million to iund "the Chris
tian and democratic crusade being
waged in Nicaragua by the Freedom
Commandos." Sources at the lowa
Campaign to Stop the War in Central
America say that the request will be
considered by the House and Senate.
with avote expected sometime between
April 17 and 24.

1'he'lssue has proved time and again
to be of national interest. and while
V\ ashington has been besieged with a
natinnwtde response oi protest. the
Iowa constituency has remained at the
torelront oi the movement. Thus. it
comes as no surprise that the debate
over renewed iunding lor the counter-
insurgency in Nicaragua has roots so
close to home. As the issue comes to a
boil in Washington the Iowa Campaign
to Stop the War in Central America. and
Its Grinnell altiliate. will have a
statewtde campaign meeting tomor-
row. April 13. at 11:00 am. in Gardner
Lounge.

‘The Iowa Campaign to stop the War
in Central America is the umbrella
organization for the Pledge of
Resistance. which is organized at the
local. state. regional. and national
levels in order to respond to issues
tsuch as contra aid) ettectively and
orderly at the national level. last
February Jim Wallis. the national coor-
dinator oi the "Pledge" reported that
oiei- 42.000 people had joined the move-
ment nationwide. There are over 50
participants on the Grinnell campus
alone.

Weekend Events

Un Saturday one at the main issues
likely to be discussed is active non-
violence: is civu disobedience ap
propriate in the event that the contra
aid bill passes the congressional
debate? However. it is probable that
the center of attention will be Focused
on Senator Charles Grassley lR-lal. A
large portion at Sen, Grassley's constir
tuency has been requesting all year
long that he make a trip back home.
They. along with many other Iowans.
would like Sen. Grassley to explain why
he is supporting the Reagan ad—
ministration in its crusade to rearm the
counterinsurgency which the Presi-
dent so warmly embraced as nextotkin
to our ”loundlng fathers." Thus far,
Sen. Grassley has reinsed to givea
public briefing to Iowans at home.

Quite by coincidence, Senator
(rl‘assley is scheduled to appear betore

the Grinnell town meeting in South
Lounge at 2:00 pm. this Saturday. at
the same time that the statewide COOP
dinatingcommitteeis ‘scussinghowto
get him to listen to the ll of this may
seem strange in quiet Grinnell. Iowa,
but it has caught the eye oi the media as
well: NBC-TV has expressed an in»
terest in covering themeeting. Though
Sen, Grassley may not hear LS. NBC
would like to remind everybody that we
are here. The subject oi their story 7
"Grassroots Lobbying on the Contra
Vote."

We must. however. give Grassley his
due A for while he hasn‘t the time to
briel Iowans on the contra aid bill, he
has recently invited lowans (those of
you who can allord the trip) to spend a
sunny spring atternoon talking politics
in Washington. On April 19 a much
smaller group oi lowans. who have
managed to raise enough money to rent
a couple of vans. will meet with Senator
Grassley where he is at home.

Robert Curley

'l'he Grinnell contingent at the Pledge
ol Resistance will be represented by the
Iederation of lowans who are opposing
the contra aid bill and arranging the
brieﬁng with Sen. Grassley. As the vote
is likely to occur soon atter Congress‘
Easter/Passover recess. Iowans are
hoping that through this briefing Sen.
Urassley will Come to terms with his
constituents. After all. the Senator is up
ltlr reelection in 1986.

soiiator oiassloy has supported tho
Administration's lundilig oi the contras
ill the past. citing the Administration's
argument that the contras are stopping
-ged weapons shipments from
N uragua to El Salvador. However.
many experts, Iowans included. have
disputed the arms shipment allegation.
claiming the Administration has
iepeatedly tailed to prove it and has
never interdicted any weapons
shipments.

Iowa Brieﬁng

Early this year. Sen. Lii’assley agreed
with the Iowans to set up a briefing in
Washington regarding the arms ship
merit issue. The brieiing would pit Ad-
ministration experu against its critics.
Sen. urassley agreed to invite State
Department or Pentagon experts to

lilake their case. and he said that the ‘
Iowans could nanle brielers who would
p- sent opposing views, ‘
the Iowa Campaign to stop the War
in Central America. which is’
lepresented in Crime“. named they
lulloviing experts to present their case:

David MacMichael. was a tormer top.
CIA analyst who was in charge of
reviewing all intelligence iniormation’
about alleged arm trailic from
Nicaragua to the Salvadoran rebels.‘
MacMichael left the CIA charging that
the “arms trafficking" issue was mere-'
ly smokescreen for the Administra- t
tioii's real intention or overthrowing the
Nicaraguan government. Concerningl
the armsllow MacMichael said: ”This
has been the linchpin of American ‘
policy. It is the only legal justification k
that has been advanced by the Ad-
ministration land] What l've been.
pointing out is that the evidence lor
those armsflow is almost totally lack-i
mg." .

Mr. MacMichael will be accompanied '
by Col. Edward King iUS Army ret.i
and Raymond Bonner. Col. King has
spent much time in Central America
tracking dovin the alleged arms
shipmean in an attempt to provide cone,
elusive evidence one way or the other
regarding the Administration's accusa- .
lions: and Mr. Bonner is a former cor-
respondent ior The New York Times
who covered Central American attairs
lEl Salvador in particularl for a
number at years.

Senator Grassley has said he insists
that the contras only be involved in in-
let-dieting arms. that they not beengags
ed in terrorism. and that they not atel
tempt to overthrow the Nicaraguan
government. Sen, Grassley may or may ’
not be blind to the atrocities which the ‘
"Freedom commandos" have commit
ted in the Nicaraguan countryside .
which is almost entirely inhabited by
lal'mers. But in either case. on behalf of '
the Iowa Campaign to Stop the War in
Central America. l (eel that the upcom- ‘
iiig Vlashington briefing will help prove .
that the contra funding has tailed on all
three accounts,
