Freshmen: How
Different are They?

Hopkins says

Class of

by May-lee Chal

This year's freshman class is historic [or
a number or reasons. They are the last
class to be admitted under the old admis»
sions policy. They are the first class that
will graduate in the 1990’s, And as for “the
,objective quality oi this class, it is better,"
according to John R. Hopkins. Director of
Admission.

This year's ireshman scored an average
SAT math score higher than any class for
the past 14 years Their verbal SAT
average tops those train 11 years back.

This highlyrtouted rise in “quality"
reflects the increase in the size of the ap-
plicant pool. For the 1985 treshman class.
there were some 1.300 applications to Grins
nell. The class of 1990 was culled from
almost 1.80&

”It was simply a iunction oi selection —
there were more people irom whom to
select.” Hopkins said.

Despite rumors to the contrary. this
class does not otherwise significantly difr
fer from previous freshmen classes. The
geographical distribution has remained
iairly constant as well as the reasons why
the studens chose to come to Grinnell in
the first place.

"Grinnell still \draws students who are

. attracted to the type of program we offer.
the chance to do independent work and
research. They like the tutorial; they like
the geographic distribution“ Hopkins
sald.

He did note that more students were ate
tracted to Grinnell because of the college’s
reputation. “Grinnell's reputation is grow
ing on a nationwide basis and there's just
no question about that. It‘s helped us in-
crease the size oi the applicant pool.”
Hopkins said

Hopkins dispelled one irequent comment
irom upperclassmen about this year s
freshmen being more conservative than in
years past.

“As far as the conservativerliberal
thing. I‘ve heard that each of the last it
years. i think that’s a pretty normal come
ment. To some extent I think seniors forget
what they were like when they were
freshman

Although some ireshmen have com»
plained ahout overcrowding this year. the
major discomiorts experienced last year
have notbeen repeated, Last yeara record
423 new students flooded the dorms requir»
ing some lounges to be converted into
dorms and singles to .be converted into
doubles and even triples. Although a ”wait
list" was used for the first time this year.
Hopkins says the smaller enrollment of 333
students this [all was not necessarily due
to a more discriminate admission policy

“To some extent less people decided to
come. That‘s a factor of yield.” he said.
“Also, some oi the overcrowding last year
was due to returning students. not just new
students. So we made our target class Just
about where we thought it would come in."

This class will also mark the end of the
old admission policy that sent all applicar

tlonS below certain benchmarks to the five
person Admission Board. This resulted in
the Board's having to consider over BOD ap
plications Quite often Board members
were forced to burn the midnight oil.
Hopkins remembers seeing “poor Gerry
Lalonde here till midnight almost every
night."

The new admission policy will require
that the Board review only “the middle

Grinnellian Treks
t0 U.S.S.R. for Peace

by May lee Chai

Although Congress may have given up
on SALT II and the superpowers are
unable to agree on arms reductions. one
Grinneilian has not given up on promoting
peace. This fall Jean Mayes traveled to the
Soviet Union as part Ma 40 member Peace
Odyssey citizens group to promote peace
through understanding

Mayes. a lormer French teacher who Is
now continuing her studies at the Universir
ty of Iowa. said she felt a responsibilir
ty as an educator to try to develop this
awareness.

The Peace Odyssey met with various
Soviet Peace committees in three main
cities. Moscow, Tbilisi, and Volgograd,
These Peace Committees were sanctioned
by the government and usually had some
paid personnel. but Mayes stressed that
they were not government organs.
Sometimes people from the outside would
be invited to attend.

“In Volgograd. there were a lot or people
who were interested in the peace issues
and who could speak enough English so
that we could break into small groups.
That was perhaps one oi the most iruitiul
meetings because we were on a one-to-one
situation.” Mayes said.

Mayes said that the group was not
retricted by the government as tar as
walking on the streets and meeting or-
dinary Soviets was concerned. “Any lack
of freedom was due to time," she said. The
group traveled to many cities and was his
vited to numerous cultural events. such as
concerts and plays. in each.

Often chance encounters on the street or
Just talking to Soviet citizens who happen-
ed to be sitting next to them during
cultural periormances provided the group
with opportunities to get to know die
Soviets better. Sometimes group members
would be invited to the person’s home or to
lunch.

For example. Mayes struck up a conver-
sation with a woman sitting next to her
who turned out to be a secondary school
English teacher. Mayes had brought a
number of letters irom seventh graders in
the Grinnell Middle School and gave them
to the woman who promised to share them
with her classes.

So far the Grinnellians have not received

any letters in response.

Mayes. who first learned or the Peace
Odyssey group through a small classified
ad in 'a magazine. said she had not
originally intended to go this tall.
However. her involvement with other
peace activities In iowa changed her mind.

“When the Great Peace March came
through iiowai. l was quite involved with
the hosting oi that group in Iowa City. on
that time I was living in Iowa City) . . It .
was a real consciousnessvraising‘time.

“It was partly because oi the en
thusiasm that was generated through that
activity that I really hopped on the bands

wagon to go to the Soviet Union as soon as!
did , . I was just so fired up." Mayes said.

She lelt she could not pass up this opporr
tunity to “inform myself and to take slides
and to also bring back materials in the
hope of heightening awareness that the
Soviet Union is made up or people who are
human beings like we are.”

Mayes has given talks on her trip in the
University at Iowa and to a group of stu-

‘dent teachers She has also been approach

ed by two groups in Grinnell. She says she
would be happy to answer questions regar-
ding her trip. Also. students may be in-
terested in going on a future Peace
Odyssey trip to the U.S.S.R. as it was quite
reasonably priced.
