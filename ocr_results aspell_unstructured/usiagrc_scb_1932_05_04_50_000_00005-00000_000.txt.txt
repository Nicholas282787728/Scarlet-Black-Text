And with muttered curses against
dramatics in general and technical
work in particular, William Fryol'
and Jam'es More set about nursing
their bruised and bleeding hands.
Scratched in the cause of “The Mer-
chant of Venice," the two martyrs
demonstrated their hardihood by ini-
meoliately resuming work on proper-
ties for the Shakespearean play,
spring production of the drama de-
partment scheduled for presentation
the latter part of May and at come
mencement.

Nerts! The curtains have fallen
down again. in exasperation three
overall-clad maidens call on the mar
tyrs for assistance. and order is
speedily restored. Sans thimble and
sans seiving machine, said maidens—
Margucnte Kouecny, Lois Lyon, and
Louise Leach—have completely res
made the stage curtains. By experi-
menting with dyes, they have redyed
the old curtains a roserbl'own shade.
so that by a change of lights, a dif—
ferent background will result.

“A Penetrating Odor"

“Stlpplmg the steps” may sound
like a catch—phrase for a new dance
routine. but to Irma Cooper, Maurice
Birtlsall. Louise Smith, and Frances
Collins, it i just another angle of
preparation for the play. The columns
and baliistrades are also at the mer-
cies of this group

Leaving the auditorium workers
and jaunting over to the workshop
under Rand gymnasium, a different
and more pungent atmosphere is ens
countered. it penetrating- odor, faint-
ly reminiscent of Blair hall laborar
tories, emanates from mysterious
looking pails and buckets scattered

changes in the football code. Having
seen the rules under fire, Coach Mur—

certain of the changes are not for the

the 1932 model kickoff and to the
rule which declares the ball “dead"

that more, rather than fewer injur-
