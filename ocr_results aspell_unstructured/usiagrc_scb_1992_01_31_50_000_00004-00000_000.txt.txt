By India Weston

On January 20, Grinnell students
and employees could be found sitting
in front of television sets in anticipa-
tion of The Oprah Winfrey Show. The
main attraction was none other than
our own Kesho Scott, professor of
American Studies and Sociology

While on a promotional tour for
her new book "The Habit of Surviv-
ing," Professor Scott was asked to
appear on the show to discuss “rac-
ism in the neighborhood.” She stated
that she was surprised to discover that
Klu KluxKlanmembers were present.
and to see the group upsurge again,
she said, is “very scary."

Because of her “expertise on unA
learning racism." and a letter written
to neighbors after her children were
harassed which asked them to talk to

their children about racism, Profes-
sor Scott stated she felt she “had
something to contribute." To be able
to define racism on the show was
something she also found impomnt.

At one point during the show, an
ex-KKK family apologized to their
black neighbors. This act prompted
Professor Scott to call the show “his
torict" Although she did not feel that
theblackfamilyunderstoodthe“mag-
nitude" of the act, the gesture, she
said, was very symbolic.

In addressing theeity ofDubuque,
Scott stated that she was not trying to
offer a solution to their problem, but
merely “some way to understand the
dynamics of [the] community,” Al-
though she feels that the number of
blacks as compared to whites in
Dubuque would pose no threat, she
stated that “white powerlessness
doesn’t have to be racist.” She has
since been asked to lead a workshop
in Dubuque, a project in which she
has much experience. She stated that
she does notjust raise the conscious-
ness of people,but teaches skills with
which to unleam racism.
