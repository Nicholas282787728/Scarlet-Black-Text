agreed that a number ot other peo—

him,

Neal Trabich and Linda Wurmley
requested that their hearing be com»

spectators but also the press.

Chris Fl‘eeburg’s 9:30 p.m. hear-

Commenting on the report, Presi-

survey shows, the college is highly
important to the economy or Grin—
nell. But we at the college never
iorget that ‘community’ means an
interdependent group of people
working tor the good of the whole.

“it the college benefits the city
economically and culturally, the city
returns these benefits in the re
sources, people, and good will it
provides to iacilitiate college opere
ations. We certainly intend to main~
tain this healthy relationship."

other Freeburg witnesses coll-
tended thnt he was being selected
as a scapegoat. Rick Brockland de-
nied this charge emphatically,
claiming that if he had been able to
identify “30 people, there would be
so people here facing charges”.
Charges were brought against the
(our people who hzld been identi-
fied, he continued Both Brockland
and Ralph Pomerenk emphasized
that the charges were brought not
only because the [boot light was an-
noying to a number oi students but
because such incidents createa “poe

to a t-shirt with a large turkey em~

and a pair or bright purple tights,
he concluded his testimony by de
claring “to say that Chris Frees

First Half lead Vanishes

Grinnell Jumped out to a and

neers took the lead Zlezo with 3.09

They then pumped in 17 points dur-
ing the last tew minutes while Penn
managed only tour.

The edge was surely with the Pio-
neers at this point, They were play

working beauiitully, the shots were
going in, the rebounds came down in
the hands of the right people and
the deiense was magniticent, Bill
Bailey scored 17 or his 25 points
in the hall, and the play or Rico
Williams and Rick Sturgeonwas out-
standing. in tact, everyone wasplaye
ing well,

Then came the disastrous second
halt obviously stirred by a blise

coaches, Penn put the heat on Grin-

The relaxed Pioneers were taken
by surprise and seemed to stiiien

Tomato Plant Discovered

by John Wylie

Senior Nikki Tannenbaum had an
unusual visitor on November 30--
Grinnell Police Chief Bill Peters
came by to iind out if the plant
growing in her second rloor window
was marijuana, Fortunately, itwase
n’t.

“l have some really sickly look»
ing tomato piantsgrowingin mywin»
dew”, explained Ms. Tannehbaum.
Someone driving by Read hall saw
them, and, thinking they were mar-
ijuand, complained to the police de-
partment.

”One or our olticers drove by at
night, and he told me he wasn’t sure
Whether or not the plant was mari-
juana”, Chief Peters explained to
the state. The next day, Peters came

OUR
CUR

on campus himseli to check out the
suspicious—looking plant

Peters discovered that the plants
were indeed tomato plants, and that
ended the matter. He explained to
the 5&8 that no search warrant was
required tor his visit to the campus
because the plant in question was
visible trom the street, Police ole
ticers do not need a warrant to in
vestigate iuriher in such cases, Pee
ters added.

Ms, Tannenbaum says she has no
idea who might have made the com-
plaint, and chiet Peters would not
comment on the identity or the come
plainant beyond saying that it was
someone passing Read Hall on East
street,

change. When a society or a college
tolerates intimidation (the physical
means oi settling disputes), thenthat
society or college loses its moral
right to exist as a social system or
institution,

Political mass civil disobedience
is only appropriate as a declara-
tion ol 3 total break with n coun-
try’s political institutions-as an
“invitation” to civil war. The same
is true at a college.

There has been a ploy used by
student rebels to obfuscate their
guilt as provocateurs who commit
acts at tome and place the blame
on their victim. This has been done
by attempting to establish a spec
ial distinction between iorce and
violence

Coercion, they claim, by means of
literal physical contact is “viov
lence” and or course reprehensible;
any other means of violating rights
is simply “force" and thus a legi-
timate peaceful method of dealing
with their opponents.

if this distinction were made a
rule or social conduct, then it you
round a stranger occupying your
room one evening and were to bod-
ily throw him out, he would have
only committed a peaceiul act of
“force", whereas you would beguil-
ty of “violence” and you should be
punished.

The real purpose of this distince
tion is to create a moral inversion:
to make the initiation oiiorce moral
and the resistance to force immor-
al; thus the right of self-detense is
obliterated,

it students are going to be treated
as mature human beings, it theyare
going to be given responsibility as
members of an “academic commun-
ity", then the only proper response
to acts oi iorce on their part is an
attitude of ﬁrmness and uncompruV
mising severity.
