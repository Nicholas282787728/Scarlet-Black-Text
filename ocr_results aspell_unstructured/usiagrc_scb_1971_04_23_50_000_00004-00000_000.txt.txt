THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Campus Racial Concerns Voiced

ANALYSIS:
first of a series
by Greg Butcher

Last week Dean of Students
Conney Kimbo, CBS president
Da'vid Weston, SGA president
Shelley Floyd, AWS president
Kathy Ellis, CofHP president
Mario Bognanno, and the S&B
received an anonymous letter
from a group of white stud-
ents concerning black-white
relations on campus.

The letter asserts that "cars
tain black students, within the
college community, are em-
ploying the ‘guilt complex‘ of
white America and the pre-
dominately white student body
as a tool to attain racial sups
eriority."

Although disagreeingwith the
style and content ofmuch ofthc
letter and distressed by the
anonymity of its authors, I
nevertheless believe that it is
part of a growing sense of
discontent among white stud-
ents about blacktwhitc relar
tions on campus today.

Another overt symptom of
the discontent was Saturday's
room draw, in which white
males tended not to draw into
Younker Hall, home of the
black cluster arrangement
this year and next. Younker,
traditionally one of the most
popular of halls, was one of
the last three dorms to close
out in the men’s draw. Cowles
and the Norrises, traditionally
unpopular, were the other two.
However, girls were moreat—
tracted to Yourlker, and the
hall closed out much earlier
for them.

The letter expressed five
specific grievances. Two of
the problems cited must be
described as nomracial in
character, two are oldprobt
lcms that have been recog-
nized and dealt with, and only
one can be called a real and
current problem.

The two essentially non-rr ,
cial problems deal with line
cuts and the pool table. Linc
cuts are a problem that the
Dean of Students Office and
the Student Coordinator's Oft
fice has been trying to deal
with all year.

Last fall new line cut regus
lations were passed urging
every student to ask someone
cutting the line why and, if
the reason were not satisfact
tory, to ask him to go to the
end of the line.

The only legitimate reasons
for line cuts are a 12:30 lab
and a late sports practice.

Needless [0 say studentshave
been unwilling to challengeany
studentsﬁblack or While**al‘ld
so the problem continues.
Peer pressure is the only ef-
fective tool against linescults
ing; there is none.

If a student does not abide
by a student’s request to go
to the end of the line, he may
be taken to the allscampus
judicial counsel. This would
seem to be a logical step to
take with chronic offenders.

Anyone who is unwilling to
follow these steps listed here
have forfeited their right to
object.

The pool issue is another
nontracial one. Forum rogue

President’s 'Bill Of Righls’

to the SCARLET & BLACK,
Comment on “Model Bill of
Rights:”

We find many discouraging
implications in the ”Model
Bill of Rights” which Presi~
dent Leggett has recentlypres
sented. But for reasons of
space we will comment only
on some of our most serious
reservations.

The college has the “Right
and obligation net to take a
position, as an institution, in
electoral politics, or onpublic
issues, except on thoseissues
which directly affect its autor
nomy, the freedom ofits meme
here, its financial support,and
its academic functions." If
we are to assume that the ex
ceptions to this clause do not
in fact give the college the
freedom to take such positions
whenever it pleases, then we
point out that the college takes
politiml positions as a mat
ter of course: its position with
regard to blacks, the Urban
Studies Program, the can-
cellation of classes in resr
ponse to Martin Luther King

'Jr.'s assassination, for ex-
ample.

The ”financial support” exr
ception is clearly the most
problematical, for the very
nature of Grinnell’s financial
support and the class bias in
its recruitment policies cont
stitute a stand on a public
issue and has political implis
cations too evident to require
spelling out (the skeptical may
consult an excellent study by
Mr. chgett.--A.G.N.). And
the nature of Grinnell’s edur
cational structure and “aca—
demic functions" .constitutc
one of several possible and
established manners of edur
cation by, for example, 5017'
arating action from learning,
by departmentalizing "the
Search for truth." To an ims
portant extent a Grinncll cdut

cation determines how truth
will be pursued, the contentof
findings, and, consequently,
\vhat views will be deemed
“unpopular" or "controvers
Slal.H
These contradictions alone
make us less than ellIhuSIaS’
tic about the vow not to inter
fere with “any member’s
freedom to hear and to study
(these sorcallcd) unpopular
and controversial Views." But
moreover the teacher is ad-
vised of his ”responsibility
not to depart significantly frs
om his area of competence
or to divert significant time
to material extraneous to the
SUbJGCl of his course.” This
is in direct contradiction to
the "spirit of free inquiry,"
which, it seems, comes to a
dead halt at the edge of the
teacher’s discipline.
This implies that open curs
iosity will be branded as
amateurism, that curiosity
and investigation which cross
disciplinary boundaries are
to be discouraged, We ll‘lors
oughly believe that a teacher
of, say, literature cannot talk
for long without talking of pct
litics or psychology, that tea-
chers of literature, politics,
and psychology cannot talk
for long without talking olbio-
logy, anthropology, or philoV
sophy. We belicvc that “the
search for truth” must be in-
terdisciplinary, that teachers
should be encouraged (D be
Just as interdisciplinary as
students. The departmental
structure of lhc college, so
clcarly reinforced by the
"Model Bill," along with the
"positions" the college laC'
itly assumes, and the 110an
goncity of the faculty and stus
dent hotly arc in themselves a
kind of "institutional censor"
ship."

lotions call for students to
sign up by the half liour,with-
in two hours ofthc time they
wish to play. Students are re-
stricted from signingup witlnn
a reasonable period of time
since they last played.
Studentsuboth black and
white-manage to get around
these rules and dominate the
tables for two hours atatimc.
A pair of players will combine
their names for an hour and
add two fictitious names for
another hour.

Although players are sup-
posed to come to the Forum
Desk every half hour with the
txills to change activity cards,
they do net, as a rule, do so.
Those who man the desk are
aware of the shit likely to be
piled on top of them if they
demand strict adherence to the
rules, so they tend to look the
other way.

They have indicated a Will-
ingiiess, however, to enforce
the rules if complaints are
received. Therefore, ifsome’
one wants to play pool and he

sees that certain students are_

illegally occupying the table,
he should go to the desk and
lend support to the person
there as he tries to enforce
the rules.

If a number of students are
signed up to play pool-seven
if they'all happen to be black

one will just have to wait
his [Uri]. After all, everyone
has the same chance to sign
up.

The two problems whichhave
already been recognized and
dealt with are the television
and lounge problem and the
black prospectives weekend
problem.

Last fall there was a hall
meeting in Younker at which
Conney Kimbo presided. At
that meeting the television
problem was aired and thor-
oughly discussed. No prob
lems have surfaced since that

Peoples Peace

The People’s Peace Treaty
is a proposal drawn up last
year by students from the
National Student Association
of the United States and rep
resentatives of North Vleina'

mose, South Vietnamese and,

NLF students.

Introduction

Be it known that the Ameri-
can and Vietnamesepeoplearc
not enemies. The war is car
tied out in the name of the
people of the United States, but
without our consent. ltdes-
troys the land and the people
of Viet Nam. It drains Ameris
ca of her resources, heryouth
and her honor.

We hereby agree to end the
war on the followingterms; so
.that both peoples can live
under the joy of independence
and can devote themselves to
building a society based on
human cquali’tyand respect for
the earth. In rejecting the war
we also reject all forms of
racism tinddiscriminaiionags
ainst people based on color,
class, sex, national originand
ethnic grouping which form a
basis of the warpolicies, pre-
sent and past, of the United
States.

One More Time, Or A Free Game

by J. C. Lubowitz

I would like to take this op-
portunity to welcome two new
aspects of the Grinncll ex-
perience. They are from Iowa,
so the Admissions Office sh-
owered them with financial
aid to get them here. Theyare
Called ”Funland” and “Pad-
dock” of the Gottlieh family,
and they are currently in res
sidence in the Forum base-
ment. Yes, the pinball wizard
is at this momentsatiatinghis
appetite for the eroticism for
that essence of the technolo-
gical art, pinballs. Pinball
liberation has struck a blow
for the students of Grinnell,
and Funland and Paddock are
absorbing money 16 hours a
day.

This event has had profound
effects on Grinnell--psycho-
logical, sociological, econo-
mic and cosmic. Already,
glassy-eyed individuals, have
been drawn like somnambUs
lists from rooms and classes
to the Craven images in the
Forum basement. The poor
(literally) souls have foresa-
ken the revolution, Zen Buddt
hism, and psychedelies to
find life’s meaning in pinballs
and their bumps and chimes.

Treaty Planned

cipate in an immediate ceases
fire with U.S. forces, and will
enter discussions on the pro
cedure to guarantee the safety
of all withdrawing troops, and
to secure release of all mili-
tary prisoners.

AMERICANS pledge to stop
imposing Thieu, Ky and Khiem
on the people of Viet Nam in
order to ensure their right to
selftdetermination, and toens
sure that all political prisons
ers are released.

Vietnamese pledge to form a
provisional coalition governs
merit to organize democratic
elections, in which all South
Vietnamese can participate
freely without the presence
of any foreign troops, and to
enter discussions of proced~
ures to guarantee the safety
and political freedom of per-
sons who cooperated with eir
rher side in the war.
AMERICANS and VIETNA’
MESE agree to respect the int
dependence, peaceandneutrat
lity of Laos and Cambodia.

Upon these pomts of agree-
ment, we pledge to end the war
in Viet Nam. We will resolve
all other questions in mutual
respeCt for the rights of self
determination of the people of
Viet Nam and of the United
States.

\5 Americans ratifying this
agreement, we pledge to take
WhatcVCr actions are appropt
riate to implement the terms
of this Joint treaty of peace,
and to ensure its acceptance
by the government of the Unis
ted States.

 

The intricacies of the famed
double ﬂip and the agony of
a no-point ball are boggling
the minds. To paraphrase
Prof. James Magce, the pin'
balls will be a driving force
in communication between the
generations. 1 was amazed to
find Mr. Magee jumping up
and down when he heard pinn
balls were arriving. Rumor
has it that he useda guise of
academic inquiry to elude two
compatriots and was found
45 minutes later at the side of
Paddock, carressing antljigg-
ling in a most suggestive mans
ner.

Some notes on pinballs:

"Perhaps if we had hadpin-
balls on Saturday night, all of
those freaks would have been
entranced down in the Forum
and missed the Youngbloods
altogether.

--There is no truth to the
rumor that pinballs are
connected with the under-
world. However, the repair»
man who attended our broken
machines was overheard to
say, as he emptied the coins
box, "Mama mia, atsa spicy
pinball!" (Thanks to John
King of Stanford Law School,
from whose article I stole
that line).

"Congrats to Jim Dcmopo-
lis, who captured the first
free game in Paddock, and to
Mark (the Wizard) “alder
llaug(Sl1ver Spring, Md” flips
both), who held the record as
of Wednesday at 11,961 points.

In honor of the pinballs (pas
gan worship, as it were), I
hereby announce the first an-
nual 5&8 Pinball IMs, Each
contestant \villhavetwogames
on Paddock, and the highest
average will be declared the

coveted "pinball wizard" [rO’
phy. Allflipper fingered types
are eligible, even profs and
Mrs. Hawk. To cnter,put your
name and phone number in my
box (601) by Wednesday.

In COnCluSlOI‘l, let me dlS’
credit all the talk that the
Bureau of Narcotics will pubs
lish a report that pinballs are
really the first step to the
hard stuff. How long will it
be before someone is doingan
independent on pinballs?
