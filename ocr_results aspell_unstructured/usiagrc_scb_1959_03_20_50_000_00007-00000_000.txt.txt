Grinnell's baseball team is' talk

ling shape under the watchful;

cyc ot Coach John Plitsch,

H‘itsch sees a good year
ahead tor the Pioneers after
last season's poor 341 rec—
ord. His reasons include scvcn
rctiiriiiiig lettermen, a strong

crop ol sophomores, and tho
fact that only thrcc men were

lost through graduation last
year.

Letter-winners coming back
for another season include
catchers Gordie Young and Dick
Yaki, pitcher Dwight Nisscn,
first baseman Bud hoegge,

Shortstop Bill Murl y, lnflclder
Phil Spelt, and outfielder Pail]
Kantzler,

With tliosc scvcii seasoned
hands forming tho uuclciis' tor
his squad of scvcntccn. rtitsch
has sophomores Jim‘ Lowry,
Jack Mcycr, Dove Humphry,
Stove Resuick, Gory Knamil-
ler, Duane Krohnkc. Paul
Hockenstod, and Roger Sic-
mans.

Out of these
feels he can find two strong
infieldcrs and a good catcher.
This would allow Spelt to shiit
lo the outfield and Young could
also be ready for duty there In
Meyer Ptitsch has a sccond
pitcher to go with Nisscn, who
handled the burden practically
alone last year.

Another contributing factor
to last year's record was the
fact tllilt Murray and Kantzlcr
