Burglars hit
college-owned

houses

by Jill Petty ~

Two collegeowned houses were robbed
of over two thousand dollars worth of
valuables during Christmas\break. 1008
Park and 1130 East were probably broken
into between December 21 and January 9.
the day that. Director of Student Housing
Bob TownereLarsen and a buildings and
grounds employee were conducting a
routine repair and maintenance check oi
the campus houses.

Among the items taken irom both houses
were two guitar cases. a color television, a
stereo. African artifacts. and‘iewelry,

"Some of the doors had been kicked in.
shattering the woodwork. It looked like
they had [creed the back door on the east
side of the house on Park." said Towner-
Larsen,

Locked room doors atxllﬂb East had also
been kicked in. but Towner~Larsen did not
see signs of forced entry during his ins
vestigation.

Aaron Wolie, the student coordinator at
1130 East, said that the collective value oi
the stolen items irom his house was not
enough for students to make claims
against their parents homeowner in-
surance policies. TowneiuLarsen said that
the college policy on student loss resulting
iroin theit is printed in the Student Hand
book, and that the college accepts no finan-
cial responsibility.

Grinnell Police oiiicer Doug Shutts said
the therts are still under investigation. and
he believes that similarities between the
burgalaries indicate that one person is
responsible. “Similar methods oi entry
were used. Probably two or three people
were involved . , . I wouldn‘t Want to mess
with someone who could hit a 25-inch color
television by himseli " Shutts said that the
burglaries may also be connected with re-
cent break-ins in town,

speaker

by Dave Jones

Mario Cuomo. Democratic Governor of .

New York, will speak at this year's mm.
inencement on May 18. Cuomo, who is in
his second term as Governor, will receive
an honorary Doctor oi Laws degree at the
exercises.

Though his office has stated that the
Governor's trip will be non-political in
nature, the New York Times described
Cuomo’s recent announcement at a series
or speaking engagements as “a signal to
some political strategists that he is on the
verge oi seeking the 1958 Democratic
nomination tor president."

“It’s a little disheartening to have a
Democrat again as commencement
speaker. but it seems to be the trend . . . I
think it’s a sign of the narrowemindedness
oi the college," comments Professor Gene
Wubbels, Associate Professor Sheila Mc-
Carthy. a member of the college’s Ex-v
ecutive Council, which is ultimately
responsible for choosing the speaker,
disagrees. “I think there’s been good, even
distribution of the invitations for
speaker." she adds.

The Executive Council receives two
ranked lists of candidates ior commence-
ment speaker. one lrom a Iaculty commit

Elbert Morse Smith, 85, Professor

Mayilower Home in Grinnell on Saturday.

tee. the other from a student committee
composed of seniors. The two lists are then
evaluated by the Council with no further
student input and a final ranking of the
candidates is arrived at. In this Instance,
Cuomo, who had been the first choice of
the student committee, ended up as the Se-
cond choice for invitees. Alice Walker was
the lirst choice but declined the Invitation.

“‘We are glad that we have a prominent
speaker to make our commencement more
special," says Mike Harmon, a member of
the student committee that nominated the
candidates.

Although Cuomo's position as a major
Democratic figure could suggest a
political bias. many do not ieel that it will
make a difference “I really don't think it
matters who they pick as commencement
speaker, i just hope uiat Cuomo doesn’t
use Grinnell as a podium tore his 1988
Presidential campaign.” says Russ Mat-
teson. head oi the Campus Republicans.
Pruiessor Ira Strauber adds “I've always
thought that the proper iunction oi the
commencement speaker is to make the lite
tie box in Time or Newsweek . . . to get
Grinnell some attention."
