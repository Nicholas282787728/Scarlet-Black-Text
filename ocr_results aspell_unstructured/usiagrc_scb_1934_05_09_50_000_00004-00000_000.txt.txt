The interscholastie pole vault
mark was one of the few records
which was not apmoached Saturday.
The winner came barely within a
foot of the record of 11 feet, 5 s
inches held by Emory of North High,
Des Moines. Meanwhile Schiebel of
Davenport was vaulting almost two
inches over 12 feet at the Clinton
Gateway meet. and Eivens of Com-
ing was making 11 feet, 9 inches at

the orient relays.

A world's record was set at the
state college meet In years ago when
Brookins of Iowa ran the low hur-
dles in 23 seconds flat. The mark
still remains the state college rec-

,ord, though the world standard has

since been lowered. \

Now that the brown idlerby
drag is over, the college
shop believes that it would
be a pretty slick idea to an
nouncc the people who ran
as close seconds to the prize
winners. you of course
know the significance of the
awards, so just stop and
think the matter over and
see if the second team
couldn’t whip the varsity in
any battle of personalities.

here they are:

the biggest for doing the
least, you understand?

cated woman, oh mic mi.

in place of the doves it has
been decided to substitute an

serious person on the cam

he a. little difficult finding a.
really public-spirited couple
on the campus.
