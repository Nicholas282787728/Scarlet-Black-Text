In The Spring

Whenever new political regimes are in-
augurated, it is time for editorial columns
to renew their cnlsading efforts: It ls_not
that the old regimes go unappreClated; it is
just that the new have not yet lost their en-
thusiasm. They are still inspiredto give
their greatest efforts toward fulfilling cam-
paign promises.

There can be little doubt in student’s
minds that the testing system'at Grinnell
college is sadly in need of repair. A recent
editon'al in this paper pointed out how flag-
rant cheating has become during exams. If
we grant that the existence of such a prac—
tice is evil, we will agree that a remedy
must be secured

The first thing to observe is that the
“proctor” system is not beingenforoed rig-
idly enough to make cheating impossible, or
even difficult. Under this system _college
students are discouraged from accepting the
responsibilities of their age by being treated
as children. It fosters rather than defeats
cheating. » .

If our present system is deemed unsat~
isfactory in most degrees of enforcement,
the only alternative is some form of the
honor system. This method is the only one
\voithy of college level ability and intelli-
gence It places with the students the re-
sponsibility for its success or failure. It lex«
cuses the administration from any 01 icism
because of lax policing of exam rooms. It
actively encourages integrity in two ways:
by making the honest student‘personally
liable for the misdeeds of his cohorts and
by discouraging the cheater through in—
creased fear of getting caught, It is the
only system in which success depends en-
tirel‘y on student suppoit.

Our new Student Council president has

romised us a ballot on the honor systeml
Think well before you vote: _If you are W_lll-
ing to accept the responsibllity of enforcing
such a system, by all means vote “yes”.

Only in the beginning slush of. spring
does the average Grinnellian realize the
complexity with which his campus is ’lald
out. The maniac who devised the landscap-
ing of our little realm reached heights of
fiendishness when he sat down to compute
just where a sidewalk would do the least
good for the most pedestrians,

purposes of our argument, from Student
Union to ARH.

It is now too late in the year for any
good to come of a cry for SIDEWALKS. It
is also improbable that anyone in authority
remembers just how a sidewalk is colitrac‘
ted for or constructed All we can do is to
suggest that something be done about the
situation as it exists,

As for the hallowed, moldei'ing side-
walks that now lead Gi‘lnnellians nowhere
in particular, we say nothing. What could
we say? But of the myriad paths, by»ways,

warrens, and man-traps that Grinnellians,

have been using instead of sidewalks for
10 these many years, We have much to say:

By its Very nature, a cinder path is
all impermailent fixture. It tends to sink,
or to absorb water, or to scatter and dis-
appear, or to do all these things. Those
processes have taken place on Griniiell’s
cinder paths each year at this time, and
this year is no exception. And it‘s time,
they were counteracted. 1

So let's fill ’em up again. With gravel,‘
Cinders, macadam, old bones, old books,‘
new books, freshmen, or garbage — it
doesn’t much matter what is used — buti

By Pete nachos
To our new chief executive, a
a small bottle of as-
|pirin, and it vote of sympathy!
lInitiaLion took place at the last
SC meeting when President San-
ders got a taste of the parlia—
mentary red tape which, for some
reason, seems part of Grinncll
student government. Hope the
year proves entirely successful,
Frank, and that everyone will
help out as much as possible.

Looking ,back on the Sc elec-
tions for what we hope is the,
last time, there is one final item!
rd like to suggest. To be com-l
pletely successful, it seems to me
that the new prexy must con-,
sidor acting on the best platform
planks of his erstwhile “opposi-
tion" in order to achieve the
maximum in satisfying student
needs and wants.

To this end I suggest that
he put before the so Jim Gnde
iellt’s planks concerning public
, cation 01 so minutes; more (>0-
i operation between the top stu-
‘ dent leaders sud their oi-gsn-
nations; and o complete rec
View, through the people al»
ready investigating, of the p057
sibility of a small college radio
station. (\Vill have more dope
on the latter very soon.)

. Also to be considered might bcl
lthe instruction of stucent office—
,‘holders: posting of SC agenda
before each meeting; and a stu-
dent representative on the athlet»
1ic board, as suggested by .Ann
iacddan. All these and others, inn
eluding a drive to get more stu»
dents to attend sc meetings and
to make suggestions to their rep-
resentatives, if considered, will
