Campus Supper Club Premier
Planned ForNex’r Semes’rer

Initial planning for a campus supper club, to be opened
sometime during the second semester was dlsclosed today

by Merritt C. Ludwig,

vice president for administration.

Ludwig has invited Jo Lenz, Karen Halvorsen, Al Fitz and
Bob Norris to selve on an ad hoc student committee to

assist him in planning the
first meeting yesterday.

"Students and officials of the
college have recognized a need
in Grinnell for an attractive,
quiet, and sophisticated place
where dating couples can go
after a show, concert or game,”
Ludwig stated. “We hope a cam-
pus supper club will help meet
this need.”

Detailed planning has not
been done, but Ludwig out-
lined several ideas under con-
sideration. The club would be
operated on selected evenings
in the private dining room.
Food Would be served and en-
tertainment would be provid-
ed, both paid for by a single
cover charge. There would

also be music for dancing.

The club would be open to
couples only. Probably advance

club. The committee held its

 

reservations would be made
since the capacity of the club
would be limited.

,Like the Student Union grill,
the clllh would he a college-
operatell enterprise. However,
Ludwig said, the clientele
would he limited in students
only. Probably a. student
would he employed as head
waiter or manager with overall
responsibility for food, enta-
taiument, and service.

 

“In planning and operating a
club which serves the purposes
intended, we shall need con-
struetive ideas from all who
are interested. 1 hope students
will make their ideas known to
the student committee," Ludwig

concluded.

. . . And A Happy New Year!
