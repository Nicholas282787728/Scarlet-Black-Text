I-ﬂi original intent of this are
I ticle was to offer 5&8 ready
ers an update on the current
affairs of the Student Government
Association (SGA), but president
Onwuaehi informed us that due to the
diversity of SGA's protects, no single
cabinetmembcriincludingherself#
is in a positron to act as a spokesman
for SGA. We chose then, to ask Vice
PresidentDaveHatzfeldabouthis per
sonal thoughts on the present cabinet,
I-Iaizfeld pointed out that the
current cabinet is the best one in
years, in that it is a more cohesive,
efficient and reliable group, CONSISE
ing of members that Work close with
each other. “We have managed iocut
down on beaurocracy in the various
processes,“ he explained, “anti there
fore our work is more effective."
l-Iatzfeld pointed out thatSGA's
only problem right now is that some
ideas and proposals that look good on
paper prove unfeasiblc when they
come to orderly meetings. When
asked for an example he responded
thatthere are a couple ofsuch current
affairs, but the release of any infor-
mation about them—at this point—
could be detrimental to SGA’s cause.
We asked the VICC President

about SGA/studentrbody communi-
cation and he commented: “We have
a cabinctof doors, but we need more
positive feedback. The Student body
is both very reluctant to speak up, to
come talk to us and very apt to generr
alize concerning the issues of its me
terest. Last semester, in all commit-
tees and departments, I gotonty four
statements! And we hardly get any
response from the senators."

Weaskedhimthen,ifhethought
that the main stiidentinputnctwork—
the hall senators and their Iml'lulcsi
should be considered inefficient. ”It
is not as efficient as it could be," he
answered, “but maybe the student
apathy is high. Butin any case, this IS
a small enough college and there
shoulrln‘tbe aeommuilicatioti break-
down. In fact, I tell them to contact
me through Cenl'dll and I get at least
one message a week."

Our final question concerned ltn
evaluation 01 his overallperformance
as VP. He replied, “I succeeded so
far. However, there is always more to
do. I know there are problems out
there. that never reach me, so I can’t
do anything about them, but if one
student need doesn’t get here. then
there'soneteomany.Icanneverfecl
content and there IS never an end to
myjob. I am a servant of the student
body and I must and always serve
them. as long as I know their needs,"

H'E smell ofoilstillpersistsin

the breeze after a mistake in

plumbing lead to a spill of
310 to 320 gallons of number two
heating Oil on central campus last
Thursday night. Residean of Loose
Hall were forced to evacuate for a
short period.

Grinncll emergency services
responded to the call in short order,
sealing off the surounding area.
“When we heard that there was a gas
leak at the college, wejust thought,
‘oh, no!” said one fire fighter. Initial
reports lead firefighters to believe
that there was some sort of gas leak
insideot’thcdorms.Firefighters were
prepared for the worst.

“If this was a natural gas leak,”
said Fire Chief Gerry Barns, ”then
the whole side of the campus would
have been evacuated and we would
have set up ventilation for the catn-
pus and capped the leak.”

“It could have been a hell ofa lot
worse," said Facilities Management
Director Waldo Walker, “but the ace
tual danger to the campus was low,”

“That Stuff [heating oil] gets
going pretty good, but there is noth-
ing around here to burn and we have
snow all around," said Facilities
Management Associate Director Les
Ollingcr.

Firefighters checked to make
certain that fuel was not leaking into
the dorms through the heating tunnel
System. “We didn’t smell any gas,”

said one fire fighter, “but somebody
was cooking brownies in the base
merit [of Loose] and they sure did
smell good."

The spilt was first noted by Lane
guage AssistantStefanie Kruse, who
immediately reported theleaktoStu-
dent Adviser Tim Corkery. Corkery,
after a quick consultation with ex
studentstaff member Scott Ihrig, de-
cided to call 91].

“I thought the leak was on See
ond Floor," said Corkery, who pro-
ceeded to assist in the evacuation.

"This was the first time I was
ever ableto pullafirealarm forreal,"
said lhrig.

“Grinnell is listed as an tnterruptible

The tanks were installed two
years ago in order to bring Grinnell
into compliance wtth underground
storage tank regulations, but were
not tested until Thursday.

“The new tanks arealigned caste
