the best possible smoke: the

BOTH are much milder with an ex-
traordinarily good taste and, from'
the report of a well—known research

after-taste.

BOTH'ure exactly the some in ail re-

larger—contains considerably more of
the same tobaccos—enough more to
give you a 21% longer smoke, yet costs
Iinle more.
