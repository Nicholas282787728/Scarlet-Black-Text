at Forum

BY EMILY

Staff Writer

Concerregaing music lovers will
now be able re srarr rheir weekends
earlier rhan usual. lasr Friday marked
rhe premiere era new concerr series,
Live Lunch, which seeks re bring a
variery or musical aers ro rhe rorum
sourh lounge rrom noon ro one every
orhcr Friday. “1r is open ro every-
body," says SGA eonccrr commirree
member Holli Heerchelman ‘00, “it
is free, and ir is quite a relaxer arrer
grueling morning classes. Whywouid
anyone nor wanr ro Corrie?”

The idea for such a'concerr series
has exisred for many years. “Since I
have been a parr er Concerrs Com-
mirree, we have always kicked around
rhe idea ofhaving a concerrs series ar
rhe Forum," says SGA Conccrrs Com-
mirree chairperson Andrew
Errcnhofer ‘oo. “Originallyl rhink ir
was supposed ro be like a jazz club ar.
mosphcrc in rhc evenings. But rhe idea
was never realized or rermulared,"
This year, Errenhofer approached
Michael Sims, rhe Direcror errhe Fo-
rum, wirh die idea. Sims had previ-
ous experience wirh a lunchrime con.
ccrr series ar his former job in Arizona,
and ms open ro rhe idea. “So rhe idea
grew inro a lunehrimc series," says
Errenhorer.

The hrsr Live Lunch rearured fac—
ulry pianisr Eugene caub and violin-
isr Nancy McFarland caub, who per—
formed music from rheir beerhoven
Chamber Series lasr Friday. “The

Gaubs rumed ir inro an easy going,
cenversarion—likc atmosphere,” says
Hoerchelman, who is new in charge
or rhe series, “wirh Eugene always
making cracks abour how being mars
ried re rhe only orher member in rhe
chamber group somerimes causes fries
rion. . . . Nancy ar one point moved
herself and her music srand is {eer
away from rhe piano ro make rhe
whole rhing a lirrle more inrimare."
Throughour rheir performance, rhe
Gaubs provided commenrary and his-
rery orrhe music and composer, and
invircd rhc audience re inreracr and
look ever rhelr shoulders or rhe mu-
sic.

Eugene Caub was equally enrhu»
siasric regarding rhe ﬁrst Live Lunch
performance. “Everyone in rhc music
deparrmenrwas cxcircd when Andrew
Errcnhofcr came re a deparrmenr
meering recenrly and proposed rhis
Live Lunch series ar rhe Forum," says
Gaub. “The Forum lounge seems ro
be an ideal place ro play and hear
chamber music." Gaub believes rhar
more inrimarc venues such as rhe Fo—
rum ror conccrrs help re dispel com-
mon misundersrandings regarding
classical music being “boring" or “elit-
ist,” which he believes may come from
rhe Formal serrings in which classical
music is cusromarily performed.

Live Lunch plans ro incorporare a
mriery ermuslc inro rhe series, aswell

This Tuesday, Iowa City:

Feel like hearing a fantastic klezmer~tango—
indie rock band? Give Firewater a chance
and they’ll surely getyour feet a movin'. This
band, fueled by the insistent belief that one
can be both pleasant and ired at the same
time, never fails to intrigue, with their quintet
of saxophone, bass, guitar, violin, and drums.
And don't worry about having to consume al-
cohol: lead singer Tod A admits he’s never
even sampled Firewater before.
