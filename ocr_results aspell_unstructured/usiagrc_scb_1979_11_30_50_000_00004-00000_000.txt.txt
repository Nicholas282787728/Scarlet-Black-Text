keys Republican revival

by Wins/on Kreuler

Every Friday at 4:30 p.m., eight to
ten Grinnell College Republicans talk
politics during their meeting in the
Pub. .

The oldest political organization on
campus. the studentvrun group has
provided a means for students to
discuss their political ideas, and to
become active in political events,
Chairman Ted Vlamis commented
that the Grinnell College Republican
organization has three main purposes.
first, the group
wants to encourage
student discusswn
and the interchange

, of political ideas, se-
cond, provide a way
for interested
students to become
politically involved:
ﬁnally, the group
intends to aid in the
election of
Republican politi»
clans to public of-
rice.

Joan Altemus, an
active member of
the Grinnell College
Republicans and
campus coordinator
for George Bush,
feels the basic ad-
ministrative struc-
ture of the organiza»
tion is “very inforr
mal." The group's
meetings are held in the Pub every
Friday, and are open to all those who
are able to attend.

Currently, vlamis and other
members oi the club are working with
Republican students primarily at the
University or lowa and Drake Univer
sity to reorganize the loiva College
Republican Organization. Comprised
of college and university students
from all over the state, the organiza»
tion was iormed to promote
Republican ideologies and facilitate
crosscampus interaction, but has
been defunct [or several years, On
December 3, students from Various
colleges and universities will meet on
the Grinnell campus to draw up a con-
stitution and elect interim officers.

within the club, Republican students
are attempting to bring Republican
political speakers to campus, and to
organize a “full meeting" of all
Republican Grinnell students. A
Republican speaker such as Ronald
Reagan would be desirable to

"balance',’ the viSIt of Democratic
Senator Ted Kennedy. Also, a meeting
of all Grinnell's Republican students
would be beneficial to the activities of
the group because, presently, approx
imately half of the 20 known Grinnell
Republicans participate

Tentativcly, Vlamis stated that the
club is “trying to put together a panel
discussion on some sort of timely
issue ” Currently, no topic has been
set, tor the activity is still just an idea
for a second semester political hapr

pening.

Considering the upcoming presiden-
tial election. Altemus commented that
almost every student in the club has
"their own personal favorite " No
solid consensus among group
members exists.

in the past, the Grinnell College
Republicans have been an active
political organization on campus.
Though the club was dormant around
1974 and 1975, members have made up
for their inacthlty since then. The

most prominent example of their um»

comeback was the panel‘discussions last
year concerning the iuturo or me

Republican party, women and youth in
politics, and a keynote address by
Representative John Anderson. For
these reasons. Vlamis commented,
“ we have been the active political
organization on campus,"

Vlamls sees the Grinnell College
Republicans as a diverse political
group. when asked about the views or

politicians within the Grinnell
Republicans, he commented, “The
Republican party has people ranging
from JaVltZ and Anderson to Cr 9.”
(Presently, the former two polit 'ans
represent the more liberal iaction oi
the Republican party, while the latter
represents the conservative) Vlamis
went on to say that the diversity exs
hibited Within the Republican party is
contrary to the common misbellel that
the party represents a narrow political
viewpoint.

In fact, unlike the
Grinnell College
Democrats. he views
the lack of a solid
consensus among
the Grinnell College
Republicans as
“strength through
diversity." He fur
ther stated that
”part of the purpose
of the Club is to open

3 people's minds and
have discussions
which would not be
possible ii there
were no differences
in opinion " Vlamis
hopes that through
such an interchange
of opinions and

, ideas, people will

i grow and learn
more than if such
communication did
not occur.

Personally, Altemus is displeased
with the mistaken altitude many Grins
nell students exhibit toward
Republicans, She remarked, “Some
people on the campus tend to get a
disgusted look on their face when they
see a Republican. They picture some»
one in a three-piece suit in a cor-
nerl It never ceases to amaze me that
other people will outright reject us at
such a traditionally liberal school."
She added. “We are not thinking of
renaming the Grinnell College
Republicans the ‘Grinnell College
iasmsts' or the ‘Grinnell College
monarcllists!’ That’s Just a vicious
rumor started by some jealous
Democrats!" Considering the recently
formed Grinnell College Democrats,
Vlamis thought,“lt’s nice the
Democrats have finally gotten
together and done something "

On a final note, Altemus commented
“contrary to popular belief, there are
people in the Republican party who
can spell the word ‘regulatlon' without
coughing!”
