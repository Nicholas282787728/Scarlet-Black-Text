coverage at ‘
criminal arrests

Media coverage of criminal proceedings is a tenuous
process. The paper is responsibleto readers, to inform them of
events which affect the college community. The paper is also
obligated to protect the interests of the arrested suspect.
Unnecessary coverage, unsupported and unsubstantiated
evidence shall be regarded as unfit for print and needlessly
damaging to the student or students involved. This is the
policy of good iournalism.

The issue of what should and should not be printed was
raised once again due to a drug arrest in the city of Grinnell
during midsemester break. School was not in session, and
when classes resumed, the news was stale. Students involved
in the incident asked that their names not be printed in the
college paper. Due tothe circumstances of the arrest, we were
able to comply with the request.

5&5 editors, after conference, have decided that it would be
in the interest of the college community for the paper to
establish and print a policy concerning the coverage of
criminal arrests. Below is our statement:

The 5&h recognizes a difference in arrests made directly on
campus and those made off campus. The maior deciding
factor rests on the effect of the news on the student body, the
main criteria for iudging new stories. Those arrests made on
campus shall be printed, including the name of the person
arrested. The subsequent disposition is then a mandaroty
follow-up.

|n_the case of the offrcampus arrest, the name of the
arrestee, as well as the story, shall be withheld unless the
story has a valid effect on the student body and demands to be
printed. After the disposition is reached, the story, complete
with names, shall be printed as a matter of public record.

Things that go

bump 'in the dark

With the coming of early winter sunsets, students are forced
to a higher percentage of cross campus travel in the dark.
Traffic under these circumstances naturally becomes
rerouted from grassways to the sidewalks. Density on the
walkways in increased and heavy traffic patterns emerge
from the dorms to the libraries from the libraries to the forum
and from the PE. Complex to all points

Under normal circumstances this night travel would present
no problems. The situation this year is unusual. Street lights
have been removed from the intersection between ARH and
the forum. Lighting poles have been removed from other
maior pathways and some lights have remained in place but
not returned to working order. Students forced to travel these
routes must, at this time literally grope in the dark.

We would like to bring it to the attention of the Physical
Plant Director, Dale Hawn, that the present primitive conA
ditions are an inconvience to the students. Without lights,
cross campus travel could concievably be considered
dangerous, The staff has not yet received any reports of
collisions with night blind cyclists, but 5&8 staffers have
experienced uncomfortable rushes when passing unseen
strangers in the dark.

If the rationale for removal of the public lighting system is
energy conservation, we, of the 58.3, would like to contend th

If the rationale for removal of the public lighting system is
energy conservation, we, of the S&B, would like to contend
that our energy would be best saved elsewhere. Sacrifice of
public safety is too high a price to pay for loviIer lighting bills.
.We hope that other concerned students will support efforts to
return sale street lighting to our college campus.

remarkable in its diversity of
programming

The show I'm with is an hour

is a unique medium [or children’s
programming in that it is. unlike
television, aural and nonrvisual; it
leaves much to be imaginatively
and creatively filled by the mind.
CST uses the aural character of
radio to the lull extent to develop
listening skills, to expand the
imaginative faculty in children, to
benefit the blind, to help Children
respond creatively. In the future it.
will be aired twice daily, the first
slot aimed at ages 4-6 years, the
second to 6-12 years There will be
a further breakdown of the latter,
of H years and 842 years.

CST is a show of great variety,
varying from dayrlo and too

Haydn, have entrusted their most

synonymous with chamber music.

Aldrich: students not
strapped to system

To the Editor:
Re: Tom Simpson’s article,
“Students Strapped to the System"
(8&3, Nov, ii.

The apparent thesis of Mr.

because we do not have the
stamina to stand up to “the
system," as he so vaguely puts it.
lthe school? lhe society” the ad-
ministration?) and Lake the con

Simpon's article, as he states, is
“The ilaw of the system like this is
that each student is almost
necessarily stuck in a situation at
continual self-dissatisfaction."

If what. he says is trite, then we
as students should have more
control over what we do to attain
an education. The gist oi the ar-
licle, then, is control over one's
destiny—and it is here that I
disagree with his thesis

He gives examples of controlling
forces over one’s ilie: schedules,
others expectations, the “oven
bearing presence,” etc My point is
this; we have control over what we
do, and our satisfaction is
proportional to the degree lhut we
exercizc our irccdnm to act, To
stale ihat our schedules are not our

the stance oi "other people's ex-
pectations" assumes that the
course load demand is not. of his
own choosing. Again. my point
remains, I, [or one, am here
because I want to be here, To do
otherwise is to unjustly let others
control my actions. ,

However, l0 slate (ha! I do not

that i choose to partake in the
