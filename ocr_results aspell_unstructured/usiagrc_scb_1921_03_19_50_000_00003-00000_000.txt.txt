DRAMA MﬂNDAY NIGHT

Community Drama Expert to Talk
In chapel Under Auspiws
Lecture Course.

Prof. Frederick H. Koch, professor
of dramatic composition at the Unis
versity 0: South Carolina, will speak
in Herrick chapel Monday, March 21.
at 8:00 o'clock, on the subject of "The
Playmakers of the People." This is
3t regular lecture course number.

Professor Koch is a national figure
in connection with community drama
from college and university centers.
For several years he was at the Uhir
versity of North Dakota, where he or-
ganized “The Dakota Playmukers,"
who Wrote and produced plays und
pageants at the University. some of
the plays written by his students and
produced successfully, treated of the
life of the pioneers. Two of (he most
distinctive things done while he was
at North Dakota were a. tel‘cc’ntenttl'y
pageant coiled "Shakespeare, the
Playmakel‘," Written and produced by
his class in Dl‘ztlliittic Composition

and "A Pageant oi the Northwest" by
the same group. His students who
have gone out irom the University
have in turn established centers tor
community drama in their own and
neighboring states. Proressor Koch
shows through his talk, and pictures
thrown on the screen how his stu‘d-
cats have found material fnr drama
and pageantry in the history and tra-
ditions oI their own communities.

Concerning his work in North Da-

kutit, ”Walter Fritcharrl Eaton, one of
our best known dramatic critics.
writes: “I cannot but feel thnt here
(in theatrical eiperiments quite inde-
pendent of professional endeavor)
rather than in the present-day pro»
fessional stage lies the real hope tor
the theatre or this country."
Two or three years ago Ml‘. Koch
accepted o position as Professor oi
Dmmntic Literature at the University
of North Carolina Under his direc
tion his students are writing and pro
duclng plsys dealing with the tolk lite
of the South. His most recent comp
munity eitort consists of writing and
producing a terccntensry pageant oi
Raleigh, North Carolina, "Raleigh, the
Shepherd oi the Ocean.”

An article in the Review of Reviews
of September, 1919, summarizes well
his ideal and point of View:

"The Carolina Players or Chapel
Hill aim to translate the life or their
State into plays that spring irom the
life of the people, from the told of
North Carolina. They have built a
Play House as the homc tor their talk
drama, in the hope that it win ﬁnally

* become the institution of the coopera-

tive folk-arts. ‘ “ ‘ When every
community‘hus its Play»House and its
own native group 0! plays and pro-
ducers, we shall have a national
American Theatre that will give a
richly varied authentic expression at
American life. * ‘ * It is this
common vision, this collectivei striv-
ing, that determines nationalism and
remains throughout the ages; the one
and only touchstone oi: the Illture.”

Rabin "0011 at lierchcl

One of the largest cvents in Des‘
Moines' theatrical scnsnn is the com-
ing at “Robin Hood," the greatest ni
American comic operas, that written
by the celebrated Reginald De Koven,
nnd which underwent an elaborate res
vivnl at the Park Theater, New York
City. a short time ago. creating quite
a ful'ol'e in theatrical circles of that
city.

“Robin Hood” comes to the Berchel
Theater, Des Moines, Thursday, April
7, to play three nights and Saturday
matinee. .

This announcement by the Adams
Theaters Company will undoubtedly
be welcomed by every lover of big

an opportunity which comes rarely.
The present tour is a continuation of
the revival started at the Park Thea-
ter, and at every point ct its tour, it
is greeted by capacity houses.
”Robin Hood." it is generally cons
ceded, is by far the most distinctive
and interesting comic opera written
by an American. It is, very near
grand opera in the beauty of music.
but‘ being sung, spoken and enacted
in the plainest English, it possesses
intinite charm for all. While the lo-
oslc or the story is the beautiiul
countryside in the heart of England.
the treatment or the theme is purely ,
American, thus accounting for its ,
musical worth and bristling humor.

“'Robin Hood” reveals some ﬁrettyl
escapades of thnt merry bandit and!
outlaw, taking one back to the dElYSl
when the Sherwood forests or England
were tun or jolly bandits, who robbed
only the rich, and between escapades,
sang, danced and drank “Brown 0c—
tobcr Ale." The piece was produced
bnyalDll Dunbar, the wellknown DUF-
VeYOl‘ Of musmhl entertainment, with
the assistance and COVOPel’lelOn Of the
composer, this project being the most
notable ll} the last year Of ltll'. De
Koven's life. The leading SODI‘aDO
role is in the hands of Elsa Thiede.
while the principal baritone role is
taken by Robert Robertson, one or the
greatest of American baritones, ac-
cording to metropolitan presses.
Jessie Bartlett Davis plays the role of
“Alan~A»Dale.” ‘Vllh these famous
singers and an exceptionally ﬁne
chorus, “Robin Hood' should be a disc
tinct delight.

DESTINY ~

 

HE air is composed of molecules.
bombard you from all ’Sldes.

They Constantly
A thousand taps by a

thousand knuckles will close a barn door. t The taps
as a whole constitute a push. So the constant bombardment
of the air molecules constitutes a push. At sea-level the air
molecules push against every square inch of you with a
total pressure of nearly ﬁfteen pounds.

Pressure, then, is merely a matter of bombarding mole-
cules.

When you boil water you make its molecules ﬂy off.
The water molecules collide with the air molecules. It takes
a higher temperature to boil water at sea- level than on Pike’s
Peak. Why? Because there are more bombarding molecules
at sea- -1eve1—more pressure.

Take away all the air pressure and you have a perfect
vacuum. A perfect vacuum has never been created. In the
best vacuum obtainable there are Still over two billion mole-

' cules of air per cubic centimeter, or about as many aS there
are people on the whole earth.

Heat‘a substance in a vacuum and you may discover

properties not revealed under ordinary pressure.

A new

ﬁeld for scientiﬁc exploration is opened.

Into this ﬁeld the Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company have penetrated. Thus one of the chem—
ists in the Research Laboratories studied the disintegration
of heated metals in highly exhausted bulbs. What happened
to the glowing ﬁlament of a lamp, for example? The glass
blackened. But: why? He discovered that the metal dis-
tilled in the vacuum depositing on the glaSS.

This was research in pure science— research in what:
may be called the Chemistry and physics of high vacua. It
was undertaken to answer a question. It: ended in the dis-
covery of a method of ﬁlling lamp bulbs with an inert gas

under pressure so that the ﬁlament would not evaporate so

readily. Thus the efﬁcient gas—ﬁlled lamp of today grew out
of a purely Scientiﬁc inquiry.

So, unforeseen, practical beneﬁts often result when
research is broadly applied.
