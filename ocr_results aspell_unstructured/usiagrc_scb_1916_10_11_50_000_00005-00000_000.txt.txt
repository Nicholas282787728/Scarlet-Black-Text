That the [amiliar words, “ lVUiIﬂS
can he proved by the Biblc, are true
it one knows how to manipulate the
tcxt, was for ibly brought out lw Dr.
Douglas in his address at l'cspc Sun-
day on “The Luxury 0! Ll'Hn,

“How can you know tlit: limit) or
linug," continucd Dr. Dougla. ‘
or us want to lead a life at Dmer‘ty.
You can't conic into it by selfishness
or by lcading a detached lil(‘. You can
come into it by fellowship with a Iai’gi
cr trio and Christian lorc."

“Practical attachmcnt to the great
Christian entcrprise," said Di. Dolg’
las in conclusion, “is thc only way in-
to the luxury of living. My best
wishes are that you might say, ‘I nev»
or knew the luxury of ii in; until I

camc into partnership with God!"

Two numbers, "sing Praise" and
“Tarry u‘ith ‘ ," from the oratorio
“Death and Resurrection oi Christ,"
by Professor Schevo, were a feature or
‘the Service.

Macy has not been out in a suit all

nish better protection than the old
