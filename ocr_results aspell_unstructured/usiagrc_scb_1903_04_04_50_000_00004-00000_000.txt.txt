JOHN A. HOESON LECTURES.
Last evening at the college
chapel, a body of students and
citizens were treated to a lecture
by the economist. Jiio. A. iiuo
son.

iris address began on relations
between capital and labor. Labor
unions governed by wise councils
will not demand in wages
when manufactured commodities
Mutual self
harrnony be-

rise

are falling in value.
interests produce
tween employers and employees.
This, of course, is not always true
in all trades and businesses where
location, nature and large amount
of capital afford facilities [or
tarniing monopolies which,
through selﬁshness, dominate
prices both in commodities and
labor.

He considered capital and labor
as very similar. Laoor poolsto
eontrolthelabor marketand capi-
tal fuses to strengthen its produc-
ing capacity, the latterbeing the
more complete.

Mr. Hobson believed that the
ﬁnal method of settling industrial
disputes lay in the strongest
organization of capital and of
labor, and that organization is
conducive ot peace and produces
astronger tendency toward Con-
ciliation and amicable settlements
which would be kept by both
parties. The public is not pre~
pared to allow capital and labor
to ﬁght out their quarrels when
public interests are deeply con-
cerned. Private concerns then
cannot justly complain when the
public interferes with their private
contracts. The question or values
and wages is distinctly social.

Mr Hobson is a thorough
Englishman, and a recognized
authority on economics. He
spoke to a large and attentive
audience.

CHRESToiELLIS JolNT MEET-
ING.

dela vocal solo and responded

fashioned kind. Several former
