As a result of the action of the
board atareccnt meeting there will
be more schools than usual in the
state meet this year. The new ones
include Cornell, -Morningside, Coe,
Des Memes and Simpson Who at their
own requests were extended iiiyita-
tions. They will Add to the interest
of the mesh mainly in the individual
events uuri in that they may together
take enough points from some of the
larger schools to change the result
materially. It will he remembered
that Morningslde is the school which
beat both Drake and Grinuell out of
their places in the Big Four last [0.11.

At Chicago and Purdue several
pigskin chimera have appeared at the

indulgingin spring practice. We miSv
trust if any of these enthusiasts would
be caught wearing minds and straw
hats in March. That Would be rush-
ing the season.

Buy aseason ticket ior the spring
athletic events. See what an im-
mense amount at entertainment you
get for three dollars and then call to
mind theinoreased amount you will
get tor the same money under the

semester fee,
