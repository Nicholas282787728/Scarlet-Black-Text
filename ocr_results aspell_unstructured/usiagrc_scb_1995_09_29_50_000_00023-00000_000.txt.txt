Specifically, a bill which is be-
ing kicked around the capital (has
already passed the Senate and House
and has only to be bashed out a little
between the two) changing many
aspects of our welfare system. De»
pending on the outcome of negotia—
tions between the two houses, some
of the more severe changes include:
cutting aid for teenage mothers com—
pletely, and not giVing aid to chil—
dren of mothers already on welfare.
The important changes that have
already passed include an end to the
federal mandate for as5istance to all
families that quality under existing
poverty guidelines, and a shift ofthe
control otvveltare away from tlie fedr
eml government to states by giving
states block grants which they choose
how to spend. An important thing
to realize is that the welfare budget is
a small fraction of the entire federal
budget, as opposed to [items like] the
military budget.

lrenlize that we are allvery busy
here; 1 can only tune in occasionally
to the world outside, but when I
recently did I began to worry. So
Miles and I decided to see if anyone
else was upset about the direction
that these bills seem to indicate for
ourfuture Wearethinkingoftrying
to organize people, tnaybe informa—
tion sessions, a [eﬂclieil’L a forum of
some kind, to see ivhat people are
thinking, and to give people some»
thing to tlunlt about, If you are
feeling frustrated, or interested, or
have ideas about thingstliatwe could
do, please vax us Sam [coleman] or

In the Coffee?

BY DAN BUE’I'I‘NER

Grinnell College never ceases
to amaze me. I was reading the
Grinnell Herald—Register the other
day, and discovered that the college
expects to raise $75 million for the
renovations of Goodnow and Bo—
wen, for the construction of the new
Fine Arts Center, and for various
other purposes, including student
scholarships and grants to alumni.

This, inandofitself, is not amaz—
ing; they’ve already raised $443 mt —
lion, and lhave no doubt in my mind
they’ll get the rest. I also highly
approve of the renovations. Goods
now is a beautiful and historic build—
ing, and, since 35% ofGrmnellgrad—
untesareseienee mayors, Bowencould
use a little more breathing room,
(Whether 35% of Grinnell gradu»
ntes should be seienee majors is an
other matter entirely.)

What amazes me is how this
college doesn’t really seem to pay
attention to where its money is got
ing, or rather where it isn’t going.

There are no plans to include a
photographic darkroom in this new
bullding,or[oaddcourses lnpholuge
raphy to the curriculum.

There are no plans to hire more
professors to reduce the size of the

more popular classes on campus.

There are no plans to renovate
or replace the student publications
building where the heat rims on hot
days and theaitconditioning runs on
cold days.

There are no plans to add cours»
es on multiculturalism to the curric—
ulum.

There are no plans to provide
many of the studentotgeinlzationson
campus with separate offices and
meeting places.

There are a host of things this
college could spend some of that $75
million on that would benefit a good
segment of the campus population
The article 1 read in the Herald—
Registersaysthat“theremaining$45
million will be applied toward schol—
arships, faculty, teaching enhance—
ments, support ofthe alumni Volun»
teer efforts and a reserve ‘for con-
tinuing ﬂexibility and innovation.m

Some of the things I would like
to see include:

Broadening tlie horizons of the
Art Department to include more stu-
dio art courses, including photogra-
phy. As is, the department seeming—
ly refuses to recognize photography
as a legitimate form of art, and forces
art majors to bulk up in art history
rather than studio art because of the
dearth ofstudio courses.

Many of the intro courses here
have over 30 students in them, and
some have as many as 60 or 70. Afar
cry from the faculty—student ratio of
1:10 listed in the 1995-96 Course
Catalog. ln point of fact, I've never
had a class with fewer than a dozen
students in it. Hiring more faculty
would not only reduce class size, but
‘it would also allow more sections and
a greater selection of courses.

Spending more money on stu—
dent publications would greatly im—
prove their quality; after all, they are
a direct reflection of the student body,
and, therefore, ofthe college. And it
isn’t simply that all of the publica
tion editors would like to get paid
more and worry about money less;
there are some things we would like
to do, and a lot of things we honestly
need to have, that we simply cannot
afford under the current financing
system.

With all of the debate last year
over multiculturalism at Grinnell,
and considering how little has been
done to change the situation, adding
some courses on the topic would ben-
efit everyone. I'm not saying that we
need something like ‘Multicultural—
ism 101: How to Accept and Get
Along with Almost Anyone’ to be
taken wrth tutorialﬁmther, some—
thing akin to the interim sessions the
college is offering this year on the
history of Grinnell College. I think
that there would be a lot of interest in
something like that.

Many of the student organiza—
tions here are crammed into shared
offices, lounges, or tlie nearest avail-
able free space. as witnessed by the
Letter to the Editor from the Space
Committee last week. When the
Forum was built, that’s what the cur—

rent SGA offices were supposed to
provide, and what Stonewall pro—
vides now. But times change; there is
no longer enough space for the di»
verse set of student groups we have
now.

I would also dearly love to see
this college give out more financial
aid. 1 do not mean more to each ofus;
I mean more to the people who need
it. A number of my acquaintances
have been unable to continue their
education here because of mickey
mouse things like income-bracket
changes. One was a straightrA stu—
dent whose parents worked overtime

Commentary - 11

to send here here fot her freshman
year. When the time came to pay for
her sophomore year, the extra mon—
ey her parents earned was counted
against them, and she couldn’t come
back.

I'm sure that the new Fine Arts
Center will be a vast improvement
on the old, both aesthetically—could
it be worselvand functionally, but
at the same time I don’t think that it
is going to be all it could be. As for
the other things I’ve talked about,
they are issues which I hope the ad
ministration will act on in the near
future. None of these suggestions are

simply things I pulled off the top of
my head; all of them are topics on
which I have had, at some time or
another, long discussions with other
students and with faculty members.

I really believe that these are
things the school would be well-ad
vised to spend its money on; they
would expand and enhance the aca»
demic side of the college, and they
would do the same for life outside of
class.

In other words, they would be a
a lot more beneficial than ninning
around bottling up ‘SQC HZO.’
