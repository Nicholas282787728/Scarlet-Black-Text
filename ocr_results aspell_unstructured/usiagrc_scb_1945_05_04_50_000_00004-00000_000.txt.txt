Intramural

By Jean Kiefer

The intramural program looks
like a three ring circus at this
point. What with badminton,
ping-pong, softball, and maybe
golf, complicated by little things
like homework and exams and
stuff, the future looks rosy a
with a slightly greenish cast.

Doris Popple, Haines senior,
defeated Peggy Tregillus, Read
sophomore, in badminton finals,
to cop top honors in that tour-
nament, but badminton doubles
hav‘en't progressed to the finals
yet.

Popple is in the running for
the pi «pong championship, too.
The deciding game can't be play-
ed until the other finalist is de-
termined.

The softball rounderobin starts
ed off wdl when James won its
first game from Mears, with a
score of 13-10, Tuesday night.
It's hard to guess what will hap-
pen“ in the softball tournament
thiswspring, From looking over
the record of past teams of the-
cottages, we can safely predict
that Read will have a softball
team that combines skill and co-
ordination. Cleveland will come»
across with a bunch of hard
players that show spunk and
energy. l

Halnes and James probably willl
have teams about on a par,
Main- will be weak, but have

usual erratic performance.

At any event, this tournament
pmmises to show some stiffly
contested games, with a lot of
homers and spectacular plays,

one phase of the intramural
program a'seems to lack inte’rtst.
That is the golf tournament. Any
students who are taking golf in
class, or who find time to go
out to the ‘course Just for an af-
ternoon of pleasure. should save
their best scores on nine holes
and turn them into their cottage
intramural chairman.

Unless .more students are in»
terested enough in this to take
part, the golf tournament will
have to be cancelled; so come on
kids, turn over those devastating
scores to your intramural chair-
men and drum up some competi-
tion.

'Phys. Ed, at Grinnell is the
healthy little sprite whose ac-
quaintance has changed girls in-l

at swimming, circus performers
at tumbling and leisurely languid
damsels in the restricted work
and relaxation class.‘ 1
There’s almost nothing the little 1
sprite won’t do for you if you'll
let her. She'll lure you away
'rom your studious cloister at
12:15 or 4:15 or maybe 10 or 11,
she'll make you stiff, she'll show
lyou the town on hikes, she’ll even
wash your hair in swimming.
Phys, Ed. comes in many dis-
guises. In fall she's hockey, ten-
nis, golf, archery or speedball.
In winter she scurries indoors and
becomes tumbling, basketball, vol—
leyball, badminton, fencing and
recreational and modern dancing.
When spring comes she takes
on the same appearance as in
fall and also is softball. Swim»
ming and conditioning, her two
favorite garbs, are kept all year.
