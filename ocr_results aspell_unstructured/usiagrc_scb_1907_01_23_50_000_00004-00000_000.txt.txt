oonsent of students in order to get n
higherenx levied in order to pay on
some ancient debts and the plan will
propaliiy be adopted again nero your.
I am heartily in iavor of its”

honour w. CLAolL.

”I have tWO objections to the plan.

150. I don’t believe that it is a. good
plan toiucrease the tuition as such
which is already the highesn in the
state. Our tuition may be low as
compared with schools of equal rank
but I don’t think it wise to increase
the total amount of the tuition. Put
the {92 as a separate item by itself.

ﬁnd. The semester free (1095 not
carry out the idea of taxation of all
according to their ability to pay The
present plan taxes everyone accord-
ing to their uhility to pay. The new
System taxes everyone as if they were
all on an equality ﬁnancially. Every
college activity is supported acocldr
lug t0 the interest the Students have
in it and increased interest cannot be
amused by the fee.”

ARTHUR C. iicGrLL, ‘08.
L The tuition idea. is mentioned

in a. remark in another column.
2. The present system does not tax
awarding t0 the ability of the

student, to pay. It does not, tax at
all, but even i( it were so regarded it
is not a proportional assessment no-
cause some who have less means sup-
port these activities more liberally
than those who have moraiEditor.

“Two of my leasnns ior favoring the
plan are, that many whoere able and
should attend but at present do not,
would do so. It would bring to runny
the advantages which they do not or,
present appreciate. It would better
the social life of the school providing
all the women would consider it pro-
per [0 use their own cards when at-
tending an eveno with the men. The
same principle applies in the case 01
classportles when euch member of
the class pays his or her own dues.
This may seem too radical n departure
trorn oustom to many, but. 1 thinlr it
would resultln heneiitror the green
majority. The successlul working
out oi this plnn would require no
solutely the cooperation of the entire
school and would grenhly help to
develop a. social life which at present
is looking".

L. A. How; ‘09.

Some more sentiments which have
been expressed on the social side of

the question Will be published in the
next issue.
