Women’ 5 tennis: lots of l9ve _

isv BROCK WEBB

The Grinnell womens tennis team has two reasons
to celebrate this week. The Pioneers defeated Simpson
College and Loras college with backstorback games
on Friday, Sept. 2 and Saturday, Sept. 3.Through their
hard work and preparation, they emerged victorious,
with a closer bond as a team and as friends.

The philosophy ofthc team lies in the bonds that
they share, both on and off the court. Coach Barb
Waite feels that without a strong bond of friendship,
the team would not be as strong. “One of our objec
tives is to have a very close team, but a very competir
tive team,"waitc said. “The team is really doing well
with this.They're really keeping each other shaip and
still having a good time."

This team spirit plays a major role in the success of
the team.Although the women had a short preseason,
with only three practices before their first match, they
already have fastrgtowmg friendships. “We have
team dinners," Margaret Block 08 explained “Out on
the courts, we are always mixing it up, never playing
with the same people The unity within the team is
essential to succeed in tennis. Even though tennis is
a very individualistic sport, it is crucial to have a tight
team,” said Camila Alarcoanordon ’08. “This helps
everyone trust each other and feel comfortable in the

Bath Loras and Simpson were tough teams to
beat. The Pioneers did not play against them last
year, which made this a first experience for many of
the players. These two games were the first ofﬁcial

matches- against conference teams, which reﬂects the
cohesion and skill of the team. “Iowa conference
teams are usually tougher," Waite said. “We won [the
matches] solidly. It is a great confidence builder for
going into our Cornell match, one of our toughest
matches of the season."

The success of the team comes from all levels and
all classes. This year, the tennis team is fairly young.
The majority ofthe team made up offirst and second
years. “The returning players are showing good lead-
ership. The new players are coming in with a lot of
energy and enthusiasm," said Waite. The two groups
compete with each other pushing each other to the
Limit, keeping a constant pressure to play better and
move faster. “[The pressure] needs to go both ways,
and I am looking for that to continue. If it does, it
won’t matter whether we win or lose," said Waite. “We
will have a great season."

The Pioneers are optimistic about their upcom-
ing game against Cornell College. “as our chance to
show a nationally mnked team that we are a serious
competitor,"said Rachel Engh '08. Grinnell and Core
nell have a friendly rivalry, which will make for an
exciting match. “We have a strong team this year and
I am sure each one ofus are going to give the best we
have and try our best to win," said Shwcta Khajutia
’07.

As the women prepares for their match, one thing
is certain: they are a tight—knit group in an individual
sport, a team of friends who trust each other both on
and off the court.

Football heartbreak against Ripon

BY MARISA WHiTLEv

The women’s soccer team officially kicked offits season last week
With a pair ofnon-conterciicc matches'l‘he Pioneers’first game on
Sept. 1 was a loss against Loras College, one of last year's second
round NCAA playoff finalists. Their second game was the alumni
match on Sept. 4.

- Although the game against Loras on Thursday was a non-con»
fercncc match, the team was very focused and competitive for both
halves. The Pioneers ultimately fell to Loras with a finial score of
173.

Loras scored twice during the first half, but the Pioneers never
let up. A corner kick by Soﬁa Skraba ’08 in the 52nd minute ofregnir
larion was headed by Julia Bradley-Cook ’06 and fumbled by the
goalie, which led to a goal by Rachel Moskowitz ’05. This brought
Grinnell to within one goal ofLoms, late in the game.

The Pioneers had control of the ball and they were on the offenr
sive for the majority of the second half. The game became progres-
sively rougher during the sccond halfand there were a few question-
able fouls called on both teams. However, the Pioneers stayed in
control and played a good game.

Loras scored the final goal of the match during the last three
minutes ofregulatiou, clinching their victory over the Pioneers.

The game against Loras was valuable preparation for the up
coming conference games. When asked about the upcoming match
against Cornell, goalie Liz carrier '07 said, “We have to keep our

It was another typical Grinnell
vs. Ripon football game last Saturday
in Wisconsin; two rival schools went
head to head and victory was decided
by seconds on the clock. The Pioneers
picked up right where they left off last
year in terms of exciting, fourth quarr
ter comebacks and lastrm‘mute chances
at victoryThe Red Hawks of Ripon
came out on top this time, slipping past
Giinncll with a score of20r18.

“We were pleased with the way we
finished the game,"said offenswe cooi-
dinatorleff Pedersen, “but it’s tough to
come so close and not get the win."The
Grinliell offense did come close and res
ally broke through late in the game.

The scoring started in the first
quarter as Bud Baiimgartner '07 got
the Pioneers on the board with a Zor

yard field goal. Ripon answered in
the second quarter with a oneryard
touchdown run by tailback Bill 01m.
Grinnell then got a little help from the
Ripon punt team, when they snapped
the ball into and out of their own end
zone for a safety. However, another Rir
pon rushing touchdown made the score
145 at halftime.

After halftime, the Griiinell defense
came out refreshed and held the Red
Hawk offense to six points. Leo Mate
tin Y06 led the way with 13 tackles and
a sack. Qiartcrback Scan Pfalzer '07
got the Grinncll offcnsc rolling, find-
ing Ramiro Carrillo ’07 {or a six-yard
touchdown and Kyle Perry '08 for a
23-yard touchdown. Perry's touch
down catch, capping a 9lryartl tlrive
late in the fourth quarrel, made the
Scott: 20718.Thc Pioneers then went

for two, attempting to tie the game, but
failed.The score remained 20718 as the
clock ran out.

Grinnell played very well on both
sides of the football. Pfalzcr ﬁnished
the game 19 of 33 for 258 yards and
two touchdowns. He also rushed 12
times for a total of 16 yards. Lance
Biirkholdcr ’08 led Grinnell in n|SlIT
ing with 65 yards on 15 carries. Perry
caught five pa-scs for 107 yards and
Brock Martin ’08 also had five re-
ceptions for 52 yards.The defense held
their own during the second halfwith
Martin’s 13 tackles and Franklin Gilmr
ore-Merton grabbing 10 tackles,

"I think we did a bettei job stopping
the run in the second half and really had
a chance to win the game,"said Martin.
“The option offense they ran was pretty
hard to stop because they had so many

communication good, play more to feet, and ush the ball fonmrd.
Just like we did in the second half [with Loras .”The women's soccer
team has already become very close and they are looking forward to
the upcoming conference games. “We have always had a very close
knit team," said Moskowira, “The first years have really integrated
quicldy and I think we are all feeling good about it.

The Pioneers came away With a victory at the alumni game last
Sunday. The women’s soccer team defeated the alumni team 3 0.
The alumni game is very popular with former Grinnell soccer play-
ers. Some ofthc alumni on the women's team this year came from as
far back as the class of’97.

The alumni put together a very strong team and although it
wasn‘t a conference match, much like the Loras game, the competi-
tion was very real.

The alumni game is always taken very seriously, even though it is
mostly played “for bragging rights"according to Rebecca Mackenzie
’09. Mackenzie broke a toe during the match when a member of the
alumni team stepped on her foot, dramatically proving her point.

This year’s alumni match highlighted the strong underclassmen
presence on the team.The first two goals of the game were scored
by first years Gabi Mldonado Bell and Katherine Ni.The final goal
was scored by Julie Ault‘OS.

The Pioneers are looking forward to beginning their 2005 cone
fetence season. The women‘s soccer team will be defending their
2004 Midwest Conference tournament tide.

different options to choose from.”

Although a loss in such a close game
is always hard, the Pioneers were not
discouraged. "I feel that we could have
done better, but I know we will step up
and continue to get better as the weeks
go on,"said Martin.

Grinncll will have a chance to even
their record at home when they play
against Lake Forest on Sept. 10. Gl‘ln-
nell's offense and defense will look to
have two strong halves and control the
tempo ofthe glint:

“We hate it completely different
game plan for Lake Forest," said Mar-
tin, “because unlike Ripon, they are
mostly a passing roaml think we need
to have a solid week of practice to for
tits on our pass coverage and become
iiiontally tough to in order to come out
with a win.
