Back in 1380-81 Radcliﬂe college offered its students a course
in astronomy . . . a radical departure for women in those days.
then, as now, Radetme had no laculty cl its own but used the
services of Harvard's faculty. The picture below shows the
limits at women's activities in the days when textbooks and
plates rounded out the course. Contiast this with the photo at
lelt ol Ygerne Gaetz, who is locusing the 24~inclt pltotOv
graphic telescope at Oak Ridge station ot Harvard university,

Women‘s keen sight, sensitive fingers, and patience have
helped to make many important discoveries in the astronomi-
cal lield. Students who major in astronomy are a small, rather
clannish, and enthusiastic group. A great many continue in
teaching or research alter graduation,- a great many also marry
but since they very olten marry astronomers, marriage does
not mean the end of their astronomical work.

Stone ldel Gets 80": Coat of Paint

The Rev. Dr. J. M, W. Farmham, a graduate at Union college, presented his alma mater
with a massive stone idol in 1860. For16 years it rested under a shed. In 1876 Dr. Fum-
ham gave notice that he was returning so the idol was hastily set up on the campus.
Students gave it a liberal coat ol paint beiare his return, have been painting it ever since.
This year the lreshmen had some paint left over so they daubed a large ‘44 on the side-
walk in lrcnt ol the chapel. Sophomores heard of the trick, forced the fresh, at paddle-
point, to scrub it off. - Collzsutv Dlsul Photos by Ann.
