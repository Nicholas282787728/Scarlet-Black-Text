with no regular track workouts be-
ing held during the past two weeks,
Coach Lester Duke is coasting with
’his squad until the opening of the
outdoor season. The first meet or the
season, the home meet April 13,
promises to be hotly contested. To
complete arrangements for the class
‘Leams, Coach Duke has named class
captains. Thomas will load the
freshmen: Hensley will head the
sophomores, Greene the juniors and
ingi-am the seniors.

The freshmen have Thomas. Beall,
Gerhardt, Pye and McClung as point
winners in the Crinncll meet, Doug-
las, Edwards. Hensley, Miner, Kukb-
litch and G012 are the best bets for
-the sophomores. the juniors will rely
on Mark relietier and Greene while
McKee, McCully. Beck, ingram, Le—
gorc, Risser. Wyatt and Wenger will
step for the seniors, It has not yet
been announced whether Taylor will
run as a sophomore or as a junior.

Schedule Incluili-s nuals'

Weather permitting. all varsity
men are expected to workout at home
during spring vocation and to report
ready for hard work the day school
starts. Grinnell has one of the
hardest track schedules it has ever
boasted, including seven meets on

>consecutive Saturdays to keep the
men interested, There will be two
dual meets in Crinnell.

Crinnell will meet some faster
competition outdoors than was met
on the indoor track, but is expected
to make a good showing. The outr
door squad will be augmented by Art
Risser, a distance man, Robert Der
long, reputed to be a good half-miler,
Burt Murray in the discus, George
‘Kelly, a local boy who is somewhat
of s sprinter and dash man find key
mond Peterson, s qllnrleramiler.

Spring :l'lrill Begins

Beginning spring track workouts
Monday. Coach Lester Duke put his
squad through light drills Monday
and Tuesday preparing for the out
door season which opens in the home
meet April 13, The cindsrmen did
little more than limher up,

Aside from the weight events,
where Grinnell has given little conr
petition this year, the Pioneers pre-
sent a well-rounded squad. A relay
team which is champion of the is»
souri Valley and of the Central con-
ference is perhaps the strongest of
Coach Duke's performers.

McKee, quarter—inner, and Taylor,
hurdler and broadinmper, arc per-
haps the outstanding individual per—
formers. With Greene, Captain Mc-
Cully and Hensley are are best in the
field events.

Final Battle Of .
Tourney Tonight

Soph (Jo-eds to Clash With Juniors
In Championship Game.

Rand gymnasium will be the scene
of a championship basketball battle
tonight am o‘clock when the sophOr
mores clash with the junior team in
the final game of the women's inter-
class competition. Both teams have
been hitherto undcfcated this season.

The sophomores have won their
other tournament games by large
scores to the Junior scxtct. The ups
pcrclossmen, also undefeated. have
have maintained a clean and consiSr
teat game throughout the season, and
are expected to exhibit a good brand
of ball tonight. '

Feature entertainment in connec-
tion with the game is being arranged
for the large crowd expected to \vitr
ness the decisive contest. A small
admission charge wrll be made for
the benefit or the \Vomen’s Honor G
society.

Soplts Bout Preps

The sophomores took a last 41712
victory from the freshman sextet in
one oi the sneediest battles of the
women's intcrclass tournament Mon-
day night at Rand gym. The score
is no indication of the quality of the
competition, as the preps uttered a
game tight and annoyed the sopho—
mores considerably durlng the iii-st
half.

The soplls were slow in starting,
and close guarding on the part of
the irosh maintained a low score
during thc first period. The half
ended 13—6 with the sophomores in
the lead.

In the second hair the sophomores
broke loose on a scoring spree and
left the trash well behind. The soplio~
more machine functioned perfectly
during the last part of the game.

house chairman and the members of
the house council has been set for

an announcement made by Russell
smith, secretary of thc Council of
House chairmen, This date falls on
the first Monday after spring vac.—
tion.

Every man in the building except
the seniors will be eligible in voting

for the house chairmanship must be
men trom the junior class who will
be seniors next year.

In the case of the house council
clections all men are eligible for votr
ing and candidates must be either-
sophomores or juniors this year. The
theory behind this ruling is that the
governing body or the building
should be composed or juniors and
seniors.

Newly elccted house chairmen and

once under the existing plan, al-
though the old group will remain as
an advisory body the remainder of
thc term.

The elections on April 3 will mark
the beginning of the second year for

ment. The present house unit plan

cnts working in co-operation with

tion. According to members of the
Council of house chairmcn the plan
has proved highly successful and its
continuance is recommended.

interesting exhibits in the several
fields of chemistry taken up in the
laboratory attracted about two hun-
dred spectators to the open-house
conducted last Monday night by
chemistry students in Blnir hall. Both
students and town residents attend-
ed the exhibition.

in the organic laboratory there
were displays of food products, per»
fumes, many organic compounds
used as medicines. and a distillation
or crude oil similar to that used in
rciming processes. The preparation
of carbon dioxide snow at a tempera
turc of 130 degrees below zero was
very interesting.

Many processes oi analysis were
demonstrated on the second floor of
the laboratory. The weighing of
n as was the feature of that de-
partment. Members or the beginning
classes etched glass, liberatcd oxygen
and chlorine, demonstrated electrol-
ysis, prcparcd a chemical garden,
and blew glass.

Two shows of the industrial pro—

LAST LECTURE YESTERDAY

Summarizes Eirperimenls Leading

To Present Knowledge of
Biology Structures.

“\Ve have set out to discover the
factors controlling organic form; we
haven't discovered them but we have
clminiated many possible thcorics."
Dr. H. W. Rand.- Harvard exchange
lecturer, stated Tuesday in Conclud—
ing his serics of talks, His subject
was “Internal Factors in Develop-
ment.”

“Experimental embryology has
proved that organisms are not liter-
ally prciormcd, that form is determ-
ined inside the protoplasm and not
by the outside world, and that form
depends not on the granular pig-
mented contents of the cell but on
the intimate structure of the proto—
plasm itself." .

Dr. Rand summarized the experi-
ments that have attempted to deter-
mine whether the organism is com-
pletely patterned in minature in the
germ material, or whether it is form-
ed by progressive combination of the
elements present: and whether the
parts of an organism are dependent
on each other to develop, or whether
they are self-differentiating.

Roux studios Embryo

The idea of miniature preformation
was backed up by Roux’s experi-
ments with frog embryos. Roux kill-
ed one 0! the cells in the two-celled
stage with a hot needle, and found
that the remaining cell developed as
a normal half-embryo. soon the
damaged side was replaced, giving a
complete embryo; but Roux consid-
ered that this was merely comparable
to regeneration of parts in adults.
and “stoutly maintained that there
was complete internal preformation."

Observes Sea Urchin

Research on cell lineage seemed to
substatniate Roux‘s belief. in differ-
ent embryos, corresponding cells al-
ways went into the corresponding
places in beautiful order.

Then came proof for the other side,
against minute preformation. Driesch
separated the two cells of a young
urchn embryo in calcium-free water.
and then returned them to calcium
water to develop. Each cell develop-
ed as a normal sea urchin. but one-
halt size. When a four-cell embryo
was similarly treated, each cell grew
into a perfectly normal embryo,
hut onefourth in size. "This was a
very surprising development," Dr.
Rand stated. "We had supposed that
an egg mcant an animal, but an egg
could mean two, four, or eight ani-
mals. This blasted the Mosaic theory
of minute predetciniination,"

Studies Interdependence

Roux‘s experiment was then 're-
peated, by sucking out the proto-
plasm of one cell with a microscopic
pipct. instead or just damaging the
ccll with a hot needle. The rcmain-
