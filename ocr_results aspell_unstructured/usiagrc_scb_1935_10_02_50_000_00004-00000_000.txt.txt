A CULTURAL NEED

The recent changes iii the men’s dining
room have been brought about ill all effort
first, to provide better service, and second, to
develop better manners on the plirt of the men
in the dining hall and indirectly make the cul-
tural advantages of Grilinell more real.

The second reason for the changes is a
serious matter. It practically amounts to a
confession that Grinliell men are not as well
bred, according to the accepted standards 0F
good breeding, or if they are, they delight ill
hiding the fact. How else can the careless
table manners be explained? '

Each college is expected to give its stu-
dents cultural advantages, and none is more
important than a strict lliailitcllallce of good
manners, “'llif‘l] develop poise and ability to
feel at home in ally kind of society. Gl'lllllell
offers this cultural development, and a splen-
did opportunity to practice it in the meii’
ing hall, hilt such has not been the or so.

The exercise of good manners is the mark
of a gentlcinnn. They brand one wherever he
goes and slovelily practices, such as have been
displayed in the dining room recently, are lilie-
]y to cause trouble iil later years. Good mane
licrs, especially at the talllc, have never failed
to pay dividends. '

The new dining room regulations have
been placed in effect to develop this cultural
side of college life, hilt whether it is developer]
remains to be seen. However, it is certain that
nothing call he achieved without cooperation
on the part of the men. Gi-iliiiell is a cultural
school, hilt it is up to the men of Griiiilcll to
take advantage of this fact. To best do this,

FORCED PATRiOTISM

From Lynn, Mass, comes a rather pcre

however, would violate the truancy law of the
state.

The problem confronting the school au~
thorities is how to enforce the flag saluting
law, Without violating the truancy law.

Other Opinions

YOUTH CONDEMNED
(University Daily liiuisnli)

In a recent issue of Harper‘s monthly, Pearl
Buck, noted author or several bestselling books on
the people and customs of China, politely calls col-
lege students spoiled brats. In her opinion we are
sadly lacking in the “knowledge of life, of its depths
and its heights, of the follies and the weaknesses of
men and women, to which we are all liable, as well
as of their glories and strengths, which are possible
for any soul resolute enough to achieve them.”

It is just barely possrhle that Mrs. Buck. haw:
ing lived so long in China, thinks like a Chiiiamau.
Bewailing the fact that we are spineless creatures
and unworthy of rebellion so door to her fighting
heart, the article, although containing a few or
gressive gems of wisdom comes dangerously close
to being a farce.

No doubt Mrs. Buck is speaking of the repre»
sentative college student, as she sees him No doubt
she has been all over the country and become ac-
quainted with some American students _.Bnl is her
acquaintance broad enough to warrant her conclii»
siUris?

Look around over our campus: Does life and
living seem to he handed to the representative stu-
dent on the proverbial platter? Isn't it true that
the large majority of students are fighting for an
education by.partially and many times wholly sup-
porting themselves? Can it be called rebellion when
we refuse to accept our environment and fight for
an education? It is unfortunate that Mrs. Buck
fails to take the typical college student up for her
minute scrutiny, Her conclusions and statements
would have been very much different had she taken
the trouble to become acquainted with typical stu-
dents. rather than the altogether too evident super-
ficial examination evinced by her article.

Youth stands condemned by her; it is hoped
for her own sake, that the qualities that have made
her a discerning reader of thc emotions ot‘ the
Chinese peasants, will not continue to elude her.

Collegiate World

 

Business men, speaking before
groups of future Rotarians, tap
their fingers and remark, “Ah,
yes, no young man could better
occupy himself during these <ch
pression years than by going to
college." ‘

And a thousand college presi-
dents, with onc eye on the school
account hooks, agree entllusias~
lically. In fact, if more young
men and women with money to
spend don’t agree with thcni this
year, another batch of small col—
leges are due to wipe the black-
board: free from chalk and cell it
a day. Ten colleges closed within
Lhe last couple of years, while sev.
cral others consolidated.

others are putting up a strong
light to save themselves. The
methods they have used in this
fight are just now coming into the
open, thanks to an investigation
by thc Association of American
collages.

The Turck report shows that
American schools of higher learne
ing have amazingly degraded
themsclves in the frantic competi-
tion for students. Says the report-
cr, “The business world has had
few practices in unethical competie
tion that cannot be matched some-

Colleges offer ”scholarships” lav-
ishly, which are, in reality, only
out and out grants-in-aid and have
no merit basis. one man esti-
mates that out of 200,000 fresh-
men last year, only 15 per cent
paid all expenses. Unscrupulous
high school principals make deals
with the colleges, whereby they
provide two paying students to
every scholarship. Alumni get
commissions on each high school
graduate they drag into the fold of
Alma Mater.

And the frame of mind of the
students themselves who are thus
escorted through college? Says an
investigator: “Flattered by many
proposals and at last bribed, they
act as if they owned the campus.
Professors find them critical, de-
nianding, unsympathetic". And, of
course, a student who had entered
a college at the earnest request of
prexy himself, would find it mighty

Nine Weeks

was the privilege this summer of
Miss Edith A. stei-nfeld, assistant
professor of design and painting.
She spent nine weeks studying at
Goose Rocks Beach, Me,

The class, composed of about 40
students from all parts of the
country. studied Mr. O'Hara‘s
technique in landscape painting
through field trips and lectures.
“The country around Goose Rocks
Beach is well adapted to Mr.
O’Hara‘s style,” Miss Sternfeld
said. She also spent some time
in the White Mountains.

An exhibit of Mr.
watercolors was shown in the
quadrangle last spring. Miss
stemfeld described the artist as a
very colorful pcrsonaiity. “He is
a scientifically minded person, bce
