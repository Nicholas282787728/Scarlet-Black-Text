Doe: the GOP '

have a future?

by Andre“ Schultz

The Elephant and the Donkcy
are endangered schIes on the
American Political scene. Will
they soon become extinct7 And will
the Grand Old Party, now
celebrating its 125th anniversary,
be the first to go?

Experts and observers have
diverse opinions on the subject ol
the decay of the two-party system,
and on the decline of the GOP in
particular, Some have already
written the Republicans off, \vhilc
others think the Republicans have
considerable staying power if they
respond properly to the electorate
in the next iew years,

ONE SUGGESTION offered to
help save the party, and an idea
that will be discussed at next
Wednesday’s Republican con-
lerence, is that the GOP should
broaden its base oi support.

“Broadening the base is an
idea used consistently and con-
stantly in Republican circles,"
said Gregg Edwards, president of
(Human College Republicans.

EDWARDS SAID there are two
possibilities for eliciting greater
support for the GOP. One strategy
is to attract elements away from
the New Deal Coalition. Speakers
at next week's conference Will
address the issues ot attracting
blacks, women. and union mem-
bers to the Republican Party.

A second strategy is to scrap
attempts at minority and special
interest group appeal and work on
expanding its existing white,
middlesclass base. Edwards said
the middle class makes up the
largest part of the voting
population and it is this “silent
majority” that the GOP has lost
touch with. '

:\ MAJOR OBSTACLE exists to
the Republican Party's plans of
either broadening or expanding its
base. This obstacle is the threat of
a takeover of the party by the
ultra»conservative element. Ed-
wards reterred to this element as
the “New Rightists,”

He said such men as Ronald
Reagan, John Connolly and Jesse
Helms are “dangerous people,”
adding their supporteis are the
most active and vocal in the party

 

and they are creating a struggle
[or control ol the party

TIIESIC NEW RIGII'I’IS t are

regarded as threatening by 13th3

wards and by the moderate
elements in the GOP because of
their “corporate” soctal vision. 0n
the one hand, having a Teddy
Kennedy for President would lead
tlle country into soc‘ l'stic statel
\vellarism, Edwards aid. But on

the other hand, a New Rightist

President like Ronald Reagan

would lead the country into a

system cescontrollcd by govern

ment and big business. Columnist

Michael Novak has termed such a

state the “corporate bureau

cracy.”

IN EITHER CASE, Edwards
sees a failure in the expr ssion or
Republican principles which are
most clearly articulated by GOP
stalwart Claire Booth Luce. She
says the GOP stands for “political
and economic freedom, for liberty
of the individual, for a lrce~market

or fiscal and financial
responsibility in government, and
tor limited government."

Ideally, Edwards sees the GOP
applying the principle oi limited
government in decentrallzing
institutions. Social and public
service should be controlled locally
as much as is possible, he said.
“What needs to be done Should be
done by governments closest to the
people."

ON THE SUBJECT of
presidential politics, Edwards said
the Republican Party still has a
good chance at regaining the White
House dos ite erosion at the grass
roots He as doubtiul, however, or
the GOP'S chances |n1980 ”I don't
know that anybody can beat
Carter," he said.

But. Edwards added, a New
Rightist candidate like Ronald
Reagan “would never win an
election for president in this
country.” He said in order to win a
national election the party would
have to field a moderate candidate
who would be appealing to the
middle class majority,

Faculty abolishes Skip Day

by Andrew Schultz
The iaculty passed a resolution
last Monday abolishing Skip Day,
the once-a-semester holiday which
has had iaculty approval since
1974
The vote was 48723 with [our
abstentions. The resolution is ef-
fective immediately, so there will
be no faculty approved Skip Day

this semester. _
THE MOTION TO abolish Skip

Day was carried over from the
December «a faculty meeting when
a motion to abolish the [811

Spring convocation proposed

by Nancy Gould
The Curriculum Committee made three proposals

THE SECOND
would be intensi

FOCUS of the convocation week
ve advising, including underclass

to the Curriculum Council regarding a change in

course distribution, the establishment of a
weekdong Spring Convocation and a recommended
general education program.

The committee’s proposal would require students
to have at least 12 credit hours from the
Humanities, Social Studies and Science divisions.
Currently, students cannot mke more than 48
credits in one departmentor 92 in one division.

Another proposal would be the establishment of a
Spring Convocation, a week set aside for general
education of the campus community and advising of

underclass Students.
THE THIRD PROPOSAL asks that a “desirable

general education program" be recommended but
not required.

ACCORDING TO THE committees proposal, me
convocation would consist of two parts, The first
function would be to create a “schedule at lectures,
panels, and seminars” on an issue of general
concern to the campus. _ . .

pre-registration for the following semester.

In addition to preregistration, all students would
be required to write short essays: Underclass
students whorhad not decided on a major would
prepare a “short essay evaluating the goals and
direction of their experience at Grinnell.” Juniors
and sophomores who had declared a major would
write an essay outlining the expectations they had
in their major fields and would also write on
”general education and the connections between
these expectations and their post-BA. directions."

Seniors would write a “retrospective essay on
their college experience."

Jones said the convocation week would possibly
change Grinnell‘s academic calendar. “School may
run another four or five days,” he said.

Jones added the possibility of shortening either
winter or spring break may be considered in order
to accomodate convocation week.

semester Skip Day was amended
to include the spring Skip Day.

SGA PRESIDENT Greg Youtz
was allowed to speak to the faculty
as a student representative. Youtz
said he believed students were
generally in favor of keeping Skip
Day the way it has been. “There
seems to be strong student support
for it,” he said.

vourz SAID Skip Day serves as
a healdiy relief of tension from
academic pressure.

“It seems unioi'tunate to (SGAl
that professors take meir own
courses so seriously that they
cannot give up one day in their
schedules," he said. Youtz con
cluded by saying he feared the
consequences of an abolition of
Skip Day. Students would have
their Skip Day regardless of
faculty action and “some
professors would go out oi their
way to punish the participants," he
said.

PROFESSOR IRVING Fishman,
chairman of die biology depart-
ment said he was disturbed by the
threatening nature at the debate.
“I regret the tone this issue has
taken on."

Fishman and fellow biology
professor Diane Robertson argued
Skip Day is particularly harmful to
the laboratory courses, These
courses could be seriously setback
by the loss of even one day, they
said.

Fishman also questioned the
assumption that Skip Day is a Valid
tradition at Grinnell. “It’s no more
a tradition than the Boarshead
Dinner or parity raids were at
Grinnell. The loss of Skip Day

 

wouldn't bother me one Whit,” he
said.

But Fishman also acknowledged
the probability that Skip Days
would continue despite faculty
action to the contrary He said he
would then have to adjust his
schedule to deal with an inevitable
Skip Day, “That certainly doesn’t
give me a problem” he Said. “I’ll
just have to talk a little faster."

Ron Kurtz, chairman ot the
iaculty, opened the debate, calling
Skip Day “a benign tradition.” He
saidit was a useful event and “it is
not a bad idea to have that kind of
break."

Kurtz -went on to outline the
discussion he had with SGA
President Greg Youtz and Dean
Waldo Walker Jan. 3 at which time
a compromise proposal dealing
with “the technical problems that
upset prolessors” had been
suggested.

UNDER THE TERMS of the
compromise, professors would be
notified of the week in which Skip
Day would occur in a semester so
that they could adjust their courses
accordingly. The compromise also
would have promised more ex-
tensive coordination with facility
and administration concerning
potential conﬂicts a particular
date might have.

Kurt: said at the meeting Skip
Day might continue to exist even it
the vote abolished it. ”I hate to
imagine scenarios," he said. “but
there will be Skip Days whether we
vote them out of not.”

”I'M IN FAVOR of Skip Day,"
Kurtz said.
