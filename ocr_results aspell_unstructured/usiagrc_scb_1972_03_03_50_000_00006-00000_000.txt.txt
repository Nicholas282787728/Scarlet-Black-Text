decision. He said that the departr
ment’s decision against Nasser was
because of Nasser's past inconsis-
tency which made future estimates
of his performance impossible.

Worley said "the whole problem"
was that he could not make any pro-
jections regarding Nasser's iuture
performance as a teacher and mem-
ber of the academic Community in
the college,

The inconsistency, according to
Nasser, was a result in large part
of his “educational experiments",
some of which he admitted had been
failures. In light of these Iailures
Nasser said he had ”adjusted his
procedures”. But, Nasser said, It

Nasser said student opiilion on his
recontractiug had not been adequater
ly consulted, comparing the secrecy
of Executive Council proceedings to
government secrecy, and using the
Pentagon papers as ananalogy. Both
he and David Abel Said it was ex-
tremely hard for faculty or students
to get a clear idea ofwhatprocedures
are within the Executive Council.

Nasser's comments inaugurated a
discussion of what tlle student role
should be in determining educational
policy. When it became clear that
the topic was no longer the specilics
ol Nasser's contract, Worley ei—
cused liilnself lrom the meeting and
did not return Nasser, however, rer
mained throughout the proceedings.

Nasser’s right to be present and
speak at a Student meeting was chal-
lenged at one point, but a vote on
whether he should stay was decided
in his lover.

ture, Ihe student coordinator intro—

they favored ”more direct forms at

Lounge.

They shortly returned to the main

gan over whether to adopt something
similar to the Meyer proposal or to
use direct confrontation tactics,
such as occupation of Burling. From
then until 12:00 the meeting occu—

There was liItle real enthusiasm
for occupying the library, and the
proposal to do so never really got

people they were trying to win over,

Greg Curoil, an Executive Council
member who was, he said “speaking
only Tor myself," observed that ii
the library were occupied, “a large
number” at those present “will be
expelled.”

“The college has been pushed,”
said Guru“, “and eventually it will
stop being pushed ll

With the library occupation becom-
ing increasingly less viable, debate
turned to the Meyer proposal itself.

The chief objections to Meyer's
proposal centered around its leaving
the final decision witll the Executive
Council while offering no guarantees
or safeguards that the Executive
Council would reflect any of the
lower echelon recommendations that
would come up to it through the
EPC’s.

Repeatedly the queinon was raised
as to Whether the Executive Council
could be trusted to consider student
opinion,

Several amendments were offered
to modify this part of the proposal.
These were combined and condensed
into the single amendment that, at

11:45 , was many adopted. The
Meyer proposal itsell was then
passed and will be subnlitted to the
faculty at an early but unspecitied
date. Another meeting was set tor
a p in Thursday ill the south lounge.
The other two members ol the de-
partment who participated in the
decision on Nasser had been invited
to the meeting but hail declined to
come on grounds ol protessional
ethics, as had the administration.

ol the meeting paralleled for the

Task Forces To
Consider Issues

Over two-hundred people packed
Main Lounge last night to continue
discussion of the problems of slur
dent power, with special emphasis
on Instructor Alan G. Nasser's lirr
ing. .

Most of the meeting was a dis-
cussion oi the rehiring of Mr. Nas-
ser. The first poinI of the contro-
versial meeting was marked by
heated discussion which was reflect-
ed in demands to change chairman
twice during the night.

Three task forces, chaired by Rob
Rainer, Kay Sopharand Jenna Finch,
will be formed to deal with the three
proposals on the circulated sheet,
During the meeting there was little
discussion oi the last two proposals,
which dealt with the broader issues
oi student power ‘ Debate on these
points was ruled out oi order.

The proposals were that students
should have an equal voice with
faculty on department Educational

Policy Committees and that stu-
dents should have a voice in some
Executive Council decisions,

Halfway through the meeting a vote
oi the students present indicated that
all who voted but three were in
lavor oi rehiring Nasser. Sever
ral students clearly pointed out
that this was not an endorsement
of “direct action" such as the oc-
cupation ot the Library

Discussion ranged lrcm Nasser’s
unique Contribution to the social and
academic communities at Grinnell,
to the Validity oi the student body
deciding about Specific faculty
personnel issues. A major point
of contention was Whether the para-
mount issue should be the immediate
rehiring ol Nasser, using any means
to achieve that end, or wehther the
structure which caused him to be
Iired should be changed ﬁrst,

The philosophy Department EPC
has agreed to reconsider the case,
including input trom Nasser's phi-
losophy and social studies students.
including in their report input lrom
Nasser’s philosophy and social slur
dies students. Kay Sopher pointed
out that under the present system
this would probably make no dif-
ierence since Ihe Executive Council
has already considered student on-
inion in favor DI Nasser. She had
talked with Mr Morries, a member
of the Executive Council who indi-
cated that it would take a change
