IT'S PLAYOFF TIME!

Final
Conference

Forget midsems, iorget the SGA elec
tron, iorget the Small Town Symposium;
the second specialrinterest basketball
season begins this week. The NHL plays EU
games to eliminate five teams; the NBA
plays 82 games to eliminate five teams;
the 5.1. league plays eight games to
eliminate 13 of the 21 teams. The two best
of each conierenee and two at-large bids
comprise the elite eight.

The “Big 10” title was decided on the
last day of the season as a standing-roomy
only crowd estimated at close to 45 viewed
Men ot Pause as they upset MS, 60757.
The experienced PMS team lost their com-
posure and a 13-point lead in the final iive
minutes of this Big 10 battle royale. Not in-
timidated by the overvaggressive play oi
PMS, the Men of Pause outrmuscled PMS
for crucial baskets during crunch time. On
the strength oi this win, Men or Pause cap»
tured the first seed in the '87 3.1, tournar
merit. PMS, finishing number two in the
Big 10, will get the second seed, The ACC
race finished in a threerway tie for first as
AIDS, the Fother Muckers, and the Pink
Flamingos, all posted 5-1 conference
records. Tie-breaking procedures were
stretched to the limit, as AIDS had beaten
the Fother Muckers, who had beaten the
Pink Flamingos, who in turn had defeated
AIDS. League commissmners have lived
in fear of this arrangement for centuries.
The S I. commissioner decided that he had
more important things to worry about, so
he didn't name a champion and all three
teams will go to the tournament. The Big
East was a comparatively simple matter
as Omar and ﬁle Pharaohs clinched the
Crown with a 64) conference record.
GSMAS, whose only loss was to the
Pharaohs, earned the second Big East spot
In the tournamentr

With NCAA-like wisdom, it has been
decided to change the rules for the
playoris. Since the games will be played on
the Center Court of Darby, the three-point
shot will be added. This, along with the
larger court, should benefit the more
guard-Oriented teams such as GSMAS,
Men of Pause, and Downtown Beirut.
Downtown Beirut benefited also from the
rather involved 5.1. tie-breaking pro-
cedure, The militia-men found themselves
among the three teams with 5-3 records,

all bickering over the last at-large tourney
bid. The tie-breaking process involved
beer-chugging, bribery, and records
against common opponents, Downtown
Beirut shelled the Calluses, who aced the
Fuzzy Balls, and thus, by the law of tran-
sitivity, ls better than both 573 teams. The
seedings for the tournament, which begins
on Monday, are:
