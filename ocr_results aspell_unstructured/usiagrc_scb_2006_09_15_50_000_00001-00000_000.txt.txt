Women’s cross country team wins, men take second at home meet

3v CHLOE MORVL AND DAVID H. MONTGOMERY

The cross country teams at Grinncll are famous—or infﬂm0u57
for poster‘ campaigns promising anything from “noise c(l)ocks" to
the chance to be the “life parrner"of team member Erin Sindewald
'08.All these await the student who comes to “The Duke."The many
Grinnellians who rode down to the Oakland Acres GolfCourse last
Saturday may or may not have had those promises fulfilled, but they
found something else rewarding: dominant performances from both
the men and women’s teams.

Running just a few minutes from the college, the Pioneers
matched strides with nationally ninked Warthurg. The women’s
team won the meet while the men placed second. Grinnell also had
the rastest time in each race, with Sarah Spencer ’08 winning the
women's six-kilometer race for the second consecutive year in 22:20.
Drake Ballew’09 covered the men’s eight kilometers in 25:49.

Ten other colleges sent teams to the meet, in addition to a team
of Grinnell Alumni known as "Updog" that ﬁnished just behind the
Grinnell mcn.

Ballew was running in the middle of a big pack for the first
several miles ofthe race,“Around the third or fourth niile,l thought
I could maybe win," Ballew said, “I knew I could win with about a
mile left. I had a lot or gas left in the tankirclativcly speaking, or
course," he added with a laugh. “I was able to put a pretty good mars
gin in between me and [second-place Adam Wolrotwitrthurgj,"

Women's cross country coach Evelyn Freeman said that the team
always looks forward to Les Duke, “The Duke is great because the
entire team can rtm together," Freeman said. “Being able to iun in

front orparenrs and the student body is a great opporrunity."

A shuttle ran back and forth to campus every half hour so stu-
dents and parents could easily get to the golf course. At the course
itself, spectators hustled to cut across the course to keep tabs on
friends and classmates.

And there were plenty of Grinnellians cheering on the Fiat
neers. In an inter-team tradition, members of the men's swim team
showed up dressed in swimsuits to cheer on the Grinnell runners
Their chcsts were painted to spell out “Go Roos," the nickname of
the men's team

“The runners usually go out and support the swimmers,“ said
swimmer Nate Wittnam '09 “It's a great bond between two differ-
ent sports."

For runner Tim Hcderman '10, the meet was exciting because
of the success of the team around him, "I was really excited be-
eaiise i came from an incredibly lackluster program back at my high
school,” Hedcrman said. “To have the opportunity to come into a
team that is so well established was just outstanding. We did really
great, it’s only going to get better from here."

Cross-country team scoring is based on the total places of the
top rive runners on each team, with lower scores better. The Pioneer
women rook three of the top four places and five of the top 12
for 31 points, 23 points ahead orWartbiitg. Behind Spencer, sara
Brady '07 took third, Allison Louthan ’08 placed fourth, followed by
Katie Ryan ’07 and Becky Bessinger"09 in 11th and 12th.

The men had 60 points behind Ballew and sivth place finishei

In the town or Grinnell, everyone knows Danny
Carroll. Some Grlnnell professors take their children
to his pumpkin raim eveiy Halloween, and Carroll is
landlord to several Grinnell students. He is also a Re-
publican political heavyweight who has represented
Iowa House District 75 for 12 years, half as assistant
majority leader. Two years ago, however, Democratic
political newcomer Eric Palmer came within 280
votes ofunscating Carroll, Coming up this Nov, 7, it’s
time for a rematch.

But this is more than a race for a single seat; this
is a race for control of the Iowa House ofRepresenta»
tives Currently, Republicans control the House 51-
49. If Carroll is unseated, the Democrats could take
over the Iowa General Assembly for the first time in
14 years. The race has drawn national :t!tention,with
potential presidential candidates such as former Senat
torlohn Edwards (DVNC) and SenatorJohn McCain
(RrAZ) coming to support their parties,

With the election expected to be close, the votes
of Grinnell students are expected to be important.
The Campus Democrats plan a major push to regly
tcr outrofrstllte students to vote in Iowa to bolster the
political fortunes of candidates like Palmer, and that
does not sit well with Carroll and area Republicans.
In the last election, Grinnell students were criticized
iii a Republican party mailing suppoiting Carioll.

The Iowa Republican Party distributed a mail-
ing in the district that asked voters to make sure that
“1,000 eastrcoast liberal kids" at Gtirmell College
wouldn't determine the ClCCIlOnr Carroll insisted that
he was not involved with the mailing, but shortly after
the ﬂler was mailed he apologized publicly tor “inne-
curatc statements"by the party in the brochure

Palmer opposes any such voucher plan. “This is a
