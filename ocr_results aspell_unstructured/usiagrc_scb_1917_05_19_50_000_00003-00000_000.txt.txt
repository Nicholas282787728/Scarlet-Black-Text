’ NlTA STEWART ~

“ The Girl Philippa”

By ROBERT W. CHAMBERS .

THE STAR: A mere slip of st less, a wholesome, sprightly, charming wood violet. How else can one typify Anita Stewart? Radiating the spirit of Joy and hat-
lil'aliiess, imbuing all her portrayals with that subtle quality of “soul.”—Anita Stewart‘s characterization of “The Girl Philippa," reaches tli'e'highe‘st
point of her dramatic achievements. She has beauty—she has chai'mishe has magnetism. She is dainty in manner, poised in action and finished in
performance. Her wide range and control of delicate emotions, her ability to register her feelings and thoughts so as to convey them to the and
ience, her rare grace of body and her finely chiseled features not only make her the ideal Philippa, but America‘s most popular heroine.

THE PLAY: “The Gll'l Philippa,” from the pen of America’s greatest novelist, is a tale of two hearts told in terms of love, war, locality and adventure, aglow
with color and romance, alive with movement and action, set in an atmosphere charged with secret agents society intrigue Hand blood lust—the magic
spell of the author‘s genius has woven a splendidly delightful love theme that charms and pleases. “The Girl Philippa” is as fragrant as the Wild
rose. Its tempo is like the speed fire of a machine gun. The story plays the music of the heart.
