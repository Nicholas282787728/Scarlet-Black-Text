'Over twenty addresses delivered to
nearly eighty-live college newspaper
enthusiasts were hilt one of the many
big features of [he Iowa College Press
convention at Colfax, March 23 and 24.

The convention was marked by its
enthusiasm and spirit. From the time
the party first assembled in Des Moln-
es on Friday morning until Miss Mar~
garet Irving of Ames gave the last
talk, the only word to pass the lips of
the delegates was concerning newspa-

pers.
Four l’lnnts.

Over forty people toured the plants
of the Des Moines Capital and Regis-
ter on Friday morning. At the Capital
Ex-Senator Lafc Young addressed the

explained to the novices. At the Regr
ister, Harvey Ingham himself led the
people through the plant; showing
them everything in person.

“Sec” Tnylor Speaks.

men and women assembled in the ho—
tel at Colfax for the opening exercis-
es. Chairman Bennett of Grinncll gave

order came Professor heckman of

My dear Beck:—

1 was very sorry not to keep my
promise with you last Friday or
Saturday. Friday morning I parti-
c’lpated in a. mollycoddle game of
handball up at the Y, M. C. A. and
broke the little finger on my right
hand. it slowed me down so with
my drawing that I din't get my
work out of the way in time to go

. to Colfax, as I had expected.

I am very Sorry, as I understand
they had a very successful conven-
tion, and Mr, Ingham came back

NEW PBESS SERVICE
TO BE ESTABLISHED

Will BeJLIollcllf-tl Alter The Associated
Press—One Itcprcscututlrc iu
Each College—T0 Furnish
News Upon Request To
Other Members.

A new service modeled after the
Associated Press is one of the features
of the new Iowa College Press associv
ation. It is intended for the exchange
of news between Colleges.

The new service will consist of an
Iowa College Press representative at
each college appointed by the editor of
the college paper. This man will be

_alone responsible for the association

news sent out from his institution.
Whenever a representative at some
other institution requests news of him
it is his duty to furnish it at the time
specified. This is of especial value at

‘football and basketball games and oth-

cl' contests. According to the plan the

‘Tepi‘esenmtive at the college whcro

the game is played must furnish news
of the contest to any association mem-
ber who requests it,

Association representatives are ex-
pected to send out important news

gwhenever it is available without walt-

lng for requests from other institu-
tions. A regular weekly letter was
deemed more or less unnecessary be~
cause exchanges Would give the same
information in better form.

The Gl'innell repl‘esenthtive of the
Iowa College Press will he announced
within a few days.

A FEW SNAP SHOTS OF THE CONVENTION DELEGATES

 

The Colfax car line is human like
the rest of nS.—it has its ups and
downs.

We never saw such a demand for
girls as at the dance. Some even had
the boys line up.

Judging from the space given in

ther papers, President Malh's talk
was oné of the hits of the convention.

Not a "nut” or potato at the conven-
tion. The hotel was righting the groc-
er’s high prices.

Prof. Conger Reynolds of Iowa gave
some valuable pointers on the practi-
cal side of newspapering.

"The trouble with you young college
folk is that you know we much.”~
Lafc Young.

w»,

gest newspaper men in the state
are glad he was elected one or t‘io 4'
rectors.

"Different from any other organiza-
tion in the whole United States," is
the opinion of Professor Beckman as
to the new association. He says it is
different because of its educational
side which makes, it of inestimablc
value.

James Rhodes of the Newton Daily
News said that when he was a college
editor and was not called to the presi—
dent’s office on the day after publica-
tion, be either was seriously ill or out
of the city.

Iowa. State Student: "Our Iowa
friends went out at the some time as
we did in the front page make-up from
test. Perhaps the fact that Frofcssors
Bockman and Reynolds acted as judge
es helped." And yet Pride and Roland
helped select the judges.

Des Moines Capital. When he was

The Highlander: “The last nail had
been driven and what had long been a
vague dream had materialized into an
organization, the IOWA College Press.
There havc been few Iowa editors who
have not dreamed of. a. time when all
the colleges of the state would be
brought together in an organization of
this kind, but it. remained for Walter
W. Bennett. editor of the Grihhell
Scarlet and Black, to launch a cam—
paign which culminated in a two days’
Conventiun at Colfax and the organi-
zation of the thirteen colleges repre<
sented into a working body."

One of the strongest Supporters of
the college journalism .‘organization
movement this year has been Harvey
Ingham, editor of the Des Moines Reg-
ister. He has always been ready to do
anything he could. Much of the suc-
Cess of the January Scarlet and Black
conference at Colfax was due to Mr.
Ingllam's presence. If the later state
convention can be regarded as an out-
growth of this, than much has depend-
ed on Mr. Ingllztm. Last Week, too, he
Was right on hand to lead the party
through his plant and explain all deg
fails in person. He was also one of
the most willing speakers. So in a
sense Harvey Ingham is one of the
”fathers" of the Iowa College Press
association.

Cosmos, Is New Press
President.

“Moot at Colfax next year” was the
slogan of the first Iowa College Press
convcution at Colfax March 23 and 24.
Croat enthusiasm in college newspaper
work resulted in the formation at that
time of a permanent association of col—
lege newspapcrs to be called the Iowa
College Press.
Adopts Constitution.

A constitution was adopted at the
time. This was presented by the cork
stitution committee consisting of Ed -
ors Kreger of Cornell, War—oer of Le—
ander Clark and Culver of Upper Iowa.
It provided for uniting Iowa college
newspapers into a permanent associa-
tion with a three-fold purpose, for
"promoting friendly relations between
the colleges, to maintain high stand-
ards of college journalism, and to aid
in the solution of problems for the fu~
turc cditors and business managers of
college papers."

Grinncll Lands Office.

Crinncll landed one of the offices
for next year. This was Don Clark,
who becomes one of the directors of
the new organization. John Battin of
Coc, who has been one of the strong—
est backers of the convention, is the
new president. iW. J. Donahue of Ames
and formerly a student in Grinnell, is
vice president. Ken Mathews of Cor-
nell. secretary, and the board of d!—‘
rectors include Prof. F, W. Beckman
of Ames, C. K. Warncr of Leander
Clark, Don Clark of Grinnell and Ho-
mer Roland of Iowa. These men will
plan a convention for next year and
carry on the affairs of the association
for the next twelve months.

To the Editor:

Just a line of the most sin-
cere congratulations for the
honor which came to the "s.
g B." at Colfax. I am proud
that I used to write for'a paper
of its calibre, and this year it
is better than ever. '

Perhaps one reason it seems
so is because Grinnell news is
very precious.
