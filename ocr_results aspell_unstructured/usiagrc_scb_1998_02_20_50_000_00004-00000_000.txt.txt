Don’t Ask Me, I

BY LIZZ WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

Due to the popularity oflast week's
advice column and the many lives
Lizz has helped. we decided to run
another series of questions and an-
swers.

Dear Lizz,

I hate Grinnell, It’s a cold and
lonely place. All 1 want is someone
to sleep next to, someone to love,
I’m sick of people. Hell, 1 want a
dog. Iguess i don’t have any ques—
tions, really. I think you're
supemeat.

- Ratboy in Rawson
DearRatboy,
Um, thanks. 7L

Dear Lizz,

I threw a party last weekend and a
bunch of sketchy people showed up.
They all took off their clothes and
left them in my apartment, How do
I keep them from coming back for
their clothes?

- 833 is Enough
Dear Margaret,

I suggest leaving all lltEtr clothes
in the used clothing drive box in the
Forum. That way you don't have to
see them, they don ’I have to see you,
and if they don ’t act soon, new people
can have new stuffta wear Sketchy
people take note. -L

Dear Lizz,

Does this letter make me look fat?
~Neurotic in Norris
Dear Neurotic,

Stop worrymg about what you look

Dear Lizz.

I graduate in three months, What
should I do?

, Scared Senior
Dear Senior,

There are many options open to you
after Gritmcll. I Suggest (Irug deal-
ing. There are big pmftlr in selling
drugs, especially crack. Look at the
high rollers portrayed weekly on
show: like COPS who get to chive
around in fancy cars with fancy-100k-
ing types, Anciyilrl Iliink how high
class you’ll round when you get In
tell everyone about how you ’re in the
pharmaceutical inclllsll): -L

Dear Lizz,

A really cute professor of mine
keeps on talking to me after class.
Sure he phrases it like “You need to
stop coming to class high” and “You
really need to start going to lhc write
ing lab.“ But you know, 1 think Pros
fessor wants something
more in our relationship than Just
teacher and sludcnt. What should I
do?

, Confused in Clark
Dear Confused.

Go for it.‘ Lam 'r illillk ofa better
way to get extra help and altealioo
than sleeping with your Prof, And
you’ll probably get on A, You‘ll
bmlg honor to the ward honor roll.

Dear Lizz,

My roommates keep getting drunk
and throwing things at me, usually
whiskey bottles And they get high
all the time and don‘t share their
drugs with me. Should I move out?
, Bruised on Broad Street
Dear Bruised,

No. You 're lucky someone want:
to live with you at all. Arid besides,
don’t they throw whiskey bottles at
you because you burn them with your
cigarettes? And look on the bright
side, Sometime: there’s still whiskey
in the bottles so you have something
to drink that will ever] help alleviate
the pain. -L

It's hard to remember what real
work is like here. People run across
campusalotsnyingthingslike,“0h,
I have so much work to do," or “I
have to do somc work on my read-
ing" or other such ridiculous state-
ments They then proceed to sit
down on a big overstuffed chair in
Bob’s, cappuccino and cigarette In
hand, and cozily rest their poor, overe
worked eyes on the 18 pages of
“work" their horrible professors
bosses have assigned them to read.
School is hard, Really hard, Be-
tween the 16 hours of classes we
have to attend a week, innumerable
pages of reading we have to do and
the research we have to conduct on
Burling fourth, it is hard to find time
to watch the Simpsons, play pool and
get drunk. I, for one, can’t wait for
Spring Break.

It’s easy to feel like college life is
difficult. I know. But it’s just not.
Work on that one for a while.

Mary was telling me last night
about how glad she is that she got
promoted at the meat»packing plant
because she no longer has to stand
outside in the freezing cold forty
hours a week to shove the beef from
dead cattle. She is excited to hear
that she might be able to take the day
off on her birthday. John has no
qualms about the way he is treated
like a robot by his employer on the
night shiftievery night: he's JUSI
grateful to have ajob considering his
prosthetic leg, Alice's employer has
told her not to speak to the people
whose carelessly dropped the trash
she is charged with picking up week
after week. Work.

I have to go to class, slice meat,
sweep and mop at the deli and then
go work on my paper for three hours
tonight. I’m working on my column.
Tough day. But at no moment Will I
feel dehumanized, disgusted or defe
erential. 1 will not sweat, Ifl feel
sick, I can call the Health Center and
spend the day at home playing gut.
tar, I“ become sleepy, I can take a
nap, I can take breaks and have ciga-
rctles and beer as needed. I can do
my work on my couch under my
comforter in my underwear if I want.
I can work next to the phone in case
my friend calls. I can even decide
not to do my work at all. My world
Wlll riot crumble and I Will still have
food to put in my mouth,

We‘re pretty goddamn lucky

around here. But we get so wrapped
up in our walk that we become aca-
demtc Zombics: spoiled brats Is it
that our brains are so full of equae
tions and analyses that we can't no-
tice that there are people in this
world who work in order to make
our lives this comfortable? There are
lots ofthcm. Someone mops up our
muddy trucks. Someone picks up
our Snickers wrappers and someone
delivers out postcards and makcs our
food and sits it in front of our over
worked faces and cleans tlte dishes
when we’re done. Someone built
ARH and polished it and mowed the
lawn and shovelcd the Walk: work

Please remember that the things
other people do to make our lives
this easy is work, Considering the
comfort we take for granted at our
tiny rich school, they must he work
ing pretty hard, And sometimes they
would likc to call the Heallh Center
and sit at home and play guitar all
day too, They can’t. That’s work.
And the people who do it for us den
serve our respect and thanks. In fact,
they deserve exponentially more rce
speci than anybody who complains
about their reading as if they have
to clock on at the factory after the
quotas have just been rlliscd. I'm
asking that students and faculty her
come aware of the people most or.
ten overlooked in our little campus
community: the people in the blue
shirts or red trucks whose presence
is crucial to our comfort. Because
they work, And we rarely do. We
study.

 

Letters

to the Editor

To the Grinnell Community:

This letter is a response to a series
of RISE documents and protests
against US-led military action in
Iraq, I attended the gathering on Fri-
day, February l3 in the Forum and
found most of the views presented
extremely misleading. Additionally,
the documents appearing on bath
room walls throughout campus are
ﬁlled with mistakes. I intend to Show
thal the current economic sanctions
and military coalition in the Persian
Gulf is not a conspiracy to destroy
Iraqi culture as suggested by partici-
pants in the RISE protest, but rather
a legitimate attempt by the world to
maintain stability and security in the
Middle East. Besides, if the United
States really wished to destroy Iraqi
culture, they could have accom-
plished that goal the first time
around. First, to dispel some myths
perpetuated by RISE:

1) There is no serious evience to
suggest that the United States and
Britain will use tactical nuclear
weapons against Iraq. With the pos-
sible exceptions of a drunken out-
burst by Boris Yeltsin or “intuition"
as quoted from a speech last Friday,
there is no valid evidence suggest.
ing a nuclear attack against Iraq is
under consideration. The conven»
tionul air strikes that opened the Gulf
War were sufficient to destroy most
of Iraq’s infrastructure, communica—
tions systems, and power supplies,
A nuclear attack was not needed then
and is not needed now. In fact, the
only weapons under consideration
for a military attack against Iraq are
Tomahawk cruise missiles and 5,000
pound deepspenelralion bombs.
These weapons are capable of ac
complishtng us goals without
nuclear weapons. Any talk ota lac»
tlcal nuclear attack is misleading.

2) The issue of economic sanctions
is clear. RISE maintains that “Iraq
has no hope of ever ending the em-
barge." However, the conditions for
ending the embargo are really quite
simple. The agreement between the
Security Council and Iraq that ended
the GulfWar allows UN inspectors
access to all sites suspected of hold»
ing weapons of mass—destruction or
components ofihese weapons. Once
the UN inspectors conﬁrm that Iraq
no longer holds nuclear, chemical, or
biological weapons, or the means to
produce them, the sanctions will be
lifted It is Saddam Hussein’s refusal
to admit inspectors into sites which
is causmg the delay. Without access
to all sites, as agreed to at the end of

the war, the UN is unable to confirm
that Iraq is free of such weapons.
Thus, it is Saddam Hussein himself
who is responsible for the prolonged
economic sanctions.

3) The us is acting under the juris-
diction of international law and the
United Nations. According to the
ceasefire document, any infringes
merit of the ceasefire may be met
with military action. In this case,
since Iraq has violated its pledge to
open sites for inspection, the US and
UK are justified in using military
force to both destroy suspected
weapons sites and force Saddam
Hussein into compliance. The UN
Security Council would have to pass
a resolution explicitly outlawing
military force in order for the US and
UK to be in violation of international
law. I

4) The UN is taking signiﬁcant steps
to reduce the suffering of the Iraqi
people. The British are currently
drafting a resolution, supported by
the US, to increase the oilefor-food
program from $2 billion to $5.9 bil-
lion for the next two sixemonth peri-
ods. Unfortunately, it is Saddam

Hussein‘s unfair distribution of this ,

food which is exacerbating the can
tastrophe. In addition, spending on
medicine would increase in this same
period from $210 million’ to $567
million, This significant increase
shows willingness on the part of the
UN to aid the Iraqi people,

Of course, I do believe that diploe
matic measures should be exhausted
before an air strike takes place.
Moreover, military measures short of
bombing, such as expanding the no
ﬂy zone and blocking illegal Iraqi oil
sales should be undertaken before an
air strike commences. However,
nothing short of complete compli-
ance is acceptable. Should all of
these attempts fail, the US and UK
are justiﬁed in Seeking an air strike
for the following reasons:

I) Iraq does indeed have chemical
and biological weapons with the rcqe
uisne delivery systems which pose a
significant threat to other states in the
Middle East. In the past twenty
years, Iraq has proven its aggressive
nature through invasions ofboth Iran
and Kuwait. Moreover, Iraq has
shown a willingness to use biologi-
cal and chemical weapons in the
IraneIraq War and against the Kurds
inside Iraq, New evidence suggests
that Iraq may have experimented
wtih Kuwaiti prisoners during the
Gulsztr because of mass graves of
Kuwaiti citizens located directly Outs

side known weapons facilities. Ade
ditionally, estimates suggest Iraq has
up to sixteen SCUD missile deliv—
ery systems which can carry nuclear,
biological, or chemical payloads.
These are divided between the Al-
Hussein missile whtch has a range
of 403 miles and the AleAbbas mis:
sile which can be launched 620
miles. Based on the Iraqi record, the
UN can take no chances in preserve
mg the safety of other nations in the
Middle East.

2) The military strike would put
pressure on Saddam to open up all
suspected weapons sites. Amililary
strike would send the message that
the UN really does mean business.
Saddam must not be allowed to get
away with undermining the Iegilie
macy of the UN.

3) A military strike would destroy
some of Iraq‘s chemical and biologi-
cal weapons, UN inspectors have
isolated sites to which Hussein has
denied them access but which are
suspected of containing materials as
sociated with weapons production.
Thus, striking these facilities would
undoubtedly destroy some of
Hussein‘s weapons and weapons
developing facilities.

4) The legitimacy of the UN is at
stake in this situation. Ifthe UN does
nothing to enforce its resolutions, the
prospect of the UN as an effective
governing body diminishes. Iraq
freely agreed to thc cease—ﬁre. And
now that they are backing out ofthe
agreement, the UN looks weak if it
is unable to enforce its own agree-
ments, By not acting, the UN would
set a terrible example for the rest of
the world

As a whole, I do honestly hope that
a military strike can be avoided.
However, for the reasons labeled
above, should Iraq continue to defy
the United Nations, the UN has a
responsibility to enforce lhc cease
lire by any means necessary.

Sincerely,
Jeff chncr ’99

Tales From
Another World

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN

Isure don't like war, It makes it very
hard to sleep ntnight, Itmakes it very
difficult to dream,

War 15 worry, worry that ﬁlls your
head. How can you rise above this
earth will! a weight like that at
tachcd? War makes me wonder about
the beauty oflife; life for the sake of
bringing death? How can that be?
How can life be made worthless?

I sure don‘t like the feeling ofblood
on my hands, but I do like to feel
good on a Friday afternoon, so some
times I lose myself and deny the
bloodesoaked llfe,

I don‘t know who is innocent. l
lliiuk the numbers are too few to care.

Wur takes the power from my mind.
It's something I'm not willing to une
derstand.

Despite thinking hateful violent
thoughts, I have never hit anyone,
except one guy who was trying to rob
the and that wasjust reﬂex, like all
this war may be. It would be easier
to deal WIIh it that Way, knowing that
it was just the nature ofa beast, that
the problem is not our actions, but
my misinterpretation of the nature of
humankind. It is better than the ale
tcrnalive, that humankind is beauti~
ful and kind and loving and that de-
spite reason we are trying to kill each
other before the realization,

When I‘m laying in bed, I don’t
think of babies crying amidst bombs,
or children pounding ﬁsts over their
dead mothers’ bodies, and I don't
think about the psyche of the soldier
firing in the direction of strangers.
Laying in bed, long hours awake,i
am thinking of the silence. Anxiously
awake, I am grateful for the breath
beside me.

An epic story unfolds as Grinnellians
ﬁght the epic battle between dance
iiig and drunkenness. As if you
needed another reason to love Disco,
we present the top ten ways Disco
lives on in the Star Wars Trilogy:

10) Going into hyperspace is like
running really fast towards the Disco
ball while drunk.

9) Aunt Beru wore a mean pant suit.
8) The Death Star was simply a gin
aiit Disco ball with the ability to den
slroy worlds (a small technicality).
7) Stormtroopers had abnormally
large codepicces. You know they
stuff their crolches.

6) Laiido Calrisslzm. Enough said.
5) With all the beer and brut, Harris
is a lot like a iauntaun: And you
thought it smelled bad on the outside.
4) Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.
Everyone at Disco looks as good as
they do (dark and dmnk is how we
ltke it).

3) What you wake up next to the
morning after Disco looks more like
Iabba.

2) It's not the size or color of your
lightsaber, it's how you use it.

1) Chewbacca had sideburns that
went down to his knees.
