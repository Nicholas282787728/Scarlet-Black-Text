\Vouldn't it be it godsend if this
institution were to fall heir to EL gift
of $4,200,000? That is precisely what
has just happened to the California
Institute of Technolog' located in
Pasadena. The gift was made by
Arthur H. Fleming, president at the

board of trustees. Other gifts which
he has made bring the total up to more
than $5,000,000. Calitolnia Tech bids
tail» to become one or the two leading
institutes or technology in the coun—
try. It ranks very favorably with
Boston Tech and Cornell University at
present, and the new gift will enable
it to branch out into further research,
improve the personnel of its faculty,
and provide more facilities for the

A very disturbing hook is MARTIN

Eleanor Farjeon (Stokes) Disturbing,
because it keeps eluding classiﬁcation.
Now it is a light fairy tale done in
pastel colors, now it tries to be a his-
torical romance; and ever so often
it slips into the dramatic form, Poetry
is sprinkled all through to season it.

Perhaps there is a little too much
kissing in this dainty Stvry. "Martin
caught her in his arms and kissed her
on the mouth and on the eyes and on

and on the back of the neclr where
babies are kissedf and standing her up
on the barrel and himself on the
ground, he hissed her- feet, one after
the other." After reading

did he not also kiss her on her Spanish

Another farce has just been present-
ed by two of our literary societies.
Farce seems to be the reigning favor—
lte with those who select the plays
which campus oiagnizatiolls have been‘
giving the past two or three years
Looking back Over the plays which
Glinncll audiences have seen Present-
ed by local talent, it is really surpris-
ing to see the predominant position
which farce takes In the list 0! plays

But [area does not iit in with the
professed purposes of the campus or-

i

in; them. The Dramatic Club has as
its professed purpose the presentatiopl
of a. high order of drama. But the
Club plays of the last three years.
'Ccme Out of the Kitchen", “Adam and
Eva", . d "Three Live Ghosts", cannot
be classed in the highest class of
,drama. These plays have been divert-
ing and well presented, but surely not
of a high order. In fact the Club
elevated "Three Live Ghosts" to com-
ad)! of a. higher sort than the oﬁglnall
Broadway presentation.

The announcement of the club's in—

demonstration, or whatever you want'

both cheeks and on her two hands,l

probably stands higher than any of the
plays presented in the past tllo years
“Strictly Conﬁdential" was also coin-
edy of a high order, but “The Show
Elliot)” cannot be classed as such.

“The Show Shop" was a musical
comedy p'lot combined with a largo
supply of ol-phelun tricks. in fact the
rchoarasl scene is almost identical
with a popular act on the Orpheum
circuit of a year- or two ago. when
there was a scene which even pretend-
ed to be dramatic it was turned into a
farce situation.

There is no quostion that “The Show
Shop" was a laugh-getter, and as such
satisﬁed a large nurnbe'r of people. if
it is the purpose of the Dramatic Club
and the literary societies to make us
laugh, they have succeeded. They

,liavc also llrabably made a little money

for themselves. But making us laugh
and milking money are nut the pro-
fessed purposes of these organizations.
They are supposed to be leaders in
giving the people that which is of a.
high order in drama.

This Is not an appeal for the presen-
taliuu Bf ”Hetmelt". Such a presenta-
tion would be ludicrous and almost a.
profanatlon of Shakespeare. But We
‘snrely can have drama of a higher
larder than "Three Live Ghosts" and
"The snow Shop" without trying to
appear [00 hlgh bI‘OW 01' possessed of

_ Dear Editor:

1 too would like to offer a thought
for the “What DO You Think” column.
it is concerning our defeat by the
leklahuma team last night Doubtless,

ny oi the spectators witnessing the
game could have pointed out errors on
the part of the team; doubtlessly, also,
the some persons would ,have seen
the same errors in a diiferent light
had they been a member of the team.
But that is not the point that I wish
to comment upon. The team did their
best, and win or lose, we are behind
them.

But, what can be said for those in—
dividuals who becoming bored with
the game left before it was over? Not
very much. They attempted to wash
their hands of their team s defeat, be
cause the game was not played to suit
them. They thought, 'perhaps, that
they were showing their own individ—
\Iztlity. It is even possible‘, but rather
improbable, that they made this cute
ward jibe thoughtlessly. Neverthe
less, thoughtlessly or not, they and
they, alone placed the only blotch on
the honor of Gl-innell' at the game last
night They cast the only rcllection,
if reilection there was ‘ They com—
’plise that small element of yellow
which we could so well do without.

Griuncll has always been known for
its ﬁghting spirit. The team in v-lce
tor-y or defeat is our team, express-
ing the personality of the student body
by its conduct on the floor. ‘It is up
to “S to back it and back it to the last.
We will ,lvin our greatest victories by
studying ollr most bitter defeats. Last
night the team admittedly did
riot play up to standard, and the game
was classed, and perhaps justly so,
as "rotten," Eut rotten as it may
lrnve been, little more could be said
of the rooting. Their yelling was
slovenly and lifeless, their cheers were
only heard when the ball went
through the hoop. The entire game
lacked the ﬁner spirit of active and
wholehearted backing of the team.
Nevertheless, up to the last the honor
of Grinnell was not lowered until
those few persons left, as they said
“in disgust.” The disgust is, however,

,ill the eyese of the remaining students
,toward them, and is not in the least

a reflection on: the team. From now
on let us have at least enough court-
esy to remain to the last and root and

,cheer and yell as hard as we expect

the team to play.

GRINN ELL FIFTEEN

As was expected, Grinnell had little,
difficulty in winning from Drake in
the basketball game Tuesday evening.
The rural score was Grinnell 42, Drake
22. Thc game was rough, one of the
roughest in fact that has ever been
played on the local floor. Both teams
were holding continually, Drake being
the worst oitender in this respect. ,

was the readings from “Hamlet" given
by Professor Ryan.

Grinnell Won the ﬁrst game of their

lege in at hard-fought battle. The ﬁnal
