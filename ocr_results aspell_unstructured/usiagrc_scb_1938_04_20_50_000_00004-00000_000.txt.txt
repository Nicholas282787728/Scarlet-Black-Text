FEE, H, to, FUM--l SMELL A mung

Congress killed a sensible, reasonable
bill designed to reorganize the executive
department of the federal government, and
make it a more workable, efficient branch
of government.

The bill had been deleted of any
clauses that even had a remote resemblance
to dictatorial power.

The only danger revealed was the
danger, not of presidential dictatorship, but
ofthe dictatorship of demagogues Father
Coughlin, Frank Gannett and a few die-
hard politicians who drummed up a paper
avalanche of telegrams, sent by people with
two»for-a—nickel brains.

What liberty loving Americans should
mourn is the indication that Congress was
willing to play the game of those whose
policy it is to wield power without respon-
sibility. The telegram senders and the Re-
vere marchers were a negligible fraction of
the electorate, and gave every indication of
acting not for conviction but from an emo-
tional reaction to well directed propaganda,

In any democracy there will always be
a proportion of people who, never having
acquired the habit of original thought, will
vibrate like banjo strings under the pluck-

,ing of propaganda.

This is no surprise. But that they
exacted the obedience of Congress shows
that our dictator will come, not from the
president, but from a few demagogues who
have the power to command obedience from
Congress; even though those same demagd
gucs Ilold no responsiéi'le political office,

TOWARDS A MORE BEAUTIFUL
CAMPUS

Has your conscience ever felt just a
bit weighty when you “tripped" across the
f‘lawn" in front of the library? Cognizant
of both,,how irresistible is this temptation,
and of how heavy is the conscience of the
student‘who has just wielded to it, the ad
ministration has reached a solution. With
the aid’of the horticulture class, Japanese
rose bushes will be set in along the side—
walk in 'front of the library.

' “This problem has long been neglected.
We 11013 that students will cooperate with
‘tlie administration and that they will realize
that it is a matter of civic pride to keep
our campus looking well.

Someone said, “It’s the little things
that count." We could well bear that state-
ment in mind, especially when we have to

, make an eight o’clock in nothing flat, and
even when we feel that we must just toss
our empty cigarette packages on the cam»
pus.

In a short time Rosa rngosa (Japanese
rose, to you) will be in our midst, Let us
be kind to her and remember her purpose.
Let’s have a campus to be proud of

“THE NATION" AND GRINNELl

“The Nation,” well known weekly news
commentary, is conducting a poll of its
readers, plus 130 thousand so-called “liv
berals" on “A Foreign Policy for America."

To date, the ballotting shows that 16.7
percent believe that a general policy of iso-
lation would offer this country its best in—
Surance against war, whereas 83.3 percent
believe ill a general policy of collective
action, involving (1) “economic measures
directed against offending ‘powersf’ (2)
“economic support for victims of aggres—
sion,” (3) “the threat of collective armed
resistance to aggression ;“ and (4) the
”amendment of the Neutrality act to per-
mit economic aid to victims of aggression,“

Not everyone of the 833 per cent sup-
ported all these measures. It is interesting
to note that about 80 per cent of all those
voting favor “the application of voluntary
popular boycotts,” Also, to show how even—
ly intelligent opinion is divided on the ques-
tion of a war referendum, it is interesting
to find that 47.7 percent believe that we
should have a war referendum, while 523
percent are opposed to such a referendum.

The Grinnell student committee on in-
ternational affairs is getting ready for a
Grinnell peace week, and has had the idea
of a student referendum in mind. We won-
der how the Grinnell student body would
divide as compared with persons answering
the poll taken by “The Nation.”

__c
INTEREST NEEDED

Because of the pertinent nature of in-
ternational problems at the present time, it
has been suggested that it might be made
possible for more students to keep up on
current affairs by attending the Contem-
porary history class, taught by Professor
Payne.

To make the class available to more
students, the meetings could be held in the
afternoons, when more people have free
time at their disposal, By participating in
the discussion, the student could get a
ground work for his thinking on inter-
national affairs, which he could supplement
with outside reading.

There are certain curricular difficulties
which would have to be ironed out, if such
a plan were to be instituted However, if
the strident body showed enough sincere
interest in the working out of such a
scheme, it could probably be arranged, if
only for a limited number of students.

TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT

Tonight’s the night of the annual Men‘s
Glee c1le home concert, the 44th such can-
cert to be given by the Glinnell club.

And this year, at the special request of
former members of the club, a special group
of songs is a part of ’the program. In addi-
tion to that, the club, is featuring two
numbers rarely attempted by similar groups
because of their difficulty.

Listeners tonight will have an oppor-
tunity to hear a glee club so famous that
once on a time supporters, perhaps slightly
over enthusiastic, termed it the “best in
the west.”

There are plenty of people left who
think the slogan still holds good. At any
rate, “tonight’s the night” to find out.

PART OF SPRING

Tomorrow and Friday the women‘s
athletic department will present, under the
direction of Miss Clara Julia Anderson, the
dance drama, “The Firebird.”

This particular type of presentation
alternates annually with the May Fete as
the project of the department during the
spring season. This year, as usual, much
effort has been expended to make the per-
formance a memorable one.

As an integral part of the spring pro—
gram at Grinnell, it‘s a production you
can‘t afford to miss.
