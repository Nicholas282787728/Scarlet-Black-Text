One hundred colored prints of well

The fourth performance'of the play
production class on Saturday evening
gave Prof, w. H. Rl Trumbnner an on»
poi-thnlty to sing his swan song.
During his year in Gl'lnnell Mr, Trum-
bauer has completely rte-organized the
dramatic department, regulated the
current of amateur offerings and in-
troduced orderlnto what was fol-mer-
ly hodge-pudge. Mr. Trumbauer has
'also succeeded in resusci'tating more
feeble plays from the halls of Lhe two.
easy than we have ever hoped to see
in a town without its Ol'pheum or
Pantages circuit.

Saturday’s bill included only one
play of any intrinsic merit, Tcheckov’s
"The Proposal," with appropriate set
ting by Howard Backus, approximated
what a well permrmed oneract play
should be, Miss Chaney. Mr. Van
Horn Mid MI. Burt revealed dramatic
ability of the lirst order, In costumes
and tempo the play was all that we
could wish.

Reversing the, chronological order
we next consider Paul Greene's “The
last of the tom-lee." The setting was
excellent, done in the realistic man—
ner, but the actors were apparently
not quite awake. \

It showed evidence of caretnl direc-
tion and did not lack merits. Miss
Sherman and Miss Kiewit old the best
or any members or the cast.

Trixie Friganza was doing some—
thing closely akin to "The Sequel”
when she celebrated her sixty-fourth
hll’thday. . Why Miss Baldock's care-
In] direction and Miss Cox's gestures
should he wasted on a play or this
kind must be investigated by someone
not of this department.

If Maurice Baring were to stake his
reputation on “The Adlis Difficulty”
Mother Britannia would lay'no claim
to him. Here again an excellent com“
blnztion oi setting, pantomine and‘
lighting went for naught. This de~
partmcnt believes that Miss Tone pas-
sesses a remarkable gift for broad

comedy, and that Mlss Somers should
