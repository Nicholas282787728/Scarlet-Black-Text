After Me

A dialogue on poslrgrads

onee there was an uppertlassrnan that
eaine upon a hrsteyear standing alone on
eentral eampus. The ﬁrst-year was staring
solemnly at the ground where a small dead
bird lay eurled and still. He poked the bird
withastiekmitsblank, dead eyes. Asingle
tear rolled down his eheek, and fell to the
ground near to the little bird.

The npperelassman, remembering what
it was like to be a ﬁrst-year and to not un.
derstand things like these, approaehed the
boy and put an arm around his shoulder.

“Where do seniors go when they gradu.
ate?" The boy asked as aseeond tear joined
the growing puddle near the bird. “Does
anyone know where they go you know,
after..."

Having been faeedwidi answering sueh
a diffieult question asked by one so young,
the upperelassman took time to earefully
choose his words. “Well," he said ﬁnally,
"they leave us all behind and journey to the
Real world."

“is it dark (here’"

“Yes,"

“Is the Real World like Heaven?" the
boy asked.

“Not etaetly. in Heaven, loans eease to
matter, and in Heaven, the job market is
friendly to those trained in the Humani—
ties. Also, in Heaven you have enough to
eat, and you aren't lonely and you're rent is
less than 90 pereent ofyour earnings, and
serviee yobs don’t exist, and I’m not sure,
but, I think, in Heaven you don't have to
cook."

“so the Real world is like Hell. then?”
the boy asked.

“No, it's not exactly like Hell. when
you've entered the Real world, it means
you've graduated from tollege, lemember?
Plus, hell is her. and bemgintheRead World
usually means beeoming eold. so very
cold."

“I iiist don't think it's fair," said the boy,
still poking the dead bird with the stielt.
“Why does everyone have to graduate? How
ean they not leave me alone here. like my
cmnipa and old Mrs, Johnson did?"

“Well, first-year, there eomes a time
when everyone graduates, even you and 1.
it’s natural. it's a eyele. it's the way things
have always been."

“is there any way to eontaet those who
have already passed?"

“one time we tried mm a 0ij Board.”

“What did the graduate say?"

“He said. ‘Can you spare some
ehange.>"'

“Do people who graduate ever eome
back to us in person?"

“Yes, sometimes graduates eome back
as professors. However, professors are a
spirit.like people who ran never really ever
be students again, after having :xp:fi:nc:d
the trauma of graduation and ofentering
the Real World, even ifit was only to at.
tend Grad Sd’lool."

“Grad schncl?" the boy asked, as the
light ofhope in his eyes, “What’s that?"

“Purgatory."

“Isn't mere any hope at all?"

“Nope, none. No hope at all."

Hearing all of this, the boy threw down
his stiek and began to shake. “I don't want
to graduatei I don't want to graduate!"

The upperelassman understood all too
well. “l know." me upperelaeman said. “Me

The Royal Tenenbaums (R)

Best studio tagline ofrhe year: Family isn't a word. he
a sentence,

Starring: ch Luther, Monlcl: Addams. Hanscl, Cari Spacklcr

B: My love for that tagline is bettered only by my appreciation
for this film. So much effort was poured into the characters ofthe
movie, the Tenenbaum family. The movie's plot seems like iust a
small episode of their lives. Royal (Gene Haekman) and Ethelin:
Tenenbaum (Anjcllca Huston) are the proud parents of three eliild
prodigies. There's Chas, the real estate Whiz (Ben stiller), Margot
the playwright (Gwyneth Palttow), and tennis champ Richie (Luke
Wilson). Their storybook family fraetutes when Royal and Etheline
separate, and siibsequendy eaeh child falls on hard times, Now 20
years later, Royal, a charismatie priek, ttie
to teeoniieetwith his family, due to nsup-
posedly debilitating ease of stomaeh
eaneei. This may not make sense
when I say it. but with narrator
Alec Baldwin’s gruff voiee, it is ,
delightful.

premise and plot, this
movie eseels in in details. ‘
The child :lle’S ate as
funny as the adults, and
the speeifie eosrumes tell
you so much about the eharaeters. Not to mention the poignant
souiidrmeloI Highlights are the opening orchestral version of “Hey
iude,"Tlie Ramonc’s “Judy is a punk,“ and Elliott Smith's powerful
“Needle in the Hay."

B: The remedy in The Royal Tmenb/mm: is similar to when
director Wes Anderson's last ﬁlm, Ran/imam. but has better acting
and a much more original plot strueture. it does have its share of
serious moments, and has one very unexpected romantic interest
development, but is enjoyoble throughout. in ease I haven't men.
tioned this enough, T/ae Riyal Tenenbaums is a really good movie.

Alt-country meets y’allternative

Jay Farrar plays wilh Mark Spencer in Harris this Friday, with opener Anders Parker

by James Finley
Guest Writer

one ofthe most important roele musieians ofthe ‘90s will perform Friday
night at the Harris center. Jay Farrar teeently released his first solo album,
Selmupel, and is ﬁnishing up the second leg ofhis tour in support of his reeord.
Farrar, along with Wilco fronfrman JeffTweedy, formed the extremely inﬂuenr
rial group Unele Tupelo, bringing a country feel to the hafdemck alternative
movement of the early ‘90s, before moving on to Son Volt, one of the most
suooesful albcountry bands.

Farrar left Uncl: Tupelo in early 1994 and shortly after moving to New 0r.
leans, formed Son Volt. Twccdy and the remaining members of Uncle Tupelo
formed Wilco. After sharing the song writing role in unele Tupelo. Farms had
complete ereative eontrol in Son Volt. Wirh the ﬁrst two Son Volt albums, dae
elassie Tnzre and the underrated Straighten/aye. the twangy sound ofAnadyn: and
Marc/l 16-20. 1992. has been complimented by a hizzy Neil Young—esoue eleo
rrie guitar (think "Down By the River"), and Farrar's songwriting has matured to
master status. The third, and maybe the ﬁnal, Son Volt record, Wichu/ing Tremah
has a harder. darkeredge to it. and sounds more polished.

soii Volr is (:Chnimlly on hiatus. but if Sebmrepol is any indiution, it doesn’t

look like Fanar will get baeit together with the group. sinee the sound is a big
departure from the dark, live. twangy feel of mate suing none/a. Sebmtapil, would
be a great son Volt album, but Farrar had other people in mind when he recorded
it. people sueh as Jon Wurster of supeiehunk and steve Drodae of the Violent
Femmes. it is an intredible album, lytiully dealing with a ehanging world. Musi.
oally, it brings together aeousrie musiewirh biaarre tunings, many different guitais
and keyboards and diverse percussion. The songwriting, as is to be expected from
Farmr, is strong. Thesongs areall powerful, both musially and lyrirally. The sound
is polished and elean, but Fanar's gritty, yet beautifully melodie voiee gives the
reeord a personal feel.

Farrar will play aeoustie and eleerrie guitar, performing most ofthe tunes from
sebnrepai along With a handful of son volt songs and even a eotiple from the
unele Tupelo days. Joining him on guitar will be Mark speneer of the alt.eoiintry
band the Blood oranges. on the first leg ofthe tour, the Stbaffopa/songs had more
ofa eountry feel, siiiee the studio effects and barking band were missing, whieh
worked well. foeusing on the strong struetiire of the songs, and farrat's iiieredible
voeals. Anders Parker, performing solo, will open the show. Be sure to eome on
