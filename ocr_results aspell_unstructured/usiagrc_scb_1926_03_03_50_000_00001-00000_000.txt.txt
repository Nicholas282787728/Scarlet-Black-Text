AGGLES COME HERE FRIDAY

Capniiu Wing, Moran and Coach black
to Make Final Appcnnuloe in
bloom hnskcdialldom.

The Pioneer basketball team plays
Drake tonight at Des Moines in the
final road game of the year. With ten
days rest since the Ames game the
men are on their toes and may take
the Bulldogs into camp. Last year
Grinnell was beaten on the Coliseum
floor by a score of Is to ls. Drake
dropped a game to Nebraska on Mon-
day night and with the advantage of a
rest the Scarlet and Black outfit ought
to ring up ~a second conference l'lc-
tory. The team is fully aware ofthe
fact that Drake has been victors in
the last eleven. games between the
two schools, and they will fight to
the last ditch to prevent an even dozs

Friday night the Pioneers will make
their final appearance of the season
when they meet the Kansas Aggie
quintet here. The Aggies hold second
place in the Valley conference and
lost a chance to tie for first when they
dropped a game to the Kansas Jay—
hnwkeis Monday night. As a result of
this game the Kansans won their
fourth successive basketball title. and
the Kansas Aggics will most likely
ii i second. The Agsics play at
Amos tomorrow night and end up their-
schedule here.

Black in Final Appearance

When Coach Charley Black leads his
men out on the floor for the Aggie
game it will be the last time he will
be seen in Grinnell in the capacity of
Grinncll mentor. Black will leave
soon after the completion of the bass
ketball schedule to take up his duties
as assistant football and head basket
ball coach at the University of Ne-
braska. Next season Scarlet and
Black followers will see Black lead an
opponent on the floor when he brings
his Cornhusk'ers here for one game.
Black‘s loss will he keenly felt and it
is with regret that Grinnellians watch
“Charley’s" farewell game.

Friday night is also "swan night"
for Captain I-Iarry Wing and Doyle
Moran This has been Wing's third
year on the Scarlet and black team
and he has shown up better each
season, His game at guard this past
winter has been of high order and he
has been instrumental in keeping the
defensive play of the team on a par
with most conference teams.

Final Game For Moran

When “Hap" Moran leaves the floor
after the game one of the best men
ever to represent Grinnell on the
court will finish his collegiate career.
For two years he has been the nuc-
lens of the the whole team, and has
established a reputation for himself
that extends far beyond the Missouri
Valley league, For the past two wint-
ers he has ranked high among the
individual scorers and his offensive
game has meant most of the team‘s
meagre success. l-iap uili leave a
place that will be hard to fill next
year.
en.

The Aggies will bring a powerful
team here Friday night. Early in the
season they beat Grinnell, 35 to 18. in
a rough game. Since then they have
had good luck and come here firmly
entrenched in second place, Leading
the Aggies is Capt. Koch who is one
of the best guards in the Valley. lie
has seen three years competition and
plays a bangs-iii game. He possesses
a deadly eye for long range baskets
and is seldom held scoreless.

Byers is Shiny Fol-Wart]

Byers and Weddlc are two class A
forwards who have matched their skill
with the heat in the conference. The
former has played in only ten games
but already has an average of near ten
points a game. The diminutive Aggie
is one of the hardest men to guard as
he is fast and tricky. and sports a
deadly basket attachment. Weedle
has been shifted to guard in the past
few games, but may be used here as
forward, his usual position.

Tebow will he remembered as the
tall blonde center who led the scoring

Nob Justiﬁed by Presidents.

The charges of Dr. Wettstone,
president of Dilbuque university, that
commercialism is becoming a menace
to Iowa collegiate athletics, were not
justified by the special committee rein
resenting the Iowa Association of Col-
lege President, in their meeting in Des
nIoines Saturday.

With the exception of Dr. Wettsone,
the general opinion of the committee
was that conditions were not nearly
so bad as depicted, that the scholar-
ship of athletes was not totally de-
plorable. and that in the last decade
collegiate athletics have been raised
in standard. There are the committee
admitted, exceptional cascs, but on
the whole the trend is rather encoui»
aging.

Those attending the committee
were: Dean J. S, Nollen of Grinnell
college; Dr, D. W. Morehouse, presi-
dent of Drake university; Dean Sam-
iiel Beyer of Iowa State College; Dr.
Harry Gdge,, president of Coe college;
and Dr, John L. nillman, president of

Pact and stariwcllcr to Give ltccital
on Lecture C(ll so is Allllllll' of
Lincoln iii apli

The evening of Tuesday,March 16,
has been set as the date for a recital
at Grinnell by Carl Sandburg, world
famous poet and Stol‘ystellel', whose
recent biography of \braham Lincoln
has been hailed .. the masterpiece of
a decade.

Ficturcsappeari gtnis'weo'iT—1TC l-
cago newspapers show Sandburg at
Marshall Field's, w ting his auto-
grapb into “dozen, and dozens” of his
books. Piles of his Lincoln biography
are [a melting away, say the Chicago
babe

William Allen White has declared
the Lincoln work as "lllunlin'lelltal,"
and declared that “it will stand as one
of the greatest portraits of Lincoln."
The Pictorial Review describes it as
"the most fascinating story of Lincoln
ever written." "Sandburg." says
Christopher Morley, "has achieved the
crowning success of having done the
one book that he, of all men now liv-
ing, was especially designated to do.”

Wayne Gard of Grinnell, writing in
the International Book Review, shows
how Sallfllllll‘g's likeness to Lincoln,
both in temperament and in exper-
ience, gives him a "peculiar fitness to
write about Lincoln." He stresses the
human element in Sandburg, and the
simplicity of his language. "The pics
torial quality of his words and the
directness and economy of his nal's
rative suggest the epics of Homer "

Ml', Sandburg, a Spanish war vctcr-
au with long experience as a news-
papermaii, achieved quick fame with
the publication of his "Chicago
Pounds." Since then he has written
three more books of verse and two
books of child-stories. He is now on
the editorial staff of the Chicago Daily
News, but is in great demand as a
lecturer.

of the Grinnell Glove Company in his
talk on "Ethics in Business” before
an audience of about fifty men in
the clubroom of Smith hall Sunday of.
ternoon, The meeting was the fi st
of a series to be held by the newly oi»
ganizcd Business club.

Elaborating on his definition of
success llIr. Lannom said that a lllauu»
facturer now has to sell as near cost
as possible, If for some reason the
company made an enormous profit
one year, and then next year did not
give it back to the consumer in the
form of lower prices, increased qual-
ity, or improvements, or to the lahoiu
er in the form of wages, a bank would
consider lending to that company a
risk because it believes a firm fomid-
ed on such gl-abbing principles is
temporary and bound to fall in time.

Banks Investigate

Most large banks, iic continued, now
have an “industrial engineer," a man
well trained in the theory and prac-
tise of business, whom they will send
out on request free of charge to
i . igatc a business and make reports
on H.

Turning to the man who gives his
services, he said it was just as lmvorts
out for him to know the worth of his
service as for the manufacturer to
know the cost of his product, He cant
afiorfl to work for less than he is
worth.

Washingrton correspondent S. and B.
Gives “LowDown” On U. 5. Capital

From Loren D. Reid, Washington
- iii correspondent of the Scarlet and
Black, we have just learned the true
significance of the birthday of George
Washington.

George is the guy who did three im-
portant things; he was father of a
country, he licked the British and he
never lied. In the words of our als~
tinguished corresspondent, "I don’t
kiow which of these is the hardest but
you may have your choice." Let it
suffic'e'iliat in the spirit of the sub
icct matter in hand, the reader must
believe that hi is 'written in the gen
eral neighborhood of the truth.

W shington, the city, is not like
Grinncll. Our correspondent hadn’t
been there twelltysfonr hours before
he heard some one say, “50's you ole
man," and not a soul laughed. ,Before
Reid had been in Washington thirty-
six hours, he was aware of the fact
that Washington people know what
the Charleston is, and can play “I
Never Knew," and “Sleepy Time Gal."

Strangely enough the i“ st thing
our correspondent did on arriving in

the capital city was not to hunt up the
latest juicy political scandal; rather
he went Lu a theatre to get the low
down on the Charleston. But on see-
ing the new step danced by an exceed-
ingly beautiful and well»dressed young
danseuse (well dressed in the sense of
quality, not quantity) Mr. Reid decid-
ed that natural aesthetic and athletic
ability needed to accomplish such dif—
ficult feats was far beyond him, and
he therefore left the theatre, bought a
banana from a nearby stand, and
walked home in a melecholy state of
mind.

Defining Washington in two words,
our correspondent feels that “political
graft" hits the situation pretty well,
As anyone who has studied geography
well knows, the territory surrounding
Washington is far from that conducive
to a lumber industry, but nEvennes
less, our correspo nt states, the
streets of the city, and particularly
Pennsylvania Avenue, are literally
iannned with political logs, blocs and
rows of stumps.

NOLLEN IS ON COMMITTEE

A ociiition of Colleges l’icks Nollell
to Serve on Committee “'orkillg
Wiﬂl Carnegie Board.

The interest of Dean J. S. Nollen and
the late Prof. Hendrixson, former
professor of chemistry, in competive
games in schools and colleges has
just come to the tangible form in the
appointment by the Carnegie Founda-
tion of Dr. Savage, of its own staff, to
investigate the present athletic situa-
tion in schools and colleges through-
out the country.

Both Mr, Nollen and lir. Hendrixson
have always had an interest in Lbe
study of competi ve games among
students And their results Several
years ago they tried at different times
to get various organizations to take
up an investigation of this sort, but
their effoits apparently did not come
to a head. Mr. Hendrixson tried to
get the Public Health Sci-vice of the
government to take up the matter, hilt
that too tailed.

Scchs hacking

Then Dean Noli’en at a meeting of
the North Association of Colleges and
Secondary Schools asked that orgrln~
' alien to go on record as being iii fa~
vor of an investigation of athletics
throughout the country. The associa-
tion appointed a committee to seek the
line ng of some large foundation to
carry on the work.

Apparently this action has had
something to do with the appintment
of Dr. Savage by the Carnegie Founda-
tion to investigate athletics,

Has ['ltle Otilcz‘ Investigations

The Carnegie Foundation has made
a number of investigations of this
character which have been almost
revolutionary in their results. A num-
ber of years ago it made an investiga-
tion into the medical schols throug -
out the country, the results of which
greatly improved the standards of ex—
isting medical colleges and did away
with a number of the weaker ones,

The American Association of Col-
leges has appointed a committee, of
which Dean Nollen is a member and
which will meet early in April, to
take action on the athletic situation
which will he in harmony with that
of the Carnegie Foundation.

To Be Impartial

The athletic situation is a question
which is brewing among all the
schools and colleges. It is hoped to
conduct these investigations as im-
partial and non-partiscii affairs, to
secure reliable data, and then follow
it up with a great deal of educational
publicity.
