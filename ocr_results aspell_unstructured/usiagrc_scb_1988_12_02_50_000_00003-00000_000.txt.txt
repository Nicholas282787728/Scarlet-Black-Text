Winners of GFL tournament
give exhibition in 8. Lounge

by John Newmark

On Monday, Nov. 28, The
Grinnell Forensics League had a
tournament among themselves in
the events of Poetry, Prose,
Dramatic Interpretation, Original
Oratory, Extemporaneous speak-
ing, and Impromptu speaking,
The winners gave an exhibition
to a group of students in South
Lounge on Wednesday. Nov. 30.

In the poetry event. Shelley
West read "America," in which
Allen Ginsberg heraies America
for everything it has done to him.
Alyssa Naumann, vvmner in the
prose category, read Garrison
Keilor's "Shy Righls Manifesto."
a manifesto demanding that the
shy people of America be given
their rights, now, or at least
sometime in the near future, or
any time at all, whenever the na-
tion feels like it.

The dramatic Interpretation,
performed by Ali Wade, was
"Rupert‘s Birthday." about a
woman who celebrated no public
works holidays, but only the
birthday of Rupert, a bullrcalf.
The woman witnessed the light
coming into Rupert's eyes when
he was born, and the light going
out when he was shot in the
head, by the butcher, before being

slaughtered. She was only 14 at
the time.

Rashmi Dyal-Chand’s
original oratory lamented the do
parlure of the visionary American
Dreams of Thomas Jefferson,
Henry David Thoreau, and Martin
Luther King, and their replace
mcnt by the materialistic dreams
of tnodern society.

All of these events were
pro-prepared. The participants
had the leisure of planning their
readings or oratories and practice
ing them for the past few weeks.
However, for the two remaining
categories, the participants had no
idea what they were going to
speak about until the night of the
tournament and the night of the
exhibition. The topics were dif-
ferent on each of these occasions.

For cxtemporaneous
speaking, Bruce Friedrich drew
his topic 30 minutes before he
had to deliver it. Monday night

at the tournament. his winning
speech was on Bush's promise of
"no new taxes." why he shouldn‘t
break it, but why he would have
to. Wednesday night he spoke
about the Education system in
America, why it was just as good

Inside the Computer
Custom Commands

by John Newmark

If you use the computer
fairly often, even if only for
writing papers, you may find
yourself typing the same come
mands over and over again. If the
commands happen to be long
ones, as some of them are, you
might desire a way to shorten
them. There is a way .. use a
login.com.

A Login.Com is a “18 that
is automatically run every time
you login. In order to set one up,
type: EDT LOGIN.COM; on the
bottom of the screen in reverse
letters will appear the words: In-
put file does not exist and [EOE]
will appear at the top of the
screen You are now ready to cre-
ate the file.

Every line must begin with
a ”".$ In order to redefine a
command, follow the $ with a
statement in the format: New—
CommandWord ' Old Com-
mands. e.g. S Runoff = Runoff
Backspace /Down=2 Pressing
PflrE will save the file,

Now, every time you lo-
gtn, the command ‘Runoff‘ will
be defined as Runoff Backspace
/Dowri=2, and you will only have
to type "Runoff filename" to
runoff your papers. To make the
command even shorter you could
include this line in your Io-
gin.com: S R ' Runoff
/Baekspace /D0wn=2

Then you would only have
to type "R filenamc" to runoff
the paper.

You can rename any come
manrl In a similar fashion, and
your login.com can be as long as

you like. Whenever you want to
add more lines just retype: EDT
login.com; add the line always
making sure it begins with a S
and follows the format New-
Command Old Command.

Here is a sample L0,
gin.com:

Dreams Mail/New
Phone
hone Answer
Show Users
3 Set Process/Name =
"CmpqusCanEFun"
8 Set prompt: "Yes Master? "

The last two lines you will
notice are different. They will set
your process name and prompt
permanently (or unLil you change
your login.com). The process
name appears whenever you type
Show Users, and unless you set
it, will be your usemame. The
Prompt is normally a 's', and ap-
pears immediately in front of the
cursor at the beginning of each
line. (Even if you redeﬁne your

as the educational systems of
other nations, but also ways that
it could be improved.

In impromptu speaking,
the top 3 contestants Monday
night competed Wednesday night
for the audience to judge. These
three contestants were Heather
Terrence, Rob Sparks, and Bruce
Friedrich. They all had a total of
6 minutes to draw 3 topics,
choose I, and give a short,
preferably humorous speech.
Heather spoke on computer geeks
and the advantages and disadvan-
tages of allowing them into
Grinnell. Rob Sparks spoke
about long underwear, how they
worked. what materials were the
best, and what colors were most
fashionable. Bruce Friedrich, the
last speaker, related modern art to
computer geeks. long underwear,
and speech activities.

After the evening was over,
CrFL President Beth Wodzmski,
announced that there were plans
for another such exhibition next
semester, as well as plans for at-
tending both a Model UN session
in February and collegiate tour-

naments at nearby colleges and
universities.

prompt, every line in your to—
gin.com still must begin with a
'3’.)

If you don't put these
commands in your login,com
you will have to type them in
every time you login. which is
certainly possible, but with a to
gin.com you don‘t have to
bother.

As I emphasized lasl issue,
if you want help setting up a lo-
gincom, or need help in doing
anything else on the computer,
there is a place for you to go, and
that is the UCs. It is their job to
help you solve any problems you
are having with the computer.
Type Show Users. and each UC
should have the letters "UC" in
their process name, along With
the telephone number of the ter-
minal room where they are. You
can call that number. and they
will be glad to help you.

The purpose of this column
is to introduce you to things that
can be done on the computer that
perhaps you didn't. know were
possible. If you don't know what
is available, you won't know the
right. questions to ask the UCs.

Thanksgiving Dinner
at Quad a success

by Kim Ecknrt

Thanksgiving break marked
the last vacation before final ex»
ams. For many, the fourrday rc~
prieve was a chance to leave
campus and visit family and
friends. But for those who
stayed, the holiday meal was
spent at Quad, and the silence,
interrupted only by televised
football, enabled some to study.

The meal was served fam-
ilyrstyle, as students were en-
couraged to arrive in groups and
were seated by a member of the
dining services Staff. Each table
received a whole turkey, and
dishes of the traditional items
such as cranberry sauce and sweet
potatoes were provided and re-
ﬁlled upon request. wine glasses
were also available for those who
brought their own wine. "We try
to plan a family-style dinner so it
makes it a little easier for those
students who can't go home,"
said Quad dining hall manager
TheresaGrier.

Most students were pleased
with the meal."Thc food was
surprisingly good, and I was im-
pressed with the atmosphere,"

said a freshman.

"It was relaxing and
friendly. The meal was enjoys
able, and it was nice to sit around
with friends and eat a traditional
meal." said a senior.

According to Grier, there
were fewer students attending the
meal this year than last year.
This year's meal count was 209,
compared with last year's 27S.

Sack snacks were provided
after the meal, complete with
bagels, cookies. fruit, and ice
cream, "We realize that the
snacks aren't a substitute for din-
ner, but we hope the treats enable
the students not to feel put out
by not being served a normal
dinner in the dining hall," said
Grier.

Aside from the meal, many
students spent the fourrday vaca-
tion relaxing. "There were
enough people here that there was
always someone to hang around
With," said one freshman.
"Although I didn‘t get anything
done, I had enough work to do,"
said another freshman,
