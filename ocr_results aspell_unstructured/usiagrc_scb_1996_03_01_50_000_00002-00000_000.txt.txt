Student places in forensics
contest, hopes to start team

BRIAN WAGNER
STAFF WRITER

Andrea Evans '98 won fourth
place in the poetic interpretation
event at a recent forensics competrr
tion and is trying to form a team
with students at Grinnellr

The tournament was held at
Cornell College in Mount Vernon.
andshe competed amongst students
from other Iowa schools, The ten—
minute presentation she gave was
an introduction and interpretation
of “21 love poems" by Adrienne
Rich, which she spent six months
preparing.

Evans explains that forensics rs
competition in the formal speech of

argumentatianprdebateand includes
events in poetic or dramatic inter—
pretation and oratory. It is one of the
few opportunities, outside athletics,
for competition with other college
students. and it provides experience
in dramatic and public speaking.

Evans competed iodwidually at
teh tournament becnus€,lll1lil(e many
othetschools, Grinnell does not have
a forensics team, Evans participated
on her high school team and now
wants to organize a team on campus
by attracting students interested in
public presentation, theatrical inter—
pretation, poetry and drama.

Grinnell's Debating Union is
active in one part of forensics, orato-
ry. but the other interests are not

represented by any current teamon
campus,

“A big reason we don't have a
team is because [students] don't get
credit," she says, Preparing for a
forensics competition is very time—
consuming, and she feels that recog—
nition with academic credits would
proyide enough motwiation forstu—
dents to participate. She looks at
varsity athletic teams and musical
groups on campus which give cred.
its and will petition the administra»
tion to consider the option.

Evam hopes to find interest
among students and organize a team
for competitions next semester, She
will also seek a faculty member to
advise the team.
