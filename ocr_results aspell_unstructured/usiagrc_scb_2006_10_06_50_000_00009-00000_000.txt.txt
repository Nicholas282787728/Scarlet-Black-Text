JOE ROSENFIELD ’25'

Letter from Joe Rosenﬁeld to EA.
Norelius, June 11, 1970

I was elected to the Board omestcc-s of the College in 1941
and since than I have devoted much of my time and wotldlv posr
sc ions to the support otthc CollegeI 71m corrstnntly rcnnnded of
my great nge hy the {act that there nre two members ofthe Bonrd
who welt not yet boln at the time I went on the Bomd. Keeping
the College uﬂout as a ﬁrst class, top ﬂight, educational institution
hus been 1| constnnt problem as the cost ofoducrition hris increased
yum utter yen Currently the Collcgc operates with an annual
deﬁcit of more than one million dollars,..'lhls gap hi been ﬁlled
in the pust only by the generous support or the tluntni and n few
individuals ofmcans who understand the importance to SOCiCl‘y of
a school like Grim llt

Now for the situation at the Collcgct I would be foolish to
my thnt the student hehnvror is pertect or that rhc Administrntion
nnd the Trustees hnven't mnde rnrstultes in judgment. I lcnow tlrnt
thete ate n small number Dfsrudcnts (very, very small) who me out
to destroy our hnsic society rrnd the College rrlong with it. But 1
urn equally ccrmln thut the overwhelming rnuioriry orstuclents ure
blight, dedicated young people who me gcl‘luincly concerned with
the tirhrrc of our socrety untl the secmlngly unsolvhble ploblcms
rurupunt in our country today, I get to the College severul tunes
4 year and have A chrtncc to talk to lots of thcmttnmd ill length.
