0 About That Flunk Day . . .

If the Scarlet and Black were representative
of student opinion, it would be up in arms
protesting the failure of the proposed
‘ “Flunk Day” yesterday. Fortunately, for
the good of Grinneli, there will be no scream—
ing editorials flaying Student Council Presi-
dent Robert C. Young, and no violent prof
tests against the triple out ruling that was
put into effect yesterday morning.

The issue involved can be studied either
from the emotional “it’s for the good of
school spirit” angle, or from the more logi-
cal viewpoint of strict ethics. It is conceded
that the Grillnell spirit of old, which has so
long been a. smoldering ember in the heart
of the school, has finally burst into flame,
and every effort should be made to keep
the fire well-kindled. It is also admitted
that the mere thought of a “Flunk Day”,
the first ill five years, appeals to the an-
archistic spirit that rests in almost every
student’s heart. This anarchism resolved it-
self into a rebellion against order and dish
cipline, and is, within reason, a normal,
healthy spirit.

Sweet as the word “anarchy" may sound,
it. has no place in an orderly existence. The

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Student Council constitution provides for
one “Victory Day” a semester. The student
body, which ratified the constitution, is in
accordance with the faculty on this ruling.
One Victory Day a. semester is a right guar—
anteed us by our constitution. When two
Victory Days are taken, students are over-
stepping their rights, and Should be kept in
line.

Our sense of what is right and what is
wrong compels us to support Young and
the administration for the stand that has
been taken.

0 . . . And Young’s Speech

Personal stock in student government should
have gone up a point or two yesterday morn;
ing when Robert C, Young, president of the
Student Council, made his now Grinnell-
famous speech that deﬂated all hopes for a
Flunk Day. For Young, although some of
his statements were entirely outeof-place,
was fundamentally right, and he exhibited
more courage, more “guts," in those few
minutes on the Alumni Recitation hall stage,
than has been seen for some time on this
campus.

Young was on the spot. He is this year’s
personification of Student Government, and
as such, had to be against the proposed
F‘lunk day. If he favored the Flunli day,
student gove‘nmcnt, as such, was out at
Grinnell. Being opposed to the day-long va-
cation, he made many enemies, but was true
to what he believed. He is to be admired
for his courage.

However, severe exceptions should be
taken to his comments about the men’s
Honor ‘G’. ’Under the supervision of Presie
dent Edward Stone, that group in the past
year has organized a recreational program
during new student days, has stimulated a
better school spi 't' at football and basket-
ball games, has inaugurated a personnel sys—
tem to aid freshman athletes in obtaining
better grades, and has paid off a debt of
several hundred dollars left over from past
years. To call these the accomplishments of
mercenal'yrmillded men is entirely false.
Furthermore, Young’s denoullcement of the
Honor ‘G’ was entirely uncalled for at the
meeting. The meeting was sponsored by inv
dividuals, and not by the organization itself.

Young ,was right in the stand he took
towards Flunk day. Stone should be come
mended in insuring the cooperation of the
Honor ’ club after the talk. The only per
sons to be censored are those who saw fit
to boo the Student Council President while
he was speaking.

Japanese Brush Drawings
Are Placed on Exhibit
In Main Hall Corridor ‘

Fifty brush drawings by the
famous Japanese artist,
Hokusai, are now on display
in the Main hall of the Quad

Hoskllsal used flowers and anir
nials as subjects for many of his
paintings, done in the chalacter-
isuc Oriental manner. He also
illustrated many fairy stories and
legends with his firm brushwork.

When he was twenty, Hokusal
went to work for a wood engi aver
and soon thought he knew more
than his master. Fired for under-
taking to change some of his
master‘s chigns, he made a vow
to become one of the greatest
painters m the world.

While he worked as a peddlel‘
at the Yedo fairs, he held the
crowds, spellbound as he drew
huge pictures on rice papci with
a bloom dipped in a bucket of

lot of personal integrity to get
up and say if. i don’t approve of
his slap at the Honor ‘G'. I
think, too, that the previous
spi it that had been generated
would have been of more
value than one day of classes."

Noumcu Fell—“He shouldn't
have said what he did about the
Honor ‘G'. rd like to defend the
club’s improvement during the
last year, and th men in it.”

Sterling Lord—I lhcughi he
had a lot of nerve, As a sort of
go~betweeli for the faculty and
sludcms, he has to think of his
position in relation, to the
faculty.”

Herschel M. Colbert, assistant
professor of journalism remark-
cd, “Since I heard only the last
portion of the talk, I can com»
mcnt only on the impression I rec
ccived from What I heard him
say. As far as his position re
garding the Honor ‘G' club is
concerned, I have no facts upon
which I could form a valid judg-
mellt When it comes, however,
to the whole idea of the flunk
day, it seems to me he had a
very Vital point from which to
argue against its propriety. That
point is:

'The student body a year ago,
by its own action agreed not to
indulge in such practices. To
break that agreement would be
in principle to do the same Sort
of tiling which Hitler has so
consistently been doing and for
which we condemn him. In short.
if we do believe in democratic
processes we must, it seems to
me, learn that one of the first
essentials is to live up to pledges
and agreements until lawful
means have been taken to change
them.“
