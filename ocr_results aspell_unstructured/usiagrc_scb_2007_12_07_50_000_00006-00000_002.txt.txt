stab: Your campaign has been a lot about
beingan outsider, bringingincliange,brirrging
in hope. What are the difﬁculties then in going
on the attack, being an aggressive candidate,
sometimes having to be negative?

I feel like we've hit the tight tone. I've got
some differences with the other candidates.
"lircy'vc never heard me get personal or gratuitous.
It’s focused on differences on the issues. You
know, it's getting tougher now in the last month
to have to respond to some silliness. one of my
competitors apparently had someone scouring my
kindergarten records.

So I want to announce to you
that this is a breaking story. I llm
disclosing all my kindergarten and
ﬁrsttgrade records, and by tomorrow
Iwill have grven everything they need
up to my first birthday.

HeraldtRegisterJ want to know
how President Barack Obama, in
January 2009, how are you going
to deploy your global vision with a
whole new crew?

Two primary goals for the next president have
to be to repair the damage Bush has done, and to
create a new approach to foreign policy. And that
involves getting our troops out of Iraq, it means
closing down Guantanamo, restoring habeas
corpus, setting an example for the world in terms
ofwhat the rule of law means, I as president will
initiate a conference with the Muslim leaders

of the entire world to talk about
4 how we can resolve the dincrcnces
, peacefully, and we all need to be
* alive to the genuine rerrorrstthreat
that’s there.

I want to then recognize that
our strength in foreign policy is
not just made by our military but
by our diplomatic eitorts. our e607
, nomic power, our cultural power. So

for example I want to double our
foreign aid, make the Millennium Development

 

Accounts America’s agenda. Build schools around ‘

the world to teach math and science instead of
hatred of America. Deal with the HIV crisis in
subtsaharan Aftica.Workwith poor countries to
encourage environmentally sound development.
’Ihere’s a whole series of steps that we could take
that will over the long term strength our security,

but also increase the ptosperltyofpcople beyond
our borders.

scab: As candidates like yourselfcampaign
across lowa, you ask people iftliey will support
you in the caucuses. If they say that they are
already committed to supporting someone else,
you ask them ifyou can be their second choice.
Since you are obvious your own ﬁrst choice for
president, who would be your second choice?

Well, that’s a tricky way of asking who my
vice president might be, or who would be there

The late Joe Biden

Biden engaged a large South Lounge

crowd for over two hours

Joe Biden’s favorite word is “literally". Literally. And his event
would have, quite literally, becn a disaster if he weren‘t so good.
Let me explain.

As well over 200 people crammed themselves into a south
Lounge initiallyiet up for so,thc campaign ruinounced thatujoe"
was late for the a pm. talk. To entertain us in his stead would be
his sister, Valerie Biden Owens.

It was, as one person said, like going over to a friend's house
when they're not home, and getting stuck talking to their mom.
At ﬁrst it’s okay. Stories ofovetcoining adversity (“It was absolute
anguish") and telling us to give her brother a look (“Joe’s just
one of the bicycles you can take to get where you want to go")
offered a sweet sense ofa younger sister supporting her sibling.
through thick and thin.

But as the minute hand began to approach seven o’clock it
steadily went downhill. Weak and vague attempts at discussing
policy were bad enough, but when she resorted to asking students
itanyone had parents in elected afﬁce,l heard a whisper behind
me of “So awkward!"

in on: last ditch effort to save a crowd that, by some miracle
had largely vmited an hour, the campaign announced they were
ordering pizza.

suddenly applause rose up as Joe Biden briskly walked into
the room. “I’m the late Joe Biden," he said with a smile as he
apologized to rhe crowd. “Don’t leave, pizzas coming."

His sister, staff and all those involved in the awkwardness
seemed to disappear.

His speech was quick and detailed and the entire audience
seemed rapt wrth attention. In less than thirtyminiites he [nan'
aged to combine rhetoric with detailed policy. He mentioned the
binary ofexper‘ience versus change. “That s the debate that the
two candidates with money talk about," he said amidst laughs.

Biden emphasized his extensive history in foreign aitairs,
his voice ranging from loud and passionate to quiet and cons
trolled. He was particularly eloquent when discussing torture.
“Tell me where it says in the gospel that torture is alright," he
thundered.

He ended his talk on a decidedly personal note the senator
told his story oflosing his wife and infant daughter at 29, leaving
him a single paicnr, and his recent health problems.

And then came the single most impressive part—more than
niacty minutes of questions. People ranged from broad ques-
tions on why Republicans should vote Biden to details on rhc
Blackvmter scandals.

when the pizza arrived, Valerie magically materi ized to
tell Biden to let us eat. ‘I ll tell you what I ll do," he said
dont want anyone to think I won‘t answer their question, so .1 1}
stay here.”

yBiden took his time with each answer, at one point going on
a four minute tangent on ﬁssile material before addressing the
question on global warming. Normally when a politician goes
on a tangent, they get lost,or use it to avoid the actual question
But Biden just seemed eager to tell his audience the breadth of
the issues.

Finally, at close to 9: 30 1) ni he told everyone he had to go.
His sister and his sraffrcaplpearcd suddenly and he asked them
ifthcre was anv piz lctt. When he heard no, he shrugged to
the crowd. “Thats what happens when you hwc eight million
dollars instead of 100 million dollars,"hc said.

But Monday night, despite initial hiccups, rhc audience for»
got about Biden‘s long—shot status and lack of funds and found
themselves in a tcill conversation with a presidential nominee.

stair: One oftlio things we see in the world today is that a lor

the same countries that are either authoritarian right now or
heading in an authoritarian direction. As president, how would
you deal with those countries that are on one hand vital to our
national interest, biit on the other hand are heading away from
democracy, human rights and personal liberties?

Absolutely But look ultimately, the truth is that ifit comes
down to human rights and our physical security, the ﬁlst job rhe

question to be asked today would be ify oil would have, as ptesiden
in 1941 ioirrcd with Joseph Stalin to take down Adolintler.The
answer is yes, but Joseph Stalin killed 20 million people. He did
not in fact do anything to promote human rights in Russia. But
the truth otthc war was, the most immediate threat to our physical
securitywas N. . Germany. so we made a very drifrculr choice. but
the right choice.

 

Biden: 1 would do it by making clear that to the extent
that they wanted our cooperation and our involvement, it
would depend on their treatment oftheir citizens with
basic human rights. But one of the problems we have
is that in order to be able to inﬂuence Russia. we need
to convince the Europeans to join us to put collective
pressure on Russia to move toward democracy. But we
