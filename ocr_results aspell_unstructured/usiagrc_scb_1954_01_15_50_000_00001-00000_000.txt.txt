Final Paymen’r
For Cyclones
Due Jan. 22

January 22, is the final dead-
line for the additional $1.25
payments for the Cyclone. Any-
one who has not paid, or who
has not arranged to pay the
sum. will forfeit his previous
,payment or two dollars. “There
will be no exceptions,” stated
Ed Ling, business manager of
the yearbook.

Ling further said that the Cy-
clone staff is very sorry that
the extra amount is necessary
and must be paid by January
22. Previously the deadline for
all payments was January 30,
with the amount raised to $1: 0
for payments nicer January 22,
Now it is just $1.25, but the
earlier date is the final day. The
date of the deadline was set as
such he commented, because
students have money after va—
cation and because those who
are mployed on campus are
[paid in the middle of the month.

Ling added that the annual
must have a deﬁnite number
of books in its contract with
[the printer. No extra copies
will he ordered except the 25
anticipated for new students
:1!an Griunell during the
sewndl semester.

The payments to the printer
must be in by February 1, so
that the Cyclone can get a two
percent discount ﬁrm-n the cost
of printing. The discount will
add up to almost enough to
pay for priming a four-
oolor photograph in the book,
commented the business mana~
ger.

This picture, an autumn scene
of central campus including
Blair hell, is planned for the
first page of the introductory
part of the annual. To print the
color photograph costs $250.

Lil-lg stated, “Every little bit
that we can add to the amount
to pay for it, counts. We cer—
tainly would like to use that
picture,"

So far, 324 people have paid
the 5125; 45 students have
not suscribed at all;‘ and four
have decided not to pay the
additional sum.

The Cyclone this year has
sold over 100 copies. According
to Ling, that is more than any
year since right after World
War ll when there were about
400 more students at Grinnell.

The Cyclone office will be
open from 3—5 p. In. every day
except Saturday and: Sunday.

éw 'Dean

A special committee of the
faculty, which will aid the
Board of Trustees in the selec-
tion of the new Dean of the
College, are sendm' lg notices to
all faculty members asking them
to submit names of persons
whom they would like 00 have
contacted regarding the post.

This action was made neees<
sary after Dean of the College
Max Fuller announced his Te-
signation at the special faculty
meeting, saying he was taking
a position as Director of Field
Education for the Maytag Dolm-
puny in Newton.

The chairman of the advisory
group, which was elected by the
faculty in a special faculty
meeting January 7, is fonner
Dean of the College Earl D4
Strong (economics). strong
stated that the notices also re-
quested all available informa—
tion on suggested names which
individual faculty members
might be able to provide.

other members of the 00m”
mines: are Homer Nomn (his
tory). who was elected acting
Dean of the College lby the
faculty at the ,special meeting;
George Lovell (psychology) and
James Stauss (economics). NOI-
ton said' that the group hope to
meet with the Board of Trust-
ees' ‘committee ,on instruction
when the Trustees meet here
January 29,

President Samuel N. Stevens
departed from normal procedure
in having the faculty elect the
acting dean; usually he would
appoint a temporary successor.
In the faculty’s selection, both
Lovell and Norton were on the
first ballot and Norton elected
on the second.

Norton is also chainman of
the faculty. and will act in
both Capacities until the regular
change in faculty offices this
spring.

Commenting on his resigna-
tion, Fuller stated, “1 have very
great affection for Grinnell col-
lege. My interests lie both pro-
fessionally and personally in
education. However, it seems
from my own personal point of
View what now that greater orp-
> portunities are being offered in
the industrial training program
than in the field of education, it
is time to move in another di—
rection.”

MT. Fuller has been associated
with the training program at
Maytag since October. 1950.
When the company expanded
the program, creating the need
for a fulltime manager, mler
accepted the opportunity.

“I accepted the position after
discussing the matter with Dr.
Stevens and' others whose judg—
ment ‘1 value. There cannot be
the slightest implication that I
am in any way dissatisfied with
the college p ogram"

Acting Dea Norton comment-
ed, “1 went to a special faculty
meeting not knowing what it
was all about, and walked out
the Dean of the College, What
a surprise!”

He stated that the (acuity
icolmmittee lie heads Will select
lpossi le candidates fmm- names
submitted by any authoritative
‘soun‘ce, but he believes that the
dean dhosen should be someone
with distinction in the liberal
arts ﬁeld and who has had ex-
perience in a liberal arts col-
lege.
