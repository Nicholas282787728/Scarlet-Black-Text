HISTORY OF BIBLE TRACED

Rev. Mr. Dana Gives History of
Bible at Joint ‘ ‘3!" Meeting:

Rev. Mr. Dana of totumwa gave a
vc rapid but interesting revlew of
“Where We Got Our Bible," at a joint
meeting or the Y. M and Y. w. U. A
Thursday evening

Stertopticnn views or many old
manuscripts and historical places were
very Ilclpltll in tracing the develop»
merit ol the Billie, but owing to lack ol
Lillie, Rev. Dana. was nimble to do jllS'
ties to his suhiecl. He traced the his.
tory ot the Bible, in. substance, as Tolr
lows:

“in the earliest time=, the Life and
Teachings or Jesus Christ were givcn
orally but by $20, gave place to wl
ten accounts. In the iourth century
many old Greek manuscripts were coir
lected and made into the New Tesm~
ment in ditiereut colors and languages.
Later more manuscripts were found,
hilt none of the New Testaments writ
to“ were wholly complete.

Next thu Syrian, Egyptian and
Roman versions were found, and sup
posed to he the original words that
Jesus used. They were all old Latin
lorins, translations direct from the
Greek. Tho Vulgate vcrsion by St.
Jerome then hecame the accepted ver-
sin“ oi‘ the Catholic church. Then crane
Caedmon's "Farrphrases oi the labile,"
and from thence to Bede's translation.

Alter the Nolmmi Conquest, we have
the ﬁr.t English translation I .lnhn
xvi lllt' The invention ol printing
just at this time nus a most important
factor, and the developmental the Blhle
can be traced rapidly to King lames‘
rel IDIT, lrolu that to the Rethcd \el'r
slou or TSSI, and Then to our Twcnrirth
Century lillllv."
