Prospei-ity Returning

"The country is now going into
a state of apparent prospel’ityi
for three-fourths of the people, but
we still have 9,000,000 unemployed,
and this unemployment will cone
tinue even if production reaches
the 1929 level. There is now great-
er efficiency, and if this condition

continues to operate, there will he,

15 or 20 millions unemployed in
another generation,” he pointed
out.

“We have now reached a new
place in history where society can

no longer be run in the same wsy.‘

In the past we have built society
and we now have the new and dif-
ferent job of organizing it. We
must see our needs and purposes

them."

Deiinos Depression

In commenting on the depreSr
sion, the assistant secretary of ag-
riculture deﬁned a depression as a
disparity in price relationships. Ina
dustry and agriculture have been
out of harmony since 1921 or 1922,
and the present problem is to de-
crease agricultural output and in-
crease agriculturai prices, while
we increase industl‘ialloutput and
lower industrial prices.

“The AAA and the greatest
idl‘ollght in our history have gone
'a long way toward bringing about
’the needed adjustment in agricule
‘ture, but little has been done in
an industrial way,” he stated,
