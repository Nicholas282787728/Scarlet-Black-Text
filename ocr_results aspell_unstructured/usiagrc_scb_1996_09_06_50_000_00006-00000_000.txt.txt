After informal competition against
other Iowa colleges last Saturday, the
Grinnell College women‘s tennis
team is set to begin its campaign this
Wednesday at Central.

Saturday the netwomen travel to
Cornell for their Midwest Confer
ence opener. In 1995 the Pioneers
managed only one dualrmcct victory,
but still finished ninth out of 12
teams at the conference champion
ships.

Second-year coach David
Arseneualt is upbeat about his squad,
The Pioneers have a number of rock—
ies and five veterans vying for play-
ing time, “I do not have my lineup
set, but itlooks like ourNo. 1 singles

player from last season may be No.
4 this year. Anytime you can put
three new players in at the top, you
have to feel good about the strength
of your team," commented Coach
Arsenault.

Rookies Amy Kaufman and Aime
Hopper are battling for the No, 1
singles posnion. Their classmate,
Beth Dadko, is slated for No.3 while
1995 top Singles player Kim Knous
will slide in at No. 4. Jeanie
Mackenzie, who played No. 2 last
season, is tabbed as the No. 5 player
and another rcturnee, Cynthia
Robbins, should play No. 6. Coach
Arsencault noted that veteran pluy-
ers Ryun Jun and Danya Lccbaw are
waiting in the wings ready to play if
needed.

“Everybody realizes we have a

good chance to be competitive this
year," offered the coach, “There is a
lot of competition within the squad
so I think we’ll definitely improve
during practice."

Last weekend Arseneault tried four
doublescombinatioiis at the Iowa fun
doubles meet. Kaufman and Dadko
posted a2-l mark at No. l. Knoiis
and Mackenzie were 1-3 at No. 2,
but because they won their first
match they competed in the champi-
onship ﬂight, Robbins and Hopper
posted a 2-1 mark at No.3 while Jun
and Leebaw were 13 at No. 4.

“I saw a couple things last Saturr
day. First. I think our ﬁrst-year play~
ers were nervous. Second, I think
we’ll havcastrong singles lineup but
we’ll need to improve our doubles
play," said Arseneault.

After traveling 3000miles the Grinr
nell College football team will open
its 1996 schedule this Saturday at
Pomona College in California. The
game marks the ﬁrst meeting of the
two teams,

“We think this will be a great game
between two schools which place an
emphasis on academics. Pomona is
coming off a 6-3 season in 1995 so
we'll deﬁnitely have to play well to
succeed," commented coach Greg
Wallace.

. With 17 starters returning from last
year’s squad the Pioneers hope good
fortunes will come. The Pioneers
strive to break a string of nonrwina
ning seasons which dates back to
1970. “This is could be the year we
snap the streak," commented coach
Wallace, now in his eiglilh year as

head coach.

Despite ﬁghting small squad numr
bers thc Grinnell gridders put to»
gather the best back-to-back cani-
paigns in 25 years with 45 records
in 1994 and 95 “We have made
great progress over the past two
years. Now we want to take the next
step," said Wallace.

The Pioneers flice li tougher sched-
ule in 1996 with the addition of
Pomona and the top two teams from
the Midwest Conference north divi—
sion, Belott and Ripon. Wallace
noted, “There is no doubt that we
have our work cut out for us. [think
everyone on the conference schcdr
tile is going to be good this season."

On offense the Pioneers only have
to till one hole at running back and
for the ﬁrst time in his tenure Wallace
has the entire offensive line returnr
ing. “Over the last few years we've
actually played more physical than

our opponents at times. That used
to be unusual,” assessed Wallace.

Sophomore quarterback John Hunt
has a trio of tremendous receivers
returning as targets. Prerscason Alla
American Kafclc Hodari holds the
Grinncllrecotd forcarecrrcccptions
with 122 . Tlglit end Jacob Boyer
and flanker Richard Werner offer size
and speed to the combination.

In 1995 the Pioneers presented a
rushing attack which showed a lot of
progress. As ateam Grinnell rushed
for 1,629 yards. The wealth was
spread among a host ofbacks includ-
ing leading rusher Eric Ricnsche,
who is a pro-season Academic Alla
American. He totaled 525 yards on
103 attempts. Three other, backs,
Wade Krause, Wemer and Jim Hart,
all rushed for over 300 yards. “The
ability to run the ball gives us a
chance to control the game," said
Wallace,

 

MEN S SOCCER

As the Grinnell College men's seer
cer team prepares for another excit~
ing season, it ﬁnds itself in the cne
viable position as favorite in the Mid
west Conference title race. Under the
leadership of longrtime coach John
Pfitsch the Pioneers have been a
powerhouse m the MWC, capturing
two consecutive championships in
1993-94 while ﬁnishing second last
year. However, if Pfitsch's squad
hopes to continue its current success
streak it will need to overcome some
difﬁcult challenges on both offense
and defense. The Pioneers must re-
place Neil Goodspeed, a graduate
last year, who was one of the most
proliﬁc scorers in school history. in
addition, the team will once again
confront some stiff conference com-
petition.

In Sunday's alumni game (see
photo above), Grinnell rose to the
challenge and erased any doubt about
the Pioneers’ returning talent.
Against the alumni team, which in
cluded some of the best players to
graduate from Grinncll, the Pioneers
started off slow but came on strong
in the critical latter stages.

Alum Tom McCullcn, now the var»
sity assistant coach. struck first with
a free kick goal midway through the
first half to put the alumni up 1-0.
The younger Pioneers then answered
with a goal late in the ﬁrst'half to
knot the score.

For much of the second half, the
teams seersawed back and forth un-
til late in match when newcomer
Jeremiah Garza broke the game open
with an impressive header to give the
Pioneers the ﬁnal 2-1 advantage. At
the end of the match, the alumni pre
sented Coach Pfitsch with a trophy

that bore his name. The Pﬁtsch cup
will be presented to all future win.
ners ofthe annual alumni game.

Though the game did not count as
a regular season victory, it served as
the first indicator ofPioneer skills in
actual competition. Although
pleased with the Victory and the tal-
ent level on his squad, Coach Pﬁtsch
remains concerned about his team‘s
“mcdiocre” performance to begin the
season.

Pfitsch remarked, “I'm always dis-
appointed with the ﬁrst game of the
year and this was no exception. But
he added, “I‘m optimistic that we
will get some problems ironed out
and have a solid team.“ Judging by
past performances and the level of
returning talent, this appears to be an
understatement. With any luck, the
Pioneers promise to be in the thick
of the hunt for the MWC champion-
ship at the end of the season.

With its season opening match
merely four days away, the Grinnell
College women’s soccer team is exr
cited, composed and conﬁdent that
it is on the brink of yet another sucr
cessful season.

In the past, the Pioneers have
proved to be a dire force to their ope
ponents, winning the southern divie
sion the past six years and picking
up four consecutive Midwest Con»
ference championship titles from
1990-93. Therefore, it should come
as no surprise that the Pioneers are
once again expected to be in the hunt
for the MWC title. Coach Jenny
Wood is unquestionably looking for
ward to the team's ﬁrst two contests

Defensively the Pioneers return six
starters from a unit which provided
emotional leadership for the 1995
team. “If we can get the same per»
formance from our defense again this
season, we’ll be in every ball game,”
said Wallace,

Along with Werner and Grinnell‘s
return teams, Wallace welcomes

back sophomore punter and kicker-

Staii Banks, “Stan stepped in last
year and performed quite well in
some pressure-filled situations. I
think our kicking game is only go
ing to get better and better this fall."
said the coach.

“There is a lot for us to look for
ward to in the 1996 season. Not only
do we want to have a winning sca-
son. we also cxpccl to move up in
the conference standings. Hopefully
our experience will fuel our efforts,"
said Wallace.

Sport: In formation

This Saturday at Cornell's two-
mile Ram Run the Grinnell College
women's cross country runners be-
gin a journey which they hope will
lead them to an unprecedented sixth
consecutive Midwest Conference
championship. Defending the title
may be a formidable task aftcr los-
ing a national qualifier in Stephanie

Hitztaler and point-getting seniors
Erin O'Fallon, Holly Pfitsch and Ally
Beckman.

When confronted Wltll this (its
leinina, Coach Evelyn Freeman comr
merited, “i see great potential with
this group. Half oi our team con.
sists of first—year students, transfers
and four older students that are come
peling for the first time, This makes
us a team starting from scratch, but
our returnees have worked hard and

l have seen potential in the neweoinr
ers,” commented Freeman, As in
years past, Freeman and “potential"
have become great partners and a
roster that includes 24 runners (1] re»
turnces and 13 newcomers) makes a
good bet for a competitive season.
In a break from tradition the Pior
nccrs ran in the Happy Days 5k held
in Grinnell last Saturday. In the lor
cal 5k Becca chel was first for the
Pioneerswlth a time of 19:57 and

Razel Mueller and Geny Reistcr fol-
lowed in 20:10 and 20:39 respec-
tivcly. Transfer-student Claire Pirkle
led all newcomers (20:39), “It was a
solid group effort," added Freeman.
Asked for a season prognosis Free-
man replied, “It is a long season. Nev-
crthclcss, we wxll wait and see how
things develop. [am pleased that our
runners did what they were supposed
to do with summer conditioning, so
hopefully we will stay healthy."

this Saturday and Sunday at Illinoxs
College and Knox,

Last Sunday Wood was able to get
_a good idea ofhow the team will per-‘
form against competition as the Pio-
neer kickers took on their predeces-
sors in the annual alumni scrimmage.
Although the Pioneers lost the
matchup, 3-2, Wood commented that
the game allowed the coaches to
evaluate different groups together
and get a better feel for what things
need improvement,

“We were able to play all of the
members on the team and it was ex-
tremely helpful to see what this
group is capable of achieving," said
Wood. “We have 29 people and the
coaches are working hard to estab

lish a role for each and every per- ,

son. Our team is excited about our

schedule and has as its goal to play
, our best at the end of the season,”
At this point, however, the team
must focus on performing well at the
beginning as Illinois College is an
opponent that is improving every
time it steps onto the ﬁeld, suggested
Wood. ”We will need to be sharp
and ready for them, “ she noted.
Wood also lauded the Knox Prairie
Fire, saying they are always ready to
defend their home turf. “This game
will be a good indicator of how pre-
pared we are to to face physical and
mental challenges," she stated.
According to Wood, Ihe~team has
been practicing with intensity and
desire she hopes will be carried over
into games. “Wejust need to get out
onto the ﬁeld and play at the level
we are capable of," said Wood.

ing from the 1995 Midwest Conference
championship team, the Grinnell Col.
lege cross country squad has high cx—
pcclations for 1996. The Pioneers hit
the road this Saturday at the Cornell
Ram Run.

Freeman. “1 think everyone needs to
compete." The Ram Run Is at’ourmile

8K cross counLry distance.

With the addition offour rookies to an
already strong team, the Grinnell llan’ir
ers seem deeper this fall than in 1995,

runners and then we have about 10 guys
who will vie for opportunities in the
second group," said Freeman.

tials. Other reluming ninncrs with solid
