DID YOU!

Did you do anything for Grillneli
during the Christmas Vacation? Did
you speak to that high school friend
who will go to some college next
year?

If you did, you were working for a

 

bigger and a better Gl‘innell. For

Within certain limits, "bigger”

even more healthy spirit on the calm
pus, More men and women of spear
ial abilities would be on hand for the
forensic, musical, and dramatic or
ganizations. More capable executives,
more leaders, workers._

No one would be called upon to
head a number of organizations nor to
dilute his efforts among even
greater number of activities.

if you did not put forth any effort
to bring more students to Grinnell,
you passed up a great opportunity to
help Grinneii. Don't neglect this op-i
portunity during the rest of the year.

Although the spring and summer
vacations seem a long way off, it is
not too early to begin laying plans to
make a few Griunell converts during
those weeks and months that you will
be home again.

MIL WEST AND THE COLONIAL
Mr. 1-,. c. West, manager of the Col-

onial theatre seems to be making quite
a success out of that institution which
for several years was classed as some-
what of a white elephant. And what
is more commendable, he seems to he
ahl to make it pay and at the same
time lets Grinnell taste of the best
frequently

i

Bringing “The Covered Wagon" and
“The Cat and the Canary” to Grill-I
nell on consecutive nights sets a new
record for high class dramatic pro-
ductions here. And now comes word
that “Blossom Time," and “Going Up”
are coming. ,

HOT WATER

With all llue consideration to the
mechanical difficulties involved, it
seems to us that hot water could he
more regularly delivered to the Men's
halls. Frequent telephone calls '0
the heating plant have sometimes fli-
fol‘ded temporary relief.

The pioneers of old may not have

indulged themselves in hot water, and
the dormitory residents of today per-

But it
certainly is vely convenient at times,
and a regular supply of this modern
luxury would he very much appreciat-
ed by all those who find it necessary
to bathe or shave.
