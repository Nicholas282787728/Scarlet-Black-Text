Turley. “His outstanding culinary skills are complemented by

Coburn, Goto recovering from car accident

Eliza Coburn '08 watched the world go by from waist-level
in Three Crows on River Street, her mother’s restaurant in
Delano,Minnesora.

Yuki Goto ’08 strummed a guitar from his hospital bed in
the Younker Rehabilitation Center in Des Moines.

Nearly six weeks after their car rolled oftthc highway outr
side Iowa City, ﬂinging them both through the back window,
Coburn and Goto work towards recovery.

Jelal Younes '08 and Demetrio Rojas Aguilera '08, also in
the cat, were not seriously injured. Younes, the driver, fell asleep
at the wheel. His drug tests came back negative and he was
fined for losing control ofthe car.

The February 23 accident landed Coburn in the hospital
for 23 days. After four surgeries to reconstruct her legs with
metal rods and a skin graft on her knee, she returned home
to Minnesota.’l‘hough wheelchair bound, she expects to begin
rehabilitation in a few weeks once her legs have healed. Doctors
will not know the length of rehabilitation until she begins.

In the wcelts before therapy begins, Coburn's mother pushcs
her daughter in a wheelchair from their house down the road
to the restaurant each morning. “I’m doing pretty well not do—
ing much,“ said Coburn.“For how bad [the injury] is, it‘s being
equalized by a fairly easy recovery."

Goto will remain in the rehabilitation center while he ran

how to identify date rape drugs. “A lot of students operate with
the assumption that all Grinnellians are good people and it’s
good [to feel comfortable] but it can be dangerous sometimes,"
she said.

According to Polivy, this sense of safety shows students
widespread assumptions that Grinnell is crimErfree. "People
talk about it for a week or two [about dangers] and people as-
sume it’s all taken care of," she said.

Bruckner said, “Drunken hookups are a common enough
thing [that] Idon’t think people make much of [date rape drug
symptomsl,” She said.

Bruckner wants to see more students realize that in Grinnell
“because we all know each other it's really hard to imagine
somebody you know would do that to you, but obviously some~
one has," she said.

covers from a head injury. According to a statement released
by his mother, Kaori Goto, “He remains quite conhiscd and
disoriented but is very gradually getting back his memories of
Gtinnell and his friends."The medical staff has prohibited non—
family visitors and phone calls during this stage of recovery.

Cobutn hopes to return to Grinnell in the fall without a
wheelchair. The metal rods in her legs should not interfere with
her mobility and doctors do not think she will have a limp after
her skin graft heals. “I have a lot of hardware in me now,” she
said. “In up to two years I’ll be back to normal.”

She found that, for now, being disabled is personally rer
warding. After taking a medical anthropology course that fo-
cused on disability in the fall, she is now living the type oflifc
she studied. “People look at you," she said. “They are quick to
help you...they don't know what you are capable of." Though
people state from their cars as she rolls to the restaurant, she
said she appreciates her new point-of-view and is considering
majoring in anthropology with a focus on mcdicinc.

Coburn is beginning to miss Grinnell as boredom sets in.
She hoped Goto will also return to school before his friends
graduate. Friends can track Goto‘s progress at http://web.
