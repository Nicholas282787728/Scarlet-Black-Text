AN EDITORIAL

The step taken by the faculty
committee on athletics in asking
that Grinnell be allowed to with-
draw from the Missouri Valley
conference will undoubtedly in<
voke the cry that by doing so
we have admitted our inferiority.

We believe that the action is

on the contrary a sensible ad-
mission that we have been play—
ing out of our class.

Thst even this admission is
hard medicine to Swallow is ob-
vious. Yet sane contemplation
brings the realization that it is
the wise thing to do.

The spirit and morale of the
school and the teams will be
improved by the more even com»
petition which will result in a
conference of schools comparable
to ours in size. This wholesome
effect will in our opinion more
than ofrset the depression effect
of dropping out of the valley.

PETITION FOR WITHDRAWAL
FROM MISSOURI VALLEY

I am authorized by the president and the faculty committee on

when Prof. Earl D. Strong,

:1 member of the faculty

athletic committee, and executive secretary of the con-

Lerence faculty committee, presented a petition to the:

conference body in their meeting at Kansas City, asking
that Gl'innell be allowed to drop from the conference

after the 1988-39 season.

i l
The petition was approved by the Gi‘innell athletic com-‘

mittee at ft meeting called by Pres. John S. Nollen Wedr

nesday. Coaches .
participated in the meeting,
at which those in attendance
voted unanimously for the
change, but Prof. Paul Spen-
cer Wood, a long-time mem»
ber of the committee, was,
absent from the meeting when
the vote was held. Wood,
reached by long distance tele-
phone at Iowa City early satur»
day, stated that he stood wrth the
committee. Members of the com-
mittee which voted for the change
include Nollen, Coach John Trues»
dalc, Strong, Prof. Leo P. Sherr
man, Wood, and Prof. Joseph
w. Charlton,
Strong Authorized.

The petition stated that strong
had been authorized by the presi-
dent and faculty committee on
athletics of Grinneil college to
ask withdrawal as ,of June I,
1939. It was declared that an
interim of 13 months before with-
drawal was desirable since Grin»
neil had entered into certain
obligations with conference memrl
hers, including a 1538 football
schedule, which were undertaken
with the understanding that Grin-
nell would he a Valley member.
and which committments the col-
lege wished to respect. it was
also stated that the interim would
give the college and conference a
chance to make resdjustments.

Six Reasons.

The petition stated that with-
drawal was asked for six rea-
sons, arrived at with “very care-
ful consideration." The reasons
given are:

1.Grinnell has never been
successful in conference
football 7 the dominant
sport.

2. Grinnell's success in other
lines of sport has been

only fair,

3. With but one exception. the
number of students and
potential athletes at other
conference schools very
greatly exceeds the number
at Grinnell.

4. Grinneli has a very smell

student body and is locat—
ed in s very smeu town.

HISTiORY

14th of This Month Marks
19 Years in Calif ence

Valley conference just 15 years
ago the 14th of this month. At
that time the conference was
composed of Nebraska, Missouri.

athletics of Grinnell to inform the M'mouri valley conference that Members of the
Grinnell will withdraw from the conference, and wishes June 1, 1939iI
to be set as the effective date of Withdrawal.

An interim of 18 months before the actual retirement has been
fixed as desirable for the following reasons:

idemtion.

man of the faculty committee,

1. it win give the conference tmd Grinnell ample time for
u readjustment of their affairs.

2. Certain obligations have been entered into between vari-

ous members of the conference and Grinneil under the
assumption that Grinnell would be a member of the con-
ference, and Grinnell wishes on respect all such commit-
rments.
Since the above obligations include the participation of
Grlnnell in a conference football schedule in 1933, it
seems proper that Grinneu should continue to partici-
pate in an conference sports during the yem‘ 1933-39.

Grumell has not come to this decision without very cal-end con-
It would set forth the following facts as logically lead-‘ in
ing to the decision that has been made:

i. Grinnell has never been successful in conference foot
ball—the dominant sport. it has played many good
games, but has seldom been able to win. This failure
to win a reasonable number of oonicrenoe victories has
been unsatisfactory to Grinnell tennis and student body
and has prevented its teams from being desirable or-
truetions at other member institutions.

Grinneil‘s success in other lines of sport has been only
fair. The same urgumcnt applies here as to football,
but with less emphasis.

With but one exception, the number of students and po<
iontlni athletes at other conference institutions very
greatly exceeds the number at Grinnell. This discrepancy
in numbers and athletic power could be equalized only
by means of n. great campaign of recruiting and sub-
sicl .ing by Grumeli, This college is unwilling to under-
mke such an activity.

Grinneil has a small student and alumni body and is
located in a very small town. It can never offer at~
triwtive flnnnclnl inducements to other conference teams.
This fact together with others, renders schodulemulriug
very difficult.

The distances between Grinneil and the other con-
ference institutions is, in most cases, very considerable.
Trni-eling expenses, both for Grinncll and for visiting
teams, are, therefore, heavy.

Grinnell is playing outside of her class, as regards
athletics. There is no reason to believe that she wﬂl
ever be athletically equal to most of the other members
it seems wise, therefore, not to attempt to continue
longer an undesirable sitamtion.

Grinnell's withdrawal from the
Missouri Valley Conference
which was announced Friday a!»
'ternoon at a conference meeting
in Kansas City, as follows:

rresident John s. Nation: “1
have felt for a long time that
our relations with the Missouri
Valley conference were un-
satisfactory. both to us end to
other members of the conference.
For instance, there have been
lgreat difficulties in making
schedules. which have resulted
very few home confer-
, games." (The pioneers
iplnyed only one conference game
lat Grinnell this yeariwith st.
Louis university, in the home-
,coming tilt, Nov. 20.)

Prof. Leo P. Sherman: “I have
always thought that Grinnell
was playing outside of its class.
We have around 400 men enroll-
ed here, and, when the fresh-
men are subtracted. that leaves
less than sun from which to
draw football material. This
-pnts us in the same class- with
only one other conference school
7Washburn.

“It seems to me that we have

been bucking great odds year
iafter year, and it has hurt me
to see the boys go against teams,
which, because of size, weight
and other factors. it was unfair
‘for them to go against. In the
lions run the college will be bet
ter off by withdrawal from the
rconference."
Prof. Joseph \V. Charlton: “I
’have felt for some time that
Grinnell will be better off play-
ing institutions of its own type.
I feel that it is hard on the mor-
ale of the school to sustain as
many defeats as we have receiv-
ed in football."

Prof. Paul Spender Wood: The
committee was definitely of the
-opinion that it would gain by
withdrawal from the Missouri
Valley conference. it was of the
opinion that Grinneil does not
belong in the conference. We
will be better off to break them.
I stand with the committee.”
