In queer blood: crossing America’ s heartland MlllllETlMEs

ansamer ca

Too many people will see Tl'ﬂmnmr
ert‘m expecting the cheeky, decked—out
camp or wild and raunchy surrealism
that usually dominate the transveSt
tic genre. Tl'am/Imerim offers neither,
thankfully. In fact, its moments of com-
edy become jarring because they are so
clearly intertwined with the sadness
and frustration of Felicity Huffmans
character. Similarly, its moments of
surrealism are imbued with a sincerity
and depth that most surrealism would
shun.

Felicity Huffman's performance is
a well—crafted and ethical portrait of a
transgendered person, Bree, coming to
grips with the fact that he/she cannot
abandon the past in favor of a better
and brighter future and gender. sadly
for Bree,just saying, “it barely counted
as a relationship" or “my family is dead"
does not cause her sons, sisters, fathers
and mothers to disappear into the air.

Felicity Huffman—as well as the
rest of the cast—do .l bang-up job of
bringing a tough and interesting story
to life. They ﬁnd a way in which trans-
gender people, child abusers, Cherokee
sheep ranchers, Arizona country clubs
bets and lcvcer vegans might all cont
ceivably inhabit the same tiny galaxy

Some critics would describe this
movie as just having a “transgender
message," but a powerful visual and
narrative eloquence and elegance bring
poignancy and interest to the movie.
Tmnrzzmlrim could too easily have
washed into a politically correct “we
should accept everyone for who they
are" message.

Instead, Tmmamerim has a classical
American poignancy in the lines of the
great hcrotloscrs like Michael Douglas
in Wandert'ayr, Yank in O’Nell's The
Hairy/1pc, Jon voigt in Midnigbt Carrie
soy, or perhaps even Hedwig in John
Cameron Mitchell's own famous transr
gender voyage.

What separates Tmmamerim from
these movies in general and Hedwig in
particular is the character’s reﬁlsal to

attempt greatness. Biee/Steven has no
interest in being a rock star, a famous
novelist or even an idyllic Mamet
mantape. Bree just wants to live her
life and achieve a happiness denied to
her since before she was born.

No doubt politics burn at the core
of this story of ajourney across Amer
ica, but it is not a politics of meek ac-
ceptance. It is the politics surrounding
one person's pursuit of happiness, a
central right to the American way of
life.

7 David DeGeel/

The film is called Capote. But it
could be Clare Encounter: qftbe Mide
werrem Kind. Part of the attraction of
the film is its fisheouteofrwatcr story.
Here we have a New York City intels
lectual, a writer for The New Yln'kll' no
less, and the way he interacts with a
tight-knit Midwestern town that we
expect to be cold and forbidding is fast
cinating. .

. But if there is humor in this tale,
the story continually tries to undercut
it by trying to move towards a vision
of the famous author beyond the mere
eccentric he is usually portrayed to be.
Capote capitalizes on his difference,
manipulating his own behavior in order
to manipulate the reactions of others
7 all with the noble aim of trying to
capture the scoop of the century.

As a film, Capote is far more cone
cerned with the ramiﬁcations of this
large drama of character than it is in the
details of the grisly smallatown murder
that provoked Truman Capote to leave
his plush New York writer lifestyle, set
up camp in a Midwest motel and write
his groundbreaking investigative jour-
nalism book In Cold Blood.

We spend time getting to knowTru-
man, following along as he shmoozes
with New York literati and travels with
Harper Lee. We watch as he bribes his
way into a prison in order to develop
a manipulative friendship with the two
murderers who will become central to
the story he feels compelled to write.

As he ventures further into this
world, however, the situation becomes
more morally ambiguous, as he is une
able to simply act as an objective obs
serverr

in attempting to tell this deeply
psychological tale, where tension ex-
ists not due to the physical crisis ofthe
gruesome murders but rather due to
crises of friendship and trust, the ﬁlm’s
ambition occasionally exceeds its abil—
ity to express that ambition,

However, tangential elements “1’
terfere, and the film at times loses its
grip on what makes it really work: the

goal that Capote has in mind and the
emotionally manipulative measures he
uses to achieve that goal. Phillip Sey-
mour Hoffman performs admirably,
assisting the project through his ability
to project this sense of a conﬂicted pm,

supporting cast.

overall, this is an emotionally com
