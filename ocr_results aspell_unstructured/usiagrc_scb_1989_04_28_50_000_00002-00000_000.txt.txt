dents will help them have a better
grasp of the language.“ She has
past experience Leaching English
to Japanese and Cambodian chil-
dren. Matthews also expressed an
interest in learning to compare
Chinese and American cultures.

The two students will keep
journals of their experiences. and
after completing the program in
June, 1990, they will return to
discuss their experiences with the
college community.

Neither student is certain
what role the Nanjing fellowship
will play in her future plans.
Matthews plans to pursue a grad-
uate degree in anthropology,
possibly in linguistics, but not
necessarily connected with Chi-
nese. Chat, who has been ace
cepted this summer as an
Associated Press Minority lntem,
is considering a career in journal-
ism. Despite their career plans,
both see the Nanjing fellowship
as great cxpericncc.

SACC releases
computer survey

by Diane Gumz

By keeping informed about
student needs rind opinions
regarding computing, the Student
Academic Computing Committee
can suggest changes and imr
provcments to the system that
might not otherwise receive due
consideration. SACC serves as a
liaison between Computer Ser-
vices and students. Using the re
sults of its recent survey, SACC
plans to continue in this role.

The survey is of particular
importance this year due to
prospective changes in Grinnell‘s
computer environment, like the
renovation of ARH. More com-
puting space (labs/terminal
rooms) is planned there and else-

where. _ _
The followtng is a summary

from a list of [1 characteristics.
had a positive response of 50
percent or more.

of the female students feel
uncomfortable that he may be
following her. And a friend of
hers happened along and walked
her to the place that she was go»
ing." A police officer arrived and
saw Phipps near Darby talking
with someone. Phipps was not
charged because he was not doing
anything illegal, according to
Boyer. “There are no charges
filed against him because if
you‘re walking along and
somebody drives up in a car and
makes you feel uncomfortable
and they don’t do anything else,
diat’s not a crime," he said.

Boyer said that “Totsic”
Phipps is about 27 years old and
has recently been arrested for
simple assault, possession of a
controlled substance, and criminal
mischief in the fifth degree. If
Phipps returns he will be arrested
for criminal trespass.

There have been several
problems with men trespassing
in the dorms and even of a theft
from a room on the first floor of
James Halt. “We‘ve had
complaints. .from students
waking up with the door opening
and they look over and there’s
somebody who pokes their head
in and says, ‘Is this so and so?‘
[or] ‘What dorm is this?’ or
‘What room is dds?” Boyer said.
He added that in Cleveland “the
people were sitting in the room
and the door opened and they just
peeked in. So I suspect very
strongly that that person
probably has something to do
with the theft in James,“ Boyer
said.

The police have little
evidence with which to identify
the man or men who have been
following women on campus.
“We have talked to one of them

professor Mark Bates. A summur
tion of the day’s events, the vigil
will involve a candlelight proces-
sion and a ZOAminute speech by
Bates. The vigil will end in a gesr
turc of unity with the lighting of
candles and some audience par-
ticipation. “This is intended to be
apractical message on how to make
peace a part of your life and make
it effective for your community,"
Said Bates.

that thatched the description.
And he Said that Initially that he
liadn’tbccn on campus. Then we
pinned him down LI little bit, and
he admitted that he was. So I
guess that it we have a prime
suspect, that‘s the guy,” said
Boyer.

The chief said that the man
must break some law or college
rule before the police can zict
against him. “We just have a
person who matches the
description of the person who
was seen on campus [followmg
peoplel," Boyer said. “He was
talked to and warned not to be on
campus unless he has a valid
reason. So far we haven't had
any more complaints yet, but if
we do, we’ll at least have a
general direction to go to. But
we need a better description and
also someone who can positively
ID this person. The thing we
have to be careful of here is even
though we empathize with the
students' concerns over people
following them, it‘s not n
violation of the law. And it
turns into a harassment by the
police when we start harassing
somebody who someone else
thinks is harassing them by
following them."

Boyer added that he
understands that “it‘s an uneasy
feeling that you get when you
look behind you and someone is
there and when you change
directions they change direc-
tions. . . ."

Boyer said that students can
help the investigation by calling
the police promptly when they
see suspicious activity. He said
that it would be “extremely
helpful. . ,if people would call us
immediately if somebody pops
the door open and says, ‘Oh,

sorry, Wrong room.‘ Call us if
they look like they match this
description. . .so that we can get
up there and look around the
area, . . .”

Crady said that students
should also report suspicious
activity to the Office of Student
Affairs. ”People ought to be
really careful. We’ve litid a
number of incidents recently
where solnebody’s being followtxl
or whatever and after hours i
think it’s extremely important [or
people to walk in pairs. . .and it'
people sight anybody that they
think doesn‘t belong on campus
to let us know right away," he
said.

Boyer said diai the police tier
partincnt is keeping ti “close eye
on the campus area." The police
have stepped up their activity at
the college. The department has
begun conducting foot patrols on
Campus. and Boyer emphasized
that the purpose of the patrols is
the protection of the students.

Students shouldn’t “be alarmed if
they see police officers walking
occasionally through the campus.
i think that it's for their
protection. . .to be around in the
area should an incident occur and
also to try to discourage someone
who might be planning to do
something from doing it. . . .”
He added, “They aren‘t there to
try and spy on the stur
dents. . . . They're there for the
sole reason of being visible."

Boyer said that the incidents
are not unique to the campus.
Similar incidents have occurred in
town as well. “We've had other
instances where people have
called in and said that there were
strange cars following them when
they walk
