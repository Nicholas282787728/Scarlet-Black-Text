By Antie Green

When school gets out in the afternoon, or just after
supper in the evening, Grinnell’s youngsters often find their
way to the imposing brown frame building on the corner of
Pearl street and Third avenue 7 the Uncle Sam’s club.
There they spend their time da‘ncing, working in the wood-
shop, in crafts, or participating in any of the other innum—
erable activities the club offers each afternoon and evening

Monday through Friday.

The clubhouse is open to all Glinnell children from
grade to high school age Specific schedules have been

established so that the program
may be geared to the interests
of a particular age group. Every
atternoon from 3 to 5 the grade
school children are welcome,
while the evening groups (from
7 to 9 pm.) vary with each
day, Monday and Wednesday are
junior-high nights, Tuesday is
reserved for the high school stu-
dents, and Thursday is the jun-
iorrl-ligh “dancing night."

Right now, during the Christ-
mas season, the clubhouse rs
festively decorated with santa
Claus pictures, paper chains and
sweet-smelling pine bougbs. A
miniature stage has been con-
structed at one end of the main
room.

Without a doubt, one oi the
most anticipated events or
the year is the annual Christ—
mas dinner, this year to he
held in Cowles next Thursday.
For those who in the past
have played host to one or
the hright-eyed, energetic
youngsters, the Uncle Sam’s
club dinner has become an
esential part oi the Christmas
season The dinner is tradition—
ally ioliowcd hy movies in
Aim auditorium and a visit
lrom Santa Claus who brings
treats for everyone.

Many Activities Offered

The club's activities are super—
vised by Mrs. Robert Thomazin
who works in cooperation with
the college students to plan and
carry out the daily programs.
Here on campus Uncle Sam's
club is sponsored by the YWCA
and YMCA. Carolyn Schott is
chairman on south campus, and
Dave Taylor hcads the north
campus activities,

Well over 75 college stu-
dents are presently helping at
the club. This number is di~
vided into individual groups,
responsible for the activities
and planning for one or the
periods each week. These
groups are in turn headed by
a north or south campus chair-
man. This individual planning
offers an opportunity to utilize
the students’ special skills or
interests. Monday night’s
group, for example, has been
taking lessons in simple cook-
ing, while the Wednesday
night group is making use oi
the new woodshop in the ha58<

 

merit. Already bookends, bird
houses, hird iccders, wooden
pictures, and ﬂoormats (made
by nailing pop bottle caps to
a board) have been produced

Big white mats can be pulled
onto the floor for tumbling,
wrestling or boxing. There are
basketball and ping-pong in the
big basement rooms. A tired
old juke box offers the latest
hit tunes, and club members
dancc any time the spi 't movcs
them to do so. (The proficiency
of even the youngest children
mirrors the advanced technique
of their high school superiors.)

Both the club members and
the college leaders arc presently
busy preparing the songs and
short plays for the Christmas
program at the club ior parents,
college students and interested
townspcoplc.

In the words of a college stu-

dent active in club affairs.
“There’s that intangible some-

thing about the club and the
kids there that makes Uncle
Sam's Club night one of the
highlights of the week,"

The train was stopped be-
cause it was believed by the
“stunt" organizers that this
was to be the last run of the
train through Grinnell. Later it
was explained by the conduct-
or that even though permis-
sion had been received from
the low Commerce commis-
sion to discontinue the run, it
would continue to operate for

Several months because of
many protests.

litter the train came to a stop
the conductor got off and de-
manded an explanation. Having
received it, he enjoyed hot
coffee and doughnuts, called
“All aboard!" and boarded the
train himselt.

Following this short and un-
expected interruption in the
evening’s schedule, the M s: St.
L pulled out of Grinnell and
continued its trip southward.

but yet not so contrived as the
notatcd craft of “Duke" Ellingr
ton and other “progressive” jazz
stylists. A great deal of Shear
ing’s music falls in the cate
gory of “arrangements," al—
though the pieces might have
developed from a kind of im-
provisatory trial and error sys-
tem. rather than one of calcur
lated notation.

Members of the audience who
have heard large quantities of
modern jazz, most likely felt
quite at home in the Shearing
style. He is among the more
emulated jazz artists of our day.
This is possibly to his disadvan-
tage since his disciples have
turned many or his ideas into
musical cliches. The listener is
constantly aware of rhythmic,
melodic and harmonic patterns
which lack freshness in their
stereotyped forms, The prepon—
derance of unison writing for
piano, vibraphone and guitar,
apparently among the remnants
of “bop," becomes quickly mon-
otonous. This is of necessity
more contrived than impromptu.

In the past few years, Shear-
ing and others have adopted a
sort of nee-classical eclecticism.
This may appear in the tom of
thematic suggestion, or at
times literal quotation, in which
case the listener experiences in-
tellectual satistaction in having
recognized a particular “snatch"
of Bach or Mozart, or it may
appear as an entire section in
imitation of Bach, Mozart, Cho-
pin, ctc., in which Case the jazz
crusader is prompted to advo-
cate jazz as an art torm. in any
event, the superimposed style
seems more an appendage than
an integrated part of the music.

Shearing is not influenced by

the style or Bach, but rather car-v
ploits the style of Bach in its‘

original, not too artistically re-
created, form. it should also be
