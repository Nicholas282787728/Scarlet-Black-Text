Nuclear freeze: enough is enough
C. Maxwell Stanley

What is the meaning of the voters'
response to a mutual nuclear freeze? or.
November 2, millions of Americans
trooped to the polls in nine states and
many cities and voted “yes” to freeze
testing, production and deployment of
nuclear weapons. Only in Arizona was the
measure defeated. The referendums car-
ried, despite the strong opposition of Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan and his administrate
tion, who hammered on the themes that
the nuclear freeze would benefit the Soviet
Union and mat some of those favoring it
“want the weakening of America, and so
are manipulating many honest and sincere
people."

The amazing political phenomena which
began with the marshaling of some 750,000
freeze supporters in New York at the open-
ing of the abortive United Nations General
Assembly’s Second Special Session on
Disarmament in June is not going to fade
away. Who are the nuclear freeze sup:
porters? Are they only flaming liberals?
Hardly, their numbers are too great. Are
they soft on Communism? No, Communist
idelogy and tyranny remain abhorrent to
the rank and file of Americans. Are they
led naively by the subversive influence of
external forces? Never, nuclear freeze
supporters are part of the mainstream of
this country's population; according to re

her because she had so much to copy.
Neither she nor I had the time to wait im-
patiently while a relic of the past slowly
cranked forth my econ readings. That
wasted time was uncalled for. And not five
seconds after I had begun to copy 7 can
you guess what happened? (No, ironically,
it did not break down.) But yes, yet
another student approached the machine
with a fist full of papers to be copied. Can
you imagine that? So why don't you make
a few students happy and take some
money out of Africa and invest it in a war-
thwhile cause: a device which helps save
the students’ precious time, Waiting in line
was bad enough in the lunch line, but an
outdated piece of technological garb is in
excusable, Behind in my studying
schedule and knowing why, Theresa

To the Editor:

After suffering through the pre- and
post-election issues of the 5&8, let me sug
gest that you send Brad Vander Linden to
a school for objective journalistic writing.
That way he can be ready to write election
articles by‘-1984, and the campus popula-
tion won’t be subjected to the borderline
propaganda in the student newspaper.

i realize (having been on a student
newspaper staff myself) that writing a
newpaper article in advance of the actual
event can be difficult, so I can understand
Vander Linden basing his pre-election
story on his personal political ideals.
However, it is inexcusable that his para
tiality shone so clear on the front page of
the November 5 issue. Not true, you say? i
beg to differ.

Despite the fact that Terry Brandstad
won the Iowa gubernatorial race (an obs
vious journalistic lead to a story), Vander
Linden begins the second paragraph of his
story by telling us that Roxanne Conlin
was the Democratic candidate for gover-
nor. Who cares Brad? We want to know
who won the election, not who the
Democrats nominated months ago. This is
not an isolated incident either; the whole
story’s written like that, in every race that
was mentioned in the story (wiui urie exZ
caption), we were treated to the name of
every Democratic candidate first. The ex-
ception’! Well. . . in the strictest sense it
wasn’t really. He did mention Cooper
Evans before Lynn Cutler. but only after
mentioning that "all the Democratic cons

cent polls, some three out of four
Americans support the freeze.

Enough is enough is the belief at the
heart of the growing antinuclear protests.
Realization is developing that expanded
nuclear capability does not assure greater
national security. The public that has long
supported the concept of nuclear deter-
rence is beginning to question the Reagan
administration’s moves to further expand
the already multiple overkill of our
nuclear arsenals, to trade deterrence for a
capability to fight a prolonged nuclear
war, and to stall on bilateral and
multilateral arms control and disarma»
ment efforts until our defense establish-
ment is expanded. .

Mounting Pentagon appropriations coma
pound the economic woes of this country,
The possibility of balancing the federal
budget recedes further into the future
unless the growth of military expenditures
is curtailed Furthermore, dollars for
weapons tend to mean fewer dollars for
essential social programs. Hence, the
growing realization that a nuclear freeze
would strengthen the us economy,

Moral and humanitarian considerations
also support the freeze as an essential step
to halting and reversing the worldwide
arms races, particularly the nuclear
weapons race. Belief is mounting that this

gressional incumbents and (then) all the
Republican incumbents had won reelec-
tion. Wait! There's more.

In his article, Vander Linden treated us
to quotes from a Lynn Cutler staff person,
a Democrat from the lowa House of
Representatives, the Democratic Central
Committee Chair of Poweshiek County, a
poll watcher for the Democrats and Janet
Carl, the local Democratic candidate for
state Senate. He did get one quote from a
Republican, though. Leeann Clayton must
be honored that Vander Linden sought out
her opinion. I mean, heck, he didn’t even
call the local Republican headquarters for
a quote (not in anyway to demean
Clayton's statement).

I don’t feel that it is asking too much for
any journalist to be objective, especially
when he or she is reporting on an election.
0.K., Brad, you've got two years before
the next major election, if you start work-
ing now. you should be ready by then. —
Andy Paul. 7 PS. I don‘t know how to
break this to you Brad, but Waterloo is the

second largest: Sorry.

A smoker's plea

To the Editor:

I am a Grinnell college student. I have
paid my tuition lor almost two years now,
helping to fill the till from which Burling
has been renovated. I am different from
the majority of the students who utilize
Burling. lam a victim of an awful, public-
ly nauseating habit 7 I smoke cigarettes.

I didn't really chose to be a smoker, In
seventh grade my sister corrupted me
with a gleam in her eye and a Marlboro in
her hand. “Try it," she said.

Well now I'm still smoking and unfor-
tunately, l have become dependent on
ﬂiese cancer sticks to the point that I study

livell with them. In fact, I cannot study
without them.

Now I’ve learned that smoking is to be
banned from Burling 7 my major
resource at Grinnell College. And I'm mad
as hell.

First Off, I believe that the rﬂults of the
survey on which this decision was partially
based were biased. Not only did the survey
fail to poll a large part of the student body,
but the question itself was not fair. I did
not ask whether people would tolerate a
smoking section, it asked if people prefer-
red 3 total ban on smoking, I believe that
the majority of students on this campus

country should be a leader in starting the
process of serious arms reduction before
the current arms races end, as all previous
ones have, in major war, perhaps even a
nuclear holocaust,

What does the freeze vote mean? It
means that a substantial number of
Americans ‘don't want to stay a course
marked for disaster. They want a mutual
halt, followed by substantial reductions of
nuclear arsenals. They want America to
commit herself to action rather than
rhetoric to reduce the likelihood of nuclear
war. President Reagan would do well to
listen to what the people are saying.

are democraticallyminded and would be
willing to grant us an area in the top four
floors. Asthmatic students could choose to
sit in another section.

As far as the fire hazard goes, well, fire
is always a risk, l-lowever, smoking has
not been banned from other buildings we
smokers like to pollute, such as ARI-I, the
Forum and the dorms. I understand that
the new carpeting cannot be rewoven if
subjected to cigarette burns, but if this is a
reason to ban smoking, why weren’t provi-
sions made? If there are burn-holes in the
carpet at this time, it is because often
there haven’t been ashtrays available.

I seriously don’t think that fire is a pro-
blem. If one ash began smouldering in a
student Carrel the first thing to go would be
his books, and I‘m sure someone would
notice this before the entire building burns
ed down.

Mr. Walker desires to lock us up in little ‘
rooms called “smoker's studies" in the
basement. it so happens that die library’s
most valuable collections are in the base-
ment — not on ﬁle first four floors. In addi-
tion, I don't like basements I like the nice
new carrels and I think I have a right to sit
at one.

Basically this motion to ban Smokers
from die major portion of Burling is to tell
us we can’t study in a designated room
with many other students crowded
together (there’s a lot of us you know! ).

Perhaps the nonsmokers don't unders»
tand that smoking is not a luxury for us
hard cores. It is an extension of breathing,
talking, thinking and studying, and to tell
us we can't smoke is to cut off a part of
ourselves.

I hereby move mat we smokers be given
an area of one of the first four floors in
which we can enjoy the new carrels, which
I find particularly conducive to studying,
except for the fact that as of yet, i can’t
smoke there. i ask for the support of non»
smokers; please find it in your hearts to
allow us a section of carrels for our puff-
ing, Thank you. Sincerely, Amy Fraenkel.
Smoker.
