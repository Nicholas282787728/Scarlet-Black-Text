Coaching policy puts
some in foreign territory

iw CHLOE MOKYL

When men's cross country/track and ﬁeld
coach Will Freeman started his career at
Grinnell, he began not with rtinners,but foot-
ball players. “l was hired as a track coach and
footballjust kind ofcame with it,” he said.

Grinnell’s contract requires coaches to fill
two positions and teach classes. Sometimes.
this means that a coach will lead one team
while assisting another, while other coaches
end up with a seemingly random pairing of
teams, putting coaches in positions where they
have little experience.

Though Freeman has
since been moved to men's
cross country and men’s
track and field, he went into
cross country with no back
ground in distance running.
“I really like distance rune
n_crs and their investment
with what they're doing, and
maybe one day I’ll know as
much about their sport as
they do, but when I started,
I deﬁnitely didn’t," said Freeman.

For some coaches, like men's and women’s
swimming and diving coach Erin Hurley, the
sports clearly correlate. But when coaches are
hired for one speciﬁc sport, and then are asked
to coach a second sport that they’re unfamiliar
with, it can lend to success in one sport over
another. Volleyball and softball player Sandra
King ’08 is directly circcrcd by the policy as
both her sports are coached by Tom Sonnich-
sen. She sees dual coaching as a disadvantage.
“I don’t think that it is a coincidence that the
(cams that are traditional powerhouses at
Grinnell have coaches that are coaching their
traditional sport, versus women’s basketball or
softball or golf that don’t have coaches in their
traditional sports,”said King in an email,

While Hurley's sports are similar, for other
coaches, continuiry is hard to ﬁnd, and reztms
can get hurr because of it. “When a coach is
not coaching his or her traditional sport, the
amount of specialized instruction decreases
drastically and ultimately the team doesn't
reach its potential,”said King.

Brian Jaworskl (mens soccer, men‘s

worski was asked iflic would consider teach
ing goli‘ instead of his previous position in
track, he jumped right into the opportunity.
“While it’s challenging for me to coach the
technical side of golf because I have limited
expertise, there are many other ways the coach
can contribute to the overall success [of the
team]." said Jaworski.

Golfer and basketball player Joe Fox ’08
agrees. “I believe that expertise is only a partial
ingredient orwhat makes a successful coach,"
he said. More important to him, and ream-
mate Carlos Lu ’10, is Jaworski’s passion tor
the game.

“Of course it would be
nice to have a coach who
knows everything about
the game, but what matters
more to me is having a coach
who is fully dedicated and
loves the sporr, and thar's
precisely how Coach laws
is," said Lu.

Jaworski’s dedication to
golf has come naturally to
him after being involved in athletics for much
of his life. "I have to rely on what I’ve learned
over the years in all different sports to help the
kids have an enjoyable experience,"said Jawore
ski. “Ifyou’rc putting the time in, and the plays
ers know that I’m watching golfand trying to
improve at the game, ifl can gain their respect,
you know you're going to be fine,"

Lu agrees, “i think that ifthe coach is fully
dedicated to his players, whether they are soc»
cer players or golfers, and everyone's having
fun win or lose, that’s all that matters."

Both Freeman and laworski agree that the
biggest challenge to fulfilling two positions is
keeping up with recruiting. Because seasons
run almost hack-to-back, it's difﬁcult to travel
to see prospective athletes play. “I have to work
hard every night on the phones; it becomes
much more important because you’re not out
there seeing kids play,“snid laworski.

“We work a lot of hours, and it seems to
never end,” said Freeman. “But I think we do
it \vcll.Wc have quality people who are deeply
engaged with both ofthcir sports.“
