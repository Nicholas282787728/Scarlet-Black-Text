on. FRANK Tliomi

Dr. Frank Tllonc, botanist, natural.
ist. lecturer, and editor in biology of
"Science Service", Washington, DC.
is another Grillnell graduate whose
words. as well as record, attest the
fact that the high quality of instruc—
tion at Grinnell tits her students for
whatever tasks they may later at-
tempt.

“Science Service," with which Dr.
Thone is now connected, has made a
place for itself as a result of its suce
cess in popularizing scientific subr
jeets and discoveries in a way that
interests the general public. In speak-
ing of his work Dr. Thone says;

"In my present work as a popular—
izer of science. I have found that the
things l learned with Professors Ner-
ris and Conard are as great. or even
greater. use as any of the advanced
teaching I received in the universi-
ties: and the command of German

which Professor Pei-ring drilled into _

me maltes easily accessible the most
important body of foreign scientific
literature."

Following his graduation at Gl‘inv
hell in 1915, Mr. Thane served for a
year as assistant to the registrar

here. For two years he was secretary
to the director of Seripps Institution
at LnJolla, Calif.

After serving as a second lieuten-
ant of artillery in the war, lVIr. Thane
came back to Gn'nncll as an instruc-
tor in English. From 1919 to 1922
he took graduate work at the Johns
Hopkins University and the Univer-
sity of Chicago, receiving his Pli.D.
degree from the latter institution in
1922, ~

From 1922 to 1924 he was an in-
structor in biology at North Dakota
Agricultural College. then associate
professor of hotany at the University
of Florida. During the summers he
was naturalist lecturer at Yellowstone
National Park, where he instituted
the educational lecture program now
given in the national parks,

Since 1924 Dr. Thone has served in
his present capacity as editor in hiol-
ogy for "Science Service,"

Douglas hchermott and Leslie Mc-
Keen are week-end guests of Roger
Hansen at his home in Des Moines.

Harold Currey. a former Gl'innell

Campus Opinion

ARE YOU IN FAVOR
INFIRMARY IN THE

Question:
OF AN
DORMS ?

noducy olrystecu: There is no
doubt that an infirmary in the dermis
tories would he valuable in preventing
the spread of epidemics. But to rob
Gates, already the smallest house on
the campus. of its choice suite of
rooms would he an injustice to that
hall. If some arrangement better
than than can not he made. I would
favor the continuation of the present
plan of hospital insurance for the
men,

Walter Straley: 1 do not believe
such a place is necessary. it would
seem that the need of an infirmary
would not warrant its cost.

501 ducobso believe that an in-
firmary in the dormitories would be
an asset. If we are ahle to stop cons
tagious diseases before they spread,
much discomfort will he spared. The
excessive fees charged at the hos—
pital, which many cannot atford, will
he saved.

Paul Trig . Yes, I believe in some
sort of an infirmary in the dormitor-
ies. The recent epidemic of throat
infections conclusively proves the
need for such an institution. Enter—
ing the hospital is easier than leave
ing and men are apt to continue in
school while ill because they are

afraid of being confined too long in.

a hospital. The infirmary would per.
haps solve this problem.

1min Oxlcy: A men's infirmary
would he a good thingithe men
would have a quiet place to sleep
when their nerves got ragged and
the halls noisy.

King For n all prohahihty it is
merely a political move on the part
of Kelly Stables to place themselves
in the good graces of the gracious
Mrs. Gail. 1 am not in favor of the
ideaiunless the infirmary is placed
in Clark.

Sam Singer: No—hecause there
would he a great tendency of the stu-
dents to visit the patients and there-
by spread the disease moreiwhereas
students are not visited So frequent-
ly at the hospital.

Joe Manderlcld: No: Unless it will
do away with the hospital insurance
Maybe all do not use the insurance
but it is the best protection,

Dick Ullrich: Yes the halls should
have an infirmary for the prompt
handling, especially of milder cases

 

of contagious or infectious diseases.
