LETTERS 1'0 THE EDITOR OWUSU condemns

Washburn for racism

Disco Week mocks everyone

To the editor.

I would like to address an issue
facing Grinnell students which I
findtobequitedisturbingztheDisco
Week controversy. The problem
hereisthatthereis somuch built-up
anger and frustration inside of so
many students, and they feel that it
is appropriate to vent it all on
inappropriate targets students who
sympathize, have arespect for, and
support all activities of Black
History Month. Therearemore titan
plenty of irnponant world issues
going on, and unfortunately, a
frighteningly large number of
misguided. misinformed, sexist,
racist. what-have-you’s outtltere to
vent your anger on.

Fellow Grinnell StlldE‘JlB are not
the enemies. To make this non-

issueanissucisludicrous,insulting,
and an enormous wasteof time and
energy. Please, bury the hatchet.
Celebrate Black History Month the
way itshould be . with seriousness,
respect, and an open-mind. But, by
all means, this is not mutually
exclusive of having a good time
and celebrating disco. Making a
good-spirited jest of disco is not an
attackagainstgays,lesbians,blacks,
minorities, people who enjoy the
feel of polyester against their bare
skin, John Travolta fans, or anyone
else. It is merely having a good-
natured laugh at a piece of the past
that we all share - the disco culture
, the clothes, the fashion, the
attitudes, the music; .all things we
can laugh about today. We’re not
laughing at any particular group.
We’re laughing at ourselves.

Politically-Correctness is a
greatthingandfreshchangeofpacc
from the right-wing ideals of the
Reaganitc years. But, don‘t go
overboard Let’s notbe overzealous
in our hunt for scapegoats. Let's
just stand together and take a
harmless, good- natured laugh at
ourselves in celebration of disco,
while at the same time keeping in
mind the serious events which will
occur during Black History month.
My point in writing this was by no
means to attack the Concerned
Black Students or anyone else - it
was simply to express my disbelief
that something so ridiculous could
ever take on such overblown
proportions and inspire me to write
this letter. Let the real issues be
debated and leave the non-issues to
the likes of Lee Atwater.

Hooray, Concerts Committee:
a happy ending

The Indigo Girls are coming to
Grinnell.

I still don't quite believe it.
When I see Amy and Emily walk
out on that stage, I‘ll believe it.
Maybe. IfI don't pass out from
excitement

[never thought I’d be a groupie.
Panicularly at age 20, panicularly
of a folk/rock duet whose lyrics,
laden with Christian imagery and
overextended metaphors, regularly
clash with my atheism and
simplistictasleinmusicYetitsends
shivers up my spine to think that I
might see them live, that one of
them might make eye contact with
me,thaxthereisaremotepossibility
that, during one of their more
energetic numbers, droplets of Amy
Ray’ssweatmay flythrough theair
and land on my skin.

Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating.
A little. In any case, the topic of
today‘s column is not to publicize
my almost embarrassing degree of
fanaticism for the Indigo Girls, but
to relay a story with a completely
happy ending,a relative rarity these
days.

I was in Chicago over break.
Right before returning to Grinnell,
I decided to stop by a Ticketmaster
outlet to see if, by some miracle,
that mmor ofa Midwest tour by the
Indigo Girls was a reality. It was,
and I knew that I would regret it
forever ifI hesitated, the show in
Chicago sold out, and I missed my
only opportunity to see the Indigo

Alanna Walen

Girls in concert.

Sol bought a ticket. One ticket,
for$26,toashow thatwouldbeZSO
miles away from where I would be
attempting to get a college
education. I thought perhaps I
could Ialksomcpeopleintoeoming
with me, as the Amoco bill for
traveling 500 miles on my ‘77
Caprice would be rather steep to
face alone, so when I returned to
school Iput up signs offering a ride
to Chicago and hoped for the best.

Sunday night. after I had gone
tobed,lheard someonecomehome
and start conversing with my
housemates. Soon I heard cries of
“Ooh! Tell Alanna! Wake her up,
she'll want to hear that!" I crawled
out of my cozy bed and padded into
the living room,rubbing sleep from
my eyes.

“The Indigo Girls are coming
here!” I looked from one shining
face to another, rather dubiously.
“It‘s true! I know the concens
chair, and they arranged it over
break.They‘recoming onFebmary
8." I decided that I would refrain
from becoming excited until I had
further proof, and I went back to
bed.

It was true. I took down my
signs and asked everyone I knew if
they knew anyone in Chicago who
might wanta ticket to the show. No

one did, I called Ticketmaster to
see if they could at least give it to
someone,aslfeltterribleaboutjusl
keeping it, but they couldn’t help.
So I sat on my bed and thought.
Who would know someone who
wanted my ticket? The answer
suddenly became clear. I looked in
the GAIA Guide, a directory of
women-oriented resources, and
there in the Chicago listing was the
solution: Women and Children
First, the city‘s biggest women’s
bookstore.

I dialed the number and Shared
my predicament with the woman
who answered the phone, She
thoughtforaminute,thensaidshc‘d
call somebody she knew. Igave her
my number, and about 10 minutes
later] got a call. Deidre, a friend of
the Woman in the store, had found
out about the concert after it was
sold out and desperately wanted to
go. I realized that the concert was
rather soon, so I decided to depend
on my past impression of the
women‘s community: trust people.
Irold her to put acheck in the mail
and that I’d put the ticket in the
mail. The check arrived a few days
later, and I assume she got the
ticket.

Perhaps this story doesn’t
leaveawarmfeelinginyouruimmy
the way it does in mine, but I hope
you can appreciate the happy
ending. Diedre got to see die
Indigo girls, and so will I. And so
will Grinnell.

To the editor,

I would first like to give Mr,
Washbum credit for his prolific
writing ability. However, he needs
to doa lot more homeworkon issues
before writing on them. It’s
unfortunate that his seemingly
superficial knowledge on a lot of
topics often make him sound racist,
bigoted and ignorant.

It’s been evident from a lot of
hiswritingsthatMr.Washbumhas
a penchant for picking on Africans
and AfricaneAmcricans. He would
lash out at Farrakhan with alacrity
but spare the Jesse Helms's, the
David Duke's and the K.K.K.

orten writing about African
dictatorships, he forgets thatone of
the worst human atrocities in history
occurred in this country: only three
decades back, American blacks
werelynchodJashcdandanlalized.
Just like Africa, Europe has had its
fair share of dictators—the
Ceauceseu‘s, the I-Ioneckers, the
Hitlers, you name them. Washbum
can talk about those, too.

Washburn tacitly exalts the
Pretoria regime as the best in black
Africa, giving absurd explanations
such as theexodus of Mozarnbieans
and Angolans to South Africa.
Aren't Moscow and Washington
behind the ﬁghting in these war
torn countries? Is it any wonder,
then, that their citizens flock to
South Africa for survival? Does
this necessarily show Pretoria as
humane and giving blacks the
majority rule they deserve? This is
cotnmon sense.

Washbum would never call the
A.N.C, a terroristorganization if he
was Well-informed of the untold
monstrous dccds committed by
Pretoria. Look at the massacre of
over 600 protesting school kids in
Soweto in 1976. Now, watch the

Pretoria’s new game plan:
Manipulating Buthelezi to cause
divisionandviolencearnongblacks.

And call the intrepid Mandela a
terrorist? Oh, what irony! And even
praise his oppressors who put him
behind bars for over 27 years. His
sin: resisting the inhumane system
of apartheid.

Africa has swallowed enough
of the venom unleashed on her by
colonialism and imperialism. We
are still in theprocess ofredefining
ourownpolitical identity whichwe
lost to colonialism. Labels like
Marxism, capitalism and whatever
-isms mean nothing to us now. It’s
even preposterous to continue to
allude to these labels in this post-
Cold Warel'a. What is communism
now?

Africa acknowledges that she
has serious economic and political
problems. Well, grave poliucal and
economic problems exist
everywhere. We've had self»nlle
for barely three decades. Vestiges
of colonialism and neoroolonialism
continue to’haunt us. The so-callecl
superpowers still play their dirty
games on our soil, Europe stole
trillions of dollars worth of our
natural resources. Americaenjoyed
billions upon billions dollars worth
of African free labor for over four
centuries. Isn't this enough for
Weslemers to appreciate?

Such apparent ignorance and
lack of understanding by people
like Washbutn on African and
African-American issues is not
amazing. Grinnell has no African
studies department.

Now, two prescription drugs
for Washbum: Eschcw prejudice
and delve deeper into issues before
you write. Then you will be able to
put up more objective and
consuuctive arguments.
