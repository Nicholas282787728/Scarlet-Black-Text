Harriers Travel
To MWC Meet

by Ira Keeshiu

The Midwest Conference
crossecountry meet will be held
tomorrow morning in Chicago’s
Washington park. ‘
Starting time is 11; the dis-
tance will be the standard
three-mile course.

Grinnell is the defending con‘
ference champion, but, accord
ing to Coach Richard Young,
the teams to beat this year, in
order of strength, are Carleton,

‘ - » - Lawrence, st. Olaf and Cornell.
“mg the big 1'“ and Stwng Young added that if the Pio-

“‘5 W 3°“ advantage! ‘helneers were at full strength,
edmen run is split-T Dewar of-lthere would he no doubt that
' they could win.

However, the harriers have
not been at full strength dur-
. in; the entice season. Tomor-
’ row they will be without the

services of Keith Kcstcr. Also,

Got Thomson, who ran for a

time as Grinnell’s first man,

was recently out hecause of
illness; he will run but will
not be in top shape.

On the basis of last Tuesday
night's time trials, the running
order in tomorrow's meet will
be Art Kisser, Lewie Sachs. Dick
Fisher, Paul Risser, Gof Thom—
son, Bill Patton and Ron Dorr.
Coach Young feels that Art Ris-
ser and Sachs should be among‘
the leaders.

Last Saturday at Cornell,
the harricrs were defeated, 24-
32. Cornell‘s unbeaten Homer
Latluier won the race in 15:22,
with Pioneers Kisser and
Sachs ﬁnishing second and
third in o dead-heat. Next
for Grinncll was seventh place
Thomson, followed by ninth
placg Dick Fisher. Pioneers
Paul Kisser, Bill Patton and
Keith Kester finished 11th,
12th and 14th respectively.
The frosh harriers. also run-
ning at Cornell, were defeated,
26~29. Cornell captured the first strengths and weaknesses. Look-

The IM football season drew

to a close last Friday with
Cowles defeating Smith, 19-6,
on a wet and sloppy MacEach-
ron field. The Cowles offensive
unit clicked for two touchdowns
the first two times it had the
ball in the first half. with the
score 6-0 in favor of Cowles,
Smith fought back to knot the
game at 576. Cowles scored
once more before the half-time

doubles as a sprinter and
hurdlcr in the spring, Com~
ing into the contest, Colichow-
ski, a two—year all-conference
man, is within reach of the
dtipon school scoring record.
His 54~point total is second
only to Cornell’s George
Phelps Ripon’s other backﬁeld
threat is George Sievers, a
loo-pound fullback.

Anchoring Ripon’s zoo-pound
ine is Charley Rutkowski, who,
t 260 pounds, plays a mean
ight tackle. Other mainstays of
~ line are guard Jack Flader
yid center John Benka.

however. The Pioneers recover—v

in a post analysis of the sea-1

success. The title holder, North,'
