Doderer: politics and women

by Jniict Pnpc

Minnette Dodercr, state Senator
irom Iowa City, spoke in South
Lounge Wednesday night on the
importance of women in govern-
ment Dodcrer is a Candidate for
lieutenant governor oi lowa

She Said that. raising the political
_consciousness and in,
volvementoi women in politics is a
factor in her deciSlon to run, “but
it's not why I'm running I’m
running because I think I‘m best
qualified for the Job I've been in
the Iowa Senate long enough and
it's time for me to move up or out.”

REMARKING [lint there are
now only two iemale governors and
three female lieutenant governors
in the US , Doderer said. “I think
voters are much more willing to
put women in legislatures than in
executive offices ,,

As part oi Women's Week,
Doderer spoke about “Women in
Politics." She identified
ratiiication oi the Equal Rights
Amendment as the number one
Women’s issue. Passed by the US
Congress in 1572, the ERA must be
ratified by two thirds of the states
by March 22. 1979. before it
becomes part of the Constitution,
So lar, the bill has been approved
by 35 states and needs the approval
of three more before it can be
added to the Constitution, 7

SHE SAID that residents of
Illinois are trying hard to get ERA
ratified. “If Illinois would ratify, I
think they would give the needed
boost to two other states, maybe
Oklahoma and Missouri."

The iowa state equal rights
amendment. which was passed by
the House and Senate this year,
would make a difference in Iowa,
she believes, because the amends
merit would outlaw discrimination
in all areas. Before becoming part
of the Iowa Constitution. the
amendment must be approved by
both the House and Senate during
next year's legislative session and
then must be approved by voters in
a statewide referendum

MUCH OF her speech dealt
with Iowa politics, government,
and laws "I think we have the best.
procedural rape laws in the US
She said, Iowa was the first state to
allow a woman to charge her
husband with rape. she noted in
the last couple of years, there have
been an increasing amount oi
convictions in rape cases “What's
going on is that police and county
attorneys are being educated to
proper rape procedures." she said,
Formerly, the process tor
reporting a rape was so
humiliating to the victim, that
many women did not report in
stances of rape.

Doderer said she opposes the
recent action of the Iowa House
and Senate which raised the

drinking age lrom 18 to 19 years
old “One thing I don't think we do
well is this country is cniorce
drinking and driving laws I think
we should be putting emphasis on
that area instead of the
drinking age,” she said.

ON THE subject of State lunding
for abortions, Doderer said she
favors funding regardless of
reason However. both the Senate
and the House have recently
agreed on Strict guidelines for
regulating the use oi public iunds
for abortions These guidelines.
which stipulate that federal funds
will be provided for abortions only
in cases of rape and when the
