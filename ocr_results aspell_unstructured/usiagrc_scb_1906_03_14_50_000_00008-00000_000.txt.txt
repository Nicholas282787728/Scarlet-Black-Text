MR. BUTLER‘S RECITAL,

Last Friday evening in the College
chapel occurred the tenth recital of
the School of Music Recital Course.
Mr. Herbert Butler has been heard in
recital here twice before. and his
third appearance ,was lully up to the
standard of the lormer two. The
program was very rich. Especially
noteworthy were the so. Sachs, Rondo
Capriccioso: the Bruch Concerto, and
the Bach Chaconnel This was the
ﬁrst time the Bruch Concerto has been
given entire, although portions of it
have been beiore, Mr. Jan Van Oordt,
now in Brussels, playing lwo move-
ments With the Rosenbecker orchestra
three years ago. Mr. Butler gavca
masterly interpretation of the entire
work, his rendering of the adapio be-
ing very warm and sympathetic, and
the final movement brilliant and ef-
fective. The Romanza by Margaret
Melville was the ﬁrst Work of the
composer, and is dedicated to Mr.
Butler. Miss Melville is an American
for some years a resident of Berlin,
now in Vienna, and regarded by
prominent German critics as foremost
amongrwomen composers.

The Dvorak Humoreske hasjust tlle
trace of a smile about it, and isas
sweet. and appealing a composition B
one ever hears.

Mr. Butler has played the Bach
Chaconne here before. His reading of
it was Wonderfully rich and effective.
The Ballade and Polonaiseof Vieux—
temps had notasgreat musical con-
[cuts as other members of the pro-
gram, but was handled in athoroughly
musical manner and made an el—
rectlve ﬁnal number.

It seems a pity, and inexplicable,
that there should he suchamarked
falling OK in the size of the audience
at the recital ooursoduring thissecond
semester. The course is one of the
best things to be had in Grinnell, and
it is unfortunate that the college con-
stituency should fail to grasp its op-
portunity, and that. the course should
be allowed to go by the board for lack
of proper ﬁnancial support.

There are three more recitals. Miss
Fisher )‘(ives her-last vocal recital Fri—
dny evening ofthis week. The String
Quartstteglves its last concert Frir
day following. There will be recital
by atenor Saturday evening theith of
April.

DAS DEUTSCHE FRAULErN.

Life in a boarding house aﬂ‘ords
little opportunity to become well
acquainted with the native girl of any
country, hence my impressions oi the
German girl were obtained not from
seeing her in the family but in sur»
roundings entirely different from the
home.

Girls are girls everywhere and as I
learned to know them better, I found
they were really nDtso different from
those in America, but had only lived
among diilerent manners and customs.
Co—educdtion does not exist in the
secondary schools, and the curricula
for boys and girls are entirelydiﬁerent.
The girls are taught the essential
rudiments, sewing, domestic economy
and modern languages, [good prepara-
tion for a Hausfl‘au,) and never dream
of college life or a career of [heir own
afterwards.

Only within a icw years have women
been admitted to the German Uni-
\‘ersities. Statistics Show that only

four per cent of those are toreigners,
Americans, English and Russians.

 

Though the university is open to
women, each professor may bar or ad-
lnit them as he chooses, and they tell
the true story of one woman. who sat
in the lecture room awaiting the pro-
fessor‘s arrival. ,He ﬁnally came,
greeted with the usual.l.ramping oi
the students, and belzall his lecture.
Catchingsight of the woman he stop-
ped short in the middle of a sentence,
walked down to her. ouered his arm
and escorted her down the aisle t0 the
door amid the cheers of the young
men. Another professor on entering
a room ﬁlled with men and woman
addressed
and Gentlemen,” but was prevented
from saying more by the hissing and
the scraping of feet until he changed
his recognition to “Gentlemen and
Ladies.”

Nevertheless woman in Germany
is winning her way and the movement
for her advancement is strong. With-
in only a few years has their been a
Y. W. G. A. in Berlin and a. strong
appeal is being made for interest and
enthusiasm among the young women.
It will take time to make it. a power
foriho German woman lacks the ex-
eoutive ability of the American, yet
the loyalty and skill With which she
Serves the home might put to shame
many of our young Women. The culi»
nary art alone does not constitute
the home, which is the place of rest
and amusement, the place to receive
and enjoy friends does not exist. The
restaurants are the place to see Ger-
man social life.

The companionship between young
men and young women which we have
is unlrown.

A German woman said that if a
young man called three or four times
and didn’t express his desire to marry
the girl, he was asked by the parents
if he had any intentio ns. Consequent-
ly the young men Who have no inten-
tions spend their time in questionable
amusements. While the American man
may enjoy the elevating and reﬁning
inlluence of our young women.

GIRLS’ ATHLETICS 1N GRINNELL.

Why are girls‘ athletics not So im-
portantas buys“) Do we not hear all
sorts Of talk, about boy’s athletics——
baseball, rootball, track and just now
the all important basket ball?

That the girls of Grinnell are in
terested in athletics is shown by the
way in Which every girl who has with-
in lleralove of sportenters into basket
ball, tennis and hockey with a rim
Which is not surpassed by the al’dol‘ of
of the football enthusiast.

The athletic work among the girls
has been very successful this year. In
the fall they resorted to tennis, hockey
and walkiugfor their required exercise
7013's: games in tennis werescheduled
but had to be given up on account of
the unsuitable Weather.

During the Winter term both the
second and third year gymnasium
classes have been greatly benciited by
a series oflessons in the use of the ap-
pal'atus provided. However, the most
interesting feature of girlsY athletics
is basket ball because it not only
arouses in the heart of every girl a
love for the sport itself but also bc-
cause it stimulates class loyalty thl'u
the rivalry for championship. This
year three of the class games have al-
ready been played in Wllicllthe Senior.
Sophmore and Academy teams have
been defeated, having only the Juniors
and Freshmen to play the iinal game
which will decide the championshlp.
A close and exciting game isexpected.

PROFESSOR EDSON DIES.

llr. llehrv Kingman Edson oi Grin-
uell passed quleLly away at his home,
on the morning or March 13. There
was no linEel'ing illness, no suilering.
llisliie has been a busy, userulonc
and stands lorth as a beautiful mem-
ory to those who knew him.

The most active period of his life
was passed in connection with Den-
mark.Academy, where he remained

for twenty-lire years.
He severed his connection with this

his audience as. "Ladles‘
'Hazelwood Cemetery

 

School in 1878 and one year later ac~
ccpted the chair or Pedagogy, created
for him in Iowa College. In this
capacity he served faithfully for
thirteen years, retiring from active
teaching in 1392. In him the college
has lost a ﬁrm friend.

Mr. Edson had passed his eighty-
third birthday, having lived more
than his allotted threesome years and
ten, and was apparently In good health
to the last. Ile leal‘esa widow and

cial me very pleasant.

\Vesle_\an has college spirit in full
force, as was shown the day after the
ﬁre, when a mass meeting was called
by the students and over $8,000 was
pledged towards a new North College,
much of it given by boys who are put
ting themselves through college.

I fear there is one point in which
XVeslellrln is ahead. of Grinnell, much
as I dislike to confess it, and that is
the singing at. chapel and at the
games. The ﬁrst morning I attended
chapel, which service by the way is
at 7:52 A. M., I was amazed at the
volume of (one and enthusiasm shown
in singing. I have learned since that
the college is noted throughout the
East for its singing. In the first place
there are some good, rousing songs.
and in thc second place the students
get together and sing. Why do you
not sing more, Grinnellites? Does the
new examination system not inspire
you?

There is a custom in \Vusleyan new
to me and rather shocking at first,
that of snapping the ﬁngers, instead
of clapping the hands for applause. In
a body of several hundred students,
the result is really very effective.

Though we had to leave Grinnell.
We still have Scarlet and Black as our
college colors: do you not all agree
with I'm: that there never was a better
combinniiou?

Now that I have put a few thoughts
on paper, I feel that. they are hardly
worth sending, They show, howevel.
my unfailing interest in Iowa College.
and carry with them the host of wish.
es from Mr, Heidel as well as myself
for its continued prosper-ii“
