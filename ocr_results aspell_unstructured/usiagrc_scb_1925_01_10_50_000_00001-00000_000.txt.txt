The award to \ seount Cecil or a
bronze medal and ",000 by a jury ol
distinguished Airiericdns, acting on
behalf or the Woodrow Wilson Folllltl.
ation, is an event or international inc
tor-est. Lord Robert, as he is (‘0an
manly known, was chosen as the per,
soil lnost conspicuous in the world loi-
his ”serr ice in the cause of lnlcl'uélr
t not emollelatlon and the establish-
ment of peace through justice."

In his speech of acceptancc in New
York, Lord Report made signiticant
, pronouncements on some of the most
important questions or the day. He
first paid tribute to Wilson in these
words: “He was a very great man He
was a great American and a great city
izen of the world. There is no title
to tame lrghcr than that. He liosscsr
soil, as we all know, a vEl‘y remark-
ablc combination or the qualities oi
tile strident and the statesman, a rare
combination and as adniirablc as it is
rare."

Turning to present day conditions,
Lord Robert continued. “Let me say
at once and willi great coniidcnce that
in the past rive years the adv ace in
the direction at inter-national co-oper.
ation has been little short or mal‘Ver
lous . . . greater than that ot any lllr
ilar human movement with which i
run acquainted."

in proof or this a sellioli tlle speak-
er cited‘ the wor already achieved
through the Dawes plan, the llllCl‘lldr
tioiial Court or Justice, the Internation-
al Labor orticc, and the trcatics sign-
td by most or the Central Pow-c s. pro.

w bin their borders. it is not gens
eraliy known that these treaties alone
constitute a charter or freedom to ion
ty million people in those countries,
and that their execution is entrusted
to the supervrsion oi the League,

Discussing the League and its ac-
ti tics Lord Rohcrt said: “Let me
stress one point, it cannot he too

parties may agree to accept the doors,

cases the Council itself will sccm a
more suitable tribunal. Or, it may
be, they will select as in the Corfu
case an arbi hi or rnediatory hody or
a diltei-ent character. That is tor the
parties to settle,

agrccmcnl:

In Lord Robert's judgment, the
much discussed Egyptian crisis docs
not come under the League's jurrs ic-
tion, “the League is there to deal with
not with re
lations allccting the llalioiml allmlillxr

that will be seen on the local tloor

The dopc on paper gives both teams

not as strong as Kansas, have a pow—
crtul team. Their ollcnsc, built
around Joyner, a sophomore playing
his last year of big time basketball,
is especially strong. The Kansas star

ilc's havc already played two games
i. in Gl'ilmell’s layer and the dope hir-
tiior indicatcs that llissonii is consid»
crabiy wcakcr than Kansas. Amos is
considered about the weakest team in
the conlerence this year, and itlissouri
had no trouble in dclcating them, but
the Jayhawkcrs alter playing a hard
game here journeyed to Amos and
swainpcd tile Cyclones 2x to 3. Un—
less Drake has a stronger team than
they are given credit lor, Missouri's
narrow vicimy last night would indi-
cute that the southern team is not
ncariy as strong as Kansas,

. ., Cluurgc Lineup
Although the Pioneers have under—
gone but one practice since the Kan—
sas game. it is highly probable that
there will be a tcw changes in the
starting lineup, Captain Gelviii, who
starter the game Thursday at guard,
and tr isticd at forward may lie set
at thc latter position tonight as Mur-
Im’s running mate. Wing, who went
in at Gelvlli's guard position when the
Pioneer leader went to iorward, plays
a strong game aside ti-oni occasional
wildness in passing, and will probably
llelp out winter at the guards. Wing
is a lcttcrinan lrom last year, and his
addition to the lineup would add more
cariciicucc to [lie tcaiii as a whole.

Scciniid righting F01“ t‘t

The center position app icd weal:
in the Kansas game, and there is :t
possibility that Coach Bloch may make
a change thcrc. scciand is playing
bcttcr haslictbali thdli he showed last
year, and is pushing bogs bard ior the
pivot position, but he lack in ex—
pcricncc, so it is doubttul it' he will
start. although he may get into the
lineup hctorc tlic game is ended. iloi-
an and ll'intcr both playi'tl strong
ganics Thrustlziy, so they will probably
be soon in the some positions when
the whistle blows tonight.
