IDEA 0F PREPPING

Editor’s Note: In the other editmial coinmn
on this page are two editorials, reprinted
from two leading nnircrsity newspapers,
airing the pro and can of propping. In order
to understand fully the editorial below, it is
necessary that the two reprints be read first.

Grinnell students should be interested in
the two reprint editorials elsewhere on this
page. They represent the pro and con of a
very interesting campus question, and _al-
though each is concerned with the situation
on its respective campus, they are unde-
niably related. , ‘

Here at Grinncll it is a welcome sight
this fall to see the new arrivals at the men’s
halls wearing the new style red on black
prep caps. It means new faces, new per—
sonalities and a new transfusion to the life
blood of Grinnell, which is so important
if Grinnell is to remain the top school ili
her class.

Although some upperclassmen would say
with more or less mistaken condescensicn
that it was a fine thing to have prepping
and all that goes with it because it puts the
freshman in his place, it cannot be said
that such an expression of thought is the
only or chief idea behind freshman regula-
tions.

Freshmen of Grinnell, you should be hap—
py at your opportunity to wear a prep cap
here. It serves as a reminder to you that
only by starting at the bottom of the scale
and working up can you hope to accomplish
anything. Also, in the uniformity of the
prep cap remember that no matter how big
a figure you cut in high school, you are
now on the same level as any other fresh-
man and must win recognition by your own
meritorious efforts. .

Before you are here very long, you will
find out that Grinnell is a democratic
school, and, if you carry out the rules given
to Grinnell freshmen in the spirit in which
they are given, it will only serve to empha-
size this democratic spirit and make it of
more value to you as an ideal.

Lastly, we as a college live and develop
under the influence of our Grinnell tradi—
tions, and the wearing of the red and
black cap, along with the performance of
your other duties, constitutes one of the
many traditions which you will remember
with great pleasure and longing after you

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

have forgotten many things you learned in
the class room.

IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING

(Reprinted from Student Life, Washington
University)

Last semester, when Student Council
voted freshman rules for the class of ’42,
there was much conjecture as to the practi-
cal value of the measure. Opposition con-
demned it as pointless horseplay—mild haz-
ing with no beneficient results other than a
slight boost to the already inflated egos of
upper-classmcn.

Freshman r les have, however, in their
two days of application, at least succeeded
in impressing upon the upper classes the
existence of a freshman class if only
through the medium of red-andgreen caps.
More important, they made the freshmen
aware of each other, and of themselves as a
distinct campus body.

And this is only the beginning. If pro—
perly administered, and if full cooperation
is obtained, freshman rules can benefit the
student body and the University more than
endowments or football victories.

For the objectives sought by the intro-
duction of freshman rules are of the long-
term variety. The atmosphere, unity, and
spirit which these rules were designed to
promote cannot be achieved in a few days.
And they will never be realized unless both
freshmen and upperclassmen accept the
rules in the proper spiritiregardilig them
as a serious and constructive attempt to
further that elusive quality known various-
ly as esprit do corps, elan, or just plain
umph! whose presence makes or breaks a
university's spirit.

FRESHMAN GBEENPOT--
TRADITION ON THE WAVE

(Reprinted From The Daily Northwestern)
Hangover from the rah-rah college days,
the freshman green pot has again been
perpetuated by decree 01" the Inter-
fl'aternity council. Thus has the council
indicated that it will cling jealously for
another year to a tradition as out—moded as
the proverbial horse and buggy.
Controversy over the green hat is a
customary issue at this time of the year.
Progrcen hatters argue that the hat is a.
worthwhile tradition, a symbol of class
unity, a needed criterion of college spirit.

The antigrcen hat faction holds forth tllilt‘

the pol: is merely an indication of over-
grown adolescence with no place on the
college campus.

It is significant to note that in the past
two years argument over the green hat
tradition has cooled considerably. Last year
the issue all but died out after a couple of
months. Many freshmen wore their hats
only for a short while; after they discarded
the pots upperclassmen hardly noticed the
change in scenery. If there was any college
spirit connected with the green hat last
year, it was seldom manifested.

Several years ago a prominent member
of the administration lauded the green hat
as a Northwestern tradition that should be
preserved. The phraseology of the state-
ment was unfortunate; a tradition can hard-
ly be preserved, it grows and lives only so
long as it retains popular support and in
terest. Wide-spread support of the green
hat is lacking on this campus, and as a
dying tradition, it should be allowed to sue»
cumb gracefully. And when dead, it should
be buried along with hell week and the old
raccoon coat.

DORIC

A COLUMN 0F PURE
BEAUTY

According to an eminent idcilliy
member, one well-qualified to
judge, this year’s freshman crop
has “the best looking girls and
the dumbest boys in the six years
I've been here.” The decision was
the result of “heresay and ob—
servations during the freshman
English placement exam."

There must have been method
in French instructor Smith's mad—
ness in purchasing that new Buick.
Have you noticed that big calen-
rler on the wall by his desk—the
one with spaces for appointments,
etc? Until recently, the only
“appointment" listed was “Satur-
day: 8:45 p. m.7DANCE.”

,, e s

It happened last week but it’s
still good, There's a transfer boy
by the name of Gahagen over in
Clark who got a telegram from
Miss Potter to the effect that she
would be in 'hlesday on the Rock-
et and for him to meet her. Duti-
ful, Gahagen cuts house meeting,
waits patiently for fifteen minutes
after the train leaves the station,
only to find no Miss Potter; re-
turns home, learns from a prep

that it would not be Tuesday night :

for 24 hours.

The next night he repeats the
performance and finds that Seeger
is also waiting for the Rocket!

.. e s

The two most important ques-
tions Ray Gustafson, super-prep,
had to ask of his house council
were: (1) "May freshmen go to
the local pub?” (2) uMay fresh-
men go on blanket parties?"
What is this younger generation
coming to?

r s i

it was only Saturday that prep
Jensen over in Langan happened
into the Moehi-Shepard suite for
his prep cap.
to one Moehl, upon request to
button, “Before I button for you,
will you tell me your name and
the hell you live in?
have to button for upperclassmen
living in our hell, you know.”
And the boys over in Langan

said prep Jensen _

We only '

were afraid that their “colleagues”
wouldn't do anything this year to
require “disciplining!"
