THE SCARLET AND BLACK

ARE IN NEW LUGATIGN

llarllilig & Nllckolls lIm‘e Occupied
"heir Noll Store on Fifth
.h‘einlc.

Bartling & Nuckolls have moved.
From their former location on Broad
street, the home at the H. P. Proctor
store betore them and identiﬁed for
so many years with the jewelry busi~
ness, they have felt the urge to move
iarther north. They obeyed, and now
are nicely established in the room on
Fourth avenue, occupied tor so many
years by china Hall.

All this is another indication of on-
e terprise on the part or this enterpris-
ing firm. Bartlins & Nucknlls have
been associated in business just a lit-
tle over ten years. The partnership
was formed ten years ago last Septem-
ber. They took over the nourishing
H, P. Proctor business and have built
it up and added to it until they hare
one or the largest stocks or iewelry in
the county, They are good jewelers
and hustling business men, and they
merit all the prosperity that has come
to them.

The new store is a beauty, tastefully
finished, convenient and attractive.
The ﬁrm may well look forward to
many happy and prosperous years in

the new home.

uphold the negative. Both teams will
be greatly handicapp this year by

' the lack. or time for adequate pl‘epal‘ar

tion, as the time set for the contest is
now only three wccks distant.

It was deemed inadvisable to debale

From the Quebec Chronicle, Sept. 14.

Not since the presentation of the

such a high class musical comedy as
“Flora Bella” proved to a capacity
house at the Auditorium last evenin:
It is a direct departurc from the regu—

inasmuch as it boasts of a plot which
is well deﬁned, interesting and worked
out to a ﬁtting climax, while the sinu

plished young lady possesses a so»
prano voice of extraordinary sweet-
ness and volume. She has an enchan:—

her way into the hearts of the critical
audience, who at last had the satisfark

could not only act and look pretty, but
who could give to the catchy songs
allotted her the full value at a bcaiir
tlrul voice.

The chorus is one or the strongest
which has ever come to the Audito-

very harmonious, while the male
voices blended in a most melodious
manner in the ensemble singing The
