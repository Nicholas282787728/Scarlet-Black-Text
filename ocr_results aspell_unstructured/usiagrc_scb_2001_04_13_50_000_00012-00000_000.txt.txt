New running routine drops flab, boosts ego

While 1 was dipping into my outfit for Mary 13. James last
weekend, I was struek with the sudden realisation that some.
thing war wrong.

Okay, many things were technically
“wrong," I suppose. i was trying to squeeze
my way into a sleek hlaek dress. i was trying
not to mess up my nail polish or smudge my
makeup. I was standing in high heels. 1 was
kind orattretted to myselttvhen i looked in
the mirror.

worst 0F all, though, when
I looked down to make sure my
leggings were on straight, i saw
the hegmningsors holly matting
my otherwise perfect ﬁgure.

The was tinaeeeptahle I've never had a god.like physique.
but I thought 1 was at least at the assistanttothohighpnosr.
like level. This» littlenhdominal protrusion made me think oth.
erwise Not heingahle to tome up with a good solution to my
sudden swollen midritrat the time, I did what any good woman
would do: i sueked it in and neariysuiroeared myselrthe terror
the night.

After the party, i mused on my quandary. i also mused on
what exactly had induced me to dress up like a woman tut yet
another year, lint i decided to save that thought for therapy in
10 yaatt.

Long storyrhort. i htd started jogging on awhim .1 eoupie
ordiiys herore MB}, and I dueidod tint 1 would now stiekwith
ii to iiatten the nth. Little did 1 know the impaer that deeision

two balls, no strikes

would have on me.

Now that I'm getting exercise more substantive than my
previous routine (sit up in bed in the morning, look at the
time, then tram/y lay but down to get some negative rep at.
tioni, 1 reel closer than ever to the athletes I’ve been writing
aboutroryears, instead orretlinglikes lowly sports editorwhen
1 walk across eampus, lately I’ve been feeling like a sports editor
who can run a mile without pasting out.

These new Feelings I'm having must he that natural high

people say athletes get. I’ve always gotten my natural highs
from things like sueeesstniiy reach-

ing the on swireh on the haek of
my eomputorwithout looking, so
this is all very exciting to me.

Even after only a week or so or jogging, I rind I have more
energy than I have had in a long time. i can do my physics reach
ing without railing asleep several times. i can leap tall buildings,
outrun lncornotlves and gtnertiiy do all those other things su.
perman em. Eteept for that whole looking good in tights thing.

As much as my physical wellheing has improved since l've
started running, my psyehe has improved even more. i parade
around esmpiis in my warm-tips, athletic shorts and sweaty [Cc
shirt with hand held high. 1 ean look all those once—intimidat-
ing athletes right in the eye now and proudly call them hroth.
ers and sister, Or 1 would he tihle to look |lmm in the eye and
say that irthey all went several Inches taller than i am,

i think my new exercise routine is Starting to have in errett
on people rtrotinti me, too. i swear the other night when i was
walking by ARI—l arter a good run someone looked at .ne as

nieiroiosjairrrsarr

Now that I'm getting exercise more sub»
stanti've than my previous routine (sit up
in bed in the morning, look at the time,
then slowly lay back down to get some
negative rep action), I feel closer than
ever to the athletes I’ve been writing about
for years. Instead of feeling like a lowly
sports editor when I walk across campus,
lately I’ve been feeling like a sports edi-
tor who can run a mile without passing
out.

though 1 were on tho hasahall term. i gave them aeltarmingyet
cunning “that’r right i hit .450 and steal 30 hates a season"
look, then quickly moved on hereto they could realize I was
wearing a New seienee Proieet shirt.

I’m definitely going to keep up this running thing. i think
the physieai and emotional henerns orthe exereire rat outweigh
the pain I have to go through For thorn. Pins, I’ve got this great
rainbow tiihe top for next year's Mary B, iames that i just have
to get in to,
