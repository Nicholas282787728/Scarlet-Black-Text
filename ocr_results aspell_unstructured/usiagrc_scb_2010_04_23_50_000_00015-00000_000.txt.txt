Lebron, Cavaliers still missing special something

As this nation prepares to delve into the NBA playoffs for

the next couple of months, a consensus has fallen over im»
partial basketball fans.The general feeling rs that the LeBron
James Experience feanrring the Cleveland Cavaliers is
too good this year to not win a championship. Sure,
the Cavaliers won a leaguerbest 61 games this year,
and are ranked in the top five rn points scored and
points allowed per game. However, the Cavs won
more games last season (56), and accually put up
better offensive and defensive numbers than this
season, yet they still fell short of the NBA Finals.
This Cavs team is distinct, basketball fans will tell
you, because they finally have all the pieces around
LeBron to cap off a lengthy postseason run with
the Larry O'Brien Trophy,

The Cavs had their asses handed to them on a
silver platter during last season's Eastern Confer
ence Frnals against the Orlando Magic and
there exist three main reasons why the Cavs

, lost that series. Most evidently,.the Cavs did
not have a big man that could match up with
Dwrght Howard. Nor only did he dominate
the boards the entire series, but Howard,
who has fewer lowrpost moves than a mail-
box, also torched the Cavs for 40 points in
the deciding Game Six, Secondly, the Cavs
didn’t have anybody that could matchmp
wrth Orlando’s hot-shooting forwards on
the perimeter. The Magic were able to utilize three players of
6'10”or taller that all sunk more shots than a herolnjunkie, By
bringing the defense outside ofrhe paint, the Magic were able
to further exploit the mrsmatches carrsed by Howard's freaks
ish combination ofsize and athleticism. For instance, putting
zydrunas llgausltas on Dwight Howard rs like asking a bear to
stop a Hummer on the freeway Thebcar is as brg and, in most
circumstances, more than capable to get what it wants but the
hummer is just too fast and packs too much power, Emily, the
Cavs seemed to struggle to score points at times when LeBron
was not on the ﬂoor or neutralized by a double team. Many
may chalk this up to a fantastic Magic defense, which is fair
but the' series would have been a lot closer if the Cavs would
have had some better secondary and tertiary scoring options.

The Cavs focused on all three of these areas for concern in
the offseason and at the trade deadlineThe crownjewel ofrhe
Cavs' acquisitions, ofcourse, is Shaq daddy Shaquille O'Neal

may be old, slow and overpaid, but he possesses the size

and post fundamentals to match up with and neur

tralize Dwight Howard, Shaq played in three

of the Cavs' four meetings with the Magic this

year, and completely outplayed Hmwrd when

the two were on the ﬂoor at the same time.

The Cavs also addressed their need for beta

ter forwards by picking up Jamatio Moon and

Antawn Jamisonitwo lanky, tall guys that

can play defense on the perimeter and are fairly

adept at creating their own Shotiln Jamison’s

case, extremely adept. Furthermore, Cleveland

has also done an excellent job in the development

of ll. Hickson, a young power forward averaging

nearly nine points and frve rebounds in only

his second year. These three forwards are

an immense improvement over last season's

Sasha Pavlovic, Wally Sczczerblak and Joe

Smith in Just about every category lmagln*
able.

Fans may wonder how the Cavs are supr
posed to play better defense this postseason
when four-time defensive player ofthe year
Ben Wallace was shipped out in the other—
son. Simple, Wallace is a fantastic interior

defender, who specializes at clogging up the middle.The Cavs
did not lose to the Magic because they could not defend the
paint, but rather because they could not defend the perimeter.
The Cavs have actually become a better perimeterrdefending
team without the aging and hrghly immobile Wallace, and the
same goes for Lotenzen wright.

so the Cavs solved all their problems right> LeBron is
destined to win a championship in his contract year and res
sign with Cleveland, right? WRONG. Maybe I'm drinking
too much Haterade but I cannot pick the Cavaliers to win
the NBA Championship this year. because the start of these
playoffs feels all too simrlar to last year. Remember how high
people were on the Cavs going into last year's playoffs? “The
Cavs have so much depth,"l>undits exclaimed,“LeBron frnally

has a worthy number two in Me Williams." Nobody foresaw
the giant egg Cleveland would lay against the Magic, simply
because they managed to go through the entire regular season
without revealing any huge weaknessesrThc same is true this
year—the Cavs do not appear to have any glaring deﬁciencies,
but it is entirely possible that a team could expose previously
unnoticed chinks in the armor. However, the Cavs have built
their roster for the specific intention ofnot losing to Orlando
the only real threat in the East, and so I don’t think anybody
will be able to upend the Cavs early this time around.

If the Cavs have truly solved their Eastern Conference de-
ﬁciencies and make the NBA Finals, then I think the Lakers
will beat the Cavs.The way I see it, Kobe and LeBron willjust
about cancel out each other's acrobatic, high—ﬂying basketball
circus. Cliché‘as it may be, the Finals will come down to the
teams around Kobe and LeBron respectively. L.A.’s big men,
Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum, have played extremely well
thus far in the postseason, and should pose some size problems
for Cleveland. Unlike Howard, Gasol is a fantastic passer, and
has the added dimension ofa relrable mid—rangejurnper. Shaq
will use his size to bully Gasol, but it rs unlikely that the Cave
will be able to utilize O’Neal more than 2025 minutes a game,
whereas Gasol could easily stay on the court up to 40 minutes.
Bynum is bigger, stronger and a better rebounder than Vare-
jao, as evidenced by the Lakers’ two wins over the Cavs this
year, As long as they can stay out of foul~troublc, I look for
the Lakers’ starting big men to draw the Cavs’ defense in, and
then kick out the ball to open shooters. Defensively, I
expect Kobe and Ron Artest to match up well with Jamison
and LeBron respectively Lamar Odomis also a huge defen—
sive asset for the Lakers off the bench, and should help check
the long and gangly forwards the Cavs will throw at them.
It's funny, for all the changes the Cavs made to their roster
in an effort to build a team that would not lose to the Magic
again, the Cavs may have actually built a team less likely to
win a championship. Clogging up the middle is an effective
strategy for defeating the Lakers,who have proven they cannot
win basketball games on outside shooting alone. The Cavaliers
will likely find themselves in the NBA Finals in June, but that
won’t stop yet another banner from being hoisted to the rafters-
ofthe Staples Center in October.

Ritter secured his pornt and the match-win
for Grinnell. The final score was 574,

“l was really pleased with Eric’s steadiness
and willingness to grind out points," Hamil
ton said. “He played with a lot of confrdence
and while he’s just a sophomore, his experience
showed in this close-match."

Despite Coe’s relative competitiveness,
Grinnell was playing with a full roster and comr
