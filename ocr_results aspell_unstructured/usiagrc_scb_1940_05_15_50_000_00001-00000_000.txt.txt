HOUSEPARTIES—

By Ken Mathews.

S. a”: B. Feature Editor

Now that Adolf Hitler’s legions
are menacing most of the coun-
tries in Europe, curiosity drove
us to the files or the Scarlet and
Black to see how World War I
came to Grinnell, and how the
Pioneer spirit reacted to it.

It is necessary to review some
of the history of the last war to
realize that the blitzkrieg is dis-
tinctly a product or this one. The
detonation came in June 28, 1914,
when the Austrian Archduke
Francis Ferdinand was assassi-
nated at Sarajevo (Editor‘s
Note: In those days war-like pow»
are used this obsolete method to
precipitate a war. Now the mod-
eru method of aggression to pre-
vent oppression is the vogue.)
A month later AustriaaHungary
declared war against Serbia, and
on August 4 Germany had crossed
into Belgium

The ever watchful Scarlet and
Black did not notice the war un-
til act. 7, 1914, when Pres. John
Henson Matin‘s vcsper talk on the
war was carried in the columns.
It wasn't until Jan, 13, 1915, that
the war again earned space.
This time Prof. J. D. Stoops had
made a speech on the war.

Beginning in October of that
year and lasting for the duration
of the war, the Scarlet and Black
began to publish a series of let—
ters by James Norman Hall, '10,
who was in France. His letters
tell of his experiences as a reporr
tcr with the Allied armies, later
of his enlistment with the French
army, his learning how to fly. and
his adventures as an aviator.

Evidently Woodrow Wilson
broke off diplomatic relations
with Germany on a press day as
the Feb. 3, 1917, s. s; B. carried
it as the lead story with these
headlines:

Relations With Germany Are
Broken by pros. Wilson

Military training for Crinnell
got its first discussion on Feb.
24, 1917, and two weeks later the
Pioneers petitioned the faculty
for compulsory military training
at a mass meeting. At the same
time a story was carried with
equal prominence under this head—
line:

Faculty Puts Ban
On Vacation Dancing
In Downtown District

On April 7, 1917 the Grinnell
faculty voted to put a system of
military training into effect im—
mediately. It was to be voluna
tary. Over 100 students sigmed up,
and regular drills were held the
rest of the year.

The June 5, 1917 S. s; B. car-
ried the story of the first Grin-
nell casualty—Lloyd Gettys, ex'zo,
who was killed in action in France
with the Rainbow division.

 

Editor ‘Puzzled’
Regarding Date
Of Cyclone Hunt

The 1940 Cyclone hunt will take
place sometime before reading
period, Helen Pcttigrew, editor,
said yesterday. “Im just as puz-
zled as everyone else as to when
it will come But,” she stated

Sometime, during awarm spring
night, someone will ring the
chapel bell. .Loggia doors will be
unlocked, and coeds will be al-
lowed to leave the quadrangle.

When and if the Cyclone is
round, and the editor notified;
the bell will ring a second time,
and the quadites must return to
the quad within ten minutes.
