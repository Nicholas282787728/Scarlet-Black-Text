The lollowing paragraphs are from
letters which have been received troin
Ernest Pi-ehni, who is now at Allen-
town, Pa, with the ambulance corps:

“I have been in the army six
nioiiths now—it any one had told me
that six months ago I would have
said that they were crazy; buL here i
sin. healthy and happy. it you could
only see us now you would say that
we were only specimens of men in
our youthtul days at college. Every
one or us have put on fat. rut the
sh months have passed as a. night—
and i wouldn't take anything for the
experience I have gone thi-u."

"It is surprising how happy all the
boys are here. and perhaps so in
every camp. Plenty to eat and work
to do makes everyone tcel right.
Every one remarks about our healthy
appearance.

"We have c regular Grinucll hunch
here, altho we are not in the same
section. There are ﬁve of us, tho.
who lived togctlie tor three years.
We are only continuing and enlarg-
ling on our college friendship. hut in
ion entirely dittcrout manner."
