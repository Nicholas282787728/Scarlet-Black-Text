Stamberg advocates info consumerism

by Kevin McKeough

National Public Radio personality
Susan Stamberg spoke beiore a
mediumrsized audience in Herrick
Chapel Monday evening. Slamberg,
who spoke ior «io minutes and then
answered questions for an equal period
of time. spoke on her job at NPR and
the need ior selectivity in news repor-
ting,

President George Drake introduced
the speaker, who was at Grinnell under
the auspices of the Time»Life Jourr
nalism series. Drake described
Stamberg as a woman whose voice "is
hardly new” to the audience and brieily
recounted her career as a broadcast
jounalist. Drake noted that Stamberg
had received several awards {or
jounalism in the past year and then
yielded the podium to the speaker.

Sumberg. who described Herrick
chapel as “the lanciest studio I've ever
worked except the oval ofﬁce," began
her speech with an explanation of the
NPR network, which lunds the nightly
news show, “All Things Considered."
that Stamberg co-hosts. NPR, she in-

dicated, is the radio equivalent oi
public television. Like television's
Public Broadcasting Service, NPR
receives tederal lunding through the
Corporation ior Public Broadcasting.
Stamberg described the CPS as an umr
brella organization designed to shield
the organizations it sponsors irom
political pressures.

Stamberg continued with a d rip-
tion of “All Things Considered The
Show. she said, reaches some two
million listeners every evening. She
noted that "All Things Considered" was
especially popular in smallrtown areas
that could not regularly receive the ma-
jor news dailies. Stamberg listed
several of the varied stories she has
been called upon to cover including
balancing the budget, Minnesota poetry
reading and interviews with a member
of the presidential marching band.
“I've been involved with that kind of
switchrhitting, schizophrenic reporting
for nine years." Stamberg said. To llr
lustrate the work she does, Stamberg
played a tape of an interview that had

been broadcast on "All Things Con
sidcred.”

Using the tape, which described a
woman's attempts to live in a medieval
setting ior a summer, Stamherg shiited
to her topic ior the evening, the need for
discriminating news iniormation. She
stated that it is not desirable to be
isolated irom news iniormation as the
woman in her interview had been but
admitted that it was diiiicuit to deal
with news media today. saying that
"we in the 20th century have no time to
contemplate the most cataclysmic
events that occur belore another
cataclysmic event occurs," She m'
dicated that the diiiiculty resulted irom
commercial presentations oi news,
which tend to give equal weight to a
number or issues Stamberg said in
creasing the amount oi iniormation
available would not improve the situa
tion "It's our job to sort out the cons
Siderations,” she said and indicated
that the newswatching audiences
shared the responsibility ior being
selective in their etiorts to be inlormed.

JB examines election procedures

by Bob Utke
Last Wednesday night the Joint

Board debated a coniusing series oi
amendments to a Bylaus revision. The
revision, which was postponed irom the
previous week's meeting, described a
new set at election procedures. The
original motion was made by Julia MG
Cray.

The controverSlal amendment was
suggested by George Turnbull and
would make the president and vice
president run on a single tic et. Turn»

that the president and Vicepresideni
Will work together and, hopefully. iorm
a more coheswe cabinet,"

The opposition argued that the
amendment would ellectively linilt the
number of people Wllllng to run tor ole
lice, Furthermore, the student body
could be deprived oi the opportunity to
vote for the best candidates. Shari
Rauland stated that with the split
ticket, "We have the opportunity to
elect the best preSident and the best
vice-president."

The amendment to adopt a single
ticket system failed. The JB also voted
down an amendment that would allovi
write-in campaigns in the run-olis. And
a third section was altered to provide .1
course of action in the event that ii
president or vicerpreSldeni should
resign his or her oiiice. The revision, as
amended, was passed on its lirst

reading. Before ll can enter the bylaws .

it will have to pass a second reading
next week.

in a special lunding request, the JB
unanimously voted to send ilowers and
