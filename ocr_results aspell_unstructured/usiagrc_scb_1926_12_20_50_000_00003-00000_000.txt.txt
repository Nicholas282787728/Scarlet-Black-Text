BLOND gentlemen and dark-haired gentlemen,

difﬁdenﬁl‘ freshmen and august seniors . . .
Prince Albert is the overwhelming campus-
favorite of every type and every pipe. (Yes,
the pipes do have a voice in the matter. They
can act in a docile, friendly manner or they can
be mean. It depends on what you feed them.)

Open a tidy red tin of good old P. A. That
ﬁrst fragrant whiff will tell you why gentlemen
prefer Prince Albert. Tuck a load into the bowl
of your pipe and light up. Fragrance and taste
alone are enough to win you.

But P. A. doesn’t stop there. ’It is cool-
smoking. It is mild as Maytime, yet it has
plenty of body. It is kind to your tongue and
throat. You can hit it up all you like and it
never hits back. Try a tin of P. A. You’ll

certainly prefer it after that.
