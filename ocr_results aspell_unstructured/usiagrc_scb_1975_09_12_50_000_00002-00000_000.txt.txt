Dean oi Student Aiiairs James
Tederman and SGA President will
Collins, will leave late Monday lor
Spokane, Wash, to observe a
unique residence hall system at
whitworth College. They will
spend two days observing the
arrangement in which potential

hall members sign living contracts ‘

Tcderman could not elaborate on
the specifics of the Whitworth
system, as he learned about it only
during a one hour presentation at a
convention last year, By spending
all Tuesday and Wednesday in the
residence halls they will be able to
view the dorm iormation process
in action.

According to Tederman,
potential hall members at White
worth work out contracts With each
other as to how they want to live
together in that llailihow they will
handle roommate squabbles, and
other disagreements, establish-
merit of quiet hours, use of
facilities, etcetera. Students who
cannot sign the contract cannot
live in that dorm.

of traditional dorm situations, such
as drawing bad roommates or lioor
members.

The plan allows students to have
even more control over their lives
at college. “i am a firm believer
that half or more of a student’s
education takes place outside of
the Class,” Tcderman said.

However, Tcderman does not
think it would ever Work totally at
Grinnell, He sighted the in-
dividualistic tendencies of many
Grinnell students. Moreover,
Wllitworth is a college with an
underlying Cllristian basis which
emphasizes sharing and
cooperation.

Although Grinncll‘s cooperative
housing “comes as close as
anything” to the w '

considerable success at Whit» f

worth derman ieels it has good
possibilities lor Grinnell. “In
lheor it sounds like a good idea,”
he said. It could enable a dorm to
intentionally develop positive

Posts
filled

by Rosa Michnya

Confirmation of Student-at-large
posts on sundry committes was the
main order of business at Wed-
nesday night’s SGA meeting.
Earlier, one Cabinet officer and
three members of the Joint Boards
had been assigned to handle ap»
plications and interviews for each
committee and compile a list of
nominees; when these lists were
presented to the entire S,G,A., they
were unanimously accepted
through voting by acclamation.

At this date, three subs
committees remain unfilled;
Health Services still has two open
positions while ’Forum and
Facilities and Food Services each
have one post vacant.

The Grapevine Committee,
which was designed to measure
studenﬁ' evaluation of the faculty,
has not yet been reinsituted due to
the singular lack of success with
which itmet last year Plans are in
the offing to restructure the
distributed questionnaire which
was completed by only thirty-four
percent oi the student body.

Turning in attention to other
matters, the S.G,A. voted to
establish a task force for judicial
reform, a subcommittee of the
Constitutional Reform Committee,
Chairperson Susan Green~Crim is
aided by Jim Tederman, Dick Vos,
Kathy Kramer, Joe Ferrell, .lay
Michaud, Rich Arnold, and Rick
DiBellD. All meetings will be
publicized and open to the campus
community.

S.G.A. Auditor Mike Herman
willhandle the budget with his new
assistant, Joyce Shinaberry, who
was considered eminently
qualified by the Joint Boards.

The Initiative Fund is now
available after being revised and
adopted at an emergency session
last week; the extent oi support
offered is outlined in copies of the
final draft, which will soon be
distributed to all resident advisers
and hail coordinators.
