Big problems hinder PE turno t

There is one Set of classes
definitely n rouhled by over-
crowding. ’l 's is the Physical
Education Department's me
structional activity courses. such
as swimming and racquetball.
Classes are small in Size, ivith
enrollments as low as two or three
people being common. only a
small percentage oi the students at
Grinnell is participating in these
classes. The physical Ede
ucation Complex is a racility
lvlth a large capacity and can
handle more students in the in-

‘ structional courses.

Ulldcrenrollment is conSidered a
problem by the department
Director of Athletics John Pittsch
stated that the department has
been working toward getting a
higher number or students
enrolled. He feels that though there
are many problems that could be
responsible for the low turnout.
“the problem oi fitting in»
structlonal activity classes into the
student's schedule is probably the
biggest obstacle.”

Coaching iiitci-ierence

Compounding the scheduling
problem is the tact that most oi the

instructors are also coaches This
means that there can be no classes
held between the attractive times
or 4 pm. and ti pm, This also
rules out early evenings and
Saturdays. although it is doubtful
that most instructors would wish to
teach at this time. Almost all
classes meetonly two days a week.
since athletic road trips causc
instructors to miss their Friday
classes,

Along with the scheduling
problem is the problem ol credit,
Instructional activities carn half a
credit per semester Few students
take an instructional activity class
for credit. As onestudent stated, “I
don'l take the course for credits. II
l want credits. I can get them
somewhere else.” However. some
students who pick up one or two
credits in instructional activity
find that those credits help them to
graduate on time.

There also may be a problem of
disinterest on the part of the ma
structors. Assistant Professor of
Physical Education Anna Wack,
who along With iormer PE taculty

remedy the loss of enrollment,

Director 01 Athletics John Piilsch rallies with students in a recent instructional activity class. As in

most such courses, the student-reach“ ratio could not be much lower. The two

stated that “the kids sense a
disinterest on the part of the Inn
structor and don’t show up.” The .
drop-out rate in gym classes is
very high. It is estimated that
between twenty and forty per cent
of all students who sign up [or
instructional activities courses
never complete them.

Beyond control?

Wack stressed the eliect of
student input. “We will teach

whatever the students want to
learn,” She said. But considering
the wide range oi courses olfered,
it seems that when the courses are
held is more of a problem than

what they are.

The cause or the problem may lie
in factors beyond the department's
control. Under the present system.
the major benetits irorn being in a
gym class are learning how to
become somewhat proficient at a
sport and exercising. It most
Grinnell students do not value
these benefits, or prefer to get
them on their own, then apparently
nothing short of making phys" 3']
education required will ‘bring
students to gym classes in great
numbers. As to whether gym would
again be required as it has been in
past years, Plitsch stated, “my
guess would be, at this point. no.”
