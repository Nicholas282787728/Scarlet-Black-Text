BLEACHERS

Until there is more in the foot-
ball shake-up. we have interesting
intramural developments to watch,
An error made last week should
be corrected now. and that is the
days designated for intramurals

. are Mondays and Fridays instead
of those announced last week.

The touch football schedule got
under way today wul‘a'the toni-
rusty teams trying each other
and themsel‘ves out for the first

time. And from what this writer
observed and “felt." we are going
to have some rough battles ic-f
fore the single round robin tourir
ey is over.

On Friday. Oct. 19. thcre i.ill
be a golf tournament to deter-
mine by low score the top nian
golfer on the campus. In hous
meeting six men indicated i
terest in this sport.

A racquet contest is also
scheduled before the weather has
us completely in its power. Over
twice as many men want to try
their luck in this sport as do
in golf. The first round will be

played on Oct. 12. the second on
Oct. 22. While the finals will be
played on Nov. 1. That is the
tentative Schedule.‘

The intramural program will
depend primarily for its success
