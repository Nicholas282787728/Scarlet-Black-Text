AN OPPORTUNITY will be given
Friday evening to judge of the
merits of our musical organiza-
tions in comparison witlr those of
the State University. It is possi-
ble that they may cover the same
territory partially in their trips.
and it will be interesting for us to
form an opinion as to their respect-
ive merits. The Orchestra aird
Glee Club have both been carer
fully trained by Professor Cole,
and reports from the few concerts
they have already given indicate
that they are fully up to lastyear’s
standard. The sale otseats has
been very large and success hnar-r.
cially is assured.

Opt MOTHER page is printed a
challenge tronr the sophomore
class to the freshmen to compete
in a dual athletic meet. III all
probability the challenge will be
accepted, It is surprising that
this custom has so long been liege
lccted here. In other ilistittltions
it has longheen a very snccesstul

' method ot developing new mate-
rial. As a rule the stars of the
track team are members of the up-
per classes, anti more encourage-
ment is offered the new men to
come out wlren they are not culI~
fronted with the prospect of com»
petil‘lg with the craelts of the col»
lege on their ﬁrstappearance. It
is to be hoped that the meet trill
prove a success. and that the plan
inaugurated this year will be cone
tinued as a permanent custom.

THE
lcges published almost weakly by
papers throughout the statewould
indicate that their track athletes
are already in hard training for
the State Meet.

Recent Episode at Yale.

Certain members of the junior-
class at Yale recently acquired
through their tlioughtlcssness. a
very unpleasant notoriety. It
seems that about a year ago the
ptigrlistCorbett visited New I-la-
ven and attracted some notice
amongtlicstudents. Consequent-
ly when hrs latest ﬁght was
ranged for, the students above
mentioned were very enthusiastic
in their support 01 hirn This en-
thusiasm led them to send him a
Yale flag accompanied by a letter-
containing warm regards and best
wishes for his success. Immedi-
ately on the matter beeorilirigpub-
lie, the [acuity totllt IL in hand and
compelled the students to apolo-
giie. 'I'lrisheirrgdoneanytrrrlhcr
olaicral action has postponed in-
deﬁnitely. Several of the most
prominentmembcis of the junior
class note implicated and it is ru-
nrmctl that the Senior society
elections will be much affected by
the unfortunate episode.
