Hey Pop! Take this...

Will Stroebel ‘04 and Scott Barton ‘04 don‘t agree about the correlation between large symphonies and the
composer's penis size, but they do agree that popular culture needs a classical music ”Bitch Slap”

by Elisa Lenssen

They just want ro make people happy. \Vcll, inuybe,

wavered n bir on pinpointing rhur emorion “were being
too cheesy," Barron said. But when Strochel pOSlK‘d their
listening eudienee as “creepy old men who are watching
lirrie children," Barton balked. “ire for people who eiuoy
cheered music," he said, “for it: own sure or for listening
to while studying." I interviewed them, and it's true: for
ehseienl music and criloyment's Shire (and yes, for my
pnyeheelr'e Sake), listening has
lLS merits.

Barton and Stroehel play
European classical selections

rhe Symphonic or toward ine
strumental-chamhcr music.

is “posrmodernlsm” he prefers. Barton responded by mum-
bling someLl-iing inartlculate about postmodernist music
being hilariously inarticulate. Srroebel slid ru Barton. “You
completely misunderstand postmodernism. It’s not nip.
posed ro be hilarious." Barton pamed. There was dead air.
