Tabori, one oi the four men
to run the mile in less than iour
minutes, was among the 50 men

Hagstrom became the marina

they were at the relays, setting
up the press conferences, order-

oi their personal needs; while
Miklos translated from Hungar~

iar. to English for the press.

For Miklos, it was a great
honor, Tabori 15 considered by
the Hungarians in much the
same way that Americans once

considered Babe Ruth
