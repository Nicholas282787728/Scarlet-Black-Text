The Treasurer's Office has
recently received and opened ior
student inspection a proxy
resolution from the United States
Steel Corp. it contains stockholder
resolutions. includinga resolution
concerning the company‘s
business in the Union of South
Africa. The resolution concerning
South Africa will be proposed at
US. Steel's annual stockholder
meeting May 7 by the Domestic
and Foreign Missionary Society
which is affiliated With the US
Episcopal church.

The society will request to the
board of lrustees that U.S, Steel
limit the scope of its South African
operation until the government
takes “meaningful stcps toward
the achievement Of full political.
legal, and social rights tor the
African. colored tracially mixedl
and Asian populations " The
resolution says the socxety believes
the expansion of U S. Steel in South
Africa lends moral support to
apartheid and is “unwiskboth
politically and economically,"

THE BOARD or directors oi

Could result in substantial
losses "

Grapevine

include questions on specifics
which require short paragraph
answers. The current evaluation
form provides “space to relate any
further comments and-or
criticisms you have concerning
either the course or the teacher,”
but the rest of the questions are
geared for a simple number rating

As long as thc system or
gathering the students' response
remains as it is, Cragg says, the
evaluation forms must remain
brief in order to obtain the largest

. possible response.

No issue oi the Grapevine was
published last semester due to a
lack oi student response. said
Cragg. “i believe the Grapevine

, could be improved and hopeiully

will be improved in the future,"

a large reply to the questionnaire,
the Griipcvine's signiiicance would
be reduced.

Dorms: are rights respected?

Are faculty members aware of
life in the dorms? According to one
student who had to come up
against the Grinnell College legal
system: “a lot of the faculty don't
know whatlife in the dorm is like~
irom experiences rve had most
professors are not concerned as to
what happens there."

Prndded by the Grinnell College
Admissions Board, which ex~
pressed concern about student
responsibility in dorms, Dean
Waldo Walker called a special
laculty meeting last Monday to
“raise the consciousness level of
the community, especially the
faculty."

AT MONDAY'S meeting, Dean
of Student Affairs Jim Tederman
addressed the iaculty, and
described the concerns expressed
by the Admissions Board.

But, said classics protessor
Gerald Lalonde, ”The meeting was
mainly taken upwith defense ofthe
present system.” Lalonde doesn‘t
deny that there are problems in the
dorms, but he didn't think that the
evidence presented at Monday’s
meeting matched “the seriousness
of the situation as it was advertised
before the meeting.”

“Noise, disrespect tor the rights
of fellow students, damage to
property. and the general level oi
unruliness,” in the dorms were the
issues of greatest concern to the
Admissions Board.

TEDERMAN SAID that
statistics from this year’s RA.
evaluations, which achieved a 5|)
percent response rate, show that
noise was seen as a problem by 25
percent oi the students polled. The
dorms that showed a high rate at
dissatisfaction With noise levels
were Mears (48 percent
dissatisfied), James (40 percent
dissatisfied), Loose (39 percent
dissatisfied) and Rawson (33.7
percent dissatisfiedl. Tederman
qualiﬁed these statistics by stating
that noise was a relative quality
and hard to measure empirically,

Damage to college property
seems to be at an all time low,
Tederman said, and the college is
paying less than ever to repair
Vandalism related abuses, Walker
added. There is less property
damage at Grinnell than deans at

other A.C,M, schools report, he
said, adding that all of the damage
cannot be attributed to college
students, since vandalism in the
whole town oi Grinnell is up.

WALKER RECALLED when he,
as former Associate Dean of
Students, and a repair crew oi B
and G workers used to have to
completely reconstruct the lounge
of a dorm after parties.

Tederman said that respect ior
other students was a hard quality
to gauge, but he added the
statistics show only a percent oi the
students ieit the level of respect in
the dorms was low 'Dan Magur»
Shack, a member of the Ad-
missions Board, said disrespect is
an “impressionistic” problem and
is therefore not easily quantified
He Said only after much reluctance
did he find students willing to
discuss the problems oi respect
and well-being in the dorms.

STUDENTS SIIOULDN‘T be so
reluctant to defend their rights
says Susie Wittpenn, Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs. She Said
”Students don't have so much a
lack of respect for others as a lack
oi respect ior themselves. They
have to be able to stand up ior their
own rights,”

Grinnell‘s present legal system
avenues do not provide adequate
remonstrations, R A Mike Jay
says, Tederman says that in the
preSent system. all too often the
”buck gets passed."

IN THE CURRENT system, the
dean of Students has no direct way
oi disciplining students in the
dorms. A Student who has a
complaint must go‘ through an
elaborate series oi hearings in
order to get his case tried. And the
student, if the offense has been
against himself, has to go through
Grinnell‘s highly “legalistic"
judicial system, as Tederman
called it, by himseli, on his own

 

initiative

Tederman said problems should
be solved before they get to judicial
council because the “support
systems" in the dorms should take
care of all problems beiore they
get that far, Last year nobody used
the System, but this year more
students are learning how to de
fend their rights in the new system.
Lynn Boughay, SGA vice
president, says that he expects aS
many as ten cases to go betore the
all campus judicial council this
year.

THE CURRENT SYSTEM
assumes adult behavior on the part
of the students, Says Lalonde, but
he acknowledges all of the students
aren't adults. ”It's conceit on the
part oi the administration to say
that students are capable oi ruling
their lives,H said Lalonde He
added, “The system is predicated
on the fact that Students are adults
and will come forwardiil' it's not
working, its the price of liber~
fdrian freedom in the dorms,”

Despite these proplems, the
faculty is unwilling to return to the
system oi in loco parentis. The
faculty, as professor Ken
Christianson says, ”shouldn't play
much of a role in the residential
system , . , Even if is were failing,-
we have no alternative but to
continue under present conditions."
