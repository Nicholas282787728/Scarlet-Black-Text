N0 PROBATION DAY‘.7

Fi-csluiieu disciplillevl‘lcll week, propping,
Probation day—Cull it what you nill, has final]
dct ioratcd so for that it may not take place (his
year at all, .

The Grinnell tradition of teaching former lll
Shot high school uthlctes and class presidents to
have it little respect for their cldcl'sAnt lclist until
they grow up to be sophomorcsistnrted the down—
ward road a few years ago, when ,i'cdrrround
prepping was abolished, and has been Continuing
that way over , .

“’9 are not barbaric cllqngh to believe tllllt
each freshman should be “paddled witliiil an inch
of his life” everyday, just to provide amusement
for nppcrcla men “who got it” themselves when
they were f ~st-vem- lucil. 0n the contrary, we
think paddling should be done only as :1 lost lucds-
ui-c.

But. we do believe that fl'cshlncll should be
taught a little more courtesy to nppei‘classmcn, as
well as tllcir professor

The freshmen we spczik of are not the fellows
who were taught courtesy at holncililthougli 1
lot of them have been hero long enough now to
lot it slide a little—but, for example, the young-
sters who nloilopol' the club room radio news-
papers, :lnd bridge tables and figilrzttil .ly, or
actually, thuilil) their no at objecting upper-
clfissmen. .'

Whether or not we have prepping days, or
“Probation day”, as it is now called. this your, doc
pends on whether or not the men of the dormitories
want them, according to Walter Stralcy, president
of the Council of House Presidents.

Let’s have prepping days of some sort this
spring, even if they amount to nothing more than
slapping naught 'eztrlings’ wr ts lit a “pink tea”.

Prudities This Year?

iblielher or not the "Pioneer Pmdlties" should be revived this year,

‘PRO’

A burning ' snc is this matter of producing the
Pioneer Prud ies this year, and rightly so, too.
This school is (lead through and through.

If the student body hasn’t enough life to
plunge into this affair and crash the iron-bound
cloak of sobriety that enshrouds Grinnell students,
we are just another bunch of dull boys and girls
affecting sophistication and cynicism.

Pioneer Prndities, a six skit. competitive the-
atrical production, was put on to uncover tlicatilcr
nl talent in students not dcs' lg to major or minor
in dralnatics to unify the student—body; and to
provide some light diversion from the more seri-
ous aspects of school life.

If ever we need divcl 'oil from the more seri-
ous aspects of lifc, now is the time, for tomorrow
we may not be able to afford the jo) ‘ college
life.

Every yclir without Pioneer Pruditi ' menus
another year l [:0 blc dramatic talent goes out of
Grinncll unrecognized

With so much concentration upon individuals
cares and financial worries, thc inevitable loss of
unity among tllc entire student body is m-rivnl .

One could ji t about di 'eghrd the time cl.
inelit ill producing the Pruditics this yczir when
considering the value rcccii ,d by all, but; we con-
tend tlldt there till olnplc time to producc them.

Other Opinions

COLLEGE ATHLETIC PROFITS
(Dolly Trojan)

The president of Oberlin college, Ohio, has just
analyzed college athletics, among other things, in a book
"The College and Society." His sentiments merit com-
ment because they represent a popular view of the
national athletic situation, although this view confuses
the actual situation with what college athletics should
he, might be and ought to be He says:

"The American college does not need less athletics
but more. More from the standpoint of general partici-
pation, of high sportsmanship, of real courage. Audrshe
needs this because the future welfare of our nation
rests so largely on the use of leisure time and on the wise
and sympathetic handling of international affairs . . .

“The two great weaknesses still evident arc the de
sirc for championship teams by those outside the student
body, and the necessity for large sums of money to
carry out elaborate athletic programs. Despite the die-
harcls, both of these weaknesses will be overcome and
a spirit of moderation will prevail. And when it does
prevail, athletics will assume its proper place as a
legitimate and helpful element in college life."

Practically every college in the land provides at
east two kinds of athletics. There is the highly or—
ganized interscnllege program and the less known intra-
coliege competition between fraternities, dormitories,
classes and among students in alkuniversity tennis,
boxing, golf and other individualistic sports. As a re-
sult, there are two aims. The first is to provide a school
for professional athletes and coaches. As a byproduct
of this training, profit is reaped by schools, especially in
football. Although the net rewards to universities from
athletics is over-estimated by the general public. what-
ever a university can glean from such contests ought
to be welcomed to the coffers of physical education.
They are fairly earned and go to a more deserving cause
than the profits of professional spectacle.stagers.

The other aim of college athletic programs is intra-
college activities for the whole student body, individuals
as well as groups. All who wish to participate can gain
physical health and self-confidence which sports seek
to provide.

Athletics both inter-college and intravcollege are
necessary anti important parts of a university. They
should be accorded their proper places. They do not
need to conjure up imaginary benefits and talk of in-
eulcating sportsmanship and "moral training" to justify
their existence. '

IS COLLEGE A LIABILITY?
(Minnesota Daily)

The press carries a dispatch to the effect that stores
hesimte to hire college-trained girls as saleslodies, We
might, expect to' find the story sent from some general
store in the Kentucky hills where "book larnin’ " is
an object of suspicion, but instead it comes from the big
department stores of New York. An endeavor to place
a few unemployed librarians in book departments there
was. unsuccessful, because personnel managers were
afraid of college-trained girls.'It seems they have a
habit of selling only the books in which they are p‘er-
sonally interested, The implication is that no hook de»
partinent could make expenses if it sold only the litera-
ture which appeals to college»bred saleswomen.

Most of us imagined that when the last dollar was
lost in the stock market, when the last mortgage was
foreclosed and the last bank boarded up, everyone would
see that there is no safer investment than money put
into a college education. The experience of these New
York coeds belies this conclusion, but it is not the first
time that an employer has expressed a preference for
nonscollcge employes. On more than one occasion men
have made it a point not to emphasize their e‘oilcge ex—
perience when applying for clerking jobs and similar
positions.

From the employer's point of view we can see where
this prejudice against college graduates often is justi—
fied. College people are notoriously out of touch with
the world. They have the idea that all life is organized
along the lines which have become so familiar to them
during their founyear confinement on the campus. The
discovery of a very different outside world produces in
them the very human reaction that what is different
i inferior. As a result many college graduates use their
training with airs of superiority and condcsension.

In some cases the employer's loss may be greater
than the prospective employees. But the whole situation
is grounded in the unwillingness or inability of college
people to adapt themselves to new conditions and in»
dividuals. ‘

All liollcst iildll's the noblest work of God.—
Alexander Pope.

i, 1:. Ryan, pro-
fessor of speech,
endcavored to
ciitrast the
trong personalk
. tics of Washing.
/ . on and Lincoln
. / by considering
them in the light of public speaking.

Abraham Lincoln reacted to peo»
ple, ivhile George Washington react-
ed only to principles. Emphatically
the latter was not a public speaker.
but according to Mr. Ryctn, be u- ,
an example of a beautiful and useful
life, and in his speaking was a “spirit
who reacted first to balanced ideas.
then to people as a secondary con-
Slderation,"

Thin-salty
in discussion of a question that is
international in scope, R H. Norton,
instructor in history, criticized the
nations of- the world for their double
standard in treatment of others.
,“Wo attempt to judge other na-
tions by preaching justice, but we
gain our own ends by the principle of
expediency." Mr. Norton illustrated
his point by citing the dealings of
Gleat Britain in East Africa in which
treaties with natives were upheld nus
til it was beneficial to the English
settlers for them to be broken.
To remedy this, we must “either
lowlcr ideals or make radical changes
in economic righteousness. It is hard
to believe we can lower our ideals,"
