PROPOSALS NEEDED

Echoes of the firm stand taken by the new
president of the Student Council are still heard
throughout the campus. However, the ensuing
discussion of a possible means of solving the
question of what to do with the institution of
student government as personified by the council
has gotten no farther than such discussions have
in the past.

In spite of rather angry grumblings, at times,
of the students over the matter of student gov-
ernment and the council, the arguments always
seem to be rather pointless.\ The existing in—
stitutions is a farce. Everyone agrees that
there is a need for some action, but as yet there
has been no concrete proposals as to what to do
with the council. It is true that something
was attempted last year, in the reformation then
instigated, but from the meager accomplishments
achieved there is some doubt as to whether or not
there was any definite policy in back of the re-
formation. If there was, then no attempt was
sincerely made to get a cross section of campus
opinion.

The Student Council was installed as a more
or less experimental'idea and, as far as can be
discovered, was not desired particularly or de-
manded by the students Hence to really achieve
anything in the way of getting real power for the
council, the students must first show an active
interest in the matter of student government. The
most adequate way in which this can be done is
to have various proposals made to the new Stu-
dent Council, outlining plans for reformation of
that body into a really powerful institution.

Using these plans as a basis, a clear-cut plat
form of reform could be drawn up, and the matter
discussed and either settled in favor of increased
power or against by the administration. In either
case the students will have shown that they
genuinely desired a reform, and that the matter
is not merely idle campus talk, as now seems to
he the case. ’

ADJUSTING CENSORSHIP

“The criterion of decency is fixed by the time,
place, geography and all the elements that make
for a constantly changing world,” declared a New
York City magistrate last week in declaring that
“Novembre” by Gustave Flaubert is not “objec—
tionable literature." “Novembre” is the autobio»
graphy of the author, dealing particularly with
his love affairs, It was translated into English
three years ago and has since been the object
of attacks by numerous guardians of local morals.

The Statement that morals are Constantly
changing is not a newly discovered fact, but never-
theless is one that is far too rarely recognized
by the courts and by many groups and organizae
ions.

m GEINNELL SCARLET AND BLAﬂK

As a proof of the fact that the standards of
decency are constantly shifting the New York
Junior league put'on an exhibition of works ban-
ned down through the ages. Among them were
such generally read books as Homer's “Odyssey,”
Shakespeare’s “Richard the Second,” Conan
Doyle’s “Sherlock Holmes,” Hans Christion An~
dersen's “Fairy Tales" and “Alice in Wonder—
land." Does one need further proof that moral
standards are constantly changing?

Although this fact is obvious, morally minded
groups should be quicker and less obstinate in
recognizing the fact. lnnumerahle fights and
arguments take place because they try to sup-
press and censor things which are in keeping
with the current moral standards and which the
people demand. Such censorship is useless as
the people will find ways to get the censored
books, movies, or whatever it might be, anyway.

Further the efforts of the groups which are
constantly attempting to have things censored
give untold publicity to things which will not be
censored but which should not be brought square-
ly into the public eye. Is it not far more ef-
fective censorship to suppress these by burying
them through ignoring them rather than making
them conspicuously through publicity?

Also it would be well if bodies of censor-
ship were to keep up with this constantly chang-
ing standard. Rather than attempt to resist
the inevitable, they should constantly adjust
their viewpoints to the trend of the times, how-
ever liberal his may be. ~H. H.

T0 MANY COLLEGE GRADUATES?

Editor’s Note: (Much of the material in the follow-
ing article is equally applicable to problems facing Am.
erican college students. Unemployment among college
graduates is not only prevalent in America but
even extends to such less educated countries as

.china, and the folowing is a brief excerpt express—

ing the Chinese students attitude on the subject.)
o o . a

By Kenneth H. C. Lo

The question before me is whether China needs more
college graduates. Which side am i to take? In a country
like ours where the task ofmodemization has been begun
for only a few decades and the work of reconstruction
is under way, the question should not become an issue.
is the college not the place where the youths of the coun—
try receive their final training for the purpose oi recon.
structing society? Are not college graduates the people
whom we rely upon to rejuvenate the decaying nation?
That such a question should become an issue shows
either that China is not wholeheartedly launched on the
project of reocistruction or that there is something wrong
with college education, something that gives rise to
doubts regarding its merits and usefulness. 1f wewant
no reform, then it would be well for us to continue in
our old ways with our old mentality that has been good
for the last few thousands of years. We would have
no need for college graduates since their spirit, their
ideas, and their method find no place in a society that
is self.complacent and conservative. But if we should
feel that the trend of modernization is an irresistible tide
then we cannot but rely upon colleges for the production
of those men who are qualified for the task. We cannot
hut entertain high hopea regarding them.

It is idle for us to entertain any doubt as whether
China should follow the path of modern civilization or
continue in her old ways. Even to thestatesmen of the
old school during the Manchu regime, modernization and
reconstruction seemed inevitable. It is they who first en—
couraged the establishment of institutions of higher edu~
caion for the sake of providing the country with young
men trained on western lines. More than half a century
has now elapsed since these pioneers first exerted their
efforts. There should be no doubt as to the general
trend. However, the phenomena that accompany the
graduation of so many students each year bring within
their trnin serious problems respecting the inherent merits
of the system.

The most disheartening phenomenon that faces us is
the high percentage of unemployment of those who have
completed their studies in the so-called highest institu.
tions of learning and who are prepared to cut into
society with their newly whetmd sword of knowledge.
How they are disappointed! Instead of finding society
welcoming them with open arms and waiting eagerly for
their services, they find that they are not needed and are
to let their tools rust and decay with perhaps no hope
of ever employing them. From this phenomenon, the
inference is made that college graduates are not need—
ed after all. For if there is a need for them, how is it
that they are not employed? Surely, the laws of supply
and demand hold good in this case as in any other case.
The supply should correspond to the demand. if it
exceeds the demand, the overproduction would be value-
loss. Are our colleges overproducing? ~

CHAPeu
NOTES

Monday

Prof. Grant w. Smith, instructor in
chemistry, spoke in Chapel Monday
about the stratosphere ﬂight which is
no he made in the Black Hills this
summer.

The purpose of the ﬂight is to
study the cosmic rays and certain oth.
cr phenomena, he explained.

The chemical aspect will be much
more important than the ability of
the balloonist, according to Mr. Smith.
There are several problems in con-
ncction with the balloon. The air
supply must be adjusted so that there
is 2 per cent or less carbon dioxide
in the air. Various methods are used
to accomplish this among which is the

 

use of liquid air or a tank of oxygen.

The color of the balloon is also im-
portant, After much experimentation,
the original color of all white for the
balloon has been substituted by mak—
ing the lap white and the bottom black.
The white will attract the sun’s heat
and the black will deflect it, thus
making the temperature even.

Other problems incurred arc thc
avoidance of mercury, which cats the
metal, and the weighing off of the bal.
loan. The latter will probably be done
by ballasting.

Tuesday

Joscph w. Charlton, associate pro~
lessor of economics, delivered the
chapel talk Tuesday, centering his
speech around the instability of the
American people in regard to recovery.

Most of this insla’lblllty has been
caused by political upheavals, postwar
effecLs and by the 1933 repeal of pro-
hibitlon.

 

He cited glaring examples of
foolish brainstorms which included the
gullibility of the American public re
garding Technocracy. the hallyhoo of
1933, the Townsend bill, the chain let.
ter craze and last, Father Coughlin.

”There lies ahead of us a great chal«
lenge," he said, "to find the best solu-
tion of our problems in the spirit of
liberalism without taking time out for
wild Utopian schemes."

professor of the piano, and David E.

Dean of Barnard Declares
Women Barred from Jobs

New York City “Women are being
forced back to the kitchen," not only
because of the depression, but also
because public sentiment is opposed
to the idea of women working inmen's
jobs. Dean Virginia G. Gildersleeve of
Eamard college ‘declared recently in
an address before members of the New
York branch of the American Associa—
tion of University Women.

“Opportunities are being closed to
women and they are discriminated
against when seeking jobs," Dean Gil-
dersleeve asserted. “An example of
this is the unwillingness of employers
to appoint a married woman to a posi—
tion. Jobs are now regarded as sort
of dole. You are supposed to give
them to persons who need them the
most, rather than to those who are best
qualified for the work."

The “challenging situation” in edu.
cation was also referred to by Dean
Gildersleeve. In some communities,
she said, school teachers were paid
less than persons recei ing the dole.

Pittsburg University Adds
News Photography Course

Pittsburg, Pa,—What is thought to
be the first formal instruction in news
photography has been introduced into
the curriculum of the University of
Pittsburg, with the start of a class
in this subject here recently.

Of 300 applicants for the subject, 17
juniors and seniors of the school of
journalism were admitted. The class
meets two days a week and carries
with it two credits.

According to Luke Swank, head
photographer of the univerLity, who is
in charge of the class, the course is de<
signed to give the maximum of prac-
tiso and the minimum of theory and
its ain-l‘is to teach something about
every kind of photography. “We are
sending our students out and telling
them to take shots of anything they
want," he said.

Science Reveals Old Folks
Need Larger Vitamin Supply

New York City—Adults and elderly
persons need Vitamins more than
children, and furthermore need an un-
interrupted supply, it was reported re—
cently at the Chemical Industries Ter-
centenary meeting of the American
Chemical Society.

The report was made by Prof. Ar-
thur H. Smith of Yale university and
Dr. A. U. Orten, and called attention
to the the fact that previous experi—
mental studies of Vitamin A had
been directed toward its effect on the
very young. Dr. Often and Prof,
Smith endeavored to detennine what
happens when vitamin A is slightly de-
ficient over a long period of time,

As a result of their experiments on
rats, the investigators announced that
“during the time when an apparently
adequate supply of vitamin A was giv-
en, too little was stored to Protect
adulE in case of emergency. It should
be emphasized that the need, for this
indispensable food substance in adult
life is continuous."
