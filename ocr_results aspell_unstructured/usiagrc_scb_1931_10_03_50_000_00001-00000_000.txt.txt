NUMBER 8

Injuries Force

Both Elevens
to Shift Men

Miller, Sheffield
on Hospital koster

Burley,

for Teachers

A pair of football teams, more
closely resembling ilivalids than
grldliieli met at 2 pm. today on
the Slate Tcaclle college grid-
iron if the advance word of coach-
es was any indication of the real
condition of the Pioneer and Tu-
tor elevens.

Both aggregations were Schedr
“led to go into the contest with
injured backﬁeld Stars on the
Sidelines. At Cedar Falls, Coach
L. W. Wllitfovd had Bob .Bllrley
Ollrillc hospital list. with a game
ltllee ll'llilc A] Miller was nursing
it sprained allklc.

Veterans Fill Gaps

Coach L, L. (Fuzz) Watt of Grin-
hcll was scheduled to keep Rose and
James out of the game, the former
with a bad shoulder and the latter
,with an injured leg.

Fisher and Olsen, the latter a
backﬁeld veteran, were to handle the
vacant posts for the Purple Panthers
while the Pioneers used Graflund and
McCreary, also veterans,

Pioneer Linc Crippled

Grillnell managed to outdo the
Pedagogs in line injuries. The best
the Cedar Falls aggregation could
muster was one weak spot where
Sheffield was laid up with an injured
arm and shoulder. The Pioneers had
G012 deﬁnitely out for a month With
an injured leg, and Trumbull playing
at right guard with a shoulder brace.
He ﬁlled Graﬂund's place, the latter
being shifted to Rose's fullback place.
‘Figland, a guard hope, was still
limping and Erwin, another guard
had an injured shoulder. Rosenbloom,
win was scheduled to start at left
gtwrd, was in good shape except for
a badly battered face.

Grinnell Favored

Captain ,Chrlscoffersen, scheduled
to open the contest at center, was
bothered a little by an injured hand.

The dope bucket flavored Coach
WattL‘S Pioneers before the game be
cause of the flashy passing and run-
ning of Hank Thomas against Coe
last week. The many shifts in the
lineup may result in breaking this
combination, however,

The Tutors, on the other hand, had
a line which topped the Grinnell
average by 10 pounds to a man. Be-
hind that 185 pound line there were
Fisher and Klmberliu, a pair of line
battering backs who might play
havoc with Grinnell's transformed
line.

Watch Air Attack

In an effort to break up the touted
Grinnell aerial attack, which has
made the Pioneers a continual threat
on the gridiron since Coach Wall:
ﬁrst started work here, Coach Whit-
ford pulled Berry, his veteran center
back of the line on defense.

The Teachers team won its first
game, 19 to 0 from Columbia of Du-
huque last week.

Ofﬁcials for the game were North
(Highland Park), Carruthers (min
ois), and Kline (COB).

Coach Watt took the entire Grin-
nell squad of 34 players on the trip.
