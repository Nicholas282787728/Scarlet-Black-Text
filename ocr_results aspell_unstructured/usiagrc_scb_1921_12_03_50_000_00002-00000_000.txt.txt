KEEP UP WITH THE TDIES.

The Scarlet and Black is trying
something new today. Frankly, it is
an experiment In see the attitude that
the campus will take to n distinct
change in e. policy or long standing,
a policy that aimed to reserve the col-
umns oi the campus paper for strictly
campus news. The Scarlet and Black
will welcome criticism irom its read<
ers, either tor or against the innova-
tion, and will be glad to receive sug-
gestions for the continuation or the
column.

"The World At-
fail-s” will seek to touch upon only the

Barometer of
high lights of \V'Dl'ld happenings from
week to week, and in particular upon
the one great lecture that is largely re-
sponslble for the department, the Dis-
armeut Conference at Washington. In
company with other college publica—
tions, The Scarlet a'nd Black, thru the
National Student Committee tor the
Limitation ol Armaments, has secured
the services of Colonel Frederick Pal-
mel‘, one of the keenest and most. ex.
Pel‘iehce of those who are interpreting
the Washington Conference for the
public, (or E, series of weekly articles.
The ﬁrst one appears today and gives
something or the background.

The Scarlet and Black believes that
the average college student is too
much occupied with other things to
spend much time on the news of the
day- and as a result is often not abreast
oi the times. “The Barometer" will
not attempt to present the news in
full but is simply what its name im—
plies—an attempt to indicate the
trend of world events and to simpliiy
the prohlem oi keeping up with the
times. _

these games, from personal and class
interest, form an attractive'recrcatlon
as an opener for the inter-scholastic

Editor's Notei—Tlle Scarlet and

columns, a hrrei summary or the most
important events in international ni-
rans. This department will seek to

world's news on the period and hop

gone on record as opposing Francs

Colonel Frederick Palmer, the Dean

from the Grew-Turkish War of 1897
down to date. 1914-16 he was the ac-

Washington: The third plenary
‘sesslon has been held this weak, Ind
the committees are at 51‘le wll‘h their
Work. At a, plenary session all the
delegates make a public api'ienran‘ce.
Then you may see the chieb' “up
stage" and back of them thell‘ numer-
ous subordinates, and back of these
.thc representatives of the world's
lPl‘ess and all other persons who have
sufficient influence to secure tickets
of admission. Then you may listen to
the clear tones of Mr. Hughes, as
Chairman, to the well turned phrases
or Mr Balfour, m the gusty enuncia-
tion in Japanese or Baron Kate while
.you Watch the immobile {sea of Mr.
Root, Br Senator Lodge as he thought-
,tully 17195593 his ﬁngers together, or
General Pershing, sitting so ﬁrm and
erect.

At. the ﬁrst plenary Sessloll Mr,
Hughes said to the world: America is
,ready to cut down her navy. here is
‘her programme. Hitherto, when no-
tions talked about limitation of arms-
ment the Question was "Who will be-
,g‘ln ﬁrst?" and no nation held up its
hand as a vcluniee‘i‘. Mr. Hughes
uroposed that the three great sea
powers start naval reduction at the
same time. What would the other
two sea-powers say to this? At the
second sossion they accepted in mine
ciple. Then committees were appoint.
ed to work out the details.

 

The third plenary session was held
in order that Premier Brinnd of
France might state the situation of
France, One may he held, if Premier
Lloyd George comes to America, to
allow him to he as eloquent about
his cuuntly as M Britind was about
his. This would be only fair play End
