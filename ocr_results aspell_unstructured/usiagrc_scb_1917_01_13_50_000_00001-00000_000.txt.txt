Contagious.

All (cars that Grinucll was to be
gripped by an epidemic of scarlet fev-
er and smallpox were put to rest yes-
terday afternoon when Dr. E. E. Har-

ris, city health pliysicidn,'declal-cd to-

a reporter for The Scarlet and Black
that the danger of such an epidemic
was practically eliminated. At one
time assuming a serious aspect, the
future spreading of the contagion is
now considered improbable. These
statements were corroborated by Dr.
J. Pusprague, head of the department
of Hygiene of the College.
Wright To “Post House.“

The one smallpox victim, Harry
Wright, '20, was removed last night
to a room in the grandstand on Ward
field, which has been fitted out come
fortahly and will he used in the future
as a pest house, owing to the lack of a
detention hospital in Grinnell. The
Gibbs House, Wright’s former place of
residence, has been iumigated and will
be reopened as a college hoarding club
next Monday. According to the health
authorities, the members of the club
were not openly exposed to the dis-
ease, as Wright was not associated
with the men, merely rooming in the
house. The principal reason for his
removal and the reopening of the club
was the fact that twelve men were de-
pendent for their board on work fur--
nished by the management.

Patient Takes Auto Trip.

At the present time, only two cases
of scarlet fever have been reported,
aside from the one smallpox victim,
and all are of an‘extrcmely mild na»
'ture. One of the men, Ray Fuller, ’20,
has sufficiently recovered from his at-
tack to be taken to his home in Water-
loo by auto. He made the journey last
Thursday night, with the permission of
the State Board of Health and accolue
panied by his mother. No stops were
made en route, and the home of Fuller
in Waterloo was immediately quaran-
tined upon his arrival, thus reducing
the possibility of contagion to the milk
inium.

No Girls he Ill.

Tire third victim, Max Her-riott, ‘20,
has practically , recovered, though
quarantined but a few days ago.

No cases have been reported among
the gir . A rumor was circulated yes»
tcrday morning that a girl in the Quad-
rangle had contracted scarlet fever,
and that she had exposed a large ruin!
her of torrsilitis patients in the intlrrrn
ary. Upon investigation this proved to
be without foundation.

“Keep llcttlﬂ

Dr. Harris made the statement that
any student suffering from sore throat
or fever should immediately consult a
physician. “These," hc added, "are the
first symptoms of scarlet fever, and
anyone coming in contact with a per-
son in such condition may be exposed
to the disease.” He emphasized the
dangers of a physically unfit constitu-
tion by stating that any man who runs
down i s vitality by lo. of sleep or
overwork, lessens his powers of ro-
sistance, and places himself in the best
possible condition to contract disease.
A-rnau in good health stands ten times
as many chances lo cscupe illnc as
one who indulges Ill excesses, accord-
ing to Dr. Ha is.

Grlhuell’s basketball season opened
auspiciously last Wednesday night.
when the local five trampled all over
the Nebraska University team with a
22-h score. The representatives of the
far—famed university made a sorry
showing atter the first few minutes of
play.

The feature of the game was easily
the guarding of the Grinnell team. Nc~
braska secured only three field goals,
and two of them were made from the
,center of the floor at the start of the
game. Nebraska was allowed but very
few open shots. Whether they tried
the long or short passing game, or at—
tempted to dribble, the result was ale
ways the same—some Grinuell man
was on hand to block the ball.

Norris, Swan and Augustine were

the best games of his career. He was

la pretty field goal. Swan's work was
invaluable in breaking up dribbles,
and in playing the ball to his team-
mates. He broke oven with his man
on the scoring proposition from the
field, and displayed good ability in
