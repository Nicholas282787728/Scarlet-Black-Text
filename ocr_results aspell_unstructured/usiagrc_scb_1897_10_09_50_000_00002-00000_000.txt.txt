WE ARE glad to note that there
has been agoodly number olspeo
tatots at the Athletic Park each
evening watching the iootbali and
track teams at their work. Noth-
ing can be ntore encouraging tot
the men than such ‘an exhibition
of interest on the part of the stur
dents. We would however urn
gently request the on lockers not
to interfere with the work of the
teams by crowding onto the ﬁeld
or track. Your presence is very
desirable it only you are consid»
crate ot the rights of the athletes.

TUE ATTENTION of college and
town is again called to the Y. M.
C, A. lecture course. The ﬁnanr
(:55 of the course will be run on a
slightly different plan than on
previous years, inasmuch as a
charge of one dollar will be made
on course tickets, it purchased he-
tore October t5. “The v. MC.

A. plan," while it ditl permit the _

lecture to be heard by an unusual
number, has proved a ﬁnancial
failure. The association is now
about two hundred dollars in
debt, and it is necessary that this
be removed as soon as possible,
Considering the quality or the
course, the present plan is practir
caily free to persons witll any ap~
preciation of such entertainments,
and. for those not so disposed.
there will be no temptation to
prevent the enjoyment of the lee-
tures by others. The association
has always given high grade ens
tertainments such as no sludent
ought to miss. With such names
as Booker T. Washington. Rev, J,
J. Lewis, Rev. Thus. Dixon and
Hon. Chas. Fitch, it will be seen
that ttte‘ present course ofters a
series of entertainments, vartcd
and instructive, to every thinking
person. Tickets should be secur-
ed at once from Collins, Graves,
Witmer. Moller, Pierpont or
Marsh. Atter Oct. t5. the ticie
ets will be sold for Sl,25. Single
lecttue tickets, 50 cents each. Re—
served seats ten cents extra,
