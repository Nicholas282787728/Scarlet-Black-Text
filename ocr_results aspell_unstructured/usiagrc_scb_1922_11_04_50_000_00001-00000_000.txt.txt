These/lodge sites contain many in-

heads, bone drills, pottery, and other
mplcments. The pottery, which is
most important, differs greatly accord-
ng to the tribe which made it. The
Algonquins decorated their pottery
with incised markings and punched
designs, and often pressed a. coarse
fabric upon the moist clay. Their prov
duct is usually rather soft and is
tempered with sand. Sioux pottery is
very different, both in tempering and
design. It is a hard gray or gray—
black pottery, tempered with crushcd

with inéised lines only. The type of

Several long passes executed by

gains. Although using a comparatively
new backﬁeld the Pioneer machine
worked with precision and displayed
a dash and fight which repeatedly
brought the‘ stands to their feet in
applause. The half was featured by
the holding of the Piker line when
their goal was threatened. In mid-
ﬁeld the Pioneers easily opened wide
gaps in the Washington defense but
when their goal was in danger the

The game was featured by the ex-
