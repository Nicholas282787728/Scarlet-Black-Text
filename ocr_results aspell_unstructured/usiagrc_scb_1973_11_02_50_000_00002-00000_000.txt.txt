Board Increase Means
More Meal, New Equipment

by Louise Dix

iThe $25 increase in the board
cost for second semester will be
used for overhead costs and to lmr
prove the quality of the inod served,
according to a letter written by
Waldo Walker, dean ot the college.
Ralph Pomerenk, Director of Food
Services, stated that it snot so much
the quality of the tood that will be
improved as it is the quantity. He
said there will be more meat and
there will be meal "a little more
often.” The ham at Monday'sbreakr
last is an example of the new plan
being put Into action.

Jerry Ramaker, Food Service Di-
rector. added that there would be
“an increase In the frequency ol

Some oi you may remember Alex
Kaplansky’s and my request last
year for letters and post cards
inquiring into the conditions of Dean
Khac Xuyen and Nguyen Dong Ha,
two of the estimated two hundred
thousand political prisoners held
by the Thieu regime. Alex and I
tried to stress the importance of
sustained pressure on the Saigon
government to prevent the widely
feared massacre of these priso-
ners in the scramble following the
Paris peace agreements,

New Approach

The political prisoner issue is im-
portant both in straight humanitarr
ian terms for those involved and
politically, since any postwar re-
conciliation and reconstruction will
largely depend on the Third I‘oi-ce
non—PEG, non-Thieu elements of

solid meats such as chicken, roast
beef and ham,” Pomerenk stated
that $5 out oi every $25 will go
towards this food improvement.

The other $20 will be used for
overhead costs including repairs,
alterations and normal maintenance
costs, said Pomerenk. He said that
$20,000 is needed to replace the
antiquated reflgeration system in
Quad dining room. During “172-73,
refigeratioh equipment was pur-
chased for Cowles dining room and
they plan a similar equipment re
placement for Quad this year, He
said that this is just one of the
things the money will be used Ior.
The total amount that the board
charge will bring in second semes-

ter will be approximately 325,000
more than for first Semester. Pom-
erenk said that the daily rate (three
meals a day) ior students on iull
board is $2.50 and that the rate
will be $2.75 on the new plan,
The liege usually directs 15%
oi the annual charge to overhead
costs, but this year has only been
able to direct less than 5% of the
cost for that purpose. “The cost of
food and labor has risen and there
hasn’t been enough to make up the
diiierence,” Pomcrenk stated, “It
had to be recouped.” He said the
increase is the result of inflation
and it can’t be controlled ”by either
you or me”,

Should Stop Aid

al. The issue should not be aban-
doned, but I must admit that I
have approached it incorrectly.

The massive arrests and impri-

sonments oi dissidents(25,000 since.

the treaty) are a symptom, not a
cause of the failure of the peace
accords. And the accords have fail—
ed precisely because neither the US
nor Thieu seriously intended to imr
plement anything other than a Cease
fire in place which would make
PRG forces more visible and hence
more vulnerable to US ﬁnanced
Saigon “nibbling" operations.
Meanwhile the press distorts the
essentially defensive moves oi PRG
iorces. Peasants in the Saigon zones
are still not allowed to return to
villages controlled bythePRG, Fran
ternization and cooperation between
Saigon and liberation forces and 107
cal commanders, which could pre
vent many of the truce violations
is specifically forbidden by Thieu.
Saigon’s ability to persist in this
ohstructionist attitude and its an,
ility to repress dissent in its own
zones depends on AID, CORDS, and
other US iunding agencies paid with
our taxes.

The actual extent of this depend
once is staggering, far higher than
the already high ortlclal tigures.

Taking indirect as well as direct
forms oi aid (as determined by the
Indochina Research Center and re
ported by Jack Anderson In the
March 26 issue of the Washington
Post) American taxpayers have pro-
vided 90% of all SVN government
expenses tor the last four years.
The prison system and the 125,000
man police iorce comprise a large
part of the “nommilltary” aid bud»
get.

THE POINT: letters can do some
good tor the prisoners and the rest
of Viet Nam; the place to send
them, though, is to your senators
and congressman demanding an end
to all US aid to Thieu or at least
making aid contingent on a bicams
eral investigation of how the money
is being spent and speciIically an
inquiry into conditions in the pri-
son camps which the ICCS has not
examined. I'll have a box in the
mailroom again which Ihope many
or you will use (this helps me

port),

'War’SparIis Team Reaction

by Dave Schechter

MONMOUTH, IL»-“lt wasn’t a
game, it was a war."

These were the words of Grinnell
soccer coach Tom Vanderhyden afa
ter his squad’s 270 loss to Monr
mouth. There were two lights in
the game, a game marred by ex,
cessive roughness, which Vander-
hyden believes was the fault of the
Monmouth team.

As a result, the consensus oi the
Grinnell team, voiced by Captain
Roger Kumler, is that Grinnell shou-
ldn’t play Monmouth again Vander-
hyden has said that he will never
bring another team to Monmouth.
There was one instance where the
Monmouth players were urged to
kick a Grinnell player in the head
who was down on the field.

Monmouth coach Bill Urban Comm—
ented, “Kick in head was more in
the nature of sarcasm.” The Pio-
neer team doesn't agree with that
story. Urban said that Grinnell be-
gan complaining to the reierees
early in the game.

The officials are another source
of controversy, One was a faculty
member and the other is a foreman
in a local plant. The leading referee
Is a former German player who has
been otilciating for a number of
years.

Many members oftheGrinnellteam
feel that the official let the game

get out of control and that it was
their fault that the excessiveyroughe
ness occured. Vanderhyden ex,
pressed the opinion that the refe—
rees were “innocent bystanders
who are catching the bad end oi the
rap.

Urban commented, “I just say that
the Monmouth players wanted it
(the ball) more than the Grinnell
players. .There is a diiierence of
opinion on how much contact is
allowed in the sport or soccer.
Soccer is not volleyball, on the
other hand it is not ioothall. The
diiierence between legal and ill-
egal contact is always a pidgment."
Kumler commented that this sim-
ply isn't true, that the rules at
the game deiine which moves and
fouls are illegal and which moves
are permissible.

Urban continued,
(Monmouth team members) to play
for the ball at all times Obvious-
1y, Grinnell is not used to this,
but this is perfectly respectable
soccer. They way to counter this
is superior dribbling and passing.
We aren’t playing European type
ball yeti”

About the retusal to play Mon-
mouth in the future the Monmouth
coach said, “That’s their choice.
The conference rules require us to
play--I really don't know what can
be done about this." '
