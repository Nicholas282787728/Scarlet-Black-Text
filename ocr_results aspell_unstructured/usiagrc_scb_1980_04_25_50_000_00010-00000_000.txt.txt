Anatomy of a mistake

The Student Publications and Radio Com—
mittee has blundered. And what’s worse,
they don’t even recognize that they have
blundered,

Our problem with the committee’s choice
of Anne Rawland over John Mandel is based
on principle. We have no personal animosity
toward Anne. We think that some day she
could make a fine SSzB editor, but as of now,
she is neither the most qualified nor the most
deserving candidate for the job,

The committee has cited in its original of-
ficial letter of explanation false or highly
questionable criteria for the decision. It is
historically untrue that being off-campus
first semester (Mandel is going to London)
will affect the performance of the editor, In
the past, the committee has approved one
editor~in-chief, two associate editors, and one
news editor to assume their staff duties after
they returned from London.

The original letter asserts that Mandel and
Rawland have equal qualifications. This is
simply not true, and committee members
have admitted that it is not true in a second
letter. Mandel, who will be a senior next
year, has put in six semesters in various

capacities for the S&B. He has been a
reporter for four semesters, a senior con-
tributor for one-half semester, and campus
news editor for one and a half semesters
Mandel has had diverse experience as a
writer: he has written news, feature, sports,
news analysis, and investigative stories.

Rawland’s experience with campus
publications is as follows: two semesters as
a news reporter under the old newspaper for-
mat, two news stories for the newsmagazine,
and that’s it. Can anyone say that this com—
parison shows they have “equal experience”
with campus publications?

Isn’t it astoundingly clear that the commit-
tee doesn’t understand Mandel’s qualifica-
tions as compared to Rawland’s'? Is not this
misunderstanding by itself sufficient cause
for a committee to review its decision?

In meir letter, the committee states that
they preferred Rawland’s philosophy to
Mandel’s of what the newmagazine should
be. They went on to claim that her
philosophy better reﬂected that of the cam~
pus community. When questioned, commit-
tee members had difficulty in expressing
what any of this means. After much hem-
ming and hawing, what it comes down to is a
