Prefers Regular Army to National
Army or Guard—ACllance for
Advancement Better

“The army does not want men he-
tweeir the ages of 18 and 21," was the
statement made hy Captain Arthur
Hutchinson '15, dining an inter-iiew
Monday evening, “A than under '31 is
too restless and too hard to discipline
to be at air real good to the army," he
continued.

In speaking of his own company,
which is stationed at Nol'IOlk, Va., he
said, “i have a number or men in my
company who are is and 19, and I
would like to trade them for glder
men. Ilf I had my way I would have
no one in the company under 21 or
My advice to men or 13 or 19 years oi
age would be to stay in college iintll
it is impossible to get another full
year and then pick their branch of the
sci e before they are dratted."

‘ or men who are now 21 or about
to be 21 it might be advisable to en,
list, since that extra training in the
army nould give them a much better
chance of obtaining a commission,"
said Captain Hutchinson. He declared
himselt very lunch in favor of the reg
ular army in preference to either the

, national guard or the national army,

since the training is iuuch better and
the chance for advancement for great
or,

Captain Hutchinson entered the reg»
ular army a year ago last March slior
ly hetorc war was declared. He state
ed that the 48th regiment, of which his
company is a part, would probalJl)v not
he sent to France, but would be kept
in this country to do guard duty. His
only chance, he thinks, to be trans
{erred to some other tiiiit.

In conclusion he said, “I wish to
back up thc president in everything he
said in chapel Monday morning. He
stated the matter very clearly.”

Hutchinson visited his brother, Royr

Caloco and Institute Will Present
Play by J. M. Barrie on
That Date

“The Adlnirable c cllloll,” by .l M,
Barrie, i\l\lcll was o giually schedule
ed to he played April ti, ill he given
by Calocagathia and institute literary
societies at the Colonial theater on
Friday, May 10, under the direction
oi' Prof. J. P. Ryan.

This play. winch is cousidercd by all
critics to be the best play Bar c cver
wrote and by iar the h t play or his
time, has never been presented in this
country hcl‘ore outside oi New York,
and because oi this a large royalty was
lueeessary to secure it.

The play is the story oi an English
nobleman who despises class distinc-
tion and proves it by having his serr
vztnts in to tea once a mouth, treating
them at this time in the same manner
as any other guest would he treated.
The Earl oi main with his daughters
and servants are later shipwrecked on
a desert island, when the butler,
Crichton, proves that the eail's beliei
in regard to class distinction is true,
much to the discomiort oi the earl.
The play is permeated urth amusing
and ridiculous situations, combined
with an element oi tense dramaticism.

No lead can be selected ier either
the men er the women, as in each case
there are three parts oi equal impo-
tallcc. The Earl of Loam (Frank Wi
covcu), Lord Brackclhurst (Frederic
Pinker), and Mr. Crichton (Chester
intlkenhamei), are the leads [or -thc
gmeu, and Mary (Emily Prouty), Came
brine (Helen Ellel'), and Agatha La
enby (Jeanette Lou 'ey). are the lead—
ing women.

“You are cheating yourseli aud your

in a patiiotic chapel addi- ss Monday
morning. >

“You are cheating the government

you enlist hciorc 21," he continued.
“It is the essence oi chivalry to hide

"The geyermucnt set the drait age
between 21 and 31, because they that
that men between those ages could

they might learn how to serve. You
are not slackers to stay here. We
have military service in Gi'tnnell. Be

emphasized. "I am pleading ior your

President Main emphatically stated
thitt men are not only draited tor the
army, but that they are also drafted
ior service in lite, and that unless they
learn to make the most at that service
their e stellce is of little value, The
best i try to learn, re stated. is to re
