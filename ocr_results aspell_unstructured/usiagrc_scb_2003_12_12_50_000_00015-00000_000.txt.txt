rhe proposed wind farm in Nanrricker sound.

denrs and summer residenrs.

From an environmenral srandpoinr, rhe
wind farm may seem like a grear idea, yer a number ofunderlying
issues exist. The cape Cod canal, physically separasrng Cape Cod
from she resr of Massachusero, divides “year-rounders" from she sige

me cape is highly dependenr on rourism and many locals would like
no see rhis dependence reduoed, l have worked on Cape cod and
have friends whose permmrenr homes are no larger rhan my family's
summer home and whose backyards cerrainly do nor end on a prie

Having experienced, ro some degree, lire in eaeh group, I can
arresr ro rhe inrereso ofeaeh, of imporranse so yurrmund residenrs
are rhe poreirrial economic bencfrrs of a wind farm. According ro

gallons every year Cape Wind argues rhar rhe impacr on bird might»
rions and marine life will be minimal. More imporranrly, movemenr
roward wind power would reduce global warming, responsible for
rho rising sea levels eroding Cape Cod; beaches. Any rediierion of
greenhouse gas emissions, by swirchrng from rradirional ro renew»

rhe Cape, if greenhouse gas emissions are nos reduced, NIMBYeircs
will have bigger problems rhan dropping properryvalues as rhe ocean

eonrinue so resolve some orrhe murkier aspecrs ofrhewrnd farm and
reduce rlre fears ofporenrial wind users aeross rhe narion, allowing
