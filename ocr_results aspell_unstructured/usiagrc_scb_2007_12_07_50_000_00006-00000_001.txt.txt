Anonymous anti Obama poster highlights fierce race

by DAVID Ht MONTGOMERY

Leading Democratic presidential 'cair
didates are engaged in a ﬁerce debate about
the future of health care in America. Here
at Grinncll, the health care debate is at the
heart of sharp posters critiquing Sen. Barack
Obama’s health care proposal. The posters,
which associate Obama’s proposal with those
of leading Republicans, are signed by a non
existent group calling themselves “Grinnell
College Students for Truth."

The posters (seen at right) are not particut
larly vicious but mark an escalation in came
paign rhetoric on campus, particularly given
the anonymous nature of the attack.

The healthcare debate reﬂected in the
posters centers on whether health care plans
should mandate that every American purchase
health insurance. The Edwards and Clinton
proposals include mandates, which they claim
are necessary to achieve truly “universal" health
care and to effectively lower health care costs.
Obama requires that all children have health
insurance but does not include a mandate for
adults.

Fact-checking journalists and political
pundits have divided about the actual met»
its of mandates versus no mandates, Health
policy experts have argued for the superiority
of both types of plans. But in a Democratic

primary with few major policy differences, the
health care debate has taken on new impor-
tallceﬂnd heat.

None ofthe p 'tlcal campaigns on campus
claimed responsibility for the posters. Howev-
er,onrcampus supporters ofEdwards and pos-
sibly Clinton are connected to the posters.

Students for Edwards co-chair Matthew
Horowitz '10 denied any role in actually der
signing the poster, but associated himselfw-ith
the effort, which a friend proposed to him. “I
didn't oppose doing it because it was such an
important issue to me," Horowitz said. “I was
supportive of the idea ofthe poster. I put a
couple up around my dorm."

Horowitz characterized the posters as “an
awareness issue."

“I don’t want it to be associated with any
of the campaigns, because none of the cams
paigns have endorsed doing that," Horowitz
saidl “We'rejust students speaking up for what
we believe in."

Students for Obama leaders on campus
said that they had been told that members
of Students for Hillary group were seen putt
ting up posters in the loggia. The ontcampus
leaders of Students for Hillary, who are also
Clinton interns and not allowed to speak to
the press, declined comment,

“We can’t say for sure who's behind [the

posters]," said Lindsey

“I think it's import
tant to have a candi-
date who srands up for
universal health care,"
Horowitz said, “It's one
of the things that's really fundamental about
this election."

Students for Obama leaders did not receive
authorization from the Obama campaign by
press time to speak about the health care issue.
Obama has consistently argued that mandates
are unnecessary because “the reason people
don't have health insurance isn't because they
don't want it, it’s because theycan't afford it,"
as he was quoted in a Des Moines Register

mandates instead of universal health care.
“That would be the most honest approach

Reporter discovers why GOP hearts Huckabee

BY MARKJAFINGA

Driving to Newton on Tuesday,I couldnt help but question
my own motivcsi didn't think any politician could possibly in
spire me to drag myself out ofbed before 8 am. and sit through
another stump speech, especially a Republican. But not every
Republican can claim he is Chuck Norris approved nor can
he boast that he shot up 17 points in a month in the latest Des
Moincs Register poll.

Only former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee can, and
about 100 pcople braved the morning Iowa cold to see the
former Baptist minister return to Iowa for the first time in a
month to preach the social conservative gospel. Chuck Norris,
unfortunately was not in attendance.

After a brief introduction by Grinnell favorite son and
Huckabee campaign Iowa co-chair Danny Carroll, Huckabee
launched into a stump speech,characterizcd by the mantra that
“unless we make some changes, we might not leave the next
generation better off."

The speech never mentioned who might be impeding the
process, whether it be Bush or the Democrats, but Huckabce's
upbeat tone evoked the sense of optimism that has brought
many conservatives to his campaign and even caused many
Democrats to claim that he is the least of the Republican evils.
I nodded with approval.

Another reason for Huckabee’s bipartisan approval might
be the fact that no other Republican trumpets the importance
ofenergy independence as much as he does. He proposed that

the United states would be “energy independent in 10 years,"

and worried about the relationship between US. foreign policy
and a US. oil addiction.

“We re finnncmg both Sides of the War on Terror," he said.
“we’re the mil‘ ary that rights the war and the country that
funds the terrorists that our m tary rights."

“Thc family is the economic basis of our society...

Ah, there we go,

certainly speak to social conservatives in a way that Giuliani,
McCain,and Romney cannot. His prodifc, pro-family, pro-ﬁs-
cal rcsponsi ility campaign strongly resonated with a number

ofvotcrs with whom I spoke. (That
“We need a ﬂat to Campalgn Notebook Huckabee is, whcn I could speak with them.

Huckabec's popularity erplosion
created so mnth hoopla that when I turned around to had run
other ttentlee to interview, every one of the 20 or so people
still in attendance was talking to someone with a little yellow
notepad.)

“Hes honest, refreshing, and straightforward said Mary
Rethmeier, a Huckabee supporter who saw her favorite cans
didate for the second time Tuesday. “He’s also a candidate that
isn’t going to teeter»tocter," ajab at both the ﬂiptflops of John
Kerry in 2004 and the perceived MassachusettsrtorMiddler
America shift in values by Mitt Romney.

One supporter, Adam Vandall, liked the simplicity of the
Huckabee campaign. “Others have poured millions into their
campaigns and they’re not getting anywhere," he said. “Hucka-
bce is running a ﬁscally conservative campaign and won't
spend us into oblivion." But his conclusion seems a little pre-
maturcl When you've only become the frontrunner in the past
week, you haven't had a chance to spend any surge otcontribu-
tions yet.

One peculiar draw of the Huckabee campaign revolves
around what he doesn't talk about: foreign policy Huckabee’s
only mention of foreign relations came in the abstract, when
he referred to terrorists being willing to blow themselves up
and through passing mentions ofIran and Saudi Arabia when
discussing energy independencciThis was probably intentional.
A story released later that day by The Politico revealed that
Huckabee had not been briefed On the major new National Int
telligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program that had been
released the day prior claiming that Iran had halted its nuclear
weapons program in 2003. This nnght be acceptable for an Arr
kansas governor, but for a presidential candidate?

Yet none ofthc pcoplc I spoke with had any qualms about
Huckabee’s domestic [0Cus. Everyone quickly shrugged it off,
saying some form of quick response on how it didn’t bother
them and citing the other important issues ofthe electioul

And who would be bothered when Huckabee acts like his
usual, affable self, hill or throwaway onerliners and clean jokes
that you would logically etpect your minisrcr to tell? He en-
couraged attendees to tell supporters of other Republicans that
the caucus had been moved to February 15, and if they saw
through that, shovel all ofyour snow onto their driveway.

In all, it made for the most genial spcech I’ve seen this cam-
paign, making _thc tlitrerence bctwccn Huckabee: and Walker,
Texas Ranger seem all the more absurd. But it also provided
convincing evidence that I should end with a chccsy movie refs
ercncc, as it’s eitsy to see why so many chubhcans, especially
sociltl conseivatlvcs, heart Huckabee.
