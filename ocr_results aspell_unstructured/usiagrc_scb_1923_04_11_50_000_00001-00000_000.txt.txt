The proposed changes came about
as the result of a report of the Conr-

mittee of the faculty on Upper-class,

Registration. ThIs committee has
made a study or the sluinkage that
Is so marked between the freshman
and the seniol years. Among the
gIeasons for this shrinkage seemed to
he the diffuseness oi.the rIcshInan
curriculum, the tendency of freslr
men to elect at random, and put oil
required Work till late in the course;
'the breaking down of the distinction
[between freshmen and upperclassmen
through unrestrained choice of elec-
tive, and otheI laxitIes In the can
,culum.

The step toward displacement of
mathematics from Its time—honored
position as an essential study came as
one of the tendencies of modern edus
cational practIce; not that maLhems:
tics is considered any less worth
studying than formerly, out because
experience seems to show that there
are many students of ability who can
prolit more by the concrete training
in labrahIIy science than by the more
abstract processes of mathematics.
‘Tlle recent pressure of new subjects
relating to the social sciences and
business adminrs anion, is also in—
evitably reﬂected In the curriculum

In general arlnncll, through these
changes, maintains a rather moderate
position in the lace of present tend
enei , ,for mathematics is reduced in
many institutions to the rank of a
mere freshman elective, and almost
every subicct in the curriculum, In
some cases, is open to tho franhnnan.

Prof. GI W. Rutheﬂol‘d spent several
days of last Week in Dell Molues on
