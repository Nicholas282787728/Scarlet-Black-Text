TITIANGUIAH DEBATE
IEAGUE IS PLANNED

Carleton, l‘oriiell anti t him-11 will
hold Conieroncc Nt-xt .110th To
Consider Phat #Imhiltu with
Coo Discussed—War nay
Stop Debuting.

A conference between Carleton, Cor—
ucll, and Grihnell was to have been
held last week in Cedar Rapids, for
the purpose of forming a new triangu-

. 1er debating league for the coming sca-

son, but owing to the uncertainty oi
the status of Amellcztll colleges as re»
gztn‘ls the enrollment of men ror next
year because of the present war silua
zttion, this meeting has been postponed
indelinitcly.

At a Debating union meeting held
recently, the plan (or the new triangu-
Ial' was found agreeable, and Mr. E.
r). Strong was chosen as the Council
delegate to this contcrcnce. Carleton
was to have been represented by Pro-
fessol' Cochran and Cornell by PI‘OfeSr
sor Kcister.

Both the Carleton and Cornell auv
thorities had acted upon the plan and
with all three schools regarding the
new triangular lavorabiy, it was con.
sidcrcd probable that the league would
have been tor-med, had not the call
been issued for college men to join the
colors in delcnsc oi their country. Un-
der present conditions, it appears
doubtful if there will be enough men
in college next year to carry on dc-
bating activities.

 

With this triangular arranged the
Gl-inncll-Coe-Cornell triangular would
probably be dropped. Reports iroin
hoth One and Cornell show that there
seems to be no desire at either school
for the continuance of this old league.

Had the conference been held. an
attempt would also have been made by
Mr. Strong to schedule a single debate
between Coe and Grinnell lor next
year. There seems to he no centre at
either school to break off debating re.
laLions, however Just what action
would have been taken by the author-
ities in this respect can not be lore-
told, but the proposition would at‘ least
have been given consideration.

Next Saturday.

German dye makers haven‘t "got
anything" on the students or Grinncli

tion need not rear that their 'next
year's “Easter honnets" will he white
l'ather‘ than their usual color. “sky

iacture of dyes will soon be made pub~
he. to every student at the institution.
At the same tirne all the mysteries
connected with the manufacturing ol
high explosives and other “powder"
will be divulged ror the benefit or the
“lesser hztlf" of the school.

The above is only a part of an elab-
orate program in the process of prcp-
aration by the Chemical Club tor the

“open house" to be held at Blair hall
Saturday evening, April 21. at 8:00 o‘-
clock, An invitation is extended to ev-
ery person in the institution to he
prcscnt at this informal program.

The Chemical Club was organized
during the early part of the present
school year and is one of the younger
organizations of the college. The
membership is composed of students
in all branches or chemistry from the
“men" to the oldest member on the
laculty. The club has held meetings
twice a month at which papers were
read by different members on same

phase or problem of Chemistry, The
club is giving the “0an house” for the
benefit of those persons interested in
modern chemistry, although they may
ncver have entered into a protracted
study or the subject. Further an-
nouncements as to the program will he

BIG BREEZE TD DIDW SDDII?

1918 Cyclone Is Expected To Anion:
Enrly III )[uy—Will Be it “Grill-
lIt-ll Clnsslc."

With the balmy sp ng breezes waft
ing their wzty over the campus, the
idea has occurred to some that the
“big breeze," the 1918 Cyclone, will
probably make its appearance some-
time soon. As usual, the Annual Board
are close-lippcd concerning the plans
{or their book, and will divulge none
of its secrets, but the observing ones
have been Watching the Cyclone ba-
i'olnetel', and they predict a visit or the
big book to the campus early in May.

Several members of the Board stoyr
ed in Grinnell during the vacation Just
past, presumably to work on the book,
and Fi‘ldlund and Hazard, editor and
business manager respectively, made
a trip to Minneapolis during vacation
to y it the Coiwell Press, where the
bunk is being printed. If such “dope"
is Worth anything at all, it points to
the i'zict that most of the copy is in the
hands or the printers, and that the
1913 Cyclone is really becoming a inh-
tcrial thing.

Several leaturc sections are promis—
ed by the Board, but their nature is
only a matter or conjecture. 1t is
known that the book will have a great
number or illustrations, and that in
every way it is Well fitted to be a real
“Grinnell Classic."
