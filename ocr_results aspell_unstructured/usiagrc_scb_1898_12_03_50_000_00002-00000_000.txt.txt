IT is interesting to note the
claims which are being put forth
to the state championship on the
gridiron this tall. Nearly every
institution in the state with the
exception of the State Univeisity
and Grinnell seems to be able to
prove to its own satisfaction a
right to the state championship,
it o'n no other grounds than that
they were unable to secure games
with the larger colleges. It is dif-
ﬁcult to see why they do not tor
the same reasons claim the cham-
pionship for the whole country.

THE SLIGHT recognition which
the president made on Friday
morning of the work of this year’s
toothall team was exceedingly
gratifying to all wllo heard it.
While we do not go so tar as to
ask that our athletic victors should
be allowed places on the platform
with the faculty, yet it is pleasing
to note that the faculty is Inter
.ested in thc athletics.of the stur
dents. As was said, the college
is represented by the athletic
teams, debaters, musical organi-
zations and other phases of Slur
dent activity, and since this is so
it is the desire of all connected
with the college that this repler
sentation should be the best pos
sible. The accompanying remark
which the president made is one
that it would be well for the stue
dents to ponder over. It is only
too true that during the athlctic
season students will spcncl hours
conversing on_ no other subject
than on the athletic sport which
happens to be dominant at that
time. One of the most helpful
things of college life is the assocIr

ation of fellow students and the
exchange ot thoughts and experi-
ences which affect the lives of
each. It is very evident that this
association is not brought about
by such tI'iVIal conversation as tor
the most part takes place between
students.

The lack of biblical knowledge
among college students is well
shown by this statement. “The
tollowing questions, submitted to
96 persons in Northwestern Uni-
versity, brought out results which
are too often characteristic of cola
lege students:

i. What is the' Pentatcuch?

2. What is higher criticism?

3. Does the book of Jude be-
long to the 01d or the New Testa-
ment?

4. Name one of the patriarchs
of the Old Testament.

5. Name one ot the judges ot
the Old Testament.

6. Name three ot the kings ot
Israel.

7. Name three prophets.

8. Give one of the beatitudcs.

9. Quote a verse from the let
ter to the Romans.

or the 96 persons 35 were un-
able to tell what the Pentatcuch
is, eight answered all correctly,
and three answered none at all.”
