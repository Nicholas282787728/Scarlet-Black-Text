Time for Grant of ’\
Money to College
Extended to 1930

According to an announcement in
the current Grinuell and You by
President drain, the General Educa~
tion Board has extended the period
for completing the conditions ot the
$500,000 grant oItered hy the beard
to‘-April 1930, when the college must
show $1,000,000 in caslr .or valid
pledges seccired since 1921, and no
indebtedness.

Over $1,000,000 has been collected
in cash, securities, real estate, and
pledges since the present endowment
campaign was undertaken in 192:. In-
debtedness Ior- noneprotlllotlve pul'r
poses amounts to $250,000, which rrrust
be paid cit hetore the board's otter
will be lultilled.. Tire college owns
equities which, with the unpaid
pledges, will he nrore than sutticient
to pay this debt.

"During this entire campaign pere
ind," says President Main, “which
has been characterized throughout
Iowa by a very great iinancial de-
pression and disturbance, the college
has been steadily on the up grade,
The campaign has gone forward in
spite of the commonly accepted beliet
that it would not succeed. ”The cone
ditions make it impossible,’ was the
current phrase. Nevertheless our
standards of admission have been
strengthened; the college has not
been willing to admit students beyond
its capacity to deal adequately with
them. The morale ot the student
community and, faculty has been
achieved during the carrrpaign period
(in spite oi all adverse circum-
stances) a condition or unquestioned
financial stability. We have every
reason to rejoice at the present situe
ation and to look to the future with
confidence.”
