Terror: Prevention for the terrified Tiles“!!!

Inside my mailbox is a letter proclaiming, “Get a
Guaranteed Position As a Marine Corps Officer Be-
fore You Graduate." As I leave my English class, two
tall soldiers in camouflage stand in mud, smiling tene
tatively at passcrs-by.

Some friends and I laugh, “They must be pretty
desperate."

I knew someone was desperate for warm bodies
to replace Americans killed in Iraq a few months ago,
when the New YorkTimcs ran a propagandistic fentuie
on the comfortable llvrng accommodations ofsoldiets
stationed in lmq. This included photographs of sole
diers playing videogames and comparison of barracks
to dorms with all the comforts of home. (The authors
brieﬂy mentioned that such luxury was mmhsomc
soldiers lived holes with inadequate nutrition.)

The sight ofthese tall men standing in ARI-I feels
even more surreal than the thirdy disguised attempt at
recruitment by a widely read us. newspaper.

The "Official Website for the United States Mar
rine Corps" features an advertisement video about
what the site refers to as, “the global war on terrorism."
As the camera cuts to a U.S. soldier staring out from
behind the barrel ofa gun, a voice intones, “We are not
conquering; we are liberating."

If the armed forces conﬂate libera-
tion with violence, how free are we?

In the past year, two 16ryearrold
Muslim girls in New York were der
tained and locked in jail with no con-
tact with their families and no legal
counsel because ofﬁcials wrongly as
sumed they were terrorists. Prisoners at Abu Gharib
were tortured with impunity for the highest-ranking
ofﬁcials responsible. Prisoners at Guaranamo continue
to endure torture by US. ofﬁcers, and the US. presir
dent and vice president are pushing to give the Central

Intelligence Agency the freedom to torture anyone.

The Marine Corps advertisementvideo proclaims,
“The president told everybody long ago you're either
with us or you’re against us, and ifyou’rc harboring and
keeping terrorists in your country, we’re gorng to come
and get them,”

Ideas about how to “conic and get" the people who
dominant political and economic interests have labeled
“terrorists” have exploded as
politicians and pundits put
forth their ideas. New York
Times writer Paul Sperry
advocated racial profiling.

He argued that “young
men praying to Allah and
smelling like ﬂower water"
should be targeted as terrorists,‘

New YorkTimes writer Haim Watzman advocated
not only violation of civil liberties but also murder in
order to ensure feelings of security.2 Watzman dis-
cussed thc case of Jean Charles de Menczcs, an int
nocent unarmed Brazilian murdered by police officers
in London. The officers shot Menezes with multiple
bullets for no reason other than fear that this dark-
skinned man seemed to fit the proﬁle ofa terrorist.

Too many people in positions
of power have accepted Watzman's
ﬂawed argument that “We do ter-
rible things only when it is necess
sary to prevent something worse
from happening.”

Menezes' murder by law en-
forcement ofﬁcials epitomizes the attitude occupying
governments encourage in their citizens. Mainstream
media overlook the fact that this murder prevented
nothing. There ms nothing that indicated to reason-
able observers that Menezcs could have been a threat.

He was an innocent man murdered because police
thought he looked like a terrorist.

While human rights groups strive to publicize the
prevalence of torture at the hands of US. ofﬁcials, the
government tiles to redraw the terms of debate. Tor-

the mainstream media debate over the utility of Mme,

obscures the true crisis.

lated around the world?

The effects of torture are not preventative. As the
United States willfully detains suspiciousrlooking
people as criminals and violates their human rights,
heightened ant'rAmerican sentiment becomes a tool
for mobilization and recruitment of terrorists.

Here’s a suggestion for fellow literature students
who run into army recruiters in the hallway: redeﬁne
the “War on Terror" as a battle against the fear that
makes murder in the name of “prevention" palatable.
The Grinnell college 50112 Zip code is not terriﬁed
enough to deprive people oflife based on appearance
or religion.

So what can I do to prevent more advertisements
by the Marines from teaching my mailbox?

However a few short months in Senegal
have done much to alter my perception
ofchildten in society

In truth, I didn’t spend much time
thinking about children in the U. 5. Kids
were kids, usually- thankfully— someone
elses responsibility. Senegalese children
refuse to be ignored.

Touching every aspect of society,
they're inescapable in both the bur-
den they represent and in their incred»
ible, inherent promise. The 4.7 million
children of Senegal can at times inspire
pity, even gniilt but they also provoke
thought.

In economic terms, the country con,
tinues to lead much of West Africa in
overall growth and structural improve-
ment. Dakar represents a regional capi»
tal for foreign investment and internals
tional made, but a great deal remains to
be done. Our well-intentioned gen-
eration (Africans and westerners alike)
can’t hope to accomplish the necessary
progress. Senegal, and hopefully the
whole of Africa, will rise by and for the
likes of Daba, Jean Jacques, Suzy, Tony,
Michou, Frankie and Marni.
