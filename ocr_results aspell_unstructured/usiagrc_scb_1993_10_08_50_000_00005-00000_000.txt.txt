Smoking Debate Does Not Need to Divide Campus

By Kelley Wagers

MAGINE its August again
I and youarc opening thcdoor

on your new home, room-
mate, and life. Through the thick
haze enveloping your abode for
the next ten months, you see a
httman Chimney tacking old
Marlboro ads to the walls. Or,
y the same token, innocently
smoking your first cigarette as a
college student, you open the
door to an air purifier and an
onslaughtofairfresheners. Both
situations could obviously lead
to problems. Even if there is no
conflict between roommates,
though, for many Grinnellians
living in close quarters with so
manyandsuchavariety ofpeople
is a new experience, especially
considering the issue of smok-
ing. All students must be able to
live healthily and comfortably,
both within the residence halls
and in other buildings on camv
pus.

As far as the residence halls
go, both smokers and non-smok-
ers contend that the issue is a
matter of compromise and con-
sideration. The Grinnell Col~
lege Student Handbook states
that students may restrict smok-
ing on their floor or as an entire

residence hall. In both cases, a
petitions signed by thirty percent
of the occupants will bring the
issue to discussion and a seventy
percent majority vote will fur-
ther restrict smoking. However,
in interviewing both smokers and
nonsmokers, I found that most
held the opinion that a compre-
mise could be reached suitable to
both sides without these formali»
ties. They said that people smok-
ing in their room with the door
closed and a fan on or window
open, posed little problem to ei-
ther side. As first year student
and smoker Amy Dona stated,
“It‘s a matter of consideration
and respect of space, like not
leaving yourdirty dishes around."

This same consideration for the
rightsofbothsmokers and nonrsmokr
ers can exist campus-wide. It is im-
portant that smokers know and re-
spectsmokingresu-ictions,espccially
in places of social gatherings such as
the Forum and Bob’s Underground.
In the Forum, smoking is permitted
only on the WestTerraceofthe Grill.
North Lounge if no events are schedr
tried, and PDR's C and D. Returning
students may remember discussions
concerning smoking in Bob’s last
year thatresulted in a new policy this
year. Now, smoking is permitted in

resulted in an “overall business in-

Campus Diversity, Culture, and
. ttitudes are Divided North/South

By Howard B. Horn

MERICA was slowly Zip
proaching its centennial.

The nation had prospered

tits short history, and the “contro-
ersial" idea of democracy worked.
’etdespitetitesesuccesscs,America
as suffering from a deep division
etwcen the north and the south, A17
tough both regions were part of
merica, both regions had their own
parate and distinct charaCteristics.
'hese characteristics led to a bloody
air that killed thousands of people.
Grinnell College suffers from
imilar polarization. As this college
pproachesus sesquicentennial,deep
ivisions separate north campus and
0th campus. Although these dif—
crcnces arenot likely to cause blood-
hed on the scale of the American
ivilWar,theyarestillworthnoting.
An easy explanation for these
ifferences is geogmphy. “locks"
ant easy access to the PEG; there-
ore they tend to live on north camv

pus. “Cultural” types want easy ac-
cess to the Fine Ans Building; there
fore they tend to live on south cam-
pus. But (as easy explanations often
are), this doesnet tell the whole story.

people similar to them. This leads to
a different north and south campus
culture. South is the liberal side.
l-lippies live there. Political concei-
ness is practiced often. Gays. inter-
national students, and minority
American students tend to live south.
Illegal drug use is more common on
south. Anthropology is a popular
major.

Northem culture varies greatly.
North is the more conservative side
of campus (there are stickers dotting
northcampusproclaiming“Grassley
Works“ when Republican Senator
Charles Grassley isn’t due for re-
election until 1998). Yuppies live
north. Political correctness is often
disregardedthere. North campus has
a greaterpercentage of whitestmight,
American Protestants. Beer is the

mtoxicant ofchoice. Economics is a
popular major for people living on
north campus.

Just look at the dining areas.
Quad is laid back andGOllllciaplaCe
where someone can eat lunch and
contemplate the meaning of eating
lunch. Cowles is busy and fume
tionalia hectic place where a mil-
lion dollar business meal might be
taking place behind your back.

Is there a chance that these con—
ditions may change? Remember, al-
though retuming students get to pick
what side oicampus they are going to
liveon,ﬁrstyearsareplacedindorms
by Housing. Firstyearsludents make
up over a third of all students living
on campus. Since first years do not
have a choice about where they live,
their attitudes may not adhere to the
attitudes of the side of campus on
which they live. If ﬁrst years can
neutralize their dorms, things will
change, and bloodshed can be
avoided.

spoke with said they solved any prob-
lem by stepping outside to smoke.
Smoking is not permitted in Harris
Center.

Learning to live with other
people, especially in a tightcommu-

nity such as Grinnell will take some
compromise and some consider
ation. Remember that both smokers
and nonsmokers are enacting a per-
sonal choice that should be re-
spected.
