by Carly Schuna

onThursday, May 1, a suspicious male
is thought to have entered several r:sid:ncc
halls on the Gtinn:ll college campus and
made attempts to talk to students and ens
tet residence hall rooms-[he man was even
mallyoonfronted by the Grinnell police and
told to stay offeollege property,

Thursday night Gtinnell students tee
cerved an all-campus email from Security

5'9", [wtrh] short dark hair, glassu, wear»
ing a green T.shirr, blue jeans, in his 30's."
Btiscoe went on to say the man “may be
mentally unstable," but that he did not
appear to be harmful. The man was said to
have been driving a green Dodge pickup
truck Students were advised to luck their
doors.

Later that night, a second email in»
formed students that tcsidcncc halls would
remain on 24»haut lockdown until the sus-
picious male was “contacted by the polioe."
