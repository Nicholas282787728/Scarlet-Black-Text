Iowa in

BITS AND PlECES—-Chuck
oiinham of nearby Deep Rlver is
one of Iowa‘s more unusual
newspaper publishers, His Deep
River Record is usually one eight
column sheet which comes out
about once a week. It may be
small. but it's wellrread, because
Dunllam doesn't hesitate to ex-
press strong opinions in his
column. Chuck‘s Chirps.

After deliberating 90 minutes. a
jury convicted Dunharrl of assault
and fined him $75.

Recently. he was visited by two
agents of the lowa Department of
Revenue. He told them off in no
uncertain terms—so strongly, in
fact. that one agent filed assault
charges against Dunham.

It's doubtful that this will stop
the fiery journalist, whose first
love is the linotype machineithat
ancient and dying master of
typesetting that allowed the birth
of masscirculation newspaper to
be born.

Review

Des Moines Register cartoonist
Frank Miller quipped, in a drawing
oi one of his famous “monster
trucks,” “If you don‘t leave us
alone, we'll start going around
Iowa.” Miller's question: Is that a
threat or a promise“?

++++

And then there's the tale of the
great Iowa City hoax. Police
received calls from about a dozen
people reporting a huge monster
with white fur and huge orange
eyes that was terrorizing areas of
the city

But alas, Loch Ness lovers, it
was just a hoax.

Authorities declined to file
charges against the six teen-age
perpetrators of the hoax.

+++

Those of you unfamiliar with
small towns might find some of the
traffic on the local police radio
unusual. People who monitor the
public service bands in major
cities are used to following murder
and violence daily from the
comfort of their living room easy
chairs.

ln Grinnell, it is much more
likely to be a request for a car to
check out people “helping them-
selves" to corn in a Iield at the
edge of town.

That’s really rather comforting
for those wanting to escape the
tensions of the city,
