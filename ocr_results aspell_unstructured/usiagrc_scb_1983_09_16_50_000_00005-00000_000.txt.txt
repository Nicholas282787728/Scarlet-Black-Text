“Brothers” in

Editor’s Note: Neither intentional
omission rlor regrettable oversight
prevented the anonymous ”A
Clockwork Orange” letter from up-
pearing in the Scarlet and Black. In
point of fact, this paper never receiv-
ed a copy 0/ the letter.

Besides having been improperly handl-
ed, the controversy surrounding “A
Clockwork Orange” has failed to define
the fundamental issue inherent in such a
film, while the S&B has printed several ar-
ticles defending Kubrick's film, the
original letter criticising “A clockwork
Orange” remains unpublished. whether
an international omission or a regrettable
oversight, the Sim, perhaps in conjunction
with son, has presented a single-edged
argument thus forfeiting impartial, objec
tive journalism. In focusing solely on the
conflict between freeewill and the ex-
cessive violence it seems to engender, the
articles in last week's 5&3 miss the cen
tral criticism oi Kubrick's him. The pro
blem with this film is not simply the theme

Scarlet & Black

of Violence: the problem is the theme of
misogynlstic violence.

in a particularly confusing paragraph,
Robert Quashie wonders ”Why this letter
had not appeared last year during the
‘Three Stooges‘ festival. Maybe it should
appear before the opening credits of
‘Woody Woodpecker'." in an assumed
iiumorous tone revealing underlying
hostility, Quashie trivializes the critical
letter and denegrates Anonymous view
Perhaps a more suited analogy would be
the controversy surrounding the excessive
violence in “Apocalypse Now” used to
demonstrate the horrors of the Vietnam
War. Further into the paragraph Quashie
writes “[blut, surely no man versus
man... violence posed a problem for
Anonymous" thus inadvertently stumbling
upon the basis of the criticism Of “A
Clockwork Orange” (man versus woman
violence) without realizing its full implica
tions In further analyzing the theme of
violence, Quashle negates his former in
sight by stating ”(why must admit that we
are all brothers in sin... We are all capable
of maiming, killing or raping.” Obviously
Quashie's “we” refers to ”the
brotherhood of man,“ for women are not
the sinners in rape, and women are not the
sinners in this film “A Clockwork

Once Upon a Curriculum

Jim Hunter

"The Faculty convened Monday for its
longeawaited vote on academic reform,
but somehow didn't quite get around to it ”
758413 November 13, 1970.

Holed up, deep in the basement of Burle
ing Library, seeking to avoid any serious
academic pursuits this cub reporter
engaged in one of his favorite pursuits,
perusing old 5&B's. i happened, not entire-
ly by accident, upon an account of the 1970
curriculum debate which culminated in
our current set of Curriculum re-
quirements.

it all began in the spring of 1970, when
Beryl Cloti'elter put forth “The Clotfelter
Proposal”, which called for the abOlISh'
ment of all general requirements at Grin~
nell College. In the shuffle of closing the
college in the aftermath of Kent State,
nothing new appeared in the 5&8 concern-
ing this proposal until October id, 1970
when the headline appeared, “Faculty Res
iect Clottelter Proposal”, 5&5 reporters
wrote, “ The marginal and contested 4542
vote culminated four weeks of lackluster
debate, parlimentary boondoggles and
faculty apathy.” There seems to have been
some question as to the Validity of the
results, “There appear... to have been
more votes than there were faculty
members to vote."

The October 23rd headline read, "Facul-
ty Debate Bogs; Professors Exchange
Words". This appears to have been one of
the more heated debates of the series In
the interest of diplomacy and good
studentrfaculty relations 1 find it prudent
to spare the reader the details.

By October 29, the debate became even
more enmired, with counter proposals and
amendments proliferating. 3&1; reporters
John Pepper and Tim Porges decribed the
proceedings, “The debate which ensured
recapitulated earlier meetings ranging
from the technical to the demuncratory to
the eschatological.“

The closing paragraph of the article cap»
tures the feelings of cynicism mat were
setting in, “The meetings are still open (oh
joy) to students, and every minute oi two
hours long it is work noting that the
faculty has consistently evidenced sincere
and categorical unanimity as to the time of
day."

As the debate continued, the Clotfeller
proposal evolved into the “Walla Jones-
clotielter proposal” and now included
plans for a freshman tutorial. The $843
reporters reduced their account to terse

statements, such as: “Debate was opened
again on Walls Jones Clotfleter, The facul-
ty voted not to vote, The faculty voted to
adjourn The faculty adjourned."

The meeting held during the week of
November 20, 1970 opened with an empaSr
sioned speech by SGA President Andy
Loewi, in which he called for “the im-
mediate adoption of the Wall- Jones
Clotfelter proposal." He argued that there
was a crisis of relevance with the current
curriculum, and showed impatience with
the faculty debates, “He quoted from a
book that called curriculum debate by
faculties a ‘great indoor sport' with little
meaning for students." The faculty also
seemed to be growing impatient, as a
number of professors addressed the
assembly on the meaninglessness of the
debate, Fiaiilly the faculty voed to adopt
the Wall- Jones- Clotfelter propsoal,
perhaps as much out of exhaustion as
anything This estabished the current '
quirements of the tutorial and a major,
One of the choice passages from this final
meeting which characterizes debates on
education is attributed to Professor of
History Alan R. Jones, .. All of higher
education is full of unanswered questions;
to wait for answers is to do nothing."

But now the cub reporter must justify
this little journey through time amidst the
microfilm in Burling Library by answer-
ing the question- how does it relate to the
current curriculum issue"

To answer this question i turn again to
Professor Jones. Nearly thirteen years
after the 1570 curriculum debate, Jones
delivered a message to the class of 1983, at
their Baccalaureate ceremony. The
message was “Question authority."

Besides providing us all with a good
laugh at the expense or the faculty, Pepper
and Porges' accounts of the 1970 debate
help put the whole process into perscpcc-
live. It becomes clear that there is no
superior logic or rationality in the way in
which the faculty decides the fate of the
students in terms of requirements. By br-
inging the faculty down from their
pedestal, the accounts help us to question
their authority when it concerns the
academic fate of future Grinnell students
Therctore I urge you to attend the taculty
meeting on the 26th in the words of Pep~
per and Forges, “The faculty senate
moves periorce slowly, but it remains the
best show in town, All students are en-
cou aged to attend.”

the Sin of NI

Orange” is not simply a film about maim-
ing and killing, it is a film about raping,
and in that definition lies the revelation
that you are all brothers in sin,. Films
about killing and maining do not generate
the kind of controversy which follows “A
Clockwork Orange" because in such films
there exists an equality of power: man
fighting man, The crime of rape and the
films which portray it, however, involve a
power dynamic: man/men raping woman,
The outrage towards both rape and "A
Clockwork Orange” represents the
rebellion of women, the attempt by women
to dissolve this power inequity

The power dynamic in “A clockwork
Orange" results in a distinct difference in
response between female and male
viewers. The postesexualel'evolutional‘y-
America myth or androgyny tthat there
eXists no difference between woman and
man) leads us to believe that “A
Clockwork Orange" elicits similar
responses from women and men.
However, when confronted with the Crime
of rape, the falsehood of this myth
becomes apparent. A woman Viewing “A
Clockwork Orange” responds not only with
disgust and repulsion but also with ex-
treme personal fear. A woman can only
hope for escape from the atrocities she
witnesses, and the only hope lies in male
protection (read: female subordination).
The showing of this film serves to
perpetruate the abuse and subjugation of
women.

Men on the other hand are supposed to
see such a film, realize their mistakes. and
mend their heinous ways. The film serves
as an educationg tool, The faulty assump
tion inherent in this analysis is that men
desire education. For a man to embrace
such education he would necessarily have
to relinquish the power he wields by virtue
of his penis. He would have to accept
women as equals, he would have to see
women as other than sex objects; he would
have to renounce the notion of his right to

isogyny

women. In short, men would have to give
up their privileged position in this society
resulting in the end of the patriarchy, the
end of male domination, Is this a
reasonable expectation of “A Clockwork
Orange"?

"A man must retain choice" thus
Quashle answers this question, Was Joe
refuses to forfeit the artistic license of
“creative Violence" 7 a phrase also ap~
propriate to pornography One hopes these
men emphatically condemn the act of
rape, however, one professes that man
must retain the choice to rape, and one
defends the right to portray rape. The two
choices do not exist separately from one
another; they exist concurrently and
necessarily perpetuate one another.
Without the portrayal of women as rape
objects (a necessary consequence of rape
portrayal), it is conceivable that men
would not see women as objects to rape,
The choice to portray rape, artistically or
pornographically, cannot be isolated from
the choice to commit rape Statistics
demonstrate the result of men's choice:
one in three women is raped in her
lifetime.

Finally there remains the question of
Grinnell's egotistic view of itself as a
societal anomaly. In an atmosphere where
any sexual reference meets general itself»
conscious approval, where movie sex
scenes elicit anythingfrom nervous move-
ment to repressed laughter to offensive
catcalls, it seems questionable to see Grin-
nell as anything other than a reﬂection of
society at large. To where has Robert
Quashie’s critical Grinnell audience disap»
peared whilea band ofsly imposters slip in
to laugh at the rape scene in “A Clocknork
Orange”? Grinnell is not an island unto
itself, it is not so different from the 'real
world’ as it supposes and this includes the
area of misogyny, should Grinnell truly
wish to distinguish itself from the society
at large perhaps it might begin by condem-
ning misogyny and misogynistic violence
in all its forms, actual and figurali\e

Pseudo-liberalism at Grinnell

Ben Johnston

This is my third year at Grinnell and let
me tell you that in three years one can
build up a lot of complaints I suppose that
writing for the Slim is one way to air these
complaints Perhaps the biggest Come
plaint I have is the general attitude at this
place. I like the people. i like the campus.
m not overjoyed about the location but I
guess one could say that I like that too.
What I don't like is the pseudo-liberalism
and issues relating to it that i am going to
write about in this column.

i suppose that you could say this article
will be conservative in nature, Consere
vative would probably be a good word for
it, but I dislike using it because idiots like
Jesse Helms give Conservatism a bad
name. Pseudo-liberalism is an ideology,
but i think that there is more than left
wing reactionarianism. The pseudo-liberal
is as blind, unthinking, convinced about
the rightousness of his position, and stuck
into his own mental quagmire just as sure-
ly as is the most staunch, unthinking,
moral majority “conservative" you can
think of.

The pseudoeltberal and pseudo
conservative are really nothing more than
two sides of the same coin- kind of like
Begin and Arafat, if you will. Like the
Moral Majority, pseudoeliberals generally
mean well but are just as ignorant and
ready to resort to rhetoric as the “conserr
vative "

i can’t really say that one specific thing
brought about my ideas about “pseudo-
liberalism.” The effects of two years here
have been cumulative, I can share a few
incidents that helped form my thoughts.

The Dieeln of two years ago was certainly
one. Although i iound the counter
demonstration obnoxious and in poor
taste, I also found it one of the funniest
things I have ever seen in my life and It
seemed to point out the absolute exaspera-
tion i felt while watching a bunch of people
lie down in the middle Ola field pretending
to be dead in order to protest nuclear war
A letter writing session would have pro
bably accomplished more than a Dieeln,
but this certainly wouldn't have had the
same ego-stroking effect. That whole inci-
dent is a classic case of pseudOrliberalism,

The Marines coming to visit the campus
is another good example oi pseudo-
liberalism. A couple days before the
Marines arrived there were signs posted
which listed all the ”exciting" career op
portunities in the Marine Corps Someone
scrawled across on one of those Signs:
“Kill and burn little babiesl" Another per
son more witty than the first wrote
underneath it: “At U.S. Governineni ex-
pense.” The Sign remained that way for
about two days, then another wit of a dif-
ferent political persuasion wrote: “Kind or
like federally funded abortions." That Sign
did not last until lunch. It‘s hard to believe
that a true liberal would rip down a sign
simply because he did not agree with what
was Written on it

Eventually the Marines did show up at
the Forum to talk to interested students.
What was waiting for them when they are
rived? A group or students masturbating
their own egos at the expense of the group
of Marines
