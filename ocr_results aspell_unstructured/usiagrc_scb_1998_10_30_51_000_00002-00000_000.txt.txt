Fund for Excellence
proposals submitted

Thirty-nine Fund for Excellence
proposals have been submitted by
Grinnell College students, facultyand
staffto President Russell K. Osgood” 5
ofﬁce.

They include proposals to increase
the number of multicultural students
on campus, create a center for prairie
studies, upgrade the equipment at col-
lege radio station KDIC, fund a five
year community of teachers project,
add several cross—disciplinary pro-
grams and upgrade computer and inv
formation technologies.

“We have given copies of all 39
proposals to Stewart Library so com-
munity members can have the oppor-
tunity to review the proposals,”
Osgood said. “We encourage feed-
back about the proposals."

Osgood plans to make a final an-
nouncement in mid-December about
which proposals will be funded.

“It is likely that only a handful of

the proposals will be funded from the
Fund for Excellence,” he said.

As the February I998 meeting, the
college’s board oftrustees side aside
a $5.7 million Fund for Excellence.
The goal ofthe fund is to give future
students a better education andio help
position Grinnell for the future. Stu-
dents, faculty and staff were encoure
aged to create initiatives and develop
proposals that would help achieve the
highest level of excellence possible,
according to Osgood.

“Themain purposeofGrinnell Col-
lege isto bea liberal arts college of the

ﬁrst rank,” he said. “We recognized
thatthe college's continued success is
tied to the \vellrbeing ofthe commu-
nity in which the college is located,
onnnellianshavcrespondcd withpro-
posals that have been carefully con—
sidered and well planed, We want to
share our ideas with the community at
large."

The newest Mystery Object has elic-
ited some interesting responses and
one in particular from Around’s long-
time nemesis OLE COUNTRY BOY
who refuses to identify himself.

“It’shard to tell from thepicture,”he
says in his anonymous typewritten let-
ter,“Buthillguessit’s abottle opener.
However, ifit is ﬂexible, it could be a
hinge from a tmnk or chest.”

One reason for running this M0 at
this time Is because it so clearly rer
sembles a Halloween mask but leave it
to Harvey Mikel to hit the nail on the
head by turning the MO sideways Into
a more recognizable position and call-
ing it a gate latch, which is exactly
what it is.

Fastened on a post, says Mikel, the
two little metal pieces drop down and
hold the gate shut. If you ﬂip them up
the gate will open. It depends on which
side you are on, he adds.

Most of these gate latches are found
outside town, he surrnises, probably
many on cemetery gates.

And adding to the evidence in favor

ofagatelatchisJohnBenncttofLaurel
who also recognizes it as such, most
probably from an old-time gate.

The MO, you may recall, comes
from the Lloyd Sparks in Lynnville
and was found in Michigan in pose
sessions belonging to theirdaughter‘s
husband’s grandmother (whew!).

So now that little mystery is solved.

a

Two momentous events will con-
verge Saturday as hunters descend on
the area for the opening early that
morning of the pheasant season and as
children prepare forthe annual rite that
evening of Tricks or Treats.

Both events bring excitement and
pleasure to their respective aﬁciona»
dos at each end of the generation gap,
and both also inspire words ofcaution.

Unfortunately this year hunters, in
addition to being concerned about gun
safety, are being wanted to watch out
for clandestine methamphetamine
laboratories or dump sites which could
prove to be extremely hazardous.

Hard to believe that Mother Nature
is being asked to hide these monstrosi»
ties but the reality ofthe matter is that
she is, and words to the wise to that
effect have been issued by law en»
forcement authorities.

Let us hope that the same is not true
for children out tnck-or—treating but
there are other hazards such as excited
or careless costumed beggars crossing
streets in front of passing cars.

Let us wish both groups safe pas-
sage,

Undefeated Tiger football team
to battle rival Pella tonight

by KRISTI NIXON
Sports editor

Picture this, Fella, Nov. 10, 1997:
Grinnell High School’s football team
was stunned in the quarterﬁnal round of
the football playoffs by the Little Dutch,
14711, ending the Tlgers’ season.

Now picture this, Nov. 11, 1997: A
group of Tigeis beginning to prepare
themselvesbothmentallyandphysically
for Friday, Oct. 30, 1998.

It all boils down to this, Grinnell has
the opportunity to tum the tables on
Fella.IftheTigetsdefeattheLittleDutch,
their 1998 football season is over.

“We have to win this game to get into
the playoffs," says Pella Co-Coach Matt
Schulte. “Then it will come down to a
number of points between us and

Charlton. We have to come out and not
make any nustakcs and keep on Impron

ing like we have done in the last five
weeks.“

Grinnell Coach Jim Dunne says that
his team have last year’s finish burned in
their memory.

“Obviously, emotions will be very
high for the football game,“ he says.
“Pella beat us in Iheplayoffs last year, we
have a lot of kids who played in that
game and they remember’that."

Schulte says that this will be a great
game to watch with consideration ofthe
team rivalry.

“Thesekids have been playing against
each other for six years now for our
seniors," he says. “It has been pretty
competitive every year. It always is an
enjoyable game to watch. I see it as one
of the big games to watch in the state of
Iowa. We are looking at it as a huge
game."

Dunne agrees, “This has been a great
rivalry over the last 15 years. It has been
a great rivalry."

Fella, according to Schulte, looks
healthy for the upcoming game. Dunne,
however, says Grinnell has lost senior
defensive end Travis Arment for this
one.

“Travis deﬁnitely will not play," he
says. “He will be out with a knee injury
and we are really going to miss him for
this game. Otherthan that, weoughttobe
ready to go."

Adam Wallace, according to Dunne,
will be fine for Friday's game.

Itlooksto beapretty interesting match
up. Fella is big and Grinnell is speedy.

“I think we match up pretty well,"
Schulte says. “We don‘t have the speed
that Grinnell does, but we have enough
experienced kids. It isn’t going to be a
matter that they don‘t know them well
enough, especially from last year."

The Little Dutch have a lot of key
players to watch. One of the biggest is
Austin Bonnema.

“Austin Bonnema isone ofourleadcrs
on both Sides of the ball," Schulte says.
“We also have tight end Tim
VandeNoord, quarterback KellyJenison
and tailback Dom Lovan, They have all
been strong players for us."

Bonnema puts up the big numbers for
Pella. As a fullback this season, he has
nIshed 72 times for 355 yards and six
touchdowns. As a defensive end,

Eonnema has 42 unassisted tackles, 31
assisted and three tackles for losses.
Another big defensive end for the Little
Dutch is Nick Sponsler.

“As for Bonnema, we have got to get
a man on him every time and make sure
he is blocked,” says Dunne. “They also
have reliedon the nuining game this year
more than they have in the past."

Thenuminggamealsoincludeslovan, .- '

who is currently ﬁﬁh In the district In
rustling. He earned 126 times for 661
yards this season.

“Something we haven t faced so far
this season is a quarterback who can run
thefobtball,“Dunnesays.“Kellernison
is very capable of doing that."

VandeNoord is the seventh leading
scorer in the district. In addition to the
fourtouchdowns he has tallied, 25 ofhis

points have been accounted for by his
foot. He accountstor IosuccesstulI’A I s

and three field goals.

Grinnell‘s own Brad Routier is the -

eighth leading scorer in the district, and
allofhispointshavecomefromkicking.
Routier has 37 PATs and three ﬁeld
goals.

Schulte says Pella has a tough game
whenitgoeshead—to»head\vithGrinnell.

“We're just going to have to play an
exceptional football game," he says.
“Which means no mistakes. Grinnell
excels in the special teams and will take
advantageofanymistakesthataremade,
It is going to be a really physical
ballgame."

xThe Tlgers have already clinched a
playoff berth, but Dunne wants Grinnell
to have sole ownership of the district
title.

“Obviously,thisisforthedistricttitle,"
he says. “We‘ve clincheda share, but We
want it all. The good things about the
upcoming game is number one, we play
on T.T. Cranny Field, and number two,
we will have good field conditions. The
guys have worked for this game since
NOV. 11, 1997."

This game is going to be a challenge,
according to Dunne.

“Pella isbiggerthan Chanton, which
will make it a physical ball game " he
says. ”I have heard every coach say that
theyneedtostopourbigplays,butweare
capable of limng it up, controlling the
ball andmoving it down the field. We are
not just a big play football team. We
certainly have the ability to make big
plays happcnbccause we have the speed
to do so,“

Going into this game, Justin Jansen
needs just one rushing touchdown to tie
the school record he set in 1997 with 21
mshing touchdowns. He is also close to
the Tiger record for season scoring in a
season.

Several individual school records for
Grinnell are close to being broken head»
ing into action with the Little Dutch.

Dunne encourages everyone to make
it out for the football game Friday at 7
pm.

“If you like athletics at all and like
football," he says. “You should be
there. I don't want to look up in the
stands and see any empty seats. This is
a classic matchup: it is Grinnell versus
Pclla."

Vigil will mark
Shepard slaying

Grinnell College student organizers
are inviting the general public to take
part in a candlelight Vigil service to
mourn the death of a young Arizona
man who died after being beaten and
robbed earlier this month. »

Matthew Shepard, who authorities
said was beaten malnlybecausehe was
gay, died five days aﬁer the Oct 7
assault.

Thevigll will begin at 7 p.m, Friday
in Hemck Chapel on Park St. Dani
Long, one of the student organizers of
the event, said candles will be pro.

‘vided, or participants may bring their

own.

Long noted that there were 25,000
hate crimes reported in the U.S. be-
tween 1992 and 1996.

“Add to that the problem that many
people don't feel safe enough to report
harassment or violence. and the realv
ity of hate crimes is probably much

.more Widespread than the statistics

suggest " she said.
