a ﬁrst place at a state meet This
fact alone makes the prospect lot-
a winning team iathcr doubtful.

The greatest losses sustained
by the team ate Snider, ill the
sprints, and Engclke in the pole
vault. both of whom were ﬁrst
place men.

In as much as there was no Fall
meet it is impossible, at this early
tlate to know who the promistng
men ztlL‘. or how much they can be
depended upon.

The prospects in llle jumps are
a little brighter than a year ago.
Several candidates have begun

all will take up the work with the
and determination as
these, we can look for only the

Basket Ball.

Today the inst iiitereclass basket
ball game is played and nothing
remains to interfere with organiz
mg a college team which will be
actedit to the college. There is
good material in School and what
is needed is cooperation and
practice No class rivalry should
now stand in the way. The man-
ager or the college team has been
ll’yilig to secure dates [or games
and negotiations are being made
for two games with S. U. 1.. one
game with Des Moines College,
one with Western College, and an.
other with the Des Moincs Y. M,
C. r\. some at these games will
probably take place very shortly

and we can't organize fora PBI'II‘la'
nent team too soon. Every class
has some likely candidates for the
‘varsity team and all should be out
to practice every practice night.

Brisket ball is something new in
Iowa college this being the ﬁrst
a year college team has been or-
ganized nndel the Athletic union.
We can only judge our prospects
by n hat we have done, In otlrganle
with the Y. M. C, A. team of Des
Monies the team showed very good
teamwork but were weak on tlirowe
