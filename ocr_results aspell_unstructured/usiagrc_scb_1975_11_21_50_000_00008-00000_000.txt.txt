Two years ago the Crinnell
basketball team suffered from
dissension and losing. Last year
the dissension disappeared but
there was still the losing. Maybe
this year that will disappear, too.

”I think we will be a contender
for a first division finish,” second-
year Head Coach Ron Mitchell
said. The top ﬁve teams in the
Midwest Conference make up the
first division.

There is at least one reason to
think the cagers ivill gain a spot in
the upper bracket. Last year, the
team had height disadvantage
against most oi their opponents.
This year's squad will allow
Grinnell to look down at opponents
instead of up,

But Mitchell is trying for more
than just height. “We will adjust
our type of play according to the
team we play,” he said.
“Sometimes we will be a pressing
team, sometimes a deliberate
team and sometimes a Zone team. I
think we will be best at controlling
the ball. as we did last year. I hope
we can take up where we left off
last year,"

Last year’s team, which finished
s-lo in conference play and 87H
overall, was led by Bill Bailey and
John llaigh. Badey graduated but
Haigli remains and he should be
the team’s top player. Named to a
iirst team altcontercnce spot at

conference sco‘ng, one point shy
of iirst. The wmner? Bailey.

Helping l-laigh in the front court
will be Joe Kingma, Bill Knox, and
Matt Miller, as Well as senior Jeff
Fallon Veteran Scott Lewis will
also help when he recovers irom an
injury. The center spot belongs
mostly to Gunnar Thors, who. at or

top rebounder. Veteran guards
Craig zippe, who was otten a key
player in last year’s contests, and
Roger Warner will be joined this
year by impressive lreshman
Charlie Gogel and Warner's
brother, Carl nob Eyre also
figures to get some playing time.

Mitchell said he is not yet certain
of the exact stariinglineup but said

Grid round-up

by ‘I‘om Ai-onbcrg

For Midwcst Conference football
teams, the practice season and
regular season are over, It is now
the hindsight season.

Grinnell’s sixth place finish with
a 3—5 record was below ex-
pectations. A .500 record or better
was what most people were hoping
for. Perhaps with a break or two
the other way . . .

“I was hoping for at least a 5-4
record,” Said Assistant Coach John
Martinek, “so I was very disap-
pointed With the loss to Knox.” He
added, “We’ve started to get rid of
the losing image that has built up
over the past iour, iive, or six
years, but we didn’t do it totally.
We're still making the transition."

But many people believe that the
season produced a lot oi good
results as well: We learned what
winning is,” said Assistant Coach

Ron Mitchell. who had predicted
that Grinncll would contend for the
conference championship, barring
injuri .

Assistant Coach Mo Hunt
commented, “I think this year we
moved back to respectability.
People will start to look up to
Gl'innell College now."

Grinnell won its first road game
ln loul‘ years this - season, but
playing away from home still
seems to be a disadvantage.

Besides winning on the road, the
Pioneers must prove that they can
beat the better teams in the con-
ference, Three of their wins came
against teams that finished below
Grinnell in the standings and the
other was over a weak Chicago
team. If they can do these two
things, they can, indeed, beat
anybody.

college division events. Notable
were the performances oi divers
Joe Wambach and Norm Zim-
merman, who in addition to Win-
ning the college one and three
meter diving sections also beat the
divers from the University of
Northern Iowaln both events On a
single competitor basis Zim-
merman distinguished himself by

taking second at one meter and, ,

third in the three meter event.

Coach Ray Obermillel‘ expressed
satisiactlon with the majority of
the team's performances. The
combination of Bruce Jones, Chris
Corton, Doug Johnson, and John
Chambers handily won the 400 yd.
iree relay to give Grinnell its tirst
win oi the meet Bert Simpson

which will consist oi la players tor
home games and ten for road
contests. Those who do not make
the varsity will play on the JV
team, which is coached by John
Hicksnl‘lershey, Mitchell said he
expects some players to alternate
between the varsity and JV
squads.

The Pioneers start their schedule
on Nov, 28 at Beloit and will play
most of the first half of the season
on the road, before finishing the
season mostly at home. Four of the
first live games are against con-
ference teams, so Mitchell
scheduled two ore-season
scrimmagcs, one olwliich is at 4:00
today in Darby Gym against
Central College, to keep the team
from entering the contests rusty.

Grinnell tied for sixth place last
year, with Coe and Knox the can
champions. The Kohawks and
Siwashcrs, along with the Ripon
Redmen‘, are expected to be the
toughest competitionin the con-
ference. Mitchell said, “Of the

Women outlook grim

by Rich Arnold

Coach Sandy Hoth has twelve
women scrambling around the
Island Gym those days as practice
for the women’s basketball team is
well into its third week. The turn
nout, while not as large as lnight
have been hoped for, is nonetheless
pleasant, tor enthusiasm is an
earmark of the squad. Said Hoth,
“The women are working hard,
putting out, and learning.”

Last year’s team never really
got off the ground so basically all
the women are iirst year players.
Revving up for the season are
seniors Sara Keene and Laurice
Valentine, juniors Mary Brandt,
Laura Burrows, Cathy Humy, and
Cathy Lee, sophomores Karen
Sesbeau and Chris Stldley, and
fresh-ones Angie Anderson, Minje
Martinez. Anne Owen, and Beth
Wiley. Lee and Stidlcy are the most
experienced players and appear to
be the squad’s most steady perr
formers,

Coach Hath did not express great
optimism when commenting on
hopes ior the season, She em-
phasized that the Pioneers will be
playing the bulk ot their games
against women who may have as
much as ten years experience.

Awards?

by Toni Arcnbcrg

The Midwest Conference ans
nounoed its all-conterence iootball
teams Monday and the selections
were highly criticized by the
Grinnell Pioneers. Many people
beliéve that some Pioneer players
should have been rated higher,

Pioneer receiver Paul Delaney
was the only Grinnellian named to
the first team. Runningback Tom
Goetz, defensive back Mike Harris.
and guard Dcnnis Walters were
chosen to the second team. The
selections are made by the con-
ference head coaches.

The controversy centers mostly
around the failure to name
defensive tackle Scott Fackrell to
either of the teams and around the
selections of Goetz and Harris to
the second squad rather than to the
first.

“I think the voting got political,"
Assistant Coach Mo Hunt said.
“Coaches Want to get their own
boys in, It's a popularity contest,”

Assistant Coach Ron Mitchell
said, “Coaches don‘t consider the
people who caused them problems

.ldon't know for a fact, but it's
my personal opinion that there is a
lot of soliciting . . . and I heard
Scott Fackrell lost a spot on the
second team by a coin flip!"

Fackrell seemed somewhat
unairected by the matter. “I'm
ﬂattered that I was considered,"
he said, “but it’s really not that

important.
