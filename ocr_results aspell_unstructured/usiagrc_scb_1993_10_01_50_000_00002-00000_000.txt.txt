Rosenfield Symposium Addresses
Technology and Democracy

By Riva Sharples

ECHNOLOGY. its affect on
I communication. and its abilr
ity to protect democracy was
the focus of this week's Rosenfield
Symposium The most crucial ele-
ment in this debate, according toconr
sulting firm specialist Dale Hatfield,
is the policy choices facing Ameri-
cans currently. Hatﬁeld addressed a
small crowd in the Forum Wednes-
day night.

“Technologyhasreallychanged
in the past few decades,” he said. “I
believe that technology can probably
protect democracy, but the acute
choices are facing us right now.“

There have been seven major
changes in technologyin thepast few
years, according to Hatfield.

“When I stand back and look at
technology, probably the biggest
change is the shift to computer lane
guageieverything is in numbers."

While pointing out technologir
cal changes, Hatfield was also quick
to note the problems in privacy and
secrecy created by them.

“We are compressing signals
now, which enables us to send more
through the airwaves. With fiber
optics moving closer to the home, we
have a tremendous capacity to trans-
mit information, Networks are be-
coming two way and are becoming
much more intelligent, I can dial
Pizza Hut on a phone in a phone
booth in some unknown city, and the
network will find out the caller‘s lo-
cation and then route the call to the
nearest Pizza Hut.

“But we have to be careful with
these policy issues, AS a society we
must ensure that a monopoly does
not happen, and we need to know
who is controlling the information
coming into our homes,"

One of Haificld's main concerns
was the bottleneck, which controls
things going into a viewers' home.

“if there’s a monopoly control
over a market, the person who con
trols the bottleneck can control what
comes into the house, and this is
dangerous for democracy.”

Thoughheis“disappointcd”with
PresidentClinton'srecentiy proposed
communicationsplan, Hatﬁeld isalso
hopeful that it can help regulate the
system,

“Clinton and Gore's plan is to
set up a national information infra
structure by promoting private in-
vestment and by extending the con-
ceptof universal servtce,among other
things. The problem is that the issue
it is a messy situation in the United
States. We’ve got 52 jurisdictions
and different views.”

will be making these decisions are

tive Branch.

Wilson Fellow Gives Convo

“Polling and the New Age Technology: Communicating with the

American Public,” for this week’s scholar‘s convocation. l-lart,
the 199394 Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow, discussed lhc current
stale of public opinion research and the prospecls for future develop—
menB.

Hart claimed that the nature of American politics has been greatly
changed by new communications technologies. He said that modern
polling data can be used to ﬁnd issues which will maximize voter support
of a candidate. After conducting a poll, a candidate can use marketing
techniques to identify himself with issues where there is widespread
agreement, and use similar techniques to identify his opponent with issues
which are divisive. Polling datacan be used todcvise theentirccampztign’s
strategy and suggest allocation of campaign funds for speciﬁc issues.

Hart related the massive cllanges which have occurred in polling by
describing the differences between polling when he started in the ﬁeld and
a recent poll his firm did. When Hart started polling in 1964, the method
was to draft a survey and mail it lo regional ofﬁces where interviewers
would collect the data by going door to door, The information would be
mailed back to lite central ofﬁce where it would be tabulated, entered on
punch cards, and analyzed using a rented computer. The entire process
could take 3-4 weeks. in contrast, Hart’s firm recently did a poll for NBC
on President Clinton’s Health Care Plan. One and a half hours after the
president’s speechtoajointsessionofCongressand thcnatiori. polling data
on 838 people had been collected, analyzed, and presented to NBC, Hart
also mentioned briefly a new type of polling technology being developed
which would allow moment bymomentopiniondata to becollected during
an event.

Hart concluded his remarksbydiscussinga wide mnging pollof young
people which he conducted for the MTV television network. He said that
this 16-29 year-old group was contemptuous of institutions. optimistic
about the future, and believes genelally thatsociety is falling apart economi-
