Kushubtt explains KDIC shutdown

To the Editor,

On Thursday November 19th, I
called a meeting of all the DIS and
staff in the Fonim to discuss many of
the last weeks events at KDIC and
since so few DJs showed up, I de-
cided that KDIC ought to be shut
down for the remainder of the semes-
terstardngafterThanksgiving recess.

I realize this will be a very un-
popular move, butI would like to take
some time to explain why I resorted
to this drastic action.

About two weeks ago, Student
Affairs hired anew engineer to check
the KDIC equipment. This new engi-
neer, who has worked with KGRN
and the station at William Penn col-
1ege,foundKDICinnumerous violar
tions of major FCC codes. Some of
these violations included not having
all DJ‘s licenses posted at the trans-
mitter siteandnot operating the'Emer—
gency Broadcast System. He further
discovered that KDIC was operating
with only a construction pemiit for a
100watttransmitter,anddidnothave
an actual license to operate at that
wattage. That latter violation was re-
solved when Grinnell’s lawyers were
called and contacted the FCC which
assured us we do have a license, it’s
just that someone stole it.

Additionally, tltis past week, I
found a note in the KDIC studio that
asked several very pointed questions
about my leadership capabilities as
station manager. “Why does it take 8
weeks to catalogue allof the summer
CDs'Z”,“Why are there nonew records
in the studio?” and ﬁnally, “Why do
we put up with this?“ were some, but
not all of the questions I was asked.
Therefore I called a meeting to ex-
plain myself.

Last year the staff got together

and tried to chart a new course for
KDIC that would make it a more
serious radio station. By the term
serious, it was meant that KDIC would
be more supportive of DJ s by getting
them new music quicker than ever
before, weekly reporting to the Col—
lege Music Journal to insure that we
are serviced by record companies,
and a reorganization of the staff to
accomplish this. This scmeSler,I tried
toimplementlhesechangesand found
thatchangingsomethingwithasmuch
complexity as a radio station takes a
lot of work. Trying to get the new
music to DJs was hard because our
new system was notfully operational
until about the 5th week of school.
And many of the changm weremeant
for Iongrten-n benefit, and not always
appreciable in the short-term. So on
Thursday I wanted to call a meeting
to tell the DJs about the goings on at
KDIC from the FCC violations to the
changes, and much to my dismay not
many Dls showed up. I sent out re—
peated computer messagesaskin g for
them to attend this mandatory meet;
ing, andyet the DJs atKDIC were not
responsible enough to attend. I felt
that this was the last straw; I had too
many other things to worry about
“behind the scenes" atKDIC to baby
sit Dis while they were on the air.
Maybe I am at fault because my
changes have not produced concrete
results immediately, but I thrnk that
this situation, Dls showing little re-
spect for KDIC, has been occurring
foralong time. Iwason stafflastyear
and noticed the same problems: DJ
apathy in regards to refiling records
in the studio and the stealing of CDs
which is not only rude and inconsid~
erate to other Dis, but niins KDIC's
responsibility to the campus commur

Art thefts frustrating

To theeditor:

In the past month. several stu-
dent art works have been stolen from
the Fine Arts Building: specifically,
two were pastel works in the painting
studio (one a mastercopy of a Monet),
and one was a print on display in the
first floor gallery space. Needless to
say, the art faculty and students are
very upset by this malicious disre-
gard for property.

As things currently stand, the
studios are unlocked for student ac
cess and the exhibition space is
unsupervised to allow greater avail-
ability to the campus in general. Ifthc
thefts continue, both these resources
will be restricted or eliminated. This
will be a loss for our artists who wish
to produce and exhibit an, and will
also be a loss for the community as a
whole if we lose the ability to exhibit
student works.

We would ask that if anyone
knows any details about the stolen
art, please report it to the Fine Arts
office. An original work of art is not
replaceable and represents a huge in

vestrnent of time, creative energy,
and thought by the artist. Please help
us preserve the open atmosphere we
presently enjoy and respect our
Grinnellian artists.

Getting personal:
talk to Wushlturn

To the editor,

lnvariably, every semester, the
issue of Mike Washbum‘s alleged
racism becomes an ongoing point
of contention among S &B writers.
After three years of this nonsense
(four for seniors), I feel it’s getting
a little old. Instead of calling
Washbum a racist or insinuating
that he is one, those who wonder
should spare a little of their pre-
cious time to talk with him in per
son, and decide for themselves.

interesting music and programming.

Therefore my staffand I plan to
work diligently for the rest of the
semesterwhileKDICisdowntowrite
a DJ and staff manual and to get
KDIC legal in regard to FCC rules. I
would like to apologize to those of
you who are DJs and do take your
responsibility to KDIC seriously and
havetosuffer. To youlaskyou to re-
apply next semester when KDIC will
be FCC legal and as well organized
and efficiently run as I can possibly
make it,

Tree
Vandalism

To the editor:

This year there has been amarked
decline in the drunken vandalism of
college property, and for this we are
ever so grateful. Unfortunately, the
latest trend in the venting ofdrunken
aggression is killing newly planted
helpless young trees.

Earlier this fall voyagers retuma
ing from the bar stumbled upon two
oftlteyoung “rcdmond"lindensztlong
6th Avenue, and snapped them in
two. (Snapping trees in two does kill
them.) If they had been allowed to
grow, each of these trees would have
been 70 feet tall Willi 50 footspreads.

Continuing their drunken joura
ney home, our friends then stopped
off at the Peace Grove in front of the
library and snapped off a third of a
carnelian cherry dogwood; it would
have bloomed yellow in the Spring
time. They then moved on to the
Science building, where they snapped
an American chestnut in two.

And on the third weekend of
November a“patmore" green ash from
thatsameethAvenuccurvewaspulled
up and found the followrng Monday
in the loggia in front of Rawson.

What can EM. do? Not plant
any trees between State Street and
North Campus?

If the loss of beautrful trees to
present and future Grinnelltans does
nothing to quell your destructive ten-
dencies, please consider the man and
woman power invested in the sclecr
tion, purchase, planting, and care of
those trees, Or perhaps you should
consider the $200 price tag per tree.

boycott of

To the editor:

With the passage of Amend-
tnent2, the rights and well being of
bisexuals, lesbians, and gay men
are no longer protected by law in
Colorado. Amendment 2 notonly
repeals previous anti-discriminaA
tion laws; it also prohibits enact-
mentoflaws on the local level that
ban discrimination on the basis of
sexual preference. To me, this
means I am no longer welcome in
Colorado.

In reaction, a national boycott
targetsColoiado'stourismandcon-
vention trade. This is reminsentof
the Arizonaboycottthateffectively
persuaded the Arizona Congrms to
establish a state holiday in honorof
theCivilRights activist,Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. The Colorado
Amendment isanother case of civil
rights, thistime forgay Americans,
our friends, families, and commu-
nities.

We must speak out and act “1
unity. Our slogans must be “Ski
Wisconsin," “Ski Vermont," and
“Ski Kansas.” We must encourage
the businesses we patronize, work
forand own to refrain from holding
conventions in Colorado. “Look-
ing for a place for your next cone
vention? Try anywhereBUT Colo-
rado." If you are heading West by
car, gas up and get food before you
hit the state line and stop only as

frequently asisneeessary for safety.

Thcse affumative actions are
only part of the process, however.
We must let Colorado know our
actions arcintcnuonal. Dropaquick
note to the Colorado Tourism Bu-
reau telling them of our boycott.
Call them on their toll-free number
(1-800-265—6723). Encourageothr
ers to do so as well. Before last
November’s election, these were
drfficulttimcsto ﬁghtanti-gay senr
timentand legislation. Weare now
in the wake of election returns that
affirm differences in sexual prefer-
ence. Thepresidentrelectpublically
disagrees with the ban of gay men
and lesbians from the armed ser-
vices. (This law may silence us
while we are in the military, but it
doesn’t keep us out.) An anti-gay
bill in Oregon fell in defeat, We
must continue this positive, for-
ward momentum.

Gay, straight, and bisexual
Americansare makingadifference,
Colorado is noton ourlistofplaces
to vrsit anymore. It’s off our list of
places to live, to work, and tospend
any money. Ifthe people of Color

basis of sexual preference, they are
not isolating and endangering us,
just themselves.

We who beleive in freedom
cannot rest.

letters on shoplifters

To the editor:

Don’t shoplift from the book-
store. (A) It's too easy, so it's no real
challenge » every time I go to the
bookstore, I see people sneaking big
huge candybars into their backpacks,
pocketing tapes, disks, books, and
some really unlikely large items out
of the store. Maybe the bookstore
employeesareinstructedtojustglancc
the other way, or maybe they are
trained to pay absolutely no attention
to the store and to devote notevcn the
slightest amount of belief towards
even tltc remote possibility that shop-
lifting might be rcttl, for whatever
reason, but it secrrts lhttt tl would he
hard to avoid noticing a bit r H u
tween inventory and actual tier l

department is secretly running the
bookstore in order to run along tor-m

something. (B) I could uridersmnd if
you really needed the item but had no

mean, I typically see people stealing
unnecessary luxury items, such as a
big Nestle Crunch bar ,
Mmmmmmmrn. Ifyou are that hun-
gry, you could always try an entree at
Cowles as a last resort, even though I
would be the first to admit that the
Nestle Crunch bar sounds thousands
of times more appealing.
