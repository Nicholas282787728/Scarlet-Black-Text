The mid-year
switch to Turner

The selection of a new president is not any easy task. There
are no hard and last guidelines to follow beyond the impossible
iob of finding the perfect replacement tor a erhour iob. All of
the trustees, faculty, and students on the search committee
are to be congratulated for their thorough and exhausting
work over the past five months, After scanning thousands of
resumes and holding countless interviews, the committee has
selected Dr. A. Richard Turner as Grinneil College’s ninth

president.

Despite the rather sudden announcement, we feel that the
decision to install Dr. Turner this January permits the College
to pursue active policy decisions rather than undergoing a
prolonged lamerduck period. Any transition is difficult, but Dr.
Turner will have the advantage oi watching the college
operate while filled with faculty and students rather than
guessing about the true nature oi the school over the empty
summer months. The semester experience will prepare him
for his first academic year as president far better than any
reports and committee meeting minutes.

The College has grown admirably under Glenn Leggett’s
guiding hand. The decade he has so successfully presided over
ranks as one of the most difficul‘ in 'he history of violen‘
campus unrest, not to mention financial problems. Yet the
same period has yielded the most iarrreaching gains for
students in academic, social, and polilical rights.

We urge Dr, Turner lo Continue ‘he constructive liberal
reforms initiated during the Leggell administration,

The challenge, then, is open to both lhe campus and Dr.
Turner to forge a new and crea'ive administration.

 

Dear Mr. Turner,

We Wish to congratulate you
upon your selection as president oi
Gi-inncll College in the next
several years, Grinnell will be
laced with many serious problems
and we trust that your energy.
enthusiasm. and wisdom will
succcssiully guide the community.

We are looking iorward to working
With you next semester and hope
that we can lacilitatc your ad-
justment to Grinnell.
Congratulations again,

Join A Hansen
