campus news

oFormer SENATOR JOHN CULVER (D-IA) spoke in the Forum
Wednesday as part of a symposium on former U5. vice president
Henry Wallace. Culver, who co-authored a biography of the Iowa
native and leitswing politician, praised Wallace's personal and
political character. Other events in the program included a play
baSEd on Wallace's life and a pair of panels on his contributions
to agriculture and progressive politics . . . 0Construction of the
new EAST CAMPUS DORMS continues. The ﬁrst three of ﬁve
proposed and four planned dorms will be open for occupancy next
fall . . .eracilities Management employee Sue Posekany used
soap, water, and about fifteen minutes of her day to SCRUB PASTE
FROM A FILLAR outside Vounker Hall last week. The paste, made
of flour and water, had been used by members of the Radical
Students Collective to post politicallyrthemed signs. RSC members
have complained in the past that their posters are frequently
torn down. Posketany said she didn't mind spending a little time
outside, but that such oddjobs reduced the amount of time she
could spend maintaining residence halls.

ConﬂicB between a campus nondescrimination policy and a student
group’s religious values have divided the CENTRAL COLLEGE
community, in nearby Pella, IA, in recent weeks. When Brad Clark,
a student who helped plan worship services for the college’s
INTERVARSITV CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP, announced that he was
gay, the organization asked him to step down from his leadership
position in the group. Clark, who also happens to lie president of
Central: student government, has argued that the IVCF should
therefore be stripped of ofﬁcial student group status at the small
Christian college, which forbids groups from descrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation. Central's student government

rejected Clark's argument several weeks ago, and administrators
have not yet acted.

A discussion of campus alcohol policy at last week’s Joint Board
took an unexpectedly divisive turn when President Alejandro
Oyarzabal ’04 asked that a piece of information shared in the
meeting be STRUCK FROM IHE BODV'S MINUTES. When a
resolution on possible changes to campus alcohol policy mentioned
that administrators were considering easing keg restrictions and
lengthening possible hours for Harris parties, Oyarzabal said that
administrators had asked him not to publicize the first possibility,
and that he didn't want the second possibility to be misinterpreted
as a mandatory extension of party hours. After a number ofsenalors
objected to his request, Oyarzabal lamented and the discussion
was recorded . . . The resolution, to be passed or rejected by next
Monday/S JE, calls for SGA to fund the provision of "substantial

corrections

An article in last week's issue of the 5&5, "Bob’s continues to
lose money,” incorrectly reported that administrators had
recommended several speciﬁc methods of cutting costs at the
coffeeshop. Though Student Affairs did restrict Bob's to a limited
budget, the speciﬁc money-saving methods originated from Bob’s
staffers . . . A note in last week’s ”shorthand” incorrectly reported
that senators had "overwhelmingly approved" several proposed
changes to the SGA constitution. Though the body did
overwhelmingly approve bylaw changes loosening guidelines on
the frequency of hall councils, the would-be constitutional reforms
were merely presented to the body last week.
