Council Considers
Department Sizes,

Hiring Procedures

The Executive Councilcon-
tinued its discussion of facc
ulty size and discussed the
recommendations of Dr. Ran»
dall Morgan in two meetings
this week. In addition, the
Council set forth new guider
lines about publicising its ac-
tivities.
Morgan Recommendations

Meeting informally over
lunch with Morgan Saturday,
the Council heard several re~
commendations, including a
suggestion that a Committee
be established to act as a
clearing house for Black ap-
plicants for Facultypositions.
In a formal Special Meeting
immediately followingthe lune
cheon, the Council continued
its previous deliberations
about Faculty size and dis
tribution. It also approved
die following motion: "Moved
by Dean Wall, seconded by
Mr. Kurtz, that Dean Wall
publish to the general college
community the main items on
the agenda of the Executive
Council but that no further
information be released une
til abridged minutes are pub-
lished to the faculty."

Week’s Delay

Basically, this ruling means
that the agenda of each Wed-
nesday meeting will be in the
preceeding day’s Campus
Memo and that abridged min
utes of the meetings will be
available to the faculty and
campus press after a week's
delay.

Eoculty Size

; The issues of Faculty Size
and Distribution and of ad-
ditional Black faculty are ex
pected to occupy the Counr
cil meetings for severalmore
weeks to come. Dean Wall
said that no further speci'
fic information on these maI’
ters could be released at this
time.

In other action Wednesday,
the Council approved the es*
tablishment ofa Committeeto
oversee the awarding ofhono-
rary degrees by the college.
Details on this will be re
leased at a later date.

East Street Gallery Stuffings Allowed

Early this week, Terry Clif-
ford was denied permission to
stuff student mailboxes with
notices of a photographic ex
hibit at the East Street Gal-
lery in Grinnell.

College Business Manager
Ralph Pomerenk told the 5&8
that upon the Gallery’s pret
sentation ofa statement to the
college that the Gallery is
nontprofit, he would reconsi-
der the request for permission
to place literature in mailt
boxes.

Both Pomerenk and Dean of
Administration Waldo Walker
stated that commercial insti’
tutions are not allowed to
place advertising pieces in the
student boxes.

The East Street Callery sub
mitted a statement to Pome-
renk Thursday explaining that

the photo studio is a service,
non-profit operation separate
from the Gallery‘s manufac-
turing of photo products.

Thursday Pomerenk apt

proved the gallery's request
to place a photographic exhi-
bit in campus mailboxes.

On Thursday, September 9th,

ganizcd by Terry Clifford for

dents office, the meeting cent
tered principly on thejoysand
trials of these types of off
campus living.

The comments made at the
mecting wcrc generally en—
thusiastic. Students found
house living a bit busier but
also more comfortable, and
it supported a sense of cumt
munity not found in the dorms.

Coops are no more isolated
than people on the hall floors,

ses Seen Successful

and the spirit is better.
Though coeop members do
not undergo the wonders ofa
Saga meal and the chance to
meet students in the stimula-
ting atmosphere of the college '
dining halls, it was generally
conceded that their meals
were much better and more
comfortable. One comment
made was,"We’re eatingvery,
very well."

An important aspect of the
meeting was the resolve on
the part of the students to
expose more students to co-op
life through dinner visits.This
will not onlyallow many fresh-
men to see and come into con~
tact with the co- ops, but it
will also aid on evaluating the
entire system of co- op living.
