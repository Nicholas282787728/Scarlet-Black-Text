‘ Scarlet 6‘: Black - Friday, Apr/I24

An Appeal

I remember writing a column, for
the SSLB, my first year that pretty
much argued that the English depart-
ment did not include enough classes
focusing on the “Other", that is
people who are not white. All ofa
sudden English majors and Profes—
sors alike began to seek me out to
tell me just how wrong I was about
the department and that it strove to—
wards incorporating “multicultural"
literature. One student even implied
that, since I was an inexperienced
first year student, I wasjumping to
conclusions and as I got older and
wiser I would see the error of my
ways. So I became an English ma-
jor and after three years in the En-
glish department I have not changed
my mind. The English department
sucks even more than I originally
thought.

I must tell you from the outset that
this discussion is not about a personal
gripe that I have against the English
department. I am relating what hap-
pened to me because I feel it affects
all the students who endeavor to take
English classes at Grinncll College.
30, in the tradition of David Walker,
I am issuing an appeal to all English
majors.

After being an English major for
three years, last year I was suddenly
faced with the possibility of not
graduating at all. During registration
last year I found out that one of the
seminars I had already completed
would not count towards graduation.
The whole thing stemmed from the
fact thatI had taken the seminar, Af-
rican and Other Literatures in En-
glish, twice when it was not a class
that could be repeated for credit. I
knew this before I took the second
seminar and so did the professor who
taught the class. The professor then
told me that I would not be allowed
to take the second class unless I got
permission from various sources,
which should not have been a prob-
lem since the topic of the first senti-
nar was Contemporary South Afri-
can Lit. and the second African, Car-
ibbean . and African American

n Writers. So along with my”

advisor I got permission from the
English department head (which was
later denied and revoked) before I
pie-registered for the class. Had I
not gotten permission, I would cer-
tainly not have taken the Class.

So I go into Ed Moore‘s ofﬁce to
preregister because my advisor was
on sabbatical, and he tells me that this
class would not count towards the
completion of my major. He went
on to explain that the two classes
were too similar to constitute dif-
ferent seminars and that I should
have perhaps taken a poetry seminar
or other various classes to fulfill my
seminar requirement. When he told

me this I couldn’t quite believe that
what he was telling me was true. I
had gotten PERMISSION to do this.
but unfortunately neither me nor my
advisor thought to get anything in
writing stating that I had gotten per-
mission to retake ENG 360 for credit.
That was my mistake and Imost cerr
tainly paid for it.

The one thing I kept thinking about
after I left Professor Moore‘s ofﬁce
was this issue of the classes being
too similar to constitute different
seminars. What did he mean, ex-
actly, by “too similar"? After not
being offered a more coherent justie
fication from the English Depart-
ment, I was left to draw my own con-
clusions. (This struck me as being
severely disrespectful and discoune—
ous. I think that after being an Erie
glish major for three years the least
they could've done is offer me more
of an explanation than “they’re [the
two seminars] too similar.") The
more I thought about it, the more I
was convinced that it was a racist
statement. I want to make clear that
I am not labeling Professor Moore a
racist. What I am concerned with,
however, is how these two seminars,
that are clearly (or maybe not so
clearly) dealing with different sub-
ject matter, have come to be thought
of as “too similar". I don‘t want this
to degenerate into name calling or
questions about registration proce-
dures. What I am really interested in
is how literature by “the Other" has
been essentialized.

Let's take this word “similar".
What does that mean"! Itis the policy
of the English department to ericour»
age students to take many diverse
seminars. Completing two poetry
seminars is even discouraged. This
is an understandable policy. It is in
the best interest of all English ma-
jors to have as diverse a backgr'ound
in literature as possible. My concern
is how the two seminars I completed
were considered similar at all. The
works read for the two classes were
from different continents and they
were all written in English (as op~
posed to whatever other language the
author might speak) so the question
of the literature not being written in
English is null. Many other Grinnell
College English majors take all their
seminars in prose (rather than min
ing in a poetry seminar) so it could
not have been a question of the style
or type of literature because if that
were the case a lot of English ma-
jors would be in serious trouble. So
does similar mean that they were all
written by people of African descent?
Does all world literature, excluding
white American and English litera-
ture, have similar themes? This is
what] took this statement to mean

By Tequia Burr ' Opinion Editor

because I couldn‘t ﬁgure out what
else it could have meant. Black lit»
craturc is often politicized inside and
outside ofthe classroom all over the
United States. White literature is not
so often politicized and usually
talked about in terms ofacslhetrcs. I
most deﬁnitely do not have a prob-

lem With the works of black authors ,

being talked about in terms of col-
lective oppression experienced.
What I do have a problem with is
dismissing this literature because it
is too political and therefore not great
work aesthetically. Within this lies
the assumption that white literature
is apolitical and does not deal with
racial issues. This is a bunch ofcrzlp.
Toni Morrison in Playing in the Dark
makes a good point when she ana»
lyzes White literature in terms of its
colonial ideals. Why should we be
so presumptuous as to say race did
not matter to these Great Dead White
Men when they were so obsessed
with writing about the inferiority of
the Negro? If people were taught
Matthew Arnold‘s Culture and Ana
archy in terms of its contribution to
colonialist ideals and to the forma
tion of how race is articulated even
today, much would be learned about
the nature of oppression against
peoples of color.

If this is the case, that “similar" was
actually a code word for “all black
literature deals with similar issues",
why has black literature come to be
thought of as being the same and why
are Shakespeare and Milton not con—
sidered the same'.7 The two seminars
Itook were, actually, very different.
In fact, the authors were, if not from
different countries, from different
continents. What are the implica
tions of saying that black lifestyles
and art forms are similar even when
they are from drastically different
places, and when this similarity is
only based on their phenotypic ap-
pearance? Just ask yourself if the
English department would give
credit for both a Dostoevsky semi-
nar and Percy Shelley seminar com-

pleted (two European authors from, ,

different countries writing roughly
around the same time period). Would
they be labeled too similar? Ask
yourself why Eng 360: African and
Other Literatures in English cannot
be repeated for credit. Ask yourself
why such a vast amount of literature
from such a variety of different
places around the world only ware
rants a single seminar. This is some-
thing that you should not accept. You
say you want to validate and learn
about the experience of people of
color. Well, prove it. Insist that this
practice of marginalizing the litera-
ture of the Other is unacceptable.
You have more power than you think.

Strappin’ on the Feed Bag

BY ERIN PETERSON&
REBECCA EEERS
Food Critics

This week, we boldly went where
no Grinnellian has gone before, ex-
cept for graduates who work there.
We went to the Maid Rite.

As the hard»nosed journalists often
known as “food critics," we thought
it our duty to explore the places no
one dares enter. The Mayde Reight,
enigmatic as it was, seemed to be the
perfect choice for an expose. Like a
black hole. we had heard of no one
who had returned from its depths.

Although Rebecca informed Erin
that the Maid Write was a restaurant,
Erin stubbornly brought her basket
of dirty laundry in anyway. “I
thought it was a laundromat!" she
said indignantly. “Like many
laundromats, it has a roof! And also
walls! How was I supposed to
know?" Rebecca admitted that had
she been illiterate, she would have
made the same mistake.

As we discovered, the Made Rite,
in addition to being a restaurant, is a
sandwich made of meat that is de-
scribed as “loose." Much like
change, bowels, or Rebecca.

Grabbing the cash register, Rebecca
proceeded to hit Erin, the big fat
potty mouth, over the head with it.
Needless to say, Erin was knocked
unconscious. The employees were

dismayed, but took our order none-
theless.

Since Dave was watching his girl—
ish figure, he got a Cheese Rite,
which was loose,meat with a bonus.
It had mustard! Dave also asked if
he could get cheese with it, but it was
20 cents extra.

Just as we were being served,
whom did ouren eyes beholdeneth
next to our Round Table but the noble
SIR CHARLIE DUKE AND SIR
JIM SWAR'I'L. the esteemed leaders
of our college! Mouths agape, the
loose meat in our mouths spilled to
the ﬂoor. “Alas, ‘tis Paradise Lost,"
lamented Erin. Fortunately, since all
Maide Rites are served with spoons,
she had the opportunity to retrieve
the fallen loose meat. “Ahh, Paradise
Regained.” Erin said with a smile.
Charlie and Jim, who watched the
entire scene in horror, ﬂed. And they
took the presidential candidate with
them.

Though we were disappointed that
the celebrity guests had left, we still
had the Macho Nacho to add that
special something to our lunch ex
perience. Rebecca declared that she
was by far the most macho of the
lunch bunch, and, with cash register
in hand, proceeded to take the plate.
Erin demurrcd, screeching, “The
Meek shall inherit the earth, but
maybe not the Macho Nacho!"
Rebecca stared blankl at Erin, and

proceeded to eat a chip. “Wow, these
are the best darn nachos I‘ve EVER
eaten at the Mayed Rite. And that’s
a fact," she said, taunting Erin.

Erin maturely did not beat up
Rebecca, but this is only because she
has the strength of a melted stick of
butter.

While Erin couldn‘t have the Mile
cho Nachos, Dave highly recome
mended the tender loin to her. Erin
was disgusted, until she realized he
was talking about a sandwich. Dave
and Rebecca told many crude tender-
loin jokes, while Erin held her ears
and hummed Snoop Doggy Dog.

The strawberry shake. which had
the color, consistency, and effective
ness of Pepto Bismol. proved to be a
favorite after we had consumed our
weight in grease, much like hum-
mingbirds. Although hummingbirds
don‘t eat grease. Or Strawberry
Pepto Bismol. We thought it was an
apt metaphor at the time, though.

Overall, we were pleasantly sure
prised. We entered the restaurant ap-
prehensive, expecting loud, raucous
townies who wore overalls and ill-
ﬁtting baseball caps. However, we
left the Maid Rite having learned an
important lesson: eating food makes
us less hungry, yet sick. The only
thing that could have made this meal
better would be if they had served

Campus Cynic

Grinncll spends a lot of money try-
ing to decrde why it is not the most
desirable school in the nation, wante
ing to know why it’s attracting stu-
dents who would rather have lastin g
and meaningful friendships than
$80,000 a year jobs post - graduae
tion. I’ve heard they want to disc
mantle my department, American
Studies, and begin others, including
Business. They have a report out
basically stating that the students are
not of the quality other similar col-

leges attract. Grinnell has a complex.-

I think it stems from the fact that ale
most all of us have been met with
such responses as “Oh, Cornell is so
nice. How do you like upstate New
York?" and “Is the suicide rate there
still Very high?" Grinncll College
wants to be in the Ivy League, not
just confused With a similar-sound-
ing university. Maybe it‘s the money
that‘s causing such conservatism,
maybe those in charge like the first
years still taking showers and dress
ing from J. Crew at end of the year
and want more pretty preppy docile
types, maybe they're sick of clean—
ing up spilled bong water and bro—
ken whiskey bottles, maybe they‘re
in some sort of bet with Carleton; I
don’t know.

But I can tell theln why their plan,
regardless of what they will do, will
never work. While writing this,l_hgd

are caused by large amounts of pole
lcn, found only in highly isolated and
rural environments. Duh. I'm aller—
gic to Iowa. So are a lot of people,
whether literally or psychologically.
And no amount of Allegra, Ritalin,
or Prozac will change where we live.
Regardless of how much tnoney
Grinnell spends on marketing and
promotion in the next few years,
none ofus will be able to geta falafel
sandwhlch with an iccd mocha on the
way to class. There will be no Come
edy Central on our cable system . no
SouthPark, no Dr. Katz, no reruns of
The Kids in The Hall, no Daily Show.
There will be no Pop Up Video or
even Fashion File. Wc’ll still have
to drive to Iowa City or Des Moines
or Chicago for decent produce, come
pact disks, and/or eye candy. We
will, though, be able to encounter
pseudoefrat boys and their girlfriends
as we walk (hungry and non
caffinatcd) towards ARI-l. Maybe,
ifwe’re really lucky, that debate over
who throws 2| better party- Greeks or
Offcampus Dwellerse will exist out-
side of Lmk Magazine and on our
very own campus:

The most ironic thing about
Grinncll’s new plan of action is that
they want the students to be more
career-focused, though they barely
support student internships. If
Grinncll really wanted us all to do
well and have shiny resumes, every
one would get a grant for the sums
mer to work at some nice company
or public interest group.
Unfortunatly, this is not the case.
Unfortunately, there was an tncredr
ible number of people applying for a
handful of summer grants. The
school will have a billion dollars by
the end of the fiscal year and many
ofus will still have to temp this sum-
mer, despite fabulous internship of-
fers. People who want internshps for
the semester must go through im-
mense amounts of red tape and are
denied for superficial and/or un-
named reasons. (Unless you're a
pretty, preppy, docile type. Then you

They won't let you go off—campus
the ﬁrst semester of your senior year,
despite the fact that you are apply-
ing for a program that would not only
compliment your major (which you
are in the process of finishng as a
junior) but also your future career all
because you got bad grades your
freshman year even though you did
well beyond the requirements for off-
campus study last fall. In fact, you
got the best grades you’ve had since
sophomore year in high school. And
then they deny you the editorship of
The GUM for your senior year be
cause you are too controversial (read:
too funny). God forbid, a year ofthe
Grinncll humor magazine that is acv
tually funny. And you want to be a
writer when you grow up. Too bad
you offended SPARC. Too bad you
weren‘t a member ofSPARC; maybe
then you could have been editor be-
cause that’s how it works around
here. Nepotism , we live the defini-
tion. You were even offered a posi—
tion in SPARC but you had to tum it
down because they meet at the same
time as Party ofFl've . Maybe they’ll
let you be campus cynic next year.
Yippee. One hundred and fifty dole
lars a semester to hear people tell you
how you aren‘t nearly as much of a
bitch in real life.

Oh yeah, and to prospectives: If
you haven‘t gathered already, most
ofwhat you see is a myth. The ﬂow-
ers outside of Burling Library were
probably planted the day before you
got there. The smiling, frisbeevplaye
ing, laughing, happy people are prob-
ably stoned or drunk or both. Un-
less they’re prospectives just like
you. Or they dropped out. Or were
kicked out. Or about to do both.
Your tour guide will probably steer
you away from those who are cry-
ing, rocking back and forth, mutter-
ing things like “I can’t take it any-
more" or “I‘m having a breakdown"
or “Why did I ever go here?" It ex—
ists. It all exists. And if you come
here you'll contribute to it. '
