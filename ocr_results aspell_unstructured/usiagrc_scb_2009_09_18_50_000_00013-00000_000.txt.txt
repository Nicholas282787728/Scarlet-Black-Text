Athletic Bible Study

BY LlANA EISMJiN

When faced with a heavy workload and the
demands ofcxtracnmcrilar activities, students turn
to various resources in order to cope with dress
burdens. While some look to recreational activiv
ties and others seek out counseling, two athletes
at Grinnell College have found both spiritual en—
richment and a silpportlv: community in the form

or the Grinnell College
Christian Athlete's Fellow

51“,, ”It helps me get a peace of mind.
To get away from the stud-
ies for a bit, it just relaxes me
There are some things that
athletes have to deal with that
non-athletes don’t. "

A relatively new orgrr
nization on campus, the
Grinnell College Christian
Athletes Fellowship was
founded by Gregory Suryrr
’11 and Enoch Corrinrey'iz
with the hopes of providing
2i tlghrdmlr community in
which studelltrathlctes can
participate in Bible studies
and the practical application otreligious texts while
simultaneously connecting with their athletically
rnindod peers on a deeper level.

“Last year, we smrted talking aboirt doing an
adilctcs' Bible study because there weren’t really
many athletes going to community worship or to
the Bible studies held by the Grinnell College
Christian Fellowship,"Sutyn sald.“We got togethe
er and decided that we wanted to bridge that gap
between athletics and the Christian community."

After reeling “shy” and “singulu” during his
tirst tew years, sirryn tornrerl the group to counter
Christian athletes together.

“th ultimate god is to create a community
and bring all orrlrese athletes together so th2rt we
arenr really alone and can support each other in
both our athletic events and our academic studies,"
Suryn said “eVV earc concerned about answering
questions that [athletes] mighr have and applying
this to our athletic life here."

An extension of the Grinncll College Chris~
tian Fellowship, the Grinnell College Clil' ian
Athlete‘s Fellowship provides an outlet fol religious

snidy in an environment that is inclusive, casual
and open to debate and discussionThe structure
of the weekly Bible study meetings, which occur
on Thursdays in the PEC, give way to a collabe
oraiive learning experience, in which ideas can bc
voiced, shared and quesriorred.

“Instead of Enoch and I standing there and
preaching what the passage means, we go through
and note observations and
questions," Surya said.
“After that we go through
it again and discuss it as ii
group. At the end we have
an application. Like ‘Olg
so we have read all of dais,
now how can we apply it?”

More than just a re-
ligious study group, the
Grinnell College Chris
tian Athlete's Fellowship
prides itself on their com,
munity in which student athletes can connect with
one another and seek our support.

“I can relate and communicate with those who
attend Bible studies who I formally did not know
at all," Commey said. “If it wasn’t for Bible study
I don't think that I would have met them in the
ﬁrst place,"

With several studcntearhlctcs and the Men's
and Women's Tennis Coach Andy Hamilton at-
rendrng the weekly Bible studies, the Grinncll
College Chrisnan Athlete's Fellowship has al-
ready establishcd a foundation for themselves. It’s
a srnall group ofabout seven ro eighr snidenrs rhar
attend meetings, brrr as the year progresses rlrcy
hope to continue 'ng support from Gr-inncll
athletes, regardless or their spiritual orientation

“it helps mt: get a peace of mind," said Cody
Weber ‘13, a linebacker for the Pioneers’ football
rerrn, “To get away from the studies for rr little bir,
itjusr relaxes me. There are some things that ath-
lctcs havc to do deal with that nonrathletes don't,
rlrere‘s a certain pressure to coinpctc and to do well
and at the same time do well in school."

strong passing game, Berger, the Rniglrrs'quarter-

passed against Warrburg, as Grinnell held him to
66 total yards passing.

“The secondary defense played great, it's a
group ofl'cally experienced guys—we have three se-
niors and a junior starting on secondi ,"defensive
back Banohnson’lo said."But it was awhole team

In the trenches, MVVC Defensive Player of the
week Ryan Fletcher ‘11 dchvcred an outstanding

forcin a fumble. A sack by Fletcher in the third
quart , with St Norbert leading 14 3, giving the
Pioneers a chance with the bi.ill brought a turning
point to the game

Hamilton has advised Fellowship of Christian
Athletes for two decades before this group was
formed.

“Tire student leaders are doing aworlderﬁdjoh
of leading their classmates," Hamilton said. “It's
been run for irie to sit and listen and to participate.
But] think that it's easier to connect in a spiritual
situation when you're connecting with peers and so
the student led put is important."

I-Iiiniiltoli who sees himself as a lcsourcc and
a mentor to the strident leaders and members,
emphasizes the impomuicc of a “sound spirit” in
athletics.

“The Greek philosophers talked about a sound
bodv. sound mind and sound spirit," Hamilton
said “I think often times the sound spirit gets lost
and at least for we personally having 2r sound spirit

RolilsRT LOGAN

is an important part of my makeup and so ifthey
are students that want to biplore that part of the
triangle that’s what a Bible study group or any
other spirlnirrl group can do for them."

Coruruey stresses that this group is for airy—
body eaploring what a sound spirit rneans

”There is no criteria, you dont have to be a
Christian to attend,” Commey said We dont
want someone to feel left out. It is more like a
fellowship where we are all learning. Tlierc rs no
leader. we are all learning together,"

Christian Athlete’s Fellowship values community

“No mi“! N his or hcr own island." Commcy
said. “You need pcople in order to survive and that
is where the fellowship cornes into play."
