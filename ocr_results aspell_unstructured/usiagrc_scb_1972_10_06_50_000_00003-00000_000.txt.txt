Music Makes The Man

by Elaine Carey

“Very, very serious business.”
That is the meaning of the music
to the man, Cecil Lytle.

Lytle, a professor of applied piano
and Jazz improvisation, yiews his
music with an urgency because muA
sic as an oral tradition is an in-
terpreter oi culture and to him this
means his role is one oianinter-
preter, a poet, an orator, and a
messenger of the black culture. Lyn
tie expressed that, at the beginning
of his career his approach to his
music was youthful and iun, but
now it is a sense oi cultural urgenr
cy that motivates him.

Originally irom New York city,
Lytle received his tirst musical
training at approximately age live
from his father, who was a church
organist. Oberlin, the University of
Wisconsin, and the University oi
New York gave him his formal
musical training. Alter school,
Lytle played proiessionally at con-
certs across the country.

His appearance on the Grinnell
campus in October ”71 led to the
oilering and acceptance oia teach-
ing position here. Regarding Lytle's
feelings about the campus, he com—
mented. "I have positive feelings;
I don't have a bad taste in my mouth
yet, ldon't expect to." He believed
his wiie and Six year old son would
be in agreement with him also, al-
though Grinnell was a change from
the big city. He characterized his
students as sincere, "I dig working
with sincere people. ldemand sin-

cerity so i don't waste my time or
theirs.“ In relation to the black
community on campus, Lytle cited
them as “a very sincere group oi
young people who are aware oi who
they are now and later on H

The Black Cultural Weekend, Lytle
stated, was a “deiinite success,”
“the message was delivered and
taken well.“ Anyone who missed
it, he added, missed something rare,
especially Sunday night. The per-
iormances oi Reggie Workman,
Mtume, Charles Tolliver, Tony
Callender, and Charles Davis made
the evening “rare" according to
Lytle who referred to these perr
formers as “the elite corp, the
gods, the supermen technically, mo-
rally, ccnceptionally . . These
men are not only in tune, but they
made the song, "they're the van—
guard.” Each oi the periormers
expressed a desire to remain or to
return at a future date to rap with
the students about the exciting things
they are doing, especially Tolliver,
who is involved in the Black Art-
ists Guild which aids the youthful
black artist in beginning his career.
Concerning his own performance,
Lytle commented that he felt physir
cally exhausted after the weekend
and was unable to start thinking
about the upcoming play rehearsals
he is to be involved with. “The
older 1 get, I can’t switch irom bag
to bag," said Ly‘lle, who also added
that while it was frustrating not
to be able to switch, it was also a
rewarding and beautiful experience

Set New Political Policies

by John Wylie

Revised policies concerning pol-
itical activities on Campus were
agreed upon early this week by the
Administration and the SGA Cabin
net. The revised regulations, out-
lined completely in a Tuesday lets
ter irom President Leggett to the
Campus Community, now allow tor
Stuffing of political material in cam-
pus mailboxes provided certain con-
ditions are met.

Several stuffings oi material sup-
porting the Mezvinsky and McGovr
ern campaigns raised concern on the
part oi the Admutistration. Citing
tears that the College's non-profit
Status with the InternalRevenue Ser-
vice might be Jeapordized by such
activities, Business Manager Ralph
Pomerenk reiterated the guidelines
against political stuitings, and had
at least one halted.

A statement from the administrar
tion was then drafted and, after Con-
sultation with both SGA and Faculty
leaders, was revised into the door
ument released Tuesday,

Mailbox stuffings are permitted

under the revised guidelines, pro-
vided that advance permission ior
the stuffing is obtained irom either
Mr. Pomerenk or Ernie Renaud in
the Campus Post Office, Political
material must also carry the name
oi the person distributing it, and a
notice that ii any college iacilities
or equipment were used in pre-
paring the circulars, they werepaid
for with non-College funds.

Campus buildings will be available
ior organizational meetings at pol-
itical groups under the new ruling,
according to Student Coordinator
Craig Kugisaki. Such meetings will
be treated like any other student
gatherings, and must be open to all
members oi the Campus Commune
ity,
other political vents, such as

lowed to use College buildings and

SAGA Goes Natural

ItvailSthbidllIlitI-l

Saga Food Service will serve a
“natural foods” dinner Monday,0c—
tober 9 in both dining halls. For
students who think thatnaturalioods
means only carrot juice, calves
spleen, and rosehip tablets, the
special meal should prove educa_—
tional as well as a tasty change
irom the “plastic” iare generally
available on the market.

Natural foods, as defined by the
people who sell them, are grown
and produced with minmurn change
from how the foods occur in nature,
that is, with minimum adulteration.
Crops are grown without chemical
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides,
or iungicides. Animals are raised
on these crops and are not given
hormones or antibiotics. ln prepar»
ation, the food is modified as little
as possible, and chemical additives
ior color, texture, ﬂavor, or shell
life are not used,

Monday’s menu will consist of the
following: Hamburgers, soybean
casserole, turkey»rice soup,
apple-ricesdate casserole, as
well as familiar and not so
familiar condiments, vegetables,
salad, fruits, and dessertssuch
as apples, strawberries. apple
butter, sassairas tea, ice cream,
and carob cake and cookies. Some
of the ingredients will include all

naturally produced beei, soybeans,
wheat germ, turkey, brown rice,
honey, raw sugar, sea salt, and
carob which is similar to choco—
late but has more protein and less
fat.

According to adherents,the ratlone

health. For example. much Amer,
ican beef contains residues oi such
antibiotics and hormones asthe ieed
additive diethylstllbestrol (DES)
which has been discovered recently
to he a possible carcinogen The
3,000 permitted iood additives are
also suspect because of inadequate
testing procedures.

The natural foods people, as well
as nutritionists, agree that the re-
fining of food removes certain nu—
trients necessary for a balanced
diet. in raising crops withoutchem-
icals, natural foods farmers arenot
sacrificing nutritional value ior
maximized production and are em—
ploying environmentally soundpraCr
tices. Hopelully, the increased use
of natural foods will widen themal‘r

sell them and thus lower their
prices,

“I try not to think about it in a

in addition, Lytle observed that
he had become aware oi the truth
of the statement “classical music
plays you, you don’t play it,” When
an artist plays classical music,
he practices it until it lS under his

turns it around, to make him ieel

SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

Policies Vary Widely

by John Wylie

Grinnell’s three financial institu-
tlolis--Ginnell State Bank, Power
shiek County National Bank, and
Grinnell Federal Savings and Loan,
have markedly different policies a-
hoot opening and maintaining student
sayings accounts.

F. Addison Jones, President of the
Grinnell State Bank, told the Still?
in an interview last week that the
bank's normal policy was to reiect
student requests ior savings ac-
counts "because that’s not really
what they want ”

Jones explained that most students
who came into the Bank wanting
to opena savings accountwere really
interested in an account from which
they could make treuuent cashwith-
drawals,

By his definition (and that oi the
other bankers who talked with the
sub) a savings account requires
a lalrly substantial balance, inadtl-
ition to a fairly stable character
An account which ﬂuctuates often
and which has a consistently low
balance simply does not qualiiy, as
a savings account, according to
Jones.

l-lis bank’s policy is to suggest
to students wishing to open such
accounts that they instead consider
a checking account The bank does,
he added, make special exceptions
in the cases of students who candeme
unstrate that they really need a
savings account, These are usually
those students who already have a
checking account, and whohave some
iorm or regular income they wish
to deposit and have earn interest.

Jones summarized by tellilig the
5&3 that, “We must serve the pub,
lic, and part oi that responsibility
is to maintain the bank in sound
condition.” Since the Bank has found
that savings accounts are more exr
pensive to open than checking ac
counts, Small accounts which are in
reality being used as checking ac
counts cost the Bank money, and
cannot be justified.

Poweshiek County National Bank’s
policy seems to be a bit more ilex-
ihle., Mary 13. Donahoe, Cashier
of the Bank. told the 5818 that Powe-
shiek National was happy to open
student savings accounts as long as
the student already maintained a
checking account, and as long as
a minimum balance of $5.00 was
maintained in the savings account.

Miss Donahue also noted that the
bank would make exceptions to the
“checking account first” rule lnthe
case of a student who wanted to de-
posit tuition ior second semester
during the first semester This, she
told us was a legitimate purpose
ior a savings account, and the bank
was usually willing to open such ac
counts,

She added that the bank welcomes
student business, and offers serr
vices which students generally may
not be aware of, This, she told the
$31.3, is one reason ior the bank's
service charges, and for the re-
quirements it maintains for opening
savings accounts.

Grinnell FederalSavings maintains
the most flexible policy of the three
local institutions concerning student
accounts, Mr, Martin O. O’Connor,
the Association’s President, told the
SkB in a telephone interview that,
”We welcome them in any iorm they
(the students) want them,"

He said that while some student
saVings accounts required a bit more
work than otheraccounts, his Assoc-
iation’s policy was to welcome all
accounts as long as a minimum bal—
ance of $1.00 was maintained.

Each account. he told us, costs
the Association about 25¢ per month
for time on the Chicago computer
which handles the “bookkeeping”
ior savings accounts. Thus, he said,
an account with a $10 or $15 bal-
ance is not profitable.

At this time, the Association has
no plans for making accounts more
difficult to open. If it ever became
necessary to require a higher minie
mum, or some other kind oi re-
striction to opening accounts, Jones
added, the new regulations would be
applied uniformly to all the Associ—
ation’s potential customers—mot
just to Grinnell College students.

Grinnell Federal Savingsdoes have
one disadvantage, however henoted.
Its offices are closed all day Sat-
urday. making advance planning a
necessity for those who maintain
accounts there. Both Poweshiek
and Grinnell State maintain Saturr
day office hours.

Grinnell students can open savings
accounts in Grinnell lf theyare per—
sistent But each of the town’s fi-
nancial institutions has a different
policy—»and students should be
aware ol‘ them beiore they go in
with their first deposit

TO FULFlLL NEEDS

careiul not to get into a rut. A
person may ieel pressured to do the
same things all the time, althoughhe
doesn’t want to.

Bob likes the varied activities he
has lound at Grinnell. Heieels things
are moving, something important to
the lite-style, he has chosen. The
only complaint he makes is thatpers
haps they are moving too iast. This
last pace has not allowed him time
to completely organize his thoughts

How does an RA spend his time?
This one manages to keep pretty
busy, Aside irom his principle work
as a resident advisor, Bob is also
associated with Career Services,
Revolving Door and Dr. Castor’s en-
counter group. Any tree time is

spent jogging, iolk dancing or as an
IM football referee. Bob is also
learning to swim, an especially am-
bitious and challenging project at
his age.

The position as RA, Bob ieels,
is gratifying because he can create
it out of what he came here with,
rather than try to mold himself
to the job. Individualism, it can be
seen, is an important factor of his
life. A great concern of his is that
people will see him only as his role
as RA portrays him, notasaperson.

What Bob does after this year at
Grinnell remains to be seen. He sees
it as a piece to a jigsaw puzzle wait.
ing to find the place he will fit.
