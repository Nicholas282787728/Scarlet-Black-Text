Scarlet and Black netmen set

aside Monday and Tuesday to
do a little work in preparatiun
for the conierence meet.

The workouts involved gave
the tennis boys two more wins
for the season as they put
down Drake 470 and the next
day dropped Cornell Sal. This
gave the Pioneers a 5—3 record
in dual outings for the season.

Although Drake could only
bring three players» because of
scholastic difficulties, they were
probably glad they had no
more here. Bob Dibble and Bob
Skrainka won in love sets. Herb
Huebsch was victorious in the
third singles match, while Jim
Mafﬂtt and Fritz Little took
the doubles. Skrainka, in his
singles match, deleated Thomps
son to gain revenge tor the
loss to the Drake man last
year,

Cornell didn’t fare much bet
ter. The Pioneers salted away
a victorious home record by
pouring over the Rams.
