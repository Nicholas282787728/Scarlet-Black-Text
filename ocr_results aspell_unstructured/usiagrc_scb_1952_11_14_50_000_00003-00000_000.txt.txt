proval from Six new foreign

ZIYAD BARQ, whose home is
in Amman, Jordan, received his
first impression of the congenial
atmosphere at Grinnell when a
host oi tellow students greeted
him upon,his arrival in Langan
hall.

“Jim," as he is known to his
friends. entered Grinncll as a
sophomore this year after at-
tending Greenville college in
Illinois when he arrived in
this country in 1951. A preemed
student. he is concentrating on
his BA in science at Grinnell.

“IT IS GOOD, but sometimes
hurts," was Eyad Hadi’s cheer-
ful observation concerning
Grinnell prepping. In his trav-
els through 13 states. he has
found all Americans kind and
friendly and Grinnel] no ex-
ception. He is especially pleas—
ed with the friendliness shown
by the faculty that uses what
he calls, “the best way of
teaching."

Hadi is also iavorably im—
Dressed with the social system
at Grinnell. Here he has found
an opportunity to take an ace
tive part in the activities that
are so different from those at
his home in Ramallah, Jordan l

Known on campus as “Ed,”
Hadi is a Smith sophomore ma-
joring in economics. Later he
hopes to go into petroleum en-
gineering.

Not all Grinnellians were
slrangers to Ed when he ar-i
rived on campus. He and Davidl
Qutub, whose home is also in‘
Ramallah, were friends when
they went to school together
back in Jordan.
