After 70 minutes of desperate

ball team once more demonstrated
its superiority over the Iowa State

Saturday afternoon, by the score
of 23 to o. The game had long
been looked forward to as one of
the hardest propositions which

. the local team would have to face
this season. That this was no idle
fear was well proved when for the
thirtyeﬁve minutes of the ﬁrst half
the teams surged back and forth
over the ﬁeld in as hard a struggle
as the history of Ames»Grinnell
contests has to record,

The'iiip of the penny showed
Ames to have drawn ﬁrst blood

fend the south goal, with a strong
wind at his back, For Grinnell,
Clark kicl<ed off to Daniels on
Ames’ IOeyard hoe, who made
one of the prettiest returns of the
day, carrying the ball 20 yards be-

Simpson Team Coming Prepared to Win

in Friday’s Game

Preparations Being Made for

a Large Delegation of Rooters

«Special Train to be Secured

MASS MEETING THURSDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:15

On next Friday afternoon the
thoughts of all football enthuv
siasts in the state will be centered
upon Ward Field, at the
referee's signal, a game will begin
important
questions will be decided. The

ﬁrst is. whether or not Grinnell

state championship, and the sec-
ond is whether or not Simpson
will succeed in her long-cherished
ambition to put an end to the
“big four" combination, and force
her recognition as an equal. Both
these questions cannot be answers
ed in the afﬁrmative. a fac't which
is well recognized by both teams,
Simpson defeated
Drake, and inspired by that VlCr

has already

tory will come to Grinnell with a
deterniination‘to win, and will
light for victory until time is
called at the end of the game.

As is so frequently said, com
parative scores are never entirely
satisfactory, but a glance at the
records of the two teams during
this season, will reveal the inter
esting fact that they are quite
evenly matched, with the odds
slightly in favor of Simpson.

In the ﬁve gnmes she has plays
ed with college teams. Simpson
has piled up a total of 87 points,
against the 21 points of her Dpr
ponents. In two of these games
no score was made against her.

In the ﬁve games which Grins
nell has played she has scored 34
points against 10 for her ope
ponentsr In three of these games
no score was made against Grinr
nell, Simpson has scored in
every game she has played; Grin.
nell has failed in one. Three of
the teams which Simpson has
played~Drake, Cornell, and Des

Moines Collegeillave also played

with Grinnell. In these three
games Simpson won by a total of
7i points against i5. With the
some teams Grinnell won with 61
points against To. In the games
with Drake and Cornell, the scores
were to to 5, and 27 to lo, re-
spectively in favor of Simpson.
in the gas ‘lGrinrtcll playr
ed with these teams the scores
were 6 to 5 and n to 5, respect
ively in‘favor of Grinnell. From
these brief comparisons it would
seem that Simpson is a little the
stronger.

But whatever may be the con!
clusion we reach as to the strength
of the teams, one thing is evident.
The game next Friday will bear
battle royal. Neither team can
win without the hardest and
hercest kindrof playing through
out the entire game. it is safe to
assert that this game will furnish
one of the best exhibitions of
fast, snappy. hard football that
has ever been seen on Ward
Field. ‘

Another thing is as clear as the
noon day sun; Grinnell can win
this game only through the en-
thusiastic, persistent, and united
efforts of all the students. The
team has the ability and the en»
durance to come Cut victors, if
they receive the kind of support
which is their due. Let them
know by the presence of the en-
tire college, both faculty and stu-
dents, that the old “Grinnell
spirit" is neither dead nor sleeps
mg. So many Simpson rooters
are planning to come, that their
management is trying to secure a
special train to bring them here.
To defeat a team supported in
this way is a hard proposition, and
can only be accomplished by a
team that is supported equally
well.

The following brief analysis is
submitted for the sake of those
interested:

The Bruch concertois one ofthe
few great violin Concertos. It is
great not only in the demands
made upon the players‘s techni-
que, but is a most thoroughly
poetical work. The ﬁrst and
last movements abound in rich
harmonies, strong rhythm, and
brilliant flashes of virtuosity. The‘
second movement is as beautiful
an adagio as has ever been writ-
ten. The expressive possibilities
of the vio'in have ncvcr been
more perfectly realized than in
thiswondeifulmovement, In pure
nobility of conception it may rank
with the great adagios of Beetho-
ven and Miss Fed's artistic endow~
merit may well be judged by her
interpretation of it.

The Berccuse from Jocelyn has
been played by the Amphion Or-
chestra, and is fairly familiar.

The Hungarian Dance is one of
a setof typical Hungarian melo-
dies composcd for the orchestra
by Jollnannes Brahms, and sub»
sequently arranged for the violin
by the great Joachim. This one,
the ﬁfth, is the most brilliant and
striking of the set.

The last number is a virtuoso
piece. pure and simple, in the
form of a set of variations on the
well-known Austrian Nati 0 n al
Hymn. It is brilliant and showy.
and makes the most excessive
demands on the player’s ability
and endurance,
