Now that one quadrennial media
event is over, we can now turn our
attention to the other, the 1988
Winter Olympics. Sports that were
once passionately ignored now
emerge to the ioretront oi dinner
conversations, People proudly an-
nounce that they have watched
iour hours oi luge, a statement
which used to he a cry tor serious
psychiatric help But the Olympics
do more than acquaint Americans
iviih odd sports. This event unites
Americans into jingoistic irenzy
oi psuedo-patriotism. The royal
"we” becomes entwined in our
Viewing. Why didn't "we" win
hockey? Why do "we'" stink in
hobsledding? Why do the Russian
judges hale “us"? The purpose oi
Baron Pierre de Coubertln '5
Olympic creation was to unite peo-~
ple [mm across the world through
the brotherhood oi sports But to
day the Olympics serve to unite
country against country in a

After all, it there weren't a ilag alr

the Olympics are not intrinsically
boring; t is just that the American
sports viewer has better sports to
watch, like arena football, stock-
car raciilg, and golt. But for two
weeks in every tour years,
American dutiiully plop
themselves in iront oi the televi-
sion set to watch the world’s
greatest sporting spectacle What
the American viewer sees are un
familiar sports, with incomprehen-
sible rules, periormed by athletes
with unpronounceable names, For
the American viewer, the world's
greatest sporting spectacle seems
to be irom the Planet oi the Apes.

The events and the names have
no meaning. but through rooting,
we as viewers can create meaning

is a battle or East versus West, We

“USA! USAl.” praying [or divine

means that we Americans have
won World War III and have pro

American Victors become instant
iiverstar heroes After all. is Mike
Eurzlone an icon today because he
was a good hockey player or
because he beat the Russians? It
doesn’t matter that ive never cared
about these athletes beiore the
Olympics, It only matters that they
wore the red. white, and blue when
they beat the Big Bad Bear. In the
end. it is not how the Olympic
games were played. but rather, did
the United States win more medals
than the Soviet Union?

When the two weeks end, when
Jim McKay has ended his last

iinished mispronouncing Polish
surnames, when Frank Gifford has
stopped wearing the L L. Bean
catalog, and when Dick Button has
completed his xenophobic jeering

athletes, ior whom we once
tirelessly cheered, will become
simply answers to trivia questions.

voice of Jim McKay by the shrill of
Dick Vitale But come February
1992, we Americans will be back in
iront of the television, yelling our
heads 0“ for the good old USA and
whining about why we can't beat
the Russians.

_Reinbold exclaimed, “They show-

The success oi the women was
highlighted by Adrianne Clark's
llrstrplace iinish in the lowmeter,
Abbey Green's high~junlp title. and
Barbara Duiirin’s scoring in tour

probably not stake out the
bedroom oi the president or vice
president. students may judge the
actions oi their elected leaders
more harshly: “That’s the person
who represents the students7 who
represents me?” Or. "You Can't do
that. you're an oiilcial." A can
didate must be able to Withstand
and to some extend resist the
pressures oi some superhuman eXr
pectations, while still carrying
him/herseli in a manner ap
propriate to reasonable expecta
tions oi a leader.

Experience. organization, com»
munication. and ability to deal
with celebrity status are part at
what qualiiies individuals to be
SGA president and vice president.
There are. oi course, many more
qualities that determine a Suc-
cessiul leader. Some would argue
that l have leit out the most impor
tant qualities, imagination and
creativity. My ieellng, however, is
that although imagination and
creativity are important. ii the
candidate Cannot handle the prac-
tical strains 0i holding high SGA

Gary Hart will tell you that ideas
alone do’ not make for a great
elected ofﬁcial. Voters must
evaluate work habits. experience,
and personality in addition to ideas
and statements. it may be hard,
but it is the only way to choose ef~
fettive student leaders. I en-
courage everyone to think of the
total job oi SGA president and vice
president when choosing a can-
didate. Remember, you're voting
ior someone who will represent
you, the Grinnell College student,
to the rest of the world (or at least
as far as Nollen House). Be sure to
select the best person {or the job.

 

Jones jumped his best at this meet,
iinishing iirst in the long jump and
iourth in the triple jump. Greg

time oi 4:091 and also won the

As Saniord-Reinbold said. “This

mances at this weekend‘s upcomr
