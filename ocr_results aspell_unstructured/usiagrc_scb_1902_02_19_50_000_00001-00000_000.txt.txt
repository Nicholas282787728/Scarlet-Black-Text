than it has been our custom to

is expected that there will be one

the time of the state games at
Des Moines on the twenty-third
of May. including, of course, the
State High School meet on May

en,below, that every meet will
come on Saturday, except the
State Meet the
Triangular whose date has not yet
been

and possibly

deiinitely decided upon.
The tact that the usual date ior
theStatc Meet. the last Friday in
May. falls on Memorial day. has

had the effect ot making things a

week earlier all around. but as the
spring vacation is also a week
earlier than is customary, the
training period after the opening
of the spring term will be of usual
and proper length. The three
meets that will be held at Ward
Field all promise to be especially
interesting. and if no unforeseen
accidents occur we may feel sure
that the new track will be auspici-
ously initiated, Here is the

COLLEGE, GRINNELL.

IOWA, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY

 

UNCLE SAM’S CLUE.

The proposition to erect a permanent club house to be under the
supervision of college authorities, is meeting with favor from faculty,

students and townspeople,

over two hundred dollars have already
been pledged. and two hundred more are in sight.

Many are urging

that a thousand dollar investment be made, but the cost of the build-

ing probably will not exceed six or seven_hundred dollars.

About

one-third otthe cost is being pledged by the college students and

the faculty.

According to the plan proposed. the building will be a
one-story structure, 30x30, with a good basement.

The basement

will contain the furnace. and manual training room.7a room 20x30,

which will be ﬁtted up with benches, tools, etc.

The work of the

training school will be systematically organized next year under the

direction of a competent overseer.

The tnain ﬂoor will conthin the

entrance hall and club roomithe latter to be 20x30, with a 12 foot

ceiling.

tables, cosy corners. etc.
during the spring vacation.

Opposite the entrance will be a large brick ﬁreplace.

GAME WITH WESTERN NEXT
SATURDAY.

February 22 (or the third time
this season our basket ball boys
will line up against an opposing
college team, the contest this
time being with Western College
of Toledo. The Toledo team
comes here with a good record
behind it. It has played several
games this season, winning all but
the one with the State University.
This is the only defeat Western
has received at basket ball since
the introduction of the game
there. ‘

The lineup oi the Grinnel] team
will probably be the same as last
Saturday. In the game with
Western last year Grinnell was
defeated, and the desire to even
up this game will act as an added
incentive for our team to play the
best game ot which it is capable.
With these prospects ota good
contest, the students should give
the team the encouragement of
their presence at the game.

 

VALENTXNE PARTIES.
Saturday evening the Etlson
House girls entertained twenty
two of their friends at a valentine
party. The rooms were decorated

tainment in the form of an auction.
After a two course luncheon the
guests enjoyed vari us games the
remainder of the evening.

The same evening another party
was in progress at the Snyles
house. About twenty gathered
in honor of St. Valentine and to
enjoy the hospitality ot the girls.
Messages were written by each
by using the letters of the word
valentine as initials of the words,
fortunes were told by means of
valentines. and other games ofa
similar nature were played. Re~

freshments of ice cream. cake and
candy were served.
