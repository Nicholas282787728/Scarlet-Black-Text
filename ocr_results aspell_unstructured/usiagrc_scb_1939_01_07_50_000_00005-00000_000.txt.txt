Reporl for
Daily Drills

First Indoor Meet
of Season to Be

During February

By Clark A. Smith.

Coach C. Lester Duke already
has his Pioneer thin clads l'eportr
ing for daily practice in prepara_
tion for the indoor season.

The schedule for winter meets
has not been released as yet, but
the first meet will be held around
the middle of February.

To date, the eight available
returning lettermen reporting to
Duke are Ted Applequist, sprint»
er; Paul Baichly and Burke-Pow-
ers, hurdlers; Robert Cranny and
Robert Hagan, quarter mllers;
William Pedersen and Harold See-
ger, middle distances; and Frank
Pfohl, high jumper and hurdlen

Powers also specializes in the
broad jump.

Ca-captains Not Arallahle

Carcaptains Fred Luther and
Vern Robinson will not be avail-
able for the indoor season, being
members of the basketball squad.
The former is a hurdler and a
quarternniler, w ile Robinson con-
fines his track work to the pole
vault.

The loss of last year's carcap-
tains, John Hayward and Lynn
Schlottcrbeck, will be keenly felt,
according to Duke, Hayward was
a versatile performer in both
track and field events, while
Schlotter-beck was a crack 440
and 350 man

A dozen other men with track
aspirations are reporting to Duke
Howard True, Robert Jones. Raye
mond Crossman and Fred Delgar-
_tolo have all had some track ex
perience from previous years and
may develop into letter winners.
Eight Sophomores.

The other eight men are new-7
comers to the thin clad squad and
are luainly sophomores. They are
Edward Walters, Gene Wulfing,
John Strome, .Neuman Fell, George
Finch, Ed Wczesny, George Lind-
strom and Mark Moody. All these
men have shown some promise

but their true abilities are as yet
untested.

Coach Duke is in hopes that
more men \Vlll report for track.
whether they've had experience or
not.

Duke Urges Freshmen.

"We have 11 seniors on the
squad, eight of which are letter-
mcn. This means we must begin
building for next year," he eats
plained. “I hope any fellow that
thinks he can run, or would like
to find out if he could, will re-
port to me as soon as possible.
We must have more men out.”

In this respect, Duke also urges
