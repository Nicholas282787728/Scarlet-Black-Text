to help the Grinnell eleven as
they went down to defeat, 20-6,
at the hands of Carleton last
Saturday on Ward tield.

The Pioneers got off to a
good Sta-rt, scoring first early in
the second quarter on a nifty
thirty yard romp by halfback
Nick Ryan. Taking the ball on
a handotf f-rom quarterback Bob
Norton, Ryan wheeled between
his own left end and tackle for
six points. John Dunlop missed
the conversion but the Pioneers
were out in front. so.

The Carls quickly retaliated
with Smdbakken going over for
the TD. Smebakken also at-
tempted the conversion for the
Knights and missed. Half time
score was Grinnell 6, Carls 6.

The Knights scored once in the
third quarter and again in the
final period on runs by Voss and
conversions by Smebakken to
rack up their third win of the
season 20-6 over winless Grin—
hell.

statistics tell the story as
Carleton gained 335 yards to the
Pioneers 225 with 21 first downs
for Carleton against ll for Grin-
nell. Grinnell gained 152 yards
rushing and 73 yards passing.
The Scarlet and Black attempted

rates as one of the league’s‘
best. The big surprise was the
Knight's backfield. Though
rated the poorest in the con-
ference. the backfield looked
as good as any I've seen this
season. The Carl backs were
big, fast, and ran hard.

Many of the Pioneers played
but John McCiine
tock was in a class by him-
self. The burly Scarlet and
Black linebacker was all over
the field, playing 60 minutes
of real football. He averaged
45 yards on 'four punts, and

was in on most of the tackles.

THE THVIE of year is ap-
proaching when AlleConference

and AlermeriCan teams start
coming out a dime a doben. In
many cases they are a big
farce. Some schools agree to
push a player of another school
if the latter will back one of
their own men. Ridiculous as
these polls are, they still ap-
pear year after year and will
probably continue to do so.
From the 1952 Pioneer squad,
at least the following three
boys deserve to be placed on
the Midwest conference team:
John McClintock _ defensive
linebacker; Chuck Dunham —
offensive halfback; and Ron
Frank—defensive guard. ;
other boys have turned in
top notch performances for
