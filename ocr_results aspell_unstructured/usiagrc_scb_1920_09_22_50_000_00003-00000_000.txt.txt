WHAT DO YOU THINK
(Continued trout page 3.)

It is not too early to begin
discussion 0! the proposed amend—
ment.

In considering the question,
:must consider hoth the students, and
’tho college, that is, tho good or the
students here, and the reputation and
lhniction of the college here and
abroad, Above all, the administration
and faculty, who as a rule object to
‘the changing of such “traditions",

we

must.khow that as a whole the stu-
dents are not selfish in their requests
when such agitations are brought he»
tore the school, but rather they are
sincere in their belief that the change‘:
is for the good or the school.

So it is in this case. 1 helieve that
the Sunday date restriction should he
withdrawn, hcth for the goal] of the
students, and tor the good ol the col-
lege.

Taking the reputation of the college
as a reason, it seems that present day
ideas and ideals no more (if they ever
did) support the idea that Sunday
dating is improper. With popular
sentiment for the change, as I believe
is no doubt is the puts
the college in the light at the much
famed “Sunday school college” if such
is restriction exists.

on the other hand, for the good of
the students, Sunday is the logical
time to "entertain men and women to-
gether”. Sunday is a day or rest.
Sunday is a day or callers. At pres-

Case, it

cut it is an open secret that girls ac-
cept dates on Sunday nights, if they
feel that the risk is not too great, but
they have to Wait till. the cover of
darkness, rather than have callers on
Sunday afternoon, which is much
desirable to most people than Sunday
nighm. Sunday afternoon is it more
of less uninteresting period, I admit
that. We have heard. tales DE how

I believe that both tor the good or

that a great deal more harm coinosl

that the removal or me rule would he
