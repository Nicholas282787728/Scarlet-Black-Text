reference to God. and a title rele-

language must have."

The single goal was scored

rison and Jim Bur-1mg carrying.

According to a prep poll, there
are no hard feelings held in spite‘
of the injuries that resulted.

Assisted by the college choir,

purpose of church music should
‘be for the worship and glory of
God, a return in kind of God’s

The choir sang rour hymns
which exemplified the ideals Dr.
lDavlson presented in his lectures.
"Music offers the greatest Op-
