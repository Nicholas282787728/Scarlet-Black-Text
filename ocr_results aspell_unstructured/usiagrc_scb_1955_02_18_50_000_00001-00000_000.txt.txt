Reid Finds That Student Unibnr
Compares Well to Other Schools

“In comparison to other

schools both large and small,

we found that Grinnell’s llnion is on top, for even though
we may think our union is small and only temporary, it

seems that it is utilizing What

it has to the best advantage.”

Thus remarked Marilyn Reid, union chairman, after re-
turning from a conference of the Association of College
Unions Members last Saturday, held at Ames. Grinnell was
also represented by Steve Jones and John Egan at the con-
ference, which included fifteen schools both large and small
from Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas.

Among the numerous con-
ference discussions in which
Grinnelrs representatives took
part were topics on methods of
publicity and new avenues of
programming for the small
umon.

However, Marilyn said.

lems in, either of these areas."
She went on to say that the
Grinnell’s union publicity is
adequately handled by KGRW,
the scarlet and Black, the so~
cial coordinating committee
and other campus outlets. Con»
cerning programming she ex
plained that at Grinnell the
union committee is given freew
dom and support by the ad-
ministration and student coun—
cil in planning its program,
“so that there is no conflict here
either."

Some of the schools repre-
sented commented that they
rented their unions to dif-
ferent organizations. now-
ever, at Grinncll, where the
union is the center of all so-
cial life, “the union is for
student purposes at all times
and may not be rented for

private housepartles and other '

organizational functions. This
followed a union-social ruling
last spring," Marilyn added.
There prevails also at our
union a more informal atmos-
phere compared to that at other
schools. This may be due to
the fact that "students come
pletely run our union, whereas
at other schools often the

hostess for Younker lounge and

She came from Fairmont, West
Virginia where she was the cola

Fairinont State College.

in favor of a Thanksgiving va-
cation was not strong enough
to merit any_action by the Stu-
dent Council. The vote last
Monday indicated that only a
small majority of the students
favored a vacation and Kitten
said that she felt “the issue
should be dropped."

As a part of the Student
Council election, questions were
asked about whether students
favored a Thanksgiving vaca—
tion and whether students would
leave campus if there were one

There were 352 votes for a
Thanksgiving vacation and 281
votes opposing it. of those vot-
ing in favor of a vacation, 217
students favored the elimination
of victory day and one day of
spring vacation, and so preferr-
ed the elimination of two days
of Christmas vacation.

Results of the question on
whether students would leave
the campus if there were a va—
cation were more meaningful.
There worc in; students who
said they would leave, and 135
who said thcy Wouldn't.

According to Kitten
last vote indicated that “the
ash istl'ation argument that
not many students would leave
is weak.” In a letter to the
Student Council, Miss Gardner
had explained that this was one
of the considerations that had
led toithe rejection of Thanks-
giving vacation proposals.

monial dinner honoring Dr. Joseph Dunner, chairman of

8le Hall Blaze '
Allayed to Pranks

Four hundred dollars worth of
books and college property were
destroyed by fire Saturday in
the .room of Dave Cochran in
Smith hall. The lire was dis
covered by Dave Datcsnian
around 9:20 p.11]. in the base~
niem room of Cochran. Dates
man was joined by Bob Phelps,
Jothn Der-her and Ron Veverka,
and the group began to put out
the fire by hall iii-e extinguish—
ers. The fire was almost out
when the Grinnell Fire Depart
ment arrived and finished ex—
tinguishing the blaze.

Andy Ono, who lives, across
the hall from Cochran, found a
burning cigarette stuck in a
pack of cigarettes lying on his
desk when he returned from a
shower earlier in the evening.
HIS desk was scarred but he
managed to remove the danger
before any serious damage was
done. '

"The

fires origin was unv
known,” stated Dean of Men
Henry Brown commenting on
the Cochran fire, "The two tires
(fetal-ring to the Cowles hall
lire and this one) this year were
probably a icsult of horseplcy
or pranks and certainly not
very intelligent,” ’

Three fire extinguishers were
used from Smith hall and a
couple were borrowed from
bangan hall. oiie fire extinguish
er was tound to be empty. Fire
extinguishers are checked an.
nually stated Dean Brown, and
"if students use fire extinguish-
ers for pranks then they expose
other Students as well as them-
selves to loss of property and
possibly worse.”

The college doesn’t carry in-
surance to cover the loss of
student property in case of a
fire. However, if in some way
the damage is due to the school’s
negligence, then bhe student is
covered by insurance. Dean
Brown recommended that stud—
ents find out if they are cov-
eredwith insurance by policies
of their own or of their parents.
