Snowflakes 'Are Lo

11er to Look Upon,

But Give Me Hearthfire, Says Poet

By stun Hipp

The snowflakes gently downward
fall; they cover up the barren
ground; in chaste white robes ap-
parelled all, they nestle down with
out a sound. They clothe the nak-
ed soil in white; they bind earth’s
bleeding wounds up tight, and make
the earth look pure and bright for
miles and miles around. Like gentle
doves the snowflakes fly: they
softly settle on the land. I love to
see them winging by, and at Amy
window, charmed 1 stand. The flocks
of fluffy ﬂakes perform; as breezes
stretch them filiform, they spin and
swing and swirl and swarm. Let's
give the little whirl a hand.

I look me from the window out,
and l exclaim to see the show; the
world seems virgin and devout.
whenever it is covered so. I stand
beside my glowing fire, while als-
baster flakes inspire, and so I strum
upon my lyre to see the falling

snow.

But when the snowstorm I must
brave, and venture forth a freezing
night, when slushy snowbanks make
me rave and falling flakes obscure
my sight, ah then it is a different
scene that splashes through my bal-
1y bean, and then 1 dream of grasses
green and sephyrs soft and light.
or when 1 rise and greet the dawn,
and plod through driving drifts to
class, I catch the snowﬂakes in my
yawn and stumble into each are»
vasse. I hit 8:20 on the dot, but
on, alas the prof does not, and pic-
turing my empty cot, 1 know I am
a silly ass.

The pesky snow creeps down my
neck; the slush climbs up about my
knees; I catch a. blooming cold, by
heck, and presently I start to sneeze.
The snow, it falls on bill and dale;
it weaves the earth a garment pale,
but when it snows. 1 gladly hail #
my hearthfire, if you please.

 

 

“Let’s Be Merry, for Tomorrow

We Flun ”

“Let’s dance, skate, and be merry,
for tomorrow we may ﬂunk," is the
newly adopted motto of the freshmen,
who are about to brave the trials
and tribulations of Muir ﬁrst college
ﬁnals.

For some four months the bright
and shining army of preps has been
boldly following in the footsteps of
their honored sire. Soon there will
be two hundred wiser full»l-ledged
freshmen.

Already “blue heel-(5,". "Snap-
exam”. "cramming". and "stiff one“
are becoming afamiliar code to the
innocent, unsuspecting babes. The
cruel profs are disturbing their oth—
erwise pleasant existence by drop-
ping such unthoughtful remarks as,
“We shall see in the ﬁnals whether
you have reSlly mastered this or not."

is New Frosh Motto

Perhaps in spare moments they are
even brutal enough to he scribbling
reams of impossible questions in pre-
paration for the fast approaching
days of agony.

Unthinking upper-classmen drop
hints about burning the midnight oil
and laying in a supply of animal
crackers and peanut brittle to aid the
nerve-wracked brain.
A few inspired souls plant them-
selves in the library to consume the
“Encyclopedia Britanica" in pursuit
of a store of knowledge for the
crushing nightmare ahead of them.
But most of the class of '33, remem-
bering that they in some way surviv-
ed thc much heard of term theme
fortify their courage and repeat,
“let's dance, skate and be merry. for
tomorrow we may flunk."

 

 

Campus Organizations at Grinnell
Embrace Every Type of Activity

 

Like others collcges and uni—
verslties, Crinneil has many stu—
dent organizations which contrib-
ute to student life on the campus.
While some of them are well
known to nearly everyone attend—
ing Grinnell, others remain more
or less a mystery to many, who
don‘t belong to them, all the way
through their four years here.

Beginning with this lssne the
SCARLET AND BLACK will pub—
lish a resume of one or two of the
campus organizations describing
something of their purposes and
duties, their functions, and na—
ture of their memberships. This
issue tells about the Council of

House Chairmen and the Women‘s

Self-government league. Ad—

ditional issues wiu describe the

remainder of Grinnell's campus
organizations;

Council of House Chairmen: Stu-
dent supervision of the men's dormi-
tories'is vested in the Council or
House Chairman, a body which is
hardly two years old. Composed of
the six house chairmen and a senior
representative of the town men, the
group meets each Wednesday with
the dean of men to discuss various
problems relating to the men of the
college not only as individuals but as
,a part of the school.

stepping into the shoes left vacant
by the passing of the Men’s Court
rsngle has their own method of stu-
dent rule. This is vested in the W0-

and Men's Senatetthe council has
handled its business very efficiently.
Prepping went its way through the
joint action of this group and the ad—
ministration. Quiet hours, dating
and open houses are a few of the
many problems which this group
has discussed this year.

Women’s Seifrgovernment League.

Like the dormitories the quad—
rangle has their own method of stu-
dent rule. This is vested in the We-
men’s Self-government league. This
well known board was established in
1911 and was the first student gov-
ernment league in the state.

In 1914, with the completion of the
quadrangle, a reorganization took
place which instituted for the league
a fourfold purpose, consisting of reg-
ulating. broadening, and refining the
social life of the college, making the
individual lives of the women more
wholesome, and forming the official
body to correlate and unify the ac-
tivities of women.

The executive powers are vested in
a league elected by the students.
The board consists or a president, six
house chairmen, and a representative
of each class.

year ,has been greatly strengthened
by a fine bunch of energetic fresh»
men who should pull Building One
through to an average number of
wins. Bath, Wenger, and Kisser are
some of last year's men who will be
seen in action again this year.

Moving to Langan hall. we find
two very fair teams and ones that
should stay right in the running.
Langan is hampered by the fact
that two of their best puaycrs, War-
ner and James, will be ineligible due
to freshman basketball. Captain
Kent, Jones, Briggs and Foval are
men of three years' experience who
will probably bear the brunt of work.
while Mccurdy, Hamilton and
Pojman are outstanding among the
freshmen.

Three lacks Quantity

Kelly stables should find no dif-
ficulty in annexing the cellar posi-
tion again this year. Lacking quan-
tity as well as quality, Building
Three will have a hard time with
each and every game, though such
sterling players as Mcintire and Da-
vis are a welcome aid to any team,

Building Four, while enjoying sev»
er'al players who are fine shots and
floor workers, are greatly handicap-
ped in their shortage of players. Al-
though Building Four did manage to
break even last year with their next
door neighbors, it is doubtful weth-
er they can repeat their long line
of victories again this year. Fer-
guson, Bichey, Sweeney and Kuko-
lich are old timers. while Yohe and
Bowlby, as newcomers. should
strengthen the ranks.
Clark hall, last year's champions,
look like the big threat again this
year.” With two weirbalanced teams
led by men like Edwards, Graeber
and Cooper, Building Five should ex-
perience no difficulty in taking most
of the games. Liedtke. Bose, Thomas
and Murray are four others who can
more than hold their own on the has—
ketball court.
Dibble, a menace to all aspirants
in the athletic world, has put a fine
bunch of men into the field. With
Farrara, Nielson, Tipton and Fuller

Miss Peggee Bennett, sophomore
at Grinnell, was hostess to a party
of 200 guests at the Hoyt Sherman

OH GIRLS!

HAVE you seen the new
dresses at PENNYS7
They are just as clever as
can be. Just the right length
to be stylish and in all the
new colors. Shirs, pleats,
and circular flounces all do
their part to make the lines
interesting. And dainty
handkerchief linen collar and
cuff sets add the modish
femlne touch. And isn t is. 90
a perfectly unbelievable
price?

GUESS WHAT
WE SAW IN THE WIN-
DOW AT CHILD‘S

Two Christmas engrav-

nings framed in just the
appropriate moldings. Were
you lucky enough to receive
one swanky enough to add
to your room if properly
framed? And speaking of
framesidon't let the photo
graphs you received for
Christmas be without them
a minute longer. A frame
makesa photograph twice
as effective. And for large
photographs the wall frame
is entirely in vogue.
