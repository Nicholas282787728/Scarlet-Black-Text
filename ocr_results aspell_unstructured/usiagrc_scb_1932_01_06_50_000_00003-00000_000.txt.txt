WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1932

By MAX ROSS

With announcement of the addition
of Butler to the Missouri Valley Con—
ference, comes word that the loop
may he further enlarged by tak-
ing on one or two more schools, st.
Louis university, Marquette, and
Alllsa university are among thosc

suggested as additional entries.

The addition of Butler muy cause
some consternation “hen the tennis
meet those of Creighton and money
since the colors oi all three schools
are blue and white. Incidentally, both
Butler and Drake have the nickname
Bulldogs. :M’Id to muhc matters worse,
one or the addIIianlll possibilities, st.
Louis lnlixersity also is represented

by the Mile and white.

Butler college, which was founded
in 1850 and is situated at Indianap-
olis. has been regarded as one of the
strongest athletic institutions except
Notre Dame, outside of conference hf-
filiatiou. Several seasons ago. many
sport scribes awarded the national
championship to Butler's basketball
five. The new school seems strongest
in basketball and track and come

paratlvely weak in rootball.

To further dullnnstmte the caliber
of Missouri Valley conlercncc basket-
ball, sport writers have already been
mentioning Creighton for the myth-
i nl national championship. Possess-
ing one of the tincst teams in the
history or the school, Coach A. a.
Schobingcr should enjoy a successful
season. baring- already beaten South-
eni Calilcrnia and Brigham Young
univers -

Although the entire team is come
posed of sophomores, Drake has exV
hibited a grim determination and
never—sayvdie spirit in its three early
season games. Even though the Bulb
dogs lost to Grinnell, Iowa state, and
the University of Iowa, the margin
was close in each case. Against Iowa
State's veteran team of four three
year men. they saw victory snatched
away in the final minutes.
