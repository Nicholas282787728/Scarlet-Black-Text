Congress
vbus

Economic issues, Ford’s attempt
to cope with current energy
shortages, and the role of Congress
in determining American ioreign
policy were ~ among the issues
discussed by three Iowa members
of Congress while at Grinnell this
past week. Senators Dick Clark
and John Culver and Congressman
‘Ed Mezvinsky. all Democrats,
were on campus to participate in
the Conference on Food, Famine,
and Foreign Policy.

The three generally agreed on
the question of what alternative
Congress will posit to Ford’s
economic program All suggested
that Ford's tax rebate plan would
probably be enlarged by Congress.

Ford’s plan calls for an across-
the-board 12 per cent rebate for all
taxpayers with income up to $45»
50,000. This rebate would amount
to a total of $12 billion, with an
additional total rebate of $6 billion
to corporations.

Congress will call for a total
rebate of between $20»21 billion,
which would be aimed more
toward middle and lower income
groups than the corporations and
the rich, according to Clark.

Culver also emphasized the need
for a solution to the problem of
unemployment, which he called
“social dynamite" because of its
impact on the young, the
minorities, and the urban areas.

John Culver

While immediate action is
clearly necessary, “the most
important danger," suggested
Culver, “is the danger of doing
anything oi a precipitous character
that would be too severe and would
aggravate the recession." He
called for greater cooperation
between the Congress and the
President and pointed out that the
Congress and the President have
equal responsibility ior dealing
with the problem. He charged that
the President must live up to the
spirit of conciliation which he has
been espousing.

Ford’s proposal for a so tariii on
oil, a 52 excise tax, and a
deregulation of crude oil was op-
posed by all three.

Clark asserted that such a
massive increase in fuel costs,
approaching an increase of $30
billion, would only “drive us
deeper into the recession, \Vhile
clearly being very inﬂationary at
the same time." An energy con
servation program, Clark felt,
should initially cut consumption by

S%

200,000 barrels a day. It should then
be gradually increased until it met
the 1,000,000 barrel a day reduction
called for by Ford.

Mezvinsky termed the concept oi
taritis ”unacceptable." He sup»
ported a fuel allocation system
which would lower consumption to
90 per cent oi current levels. Both
he and Culver spoke of various
means of decreasing consumption,
such as rationing or taxation
automobiles with high horsepower.
The idea of gasless weekends was
also ﬂoated by Culver.

Mezvinsky outlined several
alternative sources oi energy,
including the development of
geothermal or solar energy
sources. Clark seemed to be the
most pessimistic. however. He
argued that in the short run we
must lower our levels of con-
sumption, but that in the long run
we must find alternative sources of
energy. He was unsure about me
likelihood for Success of either
shorts or long-range eiiorts.

Clark and Mezvinsky were
distressed by private American-
military support of ioreign
countries, particularly when
financed by the U.S. government.
Currently receiving attention is the
mercenary torce being employed
by the Vinnell Corporation, using
US. government funds, to train me
Saudi Arabian Internal Defense
Force to protect the Saudi oil fields
from foreign and guerilla attacks.

Mezvinsky was disturbed by the
way in which our involvement was
revealed and called for a
Congressional investigation into
the Whole issue of US. hiring of
mercenary forces. He called for
enforcement oi present legislation,
if applicable, or creation of new
legislation, it needed, to deal with
these types of government action.
Clark termed the mercenary ac
tion “ridiculous” and stated that it
didn't make any Sense. He labelled
it a typical Kissinger maneuver
and pointed out that it was not in
our self-interest. Attention was
called to the fact that several
weeks ago, Secretary Kissinger
had mentioned the possi ty oi
our using force against Saudia
Arabia. The desire for
Congressional investigation was
echoed by Clark.

Both Clark and Culver voiced
disapproval of the Ad-
ministratiun's request for supr
plemental aid to South Vietnam.
Culver call d the request “in-
defensibl The $700 already
allocated is more than sufficient,

from Culver’s point of view. “I

would be Very doubtful that
Congress would appropriate
anymore money in this fiscal year
for South Vietnam or Cambodia,”
speculated Clark. “The President
favors three more years ofsuch aid
with an abrupt cutoff, but I favor a
phase-out of military assistance
over the next mree years."

Clark and Mezvinsky both
defined Congress’ role in setting
foreign policy as theoretically
being one in which the Congress
formulated policy and the Ad
ministration implemented it. At
this point, however, the Executive
branch has assumed too much
control over the formulation of
policy and the Congress has too
little control over its im-
piementation. According to Clark,

to . i k
Ed Mezvinsky

“Congress ought to make policy
and the Administration ought to
implement it, and be given a fair
amount of latitude in that im-
plementation. The trouble is that
when you see violation after
violation after violation of the
policy that the Congress has set up,
then the natural inclination is for
Congress to get in and actuallly
administer the programs, by
putting in all kinds of limitations. .
, .ldeally. we shouldn’t have to put
all those restrictions in it, but what
do you do when it is misused?”

0n the need ior national grain
reserves, a question directly ad»
dressed by the Food Conference,
Culver said that was where a need
for some kind of reserve system in
order to prevent the wild ﬂuc
tuations in cost and supply which in
turn result in instability in the
domestic and world economy. At
the same time, saieguards must be
taken to prevent an overhang on
the market which would depress
the farmers' prices, Culver
commented.

With regard to the movement
towards greater reiorm in the
House, Mezvinsky expecE mat
there will be a more rational
definition of Committee spheres of
jurisdiction. He also predicted
an even greater openness 'in the
Congress, particularly in the
committees, than seen in the past
iew months. He anticipates a
fur-ﬂier reduction in the scope and
power of the seniority system. With
regard to the likelihood of
Congressional adoption or public
financing of Congressional came
paigns, Mezvinsky remarked:
“The institution of reform (in
Congress) is only as good as the
people who are in it."

Cnni
chosen
dean

Susan Crim is the new assistant
dean of Student affairs. She was
chosen Wed. evening after an in-
terviewing session during the
afternoon. Aresident adviser this
year for Cleveland, Main, and
Mears Halls, Crim reacted to her
choice by commenting, “i think i
can do some very good things."

Crim attended Coe College and
University oi Exeter in England,
majoring in English Literature.
Her masters degree was com-
pleted at the University oi
Wisconsin at Madison and her Ph.-
D. is in progress.

Jacobs leaving

Bob Jacobs, who is presently the
Associate Dean of Student Affairs,
is leaving to go “east oi the Ap-
palachians or west of the Sierras."
He is seeking the same position in a
college, departing Grinnell
primarily due to the location and
social life.

Jacobs began as resident adviser
in the fall of 1972 for James and
Haines Halls. His next position was
assistant dean last year.

Selection group

The selection group for replacing
Jacobs included Jim Tederman,
dean oi student affairs: Ray
Obermiller, director of academic
advising, Dianne Ruyffelaere,
associate dean of student affairs;
John Adams, director of Career
Services; and Jacobs. This group
was chosen because most mem—
bers will be Working with the new
dean next year in counseling
capacities. Student Affairs, Career
Services, and Academic Advising
will occupy the building south oi
Nollen House next year, in an
attempt to coordinate all three
types oi student life services.
according to Tederman.

The Committee on Counseling
set up the process of selection,
allowing Tederman to solicit ap»
plications only from within the
campus. Applications were limited
because the nature of the assistant
dean‘s job necessitates a person
(amiliar with the campus,
students, and residence hall
problems, since this dean handles
housing.

Student input

The student input into the
selection process came from the
resident adviser survey recently
issued. These forms. which
Tederman noted were more
positive and complimentary to this
year‘s resident advisers than he
could ever recall, provided the
easiest method of obtaining
student input.

The qualifications for the
position, Tederman explained,
were to relate well to students,
faculty, and administrators; to be
tan and impartial in housing; and
to have administrative skills in
organizing and eiiecting projects.
