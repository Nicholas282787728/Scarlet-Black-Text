The survey which was employed by the
Anthropology i134 class made use or four
diiierent kinds oi questions: direct ques
tions with either yes or no answers,
general questions pertaining to Col-
lege/Community relations. number rank»
ing questions which ask how great friction
is between the College/Community, and
the circling of adjectives which best
describe townspeople or students The ad-
jective question asked students to describe
not only townspeople, but also other
students, Townspeopie were asked to
describe both students and townspeople.

y
students surveyed 75 percent said that

they felt that there was friction between j

the two, oi the townspeople who were
surveyed, 57 percent say that they felt that
there was friction between the two The
difference here is not that great, yet it
seems to show that college students feel
there is more of a problem than townspeo~
ple do

When asked to rank the intensity of fric-

munitylrom.a10t some very little and.

tude‘nts had

none, both townspeople on
nearly the samedistributiion in the son-1
and very little ;categories. There were,
however, a couple of townspeople that teit
that there was no friction and a couple of
students that felt that there was a lot of
iriction. However, the majority oi those
answering that there was indeed friction
felt that this friction was not that intense.

The question was asked whether
students and townspeople wished more
Contact with each other. Fifty-six percent
of the students replied that they wished
more contact with townspeople and 50 per-
cent of the townspeople would like more
contact with students. This question does

. might

not take into consideration the amount oi
time that either students or townspeople
spend with each other. As a result. the 53
percent or those responding "yes” my be
having little or no contact now or the 57
percent that responded "no" may be hav
ing too much contact with each other now

The next questions dealt with adjectives
that the respondents could use to describe
both students and townspeople They were
asked to choose all that they lelt applied.
The ioliowing adjectives were discussed:

The adjective ‘friendly' was applied by
34 percent of the townspeople in describing
students. whereas 56 percent oi the
townspeople described other townspeople
that way students were much harder on
the students: only 58 percent oi the
students described other students as
iriendiy, whereas 72 percent described
townspeople that way.

The adjective ‘snohblsh' was not applied
at all by students to describe townspeople
but 24 percent of the students described
other students as snobbish Only 5 percent
oi the townspeople described students as
snobhish. whereas in percent oi the
townspeople described other townspeople
that way.

Students and townspeople seem to agree
that townspeople are not sloppy No stun
dent applied the. adjective 'sloppy‘ to
townspeople and neither did any townspeo-
ple. Seventeen percent of the students and
13 percent of the townspeople described
students as sloppy

, townspeople as friendly ,

non-mobbish, and helpful.

When the question of ‘tarnilyoriented'
was-asked only to percent or the townspeo
pie described students that way, Zero per»
cent of the students described other
students as being family-oriented, which
indicated that students see
themselves as independent and separated
from their families. Seventyrfour percent

' of the students on'tbe other hand describ-

ed townspeople as being familyoricnted.
whiie as percent of the townspeople see
other townspeople as that

Twenty-four percent or the students
described other students as being 'In-
timidating', whereas no student iound
townspeople intimidating. More students
iound ieliow students intimidating than
they iound townspeople. Only 2 percent ol
townspeople iound students intimidating,
whereas 1 percent iound ieliow townspeor
pie that way,

Seventeen percent or the students
described other students as being 'loud',
whereas 7 percent or townspeople describe
ed students that way Three percent Of the
students ielt that townspeople were loud,
and only 2 percent or the townspeople
described iellow townspeople that way

Townspeople found students
intelligent friendly and
well-mannered.

NEITHER found each

other intimidating!

Finally, only 3 percent of the students
described students as being 'well»
mannered'. whereas 47 percent or the
townspeople described students that way
Thirty-seven percent oi the students
described townspeople as being well
mannered and 34 percent oi the townspeon
pie ielt that way.

One general trend that seemed to appear
in the adjective part oi the survey was that
students were much harder on students
than townspeople Likewise. townspeople
were much harder on themselves than
students. of course, this may be explained
that people Will tend to be harder on their
own peer group, but it we go back to the
lirstquestion' Is there iriction between the
College and the Community, one should
ask why” Students described townspeople
as iricndly, nnnrsnobbish, and helptul, and
did not find them intimidating Towrlspeo
ple iound students to be intelligent, iriend
ly, and wellrmannered, and although they

 

Student helping local boy.

The adjective ‘helpful' appears to apply
to few students, Only 27 percent or the
students and 26 percent oi the townspeople
described students as being heipiul.
However, 75 percent oi the students and 55
percent or the townspeople described
townspeople as being helpiui. Certainiy
students generally ieei that townspeople
are helpiui.

The adjective ‘inlelligent‘ seems to
describe the image of most students.
Seventy-two percent of the students and 87
percent oi the townspeople ielt that
students were intelligent. Only 17 percent
of the students described townspeople as
intelligent, whereas at percent oi the
townspeople described other townspeople
thatway.

did not find students helpful they were not
intimidated by them.

One question that was not asked on the
survey, was whether students felt that
townspeople dislike them 'or whether
townspeople felt that students looked down
upon them, Regardless, there seems to be
some kind at communication gap here,
especially for those who wished that they
had more contact with the other.

One question that was asked was: ii you
feel there is friction, what ways do you see
in solving this? Many felt that the answer
concerned having more events together so
townspeople and students can see that the
other is not so awiui. But a majority
answered that they did not know what
could be done to improve relations. That
seems to be the problem!
