"The Enchanted Cottage" was pre-
sented Friday evening by the Grillilell
College Dramatic Club under the di-
reclioh of Mr. William Angus beiore a
large audience in the High School Aus
ditorium.

The play is neither a comedy nor a
drama. Of the usual sort, but a curious
combination of realism and fantasy,
aptly described by its author, Sir AP
thur Pineru, as “a table in three licts."
Contemporary in its characters and
setting, it presents the old moral of
the transforming power or love, able
to Work. magic with the least promis-
ing materials,

Reality shutters illusion

A waremirnerl invalid and El hope—
lessly plain girl are, in their own eyes
and to the spiritually sharpened sens-
es of a blind man, ll‘anslnu‘terl into it
new and a. heroine oi romance. The
cottage, haunted by the ghosts of old—
time lovers, works its enchanti'ilenl
linew. For though the illusion of phy-
SicaJ strength and beauty is shilhtel'ed
in the cold light of realityijust as in‘
"Chantecler" the illusions ol romantic
idealism are swept aside at the sun
rising—yet Something of unchanging
validity remains. Selfrplty and self-
centered despair give place to new
hope and new courage, The real ‘41»
legory is of a. war-wrecked world that
is not completely crushed while love

, remains to l'ecinimate courage.

“The Enchalited Cntmge" is a difﬁ—
cult play for amateur production, it
depards for success upon a dettness

and ease oi character portrayal that
tax the resources of highly truined ae—

old gratis ol‘ the nineties, young
grads of _ , and Pioneer enthusiasts
turned ollt "en masse” tor the twenty-
seventh annual game between Antes
and Grlnuell last Saturday. The
same grads who have saved the Home-
coming as the one day of the year to
call a holiday, recalled the Homecom-
ing days tor almost a decade past; but
roted this one as one ot the best.

The A. R. H, auditorium, scene of
liery debates, romantic plays and pep
meetings at lormer years, never rs
sounded the s the pep, and Grill-
ncll light as it did on Friday night.
The speeches were punctured with
outbursts oi applause, shoum, and. a
chorus of cowubells. The team was
given a thunderous ovation,

One of the most impressive tealures
of the Homecoming day was the hos~

ber oi the dorms. Each visitor was
shown about the building and intro—
duced. Music was furnished in some
of the club rooms; smokers and was
were given in each building and cot-
tage; open house was held in the-ree—
ulty club; and an liouor‘o reunion
took place in Building Three.

Numerous dinner parties at the
quadrangle dining room lent the tone
of a. formal Varsity dinner, and infor-
