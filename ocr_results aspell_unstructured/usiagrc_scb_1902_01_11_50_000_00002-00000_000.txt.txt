peared the resolution adopted by
the faculty a short time before,
recommending the appointment
of a committee “whose duty it
shall be to watch the work of sttir
dents who are engaged in irrtellec
tual work outside of the class.
suclt as public debates, oraturical
contests and dramatic exhibitions,
and report to the faculty when
the general work ot the student
seems to be suffering from their
outside engagements.” We (lo
not know what the motive was (or
taking this action nor just what H
is expected to accomplish, but we
cannot help but feel that it is a
step in the right direction. We
are glad that the faculty have
taken the matter up, and will give
to the question of these extra due
ties their best judgment.‘ The
conviction has been steadily grow
ing in our mind for some time that
many at the students are attempt
ing too much; that their life is a
too strenuous one,—to use a much
abused expression. It is no intre.
quent thing tor students to be en.
gaged in trom tour to six serious
undertakings, 'n addition to full
college work Indeed. in many
cases, more than the regular
amount of work is being carried
The three lines of work suggested
in the resolution constitute only a
small part of the list which might
be named. Literary societies,

are only a few of the enterprises
which divert the attention otthe
students from their college work.
We are not yet ready to admit that
the classroom work has suflered
as a result oi these extras. but we
are convinced that the health of
many is in danger of being sadly
unpaired. And to our mind, un
der such circumstances, the cost is
entirely disproportionate to the
gain. It is not that these things
are without value. The training
and knowledge gained in an inter
colle» idle debate, the expeiieiice
derived (rom lhe management oi
important student enterprises, and
the instruction gained in musical
organizations and dramatic exlllr
oitions are of very great value, but
of not so great value that it isjusti
ﬁnble to sacriﬁce health and class
room work to attain them. Ber
