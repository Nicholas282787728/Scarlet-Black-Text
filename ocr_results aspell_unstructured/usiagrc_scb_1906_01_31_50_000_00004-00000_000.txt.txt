'02. Last evening’s Herald contains
ed an editorial written by John w.
Gaunaway, taken from the Milwaukee
Journal or which Mr. Gannanny is
editorial writer. The article is en-
titled “Gov. LaFollettels Faults” and
is a criticism or the actions of the
governor. The Journal is an inde-
pendent paper, having the largest cir-
culation in that famous city and has
been a strong supporter of Larollette.

Mn Gannaway says in part.

“it, is agreat misfortune that Gov.
Lanollette should at tireslosecon-
trolofhimsell in this way. It hurts
him far more than he imagines.
Many people heheve him to, be unrer
liable, a sort of demagogue. It is
just such things as these thatgive
them ground Ior their belief. That
little remark the governorwas charged
with having made about hanging the
presidentoi the Illinois Central Rail-
way Co. did him positive harln. And
so have many other remarks or his.

Itls extremely unfortunate. If
Gov. Lanollette is to become a real
leader in the nation he must become
moredlscreet and more conservative
in his expressed opinions.”

We received this week another of
the Iowa papers edited by young men
who were formerly Iowa College
students and in whom, for than-ea-
son, Grinnell people have an especial
interest. The paper We refer to is
the Riceville Recorder, edited by
EarlSt. John, a well known student
here about eight years ago, He is the
son of H0n.R.T.St. John, for years one
of the strongest members of the Iowa
legislature and also state commander
of the G. A. R. The Recorder has
the reputation or being one oi the
brightest and best edited papers of
northeastern Iowa and we are glad to
add it to the "Iowa College Colony”
among our exchangesiﬂeruld.
