Men’s and women's organizations at
Oregon will give only one dance in
the three terms oi: school this year,

faculty social affairs committee. The
class and student body ﬂanges will be
held as usual. although there is a pos-
sihiliiy that there will be ’more or the
latter this year than fomerly.

Grinnell women students should'con—
slder themselves lucky when they take
into consideration that at Oberlin Col-
lege n‘nderclass women must he in at
