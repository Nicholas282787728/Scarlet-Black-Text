sity conch. announced yesterday.

Drake should have a compartive
ly easy time in winning the meet.
Duke stated yesterday. They have
fairly good all around strength,
he said, and it is not likely that
the other teams Will break up
their points, as other Conference
schools who will score are all in
events in which Drake does not
score anyway.

Pluneers May Finish High

The Pioneers, however. Will not
finish last in the meet. Duke be»
lieves, As has been the case in
the last few meets. they will score
most of their points in the middle
distances, he asserted. Barnes.
Hess. and Bentley are fairly sureY
to pick up more than one place
in the 440-yd. dash, and it is
fairly certain that Lynn Schlotter-
beck. who won the half mile event
against both Iowa and Drake will
win, that event in the conference,
affair.

l-iis majar opposition. Duke de~
cured will come from Romine 0f
dklahoms. who won third in the
half mile in the conference indoor
meet last year. in addition. if

Final figures on the drive to see

China, which ended today, total
$382,052. according to Clinton
Hehiing, '39. student treasurer of
the drive. This surpasses by bet-
ter than 30 dollars the goal of 300

ginning of the campaign.

The final figures show an in-
crease of $54.09 over the total i-c-
ported in last Saturday's issue of
the Scarlet and Black. This last
increase was due to increases in
the amounts pledged by the fac-
ulty, and additional contributions
secured in Rawson, Mears. and
Langan. Also reports were se-
cured from Smith, Macy and the
town men for the first time.

Frances Mussey and Richard

chairman. declared that they were
