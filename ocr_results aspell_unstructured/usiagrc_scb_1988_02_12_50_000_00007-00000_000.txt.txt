Opinion

We Must Fight to Retain Liberty

in an earlier column. i wrote
about my iear oi the trend “in the
populace to experiment with the
barrier between church and state.
While clerical presidents, school
prayer. secularist book burnings,
creches on courthouse lawns, etc,
each remove only a single brick in
this proverbial wall. the iramers oi
the Constitution built the wan solid

John

Newmark.

ior a purpose: Even the smallest oi'

holes are big enough tor some
things to crawl through, and once
trails have been broken. history
tells us. the trails turn into roads.
These roads turn into highways. in

- order to perpetuate this
nation...we must make sure every

~ last brick contained in the wall
separating church and state res
mains iirm and intact.”

There also appears to be a trend
to question the boundaries oi the
First Amendment. in the Supreme
Court decision against the
l-iazelwood East High School
newspaper, we learned that it
something “bears the
imprimatur" oi the school, the
principal or school board can
decide whether it iollows “the
educational mission" oi the school
and remove it. Within the two
weeks that iollowed the decision.
one lowa City high-school principal
decided to exercise the power. A
student wrote an editorial on “cons
servative. ignorant, narroWr
minded thinking." iocusing.

ironically, on the Hazelwood case.
The principal ielt that the editorial
was tine. However. a neighboring
editorial cartoon disagreed with
him. it contained a commercially-
produced picture oi a monkey and
a banana. The caption read,
“President Reagan at work seleCr
ting the next chiei justice ior uie
Supreme Court." Equating
Reagan and a monkey didn't ap-
peal to the principal, so he blacked
out the caption.

Some people argue that there is
nothing technically unconstitur
tional with the Supreme Court
decision or the lowa City
.principal's action. The editor oi
any newspaper has the right to
decide which articles will be
printed and which ones won‘t. The
First Amendment iorbids govern
mental censorship, not editorial
censorship,

However, while the two cases
don't violate the strict letter oi the
Constitution. they do violate its
spirit, in each case, the principal
was acting like Big Brother and
was deciding what his students
should or should not think While
thought control might be legal by
the strict letter oi the law, it goes
against the very spiritual founda~
tions oi the First Amendment. For
the same reasons that one argues
censorship or school newspapers is
constitutional. one can argue that
book burnings by a school district
is constitutional School textbooks
certainly “bear the imprimatur”
oi the school. so the Hazelwood
decision could be construed to in-
cludc even the burning oi books.

git doesn't matter whether the

books are being burned by the
government or by the schools. The
result is still the same. Our
nation's children are being told
what they are allowed to think
about and what they are not.
Hazelwood was telling its students
not to think about divorce or teen
age pregnancy, Perhaps it they
never hear about it. the problems
will go away. The lowa City high
school was telling its students
never to compare a public official
with a monkey. One school was
telling its students not to think
about controversial issues; the
other was telling its students not to
criticize authority, They are both
attempting to breed a scared, obe-
dient, and servile generation.

it these actions oi censorship
cannot be stopped by the Constitur
tion. then the only route leit open is
for those affected to protest the ac-
tion. lta principal removes an arti-
cle irom the 'newspaper, the
students and community should set
up a picket line until the article is
returned. In a situation of a com-
munity against a principal, the
principal must always give in,
since it is the community which
supports the school. what our na-
tion can not aiiord to be is
apathetic, it we allow other people
to impose their belieis upon others.
or ii we allow people to commit
moral outrages such as censorr
ship, we are only encouraging
others to iollow them. As Thomas
Jefferson once said, ‘The price of
freedom is eternal vigilance." if
we don't continue to tight, we will
lose our liberty.

,On Second Thought

it used to amuse me to see people
strike up patriotic poses, or try to
bring in God as emotional support
when they were trying to sell me
something. it seemed like such an
obvious ploy that no one could iall
ior it. Oh, how wrong I was
patriotism and religion are on the
rise. and no matter how silly it
may seem they will be used to sell

you anything irom entertainment
to politicians.

One oi the more outrageous
things I’ve heard in the past iew
years was that Oral Roberts saw a
nib-toot tall Jesus in bare ieet, and
people believed him. Apparently
the big. bearded iellow was walke
ing around in Roberts'
neighborhood, bringing a message
irom God tor maybe an F'rb bou-
quetl. Uniortunately, no one else
saw him or his iootprints. But this
didn’t hurt Rbberts' credibility.
Last spring he told iolks that God
had given him an ultimatum:
unless he came up with some BIG
CASH, the Lord would do him in.
And much to my surprise, peeple
coughed it up, to the tune oi more
than to million. People are buying
him and his connection with God

At the time, i was disgusted that
Robers could dupe people out oi so
much money, particularly since
most oi his supporters are elderly.
But i wasn't really worried about
action on a national political scale.

or anything which might directly
affect me,

But now Pat Robertson has God
as a campaign consultant. and pear
pie are voting for him

Who can knock God? who can
accuse you oi stooping to accept
divine advice? Sure, people may
write Fat on as a zealot, but who is
going to stand up in front oi the
cameras and tell him has full of
the brown stuif? who‘s going to
call his bluff? ”You aren't in touch
with God,” cries an anguished
voice. “He told me you were just in
this ior your ego!” .

“I'm sure you were mistaken.
brother," chides Mr. Pat, “Are you
sure that was His voice you were
listening to?”

Mr. Pat is not alone. He came in
second oi the Republican can-
didates in the caucus, behind a
man who invokes another force to
back up his political position: nae
tionalism. People are buying that,
too.

But even Dole isn't as blatant in .

his appeal to patriotism as some or
the Democrats. Gephardt disturbs
me iar more. He appeals to the coir
lective arrogance of many
Americans, who. though not
noteworthy or eiiicacious oi their
own right, enjoy watching
America bully less poweriul nar
tions abroad Might makes right.
Dick? You go "tell OPEC where to
go,"

For some reason. people think
that there's a difference between
making a nation weaker than
yours grove] and making a person
weaker than you grove]. Because

of our power and arrogance, we
think we have a right to kick people
around. By creating images oi our
nation as somehow intrinsically
better than others, we preclude the
options which result when we treat
other nations as equals. By pain-
ting America while and the Soviet
Union black. we iorego
possibilities resulting irom mutual
understanding and cooperation in
the iuture. Simply, by taking the
stance of absolute moral justifica-
tion, we ilush many oi our iuture
ioreign policy options down the
porcelain bowl,

As soon as we appeal to
patriotism above the law, we're in
{or a rough ride. Remember a cerr
tain Senator McCarthy? He was
protecting the Constitution by
violating it.

Where else does buying this nae
tionalism lead'! Ask jolly Ollie
North. He thought it was fine to lie
and steal; he was doing it tor
America. and the ends justified the
means.

But don't get me wrong, I think
patriotism is great. The love of
one's country ior its good qualities
and the desire to further it in living
up to the dream oi its iounders is a
powerful force. But in order to do
this. it is necessary that we see our
weaknesses as well as our
strengths. so that we can see the
areas which still need improve»
menl Anyone who sees the faults
oi our society will be hardrpressed
to come up with a valid argument
tor why ours is morally better than
others'.

Where I see the danger is in in-

 

Echo From
the Darkside

by Ron Leinen

0n the evening or Dec. 29, i had
the good iortune to be arrested —
in the comfort of my own home,
That event and its subsequent side
eiiects have yanked my eyes open
to an ugly aspect oi American
society that I knew existed, but did
not realize was so ierocious, In the
course oi my arrest, a number oi
rights that I had always believed to
be protected by the United States
Constitution were violated. I wish
to convey this unsavory story
because I believe it raises serious
quesmns as to the nature oi law on
iorcement in this country,
Although my case is minor enough
that I find some aspects of it so ab-
surd as to be hilarious, il
ioreboding implications are no
laughing matter.

Here is a brief account of the
BUST:

My parents were out oi town. sol
thought it a good opportunity to me
vite several iriends over, approx
imately 10 people. The actual
crime consisted of our ingestion or
Schlitz Light, while we were se. ted
in the living room watching Di vid
Letterman. This was deiinitely ioi
a raucous free-forrall, or eve a
party. by any stretch oi the m-
agination, No one stumb Cd
aimlessly about the house in an
alcoholic fog or wandered outs dc
to terrorize neighborhood pets. 1 he
breathalizcr test later forced on us
indicated that everyone was well
below the .1 level of intoxicatit i\.
and several people were comple e-
ly sober.

The reason the police came to

voking either God or Countr/ in
lieu or a sound policy, an. in
disregard of either constitutional
or international law. People
become so hypedeup about the
rightness oi what they are doing
that they lose their objectivity and
their sense. Remember reading
about World War I? The gthr

mcnts had to get their societies in
to a patriotic irenzy in order fu'
them to accept the necess.try
austerity measures. The result?
No peace could be agreed upon , c
cept unconditional surrender, 1 re
cost'! At least eight million live:

Too many people are willing to
sell themselves as agents or God or
patriotism, and the result is that
we think in dichotomies, By taking
a “moral” position, we are settiig
ourselves up tor the use oi double
standards.

Remember Iran? A iew phrases
come to mind. such as “Go to the
Middle East, and help an lranian
meet Allah." “Bomb, Bomb.
Bomb, Bomb. Bomb Iran,” and
“FW with the best, die like the
rest." Many people thought that
we would be justified in killing lra-
nian civilians in retaliation for a
“terrorist" act. They iorgot that
killing civilians is wrong, and that
we assassinated the government
before the Shah and put him in
power They also nearly overlook-
ed the fact that his civtl»rights
record and treatment of his sub
jects were poor at best; thus the
rise oi a popular charismatic
leader, the Ayatollah Had we not

the house was unrelated to any
supposed debauchery,
Unbeknownst to me, a young
woman at the house had had an
argument with her parents that
afternoon, and they had filed a
missingrpersons report with the
police. As part oi that report. the
parents had iniormed the police
where their daughter was. Makes
sense in a demented sort oi way.

'i he police were somewhat
courteous. At least they knocked I
opened the door and tour oiiicers
stomped into the house, including
two with guns tthe worst kind).
Aftor demanding to know if the
youtig woman in question was in
the house, the head officer imr
mediately stated that they had pro-
bable cause to enter. Apparently
the oiiicers had been sneaking
around outside, peeping in the win

MS.

I did not invite the officers into
Ute house, as the head officer has
s.nce testiiied. On the contrary. I
axked the officers several times if
tney were authorized to act in this
l.anner. i also attempted on at
l Ist two occasions to take the
ht-ad officer aside so that he could
e> plain the situation to me.
Eieryone in the living room
witnessed my inquiries.

Everyone was placed under ar-
rest, Each person was irisked,
searched. handcuffed and taken in
the station. A Search of the entire
house was conducted after we were
in custody-The oiiicers had no
search warrant They didn't iind
anything, except someone sleeping
upstairs. He was arrested, too.

Upon arriving at the station. I
was left in a garage, and remained
handcuffed for over 45 minutes.
Fortyiive long minutes, leit to
stew in confusion and dread. After
i was uncuiied and read my rights,
i spent the next eight hours lying
on a hallway iloor with tour oi my
c-mpatriots, unable to post the
, no cash ball. 1 was iinally sprung

7ortunately ior us, the daughter
oi the most iniluential lawyer in
[own was Involved in this mess,
i-ltr iather recognized the obvious
ab lses that had occurred. and ens
"ouraged us to fight the matter In
cot rt. This was made possible
betause his associate agreed to
represent us at a greatly reduced
ram. It was later worked out that I
\iould stand trial individually, and
my iate would determine that oi
the others.

i awaited my initial hearing
eager both to vindicate my besmlr~
chL‘C name and to learn about the
American judicial system, As soon
as I entered the courtroom, I
realized that things might not go so
smoothly. A calendar ieaturing a
.iielike drawing or John Wayne‘s
head hung upon the wall, with this
caption in bold print: “It's like i
told ya' pilgrim.,,CRiME DON’T
PAY!" The top part. of the calen-
dar boasted a photograph oi the
police-department employees
decked out in all their glory. scowl-
ing sourly at the camera.

I quickly learned that the cour-
troom is not a forum for the coins

his or her innocence, but rather an
arena ior astronomicaily salaried
lawyers to intellectually duel. Unr
fortunately, the mental sparring in

triguing. The judge spent most oi
