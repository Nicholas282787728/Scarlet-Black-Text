SCARLET AnDiBLAct; is pleased
to note the joint meeting which is
to be held by the four college lit-
crary societies on next Saturday
evening; the ladies' socicties tur-
nishing the literary program while
the gentlemen provide the de-
bate. This is a step in the right
direction. It has been at least
two years- since any such meeting
has been held, although no one
candeny that these joint sessions
of the different societies have an
excellent effect in arousing inlerr
estalong literary lilies. It society
\vorlt ever needed a stimulus it is
now and we are glad to note the
ettorts which are being made to
arouse ﬂagging enthusiasm and
bring new members, and conse-
quently new life, into the socie-
ties. The meeting Saturday night
will be held in the chapel and Will
be open to everyone who desires
to attend. It is hoped that maiiy
who are not yet identﬁed with arty
society will be present in order to
see the quality of the tt-oik which
is being done in the society halls
this year.

rely on God. It is at the time
when our characters are being
moulded, hereditary
stincts are at their height. when
the whole being is overﬂowing
tvitli lite and energy. that divine
help is needed. more than at any
other, The address of the eveiir
ing on the subject, “Friendship
with God," was hardly icss im-
pl‘essive. The main thought was
that the true Christian is not the
servant ot God. obcyingand work-
ing from a sense of obligation, as
a servant tor a master, but that lie
is a lriend in all that the ivord im-
plies, doing the work or God be
cause he loves it, and enjoying the
perlect conﬁdence and trust in
God which only true triends can
have in one another. All the other
meetings of the day were earnest
and helpiul, and it is certain that
the Day ot Prayer will have a bene-
noial ertcct upon many. It IE only
right that one day in the busy
college year should be devoted
exclusively to serious religious
thought. The inﬂuence of such a
day is great upon all who use it
rightly, and it seems hardly possi-
ble that any one can have attend
ed the services of last Sunday
without receiving some beneﬁt
from them.
