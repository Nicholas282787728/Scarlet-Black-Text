Siuden‘ls oi
Hamp’ron Feel
At Home Here

By John Durham

It’s a long way from Virginia
to lowa, and Wyvetter Hoover
and Andrew Billingsley, who
made the trip recently, can tell
you that there’s a great differ-
ence in temperatures between
the two places.

“I’m not complaining about
Iowa weather," Andrew says,
“but a forty degree rise in tem-
perature wouldn’t hurt any—

Wyvetter shivers com.
plete assent.

Both Wyvettel- and Andrew,
here from Hampton institute on
the Hampton-Grinnell student
exchange, are glad they made
the trip despite the weather. “I
feel like i belong," Andrew, or
Andy, as he would prefer to be
called, says. “The friendliness
and general atmosphere of fra-
ternity has impressed me very
much. The students and my in-
structors have made me feel at
home."

Wyvetter is quick to agree:
"Grinnell has a friendly. whole.
some air. I like the community
living, and I like my courses.
The separation of boys and girls
at basketball games and in class-
es surprised me, though."

Andy, a sophomore accounting
major from Birmingham, Ala.,
and a veteran of the European
and Pacific war theatres, came
to Grinnell mainly because he
approves thoroughly of the idea;
behind the exchange plan. This,[
the first plan whereby Northern:
colleges and Southern Negro in-
stitutions of higher learning ex
change students on a reciprocal‘
basis, was inaugurated between
Hampton institute and Grinnell
three years ago.

"The two»sided prejudice that,
exists in the South, and in the‘
North, too, must be broken
down,” Andy says, “and under
standing is necessary before this
can be done. This exchange is
a move toward inter—racial un ,
derstanding at the level where
least resistance is met. I think
it's good and I'd like to. see it

hibiting paintings in the Seven-
teenth Annual Six States Exhibi-
tion in Omaha.

A fund for DP’S, a popular~
music concert, and a name—band
Gadabouts dance will share the
$3000 social fee kickback, ac-
cording to results of the Student
Council sponsored balloting,

Voting for three of six possi-
bilities, 700 students marked
their ballots, and of this num-
ber 490 supported the fund for
DP’s, 350 the popular concert,
and 350 a GadabouLs name band
dance. The remaining three pos-
sibilities were 255 to allocate a
third of the funds to pay the
student Share of the Women's
gym canopY. 252 for a play from
KENT, and 162 to return a share
to the halls.

Because of the plurality in fa-
vor the DP fund (to help meet
expenses involved in transport—
ing, feeding, and housing four
DP's in addition to the two al»
ready enrolled), the social\cal-
endar and student social coordin-
ating committees moved to allo-
cate to that fund any residue
from the other two.

Other suggestions from stu—
dents, filed for Council reference
in the event of other kickbacks,
included allocating funds for
CARE. Uncle Sam’s club, the
Hampton echange program, and
the March of Dimes and other
charitable programs,

The write»in suggestions, plan—
ned at Tuesday nights’ mass
meeting, favored building addi-
tional recreation room or pre-
paring Darby dungeon as a fee
room. For the first, funds are
inadequate; for the second, the
space has been given to Coach
rfitsch for a locker room.

Pioneer ,Tdnlters
Sink 'Knox Team
In Easy Viciory

Completely outclassed, a visit-
ing Knox swimming team was
soundly (trounced Saturday by
the Grinnell tank team. Garner-
ing first place honors in all
eight events, the Pioneers swept
to an easy 55.19 victory over
the hapless men from Galosburg.

In his first meet since return-
ing to school, Bob Noyce showed
promise of regaining his form of
last year as he walked off with
the diving honors for the day.
Ably supported by “Skip” King-
ery, the two should prove val-
uable to the swim team’s hopes
of continuing their successful
ways. '

Highlights in the meet were
all on the Grinnell side of the
ledger. Reid "Doc” Neilson's
driving finish in the 200 yard
breast stroke and Bob Zeltler's
time of 58:9 in the 100 yard
free style were pleasing to Coach
Slaughter.

in the 300 yard medley, Stan
l—lall, Tom Rigler, and Sid Legg
broke the pool record and serv~
ed notice they will be hard to
beat in the future.

All in all, Coach Slaughter was
satisfied with the team_ showingl
