Drag Committee
Plans to Award
Ticket to Derby

A free ticket to the Brown Derby
Drag, which will be held at the men's
gym next Saturday night, May 5,
viii be given at the College Shop on
Friday morning at 11-17. Particulars
regarding the plan are being withheld
until that time, but it has been sug-
gested by members of the committee
in charge, that in order to become
eligible for the free ticket it will he
necessary to bring one that has al-
ready been purchased,

Reccnt announcements tend to
show that the 1934 Brown Derby
Drag, presented annually by the Sig-
ma Delta Chi, Grinnell journalistic
fraternity. will be even more elabor-
ate and popular than Derby Drags of
the past.

At the present time a committee
is working to secure late permission
for that night, and there is also a
possibility that the affair will be
started earlier than most dances‘on
the campus.

Several publicity stunts are being
planned for the track meet Saturday
and for chapel periods during the re-
mainder of the week, but they are be-
ing withheld so that the surprise clc-
ment may add to their merits. James
Gallagher, chairman iii charge of
ticket sales, announced today that
the “tickets were selling like hot-
cakes." It s planned to limit the
number of tickets, and it is probable
that only 150 couples will be admitted
to the dance.

Abe Roscnhloom will act as master
of ceremonies, and will present the
various awards,

Charlie Agnew and his famous
broadcasting dance hand will furnish
the music, while one of his biggest
attractions will be the singing of
Emory Ann Lincoln, who has earned
a national reputation as a popular
songstress

Four Conference Teams Win
Total of 32 Points

Butler flash, Rey Sears, Joe Phciffcr
placed second in thc two-mile run at
the Drake Relays Saturday Plieiffer
was the only Gi'illncll representative
to score, although
team placed fourth in its trial heat
which was the fastest of the prelim-
inary heats in that event.

The Missouri Valley conference
schools were led in scoring by Okla-
homa A. a M. which scored eleven
points, taking third in the too-yard
relay, second in the broad jump,
third in the discus and third in the
javelin throw

Drake and Butler were practically|

tied for second place in scoring hon-
ors among the Valley schools. Drake
won second place by a third of a
point, scoring a total of nine and
third points to Butler's oven nine.
Drake's points were gained by tak-

Hoyt, ’18, Now Michigan Track Coach,

Still Holds Two Interscholastic Marks,

Records Set 20 Years Ago
At Grinnell Meet
Yet Unbroken

Digging through the files of The
Scarlet and Black for the years 1916-
17, it was found that practically all
of the papers feature the famous
Charles Hoyt, who graduated from
here in the latter year, and who is
now track coach at the University of
Michigan.

It became almost amusing to
note the huge banners that were
spread across the entire page, such
as ”Hoyt wins the 100 and 220 at the
State Meet" and ”Hoyt crashes
through for new record."

In the annual Iowa conference
mcct held at Grinnell iir 1917, Grin-
ncll track mcn won the meet tak-
mg 50 points, 20 points ahead of the
second best team, Coe college. In
this meet Hoyt won the low hurdles
in 24,5, which at that time was one
better than the meet record, The
Scarlet and Black commcntcd, “Grin-
nellians can never forget the grin
that spread over ‘Chuclt' Hoyt's face

 

as he finished the low hurdles ahead
of Massey of Coo, a. second faster
than the state record."

It has probably been noticed that
Hoyt holds two records in the Grin-
nell Interscholastic track and field
meet which will be held here next
Saturday, At that time he was com-
peting for the Greenfield high school,
and ran the century in 9.8 seconds
and the 220-yard dash in 21.8. Nel~
ther of these marks have been
touched since this time

In 1916 Hoyt shared the state 100-
yard dash record with “Speed '
Rush, also a Grinnell alumni, and
held the record in the 220 undisputed.

Hoyt really had his great yeftr in
1.916. On Saturday, May 20, 1916 The
Scarlet and Black burst forth with
the startling headline, “Hoyt Equals
World's Rccord in State Meet at Dos
Moincs.” His time for this race was
9.5 seconds. In this same meet he
won the 220 in time that broke the
state record.

The following excerpt is taken from
that paper:

”Hoyt is the only real sprintin-
Grilmell has ever known, is a state-
ment recently made by Doc Huff,
conch, concerning the phenomenal
