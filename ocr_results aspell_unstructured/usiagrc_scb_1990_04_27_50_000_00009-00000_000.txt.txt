Student Attacks S&B
Coverage, Courtesy

To the editor.

I am writing to express my
disappointment in this paper. Two
weeks ago I sent a mail message to
the paper asking if they would be
interested in writing an article on
the band I am in. that would be
playing on campus soon (April
25th). To this letter I got no
response. I later asked the editor if
the paper had received my letter
and was told that they had and it had
been referred to the ans editor, and

that they wanted to do an articleiif‘

they had space. .

That was the last I heard from
the Scarlet and Black until last
Sunday (the 15th) when I asked
another member of the staff if he'd
heard anything. He replied that he
had, but wasn’t sure if they were

doing anything or not. I am not so
much disappointed that there was

'no article as that I never heard

anything from the paper. I do feel
that performances on campus by
students are important and should
take preference over some of the
articles that were in last week’s
edition, but understand that there
are limitations of space. I feel,
however, that wecould at least have
been added to the campus events
calender. Itis terriblydisappointin g
that the paper does not consider a
conceri as newsworthy'as former
deans and editorial cartoons. It is
also disappointing that the staff of
the STUDENT paper considers
themselves above the common
courtesy of even responding to my
letter.

"Distatsteful" Music
Inconsiderate to Listeners

To the editor,

Monday afternoon at about 4
pm, as I was sitting in my room
with the window open, I was
accosted by the sound of particularly
distasteful music being blasted out
ofsomeone else’s room for the rest
of South Campus to hear. This
particular song consisted of a
monotonous rhythm, a computer-
programmcd and equally boring
tunc,andaboutthreeorfourminuies
of a woman moaning in the
supposed throes of passion.

I feel thatany human being who
knows passion and has cxpcrianccd
the very personal bond of love,
wouldcertainlyfindanothermeans
of expressing their awe for such an
inimateact. The use of lhiswoman's
faked ecstacy demeans the true
exhilaration a woman is capable of,

while it ignores any passion a man
might also feel by not including
equally staged gnmts on his part.
(What is this supposed toexplain to
usaboutthe roleof women and men
as partners in intimacy?)

I would go so far as to intuit that
the writer of this piece shares very
little of my opinion, especially the
respect that I hold for love, lovers,
and women in general.

I personally have no objection
to the sound a womanly exultation,
but I am seriously offended by the
lackadasical use of pseudorscx in
any public form. This is why I
don'twatch pomos,read skin-mags,
or listen to music such as thisiand
Iwould prefer not to be forccd to do
so.

Killion Answers Ward's
Allegations of Misconduct

To the editor,

I write in response to Dianna
Ward‘s letter of last Week.

Iam confused. Idon‘t understand
why Dianna Ward has blamed me
for what she perceives as
inadequacies in theelection process.
I neither ran the election, chaired
Election Board, nor gave Election
Board any orders throughout the
election process (contrary to her
ludicrous accusation that I gave
Election Board voting instructions
regarding Scott'l‘niesdell'sappeal).
Perhaps if Dianna had taken the
time to discover those facts, she
would have spared me her unfair,
uninformed, exclamation point-
riddcn slurs. Butthcn again,perhaps
Diannadoesn't find the truth nearly
as interesting as the assumption that
fraudandconspiracyhaveoccnrred.

As far as Dianna‘s specific
allegationd about the election are
concerned. she is more than
welcome to ask Election Board to
meet and hear her concerns. The
campus should know, though, that
the reason Election Board didn't
makeScott's complaintsandappcal
ppublic initially was because Scott
himself insisted mat they not. He
made Election Board agree to keep
the meeting entirely conﬁdential.
Scott then proceeded to tell anyone
who would listen how unfairly he
had been treated in the whole
process, knowing full well he had
denied Election Board member the
ability to defend themselves because
they were bound by
"confidentiality." Scotthasnothing
to be ashamed of in losing such a
close election. But he has
everything to be ashamed of in his
unethical conduclaftcrthcclcction.

Six weeks after the
election ended and fourwccks after
Election Board did not grantScotta
new election, I thinktl's finally time

Pro-Life Group Urges Consideration
for Fair Campus Abortion Debate

To the editor,

As a member of the Grinneli
College Student ProrLife Organi-
zation, it has been brought to my
attention thatvarious pamphlets and
other“litcrature”haverecentlybccn
distributed by provchoice activists
to the student body which contain,
among other things, fallacious rep-
resentations of generally perceived
“ProLifc” arguments. Although
these “straw man" positions cer-
tainly make for more effective “lit-
crature," we as an organization do

not feel that the presentation of
such artificially weakened caricaa
tures of arguments facilitates intel-
ligent, informed discussion of the
very important issue of abortion.
We, the Pro-Life students of
GrinneliCollege,askthatourargu-
merits be granted equal allenlion,as
your ”literature” does not fairly
represent our position. On a cam-
pus such as Grinnell, I would hope
that the issue of abortion can be
calmly and logically discussed
without any further such hindrance
of informed discussion. To clarify

our ProvLife beliefs and provoke
yourthoughton thiscomplexissue,
the Grinneli College ProvLife Stu-
dent Organization will bcdistribut»
ing its own publication in the near
future. We ask that you grant our
arguments your attention, as it has
been too long that Pro-Life beliefs
have been virtually extinguished in
the in the “free exchange" of ideas
at Grinneli College.

Grinneli College Student
Pro-Life Organization

for Scott to make a decision. If he
feels the election was flawed or that
he was treated unfairly, he should
appeal the outcometo tudCo (as
Election Board told him he could
do almost a full month ago). He
should also allow Election Board
members to speak freely aboutwhat

happened in his appeal hearing. If
he doesn't have any legitimate
complaints about the election
process, he should let the matter
drop, and letDianna move on to her
next cause.

To the editor.

Mike Worobcc’s letter in the
Scarlet and Black, regarding the
Gates Hall “Chemoball,” made a
valid point about the lack of con-
sideration taken in choosing the
party’s theme; however, much was
left unsaid. We realize that steps
were taken by the party's coordi-
nators to offer an explanation for
this choice. The use of the “Cher-
noball" theme, as explained in a
letter to the Sovietstudents, was a
mere play on words, the best way
of incorporating a trend in neon
clothing. The intent of the letter
was not to gain approval from the
Soviet students, but tojustify the
choice of“Chemoball."

The purpose ofany ztllrcztmpus
party is to include all Grinneli
students. Yet many students, of
both Soviet and other nationali-
ties,choscnotto attend the“Chcr-
noball," as they were offended.
With the letter, it appears that

To the editor,

Few occurrences cry out for
reply as does the Gale’s Chemoa
ball, and yet a striking lack of
written response has been ob-
served. We appreciate and heart
ily agree with the sentiments
expressed in theletter and cartoon
of the April 20 Scarlet andElack.
We feel, however, that we need to
add our droughts, as well.

Would we work the word
“Challenger" into the title of a
college party? We think not.
Would we celebrate in the name
of Dachau? We think not. Is it
because there isn't a clever pun
ready at hand to convert the seri-
ous nature of these events into the
happy farce ofa party? Doubtful.
Why then, have many on this
campus—ct campus which sup
posedlyprides itselfon thecthical

 

Death and Nuclear
Destruction Not Proper
for Gates' Party Theme

Gates Hall recognized the potch
tial for hurting some people; at
that point they could easily have
picked another theme without the
hurtful connotations.

Next week marks the four-
yearanniversaryoftheChemobyl
disaster, and people are still ex-
periencingitsdevastatingeffects,
As Grinneli students, supposedly
culturally sensitive, we should
realize that when destruction
occurs far away, the feelings of
those directly affected are no less
valid thenourown wouldbeundcr
similarcircumslances. A tragedy
brought about by human “prog-
ress" is certainly no cause for
celebration. We should, instead,
conccm ourselves With the all-
too real and constant threat of
future uagedy,thatwcfaceliving
in a nuclear age.

Title "Offended, Shocked,
and Hurt" Soviet Guests

and political correctness of it’s
students4hoosc to party clothed
in the colors symbolic of a most
horrifying trztgedy‘.7 Are they so
callousandunthoughtful thatthey
could deny the feelingsofan entire
nation, and more specifically,
those of eight visiting students'.7

We hope that none of those
who participated in this event
honestly believe that adding dis-
claimers lo the promotional post-
ers or writing a note to the Soviet
studean (explaining how the witty
use of Chemoble was discovered
and then immonalized in T-shirt
and poster before the realization
of the error) could in any way
soften the cold, hard fact that we
have offended, shocked, and hurt
our Soviet guests.
