Railsback In

Last Season,

With Team He Calls Tops

by Hull Pothoven

“We’re not a team yet but
We'll jell lby the Carleton game".
is what six-foot senior guard
Tom Railsback says of this
year's varsity cagers. “hails", in
his last semester of competition
for Grinnell, is looking forward
to a successful campaign.

When asked how he thought
the Pioneers wlauld stack up
against their loop foes this year
he repiled, “We will be fighting
for the title all the way and
should get it.”

Holder of two basketball
and two golf letters, Tom will
be on the squad for only half
of its 13 games this year be.
cause of a semester‘s competi-
tion at Molino Junior college.
Coach Pfiuéh labeled Tom as

the best long shot on the team

‘but added that he is too‘ intxmr
sisent. Last year he was the top

man on the squad and was es-
pecially useful when the 0p-

panents began pulling their de-
fense in to tie up Bob Winter.
in instances such as these,

“Rails" was the one called on

to loosen up the defense with

his deadly ,pokes from out. His
average of 6.1 points per game
was sixth highest rm the squad,

He attributes his interest in

basketball to his older brother,
Fritz, who played for. Grin-nell
during the 1939-40 season While
tagging after his brother to all
his games, Tom decided that
this was the sport for him. He
says that this squad is the type
of team that a fellow really
likes to play ball with.

[Him]: says that Tom‘s

make him a real asset to the
team His quickwitand cool-
ness help to relieve the press
sure in important moments of
the game.

Grinnell will really missl
“Rails” when his eligibility runs‘
out in January. Right now one
of Pfitsch's main problems is 00
find someone to replace this
veteran, who started against
Central and‘ will be on the first:

an and Dave Norris too-captains
of next season's Pioneer grid
squad. Ryan, left half-back on
this year's team, gained a total

rig'ht lhalf last year, but this
year was switched to the oppo-
site slot. This season Ryan scor-
ed six Grinnell touchdowns for
the record books, while five
