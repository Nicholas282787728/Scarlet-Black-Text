With a differingwiew. Gene Wubbels.
Professor oi Chemistry and a member or
the Library and Bookstore Committee
stated that the estimated $30.000 spent on
an electronic security system could buy a

would be iar less expensive and possibly
more efficient to attack the problem by
raising peoples' consciousness toward
moral responsibi ty. Wubbels
said.“330,000 is not a trivial cost" and he
would “like to concentrate on improving
Grinnell's sense of Community and ethics
