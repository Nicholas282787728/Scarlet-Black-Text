Students improvise ELL tutoring methods

Tutoring, cont. from p. 5
tute books out of photos of the student, the school
and the student’s teacher so that students can read
something “that has meuning for them."

In addition to homemade materials, all ofthe tuv
tors have access to a picture dictionary, which Hakim
snid is very helphtl.“The good thing
about the picture dictionary is that
we can build on what Daniela has
been lenrning in each session and

the past," she said. "It also comes
with a workbook which also helps
so she can learn how to write the
words she's learning."

Henry Reich ’09 works with
Jerry, a thirdrgmdet, for two hours
each week. Reich uses both English and Spanish to
teach agesuppropriare skills such as addition otlerge
numbers and placesholding. "I think Jerry should
be learning everything in context," he said. “Notjust

learning English by looking at pictures."

Rosenow suid that a student’s progression depends
on whether he or she was able to read and write in anv
other language, their williness to learn and how much
cmphasais the smdenr’s family places on education.

Sometimes everyone, including teachers, are un
aware ofa student's true language ability:

“There are some kids who’ve
been in the United States for
three years. They know convcrs
sutionnl English quite well but
when it gets in to academic sub
jects they have trouble," Rosenow
Said. “Teachers say, ‘Oh, he knows
English,'but then when (he stun
dents gets in science they’ve never
heard those words.”

Hakim said that Daniela is a fast learner and picks
up on vocabulary quickly, and while she is shy around
Engﬂshrspeakets, once Hakim started talking to her

in Spanish, she was very outgoing.

Susan Hildebrand '08 also tutors Jerry “He's in
a classroom most of the day listening to a language
he doesn't understand and I walk into the classroom
nnd say‘Hola,icomo estésP’and he just Lights up,"she
said.

Amy Graves, Community Service Center coordis
nator, said that there are many requests for oppotmnit
ties to speak Spanish. According to Graves, students
returning from abroad want to use their new language
skills,and srudenrs seeking posrsgrad ESL jobs desire
teaching experience, she said.

Kugisaki said she enjoys using Spanish and it
helps her connect with Dnuieln.

“I’m surprised at how much comes our of my
mouth," she said. “Daniela kind of giggles when I
mess up and it encourages me to stick with it."

Hildebrand said she has gained more than just
teaching experience.

“It is not just me teaching a language,” she said.
“I learn a lot about culture and I think people forget
