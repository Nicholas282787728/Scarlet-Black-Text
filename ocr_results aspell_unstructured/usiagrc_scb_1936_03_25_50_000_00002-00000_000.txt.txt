braitli) was meant to he the Sopli.
isticated Young Lady. but her
character does not quite emerge,
possibly because she is given thc
difficult assignment of being so~
pnisticated in the north woods
without cocktails or cigarettes.

Lines Important.

What these characters say is
more important than they them-
selves; and Monday night’s aud-
ience must have delighted Mr.
Davidson, (who at length consent-
ed to how in response to cries of
"Author! Author:") by laughing
appreciatively at the many right
places, and by breaking for oncc
the Grinnell tradition of meager,
self-conscious applause.

The actors play their roles with
spirit, although there is a tenden-
cy, especially on the part of Mr.
Spies, to mouth lines into an in»
audibility they do not at all de-
serve. Miss Houston gives new
proof of her versatility, but it
would perhaps have been wiser to
let the audience take the excels
lence of her tap dancing on trust.

Acting Improves,

Both William Callaway (in the:
part of Patrick Jones. a combina-
tion aviator and herpetologist) and
Mr. Kirk have improved vastly
since their appearance 13 months
ago in "Hay Fever." Miss sinex
pouts and sullrs realistically. but
in the speech about Lolita’s past
life proves herself capable of bet-
ter things, even raising the char-,
actor for a moment into sharp(
reality.

The direction is in the hands of
Mrs, Sara. Sherman Pryor, who
must be held responsible for the
smoothness of the production, The
admit timing, so essential to good
farce, was particularly noticeable
in the breakfast scene in act one.
and iii the scene between Miss
Houston and Mr. Spies in the last
act.
