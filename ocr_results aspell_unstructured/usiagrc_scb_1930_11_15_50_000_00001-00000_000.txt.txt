Brundidge Delivers Address

tie Brundx'dgc cadres has bean copyrcad
and edited.)

By ALLEN COOPER
(Short of The Rail Splitter)

“Chicago gangsters kill only their
own kind, and an outsider is safe,"
declared Harry T. Brundidge of the
St. Louis Star, while telling of his ad—
ventures during the Alfred “Jake"
Lingle murder investigation. He deliv-
ered the principal address 'at the con-
vention of the Iowa High School Press
association yesterday afternoon at
2:30 in Herrick chapel. The topic of
his talk was “Adventures in News-
paper Reporting.”

The Lingle case is the most recent
important happening that Brundidge
has covered for his paper. He was in
Los Angeles at the time word came
for him to hurry to Chicago and
write the story of the slain reporter-s
death and the following investigation.

Believed Lingic a Crook

Even in going to the scene of the
crime he encountered adventure, as
the plane in which he was traveling
was forced to make a landing at night
in themountains, due to an electrical
Storm.

In his attempts to discover the slay-
er, Bruodidge uncovered evidence
that led to his belief that Lingle had
been a crook, using his reporter's job
as a stepping stone for obtaining bribes
and engaging in dishonest work. At-
ter the St. Louis Star had published
Brundidge’s story, a grand jury inves-
tigation was demanded.

Star Commended

Some delay then ensued, during
which time Brundidge interviewed
Al Capone, and after which the grand
jury commended the Star for publish—
ing the story of the Lingle case. One
of the biggest sensations in the'med-
ical field was uncovered by Brundidge
several years ago, when he revealed
the illegal practice of a national med-
ical diploma ring.

In this case he posed as a man
wishing to become a doctor, and for
the sum of 32,000 had diplomas giv»
en him Within two months for high
school, college, andmcdical courses,
besides a certificate to practice medi-
ine. As a result of his work in d
tecting the fake doctor “SChOo
methods, 10 medical schools Were
closed and graduates of second—class
colleges were therefore barred from
entering the study of medicine.

Interviewed Hollywood Stars

Brundidge spent about a year in

Hollywood interviewing theatrical

A 76-yard run for a touchdown, af-
ter three quarters of listless football,
was the turning point for Grinnell
last night when the Pioneers chalked
up a 12% victory over Cornell college
of Mount Vernon.

The tally came in the ﬁnal period
when Ulirich, Grinnell quarterback
drove straight down the sidelines,
and then cut over to the center of
the ﬁeld for the 76 ya‘rds and the
Score. Cornell, by virtue of its ﬁeld
goal in the second quarter had been
leading, a to 0.

Douglas Gets Second Goal

G'rlmJell'S second score come almost
immediately after the ﬁrst one. An
inspired team worked the ball down
the ﬁeld to the 15 yard stripe, and
then Douglas circled left end for the
second score. Ullrich’s try for the
extra point failed.

The Cornell line held like a stone
wall for the first three quarters, but
blew up in the ﬁnal period. Injuries to
Grinnell players during the game did

‘Perfect Alibi ’ Pronounced Pleasing Kelsey Elected
in Humor, Breath- Taking Element

Hensen Especially Praised
for Characterization

of Murderer

By HELEN KINGEBY

Certainly no play could have been
more pleasing to the general col—
lege audience than the bright and pro—
perly breath-taking mystery play of
A. A. Milne's, "The Perfect Alibi,"
given Wednesday and Thursday
nights in the Alumni Recitation hall
auditorium, directed by Mrs. Sara
Sherman Pryor, and acted by a group
of well-trained students.

The suspense of the story carried
the action along, and for the most
pa’i’t the ‘actors rose adequately to
the circumstance to make it Convlrh
cing. If there were any danger at
all, it was in a tendency to Over—com
vince, a lack of a certain reserve
which marked the playing indelibly
as amateur, and showed a yielding to
the role rather than any control Over
it.

Henson noes Well

Perhaps the most difficult char-
acter was the port of the murderer,
Carter, played by Lee Henson, It is
not an easy thing to murder a man
on the stage, and proceed to con-
vince the audience that he seems in-
nocent to the other actors in the play.

Mr. Hanson gave the part what it
demanded. He was remarkably at

Ottumwa Editor
Tells Delegates
of Editorial ‘R ’s’

Bumor, race, and religion, the three
“R's" should never be used as Sub-
jects for editorials, Clarence S. John-
ston, managing editor of the ottuni-
wa Daily Courier, pointed out in his
talk, “Editorials, Their Writing and
the Formation of Editorial Policies,”
before the delegates to the Iowa High
School Press association convention
at 1:45 yesterday afternoon in the
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium

"The high school paper is a cross
section of everything that happens,
and, therefore, the editorials should
concern everybody and everything,
and not merely the editor, his as-
soniates, and their ideas,” was the
main‘pcint Stressed by Mr. Johnston.
He also showed that the essentials
one must have to do editorial writ
log are a college education, speed,
initiative, experience Lu general news—
paper work, and a general knowledge
of what is going on everywhere in
the world.

In conclusion, Mr. Johnston illus-
trated that absolute Cooperation in
"newspaperdom" must be present in
Order to give the public the best news
and opinions abailable.

Alcxander ‘Juvenile Dead‘

Faith Somers carried it h e
part of Susan Cunningham, the con-
ventional Ward of the murdered man,
and final detector of his murderer, in
the typical ingenue manner. The
greatest mastery of her part came in
the last scene with Carter, where she
had both charm and command of the
situation. But With this self-posses-
sion, the clinging—vine grief of pre-
vious scenes was inconsistent.

Lee Alexander, as James Lude

the “juvenile lead” with a Certain

Mergers Great
Aid in Service

Baldridge Tells Journalists
ta Specialize in Talk
This Morning

"I do not apprehend any import-
ant dangers in the merger tendency
of newspapers," said Kenneth F.
Baldridge, publisher of the Chariton
Herald-Patriot, in speaking before
the press convention this morning at
5:30 on “The Growth of Group News-
papers.”

“We can give so much better, so
much more readable newspapers, that
this fact overshadows all dangers,"
went on Mr. Baldridge. "Of course
there are dangers if editorial calr
umns lose their idealism, or mailer
gers become unscrupulous, but the
same danger is in independent news-
papers, and to an even greater de-
gree.”
