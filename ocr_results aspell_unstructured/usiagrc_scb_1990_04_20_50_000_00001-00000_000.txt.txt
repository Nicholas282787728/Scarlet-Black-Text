Musicians Evaluate Loss

Music Trio Ends 15-Year Stay

By Craig Wacker

After almost thirty years , Grin-
nell‘s artist-in-residence program
is in jeopardy. The two remaining
artists—in-residence,MusicLectur-
ers Terry King and John Jensen
will leave by the end of the year.
Theirlcgacy,oneof ﬁfteen yearsof
service to Grinnell students, may
be the last of the artists-in-resi-
dence program

According to Ernest Ho, music
major and EPC member, the loss of
King and Jensen will be a great
one. Ho added that the two have
been an“integralpartofmyeduca-
lion.”

Both King and Jensen are
members of the nationally-re»
nowned Mirecourt Trio. Their
experience. according to H0, is
necessary in the teaching of music.
“They're the real anisls.” he said.
“Their record speaks for itself.“ I-Io

Terry King

added that King and Jensen are the
“core of the music program."
King expressed concem about
the fate of the anist-in-residence
program at Grinnell. He described
a three-pronged system of musical
education which must incorporate
creators, performers and theoreti-
cians as its essential components.
Performers. King assens, will be
the missing element if the anisrin-
residence program is terminated
He said that experienced per—tonn-
ers provide students with a vital
“reality check" from people who
have been in the business a while.

Both Ho and King emphasized
the college‘sduty lostudentswhen
considering the anisbinqesidence
program. According to Ho. “The
college should do what's best for
the student“King also stressed the
students’ entitlement to a quality
education.

He said that the main frustration
with the issue is the virtual exclu-
sion of the Music EPC from the de«
liberation over the artist-invresi»
deuce program.

Eliubeth Hayes, music depart-
ment chair, declined to comment
on the fate of the program.
