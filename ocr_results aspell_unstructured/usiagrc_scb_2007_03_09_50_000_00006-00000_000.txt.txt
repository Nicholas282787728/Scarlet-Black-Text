Bawdy opera still hot after 280 years

rsv MERRICK MEVERS

The mosttpcrformed play of the eighteenth
centrrry, Tor Beggar} Opri-a, is still a hit in the
twent) —first. It comes to Grinncil’s Mainstage
this weekend, the second time in the school's
history that the Theatre department has pres
duced this classic musrcal comedy

The play,wrrtten in 1728 by John Gay,dif-
feted from other musical productions ot its
time. While the average opera concerned itself
with the lofty doings ofhigh class gentlemen
and ladies, Tim Beggar's 02o” iras as its cast
an assortment of loWrclass thieves and pros—
titutes.This idea came from a correspoirdence
between Gay's friends Jonathon Swift and Al-
exander Pope.

Instead ofusing opera music sung nonstop
throughout the performance, Gay created the
ﬁrst “ballad opera,” featuring regular spoken
dialogue interspersed with bursts of popular
folk music. This eventually developed into
modern musical theatre,

The play, which features a Womaiuzing
lriglrwayman dealing with two young women
who both consider themselves his wife, as
well as their respective fathers who both want
him dead, enjoyed an extraordinarily long run
followed by numerous revivals and lucrative
merchandising, “It was the smash hit London
musical of 1728,"said director and Theatre den
partment chair Lesley Delinenico. “It was the
Corr of its day.’ Aside from a predictable loss
or repute during the Victorian era due to its
raunchy content, the popularity of Tie Beggar}
Opera has remained strong ever since .

Given the Complexity of putting on a mus
sical production, the Theatre department usu-
ally prefers to leave musicals to the student
group Grinneu Independent Musical Produce
tions (GIMP), However, Delmcnico said the
department stages a musical once every three
or four years, so that every student has the
chance to be in a musical at least once in their
Grinnell careers.

In the case otT/tt Beggar’s Ofmt, auditions
were held unusually early, before winter break.
and special care was taken that every interested
student had a chance to audition. The extra
time allowed the large cast to start learning
their lines, as well as their Cockney accents,

Williams Brown, Music, served as musical di-
rectors for the performance. Maggie Immicr
’07 was stage manager.

The Theatre department is currently
searching for new professors, making for a busy
semest .For this reason, Delmenico admitted
that in hindsight this might have not hccn the
ideal time to launch an ambitious undertaking
like 772: Beggarr 0pm. All in all, however, the
production has gone smoothly. “It’s been great
fun, and that's the thing about this place," she
said, praising the cast, the largest she's worked

with. “They've just brought so much to the
production in terms of their readiness and ea-
gemess." Tim Bzggm’l Opera is especially close
to Delmenico’s heart since it was the ﬁrst play
she was involved with during her own college
years at Lawrence University

Delmenico, along with Immler and the
music directors, trimmed the threerhour play
down to two hours to fit the modern atrcnt
tron span. The unabridged play contains o9
songs, most ofthem extremely short compared

music does not necessarily make them easier
on the cast’s throats.]ames Anderson ’08, who
plays the hrghwayman and also researched the
time period for- contextual information, said,
“A lot of the music was originally ﬁddle tunes,
so they’ve got a lot of small little notes going
up and down, and the violin can do that pretty
easily but my voice has a harder time.”

Tell me about your time at Grinnell.

Weltlwas a ja t naiic,even though I was
a lit major and I didn’t expect to he a jazz critic
when I left Grinncl . When
they had the famous convoca—
tion in 1967 they said [to me as
concerts chair] “Get somchody
important," so the ﬁrst person
I thought of was Louis Arms
strong, and by a bloody miracle
he was touring the Midwest
and had that night free.

Cecil Taylor was the most
controversial thing i did her
cause some of the students
claimed I had wasted student
funds on a charlatan and I was impeached. I
had to sit in the Forum Grill and wait for their
verdict, and I wasn't actually voted out ototﬁce
but it was a damned near pretty close call.

And at the same time the school was
bringing rrr other great speakers. Borges was
here—Jorge Lors Borges spoke in the south
Lounge at the Forum; Skip James was here.

 

Tire ﬁrst light show that the Jefferson Airplane
did before they tried it out at the Fillmore was
in Darby, the Joshua Lightshow,

What was the most memorable can,
cert experience you had when you were at
Grinnell?

For me it had to be Armstrong. Elling-
ton,1 can remember every detail, rd Taylor
was lifeschaiigiirguﬁut Armstrong rs God to
me, and actually shaking his hand, and the wry

he performed in Darby that night.
He died three and a halfycai 5 later.
That’s one of the most memorable
experiences otnry irtc. For the vast
maiority or Grinnell snrdents who
didn’t live in New York or Chicago,
or L A,, that was the only chance
the would ever have to see Ellrirgs
ton or Armstrong, two oftlrc great
ﬁgures ot’tlre 20th century. so I felt
that the angels wcie on rrry side rn

Gary Gidding l70 tins and i think most or the Stu-

dent body agreed.

With your career, has your Grinnell Colt
legs education helped?

Yeah,I loved Grinnell. I loved it, and hatr
ed it. I resented that a lot of friends of mine
who went to lvy League schools or erstcr-n
seahoartl schools were being courted or visited
at school by editors and publishers and people
who didn’t necessarily offer you jobs but of

feted you the kind ofadvice that I hope to pros
\lidc this visit to a few writers who want to be
professional, We didn‘t get any otthat. I feel
that that first year-I could have avoided ti lot of
mistakes and pitfalls if there had been a writer
I could have really talked to.

Brit what I loved about Grinnell, and you
have to remember this was the late ‘60:, mine
is thc class that didn’t graduate because ofKent
State, got out diplomas in the mail. Drugs
were rampant and 1 was doing more than my
share and politics was a constant theme, and
we were actrng out in all sorts ofways,

But the other tlriirg is Grinnell gave me the
time to grow up. i came here such a naive kid,
I dont know that I m a lot less naive now, butI
ccttainly felt like 1 wrs growing up at Grinnell
I was learning how to derl with people irom
All over the place which I had never done her
fore. They give you a lot ofioom.

Vi’hat do you think of Grinnell now that
you have heen back? How has it changed?

Well, of course it's changed, When you
ﬁrst get here you can't believe the arts build-
ing, the little thing added to Birding You can't
believe all those things rn the terrier of carur
prrs...so all ofthat is great. But the campus is
not as henuriﬁrl as it was because you’ve got all
these structures,

But the thing is aﬁer you're here tor a few
days and you get accustomed to the new build-

rngs it's the same place, In a way that's even
more surprising to me than the changes, It
really is the Same place. Grinnell had a reputar
tion as being the hippie school, but there was
always a strong conservatism, especially crii-
tur'aily; the Cecil Taylor impeachment was an
example, and I still see that here.

Have you enjoyed beingaprotcssor here?

I have. I've enjoyed the three weeks errors
mously...The treulty members, especially Eur
gene Gauh, who is responsihle for me coming
here, have been great.

I really have nothing negative to say except
my disappointment that there isn’t a der
partment; not a JHZZ (L‘ﬂCIIDI‘, but a department
VVrth somebody to conduct the orchestra and
sornehody else to teach history. Jar trrdies
are hecoming very big around the country and
a school as well-endowed as Grinnell, and as
hip as Grinnell, should have something more
than they do.
