Elimination of Administrative positions causes controversy

 

Dcar Editor,

This letter concerns the proceedings oithe open forum with Ptsidcnt
Osgood and Dean ctady on 3/17/99,

on the subieet ofthc college viewbook having a new look and feel, the
justification given vets that the change was an attempt to uphold trudi, in
that the new book is more “tine“ to the current state otevents at Crinnell.

on the subject otttutli, l was disappointed that neither administrator
could take the next step in explaining their need to remain within the strict
limits oftheir budgets, as being a condition of attending to the concerns of
the trustees. What concerns me about the administration’s reverential atti.
rude to the needs orthe trustees is that it categorically supeteedes theirwill-
iagans to attend to the needs of the students.

Sincerely,
Alexander Jacobs'96

 

Dcat Editor,

The campus is in turmoil because ofreeent eurs announced by the ad»
ministration. lwill actively oppose euts to the Student Affairs start.

Why am I doing what in doing? I wholeheartedly believe that losing an
RLC will make the quality oflifc on this campus deteriorate, audit will add
more burdens to already burdened RLCt. I’m an SA, I’vc seen my rules
schedule, I'vc seen her determination not to say anything against this deci—
sion, but Ive also seen the look on her face ofpride and hope when student
staiifwants to help change this i know it means an extra burden, SHE knows
it means an extra burden and i think Tom ctady knows it means an etttra
burden. As for who is to blame _well, no one we've mlkzd to, so fat.

Torn ctady made the best choice he could - I probably would have made
the same decision ifI were in his situation. The person to get upset with is
the one who decided that Tom would have to ctmte additional positions
without giving him additional money,

l also feel it is entirely appropriate for students to question administra-
tive decisions, to challenge them. besides the notion ofshared governance,
whieh means that the administration and SGA ate theoretically supposed to
be working together, there are other reasons i think this way

I challenge my professors, knowing that they have years of etpetienee
and knowledge that i inst dont. I challenge my patents, who have years of
eotpuicncc in life. When I challenge peoples assumptions or decisions. they
ate forced to r€»think them, perhaps with new information that sheds light
on a situation.

Whocvcr thought that Tom could make cuts and students wouldn't mind
could obviously benefit from student voice, by tc-thinkjng their opinion. I
admit that during these “Q & A” sessions, some people have gotten child-
ish. However, there are plentyofpeople who felt a mature response from me
administrators would have satisfied them. Why did we craft demands?

because the administrators were simply NOT responding to us! Instead,
they have resisted us all the way. By gaining SGA approval and Crafting
specifie demands, we gave the administration a clear idea ofwhat we want
and how they could respond to our voice and opinion.

otinnell is an institution that prides itselfon self-governance and shared
governance. Why is it continuing to ignore student input? When demands
passed through SGA’s Joint Board with only one abstention (and that per»
son was a substitute). students ate sending a CRYSTAL CLEAR message. Is
the administration going to r:spond???

We‘ll have to wait and see.

Respcctfully.

To the Edi tot:

I saw a ludietous email this morning (Thursday) in which the editor of
our beloved SBCB had to shoot down a suggestion mat the 8&8 be ptinted
blank this Friday except for the slogan “We have no Voice.”

I have an alternate suggestion that would be more appropriate. How
about for the rest of the semester the Sons appears blank widi the phrase
“WE HAVE NO MIND" emblawncdacmss the treat page, I feel that this
would more accurately tcilcct the state otthe eurrent student body.

The eenttal conflict here seems to be that the student body. or at least
those who have jumped on the current bandwagon, reels that it has no voice
with the administration Have any ofyou who are getting so uptight about
the elimination ofrwo administration positions paused to consider that you
may have a voice, but diat it is :omplctcly wrong in this case.>

We should be happy that we're getting rid ofADMlNISTRATIVE posi-
tions and view it as a chance to take on more personal and community
responsibility as a student body

in the future, take a minute to think things through carefully before you

. get pissed about something that somebody else says you should get pissed

about

lets face it people, there ate a lot more important things in this wide,
wide world to be worrying about right now. Get oifthe bandwagon and let's
get things donct

Sincerely,
Andy Weidner, ‘99

 

 

 

 

Du: Mr Cody,

I am a studcnt who attended the forum yasterday cvcning at which you,
President Osgood and Mt. Clay were present to listen to our concerns. I
realize that you must be bombarded with cmails these days, but I felt it
imperative to write and let you know that 1 was supremely dissatisﬁed with
some of last night’s events,

First, I would like to apologize on behalf of several membcrs of the stu-
dent body for thcit blatant misconduct and juvenile behavior. I am apolo-
gizing on the behalf of docs: people bcmusc I feel as if they often times
presented their largely teddess and ludicrous statements as speaking on be-
half of the student body without anyonc’s voluntary consent. 1 am rcclain-i-
ing my representation here by letting you know that some of these scntir
mcnts arc not shared by people Such as myself. lwas tailroadcd by some of
my fellow students last night, which brings mc to my scoond point oftegtet.

I did not stand up and against this misrepresentation and inconsidcre
arion. Had I been able to formulate bertct the thoughts switling in my mind,
I would have stood up and asked whether we govern ourselves as we say we
want to do, because we certainly were not dctnonstrating out sclfrgovcrning
capabilitis to you or anyone at that point in time. I atn truly sorry for these
things, but i am thankful that I did not stand up and spzw in a completely
reactionary fashion my concerns and thoughts, and am instead shatiag some
calmer, more coherent statements with you now.

I believe that thcrc is a time and space for forceful. emotional activism,
but this was not it, and I would strongly urge my fellow students to elioose
out battles better, or at least choose our war tactics more prudently, l fear
the consequenccs of last night in terms ofthc hostile opposition up toward
the front line of you three administrators, and so I write to you so that you
know that you are not being ignored, hated, or misunderstood, but that we
were being rather careless with a diligent person who is a great resource for
our needs and fine advocate of sclf-govctnancc. I can say that coordinating
positions will only serve to IMPROVE and AUGMENT our quality oflife
here at Gtinncll and as Grinncllians, you, RLC’s, and is our best and most
beneﬁcial bct for the futurc of this institution. The eliminating of two posi-
tions may free up funds and avenues for the betterment of orgnizing and
executing student events and campus activities, Meet us halhway, even if
wc’rc not at the crossroads, just yet. Although many of my fellow students
will not agree with me, I felt as if I needed to take an opportunity to express
another vicwpoint that was ovcrlookcd at last night‘s ptocccdings.

Sincerely,
J. Hudson Headey, ‘01

 

Dear Editor,

In the aftermadt ofTuesday nights meeting, I think some bouquets and
briekbats ate deserved,

First of all. I would like to commend Tom ctady, both for taking tull
responsibility for his decision to eliminate the jobs currently being held by
Paul valeneie and Lisa Matye. and for being straightforward and honest
with the student body. Mt. ctady received a iot otundeserved abuse. some
otthe eomnienrs directed at him eten bordered on personal attacks. This is
wtoag. Tom ctady is not the villain here. His budget got cut, he made a
djmcult choice, and he is taking the responsibility for it. He is in the same
bad situation as the test otus, and blaming him tot it is not only untait to
him, it takes attention away from the teal problem.

The Department ofStudeat Affairs is obviously underfunded. consid.
eting that the college is fat horn poor and that the tatstees have just cmv
barked on a very costly “Fund for Excellence" which will run die college
$5.7 million this yeat, this state ofafraits is unaeeeptable. How can we “ene
hanee out standing as a liberal arts college ofthe ﬁrst tank,” to quote tresi.
dent osgoods Principles ofthe Fund for Exeellence, ifwe ate unwilling to

maintain two positions vital to student life?

At the meeting, while Tom ctady was very straightforward about as»
suming responsibility for his decisions. president osgood pasted die buck.
As tar as I could tell from his etplanations, budget allocations ate largely
dictated by the Board ofTrustees. Therefore, I address this to them:

If one thing has become obvious in the past few weeks, it is that the
college does not have its priorities straight. There seems to be entirely too
mueh emphasis on changing our image, on improving out us. New and
World Report tanking, and not enough on keeping Crinnell Couege a good
place to live. The Director of student Activities and the positions ate very
important to outquality nflifc. Ifyou would come out to Crinaell and talk
to some ofthe students and RLCs, this would be immediately apparent.

It is true that the college will not come to a seteeching halt it these posi-
tions ate eliminated. Lisa Matyes many iobs will be spread over an increas»
ingly overworked stair. After paul leaves, the other ths will pidt up ant
other hve or site hours ofwotk a week, in addition to the sixty or so hours
they work already. They will do so willingly, out ortheit dedication to hdpe
ing the student body but thats not the pointt

John Aetni and Emilie Beavers made a very reasonable proposal Tuesday
night. Seeing no other way ofkeeping these important positions, they sub-
mitted a Fund tor Excellence proposal to fund die Director ofstudeatAc.
tivities and one RLC for one year. Their suggestion was rejected beans: it
did not in the narrow etitetia for a Fund for Excellence ptoposal.

Let me ask you this: what good is a Fund for Excellenee ifwe allow the
administration to deteriorate by attrition and pile even more duties onto a
shtinking number of overworked, iftxtremely dedicated, men and women?
There is no excuse for the Department of student Affairs being so
underfunded that we lose two very important positions. I urge you to take
some ofthat $5.7 million and earmark it for StudentAtiaits. We don’t need
a Fund for lateellence. We need adequam student support.

STUDENT CALL TO ACTION

AGAINST U.S. / U.N.
IMPOSED SANCTIONS
UPON IRAQ

Dear Editor,

For more than a century, student movcmcnu have had an impor-
tant place among the agents ofsocial change. students have a his-
tory offighting for peace and justice, In the 19605, students spurred
debates in Congress about the war in Vietnam and led the protests
for peace. students also struggled against discrimination and racism
7 both in the civil rights movement in the U.S. and in the fight to
end apartheid in South Africa. Now, in the 1990s, there is another
war we must end; another struggle for peace and justice in which we,
as students, must make our voices heard.

For more than eight years, out governtnent has been waging a
silent war against the people of Iraq. This month, the US-led sanc-
tions will kill 4,500 infants and toddlers, according to UNICEF re
ports. Today, this policy will kill 250 people in Iraq, as it did yCSXer»
day... and as it will tomorrow Since 1991, more than one million
people have died due to the scarcity offood and medicine and the
spread ofwatet—botne diseases - all direct consequences ofthe sane-
tions.

Since 1991. United Nations agencies and independent human—
rights organizations have been reporting on the devastating impact
of the sanctions on human life in Iraq. Four years ago, UNICEF
reported mat: “Sanctions ate inhibiting the importation ofspate pat-is,
chemicals, reagents, and the means oftiansportatiort rcquitcd to pro—
vide water and sanitation scrvicm to the civilian population oftran.

What has become increasingly clear is that no signihiaant move
ment towards food security can be achieved so long as the embargo
remains in place."

And what is out government’s response? When asked on “60
Minutes” about the death of halfa tniuion children in Iraq a more
children than died in Hiroshima, Madeline Albtight responded “we
think the price is worth it.”

We say NO! The death ofone child is a death too many.

As Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Edward Herman, and Ed—
ward said recentlysmted, in their national call for action, “The time
has come for a tail to action to people of conscience. We are past the
point where silence is pmive consent 4 when a etitne reaches these
proportions, silence is complicity."

We refuse to be silent in the face of this not.

We denounce the trade sanctions against the people of Iraq as
immoral, illegitimate and contrary to fundamental principles of hu-
manity and human rights. We demand that Congress and the Presi—
dent immediately end the ongoing sanctions war against the people
ofItaq.

We support the University ofMichigan's Student Assembly which
passed a resolution in January condemning the sanctions against the
people ofltaq.

We all upon an studcnm dedicated to pace to join the growing
movement to end the was aminst Iraq. Get more information on
how you can help end the war by sending an c—mail to
studentinfoolebnet emailtotstudentinfo@leb.net >. Check our
website at at http:I/lehner/iae/studentshtml .

It was the collective voice ofthe students that woke out nation to
the horror of the Vietnam War. We must once again issue the wake
up call to die eonscience of our nation.
