Talk On “Open Mind”

Using Tolstoy’s ”Where Love is,
God Is," Hilda. Mauck spoke on "Thu
Open Mind” at Pruyers Sunday morn-
ing.

”Where Love Is. God Is” is the story
of Mirth], a Russian cobbler, with the
basis of “Inasmuch as ye have done it
unto one or: the least oi these my
brethren, ye have done it unto me."

"The open mind," said Miss hleuck,
"is not merely being open to any new
‘-lsm’ that comes along. it lies in
having our minds open to the good of
others. The more we try to find what
we can (ll) for others. the more hﬂDDi
ness we will ﬁnd for ourselves."

“Blottis”

ACK in the iahplous nine
Bties when W. B. otis was
in college, he was ailec—
tionately k n o w n as
“Blotus”, a corruption or Elli
otis. Eill wrote the Alumni
song and graduated, probably
ignornnt of the feet that he had
made himscll famous by the ap-
I Dealing sentiment of the college
song he left behind him.
I When the college glee club
sang the Alumni song in the New
York contest, in. otis was in at
tendauce. He became inspired
again. In other words, "Blotus"
went "glassy-eyed", as in the old
days, and wrote three additional

verses to the Alumni song.

In a letter ahout the glee club
contest. lir. otis said, ”Their
singing of the Alumni song was
such a revelation nt exquisite in-
terpretation that it inspired me
to write three additional stanzas.
They are not as good as the
earlier verses, for i am older and
have grown somewhat stiff and
rigid poeticclly. But 1 could not
retrain from trying my hand
again on this occasion; if I have
sinned, kindly overlook the dot-
age."

The three additional stanzas
are printed below:

When in youth the red blood races and the hope is full and true,
And the glory of the morning Colors lite with every hue,

\Vhen 'gaihst wrong and all injustice longs the soul to hurl a lance
And the heart holds gleaming visions of a land of high romance.

the midst of care and strife

Comes a longing for 9. surcease, ror a breath or cleaner life,
When we raiter on the highroad in attempt to gain the prize,
Turn we then to Alma Mater, to her towers we lift our eyes.

When it holy quiet settles on the heart at end of day

And the careworn eyes gram dimmer and the golden hair turns gray,
When the lengthening shadows gather and 'tis almost time to rest,

And the sunset gently lingers in the splendor of the west.
