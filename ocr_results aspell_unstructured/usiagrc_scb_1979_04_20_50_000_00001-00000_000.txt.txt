Committee rejects
grade system

by Ailllt‘ Rawlaml

Last night the Curriculum Committee showed its disapproval of the
proposal drawn up by the Committee on Academic Standing to
changethe grading system by rejecting the measure

However. Dean Waldo Walker said the proposal only wcnt to the
Curriculum Committee for Comment and not for ﬁnal judgment. It will
be brought up at the next faculty meeting regardless of the vote,

THE PROPOSAL SUGGESTS a compromise between a move by
some faculty and administration members to institute an “F“ grade
and the college's present “erase” system,

Under the new system a grade of No Credit me» would be recorded
on a student's transcripts upon failing a course Presently, those who
fail courses do notretaln any indication of having taken the courses on
their permanant records, consequently receiving no penalty to their
grade point averages

CURRENTLY. A STUDENT could retake a NC course, but the
proposal calls for both grades to appear on the iinal records, although
the NC’would not be figured into a student’s GPA,

in addition to the NC grade, the system adds two new grades, a 3+
and C+ lo the scale. The new scale would be weighted as follovt'S' A,
,4 01A, 7; B+,3,3; B. 3 o. 8-, 2.7; C+.2,3; C,2.o; D, 1.0.

THE PROPOSAL LIMITS the courses that can be taken on the “CR-
NC" option to those outside a student‘s major The amount oi D grades
counted would remain at a total of 16. with none in the major field.

The proposal also sets the iinal date for dropping courses at the end
often weeks, out of the total 12 Weeks of classes, Currently, a student
may “erase” an undesirable grade simply by not taking the tinai
exam.

WALKER SUG ESTED ,\ grading system revision to the faculty
last January becausehe saidthc current system has a “negative ef~
feet ” He said in a letter to the faculty."'l'he students believe that it is
more beneficial to receive an erase than to receive the passing grade
of D."

Assistant to the Dean of the College Roger Koester, explained the
reasoning behind the dropping deadline was to prevent students who
are receivmg a grade lower than they wish trom dropping out at the
last minute. He said, ”Unfortunately, a student dropping a course
because oia B grade at the beginning oi finals happens often.”

HE SAID THE committee set the cut-off date at ten weeks because
by that time a student should know how well he or she is coming along
in the Course, “By the tenth week, students should have taken a mid
sem and maybe even have done a paper, they should have some sort of
idea of how they’re doing.”

KoeSter also pointed out the new system would help graduate
schools compare Grinnell students to those from other colleges He
said. “Our transcripts are not very truthful, and we’ve had some
trouble explaining our system." ,

"E NUTED AT registrars’ meetings. several school officials
acknowledged taking Grinnell's erase system into account when
figuring both transfer credits and GPA's for students applying ior
graduate study.

Ronald Kurtz. Chairman of the Faculty, likes the compromise
because it adds accountability, “I think it’s probably a pretty good
compromise, it doesn't count against a student‘s GPA, but we do have
a record of whether a student has taken something or not."

SALT—avoiding the arms race

by James Goodfellow

If the Senate ratifies the Soon-[07
beconciuded SALT ii treaty. the
arms race will be substantially
slowed says political science
protessor Wayne Moyer.

The pact will ”substantially
reduce the pace of the arms race,
but if the Senate does not ratify the
treaty then American deiense
expenditures will probably in
crease by billions ot dollars a
year,” he said,

THE TREATY, AND its implica
tions for the United States, will be
the subject oi an address by Paul
Warnke, former chief SALT
negotiator for the U.S., tomorrow.
The talk is set for 1:30 pm. in

 

 

Grapevine appears next

byFaulSchwartz
This semester's issue of the
Grapevine will be released as

“traveled a long and rocky road in
doing the work,” said Miller.

scheduled on Friday, April 27, said
Grapevine editor Laurie Cragg.

Cragg said she was glad to have
received the largest feedback of
evaluation forms in the history of
the Grapevine, with 65 percent of
the student body responding to the
questionnaire.

When asked about the tone of the
publication. Cragg said, “I’m very
concerned that there’ll be disap
pointment in this issue because in
the past the Grapevine issue has
been antagonistic, slanderous and
somewhat humorous."

THE MAIN EMPHASIS of the
Grapevine is to supply an informa-
tive and comprehensive source
which can aid students in under-
standing what they might be
coming up against next semester,
Cragg said,

A staff comprised of five
membersiBecky Hartman,
Tracey Miller, Dave Molho, Rose-
mary Strunk and Mia Turneri
helped Cragg in producing the
nrapevine. Each person tackled

PROFESSORS WILL BE given a
chance to respond to the students’
rating of their courses for the first
time in this semester's Grapevine,
Cragg said. After the course
faculty evaluation torms have been
tabulated by computer, the
Grapevine staff will contact each
proiessor, he said. The professors
will be told of the students’
responses to their courses and
style of teaching. The professor
can then respond to the inter-
viewing staff member, who will
summarize this response in a brief
paragraph which will appear near
the ratings of the professors
courses.

Evaluations will be grouped by
department, listed in alphabetical
order. A cross reference section
will be provided in the back of the
pamphlet. listing each professor
and the courses taught by that
individual instructor, Cragg said.

THE RATING SYSTEM used is
based on a scale from i to 7, with a

score a pr'oiessor can receive, she
said. The questions were divided
into three categories, separately
evaluating the teacher. me course,
and the course as compared to
other Classes.

Cragg said she was somewhat
displeased with the current
procedure oi compiling the
Grapevine, which she feels in
creases the difficulty in trying to
make this issue an important,
meaningiul, publication. she
criticized the method of
distributing the questionnaires,
noting the staff was fortunate in
receiving nearly twice as many
responses for this issue than
previous editions had received.

"I'D LIKE TO see the course
evaluations made mandatory,
possibly at pre-registration,"
Cragg said She added the present
random lot sample could very
easily misrepresent the student
body’s general consensus on a
course and its protessor.

In addition to making response to
the Grapevine mandatory, Cragg
said she would like to see the
questionnaire lengthened and

“The agreement will limit each
Side to 2.400 delivery vehicles,
which are either bombers or
missiles, and of these 1320 may be
MIRVed (Multiple Independent
Reentry Vehicles). Each side is
allowed to develop one new missile
system.” Moyer said.

The purpose of SALT ii is not to
make a one shot attempt at diss
armament. but to take a large step
in that direction. “We‘re still in the
arms control stage, We've got to
get an agreement on control beiore
we can even begin to consider
disarmament,” said history in
structor Harley Balzer,

SALT ll IMPOSES more ress
trictions on both the composition
and iurther development of the
nuclear arsenals than did SALT l.
“SALT I permitted continued
expansion on missile construction.
but under the new agreement the
Soviets will have to in effect,
disassemble some of their
missiles. There was no limit on the
number oi systems that could be
developed under SALT I," Moyer
said.

SALT II does not reflect a
significant growth in trust between
the Soviet Union and the United
States. “I don't believe the present
SALT agreement reflects a
Wlllingness of either side to trust
the other,” Moyer said. “What
both sides are doing is in their
common mutual interest We’re
only willing to talk to each other
and act if we have common in
terests at stake.”

THE TREATY DOES not signal
the beginning of Soviet-American
in other areas of
conﬂict. “The Soviet analysis is
that they can still have detente and
SALT and engage in adventures in
Africa and Asia," Balzer Said.

The objective of both countries
boils down to a desire to decrease
defense expenditures. "Both
countries have serious social
problems and that‘s what they
want to spend their money on,"

 

Bulzer said.

SOVIET PREMIER Leonid
Brezhnev is as committed
politically to achieving an agree
ment as Carter, Balzer says. “I
have the sense that Brezhnev is\
overwhelmingly committed to
SALT II. It is a Symbol of detente
and Brezhnev has put his weight
behind detente."

Both Moyer and Balzer believe
that the negotiations will reach a
final agreement shortly. "There
isn’t a single major issue
remaining sol don't think there's a
problem," itioyer said,

THE SENATE MUST ratify
SALT II before the agreement can
go into affect. Assistant professor
of politics science Robert Grey,
views the prospects for Senate
ratification with skepticism “The
administration had to wage a
major campaign ofarm twisting to
get the Panama Canal Zone treaty
ratified and that was trivial in
comparison with SALT," he Said,

Moyer says opposition in the
Senate gravitates around a general
mistrust of Soviet intention.

BALZER DOESN'T View Am
erican capacity to verify as a real
issue. “We can verity, We don't
have to trust them, If they cheat in
a major way we’re going to
become aware," he said.

in the end, it will be public
opinion which makes or breaks
SALT. Meyer said. “In the absence
of any public pressure at all,
Congress will vote SALT down,” he
said.

“IF THE PUBLIC is evenly split,
it shouldn’t have very much im~
pact at all. If many more support it
than oppose it, public opinion will
make some difference. But the real

. pressure can be brought to bear by

the opinion leaders. These are the
leading individuals such as
businessmen, political activists,
and academics. Iia preponderance
of them support the treaty, that
will make a significant dife
ference," Moyer said.
