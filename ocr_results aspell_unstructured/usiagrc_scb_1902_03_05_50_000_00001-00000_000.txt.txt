F. Bradley, President Bradley
arrived in Grinnell on Tuesday
morning and be here till
Thursday, when he goes to Des
Moines. He will retlirn to Grin-
nell Friday and irom here will go
directly to his home in Grand
Rapids, Mich. His present visit
is for the purpose of getting into
touch with the Institution in pres
paration ior his active service
later. This does not imply that
Dr. Bradley has not already ens
teretl into his work, for he cers
tainly has, as it is entirely foreign
to his nature to do otherwise.

On his way to Grinnell he
stopped at Chicago and conierred
with Dr. Harper, whose friendship
and respect ior Grinnell are well
known. He will give the com-
niencement address at Oberlin
Theological Seminary on May is
On May iSth he will conduct the
Sunday services at Ames,.lowa,
and from this time on will take
up his permanent residence in
Grinnell. It is very much res
gretted that he cannot remain
here from rrow trll commencement
so that the student body may
come into a more intimate
iationship with him.

A reception has been arranged
for this evening at the home of
Miss Mary Chamberlain on Park
St. to give the alumni and seniors
an opportunity to meet President
Bradley,

The houis for the seniors are
from 7tlll 8:30, It was thought
best to limit the seniors to these
hoursbecause oi the large number
ot alumni residing in Grinnell, all
oi whom will desire to be present
and there is danger oi over-taxing
the capacity of the reception
rooms.

Dr. Bradley conducted the

short chapel exercises this morn
ing and yesterday morningand the
wish or all is that he may be pres»
cot and have charge oi the Frl~
day morning services.
