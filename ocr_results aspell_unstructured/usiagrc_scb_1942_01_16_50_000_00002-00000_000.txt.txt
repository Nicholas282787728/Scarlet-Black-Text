0 Do It Now.

When the trumpets of war sounded over Pearl
Harbor, Americans of every race and posi-
tion responded immediately to offer their
services to the United States Government.
Recruiting stations were deluged, Washing-
ton was beseiged by men with proven abil—
ity, and banks and post-offices everywhere
were busy selling defense bonds to patriotic
Americans.

What have you done?

To relieve you of your embalrasment,

June I has been set as a

a twin drive for student contributions to
the Victory Book and War Emergency Red
Cross campaigns.

The books received are to be sent di-
rectly to army camps; the funds received
are to be utilized in stricken areas in Amer»
ican territory.

Students, this is total war. Are you going
to do your bit? .

0 Voices in the Hurricane.

Got a letter today from our medic friend at
the U., telling about Satch. Satch works on
a defense job. He thinks he’s making his
pile, and things look like all sunshine and
roses in his part of California. Therefore,
our man Satch got married the other night.
Yes. Just like that!

The medic is very much upset. His
friends are shoulderilig aims or making
them while he is left sitting on his books.
His friends are getting married right and
left while he is left like a lone tree on a
hilltop.

“Fools will rush in,” he comments in his
letter, “and yet, perhaps I am the fool. They
are the majority, and ill a world in which
nothing is certain but change, they are
grabbing at what little happiness they can
find. I have held out for security, and yet

securityl7 What is that? A ghost
“old."

Answered that letter right away. Had to,
even though in the beginning there didn’t
seem to be anything to be said. It wasn’t
easy. A whole hour passed before these few
sentences were in in :

“You-are right; you know that you
are. They are the fools. All the odds are
against Satch and the rest. Stick to your
own guns while the storm lasts. For
even though it never rains but it pours,
we have had storms before. And storms
pass.”
