Foul mile; Scchrisf, Reece, Koa and
Gordon. These men made the best

week.

Grinnell Leads Last Ye'nr. >

Last year the Pioneer haltrniile
team took ﬁrst in their division of their-
race, two heats being made necessary
because of the large number of en—
tries. The mile team took fourth, and
these points, together with the points
gathered by Hass when he annexed
the special century dash, gave Grin-
nell a lead over the other contenders.
A large number of high schools, col—
leges and universities are always in
attendance, and some remarkably good
records have been set. The special lau—
yard dash will be repeated this year.
and some of the best dash men in the
country have been entered.

Sherman Wrong, Says Hadley I

 

 

 

 

 

MR. AND MRS.

War is not always what Sherman
says it is, according to Ed Hadley, ‘16,
who has been engaged in relief work
in the Near East since the close of
the war, and Marguerite Feys Hadley,
his pretty Belgian bride, says the same
thing.

Mia and Mrs.‘Hadley were ma led
at Tiflis February 10, as the result of
a romance which had begun in Sep—
tember in Batunl. At that time Mr.
Hadley was port receiver at Saturn,
and was the only American there
when Col, William N, Haskell who
took the place of President Main
arrived. With Colonel Haskell came
his stenographer, Marguerite Feys.

In October Mr. Hadley went to
Novorossiisk, Russia, to arrange for

ED, HADLEY. ,

grain to be sent to Armenia. He rc-
turned to Tiflis in January where he
and Ni. Fcys were married. Since
their marriage in February, they have
been engaged in getting back to lowa.|
They arrived in Grinneil, April 13.

Mrs. Hadley was General Pershing’s
ﬁrst stenographer, and instructed the
staff officers in French. Before the
war her home was at Dixmude, Bel<
gium. Her family who are living in
Paris plan to return to Dixmude to
rebuild their home which was des—
troycd by the German army.

Mr. Hadley who graduated from
Crinnell in 1916 was on the Scarlet
and Black staff for three years, and
was president of the Men's Glee Club.

Mr. and Mrs. Hadley are visiting

FiENiHAwiin DEGREE
T0 simulLAleius

Noyes Is First American To Get
French Doctor Degree from
Sourhonlle,

William A. Noyes Jr. '15 has been
awarded the degree of Doctorred—S r-

ence (d‘EtaL) at the University of Par» i

is. This is the highest scientiﬁc de—

gree that is awarded at the oldest of
modern universities and Mr. Noyes is
the ﬁrst American who has ever rec
oeived this distinction. He is at pre
sent a Fellow in Chemistry of the So—
ciety for American Fellowship in
French Universities, an organization
for the furtherance of closer educa-
tional relations between France and
America. 4

'After graduating from Crinnell he
spent some time in special work at
the University of Illinois where his fa.
ther, W. A. Noyes '79 is head of the
Chemistry department. He served as
a second Lieutenant in the Signal
Corps during the war and after secur-
ing his discharge be entered the Uni-
versity of Paris and was the ﬁrst Amr
erican to begin work for the doctorate
at the University.

The thesis which Dr. Noyes submit—
ted to the Faculty of Science was “Por
larization in iron Solutions" and it
was prepared under the direction of
the noted Chemist,l’rofessor Le Chat-
eliar. ,
in speaking of this award the New
York Herald de Paris says.

“In announcing the successful re
sult of the oral examination of Mr.
Noyes in the “Salle du Doctornt” at
the Sorbcnne, the chairman of the ex-
amining board congratulated the can»
didate upon being the ﬁrst American
to receive the French State degree in
science, all previous American candi—
dates for the doctorate in science hav—
ing reeieved only the degree of “Docs
teur d’Universite,” which is conferred
by the university itself and does not
carry the same privileges of eligibilL
ty to professional position in the
French educational system.

“Dr, Noyes will spend the spring
and early summer in the French pro.
vinces and in Switzerland, after which
he will return to America to take up
his duties as teaching fellow at the
University or California, where he will
also be a candidate for the American
Pit. D. degree. I

TWU GIRLS AWARDED
SGHﬂLAﬂiHLP HDNNHS

Mary Braginton and Anita. Kleiu‘
Given Scholarships in East-
ern Schools.

Mary Braginton, ‘20, has been a»
worded a scholarship in the graduate
school of Yale, and Anita Klein, ’13,
has been awarded a resident fellow-
ship at Smith College.

Miss Bl'aginton will‘receive a sco-
lzu‘slil'p amounting to $200 in the grad-
uate school of Yale and will do work
in the classic department. To win
such a scholarship is considered a
very great disﬁnction because of the
fact that Yale is primarily a man’s in—
stitutioh, and while women are ad—

arships are very rarely granted them.

Miss Braginton's home is at Manson,
lowa. She was one of the four seniors
to receive Phi Beta Kappa honors a
‘Iew weeks ago, and was also awarded.
the Junior scholarship and the ﬁrst
Phelps Greek Prize. She is a mem—
ber of the Y. w. C , Aegis literary
society. and the Cu Honor-C Club.

Miss Klein will receive a resident
fellowship of $500 and tuition at Smith ,
College at North Hampton, Mass. 1

She will also do worlt in Greek and
jLatin. Miss Klieh's record was very
high and she was a member of Cap
and Cown. Since her graduation she
has been teaching and this year is lo-,.
cated at Runnells, Iowa.

William T. Sherman, '13, has been
Selected as assistant football coach for
next season, according to an nu~
nouncement this week. He will also
act for the college in the capacity of
ﬁeld secretary and may also coach
baseball and track. '

Sherman has been coaching at North
Des lloincs High School this year,
and turned out a team which was ad-
mitted to be one of the best in the
state.

Athletic experts consider Sherman
‘as one of the best football players
ever turned out at Grinncll. Playing
halfback at a time when the Pioneer-
athletic fortunes were not at their
height, Sherman made a name for Dinar
self and for Grinnell throughout the.
state. Although perhaps the smallest
college player in the state, he was
given places’ on all-state'teanns, and
;was admitted to be one of the best

in the 410 yard dash. and Sechl‘l‘st, ‘20.‘,halfbacks in the west. ,Sherman was
