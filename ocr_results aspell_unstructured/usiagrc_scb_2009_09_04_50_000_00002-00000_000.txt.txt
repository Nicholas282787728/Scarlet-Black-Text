Class. of 2613 sets diversity standard

Grinnell’s strong sense of campus community draws students from across the world

BY CHle DAVlS

Following two consecutive years of recordrsemng firstr
year class sizes, one might expect that the comparatively di~
minutive class of 2013 would do little to stir up the level
of attention garnered by the previous two classes. As most
returning students are still trying to get used to 378 new
faces all around campus, the class of2013 has already made a
siihstantial impact on the student body at large, setting a new
record as proportionally the most diverse class ever matricus
lured at Grinncll College.

Among the 378 students in the class of 2013, domesr
tie students of color make up 26 percent
of the class, while international students
make up 13 percent, Members ofthe first
year class come to Grinnell from 42 differ—
ent states and 28 countries.

2013’s diverse makcup is no accident,
but rather the result ofa concerted effort
that extends beyond the admissions office
“There is wide agreement around diversir
fying the student body from a lot of difr
ferent of perspectives," Elena Bernal said,
Vice President for Diversity and Achiever
merit. “The board oftrustees especially has
exerted a great deal of pressure and sup-
port to ensure that Grinnell continues to embrace diversity."

In light of last year's over-enrollment, the college was
forced to take measures to keep the size of the student body
in check, according to Seth Allen, Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid. “We planned on enrolling a smaller class than
lastyear,"Al.len said. “As a result, the Admissions department
was forced to be more stringent in evaluating applications.
Last year, we admitted 35.6 percent of applicants, [it was]
down to 27 percent this year," Allen said.

Both Allen and Berna] noted that increased selectivity
in the admissions process had some beneﬁcial effects. “This
year we were more able to evaluate applicants based on the
kind of energy and outlook they bring to the college," Allen
said. “You're notjust looking to fill a class, but you‘re looking

to bring those students to Grinnell who are most willing and
able to fit within our cominunity,"Bernal said.

Thus far, it seems that admissions succeeded in choosing
students that truly fit Grinnell. “There's a sense ofcommur
nity here that I didn’t get at other colleges," Hannah Kapp-
Klore ’13 said of her reasons for choosing Grinnell. ” Stu-
dents are smart but not pretentious,” she added.

Similarly, Nolen Royalty ’13 cited the supportive learn-
ing~driven community that Grinnell offers as motivation for
attending. “Being at a school whcrc people are motivated by

genuine interest rather than their grades
has been really good for me so far,"Royr
city said,

Other new students experienced
newfound academic fulfillment since
entering Grinncll. ”The people I’ve
met have already instilled new interests
in me," Tim Greenﬁeld ’13 said. Even
those among the 27 incoming trans-
fer students have had similarly posir
nvc experiences. "People here are more
academically serious but still like to
have fun,"Terian Kosick '12 said, who
transferred after spending her first year
at Knox College. “Grinnell has a lot or the qualities 1 ap-
preciated about Knox, but with a more academically serious
environment."

Berna] cast Grinnell’s goals ofdivers'tty as crucial not only
to the college's commitment to social justice, but to the founr
darions of the liberal arts “Ifthere are not engagements and
interactions across differences on this campus, we are essen-
tially replicating the very conditions we lament when we talk
about social justice," shc said.

“Now we begin to actually embody the diversity that
we’ve been talking about for decades,"Bemal saidf‘The suc-
cess in this year's class is not a plateau—it’s just another step
in continual growth."
