‘Educators Have Better Perspective
on Economic Situation,’ Says Shelley

 

"Educators look nt things from :1
long distance point of View," was the
opening statement of James Shelley,
humanist and educator, and stud‘ent
of drama and art, from Canterbury
college at Christchurch, New Zea-
lahd. in his lecture on “Communica—
tion and the Future of Ci lizaticn."
in Herrick chapel Thursday evening.

“That is why. perhaps,” he said
“some of us in the world of the unis
versity, and particularly a university
which is in some such outroﬂthe-wsy
part of the world as New Zealand.
may have a better perspective in
viewing the present economic situa-
tion than those who confront it face
to face.”

Transition Significant

Professor" Shelley undertook to
prove that the transition the world
is going thru at this very moment is
more significant than any that has
occurred in the last 12 or 15 thousand
years. “At that early stage in our
history, man discovered agriculture,
and that was the greatest revolution
in human life. Thru the demands of
agriculture man developed a permanr
ent home, acquired property; children
were no longer a nuisance but they
became a~plaything . . . when they
grew older, an asset. and so the fame
ily developed.

“Until thc end of the eighteenth
icr nineteenth century the idea of

life as a great family complex or
sentiment was the dominating factor
in history. Even now certain tribes
of natives in Australia and the south

.sea islands have not entirely discover-

ed the idea of private property or
entered upon this partriarchal civili-
zation."

’ “Urban Communism"

Just within the last two genera-
tions has modern life been breaking
away from ”the family estate as a
creative unit," or ”the tradition of
localism”, according to Professor
Shelley. “There has been a drastic
break in that unifying factor, family
affection."

He describes people as living in a

lnew "collecting stage" similar to the

one of some 15,000 years ago. "Go
into a friend’s home and he immed—
iately shows you his collections, from
Japan, the Malay peninsula, or where
ever it may be. We are shifting from
localism to an urban communism,
Everyone uses the hotels, the art
galleries, and goes to see the same
films the world over."
Arbitration Inadequate

As a result of this too rapid change
the speaker characterized war, the
tariffs, mental diseases, and partic-
ularly the world depression as dis-
hsrmonies that may be permanent in
the new social order, “We must
either prcpare to see our civilization

Idisplaced by another," he said, “as

it may be in the occasion of a world
crisis that should lead to another war,
or we must watch it disappear in a
process of decay."

Professor Shelley contends that it
is a false idea that "economic prob-
lems are amenable to an economic
solution". He described the futility of
trying to solve unemployment in New
Zealand by a program for public
works, by “creating work that does
n’t need to he done. The workers
know that and so they spend their
time “Smoking cigarettes and lean-

[ing on their shovels.

the idea of work. Neither is or tra-

Quadrangular
Meet Tonight
Draws Squad

University of Iowa, Drake,
Iowa State to Provide

Stiff Competition

A squad of 14 Pioneer runners left
with coach Les Duke for Iowa City
this noon to compete in the quad»
rangular meet tonight in which the
four leading institutions of the state,
Drake, Iowa State, Grinnell and Uni-
versity of Iowa are participating.

The program of events will be the
same as in dual meets with the ex—
ception of the addition of a half mile
relay, and the omission of the open
quarter mile. The mile run will be a
team affair, using much the same
scoring system as in crosscountry
events.

Pilbrow Favored

Grinnell should be strong in this
race with Pilbrow, Pfeiffer, Ger—
hardt, and Murphy competing. Each
school will be allowed four entrants,
the first three across the finish line
figuring in the final tally.

The Grinnell contingent will be led
by the sensational Myron Pilbrow,
120110th two-mile star, who defeated
Clark Chamberlain of Michigan
state at the Notre Dame meet last
week. He should have no'trouhle in
winning, since Iowa has no strong
men. and he has already beaten the
Drake and Iowa‘sgdte men in prevA
ious competition.

Thomas in Relays

The omission of the “Oryard dash
will force Hank Thomas to confine
his activities to the two relays and
the low hurdles. Alexander and Paj-
man will be entered in the 60—yard
dash, and will probably compete on
both relay teams.

The probable personnel of the Grin.
nell squad is: Alexander, Pojman,
sprints; Murphy, half-mile Pilbrow,
Pfeiffer, Gerhardt, mile run; Pilbrow,
Barber, Pfeiffer, two mile run; Golz,
James, McKee, broad jump; Rose,
shot-put; W. Grounds, hurdles:
Thomas, hurdles; Edman, high jump.

Drake Strong

The Pioneer mile-relay team. which
pushed Notre Dame to a new confer-
ence record last Saturday, will prob
ably include the some members, Ala
exander, Pojman, Thomas, and Mur—
phy. They will have strong competi-
tion from Iowa State and University
of Iowa. Iowa State's team won the
state championship last year.

Drake and cha are doped to fight
it out for fi st place, w lie the battle
for third place hctwccn Grinnell and
Iowa State should be just as close.
The Bulldog , with an extremely wcll-
bnlanced squad, ‘lould take the meet
by a close margin.

No preliminaries will be rim, since
cach school is limited to two entrants
in each event except the mile run. All
races will he run tonight.
