The College is preparing an alumni
address book which is to be published
_ soon, and which will contain the pres-
ent occupation and address by classes
of each alumnus.
tlon that will be welcomed among the
alumni and will be of real benefit in
ieadily determining the class of a

graduate. Since the publication of
the quinquennial register in 1896 old

College Catalogues

This is s publica»

and directories
have been the only means of ready
reference to ohtnin information. Such
a pamphlet will he a welcome adtlir
tion to our alumni tlil'ecto

The actions or some of the audience
at the game last evening cannot be
commended to say the least. Niniier
sota played a creditable game and act»
ed the part oi gentlemen throughout.
and there was no occasion tor the
silghLing remarks that Callie ironi cer-
tain sections oi the gallel'v Basket—
- an e\‘—
Ceeding rougher game that a Grinnell

ball among the univers ie

audience is accustomed to watching.
and all violations of the rules is a
matter for the relcrce to decide and
not the audience. We hope that more
proper respect will be shown the otll~

er teams that play here this season.

About two rears ago Colorado Col-
lege at Colorado Springs undertook to
misc $300,000 bl' Janum‘l‘ lst, 1903.
and were to secure $100.000 from the
General Educational Board ii success-
ful. in addition to this \lr. Andrew
Carnegie ottered $50,000, Tile cam-
paigll has been sncccssinl and in spite
of the ﬁnancial panic in the closing
davs of the campaign. the total amount
ra 'ed, including the large gifts, is
$512,000. This brings thc total endow-
ment of the school up In almost one
million dollars, and the success of the
institution is assured for many years
in come. This campaign is or interest
to lowa College because the condi-
tions are the same as we are llllliﬁtlr
taking. and Colorado Collcge is cone
sidcred one of the strongest emigre
gatlonnl colleges in the west
The semester fee is the
