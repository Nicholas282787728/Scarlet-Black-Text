Keohn linrl Nemeth were Victorious
in their first match but bowed to
Cornell in their second. Judy Chun
and Scltuli were seeded fourth in No.

but fell to Ripon.

“Constderi v the fact IJTrtl we
lost to Cornell and Beloit in dutil
meets. we played very well at the
tournament." commented Fturchild.
She continued. “We were able to get
seeded and our draws were good."

Fairchild attributed hcr sqllad's
success over the last three years to
better players and overall positive
team attitude. Seniors Fortand Chun
have conuihuted to a 40-10 dual-
mecl record in their four years. “We
are going to miss Amy and Judy. but
with a couple of recruits we should
have a very good team in thefulure,"

Pl‘itsch and the entire team felt good
about leaving Texas with two ties.
The Trinity game ended in a 1—1 tie
after two overtimes. and the Austin
game was 0-0 after two overtimes.
Austin was the first team to keep the
Pioneers out of the goal this season.

“We played well. and I think we
should be thankful for the two Lies."
commented Pfitsch. “We always
play well away. and we proved that
again. We also had plenty of rest.
which has hurt us in past trips.“
Pfitseh was also pleased that theteam

Nicole Nemeth serving
Men's Soccer team ties twice in Texas, will host
the Midwest Conference this weekend

tions. The first game was at night,
and the second one was played in 90
degree Texas heat. "We played well
under the lights. considering that we
had never been in a night game be
fore. The heat did take a toll on our
players, butthey hung in there well."

An asthma condition related to
the heat and humidity kept Sean
Ramsey out of much of the Trinity
game and all of the Austin game.
Midfielder Tim Edmonds continued
to be hampered by a hamstring condi-
tion which has plagued him much of
the season. He. too. saw limited ac
tion. Both should be ready to play in

the conference tournament.

“We have had guys coming up
and playing very well for our injured
players.” noted Pfitsch. He praised
Mike Stenberg. Chung Chaeand Niel
Goodspeed for their play in Texas.

The Pioneers will be recuperat-
ing this week and preparing for their
shotat the conference title. “We will
be rested and ready to go when this
weekend rolls around." Pfilsch con-
cluded.
