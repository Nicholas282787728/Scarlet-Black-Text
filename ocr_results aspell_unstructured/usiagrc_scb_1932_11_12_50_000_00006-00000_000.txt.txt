High School

Dick Ullrich, Pioneer quorterbsek
and Grinnelrs bid for all-state and
all-Missouri Valley honors, did not
ploy football before ettending coir
legc.

When he was graduated from
Roosevelt High school at Des Moilles‘
in 1927, chk weighed 135 pounds.
Now his weight is 180. He annexed
seven high school letters, however, in
basketball, track, tennis and goli,
playing for thme years as a member
of the Roosevelt golf ioursorne which
won city, county and state honors.

On Chompion tinge Tenm

For two years otter finishing high
school, the Pioneer flesh worked in
Detroit, Mich, tor the Hudson-Essex
corporation, playing on the national
championship Detroit Y.M.C,A. csge
team during that time,

Entering Grinnell college in 1929,
Dick immediately showed promise as

sophomore year, he won his letter
in competition to such backfield men
as Ben Douglas and Russell Ruff.

Dick Ullricil, Pioneer Quarterﬁack,

after Coming Here

attempting a handrsLaud in the club
room of his residential hall here, he
fell, breaking his ankle and was laid
up for the remainder of the season.

This season, ullrich has been Grin—
Dell's greatest scoring threat, His
powerful punts. averaging 50 yards.
have kept the Pioneer goal out of
danger a number of times and his
place kicks have counted for all of
Grinnclrs points otter touchdown.
Against Drake at Des Memes, his
punts bucking a, stiff wind were well
above nversge length, and kicking
with the wind, several traveled 60
and 70 yards.

Near Volley Top

He is near the top of Missouri
Volley scoring this season with e to~
tal of 5 touchdowns and a nlacekichs
for extra point, he had scored 36
points against Grinnell's opponents
and M against Missouri Valley
teams, before the Creighton game
yesterday.

Although not the fastest man on
the team, Ullrich has the most pows
eriul, stride and is extraordinarily
shifty for n heavy man. He runs with
his legs for sport, knees up. and
takes a long stride, making it hard
for tseklers to grasp more than one
leg. on tackle smashes are his
specialty,

Newspaper men at most Lansing,
Mich, rated him one of the best backs
to appear xgaiust the Michigan state
team this year.
