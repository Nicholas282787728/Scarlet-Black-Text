III Tllirtl Clutpcl Talk.

"The active principle in modcrnclv-
ilization is Jesus Christ," declared
Dr. Nahoth Osborne. in his second
lecture at Herrick chapel on the Gates
foundation, "The Signiﬁcance or
Jesus in Civilization.”

Although Jes‘us' contribution was
not astronomical, nor chemical, nor
psychological, nor economical, Jesus
taught men how to use the discoveries
of these sciences. “Jesus asked,
"How (lo these things make better
and nobler men and women,’ " said the
speaker, and He always insisted upon
an answer,

Signiﬁcant in Home

Dr. Osborne first: took up signiiie
cance of Jesus in Roman civilization.
Rome had built up a mighty empire
on the soundest of moral principles.
She had built harbors. constructed
roads, deepened highways, organized
the finest army of the world com—
manded by the greatest generals, and
had made the Mediterranean a little
lake whose shores were her colonies.
Christianity came to Rome when that

empire was just beginning to slip.
The accounts or Pitul, the descriptions
or contemporary literature, and the
sculpture and decorations or Poni—
peii all show how low Rome was be-
ginning to sink in her moral and so-
cial liie.

But every great mini, and Every
great institution, does not (lie witl‘k
out a. Struggle, declared Dr. Osborne,
and the Roman empire is no excep-
tion. Home ﬁrst tried to rise through
the development or a. great mystery
religion. or this mystery religion we
know but littleilt was "full of se-
crets, like a. college fraternity—ab
though they mean little. they are
secrets just the same." The signifi—
canoe or this mystery religion lies in
the fact that its priests found redemp-
tion from sin, and B. hopc of immortal-
ity. As it passed nwzt‘, Stoicislrt rose
—‘not a. religion, but a. great philosoA
MIL—Which Dr. Osborne character-
ized as one of the greatest attempts
of the human soul to Come into con-
[act with the unknown powers. stoic-
isln was not emotional, for it put love
and hate, joy and sorrow, on the same
side at the scale. But Stocisnr lures
duced three men whose works, Dr. Os-
borne said, should be on every book-
shelf; these are Seneca, Epictetus,
and Marcus Aurelius.

sinnires l’ersecutions

Stoicism failed because it commenc—
ed with the highbrow element in Ro-
man life. Religion must begin at the
bottom and Work up, and that is one
of the reasons for the final triumph
of Christianity in the Roman emplre.
Surviving eleven great persecutions,
the religion of Jesus finally conquer-
ed, because, according to Gibbon, of
the zeal of the Christians, of the or
ganization of the church, of the HDTV
aculous power of the church, of the
virtuous lives of the Christians and
because at the doctrine of immortal-
ity, It gave woman a, higher place, it
brought respect for children, it
brought in El. tenderness, in philan—
Lumpy, and a. freedom, everywhere.

Jesus was significant in civilization,
continued Dr, Osborne, because
Jesus touched humanity. "The his.
tory of Christianity is written in the
history of biography," concluded the
speaker, in discussing the part Jesus
played in the lives of such men as
Paul, Martin Luther, Loyola, and
Calvin.

’F'nally, Jesus was significant in
civilization because His influence has
never died out. When Christian inor—
als begin to sink, such organizations
as monasticism, scholasttcism. chival-
ry, and finally Puritanism, have come

 

in to raise the standards. Dr. Osborne
was especially concerned with the
three great contributions of Puritan-
ismga free church, a free school, and
a. free town-meeting—all of these the

very essence of our modern democ-l

racy.

Faculty Will Remain
Intact For Next Year

(Continued tram page 1.)

as follows:

Because llllormzltiou ol certain “-0,
posed changes to faculty organization
has come to us, We, the undersigned
students, address the Board of Trus-
toes of Grinnell College:

First, We wish to express our one
preeiation of the signal service tends
el'ed to the college by those members
of the facility who have built their
lives into this institution, itnd Whose
services, we understand. have been
disposed With. We believe that their
sincere and loyal work as teachers
and Its men deserves higher recogni-
tion.

Second, we tour that such action
might prove disastrous by lowering
the traditionally high standards of
Grlnuell, by decreasing the numbers
and the quality of the student bodyi
and by markedly lowering the morale
of both Faculty and students.

Third, we wish to express our hope
that this action may be rescinded or
greatly inodilicd, and. trust the Board
to meet the present crisis by it less
drastic measure.
