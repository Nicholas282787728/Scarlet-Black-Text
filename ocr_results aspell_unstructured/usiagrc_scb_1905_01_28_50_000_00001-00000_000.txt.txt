Harsh in His Criticism olPlagiarism.

During this last month the smaller

will be known in future western ath-
letics as the Northwestern Intercol-
legiate Association. The nieetingwas
held at Yankton, s. D, and delegates
were in attendance from sevelr oi the
colleges. The league will include
South Dakota State University, Da-
kota Wesleyan, Huron College, Red-
ﬁeld College, Yankton College, Mom-
ingside and South Dakota Agriciiltun
al. The :league will be supervised in
much the same iasliion as the “Big
Nine," and will have similar control
over athletics within its lurisdiction

Owing to the recent exposing or a
case or plagiarism at Iowa City. whicir
brings to mind iormer disclosures oi a
similar nature in our western states,
Chancellor Andrews oi Nebraska Uni
versity,in a speech before the students.
made some very forcible expressions
on the deceit practiced in college
work. lie is quoted as saying, “Crib-
bing contains all the essential moral
turpitiidc and business or both steal
ing and lying. Plagiarism is a social
iault. injuring the ivlrole community.
This iault injures the student most or
all,» What are live here [or it not to
learn something? By Handing in
copied work you prevent your instruct-
or from correcting your iaiil . and
thus make advancement impossible.”

Co rderable discussion has been
raise: n regard to the commendable
action or Michigan University over
its barring oi ilalph Rose i’i-orn
athletic competition because at his
disobedience to the rules oi the asso
ciation This praiscworthy action
was taken. although it was known
that Michigan victories were much
endangered.

The legal department of Denver-

University has inaugurated a new
method oi lair practice ior their
seniors. .\ law oiiioe has been opened

these being under the direction or ere
perienccd lawyers.

.v\ vaulting device has been invented
by L, G. Willrins, the Lewis lnstltille
pole» rulter and has been patented by
A. G. Spalding Co. which will
revolutionize indoor vaulting and will
it expectations are run red, allow as
high records to be made there as in
the outdoor sport. It consists of a
hard wood planlr, covered with alreary
plate or irretal and a hard wood block
attached at one end. The vaulter
plants his pole in the metal plate and
itslides to the end block. thus saving
the jar irom the momentum until the
man is in the air, when he gets the
(all beneﬁt oi it and it “shoots him
up” higher than ii he gets the jar
before he leaves the g roun‘d.

IF i WERE KiNG. ,

Chapel Beneﬁt Recital Given Eeiore Good
Audience Last Night at the Colonial
iMrs. Tinn‘n or Her Besr

The presentation of the [our act
drama, ill Were King, as it occurred
last night will always be remember-
on as one or the most enjoy able ens
tertainmen ts ever given in the
Colonial Theatre. The house,
main iluor and balcony, was well lined
with an audience wholly in sympathy
with the spirit at the play. and, much
moretothe point, every one or the
listeners was hilly prepared to hear
productions oi genuine artistic merit.
It is not an exaggeration to say that
no one was disappointed. About one-
hundred and seventy-live dollars will
go totlie chapel fund as a result or the
recital.

In many respects the presentation
or a dramatic masterpiece by a single
artist has advantages over the ordinary
method. ilscinething is lost in the
variety oicostume and in the real sat-
islaction at divining a plot directly
irom its presentation without. the
need or intli ect explanation a corre-
sponding gain is evid nt in the rapid
ity or movement on n'the consist»
ency or interpretation of the dilrcrent
par-ts. To the recital method also
must be assigned the preference be-
cause oitheinterest lent to the plot,
itscli by the very versatility of the
artist. Intliis rcspectl night’s en-
tertainnienr was exceptionally pleas
lug lor the ease with which Mrs. Tin

was a continual revelation to the
audience. She was equally at home

and in that oi the aged and feeble

so an the plot was concerned only in
the love oi her son. All intermediate

patrons ol' the Y. M. c. A. lecture
course. To the dramatist himsell
belongs the credit for making

the h‘ trionic artist is due the praise
ioi- reducing it, to terms which are

Tillllln's presentation was true to the
author and insp' illng the audience.

Not the least of the factors in the

success of the evening was the pleasing

than glad to welcome Mr. lllnCiLrllley's

liberal applause with which he was
greeted. His voice seems to have
gained something over its old time

Mr. Macal‘tiley was ably accompanied

FRIDAYS CHAPEL TALK.

The two familiar illiutdbions ”with
malice toward none and with charity

excellenb little chapel talk by Presi—
dent, Bradley yesterday morning. As
the texts suggest the talk \‘l sdirect-
ed against umnst discrimination or
yilllgement and ng' nst slander and
and magniﬁed suspi ion,

The quality or' yirdgnrent is one
which is constantly iustillcil into
young people. There is always need
or discrimination between good and
bad, true and false. Ill after life the

this truth was vigorously applied to
