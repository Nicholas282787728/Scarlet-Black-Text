Thinclads MeetL Drake Friday

Bulldogs Appear
Strong in Middle,
Long Distance Runs

By J ack Wile.

Gl‘innell’s track team will oppose
the Drake Bulldogs in a dual
meet on Ward field Friday after-
noon, Activities will begin in
both the track and field events at
4 p. m.

This is the first time in sev-
eral years that the Pioneers and
the Bulldogs have met in an out-
door meet. Both teams have
gained in strength during the
season, and should go into Fri-
day's engagement with fairly
even power. Drake placed second
behind the Oklahoma .Aggies in
last Saturday's Missouri Valley
conference meet. Gl'innell took
the second berth behind Coe in
the Midwest conference meet at
Galsburg, 11L, last weekend.

The Bulldogs’ main power lies
in their outstanding middle and
long distance runners. .Lowell
Baal will probably run in both
the half-mile and quarter, He is
this year’s Missouri Valley champ
in the half-mile with a time of
1:58.43 on a muddy track. His
time for the quarter has been
under :50 several times this
spring.

Another Missouri Valley champ,
Allan Dillon from Drake. will be
a hard man to beat in the shot-
put. His winning throw in the
conference meet was 45 feet 7

a fast man in the high and low
hurdles. He won first place in the
lows last Saturday and took sec-
and in the highs,

The best race of the day will
feature Neuman Fell, Grinnell,
and Rasmus, Drake, in the mile.
Fell won first place in that event
at the conference meet with a
time of 41:35.2, but a dry track
should give him a much faster
time.

Harry Barker, Grinnell, set a
new record in the javelin Savor-
day with a throw of 192 feet 10
inches, and also won the discus
event with a toss of 133 feet 3/.
inches. He should have little
trouble in coming out on top in
his division of Friday’s meet.

The Pioneers will also have
strong bids in the sprints with
John Moon taking the spotlight.
