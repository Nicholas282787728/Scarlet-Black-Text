WE WALLOI’ED ’EM!

Last night the Pioneers wailoped
the Coe college aggregation. They not
only walloped them ’but they walked
all over them, and this in a clean,
hard tought game oi which we can all
be proud, it was the ﬁrst chance
that local rooters have had to see the
team in action and to judge for our»
selves as to_its merits. We saw and
we judged—and all with the greatest
satisfaétiimifoi‘ it is a satisfaction
to have a team or which we can boast
——a team that plays the game, win or
lose.

or course we won. In tact, we hope
and expect to keep on winning. With
such teamwork between the players,
and between the supporters of the
Scarlet and Blncir as there was last
night. it would he diiiicult not to win.
And that is only a starter, tor the
pep and enthusiasm will grow as the
season progresses.

We are just opening our season of
home games and we have cight Mis—
souri valley contests here on the home
door. Tuesday night, Missouri, the
much touted leaders or the Conference
will appear here. They have a good
teamein fact they have one of the
best teams of their history. But whztt
dittcrence does that make? No d’ve
men can heat a united group of eight
hundred—and we are united. \Ve have
had a successful start for the homt
season—we expect to “carry on.”

THE ACTIVITY SITUATION

In the several preceding issues at
the Scarlet and Black, editorial disT
cuseion has centered on the absence
rule at present in force, considering
the various phases of the college lire
which it atlects, and discussing the
detects and possible advantage of the
rule. This discussion, of necessity
perhaps, or a matter 0! course, has
undoubtedly tailed to raise any ques—
tions that have not already been con-
sidered by the curriculum coinmittce
and the faculty. Indeed, it would be
an evidence oi decided superiiciality
on the part or the committee if such
were the ease. The entire purpose
of the discussion has been to centraa
lize student views, to show the ems
phasis placed on the question, and to
present, as nearly as possible, all
sides of the situation as it seems to

absences necessitated by

your machine needs cleaning or attention of any kind, bring it to us and we will take care of it for you.

The stand taken on this subjecthao
been, we believe, a temperate one. The
situation has been presented as fairly
as possible, altho thcre can be no
question that the conviction that the
rule is not just and satisfactory is a
dominant motive. True, the absence
rule has ldztd one very desirable res
suit, the enforcement of regular at-
tendance at class. But is that the
junction oi an absence rule? should
it not,
(ions and make provisinu for neces—

r-ather seek to adjust condiv
sary activities that prevent constant
attendance at class. Shouldn’t an ab-
nttcndancc at class? Should notah ab—
sence rule talte into consideration
cases or prolonged illness and or
work tor the College, seeking to en-
courage rather than discourage a slur
dent in his collegiate activities? A
cut systcnr on lines similar to those
now misapplied to absences would bL
highly desirable and would not put a
premium on the elimination oi out—
side acLiVities. Such a change would
meet with the approval and coopera-
tion or the student body and would
necessarily be more successtul than
legislation in direct opposition to the
student interests and inclinations.

The attitude or the student body is
very adequately summed up in the pe-
tition presented to the Curriculum
committee by the student Council, the
toll text or which was printed rn The
Scarlet and Black tor Saturday, Jana
uary 21. This expresses the iceliug
that the present ruling is too string-
ent and that it should be converted
into a cut system instead or holding
its present form, it also ask: that
provision be made for tull exruses tor
recognized
activity wort: or by prolonged illness.
Ii'is to be hoped that some action will
be taken on this petition, which was
Cmphusned by a similar one irom The
Lantern.

or course, the argument that a per—
son abserrt tronr class can not do work
and misses much ot the course is still
advanced. However, the figures rec-
ently announced by the administration
committee prove very cttectually that
this statement does not hold in Crin—
hell. The organization ranlringhigbest
among the girls and the men were
those made up or students engaged in
outside activities. In every case, it
was round that the student who is the
busiest seems to get his work done
more eiiicicntiy than he who has lots
ct time in which to do it.

Under such conditio‘ns, there can be
no need and no advantage in penaliz—
ing the student body tor participation
in outside activities, work that is not
a detriment to scholastic standing but
is an aid to a fuller and better coir

lege lite.

Japanese political and business
leaders have been following the Wash-

deﬁnite ideas as to the disposal of the
money saved by armament reductions.
Raito Fujiyztmzt, president at the Toklo ‘
chamber of commerce, claims that
Japan can save nearly $200,000,000 an—
nually. He advocates that one half of
this be applied (0 the abolition 0f taxes
and the remainder be spent for the
development of industry and the line
movement oi the education system,
more and better schools being estab-
lished.
