The Administra+i<;'l Speaks - -

The Editor of the Scarlet and Black has
recently discussed with me the desirability
of allowing students to smoke in their
rooms in tile quadrangle. This permission
to me seems unwise and undesirable.

During the last four and one—half years
the regulations concerning the use of to~
bacco by our women students have been
radically changed. Four and one»holl' years
ago the women students had a small smoke
lng room in the basement of the quadrangle
which they could use if they desired to
smoke ill the college buildings. Otherwise
it was necessary for them to go out onto
the street. This situation was changed, and
smoking rooms were provided in each of
the cottages. Recently smoking in the dill-
lng room has been permitted, and students
have been allowed to smoke on the campus
without criticism. The college administra»
tion has gone further in liberalizing the
smoking rules than many people have
thought wise, but these steps have been
taken in the interest of the convenience
of the students and because it seemed to
be an honest way to deal with the situation.

The decision that no smoking should be
permitted in the students' rooms has been
made on the basis of a survey of student
opinion and serious conferences with stu-
dent leaders, housemothers, and other ad<
ministrative officials. The majority of the
students are not in favor of permitting
smoking in their rooms. There is an almost
unanimous agreement on the part of the
college administrative officers and house
mothers that the quadrangle will be better
off if smoking is limited to the smoking
rooms. The majority of the student leaders
do not believe that it is in the best interests
of the student body as a whole for our
present regulations to be changed.

In a democracy we ought to be willing
to abide by the opinion of the majority.
No minority group should want its de ' es
or judgments to take precedence over the
wishes of the larger body of opinion. It
seems, therefore, that the girls who con-
tinue to agitate for a change in our present
smoking regulations should cease and de—

sist. They have an ample opportunity to
smoke as much as they desire to in rooms
set apart for the purpose. They should not
selfishly insist upon being permitted to folr

. low their particular wishes and desires when

the majority of their fellow students have
expressed a contrary opinion.

The administration does not believe that
it is being either arbitrary or backward in
its refusal to give serious considel tion to
the proposal that we further liberalize our
smoking regulations.

A Fifty-fifty Chance - - .7

In any form of gambling—whether it be,

playing the races, betting on cards, or any-
thing elscione stands a frity-fltty dance
of winning.

In writing this editorial, we stand no
chance of “winning,” since the administra-
tion has already determined the path it
will follow. Nevertheless, believnig Strongly
in progression, we “take our chance" un-
dauntedly.

The administration submits that chang-
ing the smoking regulatlo t: is the wish of
‘ minority and that they should desist
in their plea in favor ol‘ the majority. We
do not believe that the question of smoking
in our rooms is con lied with either a
majority or a minority
smoke will not be of acted by changing
this regulation. It is hardly probable that
it' they disapproved g 'ls would enter their
rooms to smoke. If it became a roommate
problem, as would seldom happen, blen
surely the girls are capable of working it
out between themselves. Such a situation
might well occur when two girls share an
apartment outside of college.

Ventilation could also be remedied easily.
The problem of airing out a room in which
one or two girls have been smoking inter-
mittently is not comparable to that of ven-
tilating a room constantly crowded with
smokers. As for the fire hazard, the ma-
jority of those who smoke do so in their
own homesiand parents are strangely
averse to having cigarettes stamped ont on
rugs, etcetera.

The survey taken last year to determine ,

student opinion on this subject was inade-
quate. Many of the questions were mlS-
leading in their phrasing. This was a com—
mon complaint at the time. Thus, the an
swers given could easily have been misA
interpreted. '

We challenge the statement that the
majority of student leaders are averse to
changing the smoking regulations. The
president of the student council and many
of the league board members are strongly
supporting the ”forward move”—surely
these are the top ranking student leaders.

In a democracy we should progress, or
stagnation will set in. We do not feel that
we are being selfish in asking that serious
consideration begiven this question. We do
feel that the smoking regulations are not in
keeping with the times.

A gambler is prepared to win or losei
all he asks is a fifty-fifty chance.

Haitie's Oswald - -

lBy Stuart Roctler
l

,Rcmember me? I’m Oswald, the
llittle character that was the
guest of honor at the theater
party night before last. I felt
like talking turkey, cause rm
going to lose my head one of
these days, so rm shipping this
gobble gab from my cagey little
domicile In Hcincs basement.

I was mighty nice of you folks
to give me that great big to-do
Wednesday night. 1 can sit here,
,and recollect the whole thing just
jlike as it it were happening now.
1 About 9:15 I and my little
cage were put in the foyer of
the Strand theater, and Gerry
Ross gave me a few final a‘fr
fcctionnte pats, Thcn around 9:30
they started to let the mob, that“
lmd accumulated outside of the
‘doors, come into the theater.
Students, faculty members, evV
,‘crybody stopped and gaped at
‘me and said “poor Oswald.” I
agreed with them very thoroughly.

 

In fact. so thoroughly, that I ine , _

dignnntly chewed the finger at a
s a 13 reporter wllo was trying
to prod me into giving him an
interview for the college paper. 1
. 1 was simply ecstatic over Lhat‘
luscious picture all about my‘
,cousins in the animal kingdom.
lThe animal babies seemed to
‘please most everybody, I noticedl
:1 firmly resolved lievor to play‘
Ithc horses again, especially when
ll round out that they ran mol‘e‘
Ethan one horse in a race, so you‘
couldirt be too sure your horse}
would win.

But now, this picture Laura,
that was enough to give even
a turkey goose pimples, and I
ain’t kidding. This more or less'
,sneak previewilt was the rim
'showing of the picture in the
state of Iowa~nlade Grinnelrs fe-
male sophisticates squirm like a
bunch of high school girls. Even
some of those hard to please up»
,per class Pnietrce residents were
lsomewhat emotionally uprooted
. at least it was a good’
excuse to hold "her” hand while
walking home.

It really isn’t necessary to say
much about this scary Tierney
flicker because if you saw it
you'll not need to have it re-
freshed, and if you didn't I don‘t
want to spoil it for you when
you do see it, .

However, my name should be
Queenie, cause the height of the
evening was when out 1 tripped.

several girls nearly passed out
when they discovered they had
torn up their raffle tickets in the
course of the evening. Tuff.

“225“ . . . “225" . . , that is
the winning number.”

A typical Hattie Cook squeal
floated back from the first rows,
”ooooohhhhhHI-IHHHHHH!” Her
date for the evening, Uncle Bill
Hoskins, just let his lower jaw
drop almost clear to the
floor.

While poor Hattie was mumbl-
ing: “What the 11... am I going
to do with him?”, Uncle Bill just
drooled at me and. muttered
“Buddie . . . Buddie . . . BUD-
