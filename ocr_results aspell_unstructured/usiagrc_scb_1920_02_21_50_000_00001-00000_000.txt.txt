REVISED DANGE ‘
RULES GIVEN UUT
BY COMMITTEES

Articles Two and Three
Recent Additions
to List.

, The revised regulations governing
dancing Were announced today by the

Social Committee of the faculty acting
in connection with the Recreational
Committee.

There is little change in the regula—
tions tram lost year with the excep-
tion of two articles in the list of rules.

Articles two and three are the two
new ones in the list. Article two
states that “dancing will be permitted
at a general recreational period, the
details of which shall be worked out
by a joint committee of the faculty and
students." This committee is the one
now known as the recreational coma
mittee. Further statements are made
as to the timo‘and place the recrea—
tional hours are to be held, and urges
that they be characterized as inlormal.

Article Three New.

Article three makes provision for at~
tendance of students at town dances
and reads as follows: "Regular dances
of town organizations may be attended
only with special permission and such
special permission shall include no ex-
tension ct time "

The other articles make provision
for the regular all college dances, six
in number, and speoiiy that "no col-
lege organization of group of students
may arrange a dance either in Crin—
hell or outside of Grinurll during the
college year.” Article ﬁve. the last,
is the one that makes it unlawful to
attend public dances.

Avoid Special Privileges.

The committee stated in publishing
the rules that in adopting the plans
for a general: recreational period to
include dancing, it was hoped that all
the desirable features of dancing
could he incorporated, and the disadr
vantages of special social privileges

' f the student body could
for E Damon D lyel'iods that were played,

be avoided. It was also hoped that
these concessions would entirely clini—
nate the attendance at public dances.

The rules, together with 8. supple-
mental‘y statement, are printed on the
editorial page of this issue.

Would Stop Stalling
In Football Games

There will be no stalling in football
games of the lnture. if a proposed
new ruling is adopted at the approach-
ing meeting of the football rules coma
mittee, according to an articlc in the
Chicago Tribune of Feb. 28. Statistics
recently compiled show a wide varia-
tion in the number of plays run off
in even the biggest games of the coun»
try, where the best rcferccing and
umpi ng are to be had. The number
runs (ram 110 to 190 in these games.

Hence the suggestion is matlu that
a dctlnitc number of plays say 40, be
made each quarter, thus giving both
teams an oven chance to score, and
preventing the side counting ﬁrst from
holdiun their opponents at their mercy
by increasing tbc time bctwrcn each
play, The plan has boon prosouted
by Hurry it. Coffin, a l-larvard crad—
uatc, and has the approval of Walter
Camp, Percy D. Haughtou and other
expert football critics on the country.

STAHLE RAGE

Chance at Fifth Position in M. V.
Race — Three More Games
On Schedule.

With but three games remaining on
the 1920 ha. ctball schedule of the
Pioneers, the Criuneil baskotecrs have
a chance to become state champions.
The Pioneers battlc Drake at Des
Moiues Tuesday. and Allies at Amos
Saturday in the last two Missouri Val—
ley Copter-once contests this year, and
play the ﬁnal game of the season with
Cornell here Friday, March 5.

With the exception of the is to 11
Drake victory on the Gi'ihnell court
several weeks ago, not a quintet in
the state has defeated the PiollCCi‘s.
Dubunuo college is said to have one
of the sti'ousl‘bl. lives in iowa this
year, but that team has been defeated
once. Drake and Cornell have-both
been defeated bl other colleges in1
Iowa. Should Giiniiell cop the last
three games of the 1920 season, Lhei
college can at least lay claim to the‘
slate honors. ‘

As a result or last nights 13 to 12
Amos victory, the Pioneers are now
in seventh position in the ill souri
Valley Conlcronce standings. A viC-
tory Tuesday night will put Gl'iiihell
ahead of Oklahoma, and should the
Pioneers cop the return game with
Amos Saturday} the team will prob-
ably end the season in ﬁfth place:
with Drake, Oklahoma and Amos ﬁll-
ing Lhe lower berths of die final con—
ference standing.

The Cornell team, which closes the
local 1920 college basketball season
on the Pioneer court March 5, is a
fast quintet, it being composed of
such experienced veterans as Hoedley,
Sanderson, Hul'lhill't, Lemon and Kep—
ler. The team opened the season with
three consecutive victories over the’
Iowa University team, and has made
a good showing in all games played
since then.

of interest to tans who have followed

The editor greeted us with‘ that
tangible something in his looks which

Ames is shoved into the cellar posi-
tion in the Valley Conference.

The ﬁrst half was remarkably slow,
neither team getting started until the
second period. Ames failed to get
a ﬁeld goal in the ﬁrst half, but got
two out of seven foul throws. Crinucll
