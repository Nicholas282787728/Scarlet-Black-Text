ence Wednesday Evening by
Its Intensity ¥ Both Played
By Good Companies.

The United Play company prcseuted
Chas. Klein’s iamous play, ”The Th ~d
Degree," to a full house at the Colonial
last night. The play is directed
against the sweat-box method oi extort-
ing contesslons from those suspected
of crime, and also was replete with the
absolute devollon of womanly love.
These two major objecs work against
each other to a. certain extent, and (lis-
sipate the feeling oi unity which ought
to be present in dramalle writing. The
drama can deal with the abstract only
by embodying it in some concrete c.
ample. The play goei- feels that ii
the play is going to do the most cltcc-
tive work against third dcgrce meth-
ods, Captain Clinton ought to be con.
ironted in open court with the villain

and which havc been greatly enjoyed,
by many. Protessor Matlack's pro-
gram on Wednesday was up to thc
usual high average. it was opened by
two Bach numbers, the ﬁne “Prelude
and Fugue in A minor” and Meditation
on the Chorale, “Jesu Leiden, Feiii iind
Tod," The dainty melody of Mao
Dow-en's “Nautilus" formed a pleasing
contrast and Guilmhnt's “Pastoralc
and Finale trom the Sonata in D
minor, Op. 42" iormed a good closing
number. Prolessor iiatiack was heard
at his best and brought out to the hill
the capabilities of the great instrnr

solit “The other Fellow” at the Cola.

nlal, Thirteen of lhe host amateur

thcspians the University ailords will
take part in the production,
"The other Fellow." is an excellent

comedy, full or nation and bubbling
over with the humor of inuuiiierahle
iuiiny situations. It is the lad or
play that amateurs can act with tips
proximately as much success as proles
sionals because it deals with the bright
side at lile and is ﬁlled with action
The play has back at it a record at
long and successful runs in Chicago
and New York, and has been heraldod
as one or the best comedies at late
years,

“CHASE FOR A CHASE”
PROVES INTERESTING

Professor A. B. Hart Tells Hume
boldt Society How He Gained
Information In Regard to Sal-
mon P. ChaseaMdny H92! Kim.

"A Chase [ul‘ fl Chase" was the title

at Professor A. B. Hart’s Humboldt
society lecture on Wednesday evening.
There had been a great deal oi specilr
lation as to just what this rather at
tractire and mysterious title would rc-
vcal, but the explanation was simple
when it was revealed that the second
chase reie ed to in the title was the
notcd Ame can Salmon P. Chase. In
other words, Professor liart simply
planned to relate some of his expel-i
enees in securing iniormation about
Mr Chase, when he startcd to‘investle
gate the career of that gentleman,
The story at his experiences along this
line was most interesting. When he
sgtarted out, he had no idea that lie
was beginning anything diiticult. The
man was so well known and his c.»
l'eer had been so prominent that he
supposed the material would lie ready
to his hand, hut he soon iouiid that
this was lar from the case, It was
not until he had devoted much timc
and encrgy and C\liailstcd any source
oi information that "it Chase ior n
Chase" was ended.

have been close and in many cases the
ﬁnal score has been more the result of
chance than or any superior playing
on the part ol the winning team.

The season opencd with a double
game between the Juniors and Seniors,
and the Freshmen arid Sophomores.
The ﬁrst game was very onersided, re-
suiting in a score or 16 to 2 in iavor
