Eugene McCarthy examines his political career

by [aura Carter with Eric Weiss

Was Eugene McCarthy the same man
politically, when, during 318 19605 and
19705 he ran for president as the voice of
opposition to the established system and
then when he endorsed Ronald Reagan in ‘
the 1930 presidential election? “Sure I
am,” answered the former senator. “I
always was rational.“

McCarthy, who served Minnesota’s
fourtlricongressional district for in years
before his terms as senator from 19594970,
described this rationality as being able to
“look at the picture, understand what
could happen, see what is happening, and
make some decisions." These abi ties
helped him secure support in the presiden-
tial elections of i966, 1972 and 1976, and his
most recent attempt tor public office, an
unsuccessful bid in the September, i982
Democratic primary to regain his Senate
seat.

The 1968 presidential campaign first
gained McCarthy national attention. “We
didn't start out thinking we had any
chance to win, but we thought the issue of
opposition to the war in Vietnam had to be
raised, plus some related issues such as
the imperial presidency and the arbitrary
power of presidents over foreign policy."

Before we primaries, McCarthy recall-
ed, polls showed that nearly 12 percent of
the voting public supported his candidacy.
By the beginning of the Democratic Con»
vention in August, polls predicted he could
defeat Richard Nixon by eight percentage
points, while Vice President Hubert Hum-
phrey, the eventual nominee, trailed Nixon
by one point.

McCarthy offered two reasons for his
failure to secure the nomination. FOIIOWr
ing his strong showing in the early New
Hampshire primary, where he received 42
percent of the vote, behind the write-in vic-
tory of President Lyndon Johnson, who
was not in the race: “Robert Kennedy
came in, and it was his judgement that we
had a chance to win, which he didn’t want.
He wanted it to happen for him, not for
me."

Because the anti-war constituency was
divided between the two men, their
primary battles became the central issue
and the McCarthy campaign ”didn't have
either time or money to work on the non
primary states very well." After
Kennedy's assasination, many of his sup

, porters turned to Humphrey and Senator
George McGovern, instead of McCarthy,

Former U

McCarthy did not support Humphrey un-
til late in the campaign, because “he didn’t
really deserve our endorsement, he was
for the war. We held out on him because
Johnson was after him all the time to
maintain his position for the war.” Accor-
ding m McCaruiy, “there wasn’t a single
study that showed my late endorsement”
contributed to Nixon's election.

News Proﬁle

During the 1972 election, McCarthyrais-
ed several issues before the Democratic
Party which were not included in its plat-
form. Chief among these was me need to
create a policy to deal with the impending
energy crisis, and the need to reevaluate
the waste in America’s “automobile
culture " He also proposed at this time a
new program to eliminate institutionalized
unemployment through alr'edistrlbution of

Black History Mont/9
emphaszzes acbzevement

by Laura McDermith

Most college campuses, according to
Director of Minority Affairs Laveta Small,
have traditionally hosted a black history
week or month, and Grinnell is currently
holding such an event. The celebration is
designed for the entire community,

Small said support for the event, which
is sponsored by one Office of Minority Afr
fairs, has been strong. “The students are
too percent wim me,“ she said. So far, ac
cording to Small, attendance at events has
been good,

This month‘s program concentrates on
the achievements of blacks in education,
religion, civil rights, government, the per
forming arts and social structures. Accorr
ding to Small, these areas of concentration
were chosen because of their historical
significance and because these are the
areas “where blacks have really been
allowed to achieve the most.”

For example, blacks have been involved
in education for a long time because there
was a need for “black educators to educate
blacks." Small stressed that other fields,
such as economics, literature and science,
are equally important, but not as ap
plicable to her criteria.

The people Small wrote about in the
Black History Monﬂi booklet are those who
are pioneers in their fields, including the
guest speakers who will come to Grinnell
to participate in the event,

Sunday, Feb. 13, at 10:30 a.m., the
Reverend James Jones of Des Moines,
along with a 40 member choir, will lead a

worship service in Herrickvchapel. The ‘

Reverend Lonnie Jordan of Waterloo was
originally scheduled for this event but was
forced to cancel at the last minute,

Howard Rabinowitz will be the convocar
tion speaker next Thursday at 11 am. in
Herrick. There was a small lnix»up when
the Black History Month booklet was
printed, and Rabinowitz was listed under
the introduction “'i‘wo Blacks who have
studied and written about interracial
working relationships. . " Although
Rabinowitz has certainly studied the topic
extensively, Small pointed out that he is,
however, not black.

On Feb. 15, the black community will
host a student variety show. The Young,
Gifted, and Black Choir will be perform-
ing, and original poetry. songs and dances
will be presented. This show is dedicated
to the black martyrs.

A Black History Awareness Quiz styled
after the old “College Bowl'I will be held at
l p.m. Saturday, Feb. 26 in South Lounge.
Representatives from University of Iowa,
Coe College and Grinnell College will com-
pete for points awarded for correct
answers to questions about black history.

Black History Month will become an an
nual event at Grinnell. Black Cultural
Weekend will still be held because of its
history at Grinnell but will be much
smaller with the emphasis shifted to the
month-long celebration. Black Martyr's
Weekend will also be celebrated. but Small
would rather emphasize the positive
aspects of black.history rather than the
deauis of its martyrs. . r . . , .

and federal election laws, he entered the
l976 presidential race, In addition, he
wanted to provide an alternative to Jimmy
Carter and Gerald Ford, whose positions
he found remarkably similar. “If you look
at the debates between Carter and Ford,
the 23 minutes of silence was the high point
of the campaign,” McCarthy remarked.
Although his candidacy had only a small
impact, he was able to challenge state
laws and secure a spot on 30 state ballots
and have the Supreme Court review the

'Federal Election Act of 1975. McCarthy

Called the court's decision “a mixed rul-
ing," and showed that the controversy
over the status of independents continues
with the case currently being contested by
John Anderson, an independent in the 1980
election.

Anderson is trying to redefine the
eligibility of independents to receive
public funds during their campaigns in-
stead of having to wait until the election
results prove them to be Viable candidates,

In the 1980 campaign, McCarthy surpris~
ed political observers by supporting
Ronald Reagan. “You couldn't have any
intellectual integrity and support Carter »
he was too dumb. He didn’t know what the
issues were, everything he said was
nonsense."

Carter’s plan to reduce federal
bureaucracy resulted in the creation of
two new departments, and “he dlsorganiz~
ed the whole government,” uie former
senator said. He added, “you have to be
responsible. Carter was completely ruin-
ing the economy. You can say ‘stop it' with
someone like Reagan, but you don’t stay
there."

About his unsuccessful Senate bid last
fall, McCarthy said, “I had people back in
the state who said, ‘You've got to do it once
more.’ " Although he received one-third of
the primary vote, he did not have the sup-
port of the party or of labor. His opponent
Mark Dayton, who spent $3 million
through the general election, “improved
on the Rockefeller technique of buying an
office," McCarthy said, by spending the
previous few years buying Minnesota's
Democrat-rarm-Labor party.

McCarthy also commented on current
domestic and international issues As a
former professional educator, he stated,
“I think the state of education is doing all
right. People expect too much,"

Although he did not take a definite stand
on financial aid cuts, he said, “You can

argue around the edges that there is too
much aid, that people could do more
themselves. But I'd much rather see them
spend money on education than build
highways."

On the issue of nuclear arms. McCarthy
stated a need for agreements not to fire
missiles, as opposed to a nuclear freeze.

Citing present agreements between the
United Smtes and the Soviet Union not to
fire missiles in the South Pole, in develop»
ing nations, in space or under the oceans,
he said, “if we now exempt Europe, that
would mean that the only target areas left
would be Russia and die United States and
maybe China. So if we could get an agree-
ment to exempt China, there would only be
Russia and the United States and we might
agree not to bomb each other ”

He continued, “We have done it the back
way. But if Reagan moves to that, it's
much more important to me than any
agreement on new nuclear missile
technology."

Small fire
damages Haines

by irene Weisrnehl

A small fire broke out on l-laines second
last Sunday. Feb. 6. at about 10:30 p.m.,
according to second floor resident Coleen

Lamm. The worst damage from the fire

' was a small hole burned in the new carpet.

The fire was definitely an accident, said
Hall President Peter Hautzinger, He is
confident that vandalism was not involved
John Houllhan noticed smoke rising from
the cardboard box used as a garbage pail
in the hall and attempted to extinguish it,
according to Lamm. l-loulihan was
unavailable for comment, Hall residents,
who extinguished the fire, were forced to
use water from the bathrooms as the box
was in front of the second floor eXc
tinguisher. Although a student did retrieve
the extinguisher from the first floor, Haute
zinger noted that the fire was out before
the extinguisher arrived.

The situation was initially complicated
by an oversensitlve fire alarm. l-lautzinger
explained that the alarm had been set off
every time someone used the oven. “i
didn’t realize it was an actual fire until so-
meone yelled ‘flre’," he said.

Diversity series to increase
student tolerance

by Ken Scollon

One of the best parts of a college ex
perience can be gained by meeting people
who are from different backgrounds. But
to benefit from this experience it is impor-

- [ant to have an open mind and be able to

accept values and opinions different from
your own;

These ideas of diverSity and tolerance
are among the biggest boasts that the
Grinnell environment has to offer, But
even here, where the flame burns hot
underneath this melting pot of diverse per-
sonalities, separate social groups do
develop and consequently intolerance does
exist.

Focusing on the reasons why this in
tolerance does develop and how it can be
circumvented is the purpose of the on.
going Diversity Series sponsored by the
Office of Student Affairs.

In the words of one of the organizers,
Anita Close, the series is aimed at getting
people “to accept others and to be tolerant
of their differences and to learn to ap-
preciate those dilierencs which are the
reason that Grinnell is as diverse as it is.”

One can become closed-minded about
his open-mindedness. Although a con-
tradiction in terms, it can explain why
perhaps you cannot understand your “less
liberal" neighbor who spends a lot of her
time putting on makeup, or who voted for
Reagan in the last election.

“People need to look at themselves to
see if Grinnell has as much open-
mindedness as ﬂiey wouldlike to believe,”
commented Close. She «encourages

 

students to attend the Diversity Series to
“examine the boundaries of one's own
tolerance."

The series consxsls of live presentations
and discussions, two of which have already
been presented The first of these was a
film entitled From Harlem to Harvard
which was shown last Tuesday, The film
focused on a black student who was having

’trouble adapting to the pressures and

changes that attending Harvard entails

Still to come, next Thursday a student
and alumni panel will discuss the topic of
“Why 7 Athletics at Grinnell." The panel
will be talking about why there is a gap
between athletes and the general student
body at Grinnell and how this gap can be
bridged. This discussion will take place in
Younker Hall Lounge at 9 pm.

A week from Tuesday, Feb. 22, the
animated film, The Fable of He and She
will be shown in South Lounge at 9 pm. its
sponsors hope the film will prompt discus
sion afterwards on its topic: the different
roles people adopt in society.

still to be scheduled is a panel discussion
made up of Grinnell faculty and staff who
have either been here since the 19st or
were students on campus then. From these
experiences they will describe changes
they have seen in students and attitudes on
campus. They will answer questions about
how the levels of diversity and tolerance of
today's campus community compare with
those of years past. The date for this
discussion is set for sometime in early
March.
