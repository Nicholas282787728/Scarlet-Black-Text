Six Characters in Search of an
Author challenges the conven-
tions of traditional theatre

BV DAVID MONTGOMERV

It’s not a typical play practice.

The actors are nnnoyedThe director is losing his
patience. There are complaints about the set and the
concept of the play is in dispute. To make matters
worse, a crucial character is nowhere to be foundThis
particular night, with two weeks left to go before Six
converters In semi/r qftm Arum is performed, there
might be cause to worry. Fortunately, the director is
not Adrian Schriel, a Switzerlandebased thespian
who is guest directing Six Char-mm. It’s Mark Gar-
diner ‘05, whose character's plans for a mundane day
ofhashing out a new play have been thrown into dis-
array. The entire rehearsal scene is part of the second
act of set cant/term, a classic lralian play being per
formed on October 8, 9, and 10 in Roberts Theatre.

Luigi Pirandello‘s Six Chamztm is about a play
withineaeplay, and this is only the ﬁrst of the many
curveballs he lobs at audiences.Thc play was ground»
breaking when first written in 1921, and remains so
today. In Six Cir/Willie”, an acting troupe’s practice
session is interrupted by six characters from an an
ﬁnished play, who demanding that the actors act out
their unﬁnished story

These characters are unique because they were
created out of an author's imagination rather than be-
ing born and growing up. In the characters' desire to
become complete, to bring their drama to the coli-
clusion that their original author did not write, they
force the “real" actors, as well as the audience,to come
to grips with the degree to which they themselves are
characters

Gardiner’s Director holds the pllly together. “I
serve as the principal point of contact between the
Cast and the Characters," he said, “but also as the
point ofcontact between the audience and the play.“
The Director often stands oh the sragc, among the
audience. This positioning emphasizes his similarity
with the audience, while the rest ofrhc actors remain
on the stage.

Accotding to Schliel, this sort of staging is vely
important With this play in particular. “The stage
composition is a critical part of the play," he said.
“With so many different realities in the show, we have
to make sure the audience can discern individual ,6,
alities.” The positioning ofchniacters, the costumes,
and other technical features all assist the actors in
presenting these realities to the audience.

Two key roles, Brian Fritsch ‘06 as the Father and
Dale Mackey '07 as the Stepdnnghter, dominate the
Characters.These two are at the heart ofthc action
or the character-s plilyrwithiirarplay. They tend on
stage with each other and the Director in an attempt
to present the conﬂict from their point orview The
Father and Stepdaughter are vivid characters, limited
in scope by the “author" who did not ﬁnish writing
them but still passionate about their experiences.The

stepdaughter laughs incredulously as a pompous
Leading Lady (Rebecca Mauldtn '05) attempts to
replicate her shame on stage. It is not that the Lead
ing Lady does a poorjobiit is that even through the
mouthpiece of the best per-former, the original event
becomes something different.

Other characters include the Son, Nicholas Blen-
cowe ‘08. He provides an unexpected moral compass,
by refusing to participate in the Father’s plan to stage
the unﬁnished play “I feel that my character is the
victim in the show," he said. “[The Son] thinks that
the act of displaying the family's tragedy publicly is
shameful,"

Jayn Bailey ‘05 is the grieving mother who wears
on her face and in her slumped shoulders all the pain
and suffering the six characters have endured. She,
with the son, anchors the characters in humanity,
passive-aggressively challenging the determination
of the Father and Stepdaughter to put on the play.

The ﬁnal two characters are the Boy and the
Child. The Boy (Mitchell Parks '08) does not talk.
“it’s a very challenging otperience to stand for the
entire play, not speaking," Parks said. “It takes an en
tirely new form of concentration.” Stealing the en-
tire show, however, is the charming performance of

Fun facts: Luigi
Pirandello

St The Sicilian playwright’s ﬁrst marriage was ar-
ranged with a woman he didn't know. She soon
went insane,

5i Pirandello wrote extremely proliﬁcally. His ﬁrst
three plays each took less than a week to write? his
two most famous, “Six Characters" and ”Henry IV",
were both completed in one five-week period.

4. El Dupe, Benito Mussolini, gave Pirandello ext
tensive support. Pirandello professed allegiance to
fascism, but one of his later plays may be a veiled
attack on this ideology.

3. Late in life, Pirandello became romantically in-
volved with an actress, Marta Abba. He wrote most
of his later plays speciﬁcally for her.

2. Before he died, Pirandello was in the middle of
negotiations to appear in a ﬁlm version of ”Six
Characters”.

1. Pirandello wrote this about his funeral requests:
”When I am dead, do not clothe met Wrap me naked
in a Sheet. No flowers on the bed and no lighted
candle. A paupei’s cart. Naked, And let no one ac—
company me, neither relatives or friends. The cart,
the horse, the Coachmen, e basta, Burn me." Must
solini gave him an elaborate state funeral.

young Maggie LeVandoskl as the Child. “She's four
years old, and about this tall," said assistant director
Chris deBree ‘05, holding his hand our level with the
forehead Of'llic squatting stage manager, Saul Stiohn
‘06.Togerher with her stuffed beal Chocolate, she ex-
udes charisma and a natural stage presence, Maggie is
the daughter ofProfessor Levandoskl.

Even with the Child onstage, the acting troupe
in Six CImmrfers doesn't put together a terribly good
show by the end of the play. The challenges that they
face, however, when performed by schriel's actors, are
a delicious philosophical puzzle. Pirandello meant to
challenge his audiences with Six Cbarﬂztil'x, and this
English version more than delivers the goods.
