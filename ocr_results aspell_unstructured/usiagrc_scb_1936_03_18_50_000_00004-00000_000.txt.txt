A FIGHT To THE FINISH!

makIug capItal of “the old tradition that prepared-
ness prevents war” to hasten the drIve toward a
blggcr and better war,

The pahIctccr iIncludIng, we trust, Mr. Dernﬁ
have not forgotten the InstItIItIons of higher learn-
Ing To date more than 200 campuses have found a
place for the Reserve Officers’ TI ail-ling corps, An-
other hundred are expected to add mithIy Lraininv
to their curricula In the near future. in 118 inst'
lutIous of lcarnIng drill Is not only cllcrcd but ler
quired.

Scunlor Nyc of North Dakota and Representative
Kvnlc cl ancsola have introduced a bill intended
to clImiuatc conscription from American cducsucu
The bill would amend the National Defense act of
1916 mm the stipulation that no R. o. T. c. unit
be approved at miy school or college “until such
institution shall hnvc satisfied the secrctst of Wm
that emollmenl III such unit {except III thc case of
essentInuy thlaI-y schoolsl is elective and not com-
pllisory.” Mild as it uutv appear. consonant with
thc democratic idea as it Is, Ihc Nye Kvalc bill is
by no means assured of passagc.

No sooner did the campaign against militarism
III caucaticu bchn to assume formidable proportIons
than spokesmen [or “national defense" rushed for
word with cuphemisms curl counter-charges. The
R, o T, c. was a higher form of “physical cducnr
tIou : the goose-step was "character education”,
compulsory drill was IIcIIizcnship training," :In antI.
(lotc for the subvcrsive agitation of students who
fclt. and spill, that was unnecessary and futIle and
they would have ucthing to do with It.

It; means little to the dcfcndeI-s of the R. o. T. C,
that the best minds In the field of physical education
have characterized as a hollow falsehood the claims
that (ll-ill “builds men." .

It is irrelevant to the apostles of chauviuism that.
the kind of "character" developed by the corps Is
otherwise known as the "military mind" \vhicha
Prof. Reinhold Niebuhr once stalelli”m:lkes uni
IhlnkIng obedience the summum bonum in the hier-
archy of virtues ..

It. is not. at all alarming to the super-patriots that
"citizenship” as promoted In the R. o. T, c. has
meant the negation of science and democracy, that
the training corps have been as culpable as any
group In the revival of American college vigilan-
tism,

What that "éitizenship" implies was once Illus-
trated in an official R o. T. c, manual (withdrawn
from circulation, thanks ,to student protests, 10
years ago), One passage rcad: “This inherent der
sire to fight and kill must be carefully watched for
and encouraged by the student . .. And further:
“To finish an opponent whc hangs on or attempts to
pull you to the ground, always try to break his hold
by driving the knee or fact to his crotch and gong»
ing his eyes with your thumbs,”

"Citizenship," indeed!

As it becomes Increasingly apparent that the na-
tlcu's mIlIIcry machine is being geared to the IIIevI-
labIlIly If not the early desirability of another war,
student protests against militarism and the socIcty
which breeds It wIll he Increasingly vocal. At the
same time. R o T. c units will crop up on campus-
es which never had military tIcInIng before. The
corps already established will emerge more clearly
as stol'mrtmops of bogus “Americanism,” intolerr
ance, antI ntelleutualism. They are strongholds of
reactIon today: they may be the vanguards of fas-
cism tomorrow.

WIde public support for the Nye-Kvale bIll may ‘

not signify the bchnning of the end [or the R 0
T 0 But it. will prevent fuither cxplllsions of
students who, on rcligIcus or political grounds, re»
'fusc to submit to compulsory drill. More Important,
it will attract: public attention to what has long
been an antisocial feature of our educational system
and today Is an Incubator of forccs winch may sIIne
day destroy our civilization,

The campaign should not be conﬁned to those
schools \vhele compulsory R, o. T. c. exists. Thc
menace of jiugolsm cannot be isolated. Every sell-
alor, every representative in Congress should be
llotlfied, deluged with petitions, hounded until such
time as he places his iuflucncc behind the bill.

It. is encouraging that. the tremendous growth of
the n. o. T. C. since the war has not occurred with-
out artIlIcIal stimulation, Although the cavalry
wcnt out of style and utility after Appomatox,
thousands of borscs have been piovided as sugar
chIug for the pill of compulsory training. For-
tunes have been spent on flashy uniforms, Pretty
gIIls have bccu recruited as "sponsors." The enemy
has been resourceful.

Therc is going to be a fight to the finish bclwccu
a strong student peace movement and a highly-
subsiaized regiment of training for slaughter. The
outlook will he more reassuring once the Nye-Kvale
bIll Is kuv.
