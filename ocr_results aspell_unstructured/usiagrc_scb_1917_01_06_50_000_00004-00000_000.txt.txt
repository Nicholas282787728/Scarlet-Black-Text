‘AMEHIBA NEEDS POETS’
SAYS Ill-l. E. A. STEINEH

Noted Illlllii ion _ llllo V Takes
“1le it Sliillt 0i Colnpeti loui
“Physical Tr illg Should De-
‘CIOD Cooperation."

“Just as the world waited for the
continent which Columbus revealed.
the world today is waiting for a new
America." This was the statement of
Dr. Steiner to yesterday's chapel audi~
ence. “This new America,” the speaks

‘ or continued, “must interpret nation-

ztlisnl in a new way, not as it has been
construed by Eurupe—selllsh, grasps
ing, and representative only of power.“

Conceding that the United States is
a nation, a political unit, “whose state
lines, to the 0:15qu traveler" he re-
rhsrked, “are noticed only by his abil-

_ ity to secure a divorce or a drink,"

he proceeded to outline four chal‘ae»
toristics of true nationality which/are
in our commonwealth.
They are a good economic loundalion,
social cohesion, a well constructed cd-
ucalional program, and a sense of na-
tional idealism.

”Whether we like it or not,“ Dr.
Steiner insisted, “patriotism rests on
an economic foundation." Then, in (llS’
cussing a lack 0i social cohesion, he
declared, “We are clthcr one people or
we are nothing."

Dr. Steiner condemned the American
public school system, granting that it
commands one or the most ctlicicnt
teaching forces in the world, as ”not
a system but a chaos." Our chlldren,"
he continued, "arc the unhappicst in
the world, fur true happiness consists
in doing oue's Work, and doing it
well."

“The spirit or competition, in Amer»
ion, is already too highly developed,”
was his asscrtion, “and we need now
to cultivate some form of ph~ ical
trainlng for our youth which will der
velop cooperation, not competition."

Dr. Steiner emphasized u need for
idealism with a quotation from Bryce
~“Amei‘icﬂ. needs poets,” and he add-
ed, "Our glee clubs have lmmortalizcd
'Allna ilatcr,’ but not the iathcrland."

“We are in want," he concluded, "oi
a great natlcnal passion [or schlcc.”
