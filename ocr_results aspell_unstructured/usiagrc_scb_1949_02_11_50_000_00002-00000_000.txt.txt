GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK
FEB. 11, 1949

Me? A Salesman7

Just the other day we happened to run into Johnny
Moon, ’46, who now toils ns admissions counselor for Grin-
nell in the state of Iowa. We pumped him a little about his
work, the story of which boils down to selling Grinnell to
prospective high school grads, and suddenly flipped out the
remark that there was’a Sales force here on campus which
could outsell all 14 admissions counsellors with ease.

The idea did not originate with us. In fact, its basicl
principle is one of the oldest and best known iii advel '
ing. Ask any econ major, and he’ll tell you that unsoli
ed, word of mouth advertising from a contented consumer
is tlle greatest selling force for any product,

The gimmick is simple: no matter how effective an
A. C.’s pitch is, the idea that he gets paid for the job of sells
ing Grinnell is always present; but the satisfied student,
talking plain and simple, packs a more convincing sales
punch.

You don’t need any pep talk from a sales manager,
either. All the selling points of the product you have ex-
perienced at first hand. For example, you know that advan-
tage of a man to man talk with the prof 01' your advisor7
and you don‘t sweat out an appointment for ii month to get
it. We know that yoll agree that hearing 2i lecture right
from “the man" beats getting one from a recording or a
P. A. System: And we know that you are (or will be) con»
vinced that a liberal arts education is a far better deal than
99 courses on the Methodology of Educational Research.

So we told John that, since you represent the college in-
evitably every time you leave Grinnell,_withollt half trying
you could outsell his entire department, Even without a
spiel! ,

OuinumbereleOO foil!

To the ONE student who specified on his ballot that
the DP funds Should NOT be used for Jewish or Catholic
students:

We don’t know wllo you are, or what you think you
are, but drop around, and we‘ll tell you what WE think you
are. Understand, we’re not mail; we‘re happy to know that
at Grinnell you are outnumbered, 1000 to 1.

far from applicable since ihcrci

detract from the fine beginning
we have made.

The “Exchange System” prc:

many to become intimately ac
quainted with members of an
other race through hall and class
participation as well as all-
around good fellowship on the
campus. Courses in Race Rela»

NAACP on campus help.

We hnvc begun. We will cons
tinue. We must succeed.

Lel’rers +0 The
Editor

Dear sols Editors,

May I bring to your attention
the fact that the question which
was asked in the last paragraph
,of your February 4th edition of
the 5&1; concerning the student
body’s not being given a trial
basis “chance” icr another “rec"
room was amply answered in
your paper on the front page;
Quote: ”We must move slowly or
we have to disappoint too many
pcoplc when it is necessary to
take something away. Unquote.
That quoicpnouoic was from
Dean Gardner.

In the same paragraph I will
quote from the 5&3: “The rea-
son, she said. that Loose hall had
not been opened for fulltime use
is because it is better to be sure
the privilege will not be abused
before granting it.”

It would not take the powers
of a student with a logic course
under his belt to find the fallacy
in that reasoning. It seems to
be a presupposition thatthe priVs
ilege will be abused, maybe to-
morrow, maybe in 1963, BUT
THE PRIVILEGE WILL BE
ABUSED! . . . THEREFORE
WHY GRANT IT?

made much larger.”

“I came here," Wyvetter says,
“because I like the exchange
plan, because I am able to cons
tlnue my sociology major here,
and because rd heard so much
about Grinnell from Dean Davis,
who‘s a graduate of Grinnell.”
(Mr. Collis Davis, class of '23, is
clean of students at Hampton
institute. ’

Both Wyvetter, an 18 year old
sophomore sociology major from
East St. Louis, 111,, and Andy‘
plan to attend graduate school
when they linish their under~
graduate work.

Andy hasn’t yei decided upon
a school, but his graduate work
will be in some sociological field.
This, combined with his busi—
ness and accounting training, he
feels will enable him to enter

rthe administrativelarea of 50‘

cial work.

Wyvetter wcs ambitious
enough to juggle ten courses
last semester at Hampton, with
a better than B average. She
plans to study law at the Unis
versity of Illinois graduate
school.

“I’d like to work with the Nat-
ional Association for the Advan-
cement of Colored People," she
says, “and help with the legal
side of their program."

The March of Dimes drive is
over, and the money has been
turned over to the county. Al»
though the $300 goal was not
reached, the college contributed
$207.47 toward the county goal
of $6000. '

Rawson was high in hall con-
tributions on North campus, and
Loose hall came out ahead on
the other side. The greatest
amounts were collected at the
basketball game and from the
sole of apples in the Quad.

Gates hall is not listed, be
cause of the disappearance of
the container placed there.
