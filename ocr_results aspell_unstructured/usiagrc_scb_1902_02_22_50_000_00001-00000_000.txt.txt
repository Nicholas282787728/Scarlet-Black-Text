uIeero Meet wiili town.

A board of control meeting was
held this morning at Dr. Somers’
residence, The members were
all present except c. A. Rawson,
who was represented by R. 1-1.
Macartney. Various matters con-
nected with the athletic teams
were discussed and conslderable
business was transacted. The
schedule for the track team as
stated‘ in SCARLET AND BLACK
was approved, the triangular meet
to be held at Ames on May 9th.
Negotiations are now in progress
for a dual wrth Cue at Cedar
Rapids, but arrangements were
not settled deﬁnitely enough to
receive any orlicial action by the
board. Ifthismeetisscheduled it

than usual, and will give an added
interest to track athletics. No
dual with Iowa will be held, this
year, the reason assigned by Iowa
for refusing to schedule this meet
being that Captain Anderson does
not wish to have more than one

was approved with slight changes.
The State Normal pame June 9
was dropped. since it wasto come

meets with Coe were given up,
one being‘ too early in the season
and one on commencement week.

An alunrni game will probably
be arranged for commencement
to take the place of the Coe and
State Normal games.

The provisional football sched

conditions. Various other mat-
ters of minor interest received
the attention oithe board. but are

Several improvements are con.

GAME DELAYED.
The basketball game between
Western College and Grinnell,
schedrrled tor 2:]; this alternoon,
was postponed till 4‘,'clock. The
Western team missed the connec-
tion at Marshalltown which would
have brought them here at 10:20
this morning and time had to be
given them to make the trip by
wagon road. This is unfortunate
both for SCARLET AND BLACK and
tor the visiting players. It was
intended to have a writeup of the
game in this afternoon's paper,
but its postponement makes that
impossible. The long trip over
bad roads from Marshalltown
here will be a serious inconven-
iencc to the western men, as such
an experlence is detrimental to
best efforts oti the part of the
players. It Is none the less
peralive, however, that Gtinnell,
both in team work and support,
should put forth her best efforts
to win the game

CHRESTO-ELLIS PLAY.

The production of Pudd’nhead
Wilson by tlle Chrestonlathian
and Ellis societies is being await»
ed with considerableinterest. The
cast has been doing nrost iaitlrtul
work in practice and considerable
abillty is being developed in the
presentation of the various char-
acters. The play, in the concep-
tion and execution or the plot. is
extremely striking. anti affords
opportunities for very successful
amateur work. We append the
author's note:

“To all intents and purposes
Roxy was as white as anybody.
but the one sixteenth of her which
was black outvoted the other ﬁf-
teen parts and made her a negro.
She was a slave and salable as
such. Her child was thirty-one
parts white and he, too, was a
slave and by ﬁction of law and

custom a negro.”

PIANOFORTE RECITAL.

A number of people availed
themselves of the opportunity of
hearing the piano recital by the
pupils of Dudley L. Smith, Thur-s
day afternoon. This is the ﬁrst
recital of ‘lillS nature which has
been given here this year and is a
ltind that should be encouraged
by the college Although there
was a fair sized audience, the col-
leg: was not represented in it as
much as it should have been.
The numbers showed that they
were the result or consistentpains
inking work on the part of both
instructor and pupils. and present-
ed a very encouraging outlook

for this depaitment. Some of the
pertormcrs \lere heard for the
’ﬁrst time in recital and others
showed markedimprovementover
tormcr appearances. Mr, Smith
cerlninly has every reason to feel
satisﬁed with his ﬁrst year's work
in the School of Music.

The public recital will
probably be given by those at the
voice department. The program
for the recttal Thursday was as
follows:

Notwithstanding rumors to the
contrary, the [ionic concert by
the Glee Club and Orchestra will
be given Friday evening, March
21. An effort was madeto change
the date to Thursday, March 20,
on account of the Intercollegiate
gymnasium meet, at Madison on
March 22 in which Mrr Walleser,
of the Glee Club, and Mr. Har-
vey of the Orchestra will take‘
part, but it seems inadvisable to
hold the concert in midweek, so
it will occur on the date previous-
ly stated, Also contrary to some
rumors that have been circulated,
the entertainment
in the Colonial Theatre. The
plan of drawing numbers for
choice of seats Will be followed,
as for the lecture course numbers,
with the exception that the time
for drawing numbers wiil be lime
ited to one afternoon. The dcﬁs
iiite time for this will be announce
ed later. The home concert is
one of the big events of the col-
legeyear. and there is good rear
son for believing that the concert
this year will be up to the usual
standard.
