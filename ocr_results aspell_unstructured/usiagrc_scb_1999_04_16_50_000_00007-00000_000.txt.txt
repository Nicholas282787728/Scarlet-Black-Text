pare ourselves for Midwest Conference
play, This week we’ll be a little short
handed because of some injuries but
I’m hoping we can play through it,“
explained Pioneer coach Tom

Sunnichscn.

The team will be without pitcher
lan Maxwell and third basswoman
Etin Doyle. Maxwdl has a pulled a
hamstring and Erin Doyle has a bad

1n the Gtinncll invitational last
weekend, the Pioneers prevailed in one
of three games. ironically their lone

victory came over tourney winner
Grand View, 66.

The visitors ltd 1-0 and Stl be-
fore the Pioneers tied the game in the
ﬁfth inning. Maxwell knocked herﬁrsr
collegiate home run with two runners
aboard to knot the score. in the scv.
enth inning it looked like the contest
would go into extra innings as the ﬁrst
two Pionects madc outs. Laurel
steinmetzsrarted a rally with asrngle.
Katie Ness moved her forward with
another single and Chain Wu drove
in the winning run.

"That was a gratifying win," :x»
claimed Sonnichscn. "our defense was
solid and we got some great clutch hits
in the ﬁnal innings."

The Pioneers fell, 16-7, to
Westminster. Trailing 9-7,1heiniuries
to Maxwell and Doyle hurt crinnells

chances for a comeback.

The hosts had achance to win melt
own tourney with a victory against
Concordia ofst. Paul in the ﬁnal
game. With the score 2.1 in the bot-
tom of the seventh, lei Lennihan
doubled for the second time in the
game, Lennihan and Sara Conner
ended up on second and third wim
one out. The next two Pioneers were
unable to put the ball in the outﬁeld
and score a run.

"it was very frustrating to lose
against Concordia. We certainly had
our chances in the end. We left 12
runners on base,“ said the coach.

With a record of4»11 the Pioneers
have yet to play a league game. "Dee
spite our losing record 1 think we are
making progress. Now we lust need
to learn how to ﬁnish a game. Hope»
fully our tough non»confcrcnce sched

concluded Sonnichsen.

The Pioneers faced Monmouth at
home on Thursday (1:00) and then

crinnell concludes itsweekinahome
contest against Macalester on Sunday
(12:00).

Rainy weather has contributed to
the postponement ofseveral games. of
the three contests scheduled last week,
only those against Cornell and Knox
were played. The Pioneers have yet to
set a date for the postponed home
games against Knox.

Gtinnell went 1—3 on the week,

changing the record to 5.9. Their 8—4
win came ovet Cornell on Tuesday
behind a brilliant performance by Jak:
Chavez, He delivered 10 strikeouts
from the mound to pick up the win,
and supported his own cause by go»
ing as at the plate. Brad Ruhoff also
had a good day, going 2.3 with an RBI,
a run scored, and two walks.

in the second game against Cornell
the Pioneers lost, 85. The lead
changed several times and Grinnell
took the lead in the top ofthe seventh
before Cornell prevailed in its ﬁnal at

"Joel Cladouhos pitched a good
game,” said Coach Tirn Hollibaugh.

“They just outlasted us."

Aaron Rushing had a double and
a run scored.

Saturday the Pioneers dropped two
one.run games, 1.1 and 6-5, at Knox.
"Disappointing is the best deﬁnition
ofrhis weekend. ljust don‘t think we
came ready to play.“

Chavez dominated the ﬁrst Con»
test. He was responsible for 15 of the
18 Knox outs and did not give up an
earned run. Despite his outstanding
performance of 1 s srrikeours, helosl,
tor the ﬁrst time this year.

The second game was also a heart.
breaker for the Pioneers, An outsmnd»
ing pitching performance by

Cladouhos and Nick Palmer in this
manning afrair fell short.

'{We just left too many men on
base this weekend," said Hollibaugh.
"it’s not that we’re hitting the ball
poorly, we're just not getting them all
at the right times. We need to start
stringing some ofrhem together."

l-lollibaugh still feels that the team
is getting better every game. "We have
a lot ofcompetitors who all want to
win really badly. it just seems like we're
trying too hard. it is hurting us, burl
think it is hurting us in a good way.
We'll be a better team in the long run,"
he said. *

Looking at his achievements, one
could understand why pitcher lake
Chavez '01 might not be humble. A
.319 career batting average, a 3.53
ERA and previous spots on several 5:»
lecr national teams are good reasons
for Chavez to be more than willing to
boast about his skills.

The trouble is, he's not. Chavez is
the model ofhumility, Jumping at any
chance he gets to talk up his team, his
coaches or his parents, but never him-
sclf.

His humility, though, hasn’t
stopped him from becoming a
standout on the diamond, and it Cert
rainly doesn’t play a part in his predic-
tions for Pioneer baseball this year.

“Our team is much improved from
lastyear. There's a lot more experience.
We should compete a lot more than
Grinnell baseball has in the past,"
Chavez said. “1 thinkthat we cancom-
pere for a conference championship
this year."

Chavez knows a thing or two about
competing in baseball. besides play-
ing on his high school team in Austin,
Texas, Chavez has played for several
select baseball teams, including the
Baseball Academy ofTexas team in
1996.

Chavez’s success in baseball before
coming to Crinnell comes as no sur.
prise. He has played the sport for 15
years, ﬁrst in Albuquerque, where he
lived until he was 16, and larerar Lake
Travis High school in Texas.

Despite his success, Chavez said
getting involved in baseball was not
necessarily his choice

My dad played baseball, and he
signed me up for little league When
you're a kid, you don't really have any
say in it. I’ll: loved it since then," he
said.

Getting him involved in baseball
was not the only thing Chavcz’s par-
ents have done for him, he said. His
respect for them is obvious.

“My pareno have been a really big

inﬂuence in my life. 1 speak to them a

lot. 1 respect their opinionil think '

ofrhem as friends," he said.

While the choice to get started in
baseball may not have been his, the
choice to playbaseball at Grinnellwas
entirely Chavez’s. He ﬁrst heard ofthe
college though a high school friend
and ﬁnally decided on it after talking
with coaches and seeing the school.

He said he is glad he did. Pot
Chavez, the blend of athletics with
academics at Grinncll make it an ideal
community to be a part of.

“The coaches understand that am»
demics come ﬁrst, so they’re pretty
forgiving about letting you miss prac»
rices or whatever. its different from
other colleges where you have to put
sports ahead to play sports," he said.

The coaches, said Chavez, are one _ .

ofthe strongest points oicrinnell ath—
letics.
“1 really like coach l-1ollibaugh.

Hesagood guy. He'sa good sensor of g
the direction ofthe team. Hes really '

positive. He sets out that goal for us
to win a conference championship.”

Chavez also said he enjoys me cam. '
pus population as much as anything -

about Gtinnell.

“I like talking to -

people. 1 get into more intellectual ' .

convctsations dian I did back home.

it’s nice hearing people's political views ‘ "

instead ofjust kid’s stufE”

Ecsidcs baseball, Chavez is kept -

busy pursuing his major, economics,

and his goal, attending law school af- .

ter receiving his degree.
Fortunately, Chavez said he enjoys

the pursuit oian economic major, det ,

spite what others may think ofit.
“As boring as Olhcl’ pcoplc ﬁnd
[economics], I ﬁnd it kind oflntctcst-
ing. I like the idca ofptcdicting what’s
going to happcn in tcal life, even
though it might not be ituc.”

Predictions, then, are Chavez’s spe- . .

cialty. Perhaps, then, his prediction of

a conference championship in the ,

Pioneers future will come true.
Just don’t expect to see him brag-
ging about it.
