Are Stars,

Those who saw the Ames game last
Saturday are unanimous in expressing
their heliet that at last Grinnell may
boast oi a real icothall team. Although
Ames won hy‘a score at 31 to 7. yet the
store does not begin to indicate the
respective merits or the two teams,
Grinnell gained almost as much ground

pohents. The line, which caused us so
much misgiving betore the game, held
like a stone wall. The backfield lived
up to expectations, and time and again
walked through the highly-touted Aines
line in a manner that 'cztused the Ames
routers to torget that this was merely
a “practice game,” as they would have
had us believe hetore the game.

Even those who were uniortimate in
not seeing the game, can imagine the
ﬁghting spirit which was necessary
to enable a light team to make such a

_.sh~wing against opponents who uu‘.»

‘ weighed them at least ten pounds to
the man. Twice Ames had the hall
within ﬁve )ards oi the thinned goal
on ﬁrst down, and each time the Aggies
round themselves unable to htlleil'nle
our deiense ior even a yard in three
downs. ~

The real ability and spirit ol the
team was evidenced in the last quarter
when Gl'illllell, under [lie dllle general~
ship or “Bill" Sllelnl'al’l, opened upon
the Aggies with a bewildering attack
which carrlrcd the ball over halt the
length of the ﬁeld and culminated in
the only touchdown oi the game tor
