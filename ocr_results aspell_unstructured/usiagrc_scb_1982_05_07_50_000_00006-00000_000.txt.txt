Tomorrow at the “Alice in Wonderland"

relieve tensions produced by the pressures

some students, the location of the party

terms oi academics; others feel the timing
couldn‘t be better.

Spring Waltz.

by Courtney Odishaw

Tonight at u p m, in Darby Gymnasium
’irinncli ‘tudents may waltz to melodic
music provided by a to piece ensemble oi
the Cedar Rapids Symphony, The tradi-
tional music at the Waltz provides a rare
opportunity ior students to graceiuily spin
lind reel across the dance iloor. Many
students have spent Wednesday and‘
Thursday nights mastering the intricacies
of the waltz steps through the very helpiul
and much appreciated dance classes sponr
sored by the folk dancers. Don't feel iris
hib'ited if you did not attend the dance
workshops, ior you can always plead intoxV
ication.

The Waltz remains as one of the few uns
contested Grinnell social events and with
the theme of ”Celebration of Spring," SGA
does not expect demonstrations in irontoi
Quad and Cuwles, The differences between
the Spring and winter Waltz will be few, ex-
cept for the [act that SGA has decided to
shiit the emphasis and appropriation oi
money from decorations to music. This
means that enthusiastic waltzers will not
have to avoid Waltzing into a rather large
Christmas tree in the center or Darby

No dress code is enforced. but Grinnell

fame with two R513 hits on the Chess
Records label, Produced by notable
bluesman Willie Dixon, Taylor's rendi-
tions of “What Kind of Man is This" and ”I
Got What It Takes" catapulted her to
fame, Dixon contributed to the success of
Taylor's career two years later, when, in
1965, Taylor covered his signature song,
“Wang Dang Doodle." The song was her
greatest hit, selling a million copies and
beginning her reputation as Chicago's
firiest blues singer.

Forming her own band in 1972, Taylor
has since worked hard to maintain th'

Beautiful and unusual animation, sur-
realism and an abundance of philosophical
ideas highlight this widely acclaimed
French film. It takes place on a distant
planet where, in addition to some of the
strangest and most captivating beasts you
can imagine, two diiierent races oi
human-like creatures have evolved. The
giant, blue Draags have tremendous menr
tal abilities and keep as housepets the tiny,
primitive Orms, who face extinction at the
hands of their Overlords, The Orms are
even forced to combat each other to enter
lain their masters. The unstable situation
must be resolved, though, and the film
traces the adventure as a new statusquo
emerges. There are probably about as
many possible allegorical interpretations
oi the story as there are people who have
seen it, especially since the oppressed
Orms look quite a lot like humans. But the
movie is primarily a iantastic and entran-
cing trip onto the plane of the imagination.

Haines Hall President Pete
emphasizes the fact that “Alice” will “riot
be a heavy drug party," and he waan to
stress that hallucinogens will not be served
in any form. But beer will flow with great
abundance as there are lo kegs ordered
and two more on reserve. Also, l-lautzinger
encourages everyone to dress as his
favorite character from “Alice" and says
he hopes that people will really “get into
the spirit oi the thing."

Little toys such as paddle-boards,
kaleidescopes. bubbles and whiffle balls
will be provided to amuse and enliven the
participants. Approximately two hundred
people attended last year and with the new
location and forecasted sunny weather.
Haines hopes to double that figure this
year.

subtlty. Yet her recent album, considered
her best to date, has been praised ior
revealing her diversity. Entitled “From
the Heart oi A Woman," this Alligator
release contains swinging rhythm and
blues as well as her usual driving
numbers. mtics hail her reading oi the
Etta James classic "I Would Rather Go
Blind" ior its subtlty oi emotion and style
ing; this song will probably highlight
Saturday's concert.

Taylor has consistently employed iine
back-up musicians who are fully capable
oi brilliant deliveries on any song Taylor
chooses to include in her concert reperr
toire. The energy she and her band bring to
their performances has consistently stunns
ed listeners, who have marvelled that
Taylor‘s howl never loses its power.

A group of right wing extremists oppos-
ed to the treaty led by the chairman of the
joint chiefs, General Burt Lancaster, Con-
spire to overthrow the government by
military junta in just seven days (hence
the title of the film) Marine Colonel Kirk
Douglas, with a patriotic Cleft in his chin,
discovers the plot and tries along with
Commander-in-Chief Fredrick March, to
save the Republic An alcoholic senator
(Edmund O'Brienl and a Washington
playgirl tAva Gardner) are also thrown in
for some extra excitement,

Granted the premise sounds or bit abr
surd, but the movie pretty much carries it
off, One of the interesting motifs
Frankenheimer carries throughout the
film is the use of televisions to both convey
action as it happens and to give the iilm a
uniiying concept. It you can accept this
patently fictionalized and now somewhat
dated view oi Washington and the world,
the movie could offer some excitement. A
tight script and good direction give the
movie its necessary tension. Towards the
final reels of the film some of the dialogue
sounds like a prep school essay on “What
Democracy Means to Me." But to a degree
that's alright too, since this is the kind of
last-paced melodrama that can get away
with it, 7 Catherine Ingrassia
