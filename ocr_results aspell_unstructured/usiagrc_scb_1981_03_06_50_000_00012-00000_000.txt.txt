Henry the Fifth

Directed by Laurence Olivier
Starring Laurence olivier
1945
Fri 9:30 p m,, sL, Sun, and p m . SL
Sir Laurence incorporates elements
of film and theatre with innovative
style in this award-winning interpreta
tion of Shakespeare's political drama.
Critic James Agee has said, "The
seductive power oi pacing alone and its
shifts and contrasts . . has seldom
been equaled in a movie " Olivier uses
several interesting technical devices as
well and the titles and credits are
superimposed on an aerial panorama
which rockets the modern Viewer into a
seat beside the Globe Theatre regulars.
Although Henry t is not as well known
to movie-goers as Olivier's Hamlet and
Zeiiereili's Romeo alid Juliet. it is
nevertheless considered to be the iinest
cinematic adaptation ot a
Shakespearian play by most big-wigs.
