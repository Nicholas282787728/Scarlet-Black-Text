Warns Against Job Otters

At least one tirm oiiering sum~
mer job guides for college students
is allegedly delrauding its custom-
ers by receiving money without
tilting orders tor the job guide
books.

William Deminoff, Directorofcol-
lege Relations, reports that a num-
ber of students responding to p054
ters advertising the AmericanColl-
egiate Employment Institute last
year say they mailed $4.00 to the
Los Angeles firm and never re.
ceived the Collegiate Summer Emr
ployment guide offered by the pass
ters.

' He adds that other students say
they received a book, but it was
not delivered until late April, long
after it would have been of value
to the recipients. These students
also claim that the books were not
useful in obtaining the kinds of jobs
advertised on the Iirm's posters.

Deminoll says that unknown per-
sons have agam placed a numher oi
the firm’s posters on College bulle—
tin boards. He warns students not
to respond to the utter.

A member of the CollegeRelations
stafthas removed as manycopies of
the advertising poster as she could
find, he adds,

Students who rhave already res-
ponded are asked to contact Demi-
nol'f’s office.

In a letter to the United States
Postal inspector in Des Moines,
Deminoff says that his investiga-
tions show the firm is unknown to
the Los Angeles Chamberm‘cummr
erce. and that there is apparently
no listed telephone number for the
American Collegiate Employment
institute,

other Offers

Several other firms offering either
summer employment guides or job
referral services have contacted the
Scarlet and Black about placing ad-
vertlsing.

Their literature has been turned
over to the Career Services Office
[or investigation.

Deminuff warns students to be ex-
tremely cautious aboutsending mon-
ey to firms ollering such guides or
services, and asks that they con-
tact the Career Services Office to
verity the firm’s reputability before
sending any money.

The Scarlet and Black would also
appreciate knowing of such oiiers
so that we may continue our in—

Enrollment
Figures Told

by Thomas Palmer

Although the College is justifiably
proud of its low faculty-Student
ratio, this figure is not a reliable
indicator of class size.

There are 125pr0fessors,instruc-
tors'and lecturers on campus this
semester, including four Joint appr
olntments and seventeen partrtime
faculty. This total is the quantitar
tive equivalent of 113 full-time lac»
ulty members. Thus with a student
enrollment of 1267, Grinnell's fac-
ulty~student ratio works out to 11.2
to 1

There are now 309 classes meeting
(not including reading labs), and
most contain more than 11 students.
Median class size is 18; average size
is slightly higher. Following is a
