Pioneers Drop First Two

Grinnell faced the Statesmen of William Perth for the first time in more
than forty years last Friday night whenthe Pioneers trztvelled to Osknloosa
to participate in the William Penn TiprOtf Tournament, The first round
action saw the Pioneers go down to Penn74759, the first loss ever suffered
at the hands DitheStatesmen,wh0had been 0-4 against Grinnell in previous
action

Things went no better for the Pioneers in the consolation round, Grace-
land racked up a 52-25 lead at halftime and went on to will the contest by
a 24 point margin, 100-76.

The inability ol the Pioneer offense to capitalize on their scoring opporr
tunitles plagued the team throughout the weekend contests. The Pioneers
converted only 40 percent of their attempts from the iield and 56 percent
from the freerthrow line. Unable to control the boards, due to the lack
of height, the Pioneers were out-rebounded 108-68,

“We expected to be onthe shortend oi the rebounding statistics, but hoped
to even up things with shooting percentages of around 45 from the field
and '75 from the charity line,” commented Pioneer coach Ray Boyd. “Ac~
tually, we had only one good Shooting half. That was the Second half of
the Graceland game, in which we hit 50 percent of our field-goal attempts
and went ninerforenine in the free-throw department." Grinnell shot for
51 points in that half while Graceland mustered 48 points in the same span.

There were promising signs, however, The delense was good, and the
Pioneers were moving the ball Very well on offense. Guard Dennis Moss
collected 50 of the 135 points that Grinnell piled up in their tWOrgame set,
25 each night, Forward Bill Bailey added another 10 against Penn and 11
against Graceland.

Grinnell won't have to wait another forty years to avenge the recent 1055

to Penn.

.lV: Close loss

The Junior Varsity basketball team
opened their season last Tuesday
with a 71-63 loss to Central Coir
lege. It was not a well played game
and the fans that were on hand knew
early that the winner would be the
team that decided to make more
points than errors. Grinnell did not
seem to know their plays and er-
rant passes were a familiar sight.
Luckily Central followed the same
game plan so the Pioneers could
stay close.

has good scoring potential and look»

though their height is not one oi
their plusses. The JV may not
be organized or very good yet, but
they have high board scores,
