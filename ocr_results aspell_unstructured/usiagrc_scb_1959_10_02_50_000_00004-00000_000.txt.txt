SCARLET AND BLACK

Must We Buy Red Recognition?

by Jerry Vool'liis l

The Khrushchev visit to the‘
United States has ended with‘
pleasant comments being voiced‘
by him about the American
people and their peace loving
nature over Radio Moscow, an
agreement ior increased talks onl
the Berlin question and other
matters, and renewed hope. ,

immediately when the Soviet
leader visited the United
States, a tlurry oi expectations
greeted him, The Laos situatio
and the Berlin er‘ is had inl
creased popular anxiety to a,
point where the exchange oi
visits between the leaders at,
the two most powerful nations‘
was a welcome breath or ireshf
air in a world rocking with the
stench of hatred and war.

Ccrtain groups and indivi—
duals iavoriug increased un-
derstanding between the Un-
ited states and all people, ins
cluding the Soviets, were
hopctul tor an increased num-
her of cultural exchanges be-
tween West and East. People
apprehensive about the threat
of Germany and central Eur—
ope were looking torward to
possible agreement between
Eisenhower and Khrushchev

, on a disengagement from and
disarmament of that area, still
others hoped that groundwork
could be laid ior universal dis-
armament and free trade.

The trip produced an easing
oi tension in Berlin and in Laos.
it also gave the Russian people
a considerable amount oi vir-
tually pro—American propaganda.
This psychological security and‘
relaxation has been helpful, and
tor this, it not for
reason, the trip has been pros
'ductire, But has it produced

 

anything tar—reaching and com-l_

plete in the direction of world
peace?

The disarmament proposals of
Khrushchev and the negotiations
on that topic must he consider—l
ed in an atmosphere at trust
and compromise. it seems in»
evitable that we will have to

_show signs oi willingness to
agree while the same applies to
Russia. 1

. It appears that we haven't
done our part in showing the
world that we are trying to
melt the Iron Curtain. Khrush-
chev, on the other hand, made
a number of very elaborate
proposals on the subject of to-
tal disarmament and [rear
trade between the United
States and the Soviet Union

We had an opportunity to give
the world a sign of our desire to
agree on some solution to the
present deadlock, and that was.
in. the UN. when Red Chinese
admission was considered. it was
soundly beaten by an over-

lion to this, we have shown no,

desire at all to recognire her.

Our reasons tor non-recogni-

tion are that the Red Chinese‘

are international outlaws and
that they have bccn at war with
the UN in Koiea. We also ob»
icct to any kind of association
ivith them on the grounds that
their government was establish»
means or iorce. Finally
the problem oi the overseas
Chinese is posed. It is said by
our department of state and

3 others that the overseas Chinesel

now living in southeast Asia
and the United States would
transfer allegiance tr n nation
alist China to Red China it the
Communist govcinmenl were

recognized by us.

These arguments don’t seem
to stand up when measured
against those fuvclring recog—
nition and membership in the
United Nations General As-
sembly. First oi all, an inter
national disarmament agree—
ment cannot take place with—
out the consent oi every na-
tion on Earth

In this case, it is doubly ne-
:essary to include the most pop
ulous country in
Communist China. As long as
we refuse to seat Red China and
make her a paity to internation
al discussions on disarmament
which will most likely he held-
in the UN, true disarmament is

limpossihle in view oi the fa ct Near East ﬁlm

also needed if (rank dlscusstons
and negotiations are going to
take. place between ourselves, the
other large nations including the
detacto government at China.

China, unlike Russia, is
branded as an outlaw by the
West, and most oi the nuns
Communist world is in a state
of virtual war with her. This
state of cold war doesn’t get
