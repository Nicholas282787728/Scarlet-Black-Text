The second is a more unified, comprehensive plan,
which has recently gained prominence in Washing-

such a system is that the government sets a cap on

say, plant trees.

The third system is that of a straight forward
carbon tax. Fol each ton of carbon dioxide put into
the atmosphere, the firm

lbclici’c the option ofa carbon tax offers the best
solution to the problem. Proponents of a cap and
tiatle plan point out that it would allow CO,’s value
to be determined by the maikct and would enable the
government to know for ceitain how much carbon
would be emitted. However, by looking at previous
market behavior, one can easily calculate the price
elasticity ofvarious catborrcmitting products such as
gasoline and electricity, allowing a calculation of the
proper tax size necessary to cause a given amount of
reduction. Also, unlike a carbon nut, where costs could
be confidently factored into budgets, the volatility of
the carbon marker under a cap and trade system may
lead to reluctance to invest in renewable energy.

and cotiuption. Rathcl than using a more efﬁcient,
revenue-creating auction, a cap and trade system
might allocate credits based on historical CO,leST
sions in order to avoid lobbyist backlash, meaning
that high polluting industries would be liw/lnlcll for
their past behaviorr Also, RECs and green tags seem
like a hotbed for corruption. Do we really know how
much (if at all) certain acts like planting trees help
prevent global warming How many would have
produced renewable energy anyway and are just milks
ing the federal governments handouts? A carbon tax
would also vastly simplify the ncxt round of the Kyoto
ralks,where China and India will be major stumbling
blocks. lvlajor negotiating will have to take place
concerning per eaprtri emissions stantllirtls vs. histori-
ciil standaids if we tiy a cap and trade system again.
Compare this to a caibon tax which would affect the
whole world equally.

A carbon tax is a simple, elegant and comprelicnr
sivc solution which could be enacted fairly quickly, is
c i1)l nndcrstandable, and affects all leSSlOl’lS, not
just electricity production. Although a cap and trade
system is moie politically expedientbecaiise it is a hid-
den tat on consumers and because lobbyists can have
congressmen build in loopholes for their industries,
a carbon tat would be better for the people anyway:
.1 tax bcncf‘its all Americans, as opposed to a cap and
trade system, which benefits only big business.

The appearance of freedom in our lives

We let centuly youth, we are so
anxious to be free. We sing about it,
rap about it, we write poems and shout
from rooftops about it. Freedom is our
social, political and personal mantra.
Why, then, are we not free, but merely
appear to be
so?

Here in
the United
States and
in many
parts of the ,
world, we
are sold on
dreams: dreams ofwealth, of fame and
of untold joy The desire for the prom
ises of these dreams brings us to invest
in a system which, to a signiﬁcant ex—
tent, limits and constrains our frccdom.
A desire to attain ﬁnancial wealth and
a position ofsome consequence in soeir
ety has us take seriously the importance
ofseleeting a specified major in college,
attaining a specified GPA, interning at
specified companies, entering specis
fred career paths, voting in a speciﬁed
manner, maintaining a speciﬁed set of
acquaintances, and so on. we become
invested in a certain manner of think-
ing and behaving. We become attached
to a certain code ofvalucs and a certain
ethos through which we engage life and
others, At the same time, we are cripr

In chasing dreams, in trying to realise

It is true that we cannot ever be
completely free. Neither should we
want to be so; being tied to and in-
vested in something can be a truly posi-
tive experience. However, we should no
more find ourselves wholly invested in a
given system or lifestyle. Freedom is an
importantvirtue: it keeps us interesting
as persons and democratic as a commu-
nity. Thankfully, it appears possible to
carve out some space for freedom for
ourselves through a critical engagement
with our environment and a thorough
analysis of the lives that we lead and the
choices that we make. We can begin by
questioning the links between our prinr
clples and out actions.We can continue
by being aware of the ways in which we
invest in a certain system and thus give
up our mobility and critical ability

We must not confuse choice with
freedom; the one is already a deliinitas
tion of the other. Indeed, freedom and

fieedom does not lie in our ability to
accept a pre-detctmined choice, but it
hes in our ability to create choices and
to problematise these choices accords
ingly. Thus, while freedom is about
much more than choice, we caniand
must—choose to be free. Choosing to
be free entails choosing to be critical,
choosing to view our own choices with
suspicion as well as with lightshcartcds

tue we must not lose sight of). ChooSs
ing freedom is hard; it is much easier to
choose money or success or even hap»
piness. Yet, in a world where our fret:—
dom is under attack even by those sclfr
declared emancipators who appear on
the screens of out telly and the pages of
our daily paper, the practice of choosing
and cultivating freedom is imperative. I
know of no better cxhortation to leave
you with than this: choose freedom.
