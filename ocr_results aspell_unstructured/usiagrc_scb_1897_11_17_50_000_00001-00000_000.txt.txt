Pres. Gen. A. Gates sport-e more
at length, Ht .spi he of the death

has been more loyal and selfsac»

see it and speak for it as you see it,

The message most frequently
heard from Mr. Chamberlain's
lips was "r ' great best name is

He often said that no riobler
thing could man do then to give
his life to the service of an instie
tiition of learning that shall stand
for two things—scholarship and
character. This he did. So let
us all, each his own way, strive
