Till; DEBUT.

The new management announces its debut. Despite
the tact that this is the thirteenth day or the month and
that we are embarking on a full year of responsibility to
Grinnell college, which includes eveiyone connected with
it, we have not yet felt that shaking or the knees which
is supposed to so with the inauguration uf the new manv
ngement ot a college newspaper The only sensntioo has
been one or a greatly sober-ed mind in contemplation ot
the task ahead ot us: to conduct the Scarlet and Black as
your newspaper in a manner which will live up to the
standards at Grinnell men and women and in accordance
with are best newspaper practice. ‘

Throughout the year which is to come, we shall en»
deavor to publish. first. or all; NEWS. We shall he abs
solutely impartial to all campus organizations and invite
their cooperation. We shall endeavor to work in harmony

to the college authorities in promoting conditions [do
vol-able to the students, to the Taculty and to the general
‘welfare of the college. We shall feel tree at all times to say
what we believe and in doing so we shall attempt to mains
taiii as broad-minded an att" ude as possible. We believe
in the furtherance oi Grinnell as a college for men, in a
more liberal athletic policy, a liberalized social program,

etc, which we shall deal with in future Pdllol‘
