the scarlet and black

United we stand rings a bit cliché

“What do we want.> Economic diversity! How do we get it,>
Lower Tuition!" was one of my ravoritc chants during the “protest"
of February 18. Despite the best efforts of Mark Heniy, however,
the trustees called ottt bluff Not only was there a pathetic number
of people who showed up (at most 200), but the chants were un-
inspiied and fell through after a couple oi minutes. The trustees
who didn't dismiss us, mocked us by pumping their arms as ifthcy
planned to join or protest. One went as far as to take picntres, to
show his business buddies the uninspired hippies who showed up
to his meeting. How cute.

if you haven't realized it already, the tuV
ition inciease has both feet in the door. At a
compound rate of 6.5 percent the class of '08
will be paying well over 540,000 in tuition
and fees by their senior year. I was actually
surprised not to see evcry freshman in front ofthc glove frictory.
Maybe the demographic of Griniicll has changed dramatically
since I arrived here a year ago, but that's a lot of money for anyone,
and it’s well over the increase rate of inﬂation.This is not only the
underclassmeii's problem, however. The plight of himrc Grinnch
lians and the sheer principle of the fact should be enough to get
any student's blood boiling.

The problem is not only within this system in which people
like Osgood and the Trustees have turned a learning institution
into a businessThcsc are the same people who believe that the
prestige of a school is measured by its ticket price and not its hur
man capital. The same people who will have you believe that no
matter what you say or do, the decisions are not up to you; the
same people that mocked us outside of the glovc factory and do
so every day by trapping us in the bureaucracy of the system and
ﬁlling us with false promises of‘iconsidetation.” As long as We let

manipulating prices. Residential life policies will be made unilater-
ally despite the input fioin students. The administration has opt
pressed the Grinnell spirit so much that fcw pcople sce h‘gliting as

The problem with Grinnell students is not that we lack the
power to motivate change; it is that we lack unity. We need com-
mitment to a cause that we know is fair. Evert before we marched
to the glove factory, we were cautioned against going into the
buil ng or doing anything othcr than standing there.
We went to war expecting to lose, not willing to give
up enough, it anything, for the cause. Everyone sells
Grinnell as a close community, but when it comes to
it, 1 sense a high lcvel otapatliy among studciits. our
power has in numbers. Goddnmit,we’rc the ones who
ptit forth the money! We need to stage oldrschool protests. Make
trustees remember how it was when they used to be here. Let them
know that we're not atiaid to put all our cards in the tahlc. They
want a 6.5% increasc,1 say we give them a 70% dccrcasci Since
this new budget is approvcd,I invite at lcast 70% ofcarnpus to not
register for the upcoming scmester.l invite the campus cominnnity
to do sit—ins, work strikes, protest like we mean it. I invite you to
stand up for something that tucking matters. To give lower income
families the chance to afford an education; to unite as a campus for
a common cause; to ﬁnally be taken seriously
If we are to do this, however, we must not do it alone. We need
the support of oui teachers, who instill in our minds curiosity and
the love of learning. We need the support of ottr business comr
miinity, to which we provide both business and labor. We need the
support of alumni who know the cconomic hardships ofcollege

A time for Solidarity

Dear Grinnell College Community,
In recent years, there has been a noticeable deterioration
in the strength otcampus community at Griniiell (among smr
dents as well as faculty, staff, and administration) This trend
, has been accelerated by violations of trust on the part of comr
munity members. Without referring to specific incidents ottt
ofconcem for individuals involved in the ciiminnl process, it is
clear to us that incursions into student affairs by both the police
and campus security is incrcasing at a
frightening rate

compounding this problem is a
general lack of solidarity among the
student population. This breakdown
in community, considered alongside
\mrious policy changes and adminis
trative decisions, negatively affects the quality of student life
on campus. But we can take steps toward addressing the way
such matters are handled We have the power to confront these
problems.

“Selegovemance” is frequently evoked by students and ad-
ministrators alike, but it seems to be poorly understood and
even more poorly implemented, seltrgovcrr
nancc, as we understand it. involves a comr
mitment on the part of students and the
administration to handling problems «ion/tin
the community rather than immediately
delegating rcspousibillty to outside authorir
iicsiauthoritics who are far less likely to
view issues in their propci context and to act
appropriately.

It also involves a commitment to a basic
level of trust in and respect for fellow coin
munity membcts. Only an organized and expressive student
body can reaffirm the powcr ofselfrgovcrnitnce and the integial
role oft/iirlrn/r in decisions regarding college policies,

specit‘ic iucidcnts in the past several weeks ivolviug
breaches of student interests have highlightcd the disconnect
between the student body and the tidniinistiiitOis.This division

out this cngagcinent, decisions about college policy and student
life will continue to be made without transparency or sufficient
student input.

Whether it be in response to exorbitant tuition increases or
to airests on campus, Shol’l'llvcd and unorganized complaints
by the student body have not, do not, and will not effectively
address such dccprsccdcd problems.

In addition to addressing thc lack of effective engagement
with the administration, recent events suggest that students
need to be more compassionate in understanding out respon-
sihility to our fellow students. We must realize the long-term
impact orcriminal charges, recognizing the importance ofdealr
mg with problems at a [otnmkmly rather than jeopardizing an

cicascs, vandalism and a general loss of

It’ s complicated

Like most of the student body, nearly all ottis at the 555’}?
understood Sophomore Paul Waiiiright's Plans cntiy as a
joke, ifin poor taste. Unlike some outspoken members of the
student body, however, waiiirights arrest did not foster in us
a burning desire to lock arms against narcs and The ManThc
issue contains laycis of complexity that no singular response
could errectivcly address.

Iii our eyes, the initial arrest was unfortunate, but under
standable on safety grounds. It was absurd, however, to hold
Wainright on terrorist charges after it was apparent to the ant
thoritics that his posting was a joke. Finally, although we are
somewhat perplexed by the connection between recent events
and broadei ndministmtive policies, we laud the effort to cm-
power students in decision-making for the college.

Waiiiright’s attest resulted from reasonable fears and juSr
tiftahle administration policy. Read by someone who would
choose to err on the side of safety, it is not irresponsible to
wish to inform an authority. A number of Grinnell community
members did see matters in this light,and informed Grinnell
administrators. Some say that at this point, the administra—
tion should have attempted to resolve the matter internally by
inquiring about Wainright’s intentions. Ordinarily, we would
agree After all, selfrgovernance is predicated on open come
miiriication, which has been sorely lacking in recent years.

However, people do have a right to know ifthey are threat—
ened. College policy wisely recognizes this right, and requires
informing those whom threats 2Lte made against. How could
they not do so? In this incident, Wainright threatened the
police, and they were therefore informed. It is unfortunate
that this issue was not resolved with a few conversations with
Wainright. it is also unfortunate that his humor ms dark and
ambiguous enough to be possibly taken seriously, especially
after Columbine once the police were involved, the college
administration had little leeway to shape the outcome or the
case.

What happened once the matter was nimed over to police
was excessive. Wainright’s words did not warrant a week in jail
with bail set at $25, 000 Charges should have been dropped
after the police searched his room and found no stockpiled
arms; probed his hard drive and unearthed no evidence of
conspiracy; and contacted his friends and discovered that he
was a pacifist. Furthermore, even in a post-W11 America, the
First Amendment should still mean something. With that
in mind, he should have been accorded better treatment for
speech that had a high likelihood of being satirical from the
strut.

Prevailing First Amendment jurisprudence supports this
claim. According to the reigning constitutional test for pros-
ecuting someone for speech in Blunderibmg o. onto (1959),
one can only be punished ifspeech is “directed to inciting
or producing imminent lawless anion and is likely to incite
or produce such action.” in other words, prosecutahle speech
hinges on both the speaker’s intent and the likelihood of
achieving a lawless result.Thc Plans rant is far from meeting
either prong of th test.

Additionally, in Mat/i 'L‘. Ulllfl'd State: (1969), the Supreme
Court overturned the conviction of a defendant charged with
willfully making a threat after considering the broader con-
text of the speech W itts reportedly Stntcdb at a public rally,“lf
they evei make me carry a iifle the first man I want to get in
my sights is L. B ..] The supreme court wisely reasoned that
Watts’ speech, when taken in context, was protected under
the rust Amendment and was nothing more than "a kind of
veiv ciutle ott‘ensive method ofsmting a political opposition
to the President.

Wainrights Plan was clearly nothing more than a crude
otrensivc mcdmd or stating opposition to anothei admimsr
nation Given the weakness of the case against Wainright,
charges should be dropped immediately; prolonging this inat-
ter vvill only bring more unnecessary hardship for Wainright
and his family.

Wainright’s arrest has mushroomed into a student move—
ment in response to the administration and its policies. Al-
though we think the arrest is not necessarily an example of
detrimental administrative policy, we agree with the under
lying resentment and anger it has revealed. As policies such
as the recent tuition increase made painfully apparent, an or-
ganized voice is needed if the interest of students is ever to
be meaningfully considered. We only ask that students not
sacriﬁce constructive dialogue in their calls to incite action.
