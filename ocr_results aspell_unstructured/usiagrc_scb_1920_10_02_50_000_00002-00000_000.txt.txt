 

They arrived yesterday, these beautiful STRAP SLIPPERS made of lustrous black satin.
The heels are high and slender Louis, the strap begins at the heel and goes over the instep
holding them on securely. This strap style is the latest and one that will predominate at
dances and parties this Winter. “Black satin makes the feet look smaller.”

ABOUT THE CYCLONE l

“'ith the tlullouilcelncnt of the
plans for the 1922 Cyclone in this:
issue, only three things remain to
be done before next May. One:
part is tlle collection of copy and
pictln'es for the Cyclone. The sec-
ond part is the sale of llle book,
and the t id is 'is delivery,

The 1311‘ and lost are
functions of the cyclone board.
The second one is up to the studs
ents. To sell a thing, there must
be buyers, and the larger the prey
ject, the more buyers there must
be.

This year the Uyclonc proposl»
tion is a larger and more difficult
one than ever before. It was
thought for some time that the
great cost of producing the book
would mean the cutting of the
book to a smaller size, with fewer
pictures, with chcaper paper, and
poorer covers. It was unanimous-
ly decided, however, that it must
be either the best, or nothing at
all.

Only the confidence of the
board in the support of the entire
student body caused the board to
consider lulderttlhing the publica»
tiou of the annual. The price was
necessarily advanced, and the 100
per cent subscription of the stud-
ent body was figured as the only
way to meet the costs of publica-
tion.

Tile Scarlet and Black believes
that the board did right in at-
tempting the publication of the
Cyclone without cutting down the
standard of the book. Especially
this year, the scveutyl‘ifth year,
the college needs the Cyclone to
put down a history of the events
of the day, and the records made
by the college. With such ul‘d.‘
treial it cannot help but he a book
that every student. it ill \vnut. Tile
Cyclone board is not bashful
about admitting that it needs the
subscription of every student, and
is equallv frank in stating that
the book will be the best ever.

The campaign for subscriptions
opens today, and Will continue
during the week, Every student
should sign for a hook at the first
opportunity, and consider it a
privilege.

in the future, there will be nol

athletic standpoint alone, there is
sufficient reason for the making
of the rule. lt is due athletes,

even with volume of sound, but
not with the iiumhcrs of men.

There must he more men in a

many opportunities to be oi ser—

football trips and at the many
other entertainments, it is- a most
agreeable addition. If the hand

the college would give it better
