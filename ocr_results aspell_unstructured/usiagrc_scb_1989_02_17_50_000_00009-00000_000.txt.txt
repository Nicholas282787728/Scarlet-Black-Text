the emphasis in minority

The response was that Grinnell
feels a special obligation to
blacks. Drake added [hilt Grinnell

Mesquakie show reviewed

by Kate Leonard

“Striking" and “beautiful" are
words that come to mind after
viewing works by Mesquakie
artists now on exhibit at the
University of Iowa Museum of
An. The show, Art of the Red
Earth People: the Mesquakie of
Iowa. is a rare comprehensive
overview that spans 200 years
and contains all known visible
artistic forms known to the
Mesquakie. The Mesquakic are a
Native American tribe whose
people presently live on their
settlement near Tama, Iowa.

Native American artists are
rarely recognized as individuals
are Native American artists
recognized as individuals. More
frequently, their identities are lost
when their pieces are labeled
broadly as Mesquakie. Sioux. or
Navajo. This exhibition
however, identifies specific
artist’s work -while
chronologically tracing stylistic
and functional changes within
Mesquakic an in general.

The Mesquakie have a great
sculptural tradition in wooden
bowls and spoons. This show
contains a distinctive group of
fine burl bowls and spoons by
John Young Bear. These bowls
are carved from tree burls.
bulbous swelling: on the sides of
trees (usually cherry. ash or
maple) The artist cuts a burl
from a grown tree and uses a
“crooked lolife.” which is a curled
blade, to hollow and carve out a
smooth inside. These bowls and
spoons have a deep lustrous
surface with a rich swirling gain.

The spoons incorporate stylized
efﬁgies and clan symbols such as
the horse and the turtle. The role
of these bowls and spoons in
ceremony and religion is private

- to the Mesquakie people, but

their artistic austerity, and
technical sophistication is clear
to the viewer.

In addition to wood carvings.
decorative jewelry and clothing is
represented in the exhibition. as
in Stella Lasley Young Bear’s
shoulder bag of intricately
loomed beadwork. Although the
exhibition does not include as
many contemporary artists as it

might, it is rare that a museum
puts together such a show and a
privilege to be able to see and
learn about the art of the
Mesquakie. The show continues
through February 26 and should
notbe missed. if at all possible.

If you are interested in
becoming involved with the
Mesquakie settlement in Tama,

American Interest Group provides
tutoring for Mesquakie children
on their settlement every
Thursday evening. For more

monotone. His lyrics have seen
similar downgrading, now
possessing all the subtlety of a
baseball bat. Other critics have
explained these changes as a
“maturing process." but I think
of them rather as a way to sell
records now that R.E.M. has run
out of any truly original (or even
interesting) ideas.

There are occasional bright
moments on Green. Buck‘s
cream-style guitar solo in
“Stand,“ though perhaps out of
place, nevertheless brings a
smile. The piano on ”World
Leader Pretend" nearly makes up
for that song’s tiresome lyrics.
“You Are the Everything” is a
good enough song that if it only
had a dmm uack, it would rtval
past successes. Mike Mills'
backing vocals are at least as
good as ever. Sadly. though,
these few elements do not
guarantee a good album, and
Green stands as an example of a
band trying too hard to balance
critical acclaim with commercial
success.

This Album’s Grade: C

The senior recttill by Robin
Triplclt, originally scheduled for
Sunday, Feb. 19, has been
postponed until March.
