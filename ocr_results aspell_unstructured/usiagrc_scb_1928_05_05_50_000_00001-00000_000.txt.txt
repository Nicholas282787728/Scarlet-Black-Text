All previous attendance records
were broken in tile annual high school
track meet held .this afternoon on
Ward field lluder the auspices of the
Grlnllell Hollor “G" .club, when thir-
ty ight high schools conlpcted for
the prizes offered. Over five hundred
high scilool atilletes participated ill
the meet.

Tlle scllools which were represent
ed include Toledo, Lone Tree, Harvey,
Adel, Allel-tou, Alta, Baxter, Belle
Piaine, Boone, Brooklyn, Grant. and

Weather is Favorable.

warm weather in all sections of the
state for the past weelr has insured
perfect training conditions for lnost
of the athletes, With perfect weather
prevailing throughout the day, and
only a slight breeze and chill to af-
fect the otherwise perfect day, fast
time was registered in the pi'elimiv
narics wllicll began at ten o'clock this
morning and continued on lllltll noon.

The half mile and quarter mile
events selned to have the edge on the
number of entries. There were one
hundred and frve entered in the fornler
race and one hundred and two in the
latter. In the preliminaries this
morning the number lvas shaved to
seventrﬁve in each event.

in the 440 yard dash, Webb, North
high, who last year won third place
in this race was entered. it was
thought before the races that he would
be unable to compete because of a
severe cold. This caused consterna-
ticn among the followers of North
High because he was counted on to
place. Others who were counted on
to turn in fast time were Longcor and
Hiatt of Oskaloosa high. All of these
men clipped off the quarter in the
neighborhood of the 52 second mark.

Twenty East High Entries.

Mike Augustine, East high coach,
arrived with twenty men. This was
the record entry from any one school.

One of the features of the entire
afternoon was the attempt to shatter
Hoyt's century mark of :03 seconds.
Hoyt made this sensational mark dur-
ing his prep career before coming to
Gi'iimell, where he establisehd other
records of long standing. ' Chase of
Roosevelt, Burns of Webster City, and
Rain of Cedar Falls were shooting for
the record in the century. Chase
placed third in this event last year.

Advance dopesters watched Loogcor
of Oskaloosa closely in the half mile.
He has attracted far more attention in
this event than in the quarter. Byers
of Grant high, who is Longeor’s closest
competitor. would have to rlln better
than 2:08 to win.

If advance predictions were correct
the mile relay should have been one
of the fastest and closest of the day.

Coach Duke Takes Full Squad To
Northﬁeld Conﬁdent Of Taking
Dual Track Meet.

The Pioneer track squad invaded
the Carleton college stronghold at
Nortilficld, today ill the first dual
track meet held in recent years. Tile
Carleton college squad is one of the
nlost powerful in the middle west, and
it is expected that competition will
be close ill practically every event.

Coflcli Dllke took a full squad of
men to Nox'thfield. Tllose who lllade
Le~
gore, McKee. Taylor, Long. Phillips.
Selle, W tt, Hoffman, Cleland. Mark,
and Barnes.

Carleton will be well represented in
the hurdles. The Minnesota school
is also reputed to possess several fast
distance men. and as this is one of
Grinnell's weakest points the Cal-ls
sll'culd score heavily. -

However, with warm weather pres
vaifing the past wcclr. Coach Duke
has surceded in collrlltionins his men.
With Taylor- running the hurdles and
qualifying for the sellliriinnls in the
Drake Relays last Saturday ill the
company of the country's fastest
hardicrs, dope has it that Crinncli
sllouid win in ti s event, Taylor has
been turning in phenomenal time durv
ing practice sprints the past week.

Although Gl‘lnllell possesses one of
the best nlile relay teams in this secs
tioll. Carleton has an aggregation that
took second place at the Illinois
meet.

Carleton college is a member of
the mid—west coi‘lfcrcnce consisting of
semen of its own type. Grinnell has
entered men in the university soction
of every major track meet in this sec-
tion of the country. The outcome will
be close as Coach Hunt has had suc~
ccss with his track teams in the past.

Next week the Pioneers will com-
pct with Drake and Ames on Ward
field in a triangular met. A limited
number of men will go to the h .
soul-i valley meet at Lincoln, May 19.
Those who show up well at this meet
will probably go to the Central In-
tercollcgiatc meet held in the Mar—
ouettc stadium in Milwankcc.

by taking four or five men to the na-
tional lncet in Chicago the middle of
June.

Quadite Finds Startling Things
Amid Collection ”of “Trophies”

Following the popularity of the
song “Among lily Souvenirs," it was
decided to take inventory of just what
people do keep in their treasure

do look up when couvelltions meet.
And after the investigations had pros
cceded for sometime in both the
Quad and the Dorms. the rcsearch be-
come more and more enlightening,
What particularly surprised us was
the apparently paradoxical aspect that
it took on, for in the buildings tel-ls
antcd by our big hermen, many things
were found which might have belong-
etl more appropriately to c0~eds. And
in the quadrangle such vicious and
dangerous mascots as elephants and
chipanzees were found. In fact, in
one room in Central there is both a
turtle and some goldfish. it seems
that these first have been nlore sue»
ccssful in surviving this strenuous
existence than sonic others of their-
species—for instance the deceased
nets of Florence Geier and Alice Rode
ulnar.

 

Whereas 'l‘heodorerbears are more
common ill the road, it is reported
that there are several teddy-bears in
the dorms—principally in the Stables.
And speaking of keepsakes ill Build—
ing Three, there are several inmates
who are evidently of the Order of the
