definite preferences for that type
of work. Sales work ranked sec-

Men Cut Paper Dolls!

And All Because
of an Art Assignment

"Silly? Sissified? Perhaps it
is, but it’s not a had way to earn
two hours' credit." That's the
comeback some heckled Grinnell
men are making to their friends'
jibes about cutting paper dolls.

For the new occupation isn't
due to a return to childish pas-
times. No, indeed. They are in the
art appreciation class and are ab-
sorbed in clipping smartly dressed
figures from the Esquire and vari-
ous other fashion magazines.

Guided by personality charts,
each one is assembling in pictures
a wardrobe which is most suited
to his type of appearance.

Because of an assignment by
Miss Marietta Kettunen, instruct:
or of the art appreciation class,
they are also obtaining accessories
which will harmonize with the
campus, informal dinner, formal,
and sports outfits.

In addition, they are mounting
pictures for their rooms of fur-
nishings which will exemplify their
personalities.

Most of the men are taking it
good-naturedly, although a few of
them consider it silly and unman-
ly to indulge in such pursuits.

A new way to kill time has
been invented by students at
Northern Illinois State Teachers
college. They draw a circle rep-
resenting a clock and hands. At
five minute intervals they ink out
the sections around the dial. At

pletely filled.

Coach Pleased
With Performance
of Football Men

Halfway through the second
week of the eight weeks spring
football drills, Guy Lookabaugh,
head grid coach, said yesterday he
was pleased with the showing of
the squad of so Pioneers who are
reporting rcgularly.

Thc gi-iddeis have devoted this
week to practice on passing and
kicking after spending last week
in blocking, tackling and condi-
tioning exercises. Plays were
handed out late last week and the
Pionccrs Will be ready for inten-
sive scrimmage by Friday.

Last night the men went
through a stiff pass-scrimmage for
nearly an hour as they worked out
the intricate ball-handling ol the
tricky double-wing system em-
ployed by Lookahaugh.

Because of the lack of weight
and experience among the hack-
field candidates. Buck Snow has
been retained at his blocking post
in the backfield instead of being
shifted to guard as the Pioneer
coach had originally planned.

“L. H. Anon,” Cornell univer-
sity‘s mysterious benelactor, has
made his third donation to this
institution. The cashier's check
of $35,000 will be applied to the
endowment fund of the college of
engineering.

Smoking in moderation might
have a beneficial effect, says Dr,
Arthur Biuz, professor of chemis-
try at the University of Berlin.
Coramine, a derivative of tobacco
nicotine, stimulates the heart.
