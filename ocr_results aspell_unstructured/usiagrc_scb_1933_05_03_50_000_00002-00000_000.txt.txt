A SIMPLE MATTER

Discussion of the situation in regard to a
varsity swimming tcaln for next year has as-
sumed college-widc proportions. Action on tllc
matter, it seems, has been duplicated by the stu-
dent council and the Council of House Presidents.
The former will act on semester fee apportion
ment Sunday, and the latter has conducted a
campaign at several house meetings, asking own
their preference in regard to which departments
should be cut to provide for the swimming appro-
priation.

For the small amount of money needed to
maintain next year’s swimming schedule, it seems
that too much of a hullobaloo has been in scd.
The matter can be taken care of very simply by
pro-rating an allottment from music, lecture, and
the surplus which the International Relations con-
ference will return from its two per cent. There
is no need, whatsoever, to drop any one depart»
Incnt entirely from the school, Debate can exist
Very well on its three per cent, inasmuch as that
department did not spend its entire fund this last
year. Because of the deficit which the music (le-
partlncllt owes the college, that department can
be cut to three recitals next your, pay its deficit
and give the remainder of the savings to the swim-
ming team.

The Sum of $200 or $250, deduced from a see
master fce fund of nearly $10,000 should not put
a crimp in the activities of any department.

THAT CURVE ON HIGHWAY 6

At the convention of the Iowa Collcgc Press
association last week end, Prof. Frederick J. La-
zcll of the 'uive lty of Iowa, commented oil a
recent editorial in The Scarlet and Black, which
called attention to the dangcl-ous corner at tllc
intersection of highway . (S and Park Sll'CCl.
Ho declared that he had often noted the corner

in driving along the route, alld lleJll/ily agreed
that some sort of warning sign should he posted

G
THE YEARBOOKnHERE TO STAY

"The ‘ rbook is hero to stay." These were
the “or of a speaker at the state convention of
college ,loul'llalist‘ at Cedar Falls last Saturday.

A g latioll in some schools favo llg the discon-
tillnllllcc of the annual or yearbook was decried by
speakers and delegates at the meeting. “For ~
yours from now, or even twenty years from now,
your collage animal will be among your most
precious possessions.” said one mall.

It i i to. The book of campus scenes, stu~
dellt organizations, and familiar faces i a collc,=
tradition which should not die. Regardlc's of eco-
nomic depressions, the book can continue ill it
smaller form, perhaps, with smaller engravings,
hut it can continue.

College is lifcinot ulcrcly a transition pe-
riod. For that portion of our life 'pellt ill coir
lege, We shall have memories which may help to
tide ovcr fl few loan pcriods. Thc yearbook cn~
helices those memories more than any other sou-
\‘CDIY.

THE COLLEGIATE FOURTH ESTATE
(I’m-k Stylus, Park College, Me.)

For the past several months We have been in a
position to examine the newspapers published by our
contemporaries in about twenty-five colleges. Each
week the Stylus exchanges copies with these publica-
tions, and a certain Copley room is deluged with papers
from as far west as New Mexico. as far south as Missi-
ssippi, as far north as North Dakota and as far east
as Pennsylvania.

If we are to judge from the standards of these
papers, we must confess that our opinion of college
weekly joumalism is not high. We are convinced, in
fact, that more unadulterated drivel appears in the
columns of small college weeklies (our own not by any
means excepted) than in any other field of public print,
with the possible exception of high school papers. Most
of these publications exhibit an appalling lack even of
the rudiments of journalistic standards, but their most
flagrant defect, as we see it, is carelessness. They are
careless in the mechanics of their papers, show little
evidence of intelligent rewriting and frequently print
the most hackneyed and inferior brand of material.
Ignorance of journalism is forgivable. since a number
of these colleges are unable to offer courses in the
field. But it seéms inexcusable that editorials and feet»
tures of so many college publications should not only
be utterly trite but downright simple.

There is at the outset little excuse for the existence
of the small college newspaper anyway. Its "news”
is already common knowledge before the paper appears.
So that, as we see it, the only valid reasons for thc
montinuancc of a college weekly are its opportunities
as a commentary on campus life and its facilities for
finding out student sentiment and, so far as permitted,
expressing it. Its usefulness is often limited by various
circumstances to the former capacity. To fulfill it
ereditahly, the newspaper must be good; whether it is
being dignified or humorous, it must be competently
one or the other if it be worthy of continuance.

This newspaper is far from guiltless in that respect,
and our criticism should be all the more valid, coming
from one of the offenders. We plead for originality in
ideas and style in small college journalism, We should
like to lead a crusade to eliminate from our own and
our contemporaries papers the high school brand of
thought. Let us give evidence of what is regarded as,
theoretically at least, the collage mentality.

Monday

Dwight Campbell, president-elect
of the student council, spoke of the
recent student convention which he
nttciirlerl at the University of Kah-
sas, and described a number of ideas
discussed there.

Among them were the denuncia-
tion of the honor system, the reform
of the present point grade system,
and a recommendation that the
Grinllell system of grades be adopted
by all the schools in the conference.
The students also proposed a com-
mission government by experts to
take the place of the present Amer-
ican republic.

Tuesday

Prof. John D. Stoops declared ”The
higher life in the brain of man is any
solutely dependent for its function
on that of the lower brain. In the
same way, social life can go on only
because there is an underlying basis
of unconscious routine. We call it
custom and tradition.

”We couldn't function in society
unless we had learned unconsciously
to appropriate and make our own
these traditions and customs that
have come down to us from the past.
We Americans have been as depend-
ent on the customs and traditions of
the past as any race, although we
don’t recognize it."

Wednesday

Mrs. Eloise Haggard Ryan, pian-
ist, played three numbers: "Noon
turrie," Chasine; “Chimes of st. Pat-
