The finders have identified
themselves to Dean of Men
Henry Brown. and were to have
talked with him this afternoon.

Rex said thatseveral possible
sites for the Set will be con~
stdered. He mentioned Loose
lounge, the Little Theatre, and
“possibly some place on north
campus."

There was some indication
,that the set will be placed on
isouth campus, because as Dean

Scott, whose Concert is be.
ing sponsored by the Women’s
social budget committee, will
include in his lprog‘l‘em compo.
sitions by Chopin, Scarlatti, and
Liszt, as well as “Chopin in the
Citrus Belt," “The History of
the Lost Chord,” and “Rhythm

Pianist Henry L. Scott, who appears tonight in the women’s

gym, displays something of what he means when he says that
“music can he fun." In his concert, Scott will include both modern
and classical music, acting on the theory that concerts should be

“diversified enough to appeal to

all."
