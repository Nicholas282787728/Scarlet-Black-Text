it- scoring

by iiachalvcrt

It’s always an honor for a
basketball team to hold the top
scorer in its conference It kind of
adds to the team's bearing and
reputation, as well as picking up
fan interest.

Grinnell's varsity cagcrs have
taken that honor one giant step
lurther this year, however Two
Pioneer iorwards, Bill Bailey and
John Haigh, are currently tied,
point ior point, for loop scoring
honors. And the season enters the
iinal week tonight.

Both Bailey, at senior irom
Chicago, and Haigh, a junior irom
Des Moines, have held down the
top scoring spot alone at various
times throughout the year,
Tonight, however, as they take the
court against Cornell in Darby
Gymnasium. each has scored 255
points in 14 conference games.

Pressure? Both refuse to
recognize it. Bailey told the SM!
this week that he. like the rest of
the team. will be going out there to
win this weekend, not to score.
“I'm not thinking about the scoring
title,” he insisted, “as long as we
win those two games Friday and
Saturday.”

lliligll: Letliill hau‘il

Haigh was equally unlmprcsscd
by the scoring situation. “1’“ Just
play the same game i always do
It’s no big deal I guess its
something nice that's come along,
but it’s just no big deal."

“it would be nice to see Bill get
it,” added Haigh. referring to his
teammate. “He being a senior, it
might mean more to him than it
does to me."

Ron Mitchcll, head coach of the
Grinnell cagers, also anticipated
no problems. “Because oi the team
play we've been emphasizing all
season, I don't think the scoring
race will give us any trouble,” he
stated, “It would be a nice thing for
Bill to Wind up his carcer with a
scoring title, but it would also be
nice for John to return next year

with it under his belt."

able to silence the top Chicago
scorer through the second half.
Thus, “Outstanding Pioneer."

Pioneers nab pin crown

by Toni Areiiberg

Those persons who have written
to professional sports leagues to
complain about the haste with
which title races are decided,
should get out their typewriters
again. Address this one to the
Midwest Bowling Conference,

The ”league" began competition
on Feb, 15, and by sunset that day,
the championship trophy was in
Grinnell’s showcase.

Coe and Grinnell are the only
conterenee schools with bowling
teams, so when the Pioneers and
Kohawks met here last week, it
was decided that the winner would
be declared conierence champion.
Led by its top two bowlers, Denny
Minami and John Rensenhouse.
Grinnell literally rolled to victory
by more than 400 pins,

The match, which gave Grinnell
its first conference championship
this school year, was also the
School’s first 1974-75 inter-
collegiate, coeducational Coma
petition. The three—game scores icr
five men and five Women were
combined to determine the final
results.

With only Coe sporting a team,
coach Anna Wack has had to look
outside the conierence for op—
position. Prior to the Col: match.
the Grinnell mcn had lost to a
men's town team and had defeated
a Concerned Black Students learn
and a college faculty learn

Future contests includc a
challenge lo the town high school
team. and possibly i-cmatches with
the men's team and One. Regar-

dless of the outcome of future
matches with the Kohawks
Grinnell will retain the conferenc
championship, The women will
play a ladies’ town team and
Central College.

Wack said she is not concerned
about the lack of conference

bowling teams. She doubts that
additional league competition will
be worth tolerating the
unavoidable travel difficulties. §

Maybe not. but at least it nould
lengthen the championship chase
To a couple of days. perhaps?
