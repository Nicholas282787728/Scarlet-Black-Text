A Year’s-End List of Complaints

John Newmark

At the closing or a year, it is
traditional for a columnist to write
a series of reflections. I see no
reason why I should break this
tradition. This was my first year at
Grinnell, since I graduated from
high school just one year ago. I am
incredibly happy here. where else
could a freshman get a weekly col-
umn published in the school
newspaper? That job would be oie
iered only to seniors at many cola
leges or universities. I have also
gone through eight wonderful
courses with eight wonderiid pro-
tessors.

The atmosphere around the col»
legs is better than i expected.
There is very little peer pressure
ior me to do anything i don't want
to do. The students come irom a
variety of different backgrounds,
but somehow we all get along. lam
getting a good education and hav-
ing iun at the same time. 1 have
very iew gripes about Grinnell.
However, I would like to explain
two that I have, since the press is
supposed to be one oi the best
places tor a person to air his or her
concerns.

My iirst major complaint, and
that of many students here at Grin-
nell, is the way the administration
and board of trustees spend the
money. Grinnell is supposed to
have one oi the highest enr
dowments per student nation-
waide, However, during Peace
Day last weekend, Grinnell
couldn‘t aiiord a quality sound
system for one oi its speakers. A
comedian was iorced to go through
her periormance sans microphone
in Darby Gymnasium. I heard a
visitor who was sitting behind me
say Something to the effect of, “It
is a shame that a college such as
Grinnell doesn't have enough
money ior a quality sound
system." The iact that Grinnell
also just spent thousands oi dollars

on three ugly “you are here” direc-
tories makes me wonder whether
the administration knows what it is
doing, This campus is quite small;
I’m not sure any directory is need
ed, much less three. The money
spent on these directories would
have been better spent on a sound
system that works. While I do hold
this complaint, I also realize that
almost every student at every col-
lege has the same complaint, Miss
pent money is almost inevitable.
And directories really aren't a hor-
rible idea; it’s just that too much
money was spent on them.

My second gripe is about some oi
the students here. Some people
want to change the college mascot,
the Pioneers, since the pioneers
killed thousands of Indians, Others
want the college to sell the shares
oi stock they own in companies
connected in any way to South
Airica. There is one, similarity
among all these protesters: they
are not protesting in hopes oi mak»
ing any changes. They only want
themselves to ieel better. By
changing the mascot name, no in-
dian is going to be helped in any
way. No land will be returned, so
what’s the purpose? The same
goes with divestment. Once we sell
our shares, someone else will buy
them. IBM or any other company
will remain connected to South
Africa. Students will feel better,
but nothing will have been done.
The logical thing to do would be to
keep the shares, perhaps buy
more, team up with other colleges
to iorm a block, and vote. By sell-
ing our shares we are waiving our
right to vote. Imagine how many
shares oi stock in a corporation an
individual college can own. Now
multiply that by the number oi cola
leges in the nation. Perhaps we
could actually do something.
Perhaps we could get the com
panies out oi South Africa ior good.

Courtesy a Lost
Virtue at Grinnell

Luc Hatlestad

It never ceases to amaze me how
so many individuals, most or whom
were raised in middle and upper»
middle-class environments and
were blessed with varying and ex
traordinary degrees oi in-
telligence, can routinely behave as
it they were raised by wolves,

To begin with, there has been a
year-long rash oi vandalism on the
tombstones. The Students'
displeasure with these has been
endlessly chronicled in the form of
letters, articles, and, most recent-
ly, Titular i-lead videos. The ieel-
ing has been that they are useless
because anyone whos been here
for a month knows where
everything is.

But guess what? The school
didn't erect the signs [or us. They
were put there for the kids with the
red»and-white folders who are try-
ing to locate the various buildings
so they can decide it they want to
continue their education here. Van-
dalism of the tombstones, which do
not disimprove the campus land
scape, or oi anything else, is an
anonymous and thereiore gutless
act which beneiits no one except
perhaps your intolerant psyche. ii
the signs make you that dreadiully
unhappy, transier. Besides, jokes
like the word “tuition" with the ar-
row next to it or the “you are here”
dot were clever in September, but

are rather stale in May.

Another aspect of disrespect
here at Grinnell is less apparent
but occurs more frequently. The
level and paucity oi extensions oi
courtesy at this couege is appalling.
It oiten seems that the phrase
“excuse me" and "thank you” are
regarded by some as being as
unspeakable as, “You know, I real~
ly think I admire that Ollie North,”

You can see it happening
everywhere. Take parties: people
crawling all over each other ior
that elusive Hardee's cup of foamy
keg beer. ii you're that hard up ior
a buzz then Lake the walk to
McNally’s or find someone to drive
you to FoodA-Less, where izepacks
of Milwaukee‘s Best or Schaefer
are always $2.99, no waiting.

After having pressed against a
halfvdozen sweaty bodies ior 2o
minutes, you can weave your way
through the crowd in an attempt to
locate some breathable air, You
might spill a iew drops oi your own
beer on a iew innocent party-goers.
or maybe even cause them to
dump part oi their own beer on
themselves with a well-placed hip
check. but what do you Care? Of
course. it the same thing happens
to you, totally different story. Now

But students won’t feel good it
their college doesn't divest, and
tooling good takes priority over ac~
tually making a diiierence.

While 1 disagree with the actions
oi the administration, and some oi
the students here, overall my iirst
year here at Grinnell has been
good, and I will return next year.
While some people think my cole
umns are a waste of space, others
have complimented me on them. i
know i have enjoyed writing them.
The dining-hall iood. while not
great. is better than most colleges.
And somehow i iound a good suite
to live in next year, as well as three
people who have ior some reason
agreed to put up with a iascist
kneejerk liberal as a roommate. i
want to thank everyone who has
criticized my writing this year 7
you add excitement and spice to
my life. it would be quite dull it
everyone was iriendly to me. 1 also
want to thank everyone who has
complimented my work. it would
be quite depressing ii everyone
was hostile towards me. I shall be
back next year. Whether you take
that as a threat, or as a thing to
look iorward to, it is the truth. See
you next year,

Student Contests

Belittlement of
KDIC Incident

To the Editor:

1 ieel very angry about "the
KDIC incident" and the response
to this incident. By now, I will have
probably lost a large portion oi
readers, ior many will be turned
oii by this emotional — meaning,
oi course, typically iemale v redo
tion. However, i will continue
because i do not want to be silent
on this issue,

I attended last Wednesday
nights .loint Board and leit ieeling
irustrated, angry. and belittled. i
had not read any oi the articles or
letters concerning “the KDIC inci-
dent" prior to this time and
thereiore ielt iairly neutral on the
issue. what i saw happen there
was the total trivialization oi an in»
cident that had oiiended a number
of people on campus 7 a majority
being women. 1 saw statements
like, “well, everyone is racist, sex~
ist, and homophobic," and,
“They're (Dave, Bill, and irienrb)
human,” being tossed around the
room in an eiiort to belittle the
issue. 1 know that I ielt, as a
woman, belittlcd and silenced. 1
had the distinct, iamiliar ieeling
that because this issue was deem-
ed offensive to “only women," that
it was not truly a legitimate issue.

After the meeting, i decided to
read the Scarlet and Black articles
and letters that dealt with “the
KDIC incident.” I got this creep
ing, iamiliar ieeling that ii an
issue, a statement, or an action is
not supported by a man/men
(meaning supported by only a
woman/women) then it is deemed
by a great proportion oi people as
being unimportant, Collins states
in the April 15 edition oi the s and B
that he “became frustrated that all
the callers were women" and, “If
something is truly oriensive to
everyone, then there should have
been calls irom everyone. It's not
fair to get loads oi abuse about
something that oiiended only
women .. Hmm, only women? Oh,
I understand e ii a man or a iew

On Second Thought

Bill Lohaus

The underlying crisis we face is
that of values; we don’t know what
we believe, and we don't know
what lines we should draw. So we
don’t draw lines, at least not con
sistent ones. This has been
highlighted recently by the con-
troversy over the KDIC incident
and the appointment of Dave Stein
man as social coordinator of SGA.
The value-pertinent issues are
women's rights and personal
honesty; both of these have been
somehow written oil as insubstan-
tial.

In the KDIC incident women
were referred to as “weak” and
were told that it they were oiiend-
ed by the lyrics oi the song “I want
pussy.” they should change the
channel. The defense of the DJs
was that they have the right to iree
speech. They chided “liberals" for
being intolerant oi a culture-
specitic iorm or expression, rap
music. The apparent beliei oi the
DJs, that contemporary liberalism
engenders an acceptance or all
forms oi expression and action
within the constraints of the law, is
simply ludicrous. Contemporary
liberalism DOES involve value
judgments. it does make distinc-
tions between what is right and
what is wrong, Denigrating
segments oi the population is
wrong, period.

Another recent incident which
relates to values and the drawing
oi lines was the Steinman appoint-
ment as social coordinator. Ap»
parently there was a misallocation
of iunds last year under Treasurer
Dave Day: there is evidence that
he cut himseli a check (a personal
loan) ior an unknown quantity oi
money, a sum named by Martin
Moon as $2500. Moon went to Jim
Tederman last fall when he first
learned oi the impropriety; accor-
ding to Moon, Tederman has since
changed his estimate, What does
this have to do with Dave Stein-
man? Dave Steinman was the
assistant treasurer under Dave
Day: one of the duties of the assis-
tant treasurer is to handle the
books along with the treasurer.
Thus, he should have seen that

something was wrong and blown
the whistle on Day. i learned irom
my senator that Greg Evans told
him that Steinman did not find out
about the loan until ”th or three
weeks beiore the end or the (spr-
ing) semester." That makes it
seem easy enough: Steinman
didn‘t blow the whistle in those
weeks, and Day graduated. SGA
money was outstanding, and Stein»
man didn't cry ioul. Evans later
changed his story due to new inior-
mation presented by Steinman:
Steinman hadn’t known until early
summer. But he did not bring up
the loan in the fall; he countenanc-
ed Day's actions. But this
unethical behavior was not an
issue; it was his ability to do the
job that was under review.

No one stood up and said, “Hey,
this guy is a crookl What the heck
is all of this debate about?” In-
stead they voted for or against him
based on whether or not they
thought he was the best person ior
the job, without knowing who the
other candidates were. No one felt
comiortable saying to iellow
senators that Steinman should
have been canned on MORAL
grounds; no one ielt comfomble
about making value judgments on
another person’s actions.

Why can’t we be comiortable
about making such judgments? We
no longer have a ioundation upon
which to make them. Certainly
there are exceptions. Those oi us
who believe strongly in religious
dogma oiten make such
judgments: abortion is murder,
war is wrong, etc. But any oi us
cannot derive a consistent set of
values irom religious dogma, and
are left with nothing in its stead,

What strikes me is that our ac
tions and decisions determine who
we are, and that we are the ones
ultimately responsible ior them
Would Mozart have become a
great composer if he had blown off
his piano lessons? He could have
sat around and whined at age 35
about how he didn’t feel fulfilled,
but the decision not to act (prac-
