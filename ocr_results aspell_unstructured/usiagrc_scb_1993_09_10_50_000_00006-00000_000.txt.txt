A Better Idea on Our Policy
Towards Gays in the Military

A Personal Opinion by Howard Horn

 

 

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton recently announced his plan which would
allow gays to serve in the military The press has dubbed his program
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” which essentially means that military recruiters
are notallowed to ask about sexual orientation, and homosexual military
personnel must stay in the closet if they wish to serve.

The military is a bureaucracy which places heavy emphasis on
subordinates supporting superiorofficers. Lying is something thatcannot
be tolerated, This policy calls for military personnel to dojust that, and
merefore creates an messy paradox.

In order to clean up the mess,I have come up with a better program
thatallows gays toserveopenly in the military. It is simpleand only subtly
different from the program the military has used the past 40 years or so.
Icall it "Ask, Tell, and Discharge.“

When a potential recruit fills out the forms and surveys in order to
enter the military, a question they will be asked is: “Would you object to
sewing with openly gay, lesbian, andbisexual personnel?” If the potential
recruitanswers tliatquestionaffirmatively,itwouldbeautomatic grounds
to reject the application and that person would be forever banned from
military service,

But the military cannot simply expect all their potential recruits to be
honest. Therefore, misconduct towards gays would also have to be
punished. This would require the officers to report any misbehavior in
their ranks. For example, if a marine is caught making a “gay" joke,
calling something bad “gay," etc. he would immediately be courtr
martialed. If a courtrmarualcd person wtshed to dispute the claims made
against him, the military would spend tens ofthousands ofdollars in legal
fees to prove guilt, whether that person was guilty or not. Ultimately.
anyone wtth homophobic tendencies in the military would be dishonorr
ably discharged.

The aspect I have named above would make my policy a definite
improvement over any policy America has implemented in the past. It
allows gays to serve with pride (as they do now), and it allows them to do
so openly and legally. Unlike any other plan, mine would punish
homophobia instead of homosexuality, Finally, it allows the military to
concentrate on ﬁghting the enemy instead of itself.

Don’tblameBillClinton on thecurrenlpolicy on gays tn titcmilltztry;
Congress gave him the option of“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" or nothing, and
hedid the best possible. The problem is with some ofsociety’s perception
that there IS something wrong with being gay. In the future, America will
look at homophobia retrospectively with saddened embarrassment. Unr
fortunately, America cannot operate retrospectively.

 

 

After attending the sexual
harrassment workshop and listening
very closely and carefully to what
was discussed, I have come to a most
disturbing conclusion: studean are
being told that it's OK to be raped.
Women are told that if they don't
explicitly say “yes" to a titan when
engaging in sexual intercourse, then
they have been raped, In fact, they
are practically being encouraged to
invite a man into their room, turn the
lights off, get undressed, engage in
heavy petting, lay there without my
ing a word, express sortie hesitation,
havesexandthcndeterntincthatthey
have been raped. Certainly, I am not
trying to say that a woman doesn't
have the right to take a man into her
bedroom and do whatever she wants
with him. Nor am I trying to suggest
that she can't say “no" at any time.
She certainly can. And men should

beconscmncious enough toslop when
asked to stop. However, the advor
cates do not attempt to teach women
what I feel to be the most important
thing: Being raped is horrible, it is
awful,itis hideous ttndoneshoulddo
whatever is in one‘s power to avoid
situaLions in which rape is likely to
occur. Although rape is certainly not
the ftiultof the victim, ifonc fails to
use common sense. they must suffer
the inevitable emotional consc-
qucnces. The analogy is similar to a
person who leaves thousands of dol»
tars of stereo equipment unattended
in an unlocked room while they leave
for a few hours and is subsequently
robbed.

Certainly the fact that the hypo-
thetical person did n0l take care of
their belongings does not diminish
the severityofthc crime thathus been
committed. However,this hypolhclir

cal individual is still without Ih
equipment. Sim' 1y, a woman w

Tocveryone thatmakcsGrinnell such
a special place:

Iattendodclassesthissummerttt
the University of Iowa and I realized
something about Grinnell. Beyond
the madness, Grinncll is a very spe
cial, unique community.

One of the reasons I went to the
U of I was to experience a different
campus (although not the ﬂood).
Well,theUniversity orowaishugcl
They have aJoumalism Department,
their own television station, and a
dorm that makes Norris look like a
quaintlittlecottageinthe woods. But
those weren’t the only differences
between Grinncll and the U ofI.

At Grinnell, I was used to smil-
ing at people as they walked by. At
Iowa,pcoplelookcdatmeweirdwhcn
I smiled at them. There is a certain
unity in the Grinncll community, At
Iowa, you don’t know ifsomeone is
a full-time student, a part-time stu-
anl,0rjuSlhttnging out. AtGrinnell
my pictureis on my ID. At Iowa, the
only identification on my ID is my
name and social security number.
My ID looked like a credit card.

To put succinctly, I love Grin»
nell and what it is. Thank you every
