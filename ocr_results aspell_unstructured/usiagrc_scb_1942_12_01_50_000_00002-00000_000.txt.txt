Tim e O u+--—

Benny Douglas has called a time out in this
game of life. Tile game is by no means
overgjust one of those unforseen events
that change the course of a man’s life has
colne up and Benny has responded in the
manner which he sees inost fit We agree
with him one hundred per cent.

With the opp sition throwing a heavier
team into tlle f 'ht than first strategy
counted upon, there have to be more coaches
to train the reserves we are going to put
in to counter and eventually drive the on
position off the field. There is no better
man for the job than Ben Douglas. He has
had the experience in the pinches that will
help him draw the winning combination
in this, the greatest contest he has ever
coached. .

Typical of the man was his departure.
Although he knew what his plan of action
was, true to his profession, no one else did.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Not until the last minute did the word leak
out that Ben was Navy bound as a lieutenv
ant, j g. He left Grinnell Sunday morning
at 8:17 with a few friends to bid him
adieu. That’s the way Benny wanted it. He
came to Grinnell in a whirl 01' publicityi
not of his makingi He called time out at
the critical period and left—he being his
own substitutioni True, this whistle has
blown for a time out for Benny at Grinnell.
But we can be thankful that the interval
is only temporary When his job is done,
future Grinncllians will hf le Benny back
teaching- them from his enriched experience.
To them we say, you’re lucky. To Glinnel-
lians now, we can say, “Your’rc lucky yoll
knew him,” Good luck, Benny

No Smoke In Your Eyes---

Will you pardon lls while we mention some-
thing- that has been very much on our
minds these last few days? A number of
things have brought it to our attention, but
there’s really only one angle to the story,
and since we would rather not bore you
with too many details, ue’ll he brici’, tele-
graphic in i'ac’t: CAREL SSNESS WITH
FIRE—WATCH ITi ‘

\Ve’v all become a bit lax about the
no smoking rules in certain college buildings
lately. You know we have. You also know
that this is not the time to have another
building of today become an ash pile tor
morrow. Moreover, such catastrophes re-
quire only one match, whether it is a
match thrown toward a girl’s hair in the
“rec" room, a match lighting cigarettes of
faculty members in ivoodsfurnished ofﬁces,
a match scratched on the wall of the
Women‘s Gymnasium during last Saturday
night's house party. Quite frankly, we get
the jitters remembering the lovely little
bonfire we had three years ago, plus the
fact that while four hundred people will
make up a ,very cozy group almost any-
where, the absence of a particular four
hundred in this particular place would make
a very sizeable hole.

 

lCanalidly Speaking. . . . .

There's Co. 'A' . . .

There's a certain feeling of kin»
dred spirits when the Candidates
preparing to march to class look
out the bcrrack Windows and see
the Grinnell coeds trudging back
from their morning hike. It’s just
one hike after anotheriin or out
of the Army Candidate
Elswnrtll w. Niemann, it is re-
ported, was never a men to

omihlc duty each evening at the
College library, Candidate Thomas
w. McHugh studies on the double

order of coffee and finally doubles
back to the Women’s Quadmnglc.
But now comes coffee rationing.
Two hot chocolates. please , . . .

WAAC F'LAK: It has been
definitely established that Candi-
dates Jerome Ci Patterson, Paul
Cohen, Robert E. Doughty, “'ar-
ran in Rommel and Richard P.
\Vick traveled to Dcs Moiiics to
inspect uniforms. Sure, and the
inspection was confined mostly
to the \VAAC variety . . , . The

The barracks area always did
look rather bustling with activity
with so many soldiers hurrying
around on their tasks. But, the
arrival of Company C has brought
the ,peak load to Grinnell. And
do the new boys know that there
is a Women's Quadrangle? Just
ask chem!

It's remarkable the way Candi.
date Harry E. \Vatson caught on
to the drift of the Visual Aids
discussion. Under blackout condi-
tions he asked for visual aid rath-
er than the lights . . . .

Candidate Willinm Hi Abing-
ton's ,pcrsciial grspevi’ne had it
in the recent largo call of csudi-
dates that “We're all gonna get
our diplomas two weeks early"
. . Every falling out for forma-
tion is now known as “malercall”
as distinguished from the happiest
sound to a soldier's cars: “mail

the quadrangle? . . . . According
to Candidate Shapiro guard on
Thanksgiving was nothing to be

thankful for Does that
"overall picture” we so often
hear of also refer to the "denims"
sported by our collegiate gals?

One stops and wonders at a
name like “Gene Foley-Gilmsiclu'n
That boy, Nap Hardeuherg, who
reminds one of a cup of Lea . , . .

How the expression “Candidate

in Co. B lecture halls. Or Candi-
