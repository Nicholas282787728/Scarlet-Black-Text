Schlusnus’ Distinction Comes
in Realm of Lied,
Says Blum

By PROF. ELIAS BLUM
(School of Music Instructor)

The second program of the Grin-
nell School of Music recital course
was given by Heinrich Schlusnus
Monday evening in Herrick chapel.
His is that rare gift of an extraordin-
arily beautiful voice, coupled to a
keen artistic sense, dominated by a
powerful personality,

The immense resources of the
voice, from the loudest, though never
unpleasant, fortissimo to the most
delicate pianissimo, were always un-
der perfect control, and used with ex.
cellent taste in the interpretation of
the songs.

Distinction in German Lied

His chief distinction is undoubtedly
in the realm of the German lied, and
no higher praise can come to any
singer. The two groups chosen from
that class gave a wide range of con-
trast, from the highly dramatic to the
most tender lyric. or particular note
was his rendition of the “Atlas" of
Schubert and the “Serenade" of
Brahms.

The group of Shakespeare songs by
Quilter naturally suffered by compar-
ison, as any modern group would.
Nevertheless it was a pleasure to see
that evident care had been taken to
master the English diction, some-
thing so rarely found in our visiting
artists

The two opera numbers gave am-
ple evidence of a superior ability in
that capacity also. This was particu-
larly true of the Messenet “Vision
Fugitive."

Collegiate Players to Fete

Initiation Rites Will Follow

'ne Grinnell chapter of National
Collegiate Players will hold a dinner

dinner, and afterward the initiation
ceremony will take place at the home
of Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, direc»
tor of the Grinnell drama department.

The initiates are Ruth Bauer,
Faith Somers. Alice Jewell, Dorothy
Loring, Robert Swift, and Margaret

'Elizabeth Blagg, instructor in zoology
at Grinnell college, had uncovered an
old book which advocated the heard
not for ornamental purposes but for
its scientific values, was to send her
it complete set of literature regarding
the “the world's greatest invention in
shaving devices."
Advertisement Unanswered

Miss Blagg, while doing some re-
scarch work for her zoology class
which was studying respiration, came
across the book, “Home and Health,”
which was owned by her grandfather.
The author maintains that the beard
keeps the body warm and clean, and
acts like a modern ventilating plant.

The propaganda in , farm of the
beard, which was brought to light by
Miss Blngg, has been used as the has-
is of many stories which have been
appearing all over the United States,
and which were used by The Scarlet
and Black and the Des Moines Sun-
dey Register last week.

Although Miss Blagg foresaw the
dangers of using such statements.
she hardly expected to find an adver-
tisement from a razor manufacturing
concern requesting her be "try just
once" their incomparable product,
But because Miss Blagg is one of
these scientists who know what they
are talking about, the razor adver-
tisement will probably go unanswered

Mrs. L.M. Conard, lecturer in soc—

spoke Monday night at Oskaloosa to
a group studying international rela—
tions on the subject, “National Ideals
of other Governments," Among other
Oskaloosa people, the group included
several Penn college professors. The
home of c. F. Stanley, state senator,

Cub Preachers Club Holds

Survey Shows
More Students
Finish College

21.5 Per Cent Grinnell Body
Lives Out of State;
866 in 1922

That thc quality of college stu»
dents is steadily reaching a higher
level seems to be indicated by an
analysis Of the enrollment of Glinnell
college during thevpttst decade, in the
last ﬁve years of which the Senior
class has had a growth in numbers
despitc a slight falling off of sopho-
mores and juniors, and a cor-opera—
tively slight gain in freshman en-
mllment.

This trend seems to be supported
by statements of Various faculty
members that this year’s freshman
class is the best in Several years.

More Transfers

These ﬁgures indicate, the report
shows, that more students ﬁnish their
four years of college work than for-
merly did, and also that a larger
number of students are transferring
from other Schools to Grinnell to ﬁn-
ish their college work.

The survey, which was made by the
statistics Class of the economics de-
partment, also shows that the num-
ber of students from states other
than Iowa is growing and now totals
21.5 per cent of the enrollment. The
greatest individual increase is that
of Chicago, which this year nosed out
Omaha for third place among the
cities and towns represented in the
student body here.

Grinnell City Has 34

Chicago has sent 30 students to
Grinnell this year. The town of Grin-
nell is ﬁrst with 84, Des Moines is
second with 50, and Omaha, in fourth
place, is represented by 28. .

Grinnell was the ﬁrst college west
of the Mississippi river to admit Wom-
en to its regular courses. The survey
shows that for the entire decade Cov-
ered, 1920»30, women students have
outnumbered the men.

Since 1910 the total enrollment has
varied from 620 in that year to 866 in
1922-23, the high mark. The Changes
in Class enrollment during the last
ﬁve years show an increase of .8 per
Cent in freshmen, a decrease of 2.4
per cent in sophomores and 1.5 per
cent in juniors, and an increase of
5.2 per cent in seniors:

Room Condition

Prize Divided
by Gates, Smith

Gates and Smith halls won first
prize for the best kept clubroom and
building as a whole, and the first and
second awards were divided equally
between the two. They were the win-
ners of the prizes last year.

The third prize goes to Building
'I'nree, which also won the third prize
last year. The amounts are 325, $15.
and $10, and are contributed by Louis
v. Phelps, treasurer. The award
stipulates that the money Shall be used
for something lasting. for the build-
ing as a whole.

The awarding committee consider.
ed the condition of the building and
clubmom end the pro rata damages
of the buildings. The most significant
fact in the award is that the average
pro rate damage for the six buildings
has been reduced 62 per cent in one
year. In 1929 the highest pro rata
damage for one building was $3 95:
that building in 1930 had only $1 pro
'rata, damage, and the lowest in 1930
was 50 cents. -

How great is the economy may be
seen in the fact that in 1929 the
average of the buildings was $2.61,
and in 1930 it was only 51 even. All
the buildings have shown great ime
provemcnt in care, and indications
are that it will be harder to make a
fair distribution of the award at the
close of the year.

MINNEAPOLIS‘With Coach Dave
MacMillan back from his scouting
trip to watch the St. Louis university-
Iowa game Monday night, basketball
work began in earnest at the Uni—
Versity of Minnesota fieldhouse
Tuesday in preparation for the Grin-
nell game here Saturday night.

The battle against South Dakota
State was a pleasant surprise for the
Gopher mentor. Although Minnesota
was expected to win the contest handi—
ly, it was not expected to make the
surprisingly Strong 5449 showing it
did. The team appeared much
stronger than anything the Gopher
fans have seen on the floor in the
past decade. Smooth, short passing,
and quick shots featured the evening's
work, and it appears that at last
Conch MacMillan has a squad ideally
suited for his type of play.

Expect Herd Evening

Minnesota has a rangy, speedy
squad with plenty of weight and ex-
perience, However, the Gophers are
primed for the fight of their lives
when Grinnell comes here, as the
Iowa boys had a crack aggregation
last year which did not hit its stride
until late in the season, and with the
same outfit back, the Gophers expect
a herd evening.

A new candidate reported for his
initial workout when Al Kreszowski,
200 pound football end, turned out to
fight for the center berth. Kreszow—
ski has everything from a physical
standpoint, and if he can demonstrate
his ability at the center post, Coach
MacMillan’s worries will be lessened
considerably.

All—Conference Guards

Don Bondy and Glenn Bethe! have
been performing at center thus far.
Bondy is a veteran and a great man
under the basket, but he is not a
natural jumper and for this reason
will doubtless have trouble against
faster competition. Against South
Dakota he turned in a fine game, but
against the speedy Grinnell boys he
may be handicapped by his lack of
natural spring. Belhel is an ex-
cellent shot, but is rather slight for

Graduation Requirements
Include 120 Grade Points;
‘D' Allowance Aholished

Increase in credit requirements for
graduation was announced this after-
noon efter the change had been of-
ficially passed by the faculty, at its
regular meeting Monday afternoon.
The new rule will go into effect with
the present sophomore class.

In addition to the 120 hours required
for graduation, the new requirements
call for 120 grade points. This is an
average of 15 points a semester, bBSe
ed on the present system of three
points for each hour of A, two for B.
one for c, and none for D. The max-
lmum allowance of 30 hours of D has
been abolished with the new dosage.

The adoption of the new credit re-
quirements by Grinnell is in keeping
with the policy of other colleges and
universities. The System is elastic,
and makes it easier for the transfer
of Credits.

The Lantern meeting will not be
held tonight, but will take place Dec.
17, James Clarke, secretary, has an-
nounced.
