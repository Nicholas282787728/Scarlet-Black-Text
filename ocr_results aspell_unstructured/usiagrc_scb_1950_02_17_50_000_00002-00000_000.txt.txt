On the Grinnell Beach-head'

There are certain sul'e signs of Spring. On this cani-
pus they include dandelions, blankets, alld complaints about
the sidewalks Springs come and springs go, and we seem
still to slosh through ankle-keep puddles, leap large muds
holes, and stumble on boardless boai‘dur’alks.

There is undoubtedly good reason for lack of cement
walks criss-crossing campus wherever our fancies seem to
take us. The permanent design of the campus will elimi-
nate the barracks and will include other central campus
buildings. Naturally, the routing will follow them,

BUTsthat plan is a long run plan. Meanwhile, thaws,
rain, sleet, and snow make merely getting to class a ho
ardous matter. Last week one girl slipped while puddle-
jumping her way homeward from ARI-l; she came up from
a wet tumble with a sprained ankle and a broken bone in
her foot. -

In the barracks area, pregnant women must step ging-
erly to avoid tripping over absent boards. Even if the barn
racks are not there to stay, the boardwalks must be made
a normally safe place to walk. At one time a plan was pro-
jected to pave the area—housekeeping providing the ce-
ment, veterans providing the labor. It went the way of
many good plans.

It isn’t an unreasonable assumption that ARI-l is here
to stay. Would it be too much to hope for in asking for a
sidewalk to take the place of the depressed channel which
now leads from the southeast door? Besides bones, we
might even be able to make a substantial saving on shoes.

As for the mire between the barracks and the wom-
en’s tennis courts, a load of gravel or a few well placed
planks could save time, leather, and laundry to say nothing
of the inconvenience of walking around the greater pools
and cleaning splashed trousers and skirts

Defying the tradition and sure signs of spring, may we
suggest a change in the campus scenery. Gravel the roads
where students must cross. Replace broken and breaking
board walks. Andiif it isn’t beyond the realm of all rea-
son and hope, put cement sidewalks in the barracks area
(where men are willing to do the work) and on the well-
worn paths to south campus. Dramatic as it may Seem to
say it, they may Save life and limb.

The Central Committee

The Central Committee of the
Student Council is the main ad-
ministration body of Grinnell
Student Government. its 13on
ers and duties, quoting Nancy
Wolfe, are “to take adequate
measures for the proper admin—
istratlon and enforcement of the
policies and regulations of the
Student Council.” Composed of‘
the president of the Council of,
House Presidents, the President
of League Board, the President
of the Student Council, and two
members Each from the Fresh»
man, Sophomore. and Junior
classes, it has broad powers of
appointment. »

It can appoint and remove
(hold your breathi): the Stu-
dent Union committee, the stu-
dent Pep committee, Gadabouls
chairman and his two assistants,
and chairman of the Fetzer
Sing, managers for the two
campus cleaning agencies, and
the student auditor. The last
two must be approved by the
laculty committee on student or-
ganizations. ..The Central Com—
mittee also appoints represen-
tatives to the Faculty Commit-
tee on Student Organizations,
the Buildings and Grounds
Committee, and the Concert and
Lecture Series committee.

Further, the Central Commit—
tee administers Spring and Vic-
tory days, and, with the Stu—
dent Council, and the Organiza-
tions committee, allocates se-
master fee money.

Since the Central Committee
has such broad powers, the Fac-
ulty Committee on Student Orr
ganizations acts in an advisory
capacity.
