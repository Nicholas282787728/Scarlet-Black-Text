it is impossible to do justice to the topic
oi‘racism in Latin America in one short are
ticle. But. perhaps 1 can comment on a iew
oi my experiences as a black American
living in Latin America and outline some
oi my impressions oi the blacks I saw and
met in Costa Rica and Colombia.

.Latin American countries are diverse.
As you travel irom one region to another
within a country. or irom one country to
another. the racial makeup oi the area
changes along with customs and language
dialects. With a iew exceptions most
blacks in Latin America live in certain
aneas of the countries.

In Colombia and Costa Rica the majority
oitblacks live along the coastal areas. The
black population is also diverse. For ex-
ample in Colombia there are the black
Palenque and then the black Costenos or
coastal people. The Palenque are descenr
donts oi runaway slaves who iormed their
own communities outside oi Cartagena.
colombia. and speak a language which is
comprised oi Spanish and Airican
languages.

.When i traveled to Cartagena l was in-
terested in visiting the Palenque cums
munity l was told by one Costeno that 1
would not be able to understand them
because he barely could. The Palenque are
n sically considered the only Colombian
b acks that are “pure Airican." They
roiuse to marry outside oi their small com-

unities. However. I did meet a man. San-
tander. who told me his mother was lndian
and his iather was a Palenque.

bia are the people living on the island of
San Andres. The island oi San Andres is
nestled between Nicaragua who once con-
tested ior ownership) and Colombia. San
Andres was once a British protectorate —

oI the tourists are white. so they assumed I
was from Latin America. In tact. some
people were surprised when I told them
that I was a North American, I am not sur~
prised because 1 know tor the majority oi
Colombians. North Americans are either
tourists or movie stars And Since blacks
are invisible in America. as tar as the
movie industry is concerned. it is no sur-
prise to me that people thought I was from
somewhere else.

There is one image of blacks that is ins
vading Latin America and that is
breakdancing. “Breakin” and
“Beatstreet” were two oi the most popular
movies in Colombia. Children from Bogota
to Cargagena are breakdancing and wear-
ing some oi the breakdancing iashions
What most young Colombians get irom
“Breakin” and “BeatStreet” is not the
social protest that is clearly heard in rap
songs and brought out in the plot. but the
dancing and the clothes.

There are also racist stereotypes about

mm
Rica 1 was showing my “mother" and her
friend a picture of a dancer friend of mine.
He was in tights. and the picture was in
terrible iocus. They assumed he was
black. although he was white. When I ask
ed why. they giggled and pointed to his
crotch

My AFS mother in Costa Rica made
statements about the black coastal popula-
tion. assuming they were lazy and uiieves.
in my Bogotino iamily I heard some oi the
same. “Be careful oi the blacks in Car-
tagena!” My sister Amanda nonchaiantly
warned. “They are all thievesl”. not to
mention they all looked alike and oi course
they are all lazy, One night my Sister and
brothers were telling ethnic jokes about
the Chinese and Indians but when they
remembered l was present they dropped
the black jokes

In comparison the attitudes toward his
dians are probably worse than the at-
titudes about blacks. Many Bogotinos are
sensitive to questions about their racial
makeup. I got the deiinite impression that
it was nota good idea to ask anyone if he or
she had Indian blood. No matter how dark
the skin. many Bogutinos consider
themselves to be Spaniards Indians are
considered uncivilized and have the lowest
position in Colombian society.

My mother once said to me that the im-
pression that Norm Americans had of Col-
ombians were that they were “just a bunch

of Indians! ” and that North Americans did
not realize that. Colombians (Bogotinos)
were “civilized" or European. The Worse I
heard was the derogatory exprssion “Que
Indio!” roughly translated it means
“What an Indiant”. This expressmn is us-
ed as a putdown.

Another form of racism I saw occurred
at Ben Poste. a community ior homeless
children. There was one little. black boy
whose name became “Negro." Although
he was liked and had friends it bothered
me the way the children dragged him out
and displayed him to me as one oi my col-
or. I noticed that everytime they wanted to
tease him they would refer to his color. his
blackness and then make racial jokes.

Two things came to my mind. one was
that when I was a Child dealing with the
racism of white children in the integrated
schools. I had tools. given to me by my
parents. on how to react and deal with
racism. Unlike “Negro" I also had the
reiuge ot the black community where i did
not have to be the only black child and
where I was isolated from white racism

It is problematic 101' me to discuss the
social manifestations of racism. in terms
oi discrimination in employment. housing.
etc. It is very obvious that in both Bogota
and Costa Rica the majority oi the blacks
are poor. Many Latin American scholars
assert that this is due to class and not to
race. Nonetheless. historically the position
of blacks is due to race,

I do know that racial discrimination is 11*
legal in Colombia and Costa Rica,
However. in the United States these forms
of discrimination exist despite the laws. It.
is important to note that in Bogota there
are no “Black communities” and black
racial issues are not a part of national
politics as they are in the United States.

The Airican iniluence in many parts oi
Latin America is profound. Blacks in Latin
America have inﬂuenced art. cuisine‘
religion. dance styles and language. From
colonial times to the present. blacks have
been involved in government. business.
the medical and law professions. and the
military. In some instances. blacks have
been absent from Colombia history. For
example. Colombia has had one black
president — but don’t look ior him 7 all
the statues and paintings oi him have a
white lace!

In discussing my experiences as a black
American living in Colombia I do not. want
to give the impression that all my ex-
periences were inﬂuenced by my race My
experiences were human ones with racial
dimensions. There is so much more that I
would like to say about the Latin American
countries 1 visited and so many things that.
I learned that will be with me iorever,
