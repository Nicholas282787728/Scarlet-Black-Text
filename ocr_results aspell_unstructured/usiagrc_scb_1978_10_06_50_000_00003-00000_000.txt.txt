 

Grinnell DNA

by John Strauss

The Grinnell College science
building may appear to be just
your average edifice of knowledge,
but the research that went on there
this summer is reminiscent of the
experiments done in the
laboratories of such great scien-
tists as Louis Pasteur and Dr,
Frankenstein,

While this might be a bit of an
exaggeration, it is true that
Assistant Professor of Chemistry
Elliott Uhlenhopp did come upon
some startling and significant
results this summer while studying
the effects of xerays on DNA
molecule size.

PREVIOUS measurement of
DNA has been Concerned with only
small DNA molecules.
Uhlenhopp's study concerns large
DNA molecules, Using a protozoa
called Tetrahymena. Uhlenhopp
and his two assistants, seniors Ed
Fry and Won Young Cho, observed
that after heavy dosages of x»rays
DNA is broken into small parts but
it eventually rebuilds itself.

The team useda technique called
viseoelastometry to measure the
size of the DNA An electron
micrograph prints out various
curves and lines which can later be
mathematically computed to find
the actual DNA size.

IT WAS AROUND the tenth week
of research when the study team

Business not as usual

Unknown to much oi the campus

population is the existence oi a
business program at Grinnell.

Since the second semester of
187748, Grinnell College has
participated in an arrangement
with the Keller Graduate School of
Management in Chicago. through
which students can enroll in in-
troductory business courses and
also work in the “real world" as
interns with various Chicagorbased
companies,

The program is intended for
juniors and seniors who have
completed introductory economics
and who have an in-
terest in exploring any career in
business. The opportunities
available are as pertinent to pre-
med and prerlaw students as to
economics majors, since at some
time in their post-Grinnell careers,
many students will either work for
a business or market their own
skills as a private enterprise.

THE FORMAT OF the program

 

observed what is now the focal
point of the research. Once broken,
DNA repairs itselfmbut, in the
process of being rejoined, larger-
than-normal DNA molecules are
formed. “The molecules are bigger
than the ones we started with This
‘overrepair’ has never been ob-
served to our knowledge—there’s
no reason why thcy should
overrepair,” explains Uhlenhopp.
According to Fry, once they had
observed this process, ”the study
was drastically altered." Says
Uhlenhopp, “We just sort oi
stumbled upon this over the
summer , , . it had never been
anticipated and now we're in the
process oi explaining why it
happened." He adds, “Nobody has
ever encountered this before "
THE RESEARCHERS do have
one hypothesis The Fry
Hypothesis explains the overrepair
as an overstimulation in the cell
repair mechanism and inhibition in
the recombination system of a cell
This may explain why the cell
eventually returns to normal after
six to 12 hours. .
Uhlenhopp has been working on
the project for the past five or six
years. He made about half of the
complex equipment used in the lab.
Most of the work must be done
during the summer and during
breaks because the study
necessitates so much time,

includes an initial ten»week
segment in which the student
enrolls in three courses at the
Keller Graduate School of
Management.

At the conclusion of the class
term the Student enters a five

pany. Internship opportunities

'range from market studies to

hospital administration to data

Student interns usually have some
positive participation in the host
company, and specific responr

A representative oi the program,
David Pasahow. Director of
Placement, will Visit Grinnell next
Thursday to speak with any
students interested in the program

team makes finding

Uhlenhopp finds himself in a sort oi
“limbo" being unable to iollow up
this semester with the research.
The team, however, will be
working over iall and Winter
breaks.

Uhlenhupp's iunding comes irom
two sources He benefits from
a chemistry department grant
from the National Science Founr
dation's undergraduate research
program and also from a personal
grant from the Research Car
poration, a group which unr
derwrites graduate research.

While the team has observed
something never before seen and
which could be potentially
signiiicant, unlenhopp is humble.
“We’ve exaggerated the i
portance of the research if
gotten as far as the 5&3. We think.
however, that it is a genuinely
significant finding. . , (or radiation
biology," Since the researchers
stillhave many tests to do, they are
cautious. As Uhlenhopp states,
“it's not going to change the
worldiit's not even going to
change the department or the
college for that matter."

THE RESULTS of the first series
of tests will be published in the

“good for the whole faculty," Dean
Walker calls every iaculty
member's concern about writing
“truly liberal arts.”

A number oi students. uneasy
about the writing component oi
tutorials, suggest alternative
systems such as a required four
credits of English or small writing
seminars in place of—or in ad
dition toithe tutorial. Freshman
Lynn Rossman realizes the college
is “trying to avoid dull and boring
standard required English cour-
ses" but recognizes the benefits of
some so! of requirement to
further improve writinE skills.

THE CURRlCULUM Council
recently suggested that in addition
to the tutorial, freshmen should be
required to take a designated
writing course during their first
year. Also the council feels that
more emphasis should be placed on
oral presentations in the tutorial.

emphasizes. “There is nothing to
prevent a student from getting all
the writing instruction he needs on
this campus."

Opposition to such a Humanities
ioi requirement seems to outweigh
the desire for it. A major benefit of
the tutorial system, many feel, is
the diversity of course offerings.
This, according to Jones, gets
faculty members involved since
they Choose their own topics. In the

ALSO. SINCE students select:

more likely to be enthusiastic
about the class than about a

to have every student take

Since they were given ”free reign
oi the lab” Ed and Cho designed
their own experiments in con-
sultation with Uhlenhopp. Ac-
cording to Ed, the summer was
quite ditierent irom the normal
school year “We were treated as
grad students and although we
could pretty much do things the
way we wanted, it was expected
that we pursue the problems
seriously and take an active in-
lerest in the research itself."

believes Walker.

The advising component of the
tutorial system, according to
Jones, “aims to meet the need for
closer faculty-student relation
ships“ since a no-requirements
curriculum is heavily dependent on
advising, Various freshmen find
tutorials particularly effective
from this standpoint “It's a good

 

relationship, I feel close to my
adviser.” says one. They also
emphasize the necessity oi a small
class.

vising Ray Obermlller calls

One common problem with
tutorials is the lack of motivation
on the part of students, Although
only seven to ten freshmen a year
fail the tutorial, Walker calls the
lack oi motivation the program's
“greatest weakness prior to this
year."

ALTHOUGH. As sophomore
Kristi Falkner asserts, “It seems it
you choose a topic you‘re in

says, “A lot of people take ad-
vantage oi the system and don’t
'work as diligently as they do on
other classes," One freshman
,admits that since it is not a
tregularly graded class, motivation
may be relatively low, but, he
points out, it takes some pressure
off of a treshman's “adjustment to
:college life."

Last year, the curriculum

not taking the tutorial seriously

OBERMILLER SAYS the bulk of
professors want to teach a tutorial
and enjoy the challenge and the
unique student-faculty relation-

regarded as one of the hardest

Clotfelter, due to the unfamiliar
