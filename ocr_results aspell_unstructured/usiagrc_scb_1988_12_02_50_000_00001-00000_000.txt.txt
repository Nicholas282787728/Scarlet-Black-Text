Liason explains police role on campus

by Laura Momn

Grinncll Police Officer
Larry Bush. acting policc Ilason
to the college, spoke at Wednes-
day night's SGA meeting. In
light of recent confusion over the
Haincs third incident, Officer
Bush had been asked to speak to
the SGA in order to clarify any
uncertainties about the role of the
police in their interactions with
Grinnell College.

"First of all, I want to say
that the idea that ‘Campus is off
limits‘ couldn't be farther from
the truth," Bush began. "The
college is handled just like any
place in town .. if we get a call,
we will investigate it to the best
of our abilities."

About the Haines third in-
cident, Bush said that the police
could have obtained a search war-
rant for every rooln on tile floor,
since the controlled substance had
been discovered in the hallway.
In looking for drugs, Bush said,
"(The police] can look in every-
thing and anything." This would
include everything from purses to
dresser drawers. Generally. as far
as searching the person goes, he
said that the police seldom go fa-
ther than a "pat" swrch and mak-
ing the suspect empty his or her
pockets. However, if they have
reason to believe that the suspect
has the drug on his person. a
strip Search (in the presence of an
ofﬁcer of the same sex) may be
mnducled.

Search warrants, Bush said,
can be obtained relatively easily,
taking “half an hour to an hour.
max," depending on the
availability of the judge. They
can even be obtained over the
phone. It is, therefore, possible
for police to obtain a warrant af-
ter receiving a complaint before
actually coming on campus.

The ofﬁcer also said that if
a warrant is obtained for a quad or
triple and an illegal substance is
discovered, the officer involved
has the right to arrest all of those
living in the room, "unless
somebody wants to admit it's
theirs."

If the police observe a

breach of law from outside a
home or room (for example, if an
officer notices that a student has a

he does have the right to enter
and arrest the student without
needing a search warrant. Once
the officer has entered legally, he
can arrest the student for any visA
ible offense.

Possession of a controlled
substance is generally a simple
misdemeanor, punishment for
which is 30 days in prison and/or
a $100 ﬁne, which is up to the
discretion of the judge. In order
to elevate the charge from a
simple misdeameanor to a serious
misdemeanor, it must be shown
that the those in possession of
the illegal substances are
intending to disu-ibute them. For
example, if the marijuana has’
been divided into several quarter
bogs, it can be assumed that the
owner was intending to sell it. A
large quantity of a controlled
substance also suggests intent to
sell.

"If you've got a pound of
marijuana or a kilo of coke or

something it probably shows that

you‘re intending to do something
else with it," Bush said, imply-
ing that few people have kilos or

pounds laying around for personal
use. He stressed, however, that
deciding on whether or not to elr
evate the charges, "depends on
circumstances"

As far as alcohol, Bush said
that police are well aware that
numerous minors frequent the
Bar. He also added thatpolicc are
aware of the number of fake Iowa
IDs on campus. "We've gotten
ten, I think, so far this year," he
said. "I understand that last year
someone broke into the state
DOT facility and stole some
equipment, using it to make fake
Iowa IDs in a bathroom." In view
of this incident, if someone is
discovered in possession ofa fake
Iowa ID, they can not only be
suspended frotn driving for six
months and be charged with a
simple misdemeanor, but can
also be charged with being an rte-
cessory to last year's crime.
Other states have different poli-
cies concerning fake IDs. Most
include a temporary loss of driv-
ing privleges and, like Iowa, the
charge of a simple misdemeanor.

Laws for being in bars are
as follows. Anyone 18 or over
can legally be in a bar, as long as
thcy are not buying or drinking.
The police can come into a bar at
will. and if they see a suspected
minor with alcohol anywhere
within arm's reach. they have the

right to take him out of the bar
and glve him a brealhalyzcr. The
prcscnce of .0] percent alcohol
allows them to give a simple
misdemeanor if the party is under
19 years old; if 19 or 20, the
party would receive a 515 dollar
fine (with court costs totalling
anout $30) but, if found in
possession of a fake ID, the
guilty party may have charges
brought against him.

If convicted of buying at
coho] for a minor. the guilty
party faces a serious misde—
lneanor, the penalty for which is
one year in jail and/or a $1000
dollar fine. If the party for whom
the alcohol was bought is 19 or
20. it is merely a simple misder
meanor.

Bush concluded by
explaining the role of the liason
officer. He is responsible for
helping students and faculty unr
derstand the law. When there is
any kind of trouble requiring po—
lice assistance on campus. he is
usually the officer assigned.

"Each incident has different
guidelines," Bush said. "You
can't write one policy for all
situations."

Faculty contemplates curricular revisions

by Dave Jones
The Executive Council
Subcommittee on Curricular Rey
view this week called meetings
with the faculty of each academic
division to discuss four proposed
models for curricular revision.
Although the models are very
general and do not necessarily
indicate the direction which the
possible curricular revision will
” take,theSubcommitteepmposed
them as a means of starting dis-
cussion.

The faculty consensus is
that they are most interested in
discussing“general education def
fined as what a student takes that
is not part of the major." accord»
ing to the memo sent from the
Subcommittee to members in
each division of the curriculum:

the humanities, sciences and so
cial studies.

In their meetings, the divir
sions discussed the following
models:

1) A curriculum based on
upper-level seminars. This
model would call for a required
seminar at the 300 level, mken
during thestudent’s junior yearor
first semester of the senior year.
It would be mostly interdisci’
plinary in nature and perhaps be

be taken outside of the student’s
major and would be based on a
collection of prerequisitecourses.
with at least one at the 200 level,
Because of theprerequisite struc-
ture, students would need to be»
gin planning for the seminar in

their freshman year.

2) A curriculum based on
three courses which all students
would take. The three courses
would be: rhetoric and its appli-
cations (Texts); mathematics xii-id
its applications (Models); and
imagery and its applications
(Forms). 'I'he’fexts coursewould
probably be taught by staff from
the humanities and social studies,
the Models course by science and
social studies, and the Forms
course by faculty from the art and
music departments.

3) A twostaged replacement
of the present tutorial. In the
first semester, students would
study “the Cultural Heritage
without apology." There would
