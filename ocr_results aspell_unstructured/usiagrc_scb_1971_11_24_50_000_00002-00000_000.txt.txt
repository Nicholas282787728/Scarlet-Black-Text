the individual professor in terms of
his teaching.

The problem most emphasized was
the problem of getting a statistically
viable return. Last spring 45% cithe
questionnaires were returned,
whereas closer to 30% are needed to
give substance to the results.

The “Hamilton Committee“ pro-
posed that this be done at registra—
tion for the subsequent semester.
There were several reasons for this.
Last term a number of question-
naires were lost when the forms
were to be filled outin class because
a number of classes had no final
meeting or exam. The new method
also eliminates the problem of stUr
dents being inﬂuenced by the pro»
fessor while ﬁlling out the form and
removed the issue fromthat particu»
tar academic context. Some faculty
felt it was advantageous for the stu-
dent to have received his grades
prior to completing the evaluations.
Others questioned this reasoning,

claiming that the knowledge or
grades is a definite bias that will
be incorporated in the responses.

The report itself stated several
qualifications on the interpretation
of the questionnaires in terms of
using them for personnel decisions.

Responses Relative

For each professor, the responses
from all his courses over Several
semesters should be pooled when he
is being considered. All evaluations
must be made relative to the faculty
as a whole, in other words, ageneral
rating of “Above Average” only has
meaning in the context of ratings of
other professors. This is only a
relative and not absolute rating. It
was also noted that the question-
naires gave no indication of the
teaching effectiveness but were in-
dicative of students' impressions of
their professors.

The questionnaires do not have the
validity to be the key factor in per-
sonnel decisions, but do serve as a
valuable student input.

The Scarlet and Block

Thefts Create Muior Problem

by Don nagenais

Last year a very valuable violin,
owned by a student, was reported
missing from the Fine Arts building,
This year twopaintings, onefrom the

‘ Scheaffer Art Gallery .and another

from the college‘s permanent coir
lection, have been stolen. Students
have reported missing equipment,
such as instruments and amplifiers,
from Fine Arts.

The problem of stealing, whichhas
been on_the rise the past two years,
particularly in the Music and Art
departments, is not unique to Grin-
nell. “i was at an ACM conference
in Chicago recently," said Pro-
fessor Richard Howe, Chairman of
the music department, “and other
institutions are going through the
same thing.” .

Other colleges have lost so much
equipment that their insurance has
been cancelled, “or the premiums
are so high that they yust can’t carry
it any more,”

The college’s own insurance situa-
tion may be put in jeopardy by the
problem should it continue.

Tough to Replace

Around $2000 worth of equipment
has been stolen from the music
department last year and so far this
year. Most of it has been small in-
struments, sound equipment, and
percussion apparatus. “The budget
is so tight,” said Howe, ”that we can
only replace something ifit’s some-
thing we have to have right now."

Last summer a piccolo was stolen,
but since the college has noneed for
a piccolo right nowthere has been no
replacement purchased. ”But if we
find a good piccolo player next year
and we need a piccolo, we'll have to
get one.”

Howe estimates thatif all the miss~
ing equipment were replaced, it
would eat up about half of this year’s
equipment budget. And the first
semester has not yet ended.

lrreplacable Paintings

The art department has not had any
increase in stealing of equipment
this year, and “it’s been a pleasure
that we haven’t had more,” said de-
partment Chairman Louis Zirkle,
“although of course we don’t want
any." The big losses have been in
paintings.

Worth 3300

Two of the college’s paintings have
been stolen already this year. One,
from a Schaetfer Gallery display,
was only a small work ‘worth about
SS.’ But the other was a large oil
painting stolen from the college's
permanent collection, “which was
worth at least $300.”

No Pressure Al
Revolving Door

The Revolving Door has seen no
signs of academic strain on campus
this year. According to Linda Du-
mont, the case load this month seems
to be about the same as in previous
months. She does not know of a sin-
gle case where students have men-
tioned that they are overworked.

ing?” In any case they are irre-
placable.

Library Losses

The library has also experienced
substantial losses this year, as re
ported in a previous son. Thomas
McEee, manager of the book store,
says, however, that his shoplining
losses have notbeen higherthis year
than usual.

Equipment For Sale

The music department's real
problem is ligurihg out who istaking
the equipment, and how to get it back.
“I have absolutely no reason to be
lieve that (people stealing the equip-
ment) are from offrcampus,” Howe
said. “Students 1 have talked to have
said that there is a lot of sound equip-
ment up for sale in the dorms.”

in actuality there is little way of
identilyihg the music department’s
apparatus The identiticution stick~
ers are easily removed, Thedepart~
ment has a record of some of the
serial numbers ofthe equipment sto-
len, but even so it is difficult to
locate exact pieces. And on at least
one occasion this year newly-pur-
chased equipment has been stolen so

fast that the department did not even
have time to make a record of the
serial numbers. Besides, a lot of
students have the sametype ulsuund
equipment which the department
purchases, Howe notes.
Some of the equipment has been
anonymously returned, although
“not much,” Howe admitted.
Peer Pressure
“1 think there is a lotofpeergroup
pressure not to report a theft,” he
said. “Students are confused, and
they don’t know what to do when they
find out that somebody has stolen
something. We should clear the air
about the ethical issue. Personal
theft is one thing. but people some
how don't feel so badly about steal»
ing from an institution."

Final First
Semester 5&8

The next issue of The Grinnell

will be the final edition of the
semester,

long Flag Debate Concluded

(The College has reached adecision
concerning the ﬂags on central cam.
pus. Both the United Nations andthe
American ﬂags will be ﬂown at full
must, but blackstreamers will adorn
the top of the American ﬂagpole asa
sign ot mourning. The lollowing
letter trom president Leggett and
Mitch Erickson is addressed “To
the College Community”.)

After discussion by the Student
Government Association, mem-
bers of the student body in
general, and representatives of
the faculty and the administra-
tion, a decision has been reached
with respect to ﬂying the United
States ﬂag on central campus.

As the campus community is
aware, the flag has for the past
two years been displayed athalfr
staff on the pole situated a
short distance to the west of the
Forum. The decision to maintain
the flag at half-staff came after
(1) n Grinnell student in the spring
of 1969 had inverted the ﬂag asa
symbol of the “dire distress"
visited upon the United States by
the Vietnam conflict and (2) the
suggestion of Governor Robert
Ray that all American ﬂags in
the state be flown at half»staff
whenever an Iowan was killed in
Vietnam.

During these two years students
were exploring means by which
the college could show that it is
interested not in the continuing
national emphasis on war as our
operative policy in Southeast Asia
but rather in the coming together
of peoples in peace to achieve
some measure of harmony and
fellowship in the world. Some
members of the student body
thereupon approached the presr
dent of the college and requested
that the Board of Trustees con-
sider the college’s joining the
Associatlon of World Colleges
and Universities as a means of

demonstrating the institution’s
desire tor peaceful modes of be—
havior in international affairs.
The Trustees approved this pro-
posal and Grinnell became a
”world College” earlier this
year.

One of the requirements of this
association is that the member
institution fly the United Nations
flag on its campus as a symbol
of the willingness of the college
to join with its fellow members
in the pursuit of international
peace to which the United Na-
tions organization is dedicated.
Under these circumstances, the
College wished to fly both the
United States and the United Na—
tions flags side by side and has
proceeded to have two poles for
the new flags erected a short
distance to the east of Herrick
Chapel.

After much discussion on cam-
pus and consultation with state
and federal officials, it has been
decided that both flags should
be flown at the top of their staffs
and should be of equal size, as
provided in the flag codes or the
United States and the United Na-
tions. To continue, however, the
visible sign of mourning (in the
absence of the flag at half-staff),
the American flag will have two
black streamers placed at the
top of its staff as respectful
marks of tribute to, and concern
for, the Vietnam dead.

In accordance with these con-
siderations, the new nags will
be displayed as of Thursday, 25
November and we urge that all
members of the campus com—
munity accord them the respect
due them as symbols, not of the
worst, but of the best that people
can do in their aspirations ior
justice, peace, and fellowship
in the world today,

Glenn Leggett, President
Mitch Erickson, for SGA
