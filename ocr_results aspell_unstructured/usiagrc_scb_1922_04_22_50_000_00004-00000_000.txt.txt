Initiate Seniors
to Mysteries of
Chapel ServiceI

; To the tune of “Here Come the Fio—
necrs" the members or the Senior
class wcrc initiated into the mysteries
oi the college chapel service Friday
morning. To those familiar with the
term pioneer, no explanation is neces-
sary as to why this song was chosen
for the occasion. For those untamll-I
lar with an exact deﬁnition of the
term, it might be wellto explain that,
"a Pioneer is one who ventures into
unknown teii—itory to prepare the way
tor others '1 The most perplexing
problem involved, is why those whoI
were termed the pioneers by those re-I
joicing in song came in last.
No doubt there are many who willY
take, issue with the poor little cub
who observed that the Seniors were
making their initial appearance in
chapel, but take into consideration th'
ﬁnal and conclusive evidence: .the
senior men did not know enough to
take on their‘hats in chapel until
Proxy gave them a tip. They are good
at taking tips. There is no such can-
Iclusive evidence to prove that the wo-
men were also making their initial
bow to the chapel-going puhlic, but
then we have our opinion. We might
question the iight or these so called
digniﬁed seniors to subject us to the
emharrassment oi observmg both mellI
and women in bathrobes, I
