Dr. Kohn- -

Continued from page 1

The Smith professor pointed out
that the Germans always live up
to the Nazi ideals, but that the
English do not live up to the
English ideals. What England
and France are trying to do is to
meet the Germans force by force,
but there is nothing but oppres~
sion in this world by use of fore ,
he said.

”Wars settle things, but the
question is, how do wars settle
things?" No one is fighting this
war for frontiers; it is being
fought for a way of life, asserted
Dr. Kohn. He pointed out that
this war is not being fought
against the will of the English
people but against the will of the
English plutocracy. He believes
that the English can speak their
minds as freely as die Americans
can or more so. Prime Minister
Chamberlain of England was
ready to receive a compromise,
and still is; but the people know
it cannot be. .

“The crisis we face is the dis—
crepancy between international
co-operation and the realism of
individuals. There is no solution
for this crisis," he said.

;in conclusion, Dr, Kohn stated
that the United States has been
designated by fate to play an im-
portant role in the interdepclldr
ence or nations. It is now up to
us. he said, to choose which road
we will take and how we will
carry out the responsib ty we
have.
