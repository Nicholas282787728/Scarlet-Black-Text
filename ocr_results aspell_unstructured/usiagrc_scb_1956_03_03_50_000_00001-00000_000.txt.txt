has been a real plcasurc and privilege tor me to have the oppor-
tunitv to work as a choscn rcprcscntative oi the students with our
present college administration and taculty.

All in all. this has bccn a very succcssttil year tor the Coun-
‘cil and its accomplishments have bccn many and varied. Those
things tuliillcd and achicvcd may be considercd in three Cate»
lgnries. although they may over‘iap somewhat.

l First. there is the catcgory oi matters which are tlic duty

oi cach Council to tuliill. Such events as the nctzcr Sing. Spring

, Day and Victory Day are staged very successfully. Those persons
chosen by the Council tor the campus social positions have

Then there is the larger category ct accomplishments in the
area of revision and crcaticn. This includes revision oi the Coun-
cil constitution which was streamlined by the crcation ot By-laws.

sponsored which proved to be so succcssiul as to have possibly

tion of multitlavoi sott drink machines. At dilicrcnt timcs during
the year. the Council has also scrvcd as a sounding board or stu-

The third category covers those matters with which the Coun-
cil is currently conccrncd, This includcs the taking oi more steps
