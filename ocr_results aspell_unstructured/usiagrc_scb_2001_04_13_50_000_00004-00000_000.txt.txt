Why the Academy shot itself in the foot

Joseph Michaels explains why he thinks the best movies were overlooked for awards and nominations by the Academy

By Joseph Michaels

Okay. so G/nt/l/llm wait-red away with the Best Picture pnre,
Julia Roberts got crowned Best Actress, Russell clowc got his
due, and double directing nominee Steven Sodcrbcrgh beat
himself and upset favorite Ang l. . Everyone‘s happy, the
awards are done, and we can all pack i n
until nest year, right? Not so fast. in e
many people out there, i was not com»
pletely satisfied with this years awards, not
to mention those nominated, Sule the
year offered a weak seleerion, but there
were still enough ﬁlms out there to choose
from, some of which were even nomi-
nated. Here’s a closer look at some of the
bigger awards including who won. why
thcy\von,whoshould havewon,andwho
should have been nominated.

Best Actress

Sadly, Julia Roberts's win this year was virtually preordained.
Going into the Oscars, she was the one sule thing America's
leading lady finally getting whet she deserves and all that drivel

has mellowed our over the years, but then how don one ex«

mances and used the past to reward the
present, albeit lesser. role (hey, the same thing basically hap.
pened with Julia Roberts) The problem is, his was not the
most deserving performance. 1 would contend that Javier
Bardem's mark in Before Nig/ir Far/r as a persecuted gay poet
should have received the award, but his ﬁlm was too little and
didn't receive enough attention from the Academy to give him
the momentum to win. Furthermore, the Academy's omission
ofMichael Douglas (Mndnant) and Mnlt Ruffslo (Yeti Om
Conn! 071 Me) was a grave misfortune. Riiffalo, hailed as a
modernday Brande for his work, sadly hatl very little ehance
with his small film in an already crowded category.

Best Director

This is a messy category Teshnically, the year's most deserv.

note that the Academy felt Tmﬂt‘t was the best edited. hest wne
ten, best directed, and among the best acted films or the year
(having won Best Editing, Adapted Sereenplay. Director, and
supporting Actor), yet they did not feel it was the year's best
him. That honor they bestowed on Giuliani; a throwback to
the spearelhmwlng spectacles of the ‘50: and ‘60s in a year
that featured little Innovation in film, the Academy felt it safer
to embrace a proven formula and handed its top yard to a
speeraelewith Ilttlesubstancc. The prohlem is, this epicdoesn't
even hold up to the best ofits genre (such as Bc/xJ‘Im', Spar/(1.7m
or even Brannon). Why a ﬁlm such as mﬂir that had some.
thing to say or s genrceredEI-mlng film sueh as Clem/ling Trglr,

not how long will it be before the Academy voters aelsnowl
edge their error, and will it prevent them from repeating the
mistalte in the future?

100 years ago the debating union held its first debate, now a
century later Grinnell once again will host Washburn University,
the opposing side in that first debate, in a CENTENNIAL de-
bate. The topic is Resolved: You’ve Come A Long Way Baby.
On the Government side is Washburn arguing for the expansion
of gay rights and on the Opposition, Grinnell College, being
represented by Aaron Wright, Sherman P. Willis, and Gabe
Rosenberg. Come take your place in Parliament (audience) and
vote, make a speech, or heckle. (Rah! Rah!)
