GUEST MUSIC CRITIC

Rick Rubin, piotliicerofthe Red
Hot Chili Peppers, the Beastie Boys,
Run DMC, and Slayer, recently told
the aging baby boomer magazine
Rolling Stone that “the most punk/
root thing you could do righr now is
play folk iiiiisie." Rubin’s point is
that it's not easy any more to bclieve
that a banrl playing irarlirional piint
is really in it tor the rriiisieewirh

Kissain's decidedly leftist politi~

his music. His choice of traditional
