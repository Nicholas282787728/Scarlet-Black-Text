Viewing voyeurism

Summer Blonde isn‘t a tropical getaway but it is a break from your text-only course packet

levor Burton always told me that i could go onywhere or be anything
by tokrng a look in a book. Sadly, the good Lr. Geordi LaForgc missed o
crucial pleasure otreading: Ward-ling other people doing anything, Comic
writer/artist Adrian Tomine recognizes
rhnt voyeurism is very pleasing judging
by the cover orhis new short story col.
lection, strrwmrr Elam/z. A gmyrgreen
slrpcover hides everything except o cirr
eulorcutoutorblonde'sguizmiglanee.

The tour stories in Summer Blond:

which he has been making since he was
in high school To pny for his pencils

Arean draws commercially ror T/ItNm/ low/err, Rolling Stone, and, most
famously, chzcr. Yes, an artist with a book on buriing‘s shelves drcw rhnr
poster with the two superhero girls. summerslowde, however, is n much
more personal ereotion than those serrbhles for Rivers Cuomo.

Tominc cieorly drnws upon what he knows for his Comics. All tour
stories are varying shades of urban outcast youth possessing too much
intelligence yet looking social skillsia chorecrersketch that hrs Grililtcllims
perfectly, The ﬁrst story, “Alter Ego," is about a critlmliy nccinnned bur
uninspired writer, He receives ran mnil horn who he thinks was his high
school crush, and goes home to invesrigote. lt ensily eould he on epilogue
to the collections issrsrory, “Bomb scare," nboutasrxualiyrapnrhctlc high
school loser' who nhandons his lone friend, the elm rnisonrhrope, to hong

out with t girl who recently stopped being a jock party pleything. The
other two stones, “Summer Blonds" shout a than trying to share a mo-
rnentvvith the photo-processing girl and "Hawzllan cetowny' about a girl
driven to depression and prank phone
calls by her overhcsring parcnrs, are
just as somber and, sodiy, redisrie,
ermmt’r' Boone‘s stories ore ens.
ilv the longesrTonrrne has written to
dnte. Many stories in his previous two
eolieetions, Sllrpwtlll’ and 32 Starla,
last one or two pages, yet are fresher
due to their constant turnovers. These
tnlesoreiustns‘slreeorhre,” hursrea
hit dmwn our. and don’t end grace»
fully,

Adrian's on, conversely, is balleric. His black and white line art
is photogrophierlly erisp yet simple onel uncluttered, it lacks n dynnrnie
rhythm and pace henveen penels out many times the arresting drnwrngs
strengthen the nsrronon and droiogue. The stories ‘i‘onrine tells would be
shdlower in any medium besides eornie.

Grimtcll students should be Adrien Tomine’s core audience. We're
snrnrr, bored and disenrrnnchrsed nnd selnshly like to read shout people
like us, but ern't eornrnit more then two hours to n book. Srimlm‘r Bland:
may not be Tornine’s best work, but it is o greut olttrnntwe eornre rhnr

Can’t focus through two shows in one night?

Two Chicago-area hip-hop groups will try to keep you happy in this weekend's showcase

Sidewalk Skolaz, I.L.
Friday, Feb 20 am pm. in Gardner Lounge

Usually the most boring part or a concert is when you’re waiting
around between sets for the next band to come on. The lights come up,
someone turns on music entirely unrelated to the group that was just
playing and some odd minutes later a different hand comes on and starts
setting up,

but a dirrerent breed or concert is coming to Gardner Lounge this
Friday night at 9 pm. Instead of having just a hip-hop show, the concerts
committee is bringing a hip-hop showcase to town.

The difference is a matter of format. Usually at a concert, the hands
play distinctly different sets, But hip-hop groups It and Sidewalk skolaz
have a different idea on the way things should be. Instead of performing
separately, theyll let the pertormantes meld together, playing off each
others acts and hopetully letting the sets blend together in a style that's
more like a hiprhop party than a formal concert.

Both LL. and Sidewalk Skolaz are from the Chicago area underground
hiprhop scene. sidewalk Skolaz is one or the oldest hip-hop groups in the
area and has been performing sin:21988.Tlie duo is compn'sed of MC;
Beat Daddy Fish and G Spot.

ﬁsh is a prominent member orthe Tllinois underground hip—hop scene,
and is the founder ofa monthly showcase Called Respett the Microphone.
The monthly event takes place at a chicago club called The Note and is

meant to both provide a forum tor up and coming hip-hop artists and a
medium ior changing common negative perceptions connecting hiprhop
to violence and greed. rish wants to expose more people to hip—hop so
that people can ”see all orthe positive things in hip-hopy all or the
creativity"

LL, became tamiliar with Fish's ”showcase" format through pertorming
in shows at The Note. The group is a much more recent invention by MC:
Neptunius and Lyncil. The two came together in 1999 after a
longstanding triendship based on a mutual love ot hiphop. rheir most
recent creation is an EP called ”Just a iaste," which came out last
summer.

Currently, LP. is working on a single with a group called Longshol, as
well as preparing to work on their tirst fullrlengtli album. The work
theyve put out so bar is impressive, The song “Hard Times Fade Away is
an emotional tour de torce, lyrically expressing despair and deﬁance
simultaneously with an uncommon depth and talent. ”Recital or the
Illesl” is a less original self-plug, but in both trucks the rappers setup a
smooth and hypnotic verbal cadence.

In a way, on rnday Gardner lounge will become an experimental lab
ror underground hip-hop runner and lyricism that promises to be worth
healing. it and Sidewalk stooz will be trying to turn concert sensibility
on its head by turning the typical ratio or dead time to show time into a
nonstop party with no boundaries.
