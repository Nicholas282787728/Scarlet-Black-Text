BILL
WALKS

By Toleab nger

SEEINGtheworldfromthe botr
tomwas something newforBill.
It was refreshing.

Bill tried to tell his new par-
ents that he wanted to watch
T.V. but all that he could say
“Goo-Gee—Gee—Goo—Ga—
Gee!" This was so frustrating.

But life was pleasant. His
parents loved him. All he had to
do was be cute and play Peek—
ArBoo.Butahermonthsofnothr
ing else, Bill got bored.

So Bill started to try to be
able to stand up and balance
himself on his feet. Day by day
he got better. He could do it
without holding on to any1hing.

Bill was so excited. "This is
cool." thought Bill.

Then Bill remembered how
to walk. He put one lootfontvard.

Boom!

Bill forgot about gravity.

l-[E thought of interviewing a witch fora

I newspaper column may sound comical

to someone who’s never meta witch like

Phoebe Lostroh before. But if I hadn't been to
Rediscovering the Goddess last fall,l may have
imagined myselfsitting down in the Forum with
a gray haired woman who carries strange crea-
tures in her pockets and talks in mystical rhyme.

Phoebe looks like your average college stu-
dent: no huge wart on her nose or strange green Lint
to her skin. In fact, there‘s nothing all that mystee
rious about her or her ideas. She’s very sincere.
level-headed and very eager to talk about her
beliefs. The beliefs themselves that we talked
about seem very down to earth, and in fact quite
realistic.

Phoebe is from a very small, conservative
town in Nebraska that“makes Grinnell look likea
metropolis." She went to high School there until
she was a junior. She then uansferred to an
international schoolinNew Mexico. She explained
this was Where she met her ﬁrst witch ata discus-
sion group on witchcraft. At the time she was an
active United Methodist. Although the ideas of
witchcraft interested her a great deal (panicularly
because of its feminist inﬂuences), she disagreed
withalotof the idealsbocause they conflictedwith
her Christian beliefs of a single dogma. It took her
about a year and ahalfbefore she becameactively
involved.

We talked about the concept of magic, which
she explained wmewas the idea that all things are
connected. If people believe in these connections
then they can also learn to control them. One form
of simple magic, she explained, is just hugging a
friend when he or she is sad. This kind of magic
happens all of the time. A witch (as well as many
peopledtatdon‘tconsiderthemselvestobewitches)

realizcs that this simple act perpetuates
goodness.
Phoebe explained that for a while
she didn't believe in the idea of magic
because of her scientiﬁc, rational back
ground. Butshcclaims that heracademlc
focus on molecular biology actually re—
cnforccs hcrbelicfs inmagic.She laughed
and said “Anyone that has gotten a genete
lcs lab to work right won't argue with
that.”
Sheexplained thatbocomingawitch
has helped her focus on her rclationswith
other people and has given her a useful
way of looking at the world. She ex-
plained a very magical experience she
had in which she was having a miserable
day and shccamcacrossabcautiful stick
that caught her attention. From this she
realized how even when things get hor-
nbletherc's still a lot ofbcauty all around,
even in something as simple as a stick.
The idea that this stick was there for her
to see is part of what this idea of magic
and connections in the world is all about.
Another story she told me described the intent
of witchcraft and the irony of peoples misconcep-
tions. She explained thatonecoldrainyday Phoebe
and her friend were walking past the Community
Centerin town. Someone had left theirear lights on
so she and her friend decided that they would be
kindandﬁndtheowner.Theycventually foundthc
person in a meeting inside the Community Center.
The people were all very thankful and very im-
pressed at Phoebe and her friend's kindness. It
turns out that the meeting was about the evils of
paganism, warning people tobeware of the occult.
The people never found out about Phoebe’s be»
liefs, but it does seem quite ironic that a witch
showed up at their door to help them.
Phoebe said that most of her high school

ENC mm?

classmates from Nebraska would probably claim
that she has lost her mind getting involved with
witchcraft, but Phoebe claims that she has instead
found it.

Phoebe may not have the ﬂuffy pink dress,
bubbly velce or the ability to send homesick girls
back to Kansas with the click of their heals but she
docs portray the image of a good witch that has the
powertoperpctuate beauty and kindness. Whether
or not you believe in this sort of magic, by getting
to know Phoebe and understanding her, you will
realize the strength that comes ﬁ'om living by her
sort of beliefs.

If you would like to know more about witch-
craft, Phoebe holds weekly meetings Sundays at
7:30pm. in SteinerHall,Room305. Sheisalways
very open and willing to discuss her ideas.

 

 

Energy conservation options explored

 

By Craig Hooper

RINNELL College is tenta
G Lively moving toward an en
ergy conservation program.
Shive-Hattery Engineers and Archi»
tects, Inc. of Cedar Rapids and Engi-
neering Design and Management Inc.
of St. Louis are nearing completion of
energy audits that will suggest mea
sures to reduce Grinnell's overall en-
ergy consumption.
Theproject,sponsorcdbyGrinnell
College, the Iowa Higher Education
Loan Authority’sPrivate College En»
ergy Bank Program, and the Iowa
Depanrnent of Natural Resources, is
due to becompleted by early March.
A preliminary 1992 audit of
Grinnell’s global energy consuming
systems by Engineering Design and
Management Inc. gives an indication

of what the two conttactors will sug-
gest in their new audits. The first audit
suggested improvements that would
save the college $50,775 (1990) per
year. The report recommends an int4
tial capital investment of $387,535.
and suggests that the improvements
willpayforthemsclvesafter7.6years.

The preliminary report recome
mends that the campus modify its cen»
ual hot water heating system, modify
miscellaneous temperature control
systems in Norris Hall, Fine Arts,
Burling Library and theFomm, modify
the PEC pool dchumidiﬁcation sys-
tem, and make modiﬁcations to air
conditioning systems across campus.

In conjunction with Iowa State
University, Grinnell is beginning to
explore new lighting options by re-
placing fixtures with compact or high
efficiency florescent bulbs whenever
possible. 1023 Park Street has, on an

experlmental basis, been completely
convened to llorrscent bulbs, and is
providing data to explore the feasibile
ity ofcxpanding the bulb replacement
program. AssociateDiroctorofI-‘acilie
Lies Management Phillip Schupbach
wishes tocxpand theexpcrimcnt tothe
Macy-Stoops House by thenext ﬁscal
year, and may improve Camegic Hall
lighting as well.

“We‘re waiting to see what kind
of bills we accumulate over the next
couple of months," said Schupbach.
“If that turns out to be successful we
will probably convert Lhe other off
campus houses and possibly a few of
the office houses."

In an effort to gather a long-term
energy consumption data base,
Grinnell has moved to provide each
buildingwithltsownelectrlcity meter.
“How can we know how productive
we can be with effective energy con-

servation unless we know exactlywhat
we are consuming in each building,"
said Schupbach.

The college is slowly linking
buildings into either a computer net-
workor into automatic timing devices
at a cost of about $50,000 a building
The devices save money by allowing
Facilities Management to fine tune
supply with demand. “We don‘t need
to generate the same amount of hot
water at night as we do at nine when
everyone is taking a shower,”
Schupbach said.

New buildings also come with
their share of new conservation innoe
vations, but they are often cut as the
buildings go over budget. Both Vice
President of College Services Waldo
Walker and Schupbach agree that en-
ergy conservation is not a high priority
in the construction and remodeling of
the college’s buildings.
