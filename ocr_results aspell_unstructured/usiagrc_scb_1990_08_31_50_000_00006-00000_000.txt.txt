Brazil's Strange
Visual Odyssey

By Jennifer Mattes

Even though Terry Gilliam
finished directing Brazil on
schedule and within budget,
MCA~Unlversal executives never
theless descended on the film like
a pack of vultures, demanding
final cut. Although edited heavily,
the version of the film that
eventually gained wide release re»
tains the basic theme and vision of
its director. The struggles of an
individual against a Kafkaesquc
tangle of bureaucracy inform
Brazil's plot.

SamLowry,playedbyJonalhan
Pryce, is a government official
who accepts a post at Information
Remeval so that he can locate
a mysterious woman who
appears repeatedly in his dreams.
The dreams themselves are
fantastical, allegorical episodes.
Lowry symbolically battles a
monster representing the bureau»
cracy that besets him in his daily
life. Imbued with wings and a

sword, he becomes a valiant fairy
taleknight. Itircallifehe becomes
catatonic.

Brazil is adislanltropical locale
which represents the dream state to
whichallwanttoescape. The stul-
ttrytng frustrations of the Orwel—
lian world in which Lowry exists
finally propel him down a mental
corridor ofinsanity. As the film’s
poster itselfsiates, Brazil is “a state
ofmind,"

Gilliam is the most wildly
imaginativedirt-ctorworkingtorlay.

Lowry'smenlalstalesandhisbleak
daily existence. Dangling, twist-
ing, pulsing pipes are always in the
way. They dominate interiors and
entangle the characters therein. A
particularly su’iking visual image
occurs early in the ﬁlm, when
Katherine Helmond‘s countenance
becomes a grotesque piece of
stretched mbber. as a facelift sur»
geon yanks and tugs at the flaps of
her face.

Robert DeNiro makes an entcrr
raining, concise impression as a
plumber who efﬁciently disposes
of symbolic industrial tangles. He
is an unflappable, practical pres-
ence at odds with the disorienting
confusion of his surroundings.

Appropriately. he is later overcome
by a whirlwind of red tape and
paper. Never before has a film so
effectively deleted an unwanted
character.

which will feature piano soloist
Margaret Lucia. The ﬁrst portion
of the piece is apiano concerto, and
the latter halfis similar to the "Ode
to Joy” hymn that Beethoven later
incorporated into his Ninth Sym-
phony.

Assistant Professor of Music
John Stuhr-Rommereim is the di»
rector of both Singers and Chorus,
This spring he will additionally
oversee a premiere CD recording
by the Chorus of Russian choral
composer Alexander Kasialsky’s
“Vigil.“ The tare-revolutionary sa-
cred choral music which Kostalsky
composed was later suppressed by
the Stalinist Soviet regime. The
Chorus will sing the piece in Old
Russian, and its appearance on CD
will mark the rediscovery of a rare
piece of music.

The first rehearsal of the Grin-
nell Community Chorus, which is
composed of faculty, staff, and
townspeople as well as students,
will trike place on September 3 at
7:00 pm. in Herrick Chapel. New
members are encouraged to audi-
tion. The Grinnell Singers, colnr
posed exclusively of students, will
also make an unprecedented trip to
the EnstCoast this spring semester.
