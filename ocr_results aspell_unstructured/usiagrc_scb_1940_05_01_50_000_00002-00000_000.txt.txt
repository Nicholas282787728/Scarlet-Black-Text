Rain, Rain Go
Away, -- Don’t

Return Sunday

By Jo smiili.

Rain may be the “fruit of salva-
tion” but who wants a grocery
store, is the way one coed summed
up the current wet spell which
has caused the present demand
for panchos in local stores.

For the last three weeks, the
ground, sidewalks, and dates have
been bogged down. As expressed
liy one man, ”I'm getting sick
and tired of taking a beautiful
girl out at 3 p. m and bringing
her home at 11, drenched to the
skin, hair hangln , make-up
smeared (by the rain), and. teeth
chattering And as for blanket
parties, you might as well tuck the
blanket on the shelf with the
sophomores and save them for
next yeal‘;the blanket, 1 mean."

.Anotlier prep girl has threat-
ened to transfer to the University
of New Mexico if the current
wet spell doesn’t leave us soon.
The iEssenbee staff has come to
onc conclusionitllat “April Show~
ers tiring May flowers,” but we
don’t need a greenhouse on the
campus. ,

Seventeen miles of shelves have
been added to the University of
Illinois lihrar They'll accolnm0<
