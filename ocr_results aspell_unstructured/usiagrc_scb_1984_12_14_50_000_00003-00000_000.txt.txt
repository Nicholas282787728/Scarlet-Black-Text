In my opinion. the branding oi

ductive in lcrnis at the sludcii '\

Certainly tor most students. one F
seems to lead to luck 01 motiva-

excel. It is tor these under
achievers. and possibly niisguidr
ed students, that negative reliir
lurcenient does not work. Here is
where an alternative system is
necessitated » a system ol
grading that takes into account
the individual and provides
him/her with instructive criticism
and guidance. not a scarlet letter
to wear with shame!

Positive reinlorcement using
as and B's in the current system
is indeed nioi‘L usetul than
negative rsinl'orcement.
However. positive reintorcement,
as 1 will shovv. can be more pro-
ductive in other lornis. That is to
say that primary reinlurccnient
thased on achievement. com-
petence. knowledge. and in.

The him centers around a small town vvluch is invaded by an alien

is a good movie. The stars include Kevin McCarthy and Carolyn Jones
