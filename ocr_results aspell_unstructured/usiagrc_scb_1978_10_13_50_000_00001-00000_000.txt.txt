seriual harassment plagues campus women

by Debbie Weincr

There have been an unusually high
amount of incidents of sexual harassment
on campus this year. ,

The police have several descriptions,
and are working wlth the college to track
down those responsible.

THE INCIDENTS range from flashing
to verbal abuse to following women on
campus. According to Director of Housing
Susie Wlttpenn, “We have had incidences
every year, but this year there is an
unusually large number all occurring at
the same time.”

At least two or possibly three males are
involved, One is 30 to 40 years old and
anotheris collegeraged. “It is possible that
one of the individuals is a college student,"
she says, The incidents happen at all hours
oi the day or night.

“FIVE 0R SIX times," according to
Wittpenn, a man has walked into a shower
room, ilung open the curtain, and ap-
pmred naked beiore a woman. After

standing there for a while he finally
leaves. This has also happened once or
twice in the women’s locker room in the
FEC.

One or more times a man has appeared
naked in the women’s bathroom in the
Forum. Also, there has been one report oi
a man following a Woman while she
was walking near Steiner Hall,

ALSO. IN ONE dorm, a male has walked
into rooms unannounced late at night while
the occupants were asleep. However, he is
a student know to people in the dorm and
has confined his “visits" to that particular
dorm, One female says that she woke up at
2:30 a.m. to find a man sitting on the edge
of her bed. ”It was someone I knew, and
therefore I did not act in an overt man
ner,” she says, Because she was half
asleep, she did not realize the full impact
of the situation.

One woman reports that as she stepped
out at the shower one morning during the
first week of school she saw a “guy
standing there with no Clothes on." She

asked him What he was doing there, “I told
him, ‘I don't think you belong in the
bathroom.’ I told him to leave." The man
left, and she then reported the incident to
the police and to her RA.

SUE DESCRIBES the man as “about
college age.” He was about 5'10”, Slender,
and had shoulder-length, curly light brown
hair

Last week a similar incident occurred,
After surprising a Woman in the shower,
the flasher said. “Now we’re even ”

A MAN FITTING the description was
detained in another dorm one Saturday
morning. A male living on the floor relates
that a female walked up to him and told
him she had just been ﬂashed. “She looked
pretty startled," he says. He accosted the
man, who was in the process of dressing.
However, as he smrted to dial the police,
the man took off. “The minuteI went to the
phone he went up the stairs and out. We’re
hoping he comes back again because this
time he won't get away,” he adds. “If i
saw him on campus, rm sure rd recognize

him.”

The man seen in the Forum bathroom is
30 to 40 years old, of heavy build, short,
with dark, thick hair and glasses. The
woman who encountered him says that she
noticed the person in the stall next to her
had “a pair of gigantic blue tennis shoes."
This made her a little nervous. When she
walked out of the stall, he opened the door
of his stall. “He was stark naked,” she
says.

AFTER QUICKLY leaving the
bathroom. she found somebody and then
went back to check the bathroom, but the
man had dressed and gone She then called
the police.

“I was so scared," she says. “Looking
back on it, I think there’s so many things I
should have done . . , Ten minutes later I
was so angry.” She is still apprehensive.
“My reaction has been pretty intense. l
worry about the girls on my iloor walking
home late at night from the library."

SHE IS BOTHERED by what she sees as

After three weeks of discussion
and turmoil Joint Board passed an

approved the basic “Herren
amendment" to the CSL proposal,
but defeated an amendment that
would have allowed SGA funding of
liquor for parties at cit-campus.

three dissenting votes came from
Mears, Cleveland and Norris.

Last night, the Committee on
Student Life voted to reject the
Joint Board‘s amendments. Both

SGA‘s policy now go to Dean Waldo

accepting one oi the proposals
or rejecting both and substituting

amendments as proposed by vice-
president Lynn Boughey. The
amendments allow that: 1) serving

hours he spent wedged in a crevice
while spelunking in Skunk cave‘s
animal run

Erspaner, along with four other
freshmen, was on his first such
outing, a GORP expedition under
the leadership oi Barry Litt and
Caroline Shultz, both experienced
cavers. According to Litt, the
“keyholetype” passage through
which Erspaner was trying to pass
wasespecially diiiicult: a “crevice
angling downward at forty-five
degrees which is so narrow that
one’s helmet must be removed
before entering ”

“lwastoldlo keepmy booyhigh
That’s What I thought I was doing,
but evidently it wasn't high
enough.” says Erspaner. In trying
to work his way forward. his foot
somehow twisted around un~

becoming trapped iurther down.
He says, “It was a very un-
comfortable position, to say the
least.”

Working planks underneath Er~
spaner’s rree foot ior support while
lifting him by the shoulders from
above came to no avail, “We
simply couldn’t get leverage in

“Although the experience was

IT WAS NOT UNTIL 2 am. that
Erspaner emerged from the cave
‘smiling into the iriendly search-
lights and the voices of the
numerous spectators and
emergency officials on the scene.
From there he was taken by am-
bulance to the nearby town of
Decorah for observation and
treatment of some minor bumps
and bruises.

Unloi-tunately though, according
to Litt. the memory of the event
might not pass so easily among
others. “This could have bad
ramifications, It’s conceivable that
people could start complaining and
that the cave could be closed, I
would rather see it as a kind of
freak accident. No one has ever
heard of anyone else being stuck
here. But these things happen,”

Erspaner has suffered no
permanent injuries and is even
entertaining some ideas of ex-
ploring the depths again someday.
