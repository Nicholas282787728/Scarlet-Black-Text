south in the fifties and sixties”
She told of a Native American
murder that the government
would not prosecute “because
it is only those Indians.” She
told ofwaiting in a store to buy
something, and the clerk served
everyone around and behind
her, not even seeming to see
her there. She told of total seg-
regation in all the restaurants
in McAlister, Oklahoma, which
is 40% Choctaw.

In her convocation talk, at
tended by about 150 people in
Herrick Chapel, Ms. Howe told
us aboutthe state ofIndigenous
peoples around the world. Basi-
cally, “Governments hold our
land and pretend to help
us...The [present] status of in—
digenous peoples varies from
one nation state to another na—
tion state, but often we are
treated as secondeclass citizens
oreven considered sub-human.
For example, under Brazilian
law, Indians are treated as legal
minors under the guardianship
of the Indian-Affairs agency,
which is charged with protect-
ing them from themselves The
pygmies of the Central African
Republic and Uganda are not
counted in these countries cene
suses because they are not con-
sidered part of the population.

“In the United States we have
the Bureau of Indian Affairs
[BIA, part of the Department of
Interior] who works as both
guardian and warden of has-
tages... Today 20% of our In—
dian communities have a waste
dump, either garbage, toxic,
hazardous, or nuclear waste on
their reservations or in their
community.

“Why would the federal gov-

tion in decision making, die
rect representation, states‘
rights, and bicameral legisla-
tures were all part ofthe Great
Binding Law of the Iroquois
Confederacy [how many of us
have even heard of it!?], dat-
ing back to the 14005."

I know that I suffer from a
vast ignorance regarding the
history and present reality
(and everything else) for Na
tive Americans and Indig-
enous People everywhere. But
I am amazed that the school
doesn’toffer any ofthe above
courses, nor so many more

ernment want to help place a
waste management system
among people who have the
worst health statistics, the low-
estemployment, and the high—
est suicide rates in the United
States? PROFITSJ”

And therein lies the story:
neo»colonialism plain and
simple. She told multiple stoe
ries of tribal peoples usurped
by corrupt Native American
functionaries of the federal
government. “Non-Indians
and a select few tribal leaders
get rich,” jobs are provided
for Federal agents at the BIA
and Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, for contractors, consult
ants, and for a few token Na»
tive Americans. For example,
Chief Martin ofthe Mississippi
Choctaw makes $150,000 per
year to deliver his tribal lands
to toxic interests while his
peoples’ per capita income is
$3,000.

She spoke movingly of Na—
tive American poverty and on
employment (covered to the
right) and of the Native Amerie
can belief that “we borrow the
land from our children and
grandchildren" But, she said,
she also can’t brook “Anthro—
pological ﬂattery” which “re,
fuses to let us move into the
real world.”

The talks were moving and
worthwhile. Kudos to the ad
ministration for bringing in a
Native American speaker and
helping to raise awareness re-
garding racismagainstand the
plight of Native Americans.

which one could easily think
of.

For the interested, LeAnne
Howe recommends: The State
of Native America, a book of
15 essays from South End
Press, edited by M. Annette
Jaimes, which addresses avast
array oftopics relating to Na-
tive American life and his
tory; her book, The Semgm
Foreigners, telling one spe
cific story of resistance to
wasteeimperialism; the books
ofVine Deloria, Jr., including
Custer Died forlgurSins,@
LSRKEQ, and Red Earth White
Lies.

The State of

Native America

When Columbus landed on
Turtle Island 504 years ago,
he encountered a thriving cule
ture of some 25 million indig-
enous people from hundreds
of different nations. Within
the first 15 years, “three mil—
lion natives died from war,
slavery, and labor in the
mines" (Utne Reader). In 1524,
the Native Americans were
taken as slaves and “exported"
to Europe Now, 1.8 million
Native Americans are left
(compare this to the opposite
population trends everywhere
else for an idea of the virtual
genocide), and they continue
to be treated with great dis,
dain by political leaders of all
stripes.

Presently, 33% of Native
Americans live below the pow
erty line (the highest level of
any ethnic group), 20% lack
home toilets, 50% have no
phones, and 40% are “offiv
cially” unemployed (this nee
glects discouraged and under-
employed workers). No ethnic
group has a higher rate for
diabetes and tuberculosis, or
a higher rate of increase in
AIDS cases. Indian teens have
four times the national sui-
cide rate (stats thanks to
Colman McCarthy, Washing
ton Post, 9—26-95).

Now, Congress has voted to

cut federal housing programs
for Native Americans by 67
percent, eliminate higheredu—
cation scholarships, cut 50
percent from the Department
ofEducation’s Indian program,
and decrease the BIA “base
funding accounts for tribal
governments.” Thus, none of
the BIA functionaries will lose
their jobs, but “they will gut
basic tribal self»governance
operations on reservations..."
(Post, 972695).

Since the first treaty be
tween the United States and
Native Americans in 1 61 3, 800
treaties have been made (370
ratified) and notone has been
honored As Colman McCarthy
puts it, “Social programs for
Indians are matters ofjustice,
not charity, largess, or the
dole... In exchange for hun-
dreds of millions of acres of
land ceded to the federal gov-
ernment, legal commitments
were made by Washington to
provide for the education,
housing, and health care of
tribal citizens. The obligations
were to last ‘for as long as the
grass grows and the mounv
tains stand’...." As LeAnne
Howe stated at convocation,
“America had a contract with
us first, and they didn’t keep
any of their promises.”

They made us

 

many promises . . .
they never kept
but one.

They promised to
take our

land, and they
took it.
