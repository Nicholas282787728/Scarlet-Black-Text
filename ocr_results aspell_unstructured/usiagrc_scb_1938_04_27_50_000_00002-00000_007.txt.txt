Examinations have been made easieriphysically, not mentally speak-
illg-for both student and instructor by the mechanical marker. 1t aids the
student by eliminating the essay examination. It aids the instructor by
grading tho examination papers at the iate of 300 to 400 per hour.

Each student uses a graphite peneil and a special examination shoot.
All he has to do is to make n neneil mark about a quarter or an inch long in
one of the ﬁve answer rolninns acmmvalwing each question. In the grading
machine, the examination sheet is pressed against 750 sets of eleetrio con-
tacts corresponding to the 750 answer positions on the paper. The pencil
mark on any of the answer 1) ions on the sheet eIoses an elee circuit,
and with the graphite at ng 2 the conductor of eurrent, the machine auto-
matieally records whether the answers are nglll. oi wrong. A (linl shows
instantly the number of answer.» the student got right and wrong.
