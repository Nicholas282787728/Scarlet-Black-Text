Ancient Rivals.

-

The Pioneers celebrated Armistice
Day last Friday by decisively defeat—
ing their old Cornell rivals by a 13 to 0
score.’ The game was played on a
ﬁeld covered“ with snow and with the
thermometer hovering around the
freezing point, but neither the snow
or frigid weather seemed able to chill
the spiritot the team or of the enthu ‘
astlc home coming crowd which gath-
ered to see the Fioneers make their
farewell how of the season to Ward
ﬁeld.

The Pioneers were on the offensive
throughout the game and were only
prevented from scoring oftener be—
cause of frequent fumbles which re—
peatedly spoiled almost certain chan—
ces to score. Again and again they
tore through the Cornell defense only
to juggle the ball and lose it, but in
the second half the hacks seemed bet-
ter able to hold the ball and launched
an, otfensive which Cornell seemed
powerless to check, \

Captain Markley repeatedly thrilled
the crowd by his clever line plunging
and good defensive work This is the
first time this year that he has shown
anything like his old time speed and
local football devotees expressed them-
selves as highly pleased with. his per—
formance. Truekenmiiler played a
good game at half until an injured
leg forced him to leave the game. He
was replaced by Walters who, in spite
of a lame leg, madesoine substantial
gains through the Cornell line. Erint-
nail, playing his ﬁrst varsity game,

' did very consistent work at the guard
uosition.

Fearing was substituted for MeLain'
in the third quarter and his clever
broken ﬁeld running helped much in

, i
paving the way for the two Ploneef

touchdowns which were made shortly
after his entrance in the game.
Line Plays Good Game.

As usual the line acquitted itself in
ﬁne shape. At times the Methodists
broke through for long gains but
whenever their goal was threatened
the Pioneer line held impregnahly
against the Purple and White offense.
Grinnell linesmen, also, seemed able
to tear holes through the Cornell line

The work of Datesman and Richards
at the end positions was one of the
outstanding features of the game. Both
men were on the job every mlnutd of
the game proving equally capable on
both offense and defense.‘ Richards
frequently checked runs around his
and by running the play out of bounds
before it could gun, while Duemun
repeatedly broke up interference and
got the runners before he could get
by the line of scrimmage.

McLain kicked off to Cornell at the
first whistle. Cornell punted on the
ﬁrst play, evidently desiring to take
advantage of the strong north wind
which favored them. Grinnell then
started out on what looked to be a
certain touchdown but a fumble halted
their advance. Cornell played safe and
kicked whenever they got the boil,
Finally this style of play brought them
within striking distance of the Grin—
nell goal but here the Pioneer line
held and the visitors tried a place
kick from the 30-yard line. The kick
was short and ,ended the only chance

of scoring which Cornell hail through-'

out the game.
Second Quarter.

In the second quarter Miller inter-
cepted a Cornell pass but the team
could not settle down enough to make
consistent gains. During the latter
part of the quarter McLain began a
punting dual which, had it been he-
gun sooner, would probably have put
the Pioneers in at stltlon to score
but the final whistle of the half found
the ball in central territory with
neither side seriously threatening the
other. Score: Grinnell 0, Cornell 0.
