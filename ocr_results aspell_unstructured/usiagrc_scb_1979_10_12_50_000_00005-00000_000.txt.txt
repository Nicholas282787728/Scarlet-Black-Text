An artsy eating alternative

by ion Hetrell

This week marked the opening of
the newest eating establishment on
campus. The brainchild of Dave Mt:-
Coiinell and Jenny Erickson, the
Forum Gallery Salad and Deli Bar
opened this past Monday as an alter-
native to the Forum Grill and
downtown luncheon places

The idea {or the Forum Gallery
Salad and Dell Bar originated as a
way to make better use or the Forum
PDRS. In the past, a lunch was served
to groups and committees who reserv~
ed the tables. A full meal was uttered
at a set price and it was found that
people often were served more than
they wanted and felt it wasn't worth
the money, McConnell thought that a
program was needed which would be
inexpensive and appealing to the
diner, and yet economical enough [or
the establishment to break even. This
“a la carte" plan holds promise
because it allows more flexibility in
budgets and amounts, and because the
equipment and employees are already
in commission trom the previous pro
gram.
