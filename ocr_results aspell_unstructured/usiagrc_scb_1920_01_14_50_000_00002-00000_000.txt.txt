Do You Think

A College Is All Ethical-
ttlillill Factory.

l‘llo Student Council Should

ll» Responsible to the
Faculty. i

The problem or the scope or student
sell sovornrrient is a difiicult one to
solve and one which is more often mis-
understood than comprehended

The basis for much criticism of slur
dent government is the ialse assumpr
tion that its rights, privileges and

duties should cor-respond to those
' which are associated with the gen—

eral conception or self government in
state and nntlour

There are few if any points of Sims
ilarity between the government of the
state of Iowa and the student self
government of Grinnell College.

The state government, theoretically
at least, represents ALL of the peo—
ple of the state. Student government
represents all or the students but the
students are only one part a! the ac-
tive college group. '

The body politic or a college con-
sists roughly of the faculty, the 1dr
ministration and the students No

government which docs not include
each of these groups can possibly be»
a representative government.

But from the very nature of a col»
loge it rs possible to bind these three
elements together to form an institu-
tional government. The, reason is
that a college is not a political entity.
It is more comparable to a factory
than a democracy.

Analyzing the college then. as the
educational factory which it is easel-iv
tially, we ﬁnd ideiitrcal groups ins

volved. In one case We have the face
my owner's and management, in the
other there are trustees and adminis-
tration.' Just as the manuiacturer em—
ploys workers to make the product
which he is placing on the market
so a college must have professors to
produce the higher education which
it offers to the public.

The next step is to point out that
the students are to the college what
the ultimate consumer is to the fac-
tory. It then follows that in the re-
lation between administration and the
students it will be the main concern
of the administration to ﬁnd out what
the students most desire and furnish
these things as far as it is possible.

There apparently no sound
reason why a student representative
body should approach the administra-
tion through the faculty.

In reorganizing the student self govA
ernment of Grinnell it is our opinion
that the student council or whatever
it may be called, should advise the
administration on matters directly
concerning the students in the same
way that the laculty is an advisory
body in regard to matters of curricu-

is

him.

However the place or the students
in the educational factory is not so
easily catalogued. The situation is
complicated by the fact that there are
others vitally interested ’in the matter-
h ads the students. The largest class.
perhaps, is that made up of the par-
ents who, in most cases, are paying
the hills. Then there are the alumni
who have been consumers in the past
and still retain a real interest in thc
concern. They may be compared to
sales agents in the hcld.

——6—
Several conclusions can be drawn

from this analogy. First, that the aide

ministration and not the inciilty

the group which is diiectly i-espiin

ihlc lor the “113' in which the Cnllcgcl

ally roots with the administration.
True, the lilcult} is iocogni ed as l)C-‘,
lug particularly well qiidliiled to [4110
charge in certain allairs or the col-
lcgc which do not (rill within the scope
of their pedagogical dutics. But even
in these things the adiiiinistrlitioii still
remains supreme. When rill is said
the Izioiiliy acts iiieroly iii ‘ALl advisory
capacity.

In the second place it is plain that

the students CAN NOT govern the

government he subordinate to the col
lege administration

0n the other hand it is equally plain
that the college managers are very
mlxiuus to please their students as tar

tion are not lujmed.
Lion are not injures.

which it that the main function ot‘
a student goiorurug body is to act
as an official body which can placel
before the administration [he wi, es
or the students whom they r-cpr-escntl

This places the student council in.
exactly the same relation to the ad-l
ministration as that existing between,
the taculty and the administration. '

If Uncle Rumus didn't tell this story
about Bl'e'l‘ Rabbit, he should have,

It seems that a certain wealthy
nienrber of the Rabbit Clan uttered a
large prize tor the rabbit who could
lump the Iarthest. As the time came
around tor the big match Ble’l‘ Rahr
bit quietly let it be known among
each of the other possible contenders
that all the rest were training and
practicing to the limit in order to win
the prize. To each he reported the
fabulous distances that the others had
attained. Consequently on the day
of the match the only one to enter was
Bre‘r Rabbit, Disoouragement had
dcfoatde the others.

This year as always the sterner-
prize of my dollars is being ottered
for a piece of original literary work.
If there are any Bre'i- Rabbits around,
including the one born of one‘s own
fancy, call their blult. You have just
as much chance as the next man and
it is nobody: prize until the decision
is made.

The fact that the prize this year is
given tor a campus song doubles the
reward. To the money prize will he
added the' knowledge that something
which will he of‘permanent value to
the college has been accomplished,

Competition for the steiner prize
'should never be keener than this year.

Crinnell is the real seat of classic

From Gllnnell then, it is quite natural
that the literary views of Iowa, who

originate.

But although the views may be here
in this practical world things do not
run on sentiment. Business is neces—
