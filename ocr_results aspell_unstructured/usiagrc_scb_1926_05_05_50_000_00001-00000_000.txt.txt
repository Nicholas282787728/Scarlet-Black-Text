“Gyrano De Bargain" Is
Most Amhillnus littering

The presentation of Rostand's "Cy<
rano de Bergerac” as the senior play.
June 5, will mark a definite advance,
in both standard of production and
play, over any production offered to
returning alumni and friends of the
college in previous yars.

Ros‘tand's heroic comedy, since its
first presentation in Paris has been
ranked as one of the masterpieces of
romantic drama. Such actors as
Cooueiin. Mansfield and Hampden
have been seen in the title role, Two
generations of theaterrgoe - have
been thrilled by the exquisite poetry
of the play and old and young alike
have rejoiced in the humor, the del—
icacy and charm with which the Senlk
historical characters have been sketr
ched.

Every resource of Griuuell dramatic
organizations will be used to make
"Cyrano" a success. The actors have
been chosen from the Dramatic club
and noon the college at large. The
production is in charge of Mr. Wil»
ham Angus and members of the E»
perimental theatre. The actors will
be directed by Arthur Eaguy-Cote.

”Cyrano de Bergerac" is the most
ambitious offering ever presented by
the students of the college as a corn-
mencement play. The cast includes
thirty characters. Five scenes re-
quiring the use of the full stage will
alter a variety of pictorial achiever
ments. Lighting and costumes will
be unusual.

Rehearsals under Mr, Faguy-Cote
began last evening and will continue
for the next five weeks,

QUAD ATHLETICS
GET UNDER WAY

lgllly Gi Sign U]? For rltlvlulcoil
'l'ulllli ; Forty For Baseball.

Spring sports for women are now
well under way, and at the close of
the second week of activity there is
promise of an unusually successful
outdoor season. The sports are under-
the supervision of Miss Harriet [cog-
lin, who says that the Work is pro-
gressing rapidly and that keen inter.
est is being shown by those taking
part.

Competition For Title

Approximately eighty girls have
signed up for advanced tennis, an un—
usually large enrollment for that
sport. The championship singles
tournament is now in full swing and
the first round will be completed to-
day. The excellence or the material
among the entries makes the compo-
tition unusually close among the twene
ty-seven contenders for the tltle. In
the beginning tennis classes there is
an enrollment of about twenty.

Over forty girls have taken up base-
ball, which has necessitated a divis-
ion into two baseball classes. rre-
liminary workouts have been in pro.
gross during the past two weeks, and
a division into teams will be made in
the near future. A series of games
will then be played off to determine
the champions.

Train For Track

The track squad of about twenty
girls is working out every afternoon
and is showing lively interest in thls
sport. The squad is doing real work
and training rules are being strictly
observed. A dis ,ion into three
smaller sounds ‘in charge of squad
leaders has been made, and each squad
is working successively at the hurdles,
standing and rurnriug broad jump,
high jump, javeliu and discus throw,
and sprinting. Much good material
has made its appearance, so that cons
Iiuuthion of the present bard train~
his will assure a good track meet
with sharp competition later in the
spring.

SLIVER CUPS FOR
PIONEER PARADE

As an inducement to increase the
number or floats in the Pioneer Day
parade, to be held at 10 o’clock, the
morning of May 22, the senate is of-
fering three. handsome silver loving
cups as prizes.

Every organization, building, and
cottage is expected to turn out a
float in an attempt to win one of these
cups. One of the silver cups will go
to the best float the dormitories place
in the parade; a second will go to the
best cottage float; and the third will
be presented to the organization which
enters the most attractive or unusual
float. Every organization expecting
to par 'cipate in the gala event is
asked to turn in its name to Harry
Lanrbly in order that the committee
may know the extent ol the parade bee
forehand.

The parade is but one of the events
which will have a part in making this
second annual rionccr Day even more
successful than that of last year.

Dorothy Westiall, '23. who has been
confined to the Community hospital
for several weeks, was taken to her
home at Mason City Monday.

White Athletes.

t Saturday afternoon, Grinnell
and Drake wi resume hostrlitres.
when thc track athletes of the two
schools clash in their annual dual
meet on Ward lield. During the past
few years it has been customary for
ltllc Pioneers to casily down their old
l'ivztls on the cinder path. This year,
advance dope and the performances of
the Blue and White men in their dual
wrtb Ames last Saturday would indi»
cate that the Pioneers are doomed for
deleut next Saturday.

The Bulldogs will bring a galaxy of
track and field stars that are able to
compete with the best in the middle
west. The Blue and White institution
has a well balanced team and should
be able to score in every event.

Hate I‘ust Sprinters

In the dashes the Bulldogs will have
Dustin, Fry, and Tolies who are all
capable of covering the century in 10
flat time and we furlong under 23
seconds. Simpson, former Perry High
school star, and Pcnquite have been
running the hurdles in fast time all
season and will undoubtedly take the
event here. Simpson is also a good
high jumper. Van Lanningham has
been consistently running the half
mile around 1:53 which is fast enough
to place in almost any meet.

The Bulldogs are weak in the mile
run and did not place a man in this
event in the Ames dual. In the two
mile. Wahl should ’efisily have things
his way. Dolby ln the pole vault has
cleared 12 feet 9 inches, and in the
high jump Enlnk and Carle can easily
clear the bar at 6 feet. Boettger, who
won the shot at the Texas Relays may
be able to push Rinelol't and Meeter
in the shot and discus.
