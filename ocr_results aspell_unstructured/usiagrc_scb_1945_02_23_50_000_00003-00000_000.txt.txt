Con‘lmon Man, Dumbar+on
Oaks,-Jews, Europe Ci’red

Dr. Carl J. Friedrich of Harvard university Monday morn-
ing opened a series of five International Relations lectures
in Herrick chapel with an expressed belief in the potell»
tiality of a newer and more sophisticated concept of the
“common man.” Dr. Friedrich declared that there seems
to be widespread failure to appreciate the fact that what
we are confronted with today is not a problem of convert-
ing the peoples of the world into Americans, but, rather,
being Americans and getting along with the peoples of the

world.

That Americans must face the
realities of the situation in re-
gard to peace was the underly-
ing theme of the introductory lece
ture.

it Will be impossible to establish
relations with her after victory.
Changes in government do not
occur at the pinnacle of victory."

Dr. Friedrich made it clear
that the fundamental thing is not
to be inflamed against Russia,
but to understand her as she is.

“I'm personally convinced," he
declared, “that beyond the pres-
ent organization of the soviet
Union there lies a democratic
concept."

Dumbai-ton Oaks

At his second lecture entitled
“Dumbarton Daksiwhat It Is
and What It is Not,” Dr. Fried-
rich declared that a substantial
public opinion behind the more
drastic proposals than Dumbar-
tcn oaks might result in "a firm-
er stand” by United states delev
‘gates at the April 25 conference
in San Francisco,

Because a strong world orga-
nization will tend to have two
dominant powers, which he be-
lieves will be the U. s. and the
U. s, s. a, the proposed world

,curity council."

Jewish Problem

The Jewish problem in Europe
is inseparably related to the idea
of international organization and
the new belief in the common
man, according to Dr. Carl Fried~
rich in his third lectur , entitled
“Palestine and Peace—The Jew-
isli problem in Europe.” Dr. Fried-
rich believes that the key to this
problem lies in the solution of
'thc question of a Jersh nation-
al home in Palestine.

In this discussion, the speaker
expressed the opinion that the
Jews deserved to be allowed to
establish a national home in Pal-
estine, because they, more than
harry other people. have born the
brunt of Nazi oppression and per.
secution. This solution would al-
so be in keeping with our demo-
cratic idea that a person should
be allowed to go where he wants
to and do as he pleases. “The
Jews themselves desire this so-
lution,” added Dr. Friedrich.

He expressed the belief that
the only lasting solution to this

The capacity of Palestine to
support a large population has
increased so much since 1919
that Dr. Friedrich predicts that
any immigration could be easily
absorbed.

European Problems

Americans are drifting back to
the “wash our hands of the whole
affair” attitude with regards to
the problems of the future of
Europe, said Dr. Friedrich in his
fourth lecture Wednesday night
on “The Problems of Europe.”

“The problem of the future of
Europe is the problem of the
meaning of the war," he said.
Citing the first problem as the
attitude of universal frustration
and bitterness on the continent,
Dr, Friedrich went on to consid-
er ltaly, France, and Poland as
specific examples of a general
social turnover.

The British refusal and rejec»
tion of Count Sforza as foreign
minister is the highlight of the
whole ltalian hodgepodge, polit.
ically speaking, which has re-
sulted from the failure to pro-
vide someone able to cope with
the ltalian political problems. The
Fascist movement has aiisen
again in ltaly; there is a food
shortage and flagrant inflation,
And it is this Italian problem
which foreshadows the problems
of the whole of Europe.

Discussing Greece, the speaker
pointed out that while the Brit.
ish made the wrong decision
about the government for this
Balkan country, the United
states had made no decision at
all. Here again the allies are
confronted by inflationary and
social problems.

The Polish situation, said Dr.
Friedrich, is an example of one
of the primary social problems.

Friedrich said.

‘He added that the Dumbarton

barriers could be destroyed and
any Jews who wished to would
be free to migrate there.

Must Expect Social Turnover

Emphasizing the importance of
‘lhe hcart of his speech a the
idea that we must expect thisl
,social, political, and' economic
turnover a the speaker went on
to demonstrate that the people
of Europe are being influenced
in their swing to Russia, by sev-
eral simple facts. In the first
lplace, these people see the Rus-
sians as the ones who defeated
lHitler and the Nazis. Then, they
recall the pre—n-ai- days when the
socialists said the parliamentary,
system and action would work,
and when the communists sup _
portcd revolution. They reinem
bar this and also recall that with

ance; that we should accopt'that
fact; and that stalin has made
no other effort than to cushion
the impact of these coming rev»
olutions and has not actively sup-
ported them.\

German Problem

with a discussion of “The Probe
lem of Germany,” Dr. Carl Fried
ricli brought to a close his series
of five lectures,

One of the first problems
considered is that of the German
underground. Although many
Germans themselves died in the
early struggle against Hitler,
are there some left who Will sup-
port us, or have they all been
eliminated? No German under»
ground has existed since 1939
similar to the French or Dutch
underground, 'The German or-
ganization was destroyed. but re—
sistance to the Nazi regime re-
mains in isolated groups "Many
Germans regard Hitler's regime
as a form of foreign rule . . . but
they will not overthrow him be-
cause they cannot.”

Dr. Friedrich emphasized the
lack of American help and inter
motion which reaches the German
people. Their principal contact
with the outside world comes
through communistic sources in
Russia.

Allied psychological warfare
against Germany is beginning to
show results. German morale has
been lowered lately, and there
are signs of the same pacifism
born of despair as was found in
ltaly.

Lutheran traditions have tend-
ed to make the German people
introverts, who have excelled in
philosophy and music but failed
in a field such as government

In 1933 Nazi support came
from three principal sourcesethe
Junkers, the middle class group,
and the peasants. The nationals

tion, but they very quickly re-
alized their mistake. Opppsition
to Hitler came from the workers,
who were mostly social democrats
and communists, and the Catho-
lics. In 1939 at the outbreak of
,the war, the situation was prac-
tically the same, Fifty per cent
of the population stood behind
the Nazis, and the other fifty
.per cent were against them. How-
ever, only a small percentage of
each group were active in their
support or opposition.

J Dr. Friedrich concluded his last
lecture by stressing the import-
ance of not allowing ourselves to
be drawn by illeadvisad counselors
|into betraying the precious heri-
ltage which makes us Americans.
