Cluster staff
were all new

Erickson, cant. from p. I

Several people noted that everyone
was new in Jamaland, both the student
staff and the RLC. “Chuck was a first
year RLC," said Cleveland First SA Su—
san Hildebrand ’08. “We were all first
year student staff, so nobody was pretty
sure of how the RLCrstudent staff re,
lationship was supposed to look."

Jay Bacz’07, another Jamaland stu-
dent Staff member, expressed his con»
cerns about Erickson to the Human
Resources investigation. He recalled
having issues with Erickson, because
ofwhat he said was Erickson‘s problem
with drawing lines and establishing
studentrstaff relationships.

Hildebrand agreed. “I think there
were times when he pushed the bound-
aries ofwhat was appropriate, and what
were appropriate topics of conversae
tion," she said.

Where some saw boundary issues,
SarahThomas ’08 saw a sense ofhumor.
“He sparks a sense ofhumor that allows
students to maintain some perspective
in the disproportionately stressful envi-
ronment of Grinncll,”she said.

Thomas wrote a letter to adminiSr
tration on April 13 in which she ex
pressed her concerns about Erickson’s
dcpatture.Thomas is on student staff in
Loosehead and knew Erickson through
the Stonewall Resource Center. “Chuck
is very considerate of his students and
takes the time to hear them out and lis»
ten to underlying complaints and cone
cerns,"Thomas wrote.

The entire RLC body is helping
run Jamaland until the year is over.

Barber receives Fulbright

Heat and drought impede agricul»
ture in subrSaharan Africa. Wes Barber
'06 will be spending next year trying to
change that.

Barber, a Biology major from St.
Louis, recently received a fellowship
from the Fulbright Program, which
provides educational grants to students
wishing to study overseas The pro»
gram, which was founded by senator
J. William Fulbright and is funded by
both the U.S. government and other
nations, has since 1948 given grants to
over 250,000 individuals. This year, the
Fulbright program gave eight grants for
work in South Africa out of about 100
applicants.

This year John Snyder ’,05 Trir
cia Hadley 03, Eva Constantaras ’,06
ElenaYesner co and James Taggatt on
have been awarded Fulbright Fellow»
shipsTaggcrt's, recently awarded, is to
teach English in South Korea. Students
interested in learn-
ing about Fulbright
Fellowships can
attend-an informa-
tional meeting this
Thursday, May 4 in
ARI—I 305.

Barber will
work with Jennifer
Thomson, a profes-
sor at the University of Cape Town in
South Africa. He discovered her web
site two years ago and was intrigued
enough to contact her directly. Barber
will be studying ways to genetically
engineer droughtrresistant corn that
would grow more easily in the inhosr
pitable conditions ofsubrSaharan Afr
rica. Speciﬁcally he will investigate the
possibility of transferring traits from
the South African “resurrection plants,"
which can regeneiate after wrlting in
bad conditions.

Barber was ﬁrst intrigued about

Africa when he read Joseph Conrad's
HeartafD/lrknerr his junior year ofhigh
school, and has wanted to work there
ever since.

Kathy Jacobson, Biology, is Barber's
advisor and challenged him to combine
his desire to travel with his research in-
terests. He also received similar advice
from his advisor at his summer lntetnr
ship at the New York
State Department of
Health. "You only
get to be young once
and you try to travel
when you're young,“
Barber said.

Aside from mo-
lecular biology, Barr
ber’s interests include
golf and baseball. He is a big fan of the
St. Louis Cardinals.

After graduating, Barber plans to
spend this summer studying the breed
ing of corn plants in Princeton, Illinois.
He leaves for south Africa in February
and plans to stay for ten months, If at
the end of his project he decides not to
stay in Africa, he then hopes to pursue
a PILD, in Plant Science.

“I'm very excited," said Barber, “It’s
hopefully the start to a career that takes
me all over the world,"

Predicting class of ’10

av EMILIA GARVEV

As they streamed across campus, red
tote bags and Grinnell folders in hand,
prospective students tried to get a sense
of what it would be like to go to col-
lege at Grinnell.They tried out campus
bikes on what was, for them, uncharted
terrain. One tried to elicit concern for
his squeaky back wheel. At the student
organization fair, prospies with parents
in tow pointed to the BEiS, inquiring if
it was the main campus newspaper.

Admitted students have until May
1 to make a college choice, and many
of them have spent the past month
visiting potential colleges to compare
classes, campus life and general ambi-
ance. Dean of Admission Jim Sumner
tried to predict the makeup of the class
of2010 as accurately as possible,but as
Admissionchangesrecruitmentpolicies
and acceptance practices, the makeup
of each class remains guesswork.

This year, recruitment technicuqes
underwent a few small changes. “In
August there are students who really
want to talk about going college and
don't have anyone to talk about it with
because they’re not back in school yet,”
said Sumner. “We had group programs
and did interviews for some of these
students."Thcy held these programs in
Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, BoSr
ton and Washington no.

The Admission office has also inv
creased outrcach to students of color
and other underrepresented popula-
tions through mailings, highrschool
visits and by bringing students directly
to campus. “We do the Diversity Lead-
ers program," said Sumncl‘. “we bring
students in the fall,and then bring back
the admitted students in April.”

The college is looking to do mole

programs like Posse, which bring in
promising inner—city students, but they
also want to encourage a more racially
diverse student body outside of sponr
sored programs. The class of 2009 re—
ﬂects this effort. “The class of 2009 is
the most ethnically diverse class we've
had," said Sumner. “Less than 25 per
cent of this group were Posse smdents.
They are important, but just one part.”
In 2001, at the request of the trust»
ees, Admission began effort to attract
more afﬂuent students. Admission
sends extra mailings to students who
live in prosperous zip codes. Although
this move has encouraged more amu-
ent students to apply, said Sumner, the
college has not seen an increase afﬂuent
students attending. “If you’re a tnistee,
you might be disappointed with this,"
said Sumner, “but if you're a student
who wants it to remain the egalitarian
place it's been, you might be happy."
The ﬁrst year without need-blind
admission for international students.
this year’s international admission rate
dropped by half, from 250 last year to
122 this year. The incoming class is ex-
pected to include 40 to 50 international
students. A “needrsensitlvc” policy for
international applicants announced in

2005 toolt other for this crop ofnppll—

cams and accounts. In the past, Grinnell
made needrblind decisions for Interna—
lionitl applicants, but did not promise
to meet their full financial need. “What
was happening was that we were having
to say to them that they were accepted
but that they were denied admission for
ﬁnancial reasons," said Sumner. “We
could never meet their full ﬁnancial
need."
