A rum TALE

A letter from a prominent mining
engineer to President Main speaks of
Grinnell as "one of the few remain—
ing colleges ol.’ the country} Inves-
tlgnlion will prove that he was cor-
rect in his statement. There are verY
few colleges remaining in the United
states for, as in so many other things,
the majority have caught the fever
of "keeping up with the dances."

Grlnnell has thus far been strong
enough to resist the prevailing fasha
ion, to go against the. current of pop-
ular practice, and to retain her stand.
ing as one of the greatest colleges in
the country. And this despite pressure
from both within and WithuuL The
majority or us are glad that Gi'inuell
is a college, that Grlnnell is distinc-
tive, that Grinnell dues maintain the
high educational standards on which
her reputation was founded and is he»
in; retained. That is one a! the great
reasons Why We are here~because

Grinnell, as a college, is the type of
‘ institution that we want to claim for

our alma mater.

But if We are to keep the College on
her present high plane, we must also
maintain the traditions and the prac—

,tices that are a part of the school.
Chief among these is voluntary chap<
e1.

To have a voluntary chhpel service
in a college or university is a novelty
in the present day-educational world,
when required subjects are the rule
and a deﬁnite line of action is mapped
out for the average student. That a
Voluntary chapel service has been 1' -
tained here in view of the apathy fre-
quently exhibited by the students, is

a miracle. It has been retained sim—
ply because a disunctivo feature such
as this dies hard, because the Admin-
istration has faith in the student budY
and in its ﬁnal reaction to the trust
reposed in it, and to the opportuni-

ties oftercd. ,

It is up to us to justify this faith and
the turnout Friday rooming was en-
couraglng. Of course it may he argu-
ed that the service is a Waste of time
and that the speakers give you noth—
ing. Owaslunally this is true, Again,
it may he claimed by the faculty that
the students fail to show suiticicnt
interest 1.0 encourage the preparation
of a good talk, and this tOO is fre-
quently the case. However the en—
tire responsibility can not be laid on
either students or iaculty. but it must
be charged to both.

We can get something out of the
chapel hour, even if the speaker is
rotten, by concentrating on something
else, or in introspectionipruvlded the
service is held in Herrick Chapel Ilntl
not in Alumni Recitation Hall.

“THE ORACLE

In his chapel speech Thursday

morning, President Main opened up a

subject that has long been under dlSr
cussloil in Grliincll, that or the Ol-
acle. Taliiug as a general thesis the
phrase, “oracles past and present

he give something of the history of

9..

(lie Greek organization, its inilucuce
on etlllcllnll, and the part that it play»
ed in Greek life. “The Greek Oracle,"
he said, “was one or the most sig—
niﬁcant events in tlic lilstoly of the
world. it had a vast inﬂuence and by
its ambiguous answers put the respoilr
sibilily tor action on the individual.
This neCeSSltated thinking, and rarer
ed each man to fight his problems out
and to determine them in his own
soul."

Applying the subject to the present,
Pr ~idcnt Main declared that at body
that did not ﬁght in the open but lhat
halcd one forth to be the subject of an
attack with a bar- l stave, at midnight,
or shot at moonrise at ten o'clock, was
against the traditions of Grinnoll and
against the principles of our American
organization.
with this light on the subject, it
seems desirable that the discussion
be carried somewhat farther, inaase
much as the immediate cause of the
present situation was an article that
appeared the SCARLET AND
BLACK some low weelrs ago.

The SCARLET AND BLACK be-
lleves that there should be no curtail-

may be said for the

which is under consideration, With

the present system of nourcoutl'ul of
theolasses, some organization is near

who violate the traditions of the col:
lege. Fundamentally, that should be

the purpose of any group such as the

oracle and as long as it handles its

air manner and is all

so

active inﬂuence in college affairs,
long should it be encouraged. If it is
guilty of unfair tactics, degenerates
into a group for the payment of per-
sonal grudges, then it should be sup-

ed by something that will ful-

Returning to the analogy, the Greolr
Oracle was a powerful inﬂuence in
olden times and it threw the burden
of decision on the individual. Furl—
damcntally, however, its value was
due to the mystery that surrounded
it and that necessitated individual de-
cisions. It was an instrument of the
Greek religious sects and was to lur—
thor tllC liest interests of those groups
in Greece. In the same manner, the
Grinnell Oracle is supposed to further
the best interests or Grinnell College,
And when the barrage of gossip and
hysteria has been cleared away, it
seems that it is doing it as no other
existing group could. Until the cause
tor it is removed, or we become a
model student body, it should continue
to function, acting as a governor on
the inch or the college and as a re
straining hand on those few who mer-

What Do You Think?

Editor Scarlet and Black:
When the Iowa Band came out West

to found it college, they had foremost’
in their minds high and lofty ldentlsI

to which they wished to give expres-
sion in the inundation or a Liberal
Arts College. And we are proud [0'
say that thru seventy-ﬁve years of
existence this college has stood as a
sponsor for the ideals which are the
highest and best in men and women.
Twelve years ago this college still
struggling along on its idealistic basis
but growing little in the material sense
of the word, was put into nod execu—
tlvs hands. Ever since that date.
Grinuell College has grown and grown
until we now have one of the three
outstanding schools in the State of
Iowa, but it was a distinctive charac-
ter, and that is, it is still what it was
originally planned that it should be,
a Liberal Arts College, But, what a
struggle that one distinctive mark is
engaged in to insure its existence! I
am almost tempted to say that it is
ﬁghting the battle single-handed, and
by that remark I mean to say that
President Main is the only person on
the faculty of whom I have any know-
ledge who is openly trying against all
odds to keep high and lofty the ideals
for which a Liberal Arts College such
as Grinnell College stands. It appears
to me thathe alone is lined up against
both the faculty and the Trustees of
the college, and on that one issue.
This is not an attempt to euloglze our
President, though I believe no man
is more worthy of one than he, hilt it
is an out and out statement to the
eifect that we will ﬁght to the last
ditch with the President on this issue,
as against the faculty and Trustees.
Here is the point. Presldeut Main
believes in a Liberal Arts College, if
we may believe what he has said on
numerous occasions on that subject,
and he believes in Grinnell as the per-
soniﬁcation of the ideals growing out
of a Liberal Arts College. We all know
that he has had opportunities to head
other larger institutions at a morn
attractive salary than he at present
receives but he has refused them all
o nly because of his loyalty to Grinnell
and her traditional ideals. What do
we have on the other side? A group
or discipline loving. machine-like edu-
cators, who are determined that if
they can develop a machine in which
every cog is an ”A" student, the King-
dom of Heaven will be at hand, This
is not mere hearsay, and those of you
who heard a certain member of the
English Department on Monday of
this week will hear me out on this
point. These sarcalled teachers don‘t
belong in a Liberal Arts College
where the closest sort of communica-
tion between student and teacher is
dcsired, but they belong in a Univer-
sity where their ideal conception of a
school may he found, an institution
which is run by the state to satlsfy
the educational needs of the people of
the state, only, and not to instill into
the minds and hearts of the students
the ideals, for which a school like
Grinnell stands. The teachers do not
care to know the students. They are

there to pound so much knowledge
into them and at the end of each month
they draw their pay for their labors,
and labors they are, for they are al-
ways seeking for more "red tape."
President Main is for the students
in almost everything they undermke.
He at least respects the good judg-
ment of the student body and is \vll—
ling to meet them halfway in most of
their enterprises. An example of his
fitth in our judgment is the fact that
chapel. attendance is optional in Grin»
hell, the responsibl ty falling altar
gather upon the individual. The Ett-
tendance st chapel ls not the best, but
You may be sure that those Who are
there are sincere ln coming. I dare

say that if the Curriculum Cnmmittee‘

had the problem of chapel attendance
in their hands, We would be forced to
go to chapel next Monday and not
because we had any voice in tho inat-
ter, either. But, I would be reluctant
in saying that the student judgment
is always right. Far from it, for
‘many are the occasions when Presl-
dent Main has taken the opportunity-
to roast us for our actions. But, be~
cause we have faith in him, and he in
us, we respect him for it the more.
In fact, I thing a person would be
forced to look far and wide on this

pull for "Prexy."
why doesnt’ the faculty malts up

dent activities il you do persist in

you say you aren't interested in nth»
letics to that extent. Alright. why
dont' you tslre a little interest in the
Y. M. C. AK! Here’s your chance to
show your colon. in making out a
report the other day a student was
fumed to admit the fact that there was
but one active member in the Y. from
'the body faculty. One man on the
whole faculty of men who take an
‘lnterest in the things which are most
essential for every young man to

lrnow. A line record, is it not?
While on the subject of religion, 1
might say that if more oi the facuulty
talirs jn chapel were devoted to relic-
ion, as they ought by right to be, ra—
ther than to each professor's pet hobby,

the students would be better off,‘

President Main is the only chapel
speaker who ever gives us any real
religion to meditate over, and that is
one reason why we like him.

It may surprise you to know that 1
have not had a “raw deal" handed to
me which caused the writlng of this
article. 1 have merely had the same
sort of mechanical training that ulght

Weren’t for the ideals, dreams, and
actual accomplishments of our Presl-
dent Main, I should hate to think of
the place our school would occupy
among real schools.

A crisis is approachlng when the
two forces as spoken of are going to
clash, and one at the other must.
back down. One need only go to Chl—

ago Hall or enter the business olflce
to observe the change from recent
years. It is common talk on the
campus and in Grinnell that. some-
thing is wrong. I trust it is not
neecssary for me to repeat the name
of the force I am backing and in which
I alive implicit faith.
