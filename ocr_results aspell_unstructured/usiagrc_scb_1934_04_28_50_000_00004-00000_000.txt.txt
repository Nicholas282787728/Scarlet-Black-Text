Only three of the water polo teams
will attempt to win the trophy if
there is no playoff, unless the Gates
leaders change their minds and de~
cide to take a chance with the others.
“We‘d rather give the trophy away
than win it by chance after already

to risk a second tournament." is the
Gates attitude.

Gates claimed that it had won the
first tournament. even though its
team protested a referee's decision by
leaving the pool before time was calls
ed in the deciding game with Rawson.
The intramural hoard awarded the
game to Rawson over a Gates pro—
test.

The other claimants to the title

say that they do not wish to replay-

the tournament because of lateness
of the season, lack of time due to
other activities, and the prevalence
of head colds and sinus trouble after
every game.

Tom Gordon. veteran miler, may be
in the best condition of the season
today at the Drake relays in spite of
his absence from the squad during
the previous week. according to
Coach Duke, “The rest. far from
harming him. has probably done him
good.” Duke asserted. Gordon has
been nursing a sore leg all season.

The annual Grinnell Interscholastic
track meet to be held here next
Saturday seems to be turning into a
second state high school meet. Six-
teen high schools entered last year.
and over 200 men participated. This
year. with 250 schools specifically
invited to enter and every school in
the state eligible to enter men. the
number of athletes who will invade
Ward field appears to be without lim-
it. Many of the invited teams will
not enter, however. and some of the
other schools will probably not send
full squads.

Authorities at Georgia Tech have
given their implicd approval of the
United States' passport regulations.
They have ordered that each athletic
passbcok must have the owner's pic-
ture on the cover.

that movies are potentially the best
educational force in the country to-
day. We don‘t know whether to
stress that word. "potentially, or to
put a broad interpretation on “edu-
