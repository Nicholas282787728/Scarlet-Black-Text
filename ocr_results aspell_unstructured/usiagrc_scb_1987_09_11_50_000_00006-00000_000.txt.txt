Renovations and V
decorations

are not “appropriate”

To the Editor:

I wonder, who on earth makes
renovation and decoration deci-
sions for college buildin s'? 1
ask this hccause I recsuty saw
what was perpetrated in the
lobby/foyer of “Harry Hopkins
House.” This space is the ut
timate expression of the word
“chi-chi." All that owder blue,
all that turn-orthe-ceutury,
Pseudo English re roduction fnrr
niturs, and that ogviously mega-
ex ensive Frenchiﬁed chandelier
(wiich isn‘t even very ﬁnely
made}. All or the details are
more suitable tor the average
suburban house or the Grinnell
House ty e, than for a house
that is asicaily no ditrerent
ironi thousands or lowa farms
houses.

This house continues anrl dee —
ens the mistakes that were "In e
with Mears Hall. There we had
the chance to do something re-
ally elegant and in kec ing with
the stature or the col ego. the
stead, the result was merely ser-
viceable. i hear so many :0»
pie who call it “posh," We 1, it
may be more posh than what
they have at, say “Okefenokee
College,“ bilt is that really our
standard of comparison?

in future, when the college do
rides to lart»up a building (and
not simply rip everythiu out),
why don‘t the Powers Tiat Be
consider the qualities of “suit
ability“ and "appropriateness,"
let alone “good taste?"

Senior muses over’his

G

By Marc nnss

Here it is; I am ﬁnally a se-
nior. Somehow i felt that at
this point I would be more cits
cited, utter all a I AM A SE-
NIOR!! Nopc, that didn‘t do
it. In cight months barring the
possible tragedy o not acquir—
ing twelve crcditsor flunkin a
class in my major, I will grac u-
ate. l don t have nny fear of the
rcal world at this point. Whv
should I? I mean therc is still
graduate school, isn‘t there? My
standing as a senior does, how-
ever, make me feel as in aru in
a good position to put forward
some of the ideas that have becn
accumulated over thc last thrcc
years.

Each year we, meaning those
or us who either read the s and
B or know someone who docs,
get to [tear just how smart the
new ireshmeu class is. This year
is no exce tion, Grinnell, or so
I‘m told, has its most promis
ing new class or all time. Thcv
all managed to get into Griuncll
l'm impressed, after all Grinnell
College is “one of the to tell
outstanding liberal-arts co logos
in the US." (as declared some
two years a o by tile U.S. News
and World eport). Quite lloil~
estly their SAT and ACT rcsults
do not impress me, The na-
tional average on these two test
are both on the rise. Ifthc Grins
rtell average were to have taken a
nose dive then I would have bccn
rorccd to transrcr to Careltou or
Oberlin Salso on that now tamed
toprteii ist, and both ranked
higher)! Besides, my scores on
both tests are still higher than
the Freshman average. Further
more, if the freshman class is

ctting smarter every year, why
3o tltey need signs to tell the dit
terence between the Forum and
Steiner Hall?

Oh, that brings me to another
interesting topic: the so caltcd
”tortillstoncs". Unlike most [of
my senior eers, I don't dis—
like them. hey are stream-lino
in appearance, and to tell the
truth, 1 ﬁnd the colors attracs
tivc. Most important, however,
is their runctionality. The out
side visitor need no lougcr won-
(ler where Carnegie is, or which
building is Mcars cottage. I've
scert the cross country team use
them as hurdles, but I am 90%
conﬁdent that this is not part of
thrir usual work out. Remember
ruost larger schools have sinu.
tar markers, as do many a small
liberalrarts college. So i urge my
fellow uppcrclass mates to has
an open mind, and l, along witli
the cross country team, want to
see the markers returned to their
proper place. in the mean tiltte,
Steiner nail is the onc and a hair
story building right next to Her-
rick Chapel (that is the one with
stained glass windows).

on that note I'd like to make a
recommendation to the adminis-
tration and the trustees. In or
der to make Grinnell more like
a large university, we (my room
mate and I) would like to see
a statue and rountain erected
on central campus. The ins
scriptiou should rcad something
like this: “To our alinavmattcr,
without whom the endowment
would only be haltas big!" Sure
drunk people would be tempted
to bathe in the rountaiu, but is

rinnell experience

this any worse than those who
feel obliged to urinate on the
tombstones? Isay no!

What discussion of my obs
scrvatious would be complete
without a, and I promise this,
bi-iefdiscourse on the infamous
“New Logo". Hell, yes it’s
ugly, but so was the old one.
And keep in mind, my friends,
this one won‘t last forever Ci.
tlter. I for one can feel a lit
tle pride in the new lo 0; or
mating slugs, it you ml. 1
have it hour a pretty reliable
source that the $40,000 came cc.
clllsl'rlelyfrom the $48,000 that I
will have aid Grinnell by May
or ‘88. hat happened to the
other $3,000, you may ask. It
went to buy six new digital VT
2205 and two lpt 5t] printers
for Loose Hail. Unfortnnately
four of these terminals, the two
printcrs (not to mention a-half
dozen building markers) have
been stolen. Gecz, what a waste
of my money, and boy am I get-
tiu pissedroﬂ'l

hiy ﬁnal note is one that best
illustrates the BIG changes in
the period of my brief stay ill
Grittnell. When I was a first
semester freshman, the seniors 1
know used to.tcase me because
I couldn't get into the Pub until
second semester Well the Pub
is closed now, and believe inc,
Heetor's is not the same. How»
cvcr, I am here to tell all tlte
freshmen and women that they
won‘t be able to get into Links
until they areJumors. Ha! Now
maybe I ant getting a little ex-

:ited about graduation,

 

 

Former ~ sports editor
criticizes articles

To The Editor: c

As a pasts orts writer and ed-
itor for the cadet and Black, l
am quite fnlniliarrwitlr the style
or writing necessary to make a
sports articlc both (actual and
entertaining. i do think, how-
ever, that Grant Erlich's Corns
iuentr in last week's issue re
garding the soccer and volleyball
teams were inappropriate

Was it necessary to include
names or Grinnell alumni “ru-
mored to hr in the stands"?
What was thc purpose or telling
the readers about “the soccer
team travcling to Argentina for
a much talked about match
with the defendin World Cup
champs"? Finally, it A_uiy Crawl

is a valuable asset to the volley»
ball team, why wasn’t her talent
hi hli htsd? instead, Mr. Er-
lic jo ed about Ms. Growl be-
ing sidelined ror excessive bril~
house in Division III play. The
tone ofthese articles was border.
ing on sarcasm, not sports writ-
m
vrtnnell College striims ror ex-
cellertce in all areas, includ-
iu athletics. For the come
mltmelit to maintain this ex-
celleuce, the coaches and team
members deserve respect and
the beneiit of asitive media
coverage, not ill- ounded humor.
nespcctiuily yours,
Paula Rue, ’88

 

Correction

in the article “Students reilcct
on tirue in France" last wcek,
Paul Ryan was incorrectly iden
tiﬁed as Paul Ratté.
