r Ensemble members dressed in full

ﬁ “For this performance, said
Chenette, “the flutist played from
‘ within a giant 9-foot by 6~foot bird-
rcage, portraying one ofthe birds that
”the monarch tries to teach to sing."

v

“The piece is an
extravagant,
disturbing, and
poignant portrayal
of the madness of

King George III”
- Jon Chenette

entitled “Rising Blue." which was

designed for violin and electronic .

tape by John Morrison, an Iowa»
based composer.

.“Concertino Mediterraneo" by
fellow Iowan Linda Robbins
Coleman, was described by Chenette
as “a lighthearted romp through
various European musical styles,"

Coleman, who has been reSident
composer for the Drake University
theater, was the ﬁrst Iowa woman to
serve as composer in residence with
the Cedar Rapids Symphony Orches-
tra. She has studied with Athens’

scored forty plays that cover an ex—
tensive period of time

The Minnesota Ensemble is also
giving a seen
and concert
devoted en-
tirely to new
and never»
before per-
fo r m e d
works,

At that
time, the
group will
perform a
reading of
pieces come
posed by
Grinnell students

“I am thrilled to have the oppor-
tunity to hear it played by a presti-
gious ensemble!" said Aron
Raeho’98, of his composition.

Racho. a Music/Psychology
double major, wrote a piece entitled
“Variations." It was designed for pie
ano and violin and is based on a fa-
miliar tune by the Beatles: “Yellow
Submarine.“

“It progresses from a pastiche-
quasi—romantic excursion to a cone
trasting, stable ostinato section where
the theme is passed from the violin
to the piano, and then ends with it
kind ofdescent into madness," noted
Racho.

Racho and other students in
Chenette’s Composition course
wrote pieces specially to be per-
formed by the Ensemble.

“Upon hearing about the oppor-
tunity to have (my composition)
played live," said Racho, “I tiled to
make it as cool as possible!"

The Ensemble will read student
compositions today from 9-12 am.
in the Forum South Lounge. The ca-
sual atmosphere of the performance
is designed to allow students to Come
and go as their schedule allows.

Students are encouraged to attend
and support Grinnellian composers
in their debuts with this prestigious
ensemble.
