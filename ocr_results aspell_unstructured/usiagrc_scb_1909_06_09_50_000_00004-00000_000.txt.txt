1L Communication Allclll the Academy
Debate PINS.

Scarlet and Black: In regard to the
editorial published in the Scarlet and
Black c

presented to this year's Academy der

oncerning the pins which were

hating team, we worriri lice to make a
statement in order to lite some misr
understanding to be
among the student body at the present

The idea has originated that

“llich seems
time.
these pins are nearly a duplicate or
the Honor "Cr” pin, hut such is not
the case, horrever In the first place,
these pins lack only OlIe'SlXLcenLll ot
an inch of being onerhall as large as
the Honor 't pin. 0n the lace oi
those pins are the letters "G. A.” anti
also the words “Honor Debate," These
designations make the pin altogether
“G” Dill.
Moreover, before these piiis were ord
ered the consent oi; the right ot' using
these pins was obtained Ironi the Ath-
letic Council, and it was only with the
consent at that Council that the pins
and therelore it would

diflerent from the Honor

were given,
scent that it shoirld follow that we
should he allowed to use these pins.
we hope that this explanation will
clear away much misunderstanding
n inch seems to reign concerning this

Acun nir DEUA'AIXG 'l .

llll‘il'lcgllu rug the ahove callllullnl'
cation we would sa The Scarlet and
Black still maintains its positron that
the design adopted by the Academy
tor their debating pin is an intringe-
nrent upon the Atlrlctic "lloual' G.”
Granted that consent was given tor
the rise or this pin by the Board ol
Control and gr itiiig that the pin is
not as large as the conventional “Hort
or (5," yet from a distance it could
not be distinguished troni that pin.

11' the ‘ lonor G" is to mean any
thing, its individuality iiirist he pre-
st red. No pin, in our opinion, should
in any ay rcsenihlc it even though
the lettering and design may he slight
ly dilroreiit. The “Honor G" is 171'6‘
soiited to t'rriuiioll athletes as a token
of appir .tion for their soilices and
horrid rct‘uso to wear any pin

hell, licc rsc ot‘ the messages it brings
#tllc message ot‘ the gospel preached
iir cllnllul halls, thc tidings ol the ll e-
doin and liloadening thought, taught

in the cl ., com to its call, and the

 

declaration at the set ntr-ol and prih»
tic spirit that won the athletic victor-
ies it proclaims. For all these reasons
we love it.

On Saturday night after :t Cheering
evening message from our hell, the joy
of many was turned to anger, as we
tossed in our beds and longed for rest,
May I beg of the more thoughtful stir
dents and of the Faculty never again
to allow such torture inﬂicted on the
sick of the neighborhood, not to speak
of those who are well, hilt inrist have
rest or else be sick.

We are told that the contest was
won by men who did what they ought
instead or what they wanted, and who
subordinated private interest to public
good. These qualities were utterly he-
lied hy the actions ol those who pro-
claimed the victory. There are places
where the students are hated by the
citizens of the town; may it never be
so iii Griunell. At least, I pray t u,
let not the College bell he the iris
iiieiit of torture. Permit rrs to bless
arid not curse it.

It may he that in their excess

ot the day, those who were celebrating
it went to extremes, brit we are asst
cd that it was lorgetrulnoss rather

than any malicious spirit towards the,

townspeople that prompted it. We cari-

iiot hut teel that the writer or the
above has greatly overestimated the
sanctity oi the College hell and the
exit results at Saturday night‘s iriyot
ity and would make the otleiise iiirrch
greater than is lustitiahle on the 'u is
01 what actually occurred.

The meeting or the Junior- class can

of choosing representatives to the new;

attended and a great deal ot interest
was niaiiitested iii the election or the
representatives. The method used war.
that which has prevailed in Annual
Board elections in the past, and the
tollowing were chosen: \v. A, Ziegler,

The Freshman class some time ago
chose Anna Carter as its representa
tire. The Sophomores have not chosen
as yet and prohahly will not do so urr
