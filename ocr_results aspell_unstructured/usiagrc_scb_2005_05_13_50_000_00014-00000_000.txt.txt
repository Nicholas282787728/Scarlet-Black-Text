Israel, Palestine

one last

In last week’s KGB, Alex Muller ‘07 made a number of
claims concerning the history otrhc lsraelePaicstinc conflict
in a racism-based polemic against The Palestinian solidar-
ity Group. It will take a while, but we believe the historical
inaccuracies and prejudice displayed in his letter are egree
gious enough to warrant a detailed rcsponse This is that
response.

In describing the second lnrifada that erupted in 2000,
Alex alludes to rhe Palestinian rejection otrhc camp David
II summit, which he claims “offered the Palestinians nearly
all of the land that lsracl captured during the 1967 War.”

His characterization is false for a number of reasons.
What Barak offered to the Palestinian Authority at Camp
David was a folmllla for continued Israeli
military occupation under the name of a
“store." The proposal would have meant
no territorial contiguity for the Phlesnn‘
ian state, no control ofits external borders.
limited control of its own water resources

pied territory as required by international
law.

In addition, the Barak plan would have
included continued Israeli military conrrol over large scge
merits of the West Bank, including almost all of the Jordan
Valley; included the military conrrol ofthe third holiest site
in Islam, al»Haram aleSharif (which Israel refers to as the
‘Temple Mount'), where “Israel, incredibly, also demanded
Palestinian agreement to the construction ofa synagogue";
codified the right oflsracli forces to be deployed in the Fal—
estinian state on short notice; meant the continued presence
of fortiﬁed Israeli settlements and Jewish-only roads in the
heart of the Palestinian state', and required nearly 4 million
Palestinian refugees to relinquish their fundamental human
rights in exchange for compensation to be paid not by Israel
but by the “international community." (Source: "How Gene
erous is Generous?” in CROSSROADS OF CONFLICT:
Israeli-Palestinian Relations Face an Uncertain Future,
FMEP special Report, winter 2000).

John Mearsheimer, a professor in the department of Po-
litical science at the Universiry of Chicago, recognized the
limitations ofwhat Palestinians were being asked ro accept as
a final settlement, concluding that “it is hard to imagine the
Palestinians accepting such a state, Certainly no other nation
in the world has such curtailed sovereignty.“ (Source: “The
Impossible Partition," New York Timer, January 11, 2001).
Robert Mallcy, who was Clinton's special assistant for Arab—
Israeli affairs, participated in the Camp David negotiations.

In an important article entitled “Fictions About the Fails
ure Ar Camp David" published in the New York Times on
July 8, 2001, Malley added his own “insider’s" challenge to
the Camp David inyrli typiﬁed by Alex's (mis)conceptlons.
Not only did Mallcy agree that Barak’s offer was far trom
ideal, but he made the additional point thatArafat had made
far more concessions than anyone gave him credit for.

Mallcy wrote: Many have Come ro believe that the Pal-
estinians rejection or rhc Camp David ideas exposed an
underlying rejection of Israel’s right to exist. But consider
the fae he Palestinians were arguing for the creation of
a Palestinian state based on the June 4, 1967, borders liv-
ing alongside Israel. They accepted the notion ofIsraeli an-
nexation‘ofwcst Bank territory to accommodate settlement
blocs.

They accepted the principle of Israeli sovereignty over
the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalemmneighbor-
hoods that were not part of Israel before the Six Day War
in 1957. And, while thcy insisted on rccognirion ofthc rcfue
gees’ right of return, they agreed that ir should be imploe
mentcd in a inanncr rhat protccrcd Israel's demographic and
security interests by limiting the number of returnees. No
orhcr Arab parry that has negotiated with Israel— not Ana
war clesadat’s Egypt, not l<ing Hussein's jordan, let alone
Hafez al—Assad’s syria—cvcr came close to even considering
such compromises."

Malley rightly concluded that, “lfpeacc is to bc achieved,

detailed reiponrc.

/t Will take a while, but... the
ﬁlitorr'ta/ r'natturacres and prejudice
displayed in [Miller’s] letter are
and no full Israeli withdrawal from occu- egregrous enough [0 warranla

t -
the parties cannot afford to tolerate the growing acceptance
of these myths as reality."

Additionally, Alex claims that sixty-cighr percent or the
1948 Palestinian refugees followcd rhe advice ofIraq’s Nuri
Said to “temporarily cvacuatc their homes until they were
no longer under Zionist ‘threat,"' As Israeli historian Benny
Morris concluded in his book, T/ic Bil-ll; of”): Pulertr'rrmrr
Reﬁrgcrv Prob/cm, 1947-1949, this claim is highly dubious.
Using ii map showing the 36‘) Arab towns and villages in
Israel (within its 1949 borders), Morris lists, area by area, thc
reasons tor rhc dcpnrturc ofthe local population. In 45 cases
he admits that he does not know.

The inhabitants of the other 228 localities ﬂed under
atrack by Jewish troops, and in 41 cases
they were ex llcd by military force. In
90 other locali es, the Palestlnians were
in a state of panic following the fall of a
neighboring town or village, or in fcar of
an enemy attack, or because ofrumors cirn
culaled by the lcwish atmyipartieularly
after the April 9, 1948 massacre onSO in-
habitants of Deir Yassin, when the news of
the killings swept the country like wildfire.
By contrast, he found only six cases ofdeparrures at the ins
stigatlon of local Arab authorities.

Moreover, Alex claims that contrary to “popular belief,"
UN resolution #242 does not call on Israel to withdraw from
the territories of Gaza, the Golan Heights, and the West
Bank occupicd during the June '67 SiltrDay War. The lan-
guage ofrhc resolution is unambiguous. It clearly states that
the establishment ofa just and lasting peace in the Middle
East should include, among other things, the “Withdrawal
of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the re»
cent conflict."

Finally, Alex claims that because of “Muslim” political
language, the real reason that those Palestinian masses (many
of whom are Christian or secular) rebelled is not because of
the situation they lived in, but because tlley thoughr that the
PansArab world was in trouble. This is an erroneous claim
considering Palestine‘s historic rejection by Pan—Arabism.

lu facr, he refrains from addressing Palestinians by name
at all, only implying that in general “Arabs" or “Muslims" all
believe one thing, and therefore "Arabs" or “most Muslims"
can speak for Palestinians.The issue ofPalestinian self-den
termination is about Paler/r‘rii'mr ldyrdulur‘mirmlion, not what
Iranians think, or what Saudi Arabians think. Or for that
matter, what Louis Farrakhan (the leader of the African-
Amcrican Nation of Islam) thinks.

Alex’s argument engages in Arab and Muslim essentials
ism. Not only does he fail to grasp the fact that the two
are not [be mine lbl'ng, he furthermore reduces both (really a
single entity in his mind) to Islamic fundamentalism. This
is racism.

The discursive operation hc wishes to perform on these
two groups is the same move by which the religious right in
this country declarcs “antiewar is llliti~Amcricail is pro-rer-
rorism" (compare to Alex’s formula, “anti-Israel is antirSCr
mitic is pro—terrorism"). After all, would it be reasonable in
any context to claim that all “white" people are “Evangellcal
Christians" opposed to gay marriage and a woman's right to
choose?

The problem is that in the current cultural climate, gene
eralizations like Alex’s about Arabs often trn‘ taken as rear
sonablc. we sincerely liopc that we were not the only stu—
dents on campus appalled by Alex's patently racist remarks.

Furthermore, in this day and age, the American news
media often misrepresents the current and hisroi-ical realities
ofthe Israel-Palestine connict. These trends deeply disturb
us, compelling us ro confront them wherever they roar their
ugly heads, especially when close to home, at grcar liberal
Grinnell.

Fair pay for
custodians

We appreciate our custodians and the other Facilities
Management (FM) employees who make our lives so much
cleaner, brighter and generally better.

We have to admit, however, that we're not saying this
because it‘s Custodian Appreciation Day or Week, or just
to make our dorm custodians feel loved. Instead, we say this
because we want to support their stewards and union leads
ers in the upcoming contract negotiations this summer. We
wanr the college to give all FM workers, including custodi-
ans, a raise that reﬂects rising costs of living, as well as the
importance of rhe work they do on campus

Last week, three custodians spoke to the 5&7]? about
their hopes and fears for this summer's negotiations. The
custodians spoke ro us only under the condition of anonym»
ity, and only alter we learned of the upcoming negotiations
and sought them out. Their choice of anonymity reveals a
fear of consequences unfamiliar to students: after all, our
families’ livelihoods do not depcnd on our employment at
this institution.

Three years ago, when contracts were last negotiated,
custodians were given a mere one
percent raise, less than other 13M
employees and well below the
rate of inﬂation, We hope that
this summer, negotiations will
result in an even raise across all
categories of FM employment.
The disparity in the last con-
tracts probably stemmed from
the fact that there are more cuss
todians than there are grounds
crew and trade employees, making it more affordable to give
these employees a higher raise. Nevertheless, equal wage ins
creases among different types of FM workers will demon-
srratc the College’s understanding of the value of custodial
work, which, despite many male custodians at Grinncll and
elsewhere, is often considered traditionally “women’s"wotk.

Rather than listen to Grinnell smdent opinion, FM has
sometimes chosen to listen to the recorded opinions of other
institutions’ students. In November, 2002, 94 percent of vot-
ing students expressed support for a student initiative asking
FM to avoid team cleaning and keep custodians on their
family~friendly 7 am. to 3:30 pm. shift. The next spring, in
defense of FM’s practice of scheduling new positions from
4 to 12:30 a.m,,Direetor of FM Mark Godar cited opinion
data from other schools indicating that students didn't want
to see their custodians

At other schools, such as Harvard, student protests and
activism have contributed to college employee labor organ
nization.The timing of contract negotiations, based on the
college's fiscal year, makes this type of student input diffi-
cult here at Grinnell. What we can do, however, is give the
college enough feedback rhar they can't cite other schools’
scatisrics and say we don't care.

Talk to your custodian and ask how you can help. Write
letters to President Osgood, to trustees, to FM, to Mark
Godar, reminding thcm or the importance ofall FM em—
ployees to our educational and residential environment. Ask
parents and alumni to do the same. When you get back in
the fall, talk to your custodians about how negotiations went
and ifimprovcments have been made.

The purpose of this editorial is not to demonize top FM
administrators College power does not rest solely in FM’s
hands. They are in turn constrained by the budget allotted
to them.

A few months ago, many or us here at the seas and
elsewhere on campus opposed next year's 6.5 percent raise
in tuition. Given this unfortunate event, however, Grinnell
should have plenty of money to give FM’s employees fair
contract conditions. Not doing so would make a mockery
of the remnants of Grinnell's imagc as a socially conscious
IHSIIIUIIOIL

We stand in solidarity with custodians and other FM
employees in the upcoming negotiations.

We want the (o/lege to
give a// FM workers , a
