Smith Defeats
l-Langan Artists

Upsets Dope by Winning in
ISpeedhall Game by
Score .of 8-3.

A fast and scrappy speedball team
from Building One upset the dope
when they turned back the wouldbc
champions from Langan by the score
or 5-3 Thursday afternoon.

This upset rather subdues Laue
,gan's hopes for the cup as Dibble
hall is now in the lead with a perfect
record. If Langnn wins from Dibble
inext week, the championship will be
'tied up.

This is the first victory that Smith
:hall has marked up this year but
she deserved it. The team that
Smith hell put on the field Thursday
afternoon could probably have beat-
ien any team in the league. The prime
ciple reason for their victory was
the perfect cooperation between the
offensive and defensive lines.

It would be hard to pick the stars
.of the game but Greene. Tebbens and
Clark from Smith and Kent, Foval
and l—lipp from Langan were prob-
ably largely responsible for the Squ
cess of their teams.

This contest the second half of a
game host was started three weeks
ago. Smith Hal! led 4-3 at the half.

Dibble Snows Powel-

Dibble in her game with Smith
Monday afternoon Showed that she
still had the power to score when
pressed by winning s-o. With De-
Long and Farrnra in the forward line
and Tatom playing a sterling game
at defense, Dibble showed champion-
ship caliber.

In the second game this week,
Langan turned back Building Four
by a score of we, thus ringing up
the highest score made this season.
While playing a fairly aggressive
game, Two lacked its usual punch
and drive. Four put up a rather
’Weak defense.

The outstanding players of the
last few weeks have been Farrera of
leble. Kent of Langan and Bath of
Smith. These men have not only
been the backbones of their teams
but high scorers as well.

Twelve games have been played
leaving only three more contests. It
is expected that these games will he
played this coming week.

The standing of the teams at the
present are:
