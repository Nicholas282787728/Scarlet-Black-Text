Crime rate down

According to a story in the Jan. 27
G innell Herald-Register, police
statistics indicate an overall decrease
in crimes last year'as compared to the
1981 statistics. The sharpest decreases
were in larcenies and break-ins,

Police Chief Bill Peters said that in-
cidents of vandalism, which fell slightly
last year, would have dropped even
more were it not for a rash oI such
crimes in a six-week period at the end
of the year. Peters indicated that the
lower totals in larcenies and break-ins
might have risen during the year due to
the situation of the economy, but fell ul-
stead.

Arrests fell slightly last year, due
largely to a sharp decrease in juvenile
arrests. Those arrests went from 81 to
69. Overall, 2,066 complaints were filed
and 162 arrests reported last year.

Students attacked

Three students, Geoff Reiner and Ed
and Bill Maschmeler, escaped injury
last Saturday night as they were walk—
ing back to their North Campus dore
mitory and were nearly run over by a
car driven by a local youth, a minor,
The youth had originally insisted that
the students provoked the attack by
throwing snowballs at his car, but
statements from the students and
evidence gathered by the police in»
dicated otherwise.

Police examined the car later that
night tor signs of such provocation, but
could not find any such evidence. The
youth then confessed that the attack
had indeed been unprovoked.

According to Reiner, the police will
press reckless driving charges against
the driver. The case will be heard in
Magistrate‘s Court either next week or
the following week to determine if the
case should be brought to trial. Relner
said that Police Chief Bill Peters pro-
mised to do all that he can to convince
the magistrate judge to send the case to
trial, '

Students confess in fraud incidents

New phone

by Ilene Welsh-dd

Although the problem of toll abuse on the
Grinnell campus has been solved, GTE
hopes to educate students on the issue, and
the college intends to further improve the
phone system.

A new cutover system was installed
before this semester began, according to
Physical Plant Director Dale Hawn. There
was some abuse last September, he said,
and it became popular in early October,
ending in late October. He explained that
the GTE system computer lacked the pros
per software to stop the abuses.

“There was a little defect in the software
in the new switch which did not stop toll
abuse," Hawn said,

GTE has taken reponsibility for in—
vestigation and tor dealing with the
abusers. Any student involved will work
directly with the telephone company as
any citizen would, according to Hawn.

Although toll fraud is a criminal offense
in Iowa, the company wants to avoid proA
secuting, according to GTE Securtiy

system eliminates fraud

Manager Roger Soukup. He maintains that
the studens misusing the phones are not
out to defeat the system, but instead are
probably just looking tor a convenient way
to save money. Nevertheless, they need to
understand the severity of toll fraud, and
realize that someone must bear the cost.

Many studenu have already called in to
admit they abused the system, according
to Mick Thomas, an agent of GTE and the
person responsible for identiiying students
involved. None of ﬁle students have been
prosecuted, he said.

Thomas refused to comment on how
much money is involved in the fraud ins
cidents.

While GTE is investigation the incidents,
Grinnell is working to improve the current
phone system. The college has already
taken numerous precautions, said I-Iawn.
Because of the new software, it is nwrly
impossible to beat the system. The
operators will be verifying all billings, ac-
cording to the director. This will further

limit toll abuse.

He explained that the operator will re-
main on the line until the call is verified by
a credit card number or the person accep-
ting the call. The operator will be cut off
when the connection is made.

“It is impossible to listen in on a conver-
sation. . .conversation privacy is
guaranteed after the connection is made,"
Hawn emphasized.

Both Hawn and Soukup emphasized the
need to educate students in the severity of
toll abuse. Students must realize that these
calls do not pass unnoticed.

GTE will continue to Conmct students
who have not yet contesscd, commented
Soukup. There will be people on campus to
speak with the students involved, and Col
lege officials will be notified of these visits.

Hawn remarks that although toll abuse
Is a serious problem, he is looking forward
to moving on to better things. He en-
courages students to acknowledge their
negligence, and accept the responsiblity so
the problem can be rectified.

Main Event to ring in the New Year

by Rob Valenti

The residents of Main Hall will attempt
something they believe has never been
done before at Grinnell College: throw a
New Year's Eve party on Feb. 5. Promp~
ted by several dismayed observations that
most Grinnell students never get a chance
to celebrate the new year together, this
year's Main Hallers will try to make a
dream become a reality.

The theme of the decorations will be
“Times Square, New York." A movie mar»
quee at the entrance made with lights
donated by Clark Hall and a mural of Ute
NewYork City skyline will lend themselves
to the theme. Tapped kegs will be disguis~
ed as New York trademarks like the Staten
Island Ferry and a checkered cab. At mida
night, in the New York tradition, a ball fill»

KDIC taps charts in survey

by Ken Scotton

KDIC is the number-one radio station
among students at Grinnell College, at
least according to the 240 respondents to
last semester’s KDIC survey. In fact,
students on the average listen to KDIC 5.3
hours a week, two more hours than KDIC’S
main competitor, KUNI. KRNA, KMGK
and K660 also picked up some listener-
ship {or their top-40 music that KDIC does
not supply.

The respondents also named -“classic
rock" as their favorite type of music.
strong preferences were also indicated for
reggae, classical, jazz, blues, new wave
and soitrcck. Least duirable ratings went
to ‘acid rock and country/western.

In an analysis to see if KDIC DJ’S and
non-DJ’s have the same musical tastes, it
was found that non-DJ'S like folk, jazz,
topAo, soft—rock, acid rock and women’s
music more than DJ’s do. The listeners are
also not as wild about funk, punk or new
wave as the local radio jocks are.

Among special programming, KDIC’s
listeners expressed an interest in hearing

concertsv comedy, .old radio‘serios and.

unusual (ethnic) music on thier radios.

News did not fare well. Only three per-
cent of those surveyed said KDIC was their
main news source. One-half oi the students
have never listened to the evening news
and the news, in terms of quality, was
rated at 4.6, on a lopoint scale.

People would like to see KDIC run a little
more professionally. Its current rating of
professionalism is 5.1. Students
would like to see it a little higher. at 6.7. In
their comments, students noted that
although they didn't want the slick style of
a top-40 station, they also didn't want the
music to be marred by loose, opinionated
talk and over emphasized mistakes that
currently plague the airwaves at 33.5 FM.

The KDIC board is taking these com-
ments and statistical data into considera
tion in planning the schedule and direction
for KDIC this semester. The board is most
concerned with trying to cure the ills of the
station that cause people to turn their dial
to KUNI, mainly for better news, and also
to hear classical, blues, jazz and folk.
KDIC is gearing towards having more

shows incorporating these types or music .

and loss at a straight rock format.

ed with “goodies” and 150 balloons will be
dropped.

There was, however, concern over the
possibility cl hyperventilation. “We're go-
ing to need a lot at hot air to till up all of
those balloons! " said one worried Main
Hall member. Fortunately, the 150 helium-
tilled balloons will be filled by a gas tank.

One twist will be a Father TIme booth.
Mr. Time is looking icrward to being at his
station all night to hear people's New
Year’s resolutions. He optimistically says
that ii there are suiticient funds, there will
bea "special treat” tor all those who “spill
meir guts."

Like the last all-campus party, the
James Hall Bacchanal, the Main Event
will also be a costume party, The theme
will be “Come As Your Favorite Year "
Concerning the theme, Main Hall council
member Lou Kersten had this to say: "We
don’t want anyone coming to the party
with a ribbon and a sign on them that says
1971 or something "

To cover the cost of the refreshments,
Main Hall has been raising lunds since
mierecembel‘ This past week, represen-
tatives have been sitting outside the dining
halls collecting donations and distributing
party hats and noisemakers tor contribu~
tions of 50 cents or more.

Main Hall has formally announced that
the Keg-o-Hunt prize has been lound by
Mark CDnteratO. a RushrMed sutdent. The
KegoHunt was a Main Hall tundraiser
created by Chris Mortika of Main Hall.
The contest consisted of 11 different clues
sold for 75 cents each, all leading to, if in-
terpreted properly, either another better
clue or the goal of the hunt, a slip of paper
located somewhere on campus entitling
the finder to either a keg of beer or $25.

With regards to what ﬁnally tipped him
on, Conterato said that it was the riddle
that was printed in the 5&3 on the last day
of ore contest. “It was about live lines. It
took me about 15 minutes to get it." When
asked whether he took the keg or the
money, he replied, "Are you kidding? The
keg oi course! " .

The card was in drawer 532 of the card
catalog in Burling Library.

The residents of Main Hall had decided
to change the ﬁnancial policy slightly trom
that of previous allcampus parties. Any
excess funds collected will be handed
directly over to the hall that is having the
next all-campus party, in this case Loose
Hall, so that its members will not need to
solicit as much money from the rest of the
campus. In addition to this, the volume of
the suburbs, the band playing at the Main
Event, will not be as great as David
Johansen’s band, so that sensitiveeared
people need not be turned away.

.,i The.party begins at~9230 pm. in.Darby..
. College in. s are required. '
