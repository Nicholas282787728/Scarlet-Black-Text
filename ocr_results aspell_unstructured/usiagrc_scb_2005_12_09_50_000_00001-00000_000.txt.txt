Grinnell has had substance-free housing for two years now, starting
with Smith. The addition of Kershaw this year begs the question

Does sub-free work?

BY TIFFANY Au

Many students associate weekends with "beerrar
mids” in lounges and vomit on bathroom ﬂoors. For
some, these are traditional relics of college life, be
they endearing or annoying. But over the
last several years, an increasing number
of students have been asking for a liv-
ing environment that doesn’t subject
them to the effects of drunkenness.
Others have gone further and asked
for help setting up dorm communi-
ties that don't revoIVe around alcor
hol.

Student Affairs responded with
substance-free housing, in which
students are expected not to consume
alcohol or drugs or come to the build
ing while under the inﬂuence of those
substances. In the fall of2004, Smith Hall was
declared substancerfree, followed this year by Kershaw
Hall. Student reaction to substanCErfree housing has
been mixed, with residents generally in favor but othr
ers expressing concerns about the
concept.

Smith’s substancerfree status
was the result of increasing student
interest for an alcohol-free living
environment. William Dawson '07,
the SA for Smith 3rd, thought that
the idea was very successful. ”Never
has one person shown evidence of
not being subafree," he snid.“1fyou
have close community, it’s harder to escape commlr
nity pressure. ”

That sense otcommtrniry has developed in smith.
"Living in subrfree [housing] gives you options and
living here gives you choice," said smith resident
Thomas Christensen ’08. “It really expands room for
conversation,”

    
 
  
  

 

”There is no way to ensure that
people who want to get in sub-
frce [housing] get in . . [and]
that those who don’t, don’t”

 

Students felt that there was a stigma to living in
Substance»free housing. “People joke that iryotr are in
Smith, you don’t have fun," Dawson said. “I try to

make myselfnot a Smith stereotype, so I say I like
the [dorm] room instead.”

Part of the debate over substance-
free housing revolves around how smr
dents are placed into the substance
tree dorms, While many people in
Smith and Kershaw are substance-
free, others are not, and that creates
conﬂict.
"sub-tree housing is not really
enforced,” said Amanda Cm‘mnzn
'09, a resident of Kershaw, “People
come in dnlnk [and] have drinks in
their room.”
Students in Kershaw said that while
the majority of residents are substance-free, as
many as 20 percent drink in their rooms. Another 5in
able amont are substance-free in Kershaw but drink
elsewhere.

Kershaw resident Mart Scharr
’08 thinks that the idea of sub
stance—free housmg is ﬂawed. “The
problem with sub-free is that, one,
there is no way to ensure that peo-
ple who want to get in subrftcc get
in, and two, that those who don't,
don’t," he said.

Upperclassnicn pick their
dorm in the standard room draw
at the end of the year. Incoming ﬁrstryenrs, however,
are assigned a dorm based on their responses to a sut~
Vey. The survey asks students to indicate whether or
not they are interested in Substanccrfrec housing, and

if so if that housing is a priority. Many students fill

Students in
Pub fight

Football players "tried to break
up" fight by other bar patrons,

but became involved.

BY TRVMORE MAGOMANA

At a quarter to midnight last Thursday, somebody
called the Grlnnell Police Department dispatcher to
report a “disturbance":lt 926 Main Street, the location
ofthe Down Under Pub.

, The distuibance turned out to be a free-for-all
right between Grinncll college football players and
people from town.

One student who was involved in the disturbance
was granted anonymity because of pending legal
charges.

“Basically, a group or us tried to break up an alter
cation between some townies and it got completely
out ofhand,"the student said. “Instead ofthern realiz-
ing that we were attempting to break up their dispute,
they thought we were trying to escalate it." '

A heated ﬁght Within the confines of the pub be
tween the students on one side and “townies” on the
other side followed.

Grinnell police officer Mike Smith arrived at the
scene a few minutes later. Smith referred all questions
regarding the incident to Police Chieflody Matherly
Mathcrly was not available for comment before press
time.

According to the student involved, prior to the
police arriving on scene, the students tried to resolve
the situation. He said that Grinnell College students
tried to extricate themselves from the fight by runr
ning out of the Pub.That effort failed when the nuns
students involved did not stop aghtlng.

“When we left they continued to pursue us out-
side," the student said. “While some students still
tried to keep the peace they were attacked by multiple
townies and itiust turned into a big fight in the con-
struction area,"

Peter Leo ’06 was in the Pub on the night of the
right. “I didn't
see anything
happen at
the Pub that
n i g h t t h a t
was instigat-
ed by [cole
lege] stun
dents,” Leo
said. “By the time i realized there was a ﬁght going
on, many or the individuals involved were already ex-
iting the Pub [through] the front door."

The student said that the fight was not a fair one.

“Certain students took the brunt of the attacks
because they were outnumbered. Some students at-
tempted to help but were held back by other Grinnell
students," he said.

All people involved in the fight were apprehend-
ed by police. “[Thc right] didn't last very long,” the
student said. “It ended with the cops placing us up
against the wall."

Lee said that police cars pulled up opposite the
Strand movie theatre in downtown Grinnell. “As far
as I know, no one was Issued a citation." said Leo.
After the police bloke up the fight the altercation
seemed to be over.

“A group orstudcnts, niyselrinclodcd,waited out-
side the Pub for a few moments to make sure that
any other students involved made it home without
incident,"said Leo.

Russ Motta, assistant director or security, was
skeptical that students were to blame for inciting the
fight. “It is very rare for our snidents to be involved in
rights," he said. “Very rare."

 

”/ didn’iiee anything that
night that was instigated by
[ta/hat] students.”
