Iowa ACLU leader discusses new Patriot Act

Civil liberties group objects to the recently passed law saying that it gives the law enforcement agencies too much power

by Erik Gable
Staff Writer

Ever since the September 11 attack on the
World Trade CenterY many civil libertarians have
worried about the federii government overstepping
constitutional bounds in its nttempts to punish
those responsible, Wednesdiy night, in the ﬁrst
event to be sponsored by criiinell's new chapter or
the American Civil LilJEHICS Union, lawyer and
activist Ben stone visited campus to address those
concerns,

Stone is the executive director ofthc Iowa Civil
lecnics Union, the ﬁfth-oldest ACLU afﬁliate in
the country, A native orDes Memes, he received
his Master's degree from Iowa State Uiuveisity in
1990 and gmdudtcd from the Iciw sdtool at Duke
University in 1995.

Before launching into his mniii Subject, the
“Patriot Act" that recently passed Congress by in
overwhelming margin, Stone listed the ACLU:
objection: to the Bush administration's handling
orrhe September 11 ottermath: rot example, tale
ing at least 700 people into custody on qliKSUOn—
nble grounds and deciding to interview about 5,000

young men from middle cistern countries 7 on oct
thot stone said “there's no wiy to avoid character
lllng as ethnic profiling."

stone said the Bush administration pushed the
Patriotnct through congress asquicidyos possible:
the House approved it on October 24, the senate a
diiy later. "There wns very little debate." he said.
“Members orcongrcss in the House huvc claimed
they never read it bcrore they voted for it."

The Sandi: is now holding hearings about how
much thegovernmentmnconsntuticnrillydo, but,
in stone's words, “the horse is out ortlie barn. Hear»
ings should have been held before the bill wns
pasted."

stone said he found the Patriot Act disturbing
on n number orrtonts, among them the fact that it
give fedeml law enforcement sgenrs more leeway
in siirveillince activities. The bill makes senrch
wnrrsnrs easier to obtain, nnd provides an option
for redernl ngcnrs to deny giving notice before a
warrant is executed, irthcy believe giving immedlr
ste notice would have idverse consequences.

“There's nothing new in thc law to forbid the
FBI from going into your home or oihcc, looking

.iround, checking things out, making copies or
documents, and then leaving,” stone snid. “And
you'd never know they were there. "

Another clause allows the FBI to nccess tele.
phone records and other information thnr would
otherwise be considered privntc, tithe notion is in
or :in anti—teriorisin investigntion, The bill siutes
that investigations sro not to be mnde solely on ihc

ductedsuch investigntions on questionable giouiids
in the past.

The bill define “domestic terrorism" is n crime

one orthe recent developments |li:i[ most dis.
turbcd stone and the ACLU, though it wisn’t pirt
or the Pntriot Act, was the recent declarition by

President Bush that non—citizens sccuscd eftcrror.
ism would be tried in militsry tribunals rather than
a court nrliw. Military tribunuls oircr rcw orthc
legnl protections that dorendents in the us. legal
system its entitled to. According to stone, appeals
are impossible nnd prosecutors need only a [wot
thirds inniotity orthc judging panel, either than o
uninimous verdict, to secure n conviction.

Aitorney General John Ashcroft recently ins
stated a regulution snowing federal agents to monit

stone suid the ACLU does support better air.

eluding putting sky moishnls on airplanes and re.

to prevent innltrntion. Hc wirned, however, thnt
