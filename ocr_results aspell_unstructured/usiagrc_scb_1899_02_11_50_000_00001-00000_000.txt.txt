The ﬁrst number on the pro
gram Friday afternoon wasa vocal
solo by Miss Clarke, which was
much enjoyed by the society.
The ﬁrst paperwasgiven by Miss
Tate on "Drama as Literature,"
The paper was exceedingly well
\vritten,and well given. The drama
as literature does not exist. The
requirements for success on the
stage arelso very different from
the requirements of literary per-
fection, that it is almost impossi—
ble to write drama
satisfy the demands of botli the
theatre-going and reading public.

Miss lohnson tollowcd with a
paper on the ”Advance in Ameri-
can Dramatic Art.” She spoke
especially oi the superiority oi
American actors and managers in
the careful attention they pay to
stage effect and in the inﬁnite
amount of time and trouble they
spend in perfecting their parts
She closed with a review of Fitch's
last play, "Nathan Hale." ‘lliis
paper was very easily and enters
tainingly written.

Miss Mehlin gave awell written
paper on “Types of Drama," trace
ing the drama in all its various
forms down to the present tinre.

Miss Williams gave a piano
solo, and responded to a hearty
encore. The society always espec~
ially enjoys music trom its own
members.

Miss Smith gave a talk oil the
“Ethical Drama." The drama,
according to the modern schoolr
should teach only as life teacher,

Friday evening the society pres
senied a farce, Paul Leicester
Ford‘s “Man Proposes.” Before
the play began, Harry'MlIlerd
sang “Hearest Thou," and also
responded to an encore. Mr,
Millard has a ﬁne voice and this
was one of the most enjoyable
musical numbe 'ich the soc
ciety has heard this year.

Those taking part in the play
were Misses Calla Hand, Emma

Lou Richards, Margaret Scam~
tnon and Orpha Fettit. The scene
of action is in a rich society home,
just after dinner and before a
masked ball. The plot is dccid»
edly larcical, telling of the ludi-
crous mistakes occasioned by a
change of dominos, which causes
all the proposals to be made to
the wrong girl. of course, at the
the end the perplexing knot is

The wide range of characters
to be impersonated call for di‘ae
matic skill and sympathetic inter
pretation. Mr. Cable knows his
creations thoroughly and can
make them live and leel, Bona-

llighrstrung teacher, is perhaps
the most difﬁcult character, and
Mr Cable wasverysuccessul in the
pottrztyal. Bonaventure was a
man of lofty ideals; his mission
that of ennobllng and enlighten-
ing liisrtellow nien. Education
was to him almostreligion. Scr-
vice and suppression ot selt were
the twin goals of his ambi on.
His little ﬂock of pupils were dear
to him as his own kin. while one
of them, Sidonie, threw a spell
over him that he could not cast
off. Teacher and scholars formed
a district group in this Acadlan
community. Then there were the
parents of the children, some re

suspicion, but all convinced of its

present, reﬁned, oitentimcs ex-
tremely subtle. was also enhanced
by the author's voice and manner.

The visitor of last evening will
not be torg’otten. and we count it a
real privilege to have been brought
face to face with the creator of a
series of delightful characters that
now hold a permanent and hon-
ored place in our growing nation-
al literature.

In addition to the pleasure of
the Friday evening entertainment
Mr. Cable courteously afforded
the students an opportunity of a
little further insight into his de-
liglitiul personality in his chapel
talk this morning.

Beginning with a iew‘sirnple
remarks about the truth at life as
the ultimate aim of culture, Mr.
cable led upto his deﬁnition ot
ﬁction as ”an artistic re-adjust-
ment of the tiuih.” Fiction in its
truest expression is really factr
the only thing about it that is not
a fact being the thread of the write
er's imaginative shaping, which,
so far lronl destroying facts only
embodies them into an expression
of the truth of life, Mr. Cable
spoke in a manner at once appre-
crative of the point of View of the
student body and sympathetic in
the truest sense with the spirit of
the best ptesenl-dm’ literature.

The important points of ilie
