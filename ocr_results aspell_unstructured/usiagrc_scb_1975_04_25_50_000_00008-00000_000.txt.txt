Returning to conference action,
the Grinnell tennis team recorded
two impressive victories this week
over Knox and Cornell. Dan Ede
wards tNo, 1), Andy Booom (No.
3), and Carter Newton (No. a)
continued theirwinning ways, each
upping their individual singles
records in conference play to 3.0,

After dropping their opening two
matches, the netmen ventured to
Knox last Saturday and came
away mm a as Win. victorious in
singles were Edwards (now zit no,
2), Bloom, Rick Kellar (No, 4),
Aaron stlverberg (No. 5), and
Newton. The number two doubles
pair of Bob Rosen and Andy Bloom
provided the added margin of
victory.

Cornell fell to the Pioneers 7»2
Wednesday at the PEC. Edwards,
back at first singles, shook oil the
effects of a sprained ankle to win
67, SrZ, 6-2. In the doubles, Newton
and Edwards played a line match
at the number one position, but
finally succumbed, 7,5, in the third
set. Also beating Cornell at singles
were Rosen (No. 2), Bloom, Kellar,
and Newton. Rosen and Bloom
captured second doubles. while at
number three, Kellar and John

Wartburg, and William Penn.

“Pointwise, we didn’t do
especially well, but performance
wise, we had an excellent day,”
commented Coach Maurice Hunt.
Hunt also noted that times were
slowed by an unusually muddy
track.

Grinnell winners were Mike
Nadalsky with a 42’s" triple jump;
the 440 relay team oi Bailey, Jim
Fallace, Kirk Krutilia, and
Schultz; ihree-miler Raub with a
time of 15:40; and Briles in a tie for
first in the 440 with a strong 53.6.

Briles also took second in the 220
in 24.7, as did Bailey in the 100 with
10.7,

The women only had skeletal
representation at Central. Chris
Stidley’s 6:08 mile was good for
second place, while Jenny
Paarlberg took third in the 100.

As neither Grinnell or William
Penn had enough women present
(or a 440 relay team, the two
schools combined forces, and the
“Pennell‘ (Dr William Grinnell?)
team grabbed a second place.
