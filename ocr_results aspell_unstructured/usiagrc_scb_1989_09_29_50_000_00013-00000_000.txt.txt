one loss, Against Lake Form on
Saturday. the women suffered a
tough 4-0 defeat,

“We just couldn’t get the ball in
the net," said Marta Fraboni, The
stats cenainly supportthis. Although
Grinnell out-shot Lake Forest 22-9,
the opposing team managed three
ideally placed shots. Three were hit
precisely in the upper corner of the
goal and the last was a hard drive.

The squad was very disappointed
with its efforts. especially in the first
half, during which three quick goals
shocked Grinnell into action.

The second half was a much dif-
ferent game, although it didn‘t turn
the score around. Stephanie Reis-
dorf and Anya Schwartz botlt re-
mained aggressive in their forward
positions. Jenny Wood ran the
midﬁeld well and was rewarded with
a punch from one of Lake Forest‘s

perseverance after that first half
nightmare," said coach Ted
Eskildsenl

That perseverance refers not only
to the second half in Chicago, but
also to the team’s comeback win on
Sunday against Beloit, 2-1r

Beloit scored immediately on a
comet kick. But thePioneers showed

for the rest of the half. With a score
of 10 Beloit, the Grinnell women
picked it up and showed Beloit who
wears the Umbro American Longs.

Jenny Wood nailed one in off a
Susan Thomas comer at about the
20—minute mark. The team was out
for blood nowt Spurned on by one
foul after another—the women out-
l‘ouled Beloit 22-6 —— the game
shifted in their favor, The balls were
hitting the net like ﬂies onto the ﬂy<
paper in Brown House, and it was
only a matter of time before one
would go in, '

the keepert “Spana” handled theball
well on Sunday, and her speed,
combined with that of Sara Conner
and Amy Reinhart, put fear into the
hearts of Beloit’s players

Speed and skill were irnponant in
this game and Grinnell had what it
took} en Hooper,Nancy Kaiser,Ris
Taylor and Susan Thomas kept the
backﬁeld clear of Beloit offenders
with pure animal instinct.

In late breaking news, Grinnell
beat Knox lastWednesdaybya score
of 1-0. with Sarah Conner scoring
the lone goal.

The women hope to keep their
rabid attitude when they meet St.
Benedict this Sunday at home. The
