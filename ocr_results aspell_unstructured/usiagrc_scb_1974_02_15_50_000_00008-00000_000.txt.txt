important measures were passed

Another key injury, this one to

place and perhaps sole possession

Also, ii a track man plays ior his
school’s footballteam andtheteam’s
quarterback plays pro baseball in
the summer, he is ineligible for
track. Expressing dissatisfaction
with thenew rule was Phillip Krumm
oi the usoc, The ivy league has
also voted to ignore the new rule,
which is not mandatory. Tennis
and gait already have pros and
amateurs playing in the same tourr
nament and there is nothing wrong
with it. In fact the only thing wrong
with the [dream rule is that the
AAU and USOC don’t go by it.
Pfitsch doesn’t expect the new pro-
am ruling to make a diiierence
towards the policy of the MAC
one way or another.

Pfitsch commented that, in regard
to the dropping oi the 2.0 rule,
“The NCAA doesn’t care about sc-
hools like us.” South Dakota State
athletic director Stanley Marshall
said of the 2.0 ruling (an athlete
must have a 2.0 average in high
school in order to' be eligible for
first semester competition), "It was
very diiiicult to implement in par
ticular because of the great diff—
iculty in obtaining high school tran-
scripts. Also there was a strong
feeling that 2.0 was near no stan-
dard at all and probably not worth
the eiiort oi implementing.“ What
this means is that a boy could flunk
out of high school in his senior
year and play tor a school not en,
forcing the 2,0 ruling. One NCAA
spokesman said that schools might
now accept “anyone who can walk
and chew gum at the same time."
Pitlsch commented that the nations
top “beef" iactory, University or
Texas, voted in favor of the 20
rule retention tor the bigger sch-
ools. Pfitsch, Who is in favor of
the government taking over the ad-
ministration uf athletics in this
country, said, “The 2.0 ruling was
inconsequential. Our standards are
higher than most people’s anyway,,,
I don’t know if other schools are
having admissions problems; this
might lower the standards."
