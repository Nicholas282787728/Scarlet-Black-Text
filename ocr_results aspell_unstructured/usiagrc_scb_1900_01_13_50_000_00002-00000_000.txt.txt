It seems entirely unnecessary
(or us to say that we belleve that
the lnen ot the institution appre~
ciate the beneﬁts to be derived
from the use of such a structure
as has just been completed on our
campus. It has been ii-ith no
small amount of effort that such a
building has been obtained and a
large amount of this effort came
from those who we would natural-
1y suppose, had little interest in
the college. Few institutions of
learning can boast or such a gym-
nasium and certainly no otherthe
size of Glinnell. Tlle beneﬁts to
be derived trorn gymnastic. work
were sufﬁciently emphasized last
night to need no mention hele, It
is to be hoped that every man of
the institution will show his ape
preciaiion by making the best
possible use of this advantage.

“The Three Falcs," “Three
Graces," "Psyche," “Flying Mei.
cury,” “The Gleanel's" and “The
Man with the Hoe.” The lifelllce-
ness of the attitudes was really lea
inarlrable, and “Flying Mercury"
was so heartily applauded as to
be recalled. “Psyche" was also
highly appreciated. The pro-
gram closed with a cake walk in
which all of the dolls participat-
ed. and in which the prize would
undoubtedly have been awarded
to-Greerly Gussie and Obstinate

opheha,it one had been given.
This lsalso repealcd in response
to an encore. The entire pel-
formancc was a thorough success,
and fully repald those who had It
in Charge tor the labor expended
on it.
