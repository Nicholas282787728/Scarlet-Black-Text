The DRAMATlC Club, through
whose enticavor'Sueet Lavender"
was produced on last Saturday
evening. has demonstrated its
right to a place among the them
bers of piosperoiis college oigani.
zationsr The club was organized
early in the school year, having
forits purpose the study of the
drama through reading and pres
pared papers together with the
performance of plays from time to
time “Sweet Lavender" is the
first play which the club has at
tempted, and the success ot the
presentation warrants its members
in the belief that their efforts have
crowned with a good measure or
success. The club has naiurally
experienced some dimculty in the
beginning at its work, but now that
the ﬁrst obstacles have been over-
come, it is to be hoped that it will
be able to accomplish all the pur-
poses which its toiinders had in
view, both this year and in years
to come. Dramatic clubs are im-
portant and ﬂourishing organiza-
tions in many colleges and univerr
siiies throughout the country, and
there is no reason why the same
should not be true of such a club
in Iowa College, where so much
interest in the drama has been
manitest during the last tewyears.
SCARLET & BLACK extends to the
Dramatic Club its congratulations
and best wishes for the future.
WE wisn to urge upon the track
mentheimportance oitakingwork
in the gymnasium. For years we
have complained about the poor
taciliiies tor preliminary track~
work, and congratulated ourselves
upon the success we have attained
without these advantages. Now
that we have a well equipped gyms
nasiuni and a competent ilistruce
tor, we should make the most of
otrhem. Every traclcman should
see the physical instructor at once
and take up systematic work un~
der him, and not only take up sys-
tematic work, but ‘begin training}
Training is no longer a hardship
at Grinnell. The training rules
are very mild. An athlete of only
ﬁve years ago would not know that
he was training, it under our pres.
ent system, Not only the track-
men, but every man in school
should talrc up some line or excre
cise and keep at it all the year.
We have a serious proposition he
tore us this year. There is but
one man in school who won :t
point at the last State Meet. Our
