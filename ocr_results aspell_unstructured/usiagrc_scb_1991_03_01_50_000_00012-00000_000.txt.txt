VICE'PRESIDENTIAL INTERVIEWS

McAdory cites broad
outlook as inﬂuence

Whatdoyoulhinkmakesynu
the best qualiﬁed candidate for
SGA VicerPresident?

Iwouldhaveto saythalcommtt-
ment to seeing that students’ views
are aired in such a way that they
will hold the most credence on this
campus with the administrators.
Because ultimately, we all realize
that the power is in the hands of the
peoplewith the money and who run
the school. And I believe the thing
I most want to
see having been
in SGA and obr
servmg what is
going on, the
thing I most
want to see is
thatsludentsget
achancetohave
a say. To have a
very important
say on what
goes on on Grinnell’s campus. Be-
cause ultimately even though we
are only on a fourycarcycle, we are
students,antllbclievcstudentshave
common interests over years. And
so I feel like the more I can do to
help students get their opinions
heard by the administration and be
acted upon by the administration. I
believe that's what makes me an
important candidate, besides my
experience in SGA.

What do you foresee as the
most important issues facing
SGA, and whal changes would
you initiate l'tyr SGA?

In terms of spee'iiics, I’m not
really surejust because we do have
a new President and from what I
can understand by talking to people

I feel things I’m
doing now are
enabling students’
views to be seen,
and that’s very
important.

in the past is that the President
really sets the tone of the school. I
mean, President Drake has made
this a wonderful environment for
students to be nurtured in and to be
able to get their views aired with a
lot of aven ties, you know. to talk to
the administrators. But you know
it‘s going to change. 1 don’t think
people know how much it's going
to change when Pamela Ferguson
finally gets into the swing ofthings
and looks around and sees things
that she might
Wlllll to change
or implement.
And there's
nothing wrong
with that be
cause change
and new ideas
are Wonderful.
But I see the
moslsigniticant
thing for stu-
dents is making surc the President
keeps things about the campus that
we feel are essential, and doesn’t
discard them in an effect to find her
niche.

What have you contributed to
the campus, and how do you feel
you have represented student in»
teresli in Ihat cunlrihuiion?

One ofthe things that I'm doing
right now which 1 guess ts a con-
crete thing that I‘ve contributed to
the campus as well as being Ade
ministrative Coordinator, is being
on the New Dorm Committee. And
I think this is going to be very
important in that housing is done in
the future at Grinnell in thalitis

McCarthy emphasizes committee
work, student communication

Whal do you think makes you
the best qualiﬁed candidate for
SGA Vice-president?

1 think cvcrybody's qualified to
nccrlain dcgrcc, butI think some of
the activities I’ve been involved in
at Grinnell College put me at the
top of the list. Basically my in-
volvcmcnt in Joint Board mectin gs
with my experience Wllll different
organizations on campus, which
basically stems from my being on
Finance Committee for two se-
mesters now, and my involvement
asPoIitical ActivtuesSupponFund
chair. 1 go to every Joint Board
meeting. I’ve been going to every
Joint Board meeting since second
scmcstcrfreshman year,whenlwas
senator for Gates, And I try and
speak up as often as Ican whenever
I feel there’s something that needs
to be done, or 1 have something
original to say or I wanted to see
something passed. Because I feel
that I represent a multifaceted
campus like Grinncll, there are so
many interests here, so many dif-
ferent ideologies, ideas, opinions.
It takes someone who is going to
listen to every one of them and then
express that to the faculty and ad
ministration as President of Acn-
demic Affairs and also represent
those ideas in theJoint Board meet-
ings. I think too often emphasis is
put on President of Academic Af-
fairs, and that is the greatest role
that the Vicchrcsident has. But I
also realize that in Joint Board
meetingslhePrcsident,whoisduly
elected head of SGA, who is sup
posed to represent the entire cam-
pus,isnotallowedto speakatJoint

Board because he or she has to
chair. In fact, if he or she wants to
speak on an issue he or she has to
come down rrorn the podium and
the VicerPrcsident has to take
charge. 1 see myself taking a more
active role in Joint Board maybe
than past Vice-Presidents have. I
haven‘t been around for many, but
the pastVicchresidcnt has. Speakr
ing up, saying something when 1
feel it needs to be said. Because as
I say the Vice-President is the only
campusrwidc elected official at the
Joint Board Meetings. As Vice-

Ifeel 1 conform a
rapport with any-
one. And that’s
most important
when dealing with
the administration.

President I hope I have a great
amount of dealings with the orga-
nizations alGrinneIl. Sothatl have
a good feel for the student body in
general and organizations and dllr
ferent clubs.

What do you foresee as the
greatest issues facing SGA, and
what changes would you initiate
for SGA?

The most important things that
face SGA right now 1 think are,I
dennttely know, a schism starting
to cut across the campus. Its small
now, but it brought out by many

differentthings that wenton during
the past month on campus, like
Disco Week and the speaking of
ZaahirMuhammad.There'sbeena
lot of hostility. Deb Koa asked that
maybeifthcy wereconcemod they
could sit down together and every-
one could say their piece. I think
that’s a good idea, because I think
there's a lot of hostility right now
on campus. No one really knows
what’sgoingonAndlthinkgroups
are going to have to sit down and
talk to each other because some
people's feelings are getting hurt;
some people feel threatened and,
that's got to be ironed out right
now. As far as academic concerns
incampusrightnow whichlwould
be dealing with primarily as Presi—
dent of Academic Affairs. The
faculty's initiating, possibly inilir
ating. a requirement that seniors
take a senior seminar outside their
major. I think that's a really im-
portant thing right now because its
long as I've been here Grinnell has
been, you've had a choice, you
didn‘t really have to do anything.
AndI fool thatifl as Vicc»President
can get involved in that process as
early as possible in the planning
stages and have student input into .
the planning stages and have rep
resentation of the entire campus
during that period, then we'll have
stronger representation when the
final outcome is delivered, and
that’s important. The 3»2 program
isstillanimportantissue,especially
wall the budget cuts that the trust»
ees have enforced to put in acut
of 1.5 million dollars because

Alexander plans academic discipline,
brings “new perspective”

What do you believe makes
you the best candidate for SGA
Vice-President?

I believe that I'm the best quali-
fled candidate for SGA Vicar
Presidentbecausel’m open minded
and I feel as Ihough I know a lot of
different people and a lot of diner.
ent points of View, I give till those
points of view tin equal amount of
respect. And I want to incorporate
all these points of view in any ac-
tion thatl take. Sorcally I'm rcprCr
sentative. I also feel I’m open to
new ideas and willing to try some»
thing different, willing to be a little
bit innovative.

What do you foresee as the
most important issues facing
SGA, and what changes would
you initiate for SGA?

For me, the most important is-
sue for the next year is...l want to
start working to start on an Ethnic
Studies Dcpartment,because I drink
that right now there's a lot of inter-

est in it, but I want to find outmorc
about how students at Grinnell feel
about it. I also want to find out
abouthow faculty feel about it. And
whether or not...AntI what ideas
they have for such a department. I
feel that it's something that will
take a lot of time but somebody

I think that I can
provide a diﬂerent
perspective, a
perspective of
diﬁerent types of
students.

needs to start it, to startworklngon
it. It will be helpful to students
because I think it will give them a
new perspective. It will give them a
wider variety ofcourscs, and it will
give them a new perspective on
differentdisciplincs. Alsol thinkit
willbegood forGrinnellbccauseil
will help in their recruitment of

ethnic minority students because it
Will be an added incentive for Stu-
dents to come here, And that's the
issue that I want to work on the
mosl,andl wantto haveitnotasthe

offteebut as an issue that is worked
on mroughout the year.

Whatliave you contributed to
the campus, and how do you feel
you have represented student in-
terests in that contribution?

I served on Judicial Council for
two years and I represented student
interests in terms of trying to main»
tain the residential life policies and
helping With the self»govemance,
the self-govemance thatwc haveat
Grinnell, I‘ve been a Student ddvir

I tried to bring my floor closer to

upperclass students on that floor
andl worked to bring them to
