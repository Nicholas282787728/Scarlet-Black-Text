Steiner Talks On
Duty of College
Man To the World

“College men must revolt,” said or
Steiner in his Y. M. C. A. talk Thule
day. They have been lcddoo much by
Aolder men and if the world is to be
keptlrom going to the dogs the young
,men must take the responsibilityﬂlb-
‘bn their shoulders. The war which
put the world in the condition it is
today was not declared by the young
men who fought. It was star‘e'l 11y ,
‘Lhe gray heads, bald beads, o'nd soft
heads.” if it had been left to young
men to decide in the ﬁrst place they
would ave chosen the constructive
work of peace rather than the destruc—
tive work of war. The young men of
Itoday must see that they have the
responsibility, form new standards of
Eliﬁng and endure anything even
death, for those standards We, ibe
college men are letting things slide,
'nuw. We must revolt and bring the
world out of the mess into which It
has been plunged.
