Dear Editor,

The article concerning the Boise Casud: Colpomtion,1lrhough
obviously well—researehed, eould have been written in a more objec-
tive manner. The arriele on several oeeasions misquores mcmbers of
Free rhe Planet, making rhem look less than eredihle or even foolish.
The assertions that Free the Planet hlindly aeeepts info at faee value
is also insulting. we have researehed allegations against Boise Cas-
eade in almost every professional sphere and will not stop until we
have enough to eonvinee administration and the student body that
Boise is indeed s eorporarioa whose praetiees undermine the values
and morals on whieh this campus is run.The artiele also quotes Mike
Moser on several oeoisions desetihing how Boise in {aet aids in the
growth and management of Terese. There is no doubt thst Boise
promotes itselrwith an environmentally friendly image and eertainly
Boise has made some efforts to reinforee this. However, despite these
effoto in forest management, the eorpotarion has heen linked to
several recent unethical logging operations ineluding the “plank
tion ofrhe Greer Bear Bainforest.

As an aetive memhet of the Sustainable Forest Initiative (Sfllr
Boise ssn dam to adhere to environmental protoeols and regula»
rions while still eommitting heinous erimes agaiasr the environment
and humanity due to the ahsenoe of many labor and environmental
regulations. The SFI also has little presenee abroad, anlike its eoun.

less effeerive, aeeording ro Boise's 2000 annual report), thus enabling
Boise to take advantage offoreign markers with minimal regulations

SH, sripulates provisions for the protestion ofold-growth, the wel.
fare ofemployees and the lives of indigenous eommuniries. Given
the minimal presence ofthe SF] overseas and Boises history ofviolae
tiens here in the u,s., Boise has been shifting its fetus to internae

tional markets in recent years, resulting in layoffs and foreed retiree
ments for thousands ofAmeriean employees and the exploitation of
rare and diverse eeosystei-as ahroad. Two of these attempted opera.
tions have failed reeently ineludiag'the ineidents in Guerrero, MEchOt

Boise has terminated afterseveral lawsuits and loeal allegations eon.

stroy ecosystems but the lives and even etilture ofmany native people.
It is dear to us that we ean not let Boise caseade remain affiliated
with Grinncll and we will not sit haek and toleote atraelts to our
eredihility and to our goals, Until we sever all ries with Boise casende
the ideals ofGrinncll and every person here will remain tainted and
until then Grinnell College ean he sure that Free The Planet and
