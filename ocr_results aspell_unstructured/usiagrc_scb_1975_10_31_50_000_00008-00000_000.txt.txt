advantageofthe wind when We had
it and didn‘t play well going

Pfltsch added that, “Our kids
played hard and worked hard. We
just had a letrup at the end of the

The Grinnell Scarlet and Black, October 31,1975-vl1e 8

Gridders split”,
look to even up

by Tom Arenherg

To make an understatement, the
Grinnell football record seems to
be following a sort of pattern. Since
opening day, Ihe Pioneers have
kept to the trend of losing one week
and then winning the next. The
pattern continued as the team,
after losing to Cornell, beat Beloit
and lhen lost to Ripon in two home
games over break. Their record is
now 3-4.

Led by the passing combination
of Paul Crane to Paul Delaney and
with the help of nine Beloit tur'
novers, Grinnell won easily, 31.14,
two Saturdays ago. Last week,
Ripon capitalized on two Pioneer
errors late in the game to win, 277
18.

Grinnell Head Coach Edd
Bowers said he does not think there
is a hidden pyschological factor
causing the up and down pattern.
“That's just the way things have
worked out," he said. “Several
games could easily have gone the
other way."

Ripon rally wins

The Ripon game was probably
one of them. Grinnell led, 18-14,
late in lhe fourth quarter. but
Crane, under a heavy rush, threw
an interception inside his own
territory. The Redmen then moved
downfield and ran the ball in from
one-yard out. Bowers said, “I think
Paul made a mistake. He should
have taken the loss instead of
throwing the ball,” Later in the
quarter, the Pioneers fumbled the
ball away inside their own 20 yard-
line and Ripon scored on another
oneryard run to guarantee the
victory.

Ripon scored first on a short run
that was setup by a Pioneer
fumble oi the opening kickoff.
Grinnell took the lead when
fullback Tom Goetz completed a
long drive of mostly running by
rushing in from one yard out and
then catching a tworpoint pass
from kickholder Craig zippe.
Goetz finished with 98 yards
rushing,

The Redmen regained the lead
on another short touchdown carry
before Pioneer Steve Bolcsta
kicked a 37»yard field goal to cut
the margin. Grinnell went ahead,
15.14, early in the fourth quarter
when Crane scored on a one-yard
run, capping an aoyard drive that
took up most of the third quarter

BeSlde the two late turnovers,
Grinnell's biggest headache was
Ripon runningback Joe Majeski.
Majeski, who was injured in the
Grinnell game last year, scored all
four Redmen touchdowns and with
the help of superb blocking,
recorded lnost of Ripon’s 253
rushing yards, Bowers said he
thought last year’s injury to
Majeski was an extra incentive for
the runner to do well.

First home loss

The loss was Grinnell’s first ever
on Rosenbloom Field, after three
Wins. The third home Victory had
come one week earlier against
Beloit. Tlle Ploneers had all

game: Beloit. The Buccaneers
were penalized for 122 yards, threw

four interceptions, and fumbled
seven times, four of which Grinnill
recovered '

The Pioneer's tough defensive

position. The defense also Stopped
the run well and shut off the pass
until late in the game, when the
victory was guaranteed in Gr‘

in a familiar scene, Crane hit

the Pioneers first points. Grinnell
scored three touchdowns in the
Second quarter, all of which were
keyed by defensive plays, Bolesta
scored on a Zoryard interception
return and Goetz ran in from three
yards out after defensive end By;
Grant recovered a fumble on the

Delaney sets record

Delaney caught seven passes for
147 yards, setting a school record
for most receiving yardage in one
game, l-lis twelve points moved
him into first place in conference
scoring, a spot he still holds
although Majeski's performance
