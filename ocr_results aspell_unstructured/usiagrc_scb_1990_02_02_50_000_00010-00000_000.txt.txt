these concerns. She also said
that investment in comparitively
less proﬁtable enterprises such as

health and education is on tlte
rise.

The World Bank works with
about 170 billion dollars This
money comes from the 152
member countries.

' The six countries with the
largest stakes in the World Bank
make up a board of “executive
directors." These representatives
meet twice weekly to decide

where, as Handwerger put it, the
“Banker to the World" will make
investments toward the economic
development of tlte world.

The United States is the
World Bank’s largest shareholder.
holding roughly 25% of the
shares. Japan is second with
about 15%. The United
Kingdom, France, Germany, and
Saudi Arabia round out the
executive board.

Headquartered in Washington,
D.C,, The World Bank employs
six thousand people. Americans
make up about 20 percent of the
workforce Ten percent of World
Bank employees are female,
though, according to Handwerger,
few women hold high
management positions. _

Later, in a private interview,
l-Iandswergcr was asked if. as
coordinator for policy, planmng,
and research, she takes any
responsibility for the discrepency
between male and female

employment at the bank.
Handwerger accepted some
responsibility. She explained
that, “[Womcn] get lip service
from top male people,“ and noted
that since the World Bank is not
a strictly American institution,
sexual discrimination laws do not
'apply to it.

I-landwerger was also
questioned about a so-called
“gentleman's agreement" that
she had discussed in her talk.
According to this unwritten
agreement, the head of the World
Bank would always be a Northern
European, while the head of the
the International Monetary Fund,
a sister organization with more
specialized duties, would be a
North American. Because Japan
is the second largest investor in
both outfits, this agreement
seemed somewhat discriminatory,
and out of place in an
organization founded on altruistic
principles. Handwerger was
frank. agreeing that this
unspoken agreement was unfair
and undermined fair agreements in
the written charter of the bank.

She went on to point out that
Robcrt McNamara, a former
World Bank chairperson, had
made efforts to change the
situation. The Secretary of
Defense under Kennedy,
McNamara was asked to head the
World Bank by Lyndon Johnson
because he was vocal in his
opposition of the Vietnam War.
Handwcrger stated that “he knew
[reforms] would not come about."

Kent: Form Committee to Detect Bias'

posal will involve the formation
of a new committee, “The
President's Committee on
Ideological Equity in
Instruction." This committee
will be composed mostly of
students, with a few faculty
representatives. The purpose of
this committee is to evaluate
each class in terms of
ideological instruction, to
determine if there is a bias
present, and to make
recommendations to both the
deparunent and to the trustees as
to by what means the bias may
be remedied. The purpose of

this committee is NOT to
remove ideology from the
classroom. but quite the
opposite. The purpose of the
committee is to insure that
students have access to a wide
variety of ideologies, so that
they might decide for
themselves which ideology is
most consistent with their view
of the world.

The committee might also
make recommendations
regarding convocation topics.
and other campus speakers.

The purpose of this
prospective committee is not to
silence the espousal of liberal
ideology in the classroom, but

rather to end the unofficial
silencing of dissenting
ideologies. In addition, the
committee has only the power
to make recommendations, and
to publish recommendations and
findings. At the very least,
students will be forewarned that
the class they are considering
has been identiﬁed as biasedana
that the professor has declined to
act on the recommendations of
the committee. At best, the
Grinnell experience will be
broadened immensely and
students will graduate with an
understanding not only of liberal
collegiate America, but of the
whole spectrum of ideologies.

Although both women hztd
strong feelings about the war in
Azerbaijan, they were less
opinionated about the radical
changes in Eastern Europe.
Tanya likened the Azerbaijanian
civil war in the Soviet Union to
a conflict within one of our
states. and pointed out that
problems within a state would
affect the U.S. much more than
a conﬂict far from home. l-lence,

troubles in Azerbaijan than the

As the topic shifted from
world events to more concrete
results of reforms within the
U.S.S.R., the women became
more animated. They spoke of
Komsomol, the Youth
Communist League to which
they both belong. Founded in
1918, the purpose of the
organization is to teach values of
Communist society. Tanya
draws on the group as a clear
exampleof how Soviet rule has
changed. “You used to have to

to Julia, "Colleges would refuse
