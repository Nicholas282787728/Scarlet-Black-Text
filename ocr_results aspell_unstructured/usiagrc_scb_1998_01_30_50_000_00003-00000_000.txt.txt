He is the type of person you can't
miss. He is mysterious and clever,
like something out of a 007 movie.
His unique clolhes would not achieve
the same magnetic cffecl if worn by
another. He is Matt Ryan, KDIC's
new Music Director, You can catch
Matt on the
air every
Tuesday af-
ternoon from
4:00pm »
6:00pm with
“In Memory

and ”The
TopTwenty."

K . N . :
What is _
your job at
the station?

M a t t :
Right now, I
am Music Di-
rector, which
was the posie
tion that
K e v i n
McGoldrick
had, but he
went [0 Scots
land this see
meslci’, So I
got bumped up. (Matt smiles with
satisfaction.)

K.N.: What are the duties of
Music Director?

Man: He is the guy who usually
takes in all the mail. His main job is
to talk with the record labels, usu-
ally the major labels and mayor pro-
motion agencies. They are basically
sending you new music to play on
the air and they’re trying to keep
track of whether or not it is being
played by the Dis and where you are
charting it on your“Top 30" list. You
are kind of like the head voice for
the station.

(Malt suddenly looks uncomfort-
able, like he thinks that he has taken
too much credit.)

Matt: There are also other For-
mat Directors, who do more specific
genres, like RPM bands and stuff,

K.N.: So, part oi your job is to
get the new music {or free.

Matt: Yeah. Labels and promo
tional agencies send you stuff for
free, in hopes that you will play it, It
you don‘tplay it or report it, they will
stop sending you stuff. So, it works

Matt: The first hour is “In

second hour is “The Top 20" show.

K.N.: So, basically, you have a
two hour slot split into two differ-
ent shows.

Matt: The first hour is my regue
lal‘ show, which r‘did last semester,
and in thesecond hourr will just play
the Top 20 albums we have. We hope
that we can get a better idea of what
we are recording. It is kind of like
Casey Casein, but for college. Most
every other college does a show like
that.

K.N.: And with “In Memory or
Radio Raheem,” what kind of
music do you pla'y?‘

Matt: It isjusl rock... Rockn Roll,

Punk. Crazy stuff.
K.N.: Well, it’s a crazy campus.
Matt: Yeah, kind of.
(We both laugh.)
Matt: What I play is what I love.
K.N.: Last semester there

casted, due to the broken phone

musical finesse and stunning vir-
tuoso display, the Prague Chamber
Orchestra promises to be a rare mu»
siczll treat for the studenls ofGr'rnnell.

Technically. the words ‘Chamber
Orchestra' seem to imply an inlimalc
ensemble of approximately 4-5
people. However, the Praglle Charli-

amusing.

0n the Waterfront

Directed by Elia Kazan. Slarring
Marlon Brando, Karl Mulden, and a
bunch ofold has-beans from the 505.

I didn't get to see this one, but it
won a whole slew of Oscars in 1954,
so how bad can it be? It stars Brando
as Terry Malloy, who wants to be a
prize—ﬁghter while working the clock
for some criminal union boss (aren't
they all?) named Johnny Friendly. I-lc
witnesses a foul murder by Johnny‘s
boys, and is torn between love (for
the dead man's sister) and the fear
ofhaving his head used as a toilet by
the city’s crime element. The sister
introduces him to some sort ol'priesi,
who tries to make him testify, and
the hijrnks begin from there,

Hamlet 0 Q Q 9

Written and adapted by Kenneth
Branagh. Starring Branagh. Katc
Winslcl, Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi

it you have an extra 4 hours 2
minutes, see this movie. You all
know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet’s
uncle kills his father, Hamlet spends
the rest oithc play figuring out what
to do about [he SIlualIon. In the end,
he ends up leaving Denmark and
goes to McDonald's for a couple of
shakes.

The setting is updalcd a hit to lhc
19th century This decision probably
angers all you Shakespeare purists
out there, but il gives the movie an
excuse for extreme l‘dVlSlIIICSs, and
H delivers.

This movie is easily the most
spectacular combination of cinema»
tography with set and costume de-
sign ever, This movie pOSIlIVcly
leaps from the screen and grabs you
by the lupcls with incredible color
and vibrancy. The first scene inside
tllc Castle should induce til Icasl 4
orgasms. rinoi, demand your money
back.

Besides this fact, lhc acting is all
iiraund really good. Enough is siidly
Justﬂ little bilolforthis movie would

the shameless cameos by people such

as Robin Williams, Jack Lelnrnon,
