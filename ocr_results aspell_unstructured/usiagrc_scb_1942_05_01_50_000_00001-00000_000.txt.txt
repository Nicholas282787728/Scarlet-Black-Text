Year's Last Concert Sunday

Program to Feature
' Both Classical and
Light Music

The Grinnell college band will
present its last concert of the
year Sunday at 4:30 [L m. in
Herrick chapel, according to
Kenneth D, Simmons, director,

The first first half or the
program will be made up of mu-
sic of a lighter type than has
been played at previous concerts,
he stated. It will consist of tho
Overture to "The New Moon,"
“ Don Quixote Suite,” and "Scones
from the Sierras.”

The program for the last halt

last concert because of inclcment
weather, and who were unable to
hear the band in its January ap-

pearance arc urgccl to attend,”

in the dorm dining room. No
such action has been taken in

the quail as yet, Miss smith
said: but with a generally smalls
cr amount of food used in the
quadrangle such limitation may
not be required.

All technicalities of the ration
books have not been worked out
with college authorities, G, Gui»
don Ellis, men's counselor, said
yesterday afternoon after a pre-
liminary meeting With Hawk.

Whether the sugar stamps in
student's ration books will have
to be removed every week and
turned in to rationing authorities
is not sure, Ellis said. The college
now has on hand a sufficient
sugar supply to last until June
under the new limitations.

If other stamps in the book are

later designated for other commo-
(lilies than food, a new plan may
have to be worked out to allow
students to retain their books
next year in order to purchase
clothing and other materials while
a resident in Grinnell.

When students return home
in June, their books will be
given them for use there, El~
lis added. According to Hawk,
all subsequent books which
may later be required must
be issued from the commun—
ity in which the first is ob-
tained. If such books are is-
sued Llurilig the summer, the
applications of Grinnell stu—
dents will be transfered to
