You‘ve heard about the ARI-l renova-
tions, haven’t you? ll not. for Shame. you
haven't been reading your SGA Notes.
Anyway. supposedly they should start next
school year and be done by 1990. and while
ARH is incapacitated. classes will be held
in other buildings. dorm lounges. etc.

But no one has said exactly what it is
they will be doing to ARH that is taking so
much time and money.

Well. iolks. you read it first in the Scarlet
Letter 7 the ARH is becoming first dorm
ever. anywhere, lor professors.

i know it seems ludicrous. but think
about it [or a minute. The professors.
especially those ivith iamilies. won’t have
to pay outrageous housing payments for a
house in town. They can stay in touch with
events on campus — as a matter of fact.
they can't avoid them if they tried! They
won’t have to cook 7 imagine sitting next
to your biology professor at Quad' or
Cowles the dayaftera test. It will be ALOT
easier to get help in a class if you need it.

What changes will be made in ARH to
make it into suitable living quarters?
First. all those drafty windows will be
replaced completely. Elevators will have
to be installed. Some of the professors
have young children. and I can't speak for

but reliable sources indicate the training
building will be equipped with shooting
galleries, weight rooms. Air Force F16
ﬂight simulators. and reference library
supplied with Spanish traniations oi the
Federalist Papers, the U.S. Constitution.
the Bible. and Soldier oi Fortune.
magazine.

Grinnell College was chosen by the u.
government because it lit the r
quirements issued by the government for
training camp: isolation from any known
center of civilization.

them but lithink that those Stairs would be
deadly for little kids to navigate, They're
too slipperyl Better to put in elevators and
have the kids go up and down in them all
day, Walls between the classrooms are gor-
ing to be knocked down to make apart-
ments. Three- and four-room apartments
will be available 7 one room for a living
room. one for a kitchen and bathroom. and
one or two for bedrooms. depending on the
amount oi people in the family oi course.
this will all necessitate completely new
electrical. heating. cooling. water and
plumbing systems. at a hefty cost.

The prolessors who currently have of-
{ices in ARH will be moved to other
buildings, dorm lounges. etc. and those
rooms will be used for storage. With
children on the campus full-time. B and G
has decided to build a playgournd. it will
be directly in front of ARH. lacing in
towards the campus. and it will contain
swings. monkey bars. teeter-letters and all
that good stuff Who are weal Grinnell Col-
lege to deprive a child or the opportunity
lor educational outdoor play? Besides. it
could be a useiul resource for the educa
tion classes.

Hey. students of Grinnell. look at it this
way » in two years. it‘ll be one heck oi a
housewarming! l 2 ll
