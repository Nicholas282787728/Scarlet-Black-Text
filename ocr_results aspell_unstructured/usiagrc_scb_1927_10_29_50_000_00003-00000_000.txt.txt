\Vith the speedball schedule narrow-

race seems to be between the teams
representing Kelly Stables and Dibble
hall. ‘The Stable team has swept

through all of its games, and will meetl

a. fairly easy team ill Building Four
belorc they tackle the Court House
aggregation in the last seine of the
season.

The Dibble outﬁt has likewise won
all its games, and in doing this has
set a new record ior high scoring. The
judicial team deieated Building Four
by the highest score ever made in a
speedball game in Grinuell when they
Won in a wall: by a 34—11 margin, with
practically every member oi the team
scoring, By turning back the Smith
hall‘team by a 20-5 score on Tuesday,
the Dibbiites established themselves as
one oi the outstanding teams, and is
generally picked to win the series.
Kelly Stables and Dibble should meet
in the dual and deciding some in two

their opposition next week, Dibble
