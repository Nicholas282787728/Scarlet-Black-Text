Next Question...

Misllllderstandings between Gl'ilinell students and their
college president are not ilncomnlolL This afternoon, there-
'lfcre, the editorial board and President Samuel N. Stevens
(Ll-operated to present the current rumors and facts about
We administration’s plans for the next year in all informal
scs 'on with the Friars and interested students in Yoilnker
lounge.

If need be, President Stevens has agreed to have an
all-college convocation tol discuss matters further at some
later date. Here are some of the questions students seem to
lie woiTying about: .

‘ Wllat is the expected enrollment for next year? Be—
cause draft quotas are beilig increased andfmay even in-
clude 18 and one-half year olds, the enrollment will prob-
ably remain at 850-825 students The expected enrollment
for the next few years is hard to predict, however, because
o”'the possibility of UMT andlo'r all out war. The enroll-
ment for women correspondingly will drop or rise.

Why the discontinuation of linen service and health in-
surance? The college will save $20,000 by having students
”tarnish their own linens. Health insurance will be available,
but optional. While student fees will remain the same, the
money formerly used in these areas will be applied to tili-
oiiion expenses.

Is the teaching staff at Grinnell going to be cut? The
staff will be cut. The actual decrease in number of faculty
employed by the college will be slight however, for of the
1: professors who are leaving next year, foilr will be on
temporary leaves for further study, foilr will be replaced be—
cause of retirement or other reasons and only the sociology,
pl:ycholqu,\ biology, music, and possibly modern language
departments will lose staff members To take care of this
situation some professors will be teaching in two depart.
ments—a move made possible by the addition of 3 hour
courses to the curriculum.

In other words, if the facts President Stevens has
’ven us are true, there will be no drastic changes handed
wn by the president‘s office. We therefore urge students,
if.there is anything which looks frightening about plans
for Grinnell 1953-54, to make an appointment to talk with
the president of their college, rather than to rely on curv
rent rumor.

l A glance at student leadership
on the campus would seem’ to
place all those leadership groups
on campus called "boards" on
south campus—such as League

boards. ,But there- is- one very
important leadership board on
campus that is not dominated by
(the females.

This board the Student
Board of hell on, is probably
one of the best representative
groups on campus because it
always sirives to have men
hers irom each class on it
(with the exceptiowoi fresh»
men), and irom cnch oi the
three religious groups, Catho-
lic, Protestant and Jewish.

This board is comparatively
young at Grinnell as it was

It‘s been a long time since I

there have been complaints.
I'd be the last one ln.the world

If that wasn’t'enough south
Korean veteran
Herb Lancaster to represent it
on the C of HP, Lancaster is
one more administration‘hater
and lie was probably elected for
tl‘lnt,reason, if for any reason
at all.

Bob Winter was the
choice in south Younker‘s sis-
ter-hall. He and the housema-
ther should make a charming
couple at dinner. The c of HP
has long neededla meterolog‘ist
and Tony Cordaro says that Big
Bob has built-in Sturm warning.

Smith picked Milton Meigs and
1 can't think of a better pick,
They always‘ get those quiet
guys in 'Smith (it you forget
Jim Martin. and Rudy Miller)
who make such perfect presi<
dents.
