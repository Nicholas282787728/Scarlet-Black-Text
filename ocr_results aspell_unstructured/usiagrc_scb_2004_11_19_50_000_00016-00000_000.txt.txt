Grinnell tries to keep its playoff streak alive with
a revamped roster and its famous full court press

Men’s basketball coach David Arse-
nenult had a good idea what was con-r
ing, but he also knows that, even now,
there’s no telling how the 2004-2005
season will unfold.

“For the last three years,I have had
a reasonable idea of what was going
to transpire in the upcoming season,”
he said. “[But t]his year any predic»
rion would be pure conjecture. I think
we are deep but, as yet, untested under
ﬁre. How quickly some of out ﬁrst-
years can come up to
speed and how our
upperclassmen react
to their new roles
will determine how
quickly we come out
of the shoot."

Gtinnell, which
opens its 2004-2005
campaign tonight
against St. Ambrose
University in the
Mount Mercy Tournament in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, graduated one or the
greatest senior classes in team history
lastyear.lt included Steve Wood‘04, the
school’s all—time leading scorer; Steve
Nordlund ‘04, who onee averaged sbt
three—pointers a game for an entire seas
son; Nick Malinowski ‘04, who scored
over 1000 points for his career despite
missing nearly a full season with injury;
role and rebounding specialist Patrick
Choquette‘Oli; and Ken Heiser ‘04, one
of the team’s be‘st slashing scorers and
distributors.

Many things ehnnged in the off-
season, but one thing that will remain
constant is Arscncault's manic bombse
away full~court press, which has earried
the Pioneers to three MWC titles in the
last nine years, four straight playoffap-
pearanees and, in rho last two years, he
tional publicity compliments of ESPN.

But even this year the offensive attack‘

will be somewhat different.
“We’re a lot more team-oriented
this season," said corcaptain Matt

“The new guys aren’t
filling the roles that
were left, they’ve been
creating new roles.
They changed the sys-
tem to fit them.”

iMatt Brown '05

Brown ‘05. “Last year we had guys to
lean on, like Wood and Nordlund. We
could give them the ball and know we’d
be okay. We don‘t have that this year,
but we can have a lot more team play,
so it will even itself out,"

“were looking to get otrense from
a lot of places," added co-captain Cole
Robertson ‘05. “Hopefully that will be
one of our weapons. Teams won’t be
able to key on one guy.”

True to the system, these Pioneers
look to run at least 15 deep off the
bench with their usur
a1 mass-substitution
system. The number
of new names among
those 15 hasn’t pre
vented Gtinnell from
meshing in practice.

"Practice has been
good," said cowapr
tain Eric Walsh ‘05.
“we've had rough
spots due to the in-
corporation or younger players. We've
got four firstsyears who will have an
impact, and the sophomore class must
step up. We’ve kind of been riding last
year's seniors for three years now, so jus
niors and seniors will have to step up
into bigger roles."

"We'relookingprettygnod,"snid Rob-
ertson.“We’ve got a lot of young guys, so
there's a bit or a learning curve, but we've
had ﬂashes that look really good."

Of course, Grinnell fans won’t get to
see them until January Grinnell opens
with 13 consecutive road games (the
closest at a neutral site in Marshall
town) while Darby Gym is completed,
not exactly the most ideal schedule for
a team with a lot ofrookies in the mix.

“The schedule doesn’t help," said
Walsh. “The young guys will have to
learn to play strong on the road.”

“It’s always tough to play on the
road, and that many games in a row will
make it difficult," said Robertson. “We

Letting it ﬂy

Year three in the Hamilton era calls for more 35

BY Joe GENI

When the Grinnell women‘s basketball team u“,
veils its new uptempo attack tonight at the Elmhurst
College Tournament in Elmhurst, Ill., it will also un-
veil a ream uniquely suired to the style or play For
starters, there’s the whole height thing.

“The reason [behind the new system] is, we’re not
very t:l.l,”said head eoaeh Andy Hamilton ofhis team,
on which the average height is about S-7.“So the idea
behind the uptempo style ofplay is to try to rule the
oppositions post players and make them work hard
for a full 94 feet on every possession, and hopefully
we'll be able to tire them out by doing that."

For each of the last two seasons, the Pioneers had
a power post player (0 ride down low, and lost season
they rode all the way to their first trip to the playoffs
in n decade. But after bidding farewell to Marie Ops
sahl-Lister ‘03 and Tai Duncan ‘04 in successive years,
Hamilton was left wirh a ream that had zero play-
ers over six feet and was instead blessed with a slew
of guards and small forwards who can all shoot the
three-ball.The resulting full-court,nptempo attack is
a natural fit for this team’s Lineup.

“Personnelswise, we lost two starters; one domi—
nant post player [Duncan] and a solid point guard
[Acrivi Cotomelas ‘04]," said Hamilton. “We did not
replace the post player, but we filled our point guard
position"

The Pioneers will return slashing seorers Lindsay
Peter '05 and Katy Bowen ‘05 and long-tnnge spe-
cialist Anna Veit ‘05 from last year’s starting lineup,
along with a capable second unit. The class of 2008
gave Grinnell a pair of point guards to go with three
shooters and a small forward “So we have six short
firstsyears,” said Hamilton, “but they can score."
