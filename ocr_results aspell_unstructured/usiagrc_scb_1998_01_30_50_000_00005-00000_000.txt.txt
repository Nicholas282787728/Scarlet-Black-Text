patch. Are you planning on tak-
. ing more calls, now that it is ﬁxed?
Matt: I would loveto take calls. I
‘ don’t know now many people listen
i to my show. Ithink I had a few lis-
’ teners last semester. I know a lot of
townies listen and some scary
‘ people.
A K.N.: How do you feel about
> those scary people?
Matt: Well,.,they scare me. I am
. glad that they are listening, butl wish
A they wouldn’t call so much. [do hope
_ that we can get more people listen»
' mg, through events, like bringing in
* bands from out of state, campus band
‘ shows, and music give aways...the
usual stuff. In the end, it all comes
' down to whether they like the music
A or not.
ﬂ KN; What is your goal for your
shows?
‘ Matt: For my personal show. my
ngoal is just to let people listen to
. music that they don’t know about,
What I have found is that I listen to
‘ music that most people don‘t know

about, but ifthey listen they will like
it. With my “Top 20” show, hopefully
I can give people a chance to hear
what is new and what has just come
out. something that is not on a major
label. Like if you are into the new
Sublime album, which you will hear
no matter what anyway, instead you
might hear the new Highbombers
album, which is a great album, but
you aren’t going to hear it on alter-
native rock radio. So, you can hear
non»mainstteam popular new stuff.

K.N.: And what about your
goals for the station in the future?

Matt: One is to get more listene
ers and try to interact with the stue
dents, We should try to build... (Matt
hesitates) it sounds cheesy, but to
build a musical community on cam-
pus. People could support shows. go
to concerts and listen to the station.
do what they can. Most everyone
likes some type ofmusic. We should
try to get them to do something with
it. I hope that we can help.

works in the repertoire." The concert
