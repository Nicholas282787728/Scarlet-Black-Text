By falling to convert chances into
points, Limgan’s B team tasted de-
feat for the first time this season
when Kelly tables set them back
with B. 17-11 score. last Saturday af-
ternoon in the final round of inter-
dorm basketball, While this en-
counter had no bearing on Langan's
premier position in the tournament
it did spoid any hopes they had en—
joyed of turning in a perfect record
of Victories. Kelly Stables advanced
into 3 triple tie for third place by
winning this game from Langan.
Langan, smarting under the defeat
of her B team came back in the A
game to run circles around the boys
from Three, taking them into camp
35-7.

Dibble and Clark split their games,
Dibble taking the a game 10—9, and
Clark annexing the B affair 14—12.
The B game was an over-time at-

Cornell Debate
is Held Monday

Grinnell is Represented by
Alexander, Perry,

and Henson.

Centering their attention on the
question as to whether or not arms
mean war, Cornell college debaters of
Mount Vernon argued against the
Grinneii college debate team .in a
non decision affair in the clubroom
of Langan hall Monday evening upon
the subject of disarmament. The
visitors upheld the affirmative case
and Grinneli maintained the nega
tive.

The question was “Resolved: that
the nations of the world should adopt

]a policy of complete disarmament, ex-

cepting such forces as are necessary
for police protection.” Messrs, Felt.
Ford and Ellis spoke for Cornell, and
Alexander, Perry and Henson reprer
sented Grinnell.

The affirmative case. as built by

the Cornell team, contained the be»
liefs that arms mean war; that disc
|armament means less taxes and over
head, more production, buying power
and demand, and higher wages, and
that to have international sc‘curity it
takes the head instead of the first
and statesmanship rather than re-
pression. Gn‘rmell’s negative arguers
)put forth that the inherent causes of
war are not arms that the destruc-
ltion of arms does not make war im-
possible, and that the forcing of na»
tions to give up their sovereignty is
impossible.

Grinnell debated that instead of
arms causing war, they were the in-
herent causes of economic, social and
‘political trouble.

 

Constructive speeches were eight
minutes in length, and the rebtlttals,
one from each team, were seven
minutes in duration. Mr. Alexander-
gave the rebuttal for Grinnell, and
Mr. Ellis spoke the concluding words
for Cornell. Francis Hawk acted as
chairman of the affair.

Grinnell‘s affirmative dehaiers up
on the disarmament question argued
against Cornell College's negative
trio at Mount Vernon the same evo—
ning. Crinnell was represented by
Harley stipp, Richard Sneed and
Drennan Miller.
