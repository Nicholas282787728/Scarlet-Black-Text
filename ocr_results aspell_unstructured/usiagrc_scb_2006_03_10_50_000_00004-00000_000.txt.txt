New head librarian Fyffe brings
passion and love of the prairie

av SARAH MIRK

Richard Fyire said he became a librarian almost by
accident, He emerged from University of Connectir
cur with a degree in philosophy and no clear career
path. The one thing he knew was that he wanted “to
be in an academic environment where scholars and
learning mattered." Now, 20 years later, he will enter
Grinnell's ivory tower as the newly hired Librarian of
the College.

This is a potentially long-term appointment that
comes on the brinkofbig changes for Burling Library:
the new science library addition, a planned massive
expansion of the existing Burling building and the
Library’s swiftly changing electronic offerings will all
be passed into Fyffe’s hands this Augusr. Members
of the search committee that chose

e from over 40 candidates were
looking for a Librarian of the Cole
lege who would be a strong leader
for the library through its future
transformations and still keep an
ear out for student concerns.

The Librarian of the College is
the chiefadministrator ofBurling.
He or she oversees the budget, sets
library policy and represents the
library to the administration and outside media.Thc
current Librarian of the College, Christopher McKee,
has held his position since 1972. While most Glinnell
students probably think more about the library‘s arr
chitecture and collection than the decisionrmaking
that goes into choosing its staff, McKee maintains
that "the most important resource of this library is
its people.”

McKee will enter scnior faculty status at the end
of this semester. With this people centered philosophy
in mind, the hunt for a head librarian to fill McKec's
office began in earnest last July. Grinnell placed a full-
page advertisement in the C/nmlir/c Wigwam/re
rim: and sent out letters to every library school in the
nation announcing the position. The search commit-
tee was headed byJim Swurtz. vice president ofAcae
tlemic Affairs, and included a mix of students, faculty
and library staff.

Christopher McKee

According to Associate Librarian Gail Bonath,
The school did not hire from within because no one
applied for the position. “We wanted someone with
fresh ideas and energy," Bonath said. “I’ve been at
Grinnell for so years. I wanted someone who had
been somewhere else and I wanted someone who
would challenge us a little."

Assessment sheets, photocopied resumes and
spreadsheet calendars of rounds of interviews and
luncheons now fill three large, blue folders in Bonath’s
office in Hurling. Bonath said the library was search-
ing for someone with good leadership qualities who
was active in a scholarly field and had experience with
a small liberal arts college environment.

Fyffe comes to Grinnell not from a small peer in-
stitution but from the position of
assistant dean in the library of the
University of Kansas at Lawrence.
"1 was attracted to the opportunity
to get to know a larger percentage
ofthe students and facultyand have
real involvement in the community
and conversations about what mat-
ters to the library,"said Fyffe.

For SGA Vice President Chris
Ochoa '06. who served on the
search committee, Fyffe's attitude toward student inc
putwon him over. “To be honest,l can't remember his
scholarship at this point," Ochoa said, “but he gave off
an allraround positive vibe. The fact that he seemed
genuine about working with students and building a
successful Burling in the future is an indicator he will
be a good librarian."

While he has experience working in museum lie
braries similar in size to Butling, Fyffe's main career
focuses are special collections and computer technol-
ogy, both key to Burling‘s future. As Librarian of the
college, Fyffe hopes to fosrer a close collaborarion
between the library and ITS, and develop a strong
digital library program. “How knowledge is repre—
sented, how it’s presented and shared in a society, are
really critical questions."said Fyffe. “I want to have an
deeper conversation about how to reach student and
faculty needs."

Glitch kept
KDIC off air

by NIKOLOZ SAKVARELIDZE

College radio stations across the nation are
ofreti accused ofbeing plagued with problems be-
cause oftechaical malfunctions and employee inex-
perience. Last week KDIC had a technical problem
that went a bi: beyond the usual

KDIC was oft the air for a week beginning lasr
Tuesday when the station's transmitter failed. The
problem turned out to be a matter of switches being
in a wrong position, but it took time to bring in a
mechanic to identify and fix the problem.

The mechanic told station manager Graeme
Miller ’06 that he thought the problem Vlms caused
bythe students breaking in the cooling starionwhete
the station’s transmitter was housed. "He said that
there were some hooligans in there messing around
with the heating equipment,” said Miller.

Student DJ Chris Farstad '09 said that he was
surprised that the problem was so small "I was so
cretly hoping that it was something major, so we
could get new equipment,‘ Farstacl said.

KDIC employees are taking the problem seri—
ously. “It’s kind of had, because it’s kind of hard to
get people to listen to the radio station anyway,"
said DJ Joe McNertney loo. “Going oer air for a
week [doesn't help Iliad."

Miller agreedi “It adds to the impression that
the radio station is unprofessional and ﬂaky," he
said.

This was the first time that the station had been
off air due to mechanical problem in at least three
or four years, according to Miller. KDIC often has
minor problems in the studio, but majol problems
with the transmitter are rare,

KDIC is not large enough to employ a ﬁillrtime
mechanic to fix problems when they arise. Instead,
the station hires the mechanic for the University of
Iowa’s radio statioiis,Jim Davies, to come in when
KDIC has a problem. Davies also works for many
other stations in Iowa, including KGRN. He was
not able to come in immediately to fix KDIC’s
problem, but when he did come in on Sunday, he
was able to fix it in a few minutes.
