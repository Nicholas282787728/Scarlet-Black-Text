“Women’s

ALLISON SHAW
STAFF WRITER

This \veekcnd, a cast ofalniost
twenty Orinnell students is putting
on a production called “\Vomen's
Voices,” a collection of M various
pieces about many different aspects
or women's lives. The pieces are
scenes, songs, and a laige number of
monologues, each of which was se<
lectetl from outside sources by the
indiVidual performer The notable
exceptions to this are two mono—
logues by Timeca Briggs and
Kathennelager,whoeachwrotetheir
works themselves. Regardless ofthe
source, each performers piece is
something that speaks strongly to
them, says student Lindsay McBride,
the production'sdireetor. Thegroup
decided “we’d each ptclt out our own
voice. . rather than me tellingthem
to do something," McBride says.

Each performer was able to dic«
tate exactly how they would do their
piece. The rest of the cast offers
suggestions and ideas, but the per-
fotmet has the freedom to keep all
aspects of the piece that are impor—

McBride explains it might be hard
for some of |hc audience to under

the pieces, but that is one of the
trade—offs necessary for the kind of

STAFF WRtTER

Comic books ate not ,ust for
children any more. And the mem.
bets ofthe recently founded Grinnell
Comics Publishing organization will
be the first to argue that sequential
art, as of comics, demands recognr
tion,

Grinnell Comics Publishing is
the idea of three sophomores, Aaron
Dale.AdamWittzfeldandMike Cart.
and hopes to bring together students
With ideas and interests in sequential
art and comic books “We want to
get together the people who want to
create,” says Dale, one of the found
mg members.

“We thinlt there's probably a lot
oftnterest in starting this up, and we
want to encourage this," says
Wittzfeld, another rounding memr
bet, TheyexpecthinnellComics to
attract comic book collectors, fans
and art inaiors, but they hope to find
all students with any interest in se~
quential arr.

Their ultimate goal, as Wirrzfeld
defined it, is “to create an anthology
of sequential art.“ By creating a fo»
tum for these individuals to interact

and share ideas, their organization
will foster the creation and produc—
tion of art.

Each of the founders have expe-
rience With other college publica—
tionsand have contributedtheirown
artwork. Last semester, Carr and
Geoff Bright ‘98 independently pro-
duced dERF, a collection of their
own cartoons and art. But the money
{or that proieet came from their own
pockets, something which Otinnell
Comics hopes to avoid by acquiring

funds from Student Government or
the Student Publication and Radio
Committee,

Even in Burling Library,
Wirtzfeld and Dale have noticed the
lack otgraphicnovelsoranthologies
of comics, which they have seen in
many other libraries. The organiza—
tion hopes to get important works,
such as Mans, a PuliE’LEI’ Prize win-
ning graphic novel, into the library.

For now, the three founders are
concentrating on building interest
and membership. They encourage
students to contact them via com—
puter, at [DALEA].

The performances are at 8:00pm this

considering putting together a sec—
ond group of pieces next semester, to
make it a regular event. McBride
mentiom that “a lot of people in the
east have been talking about how
good it is to just work on something
that’s small, but at the same time
means a lot to them.”
