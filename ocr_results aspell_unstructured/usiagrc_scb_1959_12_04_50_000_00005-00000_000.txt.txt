Fisher In Ceylon
Communication,

by Al Fisher

COLOMBO, CEYLON: It
seemed strange last night to
read of a cold wave in the us.
when here the weather re—
mains nice and warm. ,The sun
seems to be very hot at this
time of year; I was out tor
just a couple of hours la‘st,Sun—
day at some motor races, and
I managed to get a slight sun-
burn. But, knowing the winters;
which Grlnnelllans have to err'
dure, i won’t ~ub things in.

I have no idea what. if any-
thing; you read in the news'l
papers concerning currenti
events in CCylon.‘I would ,not
be too surprised If you had not
seen anything about Ceylon
since the assassination of Mr.
Bandaranaihe in the latter part
or September, ilere the only
news we read of the United
States concerns foreign policy
and aid to Ceylon; but occas-
ionally there is something about
the recent steel strike, a cold
wave, an a' plane crash or the
launching ol a missile or sateln
lite. ,

Another contact with events
in America is magazines, Time,

e, Look, and even Playboy.
These are limited to those who
can read English, unless one
wants only to look at the pic-
ture Speaking oi pictures,l
movies are also a medium or,
cultural cont-act, There are
about seven theatres in Colom—
bo which run English-speaking
pictures, most of which are
American productions To give
you an idea of the time lag in.
volved, current films are “St.
Lou, Blues,” ”Matchmaker,"
“Boll, Boc]: and Candle,“ and
“What Lola Wants." This lastl

this title did not satisfy the
better interests at the U.S., and
so it was changed It play d unn
der this new title even in Eng
land.

A final medium of. contact,
probably the most popular, is
American music. The eoiiimei»
cial service oi the government
operated Radio Ceylon broad-
casts in English from 7710 am,
1—3, pm and 5-11 pm, From
10 a l pm. and 375 pm,
the, broadcasting is in sinhala.
The commercial service pro—
grams are sponsércd, as are
practically all musical and
sports events. ,

The other service of Radio
Ceylon is the national nonncom-
mei-eial service, with less mu-
e and more programs or an
ntellcctual nature or public
interest and relays 01 BBC
broadcasts.
present is not allowing the na—
tional service to relay the BBC
news programs because of ”in-
statcments made
about the new government of
Ceylon. This banning will con-
tinue as long as the state of
emergency exists.

The commercial service or
Radio Ceylon is very popular
outside of Ceylon. The high.
power transmissions are i‘CCCIVa
ed all through southeast Asia,
(India, Pal tan, Burma, Ma
laya, Singapore) and as lai-
away as England and Australia

express train which covered
lso miles in six hours and the

rural dirt roads. However. trains
in Ceylon vary quite a bit.
There is still on

old narrow ‘

gauge railroad which runs fromv

Colombo to Rainapura,

tourist pamphlet puts it, “It {Si

cats' eyes and amethysts tor the

past 2500 years have been ob—l

.talncn'lL The distance between
the two cities is about 600
miles, but the train takes about
five hours for it has many hills
to climb in that time,

The trains in Ceylon have
three classes. First class, being
about three times as expensive
as third class, has the softest
seats and nicest compartment,
In second Class trains the
seats are somewhat harder.
Third class is the most heavily
‘travclcd; the seats are 01' wood
and are hard. Trains are made
up of all three class coaches,
Most engines are coal or wood
burners, but slowly, diesel ene
‘gincs are being added Recent-
ly, the first of 25 diesel power
units arrived in Ceylon as port
