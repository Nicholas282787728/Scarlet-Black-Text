Friedman Tells 0f Oppo

by Jim Alt

”I didn’t have to elbow aside
a long line of people for the
job .. which, as it turned out,
was for a very good reason."

Richard Friedman, 1951 Gr—
innell graduate and recent uns
successful candidate for
mayor of Chicago against Ri-
chard Daley, spoke on Chicago
politics Wednesday evening in
Roberts Theater. Describing
his campaign, Friedman told
of his initial optimism that
people “might get together."
In the final days of the cams
paign Daley appealed toracial
prejudices related to public
housing projects, Friedman
said his optimism gave way
to pessimism and cynicism.

Although Friedman ran as a
Republican against the Demo—
crat Daley, his campaign was
geared to appeal to Republir
cans, dissatisfied Democrats,
independents, and portions of
minority groups. Friedman
fought an uphill battle against
the Daley political machine;
he spent $2' 5 000 to Daley’s
estimated $4,000,000. In ad
dition, Friedman noted com-
mon instances of vote fraud:

“In many precincts, 100% of
the voters walk into the voting
booth with the precinct cap-
tain, who pulls the lever for
him.

“Welfare checks are tleliv~
ered to precinct captaiiis,who
tell the recipients, ‘If you
don’t v0te right, you don’t get
the chcck.’

“At some voung machines,
the tally was 1500 or 2500
for Daley before the polls
opened. We sent some pilOIU’
graphers out before a a.m. to

tional philosophy.

John C. Dawson, a full pro-
fessor, willreturn to the Gfln’

from 1957 to 1969, spent a
year on the Staff of the Board
of Governors of the Federal
Reserve as a researcher, and
spent two years as lecturer in
economics at Makerere Unis
versity in Uganda.

He will teach a freshman [0*
torial next yearand eventually
will teach something on
1\frioa, either by himselfor on
an interdisciplinary basis. His
interests are developmental
and institutional economics.

William Michael Cavanagh,
who is finishing his Ph.D.
work at the University ofMin-
nesota, will fill in for James
Kissane next year, who will
be on leave while serving as
visiting professor of English
at the University of Kentucky.

o ers College Forcing

Nineteen members of the

nonracatlemic staff who are
65 or over will be forced to.
retire as of July 1 to enable
the college to eliminate five
positions at thcphysicalplant.

President Glenn Leggett told
the 3&0 that the college was
forced to institutea mandatory
rctirc‘menl'BFGS policy be-
cause of the union contractand
the low turn-over of workers
in the physical plant. Budget
reqmrements forced the den
crease in the physical plant
staff.

Because of the contract, the
college felt that the only way
to reduce the physical plant
staff was toretire those workr
crs over 65. In addition, the
contract States the union‘s
expectation that OlhOI college
staff will be treated in about
the same manner as the union

workers. Therefore, 13 non-
physiml plant employees must
also be affected by the new
policy.

Until this year, the college
had had a policy of enabling
certain workers, at the col-
lege’s discretion, to stayuntil
they were 70.

Leggett complained that the
atmosphere surrounding last
year's B&G strike forced the
college to sign a less than
favorable contract. Heblamed
that contract for necessitating
the present action.

He said, ”Thisactionis taken

Dean Wall Speaks Al Phi Beta Kappa Ceremony

The Spring Chapel of Phi
Beta Kappa met in Herrick
Tuesday night to announce se-
nlors elected to the society.
Joseph Wall, Dean of the Cole
lege, addressed the group:
"i regard the Phi Beta Kappa
address as the most difficult
kind of address, except per-
haps that for a high school
commencement. Tonight at
least 1 shall not be speaking
on Andrew Carnegie."

Wall suggested that Phi Beta

get pictures of these machr
iiics; they were beaten up.

”I estimate that 150,000
votes were stolen from me
through vote fraud."

Despite such handicaps, Fr
icdman ran a strong cam—
paign. He issued a series of
14 position papers on issues
of welfare, transportation, edr
ucation, and others. He said,
“I demonstrated that the city
of Chicago was not doing a
good Job in thSC areas ._ but
Mr. Daley nevcr responded
until the last days of the cams
paign."

That was when Daley, after
an unsuccessful attempt to

suppress plans that called for
integrated public housmg,
publically condemned the
plans anti ihtis appealed to
racial prejudice. r\[lhi$ point,
Friedman Said, "Mr. Daley
was no longer running for
mayor of Chicago, but for
sheriff of some backwoods
county."

Friedman also tried to make
corruption and political pat-
roliztge an issue, hut tiiSCOV'
ercd that, "People in Chicago
were not one bit conccrned
about corruption.” Itisteatl,he
said, they tcnd to desire a

Kappa gatherings should con.
tent thcmselves with a re-
reading of Emerson's Phi
Beta Kappa address. Called
“America‘s declaration of
intellectual independence,"
the address in Wall's opinion
"says everything which needs
to be said about the scholar
antl his place in society.”

Speak .g of more contemporr
ary issues, Wall said, "If one
is selective enough of the CV’
ents of the past decade, one
can prove that if God is not
an idiot, at least he hasa very
wry sense of humor.”

Sugge ting that the [lll‘nul’
tuous sixties were a lransis
tional period, Wall consider
ed the theory that \nierica is
entering a new Romantic \ge.
He netcd the apparent nostal'
gia In current Broadway hits
like “No, no, Nanette," and
”This Follies.” The two best
sellers last year were "Love
Story" antl "The Greening of
v\mcrim."

Behind these and similarsus
perficiol evidences of roman-
ticism, Wall senscd a real

commitment on the part of at
least some young people to
reworking technology. They
exhibit "a romanticism temc
pered with pragmatism." Na-
der’s Razders do not reject
technology; they only want to
make it serve people's ends.

While conceding that some
youthful demands for acade-
mic "relevance" are “monor
tonous," Wall foundgreat sig-
nificance in students'new cri-
ticism and involvement in edu.
cation. He ended quickly:

"Tonight we honor th0se
members of the senior class
who have attained academic
distinction, however imper-
fectly that distinction may be
measured."

The first announcements
were of Book Awards, given
to those students with the
highest averages in their class
for the first three semesters
at Grinnell. The awards went
to Judy Barton, Loren Hart,
Tim Livengood, and Joyce
Nakamura.
