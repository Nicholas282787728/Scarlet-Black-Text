Based on the Who's bl'llllant1973cnncept
album, Quaili'olillenia is not a concert ﬁlm.
A near peiect integration or music and
story, it is a narrative set in the London
days of Mods and Rockers - the two warr-
ing lactions or British youth lor whom rock
and roll became a way of life ln the early
19605.

The Mnds dressed to kill. rode Vespa
scooters and lived for clothes, pills, British
pop and American soul music; the
Rockers were black leather jackets, rode
motorcycles and listened to "harder“ rock
like the Stones and 505 groups,

At the center oi the iilm IS a psychic
disintegration and self-destruction of Jim-
my, a British youth who becomes pro-
gressively more detached from society.
his family and his [ellow Mods He is a
rebel whose only cause \5 to somehow
escape the deadened world at Britian's
class society through dwgs, sex and
violence,

The superb acting of Phil Daniels as
Jimmy and Sting lol The Police) as his
Mod idol, and the glorious Who soundtrack
embellished with evocative soul oldies,
make Qlladropheniu an incredibly ac
complished portrait ot'a iascmatlng period
in rock history. it is a dynamic, exr
hllal'atlng experience und a mustsee l'or
