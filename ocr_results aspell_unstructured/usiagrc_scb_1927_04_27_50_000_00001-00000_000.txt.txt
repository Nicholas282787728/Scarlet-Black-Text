Minneapolis Orchestra Vindicates
Automcy of Symphony
Last Saturday,

GONTRASTS TSCHAIKOWSKY

Ferguson, Soloist, Contributes
To Success of Concert
As A Whole.

B)‘ G. "01‘1er Knight

The long anticipated concert or the
Minneapolis Symphony orcehstra
proved once more, if proof were nec—
essai , that the Symphony still holds
undisputed sway in the wide realms
of an aristocratic art.

in the program played last Satin»
day afternoon in the Herrick chapel,
Mr. Hon” Verbrugghen offered his
audience a little sturd t scintillat—
ing, liozart, some int guing and
charming Debussy, some vigorous
Schubert and much Tschaikowsky n
the form of an entire Symphony. it is
safe to say that it was the Symphony
that gave the audience the greatest
pleasure and which left in the minds
of its hearers impressions of a rare
beauty not soon to become dilniilctl or
forgotten.

Enthus‘ ism infectious

Few Symphonies have the elements
of contrast so strongly evidenced as
Tschaikowsky's F biinor Symphony.
Its first alovenient has a passionate
abandon. its second a gentle pathos,
its third is dainty conception of high
spi is and good humor, and its last
Movement exhibits emotions both di'fl~
matic and exc The Minneapolis
musicians found in this work means
of proving a virtuoso technique and
a'keen understanding, and‘tllose ops
portunities were seized with an eager—
ness and a convincing artistr. So
congenial to the musicians was the
Tschaikowsky score that they inter—
preted all its moods and nuances
with an infectious enthusiasm that
was transmitted to a sympathetic and—
ience, and so effectively indeed was
the entire Symphony performed that
its final cadences were followed by a
spontaneous expression of delight that
quickly assumed the proportions oi a
great ovation.

Deliussy’s “Pl-elude” Second

Second only in importance to the
Symphony was the performance of Der
bussy’s epoch—making Prelude, “The
afternoon of a Faun." Many attempts
have been made since Dehussy's time
to exploit new tonal systems and new
harmonic combinations, but none has
succeeded in persuading the public
that the “something new” is "some-
thing good" to the extent that the De-
bussy “Prelude" has. If the Minue-
apolis orchestra did not perform this
work with the fine authority dishing»
uishing its symphonic playing, the
fact need not occasion surprise, for
the rather small orchestra employed
compelled some slight sacrifice of colv
or. contrast and proportionate bale
ance.

bir. Bernard Ferguson, the assisting
baritone soloist. contributed largely to
the success of the concertasawhole.
iiis round, rich and vibrant voice and
his sympathetic understanding of the
popular excerpts he sang gave to his
performances definite grace and mor—
it. Grinnell will certainly welcome
Mr. Ferguson back again.

lineal-es Too Short

if, and when, the Minneapolis 01"
chestra again visits Grinneil, perhaps
some small coterie of earnest people
may be found who will intimate to the
distinguished conductor that although
a Grinnell audience dearly loves its
encores, it would much prefer not to
have them consist entirely of small
and backneyed pieces. interesting as
were all the the encore pieces played
last Saturday afternoon, they could
not possibly satisfy an eager audience
expecting, even hungeriug for, the
greatest music played by one of the
greatest orchestras,

Mr. Verhrngghen and his musicians
are to be congratulated on the unus-
ual success of their concert in Grin—
nell. it it should be Grinnell’s good
fortune to have them back again next
year, the Herrick chapel should be
found far too small a place to accom—
modate the teeming throngs clamor—
ing for admittance,

Record At Relays

Fails to Place In Discus As Do
other Pioneer Entries In
Kansas Track Meet.

"hloco” Rineiort heaved the discus
142 feet to break the Kansas record in
that event in the ifansas relays last
Saturday after failing to show his ac»
customed form in the shot put event.

Donald Laird, who has sent the
iavelin close to 190 feet, forgot that
he was supposed to he in the money
and failed to do in). Now that he has
had his 1927 debut he should he able
to toss the spear close to his former
mark. “Butch" lieeter, a discus star,
was also stage struck. His best
throw fell below the 125 foot mark.

The Kansas classic, while held un—
der the most unfavorable weather con'
ditions of its ﬁve year existence. was
marked by fast time and close camper
tition. iowa university negotiated the
mile relay in 3:20, but were pushed
to the limit by a team from Texas
which covered the distance only a
tenth of a second slower. The kansas
university hail-mile relay team run its
event below the worlds record, but
were disqualified because of irregu-
larities in passing the baton. Conger,
running anchor on the Ames distance
medley squad, covered the mile in
4:21, and Caulnm, a team mate, ran
a half in 1'58.

The Tirajnhua lndians gave the suns
flower state a thrill when they finish-
ed a 51 mile jaunt in a little more than
seven hours and were breathing with-
out eftort when they finished.

Spencer Asserts That Dormitories

What is a logic? Have the
dormitories or the quadrangle log-
giasl Edward B. T. Spencer, protes-
sor oi Greek, says they have not. And
Mr. Spencer should know, for be has
lived in the land of petty states and
Renaissance castles. Here is the
land of the loggia. But the Honor-
ablc Noah‘s dictionary- only tells us
that it is “A rooted open gallery." And
trunk and wagnnlls gives it as a
“covered gallery or Dol'tico.“

Well, to be frank, neither is much
of an authority, We should have de-

PIONEERS MAY WIN DISCUS

Half»Mi.le Relay Team, Two-Mile
Medley Quartet Will Ruii
For GnmJ' ell.

The trio which represented the Pio-
neers in Kansas, a llall‘rmlle relay
team, mid a twormile medley quartet
have been entered in the eighteenth‘
annual Drake classic to be held in
Des lioines next Saturday. ninefort
is doped to take the discus event, hav-
ing tossed the platter ever iii feet in
competition this season, and close to
150 in practice. if the day is warm, he
should also place well up in the iron
hall event, Although he failed to
show his customary form in the event
at Kansas, he is coming out oi the
kinks well this week,

Laird has fell. the thrill of big Cour
petition now, and should be able to do
his stuff at the Saturday meet, He has
buried the iavelin over 135 feet in
practice this season and should be
able to show in competition, lieeter
also had his case of the buck fever
for this year down in the sunflower
state, but should toss the discus over
130 [eel (I! the relays.

Ileluy Strength Uncertain

The exact strength of the two res
lay teams is as yet uncertain Duke
has a problem in picking a team lrom
liclfee, Tnlliott, Slve, Beck, Davis and
Hughes, all of whom are capable of
running a neat furlong, but none of
whom are outstanding. The distance
medley- in which one man runs a hall,
two a quarter, and one a mile, will
be chosen from i-ioffman, Gould, Mill-
er, I<ii1gery,‘Valters and Whitley.

The Drake relays should be as fast
as ever this year. iowa U. has an ex-
cellent chance to repeat its last year’s
win in the mile relay, The quartet is
capable of stepping the distance under
3:20. Cuhel, the anchor man, is also
a hurdler star, and is doped to do well
in the barrier event. Capt. Eoyles, a1—
so of iowa, who cleared the bar at 12
feet 6 inches down south to tie (or
second place, has a chance to win the
pole vault.

Amos lllny Will Medley

The Times distance medley looks
like the money in that event. Conger,
one of the outstanding distance rilu~
ners in the United states, is anchor
man for the squad. Nebraska will
furnish stiff competition. The Iowa
State two mile relay team stepped its
event in 7:52 last Saturday, and has a
this chance to repeat this Week,

The Oregon four-inlle team, which
has been well in the running at the
classic the last three years looks like
the class in the distance grind. it
will meet stiff competition from illin-
ois U. however, The Kansas half
mile relay team, which set a world’s
record last week but was disqualified
for irregular baton passing, should do
well at the Bulldog meet. it will have
rough going with Notre Dame and
iowa on the oval in the event, how-
ever.

H. M. (Dad) Butler, Oregon Assle
coach, will referee the meet. He is
bringing a sound from the western
state for the fifth consecutive year.
