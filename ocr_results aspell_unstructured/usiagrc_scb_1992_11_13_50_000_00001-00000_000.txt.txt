They started out their interview
by earnestly thanking the students

Hate Crime?

Arson in student's apt.

by Howard Horn

Senior Tarell X was the victim
of an alleged “hate crime" when
someone stole the keys to his apart
merit and attempted to set his couch
on fire.

The incident occurred Wednes-
day evening. “Tarell went into the
apartment at 10 pm," said junior
Raytnuttdo Luna, friend of the vic-
ttm. ”On his couch were smoldering
old copies of the Scarlet andBltzck."
The damage to the couch was min‘
tnal. “Tttrell put [the fire] out," arr
cording to another friend of the VlCr
tiin, junior Elisabeth Bailey. The
vtcttui called the police, but accord-
ingto Bailey,thcpoliccseclncdlttorc
interested in the damage to the prop
erty than the motive for the crime.
Tlte assallant “got the keys from my
tackct at the Forum.” according to
Titrell.

Tarcll and his frlcnds believe the
motive for thecrimewasracial. “This
happened because Tarell is politically
radical and because he is black." said
Bailey. “Tarellplaysloud tapes of the
Leader, Louis Faiakkan. Some people
took of Tense." Luna said. This is not
the first time that Tarell has been the
victim of a racially motivated break-
in and couch burning. A similar inci-
dent happcnod to Tarell during his
second year at Grinncll.

None of the three students be-
lieves thatcrimeorviolenceis thebest
avenue forresolvingproblems. Luna
referred to the crime as “cowardly”
saying that instead of usmg violence
to resolve a conflict, those who comr
mined the crime because of a differ-
enceofoplnion“should talk toTruell."
Tarcll explained. ”Grinnell needs to
recognize there are racial problems...
We needle work on this as a commur
ntty."

Koch and Ostdiek speak on
sexual harassment ‘

by Amy Anderson

Students Kristina Koch and
Alice Ostdick, held a tworpart pre-
sentation Tuesday on the cmpowcrr
ment of student groups desiring
change and the continuing progress
of the studentrnin Change and Jus-
tice in dealing with sexual harassV
ment.

Koch based her presentation on
both her experiences with Change
and Justice trying to change
Grinnell‘spollciesconcemingsexual
harassment and assault and her work
on the Presidential Task Force on
Sexual Harassment.

ThemalnlecusofKtxh’sspcech
was suggestions for how other stu4
dent groups can get the kind of re-
sttlts that Change and Justice did
alter lists of alleged rapists were

discovered on the Burling restroom
walls last semester. Among her rec-
ommendations were to gain visibil-
ity by using the media, establishing a
“broad base of popular support," in-
siitutionalizing beliefs, being aware
of the laws as tools for change,
“tnaintaing a safe environment on
campus to discuss the issues,“ con»
tacting other colleges to learn from
their ideas and policies, and to real-
tzc that “survivors are your greatest
asset." Because of her experience
with Change and Justice, Koch laid
stress on this last point because sur-
vivors of any injustice have “first
hand knowledge of discrimination
and how to protest."
