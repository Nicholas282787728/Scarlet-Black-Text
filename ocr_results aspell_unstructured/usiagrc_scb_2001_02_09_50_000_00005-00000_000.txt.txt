A review of Mark Knopfler's i
newest album

Sai ing» it

by Pat O'Neil
Staff Writer

From its OUISL‘K, rock and roll has been a youth-ori-
ented art: it ls the musie or (tentidols, oi teeiiyboppers,
and ortwentyeseven yeareold niarryis, only recently hove
rock and rollers attempted to treat the issue orgrovving old
in their musie. or the ﬁrst wave or rockers, only Roy
Orbison and Ray Charles made it to maturity with
artistic integrity intact, but their new music mostly
ichashed their old. Veterans from the sixties have
fared better: Bob Dylan‘s Time Out 0/‘Mr'ndand
Paul Simon's new album, You’re 1/7: One, arc
moving, orten revelatory mediations on life as the dregs orpop eule
rure pass rhem by. New Mark Knopﬂer, who provided the voice
and guitar behind classic rock giants Dire Straits, adds his voice to
the mix with Sailing n: Pluhdslp/zm.

That voiee, by the way. is a marvel. Knopﬂer's voiee has always
had an ancient resonance to it i remember the first time I heard
“Money rot Nothing" by Dire straits, over the intercom in a gro—
cery store, although the song was catchy enough to be on the radio,
{couldn't believe that such a weathered, Scifvmocklng voice was ate
raehed to an actual roekstar. In my mind,
roek stars were all peppy and young, eter.
nal Beatles, or at least New Kids on the
Block. But this guy sounded ru. And
pudgy, With the added weight of ﬁfteen
years, his voice compares well to that oh
bedrnggied old bluesmnn, mascniine,
weary, and deadpan. And though hes
hardly a dynamic singericspccially Comv
pared to guests Van Morrison and James
Taylor—he hits his notes with a tender-
ness and restraint that make his slightest
vocal turn riveting.

Unlike Dylan, whose latest opus is an extended meditation on
one man's struggle as death closes in, in which none or the lyrics
come from anyone but Dylan himself, Knopiler assumes the guise
of a different character on almost every song, As he traverses the
generations, Knoptler achieves greatness by making a diverse esta—
logue of memories seem both uniﬁed and tragie. An aging gospel
singer reﬂects upon life on the road; a grizzled barily cruelly baits a
pop singer; Jeremiah Dixon and Charles Mason debate Amcrlca's
future in a beaurrrul preamble to the Civil War: what these disparate
people have in eonimon is a sense orsomerhing greater than them.

tragic.

The Patient Process

Art show is well worth the wail

As he traverses the genera-
tions, Knopfler achieves
greatness by making a di—
verse catalogue of memo-
ries seem both uniﬁed and

selves, and an inability to reign in whatever it is.

Knopiler has a novelists flair ror capturing an everlasting mt)»
merit, and a tlnmalisr's sense or pathos. lii “Prairie Wedding,“ a
farmer tentatively shows his mailorder bride his farm: “1 fro-L: as
she stepped in the doorway / stood there as still as eould be / i said
I know it ain’t much, it needs a woman's touch / Lord she turned
around and looked at me." The silenee or that moment, as the
singer trails otrin the last line, is crushing. “SpeedwayuNmrcrh,”
the best song on the album, reatures a raceccar driver's roster of a
year’s worth otrailures, set to dark bluegrass hare
monies and ending with the ominous declaration
that ”At the speedway at Nazareth I made no mis»
take." The hand then dives into a swirl ororga.
tilted confusion. the comeeandego rumble orthe
inst merits mimicking thosounds iron. rhelloor
ora racetrack, The eireet is exhilarating, and purg.
lug; whatever regrets the driver still has. the joy or
the rate ioreeo them from our minds.

Though synthesizers oetasionally embellish his
tunes, Knoptlcr mainly utilizes a traditional Ameri—
can parlor band: bass, guitars, piano, organ, ﬁddle
and drum, all played with eteeptional prorieieney and steeped in
aneient musioal forms. ltsiands to reason that as Knoptler has moved
away from the youth.obsessed world or pop radio, he has concen»
trated his sound in the blues and eounrryetwo genres that have
rarely shunned the insight orelders. For Knopﬂer, as with all great
blues artists, that insight entails a distillation of the human expsriv
once to its deepest and simplest emotions, born orycars ordisap.
pointment, mixed with hope. on the album's first traek, he dc»
scribes drunken “lads 1nd lasses" Wandering around at night. and
rasps, “Everybody's looking ror somebodys arms to fall into I And
it's what it is / It’swhar it is now." And no matter how old you are,
it always will be.

At first glance, Frank Gerriri's pieces seem to be

own reflection in the work Gerrir; is one of innu»
mnrablc artists whose efforts are often forgotten in
the ﬁnal product, The work and time that goes into
the creation orart intrigued cotcurarors Donald Doe
and Lesley Wright, After four years ofcxploring the
hidden processes, “The Patient Process" opened at the
Faulconct Gallery February 3.

“The Patient Process” features 10 different artists
with equally unique styles and backgrounds. All or
the artists were interviewed about their process for
the gallery guide. “That's a piece orit you don't often
hcarehow it's made," coecurntor Lesley Wright said.
she describes the artists as “a diverse group who are
all abstractwith varied deﬁnitions ofahsrractlun." The
works tend to be a blend of abstract expressionism,
minimalism ind eoneeptual art, though none or the
artists is purely one style.

Doe and Wright, while working on another show
in Saint Louis, created a working thesis that
midwestern artists adopted a unique process ror maka
ing art, The thesis explored whether or not the attlr

rude or the midwesr eonrribured to a slower, more
complicated process. While putting together this
show. they discovered other artists who have very in-
volved steps as well. According to Wrighr “The pa.
tient Process" attempis to answer ihe questions: “ls it
[aslow complieared pate] a regional or personal phee
nomenon.> and does where you hve errect the process
in whieh you make art?"

This exhibir is comprised or mnny local artists,
three are from Iowa and two are front chieago Wright
reels that it is imporrant that “shows include
inidwestern arrisrs beeause there is talent here, too."
Another perk to having regional artists is rhat several
will be on eainpus to speak at the gallery about their
own individual processes. Two of the artists, John
Andrews and signe Stuart are teaehingsriidio arr short
eouises whieh run until spring break.

“The Patient Proeess" is eomposed orreeenr works,
many whieh were made in the past ten years. While
the exhibit does not have as many pieces as the previ.
ous shows have, the pietes rcqilirc a closer look. The
exhibit is all about “slowing down the inspection prev
tess" Wright said The exhibit demands thesame pr
tienee and understanding from the viewer that the
artist poured into the pieees. “Painting itselris a Ian-
guago. They [the artists] wrestle with that in their
proeess," Wright said.

“The Patient Process" will be at the Faulconcr
Gallery through April 15,
