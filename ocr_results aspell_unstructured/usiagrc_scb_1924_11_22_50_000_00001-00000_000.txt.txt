fExpert Econolm‘st Discusses Character
and Growth of Labour More-
moot in Englnnd.

Mr. Ben. H. Wilson of Berkeley,
Calitornia, who J. Ramsay Michons
:ald, England’s famous Labor Premier,
declares to ,be the best informed
American on the British Labor Move-
.men}. and its personalities, has been
leading a number of discussions dur-
ing the past week on topics relating
'to industrial problems.

Besides taking charge of the chapel
service on both Thursday and Friday
mornings, the noted Californian spoke
before the joint meeting of the Y. M.
'C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. held Thurs-
day night and conducted several open
forum! group discussions.

Shows English Methods

Although, as Mr. Wilson rather bus
.morously put it. “The ’Thief of
Bagdad' stole a. good portion of the
crowd" on Thursday night. the econ-
omist gave a very enlightening discus
sion of the methods used by our Eng<
lish friends in solving their problems.
He reviewed the growth of the Labor
Party from a mere handful of men
to a membership of millions, He al-
so explained something of the work-
ings of the cooperative system. This
system, which handles billions of (his
lars worth of business yearly. places
the agencies of production and mark-
etlng under the direct supervision ot
the people interested, thereby “elimin-
ating excess profits and minimizing
the cost of the products distributed.

"There is nothing wrong with the
universe, but there are things wrong
in the universe,” Mr. Wilson declared
in Chapel yesterday morning. He con-
tinued his discussion of the subject,
"The Next Step," by outlining some of
the changes which are taking place in
the modern World.

’ People Dissatisfied

The old order. he said, is being dis-
lodged. Gelmany has become a. re-
public. Russia. is trying an experi-
ment in communism. I'iabor candi<
dates hnve been elected in France, Bel-
gium, Switzerland, Austria, and even
in Mexico. People. the world over,
are breaking from their political moor-
lugs. According to the press, the La.-
bar Party in England was smasbiuglyl
defeated in the last election. Yet, a
very substantial gain was apparent in
the returns. In fact, another such
smashing defeat would put the Labor
Pal-Ly in power. Great progress is
now possible in practically every na—
tion because the people are getting a
new social vision of Christianity.

“The postponement of matters is a
delusion,” said Mr. Wilson. ”Now is
eternity. Men of intelligence, Worms
eh of conviction, must organize to put
the principles or Christ's teaching ll1~
to practice in the economic world.
Therein lies‘ the task of our college
young people; to take the leadership
in the extension of democratic. Chris-
tian principles to the ends of the
universe." '

The Church has a, definite part in
this program oi social uplift. Mr. Wile
son believes. It must help in the
development of a Christian conscience
which understands the great industrial
problems. Economic anustice must
he abolished. We can no longer be
satisfied with mending the times; we
must build for eternity. The chum
must teach, not to get ready tor eter-
nity, but how to live.

Baylor and Wellesley
Disagree on Marriage

If students marry at Baylor Col-
lege, the couple are forced by a
faculty decree to spend a year's
honeymoon outsidc of the collcge.

At Wellesley they manage these
things differently. The college gives
a course in love and marriage. The
loverlorn and heart broken students
at Wellcsley rcccive first»aid "ht
on the campus.

The dean of the school of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Texas
is of the opinion that the dccroc for—
bidding marriage between students
while they are still undergraduates is
“illegal."

(By Emil Billion)

The Grinnell string Quartet furn-
ished an evening of interesting cham—
ber music in their first recital of the
year. The program included a fa-,
miliar quartet by Haydn, some short!
er compositions and Mendelssohn’s
Quartet op 12. us we have learned
to expect, the music was played skill-
fully, giving evidence at all times of
precision and care. The program was
well planned, affording pleasing con-

trasts. }

We found the quartet at its best in
the Mendelssohn Work. Here ths
ensemble was characterized by excel—
lent attack and release; the individual ,
players secured a tone of marked
depth and solidity; their bowing was
excellent. The three movements of‘
the composition showed the quartet as
a splendid unit. The whole was a
glowing creation, deft sud gracetul.

The lighter compositions were well
executed for the most part. Nocturne
of Borudine was lyric in its beauty.
the melody being well sustained
throughout. In the earlier part of the L
program there was a noticeable ten-
dcncy to sharp on the part of several
of the musicians. At times the inter-
pretations kicked color and vitality.

Dopesters Declare That Grinnell
Can Trounce Notre Dame 120-35

If ﬁgures don't lie, a (dot long es-
tablished, Gl'lnnell hits the best foot-
ball team that has ever followed the
sport since 1598 when Snake River
wallopcd Apple Junction 165-2, Here
is our carefully conceived logic:

(1) Minnesota bent Illinois 2177, but

-Illill0!S heat Iowa 364), mulling Minna»

sold 51 points better than Iowa. But
Grinnell bent Amcs by one point, and
Amos tied Minnesota, so We are 52
points better than Iowa.

.(2) Grinnell is 52 points better than
Iowa, Iowa beat Minnesota 13—0, Min—
nesota beat Illinois 21-7. so Grinnell
is 52 plus 13 plus it points better than
Good.

(3) AS We are 78 points better than
Illinois, and as Illinois conquered
Michigan 39.14, then Grll-mcll is is
plus 89 minus 14 points better than
Michigan. Whoopeen

(4) Getting down to brass tacks. in.

ilsmllctl as Grinnell is 103 points better
than Michigan, and as Michigan
downed Minnesota 13-0. Grinncll, in a
postseason ' game, would demolish
Minnesota 11747,

(5) Wisconsin is in the same boat as
Minnesota. as they played a tic game,
so then 117-0 still stands.

(G) The mighty Notrc name would
crumble bciorc the Pioneer onslaughts
like Grlllncll High against Harvard.
For proof. Notre Dame beat Wisconsin
3873. but we are 117 points better than

Wisconsin, so goudcliye, Notre Dame,‘

“This rcvolt is due in a large meas-

been observed by thc great majority
of the studcnts and as an aftermath
the Freshmen are becoming very lax
in respecting traditions of the college
that should be religiously adhered to,
Some have practically refused to

Girls to Choose; 'rheir Own Groups

Girls are divided according to their
inclinations and interests into sec-
tions for the study of dramatics, mus-
ic. journalism, recreational work. and
parliamentary law. These sections
will meet every other Friday after—
noon. alternating with allecallege sac
eial functions. The purpose, name.
and general plans for each group were
presented at the meeting yesterday. It
is planned that practically no prepar-
dtioh Will be necessary in the case of
most of the groups.

The Tanager Players, as the dru—
matic group will be called, will work
with Mrs. Hallie Flanagan. Heading
will probably be limited to some phase
of the drama. study of dramatic pro-
duction will also bemade, with the
all-college spring revue in mind. It
is hoped that the work or this auction
will unearth new mater-lad for Grinnell
dramatics.

The Tanager monsters, the sec-
tion for musical activity. will be un-
der the direction of David Peck.
Many interesting plans for group sings
ing. among them Christmas carolling,
are under way. The requirement for
membership is not an unusual voice.
but a genuine enjoyment of singing.

Alpha Delta chapter of Theta. Sigma
Phi, national journalistic fraternity
for women, will sponsor the work of
the Tanager Scribes, the section for
journalism. Study will be centered on
the editing and publishing of newspa—
pers and magazines.

Miss Harriett Koglin, instructor in
women’s physical education for wom-
en, will direct the work of the Tanager
Jesters. These girls will study how to
engage in and direct group recreation:

The Tanager Quibblers, girls who
are interested in the study of parliam-
entary law, will be under the leader-
ship of Miss Read. Questions of no.-
tioual and campus interest will be
discussed in parliamentary form, thus
giving a. double value to the work of
this section.

Dr. Steiner Urges Co-opcrah'on

Preceding the presentation of the
plan, Dr. Steiner, at whose suggestion
the plan was projected, {allied to the
girls about the genuine value of the
guild. It will offer opportunity for

[ill-EDS LiKE BASKETBALL

W. A. A. Bozml To Give One Point For

Semester of “Cage" Work

Making basketball a recognized
course in physical education. with one
point's credit tor a semester’s work,
has proved a popular action or the W.
A. A. Board. Because more time is al.
lowcd and basketball serves as a regu-
lar activity, Quudites are signing up
in large numbers.

According to the coach, Miss Koglln,
classes are already swelled to capac—
ity. more girls are reporting for prdc»
ticc every day. and waiting lists tor
the various class-groups are growing
longer. A class in beginning basket~
ball is also being formed. Senior nor—
mal classes this semester are taking
the form or the study at the theory
and practice of basketball coaching.

The change should result in much
keener competition in the tournament
games for the Somers Cup this year.
Larger squads, undor stricter training
rules than those of last year, promise
good teams from each class.
