When the Grinnell college cycling club was created last
year, it barely had its wheels."Wc started the club to get peo-
ple who enjoy riding bikes to ride together," said Ahlberg.
Since then the club has evolved to encompass many
more aspects. “The goals orthe cycling club I think are sort

of twofold," said Rob Lewis, History and cycling club par-
ticipant. "one is to basically promote awareness orcycling
on campus'at sort of all levels, and the other is to sort of
offer a chalice for students who want to get a little more
seriously involved in the sport ofcoinpetitive cycling, sort of
help them get started racing. ”

Earlier this year, the cycling club presented an initiative

bike shop aims to provide hike care education and hike rea

$1425.50 to cycling club to support the bicycle shop and to
help the team attend two races. As the weather gets nice, the
club plans too set up shop in front orthe JRC. “People can
bring in their bike and we’ll do minor repairs for them, sort
or help the hikes

run more smooth—

In addition to
the hike shop the
group has focused
on getting more

group rides. “We
have fun rides on the weekends, especially when it's nicer
out, like early fall and spring," Wendel said. “If anyone
wants to ride, everyone has access to the Plans, where they
can post ifthey‘ie doing a ride, or they can send an e-mail
to the whole group,“

Aside from the casual gioup rides, the club also gets
involved Wll’h more competitive cycling. “We are going to
do sort of skills clinics later on in the spring," Lewis said.
Last summer, members of the club strengthened Grinnell’s
statewide image by participating in Registers Annual Great
Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, or RAGBRAI. According to
chdcl, the Grinncll team was well received by other races
at the annual competition. “People liked us on RAGBRAI,"
he said

The club team races In the North Central Collegiate
Cycling Conference, which organizes races in various loca»
tions during the spring. The team hopes this season to at»
tend its first race at University of Nebraska at Lincoln on
April 18th.

Aside from competing in more events, the team hopes
to expand and grow on campus. “I think an answer in the
future is hopefully sort of growing the presence orcycling on
this campus," Lewis said. “Whether it means getting more
people to go out and ride recreationally, encouraging them
to ride so that later in life so they will bikeecommute, or
whether it's turning it into a more competitive [club], cye
cling is a fantastic sport, it’s addictive."

Students bring mixed martial arts to the Grinnell campus

HY STEPHANIE NoknsTRoM

This semester the mats and pads ofn dingy, windowless room
in the PEC have been getting quite a workout

Prve days weeks, a group orstudents gather in the mat room
to exercise and practice the technical aspects of different martial
arts

"We're just a couple orgaiys who work out together and trade
what we know about the martial arts," said Ian VVarlick ’IOn

Warll'ck and David Paige '09, both members of the College's
swim tcam, started the workout sessions last year, Paige said he
tried to start a mixed martial arts club two years ago, but “it [6*
any failed pretty terribly" due to differences of opinion over the
nature of the club.

The group is mainly focused on ﬁtness, from running to lift»
ing weights. “1 don’t wantspcopl: to get the impression that it’s a
ﬁght club, that it’s really viclent,”Wnrllck said. “We do spar but
not a lot."

According to both Paige and WarLick, the group teaches each
other using the internet and books and by drawing on the mem-
bers’ experience in several different martial arts, including Muay
Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Brazilian )IueJEtsu, Judo, and forms ofwrcf
tling.Tho group has expanded to seven members, and they have
been working out since the end of the swim season.

“There’s a good base of people who actually do martial arts,
and if you can ﬁnd them and get them into the mar room they
can teach you a lot,"1’aigc said. “What I ﬁlndamcnmlly believe
about martial arts is that you can't he exclusionary.”

The appeal of the workouts is different for each participant,
though the group agrees that the workouts are overall a great
experience.

“What I like most is that your really get the chance to com-
pete with other students,“ said Anthony Oliveri '09, a regular
participant in the club. “But in a friendly, not antagonist way.”

According to Paige, one of the majoi ploblems the group
has encountered is the state of the mat room. “It’s abysmal the
way that room is treated,” Paige said. “A decent kick will go right
through those pads.”

However, Paige and Warhck are overall pleased with the way
their workouts are progressing. “What we’ve got going on is a lot

Despite not being a club, members accomplish a lot and learn
from each other. “When I’m in there, I’m student and teacher,"
Paige said. “i get a real sense or accornpllshment. I really want to

Currently, the group is not an official club and does not re»

omcial club status because of the obligation implied with it. "I
didn't try asking rot money because i remember the nasco last
