Mmsby encourages partcipation

by Hope Harman
“I like the small college at-
mosphere...there is a lot of room for
growth here.” This is a typical answer
to a typical question posed to most
newcomers at Grinneli.

For Merry Ormsby, a new member
of the physical educau'on department,
growth comes in the area of “women’s
athletics and PE. classes.”

Originally from lllinois, she has a
double major in physical edtication
and criminal justice trorn Youngstown
State College. Ormsby comes to Grin-
nell after receiving a M.A.
from Kent State and working part
time coaching at Mt. Union College.

Ormsby chose Grinnell (or a number

of reasons. She likes Grinnell’s size and

its athletic policies, “I don’t like the
idea of buying athletes...athletics is an
educational experience where

everyone who wans to should have
the opportunity to participate."
With enthusiasm, Ormsby en-
courages this growth and participa-
tion. She is coaching three sports:
and softball.

In addition to coaching, Ormsby
sponsors the fencing club and teaches
PE. classes. She is also the Grinnell
representative to the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women

Women’s Cross Country

A lack ot conditioning is a major
concern for Coach Mary Ann Pankey
as she prepares her women’s cross
country team for its opening meet of
the season.

The Pioneers will host Cornell on
Saturday, in a 2-mile race which will
start and finish north of the college
tennis courts ,

, “We’re not in very good physical

, shape," Pankey stated, “And, to make

, matters worse, two of our top
veterans, Toni Heiman and Ruth
Raich, are slowed by foot injuries.”

Heiman and Raich comprise half of
Pankey‘s corps of returning letter win-
ners. The others are Julia Carver and
Diane Morgan.

l-leiman captured individual honors
as Grinnell won the Midwest Con-
ference title a year ago, Morgan plac-
ed fourth and Raich was 11th.

Kamerine Hughes, another standout
on the 1978 team, is passing up cross
country this fall because of a heavy
classroom and work schedule. She was
number two runner at last year's loop
encounter.

Stacy Carp and Lisa Wickstrom are
regarded as the top newcomers on the

‘ squad.

, Women’s Field Hockey

Coach Merry Ormsby will be '
looking for a lot of answers when her
field hockey team opens the 1979

1 season by participating in the Nor-
thern Iowa Clinic at Cedar Falls on

Grinnell will play 30-minute cuntesLs
, against the state's other five
teamsiGraceland, Iowa, Iowa

lgmbel 7, H77?

Wesleyan, Luther, and Northern Iowa.
“I expect to get a much better line
on our players and on the other teams
in the state," noted Ormsby. “l’m 0p-

timistic that we will have a good
team. There seems to be a good
nucleus of talent on the squad, but we
have a lot of work to do."

Ormsby has eight letter winners on
her squad of 18 women They are:
Laurie Cragg, Catherine Gillis, Diane
Hearst, Kim Krutilla, Ann Markman,
Stephanie Nelson, Susan Weller, and
Desiree Winkler.

Grinnell's numerous offcampus
study programs have struck a
devastating blow to Ormsby’s hopes of
matching the 11-4-2 record posted by
the 1978 field hockey team.

Four 1978 letter winners are current-
ly studying off-campus—Lisa Bowers,
the most valuable defensive player;
Sue Henken, Harriett Rhinney, and
Mia Turneri Phinney and Turner
each collected six goals.

Sonja Balstad, who was selected as
the top offensive player a year ago
after leading the attack with 11 goals,
is no longer ‘in school.

Laura Sinai is leader of the
freshman contingent.

Men’s Cross Country

A cautiously optimistic Ray Ober-
miller will send a veteran men's cross
country team to compete against One
and Cornell Saturday.

The opening meet of the campaign
for the Pioneers, it will be run over a
4-mile course on the campus. It will
begin at ii a.m., north of the college
tennis courts.

'Dave Cooke, and Dick Gilbert, are

once around the field

“We have a lot of potential and can
have a very successful season if we
stav healthy," noted Obermiller. But,
has somewhat gun shy after entering
the 1978 season with high hopes and
then seeing his squad decimated by in-
juries and illness.

“Most of our veterans did a lot of
running during the summer and
reported back to campus in good
physical condition," Obermiller
reported.

Three of the returnees, Terry Drew,

currently holding down the top spots
on the team. Also on the squad are
nine other men who have lettered in
cross country and/or track: Kevin
Koy, Roger Sayre, Chuck Rekully, Bill
Strang, Steve Pfarrer, Tim Poison,
Gary Birch, Bruce Packard, and Tim
Caver.

The veterans will have to carry
most of the load during the early go-
ing because three promising
newcomers—Thomas Bannister,
Charles Briggs, and Bill
Kwochka~are hobbled by injuries.

New [M Spirit

A feeling of “relaxed competition"
is stressed by this semester‘s IM
organizers Larry Pistrang, Julie
Bowers, and Barry Huff.

Pistrang said, “We want this
semester‘s [M’s to be games between
friends, We don't want to create fierce
rivalries between dorms."

weekend of Sept, is. Coed flag football
will be featured, with four man/four
