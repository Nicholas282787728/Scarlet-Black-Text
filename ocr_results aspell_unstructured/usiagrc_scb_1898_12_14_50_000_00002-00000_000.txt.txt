ON i\l:X'r Tuesday evening will
beheld the home contest of the
Iowa College oi-atorical associar
tion, which will decide who will
represent Grinnell at the state
contest, to be held in Mt. Vernon
in February, Six have already
signiﬁed their intention of come

contest is assured. SCARLET AND
BLACK wishes to urge upon the
students that more attention and

place which he is to occupy. No
