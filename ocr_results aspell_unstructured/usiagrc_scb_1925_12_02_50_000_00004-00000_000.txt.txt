A 30 yard places ck in the closing_
ininutes“ai thc game by Captain Levy,
Washington fullback. gave the Pikers
a see win over Gi'inilell at St, Louis
Thanksgiving day. As a result of the
contest, Grimlell was shoved into a
tie for filth place in the final valley
standings, whereas a victory would
have placed the Pioneers in undisput—
ed second place.

' The battle took place on a tnrfless
field. the miiddiest and worst gridiron
that Grinnell encountered during the
season, A heavy mist hindered play
and in the latter part of the game the
green jerseys of the Fillers were in-I
distinguishable from those of Grin-
nell’s scarlet on account of the black
mud which fairly covered the gri -
sters. ‘ ‘

Start With Rush

The Pioneers started off with a rush
and after an exchange or punts. took
the ball to the Piker 10 yard line,‘
partly the result of a pretty twenty
two yards run around lett end brcapt.
Sweet. Four iine plays netted
the Scarlet and Black nine yards and
the Pikers tool: the hall on downs on
their own 1 yard line,

After a series of fumbles by hoth~
teams, Grinnell succeeded in reaching
the Washington 20 yard line but Meet-
er fumbled and Washington recovers
ed and punted out of danger, Gri -
nell punted back and the Filters piuge
ged the line without much success,
Malian got around left end for thirty
four yards but fumbled and Martin
recovered for Grinnell. liIeeter punt—
ed and Hayes. Filter quarterback re-
turned the bail forty yards to the
Grinnell 10 yard line The Pioneer
forward wall held and Gl-llinell took
the ball on downs as the hall ended

The third quarter was little more
than an exchange of pants in—
terspersed with frequent fumbles by
both teams. The Pikers had a slight
advantage in the distance of punts but
neither eleven could make any con-
sistent gains through the line.

Washington opened the last quarter
with a neat ‘30 yard run by Hays to
the Pioneer 20 y rd line. Two 'iine
smashes netted the southerners s
scant four yards and Levy attempted
a place kick hut McClain blocked the
kick and Gi'innell recovered Both
teams exchanged punts hut several
costly fumbles gave the Pihers the
hall on the Grinnell zll yard line, Afr
ter failing to puncture the line. Levy
stepped back to the thiry yard line
and hoted a place-kick for the only
score of the game on exchange of
punts which followed was of little
advantage to either team and the
game ended with the hall in Grin-
nell’s possession on her own 35 yard
line. .

Although the condition of the field
prevented any classy play by either
team, Martin and Meyer demonstrated
to the St, Louis fans that Grin‘nell has
a line worthy or recognition. in the
backfield Wing and Meeter showed
some of the class that has put them
among the pick of the valley hacks.
Capt. Sweet's ankle was in better
shape and he got started several
time for gains some what reminis-
cent or his play last year and the year
previous.

For the Pikers, Hayes and Levy

played strong games in the backfield.‘

Levy booted the oval in grant. style

and Hayes carried it several times

‘through a. broken field for

gains. Kziplan at guard and McCar—

roll at end looked best among- the

’Piker linesmen.
