The Gods Must be Crazy

by Kate Nosan

The God: Musl Be Crazy is
an all out farce, poking fun at
everything from the human con-
dition to documentaries about
nature. The director, Jamie Uyes,
milks the movie for all it is
worth, using such techniques as
absurd slapstick comedy and ever-
so~shallow political commentary.

We are first introduced to the
innocent, yet noble, Bushmen
tribe in the Kalahari Desert of
Botswana. An plane flying
overhead drops a Coke bottle into
tlleir camp. wreaking havoc upon
the normally peaceful tribe. Be-
lieving that the bottle was a gift
from the gods they decide that it
must be reiumed and they send
Xi, one of the tribesmen, to
throw it off the edge of the world.
We next encounter the bumbling
white people who are residents of
Botswana. We meet a clumsy

School Daze

by Sam Perlman

Spike Lee's 1987 ﬁlm School
Daze is an important work. not
for its lasting impact on the his-
tory of film making, but for the
issue that it brings to light:
racism within the black commu-
nity. There has been a long his-
tory of resentment and hatred for
llghter skinned blacks by their
darker skinned "brothers and sis-
ters." It is only in the most re-
cent past that this issue has been
addressed by persons of color.

The setting of the ﬁlm is a
mythical, Southern, traditionally
black college, based on Lee's own
experiences at Morehouse Col»
lege in Atlanta. The entire
movie takes place over homer
coming weekend and portrays the
ﬁghting going on between the
"'jigaboos' and the 'Fwannabcs
The fon'rler are the darker skinned
students who are pressuring the
administration of the school to
divest from South Africa and are
concerned with the larger issues
of world-wide racism. The latter
are the lightcrrskinncd, straight
haired students, whose primary
concern is the integrity of their

microbiologist, a schoolteacher
who left the city to find peace and
quiet only to find more problems
in the country; and the Super-
suavc tour guide, a true weasel if
there ever was one. Finally, add
in the Government officials and
tcn'orists running despotic gov-
ernments and staging a bloody
but inept Marxist coup. The
three plots become hilariously
entangled and chaos reigns from
Ihcn on.

The film has been criticized
for being patronizing to Black
Africa. I would tend to disagree.
The movie holds nothing sacred;
the human race in its entirety is
considered comical and worthy of
ridicule. The film is simple, in»
fcctious fun.

learn valuable lessons about what
it means to be black and educated.

The film is admittedly un-
even. It is sometimes a comedy,
sometimes a musical and at other
times a moving social drama. At
times, it attempLs to be all three.
The very successful hair sequence

with the women of the cast is.
one of those moments whereLee'

brings all of the aspects of the
film together. Most of the time,
however, the ﬁlm jumps around
between genres, which can be
annoying.

Despite its flaws, this is a
movie that should be seen, espe-
cially by people who are not
aware of the existence of the is-
sue it deals with. Lee should be
satisfied by the effect that this
film has had to expose and
generate discussion over this is-
sue that has long been suppressed
within the black community. It‘s
also worth it to see "Da Butt!"

SCARLET AND BLACK

Flepo Man

by Matthew Macho

cha Marl is a sick, offbeat
movie, the most fun had from
Hollywood for quite a while.
The flick stars Emelio Estcvez
and a cast of kooks, deviants,
wackos, hoodlums, and punk
rocker scum. The plot is right
out of the headlines of sleazy
newspaper tabloids -- a
lobotomizcd scientist drives all
over the country in a gold Dodge
Dart (heedless of signals or lartc
dividers-kinda like Ted Kennedy)
with radioactive alien carcasses in
the trunk. Open that sucker and
you‘re fried! The government
wants the car so bad they put this
REALLY nasty woman with a
Michael Jackson Glitter Glove in
charge of hunting it down. She
figures she'll put a reward out for
it so repo men will ﬁnd it if her
goon squad fails. Estcvcz, a
Ioalhcsome punk if there ever
was one, goes to work for the
repo men and gets involved in the
whole mess.

This simply doesn't do justice
to the sheer chaos contained
(barely) in this movie After the
opening credits, accompanied by
ajagged song from Iggy Pop, the
movie opens up into a bleak yet
fun journey through a modern
urban wasteland, complete, with
generic beer, soda and potato
chips. Watch for great Scenes
like the janitor's theory of time
and space (you win a prize if you
can ﬁgure it out), and bizarre re»
curring images such as the ever»
green car freshener ("There's one
in every car... you‘ll see), and of
course, generic foodr

While Repa Man is great fun
no matter what state you're in
while watching it, I'd recommend
getting hammered, particulary if
you've Seen it before (or rather,
can remember having seen it be—
fore). Suck down a bottle of
whiskey, sniff some glue and get
ready for cha Marl. It's eleven
o'clock-7dr: you know where your
caris']

Performances redeem The
Pope of Greenwich Village

by Brian Strause

When a ﬁlm's highlight rer
volves around a police man being
dosed with a horse laxative you
know Something is wrong Of
course, this tactic would be per
fectly suitable in Police
Academy, but in The Pope of
Greenwich Village it merely
provides comic relief from the
cliche and superﬁcial characters.
inﬂuenced by Martin Scorsese‘s
Mean Streets, Pope met its
doom before it ever started.
While masterfully shot, the
Scorsese film merely drew shalr
low pictures of Little Italy's least
desirable citizens. Pope offers
more of the same with a few
variillicnsl

The plot is based on the rela-
tionship of Charley (Mickey
Rourke) and his distant cousin,
Paulie (Eric Roberts). Charley is
a maitre d' at a swish Village
restaurant where he allows Paulie
to wait on tables. Ever the en-
trepreneur, Paulie nickel and
dimes his checks, eventually get-
ting both of them fired, This
episode should have led Charley
to conclude that his cousin is a
moron worthy of a leper colony.
But, of course, in Little Italy
blood is the paste that keeps the
community glued together On
this premise Charley continues to
fall prey to Paulie's dim-wilted
ideas. Charlie's girlfriend, Diane
(Daryl Hannah), sums up the sit-
uation when she tells him that
he's "one inch away from being a
good person," but he‘ll never
make that one inch leap with this
idea of "tribal loyalty" dragging
him down.

The film's only worth lies in
its actor's abilitics, but all too
often they are restricted by poor
writing and direction. At times
Mickey Rourke proves to be an
electrifying screen personality,
but he is never allowed to fly.
Unfortunately his character‘s vio-
lent reactions to Paulic's incomr
petencc (and his own stupidity for
going along with him) are not
backed with any real Substance.
Subsequently, be it the bashing
of a refrigerator or the pummclA
ing of a door, Rourkc‘s character
is reduced to the stereotype of the
angry ltalilin. This film proves
that an actor can only rise as high
as the script allows. The fiim
opens with the background of
Frank Sinatra's 'Sumtncr vVlnd."
Sinatra tS C‘r‘Cl'le‘tln mat Charley

aspires to: cool, I p. seductive

and smooth as velvet. Perhaps he
fits some of these characteristics,
but at a base level he remains a
two-bit hustler. Nonetheless, the
audience eventually assumes that
there must be something to
Charley otherwise why would the
beautiful Diane hang out with
him’.7

Daryl Hannah‘s Diane also
proves to have little substance,
but somehow she cannot be
blamed. It appears that she has
fallen victim to a misogynist din
rector. Virtually every scene in
which Diane appears she is either
undressed or in her leotards.
Contrasted with Charley and
Paulie, whose characters are re-
liant on their respective
wardrobes for their physical at—
traction, Diane's purpose is to get
the appropriate portion of the au—
dience hot by the ﬂashing of
some skin. Fortunately it is the
director Stuart Rosenberg who
ends up looking foolish for havr
ing resorted to such a pathetic use
of a breath-taking star.

Eric Robert's Paulie is per-
haps the film's most annoying
character. However, he is sup
posed to be pathetic, so in this

respect he did a good job. Overr ,

acted throughout, Paulie gener-
ally stands true to the Italian
stereotype. However, among his
non-stereotypical behaviors are
his need to urinate when scared
and his occasional androgynous
tendencies. His alleged androgr
y'ny could be an attempt to prove
that he is truly at ease with his
masculinity, but it is never made
clear.

The supporting actors all of-
fered worthwhile performances,

with Kenneth McMillan Standing ‘

out in his portrayal of a safe-
cracker looking for that big heist,
You see, his son is retarded, so
he needs the cash to pay the bills.
Needless to say, it is all very
touching. Geraldine Page also

logs in a ring performance as the .

alcoholic mother of a corrupt
cop. Her stern defense of her son
is the most dramatic scene in the
ﬁlm. Although out of place in
regard to the Scope of the film,
the strength of Page's perfor-
mance cannot be denied, while

the effectiveness of the director '

and the writer can be, for their

inability to allow the other char- ‘

actors to rise to their potential.
