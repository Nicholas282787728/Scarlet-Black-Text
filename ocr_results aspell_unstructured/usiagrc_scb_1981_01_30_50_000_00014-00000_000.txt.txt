Finding A Grinnell Domicile

Perhaps the most battling problem
facing the modern collegian is that of
finding a suitable domicile. These
words will serve as a practical guide in

’iinding and decorating your new
“home-away-tromrhome.” Here in
Grinnell, a broad spectrum of housing
is available. Snug dormitory rooms
abound on both North and South Camv
pus. Aﬁable “townie" landlords have
apartments in different stages of
decay, which they are happy to lease to
students oi all races, creeds, and erotic
preferences. These rural folks are quite
sophisticated and can be counted on to
wait until the last student has departed
beiore staging their Klan rallies. The
more eccentric students may opt to
erect a fully—equipped teepee on Mac
field. The possibility for domestic hay
piness at Grinnell is apparently quite
good.

OFF-CAMPUS Vs. THE DORMS:
Before I outline my plan for successlul
off—campus living, let me speak candid-
ly to those who have elected to live in
the dorms. There’s no need to bow your
head in shame, Mr. On-Campus Senior.
You are the one who is constantly sur-
rounded by the attractive freshman
women whom you crave. These comely
coeds may see you as a mature and
brooding iigure and invite you into their
rooms [or Clamato and Zweibacks.
You’ve always Wanted that South Cam-
pus loggia single (the soealled “Stud
Palace“); do you deserve such abuse
from the off-campous crowd? of course
not. Go about your business with digni-
ty.

Olf-campus living does seem to have

one deﬁnite advantage over dorm lite.
Let‘s say that you're feeling particular
ly insecure on a given day. Then on top
oi that, something humiliating happens
to you: your lover throws you over for
die hardware clerk; a stranger sets ﬁre
to your gym shorts. You feel outcast
and utterly alone, At a time like this,
it’s just you and your domicile against

'the world. Slinking back home, all of a
sudden your dorm room looks like a
barren and forbidding cell. At a time
like this, you need the calming in-
ﬁnance oi a spacious apartment,
someplace that feels more like a home.
You need a place that will give you suc-
cor. Granted, no oft-campus ﬂat will
throw its arms around you and say,
”It’s going to be all right. babe," but it
should at least be in your corner,

CHOOSING THE IDEAL OFF-
CAMFUS APARTMENT: Be patient on
this score. After one or more years in
the dorms, you will have the tendency
to grab the first place that looks better
than a Borneo Death Cell. Anything to
get ott the street. Relax. Choosing your
apartment is a major step. You want a
place with character. Sooner or later,
you'll iind a cozy little place to call
home. Before moving in, inquire about
your new neighbors. Will there be a lot
oi noise coming through the walls?

Remember, tombilike silence is not
always the ticket for the sensitive Off»
campus type. 0n the other hand, a
lamily ol demented southern»rock fans
next~door can be equally tormenting,
Find a little place where you can study
comlortably and entertain with gusto,
IS THE APARTMENT OVER-
PRICED? Ever since you were a small
child, your mom has told you two
things: 1. Don’t kneel down to inhale
bus exhaust fumes; 2. Keep the rent
down. This should be no problem here
in Grinnell, Iowa, where a month's rent
lor even the most luxurious apartment
oiten costs less than a night’s stay in the
Waikiki Hilton. So don't scrimp on this
area. Spend as much as you have to at
tain opulence. Why punish yourseli in a
one-room place, when {or $200 a month
you can have grandeur?
DECORATING THE 0FF~CAMPUS
APARTMENT: The student who is new
to the oil-campus “scene" olten asks,

Michael ﬂush

“Should 1 hire a decorator to setup my
new place!" They’re alraid that they’ll
be given highly publlclzed Bad Taste
awards it they attempt to decorate
themselves. This iear lS excessive. The
men who think up these awards have
never heard oi Grinnell. So trust your
own aesthetic sense tor balance and
volume and, it this tails, call in a prof.
Your apartment should be an extension
oi your personality; another way oi exs
pressing yourseli Don't be alrald to go
with overhead mirrors it tllls is “your
thing.” Arrange some throw pillows on
the tloor and set up a conversation pit,
but make sure you won't be the only one
who sets foot in there, Buy lots oi lush
hanging plants. These will help to mask
your lack oi iurniture and knickr
knacks. Follow your own instincts and
soon your ”pad” will begin to take on a
life of Its own. In no time at all, you'll be
enjoying the much-ballyhooed “off-
campus lifestyle. "
