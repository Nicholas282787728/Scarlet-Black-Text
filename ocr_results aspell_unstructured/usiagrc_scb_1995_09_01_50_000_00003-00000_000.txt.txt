Dear Editor and the Grinnell
College Community:

I had never really spent much
time contemplating why Pamela Fer—
guson was the president of Grinnell
College. I figured that her long aca-
demic background, strong personal
presentation, or her regular atten—
danceat many campus functions were
reasons enough for hetto hold such a
prestigious title. However, the rea—
son forFerguson's presidency became
blatantly clear the other day. While
I was reading the opening remarks in
the Grinnell College Sesquicenren-
nial appointment calendar, I realized
that the woman knows the exact
date of the creation of the world.

“The creation of the world fell
upon the entrance of the night pre»
ceding the [\Venty‘thll’d day ofOcto—
ber in the year of the Julian Calen—
dat, 710 [4004 B.C]," states Presi—
dent Ferguson in her opening note.
Amazing.

My friends and I conferred and
decided that if President Ferguson
said it, it must be true. Now we must
help spread this stunning new infor—
mation to the rest of the world.

I find it amazing that the cre—
ation of the world occurred on the
23rd of October and we don‘t even
celebrate it as a national (or world)
holiday. A day every year to reﬂect
the spontaneous appearance of this
third stone from the sun. Festivities,
to be held on Mac field, are being
planned for thisyear’spremierWorld
Creation Day party.

I must admit that I feel quite
betrayed by the scientific communi—
ty for duping me into thinking that
there are fossils that are three or four

million years old. How naive 1 was
before this last week. I hope that the
Grinnellschool ofscience will bethe
first to adopt a new curriculum con—
current With this informative ari—
nouricement.

With thefine academic training
I’ve received here at Grinnell, I felt
compelled to investigate this matter
further, yet I was unable to, since
president Ferguson failed to cite the
proper sources from which she ob«
tained her information.

With information like the exact
date of the creation of the world, I
think the college could make great
strides in the academic community
and surely receive a much larger en-
dowment than the current sum.

We should all feel very fortu—
nate to have President Ferguson at
Grinnell College, and we should use
our collective resources to further
investigate and enlighten the world
as to the exact date of our planet's
creation, If the 23rd of October is
truly the birthday of the world (and if
Ferguson said it, it must be true) then
we will soon begin to see the name
Pamela Ferguson next to the likes of
Darwin and Einstein.

Congratulations are definitely
in order to President Ferguson. If the
rest of this sesquicentennial year is as
momentous as this last week has been.
then this truly will be the best year in
the history of the college. It also
means that next year the Earth will
be 6,000 years old. Just wait for that
birthday party.

Last year the SGA Joint Board
approved amendments to our Stu—
dent Government’s constitution. I
believethatourcampusshould know
about these changes, specifically the
changes that affect the position of
SGA senator. TheJoint Board meet—
ings will now only be biweekly. This
time structure change will hopefully
encourage meetings that focus on
morein—depthdiscussionsratherthan
short meetings that focus on quick
approvals. Furthermore, Senators
will no longer be forced to simply sit
each week at the joint board meet<
ings and take minutes. One set of
minutes will be taken and mailed to
the Senators over the computer, at
which point they may add their own
comments or additional thoughts to
these base minutes. This change is
very important as it is designed to
allow and create more debate and
discussion during the joint board
meetings rather than focusing on
writing minutes.

There have also been changes
that will improve the communica—
tion between thestudents and SOA.
A first key improvement in commu—
nication is the fact that SGA will be
more active in Hall Councils. The

communication between the HC’s
and SGA has been improved, pro—
viding a better link for ideas and
concerns to be expressed. The role of
Senator is vital in this communica—
tion since it is the main link between
SGA and students. A second key
improvement in communication is
the fact that Senators will be more
active in the SGAstanding commit—
tees. Thesesmallerdiscussion groups
that focus on specific details provide
Senators more direct involvement.
This should help Senators realize that
they directly affect what is happen—
ing on campus and inﬂuence the
decisions that are made.

Thus, the SGAIoint Board Sen—
ator has become a more powerful and
effective position. Because of these
improvements, and because it is im»
portant that our student government
runs effectively and smoothly, I en—
courage people to run for SGAsena—
tor. SGA needs quality senatois to
help focus and direct our activities
and decisions during the coming year.
Statements of intent can be picked
up inthe SGA office and returned on
or before Monday, September 4.
Furthermore, I encourage all students
to vote during Senator elections on
Thursday, September 7. It is impore
tant that we voice our opinions about
how we want our school to run and
who we want to influence these deci«
sions.

Commentary . 3

In the Coffee?

BY DAN BUE'H'N'ER

I somehow managed to cmm
everything (or so I thought at the
time) I own into the back of my
parent’s minivan for the pilgrimage
back to Grinnell. I was looking for—
ward to this school year; 1 was ﬁnally
an upperclassman. Past the halfway
markl Little did I realize what was in
store for me.

I spent all of my first day back at
Grinnell uncramming the van, lug—
ging my stuff up to Main 3—thank
God for the elevatoreand trying to
cram it all into my little cubicle, the
dimensions of which hear an uncan—
ny resemblance to those of the back
of the van. Every fifteen minutes or
so, I would of course remember some
incredibly important item which I
knew to be sitting serenely at home.
My dartboard, for example. I have
six dam, but no dartboard. Imagine
what you can do to a picture of some—
one you despise on a boring after'
noon.

My unpacking done, I wrung out
my shirt and sat down to contem—
plate the Meats air conditioning.
There are at least a dozen a.c. units
withinview of my room, and all were
hummingbusily as sweat poured from
my forehead. At night, their cone
stant hum has proven to be quite a
distraction as I lie awake, sweating,
and imagine the (SB—degree—with—no
humidity interior of Meats.

1 then proceeded to spend all of
new student days camping out in the
publications building, mostly because
it’s air conditioned, but also because
1 can't tell SPARC “I changed my
mind—I don’t want to be editor any»
more.” After a frantic few clays of
organization, the 8&8 seemedready,
and I was looking forward to relaxing
with my friends for a few days before
classes really got going, maybe buy-
ing stock in State Street. Then I
bought my books.

It amazes me how much money
people—myselfincluded—willspend
on the implements of their own dee
struction. Several hundred dollars
went toward the acquisition of this
semester’s tomes of knowledge, in—
cluding eight volumes on the Amer.
ican revolutionary period. My dis—
may turned to horror as I leafed
through my newly acquired history
texts—2,706 pages of material. And
they don‘t even have pictures. My
instructorinanotherclassannounced
that we would finish all the reading
for the course before fall break, then
begin work on a final paper to be
presented before an open audience
in December. Do those two facts
terrify me? Profoundly. Add an intro
course and the time commitment to
this tag, and you’ve got the formula
to destroy a human being.

So if you see me at State Street
this semester, and I’m not mention
ing things like “fail." “suspension,"
“enforced leave," or “kill. kill,"
please buy me a drink.

I think I’m going to need it.
