Coach Obermiller had predicted that the Carleton
meet would be a pushover. But the situation was
looking bad when co—captain Frank Halley’s good
luck cap split in half and the Pioneers trailed going
into the diving events. Tom Helpenstell and: Norm
Zimmen—namwho no longer practice diving) took
second and first places respectively and put
Grinnell back into contention. But even after good
performances by Brian Jones, Bruce Jones, and
Greg Gomez, the Grinnell team was still losing
going into the final relay. It took a great effort'by
the two-yd. freestyle relay team of Dan Weber,
Bruce Pivar,,Bruce Jones, and Jeff Noble to give
Grinnell a 58-54 victory.

The following day the Pioneers went to St. John’s
in Minnesota for an eight-team meet which lasted
most of the day. while Greg Gomez was the only
Grinnell swimmer to take a first place in the finals
(100»yd. breaststroke), Dave Kapp, Frank Halleyv
Brian Jones, Bruce Jones, and Bruce Pivar had
good times and Grinnell was able to secure second
place in the total scoring. A powerhouse, St. John’s
won the meet (445 pts.) with Grinnell I299 pts.)
defeating the other strong schools: University of
Minn. at Duluth (2787, S. Dakota St, (265), St.
Thomas (118), N. Dakota (117), and Macalester
142). A tired Grinnell team travelled back to
Grinnell well satisfied with their weekend's
achievements.

On Tuesday night a depleted Pioneer team of only
seven swimmers went to Drake University for a
dual meet. Since the pool was new and Grinnell had
never swum competition in meters, school and pool
records were set in almost every event by the
Grinnell swimmers. Noble got three records; Kapp
and Bill Raynolds both set two and the entire team
had a fun time in the 68-35 swamping of the Drake
club.

This weekend the Pioneer swimmers, who seem
to spend all of their time on road trips. head for
Augustana for the Viking Olympics. This meet gives
Grinnell the chance to face its toughest conference
competition, an undefeated Lake Forest team.

The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat7
what better way to sum up the Fourth Annual
Miracle Relays. To have seen the Grinnell Pioneers
last Saturday one would have known the thrill of
victory. There were bright smiles, swimmers
racing all about, and congratulations being heaped
upon coach Peggy Riedesel.

To have seen the athletes from Wisconsin-
LaCrosse and South Dakota State one would have
known the agony of defeat. There were tearrfilled
eyes, exhausted women, and coaches consoling
their somber squad. Such were the emotions at the
Miracle Relays.

A talented Grinnell team slipped by an equally
talented S.D.S. team to retain the traveling trophy
symbolic of the Relays championship. As usual, the
meet was decided in the last event, the 400 free
relay. If S.D.S. won they would end up tied With the
Pioneers for the title. However, Lacrosse won the
race by .01 seconds only to be disqualified moments
later because an exuberant team member jumped
into the pool before the race had ended. This
allowed S.D.S. to win the event. but also allowed
Grinnell to place eighth instead of ninth.
Thus, Grinnell Won the meet by a mere point.

Some impressive performances were turned In by
the Pioneer women. Margo Wessner, Debbie
.lalowiec, Ginny Munoz, and Sheryl l-Iuntoon cap-
tured the 400 medley. Later, Wessner teamed with
Anne Six and Nancy Duteau to win the 300
backstroke. A meet record was set by Ginny Munoz,
Becky Chipman, Jalowiec, and Huntoon in the 200
free relay,

Personal bests were set by Ann Cleaver in the 100
fly and the 100 free, DuTeau in the 100 back, and
Munuz in the100 ﬂy. Last, but not least,Munoz set a
pool record in the SD fly.

DuTeau best summed up the team's feelings
about the meet. “We won. it was great."

Tomorrow, the swimmers travel to Ames to
compete in the state meet.

After last semester’s relatively
light preseason schedule, the
Volleyball club returned in
January prepared to play a more
complete schedule, and hopefully
to reach a peak in performance for
the two home tournaments
which are next on their schedule.
The players have a good deal of
potential yet to tap. The club is
improving with each tournament it
plays and improvement is exA
pected to continue through the two
upcoming home tournaments.
After Christmas break the men
returned to action in a tournament
in Kansas City after only four days
of practice. Needless to say, the
club did not make a very strong
showing. The tournament was B
competition, which is the lowest
level in the USVBA. The next
weekend, however, the club
traveled to Ames to play in a
tournament hosted by the 150
team. There, the tournament was
A level and the club made a much
stronger showing. The club played
four matches of two games each,
with each game being played to 11
points. Out of the eight games
played, the Club won two and was
soundly beaten only once, by lsu,
So, there is reason to be up
timistic this weekend. The tour-
nament here will be a conference
qualifier. Four other teams are
competing this Saturday, including
Western Illinois and Graceland.
For those who are unfamiliar with
volleyball,’ Graceland , is , a

perennial power. Last year they
finished second in the nation in the
small college division. They
defeated Ohio State, which placed
second in the NCAA finals, and had
two All Americans. If you want to
see what volleyball is about take a
trip to the PEG this Saturday and
watch Graceland perform its
volleyball magic.

The impossible dream:

female 8 male cagers win

by Laurie Cragg

The Grinnell women‘s basketball
team earned a 1-2 record in its last
three games.

Last Thursday the Pioneers lost
to William Penn’s JV team 79oz.
High scorers were sophomore Kim
Krutilla and ireshman Sarah
Brichlord Each had eight points.

Against Cornell the Pioneers
were more spirited. They came
away from the game with a
positive high, winning 63-31. Sarah
Brichford was again the high
scorer with 16 points. Marnie
Curran contributed to the scoring
with 13 points.

The win over Cornell did not
provide enough momentum,
however. as the women lost
Tuesday night to Marshalltown
Community College, 6046.

Optimistically, the team's depth
has improved. The scoring game is
more evenly distributed among
several players.

The standouts in these last few
games have been Sarah Brichford
and Renae Reese.

Coach Winkler commented on
Brichford, “Against Cornell she
played an aggressive game and
warranted praise for an out-
standing performance." Brichford
was also credited with several
steals

Turning to Captain Reese, her
shooting was consistent in the
Victory over Cornell and she looked
poised, “i felt good and at ease.
The team did a fine job in the
Cornell game. I figure we’ll maybe
have two or three more wins this
season,” she Said.

Both of these predicted wins will
depend on the women's imr
provements. They need tu work on
shooting percentages. Positioning
for rebounds is also a necessary
factor.

Most important. all of the losses

 

have been attributed to a third
quarter lag. Up until half-time the
women look strong and work
together. After the tenrminute half
time break their momentum is
broken, and this affects their
shooting considerably. It usually
takes live or ten minutes before
they start consistently contributing
points to the scoreboard.
Tomorrow the team travels to
play Luther College‘s JV and then

on to play Coe College on Saturday.

several leads, only to see them
wiped out. In the overtime,
Grinnell jumped out in front and
then held on for the narrow victory.

Forward Royal Shepard, who
paced the Pioneers' attack with 16
points, opinioned that Grinnell‘s
improved defensive effort was the
telling factor in the game. Senior
pivotman. Gunnar Thors, the
lormer New Trier West High
School (Illinois) superstar who
recently announced his intention of
trying out for the lcelandic
Olympic Basketball team in 1990,
noted that free throws also played
a crucial role. The Pioneers missed
13 freebies, but still outscored
Carleton 191 from the charity
stripe,
