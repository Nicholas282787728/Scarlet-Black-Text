is the day of the
Midwest conference Track arid
Field championships, an event
which promises to be one of the
outstanding meets of the current
season in the state of Iowa.
Nine champions are return—
ing to battle against stiffer
competition than Wm encoun-
tered last season at Carleton.
The ccntorenoe championship
seems to be a ldur way race
between defending champion
Iawrence, Carleton, Beloit. and
-GririnelL Any of these four
teams could .win the champion-
ship handily since depth and
balance is the deciding lactor.

Lawrence returns with another
powerful squad this year. Their
outstanding balance seems to be
the secret of their success since
they copped the trophy last year
without winning a single first
place. Prominent on’their squad
are two sprinters, Whitelow and
Huber, both place winners in last
year‘s meet.

Grinnell will again be the dark
horse. John Bonyata, recently
elected captain of the Pioneer
thinclads, is the defending chain»
pion in the 100 and 220 yard
dashes. Greg Newell will defend
his 120 high hurdle title, stove
_Hitchcor:k, a place winner last
year, is also expected to be a
point»winning factor in the
sprints, Naturally. Grinnell'sfam-
ed one mile relay team, the Dralre
Relays champion. is one of the
favorites in that event.

Carleton will have perhaps the
most powerful team on the field
with depth the only question
mark, They have in their ranks
one defending champion in Ger-
ald Sheen, the 220 low_hurdie
champ. Shean is also adept at
the high barriers and the high
jump. Crane is a vastly improved
hurdier and is expected to give
Neweli a hard time in the highs.
sandberg has jumped higher than
anyone else in the conference
thus far this season, and is a

def e threat that event

Beloit seems to be the only
mystery team among the favor-
ites. It is known that they have
an excellent team and that they
beat Lawrence in a dual meet
earlier in the season. Ralph Hal-
;berstadt is the defending champi-
on pole vaulter and is expected to
repeat, Beloit's mile relay team
is better than average and will
have a good chance to cop that
event. Reynolds is perhaps the
best broad jumper in the confer-
ence along with Zamzow of
Ripon,

Cornell and Coe are bringing
comparatively weak teams and
should rarik below the four fav-
orites. McKay of Coe in the shot‘
put, and Ben McAdam of Corr
nell in the two-mile run are re-
turning champions, M c A d a m
should do well in the mile run,
too. Coe's mile relay team, who,
defeated ’Grlnnell’s team in last
week’s triangular, is definitely ai
threat in that event.

Knox and Monmouth, although
not,contenders for the title, have
individuals which could easily
effect the outcome of the final
standings. Hugh DeMorest of
Monmouth will defend his 440
yard dash title, and is expected
to do so successfully. Monmouthi

has an excellent hurdier in Krul-
denier. Monmouth. anchored by

champion DeMorest. has a mile
relay team. which has scored a,’
number of impressive victories.
Knox’s ace trackman is Wallmani
who would be a top contender
in the discus and jevelin throws.

Ripon although few in number.
may annex the most individual
titles due to the efforts of the
great Earl Zamzow. the defend-
ing high jump champion. de<
zuw, Ripon's one man team, is
an excellent pole vaulter and has
recorded the best broad jump
to date in the conference. He
may be the outstanding individual.

Track, Tennis,
Golf Teams Cet
Triple Victory

Grinneli's athletic teams turn-
cd in one of their most profitable
performances of the year over
the weekend with victory in a
triangular track meet over Cor-
nell and Coo, along with the
winning ways of the golf and
tennis teams, who defeated Coe,

With Douma, Wilson, and

Peisner as returning lettermen,
the Pioneer tennis team was de-
feated by Coe in only one of six
matches, Douma, Pedersen, Hall.
and Wilson won their individual
matches, while Peisner and Fed—
ersen proved to be too strong
for their opponents in the
doubles set.

Paced by Jack Thellman's
blistering 71, Grimell's golfers
soundly defeated Coe ll to 1.
Every Pioneer golfer had a score
lower than his opponent, but
Dates match was the closest,
as he finished only one stroke
ahead of his rival. The two other
victories were gained by Smith,

off his former meet marko

strated liis versatility by capping:
second place in both the pole‘
Vault. and the broad jump. l

other important point-makers,
for the Pioneers were SouLh-‘
vtvorth and Davis who placed sec-
onds in the shot put and discusw

 

who shot an 81, and Jacobson
who had 35 strokes marke
against him. ,
Led by Bonyam's first placesl
in the mo and 220 yard dashes,l
coupled with defending champ:
Newell's twin triumphs in the}
two hurdle events, Grinnell's‘
thinclads were able to outscore
Cornell and Coe with a total of
63% points to 5999 and 44,
points respectively for the op-
ponents. Bunyata‘s 9.9 century
clipped two tenths of a second
