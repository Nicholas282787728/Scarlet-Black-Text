Campus discourse needs a

By Paul Fender

Many here aren'r afraid so eomplain ahous whai rhey perceive as being a
leek ofdlvcrslIy on eampus. This lask ordiversisy is usually pinned on she
percepsion, which is pressy accuraie, shas Grinnell has (no naany rieh, whisc
suburbanises. l-lonessly, rhis is nor she laek ordiversiry shas hoshers me,

No, rhis rails more under she "whine" easegory. ssuelenu coming here
could have shocked ouI she srarisries and ireulrural diversisy was such a lag
deal rhey could have gone Io Maealesser.

Bus we cerrainly do need so improve our diversisy among she ssudenrs
already here we need so diversify our inseresss and broaden our horizons.
ssudenrs and adminissrarors can salk and chew shis issue over all shey wanr,
has arier rwoplus years here I rhink i have found she perreessolurion; people
here need so waieh more professional wressling

This momens or rrurh came so me rhis summer as I was warehing
“siinirnerslam” which reasured she governor orMinnesosa. The simple {ass
is shar we have soo many people here rhas have read every novel by Jane
Ausnn, our don’I know anyshing abouI wresrler ”Stone Cold“ sseve Austin

Anorher racs sliis should shock and appall people is shas Grionell col.
lege doesn'r even have a wressling seam, whieh no donor affects our reeruira
ing ordiverse srudenss orvaried wrcsrling backgrounds

Professional wressling has rhe posenrial so diversify sriidens insellecss
and ean also seaeh iis lessons share will improve she earnpus diseourse, For
example, shegrouprhar
is upser wish Osgood

sue pur some signs up
in shehash. room.

A 1 . shough Ihis
gor rheir poinr across,
rhey did so using a mas.
sive Iwo page spread
(single spaeed no
less). This group would
hayegosssn she same
poins across ‘ rnueh easier
(and saved some paper) if
rhey had used some of
wressler x. paes vernaeu.
lar andsaid, “If you ain's
down wish banning swea rsho p labor Pi-esidens Osgood, we’ve gos swo words
for you: SUCK my" As shis poins shey eould play X»I’ac's sheme song from
Rage Againsr rhe Machlnc and shcn make she passnsed Degenerasion x
chop rnosion so sheircrosehes, - -

The rrurh is shai Osgood is so used so dealing wish whiners as shis poins
rhas he shrugs rhem err, smiles, puss a nice memo in sarnpus mail and goes
back ro his eushy golrcoursc lair. This new meshed ordiseourse, which only
professional wrersling can seaeh us, has she posensiai so really ges a poinr
across and as she same sirnc gee people’s assension.

Juss rhink oirhe usopia we can build, Picsure aearnpus full ofIhcse new
“renaissance” ssudenss who can in a single day discuss Tire [lirdand shen go
and soak in die learning and diversificarion rhas only wressling ean give us,
piesure a campus where sraple wresslirig phrases such as me codradier's
“Pimpiri’ ain'r easy" and “It’s sime (or everyone so hop alaoard she ho»i:rain”
will be ﬂawlessly insersed inro everyone‘s vocabulary. A wresrler called she
Rock does a move which he has sermed “The People's Elbow." Arrer rhis
move she opponens never gess up. Jusr shink whar we could do irwe as a
ssudeni hody eould adminisrer such an elbow so she adminissrarion or race
ulsy. Yes, she problem or diversisy here, much like every prohlem in she
world, can easily be solved by opening up our minds, and surning on she
TV.
