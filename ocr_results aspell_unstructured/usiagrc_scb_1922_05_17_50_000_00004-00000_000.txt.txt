American Legion’s 'Annual
Musical Comedy.

"The Jellies or 1922," as presented
by the boys or the Focbt-Tennant
post, American Legion at tho Colo—
niill theater last night, kept close to
a' capacity audience about equally di-
‘t'itleil between laughter and applitllsc.
it was easily the best show the Legion
has presented here. The show open-
ed with the regulation ministrel show
land closed with a musical comedy
haiing about as much plot as most
musical comedies have. one of the
specialties that was especially good
was the rlora'dcra Sextette.

Oscal Mathews opened the per-toi-
mance by introducing the harmonists
and end nien Carl Johnson, Loren
Moor-head, Homer Dawkins, Everett
Norelius, John Jacobsen. and Alex
Robb. Thesomen were all on to their
job and brought down the house with
their jokes. Carl Johnson made an
especial hit with the audience in his
solo "Georgia."

The ﬁnale to the ﬁrst part was glv-
en a clever touch by distributing tam—
bourines tbrn the audience and invite

with the people on the stage.
The scene or the second part was
laid in a union station. Among those

“J‘L ‘ NIGH' s is A JKARROOJI"

Probably few, if any, printed or ftctr
ed stories have cdllsetl mole lumps to
arise in threats, or iurtivc wiping
away of tears, than “Ten ngllts in a
Bhrroom.” Our fathers and mothers,
grandfathers and grandmothers, to the
number of probably millions, read it
and went to see it, And now that the
grant story has been filmed, they will
so once more and take the children
and grandchildren with them, to syiu.
pathize again with the weaknesses of
poor Joe Morgan, to be stired to
heights of anger by the plotting of Sie
mon Slade and Harvey Green, to
weep over the sad death of little Mary,
and to laugh over the small-town
comedy antics of sample Surtchell and
his romantic llehitahle. The very
title. "Ten Nights in a Bari-coin." stirs
up memories of laughter and tears
long forgotten.

Let it not be thought that the ﬁlm
version of this famous story is pro-
hibition propaganda. Far from it The
lesson is there~an<l more strongly
than it ever was in book form or on
the spoken stage~ but the pictui
tiou is a strong, well acted play 01‘
family lire in a small town and is
teaming with appeal to the scntl-

ments or father love and mother love. \

Points of View.

“In a word, it college is an institu-

ers for the world," said Prof. Ryan]
at senior chapel on Friday morning. I
in giving a review of the fnudumcn- .

tul ideals of a college course Prof.

Ryan presented the purpose of a colrl
logo from an institutional, a personal:

and a philosophical view point. "Flam
an institutional view-point college is
but one cog in the wheel. It is but

one element in all our education froml

the kindergarten to the university,
“stated the speaker. "Formal instruc-
tion ends for some who must drop
out after their four years spent inE
Grinnell but their education will notl
cease because education only ends
with life itself,—and maybe not then.”
The speaker brought to mind the
t that Grinnell as an institution
is a religious cog in the wheel of ear
ucation and that we should always
think or her as such. Furthermore.
we as Grinnellians, must not forget
our allegiance to our flag, ﬁrst, last
and always.

The second \iew point continued
the speaker, is the personal view
point which ‘is the expression of op-
portunity, the symbol of a many side
ed truth. The personal view point
teaches the student to labe‘ advantage
of every opportunity, to dud an op-
portunity worth while and to dcvelopl
it once it is realized.

Grinnell lcallzes her philosophical
institutionalism in the fact that she
compels every one to take physical
training. “Your health Pro(. Ryan
said in concluding, is the most impor-
tant thing you can get in lite for ll
you have good health you can be help-
ml to others and when you can be
helpful to others you should be happy
and to be happy is to be in heuv.en
