Chinese Puzzle - -

For those whose interest ill the Chinese
nation and its gallant struggle has been as
great as their interest in the ‘New World
of Tomorrow,’ recent developments ill the
intemal affairs of that Far Eastern state
do not make nice reading.

We have been accustomed to thinking
of the Chinese as a mass of intrinsically
good, historically underprivileged, politic—
ally inept people, much imposed upon by
the harsh circumstances of modern imper-
ialism in general and Japanese aggression
in particular. We like them. Generally
speaking, they have seemed to like us7
perhaps our part in the economic conniv-
ing with which they have been beset for
centuries has been slight enough to warrant
their trust. And so, our historical relations
have been mainly friendly7especially since
our military assistance has caught up with
the ‘moral support’ we had been preach-
ing but doing nothing about ill the decade
between 1931 and Pearl Harbor.

At least we are on the scene, doing
something. We are also learning some-
thing. That lesson is what has come out
of the news dispatches from China in the
last month

As has been said before, we Americans
(as all occidentals) have thought of the
Chinese as a mass—physically they are
rather indistinguishable to us; politically
and economically they seemed bound to—
gether by common misfortune. We talked

M the Chinese problem as though there ‘ illents for the representations of minorities.

were only one problem, and were confident
that one solution would be sufficient ‘Beat
the Japs7drive 'em out of China’—that
was the answerl

But is it?
To the immediate problem of Chinese

preservation, yes, But to the continuing
problem of Chinese future, perhaps not.

It seems that the Chinese are not an
indissoluble mass. There are such things
as factions in China. There are even such
things as factions in that group which to
us has represented China in quotation
marks: the Soong family.

The faction split became apparent with
the announcement by Madame Sun Yat-Sen,
widow of the founder of the Chinese re
public (and eldest of the Soong daughters),
of a program for China which, largely
reiterating the doctrines of her dead hus—
band, nevertheless appears highly tinged

with Communist pink. The Generallisilno :are going to come out of this as

is not fond of Communists7and the lines
appear to be drawn between him (with his
Kuomintang followers) and the Chinese
communists. A more pessimistic view
would be to call the split one of reaction
vs. liberalism.

,it seems that the guiding principle with
i\\'l‘licl1 any proposed solution must be jusr

,government which is honestly chosen by

- others The only sensible Chinese post-wari

 

Such news dispatches as we have had‘
have not been comprehensive or partic-
ularly lucid. But the split is there7what
is more, it has every indication of being
there, wider than ever, when the war is
over.

Americans are being forced into the
realization once again that all is not going
to be clear sailing when the last shot is‘
fired. Victory over the Japanese, rather
than insuring China the proverbial ‘happy
ending’ may instead remove the last check
7namely common danger—which has thus
far prevented the Chinese from a faction;
war. At best the situation is going to he‘
touchy, and at worst it may wait for,
Victory day before it breaks. \

How does this concern us? First our
‘stake‘ in the war has been largel in the
Pacific area. It was in the Paci c that
our part of the conflict began—and no
amount of government statement about
‘finishing Hitler first’ has made the ma
joxlty of American people take their minds
off the day Bataan is to be avenged Sec-
ond, it is apparent that if a system of
world order is promoted after the peace,
our job of ‘enforcing’ that order will be
ill the Pacific. Third, internal dissatisfac-
tion in post-wai- China would be an open‘
invitation to the relaunching of imperial—
istic moves by many powers within her
territory—at best, making our job of guar-
anteeing security more difficult; at worst
drawing us into war again or if we would
not go to war, breaking down the whole
idea of ‘world order‘. Fourth, our ally,
Russia, despite all its ‘moves to the right’
is still the figurehead of Communism.

Are we going to let the Chinese figurel
out their own internal problems7even if
the process means internal wart7 Are we
going to offend Russia by backing the‘
Chinese conservatives or frighten our own
conservatives by backing the Communists?
Are our promises about ‘allowing every
people the right of choosing their own gov-
ernment’ going to prove empty?L Or is
our dream of world order to go up in
smoked7

We don‘t have the answer.
no one person has the answel.

Probably
And yet

tified is just that highrsounding one which
we quoted a moment ago in a spirit of
frank cynicism; namely ‘the right of every
people to choose their own government’.
This is not idealism-with-a-capitalrI. This
is an attempt at common sense. For that

l

the people governed will make arrange-

Political ‘minorlties’ are the real Chi—
nese problem, We, with our mistaken idea
of the Chinese ‘mass’ have perhaps lost
sight of the fact of minorities in China.
The communists are a minority ill some
areas, the Kuomintang is a minority ill

government will include both. If it does,‘
there is information to support the belief
that neither group will indulge in separ—
atism or civil war. If it does not, ‘Peace'
will be a word of little meaning ill the
far East.

It seems that the role of the United
States in China will be to exercise what—1
ever influence it has with the present rec-1
ognized leaders to guarantee the estab~
lishment of such a liberal regime after
the warl Our influence will not be small;l
but, at the same time, we must realize
that it will be mandatory. With lllck we
‘One
\Vorld'—but that does not mean an Amer-
ican world, or a Chinese, or a Russian. The
realization of the meaning of cooperation
and coresponsibility has only begun to
dawn upon us. China may well be the
‘test case}

Has Grinnell affected anyone's
