Perhaps, this isn‘t u'ar according to the

DRESSING 'FOR DINNER

Ill the past there has been a tradition at
Gl-inllell which required that each man wear
a coat and tie to dinner. Of late, however, this
tradition has been sadly neglected find every
sort of dress has been seen ill the dining room

The result has been that the evening meal
instead of being a dignified occasion is just
another meal.

Undoubtedly the tradition of so called
“dressing for dinner” is more than an empty
action and does tend to acquaint the men with
the necessity of conducting themselves more
like gentlemen. To slip on a coat and ii tic is
no hardship, nothing comparable to “dressing
for dinner” in the accepted sense of the word,
and it lends a dignity to the evening meal that
is found at no other time.

This dignity is part of the Grinncll 1radi~
lion and is something worthy of keeping. How-
ever, it can only be maintained by each find
every man helping to carry on the tradition of
“ dressing fOI‘ dinner, ”

in every proverb. It is equally true that there
are few, if any, proverbs which are without ex<

among college men; and, cynical though it may be,
one must admit that it contains much truth It is
that “it is not what you know, but whom you know,
that lend: to Success.” Some of us young people
who have at. some time hunted for work in the lest
few years know how true this is. Fortunately it
is also certain that unless he knows his business at
least fairly well, he will sooner or later be rev
placed by a man who does. “Man shall not live
