0 For Work Well Done.

Fourteen years ago Sara Sherman Pryor
came 'to Grinnell to assist in the formation
of a department of drama. To Mrs. Pryor,
creative art, whether in music, painting,
vriting, or drama, was inseparably linked
ulth life, and consequently should be an in-
tegral palt of education. She dedicated helu
self wholeheartedly to the achievement of
this ideal in her department.

Under Mrs. Pryor the department of
drama at Grinnell College has risen to a
position of nation wide prestige. Nearly
every year requests are received for pic-
tures and displays of Grinnell dramatic pro—
ductions. Nine original plays written here
have, or are about to be, published. The pro-
ductions given at the college have consist—
ently been characterized not only by out-
standing selections and finished, almost pro-

fessional performances, but have given stu-
dents experience in nearly every phase of
theater work, from lighting, costnming, and
management of properties to designing of
sets and directing of casts, Trained teachers
in play production, and qualified workers in
nearly every branch of theater work have
gone out from Grinnell and have returned
practically unanimously glowing tributes to
the exacting and uncompromising standards
she set for them here at Grinncll.

Next year will be the first time since
1928 that Mrs. Pryor will not be at Grinnell.
No one can deny that she has certainly
earned a. year of rest. In spite of the limited
material often at her disposal, she has collr
tinned resolutely carrying out the ideal she
initiated fourteen years ago. In spite of
adverse conditions, we hope the years ahead
will see no wavering or gradual extinction
01' that ideal.

@ It Means Everybody.

Three years ago, John Lemplie \l‘tls all Eng,
lish instructor at Grillnell. He was a fine,
sensitive, nsthetic mall, hating war, and all
the violence and brutality that war brings.

Yet, only a few were] ago, John Lemplie
was manning an anti-aircraft gun on Ba-
taan peninsula, which has since fallen to
the enemy.

No word has been heard from him since
the surrender. Perhaps he has been captun
ed, perhaps he is dead.

This example only serves to bring closer
the meaning of “total war." A War that not
only includes the héll‘tlrblttell, leather-necked
soldier, but artists, dreamers, musicians, wo—
men, childrcn, you and us.

Lempke has done what we must doisub-
ordinate our aspirations, our talents, our
emotions to the total war effort. We must
add all that we have as John Lempke has
done.
