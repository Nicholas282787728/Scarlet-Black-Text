COEDS AND CHIVALRY

In various colleges and universities l'ecclltll'.
the question ”Is chivalry disappearing on the
campus?” is hoing discussed by women simultanr
cously with the, question, ”‘l'llat makes a man an
eligible date ”

All Omaha newspaper this week printed on
article concerning the University of Nchllslill oocds’
views as to whether the Nebraska Ill‘en students
are discourteous. The majority View was that they
were, and the coeds were discolnllloded by the foot.

As in every question, there is here “much to
be said on both sides.” For some time, men’s atr
telltion to counesy has lleen growing more lax
us more and more women have begun to meet them
on their own footing as fellow-workers in campus
oganizations as well as in the position of “sweet-
hearts”.

To the girl who is his avowed ehoi of ll
“date,” the average mall apparently wishes 'to
Sh0\\‘l 23. studied courtesy. However, he associated
with many girls in other capacities thon"‘dotes,”
and then both man and maid are apt to be rather
“hail fellow well met," and the girl does the acts
for herself that, if the mall ‘were 2t “date” She
would insist that he do,

Ill some Such way, the effect of cloml'adesllip
rather than sweetheartship between
and women has levelled down courtesies ill one in-
stance, and, consequently, llccnusc men and women
are more or loss creatures of habit. is beginning to
pervade the whole social atmosphere. it such is
the case, then the women are equally to blame for
the disappearance of chivalry. lf ‘rt woman does
not demand courtesy from men then the latter, by
the law of human nature, will follow the path of
least resistance mid let courtesy “go hy the
hoar< .”

If women desire the return of chivalry among
their escorts then they must demand it at 211] times
and the men must return to their former (‘lliVElll'lC

STUDENT VAGABONDING
(From the Industrial Collegirur)

Northwestern university has instituted an excellent
new plan, which it shamelessly admits it took from
Harvard, and which it calls “strident vagabonding,"

Each week the Northwestern Daily publishes a list
of worthwhile lectures to be given in regular classA
room routine by professors on the campus. When it
is possible the paper will also publish the subject of
the lecture,

Students are encouraged to attend these lectures
if they so desire. They will receive no credit for atteuclr
once. they listen to them for their own pleasure and
their action is purely voluntary. They are not required
to remain if the lecture proves less interesting than
they have anticipated.

The second part of the plan includes a criticism
each week of the outstanding lectures given by the
instructors. This criticism is written by students from
a student viewpoint and is meant to be constructive
and helpful.

A “student vagabonding“ plan is helpful both‘ to
instructors and to students. Helpful to students because
they can acquire information in a field to which they
cannot devote an entire term; helpful to faculty mem-
bers because they’may popularize their subjects. .

"Student vagabonding" would undoubtedly make
for more interesting lectures on the whole, and. while
it would be much more easily carried out in a large
school such as Northwestern, it would be well worth
attempting here at state college,

STUDENTS AND BOOKS
(From the Marquette Tribune

“It's in the book."

For many university students this answer settles
the questions of the world. It is their final proof, and
as far as they are concerned, the teacher exercises no
right to interfere with its jurisdiction. They stand or fall
by their book.

But from a recent graduate engineer comes
statement that one of the most difficult tasks he
had since leaving college has been "unlut‘Ting” the
text book's idea. Students are prone to overlook the
human element that enters not only in the writing of
the text but even in its selection, They regard’ivt as in~
fallihle doctrine, especially if the teacher disagrees with
it in some particular.

Their idea of a university course seems to be that
of transferring to the brain all the facts and formula
set forth in texts, They disregard the relative worth of
the texts and study them only superficially. Students
are after knowledge, not intelligence nor education. If
given the opportunity, professors would he only too
eager to destroy this misconception. Habits of logical
thought are more valuable than facility in repetition
of facts,

Facts, of course, have a place in individual cultir
vation. They represent truth, But, like gold, truth must
be separated from the dross.

FIVE-DOLLAR GLASSES—
(Frenr the Cornellian)

About ten years ago the faculty voted to impose
on students a fine of five dollars for eutting the last
meeting before and the first meeting after a vacation of
each class, regardless of the day on which each class
met.

the
hats

Thus it is possible in certain onehour courses to' . ‘

have four out of five class meetings worth $20, nega-
tively, to the student. In two or three hour courses,
one must be continually worried for a week before and
after a vacation about for-getting or legitimately cutting
any ela . If o eut occurs, much trouble is occasioned.
If one has been ill, excuses must be dug up. Over-sleeping
must be Justified. Abscntmiudcdrlcss must be e. ilniner:
Absence musL be petitioned of a harried faculty corri-
mittco. All this to the mutual inconvenience of the
rulerllound student and the busy r rtlcr of attendance.

Must there be so much icstri ion? '

Half can be dispensed with. Certainly, there must
he some check on the student who is overall ious to
return to the parental fireside. But enough i. enough,
espe‘eiallv whim any form of outside restraint of itself
arouses instinctive sntego

Criginnlly, This rule we do good to apply only
to the last and first days of classes, not to the f at
flnd lost classes. But it snarl in the red tape of giving
the ruling its official verbiage lent its present signifi-
cance.

The [ivordollar finc would be as effective, with u
very few negligible exceptions, and half as bothersome,
if limited to the last day of classes, The student od-
visol‘y council can revise this overramhitiolls rule by
petition to the faculty, who reeognize the need of re-
vision.
