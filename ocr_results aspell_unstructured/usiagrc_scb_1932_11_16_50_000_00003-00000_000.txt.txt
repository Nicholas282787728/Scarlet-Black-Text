Annual Burning of Old Shoe Tonight

Outcome of Last Tilt Based
,on C ,pﬁainfs Aim-— i

Superstition

Any old shoe will do the trick. To-

night will be the final football prac-
ice session of the Pioneers’ 1932
season, and with it will come the
tradi onal custom of burning an old
cleated shoe.

A large shoe with the feeting ca—
pacity similar to Bob Morgan's is es—
pecially desired in order to make the
most of the superstition. A large bon-
fire is built behind the south goal
post on Ward field and the captain
of the grid team tosses the shoe over
the crossbar,

If the shoe falls into are fire, so

of Iowa football fans, Hank Dun-,of the season will be won; and if the
can reported for duty and became the,shoe misses the flames it is a con-

hest end in the state during the'
course of the season, 'despite the facti
that he had never played football bet
fore in his life. His development was
nothing short of miraculous; he scor~
ed two touchdowns in‘the season‘s
opener; he continued to snag passes‘
throughout the season to amass‘
enough points to give him the Com
ference championship in individual
scoring even though he never carried
the ball from scrimmage. An all
Valley and allrstate end, Duncan will

be sorely missed next year,

Four other seniors will probably:

the most, and has prnctirniliy cinched ,
his letter. Bowiby played an excellent.
game against Creighton for thc cn~
tire sixty minutes and is a very like-
ly smarter against the Aggies.

Ulllich's splendid all-around worlr,
Craflund's fine defensive play,
James’ shifty openfield running and
accurate passing, Martin's and Figs
land's dependable work at the
guards, and Duncan‘s ability to catch
passes will leave a place {or many
new faces next year. To take away
so many fine players at once is:
enough to dishearten any coach, butl
Watt has no reason to be gloomy, for'
he has a number of good men ready
to step into the breach.

idered cinch to lose the game.

This superstition has dated back
to the real Pioneers of Grinnell col—
lege. It is supposed to be an official
farewell ceremony to the senior
members of the team, but no one
seems to recall how the custom
started, or how often it has predicted
the score of the final game.

Coach Lester Watt, who starred as
quarterback on the Crinncll team in
1917, recalls that the shoe was heaved

,across the her before his final game.
”When the custom first started, no
,one knows.

rights to women were stressed by
Mrs. T. stromston, state president of
the League of Women Voters, in
speaking before the Grinnell group,
at a dinner in the quadrangle Tues:
day night.

“To do this, women must be edu—
cated to demand the legislation nee»:
essary and to demand places in the
government", stated Mrs. stromston.3
‘She closed her discussion by expiain—‘
ing the great opportunities open fort
women in the pol cal field, if they
would make the attempt.

Mrs. J. R. Farkes, secretary of the
fifth region of the national league.
followed Mrs. Stromston’s discussion
with an explanation of the league’s
program for the year which will i -
clude constructive economy in governr
ment; international cooperation, and
the prevention and relief of unem-
ployment,

Mrs. Parkes stressed particularly
