Hypocrisy

We look at ourselves too often, Ask
your tamer about the taxes he paid to
support the vietnam War. Ask your
mother about the success of the War on
Poverty. Ask your grandparents about
Prohibition and the morality 01’ the hip
flask. Ask anyone about the joys ol
hypocrisy. They will tell you the truth

Hypocrisy is subtly pleasurable As 1

starving to death. I barely make
enough money to keep gas in my car.

rightfully mine.

Some thoughts for the trustees

1) You have done an excellent job in
losteriiig the values of human rights by
initiating the Rosenfield Program: Why
not turn theory into practice? How
about setting up a stronger program [or
recruiting black students? Not only will
this further the educational oppor
tunities oi the Grinnell community by

. adding diversity but it will allow Grin-
nell to move in a growm area in student
recruitment at a time when overall

. recruiting opportunities are declining.

- Moreover, if affirmative action should

' take place in this society, it is at
the level of the liberal arLs college and
before that it should take place. it
would be invidinus discrimination to
have the black community served by
professionals and technicians less com-
petent than society as a whole. Grinnell
is the kind of place that otters those peo-
ple denied equality of condition in the
past a chance to catch up.

2) The Grinnell yearbook is caught in
a "catch 22" situation. The marginal
cost of the book declines rapidly after a
high fixed cost. The editor needs to sell
a large number of books to keep the per
unit cost down but few people will buy it
at a high price. Therefore, few people

hypocrites are not always happy and
untroubled. We worry about whales and
abortion; some at us are even seen in

pensive Why don‘t you add the cost oi
one yearbook lor each senior averaged
over the entire student body to the ac
tivities l’ee'! With a large bulk of orders
to begin with the yearbook would have a
chance to lower the price while adding
to quality, thus increasing sales and
decreasing cost overall Given the
relatively high cost 01 a Grinnell educa-
tion. I doubt the elasticity of demand is
great enough to lose any students over a

faltering campus activity fund. make
the yearbook more etficient and, who
knows. maybe it will aid recruiting
when our children are deciding on
which college to attend.

3) Grinnell has long had an active
role in public affairs. I belive it had the
first or one of the first departments of
political science. Harry Hopkins is one
of Grinnell's most famous graduates.
Why not create a Hopkins Chair of
Political Science" Such a move would

47 The success at Grinnell‘s invest
ment program has been nothing short
of magnificent I would be the first to
argue that your tlrst responsibility is to
keep Grinnell financially sound. I would
also agree with Mr Crosby that most
proxy resolutions are unworkably
designed. I do suggest. however, that
instead of crazy divestment schemes,
students, iaculty and trustees could
make some effort to design workable
resolutions and vote for those resolus
tlons which are workable. Further. why
aren't my polite, bordering on obse-
quious letters on this subject ever

5t i realize that the "inmates' don't
necessarily know how to run the institur
hon but have you given any thought to
having a student liaison to the trustees?
ithink some students are now responsr
ble enough to do the Job and it would
help you to have a student perspective
Further, such participation would ens
courage students to think beyond their
