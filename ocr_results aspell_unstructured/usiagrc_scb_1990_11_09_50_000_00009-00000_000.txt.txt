Highlights New Film Club

By Jennifer Manes

“I’ve always thought it was to-
ally strange that Grinncll has no
film club," Chris Snyder come
merited. He consequently decided
to establish his own organization
on eampuslhissemester. The group,
which has 27 members, meets at 9
p.m. every Monday in ARH 120.
The group primarily serves as an
outlet forstutlcntvideoproduction.
Snyder said he was prompted to
form the group. which he presides
over and organizesJJy a friend who
belongs to a similar club at
Dartmouth.

Snyder, who has a strong per-
sonal interest in video production
and broadcasting. said that club
members are now collaborating on
a script titled “Slahouey,” which
will later be ﬁlmed with video
cameras available from the Audio
Visual Center in ARH.

“All the resources [for the club]
that exist right now are video
equipment in the A-V Center," said
Snyder, He added that laterawhole
editing room will be madeavailable
for the club‘s use sometime in the
near future.

The idea for “Slahooey” origi»

nated from a “pink elephant" joke,
“the type of joke that runs on for-
ever and has a stupid ending,” ex-
plained Snyder. “It‘s really a
mystery. it‘s really offbeat and
really artsy in that it has a surprise
ending."

Freshman Paul Kuipe will star
in the production. which will most
likely be screened for the entire
campus upon its completion.

Snyder said that many club
members have previous film or
video experience, or want to get
experience in that area.

“There'salotofpeoplcthathave
recently shot something on video
thatneedslobcedited,"commented
Snyder.

Snyder himself did video pro~
ductions in high school,including a
version of Dalton Trumbo’s
“JohnnyGetYourGun."l—leadded
that he plans to work jointly with
SGA so that other campus organi-
zations which have special activi-
ties that they want to have taped, or
that want to make documentaries,
will have the assistance and re-
sources available to do so. Snyder
explained that such student docu-
mentaries could be shown before
the weekend movies playing in

Cray's T odious
Midnight Stroll

By Jennifer Matte:

”Coffee for my breakfasi/Shol
of whiskey on Lhe side/It's a dark
anddrearymoming/Withtheclouds
covering up thc sky."

The opening sulnzn of the first
song on Robert Cray’s latest re
lease Midnight Stroll establishes
the blues tone of the entire album.
Blues music comes from a shared
cultural experienccol‘ hardship and
pain. Its rustic forms cvolvctl
gradually from the plantations,
tarpits and sweltcring heatof slave
labor in the American South.

Robert Cmy works from within
this trliditiun. But with him the
music is somehow watered down.
It has a modem sheen to it. and the
pain is less visceral. His current
batch of songs, as well as those on
his first two albums, feature the
same I'lrstperson narrator over and
over again. He complains, But,
unlike with true blues music, the
listenerisnoteompelledtoidentify
with the singer. Instead, Cray‘s

work 15 emotionally draining; his
various plights begin to sound all
tilike,:tnd thclistenerisdulludrather
than enlivened

However. if the lyric sheet IS
pitched and its content purposely
ignored, the album transforms into
a finely crafted. sleek piece of
backgroundblucs music. Youcould
hear it in some l'unky elevator and
not be alarmed.

Cray’s own guitar work is ﬂuid
and controlled. It intertwines with
the backbeat to create a crisp
modernist texture. He is accompa-
nicd by the Memphis Hunts on
several tracks, with Wayne Jackson
on trumpet and Andrew Love on
tenor sax. Their added jazzy
homblast ﬂavors the colleclion and
gives it added vitality. And the
rolling, punctuating background
beat of the Midtown Memphis
Rythym Section further embel»
lishes the album.

Listen to these guys and forget
whatCray is hollering aboutalong-

side of them.
