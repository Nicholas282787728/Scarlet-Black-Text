The season began in early No-
vemberwith third»place ﬁnishes in
tournaments at Drake University
and Iowa State University. Recent
efforts have proven quite encour»
aging as the volleyballers travelled '
to toumaments in Marshalltown,
and this past weekend in Ames.
Although the results in Ames were
disappointing, the team showed
maturing skills.

After a shaky stan, the team
pulled off a 5-3 pool play record to
advance to the toumamentplayoffs
in second place. In the. semi-final
match, Grinnell broke out swiftly
with a 1510 Victory over Fort
Dodge. Unfortunately, the scrappy
Ford Dodge players managed to
come back, winning the match 2-1
over Grinnell.

Despite the defeat, the Grinnell
team saw outstanding play from
veterans I ason Gunnink and Bruce
N issen, among others. In addition,
help came from newcomers Dan
Brozoski, Matt Dabney, and Scott
Troxel.

While the volleyball club has
toumaments slated for almost ev-
ery weekend until mid-April, the
focus seems to be on a March 9th
tournament at home. The home
tourney should unveil a refined,
full-strength club, which should be
competitive with any team in the
state.
