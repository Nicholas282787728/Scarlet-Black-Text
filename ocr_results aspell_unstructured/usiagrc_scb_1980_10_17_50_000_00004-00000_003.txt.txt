scenf of smoke
and dead flowers

I guess this must mean
that l'm a woman now

(don’t laugh)

the words l used lo Wills

no longer (it

they belong lo a younger girl
who hid her lace

and was olrald to m,

in lroni ol strangers

/ don't know mm gm
anymore

even when I try

to go back

rt doesn't work

i loughi so hard
to gel here

and sometimes i wonder
why

To Someone
Who Once Was Very Dear

An old photograph:
the christening of a ship
The frozen merriment,
The brand-new antique dress
of the woman who is some earlier, forgotten moment
released the bottle that now hangs in space,
blurred fragments that will never fall,
as they did, to the still waves below.
Though the ship may be dismantled, discarded,
0r lost at sea
in some forgotten disaster,
This‘ moment lives, the joy of this beginning,
A memory that subsequent adventures,
Exotic lands, and miles of empty water
Cannot erase:
and yet you ask
if I remember you!

~Jennifer Loehlin

The Past

Reality slowly

Becomes entangled In dreams
And left mndlng In a crowd
Of the mlndn Invention

And slowly

The question of the pest

Becomes not of what you remember,

But of what you remember that
You believe really happened.
