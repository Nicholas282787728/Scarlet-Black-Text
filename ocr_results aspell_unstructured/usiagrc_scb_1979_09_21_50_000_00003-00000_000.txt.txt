Debunking the myths

Grinnell is a campus of many organizations But few receive
the reaction to their meeting notices that the gay community
does. (The cover photo is of a sign that graced the post office
door earlier this month)

One difficulty with the gay world is that, for many straights,
it is made up only of myths and hearsay. This week, the 88:8
focuses on Grinnell‘s gay community Senior contributor John
Mandel spent three weeks meeting with campus gays—finding
out what Grinnell 15 like for gay students ;

Mandel’ 5 three articles consider gay stereotypes, the Grinnell
gay community, and gays in the world outside of Grinnell. Still,
the light that the articles shed on gay life is small—but hopeful-
ly they will debunk some of the myths surrounding gaysl
