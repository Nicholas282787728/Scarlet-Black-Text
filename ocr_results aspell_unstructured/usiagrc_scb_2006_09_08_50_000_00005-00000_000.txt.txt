9:11 a.m.1 get out of bed, smoke a cigarette
and puton my green dress and red cowboy
boots. Today is going to be a good day.

10 a in Milton consumes my every thought
for 110 minutes

12:45 p.m. Po'stcoionial Lit class. Talking

about the Tempest makes me thirsty. Wish V

I had some‘water.

cigarettes left. This is a problem. Solution:
go back home to re—stocle

2:50 pm. IVplay a rewgames ofTetris, and

achieve my highest score ever: 72,186 at
level 10, (Take that, David Barnett!) Good
‘ show.

3:25 pm. Dinner at home. Relatively un-
satisfying, but that’s the price I pay for haVr
ing no desire to cook at this point.

6:46 pm. I bond with my housemates over
numerous episodes ofArrerm/Devuelapmmz.

9:10 p.m. Mac and I decide to actually get
some work done tonight, and so we go to
Bob’s, secure a booth, and get some stuff
done.

11:00 pm. Backin myrooiri,1delsatcsle'ep-
ing, and decide instead to watch a movie.

11:25 p.m. My Nn'glybnr 771mm is my favor-
ito movie orall time. Seriously, so good.
I watch most of it over a grilled cheese
sandwich until I just about fall asleep in my
c sir.

Sri Lanka, cont. from p. 1
friends of the students are concerned for their safety.

“It is nerverr' ting to think that someone I know is so
far away and in . place that seems to be full oftenslon,"snid
Maggie Porthoff’OS, a friend ofNeubcrt.

Despite her rear-s,

Potthoffsaid, “I feel .
conﬁdent as I could in
Chris. He will do his
best to keep himself
safe.”

The LTTE de-
manded an indepen-
dent state in northeast
Sri Lanks in 1983,
Ever since rhen,a civil war has raged between the Sri Lankr
an government and the LTTE. Although the LTTE and the
Sn Lankan military reached a ceasefire with the help of the
UN in 2002, this agreement failed to stop the violence.

Sporadic assassinations of political ﬁgures, explosion of
bombs in the capital, Colombo and the abduction and kill-
ing of civilians and humanitarian workers are resurging us
the ﬁghting intensiﬁed again in August.

Neither Neubert nor Siegel expressed worry about any
impact ofthe conﬂict
on their lives. "For
the most part, it does
not appear to overtly
affect the daily lives
of most Sri Lankr
ans," Ncubert wrote
“I can tell you that
in my host family it
is generally seen as a
— ﬁght among extremist
groups on both sides, with the majority of the Sri Lankan
people being caught in the middle.”

Siegel believes that they're not in much danger. “The
few assassinations we have heard or have been highly tar-
geted and thus the population at large is not at great risk,"
she wrote in an email to the SEER. She added that she knew
about the conﬂict before alriving in Sri Lanka and doesn’t
plan to let it interfere with her studies.

“I am more concerned about the wild dogs on my way to
school,” she wrote.

”ll l5 nerve-rarkmg to think that
someone l knowis so far away
and in a plate Inalseems m be
full aflensian.”
