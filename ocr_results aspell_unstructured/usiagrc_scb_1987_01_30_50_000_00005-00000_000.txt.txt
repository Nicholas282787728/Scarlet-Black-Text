Japanese food may be different, as is
that country's general outlook on life, but
underneath, the Japanese aren‘t really all
that different from Americans. They
laugh, cry and despair, sometimes over
firstdate jitters, as my own experience
will show. What first date would be com-
plete without them? Believe me, first date
jitters are no laughing matter, especially
when there's a language barrier, to boot.
While on a swim team skiing trip, Kozo
' “(007200) attracted me with his smile and
laugh. We talked about old Japanese TV
shows, horoscopes. American music, my
lousy Japanese teachers and his lousy
English teachers. We exchanged telephone
numbers and set up a date for December

Ups, Downs of Tokyo Dating .

(or how to stomach park rides)

25.
We decided to spend a day at an amuse-

. ment park, then dine and disco-dance. As I

approached the flower shop in the local
train station, our designated meeting
place, I ran through the entire gamut of
first date symtoms: butterflies in my
stomach, a dry mouth, difficulty thinking
m in both English and Japanese.

K020 didn‘t pull off the first 20 mintues of
chitchat any better than I did; we were
both nervous and we both knew it. As we
relaxed, we got into the spirit of the
amusement park.

The park, located in the middle of Tokyo,
isn't the big, sprawling type Americans
are used to. It was rather small, and the
rides its size They all just went around

and around.

Then, disaster struck.

Being the kind of person who gets car»
sick, I became rather ill. K020 worried
because l turned a pale shade of green and
remained that way. I worried because I
was sure he'd despise me forever. How fun
can it be to drag around someone who is
constitutionallly unfit to play on a
backyard swing set?

Despite my weak stomach, we still talk
ed about anything and everything. Kozo
had the foresight to bring along a
Japanese-English dictionary, which we
referred to more than I’d like to admit

After leaving the amusement park, we
wandered around'a bit before going to dine

New Grmnell from page 4

The one change which disappointed
ALL, some painfully so, was the disap-
pearance of the Pub. Though primarily a
constructional change, many feel that an
entire social face has been destroyed. Said
Haber, “It’s too bad about the Pub. It was
a definitely student place; the presence of
the administration was nun-existent. It
was a good place to relax.” ,

Aside from the apparent loss of the Pub,
it is difficult to see whether or not Grinnell
students themselves have Changed.
Several students admitted to having
"moved on personally," and say they are
therefore not finding campus life as m-
teresting and varied as before. Foster
commented. "Grinnell still provides ‘spice
to life,v but after spending Halloween in
Georgetown w|th 30.000 inebriated costum-
ed Creatures and other ‘things,’ I don‘t
think I‘ll comment on campus parties.”

Senior Jeffrey Dodd noted the seam]
changes: “The Grinnell Experience has
definitely changed. For better or for
worse. only time will tell. I think that each
Grinnellian must create his Own day ex
perience. especially now that the social
scene has changed. The Pub night was one
of the best I’ve ever seen.”

Ricks added another dimension to the
idea of the Grinnell Experience: “It’s the
people and my friends, and they're still
here, and I'm glad to see them. But I think
that the Grinnell Experience doesn‘t
necessarily exclude being away, My
semester abroad was interesting and
fulfilling, and I now bring a bitoScotland
back here to share.”

While some students may claim that the
nature of the student body has changed,
Foster commented that “there exists a
conservative trend. but I think the dif-
ference between seniors and freshmen is
not as great as some people suggest. In the
next few years, the College will be able to
select more of the kinds of students they
would like to have. The result may mean a
different kind of student body than we see
now, but certain basic criteria will not
disappear: emphasis on academics.
honesty in work and play, and develop
ment of self-reliance in an isolated small
town...”
