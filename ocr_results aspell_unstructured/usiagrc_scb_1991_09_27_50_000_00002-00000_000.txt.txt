City parking ordinance considered

Policy could ban night parking on campus streets

By Kim EckaIt

.—___———
The Grinnell City Council will
faceaproposedordinancenextmonth
which would limit parking on East
Street Park Street and 10th Avenue.
If passed, alternate parking will be
established during the day, but all
parking will be prohibited between
the hours of 1 am and 5 am.
According to City Manager Ted
Clausen, the proposed parking re»
striations are designed to improve
safety andcongestion on these streets,
as well as to facilitate snow removal.
Although this proposal would af»
feet many college students and other
city residents along these streets, the
college chooses to remain neutral on
what is considered a city matter. “The
collegedoesn'thaveaposition.These
are city streets," said Waldo Walker,
vice-president for college services.
”The college doesn’t want a conﬂict:
for us to take afonnal position would

be the wrong thing to do."

Jim Work, director of special ser
vices and summer activities, added
that the proposal originated with the
city. “The city does not always con-
sult the college on ordinances," he
said. "This is a city matter."

However, Clausen said that tdeas
for the proposal were brought before
the City Council two years ago by
Dan Tindall, who was then the direcr
tor of the physical plant, “I was given
the impression, at the ume, that the
college had established moreparking
spaces to alleviate the congestion on
the streets," Clausen said. He exv
plained that when thueconcems were
discussed two years ago. the city
implemented no parking zones on
l0th Avenue, near the PEC. “This
was a way to control some of the
trafﬁc and help solveapotential safety
hazard up there,“ he said.

Tindall confirmed that he asked
for limited parking on 10th Avenue

TheBt-itish debaters were selected
in a national competition to represent
their country in the 1991 Great Brit-
ain Debate Tour of the United States.

The tour will take the British de—
baters to campuses all over the U.S.
The Grinnell appearance is unique in
that it is one of the few events on the
tour featuring Oxford Union-style
debate.

According to Richard Bright, di—
rector of forensics activities at Grim
nell. the Oxford Union-style of de-
bate allows for free-flowing, often
humorous speeches from the debat-
ers, as well as audience participation
through questions and occasional
boisterous interruptions from the
ﬂoor.

In an Oxford Union»style debate,
the audience determines the outcome
by voting on the resolution at the
debate's conclusion by exiting through
the “ayes" or “noes” door.

 

to lessen the chance of an accident
involving small children using the
PEG and tennis courts. “Inever asked
for limitations on parking for East or
Park streets," said Tindall.

Clausen said that the re-paving of
several city streets last summer rer
opened discussion of street safety and
congestion.

SGA President Matt Stippich ber
lteves theproposalwillnotsolvecon-
gestion.“This willnotsolvetheprob-
lem ofcrowdod streets. It will simply
displace the cars to the side streets—
Broad and Elm," he said.

Work, however, maintained that
the college has enough parking slots
for the number of student cars regisr
tered. "The location of the spots may
notbe convenient, but they do exist,"
he Said.

Clausen suggested that the pro-
posal maynotsucceed.“lthinkthere‘s
some tendency at this point that it
may not be passed,” he said. The
proposed ordinance will be up for a
vote at the City Council meeting Oce
tober 7.

Investigations into dorm ﬁre continue

By Daniel Bliss

The two students whose Cleve-
land Hall room was gutted by ﬁre last
week have expressed happiness at the
support given by other students, but
some reservations about the perfor
mance of the administration in hart—
dling the ﬁre. Meanwhile, the fire
alarm system continues to be investi-
gatedby the Ofﬁce ofStudent Affairs
as uncertainty reigns over its effec-
tiveness.

Juniors Meg Young and Chhaya
Bhanti, the students who occupied
the Cleveland second room, com-
mendedtheassistztnceofferedbyother
students and by SGA. ”They‘rebeing

cially to help her and her roommate,

said we could take loans." She added
that the college has been very helpful
in other respects, saying that “I feel
better about the way Student Affairs
is handling things.” Bhartti, an inter-
national student, was not covered by
insurance for her personal belong-
ings.

SGA Vice President Minnie
Alexander, whois handling a fund set
up Tuesday to pay for the students,
said she “would definitely like to see
the college help the students out.”
She asked people giving money to
forward their donations to SGA in
envelopes marked “Fire Fund."

Dean of Student Affairs Tom
Crady said that the students were wel-
come to borrow money from the col-
lege for theiremergency needs. How-
ever, he added that “the college will
not do any grants."

Some expressed anger at the
administration’s handling ofthe situ-
ation. Said Andy Shechy: “‘She was
atfault.’ That'slheway they view it."
He also called for money to be raised
to help the students through their or-
deal. “I don't see thatas being unrea-
sonable for any students. If the ad
ministration doesn’t do it, then we‘ll
do it,” he said.

Cleveland residents have called

for improvements to the fire alarm
system to make it beth more audible
and more sensitive to smoke. The fire
is believed to havebumedundetected
for uptoa half an hourbefore the ﬁrst
call to the fire department was made
by Sue Barnes, a secretary in the
admissions office whose desk faces
theClevelandloggia.HoweverBuildr
ings and Grounds worker Darrell
Keenan, who rushed to the scene of
the fire after thealatrn wasraised,has
stated that the dorm fire alarm system
was running when hean-ivedand that
many smoke detectors on Cleveland
second were also on.

Dean Crady stated that possible
problems with the ﬁre alarm system,
including “premature shut-down”,
were still being investigated. Mean-
while, Georgc Howe of the Iowa Fire
Marshal‘s office has confirmed that
the fire was caused by candles.

The two students have no final
word on when they are tnoving back
into their room. However, the Office
of Student Affairs has found temper
rary accomodation for both elsewhere
in Cleveland Hall. The need for
rewiring and new dry-walling as well
as rcplaccmentofall fittingshas com-
plicated the renovation of the darn
aged room.
