 

Schlock rears its ugly head this weekend

by Nancy Carpenter

Did you ever see a movie that
was so bad, it was good? Did you
ever see eight of them in a row?

The Friday night Schlock Film
Festival offers the treat of a
lifetime, eight films you've always
heard about but were afraid to see.
Throughout the evening and Into
the night, ARH will play host to
everything from blood-sucking
monsters to Dick 'I‘racy's G-Men to
walking corpses to leather-clad
sexpots astride motorcycles:

To helpeasethe pain during the7
schlock-Illled liours, vendors will
be on hand with popcorn and soft ,
drinks. , ,

Here are the films in the order i
that they're being shown:

Horror 0! Party Beach—One of
the "teen monster” variety.
Atomic waste decays at the bottom
of the ocean until it is somehow
transformed into blood-sucking
grotesques who rise from the
depths to do in the unwary
celebranw on the beach. The most
memorable scene involves a mass
feast on a group of girls tat a
slumber party where the girls
think it's their boyfriends outside.

Secret Squirrel—In this trio of

and foreign agents in potted plants
and other improbable places.

Lewis plays‘an “extra-terrestrial"
named Kreton who falls in love
with an earth girl Only for hard
core Lewis fans (if there is such a
thing).

Who's On First—What? N0,
what's on second. The famous
Abbott and Costello routine.

Night or the Living Dead—How
much can you cram into ninety
minutes of film? This cult favorite
is possibly the greatest lowcbudget
film of all time, shot for peanuts
from a superb script filled with
riotous action and featuring a cast
of “friends of the director," who all
turn in great performances. The
living dead arise from their graves
to feed on human ﬂesh and
generally create a nuisance.

The Mini-Skirt Mob—I won’t
equivocate; this looks to be the
worst film ever made. According
to the snazzy press release, “It’s
the hard-hitting story of a wild
bunch of female animals and the

havoc they create!" The “female
animals" wear honestctOvGod gO‘

In regard to the whole selection
process, Robinson felt that because
many seniors did not vote, a
representative opinion was not
obtained. “Part of the problem,”
she continued, “is that the choices
also reply late and don’t leave (us)
much time." Finally, she
recommended that “the com»
mittee send out requests for
nominations earlier.”

The Battle Of Chile ( r and
II) is not only the best film about
Allende and the coup dated but
also is one of the best documen»
taries ever made,

The viewer is thrust into die

becomes a witness to historycin—

to put us everywhere at once.

From the horrifying sequence in
which the camermah records his
own shooting death, to the
devastating aerial, bombardment
oi the presidential palace, to the
mass political rallies on the
streets, The Battle Of Chile creates
characters of a force not usually
found in this type of film.

Director Patricio Guzman made
the film over a threecyear period.
smuggling it out of Chile to Cuba
bit by bit. Two members of the
production crew disappeared
during the coup, kidnapped by
DINA, the Chilean secret police.
and the director was repeatedly
arrested and harrassed.

The Battle Of Chie was 31}
plauded as “a landmark in the epic
historical tradition,” a film that
heartbreakihgly and soberingly
portrays a people on the brink of
civil war. For Americans, the film
holds special importance, In ex-
posmg the covert actlvmes oi‘ the
CIA in Chile, the movie illustrates
hoW our government played a
major role in the overthrow of
a constitutional government.

This week's film noir selection is
The Locket, directed by John
Brahms and starring Laraine Day.
The story, Similiar in style to The
Unsuspectcd. involves the hidden,
dangerous nature of a woman who
drives her fiance to madness and
uses men like Kleenex. Day plays a
beautitul kleptomaniac devoid of
morals. It has been suggested that
“she performs as if she were
secretly wearing no underwear to a
ladies’ luncheon." Whatever that
means.

To Kill A Mockingbird is the
choice of the history department.
This adaptation of Harper Lee’s
Pulitzer prizerwinning novel won
an Academy Award ror Gregory
