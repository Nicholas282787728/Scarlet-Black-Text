Iowa Caucus
not a Circus

by Paula Briggs

The tirst presidential caucus in
the nation will begin on February a
at 7 PM. in each oi the tour
precincts around the state oi lowa.
The eyes oi the nation are wat-
ching. but what are they watching?
The lowa Democratic caucus pres
cedure has been compared to a
three-ring circus. Perhaps an ex-

. planalion will keep you irom thinka

ing everyone is just clowning
around.

Precinct lines are drawn by
neighborhoods and population in
urban areas and by township lines
in rural areas. Each recincl's
number or delegates is etermined
by the population count in that
precmct. Some rural areas,
receive only one
delegate. in such cases people
gather at a neighbor's home and
elect the delegate by popular vote.
in urban areas. a precinct may
have up to 40 delegates. Delegates
may go to the county convention
representing a candidate or go as
uncommitted. Anyone who is will-
ing to make the commitment to at-
tend the county convention may be
a delegate.

The first Order of business at the
caucus is to elect a permanent
chair for the evening. This is usual~
ly the temporary chair who was
asked to do precaucus organizing
by the party, Once a permanent
chair has been established, resolu»
lions may come before the
meeting. If a resolution passes, it
will be taken to the county conven-
tion and eventually to the national
convention where the Democratic
party has the opportunity to adopt
it as platform. At or near 7:30
PM, resolution discussion closes
or is postponed until atter voting.

There is no secret ballot. lnv
stead. the chair designates a dil-
ferent area oi the room as the
gathering spot tor a candidate’s

supporters. Once everyone is
divided. a head count is made Do '
see which candidates have Viable
groups. a viable group being 15
percent oi the caucus attenders. if
a candidate does not have a viable
group, those voters must do one‘ol'
two things. Each person may
decide individually to support their
second-choice candidate. or the
group may Join with another non-
viable group to become viable and
reach a compromise about the
delegates. 0i course, during this
time each group is trying to in-
crease its numbers in order to
receive more delegates or become
viable. The process is not very
straightiorward; however, it is
very democratic.

in Grinnell township there are
live precincts. Grant precinct is all
the area outside the city limits but
inside the original township. The
north-south line which divides the
city's precincts begins at the north
end ol Broad Street. It continues
south until 6th and goes one block
east on 6th to Park. The line heads
south on Park to 4th where it goes
back west to Bread and continues
south [or one block, at which point
it goes through the alley and the
parking lot oi the Maytlower Home
to Park Street. This is so that the
Mayflower residents are all in the
same precinct. At the intersections
of lst and Park the line once again
goes west on lst to Broad, where it
continues scum to Garfield. At
Garfield. the line goes east to the
railroad tracks and continues
south out oi town on the tracks, The
east—west line is right down the
middle of 6th, going east to west,
until Spencer Street. At Spencer
the line goes north two blocks to 8th
and turns west until it meets the
northssouth line at Broad. It then
