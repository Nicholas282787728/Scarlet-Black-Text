Au Fait

by Sarah Asweli
Arts Editor»

Anyone who claims that nothing exciting ever
happens in Iowa obviously wasn't at AJ's
Steakhouse last month, where Denny McNurlen,
54, ate 150 ounces (over 9 pounds) of steak in
about four and a half hours. This volume or meat
was just 50 ounces shy of the world record.

"When I saw [the steak] I thought i could ride
it before I could eat it." McNurlen stated during
the interview. "1 wish I had brought my boots
and spurs." And this wasn’t much of an
exaggeration. The ZOE-ounce steak was 10 inches
wide, 20 inches long, and tour inches thick. It
was well done on the outer edges and medium
rare near the middle. "it helps to eat good food
when you do something stupid like that, “
McNurlen reflected.

McNurlen, who weighs in at 255 pound and is
5'9", started eating a little atter ﬁve in the
evening, and ﬁnished 11; ounces in the ﬁrst
hour. This was part of his strategy: to eat as fast
as he could so that his brain would not realize
that his stomach was full until later. "Something
like this you don’t sit down and enjoy," he said.

Over the next three hours, McNurlen ate about
another 1.0 ounces, in-between long penods or
digestive rest. Arterrour hours, he put his tork in
it. ”I felt full," McNurlen said, looking back.

It should be mentioned that McNurlen was also
working with a handicap a he had had two oral
surgeries within the prior two weeks that
removed vital steakcgrirldirlg teeth trom his
bottom row. thewing was ditﬁcult.

when asked if he thought anyone could have
ﬁnished that worldcrecord steak, McNurlen stated
"I dan’t know it I want to run into the man who
could have eaten the whole thing."

McNurlen ate the steak at the request of AJ’s
Steakhouse restaurant owners. They had seen
the man eat the ”Big 80” (an 80-ourice steak) in
33-minutes earlier that year. They then watched
as Mcliurlen ﬁnished the meal with a salad and
some garlic bread. When they were planning
their one-year anniversary, they gave McNurlen a
call. McNurlen's motives behind undertaking this
endeavor were very simple. “I wanted to help
out AJ’S and i wanted people to have a good
time," he said. ” I had never thought about
publicity."

Overall, McNurlen was happy with the results of
his try, The story of his attempt has appeared in
newspapers throughout the countiy and even in
England. He has also done multiple radio
interviews. "Most people probably think i'm a
few bricks short of a load [of bricks]," he said.
He did not regret not ﬁnishing the steak. "1 put
a dentin that monster." he concluded. "I did the
best job I could."

So it the Harris movie is bad, or if the Quad
menu looks less—thancsatisfyirig, or it you arejust
sick and tired or being vegan, consider trying to
break the steak-eating world record. 0r peer
pressure a friend into trying it.

Other things that weigh 9 pounds and 6 ounces:
-- an entire thanksgiving turkey

,, two stray kitty—cats

- 1/13 of a veal calt

-- a large newborn baby

Otherflwd world records to break:

-- a 32.3 hour aftercdinner speech

.. eating 113 kernels of sweet corn with a
cocktail stick in three minutes
