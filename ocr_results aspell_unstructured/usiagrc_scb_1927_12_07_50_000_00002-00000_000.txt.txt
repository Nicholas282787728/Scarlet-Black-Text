IF NOT A JOKEReTlI/iNKSl

What's the joker in the deck? Every one will be de»
lighted to have two extra days vacation. but What‘s the
joker in the deck? Where are those two days to be made
up? \Vill they be taken away lrom Spring vacation or
will they be added on to the next semester in June? It
Is obvious that they cannot affect Thanksgiving in any
Way now. It is strange the Way this agitation for longer
Christmas vacations starts up as soon as Thanksgiving is
over.

Suppose that we did not get them: Would it make any
viml oiliercnce in our lives? Grinnell is very generous
in giving vocations, We begin late in autumn; we close
surly in the summer. Many schools do not have Thanks-
giving. This year we will have ten Whole days at spring.
Far those who live two or three days journey ll'orn Grin~
neli, there was a special providence last year which might
function equally as well this year,—a providence which
permits those penple to leave Grinncll earlier or return
later without disastrous consequences,

Some one once said that, alter being eager to enter
college, actually paying tor the privilege, we seem o ‘

N0.

lnconslstent in our snmlar eagerness to gel. away. At)-
parently we are paying for a name Duly. Or for a. degree.
Perhaps we are excessively eager to Show off. to be liv-
ing advertisements or our school. There's time enough
lol- that.

If the student had a little more responsibility—the
inevitable cry for responsibilityl—he would not feel so
eager to leave. There are too many who come to college
[or the honor of the degree or because the family insist
or because they have no objective and cannot be cum-
plstcly Idle. because we are as sheep who are told to
go or to come. because we are conﬁned by the fences or
rules. we cannot appreciate education. He who paints Zl
picture is far more appreciative than he who has a pier
lure painted for himself.

But that is all by the way. What We would like to
knowiis there a joker in the deck?

SENIOR CUTS.

Gl'innell has the reputation of being a pioneer School:
it would not seem inconsistent then to pioneer in the
matter of cutting, By the time it student has atmined the
dignity of the senior Class, he should have responsibility
enough to attend classes of his own accord. and suroly
fudgment enough to know when he wants to cut. Cutting
is not. a vice; it has no moral significance. At least. if
cuts were eliminated. the instructor might be sure that
his class was attending because it wanted to, cut because
another cut would mean the loss 01' an hour’s credit.

\Vlly should the senior class benefit alone? Perhaps
the freshmen are not to be trusted; certainly the Sunbu-
mol‘s are not. But the juniors are generally level-headed
people. If the responsibility of attending the class were
put on the student and not on the registrar, the Student
would learn to react favorably. He would discover that
the class period was indispensable to his work, that withe
out it he might easily be lost in a maze or unorganizauon
and personal prejudices,

And there are some classes which can be cutr If the
students did nut come to class. the instructor might be
Sure that he was failing in his Work, that he himself was
‘zlt least partly responsible [or the student's lack of inter—
est. Or perhaps the wrong people had entered the class.
people who had no interest in the subjettt. Gradually the
uninterested, the lazy. the incapable would be weeded out
until something approximating the ideal class should exe
ist. Ultimately the whole college from the merest under—
graduate on up wunlrl be affected until only those wlling
to work and really concerned with obtaining an education
should remain. it might even ailect the rsculty so that
those either unfit lcr teaching or incompetent in one way
or another would have to change or leave. Not inferring
that Grinnell has any such. but someday she might have.
Just as some people are not born' to be students, others
were never made for teachers.

If this matter all senior cuts is worth consideration, is
there any reason Why it should not go into effect at ones
There is a full semester left in the year; one semester's
trial might indicate whether it would be feasible as a
permanent thing. If the seniors Were to give up some
other privilege in exchange for this. it would not be hard
to persuade them to relinquish their rights to the front
rows 'n chaps G A
