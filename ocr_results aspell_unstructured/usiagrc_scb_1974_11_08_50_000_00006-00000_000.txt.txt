Reduction oi these pressures

A tenahle goal is acceptance and

Erwin Cnllham labels the next
two years "among the most
critical furmankind.” a ieel rig he
made clear in his south iungc
lecture “The Future til the
American Presidency and the Two-
Party System” Monday, Nov. 4.

Canhzlm felt that the trio of
Gerald Ford rests on the
President's ability to reconstruct
the posteWatergate government
with the best talent availatllr He
added that a strong cabinet was
essential [or this reconstruction

Despite Nixon's abuse of power
While in ofﬁce. Caitham cm-
phasized the need (or a powerful
presidency to lead the nation out of
the pressing national prohlenis oi
inilation, energy shortages,
warfare, and national defense. He
warned that Congressional
leadership must not consistently
override executive power and
thereby abuse its own powers in
the process

Nationaniu'ties

0n the issue oi national parties in
the iuture, Canham expressed his
view that the u.s. “really doesn’t
have parties, but rather
coalitions. Republicans and
Democrats are iading away as
strong partisan titles into more
generalized categories oi cone
servatives and liberals,

For this reason, Canham feels
that even it “vetorpi‘oof” Congress
will not be able to dominate
national policies since Party
discipline has become so hard to
maintain.

His most surprising prediction
was the possibility of a coalition
between Ronald Reagan and
George Wallace during the next
two years to garner support of the
discontcdnted |‘lgI’|l~\Ving
Republicans and Dcmocrilts. lie
also predicted that. such an alliance
would be run on a very pat ‘ltic
campaign. platform,

Rocketeller

Canham also touched on topics
outside ot the presidency and two.
party system. He viewed Nelson
Rockeriellar's nomination for
VicerPrcsidenlas “disturbing" in
light at his heavy campaign
spending and his wealth in general
He said that the prevalent attitude
in Congress is now on “getting it
over with” rather than dragging
out the lengthy investigations on
another candidate,
