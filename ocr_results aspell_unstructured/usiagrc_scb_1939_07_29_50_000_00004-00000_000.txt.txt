JOHN S. NOLLEN

TO THE CLASS OF 1943.

Tcmpits ftLgit—cvcn a century is brief, in
the perspective of history, and geologlsts
talk glibly in millions of years. Shortly
after your graduation, the college will cele—
brate its Centennial At the‘ recent com-
mencement there were three representatives
of tlle sixtyeyear class, and a junior waiting
on them remarked: “When l return for my
Si tie’th, it will be the year 2000!”

But all this has ollly academic interest
for you, What you are thinking about just
now is the year 1939-40, which will always
remain one of the significant epochs ill your
career. As the poet puts it, you are stand—
ing (1 hope with eager rather than ”reluce
tant” feet) ”where the brook and river
meet." You are passing from adolescence
to maturity, l‘rom tutelage to self—deter-
mination, moving otlt toward wider oppor-
tunity and larger responsibility We, who
have long since come that way, stand here
to welcome you and to congratulate you—
but not to envy. However happy you may be
in college (and we wish you every happr
ness), you will find, if you do your part in
our common enterprise, that there is vastly
greater happiness awaiting you ill later
years, There is simply no end to the edu—
cational process in which you have made a
beginning unless you allow yourself to die
at the top and to stop growing in knowledge
and wisdomias some college graduates une
fortunately dot

College will do its best service for you

if it awakens your interest and strengthens
your courage and raises your aspirations to
a higher level. And you can best serve the
college, as well as yourself and your gene»
ration, if you take advantage of every
stimulus to growth and appreciation. Life
at Grinnell is full of such opportunities
Seize them and use them daily if you really
want an education and a chance to apply it
successfully and serviceably. We are ill this
job together for a great purpose. Let’s
go!
(Signed)
John S. Nollen, President
Grinnell College

THE MOST FOR THE MONEY

Since the hot summer is not the time for
action but rather for cool drinks, a chair,
and some, but not too much thought, we
have beell mulling over olne ideas we
should like to have cla ied during the
college year but which were lost in the jam.

In the peace and quiet that' have des—
cended upon us we have especially thought
of all the talk that was poured out upon
our heads, how much there was of it, and
how much of it was probably lost ill the
pressure of the school year. For instance,
think of the lectures in the college lecture
course. Of course, it is true that many of
us can not think much of them for we did
not hear them. In spite of the fact that we
pay hundreds of dollars out of our semester-
fee fund to secure outside speakers, about
half of the student body ignore them,

Also, as we recall recent figures who
have appeared in Grinnell, Frank Lloyd
Wright, Will Durant, Emil Ludwig, and
others, all of national and even international
l'dmeiall of whom as it happens, we went
to heargwe wonder if they really did say
very much. At least we can not for the
life of us, lecall anything they said. Can it
be thutiwith the possible exception of
Durantithey really did not have much to
say, that they are men who have become
famous by doing things and not by talking
about them? Just because a man is a great
artist, scientist, or explorer is no sign that
he is a good speaker. Tlle probabil ies, ill
fact, are all in favor of his not being one

Why not change our advice to the lec-
ture committee, ask them to try to secure
not so much “famous doers" as good speak—
crs‘! How many of us would turn out to
hear them?

Why not ask the committee to secure
lecturers who will not be just exploiting a
famous name, and us, but one who will tell
us something worth listening to, something
to think about when the dog-days come in
the summein

Perhaps the easiest way to waste fam- years
is to go to college.

Yes, we'll admit that this statement
comes uncomfortably close to heresy; but

—By w.c.H ——

Accor mg to the reports trlclie
ling in from the llatlon‘s capitol,
Indiana’s whitebaired boy, Paul
Vorics MchlLt, is getting up log
ularly for breakfast thcsc days.

It seems that the newly-up-
pcinted head 01 the Federal Sc-
euritics agencies is assiduous-
1y taking his toast and mliee
with the more prominent of the
Washington correspondents, one
by one, as a. part or his good-
will campaign loukillg‘ tor-word
to 19-h). For now, after loud-
illg tho pr .c post of Security
Administrator with all its free
publicity, tlle hmnlsmnc Hoos-
ier is more eager than ever to
tune up where Franklin D.
leaves otr. Alltl no wouldn‘t be
surprised it he did it.

For here is a gentleman who is
going to be hard to heat in any
man's conntly. Goodrlooking, dye
namic, comparatively young, and
wlth a record as a capable arr
nnnlstrator and a shrewd politi-
cian, this tow-headed ex—law
teacher has always beeu known
to get what he wants, After col-
lcctillg memberships in nearly a
dozen fraternities, including l=hi
Bcts Kappa and Sigma Delta Chi,
(luring his college car-oer, he grad-
uatcd from Harvard in 1916 with
an LLB. in his Jesus. Tllen, nail-
ing a berth on the faculty or the
Indiana School. or Law, Mchltt
worked up to tho (leanshlp or that
institution, a position which he
held from 1925 to 1933. Mean—
time, he became a colonel in the
United States army reserve, and,
as a darn-horse candidate, clinched
the post of national commander
of the American Leglou in 1928.

With that on the books, he
wrigglod into the governor's
sent of ludinnn, ‘gnining a rep-
utnlion us up econnlllioulmlmill-
istrntor and the nickname,
”Hoosier Hitler,” the bitter as

then, it is rare that the unvarllished truth J

does not. It is possible for a young man or
woman to go to Grilnlcll or ally other school
for four years and graduate with a perfectly
good diploma, but nothing more. Why deny
it? How often we see a college graduate
evidence such colossal ignorance and absence
of even the most elementary sense of values
that he is a complete failure to himself and
a liability to society!

Yes, such a thing can happen here. It
has taken place ill every college and univer-
sity ill the country; and you will be a rare
class indeed if among you there are not a
few failures and a few bluffers who, not
satisfied with ruining their own opportun-
ities, seek to draw their companions into
their orbit of uselessness.

Why then, you ask, go to college at all?
The answer is that college, like the world
itself, presents everyone with an opportu-
nity to advance, to improve upon himself.
No college can guarantee to turn out a
group of nlen and women each year and be
able to say that each and every one will be
an asset to society. All good colleges can,
however, say to every man and woman that
enters, “The opportunities are hereimake
the best of them with our help."

Frank Mcilale, llloNutt hit the
high seas for the job 01 ngll
comm error to (he 1-hilip-
pines, there to simmer in semi-
obscurity while his pals did the
spadevwork tor a. “MoNutt for
1940" boomi

Now, with the boom well under
way, friend Paul has hot-rootedit
back to the mamaland to live the
spotlighted life of a self—nomi-
nated condidatc for the presidene
cy. ,Alld you can bet your Sun-
day hrcechcs that Pretty-Boy Mc-
Nutt isn't going to lose any time
in going to town in his new job-
and not for the benefit of the
seculity agencies cltherl Paul v.
is in that job for what he callgct
out of it, and he hopes that that
will be the presidency.

Backed as he is by a power
in] shite machine and managed
by nil-nun )[cHale, a politician
as shrewd as they come, Mo,
Nutt will he tooting his own
horn louder than ever lrom now
on. And unless the ﬁeld changes
our money says that this seliv
seeking ludiana glamoureboy
has a better-tllﬂn—evell chance
or swinging the deal, for he
colllbines a liberal amount of
executive ability with a delinlte
dose or‘political “lunph”. Fur—
thermore, he is in the odd posi-
tion or having both Hopkins
and the Wall street boys in his
corner. cunllied up as something
of a canser drive now, ho has
only to will tllc friendship of
labor to make the picture come
plate—41nd his new job is a set-
up {or that. He’s a selﬁsh,
llandeshaking' Democrat, but he
puty nnihe the gmde on his
good looks and brains.
