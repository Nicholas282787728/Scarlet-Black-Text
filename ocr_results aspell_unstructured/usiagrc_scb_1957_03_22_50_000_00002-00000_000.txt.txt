gtudent Inquiries,
Consults Thornton

Ill its regular
Wednesday night Student
Council decided to invite
Givens L. Thornton, regis-
trar, to attend all open meet—
ing to discuss transcript fees
and i‘sllancc. Also the Council
took action on the “Guys and
Dolls" funds itnd a faculty park-
ing area ilcai' ARH was sug-
gested.

The

meeting

council prepared an inc
ritation to Thornton to appear
at. one of the council’s open
meetings in the near tuture to
tumor lnquilies and explain
many oi the tunctions of his
othce. The council took the ac»
tion upon hearing the report of
one ot its special investigators
concerning the tee tor grade
transcripts and the normal time
required tor their issuance.

The investigation and report
nrosc out or inquiries regard-
ing the st ice for each trans-
cript issued, and allegations
that delay in their prepara—
tion had seriously jeopardized
the applications oi some sen-
iors to graduate schools.

The report stated that the st
‘fcc is a national minimum and
that the Registrar's office has
such a diversity et duties that
transcripts are oitcn necessarily
delayed.

The council wound up ear-
lier business by authorizing
immediate transfer of $200 to
the Opera \Vm‘kshop fund for
the future productiun of “Guys
lllld Dolls", thus fulfilling its
responsibility in the matter.

Upon this transfer, the coun-
cil treasury was lett with $554.65.
a sum less than it agreed to re-
serve for KGRW operation when
it cut the station’s appropriation
earlier, pending investigation.
The council has yet to determine
how 'ts responsibility in this
area will be carried out.

In other action, a resolution
was passed requesting that a We
serve parking area be establish-
ed on Eighth st. near A-Ri-i for
faculty autos, and that all sen-
loi possessing cars he asked to

c during class time with due
ect [or faculty- parking at
the same hours.

In regard to the proposed
new ilhrary huilding, Alan
Jones (history), so tncuity
adviser. suggested that any
student opinion on the nature
or the building he brought to
him.

Bob Mchmsey, president, se-
lected Tom Skornia to replace
tNeil Horton as National Student
Association representative, ElecA
tion ot a Treasurer was post—
'poned until next week.
