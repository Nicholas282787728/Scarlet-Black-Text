Volleyball team drops four matches

BY MARCIE SCRIBNER

Following Saturdays 04 showmg in the University of
Dubuque Tournament last Sanirday, eoaeh Tom.Sonniehsen
wants to see the Pioneers get better at receiving serves and
show “a gradual increase in consistency” heading into the con
ference season.

The young Grinnell team also needs to work on communi-
cation and defensive positioning if they are to improve on a 1-7
start, according to outside hitter Jessica Hodgmen '07.

“The teams we went up against [last weekend] did things
right that we did wrong," Sonniehsen said, “In two of our
matches, passing broke down, Ifwe don’t pass well, our offense
doesn't do well."

The Pioneers were swept by Viterbo University (15~30,
15730, 16730) and the University of Chicago (24730, 24730,
25730). Grinnell bear Grand View College in the first match
(30728) but fell in the next three (1530,1730, 11730).1n the
game against University of Dubuque, the Pioneers endured a
similar fate (18730, 1440, 2440.)

The problems that arose in the tournament were partly
based on poor communication by the young team, according to
jessica Hodgmen ‘07. She said the team worked on communi-
cating and being in the correct defensive positions during the
past week of practice.

A bright spot on the team last weekend was Caroline Bailey
’10, who led the defense with 68 digs.

Bailey had been unable to serve until Saturday due to a
shoulder injury, and Sonnichsen expects to see good things in
the future with her serving. She recorded a tenn‘rhigh three
aces versus the University ofChieago on Saturday.

“It’s hard to come back and play another game after we lost
earlier in the day. This tournament was all about staying posit
tive and not giving up," Bailey said.

“I think ifwe forget about the past tournament we will do
fine in the coming tournament [at Dominican University]."

The team will be without setter Courtney Smith '09, who is
out on academic probation,when they face Dominican Uluver’
sity nnd Fontbonne University this afternoon and Benedictine
University and North Central College tomorrow in River Fort
rest, 111., at the Dominican University Tournament.

Hodgmen, an outside hitter from Evnnston, 111., will ﬁll
Smith's spot in the rotation.

"I am really hopeful for this season. We have a lot of good
and talented players, but we are young and that means we have
to learn how to play with each other," Hodgmen said.“1’in cite
cited about the chance to set this weekend."

The Pioneers will be home Monday to host William Penn
University at Darby Gym.

Other top Pioneer runners included Charlie Knuth ‘08 in 11th,
Henry Reich '09 in 20th and Sam Cnlisch ’10 22nd.

The Gtinnell alumni team finished 15 points behind the
current students with 75 points. Former All—Americans Adam

places, with Justin Riley '06 in 13th. Omondi Kasidhi '05 and
Brian Menakcr’04 rounded out the top five in 18th and 21st.

Ballcw said the men’s team has great potential. Noting that

the team last made it to Nationals in 1991,Bnllew said that the
current group of runners has a chance to seriously compete for
years to come. Young runners “are putting in the work now."
Ballew snitl.“1t's going to pay off this year and iii the future."

For Freeman, it was especially notable for the women to
beat the powerful Wartburg team. “Wattburg was ranked ninth
in the nation last week," Freeman said. “They’ve been our big
gest competition in the past, but [beating them] says that we
might be a force to be reckoned with,notjust in the conference,
but also nationally."

 

 

Women move to 3-1-1

3v NATE LINDSEY

The Grinnell college women's soccer team put on a de-
fensivc and offensive clinic for the Cornell Rams \Nednesday
afternoon (l! the Grinncll College Soccer ComplextThe Pio-
neers shut out the Rams on defense while ﬁnding the back of
the net four timcs offensively.

”We're really starting to come together as a team. It was
great to see the hall in the hack of the not. It's something
promising for the futui-e,"Moliy Kratz'OS said.

Grinnell gained the momentum iigdinst Cornell by score
ing four goals within 20 minutes, Sofia Skraba ’08, Hannah
Sayle ’08, Amelia Stoker ’09, and Becca Mackenzie '09 all
scored within the last ten minutes of the first half and the
first ten minutes of the second half.

“It was gretit to see the scoring prentl out between
four pcoplc,“coach Heather Benning id. “The more we can
get players involved in our offensive game, the harder it is for
teams to try to shut us down.”

Grinnell tallied up a total of 28 shots duiing the match.
Defensively, the Pioneeis not only recorded their fourth
shutout of the year, but also limited the Rams to just one
shot—which was not on goal—the entire game.

“We’ve only allowed two goals this year, “Banning said.
“Getting the shut out is something that's very important to
us as far as the defensive goals for the season."

Gtinnell improved their record to 3-1-1 with the win,
with their only loss coming at the hands of Concordia Col-
lege last Sunday, 2-0. The Pioneers will begin Midwest Con-
ference play Tuesday against Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.
The Pioneers will be home next Sunday when they play Be—
loit College at 11:00 am

Men get first win in rain

av DAN HARDIN

The Grinnell men‘s soccer team put up their first vice
tory of the season in Tuesday's light drizzle, defeating Core
nell College 270 behind goals from Cole Henderson ’07 and
Andrew Stephenson '10.

They went into the Cornell game at 0721 after losing to
central college and Illinois Wesleyan and playing Millikin
to a 1-1 tie. After the Millikin tie last Sunday, the Pioneers
knew they had some improvements to make in consistency.

“We’ve been putting together great patches of play, but
wcehave yet to put together a full 90 minutes," said forward
Andrew Walsh '09.

Goalkeeper Sam Lancaster’os put together a full 90 min-
utes of good play against Cornell, recording his ﬁrst shutout
of the season. A tenacious Pioneer defense did not allow the
Rams many chances. After scoring his first goal of the season
last weekend against Millikin, tall midﬁelder Alden Stine-
brickner~Kau£fman '08 might have used his head more than
his feet to keep the ball out of the Pioneer's defensive zone.

Zimbabwe native Farai Rusinga '08 was around the ball
all game in the winThe formrd, who began the season as
a midfielder, made several runs towards goal but came up
empty each time.

"We still haven‘t played our best soccer, and it is going
to be eteiting when we do," Henderson, who scored the go
ahead goal in the 39th minute against Cornell, said.

The Pioneers continue their season tomorrow in the
Buena Vista open and begin conference play at Monmouth
on Wednesday.

 

 

 

Women’s golf finishes ninth of 16 teams at Knox

BY T.J. HAWLEY

According to head coach David Arseneault, the women‘s
golfers are posting the best scores the school has seen in a hand-
ful ofyears, and they have a good chance to finish near the top
of the Midwest Conference. Marie Liska '07 believes that the
look the Pioneers got at Knox College last Saturday will help
them in the championship mect OCL 7, also hosted by Knox.

The team placed ninth out of 16 teams at Knox in its first
meet of two last weekend. Amy Livingston '09 and Haddie
Dawson '08 each shot 94 to pace the Pioneers and tie for 36th
place individually. Stephanie Goggin '10 chipped in a 97, Cait-
lin Campbell ’08 added a 101, and Marie Liska '07 ﬁnished at
108 to round out scoring.

Grinnell finished 14th out of 19 teams at Monmouth on
Sunday. Campbell led the team with a 92, followed by Goggin’s
97. Livingston shot a 103, and Liska shot a 112.

The Pioneers shot better last weekend than they did at lle

iinois College’s meet Sept. 2, but team captain Campbell sees
bettcr scores on the horizon as the team works out some kinks.

Arseneault was “pleased" with the team’s performance, and
believes that the players will lower their scores as they become
more comfortable with the greens around the conference and
work on a few areas ofrheir games.

The players need to “be a bit more aware of wheie they
want to place the ball and where they want to land it on the
green," he said

In addition to that team goal, individual golfers set their
own goals. Golfers, explained Campbell, compete mostly
against themselves, not their teammates or other teams.

For Campbell, that goal is to score lower than 90 in a con-
ference meet. Liska's goal is to have the best scoring average of
her career.

Despite the individual nature of golf, Campbell stressed the
importance of maintaining a good team dynamic

“We're pretty good at encouraging each other," Campbell
said.

Thar encouragement takes place during the week at
Grinnell Country Club, where the Pioneer golfers tee it up
for daily practice, In September and October, they travel every
weekend for meets.

The focus of practice is preparing for the upcoming meets
and evaluating the golfers, especially in preparation for the
Conference meet. Four participants for that meet have already
been decided; Livingston, Campbell, Goggin and Dowson,

Performances at the upcoming Loras College and St, Ame
brose meets will finalize a fifth player and round out the roster.

“We’ve started off better than we did last year,” Campbell
said. “Hopefully we will do well at conference this year and
more people will know that we are out there."

The Pioneers teed off in East Dubuque, Iowa, today at 10
am. to compete in the Loras College Fall Invitational.
