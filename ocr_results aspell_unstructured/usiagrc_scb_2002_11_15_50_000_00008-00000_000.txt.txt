Burling inspires unintentional poetry

What’s the deal with the computers in the library?
NOW I don’t know too much about computers, and I
admit that the reference Macs seem to be of substanr
dard size, but why can I not get webmail to ﬁt the
screen? Is there some sort of minimum size beyond
which webmail won't shrink? Sometimes decreasing the
font size works, but rarely, Every time I write emails I
either accept the fact that any words that go off the
screen may he unintelligible, orI press enter every time
I reach the end of the screen and messages and up
looking like some lame attempt at poetry or iambic
pentameter. Also, I know that they are for reference,
but everybody uses them for email. The Fact that I can’t
open word documents to print attachments is a serious
pain in the ass. I hardly think thatir word were on the
computers they/d always be used up with people stand»

Grinnell hippies out of contra!

I know I should have expected it coming to Grinnell, but
sometimes me hippies here are reallyjusttuo much. I mean
all these upperrmiddle class kids running around barefoot
with unwashed hair protesting this or that. The worst part
is they are so damned organized. They can stop any tarpon
ration in their track with mobster tactics. Students Against
Sweatshops? More like Students Against Proﬁts. And those
ones aren’t even the worst no every time we turn around
on this campus we have to hear inane chanting about old
growth wood and whining about recycling. Flankly, that
just makes me wahtto torch (he raintorest myself, and roast

sophisticated cocktails. Maybe then we could move up in

Basic skills ignored in kindergarten

Okay, I’ve got a few bones to pick this week. How
ever, random rants are not the place to complain about
problems with the educational system in this country,
or the horrors of cloning, or the Bush Administration.
Random rants are the perfect place to complain ahout
certain basic skills which seem to have bypassed the
majority of the student body, namely that of tucking in
one’s chair when one leaves it. This is a BASIC skill!
rhe kind you learn in kindergarten. We’re talking an
”okay-boysrandrgirls-now-push-in-your»chairsrand-
comerslt-pretzel-styleromthefloor-ror-story-time—ror
dayrwe’re-reading-Une Fish, Twp Fish, Red Fish, Blue
Fish-by-Dl. Seuss. Does-everyone-know-wliorDr. Seuss-
is?” kind of skill. And you know what? They all know.
And they also know how to tuck in their chairs! How
'bout ya'll do the same, and if you do, Oh the Place:
You'll Go.
