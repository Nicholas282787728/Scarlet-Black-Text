Polls Close in Irish Presidency Race

Polls closed in Ireland‘s ﬁve—candidate presidential
election Thursday. with government nominee Mary
McAleese favored to defeat her main rival. opposxtion
parliamentarian Mary Banotti.

Ofﬁcials said vote-counting would commence Friday
morning with ﬁrst results expected in the late afternoon.
Pre-election surveys suggested that McAleese. 46. a
law professor from British-ruled Northern Ireland.
would pick up crucial support as weaker candidates
were eliminated. A devout Catholic. she is regarded as
one of the brightest of her generation and is pro vice-
chancellor of Queen’s University, Belfast.

Banotti, 58. a member of the European Parliament, is
on the liberal wing of the largely conservative Rine
Gael party. the republic’s second biggest group.

Four women and a man fought ‘an often stormy cam»
paign to succeed Mary Robinson. Ireland's ﬁrst woman
head of state who resigned in Septemberjust short of
a full seven»year term to become United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights.

The three other candidates were: Rosemary “Dana
Scallon. a singer and promoter of traditional Catholic
values; Adi Roche. an antirnuclear campaigner and
charity worker; and Derek Nally, a retired policeman
who founded a group to support crime victims.

Iowa Couple Awaits Septuplets

A 29—yearrold Iowa woman pregnant with septuplets
was confined to a bed Thursday, awaiting the rare mul-
tiple birth, hospital ofﬁcials said.

The three girls and four boys expected by Bobbi and
Kenny McCaughey of nearby Carlisle. Iowa. were at
28 weeks gestation and were gaining weight, a good
sign for their chances of sruvival, those monitoring the
situation have said.

Officials could not say when the babies might be ex-
pected to be born. but said a Cesarean section would
almost certainly be performed.

No complete set of septuplets has ever sruvived, doc-
tors saidt

Hospital officials have hinted that fertility drugs were
used by the McCaugheys, who have sought some mea-
sure of privacy. The father works for a car dealership
and the couple has a 2-year-old daugher.

Multiple births have become much more comman since
the l9705. wher fertility drugs and techniques to stimu-
late ovulation came into wide use.

British Au Pair Found Guilty of Killing
Baby

British au pair Louise Woodward collapsed in tears af-
ter a Massachusetts jury on Thursday evening found
her guilty of secondrdegree murder in the February
death of nearly 9~month-old Matthew Eappan.

“I didn’t do it. ldidn't do it." the 19-year-old from the
small English village of Elton, near Chester, cried out.
“Why did they do that to me? Why did they do that?
I'm only 19,“ she sobbed as her lawyers tried to com4
fort her. She clutched her attorney's ami for support as
the nine women and three men ofthejury. looking pale
and haggard after deliberating Woodward ’s fate for
more than 26 hours over two-and-a—half days. left the
courtroom.

Her parents, Susan and Gary. looked stunned by the
verdict. Sitting behind them in the spectator rows, their
friends wept.

During the three-week murder trial. the proscutio‘n
claimed that on February 4 a frustrated and angry Wood-
ward ﬁrst violently shook the crying and colicky baby.
and then slammed his head against a hard surface. He
died ofmassive head injuries five days later at Boston's
Children's Hospital.

Medical experts challenged much of the prosecution‘s
case. testifying that the baby's injuries were likely to
have been sustained for about two weeks before the
date on which Woodward was accused of causing them.

Mystery and suspicion shroud the sudden
resignation of President Pamela Ferguson
Following Ferguson’s perfunctory vax memo
to the entire campus on Friday. October 17.
tumors have bccn spreading and neither the

Board of Trustees nor Ferguson herself
has offered an explanation.

In her surprise memo. Ferguson
thanked “the Grinnell College commur
nity for the privilege ofservltlg as presir
dent of the college."

“Griiinell College is a truly outstandr

trig institution." she said.

Ferguson was Grinnell’s
llih president and the first
woman to hold the office.
She helped to improve the
college’s physical appear-
ance by overseeing the addi»
tions to the science facilities
and the new Fine Arts Build~

 

 

 

 

ing. She led a successful $75 million capital
campaign. and since she‘s been president. the
endowment has grown from $293.7 million
to $754.6 million.

Dean Charlie Duke has been appointed
Interim President by the Board and will take
over Ferguson’s duties on January 1. 1998.

A national search for the 12th president
was begun immediately after the Board ac-
cepted Ferguson‘s resignation. With a selec»
tion committee chaired by a member of the
Board. The selection process will be similar
to the participatory model used in the 1990
Search. when Ferguson was ﬁrst hired.

“The campus community. including trust,
ees. faculty, staff and students, will be in-
volved in the search process." Duke said in
a press release.

Dean Duke has said he is willing to talk
to anyone about this. but at press time he
was unfortunately unavailable for an inter-
view. Attempts to speak to Ferguson were
refused. Her ofﬁce said only that Ferguson
has already made public in her statements to

the Grinnell community all that she has to
say,

Many students are concerned by all the
secrecy they perceive. They find it inconceiv-
able that Ferguson resigned without warning,
especially mid—semester.

“What I wonder about is why they did it
so craftily," Alegre Bussetti ‘98 said._“They
did this right before fall break. so nobody re-
ally got a chance to talk about it. It seems
suspicious. And now she‘s away for three
weeks. conveniently. It‘s just so strange.”

“I don‘t like the fact that it’s so hush hush."
continued Bussetti. “that there’s so many ru-
mors about it. ljust want to know what hap
pened because these little vax memos don’t
say much."

Another student commented. “We go to
this college. damn it. We have a right to
know." ‘ l .

Bussetti also doubts Ferguson will actui
ally return to Gtinnell next year as a tenured

The Forum The cam us
living room is a busy p ace

BY DAVl'D NATHAN
Staff Writer

Michael Simsa’s a busy man. As Fo-
rum Director. lic IS responsible one ofthe
most lively locations on campus

“We’ve been pretty active." Sims said.
“For the last couple weeks there hasn‘t
been free time in either the North or South
Lounges or even the Coffeehouse. It's
all been scheduled."

“Like everywhere. we're tight on
space, but we‘re doing well. The Forum
is ﬁrst and foremost the main community
meeting place. It is a place for students.
professors and staff to come together and
enter into a social dialogue; it's here to
he used for study purposes or tojust kick
back. Ithink itishould be busy: it‘s here
to be a union.”

The Forum. which houses a student
gallery, private kitchens and dinning
room, two lounges. a game room. slur
dent organization office space. a Coffee
house and The Grill. Grinnell's on camv

pus restaurant. is hosting the Music De
partment this fall and also lends space to
several 13ch classes and a children's lan~
guage program.

Two ﬁrst year students who wished not
to be identified found the forum a'very
eclectic place to be. Said one: “I think the
Forum is really great. in that so much is
going on there. You can always finds
quiet place to study or hang out with
people in the same building. You can also
get food there almost anytime," the stu~
dent paused and added with a grin. “ex7
cept when you really need it."

The other agreed. “It's amazing that
they've managed to get all the stuff in
there that they have. from the SGA office
to the Grill to the student organization of
rides and the art gallery and everything
else they‘ve got. They make good use of
the space they do have."

It's tricky. but Forum Director Sims
works hard to make sure the space is used
as productively its possible.

Last Saturday. as buses and airplanes were rerouted due to dangerous
weather conditions throughout the Midwest, Iowa’s skier remained
clear. Ar Grinnellians awoke Sunday morning, however, they found
the campus blanketed by snow. More than eight incher had fallen by
noon, stranding students and professors en route from vacation sites
and damaging property and trees. Due to the unreasonable warmth
of early autumn, the Inca/ﬂan: had not yet shed their leaves. The
weight of foliage and snow combined was more than many could
handle, leading to broken branches and splintered 0r fallen trees. In
several cases. as above, trees had [a be cut downfor safety reasons.

 

 

AlternatiVe Break combines service with fun

Student groups volunteer time and effort in Tennessee and North Dakota

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

Last week. while most Grinncll stu—
dents uscd break to relax. Charles
Warpehoski '01 was busy helping to re
build flood-ravaged communities in North
Dakota. Warpehoski got there though
Grinnell’s Alternative Break program.
For a week. he worked with other Grin-
nell students in Grand Forks and on the
Spirit Lake Reservation.

“There was a lot of work to do," said
Each Ly '98. who co—led the trip to North
Dakota with Rachel Taylor ’98. “They
warned us beforehand not to wear clothes
we wanted to wear when we got back.”

BcSides rebuilding basements and
cleaning yards. the North Dakota group
also volunteered their time in smaller
communities.

“I wanted to do ﬂood relicfand my co-
leader also wanted to work with minori-
ties. and we also had to find a destination
that we could get to. work at and return
home in a week." said Ly. ”North Dar
kotn worked out."

Whllc one group [Oiled up north. an
other headed south to Memphis. Tennesr
see. Melinda Jones '99, who corlcd the
trip with the hclp ofLia Cunningham '99.
icltthe trip with a worthwhile experience.

“We made very good use of our time
down there." said Jones. “We worked
with scvorzil organizations and did a lot
ofwork. but we had a lot of fun too." By
the end of the week. the Memphis group
had donated hundreds of hours to the
Ronald McDonald House. to It homework
tutoring program for homeless children.
to yard work for home bound individuV
ails, and even to parking cars for zi non.
profit fund-raiser.

“Thc group was wonderful." said

One Alternative Break group. pictured here. put together safe sex packetsfar F riends For Life.

Jones. “Everyone was very enthusiastic
and willing to work long days into the
evenings. Everyone [there] seemed re-
ally surprised that wc would drive all the
way front lawn to help them out in Memr
pliis."

Besides putting in long hours helping
others. many of tlle alternative break par-
ticipants I talked to mentioned the social
aspects of the ll‘lp, especially getting to
know students they hadn't met before,

“One of the best ways to get to know
people is to work with them on a comr
tnon missmn," said Ly. “Alternative break
provides an environment that lets students
get to know others quickly."

Matt Rhoadcs '99. a veteran alterna-
tivc breaker. ngrccd, “It’s a great oppor—
tunity to meet other students," he said. “In
fact. it’s one ofthc best aspects ofthetrip.
Students who participate end up meeting
people thcy probably wouldn't get to
know outside of the trip."

Alternative break trips tzlke place twicc
a year. ztt fall break and again at spring
break. and are run by students though
Grinnell College's Community Service
Center. or CSC. For the last ten years.
Grinnell students have traveled through-
out the Country and even into Canada to
do public servtce in cooperation with pre-
existing programs. Living quartcrs are

usually meager. but even so. students on
the North Dakota trip found themselves
put up in a resort.

“That's not how ii usually works." said
CSC coordinator Amy Ellert. with a
wink. “[The North Dakota group] got.
lucky," said Rhoades. “We usually sleep
in church basements and in the homes of
Grinnell alumns.“

Grinnell College subsidize: the many
ofthe costs cfthc trip and provides vans
and food for the groups.

Students interested in participating are
urged to get in touch with the Commur
nity Service Center. located in the base»
