Tim: Wyatt, don’t call them ﬁrsttyears. They
are lc\it:l»t)nc freshmen. They'll be leveletwo
freshmen, then lCVh‘lrllii‘CE freshmen, and ﬁe
nally seniors like us

Mike Guys, we were all ﬁrst years once But
\our booze being stolen rs not really the heart
of the issue. Self governance is about more
thnl‘ijubt patty etiquette. It's about being a te-
sportsible member ota comrnrrnity thar holds
everyone accountable for actions that affect
the whole.

Wyatt; And my responsibility is throwing
campus bikes off of loggias.

lfl don’t damage those bikes,

being dead. But since we're still inllong about
it,it must be alive And il'it was dead but taint:
[melt to lti, it must be ii zombie!

Tim: Oh my Godl

Wyatt: I'll talk to Tom Ciady Lind see ifhe‘ll
let me get a shotgun and go zombie hunting:
After all, Mike, the campus needs ptotection
hour the lirrng dead, so I’ll do in) duty lind
shutter some zombie Slullls.

can't govern themt

I should run the world} knowwhat's best for
everyone, and zombies suck.
Wyatt: I don’t know,Tim. This zombie thing
sounds kind of cool. After all, I’d get a shot
gun. Anti Selftgovernzince is starting to grow
on me it’s basically another word 'for “vigi-
lantejustice.”
Mike: Both oryou, stop itl You have abso-
lutcly no idcawhar selt— governance means ts
not about violence or oiignrchv, and its deﬁr
nitcly not about the undead It s a way ofliu
ing where everyone realizes that their actions
impact the community, notjust themselves. It
can be both positive and negative, and the drrry
lies with each person to solve problems within

the community rather than
relying on a third party tor

traps,

Tim: Listen, Mike, if there’s

one thing that history has taught us, it’s that
metal imperatives will never provide an effec-
tive incentive for action. only a free marker
can do that. You colnlnics are all alike,

Mike: But guys,1 don't think you understand.
Ifwc don't all own up to our actions and do
what’s in the best interest of the community,
then selrtgoyernance is dead.

Wyatt' Hold on all the time I’ve been here,
people have been talking about selftgm'etnance

actually works pretty well.
We're all mature adults
that can handle such res
sporrslbllrty That doesn’t mean there aren't
problems, but we don’t need to get overly drae
matie every time someone makes a stupid de
cision. I do agree, though, people need to stop
taking our booze.
Tim: So, no dictatorship?
Mike: No.
Wyatt: And no aornbics>
Mike: Deﬁnitely not.
Tim and Wyatt: Then shut up, Mikel

The Grille is getting hot

Dear grille Customers,

It's 7:50 am, there’s a line oflibout 20 euple
wanting breakfast before their gain. and
you’re short with me. With me?! Since when do
I have ltny control over how many people come
to the Grille at one time? Since when do I have
any control over when Outtakes are open? Since
when do I hlwc control over what we do and do
not sell? Oh, and to the girl who always orders a
smoothie at 7:50, with those 20 impatient people
behind her damn you. Don’t order something
that takes ti ve minutes and then get mad that
we’re “slow" and make everyone wait. Seriously,
could you try to hold offbeing selﬁsh until after

, breakfast? I have to be at work before 7 atm.

could you all be a little more patie1‘lt,please?

Going to ‘hell in an ashtray

What happened to the cigarette butt deposi-
tories on South cam pup The other day as I went
to toss a hutt' into a fiitiiliar depository outside of
Loose, it appeaied that said depository was invis-
ible, leading in: to believe that I was actually' in
bizarro world. Upon closer inspection i noticed
that the little metal bowl had been removed from
the wall, Does some authority ﬁgure want us to
litter open more? I thought Grin nell College was

, all about being green hippies or whatever. Srrre,1

can toss my cashed butt into it trashcdn or on the
ground, but there’s little to no satisfaction' in den
ii-ig so.1 want to be able to angrily smash my butt
out in a metal bowl, so bring those met‘rll bowls
back or Ill poo my pants hardcore.

Senior wisdom not dated

Being here tor three years, we have noticed a
lick of Gtinncllians going on dates. We :ickliuwh
edge that as a campus Communirv, we are often
awkward and quick to label social interactions.
Howeve'r,wouldn't ‘it be nice tojust go out to dinner
or- a movie sometime? No expectations, no worries
about gossip, just a date. Plus, going out in town .
gets you off campus and helps support the local
husincs. s, So go find someone you want to spend
some time with, and ask them out. You’ll enjoy it.
