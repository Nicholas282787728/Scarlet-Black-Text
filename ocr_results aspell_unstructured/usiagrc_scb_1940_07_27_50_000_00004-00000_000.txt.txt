0 T0 STUDENTS, FACULTY AND
FRIENDS OF GRINNELL COLLEGE

I have been asked by the editor of the Som-
lct and Black to write a word of greeting to
all of you in anticipation of the opening of
another academic year at Grinnell college.
Since I shall be a new face and a new fac-
tor on the campus as the sixth president of
the college, it seems only fair to me that I
should, in greeting you, express my faith ill
Grinnell and in you.

I believe in higher education for as many
young men and women as have the ability
to profit from it. Not every boy or girl who
graduates from high school should go to a
college such as Grinnell. The freshmen env
tering the college this fall have been more
carefully selected than ever before in Grill-
nell history. We believe that you young
men and women have the mental ability, the
intellectual curiosity, the social purpose and
the bright ideals which fit you for four
years of creative experience on our campus.
The opportunities of higher education which
you shall take advantage of will produce
rich and exciting experiences, designed to

produce habits and attitudes which will'

make for more successful living in the years
ahead.

I believe in the value of a broad cultural
education as the fundamental groundwork
upon which one can build his special inter-
ests and vocational aspirations, The best
preparation that I know of for making,a
living is one which develops a capacity for
self-discipline and self—direction and, in ad-
dition, brings about a higher level of cri l-
cal judgment, with a deepening insight into
the nature of the world and people. The
purpose of a broad cultural training is sat-
isfactorily realized when these objectives
are secured.

As I see it, a man’s life is like a pyramid,
the broader and deeper the foundation, the

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

higher the structure may be pointed. When
the foundation is shallow and narrow it can
support only limited extensions. Let us hope
that the traditions of a liberal education
which have developed at Grinnell will be
perpetuated and enriched, in order that we
may have a significant experience of
growth.

I believe ill Christian education. Knowh
edge in and of itself does not produce char»
acter. Knowledge may become a deteriorat-
ing influence on the individual and a de»
structive force in society. A school, in the
long run, must be judged primarily, not by
the quality of knowledge which its research
authorities discover, but by the quality of
character which its graduates possess. I
am personally colnmitteed to the idea that
the Christian philosophy of life, with its
emphasis on the wol‘htwhilencss of the ill-
dividual personality, and the ultimate powv
er of love and good-will to overcome evil
and selfishness, is the only one which can
bring peace, beauty and truth to the modern
world. Consequently, I believe that our ed—
ucational purposes at Grinnell college will
have failed miserably if, in addition to the
strengthening of ones’ intellectual powers,
they do not at the same time assist men and
women in arriving at a stronger and more
dominant working faith in the Christian
way of life.

May each of you grow ill stature and
wisdom this y ar. May you have real joy in
our common life togethcrl In our little cor—
ner of the world, let us preserve the virtues
of honesty, good taste alld good fellowship.
Let lls work together in a democratic fashi
ion, to achieve for each other the largest
experience of personal growth, wisdom and
social understanding.

Count on me to work with you as It pm't-
ncl' in our great enterprise. Together we
may achieve our objectives and bring new
glory to Grinncll.

—Samucl N. Stevens, President

0 THE DEMOCRATS GODSESTEP

During the past seven years the condemnau
tion of the totalitarian state in all its valy»
ing forms has become increasingly popular
in republican America Alld since the out-
break of the current European war, dicta»
tors, their cohorts and their philosophies
have rapidly grown into the premier demo-
cratic aversion. Never,llever, say we with
the British, shall our nation compromi
with the aims alld techniques of these inte A
national brigunds.

But how futile om' pious protestations
appear in the light of the developments at
the recently concluded Democratic national
convention.

For here only one word can be adequate,
ly descriptive: dictatorship. Dominated ill
its entirety by Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
unwilling even after eight years to l'elil‘iv
quish the power he has accumulated as
President of the United States, the national
convention of the Democratic party has
joined the German Reichstag in its surreni
der of the prerogatives of a free political
assembly. Taking its orders from the G061"
ing of the Roosevelt machine, the conven-
tion swallowed in rapid succession 21 White
House-dictated platform, presidential nonl-
inee and vice-presidential candidate.

Thus has the totalitarianism so hateful to
free America been projected into the very
midst of our political arena-an added chal-
lenge to ollr democratic trad ion.

In his remarkable eighteyear reign, Roos-
evelt has fastened his rule upon the Demo-
cratic party and very nearly upon the na-
tion, Now the effort is being made to ac
centuate and extend this onerman system
for reasons of party politics masquerading
in the guise oi? national policy

Therein lies a challenge to the American
citizenry For while it may be true that we
are not yet upon the immediate brink of
authoritarian rule, it is equally true that an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure. Fortunately, America is still free to
take that ounce of preventionifrce to reg—
ister a thundering ‘NO’ to Mr. Roosevelt’s
plea for a third term.

And if she does not, let her be not aston-
ished if history should register an inglorious
'finis’ to her republic.
