This Weekend,

'IVHSSOURI, NEBRASKA NEET

Drake Tackles Navy at Annapolis
Today; Wisconsin Takes
011 Kansas U.

Although only one conference game
is on the schedule for the ten teams of
the Missouri valley, nevertheless eight
of the conference members will swing
into action today against conference
or non-conference opponents, Grinnell
and Kansas Aggies are the only teams
who will rest today, and both having
received rather severe setbacks last
week, should welcome the opportunity
of recuperating and preparing for
hard battles of next week end.

The one conference game of the
group will be staged at Columbia this
afternoon when the Nebraska Carn—
huskers, conquerors of .Iowa State
last Saturday at Lincoln, will meet
Coach Henry’s Missouri Tigers. Mis—
suuri demonstrated last week end that
they were to be considered as one of
the most powerful teams in the mid-
dle west when they turned back the
strong Kansas Aggie eleven by a 13 to
0 count. Captain Flamank of, the
Tigers proved to be the shinging light
of the game, accounting for all of his
team’s points. An addition to smash-
ing through the heavy Aggie line for a
number of long gains, the Missouri
leader circled the ends, tossed and re-
ceived passes in sensational fashion.

Missouri Letter Men Buck.

Missouri possesses a squad which
embraces eighteeen letter men from
last year’s powerful aggregation. such
an array of mlent in addition to one of
the most likely looking fresh teams in
the history of the school, bodes well
for Tiger hopes for a Valley grid title.
Last year after being in the race all
the way, the Tigers were turned back
by Kansas in a sensational unset.

' Nebraska set Coach Workman's
Ames gridsters on the bottom of the
Valley heap along with Oklahoma Ag-
gies, Griunell and Kansas Aggies by

VARSITY'DEFEATS
FROSH GRIDSTERS

Locke, Reserve Back, Stars In En-
counter With Yearlings.

In a. loosely played game between
the varsity and frosh teams last night
on Ward field, the varsity ran over
three touchdowns on the yearlings to
Win by a 20-0 count, Evahn making
good two of his attempted trys for ex-
tra point.

Although several of the regulars
were missing from the lineup because
of injuries, the regulars attacked the
frosh line with good effect at most
Stages of the game, and in addition
Succeeded in turning back all of the
freshman rushes eXCept during the
closing minutes when the frosh were
playing against it practically inexpcre
ienccd regular team.

The unexpected showing of Jack
Locke, reserve varsity fullback, Wits
the sensation of the game, the husky
junior running through the [rush line
and circling the Wings for a. number
of line gains. In addition he proved
his worth by backing up the line in
faultless fashion. Locke is at the
present time ineligible for varsi
competition, but this difficulty 's e).-
rented to be removed within two
weeks, enabling the powerful back to
join the Pioneer squad on the Mar-
quette trip.

Alex, Humphrey, Douglas and Let
ton were outstanding in the fresh
ranks. Alex and Douglas in the back-
field accounted for practically all of
the frosh gains, and in addition played
fine defensive roles.

Humphrey and Letton on the line
performed brilliantly at times in step-
ping the varsity drives through that
sector. Humphrey broke through on
many plays to Smear the regular bucks
for losses, and Lctton, who is perhaps
one of the smallest linemen on the
squad, did likewise on may occasions.

Frosh Party To Be

“Raffles,” a llmv starring Jcllll
l3ar -norc, news reels, and a coincdy

Forensic Elects
Payne and Mack

Forensic Society Seeks to Bring
Delta Sigma Rho Chapter
To Grinnell.

Charles E. rayne, professor of his
tor-y, and w. Harrison Mack, acting
professor of English, were elected
members of Grinnell Forensic at n,
special business session of that body
held in Smith bail club room last
Wednesday night. These men Were

Choose Committee.

A committee composed of RObEI‘t
_B\lrlingflnie, chairman. Elton Follett

complete the work which was begun
last year in the pl‘exlarzltlon of a. hiSr
tory of (‘rrlnnell's forensic activities
which is necessary for the petition to
Delta Sigma Rho for a chapter in
Grinncll college.

Delta Sigma Rllo is the leading na-
tionai honorary debating fraternity in
the United States, Only colleges and
universities of outstanding character
are eligible for chapters. The char-
acter and extensiveness of Grinuell’s
debating schedule is shown in partici-
pating in such debates as With Har-
vard, Oxford. Cambridge, Nebraska
and probably a Canadian university.

Negotiations are under way with
several universities for debates on the
1928 schedule. The question for the
Merrill debate series will he announc-
ed soon together with the schedule.

the SCARLET AND BLACK tryouters,
held, seven o'clock Thursday evening,
that following the third tryout issue

one individual. '

“Captain Applejack” Is Enlivened
By Romantic Complex of Bachelor

When an extremely respectable Eug-
lish bachelor suddenly begins to mine
glue that every time he enters a rail-
ioad carriage the ladies modestly lowe
or their eyes, when he begins to sense
a latent power within him and decides
that he needs a change. then trouble
is afoot Such is the predicament of
little Ambrose Allplejolin, would-he
hero of “Captain Applcjack," a comedy
by Walter Hackett which (he Dramatic
club will present for Homecoming.
Add to this newly-found romantic
complex a snug hearth fire in Corn-
wall, a bcautiful Russian adventuress
with a soft accent, a mystic with pen-
etrating eyes, and the result is the
stuff that dreams are made of. But
Applcjohn is a resourceful man, asleep
or awake. When he decided to give
up the ancestral Appleiohn home and
answer the "lure of the open road~
the gypsy quarter of Sevilleimoon»
light in Tangier," he was ready to

meet anything. Not even a pirate
crew could dissuade him.

The identity of thc bloodthirsty pi-
ratc band that will slash its way
through the second act of the Home-
coming play was revealed this morn
ing by ottilic Turnbnll Scybolt, direc-
tor. placid as their names may look
in print, there is not a lily-liver in the
gang. They are a stone-hearted crew
who thrive on hard tack and bluntl—
flavorcd filo. Midnight plank \valklngs
and dagger bouts serve to break the
monotony of their sea roving life.
They are as coldrhlooded a band of
Cutethroats as ever sailed under the
skull and cross-bones. The crew in-
cludes: Donald Fesslei', Cornelius
Boer-sum, Brewster Woodburp, llenry
Bray, paul Kiesel, Russell Smith, Hare
old Barr-is, Lyslc Hartley, James na-
vies, and Wilbur Cannon.

Cannon, who comes to Grinnell from
Pomona, will also understudy the lead.

 

Spiritual Life Is
Neglected—Steiner

Tells ”Y” Thunsday Its Purpose
Is to Preserve Christian
Ideal In College.

“To preserve the ideal of the Chris
titan life in college is the primary ob-
ject of the Y. M. C. A.," said Prof E.
A. Steiner in :t tztlk given Thursday
evening at the first open meeting of
the "Y,"

“When the college was started, and
tar many years thereafter, religious
life was held to be just as important
as athletics or scholarship. Now the
condition is changed," said Mr, Stein-
er. “To a considerable extent, we dis—
regard the value of spiritual life, and
place most of the emphasis on schol-
arship and athletics."

“After all, the important thing in
life is Christianity. It is not necessary
for great crowds to attend the Y. M.
c. A. meetings, but it is necessary that
those who do attend display a real
earnestness of/splrlt,"

It was twenty-five years ago that
Dr. Steiner first entered Grinnell col-
lege as an instructor. It was just
twenty-five years ago last Thursday
that he gave a talk before the “Y" at
the first meeting of that season. Mr.
Steiner remarked at the coincidence
that one of his first students, Mr. De-
Witt C. Sprague, attended the meeting
twentyeflve years ago as a student and
this year as an instructor at Grinnell.

Music at the meeting Thursday con-
sisted of several violin Selections by
Darwin Newton with Kate Palmer as
accompanist.

Lantern Asks For _
Speech Assistant

Appeals to Trustees That Fifty
Students May Not Have To
Drop Courses.

The action of the executive Commit
tee of the crinnell college board of
trustees last Tuesday evening in vot-
ing down a proposal to add a third in—
structor to the speech department was
followed by a petition objecting to the
dccision on the part of the Lantern,
representative organization of leaders
in campus activities.

The Lantern sent letters to every
member of the executive committee
asking that they reconsider the decle
sion, since the lack of a third speech
instructor would compel nearly fifty
students to drop speech and take some
other subject.

in asking for reconsideration of the
action the Lantern committee ex—
pressed itself as confident that, "The
full facts could not have been before
your body (executive committee) when
the request for an additional speech
instructor Was refuse

The last and summarizing para-
graph of the Lantern reads as fol-
lows: "Lantern is confident that it
speaks for all the men of Griunell col-
lege when it presents this appeal to
you for an additional speech teacher
and for the resumption of all discon-
tinued courses in public speaking."

A meeting of the curriculum com-
mittee to discuss means by which
freshmen and Sophomores desiring to
retain their speech courses might be
accommodated was called for 1:15 Fri-
day afternoon.

Freshmen Write Home About Honors
Gained by Making English X Class

”Dear folks, nlitde English X to-
day." “Dear child, glad to hear it,
we are both very proud of you," Per-
haps if We should glance into some
envelopes we might find these very
words.

English it is in a class by itself. On—
ly the picked students are allowed to
be present at any of its sessions. All
those that are not picked are boasted
out, unless they ilct real nice, then
they might be able to get in.

There are four classesand they are
all full. This shows the great talent
that We have in the class of 1931.

Meetings are held 1130 and 2:30 on
bull] Mondays and chncsdays. The
public is cordially invitcd if it wants
to come.

The class uses two tuxt books,
"Woollcy’s Handbook of Composition,"

 

and “The High School Spcllcr." The

latter book might be substituted by an
“Eishth Grade Speller," to help some
of the weaker X's along.

if the student body of this popular
course continue to increase a new and
larger home might be necessary for
them. With proper petitions, we
might get negotiations under way for
the beautiful red barn which is not far
off the campus.

For those, however. who are not
"kicked" out of class by November 22,
special graduation exercises will be
held sometime in January. Arranger
monts will be made later for the usual
commencement crowd that is on
hand. The crowd is usually a pretty
nice fellow.

No . lvcr cups, scholar-ships or none
or "Gs” will be awarded this year to
if students, even though they did win
over a field of somc three hundred cn-
tries.

Payne Elected As
Associate Editor
Grinilell Tanager

Prof. Clinrlcs E. Payne, chat man of
the history department at Grinnell,
has been elected as an associate odi-
tor of the Tanager to fill the unexpired
term of Miss Evelyn Boyd, who has re-
signed. The election of Mr. Payne by
the English department is understood
as a recognition or the Tanager's hav-
ing outgrown the limited function of
a mere departmental organ. Recent
issues of the Tanager have been quote
ed in a number of metropolitan papers,
including the New York TIMES, the
Chicago Daily NEWS, the Chicago Eve
ENING POST, the Omaha WORLD»
HERALD, and the Des Moiues REGISe

Swimming ls Made
Requirement Here

Beginning With Sophomore Class
Every One to Graduate
Must Swim.

Ability to sprint will be arenuire
ment for graduation, beginning with
the present sophomore class,‘ the fac-
ulty decided in El. meeting Monday af-
ternoon. Before graduation each stu—
dent must be able to float, tread water,
and Swim furty yards with a Stroke
satisfactory to the instructor.

“A noneswimnler can learn to swim
in twenty minutes if he will drop off
the pool diving-board head first, come
to the surface by xii-clung his back,
and then be towed to the side of the
pool,” Fruf. T. B. Turner, swimming
instructor, asserts. “Anyone who can
learn to swim at all can learn in three
lessons,"

Turner Proves Statement.

Mr. Turner’s statement was proved
last June at the high school Christian
Endeavor conference in Grinnell. A
girl who couldn’t swim volunteered to
drop in head first from the board, and,
ignoring Mr. Turner’s intentions of
towing her out, paddled to the edge
of the pool herself. She learned to
swim without even meaning to.

Life-saving became a pastime at the
pool last spring. Twenty-eight senior
lll'eesnvers, three juniors, and six life~
saving examiners were passed during
the year. John Turner, one of those
to pass the senior test, saved a drowne
ing man’s life this summer.

The pool is financially an independe
ent institution. like the School of
Music. it is supposedly self-support
ing, although the three-dollar fees re-
quired of students and faculty mem-
bers who want to swim aren't enough
to. keep the pool» financially above
water.

Organized In Classes.

Swimming this year is organized in
classes, with regular instruction.
Stunts. games, diving, and swimming
all come in the class period. Mr. Tur-
ner is trying to catalogue thc ability
of each swimmer. so that progress
may be noted.

Faculty members may join regular
classes, but Tuesday cvening is re-
served for them especially. A class
for facility women may be arranged
for Friday morning.

intramural swimming contests for
men will be planned later in the year.
A va ty team will be put into shapc,
but it is too early for Mr. Turner to
know much about the prospects.

To Continue Campaign.

Due to the delinquency and neglie
gence of students and faculty in mak-
ing their pledges, the committee has
decided to conduct the drive through
next week, terminating it Saturday
morning. The failure to meet the needs
of the Pioneer chest means that the
apportionment for each organization
in the chest will have to be cut several
hundred dollars. Crinnell—in—China,
instead of receiving $2300, her original
allotment, Will have to go through ‘28
and '25 on a greatly diminished capi-
tal. The Y. M. c. A. and Y. W. c: A.
organizations on the campus will suf~
fer.

Pledge cards are available from
committee members in the dorms and

pledges Will be given those who Wish
to give to the chest, so that-the pres-
ent status of the chest can be improv-
ed.

PECK AND KAYSER
WILL EDIT DORIC

To Have Column 0pm For Contribu-
tious From All students.

Howard Peck and Cleo Kayser have
been appointed editors of Doric, the
SCARLET AND BLACK humor col-
\lmn. Both have been active in jour-
nalism at Grinnell and have had con-
tributions in tlie Malteasei- and Cole
lege Humor.

The appointment or both a man and
a woman to edit Doric is in conform<
once with the plan to have both sides
of the campus represented.

It is the iutcution ol the editors to
refrain from making the Doric a catty
column, but rather to have it one of
locul and general humor. They would
also like to inaugurate the plan, slic-
cessftuly wo -cd out in R. H. L.'s Line
in the Chicago TRIBUN , of having
students adopt pseudonyms and cone
tribute to Doric any time they wish
under those names. Besides general
humor, only contributions or a friende
1y personal nature will be printed.
Contributions may be given or sent to
either Howard Peck or Cleo Kstyser at
