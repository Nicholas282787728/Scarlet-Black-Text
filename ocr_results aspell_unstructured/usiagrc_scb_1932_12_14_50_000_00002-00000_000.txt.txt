‘BIG SHOTS’

After reading the recent editor-
ial comment ill the Daily O’Col-
legion, Oklahoma A. and M. news-
paper, we only hope the opinions
stated therein are those of the pa
per instead of the student body ill
general.

If they are the latter—we fil'lnr
1y believe the Aggies should he
asked to leave the Missouri Valley
conference—o loop which appar-
ently is very much below the cali-
ber of thc Cowboys—whether or
not they receive tlleir hoped for
membership in the Big Six.

As a matter of fact, the Aggie
scribe crime to feel tlle same
way about i We quote:

“Regardless of our chances for
entrance into the Big Six, we
favor withdrawal from the Mis-
souri Valley. It is a Conference
which has but little to offer us.
The schools are small, most of the
teams are weak . Unable to join
any other, free lanclng would have
advantages over belonging to this
moribund (they spelled it lnor
blind) organization.

“While we are one of the few

M. V. teams which are not pnslir
overs for any good team, all of
the Big Six aggregations arc teams
to be respected by the fee.”

We don’t argue that the 00in
boys aren't goodﬁbut the state-
ment that most of the Valley
teams are pushovers is another
matter.

Valley teams came out on top in
two out of three Big Six conflicts
this year. The \Vashington Bears
defeated Missouri alld the Aggies
took Oklahoma university. The
only Big Six triumph came when
Iowa State trounced the unlucky
Drake eleven for the first time in
several years, The Bulldogs are
not ordinarily noted for being
push overs for the average good
teams.

The Aggies themselves have not
been especially outstanding in the
Valley in recent yeal They fill»
ished close to the cellar ill basket
ball last year, and their strength
ill other sports can hardly be judg-
ed since they meet comparatively
few Valley opponents.

The Aggie editor seems to have
developed a. bad case of swelled
head just because of the success-
ful Oklahoma grid season just
closed.

ALI. COLLEGE REVEW

“In the good ole days” is all
exasperating phrase to American
youth and to underclassmen in
Grinnell but that phrase seems the
only means of reawakening inte‘
est in a decadent Grinnell institu-
tionvthc Pioneer Pl‘lltlltles.

Three years ago next February,
the dormitories and cottages were
teeming with activity. Pl‘cpfil’
tions for the 1930 Pioneer Pl'tltllr
ties had begun. Dainty feminine
feet were beating l-ytllmie meas-
ures on the concrete floors. Hunch—
ed over large, colorful, flats were
the artists deftly dabbling here
and there with paint and brush.
Typewriters busily tattled the
script. The spark had caught and
the ﬂames were roaring through
the dorms and cottages. The Pio-
neer Prudities of 1930 were under
way.

The blﬂtikllCSS and cold of Win-
ter had surrendered to the glaiilor

and warmth of the prndities. It
seemed not at all long until tho big
night had arrived.

The doors of the Colonial theatre
swung open to the excited crowd.
There, were even new I gllt bulbs to
fill empty soullcts ill thitl spacious
lilollnmullt to dramatic art. The
hi ,2 of prerenl'tain conversation
died into a mumblc and before the
audience began tllc parade or in].
ellts.

“Quad do leiit‘ “Noah's
Lark”, Dibllle’s illodcrll joust ‘5,
mid the SillitlirCottilge Five melo-
drama were greeted with clllin-
Ol‘OuS applause. From laughter to
psucdorteal-s and b t to laughter
went the ol'liwd’s'ciimtion. The
bomb was burst and the slllapllel
scattered everywhere to become
hnppy memories in the hem-ls of
all.

There hull been grief and rrit -

cismihut for the same reason that
all art is tnilliellilllolley luattcl-
More \lr spent to produce ll \‘Vlll-
ller than the vietoriolm received
as first prize. The Pioneer Pmdir
tics failed to withstand those
blm s and another Gl'innell inst ,
tution is buried ill the newspaper
files.

PUNCH A TIME. CLOCK
(Dally Trojan)
, An appreciation of the value of
time is one of (be nnost important
assets college students can have. It
is usually found that those who real-
ize the significance of the fleeting
minutes and keep a close estimate on
‘thelxl turn not to he the young men
and women who lead the best bal-
anced lives. In punching as they do,
their mental time—clocks, they man-
age to get in a full course of study,
enter into campus activities, enjoy
social affairs, and still set aside a
definite daily period for leisure and
rest.
l This ability to budget the hours on
campus as a business man would bud—
get his books, comes from a Con-
esciousness of responsibility to one-
self. It's not whether a student spends
all morning in the library pouring
over print, or sits up all night bend-
ing over an assignment that is to be
considered, but rather how quickly
and effectively the work was done
within the least required time. The
secret of making one's university
days Well-rounded and pleasurable lies
a great deal in knowing how to ap—
portion the rniuutes advantageously
so that one may experience all sides
to campus life. After all, it isn’t the
hours that are put in but what is put
into the hours that counts.

A' DEFENSE

(st. Louis News)

Mon and women in our American
universities are not, as the comic
strips, movies and theatre would like
to portray thorn, light—headed, shilly—
sbally idlers who spend their time in
speakeasiss or in idolizing athletic
heroes. But rather are they, for the
most part, students whose minds are
occupied with subjects far more seri-
ous perhaps than are those of their
critics.

Outsiders see us only as we are
when we attend football games or
social affairs, but who can blame us
for becoming enthusiastic when our
tearns are winning or for enjoying
ourselves at a dance? Would not any-
one of our age, unless he were excep-
tional or unnatural, act just as we
act under the circumstances ? At those
times, we should not be classi ed as
,college students, but merely as young
men and young Women,

When we are in the classroom, at
a time when our critics never see us,
then we may be called college or uni-
versity students. Outsiders never see
us during our recesses between classes
when we get together and discuss our
studies and other important prob-
,lems that the great majority of them
'wili never be able to discuss.

Of course, there are exceptions to
i this rule, there are so-ca’iled “college
:boys" in our midst, but you will find
:idlers or shirkers in every walk of
‘iife.

t The scathing criticism to which we
are subjected prompts us to ask
whether our censors are actuated by
jealously or whether they are just
guilty of rash judgment.

1 We must remember that although
‘a group of men may go through the
same preparation for a particular
task, there will be no two alike. You
see all about you everyday an the
campus men and women who are be-
ing given exactly the same instl'uCr
tion that you are getting. some of
these men and Women will turn out
to be finally great successes, and
some of them will be just as com—
pletely failures.

This cannot be due altogether to a
difference of opportunity if we pre—
suppose the same curriculum for
everyone in the university who will

another, and that each one had the
same chances. or course the process
of distribution anti the fateful quirks
of environment may make or break
a certain number, but there are those
who will come out on top no matter
what environment they land in.

An emergence from school is like
the blossoming ﬂower. Up to the time
of graduation everyone is more or
less equal—at least the same oppor-
tunities have been placed before ev-
eryone. The difference in the whole
question lies in the judicial utiliza-
tion of these opportunities by the
various individuals. Only a few will
be great successes, although a gnaat
many were exposed to the same pro»
seas of preparation. This undoubtedly
must be due to a superior quality in
the original product or a more com-
prehensive accumulation of quality
during the process of preparation.
There has to be some factor that
makes the superior stand out, and
the factor of prcof under trial is the
one most universally used.

tentative approval of President M,
