Fuel Shortage Tightens Travel

WASHINGTON, D.C -—Students pl-
anning to fly during the Christmas
season will discover that there
are fewer airline flights, and that
tickets are costlier than in previous
years.

The situation is caused by a com-
bination of the energy crisis and
the Civil Aeronautics Board (can)
decision last year to eliminate air~
line youth discount fares.

President Nixon announced Nove-
mber 7 in his energy statement
that a number of domestic air fl-
ights will be out in order to save
fuel. Most major carriers indic-
ate that this cut will be about 10%.

in his second energy messageSun-
day, Nixon announced that jet fuel
allocations for domestic carriers

will be cut 5 per cent below 1972
levels December I. That cut will
be increased to 15 per cent below
1972 levels on January '7.

Youth Fares

Earlier this year, the can an-
nounced its decision that youth and
family discount fares are “discri-
minatory and unreasonable." The
fares were ordered eliminated on a
schedule which began June 1 and will
end June I of 1974.

On June 1, airlines were required
to eliminate part of the youth dis-
count. Airlines currently offer no
more than a 22 per cent reduction
on youth standby iares, and a 17
per cent reduction on youth reser-
ved and iamily plan fares.

Tomorrow, those discounts Will
be cut again, The maximum dis-
count ior youth standby will drop
to ll per cent, while the maximum
for youth reserved and tamiiy plan
fares will fall to 8 per cent
In addition, an across—thornoard
5 per cent increase in all domes,
tic air fares announced recently
by all major carriers will go into
effect tomorrow This change will
mean that youth fares during this
year's Christmas travel seasonwill
total, at most. 6 per cent under
the standard adult fares in effect
a year ago.

Most airlines employ a weekend
“blackout" system, which elimine
ates discount tares during the peak
weekend ﬂight period The speci-
fic regulations vary irom carrier
to carrier.

Reserve Space Early

CAB officials recommend that stu-
dents make reservations for nights
as soon as possible. They note
that this advice is especially im-
portant this year, when the fuel
pinch is being leit during the big-
gest travel rush period of the year.

They also advise students to pay

the extra 3% required to reserve

a seat, noting that the added cost
is nominal compared to the poten-
tial lost time.

(In Grinneu, a spokesperson tor
the Grinnell Travel Center agrees
that students planning to fly home
from Grinnell should reserve space
early.

She notes that reservations are
still fairly easy to obtain for the
period from now until Deoeniberla.
However, from December 15 until
New Year's Day, reservations are
already difficult to obtain

30 nattey, local spokesman ior
Greyhound Lines West, says that
he has no knowledge oi any sche-
dule Changes that would affect Ch—
ristmas travel plans.

Battey said Monday that unless
conditions change drasticauy, he
does not forsee any major schedule
alterations before mid-January,
1974.

However, Battey urges students
planning to use busses during the
Christmas season to buy their tic—
kets early and list their departure
dates at the Greyhound station to
insure that adequate bus space is
available.)

Fight Increases

At least three groups are fighting
the live per cent across-theboard
air fare increase which is taking

Ralph Nader’s Aviation consumer
Action project says the increase
is unnecessary, since the schedule
cuts already announced will result
in having more passengers on each
plane. This, the Nader group cl-
aims, will result in higher pro-
fits for the carriers, making any
fare increase needless.

In addition, the Nader group c1-
aims that the airlines have failed
to properly control some major
expenses, notably advertising and
general management salaries.

A third group, the Moss Congres»

Black Clusters Approved

Unaminity prevailed at the SGA
meeting Wednesday night in appro»
val of three separate reports from
the Social Policies and Regulations
Committee to the Joint Boards.

Following a short discussion SGA
approved (18-071) the Black Cluster
System to be put in effect for the
197445 and 1975—76 academic
years, The cluster system will
house those Black students, who
wish to participate in small groups
in various dorms on campus. Ac
cording to the proposal’s rationale,
"it is believed by us (the Social
Policies and Regulations Commit-
tee) that this atmosphere would
promote better adjustment to Gr—
innell by Black freshmen, the vast
majority ot whom come irom the
inner-city and have significantly
ditterent backgrounds than those
at the white entering freshmen."
In its implementation, the largest
concentration of clusters would be
on North Campus with at least one
cluster on South Campus,

Joint Boards also acted to put
some ”teeth" into the pet policyt

. Under the proposal approved (17.

0-0) the pet catcher will period-
ically police the campus and re-
port to the Pet Board all college

tagged pets not under leash or voi-
ce command of the owner. Owners
will then be fined 35,

The proposal also produced a vot—
ing mechanism that will allowdorm
floor the possibility of revotes on
pets if they so desire. The ballot
attempts to measure intensity of
feeling among the residents, but
maintains the principle that one
objection to pets is sufficient for
their exclusion from the floor.

A special prosecutor was created
by the Joint Boards who in con—
Junction with the Student Co~ordin~
ators office would receive Compl-
aints and information on damage
to college property. This is in
response to many incidents like
those following the James Hall
Gang Bang where extensive damage
occurred but no information was
forthcoming as to who was respon-
slble,

ting traﬂ'ic and actually reducing
revenue. The group claims that
revenue would increase if fare lee
vels were maintained or even re—
duced.

Congressional Action

Although youth fares are curren-
tly being phased out, the youth tare
issue is not yet dead.

Early this month, the Senate paSr
sed and sent to the House a bill
that would allow discount air fares
for standby passengers 21 years
old or younger and 65 years old
or older. The bill would also pro—
vide reduced reserved seat rates
for persons with physcial handi»
caps,

Although opposed by both airlines
and the CAB, which has ruled that
such fares are discriminatory, the
bill apparently has Wide support
in the House,

The measure has strong support
from the National Student Lobbyand
the Coalition for the Retention of
Air Discount Fares (CRADF), a gre
cup of more than 100 student and
senior citizens organizations.

Its backers say the discount fare
system provides a method of fillr
ing seats on airliners that would
normally be empty at very little
additional costs to air carriers,
while expanding travelopportunities
for people with limited incomes.

However, the House Interstate and
Foreign Commerce Committee has
been backlogged with other legis-
lation, and has not yet scheduled
hearings on the measure.

Grant Program Challenged

CEDAR RAPIDS, IAr—The Student
Association of the Iowa Community
Colleges voted November 17 to file
a lawsuit testing the constitution—
ality of the Iowa Tuition Grant Pro—
gram.

In voting to file the suit, the group
claimed that the program is uncon-
stitutional because it essentially
supports private colleges with state
tax money.

The Association says it will seek
funds and legal assistance from the
Iowa Civil Liberties Union in fil-
ing the class action suit.

The program was established by
the Iowa Legislature in 1969, and Is
currently funded at $12 million for
this biennium,

Under the program, Iowa students

enrolled at lowa's private colleges
and universities may apply for year
ly grants of up to $1000 to help
finance their education.

Backers of the program say that
students at Iowa's state universir
ties are already subsidized by the
state, and that the Program actuae
11y takes pressure off the state
universities by allowing students
to attend private schools.

IN GRINNELL, Dean of AdmiSSr
ions and Student Financial Aid D,
Nicholas Ryan said Tuesday that
41 of Grinnell’s 132 Iowa students
are currently receiving moneyfrom
the Program
He added that he does not think the
Association lawsuit will succeed in
eliminating the Program.
