Women’s group programs

by Bob Fisru:

Last winter, a Grinnell student
reported that she was raped on two
separate occasions. No assailant was
ever found, but the campus Women‘s
Group is taking steps to prevent a possi-
ble recurrence of such an incident.
These steps include the establishment
of the Escort Service and the Whistle
System, the former a continuation oi a
program begun last academic year and
the latter only proposed at present.

Male students on campus received a
flyer in their mail boxes recently. ask-
ing them to make themselves available
to act as escorts for women who need to
go somewhere on campus after dark.
The program, headed by Tracy Miller
and Lisa Sergienko has about 40 escorts
signed up. The names, telephone
numbes, and days and times these
escorts are available will be posted in
the principal study areas and on both
campuses. Among those signed up for
escort duty are an oil campus student
with a moped and a team or two women
who live in Gates Hall.

Miller and Sergienko said they wish
they had thought to stun the ilyers in
the women’s mailboxes. too. They and
Mary Schultze, who heads the Woman's
Group, stressed that people do not have
to be trained in Tae Kwon Do or Jiu Jit-
su to escort someone. The women said
that the goals of the program are to
deter potential attackers and to bring
peace of mind to escortees. They also
stressed that it is advisable for all
students outdoors after dark, male as
well as female,‘ to travel in pairs or
preferably in larger groups.

Although men are urged to become
active in Women's Group activities, the
women hope to see me time when a

woman's mobility will not be limited by
the availability of a man to escort her.
The are also hoping to be able to train
women to avoid or escape attack or,
barring that, deal effectively with an
attacker.

One of the concepts being studied in
the area of self-protection is the Whistle
System. Ellen McDonald, organizer of
the system, said that the system would
be modeled after one in effect at Col-
orado College, where women are issued
whistles which they carry on cords
around their necks. The whistles are
blown only if the woman is in danger of
attack by another person, male or
femalevor an animal. McDonald said
that the sound of one of those whistles at
Colorado College will empty anyrnear-
by building, with the erstwhile in-
habitants coming to the aid of the lady
in distress. , jgﬁﬁ

McDonald mentioned that the pro
gram is still in the preliminary plan-
ning stages, she still does not know the
cosLs involved in the project, and she
has yet to approach college ofﬁcials
and the Student Government Associa-
tion (SGA) for their necessary
assistance. She emphasized that the
College would have to issue regulations
requiring immediate response to a
whistle and preventing misuse of the
whistles if the program were to work.
