Comment

A great line and cry, accompanied by a monumental

*hing‘ of teeth, gushed forth from the Quadrangle last

ch as the League Board paced sentence on an unhappy

gimp of nrdlefactors. female in sex and Sad 01' countenance.

Last week also saw the departure under a cloud oi one

le from the North campus. Obviously something- had
amiss.

Rightly or wroir it has since time iinnlemorial been
t"e policy of this inst ution to muffle as expertly as pos-
smle the sound and in ‘ of its internal troubles. This publir

on has always followed the lead of the administration in

matters. On the present issue we do not- intend to
dlfler from said policy.

HOWEVER -

(mil. properly veiled) prose accounting of thing's.

Last week in the name 01' the imp Puck, a rule of the
Scuth campus was broken by one semircoliscious male and
something like three dozen females. No dark intrigue was
involved. personal morality was in no way involved. But
a rule \\'as nonetheless broken and, as one might well expect,
punitive action was absolutely lieccssarv.

It is cheedingly gratifying to us and will lie presumab-
ly to the entire student body. that our student governing:

'ation of action to actual sentencing: of those deemed

liiltr.

it must be used for the same
offense, regardless cl the means
oi the individual. However,
there arc some vcry wealthy
students at Grinncll. as well as
those who do not have a large
bank roll. As a result, it may
not be serious at all for some,
while disastrous for others.

Therefore, I suggest that the
fine be eliminated as a means
of punishment on this campus,
and instead, a penalty should
be substltuted that would be

,Roiiicking Farce Shakes ARH

Good characterization, ingenious satire, elaborate costumes, a
striking setting, much color and more noise were all combined in
the crinncll Cnllcgc Theatre’s successful presentation oi Julian
