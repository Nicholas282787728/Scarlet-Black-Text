Find act of stealing

iTubeless Revue—in concert

by Jeff Miller

Grinncll‘s own improvisatory
comedy group, The Tubeless
Blackwall Review, Will present “A
Bicentennial Salute" at mu p.m,
Wednesday, December 10, and
Thursday, December 11 in ARH

uditorium, The group, composed
of director Mark Anderson, Bryan

<Crockett, Christine Davidson,
gnthony Flinn, Maggie Laird, and

ill Waldner, performs skitsithis
time, concerning America’s
heritageibased on comedic

aterial improvised during

ehearsals. This IS the same
technique used by groups such as
Second City, The Committee, Bob
and Ray, and Monty Python, to
name but a few.

Being an inquisitive reporter, i
decided to take my tape recorder
and interview the members of the
group about their upcoming per.
lormance. i lirst approached
director Mark Anderson:
em: Where do you get the ideas
lor your skits?

MA: We usually steal them from
groups such as Second City, The

Qmmittee, Bob and Ray. and
i onty Python, to name but a low.
Much as you steal many ol your
columns lrom Woody Allen—r
_ JM: Ahiyes. Well, can you

cuss the cultural impact of your
upcoming bicentennial Show?

MA: You should talk with Chris
Davidson—she‘s our culture ex~
pert.

Since it was obvious that I
would get nowhere with Anderson,
I decided to follow his advice and
Set out in search of Ms. Davidson.
it was my understanding that she
was at a party at JD’s; however,
she had left by the time ! got there,

m i started to wander back to
mpus, As I turned on to High
reel, though, i discovered Ms,

Davidson~lying in the gutter,

clutching an empty bottle of

{larvey's Bristol Creme, and clad

ﬂ? somewhat soiled and crumpled
\ lte evening gown, a pair of
seulled silver slippers, and a
rhinestone tiara. She was mute
tering to herseliil Could un-
derstand bits and pieces~
“physical beauty," “transitory,”
“richness of spirit," “destitute
woman ” I tapped her on the
shoulder and asked if I might be of
assistance. She looked up at me
and sighed: “Whoever you are, i
have always depended on the

idness of strangers.“ She then
passed out. I decided there was

nothing further I could do, so I

lil‘iscated the sherry bottle and
aded back to campus,

‘ Tony Flinn was my next quarry,

and I found him at the library,
diligently reading Milton Berle's

ion! Old Jokes I Have Stolen. I

ﬁppmached him with the tape
recorder. and the following ex
change ensued:

JM: Hi, Tony. Care to discuss the
upcoming bicentennial Show?

TF: IS that (the tape recorder)
on?

JM: Yes Now about the—

TF: Is itireally on?

- t really is, Now~

FF Ohboyl! Hi, Mom! Hl,Dad!
Hey, where's the camera? Hi, Mr.
Funtl '

ilelt Mr Flinn running around

e library screaming something
about Durward Kirby being in the
Forum, I headed down to the Pub,
where I met Bryan Crockett, the
ﬁell‘sslyled ladies’ lrlan of the
group.

JM: Bryan—I was wondering if
you’d mind discussing the up»
coming bicentennial show . .

‘ BC: Right, Jell. I‘m six leet tall
‘and weigh a‘lean I43 pounds» I have

blonde hair, blue eyes. and rippling
muscles course throughout my
entire body. I play the sitar, cook
up a mean kische, and I like to Ski
and go deep-sea lishing. I’m
sensitive, very aware , . , .
Bryan seemed more interested
in talking to his reﬂection in the
cigarette machine than to me, so I
went back home to call Maggie
Laird, who was at her home,
recovering from an attack of gout,
JM: l-li, Maggie Is there
anything about the upcoming
bicentennial show you’d care to

minor one. As Mark Anderson put
it: “I sincerely hope that Bill
returns in lime to appear in the one
skitin which he has a role, albeit a
minor one.”

I would recommend The
Tubeless Blackwall Review‘s
“Bicentennial Salute” to anyone
interested in an evening or mirth
and merriment, even though they
wouldn’t tell me anything about it
(perhaps 1 should investigate a

new mouthwash). Perhaps the best
advice on what to expect comes
some selected reviews of their last

Qﬁgw and 02135th

discuss for the 5&3?

ML: Sex. [love sex, I dor’t care
when, where, why, how, or with
Whomijust give me lots of good
hot, raw, steaming sex. You name
it, I‘ll do it. Mmmmmmrnsex, sex,
sex. I LOVE itl!

Alter a quick cold shower,
twenty pushups, and Federalist
Papers 1710, I decided I was Calm
enough to go talk with famous
Grinnell theatre personality Bill
Waldner i discovered, however,
that Bill had been kidnapped by
some Extragalactic aliens in a
Time Escape Nodule, and thus was
unavailable for comment. It is
sincerely hoped that‘ Bill will
return in time to appear‘in the one
skit in which he has a role, albeit a

Monday night (December 1)
Clark Pit had a Christmas Party.
We made decorations for a tree
and had a good time as a lloor.
Someone had baked about [our
dozen cookies lor the party and we
also had bakery cookies. It was
really nice because we had a lot
leit over which we left in the lounge
loi- floor members to help them-
selves to. With ﬁnals coming on,
We felt it would be nice to have
cookies and tea and Coffee around
for study-break purposes.

Sometime between 2 a.m, and 7
am, someone decided to spoil our
plans. Someone decided to come
down and steal about three dozen
cookies.

No one on this floor understands
why someone would have done
this. It’s not the fact that we Can’t
eat them, it’s the idea that
someone could be so inconsiderate
as to steal lrom another group ol

We’ll probably never lind out

the mentality of stealing It is
incomprehensible to us, and ii a
