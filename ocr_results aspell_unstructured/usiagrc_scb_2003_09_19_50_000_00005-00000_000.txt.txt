Entering the room of Sam Gruenwald '07 is like mo-
menrarrly escaping Grlnnell, lowa, eirea zoos and step-

Nantucket Nectar jars and, to add a mud: of anachro-
msm, Bob Marley posrers reigning supreme.

This is {he mom ofan artist.

Gruenwald, drrgrnnlly horn NewvorkCiry, has already
made a mark for herselias an arrisr haek home. At the age
of 16, she landed lierxclfnn exhibition in the Locus Media
Gallery in rhe famous SeHo disrrier, attaining crltlul ac»
clztim for her crenlions. This achievement led to a featule

“I've been doing this Since I

nell, she plans ro srudy arr rurrher in eirher Parsons School
of Design or rerurn ro FIT,

“I already know I'm going ro be an nrrisr," she said.
“Tl-re reason why I'm in Grinnell is beuuse I want to ex-
pand my henrens and ger a good eduesrion." Besides arr.
Gruenwald 15 inreresred in philosophy and is learning sew
eral languages.

As for her gallery debur, she reyealed rhar she was nor
aerually diseovered. “My srepmom l l , was friends wirh
the gallery owner." she explained. This did nor srop her
hem producing a large rumour ro her eshibir and selling
one or her pieees.

In addirion re her love for reshien design, Gruenwald
dsbbles In many erher forms or dry
media, Including ehareesl, ink and
some collage. Much erher work {04
euses on figure drawing, whieh can be
seen in her wide array orsulsieers.

one or her drawings is era aooe
pound woman named Aviva, who
Gruenwald sailed, “the epireme nr

wirh her body," ridding, “She iusr loved
her body so rnueh and wss her so com-
rorrable." Anorher werk she is most proud ofis a drawing
ora Nariye American man, She round rhe dnwing difﬁe
eulr sinee she needed ro eaprure ell rhe creases in his brow.

However, she revealed rlrnr her rrvorire pieee is a pen
and ink done of her hm friend Erin. “1r wss very per,
send,“ she said. “Pen and ink is d very unforgiving me
drum, bur wrrh rhrs pieeo, everyrhing iusr earne rogerher.
and when I wss done. i was like, ‘Wow, rhars her.'"

Her passlon for drawing people extends mueh deeper,
as evident when Gruenwslrl waxes poerie about being an
errisr. “For an arrrsr, rhe hardesr perr is rhe translation,"
she srid. “I hsve ell rhese ideas in my head, bur sometimes
I iusr don’t know how ro pur them down. Then I see all
rhese orher people’s work, and i rhink ro myself, ‘That’x
esaedy whar I wanred ro dol’"

She also empheshed rhe need for mesning in arr. “Be-
fore, l used ro rhink whenever I saw rhe work ersomeone
like [lacksunl Pollack. yeu knew, 'Anyone can do rharl’”
However, her arrirude ehsnged once she began ro do more
art, and she realized rhsr all arr cannot be done wirhour
some form ormeaning, which explains why she yslues l-icr
perrrair orBrm. “A perrrair has re upturc rhe essence era
person," she said.

Gruenwald eoneluded rhar her persnnal philosophy
when ir enmes ru art is rhar “Everybody is heaurirul i
know ir sounds eheesy, bur everyone is beaurirul in rheir
ewn way. All bodies are beaurirul. That’s why i love dnwe
ing dirrerem kinds orpeople. imperreerions are gorgeous."

she plans ro ineerpur-rre rhis and her omer ideas in her
rurure m. “1 have rhis idea," she disdosed, “ermaking arr
in rhe dsrk. You know, where I would mske ir in rhe dark
and rhen exhibit in rhe dark, so rhareyeryone would have
to feel it."

She reels sure rhhr she will realize many or her amsne
goals. “I can’t nor draw," she said, “I’m eensranrly watch-
ing people and wishing i eould draw everyone i see," and
ror all rhose who sham her passion if nor her eonhdenee,
she suggesred, “Don't rhink, just draw "
