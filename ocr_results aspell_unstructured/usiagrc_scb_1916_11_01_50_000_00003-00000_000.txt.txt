limited to Splashing about in a bath
tub and dr ' g milk from a bottle;
the second, little Miss Lehl‘, who plays
“Ramona," at the critical moment of
her lile When she changed foster pil-
rents; and third, Miss Ado Gleason,
who impersonates the beautiful half-
hreed maiden in her maturity.

Miss Lehr is not only a Wonderlul
child with great black eyes, but is al-
so an accomplished little actress, and

Felipe is not apt to be forgotten by

era. "Aida." In Madame Sutherland we
have the representative dramatic con-
tralto of the premier republic cl South

of our neighbors in the far south, and
it may surprise those, who have not
visited these countries, to learn ihst
they are accustomed to hear more on-
era in the course of a year than most
countries, As an operatic artiste, Mme.
Sutherland has won her laurels in
roles of a diverse nature, having ap-
peared in leading parts at the greatest
opera houses 0! the world, Her versa-
tility in languages is most astonish-
ing, and it naturally follows that with
so large a scope at her Command, Mme.
Sutherland represents the most cosmo-
politan type it is possible to meet. It
may interest those who are seriously
contemplating the study of vocal art
