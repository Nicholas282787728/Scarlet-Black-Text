Slightly eccentric?

Nice guy? The greatest!

Ill these few sentences, one
01 his best friends would de-
scribe four-letter athlete and
cl‘ossecountl'y captain at Grim
nell, John Welden.

Asked what was the high-
light oi his athletic career. John
said, “I was never more exhilr
crated than the day when our
nulc- clay team. on winch I ran
the thl d log, won the Iowa col-
lcgc mile relay at the Drake
relays. i still have my number
splattered with the mud and
sweat or that race, and I’m sure
lnv teammates, Drake, Elliot and
Bacchus have kept theirs."

in addition to his athletic

activities, Welden has engaged

in a number or extra-curried
lar activitits. He has been an
active participant in the die
fair of KGKW, serving as

publicity director during 1956-

51. At the same ilime he heltl

the post oi treasurer of the

YMCA on campus.

President Bowen's appeal to
the collegian [or a more ideal—
istic approach when planning
the luture might well be turned
inside outﬁand presented to the
athlete. A bit of realism inject-
cd into the Sportsman’s mode
oi thinking today will show
him the way to a more sel(~
rewarding tomorrow.

Athletics are not all that tour
years ol college have to 036*
even to the man who seldom
thinks of anything clse. A [out
ball or basketball player or
swimmer will not reap that
which is most vital to success-
iul adulthood via his athletic
participation, What he gains
physically must‘ - evanescc in
importance. What he is prone
to gain intellectually while at
college will prevail as his..most
valuable extraction.

The question oi brain versus
brawn has been discussed tor
decades One is contemptuous
iy accepted by the other; but
both are valuable ioccts oi-
human development. In view
or the tact that our society
becomes more complex with
each new discovery we may
shrug ott neither one, Howu
ever. the athlete is too often
biased in his eraluation or
their importance.

We welcome this weekend as
a great cultural stimulus. rath-
cr than something that will dC~'
tract from the spirit ot Home
coming. Herc is an irrctragabic
association of sport and intellec—
tuaiisin. The Cornell game is
considered an intricate part of
Grinnell’s "Culture At Mid-
Century"; athletics are realized
as _an intricate part or Amert
can culture.

1 entreat (or challenge. if i
may) the athlete to accept this
opportunity to place sport and
culture in their proper por-
spectivcs.

.ior college levcl, is a history
major at Grinncil. He plans to
tpick up some necessary hours
’in education next summer, after.
which he will enroll in graduate
'school, probably at Wisconsin.

Any of Weldcn's teammates
‘can talk at length of his eccen-
h‘icitleihis unfailing habit of
bringing awav hotel-room keys
in his packets, his incredible
Ehabit of eating ‘Wheaties” at
all meals. his craving for candy
'bars and sweet rolls just betore
track lneets.‘and many other
;such “queer" customs.

; As secretary . treasurer or
Men‘s Honor 6, Welden is he-
ingkeptmore busy than usual
this year under the vigorous
administration oi the club's
new president. Since he is un-
happy unless engaged in some
such activity. one must con»
clude that between studies,
serving in various organizm
tions, and running cross-conic
try, Weltlen is either very
happy or too busy to care.

John Welden has epitomized
the spirit and courage of the
Grinneii athlete over the last
century and so long as Grinncli
college has athletes oi his calls
‘ble the standards will remain
high.
