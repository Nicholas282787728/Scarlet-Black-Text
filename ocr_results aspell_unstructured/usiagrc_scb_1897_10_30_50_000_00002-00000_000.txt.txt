We: HAVE recently received
from the publishers a copy oi
"Polyhymnia" a nerv collection of
quartette and choruses lor male
voices. It isicomplled and ar
ranged by John w. Tufts, a man
widely reputed tor advancing mus
sic study in the public schools.
It contains a large number ol
representative selections from the
works of the best authors, and,
though not difﬁcult they form a
good introduction the best musics
alliterature, Therearealso many
old songs with Charming new or»
rangements. In this collection
he seems to have sifted the quans
titles of part songs adapted to
male voices and retained only
that which could be well recnms
mended to high schools and grams
mar school, quartctts and glee
clubs.

THE FIRST number of Till: UNIT
'will be out Monday and is in some
respects quite gratifying to those
having an interest in the literary
department at our college. The
two stories, ”A Matter of History”
and“lsahelAllen's Resting Place”
both show considerable care in
writing. Considerable interest is
added to the former by the fact
that it is based on an actual occur
rence in our college, “tsabel Ale
len's Resting Place,“ an account
of an all too common experience
in western farm life. the quiet
tragedy of a woman's lite, is “done
in gray" with a very enccrual
touch. In the verse the usual
standard of college poetry is at
least equaled. The Unit and '
change departments give promise
of good conscientious work to.-
the year. As a whole the number
is deﬁcient in variety. While
quite readable for one numher it
will hardly (lo to continue the
present proportion of stories to
other departments. The Senior-
is especially missed. As we have

THE EDITOR of the Cur/MIMI”
in a recent lssuc devotes his edir
torinl page to a disetlssron of
Grinncll's athletic standing as
compared to her-literary ability.
The conclusion seems to be that
we are an aggregation of "once
sided monstrosities" with
thonghtsconcetitratedoiiathleties.
‘Grinricll certainly has made a plic-
iiomerial showing athletics,

our

in

of student enterprises successfully
carried out each year this fact has
not inter-(cred with symmetrical
development. Theonly victories
of which the Mount Vernonites
boast are tlrejoint debate and last
springs baseball game The de
cision in the torriier was due only
to the form in which the question
was stated and as to the latter
anyone who knows of the un-
runspor-tsmanlike treatment which
the vrsitlng team received on their
grounds must‘ wonder how any
seltrespectrng institution can
boast of it. The question is
then asked: “Now why is it
that Cornell not only displays
herself to good advantage in
the forensic arena lint in ath»
letics as well?" We admit that
such an achievement is remarks
able. HotvCo‘rnclIwhohasnever
been able to beat Grinnell's second
team at football, who never held
the silver bat, who could not win
a single point at the state track
meet last spring, can ﬁnd sufﬁcient
energy and material to carry on
their socrcty work certainly is a
brain racking conundrum.
