Watching the candidates

by Kevin Martin

“First choice ’76; A rally for the
candidates" was the theme of last
Friday’s Presidential candidate’s
rally in Waterloo. Will Collins.
Brad Gove, and this writer, along
With 1100 other Iowans, were in
attendance at the rally.

As the first state in the nation to
begin Presidential delegate
selection, Iowa has become the
nesting grounds in recent weeks
for many of the serious contenders.
Precinct caucuses take place on
January 19 and every hopeful
would love to carry a strong Iowa
showing back to New Hampshire
and Floridaithe next primaries.

audace Cropper gives him a

Friday at 8:00 pm. in Roberts Theatre.

Sargent Shriver was the ﬁrst
speaker and his delivery was
typical of all the rest. He set a tone
that was generally followed by all
of the candidates. He was vague,
rhetorical, a hit oi a backrslapper.
and uninspiring. ile made repeated
reierences to John Kennedy and
the Kennedys in general, which
was no surprise. Listening to his
remarks. i got the feeling that he
was really convinced that things
really are not that bad, and that all
we have to fear is ”fear itself." The
audience's response was
reassuring. Judging from the lack
of applause he received many
others present felt as I did.

Fred Harris was the next
speaker and I was giatit'ied to hear
a speech other than the one rd
heard him give twice before. When
introduced, Harris received the
only standing ovation given to any
candidate upon introduction. He
did spend too much early time
talking of his Pop, his Uncle Ralph
etc., but he brought the crowd to
life with such statements as “My
friends, we could not dream up a
system asking for more trouble
than the one we have now. A
system which places 40 per cent of
its people within $3,000 of the
poverty level and has 25 per cent
black unemployment is just asking
for trouble.” He specitically
pinpointed the country’s woeful
economic and monopolistic
policies. He was one of a few who
was specific in his attacks and
proposals. The crowd took it to
heart as evidenced by a straw poll
conducted later.

Morris Udall followed Harris and
his speech was keyed much lower.
He spent a good deal or time urging
party unity and support for the
eventual candidate. He leveled a
blistering attack on President
Ford‘s New York City policies, but
his quiet speaking manner was not
very persuasive, He promised a
job for everyone. But, his sort
proposal didn't seem too
illuminating.

Udall also linked himself to John
Kennedy. He suggested three
criteria tor choosing a candidate.

Jimmy Carter

One was by looking at his record,
another was the amount of courage
he had, and the last one was his
imagination. l. and the audience,
wanted more than that.

Former Governor Jimmy Carter
was the next speaker and he, like
Harris, received a warm welcome
from the audience. He devoted his
entire address to foreign policy and
had some interesting comments to
make one early statement that we
“should never again become in-
volved in other countries’ internal
affairs” drew long and loud ap-
plause, However, his oft repeated
belief that we have given in too
much to the Russians le him to
say, ”If we were ever weak
enough, given the chance, Russia
and China would certainly attack
us." Carter did speak convincingly
and no matter what he may have
been saying it was obvious that he
believed it from the depths of his
soul, but a politician he is not.

Birch Bayh, the Senator from
Indiana spoke last and l won-
dered what he could possibly do to
revive the now silent crowd. The
previous four speakers had worn
the crowd a bit thin with
monotonous diatribes. Bayh rose
above it. He spoke from few notes.
no prepared text, and was superb.
Where the others may have been
lackluster he Showed a sharp wit,
eloquent voice and delivery. He
spoke of the circular pattern in
which poverty breedsilrum
childhood in the slums, poor
schools, no job opportunities to
crime and then jail. He spoke out
against monopolies, big business,
fouled environment. He drew loud
and long applause throughout and
at the conclusion of his speech, but
I was again lett wondering where
his vague and limited proposals
would work better than those token
efforts of the past.

it was reassuring to hear that in
the straw poll the two candidates
who i thought addressed them-
selves most to the issues and were
more specific than the rest, Bayh
and Harris, finished 172, Bayh with
28 per cent, Harris with 22 per cent,
