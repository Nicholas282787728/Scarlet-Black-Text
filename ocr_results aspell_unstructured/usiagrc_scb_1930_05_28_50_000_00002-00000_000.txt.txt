THE MAY FETE.

Friday night the Women's athletic department pre-
sented an unusual combination of physical prowess and
athletic beauty. The performances must have required
an unusual degree of practice, adroitness, and physical
development.

Saturday afternoon brought another sort of display.
Those manly attributes of knotty muscles. tremendous
lung capacity. and a remarkable faculty for self-torture
were all on exhibition.

People have become accustomed to honoring the
virile sports. They are prone to forget that the gentler
pastimes 'make their devotees fully as healthy, happy.

THE COURAGE OF ONE'S CLOTHES.

Persons who have decried the drubness and unl- at the last formal senior chapel
morrow morning at ten o'clock. Thei
and -

formity of men’s clothes would do well to spend a fort—
night in one of America's smaller college town .
feast their eyes on the variety of styles and colors which
modern youth ﬁnds so necessary to its self-expression.
The campus of a mall’s college is almost as colorful as
a woman‘s. The blazer for juniors may be light green;
the senior blazers a year old may be suffering from a
deep purple. .

The collegian's suit runs toward the light shades of
gray. tan and cream; his shirt may be of any hue; his
tie is bright on the cloudiest day; his shoes. more often
than not. are a mixture of white and black or ten and
white; his golf hose defy classiﬁcation, and sometimes
description. He has learned to wear sweaters of dis—
tinctly feminine shades, and he changes his eifects fre-
quenuy. One day you see him all in white, a picture of
summer; the next he has decided on a new combination
which gives you a view of him from another angle. The
spectacle on the campus is a pageant of color desi .
The dark. conservative-suit is so much out of the ordi -
ary that his friends will ask him what is the occasion
for such formal wear.

And while campuses are swept by fads, the col-
legian scores something for independence from the fact
that many such vogues originate with himself. Such
for instance is the revolt which has just broken out in
one New England college against long trousers. While
the widespread adoption of shorts as a substitute at this
college may suggest a slavish following of the new
fashion, much ingenuity and idividuality are reported in
the selection or adaptation of the new mode to each
man’s taste. 0n the whole the college man seems to
come closer than his elders to having the courage of his
clutchesi'l‘he Christian Science Monitor.

Just The Work

It’s just the work of a Sec-
ond to take a picture. But
developing and priming are
not as simple. Care, experi-
ence and skilled judgment
are necessary to the photo
finishing laboratory if your
pictures are to be as good as
they should be.

You’ll make no mistake in
sending your exposed films-
to us.

 

Whether it be working or jousting,
for the next three months, let us sug-
gest that you make a final visit to
