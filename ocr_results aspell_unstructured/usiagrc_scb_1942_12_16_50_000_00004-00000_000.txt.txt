Seek Win Tonight
‘Over 'Panthers'

Grillneli‘s cage team travels to
Cedar Falls Wednesday to play
Iowa State Teachers in its first
game away from home. The Pion-
eers will be striving to get in
the win column after two
sti ight defeats at the hands of
Cornell and Drake. Last year
Grinncll split its two game 521'»
ies with the Teachers, winning
here but losing there.

The Panthers have a veteran
outfit, but have been losers in
their first three games of the
season. A strong South Dakota
State team beat them by ten
points, and Loras was victorious
by two points and ten points in
two games against the Teachers
this year.

Coach lLeSter Duke said yester-
day that he thought Crinnell had
a good chance of winning and
that the team would have no
height disadvantage as it did in
the Cornell game.

The probable starting line-ups
are as follows:
Gl'iunelli
F. Kaufmann
F. McCrane
C. Waters
G. Kennefick
G. Bowers

Prep Team Wins
Firs'l’ Game Wi'lh
Newton High 39-I9

The Crinnell prep basketball team
rode over Newton high school
Monday afternoon in their first
.appearance of the season.

After his team built up a 20-6
at the half, Coach Gene Peisner
used his reserves freely in the
second half. The Crinnell boys
came out on the long end of a
39-19 score as the final gun
sounded.

The preps, eager to vindicate
themselves for their failure to
turn out an eligible football team.
have produced a basketball team
of which they can be proud.

A1 Carlson and Walt Burns,
staiting for Grinnell, accounted
for a good share of the victory
with excellent rebounding and
close in shots. The other starters,
Jim Gibbs, Kermit Steinbeck, and
Dick Ryden did an excellent lob
of ballehdwking against the New-
ton team.

Fred Collins, reserve. played a
good share of the game, pouring
in a half dozen shots on beautir
fully executed fast breaks.

Against a stronger opponent,
the preps would have felt more
keenly the loss of Bill .Ecklund,
Clark freshman, who is out with
a foot injury, Ecklund has been
practicing with the preps all sea-
son and had clinched a spot on
the first team up to the time of
the injury, according to Peisner.

Last Minute
Grinnell Rally
Falls Short

Grinnell lost a hard-fought basket-
ball game to Drake Monday night.
3542, Crinnell was never in the
lead except in the opening, mo-
ments of the game when Kenne—
fick broke the icc With a free
throw, and Waters put Crinncil
into the lead with a field goal
after Drakes initial bucket.
Thereafter Drake was never head-
ed although Crinncll rallied to
within one point at the end of the
first half, and a late drive
brought Crinnell again within one
point with only two minutes to
play,

After Griunell's early flurry,
Drake took a commanding lead
of 10-3 after the first eight minu-‘
tes of play. At this point Vans-
truni went into the game and
scored a bucket to which waters
added another, leaving the score
10-7 in Drake's favor. After the
Bull Dogs ran their lead to 17»3,
Grinnell tied the score With nine
straight points, five of which were
contributed by Vanstrum, In the
last two seconds of the first half
Henley put Drake back into the
lead with a free throw.

Drake roared back at the begin-
ning of the second half with nine
straight points, making the score
27—17. The Pioneers were still not
out of the ball game, however.
They gradually narrowed the mar-
gin until two quick buckets by
Bowers left the score 31-30 in
Drake’s favor with two minutes
to go.

In the wild scramble which en-
sued, Scott drove in for a setup,
and Evans followed with another
basket to cinch the game for
Drake.
