commi‘uCATions,

The Scarlet and Black will we]—
come communications lrom all mem-
bers or the college body on any
subject which has general interest.
Faculty members and alumni are
particularly urged to take this op-
portunity of getting. their views he
tore the students,

The only requirements are that
the communications be limited in
length to ahout 250 words, and that
they hear the name or the writer
when they reach this office, The
name will usually be .withheld from
publication upon request.

constructive action is otten
'hrought about by intelligent crib
icisin. Grinnell students have a
wellsdevelopeil habit of “crahbing”
new, but this might be turned to
some good by discussion of the dis-
puted points in the communication
column.

THE TIME ‘To sultan

More college caiccrs are made,
and nioi~e.are’ ruined during the
first row wchs of the college year
than at any other time.

The impetus of a good start in
scholastic worlr, in athletics, and in
literary activities will last.
through a whole college year. A
poor start. on the other hand, in-
variably handicaps the man not only
in the particular piece or worlr

often, ‘

which he does poorly. hilt in all the
other work he is iiiiileitahing.

Most professors will admit that
the impression made by at new SUP
dent in his ﬁrst row nsiguiiients 01
work has an importance out ol all
proportion to the amount or work
done the ti , lew days.

Good work at first makes a Rule
ornhlc inipicssioii which temporary
fdilul‘? later will not remove, while
the impression of an initial (allure
can be removed later only by the
hardest kind of work.

Even more important. a man will
continue to do good work in nine
cases out of ten when he lins start-
ed out with the record oi‘ success.

Now. below the excitement of the
i'ooiball season has begun. is the
time to get that start. 2

it has hcconie an annual custom
ior ircshmen and uppetsclassmen toi
discuss freshmen caps at the open-‘
illg or the college year. Upper-class-l
men in general. lavoi- the adoption
of sonic distinctive headgear tor
the yehl‘iilgs. and the irosh them
selves would welcome some means
or distinguishing their members on
the campus.

A distinctive can would not he a
mark or ireshnian inferlol'ity. Ruth
it would he a mat]: oi fresh-
man unity. The rrcshinen would
more quickly hecoiric acquainted
with their own nicn. and the class
as a whole would have more or an
influence on the college life.

ironclad rules- imposed by upper--
classinen in regard to the caps are
not in accord with the community
spirit here. But there is no [ran
ditlon or attitude here which we:
discourage the new men themselves
troin adopting the can custom in
vogue in many college;

The rreshnien should give the
matter the consideration it deserves.
The class of 1922 will probably
