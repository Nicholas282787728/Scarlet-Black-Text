Runners Place In Drake Relays

The Grinnell track team tu-
rned in a respectable showa
ing at last week's Drake Re-
lays, with season's bests in
two relay events and fine ef-
forts by several men in the
marathon. The 440 relay unit
of Carl Brenne, Bill Swan,
Paul Lewis, and Jon Gray
couldn’t move the stick fast
enough as they finished well
out of the money, even though
they posted their best time
of the year. In the Iowa Coll-
ege mile relay, the teams of
Lewis, Bill Schooler, Fill Mo-
tales, and Swan placed a st-
'rong fourth. Their time of
3223.0 is the best in the con-
ference mis year, which isn't
bad for a relay team with no
sophomores.

Perfect marathon weather
and some measure of guts al-
lowed three of our men to fine
ish the 26 mile race through
the streets of Des Moines.

ninth place, an unofficial
school record. Eric Jahn and
Dave Cavander alsostaggered
home, but freshman ScottWeil
found he couldn't hack it and
hitched the last nine miles,
which goes to show that track
and basketball just don't mix.

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

April 30, 1971

Baseballers Drop Seven Straight

Grinnell's Baseball Nine was
bombed heavily since my last
column, getting outscored
107— 10 in its last seven out-
ings to lose all seven times.
The Pioneers lost a rain
shortened 8- 1 decision to Cor-
nell, booted both ends of a
double header at Coe by sc-
ores of 19-1 and 18-4 (both
games called after 4 innings
because of the 10-run Rule),
looked relatively respectable
in an 11-1 loss at Central
had a no»hitter thrown at th-
em at Knox in a 9-inning 24-
0 loss, and looked relatively
respectable at Monmouth in
losing two, 12-1 and 15-2.

Again Cornell, Grinnell‘s
shortsop/pitcher, Wes Fujil,
opened and closed) the scor-
ing for Grinnell as he led off
the firts inning with a home
run. However, a leakydefense
(a major problem this year)
soon spelled Grinnell’s doom,
and it was fortunate the rains
came early.

At Coe, it was, Unhappily,
a beautiful day. Poor defense
and worse hitting soon opened
the ﬂoodgates and starting
pitcher Fjuii was yanked af-
ter 2 innings in favor ofDeuce
Reliever Eric Hines. Keeping
up the tradition, he yielded
early, serving up a balk, a
walk, and a double to the fir-
st two hitters he faced. The
flood continued. In the second
game, the Pioneers setting
the tone, loaded the bases
with none out in the first inn-
ing and failed to score.

At Central, starting pitcher
Mike Levy, was robbed by

Tennis Team Clobbers Coe, 9-0

Last week the Grinnell ten<
nls team romped to a 9’0
victory over the Coe tennis
team. In the only close match
of the day, Brad Vazales at
#1 defeated Dick "Water-
melon Thief" Hoisington in
three sets.

Also winning singles for
the Pioneers were Ken Sch-
ofield, Jim Spell, Dave Bee-
man, Bruce Bonnewell, and
Glenn Cushing. Once again
Coach Pfitsch his customary
highlysstrategic tactics in en-
gineering the victory. These
consist ofluring the opposing
coach into .1116 depths of the
new P.E. complex for a per-
sonal 60Aminute 60 thousand‘
word guided tour, while out-

side the visiting team, with-
out the securing ofa coach’s
guiding hand, falls victim to
the bad bounces missed ov~
erheads, gusty winds and loss
of self-confidence that results
from losing to sucha motley
group of shaggymairedfreaks
(what did you think that was,
Glenn, a tennis' match or a
rock festival?)

The Pioneers, now 3»1 in
conference play, have nowun‘
fortunately, five consecutive
road matches. This weekend
they will play at Carleton and
St. Olaf and next weekend will
travel to Monmouth, Knox and
Beloit to conclude the dual
meet schedule.

the Grinnell defense (the way
the players play defense ret
minds one of a bullfight; the
player lets the ball get as
close as possible without ace
tually touching it), as 10 of
his ll. runs were unearned.

At Knox, the Pioneers tried
for 9 innings to scratch out
some kind of hit and failed.
The Siwash had no problems
hitting, however; the situa-
tion deteriorated so badly, it
is rumored that Little League
eat-Star JC Labowitz volunt-
eered to pitch.

If one thought Knox was a
hitter’s park, Monmouth was
what every hitter dreamsabr
out. It was impossible to play
fefense in the outfiletl; there
was almost as much grass
there as in the infield. There
were also, holes and dips and
rises out there. In spite of
it all, however, Grinnell pl-

ayed nearly flawless (for
them) defense against the st-
rongest hitting team in the
Southern Division. They were
still bombed.

Actually, in spite of the ap~
pearance that baseball is not
one of the GrinnEII Nine's
fortes, they have shown steady
improvement with each game.
There are innings in which
they look pretty good. Most
of the mistakes that are made
are due to numbers (there
are all of 12 players on the
team) and youth (approxim-
ately 8 of those 12 are preps
and sophomores). Thus as ex-
perience mounts (and it can
come only duringgames; there
aren’t enough bodies to havea
scrimmage), Play will im-
prove. This team will win a
couple of games before the
season ends.

GolITeam Wins
One, Drops Two

The Grinnell golfers defeat-
ed Monmouth 8‘7 but lost to
Knox 9-6 and to Central 11-4
Tuesday in a home meet. The
Nebraska Flash, Skip Tredway
was medalist with a two over
par 72. Other Grinnell scores
were Bill Chown 75, Todd
Wheeler, a newcomer to the
team, 85, Al Schoene 86, and
Gary Johnson 88.

The team's performancewas
definitely improved over the
first match of the year when
they were defeated by Knox
11 1/2-3 1/2 and lost to Mon~
mouth by 10 strokes. Theade
dition of Wheeler and senior
John Otto should be a con<
siderable asset to the team.

Our double-bogey award this
week goes to Coach Edd Bow-
ers for playing Otto only in
exhibition' where he shot a
nifty 73. If he had shot the
same in competition the Pio-
neers would probably have
beatne Knox also.

Monday the golfers travel to
Cedar Rapids to play four 0t—
her conference teams on the
course the conference meet
will be held. Tuesday they
play in the Hawkeye Invita-
tional, 36-hole event at Fink-
bine in Iowa City.

Set For May 8

tion is arranging the tourney
in cooperation with the Coun-
try Club and local citizens.

All golfers in the community
and at the collegcare eligible.
Participants will be divided
into foursomes, each of which
will have community and col-
lege golfers who will desig-
nate a local charitable organ‘
ization before teeing off. The
foursome with the best score
will turn the purse over to the
organization it has specified.

Names of the golfers in the
winning foursome will be in-
scribed on a trophy to be plan
ced permanently in the Coun-
try Club.

The college relations com~
mittee Will solicit local busi-
nesses for contributions to the
purse. The college has already
made a commitment to con-
tribute.

Persons interestedin signing
up for the tourney should get
in touch with Barry Zigas
