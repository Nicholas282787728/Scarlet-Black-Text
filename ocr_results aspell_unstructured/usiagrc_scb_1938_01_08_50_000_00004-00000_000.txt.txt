THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ALL VALLEY

The faculty will probably hear ‘

a recomendation from the faculty
committee on educational policies
on the new plan proposed to elmi-
hate examinations at their regular
meeting Monday, it was learned
today. 1

the stubstitution of unannounced
quizzes for the present examir
nations.

Members of the faculty com-
mittee are understood to favor,

and establish a. basis by which
grades will better represent the
student's actual knowledge of the

sustained over his eye will not
prevent him from playing.

The Pioneers will undoubtedly
tackle their toughest conference
foe of the season tonight. The
Aggies are undefeated in eight
games so far this year and are
favored to take the championship
for the second year in a row.
However, the Aggies themselves
feel that they do not have the all-
round strength they possessed last
year.

l

Ags Lose Veterans

Lost from that team are Cox,l
all—Valley forward; Ruusey, all—
valley guard: Captain Little,
1936 all—Valley guard; and two
other lettermen, McAleSter and
Stewart. ’

However, the Aggies have six
lcttermen returning, They in—
clude Krueger, Smelser, Barringer,
all—valley center; Kalsu, Scheffler
and Linn.

Lineup

It is likely that coach John
Truesdale will start the same line-
up which has been functioning so
far this year, including LaMasney
and conwill forwards, Berry and
Dean at guards, and Luick at
center,

Lulck‘s play, especially in the
Washington tilt, has returned to
a more normal plane, and he
should aid the Pioneers greatly.
In addition, the improvement in
play of John Turner, reserve
guar , has strengthened the Pie»
neer cause.

Not very much is known about
Tulsa as yet. They will play the
role of dark horse, although some
are saying that this year they
may have a better outfit than
Oklahoma. The Hurricane would
have finished a good deal better
in the conference race last year
if they hadn’t had a lot of hard
luck, but they'll be a good outfit
to watch carefully this year.

CAGERS TAKE TWO
CONFERENCE VICTORIES

Grinnell's pioneers came out on
top in their first two bids for a
conference championship this
week, when the scarlet»clad cagers
defeated Washington university
and St. Louis university on suc-
cessive night Monday and Tues-
day.

The Pioneers had little trouble
subduing the Washington boys on
Monday by a 41734 score. Wilbur
