They ‘doth protest too much, methinks’

So you don’t like weapon arsenals? You

don't agree with the philosophy that says 3

the United States needs weapons to defend
its ideology? You don't like the {act that
weapons are being made that kill ”mn04
cent people.” By god you. won't stand tor
ill ’

So you go chain youseli toa wrecked car.
You try and block other people irom doing
their jobs. You cause policemen to stop
protecting the citizenry who pay them so
that you can satisiy your egocentric urge
[or publicity. Most important you give
other people who may have icit support tor
your cause a good reason to ram symr
pathizing with you because they are angry
that you have hindered their ability to
work or because you have taken their
police iorce away ii-om them.

Perhaps you are ignorant or the damage
you are inilicting upon yourseli. your
cause and others. This ignorance is no 630
cus . but at leasl it explains your actions.
muLh like I can explain the action of a
threc~yearrnld child as he drin -s a quart oi
gasoline. or throws his molhcr's best China
against a brick wall.

Stupid. but then three-ycar-olds are supr
posed to be stupid.

or course. you might be acting so
lbolishly out ol maliciousness That Is. you
might support no cause other than your
own vendetta against society, Thus your
attack is quitc.successlul. and you should
be pleased. You have alienated a large
group or people. those who support the
arsenal and those who genuinely dislike it

Another consideration is that you are
cognizant of the tact that you anger people
and that you are aware that you divert the
actions or the police iorcc, irom their pro-

accomplishments. In that case you are not
only stupid and thoughtless. but you are
also participating in the same behavior

you claim lo protest,

You say that arsenals are producing
wcapons which allow nations such as the
United States to cocrcc other nations into
believing dcm -iatic and/or capitalistic
ideologies. You rc right. that's exactly
iiliai they do However when you don't
allow workers at the in anal to go to work.

you don't care. You would rather gratify

Has it occurred to you that the workers
are merely trying to make a living and it is

Poetry:

Invisible
empire

This is a tribulC to an endless empire that
no»onc ever saw. .

1 write about the dinosaurs

That lie behind unopened doors

or another world with a onerway road
Where the cagles learned to soar.

See. that was the year we wanted to ily
And the walls caved in on paradise.
what went wrong. I just don't know
Still by damn. we had to try.

We played the game and took the loss
And neyer dared to wonder why

It hurt so had to lose it all:

That was back in lightrlive

Somethings are just gone l’oreier.
They said they‘d never tor-get us
No no did it llkC we could
They said we would break the rules.
As the pillars oi Rome crumbled
Elidlcssly into an open sky
As the setting sun watched
nameless people sag goodbye.
Neronc really understood
llow suc s is really ci-ucl.
No-Dne ever stood so tall
i\n(l uren though we were no tools
Nnront- sail the rise and lull.
