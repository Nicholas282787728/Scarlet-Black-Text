Coal Solution IS In
GovernmentiStrong

That the present coal deadlock in
thc bituminous fields is rapidly bee
coming worse and its ultimate solllr
tion probably lies in some sort of gov-
ernment control, was the substance ot
a talk by Pi-oiessor Earl D, Strong
before C, G Eubnnk's economics class
Monday morning,

Professor Strung outlined the gene
eral coal situation, and after making
a distinction between the anthracite
and the bituminous group, he proceed-
ed with the causes for the present
crisis "There is an over production
in the coal fields or this country (0'
“There are too many
miners and this consequently brings
cut-throat competition. Profits are ex-
tremely low Many miners are out of
work toda Hence the labor diificult-
ies.

"Then there is the struggle between
the union and the non-union miners.
in which the union miners are losing
out. The present strike in tiie bitum-

’lhous fields is continually becoming

more serialls and nothing is being

Inasmuch as the min-
rive at a suitable remedy, the situa-
tion is likely to culminate in governs

lneht operation."

Numinatiorls for the Men's Court

,and Senate will take place at 7 o'clock

tonight in the A. R. H, auditorium.

No date has been set for the final
elections but they will probably be held
three or four days after the nomina-
tions, in the reading room of A. R. H.
voting will be conducted by written
ballot.

as in Grinnell at many schools, re-
ports of the third biennial canventiou

Mary Williamson, president of the Wo-
mens' League here and Sarah Boudi-
not, prosldencelect, who returned

at champalgn, llllnois.

In larger schools, the delegates re~
port, the r. w. c. A., W. A. A, and
the Women’s League have dlificulty in
harmonizing their activities so that
they will not infringe upon each oth-
er Only six schools at the conference
(Grinnell included) admitted them—
selves free of sarcalled “politics."

There were fifty-seven schools reps
resented at the convention. Colleges in
Arkansas, Kentucky, California, Mori-
tana, Arizona, Pennsylvania and New
York are members of the association.
Four colleges from Ioua, Cue, Cornell,
Gl'innell aha lowa state, were repre—
Seutcd.
