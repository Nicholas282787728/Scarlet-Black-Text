Taxi Driver: Scorcese’s
explosive gem

by Brian Strause

Taxi Driver will go down in
history as the ftlm that inspired
John Hinckley to shoot Ronald
Reagan. It's not hard to see how
Jodie Foster‘s rendering of a child
prostitute might touch a nerve,
especially in a taxi driver who
has been drawn by the dirt on the
streets, while simultaneously re-
pelled by it. Foster’s Iris cer-
tainly did the trick for Travis
Bickle (Robert DeNiro), who felt
compelled to ”save" her. By
killing Big Ron, Hinckley
apparently thought he could win
over Jodie, Not surprisingly,
Jodie wasn’t all too keen on her
one-sided pen-pul’s motives. She
was too wrapped up in classes at
Yale to have time for such Lrivir
alities.

Hinckley did not act alone in
his admiration for Foster’s per-
formance. The Academy nomi-
nated the lZVywr-old for best
supporting actress. Of course,
she did not win, but this over-
sight has been corrected, as Fosr
tcr's work in The Accused was
recently acknowledged with an
Oscar. Perhaps the Academy
feared retribution with the p0lcn~
Lial of l-linckley’s release.

Nonetheless, Taxi Driver will
also be remembered as Martin
Scorcese’s masterpiece, looking
into the soul and motives of a
maniac. DeNiro’s portrayal of
Travis Bickel is now rooted in
cinematic legend. Who can for-

get his chilling delivery of the
line, “You talking to me?“?
DeNiro's ﬂawless sense of emov
tion combined with Director
Martin Scorcese‘s slick manipu-
lation of the camera combine to
paint a porLrait of a killer unpar»
alled in film. Scorcesc gets to
the root of Travis‘ deviance titnc
and time again. Perhaps the
most telling scene occurs when
Travis asks Betsy (Cybill Shepr
herd) out for a date. They’ve al»
ready seen each other a few times
before with mixed results. The
first time goes smooth, but the
second time Travis makes the
mistake of of escorting her to a
porno ﬂick. Whereas in The
Graduate Hoffman utilizes this
maneuver to effectively repulse
his date, Travis acts merely out
of stupidity. Now Betsy doesn’t
want to have anything to do with
him, but Travis still stalks her
out. Upon asking for another
date, Travis is tumed down. The
camera can‘t even hear the impact
of this rejection as it moves away
from Travrs’ tortured face to the
asylum of a lonely hall.

In Taxi Driver, Director Mar-
tin Scorcese has shot an explo-
sive gem from his artistic can-
non. This film represents his
best work and will inevttably live
in the viewer's mind long after
the last frame ﬂickers on the
screen.

Au Fievoir Les Enfants Z

goodbye to c

You might at first be a little
confused, since what‘s listed as
Goodbye Children on the calendar
is actually Au Revoir Les Erl-
fcnts. It is director Louis Mallc‘s
(Candice Bcrgen‘s husband) film
about the most painful memory
of his childhood. Malle, who
grew up in Worldwiuat France,
tells here a fictionalized account
of his school-boy days in a
Catholic private school in the
country outside of Fountainbleau.

Malle's alter ego is 12-year»
old Julien Quentin (Gaspard
Manesse), a rich kid sent to study
with other rich kids at a some
what austere Catholic private
school, Three new kids enter the
school, one of them, Jean Bonnet
(Raphael Fejto), in Julien's class,

thhood

Jultcn suspects some mystery
behind them, and slowly discov-
ers that they are Jewish children
being hidden by the priests from
the Gestapo.

The rest of the film is the
story of the emerging friendship
between Julicn and Jean, and
moves towards the inevitable
moment we know must come, It
comes at the end, but Malle treats
it all with such understatement
that we do not feel at all ma-
nipualtcd. Malle said he was
afraid to make this film, for he
would have hated himself if it
hadn‘t turned out right. But it
did, .

A Great Wall answers

questions

by Nara Takakawa

Have you ever wondered what
it would be like for a Chinese-
Ameriean to return to China? A
Great Wall will answer all of
your questions

After being denied a promo
tion, Leo Fang quits his job in
protest and decides to return to
China with his family to visit
relatives. Upon their arrival in
China, Leo is struck by how
much the city has changed since
he left as a boy. The reunion
with his sister’s family is a
comical clash of cultures. Leo is
the only one who speaks ﬂuent
Chinese and neighbors mistake
these “foreigners" for Japanese or
Filipinos. Leo‘s brothcrvin-law
questions his American-born
nephew about the quality of his
Calvin Klein blazer because of
the patches on the elbows, not

realizing that the patches were
“fashionable” and not functional.

The Fangs return to San
Francisco with a new understand-
ing and appreciation for their
heritage. Though the film does
not directly deal with politics, it
provides an unusually intimate
look at contemporary post-Mao
youth, whose disinterest in poll»
tics is in itself a political state-
ment. Be aware that stereotypes
abound from an Asian‘s point of
View. The ﬁlm has been ac-
claimed as being “Lhe first Amer-
ican movie made in China." It is
103 minutes long and is in EnA
glish and Mandarin with English
subtitles, It will be shown in
South Lounge at 9 pm. on Sun-
day evening,

Stand by
Me: growing
up in the
19503

Rob Reiner‘s Stand by Me is
a male coming-of—age film nar-
rated by a middle»aged writer
(Richard Dreyfuss), The narrator
relates his memories about a
summer adventure in 1959, when
he and three of his friends set off
in search of the corpse ofa miss-
ing boy. It is a nostalgic and
lighthearted look at growing up
in the 1950s. if for nothing else,
go see this movie for the gross-
out effect of Barfro»rama. Star~
ring Corey Feldman, River
Phoenix, Jerry O’Connell, and
Wil Wheaten as the four young
boys, it is based upon Stephen
King’s autobiographical story
The Body.

Innerspace

by May-lee Chai

Innerspace is billed as a
comedy-fantasy, which is a neat
label for a messy story line.
Now listen carefully...

Dennis Quaid plays a macho
test pilot who is shmnk—along
with his “submersible pod”
vehicle—to the size of a blood
corpusele so that he can be
injected into 'a rabbit. But when
industrial spies try to sabotage
the experiment, he is injected
'instead into an unsuspecting
groceryrslore clerk, Martin Short,
for safe—keeping. While ﬂoating
around inside Short’s head, Quaid
must persuade Short to listen to
him, to search for a special
computer chip that will bring
him back to normal size, and to
do it quickly since Quaid will run
out of oxygen in no time ﬂat.

Actually, Innerspace is not as
bad as it sounds, The special
effects are top-notch, and if
you've ever wanted to see blood
streams, a beating human heart,
and other organs from the inside
out, this is the movie for you.

Short, of Saturday Night Live
fame, gives his funniest
performance to date as Lhe ﬂighty
clerk on the verge of a nervous
breakdown, Unfortunately,
Quaid, in this pro-Big Easy
outing. displays all the charisma
of a Neanderthal. Meg Ryan
(D.0.A., The Presidio), as
Quaid's “journalist" girlfriend,
is, well, perky.

Even if you don‘t have time
to see the whole movie, do try to
catch the last 20 minutes, as
endings this dtltrtb must be seen
to be believed.
