THE SELECTION oiProf. Graham
Taylor by the Chlistian Associar
tionsas speaker tor Day ot Prayer
certainly meets with the approval
of the student body The meet-
ings which he will address air: all-
nounccd in another column, Many
of the older students have heard
him before and will certainly need
no urging to attend these meetr
ings, Prot. Taylor has given a
large part of his life to christian
work and is a man of such char-
acter and experience thalit will
certainly be an inspiration to any
one to hear and meet hitn. Let
every student make it a point to
attend both of these meetings.

WITH THE gymnasium facilities
which have recently been placed
within the reach at the students,
indoor athletic work, which was
impracticable undcrprcvious con~
ditions, is well within the range of
possibility. In all the other col-
leges ot any importance in the
state,basltetrball is reaching a high
degree of development, and it is
to be hoped that the interest than
itcstcd in the game in our own
gymnasium will result in a good
college team in another year, al-
though it is too late to hope for
one this year. Another tormot
indoor athletlcs which should be
mentioned is the Pentathlon can
test, which is participated in ycar-
ly by teams representing the Y.
M. C. A. organizations of cities
and collcgcs. The cvcnts which
make up the program of the con
test are calculated to show the all-
round development of an athlete

in indoor work. This year they
will consist of the running high
jump, the relay potato race and
three exercises each on the horir
zontal bar. parallel bars and horse.
Eight men will compose a loam
and all teams entered must. be
registered in the Athletic League
of North Ametica. The contest
will be held at Cedar Rapids on
the last Friday in March, the
30th. It is a matter of some
doubt as to whether Iowa College
could, on such short noticc,orgarr
ize a team which could compete
with the strong city Y. M. C. A.
teams, particularly in apparatus
work, but it'snch a thing is posSlr
ble, SCARLET nzx‘n BLACK would
llke to see it done, There
doubt that we have in our gymna-
sium sufﬁciently good material to
make an excellent showing with
practice, and it could do no hurt
to have at least a preliminary can»
test in order to see what prospects
of success there are. It would in
every way be worth while to have
a team at the Pentathlon, as the
ver best teamsin Iowa take part.
and if a victory could be won over
them itwould give Iowa College
a prestige in indoorathletics equal
to that which she enjoys in out»
door sports. We hope thattlrrs
matter may at least be considered
and a team sent-if possible.
