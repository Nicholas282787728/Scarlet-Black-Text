an end at all.

The American Collegiate Ema
ployment institute oi Los Angeles
has mailed posters advertising an
offer for the Collegiate Summer
Employment Guide, a listing oi
summer job opportunities ior
An advanced
paymentol live dollars is required.

Two years ago many students
responded to the offer and most did
not receive the guide; and the
payment, at that time iour dollars,
was not recovered. A few did
receive the guide but not early
enough ior it to be useiul

Tile college attempted to iollow
up on the organization but was
unable to make contact The Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce
reported no knowledge oi such a

Ccompani and no phone number

was listed ior an organization by
that name. Presently, there is a
number listed.

The college reported the matter
to the U.S. Postal lnspectors'
oriice which in lurii reported the
matter to the Postal inspector in
Charge. Los Angeles, Grinnell has
received no progress reports on the
investigalion ot' the organization.

The posters reappeared last year
and were removed. 'rh tear the
posters went up again. making the
same oiier but with a one dollar

increase, College relations director
William Deminoit and head of
Career Services Office John
Adams said they had no idea who
was putting up the posters. A short
time aiter Deminoii said he
thought all the posters had been
removed, collections were found in
Clark and Dibble Halls

Deminoii discourages respon-
ding to the oiier. He said perhaps
the organization has become
legitimate but he doubts it, “I think

this outtit is a phony,” he said,

Adams said the guide is a work oi

duplication of the list put out by the

“it isn't any more valuable than
the information you can get here at
the Career Services Office.”
Deminoti said he is not aware of
any students at Grinnell losing
payments this year, but added that
the problem did exist at Drake
University and lowa State
University. He also mentioned that
he did not know of any other
organizations that caused the same
