Emma MR. LATTIMORE

This evening, Owen Lattimorc presents his
first lecture of a series on the SinoAJdpan-
ese conflict and its international aspects.
Mri Lattimore‘s knowledge of the subject
is based upon personal experience, both liv—
ing and exploring, in Asia, and upon his
present work. Wesuspect that the inquiry
into this subject is not only his work, but
also his hobby. We welcome hiln as an
authority to our campus.

Any student who fails to attend this
series of lectures is deliberately turning his
back to an opportunity—an opportunity to
learn more about the most important fac-
tors in world affairs of the future. ,The
struggle in the East is not the death»tln‘oes
of a decadent civi zation. China, Japan and
Russia are not stagnant. The struggle in
the East is the indicator of a transition to
new and powerful nations.

It was true in the past that foreign raih
ways ill China hauled her goods, and that
foreign capital developed and manufacture
ed hel‘ raw materials, but that situation be-
gan to change at the time of the Boxer
Rebellion. Since then, there has been an ine
creasing- tendency for Chinese men to p1 -
dominate in their own modern economic de»
velopment.

The entire East is experiencing, not a re-

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

l
juvenation, but rapid maturation after a;
rebirth. Western technical and business
knowledge is being adopted. At the same
time, when compared with the East, Eu-
rope is faced the other way. Many people
foresee the destruction of her civilization,
or at least its decline.

Thus, even without discussing the influe
ence of dictators, the importance of the
Chinesewnr is evident. The East s ocquir»
ing new significance. For authoritative in—
formation, for suggestions about our policy,
and for prophecies of the future, we turn
to Owen Lattilnore, director of the Walter
IIines Page school of International Relations
at Johns Hopkins university.

We congratulate the history department
for bringing him to us, and, Mr, Lattimore,
we welcome you to our campus.

PASSING or NW

A Pope is like a king of England; he is
important not because he is a person but
because he is a symboli When he dies, {i
new symbol with a new name succeeds him,
but even iii the Church itself affairs go on
pretty much as before. The institution which
the man heads is so vast and so amorpl us
that no one mall can rule it, The Eli lsh
Empire is the same, a vast, clumsy, une
wieldy entity which might well be unbee
lievable were it not represented by and em-
bodied in one man, the king,

Kings and Popes were not alway thus
Louis of France could proudly coll himself
the State, Some of the heads of the Church,
like Gregory VII, were as powerful as a
modern dictator but now the Pope no long—
er wears even a proud name, like Alexane
der, He has become Pius; he is holy alld
nothing more, Accordingly, the death of the
Pope is no longer the gravest event that
can happen. Instead, it is an excuse for
pageantry and furnishes the occasion for
electing a new Pope and more pageantry. .

In a few days, from a certain chimney iii
Rome will arise a little wisp of whitel
smoke. The cardinals in solemn conclnve will
have chosen a Catholic male to be the new
head of the Church. In the years that thisl
man sits on the papal throne, perhaps some
of the gravest of world questions will be
decided, including the fate of the Catholics
in Spain and in Germany, including perhaps
even the fate of Christianity itself.

From time to time the new pontiff will
issue pronouncements on world events, de-
fining the position of the Church of which
he is the head. But unless he is vastly dif-
ferent from the other twentieth century
Popes, what he says will i ‘\'e little weight
in determining world affairs. He will re-
main a symbol, the human symbol of the
oldest institution ill the world, the Roman
Church; and the politeness and probable in»
difference with which his pronouncements
will be received will be symbolic of the
steadily diminishing part the Christian
church is coming to play in world affairs.

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor at the
SCARLET AND isLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowle

In the recent Grinnell job sure
vey, the most calls that were re-
corded were tor music teachers
in the public schools. It is very
evident that this field of teaolin
ing is an excellent field to get
into, especially for men. The
public schools are definitely inter-
ested in getting trained men to
direct hands and orchestras in ad-
tlition to vocal music. Grinnen is
prepared to offer adequate train-
ing in this field and we must
find the students who are inter-
ested in this type or work

There certainly is a place for
leadership in this iiehl, there is
also great possibility for advance»
ment, both financially and other-
wise. Students interested in rnu-
sic and teaching should think this
over seriously,

Another point to remember is
that public school instrumental
music has grown tremendously
the last few years, while the pro—
fessionnl side or music, such as
private teaching and professional
playing, has practically died out.»

With the growth ”or radio,
movies, and television, the oppore
tunities for professional work will,
no doubt. become even smaller.

It is very obvious to see that
the iutui-e of music students at
Grinnell’ is in the public schools,

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

During the semester just com»
pleted, the student Council vars
sity club committee has endeavor»
ed to sponsor dances which would
have an appeal to the entire stu-
dent body.

Naturally, it is our duty as
elected representatives to give the
student liody the best parties pos-
sible Within our limited means.
In doing our part, we have tried
to obtain bands which will he eii-
joyezl by the majority oi the
school. We have created a plan
oi working out a theme for enoh
party which would he appropri-
ate; we have used decorations to
the best advantage, and in short,
we have tried to create dances
vihlch are more than “the same
old thing." ,

If we are to be successful, we
need the support oi the campus
So iai, for the second somest
we have had moral support only.
We can say that the sophomore
class, the Young Men's Christian
association, the League Board omit
the Council or House Presidents
have agreed to sponsor varsity
parties in cooperation with our
chili; antl for this enthusiasm We
are grateful.

However, we want allrcampus
support. Our only basis of oper-
ation is on the sale of our season
varsity tickets. if you want bet-
ter parties, help to put them on
by using a varsity ticket.

If you have any suggestions to
improve the parties, give them
to us. We want your opinions and
criticisms.
