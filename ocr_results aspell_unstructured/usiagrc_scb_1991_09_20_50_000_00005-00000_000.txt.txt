GENDER ISSUES AT GRINNELL

 

rHo'ro SEAN SOLBERG

Men’s group discusses their

role in society,

By Gareth Fisher

The campus group Men’s Alli-
ance for Change held it’s first mect~
, ing this past Tuesday. Originally
started two years ago by Todd Brown
‘ and Eric Skinner. the group provides
a a forum for men on campus to get
together, talk about feminist ideas
and relate them to their own lives.
Michael Landsberg and Kevin
Schmidt now coordinate the Men’s
Alliance. The group has always had
a discussion fortnat, and does not
plan to change that for this year. al-
though the group is open to change if
the members so desire.
The idea behind the group is “men
talking about things that concern men
T in a safe place," Said Landsberg.
‘Traditionally, men are closed to-
wards discussions about feelings and
emotions." Landsberg hopes tltat the

SCXlSI’l’l

meetings will “provide an opportur
nity for us as men to clear up the
confusion we have about who we are
and what our role in society is."

In thepast,thegrouphasdiscussed
issues such as father/son relations,
homophobia, male friendships and
male guilt, which Landsberg defined
as the idea that males are seen as an
institution of patriarchy, and male
oppression

He explained that the group‘s
membership is open only to men,
because“menfeelsafertalkingarormd
[other] men" about issues and ideas
they have in common as men,

Landsberg said anew group affili-
ated with the national group “Men
Stopping Rape“ might be formed on
campus. This group would be more
political than theMen’s Alliance,and
would consider sponsoring a campus
workshop on the issue of rape.

Black women must fight
both racism and sexism

By India Weston

Seven Afro-American and Afri-
can women interviewed about the is-
sues of feminism and sexism, inclur
siveness of the feminist movement

7 and the comfortability they felt to-
wards women's groups on campus.
held strongest to the color of their
skin. They explained that their focus
was sprang not only from their pride
in being black,butfrom the constant
reminders of being black and their
need for support that arises from tltose
reminders.

Marie Myers, who graduated last
year, felt that as a black woman on a
campus like Grinnell, her spare time
should be spent as a member of Con-
cemcd Black Students (CBS), In this
way, she was able to be involved in
politics as well as be actively in-
volved in the black community.

The Black Women‘s Support
Group has materialized as the most
imponant group and most satisfac-
tory outlet for black women on carn-
pus, according to the women inter-
viewed. Because of the complexity
of her dual role, one black woman

» stated she would feel too homog-
enolIs being involved in the feminist

movement. Another student said she
did not want to bejust a woman, but
a black woman. This sentiment was
shared by the seven women inter»
viewed.

For these women, racial concerns
and black issues tend to take prece-
dence over women’s issues. They
believe that the issues for black and
white women are not the same, see a
racialhierarchyinthefeministmove»
ment. and prefer fighting as a black
person, lifting their entire race.

A few years ago, the Black
Women’s Support Group and the
Women’s Support Group met.
Pamela Waller, who attended this
meeting. observed that the Women's
Support Group tended to take a more
political and intellectual approach.
whereas the Black Women’s Support
Group tended to be more emotional
and intimate.

Waller explained that “women’s
groups won’t be realistic until
multiculturalism is realistically in»
elusive,” and that the problem goes
beyond the Grinnell College campus.

Employee survey Shows women less
satisﬁed with college policies than men

By Sarah Purcell

Last October, the Women’s Alli-
ance Committee, aided by the Office
of Evaluation and Planning, surveyed
501 cmployecsofGrinnell as apartof
the continuing effort ofthe Women‘s
Alliance to “identify and address
women'sconcemsandissuesoncam-
pus."

The questionnaire was tailored to
identify employees’ overall satisface
tion with everything from communi»
cation and consistency of college
policim to the effectiveness of afﬁr-
mative action and attitudes toward
salary and work conditions.

included in the survey were em-
ployees from every area of the col-
lege: administrators, support staff,
faculty, Dining Services workers, and
physical plant employees.

The survey results illustrate the
wide variety of opinion among Grinr
nell employees. Nevertheless, the
report does esmblish several differ-
ences in opinion which appear to be
shaped by gender.

The report concludes that, except
for issues of salary and health insur-
ance, “women are consistently less
satisfied across employment catego-
ries than their male counterparts
...Generally, women feel somewhat
more marginalized, less consulted,
and less well-informed than men, as
well as more fearful of making their
views heard. Women are pessimistic
about the college‘s commitment to
helping them rise professionally or
even affording them opportunities
equal to those offered men."

Dining Services women were the
“most satisfied” female group in-
cluded in the survey, while Physical
Plantwomen employees seemed least
happy, The report characterizes fe-
male faculty members as “a bit less
optimistic" than their male counter-
pans, “particularly about issues of
affirmative action."

Female administrators and sup
port staff were markedly less pleased
with their positions than were similar
men, often for reasons related to their
gender. The report states that “fe-
male administrators feel that their
gender is a detriment to promotion,”
The report atuibutes disaffecrion
among female support staff to the
comparatively clerical natureof their
jobs and the lack of opportunity for
advancementaffordedbythecollege.

Overall, the survey determined that
most employees perceive a problem
with morale at the college. and
“women are generally less satisﬁed
with morale than men in the same
employment category."

Several questions included in the
survey elicited markedlydifferentre-
sponses from women than from men.
While 90% of male administrators
agreed with the statement, “Sexual
harassment of employees at the col-
lege rarely occurs." only 63% of fe
male administrators agreed. While

76% of male faculty agreed with the
statement, 58% of female faculty did
likewise.

Only 5 l %ofthose surveyed agreed
that “hiring and promotion practices
are conducted fairly at Grinnell Col-
lege," and the women’s responses
were lower across the board. The
report concludes that, when judged
by employee perception. “fair hiring
and promotion practices appear to be
a problem for Grinnell College."

"l'hereportprovides recommenda—
tions for improvementsin theareas of
communication.employer-employee
relations, governance, professional
development. affirmative action, eq-

uity, and commitment to employees.
Manyof thesuggestions stress greater
ﬂexibility and an effort to provide
more equal treatment to all college
employees.

“An inclusive. fair, cooperative,
and humane attitude. enforced from
the top down and supponed by the
whole community, is the most basic
assumption behind our recommenda-
tions.“ states the writers of the report

“Most of the people at Grinnell
College agree that Grinnell is a good
place to be, yet there are many heart»
felt grievances. Good as the college
is. why should it not be better?" they
asked.

 

Grinnell's gender-issue groups
serve social. political purposes

Most gender groups on campus are not primarily political organi-
zations or support groups (although they can serve these functions
when the need arises). Instead. they are social groups which provide
a setting for members to interact with people of their own gender and
background in a comfortable environment. Many members of these
groups feel that limiting the group membership to a single sex creates
a more unrestricted aunosphere in which people can feel free to
interact in a unbiased social setting Gender groups on campus focus

on a number of different issues.

The Gay/Bi Men's Social Group came about because of the
interestofgay or bisexual men to ”...have our own ‘gay space,‘ where
we are able to talk and act freely,” as contact person Andy Coghill
described it. The group meets periodically depending on the interests
of the members to watch movies, have a potluck or just hang out

The Lesbian/Bi Women‘s Social Group was created simply to ﬁll
the need [or a social space for lesbian or bisexual women. The group
sets the foundation for political action by establishing a community for
these women, but on the whole it remains a social group. Heather
Terrence, a member of the group for the past several years, described
the group as, “a chance for the lesbians and bisexual women to interact
in apositive, comfortable social atmosphere." Their activities include

videos and roller skating.

The Black Men‘s Support Group provides an opponunity for
black men to share concerns and experiences with individuals of
similar backgrounds. Meetings are primarily in a relaxed social
environment and allow people to comfonably join in discussion.
Brian Smith and Aras Vasaitis describe the group as addressing a
specific need in the Grinnell community; "Often black men share a
common experience thatpertains to their being black, male. and of a
culture different from the culutre of the majority on campus."

The Politically Active Feminist Alliance (PAPA) is probably the
most political gender group on campus. The group, which is open to
men and women, is a Grinnell-based organization, but often extends
its perspective by working for change with othercolleges and national
organizations. Joan Johnson, an active member of the group, de-
scribed PAFA as, “a feminist group committed to political action and
the end of the pauiarchal society." This year one of the major issues
being considered is multiculturalism.
