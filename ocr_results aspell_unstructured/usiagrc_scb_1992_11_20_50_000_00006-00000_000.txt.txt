A slight downturn ended a
roller-coasterrride season for the
men‘s cross counuy team. The
Pioneers closed their season last
Saturday by placing fifth at the
NCAA Division 111 Central Region
Championships held at Grinnell.

The 1992 campaign was an up-
and-down affair for Grinnell start
ing with the loss of a classmate at
the beginning of the season. The
barriers were able to settle into a
regular routine, however. and win
theirseventh-straightMidwestCon—
ference title.

Because Grinnell was a poten-
tial national meet qualifier and
defending region champion, last
weekend’s ﬁnish was not what the
squad hoped for. St. Thomas won
the meet with 71 points while
Carleton and St. John’s tied for sec-
ond widi 86. Those teams advance
to the national meet.

Gustavus Adolphus accumur
lated 120 points for fourth placed
while Grinnell had 169.

Coach Will Freeman analyzed
his squad’s performance: “We were
well tapered and healthy entering
the meet, but we just didn’t run
well. Our runners ran as hard as
they could. Why we were off, I
don'tknow. I feel especially disap-
pointed that our two seniors, Jeff
Ulmer and Byron Johnson, will not
have a chance to run at the national
meet.”

Ulmer won praise from Free-
man for his 19thrplace finish in a
time of 26:40. He was just four
people out of individually qualify-
ing for the national meet. Chris
Mills concluded an outstanding
sophomoreseasonbyfinishing22nd
in 26:44.

The next pack of Grinnell rune
nersincluded MarkBeilstein in 38th
place and Mike Nawrocki in 39th.

plete the team scoring. Byron John,
son and Jim Mills, who were
Grinnell‘s other runners, finished
84m and 112m.

Freeman is optimistic about
1993 because the Pioneers return
four of their top ﬁve scorers and
five oftheirtopseven runners. “We
should be stron; again next season.

we did not finish better,” said Freer

Wartburg won the meet with
64 points while St. Thomas beatSt.
Olaf, 59,129, for second place. All
three teams will advance to the na-
tional meet hosted by Union Col-
lege this Saturday.

Grinnell placed 12th with 335
points. The Pioneer‘s standing was
one better man last year.

While Freeman wanted herrun-
ners to produce their top perfor-
mances of the season, she did not
expect the top times of the year
becauseSaturday'scoursewashilly

fer Jacobson and Holly Pfttsch,
turned in personal records.
Stephanie Hitztaler, Kara Beach and
Jessica Henry all turned their top
times run on the hilly course.

Hrtztaler completed an out-
standing rookie season by placing
27th in a time of 19:23. Her class-
mate, Ally Beckman, finished 55th
in 19:43. Coach Freeman com—
merited. “These two runners were
our strength all year and the rest of
our team provided depth.”

Henry and Beach were the next
pack of runners, finishing 77th and
85th in times of 20:26 and 20:35.
Jacobsen and Pfitsch placed 92nd
and 93rd in times of 20:40.2 and
20:40.5. Mercedes Mearcompleted
the course in 21 :30 which was good
for 114th place.

“This was the strongest team I
have had here at Grinnell,” com-
mented Coach Freeman. She con-
tinued, “We are nine deep and only
lose Mear, Beach and Teri
Derrickson to graduation. The fur
turc looks very bright for us."

“1 am cautiouslyoptitnistic about
this season," stated swimming conch
Ray Obcrmtllcr when asked to do
scribe the men’s team’s chances of
winning its fifth consecutive Mid-
westConferencechampionship. The
Pioneers Will try to compensate for
the loss offlve Seniors, including ally
Americans Dave Rcssner and Joe

sibly the best ln our history."

On Friday night the team faces
Washington University of St. Louis
and North East Missouri in a non
conference triangular. On Saturday
the Pioneers host the Gleysteen Re-
lays which features Mankato State
and conference foes Coe and Cornell
in addition to Washington U. and
N.E. Missouri.

Obcn'nillerbelicves that the'Pio-
necrs will be at a slight disadvantage
this weekend because of inadequate
practice Lime. The three non»league
schoolshavebeen practicing forscv;
cml months, while conference regur

lations dictate that practice may not
begin until the last week in Octobcr.
However, Obermillcr still believes
that Grinncll will be able to hold its
own.

with JP. Ficning, will serve as tri-

concerned, things look pretty good.”

Tip-off Tournament is
this weekend

by Alex Severens

This Friday night presents the
first challenge to the young men's
basketball team when founhryear
coach David Arseneault welcomes
three teams to Darby Gymnasium for
the Tip-Off Tournament. At 2:00
Friday afternoon Buena Vista will
play Mt. St. Clare and the Pioneers
will meet Maryvilie of St. Louis at
5:30. DeLong Sportswear Inc. and
10K Sports Drink are co-sponsors of
the tournament. DeLong has been
involved for five ytmrs, 10K is a new
sponsor this season.

Arseneault is eagerly anticipat-
ing the start of this season, and hopes
it will be the watershed year he is
looking for. “Last year we reached

our goal of ending the frustrating los-
ing string and this year our goal is to
start the winning string.“ Grinnell's
11-11 record last year was the best
record posted by the team in many
years. With an exceptionally strong
junior class leading the way,
Arseneault hopes thepieces will hein
place this season to compete with the
top of the Midwest Conference.
One of the Pioneers toughest
challenges this season,willbeadjust-
ing to the loss all-conference player
Chris Jacobsen. Hopes rest largely
with four juniors whose experience
playing together for thepast two years
makes them fiercely competitive.
Todd Young and Jason Franci are the
corcaptains and the leaders. both on
and off the court. Todd’s 111 assists

and arejoined by Mankato State, CDC
and Cornell.

The meets will be a true baptism
as 15 squttd members have had no
previous competitive experience.
Their addition makes the45-member
squad the largest in Grinnell history.
or those, only 13 are returning
letterwinners so the group has lost
about half of last year‘s Midwest
Conference crew. Returning confer-
encechampionstncluchanaDanley,

Swenson. The team will be 1ch by
senior captains Danley, Holly Keliar
and Mercedes Mear.

Due to the youth of the squad,
Obermillerprcdictsthatthisyearwill
be a “building season." This week
end will be a challenge, as the Pi
nccrswill be facing Lhreeofthe tough-
est teams of the season. Both Mankato
State and NE. Missouri are NCAA
Division 11 schools, and have been
practicing for 10 weeks as compared
tothethrcewecksthatGrinncllswim-
mers have spent in the pool.

last season proved his unselfish atLt-
tude and hrs “team mentality." Jason
pulled down 110rebounds whilc cone
Lributing four points per game.

Craig Studer and Chad Folsom
are two other jtlniors who will play
large roles. Craig scored 11.2 points
per game last season and shot 42.6%
from threerpoint range. Chad pro—
vided excellent versatility and col-
lected 75 rebounds.

Last season ’5 freshman class pro-
vided an allrconference selection.
Steve Diekmann scored 16.7 points
per game and his 52% threcrpoint
shooting destroyed the old school
record. Todd McGuire is another
sophomore letterlnan who will again
be vying for astarting position.

Starting a winning tradition de-
pends largely on recruiting.
Arseneaultcould not be happier with
this year‘s group of first-year stu-
dents. He says, “Without question
thc best recruiting year we have had
in 10 years. We will be counting on
them heavily.”
