Do you feel that it is possible,
to include the Cyclone in the}
present fee?

nelen Baumgartner, lvlain
lrcshman: Yes, i do. I think it
would bonelit the students, be
cause the price might be lower
ii everybody bought it.

included in the sem fee, then
I belleve it would be possible.

Judie Reset, Main ireshmn
Yes, 1 think it would be a veryl
good idea because its much
at one
for it at times when people
don’t have. Most people buy
the Cyclone anyway, and it,
might bring the price down if
more would buy it.

Ed Laing. Cowlcs sophoinoi~e:‘
Yes, Letters irom comparable
college's year-book staris lndk
cate that they all have sliiiilar‘
setups and can’t understand how
we can put out a book at all
under our system. The Cyclone,
which is something most stu-
dents want and use, certainly
deserves as much support as it
can be given.

Carl ltiinge, Cowles sopho-
more: I imagine that the five
dollars for the yearbook could
be included in the semester fee;
but if the book is worthy it
will sell itself and shouldn't res
quil'e coercive means to boost
sales.

Jerry Tomlinson, Cowles soph—
omore: Probably so, if it
doesn't increase the sem fee and
it does result in a better year
book.

The above question was sub-
mitted by Barry Lawrence, Clark
junior. and was judged best by
Lucy Tye, S&B editor and Norm
Cohen, Chesterfield representa.
tive on campus. For submitting
the best question, Lawrence will
receive loo free Chesterfield
