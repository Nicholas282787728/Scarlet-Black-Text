Mildew, lb‘elblmlldiitw 16., 1996
I ve been thinking...

cally, I don't pretend lo take myself
too seriously (so don't treat this let-
teras a Kick Me’ sign) but I'd like to
take issue with some of the images
and suggestions raised

At the talk Monday night there
was: pyramid analogy set forth which
put “White" stutlents on the top.
Perhaps lhe “White" students have
the freedom lo ignore race, but I
oppose the image because it suggests
that people whose cultural experi»
ences are “lower down" on the pym»
mid are somehow living an interior
cultural exrstence I'm suggesting
that there needstobc more eiiortput
iorth to separate the concepts oimi—
notity/matority and superiority/infe-
riority. I oppose the suggestion that
selfrimposed emotional flogging
(such as, “YES I AM A RACISTI I
AM BAD!) isone stepcloserto iden«
tification with persons ofcolor, as if
ieclings of inadequacy move some-
one one step closer to understanding
the cultural experience of those who
are placed lower on the pyramid. 1
don‘t think Mr Put was suggesting
that his family necessarily feels dc.
prtved with their twocars, laigc lawn,
house in need of a paint Job, and
cocker spaniel even though based on
the pyramid model he, too, should be
placed lou'ertlown M|n0n[y/maj0r>
ity isa numerical concept. liyou put
yourselion top of the pyramid, stop
ranking the different tiers.

.,.that lately i have a low toler—
ancefortelevisionadvertising What
bugs me most about commercials is
their portrayal oi liic's minor incon.
veniences as motor causes for alarm.
Let'sfaceit,leakytliapers,staticcling,

theadvertisers'bestefforttoselltheir
products. However, there are some
commercials that lruly bother me
because a trivial condition or actual
slate of being is depicted as abnor—
mal. cast- in point, are ads for weight
loss programs

First, I have a confession: I’m
fat. Yes, I said FAT. For me, the term
“overweight” begs the question

they would make me thin, and 1

The bitterness reflected by thatstate»
ment is the result ofa personal tever
Iation I came to last year: being fat
isn't bad. Foriweniy years i believed
every he told to me about tat, but
now that I recognize the deception
being perpetrated against myselfand
millions of others, I'm not staying
quiet.

IfI believed what many of these
ads imply 1 would have to agree that
fat people lack self confidence, and
are not as energetic, attractive. or
employable as thinner people. The
common assumption is clear: being
fat is a terrible thing and one must
lose weight to become a better per-
son, Two words: Ileﬁillesl Truth—

blc oidoing any job, and I think I’m
pretty cute too. My weight is part of
who I am, and losing it would not
create a new and improved me.

i believe there is a diiiercncc
betweensimplyscllmgaptoductthat,
admittedly, may help some people
who want to lost weight, and cruel
manipulation of the widespread (ear
of fat in America, especially among
women. One lc client tells us to
.fnce it, i was int!" and supports
her claim with the fact that she wote
a size 16 berate she touted. Folks, I
haven’t been a size lo in years. Lite
goes on. What does this say to a
woman who wears size 16, or larger,
but doesn’t consider herself (at, or
(heaven forbid) is happy with her
site? That she’s tn denial and her
satisiaction with her body image is
unioundedi By exploiting a widely
held insecurity, lennyctaiggets richr
er while 1, and many other in [RP
sons, get insulted.

As long as the ridiculous idea
that fat denotes inferiority goes un—
challenged I wouldn't expect a de.
cling in the incidence of eating dis
orders anytime soon. Additionally.
scores oiiat petsons willgo on living
in an atmosphere of animosity, de<
med basic respect because, in the
eyes of many. we are not perfect.
Regardless of what anyone personal—
ly believes about heaIth and weight.
it is plain to me that such mistreat.
ment is wrong. It took me years of
unproductive self— loathing to under—
stand that. So it you see me on
campus, barking at the TV, humor
me. I'miust tellingJenny Craig and

Window Locked
From Outside

BY DAN BUE’J’J‘NER

As my 15th year of competitive
swimming draws to a close this week,
I've been thinking quite a bit about
the nature ofthe sport, about why the
pool keeps calling me back, and, more
generally, about the fun times I’ve

had.

Whenl first began swimming, at
age six, a workout comisted of a lot of
stretching, and a few pushups and
su—upsiﬂnd perhaps 300 yards of ac.
tual swimming. Races in the stxand.
under age group were half a length
long, accomplished by being carried
out to the middle of the pool by an
oldersnimmcr and thengivenahuge
push toward the wall. Nowadays, a
workout is anywhere between 5,000
and 7,000 yards—sometimes twice a
dayeand my longest race is 1,650
yards instead ortwelve and onehali

When i was eight, I distinctly

age group record in the Z5<yard free
style with a biasing time of 18.88

record in the 50-meterftee these days.
That was to be my iirst and only
record,though,andtheyearsbetwcen
that record and high school are filled
with one third place after another.

High school swimming can best
be described as a living hell. The
teams are so large, and the coaches for
the most part so disinterested, that
they don’t have time to give individ.
ual attention to anyone but the top
few swimmers—consequently, most
of us swam numbingly long work
outsisome as long as 10,000 yards, at
little less than six miles, at once—
wtth little or no encouragement every
day for our inst year or two.

, The hard work paid off, though.
with a trip to the lowa high school
state championships my jumor yeari
My team qualified two relays for that
meet, and we periormed incredibly
well. Our 200 medley relay moved up
hom Zan place to eighth, and our
200 free relay moved up from 10th to
ninth I didn’t think I would ever
have a more intense cxpenence than
watching H), the anchor on the
medley relay, rocket into the wall a

time. But thenI had an assignment to
photograph the team in action for the
paper, and going to that meet brought
it all back for me As usual, the team
lost miserably, but I missed it all so
much. I quit my job, told my fellow

Then i came to Grinnell and
took part in two incredible underdog
seasonitnale victories as one of the
Mad Dogs, My ﬁrst year, we were
picked to lose the Conference cham—
pionship to Lake Forest. We knew we
could win that meet, though—0ﬁ2n
it is not the team with the best swim»
men, but the team with the most
heart. that triumphs in the end. We
watched as Lake Forest won nearly
every eventiand then we watched
our teammates come in close behind
in, say, third, fourth, sixth and eighth
places. it was damn close, and we
only won by 19 point54consideting

Last year, having lost our star
distance swimmer, we were picked
not ,ust to lose, but to iinish an igno.
minious third to Lake Forest and
Lawrence But the meetwas at home,
in our own pool, and we knew that we
had been underestimated. once again
we watched Lake Forest place one or
two swimmers near the top in every
event, and once again we swarmed in
behind to outscore them in nearly
every event.

In retrospect, I am truly happy
that we won that year, not only be.

He had been coaching the men’s swim-
ming team for some 30 years at that
point, and I’m glad we were able to
make the last meetof his career agood

I am also glad we won both years
because that kind ofvictory means a
lot to me. I’ve never been a star
swimmer, and sometimes it is incred<
ibly nustrating to watch others glide
effortlessly to times I know i’ll never
achieve. But with the Mad Dogs, our
victories were team victories. Lake
Forest may have had the stars, but
that was all they had Either their
coach wasn't interested in keeping
the average swimmers around, or,
worse, the stars were too full oithem.
