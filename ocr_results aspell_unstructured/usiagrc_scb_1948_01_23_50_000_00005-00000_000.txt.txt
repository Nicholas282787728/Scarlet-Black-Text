mittee on student Organizations,
is a sad alternative. Although stur l
dents can now drop and pick up
their cleaning on campus, the new
student cleaning service deals on—
ly with the three town cleaners.
It is significant that, a week be
fore the plan was announced, the
town cleaners boosted their prices
25%.

Meanwhile the Waterloo coin-

cleaning a dress or suit and ice
for a pair of pants, while students
living on campus must pay $1.25
and 65c, respectively, for the same
service. The Waterloo truck is in
Crinnell four days a week but,
under present college regulations,
cannot stop on the campus.

To pay 67% more than neces-
sary for cleaning is an uneconomi-l
cal and unrealistic method of fos-
tering good feeling between cola
lege and town, especially since the J
entire cost of such “public rcla-,
tions” fails on the students. We
urge authorization of a student
cleaning agency which can deal
with Waterloo and charge accord-
ingly. It seems unfortunately
clear that only through competir
tion will Crinnell cleaning prices
become more reasonable,
