Fatal fall semester of 1991

By Gareth Fisher

It has been mentioned on more
than one occasion that last semester
was“harder” than most, forindividu-
als and for the campus as a whole.
ManyGrinnelliansexpei-iencedstress,
frustration,and general difﬁculty just
getting through the semester. This
observation immediately led to
curiousity as to whether this was a
true phenomenon experienced by
most of the campus community and,
if so, why?

This was exactly the questionasked
of a random selection of professors
and studentson an e-mail survey. Out
of the professors who responded, only
about half felt the semester was more
difficultthan most. However, 11 out
of 14 of the students who responded
felt it was probably their most difﬁ-
cult semester.

As for an increase in academic
difﬁculty, very few accepted the idea
that the academic workload for the
campus as a whole increased dra-
matically last semester, although
many felt it increased for them per-
sonally. Most students attributed this
increase in workload to taking higher,
level courses as they progressed fur»
ther in their Grinnell education, with
each semester more challenging than
the one before.

However, this does not explain
why students would notice it more
last semester than any other. As one
student suggested, there was most
likely acombination of factors which
made last semester seem more difﬁr
cult than most.

Many respondents spoke of fee
tors outside the school which reflected
the campus mood, A variety ot’exter—
nal economic, political and environ-
mental events last fall were extremely
frustrating: these events included the
recession, the aftermath of the Gulf
War. the Thomas-Hill hearings, and
even the lousy weather. indeed, many

felt this fmstration was not restricted
to Grinnell, but was also prevalent on
other college campuses for the same
reasons.

Other negative factors suggested
were campus concerns such as as-
saults, swastikas, dorm overcrowd-
ing, and a comparable lack of social
events in relation to other semesters.
Many respondents felt this frustrar
tion was compounded because, in the
words of sophomore Nyasha Spears,
"there was no channel for political
anger and frustration." Some stu»
dents also felt there was little to help
alleviate this frustration because Stu-
dent Affairs was unaware of student
needs and concerns,

Other factors included longrtcmt
trends thatmay have come to a head
last semester, One of these factors
was a long-term trend of better and
better students being admitted to the
college. John Hopkins, director of
admissions, felt this would increase
student workload: “If you increase
your student quality, students are go-
ing to want to give more and faculty
will rise to the challenge." Students
who are more serious about acadcmr
ics may also be more likely to experi»
ence stress. However, Hopkins was
quick to point out that the differences
in the academic quality of the four
current classes are “statistically in-
significant”.

John Mohan, professor of Rus-
sian, believed that ”symptomatic of
the problem is the hasty tempo of
Grinnell life." He observed that stur
dents nowadays have less time for
purely social activities or “leisurely
reflection," two things he feels are a
vital part of a well rounded college
experience. However, he stated that
hedid not justbegintonotice this last
semester.

Other people offered the explana
tion that the feeling that the semester
was “hard" hada way of perpetuating
imelf. Victoria Brown, assistant pro-

fessor of history, called this phenom-
enon a “stress virus". She said:
“People talk about stress enough and
others wrll startto namcand interpret
theirexperiencesin those terms." Slu-
dents agreed. One student fclt thathis
difficulties were compounded by 566*
ing his friends around him “falling
like flies." Several respondents also
suggested that the problem seemed
worse than it actually was because
constant discussion blew things out
of proportion.

Some were of the opinion, how-
ever,thata"hard”scmesteracadcmi-
cally (though not socially and politi-
cally) is not a bad thing at all. Some
students suggested that they enjoyed
the semester because it was more
challenging. As James Kissane, pror
fessorofEnglish putit: “Difficulty—
somc kinds, anywayi is the name of
the game when it comes to education,
or indeed any game worth playing."
Hopkins also remarked that students
would be the first to complain if they
were not seriously challenged.

Last semester indeed a hard sca
mcster’! And, if so, in what ways?
How can this be improved this so-
mester? Catherine Sheskcy, a resi-
dent advisor and academic counselor
at Student Affairs, believed that a
clean start was needed and hoped that
events like the W.R.A,P.s (Wednes»
day RA. Programs) would add a so
cial and political outlet thatmay have
been sorely missed last semester.

The results of the survey were not
completely conclusive. The survey
did suffer from a huge nonrrcsponse
bins, meaning that respondents choA
sen tended to feel strongly about the
issue. Perhaps, a silent majority found
the semestereasy,orwereinsensitive
to any change. For those for whom
the semester was difficult, however
many or few, I hope this discussion
has made the issue clearer, andl hope
this semester will be an improvement
for everyone.

Scholar talks on women's literature

By Alison Wade

Earl Fitz, noted scholar of Ponu-
guese and Comparative Literature,
illustrated the interaction of Latin
Americanpolitics, gender, and litera-
ture last night at 8 pm. in the South
Lounge of the Forum.

In his lecture, entitled “Political
Literature and the Rise of Women
Writers in Brazil and Spanish
America: AGrand Tradition Revital-
ized," Fitz examined the remarkable
surge of top quality Latin American
women writers, According to Fitz,

Fitz, a professor at Penn State

socio-political and culturalcontext in
which Brazilian and Spanish Ameri

Grace addresses
black leadership

By Papa Owusu

Dr. Cynthia Grace explains the
dilemma facing Blacks in leadership.

Speaking on the topic “the Di-
lemma l-actn g African-Americans in
Leadersip," in South Lounge last
Tuesday, Dr. Cynthia Grace observed
that many Blacks in leadership posi—
tions get there ata “pathological cost."
She explained that this was largely
because many of the unfoundered
negative perceptions about Blacks
remain in place.

Dr. Grace made itclear mat “his-
torical pattems that are familiar, are
used to exclude African-Americans
from positions of leadership in the
contextof the wor kplace." She added
thatthis is often supported by “clabo-
rate ideological claims and rationale
that Blacks only get there to keep the
status quo.” Shc regretted that al-
though Blacks have historically pro-
duced outstanding leaders, it is a fact
often overlooked. Grace recalled great
names like Bethune Cookman,
Malcom X and Dr. King its cvtdcncc
of outstanding Black leadership.

She also pointed out that racial
stereotypes result in “greater occupa
tional restriction for Blacks." Shc in-

ferred that this was the reason most
African—Americans were confined to 7
service and operative jobs that tend to
be lower paying and command lower
status.

Conceding that African-Ameri-
cans have made considerable heady
way in climbing to managerial posi-
tions, she revealed that few of them
feel comfortable: “Blacks inmanage-
nalpositionspayahighcostof stress."
According to results of her own study,
Black managers frquently complained
thatthey do receive authority compa-
rable to that their white colleagues
get: ”Some whites feeldevaluedwhen
they have to deal with a Black boss."
She notes with sadness that most
people exhibit these stcrcOtypes un-
consciously. .

Dr. Grace called a halt to the
“blame-thcrvictim approach to un-
derstanding and reshaping the strucr
turalandpsychological barrier facing
African-Americans in leadership.”
The AfricanrAmcrican expcricncc is
a unique one and as such it should not ,
be evaluated in that manncr, shc cxr
plaincd. He urged African-Ameri-
cans to adopt a “positive racial idcnr
tity" as a protection to this unfortu-
nate trcnd. Dr. Gmcc delivered an
