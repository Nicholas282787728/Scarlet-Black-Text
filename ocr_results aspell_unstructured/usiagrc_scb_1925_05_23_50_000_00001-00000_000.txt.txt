and Audience.

(James irork) ,

John A. McGee's llnlicasel Scandals
of 1925 as performed hciorc a packed
house in the A. R. H, auditorium last
night was notable both [or its suc-
cesses and for its failures. Timefull
melodies, pnlchritudiuous maidens,
subtle and wholesome humor made it
a. thing of joy. Atrocious lighting,
coarse satire, and innne ravings made
it, in spots. despicably crude. But
the good outweighed the bad, the aud~
ience was unmistakably pleased, the
management made both success and
money, and everyone is happy.

In a revue there are certain things
that can be done. and a number that
cannot. one thing that can be done
is to run down the curtain between
scenes, and spare the audience the
‘agony of watching the illusion—makers
at work. Another thing that can be
done is to control the switchboard,
and use colored spots which do not
turn a lovely girl's complexion purple,
or make her rouge stand out like a
bull's eye. Howard Wicks was sadly
needed on the electrical stalf.

The program started on tilneﬁhltp-
pv omen! Campus organizations,
\l‘llose public appearances Zil'e silli—
-sidized, and whose members use the
whole year for preparation, can learn
something from Al . McGee's Cost
about starting on schedule.

First State Meet

On June 6, 1890, the six leading cul-
leges of the stale met on the old Grin-

Iowa State intercollegiate track meet.
These schools were iowa university,
