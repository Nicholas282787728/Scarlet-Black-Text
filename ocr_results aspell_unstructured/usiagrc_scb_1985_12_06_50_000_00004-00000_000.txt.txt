Beaver goes to Japan

Donny Mchth is o seuim who spent his
Junior year in Tokyo on the GLCA/ACMJapim
Study Program. While studying at Wnsedo
Universtiy, Danny kept a dctniledjournal 0/ his
experiences and his perception of Japanese

, culture. The following observatmnd reflect Ills
impression uf modern Japanese society from
the unique position of o fmelgner living in
Japan,

Those treckles. That crooked baseball
hat. Those buck teeth. What red-blooded
American doesn’t love Beaver Cleaver?
He and his tamily epitomize the naivete
and optimism ol postwar America in the
1550‘s when a booming economy produced
more material wealth than any other na~
tion had produced in history and the bomb
kept Uncle Sam‘s enemies in check.

Domestically. Ward had a secure. well
paying ollice job and June cheerlully servA

times a day. Remember? She knew her
sons had unlimited lutures in a country
where minorities, women, the Commies,
artists, and other troublemakers knew
their place. Within ten years. however.
social upheaval iorever blemished
America's sparkling foreign and domestic
complexion. The nation came to realize
that the United States was not heaven on
earth atter all. .

The turn or events in the Sixties lorced
the American people to reconsider and re-
ject many archaic ”Leave it to Beaver”
values. But Jerry Mathers did not die in
Vietnam. Wally and the Beave moved to
Japan. .

and June. They also have bright lutures iii
