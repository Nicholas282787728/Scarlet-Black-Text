Trustees discuss

plans for

the campus’ future

by Jenrey liayiiioini

Discussion concerning the con-
struction of a proposed Psycholr
ogy/Computer/Mathematics
tPCMl building, whose possible
placement would necessitate
blocking Off 8th Avenue through
the campus. keyed the activities
of the trustees' meeting here last
weekend.

College President George
Drake stressed that the place-
ment of the proposed facility. part
of a comprehensive report last
December by the consulting firm
of Dober and Associated, was not
a definite plan and closing the
street would invole a good deal of
political wrangling. The street is a
major EastrWest thoroughiare
through the residential part of
town

The annual Spring gathering oi
the trustees did not anOlVe much
definite action and was given
primarily to discussion of future
plans lor the College and mingling
with students, ”This was not real-
ly an action meeting compared to
most Board meetings.” said
Drake.

Action was taken on tenure pro-
posals for live faculty members.
Approved lor tenure and pro
mated to Associate Professor
were: Robert Cadmus. Physics:
Timothy Chasson. Art: Jan
Czechowski. Theater and Daniel
Kaiser. History.

ilse Leitinger. of the Siology
Department. was not granted
tenure but already has an extend-
ed contract that will keep her at
Grinnell for several years.

The trustees also agreed on a
need to bring more native lowans
to the College in the future. Drake
said that he thought the size of the
student body could be brought
back up to [.200 by adding about 30
to 40 Iowa students per year.

The need for a new building for
the Psychology department arises
because of the poor condition of
Goodnow. where the department

Joint board

is currently situated. According to
Lhe Doher report, Goodnow is in
the same class of overall condition
as Mears Hall. Mears is closed off
at present and entering it is for-
bidden by the College.

According to Drake. the College
has until 1986 to submit a plan for
Goodnow to the local fire marshal
or it too will be closed.

Possible courses of action for
Goodnow include restoring it in its
original 19th century style and us
ing it to display works of art or
renovating it in a more modern
manner and putting in faculty of»
{ices and seminar rooms Another
plan is to keep the psychology

department there and build an
underground extension to the
East.

Trustees heard the status of a
proposal for a grant from the 01m
Foundation to build the FCM
building. According to Drake. the
loundation gives all the necessary
funding for the construction of (1017
lege buildings, but the chance that
Grinnell would soon receive Such
a grant was. "A long shot."

Drake said that Grinnell might
benefit from the fact that its pro
posal was for a Science building
and. “They (the Olin lt‘oundationl
have given a lot of science
buildings." He said. however, “It
Could be as much as four or five
years belore we know (whether
urinnell will get a grantl."

As the College will need to know
before then what it will do with
Goodnow. Drake said the trustees
are examining contingency plans
for either renovating Goodnow or
raising the funds to construct a
new building.

The College's endownment will
not be used to defray the building
costs because the endowment is
used to supplement the annual
operating budget. Drake said or
dipping into the endowment ror
building funds. “That would be
shortsighted of the College.”

SGA leaders sum up the year

hy ll.o.K. ouashie

in the future annals oi the Stur

this year may become known as
the year of the Three C's: Con-
troversy. Conservatism and
Credibility.

In an interview with the 5&3.
SGA President John Scharff and
Vice-President Pete Hautzinger
both expressed the views that the
'83-'84 session of SGA was Cons
troversial because. from the

votes on committee chairs

by M. Woirgaiig Schumann

This week the new Joint Board
approved its officers and commit-
tee chairs for the nextsemester.
including Dave Kopetman as
Parliamentarian and chair of the
Student Rules Committee (SEC).
and Ethan Cohen as chair of the
Political Activities Support Fund
(PASF).

There were three applicants for
both of the positions; the roles of
Parliamentarian and SRC Chair
are traditionally filed by the same
person. According to outgoing
Parliamentarian Eric Fisher. all
three were tested and InterViewed
by the ollicers.

The tests were not numerically
graded and it seemed that all
three applicants were competent
and had a basic understanding of
parliamentary procedure.

The names of the other two
students who applied lor the posi»
tlons were not released

President Matt Golden and
Vice-President Mary Kosmidis
explainedtheappointmentbysayr
ing that the primary criterion in
their evaluations was the appli-
cant's general knowledge of Joint
Board and that Kopelman was
quite experienced. having served
one semester as Younker Hall
President and having attended
many Joint Board meetings
before that. Kopelman had also
served as parliamentarian at
other times lor organizations near
his home,

Appointment to the position of
Parliamentarian is not subject to
approval by Joint Board but an
appeal was made oi Golden s deer
sion to appoint Kopelman ’i he ap-
peat was ruled out ol order belore
a vote was taken on the grounds
that the appointment did not con-
stitute a ruling of the Chair that
could be overturned

Later on the agenda was the ap
proval of committee chairs. to
which there was no substantial ob-
jection except in the case of Ethan
Cohen to chair PASI“. which
allocates up to $200 to finance
specific political activities by
campus groups. Many members
were concerned about Cohen's
neutrality or lack thereof in
dispensing these iunds. Cohen
replied to those charges by
repeated his intention to appoint
Paul MacCready. a conservative.
as one of the other four members
of PASF. thus balancing his own
vote.

Cohen's appointment was sus»
tained by a rollrcall vote Commit
tee chair appointments are sub
ject to Jomt Board approval. but
the chair of PASF is allowed to
make his own choices of other
members without seeking coniir-
mation. Cohen is expected to up
point MacCready as one member.
but the names (lithe other three
are not yet knouii,

Scharll lelt that campus
government saw more student in-
volvement this year than at any
time in his four years here. SGA
gained credibility in the eyes of
the administration and faculty
through its handling of the core-
curriculum issue by channelling
student imput and avoiding
student-faculty “shouting matr
ches.” according to Scharll

Both Hautzinger and Scharff
noted a definite conservative swe
ing in Joint Board membership

Addressing the recent releren-
dum that failed which would have
required that any issue of national
concern be brought to a referenr
dum before Joint Board could
make direct statements concern-
ing it. Scharff said bluntly, "It
was not a good idea,”

Believing that it would have had
a muzzling effect in that Joint
Board would never be able to take
action on anything. Scharlf
pointed out that under current
procedure only one out or tour pro-
posed statements on national
issues even got off the rloor, That
one was the statementdenouncing
the Solomon Amendment which
withholds Federal aid from
students not registering for the
draft.

In reference to the possiblity of
compelling representatives to
take a vote within the halls and
then voting according to ‘hall con-
science.’ Scharlr commented. "It
would not be democratic to force
students to become involved."

Hautzinger agrccd that the pro
posal to require student referenr
dums would have hindered SGA.
He said, "This political thing is
getting Out of hand." He felt that
the unwarranted attention
directed towards SUNS political
activity has clouded the fact that
it would first be a student service.

Some of the servmes the Scharlf
administration provided were in-
stallation ol typewriters in the

tract with the administration.

of four new 'l'Vs. donating parts of

Wednesdays and bleeding approx-
llnatcly sotltlu more through the
Trustees intt) the activities fund.

It also looked at l
the Georgia Dentel case. textbook
pricing and allowing oil-campus
sludents to eat on campus.

llautzingcr looked cautiously at
the growing tendency toward ruc-
tions within Joint Board. The crlnr
servatives delinitcly made their
presence felt and tlautliner thinks
it will be Interesting to watch
them operate next Fall.

Hautzingcr pointed to the con-
servative concern that SGA IS not
representative enough to express
student Views. lie wonders if the
conservatives will take the same
stance next year. when he
believes Joint Board will lean
more to the right til the campus
political spectrum.

In fact. llautzingcr feels that it
may he the liberals complaining
next year.

To the next administration.
Scharlt urged. "Keep up the
pressure.” One or the most impor-
tant issues. according to Scharff.
will be the evaluation of pro
lessors This is something he
believes Is not only beneficial to
students but to the newer pro~
lessors on campus.

ilautzinger ad‘ J that the issue
of academic _i ssure. in par-
ticular increasing the number of
buffer days. should not be drop-
ped. lie found it interesting that
next year's Christmas Break will
be shortened but the buffer days
won't be lengthened.

l-lautzinger concluded that. as
long as the application pool cone
tinues to drop. the administration
will continue to seek new corners
to cut and new controversres will
continue to arise.
