O The Central Agency

Among the ,many changes in donnitory regr
lilations this year, the modified Central
Agency, as it is now operating, seems to he
a hig —handed and inferior solution to a
complicated problem Under the present
set-up, there is a rllle against any solicita-
tion for laundry and cleaning in the dorms.
The dormitory resident is given the
doubtful opportunity to take all his clean-
ing and laundry to the Central Agency in
the basement of Clark hall, and he may
call for it there when it is ready. Mer-
chants are given the opportunity to pay
the operator of the Agency 20 per cent of
their gross receipts for this trifling service
The Agency seems to be the personification
of the often-libeled viciolls middleman that
raises prices and gives no real service.
Three reasons have been advanced for
the change from the noon—hour open solici-
tation of previous years. They are: (1)
That open solicitation, in the past, has
caused too much confusion in the dormitories.
(2) That the average college student spends
too much foolishly, and discontinuing this
line of solicitation will aid him to save. (3)
Operation of the Central Agency lost the
college a sizeable sum of money last year,
The fact that last year‘s Agency lost
money is a legitimate excuse for some
change, but the premise that stopping
laundry solicitation after the noonrl'lour will
eliminate confusion is silly. Now, most up—
perclassmen, when they want to send out
some laundry or cleaning, merely shout for
a freshman to run the errand. The process
is repeated for the delivery. Anyone living
in the dorms knows that this method re—
sults in as much, if not more, noise and so,
called confusion than last year’s runner

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

system.

That the new departure will ave the
dormitory resident money seems li e wish-
ful thinking. To date, it is true, we have
not been solicited for laundry or cleaning,
but we are still being solicited for such
items as magazine subscriptions, newspaper
subscriptions, a yearbook, i'ancy paddles,
pennants, stationery, pipes, jewelry and
varsity tickets

It has been suggested on one hand, that
the sartorial standard of the Grinnell male
could stand a bit of raising, but on the
other, under the dubious guise of institu-
tional hygene, we are to be protected from
an easy approach to clean shirts and creases
in our trousers.

It is unreasonable to deliberately find
fault with a situation without suggesting a
constructive alternative, but the present
dormitory Central Agency set-lip merits
such comment on the grounds that it is uni
fair to all, and any change in the situation
would be for the better.

Q Where There’s Smoke

Although the Grinnell city council’s objec-
tion to the College Bookstore’s application
for a license to sell cigarettes on the
grounds that the bookstore would be selling
to minors is inane to us, nevertheless we
do feel that there is real justification for
refusing such a permi ,

First of all, we can see no particular
advantage which might accrue from the
granting oli such a license. The profit from
cigarettes would not seem large enough to
offer any substantial monetary reward to
the bookstore or to the student body in
the form of increased dividends As for
the convenience of having a place to buy
cigarettes/ upon the campus, that too ap-
pears negligible, when one considers the
nearness of the college to the Grinnell
business district and the fact that the book-
store is only open for certain hours of the
day.

Furthermore, even though traditions
seem to be in some disi'epute at the present
time, it would be increasingly difficult for
the Honor “G" to uphold the time-honored
custom of no smoking upon the campus, a
tradition some students and alumni wish
to see upheld

But more important than these objec-
tions is the danger of alienating the sup
port the Grinnell merchants seem willing to
give the college. A conscious effort to
have the college and townspeople work to»
gether this year resulted in the Quarter
back Club, through which the business men
are working with the Athletic Department
for the betterment of sports at Grinnell.
We can not see the necessity of endangering
this new spil t of cooperation by having the
college enter into direct competition with
the Grinnell business men.

For these reasons, though not for the
puerile one advanced by the city council,
the Scarlet and Black is of the opinion that
the College Bookstore should not sell cig-
arettes.

Honor "G" Club

OPEN FORUM

From the very nature of your
“news” story in Wednesday's 15‘
Sue about the Homecoming dance
of Oct, 26m at 9 p. m. in the
men’s gym featuring Allyn Cas-
sel's band, one might be inclined
to believe that the Honor “G”
club is iuu by a bunch of in-
capable youngsteis who are ignore
ant enough to permit the local
newspaper to get a jump on them.

5 calls for a short explaliiir
tion.

May I suggest that the illus
trious repol'tcl' failed to mom
tion in his story the fact that
I put into the hands at a respone
sible staff member several mats
from which pictum of Allyn
Cassel and his featured voca-
list were to be printed in the

in audition, I gave this

* idual a good story about the
past successes of Allyn Casscl’s
hand. But the story is not com-

that someone lost this iniormai n.
”Misplaced” they told me. w h
this 1055 went the story I us
to have pub ishca. When i luv
sisted on some sort of a story,
the renders saw how effectively
my request (and I had Inuile one
only twenty times) was met.
Willie it is true that I smd
that we would have an excellent
dance band, may I mention the
fact that I never used the over-
worked word of Journalists,
"colossal" I will admit that the
(lance is going to be a good one
with a fine band, but I never
would describe this affair as
colossal. It will simply be good.
The facnities will be there to
make for a good time, We won’t
bother the Scarlet and Black
with a libel suit this time be-
cause I am partially responsible
for ever trusting those mat: to
some of your people; we always
say, “When they slap you on one
check, turn the other,"
