Author Says

Work Is Not
Spanish Virtue

Delights
Audience in Herrick
Chapel Last Night

Langdon - Davies.

“A glass of brandy. a cup 01' cofe
fee. and four or five hours in which
to sip and talk is the Spanish art of
passing leisure time,” declared John
Langdon—Davies. brilliant young Eng—
lish author and journalist, in a
speech. ”Spain Porsakes the Middle
Ages given in Herrick chapel last
night at 8 o'clock, “Work is not con-
sidered a virtue in Spain as it is in
Europe. the British Isles, and Amelie
ca," added the speaker.

Explains Rewlution

In explaining Spain's emergence
from the Middle Ages in the rcvolu-
tion of just a few years ago. the
author stated that Spain is not ro-
mantic. not decadent, and not Euro-
pean. The Pyrenees mountains and a
strong civilization of her own pre-
vented Spain from ever feeling the
influences of the Renaissance. the
Reformation in Europe. and the In-
dustrial revolution. The patriarchal
family was maintained in Spain de—
spite all these revolutions in Euro-
pean history.

“Two years are all that it has Lake
on Spain to advance from an era
comparable to Europe in the 15th celle
tury to a 19th century Civilization.”
he said. “In that time they have gone
over to civil marriages, civil burials
and civil divorces almost unanimous-
1y." declared the speaker. “The Span»
ish have completely thrown over trae
ditions." ’

Intelligansio Fills Positions

A most interesting fact of the rave»
lutlon, believes the authorejournalist.
is that the intelligensia of Spain are
filling the official positions in the
government. "Capitalism is either
dead or shamming dead in Spain as
in Europe and America. although it
probably still exists.” concluded the

- speaker.

Relating an anecdote that occurred
in 1926 during the famous "monkey
trial” in Dayton, Tenn. the author
explained Lhe difficulty of an English-
man trying to make an American
audience understand conditions in
Spain. He said. "English newspapers
told of Clarence narrows shrewd
trick of snapping his suspenders
while his opponent pleaded his case.
The English interpretation of the
word ‘SuSpender’ implies that it is an
article of clothing used to support the
socks. Naturally, most Englishmen
were amazed at the imaginative Specs
tacle of a man frequently reaching
below the table and snapping this are

Robert N. Norton. instructor in
history introduced. the speaker and
presided over the discussion that {ole

Crinnell college woke up this morn.

band of Drake university Bulldogs
had upset the highly—touted Creighton
Bluejays.‘ 23 to 20. The Omaha team,
smoldering from defeat at thelhands
of the lowly Drake quintet. comes to
Crinnell tonight for an albimportant
struggle with Coach John C. Trues-
dale-s rapidly improving aggregation.
Creighton. Missouri valley canfezu
ence champions last year. must beat
the Pioneers to stay in the running
for the 1933 title. Crinnell. already
twice beaten in conference competi»
tion. must prove her worth in this
game to avoid landing near the bone
tom in the loop standings.

. Vi’on‘t Help Pioneers
Drake’s surprising victory last
night will not help at all. for the
Bluejays will be ﬁghting mad to gain
revenge. Not the least bit dubious
about the outcome of the game with
the Bulldogs. Coach Schahinger's
team went into it expecting to win
easily, but was played off its feet by
the Des Moines quintet. which had
previously dropped every game on its
schedule,
Tonight the Pioneers' chief prob—
lem will be to stop Willard Schmidt,
leading scorer of the conference last
year. Cornie Collin who trailed him
by one point. and Captain Art Kiely,
the whirlwind Bluejay guard from
Montana. Schmidt. Collin and Kiely
were all members of the all—Valley
team last season.

Tallest in Conference
Schmidt. who stands six feet eight
inches in hl‘s bare feet. is the tallest
member of the Creighton team and
one of the tallest players in the
whole United States. Practically all
the members of the Bluejay team are
six feet or more. and they claim to
be the tallest cage outfit in the net»
tion.

Dick Ullrich will probably draw the
assignment of holding Conrad (Cor-
nle) Colhn down this evening. Collin
was an all—American forward while
in high school. and last season led
thc loop in scoring until the very last
game, when Schmidt came from be—
hind by dropping in 16 points,
