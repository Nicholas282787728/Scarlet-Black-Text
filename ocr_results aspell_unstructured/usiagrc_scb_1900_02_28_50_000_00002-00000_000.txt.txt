IT HARDLY seems necessary to
urge upon tlle students to attend
the glee club and orchestra cons
cert on March 9th. Therecor-d
made by these organizations in tlle
past is excellent and it is predictr
ed that their work this year will
be fully up to standard. Those
who attend will not be merely
"patronizing honie industry,” but
will also be sure ot a very enjoyA

able concert,
+

IN ORDER to spare ourselves the
pain of further disavowal of what
the college press ol the country
seems determined to force upon
us. we clip the following from the
1. s. c. Sludmlt: ”Verlly, a little
ﬂame kindles a Very large ﬁre.
Student obtains credit from the
faculty for certain editorial work
and joyfully announces the fact.
The VidlflE-RL’POYZZV and the Quill
read the announcement and the
Quill repeats it correctly but the
exchange editor of the Vl’dt/IerRzr
ﬁortzr says that SCARLET AND
BLACK is the favored paper. where-
upon every college paperin the
west hastens to reprint the Vida/:-
Rzﬂnrler version and in spite at a
sad disavowal from SCARLET AND
BLACK, that worthy juuri‘ral con-
tinues to be informed tllat its eds
itors are to recerve what they are
not to receive and the Vz’dl/tl Res
power prints a clipping trorn the
Daily Californian to the:eﬁect that
“the faculty of Iowa College have
recently granted to the editorial
board of SCARLET AND BLACK,”
etc, The faculty of Iowa College
will soon be under moral obliga»
tions to take such action in order
preserve the reputation of the col-
lege press or Iowa for accuracy
and integrity," We hope that this
may banish from the minds of all
who have been wrongly intormed,
the idea that we are enjoying prrvr
ileges which we do not possess,no
matter how much we may merit
them. We do not wish to be
understood as being opposed to
the granting of college credrts to
the editorial staff of a college
paper, on the contrary. it is our

humble opinion that such a meas-
ure is in every way ﬁtting and
proper and we would be very glad
indeed it it might be adopted here,
but since this is not the case, we do
not wish to appear to claim any-
thing that is not ours to Clalm, It
might be stated iurllrer, that if
the faculty should choose to take
the point or view recommended
by the Sillll'm/tlicrc would he no
objection among the editorial
staff of SCARLET AND BLACK.

account of the coldness of the

tel listening to only two numbers.
Miss Ethel Satterlec. accompanr
led by Miss Ollie Myers, sang a
Charming double number and res
sponded to a hearty encore The
second numher, also musical, was
a very enjoyable solo by Mr. Os:
wald Risser, accompanied by Mr.
Ellis at the piano. Next Friday
afternoon, a faculty meeting will
be held by the society.

Y. W. C. A. Notes,

We were more than pleased that
Miss Arnold. of Cornell, so kindly
consented to lead our prayer
meeting last Thursday evening.
Such fellowship cannot help but
bring us into closer relations with
our usigliboi‘ colleges. Miss
Mayme Sloellcili will lead prayer
meeting tomorrow evening, sub
ject: “Forgive!" Luke 6:37.

At the InternationalConvention
of the Student Volunteer-s held in
London last month, one of the

representatives tr-onl Amerrca was
Miss Efﬁe Kelly Price. '1 hi:
American delegates were given an
entire hour on lhur-sday and pic»
sented reports oi the wllole asso-
clatlon movement in America and
ol the Volunteer movement, Miss
Price speaking for the College
Young Women's Christian Assor
Ciatlcns,

At this convention twenty-[our
countle were represented. Aside
[rum tlle prayeirllfe and the strong
larth in lestls Christ as the livrng
and ull»powcl‘[ul leader or the for
eign missionary enterprise, per
haps the most striking iealure ol
the Convention was the place
given to the Watchword oi the
Volunteer movement. “The Evan-
gellzation of the World in this
Generation." It was strongly en~
dorsed by such speakers as the
Archbishop at Canterbury, the
Bishop of Newcastle and the Pros.
ident oi the Council of Free
Churches, not youthful entllllsir
asts but men among the must
brilliant, the most thoughtlul, the
most venerable of the Protestant

 

world.
