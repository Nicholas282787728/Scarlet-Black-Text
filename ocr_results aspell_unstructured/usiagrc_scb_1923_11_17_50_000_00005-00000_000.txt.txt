Varsity Season Opens With a.
Grinhell Trio on Negative
Side of Proposition.

TO FOLLOW OPEN FORUM
AND NO DECISION PLAN

John McGee, othii. Wehlin, and
Harry Reynolds Compose
Grinnell’s Team.

The first varsity debate of the year
will be held in the auditorium of the
A. R. H. at seven-thirty tomorrow
evening, when a Grinnell negative
team, composed of John McGee, Har-
ry Reynolds, and otha Wearin will
clash with a. team from the state uni»
versity on the question "Resolved:
That the World Court as proposed by
President Harding should be adopted

by the United States.“
Question is Timely

This debate will be of the horde-
cision, open forum type, which proved
successful last year. The question
is especially timely, due to the wide
circulation of World Court propagan-
da, and to the vital connection the
matter will have with next year's
presidential campai so a hearty re<
sponse to the open forum feature is
anticipated.

According to Mr. H. Clay Harshar-g-
er, the Grilmcll coach, each team
will be prepared to explain or defend
their positions against questions from
the audience at the close of the
formal debate. Anyone will he pri
leged to speak his mind, and the par
ticipation of the audience in the
decision will be encouraged.

In the constructive speeches, the
order of Grinnell’s speakers will be
McGee, Réynolds, and Weariu; while
in rebuttal McGee will be followed by
Wea , Reynolds speaking last.

This debate was scheduled only a
short time ago, and local debate
coaches have not had an opportunity
to shape an atilrmatlve team; but a
return contest will be held at Iowa
City, sometime in February, when
Grinnell will he represented by an
affirmative, and the university by a
negative team.

Plays Entertain Large Audience
By Capable Execution And
Well Handled Sets.

The plays presented by the Dra—
matic Composition class Saturday eve—
ning, furnished satislactory entertains
ment for 9. large audience. The pro-
gram was well balanced, including a:
it did a fantasy, a serious play, and
a deft English comedy.

Alfred Kreylnberg's "Manikin and
Mlnikjn" was a pleasant trifle, acted
in an excellent manner by Katherine
Thomas and Elizabeth Reynolds. The
setting executed by Harriet Rust
was the best thing of its kind We have
seen in Grinnell.

Those who acted in "The Fly“ of
the Shops" had very’poor material
with which to work. The Hecht-
Goodman play has little to recommend
it, but the direction and the actors
made it of absorbing interest. The
leading roles were capahly filled by
Genevieve Ashby and Franklln Gregv
cry. Thomas .Gonld and Gretchenl
Shaw were responsible for two of the
most convincing bits in the entire
Show.

Mllne’s “Wurzel-mummcry" is one
of our favorite plays, and we enjnyed
it immensely. Although there Was
evidence of miscasting, and a stage
door proved to be exceedingly elastic,
these discrepancies, common to the
amateur production, only added to the
fun. Bel-hard Craven carried off in»
dividllal honors very nicely, being
assisted by Jessie Baldwin, as Viola.

of them rate higher than the upper

lowest score, 72. was made by a girl.
The lowest score made by a man was
90.

The “probable geniuses," those who
stand in the upper one-tenth as judged
by the results of these tests, are

ranking.

in Ames they will cost $1.50.

I‘liln Reunion Dinner.

The Ames alumni have invited all
those making the trip to join them in a
reunion dinner at, the
Sheldon-Moon hotel in Ames following
the game. The cost is 75c per plate.
It is understood: that If the dinner can
be arranged for fivc»U.lirl.y or- six
o'clock the special train wlll be held
until after- it is over.

The plan for a Grinnell reunion din»
nor has met with favor on the local:
campus because it is pointed out that
the Grinnell special would return too
late for dinner here if it started back
as soon after the game as it could.
The Ames alumni are conﬁdently ex—
pecting a Grinnell victory and hope to
celebrate it with the undergraduates
who make the trip.

"Dcc’ Huff, who arranged tor the
special train, announced today that at

Prime Men for Stiff Clash
With Iowa State Eleven.

TAYLOR AND GRITCHETT
, MAY RETURN TO FIELD

Antes Machine Reputed to Have a.
Strong Attack — Behn to
I Behn Pass Good.

Coaches Elward and Hyland are

putting forth their best efforts this
iveek to get the team in the best con-
dition for the first of the two'remain:
lng games on the Grinnell schedule,
which will be played against the
Cyclone eleven at Ames this Satur-
day.
, Scrimmage was held with the
freshman squad yesterday afternoon
and another mix with the yearlings
was set for this afternoon. The men
came out of the game with Cue in
good condition and should be in the
host or shape for the contest with
limes.

Kickers May Return

Taylor and Critohctt may appear in
the game this week in which case
the Scarlet and Black team will be
greatly strengthened, Taylor can
kick well, is fast and can nab passes
in good fashion at the end position.
Critclrett is an expert open field run—
ner. He can also punt and drop—
kick well, which will make him in—
valuable in the backfield.
Scbarnwebcr showed up excepliun~
ally well in the game against Coo.
l-lis receirlng of passes brought forth
particular comment and it is possible
that he may receive the call at left ,
end.

Captain Nichols and Wood are both
scheduled for the tackles, where they
have been playing most of the season.
Cathcart and Duke at guards, and
Moyer at center complete the for—
ward wall and make a combinatlon
which held the strong Coe team to
small gains on smashes.

Same Backlicld to start

Jones will have the call at the
quarterback job. where he has been
playing in the last two games.

Smith or Critchett and Wing will'
be on the machine as halfbacks,
while chct will hold down the full<
back positlon. Sweet is a good pass-
er, as was shown in the cue con-
test when Grinnell worked the ball
down the entire field via the aerial
route, with the Grinnell fullback bur-l—
ing the ball.

Ames Ilas strong Attack

The strongest element of the Cy-
clone clcvcn is their offensive. Any
team which can score twice as many
points against Nebraska as Notre
Dame scored is unquestionably bound
to be dangerous. The forward pass
as used by the Helm brother-s. Amos
backfield stars. is especially effective
in gaining ground. Consequently the
Grinllcll coaches are emphasizing the
llcl'cnslve in order to stop the Cyclans
attack, _

In consideration or the Drake and
Car; games, Gl'lnncll is doped to win
the battle this Saturday. On the
other hand, the Kansas Aggies tied
Ames, while they won descisively
over the Pioneers. However, dope
has been upset so many times this
season that it cannot be relied upon
to decide the outcome or any contest.
Therefore the Pioneers are throw-lug
all former scores aside and will con—
centrate their attention on heating the
Cyclones.

Grinnell has at least an even chance
to cop this game, and with the kind

(of fight that was shown in the One

contest, to {lid them, the Pioneers
should put. up It Wonderful battle.

suould Grinncll win the game, the
Scarlet and Black colors would be
flying in fourth place in the Valley
with a percentage of .500.

Prof. and Mrs. R. H. Perring open—

Veil their home Sunday evening for is

faculty party. Catherine Allslzlnd,
