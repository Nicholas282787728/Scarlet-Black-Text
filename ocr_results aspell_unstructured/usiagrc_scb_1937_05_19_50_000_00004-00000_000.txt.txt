g‘SOMETHING NEW IN THE LINE OF
“IMPROVEMENT DAY”

Early last week when the Council of House Presidents
announced that the group would Sanction the annual spring
“Freshman Improvement Day,” thelc were rumors of dis-
content and dissention from the preps of Smith hall.

The freshmen gave as their basis of complaint the fact
that the school year was nearly over and that they con
sidered it too late for any reformation—their characters had
been molded. To back up their movement, the organized
group threatened to \l'ii'hdraw from intramural diamondball
'competition.

Representatives of the two factions met to ”iron out“
the disagreement. The uppel'classmen had no precedent to
follow as no similar “rebellion" had ever occurred on the
Grinnell campus. They were sure, however, that there
would be an “Improvement Day” and that the freshmen
would continue to play diamondball. The settlement finally
reached called for a “constructive program."

As a result, Saturday afternoon found the Smith hall
freshmen removing tree stumps from the campus, cleaning
debis from about the bushes on the north end of the football
field and levelling the college dump.

The Scarlet and Black does not wish to take a stand
as to whether the Smith hall upperclassmen or freshmen
were in the right, but it does seem to us that Smith hall
struck upon a good idea in their “constructive program

We think it would he a good idea if this were car
out each year. Why not turn one of the “Improvement
Days" over each year to the improvement of the campus?
We doubt if the frcshmcn’s character could be improved to
any great extent as the result of a one day program, but
the campus certainly could be.

_Gﬁ_
NATIONALISM SHOWS UP AGAIN

To put it mildly, we were slightly disgusted to find that
certain of our congressmen are so infused with selfishness
and that intense spirit of nationalism prevalent in the world
today that they would oppose such a small thing as the
sale of helium to Germany. The use of helium might pre-
vent another such tragedy as the Hindenhurg disaster, and
certainly where human life is concerned we should be able
to forget our petty fears and selfishness.

Aside from our personal feelings in the matter, how
ever, we must not forget the repercussions such hasty con-
gressional action may have abroad. How much better it
would be if we took the part of the good neighbor in this
affair, A generous attitude now could do a great deal to
further it spirit of friendship between Germany and the
United States which would be of incalculohlc value in these
days of uncertainty.

"College students pi nducc two kinds of literature, neither of them
good. Either they try revealing their own hour-ts, which ale not very
full yet, and which they are generally unable to interpret, oi they
decide to imitate some well-known author in describing artificial
situations which they know even less well than themselves." Vassar
college’s Pres. Henry N. MncCracken short-circuits the literary lights.

Let us add that there is nothing that you

that lack of money will not hinder

or prevent you from doing.
Therefore, as soon as you begin

saving money.
