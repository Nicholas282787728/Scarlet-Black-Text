AT LAST it seems as though the
long talked of and much hoped
for men's gymnasium is to become
a tangible reality and not a
shadowy dream All through the
siitnmcra well-directed and pelr
sistent effort to secure funds has
been made, and owing to the gen
erosity of the alumni and friends
or the college and business men
or crime”, the long coveted prize
is almost within out grasp. As
was shown in a recent article in
the columns of SCARLET AND
BLACK. about 511,000 00 has been
raised out of the 515,600 or) neces»
sary. Of this amount only 5700
has been raised by the students
themselves, who are naturally the
most interested in such a propose
21, Last year various subscripr
tion papers were put into ctrculm
tion. but owing to the uncertainty
of the undertaking very few could
be found ready to pledge themr
selves to any deﬁnite amount.
Now. however, when the project
is so near success that only a few
thousand dollars are necessary to
insure the beginning of work on
the building, it seems as though
it weretime ioi-the students thcmr
selves to take a hand in the good
work. SCARLET AND BLACK would
strongly urge that the subscrrpr
tion paper be once more circulatr
ed and a new effort be made, that
the students have some little share
in paying tor the gymnasium for
which others have done so much.
No one doubts thata new gymna-
sium is needed. The inadequacy
of the old one has been the sub-
ject of comment [or years. It
now remains to be seen if the (le-
sire of the student body is great
enough to cause them to be will-
ing to undergo a little selfrsacri-
ﬁcc to secure what they have long
wished for. The executive com~
mittee of the trustees will meet
tomorrow, to determine whether
it is feasible to begin work on the

IF THE inter-est shown by the

‘tenrtis players is any crltet'iolt of

then success he may expect to
send a representation to s. U 1.
0t which we need not be ashamed.
Every afternoon the courts are
full and the work is Carried on
with a zeal that is very commend-
able, A very encouraging feature
is the appearance of many new
men whose work shows them not
to be new to the game though
new to our courts. Some of these
are lilrely to represent Gi-iirtiell in
the dual tournament at S. U. l..

which is to take place in the near-l

future. It is to be hoped that
the students outside the Tennis
Association will show an
ed interest in the sport and send
a good number to the toul~
nament to encourage the
players. A tennis team repre
sents Griiinell as truly as any otlk
er athletic team and will advertise
the conege according as its sue
cess is good or ill. It is, therefore,
olimportaiice to encourage the
tennis players by hearty support,
the same as the players in other
branches of spolti

The charges against Maybury
and Cochems, once so strenuously
denied, are now admitted to have
been title in part, and both men
have been barred trout athletics
at Wisconsin. The success of the
Badger teams, however, will be
little impeded by this action. as
both Maybury and Cochcnrs have
left Wisconsin.

The executive committee ol the
W. l. A. A. has announced a corn
ference, to be held in Chicago,
Wednesday evening, Septcnibc
28, and the presrdents of the Unis

versitles of Illinois, Michigan and
Chicago have been asked to send
rcprcscnt' ivcsi All existing dif-
ﬁculties will, without doubt, be
settled at this meeting.

The effect of this reconciliation
cannot be overestimated, Nothr
ing is more vital to the success of
western athlctlcs than union and
amicable understanding between
the various institutions, and it is
an event of great importance that
such a result has been reached
