Joe Grim Feinberg

Slovakian journey

Joe Grim Feinberg is nor cxacily sure how he is going
so gei ro Slovakia yeresinee ihere is nor a good airpors in
die eouniry, he will probably have so ﬂy inio Vienna or
Budapesr and iravel from ihere. somehow, Feinberg will
ﬁnd a way. because he is required so be ai ihe Universiry of
Presov in Easiern Slovakia by mid»5cp(cmbcl:

Feinberg will spend ihe next aeademie year in Eslcm
Slovakia rhrough a Fulbrighi granr. whreh he was awarded
iwo weeks ago. The Fulbrighi program is an eaehange pro
gram whieh sends Amcriun siudenrs and reaeheis ro fore
eign universiries ro siudy or ieaeh while bringing foreign
siudenrs and proressors io ihe us.

Fcinbcrg is one orrhree reoenr us. eollege graduares
who wrll be srudymg in Slovakia ihrough a Fulbrighr gone.
The main roeus or his siudies will be eoursework on
Slovakian and Ukrainian eulrure, hiseory, and politics.
rhough he is also allowed a eerrain amouni orindependeni
siudy.

While raking elasses ae ihe
universiry of presov, peinberg
will also be eondueung intel»
views and eolleeiing orai hlswr
ries from members of ihe
Ruihenian eommuniry. an nth»
nie group ihai has been signiﬁv
eariily aireeied by ihe major p0»
lrueai arid eeonomie shanges of
ihe pass deeade.

While she eore roeus is supposed io be she eouisework,
chbcrg says that he is mosi enrhusiasue abour “being in
ihe mounrains wirh die people more ialking so people
and hearing whai ihey rhink" He's also exeiied because he
feels like he is going re “a plaee where academies are more
iniegraied inro rhe world around [iheml."

An anrhropology and philosophy doublermajor at
Grianell, Feinbcrg plans on airending graduaie school in
anrhropology when he rerurns so the us.

His “romanrie” plan, he explained, “would be so go on
io live in a village somewhere as a wriier," bur as he noied
sheepishly. “ihai requires, ro aeerrain extent, people so read
ihe srories, and I’m nor sure in have rhae quit: down yes.”
In rhe meanume, he plans io siay wirh anihropology, and
doing ﬁeldwork rhrough his Fulbrighe will provide useful
prepararion for graduaie siudies.

Alehough Feinberg has she near aeademie year planned,
he is nor sure who he will be doing during ihe summer
monihs before his deparmre. Ar ihrs poinr, however, he is
more focused on surviving ihe lasi round oirinais. When
asked lfhe was anxious aboui his irip io Slovakia, Feinberg
replied. ”Maybe I’ll siarr geuing nervous when i ssop be»
ing nervous abour rhings here."
