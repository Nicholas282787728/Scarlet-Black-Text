Requirements: Not a foundation of a liberal arts experience

Gtinuell's academic freedom is relatively rare—
many schools of all sizes impose distribution re-
quircmcnts in an effort to ensure that students get
the well-rounded liberal arts education they signed
up for. But we believe, consistent with the ideal of
sclfrgovcrnancc, that a liberal arts education should
be strongly encouraged and not stringently en-
forced.

The faculty recently voted to eliminate disti'ibur
tion requiieinents except in the case of early gradut
ution, We applaud them for reaffirming the open
curriculum, an essential part of Grinnell academics.
oftentimes, requirements are more restrictive than
cnriching,antl seem to punish students who explore
alternative academic paths like stttdying abroad or
pursuing a double major.

The open curriculum provides students with the
chance to explore different areas of academics and
cieate an individualized course of study. Students
should take advantage of these opportunities and
push themselves to take courses in areas that aren't
necessarily their strong suit. And advisers, many of

whom just voted to put more discretionary power
in student and faculty hands, should help advisces
create a well-rounded acadcmic plan.

But to help students seek out that broad liberal
arts education, the college needs to make sure there
are acccsSible course options in every department.
For example, science dcpartmcnts should offer
more classes tiiat are accessible
to nonrscicnce majols. Standard
introductory science classes are
often only helpful for students
who will pursue more course
work in that department. The
school should find ways to make
more subjects more accessible to
nonrmajors

This wouldn't necessarily mean creating ”easier”
classes. Classes can provide a rigorous study ofthe
basics that isn’t predicated on the assumption that
students will continue in that department. There
are great non-major Intro classes, but they often
aren't offered every year. And majors and non—ma—

:s’iérr “antral ‘

jors don't always have to take different classes. Intro
to Psychology is a good example ofan introductory
class that provides a good survey ofthe basics lei
both future Psych majors and students who might
not take another Psych class. Many Eilvironmcrv
tal Studies classes, such as men semester’s Intro to
Earth Systems and Nations and the Global Envir
roiimcnt, are also good examples
of classes that can appeal to a
wide range ofstudeuts.

Perhaps Professor Wayne
Meyer said it best in a previous
issue of the SEE: “The liberal
arts is attempting to understand
the world around us from a
variety of different angles and perspectives.” The
faculty’s vote to eliminate distribution requirements
is an excellent step in facilitating that process, and
the college should continue to develop a curriculum
that encourages students to get the type of educat
tion other schools impose.

 

CDO reaches out

The article “CDO trying to up student usage"
(April 6) would have been even more useful if it had
included usage statistics compiled by the career De-
velopment Ofﬁce annually. More than 83% ofthe class
of 2006 used CDO. As of April 9, 81% of the class
of 2007 had already used our services, so it appears
that we will match or exceed last year's rate. While
our record is good compared to peer schools, we are
still concerned about reaching the remaining seniors
who did not discover our usefulness in preparing for
scholarships, fellowships, graduate and professional
schools, postgraduate service positions, community
service, internship, extetnships, alternative breaks, ca-
reer networking with alumni and employment.

Grinnell students are applying for internships in
increasing numbers. we are just recovering from the
busiest day or our year, in which a record number of
students" including the reporter who wrote the ar-
ticlettsubmitted applications for internship grants.

This year, 115 students applied for summer int
ternship grants, compared with 85 in the summer of
2006, 79- in 2005, and 75 in 2004. Sixty percent of
this year's applicants used our new, more convenient
online forms.

In short, the complaint about the "early" deadline
for applications for internship grants does not seem
to be an important limitation on the growth of in~
ternship applications. In the past, the deadline was
before Spring Break rather than after, as is now the
case. While it may be true that some internship sites
don’t make their decisions until May, our experience is
that the majority of internship sites make their decit
sions much earlier. ltwe delay the application process
any further, we risk disadvantaging our students in
thc‘compclition with other colleges for those intern-
ship opportunities.

To extend our outreach we are attracting students
into the CD0 earlier in their Grinnell careers with

such opportunities as the greatly expanded Spring
Break extemShip program. which is available to ﬁrst
and secondryenr students as well as juniors and se-
niors. we had 87 applications for 46 externships.
which are opportunities for career and “lifetshadowt
ing" an alumni family tor three to seven days. Half
of these successful applicants were from the classes of
’09 and ’10. Early reports suggest that this program,
funded by the CDC and the Wilson Program, was
enormously successful with both the alumni and the
students, so the cxtcmship program will undoubtedly
grow As a consequence, the CDO should be on stu-
dentsY radar screens earlier in their time at Grinnell.

Students who want help in preparing for summer
opportunities or for careers after Grinnell are urged
to come sec us at 1127 Park Street or phone 4940 for
an appointment with a counselor.

Dining etiquette

Going offoflast week‘s article about food waste In
the dining hall, I'd like to say something else on behalf
of the student workers. In addition to being minds
ful and taking only as much food as you think you
will eat, there are some others things you can do that
would help out the student staff. First, take your silt
verware oftyour tray. Also, when you're throwing your
Silverware down those holes, you should be aware that
sometimes the students are changing the trays that
catch the silverware. Make sure your silverware is ac-
tually getting into the tray Second, during rushes at
peak times during meals, people tend to get impatient
and stack their trays. Don’t do it; it doesn’t help the
people on the dishline at all. Itjust means they have to
sort through multiple layers otcluttered traysThird,
‘if the top conveyor belt is going, put your tray up
there. It takes some of the pressure offoftlie workers
on the bottom line. Last, don't put individual plates,
cups or bowls on the conveyor belt. It makes it much

easier for these things to fall into the water trough at
the end of the conveyor belt (ifyou don't know what
the set—up in of the dishline is you should come back
and have a look. I don‘t think the workers will really
mind, especially it it means you become more aware
of what you're doing). Put everything on a tray. Some
student workers get really angry at people for doing
these things, but 1 don’t really fault anyone, If you get
a chance, work a shift on the dishline or in the back
area of the dining hall. You'll learn something about
the guts ofthe operation. so out otcourtesy and solit
darity With the studentworkcrs,tliinlt about what I’ve
said next time you return your tray,
