ters out of the way. Coach “Billy

‘ Shcnnan has, been giving his Pioneer
baskcteers o'nly light workouts Llius
far this week. it is expected that
heavy drill will be in order tonight,
however, in preparation for the brace
of battles with the strong Nebraska
crew here Friday and Saturday.

The hospital list is still somewhat
enlarged. Neither Captain Evans nor
whitehill are free from injuries, both
being somewhate handicapped by sore
spots. The brilliant performance of
Meredith in the last Sooner mix, how-
ever, would indicate that the fast little
Sophomore will get a chance during
the Husker series. Macy has not suf-
ficiently recovered from the injury he
received in the Cos battle to engage
in scrimmage, and he will probably
be some days before he again becomes
active, Fearing has been indisposed,
but is expected to he in shape again
by Friday.

Will Be Tough Buttlo

Campus opinion is that the Pioneers
will be forced to the limit to take
either contest. The Huskers are un-
usually strong this year. Thcy are.
in fact, the only Valley team which
is justified in contesting Missouri's
stand in the percentage column. They
have already defeated the Pioneers '
two contests at Lincoln, and likeu -c
took a pair of games from Oklahoma
without any great effort.

Well Chosen Program Feature of
Recital Heard by Large
Audience.

A large audience enjoyed the recital
given by the college orchestra in Her-
rick chapel yesterday afternoon.

The first number ,the overture to
‘A Midsummer Night's Dream" by
Mendelssohn was delightful. This
overture is remarkable in that it was
composed when Mendelssohn was only
eighteen years old and was exceeded
by none of his later orchestral works.
Beethoven's “Symphony No.1 in C
major" exhibited the skill of the or-
ganization and the violin concerto.
played by prof. David E, Peck and the
orchestra,‘ was unusually interesting,
especially the first movement which
was marked by \igol‘ and rhythm.

The entire program was performed
in a way that cvidenccd the careful
training ol the conductor, l’l’uf. G. L
Pierce, and the diligent work of eztcll
member of the orchestra.

if nothing else, the business expe '
enced gained by work on the endow-
ment drive will be enough to make
the whole thing worth while. The
numerous schemes for making money
would make a getatcirquic -Fonzi
sigh with envy.

Perhaps the biggest single business
venture is the undertaking of the Ca—
loca girls in taking over the fountain
at the Bates ltexali store. Calcca
girls now have lull charge of‘the

”Christ and—— the New World” Isl
General Subject For Daily
Lectures This Week.

iPERSONALITY, WILL AND ’
ACTION FACTORS OF LIFE'

“Christ and the New World” is tbel
geuelal subject which Dr, Henry
Chulclull King g. pl'GSldent of Obel'lm
College, has chosen fol the Gates
Mcmolial lectures, In the first lec-
ture of the series, delivered in Her-
rick chapel Monday night, Dr. Klng
approached his subject from a psycho-
‘loglcal standpoint and laid emphasis
on the importance of will and action
in our life. Wednesday morning he
discussed the scientific aspect of his
subject, and approached it from the
side of Llue values

llcllliilg‘ lo 1" site Sentiment

‘ Vc aie in danger pl’ yielding to a
passive soullmeutalism", he said in
the filsl. 190mm. "Thele is no state
01 body or nail—id but finds its end
normally in action, if not unduly bin»
tiered, The emotion must find an eXA
lpl‘essmu in action, if it is only in giv-
,ing up our seat in the street car DI‘
in saying a kind word to our grand»
‘mother. our ideas’are not ours until
we have expressed them in action.
we must lay emphasis on expressive
activity."
3 ”Character, influence and happiness
Cam only he achieved by action,” said
Dr. King. Character is an achieve-
ment, and must be accomplished by
the use of the will and action. Self.
,contl'ol is necessary in order to have
liniluence, because we must master
loui‘selves before we can master oth-
‘ers, and self- control must be ob-
ttalned by ”2101:. Dr. King pointed
out that every sport is an artificial

pleasuie of using the will against
them. and yet sports are a means
lfor ochieving happiness.
v Science Hits Influence

“Modern science has given the ideal
interest a. vision of a far larger and
more signi icant world," said Dr.
King in his lecture Wednesday morn»
ing in Chapel. He went on to say that
the world had been enlarged by as-
tronomy. by time, and by the percep~
tion of inner energy We are living
in a unified world, unified in thought
processes ,and in action. The world
jis one, and man is one in spite of zinc
’parent duality. The world is an evOl»
ving world. and a law abiding world.
All of this means that we are forced
to enlarge our conception of God and
His Will if we hairs not already done
so, because we cannot believe in a
God who is not larger than His
world.”

lSeniors Make Good Showing But
‘ Juniors Slow in Making
Much Progress.

With $2,003 on the books of the
student endowment committee to the
credit of the endowment fund, stud-
ent workers set out today with the in-
tention of making the pledging as
near 100% *fr'om the entire student
body as posihle. The senior class is
nearest 100% with only three or four
delmouents. Sophs, with $9,900 to
their credit Will probably have the
largest amount of any one class. Its
class machine has been most efficient
of any of the under classes. The
senior class will probably come near»
est the perfect mark.
Juniors Have Trouble

Juniors are having some difficulty,
if the figures turned in last night are
any criterion. They have only a total
of $5,605 to date, with only 62 pledges
in. Other committee teams will be
put in the field to help the juniors, it
was said today, if they do not have
better success today. n-eshmeu are

number of pledges and size of pledges
with $3,400.

A special effort is to be made today
to get everyone accounted for, as it
has been the plan to close up the cam»
paign this week. The committees are
out after 100% class, cottage. or or:
ganization pledging. Those who have
said ‘ihat they could not afford to

even a small amount, so as to make
the subscription representing the en<

livers extremely optimistic. and it was
‘predicted that complete reports’ could
