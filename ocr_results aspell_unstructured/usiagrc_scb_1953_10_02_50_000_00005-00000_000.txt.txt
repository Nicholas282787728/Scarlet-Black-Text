under a warm, surmy sky, the
Vikings’ hard and precise ground
game proved just too mudh for
coach John Pfihchl's somewhat
green squad.

The visitors had the situa—
tion well enough in hand so
they rarely called on their
passing attack sparked by
twin all-conference ends, Mory
Loeklin and Sal Clanciola.

Pfilsch Thinks His Gridders Can
Dump Twice-Defeated Siwashers

Hoping to end a ten game losing streak, the Gl'inhell
gridders take the field against the Knox college eleven at

afternoon in a Midwest con-

ference game. The clash will be the Siwashers’ third league

cocaptains Dave Eckley and
Dick iaogard. Ecklley plays end
and Bogard is a 170 lb. guard.
Bob Anderson, a 200 lb, tackle,
is also) a standout,

Knox boasts also a good [pass-
ing attack from the T formation.
Senior quarterback Ed lBeavaln
does the throwing, A blocking
back just returned ﬁrm the
armed services is Carl Hoehn
who was on Old Siwash’s 1950
championship contingent.

While finishing in a tie for
fifth 'in last year’s conference
race, Knox defeated the Pin-
neers, 33-25.

Weakehed by the loss of
sophomore left tackle Dick
Walker who suffered a broken
leg in the Lawrence tussle,
Coach John Pfilsch will ovum
heavily on fullback Don Hager
and end Dick Von Mai-or. Hegel-
carried the hall 4.2 yards a try
against Lawrence and von Maur
played an all-around game at
end and backfield positions,
while handling iii-re kicking
chores. He printed for a 36 yard
average.

Pfiisch has drilled the coiled

l‘hard this Week in preparation

for the Knox encounter, Thor—
oughly disappointed with the

he says that if the team plays
like they are capable of playing
they'll beat Knox.
