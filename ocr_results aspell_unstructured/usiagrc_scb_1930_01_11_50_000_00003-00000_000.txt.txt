 

SATURDAY, JANUARY 11, 1930. THE GRINNELL S ARLET AND BLACK PAtiE THREE

Debates Start
on February 3

Dates Set for Drake, Cornell,
Penn, Coe, Iowa State,
5. Dakota Debates.

Under the leadership of Coach
Rupert Hawk, Grinnell's varsity de-
bate squads are preparing for the
heaviest debate schedule undertaken
by the Pioners in recent years. A
former varsity debater himself, Mr.
Hawk has succeeded in lining up
many fine debates for this season.
Drake, Cornell, Penn. Anies, coe,
South Dakota and Nebraska Wesley-
an are the teams at present on the
schedule, and it is likely that a de-
bate trip will be arranged also,

Both men’s and Women’s debates
have been arranged. Eight men will
alternate in forming the teams to
debate t he advertising question.
They are John Snoddy, Jonathan
Danforth, Edward Spencer, Howard
Mollrath, Robert Blasier, Francis
Hawk, Richard Phillips and Paul
Klinefelter. The remainder of the
squad will work on the disarmament
question. These eight men are John
Perry, Harley Stipp, Harold Atkin—
son, Richard Sneed, Lee Henson, Lee
Alexander, Patsy Farrara and Dren-
nan Miller. The Women’s teams will
be picked from these girls: Mar-
garet Wood, Winnifred Neilson, Vera
Shonts, Roberta Vance, Dorothy Nel~

' son and Helen Cleland. -

A debate with Drake at Grinnell
will open the season, on Feb. 3. The
Pioneer arguers will defend the ad-
vertising question. Two days later
Cornell's Women's trio comes here to
debate the disarmament question,
with Grinnell taking the negative,
while on the next night the Grinnell
affirmative women's team will jour-
ney to Mt, Vernon to engage the
Methodists on the some question.
Penn comes next on the schedule,
with but one debate scheduled at 0s-
kaloosa, this one for women also,
with Grinnell taking the negative.

On Feb. 17, a. dual debate for men
with Cornell will occur, the Grinnell
negative team swinging into action
on the local campus. Three days let-
er, Iowa Slate college brings its
negative team here to debate the ad-
vertising question, and Grinnell's
negative trio appears on the lowa
State campus on the 22nd.

What should constitute the most
interesting debate of the season for
those partaking in it occurs on Feb.
25 at Des Moines, when Drake and
Grinnell will argue the advertising
question before the Des Moines A’d
club at a noon meeting, with an -
nell defending present—day advertis-
ing. On Feb. 27 the first debate to
be held with Coe for a number of
years will witness both Grinnell
teams in action in a duel, with the
affirmative team staying at home,
The question will be Disarmament.

The final debates of the season for
women take place on February 28
and on Mar, 3, when disarmament
will provide the basis of discussion
for a dual between Iowa State and
Grinnell. Grinnell will take its neg-
ative team to Arnes on Feb. 28, while
Iowa State comes here on Mar, 3.

The final scheduled debate for
men comes on Mar. 6 at Grinnell,
when South Dakota university brings
its affirmative trio here to debate
the advertising question, but Ne-
braska Wesleyan will also debate at
Grinnell sometime this season,

With many of the members of both
Men’s and Women's Forensic out
for the teams, along with other
high—class and experienced debaters.
the season promises to bring to Grin—
nell some of the best and most inter-
esting debates held here for some
years.

Reorganized Math
Clubs Hold Election

A reorganziation of the Mathema-
tics Club took place at 9. meeting last
Wednesday evening in Goodnow hall
of all Students interested in forming
such a club. About twenty students
attended the meeting at which Mau-
rine Hudson presided.

Election of Joyce Jones as presi—
dent, Margaret Atkinson as vice-
president and Ruth Williamson as
secretary-treasurer was the ﬁrst
business considered by the organiza—
tiou. Following that, Professor M.
M. Siotnick and Marjorie McFarlin
spoke on mathematical subjects.

Margaret Atkinson was selected
as chairman of the program com—
mittee with William Perry and
Marian Chasseli. Meetings will be
held on the first Wednesday of each
month when speakers will be pre-
sented.

The Math club has not been in ex-
istence for over a year since it was
not organized last year.

Campus Opinion

3
Question: What do you think of
the new rule prohibiting stndcnts
from entering the stack rooms in the
library?

Ed Brownbridge: I think it’s a
shame that conditions in Grinnell cob
lege have come to the point where
such measures have to be taken. It
is a reflection upon the whole stu-
dent body caused by the carelessness
of a few.

Eleanor Jolmso 1 think it is a
good rule because it eliminates theft
and absentrmlndedness of students
in carrying off books. and it does
away with teLerArtetes in the stack
rooms.

Deiin Bentty: The new arrange
ment is like that in all other college
libraries that I have visited or used,

'and apparently is a necessary pro-

tection against the misplacement and
loss of books. However, I should
like to see some system in effect that
would permit proved students to have
direct access to the books.

Doris McCormick: I think it is
very satisfactory as far as keeping
hooks in the library is concerned,
but it is rather inconvenient as a
time saver.

Ralph Hotchkin: 1t slows up the
system of getting books quite a bit.
They might do like some schools do
and have a libraraian to check up on
the students as they leave the stack
rooms. ‘

Aileen Cohen: 1 don't approve of
it because I enjoy going back in the
stacks and looking over books of
various subjects,

Merton Knapp: Undoubtably its
purpose is justiﬁed, but it greatly
handicaps any student attempting to
write a thesis because it limits him
from discriminating between many
references.

Marguerite Burden} think it is a
good idea It is all that could be
done considering the loss of books,
but as yet I haven’t found it very
inconvenient.

Donald Box: From the librarians
point of view it seems necessary to
keep the books from being carried
off, but from the students' point of
view it is inconvient. Personally I
would rather have the stack rooms
open.

Dean Nollen: I regret it very
much but it seems necessary because
we have had very heavy losses of
books which have been carried off
each year by the students.

M en’s‘F orensic Discusses
Chain Store on Wednesday

At its first meeting after the
holidays. Men’s Forensic held a diu-
ner and discussion last Wednesday
evening, with about eighteen in at-
tendance. George Van Nostrand de—
fended the chain store as beneficial
to the public welfare, while Richard
Sneed attacked the chain idea.

Van Nostrand pointed out that the
chain store, through much-increased
purchasing power and greater ef-
ficiency, is able to affect many econ—
omies that the independent store
cannot, and that it can therefore sell
at cheaper prices to the public, who
benefits therefore from the chain
store.

Sneed granted that the chair store
had caused the country merchant to
be "on his toes," but argued that it
was more for the welfare of the com-
munity to pay a little higher price
for goods and have the merchant in-
vest his profits in the community
than to pay less and have the prifits
of an enterprise be diverted to an
agency having little interest in the
welfare or the community.

An open forum discussion followed
the informal arguments of the two
men.

The secret marriage of Lucile
Hays, '27, and Lehrl Fritz, alt-'21,
which took place July 14 at Cedar
Rapids was announced Christ-
mas day. Mr, and Mrs. Fritz arc liv»
ing in Grinnell.

Valley Teams Beat
Big Six Opponents

The old question as [0 whether
basketball as played in the Valley or
as played in the Big Six is the bets
ter brand was raised with a bang this
week when Oklahoma A. and M. ad—
ministered a defeat Tuesday to what
is supposedly the strongest 'team in
the Big Six~the University of Okla»
homa, champions of the last-mane
tioned loop.

Since Creighton, another member
of the Valley, had previously beaten
the Aggies decisively in two games,
the quality of valley basketball for
this season seems at present of a
superior quality. A lineup as to the
real strength of Oklahoma, however,
will be provided tonight when the
University of Kansas, thrice winner

able to produce another masterpiece
of oratory this year in awarding that
simple brown hat to the modest seni-
or man who has “gotten by the big»
gest" with the least effort? If so,
what great speech will he paraphrase
this year? Will he enact the role of
Billy Sunday and sing “Throw Out
The Life Line" as he lightly tosses
the hat onto the awaiting, expect-
ant liead of said senior, or will he7
no, it is unthinkable that he should
have to wear the hat himself!

Anyway, all those who love to
play tilde—andrseek, drop the hand-
kerchief and similar games on the
dance ﬂoor anticipate the remainder
of the year with bated breath. After
reading this program of entertain-
ments, the college will duly say to
parents anxious to send their sons
and daughters to the “right type of
College": “Just look at our fine, mod-
ern program of social lif " But the
real insight into Grinnell's social life
as revealed in the program printed
today comes only in listening to the
enthusiastic male fear into the build—
ing at 11:45 p. m., cast himself in a
chair before the assembing mob of
his associates also returning from
the dance and mutter: "Golly, gee

‘Wlliz, come, come (pardon the slang),

but that was some dance!"

F rats Plan Dinner .
for Frosh Writers

A dinner for freshman men and
women interested in campus journals
istic activities, followed with a pro-
gram of talks by various publication
and journalistic heads of the college,
will be held in the near future, if
tentative plans presented at the ﬁrst
meeting of the new year of Grinnell
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi are car-
ried out. The national honorary pro-
fessional journalistic group met at
the Varsity Tea room for noon lunch

by the Grinnell men and women
journalistic fraternities, Sigma Delta
Chi and Theta Sigma Phi, respec-
tively, and it is hoped that another
gathering of the same kind may be
held before semester examinations.
At the meeting Thursday sigma
Delta Chi unanimously recommend—
ed such a dinner and further action
will be taken as soon as Theta Sigma
Phi considers the proposal.

Bernard Tebbens, Hugh Curtis and
Robert Swift were appointed as a
committee to arrange a series of a
professional nature for the Grinneli
group, and they will present their
plans at the next meeting.
