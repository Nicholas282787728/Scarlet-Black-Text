GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Cochran Holder
of 440 Hurdle
Record +0 Run

All American Roy Cochran
who began ' lining for Great
Lakes Training Station after
leaving Indiana university
will run an exhibition race
here Saturday in the thirty-fourth
annual Grinnell Interscholastic
Track and Field meet. Athletic
Director G. Lester Duke announv
ed this week.

Cochran Holds 4.10 World Record

Cochran's world record pel‘forr
nuance in the 440 yard hurdles on
a somewhat soggy track at Drake
last weekend indicates the caliber
of his running. He will come to
Grinnell from Beloit, Wis, where
he is running in the Beloit re-
lays Friday night. Howard Bogs
row former N. Y. Ur ouarter~
miler will be unable to compete
here, Dukc said.

As world indoor title holder in
the 440 yard dash, Cochran will
probably run in the 220 yard low
hurdles with the men competing
in the CoasGrinnell dual, Duke
said.

The presence of Cochran at
Grinnell recalls the days of Mor-
gan Taylor. Leonard Paulo, and
Chuck Hoyt, who made track hlS‘
tory here.

Strong High School Entries

The strongest field of high
school entries within a span of
several years will run here Sat-
urday. In the 100 and 440 yard
dashes and mile relay the field
is particularly good. outstanding
century boys include Harry Covey
of Roosevelt (Des Moinesl, Gene
Bane of Knoxville. Harold Wooten
of Toledo Juvenile Home. Don
Show of Marshalltown, and Bill
Winey of Jefferson.

Star quarter inilers are Covey,
