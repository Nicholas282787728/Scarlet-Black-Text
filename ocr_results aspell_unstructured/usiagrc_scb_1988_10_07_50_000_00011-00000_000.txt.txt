SCARLET AND BLACK

Netters continue to falter

by George Mchmsey

Okay. Here's the situation:
As the Pioneer Women's Volley-
ball Tcam concludes the ﬁrst half
of their season, they ﬁnd them
selves in an unenviable position -
- toward the bottom of the cone
fcrence standings. Any of you
who have followed this team
with some regularity realize,
however, that the team which
will take to the floor this week is
far superior to the team that
opened the season a month ago.
The differences between the two
are as clear as the differences in
judgement shown by Ben John-
son and Florence-Griffith Joyner
in the Olympics last week.
Striking.

While at one time Pioneer
hits were retrieved without too
much effort, opponents are now
finding that, unless they are
wining to "go horizontal", their
chances of keeping a Pioneer
"kill“ in play is slim. What is
more,'tJte defensive play of the
back row, diving, running to
keep those balls in play to set up
die l’lli, is impressive. So, I hear
you asking, why isn’t this team
winning?

The problem, as far as last
week-end goes, can be approached
froln two angles, one of which

revealed a major ﬂaw which must
be rectified if the Pioneers want
to go anywhere. The first prob-
lem is injuries which have oc—
eured throughout the season and
have now claimed Julie Kaster
and Melissa Fitzpatrick But in-
juries can be expected and the
team has done well in dealing
with them. Unfortunatly, one
glaring problem remains. That
problem is sewing.

In the match with Mt.
Mercy, a match the Pioneers
clearly should have dominated,
the number of serves which ended
up in the net or over the endline
was unbelievably high. The
women came out slIong, winning
the first game 15-9. the last point
coming on an impressive kill by
freshman Christian Hardigrce. In
game two, the team fell behind 4-
7 as a result of two straight serv-
ing errors and was unable to get
any momentum going as they
fell 15710. The final game was a
nailbiter and Grinnell showed
some real class in coming back
from a 5v0 deficit to tie at 9-9
behind the serves of Jennifer
Hughes and Hardigree. Sophor
more setter Sandi Tibhets gave
Grinnell an 11-10 lead on a Clever

the lead to 13-11. Mt. Mercy
proved too strong under pressure,
however, and stormed back to
snatch the game and match 15-13
on some tough serves and kills.

Throughout the match,
whenever the Pioneers seemed to
be gaining momentum a net
serve was there to deﬂate them,
AS Coach Cain said, "If you can't
serve, you can’t score," and this
fact became painfully clear to the
team over the weekend. It is, of
course, never too late to elimir
nate the problem and Cain plans
on doing just that. "Whatever we
concentrate on in practice one
week, we improve on in the
games following. This week
we'll be doing a lot of serving."
If those serves start falling in,
and if the team keeps on improv-
ing as they have been, the Pio-
neers will be tough come confer
encc time. And come conference
time, every team is 0-0.

Streak

The winning streak contin-
ues. After their overtime thriller
last week, the women's soccer
team made it the big two in a
row with-their t~0 defeat of St.
Benedictv on Sunday, which
brings their overall record to a
deceiving 26,

They had to travel all the way
up North to play it. St. Benc~
diet, which is traditionally re
garded as a powerhouse in soccer,
had just beaten a nationally
ranked St.Olaf squad. The odds
were therefore stacked immeasurr
ably against our Pioneers. Didn‘t

gamble.

The Blazers look the Pioneers
too lightly. Grinnell has more
than their share of respect now.
however. Stephanie Reisorf
scored the lone goal of the game
on a breakaway at the end of the
first half. Tough "d" by goalie
Asha Morgan and sweeper Kathy
Zabel helped seal the Pioneer‘s
upset. The up and coming Grin-
nell team will host Ripon at 2
pm. tomorrow. Doubtcrs aren‘t
laughing now. This team's for

Grinnell's Women's Tennis is
riding the wave of success After
defeating Upper Iowa and Simp-
son, the Pioneers are ready to
take on Loras and the University
of Dubuque this weekend.

Last Saturday, Upper Iowa
came to town for Parents' Week~
end. Despite the fact that the
match‘s time was changed to 9:30
in the morning, a few parents
managed to make it to watch
Grinnell dispatch Upper Iowa
easily, with a team score of 9-0,

Next, Grinnell, sporting new
red trshirts, hosted Simpson
College. The fashionable Pio-
nwrs easily won all of their sine
gles matches. Simpson forfeited
their number three doubles so
Coach Fairehild gave our number

back on track

one doubles team the day off.
The doubles team of Jenny Wang
and Elizabeth Banfield lost their
first set, then won the next two
handily, 60, 60. Lisa Jepsen
and Apryl Henry lost a long
match, which had almost lasted
until it was dark when Simpson
won the final set 6-3. Grinnell
ended up winning the overall
match S-ll "Not only did we
beat Simpson, but we looked
good, even though it was gosh-
damed cold," was senior Elizabeth
Wemer's comment.

This weekend the Pioneers
will be away for their match and
will return Saturday night. Buy
your favorite tennis player a drink
and ask her how the matches
