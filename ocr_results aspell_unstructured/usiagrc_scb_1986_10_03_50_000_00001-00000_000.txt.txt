lowaid. “One oi the biggest things to
happen” to the Des Moines area, accor-
ding to its organizer, has brought together
Iowa musicians including Grinnell Coir
lege's Terry King to raise money to beneiit
those Iowans hurt by the iarm crisis.

Early this summer more than so Iowa
musicians donated their time and talent to
make a record called lowaid, Record
stores all over Des Moines and some cen-
tral Iowa locations agreed to donate all
proceeds from the sales to the Food Bank
oi Iowa and the Iowa rarm Unity Coali~
tion's “Farm Crisis Hotllne" (which is run
by the Prairiefire organization).

Uniortunately, sales have been minimal
and no where near enough to cover the ap~
proximately $1100 cost of pressing the 2500
iorty-iive rpm records, according to co-
producer and Iowaid organizer. Jonathon
Rowal.

“It's not selling well . , To my

knowledge, we haven't sold any," Dave

Elliott of The Music Shop in Grinnell said.

beiore this reporter bought a copy. (See
review in Arts section.) The Music Shop
has Carried the record for almost a month.

In addition to the record, there have
been two Iowaid concerts, The iirst, perr
lormed‘in 1985, was a success, but the se-
cond. on September 7 oi this year, iailed to
garner any iunds for the reliei agencies.

“Everybody lost money on the venture,
and we were trying to raise money!”
Rowat said.

Why did lowaid fail to meet its expecta»
tions?

After all, the iirst lowald concert, also
organized by Rowat, was attended by over
1500 people and collected some $3000 in
pledges, according to Food Bank or Iowa
director. Kai-en Ford. The Des Moines
Jaycees made an additional $2000 donation

Governor Candidates
in Town

By Dave Jones and John Harrison

In the last ten days, both the Republican
and Democratic candidaws for Governor
of Iowa have made campaign stops in
Grinnell. Last Thursday, Democratic can-
didate Lowell Junkins appeared on cam-
pus and this past Monday the Republican
incumbent candidate Terry Branstad ap-
peared in town at the opening or the
Foweshiek County Republican heads
quarters.

Lowell Junkins, democratic candidate
for Governor of Iowa, characterized his
campaign as “challenging Iowans as we
challenge Americans to do something
positive about their own destiny."

Some of the positive things that Junkins
proposes deal with changing people’s poor
opinions or Iowa.

"We have to change an attitude about
this state, start talking about the good
things that we’ve got. And the bad things
that exist, we‘ve got to ﬁx,” he suggests.

A speciﬁc aspect oi his plan involves

$200 million to be “invested" in education,
Another $100 million would go ior research
and deyelopment, while an additional $10
million a year ior ten years would be put
toward student aid,

Junkins also proposes that valueadded
'ndustry be brought alongside oi iarmers
so that Iowa may exportiinished products
instead oi raw material. He said that Iowa
needs to take advantage of its natural
resources such as a work iorce that is 41%
more productive than the nation’s
average, a central location. and the best
educated young people in the nation.

“what we've really got to do is decide
what our strengths are . . . iind the
businesses that need the kind oi natural
resources we've got that they can’t get
anywhere else, and they‘re going to come
to Iowa," he added.

Much oi Junkins' criticism oi the present
government under Governor Terry
