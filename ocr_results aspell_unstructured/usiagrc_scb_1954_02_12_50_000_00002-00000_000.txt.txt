_Lts++ers To The Eclilor

l All letters must be signed.
Names will he withheld on re-
quest.

To the editor:

It is our hope that the chapel
will be the religious center of
the campus, as fully available
_to everyone as possible. For
this reason it is left open from
early in the morning until late
at night, and without police-
guard,

This does NOT mean that it
is (1) a necking center, (2) a
gymnasium, (3) a smoking or
drinking place, or (4) that any»
one at any time may use the
musical instruments without
permission.

Are a low ill-mannered, in-
people going to
force the administration to take
measures to drastically restrict

the chapel’s use? Let's hope not.
Sincerely yours,
Winston L King
