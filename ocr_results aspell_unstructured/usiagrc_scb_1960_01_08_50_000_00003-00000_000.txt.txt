AF Cadet States
History Of Salute

by Joe Latham

On Friday mornings, Grinncll
students notice that about one
out of every seven male stu-
dents on campus wears the uni~
iorm of the AFROTC.‘ These
men walk erect, are courteous
and salute one another. why is
it that these cadets salute each
other?

The salute is an ancient and
universal custom or fighting
men. since prehistoric times,

Announoement oi the award

Textiles, Collages ,
Will Be Exhibited I

A collection of modern tex—
tiles and collages by Mariska
Karasz will form the January
art exhibition in Main hall
foyer, Edith A. Stemfeld (art)
has announced the exhibition
opened today and will continue
through Wednesday, Jan. 27.

The show is circulated by the
'Bertha Schaefer gallery of New
York City and includes 20 items,
all available for purchase.

lute not only as a gesture of
greeting but also as an expres-
sion of mutual trust and respect
It is the basic greeting between
military men.

It is customary that otriccrs
are saluted and that the otiicer
return the solute. The courtesy
shown to an oificer by the
hand salute is a recognition of
the basic principles of command
and organization, while the re-
turned salute acknowledges the
essential part the enlisted air—
man plays as a member or the
military team.

since Grinnell’s cadets are fu-
ture Air Force orricers, they ob-
serve military custom and cour-
tesy. Therefore, salutes are rend-
ered to both cadet and detach—
ment ofﬁcers by junior cadets.
