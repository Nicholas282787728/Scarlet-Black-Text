The pep thermometer began to rise
today with the approacb of Grinnell's
opening football clash with Ames on
the Aggies' ﬁeld Saturday.

Permission for a special train of
four coaches has been obtained, and
present indications are that about 200
Scarlet and Black supporters will fic—

C. A. authorities in charge are of thc
Opinion that by tomorrow night the
125 tickets necessary for the train will
be sold and the chartering oi the

The team is going reasonably Well
now, and barring accidents during the
remaining days before the contest, the

‘LIBRERY WILL AGAIN
BE [JPENEI] AT EIGHT

Faculty Committee Responds to
Student Petition — Will Be
Closed During Chapel.

The college library will open at
eight o'clock in the morning instead
of-at nine as heretofore, beginning
next Saturday, according to a ruling
of the facility committee. However,
the library will not be open during the
chapel period as it was last year but
will be closed every day during the
entire chapel.

This wing comes in response to a
petition which was presented to the
faculty last week, asking that the hour
he changed. The petition was signed
by over two hundred studenm.

Much inconvenience was caused by
the nine o'clock plan, which was in-
stituted at the beginning of the year
Students who desired to usc the hour
between breakfast and nine o’clock
were denied the use of reference books
and it was found almost impossiblc
to study tcxtbooks as the recitation
hall affords no study room.
