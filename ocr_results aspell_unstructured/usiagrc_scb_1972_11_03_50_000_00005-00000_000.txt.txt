Wake Up: It’s Election Time

by Gregg Daifner

George McGovern is n fullrfledged
statist. Although he makes it diffir
cult to know just what he stands
for by continually changing his pro—
posals, there is a principle which
underlies all of them. I shall ex~
amine one which is symtoniatic,

Originally, McGovern proposed to
expl‘oprlate all of n mall’s income
above 12,000 dollars a year. Later,
he changed this to 20,000 dollars,
an equally arbitrary figure. The coil-
sequence oi this grotesque proposal
would have been to stop everyone
on whatever level he had reached,
and forbid him to rise It “upward
mobility" is the hallmark of econOr
mic freedom then stagnationand
decay is the hallmark of tile Mcr
Govern proposal,

The motor and future ofa nation's
production is the middle class. By
such a proposal. the ﬂmbitlon,h0pe,
and future oi every individual ex~
cept those on welfare, would be cut
off McGovern's proposalwasaimed
at destroying this classandits sym-
bolrthe sell-made man

Under communism, the government
forbids men to act independently,
but assumes the responsibility for
providing their livelihood With all
the mealyemoutlled talk about Nixon
being a fascist , it is McGovern’s
program which is closer to fascist
theory, it holds that individuals are

Neubauer Examines Local iSPIRG Group

by Curt correll

"ISPIRG is setting an example
at students really effecting parti-
cipatory democracy--which in it-
self can be revolution.”

John C. Neubauer, director of the
Iowa Student Public interest Re-
search Group, presented hiS Views
last Tuesday in an 5&8 interview
here. As the head of iSPlRCi he
has supervised its growth as a
state organization and has watch—
ed closely the development oi the
separate campus branches.

“The long term strength of
ISPIRG is ultimately dependent upon
the strength of the local boards.”
Neubauer, who spent a day and a
half at Grinnell this week talking
with students and administrators,
was asked to evaluate the relative
strength of Grinncll's local board.

rirst clarifying that it is unreal—
istic to compare one local board to
another because “the problems in
any one area are unique to that
area,” Neubauer went on to come
mend the efforts of the Grinnell
local board to involve the local come
munity in researching projects,

”With the number of activist stu-
dents I see on this campus,Iview
this campus as setting an example
for promoting the involvement of
people in the community in the legal
decision-making process,"

During an evening discussion with
local board organizers Michele R0»
thenberg and Harry Derderian, Neue
bauer also pointed out important tac-
ulty contributions that can be made
to research proyects. He noted the
value of a faculty adviser for apro-
ject task force and a faculty panr
el’s critique of a research paper as
excellent checks to insure accuracy
and adequate coverage of a topic.

Focusing on state level activities,
Neuhauer viewed the eiforts that
Grinnell students have devoted to
ISPli‘iG with high regard: “The in-

responsible [or production r but lets
the government assume the power
to dispose of what Illey produce.

Then came the McGovern proposal
to hand out 1,000 dollars 2t year
to every citizen (and then to make
him pay taxes on it) Regardless
of the apparent absurdity and one
vious bookkeeping “difficulty” of
such a proposal, there wasanimpor»
tant purpose to it. in principle, it
was to place everyone on the lev-
el of welfare recipients and hence
wipe out the diiierence between
earned and unearned income. This
would establish the government's
ownership of all income.

ls principle clear-7

McGovern claims to be a man of
“vision”, All he wants is to real-
ize theAmericanDream Well,there
have been two American Dreams
The first Was the dream of a coun—
try where men had “treedomfrom”
the physical coercion oi other men
and the government. Nobodyguaranr
teed success, but ii you strove,
success was yours to achieve-and
ii you didn’t work, to never realize.
This was the meaning of “a land or
opportunity”

The second dream Was that Of a
land where there was gold in the
streeu, instant successes and toil-
less wealth. It was the Vision oi a
country where healtli,wea1th, and

happiness could be gotten without
even trying it was justtllere, This
was the dream of aneliortlessexlse
tence

But material wealth doesn’t “lust
exist” it must be produced by men.
Those who desire wealth without
producing it themselvescanohlyob-
tain it by depriving others of what
they haveproduced.Andthereisonly
one way to achieve this-by force

The Ilrst dream is thatof the in-
dependent man, the producer. The
second is thntoithe brute, thethug,
thepal‘islte.

And today there is a man who re»
presents those oi die second
"vision”reGeorge McGovern.

The most important issue in the
election is individual rights, Mr.
McGovern’s candidacy represents
the ﬁrst openly statist vie for power
by a major party and consequently
the negation Of individual rights.

Mr, Nixon, however, is a “me,
too" middle of the roader, Jumping
back and forth between the liberals
and conservatives. His candidacy
does not represent a consistent
advocacy ofindvidual rights, audit is
doubtiul that he can be expected to
save our nation. But when compared
to the statism at Monern, Mr.
Nixon’s wishy-washy blundersseem
modest.

“iSPlRG's posture has been a low

key one in which its actions speak
for it," John recently attended a
national Public interest Research
Group conterence which enabled him
to gain perspective in examining
ISPIRG’s development in relation
to that of PIRG’s in other states,
“I listened, learned, and became
more confident that we are tak
ing the right approach for iowa ,,

ISPIRG has reached a crucial junc»
tion: the transition from a focus
on organizing efiorts to research/
action work will be effected at a
State Board weekend retreat beginr
ning today and running through Sunr
day afternoon. Neubauer urges
anyone concerned with the concept
of participatory democracy, and
making it work, to attend this re»
treat.

“This is the real opportunity ior
students to provide leadership to
their professional staff and to the
general public. based upon prob-
lems that the people themselves

have set Iorth.”
