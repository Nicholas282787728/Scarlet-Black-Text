Intramural Foo’rball
Flags Down Fun

BY NICHOLAS JOHNSON
Sports Writer

Walk ovct any Monday at about 5 pm. to
where the pioneer football team is practicing,
and you can hear the sounds oflincmcn dish-
ing out blocks and see the sights ofwlde re-
ceivers running drills.

Walk just north ofthe practice field, and
you will see and heat football of a different
kind being played on the ﬁeld in the center or
the Les Duke Track.

The football played here requires no drills,
discourages pancake blocks and has no need
for pads. All that is required for this brand of
football is a ball, flags and a few players look-
ing for fun. The football played here is not of
the orten super-competitive, intercollegiate fla-
vor; the football played here is flag football.

Flag football has been a mainstay in the
Gtinnell special interest sports program for
years. Its longevity is for good reason, accord-
ing to corhead ofSl Luke Flockerzi ’01: “The
whole purpose offlag football is to have fun."

Fellow intramural co-head Christine
Calton ’01 said, “I think flag football is a good
thing for Grinncll because it gets more people
involved in athletics.”

The cntettainmcnt-oriented goal ofrhc flag
football program seems to be the main draw
for many participants.

“I played lilag'footballl last year, and al-
though we came in last place, we had a great
time," returning player Chian Wu said.

Although flag football’s overriding goal is
to give Grinnell students a chance to have fun,
the organizers of the sport also aimed to in-
creased competition in flag football this year.

To do so, the flag football lcaguewill boast
two champions at the end ofthe season: a regu-
lar champion and a coed champion that plays
one female for at least one halfofcvery game,

Steve Larson, Director of Housing and
member of the student affairs ﬂag football
team, said he likes the idea of increased cm-

phasis on coed competition. “I believe coed is
the way to go,” he said. “I think its more run
that way. peop1e_think that football tends to
be a man’s sport—d say no way."

Erin lay '02 said the idea that rootball is a
male sport has not stopped the women from
playing hard on her team.

“Since our team is not extremely competi-
tivc, everyone gets a chance to do everything.
We rotate quarterbacks and receivers. Women
get to do even more than the men on our team
because we have more women," lay said.

Coed teams make up halfofflag footballs
eight team league. The teams play two games
a week, one on Monday and one on Wednes-
day, for four weeks. After the league’s regular
season is completed, each team advances to a
single-elimination championship tournament
seeded by final records.

For Wu, the highlight ofthis years install-
ment ofnag football will be “hearing the bas-
ketball team, Our first game was rained out—
supposcdly. I think it was really because they
weren’t ready to compete with us yet. Thats
okay. Well give them as much time as they
need to prepare,” Wu challenged.

lay said me best part oftbe season for her
has been bonding with her teammates, most
ofwhom are her floormates as well. “None of
us really have any previous experience," lay
said. “For that reason, we haven’t won a game,
but each time we play we have lots oflaughs
and run."

pot Larson, “ the best part ofrhc game is
just being out there with my colleagues and
letting the students know that we are regular
people, too," Iatson said.

Wu agreed that the camaraderie formed on '
the ﬁeld is what really makes flag football fun,
saying, “At first, we all thought this game
would be intimidating because we didn’t know
a lot ordrc other teams....put after you get a
few elbows and throw some out yourself, cv-
cryonc warms up to each other."

the crinncll College men’s soccer team ex-
tended its overall record to 3-1. The pioneers

rocked the ball past the Cornell keeper.

pressure in the second stanza, the pioneers were
able to notch a second goal when Palinski
played a far-post cross to Will lee-Ashley. Lee-
Ashley connected solidly on the volley and sent
the ball to the back ofrhc net.

A determined Cornell squad kept pushing
back and was able to narrow the gap to one
with about 25 minutes to playwhen a ball was
unsuccessfully cleared from the pioneer 18.
Cornell won the scramble and tucked theshot

It was thccontinued efforts ofpalinski that
sealed the victory, Late in the game he won a
