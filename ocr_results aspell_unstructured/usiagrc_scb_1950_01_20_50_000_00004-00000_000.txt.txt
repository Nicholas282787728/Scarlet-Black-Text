Cagers Blast: Lawrence 62-42.
Drop Decision To Ripon 69-58“

After losing 69.58 to a red
hot Ripon team last Friday,
coach John Pfitsch’s Pioneer
cagers came back Saturday for
a prized 62.42 victory over
Lawrence The Vikings were the
only team to beat Grinnell in
Darby gym last year. The win
last week marked the first time
since 1942 that a Pioneer squad
has defeated Lawrence at Ap-
pleton.

Ripon, hitting close to 50% of
its shots, rolled to a 41.10 half-
time lead, and the Pioneer’s sec-
ond half rally fell ll points
short. ”Doc" Weiske banged in
26 points to lead the scoring for
both teams, while Dave Dun.
lap and “Gas" Saunders top-
ped the Crinnell offensive with
20 and 15 points respectively,
.The situation was reversed
Saturday as Lawrence made
only 16% of their shots while
Grinnell netted 32% of their
attempts. Pleased by the way
the squad fought back after the
Ripon loss, Pfitsch was espec—
ially satisfied with the work of
sophomore Chuck Biermann,
and Walt Pokoj, who quarters
backed the team for much of
the game.

Dunlob and Saunders again
topped Grinnell scoring with 20
and 19 points each. The victory
over Lawrence was the second
conference win against three

losses.
