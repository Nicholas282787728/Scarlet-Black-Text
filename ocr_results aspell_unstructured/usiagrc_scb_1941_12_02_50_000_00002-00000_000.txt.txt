0 The Sunday Register.

We think it is time a voice was raised
in protest of the magazine section of the
Des Moines Sunday REGISTER. Although
edited by a Grinnell graduate, it is an
insult to the intelligence of the 375,000
readers of the paper. '

Granted that we, editors of a college
paper, are sticking our neck out when
we criticize anything as successful as the
REGISTER and TRIBUNE, we cannot
but feel the geneml appeal of the maga-
zine section is to mentality of third or
fourth grade caliber.

Another objection We make towards the
Sunday Register is the printing of pictures
similar to one on the front page of the
Iowa news section this Weekia four column
cut of grief stricken parents and relatives
at a murder hearing of their sons.

There is no excuse for such a gross
violation of personal privacy. The picture
was obviously printed for its news value,
but rather than rouse people's interest, it
could only make for a feeling of digust
towards the paper.

The REGISTER and TRIBUNE is funda—
mentally one of the finest papers in the
country, but it has some features which
are inexcusable.

Hell, intramural manager, and

was appointed to complete the
swimming program and to set
the order of events. The com-
mittcc will meet later this Week,

He added that the board voted
to grant Rcwson hall participa-
tion points in debate. Because of
a. misunderstanding as to the date
on which their debate was sche—
duled, Rcwson was unprepared,

"However," he added, “There
seemed to be enough justification
to vote them participation points,
although the circumstances forc-

ed us to place Rnwson last in de-
bate standings.
