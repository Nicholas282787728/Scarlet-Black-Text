programme expressed the matter ac-
curatel the melodies were authentic
and were selected and presented for
the delectation of the audience.

Stage Setting Effective

The stage setting was simple hut
effective, with old»fushioned high foot-
ligbts and jutting wings which served
cdually well for a ballroom and a
countinghouse. In such surround-
ings the numerous stage “asides"
seemed natural,—even inevitable ac.
cqmpenlmeuts. The usual efficient
work of the Experimental Theatre
staff was equal to every demand ex
cept that of making the Colonial cur-
tain behave decorously. The case
tumes were triumphs of antiquarian
research and modern adaptation. Mr.
Angus and the entire staff, companyr
and committee-ln-charge are to be
congratulated on their success.

It is to be hoped that this play can
be performed again, preferably in Des
Moines. Such a contribution to public
hilarity deserves more than one ap-
pearance. And next year the good
work should continue. I suggest a
revival of Uncle Tom’s Cab-
‘in with hioodhounds to our.
sue Eliza across the ice, and
three Tupsys, and plantation melod—
ies, and crying towels for the addi-
ence at the death of Little Eva. There
