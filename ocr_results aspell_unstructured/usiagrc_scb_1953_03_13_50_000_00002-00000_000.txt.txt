V 'Wanted: Unity

This morning in convocation Roger Perry rushed the
students of Grililiell to give him a vote of confidence next
Monday on his initial endeavor as llew Student Connoll

president. We imagine that many of you were taken by ‘

surprise by such a move. .

Ulldoubtedly tllis is the first time a Student Council
president has asked for a vote of confidence and it is also
the fastest length of time any holder of that office has
gotten down to work since we have been at Grinnell. Perry
should be complimented on his speed and his belief in the
“free voice through voting" concept; however, let’s probe
deeper into what he said before we give him the nod to
proceed.

Perry asked for a revision or overhauling of the con-
stitutions of the League Board, the Student Council, and
the Council of House Presidents in an effort to integrate
them. This was tlle gist of his five minute speech. We
gather that the vote taken next Monday will decide whether
or not Perry will get together with the members of these
other organizations and try to work out something better
than we now have in existence.

Let us make it clear now that we feel Perl-y should
have the chance to Work out his plan, but we believe
before we could vote for changes that might prove far—
reaching, we should like to know exactly in what di-
rection our Student Council president is taking us.

We should like to go on record as saying that Perry
was rather Vague as to what revisions he thought were
needed. It is ollr impression that theoretically these organ»
izations are somewhat integrated. As an example of integ-
ration between them we shall use the C of HP constitution
which provides under Article VII that this group shall
cooperate with the Student Council on all matters directly
affecting the men’s interests on campus. This same 00117
stitution provides that the president of the C of HP shall
be a member of Student Council and the vice president of
each hall is to be a member of the council.

The Student Council constitution covers the same
membership rules. This seems to lie integration of some
sort. . . .at least on paper. We will not discuss the League
Board constitution as it is now in the process of revision.

Perry is right when he says that the Student Council
needs more explicit power. When one compares this or»
ganization‘s expressed powers with those of the C of HP,
one sees that in defining them the Student Council consti-
tution is riddled with such weak words as “express” and
"review” as compared to phrases like “to be responsible
for,” “to promote,” and “to establish" in the C of HP
constitution.

Possibly the solution is change in the three constitu—
tions, maybe it’s one constitution for the whole campus,
and possibly it is change in just the Student Council con-
stitution. Let us in on what you really think, Mr. President,
and tell us which one you advocate. Then we’ll give you
your vote!

Grinnell Students Say . . .

Do you think south Younker

 

had the right to hold up the
Student council convention last
Saturday?

Bunny Mom, Loose hall sen-
ior: To a limit yes. . .I think they
far exceeded the limit, It‘s too
bad they had to ruin the water
show for the kids who worked
so hard on it.

Van Crawford, stson junior:

, They were last in position. 1 .it‘s
their right Next year the halls
ought to draw for positions be»
fore the convention starts.

Cicely Reincn Meal-s fresh-
man: I think they did. If We
restrict their right to hold up
the convention then we resrict
their constitutional right of free
speech

Could. we didn’t hold up the
convention by ourselves. We
were ready to go homc'by 9:15
until ‘Dave Dickson brought up
his proposal about teseating us.

Sarah Fuhrman, Cleveland
freshman: I think it made it
more interesting. It dld get a
little tiring after a while.

The above question was sub-
mitted by Nancy Nattemer.

‘lc the Model Lunch.

‘ Permit me to suggest that
meals be served picnic style out
side the stables until our main-
tenance experts are able to re-
‘vcrse e flow inrsuch a way
lthat it no longer lends its nox»
lious atmosphere to our breed
,breaking, The ironic aspect of
‘the hor ble situation is that
someone seems to have hired a
dozen br more secret agents
lwhose sole mission it is to keep
,all -the windows in Cowles
llounge shut tightly so that the
odor might not escape.

i wonder how it is that the
Model Cafe is able to serve the
meals they do for the prices
lthey do in a well ventilated
lroom. For ninety cents one can
lpurchase a pair of thick, juicy,
boneless pork chops complete
with salad (with choice of four
tasty dressings), bread and. but
,lcr, french-fried potatoes, and
,applc sauce. The further irony
is that Grinnell students, even
those suffering from apparent
financial hardship, are not al—
lowed the option of choosing
their own eating place. This
seems to be another area in
which student immaturity is the
stumbling block. ‘

The “we know what’s best
for you boobs" attitude on the
part of our officials coupled
with the “love me, love my
foods departmentj: slogan should
provide ample source for litir
gation on the part of our new
Student Council and its presi-
dent. l, for one, am weary of
one skimpy pork chop for snpr
per. I’m also anxious to elimin~
ate the microtome as a piece of
essential scullery equipment. It‘s
about time our dieticians lbegan
slicing our ham and beef for
human consumption rather than
for examination under the elec
tron microscope. I attend meals
to be nourished and not for lesA
sons in the cell structure of
American farm animals.

If we are to be served our
meals in a smelly, leaky, dun-
geon they should at least be of
sufficient quality to placate our
offended nostrils, During my two
years in the ll, S. Navy I was
served (or helped to serve)
2,190 meals, none of which was
not on a level or above that of
Grinnell college's culinary oft-
crings. As for the surroundings,
we’d have mutinied before tak-
ing our supper in the after
bilgcs, an appropriate analogy to
the present state of our dining
room.
