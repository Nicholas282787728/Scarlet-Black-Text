Men's basketball team snaps
twenty-seven year losing streak

By Jeff Wirtz

“We’ve stopped a losing streak,
and next year we'll start a winning
one,“ said Coach David Arseneault
after the men's basketball team won
their last three games of the season
and “ended an era" by having their
first .500 season in 27 years. The
Pioneers beat Illinois College, Knox
College, and Wartburg College to
end the season with an overall record
of 1 1-11.

“Illinois College made the mis-
take of trying to travel and play us in
the same day, and because of that,
theyweren’tthesameteamthatplayed
in their gym,” said Arseneault. He
added, “We got off to a quick start
and didn‘t let up,” and that lead to
Grinnell‘s 8561 victory. The Pio-
neers were lead by Steve Diekmann
with 27 points.

“Knox College forced us to play,
and werespondedby putting together
as good a half as we have all year,"
commented Arseneault. Knox was
down 39% at the half and tlten came
back to tie the game 47-47 with 13
minutes left to play. Luckily, that’s
when Jaeobsen took over. “Fortur

nately for us, Jake rose to the chal-
lenge, blocking 8 shots, leading all
scorers with 21 points, and grabbing
13 rebounds,” Arscncault said. Other
double digit scorers were Diekmann

with 18 points and Studer with thir- .

teen.

Arscncault continued, “1 don’t '

know how the players felt about the
Wartburg game, but they were as
loose and as crisp as they've been all
year. Diekmann scored 19 points in
the first half, and then after Wartburg
made an adjustment at the halfto try
to stop him, Studer exploded for 17
second-halfpoints,” Diekmann paced
Grinnell with 24 points, followed by
Studer with 20 andJaeobsen with 14
points en route to a 68—57 win.

Arseneault was able to take
Jaeobsen out of the game with 30
seconds lefton the clock: Arseneault
said, “I sensed in him not so much
excitementasrelief,thathe’d accom
plished something. He single-
handedly took a down-androut pro-
gram and madeitintoa very competi-
tive one. He has been effective for so
long and has always been a gentle
manandcenductedhimselfwithclass.
He will be sorely missed."

the start of this seasonAefend their
conference championship They {in
ished up conference play last week

conference rival Coe College. This
victory eamcd themaspotinthe four-
team conference tournament this
weekend.

In looking back at the Coe game
and ahead to the upcoming touma-
ment,Coach Theodore Eskildsen had
this to say: “We executed well against
Coe, and just to be in the position to

a tremendous accomplishment. We
can now truly defend our program’s
credibility."

Grinnell will face off with the top
team from the nonhem half of the
MidwestConference,LakeForest,in
Chicago tonight at 8: . Eskildsen
feels that the team will be able to
match up well against Lake Forest’s
strengths. “They are a quick, hard
pressingtcam which uses dribble pcnr
etration to do their damage," he said
of Lake ForeSt. “We have nothing to
lose, because they are the top-seeded
team, and we've already aecomr
plished our season-long goal. If we
can be loose and aggressive and can
keep our composure, I like our

chances.”

The Coe Victory, which gave the
Pioneers the ticket to the tournament,
can be largely attributed to the superb
play of seniors J enny Wood and Shan-
non Hancock, who played their ﬁnal
game in Darby Gymr Both finished
the game with 21 points. Hancock
added I 1 rebounds, and Wood handed
out 7 assists to go with her point
totals. Jennifer Kelley turned in her
finest performance of the year, as her
ball handling and shooting skills
proved to be a major difference in the
victory. She scored 15 points, dished
out 12 assists, and pulled down 10
boards. Eskildsen said of her perfor-
mance, “She knew exactly what to do

every umeshe got theball,andevery-.
thingCocdidfellrightintoherhands."

After the Coe game, Eskildsen took ‘
the opportunity to acknowledge com- .
munity support. “The communityA

mendous this year, and I'd like to'
personally thank the entire college.
