OMETIMIES in the midst of
S cramming {or midterms and

scrambling to write papers,
students forget to service or check
their cars before going on fall break.
said mechanicDanJones,who works
at Goodyear Tire Center in down-
town Grinnell,

Jones spoke aboutcar safety and
maintanenceWednesdayduringafree
workshopsponsoredbyGrinnell2(X)0
and the campus student organization
FEARLESS.

Jones said that many car break
downs can be prevented by routine
maintenence, most of which can be
done by students with minimal cost
or time commitment.

“There are little things that any-
one can do that will prevent problems
later,” he said “If you own a car,
theseare justthings you need to leam

to do."

Bells and hoses can be checked
forclacks orfrays. Every thrce years,
new belts or hoses should be installed,
Jones said.

"You should also look for leaks
or wet areas where there might be a
possible problem with the belt.”

Levels ofoil,anti—freeze, power-
steering ﬂuid and transmission ﬂuid
should be checked weekly. All the
ﬂuids should be checked when the
car is cold, except for transmission
ﬂuid which needs tobecheckedwhile
the engine is running and warm,

“Most of these ﬂuids are pretty
easy to ﬁnd in your car,” he said.
“Newer cars have everything labeled
pretty well. But if you’re never sure
about where to put something. you
should always ask or wait for help,"

Before you leave on a trip, you
should check your battery cables, he
said.

“As long as you're careful, you

Celebrating National Mental Health Awareness Week
16 percent of Grinnellians use mental health services

TRESSED—outsuldentssome

times need to talk with some

one. To help students deal
with the pressures of academic life
and other problems, Grinnell Col-
lege offers ﬁve free visits to the
Mental Health Center in Grinnell,
according to Dean of Student Ai~
{airs Tom Crady.

Crady said that 15.8 percent of
mesmdentpopulationusedtheMen-
lal Health Center {romJu1y1,1993,
to May 31, 1994. The national aver-
age for liberal arts schools like
Grinnell is 16 percent, he said.

Though all cases are conﬁdental
and reasons for student use of the
center cannot be revealed, there are
many possible reasons that a student
might go to the Mental Health Cen—
ter, said Donna Bailey, head nurse of
the college Health Center.

“Peoplemightuseitifmey were
having problems with relationships.
procrastination, academic work, fame
ily problems or if they had already
been in counseling before," she said

Students who feel a need for
counseling can walk into the Health
Center to make an appointment, get
assistance at Student Affairs. or can
call the Mental Health Center die
reclly, Bailey said

"If someone walks in, we ﬁnd
outil‘it is acute or not,“ she said. “If
it’s an emergency. we’ll getthem in
immediately. Otherwise, we’ll get
them in within three days.“

The college health center pro-
vides transponation back and forth
to the Mental Health Center. Stur
dents need only come to the health
center and let them know that they
need a ride. Bailey said,

“lthink students ieelvery come
fonable using the mental health ser»
vice.“ she said. “A large number of
students use it without any stigma
attatched.“

The Grinnell Mental Health
Center is located at46 4th Ave.

water and a toothbrush to clean the
battery, But you've got to becareful
that none gets inside the battery or
you'll have problems."

Students should check tum sig
nals, brakes and headlights to make
sure that all are in working order. Air
pressure in tires should also be mea
sured.

“On the inside of the driver's
doomhereis usuallyarecommended
tirepressure,"saidlones. “Butifyou
can'tread that numberanymore, you
can usually inﬂate tires to between
28-32 pounds, They should always
be checked when cold."

The hardest thing on a car is
what mostGl-innellians do on a regu-
lar basis g parking 2 car for along

period of time or using it only for
very short trips around town, Jones
said.

“It’s bad when they barely warm
up and then are shut off before the
condensation has had a chance to
evaporate," he said. ”It lakes a drive
of approximately 1012 miles to do
that,”

More car safety workshops,
which include information on how to
change a tire and what to do in the
case of a breakdown, will be held
throughout the school year.

The next workshop is scheduled
for this Tuesday at 6: 30 p.m. at Tiger
Ford in downtown Grinnell, Inter-
ested persons should vax [FE/XE»
