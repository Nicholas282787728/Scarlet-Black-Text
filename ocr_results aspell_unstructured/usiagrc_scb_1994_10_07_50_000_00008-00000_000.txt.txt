disappointed with the loss. It was a
great opportunity for us."

Dougherty led thePioneeroffense,
completing“ of 57passes forawhop—
pingS 10yards. Both his SlOyardsand
4 l completions setnewPioneersingle
game records, and placed him in the
all-time NCAA Division III single-

fortnance ranks fourth all-time in
single-game completions and seventh

The team racked up an astound-
ing 600 yards of total offense for the
game. All-conference sophomore

and junior co-captain Ian Shoemaker

all tallied over 100 yards receiving.

Although thedcfensegaveupSQ
points, coach Wallace was reluctant
to blame them for the loss. “It’s a
mam sport, 'and both sides missed
opportunities. We missed a few key
tacklcsandafewassignmentsngzunst
their option [offense], but Lheoffcnsc
missed a few opportunities as well.
We could have scored 60 poian and
won the game."

cerned with Coe College we just
have to beconcemed with Gnnnell,”
