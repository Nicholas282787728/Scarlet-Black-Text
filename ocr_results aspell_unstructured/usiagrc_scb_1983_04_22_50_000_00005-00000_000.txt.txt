Part 1: HOW to Lie
Bob Stry/eer

The iollowing tips should help you to
become a more effective liar. Even though
it may be morally wrong to lie, we all do it
a except me. it is through careiul eke
amination of our greatest liars (former
presidents included) that I have been able
to compile this truly thorough list of suc-
cessiul lying techniques,

HOW TO LIE TO YOUR PROFESSORS:
Professors are the people to whom
students have to lie most often. Thus,1't is a
good thing that they are so easily led when
it comes to big, fat lies. In fact when one is
lying to one's professor, the bigger and fat-
ter the lie _ the more effective the results
are. “And you want me to believe,” the
professor begins, “that you couldn’t finish
your research paper on time because your
iamily was accidentally run down by Orr
son Welles? (pause) Okay, extension
granted.” One must also remember that
proiessors are genetically very emotional
and compassionate people. and iI a gigan-
tic falsehood fails, then one can always
burst into tears (but do not kick and
scream) to achieve the desired result.

IIDW TO LIE TO YOUR PKGFESSORS
SECTION QUIZ: DIRECTIONS: Follow-
ing are two fibs, one is appropriate tor
missing two consecutive weeks or class
and labs, one is not, Identify the suitable
one.

A, “I forgot I was taking Ther-
modynamics and Statistical Physics."

B. “Uh, I would have made it, but my
Mom was elected Queen oi England, and I
had to hang nd London icr all the cor
onatlori Stuff '

Obviously "B" is the best answer here as
it is so audacious. No protessor in his or
her right mind would admit that they
didn't hear about the first librarian from
Joliet, Illinois to be elected Queen oi the
Britains.

HOW TO LIE TO YOUR PARENTS:
Parents are much more inquisitive than
are protessors; as a result, one must keep
these lies very simple, As a matter of fact,
many times these lies are dependent upon
how well you have iared in lying to your
professors, indicating whether or not you
will have to lie to your parents. If you do
Ihave to “pull the wool over their eyes,"
and one always has to, a simple lie that is
based upon at least a partial truth is
always the best. Since most or you are
already experts at this form of trickery,
there will be no quiz.

HOW TO .EAT WITH CHOPSTICKS:
Grasp both chopsticks (in some manner or
other) in one hand, and transport the food
irom the plate to your mouth. Chew.

HOW TO LIE TO YOUR FRIENDS:
Don't ever lie to your friends,

HOW TO LIE TO YOUR PETS:
Household pets are incredibly stupid, and
will believe almost anything you tell them,
Tell a Pekingese that it is beautiful ~ and
it will believe you. It doesn’t matter what
you tell them because uiey can’t tell what
is true and what is not anyway. So why lie
at all to your pets? Because there are peo
ple out there who can't lie well enough to
people, and at the same time lie too well to
stoop to lying to planters and lampshades.

I was going to say something about “let-
ting sleeping dogs lie,” but I guess I won't.

This column is not intended to teach,
preach or answer, but instead it claims the
purposeofasking. debating, easing an em-
batﬂed conscience and offering food for
thought tas it we Grinnellians and par»

_ ticularly most seniors haven't already
overeaten in this respect).

Most ot the iollowing questions stem
from the fact that in just a few weeks
George Drake will be slapping me on the
ianny with a diploma and proclaiming me
ready to race the world.

My iirst question is, why are we here? I
am not simply reierring to our peaceiul axe
istence here at Grinnell College, but more
importantly I am asking, why do we exist
at all? I know it’s an unanswerable ques-
tion and yet it seems that none of us will be
able to choose a direction toward which we
can tocus our lives without at least giving
this question partial consideration, I am
not religious, so my response cannot
possibly rest on service to a deity. One
answer might be to ignore the question and
simply state, “I like being here and will do

‘my best to maintain my current status. . .
still others might respond that perhaps
by their existence they owe some service
to humanity.

Part of the reason I am discussing this is
that I realize I may never be able to afford
the luxury of doing it again. I may enter
the working world and never give the in
quiry iurther thought. (Besides I might
p055ibly come to the conclusion that I
answered the question wrong in the first
place, and then where would I be?) My
time and thoughts may become so consum~
ed by a wile and kids and hills and the

overwhelming concerns or dayrto-day lin
ing that ignoring such questions may be a
necessary adjunct to maintaining my sani-
ty

Actually, I feel lucky, in a sense'Altei-
all, Iain sure that a significant proportion
or the world’s population does not have or
has never had the time to consider the
question or questions such as “What can
we do about feeding the world's starvmg
masses?” or “How can We be sure that we
won't deplete our natural resources?" or
even "Can we stop pollution from destroy
ing the earth?" simply because they are
too busy collecting breadcrumbs.

lsuppose that all oi this leads to my next
question which is every bit as specitic and
answerable as the ﬁrst. That is. since we
have been tortunate enough to be able to
subject ourselves to the kinds of issues and
inquiries that are seldom discussed by 90
percent of the world‘s population, does
that, perhaps, endow us with some type of
responsibility that they don't have? Does
the fact that we are able to View the forests
and not only the trees make us special?

I don’t know. Perhaps my question is
begging an anirmative response and
therefore assumes, that ”service to
humanity” was your answer to the first
question (I can‘t seem to escape it). I don’t
pretend to know the solutions, I just telt it
was necessary to propose the questions in
the hopes that one of you could help me
out.

Normally, I would be very patient about
discussing these issues, its just that
graduation is rapidly approaching and Ar-
thur Anderson is knocking at the door. , .

 

 

“I see long spears
in fashion again”
‘ Steve Burnett .

I have a few suggestions tor the Relays
Committee. (I) Instead of the mud pit. how
about a shark pool? In this competition,
contestants jump into the PEC pool,
previously stocked with (We hungry great
whites. The object of the game is to swim
two laps. This event has proven extremely
popular with the college set, especially
among spectators. I must admit that I am
stealing this idea from a college in Min-
nesota, which has included this event in its
“Viking Days Celebration" ior three years
now, But I‘m sure Grinnell could produce a
team able to outswim that college's disap-
pointing score of last year. Three and one-
half to nothing.

You know, some of the littlest things are
the most frustrating. To illustrate what I
mean, I’ve compiled a list oi little things
that really twist my torquemeter. ti)
Toilet paper spindels that won't turn, You
pull on the toilet paper and all you get is
one little square. And there's just no way
you’re going to get the job done with one
lousy, stinking square oi toilet paper. So
you have to pull with one hand and turn the
spindel with the other. And even then the
toilet paper still tears before you want it to
and you have to put three lengths of four
squares together. What a pain in the bum.

Not all the ideas I write about in my col-
umn are my own. There are times when I
go around soliciting advice. I really ap»
predate the sincere responses I get. and I

are

know I shouldn't be ungratelul, but there
are still some things one should NOT say to
me when I ask for ideas

(I) Zaki patushka zineka to all batush

I’m pretty sure I like intellectual
discussions just as much as the next guy.
But there are times that, well, I think my
point .can best be made in the “wrong-
subjectat-the-wrongtime" list.

(1) I do NOT want to discuss problem
number tour or a math test [ive minutes

has just ilushed my entire major down the
