IN FAVOR 0F PLAN

The plan for "Regulation of Student Business
Affairs." presented to the student body more than a
week ago, has caused widespread discussion and
some opposition toward parts of it. The points
found to be least agreeable to many students are:

1. Section 12, which calls for each organiza-
tion and publication to have contracts involving
payment of 50 dollars or over signed by the ex-
ecutive director as an agent of the organization
or publication.

2. Section 6, part of which calls for counter»
signing of checks by the executive director.

a. Section 3, which calls for payment of not
more than 3% of gross receipts by the organiza-
tions and publications to pay the expenses incurred
in the director's office.

4. Section 10, which says that “any treasurer
who falls to present his books for audit in satis-
factory condition at the request of the director-
shall be ineligible for any office while in college
and his credits shall he withheld by the registrar
until audit is made and proper handling of funds
is shown; and. if a senior, he shall be ineligible for
graduation until these conditions have been ful-
filled."

It is not the purpose of this Director to com
tml how money is Spentmit is his purpose to know
whether there is money to spend or a future in-
come which will make borrowing advisable. Section
12 says, "the director shall sign all contracts cor-
rectly drawn for which the organization can make
proper provision." He may act as an adviser in
the case of printing contracts for publications, a
place where good advice is greatly needed, but for
other organizations "proper provision for pay-
ment" is the only thing he will be interested in.

In regard to the countersigning of checks by
the directorithe question comes up, “Will all small
payments have to he taken care of in this way?”
They will not. “A petty cash account shall he al-
lowed each organization as necessary.” Such an
account tor halls and cottages should be about 25
dollars, allowing them to take care of most of
their business from this account, As small pay-
ments are made from the petty cash it can again
be brought up to the original amount,

Some means of bearing the expense of this
directors office must he set up. The Work of the
student auditor has always been paid for by the
organizations and has been fixed by the time he
has spent. It has been taken from their funds be-
fore they are turned over to the organizations.
Three percent is not a set amount, it is the max
imum charge, and will be adjusted to meet the ex-
penses incurred. It should not be greater than
has been charged in the past,

in the past it has been required that books
shall be audited by the student auditor. However.
no means of enforcing this requirement have bccn
set up. The whole system is worthless unless some
“club" is given the director, and it does not seem
unreasonable for the treasurer or business mane
ager to present his books for audit two or threc
times a semester.

Under this plan every organization and publi-
cation will still have complete control over the
spcnding of their funds, most of their business
transactions will be cared for by the constant pets
ty cash fund, thus not complicating the payment
of these expenses by the countersigning of checks.
Banking through this office should not prove

. any more trouble than using the town bank

directly, and it will make two sets of exact books,
thus giving a check on all organizations.

a drastic change, yes, but not an unreason-
able or valuclcss change. Study the plan and comc
to your own dec‘ on. Try not to criticize its sep-
arate parts but consider the plan and its purpose.
Minor changes can bc made, incorporating the sug»
gestion of its critics, but for the present, at least,
the idea. not the wording or small details. is at
stake.

iKENT DU'NCAN.
G
AGAINST THE PLAN

The purpose of this article shall be to point.
out some objections to the proposed regulations of
student business affairs and to discuss what seem
to be weaknesses in the suggestion.

First of all, however, it. would seem that the
part of the system Whlch will set up a uniform
system of bookkeeping for all student organizar
tions, and which provides for instructing organiza-
tion treasurers in the keeping of those books, is
an admirable feature and one much needed. The
point cannot bc (lenlcd that some of our student
organization bookkeeping is not adequateitreas-
urers are not necessarily chosen because of skill
or experience in accounting. There is no necessity
for setting up a faculty-controlled and appointed
official, the director of accounts as advocated. to
give instruction to the treasurers and to check up
on the books. however. \Ve have already a stu-
dent auditor, who is elected dircctly by the stu-
dents, and who already has full power to set this
part of the system into operation. Thus, instead
of creating a new office, or of relinquishing con-
trol over our money affairs, we need only adopt
this part of the plan by simply authorizing our
own auditor to put it into effect. By this author»
ization, the students Will thus demonstrate that
they are capable of handling their own affairs. and
will have strengthened, unaided, organization ac.
count keeping.

On the other hand, objections to the regula-
tions center mainly around the aspect which pro-
poses the giving up of control over all income and
expenditures to B. director, who would not be a
student representative; over Whom the students
would have absolutely ua control since he would
be appointed by a faculty committee and respon-
sible to that committee alone. These objections
may be summarized under two main headings:

1. The plan calls for the complete surrender of
student control over student financial matters?
which are the most important matters of any
group, since all activity depends upon the where—
withall to carry it out.

2. The plan calls for too great a concentration
of power in the hands of one individual and ne-
glects to place sufficient check upon his activities.

The progressive action at the faculty and ad-
ministrative authorities of Grinneli has been to.
wards student control of those aspects of college
life which directly affect the student, reserving
only the right to interfere in the case of gross
mismanagement. Thus this plan is a. direct levers-
al of the Grinnell spirit of student self-government.

Consider brieﬂy, then, the powers that. are to
be given to the director and examine the manner
in which this power shall be concentrated in him.
All income in any iorm, cash, credits, or trade
agreements shall pass through the hands of the
director. who shall release“ them again only at his
owl: discretion; all checks against student funds
deposited with the director must he countersigned
by that officer, and petty cash accounts may be
allowed only at his discretion and not at the will
or the organization whose funds are being admin»
istered; the director alone has the light to require
audits of books at any time, regardless of the wish
es of students, and he, Without consultation will!
any group, faculty, or student, may request the
resignation of the treasurer of any organization;
and finally, the director shall be the only author
ized agent of every organization. empowered to
enter into contracts for those organizations. In
other words, with only minor restrictions. the div
rector may veto the will of any organization and
disregard its wishes. The argumcnt may be ad-
vanced that the director would not do thisithc
point is that he has unlimited power to do so. The
students will be giving away control over their
money affail‘sia control for which our Grinncll
student predecessors Worked long and hard to se-
cure‘and power once relinquished is not so easily
regained.

in conclusion, let us ask ourselves this guess
Linn: are We, the students, so incompetent that we
can no longer administer our own affairs?

G. Day Smith '07, Tells
of Unusual Pranks
of Collegians

By Frances Hansen

Class fights, piethrowing sprees,
and rules against smoking and
mixed dancing were some of the
high spots of life at Grinnell in
the early 1900’s as told by a. Day
Smith ‘07, in an interview yester-
day. Mr. Smith, assistant Sunday
editor of the Kansas City Star,
spoke at the annual banquet of
the Iowa High school press assoe
ciation convention last night.

Since the quadrangle and dormi-
tories did not exist when Smith
was in school, students lived in
town, eating together in “board-
ing clubs," some for men or wank
en only, some mixed, One or them.
the Norton club for men only, was
famous for its potato-throwing
and pic-slinging fights. After one
battle with chocolate pics, between
the two tables called Pikcrs and
Muckers, the curtains and rug had
to be washed and the room rc-
papered, Mr. Smith related.

Moors Called “the Shack"

Women in Mears cottage, then
known as “The Shack," gave danc-
ing parties. attended by ladies on-
ly. “One wealthy man threw a
mixed dance at the hotel," he said.
“and several students were ex-
pelled for attending." Smoking
was forbidden to the men as well
as the women. Although expulsion
was the penalty for getting
caught, some of the men stole out
at night to sit on the old wooden
bleachers and smoke a stealthy
pipe.

Even putting on her gloves after
leaving the house was a breach of
decorum for a Grinnell girl in
those days, Mr. Smith told. No
lady ever powdered her nose on
the street; in fact, no lady ever
powdered her nose. They were
taught sedate. proper conversar
tion.

Strict Regulations

In spite of the strict regulations,
student hie seems to have been
livelier in those days, if it may be
judged by the pranks Mr. Smith
described. One of them involved a
bet that a bashful young man

the dean embarrassed, and the

tombstone factory and set it up
on south campus. They iastened
to it a placard announcing that
the class of 1906, not peppy
enough to suit them. was bun'ed
beneath. “The tombstone cutter
wanted to sue,” Smith laughed,
“but luckily he couldn’t find out
whom LO sue.”
in Many Activities

Mr. Smith was president of the
1907 annual boald, equivalent to
the position of editor of the Cy-
clone. He was a reporter on the
Scarlet and Black; wrote for the
Unit, the forerunner of the Tana-
ger; and majored in the English
department.

Mr. Smith left school before the
end of his senior year to take a
position on the old Des Molnes
Register and Leader. He returned

iin June to he graduated, and went

from there to police reporting on
the Kansas City Post.

He worked on several different
papers and with the associated
Press before joining the Kansas
City Star 15 years ago. Mr.
Smith is married and has two
daughters. His wife was also in
newspaper work before their mar-
riage.
