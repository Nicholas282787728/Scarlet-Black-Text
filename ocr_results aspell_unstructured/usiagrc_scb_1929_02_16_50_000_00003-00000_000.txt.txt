Smith Hall 6

Langan Hall 5

Building Three 4 .400

Dibble Hall 1 ii .100

By virtue oi their sensational vic-
tor: over both Dibble hall teams
Monday evening, Building Four moved
into a tie with Clark hall for the in-
tramural basketball championship.
Despite the whirlwind offense by the
newly revamued team with the of»
tense centering around Duke and
Gray. Pour came (rom behind to win
the A game 25 to 18. iVolfe, high score
er of the season, was unable to play
his old position at forward on account
of an injury sustained in the game
with Building Three.

The B game was ragged but no less
close. Led by Sweeny, the Four team
outclassed Dibble's aggregation to
Win 18 to 11. Four has been favored
to win the cup by dopesters.

Gnmes Are Close

The intramural basketball
this year was more closely
than it has ever been before. At the
end of the regular playing season.
two teams, Clark ball and Building
Four are tied for first place both hav—
ing won seven aud lost three games
during the course of the series, No
arrangements have been made as yet
for the playing off or the tie but this
will take place some time during the
Week so that it will be out
of the way as indoor baseball starts
this Saturday afternoon and will con»
tinue with three games each week end
until spring vacation.

The intramural season was marked
this year by the {all of Dibble, champs
for the past few years, in V
position, Dibble lost many 0 their
men on account of eligibility or sick-
ness or the fact that some of last
years champ team are now playing on
the varsity team. Another thing
which was new in the eyes of intra-
mural iollowers was the phenomenal
rise or Building Fbur from the lower
positions which it usually occupies to
tie for first place. The rise of Smith
ball into third place was also unpre-
cedented since it has been a. long,
time since a Smith hall team ﬁnished
up its basketball season having won
better than fifty per cent of its games.

Chﬁrk Team Heavy

Clark hall was represented by a
team which was big and heavy with
two test men to break away from the
[lack in the pinches. Their attack
was a smashing one which was suc-
cessful in most cases except against
Building Four, which presented a, fast
breaking oll'ense aided by two dead
shots who piled up the score even
when ”cold."

Smith ball ended up in third place
largely due to their B team which won
tour games and lost one. Their big»
gest upset was in downing Langan’s
B team by the score of is to 15 when
they came from behind in the final
minutes of play to clinch the victory.
Building TWO had a smooth B team
and not such a good A team and just
the reverse was true of Kelly
Stables. The Stable boys but an A
team on the floor which was one
of the strongest in the elague but lost
to the Forensic boys, They defeated
Clark's A team by the score of 19 to
18 in the most excitic game of the in»
tramural league.

Wolfe Nears Record

Louis Wolfe. steller forward for
Four, was the high scorer when he
scored torty points, one short of the
record held jointly by Belong and
Gray. both of Dibble. McInire of
Kelly stables was runner-up with 36

The intramural indoor baseball race
will start today with two games, the
scheduled game between Kelly stables
and Dibble Hall having been postpon-
ed. The race this year will probably
be much closer since a great number
at Dibble‘s men have been made in-
eligibile by a. new ruling made this
year, Before the announcement ot
this rule, Dibble bad been a heavy
favorite to win the championship
again but this announcement has hurt
their prospects greatly. Building Five
and Building Two look like -tbe con
tenders tor the championship now
that Dibble has been eliminated.

o’clock. This is a number of the 1607 ‘
ture course, and Semester files will.
admit.

in his talk Mr. Brailsiord will make
a study at an Anglo-American iuturc.
This subject is of great interest at
present because of thc passing oi the
‘I'ecellt bill in the United states for a
’Coltlpl'ellellsive program or cruiser:
building that will probably result in
Britain doing the same,

bi Br. lsfortl‘s lectures are both
descriptive and constructive. He gives
i rid pictures of ilic and tendencies
in Europe, and on this basis at fact
sketches the changes in the world's
Orgzulzzltiou which no rm 1 race (I
\\'e are to dcvelop our civilization in
peace.

In his own country, Mr. Brailsrord
is best known as the editor born 1922
»to 1926 or the literary and pan cal
weekly paper, The New Lender. This
publication grew to have a circulation
lfzti' outside the limits of the English
speaking world and rapidly became
the mouthpiece oi the English labor
movement.

In three books he has been a pic-
necr oi constructive thinking on the
_pl'oblellls or world peace. “The War
or Steel and God," published a few
months alter the outbreak at tbc
world war, was a warning of the call-
sequcuces which must (allow the im.
perial rivalries or the great pow-e .
A League of Nations" was the first
modern book which attempted to
work out in detail the idea. of an in.

her “Yesterday and Today. Neither!
