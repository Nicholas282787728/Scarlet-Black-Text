Movie hissers:
beware of critic

by Bill Waldner

It’s Friday night in ARI-I
auditorium. Over the loud-speaker
system a voice is mumbling
something about smoking and
drinking.

,“Screw you Warren!” the guy
sitting next to me shouts at the
projectiollist whose name is Ted
and can’t understand why anyone
would Call him Warren

The lights dim down and the film
starts. In the opening scene a small
boy, the protagonist of the film, is
served milk and cookies by a nice
old Woman

“Thank you, ma'am,” the lad
says and suddenly the entire
auditorium exploda into a Violent
paroxysm of hissing. Shouts of,
“Sexist»pig-dog-dle-die , can be
heard.

lstand up slowly and the shouts
die down. People begin to look
toward the front row where I had
been seated. I feel that I am
watching myself from a distance:
a young man with a \vildreyed look
and a two weeks’ growth of beard
who is screaming, “Aarrghh . . .
the hiss-ssing. . . can'tstand it. . ."

I remove a sawedofi shotgun
from within the folds of my parka
and fire several times into the
crowd. Blood runs down beneath
the seats toward the front of the
theatre. it's not a pretty sight.

“Who’s gonna clean that up?"
someone inquires.

The State prosecutor presents a
brilliant case, asking that the
death penalty be handed down.
Many women apply for positions on
the firing squad.

In conjunction with the Japanese
program this weekend, the Akira
Kurosawa classic Seven Samurai
will be shown. ‘The story is of a
village of farmers who, defenseless
against the attacks of a group of
bandits, calls upon seven
masterless Samurai Warriors [01‘
protection.

Itwas this film by Kurosawa that
was the basis for the American
film of the '60'5, The Magnificent
Seven. In fact, there are definite
parallels between many Japanese
and American genre films. in
America we have the Western, in
Japan there is the chambara, a
simple sort of swordiight film.
And just as there are some artfully
done Westerns (Shane or
Stagecoach for instance), there are
also seriously done period films in
Japan. This type or lilm, including
Seven Samurai, is called jidai-
geki. Seven Samurai is a film that
shows the past meaningrully, but
not at the expense of en
tertainment. Kurosawa took great
pains to make his film both ex-
citing and artistic. You'll see not
only stunning photography, but
also some thrilling, breathtaking
fight scenes.

There is another sort of
“tradition" which is represented

by the second film this weekend.
The “tradition” is that of the
documentary, and the film is Grey
Gardens. Filmmaker Muffie
Meyer ('67), who made Grey
Gardens along with the Maysles‘

brothers, Ellen Hovde, and Susan‘ '

Froemke, will be on campus lor
several days this week to discuss
the film.

What you'll see in the iilm Grey
Ga (lens is a record of the lives of ;‘

Ed h Bouvier Beale and hen

daughter Edie. The women, though
born to wealth and social position, ;
had at the time of the filming been a
living in a run-down decaying seas
side mansmn in isolation from the
outside world, Grey Gardens is a
powerful and disturhing account or
a most unusual motherdaughter
relationship ..
The iilm is an example of the
documentary style which is called
cinema verite. This is a technique ,
or recording life and people as they
are and “in the raw" as the
Filmgoer's Companion puts it.
Cinema verite is characterized by

natural sound and light, and often a
minimum of editing. This direct
cinema approach is used in an
attempt to make films that are, in

The cinema verite approach,

questions. Keep in mind as you
watch Grey Gardens. what role the

have an excellent opportunity to
