otin the best interests oi workers to delay

e votes,

The Hostess may be considered manage-

ept, a union spokesperson said, And. the
pokesperson added, housekeepers were
ot’part oi the college's original bargains
i g unit

McConnell said there is no hierarchy
mong the Grinncll House iood service
mployees.

According to the National Labor Rela-
io s Act, management personnel may not
e included many union bargaining unit

prior to the first approval by the NLRB,

February 1 9, 1985

both McConnell and union officials say,

that they had agreed to exclude certain
suptervisory positions [rpm the bargaining
uni ,

The positions excluded were those of Stu-
dent Supervisors and forum manager.
None of the cooks, food preparers. salad
bar workers. bakers 0r janitors come
under this classiﬁcation

McConnell had received notice of the
iirst approval 15 days beiore the supposed
renegement by the union.

Before Friday, the Vote on the union
issue was to be held March 13.

On February 5. workers involved in the
planning sent a letter to all of the depart-
ment employees which read. “On
January 30. the local union (Teamsters
Local 90) officials received notice from the
National Labor Relations Board of an ap
proved request ior union organization oi
the Grinnell College Food Service. The
Management of the iood service was to
have received the notice the same day,"

The letter also explained that the
Management had been asked to post the
notice oi approval as is the custom in
similar labor situations. though it isn't
legally bound to do so, The workers. who
asked not to be identified. had delayed

distributing any information concerning .

workers' rights as they waited ior the let-
ter to be posted in the kitchens,

“I don't believe any message or
anything from the National Labor Rela~
tions Board. has been posted because an
election date has not been set. Otherwise
we are complying with all the rules and
regulations as defined by the National
Labor Relations Board.” McConnell said,
though he indicated that he had, in tact,
received the notice.

“They [the union] were trying to ex
clude [three employees] from the collec-
tive organizational process and we believe
that all food service employees who are
properly qualified should have a say in
whether or not they should have union
representation.” McConnell said.

Until Friday some workers had been
moving on their plan to rally support for a
union.

On February ii, a letter was delivered to
all iood service employees and Dave Mc-
Connell. who is an employee oi the college,
not the iood service. “We are at the
crossroads once again," this letter read,
“We can vote to either have a union which
represents us and have the protection and
benefits it provides. or to remain as We
presently are, which is at the mercy of the
management with many policy changes
being made which give little ii any con-
Sideration to the rights, work schedules or
moral [sic] of the GCFS employees."

The workers had rejected unionization in

1976 when the college ended its contract
with SAGA. a private contractor and
began to operate its own iood service

The letter mentioned the 1975 vote: “In
1976, when a union was first proposed,
many promises were made and a majority
voted to trust management, In return.
wages and beneiits were to be kept cums
parable to those of the Union [Local 90]
employees at Grinnell College. In the ensu»
ing years, wages and beneiits have not
kept pace as most oi us are lully aware.”

Attached to the letter was a listing Ol
wage scales ior B & G and lnald service
employees, The average hourly wage ior
all jobs was $725. Only one oi the ten per
manent positions listed paid less than $6.00
per hour.

Workers indicated that at least two iood
service employees who have been with the
college [or more than 15 years are paid
35.00 per hour.

Among the other issues addressed in the
letter are complete job classiiication, set
pay scales, firing and relocation policies
and grievance procedures.

Both 8 & G and the Maids struck during
the mid»seventies because of wage and
benefits disputes with ﬁre college.
