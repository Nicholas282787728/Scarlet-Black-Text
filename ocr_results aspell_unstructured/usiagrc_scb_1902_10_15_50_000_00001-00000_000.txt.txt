GO To AMES.

One or the Big Games at the SeasoniA
Large erowd Going to Amos.

It is the duty ot everyone who
possibly can to give the team their
loyal support by attending the
game at Ames next Saturday.
When a schedule is arranged as
this year's is, with but a single
game on the home grounds it is
somewhat difﬁcult to have student
support, but here is a chance with-
in the reach of all. All excellent
rate is secured it enough can be
prevailed upon to go and the tick-
ets are good on all trains until
Monday. The team wrll leave
here Saturday morning at 3 o'clock
arriving in Ames betore noon.

of rooters, Let us sliowthem that
ive are not lacking in spirit.

No direct comparison of the
teams can be made, as no team
has played both schools.

Last year two games were playr
ed, the ﬁrst at Marshalltown early
in the season in which no score
was made, the second at Amcs re
sulting in a score ot 23 to o in (a
vor of Grinnell.

This year conditions are some-
what changed, tor under the efﬁ-
cient coaching of Ristine of Harv
vard and with an unusually large
amountot materialto choose from
they should prevail over our light
team chosen from scant material.

All previous games this season
have been fought against great
odds in weight rendered doubly
difﬁcult because of wet fields
Andagainthegamemusibeplayed
against a team much stiperior in
weight, the condition of the Field
deciding whether or not this ad
vantage will be increased,

But was there ever a time when
a Grinnell team did not have to
Fight against odds? Every man
has got to play more iootball to
the pound than his opponent and
he has got to play it all the time,
troni start to ﬁnish, and if every
man goes into the game with the

resolution to play to the last ditch,
and lives up to that resolution,
we will at least not be disgraced
no matter what the score.

That the team is rounded into
shape physically is quite evident
from the fact that no substitutes
were put in in the Nebraska game
while it was necessary for our op-
ponents to use several.

cRiNNELL HIGH scrroor.
vs. osxncoosa.

The high school game Saturday
was rather a disappointment on
account of the fact that it was too
one-sided to be interesting, The
Oskaloosa team, tho most of the
men were plucly, was lighter
than Grinnell, in poor condition,
and was lacking in toothall ex-
perience. The sensation of the
game occurred when Gilley, Grin-
nell's fullrback, rcccived the ball
on a kickoff and went through
the whole Oslraloosa team for a
touchdown, The ﬁnal score was

354:, The game with Ottumwa
next week promises to be much
closer and interesting, while the
Waterloo game the Saturday folr
lowing will be far from a walk
away for either team.

 

NEBRASKA GAME,

'The Team in a Plucky Game Holds
‘ Nebraska Down to Three Touch»

ortnncil o.

In the second game of the sea
son as in the ﬁrst, Grinnell’s team
was obliged to play in the rain.
Nevertheless the showing made
was very pleasing to the friends
or the team, With a team of
green men they ivci-eahle on avery
muddy ﬁeld to hold the heavy
Nebraska team, which outweighed
Grinnell ﬁtteen pounds to the
man to the low score of I770.
This was much better than Grin-
nell had hoped tor and was cer
tainly a disappointment to Nee
braska supporters who had cone
ﬁdently counted on at least six
touchdowns. But even in the new
nicn, pitted against veteran plays
crs, John P. Watson‘s training
showed strongly in the second
half when Nebraska’s play was
not so ﬁerce and Grinnell
improvtng with every moment.
Nevertheless the score is a good
indication of the relative strength
of the tivo teams.

The game was Helen and in
teresting from start to ﬁnish,
though the Nebraska goal was
never seriously threatened. 0n
the otherth the westerners were
twice prevented from almost cer
tain scores, once by a lumble and
once by the ending of the halt.
individually Gl'innell‘s men shows
edup as ivellascould behopedfor,
livcry man played all the football
he had in hull and after the ﬁrst
touchdown which was made ill a
tow minutes of play, Nebraska
had to ﬁght hard for every toot ol
gain. on punts Nebraskasllowet‘l
tip better than Kiesel and made a
couple of long gains on exchange
of kicks. The splendid condition
ot Gi-innell’s team was shown by
the tact that not a substitute was
used in the entire game. Ne
braska, In the second half, used
several subs, who may be used in
the NebraskaeMlnnesota game
next Saturday. The ﬁnal score
was 17—0.

The game showed tlial our team
is rapidly rounding into shape.
The new men have had the cxr
pcrience ot two hard games and
with half Grinnell’s team, ex-
perience just now means more
than anythingeise. Theprospects
of the team are much brighter
than at the beginning of the sea
son and loyal support will go'a
long way toward helping win the
remainder of the games,
