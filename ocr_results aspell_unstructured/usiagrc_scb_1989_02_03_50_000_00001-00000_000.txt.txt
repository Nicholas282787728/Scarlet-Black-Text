KEG House shutdown

by Brendan Shepherd and Jusica
Weisel

Firearms, ferrets, and feces

mark the demise of KEG House.

Residents of 1221 Park,
Kappa Epsilon Gamma (KEG)
House, have been forced by
Student Affairs to relocate to
residence halls for the remainder
of the semester due to alleged
violations of the housing con»
tract. The most serious of
numerous charges stemmed from
a report late last semester that
firearms were observed in the
house.

A Jan. 13 report to Dean of
Student Affairs Tom Crady from
Physical Plant described
violations of several housing
policies, including possession of
firearms and combustible
materials, harassment of custodial
staff, and violation of animal and

parking policies.

Suspicious had been raised
initially on Oct. 31 when Crady:
Diane Dougherty, director of
student housing; Steven Jones,
associate dean of student affairs;
and four members of Physical
Plant visited KEG House to
assess damage following a party‘,
Dan Tindall, director of Physical
Plant, commented, “It was a
bigger mess than I've ever seen,
not even in my college days.“

A memo to Judicial Council
from Student Affairs states,
“While in the house, it became
apparent that a ﬁrearm is or was
recently on the grounds of the
house due to several factors: (a)
the custodial staff person
responsible for cleaning the
house reported having found a
number of dead birds, apparently

SA/HAC selection process undergoes change

by Bmce Emond
Prospective student ad ‘sers

(SAs) and housing acti ties
coordinators (HACs) will undergo
a new selection process this year.
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Steve Jones said the changes are
not a radical overhaul of the
program but rather improvements
on already fine services,
“Basically we have decided to
change the process to create a
clearer distinction between the
roles of the SA and HAC." said
Jones.

Jones slztted that in the past
some student applicants were
confused as to what being an SA
or HAC entailed, partly because
students interested in both
positions received all their
information from one meeting
and were selected in the same
process This year‘s SA
candidates met on Monday and
Tuesday while prospective HACs
met at a separate meeting on
Wednesday In addition, Student
Affairs staff have nominated
students who they feel have the

shot by someone: (b) gUn shells
were found laying around the
house; and (c) gun shot holes
(possibly from a BB gun) were
found in several walls and
windows"

“Based on (this evidence), we
were concerned about the
possibility that there were
weapons in the house." Crady

said. The contract for none
cooperative college»owncd houses
states that “ﬁrearms, air guns,
fireworks, and explosives will
not be permitted in the
cooperative housest" Crady
claimed that the Violation of
weapons policy constituted
grounds for removal of the house
members

“We had eight guns we use
for hunting." said sophomore
Eain Murphy, “and none of them
were ever in the house...l own
two guns, a pump—action 12-
gauge shotgun, which would
blow a hole in the wall, and a 30-
06, which would blow a hole in
three walls and kill someone four
miles away." He and other
owners of ﬁrearms explained that
the birds and shells found in the
house were from excursions away
from the college. The house
members admit to expelling a
spring~aclion BB pistol in the
house early ﬁrst semester; how
ever, they claim that it was
removed from the house after it
was determined that it did not
comply with the ﬁrearms policy.
They insist it was the only gun
fired in the house or on campus

The Jan. 13 report also
charged the occupants of 122i
Park with harassment of custodial
staff, improperly disposing of
animal parts. and defecating on
the ﬂoor of the house.

11 alleged that on the
afternoon of Dec. 16, the
housekeeper of KEG House was
getting into her car to go home
when an egg thrown by occu-
pants hit her cart

“The students then ran back
into the house and stood in the
doorway and laughed," the report
states. Student Affairs staff
