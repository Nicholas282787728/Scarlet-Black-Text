That Noble Experiment

Anyone desiring 15 minutes of good hearty laughter
to open their weekend should take a leisurely trip up the
stairs leading from the north door of the administration
building to the registrar’s office.

Unless a lzl'rge group of Mr. Marble’s hirelings have
Worked most of the day scrubbing the walls, James Thur-
ber has been outvdone in glorious style by Grinnell stu-
dents waiting to register; probably waiting in one of the
lines which controlled registration eliminated

Now we don’t particularly condone u: lting on the
walls in pencil (but to anticipate a question: yes, when we
were three we did write on the walls at home) But it
causes a bit of awe at the energetic ingenuity of the average
Grinnell student that he could generate lines out of a sys-
tem which “got rid" of them, ‘

We still don't understand the benefits of controlled
registration But if it must be controlled, wlly not do it in
an intelligent manner.

A not so quick counting of names in the herd book
reveals that of about 826 students registering, 126 were
to have breezed through on Monday, 209 should have
“sauntered” through on Tuesady, 284 (over twice as many
as Monday) were scheduled to “sail” past the desk on
Wednesday, and 207 Were to have ”flown” through yester-
day, including the non—existent student whose name be-

To the editor:

who are we to say “I told
you so?" not when the new
registration system was anr
nounced the cries of “It won’t
work” weren't few or far beri
tween. The situation, of course,
doesn't affect those individuals
who so wisely chose parents
whose last names began with
A, E, l, M, Q, U. or Y. Li:
wrecks til-lose. idiots who
thought they could get by with
last names beginning with
every fourth letter in the ale
phabet,

There can be no justification
in a system which purports to
provide free choice of courses
yet excluded the second person
in line on Thursday morning
and the rest of his fellow idiots
from several courses before
they even had a chance at them.

There was 3 rumor that thel
cards for each course would bei
divided in founhs;one-fourth
for each day of registration}
Why did it turn ‘out to be justi
o rumor? Such :i device would,
have made idiots just imbeciles.

To the editor:

Our last Im’ce semesters at
Grlnllell have been made more
enjoyable through the efforts of
one called the Biegcl. By means
of incessant practical jokes and
:i never ending love of fun, he
has enlightened the lives of all
those around him,
Uniortunaiely, we’re losing
the Bicgol at semesters and he
is leaving us [or Michigan uni-
vcisity. it is too bad that Grin-
nell can't offer him the things
he wants. and that a large in-
stitution can. At any rate he is
leaving and the TWSAC of
Langan l-lall are sad and un-
happy about his parting.
However, we want ,to take
this opportunity to publicly
wish him goodbye and good luck
at Michigan. We hope he has
the best of everything in the
future. And, in the words of
that great Grinnell scholar. we
have this parting wish for him—

Thc buildings nnd grounds
department works in mystcrs
ious ways.

l am told they just installed
Venetian blinds over the nearly
opaque frosted glass windows in
the ease basement toilet. i
guess there’s still a big hole in
the wall and the sink is still
lying on the floor, but you can’t
have everything

Shortly ~beiore vacation the
drawstring on my window cur-
talns wore through and broke.

llously to the curtain rod. Two
(lays ago n man from bldgs. &
grds. put in a new cord. it
works fine now. “What’s so
aching about that?" you ask,

I'm wondering, first of all,
llo“ much they're going to
suck me. The fact that the
break was due to normal wear
has nothing to do with It. If
they decide that I broke it
intentionally, (the reasoning
supposedly is that I like to
struggle with impaired
drapes), I'll be assessed for ii,
without explanation.

And they have a room dam'
age tuition char-go that every-
body pays at the beginning or
the your so they can extract the
money without so much as a
“Rough bounce. brother."

No room damage charges
are itemized and the official
policy of the department is
not to divulge what the charge
is for, even on request, ac-
cording to an audience with l
the gods granted me last fall. 1

The dept. seems to have oi
unique Way of writing off;
building depreciation; they as»

though they're never listed se-l
parately when they do send:
bills.

One men’s hall was charged
so last week for allegedly
stealing a telephone port that
ihc dept. admitted costs about
a dime. (The phone still di‘dn'i‘
work!) if the remaining $3.90 of
the charge went toward paying
the employee for his time 1
figure he'd be making ten to
twenty thousand a year. Ph. D7]
(And tuition charges provide
ii'ept, money in the first place.)

llcocntly they sent southi

Yonnkel- a bill for over
$10. A hall member had broke
on a window pane and re-
pldced it himself. But they
still sent the bill. Charges for
mental anguish, maybo'l

Last week Cowles hall was
charged $3 for damage done to
the first floor phone. No studr
ents live on first floor, Appar-
ently no one knows who did it.
One person (call him. or her
“ziid") WZIS “misquoted” howe,
ever; The bill said zud? quote!
—verified the fact that three
studentsiunduote _ did the
damage. Zud has said repeatedly
that that is simply not the truth,‘
and Zud will clarify the fact for
anyone interested: zud has nol
idea who or how many people
did it,

Confronted with these facts
the god said, “Well, it was in
your llall, wasn’t it?" (Man,
the comeback of the year.)
The subsequent, somewhat
heated exchange that ensued
ended with .3 threat to increase
the fine. :
Eknmiples are legion l was
lined $2.38 ioi- room damage

icovcr that the 38C was my pro-
’portional part of a $20 charge

can find these holes I’ll give
you an engraved cigar blind.
‘Thic $2 was for a small, barely
,visible scorch mark on my door

’of the program with Brahms'

Wolfe Presen+s 'In’reresi‘ing,

And Saiisfying'

by Allan Kellar
in presenting the second per-,

cert Series last night, James
Wolfe demonstrated why he has
been called “one of the more
perfect pianists in the w
generation." l-lis program, vcryl
competently performed, ranged‘
from such standards as Bach’s,
French Suite in E Mnjor ondi
Chopin's ”Raindrop" Prelude to}
the strange harmonics of Wal-
ter Piston’s Passacaglio, a mum
ber new to the repertoire of‘
most pianists. ,

Opening his concert with the‘
Bach French Suite, Mr. Wolfel
took a leap of two ccnturicsi
for the second group in which;
he presented two contemporary‘
compositions: Piston’s Passacagri
lid and Paul Hindemith's Son—i,
ata No. 2, This sonata, although
perhaps less well known than
Hindemith’s Third Sonata is
quite typical of the great Ger-i
man composer’s works; the last
movement, called ”Very slow,l
agitated. very slow",
ticularly good.

Mr. Wolfe closed the first half

was parrl

Four Pieces for Piano, Op, lie,‘

which are among the last of
that composer's lpidno works,
Especially noteworthy in this
group was the Rhapsody with
its rich harmonies and the love-

Performance

but also for his choice of num-
ly E Minor Intemezzc.
After the intermission Mr.

: ,.
formance of the College Con Wane returned w play the Val“

intions on the home Abegg, 0p,
1, by Robert Schumann. In this
delightful work, which Schu~
mann dedicated to a fictitious
Comtesse Pauline Abegg, the
first five notes of the theme
are the corresponding letters
from the name Abcgg,

The last group on the pro-
gram consisted of four Chopin
numbers played with sensitiv—
ity and feeling. These included
on Etude in C»shanp Minor;
the beautiful “Raindrop” Free
lude; a Waltz in A-{lat Major;
and the rather difficult B min-
or Scherzo in which Mr.
Wolife’s very adequate technical
ability was displayed.

An enthusiastic, but unforc
tunately somewhat small, and
ience called Mr. Wolfe back for
4 enemies including Mendelv
ssohn’s E Minor Scherzo, Cher
pin's sparkling “Black Key"
Etude, and a Moment Musicale
and Three Waltzes by Schubert.

Mr. Wolfe, who soon leaves
for France under the exchange
program set up between the
National Music League of this
country and the Jeunesse Mu-
sicale of France. is to be com-
mended not only for his fine
interpretation and performance,
but also for his choice.
