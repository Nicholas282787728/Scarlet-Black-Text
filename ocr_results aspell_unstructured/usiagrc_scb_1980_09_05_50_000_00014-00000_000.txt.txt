Two years ago. the Board ol Trustees

tion or Mears to the National Registry
at Historic Places, the Board granted
Mears a reprieve in January or 1978, unr
til a teasibility study for its renovation

in the spring of 1978, officials of the

1college selected Ben Weese U] the
Chicago-based Weese, Segers, Hickey,
and Weese to draw up plans for renova-
tion and conversion. However, Drake
lelt_open the possibility that Mears may
be razed. “If the Board of Trustees
decides to preseve Mears, the college
will. embark on a tund raising drive to
iinance any plan," Drake said.

Drake addressed Mears In the con
text’oi the college‘s aggregate lacilitles

"The question oi Mears becomes

omplicated when we're conSider-
ing the psychology department and
Burling at the same time and still
renovating the dorms,” he said. "The
issue becomes a question oi how much
can the college take on at one time," he
concluded,

The priorities rating Drake uttered
presently places improvements on
Burling and psychology's needs ahead
of Mears' renovation.

Drake hopes to creative utilization
oi Mears soon, "Mears might jump
ahead or some other projects in line
because it's there crying ior something
to b'e-done with it," he Said.

Drake feels tlle most viable plan calls
tor'converting Mears into a new home
for the Admissions Office. "Admissions
needs more space, though it can sur-
vive another few years in its present
locatton," he said.

Drake iiatly ruled out the option or
Mears as a dormitory. "We need to
avéld the exorbitant expense of
renovating ior dorm purposes, The
question is, what is the comparative
cost oi converting it to oilice space” It's
an:educated guess that it would be
less," he said

The President describes Mears as an
impractical location tor the psychology
department, "It dei‘initely doesn't
make sense to move psychology into
Mears It would need climate control

and larger rooms. Thiswould be nearly
as expenswe as converting Mears into a
dormitory," he said.

The Admissions Ollice idea
originated in the Buildings and Grounds
Committee Drake set up. 'm planning
to CDntlnue the committee because
building problems are by no means
solved," he said, Drake disclosed that
Admissions submitted a request on its
needs to Weese.

Drake explained that even it the
Trustees favored renovation, part at
Mears may be razed. ”Admissions will
not need all of Mears. We have the op»
tion to either tear down the north wing
and rebuild the old wall or renovate it
along with the rest." The decision
would depend chieily on comparative
costs,

Further action is pending Weese's
conclusions, "We can't do much more
until we‘re certain oi the nature 01 the
project and how much it will cost,“ he
said. However, Drake did not specity
exactly when Weese would complete his

Government
at standstill

Energy conservation "within the
Federal government overall has been
at a complete standstill since 1976" and
the Department oi Energy "has in elr
iect adopted the policy that conserva
tion is good (or the people but not lor the
government," a Congressional subcom-
mittee has concluded.

A report by the House subcommittee
on Environment, Energy, and Natural
Resources said, "it‘ the Department of
Defense is excluded, comparison of
Federal energy use for the lirst Sl‘
months at fiscal year 1979, compared
to iiscal year 1975, shows an overall 2 i
percent increase in energy use of the
Federal government."

In comparison, private industry
reduced its consumption oi energy by 10
percent per unit oi production between
1974 and now, according to Federal
Reserve Board figures,

Subcommittee Chairman Toby Mol-
lett (D .CN) said in remarks attached

Drake suggests only too probable
outcomes. "It's strongly indicated that
Admisswns will move into Meal's. it the
Trustees decide to preserve it," he said.

Drake personally iavors restoration
"It's no secret that i am working to
save the building. It‘s important tor the
college to hang onto its 19th century
structures because we're rooted in the
19th century," he said.

Drake does not believe that the
Turstees are against preservation.
"They are open-minded about Mears
and are viilling to listen to constructive
ideas," he said.

Drake explained that even a
l‘avorahle Trustee response does not
guarantee preservation. The Trustees
may approve a funding drive and
postpone a linal decision, "What money
we can raise may then become the chlcl
lactor," Drake Said.
