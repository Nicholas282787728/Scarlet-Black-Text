Counci/
Corner

By Art Travers

It’s beginning to look as if
there is a rebirth of the old
college spirit on the campus.
With one day remaining till the
deadline, I’ve received a "dump-
er crop of petitions for class
office. Thirty—five, in fact. This
would, indeed, be gladdening
news, (it 1 were the type that
gladdened, so to speak) were
it not for the fact that only
two persons have applied for
positions on the Pep club. As
usual not one man has shown
any interest.

Now, I realize that pep is
a pretty unsophisticated qual-
ity. As a matter of fact, if
you read the New Yorker,
nap might appear to be down-
right primitive or quaint.
How droll, hnw cosmopolitan
to be unconcerned.

The only question of any im-
portance, however is this: About
what are you peppy? It seems
that the most apathetic specta»
tor at ball games can get en-
thused over something. It may
be Morris chair burning, or 3.2
or some such, but it is a rare
person who has no enthusiasm
ror anything.

The purpose of the Pep club
is to direct some of that en-
thusiasm into certain channels.
Admittedly, in the past it has
not performed that job with
any startling degree of success,
For that reason we have under~
taken to overhaul the Pep club.

We believe that these re-
visions Will take many of the
bugs out of the Pen club, but ,
we need good people to im-
plement these changes. with-
out these people we might as
well disband the Pep Club.
All this brings me to the real
point of all this verbiage. The
deadline tor applications for
Pep club office had been to-
morrow. I feel. however, that
in the rush of class elections
that this fact did not receive
its due notice. The deadline will
be Extended till Oct. 29. it
you're interested at all, please
submit an application.
