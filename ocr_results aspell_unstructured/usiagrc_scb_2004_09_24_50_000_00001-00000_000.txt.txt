Burglary on High Street

Credit cards and other items stolen from student’s room while he was asleep

BV BROOKE LANSDALE

For a group of five college students 1in
ing offrcampus, locking their door didn‘t
seem necessary, at least not when they were in
the house. But late Saturday night a thief or
thieves burglarized their offcampus, non-col-
lege owned house on High Street.

Charles Blake,Tony Harrison, Lindajohnr
son, Caroline Logan and Claire Odom, all class
of 2005, were all at home when the crime oc-
curred. Some person or persons entered their
house some point after 1 am. when they were
all in bed and took several items from their
home. The perpetrator entered through an
unlocked door and took items from their 1in
ing room and kitchen but did not go upstairs
where most of the bedrooms are located.

Harrison’s bedroom, which is located
downstairs, however, was entered: “They went
into Tony's room while he was sleeping and
took his stuffwhile he was there," said Logan.
Items taken included cigarettes, CD5, a tobac-
co pipe, Harrison's ATM Card and VISA card.
a photograph orlohnson's sister, and Logan's
checkbook.

Harrison called the police the next morn-
ing (0 report the crime. The ofﬁcer told Har-
rison to meet him on the front porch of his

house, but when he arrived Harrison was upset
to discover he did not intend to get out of the
police car. Harrison,who is on crutches, said,"I
was on the porch, crutches and all, and he said,
‘can you make it down here?m

The police officer did not come into their
house to take evidence, though he did collect
a stolen checkbook that the perpetrator had
dropped in their home. He suggested they call
the police station with any information they
attain on where their cards and checkbook are
usedi“They came over to ﬁle a report, and they
were not that helpful," said‘Johnson.

The officer who came to the students’
house is on vacation and was unavailable for
comment, but Grinnell Police Chief, Jody
Matherly, oileied an explanation as to why no
evidence was collected from the house. Aer
cording to Matherly, “If the scene has been
disturbed and nothing has been preserved, the
evtdcnce is no good." Because the students
had been in and out of their house since the
burglary, they would have “destroyed evidence
at that point," said Matlicrly, “We do: lift
evidence if there's no chance."Hc also sal the
Police Department is followtng leads in this
case which seems to be an isolated incident in
Grinnell.

To prevent this type of crime, Matherly
said to lock all doors and have outside lighting
on. “liyou see a suspicious person, call the per
lice,"said Mathcrly. "Be vigilant. When thieves
know they can be seen theywill not strike."

Matherly advises anyone who is burglar»
ized should call the police right away and not
disturb the scene: “Preserve evidence, like CS1
on TV. .. don't let anyone touch anything, don't
move anything. Physical evidence can be very
valuable in a case like this."

Matherly commented on the “trustworthy
type of atmosphere here," and said that resir
dential theft is not very common in the area,
though it does occur. “Burglaries of cars are
more common,”he said. “Often times they are
left unlocked and valuables are left in the cal."

Mctnbers or the community who know the
patterns of the pcople in their neighborhood
typically commit these burgl es and the po-
lice find very few cases orproi't. . ional thieves
coming in from out of town, Vthn asked if
strident houses were likelicr targets for but»
glai-y, Matheily saitl, “Absolutely not. Because
college kids keep oddcr hours and have many
roommates, they are not a good target."

Students
start pro-
life group

BY DAVlD MONTGOMERY

An attempt by a small group of students to
organize a pro—life group on campus generated
some tension on campus early this school year.
with some students defacing or ripping down
signs. Others, according to group cotleader
Cathy Geddes '07, attended the group’s first
meeting with the intention ofdisrupting it.

Co-leader Mary Nesbit ’07 criticized the
vandals. “I spent two hours making and put—
ting signs up around campus for our meeting.
To take them down and write on them is not
up to Glinnellian standards."

Despite the controversy, Nesbit and Ged-
des insist that they aren't trying to create bad
feelings. “We want to increase dialogue on
campus about this topic," Geddes said. some
things they plan on doing involve bringing
speakers from groups such as Feminists for
Life or Democrats for Life to campus in an
attempt to dispel “the stereotype that pro~lif~
ers are really conservative," said Geddes. The
group also hopes to arrange a debate between
a proelife Democrat and a pro-choice Repub-
lican.

While some Grinnellians have taken lST
sue with the pro-life group, Nesbit doesn't feel
that most students are opposed to the group’s
existence. “I dou’t think most Grinnelllans are
interested in this, but I think the majority are
cool with it," she said. “They can respect the
way we’re going about things."

The group was the brainchild of Nesbit
and former Grinnell student Laura Unsworth.
A preliminary meeting was held at the end or
the spring semester, and there was enough in-
terest that Nesbit went ahead with the group
this year. “We looked for leaders at the first
meeting, and found [Geddes]," explained Nesr
bit.

Pro-life Grinnellians are a very small mi—
nority on campus, admit Nesbit and Geddes,
but that was part of the impetus to start the
program. “We’re looking at building a sort of
support system for activists," explained Nesbit,
saying that the group hoped to provide a {0,
turn for those who might feel intimidated by
the prevalence otopinions differing from their
own.

“[Abortion] is pretty much a closed issue
on campus," said Nesbit. "In many ways, I feel
that Grinnell has almost no ideological diver-
sl .
tyWhether or not the group persuades any
one to be pro-life, their goal is to get the issue
on the table. “A lot orpeople are talking about
this," said chdes, “which is awesome—even
if they're saying bad things."

What Nesbit feels is most important is
that people not leap to judgment about the
prorllfe group, “I feel that [we] got judgcd in
its formative stages,” she said with regards to
thc vandalized signs and disrupted meeting.
“Just Come to a mceting, and see what we’re
about,"

The pro—life group meets on Friday arter-
noons at 4:30 in the Forum Coffeehouse.
