Saawariya
(2007)

Bollywood titilates, but

doesn’t satisfy audience

soioariya (“Beloved", in English), the first
film ever eoeproduced by Indian and American
production companies, transcends its genre.

Although Bollywood through and through,
taaozriya remains mercifully short in com-
parison to similar films and toys with a sur-
realism rarely seen in such pig-budget produc-
tions. For those unfamiliar with Dostoevsky's
“White Nights," the short story on which
Saawmiyri is based concerns the unrequited
love of a rnan chasing a betrothed woman.
That is as close to the original story Saawariya

stays the action is set not in Russia but in a .

fantasy world, and the characters are unrecogr
nieable from the original.

The entirety of soaaiariyo takes place in a
eity nightscapka mixture of noir New York
and Venice at its most opulcnr— but each and
every shot is full oflighr and color. Blue reps
resents darkness, not black, and the canals that
make up the city streets reflect and refract the
various greens, reds, and yellows of the city’s
bright lightsTo call the sets lavish doesn't do
thcm justice. The sets are otherworldly. The
ﬁlm claims to take place in a red light district,
but if brothels in the real world looked any
thing like they do in saawariya, palaces would
run cheap.

The characters themselves remain second
ary to the visuals and the romantic leads indie
cate emotions more than act them. It becomes
more and more obvious that they are merely
a part of the sets, too, as the movie goes on.
The dialogue runs from silly to downright
cringeeworthy, full ofPidgin English and half-
remembered platitudes.

The actors themselves, though, radiate
beauty. The camera reveals every aching curve
(while keeping it decidedly PG), and zooms in
rightup next to their faces so the audience can
savor every perfect feature. What conversation
there is serves mainly to facilitate the transit
tion from song to song,iather than to progress
the utterly static storyline.

The musical numbers arc the heating heart
of Saawmiya. Subtitles don’t do the beautiful
language justice; they are best left ofrtor the
whole movie (let's call this a personal note to
the projectionist in Harris this weekend). The
tunes, though not particularly memorable, ac-
centuate the dreamlike namre of Saawririya
and drip melancholy,

Soawonyn is nevertheless frustrating. The
characters live next to brothels. the plot rc-
volves around sex, and the camera work is sen-
sual to the point of eroticism, but the movie
offers no release.

Kisses are left undone, the romance remains
unfulfilled, and the dialogue remains madden»
ingly chaste.The action is slow and contrived.
driven more by whimsy than motivation, and
sunlight never graces the glittering sets. The

film has more in common with “The Tempest"‘

than with the “Romeo and Juliet"it tries to be.
it's beautiﬁll, but stuck in irrelevance.

lane for soonsmsbesdivorccd William Hayes,
as he tells his eighreycareold daughter Maya
(Abigail Bleslin) the story ofhow he met her

By that quick summary, the movie has all
the ingredients for a typical chick flick, our
there’s a catch- as he tells Maya about his ro-
mantic past and the three serious girlfriends
he had, each coming in and out of his life at
various points, he doesn’t reveal her mother's
identity. With the added bonus of having to
figure out who the mystery mother is, this
movie is true [0 its comedic nature with witty
oneeliners, just plain awkward situations that
make you want to laugh and cringe, and the
hilarious moments where Maya’s innocence
collides with parts of Will’s story that are
clearly not meant for cight-ycar-old cars.

Also peppered throughout the movie are

Vantage Point
(2 008)

Film’s attempts at rel—
evance falls flat

Are you in the mood for a thought provok—
ing and politically savvy film? Ifso, you mighr
think that Vim/age Pain! would fit the bill,
hased on its previews and surplus of solid ac-
tors (Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox,and Dene
nis Quid, to name a few). In fact, the movie
remains about as far from thought provoking
as you cau get and simply wallows in its own
incomprehensibility and self-righteousness.

The premise of Vantage Point seems pie?
ty simple. The fictional American President
Ashton arrives in Salamanca, spain to speak
at an antirterrorism summit. Right before he
speaks, he is shot by an unknown assassinThe
crowd scmnibles. Secret Service agents chase
after a suspect. A reporter cries. A bomb goes
off And Forrest Whitaker's character, toting a
handheld camera, rapes the chaos,

But that's not all folks. The film follows a

nonrlincar plot line in an attempt to hide the
obvious flaws in the script and direction ofthe
film by. making it seem more artistic. such a
technique doesn’t serve the story, which re
mains boring.

Besides the confusing narrarive, the main
problem with this ﬁlm is its pretentious po-
litical commentary. The ﬁlmmakers think that
they are making an insightful parallel to the
Bush Administration when they show summit
protesters holding up “No blood for oil,” and
“[Ptesident Ashton] World's # l'Tcrrorist,"
signsTo reduce the complexities ofthc War in
Iraq and Global Terror to a few catchphrases
is not only insulting to the viewer but also too
lightly pokes fun at serious problems. How—
ever, rhe idiocy of the film doesn't just stop at
a few signs.

There arc terrorists everywherel Morocco
is harboring some, and right in salamanca,
there are ﬁve of them after President Ashton’s
life. But we don't care about any of these chart
aetcrs because there is no background on the
political situation of Vim/age Point's fictional
world. The only reference to the real world,
other than the signs and the mention of rerr
music, is when Matthew Fox’s character says,
“This war will never cnd."Is this an allusion to
the War on Terror, the War in Iraq, or the war
on Christmas? We’ll never know.

Van/age Paint is not just bad. It’s an excrin
ciating experience that only mindless action
junkics could enjoy, Sure, there are some thrills,
some twists, and some turns. But they are not
tor the sake of political commentary; they are
for the sake of cal crashes, chases, bullets, and
body counts.
