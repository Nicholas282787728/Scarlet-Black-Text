ABOUT A year ago. at the instir
gation at our librarian. a move
ment “as set on foot to light the
library so that access toil might
be had in the evening, by those
who so desired This is no longer
an experiment, it is a fact and all
credit to our lihraiiun who inslir
gated the movement, That it
was a long felt want is evinced _by
the large number who take ad
vantage of the opportunity. The
need had long been tell, but no
one had ever undertaken to push
the plan to completion. Thus
other improvements might be
made it we had some one suFﬁ-
ciently interested to push the
cause along.

IN A shorttin-ie the annual home
oratorical contest will be held,
and again we are tourid in the
same predicament which has cons
tronted us in tormer years. our
facilities for excellence in this
line of work are not what we
would wish them to her Each
succeeding year ﬁnds us in the
same dilemma. We regret the tact
that aspirants in this line oi work
do not have the assistance of an
instructor in oratory at their Com~
mand. That the college has not
raised its standard in this line, to-

gethei with othei advances is
plainly evident from the condition
of the society work, No one
will deny that we have the
material; we lack the faculty of
developing it, and this can be
done only by the aid or an efﬁr
cieut instructot, That our plight
will.not ever be such, is the hope
oi all interested in the work of
the literary societies.

IT is not due to a lack of talent.
nor to a lack at students that
there is but one men’s society in
the Academy. This deplorable
fact is due to a lack of interest.
Barely one fourth ot the Academy
men belong to a literary society
and this is not as it should be. It
is evident that something should
be done, and done at once.
it we do not intend to con-
tinue our failures in our literary
contests with other schools. One
or the most conspicuous things in
this institution is the general
absence of an interest in society
work. This applies, to a certain
extent, to the college, but more
particularly to the Academy. An
interest should be aroused es»
pccially in the Academy. Just as
the Academy prepares tor the
college, so the Academy societies
should prepare tor those in the
college. The beneﬁt derived
from society work isvery valuable,
for unlike common College or
Academy work, it artords Oppor-
tunity to cultivate freedom or
speech, and originality of thought.
which are very essential elements
of an education The literary
enthusiasm is not keeping pace
with the college. Can we not
now, divert our Athletic cnthusir
asm into the channel of society
work.
