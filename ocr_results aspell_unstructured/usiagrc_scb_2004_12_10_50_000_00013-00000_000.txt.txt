Go away Super Wal-Mart

There's a smorgasbord ofrcasons why WalrMart is a big, evil, rice
good corponuion. The Largest employer in Lhc us, WriHMart vinr
lently opposes unionizau'on. It sclls clothing made by child labor and
under hazardous sweat—
shop conditions Wale
Man is hung the largest
employment-discrimi-
nation case over brought
against it private emv
ployur, for systematically
discriminating against
1.6 million women in pay, promotion and job assignments. 77w Nero
Yer-k Timer ran an expose on th-Mart forcing workers to work othhc
clock and even, literally; locking them into the store. VVal-Mnlt sells
guns, but censors music, and has reportedly contributed more to Bush
than any other company.

What's not to hate? Unfominately, despite its litany of evils,Walr
Mart seduces us in nplnce even more persuasive than our sociallv cone
scious hearts: our pocketbooks Funherrnorc,‘ in Grinnell there aren’t
many (or, in the case of some products, any) altenialive retailers, and
many of rrs don't have easy transportation to stores outside Grinnell.
No matter how rabidly suicirWaHVInrt we nrc, very few of us haven't
bought something at the biggest ofbig boxes.

Many students respond to the potential opening of a Super Wal-
Mart across from the current Wal-Mart with a shrug of resignation.
After all, Grinnell already has a Wul—Murt, and, frankly, there aren‘t
that many other regular businesses left many have already closed. But
the greater opportunity for one stop shopping at a Super Wal Mart
with a ccerysccnon, a pharmacy and otpnndcd mendiandisr would
still signiﬁcantly harm a nrunber of Grinnells businesses, induding
Brown’s Shoe Fit, Bikes To You, Dollar General and Act Hardwareg,
as well as the grocery stores, implement stores and portrait studios.
For those who see it as more “local" to shop at a Super Walsh/[art in
Grinnell than in Newton, remember that, though sales tax may stay
in Grinnell, proﬁts immediately go beds to Bentonville,A.rk In New
Paltz, New York, the city planning board found that bringing at Super
Wal-Mart to their community would actually cost the city 313,000 a
year, because it would cost more in municipal services and other rev-
enue losses than it pay in taxes.

others nrgue that WalrMnrt's cheap prices beneﬁt the least privir
leged members ofour community However. WalrMart has the mass
sive capital necessary to slash prices until it drives competitors out of
business, but than frequently raises its prices far above Competitive
levels.

At this point, it doesn't look like the city council has much leeway
to turn down the annotation of the land on which a Super Wﬂ’Maﬂ
may be build. After annexation, the city chooses how to zone the land;
however, if it isn’t zoned commercial, the city may ﬁrce a lawsuit chal-
lenging its grounds for doing so. opponents ofa Super Wal—Mart in
Grinnell have called for a six»month moratorium on buildings over
50,000 square feet, during which the city can conduct an economic
impact studywhich might provide reason to zone the land nonrcomr
mercialWhethcr or not a Super Wal—Marr opens in Gnnnell, we urge
students to devote as few as possible of their (or their parents’) hard-
earned dollars to the biggest corpomtion in the world. some products
in Grinnell are only found in Wal-Mart, but many of the products
students regularly buy can be found at Dollar Genenll.HyVee or other
Grinnell retailers. Local businesses give back to me community in
ways other than simply providing consumer produco.They buy year
book ads and support high schoolsports teams. And they provide jobs
with healthcare that covers birth control. And national studies show
that for everyjob gained through Wal—Mart, 1.3 to 1.5 jobs are lost.

When it comes to WalrMarr, our favorite little @ﬁrmmer of liberal
light,“The Daily Show's"]on Stewart, might have said it besr."’1'hey
don't do it [or the money," he said. “They do it to ruin your town.”A

we must oppose WalrMart and its plan to build a Super Wal-Mart
in Grinnell.

Letters to the Editor

 

Coke's response misleading

As a studcnt group working on
the campaign against Coca-Cola on
campus, we arc concerned that the late
rcr to the editor from the COCXI’Colﬂ
Company pruned in the Sis’B re ‘cr
scnlcd an effort to whitewash actions
by Coke and contained a number of
misleading lfnot outright fucruully ins
correct statements

Thcinternationalcampaignagainst
Coke is primarily focused on Colomr
bin, where nine Coca-Cola union or-
ganizers have been murdered over the
last decade. Coke attempts to defend
their reputation by arguing that their
company is fricndly to unions and has
collective bargaining agreements with
a number ofunions in the country. A
look at the record reveals otherwise: as
reported in the New
York City Council's
independent invesv
tigative report, from
1992 to 2002 some
6,700 Cocanoln
workers in COIOITF
bia lost their jobs.
Eighty-eight per
cent of the Compm
ny’s workers are now
temporary workers and not union-
ized. Wages have been reduced by 35
percent for those temporary work
ers in the last decade, and they make
one-fourth what union workers earn.
Temp workers have no job security,
no health insurance and no right to
organize. The company has contian
ally pressured workers to resign their
union membership and their contrac—
tual guarantees, and a number ofcoke
workers have reported being fired for
attending union meetings. The union
representing the largest number Coca-
Cola workers, SINALTRAINAL, or-
ganizcd thc intcmational campaign
ngninst Coke in response to violence
and intimidation against its members.

Luis Cardona, a union argunizer
from Colombia who recently spokc
nt Grinncll. described 11 particularly
chilling episode he witnessed where,
two days after fellow union organizer
Isidro Gil was assassinated inside the
Bebidns y Alimenlos bottling plant,
paramiliturres entered the plant and
gave workers the option or either re-
signmg from the union or sharing the
fare of their colleague Gil. The prime
militaries then proceeded to direct the
workers into the plant manager's office
to sign union resignation forms.

Colombia.

To dismiss this as an
attentiongrabbing
ploy is to deny the
very real tragedies
experienced by Coca-
Cola workers in

While Coke argues that they have
been exonerated by Colombian courts,
the record of these courts in llil’BStr
gating and prosecuting the killers of
union organizers is notoriously poor.
As the U 5. slate Department points
out, impunity for human rights abuses
remnms the greatest human rights
problem in Colombia, and out of more
than 4,000 cases of trade union nssns-
sinmions in Colombia, only sw have
been successfully prosecuted by govV
crnmcnt authorities.

Coke claims that an independent
investigation found no evidence of
human rights violations. As far as we
can tell, however, there is no public
information available regarding any
independent investigation undertaken

by CocarCola. In—
stead, the Washing-
ton Post reports that
CocrrCola's general
counsel, Deval Pate
rick, resigned in part
because the manage
ment refused to ant
thorize an indepelr
dent investigation.
The only indepen-
dent investigation we know ofgled
hy the New York City Counciliconr
cludcd, based on interviews with mans
agcrs, workers, and union organizers,
that “Coca-Cola is complicit in the
human rights abuses of its workers in
Colombia."

Coke also points out that they pmr
vide their employees as much protec
tion as possible in what is undeniably a
dangerous country. Certainly, operat-
ing a major business in a country like
Colombia carries known risks. One
would hope that Coca—Cola would
make at least basic, remedial efforts
to protect workers from abuse. At the
very least, one would hope Coca-Cola
and its business partners would not no
tively encourage violence against trade
unionists, th, evidence suggests that
collusion between Cocanola plant
managers and paramilitary leaders is
widespread and ongoing. Within the
past year, workers have reported wit-
nessing meetings between CocaeCola
plant mangers and paramilitary lenders,
There is documentation that at least
one Coca-Cola plant manager was
making monthly payments, as March
of 2003, to paramilitary lenders. Para-
military leaders recently boasted to a
National Public Radio reporter that

that llrcy maintain bases at all of tho
CocurCola bottling facrlities in Co—
lombia in order to ‘protect them.’

There are also documented instanc’
es in which Cocanola and its agents,
in the fact of credible threats, appear
to have declined to take even the most
minimal precautions to protect work-
ers. In the case of Isidro Gil, union
ofﬁcials warned CocarCola of threats
of vlolcncc several months before Gil
was murdered inside the factory com-
pound. However, the union‘s pleas for
ussistance were apparently denied or
ignoredThe fact that the murders and
intimidation have taken place over a
number of years , more than a decade
7 indicates further that the Coca-Cola
Company has not acted adequately to
ensure workers'safrry,

Finally, Coke has the audacity to
smugly suggest that our campaign is
rooted in some misguided desire for
publicity. The international campaign
was organized and spearheaded by
SINALTRAINAL. the union reprer
scoring Colombia's CocarColu work
ers, and has since been championed
by human rights advocates in the US.
and worldwide. These workers and
advocates speak out at great risk to
their personal safety and that of their
families. In August of 2002, Adolfo
de Jesus Munera, whose case ngainst
Coca»Cola had just been accepted by
Colombia's Constimrional Court, was
murdered at his mother's doorsteps by
an unknown gunman. In 2000, have
ing murdered Isidro Gil several years
before, the paramilitaries returned to
murder his wife, who provided ins
formation for the case, leaving their
children without parents. To dismiss
this as an attention-grabbing ploy is
to deny the very real tragedies expe-
rienced by Cocanola workers in Cor
lombiu and their families.

In light of Coke's ongoing refusal
to seriously deal with human rights
violations against their workers, the
Griiincll college community has de-
cided to officially boycott CocurCola,
and we will push fora switch to more
socially responsible alternatives when
the contract comes up for renewal in

2008.

The tuition dilemma

1f tuition increases 6.5 percent annually for 11
years, the price will double to $65,000. Such a series
of hikes may appear implausable, but no more so than
expecting college tuitions to plateau soon. First, despite
the occasional whimper, students nre largely indifferent
to price, as was evident when, recently, fewer than three
percent of students attended a well-advertised forum
on tuition.

Secondly, ballooning demand—expressed by ap-
plications—gives the college no incentive to cut costs.
Students remain indirferent and applications are his
creasing because everyone is obsessed with the status
(real or imagined) that a degree from a top institution
confers upon its graduates. Many oollegcs that are not
elite, per se, offer ﬁne educations. But as long as pro-
spective and current students are unwilling to even
consider not attending an “elite” college, tuition will
continue to rise, and students and parents will take it
because they’ve asked for it.

Christmas is wonderful

In last weeks 588,1 made public some opin-
ions about the Christmas holiday Since the publi—
cation of that issue, attorneys of Mr. S. Claus have
contacted me, and on the advice ofrny own counsel,
Iwould like to issue a full retraction.

Christmas is a wonderful holiday that should
be celebrated to the ﬁlllesr extent allowable under
the law, including but not limited to garish displays
of Christmas lights, big Christ-mas trees, boisterous
singing cfcarols, and planting giant plastic reindeer
in die front lawn. Those who do not join in the
holiday revelry are menaces to society and need to
be confronted directly lest our way of life become
corrupted It was never my intention to encourage
deviancy from a proud American tradition, and I
apologize to those who i may have led astray Merry
Christ-mas.
