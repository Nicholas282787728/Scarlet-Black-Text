THE HOME CONCERT.

After alternate pouts and smiles
all day. nature settled down to a
neutral gray last evening, and al»
lowed the music lovers to don
their gayest attire in deierence to
the social event of the season.
the annual Orchestra-Glee Club
concert.

And it was an event, from not
only a social. but an artistic stand
point. The public has come to
expect much from the annual
showing of these two musical or-
ganizations. and they were in no
wise disappointed last evening.

The Amplrion Orchestra corr-
sists of twenty-seven performers.
as against twenty-two last year.

‘ The general effect is greatly im-
proved by the addition ot the
oboe. the oasson and the kettle
drums. Throughout the evening
they played with a ﬁrmness and
precision which attested well their
caleful training. At no time did
theirplayingsinkto-themediocre;
on the contrary their broad inter-r
pretations demonstrated clearly
the artistic instinct of their con-
scientious leader, as well as their
own marked ability.

The Glee Club, nineteen strong.
resumed at once their old time
place in the hearts of the auditors.
They are always prime tavorrtes
with the students, and last even-
ing. as usual, they evoked admira-
tion and vociferous applause by
the ﬁnished rendition of their
numbers. Their improvement.
under theleadcrship of Mr. Cole,
is as marked as in past years In
distinctness of utterance, in unani-
mity of attack. and in the deft
handling of crescendos and di-
minuendos as the themes were
bandied about from tenor to bass,
they were well nigh irreproach-
able.

The audience cxpressed itself
very vigorously in its applause,
and the programme ot twelve
numbers was lengthened to twen-
tyeeight by the recalls.

The Fest Overture and the
Funeral March of a Mariollet
were particularly well rendered
by the orchestra, and Mr. ‘Ken-
dall, in the Russian Fantasie, gave
forth such dulcet tones from his
cornet,that he was obliged to
yield ‘to the clamors of the
audience for more.

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL.

 

The interest in the Glee Club
songs was greatly enhanced by
the two Iowa College songs,
“Our College is Our Castle,” and
“The Scarlet and Black.” "The
Young Lover." “Over the Way,"
and “Black Sheep" appealed to
the musical taste by their melod-
iousuess. as well as by their ﬁtlisll~
ed rendition. special mention
should be made also of the solos
by Messrs. Gray. Parish and Rus-
sell, which wcre made more en-
joyable by being spoken so clear-
ly; and also of the yodeling oi
Mr. Pierce, which was one of the
pleasantest features ot the even-
mg.

The Proposed Honor System.

[CuiniuuulcntlniLl
Perhaps there are some consid-
erations which may well be
weighed betore we enter upon the
proposed “Honor" system.
Granting for the present that
there is a large amount of un»
necessary “flogging” and that
something ought to be done to
lessen the evil, the whole question
is concerning the nattlre of the
“something." .

1n the ﬁrst place it would seem
that the only rational object which
we can be seeking is the elevation
of the moral sentiment of the
body of the students against the
evil thing among rrs. It this be
granted. then it follows that we
have before us largely a question
of means or expediency. What
is the best way to accomplish the
result desired? Those who favor
the proposed plan afﬁrm it will be
the best as well as most expedie
ent method.

But it is right here that one ime
portant reflection is not made by
many who have given this subject
little thought. Suppose we grant
that you are presenting us a good
system,cvcn a faulllcss one. We
may even have a plan born in
heaven and committed to the im-
mediate direction ot an archangel,
ya! ya {it Mimi/rd [a cor [mitt/mm
of [rye it will fail [a accomplis/t [/12
adja't ticsz'gwa’. This tundanrental
truth has been proven over and
over again in the history at the
governments of the world.

We need to remember that this
plan in general is used in large in
stitutions where the classes aggre
gate trom one hundred to two
hundred or more students. These
institutions also. approach the tini-
versity grade much more nearly
than we. Again, such a plan will
not work unless it meets the
hearty co-opclation or' all stue
dents. No system of government
can long survive that does not
rest upon the will or the people
and call forth their energies to
beneﬁt its objects. There is a
large and increasing nrrmbcr- or
