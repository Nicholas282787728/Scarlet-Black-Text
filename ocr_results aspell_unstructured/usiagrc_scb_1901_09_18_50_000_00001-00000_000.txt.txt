The Work otthe School of Music.

The college music school is dis-
tinctively a western institution,
It is. on the one hand, an effort to
provide a nucleus for the scatter
ed musical activities of a dispersed
population, and on the other hand
it is a natural and easily under»
stood outgrowth of the coeduca-
tionalsystem. Womenareincline
ed to the study ot music to a
much greater extent than man.
Even in Grinnell. where the pro-
portion of men studying music is
unusually large, the women in the
School of Music outnumber the
men fourto one. A college there-
fore. which offers its advantages
to women, must make some pros
vision tor the musical tendency of
the feminine portion or its con
stituency. Merely theoretical
coursesinthe history and aesthetic
ot music, such as might properly
be included in the curriculum of
any college, must he supplement-
ed in a school of this character by
masterly instruction in pianoiorte,
singing, and other branches ot
practical music. For many of its
students it must offer courses
which will give thorough prepara
tion for the career of a music
teacher. Others come to it to lay
the toundation tor subsequent

 

study, looking forward to an ar»
tistic career. and others, still, take
couises in music for the sake oi
the delight which they have iti
them.

The School of Music of Iowa
College endeavors to accomodatc
every musically inclined person.
whatever the tlegreeot his inclina-
tion maybe. Fitted with its di-
ploma, a man or woman can go in-
to the music world as a teacher.
wellrequipped and \l'cllscndorsed.
or a student in Iowa College, de-
siring a broad view oi the develop-
ment of niusrc or a closer study of
any of its branches. will ﬁnd that
he can pursue such study with real
proﬁt to the rest of his work, In
addition to the courses already of-
feied in the school, it is intended
to offer very soon a special course
in public school music, for persons
who wish to teach ' in the
schools exclusively. and also for
those who need it in addition to
their other work. A course in
church music, tor organists and
ehoirniasters, is also in considera.
tion, and only awaits the neces-
sary facilities to be realized. The
iaculty of the school have opened
negotiations {or a number of re
citals by eminent artists to be gi .
en through the year, and deﬁnite
announcements in this direction
may be expected soon.

The incidental advantages of
the school are manifold, and it is
a thing fervently to be desired
that none of the musical organir
zations for which Griniiell is fa~
inous should languish, The Glee
Club, the Orchestra. the Euterpe
Club and the Mtlstc Literary so.
ciety, are all organizations
which it is worth any student's
while to take part actively. In
addition to these. it is planned
to make the choir of the Congrer
gational church a musical organ-
izationofconsiderableimportance,
efﬁcient to an extent not hitherto
realized, and at the same time, by
the use of a large chorus, to throw
open its advantage even to those
who have a mlntmum of musical
knowledge.

The outlook for the School of
Music is emphatically most ens
couraging along every line. Tlic
number of students already en»
rolled indicates an increase over
last year's attendance. There is

in

 

a good proportion ot advanced
, and the number oi stu~
dents taking full work seems to be
increasing. The theory courses.
which may ultimately he taken
as an index ota conscrvatory’s
prosperity. are growing more
popular. The requirements for
graduation will be strengthened
along these lines in the near tu-
ture, as nothing gives a musician
better grasp of his work. in what
ever line it may lie. than theoretr
ical study.

The School has a large ﬁeld to
draw from with comparatively
little competition. What it needs
just now, more than anything else,
is the enthusiastic support of the
students, not only in Grinnell, but
also in their home towns. in in-
ﬂuencing others to come here for
their musical study. The School
is ready for systematic, aggressive
work, and, with two or three
years' of sustained effort, it pres-
ent indications are to be inter-
preted correctly, should hold an
undisputed position among the
music schools of the West.
