Minority desire for separate houses
only fair, not a call for segregation

OR the pastcouple ofmontlis,
Fthe Latino, Asian, interna

tienal and Jewish students on
campus have been rallying to get
their own houses.

I told some people what I was
writing my column about this week
and all I heard were groans. They
asked me why I was beating a dead
horse; people were tired oi hearing
about this issue. Iain writing about
this issue because 1 think it is impair
tant that these students receive sup
port iroin somewhere Some people
attack them because they say that
these students are only trying to segr
l'eaatetheitiselvcs fromthcrestol'tlie
e npus That is outiageous These
students of color only want a place
where they can come together with
others from their own culture and
celebialc, That is a liatd thing to do,
without a house, on a campus where
the majority of studeitts are white
Americans.

lwas having an argument wtth a
man on my hear and he was com-
platning about how students ol’eolor
wanting thcitown houses was wrong
because it would separate the stun
dents and then they would only be
segregating themselves from the rest
ofthe campus.

I told him to put himselfin our
place I asked him what he would do
if he went to a school which was
predominantlyblack,LatinoorAsian.
He got the point, I am notsaying that
thestudentsofeolorareanydifferent
from the white students, but a lot of
the time they might have different
interests This campus is geared to—

like the Black Cultural Center, the

BREAKING ITS PROMISE

Grinnell doesn’t live up to its promises as a
“liberal" institution. See guest editorial page 9

Professors shouldn’t be aﬁaid
to lecture, share knowledge

By RHYS JONES

Contributor

THERE is a growing trend at Grinnell (and, most likely, at liberal

 

arts schools across the country) to bring class discussion to the

forcfront, which at best emphasizes active student involvement
with material, but in many cases essentially eliminates the professor from
the educational process. The students have, like the proverbial inmates
who run the asylum, taken control ot’ the classroom. deciding not only the
daily agenda, but also the meaning, validity and points or reference
associated with the material “taught." Lectuting, previously the staple of
a college student’s diet, has become a rare delicacy to be savored as one
would caviar, '

We pay approximately 521,000 a year to attend what is supposedly one
of the finest academic institutions in the nation, We come to the middle
of Iowa for a single purpose: to learn that which we do not know. To be
more specific, we come to be TAUGHT that which we do not know by
people who do.

drunkcollegestudentswhohave pre
sumably made the commitment to
higher education and wish to team
from those more educated than cure
selves,

We are here to be exposed to a world of thought and learning
stretching above and beyond our previous individual and isolated expe—
rience, consisting of the sum and total knowledge of humanity. Ideally
we will recognize, appreciate and learn the thoughts of others so that we
may prepare to offer our own contributions. In the meantime, we are only
undergraduates who have much to learn.

And indeed, professors heraldraw a healthy salary for one express
purpose; to guide us through the bewildering forests of academia. They
have spent upwards oteight years in graduate school, focusing intensely
upon their chosen fields They have read many texts, both secondary and
source, and in many cases published their ﬁndings. They have earned
M.A.'s, Ph.D’s, and in some cases, double Ph,D's. Most impressively,
they are employed.

It is therefore unthinkable that the educator should be put into the role
of note-take and roomrwatcliei'. While the development ofsharp analyti-
cal skills is certainly on everyone‘s mind, let us not forget that the beneﬁt
ofa few hours of lecturing a week is almost sure to outweigh the serious
risks. As debilitating a condition as disuse of the vocal cords may be, it
is one I would gladly undertake in exchange for a professor’s concise
expression ofthe current and historical viewpoints on a course’s subject
matter.

Professors and Associates everywhere, know that “lecturing" is not a
dirty word. Cease the constant qualiﬁcation heard at the start of every
semester: “Don’t worry, this won't be a lecture course." Know that we
are rational beings able to separate your opinions (and the presented
opinions ofoihers) from our own, and that we will not hesitate to disagree
with you when the time is right. But most importantly, know that there
is a generation of students who long for perspective and guidance in the
form of that dying art, the lecture.

Aﬁenhoughi: This is only an editorial. Any resemblance to my current

professors is unintenLional and purely coincidental. Please don’t ﬂunk me.
