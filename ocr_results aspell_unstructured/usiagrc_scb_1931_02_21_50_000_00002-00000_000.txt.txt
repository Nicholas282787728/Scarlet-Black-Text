HONOR G FORMALITY
Grinncll college’s Honor G club. a leading
group on the campus for a score of years, has at
last taken its plllcc ofﬁcially as an organization.
Ofﬁccrs tllis \‘cor deserve commendation for their
work in fo lung .3 col titution and bylaws for tile
athletes. This constitution will do much to keep
the place of the Hollor G club as n campus leader.

With the constitution and bylaws came a
change ill initiation which is particulo ‘ welcome.
Instead of the former initiation which was colli-
pletely informal. new members are now gl‘ n a
Short and light informal session, following w h on
impressive ritual is followed through in making
them members. The signiﬁcance of the pin. of the
Scarlet sweater, and of the membership is fully in}
pressed upon newcomers in the organization.

Athletes are no longer expected to become
members ofthe group autolnaticr lly. Once they have
won their sweaters, they are asked to join. Mem-
bership is to remain I}. matter of choice. They may
receive their sweaters. but not their pins, if they
care to remain out of the club.

The change was difﬁcult to make, as is any
change which breaks from tradition. Both officers
and members saw the need for a revision. however,
and had the courage to take the necessary steps.
Student and faculty oppl'ovlll backs the Honor G
wholchelmedly ill this move.

PREPARATION FOR THE BALL

Grinncll college traditions are dear, and one
of the lovliest is the Colonial hall, given every yerlr
by the VVon'len’S Athletic association. Once more
each Grinnell woman will play the part of Martha
or George and dance the steps of long ago, for to-
night is the annual ball. .

But lovely as traditions such as this one are.
they usually mean that someone has spent a good
deal of time and thought planning and preparing
for them. In this case the “LILA. board has formed
itself into a committee in charge of the Colonial
hall. Members havc mode elaborate decorations to
transform the gymnasium into the interior of an
old-fashioned mansion.

As the feature of the evening. the women of
the board and 3 SS Clara J. Andersen will dance
the minuet. which is customary each year.

The Scarlet. and Block wishes to xprcss its
appreciation to those who are responsible for the
ball tonight for continuing so lovely a tradition of
Grillnell.

IS CHAIN NEWS ADEQUATE?

Journalism students at Grinnell college have
heard Hcrschcl M. Colbert. head of the department
of journalism, talk on the advantages of grollp and
chitin newspapers several times this ycztr. Without
doubt Mr. Colbert is ill stop with the trend ‘of
modern journalism. Tltc merging of larger dailies
and the group organization of Small papers are

proving more successful every (lily.

This week Waterloo joined the ranks of Town
cities with daily newspapers under a single owner-
ship. Dos Moillcs, Davenport, Cedar Rapids, Counml
Bluffs, Duhuquc, Mason City. Fort Dodge: Clinton,
Ottumwa, and Morsholltown preceded that city in
acknowledging service of o singlc‘popcr, or com-
bined papers under single ownership.

Tllc benefits of the mergers lie with the owners,
of course. Advertisers, if they wish to get thcll'
products before the public, ttrc forced to accede to
the demands of the advertising staff of the paper,
however unreasonable they mzty be.

Renders, too, stiffer, for thcir choice of news
source and editorial is limited. The Waterloo inorg-
cr is particularly Signiﬁcant on this score, Since
the passing of the Tribune ill that city marks the
end of morning newspaper Service in northeastern
Iowa, aside from the Des Moincs Register, which
can scarcely give adequate detailed coverage.

ONE FLUNK, TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS
(From the Daily Northwestern)

Grapevine telegraph brings news of the proposal
on the part of one of our large universities to require
students to pay a fee of $25 for every course in which
they ﬂunk. Whether this proposal embodies a good idea.
or not, it is certain that it presents a remarkable one.

The motive is obvious. Too many students do not
take their education seriously because they do not think
of it in terms of dollars land cents. Make them pay for
poor scholastic work and they will have a tangible
reason for not letting their studies lapse. Undoubtedly
the plan would decrease the number or students who
replarly fail one or more courses. . . .

There would be another lay-product of this proposal.
if it is Carried out. Students worried about the he-
cessity of paying $25 for dunking would feel obliged
to perfect new and better means of cribbing until that
venerable art would attain to heights unprecedented in
the history of education.

_G-
CAMPUS MORONS
('From the Beloit Round Table)

some of our students have a mania for collecting
room decorations. Most college men and women ply
this trade to some extent, but seldom is it found so
vicious as at the present time.

The overwhelming desire to get signs has led the
competing interior decorators to be rude enough to
hamper advertising programs of some of our campus
organizations. Several groups have complained about
having the posters on the bulletin board removed long
before the event advertised had happened. This is a
handicap on any activity, especially after time and
money have been expended to put up an attractive
poster.

It is hard to place the blame on any one group, but
evidence is pointing towards the freshmen. At the
dormitory party, the decorations were gone early in the
evening, the orchestra raided at the end by those de-
siring the few hearts on the background, and one over»
zealous youth climbed out on the north basket. to remove
a red heart that will new cover his barren walls.

An appeal to respect the efforts of fellow stu-
dents may bring the souvenir hunters to consciousness.
Perhaps the old sophomore council did serve a purpose
in the discipline that the newcomers lack in their home
training.

Steiner Article Printed
in Sunday School Paper
on American Citizenship

An article entitled “The romance
and reality of American citizenship,"
written by Dr. Edward A. Steiner,
professor of applied Christianity at
Griunell college, appeared in the Feb.
7 issue of “The Classmate," a Sun»
day school paper for young people.

Dr. Steiner explains what has made
him an American, and what sort of
an American he has become. He
points out that as America grows
greater in size, in power, and in
wealth, citizens must be willing to
pay the price to keep the nation fine, .
that it 'may gain the respect of all
the people of the world.

The article was written while Pro-
fessor Steiner was in Central Europe
this summer visiting his old home in
Czechoslovakia.
