Cool Hand Luke

by Brian Strause

“I don’t care ii it rains or
ireezes/long as I' got my plastic
Jasus/sittin’ on die dashboard or
my can..." sings Luke shortly
after he learns oi his mother's
death or course, Luke tPaul
Mewmanl takes about the same
amount oi stock in the teachings oi
the Lord as he holds respect ior
parking meters. (As a conse
quence, he is in prison {or the
crime oi knocking the tops oii oi
parking meters.)

As Luke acclimates himseli to
liie behind bars, he gains respect
irom his iellow inmates At iirst
Luke is so cool and tough that not
even the sadistic, ball-breaking
guards can harness his sense oi in-

dividualism. Aiter a sequence oi
attempted escapes, he gains fur-
ther prestige irom the other con-
victs; but in the eyes oi the
stereotypical guard, Luke has
pushed his luck a little bit too tar
and has set himseli iip ior certain
misery. To dispel any notion that
Luke is the hero his peers perceive
him to be. the guards take no mers
cy on Luke and leave him grovel-
ing at their ieet. 0i course, the
other prisoners don’t look kindly at
the defeated Luke and quickly igr
nore his existence.

Hallelujahl The holy Luke
manages to redeem himseli as he
steals a truck irom under the noses
oi the guards and speeds oil to

freedom. Luke is again a hero in
the eyes of his ﬁckle worshipers.
Luke is constantly shown in the
light oi Christian symbolism.
whether by challenging the indilr
ference of God in an abandoned
church or lying battered in a
cruciiix pose. To see Luke as a
legend. let alone a religious iigure.
is barely plausible and would cer-
tainly be absurd were it not ior
Paul Newman’s ability to wear
chains with a sense oi dignity and
sell»satislaction that gives ”coolH
a new meaning.

Duck Soup .

by Brian Strause

ii you have never seen a Marx
Brothers film in your life, “Duck
Soup" may warrant the occupation
oi your time. The Marx Brothers
ridicule diplomatic conierences
and climactic chase scenﬁ in a ﬁlm
that serves (perhaps uninten-
tionally) as a satire on the mean
sistencies oi governmental pro
cess.

Graucho plays Rufus T. Fireﬂy,

the Prime Minister of Freedonia, a
iictional Balkan country. Zeppo
aids Groucho as his secretary.
Harpo and Chico not only occupy
cabinet positions but also
moonlight as spies tor the enemy.

The humor or “Duck Soup” is
based on one-liners and puns.
When the state brings Chico to trial
for treason. the prosecutor
declares, “We'll have to eliminate

The Grinnell College Depart-
ment oi Theater opens its 1937“
season with Lillian Hellman's
”The Children's Hour,” a gripping
drama that demonstrates just how
much damage a child‘s he can do
to people's reputations, careers,
and personal lives, The trouble
begins in a girls' boarding school,
where the naughty, spoiled Mary
Tiliord, angry at the tact that she
cannot do whatever she wants as
she can at home, tells her doting
grandmother a “rumor" that her
teachers, Miss Karen Wright and
Miss Martha Dobie are having an

relationship. The grandmother, in
good iaith, believes her and
through her inﬂuence causes the
school to be closed and Karen and
Martha to lose their jobs. Matters
are lurther complicated when

troublesome former actress, Mrs.

No, Scruffy is rock and roll in the
proud tradition oi Chuck Berry,
Buddy Holly and. . NO. you might
not know it, but Scrutty the Cat is
the next big 7 N0! Look, I've
never seen Scruffy the Cat live.
I've heard from friends that they
are great live, the best band in
Boston. I've read raves calling
them wonderful and “the next big
thing.” I’ve listened to their record
a couple times and it moves. t

‘Diner" is an honest portrayal oi
the relationship of (we post-
college, not-quite-readyrl'orrther
realworld guys who hang out at
the Fells Point Diner in 1959
Baltimore. “Diner ' draws obvious
comparisons with George Lucas's
”American Graffiti" but
nonetheless elevates itself from
this genre by allowing the depth oi
the characters to shine through.

But i don't "know" Scruiiy the

pick up North Lounge and move it

why don’t you come with me Saturr
