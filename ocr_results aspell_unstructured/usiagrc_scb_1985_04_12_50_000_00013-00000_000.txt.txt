EWhat motivates the new recruit

The question of What motivates the
common soldier to choose his/her ocs
,Cupatlon is especially intriguing and
important in this age of the super-
mower and potential nuclear wariare.
Do the men and women who participate
in the largest warrmaking machines in
‘human history really understand ideas
such as “freedom". and have they
.iiiade a considered value judgement
about the best way to defend it? Or have
.they been tempted into uniiorm by ialse
promises oi sell-respect. the pressures
‘placed on them by a low educational
background, and a desire (or titillating
‘experiences such as ”seeing the
world i

Certainly ii this last view- were cor-
irect things would be a lot easier for
those who dislike the military m it
4becomes easier to condemn the
military when most of the military
‘can't express an adequate justification
for itself. Perhaps that's why the coins
nion soldier is sometimes portrayed as
Ia young person tabout as old as we are)
trapped in a moraliybankrupt career
ion behalf of causes he/she knows
nothing about. Perhaps that's why. as
‘some suggest the - mmon soldier

chosen his/her occupation [or reasons
in hlch have little to do with those tradi-
tioiiaily invoked to justiiy the military.

high school graduate who yoined the ar-

,the moral/ethical issues involved in
military service. and consequently cans

the dupes oi a cruel system which has
tricked them into their occupation
‘through a paucity ofeconomic alter»

natives combined with their ignorance
about the immense issues involved with
the military.

Recently a campus writer seemed to
espouse just such a view. which was
supported by discussions with soldiers
on why they Joined the military. But the
above view gets its evidence by asking
the iirong question. instead of “Why
did you Join the military" we should ask
"Hoit do you justity being a soldier," so
that the person involved knows what's
being asked tor specitically. After all. ii
one conversationally asked a member
oi the Peace Corps why they
volunteered one might very well hear
i-casons sucii as "personal challenge"
'\iidcning horizons“ ”exploring a
possible career". and. yes. ”seeing dit~
lei-ciit parts oi the world “Helping
humanity " might certainly be ii reason.
but the volunteer for whatever reason
didn't mention it right away Can one

general questions to automatically pro

complex topic here one to ask speciiic
questions oi soldiers about Justifying
the military one might be surprised to
discover that their answers go beyond
increasing their buying power and
bciieliting iroin taxssupported tourism.

1 knon one soldier \tlio'd give a sur-
prising answer. lle's my cousin. Andy,
who joined the Army aiter graduating
li‘om High School and “he's stationed
on the border between East and West

Germany. i haven't talked with inm in
a while. but his letters home get :1 little
circulation in our iamily. and they hint
that his reasons tor being a soldier go
beyond his desire for economic stability
and his-being unaware oi the moral
"big picture" oi military service.

one letter related how Andy viatcherl
through binoculars as Soviet border
guards machinerguiined scvcral East
German civilian workers who were try»
ing to get across the border into the
Vlest Germany. Another letter describe
ed his reaction to seeing the Berlin Wall
and his wondering what kind of a
system must need electriiied barbed-
wire and concrete to keep its people
trom deserting it Still another detailed
his unit's feelings after the Soviets
murdered 269 innocent men. women,
and children who inadvertently "invade
ed" Soviet airspace last year \vliile
passengers on a civilian airliner.

Apparently. for Andy. there are
other. higher, reasons tor being in
uniiorm and putting in 20»hour days oi
hard. physical labor toiten ior weeks at
a time) than those dictated by his Cir-
cumstances. Perhaps he knows that a
country which places armies oi occupar
tion in East Germany and gives iliem
orders to kill anyone who dares reject
socialist periection. or which sends
hundreds or innocent people to their
deaths ior no real reason requires ms
ed guards. Perhaps he thinks there's a
diiierence between a political system
where people worry about "too many"
immigrants and one which devotes
much at its resources to devising new
ways to kill escapees. Maybe in ins mvll
non-liberal arts way he's concluded
that‘there's something here uortii pro
tecting. and that it must be protected by
using the only language its enemies
comprehend e the threat oi iorce.
Maybe that‘s at least one oi the reasons
Vihy Andy became a soldier.
