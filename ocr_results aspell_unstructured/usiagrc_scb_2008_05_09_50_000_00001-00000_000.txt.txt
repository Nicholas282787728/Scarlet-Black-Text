Goering delivers State of the College

BYMATTZMUDKA

Preceding the last Joint Board or the year, on Wednes-
day SGA President Megan Gecring delivered the State
of the College address, describing abundant progress to a
scant crowd of Grinnell students.

Geering addressed severnl issues, inelrrdrng student
advocacy, student life, policy changes and goals {or future
SGA administrations. She also spoke at length about new
administrators thnt hnd been hired, notably special A55ise
tant to the President on Diversuy Elena Benin] and Vice
President of student Affairs Houston Doughnrty.

Nick DePetris ‘08 said that this was his First State of
the School speeeh, but he learned much by attendrng. “i
knew some people thin that a lot ofthe issues SGA deals
with are somewhat poi tless, hut hearing everything they
have accomplished in a giant, 45 minute long list has really
changed my perspective," he sard.

Near the end, Geering addressed the recent hate crimes
and campus responses, including the recent tracas involve
ing ptide ﬂags in the dining hall. To that end, Gocting
wants future SGA administrations to examine “what kinds
of policies we have lurking around earnprrs that can he det—
rimental to students and how to move those in a direction
to support more students."

John Burrows ‘10, SGA VI’SA—elect, explaincd that the
new cabinet viewed the speech as a launching point for
next year. “We're definitely using the speeth as n startrng
point to gauge what's been done well this year nnd which
projects need to be picked up again next year," he said.

The address, rescheduled from a week prior, drew less
than ten students who were not present or future members
ofJoint Board. In an e-mail statement sent to the $88,
Geerrng wrote that the address was initially cancelled be-
cause “SGA hit overload this past weekend because ofthe
coming together or the Board or Trustees, Pride Week,
SGA reform in Joint Board and a number otother projects
rneludrng personal academics."

DePctris, who attended the speech, thought that its
timing during ‘Hell Week’ limited attendance “Hell chk
is never a good time for things to he held, although obvi-
ously it is a. appreprrate trme tor a sumrnnty or the year
to occur," he said. Burrows agreed, adding “I think that in
order to get more people to come it, should he held at a
different time and maybe with free food."

Goerrng listed next year's priorities as gaining 24ehour
building access, reviewing international rrnaneial aid, and
adding student voices to college marketing, to name a few.

‘Smokefree’

Ban to affect the smoking lounge

BY PETER HENRY

It looks as if Cleveland Lounge will ﬁnally he quitting cold
turkey. A l'rle’mll‘illIC amendment to the Smoket’ree Air Act that
extended the smoking prohibition to cover “private educational
fa ilities and common plnees" will snub out the lounges smoking
privileges by the beginning of the fall semester.

This week, the college’s legal council revieued the net nnd
hriefcd college administrators on the impact ofthe law, “It appears
as if Grinncll college is direetly and thoroughly affected by the
Smokefree Air Act,” said President Russell Osgood.

The Sniokcfrtc Air Act, which goes into full eKectJuly 1, pro
hibits smelting in all places accessible to the public, including, but
not limited to, bars, restaurants and outdoor seating at sporting
events. A specific pron
vision was added to the
origrnal net to include
all private universities.
Corrtroversrally, exempe
tions have been made
for casino ﬂoors, veter»
ans' hospitals and the
Iowa State Fair.

“It's shocking," said
Osgood. “The state al-
lows srneking in casinos, and we en d
halls?"

Osgood said he opposed the bau's applicability to Cleveland
Lounge on the grounds that it is a residentinl area. “1 don't think
smokers should be treated as errtnrnals, particularly since, for many
students. its equivalent to a home rather than a public place."

The eireet of the ban on smoking outdoors is eurrently uneer-
tain. Aeeording to the act, smoking will be prohibited on “School
grounds, including parking lots, athletic ﬁelds, playgrounds, tennis
courts and any other outdoor arca under the control ofa public or
private educational facility" The administration does not know
whether this refers to the entrrety ofa campus or just individual
outdoor facilities. Smoking rs already prohibited in loggins.

Progress made
on wind turbines

HYJAI Grim;

\Nith the windmill at CERA iii full twirl, the college has
begun the process for the next step in bringing wind energy to
Grinncll,

Since last October, the college has utilized wind models and
identiﬁed six potential sites that would most suit the four vln'nd
turbines.The administration is currently in the process of negoti-
ating leasing rights to land property located north of campus,

By leasing the land as opposed to purchasing it, the school
hopes to work with landowners rather than alienate them.“This
is a way for people to continue to get henet‘rts throughout the»
life ofthc nirbinc,”said VlCETPRSlant oflnstitutional Planning
Marci Sortor. Since the school will be leasing the land, landown-
ers will receive continuous compensation for the turbines, even if
a new landowner moves in.

Though there is no speciﬁc timetable tor negotiations, wind
advocates hope to have the land lenses acquired by the end of the
summer, “We have had really positive testtlts,”said FTP member
Emily Stiever ’09. “As of now, we have not had any sort or nega-
tive feedback"

Apart from neqtrirrng the leasing rights, many obstacles will
need to be cleared in order for the wind turbines to be construct»
ed. Since the turbines will not be located on campus, the school
must run wires rrom the turbines to campus. The wires wrll be
underground and run mostly along the rarlways and roads leading
to campus.

Though the wires will not affect landowners, several proper
ties in town could be affecred by the disturbances caused by die
