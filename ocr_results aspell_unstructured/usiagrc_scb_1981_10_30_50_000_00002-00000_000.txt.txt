Sale price reported at $40,000

Mark Liberson is an entrepreneurial
psychology major With a keen mind tor
business, so when he learned this fall that
the Longhorn restaurant and lounge was
up for sale he made an offer that was ac-
cepted by a long-time owner Tom
Parmley. On Nov, 10 the Grinnell
sophomore will become the owner of what
has become a local legend.

Liberson, who would not reveal the
amount, reportedly paid $40,000 cash for
the business, He was for the most part able
to avoid the prevailing record high interest
rates that are keeping so many would be
fortune seekers out of the busmess world.
If present sales hold up and if the Grinnell
community embraces menu changes that
will include quiche, Chicken Kiev and New
England clam chowder. Liberson said his
venture will succeed,

almost started a restaurant business right
out of high school but my parents persuadr

place does well and I enjoy the business, 1
don't see any reasons not to continue pur-
suing my interests and exploring this
field."

Taking on a business that has been owns
ed by a local couple for 16 years, especially
one barely able to balance its books [or the
last couple or years, presents problems
even before a new management can
change its direction. Liberson, however.
said that he has already established good
relations with the more than 30 staIf
members and said his youth will be an
asset in making the restaurant a financxal
success.

“It hasn't been easy; the new adjust-
ment strained us a little at Iirsl, but we've

Liberson, the oldest son in his family,
