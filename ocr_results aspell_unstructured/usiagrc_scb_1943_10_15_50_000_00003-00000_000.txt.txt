"Ole J, B," - —

{hey Come From
. ~ "H, Wood"

By Murray FK‘OSll

A huge percentage of the sol-
dicis attending Grinncll had been
serving in the Almy Air Forces,
prior [0 their acceptance [oi the
Army Specialized Training pro
gram. Many of these men came
to Griiincll from leifcrson Bare
racks, Missouri, which is one of
the largest air corps basic train-
ing centers in the country.

A large portion at the men
who are now airplane mechanics,
radio-operators, aerial - gunners
and and armourers received eith-
or their basic training or ove v
seas training at Jefferson Bar-
racks. Most people that have
engaged in conversation with any
of these former air corps men
have undoubtedly heard their.
mention “Ole J, B." Although
tew will ever admit it, this ex—
pression is usually voiced with a
nostalgic air. This, however does
not occur without just cause, as
Jefferson Barracks provides one
of the most complete entertai
ment programs for any army post;
in the country. One of several
musical organizations at Jefferrl
soii Barracks is the Jive Bombers.

The orchestra, which has many
former professional players, cum»
pores tavorably with many flimv
ous bands, As a matter of fact
Capt. Glenn Miller, yes, the old
Maestro himself, will vouch tor
the last statement.

Before a man is sent to any
one of the dozens of technical
training schools, he is llltel‘vieWr
ed. It is then that he is given
an opportunity, if he qualities, to
enter one of these schools. This
is the method by which'calldi~
dates for A.S.T.l=, were selected
before they were sent to the star
unit,

Fort Leonard Wood is another)
camp that has supplied many
trainees for the ASL No. 4770.
This post is rather unusual in that
it has three different branches
of sci-Vice all stationed under one
command. There are units mm
the corps of Engineers, Infantry”
and Field Artillery that use the-
excellent facilities at Fort Wood
ior extensive training maneuvers,

It is no wonder that a post hav-
ing such varied activity is so in-
terosting, as many former basic
trainees claim.

Utilizing the valuable combat
training that they received at
Fort Wood, thousands of “alumni"
are presently engaged in “knock
ing the Germans off their axis
