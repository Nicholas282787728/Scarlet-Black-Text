Awaiting Orders

“N“? are here awaiting orders to

“’2 had orders last week to the cf—
feet that we were to leave this morn
ing at 5 o’clock. At 3 this Inol‘hingI
heard some of the squadrons out get-

leave, too, but our turn is Coming
next. I think it will be the ’Vatel's

"You Should see some of the planes
that are over at Field N0. 1. The
Italians have some of their makes
there, and they are real ships. One
has three ISO-horsepower motors in
it. The last few days some new ones
have come in that are real speed

When war was declared last
spring. six seniors, who had been
members of the Brock house and
friends thruout their college course,
enlisted with the Chicago University
ambulance corps,

They were, J. B. MzteGregol‘, Paul
Macaregor, Arthur Parsons, Ernest
Prelim, Hubert ’l‘arggart and Amos
Mathews. These x were later join-
ed by three other Grinuell men, Tem
ple Hurling, John Horn and Ed»
lllunll Halley. With the exception
of Amos Mathews, who joined the
aviation corps later in the summer,
all of these men are still with this
unit and seem to be more than satis-
ﬁed with their selection.

Altho other sections of the army
claim more than eight Grlunell rep~
resentatives, this is the only his
stance of several Gl'il'mell men join-
ing as a group.

This unit, which was organized
the latter part of last spring, has
been in training all summer turd
in now making a trip thrn the state
of Pennsylvania, giving exhibition
drills for the benefit of the various
.communitles. Their football team.
which is also traveling with them,
has met with remarkable success
this fall, since they have defeated
every army team which they have
encountered.

Early in the fall when a call was
issued to the several units of the
ambulance corps to volunteer for
immediate service in France, this
was one of the first to volunteer.
but ﬁnally was not accepted. At
the present time it is not known
when this unit -“l he sent to
France, but indications are that it
will go as soon as transportation
facilities can be provided,

HUGH MITGHELL TELLS
DF HIS LIFE IN EUHDPE

Lieut. Hugh Mitchell, ex '17, who is
now in Italy with the aviation corps,
seems to be satisﬁed with his life in
the army from every standpoint, if
one may judge from a letter which
was received from him recently. Exs
tracts from the letter follow:

“1 have had a ﬁne time since I
landed. I was in Paris for a couple
of weeks and spent most of the time
visiting the old buildings there, among
them the l’Opel‘d. It's a wonderful
building; the most wonderful one of
its kind in the world. I think that it

is the place where Jesse christian F

sang,

“Flying here is ﬁne, and these peo-
ple certainly have the planes and are
born mechanics. 1 was up the other
day about twenty thousand feet, and
tllerc was another fellow up so high

THREE

MILITARY TRAINING
TI] HELP STUDENTS .
AFTER JDINIHG ARMY

Captain Evans Believes Drill in
College Will Help Draft-
ed Men

GIVES ADVANTAGE DVER HEGRUIT

Disciplinary Value in Teaching
Obedience Is Also Very
Great

That the principal object of Grin-
Doll’s military drill is to teach the
college student those essentials of
military maneuvers which will be
helpful to him in case he is drafted
into the army was the assertion of
Capt. s. Evans. acting military i —
structo n discussing military tl'
ing in Grinnell.

Besides this practical advantage
derived from military drill, tberc is
also its disciplinary value in teach—
ing the student obedience and co»
operation.

Insight Into Military Affairs

If the Gl'innell student is drafted,
military drill will give him an insight
into military affairs, and will be of
very great assistance to him when
he has a chance to advance in
the ranks. It will give him a big ad—
vantage over the untrained recruit.
and “especially for the ﬁrst few
weeks will save him a lot of cussing
and bawling out."

Capt. Evans stated that next spring,
when the battalion can be drilled as
a unit. military drill should take on
a new and wider aspect. Sham bat~
tles, practice marches, drill in ex-
tended order, outposts and scouting
parties should prove to be interest»
mg, and at the same time beneficial
and instructive. During the cold
weather, however. company drill will
he thd, as usual, in the armory.

FIlIg Contest in Spring

One feature of the drill this year
will be the flag contest. This will
take place some time in the spring.
and the company showing the most
excellence and ability in drillingwill
he presented with an American flag.
The flag was won last year by Co. A,

The names of the lieutenants and
sergeants of the three companies are;
Lient. Arthur Child, school of music;
Co. A, First Sergeant Tyler Barney
'21, Sergeants Frank Wilcoxen '21,
Robert McCormick '20, Paul Somers

geants Ben Ellsworth '19, Fred

eral weeks ago have not yet or—
rived, but should be here very soon,

“Whit” Helps Soldier Eleven

Win Close Game

George Whltrner, ex 20, of Des
Moines, who was the ﬁrst of the 40,.
000 selected men to register at Camp
Dodge, is now playing center on the
Camp Dodge football team,

“Whit," it will be remembered was
the captain of last year's freshman
team. He is a powerful man on the
gri rod, and had he remained in
school would doubtless have been an
important factor in winning Grin-
nell’s football battles this fall.

In the game between Camp Dodge
and Camp Funston of Kansas last
Saturday, in which the Des Moines
ttani was winner by a a to a score
by a drop kick in the ﬁnal quarter,
wnitmer was substituted for Cook
and played a stcllar game.

As the Camp Dodgc elevcn today
meets tlle‘ztll'slatc tcam picked by
Des Moines critics, which includes
Augustine, Osgood. Watt and "Dad"
Hoyt of Grinnell, Whitmcr is prob»
ably opposing the men whom he had

hoped to play with for Grihnell this
fall.
