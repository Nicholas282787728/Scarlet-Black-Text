Editor

The Scarlet and Black
Grinnell, Iowa

Dear Sir:

Yesterday on the town men's bub
letin board, between the
Recitation hall and thc library, there
was posted an apology to the women
of Grinnell college. This same
apology, drawn up by the
men in the dormitories at Grin-
nell, was rggid before the girls in the
quad dining 'roonl yesterday noon.

The fact that the men of Grinnell
'took such .a step after realizing the
mistake, that was made during the

stunts at the Colonial theater during-

for the
prevail

Victory day, speaks well
standards of decency dint
here,

I do not believe that the letter was
meant as a condemnation of victory
day, I am not condemning victor-y
day, for as a participant in the cele»
bration I could not help but feel that
it was worthwhile, with the excep-
tion of some of the stunts given at
the theater. some of the wit and
repartee between acts was over done,
also.

These things do not tend to make
us, as students, feel better, do they?
Do you have a smart feeling over the
results? And do you suppose that it
has improved the opinion of others
toward our activities? Instead, i
am afraid that it has given to out—
siders a feeling of disgust and‘ has
left is the mouths of the students a
hitter taste. -

Sincerely yours.
Jim Morrison.

'Editor

'The Scarlet and Black
‘Grlnnell, Iowa

Dear Sir:

From my hotel window I have a
choice of two views. I can look down
on the dirt and untidiness of a city
courtyard, or I can. at night, look up
at the Lindbergh air beacon, dashing

Alumni ‘

its message of guidance and safety
400 miles across the sky. The choice
IS mine to make.

Similarly, we all have a choice of
views as we look down at the imperu
fcctions, we can measure the distance
by which Gi-innell falls short of real-
izing her professed aims. Or we can
look up at the beacon light of Grin-
nell liberalism, Grinnell scholarship,
Crihnell sportsmanship, which has
ﬂashed undirnnied across the middle-
wcstern sky for so years, at first
illuminating but little more than an
empty pl‘dil‘ieinow shining on the
very heart and center of American
life.

Won't all of youifaculty, students,
alumniithink something about
your choice of viewpoints. We
of the public relations staff
are trying to present the second view-
point in a convincing manner to the
educators, the men and women, of
the central states. We want them to
symbolize Gr nell as a Pioneer in
education for li ing.

Crinnell blazing a trail as the‘ ﬁrst
college beyond the Mississippi, ﬁrst
to admit women for full collegiate
training, first to recognize the sign
ﬁconce of organized work in physir
cal education, and ﬁrst to develop
the house plan of dormitory construc—
tion. It is this adventuresome Grin-
nell that we are trying to present
to all who will listen. .

Unless you also believe in this
Grinncll and preach this gospel, our
efforts will count for nothing. After
all, it is what you say about the
school that matters tremendously. We
can do more than second the motion,

If you speak apologetically about
Grinnell, it can be no more than an
apologetic kind of college. “Oh, it‘s
a little school out in Iowa." At once
it is classiﬁed with several hundred
institutions that represent a dead
level of mediocrity in American edu»
chtion,

If you speak of Grinnell as a school
that has led out in movements which
Harvard, Yale, and similar schools
have since been glad to follow, people
hundreds of miles away begin to say,
”Maybe we ought to know about this
Grinnell. Maybe We're missing some-
thing." It is this type of word-of-
mouth advertising done by Grinnell-
ians, who have caught the message
of their college, whch we can thank
for our educational position today,

All of us everywhere must not only
continue our efforts; we must re-
double them. Other colleges are also
marching ahead. Grinnell would no
longer be Crinnell if it fell behind.

Constantly I and introduced by
hardrhended high school principals
as the representative of ”one of the

two best colleges in the middle-west"
. . . . “a. school that maintains as high
standards as the University of Chica-
go" . . . . "a college that does every-
thing in a thorough and scientiﬁc
iashiou." Any business corporation
recognizes goodwill as one of its
greatest assets. It is Grinnell's great»
est asset, far more valuable than
millions in endowment.

This goodrwlll must not be lost by
any carelessness of ours. Its main
tennricc is the joint responsibility of
you of the strident body, you of the
faculty, you of the alumni group. For
it is true of Grinnell men and women,
as it was said by President Ruthven
oi the graduates of the University of
Michigan, that "they graduate not
from the college, but into the college."

Let the Homecoming football
game, played with worthy and friends
ly focmen, be the symbol of an awak-
ened Grinnell, bent iipon playing the
whole game of college life with the
same zeal which it put into the con-
test.

Ever cordially yours,

Few Book Reviews

Dr. Steiner goes farther than mere
contemplation of the horde which in-
vades Europe each summer. There is
a real sympathy of understanding of
the fundamental differences between
the red-blooded new world tourists,
”tense as race-horses," and the pale—
pink outlook of the people of the old

Goodwin Recital
at Homecoming
Merits Praise

By H. w. MATLACK

A ﬁne string of favorites was pre
sented to early Homecomcrs in Prof.
Hugo Goodwin's fourth twilight or-
gan rccital Friday after-noon, begin»
ning with the melodious "Stradella"
overture by Flotow, and including
Dvorak's “Largo,” the Turkish march
from Beethoven’s music to the “Ruins
of Athens,” and Schumann’s ”Res
manee in F” as examples of
mrisic which have stood the test of
time.

Less familiar, but thoroughly der
lightful, were Napravnik's “Cossack
Cradle Song" and Mr. Goodwin’s own
“Fountain Sparkling in the Sunlight."
This last achieves a degree of sucr
cossful imagery often attempted in
organ music, but seldom realized.
Compared with Dubois' “Fiat Lux,”
with which Mr. Goodwin concluded
the program, it is much more effec-

world who receive them.

The book review section. although
rather limited as to the number of
books reviewed, carries out quite
adequately the wellvtouuded impress
ion, which is the outstanding feature
of the magazine as a whole.

tive.

Professor Goodwin put a good stiff
backbone, not to say a tough one, in-
to his program in the ﬁnale of Reub-
ke's ”NintyrFourth Psalm" organ
sonata, a sermon in polysyllabic
counterpoint, which, in spite of the
masterly performance wh;ch Mr.
Goodwin gave it, still remains a ser-
mon in polysyllabic counterpoint, But
an occasional sermon is good for us.
