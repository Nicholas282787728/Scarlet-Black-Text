Over one month after students voted on
a record number of initiatives, the STIFund
Committee has finally begun rhc slow work of
implementing rhc various requests. The coin-
mittee, chaired by Allison Amphlett '08, has
met twice since the student initiative voting
in September “Vi/e decide what we think STI-
Fund can fund, and what needs some sort of
work or advocacy to happen,” she said.

Despite some difficulties, progress has
been made on many of this year's initiatives.
The renaming ofrhc campus pub, for instance,
required little effort because it required no
money ro put in place. Ofrbe 21 initiatives the
committee is considering, Amphlett said that
most did not require funding, and would be
easier to implement. Other initiatives, how-
ever, have been more difficult to enact.

In order to work on the initiatives, the
committee has broken into smallcr groups ro

work on individual proposals. “It’s a process.
You have to figure ourwho is in charge, contact
them, meet with them and from there you don’t
really know,” said committee member Christy
Boeckholt '08. “STIFund
is some ways is not aptly
named. We do more than
fund, we also help imple-
menting whatever way the
projects need "

“We're pretty much
planning on funding the
speakers for Loos-c Loungc
and Younker," added Ame
phlctt, One other project
near completion this year is the commission
ing ofa portrait ofdiliiiig hall supervisor Lyle
Baumnn,

“VVe’l-c drafting an all-campus c-mail look-
ing for any student interested in painting the
portrait," Amphlett said. “Most likely we would

”We want to use our money a:

pay for materials and there would bc some sort
ofcash reward. Lyle will be involved in choos-
ing the final design, and his wife.”

Boeckholt added that international news
sources were also likely to
be found in lounges soon.

A few of this year's
initiatives have run into
some troublel‘he proposal
to use Google software in
place of Outlookweb has
run into informal opposiv
ticn, although according to
Amphlcrr, a rcprcsentarivc
from Google will be com-
ing to campus in the future. Ainphlctt also
lamented the bureaucracy involved in placing
hand saniiizer in computer labs, having to turn
to multiple campus departments for answers,
information and funding.

From last year's nututnvcs, the muchsant

ticiparcd swingscr, to be located east onounk-
er Hall, has been delayed due to problems
with the manufacturer. However, according to
Brad Bishop '08, SGA treasurer, it should are
rive within a week and. if the ground does not
freeze, FM will install it shortly thereafter.

While work progresses on student initia-
tives, the STIFund itself will be up for res
consideration by Joint Board near the end
of spring 2008.1ts szs,noo is a large part of
the SGA budget, and there have been discus-
sions about reducing the funding, “We didn’t
use anything close to it [the funding] last year.
Wc don't know ifwe necessarily need to tie up
325,000," Amphicrr said.

Despirc the large funding base, the STIr
Fund committee still works to examine all
campus resources before dippinginto the fund.
“We want to use our money as a last resort,”
Amphlett said. “lfother people should be payr
ing for it, we’re not going to."

You said in your talk that every choice we make about our
bodies is political and, in most cases like wearing makeup,
brings us in line with the hegemonic social control of our
bodies. But then you wear lipstick and don't seem to feel bad
about in How do you draw the line between ﬁghting the man
and still wanting to look pretty?

There’s no line to draw, but it is a matter of net
gotiation and we can be more aware of those nego-
tiations, We know there are people who don't think
about these things critically, who don’t think about
where their clothing is made. So it’s a continuum of
action choices, but it all starts with critical awareness ‘
I’m not here to tell people how far to take their poli-
ties. as far as consumer culturc and complying with
the scripts of gender or whatever. I’m just trying to get people
to think about it.

For yourself, your job is to critically analyze what people
wear and what that decision means. So how do you get ready
in the morning without it b ng a huge political act?

Vl/cll, it is a huge political act, but I'm used to it. I've been
gcrring dressed a lot oftnoruiugs.

In most colleges, we’re in sort ofa bubble where we talk
about heteronormativity, feminism, how do you feel when you
get into actual culture and there’s so much of this stuff that
contradicts your work? Can you even watch TV any more?

Well, you know, i have my moments of pure entertainment,
too, things which are too fun not to watch, where we suspend
certain kinds of convictions. But there are other things I watch
because it's extremely interesting to keep track of the culture
and where's it going and what kinds of forms of power is it
manifesting?

What shows do you ﬁnd yourselfwatching with that criti-

 

cal eye?

Recently, I’ve picked up that show Big Love, that show
about polygamy and Molmon communities. I was just blown
away how I just got sucked into it. I’m watching it and I’m
like, “Polygamy, oh my gosh, no way." And then I'm watching
rhc way the relationships between the wives arc being depicted
and they’re actually extremely intelesting relationships. Like,
they're more interesting in some ways than the real between
the husband and the various wives The relationships between
the women become my focal point. so that's my example of
how I’ve gotten hooked into this story I thotight the whole
premise was ridiculous . . but all ofa sudden, I was intrigued.
It doesn’t pay to have our beads in the sand and as a teacher, as
always good to be able to tap into cultural connections

What do you think society is telling women to—
day about love?

There’s a couple different dominant messages out
there. There's a couple messages to younger women
‘ about the virgin movement among this movement to
get married, there’s a whole reassertion of the insti-
tution of marriage among young people, so one of
the messages out there is stick with the heterosexual
paradigm and get married and rheu your sex should
conform to traditional ideas about sanctioned sex through mar-
riage and family building. Another message that's out there is
like a Sex in the City—type messagewhich is about individual
choice: That we're in a postrfcminist age right now so women
have just all these choices, They can work in diffcrcnr carccrs
that they ﬁnd compelling and financially rewarding, they can
afford to travel to so-called exotic places, experiment with
sex. It’s almost like a hypertcomniodity culture that gender
and sexual are part of So it's about ceniesmeenietmincytmoe,

whatd my favorite flavor ofice cream?

I imagine the most difﬁcult thing to do as a feminist
parent would be choosing positive toys and movies for your
kids.

sue. Deﬁnitely no Princesses—1 brought home one of those

she “works well with people, has vision, is ar-
ticulate and thoughtful and is able to deal with
difficult situations."

Smith is also responsible for addressing
and responding to the academic concerns of
the faculty. "[The job] is parallel to student life
for faculty members," Swartz said,

As dean, Smith said she hopes to balance
her responsibilities to the academic program
and support to the faculty while taking ad-
vantage of Grinnell's unique opportunities.
“Grinnell is in a great place to dream about
what it wants to do,“ she said "And it's in a
great place to carry out those dreams."

Among her goals, Smith plans to set forth a
vision that emphasizes examining current and
future building usage, improvmg accessibility,
exploring opportunities for interdisciplinary
interaction and supporting expanded learning

experiences such as the MAP program. “As
dean, I would love to give that even more of a
higher profile,"she said,

To support the faculty role on campus,
Smith said that she would assist faculty in bal—
ancing their time between
the classroom and neat
demic researchr “Ifthe fact
ulry can balance their time,
they can be more fulfilled
and students can benefit,"
she said

Smith and Osgood
both agree that the college
is currently in a position to
move forward with excite
ing new academic opportunities. “This collcgc
is at a particularly great moment to be dean,”
Osgood said. “our resourccs are ample. the

more now.”

"th’nne/lstands out very well
We really gresuper/or l oat

Paula Smith, English,
Incoming dean of the College

EKI is really adding more depth and texture
to the academic program,"

Smith inherits a position that has for the
past decade of growth been widely shaped by
the Swartz's efforts “He’s the most hardworkt
ing academic administrator
that I've worked with," os-
good said of Swartz. “He’s
extraordinarily able at han-
dling multiple tasks simul-
taneously."

Swartz has also ac
cepted a position on the
leadership team of Project
Kaleidoscope, a project that
encourages collaboration
between faculty and curricular development
to improve undergraduate science education.
He said he is proud to be leaving "a group of

faculty members that are ready and willing to
take on leadership roles."

"They're an excellent faculty," he said.
“Substantially more diverse than 10 years ago
[and] a group of people looking to the fur
ture to do things we've not yet imagined,"

Smith admitted that she had big shoes to
fill, and said she would be in frequent com-
munication with Swartz during the transition
process.

Still, she is excited to begin, “I continue to
learn great things about the college, even after
20 years," she said. “l'm going over there and
educating myself. ”

And as a parent of a prospective student,
Smith brings a more personal perspective to
the dcanship. “Grinneil stands out very well.
We really arc superior,"shc said. “I appreciate
that about Grinnell even more now."
