New movies at a piece of Grinnell's past

livALl SARGENT

in spite otvarious ownership changes over
the past 90 years, the GrinneLl Herald was cor
rect in 1916 when it said the newly opened
Strand Theater is “a theater that will be a
credit to Grinnell for years to come," While its
doors have been closed at times since then. the
Strand reopened tour years ago as part of an
effort to rejuvenate downtown Grinnell,

Despite the college bringing multiple mow
ies to campus each week rhrough SGA ﬁlms.
the Stmnd provides that special movivgoing
experience Haltis Cinema cannot offer. “It
provides a ditterent type otenvirenmcnr,"said
Jeff Sinick’09,last year’s SGA Films chain

The Strand boasts three screens and a
lobby modernized to have a “rough look,"“We
actually won awards for architectural design,"
said Andy Vet‘sendaal, the current manager or
the Strand. A visit to the Strand also provides
a taste of Grinnell heritage, as the old entrance
to the theater holds two original seats, a display
case of old theater altifacts and a recreation of
the original tile ﬂoor. “The original stage is
behind screen number two," said Versendaal.

Even though the Strands main goal is ro
cater to the families of Grinnell, it does have
strong ties to the school. “The college invested
a lot of money to get the theater up and run-
ning," said Siniclt,

Discount tickets are available to students
at both the bookstore and the Grill, and the
theater welcomes students at the start of each
year by handing out posters and tree tickets.
“I think there's a lot of support," Versendaal
said of his college patrons. Versendaal added
that for the most part the students are well-
behaved, at least "when they don’t bring alco—
hol."

The SGA Films chairs communicate with
the Strand several times a semester, mostly to
coordinate special evenrs, such as purchasing
entire screens for midnight showings orbloclce
busters like Syrdermmi 3 last year.

“We have a really good relationship wirh
the Strand," said Sinick. “I got to know the
manager pretty well."

However, as the college has no power in
inﬂuencing the line up. *1 wish we had more
control over the movies they brought," said
Sinick, but “the Strand doesn’t even get any
say in what they show,”

A group of investors in town own the

then rotates them through.

As a result, the Strand doesn't always get
big movies opening weekend, if it gets them at
all. “It's kind of frustrating that it takes so long
for movies to get there," said Becca Weiner

Even if the selection can sometimes leave
something to be desired, students still enjoy
the fact that they have the option of going to
a movie downtown and watching something
besides the months-old films at Harris "It’s
probably one ofthe few places 1 go in town to
socialize,” said Mike Jugenheimer ’09.

Award-winning pie and meat fill the menu

While most Grinnell students may think there are only the five to 10 standard eating options in town, the sur-
rounding areas offer many great dining options (without making you drive to Des Molnes or Iowa City). The 5&3 is
running a new feature, sending writers out to resturants in the region to help people find these small-town gems.

Known for substantial home cooking, the Coffee cup Cafe
in Sully (18.7 miles from Grinnell) has existed since 1917.
Walking in, it feels like you are in a smallrtown restaurant.
The simple interiors greet patrons, featuring only vintage pho—

You quickly become aware that this is a familymwned and

One ofthe things you rirsr notice on rhe Corrcc Cup Café's
menu is a listofaccolades from various news organizations. At
the top of the list is NPR’s proclamation that it is one of the
“Best Places to Eat” in the country. Certainly one ofthe main
reasons that the restaurant earned this reputation is for the pie.

pie, and I’m glad I did. The sharp tanginess or the vegetable
pairs well with the sweet and ﬂaky crust that mclrs in your

The Coffee Cup Café doesn’t do health food or vegerarian
dishes. What is does do very well is stickrto—your-tibs food
