Coggeshstll Scores Eleven Points
As Pioneers Beat Milwaukee
Squad 23 to 22.

DRAKE BEATS TANKSTERS

Bulldogs Set—Two Valley Records
As They Smother Local Squad
By Heavy Margin.

As two Pioneer squads went into
action last weekend, one managed to
bring in victory by a one point mar-
gin and tire other lost to a faster.
more experienced squad. Fighting all
the way, never being far behind, the
Crinneii cagers managed a 23~22 vic-
toi, over Marquette but Drake swims
nlers were too much for the local
squad as they won so to 15, break-
ing two Missouri valley records and
winning all but one event

While Captain Coggeshall or the
Pioneers and O'Donnell, Marquette
forward, matched baskets with no lite
tie precision Saturday night, two buss
lretball teams played another or these
games often read about. Tile com-
pai-ative worth of the two squads is
well shown by the fact that liar-
quette could only get a two point mar-
gin on its home rioor and Grinnell
nabbed the honors by a single point
here.

Millier Shirts Scoring

Only at dne time Were tiic teams

more than two poiilts apart in the

, scoring of the game. Minier started
the scoring with a field goal hilt
Schntte matched it for the v' tors.
hiinier retaliated with another and
Andrews registered with a gift toss.
some game continued throughout
the opening half, the score being 10
to {i tor Crinnell at the half.

Field goals by Andrews and King
and free throws by Andrews and
o'Donnell gave Marquette a 15 to 10
lead shortly after the opening of the
second halt. Grinllell soon whittled
this down and took a 17 to 15 lead,
however, with eight minutes to go
O'Donnell scored for Marquette hilt
Coggeshall showed him his error by
scoring himself. O'Donnell tried it
again and Coggey matched his toss
With 31,; minutes of playing time re—
maining Grinnell led 2 ito 19. in the
ﬁnal minutes O'Donnell scored a free
throw which left Crinnrll a lead of
a single point hilt it was suiticient
for victory.

Coggeshall and O'Donnell were the
oftensive stars of the game while Ge-
hert played well at guard. He stopped
the forwards nicely and he went the
distance with ‘a single personal.

Early in the game Marquette oc-
casionally swung in behind the Grin-
neii defense for sleeper shots but the
offense was soon solved and most of
the scores in the last half came from
shots back of the foul circle,
