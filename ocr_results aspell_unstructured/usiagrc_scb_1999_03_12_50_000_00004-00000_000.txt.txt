somcrhing jusr wasn'r righr. For
some reason, nry inrerview wirh Bryan
Dunham. 'oo, wasn'r going very well
and I had a sneaking suspicion ir was
because he wasn’t talking that mueh.

Could it be that there is a
Grinnellian who doesn’t have a seri-
ous mission in life, whether it be to
end racism on campus or reform SGA?

The more I rhoughr abour ir, it
made me kind ofrelieved.

Dunham noted that he worked in
the registrar and was editor of The
Gum.

“lr's sorr ofmissing in acrion righr
now," he said. “We’re looking for a
primer.”

‘So that seemed sort ofinterestingi
but he didn't offer any more informa-
tion. '

“I don't really do any volunteer
work or anyrhing like rhar," Dunham
said.

“I really don’t do much at all. I
like ro warcth, anyrhing M.T.V, ir‘s
just sort of campy and ridiculous,"

At the next rable, a girl lers our sorr
ofa shriek. Laughing, she apologizes.

“Do ir again,“ replied Dunham, in
a calm, friendly voice,

His major is psychology, though he
doesn’t seem terribly excited about
that, either.

“Hopefully I’ll be here dris sum.
mer opening rar heads," he said, de»
scribing the summer research he ap»
plied for under Professor Ken Short,

"rye only seen himlecrure once,
he seemed sort of manic and all over
the place.” *

I ask him ifhe’s sure he wants me
to include that. He looks me straight
in rhe eye and answered, “I don’r carer"

And after Grinnell?

“I don’t know," he said, “My
grandparenrs ask me rhe same dring.
i usually roll rhcm I’m going ro grad
school and that usuallysatisﬁes them,"

“l’rn a vegerarian," he offered, “I

caring animals is wrong."

lusr ro be argumenrarive (and hops
ing to make him defensive) I asked if
he rhinks earing animal producrs is
also wrong.

Never falrering he said, “Veganism
is somerhing I’d invesrigare ifI had
more rimeon my hands ro rhinkabour
whar 1 car, All I car now is mac and
cheese.”

At this poinr rm forced ro fall back
on rhe one ropic i didn’t really wanr
ro discussithe recent SGA clecrion,

“I wanrcd ro run," said Dunham,

.“because I’ve seen some ncgarivc

shanks said as people have regis»
reied for rhe service.

"Basically, it’s a mailing lisr and a
char room so give people the oppor-
runiry to posr iniormarion abour

”We’re also rrying ro keep discus»
sion goingairour whar people look for

Participants in

"[Daring services] don'r work be-

Johnson, sophomore in accounring,
When EmilyOlson,scniorinmar»

said.
Josh Edwards, freshman in corn-
muniryand regional planning, agreed.
“I usually rhink rhar rhcy’re kind
oflikc a lasr resorr kind ofrhing," he
said.

He broughr up rhe facr rhar he
came in lasr place. “That kinda hurt,”

That was cerrainly thc height of
our discussion unril he mentioned
beards.

“rm anribeard tor the mosr pair,
They don’t look good," Dunham
voiced.

“coarees arcalirrie roo trendy but
rhey‘re okay for disco.,,exccpr for Jacob
Berrrand. His beard rorailyworksand
he would look srrango without it."

i asked him ifhe'd seen Bertrand
without a beard ar any poinr.

“No," he said, “But i can rorally
imagine.”

Toward rhe end of rho interview
he asked ifhe could pur a “shout out

When our ralk was over, Dunham
gor up and wandered ro the comer of

ring a head srarr ror his rapidly ap.
proaching midrscms. All ofa sudden,
rhcrc was a crack oflighrcning beforc

wirh Brut, when 10' he beheld 2.mle
racuious sighr. ‘

lr was‘n'r a bird, ir wasn'r a plane,
it wasn’t even Supermans lr was a gi-
anr disco ball hurriing across rhe sky.
Dazed and confused from his encounr
rer wirh rhe supernarural, Joe prayed
for a sign rhar would rcll him whar ro
do.

No sooner had he shur his eyes,
rhan KAPOWl he was knocked un-
conscious by a silver cucumber.

The disco gods had spoken.

When Joe carne ro, he was wears
ing form nrring bell borroms and a
baby blue suit with wide lapcls and a
righrshirr, more rhan halfunburroncd
in order ro show offhis newly devel-

oped chesr hair.

Around his neck hung several
gold chains and he was sporring side
burns and an afro rhar would have
made the Jackson Five proud.

In his hand was rhc silver cucumr
bar and, hnding no pockers in his
panrs ro safcly srorc this rreasure, Joe
pur ir down rhe from of his rrousers

But a mysterious rracror bean-i
cmanaring rrom a large building sud-
denly srarred ro magncrically arrracr

When asked whar their predicrions
for me big evenr are (in lighr of the
{ad that the whole year has iusr been
one big preseason for gerring those
iivcrs in shape for Disco), sellers and
lrioy replied: "We predicr insaniry, vior
larion of rhe are codes, scrufiy look-

Hoy rakes ir one srep funher by
voicing his belief rhar, "the rwo disco

Allin all, Disco promises ro bebig.

Jeffery Zdiinek srares rhar, “Disco

“The Men Who sruff Their
