As participants in Alternative Break, several Grinnciiians left the bubble
to reconnect with the outside world, and they have demonstrated that
apparently it’s possible to return to the bubble undamaged. With the hopes
of learning something new, four groups orsrudonts went to several sues
over fall break, including the Boys and Girls Club in Minneapolis, Ntttsiro
ceiitro and open Hands in Chicago, and [lie oglnla Lakota Reservation
in South Dakota, Tlicsc Student: Cthl‘ found a common bond within their
grottp, a new understanding about their site or the situation they saw and
a desire to go on more Alternative Breaks our day.

Uglala Lakota SIOUX Reservation

Pine Ridge, 5. D.

Arrcr a long drive our to the reservation, the group that went to Pine
Ridge had quite an eye—opening experience.

They worked sorting clothes and donations for NAAICCE (National
Association for American lndran Children and Elders), an organization
founded by Vaslrti Hurst, who came to the reservation with her husband
10 years ago, said group leader Ursula Hill ‘04.

They also worked at the Suzanne Big Crow Boys and Girls Club clear.
ing space for sports fields.

“Though... we were able to get a lot oigood work done," said Hill,
“the most rewzrdlng parts of the trip were just the people who we got to
talk to."

Some orchese people brought interesting life experiences to the reset»
vatton Bobbie, a Lakota E RA. worker, experienced the 1970s Wounded
Knee occupation and later left the reservation to pursue an education and
eventually work in the circus Pastor Robertson is a Cherokee married to
a Lakora and was one of the first police ofﬁcers to come to the Wounded
Knee slicini Part ofRobertson's responsibilities as a Lutheran minister in-
clude working to improve reservation housing; Geraldine is an amazing
woman who helps out with rho kids in the neighborhood in many differs
enr ways.

some or the biggest problems residents or the reservation currently
combat include education, unemployment (which is npproximaldy 90%),
housing, poverty, loss ofculrure, domestic violence, alcohol, and relations
with the us. government.

“All ofrhesc [problems] are at the tip ofeveryonc's tongues," Hill said,
“but it doesn't really seem like anyone has a solution."

“it was interesting to really make the connection between the reserva-
tion and other poor rural areas," continued Hill, who thought that the
trip was intense but also somewhat hopeful.

Chicago, Ill.

The trip to open Hands, an organization that provides food to people
with HIV or AIDS, was extraordinary. suid group leader Sarah Weiss ’04.
And even though the group was very busy at their sites, they got a chance
to see a lor or the city.

The group worked at five diffcrcnr sites, including the Living Room
Cafe, Genesis House, the Sn casn Catholic Worker, open Hands Cl-ri-
cago, and the Greater Chicago hood Depository to provide housing, food
and services to low-income and homeless people.

Genesis House provides food, daytime shelter and counseling to re
covering drug addicts and prostitutes, “For [Genesis House], we painted
the upstairs ottheir space so it will be ready when they start being able to
accommodate people overnight," said Weiss.

At su Casa. a social activism and service organization, the group was
able to help rirn a weekly soup kitchen and plan a Halloween party for the
neighborhood children.

“The Halloween party we threw for the neighborhood kids at so cast
was a really run culminating activity," said Weiss. “it was great spending
some time with the kids."

The best part orrhc trip, Weiss said, was seeing how all these service
organizations ditrered in structure and function.

“it was especially interesting to work at the Great Chicago Food Dec
posirory for a day, an organization that receives extremely large amount of
corporate food donations and consolidates them and send them onto other
nonproﬁts," said Weiss.

The group also commuted a lengthy one to two hours to theirworksires,
traveling from the north to the south side orChicago. According to Weiss,
the commute “got to be pretty rircsornc "

, But even with a few mishaps, such as one person getting sick and an.
other losing her wallet, the group had run together and enjoyed the cxpc-
ricncc,

Boys and Girls Club

Minneapolis, Minn.

The trip to the Boys and Girls club was a success, said group leaders
Anna Barlow “04 and Elise Pizzi ‘04.

“We just hung out, played games [and] are really good pizza,” said
Barlow. “It was just a lot of fun."

“We laughed a lot," rrnished Pizzi.

Both were surprised by the size ofthe facility as well as the resources it
provided which included after school homework help for the kids, a com.
mon room, a gym, pool tables, ping pong, foosball and even carpet pool
which became a favorite orspanish Language Assistant Mauricio Arango.

Mauricio loved carpet pool, said Pizzr. He would play it with the
kids and they would sit in lit-re waiting for their turn to play."

The grotip helped the kids with homework, led art protects and helped
build a trail in the city park located behind the facility:

The students were able to talk to the kids and Stress the importance of
continuing their education.

“Brij [Patnaik ‘05) and i ended up talking one day to some ofthc kids
who were thinking about going to college and... letting them see that
they can do it and it can be fun,” said Pizzl. “The main idea... is to give
the kids a role model They dour have anybody who is in college around

The group enjoyed getting to know the kids, who had interesting pcr.
sonalities and life stories.

“There were some really quirky [kids]," said Barlow. “There was one
girl [who] spciit her entire weeks allowance and bought all of us Barbie
necklaces. including the guys. So all of us were Barbie necklaces."

Everyone worked together well, said Barlow and Pizzl, who, finishing
each others sentences, both said they would do it again in a heartbeat.

Nuestm Centre and
the Latino Youth 0r

Chicago, Ill.

The primary goal oftlrc trip to Nucstro centro and the Latino Youth
organization in Chicago's south side was to give inrormntion and advice
to students at alternative high schools and immigrant middle schools about
the importance orcourinuing higher education,

The groundwork to prepare for the trip was difficult, said group leader
Claudia Ochoa ‘04, but well worth it, “We had long days and arduous
preparation for each day, but everyone in the group nicr the challenge,"
she said,

The group worked in places like Highwood, a Chicago suburb, where
the salaries range from $180,000 a person per year to 512.000 a family
per year.

“Many [noncdocumtnted] families were living togcihcr in small apart.
ments because tent was around $1,000 a month, something they couldn't
afford,” said Ochoa.

The group had to travel two hours by train to get to their sites, but
often had many interesting conversations with each other and others on
the train. Tlic long hours were diihcult, but ochoa said the group was
great to work with.

“My favor-ire part about our trip was working with black and Latino
youth and having a wonderrul group that understood the situation." said
Ochoa, ”These students have gone through a lot. lbutl that was no sur-
prise.
