FORTHCOMING DEBATES.

On Monday night, Grinnell's debate squad will again
get under way in the first half of a dual debate with
Cornell. and on Thursday another squad will open a
dual argument with Amcs, both of these debates being
on the home floor. They will be the second and third
of the heaviest debate schedule that Grinnell has under
taken in the last few years.

The argument Monday will be particularly interest—
ing in that it will open up the second topic for discuss-
ion that is being used this year, that being the ques-
tion of disarmament among the nations of the world.
It is also interesting in that it will be the first appears
ancc cf the Grinnell negative team this year

Thursday's debate with Iowa State will bring up
the question of the benefits of advertising in the United
states as it is practiced today. Grinnell’s affirmative
team on that question will again take the firs against

worthy opponents. On February third, the same team
went to bat with the Drake debaters on the same ques
tion and according to popular opinion had the advantage
in the non—decision argument At that time, three men
brought up some brilliant points in favor of the present
advertising system and put them forth in a manner
which was no way boring or tiring to the rather small
group who were present.

The debate squad has put in much time working
up their points and their style. The men rcprcscnt the
fastest talkers in the college, and what is more Inter»
esting than a fast talker going at his best? A good
point well put or a good bit of rcpsrtee will directed is
as good to watch, or rather listen to, as a gentle poke in
the ribs in a basketball game; a good rebuttal is like
a slap in the face.

what should be done about the present advertising
situation in the United states and the disarmament
transactions that are now talring the international
limelight? All students of economics and politics
would find some food for thought in the opinions of thc
debaters who are experts in these fields after their study
of the questions. Incidentally by going to the debates
we will be killing two birds; we will also be supporting
our debate teams which after all deserve our backing.

’ APPLAUSE IN CHAPEL

At the conclusion of the fifth and last of Dr.
Brook's chapel lectures, several visitors unacquainted
with Grinnell traditions applauded the Gates speaker.
The incident served to arouse a discussion, which is
brought up at least once every year, as to the causes
of the unwritten rule forbidding applause in chapel.

There are several reasons which may be cited in
support of this custom. Chapelris fundamentally a Tor
ligious service. It is the purpose of such services to
inspire rather than to entertain. The man on the pul—
pit may be a. reformer. but he is not a perfomer. To
imply. by applauding him. that be has been entertaining
just as an acrobat might be entertaining, is to turn the
chapel service into a performance.

Being a matter of religion. chapel .then, depend upon
on emotional more than upon intellectual response.
The purpose of the hymn preceding the talk, as well
as the short prayer and urgan music following it is
to create a mood. The ability of the service to do this
depehd‘s upon the recaptivity of those participating.
Applause is an indication of a critical attitude which in
turn implies an intellectual restraint placed upon the
audience throughout that prevean it from entering
wholly into the services.

Again, the chapel just as any other ideal religious
service is conducted on a personal note. It has the
atmosphere of an informal family gathering in which
vital problems are thrashed out. Some preachers yield
to this idea so far as to address their congegations as
“My children." If in Hamlet, Lacrtes about to leave
Denmark has responded to his father Palonius' parting
advice. with enthusiastic applause, the result would
have been incongruous. Similarly incongruous would
seem a round of applause gccting the sometimes equally
fathely advice advanced from the chapel pulpit.

Finally. applause recording the degrees of enthus-
iasm felt by the students for particular faculty mem-
bers or their speeches might give t e appearance of a.
yearly faculty marathon for the “ ggest hand." In
many cases the result would be embarrassing.

critical, and focused from a historic
as well as an economic viewpoint.
Shun: Contributes

“The Sniper", a. short Sketch by
Victor Shultz, founder of the Maize-
lnnd press in Des Moines, seems a
distinctively realistic account of the
death of one of these solitary guns
ncrs in the War, drown in with all the
feeling precision of a careful etching.

“Early Spring-Full Moon", a poem
by the wife of Edwin Ford ripcr of
the University of Iowa, is the only
other outside contribution. .Whon
this poem is read once, twice, three
times, there is left happy repetitions
and rhythmic turns of sound, except
for such an abrupt disturbing note
as “past branches”. Pcrbcps in late
March or early April, “Early Spring
Full Moon" might seem poignan .
now, in early February, its mood
somehow does not linger. "Repres-
sions”, the only other verse, by John

 

Perry, is beyond a doubt orthodox
poetic feeling, but. with the possible
exception of the first verse, suffers
from a. lack of poetic expression.

Students \Vrite

“Factory Noon" written by John A.
Spencer, who was graduated here
last year, is for the most part vivid
and immediate; but it remains, in the
last analysis, diffuse, and the sud-
den twist at the end is, through
somewhat presagsd, tartling and ln~
organic.

“Debussy Music" by Aileen Mil-
ligan, a junior at Grinnell last year,
is a. pleasantly writtan exposition of
this composer's unique characteris-
tics. Doubiless to the musician. it
seems elementary and perhaps sup-
erﬂclal, but to the average reader,
who has not known Debussy, it is
an inviting introduction to his ap—
preciaticn.

“Knight of the Dishpan" by Ho-
ward Peck, '29. is no doubt one of
those undergraduate sketches which
have become deplorably unrepresent—
ativc of the writer when they ﬁnally
appear. At any rate, this is the sort

of thing which is generally encourv
aged in a student of composition, but
which is at disadvantage in a consid—
eration with more sophisticated
work.
. Gin—d Successful

The page given to a linoleum cut
but Evelyn Boyd, assistant professor
of English, is sigmihcant as an ex-
tension of the Tanager's role as a
creative stimulus on the campus.
The editorial of this issue. by E,A.A.,
is sound and logical in its presenta~
tion of the "missionary" problem.
The bunk-review section is a repre-
sentative grouping of student and
faculty opinion on current literature,
mostly adequate in its cn'ticism, and
promising in its glimpses of inde<
pendent thinking. ..

Again Mr. Gard must he commend-
ed on his successful piloting of the
Tanager through its adventurous
years to establishment on stable and
recognized ground, Hc has gained
for it by his own efforts a distinc-
tion without which it could not hope
to 'go forward as a more and more
vital expression of creative-minded

 

Grinnell.
