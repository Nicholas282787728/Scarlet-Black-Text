tips Iowa Wesleyan 27-20

by Eric Dahlin and Gordon
Schreiber '

Last Saturday, the Grinnell
Pioneers were able to hold off a
founh quarter rally to defeat Iowa
Wesleyan, 27-20. The victory
evened the Pioneers record at 1-1
and marked Greg Wallace's ﬁrst
win as head coach. The game
saw superb efforts by Grinnell’s
offense and defense with special
teams providing both solid and
sometimes costly play.

The first period was high-
lighted by tough defense from
both teams, the only score com»
ing In the waning seconds of the
quarter. A bad snap on an Iowa
Wesleyan punt gave Grinnell the
ball inside the Iowa Wesleyan IO
yard line Three plays later, Dave
White took the ball in from three
yards out and with a two point
conversion the score was 8-0.
On the ensuing kickoff, Iowa
Wesleyan struck back with Byron
Iennings' return of81 yards for a
touchdown. Their two point
conversion failed and the Pioneers
remained on top 8-6, Later in the
quarter, a crucial third down
scramble by quarterback Jim
Weiand led to a 43 yard scoring
pass from Weiand to freshman
Armando Gilkes. Special teams
gave the Pioneers a Lremondous
boost at 3:45 left in the half
when Paul Leschensky blocked
Mike Howe's punt and Mike
Mohan scooped up the ball and
took it 25 yards for the touch
down. Any Iowa Wesleyan at»
mmpls at scoring before halftime
were quelied by inteceptions by
Ty McGuire and Dwain Desbien.
Grinnell led 21-6 at the half.

In the third quarter, Grinncll's
special teams again came up with
a big play as they foiled a fake
punt by Iowa Wesleyan on their
35 yard line. Unable to put it in
the end zone, the Pioneers settled
for a 22 yard Mohan field goal.
The Pioneer defense caused an-
other turnover latcr in the third
quarter when Rob Boardman lev-
eled the Iowa Wesleyan quarter-

back and Wallace Squibb picked
the ball out of the air and retumod
it to midﬁeld. Despite a 25 yard
run by Dave White, again the
Pioneers had to settle for 3 Mon
han field goal. this one a 30
yardcr. Things became tense in
the fourth quarter when Iowa
Wesleyan scored on a 27 yard run
and then recovered a Grinnell
punt in the end zone after the ball
was punted into~the back of n
Grinnell player. Jeff Shook
helped seal the win when he

Lorimer & Simmons share MVP honors

by Bob Lifton

It ain't nothin' but a thing,
Just show up for a couple of
hours or so, run around a little
(sometimes a lot), and come up
victorious. This about typiﬁes
the last. outing (or shall we say
walkovcr?) for the men's soccer
team, who manhandled the
Monmouth Scots 4-0 on the rain-
filled Wednesday to help keep
their unbeaten streak alive at 570.
Junior foward Austin Simlnons
and sophomore halfback Ian
Lorimer each had a pair of goals
in this, the ﬁrst conference game
of the season. The cake-walk
brought back memories of the
alumni game a few weeks ago.
But hey, who's complainin'7

The Scots were no match for
our number eight Western re-
gionallyaranked Pioneers But
even if the men from Southern
Illinois had all the talent in the
world, they still would have lost
'cause their uniforms were plain
goofy-looking.

Their red and white diamond
tops looked more like the table
clothes at an Italian restuarant or
the putrid color drapes hanging in
an old folks home down in

Florida (you know, the ones sold
in the polycstcrrinfested years of
the late 1970's which emitted
their own unique odor)t They
would have been better off play-
ing in kills.

Surprisingly enough, there
was no score after the first half.
Despite completely dominating
their bad-tempered opponents,
keeping the ball on the Scots'
half of the field with comer kick
after corner kick, the Pioneers
couldn't put the ball in the net,
This "slight" problem has been
Grinnell‘s nemesis all season
long -- luckily the opposition has
failed to capitalize. Before
Wednesday's debacle, the Pioneers
had outscored their opponents 6-
1t Let's hope the second half on-
slaught is an indication of their
offensive prowess in the future.

Lorimer broke the game open
with an unmolested running
header in the front of the goal off
a beautiful cross by halfback
Layne Maly. Soon thereafter,
Lorimer (who is finally playing
at what appears to be 100 percent
after suffering a knee injury) was

Winless no more! Women's soccer outlasts Knox

by Bob Lifton

They finally got over the
hump. The women's soccer team
finally achieved that first victory
that had mysteriously eluded
them for the opening five games
of the season, No matter; they‘re
16 and [lying on cloud 9 after
Wednesday's overtime 372 win
over Knox, and ready to get
things rolling.

Wednesday's water-logged of
fair saw Danielle Aioki score
twice and Jenny Wood once as
the Pioneers slipped past the vis-
iting Siwash. Nobody said it had
to be pretty.

This bitterswcal victory will
help reduce the pain from Grin-
ncll's loss on Sunday to confer-
nce opponent Lake Forest, with
the visitors outshooting the Pio-
neers 22-6. Forget that though:
it‘s time to start fresh.

Grinnell will take their wine
ning streak (mini as it may be, a
streak's a streak) on the road this
weekend as they face St. Benedict
up in Minnesota. 500 is right
around the comcrw

to iowa Wesleyan for their persea

importance of taking advantage of
