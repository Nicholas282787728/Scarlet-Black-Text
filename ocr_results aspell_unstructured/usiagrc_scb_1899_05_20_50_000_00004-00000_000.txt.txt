signatures of Miss Meyer and Miss
McCornaclt. The fourth and last
witness for the state. Miss Brunb
lett. an expert chirographlst. iden-
tiﬁed the handwriting on the card
and the handwriting on ’the sota
pillow. This ended the long and
very conclusive chain or evidence
brought forward by the state.

All these Witnesses were ahly
cross-examined by Attorney Ful-
ton for the defence. The most
startling feature of the ciosssex-
amination was the revelation by
the attorney [or the defence of
testimony by Misses Hand anti
Richards taken before the grand
jury on May 5th. which wasgiosse
ly contradictory to the testimony
just given. This feature was not
as damaging as itgmight have been
because of the law as given by the
judge in her instructions to the
jury that in case ot such discrepr
ancy in testimony the testimony
last given should have most
weight. The prosecution rested
their case here.

The ﬁrst witness sworn by the
defence Miss Meyer. Witness
testiﬁed that she wrote no such
card as she was charged
writing. and that she did notleavc
the house the evening of May 1.

She also tried to account for the
two cards of Mr. Pierce. known
to have been in her possession.
Later in the trial. Witness was
asked by prosecuting attorney to
introduce her two Cards in court;
one of them she handed over. the
other she did not have and when
asked where it was, said she guess.
ed it was in the May basket. This
was a knockout blow to the de-
fence. The second witness, MISS

with

 

McCornaclr. testiﬁed that she
knew llollliilgabout Miss Kyle’s

was then sworn and corroborated
MISS McCornaclt‘s testimony to
the cﬁect that they were not near
Miss Kyle's home on the evening
or May 1. Nothing ot illlpore
tance was brought out by the
cl‘ 5 . examination, Theie tee
mained only the pleas ot the at
torneys and Judge Millerd'sln-
structions to the jury. and the
famous and sensational trial of
the State of Iowa vs Margaret
McCormick. et ul. was ended. The
verdict of the jury was awaited in
breathless suspcnse. In spite of
the extremely able work of the
delendant’s attorneys. it was gen-
erally felt that a verdict would be
ieturned lor the state. When
the jury crime in, foreman Petit
handed the verdict to the clerk.
lt read guilty for Miss Meyer.
not guilty for Miss McCornack.
The Judge pronounced sentence
of six months imprisonment and
a ﬁne of Sluo, sentence to be hcltl

Now occurred one of the most
sensational events that Calocaga—
thia court has witnessed in many
yCars. Miss Knox and the two
most important witnesses lor the
prosecution. Miss Hand and Miss
Richards. approached the judges
and tremblingly confessed the
whole crime. Thus in Caiocagae
