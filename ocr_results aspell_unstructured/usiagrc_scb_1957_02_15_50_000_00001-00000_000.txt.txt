Ten Wiih Low Grade-Point‘s
Dismissed By Commii’ree

“The Committee on Academic Standing will review the
records of any student; whose semester or cumulative grade-
point average falls below 2.00 . . . any student whose grades

decline noticeably during the

semester may be required to

leave the college before the end of the semester.”

Dean R, Homer Norton,
on Academic standing. announc-
ed in a recent interview that due
to the above regulations, which
are listed in the college student
Handbook, 10 students have been
asked to leave the college be-
cause of low ,scholarship.

Norton stated that the to
students had had three semes-
ters in which to raise their
scholastic average, but that
they had remained well below
the required cumulative gnde
point, and had lost any reas-
onable opportunity for gradu—
ation.

In referring to the 2.00 cumu—

chairman of the Committee

lative average, Norton said that
it was “worked out on the basis
of what was possible for the
students to have as an average
and still graduate. Regarding
people below the required level,
the Committee
Standing felt that ii. would not
be fair to the students, to their
parents and to the college to let
the students under consideration
continue to struggle against im»
possible odds and suitor the ac-

companying frustration." Norton
