Softball goes out
in style, upsets IC

Pioneers split—and nearly sweep—playoff-
bound Illinois College on Senior Day at home

av KEVIN BVRNE
The Pioneer softball team had little
to play tor in their twin bill ﬁnale last
Saturday, but that didn't seem to pre
vent them from coming out as if they

had something to prove. It was Senior '

Day on Grinncll's home diamond, as
the Pioneers faced Illinois College, a
team that has already secured a spot
in the 2005 Softball Championships.
Lone senior Annie Bearnnn put her
stamp on the first game by hitting a
gamerwinning sacriﬁce fly in the bot
tom of the fifth. Grinnell swiped the
first game 4-3, but a late comeback by
Illinois coucgc prevented the home
team from picking up the sweep. Grll‘l’
nell led 5-3 in the last inning, but the
Lady Blues plated three runs to win,

“It felt so great to play well in the
last two games," said Beaman.“We were
all energized, and everything seemed to
come together Moments like that in
softball are exactly whyl love playing so
much, and I had almost forgotten what
it feels like to be playing in that kind
or game. All of the pitchers threw ﬁre,
the defense was strong behind them,
and our bats were contagious all day. In
the second game when we pulled ahead
in the top ofthc 7(h,l was completely
thrilled. Even though Illinois College
came through with hits to win it, I still
think we played great on Saturday, and
I walked away feeling as good as itwe
had won them both.”

Beaman finished the day 4-for-5
with four RBl’s, and along with Karyn
Wieland ‘06, who also went 4efor75,
the hot bats were backed up by some

solid pitching performances in both
contests. Emily Kolbc ‘07 picked up her
sixth win of the season in the opener
after working 3 1/3 innings in relief of
starter Lee Anne Steinberg ‘07, Kolbe
allowed just one run on four hits, to go
with a strikeout and three walks. Head
Coach Tom Sonnichsen knew how im-
portant it was for his team to finally
win one ofthe many tough games they
have battled in all season.

“1C had a very productive season,"
said Sonnichsen, “but they were just
one of the strong teams we played.
Playing good teams and losing is still
losing. Playing good teams and win—
ning is what brings satisfaction."

The focus for the softball team now
shifts toward next season, as they return
every player except for their team lead-
cr, Beaman. The starters next year will
have another season of experience to
play with, and will enter the campaign
knowing they can beat the best in their
conference.

“Ending the season with two good
efforts will leave us hungry to get back
at it next season," said Sonnichsen.
“Each ofour returning players has been
in the heat of battle and will know
what to expect. Losing Annie Beaman
will change the experience level or our
team, but I think recruiting has gone
welltand next year’s team will be very
strong. Scheduling looms ahead and
you never know how challenging the
season will be until the schedule is in
place. Whatever the challenges that lie
ahead this group otplnycrs will be eager
to meet them.”

Tennis
wins it
all, again

Men’s tennis wins its second
straight MWC title, and third'
in fourth years, in domination
fashion in Madison, Wis.

ev EMANUEL ANDRAS

The men's tennis team made history last weekend
at the 2005 Midwest Conference Championships in
Madison,Wis., capping offits successful 2005 league
play with the 2005 MWC crown. In doing so, the
team won its third such Championship in the last
four years. Prior to 2002, the squad had not captured
the MWC title since 1961,

“It was really gratifying to win a secondrstmight
conference title," said head coach Andy Hamilton.
“ B a c it - t o -
back 20-win
seasons speak
volumesabout
the overall
strength of
our program"

The Pk)’
neers went
into the three—
day eventwith
high expecta-
tions, having
played and
beaten each team in the league this season.The squad,
seeded ﬁrst in the South Division, defeated St. Nor-
bert in the semiﬁnal round 471. This victory moved
them to the championship round,in which they faced
archiival Ripon. Grinnell emerged victorious against
the Red Hawks also, ngain by a 4-1 score.

“Throughout my four years here, Grinnell has had
a not entirely friendly rivalry with Ripon," said team
captain and lone senior Brij Patnaik ‘05, “and it has
been nice to start coloring that relationship with some
athletic contempt."

At singles play, three of the top six Grinnell plays
ers captured individual titles. In a grueling match, Eli
Best ‘07 defeated Dave Czarnecki of Ripon 7-6 (8-6),
672 to capture the no.2 single title, while Kushal Shah
captured the no. 5 singles title with a 674, 6—1 win
over Ripon's Alex Wente. Finally, with the no. 6 sins
gles crown at stake, DJ. Warden ‘08 overcame Knox's
Josh Motcn 6-1, 6-4.

Hamilton highlighted Best's play.

“For Eli to win another title at No. 2 singles is
an example of both his ability and competitiveness,”
said Hamilton. “In two years he has carved out nearly
forty wins."

On the doubles Side,twhieh has been a decidedly
weak factor of llieir game throughout the season, the
Pioneers managed to put on an impressive show.The
combo of Rick Fenbert ‘06 and DJ. Warden ‘08 caps
tilted the no.2 doubles crown with their 6~2, 670 de
feat etMonmonth's Matt Moser and Jimmy Jordan.
Last year’s winners, Kushal Shah ‘06 and Eric Ohrn
‘07, teamed together again to successfully defend their
no. 3 doubles title.They stopped Jon Betts and Steve
Pctrovich of Knox with a score ore-2, 7-6 (7-5).

"A secondestraight title at no. 3 doubles for Kushal
Shah and Eric Ohm capped a great run for our indie
viduals in the MWC," Hamilton said.“In the last two
weeks of the season these guys were really on top or
their games,"

“On the whole the weekend was a huge success,
but we [had] very high expectations, so it [was] hard
to swallow any losses,"said Best,“We took care ofthe
team competition easily and that’s always the main
goal.” .

”0n the whole the weekend was
