“Something will have to he done
ahout it," said a Senior nlau, rel'crring
to the noise in tile Y. M. C. A during
the Friday chapel service. it some or
the men want to s ay ill the building
during the chapel hour they might at
least 'cut out’ unnecessary noise, as a
matter or courtesy to those who dare
cure [or the service it lur no other
reason."

One oi the Junior g exclaimed

inrliannntly the other (1213. “I think,
that it Sllo\\s lach oi courtesy iol any.
one to come in and sit in the scat ne. t
the aisle so that anyone else is obliged
to squeeze past. The seats on the his
side are inst as good and it is much
more convenient for those who come
in a little late to sit on the end. ii
little matters at iorrn such as th' and
waiting for the row ahead to pass ﬁrst,
were careiully observed, the chapel
service would he much more orderly
and digniﬁed.”

“i cannot s y that i get very lunch

now,” said a senior man. “It seems to
me that the exercises are too mechan.
ical to he really hcuehcial. One does
not thinlr oi the meaning oi the scrip
ture passages in the responsive read.
lug because he is licilt hnsy watching
ior his turn to come, The scripture
lesson too, is liable to make very little
impression because it is read without
comment, and it has been heard so
oiten that it ceases to mane one thinlr
about its real significance. What we
need in our chapel exercises is some
one that, u hieh we can carry with us
during the day. This would make the
service more helpiui, and thus I be.
lieve the attendance would he in-
creased, It the time taken tor the re.
sponsive reading was used tor a short
talk, I believe the chapel service
would be improved."

"The importance or the chapel ser.
vice as a unifying element in our col-
lege liie cannot be over-estimated,”
said a Junior recently, “and i din glad
that the attention at the student body
has been called to this (act. The very
essence of otll'ﬁuucllwzmnted "Grinllell

good out of the chapel service as it is'

class room. It is impossible to get the
real good ironi a lecture, nor the iull
force or the salient points it one is
obliged to write tllc whole llollr. In
all lny college course so i’ar l have only
had one professor who advised the
class to 1 ton to the lecture and let
the notes :0. Most of thcni are de-
lightcd ii the students scribble lir.
dustriously all the time they are talk.
illg. Many times one is apt to write
down a wrong statement, in his hurry,
or it may have been mi. understood;
hilt he is held responsible for that
lecture, and lie is liable to have
trouble later. This incessant writing
does not glve the student time to
think."

Sneaking of the dance last wcclr one
of the Senior girls said: "I think it
has come to the place here in Grin.
nell, where the college must allow
dancing, or stop it altogether. There
are always smile people who must be
told that they cannot do certain things
before they will pay ittentlon to the
prevailing sentiment in the matter. i
believe if it was put to the vote or the
student body here in Grinuell, that
dancing would he tahuoerl, I think
that the dances should be stopped nl.
together. because it is putting tempta.
tion too strong in the way ol the
Fl'eslllnml. For one who has been used
to dancing. it is hard to resist the
chancc merely because a college tva
dition says that one must not do it."

The girls or the college have shown
much interest in the gymnasium wor-
lh' fall, With iew exceptions, every
girl in school is enrolled ill some grin.
nasium class, and the Work promises
to he of a higher order than that done
last year.

The outdoor work was finished last
week, closing with the tennis tourna.
nicnt. Edith Maybe, '12, and Rlltll
Brownell, ’13, contended tor the chains

going to Miss Maybe. The scores were
7.9, 6-4. 11-9.

The Seniors, Olive Leyenherger and
Florence Miller, won the championship
