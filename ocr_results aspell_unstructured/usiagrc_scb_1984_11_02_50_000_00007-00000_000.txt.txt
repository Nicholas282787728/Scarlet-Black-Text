The race for Iowa: a tragic-comedy

by Roswell P. Quigley

Those or you who haven‘t been
hiberating in the science building
are probably already aware of
what I am about to tell you. On
November 6th, elections are going
to be held across the country.
What you many not know is the
ditierence between a county
auditor and a clerk of district
court. Such ignorance is ex—
cusable, people in the 13-24 age
bracket aren't supposed to care
anyway. ‘

Two years ago I voted in the
local races. That is not to say that
I made any logicial choices. fl‘he
Democratic ticket featured
three women, I considered

“myself a liberal, so 1 pulled the
., lever marked “1)".

This year. since the big boys
and girl are running, those of us
who do not vote absentee will find
ourselves at Fairview School
pondering names we know
nothing about. I hope to give you
some glimmer of hope when faced
with the cornucopia oi cornieed
politicians. Welcome to the air
ficial Boswell P. Quigley's Cams

. ,paign.’M Review.

First 0“. DON’T just vote the
straight liberal ticket. In the race
for county auditor. Jo Wray, the
Republican incumbent. is pitted
against Chris McAninch, the in-
visible Democrat. McAninch, who
is running tor the job “to gain ex
perience in the workings at local
government", hasn't made a can
certed eiiort to campaign. He
does have experience at setting up
alcohol refineries however, so we
may want him as a Convocation
speaker sometime. Wray is a
capable auditor and wears
glasses. She gets my vote.

4¥¥¥44¥¥¥¥¥4¥¥¥¥¥4 Nov.

Eldon Shook is the Independent
candiate [or sheriff. He brings to
the race a total at 4 years and 3
months experience as a
Montezuma city police Office.
Max Allen. who has never
bothered me or you, has a mere 29
years in law enforcement. Allen is
a strightsshﬂober who served in
Korea long before he became
sheritl'. What’s the point of all this
you may ask? I’ll tell you. l don’t
know. but vote for Allen even if he
is a Republican. He isn’t really
Comfortable with politics which
makes him my choice.

For the remainder oi the races,
vote with your party. it you hapr
pen to be a Republican, defect. Go
ahead, nobody's watching
anyway. '

Roger .lepsen, the Republican
senator from Iowa, is involved in
a disgusting and dirty political
light with Tom i-iarkin, his
Democratic opponent. Harkin
didn't really _rly tighter missions
over Vietnam and Jepsen wasn't
really a foot Soldier in World War
II. Jepsen liked to get quas-
tionable massages beiore he was
“born-again" and Harkin is a
dyed-in-the-wool liberal who per-
sonally opposes abortion. If you
like Jepsen even though he voted
ior nervergas production and the
MX missile. then I’ll remind you
that he drives alone in D.C. car—
pool lanes. Vote (or Harkin, he has
a neat cleft in his chin.

The race for the Third District
US. Representative is a little less
clear out than some might think.

Joe Johnston, who could put any
audience asleep irom a podium, is
challenging incumbent Cooper
Evans for the 3rd Distict U.S.
House seat. I would initially vote
[or Evans ia Republican) just as a

reward for his more moderate st-
,vle from two years ago. I was
almost tooled until i saw a quota-
tion lrom Evans to the effect that
the rich ln America have been
shouldering too much DI the tax
burden and the poor should start
paying more of their [air share.
Johnston, who is a lawyer,
nonetheless would probably
disagree. My vote goes with
Johnston on moral grounds.

For the State Representative to
the 53rd District, Phil Tyrrell of
North English, laws. is challeng»
ing Janet Carl [mm Grinnell.
She‘s a Democrat and he's a
Republican. He‘s a conservative
insurance salesman who wants to
crackdown on Crime. She‘s a
liberal who voted against the 21
yearold drinking age. He reminds
me of my father, she talks in
academic style run-on sentences.
Make up your own mind on this
one.

Probably the most important
race in the eyes or the college
community has to be that for
board of supervisors. Danny Car-
roll tRep.) who used to be a
carpenter for BSrG is running
against Grover Loitin (Dem.) who
probably can handle a hammer
himself. Loftin was a Prisonerols
War during WWII and Carroll
runs a Christian school so they
both have done a lot oi praying.
They are both nice guys and look
swell in a suit. I'll vote for Lottin
though, because his first name is
Grover.

If you still aren't enlightened
don't despair. Just cast your
presidential ballot lor Gerald
Baker and Ferris Alger. They best
capture me essence oi the '34
political scene with their party,
the BIG DEAL PARTY.

Mondale and Ferraro are often

ministration that would champion
the rights at its people; a country
that works hard. plays by the
rules and treats every one of its
citizens iairly.

Mr. Reagan, while campaign-
ing. enjoys telling a story about
an Italian immigrant's son who
became a surgeon and saved the
life of a President in March of
1981.

That surgeon. Dr. Joseph Gior-
dano ~ head of the trauma unit at
George Washington University
Hospital in Washington. Dc.
wrote an article. In it he said:
"Mr. President. you only tell part
at the story. Yes. my parents
sacrificed for me, But I was also
helped through college by low-
interest federal student loans.

“Yes, I saved your life, and l
was proud to do it. But the
