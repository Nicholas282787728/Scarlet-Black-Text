‘ ’
Local Women s Caucus Formed

by netsy cilman
Grinnell's chapter of the Iowa W0»
men’s Political Caucus was born
Thursday, November 29 in South
Lounge. The organizational meet-
ing got Off to a start following
a presentation by Roxanne B. Con-
lin, slate chairperson of the Can
lin, state chairperson of the Cau-
cus. , ‘

Conlin, Assist»
ant State Attorn»
ey Generalfor C »
vii Rights, was e1»
ected state chair-
person atthe Cau- ~ _ _
cus’ first stale- (:0th
wide convention held in September
of this year. She pointed out at the
meeting that the Caucus has already
had some substantial successes,al»
though it is so young, For example,
16 Di the 17 candidates backed by
the Caucus in local elections won
for city and county offices.

The Women’s Political Caucus,
founded on a nation»wide basis in
1971, is concerned with using the
political process to improve the
lives of women. The Caucus encour-
ages women to run for public office
and provides them with advice to
help them win.

on January 11 and 12, the Caucus
is sponsoring a workshop entitled
"SO You Want to Run for Office,”
in Des Moines. At the conference
women will be given insights into
the mechanics of the election pro-
cess.

“Just getting women into the leg»
islature,” Conlin observed, “makes
it harder for male legislators to
ignor their needs." However, Con»
lin stated that the Caucus will not

back women simply because oltheir
sex if they are not qualified can»
didates or are unresponsive to Can-
cus ideals. For example, in the last
election, the organization supported
a male candidate over afemale can-
didate because the man's position
was closer to that of the Caucus.

When supporting a candidate the
group must make sure that the can»
didate is responsioe to the human
equality issue and Supports the in-
volvement of women in the decision-
making positions of his/her staff
with equal pay.

The Caucus’ second method ofop—
eration is to act as a lobby for wo-
men's concerns, according lo Con-
liu. One of the current projects
involves the revision of the crim»
inal laws regarding rape. lowa law
still requires that a woman’s iden»
tiﬁcation of a rapist be corrabora»
ted by two witnesses.

“As it stands now, a woman’s
word is not to be trusted before
the law," Conlin emphasized. “We
think this has to go.” Although
actual statistics are not yet avail»
able, Conlin said that she thinks
only one out of ten rape cases
end in a conviction.

Another Caucus project is an inves—
tigation of educational materials
being used in the public schools
throughout the state. Oiten children
are taught to read from hooks which
represent girls as being incapable
and inferior to boys as well as be-
ing very docile, following the leads
of their elder (“the boys are al-
ways older”), capable and moread-
venturous brothers, said Couliu.

"You can't tell me, she said, ”that
children don’t learn a lot more from
that than how to read,"

School physical education progr-
ams are also being looked info.
All too often, Conlin said, these
programs are also being lookedinto.
programs are based on the assump»
tion that "women’s bodies do no
more lhan please men. I’m not
saying that every girl should bea
football player, but it is time that
we start giving more emphasis to
physical fitness for women. And
those that want to play football—--
fine,H she added.

A third realm of action involves
a follow»up study of the new di-
vorce laws. Iowa has recently put
into effect a no»contest no fault
divorce law. Members of the Cau—
cus, according to Conlin, suspect
that the legislation is having eff~
ects not anticipated by its backers.
Child support payments may be as
low as $12 a week. Conlin cited
the case of women who have not
held jobs outside the home for a
long time.

"When they get a divorce, they
are in effect, out of a job and un»
trained for any other occupation,"
she stated. "Something has to be
done for them.”

The new Grinnell chapter of the
Caucus hopes to continue these st-
udies on a local level, as well
as work for the election of quali»
fied candidates to the schoolmard,
city council, county Board of Sup»
ervisors and other positions.
Officers elected at Thursday's
meeting include: president, Kay Jore
dan; vice president, Chris Ryan;
treasurer, Norma Santee; Treasu»
rer, Karen Connally. The first sch-
eduled meeting will be in early
February. More concrete plans will
be made then.

Women’s Athletic Program Established

by Dave Scnechter
The proposal to equalize the status
of Grinnell’s women’s athletics pro»
gram passed the laculty Monday by
a vote of 56»1, The program att—
empts to upgrade the women’s pro~

gram and to put it in the same
form as the men’s intercollegiate
program.

tenance for facilities, approved sc~

women, were the Issues raised in
the proposal. The proposal was
formulated by Sandra Holh, one
of the women’s coaches, who esti»
mates that more than the present
50-60 women will participate when
the new program goes into effect
next year.

Need for an expanded women’s ath»
letic program at Grinnell has been
shown by the increased interest
in women's athletics. However, the
old “play»day” style of program,
has been outgrown and is useless
now, according to Both. The propo—
sed budget for women’s programs
is subject to review and if approv-
ed will go into effect next year.

Hoth hopes that the women’s pro-
gram will be expanded from its pre-
sent four sports to apossible ten,
depending on interest. other con-
siderations in the proposal were
that more women athletes be sou~
ght, that publicity for women‘s ath»
letics be moved to a greater level,
and that the facilities used by the
women be kept up.

Fees to Ri

Tuition and fees will increase by
a total of $220 for the 197445
academic year at Grinnell, it was
announced Monday. The new total
will be $4270.

President Glenn Leggett said 3170
of the increase will be in the year-
ly tuition, while 550 is in the board
fee. The latter increase (of $25 per
semester) had already been ann-
ounced, and will go into effect for
the second semester of the 197371
academic year.

in a letter to parents of Grinnell
students, Leggett explained that the
new fees “reflect the Trustees'
long»standing policy that two-thirds
or more of the actual educational
cost should be borne by tuition and
fees.”

Leggett noted Monday that the Col»
lege’s budget continues to be in ba-
lance and this its endowment has
improved over the past several
years'. However, he added, the fee
increase has become mandatorybe—
cause of the need to improve fac—
ulty salaries coupled with inflat»
ionary rises in other costs.

Grinnell's comprehensive fees
have risen almost $1000 since the
1969-70 academic year. At that
time, tuition and fees totaled $2400
with room and board 3875. The
following years, whosecharges rose
to $2615 and $900 respectively.

For the 1971-72 academic year,
the charges rose again, with tui»
tion and fees totalling $2760 and
room and board equalling $940.
In 1972, the fees for the next year
were again raised, to $2890 for
tuition and fees and $960 for room

SGA Discuss Evaluation

by John Turnbull

There wasn't much to get excited
about concerning this week's meet-
ing of the Joint Boards. Significant»
ly, none of the few members pre»
sent seemed too enthused about
it either. They did, however, stay
around long enough to listen to
reports.

Most oi the meeting revolved ar-
aund this semester’s worth of fa»
culiy evaluation booklets and the
prospects for next year’s edition.
It was somewhat sheepishly admit»
ted by Scott Weil that the budget
was sort of over~extended due to
peculiarities of the last minute pub-
lication process.

After getting the first section of the

booklet printed for $150, the book»
let's editors were forced to spend
$744 for the second half. The extra
expense came about because of hav—
ing to have that section printed by
a private company, the College Ser-
vice Bureau not promising anything
before March.

After giving an uncontested $200
to Jack Doppelt for his work as
editor, the year’s fund of $1000 had
dwindled to a mere $156 (including
$300 in revenue). That is all next
semester's ca—editors Marc Gener-
eux and Lynn Nuber have to work _
with at the moment. Their budget
should be rounded out next year
as more ideas about the booklet
are considered.

and board.

This year, tuition and fees broke
the $3,000 mark for the lirst time
in College history, totalling 33090.
Room and Board presently totals
$935.

in Line

Leggett stresses that the Grin»
nell increases are in line with
increases at comparable institu»
tions. He notes that increases at
some East Coast colleges have to»
lalled $500 for next year.

College ofﬁcials say that ”E fee
increases will be taken into account
when financial aid awards are pre»
pared for next year.

Dean of Admissions and Student
Financial Aid D. Nicholas Ryan
noted Thursday that, "Dean Walk—
er and I ignore the financial res—
traints of the College when setting
the financial aid budget for return-
ing students. The College's policy
is to meet the financial needs of
the currently enrolled ﬁnancial aid
recipients and then determine a
realistic financial aid budget for
new students.

“when the Trustees increase the
comprehensive fee (as they have
14 of the 15 years 1 have been
here) we increase the financial aid
of many students."

Ryan added that the financial cir—
cumstances of every family are re-
viewed anuually, with charges in aid
made according to any major cha»
nges in linancial condition.

Leggett says that next year’s Col-
lege operating budget will increase
by a projected 6.5 per cent, but
that the fee increase is being held
to 5.4 per cent. The resulting tie-
ficit will be raised from sources
other than student charges, “a fan-
cy way olsaying endowment income”
he told Grinnell’s faculty.

The latest increase is the second
largest lump-sum rise since 1569.
The largest single raise, $240, went
into effect for the 1970—71 acade-
mic year.
