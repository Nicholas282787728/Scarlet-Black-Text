Switching suddenly trom business in

speaker declared that insurance was
the basis or all modern business as it
is based on credit primarily. "It is a
young man's business, and young men
nm it,” said Mr. Evans, who then went
on to say that the older men in the in—
surance business were being pcusioned
all to make room for young men who
are the lite or a business orgauiz
