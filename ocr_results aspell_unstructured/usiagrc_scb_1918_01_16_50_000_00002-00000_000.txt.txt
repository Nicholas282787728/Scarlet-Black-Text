THE RIGHT START!

Few basketball sedsonsvhave started
more ausipiciousiy than the 1918 sea-
son opened by the Carleton contest
Monday evening.

While the game was won by the
closest margin. and while the scar-
let‘s playing was a bit ragged at times,
the most noticeable things were the
FIGHT displayed by the Grinnell men
from the opening oi the game, and the
support given by the crowd. Basket-
ball enthusiasm oi the highest type.
the type that DEMANDS victory and
will not be content with detoat. was

- shown thruout the game.

We must keep that spirit We have
an attractive schedule, and we have a
team that can win.

Drakc is next!

“CHUCK"

Grinncll has been proud oi Charles
Hoyt from the day he Joined the scar-
lct and black squad. Every honor
that he has won has been an honor
ior Grinnell.

' We have been proud oi him as an
athelcte; we have been proud oi him
as a man. Now. his name will bc
placed even higher on the records. ior
he has joined that grcat body oi Gr

nellicns who have given up their tenr
porary ambitions and personal inter~
ests to serve the nation and the world.

“Chuck” has had to give us his last
year oi college athletics, the year that
would mean the most to him. perhaps.
oi any. But he has done it without
ostentation. and with no desire ior
praise. .

Atlllctically. Gl‘inuell suitors a se-
verc loss by the enlistment oi Hoyt.
But the loss will he cheeriully accept-
ed. with the knowledge that Grinnell
is playing an even bigger part in the
war.

DINNER PARTIES

Iniormal dinner parties are a desir
able icature oi Grinnell's social liic.
They make it possible tor college men
and women to meet and get acquaint-
ed on natural and normal grounds.

An increase in the number oi such
parties would he oi considerable ad
vantage. Too many college men are
’only slightly acquainted with Grinnell
girls. and only a tow oi the latter are
known by representative groups oi
Grinnell men.

The idea suggcsted by Mrs. Louise
Tracr oi making it possible tor every
Quadrangle girl to dine at least once
at thc men's dormitories. and every
man to attend at least one dinncr at.
the Quadranglc. is most excellent.
We believe its adoption would tend to
solve ono oi the problems growing out
or Grinnell's separate liic tor the men
and the women.

We would. however, makc one
change in the present dinnerspnrty
system. A charge oi hity cents a

TIIE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

plate {or OVGI'l' guest from the other
college (lllllngrl‘oolli is neither llecnsr
sill‘y nor desirable. When a mail has
paid for his dinner at the men's dot»
iiiitnrics it is haidly lair to chargc his
ho. css at tho Quadrangle ﬁlly cents
for the some dinner.

Sonic charge. as Mrs. Tracr pointed
out. is justiﬁable because oi the botlicr
and cxtra waiter service necessitated
by parties. But that charge should be
low enough to encourage more (lino
ucrs.

The question is not one that should
be left to thc dormitory ﬁnance coin-
niittcc alone It concerns the dean at
women. and both the men’s and the
women's selfrgoverniug hoards,

CLIQUE SPIRIT 0R HOUSE SPIRIT?

The mere mention oi thc word
"club-room" on that area oi ground
located north oi Eighth avenue and
east oi Park street is a signal tor the
near extermination ot the brave indie
yidual unwise enough to mention it.
The subject oi clllbai'ooms in general
and club-mums in particular has been
discusscd many times. by many indi-
viduals. ironi many viewpoints. but
usually with the same result, the
rooms themselves have been conﬁned
to many stages oi nerdition cm'l'ea
sponding to their present usctulness
and completeness.

When college opened in September.
it was authoritatively stated that the
clllbrmollls would be ready in two
weeks. or a month "at the latest."
Time dragged. Every third wcck one
day would he spent in working on the
club-rooms. Finally they were conr
pleted to all external appearances.
But they wore kept locked— the im-
niturc hadn’t arrived."

The men went home ior Christmas
vacation ﬁrmly believing what they
had been (oldithat the rooms would
be ready for them when they returned
alter vacation. But on January 3d
they discovered that the rooms were
as heiorc with the exception oi some
new wall decorations. and with the
doors locked securely.

Enough iorniture is now stored in
one oi the club-rooms to ﬁt them all
up ior temporary use, Several oi the
rugs are here, This is the time oi
year when the cluh-roonis would be
most used—these long evenings and
blizzardy Sunday aiternoons would
make iellowship around the ﬁreplaces
big addition to the liie in the dormi»
tories.

Opening the club bonus is not pai»
tioularly necessary irom a physical
point oi view. The men have more
and pleasantcr quarters now than
they have ever had beiore in Gl‘innell.
They as individuals have no great
need oi the club-rooms.

But the club-moms are needed. andY

must be developed now while the din-s

Looking Afhti' College Men

Even though their sons help in mo-
mentary danger on the battle line in
France. there is a grain of comfort for
anxious parents if they can feel that
they are within cable touch or their
loved ones. Through the University
Union in Paris. thc ininilics oi college
boys at the front can receive within

twclltyAfolli' hours detailed statements‘

Everyone knows better than to urge
men to go to our “'"l meetings. Such
ciioii merely elicits witty sarcasm
iroid tho keeirniindcd, or snccrs ironi
the less wise uho “take p ide in being
rough-necks." Those icw who attend
these meetings are not religious or
any better than the rest oi usitlley
are merely wiser. and more loyal to
Grinnell. For thc Y. whcthci we
realize it or not. is a t tal part oi our
college. Without it the Gl'lullcll spirit
would be nothing but u-ind.

We cannot be loyal to Grillncll with
out helping to suppoit hcr vital Insti—
tutions. And is there any other way
in which we can Show as great ser
ousncss and loyalty with as little at
tort as to attend these weekly meets
lugs? Gl'illllcll should have nothing
short oi the best. and here is an up»
poi-trinity ior everyone to scrvc to thai
end.

Aiter asking a ieculty member to go
to the trouble or preparing a good
speech, meeting him at the y. M. with
a puny audience, seems cruolly thnnio
less, Students have an opportunity to
come into closizl' touch with the titer
ulty men at the r it. than they do at
chapel or iii the classroom, Profes~
sor Lilvell's healtsmslleill't talk with
the men at the last meeting was worth
far more than anvoue oi his interest-
ing. but necessarily impersonal. his»
tory lectures.

Thereiore, not only do we oue it to
the college and the speakers to attend
these meetings. but wc also owe it to
ourselves. Realizuig this, we must re-
spond. A Common Student.

Is it Ktccssuryl
“Ii war is what Sherman said it was.
tell me what is Sunday lunch?” iran-
tically asked a dweller in the dermis
torios after the repast oi last Sunday
evening. There was no answer, as
words were entirely incapable of ex-
pressing the situation.
How much right we have to object.
I do not ieel justiﬁed in saying. but
this was the menu: Toast with cheese
dressing and ginger bread. and in order
that no injustice shall be done, we must
not target to mention the water, which
was oi a good brand and very palat-
able. It has been said that no one
suﬂel‘eth unto himself. and according-
ly a dozen visiting Drake co-eds
dropped in to help us enjoy our feast.
Ii we arc dciying the tood adminis-
tration and giving the kaiser occasion
to ordor an arch oi triumph, iar be it
trom us to open our mouths on this
subject. However. we are by no means
iconvinccd that iood is so scarce that
we must starve ourselves in order ta
win the war. A Regular Boarder.

A Correction

Ill justice to the young ladies and
to thc collogc band, I wish to correct.
thru your columns, the erroneous imr
pressicn created by an article in your
last sue. stating that “Because of a
scarcity of men the college band inem~
bcrs have asked the girls to assist."
This statement is written without
t'oiindatiou. as the young ladies were
admitted upon their musical ability
alone.

Notwithstanding the fact that ten
members have joined the colors in ya-
i-iuus branches oi semce. and that a
number have inund a “pressure of

the band. the organization is still In-
tact. We have played [or all the pep
