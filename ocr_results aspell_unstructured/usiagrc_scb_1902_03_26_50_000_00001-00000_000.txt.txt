THE MADISON MEET.

Wisconsin Wins First Placc‘Grinncll
and Illinois Tic ior Sccond—Wallcscr
is Grinncll's Best Man.

Although several schools which
had been expected iailcd to ap-
pear, the gymnasium contest at
Madison was highly satisiaciory
to the representatives ironi Grin
nell. Chicago, Michigan North-
western. Purdue and Minnesota
had all promised to send teams,
but llllnois, Beloit and Grinnell
were the only schools which actu-
ally did. Gtinnell and Illinois
each had a team of [our men.
while Beloit represented
, in a special event only.

As had been expected the meet
was won by Wisconsin, her team
gaining thirty-two points. the re»
niainiiig twenty two being equally
divided between Griunell and
Illinois. Tlle individual chant-
pionship was won by Brown of
Wisconsin with a total of twelve
points. \lValleser came next with
eleven to his credit, all of Grin-
nell‘s points being made by hint.
He took ﬁrst place on the rings
and second on the horizontal and
in tumbling. Twelve beautiinl
silver cups were awarded to wine
nets oi Fllst and second places.
and oithese \Nalleser captured
three, the largest number awarded
to any One man.

By virtue oi their participation
in this meet Beloit. Wisconsin,
Illinois and Grinncll become the
charter members of the Western
intercollegiate Gymnasium Assoc
ciation. Its ofﬁcers (or the next
year are: Director Elsom, of
Wisconsin, president; Walleser.
of Griniicll, vice president; and
DirectorKrackenbaum,oilllinois,
secretary. As yet the association
is controlled by the various gym-
nasium dilectors, but it may be
put under student control later.

The meet next year will he
held at the University of Illinois
at Champaign, and no doubt a
much larger number oi schools
will participate, By a provision
of the constitution visiting teams
may hcreafter take their own apr
paratus with them. This is a do
sirablc provision as the difference
in apparatus, especially the horse,
had much to do in reducing Grin-
nell’s score Saturday evening.

NO GAME thH IOWA

!o\va Refuses to Play Football in Grin-
nell ——No Dual Meet With Iowa
in the Spring.

The statement that Iowa and
Griiiricll will not meet on the gl’ldr
non this iall comes as a great stir
prise and a decided disappoint»
merit to all friends of athletics
throughout the state, On the
surface, thcrc is no cause for this
suspension of athletic relations,
but owing to the position taltcn by
Iowa's manager, such. a result was
unavoidable, The situation is
orieiiy.tliis: Up to year before
last it had been the custom for
Iowa and Grinnell to alternate
their games between Iowa City
and Grinncll. In 1900. owingto
the ﬁnancial situation it was olel
cided tortcmporarily discorltiniie
this alternation and play the game
where titi: most
money could be made. but with
the distinct understanding that
no precedent was to be establish-
ed and the old system could be
reverted to at any time. Last
year's game was played at Iowa
City and early this season Mana-
ger Dicl~inson thought that in all
probability the game this coming
fall would occur at the same place.
As the schedule materialized it
became evident that the game
this year could he played here
and ought to be played here as
no other important game was
scheduled here and the students
were beginning to demand the
playing oi a game with lowa on
the home grounds. Iowa's mana-
ger was informed to that eiiect
but refused to consider the trans
fer of the game to Grinnell. As
the contract for the game had
not been signed, the Grinnell
board of control instructed the
manager to schedule the game at
Grinncll. or not at all. Mr. Mc-
ciitchen's reason for not Comlng
to Grinncll is that Iowa has two
heavy trips and cannot stand the
short trip to Grinnell. He also
iniormed Manager Dickinson that
“Iowa was in with the big schools
now and they would receive ﬁrst
consideration."

The situation on the track will
also throw a little light on the at-
tittlde of Iowa’s manager, Last
