Playing football at the White House

by Avrzitii RowusoN

Meet Moose. Moose is actually a deoorated elk head who ‘

doesrit have any eyes—unless a yellow ping pong bail counts—and
whose hairs an cute hangovers. He greets you as you walk into the
white house at 1017 High Sr., better known as the White House
and home to football players Ben Johnson ’10, Chad Christoff '10
John Hereford’lO, Ryan Fletcher’ll and Marc Heronernus '11. ‘

In addiiiort to his livinghuman housemates, Moose is accompa—
nied by other mounted Critters—the living room is a'lodge theme,"
as Christoﬁ'said.This means mat there are birds—especially owlse
deer, elk etc all over the vimlls.

One species you may not ﬁnd in the house regularly are hippies:
perhaps due to the “Hippies use back door”sign on the poreh,which
leads to a sign on the back door that says “Hippies use side door,"—
but they don't have a side door."lt's just a trinket we've collected‘over
the years—we don't enforce it,"Clu-i5toﬁ”said,

This football house could not be complete without a monstrous
television—or two, one ofwhich is held to the oeiling with rope.
And football is always on. Monday night football is always a staple,
and we get up early on Sundays to watch too,” Christolf said.

The house has a very strong community feel. They all play der
fensive positions, which adds to the sense of family in the house.
They have a breakfast nook where they eat together most mornings,
surrounded by a very large alcohol bottle collection that dates back
four' or ﬁve years. While their bottle collection suggests no shortage
of alcoholic beverages, the boys rarely have milk because diey go

through it so quickly y. We have to get creative sometimes with our
meals at the hqouse," Christoir said. “We go through a lot of mac ‘n'
cheese and ramen."

When they arent playing football, the residents spend a con
siderable amount of their time playing bags—a game in which you
toss bean bags through holes in a piece of plywood. The residents of
White House have made their own Bags board, which is painted
appropriately with the school emblemﬁgs to show their school pride.
Bags can now be played at night thanks to their new addition of
outside flood lighting.

Beyond community budding, the men spend time pursuing eie
traeurricuiar activities—including teen literature. Hereford gets his
kicks reading theTwilight books, all ofwhich can be found piled on
his desk looking well rhumbed through. ”I'm sad that the campus
knows about this now,"Heteford said.

“[Heteford] doesrit have anyone to talk to about it,so every now
and then in the weight room, hell bring up some story about Bella,"
Johnson orplained.

There’s also a surprising amount of Harry Potter paraphemalia
in the guys rooms, like Fletcher's Emma Watson poster on his wall,
But ifthey had to choose a house mascot, it wouldn’t be Harry, Bella
or even Moosrit would be Fletcher. “At one point we decided
to go play softball, and [Fletcher] showed up in a clown costume,"
lohnson said.

Forget fantasy heroes and toddermied animals—the ﬁve resi—
dents are the greatest characters orail,

Beer cans line the ﬂoors of 1027 Elm St. and accumulate sit the
bottom of the stairs, The nnme says it allikcvin Cashman '10,
Noah Belong '11. Mike Gallagher '10 and David Monrgomcry'io
are living in a slum—or, rather, the slum,

Mildew in the slioivcrs, food from as hit back as 2005 and use
bestos awaited die gllvs when diey moved in at the beginiung of

, the semester, inheriting the house from the prevrous urotip of cross
country guys “Some stuﬂ you just cant get rid of," Dclong said

An eerie blue light glows from the windows of the Slum, left
over from the underrthCrsea themed party the house threw earlier
in the year. “It hasn't been taken down, and probably never will he,"
Montgomery said.

Franklin—die “Slum Cut"—is the unofﬁcial ﬁfth resident of the
house, and die adoptive parent ofthe human residents of the slum

- “Franklin got us, Delong expl un.ed He was meowing a lot, so we
decided to gfeed him. And then we let him inside," Casliman sriid
However, Animals cant live in the Slum, except for Franklin, De-
long added Franklins house can be found on the front pord1—ltls
a cardboard bor aptly labeled “Franklins House.

Indeed, this is a house where ﬂie accumulation of objects~
whether crit houses or aluminum~is encouraged. “It's really fun
living in a house where you can just staple shit to the walls," said
Montgomery “When you had something cool, you can just put it
on the walla"Cashmr1n added,

This philosophy has evidently been taken to heart—the inills
are ﬁlled vvith pictures, quotes, cross-country medals and pans col~

lected from over the years “Charlie Knuth just left them here last
year," srud Gallagher, who serves as “the Slum Lord”, which means
that it is his duty to tinish oii'all die leftover beers attei parties

The “Furry Room," features the best Wi‘ll decorations of ‘
people's burt marks, since people usually stand on the back of the
couches to dance at partiesln addition to leaving behind their mark,
pirtyegueis risk falling into the “Penalty Bo‘t,"whlch is it closer the
residents have filled with junk and put a couch in front of.

In addition to dancing on couches, the Slum residents have a
tradition ofurinnting olit die windows. “It looks oddly like rain at
night," Claire Flecktnstein '13 said, iecrilhrig her txptncnccs at the
Slum.

The residents themselves, however, wercn't able to share many
stories “We nre. sworn to secrecy, "Casi man said. But they did share
one story of how someone broke their window when they were.
showing people the window to pee out of, but then that person
“chucked all the trophies out onto the lawn." Delong said.

One of dieir favorite traditions of the Slum is the “Minus Two
Book." People get into the book by wronging the slum, like “hav-
ing a hot girlfriend. ,.[l)eing] not really that drunk. . . peeing in Slum
cups...purting ﬁreworks in our toilet," Montgomery said, lenﬁng
through the laundry list ofoffenses.

Despite recording sich offences, the Slum has no rules except
for slum Law which states mat the Slum is nilod by dninlsocracy,
iinish your beers and no apologies. In other wordseslum it, as daey
would say.

Pool your genes at
Swimmer House

av Etna-Eve: Lens

Swimmer House has been making waves on this campus
for longer than any ofthe ciirient swimmers have been splashe
ing in Grinnells Obemiller pool According to the current
residents, Tommy Olson 10, Paul Gag ne 10 and Ian VVarlick
10, szmmers have inhabited the threerbedroom apartment
at 1228 to Main street consecutively for the past 20 years

The residents may have changed, but the decorations tell
the same story. Almost every inch of available wall space [5
decorated with posters and wall hangings accumulated over
the past 20 years, many ofwhich were obtained by lessethane
legal methods.

“A lot of this sturr has been borrowed permanently from
other schools pools," Olson said. “There are a lot of things
that aren't technically supposed to be here.."These unsolicited
souvenirs include banners rrpm the University of Chicago,
University of Nebraska at
Omaha, St. Johns ‘Univer
sity and Carleton, to name
a few.

Street signs from
Grinnell are also on promi-
nent display, but Gagne,
Olson and Warliclt deny
any involvement with pos
sible thefts. “Not to name
any names, but there were some swimmers [lastyear] that re—
ally got into it," Olson said.

Warlick says that they haven't yet had a chance to make
their mark on the house, but already a sign can be found near
the kitchen banning the combination of clam' Juice, tomato
juice and Budweiser

When you drink it, it tastes like somebody ate a bunch of
pizza, then drank a bunch ofBudweiser and then butped into
your face," Olson said. He was unfortunate enough to sample
the concoction after it was left at a party this year.

“There are two rules in the house: ‘Budweiser eon Clama- .
to'is banned from consumption... and ifyou do it standing, do
it in the hushes,"Warlick said.

As the house decor proves, these swimmers are down with
slightly illegal or frowned-upon activitiehincluding those
often discouraged in other groups. “We’re for fornication,
teamecest, swim-cest,"said Warlick. Olson expanded the ope
tions “'We re also up for cross-pollination,” he said.“I have no

problem with strange folks stopping by.

it you do stop by, dont bother to ring the doorbell. We
hear the doorbell and we're like, What the hell' is that?” 01
son said. “The pizza guy rang the doorbell the other day, it
was crazy," Gagne said. Because people notifying residents of
their presence before entrance is weird. or something,

One aspect ofSwimmer House that could actually be con-
sidered slightly weird' is that they dont use the rooms as they
were originally intended. Since the attic was renovated into
what college students might consider a living room, the old
living room has become the third bedroom, and the smallest
room has become the “Rumble Room."

It was supposedly the hookup spot. Things we: a little
crazy up in the attic, so you need a place to do your (hang,
Olson said. The closet like space is outﬁtted with a bed and
a red light, but does not appear to be the most sanitary of
situations

The rest of the plat isnt quite as skelcl‘iyisiwe for n strly
prophylactic on the stairs—but the air of hopeful disarray is
present throughout. on a short Jaunt through the apartment,
VVurlick located shoes he had been lnissiiig~“0h, there are
my hip ﬂopsiLalong with a cable bill that was overdue.

swimmer House is almost reminiscent ofa slightlysehnors
it family home, albeit with one too many ‘boys'imost family
homes do not prominently display Playboy magazines in the
bathroom VVurliclt, Olson and Gngne don’t take credit for the
magazines, though.

"A female resident of the house left all of the Playboys
here, Warlicls said Totally true, Gagne insisted They also
provide Cosmopolitans and The New Yorker for a more vars
ied bathroom experience.

It is clear that everything from the magazines to the col-
lection of refrigerators and microwaves in the attic has been
accumulated over the past two decades. "The beauty of this
house is its ability to embody history and tradition,"Warlick
said.

”We’re also up for (r055—
po/ll'rlaria/l.”
