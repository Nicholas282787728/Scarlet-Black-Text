Q. But what if they cannot
afford to do so?

A. Then they will increase
their income by raising tuition
fees.

What happens next, folks, is
that as the cost of education
goes up, fewer and fewerped
ple can afford to pay all of it,
until the college itself cannot
afford to pay its own prices.
One obvious corrolaryofGrc-
sham’s law is that in a ma
jority of cases, doing The
Right Thing is prohibitively
expensive.

Aside from presenting this
knotty little problem and a
truly delicious picture of the
AAC meeting of the withered
and wise as a sort of three
oldsladiesronrarpurkrbench
event; each witha richer sym~
ptomology of near death than
the next and all grinning like
fiends with Schandenfreude,
Nall didn't deliver much, exw
:ept for a very involved dist
iuisition on secondssemester
registration and preregistras
:ion which will be summed up
it next week‘s 5&8.

Waldo Walker’s speech began
ind ended with a little bor—
rowed thunder from the Truss
:ees. The college MUST de-
crease its budget from 356,
)67,000 to $5,801,000 inl97l‘
Z. The budget priority plan-

ning committee is now holding
and considering departmental
budgets, and will not be heard
from much before March 15.
Most of the rest concerned
the annual problem ofjuggling
admissions and attrition in
order to arrive at the desired
number of students in Septem~
bet. The school hopestobring
its student-faculty ratio up in
the neighborhood ofll.5to one
next semester by bringing the
student body up to 1,250 or so
and decreasing the faculty by
one or two members. They
hope not to repeat the room-
ing debacle of last September,
largely because it is calcular
ted that the unusually low
September-September attri-
tion rate of this last year
(eleven as opposed to an ex-
pected fourteen percent) will
continue through this year.
Any error, then, will be on
the down, not the up side,
since the college feelsitneeds
400 new students next year,
as opposed to the 415 or so
projected last year. One new
factor in thisannual guessing‘
game is the growing cynicism
with which high school studs
ents are beginning to treat the
whole business ofa collegiate
education. Possibly this is
economically caused, as are
so many things now, sinceap-
plications are down every*
where. The unusually high
mid-year attrition rate (seven
percent) is not expected to
continue this summer, as itis
largely attributed to an in*
crease in academic and per
sonal leaves of absence and

increasing participation in
ACM offrcampus programs.
At worst, then, things should
be more or less where they
are now next year. The trus-
tees’ ultimatum cannOt be qur
estioned, although Grinnell is
in a relatively comfortable
financial position. The ques-
tion is, relative to what? The

answer is, pretty bad.

Patricia Leebens has been
selected by Mortarboard to
represent Grinnell in a
contest sponsored by 013*
mour magazine. The maga-
zine asked thirty small
colleges across the country
to select a top female to
represent the school. Pat
is a student adviser in
South Younker and a mem-
ber of the board of dir—
ectors of The Revolving
Door. More details on the
contest will be revealed

 

when they become blown.

(continued from page 5)
had gone unanswered a phone
(211 was placed to the vice-
president for research of the
company in question. Although
he promised to call back with
the desired information, six
weeks passed and there was
still no response.

Other peripheral findings of
the study include: Over half
the Grinnell students surveys
ed think that their room tem* .
peratures are, in general,
satisfactory. 20% said they
were too cold in winter, while
25% indicated they were too
hot.

In an academic year, Grin-
nell students consume4.l tons
of soap and detergent; 1100
pounds of shampoo and rinse;
1100 pounds oftoothpaste; and
730 pounds of deodorant.

Although 8&6 says that use of

Wickershum Asks For Internationalily

(continued from page 5)

proclamation, the flag of the
U.N. should be ﬂown at equal
mast with the American flag.
“Twinning," or the affiliation
of Grinnell with another coir
lege overseas, would help to
create a feeling of interna»
tionality among students here
and abroad. Finally, Grinnell
should indicate its support for
the U.N. by donating .01% of
its total annual income to the
U.N. coffers. This would come
to approximately $600 a year.

Northwestern University is the training ground

The Graduate School at Management at Northwestern pioneered
the concept that Management is a single science . ..

Management is the key to success

Novil’lweslem's Graduate School oi Management has a' new
two-year program for college graduates leading to a

Master's degree.

The curriculum presents the Science of Management in its
general concepts—and—focuses on the theories and techniques
necessary to prepare graduates for management responsibility

Legal abortions
without delay

herbicides on college grounds
has been discontinued, the co-

llege has 15 tons of 2,4-D
derivative in stock, 10 tons of
which was bought last year.
The report says, however, that
"pest control is in compet»
ent hands and that use of pesc
ticides (including herbicides)
appears to be judicious."

The introduction of return
able bettles has produced an
unexpected sideseffect: The
empty bOttles attract insects,
creating a new problem. The
pest control problem is also
intensified by food in student
rooms; the report suggests
"greater frequency of room
cleaning."

Major areas that the report
says should be further explor
ed include:

The phosphates entering Grs
innell water at the treatment
plant.

Possibilities for recycling
waste paper, which accounts
for 27% of all college waste
by weight; also, possibilities
for recycling the 640 pounds
a day of organic waste.

Decreased use of cars for
short trips. LEAP found that
in most cases, it is actually
faster to use a bicycle around
town than to drive and park a
car. It is also cleaner.

One final problem which
LEAP encountered was lack
of student participation. Al-
though it is a continuing pro
gram. many volunteers only
showed up to work once or
twice. The reportstates, “But
the general attitude on campus
was quitepositivesothat stud‘
ent apathy was not antici-
pated."

This portion of the report
concludes that ..itappears
necessary to find a methodlof1
personally reaching students
. . . so that (the) positive
attitude is reinforced. . l But
how this might beaccomplishr
ed is an open question."
