in Second Period.

Milwaukee, Wis. (Special) —— Al—
though outscoring the Marquette
-quintet in the final half, the battling
cagers from Grinnell college could
not overcome a 15 to 9 lead which
the Golden Avalanche scored in the
first half of their game here last
nightand lost, 26 to 22.-

1t was a rough and tumble game
all the way with a total of 29 per-
sonal fouls, two Pioneer men leaving
the game via that route. These
men, Douglas and Humphrey, count-
:ed several of their fouls in endeavor-
ing to stop the scoring of Andrew,
lengthy center, who counted 10
points during the evening. Reed of
'Marquette scored seven points for
second honors with the home team
*While Bobby Delong registered with
seven to lead the Pioneers.

Murray and Delong, midget Grin-
nell forwards worked well together,
scoring the bulk of the points made
by their team. They could not sift
through the Marquette defense for
-short shots with regularity, however.

The Marquette victory evened the
count against the Pioneers for Grin—
nell was victorious in an early sea-
son game at Grinnell, 22 to 15. Coach
Cord Lipe solved the Pioneer defense
this game and nearly doubled the
previous score of the Marquette uutr

tertain occupants of the third floor,

Four, will be a special guest while
Candace Packard and 4 Charles

as being sponsored by the Y. M. C,
A. and ‘1. w. C. A., it is supported
by Lantern, the Student council and
the Council of House Chairmen

Miss Gretchen Steiner, Grinnell
college associate in public relations,
spoke in Cskaloosa Monday on “Be-
yond the Three R’s," and spoke in
Newton Tuesday.

Who is Grinnell's most popular
man? What woman has captured
the most hearts? Next Thursday
these weighty questions will be de-
cided once and for all for the year
of 1930. All those who want to help
inscribe two people's names in the
annals of time to hand down to
posterity as the most popular stu—
dents on the Grinnell campus during
that memorable year when the
fences were erected, the women’s
smoking rule was abolished and
Grinnell won all but one football
game, will vote January 23 or for-
ever hold their peace,

These two people, who will gain
the same distinction that Harris
Cnggeshall and Louise Barton won
in 1923 in the Malteaser contest, will
this year have full-page photographs
in the feature section of the 1931
Cyclone. The winners will-not be
announced until the annual comes
out in May, but it is likely that the
six men and six‘women having the
highest number of points will be
known soon after the close of the
contest.

Pioneers Have First Valley
Game Friday; Play St.
Louis Samrddy.

Grinnell's Pioneer basketball toters
are experiencing little academic work
and a great deal of riding the rails
this Week in getting to distant
courts for cage contests. The
Scarlet and Black proteges of Coach
John Truesdale returned this morn<
ing from Milwaukee, where they toss-
ed‘ the basketball with Marquette
last night, and tomorrow night they
will depart for St. Louis for cage tilts
with Washington university Friday
night and St. Louis university Satur-
day evening.

The Grinnell cage mentor their
eight local basketeers and Trainer
Chad Lemon to the Hilltop game at
Milwaukee last night, and he an-
nounced the first of the week that
probably ten men would make the
trip to St. Louis in addition to Man-
ager Eddie Brawn.

Start Valley Games

Five games are history on the
19294930 Grinnell basketeers card,
but up until now none of the tussles
have had any bearing on the locals'
standing in the Missouri Valley cone
ference cage circle, The affair on
the Washington court in St. Louis
Friday with the Bear ﬁve of Coach
Don White will be the ﬁrst valley
engagement this season for the Grin-
nellians.

Washington is forecasted to repeat
its successful record made last year
this season, and with the terrible
trouncing that it presented to
Creighton, 45 to 33, no one can doubt
but that “Moose" Meyer and his
cohorts have reason to look forward
to another valley cage pennant.

Russian Artist
Plays on Friday

Piatigorsky, Famous ’Cellist,
ls Acclaimed in Europe

and America.

Gregor Piatigorsky, the Russian'

'cellist whose recital will he held at
eight o‘clock Friday evening in Her-
rick chapel, made a brilliant success
of his appearances on the Pacific
coast in December, In Los Angeles
on the evening of December 5, he
played before a capacity audience in
the Philharmonic auditorium. En.
thusiastic reviews by the music
critics attested his success.

“This master 'cellist, Gregor Piati-
gorsky, established a new standard
of vlolincello virtuosity that will cer-
tainly push inspiration is long way
forward in the yet unlived future,"
wrote Carl Bronson in the Les An—
geles “Herald." And Bruno David
Ussher of the “Los Angeles “-Ex
press” wrote. “His technique is a
great wonder and the greater wonr
der is that the message is yet great-
er."

Flatigorsky's west coast concerts
followed his appearance with the
Chicago Symphony orchestra. His
success in Chicagorwas as great as
his later triumph in California.

Ever since he left Russia in 1923,
piatigorslry has been playing before
enthusiastic European audiences. His
home is in Berlin, but he has played
in Holland, France, Poland, and Italy
as well as in Germany. Everywhere
he has been acclaimed as an artist
upholding the highest musical stan-
dards.

Fiatlgorsky is the last, and ac-
cordlng to many critics, the greatest

lane on the concert series

Dean Will Have Wish Fulfilled Tonight;
Lads and Lassies to Eat as One Family

By Arthur l-Iough

Friends and scholars, give ear.
The “Harvard of the West" is to
have the hospitality of the South.
Dinner dates, heretofore almost un-
heard of in Grinnell, will soon be—
come as common as pork in the
“dorm” dining room.

For, lo and behold, that “quad"
idol, Dean Bestty, with the "voice of
the Southland" and the hair of Hol-
lywood, has a plan. Yea, verily, a
plan: and what is even more excit-
ing, a good one.

The plan? Oh, yes! Being from
Tennessee, where hospitality is as
much a by~word as “The Corn Song"
is in Iowa, he has long wanted to
see the lads and lassies of this insti—
tution, taking their vesperian meals.
side by side; like a big family, you
know.

Naturally, it would be well nigh
an impossobility for all of the heavy
eating stronger Sex to march to the
“quad” and eat with the beautiful

young ladies, at one time, nor could
they all come to . the "dorms."
Neighl Neigh: (Insert from Kelly
Stables).

That is where the Dean enters.
His plan, which becomes a
reality this evening, is, that
a few, a mixture as it were, of
freshmen and college men, from each
building, have the honor of dining in
the quadrangle, while a few of the
aspiring “Garbos” and "Crawfords"
from the various cottages go to the
dormitory, in their search for food.
making dinner dates "free gratis,"
and giving the boys who go to the
"quad” a chance to find out what
will be served at the “dorms” on the
morrow.

The beauty of it all is, that this
exchange would not be an annual af—
fair. oh, my 110! It would be done
quite often, in fact here may be the
budding of a new "Grinnell tradi-

Lion.”

 

 

Third Annual
Prudities Are
to Be March 7

Buildings and Cottages Will
Pair to Give Original

Acts in Revue. _
. . J

Will Draw Tonight

Money Prizes Will Be Given Two
as
Best Acts; Journalistic Frat.

Players Sponsor Revue.

Grinnell's third annual Pioneer
Prudities were made certain yester-
day, when at a meeting of the
Dramatic council with a committee
of Sigma Delta Chi, plans were made
for staging the all-college revue, sev-
eral difficulties in the way of pro—
ducing the Prudities were removed,
and the date set for Friday evening,
March 7. The dramauc side of the
production will be under the auspices
of the Grinnell chapter of the Na-
tional Collegiate players, and the
business management under Grin-
nell chapter of Sigma Delta Chi,
journalistic fraternity, which started
the Prudities two years ago.

As in past years, the Prudities will
consist of a series of skits, one—act
plays or comedy revues to be pro-
duced by the buildings and cottages
acting together. The plan is to
have each building draw a cottage
to work with and to have the two,
working together, plan, write and
produce their act. A meeting of the .
house chairmen of the dams and
cottages with a comanittee from Na-
tional Collegiate players and sigma
Delta Chi is being held tonight to
plan for the production and to make
the drawings to pair the buildings
and cottages.

Preview Held

Under a new plan this year, how~ .1
ever, all six acts may or may not _
appear in the ﬁnal production, de-
pending on their merit, for a: week
to ten days before the Prudities, a
pre-view will be held with view to
determining whether all the acts are
Worthwhile and of merit. In Case
all the acts qualify for the final pro~
duction, they will all appear on the
program March 7. otherwise, some
may be cut out. It is thought by
those in charge that this should tend
to create competition among the
buildings and cottages and should
raise the standards of the various
acts.

To the LWO Winning acts will go
prizes of fifty and thirty dollars each.
Who the judge will be has not yet
been determined, but he will doubt»
less be of the same high quality as
