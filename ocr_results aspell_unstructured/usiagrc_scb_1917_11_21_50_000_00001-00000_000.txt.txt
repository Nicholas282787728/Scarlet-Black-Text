Late in the ﬁl'sL quarter the varsity
registered the ﬁrst tally of the game.
The freshmen rcccivcd thc kickoit,

straight line smashes and end ronsa

pass to Augustine lost 15 yards, but
two pla later the big inllback
tossed the ball 20 yards to Raifety on
the tar side or thc last white line, and
kicked the goal after making a nice
punt out to Watt.

An exchange or punts early in the

S ys Professor Brooks
A severe arraignment of the needc
less destruction of priceless works or
art in Bclgium and western France
by German armies was delivered by
Profcssor Alli-ed M. Brooks ot the
University of Indiana in his lecture
on “Ruined Gothic Churches" at Her»
rick chapel last Saturday cvening.
Professor Brooks dcclared that the
destruction of cathedrals and other
wonderful pieces of art was not only,
the loss oi Belgium and France, but
the loss of the whole world as well.
The German nation could only, he
asserted, be considered or entirely
mad to permit such acts oi vandal-
ism, the eilect of which will be thin-
rious to Germany [or many years.
The lecture was illustrated with
pictures or cathedrals, showing them
as they were bciore the war and also
as they are now alter the Germans
have damaged them.

MT, VERNON. Nov 20. Cornell is

worked thru a stiff schedulc, which
terminated in a hard battle with Coc
last Saturday, “Sllerm” is getting his

important panic at the year.

Slub Hartwell, captain and quarter
back, is out of the game with a bro-

Grnmcll. However, thc purple team
is planning to light to the last whis-

EXPEGT FIERBE BATTLE
WITH PUBPLE‘SATURDAY

Grinncll will play Cornell next Sat-
urday at Mount Vernon. To zt Gl'ln—
nell football fan that means much. It
means the ﬁcrce battle which is sure
to result when these two teams meet;
it means the last game lor nine men
whose playing has placed the scarlet
and black high in gridiron circles for
the past three years.

That the gamc will be hard fought
is a certainty. Gl'irlllcll’s chanccs arc
much cnhnnccd by the fact that Cue
detected Cornell last Saturday by a
the score and Grinrreli cleaned on Coe
earlier in the season by a 48430th
margin, However, comparative scores
will mean little in this game. Cor-
nell always gives Grinncll a battle
royal, and altho she may hc without
the services oi some of her stars,
altho she had a hard game last Sat~
urday while Grinncll has the beneﬁt
of a two weeks rest, the game next
Satnt~day.rvill be no exception to the
usual Coi'llellsGl'iuucll scrap.

Lnsl. Game for Nine

The majol'ity of the team which
will face Cornell will be playing their
last football game for Gl'innell. The
men have expressed a determination
to “do their durndcst” in their last
game, As one of Them expressed it,
“It. will he the last gztrue for nine or
us, and we're sure going in it to give
everything that's in us."

The team is in good condition for
the ﬁnal game. The skirmish with

remorse-l.

continence.»

 

,thc freshmen last night served to put

the Varsity on edge fur a battle royal.
