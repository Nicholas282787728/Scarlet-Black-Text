beginning his musical studies at the
e of seven, ltlr, Levitski early laid
e foundation for an extraordinary
sical career. His first appearances

ere he made his debut at Berlin in
14. After making an extensive tour
Austria Hungary and Norway, he
one to the United States and made
s debut in Aeolian Hall, New York
ty, in 1916, Since then he has made
tensive tours not only in America
t also in Australia. and New Zeae

Plays thli Symphonies
During the season 19244-5 Mr. Le-
ski made sixtyrfive appearances in
w York City, seventeen in Chicago.
1119611 in' Sydney, Australia, ten in
elbourne, Australia, and nineteen
'th the New York symphony Orches-
a as well as at least four appearanc—
with every other major symphony
chestra in America. In the season
st begun he will make his first tour

the orient, and his ninth tour of
erica from coast to coast.

Glenn Dillard Gunll, writing in a
ted Chicago paper, refers to Levit-
i as “a great master" whose playing
hihits such “delightful variant on
assic form" that he combines the
-mcnts of immortal music with a
rrect interpretation of modern mus-

“He fully deserves the tributes of
-eathless silence and tumultuous ap-
ause which his listeners accord
to."
coordinates Well

Most critics agree that it is in the
on and Beethoven divisions of his
ogram that Levitski is at his best.
ith these artists his uneriing in-
inct for music and his coordination
movement seems to be at the high-
.t point. It is chiefly because of his
terprctation of these masters that
« has been proclaimed as “one of the
w who can make the piano Sing.”
Mr. Levitski's appearance in Grin-
ll is hot his first visit to low, for
. was well received in Des Moines in
cent months. A Des Moines Regise
r critic has described his playing as
ike a crystal through which flow a
ndred tints and shadings."

Even in far away Cuba, Levitski’s
ncerts have been heard with much
thnslesni. One of the reviewers for
leading Cuban paper speaks of him

"a. veritable virtuoso of the key-
hard. His tone is pure, brilliant, mel—
.w, exquisite and caressing!

Prep Squad Has
Star Hoopsters

Daily Scrimmages “ 1th Varsity Show
Frvsll Hine Basket: Eye.

Basketball stock in Grinnell will
receivequite a boost next year when
the present freshman squad becom‘es
eligible for varsity competition. The
preps have one of the most promising
outfits of recent years. Starting out
the season with about thirty candi—
dates, a fast and smooth working
quintet has been developed which
easily captured the inter—class tonl'ne
anient by completely outplaying their
their opponents. Since the opening
of the Valley schedule the freshmen
have been used with great effect
against the varsity. Their fast run»
ning attach, clever floor work and
close guarding have made them a
dangerous team.

Captain “Red" Fail, Des lIoines,
is a guard with much expe ence, He
participated for four years in the
high school league in the Capitol Cit
and came to Grinnell with a good
rccord. He follows the ball closely
and knows the zone system of guard-
ing.

Hai is Coggeshall, also ll'om Des
Moines, is Fall's mate at guard. "cog—
gy" played at Roosevent High before
enter-lug Grinnell. He is the fastest
man on the squad and shows plenty of
class. Good floor work and a steady
eye mark him as a promising basket-
ball man.

Jack cannaway, Grinnell, has shown
up well at guard. He is a fighter
and a hard little man to get the ball
away from. He passes nicely, and
with a little more size will beavalu-
ab‘le man next year.

Charles Schroer, Sioux City, has
performed well at center. He is a
rangy lad and puts up a good floor
game. His basket eye is rapidly im—
proving and by next winter he should
bid well for a varsity berth.

George McCully, Jefferson, can play
at center or forward positions and has
been seen at both, His floorwork and
hasketshootiugability have made him
a reliable scorer for the freshmen.
_Rtlssel,l Gray, Storm Lake, playing
at forward, is the big offensive star
of the prep squad. He possesses a
keen eye for the hoop and is a sure
shot on the court. He is hard to
guard, and works well with his team-
mates. He was the outstanding star
of the class games and his playing
has marked him as varsity material
for next year.

Don Duke, Washington, is playing a
fast game at forward. He is a good
floor man and is developing into a
valuable forward.

Cliff Ingram, Moline, 111., has shown
up well at forward and is developing
a sure eye for the basket. He works
well with the team and with a little
more experience should show up well
next year.

quite distasteful. Either the lord or

she marry the country genltman when
the other suitors meet an untimely
death.

Miss Wave Richards, who previously
star d as Piel'rettc in "The Mournv
ers’ will take the role of Miss Allan-
by. She plays the part on short lio-
tice because of the ineligibility or one
of the players, and Mr. Angus feels

that it is complimentary to her ability

as an actress that she has been Chos—

“Callllugcs” Allol'tls Contrast

A distinct contrast is afforded in the
production of “Chhbflges,” a play of
modern life which deals with the
trials aild tribulations of a newly rich
family which aspires to social fame.
In this story there is much human in—
terest motive evident in the attempt
to achieve social position by way of
the almighty dollar.

Theodore Pellel'son ,whc has ap-
peared in Grinuell di-aniatics before,
takes the leading part as Gus Gross
nreir, and the other members of the
cast are diary Matlack, Mrs. Gross-
iueir; Joseph McKee, Jenks,a report»

gist; Marjorie Williams, Tildy, the
daughter.

Grillllell Alumnus ill ’90 Will Give Ilib‘
Interpretation ol‘ Lincolirs

"The German Vote and Lincoln" is‘

the subject of the lecture to be given
by Prof. F, I. Hcl'riott, of Drake unl-
vcrsity, at long chapel Friday ll‘AOl‘nv
ing at 9:40, as the fourth number of
the college lecture course.

Professor Hel‘riott has made exten-
sive studies of the part the Germans
in our country took in the proceedings
which led to Lincoln's first nominee
tied and election. This is a conipal
Lively recent field of political re-
search, and scholars say that Profes-
sor Herrlott probably knows more
about this particular phase of Lin-
coln's me than any other luau iu the
United states.

will Discuss 'I‘u'o Factors

The general objective of the ad-
dress is to explain anoln’s elevation
at Chicago in 1360. Frolessor Her-
riott will deal with the two neglected
factors which ill his judgment chief-
ly account for Lincoln's nomination
contrary to public expectation and to
the astonishment of most persons not
familiar with the basic currents that
actually determined the result.

This long chapel service tails very
appropriately on Lincoln's birthday.
Ill bringing a Grinnell audience this
newly discovered material on Lin-
coln's political life, Professor He 7
riott will present conclusions which
he may later publish.

Professor Herl’iott ls {l
alumnus of the class of '90, and he
has sent three children to Grillllell
college. Maxwell Herriott, '20, is
well known as a Rhodes scholar and
member of Phi Beta Kappa. He is
now practicing law at Madison, Wis

TRACKSTERS WILL
COMPETE AT AMES

to T lgula)’ Indoor Mcct,

The Pioneer track team will he rep—
resented by fifteen men at the annual
Amos-Drake-Gl‘lnnell triangular in-
door meet at Ames next Saturday. It
is expected that the wearers of the
Maltese cross will be entered in Drac-
tiCally every event with the possible
exception of the pole vault and the
longer races.

Little done is obtainable on the re
spective strength of the three schools.
as each has track stars out for bas-
ketbdll who will not compete during
the indoor season. Grinnell should
be certain to score” points in the
weight events with Rjnefort and
Meeter doing well in practice, but
Ames can always be collated on for
high class weight men, capable
scoring.

Captain Scbarnweber may score in
the shorter'rftces, if he can get in con-
tlition in tithe, but in most of the oth-
er events the Pioneers will be repre.
sented by inexperienced men. The
loss of Taylor, Star hurdler who has
been the mainstay of the Pioneer track
teams for the litst three years, will

he keenly felt, and Coach ”Doc” Huffy

has been having difficulty in finding
hurdlers to fill the gap.

The list of track men who will
make the trip will not be chosen until
later in the week.

Women and freshmen will be kept
out of the Ohio State U, cheering sec-

tion.

Elliot hit the hoop consistently from
any and all angles from the start of
the game, annexing ten field goals in
all, the majority of them in the first
half. The Pioneers missed many set—
ups, and only succeeded in making
two baskets in each period, Peterson
garnered two the first half, and Mark
