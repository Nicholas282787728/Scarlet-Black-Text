it will be depends largely, in each

what he finds here. Those of us who
are old, and who are her-e to welcome
those of you who are new, once came

Yearling Gridders to
Hear Call Very Soon

The date for the first freshman
football practice has not been set but
it is expected that coach Lester Duke.
will issne the call the last of this
week or the first of next.

The strength of tho yearling grid-
ders is never known iiutil later in the
season but some good material is in
the ranks of the class of 1929 and will
greet the coach as soon as the call
is given.

The freshmen mentor this year will
be Lester Duke, '25, tackle on the
Griiiuell team last year. He was un-
anamously chosen by the Missouri
Valley coaches for a berth on the
mythical all—Valley team. He was a
member of the varsity basketball
squad two years ago and has been on
the track squad for three years,
where he showed up well as a halt
iniler and iavelin thrower.
