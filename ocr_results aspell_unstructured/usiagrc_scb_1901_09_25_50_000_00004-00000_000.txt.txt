FOOTBALL PROSPECTS,

Much Rivalry for Places on the Team,

Prospects tor the lowa College
team [or igoi are good. With a
much lighter schedule than last
year to play and over half of last
yeai’s team out for practice it
looks as if we could hope tor a
reasonable number of victories.
Willi the new men that are com-
iiig in, the team will be slightly
heavier than last year. A goodly
number of candidates are out and
competition for places on the team
is sharp. Especially in the line
most of the positions are not def-
initely settled. Baggs \vlll prob
ably matte guaid while Collins,
Lewis. Lister and Smith are all
possible candidates for this posir
tiori. At tacitle McKeag and Van
Dike are the most probable men
but the positions are by no means
cinclled. Dunn will have little
competition at center but the ends
are very much undecided. Don
Evans will play one while Marsh,
Moore, Chase and wiliet may any
of them make the 'varsity this
year. The players are being tried
at various positions and the com-
position of the 'Varsity line will
be in doubt until after the Drake
grime, Oct. 5.

Back of the line there is not. so
much rivalry. Fisk, in his old po»
sition at quarter will play his usual
good game, Weilter and Evan
Evans are practically sate as
halves. with Lyman as full-back.

Practice is now beginning to be
sharp and the team is getting into
shape to defend the Scarlet and
Black with honor. Jack is watclr
in'g the condition ot the men and
that means that they will play
through their games and will be
in the best possible physical con.
dition.

Next Saturday we play an ex-
hibition game with Ames at Mare

shalltown. The game there is to
be one of the features of the Mar—
shalltown carnival which is in
progress now. On the Friday tnl.
lowing comes the electric light exV
liibition game with Drake and the
season ivill then be fully open,

r2o.YARD HANDICAP.

At Ward Field Oct. 5

The handicap [20 yards will be
held one week from next Satur-
day, at Ward Field. A large
number of men have eitleietl {or
this event and it now promises to
be interesting, The limit of the
handicap is to yards. Jack Wat.
son will be ihc handicappcr and
starter, while Capt. Lyman ivill be
referee.

It has been the custom of the
Giiniiell track team to have a
“fall handicap meet" for the main
purpose or trying out new men,
Last year such a meet was planned
but on account ot rain and post-
ponement, there was only the 100
yards contest. This year no meet
is planned, but there is to be a no
yard handicap race.

The reason a fall meet cannot
be held is because of the fact that
the trainer cannot see to the track
men and tootball squad at the
same time. It is more important
that we should have a wellrcon-
ditioned football team, than to
have a good (all meet. If we had
an intercollegiate meet this fall it
would be far different. Jack must
be left where he can do the most
good in our intercollegiate athlet-
ic relations.

It ivill not hurt (my man to train
for the sprints. It will do anyone
good, whatcvcr his event may be.
All who are interested in track

work should hand their names to
the captain tor Jack to consider
in the handicapping. A tull list
of the entries will be printed next
week.
