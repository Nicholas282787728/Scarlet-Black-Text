Whether or not the war conditions
of next year will put an end to root-
ball in the state of Iowa, no one can
say, but Grinncll is optimistic enough
to believe that it Will not. At present
the authorities are arranging the
schedules as has been done in all pre-
vious years.

It is not likely that the loss of a few
men will prevent the schedule from
belng played any more than usual,
but no statement could be obtained to
this effect.

A new feature has been added to the
schedule which is an innovation tor
Gl-lnnoll, On November 10 the Fresh-
man team has a game scheduled with;
shattuck illlltaly School. This school
has the reputation or always having a
very strong l‘ootball team and should
give the ye hugs of next year ii good
battle. It not expected that the
war condition will have any matcrial
cllect on next years freshman class,
even should it cut in on the other
three classos. There are still three
opcli dal on the varsity slate, but
these, it is expected, will be ﬁlled up
in the next three weeks. Des 1 oines

DEMAND INDREASES
FDR FARM IABDRERS

College Bureau Receives Many Re-
quests From All Sections of the
United slnt8570llly Six
Students Apply for
Positions.

With a rapidly increasing demand ‘

for farm laborers from all sections of
the United States and only six student
applications for positions, the College
Bureau of Labor has been unable to
ingot the demands which have come to
it through the state Bureau at Allies,
according to a statement made last
night by Prof. Canard, chairman at
the committee.

A coucst from on agricultural cou-
earn in Mason City yesterday asking
for ﬁfteen laborers has not yet been
tv of stu-
dcuts who are seeking war. on im

It is thought, however. that a large
number arc making their own or-
i-augcmenis to spend tho Slimmer
months ill agricultural pursuits, and
for that reason have not made ap-
plication tn the College Eurccu. An
urgent demand from Wyoming for tcn
laborch was recently received, but
owing to the high cost or transporta-
tion and cxccssiv—cly low wogcs, it was
not thought atlv.ablc to recommend
these positions to students. Similar
demands from other sections of the
counti have also bccn i-ecectcd, for-
materially the some reasons.

A letter has born sent to the Na-
tional Council of Defense at Wash-
illgtoll, asking lor ' tructions rela-
tive to the dispos on of gindoatc

IOWA CONFERENCE MEE

T

.SQUIBS

 

Johnson of Des Moines certainly put
his foot down often and law apart in
the half mile run. He was in a mighty
hurry to reach the ﬁnish and did it in
2:01:1.

Daft has a record of 9:55 in the
two niilc grind and his defeat at the
slower [igloo yesterday may have bcen
due to his entrance into the half mile.

oiic of the Grinch men who
worked as hard as aliyouc, but who
didn't make on appearance on the
track, was "hob" Aldcu, the ofﬁcial
”rubber.” He was on deck at all
times to rub out score and tircd iiius-
cles, and certainly deserves credit for-
the work he has done with the entire
squad this season

With the cxccption or the relays, fill
the events were run on on schedule
time. The delay in the relays is ac-
counted for by the fact that some
membcrs of the Coo team were ln-ond
jumping at thc timc,_and the event
was postponed until tlic jump was
ﬁnished.

Collins of Coo started out the cum--
tcr at an awful pace, but couldn’t keep
it up, and Burden passed him likc n

Sallie excitement was occasioned
late in the afternoon when the "fly
cops," who have their quarters under
the grand stand, started a ﬁre ill the
stove, and the smokc came pouring
out of the chilnncy zlt the rear of the
stand.

Borden or Grinncll and Massey of
Goo had some interesting bouts during
the afternoon. Bordon wus victorious
iii the quarter milc. Then hlnsscy won
out ln the last lap of the long relay
when he was given a good lead over
the Grillllell man, although he beat
Harden lo the tape only by inches, Ill
the . art rclcy, Bardcll had a short
start over his rival, which Massey
soon evened, bllt Dal-den 1'an away
from his mall in the last 75 yo and
gave Hoyt the baton with a clear ﬁeld
before him.

Osgood was thcrc with balls on as
the onnounccr. He was prompt iii
giving the results of each ram, and
kept tllc crowd posted on the ﬁeld
events as they progressed.

'I'hc ﬂag which waved from the im-
provised [lug pole in front or the
stand was a mighty wolconic sight to

 

whirlwind at the north turn.

 

ovoryonc present.

DArrow ran it beautiful race in the

short relay. Receiving the baton in
last place, he pa- ed his two rivals ill
the ﬁrst ﬁfty yards, and then kept on
going until llC gave Burden it safe lead
over his man.

Grinnciliclls can ncl-cr forget the
grin that spread itself over "Chuck"
Hoyt's face as he linisllcd the low
hurdlcs ahead of Massey oi Cue, and
a sccolid faster than the state record
time.

A sprinkle of rain near the cud ol'
thc moot slartcd an exodus of the
crowd from the grand stand, bllt the
shouted warning from “Ossy” to "wait
for tho half mile rclal',” halted thc
proc Oil, And no one regretted that
he stayed!

Simpson brought a team of four men
and each counted iii some event.
Diluagan and Daft allowed Ilrctiy team
work in the two lnilc, bill the ﬁnal
sprrilit ol‘ Otis was too good for them.

IInrris ol.‘ Coc afforded some :tmusc-
lilcut ill thc pole vault, when with the
bar at the 1:5 mark he lricd to shin
up the pole and drop Ovel‘. Hc ncorly
got :lll'ny with it at that.

Coe Is Second.

Following'trne to preliminary dope,
Coe and Cornell were the two schools
to offer the scarlet athletes the great-
est compctltiou. Coe ﬁnally placed
second with 39 1-o points. and Cornell
was not far behind wrth 33 1-2. Simp-
son captured ﬁrsts in the mile and in
the pole vault with enough other
places to land thenl fourth with 11 1-2
points. Highland Park made 9 1-2
points, Parsons G 1-2, and Des
lloincs 5.

The weather was almost all that
could be dcstrel‘l, and although it was
cloudy part of the afternoon, and rain
threatcncd near the end, this had little
ell'ect on the meet. The crowd was
largely a local one. and numbered
over a thousand.

The day opened auspiciously for
Gl'inuell, when Hoyt, harden and
Fleming captured the ﬁrst three places-
in the 100, forcing hiasscy of Coc into
l'olu-tb. The time was 10 flat. A scar-
lct trio repeated this same stunt in the
:20 yard dash, when Hoyt, Darrow and
Fleming copped tho 220,- ith the time
of 21 4-5 Gena of Highland Park
was the man to get fourth place this
time.

Mile I5 Spectacular.
Thc m_llc run ended with a spectacu-

'lAi~ neck and neck race between Daft

of Simpson and Paul )IacGrcgor of
Gilllncll, the former barely winning.
Tllo high hurdles wont to Massey of
000 ill 16 . llelldricksou of siillp-
son won ccond, but w - disqualiﬁcd

with Coc's dark skinned arhlctc, Cnl~
lins, leading up to tile last 100 yards,
when he was passed by Borden, then
by Zelglcr of Pal-sons, Boyldn of Col--
licll and Llldck g of Cornell. Barden
,fluishcd ﬁrst in 51 I , equalling the
conference record time madc by Bailey
or Doe, and lending his nearest coul-
pctitor by 7 yards.

Half Nile Record Goes.

Des Moincs made but ﬁve points in
tile meet, but they won {mile ill so
doing, as Johnson bl-okc the confer-
ence record in tlic half-tulle run, and
camc lll ahead of Pcclr.of Cornell, and
Sprinkle and .l. Ii. MacGl-egol' of the
local collcge.

’l'lic half mile relay wos easily won
by Gi-innell, cacll man of the scarlet
quartet gaining ml his rivals. Hoyt.
who ran the last lap, had a low . or s
sldlt over “1550} of Con. which he i -
creased to foul cell at the tape. The
(him made was 1:35 3 '. just 1-5 5007
and slower than the record lime pie-
l'iollsly mode by Gl-illucll,
