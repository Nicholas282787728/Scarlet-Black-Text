The First Paper

by Jim Alt

I honestly do not understand. I
write nearly twenty papers 3 year,
yet the first one of any given year
is always like the first one ever

It is even worse thanwritingacolr
uinn, A paper has to make sense
I had hoped that this year’s lirst
paper would be something light,
maybe some ZOOrlevel poli sci b s.
But no, I had to get stuck with a
AOOrlevel economicssenior seminar
paper, due the next lime class met.
Now, I do not dislike economics;
indeed, it is one or my majors, But
the fact that prolessionzlleconomists

can It the “dismal science” must
prove something. I shall not d

cuss what undergrad mayors call it,

So Iwas assigned to read this pile
of journal articles and was told to
make some sense out of them, I
do not know about other disciplines,
but in economics the top dogs not
only try to dazzle one another in
the journals; they also take subtle
but direct personal shots at each
other,

Thus in a single article, on separ
rate levels, the author is laying
out a complicated theory and simulr
taneously calling his proiessionai
rivals stupid andbigoled. Readsome
Samuelson and you will understand,
It is great iun.

Anyhow, it seemed like a good idea
to get the articles and read them
until I understood them, I read the
six articles five times apiece. This
resulted in my becoming live times
as confused as if I had read them
once.

ln economics this means that you
are making progress it you think
you understand a piece of economic
theory, it is a sale bet that you do
noL in other words, 1 was ready
to start writing.

Well, almost ready It was still
three days belore the class met,
and I have a moral hangup about
writing papers early. l have this
nightmare that someday I will finish
a paper two days early, and that the
world would be blown up before I
turned it in. Wasted effort grates
cruelly on an economist’s sensibil-
ities.

So I located a convenient two-day
party. This party not only rescued
me from my nightmare, but also leit
me in terrific shape to start the
paper. 1 write my best papers when
I feel the worst. That way I am not
tempted to carouse any more,

Eventually I dragged myseli to the
coffee house, where the lights are
dim enough to ease the pain and
the chairs are hard enough to keep

me awake I felt so bad that I
actually wanted we write the paper,
probably as a perverse iorin oi
penance.

The actual method I follow inwrit-
ing papers is a little unorthodox,
I do not use outlines or consciously
think about the paper before I start
writing, I rely on my subconscious
to have sorted and organized the ma-
terial belore lstart Then I go into
a trance [mm which I awaken five
to twenty pages later.
madness overcame me. Iwhipped
oil six pages in three hours, al-
though I remember nothing of those
three hours. I do remember be
coming aware that the paper was
done and that I could go get sick
now, All that remained was revi»
sion and typing.

Except that when I went back to
start revising, it became clear that
I did not understand what I hadwrlte
ten, Unlike journal articles, this
is not a sign at a good paper. In
iact, it is a sign oi an “r" paper.
Those are hard to justify in a
senior seminar.

So I was forced to fall back on
my personal revision method, which
involves liberal use of scissors and
scotch tape. I cut the paragraphs
apart and rearrange them until they
make sense; if that fails, I move
down to individual sentences. When
I start cutting apart words,it is time
to get an extension.

This time I lucked out. After re-
arranging just three paragraphs, I
decided the paper was acceptable
Besides, I had already out two fin-
gers and was out of tape, Thepaper
was ready to be typed.

I will not dwell on the typing of the
paper. I admit that five hours for
six pages might be thought a little
slow. My only deiense is thatl
found another party before Ihegan
typing.

Finally the paper was done, , come
plete with a nonsense title, ;"a study
in Academic Obstinacy”; Iwas a
little unhappy with Samuelson. For
rest and recreation I decided to
stroll across campus and check my
mailbox.

It was a beautiful day, with birds
singing and people iolling on central
campus, My paper was finished, due
in class the next day, and I could
unwind. And then, lurking in my
mailbox, was the notice:

"Senior Seminar in Economics will
not meet tomorrow."

And the sky clouded over, and the
rain began to lall.

SUKKAH

You are looking at a Sukkah which

is built on SUKKOT, the Jewish
lestival oi booths or tabernacles,
marking the autumn harvest oi
grains and iruits at the end oi
the year and commemorating the
SUKKOT in which the Israelites
dwelt in the wilderness alter their
exodus irom Egypt. This Sukkah
was constructed on central campus
last Saturday alternoon by a group
oi Grinnell Jewish students, ceIEr

by Gregg Daffner

The standard oi value (by which
one judges good or evil) oi the
Objectivist ethics is man's life--
“that which is required for man’s
survival qua mail " This means the
“terms, methods, conditions, and
goals required for the survival of a
rational being through the whole or
his lifespanrdn :ill thoseaspects
of existence which are open to his
choice'K It does not mean momen-
tary or more physical survival,
nor what is expressed as “sur-
vival at any price”. -

Reason is man’s basic means of
survival and therefore that which
is proper to the ‘life at a rational
being is good, that which hinders
or destroys it is evil, Further»
everything man needs must be dis-
covered by his own eiiectnthere-
tore the two essentials of the
method of survival proper to man

the difference between ”standard”

be applied to each man, The job or
applying this principle to the con-

and the life he must live is his

The purpose of a rational man‘s
life, the central value determining
the heirarchy of his other values
is productive work. Its source»-
reason; its consequence--pride
The virtue of Rationality means rec
cognizing and accepting that one's
only source oi knowledge, )udge oi
values, and guide to action is—-
reason. It is the total commitment
to a state of complete conscious
awareness, of a full mental focus in
all issues and choices in all oione's
waking hours and thus the convic-
tion that all ofone's values, goals,
desires, and actions must be derived
from and validated by as precise a
process at logical thought as one’s
iullest ability permits.

It means the acceptance ol the re~
sponsibility oi making one's own
judgements and living by the work

any value or consideration above
one's own perception of reality--
whch is the virtue of Independence,

(Integrity), never taking reality in

lettuce Quandary; Walters Sparks D.C. Group

by Steve Nunn
sin nine-nun mum

(Washington, Di: ) -Some people
seem to be boycotting lettuce as an
act of faith, without knowing much
about the situation at 31]. Others are
ignoring or opposing the boycott, on
the theory thatif the 1972 Democratic
national convention was for it, then
they must be against it. But neither
side seems to know mllch about it,
and much media reporting has been
sketchy and contradictory.

The lettuce boycott started almost
immediately alter the grape boycott

among them about 15% oi the work—

The remaining 15% apparently are
still unorganized.

To this point, the UFW, the growers

be in agreement (the national headr
quarters at the Teamsters here rer
fused to comment).

The central area of disagreement
seems to be the present position

happening here is the development

Greenhouse also has a hunt olpre.

Greenhouse carries it off.

Though Greenhouse is the front

he plays ﬂute and writes some of
the groups best numbers

He has a long solo piece that imi~

The virtue of Pride is the recog

make his life worth sustaining--
that as man is a being oi selivniade

The Iundamental socialprinciple oi
the Obyectivist ethics is “that just
as liie is an end in itsell, so every
living being is an end in himself,
not the means to the ends or the
welfare or others ~and, theieiore,
that man must live lor his own sake,
neither sacriiicing himseli to others
nor sacriiicing others to himself."
This means that man’s highest moral
purpose is the achievement oi his
own happiness,

Happiness is a state of conscious-
ness which is a consequence oi the
achievement of one’s values Where
a man values productive work, his
happiness is the measure at his
success in the service of his life.
But when a man Values destruction

pursuit oi happiness are twonspects
