College administrators are currently Corr
sideiing making major changes to Grinncu‘s
drug policy after SGA President Chris Hall
’07 recently made the issue one of his top prir
orities. Based on the student initiative Hall
sponsored, which passed with nearly 74 per—
cent of the vote in March, the
new drug policy would be simie
lar to the college's current alco-
hol policy

“Personally, I’ve been wants
ing to tweak the college’s drug
policy for a couple years," said
Hall, who had a runtin with the law his first
year. “Given the opportunity now within SGK,
l drafted the initiative and started discussing
it more seriously with stove Briseoe and Tom
crady."

As ofyct, nothing has been approved. Brit

tioiiul reform, completing one last election and
contemplating the chadenges ahead. After a
year of both controversy and accomplishment,
members of SGA are positive about the work
that has been done and conﬁdent that this
progress can continue in the future.

“Everything that SGA is supposed to do
has been done well," said SGA Treasurer Brad
Bishop '08. “There has been no weak point in
Cabinet this year.”

After a renewed focus on implementation

President Chris Hall ’07 ' ed the creation of
the Student Initiative (STIFund) as a

for students to get involved," said Hall. “The
STIFund adds interest and credibility to the
whole process." '

Hall proposed the STIFund in his state of

Students plan pajama protest of JRC’s closing time

Administration claims complicated logistics while students try to make-the campus center a 24 hr building

Bv JEFF RADERSTRONG

On this upcoming Tuesday night, security guards making
the ﬁnal sweep of the JRC will encounter a group or students
in their Pjs. When security asks them to leave, they will refuse.
These security guards will have stumbled across the Pajama
Party Protest.

An ad-hoc student committee made up of SGA members
and students at-large organized the Pajama Party Protest (PPP)
to protest the JRC not being open 24 hours a day. Today, the
committee members sent a joint memo to Tom Crady. Vice-
President of Student Services, alerting him to the protest cc,
cutting Tuesday, May 8. Participants in the PPP will gather latc
Tuesdayin theme and spend the night sleeping, stiidying,and
hanging out.This protest comes at the end ofthe ﬁrst year the
jRC has been open which protest planners believe could have
been used more extensively by students.

“We want to work towards the future of the building,” said
Jan Koszewski '08,VicetPresidcnt of Student Affairs-elect and
a member ofthe protest planning committee.

The PPI’ is the ﬁnal event in a long discussion with the
administration, and it 'was originally scheduled for two weeks
ago, but pushed to next week upon the discovery of the body of

Paul ShumanrMoore '09, “It seems like this has been an ongOr
ing conversation," said Koszewki. "People have gotten fed up
with promises of this Will happen later."

According to Michael Sims, Senior Associate Dean for
Student Life, the administration is concei tied with the logistics
of keeping the JRC opcn 24 hours. continuous access would
eieate difficulties for cleaning as well as increase security liabili-
ties. Btit as students iead in an all campus e:inail on Wednesday
May 3 sent by suns, the JRC will now be open until 2 a.m.

This email also mentioned that there are plans to extend
the JRC’s hours until 4 am. in the fall. Sims said that this is
as late as they can keep it open, due to cleaning concerns. "I'd
like to leave that window so that they [the custodians] can feel
comfortable," he said.

Sims also believes that this eventual two and a half hour
window (as the JRC reopens at 6:30 am.) is acceptable. "How
many people are really going to be up during that time?" he
said.

Some students think there are quite a few. “I would use
any building on campus if it were open 24 hours," said Vince
Mertcs,'08.

In addition to logistical problems, administrators are cone

cerned that 24eltonr access would provide a bad example to the
students. “We were not looking to have the building open 24
hrs hefause [of the concern] oflack ofslcep for students,”$iins
said. “We [would] mirror for them things that are unhealthy
This is an institution ofhighet leaining.”

But Koszcwki said this is not ajustiﬁcd response to the de
mand for 24-hour access. “You have Noyce sitting tight .icross
the way with 24 hour access to anyone,"he said.

Sims responds to thesccriticisms by arguing that the JRC
is a much more complicated building than Noyce and is much
harder to keep continuously open, Said Sims,”We have a whole
lot of other activities that go on in the building," such as the
Marketplace and the Grille, as well as all the administrative
and student offices.

Some feel that 24shour access to the JRC goes beyond the
issues of accessible study spaces and resonrccs.“1t's the prin»
eiple of the matter," said Julie Edwards ’07,sStudcnt Services
Coordinator. “It's a student center; we need a place where peo
ple can be."

Edwards thinks that the PPP reﬂects this idea among the
students. “The PPP has become something different than a
protest,"she said. “[It's] a unity event."
