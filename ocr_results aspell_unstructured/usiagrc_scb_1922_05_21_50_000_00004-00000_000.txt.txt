In Part of “Peg.”

“Peg 0' Mil-lean," a. clever Irish

lently presented by Chresto-Ellis so-

cieties in the Colonial Theater Satur»l

The plot of "res 0' My Heart" deals
with a vivacious Irish lassie who goes
to live with aristocratic relatives in
England. Sho meets with a cold ro-
ception at the hands of her aunt, Mrs.
Chichester, and her cousins, Ethel
snd Alarlc, who only_ consent to under~
take her education to the ways oi the
aristocracyrhecause ot a ﬁnancial in-
ducelnent. Peg rebels in her forcible
lrish way at the treatment which she
receives, but while at the Chichester's
she tails in love with a rich young
Englishman, Jerry This mm the
background for a number or interest—
ing situations which never failed to
hold the interest and to amuse the
audience throughout the play.

Without douht first honors go to
Miss Frances Busby, to whose bril-
liant acting a great part of the sues
cess oi the play is due. The produc—
tion was essentially a leading lady's
play and all oi the action was centers
ed on peg, the young lrish girl in
whose part Mis Bushy was cast. As‘
the little, saucy lrish girl, iuil oi inn
and wit yet possesing common sense
and a high moral character, filled with

angry and quick tempered, the next
forgiving and loving, Miss Busby in—
terpreted this part in an exceptionally
pleasing way. She was clearly at
case on the stage and was master 0!
all oi her scenes. Her lines, unusu-'
ally full 0! quick irish wit, were exe-
cuted excellently Not a line was
slighted, not a situation lost. She
got everything out or her part because
she possessed that quality which iew
amateur actors have; she had “punch"
in her acting. Miss Busby may well
be proud or her acting in this play
because it was by it that she won tor
herseli an enviable reputation as an
actress in college dramatic circles
and endeared herself to all the play
lovers oi the community. '
Second honrs go to Haldane
Crooks who played the part oi
Alaric, a typical young Englishman
of the aristocratic type. , Mr. Crooks
dropped his "h's", manipulated his
monocle, and maniicstcd a certain
hriliiancy or ideas, like a true Brit-
isher. Mr. Crooks’ acting at ﬁrst
was slightly strained but he develops
ed his part until his opening scene
in the last act was one oi the best
pieces of acting in the entire play,

Jerry played his part in a likeablei
manner. His slowness and even

with the quickness and uneven tem-
ner oi the leading lady,

Mabel Neely, as regs conceited
and snohhish cousin, was in her cha
actor throout the play and never tor
,a moment allowed the audience to ior-
get that she was a pampered and lazy
daughter or the idle rich. When about

a married man she was saved by Peg,
and her change of attitude toward

were portrayed very well by Miss
Neely. Grace Martin as Mrs. Chic-
hester was good in her part. She kept!
the haughty reserve oi the mother
thruout the play.

Mark Enter: and ‘Mildred Scott
made real parts out oi the servant
roles. Hary Rench as the lawyer did
well and contributed to the play by
explaining the,plut of the story in the
iirst act by giving the particulars of

Mary Harris as technical director,
Alyce Wilson and Donald Tllorup, as
