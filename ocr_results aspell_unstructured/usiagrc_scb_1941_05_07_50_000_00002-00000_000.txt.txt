0 That Libe Problem

A great educator once stated that it” he
were building a college, first of all he would
erect the library; this he would follow with
the living quarters, and then finally the
classrooms.

Why this order 01' building? It is only
natural, because the libral'y,.even more so
than the university or college itself, is the
seat of learning- in our world today, for the
center of knowledge can be found in books,
books that are an avenue to a new world
for those who read them. That is if they

are able to read them, if their fellows give
them a chance.

Libraries throughout the world are noted
for their traditionally hallowed silence, the
quiet of their lonely rooms. Nat so our lir
brary. A little at a time, day by day,
throughout the year, the noise in the libe
has been growing until now at any time of
day or night there is a constant and monot»
onous roar going on. Students whisperin ,
or calling back and forth; couples cooing
about something or other; chairs scraped
and sonffled ill annoying rhythm; girls
slacking- around in high heels; boys talking
loudly in the entrance.

Is it right that the few people who really
wish to study have been driven from the
last remaining place for study? Our library
should be a means to a richer education ill-
stead of a more social center, a place to
make tomorrow’s dates and talk in disturbr
ing‘ undertones about last night’s.

But whose fault is it that this condition
exists? One certainly can‘t blame the li-
brarians, for they/ cannot bodily throw out
noisy students. They are forced to depend
on what normal moral power they have plus
student cooperation, and, having- lost that,
it is time something was done.

it is the students alone who can make
the library a place lit to study in. And if
the students are not themselves willing to
make our library a ti ue center of learning.
then appropriate action should be taken.

What the solution is, we do not profess
to know, but here lo a worthwhile problem
for our Student Council to take up. 11' some
students came here for an education. then
it is only fair that they should have the
best possible chance to get it.

by the audience.

A precedent was established
when Dorothy Tcrltcn, town Wo-
man, presented a dance, Spanish
in nature, in the confines of Her-
rick chapel. In the mind of this
reviewer, it is a good precedent
to setup, too. for if it is ac—
ceptable to hold pep rallies in
chapel, it is just as acceptable
to Witness a dance there.
