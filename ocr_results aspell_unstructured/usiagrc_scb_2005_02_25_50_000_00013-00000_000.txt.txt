Students put
budget petition
to faculty

Some profs ask for greater

budget input, changes in Capi-

tal Reserve Fund management
BY LINN DAVIS

In about aweek, several students plan to circulate a
petition among professors that demands greater disclo-
sure {rom college administration and trustees on budget
issues.The petition follows a letter by Cid Snmdirer ‘07,
Eric omwega ‘08, Ezekiel Hausfatlrer ‘05 and Emily
Iwuc ‘08 asking faculty to voluntarily accept a cut in
salaries.

The petition will call for increased openness about
budget issues with faculty and students, including an
annual pre-budget report to be published and distribuf’
ed in the fallThe ﬁrst draft of the petition requests that
the administration release information such as trends in
merit and needebascd aid, statistics on student debt and
spending on buildings and grounds, as well as a state
merrt of the basic assumptions made when crafting the
budget.

The students are also considering a 5' in at Nol-
len House later in the year, although this idea is only in
preliminary planning stages.

The original request that faculty drop their salaries
in order to decrease tuition has been abandoned. “At
this point I'm not going to ask professors to sacriﬁce
their salaries, because it turns out that tuition [increases]
and salaries are unrelated,"said Standifcr, principal aur
that of both the letter and the petition. “That Vlms basi»
cally a lie."

According to Standifcr, the letter sent on Feb. 21
began in response to comments made by trustees at
an open forum with students on Feb. 17. “A lot of rrs
rhcre were concerned about the tuition issue and pres-
sured the trustees as to why that would be damaging
for Grinncll," Standifcr said. “I felt personally that they
were very evasive and that they already had their minds
made up on the issue. When I pressed them for the rear
sons for the tuition increase, the only reason they could
give was that we [need to] maintain competitive salaries
to. professors.”

As faculty were quick to point out, however, telr
ured professors already recently adopted a shortrterm
graduated cut in yearly pay increases. As a result, assis-
tant ptofessors’ salaries could be raised and made more
competitive'compared to peer colleges, with the hope of
attracting new faculty.

“It was important to usth‘rethct the trrrstees were
going to give us nrore money [or not], this was the right
thing to do,"sar<l Mark Schneider, Physics. “That does
point to the wrlllngncss of the faculty to sacrifice for the
good orthe institution.”

The letter also cited a trustee remark that the board
would not be inﬂuenced by campus—wide student pro-
test but would be inﬂuenced by massive faculty discon-
tent.

Faculty budget input

However, how much sway faculty hold over the
general budget and how much sway they should hold
are debated issues.

Although there is no dispute that faculty have con,
trol over academic budgeting matters, several profes-
sors described the current amount or faculty inlluanca
on the overall budget as “nominal." Vicerprcsidenr or
institutional and budget planning Jonathan Brand disr
agreed.

“I acruany think the faculty is very active in the bud-
