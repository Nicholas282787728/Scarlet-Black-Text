g A plan to run a government in

George Turllbull is the current SGA
vice president and he is not going to
be listed on the ofllcal presidential
election ballot to be distributed on
Monday. Turnbull dropped his
nomination announcement into the
SGA box instead of in the box of Ad
ministrative ASSlstant Maris Natker's
box, Natker did not discover the :
nomination until the day after the .»
deadline and the Election Board
sidisequently ruled his nomination in-
valid because Turnbull had failed to ,

and he claims he can run the govern

Turnbull says that student govern-
ment“1imps along, year after year,"
and that it would do just as well if he
governs it without being on campus.

Turnbull emphasizes his lack of

. box. The board was also hesitant to
" add another Candidate to the ballot
. after the other candidates had been of-
licially Certified,

So Turnbull is running a writein
.campaign and one may wonder at the
seriousness of it all. Turnbull, who is

, going to participate in the Grlm’lellrln-
London program next fall, states:
“-I’m going to London whether I win or
not.”

, - . If he does win, Turnbull says he will
operate his administration irom

perience as vice president and views
the role of the president as that oi a
general policy-maker. He would send
“broad directives" from London
(donating his salary tor postage
costs), and let SGA operate as the set:
Vice organization he believes it is.

“I have a healthy sense of
cynicism," Turnbull says. “Why
bother with irills...xdeological crap?"

When asked about the problem of
his potential lack of visibility as all
SGA president-in-exile, Turnbull
replied: “I think i could always send
back black»and-white photos.”

Offering a pragmatic view of student government

' - ‘Paul Volker has a pragmatic view of
the SGA, “I know What will and won't
work," he claims. He Sees little reason
:to’lEaise hopes by promises of radical
change. Instead, he views the SGA as
a service organization which must
cater to the demands or interest

’ groups like the administration, the
faculty, and the various student
groups,

, Volker, who was asked to run tor the

presidency by friends, believes he can
do the best job of all the candidates
running, He cites his two year ex»
perience with the various aspects of
SGA, including his recent post as In»
itiative Fund Chairman.

One of Volker's priorities is to
create a “strong cabinet and hierarr
chy" including sharp people in the
chairs of concerts, films, and the In
itiative Fund.Whi1e he sees the role of

AUl. Volken

the president as one who handles the
important duty of managing the
budget. Volkcr says he wants to keep
the job in perspective.

“There needs to be a
lighthearteihless about it," tto s‘\ 5
“I'm iiol going to take it too serious

As tor other major issues. Volkel'
supports the idea of organizmg an ex
panded shuttle service and he would
like to improve the sewer. oliercd by

Volker emphasizes |he need to main-
lain the SGA General Budget source oi
lullds in order to support the many
small groups which depend on SGA for
money. The support given to such
things as Folk Dancers, the various
Cultural \\ eekends, and the other clubs
are “important to the Gl'illllell Ex-
perience,“ he says

“We Call'l allord to let those small
groups go".
