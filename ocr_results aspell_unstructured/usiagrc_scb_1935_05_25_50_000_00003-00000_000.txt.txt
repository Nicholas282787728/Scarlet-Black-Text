IMAGINARY SCENE IN THE COL-
LEGE TREASURER’S OFFICE or
NOT so IMAGINA. ' AS You
THINK lT IS.

The cast oi characters includes lhmt:
clerks and a student. The student has
just entered the door with an irked
look on his taco. He approaches the
iirst clerk.

STUDENT: See here, you sent me a
bill and charged me iorty dollars too
much. I remember paying it because
I have the receipt. (hands the clerk
the receipt.)

CLERK: (Taking the ~cteipt and
looking at it closely.) Yes, indeed, I.
see you have a receipt. (to he.soli,)
Now how in the world could we have
been so careless as to give someone a
receipt!

STUDENT: Weill

FIRST CLER Just a minute and
I will check this receipt with our own
books. (She turns to the 2nd Clerk.)
Jane, whcre were we keeping our
books on May 222

2ND Clerk: (Scratching her head.
and with a puzzled look.) Igust don't
remember oiihand. It seems to me
that we were keeping them on the.
wall behind the calendar during the
iirst part oi May. (Pause) But we had
to quit when they painted the wall.

3RD CLERK: (in a spirit at help.
iulncss) then we started keeping them
on the iloor with chalk.

2ND CLERK: How long did we keep
them there?

3RD CLEERK: I doubt ii we have
any records around May 22., It seems
to me it was about (hm. time we ran
out oi ink and had to usc water tor
a couple oi days.

The student has begun to get a hunt.
ed look in his eyes and is tumbling
in his pocket,

2ND CLERK: (To student) It really
doesn’t make much diiierence, you
know. We haven't had a pen or pen—
cil here ior iour years now.

1$T CLERK: (Hopeiully) We've had

an eversharp ior ever so long. (She
sighs) But we haven't had any lead
in it since '29.
/ The student planks down forty dol—
lars with a wild cry and dashes irom
the The three clerks stand
and stare at each other with aston—
ishment. Finally:

IST CLERK: (To her mates) Now
doesn’t that heat all! These college
kids act crazier than anyone I ever
knew. (She sighs) Oh well, boys will
be boys. (Briskly) That will be all
ior today girls. Tomorrow we’ll all
meet at the tennis courts. Mr. Phelps
wants to see ii he can’t keep the
books with a stick on the clay courts
until the next big rain.
