Opinion Editorial

Traditionally, new editors get to use this
space in the first issue to try to deﬁne their
plans for the semester they will spend run
ning the paper 7 to tell the readers what
they hope to accomplish. Now, it’s my
turn, Hoo boy.

Everyone seems to agree that Griilnell is
one of the best schools of its kind, You
would expect that we'd be able to turn out
a paper reﬂecting that,

Yet the S & B has been an object of
ridicule as long as any student here can
remember. Why? Surely we can do better
than that.

The most obvious problems are
mechanical: things like typos, misspellr
ings and grammatical errors, That oiiends
people. It suggests shoddy workmanship,

More often, writers are. more familiar
with academic writing than with

newswriting 7 and the two are very dir-
ierent. A strunk ti White standard
paragraph looks pretty iorbidding in four
column newsprint.

See? Two sentences to a paragraph.
What would happen it I tried this in a
designated writing course? Diiierent rules

apply.

Anyway, we will keep a tighter hand on ’

editing in the hopes oi improving the s e
B's appearance. That's a good iirst step in
turning out a quality product. .

We had a little more trouble iiguring out
what to do with content, but after talking it
over at the iirst meeting. we havc a couple
or ideas,

You'll be seeing a little more emphasis
on local news. The college is part oi the
Grinnell community. but I see almostcoin»
plete isolation between town and campus.

Where We’re Going. ..

More students never go iarther irom cam-
pus than McNally‘s.

Not that we plan to force iarm stories on
the student body. There 5 no point to that
But l do believe that the campus position
in the Grinnell community obligates us to
take some interest in the aiiairs oi the
town.

i also think we need more emphasis on
local politics a that is. a more construc-
tive, ii not necessarily more iriendly. rela-
tionship with son. Part oi a campus
paper’s role is to evaluate and. it
necessary, criticize the periormance oi the
student government But the squabbling
that criticism resulted in last semester‘ is
pointless.

National and world politics have a”place
here. but we plan to deiine that place more
narrowly than beiore, We will be acting as

a iorum or opinion in those areas. but will
seldom generate any-oi our own when an
issue does not pertain to the campus in
some way As a campus paper. we don’t
have the resources to generate comr
prehensive news and editorials on
anything but community issues.

The most important change. though.
needs to come from the student body. For
all the people who complain about the
quality oi the s 81 B, very iew show up ior
our staff meetings, We don't get many let-
ters. either.

So write us. Complainl But let us know
what you wantand don t want That kind of
exchange is necessary it we re going to
build the s 5: B into a quality paper.

. . . And Where We’ve Been

by Mike Cleary
During the January 27 meeting or the
Finance Committee a proposal was made
‘to cut all funding for the Scarlet it Black
from next semester's budget. The proposal
was made with the intention of showmg the
campus community what it would be like
not to have a newspaper. .
How did it occur that this idea would
even be considered? Relations between the

ShB and SGA deteriorated severely last _

semester.

According to one student. their conﬂict
had no clear beginning. Apparently. SGA
criticized an article in the 83:8, the 8&3
responded, one thing led to another and the
56:3 and SGA iound themselves righting

SGA members cited poor news and
sports coverage. biased articles, malicious
editorials. the low number of articles. and
uninteresting content. They criticized the
editor ior iailing to carry out the duties oi
the position

They were concerned about whether the
8&8 was fulﬁlling its function, which is to
report news to the campus community.
General dissatisiaction with the paper
among the student body supported their
view

The Ski} accused SGA of trying to force
its opinions upon the SM}.

At the end of the semester. SGA tried to
torce the 5&3 to print a final issue, The
5&3 argued that reporters were
unavailable during the week before finals.

Letters to

To the Editor:

Grinnell has always been known to treat
students fairly and on an individual basis,
However, to the administrative body. par-
ticularly the housing administration, this
treatment is only upheld if money is not in
question, The recent housing crunch had
caused the housing administration to plead
with students to leave campus, and the
students responded with an exodus so
great as to stretch the limits of the “Off
campus" allowance,

The housmg administration lost control
oi the number oi students leaving campus
letting oil one hundred and eightyrscven
students, thirty-seven more than the one

_ hundred and fifty limit

As a result. housing officials have been
told by the Treasurer's office to hold the
line on the number of “off»ciimpus”
students. and in holding this line the hous-
ing administration has become irrational.
slubborn. and downright ridiculous in con-
sidering the possibility or another student.
even a second semcster senior. to move otl‘
campus.

This attempt failed. and S_GA published the
Park Street Journal.

The chairman oi the Student Publica-
tlons and Radio Committee (SPKtR)
denied SGA the use oi the name Scarlet
and Black because he felt thatwould be too
controversial. irhe Trustees. who own the
ssh. had invested SP&R with the responr
sibility oi overseeing the management oi
the S&B.l

one SGA member said that this was the
attempt oi a frustrated sea to vent its
anger upon the 5&3. An 8&8 staiier who
attended the SGA meeting has said the at-
tempt was selfrserving and inappropriate.

SGA members. particularly those in the
Finance Committee, because they are
responsible ior allocating iunds irom the
Student Activities Budget. feel that they
should make sure that the money will be
used wisely. They icel that the SGA should
step in to prevent the problems with the
5&3 last semester irom ever happening
again

It has been argued that either SGA or the
administration should assume complete
control oi the see so that it properly
serves the campus community, used had
the power to hire and tire staiiers at will,
SGA could produce a quality paper. the
argument continues,

it seems unlikely that son will do this,
but it has begun to take action. Recently.
SPkR set guidelines which require the
sail; to publish a certain number oi issues

the Editor:

why are they holding a second semester
senior on campus? Well. the housing ad-
ministration did sympathize and ap-
preciate the problem oi one senior who will
have to pay over $350 a month in rent. but
was unwilling to “subsidize" this seniois
housing by allowing another to move on. a
move that would cost the school a whopp-
ing $500.

For a school that has a 61) million dollar
endowment. $500 is earned at 10% interest
in approximately 30 minutes. As a resultoi
their stinginess. and iascination with
money. they have overlooked the human
iactor oi a senior in a severe iinancial
situation and have turned students into
Just another number. as do the monstrous
state schools. that the administration so
sclirighteously condemns

one senior has bcen put in a severe
linuncial bind. which as I repeat. is zips
prc atetl and to which they are sym-
pathetic, but to which the powers that be
are unwilling to help s Mike Wallace 'Xii

on a weekly basis per semester.

This year the 5618 has failed to publish
issues the last week of last semester and
the first week of this semester. Previously.
the 5&3 has been able to do this. Yet SGA
now looks more iavorably upon the sails.
lts frustration with the 88:13 has subsided.
They feel its current editor will avoid the
mistakes of last semester and will produce
a better paper.

The motion to cut funding for the 55:13
was defeated. ’It was felt that if the 55:13
was not funded
ministration would take control of the
said. Approximately $8900 was allocated
for next semester's S&B.

Certainly the S&B staff must be held ac-
countable for what. it prints. But what can
students do to ensure that the Ski} staff
publishes a good newspaper?

It is difficult to effect Improvement of
the SKtB from outside There are questions
about the right of other students to in-

trust,

S&B know when it is not fulfilling its

The responsibility ior maintaining a

he? Can we then dictate to the paper what
it will do anti still expect improvement?

Perhaps better than setting standards,
one 5&5 editor points out that 5&8
reporters should be paid. as they are at
other colleges. He argues that this would
attract students interested in journalism
and motivate reporters to produce a better
paper.

General opinion about the paper is at its .
nr'idir. “We know it‘s a piece of shit." says
one student, He continued. saying uiat it
was good to have a paper anyway because
the administration has money, so it can afr
ford to print a paper and give students the
opportunity to write it

Worse than reflexive and forcible at-
tempts to improve the soils is lack oi con-

about its news, why should we have a stu-
dent newspaper at all?
