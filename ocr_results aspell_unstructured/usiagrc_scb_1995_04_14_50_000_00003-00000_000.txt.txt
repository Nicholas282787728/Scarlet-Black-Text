UAD Dining Hall, to many

South Campus residents,

personiﬁes South Campus.
Its i yncratic, inspiring confines
(wlticharcsodifferentfrom Cowles'
institutional, functional design) are a
familiar pan of the South Campus
residential routine, as are its person-
alities: Salidy, Sylvia. the student
workers.

But what‘s this? A new face?
Quad diners may have noticed an
unfamiliar woman, Jeanette Moser.
observing Quad operations during
meals over the last few days. Moser,
the new Assistant Director of Quad,

which means, by extension. she’ll
play a part in the lives of everyone
who eats there.

As Assistant Director, Moser’s
duties are many: aside from aiding in

Prior to Grinnell, Moser man-
aged two dining halls at the Univer
sity of South Dakota. She noted that
Grinnell has a different system than

the USD. South Dakota has a system
where “the manager stays in the back
room and does paperwork,” she said,
while she hopes that Grinnell’s sys
tem will let her be closer to the stu-
dents and the workers.

Maser said she favors this sort
of “up-front" management, which is
why she has been so visible in Quad
since she got here. Currently, one of
her main projects is getting to know
the Quad staffand their roles. Moser
said that, “I‘d hoped to meet some
people. Peoplesay ‘hi' and stuff,but
I think when people are working on
the serving line, they’re in kind ofa
hurry."

Moser replaces Nadeem E.
Siddiqui as AssistantDirectoronuad

PROTEST from page 1

istrzitive coordinator of KDIC, re-
gardingtheincidentand suspensions.
The actions of KDIC were in accor-
dance with KDIC’s written policy
and FCC regulations.

“At Grinnell, it's not what you
mean, it’swhaiyou say,"commented
one of the suspended DIS. Grinnel]
students take offense and make
judgements regardless of the con.
text of a statement, he added,
“whether they heard it or just heard
about it."

Clark mentioned another. simi-
lar incident which occured during
the late 80's when two DJs played an
offensive song on the air. The DIS
then verbally abused callers who ob»
lected to the song. These DJs were
also suspended.

Clark felt that the two DJs sus-

pended most recently were very
understanding.
SPEAK EASY

A Speak Easy followed the
Speak Bitter on March 12 at Harris
during which all were allowed to
speak at an open mike. Students
and one faculty member voiced their
reactions, concerns and possible
solutions to the problem.

One student reminded seniors
thatthey would be asked for money
after graduation as alumni. She
asked that they remember not only
that they can designate what their
contribution goes to but what hap»
pened during the weekend.

Attendance at both the Speak
Bitter and the Speak Easy was re-
markably high, The Speak Bitter
was originally scheduled to be held
in ARI-l 102, but had to be moved to

said PresidentPamelleerguson,who
felt that the weekend had some very
positive results.

“I applaud the various lines of
Communication," she said. “What
I'm really pleased about is that some
of the ominous silence is gone."

only caught a glimpse of the
Academy Awards when l was

home over spring break. Ber
lieve it or not, one ofthe acceptance
speeches really got me to think,
One of the documentaries that won
an Oscar was about gay teen sui-
cide, In the acceptance speech, the
ﬁlmmaker mentioned that one in
threeteenagesuicidesiscommitted
by a gay, lesbian or bisexual teen.
Although l am not sure that her
numbers are Correct. ldo know that
gay teens try suicide at an alarming
rate.

Why do gay teens kill them.
selves'.7 The teenage years are the
time when aperson makes the trans»
formation from adolescence to
adulthood. Bythetime mostpeople
become teenagers, they are mature
enough to understand their sexual-
ity. You realizethatyou are straight,
gay or bisexual, and there is noth-
lng you can do to change this fact.

Perhaps the most turbulent pe»
riod of the teenage years is high
school. High school students are
northe mostacceptingpeople. This
makes it hard to be gay in high
school. Most of the gay, lesbian
and bisexual students I went to
school with did not come out of Lhe
closetuntil after graduation. If they
came out in high school, chances
are they would have been assaulted
by another student. So gay students
wenttohigh school still in the closet
and were bombarded with gay jokes
and other anti-gay sentiment. This
could lead gay students to think,
“what’s wrong with me? Appar-
ently society thinks I’m evil. I
didn‘t do anything to create this
situation." Ofcourse, this thinking
could lead to thoughts of suicide.

Education can change the situs

 

Current

ation. High school students can be
taught that there is nothing wrong
with being gay. Being gay does not
mean you are not masculine. Being
alesbian does not mean you are not
feminine, There’s nothing to be
ashamed of about being gay. In
fact, homosexuality and bisexual-
ity are aspects of peoples lives in
which they can take pride. All this
information can be easily taught in
sex education classes,

There’s one problem with this
scenario —— it‘s very difﬁcult to
implement. Apparently some
people believe that being gay is
immoral. Althoughlcanﬂllupthis
whole newspaper with reasons why
I find this argument to be ridicu-
lous, I have learned to accept the
fact that people think this way.
People who hold this view can be
members ofthe school board, memr
bers of the faculty, and parents in
the district. Principals and superin-
tendents that are willing to consider
including topics in the curriculum
that say gay is okay are met with too
much criticism to pursue the issue.
Meanwhile, gay teens are killing
themselves.

In high school, we teach teen-
agers that drinking and driving is
not okay in order to prevent them
from getting killed in a car acci-
dent. Why can't we teach students
that being gay is okay so that they
don‘t kill themselves? It really is
that simple.

You can help get the right mes
sage out to high school students.
Research school board candidates
before you vote. You can even run
forthe school board afteryou gradu-
ate. Something has tobe doneabout
the suicide rate ofgay teens, or else
young people with the potential to
benefit society might not make it
passed their twentieth birthday.
