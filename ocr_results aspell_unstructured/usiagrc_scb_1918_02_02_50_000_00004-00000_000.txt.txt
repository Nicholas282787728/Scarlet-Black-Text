GRINNELL HAS HAD A
FULL TEAM DF DDAIIHES

Since Grinnell abandoned the sys~
tent of graduate coaches in 1001,
eleven mentor-s have led Grinnell inch
on the gri on. In that year Tratt

lt‘

ot Wisconsin succeeded the last of .

the graduate coaches. Harris and Cog-
gcshail. and for two years was fairly
successful.

Since their Griuucll has had Erick»
son of Wisconsin in 1903, Hamilton of
Grrnnell class of ‘90 in 1907. Andrews
of Yale 1908. succeeded by Daugherty
in 1909.

One ol the most successful and
host liked of all the coaches was A

tliur 11. Brown. who coached for the -

three years I910. 1911 and 1912. Name
crtou 01 Indiana was mentor- in 1913.
tollowed by Maturin Fisher in 1914.

In 1.01; Griiinell came into her own
an the gridiron under the coaching of
William U.
son of 1013 and 1916 the Minnesota
than was uriilormly successful, and
it is doubtful how long he would have
been here but for hrs untimely death
last winter.

Last spring Oscar Solem. another-
Minnesota man. coached [or a short
trine. but the war prevented his l’Cr
tririi this fall. "I‘lle athletic hoard se-
cured the services of Tollefsou,
teammate of McAlmou. That his syse

sults of the season. He has brought
