Pep Band to jazz up sports scene

BY CHLOE MORYL

If the baseball teams antics aren’t enough
for you at home basketball games, get ready for
the Grinnell College Pep Band.

“We feel that a pep band is a good addition
to Grinnell because pep hands are known for
being kooky, run and provide humor and spirit
to sports events," said Harry Krejsa '10, one of
the organization’s founding members.

Though this is Pep Band’s first year, the
concept is not new. “The idea has been kicked
around for years through jazz band, but no real
action has been taken until now," said Krejsa.

That's how trumpet player Ethan Struby
’10 became involved. “I played in jazz band last
year, but I didn't want to this year." said Struby.
“Harry was like, ‘Etlmn,l know you play an
instrument,’ SO I was like, ‘wcll, what the hell,v
and it's a lot more fun because we don't take it
seriously"

The relaxed environment is what Krcjsa
thinks draws a lot orpeople to Pep Band. One
or those people is trumpet player Zack Rider
'08. “Practices aren't a huge time commitment,"
he said. “And [Pep Band] gives me the oppor
trrnity to play some fun musrc."

Some of Pep Band's music includes “The
Final Countdown" and “Zoot Suit Riot." The
Music department does not offer ﬁnancial
support to studelttsrun music groups, so pur-
chasing the sheet music has come out of the
budget Pep Band requested from the Student
Programming Commrttce (SPC).

“The Music departlnent offers no help to
snrdent musical ensembles without professors,
so in terms of instruments, we just scroungcd
together whatever we had," said Klejsa. “Greg
VVailace and the athletic department were kind
enough to give us storage space for our equip-
ment.”

And the band needs storage space, especial-
ly considering its size. “it stat-ted with about 10
people, and then by word ormouth it doubled
in size," said Krejsat “We have also advertised,
and so now wt'r up to about 30 people and are
growing size dramatically,"

Despite the large number orstutlents, Pep.

Band is always open and welcoming more
members. For more intotrnation check [pepl

The Single Sock and OtherAdventures
ChapterVI
by Sarah Boy r
Beth returns from an unknown place and goes in
search of Clyde. She finds him drinking his sorrows

away at the bangln the bar she accidentally drops her
messenger bag and a skull—yes, a skull—rolls out.

Clyde let out an “ahhha” and jumped off
his stool to help Beth pickup her messenger
bag from the ﬂoor.

Surprised at Clyde’s yelp and his eager
ness to help Beth, James accidentally dropped
the glass he was wash’ng into the sink and it
broke into several pieces. “Damn,"he mums
bled under his breath, and as he bent down to
pick up the pieces he overheard Clyde say:

“I thought you’d taken care orit."

“I tried"

“We agreed you were going to dump it at
you know.“

“I tried." ‘

james peered over the counter. Beth had
that harassed, nervous look of a person who
has been able to mostly contain a bad situa-
tion but foresees the potential of it all to fall
apart very quickly. ,

Clutching the messenger bag to her
chest, Beth looked meaningfully at James,
and Clyde stopped asking questions. Clyde
sullenly climbed back onto his stool, adjusted
his hat and began to nurse his beer again.

james stopped staring, bent and pretend-
ed to restock the coolcr. Tile conversation
on the other side orthe bar grew silent, and
when he looked up after what he determined
to be an acceptable, unsuspicious length or

time, Beth and Clyde were gone.

Ignoring the several customers yelling at
him for another beer, James worked his way
through the newscrowded bar to the door.
Opening it, he stepped outside into the grav-
el parking lot and shivered as the November
wind hit his cheeks.

Beth and Clyde were talking just in the
range of the parking lot’s ﬂuorescent light.
James leaned against the wall and pretended
to be smoking a norrexistent cigarette and
enjoying a break from the smoky grime in
side and watched the indistinct gestures o
the odd pair.

Beth seemed on the verge of tears as
she gestured at the messenger bag lying on
the ground between them. Clyde munrbled
something, and Beth bent down, opened the
bag and pulled out what seemed to be some
kind otball. ,

James blinked as he took a deep draught
on his imaginary cigarette and then gasped. -
It was a skull.

They had heard him Beth looked up, her
free white and drawn, and Clyde turned, the
bags under his eyes strangely etaggetared in
the haltslight, James dropped the Cigarette
act and quickly opened the door just as Clyde
shouted at him across the parking lot.
