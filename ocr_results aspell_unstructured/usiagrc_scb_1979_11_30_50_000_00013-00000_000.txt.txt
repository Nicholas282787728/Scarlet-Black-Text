handed me the book, offered me a
chair, and then excused himself. say-
ing something about brussels sprouts
and French literature I wasn’t paying
much attention as I was already
devouring the contents oi the
somewhat moldy scrapbook.

The rirst page revealed a picture oi
a Greek philosopher, and the quotation
“And you too shall boogie." The
philosopher was Davidicus Blattus,
who dabbled in astronomy as well as
philosophy. The quote was King
James Old Testament it ever I saw it.
The explanation on the lollowing page
stated that because Einstein was such
a dancing fanatic (most of his dancing
was done when he was alone in his
laboratory, though it was said he
would venture a iew steps when in a
crowd if he thought no one was watch-
ing), he admired Blattus’ belief that
”Though one may sutier the
outrageous wrath of those who believe
otherwise. it should be that any man
may shake his bootie without fear of
retribution. Anything less is oppresV
sinn,” This was getting interesting.

The next page contained a picture of
Einstein sitting on the shoulders of
another man (McDufi), and dropping
two objects from this height. The
descriptive paragraph that accomr
panied this photo explained that this
was a picture of the demonstration of
Einstein’s “Falling Dessert Theory.”

It seems that Einstein was under the
impression that Twinkies [all to the

earth taster than any other dessert or
snack because of the strong attractive
forces between the earth alid the
creme filling He was proven wrong,
and blamed the results on McDuff, exs
plaining that his “squirming about"
caused a reversal of attraction in the
objects. This was to be the first of
many differences in the scientific
beliefs of the two friends

I found page 37 very interesting.
Pasted on the page were two
somewhat similar pictures (the kind
of “before and after” shots one sees in
polyethylene hair transplant ads) The
ﬁrst showed Einstein standing next to
an old man, the second with a much
younger companion. The explanation
stated that these were the photos sub-
mitted by Einstein as proof of his
“acceleration and aging” hypotheSis.
He stated that as one traveled at

speeds approaching the speed of light,
he woul ecome younger (as time

would pass more slowly, relative to

the passage of time on earth). He also
went on to theorize that once traveling
at speeds beyond the speed of light,
not only would one become younger,
but he would also attain his ideal
weight tor his height The theories
were abandoned when Einstein failed
to explain why the person standing
next to him in the second picture was
not the 85-yearrold from the first, but
in fact a za-yearold woman named
“Cookie.”

Thumbing through the rest of the
book, I found two more interesting
stories. The first was an explanation
of Einstein’s original theory of the
“Black Hole." ta phenomena now

torce that not even light can escape

black hole was “not unlike a medium
sized inverted dunce cap, from which
nothing but supermarket music may
escape."

An anecdote followed which stated
that during an excursion into a
neighborhood market while visiting
friends, Einstein suddenly became
aware oi the background music and
panicked. Gripping the shopping cart

ing, “The Black Hole! I am in the

composure and went on to revise his
theory to that accepted by modern

science today.

with Einstein's formula; “E=mc2.”

Dear Dali: As a member of the 38:8
staff, 1 have reviewed your article
“8&5: Bogus and Sell-righteous," and
frankly your criticisms are well~taken.
We have been guilty of bigotry, egos
tripping, sell-righteousness, pretenr
tiousness. etc Yet, as they say, Rome
wasn't built in a day We will just
have to try harder in the future.

The question i would like to leave

at Grinnell? Surely you don’t mean
the 8&8. You expressed evident glee
in attempting to put the nails in our

while the 8&3 may be in bad taste, at
least it is not bland (like the 5&8),
And while we may have chosen the
Wrong issues. we at least have found
and printed some issues. Your

testimony of those with Einstein at the
time of his death states otherwise. “At

stein opened his eyes, and when asked
it there was anything he wanted, he
again closed his eyes, and replied, ,
‘Hooskerdoo,’ smiled, and was gone.”
When I questioned McDuff about this
he excused himself, saying he had to
answer a phone. He left the room and
