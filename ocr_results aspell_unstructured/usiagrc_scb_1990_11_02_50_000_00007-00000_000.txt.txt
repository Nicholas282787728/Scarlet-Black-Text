Computer System Generates Mass
Confusion and Inconvenience

In general, I’m proud of our
computer sysrem. As with SGA.
you don'treally have to understand
things very much to appreciate
them. Lately I’ve been pondering
our Vaxes a loL

You see,Iam ajunlorandlive in
a college-owned house. We had a
computer terminal installed irt a
room upstairs. and life was good.
Sometime during break, however,
it broke. I know that “broke” is
hardly the appropriate word. since
its lack of function is probablydue
to a few mis- directed electrons,
but for my purposes, it‘s broken.
Peoplewith lots of tools in suitcases
have tried to repair it several times
with little success.

So, in an effort to find out what
life was like before there were
computer terminals in every house,
I tried to find one on campus on
Saturday morning to check my mail
and printa few things. Carnegie's
computer room was closed. I
remembered seeing people
squinting atscreens in a small room
in ARH, so I entered the building,

marvelling at the fact that it was
unlocked. Then I learned that it
was unlocked because the alumni
who came to the building‘s
dedication ceremony would soon
betouring it. [was amazed at the
numerous potted plants that
suddenly lined the hallways.
Eventually, I found the “general
use“ computer room, which was
also unlocked only because of the
tour.

Ihavetoadmit,1wasimpresscd.
I walked past a dozen or so
Macintosheswithadomblelittleflsh
swimming across their screens.
Then I found some relatively
familiar “digital” keyboards and
attempted to log-on.

I figured out the new letter
codes at the beginning of this
year, 1 ﬁgured out the different
”local“ prompts at Burling, I was
astounded to find that I had to
ﬁgure outyet another way to logon
when in ARI-I. To make a long
story a little less long. it wasn't
easy logging-on to WordPerfeCtand
justlooklng at my directory. When

I was finally ready to print
something, the odier user in the
roomsaidthatthe prtntcrwasdown.
We searched for another place to
send our stuff, and we weren‘t sure
ifanyofthelocationswereworking
or unlocked

IfI couldhave anything] wanted
from Computer Services. what
would it be? Answer: One room,
justoneroom,withafew terminals
and a laser printer that would
ALWAYS be open. Twenty-four
hours a day, even over breaks.
Somcplace where I would always
know I could print and go pick up
my papers. Thatwould reallymake
me happy.

Plus maybe providing
upperclasspersons with buttons that
say, “Why haven‘t I learned
WordPerfectyeti BecauseI’m too
stubborn. that’s why."

Student "Nazis" Object
‘of Columnist's Scorn

The following wasprintedinthe
Albia Union-Republican in Dave
Paxton's column “Out on a Limb"
on OcL 13, 1990. Reprinted with
permission:

“...the young Nazis from
Grinnell College were certainly a
glowing example ofthc beneﬁts of
a “top" liberal arts education when
halfthcstudcntbodyshouteddown
an address by Gov, Terry anstad.

We keep hearing how Grinncll
College is among the nation’s best,
but after last weekend's display of
mob rule, you have to wonder
exacdy whatit is students are being
taughticcrlainly nothing
periainingtodcmocmcyorfrecdom
ofspeech.

Had a group of radical right—
wing fundamentalist pro-life meatv
eatingNRA membersshouteddown
a speech by Donald Avcnson or
someother ilbcml candidate, thrown
a rock through the window of his
local headquarters and physically
threatened his appearance on a
campus, you would have heard a
mightycryfromstudentsatGrinnell
College. Of course they would
have been right to protest.

But it’s okay for these (Iat-
headcd fascists to attempt to curb
andcontrollhecourseoffreespeech

whentheopponentisaconservative
Republican. Likeany fringe fanatiC,
they fervently defend the freedom
of speech—as long as the opinion
voiced is their own.

More frightening than their rock
throwing and physical threats is the
thought that these people will some
day be in responsible positions,
actually attempting to contribute
their ideas to society.

THE IRONY OF Grinnell
College students shouting down
Gov. Branstzld is in the subject
matter they picked to shout down.
Remember, these are students
whose parents have the financial
timber to send them to one of the
most expensive private colleges in
the nation. These people end up
doctors, lawyers and
candlestickmakcrs of the highest
social order. Gov. anstad was
born of dirt-kicking farmer stock.
who worked his was through a
public university and whose family
couldn’t even buy him out of
militaryserviceduringtheVietnam
war era.

Isn'titabidoddthatlhesesilver-
spooned fascist darlings would
attempt to bully Gov. Brarlstad on
his views of poverty, jobs and the
homeless?“

 

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Fernandez-McCarthy Responds to Anonymous Critic

“An ANONYMOUS SGA
computer board?” said a trustee last
week, “You’re just asking for it."

Yes, we are. Hopefully people
willcontinuctowrilelhingsanonyr
mously so that SGA can hear
complaintslhatwouldnototherwise
beheard. Irelishlhat. However,it
would be nice if all the complaints
were legitimate,as most are. I will
provide an example of an unusually
misinformed, if not bitter, comment
from the board; because I I do not
know who wrote the comment, I
will also respond in my column:

“First of all I would like to
express my distaste for Pedro‘s
irtsinuationthattheSGA-accessible
account was made possible by his
campaign promises. Whataload of
shit. Matt [Stippich] wrote the
whole damned thing. Whatthe hell
did you do, Pedro, stand behind
him and tell him when to hit the
spacebar? Get off your ego trip,
pal. Speaking of ego trips; when I
saw ‘From the President’s Desk’
[one of the options on the board] I
assumed it was from President
Drake, not Pedro. I personally feel
like Pedro is once again trying to
make sure that he gets in the
limelight. Take a chill pill, dude.
Why don’t you do some good and
keep your mouth shut about it?
If you want votes, and that’s the
impression I get, why don’t you
save your strength until elloction

(sic) time and try to do something
more than fill your resume?"

Wow. Youareone bitterpetson.
Who,exactly,doyou think needs to
this “chill pill" of yours. anyway?
You address several points in your
letter, so I'll start with your most
illogical assumption first I did,
indeed, promise during my
campaign last year that SGA would
computerizetheoffleiallointBoard
agenda and minutes. [don't recall,
however, claiming that I had the
computer expertise to do it At the
beginning of this year, Matt andI
met with Mark Miller, head of
software at GCCS, to discuss
creating an SGA NEWS board to
computerize the minutes. Matt, in
the meantime, created a temporary
board which proved to be far
superiortowhatComputcherviccs
had tooffer.soIdecidedtokeep his
program instead. I promised that
theminuteswouldbecomputerized,
and they were.

I don‘t see any attempt to
mislead. As a matteroffact,I went
out ofmy way to credit Matt. I
invite you to re-read the third sen»
tencefrom my column appearing in
the Oct. 12 issue of the Scarlet and
Black which very blatantly gives
Matt Stippich credit for creating
theprogram. Iwasn‘thiding,to use
your eloquent terminology, a
”damned thing.” Also, for your
informauon, I did not stand behind

Pedro
Fernandez-
McCarthy

him telling him to hit the spacebar;
I was sitting beside him. There‘s a
big difference.

You also address my apparent
“ego trip” because there is a menu
option entitled“me thePrcsidcnts
Desk.” Imagine my dismay when I
discovered that] had failed to elude
eagle—eyed observers such as
yourself with my attempt to
impersonate President Drake. One
would think that I at least had the
intelligence to write something
under thatheading matdidn’tsound
as if a student had written it. How
foolish of me!

Of course, in all seriousness,
somewould say thatitisarelatively
innocent mistake to expect that
when one logs on to a student
government account and sees such
a heading.poople would realizcthat
the “president" in question refers to
the SGA president, not the college
president. By the way. you might
be interested in knowing that it was
the object of your affection who
came up with the heading. not me—
let us not forget that l was only
directing him when to hit the

spacebar. I didn't inﬂuence the
content at all, I promise.

On to other matters: As many of
you are aware, a Hall Activities
Coordinator was charged with
contributingtothedelinquencyofa
minor before break. Apparently,
some student had beer poured on
him somewhere on North Campus.
Thtsstudentcalled the police. Upon
arriving, they saw a party “in
progress" and confiscated a keg.

I have a bone to pick with the
student who called the police. I
understand that it is a very
obnoxiousthingtohavebeerpoured
beer on one’s head. I, too, would be
infuriated. However, there are
avenues on campus through which
to channel your ire. You could

have gone up to the floor from
which the beer was poured and
complained to those responsible. If
you felt too timid to do that, you
could havecontacted the SA ofthat
floor, the RA for that hall or the
night watchman and have him put
you in contactwith oneofthedcans
immediately.

What all these options share
in common is that they could have
resolved the situation WITHIN the
college. By calling the police, they
forfeited an effective system of self-
governance for which we pride
ourselves. The end result:
somebody who did not pour beer.
from a hall other titan where the
beer was poured, will be facing a
court date soon. There’s justice.
