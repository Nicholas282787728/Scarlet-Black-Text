To Highlight ‘49- ’50 Season

The return of stage drama and
importation of Metropolitan
opera stars to act as guest solo—
ists with the Grinnell college
choir highlighted the announce-
mem today of next year's Cone
cert series.

Opening the season Monday,
Nov. 14, will be the Margaret
Webster production of Shakes.
peare’s “Othello.” Mar garet
Webster has been labelled “gen.
ius," by John Mason Brown;
“first lady of the theatre,” by
Richard Watts; “finest director
of Shakespeare this town ever
had," by Brooks Atkinson; and
“a tidy scholar and a realist”
who has made a clean sweep of
“musty academic cobwebs," by
George .lean Nathan. Her toure
ing company this year played
nearly 100 colleges and univer—
sities throughout the country,
receiving consistently Loperank
reviews.

Erick Hawkins and his dance
group will appear Tuesday, Dec.
6. Hawkins, according to the
Chicago Sun, “looks more like a
clipper ship than the popular
conception of a male dancer.”
Theatre Arts says of him: “He
is an artist with an honest and
sensitive imagination, a feeling
for original and dramatic ges—
ture, an individual style, and
something important to say."
The San Francisco Chronicle
calls him “one of the greatest
American dancers of the pres
ent day,” while the Columbus
Dispatch reviews him: “unflag-
gingly intelligent, arrestingly
personal, and intensely Virile.”

Violinist Carroll Glenn is
scheduled for Monday, Jan. 16.

Strong Foundation
Will Supply Loans
To College Students

The Henry Strong educational
foundation was established over
35 years ago by General Henry
Strong, a prominent attorney
who realized in later years the
value of his hard-earned college
education. The purpose of the
foundation is to make loans to
worthy students who desire to
complete their college training.

Each year funds are allocated
to a selected number of univer-
sities and colleges, of which
Grinnell is one. The amount so
allotted depends upon the funds
available and the needs of the
particular college.

Any student who is under 25
years of age, and who is an
undergraduate junior or senior,
may apply for the loan with
the campus student aid officer,
who sends the application to the
foundation in Chicago. Also,
sophomores who are in ,the
upper third of their class, and
graduate students whose finan-
cial needs are excessive, may
apply

A student may obtain a loan
not in excess of $600 a year, the
interest rate of 3% beginning to
accrue at graduation. Repay.
ment of the principal begins one
year after graduation, at which
time 10% must be paid. 20% is
due at the end of the second
year, 30% at the end of the
