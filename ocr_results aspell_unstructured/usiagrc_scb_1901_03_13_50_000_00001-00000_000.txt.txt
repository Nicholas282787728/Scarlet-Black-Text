Names Posted for Correction.

The names of the students as
they will appear in the new catar
logue are posted on the bulletin
board on Blair Hall. It is very
essential that the name of each
studentsltouldreceivecriticalscrilr
tiny and all errors be corrected,
particularly those of underclassr
men, the liability of mistakes in
the names of upper classmen not
being so imminent. All Juniors
must see that their majors are
properly catalogued. These matr
ters should receive immediate at
tention.

Western Wins by Three Points.

On a slippery ﬂoor, used every
week for dances, Grinnell met de-
feat at the [lands of Western in a
very evcnly contested game of
basketball. The court was made
in an old opera house, occupying
most of the ground ﬂoor, while
upon the stage and at the other
end of the hall were seated about
one hundred and ﬁfty spectators.

The game promised to be ex-
citing from the very beginning as
both sides had determined upon
playing fast from the ﬁrst blow of
the referee’s whistle. In less than
a minute a foul was called on Grin-
nell but Western failed to score
on it. A moment laterthe hall
was held between Smith, of West-
ern, and James, of Grillnell, near
Western's goal. The ball was
thrown up and Western made the
ﬁrst score by batting it into the
basket. Wilcox soon threw a has-
ket for Grinnell, making the score
2-2, and McKeag soon followed
with another.

Several fouls were now called
on Grinnell and two on Western.
Western threw one foul and im»
mediately threw two baskets ill
quick succession,malring the score
7.4 in favor of Western. The
crowd now became almost wild
and from this time on the yelling
and whistling and tin horns
drowned out every other sound
except during the time Western
was trying to throw a foul and
during the intermission between
halves. Until the end of the ﬁrst
half the program was foul Grin-
nell, foul Grinnell, until it seemed
that half the time was spent by
Western in trying to throw fouls.
She succeeded but once and the

 

half closed just after McKcag had
succeeded in caging the ball again,
leaving the score so in tavor of
Western.

Iii the second half thirteen fouls
were called on Giinnell and two
upon Western. Western threw
three baskets from fouls and two
baskets from ﬁeld. making a total
score of is points. McKeag sud
ceeded in throwing three more
baskets for Grinnell during this
half. making a total of 12 points,
and thus the game closed with the
score 1542 in favor of Western.
The features of the game were the
basket throwing of McKeag and
the umpiring of Larson.

The New Bartlett‘House Enter-
rains.

The elements seemed to have
leagueil together on Saturday
evening with the malicious intent
of frustrating any attempts at
social gatherings, but the guests
who partook oi the hospitality of
the New Bartlett house girls will
attest to the futility of their evil
inclinations. The house was well
ﬁlled by those so fortunate as to
he invited and the rooms were
very attractive in their ever-pleas-
ing scarlet and black decorations.
After a short period during which
the reception committee perform-
edits functions, the guests were
requested to give their attention
to a short farce. The purpose of
the players was “To Meet Mr.
Thompson.” The play was quite
apt in its local applications but;
both the periormersand onlookers
had to bear the disappointment
of not meeting the distinguished
gentlemen, after all.

This was followed by more
amateur theatricals in which many
of the guests took part. A repmr
duction of some of Gibson's char-
acters was very successfully car-
ried out, after which a few of the
dark deeds of the Girls’ Senior

 

club were laid bare and the cul-
tured behavior of the members of
the cushman club was repro-
duced. Then a pantomime was
given portraying the devious love
affairs of a certain maiden. The
entire program was very pleasing.
Light refreshments were then
served and the guests departed,
carrying with them memories ofa
very pleasant evening

For a New Opera House.

The following clipping from
yesterday's Hem/d will carry
good news to many college peo—
ple:

Last week the ﬁrst papers were drawn
up whereby H. W. Spaulding for the
Spnuldihg Mfg. Co. secures possession
of the corner occupied by the Mnnitou
House. The purchase includes 100 feet
of ground and the hotel, purchased of
the John Brown heirs, the consideration
being 34,000. The transfer will he made
us soon as the papers have been properly
signed by the heirs. The avowed pur-
pose of the purchase is for the construe
tion or a ground ﬂoor opera house, nltho
in conversation Mr. Spnuldinp states
that he does not expect to build the pres-
ent season. He says, however, that any
party that wishes to build at ones can
have the lot at the price it cost him for
that purpose and for no other.

There has been considerable talk the
past two years of organizing a stock come
pnny tor the erection of an opera house
ML Spnulding would gladly become one
of such in company if the business men
will tnke hold with him and effect such
an organization. In such once the house
could he built this season. Otherwise
it would doubtless have to wriit until
1902.

Theetock company proposition will be
discussed quite ﬁenernlly this woeir. Thu
ndvaotnges of a modern, commodious
opera house capable of seating 1.500 peo-
ple. with slarge stage and entirely mode
pro in plan, are conceded by all. A new
one is no immediate possibility if buair
nose than take hold of it. Otherwise it
must. wnit another season.

Progressive Peanut Party.

Miss Edith Clark and Miss
Merta Johnson entertained very
pleasantly a company of friends
at the cottage on Saturday after-
noon. Although the weather was
not all that could be desired, with
very few exceptions the invited
guests were all present.

After a merry bit of conversa
tion the company was seated at
small tables to participate in a
progressive game of peanuts.
Every one was furnished with a

hat pin and was told to spear as

Dual Gymnasium Meet with
S. U. I.
To the many pleasures which

our gymnasium has afforded us
in the past year may be added
that of a dual gymnasium meet
with the State University. It is
to take place on Friday evening,
March 22, at the men's gymnasi-
um, This is not the old Y. M. C.
A. contest but something entire-
ly new. Each institution is to
have six men, no man ‘being al-
lowed to enter more than three
events and the decision of the
judges will be given immediately
after each event, the points to be
counted up much as in a track
meet.

The team, which will represent
Grinnell, will wear the monogram
"G. G. T.," and thc‘winner of the
most points for Iowa College will
receive an honor “G”.

The work will far excell that of
the home contest since some of
the men have been assigned to
new apparatus and are achieving
excellent results. Then too. the
element of competition will be
greater and will make the contest
more exciting. Next year it is
thought that this will develope
into a triangular meet betwecn
S. U. I., Drake and Grinnell.

Library Research Work.

It is a very signiﬁcant fact that
instructors are more and more re
quiring research work. This
especially true of the major, post
major and higher elective courses;
and indicates very plainly that
the tendency in higher education
istogive thestudentasmuch work
with original material as possible.
It is therefore very important
that scientiﬁc methods should he
acquired in order to systernatize
and facilitate this study. In this
connection it is interesting to
notice the work of the Post Major
History class (b). it is the pur-
pose of the course to give the
student ~scientiﬁc methods of
Historical Study, with practical
exercises in Historical Criticism .
