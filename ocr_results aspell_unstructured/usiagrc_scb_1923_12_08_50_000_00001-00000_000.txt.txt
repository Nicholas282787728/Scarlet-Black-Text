RUSSIAN GOVT. STRONG
COMMUNISM SUCCEEDING

Youth and Peace Movements Are
Gaining Headway 7 Sees
Hope for Future,

“Communism is a perfectly
Christian term, don’t dodge it," do-
clared Dr. Sidney Strong, who has
recently returned to this ' country
from studying old World conditions.
He addressed the student body at a
long chapel and again at 11:20 TueSr
day morning. In the disorder and
class. as in communism, Mr. strong
sees great promise for the future.

He pointed out the signs of hope in

Europe today. the most important
of which is the Youth Movement. The
young people of Germany and Russia
are becoming interested in out of door
life, in reform‘s against the use of
alcohol and tobacco, and in a general
revolt against prevailing social and
political conditions. "Thank God for
the movement," Dr. strong exclaimed,
“Join it.” ‘
' The reformation of the Russian
Orthodox church, in which the Soviet
government eflectcd a separation of
church and state and abolished the
monasteries, and the Rllssiu'n revel»
ution itself indicate brighter days
ahead. “The Russian rcvolutian,"‘he
asserted, "ranks ’along with the
French revolution and our own Amer
ican revolution, as an\ agent of
releasing creative energy. The Rus-
sians are seekiug, per ups blindly
and cruellty, for a government by
the workers."

A great good, he believes, will
come out of the issue betweu ind‘ id-
ualism and socialism. “Europe is the
,hattlefront of the world today; "Amen

~ ice, the recuperativc force in this
struggle."

Dr. strong saw other sources of
confidence in the growing peace
movement, the increasing number of
women in public life and the fresh
impetus which has been given to the
organized church.

"Most of the things said about the
German people are not true,” he
declared. “They are not nuns. The
common people were no more respon—
sible for the war thanxycu people
were. If you could sce there faces
as they sit in the music halls, you
would not believe evil of them, I
want you to‘ love theml"

He described the suffering and um
dernourishment of the Germans.
"Let's get together quickly," he de—
clared. We have the strength and
the money; don’t let our prosperity
ge to our heads, let it go to our
hearts."

He defined the present Russian
communism as a state of social equal.
ity since the abolution of titles. work-
el's' franchise, of communal life in
some instances, and of a dominance
of state capimlism, limited by areas
in which private capitalism flourish~
es.

To prove that the Russian people
are thoroughly in accord with the
soviet government, and particularly
with the school system, be quoted a
peasant, who said. "We used to he
taught tear of God and obedience to
the czar, Now we are taught of the
fatherhood of God and the fellowship
of nations."

Dr. strong also spoke Thursday eve~
ning at the Faculty Club.

Each Member Will Give Extended
Report Upon Some Phase of
Newspaper Work,
Although primarily exponents of
the printed word, the members of
the Grinnell chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi have broken from their chosen
field far enough to plan a series of
talks by the members of their group
when they meet at their semi-monthly

sessions ad the Hotel Monroe.

In the past the program has taken
a rather dcsultory course. relying
largely on the common interest of
the members for matcrial for di5r
cussion. lint under the new plan
cach man is given an opportunity to
state his preference of a subject in
which he is especially interested. The
committee in charge of the program
has endeavored to coordinate them
into a program which will be as com-
prchensive as possible. Discussion
always follows each talk, thus insur—
ing the individual participation of
each member as under the old sys-
tern.

The plan has already been tried
out successfully at the last meeting
when Arthur C. Kcmble gave a con—
centrated history of journalism. '0th-

Botany Department
Receives Plant Gift

The Botany department has lately
received as gifts two interesting plant
collections. One 01 them is an as-
sortment of cacti and netrlfied wood
from Colorado sent by Homer Tin-
dall, '25. The other collection is eX<
tremely interesting since it came all
the way from China. It consists of
some very rztre plants from the Island
of Hainftn of! the Southern shore of
Asia. Some especially ﬁne speci-
mens of the rare club-mosses are in
this lot. Marjory M. Monlger, '13, is
the sender of this Welcome gift.

 

W

Grinucll football followcrs have'no
reason to bc disappointed in the recs
ord of the past season, Although the
number of games won was compara-
tively small, that is really a minor
point. Statistics prove that the Gi'inr‘
nell team was on a par with the best
teams of the country.

For instance, the Pioneers heat
Washington 15 to 2, and Washington
hcat Missouri 13 to 6. Furthermore,
Missouri tied Nebraska. giving Grin-
nell a 21 point lead over the Corn-
huskers. But Nebraska beat Notre
Dame 14 to 7, and Notre Dame beat
the Army 13 to 0. Therefore, Grinnell
has 41 points against the Army, but
the Army and Navy tied. so the Pio~
peers have the same lead over ,the
Navy.

The Navy and the state University
or Washington play an intersectional
postseason game, either Christmas or
New Year's Day. Washington has one
of the strongest teams in the West,
but according do the above figures,
the Navy Could lose to Washington
do to o. and Grinnell could still win
from the western team.

Humorous Complications In Play

Did you ever stop to think that you
did not choose your parents? John

was going to lose his dignity because
of the fact, so this is what he said:

"Did I ask to be born? Did I ask to
be born? Answer me that. I didn't

and ynu've got to put up with me.

This is only one of the many hum—

and characters are a mingling of
every Lype of emotion. For instance,
Bice is a mixture of undying devotion,

always takes a cold both before her
work begins. The open—mouthed cook.
the frozen—faced Jap, the Consultantivc

dashing widow, and the homerloving
husband form a glorious background
for Madame's ravings and operative
tactics. her exits and her entrances.

heard the Flonzalcy Quartet last
night. We had come expecting per-
fection in their performance, and we
found it.

Criticisms on the sameness of their
program. and the lack of variation
in their interpretation have been heard
from those who have witnessed ther
previous p'erformances, but the ar-
tistic mastery and technical skill of
the quartet have not been question-
ed.

It is difficult to catalog the qual»
ities which distinguish the work a!
this quartet, In the first place, its
personnel has suffered only one
change since its organization in 1903,
which fact accounts, in part, ’for
their perfect unity of ensemble. Each
member is an individual artist, pose

instrument.

been remarked, is not in the pyra»

Each composition is a mastel‘pice
under their fingers, securing as
they do purity of tone and exquisite
shading.

The program contained two well
known quartets. the G. Major of Hav-
dn, and a Schuman, op. 41, No. 3.
To these compositions the quartet
brought their mature gifts of inter-
pretation and execution.

A theme with variations by Tancicw
was given excellent’ redition. and the
Adagio movement of a Dvorak quartet
used as an encore, was a perfect tone

The large audience was quite recep-

was excellent music, and gave the
artists proof of their appreciation.
