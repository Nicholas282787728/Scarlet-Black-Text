out until.
Arthur .I. Baliour recently addressed
the students at Edinburgh University
on “the art oi public speaking," Many
a! the.things which he said are inter--
esting not only to Eligisllmell
orator-s. but to Americans and students
everywhere. Public speaking in his
opinion, is the art of conversation rai-
sed to a higher level; that the real virr
tues oi'puhlic speaking are closely
akin to those' oi conversationzvsimr
plioity, directness, vivacitr. There is.
we learn, a decided change {mm the
style or dity years agu4the pompous,
ranting method or that dey would now
produce nothing but a laugh. Elocur
tion should be thoroughly studiedi

and

but one must distinguish hetween the
art of elocutinn and the art or nrtiui-
ness ot elocutlonists‘tl'icks at geSr
ture, raising or lowering of the voices.
etc. rilr. Baltour gave it as his decis—

ion that, all rules and tricks of speech

aside. the personality or a spenirer is
the paramount consideration.

We hear so often that oratory is on
the decline. that this testimony {rum
nrr, Balfour is encouraging.
There is no doubt that oratory is
changiilgithe heavy, digniﬁed style
would not be snocessi‘nl nowLa-days,
It is an easy, but iorcerul and convincs
Ing oratory that appeals to us today
—whnt Baltonr would call “sublimate

most

ed conversation."
tar-distant when “the spoken Word"
will count [or nothing; its own {recur
liar inﬂuence and charm can never be
lost. The wonderful growth _or news-
papers and other periodicals in recent
years has done much tn minimize its
power; but the presence or the living
men, the magnetism or his personality
will always do much for the temporary
inﬂuence or the nuncupatiyc over the

written discourse.—Oberlin Review,
