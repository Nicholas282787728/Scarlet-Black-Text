Attend A Reunion
At Military Camp

Lieutenant B. J. Carney Acts as
Toastmaster — Speakers
Laud Grinnell

The following. written by one of the
Gi-inucllians at Camp Cody, is a coin-
plete account of the Grinnell banquet
held at Deming on the Gth of January:

A ﬁne display of Griunell Spirit in
Grinnell men was found in a Camp
Cudy reunion held Sunday evening,
January 6th, at the Harvey House,
Deming, N. M, which thirty alumni
and former students attended.

The men, ofﬁcers, noii-eoinniissien-
ed officers, and privates, gathered
from nearly every branch at service in
the 34th Division, met in the dining-
room of the hotel and partook of an
excellent ﬁve-course hanquet served
at a long and pi-ettily decorated table,
The “mess” was or surpassing goody
ness and the men were a lively crowd
as they recalled old times at the Anna
Matei-gléon miles away.

After the last course was served,
Lieut. )3. J. Carney, acting toastinas-
ter, introduced the different speakers
of the evening, who,.as they were
called upon. gave informal speeches
and as a whole lauded Grinnell4Grin-
nell friendshipiand Gi-innell Spirit
as it is being carried into the great
world war. Lieut. R. L. llleClai-en urg-
ed the men to "soldier" and paid a
beautiful tribute to his former coach,
Wm. U, McAlnion, and urged that they
show the “ﬁghting spirit" as he did
Plans were made for a vermin
ganization of the men in this di on,
and meetings of the Grinnell Club are
to be regular affairs.

Paul J. Case '02, a re ‘dent of Deni-
ing, was the only civilian present.

Notes on the Banquet

Lieiiteant Wiltamuth said the bunch
sure carried the Grinnell Spirit, which
tacked on to the spirit of the bayonet
aught to give the Germans itcene

"Smoke" Brown looked the bunch
over and remarked, “Nearly every
man was famous for something or 0th
er when he was in school,”

“Red" McClarcn made some ﬁery
statements, true hilt too strong for the
S. & B., even though the diningrl'oom
ci-eu heard it all.

BHlllESE ‘Y’ MAN IN ﬂllAPEL

Don’t Give a Superﬁcial View of

Western Life Is Warning

ilr. Chuan, traveling secretary of
the Chinese Students' Young Men's
Christian Association, spoke in chapel
Tuesday.

He pointed out the danger that Chi
llese students studying in this country
might return to their own land with
"an incomplete technical education.
and a superﬁcial view of western civ-
illzation."

"it the Chinese are given opportllr
nity to absorb the best moral ideas,
they will become a great inﬂuence,"
he said.

“If they develop this moral leader-
ship from the best you can give them,"
he continued, “the day will soon come
when China will rise, and will join
hands with the United States, not in
domination of the far East, nor the
supremacy of the West, but for the
great task of making the world safe,
