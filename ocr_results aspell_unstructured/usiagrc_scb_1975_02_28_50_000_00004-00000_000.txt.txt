What God, mother and apple pie are to national elections,
apathy, academic pressure, and a sense of community are to
SGA elections. They become tried and true phrases that are
suppose to strike a sympathetic response from the audience.

Such phrases provide the rhetorical continuity to all
elections that make it hard to distinguish one year‘s
Volkswagen model from another..

It is true that apathy, academic pressure, and a sense of
community are of a more substantive nature than God,
mother, and apple pie. The arguments run basically along
these lines.

Students aren't as active as they used to be. The days of
student power are gone. What is wrong with the student
body? Why the tranquility on campus?

Noninvolvement in student government is used as the
gauge of student involvement and»or apathy. The campus is
blessed with activists. They are gay, women, and members of
the Third World Group who rest upon some cause, trying to
gain, firstly, attitudinal changes and, secondly, encourage
structural changes. They find opposition to their ideas
locally, further binding the group together.

The trouble with SGA is that it is seen by the students as

an institution of preservationipreserving those gains
obtained in the late sixties from administrative consoiracv.
Its cause is to hold on to what we've got which is not as
attractive as those of the other groups. More time is spent
maintaining rather than changing. The cajoling plea of
apathy by student government officials is perhaps a voice
crying in the wilderness of the bureaucratic jungle. Students
are active, but not necessarily in the channels SGA has
constructed. Apathetic to student government yes, but on
the whole? That is another consideration.
, Then there is the illusive “sense of community” where the
antagonistic tendencies of the faculty, and the ad-
ministration towards the student are enumerated. Most
often our community does not even include the Building and
Grounds workers. In the sense of time spent at the in-
stitution, B & G is the school. Students, faculty, and even
college presidents come and go, but B & G always remains.

We are at the essence a community based on evaluation.
Students are evaluated by their professors, faculty members
[particularly of junior rankl quiver at what ill news the
Institutional Grapevine might convey. Community
judgment is rendered on the performance of the members of
the community.

A couple of faculty members during the recent elections
pushed the ill-fated campaign of Prof. Clyde Clutz for SGA
president. Though formulated in jest, Prof. Clutz’s is
campaign platform is indicative of many of the feelings of a
faculty community, Among his points were—

Reduce academic pressure on me iacully by recognizing lnsi may are not only
"professors” but human homo and should nol be lodged solely by me corn.
pelcnce in lne classroom Sludenls should be encouraged to lake classes irom
mediocre iacully members so lhsi Ihe social bond and sense or commumly is
enriched

Facully should have lull psrily on siudeni malrlcuislion slndcnls should be
reconsrdered every lwo years. Thls consideration should not be rcnlincd in
academlzs pol include such issues as personality, Iempermeni and deSlre.

The points have a familiar ring of lunch table con»
versation. Students are not the only parties interested in a

sense of community” other han the academic one.

Finally, the illfated and devastating question of academic
pressure. That, like God, we will leave the Dean to tell us
about.

Moving out,
moving up

To the Editor:

Last week's edition of the Sxdi
inadvertently revealed another
veiled indication of misplaced
administrative priorities. In
reference to the issue of dorm
renovation, Bob Jacobs was quoted
to the effect that the task oi
renovation is under way and
will take but a mere live to six
years to complete. By that time,
perhaps the college will have to
pay students to partake in this
integral part of the Grinncil exr
perience Within the same issue of
the 5&8, mention is made of the
new building program to be
completed within six months, a
plan which will provide for more
office space ior the college's
massive administration and
service bureaucracies. Student

offices (Hainesrilamesl in the
Summer of i971 at a cost of

Who pays ior these decisions?
Who has input into them” Perhaps
this is another toll oi the general
phasingcui of student input in the
operation of the college, When
decisions are made by ad-
ministrators, the whims oi the
bureaucrats take precedence over
the needs of studcnts, those to
whom the college owes its very
existence.

In addition, during the currcnl
budget year, the students are being
iorced to pay for lavish
‘coronation' oi the college's top
administrator, and for two ox.

‘famine’ and “wild West’ weeks.
Meanwhile. the faculty, the real
work force or the institution suffers
thorough cutbacks. How many
faculty members did it cost to lcnr
down the women's gym? the
Colonial Theatre? And how many
in give all oncampus staff new
offices in the past lour years?

Student and faculty are now
having to pay the costs of sellr

For criticism’s
sake

To the Editor:

I am writing in reference to a
previous art criticism by R.
Cleaver of the last exhibit in
Scheaffer Gallery, To an art
major, I was offended by the
shallow analysis that was so poorly
disguised by the intermittent use oi
technical words. To any student,
the article pretty much stated that
the exhibit would not be worth
seeing. A good critic would invite
the public to judge for itseli
whether or not an exhibit is worn
thwhile,

My main criticism of R.
Cleaver‘s article is within his
description (or lack of) what the
two artists (M. Van, M. Zirklei
were trying to accomplish, To
ignore the experimentation. the
concern with space and openness
of each canvas was a great
tragedy To condemn M. Zirkle for
being too conscious of her art to the
point or intrusion was yet another.
lf one is creating a piece, be it a
sculpture. drawing or Jewelry or
painting, is not one also cone
sidering that piece to be ones on n
form oi art expression?

The entire article reminded me
oi someone who has never played
basketball but knows that there is a
ball. court. players, etc, involved
and therefore feels justified to
express some kind oi an opinion,
rm not impressed by n few
common art terms thrown together
into a criticism ”for Criticisln’s
sake.” What has gone into each
piece on display cannot possibly be
fully appreciated by many But
speCliically in reference in R,

Cleaver’s last paragraph, the full

Many people hold this position
regarding regulatory agencies: in
fact, this statement stands out only
because it was made by Dr.
Herbert Ley. Jr. a short time after
he was relieved of his job as the
Commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration. How can this
be? Everybody knows that all the
food we eat is carefully inspected
by that great Omnipotent being
otherwise referred to as the FDA,
Well. the fact is, the FDA cannot
possibly inspect, guarantee, and
test all tiic products that the
American Consumer comes Into
contact with This does not even
seem to he the complete fault of the
administration; [or example.

the FDA; the worth of the food,
drug, and cosmetic companies it
oversees amounts to more than
$250 billion, The food industry
alone includes over 50,000 in-
dividual manufacturing firms.

No doubt everyone has heard
some rumors about the Secret
impurities oi hot dogs or peanut
butter, Well, guess what, they are
generally true! Many scientists
have given up eating bacon. ham,
sausages, hot dogs, anything that
contains the chemical nitrate,
which has left many laboratory
animals deformed with cancers.
What about all you chocolate
lovers" Did you know that [he FDA
allows 150 insect irngmcnls per
are ounces oi chocolate; 10 fly
eggs per 3.5 fluid ounces oi canned
citrus fruit juice: and 8 rodent
hairs per 100 grams of apple
butter? Eggs and chicken usually

processed ioods still contain
Monosodium Glutamate (MSG);
bread and beer are often con-
laminated with aflatoxin (a
natural chemical produced by
certain molds), and also one oi the
most potent cancer causing agents
ever discovered. And the list goes
on'

Now many consumers reply that

FDA instituted monthly FDAs
consumer meetings in which
consumer representatives can
question FDA policy and keep
abreast on all pending petitions.
These meetings are just a small
entry into the previously forbidden

although it is an admission by the
FDA that they need a consumer
viewpoint as well as that of
