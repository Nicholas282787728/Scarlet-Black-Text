on the morning orSept. 26. two police ofﬁcers
instructed roommates iohn Bohman ‘06 and Juan Diaz
’06 to taite down a us, ﬂag that had heen hanging
upside.down outotrheir Younirer thirdstory window,
which is visible from the Street

The students had hung the flag to express discon-
tent with US. policy “I am anti—imperialist and :tnti»
capitalist," Diaz explained, “I don't agree with a lot of
the things that the us. has done."

Added Brahman. “The ﬂag stands for an ideal, for
rights and freedom. What we are saying in hanging it
upsidetdown is that what it stands for is being turned
upsidcedown, and instead orupholding [those ideals],
we have been going against
them."

The officers, Theresa
Petersen and David Kline, told
the studenrs that displaying the
tiag in such a manner is against
state and federal law, and that if
the ﬂag was nor tairen down,
they would be tairen to the sta.
tion and charged with a misdt’e
meanot, according to an account
by Diaz.

“lrwas hroughi to our atttnr
non that [the ring] was on the
huilding, and we knew or the
law," Petersen said, “So we
checked with the county attor»
ncy, and he said he was writing
to prosecute,"Tiit otricers dri
naily asked to he let into the Slut
dents room, but student Arrairs vice president Toni
Crady refused, He directed them to campus security,
which they contacted, and a security orricor brought
them to the students’ room. The three were there to
meet Disc and thman when they returned from class.
Kline described the students’ demeanor as “pleasant”
and said that once they understood what the law was,
“they were ﬁne with iralring the iiag down] "

Diaz and Bohmun had also hung a mullet United
States ilag upside-down outside their door. According
to Dine, when he went inside his room to take down
rhe tlag hanging out oirhcwindow, the otticers turned
this smaller ﬂag around, so that the union 7 ihar is,

"The flag stands for an
ideal, for rights and free—
dom. What we are saying
in hanging it upside-down '
is that what it stands for
is being turned upside-
down, and instead of
upholding [those ideals],
we have been going
against them."

The otheers conﬁrmed his story. “We turned it
around,” Kline said, without hesitation. "That's rhe
way it is supposed to he displayed.”

When Dfaz saw the ilag had been righted. hesime
ply took it down and tossed it inside the room to where
the larger tlag lay crumpled on his ﬂoor. “i didn't want
any trouble," he said. (incidcnrally. placing the ﬂag

The law

According to the iowa Civil
Liberties Union (lCLU), the
constitutionality of the ofﬁcers'
demand that the students take
the ﬂag down. ishighly questinne
able. Both the Iowa State Su-
prtme Court and the united
States Supreme Court have acted
to protect abuse oi’rhe {lag when
it becomes a form otpolirical ex-
pression,

in Texas v jr/rrnrm, a 1989
nag—burning case, the us, Su.
prenio court ruled that desecrat
tion or the nag as a form or
speech is protected under rhe First Amendment.

And l6 years earlier, in a case called State v Kan],
the Iowa Supreme Court found that a man in New-
ton with an upside-down ﬂag and a peace sign hang.
ing in his window could not be punished tor violate
ing a state law that was an earlier version oh and had
exactly the same wording as, rhc section or the law
that the Criltnell siiidents have been accused ofbteak»
in .

ESection 718A.l ofthc [owa Code states that any
person who shall “east contempt irpon, satiriac, de-
ride or hurlcsoiit [the iiagi. .shail heguiiiyorasimpie
misdemeanor." Violators can receive up to 30 days in

though the usual penalty is a ﬁne hetwecn iso and
$500.

“Tl-re towa Supreme Court had said that this srar.
ure cannot he used to prevent someone from hanging
a ﬂag upsidedown as a political expression." said Ben
stone, Director otthe ICLU, “The poiiec cirhcr were
not familiar with. or weren't aware of, or disregarded
this ruling."

“The student should have his record cleared and
rhere should he an apology," he said.

The federal law that applies to this case serves
mostly as a guideline and Violations carry no penalty
lr states that “the ting should never he displayed with
the union down, except as a signal ordire distress in
instances ofcxtreme danger to life or property," and
can be round underTirle 56,Chaptet10,5ecrion 176
or the us. Code. While protecting tiaghurning as
political expression in Term u/a/mwn, the Supreme
Court atrirmed Congress’s right to make “such rec.
ornniendarions."

The protection that fo/imun~und similar deci.
sionkorters to demonstrators hire Bohman and Diaz
only applies when the desecration or misuse or the
ting is indeed a term orpoiitical expression. in Spence
v win/irrigun (1974), a case in which a man was are

symhoi athxed to it outside his window, the us SuA
preme Court ruled in tavor otspence, “1r would have
been difﬁcult for the great maionry otcitrrens to miss
the dritt of [Spenc‘c's] point at the time that he made
it," they wrote, noting that his action roughly coin.
cided with the bombing oicnmhodia and the Kent
State shootings. The desecration was thercrore Free
tacted under the First Amendment.

Protected speech?

Asked whether he felt his and his roommate‘s ac-
tion was understood to be a political statement, thiz
replied, ”To the people at this school, I rhinit it is
obvious that it is a political expression It should be
mote obvious because ofthe time that we are in. Th ,
should ltnow what is going on and what [an upside
down ﬂag] means." .

"someone in Newton might

assurance or tranquility is

forget about tree speech.
Under such a requirement,
the only had speech would
