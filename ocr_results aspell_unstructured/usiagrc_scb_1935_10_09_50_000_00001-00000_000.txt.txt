Pioneers to Meet Carls

By Jim Brsdley

The Scarlet and Black will
carry an incomplete ivirc story
of the game Saturday afternoon
against Carleton. Henry Hirsch,
news editor, will Send the story
from the press box on Laird
field in Northfield, Minn. Final
scores may be obtained by coll-
ing Outside 241.

ton since 1931 When Hank Thomas
ran Wild and annihilated the Carls
almost single handed, and the
Pioneers, still stinging from last
year's heart breaking defeat hand-
ed them by the Minnesota outfit,
will journey to Northfield blood
thirsty for revenge.

Play Two Ties

Carleton has played in two
scoreless games against Gustavus
Adolphus and Ripon college. both
of whom, rumor has it, have the
strongest teams in years. The fact
that Gustavus Adolphus whipped
st. Mary's of Winona, a school
coached by Big Ed Krause of
Notre Dame, by the decisive mar—
gin of 27-0 brands the Gusties as
a powerhouse offensively: but as
strong as they are, they were un-
able to pierce the Carleton de-
tense for scores.

To offset this pessimism, the
Pioneers are making vast strides

yesterday by the faculty commit-
tee on student organizations and
publications. The action was tak-
so when it. was found that the

1936 Cyclone represented itself dis-
tinctly as being a successful busi-
ness venture, the publication be

administration to be used as they
see fit in connection with public
relations wor _,,
