Oi course, the Gl'illr

nell scrapping spirit must be given
partial credit tor the nanny Culmillr
atioii or these seasons, but there was
another eqnally potent iactor in bring
ing aborit the result. Griirnell teams
have always won on superior heads
work, largely due to good leadership.
The captains oi the Grillnell teams
in past year-s have been coaches as well
as captains, and it has been due to
their eiiorts largely, that Grinnell has
been able to do the work, and hold her
place in this sport

Captain Scott liacEachron, and the
captainelect, K. Carney, represent well
this type oi brainy lenders, remarkable
rather ior their iiead work, and Cools
ness in critical moments, than ior-
strength and brawn. MacEachi-on her

played on his class nve, school champ-

to be noticed when he, as captain oi
'09s squad, led them to victory. So
when Mollrath leit school, MaoEach-
ron was chosen to the position oi re»

ted the following year, winning the
distinction oi captaining two champs

Kreigh Carney, ’11, the Captainrelect,
has had two year-s varsity experience.
He was kept out at the beginning oi
last season by his physical condition,
yet when he was able to come out, the
team was strengthened immensely. His
sensational basket in the last minute
oi the Simpson game will not soon be
iorgotten, and to him must be given a
large part or the credit tor the
two victories over Iowa, Carney, too,
