BRIGADE DISGLUSEU

Harris Meredith Writes as Mem-
ber of Marine Brigade of
Second Division.

rrivnte Harris Meredith, ex-'Zl, now
‘a member of the Marine brigade of the

Second division, stationed in Germany,
has written a letter telling of the rec
ord of the Marine brigade in the war,
And declaring that it is as good 0 ' bet:
ter than that or the Rainbow div ion.
Ralph Patterson, Ralph Hoyt, Herbert
Tutue, and Lieut. Elbert Ross are
some or the other Gl-iuucll men who
saw service with this division. Mere-
dith writes:

“The casualties of the Second divis-
ion clearly show which division had
the hardest and most ﬁghting. We had
23,000, onertenth or the whole A. E. F.
Some 12,000 prisoners were Captured
by the Second, a majority of some 6,000
over any other division; more artillery
by 100 than any other. Advances of
(30 kilometers were made, which beats

‘ the Rainbow division by 5.

“We are not claiming that we won
the war, but we want the Fortyrsec—
and (Rainbow) to know that they are
not the only division in the A. E. F.
I think that the Fortyesncoud would
say that on June 30 was the ﬁrst
American battle for them, when the

‘ First, Second ’and Third American
regulars Went in ztt Chateau This
I don’t know the casualties of other
brigades, but of the Marine brigade
. of 8,000 men only 1,000 came out une
touched.”
