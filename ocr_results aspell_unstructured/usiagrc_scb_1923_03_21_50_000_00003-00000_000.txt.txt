“Mrs. Temple ’5 Telegram” Well
Received —- Talent in Fresh
Ranks Is Revealed.

Broad smiles and hilarious laughter
greeted the freshman fl‘olickel’s who
presented the farce, "Mrs. Temple‘s
Telegram.” in the A'. 11, IL, auditorium
ast Saturday night. Avolvedly and
decidedly light and racy, tho iarce

were solved by equally absurd solu-
tions which seemed to amuse both the
actors and the audience. In fact, the

nlel'liment.

The iorce was literally crammed
with humorous incidents and the cast
shorrld ho given the praise which they
dcssrvc in making the most oi every
opportunity to get a laugh out oi the
audience. George Johnston, playing
thi: ’part oi Jack Temple, had both the
ability and the opportunity as leading
man to prrt his part across in admir—
able fashion. If’lndlvldua‘l honors are
to be distributed he undoubtedly won
the blue ribbon, because of the way in
which he threw himselt so unreserv-
cdly into his role and exploited over-y
particle oi humor in his lines. James
VVOl'k, as Frank Mllei’, proved an able

‘supporting character for Johnston and
should come in for second honors, In
isct, the team Work oi these two men
[practically insured the success oi the

i Judged as a farce, “Mrs Temple's
