In the second half the Grinnell
men settled down to steady and
accurate shooting and pulled
away from the Wesleyan team.
White and Bob Williamson, guard,
seemed to be in rare form as they

team leading to the tune of 35-34
and with twentyrfive seconds re»
mining in the game, the time
clock stopped due to what is be—
lieved to have been a mechanical
failure. As this failure of the
clock was not noticed immediate-
ly, the game might have been
over with a victory for Grinnell.
As it was, the officials decided
to allow play to continue for fif-
teen seconds and then conclude
the game. During this brief
period a Norseman was fouled
and made his shot to tie the
score 3535. This sent the game
into an overtime period and dur-

Dr. Friedrich emphasized che
idea that we must take a more
mature view of inter-national
affairs than previous generations

have. The situation within the
United states resolves itself to a

controversy between internation-
alism and imperialism. Character-
istic attitudes of imperialism in-‘
clude a sense of superiority and
a naive sense of righteousness.

This is me opposite view

to the one Dr. Friedrich advo- ‘
cates. ' ‘
"Our mature attitude must

come from education by partisi
cipation," Dr. Friedrich stated}
This participation should come in
the form of an elective foreign'\
affairs council and an elective de—

legation to the UNO assembly;-
The American public should

assume the responsibility of these

elections and should make nation—

alism versus imperialism the ma—

jor political issue.
