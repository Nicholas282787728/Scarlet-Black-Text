conference championship

New administrator

BY CLA'IRE Rowen

After six seasons, coach
Antly Hamilton ’85 is stepping
down from his position as head
women's basketball coach to
frilly assume the role of ass.
tant athletic director. Currently,
Hamilton serves as a faculty
member, head women's bas-
ketball coach, head men's tens
nis and intCI'lm hcad Women's
tennis coach. Next year, he will
continue as head men’s, and bet
gin as women’s, tennis coach in
addition to his new administrate
tive positron.

"Moving out of basketball
was more tor administrative reasons than personal ones, said
Hamilton. “The shorter tennis seasons will allow me to function
better as assistant athletic director"

Having worked with both tennis teams this year, Hamilton
feels comfortable about his transition into his new coaching role.
This past fall, in his first season, the women's tennis team won
team and singlesedoubles titles in the Midwest Conference, en
route to Hamilton being named MWC Women's Tennis Coach
of the Yew:

The construction of Phase II of the new Athletic Center, set
to open in the fall of 2010, will expand the facilities for tennis,
opening new space and opportunities for both programs.

“The new fieldhouse will be more ‘tennisztiendly, said
Hamilton. “It will be a great facility, and we can recruit to that.“

The Athletic Department is currently in the process of
searching for a new head women’s basketball coach, who will ﬁll
that position as well as assist another sport. The makeup of the
position will allow the new coach to focus their eFEorts on bas-
ketball and allow the team to grow. As he leaves the program,
Hamilton wishes the team future success.

“Women’s basketball has a very nice foundation," said Ham-
ilton. “Things will only get better with new leadership and fan-
tastic facilities.”

What do the Yankees and Grinnell Swimming have in
common? They both have inter dominance ottheir respective
sports. Last weekend, the Pioneers tlaveled up to Appleton,W'I
to Compete in the MWC championship. Grinnell never looked
back, leaving the competition in the water with decisive victo-
ries in both the men's and women's conferences.
“It was the most enjoyable victory,” said coateam captain
Sean Warlick'08. “Everyone had to swim fast and improved."
Two students made the B-cut for nationals, meaning that

they will ﬁnd out it’ they will go on to nationals this weekend:

Cyrus Mistry ’11 won the zoo-breaststroke, setting a MWC
record of 2:08.16 and making a national B-cut. Garnet Smith
’08 also qualiﬁed for nationals with his title in the Bernetcr diw
ing event.

Then there was the commanding performance by the soot
yard freestyle relay team of Valerie stimat '09, Meghan Mes
Doniel '10, Jacqueline Anderson '11 and Morgan Horton ’1 1,
as they sets new conference record on their way to winning the
event in a time of 8.00.07.

This was one relay victory of many—the women won all
of them.

In addition, Grinnell women won five ofthe six top spots in
the ZOO-breaststroke, and took ﬁrst, second and third in the 50
free and the 100 free.

“There were a lot of smiles," said Women's CoeCaptain
Amanda Keledjian '08.

Amy Hadow '10 was one or those smiling, with her winning
1:00.52 time in the IOOemetet butterﬂy.

By the end of the meet, women had almost doubled their
opponents’ scote,eatning 1303 points,wrth Lawrence trailing in
second with only 766 points.The men's win was also dramatic,
tallying 1074 points, 194 ahead ofsecond-plaee Monmouth.

The victory was particularly impressive tor the men, given
that two of their strongest swimmers,Tommy Olson and Alex
Hotvath ’11, were both unable to compete. But even without

these strong players, the men won the 4oo-meter medley relay
as Glenn Clark ’10, Cyrus Mistry '11, Nate Wittnam ’09 and
Warlick ran an impressive time of 3:38.97, Warlick and Clark
ﬁlling in for Homth and Olson.

“We put together a much faster relay that i thought we
would, said Warlick Everyone really stepped up.

But Grinnell swimmers arejust plain good at stepping up .
This win marks the seventh consecutive MWC championship
for the men’s team and the tenth [or womens. But in addi~
tion to the team championships, Smith was named Diver of the
Meet for the second year in a tow, and McDaniel was named
swimmer otthe Meet with her zoosyard breaststroke victory.

This year's victories set a high bar for next year’s team. But
after so many years ofachieving number one, it’s hard to see the
swim team setting their goals any lower.
