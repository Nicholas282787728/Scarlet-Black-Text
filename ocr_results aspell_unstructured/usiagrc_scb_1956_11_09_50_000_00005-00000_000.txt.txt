The lead in the Midwest con»
ference changed hands once
again, as Knox climbed back
into top spot with a 33.7 win
over Grinncll, and Carleton, vrce
tim of a stunning 24.6 upset by
Ripon, dropped to second place.
Coe’s lopsided 40.7 triumph over
Monmouth kept the Kohawks in
a tie with Ripon for iourth.

Lawrence took undisputed
possession of sixth place with a
tierbreaking 20.0 shutout of Cor-
nell, now in seventh spot. Mon.
mouth and Crinnell, in that or.
der, bring up the rear. St. Olaf
remained in third,

The surprising Siwashers,
originally tabbed a likely celr
iar candidate, must now rate
as favorites for the title. Since
the only other teams with a
mathematical chance for un-
disputed top honors—Carleton,
St. Olaf and ltipon—have all
lost two games, Knox can
clinch the championship by
beating Lawrence and Ripon.
Knox will be favored to do
so, but both Wisconsin teams
are quite capable of upsets.
By winning their remaining

_ games, the Minnesota elevens
can tie Knox if the Slwashers
lose once or pass Knox in the
standings if the siwashers lose
twice.

Ripon‘s admittedly slim
chances depend on the Redmen’s
beating Cornell and Knox. while
Knox, Carleton and St. Olaf are
losing ALL their remaining con~
tests. with a 3-2-1 record, the
Redmen can figure in a title tie

tie games. To complete the list
of possibilities, Cost and Law-
rence could also figure in a title
tie if no team finishes with bet.

6th Varsity Loss;
Siwash Win, 3-1

By Walt Jawbson

Here we go againll 7 to 7 at
the half, and it was Knox who
emerged victorious 33 to 7; this
time before a gathering of Air
umni and guests.

Depth is one of the secrets
of success, Knox had it, and
the pioneers didn’t. Or, if they
did, they didn't use it.

As was the case at Cornell
last week and here two weeks
ago against Carlton, and at Ri-
pon before that and against
Lawrence and Coe, Bob Peter-
son’s determined group of 3th
letes played fine ball for two per.
iods. Then, fatigued and hat-
tered, they completely collapsed.

The Pioneers have proved
time and again that they’re

iron will be the scene of a bat
tie between the two bottom
ranking iootball teams in the
Midwest conference — Grinnell,
and Monmouth, Saturday.

In many respects Grinnell’s
visitors and the host Scots are
on equal terms. Both teams
have had poor seasons with
Monmouth besting only Cornell,
14-13. and managing a tie with
Ripon. The Pioneers are as yel
winless, dropping six straight
verdicts to conference foes.

The injury riddled Grinnell
squad will be without the ser-
vices ol Sam Petroff, and
Gary Pattschull is only a
doubtful participant in tomor-
row’s fray. This means that
the top two fullback aspirants
are sidelined, which Coach
Peterson has attempted to off-
set by switching starting end,
Larry nukes to a fullback
slot.

Jack Shaffer, junior haLfback
is reportedly ready for action.
although he has seen only limits
ed action in practice the past
week. Charley Adams, junior
guard, injured in last week’s
Knox contest, also appears ready
for unlimited competition in the
Monmouth contest.

The Pioneers have brushed
up on their running game in
this week‘s practice sessions,

Monmouth’s hopes for a
homecoming victory have been
brightened by the return of
backfield star Fischer, who has
been sidelined for the past
three weeks.

The Scots offense is centered
around an unorthodox scrim-
mage formation, featuring the
short punt, and balanced single
wing. The home team is pri-
marily a running team. similar
to the Pioneers, the Scots will
field a big team composed main»

For the Grinnell gridders. it

Thinclads Win;
Defea’r Knox
In Dual Meel

A sweeping 16—4 victory over
invading Knox college during
Homecoming weekend brought
the Pioneers’ crosscountry squad
to a 5-1 conference record with
one dual meet left against Mon-
mouth before the Midwest con-
ference meet in Chicago, Nov.
17.

Taking the first four places,
Chuck Yank, Larry Schaleger,
John Welden and Noel nac-
chus forced the Knox runners
into lower positions, while Bob
Downs in sixth position com.
pleted the first five runners
finishing for Grinnell.

The important aspect of last
weeknd’s victory, however, lies
in the fact that for the first
time this season, two squad
members have run the course
under 16 minutes, while two
others came'close to doing this
also. In general the squad’s
times have been consistently
better for corresponding meets
than those of last year's squad.

The freshman cross-country
squad ran an exhibition twee
mile course during the varsity
meet and the times returned
were surprisingly good consider—
ing the short period of training
it has undergone.
