LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Chalk Attracted Attention, Negative Response

To the editor,

Thisletrcr addresses the recent
outbreak of antirwar blanking that
appeared on campus as we rctumed
from Thanksgiving break. I take
issue with both the medium
employed and the message
expressed.

Does the fact the “chalkers”
write pithy slogans make them
any more peace-loving than]? The
fact that I did not decorate the
campus with anti-war epigrams
does not make me pro-war, pror
aggression or pro-imperialism. Yet
my reaction to the chalking was
negative.

As was added onto the sign

Committee

on the post office door on Nov.
26, “Suppon is needed to get
results. and vandalism breeds
contempt" Communication has
been hindered by the inﬂammatory
messages.

In front of the Forum I read,
“Collegesiudentsshould care.,.Act
now." This wrongly insinuates
that Ido noteare, and itangcrs me.
Who are they to question the depth
of my concern? As for the
admonishment “Act now.“ the
protesters fail to mention any
concrete options, Shall ijoin their
merry little band and continue to
adorn our sidewalks and buildings
with such creative questions as
“Ii-aqibloodinyourgasrank7"Shall

Imakca pilgrimage to Washington
to scrawl on the Capitol steps?
Respect for property would lend
credibility to the protesters‘
movement.

What have the chalkcrs gained
by their actions? More effective
protestsmighthaveincluded writing
letters to representatives and
senators in Congress or to the
White House. Granted, these
methods are more traditional, but
the confrontational racrics clouded
rather than clariﬁed the extreme
importance of the issues.

The repetition oftheslogan“No
blood for oil“ leads me to believe
that either the protesters were
uninformed about or ignored one

of the crucial issues intheconﬂict.
Only one naive would conclude
that the entire conﬂict stems from
the Western thirst for oil. The
demand for oil, I admit, plays an
important role in U.S. policy;
however, it is not the only issue.
Crucial is the question of
aggression.

In the post»ColdWar world. it is
imperative that the United Nations
uphold this precedentithat naked
aggression which threatens
international order is unacceptable.
One may argue that America is
hypocritical in criticizing Iraq in
light of our invasion of Grenada
and Panama.

However. if one examines the

Reacts to Concert Editorial

No Decision on Proposed Fees Until Students Respond

To the editor.

We would like to take this
time to respond to those on the
Scarlet and Black staff who
spokeoutagainstthe“misguided
and unfair policy of charging
admission to concerts.”

First of all; we want to stress

that this “policy“ is not apolicy. it
is simply an idea at this point. The
Harris center, which will be
completed next semester, will have
a large, new concert venue which
will no doubt help draw acts that
would otherwise not even consider
Grinnellatrlll. Unfortunately.these
larger acts will require that the

[Concerts] Committee spend a
disproportionate amount of its
budget on one show, thus reducing
the amount thatcztn be spent on the
rest of the semester.

Willi this distasteful idcainmind,
the Concerts Committee raised the
possibility thataminimal admission
be charged for at most one or two

Student Argues Against Proposed
Fees for "Big Name" Concerts

To the editor,

I am writing [about] the
Concerts Committee's proposal
to charge admission to “Big
Name" concerts. Such a policy
would be discriminatory to
studentswhocouldnotafforda
ticket. In addition, ticket
revenues would supplement. not
cover, the cost ofa concert The
rest of the cost would be covered

by Concerts Committee money,
which is student money.

A studentwho couldn't afford a
ticket would still be forced to
subsidize the cost ofthe concert for
Ihosewho could affordtjckcts. They
wouldhavetohelppay foraconcert
they couldn't attend. A Concerts
Committee member told me that
reaction had generally been
favorable because “who wouldn't
be willing to pay five bucks to see

concerts, iflhis would help foot
the extra money needed. This
idea was only pursued after it
appeared that neither Student
Affairs nor SGA would be able
to augment Concerts’ next
semester budget.
Withallthisinmind,though.
this idea will go no further than
the planning stage if the student
body is opposed to it. The
concerts program is for the
student body. Thus, the fate of
the proposal to charge...fot
having one or two larger shows
lies with the student body, not
with the Concerts Committee.

the US, did not threaten world
security in these military actions;
whereas, a shift in the balance of
power does threaten both U.S.
interests and world order in such
a strategically importantarea as the
Middle East.

As this is a world problem, I
feel itvery imponanl that America
demand from ourallics increased
suppon in order that the conﬂict
doesnotdevelopintoan“American
policeman Vs. Arab nation”
scenario. Furthermore. I. like the
protestors. see the importance of
allowing the embargo to take its
effect, rather than engaging in a
bloody.costly,devasmtingshooting
war.

As a method of increasing
awareness. the chalkers efforts
certainly succeeded; they brought
home (literally) the apprehension
that accompanies the approaching
threat of war in our generation.

Hamlet Production Too Slow Despite Strong Performances

To the editor.

Afterreading the rave review of
Hamlet given by Emily Nehus and
Ryan McNaughton, I felt bound to
sceitformyself, According totheir
review. as a fan of Shakespearean
tragedy I should have loved this
play. Unfortunately that would be
overstated.

Ididenjoystrong performances
by several characters. Heather
May‘s moving and disturbing
portrayal of Ophelia contrasted
beautifully with a stoic Horatio as
played by Tom Berger.

Corrie Zoll's periormanee of
Hamlet seemed to take awhile
to gain momentum. Fortunately

Dan Sharp was able to drive
the play foreward through the
first. act and a half. He played
Polonius with brilliant energy and
a sense of humor that was a
pleasure to watch. However. when
2011 got going midway through
the second act. ht: became the
dominating force on stage. He
performed what is arguably the
most challenging role in Western
theater with speed. precision,
great feeling and a marvelous
lcyity.
Whilelherewerecharactcrswho
were thoroughly pleasing to
watch, llie play itself was
unnecessarily slow. I was hoping
that 2011': energy would drive

the play, but Larry Finder's
Claudius refused to be driven.
Although this was an artistically
effective contrast, it was also
exuemcly slow and tedious.

I was hoping Hamlet's
instructions to his players in Act 3,
Scenc’7' “speak the Spwch.lpray
you. . .tnppingly on the tongue"
would motivate Finder to deliver
his lines with some speed.
Unfonunalcly he mouthed more,

when the melodrama would end.
