Why do you think health
eoreogain has become on the
forefront of public interest?

1 think . it's expensive.
Health care is likcalot of other
things. People think rhere are
a lot of problems iii the sys—
tem, even if they are relatively
satisﬁed with the services
they receive, they are being hit
wirh higher cost themselves
and even though they bear
only a small proportion of the
total cost, it’s unpleasant and

that makes
lﬁBB

the issue
..

important.
And then,
to a signiﬁ—

cant degree,

the elites who

study this issue

are telling them

it’s a problem.

And that's

resonated with candidates
and that’s appeared in various
statements.

What do you think the
main problems are with the
health care system?

There are different prob-
lems for different people. If
you’re well insured, rhe real
issue is the quality of care and
the costs you hate. if you’re
uninsured it’s becoming in-
sured. Ifyou're a provider, its
financial incentives and the
research backup to deliver
high quality care, and so on, It
depends on where you stand
in the health processes, what
the central issue is for you.

Mental Health

November

 

from p. 1

One of the therapists who counseled students for ninc years
at the Poivcshick County Mental Health Center is Harriett
Dickey-Chasins '82, a psychologist who also helped srudents
with mental health issues when she scrvcd as an SA. during her
srudontyears. Whilc DickeerIrasrns now professionally rrcats
many of the same mood and pcrsonaliry disorders she saw on
campus as a student, one change she has seen over the years is
an increase in treatment of eating disorders, which she partly
attributes to better recognition of the condition.“Wejust didn‘t
know what it was back Ihcn,"shc said.

“Because Giinnell is such a small and personal place, were
more aware of when someone is suffering,” said Dickeerliar
sins.

Placing srudenrs on mandatory leave~oflicially referred
to as “interm leave”——is a very delicate process and is always
handled on a case-by-case basis, with only Crady, President
Osgood and the dean ofihc Faculty involvedThc protocol for
these mandatory leaves, however. is very ambiguous. “What it
says in the [student] handbook is that anyone who is at risk
to themselves and a risk to other people may be placed on an
interm lcavc,"said Crady.

In deciding wherhcr to place .\ studenr on volunrary or in
voluntary medical leave, therapists and student affairs decide

whether they believe the student is m imminent risk ofhurtlng
themselves or others. DickcysChlislns, who has helped place
students on voluntary medical leave, said in her experience the
school looks for other options ﬁrst like extensions on assigns
moms and dropping classes. But occasionally. rht staffbclieves
a student’s ability to function will be in great danger if the stir
dent is badly ill and they continue to grind themselves down
with Grinnell's workload and should go home for treatment.

“Generally," Crady explained, “that's pending a college hear
ing." in most cases, a student will be decide to go on voluntary
medical leave and the case will not be brought up to the level of
a heuIing. “Do these cases [ormandatoryleave] come up a lot?"
asked Cindy. “They don’t, they really don't."

Once therapists think a student should be placed on medical
lcavc, a small hearing is held with a psychiatrist and administra—
tors from Student Affairs. Usually, the student then decides to
take a voluntary medical leave.

Dickey-Chasins also noted that it is especially tricky to den
termine the best choice of action in cases of eating disorders,
since the victims are often highly intelligent and organized so
rhcir schoolwork doesn’t surfer even as they fall apart inside. “I
don’t blame people for feeling angry sometimes,"shc said.

“we all have a great respect for smdenrs' rights," explained
DickcysChasins. “We have rouse our clinical judgment s is this
person competent or are they so sick they don’t know what’s a
good choice for them? It's a ﬁne balance."

“They were rhe sort orsurrogare grandparcnrs of all rhe sure
dents that went through classics,” said Joe Cummins.

For the Cummins’ and their family, the McKibbens’watmth
hclpcd rhcm adjust ro life in Grinncll. “Tlicy rook an acrive
interest in us as members of the department," said Monessa
Cummins.

Monessa Cummins recalled one Christmas Eve when the
McKibbens invited her family over to watch them light the
candles on a traditional Christmas tree. “Bill climbed up on a
short ladder and started lighting all the candles, and our kids
were thrilled," she said. “And I think Bill was just as thrilled at
watching their reaction"

This generosity was extended to studenrs as well. “My first
contact with him as a student was in high school when l was
just learning Greek," said Cleaver, a Grinnell native. “He was
going to be teaching the Orlyruy in rhe fall and he asked,
‘Would you like to read it with ch'It was very difﬁcult for meY
but I probably learned as much in those eight weeks asl ever
did from any other course that I took."

Cleaver added that the McKibhens took a special interest in
their srudents, a sentiment echoed by members of thc departs
merit. “They made many lasting attachments to students," said
Phillips. “For them, it was all about the students really.”

Even outside of the College itself, the couple worked to in-

elude students. “They were very acrive at St. Paul’s Episcopal
Church,” said Cleaver. "One of the things rhcy always wanred
to do was make sure that students felt at home there."

And while rhey clearly had an impact on generations of
students and faculty throughout the campus, the legacy of the
McKlbbens will be felt greatest in the Classics department.
“They kept classics alive here and revived ii, and built a departs
mcnr after they came in 1952," said Phillips,‘

The Classics department will remember the McKibbens
not only through their deeds, but through the McKibben Lec-
ture Series, established in their name.

“They promorcd, nor overtly by words but by their actions.
an ethos ofgenerosity, acceptance, and humility," added Mons
essa Cummins. “Members of the classic department have under
their guidance, and since, maintained a tradition of generosity
towatd one another, towards their students, and of the kind of
humility thar gocs wirh a deep appreciation for their discipline.
And that continues."

The McKibbens even went so far as to donate their house
to the College, the only stipulation being that they could pick
roses there when they wished.

The McKibbens will be honored at an upcoming memorial
arranged by Gerald Lalonde, Classics, a close friend of the fams
ily and longtime colleague ofboth Betty and Bill.
