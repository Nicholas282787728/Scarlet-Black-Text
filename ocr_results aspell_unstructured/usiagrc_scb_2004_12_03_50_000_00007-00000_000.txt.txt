In Exquisite corpse, a game from the early 20th
century, players create a picture by continuing the
drawing of the person before, not knowing what the
previous person has created. By collaborative effort
they create something they would not have brought
into existence on their own.

ProfessorTodd Coleman,Music, has done some-
thing quite similar to Exquisite Corpse with his new
piece by the same name, which he will premiere on
Dec. 11 at 7:30 p.m. in Roberts Theaterr “The Ex—
quisite corpse” recital will feature guest cello soloist
Florcnt Renard-Payen on “Exquisite Corpse" and
several other Coleman compositions.

The feature piece is a multimedia presentation, a
blend of music and abstract video. “The whole idea
is to be thought provoking," said Coleman. “Hope~
fully people will understand my thoughts, and more
importantly have their own.” The piece was based
on a photograph made in the Exquisite Corpse style
that made him think of“life, death, and mortality"

The “Exquisite Corpse" composition is the fur
sion of two separate commissions, a piano solo and
a cello solo, both with electronic accompaniment.
Coleman himselfshot the video portions along with
Grinnell's own William Pergl, Art. Neither knew
exactly what the other would shoot about the topic
of the piece.

Even Coleman’s score (the written music) was
not written normally: instead of dividing the mus
sic conventionally, Coleman placed counters over
the music to mark how many seconds should have
passed. This leaves the flow of the music up to the
soloist and creates a ﬂuid effect. Ilan Moscovitz ‘07,
said, “it really feels timeless."

Coleman said he wanted to experiment with to»
tal art in “Exquisite Corpse."While he did not gene
erated all the material, he decided the order and way
in which everything is presented.

“That may be sort of a power trip,” admitted
Coleman, but concluded that “The most-important
thing in music is not it being well-crafted; you must
intuse some otyoui-selrin the music."

On Sunday at 2 pm, when the symphonic band
performs its last concert of the semester, one mu—
sician will be absent. Thomas Alexander ‘05, who
died in a car accident on Saturday night, was a band
memberThe band dedicates this concert to him.
Thomas Alexander played saxaphone for the
band every semester he spent at Grinnell. “It is really
hard rehearsing and preparing for the concert with

out him because he was such an important aspect of _

band," said Angela Schacht, a fellow saxophone who
sat next to Thomas every semester. “We miss him."

prominent in its gong and percussion-

According ro Devin Lindsey

‘05, who has shared a section with Alexander since
their ﬁrst year, he was a close friend of many people
in the band, including the director. Linsdsey said
Alexander was “an integral part or our ensemble"
and that she respected Alexander’s skill as a music
eian. “He was an excellent member whose good hu-
mor showed not only through his permanent smile,
but also through his playing.”

The night before the GrTones’second concert
or this year, they sang for a gathering of Grinnell
alums. After a repertoire that included a number
of serious hymns, the event’s host extended an in—
vitation to attend the second concert. A number
of “little old ladies,"in the words of member Co-
lin Reynolds ’07, ended up sitting in the Forum’s
North Lounge the next day to hear songs such as
“Enormous Penis" and “Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles” sung by a bunch of college guys dressed
in Halloween costumes.

For their third, and largest, concert on Dec.
11, that sort of irreverence will he in shorter sup—
ply. Despite songs such as the sea shanty “What
Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor?" the bulk
ofthe G-Tones’ program will be much more seri-
ous. One highlight is the hymn “Salvation is Cre-
ated,"tirst performed by the GrTones several years
ago. Other songs that they are especially proud of
include the 605 song “Happy Together" and “So
zlerimi Geri Alamam" (“I Can’t Take My Words
Back"), a traditional Turkish song arranged by na—
tive Cypriot Emre Oztek’07.

“We're trying to create a completely different
emotion in our listeners," Reynolds said. “It won’t
be the usual G—Tones experience, but we think it’ll
be just as enjoyable.”The Dec. 11 concert will be
at 4 p.mr in Sehting-Lewis.

Student Recitals

Next Friday, Dec. 10 is the last of the mu»
sic 220 student recitals for the semester. At 4:15
pm. in the Sebring-Lewis Hall,15 students will
be performing 13 pieces ranging from about ﬁve
to seven minutes, and selected by the students
with their teachers as a recital for their music 220
lessons.

According to Patrice Ewoldt, coordinator
for the recital and accompanist, this year’s recital
will be longer than usual but also very impres-
sive, featuring works by Beethoven, Chopin,
Schumann, a Mozart clarinet trio and even an
original piece on the jazz piano. The performers
are: Rebecca Blanchard, Brian Ewing, Karen Gar
dos, Alex Leach, Renee Lindeman, Liz Mallott,
Wini Marcel, Emma Meade, Michaela Meckel,
Emrc Oztek, Anne Packard, Jacqueline Puretz,
Brent Shadel and Bryan Williams. They will
be accompanied by Ewoldt, as well as students
Lindsey Martin and Allie Kieffer. The recital will
feature piano, jazz piano, violin, trombone and a
mezzo soprano.

Ewoldt said that this, as well as the earlier
recitals, serves as a way for the students in less
sons to learn concert etiquette and how to act
and perform on stage. She also said,“We use See
bring-Lewis Hall to train how to perform in a
less scary setting. Walking out on that stage can
be an ovenvhelining experience.”
