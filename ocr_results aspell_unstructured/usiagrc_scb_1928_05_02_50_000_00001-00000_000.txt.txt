Moral Attitude of Youth More Sound
Than That of Middle Age Says Pastor

lly Miami )lilliguu.

“Tile moral attitude of youth is
more sound than the mural/attitude
o[ middle-age,” Dr. Miles I-i, Krunl-
blue of Parkside Lutheran church,
N. Y., told a SCARLET AND BLACK
reporter yesterday.

“in nly experience as a pastor," he
continued,” i have found youth more
eager than his elders to achieve ex-
cellence. The illidtllerftged man is
more apt to commit excesses than the
youth.

The reason for that," he explained.
”is often, that the midille-nged man
has acquired the money to carry on a
program of excesses that he could not
afﬂprd earlier in life, Having gained
in financial standing, he indulges in
vices which he escaped in youth.

Mr Krunlbinc pointed out the fact
that different standards of judging
vice are used by different classes of
people. "Youth condemns the modern
world for greed aild acquisitireness,"
hc said, ”Jiidtllceage comlemns the
sins of the flesh. You will find in
the gospel of Mark that Jesus Christ
places adultery/and. avarice side by
side. and yet most people refuse to
recognize it as a sin."/

ll lillNliSDAY, MAY 2, 1925

To illustrate the difference in attie
tude of youth and middle ago, Mr.
Krumhinc d ribed his recent exper-
ience of visiting Wells college for
women. Ho said: “Aftcr preaching
at Wells college one Sunday evening.
I was entertained with a group of
faculty members at tea in the dean‘s
suite, One of the college girls canoc
to me and asked me to talk for a
while with a group of the girls.

“As we went down the corridor I
smelled smoke and inquired about it.
’Yes,’ the girl replied, ’I’m taking you
to the smoking room, I hope you won’t
mind.’

"Well, I told her I didn't mind if I
could smoke, too, And I did smoke.
Now if some middle-aged people had
looked in the windows of that room
and hail seen the fifty girls lounging
about, and smoking, they would have
condemned the girls most severely.

“But those girls were concerned
mainly with learning how to cope with
the vulgar world outside, when they
should go out into it and make cone
tacts with the acquisitivc middle-aged.
And they asked thc most potent, vital
questions concerning life problcn
and carried on the most sincere d‘
cussion Unit I have heard any where."

EMANEIFMIUN i5
KEY il SUBBESS
AVEHB KHUMBINE

“Passion For Excellence” Is Text
of Rev. Miles H, Krumbine‘s
Chapel Talk Tuesday.

NEDIOCRITY SOUGHT FOR

Speaker Declares Emancipation Is
Proving Disastl-ons To Our
Religion And Morals.

Lord Harvey‘s advice on cultivating
a "passion for excellence" was the
theme of the chapel address on Tues~
day morning by Dr. Miles K. Krumhine
of the Parkside Lutheran church of
Buffalo, New York,

Dr. Krumhiue told the story of Lord
Harvey‘s being asked by a group of
young men to sunl up his pholosophy
of life in one sentence. The great Eng-
lishmau replied, ”My young friends,
cultivate a passion for excellmce."

”One word," said Dr. Krumhine,"
tells the story of American progressi
emancipation, The Pilgrims coming
to a new country irecd themselves
from an established religion and a
new climate. Later, the people of the
new land freed themselves from
George the Third, Now that we are
free we are all too prone to turn up-
on the traditions and institutions that
gave us our emancipation."

Emancipation Is Dangerous

Developing ills subject further by
anecdotes and telling illustrations, the
speaker declared that we are as good
or as had as we can afford to he. Em—
ancipation is proving disastrous to lies
ligion and morhls.

Dr. Krumbine deplored the facile
use of the wor s "sclfeexpression" to
excuse a multitude of faults "Too
often,” , id the speaker, “the remark
is made that to restrain olie’s selﬁsh
impulses is to lay oneself open to a
complex. Has it not occurred to any-
one that to restrain impulses for good
and impulses for heroism is also to
lay oneself opcn to a complex?”

Mediocrity Sought

The lecturer averred that a desire
not to he abovc the average was be-
coming noticeablc in modern student
life. Dr Krumhille mentioned Lord
B gce's criticism alter visitng the.
United states, Tile Englishman re-
marked that the faiaiism of the multi—
tude was uppermost. The idea that
movements may he studied but not
turned was dominating the public
mind.

As a final point in his speech, Dr.
Krumhine declared that great things
are usually done by second-rale'peo-
pie. But he said that a distinctly sec—
ondrl-ate person, by devoting himself
to a firstrratc cause. may be able to
shake off the fatnlism oi the multie

,tutle.

“One lifc counts," concluded Dr.
Ici-umbin‘e," and it doesn't have to be a
great am. not I can attach myself to
ideals. I can yield myself to prophetic
personalities. I greet with you the
prospect of achieving excellence."
