and second in the broad jump with a
leap or 24 lect 2 3-3 inches, to score
eleven points, one more than the
number made by Hubbard ol Michi-
gan.

The Grinnell total for the

Rinelurt placed ﬁfth in both the
shot and discus throw. If team
scores had been countd Grinnell
would have ranked tom-th with Le»
land stnnlord iirst, Michigan second,
and Ohio third.

At the San Francisco meet Taylor,
running his first race tor the Illinois
