CAMPUS DEPOSITDRS

Sixteen campus organizations are affected by
the proposed re-openillg plan of the Grillllcll Stale
bank. This reopening, if depositors agree to it,
will involve the ilnlllediate payment of 25 per cent
of deposits in cash, tlle waiver of 25 per cent for a
period not to exceed three years, and tile disposi»
tion of tlle remaining 50 per cent ill a trust fund,
managed and controlled by the directors of the
bank, future directors, or by persons specified by
the state banking department.

If the plan were not followed, and forced
liquidation of the bank was effected at present. it
would lnean immediate collection of all DtltsttllKi
illg notes whicll would necessarily mean hardship
alld perhaps disaster to many persons. The liqui—
dation of tile securities which the bank is holding
at present depressed values, and the collectioil of
whatever alnouut can be obtained by all asse.
own: against the stockholders, would cause the e.
pellse of such a liquidation to be borne by the de—
positors. Receiverships, in turn, are expensive,
and the depositor and stockholders hear such ex-
pense. Under the proposed plan, the expense of
liquidation is borlle by a “going” concern.

The suggested waiver will enable campus or-
ganizations to obtain one-fourth of their deposits
at once, and will insure them that the remaining
75 per cent will be available ill the future.

DINNER GUESTS

All Grinnell students are accustomed to see-
ing the head waiter, or waitress. come bearing
down on a particular table with a card to be
signed by the host or hostess, for some week-end
guest. It is the only method by which the college
seems able to keep its books straight on the mat-
ter of extra meals. These are, of course, checked
from room deposits

Certainly most of the college students leave
town at solne time for a few days at home or in
some nearby city. On such occasions we do not
find that the head waiters are ever on hand to
check on the number of meals that the student
eats outside of the college dining rooms, and we
Could not expect them to. This would be too

great a task.
/

We do not advocate a cash refund on such
nlca but we do believe that solllo method of
equalizing the guest tickets and the ollbof-lowll
llloills could be arranged. Wouldn’t it be possible
to haw ll student report to the house lnor
they or house president on those meals
missed by being out of tou'll‘.’ rt l'CﬂOI'Kl
could he ltcpt [or each student, ill this
way, and a rcscrle credit would thus be built up
from whit-ll guest meills would be subtracted. At
the end ol‘ the year any extra meals on credit of

student could be dropped and any on the other
side could then he charged to his room deposit.
lt rczllly scents unfair to the student to be
charged For every guest lllCtil when he l'r‘ccil'cx
absolutely no tZOlllllCll'11i0n for meals that he has
paid for and not eaten. We believe that some
such s telll could ea, ly be wol-kcd out for next
year at least, and would be a fair solution for this
problem.

COLLEGE ANNOUNCEMENTS

“'0, hour many complaints about the inef f--
ient wily ill which anumlllcelllollts are delivered
to the students of Gl'llilli‘ll college. and \ 0 must
admit that there is just ground for surh orii ism.

\Vaitcrs and men working ill the kitchen often
fail to hear smile important llotitc, and sometimes

out on something in which they are especial-
ly interested. Town men probably miss even a
larger share of activities, because they are further
rollloved from the dining room. ,\l.o. because of
the tem of serving the noon lunch in the dormi-
tories, other students do not always hear all ans
noilllccments,

We do not mean to pllt the blame on the head
waiters. because they do their part ill reading the
notices, in spite of the poor cooperation some-
times given them by the busy diners. Hon'c\ r,
something should be dolle to bring about a better
system of getting announcements across to all
the student body.

it seems that the bulletin boards at the quad-
rangle and the dormitories do not always contain
all notices, and are not always read by the town
students All official notice board ill between the
library and the Alumni Recitation hall should
reach all students, alld if used ill connection with
dining room announcements would elilllillatc the
complaints.

HARMLESS PROFESSORS
(Daily Northwestcnl)

Professors are all right in the university, business
thinks. In the classroom before the rostrum, the little
meek-eyed, forgetful Ph. D. is innocuous. When he
speaks of ionization, amoebae. Cartesian philosophy, or
marginal utility, the professor wins approval from the
money makers.

But when the professor becomes audacious enough
to involve himself in politics he is marked immediately
as dangerous. If he speaks in sociological terms about
improving conditions he is branded as a red. The
harmless little fellow who lectured at women‘s clubs
and luneheons suddenly grows to terrible stature. His
eyes glare with an awful light.

Business leaders, shuddering at the sight of college
professors on the president's cabinet. revealed their in-
stinetive fear of the academic mind. Editorials were
written ridiculing the mathematical Ezekial Mordecai
who can predict the price of hogs by using calculus.

What makes the professor dangerous when he leaps
ovcr the academic fence? Why does his mumbling
raise no concern when it is done in a classroom? Be-
cause professors have ideas; they are thinkers. And
thinkers when given political power naturally try to
transform these ideas into reality.

But American business is afraid of these academic
ideas. It prefers that the political power be vested in
non-thinkers, It feels perfectly safe when congress and
not President Roosevelt’s academic ”Brain Trust" di-
roots the affairs of our government.

Tile series of spring house parties
