Student group achieves rare nonproﬁt status

"As students at Grinnell, we all attempt to advocate social
justice. Thus, we a plaud the work that the Social Entrepre-
neurs of Grinnell ( EG) has accomplished since its creation in
April «2007. As a college group on cam-
pus that focuses on collecting mon-
ey for making micro-ﬁnance loans,

SEC has given power to individuals -
so that they may address inequality
in terms of social and economic po-
sitions in society. .
‘ SEG pravidcs micro-ﬁnancing
to entrepreneurs in Thirdonrld
countries that cannot obtain enough credit ,
for alcan. Micro-ﬁnance is away to assist sustainable devel-
opment. The men of these loans use the money avmrded to
them to expand rheir‘businosscs, investin better technologies
for their arms or improve their houses.
Recently, SEG received federal non—proﬁt status and as a

result has gained stat-us as a Non—Goverrunental Organ‘ggaﬁﬂg‘ '

This is an incredible accomplishment, considering the fact t at
SEG came ﬁom such humble beginnings—a student’s Wells

The Dream:

SEE gains status asNo‘n-Governmental Organization

Fargo bank account. SEG grew in numbers, in terms of both
student involvement and money, and in two short years gained
status as an international NGO. Not only is SEG one of the
first college groups in the nation to create a fund to make mi-
cro-ﬁnanceloans,but it is 'also one of the ﬁrst to receive status
as a nonproﬁt organization. The fact that
such a group within asmall institu—
tion and with such limited resources

has achieved this status is stunning.
Though we may be having dire
ﬁculty on campus initiating a trim—
quil community, it is nice to know
that other organizations outside of
the Grinneli bubble continue to prOr
mote peace by creating partnerships with
community-based entrepreneurial organizations and making
differences in in Third World countries. Giving the underpriv-
ileged opportunities to build a better life tor themselves and

their families is alvmys a plus in our eyes.

Student Affairs can always use more transparency
Last week, Student Aliens and Elena chal, Vice Presi-

dent tor Diversity and Achievement, releascd a Hate Crime

Response Policy—a year and a half aftcr'the a hate crime on

campus occurred, spurring an institutionalized policy.

While we are excited that progress is being made towards
deﬁning and responding to hate crimes, rhc lengthy wait af-
ter the inciting event and the miscommunicaiion from the
administration regarding the document is frustrating While it
remains unclear why prompt action was not taken directly fol-
lowing the events of spring 2008, it is certainly disappointing
that Grinnell students have had to wait so long for a policy to
be implemented.

On top of this, insufﬁcient information regarding the state
of the document, and the means by which Grinnell College
students could respond to the document, further aggravated an
already incensed community

Given the administration amended their previous rive-day
deadline, we are pleased that students are belng offered an op-
portunity to consistently look at the policy and make changes as
necessary but nonetheless this rniscommunication could have
been avoided.

We hope in the future that the administration will make
their policyemaking procedure more transparent and accessible
to the Grinnell College community.

fall semester in the state of Iowa

Do you feel that? yeah, it just got kind ofchilly
ousidc, didn‘t it? The leaves are really starting to
crunch under your feet and the sound ofdie wind
has mken on that not-tomfricndlyshutsallstoo-
familiar howl as it blows up against whatever
massive neolcommunist library or Gaudi SLLITET
alist campus center you’re hiding in for warmth.
Whether it’s from within the creaky wood frame
of your pizza crust and potato chip crumb covered
apartment or the tepid moist air of your poster
décor campus dorm
room, there is no
denying the physical
reali and statisti-
cal inevitability that
mmer is gone. God
damn it.

Okay now, let’s
just chill for a second. its not like everything has
gone bananas, right? You probably survived the
ﬁrst big test or paper of that Math or Foreign
Language dds your advisor advised you to "get
out of the my" during your ﬁrst semester. Check
one. Or you 12th semester seniors might still
be sanding with both your hood on as you stare
down the syllabus at the sense ofscminar paper
and presentauon deadlines. yeah man, that's the
ticket. Check two. And all those kiddies with oth»
er stuffon their plates~major declaration, study
abroad applications, Fulbl'lghls, Watsons, etc.—
thcrc's hope for you yet tooThis does not mean
I’mma drop some “when the going gets tough,
kind of deal from the 1994 Sean Austin elastic,
Rudy. No,l won't, even though (hill movie and its
autumnal iconography arc suarght dope. Whar
I’m getting at is a simple yet normative proposal
that we all take a deep breath, grab a hoodie and
start appreciating the sensory, emotional and in—
tellectual changes that our semester is dererrnie
natcly going to bring us.

Check it. Fall in Grinnell is beautiful. Try
listening when the cross bend to Lhe will of the
wind or when lear piles get rearranged moment
by moment by a seemingly innocuous tuft of air
smell the ground and the atmosphere as you walk

to and ﬁom class, noddng the diﬂrerent stages of -

symbolic Order, or maybe you’ve even started
narrowing down a paper topic for ”Vtht N60 is
Right forYou."But ofcoluse,such along term enr
deavor brings with it its own dynarruc exegesis of
a corresponding emotional rollcrrcoaster of highs
and lows. As for now, we've already got plenty on

the table. 50 just relax and appreciate, laugh about,
take a whriir of or even insnumenrally overcome
Lhe beauty and burdens that October will ulna
matcly be sending our way. Maybe then we’ll be
liviri the dream.

Not satisﬁed? Deal with it,
