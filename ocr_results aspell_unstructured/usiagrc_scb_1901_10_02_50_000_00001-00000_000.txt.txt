NEITHER SXDE ABLE TO SCORE.

Arms and Grinnell Open the Football
Season With a Tie Game-"Vir-
tual Victory rur Grinnell.

In the game at Marslialltown
last saturday, between Ames and
Grinnell, neither side was able to
score. A iie game is never very
satisfactory, but in this instance
the general opinion seem: to be
that it was substantially a victory
for Grinnell. In the face of the
fact that Antes had had two weeks
longer training under an emcicnt
coach and'outwcighed tiie Gl’lnr
nell team eighteen pounds to the
man, none at the Scarlet and
_Black supporters anticipated a
Grinnell victory. The result is
that all are pleased with the show
ing the team made.

Arnes won the toss and chose
the ball, kicking off to E. S. Evans.
who returned it to the 20-yard line,
Then began a seriesofline sit-lash-
es and end runs that carried the
ball to the Ames' goa|~line, mak-
ing an aggregate gain ol ninety
yards and failing to secure a touch-
down only because of Collins' un»
fortunate collision with one of the
goal posts. Only once during this
time did Grinnell funlble.and even
then retained the ball.

After a short gain Amos was
forced to punt and Grinnell began
again the work of forcing the ball
down the ﬁeld. When within one
yard of the coveted goal, Grinnell
was held for downs,and the chance
or scoring was again lost. Penal-
ties imposed upon Ames assisted
Grinnell materially during ihe ﬁrst
half.

The second halt was largely a
repetition of the ﬁrst, except that
neither of the goabllnes was in
immediate danger. Ames took a
decided brace and put up a much
better quality of football, but was
not able to overcome Grilinell's
speed and aggressiveness. When
time was called the ball was in
Ames’ possession and on their
twenty-ﬁve yard line.

Interesting Talk at Alumni Hall, Sunday
Afternoon.

A very instructive and enter
taining talk was given by Mr.
Chas. Lynde, '96, of Des Moines,
in the chapel on Sunday after
Mr. Lynrle spoke from a
tamiiiarity born of an experience
whose incipiency dated trom re.
search work taken up along those
lines in his student days here. He
introduced his remarks by a short
sketch of the career of the settler
merit movement and dwelt upon
its seeming impossibility or deiini.
tion, because the deﬁnition of to-
day might not apply tomorrow,
so rapid is the progress of some
ofits phases, He stated tliata

noon.

{social settlement is not a reform

movement. It simply aiiords a

meeting place or all classes of‘

people and inserts‘a higher level
of living in the districts in which
it is established, Neither is a set-
tlemeilt a charity, although it is
always ready to ass ,t indirectly.
It is not an institution nor a pliil
antiiropy in the popular sense.
He characterized a settlement as
being a band of educated men and
women who live where they are
most needed and try to form a so
cial ccnter among the poor of at
ies.

The seitleinent at Des Moines
is called Roadside House and is
situated on the souilieast corner
of 8th and Mulberry streets, It is
maintained by personal conlribu»
tions. Mr. Lynde thinks it would
be very advantageous both to the
settlement and to the college to
have students undertake personal
work at ilie settlement along lines
approved by the workers there
and the proper college authorities
and to furnish reports on the re-
sult of their investigations. and he
hopes that in time the work will
assume the scope oi similar work
carried on in the cities by some

 

of the larger universities. Sine
dents could make their home ai
the settlement at a cost of from
SIS to $20 per month. Winter is
ilie best time for such research.
A month ii the shortest space of
time that could with proﬁt be
spent in the work and it isthouglit
that ii Christmas vacation istaken
as the period, one week would be
given by the college both preced
ing and following the vacation,
thus making tour weeks in all,
which would be. in a measure, suf-
ﬁcient A number of subjects are

DRAKE GAME To BE PLAYED SAT
URDAY EVENING.

Theexhibition ganicwith Drake

University will be played next
Saturday night instead of Friday
night as announced some timeago.
This change is deemed advisable
by the nianagemeni because of the
prospect of a larger attendance’at
the game it played Saturday evellr
ing,

The game with Drake is a much
more important one than the game
with Anies last Saturday, and de
serves the support of all who are
intereslcd in the work of the team.

It a sufﬁcient number will go, a
special train at greatly reduced
rates can be secured. This is a
good opportunity to help tliecausc
along and to give encouragement
to a team that is to play against
great odds.

LATER—A special rate or one
dollar tor round trip has been se~
cured, providing three hundred
tickets can be sold.
