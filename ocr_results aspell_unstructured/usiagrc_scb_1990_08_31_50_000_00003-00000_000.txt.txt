New Students Settle in
for the Long Road Ahead

By Jessica Weisel

”They’re more conservative
than I thought,” said Aaron Wien
er, an incoming Grinnell freshman,
about the ramming Grinnell stu-
dents Lhat he met during New Stu-
dent Days.

Wiener was one of the 391 new
and returning students that arrived
at Grinnell on Saturday, Aug. 25
for the weekend aimed at preparing
freshmen for the transition to earn-
pus life.

Students began picking up keys
from the Nonh lounge of the F0»
rum at 8 am. on Saturday and
started moving suitcases and boxes
into the dormitories. Lectures and
activities were scheduled for the

afternoon and evening for parents
and students to provide advice on
managtng finances and planning
courses.

On Sunday afternoon, freshmen
met with their tutorial professors
to discuss registration, and, in
some cases, receive their first
assigmenls.

New students were also re
quired to attend sevetal mandatory
seminars and discussions. The
lecture on planning for a Grinnell
career by Charles Duke, dean of
faculty, was little appreciated by
Langan resident Aki Toyota, who
felt that he learned very little from
IL

Some new students, especially
thoselivingin Lriplesandquadruples

that were formerly doubles
and triples, found space to be a
problem.

One student who lived in a
Read quadruple last year was
asked to talk to the current occu-
pantsandtellthem thatitis possible
to manage.

But many of the occupants
found the situation easier to handle.
In somecases, furniture was moved
to create additional room inside
Liz Rewey,wholivesin Read said,
“We just had to organize the desks
so we each had our own space. We
just have very little of iL”

President Drake said that he
was considerably impressed with
the new students, whom he found
“affable”.
