New System of Scoring Designed
To Prevent Two or Three
Stars Carrying Meet.

The first half oi‘ the annual inter»
dormitoly indoor track meet will be
run off Saturday morning beginning
at nine o'clock. The events on the
program for this WCck arc the Ryan}
dash, the shot put, the three lap race
and the tour lop race.

A ncw system or scaling will be used
this year, each map cntercd scoring
at least one point. 'l'h man winning
tlrst place will be credited with as
many points as there are men entered,
and so on down, the last man winning
one point. This will prevent a build-
ing lrom entering only two or three
men, and winning the meet, as was
done last year.

The only exception to this rule will
be in the case of thc anyni'tl dash in
which only the first four places will
count.
