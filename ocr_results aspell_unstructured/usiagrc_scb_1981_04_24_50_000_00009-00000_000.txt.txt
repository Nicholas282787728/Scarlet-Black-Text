another Vietnam?

one oi the most striking ieaiures of
the current US debate on El Salvador
is the propensity of the Reagan ad
ministration and its opponents to View
the situation as an exact repeat of the
revolution in Vietnam which began
some 35 years ago. El Salvador, similar
to Vietnam, is seen to have a local coms
munist insurgency directed by the
Soviet Union and its allies which
threatens to overthrow the current
government and to infect the surrounr
ding area with its ideology, However,
the two sides draw very different con-
clusions lrom the analogy. For Presi-
dent Reagan, the task is to mobilize efr
fective counterlorce to contain con-ls
munist expansion in El Salvador. ln~
cluding us, military aid and advisers,
so that the situation will never get out of
control necessitating U S. troops as
happened in Vietnam For much of the
opposition the point is not to intervene
at all in El Salvador because we shall
soon slide down the slippery slope oi
military involvement into quagmire
and disaster similar to that experienc
ed in IndesChina.

Indeed, there are some parallels bet-
ween the situation in Vietnam in the
19505 and 19605 and the situation in El
Salvador today, in both instances. the
established governments appear corn
rupt and repressive, social injustice is
rife, the Marxist insurgency gets its
support lrom the outside, both sides act
with brutal ruthlessness and the
war is fought in tropical Jungle condir
lions. -

But El Salvador displays as many dilr
ferences as Similarities and these Ought
to be taken into account by all sides.
First, El Salvador has a Very different
historical tradition It has been an in
dependent country since the l9th cen
tury: hence, the current revolution in
no way appears as a national struggle
for independence as in Vietnam. Se-
cond, the revolutionary forces in Vietr
nam were highly unified and wells
disciplined with an esteemed national
leader in Ho Chi Minh after righting
successively the Japanese. French and
Americans while the Marxist forces in
El Salvador appear to have neither uni-

ty, discipline nor a leader at national
stature. Third, during the US, anOlVe‘
menl in Vietnam, the important thing
ior the revolutionaries was to reunily a
country artilicially divided by the great
powers at the WM Geneva Conference
with most or the military support com»
ing lrom national compatriots in the
North. El Salvador, of course. is
already a unified country and it is not a
very good comparison to consider
Cuban support as equivalent to that
from the North Vietnamese.

Fourth, by the time the Americans
got involved in Vietnam, there was no
uncorrupted leadership to oppose the
revolutionaries. In this respect, the
Situation in El Salvador is very dif-
ferent in that the Roman Catholic
Church, exerts a strong force ior
moderation and social justice. The late
Archbishop Romero even laid down his
lile in martyrdom for his cause. Finals
ly, in Vietnam, the government never
dealt with the underlying causes of
revolution, just with the military symp-
toms. Until recently, the government in
El Salvador has taken a seemingly
similar course But in the past two
years, after strong u s, prodding. the
government has undertaken an exten-
SlVe land relorm program which has
redistributed the land of all [arms over
1,200 acres {about 15 percent of the total
farmland? into cooperatives and is
about to distribute individual plots to
sharecroppers, The first evaluative
data show that production levels have
been maintained and that the effort is
winning the loyalty of the ailected rural
poor.

The situation in the United States is
diriereni too. At the beginning of the
\var.m Indochina there were only a
handful of experts in the United States
who knew anything about the region,
Indeed. there was no one to raise the
alarm about the dangers oi America's
military commitment until we were so
deeply involved that it was impossible
to extricate ourselves easily. in those
days or anti-communist Cold War con-
sensus, neither press nor public opinion
raised more than the faintest objections
to ever increasing military Involves

ed in a major war. Clearly, El Salvador
is different in all these respects and the
dangers oi slipping into an unwanted
military involvement are reduced.

I think there is a major problem in in-
ternational relations. one to which we in
the United States are particularly
susceptible — each crisis tends to be
confused with the one which Came:
before; or, as the military would put it-
~ we tend to fight the last war. U.S. ac
tions as a result are frequently inap-.
prapriate. Thus. when Hitler came to
power in the [9305 we contused this
situation with the one which existed in
Germany at the time of World War L:
When Stalin became a threat after;
World War II, we equated him with-
Hitler. When war broke out in Korea in.
1950, we saw a similar phenomenon to
German aggression in World War 11.

We should avoid making the mistake -
in El Salvador of confusing the revol -.
lion there with the one in Vietnam. I
believe President Reagan is terribly-
mistaken to treat the situation as a
communist military insurgency requir- '
ing us. military help; his actions could ,
in fact undermine the United States in >
Latin America and strengthen radical »
forces there. On the other hand, I think i
the critics are wrong to the extent that :
they advocate a handsoff policy; that
the United States has no interest in in- i
volving itself in El Salvadort I believe:
there is much that we can and must do.
Military involvement and military aid
are wrong but there are many opporr .
tunities to give economic and
humanitarian assistance through the
church and other agencies to create
positive incentives for the present
government to continue with the land
reform program and other social
relorms to help eliminate injustice and
poverty and to improve the quality of
life, It seems to me that comparing the
situation to Vietnam can only be
counterprodirctive for these purposes.
