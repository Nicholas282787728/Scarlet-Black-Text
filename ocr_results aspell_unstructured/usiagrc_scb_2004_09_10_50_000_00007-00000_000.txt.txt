Exploring The Disasters of .War

Students present Francisco Goya’s famous prints of the Napoleonic Wars in an exhibition at Faulkner Gallery.

BY CID STANDIFER

Etehings or decapitated and disr
membercd corpses, impaled soldiers
and dead mothers have replaced the
complex diagrams depictrng intrrcacres
of the global eeonomy in the Faulkner
Gallery. The hundred year-old im-
ages of Francisco de Goya's Dori-rm
a/VVm‘ series may seem just as relevant
as the modern Gladn/Nawm/sr exhibit
they replaeed.

Last spring, the Grinnell college
art department entrusted 12 students
with the task of cur ating an exhibit fea-
turing one of thc most famous artists
in history 19th century Spanish prime
maker Francisco dc Goya. The work
on display is an soeprint series called
Danton ofWaz, which depicts mangled
corpses, torture, and executions that
took plaee in Spain during the Napo-
leonic Wars (1808»1814).

Goya is renowned for his teehnie
cal skill and innovation in the ﬁeld of
printmaking, but also for his role as
one of the ﬁrst artrsts to use his work
as a medium for dissent and subversion.
According to student curator Kather-
ine Rochester ‘05, the serics is the ﬁrst
to depict the tragedies of war in an
emotive mannerﬁGoya set the stage in
this genre for later masters like Pablo
Picasso and South African artist Wil-
liam Kentrldge.

In 1983 ex-protessor Emeritus Hcl»
en Pereas de Ponseti and her husband,
Dr. Ignacio ele Ponseti, gave the College
a copy ofthc rare sixth edition Ofprinlsr
The sixth edition is especially wtluable,
according to Rochester, because of the
manner in which it was printed. Most

of the editions printed after Goya’s
death were darker than the original, but
the sixth edition is closer in lightness
to the copy that Goya printed himself.
Thus, out ofal.l the editions, the sixth
probably comes closest to presenting
rhe images as Goya wanted them.
Since the prints were donated to
Grinnell, they have been used to teach
introductory art history courses yet
have not been displayed as a complete
series. According to the curator of the

permanent collection, Kay Jenkins, the
prints are sensitive to light, so the art
department decided to display them in»
frequently in order to preserve them for
future generations.

The members of an art history
seminar course taught by Susan sitaue
bot last spring labored for the entire
semester to put together the gallery
exhibition, The last time a similar
course was offered was in 2002, when
professor Jenny Anger led students in

putting together an exhibit on German
Expressionism. The art department
chooses the subject of an exhibition
and then puts the project in the hands
ofa group ofstudents.Thc department
chose the subject based on the specialty
ofthe professor reaehing the eourse and
what is available in the art department’s
permanent collection. While Goya is
not the main focus of Straubcr‘s career,
his work does fall rnto the realm ofthc
19th century work that Strauber spe—
cialrzes rn. The students spent the ﬁrst
half or the semester studying Goya's
life and worlts in depthThey then split
into groups to crcatc multiple propov
als eoneerning how to present the work,
and as a group they selected aspeets of
eaeh proposal to rnelude in the final
plan for the cxhibrt. While the show
opened over the summer, since few stu-
dents were on earnpus, an opening was
not held until Sept. 3. At the opening.
the Ponsetis presented another Goya
print to the students as a donation to
the permanent collection.

While the students see parallels
between Goya‘s works and the carnage
on the news every night in lraq, they
decided not to focus on this in their
presentation of the works. Rochester
said “there's so many ways to view these
prints, and we felt that to be pushing
one way is really not being honest to
Goya's work." Student curator Nicole
Bungert ’06 said that “as fat as patrio—
tism, grotesque images of war, other
atrocrtres like ﬁre and famine, they're
very universal in that regard. But in
sonre ways they’re very speciﬁc [to
Goya's era]."
