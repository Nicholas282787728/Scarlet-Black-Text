VICTORY!

by I, Peter Rubin and Paige Shuman

Two goals early in the third period and
l7 saves bv freshman goaltender Dave
Shane enabled the Grinnell Nighthawks to
skate to a 2-1 victory over the University of
Iowa's Gold Team.

Led by captain Steve Rowe and backed
by nearly a full roster, Grinnell faced off
against' Iowa on the “home ice" of
McElroy Arena in Waterloo.

Shane was the key factor in an aggresive
Grinnell defense which kept the first
period scoreless. with 4:14 left in the see
cond, Iowa's Hailey caught Shane out of
the crease for the only Gold goal of the
night.

The Nighthawks ﬁnished the second
period with a more aggresive offensive
strategy. with John Ekey and Matt Arnold
doing time in the penalty box for elbowing
and butteending with 3:417 left.

Grinnell clearly dominated in the third
period, spending a majority of time with
the puck on Gold ice, Assisted by Tom
Margarita and Ekey, freshman Geoff Lar-
son slapped one in early in the third. Iowa
was unable to contain the explosive
Nighthawk offense, and the winning goal
was scored by Ekey with 13:55 left in the
game. Matt Arnold and Van Barry were
credited with the assist. >

The Victory was not only uie iirst of one
season, but the first in the hockey club’s 14
year history. The game was attended by a
very vocal Grinnell crowd of over 50 from
the “Booze Cruise”, a promotional trip ar»
ranged by club members J. Peter Rubin,
Steve Rowe, Dave Shane and Dennis
Gerhardstei

Despite the pleasantly warm weather
last weekend, Pioneer shooting was in the
deep freeze as the women made just 19 of
65 tries from the floor in a 62-49 loss to ll-
linois College.

“Psychologically, we knew it would be
tough going down there because we always
dread the officiating,” Coach Dee Fair-
child remarked. ”It was a little better this
year than in the past two years, but it was
still tough. I just wish we were as ag»
gressive as the fouls against us would in-
dicate," she added.

The team’s shooting aside, Fairchild'

commended the women for lmprovement
in rebounding (a 48—33 edge), “running the
offense and being aggressive on defense."
She particularly noted Laura VanSickle,
who had 15 points and led both teams in re-
bounding with 14, and Liz Schumacher,
who had 10 points and 9 rebounds.
Fairchild also lauded point guard
Jessica Toft, who had eight rebounds, and
freshman Amy Johnson, who had seven
points. Commenting on Johnson‘s perfor-

mance. she said, “I was very impressed
with how well Amy played and moved on
the court, especially considering the short
time she played.”

After a 3526 half-time deficit, Grinnell
came back strongly to tie me score at 57,
before ialling 67-60 to detending South
Division champion Cornell here last
Wednesday.

The Pioneers trailed the entire game but
slowly chopped away at the lead until uiey
were behind by just three points with a
minute remaining in regulation time. A
pair of free throws by VanSickle narrowed
the margin to one before Cornell's Genny
Dettmer hit one of two free throws to move
the Rams ahead by a bucket. A layup by
Schumacher with :021eftsent Grinnell into
its first overtime ol the season.

It looked like a different Pioneer team to
start the ovetime. as Grinnell registered
five turnovers in their first five posses-
sions. Cornell capitalized and pulled ahead
to stay.

VanSickle led all scorers with 27 and also
led Pioneer rebounders with 9.
Schumacher was U19. only other Grin-
nellian in double figures with 17.

The Pioneer women close out their con-
ference slate at home against Monmouth
on Saturday at z p.m. and Knox next Tues-
day at 5:30 pm. They will wind up their
season with a road trip to Dubuque next
Thursday to take on Clarke.

“Monmouth, Knox, and Clarke are all
games we can win,” stated Fairchild.
“Clarke is not as strong as it has been in
the past, We've played Knox and Mon-
mouui already and know that we are
capable of beating them. Playing at home
will hopefully give us the extra edge we
need,” she added.

SD much for tradition. Darby gym-
nasium, once proven to be a haven tor the
Pioneer basketball team, was ﬂ'le site of
two demoralizing defeats this past
weekend for Grinnell. But as it is true in
many other cases, what appears in the
Win-loss column is not reflective of the
team‘s play 7 it is a shame that is the only
statistic that counts.

Coach Smith used adjectives such as
“crazy" and “quirky” to describe Friday
night’s game. What unfolded with the Il-
linois College Blueboys was definitely not
run-of-the»mill basketball. After yet
another overtime battle, the Pioneers fell
on a lastesecond desperation throw. losing

,Despite this heartbreaking deieat,
Coach Smith was not the least bit ashamed
of his team's performance 7 and with due
cause, “I really applaud the guys for the

The 1987 edition of the Pioneers’ men's
baseball team began practice last week
under the direction of carcaptains Ian Lin
and Tom Monogue. The team, which last
year finished fourth in the Southern Divie
sion of the Midwest Athletic Conference,
will not be under the supervision of coach
John Marlinek. Coach Martinek will be
taking a ten-week sabbatical to Arizona in
order to observe the baseball and football
programs at Arizona state University, as
well as the Chicago Cubs’ spring training
workoum.

In Martinek's absence, the baseball
squad will he coached by John Pfitsch,
who is currently the men’s soccer coach
and last coached baseball eight years ago.
Pfitsch took control of the practices this
week in anticipation of preparing the team
for its spring break trip to Texas, where it
will play a series of exhibition games with
Ranger Junior College. The Pioneers’
regular season begins with a pair of home
doubleheaders on Saturday, March 28,
against William Penn. and Tuesday,
March in, against Simpson.

Although Pfitsch is not familiar with this
current group of players, he has already
said that they are a better collection of
athletes than any of his previous baseball

order: there is no reason [or Grinnell to
hang their heads low. Illinois College 7

size and speed, with a quality forward in

from the ozone layer.

Regardless of the outcome, Friday night
marked one of me best games the Pioneers
have played. They crashed the boards
hard, posting a 15»rebound edge, and had a
balanced scoring attack, Terry Chapkc led
the Club with 25, followed close by fellow
guard Eric Whitaker who knocked in 18.
Captain Daryl Scott dished in 17, and Dave

teams He believes that one of the reasons
that Grinnell has had problems in the past
competing with other Iowa colleges IS due
to the fact that we do not usually have
many small-town players on our rosters,
This year, however, the squad has two
freshmen Iowans, pitcher John Bollard
and catcher/utility man Mike Mohan, who
Pfitsch hopes can have an impact.

The 1937 Pioneers are a young team
(there are no seniors) who will be led by
returning lettermen Wallace Squibb. Ran-
dy Seeley. and Tim Manatt in the infield;
and by Monogue, Lin, and Brad Sheridan
in the outfield. A large key to the Pioneers'
success may be the arm of pitcher Jim
Weiand, who last year was one of the con~
ference's top throwers, although he was
only a freshman.

The above players and the rest of the
team are being schooled under Pfitsch's
philosophies of mental preparation and
visualization. Pfitsch stresses that a high
level of intensity be maintained for each
game in order for the team to have suc-
cess. Though it is early in the pre-season,
the response to his teachings has been
positive. The players are aware oi the suc-
cess that Pfiisch has had with the soccer
team and hope to duplicate the feat on the
diamond.
