“A PROTECTIVE VENEER"

A Grinncll cocd's answer to “Mrs.
Jeclryl and Mrs. Hyde", an editorial
first published in The Minnesota
Daily and reprinted in The Scarlet
and Black Sumrduy.

We present-day girls, the post-
war generation, filld ourselves in
a very difficult position when we
leave our homes to seek our own
livelihood and amusements. We
find that the world isn’t crowded
to overﬂowing with young men
anxious to shove the gold band on
the right finger and hand over 2t
marriage liccnse as our prc—war
mothers have led us to believe.

'Wc find that, contrary to all
teachings, mar age and children
are considered two extremely
amusing jokes and that lch is on
game to he played at rather than
taken seriously. So, because we
are working in the business
world, an essentially masculine
one, we play the game the man’s
way. “To (loll a hard rolleer‘to

year ulltil the cxchequer won’t
stretch any further. Then we at-
tend P.T.A. meetings, play bridge,
and get fat, So we have the great
American middle class.

A few of us, the most nttrat ivc,

collect husbands and lap dogs in

The rest of us look the situation
over and decide that the game
isn’t worth the prizes, nine-tenths
of which are consolation anyway.
We settle down to enjoy our owll
freedom among our own friends.
We take out any latent maternal
instinct in sending clothes and
toys to our rcllttivcs’ children and
to homes [or unwanted babies. We

EG_
VALUE OF COLLEGE
(The Minnesota Dolly)

It seems to be the favorite pastime
of professors in schools of business
to try to figure out whether or not
it pays to go to college, From their
reports, of course, it always pays.
The most recent investigator is Prof.
James c. Eggert, of the Columbia
university business school, whose re
part shows business ‘school graduates
earning salaries ranging from $360 to
$100,000.

one item that is noticeably lacking

in most attempts to determine the
value of a college diploma is the
amount of expenditure ncccssary to
get the diploma, in any business ven-
ture, in order to figure the ultimate
profit one must begin with the orig-
inal expense which must be deducted
from the returns. Therefore, in figur-
ing out the value of a college educa-
tion, its costs should be considered
and not just the salary of the grad—
hates.
The wide range between the salar-
ies of graduat‘zs, $350 to $100,000,
would indicate that a college educa—
tion is not always a paying proposi-
tion-A college education is of value
only in proportion to the graduate‘s
ability to make use of such education.
As many an unemployed graduate
can tell you, college is no royal road
to success, What you got out of col-
lege depends largely on what you
bring to it. If you are the $100,000
man, you may require the university
to help you attain the rnn‘xirnupi of
your potential ability. But if you are
the S360~a-yedr man you are wasting
your time and money in college.

l Campus Opinion i

In your opinion, what is the most
outstanding feature of Grinnell col-
lege?

Claude Sniun; The housing system
whereby a unified, fraternal organi-
zation has resulted in a democratic
atmosphere for which Grinnell coir
lege is noted.

Paid Trigg: The wide range of soc-
ial occasions for an extremely low
cost. students of Grinucll college
have open houses, formal and infor-
mal dances, dinners at the dormitory
and quadrangle, lectures, athletic
events and afternoon danccs for a
comparatively nominal sum.

Joe Mnnderfel The democratic
spirit between all persons. The fact
that a great number of students
Work part of their way through
school and it creates no social differ-
ence among the students.

Robert Sutton: I believe the frn-
ternal spirit between professors and
students is one of the outstanding
features of Grinbcll college. The
buildings have many dinners at year
to entertain the professors. This way
the student understands and likes the
professor while in turn the professor
understands and becomes acquainted
with thc student.

John Shephnrtl: Grinnell‘s biggcst
feature is the fact that it is like Reno
in that “Grinnell is the biggest little
college in the country." The close u's—
snciutiun brought about by the size
of the college, makes Lincoln’s state
ment of “all men being created equal"
to be the truth.

LIFE INSURANCE—THE
SUSTAINER

More and more frequently during
the lz‘st few months, when our nation
and the rest of the world has been
expcriencing one of its periodic eco-
nomic turmoils, we have henrd ex-
pressions such as, Life Insuranceithe
Bulwark of The Nation—tho Buch-
bone of industry—tho Stabilizer,¥
the Economic Foundation, orkThe
Sustainer. Such expressions have re}
suited from the realization of thcl
value of life insurance. During times
of economic stress when most curvesi
dip to the base—line, life insurance,
meeting the test in every way, looms‘
to the fore as a solid and sound foun-
dation of our economic structure. Let
us delve deeper to see why lifc insur-
ance has pl‘oven itself The Sustaincr
“Kaleidoscopic Observation"

Let us, for sake of presentation
consider the relations of life insuran—
ance during times of depression with
the government, with industry, and
with the individual. By such a kaleido-
scopic observation, we may be able
to determine the reasons for life in—
surance being the Sustainer.

Life insurance plays an important
role in the financial affairs of the
government, both state and national.
A government requires huge sums of
money for operation, and those funds

“Have Inveslznent Funds"

The life insurance companies,
because of their steady premium
income from new and Old busi-
ness, have funds for investment
purposes. Because the life insur~
ance companies want to maintain
a Semi-liquid position With Shari:-
tenn and stable securities, a great
portion of the available life insurance
funds are placed in government se-
curities. This source of funds on-
abIES the government to maintain its
stahi 'ty and carry out its works
which aid economic recovery. The in-
come of the government is reduced
during these times because of lower
assessment and nonpayment of
taxes, so, consequently, without the
life insurance source of available
funds, it would be unable to carry out
the SlEps that it does to aid the eco-
nomic recovery of industry and the
individual. During the normal times,
life insurance provides the bulk of

“Imluls ﬁnance industry"
Life insurance has similar relations
itll industry. The large and basic in-

dustries of our country, such as rail-
roads and public utilities, have

al-
ays been financed to a large extent

by life insurance funds. Our transpcr.
tation systems of our public utilities,
because of their huge fixed assets,
require millions of dollars from a
stable source. '
investments must be dependable, for
if they were “dumped” for cash dur-

Now let us consider life insurance

mg times of depression. perhaps, be-
cause of unemployment, an individual
may need funds for operating cx-

him. Perhaps, the investments of an
individual, such as his business, may
