The Way the Volleyball Bounces Soccer Women Earn 4th
Shutout Against Big Bens

By Julie Kaster

In last Saturday‘s match against a
highly talented Simpson squad,
Grinnell was overmatched in every
position and fell in three straight
games of 3-15, 5-15, and 3-15.
Simpson hit very hard, especially
when Grinnell set them up by mis-
placing passes over the net.

“The Simpson hitters were excel-
lent and i expect us to use the expe-
rience to come out strong againist
Luther and University of Wiscon-
sin-Stout because their hitters sim-
ply will not compare," coach Sheila
Cain said.

Tuesday night Grinnell partici-
pated in the Luther triangular, meet-
ing Luther and Wisconsin. The first
match was against the home team
and Grinnell was psyched to avenge
their own home court loss earlier
this season. The Pioneers came out
playing sman. and aggressive. capi-
talizing on Luther’s fie/e balls.

The game was tied at 7-7 while
both team’s battled through two full
rotations, but the ticwas broken when
Grinnell’s intensity faltered and the
game came to a quick close at 7715,
Luther.

In gametwo,several inexperienced
players were allowed valuablecourt
Lime. The lack of experience, ac-
cording to Coach Cain, was the pri-
mary reason for the second game
loss of 2-15. Since Luther is not in
Grinnell‘ 3 conference, the match was
used to prepare players for future
games

Grinnell faced Wisconsin in the
second match. The Pioneers smyed
close, but were still unable to achieve

victory when they failed to maintain
their concentration level through the
last few points of the game. The ﬁnal
score was 12-15.

In game two Grinnell began by
digging themselves into a lO»point
hole. The unit then showed their
mettle by pulling themselves back
into the game.

Mental lapses hindered the tm‘s
rally as several cmcial serves were
missed and the game ended at 945,
in favor of Wisconsin.

The struggle with complete cone
cenuation damaged an otherwise imr
pressive 84 percent total serve come
pletion for the evening‘ Passing
remained a stumbling block for the
Pioneers as they placed only 59
percent of their passes to the setter.
This resulted in only 82 hitting ate
tempts in the four games,

Grinnell’s kill leader was Susan
Egbert with 13. Amy Robinson was
the most consistent hitter, success
fully completing 92 percent of her
hits.

Grinnell’s current record of 2—12
is better than at this time last season,
and strong performances by several
young players have sparked the
team’s enthusiasm and boosted their
confidence

Freshman Jocelyn Keough dis
played her strength in blocking and
wasSS percent in hitting in adjusting
to the middle hitter position after
being shifted from outside hitter to
replace Beth Prullage. Also. sopho~
more Maude Logsdon played con-
sistently well in her varsity debut

“We are still searching for the
combination which clicks and until
then there will be plenty of linerup

Waterpolo Loses Two at Iowa

By Caryn t. Platt

Last Saturday morning, the Grin-
nellwaterpolo team took on both the
A and B squads of the University of
Iowa. Some Grinnell team members
wished they could have had more
time to practice.

Kevin Doerschug tried to beposi-
tive, however, when he said that the
ﬁrst match, against the B team, was
definitely the better of the two.

While Doerschug could not recall
the scores of either of the two
matches, he was quick to point out
that they were really not all that
important.

Rather than focus on the blow-by-
blow events of the matches, Deer»
schug commended Chris Liu. a
sophomore who has been out of the
picture for a year due to shoulder
injuries, forjumping in and playing
“some of the best goalie” he had ever
seen.

Doerschug said the team’s per-
formance was “nothing to complain
about”

“Game situations are a lot differ-
ent, and they probably learned as

much in an houras they have in all of
our practices,” he said.

Freshmen John Fuson and Brain
Gumbs, new members of the team,
both had positive responses to the
game.

Fuson said that the team played as
well as could be expected. having
only half as many players as Iowa‘s
team. Gumbs said the game “was a
learning experience in a big way.”
butalso added that he had seen what
“practice can do for a team.”

This weekend, Grinnell will be
hosting a tournament with Iowa
State, Knox and Macalaster. The
tournamentwili beround-robin, with
each team playing all of the other
teams.

Because of the huge difference in
the caliber of opponents, Doerschug
has different goals for the team for
each of the matches. Whatitall boils
down to, though, is that he hopes the
team will work together effectively
and successfully

Grinnell‘s first match is against
Iowa State at 8:30 am. on Saturday,
and they are looking for all the sup-
port they cari get

 

changes," Coach Cain said.

”These changes get people needed
experience and everyone must be
ready to play because no matter how
we do during the season, it is the
Midwest Conference Tournament
that we are looking toward. Our
biggest goal is to improve our con-
ference placement," Cain said.

The volleyball team is at Mon-
mouth this Saturday and then back at
home to take on Knox Oct. 14 at l
p.m.

Women’s Rugby Drops 2 vs. Luther
and Carleton, But Remains Optimistic

By Paige Shuman
and Terra Ge get

The women’s rugby team faced

two tough games against Luther and
Carleton this past weekend, and the
results were as they have been for
most of die season, Although Grin-
nell lost both games, their play had
several brightspots, includinga great
team effort to hold both of their op-
ponents scoreless in the second
halves and several outstanding indi—
vidual performances.
. In the first game, Grinnell faced
Luther, a team they had lost to two
weeks earlier 8-4 and 60 in their
home openerr

Grinnell played well defensively
in the first half, with fullback Vicki
Reich making several tough saves.
The scrtimmies stayed all over the
ball,buttheLutherwomen managed
to break through with two quick tries
up the weak side to take an 8-0 lead.

Grinnell finally cametolifeoffcn-
sively after the second-half‘s open-
ing lock-off.

Kristen Brown had the good foot
and offered several leather balls to
heaven. Kirsten Finlayson trampled
overmanyLutherwomenand picked
up an awesome tripping penaltyt
Becky Lansky also gained a lot of
yardage on several nice runs.

The highlight of the game came
when Maria Wenzl made a more
than 50-yard run through several
large Luther women to score the
only Grinnell try of the day.

Defensively, Grinnell was able to
hold its opponent scoreless in the
second half, largely in pan to the
play of Tara Van Wart, who allowed
the Luther team very little motion in
the backfield 7except to the ground.
However, despite great defense and
several more closecalis offensively,
Grinnell was unable to score again,
When the whistle blew, the score
was Luther 8, Grinnell 4.

Grinnell was back at it again half
an hour later as they faced Carleton
for the ﬁrst time in a year.

Carleton scored early in the first
half on along breakaway and kicked
the extra for two, making the score

60. Grinnell got close to the try line
several times. but was unable to get
across that elusive white stripe.

In the second half, Lara Puglielli
started things off with a more than
40-yard kick, Thescrum, charged by
outstanding performances by Mary
Beth Diener and Heather Flanagan
hung tough,keptCarleton toascore-
less second half,

Butonceagain,Giinnellalsocame
up scoreless, losing 60.

According to Captain Julie Sliv-
insky, the losses weren’t important.
“I‘m really excited about this team.
This is the best set of games we’ve
ever had, and things just keep get»
ting better,” she said.

Grinnell heads to Iowa City this
weekend for the select sides touma-
ment, where they will face the Uni-
versity of Iowa, the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, and Luther.
The toumament is especially impor-
tant because outstanding perform~
ances can earn players a spot on the
Select Side team for the Iowa-Wis-
consin region,
