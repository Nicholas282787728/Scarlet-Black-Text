. Before Appreci

by Dorothy Jordan ‘

Wednesday night a Grinnell
audience was privileged to hear
one of the most outstanding con-
certs the college concert series
has presented.

Arthur Gold and Robert File
dale held their audience capti-
vated under a spell of beauti—
iul music excellently performed
from the opening notes of the
quiet “Sicilianne” of Bach until
the final: cadence of the Charm-
ing “Valse Musette" by Francis
Poulenc. ,

The program was interesting
and varied. The opening num»
her by Bach was iolowed by ,
the Mozart Sonata in D. The ‘
clarity and accuracy with
Which the artists performed
this sonata was a lay to all
lovers oi the Mozart style,
and an inspiration to admir-
ers of technique.

The second section of the
program consisted oi Variations
on a Theme of Beethoven ‘by
Camille Saint»Saens. The French
composer created a series or
moods and styles around a strik-
ing theme, as the variations ran
the gamut of musical forms from
a most clear and emphatic state
ment of the theme to a irugal
treatment of the same subject.

The third section was a series
of short, quiet, mood pieces env
titled “Six Epigraphes Antiques"
This group of pieces was wri .
ten by Claude Debussy shortly
before his death and are Teln-
lively unknown. However, as
Mr. Fizdale told the audience,
the pieces are considered by
many musicians to be among the
best of the composer’s masterr
pieces. They were the quiet im-
pressions of the antique world.

The final group that Gold and
Fizdale presented was a series
of modern piano selections be
ginning with the South Amer-
ican flavor of Milhoud’s "BX‘BS’
iliera". Three selections from the
suite "Souveniexs’ by Samuel
Barber, which was written es-
pecially for the periormers, was

a’rive Audience

music of 1912, The ﬁrst 0'1 tth
pieces, ”Adagio,” remembersl
with nostalgia, while the “Two-
and the “Hesitation i
Tango" were light hearted.

The artists played three de»
scriptivc selections as oncores,
which were light and gay.
They were the “Walking Song," 1
by Thompson, “Playing Tag,"
a composition for children by
the Brazilian, Pinto, and the .
“Valse Musette" by Poulenc,
another number written es-
pecially tor the artists.

Artistically and technically
speaking we were treated to a
superb performance. As muslr
clans, the artists won the com-
plete admiration of the audience
and held them awerinspired from
start to finish. But more than
that Gold‘and Fizdale must be
admired for the variety of their
music, their complete mastery of
every mood and style, and their
charming personalities which ra-
diated even from the stage but
which became immersed into
one beautiful whole with each
other and the music as they
played. They made the audience
realize that they loved and en-
joyed their music, and they
knew how to take the audience
along on a never-to-be»forgotten
