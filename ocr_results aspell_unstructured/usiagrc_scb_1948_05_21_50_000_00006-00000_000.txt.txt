points came the pioneers' way
when Bill Berry ran an inspired
race in the Mil-yard dash to <ch
throne defending. champion Dc-
Morest of Monmouth. The niilc

gin of victory but Webb's 1/3
point in the pole vault and
Bliss’ point in the discus put the
meet on ice for the Pioneers.

Six indiiidual champions suc-
cessfully defended their crowns,
John Eonysta of Criiinell in the
100 and 220; McKay of Coe in
the shot put; Hopkins of Coc .in
the SSO-yard run; Zamzow of
Ripon in the high jump; McAdam
of Cornell in the two mile run,
and Halberstadt of Beloit m the
pole vault.

John Bonyats was the outstand-
ing individual performer of the
afternoon. with a record breaking
2l.2 for the 220, a 9,9 for the
100, and a blistering 49,3 anchor-
440 in the mile relay. Rlpon’s
zamzow was another standout
with firsts iii the high jump and
broad Jump, and a second in the
pole vault,
