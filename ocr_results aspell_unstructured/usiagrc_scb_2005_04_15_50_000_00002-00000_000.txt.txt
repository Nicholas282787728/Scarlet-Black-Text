Afro-Semitic experiences

This week Concerned Black Students and Ch-
itlutzim, the Jewish student group, cosponsored a se
ries ofcvents dealing with blackejewish telationoThe
first Grinncll college AfmeScmitic Experience Pro—
gram center-ed on a jazz conceit featuring duo Wailen
Byrd and David Chevan.

Elena Rubin ’07, the events coordinator for Che
alutziin,was pleased with the turnout for the conceit,
though she admitted that the attendance for othei
events was not quite as high. “There have heen a lot
of events that conﬂict with [the Afro-Semitic Ere
periencel," she said, “The people who have attended
events have really gotten a lot out ofit."

The Saturday night eoneert served as the kick-off
for a full week of events. Sunday night, the srudent
groups sponsored a showing ofthc PBS documentary
From Swastika tojim Crv'w. Professors hosted discus
sions Monday and Tuesday.

The week ended with a mega-class Thursday
morning during the convocation period. Katya Gibel
Azoulay, Anthropology, Ira strauber, Political Stir
once and Jonathan Brand. Political Science taught an
interdisciplinaiy class on the various legal cases that
established Jewish people and Arahs as racial groups
able to file racial discrimination complaints.

Rubin added that this event was the start ofwhat
she hoped would b: a tradition of collaboration be-
tween Chalutziln and CBS. “There is no doubt that
this is the beginning of tons of other events like it,"
she said.
