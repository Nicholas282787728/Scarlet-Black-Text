Despite all of the money spcnt on tuition. Grog
Sehrieber ’02 doesn’t feel like his classes prepared him for
his future career nturly as well as dic things he did instead
of his coursework. Instead, he and a number of other
Grinncll seniors, describe their most signiﬁtant college
experience as their involvement in one of Grinnell’s e‘nvia
ronmcntul activism groups. "Free the Flanerwas really how
we prepared ourselves for a career after we graduate,”
schtieher explained.

A numhet of senior Free the Planet memhers are pre.
paring themselves for cnriunec inro a rumor of cnviron.
mental activism. Schrieber. along with Fl'l’ers Vanessa
Pierce 02 and Matt Ewing 02, were recently selcercrl to
he part of Green _corps norr year, a prestigious one your
fellowship that trains recent college graduates in the ﬁeld
of cnvironmcnrul activism. 0f approximately 900 applir
rants, these dircc Grinnelllans were three of the forty so
lected nationwide. Schrieber, Pierce, and Ewing will spend
the next yar as what Schrieber all: “missionaries for the
environmental movement"~they will be contracted out
to various environmental organizations to orynlze and mo-
bilize groups to fight for environmental iiisticc.

Free the Planet seems to ho a hrcoding ground for ac-
cupational environmental activists. Seniorloe Mowers, who
is currently interviewing for a numhei of different posi—
tions with activist groups, explained his early frustrations
with environmentalism, and how he eventually found sat-
isfaction with larger—scale activism, espooially ut Grinnell.
Concerned about environmental issues. he remlls, “My
freshman or sophomorcyeas at school. 1 tried to stop dnw
ing. That lasted about nineteen days lwould walk around
the school picking up trash and itwas so frustrating. Sol
thought. how can I prevent the trash from ever getting on
rho ground?" Pietro recalled a similar motivation to work
for largeasml: change: "Fl‘P has widened my perspective
on how people can people can create changc. At first when
l thought ofenvitonmentalism I thought ofrocycling Now

All four of these Scnlol‘siMoWelSr Schrieber, Pierce,
and Ewing—joined Free the Planet at the heginning of
their freshman year, In Fall 1998. Pierce remiled that Fl'P
was only one of the many groups she signcd up for during
new student orientation her freshman year, but “l-TI’ was
the only one who made an cffort [to get me to the meet.

The four seniors also mentioned that one of the big

the friends they huve made. Mowcis said, “it's deﬁnitely a

have fun doing it, and you let others into it."

that ruitton increascs are particulaily had for studcnrs who
don’t qualify for need-based aid yct still cant afford to pay
full tuition.

“With hood—based aid, thcy’rc always really good at say-
ing liercs what you can pay. and we'll come up with rhc
tcsr, Garrett said. My oontorn is for people who dont
get need based aid” and cant afford the annual tuition in-
creases

Last month, Ford and SGA vice president Gabe
Rosenberg ’03 went to a trustee mooring in Texas undatked
for a guarantee that tuition would increase no more than
one percentage point ahovc the inflation rate cvcry ycar,

While trustees made no promises, Ford said, “they did
notjusr dismiss it out of hand," He urged smdenm to at-
tcnd Friday’s meeting if they wanted to show support for a
tuition guarantee.

several student leaders emphasized communicating
with the trusrccs rather than confronting rhcm. “The point
at which we hccomc ahrasivc is rhc point at which they

become more closed." said Younkersenalor David Croascy
'04.

“They're kind ofour oftourh, out they rtully care about
wharsrudcnts say," said prcsidcntial mndidate Katie Picpcr
'03, who udviscd uddrcssing tuition and financial aid con.
cerns in un "articulate, heartfelt, not.roo.cririrul wuy "

One reason for the tuition increases, Ford said, is that
rrusrocs are reluctant to dip too much into interest on tho
cndowmcnt, and try to raise revenues through tuition int
stead.

“They look at [tho cndowmcnt] as a savings account
that really should not he rouehcd," Ford suid.

in light oftht current recession, some students felt that
accessing the “savings account" would be justified.

“They need to be prepared for that hy heing willing to
dip in a little more than they want to," said John
Abramowin ’05,

Vice presidential candidate Dcvan McGranrihan '04
commcnrcd that Griniicll's financial aid program, even if
it isrir pcrfcct, is still hertcr than many othcr schools. An

McGrunahan added that when the state of Iowa our

funding for tuition giants, the financial aid notified him
ahout the thnnges in an email and told him the college
had already met the disercpaiiey.

“I think it's important to remcmhcr that the financial
aid omce isn't all bad," McGl'anahan said.

in a post to tho Blackboard discussion system, shaun
soutliworth ’04 said Grinnell’s financial aid offer hear our
all tlic other schools he applied to, “Ifthis year's torts pluoo
you hclow the poverty line the financial aid ofﬁce will
protty mueh go out of its way to accommodate you,"
southworth wrote.

"I am proof that any student regardless of eliiss can
uttcnd Grinncll,” he continued. “Trust me, you can't get
much lowcr rhun an [csriniatcd fatnily eonttihution] of
1am."

Nonetheless, tuition increases tcmain a concern for
many students. and Ford and other lcodcrs hopc pcoplc
will turn out for today's rriurcc forumsnot to protest, hut
to put a human fare on tuition and financial aid nuinhcrs.

The goal, one student said, is to “tug at [tho trustees]
