the fastest man in the state troni
a half to two miles. Captain
Chapman, of Drake. ltolds the
state record in the high huldles
and has tied the record this seas
son and has also recently broken
the world's record the pole
vault by clearing the bar attnelve
feet. He trill make an attempt
Saturday to bleak this record.
Tllcwelgllts will hrirtlly be cons

sharp competition between Wall

The chances. seem to favor a
victory by a laige score by Dralre
brrtsurpriscs may develop. The
meet will furnish a good opportune
ity to compare tlte strength of
Ames, Drake and Grinnell, and
will give some idea of the way
things will go at the state meet,
Drake has nearly all oi her last
year's point winners at state meet
and in Chapman and Thompson
has two of the strongest men in
the west. All should witness this
ntcet asitis one of the best of
the year and the last one on the
home grounds. Drake expects
to send a large delegation to
support her runners and with the
Grtnilell contingent the crowd
will probably be the largest or the
year excepting that at the state
high school'meet.

of the weights, which were coilr

won the mile and two mile. prob
ably did the best individual work.
FOI'Gl’lllnClI the showing made

Templeton was most noticeable.
The relay races were pretty races
to watch especially the halt mllc
which Grinnell won by two feet
