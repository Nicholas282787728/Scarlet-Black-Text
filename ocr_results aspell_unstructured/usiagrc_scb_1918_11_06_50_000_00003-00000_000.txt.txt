Rar- thlman, e\ 13, who recently
reee -cd a lieutenants commission in
the aviation corps, wr" cs to a Grin-
neil friend or his experiences at his
new location, Payne Field, West Point,
Miss.

The letter in part follows:

Wish I could take yell tor a ride
with no one of these days. I am hav-
ing a great lime at rt. (in reporting
hack to Soother Field, 1 found orders
transferring me to this ﬁeld and got
my clearance papers the some day. I
spent a da , and a halt getting over, rc-
porled here and was assigned to iiying
duty at once. it is a sort of advanced
school for pursuit pilots.

are here. All are M, A. officers wllo

are flying, that means resort-ed miliei
iary aviator and in this work it cor-'

responds almost to a college degree,
not 0: course in time, lint work done.

Mull Deep.

It has been raining for tlle last
Week. In fact it is so wet that occa-

sionally one sees an officer slushing‘

about in hip boots altho that doesn't
indicate the actual depth of the niud—
it feels deeper!
the ﬁeld paved with crushed rock,
about 30x15!) yards, 3. little road of tilt:
same material leading out to it and a
lucky or skillful pilot can tony his
"ship” out along this road and “take
off” from a solid place, thus aroiding
turning right side up and having to
be pulled out of the mud. Landing in
this, in very soft earth. a plane is apt

to stick its nose in the mild and I'Dlli
over on its back, causing a broken-
propeller and much erpressive and‘

forceful language.

They have rather queer ideas here
about sever- 1 things, but one tact
stands out clearly—the ship must he
in the air as much as possible. We
start in the morning at 6:45 and there
are ships in the air until 0 p. in.
unless it blows a. young hurricane and
you ought to see the crows come
home!
