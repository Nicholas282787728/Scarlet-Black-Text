To Grinnellians

ln Dual Mee‘l

Last weekend with its cold and
rain marked the beginning of the
“big pus .. for Grinnell’s im»
proving track team. as they
braved the foul weather condi.
tions along with a great many
or the nation’s top teams at the
44th annual Drake Relays.

In the preliminaries on Fri-
day, the Pioneer 440 yard re-
lay contingent found the corn-
petition a little too rough in
the open college division, and
failed to qualify for the finals
which were held on Saturday.

Saturday's races were a dlfr
ferent story for Grinneil fans, as
the Pioneer thinclads placed
third in the lowa college divl»
sion in both the 880 and mile
relays. In both cases they were
defeated by powerful Dubuque
and lows Teachers teams.

As a highlight to an already
busy week, Grinnell defeated
Simpson. 34.47, last Wednesday
in the only home meet of the
season. Meet records were brok-
en by Pioneer Terry Ellis in the
shot put, and by Simpson’s Wilk-
ins in the broad jump.

Ellis bested his own record
of 46’ 1" with a heave or 46’
ill/c". wilkins also broke his own
previous mark of 20' s" with
:2 leap of 20' 111/ ".

Both Wilkins and Ellis added
another victory. as Ellis won the
discusand Wilkins the 440 yard
run. other double winners were
Simpson’s Hoeppner in the lot:
and 220 yard dashes; Grinnell's
Dave Qutub in the mile and two
mile runs, and Bud Heusner in
both hurdle races.
