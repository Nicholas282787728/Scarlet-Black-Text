he would always dial to see how she was. John and
Jane decided to go on a trip with eaeh other horn

surprise, these rocks surrounded an Irish spring.
The water for the spring had a certain clarity and

Maybe it‘s my Imagination, but the new toilet pas
per doesn't look as fluffy a: it did when it ﬁrst came
on the scene a month or so ago. It’s almost like the
quilting is being phased out, and soon we‘ll be baek
to the one-ply wax paper we were using before. Plus,
the ﬂusher in the men's room on my fincris so stubs
born that I pretty much have to elimb up and stand
on the handle to get it to work. Pretty soon I‘m going
to have to rig up an elaborate senes of pulleys, and
maybe an extended handle (Torque = Force ' Lever
Arm) just to ﬂush the thing. With all the damage done
to my poor insides by Quad over the past seven se-
mesters, I'll need it.

There are so rnanythihgs to rant about this weeks
where should I start? First of all, why did this semes~
ter have to go so fast? Only two weeks left! Further-
more, in the remaining two weeks there are about a
thousand plays, performanees, (uncerts, and parties,
and it is impossible to see them all sinee prors are
doling out paper assignments like condoms from the
health renter. Moreover, along with the many papers
and performances that I will be gr rig in the next
two weeks, I‘ve taken to regularly writing random rants
(tour in so many weeks). One would assume that to
be therapeutic but being angry at the world is hard,
damm lshould just get a column. But that would
just give the newspaper person on my ﬂoor another
exeuse to call me stupid. 0h,.and please drive safely.
