lessor Gibson appears to be attempt?
ing to minimize theimporrance of the
issue by quantifying itsvaluein terms
of numbers. An individual‘s ethics
are worth a small amount. two
peoples’ abitmore,andpemapsif10
or 20 students came each year, the
impetus for action on alternatives
would ﬁnally be there. Thus, notonly
is the issue minimized by this type of
logic, but the individual is as well.
Would a student whose ethics are
part of a religious tradition be so
u'ivialized? For example. would aJain
student from India, whose tradition
of non»violence to any living organ—
ism is part of a tradition which pre-
dates Christianity by at leasrfrve cen-
turies be told so bluntly to spend her/
his own time and money to take an
introductory psychology or biology
class atanother university even though
she/he is already paying to attend
Grinnell College, or to fail every lab
involving non-human animals if she/
he still wanted to pursue the course?
I appreciate Gibson‘s attitude re-

 

garding negotiation for research pa-
per alternatives to nonvhuman animal
labs. Unfortunately her ideas are not
held by those in charge of Introduc-
tory Psychology and Biology 116.
Actually, research papers instead of
labs does noteven begin to broach the
subject of alternatives, and the alter
natives can be used over and over
again not only by different students
but by the same student in a reiterar
tive learning process. For a ﬁeld (e.g.
science) that stands normally on the
vanguard ofnew ideas and new tech
nology, it is contradictory to be so
opposed to allowing students of strong
ethical beliefs to utilize the latest in
educational technology. I hope that
Gibson's attitude of negotiation pre-
vails over the presentattitude and that
instead of bringing in more speakers
against animal rights (Psychology
Depanment, Fall, 1990, “The Costs
of Animal Rights”), tlte science dc»
partment would open its mind to the
value of individual ethics and the
opportunities inherent in the new al-
ternative technologies.

ing. Men who are devoted to fighting
“Nazism" and “racism" promote the
idea that they are still a big danger.
Having done so, they can present
themselves as valiantand heroic war-
riors against them. This sclf»drama-
tizing posture is common among libr
erals. Valiant and alone, they are strug-
gling againstpowerfulandentrenched
forces of oppression, Suddenly they
are ﬁgures in history, and their lives
have an importance they would not
have otherwise.

Even though Duke solemnly repu-
diates his past, people won't forgive
him for it and his name never appears
in the paper without “ex-Nazi" or a
similar phrase preceding it. That‘s

“The people's voices are very
clear," said Weng. For this reason,
many people in Hong Kong fear the
impending reuniﬁcation with Com-
munist China.

Sponsored as parlof Asian Awarer
ness weekby the Rosenﬁeld Program
and the Cowles»l(ruidenier Program
in Chinese Studies as part of Asian
Awareness week, the lecture raised
the question of whether the forces of
democracy and capitalism will enr

in the near future.

enough the way you are. We all have
merit.

2. After you find the merit in your
self, ﬁnd the merit in others. You
don’ t have to like everyone you meet,
but try to give everybody a chance.
Purge yourself of prejudice in all
forms, but understand that prejudice
is in everyone, People have a right to
be ignorant and stupid, but it isn't
mandatory.

3. Appreciate all you have. I’m
learning slowly and surely that my
life isn't the living hell I pretend it is.
Realize what’s imponanrtoyou, and
respect it, whatever it may be.

4. Lighten up. Humor is essential.
Don‘t be afraid to laugh at yourself.
The resrof us are doing it, sojoin in.

That’s it. I don‘t want to get all
weepy and melodramatic here. Be-
sides, l’m not going all that far away.
You'll still be able to catch me at the
Bar now and again.

Nation examined

“The British tried to develop Hon g
Kong because they felt sorry for the
people," he said. They also tried to
“introduce belatedly the process of
democracy.”

Although the British have rarely
put democracy into practice in Hong
Kong, there is enormous support
among the populace for a democratic
transition. Outof a population of5.6
billion people, one million marched
indemonstrations supporting the 1989
democratic movement in China and
thirty million dollars were raised to
support the students at Tiananmen
Square.
