coinciding with the 400th anniversary of
Galileo’s invention orthe telescope, Grinncll
College Will put on a theatre production this
weekend that captures and retells the life of
Galileo Galilei in a raw, gloomy and dark
slagmgt The production of Bertolt Brecht's
The Life ofG/Ilileo, directed by Ellcn Mcasc,
Theatre, is a huge endeavor, with 29 actor-s
playing over 50 parts. _

Set in the 1940’s, Brecht’s play takes the
audience on a journey from Galileo's inir
tial invention of his telescope, to his evens
tual trnl by the inquisition and subsequent
house arrest. 1t winds through various lo-
cales, from Florence to Rome, and even
brings in a carnival complete with singing,
dancing, and one character wearing an overt
sized mask that resembles a combination of
Galileo’s head and a cheeseburger. The pro
duction witnessed for the following review
was a dress rehearsal two days before open-
ing night.

The visual components of the play, de—
signed by Henry Reich’09, stand out, adding
that little something that makes Galilealeave
the realm of the ordinary and reach into the
mystical, In Act I, we see Galileo (Ben Fins
kelstein,’10) and his friend Sagredo (Eamon
Anderson ’09) work our the puzzle orJupi-
ter's moons, succeeding in an epic triumph

. ofscientific discovery. It evokes fantasies of
sleepless nights discovering the next great
breakthroughs in understanding.

The praise for this wonderful scene
should be mainly attributed to the lighting.
set and sound designers, as well as to Mease,
The actors in this scene became props. The
stage fills with dramatic lighting, beautiful
sound and awesome visual imagery to form
the main interest in the scene, all the while
Galileo and Sagtedo sit in solemn silence,
working out the puzzles ofthe unlvcrsat

This scene contrasts other more actor-
dominated scenes, where Galilee seems like
it could become a great production at any
moment, but instead remains just above
average, Many actors seemed to approaeh
the daunting task of representing multiple
characters by adopting a universally neutral
character without any nuanced depth be-
yond two emotional states: angry and loud,
or happy and quiet,

Some actors seemed very excited only
to act, say their lines, and reel their emoe
tionst But in this excitement, they lose their
characters because they forget that acting is
about reacting. Acting is more about the in-
teraction with the other people on stage and
With the plot line than it is about the indi-
vidual actor. When this lesson is forgotten,
a twoeway monologue between actors takes
the place of good dialogue

Emotions and actions are frequently

understand important dialogue between ac-
tors because their voices do not project far
enough to be carried around the hall.

Finally, it would be nice to see fuller den
velopmcnt ofcharncters besides the lead, but
they are too often lost in the overwhelming
stage presence ofGalileo. Nothing develops
without him, and the play grinds to a halt
when he is not on stage, but that happens
rarely,

In all, this lengthy production, roughly
three hours, is aptly suited for a Grinnell
audience that can get excited by dialogue in-
terspersed with Latin and scientific reasons
ing, and chalk full orthoughteprovoking and
motivating discussions on the truth of relic
gious philosophy and the power ofscience.

Be prepared to think, feel sad, and pos-
sibly become disillusioned with your pre-
existing image ot Galileo. This is not an
uplifting, feel good production, but it is an
excellent one. So take the time, get away
from your midscrns, and delight in some res
alistic scientific discovery.
