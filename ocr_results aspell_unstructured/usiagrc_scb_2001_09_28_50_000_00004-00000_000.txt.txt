Starring: Nurse Berry, A bunch ofBrlrish people.

E: This movie is very Brirish. Unforrunarely, lead
aerress Renee Zellweger isn'r. Throughout rhe movie
she rries using Bririshaeeenr, but rarelysuceeeds. She's
supposed ro be Bridget Jones, an overweight 32 year.

and Fantasy scenes, which aren‘t as good 3 rhc oncs on
Ally Merl, Her two suitors are her boss (Hugh Gmnt,
very British).who she inirially ductibn as, among orher
things, an “alcoholic, workaholic, and megalomaniac”:
and a childhood acquaintance (Colin Fitch, mildly Brizr
ish) who insults her, and who sh: calls boring. Aren't
rhere millions ofpeople in London?
