Wood Delights Large Audience
by His, Interpretation of
the Huidy—Gurdy Man.

i FRIJM THE GRITIBS CHAIR

Friday evening brought to us the
second play of this season which has
dealt with mecmnic aspects in the
Americanized Latin, But "Mister Ane
tonio," a product of Lhe prolific Tark-
ington's earlier period, is more than a
comedy—its satire on small town mor-
ality is compelling.

Obviously intended for the talents
of otis Shinner, “Mister Antonio" is
a one-man play, with a powertul char-
acterization of the hurdy-gurdy man.
It was surprising to see what the sup—
porting cast made of their roles de-
spite this natural liniitiation.

Under Mr. Trumbauer's direction,
with capital acting, “Mister Antonio"
became a splendid entertainment.

Mr. Wood did well by the Skinner
role. He blended into a perfect whole,
humor, pathos, and a great deal of
that thing which we call "humnness,’
He has a splendid voice, a contagious

' laugh, and an escellent'sum of panto-
mine.

Mr. Green's successful characteriza-
tion of Joe added to the humor. Miss
Schmeltz, Miss Read, Mr. Johnson,
and Mr. Hadley presented a quartet
of village characters that made us
forget the liberties taken by Mr.
Lewis in "Main street."

In the first act Mr. Peterson and
Miss Gifford furnished realistic Bow-

could not dislike Miss Parker, Miss

a pleasant trio in it play lull of un-

We are glad that the scenic stand-

were much avove the average.

THE QUESTION.

Would you like to have the chapel pro-
grams announced one mil in
Advance.

THE ANSWERS.

Genevieve Ashby: If the chapel pro-
gram should he announced in advance
I believe more people would go. In—
cidentally there would have to be com-
sistently interesting programs.

othlt ll‘carin: i do not think that
that chapel attendance should depend
entirely upon programs and therefore
I am not in favor of having then an-
nounced.

The student body should consider
the chapel sertice a respite from mor-
ning classes and a part of Grinnell’s
contribution to the spiritual uplift,

Personally I think the organ prelude
'a'nd postlutle are worth attendance in
lthemselves.

Itullv Krill? I do not think that

chapel programs should be announced
in advance for students would be in-
clined to attend only the favorite num-
bers. The pleasure of surprise would
be eliminated.
I Paul Spencer Ti’ood, Professor of
iEllgllsh: .\'o, i should not like to have
the chapel programs announced a
lit-cold in advance. chapel service is a
leligiolls selvice in \lhlch the name
of the speaker is of small importance
One does not go to chapel as one at-
Ltends a lecture to hear a particular
person speak,

lull Clinttortou, instructor in His—
(cry: I think such an announcement
would cut the attendance. According
to the standard or chapels this year
.no one has been poor enough to merit
Ia small attendance. Although pres
ljlldined in favor of certain speakers
students uould do well to attend all of
the chapel services.

Blanche Wilson: I believe that it
would be well to announce a few of
the chapel programs which are cer-
tain to he of general interest—in order
that all students might derive the
benefits thereof. As a rule, how-
ever, I think that annoucelnents of
chapel programs would cause irregu-
liar attendance and a tendency on the

when the topic would be one of par—

hm nonely, Assistant in the Li-
brary: I would like to have the chapel
programs announced. Frequently
some are disappointed in not hearing
something of especial interest because
they were not iniormed in advance.
