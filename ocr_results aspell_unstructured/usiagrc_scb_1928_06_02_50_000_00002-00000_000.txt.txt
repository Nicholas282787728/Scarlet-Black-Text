I’I ONEERING.

Displacing the present curriculum or twenty years
standing, a revised plan oi undergraduate study, designed
to open new and larger intellectual vistas to the student,
will go into eilect next September at Columbia university
in the liberal arts school. The ﬁrst two years will be
devoted to “orientation and discover , The junior and
senior years will be given to genuine work in preparation
for graduate or proressional study, or for ”the yet more
serious business of living a uselul and high-minded lite."

Despite the prominence of Columbia and its presi-
dent, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, we can not bow down
in humility and watch Columbia experiment with this
new type oi education. Grinnell college will hope pace
with Columbia university and inaugurate a similar system
when school opens in the rail.

As the result of more than two years ol intensive
research, president ilain has per-lccbcd his plan 10 install
a freshman orientation course wit its accompanying
client on the upper" classes. A successlul innovation
of this will again place Grinnell in the lead or pioneering
educational institutions and give it'd‘n impetus in‘lts lor-
ward movement, , '

A text book on classical reading edited by Everett
Dean Martin and John Erskine is used in the columbia
plan. Their plan includes such innovations as lecture
courses demanding neither prerequisites nor examina-
tions, and reading courses given cooperatively in differ-
ent but allied departments or study.

Another most important prrnclplc has entered into
the making or the new program. Every ellort has been
made to measure progress toward the bachelor's degree
in terms or real achievement rather than ill terms of
prescribed courses or hours, or points, or anything of the
kind.

The institution of this course under the direction or
Dcan Nollen and Pl'ofessol' Lovell, both oi whom are
prominent educators and believe in this sort or thing.
would lead to a proper orientation of lreshlnell. The
present orientation coul-sc is inadequate and cannot stand
on its own mcri .

Tho lreslimau orientation course will gauge the how
students. It will allow a proper segregation >ol those
who do not ﬁnd themselves compatible with the policy
lrom those who have more ol a luture. At the present
time prolcssors must rely on personal contact and
reaction in judging their students wllo sit in their class
rooms, Whereas a course whore the progress and poten-
tinlilics may ho measured will materially aid in the three
later years oi college liic.

This plan will mean that a system ol comprehensive
examinations will be given over the major and minor
holds. While this may work a hardship on the present
sophomore and junior classes, we believe it will be
superior to the present system tor the classes properly
oricntsd under the new course.

The inauguration of this system will mark another
milestone in Grilmell’s march lorword. The school has
always shown a desire to adopt tlle now and discard
the old. Tile Undergraduate Speaking exchange is an
example of this tendency rolloctcd on the part oi the
students.

We commend President Main on his tar—sighted policy
lor Grinnell and believe that when skilltul advisers come
to know each student, his nsds and ambitions, and aid
him to reach those decisions allccting his career which
will be correct, new life blood will be introduced into the
college. No matter what lactional strife may tend to
mar its unity, Grinnsll will ever pioneer,

PROGRESS.

“Don’t go back; go ahead," were the dying words
ol Captain Robert S. Hunter leading his men against
Sandlllo’s forces in Nicaragua the other day. This
command evinces as much heroism as {he now fiunous
order, “Don't-give up the ship , but in the minds or men
it wont live as long. Some situations ﬁre the imagina-
tion and become heroic with the passing years. others
are but incidents in the constant iorward march.

\Vhen the stately procession of ﬁgures garbled in
acadelllic robes ﬁle slowly on the platform to receive
their diplomas, the situation is going to he romantic, one
that will ﬁre the imagination, one that Will stimulate
with ambition. Then it will be easy to accept the ordcr
oi the dying olliccr "Don't go back, so aheadl" You will
want to go ahead. Relrogression would seem criminal
at that time. -

However, the lanmur of commencement will soon
wear away. A e's job must be undertaken. You
will be the same sari, of a small ﬁsh in a, big puddle when
you sek a position as you were when you came to Grid-
nelI fresh from High schuol conquests.

Tllen it is that the order of the dying hero must be
obeyed. Go ahead! You are having the batteries Di
your brain charged here. Don’t let it deteriorate. Don't
let your enthusiasms and ambition ebb. Rather renew
your determination to live your lite as you vowed on
that Commencement day. “Don‘t go back, go ahead!”

Editor, Scar-let and Black,
Grinnell, Iowa,
Dear Sir:

Before it semester cxalllinalion all
instructor in the Liberal Arts college
at Iowa City made this statement,
“Lot no one be Anxious lest his nelgh»
bor does not do well." That sentence
was direct to the point, vet diplomatic,
and produced the desired cilect. The
Honor System or Student Government
has found a warm l-eluge in the minds
of the leaders of practically every
school. But what is it all about?
Why should we have student govern
merit? What is tlle advantage at the
honor system?

To he plain, the use of the honor.

system in the class room is to cope
"c 'hbing” during examinations. Ono
seriously doubts the usccssity or the
lunction of such a policy in a college
class room, Whether such a system
has been actually adopted or not, in
essence it should exist.
nothing to he gained except the line
mediate value or a higher grade. But
grades are only intangible things and
represent the opinion oi the instructor
or a valuation on his part ol what he
believes you know. Further than that
they have no use, it you are above
the average and cribbcd‘, then for all
practical purposes you are or no more
practical value than the sub-average
student who was bonosc with himself.
The cheater "got by," but lor how
long?

in the light or ollr competitive sys
tem “getting by" no longer plays the
important rule. The man who knows
hiinscll and shows all that is his own
and none others, will finally hrush
aside those who capitalize only ex—
ternal worth. 01' in other words it
is a problem of our own. it the aver-
age is high because oi the presence ol
cheating, the honest man is still as
worthy or himself as the reverse situ-
ation would soon show. It you are
here only to “get by" by hook or
crook. than that is for you to decide.
But we warn you, that you cannot
thus win the game for very long.

No, there is no silent in voting lor
or against an honor system. What-
evsr organization remains at the top,
the individual is still the same. He
lnust (ace the problem himself and de-
cide on a present gain at a luture loss,
or a clean, honest, steady, upward
climb toward success. Honesty to
yourselt isthe key phrase to that type
ol progress. John Canning.
