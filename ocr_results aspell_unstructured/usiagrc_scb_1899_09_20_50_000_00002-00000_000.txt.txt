\lVl: DESIRE to call the special
attention of the students to a nee
trce appearing in another column
of this issue, relative to the exame
ination for admission to the Glee
Club, The value ot membership
in this organization can hardly he
over-estimaled. The club is one
of the most ﬂourishing organiza-
tions oi the college. and with each
year its popularity becomes more
apparent. During the last few
years it has come rapidly into
prominence, and trom a minor
place, has assumed a leading one
in the college world During the
last few years the club has taken
a trip of from six [0 ten days durr
ing the spring vacation, and these
trips, besides being uniiorrniy suc-
cesstul, have furnished a pleasant
outing tor the members. The
management has already taken
steps wrth reference to the trip for
this year, and its success is prac»
tically assured. There are, at
present, six places to be Filled,
two in the ﬁrst tenor,
the second tenor and one in
each of the other trvo parts. The
opportunity for gaining tuemberr
ship is a good one, and one which
ought not to be neglected by any
one who has musical aspirations.
All such are cordially invited to
be present at the examination in
Prof. Cole’s room next Friday
evening.

WE WOULD like to call the die
tention of the new students to the
Athletic Union. Reference to the
handbook will explain the work
of the Union and that it is eom~
pulsory for athletes to belong, but
we wish to urge more than this.
The Union has control of the nth-
letics oi iowa College, uiitler cer
tain supervision oi the tacuity,
and the policy or this part oi col-
lege life is entirely iii its hands.
Every member of the school is
interested in athletics, and in the
proper management of the same,
and should be glad to have a voice
in their management. It is only
through the Union that the man-
agers and members of teams can
come in contact with the support.-
ers oi the teams in order to sub-
mit any new plans. This year
will see many important matters
brought before the Union; not
only important local matters. but
matters relating to our positron in
intercollegiate athletics and we
will need an active and loyal athr
letic Union to dispose of these
questions. The tee is a nominal

one and can be spaied by every
student. For the new students.
the Union offers a means to come
into contact with the athletes oi
the college. and there is no quick-
er way to get in touch with col-
lege lite and our iamous “Grinnell
spirit." What has been said to
new students will apply equally
to some old students who have
neverjoined the Union. it a man
will not join the Union and take
his share oi the responsibilites
necessary to membership, he
should not criticise the work ot
the Union in any particular. He
has a chance to help do this work
and it it is poorly done the great
cr shame is his tor not trying to
improve it by the means in his
reach.

It is with much regret that we
record the resignation ot Prof. J.
Fred Smith. He was not only an
excellent teacher but his moral
miluence in both Academy and
College was strong and made it-
self felt. Prof. Smith's departure
is teit among
the triends of town College as a
distinct loss. An Iowa College
graduate has been elected to oc-
crrpy the position or principal oi
the AcademyiMr. B. E. Powell,
‘92. Following his graduation Mr.
Powell taught in California. He
then studied and traveled three
years in Germany. Mr. Powell s
a young man of ﬁne character and
scholarship and we expect to see
it demonstrated that he is an ex

ceilent man tor the position,

perhaps you have noticed in the

having student leaders in the
