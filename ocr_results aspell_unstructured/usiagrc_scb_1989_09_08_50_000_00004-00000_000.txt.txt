The State Department’s
Deadly Diplomacy in Colombia

By Dan Werner

How does it feel when the front
page in The Des Moines Register
strikes apersonal note? What do you
do when concrete facts tell you tltat
we live undera false democracy, tltat
the mass media is wrong, that the
govemment is lying, that the story
we hear has been manipu-
lated, edited and falsiﬁed in _
order to serve the self-inter
est of those who provide it?

I spent three years in Co- ‘
lombia. When you read the
headlines and names of vic-
tims of the latest violence,
you realize that it's terrible,
but I look at the name and
desperately search my mem,
ory. Do I know him? What
really happened to Luis Car-
los Galan, the leading prestr
dential candidate? Ithink,and
remember....Yes,thechiefof
a Swedish construction firtn
tltat was building a Colomi .

ally mention to me that die United
States was planning on building a
canalthroughnonhemColombiawhon
the Panama canal zone is national-
ized... and things start to fit together
and form a picture which is too terri-
fying to fathom.

The word in the streets of Cali,
Colombia, is that Luis Carlos Galan
wasassassinatedbytheClA.Whether
or not this is the case we will never
know. lim, a friend in California
who quit a high-level position with
the CIA when he realized their im—

morality, told me that every CIA
covert action must be totally deni-
able. No matter what, it did further
promote U.S. interests, on several
fronts.

First of all. Shell Oil owns a mas-
sive, recently discovered oil field in
northeastem Colombia There are
possibly billions of dollars in proﬁts

tied up in this find for Shell. Galan
mentioned nationalizing many Co~

ﬁnanced a coup in Chile. This was
documented during Senate hearings.

to get help in ridding Colombia of

This would not stand out
in my mind were it not for

drugs actually be an attempt
to assure that the Colombian

Forgive and Forget? No Way

By Diane Brumley

Okay, everyone, I’m sorry. I must
be on a “Grinnell is great“ kick or
something. because here I go again,

shift —— wouldn’t you know it? 7 at
the Longhorn restaurant in town, and

happens to be me. So now I‘d like to
share a few things with you on the
subject of the unfortunate attack of a
young woman just outside “the
Horns" two weeks ago, by portray-
ing for you another one of my expe-
riences;working on theTuesdaynight
after the attack.

But before we go strolling down
my lane, I‘djustliketo getone thing
on the record (and here I go again)~
Grinnell is a great little town. When
I was applying to Grinnell College
two years ago, the surrounding comr
munity could boast of its safety and
serenity. Notonce did I hear about or
read of attacks on young college
women the likes that you hear about
at all of the big college universities.
(I‘m glossing over the fact that since
I’ve been here there has been at least
one rape and three reported attacks,
including this most recent one.) But
nevenheless,Grinnell isahappy little
community with a super college
nestled within it.

Okay, so here I am, on the Tues-
day night after the attack. pouring
coffee for my “regulars" (that‘s wait-
ress talk) at the bar.

“Hey. Suzie, you’re back! How
was your summer?" Don’t get con-
fused here~“Suzie” is me. With all
the names they call me — Suzie,
Sweetie, Dixie (where they got that,

I’ll never know), and my personal
favorite, "button nose," l‘m bound to
have an identity crisis one of these
days.

At any rate, we launched into
casual “counter conversation" when

allofa sudden,Mike pops thisoneon
me: “So did you hear about that poor
girl getting attacked outside the front
door hero?"

Excuse me? Our front door? The
one thatl walk out of in ten minutes?
The one with the address 1011 Main
Street above it? The one that is right
here, in my little Disneyalike town
that my readers hear so much about?

“Uh, no, Mike, I didn't hear about
that.” And I think I preferred it that
way, I thought to myself.

But actually, ignorance is never
better. Especially where an issue of
this sort is concerned. I received a
quick recount of how the young
woman had comein forsomething to
eat and had then stayed for a couple
of hours, talking with people she
knew, up until the pointwhen she left
— by herself 7 around 9:30. You

Coca, Killers and Compromise

As President Bush unveils his
revised game plan for “the war on
drugs," a $7.9 billion potpourri, life
at the other end of the coca pipeline
is at least as tempestuous as in
Washington.

The assassination of judge Carlos
ValenciaonAugust16wasfollowed
last week by the murder of Senator
LouisCarlosGalan,adynamicpresi-
dential candidate with a moderate
position against the drug cartels.
Valencia, the 41st Colombian judge
killed since 1980,andGalan.achar-
ismatic and highly popular politi-
cian, are among the many casualties
of a domestic war with very fuzzy
boundaries. The main weapon in the
govemment arsenal is extradition to
the U.S.

The annual costoftheU.S. illegal-
drug crisis is estimated at $100 bil-
lion,of which asizable fraction goes
to Colombian suppliers. (Estimates
of $10 to $40 billion are not uncom-
mon.) Drug production isthoroughly
entangled in the Colombian econ-
omy: the incentives to produce coca
and marijuana as cash crops are

incredible, especially when com-
pared to the meager living to be
made from farming traditional crops.
In addition, many of the so-called
“drug barons" fund local social pror

grams in order to better their public
relations; the $24.5 million in am
nual U.S. aid is a pittance in com-
parison,andcertainlynotastangible
to rural Colombian citizens.

No easy
answers in
Colombia.

American military aid, however,
is quite visible. President Bush au-

thorized emergency military aid of

$65 million over the weekend — aid
to pay for aircraft (including heli-
copters). jeeps. trucks, light arms
and training. Colombian public re-
action to US military aid has been
mixed, a common belief being that
theU.S.has beenlaxindealingwith
drugs at home and has chosen to do
its fighting in another country.

Measures of waning U.S. domes-
tic effons to remedy drug importa-
tion and addiction relief can be seen
in thetwo—thirdsdecreasein funding
for Coast Guard patrols, considered
the most effective arm in the preven—
tion of dmg-smuggling, during the
late Reagan years, and the tworyear
waiting period for public drug-treat- _
mc’nt programs in the District of
Columbia. Horrendous human rights
abuses by the U.S.-supported gov»
emment have detrimentally affected
public perception of the U.S. role in
the country.
