and Man;

in summarizing the uoiuts in rural-
or such a pl'oposi on we ﬁnd:

1. That it provides rcr $6.00 per-
year what costs the average student
$10.00 under- the hresent system.

2. That it would eliunnate the ﬁnali-
cihl dilncultr connected with most or
the outside activities or the college
and would provide a deﬁnite mud to
he relied upon.

3. That it would do nwar with much
ulrllecess‘ .- advertising and othe ex-
house.

‘4. That it would he a beneﬁt socially
in affording every one s'chanee to at-
tend all events and would correspond-

ingly increase the interest and en»

thusiasrn.

5. That it would give the students
a voice in selecting what they wish in
athletic and musical events.

On the other hand someohiections
have heen raised to the nrouos ion as
proposed last year:

1. Thut in reality the lee would he
an increase in the tuitiou'which is
advisable and an increase should he
devoted to the needs of the school rar
“161' than to supporting the So-cﬂllml
outside activities.

2. That it is an unequal sietenr or
taxation. irany studen cannot rill
t'ord or do not care to attend every
college function and it \voultLbe Lax-
ing malty who spend less than on on
per year ion the henent or thoee who
can alrord to sperltl more.

:3 That it would ‘nlaee a linnt on the
etents that could he olfererl and that
this would tend to reduce the qualiti-
rather than raise it.

4, The assumption that all college
activities should he supported by a

tax upon the students as a whole is

wrong,
