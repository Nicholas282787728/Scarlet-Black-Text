Thc_top elevens in the Midwest conference have done amazing—
ly well in concealing their power so far this season. After St. Olaf
was stymied by Grinnell’s unexpected strength, 13.13, it was spec~
ulated by some that the Oles were going to fall short of their
lavish press notices.

‘ Thus, Lawrence's perennial powerhouse, by virtue or a 20—0
Win over Monmouth, was rated the team “most. likely to succeed"
the one as football champs. Then, Saturday's contests again
muddled “11 the picture as St. Olaf came up with a 13-6 victory
over Lawrenae, while Coe overwhelmed the Pioneers, 5240. Carle-
ton, with two straight triumphs, has temporarily emerged on top
of the heap. The Cal-ls were picked 401‘ Sixth in the preseason

where the campus chest is al-
ready in use, they will consult
with local and national figures
connected with united fund
drives, in hope oi determining
the method which can be best
adapted to Grinnell.

Attire end of the year the
committee will select a date on
the social calendar for next year
for the campus chest drive.

“The purpose of the campus
chest", said Dee, “is to eliminate
the numerous. campaigns
throughout the year which ask
for money, and to «enable all the
organizations on campus to work
together on a drive. It would be
definitely advantageous in pro-
viding the college with a uni-
fyiug activity."

Jim Moornead said "This is the
best overall plan that's been
worked out. A united fund drive
will have a better chance in
coming years if this year spent
in planning."

The Student Council voted
last night, at its first meeting
of the year, to increase the price
of Cokes, The council, which
operates the Coke machines on
campus without profit to fin-
ance a scholarship for a Grin-
nell student, decided, after
lengthy discussion, to have the
present machines converted to
accept only dimes. The decision
resulted from a report that the
concession, as now operated is
not meeting the scholarship ape
propriation and maintenance
costs.

Deanof Men H, Brown explained
to the council the administra-
tion: proposal to put distribue
tion or a portion of the semester
tee entirely in student hands. In
past years the sem fee alloca—
tion has passed through the
hands or three groups, the Stu—
dent Council Central Committee.
