THE GRJINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 1936..

 

Prep ’Cagers Lose
to Bullpups, 41-36

Luick Gamers 13 Points
to Lead Grinnell

A ragged Grinnell freshman
quintet lost a hard fought battle
last night to the Drake freshmen.
41-36. The frosh started off with
a bang, dumping in two field goals
to lead 4-0, but the Drake 'fresh-
men came back and piled up a 25-
17 lead at half time,

In the second half, Grinnell came
back strong, and, led by Luick,
who captured high point thonol‘s
for the Pioneers with 13 points,
tossed in seven buckets in the first
four minutes of play, to build up
a 31-27 lead.

From this point the game he-
came a tight, friee-for-oll, with the
lead changing hands several times
until the last few minutes of play,
when the Bullpups came from be-
hind with a flurry of shots and
free throws to put the game on
ice

High scoring honors for the eve-
ning went to Jones. Drake (oi--
ward, who got five baskets and
five free throws for a total of 15
points. Luiok, with six baskets and
a free throw, followed.

Sam Holch, star dash man, hopes
to score first places in the diving
and backstroke events, although
the chances here are none too
bright. Because the squad has lost
so many men, the present small
roster will force all swimmers to
repeat in two or three events.

Lead 11 to 1

With the score four to one in
favor of Grinnell, the Pioneers cut
loose with a terrific scoring drive,
which saw the score mount to
11-1 and then to 13-2, as Bradley
tossed in a long and then a short
shot, followed by McMur-ray's tip-i
in shot and his charity toss. Mc-'
Cloud temporarily stemmed the
Griririell drive by scoring on a free
throw, out Glmllell came back to.

i
follow-in shot. i
Drake got into stride a few scc- ‘
onds later and in turn staged a
brilliant scoring drive to bring the.
margin to 13-10 as Xanders, Par-J
isho, Orehaugh and again Xandcrs,
dropped in buckets in rapid ,suc-
cession.
Dean, LaMlIsney Go in i
At this juncture. Coach Trues-
dale substituted Dean and La-
Masney, but only temporarily liolt-~
ed the Bulldogs, who, after La!
Masricy had made a free throw:
and Dean a short shot, boosted the ‘
score to 16 all, as Parisho, Swan
and Orcbaugh hit the hoop in rap-
id succession. Neither team was
able to stage a concentrated scor-
ing drive, and the half ended 24-
20 in favor of the Bulldogs.
Grlnllell came back with ro-
newed drive in the second half
and after the opening few minutes,
which saw Drake score on a cha
ity toss, brought the score to 24-
as Dean and oriphant dropped in
field goals. A moment later Xan-
ders fouled Olipharit, who tied the
score at 25 all, and then Dean put
Griunell in the lead for the first;
time, 26-25 on Carlson's foul ‘
IaMasney Ties Score
Swan, Drake center, however,‘
tipped in a follow shot to make
27-26, and the Bulldogs were nev~
er headed after this, although Let-‘
Masney tied the game up once
more 27-27 on MCCloud‘S foul.
Parisho dropped in a short shot,-
followcd by Swan’s tip-in and 0rc~
haugh's free throw, and the score
stood 32-27. McMurray made
Grinnell's total 23 on a free throw,
hut Farisho offset this with a. ine-
diuin long shot and a free throw
a moment later. McMurr-ay was
again fouled, and made his shot to
make it 29.
Orchaugh Scores
Orebaugh drove in' for a short

‘ Xander-

scoring effort. Bradley rc-entered
the game and sank a short side
shot to make Grinncll’s total 31
and was fouled as he shot. He
missed his free throw.

Oliphant, a moment later.
dropped in a short sleeper shot as
he sifted behind’ thc Drake guards,
and then McMurray looped in a

uates left to play.

ESPORTﬂ

By Henry Hirsch _
Although Grinnell's basketball
team set no records this year, they
made a far better showrng than
many at the pie-season prognosti-

,cators had guessed. Four wins in
the plenty tough competition that

the Missouri Valley affords is nor'
bad, wlirle the Pioneers should re-
ceive the thanks of both Drake
and Creighton for knocking off
the Aggies twice and thus pre-
vfntlllg the Cowboys from romp-
ing away with undisputed posses-
sion of the top berth.

Tho pioneer preps couldrrt
make it four straight wins for
the season, but they have thrown
hope for a good team next
y or into the hearts of many
Grinnell followers. In Berry, Ln-
iok and Luther, the Pioneers
have three likely prospects, and
these three are supplemented by

 

shot to boost Drake's score to 37,
when Grinnell launched its final

 

a number of other players who

 

are better than avenge. This

year's prep squad, coupled with
LnMasney and Dean of the var-
siry, should produce a winner

for Gn'nnell next year.
x rr a

As yet no hint as to the identi- i
ty of the new football coach has
been given out by the administra-
tion. Rumor has it that a number
of candidates have been chosen.
but apparently there is no founda-
tion to any of the rumors. A very
large number of applications were
received by the authorities, and
they seem to be working over the
list carefully to determine who will
be the best man for the job. A
definite announcement, however,
should be folthcoming in the Very
near future,

rue seniors ended their col»
lege hitskethall careers against
Drake last night. Julie Bauer
has won s letters while in col-
lege, playing as a regular for
three years in both football and
basketball; Rumor has won four
letters; Bradley, four, including
three in‘foothrill and one in has-
kethall; hmiiurray has already
won three, and should add a
fourth in track, although he lms
only attended Gl'iunell for three
years, while Oliphnnt has iron
three basketball G’s.
