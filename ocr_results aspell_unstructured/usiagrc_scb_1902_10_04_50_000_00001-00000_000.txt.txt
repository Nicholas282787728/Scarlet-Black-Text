FOOTBALL.

Small Squad Out—Men are Inexperienced

and LightATime ior New Men to
Get Out is Now,

Football prospects are, to say
the least. not encouraging. Since
the present style oi tootball was
introduced there has never been
a time when things were in worse
condition than now. There are
not enough men out to make a
strong second eleven, There are
no heavy men on either team. The
'Varsity, with only tour ot last
year's team playing, is practically
made up of green men who need
time and experience to develop
into a Strong and consistent team.
The men are doing tairly well tor
beginners and are slowly improv-
ing in speed and team work, but
the development is slow and the
prospect of a hard schedule does
not promise Grinnell much honor
on thegridiron this year. Of the
new men, Dack and Van Liew are
well and Denise is
Marsh

veteran, but is handicapped by

showing up
improving rapidly. is a
being placed in a new position.
Little team work is Shown. The
tnen are slow after the ball is
snapped back and they nearly all
lack that conﬁdence that comes
with experience ot hard games
with all sorts of teams. Many
little points can be gained only
in actual contest and several of the
men have yet to play their ﬁrst
college game. On the other hand
most ottlie teams that Grinnell
must meet this year are made up
of old players or of men who have
had considerable high school ex-
perience. Grinnell will probably
meet but' one team lighter than
her own this year. Drake has a
team made up otheavier men and
men who have had years of foot
ballexperience,andwillliaveevery
chance oi winning a decisive
victory in both her games with
us. Only a Wonderlul brace will
put Grrnnell’s team among the
best in the state this year. New
men may show up well, but nothr
ing can supply the lack oi weight
in the line and the experience
gained in college games.
