5 forgotten ’905 dramas
l. The Ice Storm
Ang Lee's earlier and better take on the suburban situation
that gained acclaim in American Beauty. A difﬁcult ﬁlm, but
, still my pick as the best of the decade,
2. The Sweet Hereuﬁer
featuring a prechohbitlan Holni
doing what he does best,
exposing the tortured inner
souls of characters. A surreal
and beautiful film.
3. Affliction
If there were nothing in this ﬁlm but
Nick Nolte, it would Still make the
list. He deliver; one of the best
dramatic film performances ever.
4. The Thin Red Line
A bold war poem.
5. Sweet E lowdown -
Woody Allen's last really good
movie, largely because it’s
nothing like a Woody Allen
movie, features another
powerful Sean Penn
performance.

_5 films from 5 countries

1. Battleship Patemln’n or October
Two ﬁlms from the Russian master Sergei Eisenstein, perhaps the
last man to truly understand the craft or film—and he died in
. 1943.
2. la Dolce Vita
From Italy, a vibrant
celebration of life,
lust, and debauchery
by director fedeiica
fellini.
3. The Seven Samurai
or The Idiot
/ or course Akiia
kurosawa makes
this list, and either of these films, the action packed historical
epic The Seven Samurai or the breathtakingly beautiful modern
Japanese Dostoyevsky adaptation The Idiot, is a good
introduction.
A. The Seventh Seal '
Simple dark philosophy from Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.
5. Nosjemtu: A Symphony of horror
A silent film, but German never the less. No modern horror or
suspense film would exrst Without the influence of Nosferatu.

These great space horror films were directed, chronologically, by
Ridley Scott, Janie: Cameron, and David
fincher, all of whom are still making

5 forgotten 90’s comedies

1. citizen Ruth
This black comedy from the creators of Election and About Schmidt
proves that an abortion comedy is possible.
2. Everyone Says I Love You
Woody Allen beat Moulm Rouge! to the punch by writing this
light, hysterical musical about the many forms or love. featuring
bad singing and worse dancing, this is one oi few musicals that
sumrves on the merits of its script alone.
3. AS Good As it acts
Jack Nicholson plays Jack, helen Hunt actually acts worth a
damn, Greg Kinneaf gives a wonderful yet overshadowed
performance, and James 1, Brooks crafts a script you'd expect of a
developer of The sinrpsons.
4. chasing Amy ,
veah, 1 don’t think anyone can come to Grinnell without seeing
kevin Smith's seminal Howclo-sleep-wllh>a»leShiah ﬁlm, but man,
Iiust love it too much to not include it.
5. happiness
Writer/director iodd Solondz makes excessively perverse films.
ihis "family comedy" that couldn't get an R rating follows a
pedophile, an overweight »
killer, a crazed Philip
Seymour hoffman, and
the three sisters that
connect them. While
almost black
beyond being
comedic, it
certainly is an
original, fed
up gem.

Spring break doesn’t imply taking a break
from watching movies. Here are some
handy lists of great movies, chosen by
the 8835 film reviewers

5 ﬁlms Jeremy recommends

1. The Bicycle Thief
The most depressing film ever made, but also one or the most
incredibly powerful and memorable. 1 had to mention it
somewhere.
2. Partner
Bertolucci‘taking a oastoyevsky novel, shaking it up with a hit of
Arcaud and a whole lot of cinema. Then things get crazy. Makes a
charlie kaufmann scnpt look as boring as a cookie recipe.
3. Waking Life or Slacker
Watch Richard linklatei movies!
4, it happened one Night
The greatest comedy of all time? I
won’t make that claim, but It is
pretty darn close.
5, Sunset Boulevard and AllAbaut
Eve ‘
both are about washed up
actresses. both are
scathing and
unrelentingly dark. Both
were nominated for
Best Picture in
1950, (If only it
could have been
decided by mud
wrestling!)

5 films Rachel Long
recommends

(B: All the ink my mothers gotten has caused some family
tensian. So please, read my sister Rachel’s choices, for my
health.)

1. showshank Redemption

Its the best movie ever. It can always be watched again. I
probably watch it once a month.

2. Babe: Pig in the City

very dark for a children’s movie: dogs get hanged and the farmer
falls down the well. But somehow they all manage to live happily
enough ever after

3. Before Sunnsc

A romantic comedy for smart people. A Richard linklater film
about an American boy and a french girl who meet on a train and
spend the night wandering around Vienna.

4. But I’m a Cheerleader

A high school cheerleaders friends and family think she’s a
lesbian so they send her off to a conversion camp. Hilarity
ensues.

This movie has something for everyone:

costumes, drama, sporﬁ (if cn'cket is a sport),
