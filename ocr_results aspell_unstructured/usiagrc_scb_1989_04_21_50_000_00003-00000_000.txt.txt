Floating Eagle Feather will entertain the campus
with his stories and poems on Peace Day.

Enlightening stories
from Eagle Feather

by Mike Ellis

Many of the speakers during
Peace Day will challenge you to
take radical steps in order to bring
about peaceful change in the
world. Only one will ask you to
sit back and listen while he tells
stories. His name is Floating
Eagle Feather and he is a story-
teller, Several days ago, he ex-
plained to me how one of his
stories had enlightened one young
mind at a public school that
morning.

“I told a real funny story from
Russia. Afterwards a young boy
came up to me and said ‘Gee, I
didn’t know Russians could
laugh.‘ The young boy realized
that, despite Reagan, Russians
are people, not monsters."

Eagle Feather was born in
Honduras to Mayan parents, but
was raised in New Orleans. He
began to tell stories as a teacher
in order to hold his students’ at~
tentionl After performing at
some festivals in New Orleans he
began receiving invitations to tell
stories around the world. For the
past 14 years, he says, his travels
have taken him to “25 or so
countries" and provided him with
countless tales from diverse cul-
tures. Eagle Feather does not
have his own home but travels
and stays with the people he
meets while telling stories.

Eagle Feather says he tries to
enrich and expand his mind and
become as close to God as
possible. Of course, he says, he

can never expand himself as
much as God has. ”God is in
everything, from the fish in the
river to the dragonﬂies ﬂoating
above the river," he explains, but
he does hope to make himself
”infinite inside a finite body and
mind.”

He plans to divide his Peace
Day performance into three seg-
ments. He’ll begin by paper-
folding: making small animals
out of paper and handing them
out to people. After capturing
his audience‘s attention, he be-
gins his story-telling. The
meaning of his stories is
personal. open to interpretation.
“Each person decides what the
story is to them,“ he says. He
spoke to me of a friend who told
a story to a group of 30 children.
The friend asked the children to
bring back something to her
which represented the meaning of
the story. In response, she
received 30 different items.
Regardless of the interpretation,
says Eagle Feather, “stories
expand the mind and heart.”

Many of his stories, such as
the Russian tale, undermine es-
tablished stereotypes. He re-
minded me in our conversation
not to say Indian but Native
American, because Indian is a
misnomerl “The Europeans in
their conquests never asked the
native peoples what they wanted
to be called,” he points out.

SCARLET AND B

Ethnic food and politics 295

by Marka Peterson

Did you know there is a class
which lets you spend 20 hours
driving cross-country; sample
food from qvery country in the
Middle East; discuss Salman
Rushdie with Arab diplomatic
representatives, and that this class
is even offered for academic
credit? The class is Model Arab
League, and it involves a little
more than sampling ethnic food
and kow-towing with foreign
diplomats.

We, as a class, were assigned
a Middle Eastern country, Libya,
to represent at the Model League
of Arab States the ﬁrst week be
fore spring break . The League is
modeled after the League of Arab
States, a body with 22 member
Arab countries that collectively
passes resolutions on Arab
issues.

Our resolutions had the
sensitive diplomatic task of
trying simultaneously to
represent our own country’s
interests while appearing to be in
the interests of all of the Arab
countries and the Arab League as
a whole.

In case some of you are unc
aware, Libya is a somewhat radi-
cal actor in Arab polities (not to
mention world politics). To give
you an example, last July Libyan
leader Muammar Qaddafi an-
nouncedito a group of sheiks,
kings, and other powerful figures
representing the Arab world that
they were all a bunch of “Western
imperialist lackeys“ because of
their moderate politics. We, of
course, took our cue from this
and thoroughly immersed our
selves in Libyan political ideol~
ogy and Qaddafi’s “Green Book”
of social and political maxims.

At the conference, we were
truly shocked at HOW moderate
and Westem-leaning the thinking
of these so-called “Arab”
countries was! It was surprising
how to all of us as Libyans, and
many of us objectively, that the
other delegates did not even feel
obligated as an Arab country to
pay lip service to many of the
pro—Arab, anti-imperialist
positions Libya asserted. Instead
our Arab brothers committed
and made gross concessions to
gross betrayals of the Arab_cause

Western hegemony. We were,
for example, unable to correct the
corrupted thinking of our
Palestinian brothers, who have
been so weakened and
brainwashe by their Zionist
dictators. and we were unable to
penetrate the Western-infested
minds of the other Arab
representatives’ minds to call for
unified Arab action on Palestine's
behalf

It was not only the political
issues, such as the Palestinian
issue, which produced the only or
the most—heated debate. Each
country‘s view of the world also
had a great effect on the debate
surrounding other issues, such as
the Arab image in the West,
Arab—African relations, or women
in the Arab world Again we as
Libyans, felt alienated and
appalled at the Western nature of
proposed solutions. In Social
and Cultural Committee we HAD
to denounce a plan for Nobel
Prize—type awards for women as
the answer to how to promote
women’s development in the
Arab world, not only because of
its Western connotations but also
as a poor strategy for develop-
ment and one which would,
again, promote individualism and
competition and simply would
not reﬂect Arab value placed on
community. This resolution also
passed, but not before Libya had
had its say and was able to gather
the support of two or three other

countries

Libya‘s presence produced
success on some issues: we
passed our (only) resolution on
the creation of an Arab economic
community to challenge Euro-
pean economic collectivity. and,
because it required a unanimous
vote, Libya and Syria prevented
the rcadminance of the Zionist-
wooing Egyptians into the
League. However, our goal was
not to get our resolutions passed.
Our continuing task, instead, was
to demonstrate to the other
delegates how a very Arab-
centered and anti—Western view
would interpret the issues and the
other eounuies’ stances on the
issues.

It was surprising how com-
pletely submerged many of us
became in our role as Libya
Toward the end of the conference
it became hard to separate fact
from rhetoric and to reason in a
non-Libyan way. But this, I
think, serve the purpose of the
model, supported by the real Arab
League, which was to expose
Westerners to the Arab perspec-
tive on issues, a perspective
which is often under- or unrepre-
sented in a country which never
theless has increasing power and
recognition in Arab polities.

There will be a presentation
by Model Arab League
participants next Wednesday at 9
pm. in Main Lounge.
