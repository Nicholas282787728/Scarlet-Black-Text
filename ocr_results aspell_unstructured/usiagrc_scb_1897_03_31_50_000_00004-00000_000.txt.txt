Greek Play at Beloit.

The latest number of the Rail/id
Tao/r, of Beloit, is devoted to an
account of the presentation oi
“Ipliigenia iii Tauris,” which was
recently presented by classical
sophomores ot the college. The
history or the Greek play at Be-
loitisaiso given. The ﬁrst pre;
sentation wasthat oi the "(Edrpus
Rex,” in 1895, the play being re-
peated in Chicago. Last year the
“Electra,” which was given here
in 1892, was presented at Beloit,
and the success of these two on-
couragcd the continuation ot the
custom, in accordance with which
the "Iphigeiiia" has just been pre
sented. Gi'innell has taken pride
in the tact that the ﬁrst presenta-
tion or a Greek play by any west-
ern scllool was that of the “Elec-
tra” by Grinncll students. The
success or inaugurating this as a
regular cilstoin at Beloit. should
encourage some similar movement
here.

The number of the It’mlizd Tali/z
was extremely creditable, the ar-
ticle being fully illustrated from
photographs.

Yale Defeats Harvardi

Yale defeated Harvard last Fris
day evening, at Saunders Theater,
Cambridge, in the annual debate.
The subject debated was, “Re
solved, that the United States
should adopt deﬁnitely the single
gold standard, and should decline
to enter a bimetallic league, even
it Great Britain, France and Ger-
many should be willing to enter
such a league.“ Harvard, on the
afﬁrmative side. was given the
burden oi prooi.

The Harvard speakers were:
S. R. Wriglitintzton. '97: Gold-
thwaite H. Dorr, ’97; and Fletcher
Dobyns. ’98, with w. H. Conroy
as alternate. The Yale speakels

were: CharlesS. MacFai-land. '97; ' ’ '

Charles U. Clark, ’97; and Charles
H Studinski, ’97, with E. H.
Hume, '97, and P. H. Gar-van. '97.
as alternates.

 

The main discussion was con-
cerning the exact meaning or the
question. Harvard contended
that it was simply a question of
adopting a deﬁnite gold standard;
Yale argued that it was a question
as to whether the present admiri-
istration should adopt the single
gold standard.

At the conclusion of the debate
the judges, Professor D. R. Dew~
ey of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Professor H, F.
Giddings oi Columbia, and judge
E A. Aldrich olthe United States
Circuit Cour-t, after a prolonged
consultation, announced their de
cision in favor of Yale.

Atter the debate a dinner was
given to the judges and debaters
at the Colonial Club.#£:r.

Lchigh University has been
having a reconsideration of its
honor system. Complaints were
made that the system had not bccn
wotking well, so tor this reason
amass meeting at the students
was called by the president. The
president and one of the leading
professors expressed themselves
as in favor of it, but it seems that
the students have lost interest in
it and need to be aroused to closer
attention in regard to it.

A new illustrated monthly mags
azine entitled TIM College Alb/em,
will appear April it. devoted to
athletics in colleges and prepare
tory schools. Chase, Hickok,
Orton, Cross, Shaw and others
will contribute.
