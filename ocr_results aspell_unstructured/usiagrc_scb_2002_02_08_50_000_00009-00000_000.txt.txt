UN EPA VIOLATIONS:

"Boise Cascade, like other
manufacturing companies,
from time to time receives al-
legations of violations from
the EPA, These allegations are
often resolved through provid-
ing additional information and
are not pursued further. Boise
Cascade resolves all EPA or
state allegations of violations
in a timely manner We take a
very cooperative approach
with agencies on this matter,”

“One of RAN's tactics is to use
false information to recruit

Underhanded tactics alleged

Since RAN launched its campaign against Boisc Cascade
in 2000, the two sides have engaged in a consianiiy escalat-
ing battle in which each tries to prove the otlrc ' tactics nrorc
reprehensible. The most recent salvo crime in ing, when
the conservative group b‘ronuersofFrtcdoni tried to get RAN's

0N BOISE (ASEADE:

"Boise Cascade has a history
of controversial logging opera.
tions, as do many multina-
tional logging companies A
close examination of Boise
Cascade's global operations,
however, reveals a pattern of
aggressive exploitation and
unethical business practices
that sets Boise Cascade apart
from others in its industry.
Boise Cascade has been
dubbed by many as ‘America‘s
worst logging Company,’ a
company unwilling to adapt to
modern social values."

“RAN has not done a lot of the things that [Boise] has
said they've done," Hayward added, “At least rhat's what RAN
says."

RAN accuses Boise Crucadc ofhiding behind third par.
ties like Frontiers of Freedom in an effort to covertly hurt
RAN’: finances.

Frontiers of Freedom, winch the WI 517!” journal de-
scribed as “hacked by tobacco and oil companies." claimed
that Ms :Icuons were more political than educational and
asked thc ms to reclassify the or-
gammtion as an advocacy group.

RAN is currently classified as a
nonprofit organization, and at
such. all donations to it are taxrdcr
ducnble,

Boisc cascade says it has no
connection to Frontiers oft-‘rccdoin
or a related group, the center for
the Dcfcnse of Free Enterprise
(CDFE). which operates the anti»
RAN wcbsnc wwrurrrnrnnrc/r.org

RAN't website says that CDFE
was “founded by Boise Cascadeand
others." but Boise denies any such
connection. “we are aware ofrhcsc
two organizations, but we do not belong to either," Moscr
said, “and we’ve played no role whatsoever in the group's chub
lengc to RAN’s [RS tax status."

“lfyou are looking for .r smoking gun letter connecting
Boise Cascade with the IRS attacks, there is irot one," coir
ccdt-d Stephan, However, “our claims are also supported
by tho umrng ofrhe attacks, which came about one ycar after
RAN larrnchcd a campaign against [Boise Cascadci."
