Honor System

or late there has been much debate as to
the practicability and desirability of the Hons
or System on the Griiinell campus. In order
for the system to succeed, the students must
be convinced of its desirability. The nature
of the System itself makes this cimr. Our
plan is to set forth simply and concisely the
points on which we base our belief that the
System is a good thing.

A good many of us have had experience
with a reginiented society. Naturally, enough,
we are in various degrees of reaction to this
experience. We desire, and rightly so, a higher
measure of self-determination. The Honor Sys-
tem run by students is the only instance of
genuine freedom on the Grinnell campusiit
proffers us the opportunity to rule ourselves,
If this freedom is handled intelligently, there
is no good reason to believe that it will not
be followed by richer, more significant chances
at self-government.

This present freedom and the ones which
may well follow, are more than a mere sur-
eease of restriction. They have an intrincic
value They make possible a salutary intellec-
tual and moral climate in which to do the
creative work of a college campus.

We believe that the opposition to the Hone
or System arises from rtwo basic shorteomi gs
in critical insight. The first is in the failure
to understand the full implications of the con-
cept of sportsmanshlpitlle idea that it is not
sporting to report one of your colleagues for
an infraction of the Honor pledge. The Amer-
ican term sportsmanship as we understand it
is based in the main on three points: first,
that a sportsman is as good as his word; sec-
ond, that he will not pride himself in a VIC~
wry too easily Won; and third that he doesn’t
put on his friends a burden which he refuses
to bear himself. The man who cheats in an
unpi-octored examination breaks his wordg
”shoots a sitting duck"~lays an incubus on
the conscience of his classinates, and en-
croaches on the freedom of the entire student
body.

Th second gap in the thinking of the 0p-
ponent of the Honor System is his inability to
appreciate the integral part which the SysA
tem plays in the over-all ideal of a college
such as Grinnell, This college bases its curricu-
lar and activities on a belief in the responsi—
bility of the individual, and on a belief that
the mission of Iiberalizing‘gfreeinggthe indi-
vidual is a worthy one. Such an ideal will not
stand or fall with the reaction of the student
to the Honor System. but certainly the resul-
tant attitude will test the belief of our college
generation in its essential worth,

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

in Lansing, Michigan have organized the
LDVVTGTRMB club. We should like to pro-
pose that the veteran students of Grinnell col-
lege unite and organize the IDWTGTBMH
club, with special auxiliary branches WWPR
and WTHCVVMI. The main function of this
organization would be to further government
interest in Grinnell. Special branch WWPR
would be concerned with checking on the ef»
ficicncy and quality of results, while WTHC-
WMI would make sure that the interest was
shown in a hurry. Little questions such as,
“How much space will be allotted for diaper
hanging?" and “Do we use the women‘s gym
or Darby for house parties Y" might be
handled by the club in general. The chief
question before the new-made brotherhood,
however, will probablybe “Towhom dowe subs
nut the constitution for our club? Is this a
matter for a. commanderein-chief or for a
lieutenant colonel?"

There has been remarkably little griping on
the part of the vets. And workmen, to be sure,
have been appearing every daymwell, almost
every day—lo swarm busily around their little _
heaps of lumber and bricks. Yet we can not
help recalling the plaintive enthusiasm of one
veteran who maintained, “I'd rather live in a
mud house in Grinnell than in a castle any-
where else." Brother, you may get your wish.

How does the Word honor tie

Kup with the examination system

as is now described in the con-
stitution? It seems to me to be
based more on dishonor than the
intended opposite. When we are
told to take every other seat in
every other row there is no long-
er any element of honor involved.

If we are going to have an
honor system why not have a
program based on principles such
as the name implies? Why not

Let us do away with stipula-
tions and qualifications. Dispense
with the court, abolish seating
rules, and let each individual
watch only himself.
