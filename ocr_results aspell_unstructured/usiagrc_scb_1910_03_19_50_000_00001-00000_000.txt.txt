Drake at Ames (3 to 0), and Grinnell
at Grinnell (2 to 1). Drake won second
place, deteatrng G nueil at Des Iloines
2 to 1, The question for debate was:
“Resolved; That Congress should En-
act An Incoure Tax Law. Constition-
ality Conceded,"

The Grinnell-Ames debate was held
in Herrick Chapel last night. ames
received the decision on account or a
stronger and more thoroughly worked
case. and a more adequate presenta-
troo, E s. Turner-fol. C. \ratson, and
J. A. Wilson supported the aflirrnative
for Grlnuell; R. C. Palmer, A. F. Lune
gren and T. H. McCall delended the
negative for Ames.

The a-gunrents presented
follows:

were as

Affirmative.

All income tax is needed to make
up the present deﬁcits, nreet current
expenses and provide for the erpanr
sion of the futilie: to make our taxing
system elastic, so that it will 'pand in
emergency anii then contrac , to make
our supply or revenue available.

The consumer says the tnriit’ and ill-

An income tax is objectionable a-,

Agreed with Mr. Fitch in saying that
to-education breaks down cilivnlry, he
stated that the willingness at certain
mule “ol’leudors” against the dancing

tradition to let the women take all lhe‘

blame appeared to bear out such a has
lief.

Concerning the idea that to be
"called up" before him in this matter
of dancing meant nothing, Mr. Main
said that such a proceeding (lid mean a‘
great deal. “Practically all i have
talked with in this way," he said, “do
three things: First, acknowledge that
they have violated a college tradition;
set ntl, admit their vital relationship
to this tradition; and, thi d, give as-
rurmlcc o/ future cooperation in the

proper remedy suggested through Kip-

Pr dent Main remarked that rer-

The income tax is practicable. it

by all the leading powers or Europe.

Negative.

There is no fiscal need. Revenues

result in multiplicity of taxation and
