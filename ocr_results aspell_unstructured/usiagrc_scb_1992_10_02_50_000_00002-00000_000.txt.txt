This will be the new computational chemistry laboratory.

Chem builds new lab

The Grinnell College chemistry
department has been awarded a
$29,000 giant from the National Sci—
ence Foundation to partially fund
a new computing laboratory

This grant is pan of the NSF‘s
Instrumentation and Laboratory Im-
provement Program. This summer,
the college received additional sup-
port for the new lab from the Carver
Foundation in Muscat'tner

The grant allows the college to

build a computational-chemistry/
molecular modeling laboratory aspart
of the current science building reno-
vation. The college expects that the
new lab will be ready for use next
semester.

LutherErickson, chairman of the
chemistry department and project
director for the grant, said that the lab
will be used by students in upper-
level chemistry courses to perform
sophisticated calculations which will

make them better able to understand
the structure and other properties of
molecules, The equipment will then
be used to display and manipulate
three-dimensional models of mole
ecules.

This is the latest in a series of
improvements to science building
facilities. More renovations will
continue throughout next summer.

SGA tries to improve
campus-town relations

by T sha Howell

In the past. town/gown relations
at Grinnell have been less than ideal
at timmr Misunderstandings and lack
of communication have fueled the
problem. Butnow, the SGA is work-
ing with the town of Grinnell to imr
prove relations and eliminate the
problems of the past.

Angela Onwuachi, president of
the SGA, stated that mere had been a
build-up of small problemsover time
that led to thecurrent situation. When
this year’s cabinet was activated, a
meeting between the SGA and Main
Street Grinnell was held to identify
the problems and to decide whatcould
be done.

One big problem has been lack
of communication between the cola
lege and the town. For example,
Grinnell townspeople were relying

on the Pennysaver to communicate
with the college students. Until this
meeting, it was not realized that the
Pennysaver was not being distrib-
uted on the campus. Also, while
many on-campus events are open to
the town, this simply isn’tadvenised
enough in Grinnell. “These were
simpleproblems we could solve eas
ily,” stated Kendra Loose. SGA’s all
campus events programmer,

Another problem which is not
quite so easily solved is the stereo-
types held by both groups Onwuachi
attributed this partly to a lack of re-
spect for each otherr Also, college
students have generally remained
separate from the town, leaving both
groups to wondcrjust what the others
are really like.

“SGA has really made an effort
to breach 6th Avenue," said Loose,
referring to the social events planned
to mis students with townspeople.

Town presence on campus as well as
studentpresence in town is hoped to
increase Students will be helping
with the laycees haunted house, and
other events being considered are a
pumpkin contest, participation in the
high school’s homecoming parade,
andahighschool/college casino night
The high school’sstudentcouncil has
been particularly helpful in the tenta»
tive planning of these last three events
Local businesses are also anx-
ious to increase student presence in
town. Loose hopes to organize a sale
in town for college students in order
for them to become more acquainted
with the stores and "really take ad
vantage of living in a small town.”
The town has been very support-
ive of the SGA’s efforts thus far.
There is hope from both sides that
theseeffortswillcrealcapen'nancntly
positive town/gown relationship.

Escorts now on call
—S GA answers need

by Howard Horn

In order to try to calm thc fears
of students who have to travel alone
atnlghlon campus,th Sludcanov-
cmmcnt Association will soon be
operating an escort service.

The new service will be operat-
ing from a post inside the Coffee
house. Students can contact a dts-
patcher by calling 26973111. The
dispatcher Willconlactan escortwith
a walkyrtalky. The escort wtll pick
up the student in a golfcztrtand drive
them to their destination. Times for
the program will be Sunday through
Thursday from 10 pm, to 1 pm. and
Friday and Saturday from to pm. to
2 pm.

An escort scrvicc was planned
ln response to what SGA had heard
from students about campus sufcty.
Many people, especially women, are
uncomfortable walking alone on
campus at nlghti SGA Presrdcnt
Angela Onwuachi, the person who
has done mostoflhe workbehind the
project and a student who often must
make long trips at night on campus.
said, “I often feel uncomfortable
myselfr"

SGA hired 20 people to act as
escons. One of the criteria to get a

jobasnncscortwas matthe person be
trustworthy. Onwuachi said lhatSGA
based the hiring of students on how
comfortable Ihey would be traveling
wiLh this person at night. She be-
lievcs she has found pcoplc With
whom students will feel safe. Ac-
cordingtohcr,“Youshouldfcclcomr

will feel more comfortable."

Response to the service on cam
pus has been mixed. Sophomore
Norah Scnnlttn feels, “it’s a good
ldca. lfl don’t feel safe, I know I
can call it." Scanlan also thinks that
it is ridiculous that they don’t have a
system like lt yet.

similarly. “I think it’s good,” she
said. “Itshowspcrspectivcsandother
people that the campus really about

safety on campus ls not something I
am worried about.”

Adelberg helps solve
ancient math mystery

Grinnell College math profes—
sor Arnold Adelberg has solved pan
of a math problem that scholars have
worked on for more than two centu-
n'cs.

Adelberg recently published a
research announcment entitled “Ir-
reducible factors and p-adic poles of
higher orderBemoullipolynomials”
in the August issue of Comptes
Rendus Academy of Science of
Canada.

In the announcement, Adelberg
outlines apaper which will appear in
Acta Arithmeticu,al>olish mathemat-
ics journal, one of the most preSLir
gious number theory journals in the
world. This publication is the culmi-
nation of a long-standing project in

which Adelberg answers many sign
nificantquestionsabouttheBemoulli
polynomials, which have been inves-
tigated intensely for several hundred
years.

These polynomials are very im»
portant are a very important mathr
ematicalsequenceespeciallyincone
nectionwithFermat’sLastTheorem.
They appear in Combinatorics and
many other fields.

Adelberg has made recent pre»
senlations on these polynomials to
the Iowa section of the Mathematical
AssiciationofAmericain DesMoittes
and at the national meeting of Ihe
American Mathematical Society in
Baltimore.

andaclive in combating incidents ofsexual
harassment,

Another student blamed Student Al'-
fairs {or not acting responsibly in u case
that seemsa bit shaky.The charges, as The
Scarlet and Blackrcportcd Sanchez's perr
CepLion of them, did not seem, to this
student. serious enough to merit such tira-
mstic dismissal and subsequent locking of
French house. The student explained that
not leaving a room when asked lo did not
seem like a serious enough offence to
require dismissal. The student dismissed
the alcohol charges by citing thar Sanchez
was 28 and fully legal to comsumc alco-
hol, As for drug use the student said that if
everyone nn campus who used drugs was

dismissm the college’s population would
be considerably reduced.

Students are discussing the question
oi the harassment charge more than the
chargES of alcohol and drug use as being
key in Sanchcz‘s dismissal. Without any
word on the ofﬁcial reason for Sunchcz's
dismissal it is impossible to prevent the
speculation. Grinnell students will con-
tinue to wonder what happened in the
Sanchez case. But an employee's records
are conﬁdential and the Administration
says it cannoL legally, make Sanchez's
record public.

Sanchez left the country Thursday
afternoon. He is returning m his home in
the Pyrenees and will enroll in University
to complere his Masters this year. Anyone
