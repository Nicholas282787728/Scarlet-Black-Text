position immediately became the
center of campus controversy, and

the strong support or the student

There the flag remained until Nov

John And Nina: Evexpresent RA’ 5

by Lynn voedisch

John and Nina Adams do not keep
their presence secret; anyone iamil»
iar with Younker Hall is familiar
with the bright open door policy
that the new Younker resident ade
visors hold. The RA’s keep a bright
and inviting apartment filled with
constant music, plants and congenial
people.

Serving as “friends, therapists and
sometimes Mom and Dad.” John
and Nina see their main respon-
slbility as one or presence,

“If i had to Sum up the duties
of RA's I would put it in two words,
‘Ee there,’ ” says Nina John and
Nina agree that whatever an RA
really is, depends on the students.

Becoming resident advisors began
in Hyde Park,wherethe Adamswere
living prior to this August 15. John
received information about the ad-
visor program through tlyers cire
culated at placement ofﬁces, The
selection process for advisors ens
tailed many interview sessions, one
in Chicago and a iew more in Grin—
nell Interviewers included a stu-
dent panel, the Dean oI Students,
and a chaplain.

ched as closely as possible with
the residents of the individual
dorms. Nina explained that at one
time a “jock dorm and a freak
dorm" existed and the athletic or
hip—type advisors were placed rese
pectively Younker was once the site
oi a 1968 experiemental caved dorm

married RA’S. John and Nina arethe
only married advisors on campus.

with the administration, especially
such members as the Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs. Conney Kimbo, but
