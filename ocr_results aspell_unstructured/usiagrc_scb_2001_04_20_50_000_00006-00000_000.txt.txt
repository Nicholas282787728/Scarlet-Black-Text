Initiative Proposal: Modify the current
college judicial system to limit the role
of the Judicial Council

Backgrou nd

1n the full SCHICSKCI’ of 2000, the Judicial
Council chargoolsoerai oflny {trends and me
with croaring a culture otdoviancc that en.
gmdt-tcd [IK‘ now infamous Wafflcgale inci-
dent. Althouin ihc student judicial process
purports to be nonadvcisanai, we found rho
process to be iuirair. in a ridiculous tutti or
events, we dISCOVCK‘d Il'mi thcjudiclal Cuunr
cll is: Kanptoo Court whctc dcftndnnzs hav:
little chance ofarquiltal without [hrcalcnlng
a law suit to important administrators. For-
tunately, rho council dropped these charges
when do administration told it to stay out of
cultural matters However, this only occurred
after w: threatencd to sue the mllcgc. The
problcins with the judicial Council are nut
nicrous, First, all proceedings are closed, so
the Council it not tcsponsible to the campus
community for the docisions that it males.
secondly. tho peopio who charga thc deicnt
dants also present tho case against them, In
turn, thosc same people also determine the
guilt orthc defendants and dotcrminc what
their punishment will be. Thus, iudCoscrvcs
as police, prosecutor, iudgc, jury, and execut
tioncr. Nominally, they have dtc SGA vico
President prosont die cast, but the members
of the Council decide which studcnts at:
charged with what Thiidly, the Judicial
Council mils defendants that Jen Kmhn will
advise you on how to deal with the hearing.
However, thoy don't [(11 you that the contents
orany email. phone contact, or convcrsation
you have with Ms. Ktohn Will he forwarded
to thdudicial Council. This is outrageous I

action with thejudicial Council and may not

in the interest orthe studtnt body and the
college that the yudieial system be fair, I wish
that I had known about these problems bc.
tarc my cxpetiencc with yustico )udesrylc,
but now I feel an obligation to help zmcllt)»
rate the problems with this system. i dont
beliovc that thccurrcnrsystcm is part orsomo
sinister plot to hoop me down, but i won‘t
rule out diat possibility. i just belicvo that
die College‘s judicial system would be more
just ii the changos that i suggest could be
implemented.

The Initiative

Evm though most studcnts do not have
to dcal with the Judicial Council, we believe
that the Coliogc Judicial system should bo fair
to those accuscd oiviolations of the Code of
Conduct. The judicial Council should not
investig the violation, bring dic chargcs.
and then judge guilt or innoccnce; this pro.
ocss is unfair to the accuscd,

Plan of Action

The Judicial Council should not be able
to charge students widi violations otthe code
ofwnduct. irno onc in the campus com.
munity wants to charge someone with a VIO-
lation, data this person should norbo chargcd.

The person who charges the defendant
should present the complaint. The Judicial
Council should not form tlitsGAvicc Fruit
dam to present rhcir case The actual corn.
plainant should present the case.

lra membcr of the Judicial Council
would like to present a complaint, that mcm~
bcr should not sit on the council during the
proceedings. They should pros-uni tho case
and not yudgc guilt or innocence.

All contact with ]:n Krohn (tho advisor
to ludCo) should be confidential. Slit-should
not be able to tell tho Judicial Council any-
thing that tho dcrcndant says or does.

initiative Proposal: Delay mandatory
laptop implementation one year for
review

Background

Grinncll’s Information Technology Ser-
vices (ITS) developed a Information'l'tdnioi
my Priority Projects List, proposing the adop»
tion ota single platform, single model. inan—
datory laptop requirement. on rheirwebsito,
ITS writcs, “establishing a requirement to
student ownoiship ufot access to astandard
laptop computer is thc single most impor.
tant first step toward acincvmg the strategic
technology goals ordic College," The Stu»
dent Academic Computing Committee
(SACC) has identiﬁed several problems widt
these proposals. To wit

l A mandatory laptop roquiroinent
would cost each student thousands oidollars
in increased comprehcnsivc lots. with In»
ition rotendy rising by about 32 000, Grinntll
students have already been hit hard; another
increase would put financial strain upon many
more. In addition, Citinnell will attract pnt
manly students {tom the wealthiest back-
grounds it it raises fees excessively hurting
college diversity,

2. Mandatory computers oliminate
choice. Grinnellstudcnrscan maltodccisions
for themselves—students who want laptops
can buy laptops. diosc who want desktop
computers can buy them, and students who
prefer to save then money and use the com.
putor labs tan do so easily,

3.Th: proposed changes would not close
the largely imaginary “digital dividc" that lTs
secs on dais campus. These proposals would
drive away potential students who cannot
alTord to lease laptops. In addition, ditto are
many computers in the computer labs; therc
is no digital dividc to ﬁx because evcry stu-
dcnt at Grinncll has easy computer acoess. t

This initiativ: wtll s:rv: as feedback [0
lTS by reporting the quantity otsrudonrs in-
retested in seeing tho implementation otman
datory laptops reconsidered.

The InitiaIive

Wham: the student body feels that ITS
has been hasty and otclusivo in its manila
tory laptop proposals;

Whereas sh: student body feel: its cons
terns have not boon adequately tonsidorod
in this matter;

Therefore, wc the trudcnt body toquesr
and rt'qulrt

l.That crinncll implement no manda.
tory laptop proposal sooner than fall 2003;

2 That in the course otthis addod time,
those administrators responsible for theoriglc
rial proposals mvicw and revise it in public
sessions, speciﬁcally inviting members or the
studcnt body and Faculty,

3.Thatifthiscommitrocclecrs to go forth
with the proposds or a variation on thcm,
bodins representing the students. faculty, and
stairapproveitberorcimplcmentationbrgins.

Plan of Action

The ﬁrst stated roouircmenr or this i
turn: is that laptops not be mandatory be.
fort- fall of2003. scoond,1Ts and its uppcre
icvcl administrators are to convone a sorios of
wolbannouncad public stssions in which to
reconsider the mandatory laptop proposals
in light of comments from students, begin.
ning with those listed as background to dns
initiative, and continents from student otgn»
nivations llchGA and SACC During this
review, members ottho faculty and student
body would bc invited to mmmt-nt on the
proposals. and to suggest viable alternativts.
This process would catty on until a collscn»
sus was rcachcd. at which point bodies repre-
senting the studcnu. acuity and start would
approve the final version betoro lTs bogan to
considcr implementation,

The Skinny from an Insider

Assassination games in recent insumtional memorywerc
run by Philip Allen '00. He ran two games in spring ‘98.

and one each in Fall and spring '98-
‘99, There was no game last year. The
current game is by far the largest.
Whercus previous games may hav: had
up to 45 players, the current game has
nearly so dead already. with others still
alive Also. in rho past, the ante was $1
to play. i changed it to $2 to swccten
{he pot for the winner My wony was
(is) that this makes some players focus
inoro on the moncy, but i rhinit that‘s
outweighed by the sheer scale of the
game, which has been really exciting.
