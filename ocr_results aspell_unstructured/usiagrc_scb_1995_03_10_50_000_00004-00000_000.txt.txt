HUM Productions is in die process
of legally eslablishing themselves as a

ment. but we will also be a record label,"
said Kropa

“It‘savision I’vehad forayearnow
and it just started coming together,"
ZJabinger said.

The artists will pay for the record-
ing daemselves and HUM will pay for
the duplication andptomolion oftheCD.

“Williall my skills in being amusi-
cian myself, having been a promoter
running things likeAlt'cc in Wonderland

and the Battle oft/la Bands, and working
tvitlr people on tr big scale. [it] really
made niei‘ealimiwow—Icould do all
this in the music world." said Zlablligcr.

After graduation, Kropa plans to
take care of a lot of the business issues
by keeping track of accounts, promOA

Chapman distant from audience

By ANDY HICKEN

Arts Columnist _
CY Chapman is a wonderful

songwriter and musician.

Herband appears to have worked

very hard to reach a phenomenal level of
tightness.

But for me, her show at Harris on

Saturday raised the question of why

 

we have live music. My going theory
is that it exists for three reasons: so we
can see the performer in person, so we
can gain some new insight into the
music,a.ndsowccarl haveagoodume,

How good of a decision it was to
askthecrowd to sitdown,asChapman
did? Obviously, the constraints of
Harris were once again a problem: the
place doesn't have a terraced ﬂoor.
likeitshould,loalloweveryoneto see,
and Chapman had to make a choice
between unobstructed lines of sight
and dancing. And for some people, the
ﬁrst option is probably the more ape
pealing one, but I think much of the
audience would have sacriﬁced thatin
order to express themselves in a less
static way than clapping.

And what ofher band’s religious
Ie~Cieatl0n of her album sound? It
wasn’tbad, perse—afterall,lrstenrng
to 3 Tracy Chapman album is enjoy
able. IfChapman is sirivin gfor perfect

replication of her CD's, then why
doesn’t shejust take the ﬁnal step and
lipsynch? Or why don‘t we just stay
home and listen to the albums?
Chapman seemed at times to want to
keep the audience at arm’s length, as if
she were afraid of sharing too much of
the meaning behind her music. So she
fell back on the excuse of executing a
triumph of live sound engineeringi
impressive, I guess. as a display of
technical ability, but not really adding
anything to her songs

So, for me, the best pans of the
show were during the middle, when
she jettisoned her band and played
solo, and the points when she intro-
duced some of her greatnew stuff, and
during the encore, when the crowd
stood up and the band played a couple
bluesy songs. Those pans uftlic show
were amazing, and showed that Tracy
Chapman could eventually be as good
a live performer as she is a songwriter,
if shejusl loosened up a little,

important part was to organize a come
