Element,

Susan Sidlowski squinted through the
dust-streaked windows as the bus pulled
into San Agustin. “God, it’s the armpit of
Colombia,” Dave said, craning his neck to
see out past her. ”I’ll bet they don't even
have a taxi!" The buildings moved past,
most of them with white fronts and jagged
cracks straining up the walls from their
mudsplattered bases. The passing of
horse-drawn vehicles had cast the grime
from the mad about three feet up the
walls, Crumbling red tile roofs, small win-
dows with coarse shutters of unfinished
wood, and mismatched steps of various
heights added to the effect. This was a sim-
ple, rural town, nothing more.

“It feels comfortable" thought Susan,
“I like it Maybe hell be here ”

They climbed off the bus. Dave headed
inside to ask for directions while Susan
stood under the greying skies and racing
clouds to take stock of her surroundings,
The bus ‘emptied, The rest of the
passengers had gone in various directions
and the bus driver had gone around the
corner of the building to relieve himself
when Dave came back out. “Hotel's that
way," he pointed. “Guess who was right
about the taxi?"

'The sky threatened to pour rain down on
them. Dave and Susan trudged alongside
the dirt road on the right, each with a
weighty, overrthershoulder bag. Disorders
ly ranks of leafy trees with droopy fronds
crowded both sides of the road, and the
wild grass growing in clumps here and
there came right up to the edge of it. Susan
pointed out a group of banana trees, their
branches sagging under the weight of the
ripening clusters of fruit. Dave nodded
disinterestedly. His feet hurt.

After a while, a flatbed trailer pulled by
two horses caught up to them. Susan flagg-
ed it down and asked the driver in halting
Spanish how much further the hotel was,

”Dos, tres kilometros. No se.” The olive-
skinned driver shrugged his shoulders

’ beneath the wide-brimmed hat shading the
back of his leathery neck and offered them
a ride. Dave mumbled to himself
something about “the state of transporta
tion in this Gndforsaken corner of the

world and jumped on, while Susan climbed
up next to the driver. She asked him about
his family. He told her about his wife and
seven Children, that his two oldest sons had
been pressed into military service by the
government, and how much they were
needed to help him work the farm. He had
bought a new blade for his plow and come
plained about the risein price from the last
time he had bought one. Susan nodded
pleasantly and smiled throughout the ride,
catching only bits and pieces of his bare
rage of quickrtongued Spanish. Dave
dangled his legs off the back and looked de-
jected. He wished he was in New York, The
horses clipclopped along.

After the Pedro let them off in front of
the hotel, Susan thanked him and tried to
slip a couple of small bills in his hand
which he refused by tipping his hat. He
caught up the reins and waved goodbye.
The hotel, with a sloping, Spanish-style tile
roof and a large veranda out front, was set
back in a grove of exotic-looking trees with
corkscrew branches and small, spade-
snaped leaves.The two Americans walked
into the lobby, Signed for a room at the
desk, and went to bed.

That night Susan dreamed about her
husband, Will Sidlowski. He had worked as
an engineer for an Americanrowrled oil
company called Colombian Mud A small
corps of company men, including will,
were on a project in the jungle about I50
miles north of Lemon, a small town on the
shore of the Amazon at the southernmost
tip of Colombia indians made a raid on
their camp and will somehow disappeared
in the confusion.

The company's head office wouldn't tell
Susan anything substantial. After several
months of expecting news, Susan forgot
aboutsitting back and waiting and took the
initiative When she began pulling strings
and shaking down people, even the come
pany bigwigs, she discovered that they in
fact knew just as much as she did
Nothing.

Her decision was to investigate Will‘s
unexplainable, disappearance herself.
With financial backing from Colombian
Mud, Susan followed an erratic trail ac-

View from the Outside

by Paul Draus

In the town where I grew up and where I
live when I’m not here, there is a woman
named Mary. Now Mary is a large lady, to
say the least, and her bulk does not make
her any less conspicious when she sits on
street corners and watches traffic go by.
She must be quite an interesting sight for
motorists passing by on State Street, on
their way to or from Chicago or wherever
they are going to or coming from. I im-
agine she has turned quite a few heads in
her day, sitting alone on that bench, her
helty frame wrapped in layers of multi»
colored mismatched dresses, shopping
bag dangling at the end of her dough-like
arms, bra strap digging a deep valley in
the ﬂeshy folds of her shoulder. painted

‘...but it‘s that
mouth; that

lips movtng.

That’s the thing that holds the most
looks, I think: Mary's constantly moving
lips, Her size and awkward appearance
may turn heads, but it's that mouth, that
flexible red orifice which ﬂoats above her
piled-up chins, never resting, talking on
and on, which makes people stare. Mary is
always talking, but not many people hear
what she s saying They don t even know
whom she s talking to. Only Maly knows
that

I remember the first time I saw Mary, I
was in thirdpr fourth grade, and [was out
on the playground during recess with the
restof my classmates. One of them spotted
Mary waddling across the school yard and
said, “Look, it‘s Crazy Mary.” and then he

Tr‘ue confessions

by Rebecca Foley ‘ ,

Last week, I decided to join a couple of
my friends and go on a con? trip to ski at
Fun Valley. It would be fun, Ithought eh;
thusiastically. Little did I know of the hor-
rors I would fl

As we were nearing the lodge, my im-
agination, never one to stay aground,
soared to new heights (note my mountain
metaphors) I could see myself on the
slopes, all decked out in ski~type clothing:
a female James Bond, speeding down the
mountain, whipping in and out among the
trees along thepath, the bad guys fading
fast behind me as they could not compete
with my astonishing skill.

So my drama continued. I should have
awakened from this fantasy once I
couldn t put my feet into the ski boots.

After mashing my feet into the boots, I
picked up a pair of skis, and collecting
some poles, i went forth both bravely and
self-assuredly to encounter the mountain
one on one Needless to say. the mountain
won by a landslide.

For an hour, I practiced on the bunny
slope, haunting my unique ability of tally
ing down from any standing postion. When
i could finally manage to ski down the
slope without bumping, smashing, or
slamming into any four- or rive-yearolds,
I felt confident enough to leave the bunny
slope and accept my friends invitation to
5inn with them from THE TOP of the moun-

taAs the ski- lift propelled me uphill, the
theme from “Hawaii Five 0” spinning

through my head, I again imagined myself
zipping down the slope with amazing
speed, men whistling at my body as l
whizzed by them, though goodness knows
how any guy could tell my gender with all
the sweaters, coats, scarf, and skiing
equipment 1 had all over me; never
theless, stare at me they would with the uts
most admiration. Watch out mountain,
here I come!

“Are you ready to go? We’re almost at
the top," my friends interrupted my
dreams.

“of course I’m ready," I scoffed at
them. It was then that I made my fatal
mistake. I looked for the ground. When I
saw the distance to the bottom of die bill, I
realized that the mountain was HIGH, and
I had to get to the bottom with only two
sticks of wood attached to my feet. Was I
ready, they asked? To die? Not exactly.

Before I could start screaming, we had
reached our destination, and I found
myself falling off of the ski-lift onto the
snow on top of the mountain. Lying there in
the snow, my mind was continuing its
endless list of questions. “What are you do-
ing up there?“ it asked me. Hadn’t your
father stuck his pole through his leg the
first time he went skiing? Why, there's
probably a curse on your family when it
comes to skiing: Foleys + Skiing :
Doom/Death/Destruction/All of the
above. What are you doing with ski-boots
on your feet? Turn back, honey, while you
still have the chancel

I was about to demand that I be carried
back down the mountain, none of this skis
ing business for ME, when fate suddenly
took matters into its own hands: my skis
began to slide slowly. and then more rapid-
ly, down the mountain, with myself attach-
ed to them. “Ugh!" I cried, waving my
arms frantically, causing other skiers to
quickly remove themselves from my path.

Down the mountain I went, and on that
trip I learned many things; first and
foremost that there are many ways to fall
while skiing. I fell backwards, forwards,
and from side to side, with my legs landing
in a various number of postions around
me.

About halfway down the mountain, I
landed headfirst into the snow. As my
friends tried to pull me up, I felt tempted to
remain in the snow until somebody would
come to get me — hopefully with a car or
helicopter. It was then that I discovered
the greatest motivation there can ever be
for skiing down a mountain: I had to go to
the bathroom,

My friends quickly managed to get me to
the bottom of the hill, where I went rather
sheepishly to ‘the bathroom. In all my
years, I had never remembered James
Bond having to go to the facilities while be
ing chased or doing the chasing. In fact, I
don't remember ever seeing him going to
the bathroom. What a guy.

called out to her, “I-Iey Mary, sing, sing for
us, Mary!" And she did. She sang her
heart out. I saw Mary many times after
that. She was actually rather difficult to
avoid, because when she wasn’t sitting on
a bench downtown she was wandering
about somewhere else. One day I saw her
pushing a grocery cart in the rain, singing
to no one but the Wind.

When I was sixteen, I got a job working
at a restaurant downtown, 3 coffee-and-
burger type place. Mary was a regular
customer there; she would always sit in a
booth near the back, drinking a Cup of cof~
fee. She would hold very long conversa-
tions with herself, hours sometimes, and
she would pull out a crusty old wallet full of
photos and show them to her invisible com-
panion. The workers there were very nice
to Mary, treating her with as much respect
as they did any other customer. she
always paid, digging in her coin purse for
quarters and pennies. She wasn’t much of
a tipper, but she never caused any trouble.

I remember one time, my boss said, “I
wonder why Mary's so fat, when all she
does is walk around, all day long."

It was a mystery to me.

Some people said that Mary had been a
beautiful woman once. I never asked her, I
just filled her cup when it was empty. A
common line that one of my supervisors
would use on me, while I was in the back,
washing dishes,was, “Paul, your mother‘s
here.”

I would walk out, wiping my hands on
my apron, and open my mouth to ask
“Where?" when I would see Mary, squeeze
ing herself into the booth, and I would get
the joke, and I would laugh, but I would
always wonder, in the back of my head,
”What if She were my mother?”

I didn’t understand how someone could
get to be the way Mary was 1 knew the
world outside was hard and cold, but was it
really that hopeless?

And I would ask myself, “IS it possible
that Mary knows something that the rest
of us don’t?”

0! course, no one ever listens to people
like Mary. I know I never did.
