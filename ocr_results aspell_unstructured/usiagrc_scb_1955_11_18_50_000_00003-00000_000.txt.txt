Bowen‘Speech: Freedom of Min

Drr Howard Rothmann

Bowen was inaugurated as
the seventh president of
Grinnell college last Sunday
afternoon in Darby field-
house. The subject of his
inaugural address was "The
Free Mind.”

Following an academic pro-
cession of trustees, faculty,
class delegates, and special rep.
resentatives, Bowen was in-
stalled by John W. Norris,
president of the Grinnell trus—
tees.

Freedom oi the Mind

In his inaugural address
President Bowen said that “one
of the duties of liberal arts
colleges like, Gl'innell" is to
keep alive “freadom of the
mind." He proceeded then to
outline haw he planned to
achieve this goal at Grinnell,

“Freedom of the mind is,"
said Bowen, “the source of hu-
man individuality." And mod.
ern society must have “a sig—
nificant group of leaders with
free minds—people who can
think for themselves, who do
not passively conform, and who
have ideas and the courage and
ability to express them."

Produce Leaders

He proclaimed it the “unique
and urgent function" of the
liberal arts college “to produce
a group of leaders who have
the quality 1 have called the
free mind."

In describing the need for
the liberally~educated leader,
he said that “a college that also
votes itself steadfastly to the
objective of educating for free-
dom of the mind will have in-
fluence far beyond its numerical
Slzeu”

Future Policies

Dix Bowen then enunciated
his proposed policies on mat.
ters affecting students. the fac-
ulty, the educational program

d

 

oi the college, and financial
support.

“I believe," he said, ”that
Grinnell should remain small.
it should he the kind of place
where students and teachers
can know one another, a place
where the individual student
counts. and where he can exe
press his individuality and de-
velop his own unique talents.”

Quality oi students

in regard to the quality of
the student body he said, “i
believe that Grinnell should
continue to specialize in the
education of gifted young peo-
ple, and that in the selection of
its students, it should seek for
excellence.”

Dr. Bowen expressed his
faith in the Grinnell faculty
and listed his three aims “to
see that the environment of
Grinnell is so congenial to
them that they will be able to
do their best here."

First, he said, “salaries must
be increased further.” “Second,
the number of hours our faculty

members spend in the class-
room must loo reduced.” “Third,
greater provision should he
made for helping faculty mem-

bers to keep abreast oi their at the Grinnell Country club

fields and to participate in

protessional activities,"
Curriculum l

in regard to the educational
program of the college Bowen
suggested a reduction in the
course load for students.

“If a Student took fewer‘
Courses," lie explained, ”he I
could concentrate his efforts, he
could pursue creative work and
independent study in each
course, and he could achieve
something that few Students
ever experience, namely,
thoroughness." .

Financial support for the
college, Bowen said, must de-
pend upon alumni, corporations,
and the small contributor, With
the broader distribution of in-
come in recent years, “we
should be seeking a larger
number of smaller contributions
rather than a Smaller number
of larger ones."

Why do more dollege

men and women smoke

VICEROYS .

than any other
ﬁlter cigarette?

Because only Viceroy
gives you 20,000 ﬁlter traps
in every ﬁlter tip, made
from a pure natural substance
— cellulose — found in delicious
fruits and other edibles.’

Yes, only Viceroy has this ﬁlter composed of 20,000 tiny
. ﬁlter maps. You cannot obtain the same ﬁltering action
in any other cigarette

The Viceroy ﬁlter wasn’t just whipped up and rushed to

. market to meet the new and skyrocketing demnd foi- ﬁl-
tered cigarettes. Viceroy pioneered, Started research more
than 20 years ago to create the pure and perfect ﬁlter.

Smokers en mosse report that ﬁltered Viceroys have a
. ﬁner ﬂavor even than cigarettes without ﬁlters. Rich,-
satisfying, yet pleasantly mild.

Viceroy draws so easily that you wouldn’t know, without
. looking, that it even had a ﬁlter tip i . i and Viceroys cost
only a penny or two more than cigarettes without ﬁlters!

That’s why more college men and womcn smoke VlCEROYS than

any other ﬁlter cigaretle i , , that’s why VICEROY is Ihc largest-
selling ﬁlter cigarette in the world!
