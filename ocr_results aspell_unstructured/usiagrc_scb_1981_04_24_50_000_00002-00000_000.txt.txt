This afternoon, Grinnell Relays IX commences in all its splendor.
Unfortunately, a letter was circulated within the faculty and ad-
mini tration strongly objecting to what is now becoming a Grinnell
tradition. The letter, reprinted elsewhere in this issue, shows a
singular lack of understanding about the spirit of Relays as well as
being an underhanded way to undermine a student planned, sup-
ported and managed event.

The Relays originated almost a decade ago as a spoof on the in-
tense, highly competitive Drake Relays, which are held in Des
Moines at Drake University. Because the event went over so well the
first time, a yearly extravanganza began, always held on the same
weekend as the Drake event. Even Des Moines television stations air
footage of Grinnell along with script which describes Relays as a
play on the jock image.

The letter charges that Relays ”only purpose is competitive drink-
ing” but as stated above, the author is sadly mistaken. The word
“competitive” implies an attitude toward participation just not pre-
sent at Relays. The thrust of Relays is competitive drinking games
but only volunteers participate. The real gut purpose of Relays in a
Freudian sense is to work off the tension built by this time of year.
Relays marks the last big social event of the year before students
really buckle down to studying for finals and then go their separate
ways for the summer.

The other disturbing aspect of the letter is that it was circulated
only to faculty members and administration not to the students, who
are the driving force behind the event, Even Relays Committee
members were caught by surprise. The letter was addressed “An
Open Letter to President Drake and the Entire College Community”
but students did not receive copies from the author. Is this any way
to cause change? If anything it could only foster bad relations and
set up a students versus others feeling on campus.

Relays is a fun event in which anyone can take part, large or
small, talented or clumsy and still have a good time. Even President
Drake, who is known for his temperance, has encouraged the entire
community to take part. Community, that’s what Grinnell is all
about.

One added note: I'm: Is my last issue of the 5&3. Rich and Mike along with their stall
take over ml the next two weeks to sort of get a "feel" for the Job, 1 can‘t possibly
thank everyone in this space separately. 1 Just want to extend my appreciation to all
or the people at Grlnnell who have offered construcllve comments, critlclsms and
compliments, you students, faculty and administrator know who you are I also give
special thanks to all of my starters and the people at the Grinnell Herald-Register:
you people did a super job under circumstances which are far from ideal. And. lasl
but not least, I send my gratltlide to my family lor thElr love and supporl. I wish
everyone luck With their finals, have a great summer!
