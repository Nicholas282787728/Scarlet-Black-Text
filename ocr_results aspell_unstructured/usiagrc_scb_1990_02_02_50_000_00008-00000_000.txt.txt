the clay sculptures on display in the Student Exhibit in

the Fine Arts Building.

By Jennifer Mattem and
Elizabeth Banficld

If you‘ve wandered through
the lobby of the Fine Arts
building recently, you may have
noticed the eclectic show
"Painting and Sculpture:
Selections from the Beginning
Classes." Dick Cervene's
beginning oil—painting students
and Florence Zirkle‘s beginning
sculpture students have combined
their best works, and produced an
unconventional exhibit that
definitely merits a close look.

The show encompasses a
wonderfully broad mnge of media
and subject matter. Interspcrsed
between oil paintings of bright
foliage and surreal figure studies,
are a number of eye-catching
sculptures, including a gigantic
chain of wooden links, and
numerous busts which stare
eerily into space:

Cervene, ehair of the art
department at Grinnell,
animatcdly explained the show:
“Well, we didn’t want a show of
ALL nudes or ALL landscapes!"
Cervene expressed pleasure at the
variety of media used in the

exhibit: “..,[There are]
sculptures of wood and plaster,
oil paintings on canvas and
paper." Also included in the
collection are several absorbing
collages and a number of clay
pieces.

‘ Features of the exhibit
inclued a dynamic wood sculpture
enLitled, "Sailing" by Rina Kahn.
Among the paintings, art major
Laura Ferguson‘s sensitively
rendered "Figures" is both
complex and intriguing.

Tom Wickersham‘s clay bust,
the only one in the show that in
not a self-portrait, truly captures
the character of his subject, Mr.
Proter French. Wickersham
explained that he chose French, a
retired minister in Grinnell,
because " his facial characteristics
posess a spark and a zest for life
that you can't find in just
anybody."

Grinning, Cervene encouraged
all students to visit the show,
simply because “It‘s nice to see
what’s being done here."

So stop by the fine arts
gallery on your way to the Bar.
Who knows? You might be
inspired to try painting and
sculpture yourself.
