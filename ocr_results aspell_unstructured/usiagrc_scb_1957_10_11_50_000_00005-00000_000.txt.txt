. 1 For the second time in two
weeks, the Kohawks are involv-
ed in Saturday’s big game, as
they entertain lcague»leading
and undefeated Carleton. The
Carls are apparently much the
same type of team ‘as Ripone
light, tast, alert and opportu-

less dangerous passing attack.
The Kohawks feature a rugged,
heavy forward wall and a paws
lertul as well as deceptive
ground game. it Coe gets smart—
er quarterbacking and ever-
comes a tendency to throw
awayﬁboth literally and ﬁgura—
tively—scoring opportunities, its
chances of an upset win over
Carleton are excellent.

The other crucial game nits
undefeated Cornell against
twice-defeated st. Olat at
Northﬁeld. The records oi the
two teams are misleading,
since the 0125‘ deteats came
at the hands of league-lead.
ing Carleton and Ripon while
the Ram wins were scored
against cellar—dwelling Mon.
mouth and Knox. The 0les
will be seeking vengeance for
last year’s stunning 3548 loss
i and are iavored to get their
l revenge.

Aiter two bruising battles
against st. Olaf and Coe, Ripon
meets a breather in Grinnell.
Comparative scores against Coe
(41-29, 677) make the Redmen
two-touchdown favorites, but
Ripon faces a possible letdown
which could narrow the margin
as it did last year when the
Redmen just squeaked by the
winless Pioneers (21.14) after
scoring an upset victory over
Coe the week before._
