Athletic Directors Fight the Com-
mercializ'lng of the Honor
Letter.

Editor's note: The iouowing
article has been prepared by the
athletic directors oi the Western
conference and is published at
the suggestion of the local athletic
depnrunentl.

A large number ’of exccollege toot»
ball men are this fall playing proics.
sessional football. This has given
rise to the question as to whether this
is desirable. This should be con-
sidered frlm the standpoint of the.
players, the college and college ath—
lstics.

Fll'sl, while granting that the col-
lege boy very often is in debt when
he graduates and that the five hun-
dred or one thousand dollars which
he can make by playing professional
football will help him while he is get~
ting started in business or a profes-
sion still it may be questioned wheth-
er. after all he gets enough, all things
considered, for what he gives. in
many cases boys who have played pro—
fessional football for a number of
years at the end of the period of play—
ing find that their classmates who
devoted their time solely to the thing
for which they were trained have be
come better established than have the
pro footbau men. ,

The purpose of the college is to
equip men that they may he of the
greatest possible benefit to society. if
college men in increasingly large
numbers make a business of play-
ing professional football the tax pay-
ers who make possible the work of
the‘ university may well inquire
whether or not the colleges in so far
as the football men are concerned are
fulfilling their function. in fact
this is one of the arguments that is
being advanced these days against
college athletics. ot courser there
could be! professional football without
college football as there is a‘great
deal of professional boxing and very
little intercollegiate boxing. on the
other hand at the present time the
boy who now plays on a professional
football team is well paid for his

' services because he sells not only his
ability but also the name of the col—
lege he formerly represented. The
advance advertising for the profes—
sional game always announces that
the men who will play were fomerly
stars from such and such colleges.

The-Directors of athletics of the
‘Westel'n Conference are agreed that

it is not desirable that their men shall '

engage in professional football either

hetore or after graduation.

students and alumni can help Very

materlally by urging the men who

weal‘ the honor letters not to cum-
. mercialize those letters.
