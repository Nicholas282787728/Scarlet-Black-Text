in every group or people there are,l
always [mind a few who are willingnl
and are allowed, to shoulder tlic‘
greater part of the work of the coni-
munity. Such people are useful and
it is convenient to have somebody of
the sort around to been the brunt-of
things, hut is this fair, either to lhel
individuals or to the group?
often their energy, unlimited as it,
may seem to be, is dissipated over'
such an inﬁnite variety of tasks that
the result is a waste of their effort as
well as that of others.
For
. Black has advocated that some day the

several years the Scarlet and

point system would be put into effect
in Grinnell, a system that would arbi-
trarily limit the number of outside
which the individual
might participate. Such a system
would serve a double purpose. It
would prevent too great a dissipation
of energy on the part of a few, and
it would tend to distribute more
evenly among the students the bella-

activities in

nts that may be derived from a reascnr
able amount or extra work. i

To some, the arbitrary limitation of
outside activities would seem an in—
fringeineut on the rights of the indi-
vidual, but such a policy would gain
the support of the majority both of
those who do and those who do not
participate in outside activities; the
former because of the greater oppor-
tunities offered to those of their own
type, and the latter hecause they
realize that they are attempting too
much and must necessarily do many
things less well than they could do a
few things, and also because of the
realization that not enough students
engage in other than required work.

The matter of outside activities is
an all important one in every ethics:

tional institution and it is one that '-

reuuires deﬁnite action on the part of
the authorities and the students them»
selves. Some frown on outside work
because of the time detracted from the
purely scholastic side of things While
others encourage varied interests be—
cause they give a. practical contact
with affairs that is otherwise lacking.
Both factions may be found in our
own institution and thus the matter is
largely an individual one at present.
The women pf the school already have
a system of points that automatically
limits the number of positions, out
should the matter he ielt entirely to
choice among the men or should rler
cisive action be taken on the matter?
During the past few years a general
movement of reform has been sweep—
ing the universities and colleges or
the country and many. of them have
adopted a Wide spread system of limi-
tation that embraces everything From
athletics to literary work, from class
offices and aromatics to social activir
ties. Many of our contemporary \vestr
ern institutions have adopted similar
rules and they seem to be working
out satisfactorily for all concerned.
