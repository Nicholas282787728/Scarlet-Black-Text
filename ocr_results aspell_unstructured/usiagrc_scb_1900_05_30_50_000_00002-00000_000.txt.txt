posed of Belolt. Knox. Cornell
and Iowa College, is a step of the
greatest importance in the history
of debating at Grinncll. Our sllc»
eess in the past. would, at ﬁrst
glance, hardly warrant us in ex-
tendingour debating interests so
widely, but on second thought it
will be seen that our past record
is, in fact, the cause for this tors
ward movementt We not
stand still in debating any more
than we can in other things. We
must either go up or down and ins
dications were that we would be
gin to go down unless measures
were taken to in\ ill new life into
the Flagging iritéie t. It is with
this purpose in view that the dc-
bating leagucrs came to this (ch
cision, in the hope that a wider
ﬁeld and closer rivalry might stim-
ulate our debaters to renewed and
more successful efforts in the [us
ture. \‘Ve still believe that debate
ing enthusiasm is not dead but
sleeping. Thcrc is no reason why
it should not revive in this new
and vigorous competition with
colleges, the majority ot which we
have not met before in debate.
An opportunity has been given
us to take a fresh start and towipc
out the record of the past tour
years and we feel sure that it will
not be wasted. We will mention
only one of the indications which
lead listo this belief; the {act that

it contains very little of that ele-

bollst school in litci-atru-c, or which
Maeterliuck is perhaps the best
known representative, stands tor a
presentation of the truth of lite by
subtle suggestion and motits of
