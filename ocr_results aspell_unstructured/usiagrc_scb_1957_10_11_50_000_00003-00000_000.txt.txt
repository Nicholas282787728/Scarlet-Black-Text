5&3 Poll Shows Men's Views
On Revised Prepping Program’

By stalf Reporter

An S&B questionairc was circulated among the men
students Wednesday to gauge initial reactions to this year’s
prepping program. Thirty—five per cent of the men ans»
wered the questionnaire. The low percentage of men ans—
wering means that the Poll results can be interpreted only

as a possible indication of north campus opinion.
Under the new C of HP, the prepping program has

been radically changed. This
two week get acquainted period,
more participation in college ac-
tivities, and limitations on swat-
ting, hazing and time-consuming
tasks.

The changed program is Vier
ed as more constructive by sev-
enty-eight per cent of the up-
perclassmen. Freshmen general-
ly think that the program is been
eficial as they begin their col~
loge careers.

The main objections are to
the leniency of the program.
The upperclassmen (thirty-
five per cent) complain about
the lax attitude oi the preps,
and the inability to alleviate
this problem because of the
swattlng limitations. Nineteen
per cent-oi the freshmen think
the program is generally too
easy, and forty—three per cent
feel that the coo merit point
point requirement roi- activity
participation is too easy.

The latter innovation is a
controversial point in the pro.
gram. Sixliy per cent of the men
students are in favor of the gen—
eral idea of the 600 point sys-
tem. but had some objections to
it. A number of men felt that
600 points are too easy to obtain.
and others were strongly against
giving points for church attend-
ence. Forty per cent of the up-
perclassmen voiced objections to
the merit system. A South
Younker sophomore suggested
that the system was similar to
when he “used to go to Sunday
School to win a pin for perfect
attendance." others feel the pro-
