back; Campbell, quarterback; Huff.
guard; Pickett. center; Baluerson,
tackle, and Sheppard, end.

Coach Stark and his assistant, Line

Six Veterans
Form Nucleus

for 1931 Team

Coach Watt Task
inf Rebuilding Line
With Sophomores

Flaces

With the issuing of equipment to
varsity football squad members to-
day, Coach Lester L. (Fuzz) Watt
plans to begin regular practice drills
tomorrow in preparation for the
opening game of the season with Coe
college on Ward ﬁeld, Sept. 25,
Coach Watt is faced with the prob-
lem of building a team from inexper-
ienced men in two weeks before the
Pioneers take the ﬁeld against the
Kohawks.

Despite the fact that the Pioneers
have a veteran backﬁeld with four
lettermen returning, the line will be
almost entirely new since Captain
Oscar Christoffersen, center and
Charles BlIto, end, are the only Honor
G winners.

Prospects Drightencd
Although the outlook for the 1931
season has discouraged Pioneer fol—
lowers, hope for a winning team
seems much brighter as the season
draws nearer. There are several pros-
pects from last year's freshman
squad, who may be able to ﬁll
gaps in the line. Coach Watt also has
a wealth of material for the end and
backﬁeld positions,

Henry Thomas, Rock Island, 111..
whose auspicious debut as a triple-
threat man in his freshman year
stamped him as varsity calibre, will
return to take over.his.position at
quarter. Coach watt's "pony backs"
of last season, Ullrlch, James, Mc-
Creary, and Graﬂund, are returning
and will see service during the 1931
season. Harold Alexander and Frank
Spangler, also will make bids for
backﬁeld berths.

Rose Promising
From the sophomores, Al Rose.
brother of Harold Rose, leader of the
1929 Pioneer eleven, is the most
promising backﬁeld candidate. Bobby
Waite, lac-pound quarterback, and
Gaston Santi, will get chances to
show their wares. .
At the wing positions, Otto Gel
and Paul Edman are two reserves of
last year's squad who will make a
strong bid for the open berth. Both
will probably see action, since Bilto
will be handicapped by the injured
