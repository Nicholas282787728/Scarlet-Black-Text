JRC puts the green in Green-nell

3v Reszcca PARK

It turns out that joc Rosenfield not only
had green in his wallet, he had green on his
thumb. The new Campus Center offers the
most environmentally friendly features of any
building on campus.

Previously, when it came to supplying the
campus with energy, the school dealt with the
Forum's 42,000 square feet; it must now cons
tend with 127,0007which means more ens
ergy and higher costs.

This enormous increase led the campus
center design committee to emphasize energy
etticiency in the building's greenetneudly des
sign, As Dean Jim Swartz, vice president for
AcademicAffaits and energy expert, explained,
“More square feet inherently adds more energy
cost,” he said. “That's why energy efﬁciency is
important,"

The administrators liircd outside consuls
tants Green Roundtable, which made many
recommendations, though not all were up
plied. He explained that although envilonr
mentally friendly features were major factors
in the plan, energy efficiency issues were not
considered until midway through the lengthy
building process, preventing the committee
from putting into practice all the programs it
would have liked.

The center does, however, boast many
greenetriendly facets. The white roof (as ope
posed to black tar) and namral stone exterior
do not heat as quickly as other alternatives,

reducing the energy and money needed to
cool the building, The lighting system also
dramatically cuts energy consumption. Light
sensors, energy efﬂuent light bulbs and nur
merous windows limit waste and maximize
natural light.

The dining hall could be considered the
center of this new environmental conscious
ness. Due to Grinnell's new composting pres
gram, leftover food no longer goes to waste
once students put away their trays

Mike Burt, the associate director of Fa»
clllllcs Management and he. fits Grounds,
Landscape and Hauling d on, explained
that food waste from plates and fruit and veg
etable preparation goes through a pulper in
the dishwasher room, which grinds the food
into small pieces and squeezes out moisture to
make it lighter.

This compacted waste is then driven ovcr
about five times a week to a farmer who mixes
itwitli wood chips, hay and manure to produce
soil rich in nutrients. Not only does the local
economy benefit, but less space is taken up in
landﬁlls and waste does not have to be disposed
ofoffcampus as oftcn, rcducing transportation
costs and fossil fuel pollution,

The dining hall also uses exclusively postr
recycled consumer content napkins, according
to Heidi Conner ’09, co-leader of Free The
Planet, “Dining Sci-vices is one of the most
environmentally conscious departments on
campus," she said. “I think often times people

 

 

 

 

 

are too busy bitching to realize what they do,”

Burt also highlighted how the centraliza-
tion of the Roscnfield center has improved
the school’s recycling program. Housing dine
ing, the Grille and other student services to
gethcr creates one central waste collection site,
making the recycling process more efficient.

He also said that receptacles have been
placed throughout the building to encourage
students to recycle. There are newsprint and
magazine bins at the post office and containe
ers for plastic in the neighboring game room,
Plastic, tin, glass and cardboard are being tee
cycled at the dining hall and the Grille.

With the completion of the Rosenfield
Center, the campus has not only grown, but
also become greener, This comes after trustees
have agreed to build a wind turbine in Conard
Environmental Research Area (CERA) which
would provide the area’s energy.

But there still remains a wealth of envi~
ronmental issues to addiess. FTP continues
its campaign to bring more wind energy to
Gnunell, speciﬁcally two wind mrblncs to be
built north of campus, which would provide
for some ot~the campus's energy needs,

“FTP is trying to raise support from stu—
dents to have the trustees erect wind turbines,"
said Conner. “This is a pivotal moment in our
global well-being and Grinncll can make a
difference, and 1 think students can really push
policy through and activate from the ground
