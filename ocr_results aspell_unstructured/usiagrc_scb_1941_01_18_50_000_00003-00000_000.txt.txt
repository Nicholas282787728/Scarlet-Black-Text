Reviewer Finds
Concert Locked
Best Qualities

By Esther Carlson.

Leia Mae Flynn, soprano, and
Mario Berini. tenor, both of the
Chicago Civic Opera, appeared
here in a concert Thursday eve—
ning. A large crowd attended the
performance.

Both singers were listed as dra-
matic vocalists, and it was in the
dramatic selections that they dem-
onstrated their best singing.

Miss Flynn possessed a flexible
and mature voice which could
rise to powerful heights if the
occasion demanded. She seemed
to lack botii depth and power.
however, in the tower vocal
range. Her interpretation of
“Calm Is the Night" (Bohm)
was mellow and beautiful, while
“When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,”
one of her cncores, was present
cd with a great deal of charm.

Mr. Berini’s voice was a vi»
brant and impressive one, These
qualities were, best illustrated in
his rendition of "empire Mai
Fu" (Handel) and ”The Spirit
Flower” (Camp‘belivTipmn). The
latter, always a favorite. was
sung exceptionally well. As one
of two encores he offered aSpane

fectious gaity to the audience

The duets, from ”La, Tosca"
(Puccini) and from "Cavalleria
Rusticana" (Mascagnl) sung by
the two artists, were beautiful to
listen to. but uninteresting to
watch, for neither gave much
physical expression to the part.

Both Miss Flynn and Mr. Ber-
ini presented seven selections and
each was cncored two numbers,
Their voices were good, some~
times even bordering on excel—
Ience, but with really, superior
singers available on the radio,
one cannot help contrasting
“good" with “best” and finding
the comparison unfavorable,

students who do not take ads
vantage of the board, or who are
found guilty by the board, will
lose credit for the course, Young
stated.

This plan is to supplement the
regular examination rules, not re-
place them, Young emphasized.
Young Tells Purpose

The purpose of the proctoring
systcm, Young claimed, is to
make condi him which are con-
dusive to crihbing less possible.
“We do not feel that the student
who studies conscientiously for an
examination can compete with
those who feel that cheating is
an essential of their examination
procedure."

The proctors according to
Young, have been pledged to take
action if cribbing is evidenced,
