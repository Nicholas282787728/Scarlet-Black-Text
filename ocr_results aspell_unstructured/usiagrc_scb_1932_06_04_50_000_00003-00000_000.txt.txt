Our apologies for not having gotten
this tender bit of scandal to you
soor -.r, gentle readers, but the fact
is that Rod didn't contribute it until
the last minute. He admits having
been seen by Miss Tree in a state of
unuientionable undress while prepar—
ing for his bath in Arbor Lake, but
the question isiis or is not that

brilliant red, sunburn?

Doric wishes to thank all ot the

kind friends who sent in compliments

on the first Doric under the new man-

agement. Both were sweet state»

You alumni which we incidentally
want to greet. missed out on some
pipe exams. They only lasted a week
and we're merely worried about six

And we don’t suppose you heard
about the prof who reminded Madame
x on the front row that the exam-
ination was merely academic. We've

heard of worse but don't know where.

Van slyke (pronounced slick) pro-
tests against the Brown Derby from
the standpoint that the students are-
n't the Bull Fighters but this is the
duty fulfilled by the faculty. We
have noted your objection, Mr. Van
Slyke and will turn it over to the
board of directors for further action.

What an awful fete for the outdoor
pageant last night—that terrible rain.
And mentioning the fete, all those
quadites who aren’t participating
may get their tickets at Talbott's.
They are both being saved for you.

Just to satisfy our curiosity about
you alumniers. we looked up all
about you in old Dories. Some terr-
rars! Blanket parties, illegal ex s,
smoking, dancing in the parlors, and
staying up way late after 10 o'clock.
Quite a change in Chuck Delorig
who is now peacefully racketeering-
the magazine game in Little Cicero
and Little Sicily in Chicago.

And poor Kennie
forced to spend what few pennies he
has on a new Nash, If that is what
being poor does to onc, we’re going
out and buy a Cadillac yacht.

And now comes the time of the year
to farewell the seniors. As we hid a
szld adieu,

Klemme finishes the last 700 pages
of his thcory report and wraps up his
worn out hand.

Woody stops telling the gullible
underclassmcn why he is so good and
how he got by with that exam.

Koenig completes his 77th rubber
of pitch with Archie anti reminisces
about his life as a politician.

Georgie Murray says goodbye to
her protogecs and turns over her lit~
tle court to Katherine. (This is pure
news.)

Bob Blazier sits quietly and con-
templates how sad Helen Will be
when all her bob parties are over.
