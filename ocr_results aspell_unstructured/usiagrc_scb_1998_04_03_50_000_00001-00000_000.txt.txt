Indonesia Breaks Up Student Protest; 40 Hurt
JAKARTA, Indonesia - Indonesian police ﬁred tear gas
and hurled stones at students yesterday to break up.an
antrgovernrnent protest in the Central Java universrty
town of Yogyakarta, injuring 40 students, witnesses
said.

They said about 1,000 students gathered at the campus
of the state-run Gadjah Mada University, demanding
President Suharto step down and calling for lower
prices ofessentials, which have soared with the fall of
the currency rupiah against the dollar.

“Three students were taken to hospital because of their
injuries," said the witness, adding that police brought
stones at their trucks. ‘
Police in Yogyakana were not available for comment.
There have been scattered riots and antirgovernment
protests across the country in recent months amid the
country’s worst economic crisis in decades.

The currency, the rupiah, has lost more about 70 per-
cent of its value since July, resulting in galloping inﬂa-
tion and job losses and prompting a $43 billion bail-
out package led by the International Monetary Fund.

Brazil Begins to Count Toll ofAi'nazon Fires
BRASILIA, Brazil - Helped by heavy rain, ﬁreﬁghters
Thursday worked ro extinguish the last ﬂames in the
northern Amazon as Brazilian environmental ofﬁcials
began assessing the impact of recent blazes and sought
to deter farmers from setting new ﬁres,

“The situation is under control but our operation re-
mains in place,“ said army major Jorge Fraxe, a spokes
man for Brazil‘s biggest-ever ﬁreﬁghting operation of
1,700 men.

He said firemen and soldiers were tackling ﬁres in two
districts in northern Roraima state on the border with
Venezuela. Those were the only areas deprived of the
rain which put out blazes in the savannah and jungle
on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Officials from the government’s Environment Institute
(IBAMA) ﬂew over the region to begin assessing the
damage caused by the Amazon’s worst fires on record.
“Clearly, a bigger area has burned than in previous
years. But the numbers some people have been com-
ing up with are grotesquely exaggerated," said IBAMA
president Eduardo Martins.

Government estimates on the total area burned have
Varied from 2,300 square miles to 1 1,500 square miles,
roughly the size ofBelgium.

Most of the area is Savannah and convened farmland,
which burn each dry season. But this year’s ﬁres also
damaged rain forest normally too humid to burn.

Clinton Visits Slave Site; Ends Africa 'Ik‘ip
GOREE ISLAND, Senegal - President Clinton ended
his six-nation African tour Thursday with an emotional
tribute to African—Americans and the continent their
ancestors left as slaves, ,

Clinton left Africa en route to Washington late Thurs-
day at the close of his 12-day tour.

“Goree Island is as much a pan of our history as a part
of Africa’s history,” Clinton said in the ﬁnal speech of
his tour at a monument to the horrors of the trans-At-
lantic slave trade.

As expected, Clinton offered no U.S. apology for the
trade in which at least 20 million Africans were up-
rooted and shipped into bondage in the Americas over
three centuries. .

But he paid tribute to the suffering of the slaves and to
the role played by the 30 million Americans descended
from them. ”The long journey of African-Americans
proves that the spirit can never be enslaved," he said.
Clinton, looking relaxed, said that he had seen the fu-
ture of Africa in the faces its people.

“I remain more convinced that when I (first) came here
that, despite the daunting challenges, there is an Afri-
can renaissance,” he told Senegal's president, Abdou
Diouf.

Clinton and wife Hillary also visited Ghana, Uganda,
Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana.

‘Tumblng Walls’ seeks to break down cultural barriers

Minneapolis duo seeks to foster understanding between Jewish and African American communities

BY SARAH REINHARD
Staff Writer

A unique collaborative performance of
dance and theater, designed to break down
cultural barriers, is scheduled to sweep
through the Harris Center.

“And the Walls Come Tumblln’
Down," a program by Judith Brin lngber
and Mary Easter of Minneapolis, seeks
to foster understanding between Jews and

- African Americans by embracing both the
similarities thatjoin these groups and the
differences that make each one unique.

“It's Black-Jewish dialogue through
the lens of these two individual people
who have come to tell the story of their
lives," said Rabbi Deborah']. Brin,
Ingber’s sister.

Rabbi Brin, who saw the pair rehearse
over Winter break, decided it would be a
wonderful program to bring to Grinnell.
Though the college hosts a variety of
multicultural events, this performance
stands out as a combined effort to foster
understanding between different groups,

“And the Walls Come Tumblin'
Down," while largely sponsored by
Chalutzim and Concerned Black Students
[CBS]. has received financial support
from numerous campus groups and def
partments.

“I think it's a good thing and a unique
thing to see on this campus, especially
because this particular performance deals
with Jewish and Black relations,“ said
Jason Czaja ‘98, a member of Chalutzim,
“They bring together aspects of their heri-
tages that are different but done for the
same reasons."

Inspiration for the program began three

years ago when Ingber started, along with -

other artists. musicians, and dancers. to
work for Jewish/African-American rela-

tions.

Upon reading a slave account by a
woman waiting to join the Underground
Railroad, Ingber noticed similarities to
pieces written by children in hiding dur~
ing the Holocaust.

"I tried to intersect the writings, and
bring in the peril of both situations,” noted
Ingber.

The resulting program addressed dif-
ferent situations that combined Jewish and
African~American culture.

Beginning with a scene involving two
elderly women discussing their histories,
it moved to the New York sweatshops and
various sit-ins or demonstrations, empha-
sizing a common “hiding" theme.

Two years later, with a new grant al—
lowing expansion for other audiences.
Ingberstaned acollaboration with women
from Carleton College.

Mary Easter, a Professor of Dance at
Carleton, graduated with Ingber from Sa-
rah Lawrence College.

“The basic framework of the perfor-
mance stayed the same," said Ingber, “but
we expanded and [Easter] added her per-
spective."

Easter, who is a poet, choreographer,
and video maker as well as Professor of
Dance, composed a poem, entitled “Bone
Heard Music,“ to open and close the pro-
gram.

“If we could stand ﬁrmly in our own
history and culture,” wrote Ingber in the
program, “knowin g that others recognize
us there, we could connect with one an-
other.”

”And the Walls Come Tumblin’ Down”
is largely autobiographical. with both
women contributing stories and perspec-
tives from their backgrounds.

“It’s the story through choreography of
how these women have broken through

Judith Brirt Ingber and Mary Easter will perform “And the
Walls Came Tumblin’Dawn " tomorrow at 8pm in Harris

walls." noted Rabbi Brin.

The artistic foundation provides for a
particularly enriching and ground breake
ing performance, one that addresses dife
ﬁcult issues with creativity and poise.

“It’s a dance piece," said Rabbi Brin,
“but it’s really a theatrical presentation 7
there’s dialogue, song, and dance.“

After performing, Easter and Ingber
will facilitate a discussion for students

interested in conversing with the artists.

“This is the perfect opportunity for us
to bridge the entire Grinnell community,"
said Sherman Willis ‘01, a member of
CBS.

Willis noted that the collaboration is
likely to draw a large audience, since it
combines many cultural perspectives.

The performance will take place on
Saturday, April 4, at 8:00 pm.

Staff Writer

Grinnell's Professor of Chemistry
Luther Erickson will be honored April 4
with a symposium. Over 70 former stu-
dents are returning to join faculty mem-
bers in the celebration.

The Erickson Symposium, which was
organized by the Grinnell Chemistry De-
partment, Will begin at 1:30 pm with a
lecture by Dr. Mary Sue Coleman ‘65 in
room 2022 in the Noyce Science Center.
Coleman, a member of the Board ofTrustr
ees, is now the president of the Univer~
sity of Iowa. She will present a lecture
entitled “In pursuit of function: An en-
zyme comes of age."

Matthew Elrod ‘89 began his ﬁrst—year
with a tutorial course on water. This week-
end he will deliver a second lecture at 4: l 5
pm in room 2022 in the Noyce Science
Center on water chemistry. Elrod is an as-
sistant professor of chemistry at Hope
College in Holland, Michigan,

Shortly before the research of 24
Grinnell alumni will be presented during
a poster session from 2:30 a 4:15 pm in
the Ahrens Atrium of the Noyce Science
Center.

Erickson is retiring after 35 years of

teaching chemistry to hundreds of
Grinnell College students, “This is my
36th year. I will continue writing and do-
ing research. I will also have an ofﬁce,
but I won’t have to grade all those pa-
pers," stated Erickson. However, he will
remain at Grinnell under Senior Faculty
Status, an arrangement in which profes-
sors may continue research programs and
other activities until they reach the age of
70.

Lee Sharpe, Professor of Chemistry
said "It is very exciting. I think it will be
nice to have old students come back and
give posters and honor Luther's retire
ment. He has had a big impact on a lot of
students over the years."

Erickson was an honors graduate at St.
OlafCollege. He went on to get his Ph.D.
in physical chemistry from the University
of Wisconsin. Erickson began to teach at
Grinnell in 1962 after completing a three
year service as assistant professor of
chemistry at Dickinson College and post-
doctoral summer rescarch appointments
at Penn State University.

During his long years at Grinnell,
Erickson has taught firstryear chemistry
courses and physical chemistry courses.
In both of these categories, he has helped
develop multirperiod project laboratories.

In 1983, Erickson’s teaching was rec-
ognized nationally with the CMA Cata»
lyst Award. He also presented an address
there entitled ”0n the Importance of Tra»
ditions in Science and Education."

Erickson has created an active research
program. He has served as a mentor to
over a hundred undergraduate research-
ers. Many of these students are included
as co-authors of his 30 research publica-
tions.

Regarding his retirement, Erickson
commented that he didn’t expect to have
any problems staying busy. “We have a
27 acre tree farm, which my wife and I
have been convening to a little oasis for
the last 24 years. That should occupy
some of my time.And instead ofgoing to
Florida for a week at Christmas time, we
will go for 2, or 3. I have time for some
golf. but I haven‘t gotten any better," he
said.

 

New campus organization focuses

on students of m

BY SARAH REiNi-IARD
Staff Writer

Mixed Plate, a new campus group, is
providing students of mixed heritage at
Grinnell College with an opportunity for
discussion and suppon.

“There are a lot of people on campus
with these issues.” said Nick Schapira ‘00
who is a member of the group, “and
they’ve never had a forum to discuss them.
We're working to create an outlet."

Of the multicultural groups currently
at Grinnell, this is the ﬁrst specifically
devoted to students of mixed racial back»
grounds.

Many students feel that with the grown
ing prominence of multiculturalism in the
public arena, a campus organization dealr
ing with such important issues is abso-
lutely necessary.

“At times things aren't always black
and whiteA they‘re shades of gray,"
Schapira said. “People on campus should
be educated.“

Started last semester as a suppon circle,
Mixed Plate is now an ofﬁcial student
group with funding eligibility.

The small, intimate core group of about
nine people meets weekly to discuss cur-
rent issues and personal experiences.

Issues such as interracial dating and
transracial adoption are frequent topics of
discussion. This past Tuesday, the group
talked about media's portrayal of interra~
cial families.

The aim of the organization is to cre-
ate a network of support, a forum for dis
cussion on campus and events to facilir
tate opportunities for students dealing with
mixed heritage issues.

“Through discussion, people learn
about themselves," noted Schapira. “And
through our own experiences, we can help
create a correlation."

A group similar to Mixed Plate was
tentatively begun four years ago.
"Shades," as it was called, attempted to
provide a similar support atmosphere.

Shades disbanded after a semester.
Now, many of its original founders have
reconstructed the club by forming Mixed
Plate.

ixed heritage

Multicultural and Academic Advising
Counselor Melissa Scheid helped get the
new group off the ground. She met dur—
ing ﬁrst semester with students to ask
them about their ideas for the organiza-
tion.

This semester, Scheid has pushed to
get students more involved by theme
selves.

“Everyone can have a voice and feel
valid about having a voice,” said Andrea
Long ‘98, who was one of the original
founders of Shades.

Members of Mixed Plate have big
plans for the future. They are hoping to
set up a resource library focused on
multicultural heritage.

For students who may not wish to par-
ticipate in discussions, such a library
would provide helpful information re-
garding multicultural heritage that they
could pursue on their own.

“College is a time for lots ofpeople to
ﬁnd themselves," said Schapira. “Lots of
people go through four years and never
have these issues resolvedi we want to
address them."

Mixed Plate also hopes to bring a trav-
eling exhibit to campus next year that
deals with interracial marriage and
transracial adoption.

The exhibit is comprised of various
pictures, displayed with captions that dis-
cuss speciﬁc situations.

“It's a powerful exhibit that evokes a
lot of feelings," stated Schapira. “We are
in the midst of planning to bring it here
next semester."

Though the group is new and, accord-
ing to Schapira, in a “transitional period,"
members of Mixed Plate are enthusiastic
about their organization. They are work»
ing to expand its development in order to
encourage awareness and tolerance on
campus.

“I’m really excited— it’s a good
thing.” said Ginger Lucero ‘98. “I‘ve
noticed lots of students this club could
beneﬁt."

Mixed Plate meets Tuesdays from 7~8
pm. in the Harris Center lounge. Students
who have questions for the group or are
interested in participating should e~mail
[mixed], [long], or [lucero].
