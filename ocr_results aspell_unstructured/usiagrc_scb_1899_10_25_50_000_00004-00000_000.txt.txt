(the Eltlllctc.

Our team leaves for Minneapolis
Friday morning to do battle tor the
honor of their school it“£llll>ltlle Mill-
nbsota team Salulda), tttel'llooil, alld
they c: 'y the best wishes of the
school witll them. the practice this
week has been considerably Newer
than previously and the team has
benetitett thereby. their experience
with the State Normal hoys last Satr
ulday was almost invaluable to them,
The team has been shifted a bit back
of the line.
occupy his old position at quarter.
Bind, Clarke, and either Fiske or 1y
lllall will hold down the other three
positions, There is strong Colllpetl'
tioll also tor the line positions. Zieg-
her is playing tiel‘ce hall and will make
an invaluable substitute it he does riot
secure one of the illlrcll coveted posir
tiolls on the tealll betore tile season
closes. Knapp bucks the line ﬁercely
and eﬂectively, but has a fatal tell'
delrcy to fumble at critical times.
Others are deserving of special merr-
tion did space permit.

For the team as a whole we can
say that their otl'erlsive play is int-
pioved a great deal as well as their
defensive, which was markedly weak
last Saturday. Tile team has excel-
lent wind and endurance, thanks to
Tlaillei Watson, and there seems lll'
tle likelihood of their being taken oil
their feet or weakened pcreeptihly by
their opponents.

Minnesota’s team this fall
playing much better t'ootball tllail it
did last year. They have adopted the
graduate coaching system. Mr. Leary,
their
football into his proteges than all
their hired foreign coachcrs whom
they have had during the last three
seasons, and ill consequence, the
Grillllell team will encounter the
toughest proposition of the year up
to tilis time. Their backs are tast
alld sure. Glover, their full back, is

l’r‘obahly Lindsay will,

has been y

head coach, has instilled more,

 

lil tile lille tlley have all evenly devel-
oped lot of players, tow stars, blrt a
“gang of pluggers” which are more to
he feared than a lot of stars poorly
lcuached.

‘dictioll as to ille outcome of the con-
test as the games played by Grurnell
and Minnesota so far otter no just ba-
sis of comparison. However, a grain
of comfort may be gleaned flonl the
facts that illthe last tour years, Grin-
lllell and Minnesota have broken even.
Were Minnesota to take the trip our
ltealll must take we would make the
suggestion that this yeal thele is all
even thing also.

Goodnow Scientific Association.

once rllore been revived and the at-
telldance at the ﬁrst meeting, held
Monday evening, promises a consider-
able interest iu this department of so»
ciety work. This association has to
(to with a class oi work which cannot
be dealt with ill the ordinary literary
society, and oil tlle other hand, it is
not the intention to make it replace
society \i or k. it will be simply an
hour or two spent every two weeks ill
the discussion of subjects of interest
ill the scientiﬁc world, from a scien-
tiﬁc standpoint alld ill a scientiﬁc
manner.

The program Monday was of a pre-
liminary llatllle, and more. for the
iplll'pose of giving an idea of the work
lot the association than for anything
:else. Pl‘ot. Helldrixsorl gave a very
linteresting discussion of “Tuberculos-
iis,” after which l’l‘ot.Alllly and others
spoke brieﬂy on the prospects of the
association. After some discussion it
was (leaded to hold the meetings on
lMonday evenings at eight o’clock alld
