Arbitration gets the axe

Selected lowa trustees and the
administration have rejected the
proposal by Robert Conley, legal
counsel {or the Teamsters union, to
enter binding arbitration.

Attempts to settle the ten-week-
old strike with a tederal mediator
have tailed, aiter tour weeks oi
negotiations.

The iinal step, binding arr
bitration, would call in an imr

Lettuce

to face
vote

by Kyle Schaub

Pct policy quietly slipped into
law, 15-0-3. as the annual lettuce
boycott issue sprung into hot
debate at Wednesday‘s Student
Government Association (SGA)
session,

Charlie Becker presented the
United Farm Worker's appeal to
use only UFW-picked lettuce.
Becker recommended that SGA
Continue the boycott approVed by
students last year,

Jerry Ramaker, Saga iood
manager, proposed that when
UFW lettuce i_ lot available, Saga
be permitted to use non-union
lettuce rather than none. Alter
considerable debate. Craig Hobbs
moved to accept Ramaker‘s
suggestion.

As a result, students will vote on
the boycott question which SGA
approved, use. The {list question
asks if a boycott on all lettuce that
does not bear the UFW emblem be
Continued, and the second asks that
ii Saga cannot get UFW lettucc,
other lettuce may be used it
labeled nonrunion.

A two-thirds majority is needed
to pass the reterendum, based on a
motion by Jeff Bob. Last year’s
boycott votc passed with 82 per
cent of the student vote.

Other action included 1! 10-7-2
Vote to recommend to the ud'
ministration that smoking still be
allowed in classrooms, in [ace of a
iaculty recommendation to the
contrary '

partial third party to decide final
contract items still under debate,
There is no appeal to iinal contact
terms under this decisionrmaking
process.

The administration explained its
refusal to enter binding arbitration
in a letter released to the college
community Tuesday. The
statement suggested that ar-
bitra on is not the only means tor
attai ing a lair settlement since
the College Strongly feels that it
has already oiiered a “completely
fair settlement,”

The College also expressed
hesitation over the complete
control that the third party would
have in the dispute. The statement
Said, “No arbitrator, how'ever well-
intended, can be expected to ap
preciate fully the College‘s
fin ncial situation, its responr
sib ity to its other employees, non-
academic and academic, and its
obligation to those who must pay
increased tuition.”

Paul Neal, business agent of
Teamster Local No. 90, was not
available for comment on the

union’s reaction to the College's
negative position on binding are
bitration.

Demands far apart

According to the ﬁgures released
in the College statement, the dif-
ference in total cost between the
College's Sept. 12 otter and union
demands stands at $105,113, The
issues still in dispute are wages,
vacation holidays, longevity pay,
cost-oi ' ng clause, hospital in
surance and retirement cons
tribution,

Federal mediator in the strike,
Joe Esselman, has not called any
meetings since the proposal was
made to go to binding artibration
by the union.

Future plans to settle the strike
remain uncertain. The College has
urged, however, that the striking
unioll members “discuss and
consider again in a membership
meeting the College's offer to settle
this strike.” The union, on the
other hand, placed posters earlier
in the week around campus asking
the college to accept binding ar-
bitration.

lBMexecutivc

Learson is a member of the
executive and finance committees
Of the International Business
Machines corporation. He joined
IBM in 1935 following his
graduation irom Harvard
university.

In an address to the 1572 spring
Joint Computer Conference,
Learson dealt with matters of
management use of computer
systems.

He stated at the conference that
“There is a paradox that is
developing in the use of computers
by large organizations. On the one
hand, in the mamagement or a
society as big and complex as ours,
there is need ior greater and
greater quantities of information
that will help us control What we
are doing and know better where
we are going, But on the other
hand, there is the {ear that comr
puters also make it possible for
large organizationsiand lor the
govcrnmcnt in particulareio know
too much about us."

In an address to the Financial
Excutive Institute, Learsbn
examined the demands onvthe‘

American business community
voiced by consumer and ecological
movements.

Learson stated in that address,
“While the public has become
disenchanted with business
growth, it has, at the very same
time. increased its expectations of
the business systems. it expects
business to be more than profit-
maker—to be, in addition. public
servant, solver of social ills,
supporter oi standards in the
public interest . . . dedicated to
more than money.”

Second year

The Senior Fellow program is
now in its second year at Grinnell.
The program is conducted by the
Woodrow Wilson National
Fellowship Foundation with the

grant from the Lilly Endowment,
designed to “promote greater

Sharing of ideas and experiences
between the academic community
