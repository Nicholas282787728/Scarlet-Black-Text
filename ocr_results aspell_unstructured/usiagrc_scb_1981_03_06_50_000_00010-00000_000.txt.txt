The us. Strategic Air Command
(SACl “is making the world sale for
US. ﬁrst use" at nuclear weapons,
Daniel Ellsberg argued this point about
what he views as the aggressive nature
of U.S. nuclear arms policy at a press
conference at the Catholic Worker
Relief House in Des Memes Thursday,
Feb. 26 and at the Trinity Methodist
Chili-ch that evening in a talk titled
"SAC: what is its profession?"

The main Sign outside SAC's Oilutt
Air Force Base near Omaha was what
brought Ellsberg to Des Moines to
Speak on the topic. Until Dec 28, 1980,
the sign displayed SAC'S motto, "Peace
Is Our Profession." On that day three
members of the Des Moines Catholic
Worker Community tCWCl and seven
others irom ditterent states and
organizations decided to alter the sign
in iavor of what they felt was a more lit-
tin'g motto. They painted the word
"war" over "peace" so that the sign
read ”WAR Is Our Profession "

Three people in the group were then
arrested for destroying government
property: Frank Cordaro and John Huts
chins of CWC and Bill Douglas oi the
Iowa City Socialist Party. The three are
now awaiting trial lor this charge,
which is a felony in Nebraska because
oi the purported $2,600 value at the sign.
Nicknamed the "Innocent Three,” they
inspired Ellsberg to come to Des
Moines to speak and raise lunds in
defense of their action and the message
behind it.

Ellsberg maintained in his talk that
most Americans believe the purpose of
SAC is to deter nuclear attack on the
United States but that this has never
been a major part oi SAC‘s lunction. He
based this claim on the history of SAC,
the types and volume oi. missiles the
United States possesses and his own exV
perience as a former war planner in the
Pentagon. He cited the fact that SAC
was created in the 19405 before the
Soviet Union had a single Arbomb and
stated that the United States has been
vastly superior and the leader in the
race for greater nuclear arms capablli~
ty until the last five years when the two
major powers have reached a rough
parity.

Recalling 1961 and the Berlin crisis
when the United States had what he
called a "monopoly" of strategic forces
over the U,S.S.R ,Ellsberg stated, "It's
as much oi a hoax today as it was then
to say that the Soviet Union will over
power us." He expressed anger that the

American people have been misled
about nuclear arms policy, that they
didn't vote [or such a policy and that it
is "time to tell the American people the
truth;" that SAC's main function is not
deiense, but oftense ,, the development
oi iirst or preemptive nuclear strike
capability over the Soviet Union

As an alternative to the arms race he
described Ellsberg suggested, "an im‘
mediate bilateral freeze on the produc
tion, testing and deployment ol
stratetic nuclear arms " When asked
how the United States could count on
the Sovxet Union's support 01 such an
agreement, he responded. "I trust them
to want to aVOid extinction ‘ He states
that this measure, which he lelt would
satisfy the United States. its allies and
the Soviet bloc, had never been propos»
ed to the Soviets by the US. govern-
ment. He made clear his support ol the

use oi limited nuclear weapons as a
deterrent on nuclear attack on the
United States but ielt strongly that this
should be the only iunctlon of these
weapons.

0n the very current issue at potential
US, military involvement in El
Salvador Ellsberg stated, "We are in El
Salvador right now; that is our war
right now. ' He described what he lelt
were the diiteront lessons Americans
learned irom the war in Vietnam. that
Reagan and many other conservative
lorelgn policy makers learned "next
time nuclears“ but that the three
million Vietnam veterans and countless
"anti-war veterans ivill be very knows
ing” about such situations as El
Salvador and have learned that there is
"more you can dolor your country than
keep you mouth shut about a wrongful
war,
