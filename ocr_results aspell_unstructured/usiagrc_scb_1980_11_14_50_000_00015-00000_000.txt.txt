Opposes change in Health Service

To the Editor: Mr. ’l‘ederman recently
presented son with a proposal [or the
transferral of the College Health Ser-
vices to Iacilities at Grinnell General
Hospital. He asked for the students' opi-
nions, yet he seems unwilling to listen
to any of those opinions which differ
lrom his. This change will not, as I see
it. be as great a benefit to the Student
body as Mr. Tederman seems to
believe,

To begin with, the hospital is quite a
distance away, of course, there would
be a 24~hour student-run shuttle ser-
vice, but wouldn't you feel guilty about
disturbing a Iellow student just because
you had a cold and needed some throat
lozenges? 1 know I’d teel guilty , even
it they were being paid, And during the
winter — is it really sate to negotiate
the snow-packed, icy roads?

Along with this goes the fact that
most Grinnell students run on very
tight schedules. The only time they find
now to stop at uie Health Center is on
their way to or irom somewhere. And
anyway, even it it is still a “Health
Center." the [act that it would be at the
hospital would be a great detriment.
”Hospital" is a scary word 7 no matter
what the purpose.

Dean Tederman has been raving
about the increase in services which
would become available to the students,
services such as lab work and
radiology. But what he doesn't mention
is that x-ray and lab technicians are on-
ly at the hospital from 7 am. to 3 pm.
on weekdays and will continue to keep
those same hours. You'd still need a
doctor's‘tnot a Health Service nurse’s)
orders for this type oi service. And they
probably wouldn't be any more willing
to call a doctor after 3 pm. than they
are now. So instead of gomg to the
Health Center and being reterred to a
doctor who sends you [or x-rays, you'd
go to the hospital, then go to the doctor,
then back to the hospital for the x-rays.
The result would be, I'm afraid, that
students would give up using the Health
Service altogether. Once you get to the
hospital tor your x-rays, they may be
rude to you or they may not want to
treat you (as they have done so often)
just because you are a student. And if
you spend the night there, you're liable
to get lessAthan-loving-care from a
nurse just because you're a student (as
I have in the past). That would end the
era oi sleeping at the Health Center just
for fatigue, as many students do now.

Also along the lines at things Dean
Tederman never told us . . . he uses
Knox College as an example of a college
who uses their local hospital as a Health
Service. That‘s because Knox doesn’t
have a building available tor those pur»
poses as we do. What about the many

November 14, WHO

other small colleges which have effi-
cient, wellrrun, onrcampus student
health centers? And about our building:
Mr. Tederman seems to overlook the
lact that when the money tor our
building was donated, it was wiﬂi the
stipulation that it be used only for an
dent Health Services. How does Mr.
Tederman propose to get around that?

All in all, there are so many ways in
which our Health Center can be improv-
ed without being eliminated, What
about the blood drive, the health and
fitness week, and omer such events
which the Health Service is not invited

to participate in? And what about
women's health care? Did you know
that there is a whole library on human
sexuality in the Health Center?
Perhaps the solution is not to eliminate
this badly needed service, but to im-
prove it so uiat it can be something of
which we are proud. And the decision
should belong to the students 7 not to
the faculty twho are not even entitled to
the Health Center services). Come on,
Walker and Tederman, it's our tuition,
let us have a say in our school Iorpncel

The SGA Circus

To the Editor: Haven’t we all been
exposed to enough shallow political
campaigns lately? I honestly hoped
that alter the presidential election we
could all return to our “normal” lives
and not be bombarded with the super-
ficial and manipulative “image“
politics we’ve unwillingly inherited.

Now we’re subjected to the tortures
of a SGA campaign that certainly lives
up to SGA's well-known reputation as a
”joke." No wonder SGA is thought of as
a circus when most of the candidates
perform like circus animals for their
gallery. Cliches (“openness” and “in
put”), half promises (pledging to in

run for their offices by insulting the

Whose fault is it that SGA is a Joke?
