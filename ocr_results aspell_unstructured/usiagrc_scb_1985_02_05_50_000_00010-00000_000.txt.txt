Brick vultures: Scavengers or Entrepreneurs?

, _Co‘nservatives oiten complain that the
national media slants its news coverage in
order to give an unfair emphasis to the
ideas of the American political left.
Liberals respond that the media s
coverage Is mostly “fai ” But this
response misses the pomt- s precisely
the medias definition of “fair' which
makes its news coverage so biased.
perhaps no example better illustrates the
liberal biases of the national media than a
small story about brick piltering in
Chicago aired by CBS over break. The
story was a microcosm of the ideological
slant which characterizes our national
news coverage and it demonstrates the
essential truth of conservative claims
about America s biased reporting.

The report related how condemned
buildings in Chicago are being illegally
stripped of their bricks by poor people.
who sell them to contractors who. in turn.
use them to build expensive houses. The

bricks derive their value irom their
thickness and weather-beaten look, which
adds an antique air to anything built with
them. Unfortunately. brickascavenging
has not elevated itseli to a science 7 the
scavengers insist on removing bricks from
the bottom half oi the buildings with tragic

results that, to date, two people have been
killed in selfrinduced brick avalanches,
CBS reported all this. and then went on
to stress how awiul this development was.
Imagine! Poor people forced to steal
bricks for the sake or a iew measly dollars
by a declining economy. tragically risking
their lives in the American greedrgame.

Zln Search of a Name Substituting

, Every semester I tell students in general
psychology about reiniorcement pro
cedures. The description of positive relnr
forcement is quickly understood The
‘distinction between punishment and
negative reinforcement. however. baffles
some people. Punishment occurs when
behavior is followed by an aversive
‘stimulus. Negative reinforcement occurs
when the aversive stimulus is removed.
The two terms are not synonomous, I
‘make this distinction for students 'every
semester. and when a student confuses the
'terms. as Owen Charles did In his article
on grading tDeciot, i get indigestion.
"Negative reinforcement has become
punishment for me.

would say knee jerkl reaction to negative
reinforcement. I think that the goal of

‘jected academic grades to a behavioral
analysis. a strategy of which i thoroughly
'approve. it i could take a red pencil and
-write in “punishment" in places where he
used “negative reinforcement” I would
find the article more accurate. but I'd
rather expand on his analysis than exr
tinguish it

* ll grades are conceived 'oi as rein-
'torc’ers. then some grades tsay an A) are
'p‘ositive reinforcers while others (say. an
'F) are punishers. The classification
-scheme is relative to the individual. 1 know
some students who find a c punishing.
‘others who consider a C a positive reins
iorcer. Relativity aside. Owen was cor-
rect when he asserted that behavioral
‘psychologists prefer positive reiniorcc-
ment to punishment as a tactic lor training
‘behaviur. Punishment produces unwanted
side effects. Often it produces feelings of

helplessness that sap a person of the
motivation to act. lf punishment is not an
attractive learning procedure. then what
would happen it we eliminated a punishing
grade like an F? The elimination of
punishing grades was proposed by Owen.
who suggested an ABC system as a transi-
tional grading scheme on the way to the
elimination oi grades.

The removal of the 1“ grade has two
undesirable effects. First. the lowest re-
maining grade will acquire the
undesirable properties now associated
with an r, in some graduate schools
students are graded on an ABC system.
Students who regularly earn a c are asked
to leave the program. The lowest grade in
any system will always be aversive. Se-
cond. the elimination of failure leads to
some bizarre behavior. I attended
graduate school at a university that had

eliminated the l“ grade ior freshman. The
result vtas the some students who had a C
or D lll a course purposely tailed the final
exam so that their I) grades turned to F
and disappeared, The F grade was
reinstated.

Ii an ABC system is un‘ ccptablc.
perhaps we should consider the proposal to
do away with grading Owen advocated
such a prom al. and his statements in this
regard were anticipated in an earlier arti-
cle by Cindy olsher iNov loi. Both
authors find intrinsically motivated
students more acceptablc than cxtrinsicai-
ly motivated students. SO do I. But 1 have

for the real thing“

some opinions about intrinsic motivation
that lead me to expect to see instrinsic
motivation in all students all the time.

Intrinsic motivation is thought to be pre‘
sent when you hehave for no obvious extel‘;
nal reward It is related in the
psychological literature to competencei
mastery. and the need to achieve Most
people consider it to be desirable it is u‘
mistake however. to imagine a world i
which everyone is intrinsically motivated
all the time. 1 believe that intrinsic motivai
tion is situational. Some people like
literature Courses but not math courses?
Some people like science but not art and
so on it' is unreasonable to expect someone
to be interested in everything. '1 hereiore. l.
believe that everyone needs cxtr-rnsic
rewards to motivate their behavior in:
some situation.

My opinion that everyone needs extrin-
sic rewards resis on the assumption that
people undertake tasks that they do not
wish to undertake and find themselves int
situations where they do not wish to be. A
possible reply is to suggest that we let peo-
ple do what they wish. it a student wishes
to take nothing but psychology courses let
her do it. Unfortunately. this suggestion.
opposes one goal or the Grinnell education.
namely. breadth. 'lhe issue of instrinslct
motivation lS a curious one not only
because it relates to the curl ent discussion

and its homely stepchild. the required our
rlculum. Our dedication to the ideal of ti -
broad education means that students will
find themselves in courses for which they ‘
have no Intrinsic motivation. The en-
cnuragement of a broad education poses a
problem in that it lends itself more easily ;
