THIRD OF A SERIES
AGAN Discussion Circle, the
P Latter—Day SaintStudent As-
sociation and the Christian
Science Organization are proﬁled in
this ﬁnal segment of our religious
organizations series. They exem-
plify the diversity of the groups
present in Grinnell and the similarity
in their goals: education, conlmunity
and worship.

The Pagans’ presence on cam-
pus is well known, to say the very
least. Unfortunately, the group is
plagued by far-fetched, highly ere»
ative rumors, they said. For instance,
at the Pagan Discussion Circle 1 at»
tended no chickens were sacriﬁced.
No one danced nude around the

Zirkle, Members ofthe Pagan group
tend to laugh offthese types ofeom»
ments, but they are typical of the
misunderstanding that most students
have concerning the group.

First yearJanet Barkauskas, one
member of the discussion circle, ex
plained that for herPaganism is “the
worship of things that are beautiful.
That’s very vague, and it's supposed
to be."

“The sacred is what you see
around you," said ﬁrst year Emily
Groff, another member. Each person
haslheirown beliefs,allofwhleh are
incorporated in theterrn “Paganism."
Most members expressed a belief in
“the interconnectedness" of things
and that life is beautiful.

Paganism is “an open and ae-
cepting group of religions." said

Pagan Discussion Circle, held at
7:00 pm. every Thursday in Steiner
305, allows members to share and
explore their beliefs. Pagan rituals
and texts are discussed in the context
of what they represent and can pro-
vide forezieh person. A“rezidinglist"

 

is available by fingering [PAGAN].

Fulureplans.such aspublicritu-
als and purchasing texts, are also
discussed at the meetings. Everyone
is welcome at the discussion groups
and, ofcourse, tltepublicrituals, they
said. “Part of [meetings and rituals]
is to raise awareness and educate,”
explained Grinncll resrdent Mariar
Louise McCarthy, who leads the
group discussion.

Junior Nada Diordjevic added
that their only requirement is that
“we expect people to be respectful."

The Latter—Day
Saint Student
Association

“There is a group ofus who go to
church every Sunday in Newton,"
said sophomore Jen Johnson, meme
ber of the Latter-Day Saint Student
Association (LDSSA). The group of
students, whose number was de
scribed as “acar load," organized the
LDSSA this Semester.

Members of the Church of Eat-
ter-Day Saints, also known as the
Mormons, are a branch of Christiane
ity. They hold the basic beliefs of
Christianity and additionall believe

will stop drinking when they vomit or
pass out. Marijuana inhibits a person
from vomiting, thus making that per
son able to drink more. he said. Also,
marijuana use is an intoxicant which
impairs motor skills, he said.

What are the administration and
police doing about the alleged drug
problem? Krohn stressed that
Grinnell College operates under ti
policy or self governance, “When
information is brought to us [about
drug dealing and drug use], we do
deal with it. Information on the sell-
ers of drugs is turned over to the
police," Shealsoexplainedthatwhen
the administration receives tips about
the selling and using of drugs on
campus, the case is often given to the
Alcohol and Drug Hearing Board.

“Every student on campus has
the right to the besteducation Grinnell
College can give them," Oster said.
“They have the right to a ‘smoke

in the legitimacy of The Book of
Mormon.

The Book ofMormwl chronicles
the teachings of Christ to Native
Americans after his resurrection in
Jerusalem. The bookincludes expla-
nations ofthe rise and {all ofcivilizar
lions from 600 B.C. to 400 AD. and
the teachings of various prophets,
including Mormon, who were nicmr
bers of Native American tribes.

The teachings of Christ in
America closely follow those of The
New Testament, “They are almost
exactly the same its the Semion on
the Mount," said Johnson.

Mormons also believe that alco-
hol, coffee. tea. tobacco and other
harmful substances should iiol be
taken into the body. “That conﬂicts
withmostofGrinnell,”saidJohnson.

Bi-weekly meetings are held to
study The Book ofMomtun, which is
distributed to anyone interested in it
Additionally, members watch a sat-
ellite broadcast the ﬁrst day ofevery
month during which leaders of the
church speak about topics such as
church history and faith. The broad
cast is specifically aimed at “college
age, young adults," said Johnson.

The Christian
Science
Organization

The Christian Science Organir
zation is another of the smaller reli-
gious groups on campus. First year
Freyja Hartzell explained that Chris—
tian Science “diverges from other
Christian groups in that we believe in
solely spiritual healing."

This refusal to use medicine is
whatChristlanScicnceismostknown
for. “Jesus healed through God,"
said Harizell, “That's not athina that
frec’ environment." According to
Osler, most cases of drug use at the
college are handledinternally, which
is technically illegal. Despite the
college’shandlingofmostdrugcases,
Oster said that the police will follow
up on lips they receive.

cal healing takes place as members
become closerto God and use God’s
power in their daily lives, she ex
plained.

In addition to The Bible, Science

tures, written by Mary Baker Eddy,
is the main text used by Christian
Scientists, Sience and HmlIIi Wit/l
Kayla/he Scriptures focuses oli“how
to use God’s truth in daily life," ex-
plained Harlzell. This includes not
only use in physical healing, but also
in such common things as relationr

Hartzell. “It’s kind of difﬁcult in an

being taken over by methamphetamine,

available in Grinnell. Use of this drug is
more popular in town than on campus,
