Dibble's Return
Boosis Hopes
For League Win

Trying to salvage a little
prestige from an already dis-
astrous basketball season, the
Grinncll pioneers will take on
Knox tomorrow at 8 pm. in
Darby gym.

The Galesbu boys, with a
3‘1 league record, are the only
team in the conference with a
Chance,to tie the rampaging
Knights of Carleton. undefeated
in league play. Old Siwash is
currently holding down second
place in the conference,

The Pioneers, with a rather
forlorn 14, are in an excellent
position to upset Knox, as they
need an undefeated conference
season from here on in to gain
the much coveted first place tie.

A happy hit of news in the
otherwise dismal basketball
picture is the recent an-
nouncement that Harvey
Golden and Bob Dibble will
he out for the game tomor-
row night,

Dibble, who lettered last year,
is iust what the doctor ordered
for the ailing Pioneers. Bob has
been forced to sit out the sea»
son thus far because of a stem
ach ailment. but pending a r
port from the hospital, he'll be
out there Saturday night,

Coach John Ffitsch, suffering
all year from a severe lack of
outstanding guards, indicated
the diminutive Bob will see
considerable service, despite the
fact he has only been practice
ing for a week,

Even these
make the game picture bright.
Despite an alarming lack of
height, the Gelesburg crew

managed to defeat Ripon, Coe.
and Monmouth in conference
play, and lost only to Lawrence.
The Pioneers have been beaten
by Ripon, Lawrence, Monmouth,
and Carleton, and have defeated
Coe for their lone conference
victory.

The Knox lioopstcrs feature
two scorers in the top seven
of the Midwest conference.
Dean Miller, 5'10" senior
guard, is currently sporting a
16 point average, while Berk
,Johnson, an all~conference
selection last year, will carry
a 14 point average into the
game.

Other Knox starters will be
Bill Culbertson. 6’ freshman,
Robert Hill, 5'11" junior, and
Clyde Hanksl, 6’2” senior.

For Grinnell, it will be the
same story: Bob winter, Dave
Stumbaugh, Gardiner Dutton,
Doug Freyder, and Bud Crowl,
with plenty of substitutions.
And maybe that one lonesome
Pioneer strength, lots of depth,
can turn the tide and send the
01d Siwash boys home without
the expected victory. Especialr
1y with Bob Dibble in there.

Halftime entertainment will
be a demonstration on the par-
allel bars with lrwin Simone in
charge.

Paul Friend, Langan sopho—
more, took over as sports editor
of the 5&8 this week. He is re-
placing Mack Wright, Langan
senior, who has held the posi-
tion since January, 1951.

No appointment has been
made to replace Bruce Cole,
Cowles junior, as associate edi-
car.

.he entered the Illinois college.

Seek Revenge '

For Trouncing ‘
In Firs’r Game

Grinncll’s game cagers will
be out to avenge a previous dc-i
feat at the hands of Monmouth
when they meet the Scots. Sat-
urday, Feb. 2, in Darby gym
,Coach John Pfitsch’s charges
havc come a long way smcel
their 72.59 defeat at the handsl
of the lllinois hoopsters before,
Christmas vacation. The Scarlet
and Black will be aided by the;
return of Bob Dibble and some
valuable experience the rest of
thc team has picked up sincei
their first encounter with thEl
Scots. .

Bobby Woll, dean of the ‘

Midwest conierence coaches, l
will bring along a fast squad l
that centers around rote Ko— ,
vacs, presently sceond among 5
conference scoring leaders. I
Freshman Kovacs, who netted i
31 markers against Grinnell l
in their first meeting, appears i
to he the man to watch, l

Woll is noted for his final
fighting teams and this year’s‘
edition is no exception. Besides
Kovacs, Monmouth has two
other standouts in Dick Bruch‘
and Jim Young. l
Bruch, one of the team’s lead»
ing scorers last year, will holdl
down a starting forward berth;
against the Pioneers. Young is,
presently seventh in the cons
ierence scoring race. A great
sophomore prospect, Jim
brought with him the Mon-
mouth high school record of‘
42l points In one season when

The ScotePioncer
promises to be :I real battle
since Grinnell’s 1-4 record '
isn’t much worse than the
, Monmouth’s 2-4 in conference
play.

Potentially the Pioneers are
as good_ as any team in the
conference. This year's Grim-tell
squad is young and hasn't plays
ed together long enough to ful-
fill their potential. Perhaps the
most improved player is Dave
Stumbaugh, who seems to have.

Harvey Goldcn, Dibble B ace,
turned in the most spectacular.
scoring exhibition in 17 years of‘
men’s intramural basketball;
competition Monday, as \ he‘
dumped in an astounding to
points to lead his mates in an
81-21 rout of south Younker's
hapless clan.

The 81 markers amassed by
Golden and company also top~
ped the previous team high of
59 set by a l943 Rawson outfit.

Dihble's A squad ran head-
on into uncxpected trouble,
however, and needed a last
quarter rally to squeeze by
south Younkcr 29-26, Don
nott caused most of Dibble‘s l
headaches by sinking 18 l
points. ,

Dibble was knocked from the
unbeaten list last night as Gates
B team stopped the northern
hall 25—20. Ray Slanderwick’s
nine markers led the winners.
Dibble definitely felt the loss of
Golden.

in the A game, Dibble evened_
the score with a thrilling last
minute 3682 win, Bernie Mal-
donado scored it points for the
victors, while Jim Kingland‘
sunk a like total for Gates. .,

Cowles tied Dibble for first‘
place by taking two games

from Langan in the earlier cons ‘

tests. in spite of Thompson's 14

points, the Cowles A team woril

28-20. Mike Litka led the win—
ners with 12 markers. in the B
game. the even balanced Cowles
squad triumphed 40723.

in Monday's other games,‘
Cowles dropped from the uric
beaten list as Clark’s B won an
overtime contest 27—24. Cowles"
A eked out a slim 21.19 decir
sion in the other match.

i header,

On the following day, tradi-
tional rivals north and south
Younker split their double-
with the Yankees loss
ing by a slim and margin in
the A tilt.

in the 5 game, however,
North tore through the Rebels
much like Sherman's historic
rampage through Georgia in the
Civil war. "General Sherman"
was Neale Kelley, whose 24
points paced the Northern
troops to a 58-30 win and tied
the second high single game
scoring mark of the year set
earlier in the evening by Lang—
an’s Jim Thompson.

Langtm’s Lions growled
fiercely at Rawstm’s A team
and grabbed o 38-20 triumph
mainly on the work of
Thompson. One look at “Tera
rible" Terry Ellis and com-
pany turned the big cats into
kittens however, and now-
son's n squad ran away from
Langan 47-14, Ellis tallied 21.
