Qﬁhitutiul

it seems to be a invorite theme
wirh the students this iall to remark
about that dead atmosphere which
surrounds all the College activities
this year. But this state is soon
doomed to pass away and on Wednes
day evening the old spirit will be
revived and a new lease on liie taken.
Grri nnellhus one oi the best ioothall
teams in the history oi the institution
and one which deserves the support
or every student. Drake isaworthy
toe and our best edorts will be de.
m anded to win the third straight vies
tory. The Old Chapel on Wednesday

will be the scene ofagoud old fash-
ioned mass meeting. Everybody is

invited.
——..—

All old students remember the
enective work that was done by the
band last year. On many athletic
occasions the_presence or the baud
added much to the success of the
game from the stand point. of en-
thusiasm and attendance. A repre—
sentative or the band claims that they
are ready to organize again this year
but have ialled thus iar to receive the
necessary support irohi the athletic
authorities in particular. ‘All the
students iavor having a band; the
men are ready to organize and practice
it they receive the proper support.
We cannotsee butthatthe band has
often been worth many times to the
athletic union what their own price
or admission would amount to. Let's
haveshand. We need it to rnaho

the n mes game a proper success.

The long expected state Meet cup
has arrived and has been placed in
the honutiiul trophy case in the read-
ingioorn at. the library. it is an es-
cellent specimen of the Jeweler‘s Art
and is, indeed, an obiect of interest
and admiration to every college men
and human We believe that one
suggestion is in order in regard to the
location or the trophy ease. Many be-
lievethat it would be better placed
at the south end oi the hall opposite
the lihl'al'liiu‘s desk. Visitors at the
library never see the case in its pre-
sent location and a student even
hesitues to take rrienrls into the
reading room to examine the case on
accouunuf the disturbance it causes.
Tlile tine collection oi trophies and
banners is something that every vlsl-
tor at the college ought to see and
they should he placed where they may
be seen wlthout undue disturbance to
those in the study room.
