Deb Sondall ‘00 and Erin
Brandel ’00 applied to be the
editors or the GririnrllRtuielu last
spring, berore they heard from the
student Publications And Radio
Committee (SI’ARC) that there
would be only one campus liierary
magazine; the Frz'elmtul Press was
to be subsumed by the anoint/l
Renew, and their jobs might be
different than what they had
originally expected. In the past, the
Grinnell Rn/irru was organized by
oneor two editors who oversaw
the prose, poetry and art
committees and each had a
chairperson. it was published only
once a year, The Fl'rlhmid'l’rrtr was
a quarterly, and, as Sondall
explained, “had a twoetier
organization with committees and
a board." The format of the
magazines wele<different too.
“Before, the Grinm/l Review has
been full eight by eleven and thin,
and the Free/sorted Press has been
halrthat size and stapled."

When asked about content
differences between the two
magazines. Erandcl sai There
has been more poetry in the
Freehand Press." Sondall, who was
the Crinmlan/irw prose chair last
year and on their committee hei
sophomore year, attributed this
tendency to the length of the
magazines. “The 80 to 100 pages
(of the Grinnzll Rcoiew) allows
more for longer
Submissions." Brande], who has
more experience with the Freeland
Putt, recounts the stress created by
the frequency of publication. “In
the past, the Frtrlmml press has
been pretty siressru1,,coming out
four times a year. but also
rewarding to see people pick it up,
read ir, talk about it and to see the
submissions get better throughout
the year.” When asked how she felt
about he merger, Erin replied, “I
feel more comfortable with it

Jon Stob '00, the co-cditor of .

the Free/mid Press for the fall ’98,

recounts that the Free/Mild press ‘

was going through
“particularly tough times," even
during her involvement and that
her co.ediror :‘liad talked about
dissolvingitorhavingitconie out
hiannually. . . SPARC was having
incredible financial and
organizational problems.“ She
remembers being contronrcd with
cut-back requests as a result of
SPARC’S ovenbudgetting. Said
Stob, “We were like, ‘No, we can't
cut back. We gave you a budget for
what need, didn‘t
exaggerate.” Despite the
inconvenience, she understood the
position that SPARC was in. "I
have so much respect for the
students on SPARC, because it is
incredibly hard to bc fully—enrolled
academically and turning out a
publication.” ‘

When asked about the merger
between the Free/rend P751: and the
GrinntllRei/itw, Stob said that she
has mixed feelings: “I think it did
have a place in the writer’s
community." She remembers the
creative fervor of the Free/mod
Freestyle, the zinerlikc creation that
guaranteed each submitter at least

When asked to explain, Stoi

Frat/mud Press, “that we'd publish
only the work oirhe peopleon our

complicated the usual stress of
soliciting submissions

in comment to the SPARC
decision, Brandel says, “The
Grinnell Review was the original
literary magazine on campus and
tlic Free/mad prep started out by
publishing everything that it got
to push the creative community on
campus.“ Brandel maintains that
the Free/nine Press strayed away
from that original mentality and

. that the two publications had

grown similar. Sondall attributed
the decision for merger to
SPARC'S realization "that there
weren’t a lor ordirrerence between
the two” and that “budget was
probably a concern too, . . Why
not have one magazine that does
it really well’"

Currently, Sondall and Brandel
are busy deciding just what the
new Grinnell Review will be like
this year Their shared job is to
solicit submissions, mediate
meetings or submissionyrcvicw
committees, and organize the
layouta “We are planning to do
publication events like student
readings or trips to iowa City to
attend poetry readings," added
Sondall. “We also meet with the
printer and do budget business."
Btandel explained that they are
trying to merge the styles of the
two previous magazines, ”changing
both how it looks and the
submission processes" This year
they eliminated the chair positions
and reworked the three
committees into two: writing and
art, According to Sondall, “liyou
have the same people reviewing the
prose and the poetryyou get more
of a sense or the whole of

Also, sondall added, “we're
trying to get a lot more art."

Two Films From Eastern Europe

Pretty Villages, Pretty Flames
(Thursday Night Movie Madness,
Sept. 23, 10 p.rn. @Gardn’er)

When I Wcm to high school in
Belgrade, there was a very popular
song played at all the parties that
went: “All onugoslavia’s dancing
rock’n’rolln." Hearing it some 25
minutes into Pray Villager, l’mg
Flames, makes me feel at once
nostalgic about places and times
past, and also suddenly very old.
In this Serbian film, th: rock
music pounds on while pretty
villages burn in the background
and a soldier plays a video game
in the darkness.

pretty Villagtr, Pretty Home is the
second selection for this year’s
Thursday Night Movie Madness
(formerly Tuesday Night Movie
Madness), and it is representative
of the wackincss that is to bc
expected from Grinncll‘s famous/
notorious alternative film vcnue.
As summed up by one Belgrade
critic, ”This is not Eastern
European art-house stuff...This IS
real cinema." Pretty Villages, Pretty
Flame: is 2 brilliant film that is a
cry from the soul of a mortally
wounded people, and like life in
the Balkans itself, the film is
brutal, uncompromising, bold,
and yet wildly hilarious,

min Flamr: was a major award
winner at fcstivals worldwide in
1996, but there were places that
declined to screen it on the
grounds that it was fascist (simply
because it is Serbian). Made with
$2 million provided in part by
Serbian Ministry orculture, who
then boycotted it, the ﬁlm topped

success at home is especially

signiﬁcant in light orits criticism
of the present vulgarity ofSerbian
nationalism, We see young men
who, after hearing bombastic
specches, volunteer to fight in the
War, buying on the street
nationalist insignia that they
proudly pin on their uniforms.
The two central characters are
Halil, a Muslim, and Milan, 3
Serb. In the 80’s, they grew up as
best friends in an idyllic mountain
village in Bosnia, near
nBrotherhood and Unity'Y tunnel
that was built as part of the
railroad to connect Belgrade and
Zagreb. As kids, they never dare
go inside the tunnel, fearing a
monster inside, believing that “if
he wakes up, he’ll eat up the village
and set the house: on fire.”

Flash forward, 12 years later: “Will
there be a war?" wonders Halli.
“What war?" replies Milan, as they
sit in a sunny roadside care on top
ofa mountain. But in reality, the
demon of hatred is already wide
awake in people's souls, and when
Milan, along with a battalion of
Serb soldiers, is trapped inside [he

Seen & Heard

By Hung Phom
ASrEEdiior

Do you have a favorite song? I sure as hell do.

its a lazy weekday aﬁcrnoon. I’m in my friend’s room talking to a couple
ofpals. Wc'rcshooting the breeze, and our conversation, as it so often does,
turns to sex. My rriend has just ﬁnished telling me that anyone thatwho ran
his hand through her hair the right way could “have his way" with her, I
laugh ar her silly statement (hoping that she's lust joking), when she turns to
me and asks me what someone would have to do to “have their way with
me.” After some deliberation, I say (only halfin lest), ”Anyoncwho tells me
they like the Sundays can have her way with me.” My friends, fully aware of
my infatuation with die band, laugh at me and move on to the next topic.
But like 1 said, I was only halrioking. What i really meant to saywas, “Anyone
who lam ihe Sundays, " and what I really, really meant to say was, "Anyone
who loves the song ‘Hcrc’s Where the Story Ends’,"

I can remember the ﬁrst time I heard "Here's Where the Story Ends". I’m
sophomore in high school, The house is quiet. I’m in the kitchen, headphones
on, doing my home work. Then it hits me. First the pleasant, strummy
guitars. And then tht verse. The perfect pitch, ﬁlled with sadness, sincerity,
and Wistfulness, singing about “little souvenirs" and “terrible years," it was
strange, haunting, and my God it was beautiful. When the song ended, i
was a goner. I didn’t feel like doing much of anything. deﬁnitely not
homework. I got up, walked to the living and plunked down on the couch.
1 remember continuing to listen to the radio, hoping that the D] would rell
me the name or that ring. Ofcoursc, that would have been too easy, and
nothing this important comes easily.

i spent the next couple of days asking friends if they knew that song
about “a story ending, or something” (I didn’t know that the song came out
in 1990, and was being played as a ﬂashback). Ofcoursc, their usual reaction
was to ask, “How does it go?" So, in my best soprano, I sang the song as best
I could. but sufﬁce to say, my rendition didn’t stir any memories. Thwarted
again. .

but, ahh, God bless the internct. The duct tape ofthc 90's, After a couple
orsearehes, i found that some band called the Sundays had a song called
“Here's Where the Story Ends." I bought it the next day.

i can talk for hours about why I love this song, but I can never really
explain it, Everything about it resonates with me First, the music sets the
mood perfcclly, carrying the listener to the English countryside on a cold
autumn day. Then, there are the perfect lyrics, unfolding its story like a
diary; the lines feel like pointless remembrances that mean the world to the
one who remembers: “its that little souvenir oia terrible year that makes my
eyes reel sore/And i never should have said rhe books that you read were all
I loved you for," All this wrapped around perhaps the truest voice l've ever
heard, that oil-iarriei Wheeler. For me, “Here's Where the story Ends” is 4
minutes ormusieal nirvana.

I‘m always trying (like I am now) to explain to others why I love this song
so much. But it rarelyworks. When i play the song for other people, i usually
just get polite smiles and diplomatic comments like, “Yeah, that was a nice
song," No matter. All i know is that rhis song does something for me, and
probably always will. Once, I played the song day and night, while sleeping
and awake, to see ifi would grow tired orii. After playing it aweek without
tiring, i felt pretty sure that the song-was here to stay,

Favorite songs are a weird, wonderriil thing, iiist ask anyone who has one.
They bypass that part ofyour brain that listens to music, and go directly to
the part the reels music. I think everyone should have a favorite song iryou
have one, you’ll never grow tired of music, because you’ll be constantly
reminded ofthe limitless power orsong. .

ok, maybe I was exaggerating when i said that anyone who loves “"Hcrc's
Where the Story Ends!“ could have their way with me. I guess I. should
revise my statement, so here goes; lfyou were so blown away the ﬁrst time

were doing and lie down on a couch for awhile, ifyou can listen to the song
for a week straight and still love it, ifthe song rocks your world, then I will
be your love slave for life. Ycah. I know. I’m easier than 33 dollar whore. J
