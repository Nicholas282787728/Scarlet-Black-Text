NEW DRGANIZATIDN WELDDMED

Fills Long‘vFelt Need for GirLi
Not Members of Other Lit.
era/ry Societies.

STEP TAKEN LAST FRIDAY

With the organization of a
new women's society, “Aegis," n
great. torwnrd step was taken to
wards broadening and enriching Grin-
nell life, and at the same time pro-
viding an opportunity lor more inﬁi~
vidual culture for the women of Grin—
nell. Th2 new society starts out with
a membership oi ﬁfteen.

The need of a new Girls’ society has
long been tell. The 011:1 socictles have
1101 been large enough to accommw
dale all the girls. so they are accused
of .1 luck of democracy. The only solu-
lien for 1111s state or aimlrs seemed to
be in the iormation of another society,
so a small company or girls have up
dorldkcn the dilrlcnllics of organizo—
lion.

Choose “Aegis“ as Name.

Aegis ms the name decided upon by
Llle ﬁttccn cllnrtel 1ne1nbcis.1n Greek
mythology the 'Aegis" was the shield
given by Zeus to Alhena. Aegis has
come to signin any protecting Inﬂu~
ence or power, and symbolizes, in the
Ideal o1 Athena. the slandnrd, or 1111
110111 - 1y virtues.

"Sweetness and Light.“ the mottu
chosen by the Aegis scolety, was sug-
gested by the title or linilhew Arnold’s
