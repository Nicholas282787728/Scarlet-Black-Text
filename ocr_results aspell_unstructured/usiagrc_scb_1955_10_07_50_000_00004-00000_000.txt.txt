Genial Tom Boe Is Rough
Opponents

On Grinnell’s

by Dennis Watson

Any residents of north camp.
us who get the idea that a
raid on their south campus
neighbors would be appropriate
are very likely to run into the
formidable figure of Grinnell
College senior Tom Boe, 0. ct
H. P. president and business»
econ. major from Onaiwa, Iowa.

Also anyone attempting to

penetrate the forward wall of

the Pioneer eleven is just as
art to met Mr. hoe and corn-
pany who have other ideas.

Tom isn't actually such a
rough, unsociable individual as
the oirst paragraph of this story
indicates. In reality he is a
rather easy - going conscientious
young man who has made many
close driends in his four years
at Grinnell. Tom is the second
member of the Bee family to
attend Grinnell; his siser grad-
uated here .in 1950.

Major Pastime Golf

Tom has acquired two foot-
ball letters, one track letter and
is in his third year as member
of the men‘s Honor G, In high
school he amassed a total of
fifteen letters in all of the ma-
jor sports and became quite ‘9’
terested in golf which is still
his major pastime. . .

Commenting on this years
football team Tom says,

“There's especially good spirit
on the team. . ,the fellas
want to play ball and it's as
good a team as I‘ve seen here
since I came. . .the ireshrnan
team this year is by far the
best We seen and should add
some good men to the squad
next you”.

Tom made special note of the
fact that in all sports everyone
gets an ,equal chance no mat~
ter what past experience they've

had. Tom admits that the grid
team’s first two starts weren’t
too sparkling but they were
against extremely rough center-
ence competition.

Active in Music

As to the future Tom is un-
certain at the present. He is an
advanced AFROTC student and
incidentaly group commander or
the unit here. Whether it will
be graduate school or the air
force first has not lbeen settled
as of yet.

The husky South Younker
senior's other extracurricular ace
tivities include four years of
men's glee club and choir,

Unbeaiell Carleton,
Si. Olaf Clash In
Week's Big liame

by Special Dispatch

The stage is Set this Satur-
day for a show-down between
two of the three undefeated
Midwest conference teams,
Carleton and St. Olaf. This past
Saturday Carleton continued the
defense of its title by winning
its third straight ot the season
and its eleventh over two sea-
sons at Monmouth, 33-0. St.
Olaf was even more impressive
in crushing previously umbeab
en Ripon 52-12.

Coe, the third undefeated
team, will travel to Ripon to
try to avenge last year’s 14-12
upset. Coe downed Loras 23—12
last Saturday in a non-Confer-
ence fill-in that took the place
of the CoeeLawrenCe game.

Northfield, Minn., the home-
town ol both colleges, could
hardly have a more dramatic
setting. Not only will the game
have an important bearing on
the championship, but it will
also be the 34th grid meeting of
two old rivals. Carleton has
won 21, st. Olaf ll, and there
has been one tie.

Last year. Carleton came from
behind to upset St. Olaf 14.13.
This was the Olcs’ only loss,
although two ties also marred
their record. The game is stride
1y a toss»up. Both have power-
ful lines and versatile lback-

'fields.

Cornell Darkhoxse

Cornell, which topped Knox
26-14 last Saturday, will be host
to hapless Monmouth, which has
been badly hit by injuries. Cor.
nell should win this one and
thereby stay within striking dis-
tance of the leaders.

G . nell, which was idle last
week, will travel to Lawrence
for the opening of the Vikings’
polio-shortened season. Law-
rence will be at a considerable
disadvantage. having had only‘
two weeks of practice, but
should still give Grinnell some
real competition. Lawrence's
games will not count in the con-‘
ference standings this season.

Grinnell is fresh from a
19-39 win over St. Olaf at
home last Saturday and will be
attempting to duplicate last
year's victory over the Vlkes?.

Lawrence lost by a 2048 count
in last fall's meeting, but re-
covered to nab third place in
the Conference meet, Just behind
the Pioneers. ,
ADoug Hagen is Lawrence‘s
big threat. He has taken second
place in conference cross-
country for the last two years.
In addition to Hagen, the vi-
klngs have two other lettermen
in Mike Simonds and Chuck
Merry.

The Scarlet squad will be
counting on the same seven men
who ran to victory in the St.
Olaf meet; George Drake, wln~
nor of themeet, Dan Ver Ploeg,
Larry Schaleger, John Weldon
and Bob Downs. Also in con-
tention will be Fritz Goreham
and Dick Shane.

Wednesday the Pioneer har-
riers ,will go against Drake here
over the golf course layout.

Frosh Cross Counlry

Under the coaching of Dave
Qutub, a standout of last year’s
cross—country team, a promis-
ing group of freshmen cuntende
ers is rounding into shape.

Squad members who look best
at the present time include Leo
Altemeier, Tom Castle. Gordie
Hunt, Ernie Sinclair, Jim Palm-
er, and Charles voak.

Taking the first three-
places, the Pioneer cross»
country contingent defeated
St. Olaf 19-39 here in the
opening meet of the season
for both teams. The contest
was run over a Shortened
course of two miles.

George Drake resumed last
year's winning ways, breaking
the tape with a time or 10 min-
utes, 19 seconds. Dan Ver Ploeg
ran second, closely followed by
Larry Schaleger in third. Drake
also won in last year’s ole meat
which Grinnell won 17-42.

St. olatf's number one man,
Larry Shaw, ruined Grinnell’s
attempt for the first live posi-
tions with a fourth place errort.
Grinnellian John Weldon capped
firth place.

Completing pioneer scoring
were Bob Downs in eighth place.
Fritz Goreham in ninth, and
