Impressionistic Dramatics

Highlight (Adding Machine’

"The action, Speech, stage set, music _ all the things that go
to make up a play —— are distorted in expressionistic drama," said

Miss Carmen Sherman, dirwtor of “The Adding Machine,” which

will be presented here next weekend.
The Elmer Rice play, the season's second offering of the college
theater, promises a unique experience to Grinnell playgoei-s. It is

the first expressionistic drama to

Expressionism is a sort of
mental eray process. It exposes
the subconscious thoughts, the
hidden yearnings. the “hinter-
land" thoughts. It is the subcon-
scious mind of the characters
that does most of the talking,
not the conscious, as in other
types of plays. They express
thoughts and ideas which, if
they were acting naturally,
would be too deep in their minds
to be brought out. The action is
jerky, mechanical, and startling.

Expressionism offers greater
opportunity to actors than most

be presented here in many years.

other types, because the empha»
sis is on characters more than
plot. *

“Expressionism is the dram-
atic form which best conveys
the illusion of reality in the pres—
ence of the obviously unreal”
said the New York Times in its
review of the original Broadway
production of "The Adding Mc—
chine" back in 1923. The show
then featured Dudley Diggs and
Helen Westley in the roles to
be played by Vernon-Voyles and
Jo Landmalrs .
