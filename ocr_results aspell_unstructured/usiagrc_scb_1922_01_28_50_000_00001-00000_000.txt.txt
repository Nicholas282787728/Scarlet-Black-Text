World Famous English Journalist
And War Correspondent Here
Monday Night, Jim. 30.

SUBJECT CHOSEN IS “THE
CHANCE FOR WORLD PEACE“

Will Speak In Herrick Chapel—
Plan Entertainment for
I Noted Guest.

Sir rhilip Gibbs, a man of inter»
national fame as author, journalist
and lecturer, is to appear on the Col-
lege lecture course in the Herrick
chapel next Monday evening in
his famous lecture, "The Chance for,
World Peace," The subject is timely
and the speaker is Specially Well
qualiﬁed to discuss it. This is one
of the headline numbers of this year's
College Lecture Course and is one
which will instantly commend itself
to all thoughtful people.

Sir Philip Gibbs is perhaps best
known through his magazine articles
and war Correspondence reports.
Thousands became familiar with his
’name and his ability following the
Balkan Wars in 1912 and during the
Great War, in his capacity of official
correspondent with the French and
British forces, he became an inter-
national tigure. it was due to his
work in this ﬁeld that he was knight-
ed by the British government,

It is said that his lecture, Chance of
World Peace, which he is to deliver
in the Congregational church, January
30. is as gripping in theme as his fa—
mous lecture on the Irish situation
last season, Coming as it does, at a
time when the world is in a‘ critical
period in the process of reconstruc-
tion, it has never failed to draw large
audiences of people who are interest—
ed in the trend of the world events be
cause their own personal happiness ls
dependent upon the welfare of nations.
In his lectures, as in his books, Sir
Philip speaks with a deep understand.
ing that reaches the hearts of the
people.

Information at First mind

since the close of the War Sir Philip
Gibbs has bad frequent interviews
with eminent statesmen and other ha,-
tiohal leaders who are directing the
course of events in Europe, He was
also accorded a special interview with
the late Pope Benedict. He saw much
that was discouraging in his trip‘
abroad, particularly in Russia, where
civilization is in 5. suite of decay, but
he believes there is hope of regenera-
tion for all countries. Sir Philip has
thus ﬁrst hand information as to con—
ditions in Europe both from abservnr
tion and Contact with eminent ﬁgures
in World affairs.

More recently this great journalist,
who has always been ardently pre-
American, and who wrote enthusias-
tically of the American troops at the
front, visited this country for the
purpose of making a careful study or
our national characteristics. The ma-
terial that he gathered enabled him
to write a series of articles that ap~
peered in some of the leading Amer»
ican and. English newspapers and
magazines.’ Later he Wrote a. hook
that has made a stir throughout the
world, People of Destiny—Americans
As 1 saw Them At Home and Abroad.
Unlike the usual books of impressions
written by English visitors to this
country, this work revealed Sir Philip
Gibbs‘ wonderful power and keen and
correct observation, ,

President and Mrs, J. H, T. Main will
he host and hostess at a formal din—
ner party in honor of Sir Philip Gibbs
Monday evening. Following the lec-

IN VALLEY LEIIBEHS

Missouri Gets Fourth Victory of
Season There Saturday—
Swre 47-19.

Missouri annexed her fourth straight
victory of the season last Saturday
night when they won from the Fion—
eers by a 47 to 19 score. The Grinnell
team started the scoring but soon
found the pace at little too hot and the
Tigers gradually took the lead which
they retained until the end of the
game.

Benz again showed his prowess in
the free throwing art by caging nine
baskets out of nine attempts for a
percentage of 100 per cent. Whitehill
proved to be’ the best scorer from the
floor by caging three field goals
against the strong Missouri defence.
Foal-ing and Macy scored one ﬁeld
goal apiece Baker showed up well
as guard but was forced to leave the
game in the last ﬁve minutes of play!

The Grmnell offensive frequently
carried the ball into Missouri ten-i»
tory but were covered so closely that
shooting was difficult, The Tigers
used their famous short pass system
and showed themselves to be masters
of this style of play. Once they gain—
ed possession of the ball and got un-
der way it seemed almost an impossi-
bility to stop the play until the hall
was under the basket. Missouri has
been developing this method of attack
for about seven years and seem to
have it now at a stage where it is
almost beyond Criticism,

Knight, the Tiger right forward,
was hrgh man in the scoring column
with eleven field goals marked up 017»
posits his name, for a total of 22
points. Bunker, Missouri, guard.
seemed to be considerably hampered
by a lame leg but was kept in thru-
out the game.

Missouri who is now the leader of
the Valley will play a return game
here next Tuesday night, Jan. 31st.
The game was originally scheduled
to come on the Sum, but was changed
in order to ﬁt in better with the Tiger
schedule,

Conference Leaders 011 Pioneer
Floor Tuesday — Squad In
Stiff Work£0uts.

The ﬁrst Missouri valley game on
the home floor will he staged on Tues-
day night when the local cage men
will meet the leaders of the confer-
ence, the Missouri Tigers, This con-
tsst is expected to be the hardest game
which the Pioneers will have on their
home schedule.

Missouri is now in first place by
virtue of having won ll'onI all of the
fastest teams of the valley and it now
seems improbable that she will be de—
deprived of the coveted position at
the head of Lhe standing column. The
short pass system at which they are
so adept has so far proved almost im-
possible to stop but it is hoped that
the Pioneers my profit by their ex~
pcriencs with the Tigers in their game
last Saturday and devise some way
of stopping llleanwell's attack .

Smith and Critcbett will undoubted-
ly strengthen the squad considerably
and with it week's time in which to
devise a defence against the Missouri
offence the local basketeers should be
able to spring a surprise on their much
vaunted antagonists. The practice for
the past week has been a grilling one
in order that the men may be well
groomed for their home season and
no alibis will be given.

A close watch will probably be kept
on Knight. the Missouri forward who
made eleven ﬁeld goals against the
Grinnell quintet when they played at
Columbia last Saturday. Coach Saun-
ders will confine most of his atten-
tion to developing a campaign against
the Tiger cohorts.

Large Audience Plea/sell With Ex-
cellent Program Presented by
French Pianist,

The large audience present at the
piano recital given by Maurice
Dumesnil in Herrick chapel inst Sat-
urday evening was delighted by the
artist’s splendid performance of a
well selected program. He proved
himself to be the excellent musician
he has been reported, his pianistic art
fulﬁlling the highest expectations or
all who heard him. His colorful
touch, artistic sensibility and power,
and ﬁnished technique all attributed
to his success.

Mr. Dumesnil demonstrated his
mastery of the key-board from the
ﬁrst. His interpretation of the Bee-
thoven Appassinnsta was character-
ized by profound, thoughtful mu-
siciansbip. The group of Chopin
numbers which followed he per-forni-
ed with a depth of feeling and mag-
netism that made them the outstand-
ing feature of the evening. Offering
an interesung contrast and showing
Mr, Dumespil's ability in another ﬁeld
of musical interpretation were the
number by Debussy and Vuillemln’s
“Carillons dan La Baie." Two bril-
liant numbers by Liszt closed the con-
cert, Mr. Dumesnll so completely held
his audience by the charm of his art-
istry that the ywere unwilling to leave
the chapel, insisting repeatedly on his
reappearance,

The battling squad from Building

honors in the Inter-dormitory series
thus far, and annexed both games in
the second round which was played
last Saturday. The third round will
be played today.

Thus far Jas. A. Smith and hangars
Halls have succeeded in taking three
out of the four games that they have
played while the Dibble Hall boys have
broken even in the series of conflicts
and football games that have been
staged on the gymnasium door. Clark
Hall and Building Four have thus far
been unsuccessful in their attempts
to annex a percentage and are at—
foot of the scoring column. All of
the games have been well fought and
some good team work has been de—
veloped. -‘

The games between Dibble Hall and
Building III have been the fastest in
the series to date, altho penalties were
frequnt on both teams. Owing to the
stellar work of "Dutch" Garner and
Herbrechtsmeyer md Dauhonberger,
the Three—ites were finally able to
deleat their only rivals in the front
rank. "

The crowds at the games are increas—
ing and the buildings are developing
some good spirit’ as the series pro—
gresses. The teams of the “A" and
"B" classes are more evenly balanc-
ed this year than lsst and ﬁghting is
hard and close. with Garner, one of

ing for varsity, the next few games
may make a change in the respective
standings.

SMITH AND BENZ STAR .
FOR GRINNELL OUTFIT

‘Squad Shows Up Well For First
M. V. Game With Missouri
Next Tuesday Night.

Grinnell completely outclassed and
defeated the Coe quintet here last
night in the first game of the season
on the local door. Throughout the
game the Pioneers were the aggrelp
sors and the Coe players succeeded
in counting only two points from the
foul line, failing to annex a single
ﬁeld goal. The game was featured by
the new style of basketball as taught
by Coach Saunders and frequent sub-
stitutions on both sides,

Benz started the scoring for Grinneli
with a field goal which was followed
a few minutes later by one from
Baker. Cl'ltchstt substituted for Bair—
er and a few moments later, Dates-
man took the place of Captain Macy.

Couple of spectacular shots by Date:-

, Many Crinnou men were given the
chance to show their ability in the
second half and succeeded not only
in holding down the Coe aggregation
but also in counting several field
goals themselves. The return of sev-
em] nlrlel men to the game put new
pep in the team and the score was in—
creased to 26. Coe obtained one free
throw in each half, the fast -'cneei-
guards foiling their attemp-s IL rr
ﬁeld goal completely.

First Game For Smith

dual star of the game while his team-

stellar ball. This was the ﬁrst game
for “Ty" Smith but the way he cov-
iercd the door was a delight to the
Grinnell fans. This was also the first
game for Critohett, who played part
of the game at forward.

With the ﬁrst home game safely
tucked away,‘ the Pioneers are bold-
ing themselves in readiness for the
second contest with Missouri, which
will be played here Tuesday evening.
. Missouri held the championship of the
lVally last year and has not lost'a
