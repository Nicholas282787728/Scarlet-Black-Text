Students Not Only ‘Teachers’ Pets’;
Grinnell Professors Fond of Dogs

Blagg Exception to Ru18;.

Zoologist Prefers
Turtle, Tload

By Staff Writer

In an age when college professors
are supposed to be entirely without
sentiment and human qllaliLiCs, it is
gratifying to find that they are not
above having a fondness for dogs The
latter fact is prored by thc number
of Grinncll professors who possess
dogs to which they are devoted,

Some give their dogs free rein, al-
lowing them to roam the streets at
any time. while others keep their pets
shut up, but all alike seem to think
a great deal of the dogs.

Blagg lieeps Toad, Turtle

Not all faculty members prefer
dogs as pets, Elizabeth Blagg in-
structor in zoology, having a urtle
and a toad, but it would seem that
she is merely the exception proving
the rule. At any rate, her fellow in-
structors, who incline toward keep.
ing animals, choose dogs for pets.

The breeds of these animals extend
all the way from Prof. Milton Witts
ler‘s Boston terrier, Pard. shipped all
the way from Seattle, to Prof. Earl
D. Strong's perennial favorite, Bus»
ter, a mongrel of extremely uncertain
lineage.

More Tolerant to Dogs

The most striking example of the
way in which faculty members re-
gard their dogs is that of Jesse L.
Fellows. It is commonly known that
Mr. Fellows is not exactly tolerant
of the damage done to the buildings
or grounds by students. Far from it:
hi ire is to be dieaded by the hapless
ones who cross him. However, his
airdale recently tore up a hat belong~
ing to Mrs. Fellows, and that wari-y
guardian of these buildings thought
nothing of it.

Perhaps the most pampered cam-
pus dog is Peter, a wire-haired te -
rier owned by Edward B. T. Spencer,
genial and witty professor of Greek.
Peter has complete run of the Spen.

sible element of romance and mystery i

an adventuress, with an unusual-
amount of expression in her eyes, but

tempts to roam.

Stoops Prize Dog Lover

The prize dog lover of the faculty
is Prof J. D. Stoops, who has two
pomei-anians, Betty and Fachita, with
one of whom he may be seen roam~
ing about, for faculty dogs are no difs
ferent from ordinary dogs, They must
have their exercise.

Fl'ofessor Stoops recently presented
himself as a candidate for a heroism
medal, by offering a nightly haven of
refuge to the notorious canine, Alto,
persistant Nemesis of local motorists,
who recently created a sensation by
disappearing for a time, and then re»
turning to his old haunts much to the
discomfort of automobile drivers of
this locality.

Brown Talks

Speaks on Gandhi, India’s
Fight for Freedom

“Passive rcsistanee and economic
boycott are two powerful weapons
which India uses against England,"
stated Manuel Biown, ci-innell sophos
more. in a talk before the Woi lei-s'
Cooperative college Wednesday eve-
ning, “Gandhi and Indla‘s Fight for
Freedom,” was the subject of his ad-
dress.

200 Languages, Dialects

Because of the many religions and
the fact that there are over 200 lan-

guages and dialects spoken in India,

the people of India are not united,
said Mr Brown. Since the year 1600
the B sh have dominated India and
along with cxploitations have improv-
ed conditions greatly by building
schools, hospitals, railroads and insti-
tutions wide spread methods of sonic
tation.

If England were to give India her
freedom, it would mean the losing of
India's trade. By this trade is meantl
the goods which England exports to
her subjects and forces her to buy.

Gandhi—“Messiah"

Gandhi is believed by many to be
the Hindu Messiah and indeed Gandhi
himself believes this is true, said Mr.

lBIown. He is advocating freedom for

India, but it is anegative freedom in
that he docs not designate any special
social plans for India. It may be noted
that the Hindus use passive resistance
instead of armed conflict, for their
religion forbids bloodshed amongst
humans and animals. This attitude of
passive resistance along with eco-

I‘uouiic boycott collJtlLllLes
