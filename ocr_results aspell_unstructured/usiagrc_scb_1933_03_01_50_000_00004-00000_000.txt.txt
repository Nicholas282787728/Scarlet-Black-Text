Second Iowa State Match
Scheduled Slatui'rday

With a string of four victories to
its credit, the Grinnell college swim-
ming team will meet the Iowa state
college mermen in a return meet at
the local swimming pool, Saturday
afternoon, starting at 3 o'clock.

In a recent meet at Ames, Coach
Elton Rosen’s men took five of the
nine first places, and scored a 46-38i
Victory over the Big Six champions.
In doing so Clark Elbert upset the
dope by defeating Sands of .Iuwa
State, in the 200 yard breast stroke.
Sands holds the state record in that
event. Zimmerman of Iowa State is
a graceful diver and will be expected‘
to repeat his victory when the teams
meet Saturday.

coach Elton Rosen's swimming
Learn scored its fourth swimming vic-
tory of the season last Saturday night
by defeating the Nebraska university
tankstcr-s 49 to 35 at the Grinnell
college pool

The Grinnell swimmers won seven
out of the nine first places in the
meet herc Saturday, losing only the
loo-yard freestyle and the son-yard
medley relay. Clark Elbert won first
places in the zuoeyard breast-stroke,
first in the «toeyni-d swim breaking
the pool mark, and second place in
the 220-yard freestyle to rank as
highpoint man tor the evening.

Dave Mallirougii accounted tor two
first places and broke the pool rece
ord for the 220Ayard freestyle, Adams
also tied his pool record in the '60-

,shalltown junior college five.

An announcement from Drake uni-
versity states that Charles “Chuck”
Hoyt, iorrner Grinnell student, and
one of the fastest sprinters in the
world at his time, has been selected
to referee the twentyrfourth annual
Drake Relays to be held at Des
Morncs, April 28 and 29, Hoyt is
now track coach at the University of
Michigan.

We found, while browsing
through 1916 editions of the Scar-
let and Black, that an optimistic
nttituda prevailed regarding
Hoyt's career with the Pioneers.
Numerous streamers read, “SEE
HOY‘I‘ WIN THE 100 AND THE
220 [N THE STATE h
As it ,liappcried Hoyt broke the
world record M. the Broke relays
with it mark of 21.4 seconds for
the 220 yard dsuh. His best time
tor the century us 9.3 seconds,
but he duplicated this on many
occasions, During his career at
Greenfield, 1a., high school and
at Grinncil college, he was unilce
footed in the 220, and llzls rc-
ceived nearly 100 awards tor his
prowess.

Even though his swrmmers razz him
for being so good-looking, it seems to
us that Coach Elton Rosen must have
plenty of coaching control over them,
and with four fairly decisive wins be-
hind him, we consider there is reason
to feel rather proud. 'There has been
considerable rurnor regarding the dis-
posal of swimming as inter-collegiate
sport for Griunell college next season.

Park’s F its! Malteaser
Features Technocracy

By hlrdcom Thompson

Making its first appearance under
its new editor, King Park, the Mal-
tenser, Grinnell monthly humor mage
azine, appeared Saturday in a new
guise. The traditional figure of Malty,
the grinning campus cet, fails to
adorn the cover; in MalLy's place in
a drawing by the new editor. carry-
ing out the theme of the March issue,
that of technoci-acy.

Technocracy, the craze which swept
America in January, about which
everyone was talking, and which no
one understood, constitutes the dom-
inant motif of Editor Park's first
production, and comes in for a full
share of ridicule. Antiquated pictures,
reminiscent of “Ballyhoo”, more mod-
ernsketches, and articles one Com~
bined to place technocracy in the an
surd light in which it is now com-
monly regarded.
