How to
do some
science

How to grow
an intermetallic
LaCrGe crystal

O Take about a gram
of Lanthanum, a
gram of Chromium
and a gram of Ger-
manium. Chop into
itty bitty pieces
using a boltcutter.

Melt your metal
chunks together
using an arc melter,
which will heat
your sample up to a
couple thousand de—
grees Celsius with a
miniature lightning
bolt. Flip sample
(without opening
bell jar) and repeat
until evenly done.
Chop up resulting
limp and place in a
small crucible.

Take a quartz tube
and stuff in a small
wad of quartz wool
(stuff that looks a
lot like cotton but
doesn’t incinerate
at high tempera
tures). Squeeze your
crucible full of
metal chunks into
the tube. Put an-
other crucible full of
quartz wool on top
and pad with ans
other gob of quartz
wool.

Seal quartz tube
using a hydrogenv
oxygen blowtorch
(may require adult
supervision).

Place in event Set
oven to heat to
about 1600 C and
drop back down to
about 1100 C over
the course of a Few
days.

Wait for crystal to
cool.

Wait some more.

Break open quartz
tube and crucible. If
all: gone well, you
may ﬁnd tiny metals
lic structures. Enjoy.

Five spots to watch for next time you’re lost

As you wander around Noyce,
you maybe struck by the large num»
her of bizarre objects lying around.
Many orthcsc should bc approached
with caution, because you never
know if they’re sonicone’s fugitive
biology projects (though fangs or
strange antennae-like growths art: a
good sign),

However, some of these objects
are fully intended to sit out in full
view for curious and/or bored stu-
dents like yourselfzo enjoy

on your way inro
Noyce, if you’re traveling
up the west stairway to
the second ﬂoor, you may

notice aiarge object hanging above
you that looks rather precariously
suspended. In fact, it first glance, it
may look like nothing at all is keep»
ing this large array of metal from
crashing down onto your unprotects
ed cranium.

DO NOT PANIC. This is
merely the work of artist Steven
Haas. The sculpture, called Scare
rered Flight, is made from brushed
aircraft aluminum and has been
hanging since 1999 without incis
dent, so the chances of it choosing
the moment you’re beneath it to
break its apparently flimsy cord are
rather slim.

Another curio that may
confuse you at first is the
clock in rhe display case in

front ofthe Modern Phyf
ics lab. Your first thought may be to
wonder why someone would put an
ordinary, innocuous-looking clock
in a display case, Bur upon a closer
look, you will notice that this is no
ordinary clock. There are in fact
only 10 numbers on it.

This is actually a metric clock.
designed for nerds who feel that
time, like other dimensions, should
be measured in a rarionni and logical
manner and have developed an ab-
horrence of feet, pounds and other
silly English things, The caption
under this novelty aptly ieads, “An
idea ahead ofits lime."]ust don’t try
to use it to get to class.

As you are standing idly
looking at this metric clock
and possibly trying to work

out a conversion table from
metric to “real" hours in your head.
you may be unaware of the fact that,
sequestered in a nearby laboratory,
antimatrer is being produced.
Professor Mark Schneider has
built a contraption to slow down
and capture positron: (antimatter
electrons) produced by the radioac-
live decay ofisotopc Na-22. Grinncll
professors are trying to find a way to
slow down these positrons so that
they can be used in experiments. But
the Grinneil physics depsrrment’s
aspirations don't stop (hCICr In tho
words of Schneider, “Maybe after
that, the warp drive?"

To see the past endeav-
ors of physicist invenrors,
one must only wander over

to the large glass case in the
Elbow (rhe large curvy portion of the
building with windows, a couple ta-
bles and a chalkboard). Here you will
find the Physics Historical Museum.
This collection contains obsolete
physics equipment dating all the way
back to 1869. Those who are astro-
nomically inclined may notice that
the museum contains quite a few
meteorites. Many of these are from
H. H. Ninninger, who paid for his
daughter’s tuition with meteorites in
the 19305.You may want to keep this
in mind when administration hikes
up tuition again next year.

After your wonderful
romp down the rabbit hole
ofNoyce, as you’re about to

leave tho building, be sure
to check out the large slab of wood
that’s been plunked in front of the
entrance.

This chunk oftree stump is called
the Worley Tree Table, and it's made
from the remains of an elm tree that
was torn up in 1995 to milk: room
for a new addition to the science
building. cratrsmsn Byron Worley
put the stump in a display table and
marked important Grinnell College
dates on the tree’s rings.
