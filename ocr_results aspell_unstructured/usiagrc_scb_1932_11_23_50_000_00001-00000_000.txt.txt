(of Room

“Women will be admitted to enjoy
the benefits of the Pioneer Recreation
Center," according to a statement is
sued today by Abe Rosenhloom, chair-
man of the Pioneer Chest Fund.

The admittance of women to share
equally with the men the privileges
of the center was decided at a meet-
ing of the Pioneer Chest Fund com-
mittee last night

Solicitations for pledges to the Pio-
need Chest Fund from the women
have been completed. The total
amount pledged in the quadrangle has
not been ascertained but it is believed
that it is greater than that of last
year.

An indefinite alteration of plans
for the Pioneer Recreation Center
calls for remodeling the laundry room
of the heating plant. Prof. Grant 0.
Cale of the physics department has
submitted to the committee blue
prints of the proposed change.

The dimensions of the newly con-
sidered room are 60 feet by 30 feet.
“There is ample space for a luncheon
ctte, card. pingrpong, and pool tables.
A dance floor will also he installed,"
stated Mr. Rosenbloom in an inter—
view with a Scarlet and_,Black
porter today.

It is proposed that the recreation
center shall be open approximately 10
hours a day. All students may utilize
its facilities any time during these
hours.

Thanksgiving in This Depression
Era Much Like Original Feast Day

(By a Staff Writer)

Thanksgiving time in the year 3
D.D. (During Depression), is much
like the first.Thanksgiving daymex-
cept that there are more wolves now
and most of us will celebrate Turkey
Day with good old chicken (which
will be entirely appropriate if the
fowls are Plymouth Rocls),

Grinnell college students have only
Thanksgiving day to spend at home
this year, unless they want to take
triple cuts for each class missed,
Formerly one dollar was charged for
each class missed. This year many
students are thankful that they do
not have to pay cash to cut classes.
If it were so, probably fewer classes
would be cut.

For those students who remain
in Crinnell over the holiday open

Aggies Win
Valley Title

Cowboys Had Not Taken
Loop Since 1926

(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

STILLWATER, Okla.— Oklahoma
Aggies are holding Somewhat awk—
wardly their Missouri Valley football
honors It is six years since the Age
gies have worn the crown; and it’s
a bit unfamiliar.

It was in 1926 that the Cowboys
last held the Valley title; and, oddly
enough, a victory over Grinnell fig-
ured largely in that championship.
Now, by their 27-0 triumph over
the Fioneers last Friday night,
the Aggies again are sitting on the
top rung of the conference ladder.

Rm Hall, incidentally, set himself
up as the Valley’s leading scorer. Be-
fore the game he had trailed one
point behind the 37 at which Ullrich,
Pioneer quarterback, and Highfill,
Aggic quarter, were tied. Hall made
two counters for the Aggies, while
neither Highfill nor Ullricn scored,
giving him a standing of 48 points.

Hall's 68-yard run for one of his
touchdowns was the high spot of the
game and helped him roll up a total
gain of 132 yards.
