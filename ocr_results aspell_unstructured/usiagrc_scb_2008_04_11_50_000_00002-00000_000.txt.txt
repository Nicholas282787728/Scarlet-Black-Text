New group to make Grinnell Wiki

BYARIANISFELD

A new website may soon become the premier source for
information about Grinnell clubs and cultulc.

A new group created by members of SGA and the Vorce
Box intends to create a wiki, which will allow Grinnellians to
share information abour Grinncll tmtiitiorrs. student groups
and more. Group organizer Harry Krejsa '10 said the site would
hopefully be ready within a few weeks,

The idea for a wiki underwent convergent
evolution in the VoiceBox and among SGA
representatives, VoiceBox co-Adininistrator
Emily Srievcr '09 said rhc VoiceBox wanted a
space where activist groups on campus could
share experiences, strategies and ideas. “The
Voiccan had explored the option of creating
our own \viki," she Said,“to have a place to put
activism and social justice resources for Snir
dents and student groups.”

lvlcanwhilc, Krejsa “heard lots of people talk about a [po
tenrral] Grinncll Wiki, a place were people could wrrte about
Gtinnell's tradition, culture, events and history,"hc said. “Not
to mention clear up the mess of acronyms and abbreviations
that plague Grinnell life."

The VoiccBox admin isrrators had already started to develop
their own wild on Pioneeer/eb, when Stiever mentioned the

a plate where people could
write aboul Grime/ll Wadi/on,
(U/lUl’e, events and history,”

idea to Krcjsa in passing in class.

They soon combined their Wiki ideas and drafted a resolu-
tion that called for the formation ofan ad hoc SGA committee
ro implement the Wiki project After r short debate over the
resolution at Joint Board, proscntcrs Krcjsa and Greg Hudson
’09 withdrew it so that thcy could form a student group instead.
CND senator Spencer Green ’09 argued that (11!: creation of
a wiki oversight committee went against the idea of self—gov-
ernance and other Joint Board members
agrccd.

An outside Server will host the site to
avoid issues of content conﬂicting with
college policy. Such issues occurred in
2003 when GrinncllPlans was forced of?
rho Grinncll server for failing to comply
with college computing policy, as rcporred
in a Sept 5, 2003 sens article. The group
hopes to purchase a domain name “similar to GrinnellWiki.
com” Within a week, said Krejsa. He said that he expects ‘it to
cost “wellnnder ii hundred dollars it year"for site hosting

At Joint Board and in conversations about the wi idca,
questions arose about potential content issues ranging from
slander ro privacy issues, According to Sriever, they had not
yet worked out all the security details, but expected that users
would need it Grinnell email address to edit the Wiki

Shuttle

ham p. 1 Safety and Securirysaid the service might

also ease parking constraints by making
it easier for students without cars to get
around Giinncll, partrcularly rnternarional students who can
not bring cars to campus. “Security is in a position to provide
that service [to the students] to get groceries or medicine," he
said.

Courtney Shcchan '11, who has already used the service,
said that it made shopping much more convenient. “[Ii’s] a
great Option when you don't feel like mooching a ride from
your friends or your friends don’t feel like letting you mooch,"
‘said Sheehan. “Or if your friends iudge you for going to Wal—
Mart,"

Security Supervisor Amy Coleman said the service has been

well-utilized by students. “I felt there was a need for student
shuttles because it was a safety issue, and since that time it’s
been used regularly,” she said.

Though Sheehan has only used the service once, she be-
lieves it is “very encouraging that rhe college provides trans-
portation to places where you can get food other than their
own facilities."

“My driver even told me he would rake me to Dairy [Amen
