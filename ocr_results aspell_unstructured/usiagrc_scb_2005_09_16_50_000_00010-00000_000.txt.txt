Self-interest grips Bush, West

k, Kanye West,
a successful artist in his own
right, made the somewhat can,
troversral stateriient that “Bush
does not care about black peo-
pic." While that may be true,
West did not do us the favor ofjustifying his conclusion with verifiable facts.

It is possible that he was simply venting his spleen and ended up speaking
out before actually thinking about what he said. It is also possible that this was
a cheap saint to boost sales of his newly released album,

Whatever the casc,l thought, “Wow,Wcst has got to care about black people
a lot to have the guts to say something like that to a national audience.” With
these thoughts lurking at the back of my rnind,I made arrangements to attend
the 20th Black Family Reunion Celebration, an annual twtrday cultural event
that is recognized as the largest and most significant family event in the nation
that attracts more than 500,000 people each year, on September 10‘" and 11‘",

Letters to f
the Editor

2005.

Seeing that this festival ”celebrates the endure
itig strengths and traditional values of the African
American family,"I thought West was going to be
there to demonstrate the solidarity that he feels to-
wards with his fellow African Americans

well, west was a rioeshow Perhaps, he would
have liked to be invited first or offered some money
to perform. Perhaps, he was too busy promoting his
new CD or berrcr still, he may have been busy help—
lug the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

Whatever the case, I think I should be free to
speculate that Buslr,West and I Will never fail to act

in our selfish interests when the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs.
President Bush rushed to help the disaster victims when his approval ratings
began to slip, West made his controversial statement to boost sales of his new
album and I attended the Black
Family reunion simply based on the off chance that I will get to see West
in person when he showed up to show solidarity with his people. We live in a
capitalist nation iwhat do you expect?

London and Grinnell strike similar chords

Cheerio! I’ve been in London for over three weeks now, and
although I'm six time zones away I've come to realize that Lone
don' rsnt really that much different from Grinnell. 1 mean, sure,

London underground: non-cheerful, hopefully not yellow,
below ground. But stiu, they're borh low-cost ways of get-
ring you where you need to be, quickly Well quickly, except

London is one of the worlds major cities, with a population of for when theres a signal failure or engineering work, or track

seven million people, while Grinnell
is one of Poweshiek Countys major
towns, With a population of 10,000
people . .but basically, its not that r .

different Bollocks, you say? Well, ‘5 fr
see what a head to head comparison l ‘
yields. H

McNa/Iyi mm Terra,

Despite its medicinalesounding .
name (“Man,l had a really nasty cough but then 1 took
some Tesco"), Tesco is actually a grocery chain There is one
about 20 feet from my flat, and they stay open until 11pm,
(That’s late, here.) They also have a bakery where i can buy
delicious, delicious chocolatecﬁlled croissants.Tesco is also full
of delightful British foodstiifrs such as mango-passionfruit
ﬂavoured Kit-Kats (don’t ask me to explain, because I can’t),
prawn cocktail ﬂavoured crisps (that's potato chips to you),
steak and kidney pies, and about eight thousand different kinds
of tea. Rumour has it that there are independent coffeeshops
somewhere in this city, but I have yet to see one

replacement, or whatever excuse
London Transportation has for you
today. (To my knowledge, at least,
“Someone got drunk arid threw a
train off the loggia"‘has never been
a problem here) Still, when they
go show up, they have nice comfy
upholstered seats (unless it’s rush
hour, when you will never get a seat, ever, and will be forced
to stand, clinging for life to a pole as the
train bumpily stops at each station.) Tube
stations are a good place to hear amateur
musicians, just like picking up a campus
bike on the Forum Beach.

Everyone who lives in London is beau-
tiful. seriously, I think they make all their
unattractive residents move elsewhere. You may also be inter
ested to note that they all (mostly) have excellent teeth. but
they all drive in a way that strikes fear into the hearts of pedesr
trians. London residents have way cooler accents than Grinnell
residents.

Tl): 88S versus Tl): Sim

London’s T12: Sun is way funnier than the stfS, plus it has
hot girls on page three. Unfortunately, Tr” sun is not intend
ed to be a humorous publication, In fact, although The Sim is
probably the best-known ofthese, London has a Wide variety of
incredibly trashy tabloids availableThese “newspapers” largely
cover: 1) things that happen to celebrities (“Posh Spice Buys
New Hat"), 2) unfortunate things that happen to nonscelebc
rities (“7-year-old Boy watches Father Get Eaten by Shark")
and 3) unfortunate things that happen to celebrities (“Posh
Spice Eaten by Shark"), lr is required by law that every Lone
doncr carry at least one of these publications with them on the
Tube at all times.

C/ﬂyfml Palate M'I‘Ju: Hurling/ram Palate

Buckingham Palace is the ofﬁcial home of
the Her Majesty the Queen and her priceless
collection of artwork; the C stal Palace is
the official home onour Permanent Record
and the occasional collection of student arts
work. However, both are excellent places to
stand in line for long periods of time.

It’s probably a stretch to say that these parallels make Lon—
don just like Grinnell, But one thing they definitely do have in
common is that I love them both dearly, God save the CLuccn,
and God save Darby.

Helpdesk needs your help

Last spring our Helpdesk banner was stolen from
the porch of the I-lelpdesk house, so this summer we
locked the other one down with padlodts and last
weekend the banner was ripped from the porch and
stolen. The padlock; were left, ofooursc Wcliiwc the
banners so that dun'ng N50 and other campus funk .
tions, it is easy to find someone to assist with Technol—
ogy questions, also by bringing the banner on the porch,
we are able to remind students/faculty/paretrts that we
are located conveniently for them to stop in and get
help with their computer problems.

I probably won‘t replace the banners as they ire
evpensive to have piinted, but wonder why they were ,
taken in the first place What use would someone
have for a college's helpdcsk banner. it cant really be
used to. anything‘ I havent seen a rival helpdesk open
anywhere on campus -) lfyou know where the first
one (that wasnt damaged) might be located, please let
me know It would be nice to have one of them to use
again.

Britney baby names

Happy baby Britney spears. Heck yeahl What
in the good cahoots will she name it? Celebrity
names are totally bunk 1 mean Apple. Pubdecz,
You know where baby names are awesome? In the
Phillipiues Names like: Babes and Dudes. Yes real
people are named those names. Dweezil and Moon
Unit are ridiwlous names. But they are not from
the Phillipincs Here are some names you shouldnc
name your children; Madison, Hayleigh, Bradford,
Adolf, Aloyisious, Brulrhilde. OK we have to quit,
we are having an argument about bad names. Some
of us think names like Vivian and Frank and Cyril
are lousy. Misspelling is roullv lame Par Example,
Barbara Streisand. Wheres the other: A ho bag!
And hey come to drink of Britney is a pretty bad
misspelling ofwharever the heck it is a misspelling
of. So this is our personal congratulations to that
tine paragon of womanhood, that shining star in
America’s sky, and a request that she keep it clean.
Name him something nice, Brit.
