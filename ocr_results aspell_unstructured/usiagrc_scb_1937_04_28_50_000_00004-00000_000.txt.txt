Front Line Positions-

"I want some guards that can
block.” Guy Leokahaugh, cinr
nell’s football mentor remarked as
the spring grid drills got under
way a month ago, and if long
hours of constant practice mean
anything the scarlet and black
machine should be equipped with
three or four herd blockillg‘ guards
next season.

Four lettermen from last fall
reported for guard service this
spring. The two who had seen
the most service were Big Ed
Woodward and Harold High. The
other pair, noted for their offen-
sive work late in the season, were
John Spence and Ralph West'

Woodward Shifted

Never the man to be satisfied
with anything short of perfection,
Lookabaugh has shifted Wood»
ward to a tackle position to malte
better use of his size and has
moved Jack Osborn, a letter wi -
ner at tackle, to a guard. Both
men seem to have adapted them-
selves to the change and Looka-
haugh is satisfied that the move
was beneficial.

To sdpport these veterans Norm
'rschirley has come up from the
ranks to press his bid for a first
string guard post, 'lsehirley is
bigger than any of the four letter
winners and the fact that he
learns fast may enable him to
overcome his inexperience in time
to become a starter next season.

Two Sets of Gimrds

According to his present plans,
Lookahaugh would use two sets of
guards, alternating sets at each
quarter. Osborn and Tsehiiley
seem a likely pair to get an as-
