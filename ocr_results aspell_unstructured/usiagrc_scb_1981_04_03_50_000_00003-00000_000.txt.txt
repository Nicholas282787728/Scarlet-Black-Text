by Laura Carter

The Annual Fund Telethon will begin
its third run Monday, April 5 in the
North Lounge of the Forum and last
through Saturday, April 12. During the
week, 116 students will call nearly 5,000
parents and alumni to solicit contribuv
tions to the Fund. which helps pay stu7
dent scholarships and tuition, iaculty
salaries and campus maintenance, The
program will take place Monday
through Saturday irom 5:15pm. tomao
p.m. and on Sunday irom 2:15 p.m. to
5:30 pm. and 6:15 p.m. to 9:30 pm.

The {underaising effort is being coor»
dinated by General Chairman Scott C.
Ross and Leslie G Taylor. the senior
class chairperson. The two are working
with the Development Otiice and its
director of annual giving programs,
Warren Reinecke. Reinecke described
the telethon as one of three ways in
which the college raises funds and idene
tilied the others as mail contact and
personal, [aceto—iace contact, Before
the first telethon, which was held last
spring. only members of the Develop-
ment Oflice stall had worked on this
campaign but Reinecke said, “This
way the etticiency is greatest. Also it is
more personal and the people get to find
out what's going on by talking to cur
rent students.“

Ross agreed that the telethon is more
personal than sending literature to
parents and alumni “It works a lot bet-
ter, " he explained. “If they see “Grin-
nell College on a letter, they can tell
what‘s going to be in the envelope.
Some will just throw it out or forget
about it," Nevertheless. the parents
and alumni to be called have received

by Marilyn Clark

On Saturday, April 4, the annual
KDIC Auction will take place in South
Lounge beginning at 2 pm. There will
be 5'Iive broadcast and a callrin book-
up system.

Although in the past the auction has
been held in Darby, “this year the auc»
tion will be held in South Lounge
because it is more comfortable and the
sound is better than Darby,” according
to Dave Buck, station manager at
KDIC.

Dick Sears, 3 prolessmnal auctioneer
who has been involved with the auction
{or 11 years, will again auction the
items donated
Some of the highlights among the items
to be auctioned are:

notice that they will be contacted,

Reinecke lelt that the project also
benefits the people who do the calling,
"Volunteerism is part of the American
way, In this manner. students can work
for someuiing mey really believe in."

These students represent all classes
at Grinnell as 25 seniors, 18 juniors, 35
sophomores and 38 freshmen signed up
to do the dialing. Another group or
students are listed as alternates and
may still work the Saturday and Sun-
day sessions or may stop in North
Lounge at the beginning at any session
in case there are any empty seats. Ross
stressed that all workers must show up
by 6:15 pm, [or the evening sessions
and 2:15 pm Sunday or they will be
replaced.

The callers will be contacting certain
groups oi donors during uie sessions.
These groups are new donors, who have
never contributed, and those who may
donate more than they have in the past,
Ross said these people are targeted in
order to meet the Joyce Foundation
Challenge, a program which began last
July and will end this June.

The Challenge is sponsored by a
Chicago-based bottling company and
can be used as a tax shelter tor the
organization since it contributes $25 for
each new donor pledge or $25 to $99 and
one-hall at any new donor contribution
which exceeds Slot]. Any increased
donor amount earns the college one-
half oi the increase tram the Joyce
Foundation

The 1984) Fall Annual Fund Telethon
raised $75, 000 of the $100000 available
from the Challenge, which is separate

3) Fishing and a picnic on a Saturday
atternoon in May for six to eight people

donated by the Pub,

“In recent years," Buck smted, ”the
auction has raised between $600 and
mo, But iivc or six years ago KDIC
was able to raise almost $1,200 during
one auction." Buck felt that the decline
is, to some degree, due to competition
with SGA'S CaSlno Night auction and
the Progressive Dinner. “Many pros
fessors do not want to be involved with
two student dinners," Buck said.

Although Buck did not predict how

'miich money KDIC expected the auc-

tion to bring in, he is hoping for a lot or
student support and participation this
year. All or the money collected will be
placed in the capital equipment lurid at

picnics,

irorn the $75,500 earned directly by
pledges. Ross reported that only $5,000
is needed from new donors and $10,000
from moss increasing their giits to earn
the entire amount from the Challenge,
“I feel Very confident, " he stated “The
students do a good job 7 they ve proven
it "

Ross also realizes the time commits
merit these studenw must make and ex»
plained that tive to seven percent at the
proiit {mm the telethon is used to buy
prizes for these volunteers. “Volunteer
ing is working for free but who works
for free anymore?" he said. "If they’re
going to raise that much money, we'll
give them something to work for." This
“something" includes three {rec meals
each session, t-shirts, ice cream, other
refreshments and a tree 10-minute
telephone call to any place in the con
tinental United States. The meals will
be awarded to the top three money-
raisers of each shift and include a $20
dinner for two at BJ's or JD'S
restaurants, a sit) dinner for one at the
same places and one 35 lunch at JD'S.
The t»shirts Will be given to each
worker and will contain the telethon
logo and a slogan designed by Ross.
And the ice cream will be a Selection of
four kinds each evening from Baskin
Robbins

The Development Office reported
that the alumni and parents' funds are
running ahead of themselves {or this
point in time as compared to the past
two years. The leaders of the telethon
are hoping that new records of money
raised and participation can be set with
