With but five lettermen back from
the 1931 squad, Ed Wright, Quaker
coach, is presented with a gigantic
problcm in getting together a comr
binotion that will stand up under
four quarters of battering from the
hands of their Missouri Valley con-

thomcu ineligible
The incligihility of five linemen
and the failure of three others to ch

blow to Penn prospects. in the back-

Quakers of their sterling punter and
plunger of last year, Jack Cowan,
while Wells and Owens of the 1931
aggregation have failed to return
Only Don Graft and cliff Wilkins
of last year's backfield are haclr for
competition. Neither has had a great
amount of experience however.
In the line the only veterans are
Captain Gallagher. three~year veterr

is playing his fourth year at an end
position, and John Bell, center, who
is beginning his thirrl season for thc
gold and blue.

Turkish tobacco is to cigarettes what seasoning is
to food. . the "spice," the "sauce.” You don’t want
too much seasoning in food. Or in a cigarette. But
you do want enough!

Chesterﬁeld uses just the right amount of Turkish
tobacco. Not loo much, but just enough to give to
Chesterﬁeld the ﬁnishing touch of better lnslc and
aroma.

Smoke 21 Chesterﬁeld . . . and wstc the difference.
