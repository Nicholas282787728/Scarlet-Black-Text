By Susan Thomas

It was a busy week for the

baseball team as they took tothc
road in a search for victory with

five consecutive games. After
losing all live including a dou-
bleheader againSt Knox, a close

game versus Coe, and then any.

other doubleheader at Cornell
the team is ready to return home.

Lust Saturday, the team vis-
ited Knox, who is undefeated in
ondefeated in conference, for a
doubleheader in which they lost
both games 6-3 and 1171. Chris

Wolfgram "pitched well in the ,

ﬁrst game but was bothered by
his old troubles, getting behind
andissuingwalks," according to
Coach Greg Wallace.

Wolfgram only had ﬁve hiLs
against him the entire game, but
because of errors, those hits re-
sulted in sixruns for theSiwash.
Coach Wallacealso saidthat the
team needs to be toughter men-
tally on defense when the team
has two cuts.

The second game, pitched by
Ben Wallace, was lost by a dis»
appointing score of 11-1, wiui
the ion Grinnell score coming
from Corey Jones with his sec-
ond home nln of the season. "I
am most disappointed with our
hitting," said Coach Wallace
when asked about the game.

On Tuesday, the Pioneers
packed their bags for a trip to
Coe, and a close 5-4 loss. Dave
Shane pitched "very well and
allowed only ﬁve Kohawk hits",
The hitting was also improved
as Jones, Marty Hunsucker,
Chris Wolfgram, and Mike
Mohan getting two hits apiece.

The team continued their
away series on Wednesday with
a rescheduled doubleheader at
Cornell. Both games were lost,
the frost by a score of 84), and
the second by 3-2 in eight in-
nings. Wolfgrarn pitched well
the forst game, but hitting was
again the problem for the Pio-
neers who were allowed only
one hit the entire game.

Ben Wallace pitched the sec-
ond game and "pitched the best
game he‘s pitched all season."

"Hitting let us down. We
got only five hits in the
doubleheader. Hitting like that
won't win us many ballgames,"
said Coach Wallace who also
added, "When you're young,
especially in pitching like we
are, losing the close ones really
hurts."

The team ﬁnished their road
series this Saturday versus
Monmouth, before returning
home for a game on Wednesday
against Comell at 2:30.

Last weekend the men’s tennis
team returned from Wisconsin af—
ter a 0-9 loss to Ripon and an im-
pressive 7-2 win over Lawrence.
Coach Dave Arsenault noted that
the long road trip contributed to a
listless performance againstRipon.
Arsenault added, “Ripon has a very
solid line-up and will be tough to
beat at conference. Lawrence was
our best match so far, and particu-
larly in doubles, where we jumped
out to a 3—0 lead."

Last year Ripon and Lawrence
ﬁnished ﬁrst and second respec-
tively at conference. The weekend
was an opportunity for the young
Grinnell squad to see how they
measured up against the best com»
petition in the conference.

AgainstRipon, the best singles
play for Grinnell included number
three Peter Greif, who lost 2-6, 7-6,
