A very valuable catalog of op-
portunities in the service and in
allied branches of work is the
American Counsel of Education
series of bulletins called “War
Service Opportunities." This is
published by the American Coun-
sel on Education in Washington,
D. C. Nearly every college in the
nation has copies of these bulle—
tins which have been brought up
to date every two weeks. Another
valuable document is the sump
may from the announcements by
the New York Counsel on .Educa
tion, which lists the service op-
portunities indexed according to
one’S major subject in college.

is available through Civil Service
or through the regular army re-

er’ The Signal Corps of the U. 5.
Army, ‘The Nerve Center of the

Dean Beatty recommends to
parents and to alumni interested
in serving in the armed forces
the article “How the Army Sorts
its Men,” by Dr. Bing—ham, in the
September issue of Harpers, and
the whole edition of September
Occupations magazine.
Educational Guidance

In the March bulletin of Grin-
nel College “Educational Guidance
in War Time," copies of which
are available in the Alumni offi-
ce, Dean Beatty has said: “The
directors of training programs for
the army, the Navy and the Air
Forces, and the U. s. Commis-
sioner of Education emphasize
the special importance of cer-
tain college and university de<
partments of study: mathematic‘s,
physics, chemistry, bacteriology,
health, communications (precision
in English composition and pub-
lih speaking, foreign languages),
and the basic social studies which
provide an understanding of the
economic, sociological, geograpﬁi~
cal. and political nature of the
war.

“In these departments of study
and in other related ones the
College of Liberal Arts in Ameri—
ca affords abundant opportuni—
ties to students Colleges of en-
gineering alone can not supply
all the kinds of education re‘quir-
ed for the success of the national
war effort, though their contrir

Hey You! Uncle Sam Cadahout

Neither can Army and Navy R.

enough prospective officers. At
the Baltimore Conference in Jan-
uary, 1942, of the representatives
of the War and Navy Departs
ments and the Directors of the
Selective Service and the U. 5.
Civil Seivice, with the American
College Association, officers of
the Federal Government remind-
ed colleges that only onerfourth
of the candidates for officers’ ap-
pointments can come from the
limited number of college juniors
and seniors who have taken ode
vanced R.0.T.C. training; and that
the other three-fourths must
come from the Ofﬁcers' Candie
dates Training Schools in active
service. Thus, in the education
now of men who may later be-
come officers, the colleges and
universities have a great respon-
sibihty.

Gates Men End Nomad Life;
Settle In “The Annex”

By John Kendrick

Lespite sliirring remarks made by
jealous balls on the campus, the
official location of the new Gates
hall is the corner of Route 6 and
Main street, across the
Wayside lnn, according to How-
ard J. Laurie, president.

After weeks of expectant wait-
ing, living out of suitcases and
paper bags, the residents were
informed by Mrs. Ray Ferguson,
head of the housekeeping de~
partment, that Sunday would he
the day.

With the help of the Railway
Express, a truck and a man were
on hand to cart luggage, books,
furniture, and other incidentals to
the new hall.

The formal opening of the hall
took place Sunday night when a
housemeeting was held to greet
three new hall members and sev»
eral alumni who are camping at
the house until called to the
Army. The new men are trans—
fers; .Edivard Keller, Richard

from

Funk and Robert Larson. The old
men are Louis Gonias, assistant
football coach and captain of last
year's team, and Sterling lLord,
assistant in the publicity depart-
ment and last year's president ”of
Gates.

Gates hall teems with fireplaces
and bay windows, plastic show-
ers, and winding stairs. Study
rooms are on first and second
floor and the third floor is used
as a barrack sleeping room.

Only casualty of the general
exodus on Sunday from Langan
to Gates was John H. Kendrick,
hall brother, who shattered the
cartilage in his knee while look-
ing under a bed for dirty socks.

The latest addition to the hall
is Thurman, a black and white
dog of uncertain vintage, who has
an injured leg. The mascot has a
tendency to wander, and Gates
hall will appreciate it if you
suggest that he return home ev-
ery evening.
