Saturday Science
To the campus community:

As active members of Saturday
Science, a student—init rated program
described in the February 16 issue of
the Scarlet and Black, we are writing
to address some concerns that have
arisen because ofan activity wespon
sored involving pithed frogs. The
goal of Saturday Science is to en—
courage fifth and sixth grade girls to
be interested and achieve in science.

The following description is in
response toconcerns raised by SDAE
and a request for more procedural
information. In the process of pltlr
ing, the backof a frog’s brain isjabbed
with a needle, resulting in nearly
instantaneous destruction of brain
activity, including ability to sense
pain. Although the brain no longer
functions, some processes, including
heartbeat and muscle reﬂexes, con—
tinue. According to biologists expe—
rienced in pithing. the process more
effectively anesthetizes the frogs than
a chemical anesthetic.

Reactions to the frog pithing
coupled With last week‘s letter to the
editor from SDAE have caused us to
consider the implications of this ac«
tivity and to initiate changes in the
organizational structure of Saturday
Science. These changes wouldallow
for evaluation of planned activities
before they are performed With girls
from the Orinnell Middle School.
We do not Wish to make a general
statement about the use of animals in
science. However. we take three
major concerns very seriously and
will be working with other members
of Saturday Science to address them
in the future.

To begin with, there are meth.
ods other than the use of animals to
teach children about anatomy and
physiology ln science education,
other learning aids, such as models,
posters, and activity books are avaiL

able and should also be used,

Second, when one is insensitive
to thelife ofanimalsinteachingalife
science such as biology to young peo«
ple, one conveys mixed messages to
students, If some girls are upset by
dissection, it would be discouraging
for them to think that the only way
to learn biology is through using an»
imals. It is not our intent to convey
such a message,

Finally, our primary goal is to
encourage girls to think about the
science activities they do at the col-
lege and hence to further their inter—
est in science. An important part of
this purpose is a policy of honesty
and clarity involving the reality or
the experiments they perform. The
leader ofthe frog activity was honest

were treated and their ultimate fate.
However, it is common practice for
adults to mislead children. for exam—
ple to tell them that animals wrll

continue living after dissection. in
an attempt to protect them from the
truth. lfeducatorscannotbctruthful

reconsider our approach.

we recognize SDAE’s concerns
about the use ofanimals as valid, and
value this consciousness as a starting
point for change.

Dedication to SDAE

To the campus community:

Last week on my 1(ch show I
made a dedication to the Students in
Defense of Animals and the Envi»
ronmenr. The satiric piece read as
follows: “This one is to all the milir
tarit vegetarians out there who not
only had the courage to make their
own life—style choice, but who try to
force that decision on others; hey,
guys. we‘re at the top of the food
chain." Although I found this piece
a humorous way to get across a mes»
sage oftolerance to the SDAE mem-
bers, one member. Bnice Friedrich,
was either unable or unWilling to see
the humor. His reaction was printed
in the Scarlet and Black’s Letters to
the Editor section and he reproached
the person on KDIC for the argu-
ment: “quit forcing your morality on
other people." Bruce goes on to say
that“meat»eatersfotcetheirmurder<
ous and hedonistic food choices on
animals without a second thought.”
But perhaps the most disturbing part
of this letter was Bnice’s claim that
my satirical piece was the same argu»
ment "used by slave holders on this
continent for 350 years and more
recently by wife bearers, child abuSr
ers, gay bnshers, the Apartheid gov«
ernment in South Africa, and by all
other groups who felt that exploltzk
tion and Violence against other be—
ings was a question of their personal
morality."

Although Bruce’s letter provid<
ed no end of laughter and amuse<
ment. 1 was disturbed bythe extrem<
ist attitude and blatant overreaction
toasimplepieceofsatire, Especially
When that piece refers to What the
vast majority of people worldwide
consider a natural function of biolo»
gy: the consumption by one life—form
of another liferform as per the food
chain, The extreme extension of
this argument would necessitate the
manufacturing of totu antelopes for
lions on the Serengeti; granted this is
farcical, but from the standpoint ofa
person who does not see the need to
stop eating meat, it serves its pur-
pose, i readily ndmit that some live.
stock farming methods are perverse
and disgusting; however, the eating
of meat in and of itself is not the
problem. Asanothercxtremcexam—

ple, one might claim that in order to
shut down all nuclear reactors, every
man, woman and child should cease
using c cirtcity

While it is tempting to respond
With namercalling along the lines of
fascist, jllmti,:lriclsclimllck, i'niatrnid
I inust refrain from doing so. While
drawing parallels between the blind

ns fun and exciting for me as Bruce's
list of comparisons was to him, it is
inappropriate hehnvior tor a mature
adult and, in point of fact, might be
considered [libelous] I would simply
like to remind Bruce, SDAE, and the
entire campusconimunity that issues
of politics and morality are a matter
of personal choice. Choice means
choice YouwillfindrhattheAmer—
ican C|V|l Liberties Union will work
to defend both Haitian refugees and

with another person‘s philosophy.
that person has every right to believe
as they do. Tolerance and reliance
on personal choice are the corner.
stonestoindividual liberty. lnsisting
upon any one philosophy, no matter
how sure you are in your mind of the
“correctness" ofyour opinion, is both

can challenge the meat—eating status
quo is an example orsuch ideological
freedom. The right ofclioice applies
to all issues,

Basketball Championship
To the Grinnell community:

I would like to commend the
Athletic Department and Coach
Arsenaulr for their commitment to
the men’s basketball program Over
the past seven years. Coach Arsenault
has rebuilt the basketball program
into a reain we are all proud of. The
victory over Ripon [two weeks ago]
sealed the Conference title and
placed the team inthe NCAA Divi—
sion Ill national tournament. In
additiontotheteam'sglory,the night
was also extiting tor the college and
Grinnell community. Darby Gym—
nasium Was overﬂowing with stu—
dents, staff, faculty, and administrar
tors from the college as well as many
community members. The enthusi-
asm backing the Pioneer basketball
teamunitedthepeopleinartendance.
I believe that the hard work and
effort of the men’s basketball team
provided for an inspiring town and
gown event.

Thank you,
