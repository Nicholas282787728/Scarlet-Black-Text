hrs: The safest place to look
when dancing is 1/5 turn to
your left, over your partner's
right shoulder. You can keep a
conversation going while at
the same time keeping your
eye out for potential
collisions with drunk

people.

ARMS: Men, plate your n'ght
hand just below the woman's
shoulder blade. Position your
right arm away from your
body with your elbow
pointing slightly to the side,

Arusr Women, your left arm
should rest gently on the
man's upper arm. rhe
woman’s right hand rests in
the palm of the man's left
hand. The joined hands
should be raised to the eye
level of the shorter partner.

Fm: Your body should be
offset by 1/2 body distance
to your own left, with your
right foot pointed in
between your partner's
feet. rhis will prevent (or
at least help prevent) you
from stepping on your
partner’s toes.

Don't dance like 'you did (or didn‘t) in junior high.
Learn to waltz. It might look complicated, but it’s
really not~just look at the guide. The feel with
small heels are the follows, and big heels

are the leads.
