at the Republic of South Africa.
Students marched to the police
station and attempted to burn the
flag whereupon the police ordered
them not to proceed across a cer-

the University or Witwatersrand.

of the prime minister's speech at
that university, which is one or the

Question: How about concerts?
Are they segregated?

ment does not want to make a ball
image on the periormers because
when these performers come back

say bad things in public. This is
also why in large cities there is
less segregation because tourists

Subsequent to that, the president
of the SRC was up for arrest. but

high 7 maybe a lite sentence.

United States?

Ansue Yes. Especially
because it would not be possible to
have such a group in South Airica
Divestment has been advocated
and still is being advocated by
every major black leader at
repute In South Airica. For in-
stance Dr. Albert Lumuli the late
president of the A.N.C, Alrlcan
National Congress], and Nobel
Prize winner appealed strongly to
both the US. and Britian to divest
irom South Africa in order to ac-
celerate the tide oi change. The
recent Nobel Prize winner Des-
mond Tutu lost his passport ior
advocating divestment whilst in
Denmark, Steve Biko, Nelson
Mandela. and other reputable
leaders have been foremost
spokespeople ior divestment.
Polls taken in South Alrica are
unl'epresentatlve and laughable
because the people cannot openly
express their views Without the
threat at punishment by the
government.

Question: Moving closer to our
home. what US. presidential cans
didate would win in your opinion
most facilitate an end to the in-
humanity in South Africa?

Answer: Definitely Reagan is
not desired, His policy towards
South Alrica has been viewed as
directed against the advancement
of blacks in South Alrica, When
Carter lost the election there was
a nationwide disappointment
because he was viewed as a
posnive inﬂuence In the course of
the struggle in South Airica Thus.
right now I side with the people
who definitely iavor any other
candidate than Reagan, This is in
the hope that he or she would
restore the progress initiated by
the previous Carter administra-
tion ill the form oi sanctions and
concerted eliort oi the UN
against South Africa,
