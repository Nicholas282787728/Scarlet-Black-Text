Hughes Traces

To Economics.

By Barbara Brann

Langston Hughes, negro
writer, first realized from
his own experience the,
acuteness of the color line
Situation in the United
States when he started look—
ing for a job in New York
after one year at the Uni-
versity of Columbia. He has
been writing and Speaking
about it ever Since.

His lrLformal autobiographical
talk Sunday night in Herrick
chapel boreobvious traces at so-
cial propaganda. In the days
when the term propaganda was
concomittant With unpleasant
connotations, Hughes was “accus»
ed" of being a “propaganda po-
et" by antics. The purpose of his
poetry, he admits, is to stress the
economic plight of the negro race;
and he is satisfied it his readers
are aware of that thought.

An extensive traveler in. his'
youth, Hughes pointed out that
his consciousness of racial pi-
dice was not confined to the Unit-
ed States, He was surprised to
rind. he said, that it existed tc
a comparatively large degree in
Arr-ice, the negl‘oes’ homeland
Here it is primarily on an 900»:

ternational viewpoint on the ne-

gro Situation was widened and
confirmed. In Paris, he explain.

most part American, is employ»
ed chietly as night club enter-
tainers.

The present war has made the
race problem even more interna-
tional in scope, he believes. The
problem, in regard to the war
exists in the minds or negroes in
the form of a paradox, according
to Mr. Hughes. They are told
we are righting tor the Four
Freedoms, and yet they are not
in the democratic ideal sense
tree.

The speaker illustrated with
several personal experiences and
observations the economic sup»
pression of his race. His own
magnetic personality helped tc
project his general thought, and
it was well received by his audi-
ence. He made no tangible sug-
gestions for alleViating the site
nation just stated the facts,
Hearing his poetry read by its
:tuLhor, the audience was better
able to grasp the feeling Hughcs
personally holds on the subject.

The highlight or the program
was his conclusion by reading a
series of his new poems as yet
unpublished. In praise or a wom.

they are entitled “Madame, Tc
