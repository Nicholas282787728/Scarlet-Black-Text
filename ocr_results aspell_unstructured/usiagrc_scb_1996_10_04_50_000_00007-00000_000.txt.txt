Game...

This week‘s topic, the proposed Flat Tax, You heard
Steve Forbes tout it during the Republican primary.
and now it's little to examine it closely, and decided if
we really want one or not. So, let's examine the facts
behind the flirt lax,

MH/l.‘ The nat tax is going to save you until
money,

Fact. People who lnake less than $200,000
a year wtll pay more. But, hey: you don't have to take
lny word for ll, Here's what Stanford plolcssors Rob-
on Hall and Alien Rahusllka, the people who concieved
the idea of the flat tax as proposed by Steve Forbes,
say about it. “It is all obvious mathematical law that
lower taxes on the successful will have to be made up
by higher taxes on average people."

M, The flat tax will eliminate
loopholes which allow rich people to avoid
most taxes.

Fact: The flat tax ITSELF is a
loophole: it’s only a tax on wages and pen
sions. Know what that means? Rich
people derive a ton ofincome from Invests
merits and from intclest on trust-funds,
moneyrmarkcl accounts, and such, Right
now, they pay taxes on that income. Unr
der a ﬂat tax, they won't. Once again, that
means that you and I and everyone else making under
$200,000 a year will have to shell more out to cover
what the rich will no longei be paying. And as for
millionaires not paying taxes, We currently have a pro
gram called the “alternative millimum tax" which

makes sure everyone pays in a certain amount.

Myth: The ﬂat tax is about being fair, and making
everyone pay the same for a government that benefits
everyone equally.

Facl: That statement is, quite simply, wrong at
every level. First, it flat tax isn't fair. Let’s say Mr.
Rudel works hard, and his paycheck is $100,000. And
let's say I win the Lotto, and put my money in a trust-
fund. which pays me $ 100.000 in interest every year,
Mr. Rudcl will get laxcd 20% for his $100,000, and I
won't get taxes a cent, Is that fair? The second myth
is that we should all pay into the government's coffers
at an equal rate. How ls this fair? Someone who makes
$100,000 a year can afford to part with $25,000.
$75,000 is enough to live on But someone who makes
$16,000 can scarcely afford to part with $4,000, bcr
cause it's pretty darn hard to live for $ 12,000. I'm not
saying it can’t be done. but it sure isn‘t easy, Here‘s
something else to ponder under the proposed ﬂat tax,
people making more than $200,000 get an average lax
cut of $51,000, while people making less than
$200,000 get an average tax increase ofabout $2,000
(front Citizens for Tax Justice). Is that fair',7

Myill: “If you tax high earners at a higher
rate, you are sending a clear Signal that success...wil|
be punished " Mono Charcn, Washington Time:,.Iu1y

rim.- There are two glaring problems with
statements like that one. The first ls the assumption
that “success" nleans making a lot ofmoncy. llhink
there are myriad ways to be sueeessrul without milks
ing much money at all, And i lllink that not all people
who make a lot or money are successful The sccond
problem is the assumption that a graduated tax is not
fair, Virtually no developed country ill the world has
adopted a llat tax. and 1 think the rest of the article
tells you wlly, A person who has succeeded ill our
counrty owes the country something We have pros
vidcd a soClcty in which, to a greater extent than any
other society in the world. anyone can succeed, And
when people to succeed. they need to pay back into
the system so that others can succeed. A progressive
tzix (which is what we have now) is about the rich helps
ing the poor to succeed. And. as we‘ve seen. a ﬂat tax
is about the rich looking out Ior themselves

So. let’s summarize. Herc wllui llal-tax sup-
porters say about a flat tax: 1. It makes taxation more
lair. Howls a tax cut for the rich alld a tax increase
for the poor ran-l How is only taxing payclicckcs
(which is how normal people get their money) and
not investments (which is how rich people get their
lnoney) fair? 2. It silllplilics lhe tux process, Given
that Ilalrtaxers intend to "simplify" lily taxes by [Mr

While it IS true that the flatrtax idea is not as much a
political issue this year, seeing as how neither Dole or
Clinton are proposmg one, it is of some importance due to
the differences in tax plans put forth by the candidates. Dole
speaks often about hIS desire to have a “fairer, ﬂatter tax
system," while Billy the Kid has shown a, shall we say.
greatly different predilection, First, let's debunk some
myths: 1, The ”flatrtax" is not ﬂat. In fact, let’sjust look at
some effective taerates under a flat tax. If memory serves.
Forbes was the one who advocated a 19 percent tax rate
coupled with a $38,600 personal exemption, Let’s just
take a gander at how “flat" this really is: (assume family of
four) Income:

tasstlllin FAMILY 0r Folllll

“Wow, look how much the ﬂat tax destroys the poorl"
Oh, wait it doesn‘t tax them at all (actually many will have
a negative percentage due to an earned income credit).
“Well, look how it bleeds the middle class dry!" Wait. a
household makes 50K and is only taxed zit/1.3 percent. ”The
sales tax in my home town is higher than that!" Notice that
a millionaire makes 20 times as much as someone making
50K and pays more than 80 times as much. He makes 25
times as much as someone pulling down 40K, but he pays
625 (1)35 much. Those who peddle the soak the poor! soak
the middle class rumor are demagogues facing an issue they
know they cannot defeat using facts.

2. The proposed ﬂatrtax would not send the deficit
through the ceiling. This is another scare tactic used to
defray support to the flat tax. Reagan showed that cutting
taxes can increase federal revenue. No, it won’t come over»
night, but the eighties showed that it can happen. There is
a rumor that tax revenue went down due to the tax cuts
Reagan instituted. But the facts show that the revenue from
taxes climbed 28 percent over the seven year reign of
Reagonomies (FY 82 to FY89). During that time, the
economy grew by an average of more than 4 points per
year, almost double what Clinton has been able to effect,
but I bet you didn't see that on TV. It is just one of those
facts the media does not want to let you hear. Back to the
flat tax: some estimate that the flat tax by itself would boost
economic growth by at least a full percentage point, Over a
ten year span, a boost half that size equates to a $5000 dol-
lat boast in the income of an average family of four, In
addition, Professor Dale Jorgenson of the Harvard Econom-
ics Department (you may have heard of it) says that a ﬂat
tax would boost wealth immediately by some 1 trillion dol-
lars.

One of the flat tax’s main advantages is its simplicity.
This manifests itself in many different areas. First of all,
there are thousands of multi-milllonaires who hire accounr
tants to find ways ofgetting them out ofpaying taxes. This
IS done by myriad loopholes in the present system, With a
ﬂat tax, this cannot be done. There are no crafty ways of
letting the riell ignore taxes because all the pages and pages
of IRS code have been abolished. You take what you make,
you deduct a personal allowance based only on your house-
hold size (not on your marital status) and you multiply what
is left over byl9%. Yes, this removes the charitable giving
deductions (though some flat tax plans would save these),
but if you are giving to a charity solely to get out of paying
taxes, you have a ﬁnancial genius akin to Marge Schott's
mind for public relations,

Along With making everyone pay his taxes, the ﬂat tax
cuts down immensely on the 5.4 billion hours America uses
to comply with the involute tax code. At minimum wage
this is about 27 billion dollars worth of labor each year.
This simplicity also leads to asmalleriRs, saving tax-payer
money, along wtth fewer forms, saving trees, and fewer
rules, saving headaches, This simplicity also removes the
ability of politicians to give targeted tax breaks to their
friends. A final boon ofa flat tax shows itselfin the cancel-
lation ofdouble (and sometimes triple and quadruple) taxa-
tion on income. One example of double taxation is in the
form ofdividends. Dividends are payments made by a cor-
poration to its investors. The current corporate tax ceiling
is around 39 percent. Let‘s say an upper middle class per-
son is being taxed around 30 percent under the present sys-
tem. Well, that dividend came after tax had been paid on it,
so it gets hit by a 39 percent tax and then a 30 percent tax
The Combined result is more than a 58 percent tax} There is
no reason why some income should only be taxed once and
other income taxed several times. I realize that fairness is
something lllal often doesn’t enter much ofAmerica's heart
(we are too busy crying for those people whom society has
made poor, criminal, a Perot supporter, or any other adjec-
tive of pcjoralion), but that does not mean lack the ability
to give objectivity a chance,

There is no reason why this has to be such a partisan
issue. There is no good reason to be against a flat tax (unr
less you are an accountant of government worker). The

‘ reason why liberals, in general. say they are agaillst a flat

tax is because they say it is unfair to the poor and middle
class, First of all. this statement is untrue, as I showed ear-
Iier, bui'whai could be more “fair" than having everyone
taxed equally? The real reason most liberals are against the
flat tax is because it lets more ofAmerlca keep more of its
money, and it takes away some oflhe power oflhe govemr
merit. Next week: Welfare. Send us your opinions please

Dear Editors,

In America today there are people
who sacriﬁce animals as a sacred part
of their religious tradition. Though
this may seem odd to non-practitio—
ners, and though some people may
have ethical qualms about it depend-
ing on Ihctr own beliefs, animal sac»
riﬁce does not indicate that the prac-
titioners are Satanists, evil, orinsane,
it simply means that they are per.
forming their religious obligations,
as is their right under the law and
their duty under their beliefs. People
have gone to court to protect their
rights to worship in this manner. Per-
sonally. I’m more concerned about
what people do to people in the name
of religion.

Pagans may justly wish to iden—
tify their own beliefs as not includ—
ing animal sacriﬁce. of course; we
all want our beliefs to be respected,
and one sign of respecl is understand-
ing. Still,Ithought thatI‘draise this
issue as one which had not been di-
rectly addressed.

Sincerely,
IK. Brown

RS. BeforeI geta lot ofmail from

Dear Grinnellians;

This is not a vituperative letter of
protest or complaint. I'm not writing
to condemn or accuse; on the contrary.
this is a letter of praise and congratu-
lation. Amidst the stress, frustration,
and general depression inherent to the
life ofthe woefully misnamed “aver
age” Grinnell student, we so rarely
take a moment to remember who we
are.

So, who are We? We are a come
munity ofphemomenally talented, in
telligent individuals enjoying the op-
portunity of attending one of the
country‘s toprrated liberal arts insti-
tutions. That statement contains the
purpose of this letter: to remind us,
despite the slum und drang of the
Grinnell lifestyle, that we're special
people who, with the help of our pro-
fessors and the administration, can
(perhaps even successfully) survive
college,

Ido not suggest that our lives are,
by any means, perfect, but, over the
course of those lives, we need mor
ments to acknowledge the positive as
well as the negative. I'm not some
sort of hazyreyed idealist; I realize that
many of you will read these com-
ments, roll your eyes, and retum to
studying. To you, as well as to those
of you who will read this letter and
enjoy it, Isaythankyou for your time.
good luck in your coming midsems,
and congratulations on making it this
far. I remain, respectfully yours,

Dear Editors,

As members of SDAE, we were
enthusiastic to celebrate National
Vegetarian Day and we worked very
hard putting up signs and chalking the
sidewalks. Imagine how we fell to
find our chalking defaced and every
poster on South Campus ripped
down,

It was apparent that SDAE was the
sole target of those who tore down
the signs because only ours were lit-
tering the floor of the loggia. We
think this shows complete coward-
ice and a lack of respect towards us
and our issues. We were merely try-
ing to educate the campus. We were
also totally unaware that quotations
from people like Albert Einstein and
Gandhi could be found so offensive.
One Sign consisted of a picture of
some piglets, a quotation from
Gandhi, and “Happy National Vegr
etarian Day!" Perhaps whoever took
it upon themselves to rip it down
could explain to us what's so inher-
ently offensive about that!

We would hope that whoever
committed these acts of hostility
would have the decency to express
their views in a more mature fashion
in the future.

To the Editors of the Scarlet &
Black, and to their readers:

It was a source of some pleasure to
me recently to ﬁnd prorvcgciarian pro-
paganda chalked all over the campus;
as a vegetarian. I was moved by the
zeal with which other vegetarians
wanted to spread the Word.

It was. therefore, distressing to find
responses similarly chalked near the
previous day's slogans when I went out
this morning. The least pointed oflhc
counter—chalkings read: “I’m a veg-
etarian, but that doesn‘t mean I tell
other people how to live! EAT WHAT-
EVER YOU WANT!”

I have news for the author/s of these
lines and those like them which cov-
ered the campus today: Relativism of
this sort is as worthless as ignorance.
and perhaps worse. If you don‘t eat
meat because‘you don't like the way it
tastes, then Isuppose you have a point.
albeit aweak one. If, on the other hand,
you don't eat meat because, like me,
you think that you don't have the right
to take another life just in order to feed
your face, then your belief is not sim
ply a preference. It‘s a belief in a stan-
dard, and either you or the meatreat-
ers are wrong. The slogan “Meat is
Murdel” means what it says. The sort
of thinking which goes into your
“Live-and-Iet-live" approach to vegr
etarianism is the sort of drinking which
allows holocausts. If there were a
group ofanti-lynching students, would
you tell them not to participate in the
lynchings if they didn’t like what was
going on and allow others to do as they
pleased, it being a free country and all?
No, I don't think you would. Regret—
tably, the compassion which would
enable you to make ajudgement in the
hypothetical case above does not exr
tend to your laudable choice not to dine
on the carcasses of animals who had
the same right as you or I do to live
out their lives.

In conclusion: it is time for those
of us who understand that animals
have the same rights to life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness that we all
share to stand up and tell the cami-
vores:

YOU’REWRONG! Until and un-
less we do this — precisely what the
ﬁrst chalkers took the initiative to do
7 our convictions are hollow, and we
are worse than cowards.

Dear Editor.

As a vegetarian I would like to
speak a bit about National Vegetar—
ian Day. I have been a vegetarian for
much of my life and always regarded
it as a personal choice and have never
forced my opinion upon anyone else.
Tuesday, October I, as I rode my bike
across campus on sidewalks urging
everyone who walked by to be vegr
etarian in order to “save the earth”
or “stop cruelty to animals," I
couldn‘t help but feel very exasper-
ated by the lack of knowledge most
vegetarians have about their choice.
Being of a class which can actually
rum downfoad in any form means
that we aie so much more privileged
that a lot of people in this world. I
can't count the number Oftimes I‘ve
had people at this school tell me that
if everyone in the world were veg-
etarian no one would starve. This
assumption is simply ridiculous. It’s
as ifthere is a mentality that vegetar-
ians are on a higher moral plane than
the rest of the world. Being able to
exclude meat from ourdlets because
we receive enough protein from
other sources that aren't even avail
able to much of the world 15 some-
thing all vegetarians should keep in
mind when condemning others for
slaughtering animals to keep food in
thcir stomachs. In many countries
this subject is not even an issue be-
cause ihere IS an understanding that
there are more important things in
their lives to worry about. I am very
aware of the facts and how many
people can be fed with the amount it
takes to raise an animal to feed one
person, But to deny or condemn
someone because of their choice is
wrong. I believe that someday the
world will realize that vegetarianism
could be the optimal diet for humans
living on earth, but until then we

must not impose this theory on those
who are not ready or willing to ac-
cept the vegetarian way of life.

Yes, it is a shame that so many
animals are dying, but it’s an even
bigger shame that people are dying.

sincerely,

Rachelle Green [GREENR]

Dear Scarlet and Black:

While recently relieving myself in
the Burling basement men’s bathroom,
I noticed the inanity scribbled on the
walls. Usually, I bear quite easily the
homophobic epithets, the slandering of
individuals, and the crude drawings of
naked women with bared breasts,
spread legs, and poorly rendered va-
ginas.

But, 10 and behold. for some rea-
son, this time it fell nauseous to drink
that some of my fellow-students en-
temin these thoughts and find it amus-
ing to draw a bald, naked woman pick-
ing her nose while sitting in a sexual
position, The Burling bathrooms sup-
posedly (stress supposedly please)
have a legacy for entenaining and cre-
ative Scribblings. But no, not of re-
cently, Now (at least in the men's bath-
room) it is crude, disgusting, stupid,
idiotic. ignorant, and vile crap. Person-
ally, I‘m all for free expression, but not
at the expense of others; not when it is
humiliating or purposer offensive and
hurtful. To whomever wrote and drew
such banal and decrepit stuff. enjoy
your anonymity and your ignorance,
and in the fume. please keep it to your-
self.

To the Campus Community:

This weekend the ﬁlms conunittec
will be showing the movie Leaving lat
Vegas as a prelude to Alcohol Aware-
ness and Education Week on campus.
The ﬁlm presents a very sensitive por-
trayal of a man who is caught in the
grips of alcohol addiction. and it at-
tempts to show the tragedy of such an
addiction.

Alcohol awareness week is a na-
tionally recognized week on many col-
lege campuses and universities around
the country. During die week, schools
attempt to provide students with many
positive choice options regarding al-
cohol as well as providing tips which
lead to responsible drinking,

Because the National Collegiate
Alcohol Awareness Week (NCAAW)
falls during Grinnell’s fall break, stu~
dents working with the Student Health
and Wellness Committee (SHAVI) are
trying to establish a week proceeding
fall break which can be devoted to pro-
moting alcohol awareness and educa-
tion on campus. If you are interested
in being part of this planning process.
or if you have suggestions that you
would like to offer to the committee,
please vax [CSI-IIEALTI-I].

Leaving Las- Vegas will be show-
ing this Friday evening in the North
Lounge at 8:30 pm. and this Saturday
evening in the Harris Cinema at 7:30
pm. Hope to see you there!

Dear Editors:

I am the newest newcomer to
the Grinnell community, and I aI~
most didn’t send this letter be-
cause the Scarlet & Black was so
kind to me last week with all your
fine coverage.

Then I realized that. as the
Asian American “minority
scholar»in-residence,“ part of my
teacherly duty is to be witness
and watchdog. I am concerned
about anti»Asian attitudes played
out in “The Adventures of Pleigh-
Dough Marl."

Not only does PleighrDough
Man have stereotypical slanted
eyes and a Charlie Chan body, he
uses Kung Fu to battle “NinjaAs-
sassins” — an affront to Chinese
and Japanese heroic tradition. I
hope I have not worn out my wel-
come with this letter. since I feel
especrally honored to be at
Grinnell. but with that honor
comes responsibility, and I hope
we will all be responsible when
it comes to avoiding stereotyping
others.

Sincerely.
