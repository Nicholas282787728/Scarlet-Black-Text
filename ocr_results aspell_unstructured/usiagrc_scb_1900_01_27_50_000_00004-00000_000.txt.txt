The two associations have suc»
ceeded in securing Graham Toy

ary it. He will likely speaktlvice
on Sunday and in all probability
will hold some special meetings
during the day.

Miss Stella Bartlett has very
kindly consented to take charge
ofthe Normal Bible class, which
will meet at her home every Sate
urday at mg. The association
surely extends to Miss Bartlett
its sincere thanlrs for thus taking
charge of so important a part of
its work.

Tile students of Columbia Uni-

versity decided, at a mass meeting
held recently, to consolidate the
various athletic associations.
‘ The value ot gymnasium work
is sliown by the following examiv
nations made at the University of
Michigan. Betore entering the
gymnasium classes in the fall and
again betore leaving them in the
spring, every freshman is exam-
ined. and a class average is ob-
tained from the sum of all the in-
dividual measurements. The class
of 1902 is the ﬁrst so far examined,
the measurements being 32 9-23
per cent. at the ﬁrst examination,
and 55 per cent. at the second.
