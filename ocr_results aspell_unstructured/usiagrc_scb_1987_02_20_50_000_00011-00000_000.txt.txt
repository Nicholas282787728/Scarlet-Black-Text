Veritcts Pride

 

by Dave Nelson and
Eric Schneider

The glitch is gone. The pride is back.
Week two of die S.I. season saw Hie Veritas
program work to precision, successiully
forecasting the outcome oi all 14 games.
Prognostication was greatly aided by the
beginning oi conierence play, as the top
teams ﬂattened the bottom teams in each
conference.

The 21 5,1. squads are divided into three
seven-club conferences. These three divi-
sions are cleverly named the Big 10. the
ACC, and the Big East. The Veritas Cone
ference Power Program acknowledges the
Big East as the toughest division with an
overall power score at 205.2. This con—
ierence appears to be ruled by Omar and
the Pharaohs. but the uptempo GSMAS is
known to have no respect {or authority,
and the Fuzzy Balls are another team
which could cause a racket. With only
seven teams, the Big 10 generated no.4
cps (conierence power score). The Big 2 in
the Big in are the deicnding champs, PMS
and the up-andcoming Men oi Pause. The
weak sister conierence, the ACC, limped in
with a meager 151.8 cps. AIDS is the top
gun of this division; only the Pink Flam-
ingos may have the formula to hinder their
spread.

The game of the week, a rematch of last
year’s championship between PMS and
LSD, was a big downer. The ghosts of
LSD's past could not help LSD present
keep PMS oif the boards. As PMS pounded
LSD, 6548, we realized this was a poor
choice [or the game of the week, and our
attention quickly turned to the south court
where Faculty-Staff was giving a dissere
taion on the execution of the delay game.
With five minutes remaining and an eight-
point lead, Faculty switched their
allegiance irom Dean Frazer to Dean
Smith, and instead oi piling it on, they

slowed down the pace. Taking advantage
of the nnrshot-clock and nD-backcourt SI
rules, Facultystafl froze the Snowballs’
Chance. 43-30.

Except {or a iew minor adjustments,
this week‘s Veritas 15 is the same as last
week's.

Taking to the waters once again this past
weekend, the men’s swim team showed the
rest of the Competition who was THE team
to beat. Grinnell easily drowned the other
teams to win their llth straight Iowa Small
College State Championships in 11 years.
(What an amazing record!) Grinnell led
with 146 points, while their closest coma
petitar, Luther, was well behind in second
place with 96 points.

Winners lor the Pioneers included Kyle
Torque in the so iree, Darek Bushnaq in
the 200 breast stroke (he also had a
6-second time drop), Jim Redlern in the
500 free. and the 400 medley relay team oi
Torn Welander, Bushnaq, Tim
Laughinghouse, and Paul Froese. Coach
Ray Obermiller noted that a big reason tor
the team's victory was the overall depth,
as Grinnell placed many swimmers in
crucial second, third-, and fourthrplace
spots. Obermiller ieels that the Buddha ln-

Vitational will also be a good meet [or the
team; it is the team’s linal regular season
meet before the conference meet on March
5m, Says Obermiller, “This next meet,
we're just trying to get psyched icr con-
ference and to get our best times of the
yeari”

The swimmers also feel pleased about
their efforts and what lies ahead in die
Buddha Invitational. Said Froese. "We
kicked butt last weekend and we will kick
butt again this weekend." Echoing Ober-
miller's comments was junior Torque, who
commented that “We’re not really going in
to win, but we’re still psyching ourselves
up for ﬁle meet. At last weekend's meet
God was against us with all the religious
schools Competing, but in the end, Buddha
proved to be the more successiul Deity!"
Responding to these comments was
freshman Kevin Doerschug, quoted as say-
ing “Just what Kyle said."

In all three meets, the Pioneers turned in
some impressive periormances. Against

Grinnell’s favor. Grinnell placed a number
