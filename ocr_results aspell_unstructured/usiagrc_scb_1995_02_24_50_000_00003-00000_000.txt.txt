work every Tuesday dinner as a
I runner at Quad. This is the time

that I get to discuss the content
ofthe 3&3 with the paper’smosi
faithful reader, Sandy Gulick,
Quad student employee superVi-
sor. Last Tuesday, Sandy dee
cided to commenton Anne Gay‘s
letter to the editor in the Feb. 17
edition. In her letter, Gay said
that she was “horribly disap-
pointed" by my column two
weeks ago concerning problems
with the label “Generation X,”
Gay explained laterinthe article
that the issue was not “current"
alid that “I know Mr. Horn can
do better irhc tries otherwise
hc'sjust proving his little editoe
rial is wrong."

Sandy thought it was wrong
for Gay to write what she did.
”You’re Just doing something
that interests you." Sandy ex-
plained to me. “What right does
she have to criticize that?"

“She’s entitled to her opin-
ions," I replied.

As a matter of fact, I was
rather happy to see Gay‘s letter.
It proved to me two things. First.
someone other than Sandy and
my close friends actually reads
my little weekly opinions and
commentary in the 5&3. Sec-
ond (and most important), after
reading the column, someone

thought aboutii. Getting people
to think is perhaps the greatest
achievement a columnist can
accomplish through his or her
writing.

Getting students to think is
something the 5&3 had not been
dotng, For a while, the 5&8
would not publish columns and
personal opinions, Some past
editors saw the newspaper al-
most exclusively as an informa
tion and entertainment source.
The onlyeditorialsthaiappeared
were staff editorials which
lacked bite. (It‘s hard enough to
get a newspaper staff to agree on
toppings for a pizza, let alone to
agree on an opinion.) The .9428
gave people something to read,
but it didn't provide the campus
community anything to think
ubouL

This semester, Editor in
Chief Riva Sharples decided to
packthe paperwith columns and
editorials. Suddenly, the opin-
ions on campus have been given
a voice. Students are thinking.

This week, Sports Editor
Chris Pallas has written an edi~
torial which questions the role
of multiculturalism, the means
through which it operates and
the goals of the movement. His
argumentisstrong. It mighteven
make you question some ofyour
beliefs on the Subject. You can
find this editorial on page 7.

 

 

SESQUICENTENNIALfmmp, 1
50th anniversary, thecollege published
the Blue Book, containing essays and
illustrations by members ofthe ﬁrst 50
graduatingclasscs, IIICOIUUHCHOH with
the 150th anniversary, the college is
combining submissions by members
of the most recent 50 classes with
materials from the ﬁrstBlue Book into
an updated edition.

Besides these, a calendar, cel-
ebration booklet, newsletter, painte
ings ofcampus scenes by art profes-

sor Bob McKibbin and posters and
notecards of these paintings are be
ing produced,

All told, the next two years will
hold busy and exciting times at
Grinnell.

“This is uuly a benchmark oc»
casion,"Moyerstated. “Thecollege
has come a long way in 150 years,
and especially in the past 50 years.

it this far and look toward the fu-
ture."

 

PAPER from page 1
”This increase could jump
prices up five percent or more,"
Frazee said. “It just depends on
the book and what [expenses]
went into printing it, We’re see—
ing a 30»pcrcenl price increase
for our paper products right now.
Ofcourse, there’s more that goes
into manufacturing a book than
just buying the paper. We have
production costs, editorial costs
[and other things], so the con-
sumer won't feel a 30 percent
increase in price or anything.”
By Frazee’s calculations,
textbooks next semester might
cost as much as an additional five
dollars per book, When you're
buying more than one book,

Frazec noted, that could start to
add up,

Cassie Johnson, business
manager at the Grinnell College
Bookstore, said that bookstore
employees haven‘tseen too many
students stocking up on extra
paper, despite warnings about the
increase. One or two students did
come in this week to buy paper
products before the increase.
Prices will go up, Johnson said,
as soon as the current supplies
are depleted and shelves are ree
Stocked.

As one bookstore employee
put it, though: “I think we‘d
have more ofa reaction from stu-
dents if there was a shortage of
Laffy Taffy!"
