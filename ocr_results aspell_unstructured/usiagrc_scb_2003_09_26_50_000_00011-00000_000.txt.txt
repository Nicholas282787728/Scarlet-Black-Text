diversity

The Council class orzoo7 claims 12% domesticstudeiits orcolor.
This large percent is a testament to Griiinell's droit to increase the
diversity or the student body However, is this physically obvious
characteristic the only diversityweare openly [:Cugmzmg?wlm[ about
the hidden lines orsocial class?

A sense ordrrrerence and alienation is not restricted to color or
racial/ethnic social identity in general, students hem white working
class familio and rirst generation college goers are invisible even though
they contribute to diversity on campus and they orten laek Familial
and ﬁnancial support given to their counterparts that make up the
maiority ofcollcge strideno.

“Pretty much once a semester I see one student or more from a
lionvanuenr background,“ aoied Poweshiek County Mental Health
center psychologist Harriet Dickeychaoiirs ’82, Ph 1)., “They or
ten reel pretty alienated and different from the othei students. it’s
haid for them to know who else comes horn similar rinancral basic
ground, A lot orsrudeiits take their atilirenee rot gmnted and that
orren uncomrortablc for students who arcii'i ailiuenr,”

with tree events and little else to do on campus, Grinnellians
rarely demonstrate their 5.
nancial status. Even in small

Nonetheless, there are stu—

Familial resources given to _—
those students who come
horn a long line orcollege graduates. First generation students may
even free parental resistance to their attendance. For some, attend.
ing crinnell creates alienation irom childhood friends.

in a study done this year by centiiiy Foundation on college nde
missions, only 3 percent orrhe student body at the nation's top 146
colleges come from ramilics iepi-esenting the bottom socioeconomic
quartile as dehned by Family incorric, parental education and even
neighborhood amucnce. only lo percent represent the bottom half
socioeconomically,

considering that 5.9 percent orctmiicll’s class orzoo7 are first
generation college students, Grinnell should better recogniie and
vice all students horn disadvantaged backgrounds. Whether rm. ne
cially, academically, culturally. oi socially, orinncll students deserve
the resources and istance that will help them achieve their best in
theii-roiiryeais here. social class diversityenhances ihe education of
everyone and developing an awareness oiissues ielated to chaos differ
ences is important for everyone.

in order to answer this call for help, three students, armed with
questions and statistiaaboutour peer institutions, are woiking with
the administrati i and Faculty to bring about better awareness and
support. Recogriiving thatstudcnrs rrom a working class background
may orten reel alienated, we hope to take their personal problems

and better articulate them in an open, supportive college Commu-

Strategic
to respond

An email was sent aieund to all students last week about a stia.
tegic Planning document. Given that about only 20 students at inarie
mum have responded with comments to this document at the time i
am writing l'rri going to assume that most students didn’t spend too
much time goingovci it. I’d like to encourage every Griiiriellian to at
least read the document and think about responding,

These documents are being produced by a committee charged
with planning for the college in the most long term sense. This
group is trying to hgure out what “strategies" 6. much should pinsue
to achieve its mission. The spceirie document referenced in the c-
mail is the product or locus groups that included students, raculty,
start and alumni. The speciric strategies olrered in the document
have to do with the entire ctinnell experience. That's a little abstract
_ let me be more speciﬁc,

The possible stiatcgies
articulaied have a iange that
includes both going tome
plcrcly tuition.hec or me

aback by this, but theic re.
ally is a strategy that would
gerridortuirioii Additional
options listed propose the
conﬂicting suggestions or
“loinphauieingxeaching, Monte. mg and small Group Research 0pc
poinrriities" and stmiegies ihat could lead to “larger classes," “fewer
courses" and “potentially less access to faculty." There are all these
suggestions iheir possible effect: and more. This dociimeni (and the
planning piocess that produced it) is ioeiising on core aspectsororiii.
nell that affect all aspects ora students experience here.

I am not writing this to create hysteria. This letter is not trying to
point out a conspiracy in the making. Rather, i hope that as you read
this you had that maybe it is worth your while to take a look at the
documents and ihink about adding your comments to the hay. Cert

Certainly, the Stragetic
Planning Process would
be better if more than
20 students commented.

Presidental
candidate
stumbles

'Ben Jacobs

in the park across the street from the iowa Memorial union,
where Wesley Clark would speak yesterday, a group of Clark sup»
porters had set up a table and began to gather for hours before the
speech was scheduled to occur. They came from places as far as Okla.
homa city to witness the ﬁrst majorsrop on their candidates cam.
paign They described General Clark glowingly as “a real progressive
and a real patriot." He was “a breath otrrcsh air," an ouoider candie
date with esperiencc both in the military and in investment banking,
which gave him security and economic credentials. one orthem had
been so devoted that he drove several hundred miles rrom his home
in st. loiiit to piornote Clatks candidacy in east Tennessee. They
had all united in viewing Claik as an antiwar candidate who was
“genuine and thoughttul," After waiting months for General Clark
to declare as candidacy as active members orthe Dtart Clark move
ment, they were excited that their candidate had ﬁnally started to
campaign. They had believed in Clark's candidacy long before Clark
hllnselfdid.

However, they found little to spread the Faith in Clark's much
awaited speech yesterday. The Dean orLaw school warned the over»
ﬂow audience of mostly seniors and students that they would not
hear a campaign speech in his introduction to Genentl Clark’s talk.
instead, they would be treated to a “conventional university lecture,"
As Clark got tip to speak, the eiithusiaotic crowd greeted him with a
thunderous ovation Clark then pi-occeded to dampen their enthusie
asin by delivering such a conventional university lecture that some
members orthc audience dosed on.

Clark’s speech started with the thesis that the United states had
been lerr coniused in die post Cold War world, stating that the United
states “won the cold war, but lost our sense ersti-ategy." Clark then
most intriguingly olrercd as an example of“ruddcrlcss roreign policy"
not the Bush administration but the first few years ordie Clinton
