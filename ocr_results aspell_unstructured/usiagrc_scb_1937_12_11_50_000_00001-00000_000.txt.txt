Considering
New Quiz Plan

Will Be Recommended to
Faculty if Approved by
Group.

“Extremely interesting." wasl
the comment of Paul Spencer-
Wood, professor of English and
chairman of the faculty etlucaa
tioiial committee, upon the new
quiz plan brought up tor discus
sion before the group Wednes-
day.

Wood stated that the plan is
“revolutionary," and explained
that the committee will consider
it thoroughly before anything
definite is done.

The proposed plan, originated
by three seniors, Harold Squire.
Charles Wirt and Roy Jensen,
was designed to eliminate all an-
nounced and final examinations,
substituting unannounced quizzes.
given at irregular intervals at
the instructors' discretion, The
last week of the semester would
be used as a correlation and sum-
mation period,

Wood pointed out that, if the
committee approves the plan, it
will be recommended to the fac-
ulty whose next meeting will be
soon after the Christmas holi-
days,

He asserted that the plan obvi-
ously has merit, and added that
such a system would probably
raise rather than lower Grinnell's
educational standards. He said
he was particularly pleased that
it was formulated by members
of the student body.

According to Squire, the pur-
pose ot the program oi quizzes
lather than examinations is to
eliminate cribbing and cram-
ining and to establish a basis by
which grades will better repre-
sent the students' actual knowl.
edge of the courses.

Every Eligible Man on
Squad to Make Trip to
Iowa State.

By Wells IL Barnett

The‘Ploneer eagers will play
their third straight non—conference
game of the season Monday when
they will travel to Ames to meet
Iowa State college. Every eligie
ble man on the squad will make
the trip, according to Coach John
Truesdale.

On the basis of record alone,
the Pioneers chances for victory
look very bright, inasmuch as
the Iowa State boys went down to
defeat before Cornell last night
by a 2346 score And the Cy-
clones had a lot of trouble
nosing out Simpson by a two-
point margin not long ago.

Iowa State has been forced this
year to rely on tour sophomores,
all of them from Ames high's
championship high school team of
two years ago. However, with
only one old hand, Blahnik. to
steady the newcomers, it is likely
that the youngsters will be very
unpredictable, and the chances
are that Grinnell's veteran team
Will have an edge.

However, the pioneers are go~
ing to have to be better than they
were last night against One to
turn the trick, there ware a num-
ber of aspects of the Pioneer
play which were unsatisfactory,
particularly their inability to work
plays and get the ball into the
basket. And the defensive work
at times looked very bad.

The Pioneers work under a
definite handicap this year, her
cause our small gymnasium makes
it ditficult to work on the high
speeds of which they should be
capable ,and any Grinnell team
is handicapped when tt must play
at a school with a regulation
size floor. Truesdale. however,
expected to stress fast-breaking
and speed in the practice session
this afternoon which will be the

Athletic—Policy to
Be Delined Sunday

Misapprehensions Cause
Athletes, Committee to
Discuss Withdrawal.

Grinnell college athletes will
meet with members of the faculty
athletic committee and the ath-
letic department tomorrow night
to hear an explanation of Grin-
nell's athletic policy. it was an-
nounced today by John Truesdale,
director of athletics.

The meeting will be held in the
men's gymnasium at 10:00 p. in.
Truesdale said. under
the direction of Earl D. strong,
chairman of the taculty athletic
committee.

Truesdalc stated that it was
thought desirable to hold such a
meeting because of the widespread
misapprehensions which had arisen
regarding the athletic policies of
the college as a result of Grin-
neli's withdrawal from the Mis—
souri Valley conference, which
was announced last Friday at a
conference meeting at Kansas
City, Mo.

it was felt by members of the
committee that it would be wise
to inform athletes as to Gtin~
neull's athletic policy before they
return to their homes for Christ—
mas recess Friday. in order that
the doubts and misapprehensions
which, are rife here may be clear-
ed up, and so that the men may.
be able to explain the school’s
stand intelligently at their home
towns. Strong will have charge
of explaining the policy.

Immediately after the main
meeting. Coach Guy Lookabaugh
will ask football men to remain
for a separate meeting in which
they will take up various angles
of their own particular situation
Truesdale said.
