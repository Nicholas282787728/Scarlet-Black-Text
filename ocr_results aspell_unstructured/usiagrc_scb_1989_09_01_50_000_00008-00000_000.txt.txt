SWEET GRINNELL

Continuedfrom p. 4

“Uh,my name is Donna—Ihavea
1:30 appointment, but we had talked
about arranging a tour.,.?“

“0h 7 yeah.“ (Snap, crackle, pop
went her Bazooka.) “As soon as Mr,
O’Connor gets in, he can help you.“
At this point, a man seated atthe desk
next to this woman clears his throat
and introduces himself do us? to her?
do these people worktogetlier’l): “I‘m
Dennis O‘Connor. Won’t you girls
come into my office?"

As we settled into the swivel chairs
across from Dennis,hecasually asked
us a simple question: “So, where do
you girls go to school?“ “Grinnell
College, sir. It’saboutSOOmiles from
here, in Grin—"

“Uh, yes, I‘ve heard of your colr
lege." Instant cloud across his face.
“So why did you girls come to visit
us?" That‘s odd, I thought, as Donna
began explaining tothis man that she
had made an appointment with him
about a week before, in the hopes of
transferring to his college. Maybe
I’m all confused aboutthese matters.
but shouldn‘t he be hitting her with
the 'ole “Come to my college 7
we’re great” speech? Especially in
this case 7 Donna sought him out,
afterall,Heck,thisvisitwasa1readya
little out of hand, what more should
we expect?

Funny thing that I thought that.
Donna hadjust asked Dennis to tell
her a little bit about his college. His
reply'.7 “I don't know what to tell you
about my college." Yes, folks, that’s

a verbatim quote. Unbelievable.
Lookingback now, I guess I feel kind
of sorry for this guy. He hadjust dug
a six-foot hole for himself. For one
thing, I didn’t want to see one of my
best friends transfer away from Grin-
nell,butforanother,lcertainlydidn‘t
wanthertoendupatthisguy’sschool.
So we did it. We ripped on him.

The rest of our 20-minute inter—
view went something like this: “30,
Dennis, what’s your endowment?"

“0h, about 11 million. Grinncll is
right up there with us, isn’t it?"

“Well, gee, Dennis, last time I
Checked it was well in excess of 290
million," Gulp, sputter, choke from
Dennis, We felt no mercy.

“How ‘bout your prof acme/dida—
tions, Dennis?“

“Well,about70%ofourprofessors
have their Ph.D’s.” (85% of Grin-
nell‘s professors have doctorates.)

“Well then, how about your stu-
dent/prof ratio?”

“19 to 1 7 pretty good." Not re-
ally. Grinnell‘s is 10 to 1. Nice try.
“So, Dennis. do you hold convocar
lions? And if you do, who were some
of the gueSt lecturers?“

“Oh, yes" (wait — is that enthusi-
asm we sec?), “we hold two convoca-
tions a week, and many of the big
Minneapolis-St. Paul business lead»
ers speak to our students." We didn’t
bother informing him thatGrinnell’s
list of speakers included former Sec-
retary of Defense Robert S. Mc»
Namara and Strobe Talbott, editor of

your budget?"

“4.2 million." 0h. Grinnell spent
3.5 million in renovations alone sev-
eral years back.

And now for the big one7 Donna
and I love telling this story: “So.
Dennis, how is your college rated?”

“What do you mean?"

“Oh, for instance, Grinnell was
ranked 7th in the nation by US News
and World Report as being an out-
standing liberal arts college, just last
year." Poor guy7he walked right
into that one.

“Well," he began to ﬂounder, “I
really don‘t have much faith in those
surveys, but I know that we were
ranked 7th in the nation in something
last year, also." No joke, folks; I’ll
swear on anything — he really and
truly said that.

The interview lasted about 30 sec»
onds after that. Need I even add that
we never received a tour. nordid they
ever hear from either of us again? I
guess that my whole point in writing
this article is just to give you a little
idea of what else is out there. Yes, I
am biased. because I am a Grinnel-
lian. But even if you were to doalitde
of your own “comparison shopping,”
I‘m sure that you’d realize, too, that
Grinnell is about as good as it gets.

FIBER—OPTIC CABLE

Continuedfrom p. I

said Bill Francis, director of Com
puting Services

Second, the new cables will in—
crease the speed of the communicate
tion by 1,000 times, to 10,000,000
bitspersecond. In addition, the high
capacity of the FDDI cables will
require no major reconstruction for
further cabling as computer tech-
nology continues to expand and
grow.

Another incentive for installing
the FDDI system was that it will
allow students and staff members
working on a computer terminal
immediate access to the library’s
card catalog, in order to determine
whether the library carries a cenain
periodical or book. Francis said that
although the cables have been laid
and the system is ready to be put to
use. the library staff is “still work-
ing on their end of things before we
hook up” the system

Until the library staff is ﬁnished

ers, except for those in the math and
psychology departments, will re-

main hooked up with the old sys»
tem.

This summer, two main "legs” of
cable were laid, with both of the
mainhook-upsrunningoutofDarby.
The first leg connects Darby Gym-
nasium with the Science Building,
the Forum and Burling Library. The
second formsastringfromDarby to
ARH, Carnegie, Steiner, Goodnow
and the Fine Arts Building. Hopes
for the near future are to include
Mears Cottage in the path, so that a
Sun Lab may be hooked up in the
Math Laboratory, and to install sev-
eral Macintosh and PC computers
on the system in the Carnegie termi-
nal room.

Asa long-term goal, Francis hopes
to be able to use the fiber optic
cables to transmit foreign broad-
casts from a satellite dish on top of
ARI-I to the Forum. However, there
is a standard hookrup which must
first be set before using the FDDI
“hardware" to run video signals to
the Forum. In the meantime, over-
seas telecasts will be seen only in
ARH upon the completion of the
building’s renovations.

beingasoldierand relegateyou tothe
less prestigious terrorist club?

Thecaseisoften made thataterror-
ist is someone who “cowardly” at-
tacks civilian targets instead of mili-
tary ones. Didn’t U.S. bombers and
gunboats attack Tripoli, a city wrth a
large civilian population? Don’t Is-
raeli bombers routinely (at least nine
missionstltismonth) bombareaswith
large civilian populations with little
strategic value? The boys with the
guns can shootwith impunity, but the
boys with rocks are terrorists.

The most shocking aspect of the
whole grisly business is that we can»
not understand why people attack
American targets. We use economic
and military force to keep othercoun-
tries in unfavorable relationships with
us; they don‘t have the same options.
When less economically developed
countries use the weapons at their
disposal to ﬁghtback, we call them
“terrorists" 7 twisted justiﬁcation
for ourbombing oftheirciviliansand
usurpation of their sovereignty.

Oddly enough, there is a correla-
tion between our foreign policy and
the level of terrorism in the world. In
the 70’s, when PresidentCarter was
working to secure MiddleEastpeace,
there was a marked decline in the
level of “terrorism" (with the excep—
tion of the aforementioned fairy tale).
During the eighties however, inter»
national peace effons were minimal,
American ties to Israel were strength-
ened, and American recognition of
Other interests in the region waned;
“terrorism" rose markedly. Perhaps
if we reevaluate and modify our poli-
cies so as to recognize the legitimate
concerns of all nations “terrorism"
will dry up entirely.
