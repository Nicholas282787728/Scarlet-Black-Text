Who is Changing,
Grinnell or us?

Many students come to Grinnell

sight unseen," Yet many or us
were attracted here by such things
as the School's tine academic
reputation. the fact that there were
no fraternities or sororities here
and the less than “C" grade erase
ystem. In general, Grinnell's
most attractive feature is Its
uniqueness.

Gl'lnnell is a changing ins
stltution Since only in change is
there progress. this is a good thing.
Yet such changes as the cessation
of an “official" Skip Day and the
elimination oi creditrerase system
as we know it. are changes which
only lead to Conformity. So the
college is faced with the dilemma
oi tiniling the happy medium
between uniqueness and progress.

SOME Min" ARGL'E that the
school‘s plans are only
modifications necessary in Corr
tinuing progress Others ot us may
View lhese modifications as too
drastic. These modifications seem
indicative of the growing trend in
this country toward conservatism

Contrastingly it may he argued
that each ot the three incoming
freshman classes has marked a
y'ear's growth tor us That is to say.
they have shown us how much we
have grown in comparison to when
we were freshmen.

Allin all. Grinnell has taught us
many things. and not just in the
classroom in tact many ot us have
learned more outside the
classroom than inside. It has been
questioned. what does a liberal
arts education prepare me tor.
besides more education? Yet if we
have learned to deal with and
accept people and if we have been
able to broaden our perspectives.
then we have accomplished much
Much lhat “ill always aid and
support us in all our endeavors.
This has a lot to do with what a
liberal arts college education is all
about. The Grinnell EX-
PERIENCE

In the years to come Grinnell
College will continue to there Our
school will perpetually be
changing Changing not only to
keep pace with the educational
needs of society but to keep pace
with the world. We should all be
proud that \AC passed this way,
