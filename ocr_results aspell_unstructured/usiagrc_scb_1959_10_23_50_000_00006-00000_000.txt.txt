Three TD's In Four’rh Period

by Steve Alarms

Grinnell’s freshman football
team jelled last Friday to give
the "baby’ Pioneers a no vic-
tory over Knox. Still burning
from a 12—0 loss to Care the pre—
vious week, the frosh used solid
line play, an alert pass defense,
and an explosive offense to
’make their first victory as rout.

The first half was oomparr
tively quiet as Grinnell and
Knox took turns threatening.
In the ﬁrst quarter Gtinnell
crossed the double<sfripe on
the first of two An Petersom
to-Genc Kowert passes. The
score had been set up by Carl
Pearson’s interception and
fullback to tho Knox 26 yard-
line. The extra point was
Wide, and the hall ended 6-0,
Grinnell.

During the halftime the fresh.
men made some adjustments in
their offense, and the second
half was all Grinnell. After an
exchange of the ball, Howard
Dunn made a sparkling 69ayard
touchdown run behind crushing
downfield blocking. Kowert’s
extra point was good, and Grin-
hell was on its way, 13-0.

in the fourth quarter the
fresh exploded for three touch-
downs. A pass—run combination,
Peterson to Kowert, covered 61
yards to score. Minutes later

Grinnell capped a 61-yard drive
with a 26-yard scoring pass to
Steve ‘Aldrich, and the point
was good. During the march
Dunn gained as yards.

Seconds after the kickoff,
Jim Fisher intercepted an
errant Knox 11355 and scam-
pered down the sidelines for
18 yards and the ﬁnal Mulch-
down.

Coach John Pfitsch said after
the game, “The team improved
greatly between games, espec—
ially in poise and teamwork."

Looking especially good or.
rensively were Dunn with 153
yards gained, and Art Peterson,
who mixed his plays well,
passed for three touchdowns,
and averaged six yards per
carry. Kowert caught two
touchdown passes, kicked two
extra points, and played good
derense from his corner-hack
position,

Carl Peterson was alert on
defense with two pass intercep-
tions and averaged 5.75 yards
per carry. Co~captain John
Corns again led a standout line
which blocked effectively and
limited Knox to 2.5 yards per
attempt

Today the freshman Pioneers
travel to Cedar Rapids for a
rematch with Coe, looking for
revenge of the previous loss.
