This isa fztilly good showing
considering the number of rrrerr
that are available. But there are
still several new men who have
the rcquisitcs for football men,
but who have not yet donned
their suits. To these men the
iootball management extends an
urgent invitation to get out at
once and receive the beneﬁt of
this early training.

Enrollment.

Thc deﬁnite enrollment (or this
Fall cannot be given at present as
there are always some students
who arrive too late to register the
ﬁrst week, but the approximate
number is as follows: Seniors,
torty; Juniors, twentyrsevcn;
Sophomores, ninety-Six; Freshr
men, oncrhundred and nine;
Academy, seventyrsevch; Conserr
vatory. sixtyronc. Those who are
familiar with the number of stu-
dents in the different Classes last
year will notice that the present
Senior and Junior classes are
much smaller than they were then.
This is explained by the fact that
quite a large number or those who
will graduate with either the
Senior or Junior class are rcgisten
ed as Sophomores becausc ota
deﬁciency in academy work. In
general the enrollment will be
about what it was last year.

 

The Opening Chapel.

The ﬁrst devotional scrvices of-
tlre neiv year were held chnes
day morning at the regular hour
in the college chapel. Tire audr
ence was of very satisfactory size,
there being as many present as
the room could comfortably nee
Commodzlte. After a short glectr
ing to the students by President
Main, Rev. Boardman, pastor oi
the First Congregational Church
of Marshalltowil, was introduced
as the principal Speaker. As a
text for his talk Mr. Boardnian
chose the scripture passages Cone
taining the temptations of Christ
in the wilderness. In these verses
hc lourrd mtlcll oi encouragement
for those who have made their de-
cision as to their life work. He
showed a parallel between the
temptations of Christ and the all
too prevalent desire among young
people to enter active profession-
al lite betore they are prepared
in the best possible manner. The
man witha mission, he said, is
never in a hurry, for being Comes
before doing, Christ had His
mission and we have ours, So
let us rclusc its He did to embark
upon our mission until we are
thoroughly prepared.

In the audience were seen an
exceptionally large proportion of
strange faces, those of the new
students, to whom a cordial greet-
ing is extended.

Talk by Mr. Douglass.

In response to the request oi
Librarian Douglass, a large numr
beroi Freshmen met in the library
this morning. The purpose otthe
meeting wastoi instruction in the
use oi the card Catalogue and in
the usage ot the books in the
library.

The system or cataloging was
demonstrated by actual work of
the librarian, who went through
the process of looking up a book,
The freshmen showed theirappre-
Ciation at this instruction by a
large attendance and by their
close attention.
