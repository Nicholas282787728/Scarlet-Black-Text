For traditional and modern jazz lovers
alike, Saturday’s performance of the
Akiyoshi/Tabackin Band promises ‘to be
one of the highlights of this semester’s cnnr
certs program, '

The seventeen piece band, voted the
number one big band by both the Critics'
and Readers' Poll of Downbeat magazine,
features authentic Bop Era jazz with a
depth of style rarely found in today's large
jazz bands.

Unlike previous Grinnell jazz concerts,
no tickets for Saturday’s performance will
be distributed. However, students must
present a college ID. at the doors of
Roberts, which will open at 7 pm. The
band will play only one concert, but it will
consist of two sets, allowing listeners a
healthy dose of good solid music.

Japanese composer and director
Toshiko Akiyoshi is an accomplished
pianist whose big band arrangements br-
ing out all the essentials of bop music e a
full sax sound, a sharp brass section and a
steady “pulse” which underlies meter
variations. while Akiyoshi enriches her
compositions with classical and Oriental
elements, the end result is a composition
which comes closer to the true essence of
jazz than most “standard” American jazz
creations,

Akiyoshi‘s husband, Lew Tabackin, who
got his start on the “Tonight Show” band,
is a first»rate tenor saxophonist and flutist
who adds spark and color to the music as
the band’s primary soloist.

Featured at Carnegie Hall and acclaim
ed by music critics the world over, the
Akiyoshi/Tabackin band is a “beautifully
textured ensemble” and should entertain
all listeners.

Arthur ﬂ (1982, 105 min.)

An entertaining film, starring Dudley
Moore and Liza Minnelli, Arthur is the
story of a drunken millionaire playboy
finally forced to marry after years of being
nannied by his stoic valet and confidant,
Hobson. “

The film documents Arthur's relation-
ship with Linda, the “working girl” who is
entranced by his endearing childishness,
as well as his more distant rapport wiui his
rich and unspontaneous fiancee.

John Gielgud, as Robson, steals the show
by delivering his dry lines with a twinkle of
Warmth and understanding. Likewise,
Dudley Moore adds to his character all the
spice and charm that could be desired,
Liza Minnelli as Linda, however, appears
less suited to her role — it is difficult to
gain an understanding of her character,
and her performance is either too strong or
nonexistent.

Arthu is nota great film but is certainly
enterta ' g and well worth the time.

Badlands — (1974, 95 min.)

A film about two young pathologically
detached murderers, Kit Carruthers and
Holly Sargis, Badlands is today’s chilling
and remorseless response to Bonnie and
Clyde.

Starring sissy Spacek and Martin sheen,
Badlands documents the murder binge of
the duo which leaves no one in their lives
(or paths) untouched.

The narration, provided by Spacek, suc-
cessfully expresses the unfeeiing mentali-
ty of the characters' actions and outlook.

in spite of its gruesome subject matter,
Badlands offers expert acting and impec-
cable coherence in its character develop-
ment.

It is a commendable effort by a young
production team and a film which should
be appreciated. if for no other reason than
its representatlan of the muffled hysteria
of the two protagonists, This is a fine first
film by director Terry Malick and pro-
vides a fine contrast to some of his later
work,

A Little Romance ~ (1979,1021 min.)

As its title sugesls, A Little Romance is a
modern day Romeo and Juliet story, only
this time the characters are fantasy-filled
adolescents living in France.

While their relationship has little to in-
terest moviegoers, Sir Laurence Olivier,
cast as a “dapper" French pickpocket.
does much to add character to the film.
Olivier meets the children on the street
and soon cultivates a warm friendship
with them. Indeed, it seems as if he has
much more to offer than do their grumpy
and disinterested parents

Despite Olivier, A Little Romance is a
little film with little to offer,

Purple Noon — (1960, 115 min.)

Directorrscrlptwriter Rene Clement’s
murderrthrlller Purple Noon, though not
circulated widely in the United States, has
become somewhat of a cult film abroad,
possibly because it has been said to recall
Hitchcock and to anticipate Polanski.

The script, based on a novel by Patricia
Highsmith, parallels Hitchcock in situa-
tion, theme, use of the devices of idéntlly
'transference and the surprise ending,

The story is set on a yacht and is com-
posed of frame after intimate frame
through which the unholy actors reveal
themselves. Every twitch of an eyelid tells
a small, stinging truth,

OfPurple Noon, The Times said, “Every
detail is examined by Clement’s peering
camera eye, every measure and hint. It is
literally shocking and eering with the
wickedness so plainly in view.”

One of the best of the Foreign Film
Series, this thriller should not be missed.
