YGB, Singers Tour Over Break

By Jessica Stretton

VER spring break, Grinncll
students in two different
singing ensembles com;

pleted exciting tours in Texas and
New England.

The Young Gifted and Black
GospelChoirtoured Ncmersey,Ncw
York City, and Washington, DC.
during the first week ofspring break,

Junior Brian Smith said that
though the YGB has recently been
singing morecontemporary material,
the choir tended to perform tradi-
tional gospels. S m ith alsocommented
that this has been one of the Choir’s
best years, that the Choir “has im-
provedmuchandwillhopefullyconr
tinue to improve.”

The YGB is directed by Les
Talley,aresidentofDesMoineswho
comes to Grinnell every Saturday to
work with the students,

Meanwhile, The Grinnell Sing-
ers toured Oklahoma and Texas in
nine days. The Singers performed
gospel medleys, Chinese and Rus
sian folk music, 16Ihrcentury Elizar
bethan Latinatc religious hymns,
Rachmaninoffand Mozart at various
churches and high schools.

While the Singers seemed very
happy to have been in the warm
weather, there were mixed reactions
about the tour.

Junior Singer Liz Borg-Bowman
thought that while some of the people
she met tended to be rather conserva-

tivc, she found theirdiffercnt life style
intriguing.Shcspcntoncevcning talk-
ing with her hosts about everything
from “gay~rights to segregation.”
However, senior Morgan
Robenson said that while everyone
“enjoyed the sun" he felt thataudicnce
appreciation level was not very high.
He felt that the audiences seemed to
have been expecting spirituals rather
than 16th century Church music.
Junior Bendix Anderson thought

that “sometimes the audience seemed
bored,yettheygavcusunifonnlythunr
derous applause and occasional standr
ing ovations."

The Grinnell Singers traveled
by bus, and stayed with Grinnell

Students, Faculty Perform in
Baroque Ensemble Concert

By Aida Ruilova

HAT do Serenades, musical

instruments, and William
Byrd have in common? They are part
of theexcitin g performances you can
observe at the upcoming concert ot
the Grinnell Collegium Mttst'cum
(early music ensemble) directed by
Elimbeth Hays.

This program is a tribute to the
greatElizabethancomposer,William
Byrd, whose birth 450 years ago is
beingcommemomted internationally.

Grinncll College students and
faculty members will pay their re-
spects to Byrd by playing works of
famous contemporaries and follow-
ers such as the great Henry Purcell.
The performers play replica Renaisr
sauce and Baroque instruments

which, aside from being different
from instrumean they are normally
accustomed to, are difficult to learn.
Inasinglesemester, the students
have teamed complicated pieces on
instruments such as the viola de
gamba and the shawm. Theirsuccess
in a relatively short period of time,
according to Hays, can be attributed
in part to the strong character of the
typical Grinnell College student.
The hard Work students have ex-
erted for this ensemble has been “rcr
markable,” added Hays. Most of the
studentsarcnotmusic majorstheyare
simply people who share a common
interest in this music and who have
come together to perfomi as a group.
Everyone is invited tojoin in the
celebration of Byrd’s remarkable
achievements on Sunday April 18,
1993 at 8:00 pm. in Herrick Chapel.

genuine interest in other programs.

“The overall progression of
Bharati's visits was from formal to
informal," said Smith. “As she conr
tinucd coming back, she worked into
things that were already going on at
Grinnell.Shebecamepartofthecom-
munity and really got to know the
students and faculty, instead ofbeing
this lofty, strange person appearing
in our midst."

”Really, in terms of what I did
here, reading from my fiction and
lecturing were just very small parts
of my program," said Mukherjee. “I
met with faculty, had meals with stu-
dents, met with people in town~the
Peace Institute, the Public Library,
etc. Ivisiteddifferentkindsofcourses,
too, from sociology and feminist and
gender study classes, to American
studies and writing workshop
classes.”

The future of a writer-in-resi-
deuce program at Grinncll has sevr
eml possiblities.

“A decision would have to be
made whether we wanted to have a
lesser-known writer come and teach a
course for a whole semester, or if we
wanted to get someone for a shorter
amount of time, a more highrprofile
pcrson of Mukherjee’s status, to come
forashorter period of time,like four to
sixweeksovertwoyears,“saidSmiLh.

Another possiblity for the pro
posed program includes expanding the
program to includealloftheFineArLs.

“It'sallprettyopenrightnowWe
don’t know if we want it tojust be a
writer-in-residence program or if it
should be an artist-in-residence pro-

gram that mightbring a composer to
campus one semester. a sculptor to
campus the next semester, etc. Or
maybe we should just begin with the
writing and grow,“ Smith said.

As always, before any such pro-
gramcanbeimplemented,theremust
be money, and that undoubtedly
means a lengthy wait before the
program’s initiation.

The money would more than
likely come from the big funds cam—
paign, which is scheduled to begin in
a few months in conjunction with the
college's Sesquentennial in 1996,
Smith said. Based on a recent meet
ing with President Ferguson, Smith
believes that there is interest among
theadministrationinestablishingsuch
a program.

“There were a lot of positive
signs from President Ferguson,"
Smith said. “The administration Saw
results from Mukherjee’s visits, and
is seriously considering including it
as one of the programs that would
benefit from this big campaign.”

But even if the college does not
establish a permanent writerrinvresir
dcnceorartjstrinrresidenceprogram,
Mukherjee hopes that students will
take something from her visits and,
most importantly, keep on writing.

“There is incredible self knowl-
edge here at Grinnell, and it’s mani—
fested in writing," she said, “Over
my visits, I have seen student manu-
scripts become more and more com-
plex and dense. The writing is get-
ting better and better.

”I hope that students will remem-
ber this: that literature and writing can
be a consolation throughout life, no
matter what a person pursues."
