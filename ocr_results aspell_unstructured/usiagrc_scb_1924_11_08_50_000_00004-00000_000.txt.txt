Life Is Becoming
Huge Pep Meeting

, (4mm Washington Review)

F. William Darner. business man-
agcr oi the University Hatchet. left
last Monday to accept a position as
secretary to the minister of the Amer-
icztn Legation at Managua. Nicaragua.

Dar-her. who came to George Wash-
ington University last fall after one
year at Grinnell College. Gn'nnell.
Iowa. was a member of the Sopho-
more class. In the one year he was at
George Washington his services on
the business staff were of such
character that the Student Council
last spring elected him business innu-
ager for the 1924-25 Hatchet,

Thinking for oneself was the idea
stressed by Rev. W'OLfe of the Green-
wood Congregational Church, Des
Moines, in his Y. M. talk last Thursday
night. "Lile is becoming too much
like n hose pep meeting." he said. "We ‘
must realize that there are certain‘
tundemental problems which each of
us has to decide lor himself."

Mr. Wolfe continued by explaining
his views on mass psychology. "indlan
war dances are thought by the saw‘
ages to be quite necessary to insure‘
victory in battle. Pen meetings have
an important part in the winning of
football games. But in the game of
life. the hardest struggles must be
fought by the individual, alone and
unaided." l

Mr. Darner. whose home was in
Ottumws. lived in Building Four dur~
lug his year in Grinnell. and was a
member of the class of '23.
