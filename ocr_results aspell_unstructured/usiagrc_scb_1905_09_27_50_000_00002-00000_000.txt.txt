OOTBALL games cannot he won
by the team alone. They must
he supported and encouraged by the
student body. For the ﬁrst time in
several years, Gllllllell is; to have a
series oi home games which will de-
mand the presence oi every student to
insure a successiui season. Routing
is almost as essential a part or a toot-
oall game as the play itselt and the
spirit with wliicii a team is aided
decides largely the outcome oi the
contests. The deiunct J. P. Watson
hand have talrcn steps toward a rem-v
ganization ata recent meeting and it
is now time that a I'ooLer's cluh or
some similar organi ation was being
iormed.

darcs hack to the years when inter-
collegiate athletics iici-c hrst instlr
tnted iii lnwa College. JL‘s’ member-
ship is composed oi all students who
pay the l'ct'uldl' athletic dues, llrery
student who in anynay is oonncctcd
with athletics in any departincut is
expected to rain the union.

Although most of the eaecutiye
husinessis at present carried on by
the athletic hoard or control, )eli ser-
eralimportant duties are leitto thc
unioii,sucli as sanctioning; the elec»
tion or the captains oi the various
teams and the electing oiastndent
member to the board or control. The
g'reatcst beneﬁt to be deriied irom
tlieuiiion is that tree medical aid is
tarnished to all members who are iu~
yured in any at the dilicrent sports.

The oliicers (or the present year are
Ilenry Marvin, President; Geo. Moll-
rath, v e President; A. 13. Dcliaau,
Secretary; and A. E. Wilder student
memher oi the board oi control.

All men should hunt up the secre-
tary and pay their dues immediately
and not wait to be repeatedly asked
ior them.

COLLEGE BAND ORGANIZES.
The remnants oi the John P. Wat-
son hand together with sereral re
emits from among the new students
held a meeting Monday evening to see
what coiiid he done toward edecting a
reorganization. Itwas decided that
the college needed a hand and that
work should be begun at once. The
principle trouble seemed to he the
regulation or the number or players in
each part: clarinet players were es-
pecially scarce while ntlier parts were
too well represented Altogether
ahout twenbymll‘u men were arailahie
winch assures us a competent organ
nation to represent the college. A
practice was held on Tuesday night
to get the parts in line and get under»
way the preparation or music ior the
loothall game Saturday. Nothing;
iorther inthe iiayoi organiiation was
accomplished hut the success or the
iii-st practice assures a good hand.
