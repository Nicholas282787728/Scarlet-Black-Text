as a singer of unusual ability and will
add considerable color to the program
by wearing native costumes,

Hugh “’alpolo, famous English
author, writer of the “Dark Forest,"
the ”secret city" and other novels,
will share with Sir Basil Thompson
the honor of being one of the two best
numbers on the course. Mr. Wei-
pole is at the present time taking
active part in discussions of American
literature and for this reason is in
the limelight of American attention.

His coming will undoubtedly be hall-,

ed with delight by all lovers of books
and should also be a pleasure to
others who undoubtedly will be hc~
witchcd by the plcasiiig personality
and keen wit of Mr. Walpole.

Dr. Wilfred Grenfell, explorer of
the North, will be the concluding zit-

has gained distinction iiy his personal
work done in b’cttering conditions in
the great land of Labrador. Besides
being a man who has much to tell of
interest he is also interesting him-
self and his lectures are always feu-
turcs on any platform.

will be held in Herrick Chapel.

In response 'to insistent demnds for

Rhapsody in I“ Minor by Dohnzingi,
and Segnidilie by Albeniz.

In his concert last night Mr. Gran

from showing his [nil musical bowel-s. l

His voice did not show the richness

He was very considerate in explain-

meaning of some of his songs, and he

songs with wonderful appreciation of
their meaning. It was his interpretive
ability which won for him the sympar
thy of his audience.

"Aft Night," by Serfei Rachmaninoff,
was an excellent interpretation, while
“The Journey". by Michael Glinka, a
very difficult selection to render, was
one of the most pleasing songs on
the program. Monssgorsky's “The Song
of the Flea" was made doubly inter-7

lsong. “Lectle Bate/856",

with a musical setting by ccoffrey

‘and the defense is tightening up con—

in the line-up. With the Pioneers
functioning as efficiently this after-

liould be able to take the St, Louis

dopcstei-s that they will hit their stridu
today and should begin their winning
