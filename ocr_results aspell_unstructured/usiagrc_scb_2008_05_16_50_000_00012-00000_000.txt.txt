the Grinncll community and eased fears
about Grinnell that had developed in her
first few weeks here and during her prospie
experience, which she "really didn't like."

“I think a lot orpeopie coming here rvho
are Christian are nervous because ot‘jusr the
way that Grinnell presents itself.” said Alto.
“Like we're all atheists, or we hate God, or
whatever. Somehow the impressions given

Amongst the diapers and dildos,
a dude strolled through the ciraos
clad only in dining hall apron,
sirocs, a hat
and gloves. The

and saucy, this
snrrienr's behind
was slapped
more times than
a raw ehiclecn breast on a hot sumr

and it was irot.

prior to Grinneii in the often critr

Jersey,

by Morgan Horton 3

After moving to Grinneil,
Gates soon came to ﬁnd hrs {a
vorirc part about life at Grinnell
to he people—good, great people
But for every best, there is a worst
Grinnellians were Gates least far

vor‘itc part
r of Grinnell
‘1 as well. In
an environ-
ment where
the outspo-
ken are often
celebrated,
Gates found himseitlearnrng that
Grinneilrans sometimes tail to be
realistic.

Now a senior, Gates is ﬁtting
the very real truth that his {our
years at Grinncll arc leaching their
conclusion He Will spend his lir
nal weeks enjoying Grinnell for its

Nate Gates .

r

Simplicities, Among these Gates
recognizes “walking tirrough
camprrs seeing Grinnellians doing
Grinnellian things" to be ofcliief
importance,

Tire final weeks also offer
Gates the opportunity to sir back
and enjoy the best part about be-
rng a senior—senioritis. “Before
your senior year you don't think
you care. Then when you get to
your senror year, you really clon't
care but you do what you have to
elo because you know how."

Gates believes he is finally
equrppeu with all the tools he
neecls to go out and race the world
outside or oui belovetl bubble.
Gates plans on spending his sunr
rner working at Lonnsicis. After
that he nnght look for a job at an
an gallery but admits that when

it comes to his future, he has “as
Little ofnn idea as [he] had com-
ing into cr-rnnell."

Though his future is yet to
be determined Gates knows one
thing for ccrlamiiflie couloi have
any superpower ire would want to
be able to read minds. Among the
more obvious rersnns why this
power is far superior to any other-
Gates reasons that being able to
read minds would allow him lo
“get what [he] wants without the
guess work."

In the end, one d esn't need
special super power to know
that Nate Gates has left his mark
on Grinncli College for years to
come.

After all what's not to love
about a bale asset] student in a
dining hall apron?
