Advocates of popular
and woman suﬂel'age should rejoice
over the opportunites given to exercise
these “great and inalienable rights".
With 3. semester lee question and an
alumnisenior pin question to be vot-
ed on everyone hasa chance to express
his opinions in black and white and in
causes which are at once important
and demanding or attention. There
is no property, sex or age qualiﬁcation
in connection with this vote casting,
so all should feel satisﬁed enough to
take advantage of the occasion.

Let us say a word here in regard to
“OpinionCards”. It’s an old subject by
now or course, in tnlsday of hurry and
change, butsomething is going to he
done some day about the matter oi a
semester fee. Its the advanced and
modern method of avoidingdill‘louities
hitherto unsurmountable and now is
the time to get in your word in regard
to it. Cards are still to be had at the
President’s olllou or the association
rooms and the SCARLET and BLACK
box in the former place is ready to re-
ceive many and all expressions, This
is in a way a vote and it is desired
that as many as possible express their
views one way or the other.

"Yr 1” 4,
The Glee Club Songs.

Asnle from any muslcal value which
iowa CollegeGlee club music mayniuve
there is a further quality which is
fully as important. This quailty be-
longs to it only at Grinnell and hes
come to it through tlieyedrs of use-acid
blou which it has had with College life
here. Tile 01d familiar S’Jnlzs are not
college songs strictly, much less Grill-
nellsongs but when they lime been
sung so often and so well by our own
people they have come to rake oua
special meaning lor Iowa College stu-
dents which does not attend them
elsewhere. Many of them have no
other quality than this to make them
permanent in the minds and hearts or
students. Some are little more than
transient bills DI rag time but there’s
something in them which makes a
manor woman forget their musical
insigniiicance and regard them as
special Grinnell property. From
“Sweetheart” to the chair drill they
all belong to us and every repetition
of them by the Glee Club only add to
this lasting quality

The Dointhas been renamed in the
matter or the alumni pin where a
ﬁnal and decisil'e action must be
taken. It is geneially admitted that
such an emblem will mean much to
the college, both students and alumni.
the only dimculiy being that ex»
perienced in reaching an agreement
asto the delinite form this emblem
shall take. An opportunity is now
given for every individual as such to
express an opinion and no dilliculty
should be experienced in arriving at
same conclusion as to the wishes of
the student body. The trouble lies
only in the neglect shown by those
who should be most interested. An
expression of preference is desired
irorn each and every student of the
four classes. This is not a diilioulh
task thrust upon us. so let everyone
make it a point to Visit the library
and choose the design Which seems
best to ﬁll the need. Only a few
minutes are required Locust a ballot
and the results of this little eIIort ex-
panded by everyone will he the means

of united action by the student body
in a question which concerns all and
Which will add much to Grinnell’s re-
putation ler doing things and doing

them right.

«in R.\\i.cleeri
In a close and very exciting contest
the Des Moines Y. M. C. A. on their
home ﬂoor defeated the Grinnell
team by a score of 3—1 M) 33. The
game was last and furious through-
out and was marred by rough play on
bath sides 13. fouls being called on the
Y. M. C. A. and 16 On Grinnell. The
game abounded in sensational baskets
from the centre of the ﬁeld, the Y. M,
C. A. being especially fortunate in
this respect. Fisher started the
scoring by a basket over half the
length of the ﬁeld and then for a
time the game seemed to be a walk-
aivay for Des Moines the ﬁrst half
ending 21 to 15 in their favor. How-
ever as usual Grinnell came back
strong in the last half gradually pull-
ingup until time put a stop to the
contestlusba moment toosoon. Every
