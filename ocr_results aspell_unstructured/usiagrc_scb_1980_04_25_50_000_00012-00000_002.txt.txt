The Grinnell College men's and
women’s combined AIAW»M (Division
III) beer drinking team won the 40th
and final spot in the NCAA champion-
ship tournament to be held in Pitts-
burgh, Pa, on June 14th,

The event is in its 15th season of ex-
istence, and the Pioneers will be try-
ing to tie-throne il-time champs the
University of Wisconsin at Madison.

Pioneer captain Bud Miller says
that he feels the Scarlet and Black
have a good chance to place in the
final four of the event. “We practice in
the Pub every evening from 4-6:30
p.m., and we have the team spirit to
carry us through. I think we can do
it! "

. The beam has had to overcome
many difficulties to get to the point
where they are now. The first such
obstacle was the dispute over which
type of beer the team would practice
with.

came time for the big meets they’d be
in shape," said Bum “Coach" Olym-
pla,

But many on the 12-member team
felt that it they practiced with a live
beer they would be in better condition
at the end of the season when it got
closer to tournament time. “The wear
and tear on your body in a sport like
this is amazing," one player com»
merited.

The other obstacle that the team
had to iace was the problem of
scheduling meets and linding op-
ponents. Grinnell is the only Midwest
Conference school left to have a beer
drinking team, Coe and Carleton
withdrew their teams early in the
season {or what was termed “bladder
problems.” ,

The Pioneers have had four matches
this season and are undefeated. They
have notched victories over Carleton,

(Roberts U.) were real whimps,” said
all-star chugger Busch “Buhba”
Schlitz, “none of them were leit stand-
ing after the fifth keg, hell, (burp)

we were just getting started."

The chuggers say that they will
warm-up for the NCAA tourney the
way that they always do. “The Grin-
nell Relays are the best warm-up a
team could have,” commented Miller.

The team will be selling beer at the
Pioneer baseball games this season to
get money so that they can buy new
t-shirts. “The new ones are going to
say ‘Grinnell‘ on me front, and ‘the
new beer capital of the U.S.' on the
back," Miller said.
