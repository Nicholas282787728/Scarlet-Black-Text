0 Why Stay In College?

While the Anny, Navy, and Marines are
training the young men of today for the
purposes of defense, many students are ask-
ing, “Why stay ill college?” They argue that
at a time like this further study is futile.

Ill a sense they are right. If we lose this
war, all American ideals and traditions will
be of no help. But there is one thing that
can be taught ill college which will help
immeasurably. After the war men will be
needed, lots of men, They are the ones who
will rebuild this world, help to put foreign
affairs on a better basis.

The University of Maryland has started
just such a course, training students for
foreign administration posts ill the post-war
world. They argue ”in view of tlle major
role this nation will undoubtedly play ill

Olcl Track Star—

world affairs after the war, we must train
men for the job."

This course will correlate the study of
languages, government, military history,
social customs, etc. of the leading nations
of Europe and the Orient. It will be the
first department of its kind ill all American
university

Grillllell obviously could not attempt to
maintain such a comprehensive program,
but study of that type will be of supreme
importance after the war. Students who are
well-qualified for such specialized training
would do well to think carefully before
hurrying out to enlist

O Soliloquy by a Sad Senior.

Friday was May first. Ill less than one
month from that'day the class of ’42 will
be no more than a memory. This is a sober-
ing thought.

Graduation day this year will bring more
than its share of pathos, Farewells will be
more difficult than in previous years. For
there will be an atmosphere of permanence
about them that will clutch at the heart. A
smiling good-by, a hearty llondclasp, and
then a second-glance at college cllums as
they disappear into the unknown.

Nevertheless, almost thirty days and
nights remain as a respite before the pre—
sentation of Sheep-skills, Pleasant da,‘
spent on a sun—lit campus, balmy nights
spent in leisurely Wanderings where ”the
leaves cast phantom shadows as the llTOOU‘
light Sifts hetween”—these are the mem-
ories that we want to carry away from
Grinnelli

To the class of ’42, this merry month of
May will be the most significant month of
their college life. It will be a month of
happy experiences. Lets drain it to the
dregs.

Jay Smith, 70

—Here Saturday

Probably the oldest Grinnell track
star to attend the track meet
Saturday was 70 year old Jay
Smith, of Clarion. whose college
record of 5 3-5 seconds for the
50 yard dash Stood unbroken for
mcny years.

Smith, who graduated in 1395,
called Roy Cochran the greatest
hurdler he had ever seen. and de-
scribed the entire track meet as
“first rate.”

Besides the 50 yard dash, he
also ran the 330 and 100 yard
dashes and played on the football
team while in college,

Following his graduation from
Crinncll, Mr. Smith studied law at
Iowa State college at Ames._He
practiced law for several years
but later went into the printing
business.

bellow classmates of Mr. Smith
here were Dr. Paul E. Somers
and Professor Emciitus Garrett
P, Wyckoff.
