The surprise of the meet was the
strong showing of the Rawson hall

second honors. Her representatives
won two firsts and tied for first in
two other instances. Langan failed to
show her expected strength in the
iield events and could do no hetter
than fourth. Langnn ruled as a tav-
orite at the start of the meet. Gates
finished only one point hehind Lan-

Each year the men and the women
in the journalism department at Ore-
gon vie with each other in putting
out the best edition. The faculty
judges the work on general appear-
ance and management, and the wine
ncrs entertain the losers.

Newton D. Baker was nominated
president and Franklin D. Roosevelt
vice president hy the model Deino-
cratic convention at Rochester uni»
versity last week. in the first ballots
logs the two candidates received an
almost equal number of votes, but
after the eighth ballot Baker ,
strength became evident.

Prof. Horace Williams of the Un _
versity of North Carolina has given
but two A’s on his course, logic and
civilization, during his 42 years of
teaching. “The A student," he ex-
plained, "is the master of the course,
one who has been stimulated to re-
turn to philosophy more than it yields
ed him." On the other hand a B
student is one who possesses an ac-
curate knowledge of the course, hut
as Professor Williams expresses it,
is uninspired."
