No STATEMENT GIVEN OUTV

Students , College, and
Bookstore Funds Said ;
To Be Involved. |

College and town alike received a
ﬁnancial blow this morning when the
doors of the Merchants' National Bank
were closed by order of Lhe Board of
Directors, and the affairs of the in.
stitution placed in charge of National
Bank Examiner, N. E. Hansen.

At least half, probably a majority of
the student accounts in Crinnell banks
were placed with the Merchants Na—
tional. The College Bookstore funds
are involved, and also a portion of the
administration funds of the college.

The officers of the bank, George
Hamlin, president, B. l. Carney, vice-
president, and John 'I-lorn, cashier,
have made no statement to the pub-'
lic, at the time the Scarlet and Black
goes to press. Rumors are plentiful,
of course, and a certain amount of
authenticity seems to hover over the
report that the bank examiner found
a deficit, and the reserve fund in bad
shape, some time ago; that he gave
the stockholders ninety days to make
up' the deficit; that they tried to

, force a so per cent assessment on the
stock, which two of the stockholders
protested; and tht the directors fin-
ally voluntarily turned the books over
in the national bank examiner.

It is generally expected that the
bank which was capitalized at $103,‘
000, Will in the long run pay all its
depositors, though it Will take time
to cash in on iarm holdings and farm .
mortgages Mindy people predict that ‘
_a complete change in organization will
take place Within the next few days
and that the institution will not open
again its the "Merchants National."

Student devotees of the thi'CC ma-
i‘or political Dailies, who have been
consiguing each oiher to everlasting
fire in their campaigning cf the past
few weeks, had an opportunity to mcct
on common ground and tlikc stock of
the results of their rcports in the
straw vote which the Scarkt and
Black held in the A. n. it. reading
room last Thursday. The dope was
completely upset when Coolidge and
steck were found to lead, and
Follette and hrookhart to bring up
the rear in the rather oners'ded bal—
toting.

The reading room rivaled the police
Gazette in its artistic decoration; and
ambitious amateurs who scratched
their X's for the first time were prop-
erly impressed by the bland and him
ant couutenances of

their compatriots. Portraits of Mr.

Last Wednesday night the Oxford

17 Varsity debaters were defeated by

, urinneii in what was universally ac.

claimed the most interesting and novel

debate ever held on the Grinnell camr‘

pus. A rising vote on the
proposition, "Resolved: That This
House is Opposed to the
Principle of Phobibition,” taken before
the debate began, resulted in ($34 bol
lots for the negative, (:2 for the ar-
firmative and one undecided.
Following the debate, the audience
was pollcd again, to ascertain what

change of opinion had taken place

during the course DI the Ell'fs'ulrients.‘
On this ballot, the negative sccurad‘

630 Votes, the affirmative 52, while
the number at “fence riders" leaped
to 17.

The debate was characterized by
many quotations, serious or otherwisc,

by a great number at clever piedsdnt-,

lies, and by considerable display of

the cicments of good public spenkxng.i

Famous Tlritlsli Economist to Spelt]:
at Long Chapel Next Tuesday.

At long chapel Tuesday morning,
iWalter Thomas Layton, the famous
‘English economist and editor of the
London Economist, wil speak on
“Britain's Economic Future.“

Mr. Layton was formerly a member
of the Munitions Councii,'and in 1517
represented the Ministry of Munitions
in the Balfour Mission to the United
states, At the present time, he is Di-
r-ectoi of the Ecclnomic and Financial
section of the League of Nations, as
well as Director at the National Fed-
eration of iron and Steel Manufactu -
61 Although he has written var us
articles in reviews and journals, his
books, “An introduction to the study
of Prices" and “Relations of Capital
and Labour" stand out preeminentiy in
theccouurnic world.

ir. Layton is to be one of the leer
tuleis at the meeting of the New York
iAcademy of Political Science in New
Yul-ii City during the mouth of Novemr
her, and Grimiell is very fortunate in
securing his presence.

The subject, "Britain's Economic
Future," is one of almost as much con-
cern to us as it is to the Euglish'thcm-
‘selres and those nmjo rug in econom-
ics or business administration should
be especrtilly interested in the address.

DUE IN FIVE YEAHS

‘100-Yard Run For Touchdown by “Hap" Moran
In First Minute of Play Determines
* Score of Brilliant Game

(special to Smile: it Blitck)

A sensational 100 yard run after the
opening kickoff, followed by brilliant
playing tointbe rest of the game, won
Crinneil a 6—0 victory from Coeitbe
first Ploneer Win over the Cedar
thids institution in ﬁve years. The
Scarlet and Black team really out
played thetKolliLWlx'S in the ﬁrst half
willie the ﬁnal periods were played
on even terms. ,

Coach Eby s warriors taught Val~
lantly for a score in the ﬁnal moments
of play, but the Pioneer line Proved a
veritable stone wall, and twice stopped
almost cermin touchdowns within the
ten yard line.

Moran and Sweet were the outsmnd<
ing Stars in the backﬁeld, while Hal.»
worth and Peterson played exception»
ally good games in the forward wall.

The Pioneers got away to a flying
start when Coe kicked off and "Han"
diet-an received . the hall underneath
his own goal post and ran loo yards
through the whole Coe team for a
touchdown. Meeter’s trial attempt
for point by drop kicking Was block-
ed, and the score was s to o in favor
of Grinnell less than a minute after
the game had started. Coe kicked
off again and although that Pioneers
carried the ball past Cue’s 40 yard
line three times they lacked the punch
to carry it within scoring distance for
the rest of the quarter.

At the start or the second period
Kingeiy went in for Meeter. Moran
was forced to kick and Coe tailed to
gain an inch, but Rinefort, big left
tackle, was injured and had to be
replaced by Howarth. Punts were
exchanged several times but neither
team could gain, and with Grim-tell
in possession of the ball on the 15 yard
line, Johnson was sent in for Siotts
to relieve Moi-an in the puntiug. Coe
received Johnson's punt on Crinnell's
30 yard line, and as three passes tail-
ed, Smith attempted a place kick
which failed to score. The Pioneers
werc forced to punt again and Smith
triCl another place kick from the 50
yard line, but the ick [on short. The
half cndcd l Grilulell in posses 'on
of the ball on their own 25 yard line
