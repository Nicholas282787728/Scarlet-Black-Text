Some Like ,It Hot

by Susan Bauer

The situation oi men dressing up like
women has appeared many times in films.
Dustin Hoffman cross-dressed in
"Tootsie," playing an actor who pretended
to be a woman when he needed to earn a
living. In "Some Like It Hot.” a 1959 black-
andrwhite film noted as a benchmark in
iilm comedy. two men must dress as
women not to earn a living, but to keep
their lives. The two friends, played by
Tony. curtis and Jack. Lemmon,
adv‘erte‘ntiy 'witness' the 'St, Valentine’s
Day Massacre in Chicago. They need to
escape the gangsters, but do not have
enough money to leave town.

The pair nee Chicago disguised as
members oi an all-iemale music group
which is headed for Miami by train,
Marilyn Monroe is Sugar. one oi the group
members. Curtis decides to pursue her and
pretends to be a millionaire boat—owner as
a means to this end, As the supposed boat
owner, he needs, oi course, a boat to imr
press Monroe. He does find one, but the
real owner (Joe E. Brown) falls for the
iemaieattired Lemmon. As you can imr
agine, the situation of two men dressed
like women has multiple comedic effects

in-V

in “Some Like It Hot.”

Director-writer Billy Wilder and his cos
scenarist I.A.L. Diamond did an excellent
job of combining cinematic techniques
with the ideas, the performances, and the
various actions of the characters. Lem~
man and Curtis are hilarious, affecting
high, pinched voices and exaggerated
iemale mannerisms. Monroe, though not
always consistent in her acting skills, has
a role in this film that conceals her
weaknesses and displays her strengths.

The film is iast-moving, and although
somge critics felt that the film stretches the
central idea, closet critics of Grinnell had
favorable comments for "Some Like It
Hot.” A North Campus female said, ”It
was a iuuun movie," an unidentified
sophomore said that “Lemmon and Curtis
are really cute," and an oftcampus male
said simply, “It was a cool movie.”

I recommend ”Some Like It Hot" as a
good way to spend 122 minutes of your
weekend "Isprobablyashould-be-studyingr

not to overlook the irightening potential oi
disgruntled younger siblings, H is Robert

Betty Davis as the horribly aged and
psychotic Baby Jane wlio wreaks havoc
upon the nerves and person oi her crippled
older sister. played by Joan Crawtord.

Baby Jane clings to memories or her
halcyon childhood when she was lhe “best
child star in vaudeville.” Dressed in faded,
oversized children's dresses, her face cak-
ed with makeup and rouge to conceal the
wrinkles, and her hair curled into Shirley
Temple ringlets. Baby Jane Waltzes
around the house singing her old routines.
Her hatred of her sister stems from the
success of her sister's adult career, while
the demand for Baby Jane vanished when
she reached puberty, her sister became a
distinguished film actress during
Hollywood’s heyday.

In a flashback, Baby Jane is shown drive
ing the car which hit her sister and crippl-

Davis gives a tour-de-force performance
or quintessential high ciiiap, Crawford is
also superb. playing her role or St. Joan in
classic martyi'rllke style; lier perior-
mance is especially ironic in light oi her
daughter's tell-all book ,and Faye
Dunaway's portrayal of her in “Mommie

more often unintentionally humorous film.
Expect nothing more irom this trim and
you will not be disappointed.

by Kevin O'Prey
“Lenny," a 1974 film directed by Bob

Fosse, attempts to understand the life and .

art of one of America’s most controverSial
comedians, Lenny Bruce Bruce, perhaps
the epitome ol the counterculture hero.

and nihilistic stage show, His life,
however, was an exaggerated version oi
his art; he was frequently harassed by the
police because at his use oi narcotics. ar-
rested on obscenity charges. and was mar-
ried to Honey, a nightclub stripper

On stage nothing was taboo or sacred
from his scabrous sense of irony and
humor He once made fun of Jackie Ken»
nedy attempting to climb out oi the
presidential lime in Dallas. He found a sick
pleasure in directly attacking the
members of his audience with racial slurs
like “‘kike," "nigger," and ”Epic.”
Through it all, however, Lenny Bruce
developed a notoriety oi cult proportions

performer in the Sordid world of show
busmess.

Thus. Fosse brings to "Lenny" the in»
sight and experience that make the film an
honest attempt to explain a complex in-
dividual. The film is shot in a blackaand~
white, documentary style that alternates
between Bruce's stage periormances and
his real life (although the distinction is not

is depicted as a misunderstood tigure who
is a symbol of his times. and his racism
and hatred are the products M a troubled
era, His life imitates his art until it even-
tually devours him in a tragic death.
