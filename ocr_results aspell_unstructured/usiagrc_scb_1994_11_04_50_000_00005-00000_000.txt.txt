than pork barreling for derense con—

environment in Iowa.

Baxter, who is supported by the
National Education Association,
hopes to stopa contract sponsored by
the Republican leadership lhatprom-

spending on higher education loan

important issue for Baxter because

Wl—IENGcorgeBushwasoustwlrom
the White House in l992, many
people thought that the neoreonscr—
vative “Reagan Revolution” was
over. Those people can’t be pleased
with what they are seeing in Gover—
nor Terry Branslad’s campaign.
Branstad, who has served as
Govemor for twelve years, is once
again on the ballot And, if you've
seen any of his ads on television this
fall, it should be fairly obvious that he
took office in the
midst of the
Reagan-B ush
dynasty.
The ad that
has run every
five minutes
each night dur-
ing the six
o‘clock news
features a com
parison of the
c a it d id ate 5 '
vicwsonlawen-
f 0 re e m e n t .
Branstad claims

that his oppo-
nent, Bonnie

Campbell, is "soft" on crime. His
primary reason for claiming this is
that Campbell is not in favor of re-
establishingthe death pcnalty,which
he claims is the primary tool in stop»
ping crime.

Unless the vast majority of
crimeseommitted in thestate of Iowa
are murders (which isn't the case), it
cannot be the case that the death
penalty is an effective way to deal
with crime. Even ifwe only consider
the effects of the death penalty on
deterring murders, it is questionable
as to whether or not the effects are
positive; mosc states that execute the
most murderers are also suites that
havesomeofthehighestmurderrates,
such its Texas and Florida,

He goes on to boast of having
twice as many prisoners in Iowa pris»
ons us when he took office. Presum-
ably, the vast majority of diese new
prisonersaren’tsimplycrimitlalswho
wouldn’t have served their sentences
bet 0 Branstad took office. instead.
iheyarepcoplewhoweren’tcommit—
ting crimes before Branstad took of-
fice. If you happen to be one of the
twice as many victims of crime that
live iii the state thatBranstad is mak»
ing "safe“ by increasing the number
of prisoners, you would probably be
hesitant to declare Eranstad's suc-

cs increasing prison populations
t. Jietory for the residents of iowa.

Bratistad then goes en to want of
Campbell's willingness to grant pa-
role to first-time prisonersl If
Branstadrefuses to believe that crimie
nals can be rehabilitated, why has he
given special permission for some
released felons to carry guns?

Like Bush, Branstad has also
eamod the endorsement of the ultra-
conservative Christian Coalition,
which was founded by Pat Robertson
(“,.,Christ is the head of the house/4
hold, and the husband is the head of

the wife and that‘s
justthewayit'ts").
The group has
printed up “voter
guides” for distri-
bution in Iowa
churches that criti-
cize Campbell for.
amongst other
things, supporting
“taxpayer funding
of abortions,”
“special rights for
homosexuals" and
“increased propv
my taxes."

Campbell denies

the allegations,
claiming only to enforce the current
Iowa civil rights legislation and na-
tional nilings on abortions. The guide
prompted her to tell the Des Maine:
Register, “My pastor was quite sur~
prised to realize that God has a posi-
tion on state property taxes, gun cone
trol,and repeal ofright—to-work laws.
But who am I to argue?"

An ad run against the Christian
Coalition lnTuesday'sRegirierasked
the question, “The leaders of the Re-
ligiousRightcontend thatthey repre,
sent the only true voice of American
Christianity Do you really wantto
let them speak for you?” Groups
such as the Christian Coalition and
Operation Rescue (whose leader,
Randall Terry, has been quoted as
saying, “I want you to let a wave of
hatred wash over you yes, hate is
good") have endorsed Teﬁy Branstztd
and other similar nee—conservative
candidates. Even though Bonnie
Campbell is a fine, qualified candi-
date for Governor, we cannot simply
claim that our reasoning behind en»
dorsing her is solely that her qualifir
cations are very good. We simply
have tobcresponsibleenough tokecp
dangerous groups like the Christian
Coalition and their pet politicians,
such as Terry Branstad, out of our
government.
