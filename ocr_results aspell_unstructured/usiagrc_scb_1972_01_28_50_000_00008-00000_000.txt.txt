The Scarlet and Black

Swimmers Take 4th In Relays

The Pioneer swim team extended
its Win streak in dual meet competi-
tion to sixteen last Friday, downing
Wayne State of Nebraska, but were
unable to repeat their success in the
Grinnell Relays the next day. The
aqua—jocks finished 4th in a seven-
team field behind Rockford, Wayne
State and Auguslana. Conference
teams Cornell, Coe ’nnd Monmouth
trailed by fairly large margins,

In the Friday meet, records for the
new complex pool fell last and tur-
iously as Grinnell swimmers set
seven new marks in winning eight oi
the thirteen events, The final score
was Grinnell 65, Wayne State 48.

Particularly impressive was
freshman Tom Rowat who set pool
records of 215.0 in the 200 yard in~

dividual medley and 2:223 in the 200'

butterfly. Other Grinnell record set-
ters were Steve Ward in the same-
style, Mike Daley in the sod free-
style, Bob Winters in the 200 back-
stroke, Mark Williams in the 200
breaststroke and Peter Bernstein in
three-meter divmg.

* Saturday’s Grinnell Relays quickly
developed into a toursteani battle
with the lead shifting between Rock-
tord, Auguslana, Wayne State, and
Grinnell. First place was in doubt
until the next to last event and the
last three places were determined by

and a boa constrictor looking after
them.

Strong performances were also ~ “)0
turned in by Rowat, Winters, and

Daley, but they couldn’t quite turn

back the challenges oi the other line

swimmers in the meet.

Tonight the Pioneers lace a big
challenge at Ripon, where last year‘s
coniei-ence champs also host Beloit
and Lawrence in a quadrangular
dual meet. Ripon has several of its
top men back and this meet should
be a pretty good indicator of where
the cohterence title will end up at

the loop meet in March.

“55195 V5' men‘s Chuck Patterson bl Crinnell hooks one against

the last event, the 400 yard freestyle

,relay, Unfortunately the best that
Coach Obermiller's charges could
do was a third place finish behind
Wayne State and Augustana to finish
to urth in the meet,

(irinnell’s only official winners
we‘re Steve Ward and Jim Carns in
the. 50 yard lreestyle relay, setting
a meet record of 47.5 with Ward
clocking 23.4. Freshman Pete Bern—
stein put on quite an aerial display
oil the high board, easily outclassing
the small field Unfortunately for
Pete and the Pioneers, the event did
not count in the imai standings. But
one cannot complain too much, for it
would have been difficult to hold the
ewent in the old swimming pool where
the ceiling isn’t even three meters
high!

The pioneers lost the edge they
had Friday with times generally
slower in the Relays. With a tough
meet less than 24 hours behind them,
that little extra amount of energy
might have been enough to make a big
difference in the standings. Even the
presence ot Daley's pet boa Con—
strictor Wasn’t enough to revive
them. I wonder how many other swim
teams have both a big Buddha statue

Out OI Shape?

Intramural basketball swung into
action last Week with a lull schedule
at hall league games and the start
or those oh.so-great interest group
teams. With so low games played, the
only thing clear is the terrible physi-
cal condition of the Crime“ student
body-and the players are presum-
ably the more athletic members or
the student body. Last weeks games
were marked by cries oi ”Help, rm
dying! Someone come in for me,”
and slowdown offenses in the Second
halves.

Younkers appears to be dominating
the IM basketball league much the
same way as they steamrollered the
other IM football teams. Dennis
Moss of Younkers leads all Scorers
with a 25-1/2 point average with no
one else averaging over 16 points.
In their game against Cleveland-
Miri, admittedly not a powerhouse
team, Younkers nonetheless scored
an impressive 94 points.

Read also appears strong, winning
by scores at 50le and 5144 against
Cleveland-Main and OiisCampus
respectively. It any team has a
chance to beat Younkers, it will be
the tall Read team.

ACM ltule Change

Several important changes in
league rules were made at the Dec—
ember meeting of the Midwestern
Conference. Conference schools
will now be required to play only
eight conference football games with
a ninth game optional, In basketball,
the conference schedule was re-
duced from 18 games to 14 games.
Eight nonscoltlerence basketball
games will be permitted, Both of
these changes go into ettcct next
year.

Defeat Mutmen

The determined but inexperienced
Grinnell wrestlers succumbed to the
fighting men at Simpson College last
Wednesday. Plagued by their rela»
live youth and three forfeits, the
fighting Grinnellians lost every sin»
gle match. When the final scorewas
tallied, Grinnell stood at the short
end-41676, our lone points coming
on a forfeit.

For a more positive view of the
match, (if one can possibly have a
positive view of that debacle) some
of the Grihnell wrestlers gave out
standing individual performances.
Dave Rice started the festivities with
an exhibition match because Simpson
forfeited his weight division. Al-
though he battled courageously, he
was pinned in the final seconds of
the match, Rick Nightingale, wreslr
ling at the lib pound division, was
outpointed by a very skillful Simpson
man. After a forfeit at 126, Lance
lsen represented Grinnell at 134

pounds, The second period brought
the end to Lance's brief match; he
was pinned by a powerful Simpson
hattler. Then came Jack Couch‘s
match at 159 pounds. Truly, Jack
commanded the match and really
should have won, Only the referee’s
debatable call of a nearspin near the
end of the match kept Jack from vics
lory. Bob Donelan, at158 pound divir
sion fought assiduously, but was out-
pointed. Then both John Pursell and
Lee Gleysteen were pinned by Simp-
son wrestlers.

The next three home meets are on
Tuesday against Cornell, next Pris
day against Duhuque, and the day
after against Cue. Let’s come out
and cheer the Grinnell matmen to
victory»or at least a good showing.

Patterson
Hooks One

Cornell last Saturday night in Mt. Vernon, De-
spite his team—leading 13 points, the pioneers

dropped the contest and tell to 2.2 on the season

Cornell Pounds BB Team

The Grihnell College cage team met
with calamity at Mt. Vernon last
Saturday night, sultering a 7944
thrashing at the hands of Cornell.
From Coach Ray Boyd’s point of view
the game “was a nightmare..,by tar
their worst perlormance ot the sea-
son.”

The Pioneers kept the game under
contention throughout the first half,
and trailed by only 9, 3243, at halfr
time. But, during the final half of
play, Cornell coupled a vigorous ol-
fensive attack with domination of the
boards to render the matchrup a
rout.

Boyd lamented the team's inability
to Compete last week, commenting:
“We Couldn’t do anything,,,we hit
only 24 per cent from the field, were
outrebounded 73439, and turned the
ball over Zl times.” Grinnell’s out—
put, however, was handicapped by the
fact that two top players, Bob Bur-
nett and Greg Bomblnski, were se-
verely limited in their activities by
illness. Large Robert, a leading cons
ference scorer who entered the game
with a l7.B point perrgame scoring
average, suffered from bronchitis,
while Bomber, infected with flue,
engaged in only partial periods of
play during the tirst half. Chuck pats
lerson alone was able to hit in dour
hle figures for the Pioneers, collect-
ing a total of IS points,

The hoopsters now embark on a
tough road series, meeting Mon-
mouth and Knox in Illinois this week
end. At Monmouth tonight, Grinnell
will attempt to avenge a 73759 den
{eat inflicted at Darby Gymnasium
last December. They will meet with

still opposition, however, tor Mons
mouth boasts a 6-1 record and the
leading conterence scorer in the
person of Mark Sager. The contest
with Knox the tollowing evening
should prove to be a more even»
handed match, for the Pioneers fin-
ished only 8 points in arrears ofthe ‘
Siwasners in their previous meeting .
at Darby. Best of health and luck!
