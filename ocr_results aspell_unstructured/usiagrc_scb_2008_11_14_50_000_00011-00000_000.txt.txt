Kate Gluckman dishes out tips, assists, and pointers

New women’s head basketball coach brings winning attitude from the shores of Massachusetts to the prarie of Grinnell

BVMANDOMONTAND

After two successful seasons as an as-
sistant coach at Tufts University, Kate
Gllickmaii has made the transition to the
cornfields of Iowa, taking over as the new
women's head basketball coach. “ She has
high expectations," said Jessica vaveika ’11.
“But they're attainable."

Gluckman brings with her a new coach-
ing philosophy from Tufts University, where
she played basketball throughout college
and coached aftei a two—
year coaching stint at
small high schools in the
norrheasr,“1 found my
selfwritiiig practice plans
while I was supposed to be
doing marketing,” Cluck-
man said on her high
school basketball coach-
ing and sports marketing
internship in Cape Cod
right after her graduation
form Tufts University. “ I
decided that my next year
out that I would continue doing that."

That next year, Gluckman moved up
to Maine and staited coaching at a private
high school toi a year before she obtained
a graduate assistant coaching position that
opened up arTufrs University, working with
her former college basketball coach, Carla
Berube.

Gluckman made the transition to as
sistant coaching fast, getting to know the
players and listening to their concerns. “Oiir
head coach could be a little difﬁcult to trilk
to sometimes,” said Tufts basketball player
Katie Tausanovitch ’09, of Bcrubei “[Katc]
was a good bridge between the players and
the coach since Kate was always so ape
proachable,"

Her approach has followed her to
Grinnell, as players enjoy how easy she is to
communicate with. “She doesn't put criti-
cisms in a rude or negative way," said Vavcrr
ka. “Its always constructive."

”Our season ii like a farm, we
need in work hard on a daily basis 50
that when we start playing games,
the (ulIil/aling slam and our pro
gram potential is achieved.”

According to Taiisanovitch, Gluckman
tried liei best to understand the playeis’ pets
sonal lives and walked to cieate a commit»
nity within the team. “I know this sounds
sort ofdorlty,"Tausanovirch said.

"But at the beginning of the season, she
once had us write on a giant sheet of paper
what oui goals were for the year and how we
were going to achieve them. As doiky as it
sounds, it worked.”

Gluckman’s team bonding worked.
The two years that
Gluckman was an
assistant coach at
Tufts the team had
phenomenal seas
sons, going 18-8 in
2006-2007 and 26-4
last year.

Before Gluck»
man arrived the
Pioneers had less
success, going 9—14
each of the past two
seasons. But this
season, Gluckman has already used her team
bonding strengths with a farming metaphor.
“ Our season is like a farm,” Gluckman said.
“We need to work hard on a daily basis so
that when we start playing games, the cul-
tivating starts and our program potential is
achieved.”

In order to stiess her point, Gluckman
took all the basketball players to farm to
see first hand the hard work farmers put in.
“Farmers are the mosr diligent workers we
know,” said Jodi Watkins '09, “They can't
take a day off, if you don’t work hard you
won't get results.”

Practices now, according to Watkins are
srructured with a speciﬁc goal in mind, and
she already notices a change in the team, “ 1
haven’t had team iinity like this for the past
three yeais.” Watkins said.

Gluckman and the Pioneers open up the
season this Saturday at 3 pm. against Mare
tin Luti-ier at Darby Gymnasium.

Knights of St. Noi-bci-r was signiﬁr
cant because no current member
of Glinncll's lostel had ever
defeated the Gieen Knights.
The team look-ed to carry this
feeling into the championship game against
Carroll College. a tcain thar had beaten
Gtinltcll 370 just three weeks earlier in the
regular season.

”We weie a lot more olgaltized and much
less intimated” of Carroll after beating St.

Norbert, Rosenberg said. This confidence,
however, did not materialize into a champi-
onship win.
Carioll jumped out to an early 3,0
lead within the first 22 minutes
of the gains. Grinnell struck
back, when Justin Koestcr
