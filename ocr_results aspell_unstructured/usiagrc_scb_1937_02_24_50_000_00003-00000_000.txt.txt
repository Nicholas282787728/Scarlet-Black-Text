Arnold-Forster Advocates Extension 1
to Europe of System of Conferences

English Lecturer Sees
Progress for Peace
by New System

By WALTER ROWLEY

“If conference. as it was agreed
upon in the recent Pan-American
peace conference between the
United states and other south
.American nations, is a necessary
element in a cooperative peace
system, it would be well for the
United states to extend its policy
of the western hemisphere to
other parts of the World."

This was the key statement der
livered Tuesday evening by W.
Arnold-Furster, British laborite,
in the third of eight lectures he is
giving on the general topic of in-
ternational relations, He spoke
in Herrick chapel on the subject
of “Cooperation and Conference.”

Divides Talk

The speaker divided his talk in-
to three parts: consultation, rtrles
of peace keeping, and peace build-
ing servi e .

In reviewing the stand taken
by the United states in interna-
tional affairs, he said that this
country, before the last war, ins
sisted that states resort to con-
sultation before entering armed
conflict. He stated that in 1919,
President Wilson, in attempting to
develop this policy, became the
chief spokesman of the world on
that issue.

American Isolation

The first stages of American
isolation, materialized in the Hard-
ing administration.

“Pl'eSldenL liar mg,“ he said,
"before his election, indicated sup—
port of the League of Nations, but
after entering the presidency
nothing came of it, and the United
States proposed isolation instead.

“The next stage," he asserted,
was the per-rod of communication
between the United states and
the swiss and Dutch governments,
and, finally in 1927, the League
was no longer acceptable to Amen
iaen opinion."

Conference Idea

In summarizing the later stages
of United states participation in
world problems, he mentioned that
the idea of conference between
nations was under discussion in
1930, and that the action taken
by America had a great hearing
on disarmament at that time. He
added that you cannot prevent the
world from blowing up without
disarmament, but that it is al-
most impossible to have effective
disarmament without collective
security.

“In 1932 these facts and the
principle of conference were em»
phasized in the United States," he
said, and illustrated this point by
quoting the platforms of the Re
publican and Democratic par-ties
in the presidential election of that
same year.

Cautious Cooperation

"If your country wants to pur-
sue a policy of cautious coopera»
tion, if it means business by the
Kellogg pact, it must accept the
principle of conference in time of
crisis,” he declared.

He stated that it is desirable
that this sort of a system should
be organized in advance, and that
it should be followed with regular-
ity in the holding of consultations.

Recent Policy

In discussing the recent policy
of this country, the speaker said
that at the recent PanrAmerican
conference, thc United States pro-
posed a system of conference
throughout the western hemls»
pliezc in time of crisis. He then
stated that, since consultation is
such a necessary element in a co-
operative peace system, such
would he a contribution to other
parts of the world as well.

Turning to the second part of
his address dealing with the rules
for keeping peace, hc reviewed

two of the main rules stated in
the League of Nations covenant:
first, that any war which is de»
clared is to he at concern of the
whole League,‘ which may take
any action to safeguard the peace
of nations; and, Second, that in no
case may states resort to war un—
til they have turned to a peaceful
means of Settlement.
Peace Building Services

In discussing the third and last
part of his lecture, concerning
peace building services, the speak-1
er (Old of some of the Work that
is being accomplished by the
League, and illustrated by explaine
ing the work of the economic
committee in solving Austria and
of the work of the financial cum-
mittee,

“Yet all of the League's Walk
is being done through Amer-lean
inspiration,” he said, “After the
war, President Wilson founded the
League, and today American cr r
zens have contributed, voluntarily,
more to that organization than
Great Britain has done in cooper»
alien.”

Jubilant Students

Celebrate Victory Y
With ‘F lunk Day’

No definite faculty action had
been taken yet today in regard
to the rurofficial victory or “flunk
day" taken yesterday by the stu—
dents as a result of the basket—
ball victory over Creighton Mon<
day night, it was learned today.
It was the first win ever scored
by the Pioneers over Creighton
eagers.

Under the college rules, victory
days to be official must be called
by the student council. Yester-
day‘s affair was not sanctioned
by that body, and cuts will be
charged against all students who
did not attend class, it is believed

Students massed in the first
floor hall and stairways of Alum-
ni Recitation hall in a “sit-down”
strike to prevent students and
professors from gaining access to
classrooms on second and third
floors.

Several professors attempted to
hold eight o'clock classes, but
hordes of singing and yelling stue

In the majority of the cases, how-

Afternoon classes and lab

as usual as the unauthorized
