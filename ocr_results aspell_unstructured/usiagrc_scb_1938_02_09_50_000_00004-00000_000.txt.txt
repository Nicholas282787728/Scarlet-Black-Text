A MILESTONE

The action taken by the Student Council
last night in joining the nation-wide fight
against syphilis by laying plans for giving
the Wassermann test free to all students
who wish to take it is, as Betty Carnes, pre—
sident of the Women’s Self Governing assoA
ciation, so aptly put it, “a very progressive
idea."

As we pointed out ill these columns
several weeks ago, students availing them-
selves of this opportunity will not only be
doing themselves a seiyice but at the same
time will aid greatly in the elimination of
this great scourge to civilization.

The program as drawn up by the Student
Council during the last few months, has re-
ceived the endorsement of the Iowa State
Department of Health and the United States
Public Health Service. These organizations
have offered the services of their labora-
tories at Iowa City free of charge. The
Student Council has appointed a committee
to make arrangements with local physicians
to take the blood samples.

The men of Grinnell have already voted
their approval of the project We are con,
fident that the women will take similar
action at all early date.

When they do so, a milestone in Grinnell
history will have been reached. A milestone
which marks the advent of intelligent action
upon an issue which for too many years has
been obscured by false prudery and lack of
discussion and knowledge.

ANENT THE OPEN DOOR POLICY

For a moment yesterday we were startled
into the belief that a suggestion of ours had
been observed ’when we found both doors
unlocked and open between the library and
the Alumni Recitation hall.

A rapid check of other double doors, how-
ever, revealed that such was not the case
since all the outside doors were still only
half efficient.

Despite that fact, we feel a strong en-
couragement as we remember the feeling of
spaciousness given by the simple expedient
of opening two doors. Take it from us, there
really is something worthwhile about an
open door policy.

“HIGHER EDUCATION"

Higher education is popularly supposed to
give one superior intelligence, social polish,
ability to reason and various other desirable
charactelistics. That it actually produces
the above results is a much debated ques-
tion. Perhaps the following description of

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK'

the conduct ol‘ four students in four eastern
(they could be from any other section of the
country) colleges will illustrate a point.
“With a dispatch implying deliberate plan,
they repaired themselves to the club car
\\ here there was a bar. Here they proA
cccdcd to drink one another under, They
used the astonishing unbelievable (I aln
told) method of taking long draughts of
whiskey (they had brought six quarts
along) out of water glasses and following
them up with chasers (the right word I
hope) of gin (which they procured at the
bar).- This process, if carried too far (it's

easy to do it), results in a searing of the.

stomach wall and a premature embalming of
liver. Before long these twenty year old
adolescents were staggering, puking,
(Shakespear nses this word), souses. That
evening four of them had to be carried to
their berths.”

We do not belong to the W. C. T. U. nor
do we desire to. We are at the same time
not prudish.

The point is this: These four were college
students, supposedly above the average in
most respects. Yet their conduct showed
less respect for others, and themselves, and
less self control, than we would expect
from very young children,

Is this then what higher education means.
Your answer is probably of course not, we
never act like that. Perhaps so, for this is
admittedly an extreme example but the
tendencies in this case carried to the ex,
treme are frequently found in lesser degree.

If in the depths of your heart you must
needs answer yes to the question, then it is
time to think about what can be done about
it.

YOUR PAPER, IF YOU PLEASE

For some time now the SCARLET AND
BLACK has, in common with most other
college newspapers, attempted to present in
the editorial columns comment and dis,
cussion on events of importance not directly
related to life on the campus. In doing this
the editors have assumed that the students
were interested in events which, while they
do not directly affect them, do profoundly
affect the world of which we all are a part.

At the same time, however, the editors
have realized that the editorial columns are
the least read feature in the paper, to the
extent that even when controversial campus
issues are aired in these columns no re-
action is evident.

The cditors therefore, realizing that this
is a student paper, your paper, if you
please, invite your comment on the type of
matter you believe should be included in
these columns, or in other departments of
the paper. Your suggestions will receive
careful consideration.

MOVIE MOVIEST.

(Reprinted from the Daily O’Collegian)

The movie industry has [become superla-
tively conceited. A big fraction of recent
productions are built around motion pictures
subject. The public is becoming tired of
this thing.

Certainly there is no dearth of good
movie plots. To be sure, motion picture
production is a glamorous industry, but
lnuch of this arises from the fact that it is
mysterious. The lovely blond siren looks
no better on the street than a coed and
probably not half so well if she had to make
all eight a. m, class after studying late into
the night.

People like to picture screen stars as they
are in the roles they play. A grease-paint
and arc light industry is not glamorous and
the movie executives should realize this.

'They think the world is just waiting to

hear their secretsia fallacy, for nobody
cares about them so long as they make good
pictures .

Before the public actually turns thumbs
down on more “Hollywood” films, leaders in
the industry should go outside their own
house for subjects. of course, it is much
less expensive to film a movie about a
movie, but the box office is the ultimate
place where the money comes from
