S+uden+ Faces Coming Exams
Carrying Con'Fusing Nol'ebook

By Arlene Cleveland

Seeing as it‘s finals time of. the year, I find myself
reviewing various outlines, diagrams and class notes, plus
reading for the first time numerous texts untouched since

the last hour exams.

My history notes prove
small ship on which sever
America in 1620; the son of a
Russian czar is a Czardine; the
Congress of Vienna met in Pit-
tsburg; larrners are sometimes
relerred to as pheasants; and
during the French Releuticn
crowned heads were trembling
in their shoes.

Dr. King’s class pointed out
that Samson was the greatest
actor in the Bible because he
brought down the house. The
Soc department claimed the
United states is mostly popu—
lated hy people, the chief
cause at divorce is marriage.
while the climate of the
Sahara is such that it’s inhah.
itano have to live elsewhere.

A ﬂash irom the Air Force
faction revealed that strategy is
when you are out of ammuni-
tion but keep right on firing so
the enemy won't know. Also.
the new drill rifles weigh 8.69
pounds. After you’ve carried it
a while, the decimal point drops
out. And the new draft slogan
tor '57 is: “Maybe we can‘t make
you right, but we can take you
where the fighting is, and you

My theories on classical mu-

day this kind of music will
turn into a tune. similarly,
our government lecture stated
that we have protected the
lndians by putting them on
reservoirs. And my critical
analysis oi a Grinnell student
production is always written
under ball conditions _ I saw
the show while the curtain
was up.

Through personal experience,
at irnals time i find my scheds
ule exceedingly rushed, what
with all the cramming and
social events coinciding, And
after working out the following
statistics (naturally not before
taking Freshman Orientation),
I discovered that i, like the
rest of Grinnell students, spend
the year literally lolling around
in idleness — here’s my proof: ‘
