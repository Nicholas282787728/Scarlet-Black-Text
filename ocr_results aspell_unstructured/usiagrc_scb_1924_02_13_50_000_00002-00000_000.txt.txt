Dean Sperry‘s triangles#he has given
us something more to talk about! 1

Those oi us who have been discus-
sing Count Kessler and his message
seem to be divided into two camps.
Some oi us accepted his statements
and his plea for his country and gulp;
ed them whole, without seasoning. And
we have been smugly complacent ever
since over our ability to eat things we
don't like . . . proud oi the maguanim-
ous point of View with which we rec
gttvd our late enemy.

On the other hand, there has seemed
to be a vehement minority among us
who, like 9. few Veterans of Robert ID.
Lee's army, are still finding it hard
to forget that the war is over.

We might all be forgiven for adding
a grain or two of salt to a few oi
Count Kessler’s ideas. In discussing
the Ruhr, he declared that Germany
would undoubtedly hove had too much
common sense to do what France has
done; which may be true. lucidently,
howevcr, \he made the sweeping state—
ment that Germany, under no mu.
ditions, could ever be prevailed upon
to break her word; which is under.-
iabir a little hard for us to swallow.
Then, hastily, he assured us that in

-tho case oi the 1914 invasion ct Bol-
lgium, the one occasion on which Ger

many did break Iler \\'oi’tl, she fully
intended to maize thing right with
Belgium it little later on.

we may all be guilty oi a iainr
suspicion that the Count is cherishing‘
misc illusions in regard to his Valer-
Izlrld. Too few years have ClﬂDSCfl
since the end or the war ior us to be
entirely iree irom prejudice. not it
is precisely in these remnants of hate

seeds of the obstacles to world peace
tulle root and flourish.

We can allow these‘unpleusant rals

session of us; or we can make an
honest effort to listen to the truth,

wherever we hear it, with unhiassed

minds.

You won’t fumble this cap!

Professional jugglers could handle the old.
style shaving cream caps and never once drop
one down the drain or under the bath tub.
But for most of us, this new Williams Hinge-
Cap puts an end to an ancient nuisance.

Williams Shaving Cream is just as much
pleasamer to use as is the Hinge-Cap. It
softens the board with uncanny speed. . The
thicker lather holds the moisture in against
the skin where it is needed. This lather lu-
bricates the skin, too, so that painful razor
