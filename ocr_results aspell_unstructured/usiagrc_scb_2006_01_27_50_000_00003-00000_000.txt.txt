The write stuff:

by SARAH PlERCE

Despite their name, the Literary Hooligans dour wreak havoc
upon libr1ries or English seminars, violently correcting rr1rnrnar
and ci ‘ng ianious works of literature. Instead, the new group tries to
keep its meetings lively through other unorthodox activities. They
meet every week to write about everything from mental illness and
unicorns to death and sweatshirts.

During an average meeting the group is presented wtth ii prompt,
which can vary from a walk down the train tracks to synesthesia to
Paul Beatty's poem “Dibbab.”

“One time it was just a line of chalk drawn across the chalk
board,"s:lid Adam Barrett '08, one ofthe group’s founders. “Basically
you take whatever the prompt is, write whatever you feel like that
inspires and go in whatcvcr direction you want."

For some group members,thar direction entails confronting per
sonal issues.

“I am bipolar. Last year was the ﬁrst year I was finally diag-
nosed, and it was a really traumatic year to a degree," membchin»
sley l’lunsdarfcr ’08 said. “To be able to not only write about it, but
to go to these people whom I trusted and I respected 7 to be able
to share this with them knowing that I wouldn’t be judged and that
leould get support from them, while at the same time looking at
my writing from a more objective standpoint 7 was a very helpiirl
thing for me. 1 think we all kind of help
each other reach kind ora greater under. :
standing of ourselves by hearing what our
friends write."

Literary Hooligans started last year
when a group of about eight friends
wanted more opportunities to express '
themselves creatively “I just wanted a way to keep [writing] up that
was in a notesoestructured environment,” said one of the group's
founders, Jamie Zwiebel ’08. “We started meeting informally, just to
write. And slowly it started to form into a stronger group."

Accoiding to Barrett, the group became more organized this
year. This year the group had a booth at the organizations fair, put

anthology

They write together and can either share their works, turn them
, in for the anthology or take them home

to continue to work
‘ For another student, Erin Sindewald
’08, the experience is more about ens
joyment and writing and less about an
_: emotional release. “For me personally, it
is just about the fun," Sindcwald said. "I
like being around writers the same age,com1ng from different levels
ofeitperience and backgrounds.“

The fall semester anthology, “The Writer's Guide to Mayhem

and Madness,”wi]l soon be available in the post office,

The political and economic elite gone wild

The Fierce People: A trace of the Amazon in New York’s wealthy suburbs

The Yanoi-riarno tribe of South America (known to anthro-
pologists and other social scientists as “the fierce people") and the
highfalutin upper class in the United States may have more in
common than would be atpectcd. Dirk Wittenborn continuall-
draws parallels between the two groups in T/MFitrt: People, which
raises the question, Who would win in a fight?"

Tia Fizz-re Purple 1s a fictional' account of a struggling, drugv
addicted hippy (is that redundant?) and her adolescent son, Finn
Earl, moving from a small apartment in New York City to a sub-
urb occupied by the wealthiest people in the nation and those who
serve them. The motif of the Yanomamo permeates the novel.
nuns father who abandoned the family, is a leading expert on the
Yanomamo, and Finn maintains an interest in the tribe. Ironically,
while a major theme in the novel is Finn’s desire to accompany his
academic father to South America to live with the Yanomama,
Finn and his mother encounter a group of people in the suburbs
who equal or surpass the ﬁerceness of the tribe. Activities such
as murder, adultery incest, alcoholism, corruption, drug addition,
competition, nepotism and sexual ptomiscuity are rife in the com-
munity of the ultraeelite, their progeny and those who cater to
their whims.

While the novel has a solemn undertone of class jealousy and
enmity, the. book is ﬁlled with humor and the carefree bliss of
youth. Such'a contrast makes the reader feel disoriented at times.
The novel begins with Finn waking up to his mother moaning,
“Oh my God," which, according to Finn, “mean[t] one of two
things: either something had caught ﬁre in the toaster oven again,
or Mom had a new boyfriend."

Km and his mother function as a bridge between the upper
class and those below them, as Finn’s mother is only able to reins
cate her family to the suburbs because of a patriarch of the wealthy
community. Her duties to this man are ambiguous, as are many
ofthe relationships professions, backgrounds and motives ofthe
characters' in the novel.

Dirk Wittcnborn has written a fierce account of the upper
class and their relations within their own constituents and other
classes. While comprised predominantly of humor and ﬁnds
journey through adolescence, the novel is also critical of upper7
class greed 1nd treatment of other classes. Yet by the end of the
novel, we see that wealth may engender just as much ferocity as
the Amazon

All the King 5 Men: Power- hungry politicians with a penchant for hard alcohol

“The deﬁnitive novel about American politics,” screams the
cover of Robert Penn Warren's All The King’s Men, somewhat inn
accurately. The novel is about American politics the same way
Cal-yin and Hobber is about a stuﬂ'ed tiger or Romeo andjuliez is
about Italian Renaissance marriage practices. sure, the novel has
politics in it. But the politics are more setrscenes to the emotional
action than the action itself.

The novel details the dictatorial gevernorship ofWillic Stark,
known as "The Boss." Stark is loosely based on realrlifc Hucy
Long, who was governor and then senator of Louisiana in the
1930s. stark begins as a sincere champion ofthe common people.
Unfortunately; like every other Character in the novel, within five
pages Stark becomes a disillusioned dictae
tor. The politics are less Wart Wing, more
King Lam. Stark never talks with anyone
or tries to come at anything democrati-
cally. He just barks out orders and then
swears and drinks.

While Stark occupies the novel’s center,
the action of the novel focuses on Stark’s
conﬁdant Jack Burden, the novel’s narrar
tor, Jack might just be the most cynical character in the whole of
American literature, Arrer a couple of pages, a reader will feel, like
Jack, that life is a pointless characle and the only thing left to do
is retreat to 1 bar and bitteily member an idealistic past. Jack's
personal life gets entwined in his work, and evenru lly, everything
around him crumbles. While at some points digression:
sccm to distract from the compuluvely interest g stark, they

build to a conclusion ﬁtting ofGroek tragedy
, Jack Burdcn’s voice brings to mind MarkTwain nursing a real
ly bad hangover atter being jiited by a mean girlfriend. It sounds
‘ and conversational like Twain’s, but when the punchvljne
hits, as bitter. A typical Jack Burden conversation goes, jack:
“You know what I mean?” Woman: “Yes."lack: “Like hell you do."
A deep violence runs beneath the book‘s prose, foreshadowing the
fall of Governor Stark, People don’t eat or drink a thing, they do
damage to it, sandwiches, cakes and (of course) bottles of whis-
ke .
yWarren started the novel in Italy in 1939, when the fascist
threat rumbled on his doorstep, and the novel was published
shortly after the end of the Second
World War, While the plot explores the
psychology of a dictator, obviously a big-
ger issue in 1946 than in 2006,1ct’s hope,
the human drama in the middle of the
politics is essentially timeless. A movie
version of the book, starring Sean Penn
and Jude Law, is slated to come out late
this year.

Somehow, despite the bitterness and the tragedy, lack Burden
keeps on living, and we read his story Because of this, a certain
vein of hope and beauty runs through rhe book, even in its most
desperate places. Life can still be beautiful, and, even after every»
thing, some people will survive. As Ame1 iea again faces a political
crisis, that message may still give us coini’rut.
