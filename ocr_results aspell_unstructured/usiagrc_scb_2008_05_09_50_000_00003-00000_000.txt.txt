Free lunches from Chuong Garden and other local restau-
rants have long been one oftlie perks ofpoiiring hours into stut
dent government. But recently, some senators have been taking
steps towards ending this mealtime practice.

This weekloint Board voted on and rejected a resolution to
end spending on lunch for cabinet members'l‘hough the reset
lution failed, students, Cabinet members and the SGA advisor
are considering new options.

Laura Lieneniaiin '08 originally raised the issue in Joint
Board during the soapbox portion oia February Joint Board
session. According to the February 27 Joint Board Minutes,
Lienemann expressed her disapproval otrree lunches rot cabi-
net members from restaurants in town during their brweekly
meetings.

More recently Loosehead Senator Anna Gilbert ’09 for—
mulated a proposition to end spending on cabinet lunches a
resolution with fellow congralu Senator Greg Hudson ’09.
Gilbert said that cabinet members should be able to provide
theii lunches,

“The Cabinet money, that money does come fiom SGA,"
said Gilbert. “And I find it difﬁcult to believe that students who
are on meal plans and salaried through cabinet can't provide
their own lunches."

According to AssistantTreasurer Emily Wax '09, in Febru-
ary cabinet began buying groceries instead ofurilering food for
their noontime meetings. Wax said costs arc now one third of
wlnlt they were last semester, dropping from 51800 to soot) per
semester,

pressed concern over efforts to eliminate spending on lunches

the air, but on Wednesdays they re asking administrators to
come and expecting them to bring their own lunch is pretty
rude.’l‘his is students meeting administrators and saying “don't
go to lunch, come talk to us," said Hinds-Brush.

Hinds-Brush explained that other options had been con—
sidered but that none proved to be effective or an improvement
on current spcnding. “We looked into [dining hall Catering]
and it would cost just as much, if not more than to buy snrrf.
Even if they use meal plans, there are still people who live on
campus and administrators who don’t have meal plans,” said
HindStBrush. HindstBrush also said that they looked into air
ther having everyone getting outtakes or just eating in the din
ing hall but she said that wasn't feasible because it would take
too long and people wouldn't be together at the same time,
Licnemann recognized that current funding for lunches has “no
direct effect on funding for other groups as the money is cur

rcntly earmarked for Cabinet Discretionary funds." However,
Lienemann said that spending on lunches is not necessary be-
cause Cabinet members have easy access to food in the JRC.
“Now with pay increase and with the dining hall, the grill and
[outtakes] and the ofﬁces near each other, they have access to
food," said Lienemann. She added that faculty does not have
lunch paid for during facility meetings and that they pay for
lunches themselves,

John Burrows ’10, Senator for OCNCO and Vice President
of Student Affairs elect, said he does not support the complete
elimination of spending, especially during meetings with ad-
ministrators. “We’ll still have to spend some money when adt
ministrators attend meetings,"said Burrows.

CLARE PATERSON

According to Burrows, the resolution ﬁliled this semester
primarily as a result of the language in the resolution and not
as a response to the effort to end spending on student lunches.
“Resolution didn‘t have strici guidelines saying what cabinet
can not do Next fall there should be a resolution with stricter
guidelines," said Burrows.

some members ofSGA, such as incoming Treasurer Emily
Wax ’09, believe that there are larger issues than purchasing
weekly lunches. "Ifyou want to be worked up about something
[in the budget], there are a lot oflrirger issues to be worked up
about," said Wax,

WInd turbines themselves, “There
”om P- 1 is going to he ﬁnancial provi-
sions for those that are within a certain distance
of the turbine and the turbine is not directly on
their land," said Associate Director of Facilities
Management Whitney. “Within a quarter mile
there is an audio and visual impact, and we will
compensate the landowners for that.”

The initial cost of the turbines will be ap,
proximately 33 million; the school expects a re-
turn on their investment in about 14 years.The
school plans to us: all of the energy that the tur—
bines generate. “To avoid [wasting electricity],
FM suggested to use the energy to heat water
since we always have boilers going," said sorter.

once the school is able to acquire the land
and clear certain hurdles, including permitting,
the school will then begin to take proposals
from diﬁ’erent wind turbine manufacturersThe
school plans to build four 900~kilowatt turbines
each generating three to four megawatts of
power.

Even with such progress on the turbines,
current juniors should not expect to see them
before they graduate, as they won’t appear on
the Grinncll landscape until mid 2010. With
size and location taken into consideration, the
turbines will be visible from the second ﬂoor of
the JRC, “I'll come and visit,” said FTP meme
ber Andrew Fair ’09, “But most importantly,
smdents need to keep carbon reduction on the
front burners."

“We'll see whether there's
any room for maneuver, but
at the moment it looks like there isn‘t any," said
Osgood.

The manner in which the ban will be one
forced on campus has not hem decided. Russ
Motta, Security, declined to oomment, as admin-
istrators have not yet determined how it will be
incorporated into campus policy.

Vice President of Student Aﬁ’airs Houston
Dougharty said that changes would be made
to campus smoking policy. If its a state law, it
means thatwe have to change campus policy, he
said "it would be our respons ty as a college
to be sure that we are in compliance With state
law."

Dougharty said he believed the most direct
enforcement would be through self governance
and the RLC. “One would hope that self gow
emance would rise to the occasion, too, and say
‘you guys, we don't have a droice here, this isn't a
choice we made,” said Dougharty “My hope is
that it would get resolved in that way. Butcuh
tures are diﬂﬁeult to shift."

Changes would also be made in the process
of making the lounge a smoke-free area, but
Dougharty said he could not speak to speciﬁcs
“I think it’ll have to be kind of an educational
campaign," he said. “There may be some paint-
ing and some other things that happen in there
over the summer to give a fresh look and a fresh
feel,"

Though many students are distraught about
the smoking ban, many are also skeptical about
how seriously students will take the change
“Taking away the smoking lounge isn't too big a
deal,m said Charlie White '09. “People will probe
iiblyjust smoke in their rooms, and then: is really
very little that can bc done about that as long as
it isn't bothering anybody."
