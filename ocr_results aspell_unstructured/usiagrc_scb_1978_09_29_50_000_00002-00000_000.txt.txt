Iowa colleges try to cope.
with new liquor law

by Dan Flynn
Changes in Iowa’s drinking
laws are causing problems at
many colleges across the smte
At Cornell College, Dean of Stud-
ents Susan Green Crim, formerly
an assistant dean at Grinnell, has
decreed that. copies of the new law
be posted along with announce-
ments for parties. PM“
Luing. coreditor (ll Cornell‘s
student paper. comments that
although the school will probably
card students at. large parties,
smallparties will go unmolested.
Margaret Grove, university
editor of the Iowa State Daily, says
that lSU's Office of Student Life
has been pushing for more non—
alcohol parties. The otticevhas gone
so far as to publish a tempting list
of non-alcoholic mixed drinks.
Although ISU’s alcohol policy tor
house parties is still unsettled,
buying alcohol with house funds is
currently banned.
“We're sort of in limbo until the

board 0‘ trustees meets and issues
a policy." comments , Lisa
Billingham. editor of the C06
College newspaper, For the time
being, though, use of student
senate lunds forvalcohol has been
prohibited.

Some of the more extreme
measures to prevent minors from
consumption of alcohol have been
taken by the University of Nor~
them Iowa. Theret Chris Kyser,
news editor of the lnwan, reports
that not only can house funds no
longer be used for the purchase of
liquor, but also all hail parties
must have guards posted at all
doors to check l.D.'s, In addition,
elevators cannot stop at floors on
which parties take place.

Although none of the schools has
set a permanent policy, the reeling
at most of the schools is that——
whatever the policyAunderaged
students will still find some way to
consume liquor.
