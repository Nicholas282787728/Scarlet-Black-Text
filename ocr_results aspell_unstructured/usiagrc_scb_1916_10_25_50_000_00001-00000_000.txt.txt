being roundcd into shape, and will be
definitely available within a short

out yesterday at the College Office.

One of ‘the interesting feature. or
the plan is to give next year's Seniors
the first choice at roan ._ Thc‘ Juniors
will be given sccoud preference, and
so on down to thc Freshmen. In this
way. every mail now in collcgc will

The "exact method of choosing the
house groups has not yet bccu determ—
incd, but it will be dlltcl'ent from the
elective system new used by tho lllen's
houses. Application for admission to-
lhc dormitories will probably be re

The price of room rent is uudctcrnr

throughout, no extra charge being
made for the more desirable locar

authorities to .chfu'ge an amount suf-

operated for profit. The details of tllc

Coc is prcparmg for the biggest

cording to all reports sent bilt'from
that institution. In a. news article in
yesterday‘s Coo Cosmos it speaks of
the game as “the biggcst event in Iowa
Conference circles this full."

“Coe wants the game and wants it
bad." ys ihc Cosmos. “but in View of
the pcrrormancc of Grillllell in the
Iowa game and the large scores piled
up in their smaller games it is thought
that to will will necessitate the inter»
rentinll of demo fortune on top of all
physical force that supporters of the
Crimson and gold can produce. The
contention that Coc has a good team
will not he denied by anvouc, but when
a team including several new men in
old shoes is sent against a veteran
slutc championship aggregation a vies
tory for the former is almost outside
the range of probability. However,
should the luck break all for Coo.

gct caught in air pockets. it is thought
that tile mmgm of score will he a 'm-~
up.’ Slloulil things go their way it is
thought that there is liltlc doubt as
to the outcome or the game.”

A little different view is expressed
in the cdltoritll on tho “Homecoming.”
Coc's first homecoming was hcld four
years ago. at which iimc Coc llclil
Cor-itch do. A ycar latm' Grlmielr was

Tbc score of Saturday‘s game will be
nothing likc that of two years ago. for
the two contending tennis are evenly
malehcd this year. The game will be
very hard and thc score will be close.
but the coaches. the team. the students
and the alumni are going to gi c their

‘best, to win and to maintain Coe's

Homecoming traditions."

Saturday will be a big day in Cedar
Rapids. A football gamc between the
(Joe Fr lunch and Jlaquohetc High
School is scheduled for 10:30 in the
morning. A big homecoming luncheon
will be held at noon. followed by tho
Coc-Grnlnell game at till-cc, 1n the
