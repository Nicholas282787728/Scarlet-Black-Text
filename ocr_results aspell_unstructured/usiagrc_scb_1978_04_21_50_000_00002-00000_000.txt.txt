Remember Pat Walsh.

~h third. the day when the son's iront»pagc story about
Pat \\ Isll‘s mysterious parking ticket caper appeared. Hilary
tiago. a Grinnell senior, was spendriig the aitei-noon babysitting ior
the young child at sociology prolessor Chris Hunter When
iiirnter returned home. he handed Hilary a copy oi the paper and
told her there was an article in it that she should read.

As Hilary perused the story. she immediately became “pretty
lilotrn antly” as she realized that the car Walsh was accused of
illegally parking was. in tact, the one she drives. which belongs to
her boyiriend. Hilary grabbed a phone and tried to contact Pat
Walsh. but was unable to reach him. She then called a policeman
she knew. who told her to come down to the police station. Once
there. she spoke to Bonnie nortell. the “nicterperson” who had
ticketed the ear Bortcl] told Hilary that she had to pay only three
dollars. one dollar tor each parking Violation. and that all charges
against Walsh would be dropped. .

Thus ended the strange case at the citizens oi iowa versus
Patrick Walsh Pat took the whole attair in philosophical. foul»

New Constitution discussed

by Ruth) wiltlioitc

The Student Government
Association began considering the
proposed new SG/t Constitution at
the Joriit Board meeting last
Wedne ay night

Discus on oi the new Cons
strtution is expected to last ior
several more meetings

One 0! the most cuntroversml (If
the proposed changes in the
Constitution IS the election of three
atlargc Joint Board members in
addition to the present 22 hall and
bircampus representatives, The
proponents hope that this in
novation virll allow tor a better
representation til the entire student
body. though they view it strictly
as “an experiment " Several
representatives. howt‘vcr.
suggested that students are
already adequately reprcscntcd
and there is no need for such a
change

ANOTHER suggested cons
strtutronai amendment is the re-
cstablisiimenl til lull year ter
tor Joint Board members, ’1‘
year was the lust year that mid»
year elections have been held and
this procedirrc has resulted in
many problems The reason to.-
instituting midyear clcctioiis was
to make each rep more responsible

li' you liked the Pat Walsh story.
then you‘ll love this one,

The lacts.

Renae Reese. a sophomore irom
Des Moines. recently purchased a
bicycle from a fellow Student. She
asked her father, Guy ”Red"
Reese. to come out to Grinnell to
pick up the hike. It turned out Mr
Reese was going to be in the
vicinity Tuesday. and decided he
would pick up the bicycle at that
time

Mr. Reese works lor the Wonder
Bread Company That's how he
makes his dough On Tuesday, he
was drivinga Wonder Bread truck.
He made a delivery in Newton. and
then came to Grinnell to pick up
the bicycle.

It was a simple task Mr Reese
loaded the bike into the truck and
returned to Des Moines. But some
students saw him take the bicycle
and they took the innocent Mr

lohis dorm. but the result has been
to “give him an easy way out oi
responsibility," according to
Gregg Ybutz “It really slowed
down the progress of the Joint
Board.” said Paul Carter Not only
were unity and eliictency lost,
stated Youtz. but “innumerable
administrative hassles” resulted
lrom the mid-year elections.

Another proposed change in the
Constitution is the establishment of
:1 Judicial Council procedure for
constitutional interpretation.
ii hieli ( i'tcr called necessary and

the last court oi appeal "

THE REVISED Constitution also
includes such redelinltions as the
removal of the Social Coordinator
t‘rom the cabinet and changing the
emphasis oi the Student Coors
dinator‘s jot) irom investigation to
service

During the meeting. Robert's
Rules oi tlrder were suspended tor
~45 minutes. so that a less restricted
discussion could ensue in a quasi
committee at the whole. Although
no amendments were made and no
votes were taken. the hall
representatives made comments
on the proposed document. and
they will introduce amendmens at
next week's meeting.

THE Constitutional Reiorm
Committee. which presented the

lice pinch a

Reese to be a bicycle thiei The
students reported the incident to
the Grinnell police.

The police swung into action.
They discovered a Wonder Bread
truck in the McNally's parking lot.
They entered the store and in
formed the Wonder Bread
deliveryman that they wanted him
to answer a Iew questionsiat the
police station.

The truck driver demanded to
know what it was all about The
police told him he was suspected of
stealing a bicycle and putting it in
his truck. The deliveryman showed
them the back at his truck. it was
stacked full of bread, No bicycle

Then the deliveryman went on
to explain that he had had a can
yersution with Mr. Reese that
morning and knew that Reese was
going to pick up his daughter‘s
bike. The police dcmined the
deliveryman an hour and a hall

Although the Constitutional
Reform Committee originally set
out to institute major changes. the

according to Cornelius The
committee received very little
response to their requests to other

student government organizations

working model to tollow. we didn't
go tor drastic changes." said
Cornelius.

Des Moines. and they conlirmed
the deliveryman's explanation
Renae was also called upon to help
clear the air Finally. the
deliveryman was released.

Anyone with a wry sense of
humor can imagine the
pOSStbilitieS in this situation. At the
very yeast. er. least. we can safely
say that neither Mr Reese. nor the
other truck driver. were loairng on
the iob.

But the Wonder Bread Company
is worried They are afraid that the
several students \tho believed they
saw a theit. and the people in
McNally’s tihb Saw the
deliveryman taken away. now
have a bad image oi the company
So. to you readers who might have
these mistaken impressions.
please be assured that the Wonder
people are scrupulously honest and
above bread. er. board
