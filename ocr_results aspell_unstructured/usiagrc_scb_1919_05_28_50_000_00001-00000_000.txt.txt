can withhold awarding credit for the
most successful glee club Grllmell has

"That was a good one, Bill," "Ye'Il

“It’s your pitch, SI." "Make it a ringer-
this time.” “B’Gosh yc done it. Give
’cm three, Pete." ”i reckon that's a
game, ain't it? Wall, we’ll jest pitch
ye another for good luck, eh, Si? It's
your ﬁrst pitch, Ezry.”

The old village ﬁxtures have re-
moved themselves from their former
foundations in front of the drug store
on the corner and have established
themselves where they can be amused
by the claug, clung of the horseshoes
as they are pitched from one strike
to another, in that old, arlswcrauc
game at quoits.

They say that It IS an 11] wind that
