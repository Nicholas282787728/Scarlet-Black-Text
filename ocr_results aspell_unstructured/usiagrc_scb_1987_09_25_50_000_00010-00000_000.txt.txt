How it feels to
be back

by Lisa Grant

”So how’s it feel to be back in
Grinnell?” Hell. I don’t know, How
should l feel? i realize that people
are just trying to be iriendly, but in
all honesty. it seems like a dumb
question to me. Not “How was
Japan?" or "How’s it feel to be
back in the U,S.'?,” hut “How’s it
feel to be back in Gtinnell’!“

And yet, upon reﬂection, maybe
it isn’t such a stupid question to
ask, just parochial. Grinnell is
home to all of us six months out of
the year. Most of my acquain-
tances and friends have never been
to my “real” home (now in D.C. m
my family moved again). What
they know of me is literally in
separable from this place. As far
as they are concerned, Grinnell is
the only context I have. Sodespite
the fact that I spent a year in
Japan, in an entirely different
world, most people can‘t see it. It‘s
not written on my shirt or tattooed
on the bridge of my nose;
therefore, subjectively. the year
doesn’t really exist. For the near-
sighted, ! now answer the question.
“HOW does it feel to be back in
Grinnell?”

I HATE IT.

Direct? Offensive? Extreme?
Yes. But I do have times when I
wish I wasn’t here. Not because it
IS Grinnell, but because it ISN'T
Tokyo.

Grinnell is a special place. [love

year. l ieel like I've been chopped
in halt, unable to convey what hapr
pened to me last year to people
here. On the other hand, I missed
out on a year of the GE that all my
friends have, and they're having
problems relating to me what hap-
pened here. I have a queer sense oi
dislocation, sort of like being out of
phase with the rest of the world,

I can just hear the stiﬂed groans
every time i preiace a sentence
with “In Japan . . ." or “Last year
in Japan . . or “Well, in Japan ..
. It‘s gotten to the point where i
just don't say much anymore. The
incredible experiences I had just
don't exist for anyone else. And I
imagine people get tired of listen-
ing to me constantly talk about
Japan. But it's the only way I have
of telling others what I experienc-
ed. At the same time. it helps me
integrate last year in Japan with
the here-and-now of Grinnell.

l should be more generous and
patient with those who can't step
away irom the cramped context in
which they exist. After all, I have
an entire unique year’s worm of
impressions, recollections, anecs
dotes, and experiences, while they
have nothing that‘s particularly
out of the ordinary, Besides, in
part my inability to cope with
returning to Grinnell alter a year

‘away has created my sense or
dislocation. I, too. need to re-adjust
the context in which I live, back
towards the universal GE
everyone knows and loves. And I
think i know the periect way to
begin. The next time someone asks

Town and gown

Continued from Page 9

it is not just irom underclassmen.
in my three years here i have
never been hassled by the teen-age
townspeople and have been treated
with great respect by the merr
chants oi Grinnell. One cannot
justify shoplifting and negative at-
titudes towards the town by stating
that the college gives so much to
the community because it is un-
true. I will concede that the college
does provide some valuable uppers

reached the point oi near-totals
enervation in regard to conducting
any serious consideration of its
primary business. the overall
strength and character of the cur
riculum. Each iaculty member
seems to have retreated primarily
to his or her own areas ol specialty,
secondarily to his or her departs
ment's major and appears to have
devoted no attention or thought to
the overall curriculum of the Col»
lege. I think that it is time for the
faculty to stand up and accept
some of the authority and respon-
sibility for monitoring is cur
riculum that have been granted to
it by the College's Articles of Incor-
poration, by its By-Laws and by
the liberal manner in which those
By-Laws have been applied during
the past several years. 1 also think
that it is time for the administra-
tion to assume the role of leader-
ship in the direction of curricular
change.

Second. I believe that the [aculv
ty’s interest in the general educa-
tion program has reached the
lowest level that I have observed in
the thirty years that I have been
here. I realize that the phrase
“general education" is capable of
a variety or meanings. 1 don‘t wish
to attempt to define it for the Col
lege’s use. but for the sake of this
discussion, let me explain that my
definition implies that the general
education is represented by in
tegrative interdisciplinary courses
that are required of all students,
Emphasis on courses and pro»
grams in general education at
Grinnell has fallen off to the extent
that I would be at a loss to know
where to turn to select a committee
of five or six faculty members who
would be very interested in con
sidering die reactivation of this
very important element of the Col-
lege‘s curriculum. Very few of our
new faculty members come to us
with training in general education
from their graduate institutions,
General education is something

ment and eyperlence

nell, but we have it pretty good
here, and the town is exceptionally
tolerable. I come from a town that
has a large university within its
limits, and I understand the resents
ment that must be ielt by high»
school students who lose potential
jobs throughout the school year
and the summer to college
students from other states. It is
oiten very aggravating, but it is a
situation that cannot be resolved
as neither the college nor the town
has the ability to pick itseli up and
move.

In summary 1 suggest that the
next time that you underage

working in a craft. if there are not
faculty members in each genera
tion who learn the craft of teaching
in the areas oi general education
and pass it on to subsequent
generations, it will soon become
lust. Clearly, the administration
cannot pass on this craft. If we do
not revitalize this important area,
no one will be available to carry on
this traditional hallmark of the
liberal arts at Grinnell, i.e., the
College’s interested in general
education.

It is interesting to note here that
in early August, the American
Council on Education released its
publicaton entitled Campus
'n-ends. will which, in part, ads
dresses the topic about which I
speak. Two oi the major iindings of
that report are that 95% of the four
year colleges that were sampled
have implemented major curs
ricular changes since 1980 and that
75% of those Colleges and univer-
sities involved in such changes
have instituted general education
requirements.

I sincerely hope that the ad-
ministration and the faculty can be
stimulated to take some action in
regard to the two areas which I
have mentioned. If we can’t do so. I
believe that the recently improved
strength of the College may begin
to weaken sooner than one would
expect. Several very strong
features of the college's character
have moved it into a much
stronger position than it has ever
beiore experienced, Without cur»
ricular improvement and
strengthening, those changes will
hold the College at this level of
quality for only a short period oi
time.

observers oi the best are always
sharper-eyed and much less
forgiving than observers of the
next-toethe best. Small faults in a
college‘s quality become much
more easily visible when it is coma
pared with others of the nationally
recognized top institutions. Ever-
present critics at colleges or quali-
ty levels both above and below the

think about just how oppressive the
township really is on Grinnell

have never seen a police oilicer

survellance to see if cracks in its
quality have started to appear.
Once such fault lines have been
identified. observers delight in
passing on the news. Once this has
happened. no amount at marketing
effort or of increase in the endow-
ment will make easy the regaining
of the strong position which the
College currently holds,

I believe that the growth of Grin-
nell's overall strength is a reality.
However, what about the general
character of Grinnell’s Curr
riculum? Does it really have any
character? Is Grinnell really in-
vesting enough effort and energy
in strengthening its primary
reason for its existence? How long
will we continue to try to convince
ourselves that the best course of
action in regard to the College's
curriculum is maintaining the
status quo? I believe that this posi-
tion is taken simply to justliy
following the easiest course; that
of doing nothing. How long can we
continue to make jokes about how
this iaculty cannot develop and ap~
prove any major change? It is
possible that in regard to its Cur-
riculum, Grinnell has built a
vascular system that is very
strong but it has not paid the pro-
per attention to strengthening the
heart which that vascular system
serves. No matter how strong an
arterial system is. in the long run,
it cannot do the work of a weak
heart.

Grinnell has an academically
oriented Prestdent who has public-
ly expressed hlS desire to devote
more of his time and effort to
academic and curricular concerns.
it has a new and very committed
Dean of the Faculty who is in-
terested in curricular concerns
and who is quite willing to provide
the administrative hands-on
leadership that is necessary for
curricular reform. I invite the
faculty to share with the ads
minstratlon in taking the initiative
to overcome the factors that have
made curricular reform a seems
