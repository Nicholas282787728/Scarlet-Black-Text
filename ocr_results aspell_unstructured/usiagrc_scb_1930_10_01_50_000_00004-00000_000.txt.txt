Grinnell Wins

Over Wesleyan
Beneath Lights

Pioneers Defeat Champions
of Iowa Conference
by 19-0 Score

With most of the plays working
with remarkable accuracy. Coach
Lester Watt‘s untried Grinnell team
smashed its way to a 19-0 victory
over the lowa Wesleyan eleven here
Saturday night

This game was the ﬁrst college en-
counter to be played under the lights
of Ward field. About 2,000 spectators
saw the Pioneers score early in the
ﬁrst period, when Ruff and Douglas
hettered their way to the one yard
line and Thomas scored on an aerial
smash through center.

Outcome Ne'er in Doubt

These first few minutes proved
Crinnell's superiority, and although
outweighed nearly eight pounds to a
man, never was the outcome of the
game in doubt. Only once. that in the
second quarter. did the Wesleyan Ti-
gers threaten to score.

Grinnell‘s gains came as a result
of straight football and no opportun-
ity was afforded to witness the new
trick plays that the Pioneer mentor
has introduced this season.

Lateral Poss Scores

Crinnell began her second march
down the ﬁeld in the second quarter
when Uffelman. of Wesleyan. kicked
to Thomas who was downed on the
45 yard line. Then Hensley picked up
13 yards through right tackle, Ull-
rich crashed through guard for 10
more and Thomas circled left end for
a good 20 yards. With the hall lying
on the 12 yard line. a lateral pass

' from U'llrich to Thomas made pCSA
ﬁlms. the second score.

The ﬁnal tally came as a result of
a 25 yard gain around left end by
‘Captaiu Douglas; a beautiful 30 yard
pass. Ruff to Thomas, and a pivot
smash through center, Douglas carry-
ing the ball. for seven yards and a
touchdown.

Many Substitutions Made

Coach Watt substituted freely.
keeping his ﬁrst string men in con-
dition for the Marquette game, At
the middle of the third quarter
it was nearly a second team that op-
-posed the Wesleyan outﬁt.

A none too heavy line held up well
Saturday night and the backﬁeld got
'off to some fast starts. Thomas.
'Douglas, and Ruff were the hack-
’ﬁeld luminaries, while Humphrey and
'Norton were the strong spots of the
’I‘lne: Bradshaw, Parks. Uffelman. and
Benson were Wesleyan’s best bets.
