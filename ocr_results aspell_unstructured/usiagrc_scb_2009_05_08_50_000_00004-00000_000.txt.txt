“MMSC is continuing with its efforts to evaluate and treat
patients with symptoms ofthc H1N1 virus, in order to reduce
the spread of this new virus," schelling said in a press release
on Wednesday. ”Based on the CDC guidance released early on
Mays and the additional guidance from the Iowa Department
of Public Health, the Marshalltown schools have reopened."

The H1N1 virus behaves the same as the seasonal inﬂuenza
strands. inﬂuenza type A and B, except that it is resistant to
most types ofvaecines. The Center for Disease Control sug
gests using oselramivir or zanamivir, common Vaccmes {or the
seasonal strands of inﬂuenza, for treatment and prevention of

infection from the H1N1 virus

To prevent the virus from spreading. the MMSC has set
up a flu screening table at the entrance to the hospital Upon
entering the hospital. individuals must ﬁll out a suwcy explainr
ing their symptoms if it is discovered that an individual has a
temperature or 100 or more degrees, they are then directed to
go to the Emergency Room ﬂu center.

“It's been pretty stcady,"said Colby Cowan, a nursing assists
ing stationed at the ﬂu screening in the hospiral. “i haven'r had
to direct anyone to the ﬂu center."

Virus mutation is especially problemaric in the inﬂuenza
virus, since the H5N1 virus, or the bird ﬂu virus onOOSrZOOé,
spread as a result ofa genetic murarion hem earlier, less severe
strains. Mutation ofa strand can cause a virus to remain dor-V
mant for a few months and then ietiirn with inoie severe and
possibly deadly symptoms.

“[The screening process] is more precautionary we're more
worried about it mutating," said Jill Villalobos, director of
Medical Clinical Operations at MMSC, “Once the virus mu-
tates, it gains strength and gets woise.”

According to Father Jim Miller at st. Mary's Catholic
Church in Marshalltown, virus mutation is one of the biggest
concerns of the community members in Marshalltown

“lVlost people are worlied about [the virus] in the tall since
it takes four to six months for the virus to mutate,"Miller said,
“It could getworse."

Despite conceins of mutation, Miller said that the Swine
Flu has had Little impact on the church "We had a ﬁrst comr
munion and one of the [attendees] brothers had Swine Flu,"
Miller said. “I went to a store one evening. and one woman had
a mask on, but there wasn't much else"

Though health ofﬁcials are trying to keep the virus eonr
taincd. the repercussions have spilled into the Grinnell commur
nity, Walk a Mile in her Shoes, a DVA/SAC organized event,
was canceled on Sunday due to the outbreak of Swine Flu.

Walk a Mile in her Shoes organizers, susan l<lumpner '09
and Helen Bailey ’09, received the call from their supervisor on
Sunday morning, hours before the scheduled start time, that
the event was canceled.

“Swine Flu mined my life," Klumpner said. “This ms our
project, and all ofour hard work was gone in one morning.”

The virus has not come to campus, according to Deb Shill, a
staff nurse at the health center, and they don’t expect it to arrive.

“We’re keeping an eye on the students, but there’s really no
need for concern," Shill said.
