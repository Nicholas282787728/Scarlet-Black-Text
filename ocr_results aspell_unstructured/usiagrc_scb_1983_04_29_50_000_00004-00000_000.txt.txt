“Shopping for Images, Iwent into the
Neon Fruit Supermarket....”

Different people have talked of them in
diltei'ent ways, but I like Joan Didion's the
best. She writes about walking into one in
an old bikini bathing suit and having an
older woman scowl at her and say, “What
u thing to wear to the market." The
market, The grocery store The super-
lllul’kel.

From the childhood memories of getting
:i ride in the front seat 01‘ a shopping cart
\\'I!h my box at animal-shaped cookies, to
lile recent past (i.e., yesterday, while
grabbing a carton of cottage cheese from
the top shelf in the dairy section, a
siockhoy saying "Howdy"), the store
it here I go to purchase my food has been a
place of endearment. STOP and SHOP.
FOODTOWN. AKlP. While in junlDI‘ high
my mom and I cut out the coupons from
the weekly ilyer and gloated over the fact
lliat we could get the checkout person to
uccept coupons (or things we hadn't
bought, (To this day, [believe it is because
of us that there are those little sings at
.egisters all over the county which state,
"Please present coupons prior to checking
out "l STOCK UP AND SAVE. LIMIT
THREE PER CUSTOMER TWO FOR 75¢.

When I came to Grinnell, I was heart
broken because I was on board, which
meant no food shopping. Life became
monotonous. No more comparison shopp»
mg. No more searching for the latest dated
package of Swiss cheese. I grew listless. I
decuded life was not worth living if I
couldn't compare heads of cabbage for

freshness. Then I moved off campus and
since then have led a blissful existence.
For those of you who have signed leases to
apartments in nice, mandatory-shopping
places, i guarantee you your suicidal
tendencies will disappear when you begin
doing your own food shopping. And here I
present to you my biased opinion about
shopping in Grinnell.

McNally's: Avoid McNally's unless it is
a) very cold, bl Sunday, c) you want the
two pound container of yogurt which they
do not sell at i-‘areway. DO NOT (I repeat,
do not) purchase produce at McNally's it
is expensive, and I have heard rumors that
some of it is plastic.

But I must confess to you that there is
something quite luxurious about saunter»
ing into the most expensive food store in
Grinnell, an asset not to be
underestimated. To get the fullest satisfac-
tiiin from this occasion, i suggest doing it
late at night and in a black sequin dress
with Givenchy stockings (with mandatory
black seams up the back) and dangling
diamond earrings, Nonchalantly loss
items such as Stouffer's Chinese style
frozen vegetables and canned caviar
(don‘t forget Kal Kan for pet Fifi) into
your cart. Flirt with the stockboy and ask
him if he has read Flaubert. Mumble
things in French and at the checkout line
purchase every Iashion magazine they
sell. Complain that they do not carry Paris
Vogue. Hand the checkout clerk a crisp
$100 bill and tell him/her to kept he
change. Most impormntly. refuse to take

Anonymity

Dear John Doe,

. Question: What is the difference bet»

ween the walls of die Burling women‘s
. bathroom and die Scarlet and Black?

.Answer: At times, not much.

If this seems a hostile way to begin my
response to your article in the April 15
issue, then I’ll softenit by specifying that
my contention lies with only one aspect of
your "retrospective View".

Let's talk about graffiti 'and anonymity.
tit is not easy to be anonymous in a town
Grinnell's size or in a microcosm such as is
the College. It is difficult for me to write
this letter of response when in doing so I've
allowed anyone who reads this to know
something about me. Me, who never writes
to my class agent Ior fear of being quoted
_in the next newsletter (sorry, Abbi V truth
will out). .

But wouldn’t you agree that people in
general should take responsibility for their
actions, including their expressed opi»

. nions?

It really seems a shame that the people
who are writing anonymous drivel on the
bathroom walls at Burling cannot find a
less vandalisiic medium of expression —
The Scarlet and Black, for instance. And
why not sign one's name? Or if that is just

To the Editor:

Has anybody considered the issue of
grafﬁti in Hurling? We have searched past
issues of the Scarlet and Black as Well as
the Des Moilies Register, The New York
Times, Newsweek and The Farmers
Almanac for discussion of this burning
topic.

We‘believe that a concerned student
body cannot ignore this essential issue, We
demand that the Scarlet and Black take
notice and give this important topic its due
coverage, at the expense of all other less
germane concerns. Does it matter that

page 4 Scarlet and Black April 29, 1983

too threatening, direct the quotes to the
personals section. At least in the 5&3, it
will remain forever a part oi Hurling
Library.

Please explain to me also why graffiti
should be sanctioned or encouraged by the
staff, the administration, or the campus-
aHarge. These buildings do not belong to
the staff; neither do they belong to the
students attending Grinnell today to do
with as they please any more than they
belonged to me when I came to Grinnell )0
years ago.

This institution exists for those who
came before and those who will come after
as well as for the present student popula»
tion. Certainly, the administration, as
caretakers of the college, has the right to
make certain decisions regarding the
maintenance of these facilities without
consulting students and without students
feeling they have been robbed at a cherish-
ed moral right. This is particularly true if,
as in this case, it does not impede the ex—
pression of their opinions or beliefs,

No one needs a bathroom wall to voice
dissent at Grinnell, unless of course they
feel threatened enough to need anonymity,
But then, we have the 5&8 for that, eh,
John Doe? — Susan Bahrenfuse

nuclear weapons threaten our existence,
and apathy serves only to insure destruc-
tinn of life, liberty and justice for all?
N0 ' South Africa, after all, is thousands
and thousands of miles away whereas
Burllng bathroom is right next door We
must preserve our liberal pieces (or
peaces) of mind, So editor, does not your
civic responsibility dictate that you give
more coverage to this paramount concern
or all Grinncll students past, present and

your sweepstakes ticket With exception to

Fareway: Fareway is the kind of place
that makes you feel like maybe it wasn't
such a stupid idea to come to Iowa in the
first place. Upon entering, one is imr
mediately under the impression that
something wonderful is about to happen.
And the customer who feels this way is core
rect, because the first thing he/she ens
counters upon entering is the produce seer
tion. Here one has the pleasure of either
picking ones apples individually or pur-
chasing them in prepackaged bags. In this
indoor Garden of Eden, the carrots are
fresh, the avocados are marked 29t with
bright orange labels, and one is overcome
by the realization that American is an in-
credible, amazing country bringing
vegetables across thuusands of miles to sit
on shelves for all of us to accept or reject,
depending on our whim tnnd if one is feel-
ing at all political, this realization is
followed by fifteen minutes of utter depres-
SlOn concerning the starving children in In

Dairy Barn and the kind of energy it mikes
so that we can have lettuce that isn't

Also a good place to pick up the latest

about'getting the corn in.”)

Other assets: the stockboys are friendly,
they have regular specials on popcorn, and
the checkout women call out each price in
a glorious monotone that simply cannot be
imitated.

Jerry's By-Lo: I have only been here
once so I don't think it's fair to give a
rating. However, I do remember that
although they have specials, they also
have high prices, it you are leeling
nostalgic for the old green stamp days.
then this is the place for you. Though far~
ther away than either McNally's or
rareway, it also brings you that much
closer to Dairy Queen.

Hy<Vee: Anyone who would walk a mile
for a bag of groceries has got to he a little
crazy, but some of us do have cars, and so
Grinnell has given us l-ly-Vee. Heree is a
sort of fun place to go because they have a
deli and a bakery and even places to sit
down and eat They also have lots of
specxals on things like canned tomato soup
and giant bottles of soda pop. But for the
simple reason that I do not get into long
johns or potato salad, I iind no reason to
frequent Hy-Vee, Onc asset, however, is
that behind Hy-Vee there is a Salvation Arr
