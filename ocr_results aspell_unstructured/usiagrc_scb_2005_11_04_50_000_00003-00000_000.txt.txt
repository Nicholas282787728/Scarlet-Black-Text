Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory (PG)

Tim Biilton's C/Im'll'c and 1/12 Chow/arc Far/my is
an excellent remake of the 705 Willy Wont/I and [lit
C/Jﬂl'ﬂ/tI/L' Fin/Dry, based on the classic book wlitten
by Roald Dathhe new version does not attempt ro
resemble the original film but rather creates its own
unique setting and redefines its main characters. The
plot remains rly the same: the poor Challie Bucket
ﬁnds a golden ticket and is invited, along with four
other children, to tour Win “lonka's enchanting
chocolate factory.

There are, however, a few differences that distln’
guish this movie from rhe previous one. we all re-
member the little singing OompdeLoonlpn workers
ofthe original movie, which in this case are being re
placed by multiple computer-generated duplications
ofthe same tiny person. The music has also changed
considerably, from one basic song sirng by the “origi-
mil" Oomprrloompas to a broader variety of musical
styles, giving the ﬁlm a more contemporary twist.
Also the new version further develops the ﬁve kids
who win the desired Golden Tickets, especially the
character of Violet, the gumechewer.

johnny Depp does an outstanding job playing the
character of Willy Wonka. He brings a special com~
brnation of sarcasm and comedy to this role, sustain»
ing the audience’s faselnation and curiosity. Unlike
the charismatically eccentric Willy Wonka played
by Gene Wilder in the original ﬁlm, Johnny Depp’s
imaginative interpretation or the “God ofChocolate"
makes his character the main focus of this remake.
Under the brilliant direction of Trrn Burton, Depp
gives depth as well as personal history to a charac-
ter that was once perceived as OIlETdIn‘IBI‘ISIOHHl and
almost too mysterious. Burton succeeds, yet again, to
create a magical world that is visually breathtaking in
addition to being enriched with emotional value.

The movie is an enjoyable celebration of child
hood, innocence and SUGAR, and therefore I strange
ly recommend replacing the traditional popcorn with
significant amounts of chocolate! You won't regret
coming prepared.

Me and You and Everyone We
Know (R)

Like many independent ﬁlms, Mr and You and
Ewryime I’V: Kim-w fails to fall into any one Hollye
wood category. One part romantic comedy, one part
coming-ofeage talc and one part examination ofthe
human condition. this award winning film (at both
Cannes and Sundance) is a revealing, wondrous and
somewhat surreal take on the connections between
people both young and old.

Hustle and Flow smart/ct 1/1: Iyo rye pimp who dreams of/mt'uming 11 rapper,

At the center of ME and You mid Ewiymle We
Know is the relationship between struggling multi-
media artist Christinc (Miranda Jilly) and recently
divorced shoe salesman Richard (John Hawkcs). A
chance meeting in Richard’s shoe store gradually
leads to a quirky and touching romance, and the two
characters share a palpable, however offbeat, chemiSe
try. However, their relationship is just one of the many
that populate the ﬁlm.

Richard has two sons, 14eyear~old Peter (Miles
Thompson) and 7eyeareold Robbie (an amazing
performance by Brandon Ratcliff) with whom he
shares a relationship rhat is far from traditional. Pe-
ter is learning to explore his sexuality with two older
neighborhood girls, although he seems to have a
greater connection with a younger girl Sylvie (Carlie
Wcsrennan) who is preoccupied with preparing for
her future. Meanwhile. Robbie turns to the computer
fol friendship and, in one particularly disconcerting
scene, has cyber sex with an unseen older woman,

While this summary may seem off-putting, espe-
cially in regards to the portrayal of children’s sexuality,
it is a testament to rhe power of Miranda July's (who
also wrote and directed the film) vision and atmoe
spheric control at the ﬁlm remains weightless and
dreamily inquisi ve. As a successful performance MP
ist making her ﬁrst full-length ﬁlm, Mrs. Jilly brings
a unique perspective to the medium; Me midi/1m and
Ewclyoll: W: Klww's “Originality ofVision” — the title
of the award it won at the 2005 Sundance Film Festi-
val — makes it well worth seeing.

However, along with any ﬁlm driven by “tone” and
“vision", if the director’s sensibilities do not match
your own, the film's cohesion and brilliance can diSe
appear quickly. That said, Mr and You and Eonyorrc
Wr Know is an original piece of movie making and, in
my estimation, is well worth the risk. '

Snotty children, an ambitious pimp

Pimp my ChOCOIate factory: and offbeat relationships take the

silver screen this weekend

CoukTEsv mmwuoocoiw

Hustle and Flow (

The plot orHrot/r mu] Flaw focuses on a pimp
from Memphis reaching for his dreams in spite ofh'ls
situation. Djay (Terrance Howard) has grown weary
of his present way of life. He is pushing 40 and has
never met his early aspirations to be a rap star. Instead
he has become a street hustler and a IOWeend pimp, a
profession not deserving of his talent or time.

When a chance meeting piovides him with an
opportunity to cut a few tracks, DIay uses his streete
hustling skills to try and got himself noticed by an
established rap star (played by Ludacris).

Director Craig Brewer had problems in selling
his script because otthe color orhis skin: white. But
when acclaimed director John Singleton (Boyz in air
Hood) read the script, he attached his name to the
project, and the ﬁlm rook oft Subsequently the ﬁlm
won the audience award at sundance and was bought
by MTV ﬁlms.

This is not a typical “MTV hipehop film" with
a popular rapper as the lead. Terrance Howard gives
a serious performance as the ambitious Pimp/MC
play, and supporting actors Anthony Anderson and
Taryn Manning give the best performances of their
careetsr Hull]: and Flow is not a film to be dismissed
easily, While it deals with the life of a pimp, it does
not gloiify or condemn that lifestyle. Craig Brewer IS
a filmmaker who can present a controversial subject in
a way that satisfies his audience.

As Djay said, “it’s not the size of the dog in the
ﬁght, but the size of the ﬁght in the dog," this ﬁlm,
a small, low-budget production, is one of the ﬁnest
films released this year. Hurt]: and Flow is for those
who like it ﬁlm that will make you think, but is also
incredibly enjoyable.
