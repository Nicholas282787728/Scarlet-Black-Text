fililack religion: history of struggle

ii there is no struggle, there is no pro
gress, Those who profess to iavor
freedom, and yet depreciate agitation,

: are men who want crops without plow-

' ing up the ground. They want rain
without thunder and lightning , . . This
struggle may he a mural one, or it
may be a physical one; or it may be
both moral and physical; but there
must be a struggle—Frederick

. Douglass

. The Negro church developed out of a

~ vicious cycle of racism; its history is
interwoven with the experiences oi
both black and white Americans, The
Church was the means by which
former slaves expressed their yearn-
ing [or liberation The Concerned
Black Students at Grinnell College
wish_to iniorm the campus community
of thc history and significance of the
black man’s quest for identity through

- religious instruction.

Religious training and instruction
was seen by the planter class as being
necessary for the proper seasoning ot
the slave. The master would give the
slave some of his Christianity and
forever rid himself of the thought that
these bondsmen would dare break
from their cages of captivity. Such
was the plan. But like all great plans
it had a flaw. The slave did indeed at-
tend the church services which the
master so conveniently arrangedibut
he did not internalize the points of
view oiten resounded irom the pulpit.
The slave had a mind of his own just
as he had a culture of his own. These
ebony creatures merely accomodated
to the slave regime, they did not
become completely assimilated or ac-
culturated. White ministers who
taught Such platitudes as that the soul
was free and the body was to be sub-
jugated, accomplished little it their
task was to convince the slave to wait
[or- his liberation in the “by and by”
or in the sky. The slave was aware or
Heaven but could not envision spen-
ding sixty years on a plantation
waiting to meet his day of rest in the
sheet oi blue suspended in the air.

What would often occur after the
religious sermon the master had
prepared was this: several slaves
would gather somewhere on or near
the plantation and hold a secret
prayer meeting. They would sit
around and listen intently to one oi
their own and sing songs like “Oh,
Freedom," and repeat passages irom
a Bible that spoke of Moses telling
Pharoah to let those Hebrew chillun
go. This was pure genius on the part
or nose slaves who were supposed to
be dumb, lazy and shittless. And when
the: meeting was over the slaves would

return to their cabins and say a
prayer to God thanking him ior
another day of lifeibut always think-
ing of freedom, “Oh, Freedom!"

When foreigners came to America
and visited the plantations and saw
those large black bodies in the lields
pulling their weight with tremendous
pull and gravity and heard these
slaves sing triumphantly, they im~
mediately wrote in their journals that
these displaced Children of Cain were
content with their lots in life, These
foreigners did not understand that the
slave songs were protest—tights and
battles of pending liberation. Not all of
the spirituals were otherwordly and
compensatory The slave song had a
language oi its own that did not
square with that of the planter south.
when slaves sang “Like a tree planted
by the river, I shall not be moved” the
master just smiled and payed that‘
ridiculous and servile child little
“mind," The master-class could not
conceive of a black Moses goin’ down
into Egypt to liberate his people, But
where the master could not imagine a
black Messiah, the bondsmen did. I
can assure you the planters in
Virginia were shocked by the news oi
Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey, and
Gabriel Presser.

Slaves were not stupid; they were
cunning. After they had had a night of
repose, they would go back into the
held the next morning and sing
“Joshua iit de Battle of Jericho." The
master and the overseer peered down
on these helpless ol’ souls and thought
to themselves how successful the
seasoning process had been.

Now, the slaves had to be very
careful about singing those songs.
They would devise special codes to
signiiy when the mastah was acomin’;
but when he passed they would con-
tinue to chant: “l’m GDln' to Lay

Down My Life for My Lord." “white
power may have persuaded some to
be passive and accept the present
reality oi seridom, but generally when
slaves sung oi heaven, it was because
they realized the futility of rebellion
and not because they accepted
slavery."

I have told you so far how the slave
was cunning and how he went un-
suspected by his superiors. Now, lam
going to tell you how the slave used
the religion of the Mastah to fashion
his own conception of what Christiani-
ty ought to bet

Several states in the South had laws
that precluded blacks l‘rom minister-
ing. You see, those big and tough
Overseers were, to tell nothing but the
truth, airaid oi those nigger
preachers But this did not stop the
more resourceful bondsman from
devising some type oi plan to get to
know his Maker. The slave community
often times would sit around on Sun-
day and tell some stories about how
the small animal ate up the big, bad
lion. They would laugh and shout—and
the master from time to time got his.
