No secret here: women’s soccer ready to repeat

By Andrew Sherburne

we ar rhe S&B sporrs depart-
menr smrr oneacb new yenr by pre.
Vlcwlng Grinnell's rall sporrs reams.
So, with rhar in mind, I'd like ro
roll you all abour rhc 2000 women's
soccer team, The only problem is
rliar i can’r rell you roo much.

I iricel ro wresrle our all the de-
tails from Coach Heather Banning,
bur she's a rough summer and
wouldn’t give away any seerers, lesr
rho Pioneers’ opponenrs mighr
learn “me much." Maybe when her
eosehing days are over she can work
seeuriry ror l'orr Knox or rhe Aead.
emy Awards.

Nor rhor she’ll be looking for a
new job anyrime soon. Grinnell's
opponenrs discovered her “scorer"
lasr year when rho Pioneers wenr
undefeared in rlic Midwest Confer
ence to claim rhe crown and ad-
vance ro rhe Division Ill playofrs.

This year should be no differs
cm. Grinnell returns the core oflasr
year's players, including ream Cap»
rains Sarah Dixon ’01 and Liz Grail
'01, as well as NCAA»Dileion III
scoring champ Amy walrers ’01.

“All or rhe rerurning players
have come back srronger rhan ever,"
said Dixon. “Wehave asolid group
or experienced players who will
eonrnbure grearly rd our success,"

hungry group oiwemen. who eaeh

Laid before rhese “hungry
women" is a virrual buffer ofcon»
rerenee opponenrs. However, rhe
Pioneers wlll have re be careiiil nor
ro ﬁll up on eupeakes and save room
for rhe main course.

“In eonrerence, Lawrence and

Sr. Norberr ivill be our roughesr
competition," explained Walrers.
Bur penning is quick ro add rhnr
“the conference is rough across rhe
board and we cam overlook any
out."
Like
women's sporrs over rhe pasr de.
eade, play has beeorne much more
eornpeiidve, and soccer is no excep-
rion. silll, while the Pioneers raced
some rough eomperidon lasr year,
rhey clearly dominared rhe confer—
ence in rhe orrsenson. The incom»
ing erop orrirsr.years is a rcsrimos
nial ro rhe quality errhe program,
and can only help to srrengrhen an
already excellent ream.

Aerually, I was yoiirsporrs edi-
ror lasr year, (00. Before rhar, I was
a sporrs wrirer here ar rhe S&B.
And even berore rhar, when 1 was
in high school, 1 worked for my
homerown newspaper (in

We er rheS&B aresrriving ro make

goal, we've had ro make some
changes in rhe paper, and rlre sporrs

You‘ve probably already noriced
some changes ro rhe sporrs secrion.
Gone is rhe “This week in sporrs"

The hard parr or rhis year is
going ro be deciding jusr which 35*
peers or Criniiell arhlerier will be
fenriirtd. The 20004001 year is
shopiug up ro be one orrhe besr in
