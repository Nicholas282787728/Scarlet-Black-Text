Shattered windows,
broken bicycles

EV MAC POHANKA

over the past week, campus has again seen a boom
in vandalism, including more broken windows and
mangled student bikes.

on Saturday night or Sunday morning, a window
in the South campus loggia near Quad vim: broken,
and an office in Cowles had its screen cut and was but-
glnrized.The vandal riﬂed through the office and stole
money. This weekend there were also six large Harris
windows broken, possibly by a BB
or pellet gum, according to Director
of Security Steve Briscoe, who said
that the police were called to come
in and look at the nearly $4,000
in damage. Small bullet-like holes
were found in the glass.

Briscoe said that another burr
glaly of a considerable sum or
money from Harris was recently
reported, though he said he wasn’t sure when the bnr~
glary ocurred.

Student bicycles were also vandalized. Sophomore
Adam Brumers bike was stolen sometime Friday night
and then found Saturday morning by Biumer with two
bent wheels, a broken chain and twisted handlebars.

Dale Mackey ‘07, who had lier scooter broken,
wrote in an email to the 5811’. “I was walking home on
Saturday night around 4 am, and there were a ton of
bikes strewn all over Cleveland beach, My poor little

oﬁf”

Spring initiatives
It’s time for that bl-annual ritual of

self~governance, as well as SPARC elec»
tions and SGA cabinet selections

Voting for tlrrs sprrng’s round of student rnrtratrves will take
place next Thursday, April 21, along with Student Publications and
Radio Committee (SPARC) elections,

Statements ofintcnt for SPARC candidates are due on Tuesday,
and applications for next year’s SGA cabinet are due today, Cabinet
members are selected by next year’s Presrdent and VP and approved
by rlris yoni": Joint Board.

Bucksbaum availability

We believe that Bucksbanm Center for the Arts should have at
least one external door equipped with a Prcnrd reader. This would
allow students 24rhour access to the resources unique to the build

I want laundry to be rolled into the comprehensive fee. To ac
count for the current pAyﬂs-yotkgo revenue, there will be a one—
time increase of 565 in the comprehensive fee. surdents residing
in residence halls and OCCO houses would receive 75 loads per
semester. —Mar/ Cleinmmi '06

Dealing with marijuana

RLCs and other Student Affairs staff should not call Security
ror seeing or smelling marijuana without first trying to solve rhe sit-
uation directly with the student or students themselves unless safety
demands otherwise. 75m Mil/lurid» ‘05 and Pam Clougb ‘06

scooter was laying on its side in the middle orrhe side-

walk and part of it was cracked off." A stereo left on

Cleveland beach was also destroyed Saturday night,
Campus bikes have not faced much serious vandalr

”My poor little stooter was laying
on ll: side in the middle ofllle
sidewalk and part old was (racked

ism since the first weekotthe program,when a bike was
thrown off of the loggia, leaving it with a bent wheel
and n cmcked frame,said Student Services Coordinator
Drew Blackman. Blackman said that the large number
of bikes needing repairs may be due to students “being
rough with rhern and not treating
them as well as they would if they
were their own."

on Wednesday night, two
North campus loggia windows
near Clark and Dibble were
smashed. According to Btiscoe,
someone heard the breaking glass
and called Security but when secur
rlry arrived there was no one at the
scene. Brisco Said that the windows “look like someone
just busted them out," though he didn't know how.

According to Briscoe, the police often see similar
damage in town For example it turned out that when
a cnrwas broken into on campus earlier this year there
were also several cars in town broken into as well.

Briscoe asked students to report damage and Van»
dalism us soon as they see it so that Security will be able
to respond and uninvolved students in dorms will not
have to pay ﬁnes {or the damage.
