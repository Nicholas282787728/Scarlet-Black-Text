Notes on
Collegiate World

Ohio's Governor Martin L. Da-
vey was not called upon to give the
shirt off his back, but he was re-
quested to give up a pair of shorts.
This is the story in brief:

As an iiutiatlon sLunL, Charles
A. Ferllald, Ohio state university
senior, was ordered by his Delta
thpa Epsilon brothers, to ohtaiu
an autographed pair of Governor
Davey's shorts,

Fenlald telephoned to find out
the governor's size; then he bought
a pair, called at the executive’s ofr
fices, and proposed a swap.

Governor Davey consented, went
into a side office. and, a few min-
utes later, presented Fer-nald wrth
the autographed shorts.

Senior women students at Penn»
sylvania State college have agreed
that marriage and a career cannot
be comhined successfully

An overwhelming majority of
the 190 girls that took part in the
poll declared that a career after
marriage is not fair to the husband
nor to needy single girls who are
out of work.

“The Maierl'der Ghost” has
talked at lastiafter a million
words of his themes and term top-
ics have been graded under the
names of a score of paying student
clients,

John Galvin, graduate student in
history at Columbia university, he-

gan his ”ghosting-career" in high‘

.school when lazy lads paid him a
quarter to write each of their 300'
Word themes.

When he came to Columbia in
1932 and his many clients enrolled
at Yale, Harvard, Fordham and
Randolph-Macon, he had to extend
his tailorvmade theme service. The
old patrons recommended him to
others, and soon he had a prosper-
ous mail-order business.

After more than four years of
hard “ghosting" under others'
names, Galvin has released himself
from his careful anonymity and
has become himself once again.

Phil Dessauer, acolumnist at
Oklahoma City university, recent-
ly called attention to the need of
new typewriters for student use
by classifying the old machines in
the following manner:

“The common type' is known as
the ‘Hawaiian' or ‘Hula model! It
shimmies. Number two is the
“Love-bird type,‘ Every part is
stuck on some other part, and the
keys are stuck on themselves.

“The ‘Hop-skipeand-jump’ varie-
ty is the Jesse Owens of its regs
iment. It always goes twice as
fast as the typist.

”Number four is the ‘Journal-
ist‘s Special,‘ It is nature's great
boon to the lead pencil industry
A sort of aviatoretype machine.
'The keys always look over the
field before they land.

"The last model is known as the
Secretary! It slips into your lap
atthe slrghtets provocation.”

U. S. Senator Gerald P. Nye says

“I enjoy the comfort a light smoke

"I have smoked Luckies off and an ever
since my ﬁrst term in the Senate 11 years

ago, and I have

always enjoyed their

taste and the feeling of comfort and
safety a light smoke gives my throat. I
have done a great deal of public speak-
ing, on the ﬂoor of the Senate, never the
radio and at conferences. Necessarily
this results in a strain on the voice. So
naturally, in smoking, 1 have to think
of my throat—and l have found that a
light smoke is suitable to my throat.”

U. S. SENATOR

In a recent independent survey, an over—
whelming majority of lawyers, doctors, lecturers,
scientists, etc., who said they smoked cigarettes, ex-
pressed their personal preference for alight smoke.

Senator Nye’s statement veriﬁes the wisdom
of this preference and so do leading artists of
radio, stage, screen and opera, whose voices are
their fortunes, and who choose Luckies, a light
smoke. You, too, can have the throat protection
of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain harsh

irritants removed by the exclusive process “It’s
Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on your throat.
