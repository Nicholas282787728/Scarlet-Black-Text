Bluestone warns on economy

ByTara Neavins

The United States is lagging
dangerouslybehind its competitors,
argued IrvingBluestone, the former
vice-president of the United Auto
Workers, inaspecch Wednesday in
South Lounge.

Bluestone, currently Professor
of Labor Studies at Wayne State
University in Detroit, has been on
campus all of this weck as the
Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow.

Bluestoneasserted in his speech
thatglobal competition has become
“keenerandkeener”inrecentycars.
To improve American competi»
tiveness, he said that the US. must
recognize its“supetiorimponartce"
and build a national industrial
policy, reallocating tax dollars to
repair the infrastructure and to con-
centrate on domestic issues, while
cutting military spending.

He warned that in the long nln
"the American people vote not so
much on the international scene as
on the domestic scene," and that the
govemmentmustattend to the weir
fare of its own people. The impor-
tancc of investing in research and
development of new products was
also emphasized by Bluestone. The
lackofsuchresearch andtth.S.’s
“Wall-Street“ notion of immediate
proﬁt have, he argued, coupled to

notably agriculture.

He added that Ameri-
cans must abandon the no-
tion ofhaving“govcmment
off our backs and every-
thing left to the entreprce
neurs.“ and must recognize
the importance of estab-
lishingmarkctsharcsinkcy
industries, rather than sim-

He explained that this abil-

ity has been crucial to J apnn‘s suc-
cess, particularly in regard to their
capture of the small-car industry
when the U.S. continued to
manufacture large cars since they
provided a much higher short term
profit.

Bluestone noted the great diffi-
culty he and others had in generat-
ingmanufacturers‘ interestforsmall
cars after the 1940's. Particularly
troubling to some, he said, was the
idea that “we are not going to have
a profit for about five years."

cemed with employee satisfaction,
full employment, and quality pro-
duction, than with “the fast buck."
Here, the union and management
collaborated to decide the pricethat
would be charged for the car, and
other aspects of the program. The
result was a car of vastly superior
quality to that of GM’s American
rivals.

If the U.S. can adopt such a
conceptionof industry and research.
then a productivity slow-down “is
not inevitable,” said Bluestone.
Otherwise, the U.S. could weaken
dramatically, he said, and future
generations “will not have the same
standard of living that my wife and
I enjoy,"

Jewish heritage in
Iowa researched

By Tara Neavins

Michael Bell. an associate pro-
fessor of American studies, and his
colleague Hanna Griff, are now re-
searching Jewish culture ill Iowa.
The project, which includes Grin-
nell students, covers the history of
Jewish settlement in the state.

Jews first came to Iowa in the
1830’s. By l900,around30001ews
settled here.. Bell said that they
followed Reformed Judaism and
thus assimilated well into the Iowa
culture. A further inﬂux early this
century raised the number to 9000
by 1914,

Tthews who moved to Iowa at
the turn of the century were Or-
thodox, unlike the 19th Century
Jewish immigrants “Many of the
new Jews felt alienated, and there
was a lot of strife between the two
groups." said Bell.

This strife was overcome by
establishing settlement houses and
formingathleticand otherclubs not
connected to the synagogues. Jews

tended to settle in small, "self~cone .

Iained towns" and sought interace
tion through such settlement houses
by no longer “being bounded” to
their individual towns.

They also set up “circuits" via
which “whole families would go to
Des Moines and spend time with
other Jewish families." The intent
of the circuits, Bell explained, was
for unity, preservation of heritage.
and future marital considerations.

Project research has focused on
women’s records of Jewish life
since “women have a much better
record of the daily, often mundane
aspects of Jewish life," said Bell.
Within Jewish history, women are
given “as much prominence" as

men in the history through discus
sion of “parties, holiday festivals.
and schools." As a result of incor-
porating perspectives of both sexes
into Jewish history, we have a
“much nicer and fuller picture of
what the actual as opposed to the
institutional life of the community
was like,“ said Bell.

Jews originally came to Iowa as
part of the westward migration.
Those who came to Iowa later,
however, ﬂed east coast ovcre
cmwding,aresultof vicious perse-
cution they had encountered under
the pogroms in Russia.

Thelewish Agricultural Society
also encouraged Jews to become
farmers and move to the Midwest
This group, from Galveston, Texas
concenuated on those Jews arriv-
ing by ship in the South. Finally,
families under the direction of the
Industrial Removal Office moved
to the Midwest wherejobs were far
more accessible.

Bell stated that approximately
15,000 Jews lived in Iowa in the
1950‘s. Currently, there are about
5700. Bell gave severalreasons for
this tremendous decline in popula-
tion. lowa has experienced an un-
usual and dramatic decline in popue
lation in recent years. Also college
graduates, of whom Jews form a
higherthannveiageproporuon,rehd
to be more likely to leave the state.

In Bell's view, Jews have rarely
left Iowa due to discrimination.
There is “no more and perhaps a
little less ovcrt discrimination in
Iowa“ than elsewhere, said Bell. “1
genuinely compliment Iowans.
They are among the most polite
people I have ever met. By being
polite,thcylendnottotellyouwhat
they think," he added.
