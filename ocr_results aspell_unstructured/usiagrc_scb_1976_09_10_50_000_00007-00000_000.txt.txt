who has periormed this iunction
for the College for sixteen years.

The restructuring telescopes the
jobs of Dentel and McCluskey and
Latimer into one post. This new
posotion was offered to and ass
cepted by Latimer,

Criticism by the Grinnell
community of the move centers in
two areas- a.) decisions affecting
student services were made enr
tirely without consultation of the

nts (or faculty) and b.) that in

y ways the decisions made
were poor in and cl themselves. A
committee formed by the SGA to
stgdy the reorganization has
uteri both these complaints and
intends to hold an open forum Sept
23 at 7:30 in South Lounge to
discuss the changes.

President Turner’s defense of
the administration's lack Inf
student or iaculty input into the
matter is that as long as the
College provides the students with
a service of a given quality, how
that service is provided is not a
student concern He cites the new
tood service as an example. “II the
college can find a way to provide a
more economical lood program to
lh students, it is a strictly adr
i istrative decision as to whether
or not we do that. it only becomes a
student question if the service
suffers as a result " He feels in

Members of the Grinnell Cans
certs Committee have expressed
“grave misgivings” about the
future of the concert and film
programs of the school Without
Ms. Dentel's expertise and
assistance (See Open Space).

Likewise, members of the
Grinnell Outdoor Recreation
Program are worried that the
outing program might well be
nonexistent next year, Ms Mc-
Cluskey presently devotes most oi
her day to the sports curriculum
and spends many evenings, as well
as weekends, to the organization of
outdoor recreation and conducting
workshops in the skills associated
with' these activities. One of
Turner’s jusliflcalions for cutting
McClusky's posotiun is based on
his observation of Middlebury’s
outdoor recreation program which
utilizes student volunteers.

However, a GORP represen-
tallve who has spent some time at
Middlehury was quick to point out
that “Mlddlebury is surrounded by
excellent hiking areas Many oi the
students there are from that part of
the country where this sort ct
activity is more popular and thus
the skills more commonly known,
They've even got their own ski
slope.” They thus despair that
Since many incoming students are
from midwestern areas where
these hobbies are not as popular as
in the East, they will be deprived of
the necessary training needed to
participate in these activities. As
iull time students, can? members
do not‘forsee having the time to
organize andvconduct adequate
workshops to maintain the
program at a level near that of the
present time.

Saga's disappearance and the
arrival of Grinnell‘s privately run

enough confusion to warrant
labeling the present set-up FOG

how my head leeis alter the first

with Dave McConnell, director of
Grinnell’s Food Service. Im~
mediately alter sitting down with
Dave I was zapped with a belt of
instant energy and enthusiasm
which pried my eyes open and
pinned my ears back. Dave‘s zeal
for his Job is evident. He shoots
suggestions, recipes, changes,
dreams and ideology within the
space oi one sentence. Usually i
would treat skeptically the
statement, ”I spend 13 hours a day,
7 days a week of enjoyment here. it
my job were work, i wouldn’t be
here [am not here because i have
to be here, but becaust I want to be
here,” but coming from Dave, 1
just had to believe it. His fresh
input into the lood program is
immeasurable.

After waking me up (which is an
accomplishment in itself), I was
impressed by Dave's opposing
qualities of calmness and per-
fectionlsm He Carefully and
quietly explained some of the
massive problems inherent in
feeding one thousand different
people, Problems are not seen as
setbacks but as an opportunity to
learn how to perlorm better and
bring a more beneficial eating
environment to the student body.
Dave has set the modest goal of
having a “showcase food service7
one of the finest in the Midwest”
within the next three years. He will
not be satisfied with anything less,
If that goal is at all possible, the
person to accomplish it seems to be
here at Grinnell now.

The dining hall is a major part or
the boarding student's life at
school. Dave hopes to make the
eating and socializing experience
as pleasant as possible While
admitting that the format for
leeding people is diiiicult to
drastically change, a change in
personality. energy and en
thusiasm can change the at-
mosphere entirely This, a
privately run lood service has the
advantage of more spending
diversity and restaurant ex
perience, with a more direct
communication link between
students and the people in charge.

McConnell's plans and dreams
are enormous, He urges students
who' care about what they eat to
stop and talk to him He Will
provide more perspec ive oi the
Fog than this article possibly can
After all, don’t those health food
freaks say, “We are what we eat?"
