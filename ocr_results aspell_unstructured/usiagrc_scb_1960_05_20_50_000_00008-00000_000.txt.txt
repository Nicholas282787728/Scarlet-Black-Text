By some strange quirk of fate.
the results of the 1960 IM track
meet have momentarily disap-
peared. so i am forced to rcsci
my comments to the fact that
North won. Rawson finished sec—
ond and Cowles was a distant
third.

Charlie Turner led the North

softball throw. ether individual
performances and the i m ndcr

in contrast, I do feel quite
competent to discuss the recent

have all the data right at hand.

scores were considerably im—

structed lM softball tournamcnt
by virtue of a 12-4 defeat over
heavily favored Rawson.

The game was well played
defensively with a minimum of
errors and a number oi spark-
ling plays by both sides.

Dibble smashed Clark. 10.4, to
take the third slot and move
Clark into fourth, The consolation
round to determine the bottom
five places has yet to be played.

This brings us to analysis of

the Kent Trophy situation. \Vhich‘

has sudderly become quite Com-

Langan staff of statisticians I
will present its conclusions.

If North or Cowles win their
two remaining softball games,
they will finish in fiftli place

Looking Ai Sports

by .Dale Furnish

There are two means [or an athlete to excel. The first is

gltilat he be born with enough Godrgivcn natural ability that he
i can be good at any athletic Ieat.

His hady and mind are by nature constructed for quick
notion, last reflexes and What is usually called “sixth sense"—
the almost uncanny ability to (lo the right thing at the right
time in iill Situations.

The second means, and the one which is more often the
case at this school, is that the man starts with a lesser amount
of natural ability and builds on it, training himself until he is
good at a thing because he makes himself good at it.

This system Works wall. and Grlnnell’s fine overall record in
athletics down through the years attests to that fact. but there
can be problems. Wlth a small nucleus of natural athletes. Grin—

‘ liell has to rely on the “made” athlete in almost every sport.

The recruiting program here, such as it is. must go after the
bright boy who has n fine , holastic record and can pull the
load uondmnicniiy once he is in school.

Unfortunately, in a inaioritv of cases, that boy will not be the
outstanding athlcte in his school but a front—line reserve or see-
‘onzlary star.

When the athlete arrives at Grinnell he is faced with the
iproblem of readiusting 11' whole daily routine, as is every stu~
ident. He must study more stay up much later :ll_1(l subject him-
.scllt (10 a day to day grind he probably didn’t visualize in high
‘SCIOO.

E Faced with that situation the natural tendency is to let
i down—to only think about athletics during the two or three
l hours a day he is practicing or playing.

. if the an is concentrating on improving himself. working
.hard to make an already satisfactory performance better or to
gain a first Strin! spot. through the practice he puts in he can gem.
orally become a valuable and winning performer. In other words,
lhr is all right as long as he stays relaxed and does the job.

1 When things go wrong, 'Lhough. the athlete begins to press.
He realizes there is something wrong and, without the leisure
itiiiie to figure the situation out rationally and objectively, he
crams his woi- , into the practice and game sessions—the time
.when he should be doing things he has thought about before. The
thought becomes, simply “I've got to do it,” instead of “This is
what I'm doing wrong and this IS the way i can get back on the
right track” '

 

‘Anoiher thing an athlete is prone to at this school is slip-
ping into the rid of mediocnty. As long as the team wins most
of the time and the individual performs well the game is fun
and interesting and fulfilling. but heartbreaking losses or a run.
of bad luL mav cause the interest to slide. in the helter shelter
college tepce, it’s easier to devote the time elsewhere thali‘
to spend it on a lost cause, to exert even greater energy and
regain the level of success. Just going through the motions is
enough.

In the face of this. is the athletic program worthwhile7 it
is more worthwhile. for if the coach and his athletes can defeat
‘tlic aforementioned obstacles on the way to a successful season they
have done far more than they would have if athletics was the
only thing the, had to worry about. The winning teams, the
teams that retain their spiiit all year long. and 'almost every
athlete on the campus is doing a job for above the average stu—
dent‘s realization.
