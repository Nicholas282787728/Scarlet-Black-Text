Exercising

the Pentagon

Most Americans have paid as much attention to President
Ford’s Clemency Program as they did to the first casualty
figures from Vietnam in 1964, which wasn't much. Yet the
clemency program, which was to expire today, will probably be
extended, due to, the Government claims, a rush of applications
at the end. Still, few outside of the government are willing to
call it a success.

Since early August of 1964, the Pentagon has been plagued
by a demon of sorts, the demon being thousands of young men
who refused to fight in the Vietnam conﬂict. Operation Open
Door was an attempt to bring these men back into society
through an ”Earned ReAEntry" program. But as of late, the
Clemency Board has gone to desperate measures to try to at»
tract eligible resisters, deserters and veterans to its front steps.

Earlier this month, the Board began requesting public service
television and radio time in hopes of fostering more interest. It
is ignorance of the amnesty program, the government claims,
which has accounted for the low number of those turning
themselves in. Response indeed has been low.

of the three agencies handling the cases, the Clemency
Board, which handled convicted and punished civilian and
military cases, had 890 applications, with 65 grants of clemency,
out of a potential 100,000 applications, at the end of the first
week of January. The Justice Department, which handled
unsettled civilian draft evasion cases, had only 167 settlements
out of a possible 6,300. The third agency, the Defense Depart»
ment, which handled only unsettled military desertions and
AWOL cases, reported 627 settlements out of 2,500 known
fugitive deserters.

The reason for this is simple. The vast majority of those
eligible for clemency do not feel the need to admit that they are
wrong in the eyes of the government. What they did, in most
cases, they did consciously, and they view any ”clemency”
program, short of unconditional amnesty, as a penalty rather
than clemency.

As Senator Edward Kennedy has noted, many have stated
that they would rather face the courts, where there has been
only a one-third conviction rate, than appeal to various
clemency agencies where they face a nearly one»hundred per
cent conviction rate. Most will simply wait for full amnesty.

Some Americans not involved in the clemency program have
expressed hostility toward those who have refused President
Ford’s “gift.” But as one dodger said, “I can hit you in the face
and call that a gift too. But you might not consider that as a
gift, you might consider that as punishment."

If those who died in Southeast Asia thought they were dying
for their country, or for a just cause, why must they be avenged
through a clemency program? On the other hand, if they
thought they were fighting an unjust war, or were not
representing their country, then we are certainly punishing the
wrong persons. The President's Clemency Program has no more
ended the need for amnesty than the Paris Peace Accords has
ended the war in Indochina. The United States government
continues to provide nearly 80 per cent of the Vietnamese
government’s annual budget. More Vietnamese have died since
the peace accords than the combined American casualties of
over eight years of war. American tax dollars have financed
thoser deaths.

We are faced with the prospect of a Congress which is 20
percent newly elected. Shortly they will be voting on Indochina
aid for the first time. And hopefully they will be voting on
amnesty this session, for several members of Congress have
promised to introduce full amnesty bills for consideration.

It is time to exorcise the Pentagon of its demon.

To the Editor:

Another season of swimming has
just started. Those boring swim
meets where people just swim
back and forth in a monotonous
pattern. Boy, who likes to watch
those meets? The swimmer gets in
the water and swims his fastest
stroke, making sure he has an
almost perfect streamline, But
who notices this? The spectators
don’t know what to look for at a
swim meet.

You see the swimmer go as fast
as he can towards the wall where
he turns, trying not to lose his
powerful momentum. The turn
must be timed to the exact moment
that will allow the swimmer’s legs
to push away from the wall with
minimal time loss and optimal
power in his strokes and kicks. But
most spectators miss this, they
just see a body gatowards the wall,
flip, and swim back. Exciting, isn’t
it?

Oh, let’s not forget about the
start when everybody cheers for
their friends while the swimmer
stands on the block. The swimmer
shakes his muscles, making sure
each one in his body is ready to go
all out. His mind goes over and
over each demil of the race,
sometimes thinking of childish
ways to distract his opponents.
Then, he contemplates whether he
is the fastest or the slowest in the
race while the crowd shouts away
in the stands, “Go Tom, go Bobl”
Suddenly the referee says,
“Swimmers, take your marks!"
and the swimmers mind blanks
while he gets in me best position to
shoot out as soon as he hears the
gun. He's off. But to the spectator

who has seen so many starts in an
afternoon, this part of the race
doesn’t appear challenging,

And last is the finish when the
crowd jumps to its feet to scream
for its favorite swimmers. To the
Swimmer this is the culmination of
his race as he struggles to finish as
fast as he can. He may have
somebody even with him, but he
has exhausted his energy and 15
going as fast as he can. He touches
the wall as soon as he can,
knowing that his opponent is at his
side. Whew, a relief to the crowd.
Everything is over; another event
is finished, so many more to go.

But the swimmer sits on the‘
bench exhausted, trying to catch
his breath before his next event.
How boring!

See you at the next swim meet.

To the Editor:

Following the slide presentation
on Sexism and Children’s
Literature a group of women
remained to discuss plans for
Women’s Group activities for the
semester.

Our original intention was to
work towards a women’s week for
April. However, we decided that a
women‘s Semester of continuous
activities would provide a better
forum for sharing ideas, ex-
periences, and ourselves, and for
strengthening the community of
Grinnell women,

We invite‘everyone to join us in
an ongoing exchange for
celebrating and exploring our
feelings about ourselves and each
other.
