Friction at Stanford University.

Because ol the trouble between
certaii members ottlie faculty and
pen-cis- of the university, iactionul
lechng is it a high pitch The
students have tlivitlctl; one class,
the conservatives, are in favor of
an entire tecolHtlucthn, and the
reinstatement of all members of
the taculty who resigned out oi
sympathy with Dr. Ross. They
alsofavorarcqucsttllnthli's.Stan-
iortl resign from the management
of the university. The students
lioni the litciaiy, historical and
economic departments comprise
this faction, while the radicals, as
they call themselves, are mostly
from the scientiﬁc departments,
They iavor patching the matter up
with as little injury to the univei»
sily as possible.

A few days ago onc ot the men
was ducltccl in a large reservoir for
attacking the policy or the anthol-
ities. The meti who have with-
drawn their connection from the
university, in sympathy for their
tellow professor, are some of the
strongest on the laculty. and thus
the university ﬁnds itself in a sc-
rieusprcdicamcnt.

plete report of the state CL‘uCallOlh

portancc rests in the fact that just
now when so many prospectivc
graduates are looking rorward to
their own struggles in the various
pursuits otlifc, a little information
conceming the public schools will

not come amiss, especially to
those intendingto teach. Its sub-
ject matter comprises complete
