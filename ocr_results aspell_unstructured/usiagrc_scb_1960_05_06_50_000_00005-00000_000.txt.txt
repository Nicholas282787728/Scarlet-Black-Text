“During tlle' German occupa-
tion I lived in the country.”
Szyc writes in his biography
received by the freshman class
president, Zal chkowitz, last
week. At that time he started
going to an illegal elementary
school. “in 1943," he continues,
“my father stopped working (as
a clerk) because of the bad
state of his health,"

In secondary school Szyc he-
came especially interested in
economic geography and in-
troduction of political econo-
my. After finishing secondary
school in 1951, he worked as
a clerk while writing articles
in "some provincial newspa—
pers and for the radio. These
were mainly. on economic
problems." '

At the same

time _he con—
[tinued studying history and
economics and then in 1955
went into the army. In 1957 he
began to study at the Econom»'
ics Faculty oi, Warsaw univers-
ity, where he has been since
then. -
After spending a year in the
United States, Szyc wants to
return to Poland to teach and
do further research in the field
of economics.

 

 

Between 20 and 25 Grilinell‘,
students staged a peaceful anti—‘
military demonstration in front
of Darby ngm last Saturday‘
night, as the ninth annual Mi-
itaiy Ball was in progress.

The students began their
demonstration, protesting arm-
ament and the presence of the
Air Force lteservc otficcr
Training Corps at‘ Grinnell, a
few minutes before the dance
hogan. They walked in a small
circle outside the gym, sing.,
ing folk songs and hymns and
carrying signs against arima-
ment and ROTC.

Ben Barber and Tom Knott
participants in the deinonsi
tion and instrumental in its o
ganizatioii. said this week that r
the students were protc. ng twol
things: “the lack of citorts on
the part of the United States
government to support pcaccl
movements and the presence at ‘ '1
a military establishment

(ROTC) at an educational
Stilulion.’_’
