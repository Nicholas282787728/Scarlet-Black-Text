out that all professors who
offered 4-?» courses last year
are continuing to do so this
year, some of them are adding
other 4-3 courses, and that
other professors have joined
the program. He also noted
that the faculty voted that
any upperclass course could

Completing Education Begun In 1931,
Upson Plans Toward Goal As Teacher

Of the class of seniors leaving at semester is Helen
Upson, who completes this month the education she began

at Grinnell in 1931.

Miss Upson, a veteran of 14 years‘ service in the Navy
that included duty in Alaska, has a goal of teaching Ameri-
can history and government. She is planning postgraduate

study second semester.

Experience at the Armed
Services Information school
gave Miss Upson the incentive
to teach. On the faculty of the
department of defense school
for three years, she taught mix-
ed classes from all American
military services as well as
otficers of many foreign coun-
tries including lndia, Korea.
Egypt, Argentina, Brazil, Eng-
land. and others.

“The lack of understanding
of our own government and
its history was all too evident
in these discussions in which
our well-educated officers had
their knowledge challenged by
wellvedu cated rcpresentativ e s
of other nations and cultures,“
Miss Upson recalled. This de-
ficiency in the Americans
stimulated her teaching ambi-
tian.

Miss Upson originally enter.
ed Grinnell in 1931 as a trans-
fer from Syracuse university.
She majored in history, with

a minor in decoration. Finan-
cial hardship. typical of those
times, forced her to leave a
yea: short of graduation. She
will be just two hours short
of her Grim-tell degree this
semester and will he award.
ed the A3. diploma in June
after making up the deficiency
elsewhere. .

For 10 years Miss Upson
worked as an interior decorator
on the staffs of W&J Sloane
in New York and Wanamaker-ls
in Philadelphia.

in 1943 she decided to do
something ‘in war work and
entered the WAVES. She ate
tended Officer Candidate school
at Smith college, and graduated
with a public information offi-
cer classification.

For 16 months at the K0-
diak, Alaska Naval station she
worked as public information
officer for the Alaskan area
on the staff of Admiral Ken-
neth Craig, commandant of

on returning to the academic
