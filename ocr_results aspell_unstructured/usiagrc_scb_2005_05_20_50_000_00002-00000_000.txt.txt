or course, there is good and
bad in everything, but I liked
Grinnell in many ways Mainly,
I loved people I met here. They
are all intelligent, bizarre and
weird. some friends and profesV
sors here deepened rny knowle
edge and had a huge impact on
howI think and act now. I liked
the fact that I didn't have to take
only economicserelllted classes.
i liked how all the things were
free here: movies, foods, con-
certs and beer. I liked how each
year seniors talked about their
good old days and complaining
about freshman.

my ﬁrst year, 1 opened all the
windows or south campus loge
gin with a former vice president.
Sorry.

7121! me a little bit about your
timing experience {Bryant/111}!
ﬁrm/(dancing), tux/1 explain 'wbat
you'rt doing with the :tick in Mir
Mala:

Most people who know me
see me as a breakdancer, but ac-
nially I was engaged with other
dances as well, I was in Emanate
my ﬁrst two years (haha, good
memoryt I've been involved
with Javanese dance since my
first year and participated in the
Dance Troupe show three times

So why am a holding a stick in
the courtyard? well, I’m dancing
a tree and being a tree.WhatI’m
doing is Butoh, an avant-garde
Japanese contemporary dance
The funny thing is I didnt know
anything about it except name
until I did research on it in a
Modern Dance course here, Afr
tet that,I took a workshop with
one of the founders of Butch in
Japan and had a chance to per
rorm with him. This court yard
is memorable for me because it’s
where I did my first solo per—
rorninnce in my life. So I really
appreciate the way Grinnell has
inﬂuenced my life.
