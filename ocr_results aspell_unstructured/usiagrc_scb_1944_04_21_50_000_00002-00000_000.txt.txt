No Returns of Jrhe Day — -

April 20, 1944
Dear Adolf—

Before we stnl' we must apologize a
bit for this lette. It isn’t quite what
you expect, perhaps, on this, your 55th
birthday, audibelieve us—it isn’t exactly
what we would like to send you. But be~
cause we, back here, can’t be there in per-
son to present your birthday remembrance,
we want at least to explain what is going
to be and why it may be delayed.

Mail service isn’t what it used to be.
Trans»Atlantic shipping has its difficulties,
yet what we are giving you is too big for
air express, so we are sending it alongr by
boat. Can’t tell you for sure when it will
a ve, but we know you are waiting for
it anxiously. We promise it will be even
more than yoll expected.

Meanwhile, of course, we can't let your
anniversary go by with no notice at all,
so we did send a sample, smaller but very
select, by air express last night.

it scarcely seems possible that this is
the tenth year in which we have known
you well enough to mark your birthday—
and even less possible that in our own
ignorance it has taken us so long to realize
just what the appropriate gift for yoll
would be. But now we think we have iti
the ideal thing, and we trust the coin-
pletencss of this year’s memorial will make
up for the inadequacies of the past.

When you point out that the efforts
directed toward you seem almost too much

,for you to accept from only one source,
we agree that you are quite right. This
gift of 1944, though to a great degree as—
sembled and packaged here, represents a
token of peculiar esteem from a great and
varied collection of your acquaintances.
Because we want you to understand how
many people thought of you in this con-
nection, we enclose herewith a partial list

of those from whom came the inspiration
for and the material of this gift.

There are, first, all the people of this
nation, and of Eng and, and Russia. Per,
haps you already knew that. But include
also vour nearest neighbors in Denmark,
NDl'l ay, Holland, Belgium, Czechoslovakia
and Poland. We are sure you know of the
portions of this present prepared by those
French in Africa, Norwegians in Canada,
and Poles in England. But don’t miss the
contribution made by some Frenchmen in
Franceiyou didn’t count on that. Those
are better known dOUOIS.‘

The contribution of certain slnallel
groups has been too great to escape spec
clal notice, however.

We commend to you especially the part
of the people of Lidice. You thought them
dead: How can that be, when so lnuch of
what no send you is possible because of
the meaning and the destiny they gave to
our work‘.7 No, no,ithe people of Lidice
surely want you to know this is from them
—from them, and the people of Coventry
and those 01' Trondheim, and all those who
committed the crime of geography.

It is from the men who didn’t get off
the Dunkirk beach, and from those who
had to leave them there. It is from thirty

thousand people who lived in Rotterdam,»

and from the thousand who starve each
day in Greece. It is from students in Prague
and Oxford and the Sorbonne and Grinnell,
Iowa. It is from everybody everywhere
who likes Mendelssohn and Thomas Mann
and who thinks Albert Einstein should be
able to shout his head off even if most
people don’t understand him. It’s especially
from people who think a man should be
able to shout his head off even if most peo-

ple do understand him and don’t like what,

he says. This is flom Methodists and
Buddhists and sophomore students of phil-
osophy; from farmers and pharmacists
and movie star Part of it was made in
Detroit and part at Alameda, Calif., and
part on the 1' er Clyde. A lot of it came
from a city called Steel and some of it

we think was carried a thousand miles to

Chungking~maybe you didn’t expect that,
but it’s in there.

\ This present, Adolf, is from a bunch
of people that don’t even speak the same
language, but that’s all right; because, be—
lieve us, what we want to do for you isn’t
talking.

What we’ve got for you is a pretty big
thing. Adolf. We hate to make you wait,
but we’re taking it easy to insure perfect
deliveryiwhen it gets there you‘ll see

that it makes up even for ten years of:

neglect.

A very happy birthday, Adolf. If, by
any chance it should be your last, we want
you to know that we aren’t sparing any-
thing to make this one serve for a long,
long time. We let you pick out your own
present for many yearsibut THIS ONE‘S
