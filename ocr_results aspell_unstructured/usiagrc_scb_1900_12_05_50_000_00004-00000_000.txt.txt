A Hittite Tablet.

For the past year there has
been on exhibition at the library
a relic of ancient times, which
may prove to be of considerable
value to those interested in arcth
ological research. It was present-
ed to the college by one of her
graduates, Mr. George E. White.
oi Marsovan. Tul'kcy. ,

This rclic consists ofa tragrnent
of a cuneiform tablet, written in
Hittite characters It was found
by Mr. White in the‘ruins oi Bag-
hanchni, an ancient Hittite
stronghold in central Asia Minor.
To justlvhat time it dates back is
not known. but it is probably
more than three thousand years
old, This fragment is about two
inches square, and irithin a space
of an inch and a halt there are
seven distinct lines of these Hits
tite characters. The meaning of
these remains to be seen. It was
wtthjust this Object in vicnugto
decipher its meaningithat the
Victoria Institute has asked Mr.
White to take a squeeze oi it and
send it to London. ‘

Rev. G. H. White of this city
now has the tablet, and will for
ward the impression to the Vic-
toria Institute, The tablet itself,
however.wi11 rema in at the library
as the permanent possesion of
the college.

periodicals iorthe state Library
Commission.

At the last session of the Iowa
legislature, a State Library Coni-
mission was created [or the pur-
pose of promoting the library in-
terests of the state. One or the
ﬁrst things undertaken by this
Commission has bccrl the estabr
lishrncnt oi a clearing house tor
periodicals, Old magazines are
being gathered in from various
parts ot the state. which Will be
used. especially, to incre se the

 

bound periodical department or
the libraries of Iowa.

The libraries 0[ the state have
been asked to help in collecting
tilts material, and Librarian Dongs
lass has made up a box or old mam
azlnes, which was shipped to Des
Memes last week, Another box
will be scnt in a few days. Any
persons having periodicals which
they are willingto contribute are
requested to leave word at the li-
brary that they may be called for.
Any magazines collected in Grim
ncll that are wanted by either the
town library or the college will be
reserved, but all others will be fore
watched for the use of the Come
Odd numbers, as well as
complete volumes, are useful. It
is thought that by means of thc

clearing house a ntlmbtr of the in»
complete periodical sets new in
the Glinnell libraries may be ﬁlled
out, at no expense other than that
of binding.
