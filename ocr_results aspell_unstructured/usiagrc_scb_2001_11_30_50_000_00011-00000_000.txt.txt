alcohol policy

i wanted to publicly weigh in on the new alcohol
policy at the beginning otthe semestcr, but I decided

to wait to see how the administration and the rest of

the student body at Grinnell reacted to the changes

from last year's policy, Over the course oftbe semo.

ter. 1 have come to better understand how the policy

is manifesting itselfand now feel that it is appropriate

to add my voice and opinionsa

At Joint iieard on Monday, Nov. 18, vicepresr
dent for Student Services Tom Crady reported that
there has been only one aleohohrelared incident re
ported to the RLCs so far this year. He pointed out
the student body's consciousness as the rationale for
the lack ofaleohol poisonings, leould not agree more.

However. his point seems to be falling on deafears within the rest of
the Student Affairs office.

On page three of the autumn, 2001 issue of Gr-imielertgrtzirie
there is an ariiele, entitled “The Crinnell (Wrist) Band." that ex-
plains the rational for recent alcohol policy changes at Grinnell. The
second paragraph of the article states, ”New drug and alcohol palic
cics put into plaoe this falliindudlng sparlely wristbands {or stu
dents at l-iarris partiasimay potentially save the lives of young
peoplca" As a member ofihe ad hoc alcohol oommittee, I will not
deny that were an exeeoiue number ofalcohol poisonings last year.
But 1 take issue with the administration's thoughtless lack of cube.
sion on dais issue.

“The Crinnell (Wrist) Band" goes on to quote Dean for Student
Life Jennifer Krohn: “Our goal is to change the atmosphere so there
are other options for students. So far the reaction from students has
been positive. 1 think people realire we have to do this—what we
have to do is protect ourstudents." The issue isn't that simple. though
It’s not really about protecting the students, As Tom Crady stated,
we are doing a fairly good job ofprotecting ourselves so far this so
mester, but the alcohol policy will continue to be enforced. The
issue isn't liability either, as the College has taken on increased liabllc
ity by training servers. So what is the issue, again.> The most vital
issue is pacifying the Grinncll police. ldo not blame the police for
the implementation ofthe alcohol policy. when police ofﬁcers came
to campus this semester and last, they were doing their jobs. I under.
stand that Grilmcll Magazine's target audience is primarily parents,
and that parents like to feel that their daughters and sons are pro-
tected. But, let; get real Dean [fro/arr. when I came to Grinnell 1 was
not looking for protection, and neither were most of my peers.

students should have absolute freedom to utilize their creativity
and encourage a variety ofsoeial and recreational activities at Grinncll.
The administration has clearly begun to extract the power of selt.
governance item the students. out administration has begun its
yonrney down the slippery slope. if students want to break the law,
let the students deal vvirli the police. in our administration, we don't
want a mediator that is willing to sacriﬁce our freedom to pacify a
few upset police officers. it is time to stand up for what we believe in.
lean protect myselfiusthne. Tom Cradyand l have faith thatoiber
students can as well. lfonly the rest oftlie administration were so
conﬁdent in the studenis. You om made this one down as a negative
response, Dean Krohn. Give us that liability back, That liability is
freedom. Crinnellians, ifyou have a voice, spedt up on this issue.

Support green
energy on campus

in light ofthe ongoing campus dialogue about self-governance,
we would like to encourage Crinnell students to put some of that
governance into practice diis week by contacting daeir senators about
an upcoming vote in SCA. Next Monday, SGA will be voting on a
resolution urging the college to ttlse advantage ofAlliant Energy's
upcoming feature that allows commercial institutions to purchase
renewable energy, In other words, Grinncll College will soon have
the opportunity to take action against global warming by switching
from greenhouse gas polluting fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy
While inillally, it mayseem that voicing your support for this resolu.
tion will not do much to stop the problem ofglobal warming, talting
this onesimple step to support the renewable energ resolution actu.
ally can help bring about the renewable energy revolution.
