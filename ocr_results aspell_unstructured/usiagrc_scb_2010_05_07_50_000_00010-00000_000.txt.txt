A dreamdeferred is a dream revised

Are you ready?

This 1s the beginning of the End, and l m feeling all sorts of
confu-stalgia so let's hit play on that end of summer- camp-
photo montage- -Powchoint and cue up some Vitamin C on
the boom box. Chyeahhhh. Also, ifyou don't understand that
reference I probably hate you.

My classmates 1nd 1 will all be presumably gradu1ting 1n
something like less th1n twenty days or so No, 1fyou re asking,
I do not have 1 job yet, and no I 1m not pltnning on trying
to get rejected from grad school As mv v1gilance for this 11n-
peding emotional catastrophe, a.k.1 Commencement, has been
telling Chewbacca to kick on the hyper-drive, I've been doing
a whole lot of thinking. That thinking, namely, has been about
what it is that] can take w1th me so that I can keep “living the
dream" even as I set sail on a “Deadliest Catch” without Mike
Rowe to guide me ashore.

In a search for some answers about what's been of use over
the years, I recently decided to go back 1nd read some of the
angsty things which I wrote to myself as a precocious young
dream-liver. You know, notes on post-its, Myspace rants, the
usual. Back in the wonder years of first-semester, I had an ex—
perience which some might find unsurprising for someone so
self—aware of their need for afﬁrmation and attention I was
concerned with why people couldn't just like me NOW, and
why I couldn't just feel like all my relationships were perfectly
centered from the moment they started. “Well duh, ﬁrst-year-
Tim, no sh't you found it hard. You can't just show 11p to a joint
and have it all fall into place, especially not when everyone old—
er than you is on Red-Alert for overtly extroverted firsteyears."

I tried going to therapy. you'd think you'd feel special when
you’re paying them to listen, but apparently becoming a doctor
of something doesn't always mean that you're the kind who
knows how to help people My sleep got worse. I felt anxious
all day, especially right before bed. Next came the multi-month
debate about what I'd be compromismg ifI tned anti-depres-

sants, more formally referred to as SSRIs, the mind-numbing
dev1ees given out by Big Brorhcrc ZingThree years, one month,
fifteen days, and sit prescriptions later, I can tell you exactly
what it is that I've compromised. I've compromised my mm
in the monolithic narrative ofThe Progress of Science for a
provisional 1cceptance of the short story th1r sometimes,
some methods work out for some people Ive compromised
my 11bido, my heart, and my memory for .1 semi funct1on1ng
social life and the ability to get out ofbcd 111 the morning I've
compromised time, money, and 1 transcendentalist conception
ofthe independence ofn-ialn" for the fairly consistent capacity
to choose to want to staya live I wouldnl say
Ive compromised everything, but' it s deﬁnitely
been enough for me to take notice

Getting older has helped, with the excep-
tion ofthat moment at the dessert island when
you fear for 1 few seconds that you're re1lly all
alone. What it really has taken mostly is just
a f‘ck ton of patience. That With a little court
age in the mix, frequently adjusting the pro-
portions in order to blend the perfect "self-esteem" cocktail.
Patience to slow down and get to know people and not rush
myself to have unrealistically meaningful relationships, but
courage to make myselfvulnerable to somebody ifthat's what's
on my radar. Patience to remind myself that I'm not my papers,
tests, or my grades, but courage to try to make the sacriﬁces
necess1ry ifl want to work harder next time. Patience to know
that being at Grinnell is not supposed to be any sort of experi-
ence other then the one I envision for it, but courage to do the
work necessary in getting there.

I defer to 1 corny, unsophisticated message which I wrote
a poster that hung on the wall of my dorm room. I used the
poster as a place to put this constant reminder. I wrote, in red
sharpie: "Get up, Tim, and get out ofbed.The drugs won't do
it roryou,"NewI'm not suggesting all Grinnellians everywhere

get themselves a good pocket mantra,but I am asking that they
at least take a moment to do whatever is necessary to remind
l/Jt'fllrll’i‘lﬂ to havejust a little more patience, a little more court
age, or a little more whatever

Basically, the unforninate mornl of this story is that I've
learned thatyou cant always rely on other people and that some—
tunes you have to do the heavy lifting yourself. Don't Just w11t
for your SA or your parents or your professors or student Afr
fairs to show up and make it 111 better.They might They should,
But that doesn't always mean they wrll Take c1re otyoutselves,
and take care of each uthcrr Do whatever is necessary for you

to feel capable, 1nd

then pay it forward
Thus the only way
we re going to make
it through this
thing in one piece.

Or you could
say the hell with
my advice, the hell
with this crap about care, and the hell with this whole damn
column. Who 1m I to tell you what to do with your 11ft, right.>
Well, you're right Dudereotomy, I'm not really anyone in par
ticular. But I like your moxie for calling me out on it, and that’s
why I challenge you to make it that easy. What a cool breeze
of awesome it would be iflife were that simple and if cherries
and rainbows just fell into our laps as a magical unicorn gal—
loped through the gates oft/11111111. I' ll keep my fingers crossed
However until then, Ive got no intention ofgiving up on any
of you, or any last bit of myself for that matter. At least Im
hopeful that when that day comes, maybe r/ean we 11 be living
the dream".

This is my ﬁnal column for the Sij, at least for a while,
and I've thought a lot about what a final column should be.
Particularly at this time of year, it seems ﬁtting to write some-
thing for the graduating seniors, to offer some sage advice and
words ofwisdom from a respected member ofthe faculty Un—
fortunately, none of the respected members of the faculty will
return my calls, so I guess it's up to me to drop some knowledge,
Amer-style.

guy who ran the place gave me 550 only after I argued for 10
minutes that his initial offer of$40 was unacceptableThere’s a
lesson in there somewhere, but I'm not sure what it is

At the commencement ceremony, you’ll hear some intereste
ing statistics about the graduating class, Some statistics, how
ever, you can only and here.

Out of the roughly 400 semors who are graduating: 2 7 8
of you committed intentional or unintentional acts of pla—

 

People will tell you that
graduation isn't really the
end, but rather the begins
ning of 1 whole new ad-
venture, the first step on
the next phase of the won-
derful journey of your life:

this is why the ceremony is

When you leave Grinnell, you may be surprised by how the
real world works. There are 1 few things you should keep in
mind,

Selfegovernanee doesn’t apply in the real—world Instead,
there are laws. Lots of laws. You should familiarize yourself
with them.

It turns out that some holidays are not nationally recog-
nized. October 10 1nd April 20 have no speci1l s1gmf1c1nce
after you rece1ve your diploma. When those days roll around
next year, take a minute to let out a huge, sub-free sigh and then
get your ass to work.

There is no 100 Days or anythmg l1ke 100 Days for adults,
At least, I've never been invited to 1 100 Daysetype party for
grown-ups. If you fmd out that there is one, please earned or

entirety, and you are the seven
seniors best equipped to handle the many challenges of the
modern world. 356 ofyou will have attended Block Party. 13 of
you w1ll remember attending Block Party.

But the Senior Class cannot be reduced to mere statistics.
Each ofyou has an 1mpor11nt story to tell and a song in your
heartr For most ofyou, however, th1t song 1s prob1b1y some-
thing by Lady Gaga or Miley Cyrus, 1nd I ﬁnd that horribly
depressing.

Hey, do you realize that the next time someone calls you a
“senior" the word will be followed by “citizen"?

Some readers may object to the tone ofthis piece because
it doesn't adhere to the conventions ofan endeofrtheesemester,
pre—gmduation send—offcolumn. Some ofyou are undoubtedly
thinking, “Professor Arner, we know that you're in amazing
teacher, an incredible scholar and a great Writer, You also carry
yourself with an 1ntense sophistication nicely tempered with
youthful charm and enthusiasm. But wh1le youie keeping it
real, as 1 man ofyour integrity and stature always does, could
you also give us some words otencouragemenp"

I can 1nd I will. Your tune here has allowed you to grow
and mature and develop in impo1t1nt ways. you've received 1
quality educanon, both acadenncally and socmlly, and you can

leave here knowing that you possess a variety ofskills that will
allow you to meet the exciting challenges that lie ahead. It's
now time for you to take your place in that proud tradition of
Grinnellians who carried their education with them into the
broader world 1nd made 1 positive impact on their commune
tiesr I know that you'll make us proud.

But in these difficult economic times, keep in mind that if
you're ever short on money, you can sell 1 used copy won the
Places You'll Go"on Amazon for $3.52.

Now let me get personal for a minute and reﬂect upon my
own time here. As I mentioned, this is my last column for a
while, 1s I’m officially retiring from the columnewriting busie
ness. I am grateful to have had this opportunity to be part of
the Finest Student Newspaper West of the cedar River and
East of the Mighty Des Moines,

I need to thank the editor of the Opinions section for her
support and guidance during the writing of each column; she
deserves 1 lot of credit for shap1ng the ﬁnal product.I also want
to thank the editorsrin-chief for the past year, who worked
tirelessly each week to bring the S653 to the entire Grinnell
community I'm not kidding when I say that these three amaee
ing students 111ve absolutely earned my admiration and respect,
and itwas 1 tremendous pleasure working with them.

My own humble contribution to the seal; dur1ng this p1st
semester has been a labor of love I had hoped that it would be
a different kind oflabor, the kind where a man receives a mone
ctary reward for his serVices, but it's been :1 labor oflove instead
because these jerks have refused to pay me. Was the title of my
column not a big enough Clue?

In the end, however, maybe I shouldn't be in it for the mon-
ey. Perhaps it's more 1mportant that 1 gave people something
to think 1bout, provided some \nliiable gu1d1nce with 1eg1rd
to topics like howling 1nd vampires and believing 1n yourself
I live to give, my friends, and I hope that you ve cnjovcd what
I had to offer As you go out into the world, I especially hope
that my words will help you achieve great things, and that one
day you'll ﬁnd vourselfin the pos1t1on to gwe a lltLle something
back, Because I’m serious about that 100 Days thing, Holler at
your boy.
