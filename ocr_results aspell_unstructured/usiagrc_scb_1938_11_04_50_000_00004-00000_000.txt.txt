Homecoming Celebrations at

Grinnell Date Ba

By John Marion

To the many returning- grads,
homecoming is an established in-
stitution, one which has always
existed. The gradual evolution of
the celebration was a slow trans-
formation.

The first accurate knowledge is
recorded in a 1912 issue, of the
Scarlet and Black, after which no
mention of the affair is made un—
til 1919. Since then, there has
been a gradual enlargement of the
celebration, until the present sta—
tus has been reached.

Football is Feature.

Naturally, all homecomings
hinge upon the football game.
Grinnell has enjoyed only moder-
ate success in winning its home-
coming contests. The Pioneers
have won five games. lost 12, and
tied three. In the first home-
coming game, in 1912, Cornell
won the game 10-0. There was no
program; a reception followed the
game.

Our next homecoming was not
until 1919 when the Scarlet and
Black, as the Pioneers were then
called, again played Cornell, this
time to a 7'7 tie. other festivi-
ties included a pep meeting and
a play.

Elaborate Program in 1923.

In 1921 homecoming was held on
Armistice day, and a double cele-
hration was held. On a snow cov-
ered field the Pioneers defeated
Cornell 134), The 1923 celebration
seems to have been the first one
for which an elaborate program
was planned. A stag dinner, sev-
eral receptions, and reunions were
on the program. Kansas Aggies
ruined the occasion by winning
414).

.Ames came to Grinnell for the
1924 homecoming and was defeate
ed 14713, in a thrilling battle.
Ames scored twice in the first
quarter, and the Pioneers came
back to take the game.
