Hoping there is still 'some change to spare

Grinnell student, faculty and resident perspectives on current politics and the anniversary of Obama 5 election

Students

It has been roughly one year since Baruck Obama was elected to the White House, making
history and promising Change. Since then, he has taken on numerous pivotal issues, and in the
process, he has been called a socialist, a communist and a Nazi, won a Nobelpeace prize and been
asked his opinion on issues ranging from protectionism to the lyrics orJay-z,

Though progress admittedly has been slow, Obama's campaign mantra orhope and change
still echoes in many students’ears.“1t was the most amazing thing ever," Anna HalpincHealy’ll
said, recalling the night ofthe election she spent in the streets ofHarlcm. "There were people
everywherelistening to New York public ofﬁcials, watching the results come in on julnbmtrons
set up in the street and literally marching down 125th st.“

Mikel Shybut '10 remembers staying up all night at an American diner in Moscow, where
he was studying abroad. “I was elated," he said. “I was with a lot of other Americans and just
[Obama‘s] image on the screen brought people to teiirs.To see the culmination of two_ years of
hard work was just breathtaking and surreal."

More than 200 days of presidency have since tempered Shybut’s optimism, but he acknowl»
edged that any signiﬁcant policy changes were likely to take time. Other stus
dents expressed similar sentiments, including Elisabeth Rennick '11, a coahead
orCampus Democrats. “1 always supported Obama,"she said. “But I was never
under the illusion that change would take place overnight"

Kevin svendsen 10, a former member of the recently inactive campus rec
publicans, pointed out that the time it has taken in some ways has nothing to
do with Obama himself. Our government was explicitly designed so that you
couldn’t change things,” Svendsen said. “So policy enactment would be slow."

Yet some students said they feel that Obama’s continuous attempts at com-
promise and bipartisanship are preventing him from efficiently achieving his
potential as president. “In layman’s terms, it feels a little like Obama is giving
Americans ‘jungle juice —it’s sweet and it goes down easy," Josh Wassink '13
said, during a debate hosted by the Grinnell college Debating Union on Tues
day that assessed the president's rate ofpromised change. “But perhaps what the
American public really needs right now is something more like whiskeyﬁsome-
thing that's uncompromising and something that will get thejob done."

Health care reformia cornerstone of his campaign and early days in of»
ﬁceiis a controversial issue that has yet to be resolved. One ovaendsen’s chief
concerns is that if there is no money to be made in ﬁnding new treatments then
pharmaceutical companies won’t spend the money on research. “Big pharma, as much as we all
like to hate them, does provide a valuable service," Svendsen said.

Regardless of how they feel about the policy itself, many are frustrated by the lack of sub
stantial health care legislation after nearly 10 months of constant discussion and coverage. “It's
disturbing," Shybut said. "But that's the process and it’s one of the reasons change doesn't come
quickly."

students also have mixed feelings regarding the economy. "Change is one thing our pockets
are sorely lacking," Derek Farman '13 said during Tuesday's debate, arguing that Obama has
failed to live up to standards he set for himseLf during the campaign. The other side countered
Farman's arguments by reminding audience members that considering Obama inherited one of
the largest financial crises in decades, the relative success of the recent stimulus package has been
remarkable.

While Obama’s inheritance ofthis crisis cannot be denied, Svendsen critiques Obama for not
combating the crisis in a new way.“’1'here’s been a lot ofcontinuityin dealing with the economic
crisis," he said, “Ifyou look at the acnial policies they’ve enacted, they're very similar [to Bush's],"

The lack ofprogress regarding LGBT Rights, speciﬁcally the repeal of the “Don't Ask. Don't
Tell" policy and the reexamination of the Defense of Marriage Act, seems to frustrate Grinnelc
lians the most. “I’m a little frustrated at the lack ofaction regarding gay rights," Rennick said.
”A lot of people voted for Obama expecting change on that front but he hasn't done much more
than talk about it."

While many students feelings have gone from hopefulness to uncertainty, Garrett Fortin
'11, another co-head ofCampus Dems, had his doubts last fall. “I am very skeptical ofAmeri-
can politicians and I was unsure Obama's filghty promises orchange would come to fruition.”
However, Fortin said that over the past year Obamas noble rhetoric and smaller, less publicized
actions such as closing Guantanamo Bay and passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act have
greatly improved his opinion .

If Fortin’s opinion about Obama can change in a year, maybe, as students express, there is
hope for Obama after all. “A lot ofthings still need work,"Fortin said. “But I think that [Obama]
is absolutely on the right track and I expect another year will yield great things.”

Grinnell Residents

Despite the all- --too common student assumption that the Grinnell community is generally a
conservative small town, Grinnell residents questioned said they voted for Obama in last years
election and continue to support his presidency, through a little bit of thick and a lot of thin

“I shared many ofthe same philosophical views with him, said Grinnell resident seth Kite,
a school psychologist, said. Isaw him as a change something that would be productive for our
socie . .

F2; Craig Cooper, owner of Bikes to You in downtown Grinnell, Obama represented what
he said was a welcome change from the eight years ofFormer President George W Bushs exectr
tive reign lwas hopeful that he represented a wholesale change from the Bush administration,
primarily in respect to [U. s. ] foreign pol icy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Cooper said

As it turned out, the Grinnell residents questioned were not so tough on Obama, similar to
views expressed by students and faculty. “1 think you're going to have a hard time finding [some-
one that does not support Obama],” said Stan Greenwald ’55, a retired Grinnell physician, an
opinion that some may call patriotic, others one-sided.

Regardless of support for Obama, residents expressed issue with the media's often positive
treatment orObama. “He's certainly been a ‘media darling: As an Obama supporter, I recognize
the media has not been very tough on him," Cooper said

Cooper cited the economy, more specifically "monetary policy,"as something the media could
have been tougher on Obama about. “I am very, very apprehensive about the economic future
of our country. The monetary policy in the last 18 months, which is not all Obama’s doing, is

Anticipation for change ran high on November 4th, 2008, when Obama was elected presi-
dcnt, eliciting personal ieactions that eclipsed thosc ofany other recent election. “A great deal of
America was extiemcly ebullient about Obamaiintoxicutcd. People were crying the streets. [It
was] well beyond what you normally see,"sald David Western, Political science and Peace Studs
ies. “America was intoxicated with this regeneration ofitself. . . now we could actually become the
ideal of America. ~

Bringing about the ideal ofAmerica is a tall order. From the beginning of Obamas presir
dency in January, Americans had to descend from the euphoria ofhis election to the reality of
politics. The pasryear has caused many to question his ability to follow through on the promises
he made

“There are expectations on Barack Obama as a president that would be difficult for any presi-
dent coming after the Bush years,” Katya Gibel Mevorach, Anthropology, said.

Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, he hasn't seen the support he needs for his
more radical plans. “I’m more disappointed with the Democratic Congress, that they have not
shown more backbone in supporting some of those policies," Ciaig Upright,
sociology, said

Ellen Mease Theater, pointed out that the economy specifically will not
be cured as easily as electing a new president The economic downturn was a
long time in the making under Bush and it will take a long time to come out,"
she said.

Gibel Mevorach recalled the excessive liberties taken by the previous ad
ministration, pointing out that presidents are not actually dictators, and even if
Obama had full congressional support, the office of the presidency itselfis not
strong enough to change an entire country in less than a year.

Western agreed that it will take more than one man, to make progress.
“There are much, much deeper changes that are required in this country that
need ro be spurred on by a much wider democratic movement ifpeople want to
see the changes that they were hoping for," he said.

Western cited the interdependence of American industry and the military
as something that cannot be changed by the turnover ofone administration. "A
great deal of military policy, what Obama can and cant do, is guided by that
[militarily industrial] structure, Western said.

He described the collusion between the Pentagon and private contractors as
created and crafted over decades It' is directly related to the war in Iraqia war that Obama has
promised to end Yet' it is impossible to deconstruct it in the space of 10 months and without a
nation- -wide call for action. ' ,

The same is true for other possible policy changes. Obama may have a choice between doing
some radical things and being a one term president .or not doing enough radical things and
not living up to his promises of changing America, and maybe getting a second term,"western
said.

Whether he pursues radical policies or not, the professors questioned seemed to agree that
Obama has still been successful in bringing America forward from the country ofhis predeces-
sor. “I think that he 5 made tremendous progress in rolling back some ofthe worst excesses of the
Bush administration,” Upright said.

Obama has started to go beyond simply rectifying the mistakes ofBush and Cheney, specif‘r
cally when it comes to his health care bill which is more extensive than any other president has
attempted before.“That he's managed to push in a public optionithat's something that’s never
been done,”Western said.

Still, the health care program has yet to be passed, education has yet to be reformed and
soldiers remain in Iraq. “Obviously he has a lot of goals that have not been achieved. I am still
hopeful that he’s laying the groundwork for doing that in the furure," said Upright.

Upright noted that one of the ways Obama has been preparing the country for his policies
is in changing the way that the executive branch operates. “He has established a protocol that...
allows congress to craft legislation with his support and encouragement. He has demonstrated
that he is willing to treat Congress as an equal branch of government," said Upright.

Gibel Mevorach pointed to the specific promises Obama made during his campaign, and
added to them. “I hope that there Will be movement on everything related to immigration—I
hope that there will be improvement on the educational front...1 wish that there would be a
works project that created a public transportation infrastructure," she said.

Obama still has three, if not seven,years to reshape our political landscape, and prove that our
hope was legitimate and our trust not misplaced. "Now is the time that he’s got to start making
some changes, start taking control,"Westcrn said.

unprecedented,“ Cooper said. “There has been more money pumped into our economy in the
last 18 months than there was in the previous 45 years-I don’t know if it's exactly that, but it‘s
been very close."

Cooper admitted he could not blame all ofrecent policies on Obama. After all one third of
the time in which the money pumping into economy that Cooper described, was implemented
while George W Bush was still president.

On the other hand. Angela Harrington, president and CEO of the Grinnell area Chamber
of Commerce said,"This is a brand new economyi hope that most plans ofthe past are thrown
out because this a whole new day."

Harrington talked about a new level of government support to “keep the economy running."
She tied much of Obama’s pioposed and enacted policy to the role of the local Chamber of
Commerce and how it needed to take on a new role.

Despite his anxieties regarding Obama’s economic policies, Cooper pointed otit that Obama
is not the only figire responsible for enacting change. “it would appear that maybe his ideals
have been shackled by Congress,"cooper said. “It seems like he's spent a fair amount ofpoliticnl
capital trying to get some things done, and has not been super successful."

Kite, too, was sympathetic to the difficulties Obama has faced with so much piessuie placed
seemingly solely on his shoulders. “I think Obama has a lot ofdifferent challenges as president,
and it’s been difficult to implement change. Different parties have also made that even more
difficult to do."

Kite pointed to the need to combat these issues orcooperarion in order to make progress. “I
see him as a collaborator," Kite said. “Finding that middle ground is important."
