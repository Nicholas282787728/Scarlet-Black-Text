chiefly in the loaning of money to
the unemployed without return
work,”

“England's place among the powers
of the world has altered from that
of leader, but there must be someone
to set the pace and exercise influ-
cncr," Rateliffe said. “Five years
ago all nations looked to the United
states to do that. They thought the
period would he one of Americaniz—
ation. It was thought that the
American high road to prosperity
was permanent.

“Something definite has happened
though and soviet Rusisa has become
a matter of consciousness. Now can
Britain do anything tlirii long po—
litical, social, industrial experience;
or can the United States: or will wc
be driven by the profound purpose
and spirit of Russia?”

Nationalist Movement

in India Discussed

England's two major problems—
the so-called ”dole" system, and the
nationalist movement in Indiai
were discussed by s. K. Ratcliffe in
a special talk for Crinncll college stu-
dents in Herrick chapel Friday morn»
ing.

In dealing with the former topic,
Ratcliffe declared that the impression
which most persons in the United
States have of England's dole sys-
tem is erroneous.

Insurance Established

Twenty years ago, employment in-
surance was established in England,
the speaker claimed. The difﬁcult
periods following the war, made it
practically impossible to care for all
of the unemployed workers by means
of this insurance. Transitional bene-
fit, or the “dole" system was then
established.

“England’s ‘heavy' industries, iron
and steel, ship-building, mining, Cote
ton, and wool, were those which were
hardest hit," Ratcliffe said. ”After
the workers had been unemployed for
the length of time covered by in»
suranee, transitional benefit was
given.

“Thus the United States deals
with unemployment completely by
the dole—voluntary givingiwhile
England deals with it by insurance,
and, within the last few years, the
doled‘

The alternative for the dole, sug-
gested hy Ratcliffe, was that all
great industries of the country should
be responsible for their own workers.

Prophesies Indian Agreement

Prophecy of an agreement between
parliament and the Indian national—
ist forces was made by the English
author in discussing his country's
second greatest problem.

Gandhi's refusal to accept an in
vitation to the first round table cull»
ference in London, and his determin-
ation to be the lone delegate at the
second conference were ascribed by
Ratcliffe to be among the reasons
for the present unsettled condition of
affairs in India,

Orient Amused
History of the nationalist move
ment in India was sketched by the
speaker. “During the past 20 yehl's,
the Orient has been aroused. Twelve
years ago. India self»govornment was
advocated, and the two recent round
table conferences in London follow-
ed."
, Conflict between Hindus and Mo-
hammedans, in which the latter have
the geographical advantage, and
Gandhi's lack of recognition of the so
or 60 million memhers of India’s de-
pressed classes were other difficul-
ties confronting lndian nationalists,
according to the speaker.
