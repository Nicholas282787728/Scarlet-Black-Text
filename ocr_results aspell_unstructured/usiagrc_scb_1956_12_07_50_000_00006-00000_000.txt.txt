This yet

, 1956, marks the 100th allnivel'

try 01' the

founding of “Gl‘lnnell university."

The importance of J

B. Gl'imlell’s dreamecomeetl'ue of

a college in the new pl'an'le settlement l as dimmed by the

mcrger with “Iowa college,"
which moved irom Davenport to
thc Grinnell university campus
in 1559, The combined institu—
tion kept the name at the older
school, which had been founded
in 19—16 by the famous “Iowa
Band," but in was the less con-
iusing name "Gl'innell college",
became ofticial.

Cultural Community

From the iii-st J. B. had plann—
ed the founding of a cultural
community with emphasis on
education and religion. Accord-
ing to the Articles oi incorpora-
tionfthe school vvas to be “sep—
arated into two departments, a
male department which shall res
semble the eastern colleges 7
a female department which shall
be modeled in its domestic are
rangemeiits and in its general
course of Instruction, after the
Mount Holvoke institution at
South Hadley. Mass."

Work on the first building,
the tcmale seminary, began in
the toll of 1856. Citizens work-
ed at night on its construction,
with “ardent women holding
candles tor light in lnthing the F
college," i

Known as the East college,,
this building was among the uni- .
V'crsity's contributions to the
merger, and served all the pur—
poses of the institution for sew
ei-al years. it was demolished,
by the tornado oi 1352. ‘

The university was financed
Jargcly by a “literary fund" set
up “to-promote the educational,
social, moral and religious ine
terest of this place. Any malei
citizen became an elector in thisr
iund by contributing $20, The
money was to be used “for the‘
support of such Literary Im‘
stitution or institutions as shall,
be established by the Board",
Most of the profits from the.
sale of the 5.000 acres oi land‘
on which the town was built‘
went into this tund.

views on slavery and temper:
ance were unpopular in the:
growing town, and city fathers
began cutting streets through~
the campus in retaliation. TheI
university’s proposal of a mer-

investigate,

One Grinnell citizen told of
the resultant flurry as the town

SCARLET AND BLACK
Committee Issues

For Prospetlives

The Committee on Admissions
has listcd the following requires
moms to aid students who will
be discussing Gl‘inncll with for-
mer high school ii-icnrls during
vacations:

The prospective student
should have 15 high school
units,,12 ot which should bc
in college preparatory areas.
Candidates must have a posi—

tive rccommendation from the
principal or headmaster and a
high school record which shows
he can successfully do college
work. This usually means a
ranking in the upper hall oi the
class. .

He should also have 2! suc-
cessful score on the Scholastic
Aptitude test oi the College
Entrance Examination board,
The use of this test as it re-
quirement for admission does
not lessen the importance of
school records, school recom-
mendntions, and personal in—
tervicws in the evaluation of
the individual applicant hy
the committee, said Robert Ci
Sauers, directur of admissions.
The Committee on Admission
does not look to academic in
tclligcncc alone but favors those‘
candidates who have a well-
ruunded high school career withi
evidence of satisiactory achieve-
mcnt both in curricular and ex-l
tracurricular activities, Sauersl
said. ‘
