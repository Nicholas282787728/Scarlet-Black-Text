Seven hundred and seventeen stu-
lents marks the total enrollment toi-

l'r’ls givt‘" ’lllt I)! I!

Five hundred and slxtyd‘ive or
his number are enrolled in the Cul~
ege proper while one hundred and
. it)‘»t\vo are registered with the
cheat oi Music.

Since the foregoing figures tor the
1913 registration are taken born the
Ictober summary, the ccinparison it-
all testiﬁes to a most satisfactory
record characterizing the beginuiiig or
he year. The number at men and
women in the diﬂerellt departments
and classes is withheld by the otrice.

An increase in every class except
the Senior is shown by a comparison
ot the two tables. the 1915 class hav-
ing a smaller number than the class
which ivas‘ graduated last spring,
The most marked increase this year is
in the Freshman class which is un-
doubtedly the largest that ever ens
tered the College.

The enrollment in the School at
Music is not as great as it was last
year when the catalogue was issued.
owing to the tact that there are so
many irregular students taking music.
it is believed that by the middle or
the year the attendance will show a
substantial increase over that ot last
year, This department ot the College
has been growing steadily tor the last
row yeais and the present year will
probably he no exception.

The Sophomores have sutiercd tlle
most or any class. having lost
two or their number during the suin-
mer vacation. The Junio s came
back with all hilt thi , of their
number and only six Seniors railed
to return to iinlsh the work for their-
degrees.

Prospects Bright for Good Band

Sixteen students, including several:
Freshmen. were oiit tor the Band ti -
oiit Tuesday night. Protessor Pierce
was present and spoke very encourag-
ingly of the splendid outlook tor a
better College Band this year. He
also presented a plan to secure a pci»
inaneilt organization and a trained
bandmaster. Eight men volunteered
their assistance. ﬁnancially. by taking
a series of instructions from the band—
master.
