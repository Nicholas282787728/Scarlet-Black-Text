Pioneer gridders down Chicago again

Reid carries for 214 yards, defense 5

by Jeff Raymond

It took the Pioneers only one minute al
15 seconds to score their first touchdown
against the Visiting University of Chicago
gridders last week as they went on to beat
the Maroons, 2745.

Freshman quarterback Scott Staufi'er
rolled to his right on the Pioneer 13 yard
line and found Mike McCrary inside the
defense with a well-placed bootleg pass
that McCrary took all the way for the.
score. Coach Ed Dombr'owski said that the
Pioneer coaches knew that the play should
work because the team practiced it all
week. .

While that particular play would not
work as well again the rest of the after-
noon, Gene Reid more than picked up the
slack by rushing for 2rd yards on only 17
carries. The mark turned out to be only
nine yards short oi the Grinnell school
record and Dombrowski said that he would
have kept Reid in the game had he known
at the time that he was so close to the
record.

The offense had trouble getting started
after suddenly drawing first blood and
came away empty arter John Egan’s inc
terception return of 3 Don Haslam pass
put the Pioneers on the Chicago 25 yard
line. The offensive doldrums continued
throughout the half and the defense had to
be called on nine times to stop Chicago.

A tumble by Grinnell running back Dave
McDonald was recovered by Chicago and
dawned on Grinnell’s 25. Chicago worked
the ball down to the two yard line and
Haslam was able to hit George Donovan, a
freshman who gave the Pioneers {its all
alternoon, in the end zone for the
touchdown. The PAT was good.

Several key defensive plays kept the
Pioneers in the game and the score tied at
seven, Egan's interception halted a drive
by the Maroons before any damage could
be done, and newcomer Steve Spreuger
made a timely grab of a pass in the end

zone and returned the hall to the l0 yard
line to end the Maroon's first serious scor—
ing threat.

Sprenger’s effort was noted by Dom-
browski as being especially encouraging,
The coach praised his entire defensive unit
for playing a key role in the victory. “I
have to give credit to the defense," said
Dombrowski after the game. He also singl—
ed out Linebacker Troy Barboaa, who had
two interceptions, for playing an ”outstan-
ding ball game."

Grinnell took the opening kickoff to their
own 46, and ror the first time in the game
put together a drive that succeeded in
moving back the Chicago deiensive line.
Three consecutive ﬁrst downs, including a
fourth-down conversion, gave the Pioneers
a first-and-goal situation on the six yard
line where Reid slid into the end zone oil
the right side or the line.

Dombrowski was pleased that the of-
iense was able to shake itself up enough
during half time to make the game plan
work, According to Dombrowski, the
Pioneers had planned to use "Ball control
with flair,” as their chief offensive
strategy. “I’m pleased that we at least
made a consistent attempt to stay with our
game plan," he said.

Two series later the Pioneers again got
within scoring position and converted
quickly on their touchdown opportunity.
Reid took the ball on one play from deep in
Grinnell territory all the way to the
Chicago five yard line betore being knockr
ed out at bounds. Some fancy footwork and
several key blocks, especially one around
the Grinnell 45, sprung the play for big yar-
dage.

Reid slammed past the defense on the
next play to increase the score to 2l»7.

Chicago, which lost for the third con
secutive year to the Pioneers, was still
thinking about going home victorious and
at one point came within a touchdown of

tying the score. smuffer lost the ball in his
own end zone for a tweapoint safety.

‘Chicago took advantage of good field posi-

tion three series later to score a
touchdown.

Chicago took possession of the ball, with
the score at 21-9 and plenty of time to come
back, on Grinnell's 36 yard line, A long run
gave the Maroons a first down on the 15 but
a penalty called the play back to the 20.
Haslam, though. found Donovan in the end
zone once again but the PAT failed and the
score remained 21—15. .

A roughing the kicker penalty called
against Chicago proved to be costly (or the
visitors, Instead of having the ball with
less than four minutes to play. the
Maroons were once again laced with have
ing to stop the Pioneers, who seemed to

realize that they had to capitalize on the
situation. _

Once again. Slauiler called on Reid to
carry the ball, and Gene responded by run-
ning {or the final tally all the way from the
Chicago 47. The kick was blocked, and the
score stayed 27-15.

Dombrowski stated that the oliensive
line, despite some pass-blocking problems,
was coming together as a unit and was
creating holes for better ball-control.

He said that although Slaulfer played
the entire game, frahrnan Steve Worth
would also be seeing more time at quarter
back. Domhrowski admitted that there
are problems with relying on a freshman
to quarterback the team, but he expected
his young signal callers to rapond even-
tually with some support and conﬁdence
from their teammates.

Loads of school spirit but no pom-poms at cheerleader tryouts

by Jeff Raymond

The anticipation surrounding last Fri»
day's scheduled cheerleader tryouts
reached a fever pitch in Darby Gym as the
time drew near for the prospective
Sideline Lovelies to go through their
routines. A crowd or around so people
waited anxiously for the fun times to begin
as the Grinnell Folkdancers coolly cone
tinued their own session nearby.

Up until the big moment of truth the ma
jor question was who had organized the air
lair. Athletic Director John Pfitsch said
that he had no idea that a squad was being
organized and SGA President John Mofiet
was simﬂarly mystified as to the true story
behind the tryouts.

The [irst‘notices appeared on Wednesr
day, Sept. 8, but nobody would claim
responsiblity for their presence. The signs
extolled Grinnell's pretty young things to
“Shave 'em and show ’em off," and to
demonstrate school spirit at the tryouts.

Rumors flew as the campus population
searched for the true identitiy of those
responsible for the cheerleader idea but
everybody who was asked including John
Sbarbaro and Ben Johnston, denied any

As the magic moment neared, the crowd
in Darby increased in Size and the level of
anticipation rose. Unfortunately, there
were very few people present who looked
like cheerleaders.

Roving reporters train the Scarlet and
Black and KDIC asked those in attendance
about the affair and received a wide range
of response as to why they came.
Everybody. though, whether irorn North
Campus or South, was hoping for a good
time.

A disappointed Andrea whitman
lamented, “I thought this guy would be
here.” Harley Liker came to see
something else, though. ”I came here to
see a little of Grinnell’s {unrloving in»
dividualism,” he stated.

Mary Anne O'Connor and Bill Mc-
Cullough had similar reasons for Ventur-
ing into the gym. O'Connor said that she
was there because she wanted to see some
school spirit and, “We thought we could
get to see some nice T and A.” McCullough
confided, ”This group I'm with is really in-
to exploitation. And so am I."

Sophomores Johnston and Sbarbaro,
who were seen putting up signs on Thurs
day night, seemed unwilling to talk to
reporters and had little insight into the

Peppencomv's

night's activities, Johnston said simply
that he‘d seen the signs and thought he‘d
show up to see what happened. Sbarbaro
had even less to say. ”That’s not my
name,” snapped somebody who looked a
great deal like him,

The whole spectacle could have become
a debacle if it were not for Neil Boris, who
calmly assumed leadership because he
was the only one with a hat. When he saw
that there would probably not be any ap
plicants for me cheerleader jobs, Boris
calmly screamed, “We‘ve got to call it
off!”

Just as it appeared that the tryouts were
going to tail to find a cheerleading squad,
three people who had just come 'from'lVlon-
ty Pyd'wn’s wardrobe room ran into the
middle of the gym and launched into the
old high school cheer, “We’re glad we’re
here." Boris proclaimed the gentlemen,
David Lilienstein, Don Swinscoe and Rich
Beck. Grinnell’s official cheerleaders.

Unfortunately, the cheerleaders did not
perform at the lootball game against
Chicago and the spirit was provided by the
Nathan Harm Memorial 013 Squad. One of
the squad’s printable cheers was, “We've
got herpes, yes we do. We’ve got herpes,
how 'bout you?" Grinnell won by 12 points,
2745. ‘
