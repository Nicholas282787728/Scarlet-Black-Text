Tito ahovc suhiect is by no means new

much to say conceining Mr. Watson's

merely to mention one or two points
which have never been properly cmphar

lack Watson is host known in lowa as
a mati who can successlully train ath-

By many he is helievetl virtually to have

by their splcitdtd physical condi oti.
While we have low in numbers we have
been able to oiisctthe increasing interest
in track alhlelics Ill alllcr Iowa schools
by Watson's skilllul coaching and trainr

that airy ioothall teaiu reasonably close

The tear is sometimes expressed that
