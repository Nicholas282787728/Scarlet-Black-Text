ON THEIR WAY

The high hopes of the Pioneer basketball fans
received somewhat of a jolt when the cagers
started off the season so inauspiciously. But fortun-
ately, the difficulty in the first two games was
nothing serious. Simply a little undue over—con.
fidence, a little over—eagerness, and—in the Iowa
State game—a handicap in height.

There seems to be no dissension among the
team members this year, as has been the Case in
so many recent Grinnell quintets. This is a handle
cap that no amount of talent, coaching and train.
ing can overcome, and its absence this winter
should do much toward making the present team
the strong quintet it might be.

How many coaches would like to be able to
Call “over—aggressiveness” their team’s worst fault,
as Coach ’I‘ruesdale hm said of the Pioneer five!
It’s a mighty healthy fault, and one than can be
coped with ever so much easier than indifference.
As the season progresses the men should be able
to Control this aggressiveness and make it a real
asset instead of the handicap which it proved to
be in the opening games.

It takes aggressiveness to make a strong de~
fensive outfit, and it has been in this department
that Grinnell basketball teams have been weakest
in the past. As the Season progresses the fouling
should be replaced by clean, effective guarding.

The Pioneers may or may not be headed for
the 1935 Valley title, but they are conceding none
of their rivals the edge at this point in the game.

We still believe that the Pioneers are going some»
where this season—and that they’re on their way.

—G
THE LEAGUE SCORES A HIT

The action of the League of Nations in bring-
ing the crisis between Hungary and J ugoslavia to
a happy settlement has brought home to many
persons the real value of the League. Many
critics who have proclaimed against the League in
the past for its inaction, realize now its position of
importance in world affairs. This crisis served
to place the emphasis on the potentialities of the
League rather than upon its limitations.

The situation brought on by the assassination
of King Alexander of Jugoslavia was strikingly
similiar to that of 1914 which precipitated the
world war. The finger of suspicion pointed at
Hungary and it seemed that Jugoslavia, backed by
powerful allies, might take measures which would
drive Hungary to resist with force. The inﬂu-
enCe of the great powers undoubtedly played a
great part in bringing about a peaceful settle.
ment. But the same effort was made in 1914
without success.

The difference was that in 1934 there was a
well organized international machinery for peace.
There was centralized diplomacy enabling far
faster action than in 1914. There was the focuss-
ing of world opinion and efforts for peace upon
one point, Geneva. There was the opportunity
for neutrals to play and important part in pacify.
ing the belligerents and to throw the light of san-
ity upon the situation.

Of Course the difficulties are by no means
over. There are still many obstacles upon the
road to reconciliation. But there seems to be
no reason to believe that the accomplishments of
the past two weeks at Geneva cannot be develop-
ed into further lasting good.

Other ~Opinions

DON’T LET IT BOTHER YOU
(Iowa State Student)

Don’t take yourself too seriously.

That very sane bit of advice was offered by a faculty
member, and it applies to the great concern about over.
activity which has been evidenced on the campus in ad-
ministrative and. student cirCles of late.

Too many students who are burdened with excessive
positions take the attitude that it is a matter of life and
death that their job be done accurately m the minutest
detail. And they so fear for iLs management that they
hesitate to trust jobs to other people.

If the student does not carry out his assignment m
the degree which is expected of him the overly serious
execution will not trust him with another job.

The faculty member went on to explain that it isn't
altogether the proficiency with which the job is done, but
it is what the individual himself has gotten out of the
task. If the individual has benefitted materially by
carrying through a responsibility, then it is no great
crime if the iob isn't perfect.

When the busybody is trying to decide which one of
the three meetingii he should attend in an evening, he
might better stop and think about what would happen if
he weren’t at any of them. Things would probably go
on just as well without. him, and he might not be missed
at all,

The “don’t take yourself too seriously" phrase is a
good bit of philosophy to keep in mind during the day
when ‘doubt and. distrustfulness make inroads on a stu.
dent’s conscience.

[By Assezilled Collenjni: Puss]

Dean Carl Ackerman, of the Colum—
bia university school of journalism,
probably is just a bit disappointed in
Sigma Delta Chi, the national journ.
alistic fraternity.

The Dean spoke at a meeting of the
group during its recent convention at
DePauw university. He talked on the
tendency of Americans to forsake the
serious things and to turn to amuse-
ments such as the radio, movies, and
sports. He finished, to great applause.

Kenneth Hogate, of the Wall Street
Jounlal, boastmaster, then arose and
announced, “I’m sorry, fellow mem.
bers, but 1 am afraid we will have to
Cut the meeting short now, in order on
get to the football ﬁeld in time for
the Hanover game." _

Then, realizing the pointedness or
his remark, he colored. A tittcr arcsc,
fell, rose higher to a general giggle,
then zoomed o1f_key to an awkward
death as the Dean stared straight
ahead.

“It seems quite possible," writes
Deane w. MalotL, of the Harvard
university business school, “that a new
demand is coming from within bank—
ing for trained and alert young men
to fill in positions of ultimate respon.
sibility.”

But—

lf the young men are alert, they
will want to hear from James P.
Warburg,’ of the Bank of Manhattan.

"Banking,” said Mr. Warburg in a
group of college students, “as a‘busi.

ness career, is dead.”

teachers in the state schools to take

that the Constitution is cracking up.

FONTAMARA by Ignazio Silunc

After reading this excellently writ.
ten novel I feel that 1 know more of
life under a fascist government WV
gime than assiduous reading of every
article on the subject w-ithin the last
seven years has taught me. This sim.
ple little story, that deals, apparently,
with Life in a small village in Fascist
Italy, pictures in the simple human
terms with which life is evaluated
among ithe flagrantly exploited Euro.
pean peasantry an existence in
every Way so foreign to that of an
American that one might easily be—
lieve the whole fabric a fanciful crea.
tion were it not that the author writes
with a seriousness and an intensity
altogether alien to the realm of corn.
edy. The fate of this little peasant
village, when it incurs the wrath of
the Fascist government, is told in the
dialogue of an old couple and their
son, who are the sole survivors of the
village’s momentary awakening and
resultant massacre. This is the kind
of book you read to the end without
laying it down. .

UNFINISHED CATHEDRAL by '1‘.
S. Strillling.

This novel concludes the trilogy be.
gun in “The Forge" and continued
in “The Store.” The author has evi.
dently aimed to present the problem
of the new South with the serious»
ness of purpose and the width of
scope with which this most interest.
ing section of the Country must be
approached. it is a ercss.section of
life in a region which is dominated
by a peculiar psychology, difficult to
understand and impossible for any—
one but a mic Southerner to portray
in a critical yet sympathetic manner.

Mr. Stribling has given us a book
that will go a long way in helping us
to appreciate the plight of the contem.
pvrary South, and he has stripped his
drama of the romance and high blown
idealism which tend to color the
Southemeis‘ thinking and, to obscure
the realities of a situation that event.
tually must be faced, The author
succeeds in working this analysis and
depth into. a rousing story, and he
holds the reader by the sheer power
of his narrative sense. It is the sort
of book, though, that I imagine has
not won many friends south of the
Mason and Dixon line.

Will Rogers, America’s ace humorist,
has been invited in attend the Rollins
college founders' day exercises, at
which he will be given a Bachelor of
the Art of Making People Grin, Laugh
and Gufiaw degree.

The origin and signiﬁcance of many
modern Christmas and New Year’s
customs were the subject of the talks
given by President John S. Nollell in
his chapel talks this week.

A Roman harvest festival, the Sat.
urnalia, and a Persian festival, the
birthday of the unconqured sun, were
the original celebrations at the time of
the winter solsticeithe time when the
sun reaches its northerniost point—
Dr. Nollen said is his talk Monday.
It was Julius Caesar who set the date
December 25 for the winter solstice.

Celebrations of the nativity of
Christ did not begin until the founh
Century, Dr. Nollen continued on
Tuesday. It was not until the twelfth
century that the name Christina was
used. Before that the season was
called Yule.

“The name Santa Claus is an Eng—
lish corruption of the Dutch corrup—
tion of the name St. Nicholas,” the
speaker declared. He told the legend
of St. Nicholas, patron saint of child.

application blanks at an early date
for the use of Appointment Bureau. it
is to the advantage of each to file his

who have not already done so, should
