Struggle for peace linked to many tensions

by John Hanson

Tragic headlines proclaiming bloodshr
ed. broken cease-fires, mounting tensions
and escalating dead] tolls in the Middle
East appear almost daily. Yet, according
to Corrine whitlatch, deep misunderstanr
dings concerning the plight of the Palestir
nians, Israel and other Arab states still
plague a distant American audience.

As a member of American Friends Sera
Vice Committee, a Quakerrsponsored
pacifist organization, Whitlatch made a
study tour of Lebanon, lsrael, Gaza, the
West Bank and Egypt in 1981, She
presented her findings last Sunday in her
presentation, “A Compassionate Peace: A
Future of the Middle East.”

Through her presentation, whitiatch
hoped to create greater awareness among
Americans of the horrors of war and
perhaps dismiss a iew ot the many myths
found outside the war»torn region.

“Too often people give up trying to
understand. . There is almost an inherent
attitude against these people." claims
Whitlatch She feels people at a distance
irom the conilict pass Judgement too early
on those living in the Middle East. "People
in the Middle East are just as desperate as
we are to get on living normal lives," she
added,

Even before the United Nations Fartir
tion in 1947, creating a Jewish state, ten»
sions in the area were high. Zones of in-
iluence set up by France, England and lta-
ly at that time divided and scattered many
lslamic groups, such as Khurdistan
Moslems

Within a year of Israel‘s creation, the
first oi five major wars broke out between
nonerelenting Arab nations and the young

Jewish state. Such previous unknown
areas as the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights
and the West Bank gained international at-
tention as strategic areas of coniiict. in
1967 Israel conquered the Sinai and
strengthened its hold in Gaza. Golan and

the West Bank all during the Six Day War.
The Arab-Israel War in 197475, Lebanese
Civil War, acts of terrorism and smaller
clashes have left the region in instability
ever since, and the recent Israel invasion
into Lebanon only adds to the list.

The effect oi so much armed coniiict is
only intensified by the geographic boun-
dries of that part oi the globe “It is hard
{or us to comprehend the size oi the area,
Part oi israel is only 10 miles wide.“
whitlatch pointed out

The hardest problem one encounters
when loolnng at the long conflict is that
both sides lay undeniable moral claims to
the region, ”We have two dilierent people
claiming the same property," added
Whitlatcii,

Rismg from the ashes of the Holocaust.
the Jews oi the world sought a place where
they could live out their religious belieis
without being persecuted The state or
Israel gave the Jews that chance to speak
out for themselves. The securing of those
‘sacred' rights occupies the leaders of
Israel to great extent

The Palestinians (in the other hand can
iind no justiiication tor having to pay lor
What others did to the Jews during World
War ll. Whitlatch was quick to point out in
her presentation, that areas of conflict are
not only restricted to or fueled by the
P,L.O:Israel confrontation,

Conﬂicts stemming from tensions arisV
lng between wealth and poverty, wester»
nization versus traditional Values, secular
rule against religious and the presence of
modern cities against a rural backdrop
abound in the Middle East. “Such tension
can be seen as one of the factors leading to
the murder of Anwar Sadat," mentioned
Whitlatch. One of the slides in Whitlatch's
presentation showed a billboard advertis-
ing men’s underwear in an Egyptian city.
The male model, however, was blond-
haired and all-American looking.

In Whitlatch's view, one great source of
Conflict and creator of tension is the
amount cl military arms In such a tiny
place “It is extremely easy tor the US to
sit back and criticize the Arabs, Israel and
the P L 0. for what they do or do not do,
but. we must remember how much we sell
arms and equipment to nations in that
region.“

Without such strong US military sup-
port one can debate whether israel could
remain the fourth strongest military
power in the world or whether the P L 0,
would be devoted to such an armed cause
without the support ofthe Soviet Union and
others.

Turning to the goal oi achieving peace.
whitlatch did seem rather optimistic As
she pointed out. the anti-War fever is final»
ly beginning to maniiest itself in the Mid
dle East. “We all hope to achieve our
greatest ideological goals, but we do have
the ability to compromise, . tor a better
iuture."

Lately, much protest directed at Israel
has come irom within the Jewish popula-
tion itseli Many view Israel's desires on
the West Bank for instance, as caged

Soviet grain official to attend
agriculture conference here

by lohn Hanson

A top Soviet government official will
highlight the Grinnell Conierence on
U.S.»Soviet Agricultural Relations to be
held September zen.

Dr. Victor Lischenko. head of the Food
and Agricultural Department of the
USSR‘s institute oi the USA and Canada,

Chapel at a pm, addressing “Agriculture
in the Soviet Union.”

Lischenko. a former agricultural at
tache in Washington. D.C., is involved in
comparative studies of Soviet and
American agriculture,

According to Professor Wayne Meyer,
coordinator of the conference, Lischenko
will attempt to cover what iS happening
with the development of Soviet agriculture
today, domestic policies regarding the in-
crease ol agricultural development and
trade relations with the West.

The current Grain Trade Agreement has

been extended ior one year by the Reagan
Administration, “What happens alter the

one year will be critical lor those involved
with iood export, such as farmers in
Iowa," Mover explained.

Joining Lischenko at the conference will
be Dr, Gale Johnson, a distinguished
economic scholar and Leo v, Mayer,
associate administrator of the Foreign
Agricultural Service of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture,

Johnson, a recent Provost of the
University of Chicago and current chair-
man of the economics department there.
will speak Monday evening, Sept. 27, on
“The United States, Soviet Union and the
World Grain Economy." An author of nine
books on economics and world food pro-
blems, Johnson is a past president of the
American Farm Economics Association
and a former advisor to the Office of the

aspirations. “Israelis are beginning to tell
their government that peace can only be
achieved through negotiations and not the
continual acquisition of land," claimed
whitlatch. Such groups as “Peace Now.‘
much like the U.S. ‘Freeze' movement and
the ‘Group of 27' are making stands behind
such ideals More political Clout, however,
will be needed in the future rather than
popular complaints.

Addressing Lebanon directly, Whitlatch
ieeis that a major step in bringing the
many factions together will be to help the
Lebanese realize that they are in fact
members of the same nation. “Somehow
the Lebanese must become aware that
they are ‘Lebanese' not Moslem groups
versus Christian groups"

Israel‘s ability to develop into a true nae
tion of the Middle East will also be crucial.
The number of Jews new born and raised
in lsrael, compared to the amount of Jews
who came irom Europe. is slowly increas
ing. The growth of the Likud Party of'
Menachem Begin versus the older Labor
Party reilects this slow change. Without
such assimilation, claimed Whitlatch. the
chance [or peace will remain dim.

Whitlatch's advice to the U.S. is to push
[or more policies such as Camp David. “It
showed that the Middle East can help to
run its own affairs." The U.S.-lsrael
Alliance. in her mind. should not be reduc-
ed. As she put it, the “U.S. needs a
democracy there."

Summing up her presentation. Whitlatch
believed that one should not always expect
stability. “but we can prevent man lrom
being destroyed. There is a chance lor
Mace,"

The iutnre of the Middle East is perhaps
still filled with many more surprises, but
as we follow the turn of events. the
message oi Corrine \Vhitlatch‘s presenta
tion, “real people live there" must not be '
forgotten,
