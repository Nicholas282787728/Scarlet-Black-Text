It Happened One Night

One of the tunniest and earliest Capra iilms. it happened One N

won academy awards tor their periormanees, prove why they were the
king and queen ot Hollywood.

The tilm is the story or a runaway heiress, played wittily by Colbe ~t.
who leaves her father and tianee in an attempt to sort out the values n

The pair. who lose their money and are torced to hitch liike. begin
with a hatred that lnevilably turns to love as they travel together and
discover they are a lot more like each other than either wants to admll.

The classic scene occurs when the couple. torced by a rainstorm to
Stay in a motel..inust maintain the cliarade ot man and wite The “Wall

that eventually comes tumbling down.

Some things in this movie will seem immediately tainilia but that is

Mr. Deeds Goes to Town

by Barry Edwards

Longfellow Deeds a man who possesses very odd habits and lsude
denly) $20,000,000. Wri r Robert Riskin and Director Frank Capra sucs
cessiully combine their comedy to portray Longtellow Deeds tGary
Cooper) as the peculiar “town poet” who inherits a large tortune and a
position in society tor which he is very eomieally i suited.

Deeds moves into a Manhattan mansion which he inherits irom his
uncle 7 accepting upper class Manhattan behavior. however. is not a
Sacri ee that he's willing to make. For recreation, Deeds chases lire
engines. slides down marble bannisters and feeds doughnuts to horses
His actions are tunny by themselves, but when combined with Deeds' in.
teraetion with SDctely's upperecrust. the movie becomes indisputably
hilarious.

Mr. Deeds Goes tn Town climaxes with Deeds proving his sanity while
trying to win the atteetion ot a woman news reporter who makes Deeds
the subject oi laughter tor the entire city or Manhattan. independently,
either situation is dittieult tor Deeds; together. they work perlectly to
compete an altogether enjoyable movie. Bring the whole iamily.

Mr. Deeds Goes to Tow it is entertainment which is equal to Riskin and
Capra's previous multirawardrwinning tilm it Happened this Night. and
Gary Cooper proves to any doubters that he can comedy act with the
best or them. '
