Hiawatha, up to date, runs as
follows:

He killed the noble Mudjokvis,

With the skin he made him mit»

Made them with the fur side in-

Made them with

He, to get the cold side outside,

Put the inside skin~side outside,

Me, ll: get the cold side outside.

Put the warm Side, fur side, in-
side.

That's why he put the fur side in

Why he‘put the skineside outside.

Why he turned them inside out
