High School
Stars Shatter
Five Records

Munsel, East Des Moines,
Breaks Two Records
in Meet Saturday

A record breaking array of prep
stars, led by Al Munsel of East
Des Moines, left five Crinnell ln-
terscholastic track and field meet
records strewn hy the wayside in
the annual event here last Sat
urday.

Mnnsell, a 190 pound East
High Des Moines speedster, ran
away from the lfiekl to shatter
the marks in both the 120~yard
high hurdles and the 2oo-yard
low hurdles. Running on a hea-
vy track m de slow by much
rain, he bett‘ ed the mark in the
Izo—yard highs of no.9, set by
Lamb of Newton, by three tenths
of a second in both the prelimin-
aries and the finals. In the af-
ternoon, he outlasted Phillips of
Webster City to win the 2oo-yard
lows in :22.9, nine tenths of a
second better than the old record
set by Powers of Oskaloosa, at
present a freshman here.

North High Wins ado nclay.

Not to be outdone by an intra-
city rival, the North High 440.
yard relay team of Hunt, Evans,
Stevens and Phillips came back
in the afternoon to shatter the
old mark of 35.7 by two tenths
of a second.

James N. Hall Slips into Grinnell
Monday to Revisit Campus Quietly

Author Gives Interview
During Unohtrusive
Visit Here

13) Frances c. Hansen.

James Norman Hall '10, came
back to Grinnell from Tahiti this
week, not as a celebrity with a
brass band, but so quietly'that
few people knew he had been
here until he was gone, The
famous alumus, coauthor of the
Bounty trilogy with Charles
Nordlioff, has been visiting rela-
tivcs in Colfax, and slipped in
Monday to look over his alma
mater.

The whisper went ‘round the
quadrangle dining room that the
guest at the faculty table was
James Norman Hall. At the very
informal gathering in the draw-
ing room afterwards, he consent-
ed to be inter-viewed by a Scar-
let and Black reporter who had
brazenly crashed the group.

Quito Tail.

The author is quite tall, with
grey hair and moustache and is
very tanned. His eyes are deep-
sct and dark, and his voice is
gentle. Mr. Hall is reputed to be
publicity-shy, but was quite will-
ing- to talk for the Scarlet and
Black. “I couldn't help noticing
how many pretty girls there are
her-e now," he said. “In my day
they all wore their hair ‘ralted’
high, and dressed in shirtwaists
and Skirts.”

Nine Seek Positions
on Editorial Board

Nine students have announc-
ed their intention of trying out
for positions on the editorial
board of the Scarlet and
Black, Jerome Newcomer,
chairman, announced today.
Those competing are: Harold
Stiniiian, Janice pitzcr, Rita
Phelps, Fritz Schmidt, Doro—
thy Launspach, Baxter Smith,
Robert Hagen, Ralph Gait and
Fred lnfelt.

”Tryouts have alrcady start»
ed, but there is still an oppor-
tunity for anyone else who
wants to tryout. They should
see me before Thursday noon,
however," Newcomer said to-
da .

”It is not necessary that the
candidates have had previous
editorial w iting experience or
actual experience in journal-
ism. All that anyone needs is
a willingness and interest in
the direction of the editorial
policies of the Scarlet and
Black,“ he explained.

From tho nine candidates,
sx uill be chosen for definite
positions on the editorial
board, and those Six along with
the editorial chairman and the
managing editor will direct the
politics of the Scarlct and
Block under the new set-up.

 

It has been five and a half
years since he last visited Grin»
nell, and two years since he was
in the United states.

Hurricane to lie Made a Movie.

"Our latest book, ‘Hul'l'icane,’
has been purchased by the mov-
imgspictures,” he stated. It will
be produced sometime this sums

hops on location in Tahiti, How-
ever. he had nothing to do with
the screening of “Mutiny on the
Bounty" and does not expect to
work with this one.

Mr. Hall gave a graphic des
scription of Tahiti, his home in
the Society Islands, There is
electricity now in the little town
of Papeete, he said, and a daily
paper which consists of one or
two mimeographed shects- of
wireless ncws, generally one. Ra-
dio is not so successful because
of static, but many of the is-
landers have phonographs.

800 Autos in Tahiti.

“There are eight hundred auto-
mobiles in Tahiti,” Mr. Hall said,
“and thcy dr‘ive 'round and ’round
the little animal: road that air
cles the island. Fortunately, not
all the cars are in repair at the
same time.”

James Norman Hall and Char—
les Nordhoff collaborate on their

plot together, the author explain-
ed. When all the details are
planned and the characters out-
lined, they divide the work into
chapters and choose the ones
each prefers to write. “When we
both want the same chapter, we
flip for it,” he laughed. The co-
authors live 15 milos apart in
Tahiti.
Lntost Book a Composite.

The hurricane which they lie
scribed in their latest book was a
composite of scvcral they have
Seen, or have heard about from
old natives, “I suppose the mo-

wait for a real one," he said.
