Theatre department
presents "The Visit"

By Michael Kavanagh

Have you ever imagined, perhaps
in a dream, that the world has sud-
denly turned against you, that even
your family and friends are out to get
you, and you can turn to no one for
help? This scenariois oneofthebasic
plot lines in the Swiss playwright
Friedrich Diirrenmatt’s work “The
Visit."

Written in the 1950s, this play
examines what would happen to a
society when one person‘s life is de-
mandedaspaymentforapast“crime."
Theplaybeginswith the townspeople
ofa tiny,backwardSwiss town called
Giillen (the name means “dung" in
Swiss) awaiting the arrival of Claire
Zachanassian, an internationally-
known millionairess.

Claire was formerly a resident of
their town, but known to them as a
social outcast named Klari Wascher.
Klari was originally supposed to
marryanotherGiillener,AlfredSchill,
but he married another woman in;
stead, apparently because of Klari's
low social position. By not marrying
her, Alfred abandoned both Klan and
the baby she was pregnant with.

Klari left Giillen and married an
Armenian oil millionaire, becoming
Claire Zachanassian. When she re»
tums to the town which had rejected
her years before, the townspeople
welcome her with open arms, de-
pending on her to help restore the
economy of their depressed indus—
tries. She does offer the town a huge

sum of money, but only in exchange
for “justice": she intends to punish
Alfred for his crimes against her, and
demands his death.

Claire’s announcement turns
Gtillen into a nightmare for Alfred as
he struggles with the thought of los—
ing his life at the hands of his own
friends and family. He must decide
who is against him and who he can
trust, all the while confronting his
own past with Claire.

This unconventionalpremise fora
play brings many issues to the fore,
such as social justice, materialism,
moral systems and revenge vs. ' s-
tice. Some would say that“The Vi t”
is a critique of the deterioration of
society and the growthof materialism
inthezomcentury.Dunenmauhow
ever, denies that he intended the play
as an oven criticism of society. He
maintains he is still a playwright, not
a theorist. and wishes only to bring
these issues to light

Despite the seemingly dark
Storyline of this play, “The Visit"
succeeds in being quite amusing in
parts and fully entertaining.
Diirrenmatt himself calls the play a
"tragic comedy.” There are several
comedic characters, such as Claire‘s
endless parade of suitors, the alco-
holic school teacher and the blind
twins Koby and Loby.

The Grinncll College Theater De-
partment has made a wise choice in
choosing to present such a unique
play. “The Visit" is sure to be both
lhoughleprovoking and entertaining.

Whoa! Could it be? Could the

ing, “...and hopefully the last."

But give 'em a chance. These four
guys from Iowa City will be sewing
up their own brand of funk metal

Described by Paul Wicser as "some
guys I got drunk with once," Heads
On The Wall have graced Iowa City
and Des Moines for the past coupla
ycars,starting outasacovcrbandand
now playing their own tunes. They
have survived a name change and a
lineup change, and perform regularly
at clubs like The Runaway despite
being students at Iowa and ISU.

Acouplaotherstudean,Grinnell's
own Phallusy,will be opening up for
them, so be sure and swing by the
Hanis Center this Friday at 10:00

"An Evening With William Allen White"

Biographical performance in Flanagan Arena Theatre

"An Evening With William Allen
While," a oncrman biographical play
by Robert Dcwey, will be held
Wednesday and Thursday, April 15-
16, at 8:00 pm. in Flanagan Arena
Theatre.

The play pays homage to the late
William Allen White, the Pulitzer
Prizerwinrting Kansas newspaper-
man. Dewey calls White “a prairie
philosopher. the voice of the Mid
west, the quintessential American."

Dewey, a California playwright
and actor and a former Grinnell resi»
dent, grew up in Emporia, Kansas,
where White edited the Emporia Ga-
zette. Dewey has researched White's
career and read most of the editor‘s
writing: “I hope to bring him into the
national consciousness in the same
category as Mark Twain or Will
Rogers,” explains Dewey.

White wrote 23 books and hun-
dreds of magazine articles and re-
mained editor of theEmporia Gazette
for 49 years. The play runs about an
hour and 30 minutes with three pans:
White’s rise to fame, his role as one
of the Midwest’s mostinﬂucntial jour-
nalists, and his later years.

Dewey, who retired to alifomia
in 1989, is an ordained minister and
servedasministerofGrinnell‘sUnited
Church of Christ (Congregational).
He also served Congregational
churches in Michigan andNew York,
and for two years he and his wife
lived in South India, where he was
chaplain of a school for missionary
children. From 1967 until his retire-
ment, Dewey was dean of the chapel
at Kalamazoo College in Michigan.

Throughout these years, Dewey
says that he never forgot his love for

acting. He has directed plays, taken
roles, and been involved in a number
ofcollcgcand community theatrcpro-
ductions.

“I‘ve always felt that religion and
drama were two sides of a coin,“
Dewey explains. “Both deal with the
meaningoflifeandtheultimateques- '
tions of life and death. Good liturgi- .
cal religion is great drama, And great
drama is ultimately religious because '
it asks us why we are here.“

Babe Voertman, assistant profesr ,
sor of theatre atGrinnell College, has
acameo role in the production, which
is being sponsored by the Rosenfield
Program in Public Affairs, Intcma-
tional Relations, and Human Rights,
and the Public Events Committee at
Grinncll College. .

Tickets are available at no charge
at the door.
