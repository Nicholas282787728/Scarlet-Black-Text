Joint Board votes to ban smoking
SGA moves one step closer to a non-smoking Forum '

BY NGOC L01
Staff Writer

In a 1378 vote Wednesday evening,
With 3 abstentions, the Joint Board of the
Student GovernmentAssociation voted in
support of a possrble ban on smoking in
the Forum. The ruling will not be ﬁnal
until it is signed by Pamela Ferguson, who
will review the SGA decision next week.

The debate about whether to allow
smoking in the Forum has been long and
heated. Last semester, the issue was brought
before the Joint Board by the Committee
on Student Life, buta decision was delayed
until an alternative to North Lounge could
be provided for smokers. In the quest for
such an alternative, Tom Crady, Dean of
Student Affairs, provided funds to allow
Bob’s Underground to open from 12:30
pm. to 4:30 p.m. in addition to the

A ban on smoking in North Lounge
would make Central campus entirely smoke~
free and would leave Bob’s and some dorr
mitory lounges as the only public places on
campus where smoking is allowed.

Originally. smoking was allowed in
both the Forum Grille and North Lounge.
Last spring, after complaints about smoke
were lodged by Grille employees. smok-
ing was conﬁned to North Lounge only.
Jenny Erickson, director of the Forum,
said she has continued to receive com-
plaints about smoke.

The presentation of Bob’s as an alter-
native smoking site raises concerns for
opponents of the possible Forum ban. For
one thing, the coffeehouse always has had
a smoking section and is not a new alter
native, said John Chodacki ’98,

“Bob’s is already a designated smok-
ing area and is not an academic setr
ting," Chodacki said.

In addition, students living offrcam-
pus and faculty who smoke will be in
conveniencod because Bob's is not as
centrally located as the Forum, Chodacki
presented a petition in opposition of the
ban at Wednesday’s meeting. The peti-
tion stated that the Forum “is a place for
professors and students to discuss course
work and for students to take study breaks
from Burling Library.” By banning smoke
ing, it said, the Forum’s accessibility will
be limited and there will no longer be an
indoor smoking area convenient to all
Grinnellians. The petition contained 85
signatures and included students and fac-
ulty, smokers and non-smokers.

For those who don‘t like being around
smoke, a ban on smoking in the North
Lounge would be a relief. Even though
smoking currently is not allowed during
scheduled events in the lounge, propo~
nents of the ban said that the smell of

smoke lingers and often discourages or
prevents people from attending events.

“It’s not fair [for smokers] to have to
go to Bob’s." said Michelle Dean ‘00,
“but I also don‘t think [the current situa-
tion is} fair for people who are allergic to
smoke and who want to go to movies and
lectures in the Forum."

In addition, the lounge‘s ventilation
system cannot operate successfully un-
less doors between the Forum's game
room and the lounge are open. With open
doors, however, smoke bothers gamers
and noise from the game room bothers
smokers who are studying. Occasionally,
when people smoke in the TV alcove to
the north ofthe lounge where smoking is
not allowed, the smoke ﬁlters into admin~
istrative ofﬁces below.

”It’s a sign of the times," Erickson said.
”Now you can't smoke in the airport or
other public places...it’s a student decision."

News In Brief
Mountain Goats sited at Bob’s

The eveing was nearly over last Friday night at Bob‘s
Underground Coffeehouse’s open mic night when Kevin
Rich ‘97. Bob’s manager asked the audience ifthere was
anyone left in the house who wanted to perform. The sole
member of the band the Mountain Goats stepped forward
and said that ifthere was a guitar for him, he would play.
He preceded. according to Rich, “to blow the audience
away.”

Rich was so impressed with'The Mountain Goats that
he booked him immediately for a performance this Satur»
day night at 10:30pm. According to Theo Bott ‘99, Bob’s
assistant manager, the Mountain Goats “aren't similar
enough to any other artist to be classiﬁed. I'd say he’s a
folky rock and roll artist. His sound is acoustic guitar with
vocals.“

The band, whose only member is dating a Grinnell
College student, just retumed in November from a three
month tour of the United States and Europe. The Mounr
tain Goats have four albums out and a ﬁfth is about to be
released. Admission is free and Bob's will be serving its
usual menu items.

Space fills agenda in
Board of Trustees meeting

BY MAX JULIAN MULLER
Staff Writer

150 Grinnell students stood stood absolutely silent
holding hands in the cold on February 7. The line of
students stretched east from the Forum, then south along
the side of Mears Cottage, running along the path the
members of the Board of Trustees followed after their
second meeting ofthe school year at Grinnell House.

SGA president Rupin Thakkar ‘97 and vice presi-
dent Trevor Porath ‘97 presented the issue of the need
for space for student organizations to the Board of Trust-
ees at the meeting. The line of students demonstrated
student support of this issue to the trustees.

The issue ofmultteultural space has been presented
to the Board of Trustees before. according to Rupin,
but never met with a favorable response. In years past,
the Board has turned down several plans to increase
multicultural space on campus. One proposal suggested
that houses around the borders of campus be reserved
for members ofthe different cultural groups. The Board

dents’ lives. Their number has grown, and they are much
greater contributors to student activities and the rich-
ness of student life. The Forum is the geographic center
of the campus. Havmg student groups located so ad-
vantageously would truly make it the center of campus
life and fulﬁll its purpose of serving as the “campus
living room". Thakkar also mentioned the possibility of
moving the post office to the Forum. Thakkar said that
the present location of the post ofﬁce was meant to be
temporary. Moving the post ofﬁce to the Forum with
the student groups would cause all campus communi-
cation to originate from a single, central location.

Members ofthe Space Committee met with three of
the trustees to discuss the space issue on February 6.
The committee included student leaders of the college’s
multicultural groups, a student representative. and seve
eral college administrators. According to Thakkar, this
meeting was a huge success, Thakkar said that when he
and Poralh made the formal proposal before the Board
of Trustees the next day. they already had three allies
from the previous meeting in the audience.

Studentsformed a silent chain spanningfrom the Forum to Mears Cottage to
demonstrate the importance of multicultural space to the Board of Trustees.

disapproved of this option because they feared that sepa-
rate housing for cultural groups would have the side
effect of segregating the campus.

The presentation put before the board this time was
different, The issue is no longer about cultural space,
rather it is space for student groups in general. Curr
renlly, there are over 115 officially recognized student
groups on campus, while only three student organiza~
tions have suitable office space. The remaining organi-
zations are only allotted a maximum of halfa file cabi-
net drawer apiecc in the SGA office. The space is so
limited that groups must reapply for their spot in the
file cabinet each year.

Poralh and Thakkar presented a plan that would solve
this problem. They wish to expand the Forum to create
office space for Grinnell student groups.

According to its brochure, the Forum is meant to
serve as “the ‘living room’ of the campus. It was de—
signed as an educational building, positively extending
what goes on in the classroom.” Porath says that in the
19605, when the Forum was built, ll. served its purpose
well. Campus life was different then, with student life
more centered around dorms. Students lived in the same
dorm for four years and dorms were the source of stu-
dents’ identity and activities.

Today student organizations play a larger role in slu-

At the board meeting, Thakkar and Porath showed
slides of the current accommodations for campus groups.
They showed the three file cabinets vied for by over a
hundred campus groups and the closet sized former
PDRs presently allocated to the multicultural groups.
The rooms must serve as the ofﬁces of the group lead-
ers and adwsors, as storage space and as a meeting area.
The presentation also included video clips from last
semester's rally for more multicultural space. The clips
showed student leaders from Stonewall and Concerned
Black Students speaking ofthe beneﬁts having their own
space. These group leaders testified that the space has
enhanced the groups’ productivity and has had a posi-
tive impact on the Grinnell community.

Thakkar viewed the SGA presentation to the trustees
as a huge success. “We are literally three hundred times
closer to actually building space than we were last year,"
he said. “What this meeting has done” Porath said “is
achieved a philosophical understanding of the need for
more space and communicated to the trustees that there
is student support." This is more progress than has ever
been made before on this issue. Now SGA Will write a
formal proposal for the Board to review. The proposal
will detail the square feet requested and estimate ofthe
total cost ofthe project. The proposal will be reviewed
by the Board for a ﬁnal decision at their next meeting.

AltBreak extends its reach

A record number of destinations

has been announced for spring

BY NGOC L01
Staff Writer

Organizers of Alternative Break completed weeks of
preliminary planning February 6 when they announced a
record number of destinations for community service ops
portunities during Spring Break '97. Four groups of stu
dents will depart from Grinnell to places including New
Mexico, San Francisco, Memphis, Des Moines, Chicago
and Montreal, Quebec. Registration forms are available
at the Community Service Center

“Alternative Break has never planned this many trips
for a single break before," said organizer Kevin
McGoldrick ‘99.

Hopeful student participants at the February 6 meeting
deliberated about which trips to register for. Those who
are primarily concerned about the environment will travel
to volunteer for one week at the Nature Conservancy in
New Mexico. They will spend a second week working at
a San Francisco soup kitchen.

A second group will embark on a trip to Memphis and
the Land Between the Lakes for a week volunteering in
various capacities and another week camping and work
ing for Tennessee’s Parks Department.

Urban service opportunities in lesbian/gay rights,
women's rights and AIDS organizations will he the focus
ofa third group’s Venture to Chicago and Montreal.

A ﬁnal group will spend spring break volunteering in
Des Moines and at Iowa’s Winnebago reservation.

Alternative Break has come a long way in a short time.
organizers said. Just a few years ago, Alternative Break
operated under the auspices of Poverty Action Now, then
known as Students Helping the Homeless. Miles Stern
‘96 is credited with coordinating the ﬁrst Alternative Break
trip to Arizona and San Francisco to combine environ
mental and social service work. Only two students pare
ticipated in that initial trip. Since then. Alternative Break
trips have garnered mass student interest in a wtde variety
of destinations and service opportunities.

Although organizers have managed to keep costs at a
minimum for participants. finding funding for the trips
continues to be challenging, McGoldrick said. Last year.
three Alternative Break trips cost a total of $5,100, That
amount is expected to increase this year. The Student Gov-
ernment Association and the administration provide some
money, but students also must coordinate bake sales and
basketball fundraisers and apply for grants from churches
and organizations like United Way,

Organizers try to strike a balance between keeping trips
affordable and allowing a fair number of students to para
ticipate, said Amy Eilert of the Grinnell College Commur
nity Service Center, Only about so students out ofdozens
who apply will be accepted to participate in this year’s
Alternative Break.

“(The problem is trying to] maintain the integrity of
the program while allowing for as many students to go
who want to go," Eilert said.
