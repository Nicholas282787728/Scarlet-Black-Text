Jobless leaders look at

_Bella's mouth to where we are.

Who's next? Having heard that
President Turner is resigning, that
question immediately came to
mind. The announcement
evidently took faculty and students
by surprise. so I thought this is my
chance to get a work in before
names start ﬂying. Responding to
Fritz Maytag‘s recent request for
help, the following is a short list of
candidates I have prepared for the
faculty and the board of trustees.
They are listed in rapidly declining
order of preference.

Bella Ahzug: Recently unem-
ployed, this woman tops the list
due to her considerable experience
in public affairs. She would also
give the college‘the opportunity to
put its affirmative action money
where its mouth is, and bring

our rumpus i toward our reliow
Chl‘l'fli‘tl l tunes like these
when for too many people can only
bring then elves to say of our
squirrel o. they taste
like Cllll‘htlll. l‘cdlly '

Tilly's gone; it‘s too late for him.
But perhaps this experience will
bring us all closer in some
way And maybe some of you will
drop a solemn handful ol acorns
near ARH Tilly would like that,
don't you think7

Angela Davis: Again near the
top of the list for afﬁrmative action
reasons, which compliment her
long involvement in the public
sector. She would be especially
valuable as president, however,
due to her past display of behind-
lhescenes organizational ability.

Betty Ford: Another talented
woman. she has seen first hand
just what a president can and
cannot do. She might well decline
though, if her spouse feels the icy
Winter sidewalks would not
provide sure footing.

Mailamo Mao: A first lady who
almost achieved tirst-person
status, she would certainly bolster
the nascent Asian Studies
department. Besides, if wall
posters can be believed, by giving
the Madame the nod, Grinnell

THE PREMIERE work is a
vintage one by the cleverest of
filmmakers. its story is as close as
the master ever comes to
producing a true mystery, but by
the end, suspense, nut mystery, is
the overriding concern. This is an
oft-employed technique of the
director: the “Magul'iin.” the
