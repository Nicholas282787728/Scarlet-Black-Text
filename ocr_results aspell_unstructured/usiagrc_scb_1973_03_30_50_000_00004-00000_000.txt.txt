by Rich Arnold

The imal games oi the 1973 in-
tramural basketball season were
played in the form oi the biggest
and best lM tourney in years. As
expected, Off Campus breezed th-
rough as the Vlctors to cap an un-
beaten season. They were opposed
by a team consisting oi all stars
from the other teams in the league
in the finals.

In the opening round oi the tour
hey West Norris I trounced Cowles
78-37 to advance to the semi-finals,
Their opponent turned out to be none
other than East Norris which gain-
ed a berth in the semi-finals by de—
feating Younkers 43—35, Haines bliv
tzed the Profs 50731 thereby getr
ting the privilege oi iacing on
Campus in the semi-iinals. oc rol»
led over Loose by a lopsided score
of 71-38,

Semi—final action had West Norris
I edging neighboring East Norris
50»43 on the strength of Jeff Fal»
lon’s 23 points. Off Campus had
about the only tough game of their
season against Haines as they only
won by 13points,66753. Dennis Moss
paced oc with 23 points.

In the finals the IM basketball
hierarchy decided that West Norris
i should be replaced by an all star
team. They were replaced, butsome
question lingered as to whether the
replacement was an all star team.
They were a team, however sowe’ll
leave it at that.

The big game started off with a
loud controversy over who would be
shirts and who would be skins.
Off Campus, obviously bashful a~
bout their rundown physiques, adam~
antly refused to be skins as did
the All Stars. Finally the All Stars
relented and the game was on. The
first quarter was close, as Off

Campus led 15710 at its conclu-
sion.

In the second quarter on Cam-
pus exploded ior 32 points and
bolted to a 47-23 halitime lead.
or: had three men in double fi~
gures by the hall, Bill Bailey had
13 points and Dennis Moss and
Rico Williams each had 12.

The second halt saw the All Stars
begin to shrink Off Campus lead,
but midway through the third quar»
ter Off campus took control again.
Three turnovers in a row led to
three quick on Campus baskets
and they were an and running 217
gain. The third quarter ended with
on campus comlortably atop a 67-

50 score,
The men of Off Campus outscored

the tired All Stars 29 to 12 in the

fourth quarter and won going away.

At the final buzzer Off Campus
was a 95-60 winner. Bill Bailey
led all players with 30 points idle
lowed by Rico Williams' 20 and
Dennis Moss’ 19 tallies. High sc-
orer for the All Stars was Nick
Williams with 12 points. Also for
the All Stars, Dave Gitlin collected
11, Bob Arnold 5, Chip Hall and
Mike Grejbowski 8 apiece, and Ted
Cardwell 6,

Off Campus was last seen trotting
off to St, Louis to prepare for some
small basketball tourney that was
going to be played there. One oi
the 0C players was muttering some-
thing about Phll or Bill Walton or
something like that as he was lear

Squash

The whole Grinnell communitywar
its in anguished suspense for the
outcome oi today's championship qu
uash match between Professors
Guroff and Lalonde, limmytheore-
ek's official Las Vegas line has La-
londe an 11-1 odds on favorite.
My money’s on Guroff, It has to
beerl've got him for a class,

Pool

1. M. Chairman Tim Goldbuff has
not as yet Commenced with the pool
tournament, as there is some con-
sensus for adding a dollar incentive
(presumably of more than a dollar)
to the tourney. Goldbuff says that
this will probably be organized dur—
ing the coming week.

Softball

Goldbuff announced this week that
IM softball is in the works and will

be starting very shortly. At this
time he is searching ior umpires.
All able»b0died. quickrthinking,
glib-talking, prospective “men in
blue” should contact Goldbuff at x—
324. He would like two oiiiclals ior
each game. Asusual, umpires,there
will be a $1 reward ior each time
you make it through a whole game,

Handball

in semirfinal play Tom Kalhcrn
will play John Pape and two fresh—
men, Brent Schondelmeyer and Tim
Havens, will go ior thehands. Watch
next weeks She for the exciting
results.

Paddleball

Paddleball drags on, with two
games yet to be played in the third
round of eliminations. The unplayed
matches pair Hugh Magee and Jerry
Lalonde, and Brad Vazales and Steve
Carroll. Tom Kalorn, who won by
a forfeit, and Jon Hechler, who whip-
ped this reporter shortly beforebp
eak, have already qualitiedioriourth
round semi-final competition.

Women’s I.M.s

Ellen Grady, 197243 I.M Chairs
woman, recently attempted to start
a women's paddleball tournament.
Her announcement in the Campus
Memo brought no response, This was
another in a series of failures to
generate women’s interest in sports.
Although this is partially explained
by the rise of women’s volleyball,
swimming and bowling teams, most
women obviously just do not care.
"I’ve tried everything,” Grady told
this reporter, I M, volleyball found
no support first semester and only
three women wanted to play basket
ball.

I.M, competition lined up for the
iinal quarter oi the academic year
includes a one—day badmintontourr
hey and women’s softball.

by Andy Bloom

The Grinnell tennis team, after
conducting its iirst week of prac-
tice, is eyeing a conference title,
hoping to unseat last year's confer

pears good, with returning varsity
players Brad Vazalas (last year's
conierence champ), Neal Trabish,
Dave Beeman (most valuableplay-
er), Peter Doerlng, Ricky Kellar,
and Andy Bloom. This year’sfresh»
men players should also provide
the team with depth.

present squad to be stronger than
that or last year, which iinished
2nd in conference. He commented
to this reporter that the team she
ould iinish among the top three in
the Midwest Conference.
