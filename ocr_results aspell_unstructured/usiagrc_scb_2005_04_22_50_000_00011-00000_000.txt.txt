Why President Mark Henry must be impeached

We demand the immediate impeachment of Mark Henry,
our President, followed swiftly by his arrest and imprison-
mentl

I-lis “random rant" last week condemning the streakers
epitomizes the stupidityrmaskedtasrdiplomacy that threatens
to overrun our well—intentioned campus dialogues.

Mr. Henryvaliantly defends the right to run naked—within
certain limits, ofcoursc. These proper limits are breached, he
suggests, (1) when groups ofoutgoiirg nudists exceed the tem
perate number, twenty, (2) when the unclothed body invades “a
place of’eating,"and (3) wiren the loathsome sight ofa human
form, pubic hair and all. is forced upon those who are opposed
to it, for love of God or Virtue.

Mr. Henry tactfully labels the streakers’ sin a violation of
“freedom": the freedom to streak is rro longer valid when it
infringes upon another's freedom not to have you streak. If
properly compartmentalized, however, the freedom to sneak
violates no other freedoms and is, therefore, perfectly accepte
able. Performed at a foreplanned time and place, institution-
ally sanctioned, with a budget approved for chips and salsa,
streaking is excellent. Everyone should have fun at collegel
Cornpartmentalize life, our President declares, and all free
doms can coexist in harmonious mutual exclusivityl Sex in

‘Intifada’ evokes hate

To the edrtor:

Four days ago, in the spirit of self-governance, I along with
other concerned members of the Jewish community met With the
leaders ofthe Palestinian Solidarity Group to discuss the Grinnell
network usernirme [intifada]. Frrst, let me clearly state thatI have
no issue with a Palestinian Solidarity Group on campus, and l feel
that it will provide a great medium to share ideas However, it is
my opinion that the term is highly odious to those who support
ofborh sides of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. In turn,I asked the
group leaders to change the usemame.

In 1987 and 2000, the PLO declared an intifada against Israel.
The ultimate result of this action was thousands of deaths on each
side as the cycle ofviolcncc only hampered the pcacc processTo
ignore this history would be denying the rare iratuie ofthe word.

The leaders of the PSG have made it clear to lire that they
have rro intention ofchanging their user-name as I am apparently
a product of social constructs and do not understand the classic
meaning of the word (uprising). At this point I have to trues»
tion the priorities of the P56. Is it more important to change
the social construction of a word, or to discuss Middle East pcace
proccss in a beneficial manner? Assuming the motivations ofthis
group are the latter, how constructive is it to the dialogue ofboth
sides to keep a name that is seen as volatile and offensive to merri-
bers ofthe campus community?

Even irone lieu-s “intii‘ada"aiid thinks “uprising," the reality is
that the term has developed into an expressron oflrate.1n my eyes,
the group is no better than those who display a corrfedemte ﬂag to
assert southern heritage. That flag, and this usernamc, have dcvclr
oped into asymbol ofignorance, intolerance id violence, How
can people have a balanced discussion of the Middle East, when
this group is intrr-ni ting those with an opposing viewpoint?

They have all the right to help reform the popular meaning
ofintifada; 1 just ask that they do it within the comch of their
group meetings Keeping this username is not a political struggle,
but merely spitting in the face of campus solidarity, As a student
who is very interested in discussing the Middle East peace pro-
cess,l would never disgmcc the memories of Israelis and Palestin-
inns who have died in the Intifada by associating myscltwith this
group. If you are friends with leaders of the Palestinian Solidart
ity Group, please encourage them to be more understanding of
the sentiments of concerned members of the campus community.
Sincerely,

This is nauseating, ifnot simply boring. What Mark Henry
means by “respecting diversity” is securing a
community devoted to the right not to be

‘Intifada’ signifies
struggle, solidarity

Dear $813 editors

We, students of Grinnell College, have formed the Paley
tinian Solidarity Group to gather voices on campus to speak in
solidarity with Palestinian selfrdctcrmination,

Our first action as ii group was to invite Ali Abunimah to
campus. Mr. Abunimah is an internationally recognized joiire
nalist and corfotrnder ofthe website “Electronic Intifada." He
spoke Wednesday evcning in Main Lounge; the title orhis talk
was “Palestine/Israel: 15 Peace Really About to Break Out?"
We would like to thank everyone who attended this inaugural
event.

\Nc would like to
formally address cont
ccriis voiced by several
students regarding our
Plan handle and ITS
riser name, "iruifada,"

The term was used
on two different posters
advertising Mr. Abun-
imah’s talk, and sparked some confusion

To be Clear: the Palestinian Solidarity Group rot an
milksemluc organization. Denotativcly, “intifidit' signifies
the Palestinian people's struggles for self-determination and
freedom {tom the illegal military occupation ofthe West Bank
and Gaza

This struggle has had both peaceful and violent manifest
tations, and to reduce it to the actions of some radical fringe
groups is both ignorant and offensive to pro-Palestinians ev-
crywlrcre,

Moreover, we feel that it is very important to maintain
the distinction that a prorPalestinian position is not an antit
Semitic one. A reading of the word “intifada,” the struggle
for Palestinian selfedctermination, as anti-Semitic effectively
equates all prorPalestiiiian positions with anti-semitism.

Therefore, we are choosing to keep “inrifada” as our e-mail
address and Plan handle in order to confront antl subvert this
myth, a myth that limits discourse and hence understanding.

current environment of irritability—these variations are almost
always bearable, if not hilarious, ifnot spiritually uplifting.

Clarifying [solid]'s intent

Dear Grinnell,

Along with a number of other students I have devoted sign
nifrcant timc during the past two weeks to getting a little group
iGrinnellians for Solidaritypoff the ground. It distresses me
that we have done a poorjob communicating our purpose to the
campus community. 1 would like to apologize and go some way
toward rectifying that,

Asl see it, [solid] was never supposed to be an organized, dist
ciplined group with a specific set ofproposed actions,brit rather a
conduit for student concerns about campus community.

Those concerns, as I've seen them expressed by number of
students (and as I have ctprcsscd them), run something like
this:

1. We would like to see the people who manage our campus
treating students and student concerns (and perhaps the cons
ccr'us of other groups on campus) with more respect- more as
fcllow community members than as clients or as children, There
has been a breakdown of trust such that a significant number of
students simply don’t trust that the administration is acting in
good faitliwcven when they are.

2. We would like to see more administrative openness. Too
often, students feel lll’lnforn‘md about policy changes on cams
pus. This leads to more ofpioblein (1).

3. WC would like to see students showing a little more soli-
darity, a little more trust, and maybe even a little more loyalty
towards each other.

I think that a group llke [solid] can get to these concerns
by getting involved in more immediate campus issuer-diversity,
budgetary planning, vandalism, security activity, student fear--
whcre thcsc three concerns are a fundamental part of the probe
lem.

If you are also worried about these three FSlICS’TbBCiIUSC of
recent events on campus or because of a longrterm problemﬁl
encourage you to get in touch with [solid]t Ityou think there
are more pressing issues to be worried aboutr-oryou [lunk we’re
going about things in the wrong way~1 encourage you to get in
touch with [solid]. 1 pretty much just encourage you to get in
touch with [solid].
