the scarlet and black

A breath of fresh air

As we left the Chicago area and ventured
into the armpit ofthe country (a.k.a. the Mid-
west), I began to feel a bit panicked at the vast
expanse oftlat nothingiicss. I couldn't actually
tell if the car was moving because it all looked
the same. Granted, I'm from Michigan, so it
wasn’t that big ofa change, but Michigan has a
big lake with a beach, so we win,

It didn't help that my mother was continu—
ally asking me what in the world possessed me
to go to school in the middle of Iowa. We livc
in a country of varied environments and clir
mates, many ofwhieh are gorgeous, and 1 had
chosen corn capital ofthc world.

But my response to her
incessant antagonizing was
easy: “Grrnnell’s in Iowa,
shut up, IVlnm.” (In a nice
tone of voice, of coursc;
she a paying a hell of a lot
or money for me to romp
arourtd in the middle of net
where.)

At first it bothered me
that my answer to the qucstron,“50 wher are
you going to collegei" elicited many a “Hit
But soon I realized that one ofthc many beaur
ties of Grrnnell is that no one here gives a
damn that not everyone has heard of Grin-
hell, that we’re not on the East coast, tlrat our
school mascot is not a color (a la the Big Green
ofDartmouth).

I'm going to have a fabulous time and get
a great education and no one will even know
about it! And then it wrll be fun to beat every-
one at everything intellectual.

My ﬁrst few days here were a jumble of
meeting people and immediately forgetting

Ppened to me

I have this feeling that
in four years,
will have been the best
thing that ever hap-

their irarnes, wandering ’
in the loggia ( How
the hell do you spell
that?" was my ﬁrst
question) and
absolutely

loving the
feeling
of being
free. Not
in the sense of, Lets do anything and everw
thing that we can because we ve been repressed
for 18 vtars ofour life, but a calming, respect-
ful freedom that I hadnt felt bcforc.

That feeling intensified
throughout the next couple
ofdavs, with the erceptioii
of feeling obligated to go
to various NSO events. (It’s
hard to ignore is years of
rigorous obedience train-
ing.)

I have never lived in a
community where people ctr
existed peacefully simply by respecting cach
other and themselves. I have never been in a
place where everyone cared desperately about
something and worked so hard to change the
world in some way. it is a breath offtcsh air
for me,

In short, I feel like Griitncll is a place
where I can finally grow up. Yes, I am a typical
first year walking around with a confused look
on my fact only knowrng where five buildings
are and still thinking all the squirrels are novel
and cute, But I have this feeling that in four
years, Grinnell will have been the best thing
that ever happened to me.

Missing the old Grinnell

After a tcnrhour drive across Colorado,
Nebraska and Iowa, all I really wanted to do
when I got to my new dorm room was fall over
on the mattress, no matter how gmdy it was,
and pass out.

Fortunately, my roommate mauled me bur
tore I got the chancel didn't evtn get to open
the door before her adorable, ccr
static face poked itselfout of thc
darkness and we commenced
ten solid minutes of “Al-ll-ll I
MISSED YOU!"

“Oh ycs,"I thought.“This year
is going to be awesome,"

I had been looking forward
to this moment for more or ‘
less the three months since
all my friends left to go
back to their homes and
families (or wherever the
heck people go {or vacation
when they don't do summer
research), After spending three weeks back in
the wilds of the Denver suburbs, I was {let}
nitcly ready to be back.

Ahli, all those fond rnemol rcs ofsclf-govcr—
trance and southern Express and the wonder»
ful debauchery to be had on old Norris Fourth.
I was sure this year would he evcn bone

but wait, what happened to the c ell

people I don‘t know on my new ﬂoor? What

Why is Forum pizza being sold two slices to a
box? My god, theres no smokilw i the rooms

I'm beginning to warty that perhaps Ivc
lost my mind. Was my utopian vision ofGrinr
nell last year merely a pipe dream induced by
spending time with parental rcgulat again?
Perhaps I'm overreacting. Maybe the
changes to the Forum and thc abolrtion of
Southern Express aren't really such a brg
deal after rill. It could be that classes rc~
ally crejust as big last year and thc
' rig halls just as crowded, and I
just didn't notice. And maybe
administration really did
won-y about little strin'
last year, and I just never
got caught.
or course, I was only
here for one year. Perhaps last year was w rd,
and it's like this all the time. Brit something
about this new Grinncll that has taken the
place of my dreams ofthe “good old days" just
doesn't l’ccl right.

a little time, I can adjust to the dining fac .

awesome enough to take the place of my old

the Old Gnnnell a chance to conic back. Brit
Old Grinncll, do me a favor and hurry up.

Not quite grown up

When I arrived as a firstrycar student those
long two years ago,l thought that the third-
year students had it made. They all seemed so

,. old.

I watched the third-year stuclcnts having
discussions about classes, professors and their
summer internships over Subway cups
held with wrist-banded hands. For my
18-ycarrold eyes that was adulthood.
Unlike the jaded and detached seniors
who lived offeampus, the third»ycarsv~
for nibwcrc the pinnacle of what I
wanted from college: grown-up»
tress with a sense or promise
and future.

AsI spend my last days
of August in stickv Iowa
for the0 third trinc, IreallzeI
am not this at all Im not the
gr own-up I hoped to be by the
ripe old age of 20.

Still,I am also not the widereyed isryoarr
old that ﬁrst came here, I ([0th think that that
selfwould even recognize me now. The retired
high school athlete would probably be surprised
at the intercollegiate competition that was
never supposed to happen, Thc once insecure
and awkward teenager would stand in awe of
my comfort level with coed bathrooms. public
nudity and hard alcohol, The kitclionrshy girl
would probably be ﬂatrout amazed at the col—
lection of pot, pan and rolling pin that I have

L A GARCIA

come to call my own, I would like to think she

would be a little impressed by my academic vo-

cabulary. And 1 know she would be absolutely

shocked to see the small, but teal, diamond ring

promising me to a young man she finds very

annoying.

But for all these trappings ofadulthood

thati rrow possess,i enter my thirdrycat

less sure ofmy future than 1 was when

I ﬁrst arrived. I am still without a vir

able rourryear plan or accompllshable

major. I get heart palprtations thinking

about the end of the semester, much

less trying to imagine my lift: ﬁve

years down the road. The once obr

viorrs post—graduation plans

seem both impossible and

unattainable, andifor

the first time* undcs‘rrr

able. My future, rather

than seeming bright and promising, looms like

a firghtcning rebirth over the activities of my
once comfortable college womb.

As 1 come into my third year at Grinnell,I
am less certain of my life direction than 1 ever
was as a tir-srrycar. And now, With CDO emails
and law school applications ﬂitting into my life,
I feel there is a clock ticking in the background
reminding me, thatl need to get somewhere—
anywherhfast. I still do not {ch like a grown-
up ready for the real world, and now, more than
ever,1 miss my mom.
