Editor SCARLET AND BLACK:

I wonder if I may use your organ
m a medium for announcing to the
deluded portion of the public which
reads the Malteaser that my verse is
usually pretty punk, but that I am
aided tremendously in the creation
of metric monstrosities by tempera»
mental typesetters and dizzy proof~
readers who have attained a profici-
ency in garhling words and lines
which I with my inherent limitations
will never he able to approach.

I believe anyone, even a college
student, can understand what an
omitted word or a transposed line can
do to a thing that is supposed to have
rhyme and meter. I plead guilty to
the crimes I have committed, hut I
believe I should he cxcuipated from
the grosser sins contributed by typo-
graphers and proofreaders.

Respectfully,
Stan Hipp.

o, E. Niffnegger. of the Crinnell
High school faculty, will speak Sun-
day evening in the League room of
the Methodist church on the subject
“Religion for Young People."

Mr. Niffnegger was formerly pres-
ident of the Des Moines Epworth

aging director of the United Play-
