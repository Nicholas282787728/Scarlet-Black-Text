always been rhe («so In 1974, controversy over the campus
pct policy, speciﬁcally leash laws, resulted in the reinstatement
of mandatory leushing ordo-gs on campus after a monrhrlong
moratorium on the policy.

Photo of the
Week

oore

Pride week: The drag show was
amazing, one of many reasons to
be proud.

 

 

ARH fire: Got out of class, but only
for 15 minutes (we’re glad every-
one’s OK).

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court: Chipping away at
choice definitely deserves at least
one thumbs down.

 

Spring rant list

1) It's Spencer Grill, not Spencer Grille.
Enough faulty spelling!

2) Congratulations, Class of’07. If nothing
else, your class Ccrtninly will have the bust comr
incucemcnt speaker orthcm all. I fully intend to
stay for commencement to hear Angela Davis
speak, and everyone else should bloody well do
likewise! >

3) Now that the college has set its eyes on
opening businesses in G—town,what about opens
ing a discothcquc?What about a hookah bar? An
Indian restaurant? A goekart arena? A records
store? Ah indeed, the college can single-hand-
edly lrhnsform this sad Midwestern village with
too many churches into yet another eclectic my,
lugs town.

4) spring come quick!

More puns needed on campus

Samuel Johnson said that puns are the lowest
term othunior. But, quite frankly, poetry is much
vcrsc. The punners, granted, should be drawn and
quoted for their crimes. But, those who don't enjoy
puns should be pun-ishcd by being forced to listen
to equinerrelated puns until your voice is hoarse.
Here are some suggestedjumping otl‘ punts before
you dive in: .

A Show me a piano falling down a mineshaft
and I'll show you A-ﬂat minor.

, What would Islam be without Mohammed?
A non—prophet organization.

- What's the definition oft: will? (Come on, it's
a dead giveaway!) .

- How many electricians does it take to screw in
a light bull)? A whulc watt.

Sorry guys, but a pun is just a rare medium well—
done. Time to step it up!
