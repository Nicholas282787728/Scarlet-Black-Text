‘Refreshing’ Describes Piano Recital
by Poldi Mildner, According to ‘Critic

Eighteen-Year Old Artist

Reveals ‘Eagel‘ Vision
of Life' Friday

By H. w. MATLACK

Eastern critics have garlanded
Foldl Mildner with most of the hand-
some adjectives that the dictionaries
afford, but they have overlooked the
one which perfectly describes her per-
formance at Herrick chapel last
night, That is the word "refreshing."

We can take it for granted nowhr
days, in a. world cumbercd with ac—
comphshed pianists, that any per-
former, young or old, who undertakes
a concert tour is equipped with corn-
pleta command of the instrument
from a technical point of view, and
has a wellrrtlundetl repertoire of
masterpieces, and moreover offers

an individuality to whom it is worth'

while to listen. So it bccomcs nec-
essaz' to discriminate between per—
sonsli es. After all, music means
only what the performer makes it
say to us, and it can't say anything
the performer hasn’t got.
Adolescent Vision

Poldi Mildner's special contribution
at this early stage of her career is a
fresh and eager vision of life re-
vealed through music. It is an adol-
escent vision, full of wonder, not yet
caught up in the storm and stress
which is, alas, through Adam's fall,

the lot of mankind, even of charm-
ing young pianists.

Her first encore number, Schubert’s
“Hark, hark the lark at heav’n‘s
gatc Singsl”, that lovely aubade elab-
orated for the piano by Franz Liszt,
ought to be Poldi’s theme-song. Her
piano-playing is like a lark singing,
“while winking mary-bnds begin to
ope’ their wondering eyes," and she
looked like a msrigold herself all in
pale blue and gold.

Musical Growth

Now Poldi is growing up fast,
musically. There can be no doubt of
that. Any of us who may have the
opportunity to hear her play ngaiilv
and we all should hope for itvin a
year or two will observe a profound
change She will gain in authority
as she loses her naivctc. Every now
and then, last night, she secmed
startled at what she got out of thc
piano. (1n somc respects this was
not surprising, for the battlescarrcd
old veteran Steinway of the Shrine
auditorium that they sent down from
Des Moines didn’t. always return the
perfect answer. and the bench
squeuked an cbbligato that would
have sent a nervous player into (its)

Poldi, always unrufflcd, scorned to
glow in unanticipated splendor as
her music swept along, like a girl
driving a. big new car for the first
time. She seems to be testing out
her own power, and to sec new and
glorious regions of expression wait-
ing to be explored.

Woman Journalist,
Stresses Opportunities for Coeds

Washington Correspondent
Entertained With Group
of Students at Tea

A promi ng future for women in
journalism is the prediction of Mrs.
Orville Routt, nce Mary Patterson.
‘03, Washington correspondent for a
number of California newspapers,
who was gucst of honor at a tea in
the home of President and Mrs.
John S. Nollen this afternoon, and
who returned last fall from a four
month sojourn in England. Germany,
Russia and other European countries.

Mrs. Routt, whose husband is a
trustee of the college, is spending the
weekend in Grinnell on her way from
her home in Hollywood, Calif, to
Washington, D. C., where she will
write a daily column for the Califor-
nia newspapers and possibly for a
feature syndicate.

High Ranking Frosh

students at the tea included
members of the Grinnell chapters of
Sigma Delta Chi and Theta Sigma
Phi, journalistic organizations for
men and women; the Council of
House Presidents, and the Women's
Self Government league, and the 23
highest ranking freshman men and
women of the school.

Mrs. Routt, in an interview Fri-
day, stressed the opportunities for
women in journalism, and advised
that for general newspaper work,
study and training in economics and
political history were of major impor-
tance. Economics is particularly
important, she said, “because little
as we may like to admit it, we are
entering a type of socialism right
now."

Guest of Mrs. Roosevelt

Her journalistic experiences at
Washington and in Germany and Rus-
sia are vivid in Mrs. Routt's mind.
At the national capitol she was re-
gularly admitted to press conferences
with both President and Mrs. Roose-
velt, and following her European
trip was a guest of the latter at the

ALUMNUS CONDUCTS TOUR

A ”Students' Vagabond Tour of the
Ear Eas next summer is being or-
ganized by John A. Decker. '21, of
Columbia, Mb The Grinnell alum-
nus was the rcpresentativc at Grin.

after s.u(lyiilg Far Eastern prob
lems at Yale and Columbia universi-
ties was a faculty member of the
"Floating University" world cruise
of 1923-29. teaching the history of

 

China and Japan and international
relations of the Far East.

 

Grinnell Alumna,

Roosevelt estate in Hyde Park, N. Y.

Mrs. Routt's work as a feature
writer brought her in contact with
many of the leading personalities of
the world at the London economic
conference which she attended last
summer.

Dictators?

1 In Germany, she was impressed
with the similar attitude of the people
toward both Hitler and Roosevelt as
“dictators elected by the voice of the
people”, and the feeling of kinship
between the two countries which this
aroused among the Germans.

Her press dispatches from Ger-
many were censored strictly as
was her personal correspondence, she
said.

Back to Kitchen

As one feature of the Hitler gov-
ernment, she revealed, "women were
being sent back into the home from
which they never should have emerg-
ed," according to the ideas of the
German figurehead.
