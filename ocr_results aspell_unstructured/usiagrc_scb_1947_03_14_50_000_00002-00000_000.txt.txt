Sprig Has Cub

Fickle, tantalizing spring is just around
the corner, and is already previewing its
appearance with much show of changeable
weather. This condition has certainly
contributed, to some extent, to the influ-
enza epidemics at the present time in Des
Moines, Dubuque, Boone, and numerous
other Iowa communities

\Grinnell, has thus far, through the pre-
ventive effect of the inoculation program
effected last fall on this campus, avoided
a similar epidemic. However, the period of
immunity guaranteed by these shots is now
expiring, and at the present time several
cases of flue have been reported to the col—
lege health department.

In order to prevent all epidemic on
Grinnell campus, we would like to suggest
a program of voluntary booster shots to
supplement the previous inoculations. These
could be financed ill the same way as tlle
November program. In this way, Grinnele
lians could be kept dry»nosed in the season
of slush, as Well as that of snow.

F. D."s New Deal

Fellow students:

Now that tile hubbub of campus poli-
tics has died down, you are no doubt looking
back, as I am, over the activities of the
past two weeks with a feeling of wonder—
ment. Months ago, you were probably be-
ginning to wonder if the students of Grille
nell could ever be stilred up over anything.
One undeniable conclusion that must be
drawn from the recent election is that there
exisits a great deal of int st in the col—
lege and campus life. This interest must
continue.

Incorporated in my platform were most
of the changes I thought should be made,
and that there was some chance of making.
through the office of Student Council presi—
dent. I have stated the principle behind the
platform; namely, that with truly repre-
sentative student government we may pro-

gress toward more responsibility for the
individual student. I assume that a major-
ity of you are in agreement with both my
platform and the principle behind it, How-
ever, the student council can do a good job
only if all of you are behind it. I am sure

i'e can accomplish a great deal if as much
zeal is shown during the coming year as
was shown in the past campaign. Already
a li mber of people have presented to me
tliei ideas on how the campus should be
changed. I hope this continues for the resi:
oi the year; I have little doubt that it will.
To those of you who, weeks ago, ex-
1' cssed a ballet in me alld my ideas on
student government; to those who gave so
much of their time and effort to put me
in office; to all of you who have placed
confidence ill me, I wish to extend my sins
cere appreciation. My thanks also to the
editor who made possible this public note
of gratitude.
