Films Committee requests new projector

continued front p.1

Installing a 35mm film projector
would notjust include the purchase
of equipment. The cinema would
need to be updated Willi surround
sound and adequate ventilation
would be necessary. The changes
associated will the Films Coinmite
tee proposals would cost approxi-
mately $40,000. “$40,000 is not a lot
when you look at the fact that they
spend millions on just keeping the
grounds kept up," Saiia said.

Saiia has worked out a temporary
agreement that would allow pre-

scrceniligs of movies if Griiiiiell
College acquires a 35mm projector.
Students would have the opportunity
|o watch ﬁlms and lllcn provrde feed-
back to the production companies
before they are released to the gen
eral public.

The Committee on Student Life
must approve the Films Committee
proposal before anew projector can
become a parrot the total budget
Both groups will be meeting today
as part of the continuing discussion
process regarding the 35mm protec-
tor proposal.

with sociology departments around
the country which are also trying to

recreate their curricula and the pedar
gogy. This convinced us that we are
revising our courses and our ap
proaches to teaching and mentoring
in appropriate ways. We are very
pleased that we have been able to
participate in this innovative grant
but even when the grant is over we
will continue to rethink what we teach
and how,”

Foreach ofthe three years, two se-
lected Grinnell students have attended
MOST summer programs at gradu-
ate schools during the Summers of
their sophomore years. Ofthe S|X stu—
dents, ﬁve are giving serious Consid»
eration to attending graduate school
in sociology.

These summer programs were six
week graduate course designed to pro
vide students with a chance to see
What graduate school would be like.
Each student was assigned a mentor
faculty member from Grinnell and a
faculty member from the school zit
which she or he studied.

Three summers ago, Dawn Davis
‘96 studied at Michigan State Univerr
sity and Lisa White ‘96 studied at the
Texas A&M; two summers ago Yayoi
Suzuki ‘97 studied at Pennsylvania
State University and Mimi Bui ‘97
studied at the University of Massar
chusetts at Amherst; and this past

surnmerAdricnne Enrique: ‘98 stud.
ied at the University of Nebraska.

while Rachel Munoz ‘98 studied at '

the University of California at Santa
Barbara.

Munoz said of her MOST expelie
ence. “it did its job. It gave me an idea
of what graduate school would be like
and the challenges it would present.
and it gave me the conﬁdence that I
would be able to meet those chal-
lengcs."

Each MOST student is assigned a
melitor at Grinnell and deSigns an in-
dependent research project wrth his!
her faculty mentors. Each student also
participates in an independent study tu-
torial with her/his mentor. During their
senior year, each student can serve as
an undergraduate research or a teach-
ing assistant. This reﬂects another of
MOST’S aims: to create minority lead-
ers in sociology within undergraduate
schools to encourage and support other
minority students with an interest in
sociology.

Assistant Professor Susan
Ferguson, who is running the MOST
program at Grinnell during Mr.
Hunter‘s sabbatical. said “i think the
Sociology Department has always
been committed to multicultural issues.
at least in my memory, and we thought
this program was another way to
strengthen our department We have
several students of color interested in
sociology and we want them to feel
welcome in the department and posi—
tively challenged in our classrooms.“

“Everyone should have a positive
experience with art," said Laura
Mace ‘98 on the opening day of the
Forum Terrace Art Gallery's Show of
her work, A Yeal‘ill Provence. This
beliefaiid the paintings and drawings
on display grew out ofMace‘s recent
year in Alx-en-Provence, France.
Her artistic training in Provence had
a strong impact not only on Mace’s
artwork but also on her views regard—
ing art and education in general

Mace, a senior art major from
Colorado, studied at the Institute for
American Universities in Aixsenr
Provence for the fail] 1995 semester.
She took one course at the Marchutz
School, a painting and drawtng
school, and loved it, When the
Marchutz School offered her a schol-
arship to stay and attend full»time for
another semester. she “knew it was
a risk, but did it anyhow." Fulletime
study involved a great deal of trav-
eling to places such as Venice and
Paris. In those cities, Mace and the
other students attended seminars,
museums and galleries to discuss
different art, theories and philoso-
phies. Mace specifically noted
Cezanne as a painter the group stud
led at great deal, as Cezanne for much
of his life painted in Provence and
one of Mace’s professors worked in
a former studio of Cezannc's.

Mace believes that her experience
in Provence led her artwork in new
directions. “Basically," she said, “I
became the artist I wanted to be
come." She swttched her primary
medium; "‘I left Grinnell as a

possible consequence and now we
know and I guess people know too,
that it can be taken very seriously."

He also said that “we're all pretty
sorry about it. We didn‘t know that
there would be a disruption or that
the city would drain 300,000 gallons
of its water supply, It still seems in-
conceivable to me that we could do
anything to the water. You have to
have special equipment. you have to
have intent, and you have to have
something you can poison the water
with And none ofthose things were
up there."

“The whole event was to com»
memoratc Mike, who will soon be
departing for France." said Root.

The story made the front page of
Grinnell‘s Herald Regirler and was
broadcasted on KGRN. Godine said
that a Cedar Rapids newspaper res
porter interviewed him today as well.

views as natural formost artists. “Art

Her experience in Provence also
inﬂuenced the way Mace perceives
the world as an artist. She gained an
ability to “see color harmony in nae

 

 

 

 

 

 

lure." She recalls studying different
artistic constructions ofnature, such
as Baroque and Classical, and feel-
ing inspired. “I learned a whole new
way to look at nature and people,"
she said. “It impacted my vision."

Mace found the atmosphere in
France surrounding an very differ-
ent than that in the United States.
She believes that art is more a pan
of everyday life in France. “Arts are
a part of buildings. food, a part of
life." In addition, Mace Views the
general culture that surrounds the arts
in Europe as different than what she
has experienced in the U.S. “Europe
is more willing to challenge and
change," she said,

Mace is unsure of future plans for
her art, but expresses the desire to
share with others her experiences
with art. She has worked at the As-
pen Art Museum the past two sum-
mers teaching courses to children
and seniors. These courses were in-
novative collaborations with other
institutions in Aspen. including the
Aspen EnVironmental Studies Cen-
ter and the prestigious Aspen Music
School. Mace is excited about the
work she did with these institutions
and sees herself perhaps continuing
with art and education. “I want to
teach," She said. “I want to rechan-
nel what's going on in public schools
in America and art."

Above all, Mace believes that art
can be meaningful for everyone.
Having such a positive experience in
Provence encouraged her to wish that
everyone could have such an expe—
rience with art. “I would like to give
to other people what’s been given to
me," she said.
