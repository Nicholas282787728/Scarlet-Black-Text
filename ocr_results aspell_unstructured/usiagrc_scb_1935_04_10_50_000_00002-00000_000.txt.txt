WHITHER THE PREP CAPS?

The season of prep caps is with us again—
but where? oh where, are the caps? Consider-
able skepticism was expressed by a majority of

the students on the campus when the announcc-'

ment of the new regulations concerning the tradi-
tional scarlet and black toppers was made last
December. A dual purpose was proposed: to
make the wearing of the caps an honor, and to
likewise make it compulsory—if the “honor" has
not been denied.

At that time we chose to take no notice of
this inconsistency of purpose, preferring to give
the arrangement time to prove itself successful
or otherwise before commenting upon it. It
appeared impossible, however, that the two pur-
appeared impossible, however, that the
two purposes could both be fulfilled.
Either the “honor" must be sufficient to cause
the caps to be worn~or else it would be no
“honor"- At any rate, it seemed impossible that
the “honor" principle and the punitive phase of
the system could exist together.

This rationalizing may be faulty: Nor, sim»
ply because the felt toppers have been slow in
appearing, does it prove that the arrangement
has definitely failed; but their absence is begin-
ning to create a great deal of conjecture as to the
future of this long-established Grinnell tradition.
Moreover, unless the feasibility of the new sys—

TWO ’IEHE GETNNELL SCARLET AND BLAOK
— ———.——_————————————-—-——"‘——'—. .

tem is proved this spring—or unless it is altered
to make it workable—the wearing of the prep
cap may very possibly be relegated to the lim'ho
of forgotten customs.

As the prep cop provisions now stand, it
would require a full-time bookkeeper to keep
track of who is privileged to wear the colored
felt and who is not qualified to do so. Yet, if
the punishments for not wearing the capsiwhen
entitled to do soeare to be enforced, such data
must be easily and constantly available. For
complication and'red tape it suggests a campus
edition of the NRA.

There are a number of very good reasons
why the customs of wearing prep caps should
be retained. Let it suffice to say that it pro»
vides the Honor G club with revenukfor very
worthy purposes~which it might have difficulty
in obtaining otherwise, and that it is one of the
few really distinctive traditionsthat this college
age has retained. It was its innate awkwardness
that doomed the dodo to extinction, and, the same
fate will be meted the prep cap if its wearing is
not administered in a simpler manner.

WHAT DO YOU MEANMA?

How high is up? That’s an easy one to
answer compared to the question, “What calibre
of work is considered worthy of an A grade at
Grinnell college?” At least, so one might say
after seaming a table recently drawn up showing
the per cent of As, Bs, Cs, etc. given by the Grin»
nell faculty members for the first semester of
the present school year.

A study of the survey leaves one a bit be—
fuddled to say the least. For instance, one in-
structor in a certain department issued not a
single A for the semester’s work, while another in-
structor in the same department considered the
work of 13-2 per cent of his students worthy of
an A grade. On the other end of the scale we
find that one instructor flunked 6.56 per cent o‘
his students while a second instructor in the de—
partment invited 19.12 per cent to try again.

Omitting the music and physical training
departments, we find that the variation in the pore
tion of As awarded by various professors ranges
from the previously mentioned .0000, to .3103.
The variation in the number of 85 was even
greater, ranging from .1608 to .5385. The varia-
tion in Cs was from .1724 to .6178, and in D5 from
none to .3156. Twenty instructors passed all of
their students, while the per cent of failures meted
out by a single instructor reached the already
mentioned height of 19.12.

“So what?” say you? We humbly offer our
own list of deductions, which you may add to or
disprove as you see fit. First of all, it is futile
to attempt to deduce anything from grades given
by Grinnell college professors; second (since
every one else ignores the first, we feel privileged
to), the practice of simply passing or flunking
students, which has already been introduced in
a few progressive institutions, has some very
strong points in its favor; third, some of the profs
must be using the wrong system; and finally, any
instructor who dispenses 19.12 Es or 31.56 D5 is
tacitly admitting that he can’t get his subject
across, and should either try to remedy the mate
ter or start giving better grades to cover up his
deficiency.

 

The Book Nook

Hy TED KLEIN

“One good book invites another."
If is easy and natural to substitute the
word book in this nationally known
advertising slogan because it is so
simply true. Those of us who read
a book or two from the rental shelf
during the vacation found that our
appetite for good contemporary liter.
ature had only been stimulated by
this taste. Make a point of keeping
in touch with books added from time
to time to the rental shelf. The par.
ticular book you’ve been wanting will
probably be among them.

THE HARSH VOICE by
West.

The book is made up oi four novel.
ettes, or_ long short stories. These four
tales are more than short stories, both
in length and in substance. Each car.
ries a progression of character that
gives it more the temper of a brief
novel. Miss West is a good psycholo.
gist. She can get inside people's
minds and see how they work; and
though one might perhaps cxpect her
to bc inhuman and cruel in the pro.
cess, actually quite the converse is
true. One might expect her to be in.
human, because her critical temper
has so sharp an edge. But she reveals
a warm regard for the mistakably bal—
ncd human race, and displays remark.
llblc breadth of understanding.

In thrce stories of the four, Miss
West has dealt with Americans, and
it has to be admitted that she under.
sends them: their sense of values,
their ambitions. their pettinesses. Her
Americans are too realistic and a
reading of this book stimulates the
healthy realization that in so many
ways we swaggcring Americans have
fallen short.

A HOUSE DIVIDED by Pearl 5.
Buck. This new novel by Mrs. Buck
is built around China in revolution
and the conflict between the young
and old generations. The dilemma
of the modern, educated young men
and women is its theme._ Yuan, son

cf Wong the Tiger, grandson of Wong
Lung, spends some years in America
as a student. He returns to find his
country greatly changed and tom by
the conﬂict between Eastern and West.
em forces, with the latter in the as.
cendancy. Yuan marries a girl of
his own race and clss, and resolves
to forward the cause of the New China
by teaching students modern methods
of agriculture,

This book concludes the trilogy
which opened with “The Good Earth"
and continued with “Sons.” “A House
Divided" is a better bopk than "Sons“
because it is richer and more illumina.
ung. It lacks the emotional power
of "The Good Earth", probably be.
cause it is a less concentrated narra.
tive, dealing as it does with more
complex and more varied material.
The characterization and setting are
the best features of this novel. In all
her work Mrs. Buck seems to have
caught the flavor of the New China.

To the Editor

The Grinnell Scarlet and Black
To the Editor:

Circumstances have recently arisen
which make a reply to your editorial
in the s & B of nearly a month ago
opposing the nation—wide student
strike against war on April 12 as a
futile gesture, more than a more ex.
pressicn of a difference of opinion.
While 1 think you underestimate the
effect of a walk—out involving 100,000
students in crystalizing a sentiment
against war, 1 agree that it is extreme.
ly unfortunate that a more construc-
tive, positive demonstration against
war cannot be used on a large scale.

We consider it both inexpedient and
unnecessary to urge the Grinnell stu.
dents to stage a walk—out of classes
next Friday. Grinnell has been so
sympathetic with all expressions of
peace sentiment that such a strike
would be quite inappropriate. in.
stead of that, the local L. l. D. and
cooperating organizations are conducL
ing the student chapel next Friday,
and we are planning what we hope
will be a more effective protest against
war. Three students who are inter.

 

ested in and capable of discussing this

 

issue will speak on some of the phases
of the problem,

We feel that the stakes of the next
war are not only the lives of the pl-ea
sent generation of young people, but
the prosperous and orderly develop.
ment of civilization as well. There.
fore, Mr. Editor. we invite you. and
all Grinnellians, to join us in our Com.
mon protest against war.

Sincerely,
Larry Upton.
