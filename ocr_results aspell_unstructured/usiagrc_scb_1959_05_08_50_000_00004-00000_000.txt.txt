CIGARETTES

English: NEARSIGHTED PROFESSOR

Get the genuine article

Thinklish translation: This fellow has so
many degrees, he looks like a thermom-
eber. He’s so myopic, he needs glasses to
view things with alarm. Though quite
the man of letters, the only ones he favors
are L.S./M.F.T. “I take a dim view of
other brands," he says. “Give me the
honest taste of at Lucky Strike!” We see
this chap as a sort: of squintelleclual (but:
remarkably farsighted when it comes
to cigarettes).

English: VIKING OARSM EN

l How To MAKE $25

Take a Worditeleuisiun, for example. With it, you can make commer-
cial TV (sellevision), loud TV (yelleuision), bad TV (smelleuisiolt) and
good TV (swellevisiort). That’s Tllinkljshiand it’s that; easy! We’re
paying $25 for the Thinklish words judged best—your check is itching
to go! Send your words to Lucky Strike, Box 67A, Mt. Vernon, New
York. Enclose your name, address, college or university and class.
