BRYAN is COMING.

The Y. M. c. A, has Secured the Noted
Nebraskan ior Monday, June 5—A
Great Lecture.

uHonesty will never perish.” There
are many men who can say such words
and there are many who do say them,
but where will you iind a man who
can put so much force behind the no
terance as William Jennings Bryan?
There are two reasons why words ut-
tered by this man carry much weight.
First, he never says a thing he does
not believe and which he does not try
his best to live up to. Secondly,there
is probably no other man in America
today who has as great power of say-
ing things so they will sticlr.

Since Bryan is amen who has a mes-
sage and who knows just how to de-
liver it, the Y. M. C. A.lectnre course
committee have accepted the chance
to present him to a Grinnell audience.
Fearing that those who do not know
the man will look at him with preju-
diced eyes they think it best to intro-
duce him to his audience and tell why
he should be heard.

Mr. Bryan has gained his wide no-
toriety principally through his con-
nection with the political campaign
of ‘95 and loo and there are many who
consider him as a politician that knows
nothing but polities. such an idea is
wrong. From his early life he has liv»
ed for a purpose, a purpose to give the
world the best there was in him and

. make it do all the good possible. iiis
liie has been founded on principles
anti to t h e s e principles he h a s
adhered most strenuously. 11 e i s
a. man of deep convictions and he
ﬁrmly believes that others should
know those convictions and share
them with him. He believes in his
own country, in its material strength
and moral leadership among the
world's nations. He is always optim-
istic for he has the hope ofyouLh,good
health and of sound morals. There is
not a stirrer or more wholesome person-
ality in the world than he. He loves
books and nature and they have in-
spired him with a sentiment and reel-
ing which combined with his wonder-
ful giit of expression, make true elo»

,rruence. He does not tear and rave
on petty political questions, for to
him they are a side issue. but he pre-
sentsin a convincing way the loity
thoughts which havc worked them—
selves out from his own pure and con-
sciencious liie. His critics say oi him
that he merely has a trained voice
and no more, but what has made him
valuable to his state and country is
his will, disciplined, guided anrl rer
strained by his conscience.

It is probable that Mr. Bryan will

notbe on the lecture platform for
some time after this year. An open
dimein his schedule was found and
the committee have booked him for
Monday, June 5. Nothing short. of a
cyclone should keep you away from
the lecture of this wonderiul thinker
and talker.
