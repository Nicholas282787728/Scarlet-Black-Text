\VC omit much of uliat was vale
Liable in what “7 aitl in order to
present some of the conclusions
reached by the speaker. Tire
economic aspects of this problem
are not so allriiupmtanl as its cf;
fed on the morals of the nation.
There can be no solution of the
problem along the line of Compe-
tition. The railway is a natural
monopoly. As a ﬁrst step toward
reform, let a law be enacted to
forbid secrecy in railway business;
let a tribunal be created which
shall be strong enough to enforce
this law. The bookkeeping should
be prescribctl by the state. Let
the federal government take the
lead in these reforms and the
states iirll into line \\lll\ suitahle
legislation. Let all [ales asuell
as height he ltlili'ormisltuw no
favoritism to aliyoneiequal favor
should be guarmtectl to all

“Government and
control is the only logical solution
of this problem." Gorernrnent
management is as yet a long nay
off. For the present it would he
better for the people to own the
tracks and lease them to private
corporations. Leavetliemanage-
merit to private enterprise, subiect
to state regulations.

What aresome of the hindrances
in the way of these reforms?

received,

Miss Kellenoarger read an orig-
