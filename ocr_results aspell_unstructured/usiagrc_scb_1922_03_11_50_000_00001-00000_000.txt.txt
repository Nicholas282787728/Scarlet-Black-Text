The Alumni Merit Scholarships are
a peculiar form of scholarship, When
Cecil Rhodes wished to sell .
civilization to the rest of the world,
he established the Rhodes Scholar
ships at Oxford University. These
scholarships are awarded to carefully
chosen leaders. The Graduate Co in-

The Alumni Merit Scholarships are
comparatively now, and as is the case
with any new human undertaking,
there is a margin between our ideal
and our present accomplishment. We
are handicapped by the fact that there
is in the popular mind {1 tendency to
confuse the Alumni Merit Scholarship
with the so called athletic scholar-
ships offered by some institutions
but we have made progress.

The faculty scholarship committee
and the Graduate Council are optimi5~
tic over the future of the Alumni
Merit Scholarships and it is their firm
hope that next year and in the years
to come,. every Alumni Merit Schol-
arship may be awarded to a man who
combines strong qualities in the right
proportion and is justly popular with
his fellow students,

The Alumni Merit Scholarships are
a frank bid for leaders.

Hunting For Navy

A deadlock over the question of na-
val reduction seems to be forthcoming
in the Senate, which will present an
opportunity for the administration to
wield its inﬂuence in behalf of the
navy. Republican leaders in the sen-
ate have decided to stand by the nary
and make every effort to save it from
the cutthroat economy which the
house has decided to apply. Senator
Lodge, Republican leader and Senator
Poindexter, acting chairman of the
naval affairs committee, have decided
to rally every resource of administra
tion strength to prevent the w cab of
the navy. They believe that with the
laid of President Harding they can
lconviuce the country that the drastic
lrcduetions proposed by the house
would be unwise.

PAGE. 11, w. Norris, speaking at
Thursday’s chapel, told the story of a
group of young Gl'innell boys who,
quite a number of yeais ago, formed
a . ntiﬂc association for the study
of natural history. Each one spccial-
ized in the field which most appealed
to him, and the spealicrlthen pointed
out the success attained by these
young scientists later in life. The
speaker concluded his story by draw-
ing this moi-n1: That everybody should
llzlvo something to do that they are
not required to do, something that is
done nill'Cly for the love of doing it,
