This week . . .

This week we’ve devoted the IN FOCUS section of the
newspaper to coverage of the general election as it concerns the
Grinnell community. There are descriptions of the Culver-
Grassley and Leach-Larew races, short profiles of local can—
didates, and interviews with the two candidates from Grinnell
College. The collegeassociated candidates are Janet Carl and
Gregg Edwards, both of whom are running for the Iowa House
of Representatives

We hope that the issue will help those of you who are voting
here in the Nov. 4 election We feel that the articles will provide
information about the politics of the area that will be of interest
to everyone, whether they are registered to vote in Grinnell or
not‘ We all live here for most of the year, and the outcome of
this election on the local level may have an effect greater than
that of the election “at home.”

While this paper does not endorse any specific candidates, we
encourage everyone to vote and take an active interest in the
politics of Grinnell and the state of Iowa.
