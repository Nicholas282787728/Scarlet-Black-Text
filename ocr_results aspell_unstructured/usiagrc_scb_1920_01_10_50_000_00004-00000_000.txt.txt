Angus McDonald gave a general idea
at the object' or the convention and
the inspiration gained by the dele-
gates. He stated that the aim of the
Student Volunteer Movement is “To
awaken and maintain an active in.
terest in foreign missions; to get vol-

the volunteers; and to emphasize the
respons'hility or support on the other
students."

Helen Hurling told at the broad-
m'inded policies or the speakers, say»

vention was the need or the world

for Christian young people and for

the continuance of the spirit of sac—
iiﬁce evidenced in the war

attended. The need emphasized by
the Chinese delegation of over a hun»

reason the tremendous need in the
foreign ﬁeld for doctors as compared
to the keen competition here,

ation as possessing the advantages of
civilization contrary to the other hair
of the World which he characterizes
as “out of luck."

requests from employers in tor-tyuthree
states and four foreign countries for
six thousand ﬁve hundred and thirty-
four teachers. These were [or at sorts

state University. If you want a posi—

nest paying employers you must use
the same service they use when in
need or teachers. Experienced and in-
