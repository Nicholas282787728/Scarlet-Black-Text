How we define self governance

We value sclfrgovcrnancc because it allows
us to exercise agency within a community or
our peers.

Rather than being told what [0 do by
an outside group we negotiate our behavior
amongst ourselves and in so doing become
more responsible individuals

Student Affairs, the administrative depart»
ment that facilitates selfrgovernancc, has un-
dergone a lot ofchanges in the
last fewsemesters.We are glad
to see "selfsgov is love" on Sn?
dent Affairs’ white boards,

However, sometimes it
seems that their definition of

ent than how we define it.

Clearly, the term selfsgow
ernance is nebulous.

But, from our point of view, seltgover-
nance means that students hold one another
and themselves accountable for actions that
atrect our community and work together to
create a harmonious atmosphere. Administrar

tors and RLCs provide guidance, but it’s
our job to negotiate and follow the rules we
lrve by.

As the “ amily Resource
Guide", given to the parents
of ﬁrsrryears, states. there are .
not many rules at Grinncll
because 99 percent of the
students on campus live well
enough without them,

For the deviant 1 percent,
the college handles issues casesbyscascr
hopefully rn a manner that best accommoe
dates those students'needs.

Recent administrative actions and

rhetorrc has raised questions about how

selfsgovernance is be-

ing defined. Their idea of

selfrgovernance seems, at

times, to be one in which

students are expected to

govern peers based on ad-
ministrative rules.

they are being watched
and have no say in what
rules they are subject to, they will withdraw
from the supportive community that has
been forged between students, student staff

Today i went to a
swanky tamil hair cut
join, Vinnitos, and
paid 160 rupees for a
haircut, a shave with
a straight blade, and
they washed my hair.
Haircuts usually cost
30-50 rupes but i still
only paid 4 dollars.
downside: my hair is
gelled and i look now
like a backstreet boy
with a mustache.

tuin our backs on them.

instead of complarnrng behind closed
doors, we should actively seek out the open
ears of Houston Dougharty, Travrs Greene
and our RLCs to start a dialogue about our
viewpoints.

According to themselves, they are here as
an “administrative structure intentionally den
signed to challenge and support students to
govern themselves."

we should also challenge and support
the administiation, through conversation,
to not govern us directly, but rather serve as
a resource for students as we create our own
system of governance. We will make mistakes,
but we will also show, as in years past, that the
self-governance which is best for students is
thatwhich is defined by students.

Living as a sketchy alum: the story of an early grad

Harsha Sekar ’08 shares his story as a student who graduated early and now lives as a sketchy alum

"Did you graduate?" or “What are you doing lieie?”aic two
questions i was bombarded with atter deciding to graduate one

year early.

it seems like I've been asked these questions around 50 times
a day every day since 1 returned this year. The answer, usually, is

a resounding, “i don't knowl
i have no idea."
