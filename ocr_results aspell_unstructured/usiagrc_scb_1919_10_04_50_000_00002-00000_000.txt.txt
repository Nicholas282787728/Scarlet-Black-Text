BEAT ARES.

With the Upper Iowa game callccllcd
all chances of an opening game are
shuttered, and the team must meet
Andes without the experience of a price
tide gmne behind them. This puts
an additional burden upon each one
of us, for we too, will lack the 13-
There
is nothing like a game to arouse pep.

Anies. We should have a pep meet.—

perience oi an opening game.

and everybody too, with a. big \Viudup

have a. big delegation of meters at

’l'IIE GRTNNELL SPIRI

“What is this Gl'innell Spirit of
which we have heard so much?" ash
the h‘rcshmcna We cannot deﬁne it.
not we can say that it is something
which characterizes all Grinnell men
and women. It is that indehnite spir—
it that compels every true Grinnollian
to “make good' and it is that old ﬁght
that has won many a battle on the
gridiron. track, diamond and basket-
ball court.

It is that old spirit that forced men
to leave college to ﬁght tor the Union
hack in 1361. The samc spirit called
men and women into this great world—
wide conilict that has just ceased.

It is the same spirit that put Grin-
noll into the Missnuri Valley Comer-
ence, and the same spirit will put the
Scarlet and Black among the leaders
in this conference.

It is the spirit that defeated the
University of Nebraska and the Uni<
versity of Minnesota in tunthall back
in the nineties. it is the spirit that
beat Iowa 10 to o and wallcpsd Drake
86 to 0 on the gridiron.

What is the Grinnell Spirit? We
cannot say, but we do know what it
can do,

What will it do? That is all up
to you. We play Am'es next Satur-
day.

We really had expected to touch

lightly upon the subject of the Wane
derfnl telephone system in the Men’s
Dormlwrles, but then we thought per-
haps it might be just as wall to drop
the subject for one issue.

Gmmh DEBATING.
Grinnell debating deserves the same
loyal support and encouragement that
we give our athletic teams. The de-
hates are merely clashes or intellect
ual instead of athletic prowess. Many
long, weary hours are spent in the
library preparing hriet speeches and
robuttals, and there is little honor at—
tached to this work either.
Boost the debating teams and help
heal: Cornell, Carleton and the other
schools that We may meet. Grinnel'l
dehating deserves your support and
your ﬁrst opportunity to lend this
support will come on Nov. 5 at the

of the three upper classes have pass

was announced Irorii the chapel plet—
Iorni the ﬁrst day, and it has never
been recognized by the new class and
has been especially ignored by the
new men.

This is a. serious matter and every
freshman should thinlt about it for
it is up to every member or me [resh-

are carried out.
