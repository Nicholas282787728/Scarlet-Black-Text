Editor

The Scarlet and Black
Grinnell, Iowa

Dear Sir:

An editorial under the heading
"Make It Pleasant" appeared in the
Wednesday number of The Scarlet
and Black, No one would deny that
the physical training given at Grin-
nell and anywhere else should be
pleasant. All education should he
pleasant. for that matter; and it is
if the work is worth while, for noth-
ing is more enjoyable than to know
one is learning and progressing. How—
'ever, some people have not learned
to see what things really are or
lshould be enjoyable because of their
‘value. It is for the beneﬁt of those
_people that wc have certain courses
lwhlch arc compulsoiy. Those subjects
‘are the bases for others.

This is the case with physical
itraining. It is given as a basis for
lphysicial activities that are to
‘follow, whether that may be in some
competitive game or in the daily life
of the student after he leaves college.
The object of physical education is
not to learn to play a certain game,
to handle a ball, or even to get en-
joyment. It is given for the effect it
has on the student himself. It is
given so that he may get a harmon-
iously developed body, an educated
body, one which will he a help and

not a hindrance to him.

it would he excellent if the college
could offer instruction in some of
the games mentioned in the editorial.
However, to give credit for work like
tennis. golf, and horseback riding
would bc ridiculous as the amount of
exercise a beginner could get in one
of those sports would he rather scant
and undeniably very one-sided—too
one-sided to be labeled physical edu-
cation, It might be physical exercise,
but there is ii vast difference between
physical exercise and physical educa-
tion. Why doesn't somebody suggest
that the college offer credits for
ping pong, or for the Saturday var—
sity dances, or for walking to and
from the dormitories several times a
day, for that all gives quite an ain—
ount of leg exercise?

As a matter of fact, the physical
requirements are too lenicnt. All SELF
dents who are not out for varsity
competition should be required to
take at least two years of physical
education, regardless of what other
sports they participate in. That the
various sports are not sufficient to
give the students a well rounded
training can be seen from the fact
that most coaches use some sort of
caiisthenics in connection with their
sport in order to attain more efﬁc-
iency.

If, as suggested in the editorial,
one enjoys playing tennis, handball.
or the like, he has, of course, the
opportunity to do so, and he should
not retrain from doing so just. be
cause no credit is given for it.

Games, however, are not so much
for the bcginner as for the “ﬁnished”
athlete, In games the athlete has a
chance to demonstrate his control or
lack of control of the various mus-
cles. The one who has subjected him—
self to thorough training moves with
freedom and ease. The one who has
not had a well rounded training may
be able to play the game but his
game is less skillful because of lack
of control of most of his muscles.
Even if he should be fairly good at
a certain game due to prolonged
practice, neither he, nor the specta-
tors watching him, will enjoy it as
much as they would had his body
been more thoroughly drilled. For it
is not so much the game we enjoy
as it is the display of human beauty
and skill as the body goes through
the various movements.

Ancient Greeks knew that. Games
were invented and participated in in
order to give the athlete and the
spectators a chance to see what
glorious skill and beauty could be

ineligibility, the bugaboo of foot—
ball coaches, is present this year
among the five Missouri valley con-
fercnce schools.

At st. Louis, Coach Al Sharpe of
Washington university is bemoaning
the loss of the great Ted Sausselc.
Drake, under Ossie Solem, lost a
regular guard in Francis Sullivan,
also a veteran halfback in “Speed"
Edwards.

10 ot Oldahomn
coach Lynn Waldorf of the Ohio»
homa Aggies has a group of 10 ath—
letcs laboring on their books in order
to become eligible. Wilmoth Neme-
cek, Clarence Highﬁll, and Paul Mc~
ci-eady, all letterinen. are in this
group. Both Lon Graf at Creighton
and Lester (Fuzz) Watt at crinnell
have their worries on the same score.

To be eligible a Missouri valley
conference athlete must meet three
tests. He must prove himself an
amateur, fulfill the scholarship re-
quirements, and satisfy the residence
clause:

Rulo Clear

The much discussed uamateur rule”
in the Valley conference is that a
player who “does not use or is using
his knowledge of athletics or his
athletic skill for gain, or who has
taken part, for a money prize. in any

athletic contest" is an amateur.

A man is automatically barred if
he plays in any game under an as»
sumed heme, receives compensation
for participation in any athletic con-
test or if he receives money from the
university for services rendered by
way of regular instruction. Neither
may he compete in athletics in which
professionals parti pate.

Year’s Residence Required

Athletes must carry a minimum of
12 hours of work during the smiles
ter of competition and must receive
passing grades in at least 80 per cent
of the hours for which they are en-
rolled during the two semesters of
residence immediately preceding
competition. In no case shall the
number of hours credit received dur-
ing these semesters be less than 24.

An athlete in the Missouri Valley
conference must have at least one
year's residence at the university be-
fore he is permitted to participate in
athletics, Summer sessions are not
counted.

When a student changes from one
school to another, having failed in
the ﬁrst institution. he shall not be
tligible for one year, unless such
failures are removed by examination.
A man can only compete for three
years and, once a degree is earned,
he is ineligible.

 

reached by rational training. Games
showed the result and not the means.
Before the athletc was permitted to
compete in public he had to undergo
a severe training period. His train-
ing may be compared to the sculptor
who is making a model. He does not
start out with the ﬁner points but
begins with softening and handling
the clay until it hecomcs pliant, Then
he begins to form the material and
to express what is in him.

“RT.” at crinneli and other edu-
cational institutions should be the
basis for all physical activity. Anyr
body who looks at a half hour of
gym twice a week as a drudgery to
be avoided, should realize that iii
spite of our modern machine age, he
may get into situations after gradua-

will he called upon. And even if he
should spend the rest of his life in a
chair in some ofﬁce, a few years of
real physical training while in col~
lege, may invigorate his whole organ-
ism, which, in turn, may improve
his mental capacity.
Yours truly,
A. N.
