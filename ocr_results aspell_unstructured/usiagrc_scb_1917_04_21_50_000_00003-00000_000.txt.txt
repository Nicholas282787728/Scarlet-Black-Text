Spring football practice goes mer-
rily on in spite of rain, ball or light-
hing. It it rams the thirty-odd men
who are getting out regularly take
their work-outs in the gym. It the sun
shines, they get cut on Ward ﬁeld and
limber up stiff muscles and joints,

The practice will probably not con-
tinue much longer, as Coach Solem
will leave sometime next week. He
has been giving the men regular drill-
in; in signals and formation work, but
no scrimmaging has been done. nor
u-ill any he used. Instead of enjoying
the outing afforded by a. football Cami?
next tall, the squad may be called back
to Grinnell a week earlier, so that
they will be in good shape right from
the start of the season.

Coach Solem is vcry optimistic over
the football situation. "Pinspecis look
might ygoud right now, if the war
doesn’t break things up," he said.
"Some or the new men are showing up
in great shape, and everything looks
fine."

The stunt last year c. icaturing the
u'oineirs Quadrangle made such a hit
that the club this year chose til iien's
Quadrangle as a subject for i wit.
When the curtain was drawn we were
shown two rooms in the dormitories,
in one of which “the rowdics" were
playing poker, the other being the
residence or a mor serious minrlotl
student, who u s trying out for a Phi
Beta Kappa. He was soon joined by a
trio of congenial spirits who pioposed
a game of dominoes. on altercation,
arising between the two groups, was
settled by the matron, who in the per—
son of Roy Stoddard, persuaded the
boys to unite in military drill. It was
a sirlospllttlng production, brimful of
rzire college humor.

The dh-ccior and the club are to he
complimented for the introduction or
a number of new features one of the
best being the placing of The Alumni
Song at the beginning of the third part
and closing the program with the sme-

and it is certain to remain as one or
the happy memories of the year.
