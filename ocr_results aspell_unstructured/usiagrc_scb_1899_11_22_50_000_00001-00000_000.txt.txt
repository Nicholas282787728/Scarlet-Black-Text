Grinnell. 5; Ames, 0.

In Saturday's game. Grinnell
clinched her hold on second place
in the race forthe state champion.
ship. by administering a decisive
defeat to Ames on the latter's
home grounds. Only one score
was made and that was on a touch
down scored by Grinnell, by
straight football in the lattcr part
of the second half, after a most
determined struggle on the part
of both teams.

While the game was well cons
tested on both sides, and Ames
showed a great improvementin
form over two weeks ago, there
can be no doubt that the Grinnell
team won on its merits. Ames
was held for downs frequently and
was often forced to punt, while
Grinnell made good progress both
around the ends and through the
lines, and had it not been for
fumbles. ought to have scored
again.

Besides scoring a touchdown,
Grinnell kept the ball in Ames'
territory most of the time. and
three times approached the goal
closely enough to give Wheeler a
try tor a goal from ﬁeld, although
none of these were successful,
while only once did Ames work
the ball to within kicking dis-
tance. Burd, Lindsay, Douglass,
and Knapp were Grinnell's chief
ground gainers.
