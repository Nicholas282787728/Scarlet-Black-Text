to Dibble which again won the sev-
enth consecutive championship.

So far in the intramural speedball
contests, tho Dibbleites have won
one~hundred per cent of the games
they have played. This means that
they have taken thirty-five games
consecutively in the last seven years.
Although it was widely rumored that
Dibble was due to lose at least one

game this year, none of the other

. teams could produce the necessary

punch or the iron defense against the
pounding forwards.

Selections for the allrdorm team
were made by James Clerk, intra—
mural manager, and Theodore Gley~
steen, sport writer for the SCARLET
AND BLACK.

Lester Scott, Building Four's triple
threat man, is probably the year's
best individual forward. Scott scores
via the field goal, pass, and drop kick
routes, and his clever dribbling alone
would merit him a position on the
team. Patsy~Fararra, with unusual
energy and consistent fight, proved
a constant worry for the opposing
defense. Patsy was often on the re-
ceiving end of the De Long passes.

John Kent, the keyman in Langan's
offense, played his fourth year of in—
tramurel speedhall this fall and his
play indicates his experience. Kent
is the ideal speedhall center, cover-
ing an enormous amount of territory
and always thrreatening a drive
toward the epemy goal. Chuck De-
Long was an important cog in Dib-

ble’s successful passing sttack.‘ Pick3
ing the ball out of 8. heated snrim- #

mags, he would often heave passes of
twenty to twenty»five yards for
scores. Julius Graeher,‘ Clark Hall
captain, plays is consistently aggress-
ive game. His accuracy in passing
and kicking was far ahove average.
Brown Is Fast

Eddie Brown was the most ag~
gressive halfback in the league Fast
on his feet and a sure smrer of en-
emy punts, he returned the bail to
opposing territory consistently. sten
Hipp is probably the coolest player in
the dorms. stain-outguess'es the.“ at—
tacking forwards and Lhen sends the
hall downfield with an exceptionally
powerful kick. John Tatom develop—
ed into a clever halfback almost
as "soon as heistarted to play speed-
hall. Fast footwork and perfect tim—
ing on kicks with either foot made

 

him a sure middle defense
pretty player to watch.
Bernard Tehhens is a stone wall in
defensive play. A good man to size
up a play. he is sure on ground halls
and knows how to break up an aerial
attack. Harold Murray transfers his
basketball skill to the speedball field
to good effect. Murray played dur-

and a

ing the present season, but his play
on passes and his coolness in scrimr
mage mark him as an ideal man for
the last line defense. Ray Warner is
exceptionally agile in spite of lanky
proportions. His quick movements
and effective handling of hard kicked
fly balls made goals very difficult
through the middle.

 

 

THANKFUL, YES!

Just genuinely thankful to be in

Grinnell.

It’s a great community and we

believe in it.

NotI a day passes but we {incl
another reason to be happy and
thankful for the privilege of liv-

ing here and working among so

many friends.

These words express our Thanks-
giving thoughts with genuine
sincerity to everyone in Grinnell

and Community.
