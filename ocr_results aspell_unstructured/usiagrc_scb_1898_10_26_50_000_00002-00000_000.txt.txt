IT is with the greitlest ot satis~
faction that the students have wit—
nessed the actual beginning oi
work on the new men'sgymnasium.
This has been considered an Utor
pian idea torso long, that it seems
hardly possible that it is a reality
at last. It is only by the gener-
osity of the alumni and friends oi
the college that this new gymnae
sium has been made possible, and
to them the greatest of gl‘atlltlde
is due, This has been one of the
most Crying needs or the college
for many years, and will be at the
greatest value in years to come.
SCARLE'l AND BLACK wishes to give
honor to whom lmnot is due, and
to extend the heartiest of thanks
to those whose genero 'ly has
taken so happy a direction.

WITHIN THE last few weeks the
Grinnell Institute and the Chres»
tomathian Society have entered
into an agreement provtding for
the holding of joint debates be-
tween the tivo societies every tour
weeks during the school year.
This seems to be a step in advance
in the progress or literaly work in
Iowa College. For several years
it has been painfully eViLlent that
interest in society work, especially
debating, has been lacking, and
while spasmodic efforts have been
made to quicken tlle lagging err
thusiasrn. no permanent good has
been accomplished. This new ar-
rangcmcnl. however, ought to be
productive of a lccllng oi rivalry
which cannot help but conduce to
a revival of interest in debating
It is to be sincerely hoped that
this may be the case, and that we
may be able to make a more credr
itable showing than formerly in
our contests with other schools.

is llm'zizwr/t’ onthe part or the de-
baters from now until the night of
the debate. The representatives
of the State Normal School, and
State Agricultural College spent
some time in Des Moines this fall
studying in the State Library, in
preparation [or their debate.
While the nlethod of choosing our
debaters has not yet been decided
upon, it would seem advisable
that some method he adopted so
that they may begin stndy on the
question tor the debate, and the
side which we are to support. as
soon as possible. Some oi the
debaters in the two prevtous tie-
bales have been, while studying
on the debate, preparing also for
the home oralorical contest, so
that they have not had time to do
tuil justice to either interest.
Ought there not to be a sufﬁcient
number of men in the college inc
tcicstud in literary work, so that
those who are elected as debaters
may spend all their time and et-
forts in preparation for the home
debate? At the same time there
ought to be at least half a dozen
men at work upon orations tor the
home contest.

We do not believe thht Grin-

are over, and it we can onlyl rain
