Gi-iiiiiell students extend congratulations to the group
or doc Cornell college students who recently staged a
dance despite the repeated war ings of administrative
authority. Eren students in a highly rellgious atmoSr

"Fill the bill" for college functions. Modern dancing to
syncopated tunes is the accepted amusement or the
aonuger set of America. it is to be hoped that the Corr

the case 01' the students who engaged in tlic "wirlieil"
rlaiice.

It. must have seemed curiously inconsistent to Cornell
students ainid tall: oi the right or wrong at dancing that
on one occasion during the year, men and women were
pel‘llllited to ilzlllce together in accordance with all age-01d
tradition, the Colonial Ball. The vulgar steps of the todole

man dressed as Georges, women as alarthas. were allowed
to dance to the nia reel. the Rye waltz and tlic tw ~
step. while the orchestra played such times as ”Couliu'
Through the Rye." “When You and I iverc Young )iiigr
sic." and "Tul‘ke' iii the Straw." Students miist haic
asked, "Are traditions hallowed aiid sanctiﬁed merely
because they are based on the custom oi our grand-
mothers?"

Contrast the situation oi the Cornell Colonial Hall
with that of the same occasion at Gi-iiinell. The one dance
in which both men and iiotiien are not allowed to talre
part at Gl'inllell is the Colonial Ball. So customary has
it become for both Sexes to participate in the dance at
college iiinctions. that the annual Ball has become, indeed,
one or the honored ioiniiiine traditions of the campus,

'rirades against the dance tall on deat ears today.
Criticism either on the basis of social congruity oi- inor-
ality is wasted. Not only has the dance proved a good
‘m . er, but people have ionnd in it sntisiaction oi the love
tor melody and expression or the instinct or rhytlini which
is based on the pulsations or the heart and is therefore a
fundamental part or tile.

it Cornell students must retrain from dancing because

tratcrnal organization on the campus! The name at this
latest acquisition to Washington and Jefferson’s lrnternal
lile is the Blue Key. and like all other bodies, it has a
worthy purpose, namely, to come together twice a month
aild "to study, discuss and strive to turther the best inter
ests of the college, and to promote a spirit or college Ira~
ternalisln among all W. & J. men." It sounds lovely,
doesn't it? Oil, yes! Furthermore, it serves as 6}. connect.-

it there is such a tradition and i:
