Weiss Discusses 'The Phi/asap/ly ‘Of ‘Art',

liy Nancy Pogel
(feature editor)
, Paul Weiss, professor in the
philosophy department at Yale
university, opened the 1959,
.Gatcs lecture series Tuesday
morning in Herrick chapel with
an address, “Work, Craftsman
ship and Art.” In this first lec-
ture, Weiss pointed out the dif-
ference between art and the‘
concepts of work, play and
craftsmanship. .1
“Artr said Weiss, "does have‘
a rationale, a kind of logic of
its own not the product
of reasoning . . . but'something
to be discovered by analysis."
He said that the arts need no
e h reason for “they offer
themselves as self—sufficient."
e Turning to the differences
between art and work, play
and craftsmansh’ , Weiss said,
“It is its creati ty that dis- -
tinguishes art from work, its
intrinsic'excellence that dis»
tinguishes it from play, its
self-sufficiency that distin-'
guishes it from technique and
craftsmanship
“Work iis the controlled ex-
penditure of energy _l:o produce
some result, ', . Where there is
a concentration on means, with
_ no concern for or no opportun—‘,
ity to reach a csult, work, as‘
Dewey has observed, becomes!
labor, toil or drudgery.” Weissl

work because or two things,

gethcr exhibit an excellence
Which is definitary of what is
thereafter to be thought valu-
able by oneself and others.”
In part of his speech from
which Weiss did not read and
in a questioneanswe-r period
which followed the lecture, he
brought out the lact that
While the artist “adventures,
risking ugliness and error, ex- l

not sufficient for a whole life;
it needs to be supplemented by
knowledge and practical Wisdom
and necds the insight, refresh-
ment and freedom which art
provides." Although there are
times when the ethic “has
claims which override art,” the
moralist should not over-exercise
his right by censoring art, for
example, because it makes man

matter being subtended by at
more penetrating concern withl
what is being done.

“The worker works at what
he does, the artist works
while he does something else. i
It is the rtist, not the work: i
or, who immersed in what
is going on. To produce art,
.mind and will, attention and
energy must he united, prefer-
ahly without deliberation or
provision, to constitute a
single, convergent cffortr ,

“The product which is art‘
introduces a radical change in
the meaning and lmport,of the
material that is used. The art

, ist involves thatrmaterlal in his
private‘world and in the world‘
of man. He enables it to havel
new implications and to exhibit
new relations.” Weiss said that:
a work of art is not necessar-l
ily confined to the frame of
society, The worker, on the
other hand, does not givl: his
product the added significance
given art through the new ,im.
plications and new relations be-
cause “the worker does his
work inside the frame of a
society" The work of the art-i
ist has the aesthetic dimension;
added td it; it is his own Crcael
’tion to which he sensitively rte-i
sponds.

Turning tc’art as contrasted
with play, games, and sports,
Weiss said that art is like them
because it does not have to look'
beyond itself to any other end,
“Unlike any of them, art pro.;
duces something valued for it-'
self, work which can usually
be held apart from the produc-
tion of it." He said that with
play, games and sports, ”the
outcome is but the terminus of
the activity. In art the process
and the outcome make a unity,
cacli valuable in itself; both to-

ART AND THE FULL LIFE

Weiss' lecture last _‘Tuesday
night dealt with' ”Art and The
Full Life" in which “art was,
shown to have a value worthy
of withstanding the claims of
ethics, politics and philosophy."‘

He discussed art as it stands
in relation to thesethreeother
“enterprises." He refuted the
argument that these may he s
more worthy, or that art it- i
self is more worthy than the l
other three, by saying that,‘
“none has a primary claim;
each has something to say; ,
each deserves attention; each l
contributes to, hut, does not
by itself, constitute the rich
In]! life." ,‘

Ethics alonc. Weiss said, “isj

can

him~ ,

ihis Craftsmanship to-gel himself“

“indifferent to absolute stand—

ards. particularly those relating;

to right and wrong."

Politics, ,like the purely
ethical life. is “tau austere to
satisfy mans" Politics pro-
vides an area wherein one
may pursue the good life, and
as such, has its place along-

overe

side art,
stepping its bounds, but neith—
er art nor politics need over-
t shadow the other, and neither
l

occasionauy

alone can provide the com..
plete .rich life. ‘

Religion, of the three, accord-
ing to Weiss, seems to be art’s
worst adversary. Because of cer~
tain innate doctrines, religion
cannot but "think itself to have
priority when interests of disci-
pline conflict." Throughout his»
tcry; Weiss sai, much of the
censorship on art has been based
on this primary claim by reli-
l‘gion.

“ll man was created by a
, creator he was evidently cre—
l ated to create, and in doing"
, so, reveals himself as a man
i standing on his own two feet
l with dignity and self respect,

1 now to make the excellent.

excellently." Here too, as with

politics and ethics, religion I

supplements art and art, re-‘

ligion, while neither trespasses ,

upon the other's grounds, but -

Weiss concluded that “ethi'cs,‘
ipolitlcs. religion and art are all
Ispecialized activitis and find
itheir ultimate justification in
,the contribution they- make to' a
llife larger than any‘ one of
‘them alone can provide,"

1 EXPERIENCE, SUBSTANCE
AND REALITY
, Weiss called his third lecture
, Wednesday mor ing “Experience,
‘Substance‘ and Reality,” the
‘meat of his whole series. Weiss
described the four ‘ys one

‘strands—the perceptual, scien-
,tiiic, eventful, and importanti
