Full Strength
Faces Drake

With a. full lineup and an expect-
ant backing, the Crinnell trackmen
today go against their deadly rivals—
Drake university, Having uncere-
moniously trounced the Bulldogs in
the indoor track meet, Pioneer fans
are conﬁdent that their team can re
peat, A six point margin on the
boards isn't much. however, when
the possibilities of upsets in field
events once under the open Sky are
cnnsidegcd.

Drake Rivalry Keen

Bulldog rivalry has been keen this
year. Grinnell dropped the football
contest alter Scaring the very life
out of the Blue and White fans with
a passing attack, and lost both bas-
ketball games. In indoor track, the
Pioneers came back, however, defeat-
ed Drake in a dual meet and capped
the Missouri Valley session. Drake
took the first of the spring baseball
games by a one run margin, but with
a game and a track meet Scheduled
for today, Grinnell has ll. chance to
score a. hard blow to avenge defeats
of earlier in the year.

Decision Up To Discus, Javelin

Grinnell is doped to take the hur-
dles, 440 yard dash, two mile run and
mile relay on the Cinders While the
dashes, mile and half mile will go to
Drake. In the field events, the high
jump will probably be a tin, Grinncll
is favored for the pole vault and the
broad jump, leaving the decisive
points of the meet to the Shot put.

action for the second time of the year
today against Drake university

“1 have had to use up aeroplane
at ditiereut times to get to the scene
of the story, but I am still old fash—
ioncd enough to prefer travelling by
train. The Tribune itself has but one
Plane.” .

For a newspaper the size of and
with the prestige of the Tribune, it
was surprising to learn that only four
separate editions are printed of it
daily. To the Tribune, too, goes the
credit of having the youngest sports
editor in the field of metropolitan
newspapers. Don Maxwell, who edits
Tribune sports, is only twenty-seven
years of age and has charge of the
sports staff with a personnel of such
great scribes as Waller Eckerszlll,
Westbrook Pegler, French Lane, Irv-

lev. Kinsley at present is having a
series of his own stories on unusual

‘English Speaking Union Players’
Give Ancient Operetta Thursday

"Tile English Speaking
Players,” aided and abetted by Gaylord
M. Merriman as the conspiratcr at
the piano, returned to the stage for

their annual appearance Thursday

evening and rounded out the year of
the activities of Jesse Macy Chapter
by Presenting that immortal musical
farce, "Cox and Box.” to a highly
amused audience in Miss MacDonald's
studio on the top floor of the School
of Music building. The audience ills
eluded present and past members of
the chapter. the members of the
School of Music faculty and a low
others.

It is hardly necessary to rehearse
the story of the play, for strange to
say it has a Diet, beyond saying that
Box. a printer, and Cox, a hatter, find
themselves occupying the same room
in Sergeant Bouncer's lodging house,
Box by day and Cox by night. After
they recover from this shock, they
discover a mutual acquaintance in
the person of Penelope Ann, wealthy
proprietress of bathing machines, to
escape marriage with whom Box had
pretended suicide, and with Whom Cox
was even then on the verge of n
matrimonial entanglement. Penelope
Ann is reported drowned, is repnrted
rescued and then sends a letter an»

and Box in the discovery that they
are long lost brothers, the relation-
ship being established by the fact thnt
Mr. Box has not a strawberry mark
on his left arm.

Harold B Hulst na Cox and A. M.
Wilson as Box acted their parts at a
pace that left the audience gasping for
breath. The house was in an up-
roav of laughter most of the time.

clever actors took full advantage,

with marked success and his tasteful
accompaniments were an outstanding
feature of thc evening.

Before the performance Professor
0. E, Payne gave a, talk warning the
audience that any properties which
they failed to see they had only to
imagine. With this understood it was
not hard to realize that two chairs
were a bed, etc.

The performance was so greatly en—
enloyed that there ls talk of repeat-
ing it at a later date for a more ex-
