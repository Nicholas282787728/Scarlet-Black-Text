Tim NEW DEAN.

With the resignation of Dean J. P.
Ryan at the close of the fall term he-
gin's the Dcanship of Professor H. w.
lllatlack

The passing of the S. A. T, C. and
the opening or a different era for
Gl'illllcll afforded Professor Ryan an
opportunity to resign from the duties
of Donn and to devote his entire cf.
forts to teaching,

The new.Dean, Professor Matlack,
has been a part or Crinncll for several
years, and is intimately acquainted
with her traditions and her ideals. He
has been a inll Professor in the School
of Music since 1901. He has the renu-

t tation among the student body of her
ing one of Grinnell’s most popular
chapel speakers.

Mr. Matlack's work as Y, M. C. A.
secretary of the Student Army has af—
forded the opportunity (or a mutual
acnuaintance to spring up between
himself and the men of the institution.
His choice as Dean was a happy one.

COLLEGE ACTIVITIES.-

The beginning of a year always
brings with it the plans and responsi-
bilities of a new.underiaking. The
opening of college this year brings the
plans of a new college era. In our
attempt to change to the normal con—
dition, and bring back the tormer spirit
of the college, there is the danger that
we overdo the tendency.

There are societies and plays and
sports, all to be concentrated in the
period of a lew months. And not
the least, is the college work (or
which we came primarily. The stu-
dent who is starting his work this year
will have the ditiicult choice of out-
side activities, and more than ever be-
lore the urgent necessity of making a
wise choice. In other years, we
could do a little bit of everything
without much danger to our Soscalled
efficiency or to our health. We dab-
bled in dramatics and music and ath-
lctics, if we had the ability. In fact

.many of us did a little bit of every-a
thing and not much of anything.

This s the main thing to avoid, A
jack-ol-all»tl'ades and master of none
does not stay long in one place or posi»
tion, but shifts around, and like the
proverbial rolling stone gathers no
moss. It is much better to conﬁne our
campus activities to fewer things and
do them well, than to try to cover a
great deal of territory in many activi-
ties and not he of much use to any oi
them.

This is true in outside activities as
well as in class room work. The man
or woman who belongs to one of 'the
various literary societies on the cam-
pus and does nothing but attend meets
ings is not of much use to the society.

SUNDAY DA’lIIS.

Because the college men and women
were allowed to have Sunday dates
from tail of last year until Christmas
vacation, the present lack of that priv—
ilege ought, to some, to he explained,
and to the minds of others, justiﬁed.

Since the Sunday date question has
itlw vs caused considerable discussion
in Crinnell, the Student Council
view of this passed a ruling which
permitted every student body to vote
upon the question. That is, every
three years the Sunday date question
automatically comes up, and is voted
upon by the student body.

Believing that the women of the col~
lcgc set the social traditions, the Stu—
dent Council further made the provis-
ion that the question (if the general
vote showed that the sentiment of all
the students was in favor of Sunday
dates) should then be voted upon by
the women, It passed there, it would
go to the student body for considera-
tion, then to the facility.

Last year, Sunday dates were voted
down by the women. The qusetion,
according to the provisions of the
council, was dloplled.

The presence or the S. A. T. C.
brought the ever-recurring subject uu-
dcr discussion agztlil this fall. Since
the men had no other free Limb, a
temporary provision was passed. by the
League Buzlvll, permitting Sunday
datcs for the duration of the s A T. C.
in college. With s demon cation,
this temporary arrangement ceased
The same rules now hold as during
[last year. We have hie-duties on Suns
day.

A COLLEGE DIRECTORY.

There is need for a college directory.
it is next to impossible to get any
of the men in the dormitories by
phone, unless one knows in what par—
ticular building he happens to he
rimming.

The objection to printing a directory
earlier in the year has been removed.
For the next two quarters of the year,
the number of changes in addresses
will he no greater than in past years.
And the fact that one third of the year
is gone, does not lessen the need for a
directory.

Art C will meet at 2:15, Monday and
Wednesday, in Room 3, A. R. H.

THE QUADRANGLE.
For the beneﬁt or the men who are
new this year, and likewise for those

normal conditions of the S. A. T. (1,,
some of the Quadrangle girls have
wondered whether the‘ﬂn‘lntlng of a
iew of the \Vomeu's League regula—
tions might not be of real service.
the men understood the social cus-
toms which had been adopted by vote
or the girls themselves, they would
frequently be able to prevent embar-

also feel assured that they were not
placed in a compromising position
themselves. From the printed booklet
which is in the hands of all the girls

terest to the men:

1L 0. T. C.

Hardly a worse tune could be imag—
ined for the discussion of the estabs
hshmcnt of a Reserve otliccrs Train—
ing Corps at Grinncll. but now that the
subject has been brought up it might
be well to clear up some ialsc im—
pressions regarding it.

Now is not the ume for the catch-
lishment of R. o. T. c. as the college
year has already been, most seriously
interrupted by military affairs. But
next year Gl'lllllell will be running
smoothly on a pl'cdvctr has. and the
introduction of military tr 'ng for a
few hours a neck would have much in
its iavor.

R o. T. c. and s. A. T. c are two
entirely separate and decidedly differ-
ent organ tions.

with a R.‘ O. T. C, three to
hours a wool: would be . ent in mil

would be latch in oouncclum with the
regular collegc wouli. The drill would
be under the direction of an army of—
ucoi, and unilorms and rifles uoulu
be furnished by the gmemlillent. nut
military affairs would have no
greater relative place in college life
than any other study. Uniforms would
be worn for drill only. and the men
would be subject to military discipline
only during those hours. The college
would not run on a military schedule~
there would be no “vanilla“ and

"taps".
