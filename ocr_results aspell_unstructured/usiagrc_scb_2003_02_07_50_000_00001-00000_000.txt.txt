Merit pay
based on
service,
scholarship

Some say lack of attention to
teaching hurtsjunior faculty and
discourages professors from

focusing on classroom time

by Amanda Davis
Staff Writer

Mark Montgomery, professor of Economics, chair of
the faculty and member orthe Faculty Budget Committee.
confessed to doing a lot or reading over winter brealc spe-
cirieally, Montgomery and the other three members or the
Faculty Budgct Committee read extensively about Gtinncll’s
131 other faculty members and theiraccomplishmcnts dur—
ing the previous year, While Montgomery called the pro»
cess “inspiring." it was not exactly leisure reading: the
committee's annual review or faculty was conducted to do
terminc the mctltabzsed pay raise each member will receive.

The Budget Committee is composed of the chairs or
each academic division and the faculty chair Mark
Schneider, physics; Jack Muni, economics; John Mohan,
Russian, and Montgomery in January, the four members
me: [0 determine “muit scores" for each faculty member,
which will eventually be translated into mcrltcbasul raises.
The commune utilized recommendation letters from de-
partment chairs and Faculty Activity Reports from faculty
members.

The muit scores are based on both scholarship and set-
Vicer According to Montgomery, each raculty member re.
ceives a score oroea in each orthese two categories. in the
area orseholarship, a 3 would represent a singleeauthored
book and a i would be given for asingle conference presen—
tation or chapter in a boolc Forservice, chairing a depattr
ment or serving on a high»hurdcn committee would earn a
3 and serving on a committee entailing less responsibility
would earn a 1.

~ However, these two factors are not weighted equally by
the committee when determining how to apportion merit»
based raises. While the relativ: nun-renal importance given
to each category has not yet been determined by the current
Budget Committee, Mongomery said, it is very likely Lila!
scholarship will be given more consideration than service.

Teaching not included

In the past, according to Montgomery, teaching evalua—
tions were incorporated into the Budget Committee's de-
1iberarions. However, since December orzooo. reaching has ‘
not been factored into merit-based raises.

At a meeting on Dec. 4, 2000, die full faculty voted to
standardize the endsofvcourse evaluations, which had previa
ously varied between departments. The faculuy also voted
not to include evaluations in the criteria used to determine
meritebased raises. Since then, the Budget Comnuttcc has
considered neither the prose comments not the numerical
data orthe student evaluations in determining metitrbascd
raises.

The decision not to use evaluations seems to stem from
concerns about their unreliability. Members orrhe faculv/
eited several problems with using evaluations. According to
David Harrison, French, they were considered too inton—
sistent to use when calculating a salary

According to Montgomery, faculrywere also concerned
that evaluations provided only a partial picture or teaching
