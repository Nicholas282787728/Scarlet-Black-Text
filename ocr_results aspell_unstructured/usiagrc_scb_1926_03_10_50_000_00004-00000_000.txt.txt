 

Dread Athletic Heart
Is Myth Says Doctor

College students need no longer
iear that tour years at hard iootball
or track will leave them with a shaky
“athletic heart" in middle age. Ex-
periments by Dr. Burgess Gordon oi
the Peter Brent Brigham hospital on
men and animals revealed that the
heart. instead ol‘ enlarging alter
strenuous exercise. actually shrinks.
Furthermore, no enlargement or the
heart resulted at'tei- prolonged athletic
training.

Dr. Gordon made his observation on
Boston marathon runners, and rabbits
with normal and abnormal hearts.
The.i-ahbits were exercised to exhaus-
tion, and s-ray pictures tairen immed-
iately atteiwards revealed a shrink-
age which took time to disappear.
The strained hearts oi marathon run—
ners also got smaller, Dr. Gordon said,
and did not return to normal ior sev—
eral hours.

Athletes were studied to note any
permanent enlargement oi the heart
which could not be blamed on the ex-
ercise. but it was iourid that the most
prolonged vigorous eiiorts did not
produce the much dreaded hypertrophy
oi the heart.

Tecllow’s own historians write that
tiicre ha» a city on this site as e

Although the railroad and the canal
make the city on important trailing

liaps the most important single instie

‘l'itl‘lnel‘s in the vicinity. More than
eighty percent or the people in the
community are tariuers, but the alkali

Shantung, and the long dry season in
lthe spring eouibine against the grea
lindustry oi the farmers and their iii-
tensiye farming methods, with the re-
shlt that most or the people have
scarcely enough to provide ior their
‘daily needs.

Techow was more ramous in the

way by land and by water troni Fok-
ing to the old southern capital Nank-
ling, passed through the city. From
Ian insci' tion on a p' ion. or arch,
’over this highway, we know that the
Igovernors oi nine provinces were in

on their \Isits to Peking to pay hour

toi-y tor the leaders and everything
points tow rd their winning the charm"

Morris and Kautz were the winning
batteries while Baxter and Loveioy
did the honors toi- Smith, The out-,
come oi the game was never in doubt,
as the heavy hitting Five aggregation
seemed to be holding themselves in

eserve throughout the contest.

Langau succeeded in putting the
hay to the sliding Kelly stable boys,
and deieated them in a close game, 12
to 11. Langau started out and ran up
a. good lead over Three and in the
titth iraiue it stood something like 10
to 2. Then Three showed the only
spurt or the whole game and slugged‘
their score up to 9. l

The sixth inning added anothei"
score for Kelly and the seventh cauie
up with a lo to it: tic. Kelly was
held scoreless and Two pushed over
their tietng and winning runs. Cohen
iztuil Parks were the battery ior Kelly
.and Ginger hurled t'oi- Laugan with
Test behind the bat.

Dibble had an easy time with Four
and ran up a 27 to 3 score in live in—
rings. The boys ii-oni Six were right
and clouted the potato all over the
rafters, Hays was quite eitective iii
the box and held the Foureites to a
minimum or hits. He was in midescde
,son form and will bear watching in
the tuturc games. Mark was called
ltrom tirst base to hurl the last inning
and his work was also commendable.
Locke was behind the bat the entire
‘mllte. The batteries ior Four were
Lindell and Risser.
