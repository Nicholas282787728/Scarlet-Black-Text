LAST WEEK'S BASKET BALL.

Lastweek’s ptlgrimage of the
college basketball team resulted
in things fully as good as the play
ers and devotees of the game had
hoped for. Two strong teams
were met and defeated under con-
ditions which made the close
scores no disappointment. Itis
not too much to say that the 2g»
gregatlon of players and rooters
atlndependence gave our Vteam
an exhrbrtion of unsporlsman
like spirit such as no college
would accord its visitors, At Coe
on the other hand the best of
efforts were put forth to treat us
well. Both games were hard ones
and both gratifying.
