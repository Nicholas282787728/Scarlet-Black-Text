No,t primitive, but still unique

Preacher delivers piety with restraint a

hy Bob Mitchell

”GOSPEL MEETING" shouted
the mimeographed poster in the
.Forum. It was advertising a series
of sermons given by Evangelist
Richard Reed at the Church of
Christ. The time was 7:30 p.m. and
the address was 1127 Elm, close to
Cooper School.

Coming from the skeptical,
religiously liberal background of
suburbia, this advertisement
stimulated my curiosity. But it also
brought to mind images at a bible-
beating preacher screaming at a
wildly ecstatic, frenzied audience.
In particular, H. L. Mencken's
description of a revival in Dayton,
Tennessee, at the time of the
Scopes trial came to mind, He
found: “A young mother . . .
suckling her baby. rocking as the
preacher paced up and down, Two
scared little girls who hugged each
other, their pigtails behind their
backs. An immensely huge
mountain woman, in a gingham
dress out in one piece, (rolling) on
her heels at every ‘Glory of God.’ "

lcan report that it was not quite
as exotic as I had imagined nor as
primitive as Mencken described.
Nonetheless, it was quite unlike
any religious service I had ever
seen. '

As I entered the small, plain
church, my two intrepid friends
and l were greeted by a Mrs.

 

Martin, a pleasant and rotund
woman with glasses and large
white earrings. Like the rest of the
congregation, she obviously took
her gospel seriously. when she
wasn’t concentrating on the ser-

‘mon, she was engaged in quieting

an unruly mob of children sitting
near her, either distributing candy
to placate them or strong-arming
them with the efficiency and
strength of a Chicago cop.
Feeling somewhat out of place
and not wanting to look too con-
spicuous during the sermon while 1
took notes, I sat in the last pew.
From U’llS location I surveyed the

Nowhere was there any of the
standard paraphernalia of
churches, such as Crucifixes,
crosses or stained-glass windows.
This strict entorcement of the
second commandment, along with
the bare ﬂourescent lamps and the
blackboard reminded me very
much of a school room or a
dilapidated, musty office building.

Suddenly, an elderly man stood
up without warning before the
crowd and called “number 84—311
three Verses.” Immediately, with
the man leading, the congregation
stood up and sang

“Nowhere was there any of the standard

paraphernalia of churches, such as crucifixes,

crosses or stained-glass windowsi”

inside of the church. It was very
small, the size of two classrooms.
Overhead hung tour bare
llourescent lamps. suspended from
die ceiling by small chains, The
sanctuary where the pulpit was
located was a tiny cubicle that
could not have been more man ten
to 12 leet wide and ten ieet high.

The Thrill of
Victory . . .

Down at the cross where my savior
died

Down where for cleansing from sin
I cried

There to my heart ﬁle blood ap-
plied;

Glory to his name.

Alter a prayer and another

 

hymn, the sermon began. For a
number of reasons, preacher Reed
contradicted my preconceived
notions about evangelist ministers.
For one thing, he lacked the
hellfire and damnation style of
preaching that seems to be so
popular on late night AM radio,
Almough he trequendy left the
pulpit and paced around in the
front row, occasionally even
venturing halt way up the aisle, his
delivery was restrained and
earnest. In many ways, he came
across like a sincere salesman.
Furthermore, his appear ce was
moderately stylish. Wearing a vest
and a grey suit with a moderately
trimmed aim and moustache,
Reed looked more like a member
of the Jaycees or the Chamber of
Commerce than a firebreathing
preacher of the Word.

Although he looked and talked
like a member of the bourgeoisie,
Reed was an archetypal gospel
preacher in all other aspects. A 33-
year old from Cedar Rapids, Reed
had been preaching tor tour years.
He entered his ministry after
“Studying the bible” and seeing a
great need tor his work. he has
traveled throughout Iowa to bring
the message to the talthtul and
plans to go through the South and
Midwest this summer. He is sup
ported in his work by tunds raised
by five churches in Missouri and

 

Oklahoma. “

He brought to the Church oi
Christ a message that, despite his
relatively restrained and con-
servative demeanor. was strictly
fundamentalist. He beliva in a
literal interpretation of the
Christian Scriptures which he said
Friday night were “written out of
the blood of Jesus," His topic that
evening was baptism, and his main
concern was that it be performed
according to the specifications of
scripture, “When God told us to be
baptized, mat’s the way he wanteg
it done,” he said. ’

Although the sermon was docs
trinaire, there were some sure
prises. The most notable 0i these
was an attack on the Pentagon tong
investing money in.weaponry for
defense. This was toolhardy, Reed
said, because the leaders of the
military should have total faith in
Jesus

Another surprising note was a
passing swipe at the higher, more
ornate Churches, ”1 don’t have
anything against education," Reed
said, “but there are some people
who think the word of God has to be
fancy.”

Reed was clearly echoing the
sentimens of the congregation
with this Statement. Though thertea
was a minimum of the histrionics
had expected trom a revival
meeting, it was still a night of
simple, unadorned religion

agony of defeat
