GRINNELL is rapidly making ad-
vances in the line of needed im-
provements and additionsinbuild-
ings. Within the last year the
Rand gymnasium tor women has
been erected and put into active
service, and noiv the new men's
gymnasium is an assured tact.
and‘ work will be begun as soon
as a suitable plan is selected from
the several which have been pre
'sented, probably in another three
weeks. There is one department,
however, in which the need of lmr
provement is still evident, and
that is the library. Within the
last. few weeks a careful sifting of
the books has been made and
many old and useless copies have
been taken from tlle shelves, but
the fact still remains that the lie
brary is over crowded. SCARLET
AND BLACK would suggest thatthe
next step in the betterment oi
lowa College should be the en

Grlnnell Institute.

Preparation is the one thing
necessary tor a snccesstul literary
program. In this respect the
Grinnell Institute has not as yet
this term been lacking. The pro-
gram Saturday evening was high»
1y instructive as well as Interestr
ing, and clearly showed what qual»
ity or work the society is capable
of doing. The spirit which mani-
[ested itself throughout the even
rug is indeed to be commended.

Eugellce read two recitations,
one being ot a comic nature, the
other descriptive. The contrast
ilt these was very well broughtout
by his pleasing delivery, Current
events were summed up by Hal-
sey, in a way which gave no evi-
dence othasty preparation. Noth-
ing ot importance was omitted.

Miss Haw delighttully enter-
tained those In attendance with a
piano solo. The society, how
ever, was not satisﬁed with one se
leclion. and she kindly responded
to an encore.

Probably the most ﬁnished pro-
duction that the Grinnell Institute
has listened to for some time, was
a paper by Stevens. In it some
of the effects of our recent war
were discussed in a masterly way.
Histlse oi language was excellent.
Whitney very torciblv presented
his ideas in regard to the new Cole
onial policy of the United States.

A great deal at enthusiasm was
aroused by the debate. which was
on the subject or territorial ex-
pansion. Clantlall anti Parish set
torth the advantages ot this pol-
icy, while Swan and Whitney at-
tempted to show why we should
not adopt it. Whitney put upa
very strong extentporaneous de-
bate, he having been appointed to
take the place of Smith, who was
unableto be present. The debate
conducted by
these four men alone. as many
other members took an active part
in it. Consequently the d|SCuSr
sion was very close and spirited.
President Roberts ﬁnally gave his
decision in favor of the negative
