Cor HPRepeats
Drinking Rules,
Shows Procedure

The Council of House Presi—
dents feels that a general dis-
cussion of its policy toward the
drinking rule and the procedures
followed in carrying out these
policies will be of value to the“
students and so is dealing with,
this issue at the present time. i

The drinking rule which the!
c of HP supports and upholds
contains three main provrsions:

1. The state laws as they
pertain to drinking are rec—
ognized at: all times.

2. The use or possession
of liquor on the campus is
not permitted.

3. Any disorderly or dis-
turbing conduct brought
anout by drinking on or off
campus will be punished. .
Any violation of the drinkingl

ruie which is reported to the
u of HP or caued to its atten—i
tion is considered as soon as}
possible after such a report. the“
individuals involved are called:
before the council to ciarityi
their actions or to make any‘
statement about these actions}
inen a decision is macie by the
council and given to the persons
concerned. l

Ail such disciplinary action is
taken in the absence of the
neon of Men.

beating Monmouth, Gi‘innell

broke its awayeflumehome jinx,
winning its first game of the
season on an opponent’s home

court. This Victory also proved
to be the first time the Scarlet

and Black has beaten Monmouth
on their home floor since Conch
John Pfitsch took over the helm
three years ago.

Although Beloit finished the
game with a 35 point margin of

it was all Beloit. The score at
half time was this with Dunlop
failing to score the second qu
ter. By the close of the th -d
period the Bucs had a 46 point
