the rally, organized by Julieanne
Ehre, Kate Goddard, Renee Boss
and Jennifer Spremulli, members of
the group ’s student chapter.

time when abused women share their
experiences and their anger.

“I get very angry when I see the
racism, homophobia and sexism in
this country,” Taylor said. “ltmakes
me very angry to know how vulner-
able my 10-year old daughter is to
violence in this country."

Wording to Jenny litter-McCoy,
a member of Domestic Violence Al-
ternatives in Marshalltown, Women
Take Back the Night rallies began in
the Sixties, sparked by a growing
awareness of the problem of vio»
lence against women. As a solution,
it was suggested that women stay in
at night to avoid being victimized.

Grinnell College is finally getting
into the act of recycling.

Student recyclers say that after
years of unenthusiastic response
from the administration, the college
is just now starting to embrace recy-
cling.

What began a few years ago as a
small student project has mush-
roomed into a recycling effort that
now collects about 1,000 pounds of
paperaweek on campus. And for the
first time. the administration is get-
ting involved.

Thecurrentrecyclingeffortsrarted
about three years ago, when some
members of the strident Audubon
club decided to pitch in on a Knights
of Columbus project collecting
newsprintfor recycling. In the inter-
vening threeyears, theAudubon club

into a staggering task that now in-
volves dozens of volunteers.

The group picks up paper from

But this solution was rejected
because it denied a woman’s rightto
walk the streets at night safely and
ignored the fact that most violence
against women occurs in the home.
Since that time. citizens have been
symbolically gathering one night a
year with candles as a reminder that
violence against women is a serious
problem that needs better solutions.

D.V.A. provided services for 500
women in a four—county area last
year. A 12-member student group
on campus works at the center in
Marshalltown on the crisis line and
provides direct services for the vic»
timized women and children.

Alumnus Wins Nobel

Prize in Chemistry

Grinnell honors-graduate
Thomas R. Cech, a biochemist
at the University of Colorado,
was awarded the Nobel Prize in
chemistry Oct. 12in Stockholm.

Cech shared the award of
$496,000 with Canadian Sid—
ney Altman of Yale University.
The two scientists forced the rcr
writing of biochemistry books
when they showed independ-
ently in the 1970's and early
’SOs that RNA, or ribonucleic
acid. could be a catalyst for a
chemical reaction.

The Swedish Academy said
their discovery “will probably
provideanewtoolforgenetech»
nology, with potential to create
a new defense against viral in»
fections."

Cech’s research involves one
of modern sciences biggest
riddles: how the earliest genes
may have formed and replicated.
Cech and hiscolleagues discov-
eredthatRNAiscapabieof self-
splicing and perhaps reproduc-
ing iself. For years scientists
drought that RN A could not
accomplish splicing without a
protein as a catalyst. Cech’s in-
tricate experiments have uncov-
ered one way that life may have

evolved from the organic mole-
cules that formed the primor-
dial earth.

setts Institute of Technology,

versity of Colorado.
