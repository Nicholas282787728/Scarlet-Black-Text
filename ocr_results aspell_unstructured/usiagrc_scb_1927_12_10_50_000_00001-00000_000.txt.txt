PHUDUBTIUN HEHE

Community Club Not to he Blamed
For Disappointing Acting
Of Heralded Play.

LEADING LADY PLAYS W'ELL

Shaw, Who Played Chico, Shares
Her Acting Honors; Ploy
Lacks Conviction.

by Joseph lfclfco.

“Seventh Heaven" has come and
gone and the Griilllcll Community
club's effort to bring better plays to
the local stage has failed in this in-
stance but the members of the organ
izazion are to be congrzltlllftted~tlieir
reach exceeded their grasp only beause
they put their trust in a producer
who failed to produce.

One really expected great things but
everything was mediocre. The vehicle
was just another war drama of that
ever increasing horde which appeared
shortly after the success of “What
Price Glory." The actors were disaDV
pointing. They wore good clothes, the

- pants were well creased but one
would suggest that the company furn-
ish the wardrobes so the actresses will
not need to dust a. place on the stage
bcfore doing an emotional kneel.

Play Does Have Plot. ’

The surprising thing about the play
was that it had a plot. A man passes
a girl off as his wife to keep her from
going to prison, falls in love with her
and before they are really married he
is called to the front. The young pens
Die are married with the aid of
some religions medals, Four years
pass and the girl becomes an heiress
but she still walls for her husband.
She lhinks him dead but he returns;
blinded but still madly in love—with
her , -

The scenes are laid in that libertine
part of Paris where low of the people
know that the Revolution is over. The
playwright seems to have composed
with that lamlllarity which one gains
from the ardent and unﬂinching perur
sci of “Paris Nights". "Paris Humor."
and other Paris magazines,

Honors in acting, if such must bc
given, go to Billy Janice Meredith,
who played Diane, the girl, and Ed-
ward Shaw who played Chico, the man,
The much heralded Joscph Lavallicrc
was a fat, pndgy indivldual who would
be a more satisfactory auciinnocrlhan
an actor. '

Scenery Falls.

One is tempted to say that what
the cast really needs is an Angus Dr R
Seybolt to show them that blinds are
hands and not sticks, that the scenery
is not to be pulled down during the
nct,»llle fiction really did get so vio~
lent that a running man jerlfcd the
door of the cafe down on poor LaVal—
licre'c head.

one cannot resist the lcmptation to
remark that all but one of the cast
lacked the promised "N00 stk” ac<
cent and he had the most' naive ac-
duirement one hits heard in some
time. The French used was probably
meant to astound some audience of
yoke15#it was foreign liul. Mon Dieu
it was not French.

The posters promised the original
cast but one is quite sure that the
nearest the barnstormers ever came
to being on Broadway was to be on,
not of, the ”Great White Way." Sev-
eral of the characters, especially the
great LaVallicre, reminds one oi the
company which played at chautaudua
last summer in some father and daugh-
ter drama of the Sunday school tyne.

The entire trouble with the-play was
that it lacked conviction. The author,
in the first place was not wholly con-
vinced that he was saying what he
wanted to. the actors were not-in the
slightest convinced that they wanted
to fill the parts and they evidently
weren't aware of the fact that
they were, the hands of the
actors were not convinced that
they were parts of the actor's
being and the scenery was not con-
vinccd that it was intended for the
production. The only conviction of the
evening was that the audience had
been gyped.

 

BASKETBALL TEAM
HAS PRACTICE TILT

l’llml‘t’l“ llllllk Gllull In he nullltll‘
With “Y” Lenders L’Llst Niglll.

Griuiicll college's basketball team
had an hour and a half scrimmage
with the leader's club or the Des
Moilles Y. M, C, A. last night. The
Pioneers looked good and bombarded
the hoop with a baragc oi shots, a
good percentage of which went in.

The guarding of the Pioneers was es
pecially good since they bud to race
a fast and slippery team The Leader's
club, though small, were experienced
basketball players and showed a mark-
ed knowledge of the five points of
the game. All of the visitors were
good dribblei-s and most of them had
an imusual eye for the hoop.

Grinnell’s advantage in size told on

‘ their smaller opponcnls, but lliey kcpt

up a fast aggressive game to the fin-
ish ol' the practice, Griliilcll looks
good enough to give any of the Valley
schools a run for their money this
Year.

January Magazine Offers Liter-

Critic‘s Opinion.

by Grace Adams.

The January Tanager is to be com-
mented nor its contents. If the praise
might not seriously heighten the Talia
agcr's good opinion of itself, it might
be said that this number is above par.
However that may be, (he Tanager
certainly otters a wellrlinlttnced lilcr-
ary feast to the Grinncll student.

.1, w. Charlton's article on lax-ills,
“Some Tariff Twisters," may seem to
be an uninteresting subject; tariffs
foo often have a habit of being dull.
But Mr. Charlton has treated his subs
iect in a very readable manner. The
tariff is discussed as to history and
present circumstance in a direct. clcar,
forceful way. Although the author
seems to he in favor of low tariffs, hc
sees the other side without bitterness
and ranccr: he almost approximates
impartiality.

ll mini Descms Place.

The editorial deserves an equal
place with the leading article. Pro-
fessor Payne writes with his usual dc-
cisive directness. The average stu-
dent may be inclined to pass by such
material as this and the first article,
but. it he possess any inrcsighl what-
soever, it is to his advantage to read
them both.

“Slippery Elm." by Marguerite Gel-A

of description. It is one of those
short stories which grow out of char-
acter sketches, not to be decried, then,
because the character predominates
For a student, it is a promising pic‘cc
of work. Eva Adams “Money, to
Loan” has the same possibilities; eith-
cr one could be called" a character
sketch, and either one could be termed
a short story.

Probably the most popular piece of
writing, that is, the one which will
draw the larger audience. outside of
the character stories, is Professor Col-ls
fli'd's “Our Animal Heritage." The
author's personality so dominates the
article that, were it the driest of dry
theses, it would still attract a number-
of readers.

Poetry is Relief.

The poetry provides relief from the
scriousncss of the prose. The first
two poems would have a serious as
pect but are lyrical in feeling instead.
It is a relief in find that they scan.
The third poem, "Tziganc," is like a
flame in its flickering rhythm; it sucr
ceeds in capturing the gypsy fire or
which it sings. It is strange the way
in which these three poems express
their composers Mr. \Vhlcher's "To
Be Forgotten is maturcly philoso»
phical; \liss Atwater's poem, “The
Dancer," is wistful; Miss Flaige’s is
alive and spirited.

will find an interesting group of re-
actions to recent books, as well

Ethical and Religious Instruction
Is Not Alone Adequate In
Forming Concepts.

By Carolyn Smiﬂi.

“I do lint believe that courses in
ethics and religion are sufficient. they
are necessary, of course, but not suffi-
cient," Pres. D. W. Moreholise of
Drake University told the reporter
Thursday evening following his talk,
at the joint meeting of the Y, M. and
Y. W. C. A., when he was asked where
in his college course a student might
be shown the correct way to approach
religion scientifically.

President Morehouse continued by
adding, "You can get just as much re-
stimnlus for religious
thought in economics, mathematics,
physics, chemistry and astronomy.

Cnullllil Courses Neglected.

"Too little Attention has been paid
the content courses and (on much
stress has been put on the historical
or metaphysical ones, Courses which
are not essentially religious in content
do direct religious thinking which is
fundamental.

”I was once told that in El certain
institution all of the athletes and
funibitll men were telling a course in
Bible. because they could get. through
it, which is certainly not a mural at~
tltude and which was not developing
religious thought, Such is not the case
in all schools, however.

lllfmdcd by the virtuous college author
ities, or if he had had a good voice,
he would have been urged to beconic
a studcnt and take a part in the bitter
and bloody interrsociety debates.

For in 1883, according to college
rules, incn were men, women were lit-
tic known and "never the twain did
meet,” it might almost be said. if a

romantically inclined shiclr yearned
for feminine solacc, he found it neces-
sary to obtain special permission from
the facility board of Discipline. It is
more than likely that had telephones
been in common use, students would
havo insisted on a tacully member for

have facilitated "calling" on a young
lady. All that would have been neces-
sary would have been to call college
central, tell whom the girl was and
wait for central‘s approval or disap—
provai.

FAIL TO CAPTAIN

Elected At Smoker you iiy
Hall For Honor G.

Charles Fail, '29, of Des lioincs,
Honor C man and end on this fall's
football squad, was unanimously elects
ed captain of the team for 1922 at a
smoker givcu Wednesday night by
Clark ball in honor of the varsity
eleven, .

Preceding the election of the captain
for next year, coaches Trllcsdfllc, Watt,
and Duke gave talks on some or the
experiences met during thc past
season. Prof. Earl D. Strong, a mom-
bcr of the athletic board, discussed
fhc rcccut meeting of the Missouri
Vallcy officials at St. Louis, It was
intimatcd by Strong that further
complications, in securing schools to
fill up those places in the conference
left by the re gning schools, had de-
veloped within the last fcw days. No
statement of the situation was made
for the prcss at this time.

All varsity football men, mcmbcrs
of the Honor G club as well as the
members and associates of Clark hall
were present.

Grinnell Basketball Hope Lies In
Wealth of Players With Speed _
And Experience.

(‘lilrli

The question cl whether- small men
with speed and a knowledge of has
kctball can win games in the Miss
sour-i valley will be definitely decided
this cage season. Coach Truesuale
has a squad of short men, who he be-
lieves, can overcome llicir lack of
reach by sheer speed and a sound
knowledge of the gamc.

For the last two weeks, long scrim-
mages, some of them held in the ever
niug to accustom the men to playing
under the bright lights. have been the
rule. The squad has been divided so
that half of the men regularly play in
home game suits and half in out of
town suits. The long sessions have
Proved the fives about equal. One
night the Blacks win by two baskcls
and the next night the Reds have the
advantage.

)[ﬂl’P‘K’lﬂl Is Small.

A wealth of good material, little of
which is large enough to play Valley
basketball a lull game, has forced
Truesdale to adopt a policy of using
men freely, instructing them to play at,
top speed as long 'as they are on the
floor. Thus, he hopes to win his games
this year by s‘cndlng in a constant supr
my of fresh men.

So lal',‘ no dcfinite five has been
picked, and, from all indications no
ﬁve men will be chosen. The compe-
tent sophomore material will probably
be mixed with the veteran so that ten
of twelve men will bear the Pioneer
hopes on the court,

U50 Tllrec Tl'ﬂln‘l

In the practice tilt against 21 Des
Moines "Y" team last night, three
teams were used, all of which showed
a tight defense and a scoring Punch.
No single man stood out because no
single man played long enough to
more than indicate what he might do
later in the season. Veteran alld rooky

both val eti s were found on all three

outcome of the two games. Following
the games of Friday and Saturday,

with Iowa university will be played
