With the first round oi games over
in the intramural baseball round
robin series, four teams stand out as
contenders for the title lieu-son.
Gates, and Clark, Saturda '5 Winners,
will probably all land near the top,

cannot be counted out of the race at
this early date.

Clark appears to have the better

and seems to be the favorite to win
the title, Captains Trumbull and Ben

Another u‘ullrbullumcfl from is the
miuson outfit, but it applii-cntli-
lacks the hitting power ot the Chirlr
team. it probably has one oi the best
)mttcries in the league with “'oolly
“ching and Davis pitching. There isl
ittle to choose between the infield
ind outlield and this factor may
prove decisive in the final analysis.

Dibble was seriously handicapped
Saturday by the loss of Duncan, its
star pitcher, but he will be bnclr for
the rest of the games, and should be
hard to beat, Ullrich caught a great
game Saturday, and Dibble also has
McCl'eéu‘y and Fez-ram to bolster the
infield

Gates may prove to be :i durlr

l Smith has an excellent pitcher in
Phil Risser, who has received little'
support in other seasons, while Lang-
‘an misses Edman, Douglas, James,
and Brooks, mainstays of last year's
team. All in all. the season should
provide plenty of thrills with four
teams closely matched and two others
not far behind.

Poem Puzzles

'erk of 6 Authors Good

in College Verse

By FRANK FURBUSH

Btu-sting fo.th with green wrap
pings and 44 pages, the May issue of
college Verso appeared and subsided.
“Tea Time Tales” by Mr. McQIlztil,
] , and Miss Kochenderfer's sonnets;
Miss Ward's “Crucifixion", Miss Wal»
thr's, Miss Alsterlund’s, and Miss
Mansbai'ger's poems impress une's
memory; the rest have been washed
away This is said, of course, with
recogni on of the fallacy of general-
ization.

“Tea Time Tales" is particularly
striking in its niysti .m, A sense or
remoteness remains, pu .ling, as the
when the music is no hed.
eyes open to find no musician. yes,
holds one finger, horc another, but
the music has left him and gone b.-
yond his control.

Another reason for the poems deep.

impression was its complete objectiv-
ity in a welter of vocal introspection»
ists and nioralists. Just as i sit here
yopping my single impressions, so do
I become disdainful of others‘ imp
pics * mi, No surging emotion comes
in my breast when Mr, Ashkenazy
sings of his soul, when Miss Sqllier

.‘accepts with “a kind finality" her de-

ported loves, or when Miss Coldbaum
soothes her faith which some old
meanie of an English instructor punc.
tured.

George Moore is dead, Shaw soon
will be, and narrative poetry flour-
ishes. Small wonder. Thus, my en»
thusiasin for “Tea Time Tales."
While it is obviously mistaken to at-
tach "narrative" or “objective" to
the poem, it more than escapes per-
sonalism.
