John Kerry

An Open Letter to the Grinnell Community:

This is the ﬁrst letter I have written to the
5653 since graduating from Grinnell in 1965.

I write today because I feel the coming
election is the most important in my lifetime,
and I want to encourage everyone 1 can reach
in swing state lowa to turn our the vot%and
votbfor John Kerry.

For starters, Senator Kerry has a great
record on the environment, while President
Bush has been a disaster (read Republican Paul
O’Neill’s account of the way Bush undercut his
own EPA Secretary). I believe thatjohn Kerry
has acuriosity
and thoughts
fulness that
the present
White House
o c c u p a n t
sorely lacks.

Iraq has
been a major
catastrophe.
In the last four years us. job growth has de-
clined {or the ﬁrst time since Herbert Hoover
occupied the White House.

I could go on and on, but the bottom line
is that George Bush has led a failed adminis»
(ration and should be held accountable.

The election will be close, with voter turns
out crucial. lfyou agree with me that it is time
for a change, please do everything you can to
help Senator Kerry institute that change.

"[T]he bottom line
is that George Bush
has led a failed
administration and
should be held ac-
countable.

Linking Grinnell and Sudan

The UN has called the situation in the
Darfur region of western Sudan the world's
worst humanitarian crisis. It has been estimaF
ed that 50,000 people have died as a result of
the violence and that more than one million
have been displaced, mostly to refugee camps
{caturing desperate humanitarian conditions.
Fighting continues, and ‘Janjaweed’ militias,
the chief perpetrators of the violence, still
roam the countryside largely unchecked by the
government.

Our questions, however, are not just how
unpleasant life in Darfur may be, or whether
the World Food Programme will meet its late
gets or whether there is strictly a “genocide"
underway. When presented with a world event
threatening the very moral fabric ofhumanity,
we Grinnell students have exactly two ques-
tions to ask. “Are any Gtiiliiell alumni in»
volvcd?" and “can thcy get us a job after we
graduate?"

The answers to those questions are,respecs
tively, not really and maybe. '

John Garang ‘6‘) is the leader of
rho sudan People's Liberation Army .
(SPLA) ofsouthern Sudan and one
ofa very few Grinnell alumni who
can honestly claim to have sum-
marily executed people. Neither
he nor his SPLA is directly
involved in the Darfur con- i
ﬂict,howevcr.The SPLA
has mostly kept its dis
tance from Darfur, both
physically and verbally,
since violence erupted last year. Indeed, the
SPLA agreed to a framework for peace with
the government in Khartoum in May of this
year, a month of some of the worst Dartur
rampagcs, and just recently signed an extcnr
sion ofa now nearly twojxear old ceaseﬁre.

It is particularly illustrative of the 81’s
LA’s desire for peace that they have held to
the ceaseﬁre and peace deal throughout the
Darfur crisis. Through rhis summer, a ride of
“diplomatic pressure" from western powers,
including many forccful allusions to the pro?
pect of sanctions, have weakened Khartoum’s
diplomatic position and legitimacy. Were the
SPLA to make a grab for a greater share of
oil revenues or other beneﬁts under the frame-
work agreement, Khartoum would be put in
a very precarious position, racing military or
diplomanc pressure from the sourh and west
of Sudan as well as the UN and Western pOWs
ers.Yet the SPLA has refrained from any pres
vocative action and evinces no inclination to
change that course. A round of peace talks in
Cairo is approaching though, and Mr. Garang

may simply try to play his strengthened hand
in negotiations behind closed doors.

As it stands, the Darfur conﬂict may be
subsiding, if at a glacial pace, as the West’s
prodding has led Khartoum to gradually ap-
ply policics to curtail crimes against humanity
and calm the conﬂict. Khartoum has created
‘civilian protection zones (if not very well res
gardcd by Darfur civilians) and has ordered
token arrests of the odd mass murderer or
otherwise criminal against humanity. Recently,
in what may have been a major breakthrough,
the government and Datfur rebels even agreed
on a draft protocol to protect civilians in the
region.

A modicum ofprogress has been made, but
ifand when the conﬂict will subside is still uns
clear. More than a month ago, the UN issued
an ultimatum demanding that the government
improve the situation within 30 days, though
not specifying any repercussions, A UN report
issued 31 days thereafter said that Khartoum

had done little, and certainly not enough,

_ to improve the security situation in

_ Darfur. The Bush administration has
since responded with a new draft of
the Security Council resolution, fear
turing a new 307day ultimatum, this
time going so far as to explicitly sug

gest the prospect ofsanctions.
‘ Meanwhile the SPLA and
Khartoum have not yer final-
ized the details of a peace
agreement. and much of
it remains to be settled.
As there is no ﬁrm date for a settlement or its
implementation, it seems unlikely that peace
talks will be concluded or a new government
implemented while chaos (or something like
it) reigns in the west of the countryThe SP-
LA's framework terms with Khartoum has Mr.
Garung assuming the vicesprcsidency of the
postwar (at least, postsSouthern war) Sud’as
nese government. It‘s still not clear when or
even ifhe will,butshould he take the post he'll
be well placed to arrange cushy government
positions for desperately unemployed Grinnell
graduarcs.thrhcr he’ll be as well inclined is
another matter.

Columnist's note: On Wednesday, after the
submission of this column, the African Union
sponsored talks between Khartoum and the
two principal Darfur rebel groups were of,
ficially “postponed," suggesting a collapse in
negotiations. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador
(0 the UN. was hoping for a vote on the us.
sponsored resolution on Darfur by today,
