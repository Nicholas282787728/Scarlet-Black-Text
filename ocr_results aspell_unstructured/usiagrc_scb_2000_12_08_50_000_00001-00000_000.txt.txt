The ad hoc committee created to discuss student concerns
with the college's membership in a pair orractory supervision
organizations is nearing consensus.

The committee, which was created by October’s trustee meet-
ing and which consists oftwo students, two faculty, two trust.
ees, and one administrator, will make a non-binding recomr
mendarion to the Executive Council, a group itselrcomposed
orraculry. administrators, and trustees.

For several months ofmeetings, the committee has consid-
ered the costs and benefits ormcmbership in the Workers’ Rights
Consortium and Fair LaborAssociation. Grinnell currently subs
scribes to the FLA, and
the Grinnell college
Students Against
stvratshops has been
lobbying for overayear
for Grinnell‘s
withdrawl from the
FLA and entry into the
WRC. Both organiza—
tions attempt to ensure
that members do not

sor. under pressure from anticsweatshop groups, a number or
colleges across the country have joined the nedgeling wnc over
the past year.

The question was one orscveral major themes discussed in
an October student/trustee forum. and proposed solutions were
met with varying levels ofguardcd enthusiasm by various trust.
ees. At the opening or the school year, President Osgood sug.
gested that 'the college might maintain membership in both
groups.

Committee members either declined to comment or said
they were unclear on exact dates for their decision. “I don't think
we’ll be doing anything with that until we've passed it on to the
trustees," said sociology professor Chris Hunter on when the
information would be circulated to students. “They've got an
Executive Council meeting [in the next few weeks], and they
might pass that on to the board from them." The press release
announcing the committee's creation set a resolution deadline
ot’“beforc the end of December, 2000."

saying he did not feel comfortable discussing the group’s
debates before they were made ofﬁcial, John Knlkbrenner, Dean
of College Services, said, “We've been asked by the board of
trustees to do something; we’re taking our charge very seriously,"
