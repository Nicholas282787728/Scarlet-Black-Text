Former SGA Reporter Rev‘ews First Semester

Dear Editor,

1am on an off-campus prog-
ram this semester and there-
fore will not be reporting on
Student Government activities
for S St E, but Inevertheless
would like to take advantage
ofa semester's experience in
SGA, if I may, to offer some
overall views of Grinnell stu-
dent government.

I don't really know ifanybody
is sure exactly what student
government is supposed to do.
Perhaps it is to give the stud-
ents a feeling of power, of
having some voice in the
determination of policy. Then
again itmighthave some prac-
tical uses, like allowing etude
ents to run the school’s social
program, determining a few
financial matters, and running
a workable judicial system.
Nonetheless, two years ago
there was actually a referenr
durn taken on whether or not
student government should be
abolished, which carries with
it the implicit assumption that
we could get along without
one.

I suppose the main worth of
SGA is simply that we do have
an organization which can be
made use of should the occav
sion arise where it is needed.
Thus student government offi-
cers last year led the way,
rightly or wrongly, for the
closing of the school,and rep
resented student interests in
the recent Great Faculty Re—
quirements debate.

Unfortunately such a struc-
ture often simply finds itself
with no current crisis needing
to be taken (are of. Then it
becomes a burden, a self-
perpetuating bureaucracy with
little real inﬂuence in student
affairs, run by disinterested
and unenthusiastic individr
uals who win the yearly mm-
pus-wide game of chance
known as student government
elections. This, unfortunately,
has been the picture of stud-
ent government all too often.

This ymr the pattern has
followed somewhat true to
form. The Senate is generally
weak and ineffective (with a
few notable exceptions, the
Senators are a dull and un‘
enthusiastic lor), content to
expand the bureaucracy and
sit back to become a "com-
mittee on committees" (a
phrase which somehow
smacks of anattempt to justify
the Senate's existence now
that various and sundry lower
level committees are doing
the work). The Student Gov
ernment leaders, however,
are entirely too enthusiastic
to be true to the old form.
Messrs. Loewi and Vranicar
have accomplished a great
deal in pushing through the
Committee A reforms. getting
student representation on fac-
ulty committees andincreas-
lng student inﬂuence within

We-

the administration. This is
truly a great step forward in
the “student power” move-
ment, but it seems that the
gentlemen unfortunately for
got to inquire whether the
students really wanted such
power. If the reforms were
met with no great rejoicing,
the reason is that few stud-
ents were aware they were
coming, and nobody except
student government had been
working for them.

Student government is, after
all, for the students, and it

seems to me that the basic‘

problem this yearis that studr
ent government has little rela-
tion to the real feelings and
desires of the students. Loewi
and Vranimr are both hard
workers and very capable
(they have even found occa-
sion to run over the Senate
sometimes, which, in View of
this year's Senate, is probably
a good idea). But their inter-
est and drive is not typical of
the Grinnell student body.
Therefore, they do a poor job
of being really representative;

“Felon”

To the Editor,

This letter has been given to
me by my husband, TedGlick,
with the request that I send it
on to you. Ted was a student
at Grinnell in the class of197l.
He left school at the end ofhis
sophomore year.

Ted would like very much to
be able to speak with and to
listen to those at Grinnell
personally. But he isinprison
and ‘ cannot communicate
freely. 'I hope you will’assist
Ted to speak in the only way
open to him by making this
letter public.

In Peace,

Dear Friends,

About three months ago, I
sent a letter out to you from
this same jail. At that time i
had jUSt been arrested as a
result of a ransacking of the
FBI, Selective Service and

U.S. Attorney's offices in the-

Rochester Federal Building.
Since that time lhave gone
through a trial with seven
other defendants and have
been convicted on six felonies,
all dealingwith the destruction
of government property. And
I have been sentenced to eight-
een months in a federal prison,
somewhere in the United
States, for my “crimes."

A were about our trial: seven

student government, and ldo
say this facetiously, is not
appropriately apathetic.

But the alternatives-a care-
little, do-little SGA such as
that under Mr. Lew lastyear"
is even worse. The paradox
can only be resolved if the
students of Grinnell begin to
be more concerned aboutwhat
their student representatives
are doing, and should do, to
improve the place. If they can
do that, then Grinnell might
be deserving ofa studentgov-
ernment which can have real
influence with the way things
are run. But until that time,
an impotent bureaucracy"
despite the best efforts of
Loewi and Vranlcar--is all
we deserve, and all We will
probably get.

That referendum failed two
years ago, and we still have a
student government. Itisabout
time the students forced it to
live up to its potential.

Let’s Raise Caine!

by J. C. Labowitz

This week’s effort starts off
with the most memorable
quote of the vacation. Kurt
Vonnegut (who was to have
been the commencement
speaker this past year, except
for the unfortunate circum—
stance that there was no coma
mencement) hada small cons
tribution to a Playboy article
concerning how fame had
changed the lives of a number
of current authors. The last
paragraph of his introspective
monograph is reproduced
(with no permission what-
ever - tough luck, Hugh) here
with: "What has turned to
ashes in my mouth? Nothing.
The Other day in the mail I
received a Doctor of Letters
degree from Grinnell College,
and with it came this marvel~
ous cowl. I have been wearing
it around all day. lam having
a fine time."

I hope that the fact that Mr.
Vonnegut is having a fine time
with his Grinnell degree will
be a motivating force to all
Grinnell students. (Bythe way,
the treasurer's office has no

record of Vonnegut being paid
for not speaking, so he missed
the tangible pleasure of a
speaking fee). This mention of
Mr. Vonnegut in Playboy set
me to thinking as towhowould
make an appropriate com'
mencement speaker for this
year's graduation. A few sug-
gestions occur to me:

First, there is one man who
was one of the first to speak
out on the War and on the pro-
blems of today's youth, and a
man who remains an idol in
Dirk Gleysteen's eyes - Staff
Sergeant Barry Sadler.

Or (if he is unavailable)per-
haps an outspoken, concerned,
and sympathetic public sers
vant who, besides being vit-
ally concerned with the prob
lems of law enforcement in
Iowa, has taken a great per?
sonal interest in Grinnell
College - Iowa’s own attorney
general, Richard Turner.

Experts from the communi-
cations industry are always
timely and provomtive. In-
spired as we were byMarshall
McLuhan in 1967, someone

of us, including myself, de-
fended ourselves. As a result
we were able to say quite a
bit -- about the worsening of
the war (bombing tonnage is
up 135% since Nixon took of—
fice), about the inhumanity of
prisons, and about the lawV
lessness of agencies of the
government. The basis of our
defense was that what we had
done was not a crime because
we were trying to prevent
much greater crimes. Though
convicted on all counts, the
jury recommended leniency to
the judge in sentencing. And
it has come out that the jury
was hung, two people voting for
complete acquital on all chars
ges, and the verdict reached
was a compromise one. A
newspaper story reported that
almost all of the jurors - very
much ”middle-Americans" -
did nOt want us to go to jail
at all because of their Warm
feeling for us. This was a re
sult of our openingthemselves
to them and discussing our
reasons for acting with them
at the trial. The eight of us
consider these revelations

quite important.

Those revelations say much
to me and I hope to those of
you who read this letter. First
of all, they say that "middle-
America" is not fascist. They
say, as one of the alternate
jurors told us while we were
awaiting a verdict, that most
Americans are very confused
and upset about what's going
on, and they can come to rear
lize the reasons Why young
people would attack govern-
ment property. Those revela-
tions are veryhopeful because
they say that if we, as young
radicals, are willing to talk to
other Ameritzns, they will
listen and will begin moving
towards our position.

What I am trying to say, and
not too well, is this: first of
all, those ofuswho understand
what is going on mustact. And

after acting, in the process of
acting, we must constantly be
explaining ourselves and the
reasons for our action to all
classes and types of Ameris
,cans. We must realize both
that action is urgently needed
to stop the war and to begin to
remake the society; and that
explanation is needed to those
who would at first berepulsed
by what we have done. We must
learn to combihe'n‘oheviolent,
disruptive, serious activity
with a process of education
and movement building. Qir
trial experiences have cons
vinced us that such a course
is very possible and that such
a course offers real hope for
all of us.

Carry it on,

Ted Glick
