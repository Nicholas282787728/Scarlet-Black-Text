Grundler, Renaud

await appeal decision

by Steven W, Way

Three months to the day after computer
operators David Renaud and Mark
Grundler were fired for reasons still unr
disclosed to them, the long and come
plicated appeal process that the two have
gone through is coming to its crescendo.
President George Drake could announce
his decision whether or not to reinstate
them during two sessions he has scheduled
ior next Wednesday.

Shortly after their dismissals in
November, both Renaud and Grundler
decided to appeal directly to Drake, even
though the college has no established
guidelines [or administrative staff to
iollow in challenging what they ieel are une
warranted dismissals.

Due to Drake's heavy schedule oi
January travels, the appeal itseli was put
off until Jan. 14, at which time Renaud met
with Drake. Prolessor of Philosophy Jack
Worley, Renaud's advisor. was also pre
sent

"Hopefully this will be resolved as soon
as pOSSIble.” Renaud said. "Part of what
caused me some griel is that for ad
ministrative staff there is no defined ap-
peal process: consequently, I submitted a

. written letter to the ‘president listing the
grounds-oi my appeal "

In his first letter to the president.
Renaud cited two procedural standards
that he thought were violated. The charges
levied against him were vague and unr
substantiated and he had no chance to
challenge the precepts upon which the
decision was based, Renaud also cited one
substantial breach which he felt the ad-
ministration committed. Based on what he
did know about the reasons for his
'dismissal he'feltzhis actions wouldvnot, have

' merited? ass-harah‘lai pumshmﬁlttESl-ims
,. medatetermin'ationi'. ,' ,
“I didn't know much about the reasons for
my tiring; I‘ve just been trying to extract
teeth to get anything I can get out oi them.
From what I have been able to get. it does

not seem to merit such a harsh reaction,"
Renaud said,

Alter Renaud sent the appeal to Drake
he received a letter from the president
saying that his appeal would be heard on
January 14 The appeal was characterized
by Renaud and Worley as fair. balanced
and complete in all aspects

"Both Mr. Worley and I felt thatwc gota
very iair and complete hearing," Renaud
said. "For the lirst time I felt that Son
meone, in this case the president. had reale
ly listened to my side oi the story. Natural
ly, l‘m anxious to hear how he feels about
the things I said."

During the meeting with Drake, Renaud
relulcd point by point all the charges sure
rounding his liring that he was aware or.
some of which were not told to him the day
he was tired, Since then both he and
Grundler. who declined to comment on the
case. have been waiting for the decision.

"I was not told precisely what the
meeting [with PreSldent Drake next
Wednesday] was to be about but I'm hope
ing it will be some sort of decision.“
Renaud said. “As near as we can deter-
mine the president is iollowing the iaculty
appeal guidelines because there are no
wellrdefined gmdelincs for my classifica
tion oi employment."

in his appeal Renaud is seeking iull
reinstatement to the job from which he
was fired. “I‘m seeking reinstatement
simply because i ieel l was unjustly lired;
I feel I have a right to be reinstated."
Renaud said

The vast outpouring of support lor
Grundler and Renaud among students.
iaculty and many citizens oi Grinnell was
in ‘no way ,caused by personal lobbying.
Renaud said, and the support just keeps
coming. "I‘ve been careiul to steer clear oi
any personal active involvement.
whatever has happened has happened
spontaneously "

SGA coordinators are
busy With new serv1c_es

by Frank Cromwell

SGA has a new look this year, This new
look includes new shuttles. activities and
services

in the past, the SGA's main spheres oi
activities included shuttle transportation
lor students on October, Christmas and
Spring breaks. renting refrigerators. the
Blood Drive, the Book Sale and the Waltz

Since last year. numerous shuttles have
been added. New shuttles now provide
transportation to Kansas city and Ottuma
wa as well as to the LSAT. GRE and
Foreign Service Exams. The transporta-
tion to these exams is coordinated with
Career Services oiiice which assists with
the organizational aspects oi the opera
tion A shuttle also provided transportaion
to Iowa city on Friday nights on two occa-
sions and its popularity is proven by the at.
tendance oi the second trip. which was
tripled.

New activities this year include a
Record Sale and a Square Dance Both 367
tivitles were quite successlul last semester
and plans are to repeal both this semester
Suggestions concerning this semester s
dance include enlarging it and changing
the theme to a Swing Dance or a Sock Hop

There are two new mayor services being
niiered this year. They are Thc'ornpcvinc
and Short-term loans, The (irapeiine.
which is not yet completed, is a survey oi
all the courses oiiered during the year. It
is based on questionnaires which are given
to the members oi the EPC‘s who then
distribute them to the students in their
departments The questionnaires resem-
ble cnd~otrcourse evaluation forms but are
more detailed

The last Grapevine. published in the rail

of 1978. was a terrible effort. according to
Student Coordinator Amy Welch. She is
confident that this one will turn out much
better The survey will be available for the
freshman class Di1932r83 and will include a
survey ol all the classes oilered during the
present academic year.

The shorteterm loans were starlcd last
semester largely in response to the fact
that pay advances were discontinued The
maximum loan is $50 and there is one per
cent interest charged on all loans Accorr
ding to Welch. students have been taking
advantage of the service and so far it has
run smoothly, ,

When asked how the major services
have changed since last year. Welch
replied that they are all more streamlined
and efflclent, one example is the shuttle
tickets now printed by computer which
saves everyone a lot of time.

Welch. who along with her staff was
recovering lrom last Saturday's suc-
cesslul Casmo Night. expressed lrustra-
tion In the amount of red tape that had to
be hacked through In order to organize
new activities and services She was.
however. pleased at the branching out that
has been achieved so far this year and was
coniident that the progress would con-
tlnuc "Part oi tlle problem with knowing
what ideas will work Is due to the extreme
diversity on campus. ' said Welch.

Wclch is assisted by [our workers in the
Student Coordinator's ()lllcc and she laud-
ed ll’lelr efforts. She said that thc olllce has
run with remarkable smoothness. ' n-

MOBE and IPlRG split

The Mobilization for Survival Group
and the Iowa Public Interest Research
Group (IPIRG) have split after a short
union. Jon Levin has taken over leader-
ship of MOBE and Bill Ogilvie will re-
main head of lPlRG.

MOBE and lPlRG joined in spring,
1980 because of the interests that the
group shared. The two groups have
separated again to “sharpen the focus"
of interest, according to Levin. He said
that the split should increase en-
thusiasm especially in MOBE because
the group will have a specific goal on
which to concentrate. MOBE’s aim is to
educate people about the ellects of the
nuclear arms race, nuclear war and
nuclear energy. Along with that inior-
matlon, Levin hopes to educate people
about communicating with and influens
cing congressmen.

Plans [or the independent MOBE in,
clude letter writing campaigns, presene
tations and a movie. Levin wants to
show “The Last Epidemic" wllich is a
series of exerpts from a symposium on
the ellects of nuclear war. Dates have
been set only tentatively for the upcom-
ing events but Levin expects to show
the movie shortly after Spring Break.

Plans for Grinnell
Relays

Preparation has begun for the 10th
annual Grinnell Relays Weekend.
Several committees are already at
work planning this year’s festivities
which are tentatively scheduled for
April 24.

The Relays were first organized in
1973 by Grinnell students and Professor
H. Wayne Meyer. The Grinnell Relays
were developed after deciding that the
more established Drake Relays failed
to provide a suitable display ior Grin-
nell's athletes. The first Relays includ-
ed beer, food, drink, music and fun, as
will the upcoming Relays.

Planned highlights {or this year in-
clude the keg hunt, a search through
campus for a card which will yield a full
keg of beer to the discoverer: a dinner
on central campus featuring Mexican
cuisine: the traditional parade around
campus complete with torch bearer and
a contest ior this year's Relay T-shirt
logo which is already underway. At pre-
sent, there is no word on whether or not
there will be the infamous mudpit
which was not part oi last year’s Relays
Weekend.

GSL program
changes

Recent restrictions in the eligibility

or students applying ior Iowa
Guaranteed Student Loans and addlr
lional regulations in the offing are mak
ing such loans increasingly diiiicult to
obtain {or some students. according to
Ed Jackson. finallcial aid officer at
Marshalltown Community College,
"The maximum family income limit 01
$30,000 placed on students applying lor
these loans alter Oct. 1. 1981. has
eliminated some students from
eligibility," stated Jackson.

The Guaranteed Student Loans are
handled by various lending institutions.
An eligible student may borrow a max—
imum of $2,500 per year. The govern
ment presently pays the nine percent
interest rate for the student for as long
as he is enrolled as at least a one-half-
time student. The student begins repay-
ment of the loan, plus interest. six monr
ths after graduation,

Presently. the lending institutions
collect a five percent “origination iee"
on each loan. which is used to offset the
interest expense incurred by the
government. A major proposed change
would make the program
- need-based,” lowering the eligible
lamily income level subslantially below
the present 530.000 ceiling and restricA
ling these loans only to the neediesl
students, Jackson noted that another
proposed change would increase l'ne
origination iee irom live to 10 percent
so that a student applying tor a max
imum loan or $2.500 would actually only
receive $215“

A third proposal would eliminate all
graduate students from borrowing
under this program li passed by the
Congress. these changes are scheduled
to take clfcct April 1 Due to the pens
