professor Eckharr, a planr

rhe relarionships among rhe
kinds of susrainabiliry: eco.

rhe earrh'e ecosysreme, and 50s
cial susrainabiliry wirh social
yusrice and effecrivc resolurion
of confli‘crs. These rypes of

 

susrainabiliry, he said, can inrerplay in many
ways. For example, is environmenral
susrainabiliry a prerequisire ro social and eco-
nomic susrainabiliry or vice versa?

The College, Eekharr eonrinued, helps rhe
susrainabiliry movemenr rhrough rhe Conard
anironmemal Research Area (CERA). CERA
is used for experimcnis on she resrorarion of
Iowa's narive planr communiries, he said. The
crperimenrs and srudenr work done as CERA
can serve as a model for similar programs and
can creare opporruniries for communiry edu—
carion and ourreach program.

Eckharr also explained rhar rhe College is
conrinuing irs commirmenr io susrairiabiliry
rhrough rhe new cenrer for Prairie srudies
(CPS). Supporred by rhe Fund for Excellence,
CPS is dedicaied ro “increasing ihe awareness,
appreciarion, and undersranding ofall aspecrs
ofrhe Norrh American prairie." Eckharrhopes
rhar CPS will ger Grinnell srudenrs, facolry,
and communiry members involved “ro learn
from and abour rheir locarion . . , nor ro rhink
ofir as irrelevanr, or even as a liabiliry, bur as
an opporruniry." In shorr, he said, rhe CPS
will help srrengrhen Grinnell's sense ofplace

Duke’s Professor Spencer focused on how
roo much ofeducarion, from kindergarren re

rion by whar ir eirher addresses or ignores," he
said. ifeduearion gives people a sense ofplace
and reaches rhem abour rhar place, he conrin.
ued, rhey will be more likely ro respecr ir.

Highlighring ihe rendeney ofeduearion ro

“Srudenrs ar Drake say “iowa is so green,’ Bur
