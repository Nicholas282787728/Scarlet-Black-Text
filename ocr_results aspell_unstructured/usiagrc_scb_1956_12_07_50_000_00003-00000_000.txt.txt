Various Problems

The C of HP this week not-
ed on a. bevy of problems, ill.
cluding the faculty advising

tions problem and Hell night
damages.

The'collnml and Dean R. Ho-
mer Norton suggested for con»
slderatinn .a new laculty advis.
ing program. This' program
would assign one faculty ad~
v‘iser for each hall’s freshmen.
This advi er would meet with
the hall's personnel ,chalrman
before school opens to discuss
Ireshman counselling problemsi

They also suggested a two-
week probationary period at-
ter registration, iollowing
which each ireshman would
be tested to check if his
schedule matches his poten—
lid].

The C of Hl’ also pondered
the problem of improving the
dining hall atmosphere. The
council considered the possibil-
ity of breaking up the long
tables into smaller units, feelr
ing that the size and bareness
of the hall does not contribute
to a mannered atmosphere. The
innovaton of dinner clubs and
the use (if-dinner music also
was suggested.

In connection with the Boar’s
Head dinner, the council asked
the students to leave the new
candles alone. The Council re-
minded students that in taking
the new candles, they are tak
ing from themselves, as the can—
dles are bought for student use
at this year's Boar’s Head dill-
ner and the next.

:On' the Communications
problem discussed in Student:
Council. John Egan, president
of C of HP, asserted, “The
C of HP is in favor of Work—
ing with other student gov-
ernment groups in discussion
or campus-wide problems.
There is always a need,” he
- pointed out, "for better com-
munications among C of HP,
student Council and League
Board."

The C of HP also received a
$25 bill from. Norman W. Marble

oil turned the bills for the dam»

rresentation of Flags

The presentation of flags from
the collar of the Boar's Head
is a main event, There are nine
college ﬂags and’ nine hall flags
on the Boar’s Head, This year
the college flags will be pre—
sented to the presidents ot the
ninc halls while the hall flags
will remain on the Boar's Head.
This svnibolizos the unity or all
the halls in the collage,

Ten members of the crack
drill squad will don the costumes
of haibcrdicrs to load the Boar's
Head procession and to salute
the Boar’s Head.

The Boar's Head dinner was
first held at Queens college,
Oxford, around the year 1250.
The popular story or its origin
tells that a student was at»
tacked by a wild boar while
walking in the woods. He
’shovcd his book of notes on
Aristotle down the bani-’5
throat, choking him to death.
A great ieast was then helri
to celebrate his victory over
the boar.

However, the true historical
significance of Boar’s Head din-
ners rests on the fact that they
have been held in northern
England since antiquity. it is be-
licvcd that the dinner has
evolved from an old Norse cus-
tom of sacriiicing a bear to
Freyer, Scandinavian god of
peace and plenty, every year

Committee for -

: g ' the majority of women were not in
in Frost.” Will mature con- favor of this proposition. '

That Thursday meetings re—
volve around personalities was
the main argument used by
League Board. This is the only
occasion when the members can
bring problems before the board
for discussion. in order to pro-'
tect the women who are'dis—
cussed, the Thursday meetings
have been closed. ‘

The issue of whether an Sari;
reporter should be allowed into
these sessions was put before
the women in order to deter
mine their feelings about it.

However, due to a lack of
communications and under
standing or the problem, the
main issue was misrepresented
to the women, agreed Anna _
Beuckman Wednesday. The
League Board presented the
Problem as stated in the Coun-
cil Corner of the last 5&3.

Recent developments have
proven this issue was not the
main one on trial. Realizing the
urgency of the problem, the
League Board is open to any
suggestions on ways to improve
communications between the
Student Council. the C of HP
and the LB. If the women are
interested, an open meeting or
coffee hour could be held in
the near future.

In housemeetings lVIorlrlay
several suggestions were made,
In general, the women favor-
ed protection by the LB. They
did not Want personal names
and affairs to appear in the
paper.

The women questioned the
type of problems discussed in
the Thursday meetings. it was
suggested that a girl be called
in when her case was being dis-
bussed. It was felt she should
at least have the right to ap—
peal her case. There was a gen—
eral ignorance of the S&E role
in regard to the issue at hand.
