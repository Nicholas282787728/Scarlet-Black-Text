Good grief

- ea, Students and counselors discuss the many ways that people cope with the death

by A ly B e e ry

Gricfcomrs in many forms,

Umair )aved ‘04 srudicd lasr year a: rho bondon School
of Economics. He wasn’t in Grinncll when his bcsr friend
Lenka Stefanov ‘04 committed suicide in May, Javcd said he
welcomed the disrancc he had from the events. “I fccl...rhar
you go rhrough only what you can bear," he said. “Ir was
rraumarizing n if was, far away. I don'r know if I :oiild’ve
been here to acrually susnin that."

Lilly Radoshevich ‘04, another ofStcfaiiov’s friends, was
in France lasr spring. Unlike Javed, she felr like being in Grine
nell during rhc suicides mighr have helped her cope more
effectively. “I rhink rliar had I been here in she middle ofrlic
cmorional rrauma...I would’ve had a more normal period of
grief," sh: said. “I felt like a lor ofrhar
was posrponcd unril no one else was
grieving."

Shelly Mills ‘04 was in Griniicll
lasr spring when her friend Jonnrhun
Raxler ‘04 committed suicide, She
had planned to spend rhe summer
lieu, bur after Raxrer’s death she fclr
char she needed ro go home ro Se-
arrlc. She came back in August “ro
rake rirne ro gcr used ro rhe rown
again." Her furnirurr was scored in
rhe aparrrnenr where Raxrcr was supposed ro live rhis year, “I
couldn't stay rlrcrc because ir crccpcd me our," she said. “The
physical spaoe seemed strange."

Reruming co Grinncll in me fall made rhc springs suir
cldcs seem especially raw re Radoslievicli because she said no
one wanrcd ro ralk wirh her when sh: tried to breach rhc
subject. “I fclr like somcrimes I would bring ir up ro people
and duty would heel-locked. . .Thar silence [was] really trouble—
some to me." Borh javcd arid Radoshcvich said fliey fell a
void when rhcy rerurncd ro campus afrcr being abroad, nor
just in rhc loss ofa friend bur in a lack ofdialogue.

Grief and its forms

The silent: Redoshcvich experienced warnr caused by a
lack of compassion or rhoughrs for rhe issue, bur was more
likely a maniiosrarion ofgri . coording ro Associarc Chap-
lain Deborah Brin, “griefis as individual as individuals are.”
She said humans experience all emorions In differcnr ways
and griefis no cxocprion. And jusr like physical pain, gricfis
sorncrhing rhar happens rhar has ro be dealrwirh.

Kirk Bragg, a fullrrirne rhcrapisr ar Drake Universirywho
has volunrecred ar Grinncll several times srnce lasr spring,
said Lhar gricfvaries nor only in rhc form ir rakes bur also rhc
amount ofrimc ir rakes ro run irs course, whatever rliar course
may be. “Sornc people simply wanr ro avoid—rhcy don’r
wanr ro srir up rhose memories,” Ire said. “Orhers desperarcly
nccd ro srir up rhcir memories so rhar rhey can process rlrcm
and move on."

javcd and Radoshcvlch fair rhcy needed ro face rlrc enro-
rions rhcy experienced when rhey rcrurncd ro Grinncll, bur
may dcalrwirh rheirgrlefin difrcrcnrways. Whilc Rndosl-lcvich
rook rlrc rirne ro walk by Srefanov's room in Younker where
he died in order ro “come ro rermswirlr ir,"]aved said rhar he
“didn't wanr ro gel their close or look at his room.“

Mills :ilso fair uricomforrablc wirh plaocs rhar reminded
her of Raxrei, especially his dorm, Cleveland. “ For awhile ir
was really uncornforrablc ro go III rlrc building," slit: said. “I
can go in now bur I still can'r go ro Cleveland second,"

bragg said rhar rhrsc differences in coping are cnrircly

”I think that it takes some
time for people to heal, obvi-
ously. And people will heal in
different ways."

normal. “I rhink rhnr ir rakes some rimc for people ro heal,
obviously," hesnd, ”And people will hml In diffcrcnr ways,"

Javcd finds ir rhcrapcurlc ro imagine good rimes he had
wirh scefanov, “I would imirare his laugh—I rhoughr he had
me mosr amuing, conragious larrghrcr," said Javed. “When
lrhink ochnko, I rhink ofhis face wirh a smile on u; l don'r
rhinkI could imagine his pain. it’s ,usr too painful for me."

Javed has relied on his fnrrh ro help him cope. “I rry nor
co look for answers for cvcryrhing," he said, “I jusr rhink char
some rhings you just can't rarionalize, because I’ve tried, I'll
rry rn rhc =xrent rhnr I can, and when I don’r come up wirh
anythinng rlrink maybe rhere rsn‘r an answer,"

Mills and Radoshcvich, on rhc orher hand, cach drd a lor
ofrcienrifrc research on suicide, a process rhey found cone

farring. Radoshevich said rhar she
always looks for “concrcre answers,"
even ifshe knew she rrughr nor had
rhern.

Through her research
Radoshcvieh realized rhar “you can’t
rarionalrze why Lenka did ir in par

people do, you can learn rhc charac.

Anniversaries and responses

Javed said char he named ro have a “producrive, good
senioryear” even rhouyr he would be livrng u wirhour one
of his closest friends. Javcd feels Stefanov’s absence in many
ofhis everyday acrivrrrcr because rhey are things rhe rwo did
ragerhen playing soccer, working our, going ra meals and
sirring next ro each orher in class

Alrliough adjusting ro rhis void has been difﬁcult, Iavcd
said Lhar this semnter has been even more difficulr than his
firsr one back ar Grinncll last fall, “I’d had rhc summer and I
had my family and my friends ro ralk ro.“ he said. “ [Now] I
feel like I’m endinga chaprer ofmy life, I rhink abour people
around me who are also in a simrlar posirion And me and
Lcnko had almosr parallel goals. .I feel his absence more now

Some common rencrions to anniversaries rIrar Bragg mcnr
rioned are bad dreams, obsessively replaying rhc evrnrs over
and ovcr again in your mind, slccplcsrncss and all srgns of
depression, such as anxiery and farrgue. ‘hrrnrversarics arc
rriggcrs,” he said. Smells. blooming ﬂowers or rhe degree of
rho sun can all serve as a reminder ofpasr cvcnrs. “There arc

Pam Ferguson's dearh rwo weeks ago sparked sadness in

Mills, Jailed and Radoshcvich, “I'd had l‘K‘I' for a class, and

she was a wonderful lady," said javcd. Fla also realized char
same weekend rhar rhe anniversary ofSrefanovs dearh was
coming up. “The wearhenws really similar ro me [as ro when
Srcfahov died], ir was very gloomy, ir was just roo surreal."

Mills said rhar larely mings have “fair a lor more raw"
because circumsrances such as Fergusons dearlr have been
reminding her of Raxrer. She had Ferguson as a fuse—year
srudenr.

Rndoshcvich hadn’t known Ferguson crcepr as “an excelv
lenr presidenr and a wonderful woman," bur she found her—
selffceling awful abour her deem. she realized rhar she was
associaring rhe dcnrh wirh Stefanov’s. “Wrrh every dearh, you
relive anorl-lcr,"sl1c said,

Thar weekend borh Javcd and Radoshcvich rried re find
ways ro cope wirh rhe combined grief aver Ferguson and
Srcfanov Born ofrhcm associare a spec ar Merrill Park wirh
Srcfanov because ofan Faerer picnic hosred by Europa rnar
rhey all parriciparccl in rheir first year. “I’ve dealr wirli one of
rhc hardcsr runes I've had in awhile. which was when Fan-l
Ferguson died, by walking up more," said Radoshcvicli. “Ir’s
a familiar sire, irs somerhing I associarc wirh Lenka, Ir'r n
place where 1 can rhink and enjoy rhc weather.”

Anncipanng how drfhculr rhis weekend would be, Mills
said, “I have been trying ro plan,..so char I‘m prerry much
busy all rhe lime.” For her, idleness only makes ir worsc.

Coping and adjusting

When Iavcd rerurned ro campus lasr Augusr, he said ir
helped nor (0 feel alone. “Ir was a some: of comforr and
consolarion rhar Lilly was in a similar posirion," he said. He
and Radoshcvich spcnr a lor or’rirrrc ralking wirh each orhcr
and wirh Residenrial Life Coordinaror Don Wcsron, who
helped fill in some of the details for rhcm about ﬁre previous
semosrer which drey had missed by being olir mmprrs,

“Ir was hard. .Coming back and having one group ofse—
niors gone and also having Lenko gone," said Radoshcvich.
"So much changes in rcrms orrhe demographic ofrhc school
rIrar some people you mighr'vc conﬁded in are gone and somc
of rhc everyday people were gone, so wirh rliis new, fresh
class, you felr like you shouldn’t even broach rhc subiccr be»
cause may had norhing ro do wirh ir, rhcy never imagined
rhis,”

Aside from rhe hclp rIrar rlrc chaplains and counselors ar
rlre Mental I—Icalrh Cenrer can offer rhose who are grieving,
connccnons wirh people ofrcn aid in rhc process. whcrher
rlrosc people are on campus or far away. According ro Brin,
rhe role of friends shouldn’t be ro rry ro solve anyrhing or
make rhc gricfgo away, because ifyou rrralrc ir go away rr will
probably iusr come back larcr. She said rhar raking rlre rime
ro pause and “be wirh" enrorions is a good vrmy ro pay aucnr
rion ro grief. ro give irspacc.

Radoshcvich, Javcd and Mills all feel rIrar rhcy have
changed since lasr year. raved and Radoshcvich rhink rhcy

ofrhcir friend. “I’m rhinking e lor more," said laved. “I have
a lor rnorc rhoughrs in my mind rlrar I jusr can’r really express
or ralk re rhe average person rhar I say hi ro abour,"

Javed has rccognizrd rhe inrporrance balancing work, sray.
ing healrhy and socializing. “I've jrrsr rriecl ro remember rhar
rlrrrc are orhcr rhings rIrar are very, very imporrnnr in life," he
said. “You have ro chink abour whar you can do for [chose
you care abourl and whar you mean re main and whnr rhey
