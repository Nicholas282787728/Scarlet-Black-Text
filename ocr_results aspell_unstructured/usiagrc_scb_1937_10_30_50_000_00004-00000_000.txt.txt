sion was bad, and the score re-
mained Drake 20, Grinnell 0.

.At the beginning of the second
half, Grinnell started out strong
with their only serious offensive
threat of the evening, after Rob~
inson drove to Drake’s 15~yard
line, but the threat was cut short.
when a Drake man wrested the
ball from Robinson and ran it
back to Drake's 34. A powerful
offensive drive led by Setrakian,
Secondrstring halfback, ended in
another score, and the point was
good. The score, Drake 27, Grin-
neli o.

Dillon Blocks Kick

Shortly after this score, Wal—
lace’s kick from Grinncll's 27 was
blocked by Dillon, who caught the
ball in the air and returned it for
a touchdown. The conversion, an
attempt at a pass, failed again,
After another series of plays by
both teams, O’Connor took Hay»
ward's kick on his 45-yard line
and returned it for‘a touchdown.
The kick was wide. and the score
stood, Drake 39, Gn'nnell o.

Drake‘s last score came late in
the fourth quarter as Fisher
passed to Woltz for the score, and
the conversion failed. Immediate-
ly after Hayward came through
and set up Gl‘innell’s score. The
final score, Drake 45, Grinnell 7.

Burke Powers

Special mention is due several
Grinnell boys, including Burke
Powers, who played a whale of a
defensive game against almost
hopeless odds. Harry Livermore
threw the whole of his 143 pounds
into every play in a vain effort to
stem the tide, and looked mighty
good doing it. Spence and Witt-
rock and High looked good in the
line, and Schiotterbeck stood out
in the backfield.

For Drake. the Manders boys,
Underwood and Suter looked good,
but the real hero of the game was
Wimpy Setrakian, second string
half, who led the Drake attack
for most of the game.

Grinneil's claim to being the
home of the first inter-collegiate
fotball game west of the Missis~
sippi is made despite the fact
that St. Louis university makes
the claim of having started play—
ing the game in 1386. There,
however, the games were inter»
class affairs or played east of
the river with Illinois colleges.

Without Result

The Blue Book, Grinnell’s an-
nual for 1399, in a history of the
coliege, has this to say of the
1339 football game: '

“In the fall of 1888, Prof. Ja-
seph Torrey, Jr., attempted to in-
troduce the American game of
rugby at Grinnell. None of the
undergraduate body ever had wits
nessed a game and the profes;
Sor‘s experience had been merely
that of a spectator. In conse-
quence the attempt was without
result.

"The following year it happened
that two men. Lou Van Giesen
and Frank Everest, who had con»
tested the previous year on the
preparatory school teams of Bor-
dentown Military .Academy and
.Peddie Institute, came from New
Jersey and entered Iowa college.
A few of the old association
players were soon interested in
the game. After many attempts
enough fellows assembled at the
old academy chapel to make a

appointed to raise funds for the

and Slaughter were the only
members of the faculty who gave
a dollar. The average student
gave the same amount as Prex.”
A return game- at Iowa was
scheduled for Nov. 28, according
to the Blue Book, but was not
played because of the lateness of

years Grinneli again defeated the

Truesdale, in discussing his
plans for the semicentennial con-

hoped to bring back to it as many
of the original players as possible.
