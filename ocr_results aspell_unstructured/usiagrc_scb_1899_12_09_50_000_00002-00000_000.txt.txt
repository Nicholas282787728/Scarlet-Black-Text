SCARLET Ann BLACK wishes to
call the attention of the students
to a matter which should be ate
tended to at once. We refer to
the payment of the subscriptions
to the men’s gymnasium which
have been due for some time.
Subscriptions to the anrount of
Sléoo were obtained by the come
mitlee in charge, all of which was
invested in apparatus. Of this
sum about Siooo has been paid
in, leaving sooo unpaid. The ape
par-atus has been ordered and is
on the way now. All of the sub
scriptions should be paid in by
the time it arrives, so that addi-
tional difﬁcultreswill not be placed
In the way of the building cont-
mittee. Let each student to whom
‘rhis is pertinent realize that he
can assist materially by attending
to this matter and act accord~

ingly.

ALL WHO attended Mr. Marl:-
ham’s lecture last evening are
glad that another opportunity of
hearing him will be given on next
Sunday, when he will address the
students in the chapel at 4 o'clock
in the afternoon. The lecture
last night proves that Mr. Mark-
ham has done more than write
the poem which has made him
tamous. He has given serious
thought to the great problerns
which exist in the world today,
and has embodied the result of
that thought in an address which
is at once interesting and proﬁtar
ble. We would urge that no stur
dent should miss hearing Mr.
Markham next Sunday.

Inconncc-rmn with the inter-
society debate this evening,wlrich

Grinnell in the Colnell-Grinnell
annual debate. it may be of in

been defeated in debate.

Calocaéathia,

The program at Czllocagalhin
Friday afternoon tool: the rather
unusual form of a session of the
House of Representatives. About
twenty members of the society
termed the House, answering at
the roll call by the clerk to the
names of the more well known
representatives. Miss Clark as
Henderson of Iowa was elected
speaker of the [rouse and escorted
to the chair. After the swearing
in of the members and ofﬁcers,
various bills and petitions were
brought up and discussed. A bill
of appropriation for work in the
Philippines was the cause of sev-
eral speeches on expansion by
Helen Millerd as Hill of Illinois,
Helen Starr as Grosvenor othio,
and Martha Fulton as Campbellot
Montana. A bill was then intro
duced by Miss Stoerlein. as Dole
liver of Iowa, [or the changing of
the course of the Mississippi live
er, Miss Noel, Wheeler of Kcnr
tricky, gave a vigorous speech
against this bill and Miss Brunt-
lett. Lane of Iowa, an equally vig.
orous one in favor ofit. These
speeches were very witty and
called forth much applause from
the audience. After several peti-
tions of somewhat local content,
the house adjourned sine die.
The program committee of this
term, of which Miss Olive Wilson
rs chairman, has been especially
successful in arranging interesting
and instructive programs.
