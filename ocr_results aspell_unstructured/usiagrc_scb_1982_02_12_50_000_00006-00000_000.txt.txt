Grinnell’Winter Festival of the Arts

by Patty lsacson

"While you‘re here some people are
basking in die sun in Florida," or so the ad
goes. Unfortunately we can't take that
travel agent‘s advice and hop a plane to a
more civilized part oi the United States.
Frozen noses and numb toes are becoming
routine and the biting cold and dreary
snow were monotonous way back in early
December. Those of us who are sane have
taken refuge next to our favorite radiator
but most oi us are going justa little bit stir
crazy. We need a change of pace here.
some excitement. some entertainment for
our dulled and irozen minds. Well, beginnr
ing next week, entertainment is what we
are going to get, The Student Concert Com
mittee and the Student Film Committee
have joined together to organize the Grin-
nell Winter Festival of the Arts, a Week
long binge of excellent concerts, films and
dance designed to dispel the hypnotic efs
iect oi the cold and get us moving again

First up in this long overdue warming

tion on Feb. 17 and 18. Mary Jane Col-
eman, director ol die Sinking Creek Film
Festival in Greeneville, Tenn., will present
short films made by student and indepen
dent filmmakers in the United States dur
ing the last ten years, The iilms are quite
short. most less than ten minutes, and Ms
Coleman is bringing enough material to
present a dilferent program each night.
This is a rare filmviewing opportunity
since ‘shorts have not been seen in movie
theaters ior many years (See iaura

On Friday night jazz great Pat Matheny
will return to Grinnell to heat up Roberts
Theater. Matheny was very well received
on a previous visit to Grinnell and is retur-
ning to the campus as a special iavor to
Periorming Programs and Activities
Counselor Georgia Dentel Next week he
will be periorming on the West Coast in a
benefit for a sick friend and will stop in
Grinnell on his way home to have some fun
and provide lots or enjoyment ior his
listeners. Because of the Circumstances of
his visit it is unknown if he will be able to
bring any members oi his hand with him.
But the wide range and excellence of his
guitar technique make Pat Matheny an en»
tire jazz ensemble unto himself Although
best known in his native Midwest. Pat

Matheny is steadily building a national
reputation with his distinctive free form
style. Fan Eric Johnson, '32, cites him for
his “ability to evoke images and sensa-
tions through tones and electronic effects
and to create scenes with sounds and
chords." Matheny‘s creatiVity and humor
even ﬂow out into his album titles 7 his
newest release: As Falls Wichita. So Fall
Wichita Falls.

Saturday night, while our ears are still
warm irom the hot jazz 01 Matheny‘s per-
formance, we'll have a chance to hear five
more great jazz performers. the mem hers
of the Heath Brothers Quintet Those of
you who attended last year‘s concert will
surely remember the fine quality which
has placed the Quintet high on unwiibenvs
pool for many, many years. This group has
consistently been ranked in the top ten
listing, very often among the top iive. Two
of its members deserve special notice.
Bassist Percy Heath was. for over 20
years, a member oi the greatly acclaimed
Modern Jazz Quartet (which has now
disbanded). Over his long career he has
developed a sound technique and a
remarkable finesse. Stanley Cowell
(keyboards) is also a well-known perr
iormer and recording artist in his own
right. He has been top ranked among such
greats as McCoy Tyner for many years.
The other musicians in the quintet, Jimmy
Heath on saxophone. Keith Copeland on
percussion and Tony Purrone on guitar.
are very capable oi keeping up with their
distinguished company and the quintet is
one oi the best»known jazz ensembles in
the country The Heath Brothers Quintet is
able to play here at Grinnell under the
auspices of a grant from the National En-
dowment of the Arts (NEA). Since Very lit-
tle money remains in NEA's budget after
Reagan's defense spending the grant is a
measure of the Heath Brothers' success
and stature.

The Sunday event in Herrick displays
some oi our campus talents. At 3 pm. Lee
Cloud will direct a student orchestra in a
concert oi 20-Century music. The coins
posers to be periormed are Samuel Barber
and Igor Stravinsky (who would be
