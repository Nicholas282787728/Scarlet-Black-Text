A note on music

Considering the small activtties tee
and the present policy which rules
against chatgtttg lor tickets to one or

The problem is that tthtle our concerts
budget rcntains the same as it “as one-
hall decade ago. the costs ol concerts
have ttimosl tripled ior many pen

have less money to pay {or a similar
peri'orntance than we had iii the past.
Secondly, because vie pay lor concerts

not legally charge students for tickets
to concerts that come out OI that lee.
This means tltat we can’t presently

Nevertheless. we have come up with

As “th roclt music, the prices have

Disputes Hvush language ‘

To the Editor:

I have been coming to a slow boil in
regards to Michael Hush's articleabout
oft-campus ltvthg. Hush rererred to us
towntes as routs who hold Klan rallies.
Who is this l-tush person?

II' he can print gross generalizations
about a town lull or decent people hovt
can any’ student object to what a
“townie ' might have to say on the sub-
Jecl 0t students?

The sad thing is what you miss with

your provincial pretudices. You are‘
closing yourseli oft to a lot a good-‘
humor and t'riendltness which in it;
years I have found characteristic or
Grinnell. qualities for which the town is '
always nostalgically remembered by -
alumni who have made lull use of theil“
time in this unique place. '

So, Michael, I ask you, as a townie.
student and alum. keep your mind opei'l
nd Hush. ~ Audrey vaitdercoolt .
