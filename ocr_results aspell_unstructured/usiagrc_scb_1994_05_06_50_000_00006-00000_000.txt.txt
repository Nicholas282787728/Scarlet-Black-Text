Beloved on the Chicago and
Midwest live club scene, the
Drovers have also been well-re—
ceived on tours across the coun-
try. They play an eclectic combi-
nation of traditional Irish music
and improvisational guitar rock,
along with other varieties of eth-
nic music.

“[The Drovers] reach back to
the instrumentation and arrange
ments of traditional Irish and
British music. but also swallow
up the simple rock ‘n roll melo-
dies of Lennon and McCartney
circa 1953," reports the CMJ New
Music Report.

They first won attention for
an appearance in Ron Howard‘s

Aidan Quinn. They are featured
on the soundtrack record.

The Drovers' latest record-
ing, “Kill Mice Elf,” is a [our-
song mix displaying mastery over

ranging from aviola to abodhran.
The lyrics, as well as the melo~
dies and rhythms, have been
highly praised by many review»
BIS.

Margaret A. Howard, of
Nightlife, describes one of the
Drovers' “Kill Mice Elf" songs
as “a kind of spacious range that

engages the ear like an ocean
engages the eye.“

The Drovers live shows are
as acclaimed as their recordings:
‘1 i . a stomping. stonking good
time,” reports the Alternative
Press,

Another favorable reviewer
from the Daily Eastern (E. Illi-
nois University) writes of the
Drovers: “They don't just play,
they amaze.“

should be a welcome addition the
Grinnell College weekend, The
Drovers last played at Grinnell

8, 1993.

“Most of our fans have no
idea what Irish traditional music
is." says Dave Callahan, the
group’sbassistandvocalist,“but
we’re not really playing tradir
tional music, We're pulling old
things out of the closet and mak-
ing them into something current,
something that pushes the barri-

ers.

Golem,“ a classic Yiddish play by H.

Leivick, considered by many to be

the greatest poet in Yiddish litera
ture.

The play was presented in St.
Joseph, Minn.. by the combined the-
ater department of the College of St.
Benedict and St. John’s University
under the direction of Kaarin S,
Johnston. In addition to providing
assistance with the production, Pror
lessor Kasimow attended two of the

performances and afterward led dis-
cussions of the play with the audi-
cnce.
“considering the difficulty of under
standing what Leivick intended to
convey in this play, which is partly
based on his own experience as a
prisoner in Siberia, this was an ex-
ceedingly creative production.”

The play is a poetic dramatiza-
tion of an ancient Jewish folk legend
whichexamincs humanrelationships
with God, with other humans and
with our own creations. In a highly
