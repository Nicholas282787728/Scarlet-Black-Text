And two thousand miles away, a mid—

youthful individuals: sweaters and ga-

thrilling harmonies from the musi—

Naturally it seemed toolish to go all

sequently we decided that it short

our shoes and health than a hike to

ﬁre stations, and the like and listened.

What a blessing to mankind is the
aforementioned wireless invention!
Here we were, hearing the music or
Amherst, Columbia and Yale, in the
privacy at our own lire—station! And
then in the midst of the Grinnell
Alumni song would be near interest

“Marinate.” Scores Hit of the
Evening With Traditional
Cmacters Involved.

With three unusual oitein'ngs, press
unfold in just the right sequence, the
Cosmopolitan.club and Prof. w. H.
Trumbauel's production class com-
bined last Saturday nlght to stage the
best hill of oneract plays seen in the
A. R. H. auditorium this year.

"The Cowherd and the Weaving
Maid," a dramatization ol a Chinese
legend, opened as the property man
was slowly putting the moon and the
stars out to pasture for the night. in
fact its slowness might have ,heen
w'earying if we had not been interest—
ed in the Chinese actors, but that is
probably not so lynch a iault of the
play as it is at the Occidental mania
for speed. We liked it because we
were able to recognize, or to think
that we recognized, several touches oi
Oriental philosophy.

Color fulnished the mood for
"Drege", a mle of the underworld. The
hare walls of the A. R. H. stage res-
punded to a lurid lavender and red in
the lights to furnish hoth an effective
and an economical setting. Elmer Van
.Horn took the honors of the evening
for ease and naturalness—we hope to
see him in another play. If “Dregs”
was intended to be depressing, it Was
