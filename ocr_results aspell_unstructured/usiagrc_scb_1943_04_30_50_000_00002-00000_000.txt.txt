Call for Recount--

All items of news appearing on this campus
during the past two weeks seem to have
more than the usual ability to become ”is-

sues." We hope that the action of the Regist—
rar’s advisory committee regarding junior
men taking comprehensive examinations this
year will not have to become such. But it
seems to us that there are obvious flaws in
the action so recently and unexpectedly talc
en.

First, this spring will mean the end of
the college careers of most of the men now
on this campus, The administration and fa—
culty of Grinnell college have maintained
throughout this year what we believe has
been a wise and sympathetic policy toward
underclassmen who are attempting to come
plete as much as possible of their four years
of work. All year these men have been con-
sidered as seniors as far as taking advancr
ed work has been concerned. All year they
have been encouraged to complete their ma-
jor requirement in order to be prepared for
comprehensives, Now, suddenly, they are be-
ing classed as unqualified underclassmen,

_ and being required to take, in addition to a
full schedule of comprehensive examinations,
the course examinations in all but their ma—
jor subject.

_We would like to remind the Registrar‘s
advxsory committee of several facts which
we consider pertinent to this question.
First, these men are going to take compre—

‘ssuc

hcnsives based on four years. of study with—
out the advantage of that period of prepara-
tlon. Most of them have had to crowd the
bare requirements for such examinations
into slightly over a year. Secondly, most of
them are carrying schedules loaded with spe-
cial courses required by their armed service
reserve; courses which in many cases are
completely alien to their major field of con
centration, and which, consequently, will be
difficult to fit into a general review before
examination period. Thirdly, we have no
lending period.

Moreover, the professors 'of these stu—
dents, in computing marks for this semes-
ter's courses, are surely not in need or a final
examination to determine a man's standing.
During this entire year, both semesters, the
professols of Grinnell college have been re,
quired to turn into the registrar a monthly
report of every man in this college for every
course in ullich he is registeled As one
member of this very faculty remarked, upon
hearing of the lmegistral s advisory commit-
tee action, ”Every professol ought to be by
now tholoughly acquainted with the ability
of any man in his class.”

It seems hardly in keeping with the
Grinnell tradition of democracy, so often
praised and so recently exemplified, for a
small committee, moreover a committee not
actively engaged ' teaching, to countermand
the majority opinion of the general faculty
on a problem which is inherently one for fa-
culty, not administration to decide.

If the professors feel satisfied that they
can judge a man's achievement without the
benefit of course examinationithey’ve said
so, if the administration and faculty of Grill-
nell college really want to afford the men
here this year a valuable opportunity to con-
solidate what may be their last academic
training—and so the faculty and administra
tion has said, if in short Grinnell college is
to grant its male students the best of its
training in the long view and for their life—
long utilization — then we think the only
wise course is to allow underclass men who
are completing their academic training to do
so as they would have done in peace-time,
with the emphasis on the field in which they
will work when war is over. The value which
they have received from special war-time
courses they will not lose for not taking final
examinations. That knowledge they have
learned for a specific use. Time will see that
they use it. And when the time for that Lise
is over, we think they will appreciate more
deeply a normal and proper treatment of
their real college training.

Now to return to our own
happy, hucolic campus. Problem
of the week in Margo Willonrs
young life is said to be how she
is going to drag Jim Gardner to
the Blown Derby. Seems Jim.
dear boy. is afraid he's going to
u-in the leather mcdcl on account
of he won an embarrassingly
similar award In high school.
Now we can't imagine why he
should get it . . . . but maybe
Mr. Ryan could tell us.

one thing: will all the o. c. S.’s
