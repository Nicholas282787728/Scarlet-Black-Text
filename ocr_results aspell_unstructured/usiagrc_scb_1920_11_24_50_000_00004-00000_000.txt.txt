Oklahoma Only M. V. Team That

Oklahoma, the Missouri Valley's

toward the undisputed and undeteated
Conference championship. The only

contest with Drake at Des Homes to-

Missouri will in all probability occupy
second and third places on the list.

About 10 colleges and schools or

Ten years ago The Daily Princeton-

What Is Air?

mechanical mixture of moisture, nitrogen and oxygen, with

traces of hydrogen and carbon dioxide,” he would ‘explain.
There was so much oxygen and nitrogen in a given sample that he
simply determined the amount of oxygen present and assumed the
rest to be nitrogen. ’

BEFORE 1894 every chemist thought he knew what air is. “A

One great English chemist, Lord Rayleigh, found that the nitro-
gen obtained from the air was never so pure as that obtained from
some compound like ammonia. What was the “impurity”? In
cooperation with another prominent chemist, Sir William Ramsay,
it was discovered in an entirely new gasi‘hrgori." Later came the
discovery of other rare gases in the atmosphere. The air we breathe
contains about a dozen gases and gaseous compounds.

This study of the air is an example of research in pure science.
Rayleigh and Ramsay had no practical and in view—merely the'dis-
covery of new facts.

A few years ago the Research Laboratories of the General Electric
Company began to study the-destruction of ﬁlaments in exhausted
lamps in order to ascertain how this happened. It was a purely
scientiﬁc undertaking. It was found that the ﬁlament evaporated
——b0iled away, like so much water.

Pressure will check boiling or evaporation. If the pressure within
a boiler is very high, it will take more heat than ordinarily to boil the
water. Would a gas under pressure prevent ﬁlaments iron-i boiling
awa 3 If so, what gas? It must be a gas thabwill not combine
chemically with the ﬁlament, The ﬁlament would burn in oxygen;
hydrogen would conduct the heat away too rapidly. Nitrogen is a
useful gas in this case. It does form a few compounds, however.
Better still is argon. _ It forms no compounds at all.

Thus the modem, efﬁcient, gaseﬁlled lamp appeared, and so argon,
which seemed the most useless gas in the world, found a practical
application.

Discover new facts, and their practical application will take care
of itself.

And the discovery of new facts is the primary purpose of the
Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company.

Sometimes years must elapse before the practical application of a
discovery becomes apparent, as in the case of argon; sometimes a
practical application follows from the mere answering of a “theoret-
ical" question, as in the case of a gas-ﬁlled lamp. But no substantial
progress can be made unless research is conducted for the purpose of
discovering new facts.
