in reference to the role the weather
may have had on the results, Freeman
said, "1r was windy enough ro hurt the

Tennis ’rjeam faces
weekend losses

With less rhan two weeks remain
ing before rhe Midwcst conference
men’s tennis championships, crlnnell
College Coach Andy Hamilton has a
definite idea about what it will rake
for his ream to be successful against
rhe reigning champion Ripon. Aggrcs»
slve play and consistency ofshors need
to be improved he says.

“We still have a chance to win the
league title,” said Hamilton. "But we
need ro remain loose while playing
competitively."

1r parrly was the Pioneers guarded
approach rhar conrrlbured ro thcir o—
1 loss to Ripon last Friday. "We played
defensively and had trouble making
shots," explained rhe coach. "In order
ro be successful againsr Ripon we need

to play aggressively."

The nctmen will have an oppor-
tunity to heed their coach's advice.
Due to a 4-5 loss at Lake Forest- on
Sunday, crlnncll slipped ro a second
place standing in the soudi division.
As the No. 2 sccd, the Pioneers will
face Ripon, die No. 1 northedivision
seed, in the loop championship semi-
ﬁnals.

Solid play last weekend came from
the No. 1 doubles team of Spencer
Piston and Felipe Bautista. The duo
gave Bobby Hagcnow and Tom
Ruffolo olepon their first loss ofrhe
season. They were also triumphant
against Lake Fotcst.

Seth Pourciau and Mike Chang
played "drelr best tennis of the year"

second in the 4x200 relay with a time
of 1:52.45. in the 4x100 Schcrrler,
ldclle Cooper, Lee and Langs clocked
a 53.45 ro ﬁnish fourth.

"Melanie really had a good day
considering she’s had a sore knee for
the last two weeks. i’m proud ofhcr
performance," offered her coach.

in the pole vault Cooper went 8‘
ro place fourth and Tami Baker also
leaped s', a new personal best, ro place

sixth.

"The weather reports didn’t look
favorable for our meet on sarurday but
the day turned out to be OK and we
had some quality performances,"
noted Freeman. "This week most of
our runners will go to Simpson so we
can continue our progrcss in the out-
door season. We havc only two meets
before we run at thc Midwest Confer-
ence championships," said Freeman.

cst 8-6.

Chang continued his outstanding
play intoslngles where he won 5-3, 7-
6. Eautista tamed a Gel. 6—4 win over
Shae Ball of Lake FDIESI. Bell is the
reigning conference No. 2 champion.

"While it was a diﬁicult weekend
because ofrhe losses, Ihav: conﬂdcncc
in the team’s ability to regroup. We
have a young team and lrs future will
be based on the how resilient the play»
ers prove to be in the next two weeks,"
concluded Hamilton.

Sparks declined to pin down

rermlnc what the Universiry can do
ro support susrainable food produc-
tion, whereas another group looks at
how landscaping on campus works
wrrh or againsr rhe environment.
Spencer has found rhar the course also
helps students gain a sense ofplace.

Anne Robinson, a wetlands spec
cialisr, continued wlrh the notion ofa
sense of place. She discussed the rela.
riorishi p between direct experience and
involvement in rhe environmental
movement Robinson called direct ex-
perience with the environment (llc
“cornerstone" of parrlciparion in ms
tainablc living. The more direct expe-
rlence people have, she explained, the
higher the chances for rhclr involve-
ment, “Direct experience helps you be-
comearhomelnaplaceandfeelaneed
to care for it," said Robinson.

But Robinson also Stressed the
need for indirecr experience like lis-
rening to inspiring stories or music,
“stories or songs about people taking
action and making rhelmposslble pose
siblc."

professor Caulkins told the audi-
ence such a srory, the theme ofwhich

was “by and large, we must act." A
resident of crinnell for 30 years, he
described rhe changes of the town's
surrounding farmlands: groves of
hickory and oak cur down, winding
creeks and streams srralghrencd, na—
rlve prairie plowed into rows ofbeans
and corn,

Saddened by the diminished
beauty of Grinnell, caulkins decided
ro rake action. With rhe help ofeighr
orher families (all crlnnell faculry or
former faculty), caulklns bought 650
acres ofland in Pleasanr Grove [own-
slrlp of Mahaska County (30 milcs
south of Grinncll), saving the land
from becoming a boarrng and jet ski
resort. Together, rhe nine families
formed a Corporation called Pleasant
Grove Land Preservation, Inc. “While
we can and should work through in-
stitutions, we need to be prepared to
Cl’CalC our own institutions," said
caulklns.

“Our mission is to enhance the
land we have putchascd." said
caulklns. “We hope to involve stu»
denrs ln rhe resrorarlon of prairie
grasses and foresr habirars.Thls spring

wc arc planting [i]: ﬁrst ofthcsc prai-
rie grasses and prairie flowers."

Caulkins hopes that Pleasant
Grove Land Preservation, Inc. will pro-
mote a “broad-spectrum activism."
”To do this, however, on: needs to be
able to cmparhire with diffcrcnt points
of view, so that mutual lcarning can
take place," he addcd.

Lolya Lipchitz described a
Gtinnellebased project that focuses on
this kind ofmutual learning. It is called
CBIG 7 Community Building in
Grinnell. The program, Lipehlrzsald,
focuses on ways in which mcmbcts of
the Grinncll community can contrlb.
ute to social sustainability These ways
include cffcctivcly resolving conﬂicts
through mediation and tcaching stu-
dents ofall ages about conﬂict resolu-
tion through non-violence. “Wc try to
teach community mcmbcts to have a
positive view of conﬂict. When dcalt
with effectively and non-violently.
conﬂict can enrich a community, not
polarlzc it," Lipchitz said.

The panel discussion fielded a
range ofqucstions. But the promincnt
one was what can the Collcg: do to

become more involved in the
sustainability movement. One sugges-
tion was starting an ecological ethics
course similar to one taught at Drake.
Robinson said that the College might
try lnrcgraring environmental literacy
inro all its courses. Spencer added a
few examplcs: an economics course
could cmphasizc that the ”world is not
an infinite baskcr ofgoodies"; or an
Amcrlcan history course could spend
some timc on the environmental im-
pact of settlement.

Caulkins told srudcnts that they
should use thcir power as consumers.
As consumers, he said, students can
spcnd their money on practices that
support sustainability, llkc community
supportcd agriculture. Caulkins addcd
that studcnts should also use all (h:
institutions availablc to them.

sustainability movcment at Gtinncll,

tion Group at moim@ar.gvin.edu. If
