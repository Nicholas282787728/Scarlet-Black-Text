(From Michigan Daily)
Dulllam, N. 11,, May — Arrow
golt 1 our game, is the sport at tho
dav at New Hdmpsllil'é cuiicge. it is
played with how and arrow instead
or cluh and hall and target; or straw
sacks are used to mark what in goll‘
would he holes. The hiculty have
taken to it in a body and play daily
over a nine tar-get course. Under.
graduates also have adopted the game.
Over the hills and throhgh woodlots
1n the vicinity o[ the college the ar-
rows are sped without need to con.
sulcr- ground conditions that would he
lldzz in real gale: Yet. the game
has qualities that make it lligllly coin.
pcti \‘e, with iactors of strength and
511111 involved to a degree that main.
taius interest.
The coursc at Durham has nine
"holes," 01' target These cons t at
sacks siutlcd w' h straw, placed on

the or x inches chore tire ground.
The distance. between the targets are
troiii 200 to 600 yards. The average
players can make a drive of 200 yard
easily. The game, as in gull requires
that the circuit be made in the least
number of “strucks.”
targets or the present course are pos-
sible one-shot plays as there are pos-
sihlc one hole 111 gulf, though the
prohahility that they will he achlel ed
in one shot is remote.

The ar ow golt player requires little
equipment. Most oi the play'els carry
one how, two or three arrows in a
home made qllivcl‘, and u guard tor-
tlrc lett wrist necessary because the
string strikes down on the wrist with
great mice. The player also wears a
glove on the hand with which he pulls
ilic howstring, or at least tin-cc ring.
