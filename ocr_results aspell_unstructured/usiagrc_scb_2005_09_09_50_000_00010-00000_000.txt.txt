Bush must take responsibility

thn will the Bush administration take responsibils
ity? When will our government admit it has acted wrongly?
thn will someone in power resign or be tired for failing or
lying?

Of the many thoughts swirling in my
head after watching the documentary
Central Ram at Harris the other night,
these were the questions that wouldn’t go
away. The ehps shown in the [rim that
were taken from Al-Jazeera, the Arab sat—
ellite news station, were foreign at times, [he war
but too oftcn the were all too familiart . ,

The movie begins with President Bush WWW/”hell
broadcasting his ultimatum to Saddam
Hussein to leave Iraq. Forty-eight hours
before invading the country, our president stressed the threat
orlraq’s weapons of mass destruction and Saddam’s ties to
terrorists.

A5 of today, nearly 2, 000 are dead,
In addition, tens afthouiandr of
Iraqi civilians are dead betause of
The mission remains

No weapons of mass destruction were found and we’ve
stopped looking. No threatening ties to terrorists ever ex—
isted.

Then there was Jessica Lynch. She became Famous for
her hcroic battle under fire and subsequent
reseue by us. troops. The movie doesn’t
mention the fact that nearly evelything he-
roic about Jessica Lynch's story never hope
peaed.

She had no bullet wounds. She was
injured in a car crash. Her rescuers didn’t
face any resistance. And the administration
never tried to dispel the myth, the legend,
the good RR. our domestic media was till
too eager to sell.

A little later, the ﬁlm reminded us of President Bush
(outing Victory in front ofa banner proclaiming Mission Aes
complished, That was May 1,2003.

Fewer than 250 U.S. soldiers had died when he spoke his
words. As oftoday, nearly 2,000 are dead. in addition, tens
of thousands of Iraqis civilians are dead because of the war.
Exact numbers aren't available. The Pentagon doesn’t keep
track oflraqi civilian deaths. The mission remains unaccoms
plished.

Yet, somehow, Bush was re-eleeted. This made it even
more difﬁcult to listen to Donald Rlimsfcld say, “We are
dealing with people who are willing to he to the world to
make their case." He was referring to Aleazeera. There was
no tinge of irony in his voice. No glimpse that he saw any
hypocrisy in what he was saying. Last November, most Vols
ing Americans seemed to be OK with that Why? I don't
know.

And so I left the theater wondering: When we will we
force our government to take responsibility? When will we
take responsibility for our government?
