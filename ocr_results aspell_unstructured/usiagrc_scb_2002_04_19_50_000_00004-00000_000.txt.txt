Puliizer Prize-winning puei Carolyn Kizei appeared in iire South Lounge
Tuesday night for (he Grinnell Writei’s Conference, She read a number of her
poems for the large audience, a mix of students, iaculiy and Grinnell
residents. Kizei proved that she was just as talented a speaker as she was a
poet. Ralph Savarese, English, descn‘hed her as a terriﬁc and "very
mischievous" speaker.

Kizer appeared at Grinnell 25 years ago when She was in‘lowa City in
the Iowa Writers Workshop. ”I fell in love with the place,” she said. "I have
very tender feelings about [Grinnell],” Kizer emphasized that she did not
want Gridnell smdenls to remember her solely as the ”Pulitzer Prize—
winning poet"

”1 would like to be seen as a feminist who feels that feminism and
ecology are absolulely intertwined,” she said. ”You can’t wani women lo -
have a break wiinout giving‘tne universe a break too." —Whi'tney our
