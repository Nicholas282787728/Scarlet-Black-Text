SOME BASKET BALL DOPE.

Tho basket ball men and those inn
tel-estcd in the sport are rejoicing “ox-
ceeding much" these days over the an-
lloullcement that Captain George MC-
llrath, who has ﬁlled the center posi-
tion so acceptably the past two years,
will again register in the College this
semester. There lldd been some l‘nv
mm to the effect that he would not
rorcgister, which had caused a sort of
gloom over the whole situation.

With this announcement and with
the increased spi it which is getting
into the play there is no need for
anyone to be tlespoiirlcllt over the sit-
uation, and although we have lost two
important games by 'ai-ious scores,
we are by no means out of tlic fight
tor the state championship.

Klein, wllo has been inst a triﬂe oif
color since the (Joe game, played in
exccllciit form during the ﬁrst hart
last night and sccmcd almost in his
last year's shallot For thc other tor-
ward, the Iolll'»60l'llered light between
Rowell, Cartel, McCarty and Munson
is still on, although Manson has play-
on the important games and seems to
