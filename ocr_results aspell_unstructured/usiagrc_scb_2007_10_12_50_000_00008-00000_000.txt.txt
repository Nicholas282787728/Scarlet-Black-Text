“Bag forms” and other ceramics pieces
featured at sculpture show downtown

BY SARAH MIRK

The Grinncll Community Art Gallery is
a long, narrow room housed in the large and
usually vacant Grinnell community Building
on Park Street, an odd cement building bet-
ter know tor its gym and drivers heense other.
Nevertheless, last Friday afternoon, a dozen
local arts enthusiasts mingled on the second
ﬂoor, filling the ﬂuorescently-lit hallway wrth
conversation as they munched on delicious
chocolatercovered shortbread cookies. Such a
scene is unmistakable, regardless of the con-
text: an art opening.

ceramist Jessica DC. Lease, a University
of Iowa grad and local pottery teacher, was
among friends as she unveiled her exhibition
at the gallery, now up until Oct, 25

The centerpieces of Lensc‘s exhibition are
a series oftall, tawny amorphous shapes For
lack of better description, these pieces were
described unpretentiously throughout the gals

lery opening as “bag torrris."They,1ilce all the
wotlt in the show, are marked by a natural, or
ganic quality to their linc57thc edges are not
smooth nor their shapes geometric, They sit
together on blocks and reach upward, splitting
at the top like a mouth or uneven vase rim to
reveal a hollow interior glazed deep red with
iron oxidc. “I sit and think about what shapes
and terms appeal to me,”exp1ained Lease,who
fills sketchbooks with drawings of different
interesting shapes “These pieces are figurrlt
tiveerhey're ﬁgures without faces,"

Also included in the exhibit are several
more traditionally ﬁgurative piee : small, ﬂat
ceramic faces lie on the carpet at the back of
the room. encircling an object resembling a
beehive “it looks like they’re having a family
rcu onl"exclaimed the openings host, former
Grinnell sculpture professor Merle lekic.

“There’s a universality to faces,"saitl Lease,

“everyone can associate something with a face.
his not so removed that people don’t know
what to think ofrt."

Lease herself is a recent addition to the
Grinnell’s arts scene. This is her first show
since movrng here two years ago, and Lease
herselfis still trying to Figure out whether she
can make a living as an artist in a small town.
“It would be really great to move to a bigger
community," said the Iowa native, smiling at
the mention of New York, “but it's also good
to try and get artists to stay and ﬁgure out the
community."

The Community Art Gallery itself is one
of the projects of thc Grinncll Community
Arts Council, an organization that is work-
“lg to build a strong local theater dance and
art scene. Via the Arts Council, Lease teaches
weekly pottery classes at an Art Factory north
of town.

A Moroccan
Goddess In
Grinnell

I meant to use this title the moment I saw
sculptor Iktam Kabbaj in action on the uncle
field, So dcdrcated, working on her marble,
like a lover courting her hard, sometimes une
responsive beloved. But here lies the pleasure,
all the pleasures in the Arab convention of
courtly love: the harder, the crueler the marble
beloved, the more loving, bent in love, like an
Islamic arch in an ancient mosque, the lover
becomes. it is raw pain for the two sides, pain
oflove, love’s labor that is so deep it hits the
roots where pleasure/pain is indistinguishable.

Guest Column
Saadi Simawe,

The other day she was holding her marble
model in one hand close to her breast. rocking
it as she was saying "This is my baby."Thrs
dedicated love, artist’s love, is surely capable of
discovering the heart in the hardest marble, an
Alabama inaiblcwuhout this kind ofardent,
singleemiiidcd, near religious love, the marble
would never glvt‘ shape.

passion, ever
persistent and
assertive, finds
its own ways even in the most selerepressed
religious devotees. Despite their own religion,
they find themselves insinuating their artistic
passion, or rather their artistic passion insinr
uat‘ing itself in form of nr‘abesques, at in the
stunningly beautrful calligraphy or the Qur'an
and the intoxicating power of the er’anic
chanting.

The artist, even when he or she, out of
belief in the blasphemy of art suppresses ar-
tistic urges, will inevrtably and unconsciously
create a palrnodc. Hence the essence of our
humanity: it is in this eternal wrestling with
God that the artist asserts hcr equally divine
nature. Imagine a world without God, and we
will have a foreboding vision eta world where
every thing is lawﬁtl and permissible. Imagine
a world without artist, it means the complete
absence ofthe salubl‘rous challenge and advent
(lucitlrat emptiness would bore even a icalr
ous God.
