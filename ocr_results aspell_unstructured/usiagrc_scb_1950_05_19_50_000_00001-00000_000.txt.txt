The only real fear that the

a socialism that is an outgl'dwth

In Russia there is a “const-

Error Escapes

Notice; Oldest
Paper ‘New’ Yet

By Alice Loch

There are some eager beaver
copyreaders on the 5&3 stuff.
But there are times when errors
slip by even their thorough
gaze, as delegates to the gone
but-notefol'gotten Newton Con.
ference can testify.

We notice that the typograph—
ical errors were occasionally at
tributed to this year’s staff, but
there, we raise an objection. It
seems that along about the end
of September, 1945, in the editor
of the 5&3 decided to have a
new name~p1ate made (For the
reader‘s edificaticn, a nameplate
is a plate with the name of
the newspaper on it. Simple,
am).

it was then that the classic
typo was made In the hectic
rush, the plate/Was used, and
has been used ever since. To
our knowledge no one has no—
ticed it until this year.

When it was pointed out, we
decided that it would be a nice
tradition to leave it as is. Per
help: it could be used as a read-
er observance test for entering
freshmen, or in a beginning
journalism class. Take a look at
the nameplate ndw. How do you
spell “newspaper?"

Pi‘oduci‘ion Class
