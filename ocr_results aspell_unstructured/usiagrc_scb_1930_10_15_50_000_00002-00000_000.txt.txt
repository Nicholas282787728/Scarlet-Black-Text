FILL THE STADIUM
(From the Des Monies Tribuuc-(klpitnl)

Drake university is making strenuous efforts to
ﬁll the 15,000 seats of her stadium for the homecoming
football game with Grinhell, Friday evening, Oct. 17.
She is sending speakers to various organizations and
is offering reduced prices to school children.

The battle for the old oaken bucket will be evenly
matched and hard fought. Both teams have been saving
their energy for this contest, and both will be as anxious
to win this game as any on their fan schedules. The
spectacular aspect of the event will be enhanced by the
playing of the Drake and Grinnell bands and by a mob,
ster display of ﬁreworks.

Des Moines people should see this game not only
because Drake university is a civic institution which
deserves local support, but also because they will enjoy
the gridiron scrap and the excitement which accompan—
ies it. It will be the biggest athletic event of the season
in Des Moines, and those who miss it will be losers.

he was abandoned in Sandakan, Bor-

From lmere he went. to Zamboaugo.

interested in him and gave him free
access to the Bible that. the Jesuit

Soon he became a missionary, coh-
verting many Mohammedans. He
married and worked on various is-
lands as an interpreter. When his
mother learned that he was her long
lost son, she came to him and the
three sailed north to see Matias'
tether.

An interesting story connected
with the sailing concerns the meet
ing of an armed pirate sloop. The
young missionary quickly uncovered
a small pipe-organ which he used,
and played the twenty-third psalm,
singing it in the Moro dialect. The
brigands, being Moros, questioned the
party and learned that they were
headed for Baa Nonok,

"We seek Bapa Sahid there,” said
Matias.

“He is my uncle," declared the pir-

“He is my Cousin,” was the

Upon the eventual meeting of the
father and son, the Christian teacher
asked the Mohammedan if he would
not be converted. "But; what would
I do with all my wives ‘2" asked his
father. However the conversion took
place.

Freshman Battlers Swamp
Sophomores, 20-9, to Win
in Annual Class Contest

Grinnell College freshmen availed
themselves at their one opportunity
to battle the sophomores Monday
night and did it in a thorough fash-
ion, winning the new style freshman-
sophomore Class Scrap, 20 L0 9. The
yearlings had things their own way
during most of the battle, leading 10
to 5 at the end of the first: half. The
fight took place on Ward field under
the lights.

The sophomores were badly out-
numbered but managed to put up a
stiff battle, particularly when the
number of sacks on the ﬁeld narrow-
ed down. There were no serious injur-
ies during the fracas although some
of the boys were forced out by sheer
exhaustion.

The sophomores made a desperate
bid to even the number of contest—
ants before the opening of the battle,
when they stormed the rooms of
some of the yearlings, bound them,
and were about to spirit them away
when one of the house chairmen
stopped the proceeding.
