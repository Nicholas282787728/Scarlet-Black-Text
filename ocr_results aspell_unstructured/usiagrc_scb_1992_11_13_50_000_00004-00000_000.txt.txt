or several policemen. These poilccmun
made sure that one or my rellow Pro-
Choicers was not attacked or’dio not go

As the rally grew feelings became
more and more intense. We yelled our
chams while they ycllod theirs. Both sides
were so passionate lhal the rally quickly
evolved into an intense war tilled wrth
screams and shaking risls. l chamod along
