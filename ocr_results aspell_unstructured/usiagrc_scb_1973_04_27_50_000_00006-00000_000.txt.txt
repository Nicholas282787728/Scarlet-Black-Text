The Iconoclast

 

by Gregg Daffnei-

Probably the most disasterous fail—
we of all the government undertake
ings has been public education. The
extent and depth of this failure is
observable all around us, The der
gree or drug addiction among the
young, and the phenomenal scope of
functional illiteracy are but two of
its symptoms.

One might expect, in the ince of
such disaster, that the government’s
performance in the field of educa—
tion would be questioned Instead,
to add insult to injury, the governr
ment is demanding more money .
in a period of national economic
crisis — to continue spreading the
destruction further

For those who wish to “do some
ething" in politics and really want
to accomplish Something of value
there isapractical alternative Here
is an opportunity to unite manypeo-
ple oi different viewpoints in an ad
hoc movement.

The speciiically deiined goal oi
such a movement is: tax credits
for education. .

While the idea is not new (dire
ferent versions of it have been perr
iodically submitted to congress but
defeated in committee) the evidence
of the critical need tor such a pro-

(from

BlOOMFIElD pager)

mittee from CBS in order to pre-
vent any duplications oi eiiort. She
commented that she felt the film of-
ierings this year have been excelv
lent, and wants to continue the tra-
dition.
When questioned about her own
desires for next year, Ms. Bloomr
, field mentioned several ideas whr
ich she would like to see take
shape. There is a possibility that
.'tr2nsportation may be arranged for
those interested in attending con-
certs in Des Moines and Iowa City.
Ms. Bloomfield would like to see
the South Lounge used more inforr
mally, ior impromptu periormances
and student gatherings, and wants
to take every advantage oi good
weather and hold many outdoor eve
cnts. This may even include an “exr
travaganza" at Rock Creek Park
or a rock festival here on campus.
In sum, M5. Bloomfield sees the
possibility of an extremely full and
varied social calendar lornexiyear,
despite financial limitations, if her
office and the Social Committe in-
vestigate and take advantage of ev-
ery avenue possible.

the Static: nun idiotic

gram has never been as clear or as
great.

Essentially the idea goes on as
iollows: an individual would be gi-
ven Iaxrcredits ior the money which
he spends on education. This in-
cludes his own education, his chi —
dren’s, or any other person‘s whr
ich he puts through a bona-iide
school of his choice (primary, see
condary, and higher education),

The upper limits or what he can
spend on any one person (receiving
tax—credits) would be equal to what
it costs the government to provide
a student with a comparable educa-
tion.

if a students parents are too poor
to pay for his education or to pay
income taxes, and if he cannot find
a private sponsor to finance him,
the public schools would still be
open to him, as they are presently,
with the added likelihood that these
schools would be greatly improved
by the decreased pressure oi over.
crowding, and by the iniluence of
a variety of private schools.

Although i have made it clear in
the past, l want to emphasize that
I do not advocate the government's
“right” to control a Citizen's spr
ending through tax—incentives. Tn-
ese would not exist in a free ec0n~
omy, However, we live in a danger—
ously mixed economy and while it
can’t he fixed overnight, at least
this proposal would be a step in
the right direction and further, it
is a means of averting an immedr
late disaster.

While the government contemplates
the addition oi more taxes (in the
form oi a so.called ”value—added
tax"), at a time when the country
is staggering under the present or
ushing tax burden, this proposal
would do the following; The costs
or education would be borne dlr~
ectly by those who now pay them
indirectly - by individual citizens,
with public schools still in exis—
tence and iinanced out or general
tax revenues, parents would have
a choice, they could either send
their childre‘n to free public sch-
ools and pay their taxes in full,
or pay tuition to a private school,
with money saved irom their taxes.
It would give private schools a
chance to survive. it would bring
their tuition fees within the reach
at the majority of the people. It
would decentralize education, open
it to competition, and thus to a
free marketplace oi ideas.

it would destroy the humongous,

education bureaucracy of the gov
ernment, reducing it to a reasonr
ab_le size. To give you an idea
of the inconceivable amount ofmon-
ey this would save, 1 submit the
following: it has been estimated
that the Job Corps spent $9,210
to $13,000 per year per enrollee;
at some camps, the iigure reached
$27,000 and even $39,205, At pri—
vate residential schools giving vo-
cational training, the cost ranged
from $2,300 to $2,600 per Student
per year. (Shirley Sheiola, poverty
is Where the Money is, New Roche
elle, N.Y., Arlington House, 1968).

At present, the biggest spender of
government funds and the recipient
of tax money in the national budget
is the Department of Health, Educa-
tion, and Welfare.

As we are increasingly realizing,
private universities (and colleges)
are being ground out of existence
by the products of two government
policies; the reduction oi private
contributions (taken away by taxes),
and rising costs (caused by inflation,
as a result of government spending).
Lastly state universities with nom-
inal teas are another factordestroy»
ing the chances of private uni~
versilies to survive. Theproblem is
clear, no private concern can com-
pole with a government institution
for long because it is a contest wh-
ere one contestant has unlimited
funds, some of which are takenfi‘om
the other, and in which one contes-
tant is forced to obey the rules set
by the other. If private schools sur-
vive, it will be in name only especr
ially with the assistance of federal
funds. “The power to disburse gov-
ernment funds is the power to rule."

There will, of course, be those who
will oppose the program on the grou-
nds that it will foster the develop
ment of different educational theorr
ies, and methods in the various
private schools. But alas, the anSr
wet" to these people is that that is
exactly one of the program’s goals.
Essential to a free country’s pros
grass are differences, not regimenr
ted uniformity.

The opposition will be especially
great trim the educational estabr
lishment and from those bureaur
crats whose source of income is a
government job. Their proported
goal is to provide education not to
control this country’s intellectual
life. Those who are really concern-
ed with the growth of statism, now
is the time to seize the opportunity
and hold the educational establish
ment to their word.

Air Quality: ISPIRG Protest

The lowa Student public Interest
Research Group (lSPlRG) presented
testimony last Tuesday at a public
hearing conducted by the lowa Air
Quality Commission,

A spokesman for iSPiRG testiiied
against a proposed change in the air
quality regulations concerninga sul-
iur dioxide emissions rate increase
for sulfuric acid manuiacturing pl—
ants. The proposed change would in-
crease the 1975 allowable suliur di-
oxide emissions irom 6.5 pounds
per ton oi acid produced to 30 poe
unds per ton oi acid.

The two suliuric acid plants which
would be attested by the change
are U.S, industrial Chemicals, lo»
cated in oubuque, and the Area
Chemical company, in Fort Madi-
son.

ISPlRG contends that the suliur
dioxide monitoring in Fort Madison
which has been performed to date
is inadequate to prove that iederal
secondary ambient air quality Stan»
dards will be met and that public
health will not be jeopardized,

with: gold

ISPIRG also states that the Air Qual»
ity Implementation Plan requires
the Dubuque region to reduce suliur
dioxide emissions by the Same a-
mount as in the sample region for
sulfur dioxide Control in the stale.

ISPIRG testimony asserts that the
Air Quality commission can not
allow an increase in sulfur dioxide
emissions until this reduction is unr
questionahly achieved.

According to testimony, sulfur
dioxide and sulfuric acid, which is an
atmospheric byproduct oi suliur
dioxide, are two of the most haz—
ardous forms of air pollution. Small
quantities of these chemicals in the
air can cause respiratory problems
in people, particularly the elderly,
the very young, and those with im-
paired health.

The lSPIRG spokesman stated that
the present emissions regulations
should be retained until it is proven
that the proposed change wtllneither
endanger public health nor adversely
affect the environment.
