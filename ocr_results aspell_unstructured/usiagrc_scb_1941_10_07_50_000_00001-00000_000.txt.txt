Griniicll graduates are employed
or otherwise occupied, according
to figures released by the place-
ment office today,

' Fifty»six are employed in social
service and teaching, 51 are
working in business offices, 12
are in defense work, and 13 are
taking graduate studies.

Five women in this group are
married and four graduates have
not informed the office of their
occupations.

Demand Continues.

The demand for graduates is
continuing, though the peak of
employment season. has passed,
Maurice D. Woolte, director of
the placement bureau, said

The majority of calls are from
school superintendents needing
teachers, and many requests are
for technicians, although in the
latter case, graduates cannot be
provided because of the lack of
technical subjects offered at Grins
nell.

Wooltc Comments.

Commenting on placement this
spring, Woolfc said it would prob-
ably follow the same pattern,
with social studies and teaching
taking the most graduates, and
office and business work, the
next largest group. The only
noticeable change is that more
and more students are going into
graduate work, he added.

Reporter Finds Spanish Threatening To Oust English
As Grinnell’s Language; Enrollment Figures Soar

Pan-Americanism
Said to Be Cause of
Increased Interest

By Catherine Funk
“Husm mas turtle, mi amigo,"
will be a virtual requisite for
campus conversation in Grinncll
soon, if present trends in Spanish
class enrollments continue.

The largest enrollment in any
single langiage course in the
history of the college is repre-

sented by the 135 Spanish stu-
dents this year, according to
Bethana McCandlesS, registrar.
Spanish itself has not enjoyed
such popularity in Grllmell since
the years of thc first World War,
she said

“Emphasis on PuneAmel'icztnlsm
in the United States as a whole
has undoubtedly had great effect
on the study of the language,"
Miss Mccandless commented.
“Spanish has always enjoyed
popularity during times of Euro—

pean conflict. During World War
1, our German courses were un-
usually small, and Spanish classes
were crowded. Wc look for con»
tinued popularity at least as long
as the war lasts."

With five sections of first year,
and two of second year Spanish,
the modern language department
has added a professor exclusively
for Spanish

Dr Gabriel Eugen-and is the
first professor to hold that posi-
tion sincc the Spanish depart-
ment’S golden days of 1915.

Registrar Says
Cut Changes
Were Necessary

Attendance under the new
‘cut’ regulations is being
taken by special student moni-
tors, according to Bethalla
McCandless, registrar.

Special class enrollment lists
have been prepared for recording
attcndance, she said, In classes of
less than 25 students, professors
are responsible for these Jeoords.
1n larger classes they are being
assisted by student monitors.

”It is imperative that students
realize this attendance Check in
no way alters the ’n -cut' system
initiated this year," Miss Me-
Candless said. ”Attendance is be-
ing taken only to serve as a
record for the student’s own use.
Employers often make inquiries
about a graduates regularity and
promptness in attendance.

Under thc cut system origi-
nated this year, freshmen, sopho-
more transfers, and any students
not filling the 15 grade average
are not allowed unexcused ab—
sences.

cuts by these students should
be reported by them to the Dean
of women or to the Men's coun-
selor immediately to obtain ex-
cuses, the registrar said.

Work missed in excused or un-
excused absences must be made
up according to directions of the
professor, she added.

Change in the cut system of
previous years was felt necessary,
according to Miss McCanolless,
with the revision of class sche-
dules.

With every course in Grinnell
now a four hour course, the old
penalty of loss of one hour’s
credit for excessive absences
would mean losing four hour's
credit. since no makerup course
of less than four hours could be
taken. A new system was the
only solution. she explained.

Student monitor positions are
not regular college jobs, Miss
McCandless said. They are as-
signed to students most likely to
be consistently present, Payment
is $6.00 a semester.
