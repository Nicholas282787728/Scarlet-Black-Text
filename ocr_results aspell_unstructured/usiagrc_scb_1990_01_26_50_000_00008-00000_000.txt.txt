senior music major Sam Pcrlman
had his way, musiceducution would
also include the study of music by
Kay, Freeman. and Still.

Ulysses Kay, Harry Lawrence
Freeman, and William Grant Still

ers,Perlman says. “They 're among

especially. deserves to be studied
along with Aaron Copland and
Charles Ives," he adds. "Those
three are kind of a Lriumvirate of
great American composers.“

But most people aren‘t familiar
with the works of Still—or of other
black composers. Perlman thinks
that this ignorance is due to a defi-
ciency in music texts, which tend to
focus only on white, male compos-
ers. Perlman is determined to rein»
edy that deﬁciency—and to make
people aware of the importance of
blacks in music history.

Perlman spent the summer in
Grinnell as an Associated Colleges
of the Midwest Minority Scholar.
While researching theplace of black
classical music in the curriculum,
Perlman found a “distressing” ten;
dency for major music textbooks
and anthologies to ignore the work
of black composers.

Perlman examined more than 20
major music texts, including the
Prentice-Hall History of Music
Series and Donald Grout's “His
[cry of Western Music," a book
used in more titan 90 peroentof all
music history courses. “None of
thehistorytextscontaincdanybasic
information on black composers,”
he says. “Those that mentioned
black composers did so only pe-

Senior Sam Perlman contemplates the role of Black

composers

ripherally or parenthetically.”
Perlman also discovered that none
ofthemusic theory texts orantholo-
gies hestudied contained any musi-
cal examples by black composers.

To make matters worse, the tem
hadchangedlitllesince1973, when
Dominique-Rene de Lenna con-
ducted the first study of blacks in
the music curriculum.

Perlman said that while he wasn't
really surprised by his ﬁndings, he
was disappointed,“especially since
there's been so little change in the
last 16 years. It’s no wonder that
even musically literate people were
surprised when I told them I’d be
researching black composers this
summer," he said. A lot of them
didn't know there were any imporr
Iant black composers to study,“

Perlman has outlined the results
of his summer research in an article
that was published in the Septem»
ber 1989 issue of the "CBMR Reg
isler.“ In addition, Perlman has taken
several steps Ioeducaiepeopleabout
the role of blacks in music history.
As part of his ACM fellowship,

Perlman devised a timeline that
included impomnt dates in the
history of black music. He also
developed a series of teaching aids,
including a guide to black compos
ers. And he’s urged his professors
to incorporate musical examples by
black composers into their classes,

But Perlman believes it will take
several more years before black
music is given the full attention it
deserves. "There’s still racism to
be overcome,“ he explained.
"People have to be able to get past
the notion that music written by
blacks is relevant only to blacks.

“Most people have this idea that
all classical music was written by
old, white, Gen-nan men,“ Perlman
says. “But classical music is more
than that. The only way to getblack
youth involved with classical mu«
sic is to show them artists—past
and presentiwith whom they can
identify. They need to realize that
blacks have a history of participa-
tion in the arts. Only then will they
feel comfortable about getting in
Volved with the arts."
