Men’s Basketball

The Grinnell College men's basketball
team begins a string of six end—of-thes
season Midwest Conference tilts by facing
Carleton on the road and taking on Coe at
home.

Grinnell split early season matches with
the two clubs, taking a 77459 home decision
from Carleton in December and dropping
an azos game at Cue in January.

“It was good to win a close one,” Harvey
said after his Pioners repulsed a Ripon
comeback bid and outlasted the Redmen,
55-57, in a loop engagement at Darby Gym
last Saturday. The victory upped
Grinnell's league mark to 3-5.

Grinnell raced to a 17-4 pad during the
early going and was in front 36-21 at the in-
termission, Battling back, Ripon tied the
score, 4646, midway through the second
stanza. It was anyone's game the rest of
the way, with the lead changing hands
numerous times.

No free throws by Tim Dick with 20
seconds remaining gave Grinnell its final
6857 margin.

“We played well in the first half and kept
our composure while fighting off Ripon
during the final 10 minutes,” Harvey
noted.

He cited Dennis Blyly for playing a fine
game. in addition to directing the attack,
Blyly led the Pioneers with 21 points. He
hit seven of eight free throw attempts and
made {our in a row during the closing
minutes. John Scholz notched 13 points.
and Dick had 12. Dick grabbed 15 re-
bounds, and Jim Niemeyer claimed 10.

Basketball improves with time

by Kevin Rhodes

After Saturday's 68-67 win over Ripon,
the Grinnell men‘s basketball team. under
the direction of Head Coach John Harvey,
took a 4~11 record into last Tuesday night’s
game with Iowa Wesleyan. At first glance,
one might be tempted to discuss this as
just another weak showing by a Grinnell
athletic program, but considering the re-
cent history of the basketball teams here
at Grinnell, this record represents quite an
Improvement.

Harvey, now in his third year as head
coach, inherited a program whose last
winning season occurred before any of the
present squad members were born. After
'winning the conference championship dur7
ing the 196162 season, Grinnell teams have
suffered through 21 straight losing years
(including this year), among them Art
Peterson's humiliating 0—22 slate the year
before Harvey arrived.

“When I came here. the morale was
really rotten,” admits Harvey. His first
two teams went on to post dismal 3719 and
2-20 records tone win was by forfeit).

Many students may remember those
years when Darby Gymnasium often
resembled a morgue in more ways than
one. Not only was fan support practically
nonexistent at times’, but the team’s
methodical half court offensive style made
it difficult for those who did show up to re-
main awake Tu Harvey, those seasons
must have dragged on like a 3:15 class on
Friday afternoon. The teams were racked
with internal problems and suffered
through the loss of many talented players.
"If the team were winning consistently,
there would be fewer people on campus
saying they can do a better job than the
people out there,” replied Harvey.

» Although it would be extremely
premature to suggest that Harvey has
begun to turn the program around, at least
the team is gaining some respectability.

leader Monmouth, which many consider

the team's best showing all year, the Man»
mouth assistant coach remarked. “This is
the best Grinnell team I've seen in at least
the last fifteen years," “It's been slower
progress than I had hoped," commented
Harvey, ”but we've got a strong base
now.”

The team started uie year surprisingly
well, w say the least. After a to point opens
ing game loss to George Williams, an
NAIA school, Grinnell won at Mt. St.
Claire and Cornell. Following a loss to Nor-
thwestern College, Grinnell beat Carleton
at home. The final game before semester
break was in Darby against the weak Mt.
St. Claire team, and everyone expected
Grinnell to finish ﬁle 1952 segment of the
season at 4-2. Unfortunately, no one told

Mt. st, Claire that, and the Pioneers gave
away a close game.

Granted, the competition was not as
tough in the early part of the season, but
that factor was more than balanced by the
loss of Jim Niemeyer, a second team All-
Midwest Conference center as a freshman
last year. Niemeyer missed the first eight
games this season after suffering a broken
arm in a preseason pole vaulting acci-
dent.

Of course, when Harvey speaks of a
“strong base now,” he is referring to the
addition ofDennis Blyly and Dave Dorsey,
both starting freshmen guards. Blyly is a
hardworking point guard good for forty
minutes Of hustle at both ends of the court,
while Dorsey's outgoing style has made
him a favorite with the Grinnell fans.

The young Pioneer team demonstrated
its inconsistency in dropping the first eight
games of 1983. Win or lose, at least the
team has been fun to watch. The games
have been close, but more importantly, the
offensive has opened up. Last year at this
time Darby was still awaiting the first fast
break, but now the Pioneers run whenever
possible. “We couldn’t change our style
before this year," said Harvey, “but now,
with the addition of Dorsey and Blyly, we
have added quickness and better
ballhandlers,”

The team is very young and not yet
mature and experienced, and this has hurt
them in several of the close games.
Juniors Mike Neely and Ralph staples,
said Harvey, have “really contributed a
lot of experience and confidence off the
bench.”

Grinnell still has a chance to improve on
its record this year. There are several
teams of comparable ability left on the
schedule. The improved play has brought
the normally passive Grinnell crowds into
the games much more this season, and
Harvey gives them considerable credit for
the team's success. “The crowds have
definitely been better and that's helped a
lot,” he added, “Close games bring the
fans out."

Harvey‘s goals are very optimistic, “I'm
content with what we have now, because
we can be competitive in the conference
with this group of players. We want to keep
them together for the next few years," he
commented.

In terms of longer range ambitions,
Harvey said he “wants to be around .500
every year and challenge for the con-
ference championship some of those
years " That may or may not be possible
here at Grinnell, but if it is, Darby Gym-
nasium may eventually replace the Pub as
the hottest spot on campus.
