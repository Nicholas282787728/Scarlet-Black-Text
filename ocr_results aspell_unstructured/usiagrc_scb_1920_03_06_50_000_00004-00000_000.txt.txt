Today and Tomorrow

The sophomore girls team romped
on their junior sisters to the tune
of 12—3 in a haskethall game played
in Band Gymnasium this morning.
This settles the tie score which two
Cxtm pe iods were unable to break
in thc initial battle between these two
redouhtshle teams which was played
some time ago. The game was fear
lured both by good team—work and
close guarding.

The game started slowly, neither
side scoring tor some time. The even—
ly matched playing kept the score
down throughout the ﬁrst halt, which
ended with a tie, 4—4. In the last
six minutes of play the sophomores
pushed their score up rapidly, caging
twice as many ﬁeld goals as the inn—
iors. j ,

lgot two points and put the score at

thirty before the game ended.

The teamwork, passing and doors
work of both quintets was excellent,
and the entire lack of fumbling help-
ed make a test game. Cornell‘s vot-

l’ECK’S RAD BOY.

In these days of crooks and white
slave plays ﬁend plays dealing with
the sex problem, it is indeed a reliez
and a pleasure to announce the come
ing of a. play depending on none of
these subjects [or a framework, but

Iinstead depending tor its success on

cleanliness, laughter. song and the
spirit at youth. , e

We reler to “Puck's Bad Buy." a.
play made from the famous Bad Boy

ol a century ago.
The Bad Boy sketches jumped into
instant favor and their author became
famous over-night. The sketches
were made into play torm later and
achieved instant and apparently un-
ending popularity.
ﬁe company appearing here is the
best this well known comedy has ever
had. The scenery is all new and the
Bad Boy is the same lovable chap
you have always known. The date
01' their appearance at the Colonial
Theatre is Monday, March 15.
