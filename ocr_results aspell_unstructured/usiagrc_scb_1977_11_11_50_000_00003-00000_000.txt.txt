Capital campaign given OK

The college’s plans to raise
approximately $18 million in
capital were approved by the
Grinnell Board of Trustees last
weekend following what was
referred to by one trustee as an
“upbeat” discussion of the
campaign.

Discussion at the meeting
centered around raising money to
fund three areas of a “need table"
formulated by the college ad»
ministration:

1) Operating coss (estimated at
$4 million over the next five
years);

2) “bricks and mortar" items
(renovation of dorms, Goodnow
Hall and Grinnell House, eXr
pansion of Burling Library and the
science building library, con-
struction of a ”very basic, core
building" at Conard Biology
Preserve, and addition of an art
gallery to the Fine Arts Building);

3) endowments for the enrich-
ment of academic life (to be
allotted for teaching professor»

said.

CAROLYN Bucksbaunl,
chairman of the Board of the
Trustees, believes that the ethical
problems involving stock
ownership have been considered
by the trustees.

“Ethical considerations have
been in the minds of those in the
finance Committee for some time.
The students made it more focused
than it has been. As a Board, there
is considerable feeling that we
should reflect an ethical view of
society. We wouldn't just consider
the stock solely as profit poten
tial," she said.

Vice Chairman John Norris
praised the plan, which calls for a
long»range, gradual expansion
within the existing walls. The plan
was excepted in principle but not
worked out in detail because the

not yet been raised.

compared the need table to “a
menu" from which things are
selected and 'ven priority, and
explained that s an expression of
the needs of the institution, rather

than its wants or desires.
“Will we for sure do all these

things? Not necessarily. A need

these things. It‘s the hope that you
can raise the money to do them,"
he said.

SGA President Jon Neiderbach
felt that the decision of the Board
was not specific enough,

“I wish they had been more
explicit in stating their position
and had given more specific in»
formation about how they would
vote on a proxy," In reviewing the
guidelines, he thought the item
about the college stating no
position on political issues was
“absurd." He lhinks the SGA
should “make sure the apparent
intent of the trustees is carried
through monitoring how the
college votes on proxies, and
should make sure the Trustees on
the finance committee are in
formed on the specific issues
related to the proxy voting.

Trustees review

Affirmative Action »

By Kathy Willhoite

Last Friday night, as part of the
Board of Trustees’ weekend-long
meeting, the Board’s official ad
hoc committee on Affirmative
Action met to discuss the im-
plications of Grinnell College's
Affirmative Action policy,

The subcommittee reported to
the Board and suggested new
faculty recruiting approaches to
aid in the implementation of the
Grinnell Affirmative Action policy.
These suggestions included using
Grinnell alumni to informally
inquire about and speak with
qualified potential minority and
women faculty members. The
trustees, according to committee
member James Lowry, feel that
advertising for faculty members in
journals alone is not good enough,
and that more hours need to be
devoted to talking to people about
Grinnell.

THE COMMITTEE also feels

that the college must be ﬂexible in
its expectations of the successful
implementation of the Affirmative
Action policy. Since, in reality, it
will be difficult to recruit a large
percentage of minorities, ac-
cording to Lowry, Grinnell may
have to settle on compromises,
such as one or two-semester
faculty exchange programs with
other schools.

The Affirmative Action comr
mittee of the Board of Trustees is
composed of mree trustees, each
with special knowledge and ex-
pertise on the subject of Al-
firmative Action. Lowry is a
mangement consultant for a firm
which specializes in Affirmative
Action. Dennis Homerin of Chicago
describes himself as “a labor
lawyer” who deals with Af~
firmative Action cases, The third
committee member, Elizabeth
Kruidenier of Des Moines,’ also has

enough guarantee that a sufficient
number of women and minorities
Will be hired as faculty. She
recognizes that some have ex
pressed unhappinesss with what
they feel are the low target num»
bets for hiring in the report, but
added that she “gives credence” to
those figures partly because the
document was drawn up by
Eysenbach, a person “whose
strong interest in Affirmative
Action has been amply demon-
strated.” She said, however, that
she is willing to consider higher

Affirmative Action goals if they
are practical, .

“If persons can demonstrate that
higher goals could be met, I would
be pleased to listen to their ways of
accomplishing these goals," she
said,

Bucksbaum also commented
that the effectiveness of the
currentAffirmatiVe Action policies
cannot be judged for some time.

“AT BEST, the resuls won’t
be seen for several years,‘ she
said.

As chairman. one of her major
concerns is the future of liberal
arts education both at a national
leveland here at Grinnell. She said
she was pleased that Turner issued
the White Paper on the future of
the college, but was disappointed
,with its reception.

“I thought the idea of developing
such a paper was an exciting one,
because i thought it would provoke
widespread faculty, student and
alumni participation. It was
neither as widespread or as in-
tensive as I had hoped it would be,
but I think we substantially got the
message that what was wanted
was a traditional role for the
college," she said.

BUCKSBAUM. AS chairman,
appears in touch with the major
issues here on campus. Despite her
relative anonymity, she is a figure
of importance in policy-making
here at the college.
