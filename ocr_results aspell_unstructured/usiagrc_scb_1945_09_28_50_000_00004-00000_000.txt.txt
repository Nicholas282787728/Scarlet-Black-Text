Well, things are shaping up.
The football team has had a
week of practice and the boys
are beginning to swing into '
There are sore muscles and ach-
ing joints; but the spirit of the
boys, Coach Reed testifies, is
good. Worlrouts are held each
afternoon beginning about 3:30
and lasting until about 6:00. The
boys are going to win games or-
die tryingl

As for as a schedule
cerned, nothing is definite. Be-
cause of our not knowing we
would have a football team until
about ten days ago, we are noiv
experiencing a difficulty in are
ranging a schedule, However,
we are hoping for a half season
of four games, probably with
Coe, Cornell. Simpson, or a dou-
ble game with one or two of
these schools.

John Truesdale,
department of physical educa-
tion, is, very optimistic about
Grinnell’s future in basketball.
Letters have been written and]
their answers are now being
awaited as to the definite scher
dule which Grinnell cagers will

’ play. A sixteen or eighteen

game schedule is being arranged
with the possible treat of a game
with Iowa State Teachers college,.
if it is possible.

Until football games get under-;
way, intramural sports under Ptay
O'Bl'iﬂl’s direction will provide
some promised thrills, with touch
football starting the first pal‘t‘
of next weelr. Theofour teams
chosen by the intramural chair-
man are now being scheduled for
a roulldrx‘obil'l contest to be play-
ed on Tuesdays‘and Thursdays,
the designated intramural days.

One last bit of information. Pose
sibly ,and we mean just that,
there Will be a cross-country teaml
working out soon if enough en-
thusiasm can be generated. Dr.
Evertoii, an experienced runner in
this field, will be in charge of the
training of Grinnell's team in
this sport.
