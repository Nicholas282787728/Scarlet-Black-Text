On Oct. 10, 2009; the Kum8e Go, located on the corner
ofsth and west, was demolished. Students, perhaps fac-
ulty, and community members alike were left with limited
options from which to procure their light night sluroees
or packs of chocolate doughnettes for the dark
winter months, including the entirety of Hell
Week and ﬁnals week.

After returning from Winter Break, howeVe
er, all can delight in the new, improved and fi-
nally open Kum 8c Co, which ofﬁcially opened
its doors to the Grinnell Community in mid-
January. But WTF is the difference between
the old and new Kum 8:. Go?

“In all honesty, it feels like you can't go in
there drunk," said John Burrows '10, Kum 8.:
Go aﬁcionado. "It’s a lot brighter and has more cameras."

“It looks too fancy. I feel out of place," said Kum 8e Go
frequenter Dylan Naylor '13. “I feel unwelcome. I’m not
classy enough."

This description of"c1assy" stems from the freshly tiled
linoleum tloors that grace the entire inside. along with'the
signiﬁcantly larger Kum 8e Go clothing-selection, possible
due to the increase in square feet of the actual space.

“They offer a wider Kum 8c Go apparel section, which
is nice," Burrows said. “I’m saving up to buy the His."

In addition to clothing, the beverage selection has been
vastly expanded, offering an array ofcoffee blends and ﬂa-
vors.The massive soda machine allows a customer not only

me 1' H to add ﬂavored syrups, such as cherry and ya

nilla, to a carbonated beverage,but also added a
mysterious dispenser marked “lean," which one
can only assume helps boost fat-burning while
sipping your oiroz mountain dew and chomp-
ing down on your loerat frozen burritos.

If frozen treats are yourjam, in addition to
burritos and burgers piled high in the freezers,
the new Kum 23c Go also comes complete with
a milkshake machine. Initial reviews of this
machine, however, are shaky at best.

“They don't taste like milkshakes," said Emily Evans
’13. “I strongly doubt there was any milk product"

Naylor agreed, They really could be more milky and
more shake y They were neither."

However, the new Kum 8eGo. despite its advancements
in milkshake technology, lacks the extensive selection of
hot dog accoutrements that the Kum N Go ofyore boasts
ed. Seriously, I Just want some jalapenos.
