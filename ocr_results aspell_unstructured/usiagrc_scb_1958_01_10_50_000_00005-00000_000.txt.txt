Pioneer Squad

Wrestle Oles
,ln Dual Meet

weekend Coach Bob

This
Peterson takes an eight-man
wrestling squad to North'field.,

Minn, for a dual meet against
St. Olaf college, the tirst this
season for the Pioneers. The
Oles, rated among the top four
in the Midwest conference, will
make this_a tough meet for the
Pioneers.

Thus for this season, the
squad has competed in two
quadrangular tournaments. At
the Knox invitational Dec. 7,
the Pioneers placed second he-
hind Coe, with Knox third and
Monmouth fourth. A week later,
at the Cornell Quadrangulzr, the
fast company of Purdue, Man-
kate State, and Cornell proved
too much for the squad forcing
it into last place, despite good
performances by Wilkerson and
Van Anrooy.

The squad competing on Sat-
urdey includes Jerry Cooke, 123.
1b,, Dodd Millar, 137-11). class;
Dwight Nissen, l47-lb. class;
Merritt McCall, 157—1b, class;
Roy Simpson, 1674b. class;
Dave Van Anrooy, m-lb. class;
and Bruce Wilkerson, heavy—

Weight.
St. Olaf college placed fifth
last year in the Conference

meet immediately behind Grim
nell. This year, however, three
outstanding matrnen, Buddy
Kai-k, 157-lb., Jim Peterson,
heavyweight, and Thronson, 191—
lb., will threaten a Grinnell
squad depleted by graduation.
Thronson, who may wrestle in
either of the two heavy classes,
was first in the conference meet
last year in the lei-lb. class.

Coach Peterson, ”This
will be one of the squad’s
toughest meets, as St, Olaf is
a definite competitor for top
conference honors this year.”

Hit 2i Per Cent
In 62-52 Defeat
By Iowa Teachers

The Pioneers required al-
most four minutes to find
the basket: against: Iowa
Teachers Wednesday night
and never found the range
as they lost to the Panthers
62-52 in a non-conference
affair in Darby gym.

Gl‘innell's field goal shooting
percentage was 27%. The Pio-
neel's never led although they
trailed by only one point early
in the game and by 15 points
during the second half.

The Pioneers’ scoring was led
by George Mchmsey and John
Copeland with 15 and 14 points
respectively. ‘

In action over the holidays
the Pioneers split in two
games. Grinnell participated in
the Knox invitational holiday
series which included Sour
team playing in two double-
headers. Two Ohio colleges.
Denison university and Ken-
yon college, joiner! Grinnell
and Knox for these games.

The Pioneers played Denison

in the first game and lost 66—61
in overtime. The game featured
a spectacular desperation field
goal by Denison which knotted
the score and forced the game
into overtime. With a minute
and a half remaining in the
regulaion game the score was
tied 53-53.

The Pioneers controlled the
ban until, with only seven seo-
onds left, Denny Collis scored
on a. jump shot to give Grin-
nell a two-point edge. Deni-
son brought the ball up court‘

quickly and fired. a last ditch
attempt from 15 feet which
spun through the hoop to tie

paced the Pioneers with 16
pains. Bob Mchmsey’s 15-

Opponents Carry
Same Records As
Grinnell B-Ballers

Chlcago University will be
Grinnell’s next basketball foe
here tomorrow night. Tuesday
the Pioneers will host St. Olaf
in a conference game.

Chicago and Grinneu have
played one comn opponent,
Ripou, and both won handily.
st. Olaf and Grinnell have
both beaten Lawrence and lost
to Knox and Monmouth.

The Oles are playing under a
new coach this year, Bob Gelle,
captain of the 1953 University
of Minnesota basketball team.
They have a well rounded team
headed lby Warren Peterson
6-1 guard, Dick steinbach, 5-7
center and Pete Nestande, 6-4
guard. Only a sophomore, Nes-
tande is among the leadexs in
conference scoring this season.

”Our two biggest probluus,"
states Coach Pmsch, "are our
poor shot percentage and high
number of fouls." The Pioneers
have had more field goals than
the opposition in some of their
losing tilts but have'lost the

' games at the foul ‘line.

Relying on the best rebound-
ing he has had in recent years,
Coach Pfitsch will probably
start Bob and George Mchm-
sey, George Susens, John Cope-
land, and Denny Collis.
