Bir'H'i Notice

Now that the campus has been gripped
for 2t time in the hands of a rough, tough,
freshman class, and upperclassmen have
been frightened into proper respect for
prep power, it might be wise to review the
activities of the past week with an eye to
calculating the effects they have had on
Grinnell spirit and Grinnell‘s reputation.
Let’s start with Tuesday night.

After the nerverwracking shock
wrought by the disappearance of various
hall trophies and fixtures, it was only nat-
ural that men on North campus should be
jumpy and unpredictable. The fact that
such inter-ball pranks have been part of
Grinnell activity for some years, is no rear
son to stop us guys from getting jumpy,
by golly, if we want to. Besides, Spring
Day was due to be announced.

Then, on Thesday evening, the wittiest
group of men on campus presented the
third of a series of broadcasts from Cowles
roof, skillfully calculated to keep most of
the county awake, and by word, inflection,
and innuendo, to slander a few well-known
campus figures. The fact that these men
are too important and busy to devote their
script-writing talents and sweet voices to

the benefit of legitimate Grinnell radio
publicity, should make students all the more
grateful for the brief moment of happi-
ness these broadcasts give. The lid has efA
fectively been dropped, we feel, on wild-
cat radio endeavors, but Tuesday’s effort
touched off the explosi l

The rest of Tuesday evening was hec-
tic l . . ask any Gates man. The one good
thing to come of the freshman uprising in
that hall is the fact that more‘interest in
Gates hall was shown then by the fresh,
than at any previous time this year.

How Wednesday could dawn bright and
cheerful and full of hope, few upperclass»
men knew. But dawn it did, and Spring
Day was declared almost automatically. It
was a Spring Day that surpassed all ex-
pectations. To a Central Committee who
laid the intricate plans and ran the sche-
dule without a hitch; to a student who
made a pleasant task of cleaning 'up the
campus; to the faculty who ate pies, tossed
eggs, served box lunches, and dismissed
classes at the first sound of the bell, we
give thanks. May this Spring Day serve
as a goal for future Spring Days#of work,
play, and sunshine.

Forays in Gates were sporadic on Wed-
nesday night, with just a few of the upper—
classmen flipped into the Merrill park mud-
holel Smith hall‘s Switch Day began the
activities on Thursday, and by nightfall
the notion of freshmen giving orders to
upperclassmen was rampant among
the freshmen. Small mob scenes ushered

in the first pangs of hall initiations.

Is it possible to draw from this hodge-
podge of events a single conclusion? Let’s
see: the inter-hall souvenir hunting has de—
veloped almost into vandalism; the broad-
casts which might have done something
constructively good for the college, have
degenerated into a vulgar absurdity; and
what might have been the beginning of
good healthy intramural spirit turned into
a near mob scene, which may have spelled
the end of decent prepping at Grinnell.
The one thing which can be salvaged from
this mess is the thing which reared its
head for the first time this week a
birth, if you will, in preps and upperclass-
men as well, of some kind of unity. Be it
hall, or class, or Grinnell spirit, let’s keep
some of it . let’s keep the kind that
makes for good Spring Days.
