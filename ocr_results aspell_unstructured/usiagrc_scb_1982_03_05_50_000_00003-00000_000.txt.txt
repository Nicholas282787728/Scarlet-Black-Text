Grinnellians tojoin
Des MOines protest

by Laura Carter

Tomorrow at 12:30 pm. at least 50 Grins
nell students will leave from the Forum
parking lot and travel in two buses to Des
Moines to take part in “Iowa Solidarity
Day” at the sum: capitol. Joining the Grin»
nellians in Des Moines wil be up to 2,500
members oi organizations representing
the interests of farm, labor, church, lowV
income, senior citizens, consumer and stun
dent groups.

The purpose oi the rally is two-fold, aCA
cording to Skip Laitner, director oi
Research and Development for the Ames-
based Community Action Research Group:
The direct objective is to make legislators
aware of citizen concern over probable
cuts in human service programs, especial
1y as caused by the effects oi oil company
price increases in the past five years. The
second objective is “to establish solidarity
with ourselves, since we have the same
economic problems," Laitner said,

Laitner’s group is working with the lowa
chapter or the Citizen Labor Energy Coali~
tion, which represents 250,000 members oi
70 organizations, in coordinating Solidarir
ty Day.

The Grinnell contingent is directed by
Anne Bordonaro, who was originally in»
terested in staging a rally to protest finan-
cial aid cuts in conjunction with the March
1 National student Lobby Day held in
Washington, D.C. After contacting the stu
dent government oiiicers at lowa suite
University about her idea, Bordonaro
learned oi the March is statewide rally,
then pased the information on to student
leaders at the University of Iowa.

Laitner said a group from the University
of Northern Iowa will also attend the
demonstration. Aluiough Bordonaro cone
tacted several other small private colleges
in the state including Coe and Cornell,
students there were not interested in
Saturday’s gathering.

The Grinnell sojourn is financed through
the Political Activities Support Fund. This
money will be used to cover publicity
costs, the rental of' two buses and the
wages of the bus drivers. PASF Chairman
Jim Goodfellow expects the total cost to
run about $175,

The rally will consist oi speeches by

politicians, labor activists and concerned
citizens. Among the politicians speaking
are Tom Harkin, Iowa's Fifth District cone
gressman, Roxanne Conlin, former US.
District Court judge and present
Democratic candidate for Iowa governor,
and Ed Campbell, another Democratic
gubernatorial hopeiul and iormer lowa
Democratic Party chair. Sylvia Woods, a
powerful figure in Southern union organiz»
ing in the 19305 and 19405 who is now based
in Chicago, is also scheduled to speak.

The speakers are expected to address
the concern over program cuts and the ef
iect oi oi] compnay price increases in
Iowa, “Because oi excess oil company
prices, the state’s economy lwasi ilatten-
ed by $1 billion over the past iive years,"
Laitner said ,

According to an analysis by the Com
munity Action Research Group the price oi
oil in a competitive market would have
risen by 70 percent over the period of
1976-1931. Because the oil market is not
competitive, however, the increase
amounted to 113 percent, This percentage
difference resulted in a $7 million loss for
the state.

The $1 billion figure cited by Laitner
represents the total cost of the percentage
difference, the loss of 10,000 jobs and the
taxes dodged by oil companies through

loopholes. The 10,000 unemployed are not _

able to contribute to state tax revenues or
purchase lowa products and companies
make use oi such loopholes as claiming oil
drilling as an expense. Even though there
is little oil drilling in Iowa, this activity is
claimed as an expense, which reduced the
amount oi proiit subject to taxation.
Getting the various groups together will

. accomplish the second objective of

solidarity among them. “We'll make sort
of a stink," said Bordonaro, “We're going
to show. first of all. that we're incensed
about this one issue." Laitner added, “I
think we’re going to make an impact."

when asked why the demonstration is
being held on Saturday, when the
legislature does not meet, Laitner said.
“Legislators are going to get the message
it there are enough [people] there.”
