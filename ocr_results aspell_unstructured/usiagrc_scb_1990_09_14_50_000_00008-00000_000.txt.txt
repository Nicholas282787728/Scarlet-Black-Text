 

Alfred Hitchcock's
Birds T errorize Small
Town America

By Brett Fechheimer

AlfredHitchcock'sTheBirdsi
an eccentric and hon-iflc filmg
proved to be one of his most popli-
lar and enduring works. In the
1963 movie, hundreds ofbirds vt-
ciously attack the unsuspecting
residents of a small town on the
coastofNothemCalifomia. Also,
in a larger context, The Birds ex-
aminesthefragilityofourenvironv
mentand the chaotic and irrational
undercurrents of life—undercur-
rents which are often much closer
tothesurfacethanwewouldlikeor
realize.

Notwithstanding the birds
themselves, the movie has three
main characters: Rod Taylor as
Mitch Brenner, a cocky and ma-
nipulative young lawyer; Jessica
Tandy (Driving Miss Daisy) as
Lydia Brenner. Mitch‘s overpro-
tective, jealous mother and owner
of the home wherein much of the
movie takes place; and Tippi
Hedren as Melanie Daniels. a
vacuous socialite enamored of
Mitch and the victim of one of the

birds' first swooping attacks.

These three characters, along
with the restof the town fallprey
to the rapidly accelerated attacks
by the Seagulls, crows and sparr
rows who often peck and sweep
down en masse. In fact, these
birds sometimesprey upon some
of the town’s more innocent or
honest residents. For example,
tttey savagely attack young chili
dren within the supposedly safe
confines of both a birthday patty
and a schoolyard. By showing
these random and horrendous as»
saulls, Hitchcock reminds the
viewer of how tenuous one’s eve-
ryday world can be, and how
swiftly terror and upheaval can
sLt'lkeevenin themostunexpecled
of places.

The Birds, although free of
excessive blood and gore,
isnonethelessatruehorrormovie.
It is not for the faint of heart.
Hitchcock himself probably put it
best when he remarked: “The
Bird: could be the most terrifying
motion picture I have ever made."

Allen's Crimes

By Danelle Baker

“Unfortunately. great depth and
smolderingsensualitydon'talways
win," muses Woody Allen as the
love-struckidealistClitf in his ﬁlm
of shadows and ight, Crimes and
Misdemeanors

Though lacking the gun shots
andfleshscenesofprototypicalbox-
ofﬁcesmashes, Crimes is a ripe film
of both depth and sensuality, with
both tragic and comedic faces

The chief traumas are focused
on Judah Rosenthal (Martin I‘anr
dau), a prominent opthamologist.
When he attempts to terminate his
relationship with Delores (Anjelica
Huston), a striking hysteric and
Rosenthal's lover of two years, her
anger reaches feverish heights.
The only solution, it seems, is to
“go on to the next step," Rosenthal
is steely, nearly stoic to the cries
of Delores, yet plunges to the
depths of his Judaic faith after her
murden

‘The eyes of God are on us al-
ways,“ he claims, and the close
scnrtiny of God scatters forth a se~
ries of questions.

Cliff, a struggling documentary

maker with a dwindling marriage,
adds the Comedic factor. His dis»
like of his brother-in-law Lester, a
sexist, high»powered television
producer, played ironicallybyAlan
Alda,manifestsitselfin the ﬁlming
of Lester’s career. Cliff’s endear-
ing love quest for I-Iallie (Mia Far-
row). and the attempted exposure
of Lester’s pomposity on film,
structure the hemisphere of com-
edy and hedge only slightly upon
the remaining subplot.

Airaditional Allen ﬁlm, Crimes
and Misdemeanor: is a deft explo-
ration iu style. Scenes slide into
place on passing threads of jazz,
and brief cuttings of classic film
minor subtle plot peaks. A pecu-
liarweb ofGreek dramasurfaces in
the wise rabbi's complete loss of
his eyesight. Rosenthal can’t fully
see the repercussions of his ac-
tions, and the corpse of Delores is
found wide-eyed, The allusions to
the Oedipus tradgcdy and the hay-
wire cynicism of Woody Allen are
acun'ous mix, yet they merge, dab-
bling in the dark underside of sexu-
ality, the blinding strain and pleas
ure of relationships, and theblessed
light of humor.

CITIZEN KANE-un-

Brctt Fechhcirnter

Orson Welles‘ directorial debut. Citizen Karla, is a stylistic landmark. Many critics gushingly land it as the best
film evermadc. Itis perhaps the quintessential trim on the media‘s manipulationofsocicty. Its similarities to the life
of newspaper magnate William Rtndolph Hearst mulre it a valid and poignant criticism of the media's inherent
weaknesses, Throughout the film Welles portrays the American public as a victim of demagoguzry. The press is
portrayed not only as a manufacturer or public opinion but as a root easily used {or devious ends, Appropriately,
Citizen Kane is part of the "Power. Politics and the Media" program sponsored by the Roscnfield Committee.

Eclectic Wild at Heart Soundtrack
Offers Strange Mix of Musical Styles

By Jennifer Mattes

David Lynch's latest film, Wild
at Heart, is a surreal road picture
rent with dementia and lurid,
graphic violence, Its accompany—
ing Soundtrack is a Iiitingly bizarre
mix of punk, ‘50‘s rock and roll,
classical music and jazz. These
unrelated musical styles arejuxta-
posed to form an eerie and somehow
coherent whole. Lynch surely se
lected his music, some of which he
wrote himself, because it matches
the quirky tone of his cinematic
imagery so wellr

The album opens wiut the inex—
plicable strains of ordered German
classical music, composed by
Richard Strauss. This nearly le-
thargic piece is jarringly followed
by the pounding speed thrash of
Powcmtad. Its tune, “Slaughter-
house,” is distinguished by its re-
peating refrain offour slashing guir
tar chords, which sound as if they
belong in the middle of some
imaginary punk horror film.

The record is peppered with
classic nuggets of ‘50’s rock and

roll. “Baby Please Don‘t Go,“ as
performed by Them, evokes the
smokey blues guitar of the Delta.
“Don’t go down to New Or»
lean the song intones appro»
prialely during the film, as Cage
and Laura Dem blithely speed
down a black tar highway toward
the evil lurking for them in the
bottomlandsoftheSouth. Thetaut
sexual energy of Gene Vincent’s
version of “Be-Bop a Lula" re
ceives a sparkling CD reproduc»
tion as welli The song bursts twice
into a Classic ‘50’s guitar solo ac-
companied by a wild, screaming
saxophone.

More memorable, though, are
the dark, jazzy mood pieces, They
lurk at various stages of the sound
track and are evocative pieces that
draw the listener into a weird,
Lynchian state of feeling. They
are not unlike the eerie songs from
the director's TV series Twin
Peaks “Cool Cat Walk," for ex-
ample, sounds like its title, Jazz
strings accompanied by piano cre4

gliding down a series of twisting

The lyrics “You should have shot

somber bass line and a slow beat,
“Up in Flames" spirals musically
downward into a pit ofmelancholy,
