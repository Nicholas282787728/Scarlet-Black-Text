Social politics to blame for 80
percent retention rate, unhappiness

By RIVA SHARPLES
Editor in Chief

’S a topic frequently discussed among circles of upperelassmen at Grinnell.
Enthehallways ofARH, iniheloungechairs at meFomm Grill and atorowded

bles on Wednesday nights at State Street Station, the question often seems
to be. Are Gnnnellians really happy? —Ordoes this school somehow, over the
course of four years, turn seemingly confident individuals into confused, misep
ablepeople who are lessready to face theworldupon completion ortheireducation
than when they hisi came here?

Does Grinnell really make studenls unhappy? It appears so, at least to some
degee. Evenityou don’lwanttodispelthemyth tltathnnellis”theideal college"
and face the fact mat life here is not always as “wonderful" as our New Student
propaganda and old yearbooks would have us believe, reality, however harsh,
speaks for itself. Only 80pctcetn ofstuderirs who start at Grimiell acizially make
II to graduation. That ﬁgure is partleularily startling when compared to other
liberal artsschoois, including Grinnell’sbiggesteompetitors like Oberlin and Coe,
who report graduation rates of between 90 and 98 percent. The adrninstration is
even consented about the problem.

Last fall. in anS& 8 interview about this year's ranking ofI7thin the annual

 

US, News & Worm Report college sur-
vey, President Pam Ferguson said that

 

 

“the one way (Grinnell) could be stron-
ger is to raise our graduation rate.”
Ferguson acknowledged that Grinnell
students are “highly intelligent" andthat
when studentsleaveGrinnell, they don’t
quit school altogether. but usually go on
to graduate elsewhere

“(The Administmuon) will be my
vestigztting the Gnnnell dropout rate
more Closely in the hitiirc," Ferguson
told me last September. In the meantime, while they search their databases for
infomtation as to why Students are leaving unhappy, we as students should 5m
listening to one another and asking forchanges ifweareunhappy, lfwearereally
as miserable as we say, let’s do something about it

But what is it that's making us so miserable? Like at any institution, we
complain about the adminisimtton, about Student Affairs and about injustices in
thecollege judiciary system. We complain about room draw and professors who
assign too much work. We complain because the lines are too long at Quad and
Cowles. We complain that we are isolated by the social politics ofGrinnell.

Clearly many ofthese problems are hard to solve. Butone ortheeasiest ways
we can start feeling better andbehappier ath-innell is to stop socially dividing up
ourcarnpus. How can aschool the sizeofGi-innell havcsomany divisions? Why
do we letsocial politics tum individuals into stereotyped groups? smdenisoicoior
reel segregated from the rest of the campus because ortiieir color. Computer
expertsarepigeonholed intoBack Table stereotypes. lt'sthel-Iarris Crowd versus
those that frequent Gardner, It’s the “Joe " against the “p0theads.” To some
extent the Nonh-Souﬂtcampusdivision ismore hamiful today than itwas 30years
ago when it was actually designed and [ti/ended to keep one segment of the
Grinnell population away from another.

Ofcotuse. people are always going to hang out in certain groups, We can‘t
be inends with everyone, and admittedly, we don’t want to be. And, as my friend
Trish pointed out to me, what makes a lot of Grinneltians truly miserableand
unhappy is seeing tlicsamepeople over and overevery day. Ifthat'sthccase, why
are we acting diis way. pigeonholrng everyone into groups as if Grinnell were a
school or lzeoo iather than 1,200. My tricnd Dave told me that he often says hi
to people inpassing,cven prolessorssoittetlmes,and lheydon'talwayssay“hcllo”
haektoluitt, which he ﬁnds very upsetting. Thatshouldn’t happen anywhere. but
especially not at a small school like Gn'nnell.

Undoubtedly, there arcalotolieasolts forunhappiness athnnell and many
I‘ actors behind our 80 percent retention mte. It's overwhelming to try to solve all
the problems, but we can (and should) transform bar talk into sortie form of action.
rm sick oihearing complaints bl never seeing aiiythiiig happen as ifthe campus
IS dead. Ifthings are really so awful here at Grinnell. let's change them. Tell the
titlminstmuori how you feel and demand changes. Talk to Ferguson and Student
Aﬁari-s Send a letter to the editor if you disagree with something you see or read
Be vocal.

Most importantly, let‘s stop segregating individuals into categories. Then
we'll all be happier,
