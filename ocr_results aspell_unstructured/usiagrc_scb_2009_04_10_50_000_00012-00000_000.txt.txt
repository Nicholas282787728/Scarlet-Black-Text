Severe weather awareness? How' about zombie awareness?

I had newer seen a zombie movie before coir
lcge. Then I met Steph Cox ’09 and l was intro
duced [O a frightening new concept; the come
biepocalypse. “Night of the Living Dead,"“Bog
Creatures," and “Dead and Breakfast" (paired
with serious conversations about our relative abil—
ity to survive a zombie attack) fueled my imagis
nation. Grinnell is in the middle of the comﬁelds
ofiowa. Do ivc really have a chance?

I sought out these troubling conversations
with Steph and fellow zombie/apocalypse enthu-
siast Met Nechitilo '09; their zombie knowledge
and experience easily trumps mine. Now, I pen»
der the general defensive capabilities of various
academic buildings far more than the appliear
tion of literary theory
I’m an English major.
some key thoughts:

1. We have to real-
ize that the zombiepocs
alypse is unpredictable.

You can only make
basic plans and preparations, The real key to sur
vival rests on improvisation.

2. only a few buildings on campus can prop-
erly serve as a defensive stronghold against any
sort ofinvasion, especially from zombies:

Stuck on the third ﬂoor of ARH? Kiss your
brain goodbye before the zombie consumes it.

The JRC> It's ridiculously Vulnerable. No
matter how much that window in the dining hall
costs, it cannot withstand the pure strength of
determined zombies. Obiiously, Cesar Pelli had
ulterior motives.

It’s still a valuable resource, though. You
can run through the Marketplace, pick up the
rounded knives from the pizza station to use as
a Bat'leth or a bladed boomerang. Just hope the
Cheery Checkers haven't already been zombificd.
They won’t let you leave.

Noyce is deceptive. True, the glut ofmazevlike
hallways can allow yott to lose a confused zomble/
Humanities major without much difﬁculty But
zombies could mount a surprise attack from any
where. You could sustain a successful defense in
the greenhouse by barricading rhc stairwells, but
you can still get to the third ﬂoor through the Sci—
ence Library Again, through the windows.

Noyce might prove effective 25 a weapons
barracks thanks to the abundance of chemicals.
Various caustic acids could delay the zombie one
slaugln, but other chemicals could cause muta
tions, making the situation far worse.

As for the best places to avoid imminent
zombie attacks‘ Goodnow stands as the con—
sensus leader (sample size: 3), followed by mud.
Goodnow has only one entrance and though it
has vents to the basement, the vents are metal and
dihicult to remove, even for a human with regu—
lar motor control and a brain. Besides, there's a
tower. Towers are great. If towers weren’t great,
castles wouldn't have them. Goodnow is also
wellretockcd with primitive weaponry: atlatls

and axes, among other
things,

(hind can be barri-
caded, since no zombie
could climb through the
windows, but youd ultr
mately get overwhelmed

There’s just too much open space. And now that
it no longer serves as a dining hall, you get no
food and no weapons.

But where do mu go from all this theoriz~
ing.> After several hours ofdiscussions and many
sourcesl have a basic plan, And you should trust
me, since the intemet says I have a 70 percent
chance ofsurvin'ng. Assumingl hear the news in
my Haincs second room, I would make my way
to the JRC for the aforementioned giant kmves
and food supplies, assembling a crack team of
zombie killers on the my. Next, we’d cut though
Noyce in the most direct way possible, and then
make our way carefully to Goodnow, keeping the
pizza knives ready to slice off a zombie head. The
key here is to avoid sneak attacks but not to be so
out in the open that you are easily surrounded.

once safely inside, we'd barricade the single
entrance to Goodnow and ensure that it is actu—
ally the only entrance. We’d arm ourselves with
minds and axes and wait for the hordes. But lead
ing an inexperienced and small force against a
zombie invasion is not smart. You have to wait
foryour heroic final stand, killing zombies as they
break through your defenses and pile through the
door, blocking their own path. Godspeed.

Go deep into McIntyre’s mind

BYNEILFINNECAN

This weekend’s concerts promise a wide
range of musical genres crammed into just
two shows. Before Sebastien Tellier presents
his library ofsongs, Eric J. McIntyre, Music,
will present “Music from the Mind of Eric
J. h’lclntyre" at 7:30 pm. in Sebring-Lewis
Hall, featuring four ofhis compositions per-
formed by various students and faculty.

“In six years of being here at Grinnell,
I have not done any composition recitals,"
McIntyre said. “Since rhar's . , . my primary
area of scholarly work, it’s dawned on me
that probably it would be a good idea."

The concert features four starkly differ-
ent compositions composed by McIntyre
throughout his career. The first, “Ball Sax
on Bourbon;V features two horns and a baris
tone and shows oitMcInryre's talents in jazz
composition. “Some very Speciﬁc Views,"
the second piece, is a digital tape composi-
tion. “[The song is] completely edited from
human voices I recorded coming into the
studio," McIntyre said, which he assembled
into a sonata piece.

These two pieces set up "Lament," the
cornerstone of the performance, which is
based on McIntyte’s understanding otthe
word to be Ka scream of grief."

“it's not a particularly beautiful piece of
music,” McIntyre said. “It uses some “on,
traditional notation, boxed gestures that
people will play in random orders, and flex-
ible timings."

Playing “Lament,” musicians will have
to decide on their own exactly what to play.
“We're not actually reading off a normal
score," said ﬂautist Emma Jcrndal '09. “It’s

just a line of notes and , , . each player can
just decide which line they play in this win-
(low of time . _ it’s never the same twice.”

“I really\ s driven to program ‘Lament’
was because it's rare to get a critical mass of
students who not only have the musical far
cility to and the ﬂexibility to play a piece like
this that's not traditionally norated, but also
have the virtuosity," McIntyre said.

McIntyre intends the final piece, the
snakesp inspired ". . .full of sound and
fury, Sig rig nothing," to remain some
what of a mystery. “It’s for piano, inﬁnite
handsi and a Shakespearean actor,"McIntyi'e
said, revealing little else.

A number of student performers took
McIntyre’s Weird Music tutorial three years
ago, and McIntyre’s compositions are often
drawn from class material. ‘

“My guitar part is inspired by Jandek,
who we studied in tutorial," said Ryan Kart-
heistr ’09. “so my experience is coming full
circle."

“Music from the Mind of Eric ]. Mc-
Intyte” promises to be varied, engaging, and
at times surprising, all of it displaying the
diverse talents of Grinnellians. The first
piece is traditional, the second anything but,
the third unpredictable, and even McIntyre
doesn’t quite know how the ﬁnal one will
unfold.

But the pieces might be coming together
just in time. “Yesterday, we were in rehearsal
and I think we were ﬁnally doing what Eric
wanted,"]erndal said. “I noticed he was con-
ducting and he started ro cringe . . . usually
this is a bad thing but I think that was what
he vwmted."

Sébastien Tellier brings the love

Surrender t0 Frenchman/s distinctive and sensuous music

We all know the French aren’t like us.
Whether in politics, food, philosophy, oi
a languoious joic de vivre that the typical
rushetl American can’t comprehend, they
seem to understand how to live.

tronic music and infuses it with a dreamy
organic feeling.

His music is both so distinctive and so
listenable that it doesn’t fit in anywhere.
“Divine" was nominated for the Eurovisron
awards, a source of much controversy in
France since the song features little French
(unlike much of Tcllier's other work, espe-
cially his early two albums, “L’lncroyable
Vetite' (The Incredible Truth) and “Polis
tics”).

Tellier converted some of the lyrics to
French to sing on the show, and the eventu—
al performance featured five backup singers

rhnr hc always wears.

With these elements to his music and
pcitormance, Tellier wouldn’t be a likely
pick for a “typical” French crooner. if one
even ekists. Classifying him as a crooner
becomes even more difficult when one
Guernnuel dc HomernsChristo (one half
ofDaft Punk), the producer and sometimes
beat-maker for “Sexuality”, comes into the
picture. Though Tellier’s voice by itself will
probably never storm the dorm lounges likc
Daft Punk, the combination ofhis voice and
Christo’s beats
could be filling
the dorm bed
rooms soon.

In an inter
rupted inter-
view, Tellier said
that the current
tour “was really short", but was going “res
ally great." He thought that the continual
references in interviews to Daft Punk were
“a good way to follow me, to get publicity."
He also maintained that any concert space
would work for him (though he hasn’t seen
l-larris yet). “The venue doesn’t matter,” he
said.

What matters to Tellier is the perfor
mance, what ‘he described as “the lights in
my face." With the help ofBrooklyn dance
punkers Lemonade, whom the BBC de-
scribed as “pure, agile, hedonistic pop mu-
sic,” it should be an evening that helps us
realize why we love the French. And their
“sexuality."
