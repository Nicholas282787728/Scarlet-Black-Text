In Such Times As These—--

The S1; ﬂat land 31' k for Oct. 24, 1917, twenty five years
ago tomorrow, car ed a brief announcement of the cancell—
ation of all special homecoming activities for that year, due
to the war situation.

Well, here we are, at homecoming, Oct. 24, 1942, and
again at war. We haven’t cancelled our celebration. Now,
on the eve of tlle event, we are wondering about the justl-
ficatioii for this action, Perhaps we just didn‘t think about
the wisdom of such a celebration before this time. We who
are now students have always had a homecoming. Wc’ye
taken it for granted; perhaps our' own assurance protected
the day. Bllt such reasoning would suggest that we here
in Grinnell in a ,‘ear or" war are not male of the situation
outside our own community. That is not true.

Every one of us has thought of the possib ity of can-
celling homecoming. We thought of it with a sense of per
sonal disappointment, of longing to see some of the people
we knew last year, of peevishness at the chance of missing
a game or a dance or a bull session.

But we’ve thought too of a justification for homecom-
ing that is more than rationalization. _

Naturally we want you alumni to be here this year
for a little while just to be Grinnellians again. We like
the idea of your singing with us “Come Ye Back to Old
Grinnell.”

Yet we aren’t asking you to come back this year so
that we can forget reality for a while. We’re asking yoll
to come so that together we can remember the old reality
and know that it is worth this temporary displacement.

Secondly, we want you to come back to see exactly
what goes on here this year. We want you to walk around
campus and see the changes, look at the army and the re-
arranging we’ve done to accomodate them, ask yourself if
that thing we tritely called ‘Grinnell spirit‘ has changed
for the worse or the better.

For the thing different about Grinnell’s homecoming in
this war year of 1942 is that for the first time we can re-
member, alumni are coming back, not to reassure students
about the school or the future or “life” beyond college; but
to be reassured by us that we are not letting war changes
get us down, to be reassured that the school is going on,
that the Standards have not changed.

Yet we underclassmen do not take responsibility for
this homecoming. It is really your celebration, the
return of persons who have been away. We still need your
help, as we always have, to keep united that larger Grin-
nell which you represent, the community of all people, who
have been connected with this college. We still need your
thoughts and feelings for this college during changing per-
iods ahead which may be more difficult than the physical
changes of the last three months. _ ‘

And so, though we reassure you of ollr own faith in
and hope for Grinnell, we ask the same faith and hope from
. on.
y This is, in many ways, a bittersweet occasion. Some
of you will not be back next year, or the next. To you who
may not return for a while, we, the underclassmen, promise
that as long as we are here we shall try to keep this school for
you as you Grinnellians have always wanted it. ‘

We’re glad there is a homecoming in this war year of
1942. We’re glad you came home.

OCTOBER 23, I942

Alumni In Grinnell is Wartime Plans

A great sonial institution, such as
Gi'innell College is, has a past
which we ans lncllned to ldeallzc,
a present which we frequently
vicw with alarm. and a futiiic
which we all too often take for
granted. Gi'lnilell's distinguished
and productive past has been
iccognlzcd and appreciated not
only by alumni, but by socially
minded men and women who her
licvc in liberal cducation.

While the fundamental purpose
and spirit of a college remains
the same, the instrumentalities
by means o[ which it is realized
must continuously undergo ads
jiistmenf. Herein lies the source
of conﬂict and misunderstanding
which so heqiiciitly arises in De-
gﬁi'd to any institution.

Alumni are illclillcd at
times to \iew with alarm the
processes of change which ac-
tually keep the college in
tune with the times. Tradic
tions once so dearly held,
frequently become outworli
alid outmoded. New practic-
cs, experimental and tenta—
tive when first tried, soon
take on the character of tra—
ditiolis ill immediately suc-
ceeding college generations.
If Grinllell did not change, at
least superficially, while the
rest of the world was under-
going extensive social, econ,
omic, and political revolu-
tions, it would soon cease to
function significantly as a
social institution.

At the present time the Col-
lege is attempting to adjust it»
self to the realities of total war.
The quiet, easy-going academic
life has changed. The pace of
educational activity is accelcrat-
ed. The curriculum is being re-
examined to determine its f -
ncss for education in wartime.

Instead of quietly projecting
ten or twenty-year programs of
development and institutional en-
richment, we are striving des-
pel'ately to keep one day ahead
of the demands which are being
forced upon us. iLiving from day
to day in a period of crisis such
as this puts a. terrific strain on
the institution Continuity of ef~
fort is difficult to msintain, The
multitude of Specml projects fre-
quently imperil the larger instn
tunoiial objectives which, like a
silver col-d, have held our life to»
gather through our long past. Ev-
ei‘y responsible instructor and ads
ministl-ator in the college is faced
each day with new problems for
which past prccedcncc supply
little guidance.

In order this: we may he sure
to preserve ale integrity of the
College in the midst of such
cliiuigc, it is required of nil of us
that we experience :i new fellow-
ship of,iiniici-stimdiiig and draw
upon new sources of devotion to
common Links.

Educational institutions, such as
Gi-iniicll, are in peril.

The ciugencics of war time and
the immediate necessities of
technological training for victory
bend to put into the background,
if not to obscure altogctlic, the
enduring values of lihci-al educa-
tion. The hysteria. of great pro-
pci-fians for immediate offensive
action has caused many leaders
in education and in government
to look upon liberal learning as
a peacetime luxury which a peer
pic with their backs to the wall
can no longer enjoy. This is, of
course, is mistaken nation. but

account.

Grinnell shares with other
thoughtful educational insti-
tutiolls the faith that ill war
and peace liberal learning is
at once the finest device for
the development of intellec-
tual discipline necessary for
victory, and, from a long
time point of View, it is the
essential type of lea 'ning up:
oil which sound social adjust-
ment can be made concerning
a post war world and a

lasting peace,
Most thoughtful people who

view the educational scene recog—
nize that some of our fin-est in-
stitutions are likely to be so
weakened during the war as to
be in jeopardy in the future.
Grinnell is no exception. Survival
as an institution is going to be
difficult, but it will not be im-
possible. while our future is not
guaranteed, there is much that
can be done to give us the as-
sui'ance of future educational usc»
fulness.

The productive effort of alumni
in Contributing to Victory will be
a quiet testimony to the value
of broad, liberal learning. Far
sighted political leaders recognize
that tile really hazardous war will

know that unless we bring up a
