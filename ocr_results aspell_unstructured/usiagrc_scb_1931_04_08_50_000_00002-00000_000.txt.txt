V THE. END OF AN EPOCH

\Vllell H. \V. Mallack of Gl‘illllell college ('l'C-
ated the Pioneer song almost 10 years ago it ill-
cludcd this stanza ’

Said “Pl y‘ )laill. I won’t disdain to

milkc the college grow.

But every man must plot and plan to help

me i isc the dough:

A lllillioll dollars for the scholars and tllc

faculty,

A million more, for laboratories and at

cclcry

President Main’s quarter century at Grinncll h
trllly been an epoch‘in which making the coll
grow was the central feature.

. It has been an epoch of growth for c erything
in Amcrica. Colleges, as well as businesses. have
had to grow to live. Near the beginning of this
period Leander Clark college, 30 miles north of
Gl'innell, stopped operation. This year Penn rol-
legc, 30 miles south, mortgaged its campus. They
, didn’t grow enough.

Thanks to President Main, Grillllell has grown
enough, It iS now as large as the best small or
plirzltc colleges ill the country. There are (lol'mle
tories, a recitation hall, and ii div Sc curriculum
which stand as monuments to the picsident’s rcste
less persistence. A long endowment campaign has
drawn to a close.

President Main expanded the college ill order
that it might serve its real purposes; to teach the
eternal ideals of tnltll ‘aud beauty ill the here and
now, He built a foundation on which these hopes
might be fulﬁlled

The year of President lllain’s death sees the
passing of the era of construction throughout
America, and Gril‘mcll is no exception, The realiza-
tion of the ideals for which the building was ac-
complished will he the truest memorial to John
Hanson Thomas Main and his era.

‘YELLOW’ JOURNALISM'S FINALE

If the succ s of a collcgc editor is judged by
the frequency with which his name appears on the
front pages of sensational metropolitan dailies.
then the term completed today by the managing
editor of The Grillllell Scarlet, and Black has been
a great failure. Comments in the college paper
upon the quadrangle iron fence and women’s smoke
iug rooms at Grinuell were “passes” to the outside
press a year ago, but throughout the 193031 term
“success” came in a mild form after editorial dis
cussions of the campus prohibition poll and all-
college “hull” session on “victory” day last fall.

Radical changes, ill the opinions of clcstrnctlvc
critics. have been made ill Tllc Scarlet and Black.
Breaking away from a conservative lllakcllp to a
liberal llliluagclllcl’lt of the editorial (lcpnrtulrut of

HG
PRESIDENT MAIN
(From the New York Times)

The March number of the alumni publication of
Grinnell college announced the last step in the creation
of a ﬁne arts department. Long ago President John
Hanson Thomas Main published his plan for such an
inclusive department, and he saw his hope fulﬁlled be-
fore death came to close his career of nearly 40 years
as professor and president in that sturdy institution of
New England prototype adapted to a prairie environ-

ment.
He was a Puritan in his austere morality, and he

respected the traditions of his institution, but he was a
Creek in his love of arts. He objected to smoking on
the campus, but led in the development even of the
drama. By what seems a curious paradox, the subjects
which were formerly considered improper for inclusion
in the curriculum, either because they did not comport
with the serious purposes of the college or because they
were too vocational in character, have now been called
upon ”to stem the tide of the vocational and practical
in college education."

President Main, who had had his graduate training
at Johns Hopkins university under Professor Cilcrsleeve
in Greek, maintained sound scholarship and moral vigor,
So characteristic of the small colleges of the middlewest,
and at the same time added something of the charm
and beauty that are offered by the arts which notably
ﬂourished in the civilization to which he gave special
study. His was a real contribution to the modern develop-
ment of the college of liberal arts.

President Main performed national and international
services. notably as a member of the Near East Relief
commission, but his monument will be what he has
made of Grinnell college, especially in the midst of un-
favoring economic conditions about him and in the face
of vocational trends, His ”silver anniversary" was ap—
proaching, and it was suggested only last month that
it would be most any celebrated by the erection of a
ﬁne arts quadrangle to provide a permanent home for
music, art, and the drama on the campus of the college.
It; should now be his memorial,
