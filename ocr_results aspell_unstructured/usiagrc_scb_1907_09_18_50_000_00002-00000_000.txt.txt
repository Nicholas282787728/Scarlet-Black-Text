FRESHMAN»SDPHOMORE SCRAP.

"The best scrap in years"was the
general opinion of the annual class
scrap which occurred in front of the
Men’s Gymnasium at an early hour
on Monday morning. In pointoi num-
bers the two classes were very evenly
matched While in past years the
Freshmen usually have had the major-
ity. The usual order of proceedings
was reversed this year by thelollmeu
taking the initiative and serving
notice on the Sophomores that a large
dummy draped in class colors to-
geLher with a number of 19m class
hats would be burned on the campus
Monday morning: Tile Freshmen
collected inrthe West part of town
and after dusk marched In a body Lo
the Men’s Gymnasium which they
occupied during the night. The
Soplis Logged in battle array, appear»
ed on the scene in the early morning
hours and plying the heavy stones
(mm the gym. steps laid them against
the double doors, thus having their

fees prisoners. But the rllmculry was
soonsolved an in a minute the big
window in ilie director’s ohice was
opened and the lllllers Jumped out in
a perrect torrent into the arms of
the awairing Sophs. For some time
the victory was doubtful but after an
hour and a hair of hard struggle the
Freshmen conquered. Having bound
the Sophs. hand and foot at 7 o‘clock
the Sophs. gave up the struggle and
the victorious Freshies gathered
around the ﬂag pole wherethe dummy
was burned with due ceremony.
