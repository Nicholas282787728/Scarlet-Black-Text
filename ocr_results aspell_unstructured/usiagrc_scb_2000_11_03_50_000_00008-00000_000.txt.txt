The Rest is History...

“I think that Americans underesti—

nature of this conflict," said Minna
Mahlah. the director of the science
learning center. As a people living in a
nation whose consciousness and docur
merited history extends back only
about 300 years, we face a challenge in
truly understanding the tremendous
importance and in.

noted. “Thousand

In trying to apt
preciatc the history
of the conflict,
Americans are at a
disadvantage sim.

conflicts in United states history. one
like various movements in America's
history. the political turmoil hetivccii
the Jews and Palestinians, while it may
have existed as dormant hostility, has

Azoulay ‘03. said.

thn we do try to compare the
situation in the Middle East to oiirown
experiences, it's important to evaluate
the accuracy of these comparisons.
Michael Roscnrhal argued that some
Americans inaccurately compare the
struggle otpnlostinians io the African»
