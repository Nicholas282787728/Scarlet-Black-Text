By Michael Kavanagh

The Rosenfield Program’s ex-
tensive symposium on civil rights
did not begin quiteas planned. The
scheduled speaker. Minister Kevin
Muhammad of the Muslim Broth-
erhood, was replaced at the last
tninuteby hisco-workeratMosque
No. 7’in Queens, New YorkJaahir
Muhammed. Zaahir, who was for
merly in the us. Marine Corps,
attended the John Jay College of
Criminal Jtntice and is now very
active in the Nation oflslam, tray»
eling the country and speaking on
various campuses.

Zaahir's speech, however, [014
lowed the scheduled topic of “The
Quest for Freedom, Justice and
Equality in America."

Beginning with an Arabic phrase
which means “peace be unto you,”
Liahir went on to say that African
Americans have never experienced
frecdom,justice orequaltty. Citing
the lives of many famous people,
suchasNatTumer,HarrietTubman,
Frederick Douglass and Sojourner

and
ORGANS,

Truth, Zaahir explained how the
black perspective Shapes the lives
of such people. And it is through

views freedom, justice and equal-
ity: something that is not his.

require the rigid law structure or a
place likc lran, which is to him a
white country.

He denied that the teaching of
Farrakhan advocates hate or black
supremacy but claimed to attempt
to prove Black Muslim Philosophy
with science, mathematics and re-
ligion,which involved rejecungthe
Biblical theory ofereation. Healso
spent a large portion of the lecture
arguingon anthropological grounds
thatblacks were theoriginal people
oneanhandthatwhitesweregmrted
from them.

Ziahir condemned homosexu-
ality as an “abomination" accord-
ing to the Koran and cited the bibr
licalstory ofSodom andGomorrah.
But later in his speech, he called
black men who have “bowed and
bent” to please whites by disgrac-
ing their women “fagotty-types."

when asked to clarify his use of
the term “fagotty»types" he stated:
“I don‘t mean any disrespect to
homosexuals. I just meant those
menwhoaresowomanlytheydon’t
stand up for themselves.”

Ambitious Texan
calls for change

By Sarah Purcell

tim Htghtower, theformerTexas
Agriculture Commissioner, spoke
on“Populistpoliticsinlhe1990's",
Monday in an event sponsored by
the Rosenﬁeld Program and PPPE.

Hightower's career has been
marked by his championing of
“populist" ugrieultuml and eco-
nomic development plans and his
attempts to rouse interest in grass
roots political organizing. The San
Francisco Chronicle said in 1988
that “Hightower has made a career
of fighting forlittle people's inter-
ests in a language that cuts across
conventionallyacceptedboundaries
of party, race and class.“ He lived
up to this reputation on Monday.

Hightower said that he was in
Grinnell to talk about ”plowing
common ground" at a time of an
American “crisis of democracy.”
He expressed concern that so few
Americans participate ll’LpOlillCS,
arid that govcmmcnl policies serve
only a fraction of Americans.

Hightowcr cited President
Bush‘srecentrevival of his capital
gainstaxcutproposalasanexample
of the effortin the 1980'sto “release
the creative powers oithewealthy”
while the vast majority of the
American public is ignored.

He maintained that the “80% of
AmericansWholostlncomeduring
the 1980's" didn’teven “getdamp”
trom me Reagan Administration‘s
policy of"t\'icklcdown."Usingthe
Savings 2md Loan scandal as the
latest example of how the govern-
ment is “feeding a paper economy
at the top” of society, Hightower
called foraradicalredistributionof
the wealth in America.

l-lightower advocated a new
politlcalinvolvementbylhe‘Workv
a-daypeopleofthiscountry"whom
hcthinks mustactagainstasystem
which has allowed junk bond king
Michael Milken to earn “fifteen
thousand times more than the
teacherof the year." He dubbed the
1988 presidential race as possibly
the “last kind of WASP confronta-

tion"becauseAmerican politicians
and institutions will now have to
learn “not to cope, but to embrace"
cultural and ethnic diversity
Hightowcr included reforms in
wages, work'ers’ benefits,child care,
schools, and the health care system
as examples ofpopuliSt issues with
which he feels Americans mustbe-
gin to challenge politicians.
During a lengthy question and
answer period, Hightower further
elaborated on the populist agenda
for the 1990’s. International rela-
tions would be governed by “rela-
tionships between peoples” as op-
posed to competitive “exploitation"
by multi-national corporations.
When challenged thatsuch poli-
cies might lead to companies leav-
ing America, Hightower did not
seem to worry saying largecompar
nies could not afford to leave the
United States. their "1051 lucrative
market, Referring to other areas of
international policy he said that“a
populist president wouldn't be in a
Persian Gulf war.“ But he was retir
cent about his own aspirations.
“I’m not here to run for Presi-
dent,but,ycs.il’sapossibilitydown
the road,” On the ideaof the forma-
tion of a third party for progressive
issues, Hightower said “i don't
know whetherthis is agood idea,or
not." He did not dismiss the Demo-
cratic party as a possible progres—
sive outlet if they could “nominate
a real democrat." Higlttower said:
“I think all things should be tried."
» Hightowerisnowhelpingtostart
what hecalls the “Financial Dc-
mocracyCampaign.”abroad-bascd
coalition ofeommunily and issues
oriented groups which have agreed
to focus on populist policies in the
Iowa Caucuses and other political
arenas. “We've got to quit being
bluffod by grccdrheads!" he said.
in a February when political
candidates are suangely absent from
Iowa,Hightower gave hisaudlence
a strongly worded description of a
progressivepoliiicalprograrnwhich
could become highly visible and
controversial in thc year to come.
