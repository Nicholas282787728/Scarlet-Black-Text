Affairs calls
for change in
alcohol policy

Bust was premeditated, say police

News Editor

The Grinncll Police Department's expulsion or all underage ccle
cbranrs from Saturday's annual Mary B. James dance will hetorne a
common occurrence, should alcoholtreluerl “complaints and contacts”
continue, said department omcers this week,

“lrwasnt n spur orthe moment thing," said the departrncnt's Cap.
rarn Tim sitrig. “We've had some complaints, especially rrom the
ambulance crews, about the numberof[2lcolloltp<)isonlng] complaints.
My printers were told that it they got to the college and there was
something out orconrrol, they rake whatever action was necessary,"

After discussions with police representatives and mcmbcrs ofAll-
Campus Events student security and Harris desk attendanu, student
Serviccs and Campus sccurity concludcd Wednesday that a change
was required in the college’s alcohol policy at Harris parties.

“I think that we need to move to a system ofdlstributron in which
the server puts the drink in the hands ora pcrson known to he 21,"
snidlmliifcr Ki'ohn, dean of rcsldciicc llfc. “We don't have any choice."

The college’s orricial alcohol policy forbids underage drinking, said
Krohn, “We have stepped back from that. We've also said that ifthe
policc come, its your doal." Efforts to tighten the college's policy at
Harris are intended to square the college‘s intervention before the fact
with the interventions it has become accustomed to talrrng after the
her, she explained,

“It may not decrease drinking, but it may help students ln defend
ing themselves that they're doing the right thing: not serving'peopl:
underage,“ said student Services vreeapruidentTom Crady orrhe pro.
posal ar Joint Board Wednesday.

More details on enforcement have yet to he hammered out by
ACE security, Harris staff, and college administrators. Crady. also said
that though he did not expect to reduce drinking overall on mmpus,
he would instigate an informational program to reduce the frequency
orbinge consumption.

Crady, Sittig, and Theresa Peterson, the sergeant who had been
called rn to supervise tho bust, all confirmed that police did not wish
to actively seek our undemgc drmkers. but that because they are legally
obligated to report any illegal activities they witness, if they are called
to Harris in any similar situation, they will enrorce Iowa's drinking
age.

“To get down to brass racks, ifyou'rc under 21, it's illegal to ton.
sum: or possess alcohol," said Sittig. “We don‘t always hnve the re»
sources to he everywhere at onto, so you might get away with drinking
six or seven times a semester, hut one time, you’re going to get in
trouble The ball is sort of in the students’ court right noun”

Art ic party, which was disbanded by ACE security members early
Sunday morning, several kegs oilseer had been served, but were ex-
hausted by the time police arrived in the wake oran ambulance call.
The student for whom the ambulance had been called was underage

Though Sittig said Monday that he

‘bclicved tho intoxicated student had gore
ten drunk at Harris, partyorgznlur Rick
Carley '03, said the student had never
been given beer by party starters.

Carley who has a court date in awcek
to examine his possible distribution or
alcohol to minors, is also under 21 but
had signed a Contact as the person re.
sponsrble for the night’s Harris center
activities. in pastycars, that position had
bcm ﬁlled by the Homes—James hall so-
cial coordinator, bur that student had
decided not to throw daisycar's party and
Corluy had volunteered.

Though Crady said he sympathired
with Corlryi‘l have some questions
about the citation myself,” he told in—
he said that the college would not rake
action to support the student in legal or
punitive ices.

Asked ifa community. rather than an individual, might be held
responsible for the violation ora law, Sittig said, "somebody’s respon—
sible for something that goes on, whether that's a student or a faculty
member or whatever the as: may be."

Sittig previously served on the police force in Kirkwood. MO, rhc
sire orTruman stare University. a dry mmpus which, during his ten.
me there, had seen several students die ofaloohol poisoning. Asubsc—
