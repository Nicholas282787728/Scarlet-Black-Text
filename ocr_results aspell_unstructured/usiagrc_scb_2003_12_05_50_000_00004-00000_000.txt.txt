Grinnellians go to
Georgia to protest

the SOA

by Lauren Standifer

On November 23. 2003. n connngeni ofnhoiir
15 Grinnell College students and one Grinnell ml?
member rrrveled halfway across the couniry ro pny
nvisn to Fort Boriningm-niy Base in Georgie. Their
mission was tojoin a movement to shut down the
Wesrern Hemisphere lnsiirine ior Secnrny Coapv
orriion, iormorly ind frennsnrly snll called School
oFtheAmericu (SOA). SOA is a U.S. military pio-
gi-nm rhsr is widely neeiised ofneiniiig Littin Americ
can military ofﬁcers in methods used to violate the
hunien righrs of rheir own cirieens.

on rhe morning nfrhe Nov. 20 seveiril cnrs lofr
Grinnell ﬁlled with students and enough food to
tide them over on the long drive to Georgia. Chris
Grunr. e lihrsrisn at Burling, end her deiighrers
took a charter bus full of other protesters. On Fri-
dsiy niglrr, the srudenrs stayed in nelrnreh wirh orher
protesters.

Saturday morning, the
srndenrs rrrendsd s prerpro»
rissr rally. According ro Linda
Wells ’05, the milirery per—
sonnel on the base blasted
purrioiic music over loudc
speakers in an attempt to dls»
suade the dissidents. Speak»
ers talked about atrocities
cornmirred by SOA gradu»
ates ForWells. the mosr pow»
erful psrr of the event was
hearing the sroriss of rhoss
who survived violence at the
hands ofSOA alumni.

The mom proresr took
plseeon Sundzyand was pm»
sented as a funeral march. Wells estimated that there
were approximately 10,000 people there. Protest-
cirs solemnly carried crosses while the names ofvic-
rims ofSOA graduates were rend. After each name,
the protesters raised their erosses end said
“prisenrs.” as a symbolic my ofshowing that the
dad are still present. Thisycir. Gaunt and her three
companions took erosscs bearing the names offour
missionaries who were raped and murdered by SOA
graduates in El Salvador during the civil war in
1990.

The SOA has n controversial hisrory dating heck

America.”

Gaunt has been attending the annual proresr

the event in a sermon nnd ofrered rrrnsporrrrion

fnsr protest Gaunt nrrendod was vastly difreienr
from those that have followed Sepr. 11,2001. Hei
fiisr yeni, the propersy hns surrounding the hose
wrs simply s pninred line, nnd over 2,000 protest»
ers. ineliiding Gnnnr. risked nrresr hysrormingonro
the hiss. However, in 2001 n chain link fence
topped with hsrhed Wire was erected nronnd the
insrrllnrion, and only the moss deiermined protests
ors crossed it. sinoe rhcrs were for fewer violators
to catch, nil time for those who found n wny onrn
the peso wns virinslly guaranteed. in 2002, Gaunt
msde the derision to go onro the hose. She wrs
given a $750 fine, and was senieneed to 90 deys of
irilnme, which she served earlier this year.

Gsiinr described her nine in a Georgia prison
is an overwhelmingly posirwe experience, nnd said

shnr prison is no longer n ihresr to her. She was
considering crossing the fence rgsin rhis year, our
the weekend prior ro the SOA proresr, she attended
an nnti»occupation demonstration in Des Moines
whersshewus arrested and ehsrgsd with ssssulron
an officer. Gniinr sees the ehiin es ridiculous, since
she is s devout pineririoner of non-violence. Nev-
erdielee, sinoe she is already tied up in the courr
system, she decided nor to risk arrest at rhis year's
SOA islly.

Prorssrors are not sure whether their serions
will hrws much ofsn effser on the fire ofrhe instl»

Homing thinks that the main goal ofrhc pro.
iosr is to publicize the SOA issiic. Shc firmly be-
lieves that “lfmore people knew rhsr they were he

Wells thinks that its “feasible" rhni the govern-
msnr eould listen ro proresreis' demands, lseoense
“we're nor asking rhsm tu shnr down the whole
military." She says rhsre lsill now in Congress could
shnr down the school, snd encourages students ro
write to their rspressnssrives shour the issue.

Gaunt hes no doubts shonr the effectiveness of
the protests, and sztid she “knows" that the sehool
will be shut down.
