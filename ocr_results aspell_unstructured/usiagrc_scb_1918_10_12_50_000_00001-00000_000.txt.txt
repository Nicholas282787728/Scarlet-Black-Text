“It was, however, the Third Repub.

state bore all the eapcnscs that such
a program entailed. \

“There are three kinds of training:
Priinairc, sccondairc, superieiir.

“The ‘prunairc' training received in
the school primairc is free, nonrscce

“The secondary training which is
given in the uycccs' and in thc 'Colr

than the lyoee) is not free. Separate
schools exist ii- hoys and for girls. Tllel
