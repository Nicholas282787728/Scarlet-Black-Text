The Corn Pa ace

Each week the $528 sends one Grinnellian to explore a Midwest oddity

March 11, 2001

 

BY CHRIS NEUBERT

Because I am from South Dakota, some people have a
hard time taking me seriously. The only things many Ameri-
cans can recall about my home state are a few gimmicks
designed to lure gullible tourists off the interstate. First,
there is Mount Rushmore, the famous mountain carving of
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore Rex that many
Grinnellians would consider a symbol of U. S. imperialism
and oppression. Then there is the Corn Palace.

The king otail tourist traps is the World 5
Only Corn Palace in Mitchell, a structure
that truly represents the best that South Da-
kota has to offer after plans for the McGow
ern Presidential Library fell through

The Corn Palace is the original South
Dakota publicity stunt. Built in 1892, the
Palace had two primary goals. Its ﬁrst objec-
tive was to show the rest of the world that
something — corn _
could actually be grown
in South Dakota and thus
people should want to live
there. The second goal
was to advance the “city
of Mitchell and its failed
bid to become the state
capital. imagine for a
moment if they had been
successful, though. Would anyone have felt
threatened by South Dakota if they banned
abortions last summer in a palace made of
corn?

Contrary to popular belief, the Corn Pal-
ace isn’t even constructed of corn. The corn
is used to create a series of murals on the
building‘s exterior and interior walls. Each
year, the murals are redesigned and local corn
is used to create a new facade based on a new
rheme.This year the theme, prominently dis-
played in large red corn letters above the front
doors,is “Salute to Rodeo." The entire palace
is topped offwith three onion shaped domes
and two rrrirrarers rharl thinkare designed to

The orig/rial (om Palate was de»
signed to resemble the Kremlin,
, but was redesrgned In the 79205
when South Dakota derided ll

make the palace look like an old mosque. The
original Corn Palace was designed to iesemble
the Kremlin, but was redesigned in the 19205
when South Dakota decided it didn’t like Rus-
sia anymore.

Inside the front doors are panels explaining
What the various designs represent. There are
a lot ofimagcs otrncn riding horses, some men
riding bulls, one man praying and a woman
riding a horse. In the center
of the Corn Palace, right
above the front doors, is an
image of a father holding
his son‘s hand, apparently
after enjoying a particularly
enthralling rodeo. The
panel explains, “Every little
boy looks up to his father
and wants to grow up to be
just like him. In rodeo families this is espe-
cially true.” I guess lwouldn't know
if this is true. I’m from more ofa
rcc ball family.

Unlike other Midwest tourist
attractions, the Corn Palace actur
ally has a real function: it’s a gym.
Well technically, it’s a “convention
center," but really the only big cons
vcnrions that are ever held there are
basketball games, so it’s really just a gym. I
grew up With the Corn Palace. I saw it for the
ﬁrst time when I was six. I believe my reaction
then was pretty much the same as this Spring
Break, when I returned to visit the 01’ CF: “15

that all?" And really, that is all. The Corn
Palace is South Dakota’s Shrine of Disap-
pointment.

Somehow, the Corn Palace didn’t even
seem as vibrant as I remember the last time I
was underwhlcmed there is years ago. Most

of the rooms in the Corn Pal-
ace were locked, and there wasn’t
anyone around, which may not be
surprising considering that tech
nically the tourist season hasn't
started yet,

For the first time in Corn Pal-
ice history, the murals were not
removed and replaced this year and
the annual Corn Palace Festival was cancelled.
A severe drought has racked the state for the
past several years and the corn crop that was
supposed to refurnish the Corn Palace never
grew. Appaiently, one unintended conse-

bounds

quence ofglobal warming is that the Corn Pals
ace will now be forced to salute rodeo for two
years in a row,

The decorative corn covering the Palace is
starting to look tired and worn. If the Corn
Palace dies, it’s hard to imagine Mitchell lasting
much longer. Granted, Mitchell does have oth
er grand vcrrrures, including the World’s Only
Archeodome e a climatescontrolled dome over
a prehistoric village that allows archeologists to
work yeatrround. Really, though, the center of
Mitchell life — literally and culturally A and the
source of the town’s pride for over 115 years has
been the Corn Palace. Built with hope, turned
a little gimmicky, made into an institution, and
now potentially devastated by drought, the fates
of my home state and the Corn Palace are in-
extricably tied. 1, for one, hope rhar both sur-
vive to see another fruitful harvest worthy of
celebrating several rons ofcorn rodeo.

No, no podiums are physical barriers,
psychological separations. I dorrt do that.
