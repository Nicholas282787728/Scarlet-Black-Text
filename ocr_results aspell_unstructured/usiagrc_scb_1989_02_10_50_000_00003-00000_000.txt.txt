Cold language, and culture
New arrivals adapt

to the unexpected l

by Corrie Zoll

A Grinnell House witte»and-
cheese reception was held
Monday evening for Russianr
language and Russian-history
students to welcome nine new
Soviet faces to the Grinnetl
campus. Eight of the visitors
will be students this semeslcr.
They are accompanied by
Professor Viktor Kabakehi.

The group arrived Saturday
after a trip which took them [rom
Leningrad to Moscow, then
through Prague, Montreal, New
York City, and Chicago before
landing in Des Moines. Andrej
Andreevich Popov (Andrew) said
that the winding route still saved
time over a more direct trip.

Although each of the students
has had approximately 12 years
of English, an American college
dialect can be difficult ‘to
understand. “The first day we

came" El’vira Vasil’evna

Shapkina (Elya) said. “I realized
that we studied English {or
nothing, as it is sometimes very
difficult to understand what
lAmet’lCanS] say. It’s hard to get
used to everyone [speaking]
English."

Said Popov, "Ourrdean told
us, ‘You shouldn’t live the way
American students do, but rather
study like them.“ Popov added
that American students are
thought to be very industrious
since they must pay for
schooling and set their own
goals. “Soviet students may be
spoiled," he said. College
students in the Soviet Union are
paid for attending school
according to the grades they
receive.

Shapkina said, “The main
purpose for me here will be. . .
to learn how [Americans] live.
