There has not heeii, nor will there
probably be, taken any torrnal action
on the part or the Trustees delimiting
the spheres ot the oinces oi President

necessary, owing to the [act that there
are few colleges that have hoth omces.

The ambition that prompted the
iouuders is the ambition or those wto
are in charge today. They desire to
moire the colltge strong in every point
and to use all the resources available
ior this purpose. To this cause is
largely due the tact that iowa Col-
lege has secured a digniiiecl and note-
worthy place among the educational
institutions or the country.

When lowa college was rorrnucu,
it was agreed that it should be en-
couraged to grow as rapidly as con

has steadily lrept this purpose in
