The administration’s posture has
brought, and did bring on this
night, a student reaction un-
precedented in recent Grinnell
history, This issue has captured
the imagination of some students

Student reaction to the administrative justt
when was akin to a strange combination of

President Turner recongizes the
very explosive, imperative aspect
of this decision and others of its
kind. Cuts have to be made, can or
will the students make them" The
administration's position is that
quality, but not how that quality is
provided, is the student’s concern,
He has pledged that as much
quality as possible Will be pure
chased through the reshuffled
organization. Furthermore, he
does not expect the quality to

Student reaction to the ad-
ministrative justification was
somewhat akin to a strange
combination oi revival meeting,

and there isn’t really enough exe
cavatitm into other fields,”

The discussion group did come
up with some suggestions on the
subject. Kintner thought the
present major system is a “little
bit too air tight” and perhaps it
sllould be loosened a bit, He also
stated that advisors should steer
their students to a more general
education. People then mentioned
their desire to know Turner’s
opinion on the subject,

Later, the conversation shifted lo
the topics of tutorials and advising
As in last week's meeting iaults
were round in these areas. Again
however, no one came up With any
solutions to the problems.

After the discussion disbanded,
R A. Mike Daley Voiced his opinion
of the conference saying, “l think
thesemeetings are another part oi
the process oi reexamining the
present state oi the college and
hopeiully coming up with
something that has a visionary
tone to it."

Dean Walker opened the
discussion in Main Hall by asking
the students Why attendance at last
week‘s meeting was so low Exe
cuses such as poor publicity and
the open iorum on Wednesday
were oiiered in reply Fifteen
students were present as opposed
to fifty~five the previous week.
Professors Luther Erickson,
Gregory Guroii, John Mohan, and
John Kleinschmidt led the
discussion which was described as
“much more intelligent and
productive than last week’s,"

Comparing the atmosphere oi
the second meeting to the first.
students said it was more
respectiul and sincere. Some
commented, “Last week everyone
just came to complain At this
meeting much more was ac7
complished,”

_ “People came prepared with
more ideas so there was less

bickering.” Mohan said, “I ieel
a lot better about this meeting.
We've had a week to think things
over."

proiects, personalizing faculty
advising. and changing the college
to attract iuture scholars were the
mayor topics oi discussion

Walker presented three alters
natives to reducing the number oi
independent projects: 1) reducing
the number of courses offered in a
department, 2) havmg bigger
classes, or 3) overloading the
faculty with too many independent
projects, Guroff felt that a con-
sCientious faculty could handle the
pressures without diiiiculty and
that office hours should be used for
carrying on academics,

General student opinion was that
the practice oi nonracademic
laculty advising would become
institutionalized and impersonal

One student expressed the
leeling that every class is a course
in human development and in-
troducing life'plarlning workshops
as a requirement would be un-
desirable and unnecessary.
Erickson participated in the
human development seminar
during the summer and ielt “ .
training faculty to advise in human
relationships" is important,

The most unanimous goal Vcr-
balized by the Students and faculty
was preserving academic exV
celience at all costs, Firing any
member or the iaculty or in-
troducing drastic curriculum
changes, the students felt, would
hinder this quest for excellence.
The purpose behind most oi the
proposed changes seemed to be
making the School attractive to
future students,

The point was made that small
liberal arts colleges will be the first
to fold when the number of college
age students declines because
students won‘t be attracted by
academic excellence, To this
meinschmidt asked. ”Why should
we exist without academic exs
cellence7” Concerning changes
Gurofl' said, “Is doing things well
stagnating” Maybe we should all
fall into this kind of stagnation.”

Attracting older students to
Grinnell, reorganizing the dorm
structure, consulting students
about decisions concerning them,
and school budgeting were other
topics that were hashed around. At
the end of the meeting faculty and
students felt united by priorities,
One student said, ”With the
knowledge that the student body
and faculty are going in the same
direction concerning the White
Paper, the college community is
strengthened ”

Fourteen people, including
Professors Christiansen and
Voertman and two alumni, met for
the Loose Hall discussion Tuesday
night. One student, when asked
what she expected to accomplish in
the meeting, responded, “Nothing
really, I doubt that anyone's really
thought about the issues at hand,"
Professor Christiansen Come
merited, ”We’ll develop a sense ot
patient expectancy.”

The overriding issue concerning
students and faculty alike was the
lack of trust exhibited between the
College's administration and its
students, Bob Aldrich, a JunlOI',
stated simply that the ad

'ministration which claims to be

open and receptive to student
opinion has made a series or major
decisions without benefit of any
student input. The question most
requently voiced was, “How can
we. as Grinnellians, develop our
“joyful commuility’ when
President Turner, by ad
ministrative actions, had made It
clear that he has no regard ior
what is going on in the minds oi the
students”

it was noted that there is a
definite discrepancy between the
administration's and the students’
priorities concerning the college
budget. Obviously, the budget
cutbacks which put the axe to
Georgia Dentel's job were made
without any conception oi how
important the Grinnell concert
series and GORP are to the
students. Professor Voertman

 

commented that the ad-
ministration and the students have
dissimilar perceptions ot the
lunctions oi the programs bet
cut. it was the consensus of LR
group that had there been student
input during the recent 9 ':
ministrative shakeup, Preside x
Turner might have realized his
mistake before he made it

Some discussion was generated
on the subject oi increased iowan
enrollment. Professor
Christianseii ielt that it was an
effective manner in which to
establish valuable contacts within
the state, Some agreed that an
increased Iowan admissions pool
would help Grinnellians to become
more involved with activities and

people outside oi the cam ls
community.
An alumni was concerned wn

the paper’s attitude toward
problems of the black community
at Grinnell The Paper seemss‘
isolate the black communi
ditliculties as a separate problem
rather than one which concerns the
entire campus community. She
was interested in developing ways
in which to promote more in-
terracial interaction on campus

Another topic oi discussion was
the student advising system in
relation to the “personal
development” comments in the
“White Paper.” Faculty career
counseling workshops were
suggested as a means by which
[acuity advisers could keep
abreast oi current happenings}
the fields in which their advise
are interested.

Those present were disturbed by
the “White Paper's” proposal »
terminate the Long-range Fiﬁ
ning Committee, the Curriculun
Committee, and the Executive
Council, and replace the three
committees with a Faculty
Council The Longrrange Planning
Committee currently has two
student members. Termination of
the committees and the establish-
ment of the Faculty Council would
leave the student with no voice in
longrrange planning policy It was‘
agreed that any reorganization of
the long-range Planning Chi:
mitiee should include slude
involvement,

The proposed 4-4-1 calendar was
discussed and the group agreed
that a 4-1-4 calendar, with ,
creased emphasis on the Care
Services internship program,
would better serve the students
and iaculty.

Attended by Protessors Kissane,
Duke, and Moyer, as well as the
SGA president, Ruth Montgomery,
and vice-president, Bob Handler,
the discussion in Younkers cenr
lered around three basic issues.
Together with R.A.s Susie Witte
penn and Deb Stuart. a cro_
similar in size to that oi last we
raised the first issue of shal‘éu
experience , .

An attempt to determine in wQ
areas shared experiences could be‘
found was made and such exam-
ples as required courses, tutorials,
and science labs were cited. A
suggested means oi a new shared
experience was placement oi
students who were together in the
same tutorial into one dorm,

One student felt that just the act
of attending Gi'innell was a shared
experience while another believed
that everyone coming together to
discuss the administrative
reorganization was a lurt .
example

The second issue focused on the
idea of faculty advising and the
question oi how much time shollld
be allotted to advising was raised1
However, the question rema' $1
unanswered and the conversalio
shifted to a discussion of the ad-
viser’s responsibilities from which
came the general feeling that the
student’s future life after Grinnell
should be a major concern oi the
adviser.

Finally, the 47471 proposal was
seen as a means of greater
ﬂexibility in terms of choosing
courses. » ,
