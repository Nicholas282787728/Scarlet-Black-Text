Election Rules

Two-Thirds Requirement
Dropped by Council

A revision of men's election rules
to eliminate the requirements of a
two-thirds majority and to prevent
town men from voting was approvd
ed by the Council of House Presl-
dents at the weekly meeting of
that body Thursday night.

abandoned in favor of a simple
majority because of the difficul-
ties which arose lsst year under
the former plan." John McMurray,
prcsident of the Council explained
this morning. “Because of this
we felt that it would be better for
all concerned if the candidate was
declared elected when he obtained
one more vote than half the to-
