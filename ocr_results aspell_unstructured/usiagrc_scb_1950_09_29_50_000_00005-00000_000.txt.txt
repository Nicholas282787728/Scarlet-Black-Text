male students this fall. The an—

receives questionnaires daily
from local draft boards seeking
v iiication of the fact that men
registered are bona fide students
properly enrolled and attending
classes So far, students have
not been called under the selec-

Men who are ln the active res
serve stand much less chance of
deferrment regardless of their
scholastic status. l

Men are registered for the
most part-at boards in their
home cities and towns. Thail-
orders are then forwarded here.‘
Deal'l Duke is the official rengr
trar for men living on campus
and all men havmg their eightv
eenth birthdays here should reg—
ister with him. The registration
can lhen be sent to his home
board.

Dean Duke mentioned the fact
that the apparent basis for selec-
tion cannot be regarded as a
rule and will be subject to
change with the national and
international political situation.
