Another interesting aspect n[ i

the elections are the symbols r

we think or the elephant and l

Republicans and Democrats,
their otiicial symbols are the

(”The Operational Point of View "

iportallcc in physics HQ said that

Grant 0 Gale ’tphysicsi in :l‘
lccturc last Wednesday discusscd‘

On chilcsdav, March 9. at Si
mm. in room 5 of the sciencer

building. Roger J. Hanson (physﬁ

165] will continue the March
physics series uhcn he considers
~~The Uncertainty Principle and‘
Wavc-Particle Duality.”

Gale deiined the operational l
point oi view in the words ot'
Nobcl prize winner Percy
Bridceman as “the view that
the true meaning oi a term is ,
to be round by what a man
does with, it, not by what he
says about it."

To illustrate this view Gale
cited the Arabic number system
and the Pythagorean theorem,
which are both built on number-
of operations. ‘

In his discussion of dimell»
sions, Gale said that the (undue .
mentals, of length, mass and
Lillie are determined in terms '
of operations and are not argu-
able. He pointed out that the
operational point of View works
in classical mechanics but does
not work in atomic physics.

The .. creelness of small whole
numbe was pointed out by
Gale, who emphasized their im~

the operational point oi view
