The Grinnell Posse Plus Retreat is an annual event that
allows both students and faculty members to discover and
experience a weekend full of discussion and self- reﬂection.
The retreat, which took place last weekend at the Marriott
Hotel In Des Moines, hosted mulr' 1e conversations centet~
ing largely around race and ctlin ty. Throughout the entire

almost all activities centered around the question, ‘does race

Amongst the many llest'rons, one in particular asked to idena
tify Gandhi‘s race. he results, which were later shown in a
slideshnw presentation revealed a wide range of answers. From
“Indian” to “human," the answers varied greatly—but only a
small percentage actually identiﬁed Gandhi as being Asian.
Following the survey, a few Posse scholars initiated a giant

‘ieebretker designed to introduce the cadre group. The activ~
ity produced several humorous introductions as members were,

asked to state their name, year and favorite
and “ﬁsh” were

the two crowd favorites Following the
introductions, the entire room was then ' ‘ '

Amongst the various activities petfomoed during the two

the aptly titled "Human Barometer" activity .At the front of

the room, two signs, one titled “Race Matters” (or 2:) and the

other “Race Does Not Matter," (or 717) ftmclione ’as the two -

exercise pitted several members on opposite ends of an invisible

choice, allowing both crowd participation and interach'on.
Closing the weekend were two Pesse~favorites~diodes
and warm ﬁrzzies. As both function to promote friendship, the
diodes require two people to go offon their own and ask each

Jacolo’ 5 basic assumptions—please co- operate, don’t cooperate

On my GOOP trip p, Ross Preston told me that I should
have a ralk radio show where I could tell people my weird ideas
and have people call in to argue with rne.Then I realized that
not enough people listen to the radio to make a talk show via

me that I should have a column in the 5803 to get my crazy
ideas out there. .

So, here I am. I encourage people to email me responses
and Iwill respond to them. lr sounds hokey, bur I am really try

for emciency goes so much against inhereni human needs as
to actually reduce their happiness even though their material

for everyone to eat out every night than to ever cook for them-

It may be that the American fast food diet leads
to obesity and its associated healih problemsr This
would be less of a problem if many people in the
world weren’t trying to emulate Americans blindly
because it's “cool."Alse, diversity makes life beautiful and inter—
esting. A world where you could never stumble upon a kind of
ﬂower you’d never seen because all of nature had been destroyed
would be a sad one. Likewise a world where everyone dresses,
thinks and acts the same is also boring,

These themes will permeate all of my columns bur I would
like to brieﬂy give one example of what l-mean. I have a via
sion for communities in the United States that would, I believe,
make people happier, increase diversity and potentially increase
efficiency. 1 lament the destruction of the community in the
United States. It has been associated with greater mobility and

emciency bur much has been lost in the process. Since we are
no longer as dependent on family and neighbors for our very
lives, we often neglect these bonds.

I envision a restructuring ofour communities to where peer

ple cooperate. As families have
shrunk and women have entered
the workforce, home cooking has
decllned as well. These two dc-
vclopmenrs are good and are to
be expected given how techno}
ogy has developed in our society
However, 1 think in the process
we have lost much ofour culture
and have lost a piece afour lives
that can make us happy.
I propose an idea rhar I have experimented with over the
past couple years—cooking corops. Let’s imagine that there are
three families offour people each,who live in the same neighr
borhood. They would rotate cooking duties, so that you had to
cook for 12 people every three days rather than for four people
every day. This is much more cine-rent and allows people to fear
sibly cook geod meals rather than eating out. It also strength
ens peoples’ bonds with their neighbors and rejects which could
eventually lead to formation of actual culture in America as
opposed to our consumer culture which is prone to fads and
crass materialism

This is about the Limit ofwhatl can say this time, but I will
finish describing my ideal community in the next installment.
This was just a taste of what sort of things I plan to talk about.
Ultimately, this column will be about being conscious abour
the social, ecological and cultural decisions that we make as a
society.
