Pure Bunk

Dear dead darling duckling died a
dreadful death one day. Feeble both
in feet and feathers by fate, she fell
in a fearful fashion upon the fifthy
floor after a feverish feud.

Her master and mistress, mindful of
her mental might, mourned all morn-
ing until they motioned to n. mes-
senger to get a minister for midnight
mass. The story stands that she was
stretched in state in a street strewn
with statues and stemmed sprays of
,spirea, while students stood near, still
as stars. 41,

Tinted tapers, tall as temples, form<
ed a tribute at each termination of
the tub on top of the tools. until time
pieces ticked two. Those fond of the
former one could not forget her al-
though they were forbidden to look
upon her with their flushed faces.
The flowers were fondled while a
‘ faultless flutist fluted.

The cheerless candles were compar—
atively low when the crowd came,
‘each carrying candy and oak . NO one
‘kiiew the need or the necessity of
their neighbors that night on account
of their nervous nature.

After the alcoves and alleys as well ,
as the archway-s were ﬁlled that April
'day, not another answer was articu-
lated as the artitss began their nr-
rangements. The organist in s beau-
tiful black bodice and bonnet
hreathlessly boomed on the big broad
board, while the angel with white
wings and a wealth of white woven
woulstuff wrinkled wrists and war-
bled wistfully’.’

The preacher preached his pitiful
'piece and the whole place was a per-
sonified picture.

Then poor ducky wss dumped in the
ash can and that was the end of
Skiiptia, Dorothy Morrison's chins
lduck pin cushion.
