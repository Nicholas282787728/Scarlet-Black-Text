on Human Rights, the article (titled
"The Forgotten Prisoners") also
called attention to the plight ofpeo—

suggested that governments would
respond to letters on behalfof pris<

movement could force them to live
up to the Declaration.

In a quarter of a century, Am»

movement ofover 1.1 million mem»
bers in over 150 countries who work
on behalf ofthousands of victims of
human rights every single year.

Amnesty has already been in.
volved in the release of over 45,000
prisoners. in addition to Amnesty-s
work to release prisoners, Amnesty
has other misstons, as explained in
their mandate, to the right. One of
these missions involves bringing to
light human rights abuses after the
fact. For example, one man spent
weeks blindfolded and isolated and

A prisoner comes to know about Amnesty’s work on his behalf
usually only indirectly, from the sarcastic remarks of his
jailers...but it is enough to give him a wonderful feeling that he is

not completely forgotten after all, that somebody cares.
—A Czech Prisoner whom Amnesty helped liberate

His last words before he signed your release \VctC, “Not more bloody letters from Amnesty!”
You have encouraged me to go on fighting in the certainty that
there exist in this violent world people who believe in the value
of the individual and who are ready to devote time and effort to

save one person.

§N

I did not experience a human face or see a green
leaf, and my only company was cockroaches and mice.
The only daylight that entered my cell was through zi
small opening at the top of one wall. For eight months
I had my hands and feet tied.

On Christmas Eve the door to my cell opened and
the guard tossed in a crumpled piece of paper. I moved

as best I could to pick it up.

It said simply: “Constantino, do not be discour»
aged! We know you are alive.” It was signed
“Monica," and had an Amnesty International candle
on it. These words saved my life and my sanity. Eight

months later I was set free.

~One of the more than 45,000 prisoners whose
cases Amnesty International has helped resolve.
