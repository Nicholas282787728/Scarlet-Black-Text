Arseneauit shatters NCAA assist record

Proves that polarizing System works, even if it doesn’t quite fit a DII] philosophy

If men’s basketball head coach David Arseneaulr (Coach A)
gathered the System naysayers in a room to explain the motiva-
tion behind his son’s (Kid A) 34’355151 bonanzaia crowded
room, given the reactionihc might as well do it in Latin. Not
a single person coaching in Division III basketball has the same
approach as Grinnell's System mad seientrst, and it’s not even
close. To fully appreciate the system requires a complete res
evaluation of what you think you know about basketball.

So when Kid A put up 34 assists last samrday, it merely
served as further proof that we aren’t even on the same planet
as our foes. Other teams idolize records as the rare stratospheric
achievements of superior players. Saturday's game proves that
we can break one practically whenever we want.

Sclﬂsctving? You better believe it. Conch A’s got a highly
calculated and highly successful pier
gram here, a major sports team actually
succeeding at a school like Grinnell. To
continue his run otwinniug seasons, he
needs to give the limited number of re-
cruits who can actually get into Griiinell good reason to spend
four years here.

The reason? The chance to break unreachable statistical
plateaus. Ever wanted to lead the nation in scoring with 30
points per game and still not feel like you’re hogging the hali>
Come to Grinnell. Want to dish out 34 assists when your team
only makes a quarter oftheir threes? Come to Grinnell, Each
group must put up their own mindrboggling set of statistics,
both ro get Grinneil press and to bring in the next class ofgteat
ﬁrstryears.

“You have to inﬂate the egos," said Coach A, “so that they
can become conﬁdent beyond what they think they could be

goal of whining and losing, we’re using them as a motivating
factor. Apparently, 30 points a game convinces you that you can
take on the world, and given John Grotberg’s inability to stop
shooting sometimes, l'm inclined to believe it.

There’s still the sportsmanship issue, though. while the
North Central coach told me he had no problem with the res
cord, the objectors vocally emerged at the Mecca ror small-coir
iege basketball. D3hoopscom.

“What Griiiiicll did on Saturday was take ad‘mntagc ofa
weaker team and embarrass the Gnnneil name aiid oppo-
nent,"snid one. “its not about playing minures, it’s about going
out otyonr way to intentionally break a record in a premedr
tilled fashion,” said another.

In standard basketball rhetoric, those arguments are valid,
While Coach A can assert that he
thinks about sportsmanship and never
tries to nui up the score, the fact that
Grotberg took four three—pointers in
the last two minutes ofa 40rpoint win
with Gririncll’s five best players on the ﬂoor suggests his tactics
are not foolproof. Because as far out of mainstream as Coach
A might be, he still has to deal with the mainstream and play
them 20 times a year. But that doesn't mean he should change.

The system works iterate it confounds and annoys baskerr
ball purists, turning statistical impossibilitics into normal occurs
rences and leaving most fans skeptical, thinking, “Did thcyjust
do that?" For every record we break, we might receive 10 letters
decrying our sportsmanship and one great recruit. Problematic?

Straight honesty. It’s something that a journalist rarely
hears from an athlete. We’ve even created a category of cli-
chés to describe the way athletes say something, but really say
nothing at all, like “Without hard work from my teammates
and support trom my family and friends I could not have
done it." Every once in a while, we get a little more. Pose
sibly hardened by four trying years as a srar of the Grinnell
women's basketball team, Hannah Wolf’OS spoke her mind in

Tell me about your prior basketball experience.

In high school I played for a very good team with lots
of very rail girls, so it was a big change to come here and
not have anyone over six feet It was also a change to play
with smart teammates. The average academic level here is a
lot higher than it was in high school so its a diﬁerent armors

we havent used the System since my ﬁrst year, and they

For the Central game we came out right away ready to
win and you could tell from our ﬁrst play that we were going
to win that game, We prepared for it pretty well and we knew
they were a similar team to us, 0-6, so it was a really important

I’d like to have a winning season. I’ve never had that. I

David Arseneault YO9 is known for his ability to find the
open man, owning Grinncll’s assist record as a junior and avers
aging more than almost any other player in any division.

But no one expected Saturday's output. The Pioneers’lSl-
112 victory over North Central (Minn) not only secured their
seventh win at the season, but added yet another record to their
name. After 86 passes, Arseneaulr finished with 34 assists, shalt
tering the old NCAA assists record onb.

The intention was never to get Arseneault that many as-
sists, though. “The game plan was to getJohn [Gtotberg ’09]
and Keith [Chamberlain '08] a lot of points,” said Arseneault.
Grotberg and Chamberlain would play in lOrminute shifts, tar
longer than usual. with Keith cheating up in the press to get
poruts off turnovers and John taking a signiﬁcant portion of
Grinnell's three-point shots,

Bur when neither player scored enough points, the focus
shitred. “After halftime, we adjusted rhe gamepian," said Arser
neriult, designed to get him the assists needed to. the record.

player would shoot unless Arseneault passed rhem rhe ball,gi\~

“From D3hoopscuin to LSl’N Ziiitl a couplt it local media
outlets." But the attention hasn't liecn all poo ,i ’tli some
questioning the legitimacy otArseneault‘s rccord,r: ming that
he is a product of Grinnell's stats-driven offense and that the
record came not rn a close game, bur in a 40-point blowout.

Ironically, Arseneault could have gotten even more assists,
since the team as a whole did not have a great shooting night,
only hitting 26.7 percent from beyond the are. Had the Pie
onecrs hit their average or better, 40750 assists were not out
of the question. Neither coach nor sou secured uneasy about
breaking the record by that much.

Coach Arseneault stressed that with his System, lie cali use
records as a motivational tool. “The hope is that our guys are
going to be equally up for games against bad teams,” often cn‘r
pliasizing srats and Conﬁdence over winning, Arseneaulr said, It”
the team is confident, “then the wins take care of themselves.”

By that logic, Coach Arseneaulr should have three incredr
rbly conﬁdent players going into winter break. Chamberlain
controlled the paint, hitting 16 otzz for 39 pornts and throw-
rug down more drinks than ire had in his ﬂist seven games corn-
bined. Grotberg hit 14 of38 from three tor 49 points.

Like any selﬂess point guard, Arseneault wouldn’t rake all
the glory. “l have to credit my teammates for getting those shots
in,"said Arseneaulr. “I am just passing them the ball."
