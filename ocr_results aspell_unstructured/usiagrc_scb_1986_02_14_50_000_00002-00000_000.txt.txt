Dibble residents forced to ﬂee

by May-lee Chai

Black, acrid smoke billowed from Dib-
ble lst and penetrated to the third floor
before fire alarms blared to life at 4:18
am, Sunday, February 9,

The sleeping residents of Dibble Hall
were awakened by the screaming siren or
by other students who ran down their floor,
pounding doors to alert others oi the possir
ble fire.

It was later determined that the the
source of the pervasive smoke, which two
days later still pervaded the hall, was a
Tombstone pizza lelt to smolder in the
oven on Dibble lst while its owner snoozed
Much confusion resulted as students tried
to figure out what was happening and what
they should do.

Ironically, the third ﬂoor was the first to
evacuate and ﬂee outside into the bitter
cold. Dibble 2nd experienced difficulties
because some residents did not hear the
alarm. and others who did, convinced
themselves the sound was something other
than the fire alarm.

Residents of Dibble Annex thought the
noise was due to a iaulty battery in the hall
smoke detector as the same sound occur-
red earlier last semester. Consequently,

the Annexites did not make an attempt to
clear the building until after they had
removed their smoke detector and then
replaced it aiter determining it was not the
source of the siren.

Gerald Arment, who works at the
Physical Plant, reported mat two smoke
detectors had been removed during the
morning’s disorder, causing some wiring
to be disconnected. Also, a battery-
powered detector in an individual‘s room
had been triggered and was silenced by the
resident. Building and Grounds have since
put the detectors back in working order,

The confused residents were still filing
outside when the owner of the smoking piz»
Za informed mem of the cause of the
smoke and that there was no iire. They
then returned to their rooms.

However. as the smoke had not
dissipated, the alarm still blared away.
Several students attempted to clear the
smoke, opening all the windows in Dibble
lst and setting up electric ians. When the
Buildings and Grounds personnel finally
came, the alarm system for the entire hall
had to be shutoff.

For most Dibble inhabitants, Sunday
mornings alarm proved to be an eye-

SGA Briefs _-

by Mike Cleary

The bylaw to prohibit SGA from making
charitable contributions was defeated
Wednesday night.

Discussion began with the proposed
amendment which would allow monies
other than student activities fees to be uss
ed for charitable purposes. Approximately
$8,000 would be available for such pur-
poses under the amendment,

Russ Matteson said that Finance Coma
mittee met with Bob Towner-Larsen. He
said that their understanding was that
SGA funds could be used only for student
activities. Using SGA funds lor charity
could lead to legal difficulties, given the
way the budget was accounted.

Matteson added that he felt that charity
was a concern of individuals and inap-
propriate for SGA.

Enrique Menor said that he understood
that revenues from the book sale and other
sources were available for charitable pur-
poses. The SGA President assented that
book sale money in the past had been used
{or a variety of purposes.

It was pointed out that the Forum pinball
machines were not owned by SGA. The
company that owned them ielt mat the
.machines would be used less if they were
designated tor charitable purposes,

‘ Finance Committee said that the only
charity allowed by the college to solicit on
campus was United Way Cantor said that
this was a precedent ior charity

Dave Simon said that SGA did not have
the right to donate money in anyone else's
name.

It was asked whether any money from
the budget surplus could be used for
charitable purposes. Matteson responded
that there will be no surplus at the end of
the current semester, The previous
surplus occurred because of the upsurge in
student activities fees due to the increased
number of students, he explained. He add-
ed that surpluses were unlikely to be seen
in the hiture. ,

It was moved to decide the issue and the
by-law was defeated. twelve “no” votes to
eleven “yes” votes. To pass, a by»law to
the constitution has to receive two thirds
majority approval.

Mike Marcus of Finance Committee sug-
gested that they could discuss the issue
with Bob Towner-Larsen on Monday and
see if they could find a way to enable SGA
to make charitable donations. They said
that accounting methods made uncertain
the legality oi donating money out or SGA
funds. '

opening experience in more ways than
one,

“I thought the alarm system was hooked
directly to the fire department.”
Sophomoe Lisa Grant said. ”1 had no idea
we were supposed to call them."

Most of the students did not know, in
cluding Hall Activities Committee
member Meg Litts. who remarked that the
incident proved “we need more awareness
or the alarm system and procedure for
tires.”

at the HAC meeting Monday night, the ,

pros and cons oi non-directlinkage to the
fire department were discussed. one stus
dent noted that it had taken ten minutes
bciore anyone of authority had appeared
Sunday. However, it was also pointed out
that the tire department would be over at
the college all the time ii they had to res
pond every time a smoke detector went
off

According to Arment, the moment the
central hall alarm goes oit, the computer
system prints out a message to the main
computer in the physical plant. Other
messages are printed out to the heating
plant. The night watchman is notified by a
“beeper" type paging system to go to the

Guest ‘

nearest computer printer where the time
ol the alarm and location are relayed.

The current guidelines for
“Fire/Emergency Procedures”, which
a re required to be posted on every floor, do
state that students are supposed to call the
fire department (911) in case of a fire.
However, many students have not
familiarized themselves with the pro-
cedures. _

Sunday’s incident proved this to Dibble
Hall residents. Fortunately nothing more
serious than a few hours oi sleep was lost,
However, in addition to the pungent eflects
oi the smoke. the painiul realization of
their coniusion and ignorance or how to
respond in a tire emergency remains to the
dorm members.

Speakers Debate

by Mike Cleary

Professor Roger Brooks from the
Heritage Foundation spoke last Thursday
night in South Lounge on the question,
“Should the U.N. be Involved in
Guaranteeing Social and Economic
Rights?" After he spoke. Professor Burns
Weston gave a rejoiner to his remarks

Brooks suggested iour basic distinctions
which should be used as criteria tor human
rights policies: 1) ideas and institutions, 2)
rights and goals, 3) intentions and conse
quences, 4) public or political and private
moralities,

Brooks said that ideas and words can be

' manipulated far more than institutions.

ideas and words can make it appear uiat
human rights are being respected in
politically repressive regimes. Treaties
and poltical documents do not
automatically create the observance of
human rights in those regimes. Ideas do
not constitute human righm in practice.

Brooks contended that the respect and
observance of human rights lay in the
ways of life, “the institutions and habits"
oi the people of a nation.

He Said that “rights” exclude' many
economic and social issues Such as those
on the agenda of the “New Economic
Order.” He mentioned the rights to na-
tionality, culture, and marriage as ex
amples of “goals" which should not be
called “rights." The rights “to liberty,

law. and opportunity” and freedom irom
torture were cited by him as genuine

ri hts.
e said that development “is not a right

but a necessity." He held that economic
and social rights, though supportive of
political and civil rights, were not in the
same category as the latter, Brooks held
that economic goals at countries should be
handled through economic aid. He said
that advancing the cause oi social rights
was often a cover ior political repression,
such as coniiscation oi private property
without compensation.

He called ior an “ethic or consequences"
to guide human rights policy-making, in-
stead oi an “ethic of motives,"

He advised that human rights policy
should not concern iecli with “political
morality," or the aims and aspirations ofa
nation as a political unit. Human rights do
not include the aims oi governments.

Finally. he warned that the problem rac-
ed by us. lawmakers in deciding whether
to ratify the International Covenant on
Social, Economic, and Human Rights was
that civil and political rights are ,not
respected in some signatory countries,
Brooks characterized U.S. ratification as
establishing an ”unholy alliance" with
those countries it they failed to guarantee
such rights.

Weston said that Brooks had used an
ethnocentric definition of rights as
political and civil rights and that this View
did not take into account other definitions
0|" rights, such as social and economic, or
second generation, rights He called for
taking as global perspective in determine
ing the definition of human rights. Other
conceptions oi rights should not simply be
treated as “mere aspirations."

He said that authoritarianism and social
and economic rights do not necessarily go
together. He went on to say that collecr
tivist Values are compatible with in
dividualistic ones and that our own nation
doesn't have one set or rights, but “a big
mix.”

He oiiered [ive general characteristics
oi human rights. 1) Human rights balance
individual and group demands and imply
respect for one another. 2) They are
universal in character. 3) They are not ab
solute but relative. 4) The emphasis in

. rigllts lies in needs. 5) Human ri hts ex-

press both the “is” and the “ough they
straddle the moral and the legal; they in-
clude aspirations,

“Each stateshall undertake to try," he
quoted from Article 2, Section lnf the his
ternational, Covenant, saying that it
represented a goal lor nations to strive for.
Our legal concern lies in holding to the
commitment.

Brooks responded that the defense ot
political rights is a “fundamental obligar
tion of our people in the human rights
arena,” He said that we “water down"
human rights by introducing other “adjec-
tives” and notions such as the “freedom oi
child care " He defended the idea or using
policy to promote institutions which sup—
port basic human liberties and rights. We
“need a system which respects basic
human rights and ireedoms as we know
them," he said.
