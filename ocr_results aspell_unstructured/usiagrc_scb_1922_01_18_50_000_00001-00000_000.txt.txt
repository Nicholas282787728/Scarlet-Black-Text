One Himself.

In Spite of their spirited playing, the
Pioneer basketeers were forced to ac—
cept deteat at the hands or the strong
Nebraska quintet when’the two teams
met in the large fair grounds Colises
um at Lincoln last Saturday nighL Ale
though they had gone through a see
Vere grind. With Missouri on the pre-
vious night the Nebraskans showed a
rest oftense which the Grinnell guards
round it diiricult to stop

Grihneli used a short pass system
which proved eﬂective against the
Cornhusker guards but ‘the poor luck

essary counters prevented the Pion-
eers irom making as good a showin‘g
in the scoring column as they made
in their ﬂoor work. The new system
devised ‘hy Coach “Bud" Saunders is
attracting considerable attention ana,l
although it is a yet in the rudimentary-
smge, it gives great promise or suc-
cess as the season progresses

Nebraska on the other handseemed
to depend on a rather hit or miss
style or play which was a mixture or
both the short and long pass. Capt.
Smith, the much .vnunted star of the
Cornhusker aggregation, and. Capt
Macy oi Grinnell were pitted against;
each other throughout the game,’ the
Grinnell captain having evidently
been instructed to watch his rival cap—
tain. In this interating contest the
decision easily went to the Pioneer
pilot who held his charge to one long
shot i-rom far out in the door, while'
he himseit also found time to slip:
down the .door and slip a ringer thru‘
the mesh. A

Benz, the lanky Grinnell center.
was the individual star or the game
with two ticid goals and nine tree
throws chalked up to his credit. Smith
was next ~iu line with one gold goal
and live foul tosses to his credit. nus.
sci mi Warren each counted three
baskets train the ﬁeld. ,

Towards the latter part of the game
Coach Saunders substituted rather
freely in order to give some of hls
new men on the squad a little experlr
ence with the Nebraska type of play.
Otherwise the score or the Nebrask-
ens conid,have been kept down to a
lower ﬁgure.

However in spite of their detect the
Fioneers showed considerable im-'
provement over their showing in their

hoped that they will continue the good

Dr. Giomaet of Des Moines Ex-
poses Methods of Quaeks.

“Quacking is trying to treat a dis—
ease about which you know nothing,
with methods Which you don’t uunller-
stand " was Dr. Daniel .1. GlomsetSi
definition which he gave in a speech
beiore the Science club last Monday
evening. Dr. Glomset la a well known
pathologist or Des Moines and is cai-
uected with Mercy Hospital

He traced the histlory oi uuackcry
1mm the time or savage mend
the present time. He told how the“ am
cients tried to drive out evll splrit‘s
by chanting and how a simple metallic
rod possessed "marvelous" healing
powers. Then the savage concocted
various herbs which was a foundation
for modern medicine, and in this act
stepped trom quackery to medicine, or
at least a beginning of medicine. l

,Mr. Glomset spoke at various cults
and methods used today, including the
ouacks, and prophesied that as soon as
the people would wake up to scientiﬁc
medicine quackipg will be lost The
science or medicine is becoming more
and mom s. known procedure or treat-
ment in opposition to the unknown at
quackcry.

After the main speech' the subject
was thrown open tor discussion, and
many questions were cleared up in
this way. Following the meeting Br.
Clomset was entertained at a social
hour at the College Club, to which all
those present at the meting were in-
vited.

In Bringing on Revolution.

“The Colonial Press as an inﬂuence
on the American Revolution," was the
subject of an interesnng lecture giv.
eh at the Macy club Monday night‘
by Prolcsscr A. M. Schlesinger, head
of the department of History at the
University of Iowa. He discussed the
value of research work in understand.,
ing history, and presented a problem
of historical research having to do
with colonial newspapers. l

"The war for independence was
brought about by a, small number at
people thru the medium of thc press,"
said ppofessor‘ Schlesinger. There
were about sixty newspapers in any
tence in the colonies in 1376, most or
which had sprung up in a few years,
and much valuable iniormaition ls tn’
be gained from these.

it was not until after 1763 that the,
newspapers came in he mouldcrs-oi'
