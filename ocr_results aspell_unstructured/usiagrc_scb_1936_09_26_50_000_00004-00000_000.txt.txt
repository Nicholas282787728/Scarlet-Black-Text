Let us then consider a WPA project at
Michigan State college.

The Michigan school has a good football
team playing on the average of four home
games a season. Last year, one of these
games, with Marquette, was attended by
21,000 people; the other three games their
a total of 19,000 spectators. In other words,
Michigan State college can fill its stadium
only for the Marquette game which is
scheduled at East Lansing every other year.

However, Michigan State officials who
decided that it might be nice to have a
larger stadium applied to the Works Pro~
gress Administration and secured a grant 0
$115,000 to enlarge the seating capacity of
the stadium to 30,000. \

This surely seems to be an extravagant
and wasteful use of public funds—to en-
large a stadium which is entirely adequate.
It is to such “boondoggling” projects as this
that the voters of both parties are object
mg.

A NATION GONE MAD

Spain is engaged in civil war. It is not
a trivial war over small matters, but a bitter
class war fought on principles with world
repercussions. From all reports it is one
of the cruelest wars in all history. Thous-
ands ot' prisoners on both sides have been
massacred in cold blood. At Irun prisoners
were chained in no man’s land and killed by
their own comrades. In the tragic siege of
Alcazar women and children who refused to
surrender, were blown up with the castle.
Every war method is used, even to flooding
the land without consideration of the de»
struction of life and wealth. Apparently
neither side considers making teims for
they seem determined to continue to ruin
their country, the people and the resources,

Not only are the Spaniards ruining their
own country, but they are laying it wide
open to foreign intervention, and increasing
the danger of general war. It is not all
their fault by any means. Italy is evidently
actively supporting the facist rebels with
her airplanes. Germany and some other
nations are lending at least moral support
to the rebels, whereas France, Russia and
Mexico, support the workers' government.
The dangers of this are obvious, the results
unpredictable.

It is obviously impossible for either side
to gain any real advantage from such a
1" rec destructive war Which ever side
wins will be so full of relentless, bitter hate
that it will ruthlessly punish the defeated
enemies. The retarded, backsliding Spain
will lie waiting for the hard task of iecoir
struction with millions of men and billions
of dollars of wealthvwasted. There will be
no settlement between two sides, but one
side will be practically destroyed. Such is
the folly of war. -

The World should learn two obvious leSr
sons from Spain’s example. First, it should
do everything possible to reduce the differ-
ences between classes and make the intel-
yests of all identical; and second, it should
never resort to the ends»defeating‘ method
of war to settle disputes or conflicts.

OBJECTIONABLE BOONDOGGLING

A great deal has been written about the
so—called boondoggling projects of the New
Deal administration Many people consider
these projects merely a method by which
vast sums of federal money are wasted.
We, however, agree that worthwhile pro—
jects are perfectly legitimate as a step to-
ward that end,

It is necessary for us to realize that
there have been some “boondoggling” pro-i
jects whic really have been a foolish expen-
diture of public funds, ’

Grinnell students are acquainted with
Michigan State college because of our rela-
tions with that school on the football field.

WORK AND THE COLLEGE MAN

(Kentucky Kernel)

There fcr'merly has been a sort of halo of
glamour about the lad who ”worked h|S way
through College,” which has finally resulted in a
state of affairs where the greater percentage 01
men entering college are led to a desire to work
for part of their college expenses.

The results of the whole matter are several
dangerous possibilities. In the first place, mer-
chants with an eye on the cash register and not
on the welfare of their collegiate employee, have
begun an exploitation of this type of labor
which would cause labor unions to tear their han-
in agony.

college laborers thus used are not able to
obtain from their college the maximum or nedr~
maximum of benefit. It is .pretty well agreed
among educators that going to college is a full
time job in itself. To attain a well-rounded cule
tural and professional education is much easier if
the student can concentrate entirely upon his edur
cation, although the exceptional lad may be able
to do it while working his way through.

For goodness sake, freshmen, if you don’t
have to work while in college, don't do iL. Parse
coxically enough, you will find that by not work-
img while in college you will receive more and
greater dividends than you would get by working.

G
WITH A RED PENCIL
(Daily Northwestern)

The American people are still democratic
enough to view censors of the press with hearty
disapproval. But there is no censorship more
reprehensible to are American mind than the cen-
sorship of college publications.

This fact was illustrated-recently when edr
torial pages all over the country attacked Dr. H.
Y, Benedict, president of the University of Texas,
for his assertion of the right of the administration
to “ ill" all objectionable material. President
Benedict said that a student newspaper had “no
justification or authority to publish a newspaper
containing political opinions and personal criti-
Clsms” since, as is the case of the Daily Texan,
"the university is the only reason for the paper's
existence."

One need not be a Milton to demolish Dr.
Benedicts straw house. The great flaw in his or
gument, of course, is his usumption that a univer-
sity is run for the benefit of the faculty and Dr.
Benedict. The old guard university officials are
so accustomed to an authoriterian attitude that
occasionally the fact that a university exists in
the interest of the student body seems to fade
from their memory—a case of the absent-minded
professor turned administrator.

A college newspaper is an organ of student
opinion. Representing the majority of students, it
has every right in the worid to attack, praise, or
condone whomever it wishes from the president of
the universiity to the night watchman. There
should in our estimation he no more independent
publication than a college newspaper, since, when
all is said and done, the students are the he-aii
and end-all of an educational institution.

If in their own publication students are denied
freedom of expression, it is their prerogative to
demand it. Properly speaking, Dr. Benedict is the
person who‘should be expelled.

 

John Spencer Gets Position
in American Diplomatic Service

Returns to United States
After Eethiopian War
Terminates

John H. Spencer ’29, son of
Professor and Mrs. E. B. T. Spen-
cer, returned this summer from
Ethiopia, where he was Political
Adviser to the Ministry of For
eign Affairs of the Ethiopian
government. He was seated with
the Ethiopian delegation when
Haile Selassie made his appeal
before the League of Nations As—
sembly in Geneva, Switzerland,
June 30.

Since his return, Mr. Spencer
has been with the Far East divi—
sion of the state department at
Washington, D. 0., Prof. Spencer
said this morning.

“'as Under Fire

During the siege and taking of
Addis Ababa, Mr, Spencer was
under fire at the American legar
tion. The train on which he was
taken to the coast was fired upon
by bandits.

Mr. Spencer expressed great
admiration for the Ethiopian em-

peror, commending him for his
moral and physical courage, pep
sonal energy, and initiative. He
branded reports of theEmpei-or's
withdrawal of large amounts of
gold from the country as entirely
false.
Not a Flight

Haile Selassie‘s expedition to
Europe was not a flight from the
Italians, he stated emphatically.
He went to make a personal ap—
peai to the League oi‘ Nations
against the Italians' use of poison
gas on the northern front.

The diplomats work in Ethio~
pia was chiefly in drafting diplo-
matic notes and dispatches. while
he was at the League assembly, he
was chosen to broadcast an Eng—
lish translation of the emperor’s
appeal, originally delivered in Arm
harm, the native tongue.

For nearly a week in January,
Mr. Spencer was at the northern
front with Haile Selassie. During
a bombardment by Italian planes,
the emperor himself used a gun
to try to bring down an enemy
machine,

Dr. H. W. Norris
Give-s First Talk
at Chapel

“The life of mind rloes not grow
wild on trees," quoted Harry wal-
do Norris, professor of zoology, as
the basis of his talk Friday morn<
ing at the first chapel of the
year. He stressed the importance
cfnurturc of the human mind,
using as an example the large
number of students attending col-
leges throughout the country.

Professor Norris said that the
chief form of exercise that minds
receive is through speech and that
every man and woman should
have the rig-ht of freedom of
thought and freedom of speech,
This freedom is very limited out-
side of the United States and the
British Empire, however, he said.

In exercising freedom of speech,
he continued, the truth must 314
ways be adhered to. However, he
explained, it is difficult to set a,
certain standard of truth as one's
beliefs seem true to one, and it
'often take a great deal of courage
and heroism to express one’s
thoughm though it is the best
course. "It is supremely good to
live for truth,” Mr. Norris con-
cluded.
