Griuneil has been innoculutel‘l with flickers,"

the fighting spirit ever since its ioun—
dation, When the pioneer hand iirst
established Grinnell, it fought against
hardships, climate, and lack oi funds.
But it won, and won so gloriously that
today Grinnell stands as the liberal
arts college or the middle West.

AS Grin-hell grew. the fighting spirit
kept pace with it. Athletics were in-
[minimal Grinnell, an athletic pioneer,
won the iirst baseball game played in
lowa. In 1889 Grinnell engaged with
the university of Iowa in the tirst
recthall game ever played west ot the
Mississippi, Grinnell again proved a
pioneer and came off with a victory
or 24-0. In 1890 the first state track
meet was held. Here Grinnell was
the runner-up. -

A sports writer for the New York
Evening Post once said: "Grinnell was
playing hashetball when the rest of
the state, aside mm a lew Y. M. c. a.
teams, did not know whether the sport
was a new sort oi tatling or a varia-
tion of crckirlole. Grinnell went in for
soccer when the Middle West, or most

On October 25, 1919, the Scarlet
and Black started the agitation for a
distinctive name. The Honor G Cluh
sponsored a name writing contest and
the 1921 Cyclone otter-ed a prize to the
winner. The most popular suggestions
of the 150 submitted were: Cardinals,
Bear Cats, Cubs, Trojans and Pier
neers. The final decisions lay between
the Trojans and the Pioneers. The
latter, submitted by Sol Gilberg, '20,
was chosen because or its obvious sig-
niiicance. Next Monday marks the
fourth anniversary of Grinnell ath-
letic teams as the Pioneers, for on
October 29, 1919. it was oliicially an»
nonnced that Gilbetg‘s suggestion
would he adopted as the name of
Gl'innell's athletic teams.

The term “Pioneers" not only re-
calls the early history ot Grinnell and
Grihnell athletics, but it epitomizes
the sturdy, undaunted, persevering,
and inextinguishahle fighting spirit
characteristic at Grinnell's athletics.
It tells in three flashes the source of
the greatness ot Griunell.
