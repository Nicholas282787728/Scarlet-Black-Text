intensive Scrimmage

Coach John Truesdaie has been
scrimmaging the squad intensively
against the fresh all week in an
effort to assemble the most effec-
tive offensive and defensive unit,
The combination which has worked
most efficiently comprises Oll—
pliant and La Masney at forwards,
Klepfer at center, and McMurray
and_ Dean at guards.

Oliphant, who averaged eight
points per game last year, is a
two year veteran at the front

Upperclass Women Find Effort
to Reduce Difficult Indeed

Reducing Class Organizedl
Some Co-eds Try
Liquid Diets

With the ghost of the Thanks-
giving turkey still hanging over
the campus the preps aren't thAe
only ones who find, as the men's
house parties approach, that their
dresses wrinkle in the front and
are too short in the back. Upper
classmen are just as strenuously
and enthusiastically going over to
the ranks of the would.be stream-
lincrs, and their methods arc
many and varied.

Those girls you’ve seen going
sidewise up the steps of the Libe

and Alumni Recitation hall and
easing themselves gingerly into
classroom chairs, evidently unable

to make up their minds whether

they feel worse standing up or sit-
ting down, are the five pounds-or—
more ovcrweighters of Miss Ander-
sen’s reducing class, The class,
meeting twice a week, is a session
of bending, stretching, rolling and
kicking, topped off by the injunc-
tion to eat one serving at meals,
and to do the exercises on the days
the class doesn't meet. A rapid
and somewhat incomplete checkup
,would indicate that few pounds
have been lost as yet, due to the

Found at Last/
Last Christmas Dolls

They were just about to send
out a riot can for a'souad of G
men. A hundred and fifty dolls
missing—and the Christmas
committee of the Young Wom—
en's Christian association were
about to lose their minds. Teler
grams to the company in New
York. to the contracting store
in Omaha, and even to Santa
Claus brought no results. Grine
nell's poor children seemed
doomed to go without their
Christmas toys.

The women in the quadrangle
who had promised to dress the
dolls as their christmas project
kept the committee frantic with
inquu‘lesiwhen are those dolls
coming?

And then Thursday afternoon
it turned out that the shipment
had been resting peacefully at
Uncle Sam’s club since Tuesday,
delivered to the wrong Ross.
Betsy Ross, chairman of the
committee, had them brought
up to the quadrangle in a hurry
and distributed to the anxiously
waiting would-he foster moth-
ers.
