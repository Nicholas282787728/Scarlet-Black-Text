Eric SeCOy asked about the incréase in
the Kch budget.

Kelly explained, “One goal. that Student
Publications and Radio is trying to get
done is to get separate funding [from
SGA]. I don’t think they [KDICl need an
increase in budget. In fact, if anyone needs
an increase, its the Cyclone. There pro-
bably is room for question."

Discussion ended, and the fall budget
was tabled until next wedf.

A bylaw requiring a $5000 reserve at the
beginning of the year was discussed and
approved. Financial Committee Chair
Vern Juel explained, “The reserve is an
emergency fund. . . should the concerts
chair overspend or something. . This is on—
ly formalizing something that was enacted
last semester. . . it may have to be revised
in future years."

proved by the Committee on Student Life

Educational Policy Committees

help student representation

Getting the scoop on the SEPCs

The SEPCs, or student educational
policy committees, are “part of the chain
that leads to student representation on the
curriculum committee,” according to Bob
Cadmus, physics professor and science
departmen‘ representative to the Cur»
riculum Committee.

The purpose of the EPCs is to act as a
liaison between students and faculty
within a department, to represent student
views to the faculty and faculty views to
the students. They also act as a “wat-
chdog” on behalf of students in a depart
ment. EPC members are elected by stu
dent majors in the spring for the coming
academic year. Specific election pm
cedures are determined by department

' faculty. EPCs usually consist of three or

[our members.

The committees have three main areas
of responsibiity; faculty recommenda.
tions. curriculum recommendations and
extracurricular activities such as lectures
and social events. Faculty recommenda
tions can take the form of hiring recom-
mendations, contract renewal recommenr
dations or tenure recommendations,

Curriculum recommendations involve
changes or additions to the curriculum and
can include recommendations on what text
to use and what equipment should be pur-
chased. Extracurricular events are often
sponsored by EPCs alone or in conjunction
with me department. Parties with faculty
members offer an opportunity for students

“ and professors to meet in a non-class situa-

tion and for majors to meet and share

Women’s Basketball

Senior Julie Crawford has been cited as
the most valuable member of the 1982-83
women‘s basketball team.

A three-year starter, Crawford ﬁnished
her collegiate career as the number four
scorer in Grinnell history. Playing in a
total of 39 games, she tallied 505 points for
a 12.9 average.

Freshman Audrey Crawford led this
year‘s edition of the Pioneers in bout score
mg (219 points and a 12 9 average) and re-
bounding (192).

Single games highs were claimed by
Julie Crawford (25 points) and Audrey
Crawford (21 rebounds).

The most improved award went to
sophomore Judy Kintner.

Grinnell posted an overall 5-12- record

and was 3-9 in the Midwest Athletic con,
ference for Women.

 

ideas, Some parties, like the political
science department’s recent post-election
party, also encourage students to par-
ticipate in a related activity.

Each EPC elects a chairperson, and the
chairs of the EPCs form the Curriculum
Council which then elects a representative
from each division to the Curriculum Com-
mittee. The Curriculum Council is chaired
by the SGA vice-president and meets only
when an issue arises. The Curriculum
Committee is composed of the SGA vice-
president, a representative from an EPC
in each division, a faculty representative
from each division and several additional
faculty members, Recommendations
regarding curriculum changes are
directed to the Curriculum Committee,
which makes the final decision. Final
tenure decisions are made by the Ex-
ecutive Council.

Last year he faculty accused students of
forfeiting their right to participate in curs
riculum decisions by failing to appear at
Curriculum Committee meetings. This
year, however, attendance has not been a
problem. In addition to SGA Vice-
President Mark Bradshaw, me students on
the committee include Jody Hoffman as
the social science representative, Linda
Berkuw'itz representing the science divi-
sion and Jim Rabchtﬂf as the humanities
representative. The chairperson of the
Curriculum Council is Lynn Flickinger.

Members of EPCs spend as many as 15
hours a week on various committee pro-
jects. The English EPC has been working

to gauge student opinion on the buffer days
issue. The Political Science EPC has con-
centrated its attention on hiring recom-
mendations so far this semester. Biology
EPC members attend weekly faculty
meetings, arrange weekly seminars and
have written tenure recommendations for
two faculty members.

The EPCS do not receive any direct fun~
ding. SGA is one source of money for the
committees, and the departments will
sometimes share expenses for activities,

Most EPC members believe that
students under use the educational policy
committees as a resource. This results
because, in the words of one EPC member,
“Most students aren‘t afraid to contact
profs on their own." When an EPC does
have an issue to discuss with their deparb
ment, the professors are generally con-
tacted first. The faculty would then cons
tact the department chairperson, who
would contact the division chair, who
would then contact the Curriculum Com-
mittee, if a change was to be made. On the
whole EPC members have nothing but
praise for this system. Although there is
agreement that the effectiveness of the
EPC depends largely on the rapport bet-
ween the faculty and the EPC members,
most EPCs are happy with their relation-
ship with the faculty. “They’ve been very
receptive," said Dave Hoffman, a member
of the American Studies EPC. “I’ve
always felt that I've been listened to," add-
ed Dave Benjamin, a member of the
Economics EPC.
