BENZ AND CRITGHET LEAD
IN NEW STYLE OF 'ATTACK

Janssen Shows Up Well at Guard
—Waite Outstanding Star of
Contest—Score 25-22.

Ollce again the Pioneers received
the decision oi "thumbs down" when
they appeared in the local arena last
night, pitted against the cohorts oi
Waite and his hard riding cow punch-
ers. "lie game was one 01 the hardest
lought battles which has been con.
tested on the local lioor this year, the
score being tied at half time and close
throughout the entire game. The ole
fense oi the Pioneers was the strong.
est that it has been ior some tirue and
in spite of their disadvantage in weight
they kept the giant Sooner-s going at
a hot pace from whistle to whistle.
The score stood at 25 to 22 with 0k-
lahoma on the long end of the score
when the gun announced the end or
the game.

Use New Style Playi

Using a new style ot play with DC—
casional reversions to their old tarmac
tion plays. the Pioneers presented an
ottensive which was both fast and er»
tective, Critchett and Benz with three
held goals apiece were the prize Grin—
nell marksman. in spite of his crip-
pied hand Critchett seemed little both-
ered by his injury and played an ex-
cellent game both in iioor work and in
hitting the basket. Junssen’s work at
guard proved a revelation to those
who had not seen him in action he-
tore.. The big guard was a power on
defensive work who showed himself
capable oi taking care oi the mam»
moth cow hoys rn flue style. His pas-
ses were always last and straight, a
valuable quality for stationary guard.
Smith at the other guard position was
slso.a match ior his huge antagonists
and mixed his sterling guard work
with occasional dying raids down the
side lines which kept the Sooner de-
tense in a constant torment.

Waite Sooner Star

Waite, the lanky sooner center,
loomed up as the pivot man around
which all the play of the Oklahoma
aggregation was centercd. Playing as
though he enjoyed it, the Oklahoma
star slipped in four held baskets and
nine out oi eleven free throws tor a
total of seventeen points. one oi his
shots, at one hand book from the side
line while travelling at tull speed. was
one or the clever-est shots ever seen on
the local floor Tyler also put up a
good game tor the visitors.

Waite opened the scoring with two
tree throws but the score was tied sono
After when Benz dropped in two more
or the same variety. Waite then
counted again by batting the ball
through the hoop truth a toss up. Ty-
ler followed Waiie's example by sink—
ing a clean one from close in. Two
more tree throws by Benz and Waite
put the score at s to 4 in layer or the
visitors. At this point the Pioneers
enginecred a spirited rally when Crite
chett counted twice on close shots and
Smith looed one in from the side line,
putting the count at 10 to i with the
Pioneers on top. Two more irce
tosses and a ﬁeld goal by the redoubt-
able Waite and a goal by Benz clos—
ed the scoring of the bolt with the
score board showing a 12 to 12 tie.

‘ Breaks Evan

Waite and Benz continued their
scoring streak which they had luau»
gurated in the ﬁrst halt when they
came back for the second period, both
men making a held goal and two free
throws while their team mates went
scoreless. The Sooners then got away
to a 2b to 16 lead when Waite scored
again and was soon tollowcd by
Morse. With only a low minutes lett

Thursday Morning Address

"A ﬁxed proportional payment ul‘l-

thought expressed by Bishop Homeri

In this way God taught the people
two things, that he was the owner of
all, and that each individual should
contribute or his earthly substance to
Him, thereby establishing the practice
of steu'dl‘dslli .

"As a Christian you have to go be—
yond the Jew because at the addition—

speaker. “Stewardship includes all,
if you are a Christian.”

Close guarding by both teams kept
the play toward the center of the door
with the' result that the basket shoot—

attempts. Cowell, last year’s all-
Valley guard, showed up especially
lucky in this style oi play and it was

from the ﬁeld. Smith pcriormed in ,
