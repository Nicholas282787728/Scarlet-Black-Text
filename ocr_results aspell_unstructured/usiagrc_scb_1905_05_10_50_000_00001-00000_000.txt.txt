SIMPSON VS GRINNELL.

The Grinnell team took the second
game on its trip by defeating Simpson
6—1 Saturday anal-noon at Indianola.
The game, although not. as well played
as the contest Friday with Amos, nev-
ertheless, was exciting throughout.

Captain Baird did the twirling [or

 

his team willie Smithson acted in the
same capacity for Gl'innell. IL was it
pitchers battle irom the beginning to
the end with odds slightly in favor of
the latter. It will be remembered
that Smithson pitched the game Fri-
day against Ames and considering
this fact. his work in striking out
eleven men and allowing only four hits
is highly commendable. Baird pitched
steady ballot alliimcs and quit the
game with a record or eight strike-Outs
and having allowed only live hits.

Grilinell Was ﬁrst at bat and secured
tally number 0 n e before retiring.
Simpson, by securing two or her tour
hits in the ﬁrst inning, managed to
get her only score. By opportune lilt-
ting and assisted at times by ragged
play on the partoi' the lnethodists,
the scarlet and black gradually added
to the score until the total of six was
reached. At only one time during
the game did Simpson have a chance
to onset the score other opponents.
\Vith the bases full and only one man
out, by iast work on the part or Grin-
hell's inﬁeld, the men on third and
second were caught napping anathe
side retired.

The game was watched by it full
sized crowd which at all times demon
strated its intense desire for a victory
[or the home team.

ACADEMY WiNs THE DAY.

Preps Take 47 Points and First Place at
the Home Field Meelisome
Records Broken.

The Home Meet held on Wili‘d Field
last Saturday proved to be one of the
lnosL satisfactory athletic events in
the cczlrlet and blacks recent his-
tory. Noless than Six home records
were broken and those in the weight
events were hterallysmasned, being
raised for the ﬁrst time to a level
which compares iavorably with that
of other lending institutions of the
middle west. Grinnell seems at last
to have attained the excellence on
the weight events which in former
years she has been so notorious in

lacking.

The Academy contestants carried
away ﬁrst honors even more easily
than had been prophesied and the
seniors barely woii the second from
the sophomores. As ior years past
the classes whose emblems bore the
ill-starred even years had to be con-
tent With the lust places. Glow was
the best individual performer of the
day with three ﬁrsts, a second and a
third place to his credit. McKeaue
was a close second with three ﬁrsts.

The day was cloudy and a moderate
wind blew down the stretch which
Somewhat bettered the records in the
shorter events but handicapped the
distance runners, The olﬁcials proved
effective throughout and as aresult
the crowd was kept waiting butlittle.

The 120 yard hurdles was the ﬁrst
event run. OH and resulted in what
was perhaps the best record of the
day, Clow winning easily in misco-
onds, Spencer tailing second place
from Moir.

Preliminaries were run in the longer
hurdles and in the ﬁnals Moll”, Peck
and Spencer ran neck and neck for
second position. Spencer was disquali-
ﬁed and all three places went to the
nndcrciass men. Tho dashes proved
easy ior Hall who set a new record in
the 100 yard of 10 15) seconds. The
quarter proved the closest race or the
day. lleiiaan was too strong iorhis
opponents. Jaqua trailed him close-
ly and a heart hreai-ingiinish between
Trigg and Dawson decided the
third in favor of thelatter. MCIlrath
took the mile and came ,out with
strength enough to lead the half
lnilers in. H. few moments later. Mar-
vin had no trouble in landing the
long event but could not get inside
or an eleven minute gait.

Mclieaiie and Green [or the acade-
my were invincible in the weight
events. The [Ornier’s mark of 118 ft.
8; inches in the discus indicates that
Grinnell is in the running for ﬁrst
place aLXSLate Meet and the hammer
record is 20 (L, better than previous
wearers of the Scarlet and black have
been able to attain to. The ﬁeld
records were uniformly mediocre but

great improvement in the jumps can

be expected ili coming contests. All
in all Griliiiell seems exceptionally
strong in the weights and hurdles, has
great possibilities the sprints and
mile, and possible point winners in
theiumps and other rims. The mile
relay team should be heard from also.
