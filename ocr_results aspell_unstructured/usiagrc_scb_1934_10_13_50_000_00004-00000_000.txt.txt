Nearly 85 Per Cent of Crinnell Men
Participating in Supervised Athletics

Large Majority of Students
Adopt Use of Informal
Physical Training

Nearly 19!) of the 330 men enrolled
at: crinnell will be participating in
some kind oi supervised sport by the
end of next week, director oi ath—
letics John Truesdale revealed yester—
day.

"This does not include the men
who are taking part in thc intramural
speedball competition,” he pointed
out. The latter will probably approach
90 in total, as each team is composed
oi 10 men and it is a general prac.
ticc to substitute quite freely. If
this number is included. it can be
said that nearly as per cent of the
men at Grinnell are engaged in some
form oi iniormal physical training.

Participation in the various sports is
as follows: football 55, cross country

Recent Educational Survey
Uncovers Surprising Facts

New York, N. Y. (NSFA)— To deter-
mine the ouality oi the mind trained
by a sour—year college course the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advance-
ment of Teaching spent six years
studying educational institutions in
Pennsylvania.

Afew findings resulting irom in-
telligence, culture and general
knowledge tests given to thous~
ands oi students are: do per
cent of all seniors in six colleges
ranked below the average ireshman
in the general culture tests. Average
college sophomores know the mean»
ing of 55 out of 100 commonly used
words. Two more year-s of exposure
enabled the same student to recog-
nize 62 in 100. Average intelligence
oi seniors in four high schools was
above that of all college sophomore
candidates for an education degree.

The group responsible ior this dis~
illusioning investigation points to the
credit system as one oi the reasons
for uneducation of college students,
They ieei that too much emphasis is
placed on grades as barometcrs oi
knowledge culture and intelligence.
