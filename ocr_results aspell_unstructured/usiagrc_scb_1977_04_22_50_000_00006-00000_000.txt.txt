Mourns death of hero

by Pat Editinnds

So no one asked, “Who was
George Frazier?" (Lunch, by the
way, was absolutely delightful, it
not downright hardy, at Muller’s
Fine Food in Dickeyville,
Wisconsin, a couple of miles past
the border after the bridge that
appears to be constructed of green
pipecleaners, yet miraculously
still spans the Mississippi.)

When i learned that George
Frazier had died I came to un-
derstand why Danny Joy nearly
lost his mind when Picasso moved
on two years earlier. Danny is an
artist and Picasso was his hero.
Frazier was mine.

Having been on the road, away
from the east for a year, one of the
first things I did when I got back
was to search the paper for
Frazier’s column; and then, not
ﬁnding it, headed straight for a bar
where a headline editor I knew
hung out between volleyball games
and stories,

“Is George Frazier dead?” I
asked, starting as I always have
with the worst assumption so as to
be overjoyed when proved wrong.

“Yes, he died some time ago,"
answered my iriend a little too
quickly lor me, “He had cancer,
you know.”

Well, I didn't know. I didn't
know that George Frazier who
chainsmoked constantly could
ever die. Not George, he was above
that sort of thing.

When i first began to read
Frazier, I pictured him to be about
35 years old. He was so avant-
garde, so hip, so into and up on
everything, he had to be young. He
seemed to know exactly what was
going on, he saw social trends, he
commented about the revolution,
he wrote about music, especially
jazz, the crazy afterrhours life,
baseball and the White House. He
must have smoked pot, too, I was
quite sure.

Sometimes his columns were
highly structured affairs, then at
other times the words would flow
and roll along like an air glider on a
nearly breathless day, and then
another time he would experiment
and write with only three or fom
word sentences. Once he composed
an entire column out [If a series of
freely associated beautiful words.
He was wild.

At last I saw him on T.V. one
night. He’d been commissioned to
do a three minute commentary
twice a week by one oi the Boston
stations, The preconceptions
vanished. He was George Frazier,
no youngster, no aging hippie. but
rather an upright old man with
white hair. dressed in impeccably
spare and tailored perfection. A
cross between Harry Reasoner and
George Burns he was, and like
them he always caught me off
guard.

He couldn't resist Commenting in
his column about the social faux
pas perpetrated by some or the
nouveau riche. This got to people
who would admit that Frazier
could write yet nevertheless
refused to acknowledge him
because he could be such a snub.

One could get hooked on Frazier
columns, though,:because he was
so sharp and cutting in his
criticism, He would report with
great delight the scene that
followed when the maitre d' at the
Ritz Carlton refused to seat those
gentlemen who showed up to dine
in turtlenecks or those women who
appeared in pants. This was over
five years ago, you remember,
when turtlenecks were just
breaking into formal wear and the
only women who wore pants on the
street or after five were, perhaps,
hllssies.

A word from Frazier could make
or break a writer. A couple of times
a month he would report on the
writing in current magazines like

Ramparts, or Rolling Stone or
some far off-beat publication, He’d
send his readers out to savor that
which he found to be excellent.

I'll never forget when a young
acquaintance of Danny Joy‘s and
mine went into euphory after
Frazier cited him as a young
writer to watch in one of his
columns.

My headline editor friend who
had met Frazier in the newsroom
many times and knew his son well,
sensed that I was a Frazier
follower. And then, perhaps,
feeling the inexpressible grief that
had over come me as I repeated
again and again, “I can't believe
he’s dead, I can’t believe he’s
dead,“ offered to tell me Frazier’s
last words, which were spoken to
the attending nurse as he lay in a
Massachusetts hospital
overlooking Harvard’s Football
Stadium.

“Oh, don’t mind me,” Frazier
sai “I'm just here for the Har-
vardrYale Game."

1 was saddest, I told my iriend,
because I should never get to see
George Frazier in the flesh. I told
him that it had long been one of the
great dreams of my life to see
George Frazier in person.

My friend turned to me then and
said, “He would have loved to meet
you, He would have liked that. He
was really a very lonely man.
Sometimes he would come down to
the composing room late at night
just to talk with the printers or the
news reporters on the swing shift.
He helped them, he was that kind
of guy. Modest and gentle too.”

It was a long time before I came
out of mourning for George Frazier
and I don’t suppose i shall ever get
over his departure, but I do know
that I have never since and never
will again hesitate to seek out those
that are my heroes, to touch their
sleeves, to learn from them and to
worship at their shrine.

Amarcord

this week’s flicks

by Peter Jaroﬂ

If you can’t stand (or can’t read)
subtitles, this just isn't your
month. This weekend is the second
of three April weekends
highlighted by an excellent foreign
film Last week was The 400 Blows,
next week is The Spider's Strategy,
and this weekend brings us
Federico Fellini's Amarcord (1974,
105 minutes),

Prior to the filming of Amarcord,
Fellini’s reputation as one of the
world’s most acclaimed directors
had takena beating, thanks largely
to the sellrindulgent excesses of
films like Satyricon and Roma.
Amarcord signaled the return of
Fellini to the ranks of the great
filmmakers.

Amnrcnrd is the story or a small
Italian town at the beginning of the
fascist era. The film is a patchwork
of vignettes and anecdotes, some
funny, some crazy, others poignant
and bittersweet. Fellini trains his
lens on the town’s various
characters and their little
escapades: the ongoing struggle
between the teachers and their
rascally charges, the local sex-
symbol and her suitors, Uncle Tee
(“1 want a \vomanlt”), and the

efforts of the ﬂedgling anti-fascist
group.

Other images stick in the mind
as well: the entire town rowing out
to sea to catch a glimpse of a
famous ocean-liner as it passes in
me night, a gang of boys pan-
tomiming musicians in front Eli a
derelict hotel, a dream of a fan
tastic harem. Amarcord is that
seldom-found mixture of good
iilmmaking and good storytellin
There are not many films I co
recommend more highly. Go see

A Bigger Splash (1973, 127
minutes) is the Grinnell College
Gay Community’s film this yea
The film is directed by Davl
Hockney, who was in the vanguard
of the British “pop" scene in the
1960’s, it deals with Hockney’s
inability to continue with his work
after his lover (Peter Schlesinger)
walks out on him. Hockney filmed
A Bigger Splash in London,
Geneva, California and New York.
Hockney and his work have a cadre
of admirers, although Vincent
Canby oi the New York Times isn’t
one of them. He called the film
“unforgivably solemn,H
“fragmented and sellrconscious,"
and “small and drab.” ‘
