The call for change comes a year after an incident on campus,
in which a female student-athlete was allegedly assaulted by
two Iowa football players. While the University President
said that administrative action was appropriate, the school
will look to change the ofﬁcial policy, which has come under
attack for being insensitive to victims’ needs.

~ several McDonald’s franchises have taken the popular
doublercheeseburger off of the dollar menu in response to
rising food prices. The sandwich, which consists of two beef
patties, two slices of cheese, pickles, onions, mustard and
ketchup between a sesame seed bun, has not seen a nations
wide price drop, but some franchisees have made rogue de-
cisions in order to minimize potential loss. According to an
unidentified worker at the McDonald’s in Grinnell, the price
ofa double cheeseburger in Grinnell is $1.70 with tax.

Pioneer Web launches “G-Space” feature

BY CHARES NETZER

Along with hard drives, email accounts and the occasional
ﬂash drive, students at Grinnell havc yet another place to store
gigabyte upon gigabyte of files,

GESpace is a new feature for Pioneer Web, the longtime Iii-
rcrner client tor rhe professors and students or
Grinnell. Late last war, GrSpace cnteied into
a pilot phase, during which approximately 70
students tested and critiqued it, The onlinc

over the summer.

orspace acts as a remote srorage GtSiIarearwunt”

and backup space that can hold up to four gi-
gabytes of data per student. Although a simi-
lar service was already available to professors
for their classes, “students needed a similar
service,” said Wayne Twitchell, head of Pine
ncer Web services.

According to Twitchcll, G-space will be more open-ended
and accessible than the old faculty Pioneer Web storage. "It’s four
gigs for you, manage it any way you feel like,”Twitchel.l said. “If
you can get to the web, you can get your G»Space accounlr"

G-Spacc itself behaves much like an external hard drive or
a thumb drive. Users can set programs like Microsoft Office to
automatically back up ﬁles or use the space to share MP3s in a

manner similar to that ofthe popular FTP servers on campus.

There are a few roadblocks to sharing ﬁles. “Mac does it just
ﬁne, Linux does itjust ﬁne,"'l'wirchel.l said. “but Windows has to
be a bonehead.”

According to Twitchcll, a program called thhos. fully avaik
able to students,fixes the problem.

Students, for the most part, remain bafﬂed
by G-space. “I really don't know what it is,"
Akshay Bajaj '12 said, a scntnncnt mirrored
by the vast majority of interviewed students.

Tom Elliot’l 1, a technical consultant, also
knew very little. “I know it’s a personal stor—
age system—a way to store files on Pioneer
Web," he said, “Although tech consultants
submit projects through G-Space, 1 have not
used it for classes,"

Twitchell, who spearheaded what he calls
the “subversive upgrade" to GESpace, anticipates its success. ”[G—
space] is the shiny new toy," he said, “and we know from other
schools its use will ramp up." Ifstudents feel confused by the new
service, a set of instructional videos is available to them online.

According Twitchell, he is not ﬁnished tweaking the system
and spreading the word. “I’d love to be able to get a wiki thing set
up and make Grspace generally more transparent," he said.

 

Fines

not quote unquote ‘had
our backs', then we would
not have gotten the fine reduced."

Many students said they feel that the Cur
rent system does not work in accordance with
the colleges policy otselfrgovernance. It was
this discrepancy that became a focus for Stur
dent Affairs

Members of Student Affairs said they
hope to bring the system in linewith whatstu-
dents deem fair. “Some of the issues were how
punitive the old system was, that it wasn’t an
educational process,” Assistant Dean of Stu-

fram p. 1

dents and Director of Residence Lift: Sheree
Andrews said. “It wasn't equitable.Those who
could pay did,while others struggled."

Greene and Hinds-Brush have taken over
Residential Life’s damage policy while Anr
drews is on administrative leaver

No deﬁnitive new policy has been an
nounced a month into the first semester.
Hinds-Brush said the issue will be touched
upon in this year’s first Residential Life Com
mittee meeting. “After we have a meeting and
get student input, we will have a better idea of
what the changes will be,"HindseBrush said.
