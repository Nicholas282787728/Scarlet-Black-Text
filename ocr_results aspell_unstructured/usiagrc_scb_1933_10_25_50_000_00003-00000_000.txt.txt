It is rumored that Captain “Corny"
Conrad Collin, of the Creighton unis
versity football team, which is
scheduled to play here Friday night,
is in line for a'bascbail job with the
Detroit Tiger , of the American
Leawlle. Collin spent his summer
we ung in a Detroit automobile face

, and found time to work out
with the Tigers nearly eve , ~ day, Dee
troit authorities are said to regard
Collin as one of the most promising
fi basomcn tiiey have seen in
several years.

been seen in action with tiie Bl ic-

inning something to say about his
taking the . . Neicriliclcss, Col~
lin was given n second team till-'
American ha. (ethfill rating last
year, and was being lined up for
all merican football rating until
his injury this year. He is the
greatest nllrround athlete in the
history of the university, according
to Creighton, and is the first man
to receive the captainship of both
the football and basketball teams.

The Missouri Valley now has an-
other athiete who demands some na-
tional attention. That is My Ubl, for
mer University of Minnesota star,
who transferred recently to Drake.
In a scrimmage against the varsity,
My Ubl, playing with the props,
scored a touchdown through the cam
ter of the line on his first play. He
plays the quarterback position, and
is a triple—threat man. Uhl was a
Big Ten star in 1932 and was headed
for additional fame at Minnesota last
year until a chest injury put him out
of the game in a preseason prac-
tice session. This injury put My on
the verge of death for several days.
and he was given national publicity.
He now has a silver piece in his ster-
num, and plans to continue his foot-
baii career. The reason for his trans
for to Drake was prompted by the
fact that the Minnesota coaches
would not use him. He is a friend of
Evan 0. Williams, assistant Drake
football coach, who was his mentor
at his high school in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

Campus Opinion

i
.HJ

Are you in favor of dismissing
school on Friday following Thanks-
giving?

George Marker "Friday off should
stimulate the spirit of Thanksgiving
among us.”

Tom Gordon: “I’ll bet some of the
freshmen would like to take a trip
home. , so would we."

Robert Evans: "After Thanksgiw
ing 1 much prefer to sleep at home
than in classes.”

Marian Thedc: “We should have
the extra day. By Thanksgiving we
all need a vacation to keep us going
until Christmas."

Margaret Moray: “It would not
only benefit the students but think
of the money the school would save
on Thanksgiving dinners."

Mary June Miller: “Whether we
can go home or not we need that
time for relaxation.”

Helen Luke, "We need a short
vacation before Christmas as it is
too long a stretch from September
to December.”

being poetesscs. Miss Hassell‘s work
has been accepted in Commonweal
and Sonnet Sequences; and her poem
“VVamilig” has the touch of an
imagist with its colorful pertinacy.

Miss Law's “Love Baggal‘" seems
the best for description. It is ex-

Margaret Kimball is short, sweet,

1 keep coming back
to that word "balanced”
on the back of the
Chesterfield package

0U often hear the word balance—
something is out of balance—lop-
heavy, not on an "even keel.”
What you read,"Cbestei-ﬁeld Cigarettes
are £1 balanced blend,” means that the right
amounts of the right kinds of tobacco are
welded together; that is, home-grown to-
baccos, the right kind, the right quantity—
are blended and cross-blended with tobac-
cos from Turkey and Greece.
When lbese tobaccos are balanced one
against the other, lben you have a mild

cigarette.

When they are in balance, then you have
a better-lasting cigarette.

May we ark you to read

again the statement
on the back of the Chesterﬁeld package?

May we ask you to try Chesterﬁeld?
