0 Empty Place.

The retirement of ally professor from a
college faculty is in many ways like the
going down of a great tree in a forest. After
forty years of teaching on the Grinnell cam—
pus, the retirement of William James Rusk,
Myra Steele professor of mathematics and
astronomy, will indeed leave in empty place
against our sky.

This fact is especially true, because Mr.
Rusk is more than a fine mathematician and
able teacher; he is known as a poet of note
and a genial gentleman, as well.

For all of these things, we pay tribute to

him, realizing now that his place will be
hzlrd to fill, not simply because the work of
his department has become increasineg
important in waltime, but because of the
man himself. We will miss him for what he
is and for what he has done.

0 Concert Series.

Among other things in ollr retrospect, the
lecture and concert series at Grinnell college
this past year is one thing we can look back
at only with pride and satisfaction

Such outstanding names as Albert Spaldn
ing, Pierre van Paassell, Egon Petri, Bishop
G. B Oxnam, the Siberian Singers, and the
Chekhov Players in themselves lured our
interest from the beginning, and then when
our brightest hopes were realized in nearly
every instance by the actual appearance of
these people, we knew indeed that brighter
days had dawned for Grinnell, The Good
Olde Days related with nostalgia by our
pioneer fathers, when Grinnell nourished
culture and ideas, had, we found, not entirely
laded into a dim memory,

Even when war activities necessitated the
non-appearance of Alexander Woollcott and
Ezio Pinza, who had originally been included
in the series, we did not feel too bitterly
frustrated, for they were replaced by the
Indian lecurer, Syud Hossain and, this week,
the justly famed singer, Dusolina Giannini.
Now we are content to face the future un—
perturbed, knowing that once again Grinnell
can hold its head high and point with justi-
fiable pride to a year of distinguished pres
sentationsi

 

Students Ignore Ciannini’s Concert

manner, displaying good vocal
quality, range, and well handled
dynamics.

Her sixth number, the soft and
sustained ”Cara, Cara c1 mio Bamn
bin" by Guarnieri, is very dif
cult to sing and was the piece in
which she showed the most beau—
tiful tone quality. “In Mezzo dl
Mar," a folk song arranged by
Geni Sande“), ranked closely with
this tamer in quality and fullness
of tone, and Miss Giannini suc-
ceeded in expressing its joyous
mood. Also very well sung was
Frank La Forge's “Before ilie
C‘nlcifix,” in which could be per-
ceived a note of sadness; perhaps

‘awe climaxed by a tragic finish.

Special recognition should go to
Mr. Edwin McArthur, who ac-
companied Miss Gianni superbly.
Rapidly gaining prominence as a
great conductor, McArt’hur was
the only accompanist of Kirsten
Flagstad during her stay in this
