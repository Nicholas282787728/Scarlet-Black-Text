Prehistoric inn —has he at (est
been traced to lils lair? Count By on
Khun lie Prorok. r cheologist, thinks
so. and with his illustrated lecture at
lthe Con egational church, Thu sday
night. he gave evidence that in north
ern Africa he has discovered the
dwelling place of our original anccs-
tors,

In future expeditions to the ter '
tory about the sites of ancient Ca —
thage, Utica. and the Sahara desert,
the twenty line year’old'Polish count
hopes to -add to his already famous
discoveries, the remains of the first
race of man. At present he has found
relics of the flint age and Neolithic
period, some of which are thought to
date back 150,000 to 200,000 years.

Benin. ~ Covered by Sands

Deep under the sands of Africa,
Count De Prorok found the remains
of civilizations dating back many
thousands of years B. C. Egyptians,
Venetians and Carthaginians are
among the peoples uncrse bodies and
relies have been unearthed. Slabs of
rock inscribed with hieroglyphics and
tombs in which the skeletons are
adorned with precious trinkets and
ornaments have addcd zest to the ex-
cavations.

One of the first of the discoveries
which Count De Proi-ok showed on
the screen was the sacrificial urns
in an old temple. Over 5,000 of chese

small urns were found and all con-g

tained the bodies of children who had
been sacrificed. l'lis pictures showed
hits of bones which composed the tiny

skeletons of children ranging in age -

at death from b -th to twelve years,
Finds Cities Under Serb

Under the sea off the northern
coast of Africa was found the remains
of another ancient city and with div-
Jng equipment and at the risk of life
many old vases and fine mosaics were
brought up. He told of the perilous
life led by Greek sponge (livers, most
of whom have diver's paralysis at the
age of forty. Great pressure causes
their legs to grow numb and although
the men can walk under water they
can hardly crawl on land. About
twenty 9 El year are drowned or
suffocated in diving accidents.

In one part of north Africa his ex-
pedition drove over the smooth sur-
faced salt lakes which are perfectly
erd in the dry season but covered
with two or three feet of Water in the
winter. When the salt first begins to
soften it is very treacherous and it is
said there, that an entire caravan of
gold was once. swallowed up in the
lake of salt.

Crosses S-‘Illarn
The Counﬂs most daring explora-

tion was his thousand mile trip in tho:

tor cars across the Sahara, to the
Touraegs’ country in [he Haggar res
gion. which is as large its the United
States. In specially built cars mount-
ed with machine guns his party set
out. following camel parties which
had been sent ahead to leave supplies
at various points.

Following trails lined with the
bones orcamels and the tombs of fate
ed travelers they finally reached the
land of the Touraegs, a myste 'uus
race of giant men Who have probably
massacred more while men than any
other people, By olfering then) tons
of sugar Prorok was allowed to take
moving Pictures.

)Ien Weill Veils

The Touraegs have many curious
customs. One is that all men must
veil their faces at the age of eleven
and never show them again. The wo-
men are allowed to go unveiled, how—
ever, All descendancy is biased on the
female side, the man taking the Woe
man’s name at marriage.

In the Hoggar region he discovered
and excavated the legendary tomb by
Queen TaJHitan from whom all Tour-
aegs are said to be descended His
moving picture showed the removal
of her skeleton from the tomb, hone
by bone, On her arms were seen

(Continued on Pole I)

Not to be outdone by the war dance
of the Touraegs, the Clark hall boys
showed Count do Prorok an exhibition
of the Charleston, Friday night after
his lecture. The count thoroughly one
joyefl it, but said. "It isn't possible."
Then he added, ”a woman could never
go through those colitortions."

Tfuct the Count seemed to be
rather doubtful as to the general abilr
ity of women. He was tlulrttounded
when first told that women get high-
or grades than men, but then ex—
plained it by saying, “Oh yes, I Sec,
You men all so out for football,” That
it woman should be in a class seemed
to him a curious thing. “How can
You get anything (long with women
around?" he questioned.
Count is Modest

Perhaps the counts dislike for .007
education was due to his extreme
modesty for he remarked that he
would not face an audience in a light-
ed room. »

The Count, said he was one of the
timers who held watches on the Olymr
pic race in which hlorgan Taylor
broke a world's record, and he was
surprised to hear that Taylor came
from Crinuell. De Prorok caught Tay-
lor at tworfii‘tbs of a second faster-
than did the other timers.

Contrary to his Dictuie which

Charleston Vies With The Dance
Of Touraegs States Count Prorok

showed him smoking a cigarette, the
Count cxprcsscd‘ a great aversion for
them. He said, ”They happened to
take my picture when I was smoking‘
the only cigarette I had smoked for
several years and they have used iL
ever since. I hate cigarettes and
.smoke‘a pipe. We almost had a law-
5 t over that picture.“
IDueSn’t Like Prohibition

On every subject that was broached
Count do Prorok showed a willingness
to talk, One thing he could not get
over was prohibition. He said he was
strongly opposed to it and remarked
that he had the best Wine cellar in
‘Fl'auce.

He strongly recommended his work
as a life job because of its fascination.
However, he stated that one had to be
absolutely self supporting to enter it
for all was paid out and little came
in. He made the remark that he had
spent over two million dollars of his
private fortune since he had entered.
on his explorations.

Count de Prorok seemed to enjoy
the unusual manner in which he was
received in the dormitories. He was
surrounded by a host of men, fascin-
ated by his clev. - conversation. from
the time he arr ed until he left at
three o'clock yesterday mcl'ninV- for
St, Louis.

' The strong Oklahoma team remains
on top in the race for Valley suprem-
acy with five victories and no defeats.
This past week the Sooners heat Kan-
sas in a game that was considered by
some to he a crucial contest, and last
night the Southerners added to their
percentage by taking the Pioneers in
to camp. This outfit is speedily huiltb
ing up its prestige and from all indi-
cations is the best earlyrseason bet

for the Valley honors.

Nebraska is also in the prize money
h'ut she has played only one confer—
cnce game and as yet her strength is
practically unknown. The Huskers do
not have the fast scoring team of
former years and their success this

Washington, the “wonder” team of

the inlltdins team. Lecrone played a
great defensive game, consistently

putting the Red and. white goal out of
danger. McBride, speedy forward,

For the first time in history the
Pioneer basketball team will be host
to an aggregation representing the
Oklahoma Aggies when they meet to-
night on the Scarlet and Black court.
Although the Aggies are new in the
Valley conference, they have proven’
thus 'lilr to he a formidable quintet

The boys from stillwater have scor.
cd three wins against their valley
opponents, being downed only by the
Washington Bear in a hard and
closely fought battle. The Aggies
have victories over Missouri, heating
the Bengals 31 to 20, and Drake, wal-
loping the Bulldogs twice. At Still—
water they trimmed Buelier's crew
by the score of 3: to 20 and last night
at Des Moincs nosed out the Blue and
White by a 2i to 23 score. A basket
by Elder in the last fifteen seconds al-
lowed coach Maulhetsch's quintet to
triumph.

' Play Purdue style

The Aggies play the old Purdue
style of play of basketball. This style
of play calls for a four man offensive
and a big rangy center is the apex
around which they work. He hits
for a spot down the middle of the of-
fensive court and the two forwards
break down their sides into deep of-
fe ive territory

'lllc success of mi; style or {flay is

center. and the Aggies have just that.

high scorer in the Southwestern Com

ket. Hall, Peerx, and Elder are all
over six feet and they employ an over
head passing attack which gives them
a decided advantage over their small-
er apponents. 1n Connor, the Aggies
have one of the best defensive guards
in the Valley.

Pioneers 'e Ire Up

After outrnlaying the powerful
Sooners throughout most of the game
last night and then being downed by
a deluge of baskets in the last ,three
minutes of play. the drinnell cagers
are in an angry mood. Eour defeats
at the hands of Valley opponents have
roused the Scarlet and Black has-
keteers and they are anxious for a
taste of victory.

If ii‘oran, Davis, and Doffing are
playing up to their usual standard
and are able to hit the loop with reg—
ularity and keep their defense tighten—
ed, the Pioneers will have an excel~
lent chance to chalk up their first
Valley win in tonight’s contest.
