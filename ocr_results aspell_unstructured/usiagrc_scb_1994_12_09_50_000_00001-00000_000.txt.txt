said Athcrton. speaking of the sur-

responding. “I got married!" Osbom,

Osborn). who is also a senior.

Several juniors. including Rachel
Farris ‘96. are engaged to be married
after they graduate. Farris is engaged
to her boyfriend of more than two
years. Michael Mattison. a graduate
student at lowa State University. in
Ames. Thinking it appropriate since
they met on stage. Mattison proposed
to Farris during curtain calls of the
Mcdrcval Cycle Plays. in which Farris
was acting. “I was in shock." said
Farris. “I was ready to exit. and I
turned around. and there he was. II was

In what is widely agreed upon as one
of the most romantic proposals ever
seen, Mattison presented Fam‘s with a
ring. and publicly declared his love for
her in front of a packed house in Rob»
ens Theater. Said Farris later. “I ale
ways pictured myself in a park with
nice clothes. just the two of us. not in
front of everyone. wearing long johns
and an ugly dress.” Remarked Brett
Stinski ‘95 upon hearing of the en
gagement, “Man. I went [to the play]

The list of students who are eir

at press time. too large to print, and
is only getting larger. Some blame
the unusually long autumn. saying
that it gave people a chance to be
together outside longer. and that it
was more like the early spring. thus
sparking romance. Whatever the
cause. love is in the air. Congratula-
tions to all ofthosc afﬂicted with the
