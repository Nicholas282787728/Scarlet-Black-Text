A W‘ISE DECISION‘

The leeellt luliug by the Council of House
Presidents eliminating the election reqnilement
which made it necessary for a candidate fol
house president to get tuo- thirds of the votes
before being declared elected, was undoubtedly
one of the W] est moves tliilt the Council has
nldde this year

Those acquainted with lhe election. in tho
dormitories inst year iecdll thllt two halls ho-
oulne so deadlocked that in one case a decision
was reached only after both sides became so
worn out us to be indifferent to the result,
while in the other it was necessary to \l’i’liVL
the rule ill order to secure flu election.

Such things as these can not contlillute in
the unity of any hull, and in seeking to pi‘0\ ellt
ii recurrence of such it state, the Count-ii of
House Plesldcnts has indeed shown idle Judg-
ment,

LET THERE BE LIGHT
(Syracuse Daily Orange)

seizure by the senate lobby committee of tele-
graphic correspondence of many of the East's larger
companies has caused considerable criticism. All
telegrams of specified companies and individuals
between certain dates, wcre secured from telegraph
companies by the committee to further its work.

The cry was raised that this action violated the
fourth amendment, that it is “infamy, pressure, and
intimidation." The firms whose correspondence wes-
subpoenaed are claimed to be largely anti-New Deal.

However true this may be. there is some justifica-
tion for the action. Lobbying has often bccn decried
as one of the most serious threats to intelligent
government. Many Congressmen hcvc bccn crilia
claed for acting only to secure votes and even at
times for being unduly influenced by outside prcs-
sure. Were it alleviated, government would une
doubledly be cleaner, more intelligent, and more
sincere.

The lobby committee’s work has been constantly
blocked by weight brought by larger corporations.
Correspondence allegedly was seized in an effort to
bring light on their practices.

THE ACADEMIC TRAGEDY
(Daily Northwesleinl

It doesn't take Ule discerning student long to
realize the'fallabiiity cf the professoiicl. Nevcr-
theless, there are certain foibles of the [acuity to
which the intelligent student can never quite recoil-
cile himself.

One 0[ those foibles is the hackhlting. lhc pelly
jealousics, lhc my-colleuguc-is-un-nss attitude that
is rampant interdepartmentsliy and less rampant,
but more vicious, wifluu the various departments
themselves.

The acquisiuon of knowlcdge does not by any
mccn imply a corresponding acquisition of amia-
bllify. Neveltheiess, students are justified in
expecling c degree of stability in men who ostensibly,
at leaf, ui-c devoting their livcs to study and from
whom we have listened to so many haraugiles about
that unbalanced. screeching layman.

Listening to {acuity men run down their col-
leagues in private conversation is bail enough, but
what is even worse is the classroom practice of
not-Luo-subtle molversalion. It is a rare moment
in a student’s life whcn, he hears a professor refcr
to c colleague for substantiation of correlation. in.
slcad one finds the sorry Sight of menwften in
the same fieldiunziwale of their colleague's point
of view oi if aware, hot on the trail of picayuuish
fault finding and vilupei-alicu

After a celtain amount of this meaningless disA
sension, lhe student feels like cuntioniug the profes-
sol'izit with a soothing, “Take it easy, boys!" And
insofar as the student body suffers by an incom-
plelc and less infegi-nted presentation of material,
it has a right to protect against what would other-
wise bc a personal matter.

A comradely attitude—lo put it miidiyiwonld
be more in accord with the aims cf scholarship and
pedagogy, The disappearance of the community
of scholars is lamentable.

DUPING THE PUBLIC
(Syracuse Daily Orange]

Hair brailled schemes and wild ideas still catch
the fancy of adventurous souls ready to believe any-
thing thrust in front of them which promises to
bring in big money quickly. In pita of stale and
federal laws restricting the sale of fraudulent "get—
l'ioh»quick" securities, a certain number of security
dealers will continue their practices as long as peer
pie are wi g to be duped, as Prof. sccphcn P
Toadvine pointed out at Tuesday‘s forum.

State legislation was instituted under two gen-
eral classifications in 1923. Pennsylvania i-epi-c»
senled one lype, rcquiring c license to sell securities!
The chief objection to this plan was the stamp of
government approval which was assumed if a license
was issued. Regulations were so strict that many
reliable comnnies were stifled on technical diffi-
cullies,

New York state had another typical ruling- i-c-
quiring publication of basic information concerning
security offerings, lujunclivs power was granted
the state’s attorney's office by fhe law.

Lack of jurisdiction in scpai-alc states made
the laws themselves ineffective. Sales across state
and international borders such as Canada and
Mexico, to avoid the jurisdiction of any one state,
was comparatively simple. Necessity of all alir
inclusive federal law was crystallized when the
federal securities act was passed in 1933.

Having three main provisions, lust of regis-
tering information, setting up liability for those
who lie about their securilics and giving injullctive
power to the federal government, the act was an
excellent start in the direction of supprcssing {mud-
ulent security offerings. It was soon realized that
the act was not alleiuclusive enough.

In an attempt to complete the work started
in 1933, c continuation sccurities :Lct was passed
in 1934, Control over stock exchanges and over-
thercounter deals was included in the new legislar
lion. ,
No amount of legislation, however, can be come
plelcly effective until the public as a whole learns
to discriminate between fake offerings and the i-ccl
goods. As long as bucket shop owners can sell
socurihcs with no backing, to a public with u get-
rich-quick complex, lhey will do so. Such agents
scl up shop, geL all they can, and move out when
slowly awakening suckers begin to catch up with
them.

Brains can not be legislated into investors.
Until investors. present and future, cducale thcm-
sclves to investigate securities before they gllbly
securities which never quite get around to paying
buy, they will continue to be the proud owners of
dividends.
