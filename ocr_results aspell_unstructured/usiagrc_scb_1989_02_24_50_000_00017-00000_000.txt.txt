Purple Rain: the kid
becomes a star

by Dan Capone

Purple Rain comes from an
earlier time, a time when Prince
was popular (not so long ago,
searily enough) and he was talked
about as “the screen‘s newest

. most singular idol" (PLEASE).

It is another backstage musical
complete with the usual alienated
rock star (Kid), struggling for
success and self»dlscovery.
pursuing a beautiful girl
(Apollonia) whom he wins.
loses. and wins over once again.
There is also a triumphal concert
ﬁnale, Like most musicals it far
off-base from reality: the
struggling, and ncttr failing. Kid
is shown dressed in all the tacky
frncry of Prince. the star; even
though Kid and his band are
about to be fired from the
nightclub where they‘ve been
performing for not giving the

‘ people music they can relate to,

the customers are still in a frenzy
over the music they‘re playing.

But Purple Rain is sctni»
autobiographical, and there is an
emotional level behind it that
does genttinely show through at
times. it also treats a subject
rarely touched on in such films:
domestic violence. Kid’s father
beats his mother. When the Kid
starts seeing Apollonia, he finds
that the pattern of domestic vio-
lence has been ingrained in funk
self as well; when she informs
him that she is joining his rivals
band, he begins to slap her
around.

The films most memorable
moments are DnSlagcill is
afterall a rock star's movie about
himself and his music, how it.
and he, came to be what they are.

Alienation isStranger
than Paradise

Stranger than Paradise is,
well, strange. It is a movie
about interpersonal alienation.
And to make the sense of
alienation all the greater. director
Jim Jarmusch has kept the
context we can place the ftlm in
to a minimum. The three
characters Willie (lohn Lurie),

Eddie (Richard Edson). and Eva
(Eszter Balint) are looking for
any action that will break their
boredom. They are moved by
simple things, like card games,
watching TV (they do a lot of
that). going for a joy ride, having
a can of beer. Eva, Willie‘s
cousin. repeatedly replays one
song, Screamin‘ Jay Hawkin‘s "I

Put 3 Spell on You.” A year later
when Willie and Eddie visit her
in Cleveland. she is still playing
that one song.

The movie seemingly carries
on aimlessly in a comedy of
repressed behavior. The
characters have no redeeming
motivation, no ability to relate.
The ﬁlm was shot in black and
white, which heightens our sense
of alienation from it. its
scpamleness from our space.

Willie and Eddie do a lot of
sitting in front of the television.
join them for a little while
sitting in front of the big screen
in South Lounge.
