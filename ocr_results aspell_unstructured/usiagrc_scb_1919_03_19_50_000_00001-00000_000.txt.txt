nosed out Nebraska 22721, tying the
Cornhuskers for-gthird placein the per—

out of eight tries. Jackson of Nebraska
succeeded in only ﬁve out of eight th~
tempts. ‘

The Scarlet and Black star-ted with
a rush, getting a basket in the ﬁrst
minute of play Grinnell set the pace
thruout the ﬁrst half, keeping the hall
most of the time and leading 11—7 at
the end on the period.

half the Nebraskans evened the score.
but the scarlet ﬁve spurted and again
took the lead, and retained it for the
rest of the game. Crane starred for
Grinncll while Schellenberg was best

MEETS WITHSTUDENTS

Discusses Conditions at Dormi-
tories and Plans for Self-
Governing Body.

The spring meeting of the executive
committee of the graduate council was
held in Crrnncll'Sunday, to which a
number of renrescntan‘vc dormitory
men were invited to express their
views concerning conditions in Gl'l -
nell relating to the men and their life
at the dormitories

During themecting, which was held
in the clubr-oom of Building One, all
questions which have been at issue
since the opening of school after
Christmas were broughth up. with a
view towards solving the difficulties.

Discuss Self-Government.

A means of governing the men at
the dorms by a self-governing hotly
was brought up and suggestions as to
the best method or organizing and
making it thoroly representative were
made. Many who attended the lncotr
mg expressed the opinion that some
such organization would help mater-e
ally in solving the question of hand»
ling men's affairs, and that it would
provide a means of direct communica-
tion between the lacrrlty and the men,
which has not stcd heretofore.

After the meeting With the men, Mr-
C. s. Williston, '93, of Chicago, e -
pressed himself as being much im-
prcssed with the seriousness of [link
.pose of the present generation of Grin—
nell men, saying, “Opinions were c .
pressed openly and without rcsti 'nl:
on the part of the men, and the
.itiou is now absolutely Cler - to all.
and I am conﬁdent that this problcm
of government, when worked out, will
help solve such difficulties as have
recently arisen. Our committee has
gained more by this meeting with the
men than in any other meeting. where
we have only heard fr in them indie
rcctly and perhaps inco 'Cctly."

Cheaters Must Lenvc Campus.
, A voluntary strident organi troll
ibis been formed at the University of

the campus of all students who are

, Grinnell's chances have been greatly

year, winning ﬁrst in the conference,
third in the state, and taking both
races at the Drake relays.

”It's the same old school, all right,
but it certainly has changed a lot since
I saw it last," said captain James Nor--
man Hall this morning in commenting
upon the growth of Crrnnell.

the dormitories, bring the students we

American aviation, according to Can»
tain Hall, was rapidly becoming the
big thing at the front during the last
stages of the war. “There is no ques-

 

tion that the boys our government sent
over were good. They were mighty
good. And on top of their tlioro tritiu—
ing and ability, they had the nerve;
they weren’t afraid of anything, ap-
pitr-cntly.

“The French had planned to equip
the American aviators with Spud mar
chines when they came over, but about
the time the ﬁrst Americans sailed for
France the French aviation losses be-
gan to gel: very heavy, and their fztc~

Captain Hall dislikes publicity; it
was this dislike which brought him
here so soon. He came Monday to
