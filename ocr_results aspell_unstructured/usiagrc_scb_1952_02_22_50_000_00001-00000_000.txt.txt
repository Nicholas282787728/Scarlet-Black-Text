New Cons’ri’ruﬁon
Pu’r lo Hall Vole

In Housemeeﬁngs

Students will vote in house-
meetings Monday night to ap-
prove or reject the revised Slur
dcnt Council constitution.

Jim Morgan, president of the
Student Council, has made an
appeal for all students to vote,
as a majority of the votes of
the entire student body is re~
quired for approval of the res
vised constitution.

The revision of the consti.i
tution accomplishes two major
objectives. It brings the word-
ing of the present constitution,
which came into eflect in 1948,
up to date, In addition to this,
it makes one major change in
the process of electing six Ccnr
tral committee member at.large.
1n the present constitution, the
six members are the president
and vice presidents of the fresh
man, sophomore and junior
classes.

In the revised constitution,
these officers and the president
and vice president of the Sens
ior class would be elected in the
fall, and would be ex officio
members of the Student Counr
cil only. Shortly after the elec~
tion of these class officers, the
six repressntatives-atrlargc
the central committee would be
elected by the council from its
members, with the provision
that at least one must be from
each of the freshman, sophomore,
and junior classes.

There are several other minor
changes which will be explained
in the housemeetings by the Stu- l
dent Council representatives,
