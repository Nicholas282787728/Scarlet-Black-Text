by Thurston Fomollidge

Late afternoon last Friday. Feb. 6. a
recent acquisition to the Wyatt Collldge
Memorial Collection was discovered
missing. The work, a collage by the
Swiss—born artist Elsie Vache, was one
of the more signiﬁcant additions to the
collection.

Entitled "A White Cow Being Milked

Holding a Square Red Umbrella. with
Yellow Milkpail,” the collage is fine
example of 15th century shiss
minimalism, according to Protessor

Nicholas and Alexandra does to the
Romanovs vkhat Patton did to World
War II. Director Franklin Schallner,
who directed both. has realistically
recreated the pomp and ceremony ol
the last reigning Romanov. A line on
the Jacket of Robert K. Massie 5 book
Nicholas and Alexandra advertised it
accurately as "an intimate account" at
the reign of the last Romanov czar and
the {all of imperial Russia. This ac-
count by a well researched writer gives
us a detailed psychological portrait at a
royal lamily, their court lriends and
political advisers, It shows them
tragically isolated [mm the mass 01
their people, oppressed by personal
misfortune and unable to comprehend
the' power and dimensions oi the
historical forces playing about them.
And it shovls them becoming gradually
and unknowmgly the principal in-
struments of their oun destructionl -
