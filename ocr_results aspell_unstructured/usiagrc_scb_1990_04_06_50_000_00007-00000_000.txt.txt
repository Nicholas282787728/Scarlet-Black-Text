Women's Rugby

Ruggers Win
at Post—Game
Celebrations

By Julie Slivinsky

The women’s rugby team ended
Spring Break in style by beating
longtime rival Ludicr College at
post-match beerrdrinking games
last Sunday. In a dramatic “boat
race“ (in which a line of players
from each team mustchugabeer in
succession), Grinnell came from
behind to trounce the tired Luther
women. “We all practiced over
break, and it showed," said senior
Kristen Brown. ”Idon’tthinkwe've
ever kept up a pace like that be-
fore."

Earlier in the day, the Barbari-
ans had putup a hard fight in rugby
matches against both Luther and a
team from Iowa City. “We played
aggressively and kept a tight hold
on the other teams," said captain
J ulieSlivinskyr Aecordingtoscrum
coaCh Mary Beth Dicuer, “We
equaled Luther and Iowa City in
ability and knowledge of the game.
We had them worried for a while."

In both matches Grinnell scrumr
mies won themajority of the scmms,
and were supported by ﬂeet-footed
backs.

Grinnell also had a good show-
ing considering that the team had
only practiced outside twice previ»
ous to the matches. “Once we get
practices going. we’re really going
to have a tough team,“ said Diener.
“By the time we go to Collegiates
(an all-midwesttoumament), we‘ ll
be able to challenge anybody.“
