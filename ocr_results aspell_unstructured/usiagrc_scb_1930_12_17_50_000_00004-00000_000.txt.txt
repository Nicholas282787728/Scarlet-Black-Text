MINNEAPOLIS A Minnesota rc-
sorted to accurate shooting and clev—
er ball handling to score its second
victory of the 1930-31 basketball sea—
son here Saturday night against the
Grinnell college quint, 25 to 10,

The Gophers ran up an 18-3 lead
in the ﬁrst half, but the score at the
halfway mark by no means indicated
the amount of work necessary to pile
up the margin, The game in general
was a quiet affair. The Grinnell boys
did not hit their stride until along
in the second period, when they pep-
pered the hoop repcatcdly, buthad
a hard time making the ball drop
through the net.

Close Shots Hard

Gopher guarding was better in
this game than it has been for seve‘rr
ail seasons, and the Iowa players had
a hard time getting in for close shots,
When they did attempt short shots,
they were usually hurried on them.

A new type of play to Minnesota
fans was tried by the Gophers when
'Bondy, center, was sent into the free
throw line as a pivot man in order
to get men free on short shots. He
also was able to try a few overhand
tosses himself on the play.

Grinnell‘s Defense Good

Capt. Harry Schoening led the.
Minnesota scoring with three field
goals and a free throw. Duncan
scored a one-hand shot from inside
the Nu! line, which with Edmanls‘
throw accounted for the Grinnell
points in the first half.

Although every Gopher regular‘
scored, they did not have the easy
time that they had in the previous

lnvimtion OK the Grihneu Cmrgregar

Week's game In the second half Grin-
nell exhibited a good defense, and did
some offensive work of their own
which kept the Minnesotans stepping
fast to prevent scoring
