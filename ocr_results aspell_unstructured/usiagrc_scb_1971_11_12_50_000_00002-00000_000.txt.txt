number of students who are involv-
ed in such cratts as weaving, ma-
crame (French knotting), and ap-
plique. Paula Garbarino and Vicki

enough, just what its name implies -
the weaving or playing cards without
the use at a loom. Paula is weav-
ing a rug for practical use with
this method, while Vicki is work-
ing on a large wall hanging. Paula
is also working on a macrame wall
