Student Profile: Health and Vegetarianism

l‘llLE young people have

often been accused of think

ing themselves invincible

and engaging in short term
gratification with long-term ill ef-
fects many students are in fact
eating for long-term wellbeing.
As medical evidence accumu-
lates supporting a low-meal diet
for reducing many health risks
(such as heart disease). many
Grinnell students have lowered
their meat consumption Since
athletes try to make the most of
their bodies' potential, often it is
participation in athletics that mo-
tivates students to go vegetarian.
Such was the case for Laura
Gould ‘98. a cross country run-
ner.

She read that “being vege-
tan'an increases ynur slaw—
twitch muscle fihers, which
are ynur lung-distance mus-
cle fibers...“r this is gning to
help me. I’m going tn eat it.”
....................

A friend of hers in high school
had gone vegetarian and often
mentioned the health benefits. so
eventually Gould was convinced.
She was quite competitive in high

school cross country. and decided to
try out vegetarianism as a strategy to
improve her running.

She read that “being vegetarian
increases your slow-twitch muscle
fibers. which are your long-distance
muscle fibers..." this is going to help
me. I’m going to eat " Gould got tips
on vegetarian nutrition. from her older
brother. who went vegan a few years
earlier. Because she was never too
fond of red meat. it wasn't all that hard
to give meat up But there were a few
obstacles-like many parents. Laura‘s
were skeptical of her becoming veg-
etarian. because of the changes in
habits It would require.

But Gould has no major com-
plaints on the vegetarian options at
Grinnell. She says “It's so much
easier to do it here than at home."

Gould's commitment to vegetar-
ianism has been reinforced by her
concerns about the environment. She
explains that land is used more effi-
ciently when the grain produced goes
directly towards human consumption.
and not through a farm animal we will
eat.

Even if she didn‘t have several
reasons to not eat meat. Laura per-
sonally finds that “there's enough food
products out there. you don‘t have to."
College seems to be a convenient
time for trying new things in general.
which probably explains why a lot of
students here try vegetarianism to
differing degrees.

OTICE anythin
ferent at Qua and
Cowles this ear?
Chances are tha you
have-there was a ma-
jor overhaul of the menu
c cle during the summer.
is is a re ular occurence
for Dining ervices. which
undergoes such a change
every couple of ears. T e
menu is constan Iy evolving
behind the scenes. as Dining
Services Director Dave Mc-
Connell and staff reevaluate
the current offerings and con-
sider new 0 tions. While
most studen 5 don‘t really
know the behind-the-scenes
workings of the dining halls.
there is a heck of a lot of
organization and planning
involved in satisfyin us stu-
dents. So the next ime you
complain about the food. con-
sider the difficulties of leas-
ing a student body With di-
verse demands.

The biggest conflict in
demands Is between vege-
tarians and those who are

rossed out by unconven-
Ional dishes. ith the limit-
ed options available to dining
halls. it is often difficult to
find foods necessary for
ve etarians‘ nutritional needs
tha are also a petizing to
meat-eaters. T IS becomes
more important as the num-
ber of vegetarians at Grinnell
gradually increases. as cam-
pus olls have shown. Luck-
Ily. i appears that as vege-
tarianism becomes more
common and accepted. even
meat—eaters have become
more receptive to ve etari—
an foods. 5 ecifica y. al-
though out I 0/0 of students
in the mos recent poll (three
years ago) identified them-
selves as vegetarian. approx~
imately 23°70 of entrees tak-
en at the dinin, halls were
ve etarian. M onnellnotes
tha fake meats in particular
have increased in popularity
“prett dramatically." This is
proba Iy also due to the
reater selection in “health
oods" now available to Din-

dif-

ing Services. allowing us to get

tasty Harvest Burgers. as op-
oscd to just plain Texturized
egetable Pro ein.

While vegetarians now have
a relatively eas time finding
things to eat at t e dining halls.
vegans still don't have all that
many options. Dining Services
current oal is to offer one
vegan en ree a da . at either
lunch or dinner. ne of the
ways McConnell is trying to
accomodate ve ans is by mod-
ifying recipes hat the dining
halls currently makes by taking
out unnecessary animal rod-
ucts. The reason that ining
Services doesn't offer more
ve an dishes is that they can
on y serve so many entrees on
the line at once. and 75% of
vegetarian students surveyed
wanted their ve etarian entrees
to includeanima roducts. The
line would be be] up were there
to be a separate vegan. vege-
