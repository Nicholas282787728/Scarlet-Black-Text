Film triple-header hits campus

by Bill Waldner

Well. last Wednesday was my
birthday. Forgot didn't you, i hope
you‘re satisfied. I sat at home all
evening, ate a little ice cream, and
went to bed. Cried a little too

This is another three-film
weekend. The first film, Edvard
Munch. is sponsored by the Art
Department tor their Arts
Weekend, (Heck, artists are sort of
an ethnic minority aren't they?)
This lilm is nearly three hours
long, in German and Norwegian
with English subtitles, so be
,prepared. However, by all ac-
counts it's a superb movie, so even
it you usually don’t go in [or long
tureign iilms, try to iorce yourseli
to sit through this one.

Edvard Munch is a biographical
picture (biopic as they say in
Hollywood). Biopics iorm a genre
that reached its height in the early

lorties with ﬁlms like The Story at
Louis Pasteur, The Life of Emile
Zola, and Dr. Ehrlich's Magic
Bullet, made by William Dieterle
for Warner Brothers. More
recently, the master oi the biopic
has been Keri Russell, whose iilms
chronicle the lives of artists and
composers. Russell utilizes
editing, visual and aural imagery,
and narrative structure to capture
the mood of the artist’s work. This
technique is innovative, and
despite Russell’s frequent ex-
cesses, made [or some exceptional
iilms.

Peter Watkins’s iilm Edvard
Munch has taken the biopic a step
iurther by reiining Russell's
techniques and adding Watkins’s
own special touch. Joseph Gomez,
reviewing the film for prestigious
Film Quarterly magazine. called
the film ” . . . cinema’s most

revolutionary biographical film to
date.” The film concentrates on
the period oi 1884 to 1395 in the lite
of Norwegian artist Edvard
Munch, intercut with images and
scenes irom Munch's troubled
childhood. Munch‘s art is haunted
by images at illness, death, and
insanity. (He committed himself to
a Copenhagen psychiatric clinic in
1908, though he continued
producing art until his death at age
81 in 1944,) Along with Vincent Van
Gogh he was one or the iathers oi
the Expressionist movement.

The ﬁlm reinrorces the ieeling oi
Munch’s art by using both color
and sound in an expressionistic
way. Watkins closely identities
with Munch, and seems to line
derstand the kind or problems
Munch encountered and the impact

that these problems had on his art.
in this way, Edvard Munch is a

very personal iilm for Watkins
The film does an excellent job of
involving the viewer in the artistic
process. All of the reviews that the
iilm received were glowing, in
New York magazine John Simon
Wrote. “(A film) that nobody ins
terested in any aspect of artistic
creation can afford to miss , , ,
comes nearer than any iiim I have
seen to the impossible task oi
conveying what it means to be a
painter, an artist; what creating:
feels like, and how it is done. . . "

Now I have the task of briefly
summarizing the other two movies
for this weekend, both of which are
great movies, and both (it which
deserve longer reviews.

Red River is a 1945 Western by
Howard Hawks (To Have and llave
Not; The Big Sle'ep) starring John
Wayne, Montgomery Clitt. Walter
Brennan, Noah Beery Jr, and

a
others, Hawks is best known as a
director of comedies and actio
adventure moVies, with Red Ri ;
tailing into the latter catagory.
Along with Stagecoach and Shane,
this is one of the Classics in the
Western genre.

All About Eve (1950) was written
and directed by Joseph L.
Mankievvicz (Suddenly Last
Summer: Julius Ceasar;
Cleopatra; Sleuth), and starring
Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, the
incredibly suave George Sanders,
and tor a few minutes Marilyn
Monroe. It is the venomous tale of
an older actress nearing the end
her career and a treacherous
newcomer rising to fame. All
About Eve earned Mankiewicz two
Academy Awards for his directin 1
and screenwriting talents, aha
bagged an ”Oscar” tor Sanders for
best supporting actor.
