lmprov comedy troupe both funny and insightful

Second City came to Grinnell last Wednesday night.
For some, that sentence might not mean much. But for
those who know comedy, there is no better way to spend a
night in Grinnell, or anywhere else.

Their show consisted of three men and three women.
These six players join the ranks otpopular comedians before
them: Stephen Colbert, Tina Fey, Mike Myers and hune
dreds of others are alumni of this Chicagcrbased troupe.
They now have theaters in five cities and have been putting
on shows for almost 50 years.

“One Nation, Under Blog"was a mix ofsketch and im'
prov comedy, singing and dancing, oncehncrs and a little physi-
cal humor thrown in for good measure. At the end, two cast
members received a standing ovation. one innocently asked,
“Do you want to see some more?"

The audience exploded wrth cheers, stomping and clapping
“We Will Rock You,” much to the delight of the comedian;
They came back on after a short break and did an extra halfe
hour orirnprov, calling on the crowd tor suggestions and build
ing ottthern to create skits about things like “Gyna-spsrtnns"
and statistics classes.

The regular set would have been exceptional without this
improv bonus, The 20 short skits, mostly scripted but with
some audience participation, had no apparent unifying theme,
I even forgot the show was called “One Nation, Under Blog”
until they did a sketch about teenagers chatting on instant mes-

senger that ended up being about three parents pretending to
be their children.

The six rroupe rncrnbcrs deﬁnitely pushed the limits with
their humor. They used every single prohniry (but stopped af-
ter the “n" or the N-word), made fun or every single race (and
they were all white), gay people, straight people, religion, Re-
publicans,Democrats,Terry Schiavo,ltaqis,the military and,ot
course, the government.

If there was one unifying theme throughout, it was their
disgust for popular American culture. In one slot three female
Iraqis played a game where they got to pick one thing they
would do irthey were American. one said she would dress up
a Chihuahua in a burka. Another said she would get a Sleep
Number bed. The last one said she would get completely drunk
in a New York club, have wild sex all night with a blonde-haircd
blue-eyed man and then pay him for it in the morning, She

won the game,

The main show ended with cast members running
around the audience asking people to call out the prob—
lems they saw in the world. Issues ranged from the preva»
lence of Pizza l—[uts to Pluto no longer being a planet (the
man with the microphone said not to worry, because that‘s
where we’re going when we’re done with this one).

As things were being shouted, the performers held up
the number to Congress. One member climbed to the top
or the bleachers and began to spout out what he saw as
wrong with America.

His speech was moving and funny He yelled at us that
he was angry about plastic bags taking thousands of years to
degrade, but his iPod wouldn’t list for more than a year and a
half. He yelled that we shouldn’t put up with this “shit" any—
more, and we should do something. He told us to call Con-
gress. He told us to do anything,

At Grinnell, we’ve heard all that before But after hearing
it come tronr a man who had just done everything he could
think of to make us laugh, it seemed different.

These six people played satire well, For two and a half
hours, they were able to live within this ridiculous world, yet
reject it at thc same times And, most importantly, they made
it funny.
