Police, schools
face budget cuts

EV BEN WEVL

While some college students have trouble
scraping up money for the end of the semester,
the town of Grinnell is also strapped for cash,
and their lack of money leads to what most
would argnac are gravcr circumstances. Recently,
budger cuts have plagued both the school dis-
trict and the police department. Both the Grins
nell-Newburg superintendent and Grinnell pop
lice chiefcitcd low economic growth and state
legislative decisions as reasons for their tight
budgets,

Grinnell-Newbu rg School Dis-
trlct

Recently, Superintendent David Stoakes
sent a newsletter with the Grinnelchm/d—ch-
ism listing the many reductions the Grinnell-
Newburg school district has faced since 2001.
According to the newsletter, the cuts include
the elimination of about 20 teaching and paras
educator positions, the elimination of three 115*
sistant coaching posirions and the reduction in
substitute teacher and principals’salm’iesa

Stoakes said the budget reductions are not
new to the school district, “We've really exper
tienced budget reductions the last ﬁve or Six
years," he said. “There have been two main rea—
sons for that, One has been the lower than nor-
mal allovmble growrh, new money, new dollars,
coming from the state, and
the other has been our dcclin»
ing enrollment."

According to Stoakes, the
dccrcasc in allowable growth
happened for mainly rwo rea»
sons. “One, we saw a downe
turn in the economy over the
last two or three years, and
that certainly has had an impact on the amount
of revenue available to the state legislature," he
said. “And the other thing is that [state legislar
tors] have made millions of dollars worth of tax
cuts over the last three or four years.The philosr
ophy of the Republicansdominated [state] leg»
islatnre is to try to stimulate economic growth
rhrough cutting back on taxes.,. and} they've
also srarccd some economic development initiar
tivcs to try to get the economy going."

The declining enrollment in schools is not
unique to the Grinnelerewburg disuicc “It
is something that many, many school districts
in the state have dealt with for quite a while,"
Sroakes said. “It's probably hit us harder the
last couple years because we’ve seen a bigger
decrease than we've had previously Our enroll»
mcnt generally from the 1970s has been a grade
ual decline, but the last couple years it seems
like we’ve goncn hitwith pretty good decreases
in numbers. I’m really not sure why that is.”

According to Stoakes, the district has lost
122 kids since 2001.“That's a pretty big chunk,"
he said. Last year's senior class graduated 135
students

Stoakes, like many, is not sure how to com-
bat the problems. He said that people could try
to make the case to the Iowa legislature that the
school districts need more money, although he

acknowledged that education supporters have .

that are also looking for tax dollars from the leg-

suggested that the town needed to bring more
jobs and more families into the town.

Grinnell Police Department

The school district is not the only orgar
nization with money problems. The police
department currently faces budget issues and
the amount of total ofﬁcers in the Grinnell
department has decreased, in part due to the
lack of funds.

According to Police Chief Jody Matherly,
in the 1970s and 1980s, the police depart-
ment staff had about eight or nine ofﬁcers.
“We climbed to an alletime high in the late
90s,early 20005 to about 17 sworn personnel,"
Matherly said “Since then we’ve gone back
down to 14 sworn personnel, and that’s within
the last few months."

Matherly said that the reduction in staff is
due to more ofﬁcers leaving and rhe inability
to replace them. “We’ve had three leave in the
last year,"he said. One went to the private in—
dustry for better hours and more money. He
sells insurance now. Two others went to difr
ferent departments with more perks: one to
the county sheriff's ofﬁce and the other to the
Ankeny police dcparrmcnr. “It’s prcrry com-
mon for ofﬁcers to leave smaller dcparcmencs,a
Matherly said. “We sometimes tend to be a
stepping stone for ofﬁcers to
go on to bigger and better
things.”

The dilhculry in replac-
ing the departed ofﬁcers is

the coffers,” Matherly said.
“With Reinvent Iowa and

some of these programs the state has done
to boost the state economy, cities tend to see
a little less money, and rhar has happened."
Matherly also said that the department’s ex—
penditures on health insurance and retirement
beneﬁts have increased.

Matherly believes the department is facing
a fairly normal situation.“I think ic‘s safe to say
any city in the nation has two or three years of
good economy and then the economy drops.
And we're in that low period right now," he
said, “Three or four years ago when we were at
17 ofﬁcers, the economy called for that. There
were also some granrs available, and we were
able to put ofﬁcers on through grants, and
those have ceased to exist at this point."

Matherly is restructuring rhe police de—
partment and the hours ofﬁcers work to ad-
just to the new numbers, even if some of the
changes are not entirely popular, he said.

Matherly does not foresee the smaller po-
lice force as a problem for college students. “I
look at the college as regular citizens. They’re
just like neighbors down the road," he said.
“If you guys had a problem and you called
us, would we able to respond and answer in
Yes. We average under a two-minute response
time and we're going to continue in that di»
tection.The upside ofthe college is they have
Security that we are able to work with too. So
between us and them, We can solve any issues
or problems that occur on campus."
