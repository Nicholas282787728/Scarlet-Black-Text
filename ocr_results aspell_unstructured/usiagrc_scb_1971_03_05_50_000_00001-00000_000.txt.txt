Protesters Come Together In DM

by George Shybut

Some came to harass, some
came to plead for peace, oth-
ers for higher prices and
wages, still others to insti‘
gate revolt. They came to Des
Moines on Monday. Together
they formed the most diversi-
fied protest of government
this writer has ever had the
opportunity of attending.

The only way of understand
ing the attitude of this tenuous
coalition is from eyewitness
account. When Iarrived at the
capital building, the activities
had already begun. Nixon had
entered the edifice and was
delivering his speech to the
selected audience, who would
respond with occasional
rounds of applause. Outside
police, state patrol andsecret
service stood ready toprotect
this strange dialogue, and to
prevent any "undesirables"
from entering. A helicopter
was constantly in the air to
watch over our national lea-
der.

As I approached this Orwel-

lian setting, I could hear the
chant," . . . one, two, three,
four, we don't want yourfuck-
ing war . . ." three blocks
away. Official estimates of
the crowd were set at five
hundred. I could easily count
this many in the rear of the
building and an equal number
in front. A snow fence had
been erected on both sides of
the rear entrance to mark the
line of demarcation between
the selected and the common
classes. As I walked around
the building, I found a spot
along the capital wall where I
could hear an easily recogni‘
zed voice say ” . . . but I say
to you . . ." Istood looking
at the blank wall fora mom-
ent which to me symbolized
the very essence of U.S. gov»
ernment, a voice tobelistened
to but not questioned.

I moved along and examined
the crowds. Workers, wives,
college students, yippies,

children, and farmers milled
around, occasionally finding a
common face and talking to

one anotherl Joining half of
the crowd on one side, Ibegan
a dialogue with a secret ser-
vice guard, discussing the em,
bryological development of
himself, the police, and the
man called Nixon. Unfortuiis
ately, words like partheno-
genesis, meso- and telo-
lecithal eggs, and failure to
cleave only drew blankSLares.
A man in a silk suit stood
talking to a worker in front
of me, trying to convince him
that this was the best place to
live and to leavc the demons
stration. He further explained
that the workers did not be-
long with the students, who
didn't know anything anyway,
and wanted only to destroy
die country The worker, like
the secret service, only res-
ponded with blank stares.

On the other side of the rear
steps, the majority of demonr
strators were chanting and
discovering the use of SHOW’
balls. A couple of youths at-
tempted to scale the side of

Magee To Offer Counter— Plan

James Magee, associate pro-

fessor of political science,
will present a substitute for
President Leggett‘s faculty
reorganization proposal at
Monday's faculty meeting at
4:15 in ARH Auditorium.

Beryl Clotfelter, chairman
of the faculty, is expected to
open the meeting with a few
observations on Magee's spa
each at the February 22meet-
ing. The remarks are expected
to be generally sympathetic
to Magee‘s speech and pur-
pose.

Magee then plans to offer his
substitute motion and to call
for a straw vote to determine
only if the faculty is willingat
this time to consider such a
substantive proposal or if it
would prefer to return to Pre~
sident Leggett's more limited
proposal. A yes vote at this
time would not constitute an
endorsement of the proposal
itself.

The motion calls forabolish-

ing all standing committees of
the faculty, except for the Ex-
ecutive Council, the Academic
Standing Committee, and the
Admissions Committee. The
President and the two Deans
of the college would lose their
voting powers on the Execu-
tive Council, but would re-
main in an ex officio capacity.
The chairman of the faculty
would be responsible for
drawing up the council‘s
agenda as well as making
”regular and substantive" re

ports to the faculty "on the
work of the Executive Council
and on the state of the Col-
lege."

The purpose of the above
changes would be to more
clearly separate faculty and
administration. The Executive
Council would be a faculty ad-
visor committee, not a
pseudo administrative com-

pairtstee run by the administra-

Under Magee’ s proposal, the
Executive Council will be

charged with preparing 'reg-
ular and periodic analyses
and projections of trends
within college operations for
the faculty‘s guidance."

Six students with full voting
powers are to be included on
the council; however, ‘it is
recognized that on certain
matters . . . (personnel) l . .
students might normally be
expected to be excluded from
direct participation."

The council is empowered to
create any subcommittees and
committees it feels are nec-
essary to carry out its work.
This might include many ofthe
nowVexisting committees, al-
though Magee hopes the £aculty
would remove itself from all

non‘academic committees.
The major effect of the pro-

posal would be to make the
council the central organiza-
tional body in the college. ’ill
faculty committees would be
created by it and wouldreport
to it. In turn, the council,thrr
ough the chairman of the fac-
ulty, would be called upon to
report on all its activities
directly to the faculty.

Supreme Court Throws Out Appeal

For the secondweekina row,
the Supreme Court has re
fused to hear a case involving
Grinnell students. The Court
refused Monday to hear an
appeal by State Atty. Gen.
Richard Turner that objected
to a lower court ruling that
he acted illegally when he
seized copy that was to be
printed in the Pterodactyl,
Grinnell's now defunct under
ground newspaper.

Henry Wilhelm and Larry
Frank, former Grinnell stud-
ents, brought the copy to the
printer on March 13, 1969.
Asst. Atty. Gen. Douglas Carl-
son had learncdfrom the prilr
ter that the copy was to be
brought to him that day, and
he wrote a letter requesting
the printer to turn over the

materials to the attorney gent
eral's office. The printer cor
Opereted in full.

The copy was photographed
and held as “evidence." “Re-
spondents' prorests and re
quests for immediate return
of the materials were Ignored,
as were their claims of pre-
publication copyright. No
search warrant was ever se»
cured; no prior judicial de*
termination of obscenity was
had; Respondents' permission
for the seizures was not sought
or granted; and no criminal
charges based on the alleged-
ly obscene materials were
ever filed.‘I

Wilhelm and Franks appeal-
ed to the U.S. District Court
for return of the materials
and for punitive chmagcsThe

first request was upheld, the
second denied. Both parties
appealed to the U.S. Circuit

Court of Appeals, where the
decision was the some. Tur-
ner then appealed to the Supr
reme Court.

The newspaper was printed
after the District Court ruling
forced Turner to return the
copy.

The High and Mighty, suc-
cessor to the Pteroda ctyl, has
been unable to find a printer
in Iowa and thus has been
forced to cease publication.
Informed sources claim that
the publicity l‘L‘CeH‘Cd b_ this
case and the further pi ure
from the attorney ucneral‘s
office are the ca ‘kS of The
High and Mighty Llifflculi'
ies.
