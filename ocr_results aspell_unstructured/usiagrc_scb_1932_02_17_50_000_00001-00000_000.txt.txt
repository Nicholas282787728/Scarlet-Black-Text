Runners Open
Indoor Season
at Iowa State

Duke Counts on Murphy,
Thomas, Pilbrow

for Points

Led by Carcaptains Dick Murphy
and Hank Thomas, and two stellar
drstance runners. Myron Prlbrow and
Joe Pfeiffer, the Grinnell college
track team under the direction of
Coach Lester Duke will open the 1932
indoor track season Saturday when
it meets Iowa state in a dual meet
at Ames.

Coach Duke entertains little hope
for a Pioneer victory, since the squad
is weak in all field events, in addition
-to the hurdles. This lack of balance
will count heavily against the Grin—
nell team, despite the fact that the
strength of the Cyclones is compar-
atively unknown.

Quartet of Sprinters

Alexander, Pojman, G012. and
Gregson form a quartet of sprinters
who will compete in the 50 yard
dash. Corcaptaln Thomas and Pop
man make the outlook for the 440
formidable, while Murphy, Lund and
Cor-hardt will compete against some
of the nation’s best in the half-mile.
Labertew, Cyclone star. was recently
placed on the national collegiate
honor roll in this event, while Gordon
Nagel ie a dependable man in both
the half-mile and quarter-mile.

Coach Duke will rely heavily on his
distance runners to bring home the
points in the mile and t\vo»mile, al-
though it is doubtful he will
double Pilbrow and Pfeiffer this ear-
ly in the season. Pilorow turned in a
fast mark last Saturday. running the
two-mile under 10 rnnutes, while
Pfeiffer‘s time in the mile approached
mid-season form.

Thomas in Hurdles

Hank Thomas has shown promise
in the low hurdles, During time-trials
at the Drake fieldhouse Saturday. he
came within one»tenth of a second oi
the fieldhouse record. other hurdlers
who will compete are Gene and Wal-
lace Grounds, and Burton Holmes.

A quartet of broad-jumpers should
give the pioneers strength in that
event, although the men have had no
opportunity to practice yet. Rose and
Lake will carry the brunt in the
weight events, although both are
sophomores and have had no previous
experience. Grinnell has no entries in
the pole-vault.

, Expert Competition

The Pioneers will meet expert com-

petition in such men as Kenneth
Wells, sprinter, Labertew and Nagel,
middle distance runners, Chapman,
miler, Eichelkrout. two-miler. and
Highsmith, sophomore star in the
mile. .
The personnel of the Grinneu squad
has not been definitely decided upon,
but it is probable that about 20 men
will be taken.

Colonial Ball Will Give Women

Authority on

By MAmvaTS KONECNY

Grinnell coeds who are a bit timid
about practicing leap year etiquette
on the stronger sex will have a unique
opportunity to experiment among
‘themselves.

After next Saturday night they
will be more authoritative than
Emily Post on such subjects as
proper side on which to Walk while
escorting st lady, and how to keep her
from ordering a College Special sun-
dae at 50 cents. The educating factor
is the Colonial ball—the only dance of
the year which the Women have 2.
complete monopoly and at which half
of them dress as men and the rest as
demure colonial maids.

George and Martha are not con-
,sistent residents at tho quadrangle
but only make a limited appearance
each year sometime about the last of
February, This week the women are
heralding their arrival by digging old
costumes fragrant wrth lavender (or
mothballs) from trunks, bringing
family lace to light, looking pcl'ple»
crlly at ancient foz'mzlls lto sec if they
can be transformed into Costumcs of
a still more ancient vintage, or are

ther's last summer’s plus-fours.

The maids and their beauir will dine
in costume at the quadrangle Satur-
day night. When they invade the
men’s gymnasium to take part in the
grand march which begins at 7:45,
instead of the usual Temple of Sports
they will enter a pretty old-fashioned
garden surrounded by a white picket
fence, the transformation having been
wrought by the Women’s Athletic ass
sociation board which sponsors the
dance. This year’s chairman of the
affair is Rose Casady.

Although the Virginia reel and the
Rye waltz may have the connotation
of pre-prohibition dances to the un-
ini 'oted, they are respectable and es-
tablished numbers on the program of
the party as is the firefly dance which
is the traditional close of the evening,

No onc not dressed in costume will
be admitted to thc iloor College men
are rcquestcd to Caroperate by ab-
sentrng themselves from all but tho
balcony during the entire evening
since this is a strictly feminine frolic.
They will be allowed to watch from
the balcony on presentation of Se

may observe the Georges and Mar-thus
at a charge of 35 cents for adults and
25 ccnts for children.

Coeds Approve
Gym Training
in Questionair’e

Eighty of so Grinnell college Wom~
on taking required physical education
work would have the present system
continued, according to a question-
aire recently filled out anonymously
at the request of Miss Clara Ander-
sen, head of the department of physi-
cal education for women.

Various opinions were expressed in
the replies. The reason for requiring
physical education was, in the ma-
jority of cases. physical development.
others suggested that physical edu-
cation also tends to reduce Sclfrcoilr
lsClCusness by teaching motorrco-
ordination.

The five women who do not favor
requircd physical education explained
4.11;", it was the word “requu‘cd” to
which they were particularly opposed.
.Anytliing which is l'equlz'ed, they sug»
gcsted, rs unpopular and causes the
reaction of dislike.

Several questionnaires filled out by
senior-s indicated that the academic
schedule for fourth-year students is
over-balanced, and overcinpliasizes
mental development to the entire
neglect of the physical.

Records of Both Quintets
Show Eccentric Play
in Circuit Tilts

Bill Boeitel": Bulldogs, represent-
atives of Drake university on the bes-
ketball court this season. will provide
competition for Grinnell college cag-
ers at Des Moines Friday night.

Weakened by the loss of four squad
members, King, Sebastian, Ross, and
looks, who were dropped for break~
ing training rules, the Drake team
has proved one of the most in and
out ball clubs in the Missouri Valley
circuit, and at times shows a sensa-
tional brand of play, only to offset
this with glaring errors.

Lose to Blucjrrys

After chalking up victories over
Grinnell and Washington university,
the blue and white representatives ap-
peared on their way up. but they were
overwhelmingly defeated last night

by the Bluejays of A. A. Schabinger
at Creighton.

The temperamental Pioneers are
dopcd for first place on the tilt, but
fans recall that they were also doped
to take the Drake game hereiand
didn’t. The brand of play they showed
in downing Washington this week
makes them favorites.
Detensc Works

Coach John C. Truesdale has his
scoring trio. Duncan, Rowe, and Frye
pounding the basket in notable fash-
ion, and his man to man defense was
working in top style against Don
White‘s Bears Monday.

With Don King out of the lineup,
Frank Smith is the big threat of the
Des Moines outfit and will be the ob-
ject of a large share of Pioneer de-
fensive attention. Schultz, six foot
tour inch center for the Bulldogs, will
control the tipoff and will be a key
man in the Drake attack,

Pioneers Trim
Washington, 29-30

Staging a rally which netted 14
points in the final six minutes of play,
the Grinnell basketball team over
whelmed the Washington university
five, 29 to 20, on the Grinnell floor
Monday night. The victory tightened
the Pioneers hold on second place
and shoved the Bears further down
in the conference standings. If the
Grinnell cagers can down Drake Fri-
day night, it will cinch second place
for them.

Coach Truesdale’s men started out
well and at half—time had piled up a
12-7 lead, with Hank Duncan and
Mickey Frye leading the scoring. Im»
mediately after the start of the sec»
and half, the Bears crept closer, and
finally forged ahead on baskets by
Kern, Landwlrm and Wise to take
the lead is to La.

Manor ﬁlters Game

At this point, ullrich came through
with a long shot to put the Pioneers
but one point behind. 'hvo baskets
by Don Rowe and a free toss by Cap-
tain Mccreary sent the Grinnell team
into the lead, 22 to 18. At this junc—
ture, Coach Don White inserted Bob
Mautz, Washington's stellar sopho-
more forward, who contributed the
final Bear (ally.

Baskets by Duncan and Rowe put
the Pioneers well ahead with only a
minute to go. The latter dropped in
a pair of free throws as he left the
game, and Mccreary completed the
scoring with another gift toss. just
before the gun sounded.

ltowc Stnrs

Rowe’s sensational last half scor.
ing spree, netting tour field goals and
two free throws, was the most impor-
tant factor in the Grinnell victory, ale
though defensive work of Frye, Ull-
rrch, and McCrenry thwarted Boar
attempts to score. Hank Duncan,
sliarpshooting ace, furthered his
claim to owl/alley honors by con»
tr-ihuting four field goals.

For Washington, Maysztcl: and
Kern each scored four points, but on
the whole, Washington's scoring aces
were bottled up by the Grinnell de-
