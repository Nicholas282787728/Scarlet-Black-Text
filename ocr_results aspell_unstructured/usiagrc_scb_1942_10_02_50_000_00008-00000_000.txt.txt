7-6 defeat
at the
Fighting

Reboundmg from a
in the season's opener,
hands of Monmouth's

Scots. the Pioneers spent thefirst
three practices this week on m-
tensive contact work.

Much of the time was spent
on defensive weaknesses which
showed up in last week's game.
“If our defense isn't any better,
it’s not because we haven’t work»
ed on it,” said Coach Ben Doug»
las Thursday.

With an eye on tonight‘s an-
nual tilt with Drake, always a
classic, in the Drake stadium in
Des Moines. the coach has had
the team scrimmaging the fresh
using the Bulldogs‘ plays.

Drake, traditional foe of the
scarlet and black, will he using
freshmen, and will be fighting
to make a comeback after dropr
ping the opener last week to St.
Ambrose.

“However,” says the Pioneer‘s
mentor, “We don‘t oonoedo any-
thing, And I think that old lady
luck's going to smtle on us."

Both as a result of the inten-
sive work and of last week’s
game, several players have suf
fered injuries which have necessi»
tated shifts in the lineup.
Grudning Back

Only change in the backfield
lineup is in the fullback spot
where Augie Grllelllng, recovered
from a cold but lacking somewhat
in practice, will replace Phil
Southworth who saw a good deal
of action in the Monmouth game.
Sauthworth is still Suffering from
a severe hip injury and will be
unable to play tonight.

Ed Nagel, who received acouple
of severe charley horses in the
Monmouth match has recovered
and will be able to start against
Drake.

Meanwhile a recurrance of an
old knee injury has put Chuck
Hultgren, reserve center out for
the rest of the season, leaving
Douglas with no reserve for the
center position, To remedy this,
he has moved Johnny Miller to
that position, filling Miller's old

ulllllllllﬂﬂIIIIHIIEIEEIEEEEIHBEE,

Fear held by many students for
the intramural program this year
was dispelled as competition be-
tween old and new rivals opened
on the gridiron this week,

The first game of the season.
Monday afternoon. was Dibble vs.
North Read with Dibble handing
the from a 3370 pasting

Dibble’s Millikan. Gee, and Rob-
ison pounced on the inexperienced
preps at the outset and never let
up, Dick Ryden and “Wee Willy"
Smith formed a good passing
combination for ,North Read
which gave Dibble a few mo—
ments of anxiety

South Read, with three upper-
classmen in their line up, refused
to follow the footsteps of their
hall members Tuesday by trip»
ping Gates 670. Bob Crandall
passed to Bill McKecn to give
the South Siders their score. 0n
the line, Johnny Allen was out-
standing fnr'Rsad while Ralph
Hart played a hang-up game in
Gate's backfield.

In an overtime game Wednes-
day afternoon, Smith nosed out
Clark 7-6. Kolp’s interception of
a Clark pass put the Smith boys
in front until Ed Krause passed
to Seidlim for the tying score.
The overtime finale found Smith
in Clark territory, thereby giving
them their margin of victory.

Rhwson. in taking the measure
of Town la-s yesterday, displayed
a strong offense. Howard Smith
carried the ball over for Raw-
son'a first score, and then passed
to Johnson for their second touch-
down. a pass from Frisbie to
strong gave Town their only

score, Kaherle and Johnson were
outstanding for Rawson, while
Strong and Morgan starred for
Town.

It is difficult to make any
prognostication as to the season's
final outcome, according to in-
tramural fans, but one week of
observation has disclosed several
facts,

They are, primarily, that Dibble
and Rawson are strong, and loom
as the toughest contenders for
the championship. south Read
and Smith appear to he the dark
horses of the race. Good opposi-
tion Will be furnished however,
by Gates, Clark, North Read,
and Town, with any one of these
capable of scoring an upset.
