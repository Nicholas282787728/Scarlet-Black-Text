Actor’s Eight Characterizations Range ,
From Shakespeare’s Hamlet to I‘olanthe

‘Final Call’

Number on Repertoire

Most Popular

Friday Evening

Impersonating dramatic characters
from such varied sources as the
Bible, “Hamlet," and Gilbert dc Sulr
livan’s “Iolanthe,” v. L. Granville,
English actor, presented his recital of
“Dramatic Intel'lutlcs” in Herrick
chapel last night.

Rapid changes of costume and
makeup, made in darkness upon the
stage ,fcatured the program, Only a
low seconds after appearing in eve-
ning clothes, the actor Was seen as
n primping widow, as a brilliantly
robcd Japanese, or a wliite-wiggcd
Lord Chancellor.

Listens in Vain

Comcdies and forces alternated
with the more serious drama through—
out the program. Thc climax of the
entertainment was reached whcn An-
dre helplessly listened to his Wife's
telephone plea for help in De Lorde's
"The Final Call.”

Laughter at the song and antics
of the Lord Chancellor, from ”Iolan-
the,” turned to horror when "The
Fluttcring Hands” strangled Uda,
Prince of Sakamota, in the Japanese
fantasy by Kawctaki Mokuami. Dis—
gust was mingled with horror at the

mad Emperor Nero's cruelties, as
portrayed by sienkiewicz in "Quo
Vadls.”
Errand—Boy

The trials of a hardworking father
who was the neighborhood errand-
boy, provided an amusing interlude,
Ivan Ivanovitch Tolkachov, from a
short story by the Russian, Anton
Chekhov, was the character

The solemnity of Job's appeal to
God was followed by the wailings of
Strepsiades in condemning the young—
er generation, which was “going to
the dogs" even in the ancient Greece
of Aristophanes ”The clouds."
Lady Wishford

Tlic primpings and the amorous
’otithursts of Lady Wisliford, the old
(widow trying to imprcss a marriage-
ablc lord, were realistic both as to
voicc (mil to dress. Lady Wishford is
from William Collgrevc’s "The Way
‘of the World."

Shakespeare's familial “To bc or
not to he" lines from “Hamlet" drcw
much applause for the actor, while a

rather unnatural interpretation of

Uriah Heep’s humility, from Dickells‘
“David Copperfield," was not poplin
lar.

In the absence of a, drop Curtain,
Mr. Granville asked that his black»
clad property boy he considered in-
visible. Before his appearance ho
protestcd strongly against appearing

 

_in the chapel without a curtain.

Dibble.

Gates, Langan and Smith appear
to have the strongest aggregations.
The former, with the veterans, Victor
Fini, William Canright, Robert Ev-
ans, William Evans, and Don Ross, is
tapetted to furnish a batch of trou-
,ble for any of the other five teams.
Langan also has a veteran squad ins

Howard Whitney, speed king of the
freshman tank team, should prove
an asset.

Smith, with a plentiful supply of
freshman nstatcrs, added to the vet-

to select. The GaleSrSmith contest
Saturday will probably be the head-
liner of the first round, as both are
doped as strong contenders for the
title.

Watt Points Out Value
of New Football Rules

__.—.___i__

In response to the popular demand
for more lenient rules to govern
passing, the National Football Rules
committee recently effected two new
rules.

According to the first, the offen<
sive team no longer loses the ball on
c touchback by passing across the
goal line, unless the pass is made on
the last down. The second change
eliminates the fiveryal'd penalty for
two incomplete passes in a series of
downs, though the penalty still holds
for a third and fourth unsuccessful
attempt during a scrics.

lotions, L. L Walt, head football
coach, remarked yesterday, “Teams
with good pass and rcccivcrs will
unquestionably be aided by the now
rules, 1 also believe that teams with
isti-ohg running cttac s will find their
jaclvcrsary-s dclcuso spread out more
lto guard against passcs, and will
thus find the dcfcnsc not so fully prc-
pared to meet running plays."

Use Harper’s

‘Actlon in “Cox and Box,“ cpcretta
by Gilbert and Sullivan, takes place
in about 1870. For authentic models

(the long undisturbed files of Harper's

Weekly for that year were routed
out and bearded gentlemen were ex-
amined with gravest attention to
their every whisker. Illustrated copies
of Dickens were searched for peculi—
arities in costume of the time.

The scene is a London rooming
house, and the action results from
the assignment, by error, of the same
room to the gentlemen, Cox and Box,
portrayed by Albert Rose and Dave
Phillips. Song hits include "Rata—
pan,” and “Sixes.”
Three Sad Bravos

Nonrrealistlc makeup will be used
in the Phillip Mueller play, “Pokey,”
maintaining the effect produced by
the modernistic stage setting by Mare
garet Wright.

Book after book was [numbed
through for ideas on correct garnish—
ment for the faces of the three sad
remaining braves of the tribe of Pow-
hsttan. Designs pictured on ancient
Indian masks will be superimposed
on the features of the braves, Rich‘-
ard Mattox, James Clynch, and Rob-
ert Irwin.

The play is a burlesque of the Po-
cahontss-John Smith incident in his«
tory, and also sstirizes Longfellow’s
poem, “Hiawatha.” The scene is that
of a forest at the edge of a c1iff~

Lack of Strength in

Relays Defeats

Varsity Swimming Team Here Friday

Carleton Outfit Wins 42-33
in Hard Fought Battle;
Malbrough Stars

Lack of strength in the two relay
events proved too great a handicap
for the Gl'illuell mermen and allowed
Carleton to chalk up a hard won 427
33 victory in it swim mcct held in
the local pool yesterday afternoon.

Although the Pioneers held a four
to two edge in individual victories,
the visitors annexed both the lGO-l
yard lrce stylc relay and the loo-yard
medley wh :h more than made up the
difference. Both relays went “l rc-
cord Lillie.

Dave Malbrougli stamped himself
as the outstanding swimrncr in the
meet by taking first in three events,
the 100 and 220-yitrd free stylc and
tho loo-yard backstroke, He cstahr
lishcd a new pool record in the long
event, traveling the distance in 2:7
34.2

Bud Toget and John Sllepllm'd, vct-
erans from last year's team who
swam yesterday for the first time
this season, each contributed to the
Crinneli score, Tcget won the 40-yard

 

free style and Shephard took second

in the diving competition. The latter
was hampered by a bad knee or he
might have done better.

The closest finish of the meet oc-
cured in the IODryard breast stroke
in which Taggart of Crinnell llosed’
out Schochow of the visiting team
by no more than a foot margin to
gain second place.
