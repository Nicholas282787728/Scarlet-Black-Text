Brazil

By Serge Strosherg

Some or the recent Monty Python
movies, “Time Bandits” and ‘The Mean
ing or LIfe" do not show the subtle,
humorous qualities diat made the British
comedy team so popular and loved by
American audiences, “Brazil," directed
by Terry Gilliam, one of the notorious
team's members. is not an exception to I
this iate, I

Because it treats the liie conditions ot a I
1984ctype futuristic world with a lot oi lmc I
agination, sarcasm and good acting
(thanks to Robert De Nirol, “Brazil” '
could be a good movie. It me beginning oi I
this picture is clear and subtle, it soon '
starts to turn into a confusing cacophony '
with low-level scatological gags which con l

oi humor. The only interest that “Brazil" I
can bring is its total abstractness
However, this abstractness presents |
disturbing similarities to the famous iilm I
“A Clockwork Orange”, directed by I
Stanley Kubrlck and the iilm adaptation of
Orwell's novcl “1984". Yet, alter watching
this excessively long movie (more than 2
hours long), one may come away wonder»

it your idea or an entertaining evening
includes back to back “Love Boat" rerunsI
then the roller coaster ride through Terry
Gillam’s “Brazil" will leave you dazed and
confused, -The surrealistic nature of
“Brazil” dominates the viewer into a
twisted world where endless red tape
results from a simple plumbing job.
Perhaps only a Monty Python fan could
find humor when a man is tortured and
killed due to a typograhical error.
However, once dragged into this world
where the absurd is the status ouo and
reality is considered obscene, the only way
to stay one step ahead of the simllarities in
our own lives is to laugh. Antis
bureaucratic overtones coat every action,
inevitably leading to political analysis.
Spiced with intense sound and intricate
