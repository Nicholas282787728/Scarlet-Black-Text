At 4:15 this afternoon the home
team will cross bats with the Mow
moulll ball players. who arrrved
this morning. The Monmouth
team has made a great rcpulation
foritselfthisspringamongthellll-
nol< learns and without doubt will
prove itself a worthy competitor
this afternoon. The home team,
however, have shown that they are
capable ot playing good tast ball,
and it will be interesting to com-
pare their work with that at a team
which comes from outside the
state. The game will be called
promptly at 4:!5. The visitors will
play the following nren: Center,
Fulton; pitcher. Ochiltl'cc; ﬁrst
base, Black; second basc,Wallace;
third base. McCoy; shortstop,
