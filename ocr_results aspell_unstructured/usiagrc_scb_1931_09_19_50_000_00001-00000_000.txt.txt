Grinncll college football eleven made
consistent gains against the fresh—
men Thursday and Friday. .

Although they were outweighed
several pounds to a man. the Pion-
eers' forward wall opened holes
through which James. Ullrich, Mc<
Creary. and Thomas plowed for long
gains. Few forward passes were
tried, but Grinnell‘s spot pass was
working.

Lake Returns

Injuries still continued to haunt
the team, but the ardor of ’the men
was not dampened. Frank Spang-
ler. reserve halfback, suffered a brok-
en bonc in his foot and will be out
of the lineup for a month.

a slight illness. Figland has been
nursing a twisted knee. but will
probably be ready for action again

have the inside track on the other

ing some good work. however, and

a strong bid for a regular place.

Graflund. Rosenbloom. Martin, Er—

have been seeking action at the
guard posts. while Captain Christof—
fersen has been shifted to that post
occasionally.

Gates Hall Will Defend Title Won .
From Dibble in Speedball Last Year

 

Although the team will be weak-
ened by the graduation of Lester
Scott, one of the best specdball per—
formers in the history of the school.
Gates ball will make an attempt to
retain its title in the fall intramural
sport this year.

The Gates team last year hand-
cd Dibble. previous champion, the
ﬁrst defeat in the eight years. Dibble
had held the title Since speedball was
introduced at Grinncll. The former
holders, also lost to Langan. Smith
and Dibble ﬁnished in a tie for sec-
ond with three wins and two losses.
while Langan and Clark were tied
for fourth place.

The Schedule for the season's
games has not been arranged. but
each ball Will meet the other build—
ings once. The round robin is sched~
ulcd to begin Sept. 23.

Clark hall looms as the most Ser-
ious contender for the title. Clark
has four men who received all—dorm—

 

itory mention last year available for
this season. They are Holmes, Frye.
Roth. and Rowe. In addition. Bennett
Wescott, and John Edwards. arc de-
pondable men.

Dibble. Langan. and Smith look
good, and any one of them may be a
dark horse. Dibblc will be forced to
recruit a team from the freshman
ranks. but Ferrara, Davis. Straley.
and Pa‘fzybok will form a veteran
nucleus.

Langan ball will have an allrdorml-
tory full-back in Stan Hipp. and a
well—balanced group to round out the
team. Smith hall's hopes will lay in
a well-balanced team led by Gwynne
Vaughan. another all-dormitory Soles»
tion.

Both Gates and Rawson halls will
he handicapped by a lack of veteran
mater l. but may develop some out»
standing players among the fresh-
mcn. Captains will be clcctcd next
week.

‘Society (our Individualislic’
Says Strong in Chapel Talk

Modern society is too highly indi-
vidualistic according to Earl D.
Strong. professor of economics. who
spoke on “Economics in Modern So-
Ciely" at the Thursday chapel ser-
vice.

What we need. he said. is a social
economic school of thought which
can keep pace with modern science
and possibly direct capltolistic soci-
ety to a conciliation of two impend-
ing situations. over production and a
starving populacc. .

for Convention
of Association

Cooperative Plan Includes
All lowla- High School
Journalists

Plans for the reorganization of the
Iowa High School Press association.
an organization of high school jour-
nalists. which has met in Grinnell
annually for the last 11 years. were
formally approved at a meeting of
Grinncll chapter. Sigma Delta Chi,
in the Varsity tearoom Thursday
noon.

Heretoforc the local journalistic
fraternity has sponsored the meet—
ing here annually while other high
school associations have held con-
ventions at various times at the Uni—
versity of Iowa. Iowa State college.
and Drake university.

Will (Do-operate
Under the new arrangements the

’ four institutions will cooperate in

sponsoring a statewide high school
journalistic association which will
meet here in its twelfth annual con~
vention Oct. 30 and 31 for its re-
organization.

Thc reorganization is the outcome
of a conference here last fall which
was attended by Herschel M. Colbert,
head of the Grinncll department of
journalism; Frank L. Mott. director
of the school of journalism at the
University of Town; George H. Gall-
up. then head of the Drake univer-
sity department of journalism. and
Blair Converse. head of the depart-
ment of technical journalism at Iowa
State college.

Here Every Four Years

It was suggested at this meeting
that the association he reorganized
and broadened to make it a state-
wide high school press association
and to ask the journalism section of
the State Teachers association to be-
come the advisory body for the or-
ganization. This plan will be car~
ried out. Suggestions have been pre-
sented to all members of the Iowa
High School Press association and
were approved by a heavy majority.

Under the new plan the association
will meet annually at one of ‘the four
institutions sponsoring the plan, the
ﬁrst meeting going to Grinnell,
where the association was founded
12 years ago. This meeting will be
similar to other high school press
conventions here alhtough the pro-
gram has not been definitely com-
pleted. ‘ ‘ .
