oriunul collngo was founded in isle lmd um

TO THE ALUMNI

Appropriately, Grinnell college
has set aside EL day each year, as
do other institutions, when pres
out and former students may as-
socidte with each other on the
campus, both groups receiving
profit and inspiration from this
association.

It is unnecessary for us to point

out the fact that Grillnell llils been

ddvzlnciliginor to give the reuse
ons, That will alway be the policy

of the “Harvard of the \Vest.”

The Scarlet and Black wishes to
take tllis opportunity to greet all
returning Alumni, on behalf of
the entire student body, and hopes
they will feel free to return to
their “old haunts” and, make
themselves at home during their
stay here.

Whether it is because of the
spirit of tradition or the uncon-
scious respect for its standards,
liolllecoluillgs zlt Grilmell are dif-
ferent from those at many other
institutions.

A riotous parade for, retn’iillg
alumni is replaced by a dignified
chapel. at ll’hieh‘ithe some cn<

tllnsidsln is shown, although in tin

entirely different way.

The football game is nbout the
only outlet for such exllullerzlncc.

It is not for the students to
judge whether or not th oom-
lneutlohle. Perhaps, to the l'etill’llr
iiig alumni, who are being feted.
llOIlICL’DIlllng is something more
thml o more celebration, and is
rather, o direct contort, with the
allllzl motor which they will never
lose contact with.

“G7
STUDENTS AWAKENING
(The Daily Cardinal)

The American college student can
never be accused of being too soc-
ially»col:lscious. So strong, however,
is the Social-ennsciausness of the
European university student that
riots and studentnomcnstraticns
over poiiLical and economic issues are
not uncommon there. In America,
riots of college students occur only
at football games. .

Howovcr there are signs that the
social point of view is beginning to
assert itself on the American camp—
us. Last year 3, group of students
at Columbia university decided that
the reports or terrioi-ism in the Vir-
ginia coclficlds just couldn’t be true
Howcvcr, instead of consulting thcir
textbooks about the constitutional
rights of the individual, the iglii. at
nabocs corpus, ctc, they decided to
see for tiicmsclvcs wlict it was rill
about. They did. And they didn’t
have to remain long in Kentucky to
be convinced.

The purpose of the university,

point of view, so far do we achieve
a fruitful education. insofar as those
subjects ore pursued for their own’
sake, divorced from the needs and,
considerations of humanity as a‘
whole, so for do we achieve only a’
sterile accdcmicism. And insofar as'
we go to school and Study merely for!
increased earning power or better
social status that a, college dogroo‘
supposedly brings, so far do we]
achieve only a debasemcnt of learn-l
ing and knowledge.
Social-mindeduess is not lem‘ned‘
from the textbook and memorized. It
is an attitude, an outlook on life, an
appraisal of the things which are soc-
ially significant. It is awakened and
fostered by means of school subjects,
and textbooks, But it can and fro-l
quently is better fastened by an extra/
curricular interest in affairs outside
the Classroom. Some students, many
on this campus, are interested in im—
proving political and economic con—
ditions in the state and Country; they
form Progressive clubs, and social
problems forums. Others are interes-
ted in preventing another catastro-
phic world war; they organize Green
Inter-nationals and anti-war congress-
es, and protest against in tarism.
Still others are chcemeli with the
economic conditions of the laboring
classes; they organize expeditions and
try to investigate these conditions
for themselves at first: hand.

The list of these student activities,
even in America, and even on this
campus, is growing longer as stu-
dents are becoming more and more
social-minded and progressive in their
outlooks. It is a cause for rejoicing,
for it indicates that, after 2111, per.
hope the citizens and taxpayers are

I not spending their money solely for

the creation of waters at football
games.
._G_

Subtilty in those who make
profession to teach or defend the
truth hilth passed for ii. virtue; a
virtue, indeed, which, consistng
for the most part in nothing but
the fallacious and illusory use of
obscure or deceitful terms, is only
fit to make men more conceited ill
their ignorance.ELoclle.

When .i man is made up wholly
of the (love, without the least
grain of the serpent in his compo-
sition, he becomes ridiculous in
many circumstances of hick-Ade
dison. .
