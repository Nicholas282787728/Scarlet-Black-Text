Opinion

The Scarlet & Black begins the semester in retrospect. This
editorial appeared in the Scarlet & Black of October 4, 1933. Though
nearly fifty years have passed since that time, the message is as im-

portant today as it was then.

THE STUDENT AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
This depression has been a geat chastisement to the American stu—
dent. It has rudely awakened him to the realization that he is a part
of a social whole, and that when society suffers, he suffers.

Besides financially embarassing many students, and preventing
others from returning to school, this period of economic stress has
stimulated the student to think of his education and his place in the
world in a different light from which he has been accustomed. The
orthodox conception of higher education has been purely in-
dividualistic in nature College was looked upon as a place where one
could get a head start on the other fellow in the struggle for ex-
istence; or, as a place for absorbing “culture,” so that one could
speak nonchalantly of literature and art, and talk glibly in French.

This idea of a college education is rapidly yielding to the concep-
tion of higher education as the basis for fitting men and women to
play a positive role in their community, It is not enough for college
graduates to enter business or the profession in order to make
themselves economically secure. They have a definite responsibility
to society, and should use their privileged education in doing their
part in social construction and human betterment,

Breathless Through the Browning Corn

Running on the country roads that divide
and subdivide Iowa can be a humbling ex
perience. The broad fields that stretch on
and on and the vast Sky that hangs
overhead often combine to make me feel
small and insigniﬁcant as I trot dutifuﬂy
on

One or my runs this week took me out
beyond the comfortable realms of Grinncll
and into the country. 1 ran alone that day.
save for the company of the heat, Hie corn
and the sky. I was not waxing
philosophical that day. and was feeling
none of the awe at the size and scope of my
surroundings that often strikes me, What I
felt was boredom and monotony at the
singularity of the landscape and a growing
distaste for the unrelenting heat ﬂiat was
making my life as a budding athlete rather
miserable.

Iran feeling sorry tor myself. and as the
fields of corn went by I cursed them in turn
for not being fields of shade trees And as I
ran i looked at the corn, and after looking
hard at it for a mile or two my perspective
began to change. My boredom was giving
way once again to awe, but a different kind
of awe this time. one that bordered on the
recognition ot tragedy.

in every direction as tar as lcould see,
the corn was brown. And I began to
remember what I'd heard only ﬂeetingly
at home in Minnesota, and a great deal
here in Grinnell, concerning the drought
that has plagued lowa throughout the sums

I remember hearing someone say that so
far in the month of August, Iowa had had
24 days wiﬂi temperatures at or above 90
degrees, with virtually no precipitation.
And I knew that all the rain in Ute world
couldn‘t save a dying corn crop in me last
week of August.

”As goes the fate of its corn,
so goes the fate of Iowa’s

economy. And the corn is brown
this year. Very brown.”

 

Iowa’s corn crop was rated as ‘good'. The
rest was categorized as marginal to poor,
which means that perhaps as percent of
the state's potential corn crop will be non-
existenti And I remembered that Iowa's
governor Terry Branstad had declared

Iowa's corn crop a disaster, and had turn-
ed to the federal government {or help. And

In the opening paragraphs of his book
The Grapes of Wrath. John Steinbeck
describes the effects of an Oklahoma
drought on a crap on struggling corn:
“ ..The sun flared down on the growmg
corn day after day until a line of brown
spread alone the edge of each green
bayonet... And as the sharp sun struck day

after day, the leaves or the young corn
became less stiff and erect; they bent in a
curve at first, and then as the central rihs
of strenth grew weak. each leaf tilted
downward. . Then it was June, and the sun
shone more fiercely The brown lines on
the corn leaves widened and moved in on
the central ribs .'

a lost crop. even now in the era of big-

between shortages and gluts are often
blurred by the myopic vision of profits. So-
