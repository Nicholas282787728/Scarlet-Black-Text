Why Grinnell" Why is it that Grinneli is
the coolest, wildest, most exciting and in-
tellectually stimulating place within 2300
miles" Maybe it’s because nobody lives
within 2300 miles. Nope. many do. Maybe
it's because ot something in the air. Nope.
not pollution Maybe it’s in the curriculum.

. Naah My guess is that it's the people
who come here. Yeah. that's it ll 5 the

all of them. but the ones that aren't are
rarely ever seen. in tact. i don’t know any.

what can one say about weekend enters
tatninent at Gi‘innell’.’ One could say, " . .
exciting, spectacular, . . . never-
ending. Dld you ever wonder what words
these ellipses obliterate from reviews",
Perhaps it's tnot vel'yl exciting, that spans
tacular l boring andl neverending. Actuale
ly. Grinnell does otter numerous activities
that some people might [ind entertaining.
For example, there are reggae dances.
more reggae dances. and then on some
weekends they have reggae dances The
movies have been on the upswing in the
past lew years t am particularly looking
forward to Animal [louse 0n Gl’inncll
Relays weekend Usually the movies are
good- it you missed a movie tour or live
ye ago. you can see it at Grinncll next
yeai ti nothing else is planned. one can
always go to the Pub or to one of the many
downtown bars. or just get drunk with buds

Who once told Simon and Garfunkel. Bob
liylan. Bobby Darin and Tom Jones Why
the hubbub over studying" studying is just
one of those funny little things we all have
to do irom tune to time. like washing
clothes or cutting our toenails. The any
problem With this iunny little thing called
studying is that it consumes anywhere
from 50 to 90 percent of our waking hours
as students at Giinnell. That's a pretty
painful bile from such a funny little thing,
Just out or curiosity. leonducted a highly
unscientific Survey of some late-night
patrons oi the library and inquired as to
what they would rather be doing other than
studying A whopping 70 percent said they
would rather be spending a tuneillled day
at an amusement park. 23 percent said
they would rather he relaxing in their
rooms drinking a sti-oh's; and a severely
disturbed two percent said they would

prison [or drug smuggling That 70 percent
or Bul'ling's patrons pretei-red a day at an
amusement park to studying supports the
theory of a close, personal friend of mine
who once said. studying is like riding a
torus wheel you can do it over and over
and over again and never really get
anywliere' True. perhaps. but don't let
studying get you down Aiterall. it _iust a
lunny little thing

what I find most interesting about Grin
nell is that the best and worst aspects ol‘
the college both stem from Gl'innell's stze
and location. The small size and isolation
can make Gl'tnnell very claustrophobic
and sometimes seem like a prison.
Because you know everyone and everyone
certainly knows you. it is oltcn very dlr~
hcult to escape or to lmd iii-acy Bul at
the same tune. Grinncll‘s mall size and
isolation contribute to the Grinnellian
sense ot communil . riends and acqutillh
tances are easily made. It is yer . dill'ieiilt
to traicl anywhere on campus or in town
without running into a lucid. and it is
almost impossible to travel around the
campus and see an unfamiliar lace 't'his
smallness helps to create a closeness
among the students which sometimes
resembles that ol ti l‘aiinly
