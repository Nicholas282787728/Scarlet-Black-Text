FYC members bypass Joint Board to lead elsewhere

BY CHLOE MORVL
First Year CounCil (FYC) was originally created by SGA
President Megan Goering ’08 and Maggie

SGA Cabinet and the Executive Council
Students’ involvement with FYC still proved a valuable exr
pericnce said some members, In order to learn

 

Pothorr'os to provide opportunities for ﬁrst
years to assume leadership positions before
they were allowed to run for Joint board po-
sitions or be Student Advisors. It was hoped
that mcmbcrs ofFYC would eventually take on
these roles once they were eligible after the first
semester. These hopes have only been partially
realized, While FYC members remain active in
SGA committees, none ran in the most iecent
Joint Board election, instead deciding to con
tinue their work with FYC.

Goering said that the primary motive behind

 

about the inner workings of SGA, members
of FYC participated in SGA committees.
such as Dining Committee and Student En-
vironmental Committee (SEC). Students
on FYC also met with cabinet members to
give advice on how to navigate the adminisr
trarive landscape of the school by discussing
the respons’ iltties of SGA cabinet positions
and the logistics ofplanning major events at
Grinnell, .

“We had [ACE Chair] TJ [Hawley]
come in to talk to them about throwing a

 

 

the group was to incorporate first years into col-

lege leadership but also to prepare them for future participation
on Joint Board. “In particular, when we started it, it started out
ofa conversation that ﬁrst years couldn't run for Joint Board,"
said Goering. “The idea was to get rhern thinking about what
happens on campus and particularly to get them thinking about
working on SGA,"

Mairead O'Grady '10, who was a member ofFYC during
her ﬁrst year at Grinnell and new acts as corleader orrhe group
with Jacques Nguyen '10, said the council allowed ﬁrst-years
to get involved on campus despite being barred from holding
other mole traditional posi ons on campus. “We all thought
it's a good idea to get ﬁrstryears in leadership tolls before they
could run [or senator or be SAs," O'Grady said.

Celeste Larkin '11 and Bianca Silva '11 both members of
FYC, decided not to run for Joint Board despite being mem~
bets of the All Campus Events Committee (ACE).and Pub
committee, respectively “Personally, 1 want to reach out to
other groups and committees instead of running {or senate,"
said Silva.

While Goering said
that it was “interesting"
that none of this year’s
FYC participants mn
for Joint Board, their
members have gone on
to other leadership por
sitions on campus. “It
could be considered a
disappointment [that
nobody ran for Joint
Board], but [FYC has]
had a much broader imr
pact than we could have expected,"she said. Goering pointed to
former members holding leadership positions in the Voicebox,

”(trail/d be considered a disap—
pointment [nobody ran forjoint
Board] but [FYC has] had a
much broader impact than we
tau/d have expected.”

l—larris party," said O’Grady.

O’Grady said that the introduction to SGA committees
was an important experience for FYC members. “Megan [Gor
ering] contacted the committees for us to try to get the first
years involved," said O'Grady. “It's really a great way for them
to see where the money is going and what projects different

' committees are doing.”

FYC members said that the activities acquainted them with
more thanjust SGA bodies, “I became a lot more aware ofSEC
and [Free The Planet]," said Silva. “Being on FYC made me
more aware Ofother groups and committeesl think are imporr
tant or active, and you kind ofget a preview Oftliat," she said

Instead of applying their newfound knowledge to Joint
Board, FYC members have continued their work from last set
mester. They throw their ﬁrst Harris party this past Saturday
night, and O’Grady hopes to extend FYC to create a publica-
tion for the incoming first year class that would focus on the
particular experiences of new students “It's great to have all
these publications about the perspectives ofGrinnell students,“
said O'Grady “but I feel like it's really key to hear it from a ﬁrst
year during their first year at Grinnell."

FYC members said they hope to continue their work
throughout second semester. “We want to continue our in-
volvement with SGA the same that we have been," said Larkl'n.
"And ofcourse, throw more Harris parties," she grinned,
