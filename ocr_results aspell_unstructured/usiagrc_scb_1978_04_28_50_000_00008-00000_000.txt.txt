Sentimental journey: barhoppers do it again

Last spring the 5&3 ran a story
on rural bars in some of the Small
|0wns surrounding Grinnell The
response was so overwhelming
(and the research so much fun)
that we promised to do it again as
soon as the weather got nice,

Well, the weather finally got
nice, and we were thirsty and a

One step inside Bob's and you
know you‘re in a rural bar. There's
a group oi iarmers gathered
around a table up front playing

glasses and dollar bills decorate
the table. A sign proclaiming
“Hogs are Beautiful" dominates
the wall. Calendars from local
implement dealers and a couple of
paintings depicting rustic local
scenes also adorn the walls, Butch
informs us that the landscapes are
painted by Bob‘s daughter.

THE STOOLS at the bar read
“Grain Belt Beer," and bottles of
pickles, pickled gizzards, and eggs
line the bar. “The pickled eggs are
homemade." Butch tells us, but we
declined an invitation to Sample

Bob’s has a back room which
holds one of the oldest pool tables
we’ve ever seen, It's a mammoth
pocket pool table designed
especially ior snooker, A tattered

75 cents and is long remembered
afterwards. Service is quick and
friendly (“hi fellasl”), and there is
real class in the way hamburgers
are served—no plates, just waxed
paper. The burgers, by the way,
are delicious and cheap

The Dar-Mac is named for its
hospitable owners, Ned and
Darlene McCargar. They’ve been
running the bar for [our years and
seem to know everybody who
walks in. “You gradually get to
know folks.” Ned says, “Besides,
most of our customers are local
folks.”

THE Dar-Mac has a pleasant ii
unpretentious interior. A long bar
and lunch counter runs almost the
length oi the building and there are
a few wooden booths as well. The
booths are lit by some incongruous
green and orange lamps that look
like plastic reptile skins. They look
pretty strange, but somehow you
begin to accept them aiter a while.
The burgundy stools at the bar are
comfy.

At the bar, draws of Bud or
Schlitz are 30 cents. bottles oi thel
usual brands are 60 cents. Most

 

 

standard bar drinks are 70780
cents, and a few exotic ones run
higher. ch said that few ask for it,
but he does make a mean Moscow

vodka, crused ice and ginger beer,
it‘s thc most expensive drink in the
house, S150. “Haven't sold one in

Montezuma

The Monte Tap, by some
strange coincidence, is located in
Montezuma. county seat oi
Poweshlek County. It is owned and
operated by Mark Shearer. who
has presided over the activities

tlrst purchased the business it was

curtains which look suspiciously
like beach towels. One hasto get up
and wander about to see the real
decorating gems, though. Military
emblems and plaques representing
the Marines, the Navy and other
like organizations decorate the
walls

The garrulous owner provides
his customers with magazrnes loi-
their leisure moments in the
restrooms The Iowa Beverage
.louriial was a particular favorite,
but there are also copies oi such
periodicals as Glamour,
(‘osiiiopotitain and a car parts
catalog. Hair spray is also
provided in the ladies room.

merchandise, the rising rates oi

act, insurance, license, taxes, ect.
tsic) . . . it is necessary we have a
slight increase in the price ot our
merchandise." Mark must know
something about inflation because
the Sign has long since yellowed
with age,

But his prices are actually about
average. A draw of Bud costs four
hits, mixed drinks average 70
cents, and a goodssized pitcher
goes for two dollars, The usual
assortment of bar snacks are
available, and Mark can oc-
casionally be cajoled into the
preparation oi some hot iood

THE MONTE Tap takes its
character from its owner, which
means it is relaxed and friendly,
Mark, however, is prepared ior
any eventuality. A small billy club
hangs from a hook behind the bar.
It probably has quite a layer oi
dust on it, As Mark says, there are
“no girlie shows. no gamblin'.
Nothin'. Just beer and fun.”

Laurel

Laurel is a grainvelevator town
of about 500 residents located
eighteen miles northwest oi
Grinnell. To find this quaint hamlet
go north on Highway 146 through
Gilman, then head west on County
Road E67. Make a left on State
Highway 14 and you’re there,

To FIND the Sportsman's
Lounge, iollow the same direcn

Neither is the Sportsman's Lounge.
From the street, it is a small,
rather unappealing yellow brick
box oi a building. An innocuous
shingle announces: “Sportsman‘s
LoungkLunch,”

The bar, one of the coziest in the
area, is tucked away on the second
iloor. There are just a few tables

 

and only two booths. The single
room is also crammed with a pool
table, an imported i'oosball table,
and an uninspired pinball machine.

The bar counter seats about five,

The Sportsman's Lounge is a

It’s a good place to start off an
evening of extended hopping.

Haverhill

Haverhill is a tiny village ap

Grinnell near Jasper County high

is a scrupulously clean farming

BLUM'S is no iniicy place, they
don't even have a jukebox or pool
table, but it's a picturesque bar,
with plenty of \vitticisms tacked on
the walls. clean, oiled ' od floors,

in the way or alcoholic

beverages. they only serve bottled
beer and canned beer, There is no
tap beer (“too much trouble") or
hard liquor (“no liquor license")
available. However, Blum’s does
have a tiny kitchen and Evelyn
turns out some at the cheapest
hamburgers in the county-only 55
cents. Hours are uncertain, but
Evelyn assures us that they’re
always open by ‘3 a.m. and don’t
usually close until after 10 .m. or
whenever the last customer eaves.
HAVERHILL is one of those tiny
communities you would never
know existed unless someone told
you. The residents aren’t ac
customed to seeing too many
Strangeis, so we recommend that
Visitors be on their best behavior.
It's a lovely town and well worth a
visit, It you go during the day,stop
by the town church. It's the most
prominent ieature in the town.

It you tind yourseli wrth an
evening tree and means oi tran-
sportation, give one of these places
a try. There are a number of rural
bars around Grinncll and each has
its own special ambience to offer to
the adventurous Student who takes
the time to Search it out. Bob‘s
Place, the Dar»Mac, Blum’s, the
Sportsman’s Lounge and the Monte
Tap are nice places to Start, but the
best rural bars are always the ones
you iind yourself. Cheers.
