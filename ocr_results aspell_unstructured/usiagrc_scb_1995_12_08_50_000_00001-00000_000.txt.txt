selected through a lengthy prtr
cess ofstiirloni polling, Richards was
chosen froma list ofalmost 50 Candi»
dates for th is year’s Commencement
speaker According to Joino zimhr
‘96, member of the Senior \X/eek
committee, students initially re—
quested speakers ranging from Rich—
ard Parsons, the president ofTimc»
Warner, to Stephen Jay Gould, a
Harvard biologist, to Madonna. Zim—
bi says that "most of the candidates
were taken off the list because we
either couldn’t afford them or we
didn't have any [Grinnell affiliated]
contacts to them.”

The listwaseyentually narrowed
down to Richard Parsons, Stephen
Jay Gould, Charlie Rangel, a palm—
cian from New York city. vice Pres.
ident Al Gore and Ann Richards.
TheSeniorWeekCommittee,which
consists of six students, four to five
administrators,and fourto five facul<
ty members, was diVided over who to
pick, says zimbi. “The faculty meme
bets wanted an academic speaker,

er, and the administrators were open
to anyone,biithad budgetconcerns.“
Because,saysZlmbi,"polittcianscan't
accept money for their speaking ene
gagements, we gravitated towards
getting Al Gore or Ann Richards."
Gore was knocked out of the ninning
because he “couldn’t give us a firm
answer about whether he’d be there
in person.“

“Wewantetltogcisumeunewiih
ties to Grinnell, because of the imr
portance oicclcbratriig the Sesoiii.
centennial." says Ziinhi. Richards,
whose daughter went to Orinnell. is
also friends with a trustee, and was
ultimately chosen because of those
connections.

Elected in 1990, Richards served
as Governor of Texas until 1994.
when she was unseatetl by a conscr/
vative Republican candidate. A
staunch Democrat, Richards is re—
membered for her keynote address in
1988 at the Democratic National
Convention, in which shesaid, “Poor
George—he can'| help it, he was
bornwithasilverfoot in his mouth,"
referring to George Bush, then still a
candidate for the Presidency.

Before her election, Richards was
a social studies and history teacher,

High school, and attended Baylor
University on scholarship. She grad—
uated from Baylor in 1954, and went
on graduate school at the University
of Texas at ADustin, where she
earned a teaching certificate,

During her Governorship, Ri—
chartls appointed more African-
Americans, Hispanics, and women
to state posts than anyothcr prcVious
Texas governor. She was the second
woman governor after Miriam A,

”She’ll receive an honorary de.
gree at commencement," Zimbisays.
Known for her fiery speaking style,
Richards will “try to speak about the

Special meeting called to deal with
complaints about Dining Services

KATHARINE J AGER
STAFF WRITER

According to SGAminutesand
to a publtc letter written by SGA
President Ed Brands ‘96, relations
between students and dining servic<
es have been rocky, at best, lately,

Brands says that “atJoint Board
meetings, we’ve had an inordinate
number complaints about Dining
Services. .tve’ve heard complaints
about everything you could imag—
ine.“

Consequently Brands arranged
for a meetingWith Dave McConnell,
Director of Dinig Services, attended
by Alice Kellar, Vicepresident for
Human Resources, Brands himself,
andsix other students. The meeting,
on December 7, was one in which
McConnell would not be allowed to

speak, lsutonlyiistento the concerns
orstudents.

”We have many concerns With
Dining Services,"saysBtands,oneof
which has to do with McConnell’s
personal communication. “The fact
that he’s not the most flexible person
in the world is a problem, because it
leads to a perception among students
that he's not receptive. That results
in a breakdown ofcommunication,"
which is what the meeting hopes to
address, Brands says. The meeting
iormat was itselisuggested lw Kellar
in the hope that it would be more
effective for conveying the roles of
each party, “We can more easily
present our concerns this way [with
McConnell siIent]" says Brands,
“We’ll be presenting our concetns
both verbally and in written form,"
he says, “and it Willbe easier for Dave
McConnell to digest about a million

complaints at once without having
to respond to each one of them.”

Student concerns with Dining
Services range from lack of meals for
vegans to the lack ofa written policy
about what can and cannot happen
in the Dining Halls except for the
ban on political demonstrations.
Brands says that the group doesn‘t
“wantpolicy. Wewantwrittenguide-
lines,”

After winter break, the group

'will meet again with McConnell and

Keller, The group consisting ofSa-
rah Cook ‘97, Miles Stem ‘96, Becky
Fidelman, Ben Rodriguez ‘98, Yayoi
Suzuki ‘97, Aaron Gross ‘95, and
Brands, Will then receive “answers.
results, and potential actions to be
taken concerning our questions,”
Brands says, adding that “not all of
the problems we have with Dining
Services can be solved materially,”

dents will eat breakfast and lunch
with their institute professor, “We

al exercise, but also a chance for

and concerts by Wendy Werner ‘95.

Students will receive then read—

Students registered for interim
who do not plan to attend must sub-
mit a petition to the committee on
academic standing before winter
break, or they will receive a two
credit F. Students were supposed to
drop by November3rd. Petitions are
in Nollen House because the com«
miitee on academic standing hears
all late requests for drops.

Planning for the interim session
has been occurring since last spring.
Moyer spent last summer looking for
alums to teach interesting topics.
Professors in each department were
asked to recommend alums they
thought would be appropriate. Int
terim planners tried to pick a diverse
range oftopics that are not normally
included in the curriculum
