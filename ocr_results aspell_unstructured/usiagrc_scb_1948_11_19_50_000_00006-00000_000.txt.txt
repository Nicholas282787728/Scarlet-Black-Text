15 prep Mary Grimm beginning
to change Bob Green's bachelor
policy?

Thellman, Ward, Foege, and the
Norvets hagged an expensive bird
this week, we've been told, Is your.
bank night luch going to help pay
that $62.50. Foege?

Too much light reduced con»
sumption at last week's house par-
ties . . . last year‘s 58 knocked down
to 8/5ths.

Lucky that cash was fake Sat»
urday night; the house hauled in
368.000 at the little Reno in the
Women's gym.

Honor G, note! You're going to
have to go some to heat last week's
hall initiations, Fine performance,
especially from that Superman on
rollerskates.

It can't be true, what we've
heard. . . Women outnumber men
we to one (at "Passionnelle,"that
is).

At. last we've disbovered the rea-
son for last year's tuition boost . ,.
the student Union has a new deck,
of cards. Recreation facilities are
now available to all students... .‘

Seems as though June Greeulief
really caused an “alarm" a couple
at weeks ago.

Question of the week: 15 Topsy
Dewey to be Harry (alias Freud)
Fuiik's next subject for psychoan-l
alysis’! '
