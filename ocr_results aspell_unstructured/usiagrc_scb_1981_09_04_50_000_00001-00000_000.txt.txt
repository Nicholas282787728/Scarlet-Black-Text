Overcrowded conditions

hit Grinnell dorms
120 students directly affected

by Laura Carter

Overcrowded dormitories at Grinnell
have caused a shortage of standard room
turniture, the loss or private dining rooms
and a television lounge and the possibility
that some students may have to disrupt
their studies during the term to move. The
situation has also torced up to 22 “new
students" 7 freshmen, transfer and re.
admitted students — to begin their Grinnell
careers oft-campus.

The lack of furniture was brought to cams
pus attention by a memo circulated this
Week to resident advisers. This memo, ac-
cording to Haines and Read Halls R A. Nan
Robinson, informed R. A. s that a dresser
had been stolen from south campus and ask-
ed them to warn student advisers of the pro-
blem. Donna Savage, BA. for Younker and
Smith Halls, reported that one room in
North Younkers has, following the college‘s
specifications, inadequate dresser and desk
storage space. Students are using the bulky.
metal wardrobes to create the needed
space, she added,

Some of the people using this short supply
of furniture are living in what the Office of
Student Affairs terms “created space." Two
private dining rooms in Cowles Hall are
housing four freshmen and the Youkers Hall
television lounge has been converted into
two triple occupancy rooms ior freshmen
women.

Another 23 students are living in "uprated
rooms.“ These rooms include.f|ve singles
converted into doubles, three doubles now
housing triples and 15 rooms in which tour
people live in space designed for three.

Also added to Grinnell's residence capacir
(y is Haines Annex at 1208 East Street, This
house, purchased without Director of Stu»
dent Housing Bob TownerrLarsen's
knowledge, currently holds five freshmen
and one sophomore SA The building is cons
sidered part of Haines Hall and the number
of freshmen living in it should increase to
seven Within the next week.

Project and coop houses are accom-
modating six transfer students and the Stuc
dent Affairs Office is allowing nine Students
to stay in Grinnell House until Sept. 9 or un-
til they can find rooms in town, whichever
date comes first. “Because of the housing
shortage we had to house new students
first," Towner-Larsen said. "This is a bulr
ter zone while uiey're looking tor apart~
menbi”

The director of housing reported 120
students are directly affected by this comv
bination of created space, the addition at a
roommmate and Hie acquisition of Haines
Annex. However, Townerrlarsen admitted,
the number at people inconvenienced by the
lack of PDRs and a television lounge is
much greater.

The reasons for the overcrowding and in
conveniences. consist of four basic prob
lems. Towner-Larsen cited a higher enroll-
ment oi new students and a subsequent
“mistarget” on their numbers as ,the
primary cause. “The college actually
underadmitted compared to past years," he
said. But the difference came when more of
the admitted students accepted than usual.
By Aug. 1 this iigure stood at 430.

John Hopkins, director of Admissions and
Student Financial Aid, attributed the high
acceptance rate to the larger amount of aid
Grinnell allocates that "other schools
couldn‘t offer." And the Admissions Office's
ability to predict acceptance “some by
guess, some by gosh" added to the problem
in projecting the number of new students

Hopkins reported Aug. 31 that 418 new
students had arrived on campus, up irom
the figure of 410 he had expected. This
number includes 375 freshmen, 39 tramiers
and [our readmitted students, However,
Hopkins had established an cnilier target
goal oi 403 at a late June meeting ot Presi-
dent George Drake, Executive Vice-
President Waldo' Walker and Dean of Stun
dent Affairs Jim Tederman.

“By mierune," said Towner-Larsen and
Oda Callison, administrative assistant to
the vicerpresident and dean oi student Af-
iairs, “most new students were placed,"
Callison, who was in charge of freshmen
room placement, explained that open slots
were filled in the order that housing cards
and deposits came in. New students receivA
ed housing packets in June, Callison con-
tinued, and 55 to 70 were told the college
could not house them but this would pro-
bably change and they would be notiiied at
their housing status in early August

At the end oi July it looked as though at
least 40 students would be unable to get col
lege housing, TownerrLarsen added,
the first and second weeks oi August it
became obvious that we weren't going to
come under the 403 mark, even With attri~
tion."

“There weren't really any clear dates in
August," TownerrLarsen said. “We worked
to create space and uprate rooms as things
were created and as attrition occurred.”
The Student Affairs Office tried to avoid
creating space in “the worst situations that
atiectcd the most people," he said And
Callison reported the rooming situation was
still changing even as key pickup began

and then again, maybe

as the Younker Hall tale
sion lounge. The over-

reported to the iaculy meeting Aug. 31, "this
creates reduced capacity or ireedom ot
latitude.”

Another factor contributing to crowded
dorms is the smaller number of students llVr

ing offrcampus in the city oi Grinnell than in,

past years, In accordance with Grinnell's
aim to be a residential college, only 170
students are allowed to live in town. By
Sept 1 only 153 students had taken this ope
tion which meant it more students were be-
ing accommodated in the dorms than the ot-
lice ot Student Affairs had anticipated.

The iinal element ot the jumbled housing
situation is a lower attrition rate Although
this will not be gauged accurately until die
Admissions Office releases its Dean's
Report to the iaculty in October, the number
of students dropping out oi school or not
showing up has been lower than expected
For this reason, Walker told the iaculty.
”We are unable to determine attrition close-

ly.“

“We're in a holding pattern right now.

We’re just waiting for when

people decide to drop out.”

“This ‘mistarget' has proved to be the
most confusing of the four problems,"
Townerrlarsen said. But he added, “There
is no way to control it statistically,"

The next most significant. reason [or the
dorm overcrowding is the renovation of
Loose Hall. Because Loose will be closed
when Gates and Rawson Halls are finished
and the residents of those halls vacate their
temporary rooms in Loose, approximately
100 occupancy spaces will be lost. As Ex-
ecutive Vice-President Waldo Walker

Bob Townei-Larsen.

The reaction oi studeno placed in created
spaces, uprated rooms or houses because oi
these problems is mixed. “The Student Afr
iairs Office didn't tell us anything," said An-
drea straight, a resident oi South Younkers
Rec North room. "The first time we knew
this was a lounge was when someone came
in and told us." She has heard irom other
students, however, that she and her two
roommates and three women in the Rec
South room will not be moved "1 think
we're kind or low priority and people are
probably in worse rooms than ours."

David Mathias, who lives in one ol the
Cowles pore said, “l've grown iond ot it e
the dimmer light switches, carpet and
wallpaper." He reported his only contact
with Student Affairs personnel has been
through his R.A., Kino Ruth. ”He says we're
next on the list to get moved up and they
want to move both PDRs at the same timei
just wonder ll i should pack no“. or next
week."

chris Dobson, Mathias neighbor, round
he did not have a regular room assignment
when he iinally got impatient and called Stu-
dent Atiairs two weeks before New Student
Days. But he is not unhappy with his loca
tion in Cowles. "I like the location, it's not
noisy during study time and it has a cen-
tralized location,"

And Jay Lizotte, who rooms with Dobson.
has replaced his initial indifferent attitude
toward his housing situation with one ol
satisiaction, "i like it a lot and I’m going to
be really pissed if l havc to move my
trunk "

The students in Haines Annex will not be
moved onto campus this year Townerr
Larsen stated both Haines Annex and the
South Younker Rec rooms will remain
throughout the year. The men in the PDRs.
however, Will be moved into permanent
housing as soon as tour openings occur and
both rooms can be vacated at one time.
"We're in a holding pattern right'now," tie
said. “We‘re Just waiting for when people
decide to drop out ” But no room switches
will take place ior two weeks, unless they
concern students in overcrowded condi-
tions

"The most undesirable aspect of the tight
housing situation is the potential isolation at
new students," stated Towner-Larsen.
Rachel Druker, S.A. for Haines Annex.
agreed. “The freshmen feel very isolated
from campus life but they've made an effort
to be on campus." Druker. who was an S.A
alternate, was offered the job Aug. 1, “I've
had a lot of cooperation from B k G and $th
dent Affairs," she reported, "And Nan
Robinson, Haines and Read RA, has made
an effort too."
