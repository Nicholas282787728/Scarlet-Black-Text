A Gateway—Electrical

NLY a forty- foot gateway bounded

by two brick pilasters and orna~
niental lamps, but it is unlike any other
gateway in the entire world.

Fog back of it is the General Electric
Company’s main ofﬁce building, accom—
modating 2300 employees. And just
next door is its main laboratory with the
best equipment for testing, standardiz-
ing and researchlat the command of ca-
pable engineers. Then down the street a
mile longware other buildings where
electrical products are made by the
thousands of electrical Workers who
daily stream through.

merceh

General Ofﬁce

Through this gate messages and repre-
sentatives from a score of other factories '
and over ﬁfty branch ofﬁces come and
go every hourian endless chain of co-
ordinated activities carrying on and en-
larging the scope of over a quarter cen-
tury’s work for the betterment of
mankind.

What a story this gate would tell, if it
could, of the leaders of the electrical in-
dustly and of ambassadors from other
industries and institutions—and from' .
foreign lands. The story would be the
history of electric lighting, electric
transportation, electn'fled industrious
and electricity in the home.
