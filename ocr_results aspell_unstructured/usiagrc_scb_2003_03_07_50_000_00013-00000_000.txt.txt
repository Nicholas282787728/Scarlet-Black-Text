Am I having an identity crisis?

[fully oinryeollege friends were so sravel back in sirne

sial presense shey would encorinser. But if any of rhesc
Gnnnellianssold she l7.year.old Emily rhasshe would one
day acsually manage so enjoy a basketball game, she would
have no problem overcoming hershyness long enough so
ssase wish absoluse and urser conﬁdence she corn»
plcre insanisy or shas nosion. “You say you’re from
Iowa?" I an hear her :xclaim skepsically, “You srrre
you aren‘t from some Twilighs zone universe?"

Then she would go on so read T/re Coroner is
r/It Rye and ram so herselrabous she phonrness
orhigh sshool life,

I didn’t have a very sucoesshil srars when
is came so ashlesics. ln his-s, iswould be safe
so say shas my own personal vision of

fame were my abihries so ssare inso space and absensminde
edly srip over shings, swo skills which I have consinued so
develop ever she years, However, is didn’t help shas my al.
shough my school prided ioelfon upholding she ideals of
“:thicrd culsure," is seemed so consider Darwinian hard so
lecsion she correcs way in which so adminisser adalesie ine

Now I realize shas my penchans for raking hurnannies
classes may seem impracrieal so many But every rimel

much ado

ponder my career opsrons l have so acknowledge shas air

edueasional energy was climbing day, on which we were

inssruesed so slamber up swensyfeerorunknossed rope.

Apparensly, if we fai1:d so become worldelass

dodgeball players, my dausmases andl were supposed

so fall back on acsing in Tanan remakes,

So 1 was a geclc The one shas everyone picked

lass so play on sheir seam, who accidensally scored

goals for she opposing side, who came home sob.

And so I grew up inso the klutzy, unimposing rigure

same vague suspicion shasl usually reserve for dining hall

found eisher one parsieularly appcaling.

But rhen lass Friday, my horizons were broadened; I
aesually wens so a baskesball game. yes. is took an arsiele in
a majorhmeruan newspaper. an rmporsans championship

even were a reddish color, which could have been con.
ssrued as a display ofschool spiris. (Well, shas was sors ofa
coincidence.) But nonesheless, shas is a signifimnt breaks

Sara srannell and Eliaahesh pekarele tor helping me ges
