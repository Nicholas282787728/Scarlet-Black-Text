Ex-CIA Agent recounts his tragic story

By Patrizia Westtield

Verne Lyon Iowan, i,s,U.
graduate, aerospace engineer,
and ex—C.i.A. agent came to talk
to Grinnell students on April 4
about his “relationship with the
secret government of the United
States and the resulting conse
quences.”

The 60's became a time of tur-
bulence. It was during this time
that Lyon was a student at Iowa
State University and It-was during
this time that Lyon would make a
decision that would affect him for
the rest of his life.

Lyon was a senior at I.S,U, and
was getting a degree in aerospace
engineering a a field that was
very much in demand by the
government and by companies.

KDIC invaded by vandals

by Jeff Raymond

Approximately $300 worth of
equipment was stolen from the
Kch studio in Darby Gym-
nasium over Spring Break. and
Station Manager Ken Scotton is
concerned about security in the
gym-

Scotton said that he noticed last
Saturday afternoon that the front
door to the station was open anda
subsequent investigation of the of—
f ice revealed the theft of several
items. Missing were cartridges
from hoﬂi of the studio’s turns
tables. a microphone, tape carts
with public service an-
nouncements and promos, head-
phones and fifteen records from
the new releases collection,

Nothing has been found missing
from the large record library ac

cording to Scotton and the ether ,

items seem to have been stolen at
random. Scotton said that the
theft resembled an attack by van-
dals,

“It doesn’t seem to make a lot of
sense because people weren’t
stealing anything of value,” said
Scotton, “I don’t know if they
know it, but the cartridges they
Stole were for mono.”

The station has been operating

Lyon stated that he had received
many offers from various com-
panles. “Representatives" from a
company that Lyon had turned
down called and asked to See him.
Thinking they might be offering
more money, Lyon agreed to meet
with them. Part way through this
meeting, Lyon learned that they
were indeed representatives, but
for an entirely different emloyer,
They were men from the C.l.A.

According to Lyon, mey wanted
him to become a spy on campus.
He was to report on all antiwar
demonstrations, names of
dissidents, especially those who
were foreign. Lyon agreed and in
return he received $300 a month, a
guaranteed draft deferment, and

this week with a cartridge taken
from a turntable in the station’s
production room. Scotton said
that replacements for the stolen
property should arrive at the Sta-
tion within one month. The station
has no insurance to cover the
damage so the funds will have to
come out of the budget.

The station is scheduled to
undergo a renovation this sum-
mer, at which time a replacement
transmitter will be installed to
boost the station from its current
10 watts to 419 watts, According to
Scotton, there will be around
$20,000 worth of equipment at
KDIC after the renovation.

in light of this break-in, Scotton
said that the station would need
more security and insurance for
its property next year. He also
pointed to die theft ofa microcom-
puter from the Darby Terminal
Room last month as evidence of
lax security in the gym.

Scotton said that the station cur
rently cannot do much more to
prevent this type of incident in the
future. “I don’t know what else we
can do to prevent this from hap
pening again.” he said

Judco finds four guilty

by Jeff Raymond

Four students. Joe Kang. Tom
Hanseter, Kevin Murphy and
Charles Blomquist, were found
guilty ct various charges of van-
dalism and harrassment Wednes-
day night by the Judicial Council
(Judco). The Charges were filed
by the Norris Hall Council,

The charges apparently stem
from incidents going back to last
semester and came to an emo
tional head on Wednesday. The
proceedings took over three and
one-half hours to conclude.

As punishment for the harrasss
ment and vandalism charges,
Blomquist and Hanseter received
conduct probation recommenda»
tions and Murphy and Kang
received lighter conduct warning
recommendations, These recom
mendations will be sent for 3p,
proval to President George
Drake,

The four defendants, none of
Whom live in Norris. were accus-
ed of causing late-night disturs
bances and damage to the hall on
several occasions throughout the
year. All four pleaded not guilty to
the charges brought before them.

According to several members
of the Norris Hall Council. the
decision to bring the matter to
Judco was primarily an effort to
get the problem out or their hands
and into the jurisdiction of an im-
partial body

”We tried to the best of our
abilities'ito medlateﬁ" said Hall
President David‘ vLilienstein,
“More events happened and we

felt it was within our jurdisdictlon
to represent our dorm as we felt
responsible. In this case. at
Judco,”

Hall Council member Sandy
Raimondo said. “Norris Hall
Council brought this to Judicial
Council so that it would not be on
us to make any judgments on
anything that happened. , . We
wanted the whole thing out oi our
hands."

John Sbarbaro. who
represented the absent Blumquist
at the hearing, said, “They (the
defendants) didn't threaten
anybody. They banged on a lot of
doors and (the Norris Hall Couns
cil) called this harrassment.“

Sbarbaro also complained that
the case had not been first sent to
the Office of Community Rights
for mediation. Norris residents
said that they were given a list of
options by the Student Affairs of
{ice on how to pursue the matter
and taking it straight to .Iudco was
one of the suggestions.

At the beginning ot the hearing.
the defendants asked that Judco
member Clayton Parks not par-
ticipate in the hearing. Another
Judco mem ber. SGA Vice
President Pete Hautzinger. said
that Hanseter Said that he did not
mind whether Parks participated
in the hearings as long as he did
not vote. Parks did not cast a vote
in the deliberations.

Drake will review the recom»
mendations of the committee and
Wlll soon issue~the final measures
to be taken against the four

“on top of all that, the life of a
spy”

Prior to graduating, Lyon was
offered Officer training for the
CIA, but refused. He wanted his
degree in engineering and he
wanted to use it. Lyon then
accepted a position with the
McDonnel-Douglas Corporation in
St. Louis, He believed that his cons
nection with the C.l.A. was over.

Not too long into his employ-
ment. an antiswar demonstration
was held at the St. Louis airport.
During the rally a bomb exploded
destroying a bench and a window.
Lyon was accused of the crime,
but not arrested, McDonnel-
Douglas thought it best to give
him a leave of absence. Lyon
returned to Iowa where he was
immediately contacted by the
C.I,A, The recruiter told Lyon that
the accusation against him was a
mistake that could be corrected.
but meanwhile, the C.I.A. had an
offer, The era. wanted to place
him in Cuba, for two years, to
have him gather intelligence in»
formation for them.

Cuba needed someone with
Lyon's credentials and
background in engineering. Fidel
Castro had realized that
something had to be done to im-
prove the agricultural season,
because Cuba is without rain for
six months per year. Castro had
the idea of having rain artificially
made, He had everyone he needed
to produce the reactives and to
plant the crops. but he needed so-
meone to design a system that
would bring the reactives to the
clouds. Verne Lyon was that so
meone.

A dossier was prepared for
Lyon giving him the necessary
cover and background Since
Cuba did not have an embassy in
the U.S., it was necessary to ap-
proach them through represen-
tatives in Canada, Lyon was to
pose as an antlswar activist who
had fled to Canada and now
wanted to apply his knowledge to
construct something good for
humanity.

Lyon said it took a year for the
Cubans to verify his cover, but
that they “fell for it hook. line. and
sinker.” He was then given a job
in Cuba's Atmospheric Physics
Institute in the Cuban Academy of
Sciences In Havana. Lyon's Job
was to carry out the orders of the
C.l.A. (i.e. verifying names, ob-
taining iniormation. etc.).

Because it was necessary for
Lyon to conduct tests outside of
Havana, he received a car (a rare
commodity in Cuba). In this way.
he was free to come and go as he
chose, At one time, he was able to
give a stranded Russian techni-
cian a lift and from mat time on he
was accepted within the Russian
community. He was thus able to
obtain rattler secret information
to transmit to the CIA.

Lyon was to stay in Cuba for two
years and then get out. Towards
the end of this period. Lyon
received missions to manipulate
people. to poison milk and food
supplies of school children, and to
sabotage equipment, he said The
idea was to frustrate the average
Cuban Citizen. Said Lyon sar-
castically. “These things were
done in the best interest of the
United States.”

As a result of this double life.
Lyon said he became a person
who chainrsmoked. drank 'too
much, was nervous. constantly
looked over his shoulder and who
no longer knew his own motives.
Did he become friends Will! that
person because he wanted to know
the person or use the person?
Lyon just did not know

gwas a suggestion to divorce. Lyon

said, when Lyon refused. the
C.I.A, recommended that they exs
ploit his wife (Lyon’s wife's uncle
was one of Castro’s top twelve
men). When Lyon again refused.
the C.I.A, told him to renew his
contract and they could work on a
way to get his wife and himself
out. Lyon felt this to be the best
solution at the time.

Cuba was anxious to renew
Lyon's contract. for his work was
beginning to obtain results.
However. Cuba did not have all
the hardware that was needed so
Russia stepped in to help Lyon
was therefore able to fly to the
Soviet Union and obtain contracts
for supplies. he Sald.

Any information that Lyon
received was transmitted by a
radio operator, In this case. the
operator was a Mexican diplomat
who was First Secretary for
Cultural Affairs, The diplomat
would take the information and
convert it into high-speed
transmissions which were relayed
to the U.S. station in the Bahamas
called “Gabriel”. The diplomat
ws eventually caught and his
home was searched, and evidence
was found connecting Lyon to the
C.l.A.

Lyon said he was told by the
C.I.A. to cease all activities for six
months. At the end of this time he
resumed his intelligence gathers
ing activities Unbekncwnst to
him. Cuban countersintelligence
was watching him and did so for a
couple of years. In 1974 he was
finally arrested and Jailed. He
was to be tried before “Military
Tribunal No. l” which only handle
ed death sentence cases. After
thirty days in a small cell. Lyon
was very disoriented, he said. He
was brought before a firing squad
which proceeded to fire blanks.
Lyon was returned to his home in
Havana where he was later picked
up and put on a one way plane to
Jamaica. From there. he went to
Canada looking for political
asylum. The (act that the Cubans
had let Lyon go and had not ex-
ecuted him led the C] A. to
believe that he had told the
Cubans everything and was work
ing for them, he said.

Twice during Lyon's stay in
Canada. kidnapping attempts
were made by the C,l.A,. he said.
Lyon was eventually retuscd

asylum in Canada and had to look
for another country in which to
live. He chose Peru, and it had
diplomatic ties with Cuba which
could help gain the release of his
wife and son.

Once in Peru. however. Lyon
realized that another attempt to
kidnap him would be made. He
decided to ask the protection of
Sweden. but before they could
grant him asylum he was kidnap
ped and flown to Miami. There, he
was told that he was going to be
tried in St. Louis for the explosxon
that he had been accused of
twelve years previously.

At the trial. Lyon's lawyer ask~
ed that all the files relating to
Lyon within the C.I.A. be sub-
peonaed. The subpeona was
denied, he said. "for reasons of
National Security,” Lyon was
found guilty and was placed in
Leavenworth prison.

Talking about his experience in
prison Lyon said, “I wouldn't sit
with anyone and l walked with my
back to the wall. sideways down
the hall." The horror of prison life
had become evident when, on his
second day at Leavenworth, he
was confronted by a gang of five
prisoners in the shower room.
Picking up a mop handle. Lyon hit
the gang leader severing the
man's ear and with another blow.

Jaw. Lyon’s c,i,A, training helped
him deal with other incidents as
well. he said. “1 adopted the
philosophy‘of all prisoners » and
that is survival”, said Lyon. After
sixtyseight months in prison. he
was granted parole

Lyon concluded by saying that it
is necessary for u. S. citizens to
become involved and make sure
that the C,I.A,’s activities are
restricted to what the organiza-
tion is supposed to do.

He stressed that the people of
the US. have lost control of the
government and that tho control
must be gotten back by pressure
on Senators and representatives,

Lyon said that the CIA. had
become too influential in US.

tries' affairs and warned. "One of
