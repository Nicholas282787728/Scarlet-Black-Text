Oklahoma Aggies
After threatening all
show championship form, the Grin-
nell college basketball five came
through with a 26724 victory over the
Butler university Bulldogs, Missouri
valley leaders, here last night.

It was Butler’s second Valley de»
feat in the two years that the In-
dianapolis outfit has been in the con-
ference, the first being administered
by Creighton last year. The victory
places Grinnell iii a second place tie
with Creighton and Washington.

Davis Ineligible

Although missing the sterling Selh
vices of Davis, forward, who became
ineligible yesterday, and weary from
a weekend road trip which included
victories since Friday over Crinnell,
Drake and Creighton, the Butler
players still managed to display the
high caliber basketball which
marked their first game here Friday.

The Pioneers, while sinking one
less field goal than the Bulldogs,
playcd an alert dofcrisivc game and
checked the Butler sharp-shooters
hack of the scoring zone for the
most part. The nine Crinncll goals
come more as a result of individual
scoring than team play.

Tied at Half

At the half, the score was tied 11
to ll as the result of Simti's orie-
handed setup acquired while travel-
ing at full speed. The first period
opcned slowly. Bauer sank a long
shot from the sidc, followed by an
orgy of fouling in which six free
throws were caged, placing Griiiriell
ahead 5 to 3. A short shot by Mason,
