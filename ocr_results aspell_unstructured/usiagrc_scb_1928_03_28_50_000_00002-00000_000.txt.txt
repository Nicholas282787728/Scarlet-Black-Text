‘INTO THE OllLIl'ION 0F SILE; CE.

There is but one time in the career oi an editor when
he can unblushingly point the crooked finger of the car
low cynic to the upper lctt hand corner or his neuspaper
and say: "See what I (editorial we) have done!" That
particular occasion occurs with this issue, when the pres
ent editorial voice will twang its iinale and then sink
into the ohlirion oi silence, never again to he heard in
these pages.

Just one year from this issue we made some rash
statements concerning what we intended to do during our
term or office. shine at them we have attempted to
substantiate, some to live down, and some hare been
accomplished. We have tried to make the SCARLET

have succeeded in ii measure, which is a tact'and not
a boast.

Perhaps one o[ the first changes which came as a
direct result or an editorial was the rearrangement of
the college library. To claim the credit tor the new teler
phone system in the dormitories might be jumping on
the hand wagon, but we did advocate such a system.
'At a great loss of triends, we assisted in reducing “cuir
ting-in"_at varsity dances We early advocated changes
in women's hours at the quadrangle, which were intro~
duced this year. The editorials disturbed the faculty to
