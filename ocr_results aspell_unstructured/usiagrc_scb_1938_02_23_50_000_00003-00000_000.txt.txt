Meet Augustana
Tomorrow, Face
Monmouth Saturday

Emerging strongly from their
defeat by the Iowa State college
swimming team in a close 43 to 36
finish Saturday, the Pioneer mer-
mcn will meet Augustana and
Miiomouth colleges tomorrow and

- Saturday.

Both meets will be held in the
opponents' pools, the team leaving
here tomorrow noon to swim
against .Augustana at Rock Is—
land, 111., and then going to Gales—
burg to meet Monmouth Saturday
afternoon.

According to Coach Doyle Rey-
nolds, victories are quite probable
for the Pioneers since reported
times in the va ’ous events indi—
cate the greater scoring ability of
the local swimmers

In the Iowa state meet, Lam—
berson and Harris of Grinnell
placed first and second respective-
ly in the 60—yard freestyle.

quite possible that that will be
done for a large part of the
game. However. both Turnerend
Nash lack the experience neces-
sary to start plays competently
for the whole game. As a re-
sult, COnCapt‘dln LaMasncy and
Conn-ill will probably be called on
to take over the guard position at
intervals.

The chances are that Creighton

This may prove an advantage to
Grinnell. 0n the other bend, it is
an established fact that no inat-
ter how weak the Bluejays are,
they are a strong home team,
and quite frequently find them-
selves inspired when playing bee
fore the home crowd.

Gi-innelrs chief tactical prabr
leni will be keeping Creighton
from forcing the Pioneers into
playing Creighton’s game, rather
than their own. It is a triclr used
long and successfully by .Creigh-
ton teams.

End Intramural
Basketball Play
Saturday Afternoon

The final round of the men‘s ins
tramuial basketball tournament,
oiiginally scheduled tor last weele
end, was postponed until satur-
day, due to the Colonial Boll bc-
ing held in the men's gymnasium
last Saturday.

Going into the final round, Dibr
ble still maintains a clean slate in
both leagues. Clark A and B
teams are in second place, vith
only one defeat suffered at the
hands or the Dibblites.

In the final round Saturday,
Rawson meets Dibble in the
morning, while Langan opposes
Clark and Smith takes on Gates
in the afternoon.
\
from out past the free throw cir-
cle, the Scarletrclad men were
working their plays consistently
and effectively and that they were
scoring handily as a result. The
outlook for the rest of the season
is much brighter as long as Grin-
nell plays that sort of ball.

One of the prime factors in the
pioneer regeneration is Bob Berry,
who for two years now has been
steadily playing an ever more cons
sistent brand of ball without get—
ting any mention for it until now
he is as steady and consistent as
any man on the club. Essentially
a. team player, he is a great fac-
tor in holding the team together.

In spite or the fiwl: that the tall
guard doesn’t take many shots and,
consequently, is not a high scorer.
he is a mighty smooth ball player.

then only for very short periods.
His presence is indispensable, and
he rarely tires.
