Illusion and reality: the a'endiness of environmentalism

By Matthew Trager
Staff Columnist

A few weeks ago I was
pleased to read the results of
a poll conducred by Gallup,
CNN, and USA Today
showing that American citi»
zens consider “prorecrion of
the environment" to be an
issue ofgreat concern. Fur—
thering my delight, I read
on to discover that of those
polled, 70% indicated that
“protection of the environ
ment should be given prior»
ity, even at the risk ofcurbv
ing economic growth." A
recent Newsweek poll, re»
ported in the same source,
found that 61% of Ameri—
cans consider the environ»
ment to he a ”very impor»
ranr issue,” tying with taxes
and ranking
“America's role overseas.u

These numbers seem to
reﬂect well upon how we as
a country Feel about pro»
tecting those imperiled frag
ments of nature that we
have not yet destroyed. As
usual, though, the numbers
do not reveal the whole
story. How disturbed are
Americans by the increas»
ingly critical state ofthe lo—
cal, national, and global cn—
vironmcnt? Obviously con-
cerned enough to tell the
pollsters, but I believe that
there is often very little sub-
stance behind these feel-
good proclamations ofenvi-
ronmentalism. Sadly, car-
ing about the state of the
natural world has become a

above

fad for many Americans,
and a fad that is often limv
ited to a mere facade and
not necessarily reﬂected in
our actions.

It a majority of citizens
report their concern for en—
virorirnental issues, it is only
logical that politicians will
publicly espouse similar
views. on January 22 of
this year. I had the oppor—
tunity to question the ever—
charismatic CLW. Bush on
his environmenral position.
He replied that of course he
cared about li’zE state of the
natural world and told me
“lusr because I arn a Repub»
lican doesn’t mean I don't
care about clean air and
clean water.” Then again,
with CNN filming live,
what else could he say?

Bush was playing the en-
vironmental card to get
Votes, and a close look at his

'abysmal record in Texas

politics shows that this man,
who is vying for the most
powerful position in the
world, cares more for the in»
tercsrs ofmulrinational cor»
porations, big industries,
and oil companies than he
has ever cared about very
real environmental con—
cerns.

So, you might ask, does
any of this have anything to
do with Grinnell College?
After all, you say, we’re dif—
ferent, We have recycling
bins allover campus and we
use them. Many of us dc»
spisc big business, especially
big exploitative business.

‘And though a few orus caua

cused for Bush, most of us
supported Bradley, who
compiled an outstanding
84% environmenral voting
record during his time in
the Senate. These things
show that we care about the
environment and are acting
on our concerns, right?
'First, I suspect that if
Grinnellians were polled on
the above issucs, our te-

sponscs regarding the im-
portance of the environ-
ment would exceed the
numbers for the general
populace. After all, it is
trendy at Grinncll to care
about the'cnvironment.
Trendy or not, this is still a
good sign. However, just as
many of those polled prob-
ably drive gas—guzzling
SUVs, recycle irregularly i
at all, and engage in other
environmentally unfriendly
practices, I think that many
Grinnellians also do little
more than pay lip service to
environmental protection.

Grinnell College will be
faced with choices in the
coming months and years
that will affect this school
for decades (yes, I’m talking
about the Master Plan).
The Mastct Plan consult-
ants and the collcgc admin-
istration claim that they
want new buildings to be
environmentally friendly
and incorporate sustainable
design. In President Russell
K. Osgood’s presentation 0
the Plan he mentioned such
issues, if only as a rather
noncommittal blurp at the
end of the convocation.
Talk is simply not enough i
it is not accompanied by ac-
tion.

Picture the cover of the
2004 Gtinnell College
vicwboolc with a picture 0
a wind turbine that gener»
ates most of the power that
the college requires or a new
campus building that is
truly “green” in name and in
reality. Such advancements
are within the means of the
college and would represent
a true commitment on the
part of the administration
to environmental concerns.
We must not settle for less
than we can achieve, and
what we can achieve is great.
