Inter-Academic Debate with Iowa Wesleyan, Tonight

 

A Fi-ri BETA KAPPA SCHOOL‘)

Grinnell May Becamca Mcmbcr of the
National Honor Organization.—
Means Much to ihc School.

Apropos of the {act that Grinnell
has been recognized by the society‘s
authorities as a. possible new member
oi tlzeNational Phi Beta Kappa. Socie»
ry, we give herewith the iacts con-
cerning the society audcur school’s
candidacy:

The society or l’hi Beta Kappa. was
organized in 1771) at the College of
William and Mary at “’llliasmhurg.
Pa. IL was at ﬁrst a lit
harmed by the young men or the col-

ry society

logo, which soon spread to other col-

leges, with an athliaLion such as e ts
today. There are now over lilty
united chapters found in the best
colleges and universities of the Unit-
stl States These are governed by a
National Council and a Senate, Each
new chapter must obtain a charter
from the Senate which is i'Ittilled by
the National Council at. the next
meeting.

Tile Society or Phi Beta Kappa has
come to be the most honored of all
suc‘n so cries in the United States
owing to the fact that election to (his
societyriepends on scholarship grade
and standing Its ranks have been
ﬁlled up from Lhe best scholars of our
higher class colleges and universities
and it, boasts more distinguished
members than any other such Dlgr’ulr
iratiall, For a college to obtain a
chapter in Pllr Beta Kappa means
that its Standard of scholarship is
high. its work thorough and its place
among educational institutions nEar
the top, Selections ior membership
inacliapterare made by the iaculty
oi the institution.

Grinnell's application iota charter
has been acted upon favorably by the
Senate and Will he voted upon by the
Councilatits next mectingin about
six months The Senate Voted unalllr
mouslyio recommend to the Council
that loud College should be granted
a charter in the Society,
practically cquiraleilt to its helm:
obiained. Membership in this chapt-
er Will not be restricted to present
Students.

That Grinnell should riceire this
honor means much. Only one other
institution in the state, the State
University at Iowa City, has a chapt
er at this time. It is a widespread
recognition of our standing among
other institutions of leai'nlrg inthe
ULited States.

WOODROW is APPOINTED.

Drake Man is Chosen by the State Comr
mittcc to Receive ihc Riiodcs
Scholarship tor this Year.

(Mord will receiieasamplc product

your. There isllttle doubt but that
She will be its well pleased with this
one as the others (or nothing is heard
in raga .l to the decision but that, it
was in favor oi {in exocllnnt man.
Though Iowa College would have been
glad to send another representative
across the water, she is sure that the
honor will not be uiiappreciateri in
the place it has been besLowed.

The state rommittee rnetat iowa
City on Thursday and iiiiirally decitlr
ed that Jay Woodrow of Drakcwas
the man to receive the Rhodes
scholarship. Ii W. ()1de was tlia
other applicant, bothhaving success
fully taken the preliminary examina-
tions The decision Wasinude :Is the
result of two lacts not connected With
scholarship, rot in this and the other
iiualilrcations the men were about
equally deserving. Woodrow is an
older man than Clack and further
more, Griiineli has already sent one
man to Oxford. These considerations
were enough to throw the decision to
the man from Des Vlo‘ines.

Since the responsions once passed
are in force for rill time, Mr. Clack is
eligible to appear heroic the commltr
tee again liexl} year and lies candi-
date This he expects to do, since he
will return to Grinneli next fall and
take postgraduate work. All we can
do is say the choice was just and hope

for better success next, year.
