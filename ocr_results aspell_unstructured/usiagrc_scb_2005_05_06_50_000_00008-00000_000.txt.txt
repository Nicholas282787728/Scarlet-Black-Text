In the beginning, self-governance

Alright, I've gone to the source itself, one
of the major actors in instating self-gover-
nance at thrs college (at least, according to
Tom Crady), )im Tedcrman, Tederman was
hired as an RLC in the late 19605, and was
Dean of Students for much of the 19805.

I emailed him a few questions about
self—governance and he was kind
enough to respond in depth. So,
here’s what he said (in my words,
of course).

Grinnell changed very
raprdly rn the “dos and “70s
as did many other college. 7’
Grinneil went from “single
sex campuses, to every other
dorm being male or female,
to coed by alternating floors,
to coed by alternating rooms in .about four
years." Also, faculty had previously been very
involved in student life. Thcy served as advie
sors to student groups and had the “primary
authority" in student social and judicial policy.
But then, in Tcdcrman’s words, “the revolution

problems revolved around—

which “sometimes got out

neil did not mm to anarchy
as some had feared it would. He also believes
that, for the most part, about 5 percent ofthe
students caused about 95 percent percent of the
problems and that it is better for the adminis-
tration to allow students to have the ‘respon-
sibilities and freedoms of adulthood' and to

Being close to the cam-
pus is good, as it gets harder
to make the dangerous trek
across Highway 6 as you
get older. Or you may pre~
fer neighboring McNally’s,
Village Laundry, or The
Pub. Make sure you have nice neighbors who
will let you borrow a cup ofsugar or whatever
it is that you kids borrow nowadays.

Prestige: People will raise an eyebrow
in appreciation (or concern) if you tell them
you live in The Slum, Pastel Hcll, or Chastity
Manor.

If it’s important to you that people know
your house by name and reputation, you may
want to check in to one of the above presti-
gious Grinnell institutions, or the host ofoth-
ers that litter the blocks around campus.

Special features: some locations have
unique characteristics that draw tenants like
procrastinators to the Forum. Do you want
high ceilings? A big front porch? Stained-
glass windows? Sunshine? A basement that
doesn't look rhe Blair Witch Project? Many
Grinnell rental properties have such features
that give them their own charm.

orcourse, some have special teatures that
are negative, like extreme proximity to the
railroad tracks or ugly green shag carpeting

hands 0/ sweating like an
intramural basketball player Okay,
maybe some things less tondutive.

Size: How many people
can fit into this shithole?
Keep in mind that the more
housemates you have, the
lower rent will be. If you
don't mind sharing your room with one or two
people, and your bathroom with six or erght,
you could get a really good deal. Oh yeah, and
if you‘ll be off the meal plan, make sure your
kitchen is larger than a postage stamp.

’Malcs: Speakrng of sharing your house,
make sure to coordinate with your house/
apartment/room mates just like you would if
you were living on campus, only more.

Because you have to coordinate rcnt pay
ments and utility payments and summer subv
letting and who’s biinging what furniture and
who drank the last of the milk because you
can’t blame it on an anonymous kid down the
hall because no one else lives here damn it
and I know it was you and ifthcie aien’t some
fucking cornflakcs right here by the time I get
back from class 1 am seriously going to exert
cise some sclftgovcruancc on your ass.‘

Ifyou consider these simple factors, you’ll
be on your way to finding a place to call home
whether it be in Grinnell or anyavhcrc clse.

people challenged social
norms and faculty began to

withdraw from involvcmcnt in extracurricular
student life. Students wanted more authority
over theii personal lives and the faculty did not
wish to fight them on the issue—many faculty
evcn supported the students.

The initial idea of sclfsgovernance came
from the students themselves and some faculty
and administrators supported themThe Dean
of Students and the Office of Student Affairs
played the main role in working with the sure
dents. However. he did say that the changes in
the role of student governance in the college
were primarily faculty decisions.

I‘m not entirely sure where the students
got the idea for selﬂgovernance. It was prob
ably related to larger social processes at the
time, such as a strong anti-authoritarian ar-
titude, illegal drug use and the general reels
ing that if they were going to bc drafted at
the age of 18, they should be treated as adults
with firll selftdetermination. Students did not
model the Grinneil system after those of other
schools because most other schools dld not use
such a system. In fact, when Todcrman met
with cleans ofother colleges and explained the
system to them, they iesponded with “scorn or
outrrght hostility," felt he was being ir-rcspons
siblc, and would not believe the system actir

and punish the 95 percent.

However, faculty and
staff should have some say in the way the col-
lege is governed.Tederman frrmly believes that
the purpose or a small liberal arts concgc is
to provide its students with an education and
that purpose must not be lost amid discus*
sion of seif-goveinance. Incidents that occur
outside the classroom, especially on a residcns
tial campus. have a direct effect on how well
students can take advantage of the academics
here. Faculty and startshould primarily be con-
cerned with promoting an environement which
allows students to be academically successful,
Thus, they must have a voice in developing stus
tlcnt social policrcs and regulations. Tedcrman
strongly believes that every policy on campus
should be determined based solely on “how
[the] policy effects srrrdenrs' ability to be acas
dcmically successful at Gtrnneil College."

In Tedcrman’s view, the college should al-
ways bc struggling with how involved students
should be with the governing process and that
studcnts must realize that most faculty and
staff want them to be a part of it. However, they
want students to take their responsibility seri-
ously and “work in good faith towards mutual
goals.”If students can continue to do this, they
will always be able to play a role in governing
the college. '
