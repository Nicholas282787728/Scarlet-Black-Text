J. Brunius. Visiﬁng Professor,
Compares America, Sweden

By Jo Lennhllrdt

“Mommy, we have a buy that comes over the ocean to
school every morning.” said one 01' Stal'fan Bl'llnlus’s first
grade classmates. This is hardly the case, but J. A. Teddy

Brulllu his father
Uiiive lty of Um:

"I was amazed at the beautir
ful landscape. The land is not
nearly as flat as I axpcctcd, and
the colors are vivid and difr
fcrcnt trcm thosc in Sweden,”
said Brunitis who is here unr
dci- the auspices of tho Whit
ncy inundation and the Ful-
bright board

Training Ditlcrence
Brunius feels that many of

(lid “come UVCT the ocean” from the
‘l, Sweden, to spend a year as a visiting
professor of aesthetics iii the United State

the dlltercnces bctwacn Antenn-

can and Swedish students stem
from the difference in training

received in the high school and H

the gymnasiun‘t, A chdish stu-
dent is required to take three
or four iorcisn languages. They
can thus rclcr to original texts
in their studies and are train
ed to he more scholarly iioin
the beginning.

Although most at my Ameri-
can students lack a knowledge
of lacts that a Swedish stu-
dent would have,” commented
Brunius,’ it is a charming,
fresh experience to teach
them." He also stated that
the American student is more
inclined to take part in open
discussion than is the Swedish
student, who is often more
shy.

“Swedish students are closer
to research from the bcginning
because oi the curriculunr and
methods of teaching," said
Bl'unius. in Sweden 2 student
is more [ree in his studies He
is on his own to a much greater
extent than is thc American
studcnt. ldc attends lccturcs;pai>
ticipatas in seminars and when
he is rcady to bc lulled, he
tells the professor. The exam-
inatlon given is oral.

Moral Life Unregulated

Brunlus notcd that at Uppsala
there is no attempt to regulate
the moral life of a student. This
stems from the fact that many
of thc students are married, and
the univorsity does not fccl rd
saonsiblc for thclr moral cbn»
duct

“If you bchavc within certain
limits and pass your cxoms, you

‘Brunius

can stay.

The Swedish professor and
his lamily will go to another
11, 5. college next semester. The
tollowing slimmer, he will ran
turn to Swaden.

Brunius nevcr ceases to lie
astonishcd at one trait of the
American people. at every
ioreigncr they immediately,
ask --llow do you like Amer-
ica?" “In Sweden we would
ask an American about Amer-
ica ﬁrst.” He ﬁnds a “charm-
ing, but rather provincial" ctr
titudc held by Americans be»
cause so many of them are
amazed that ho would return
home alter being hercl

”chdcn is surprisingly very
much like America," rommcntcd
Brunins, who concluded that he
was amoying his stay and work
at Grinncll.

Adam Powell. Negro Demo-

much truth in the statement
that a vote for Stevenson is a
