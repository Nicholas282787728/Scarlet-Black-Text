The American girl occasions much
comment and discussion among her
ioreiizn sisters, but perhaps nothing in
her training causes such amazement
es the fact that, as a rule, iroru early
~ childhood she istrnsted to 20 to school
and come home unaccompanied by
maid, iootmao, or parent, and the
other fact that in school, she is inthe
slme classes with the boys of her own
age and degree of advancement, and
that her teachers may he either men or
women, no one cares particularly
which. provided they do their work
Well.

Probably a much larger proportion
of botll girls and boys attend tlle
Board schools in Scotland than else
where in Europe. llt must be
membered that "publlc schools” in
England do not correspond to our pub-
lic schools, but are endowed schools
governed by boards of trustees acting
in accordance with the terms of the

In England. as in France and Italy,
most, parents who can aiiord it preier
to send their daughters to private
schools. In England classlines are
strictly drawn: one frequently sees
advertisemeliks or schools ioi "gentle

addition, "deesmen's daughters not

Some years ago. I visited the Girls‘
High School in “'rirwlclr. held in the
house which “as once the home of
Walter Smage Lander. Despite the
name or the school, there were pupils
of all grades from tlle little maids in
the kindergarten to young women
ﬁtting [or the Universities.

University training for women is
stillon trial in England, One lady
told me that her chief Objection to
university women wasthat iltcl/ sumo

She seemed to think it a
required course, and I believe -all my
argumems failed to convince her that
cigarette smoking is not a badge oi
the higher education.

in France, many parents DbjeCttO
the national schools for their daugh-

ters, because oi the lack oi religious
instruction. Consequently tliedaugli»
ters of weiltordo parents are, to a
great extent educated in conventsrnr
private Protestant schools. Oi course.
those expecting to teach must attend
the government normal schools. Any
girl showing real ability is admitted
freely and cordially to any ooul'sesshe
wishes to take in the universities.
Frenchmen do not, as a rule, ask
wileiiiera piece of work is done by a
man or ii woman, but whether it

clearly marked, even tiiougii many of
the latter regard themselves as good
Catholics. In education asin every-
thing else, Italy‘is progressing stead-
ily. A larger number or well»todo
parents send their children to the
public schools in Italy then in either
France or England. One can not
help being impressed by the high
grade oi intelligence or the Italian
women oi the middle class, their
active interest in the progress or their
country, and their eager desire to
help those less iortunate than them-
selves. To read the little magazines

one a new respect ior tile womanhood

In Spain. the vast majority or girls
rec e their meager education inthe
convent schools. Two years ago some

better than the boy candidates irom
the government schools. Spain is
awakening by degrees.

Which system is best? All have
their good points. Observation and
acquaintance lead me to think that
the American way produces more
straigtiorward, clear thinking, self»
reliant women, on the whole quite as
”domestic” in their tastes as their
sisters in otliercountries. Yes, I am
sure I like the American girl best or
all, and next to her, the Italian.
