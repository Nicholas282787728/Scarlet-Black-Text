anyone is entitled to icel that now
is the time ior some competent
party to take some oi the boys
aside and appeal to their better

Spcaldng oi charm is remini—

seems that sweet Sally Rossman

And speaking oi charm again, we
must mention the most charming
thing that has sprouted around here
in many a moon, Bob “Gable" Moore's
mustache. Just like cable's picture oi
the same name, "it Happened One
Night” and next morning, Lo! There
was our Bob with a brand new tringe
on the old upper lip.

And that in turn reminds us
that Don ”Cagney” Kingery has

Kingery was pushing a tellow

Duke Credits Local Intramural Plan
for Popularity of Supervised Sports

Great Success of Informal
Physical Education
Due to System

To many who read it, the state.
menl made a few weeks ago that
nearly 35 per cent oi the men enroll—
ed at Grinnell college are pal‘ticipat.
ing in iiitormal physical education
was somewhat astounding,

'I\vu of the primary factors hack
of the surprising popularity of this
type oi physical training are Lester
Duke oi the college coaching stalt
and the system at intramural athletic
competition which he introduced in
1925.

’Gi-iimell was a pioneer in the adupr

schools in the country preceded Grin.
hell in taking Lhe step. the latter was
among the first schools of its size
and type to see the advantages of an
organized intra~durm program.

Ohio Slate, Originator

“Ohio State was the originator of
the system,” the Grinnell intramural
director stated in a recent interview,
“Michigan was next to adopt it and
has done much to popularize its use."

Until shortly before the world war
the present scheme of intramural
competition was unknown There were,
oi course, frequent unorganized games
between fraternities and residential
halls, but the competition was with.
out plan.

The necessity ior some sort oi pro.
grain to promote physical develop—
ment in the college was emphasized
by the multitude of men who were
found unfit for military service, and
it was probably this that brought
about the inlroducllon of intramural
competition. Added impetus was pro.
vided by the popularity oi the phy—
sical training periods that were a
part oi the regular training program
ill the army, Duke explained,

Few [ultra-Hall Gaines

Organized intramural games began
to gain in popularity shortly aiter
the war; most were in the nature
oi inter.class contesu, though there
was a limited amount of intra—hall
competition also. These games were
purely informal and no records oi
their outcome or participants are
available.

programs which he look at the Uni-
versity of Michigan aroused his great
interest and enthusiasm in the sub-
ject, which led to establishment of
the present. system in the {all of 1925.
The original program was much the
same as the one now iollowed, all
but three oi tho present sports being
included. Water polo and swimmllxg
were added iollowing completion oi
the college pool in 1929, and in 1333
half was included.

Early interest slight
Interest was comparatively slight at
iirst, participation being not nearly
so general as at. present. This is pin-t—
ly explainablc by the iact dirt athle.
lic material was concentrated in out:
or two halls For a number of
years the battle for the sweepsta‘rzs

stake championships before the dates
victory last year ended its reign,
Duke accredils three factors for
bringing about the increase in interest:
ﬁrst, that athletic ability in no longer
concentrated in any one or two halls;
second, the provision, introduced in
1930. permitting time spent in intra.
mural competition to be counted ior
physical trai ng credit; and totally,
the organization of the uitrtiuiuial
board in 1931, placing all questions
at policy directly in the hands oi the
men themselves. Such zl board. accord.
ing to Director Duke, is to be lound
in very icw colleges.

Equipment inadequate
“Lack of equipment is provtng a
very great handicap to the develop—
ment oi the intramural program,"
Duke declared, “II, has been wished
that competition might be held in
more sports, but until other iaeilities
are available the advancement of the
program is pretty much at a stand.
still,"

Among the sports which Duke wish.
as might be added are handball and
volleyball. “One‘- or two handball
courLs could be constructed in the
old heating plant at a very small
cost," he stated, “and I believe they
would prove very popular. As tor
volleyball, it might be added to the
fall program; it could be played on

 

days when no specttball contests are
scheduled."

The new tield house which, it is
hoped, may be built as a pait oi the
Grinncll Century oi Progress exten—
sion plans, would be or great value to
the intramural program, the director
avcrred. since it would make addi—
Lional gymnasium space and other
much.needed facilities available ior

ARTIC REGION (Special)7Thc Amalgamated order of
Sandy Claws Associations, Inc., has issued an edict dispensing
with the services of Kris Kringle, ala'ls Santa Claus, alais

St, Nicholas.

This radical organization insists that Kringle oiicrs too
much competition, and they fear that when they stand on
the corners beiore their tripods, ringing their bells, the pub»
he will not put in money because they feel that Kringle will
take care of them anyhow.

When interviewed regarding his discharge by the Scar—
let and Black correspondent he refused to comment other than

to say:

”Since the disposal of Christmas gifts will not be under
my direction this year, I recommend that. the students of
Gl‘ll‘lnEll college do their Christmas shopping at the Grinncll
stores for they won’t have time after they arrive home for

the vacation.

I have given these stores my complete line of

gifts, and they are equipped in every way to take care of the
rush. They have always worked with me, and I know that
they will be willing to cooperate in every way to make up

for my absence.

You will appreciate the gill. suggesiions

that. they will make for you.”
