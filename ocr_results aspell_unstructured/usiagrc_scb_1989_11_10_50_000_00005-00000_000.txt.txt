Our Fight Wasn’t Vicious — The S & B Was

 

To the Editor:

We would like to clarify our posi-
tion in the incident reported in The
Scarlet andBlack on Nov. 3 ("Police
Charge 5 Students in Connection
With Attack").

We feel the article was sensation-

Ragging On JtidCo

To the Editor:

1 am responding to Josh Burke’s
lettercondemningtheiudicialCoun-
cil for the “very reprehensible" ac-
tionslakenwhenitsupposedlyclosed
the hearing on Mike Kent and Stu-
dents Against Hippies on Sunday,
Oct 29 (“Open Up Judicial Council
Hearings," Nov. 3).

If the council had actually made
the decision to close the hearing, it
would have indeed been reprehen-
sible, for according to Section 11,
Part A of the Judicial Council by-
laws: “All hearings shall be open
except at the request of the defen-
dant or complainant to have the
hearing closed."

Judicial Council was in no way
responsible for closing the hearing.

U5. Pan Am airlines is ﬁling claims that Israeli

alized and improperly characterized
our involvement.‘

First. we want to make itclear that
we did notinstigate the incident. Our
involvementbegan once we realized
Grinnell rcsidens had threatened
physical violence against Ara Bul<
bulian. Yes, we could have walked
away but a friend was being threat
ened by several residents (including
one with a tworby-four) and given
these circumstances we did not feel
leaving Ara was an option.

Second, we want to make it clear
that we were in no way involved
with'the knifing. We do nct know
why Shahzad Ahmad pulled out the
knife and did not see the kniﬁng
occur. We were in no way defending
Ahmad‘s actions but tried to keep
the conﬂict between Ahmad and the
Grinnell residents from escalating
by persuading the Grinnell residents
not to go to campus and look for
Ahmad. We also offered to help the
knifed Victim. Dennis Moore, get to
the hospital if he wanted to.

Third, the knifing was vicious but
our involvement can no way be clasa
siﬁedasa“viciousback-alley brawl.”
We threw no punches and ended the
incident by shaking hands and ex-

changing phone numbers with the
Grinnell residents.

We are extremely disappoinmd
with the way The Scarlet and Black
reported the incident and how it was
handled by the college and the
community.

Given thecurrentlension between
Grinnell residents and students we
did what we felt was right and
avoided what easily could have
turned into “a vicious back-alley
brawl.”

We hope further confrontations
between students and Grinnell resi-
dents can be avoided.
