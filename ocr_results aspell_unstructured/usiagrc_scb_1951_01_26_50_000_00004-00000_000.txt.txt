Frosh Defea’r
Simpson 44-38

Team play was the key to vic—
tory as Grinnell swept past a
fast breaking Simpson five 44-38
last Saturday at Indianola.

Never behind, the Pioneers
controlled both backboards and
that proved to be the margin of
victory. Bob Winter and John
Young were outstanding in this
department Winters also became
the game’s high scorer With 11
points. Don Hager bucketed lo,
and Tom Railsback '7.

The Pioneers played great de»
fensive ball to hold Simpson to
18% of their shots, The Pioneers
practically doubled this with a
33 scoring per centage.

Marv Clein who departs to
serve Uncle Sam Monday was
largely responsible for the unity
of team play. Ciein consistently
engineered many of the team’s
scoring opportunities with his
effective passing and ban hand-
ling.
