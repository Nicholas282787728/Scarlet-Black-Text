“[Wilco] puts
on a really good
show,” said Jet-
cmy Lundquist
’99, “When I’ve
seen them live,
they have been
very energetic."

Lundquist;
who has already
attended three
Wilco concerts,
had planned to
drive to Chicago
to see the band a
fourth time this
weekend before
he learned they
would play at
Grinnell. “It’s
strange that
rhey‘re playing
here. i'm still not
quite believing
it," said
Lundquist,

Indeed, set»
endipity had
much to do with the contract that se-

- cured the Harris performance. Ac-

cording to SGA Concerts Chair An-
drew Ettenhofer too, Wilco had not
been on the original slate ofpetfotm—
ers.

“lsefore spring break, we had po—
tentially booked Liz Phair, and we
were just waiting for the contracts.
But right after spring break, we
[learned] she had cancelled her last
three tour dates, including ours," said
Ettcnhofct.

immediately, ettenhofer took to
the telephone to call a number of
bookingagents, including Kevin Daly
from Monterey Peninsula Artists. The
phone calls soon landed him a new
lisr otpotenrial performers. including
the Cranberries, Medeski Martin and
Wood, Elliot Smith, and Macco
Parker.

Wiles—recommended by Daly—

was also on the list. However,
Ertenhofer had initially believed that
securing Wilco would be impossible,
since the band was booked in chi.
cago on both Friday and Saturday
night. Bringing them to play
Gtinnell on a weeknight, said
Ertenhofer, would not be feasible.

on the verge of settling for a
scaled.back Elliot Smith (the back-up
band would not be able to attend),
Ettenhofer suddenly got a call from
Daly,

“He said that thco had cancelled
one of their dates in Chicagn,” said
Errenhoter, “So now theyd be nvnils
able on Saturday."

He booked the band. soon after,

For the ﬁnal project, the students
l<etl together in groups ofrlrrce or

ect was required ro meet certain
tmctcrs. For instance, each project
to include at least one rrmobased
linm such as video, animation, or

ts were give-n a good deal ofcres
freedom. said Chenette oi‘rhe

ects, “They've slowly been com.

ing together over the past few
months." ,

One of the projects, entitled
"Mental Maps,” follows five charac»
ters through the their evctydayactivi»
ties. Four ofrhe characters have spc.
crfrc mental disorders, while the ﬁfth
character is considered psychologically
normal. Allison Novak ’or is one of
the students producing the “Mental
Maps" project. “i rook a class at
Haverford College,” said Novak,
“The profwas really excited about the
web as an analogy for the human
mind," using this asnstarting point,
Novak and her partners try to use
web.based media to convey various
mental states.

Nathan White “00 is working on
a different project crypticallyentirled
"Proiect x." said White, “it's excite
ing to have a class there looking at
the realm ofeligitnl art." He enjoys
the fact that wcb-drt is an uncrglng

ofproblcms. “Sometirnuswostrnggle

“The technical difficulties can make
the process a lot harder." Even so, he
enjoys doing the work. “it’s a lot of

fun.“

So far, Professor Chenette has
been impressed with his students
work. “They all surprised me," he
said. Chenette had shown the stus
dents samples ofworlr frorn lastyear's
class, and was worried that this year’s
students would rise the same ideas.
but instead, “theyall chose different
paths," said Chenertc. He also con.
