AT LAST!

.The issue of student government has been' decidcd.
With the offi 'al sanctioning of the house unit pla by
President Main we enter into a new era in the history
at Grinnell men's community life. Some are doubtless
dissatisfied with the result or the government contro
versy, and feel that they have valid objections to the unit
plan. We feel, however, that these men will be wrlling
to give it a fair trial, for their final concern is not the
success of it particular form of government, but of airy
form that will make operative the principles or Grinuell
in the lives of the men.

It should bc remembered that the essence of house
unit orcr-urnent - illrlrr‘idi‘l and group of res
sponsibiliL (ire t pow-o , dui' s, and sci-rises are err-
ti ~ed to each building. “Solve the problems of the
men within their ironies, and no problems will remain
to be solved cl “here.” This rs the statement of pride
ciplc upon uhiclr the system is based, It is ca , to see
from such .t Sldtcllleui. tho nature of the responsibility
placed upon the house, and the men.

Two propositions wc strongly urge ripoir the men
of Grinnell: Fl that they accept the new plan whole
heartedly. in order to sire it the fair trial it dcscr cs;
second, that they concentrate on the development wlthru
their respective buildings of a lilgli sense of respmlsir
h This involves thc selection of the best nrcir in the
building to servc on the House Council. an highly capable

lion to be of as , aricc.

We feel that the new type of government has in it
the esselliidl elements for building men. It recognizes
that the house niiit is huth structurally and normally
the center 01' lite. lt affirms a steadfast belief in the

of college men to solve their ultimate social prob-
lems constructive! That is the ideal of Grinrrcil working
on a practical basis.

The Undergraduate Speakers' Exchange, a plan for
exchanging student thought among colleges and designed
to occupy the place formerly held by debating on the
G nrlell campus, has more than equaled expectations in
its inaugural year, About a month ago tour student
spealre eccived most cordial welcomes on the campuses
of thirteen colleges and universities, including the lollouu
irig: The Univc 'ties of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota,

and Macalester College

_ At several oi the e schools the spcal rs addr-e sed
strident meetings. At others the visit was made pill-cl~
to learn of campus problems. Faculty and students al e
approved heartily of the plan, and threw open the doors
of hospitality. Grlmlell speakers were thus able to brush
away the conventional barriers usually ilttcntlant upon
treading strange soil, and they could talk frankly and
openly with campus leaders about their mutual problems.
rorniaiities and plcasnntrrcs were dispcirscd in h; facts
were given their true color, whether pleasirrit or not: a
unique and profitable type of experience was obtained.

As the results or this project become available to the.

Grimiell campus, and are utilized in the solution of Grill
riell problems, the Undergraduate Sheakers' Exchange
will have delilonstmted its feasibility. The speakers H114
on this occasion assumed the role of enrlssaries of the
Grinnell student body, to collect information which might
become uselul.r It is felt that such a plan operates to
place forensic abilities and activities at the disposal of
the larger interests of the eritlre college community.

is l the Exchange speakers will soon have presented
in chapel the results of their findings, In addition a
composite report in detail of thc investigation will be
compiled, and made available for general use throughout
the country.

Tire Exchange has made its debut, creditably, it is
hoped, to Grinllell college. Usefulness in further g (or-
ellsic and campus interests should remain the criterion
of its success,
