Job‘ Demand
Brings S’rar’r
Oi Work Pool

With approximately 210 jobs ‘
already assigned, 80 students
are still waiting for employ-
ment, Dean of Men H’enry.A.
Brown announced this week.

Although selections have
not been made for all 1105i-
tions, many of the :0 remain
ing students will be placed in '
a work pool. This group will
periorm the work that various
departments of the couege
rind necessary during the
year and for which they have
insufficient help.

Lack of jobs available on
campus will result in a more
thorough examination of the
relative. need of students ap—
plying and in more critical
rating of student employees,
Brown stated.

He added that “the great
demand for jobs and the
smallness of the campus makes
it possible to give employ<
ment only to students who
must work to pay for their
education. Furthermore, any
studenu who obtain jobs and
show lack of initiative or
punctuality will lose their po-
sitions and be ineligible for
employment during the rest
.of their college career."

The Dean of Men’s oifice also
announced that the college paid
a total of $50,000 in student
employment last year. Student
pay rates range from 50 to 65
cents an hour, depending on
length of employment.
