By Additions From
1918 Squad.

Prospects for a winning tootball
team in 1915 are exceedingly bright,
as only iour ot the present varsity-
squad will leave school through gradir
ation, and the abundance of good mac
term in this year's Freshman class
ought to bring the lorgcst number oi
men out for re it tootball next sour
son in recent yea

The past season has been most un-
siieccssriil irom the point oi riew ot
the games won and lost. Up to today's
game, Griunell has scored but two
touchdowns during- the season, Lean-

The iact that much or (lie material
in this year‘s ra . ty squad ls Cum?
paratii-ely row, is probably one of the
reasons tor the uiisiicccsslul season.
Only three ot' the members oi the team
hare had prciioiis experience in HIV
sity iootball, and con'serpicnily there
was no solid nciicleiis around which
to build a winning team ,

The pictures showed in detail the

caused the canal-makers so much
liouble, were tin-own on the screen.

trip through the canal last August
were shown. .
