The harp recital given by Signor
Alberto Salvi, the renowned harp Vil's
tuoso, at Her-lick chapel Friday night
was one of the most unique perform.
shoes which the School of Music Re-
cital Course has been able to otter.

Signor Salvi. while hampered by the
limited range of his instrument, and
by the fact that few masterpieces have
been composed for the harp because of
its limitations, gave a most effective
and interesting program.

lleclumicul Defects mulmlzell.

The mechanical defects of the harp
which are a tendency for the strings
to break and for the instrument to
get out of tune were minimized by the
skill of the artist,

The beauty of the harp itseli, and
the novelty of seeing it separated from
a group, with the charm and uniquce
ness of tone, added greatly to the
interest. while the tune or the harp
is not as satisfying nor the range as
wide as either the violin or piano, the
color and contrast given by the great
virtuoso counterbalanced these dev
iccts.

Delit‘utc TOHCS Effective.

Generally speaking the delicate tones
were more elfectivc than the heavie
ones, due to the naturc oi the lllstrur
ment. The Walse de Concert which
was the only number of his own com»
position tnat Signor Saivi gave was
exceptionally well received, its
rhythm and spirit were infectious. .

The ﬁrst number, Concert Fantasia.
