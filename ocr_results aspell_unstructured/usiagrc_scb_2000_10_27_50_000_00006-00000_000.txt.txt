How could having a
single be bad? You
could stay up as late
as you want. You
could blow-dry your
hair at ridiculous
hours. And if it
weren’t for space
constraints, you could
even walk around
naked (and as it is you
can Still stand around
naked and maybe wave
your arms, if you don’t
live in a Rawson cell).
Most importantly, you
could have a private
space in which you
and your intimate
partner can bicker.

However, as my
junior fn'ends tell me,
there is a downside.
Without a roommate,
you lose a companion,
a conﬁdant, and, most
importantly, something
to whine about (" and
I walked in and she
was standing there
naked and waving his
arms aroun ..

Without a roommate,
you become Lonely.

Bernd Klosterfelde, a
middle-aged German
man, was tired of
living a lonely, single
life alone. Instead of
doing something
practical like finding a
roommate or ending
his life, Klostertelde
made a CD called Me
MehrAllein (Alone No
More). This CD is a
compilation of familiar
household sounds that,
when played, gives the
illusion that someone
loves you enough to
live with you. Tracks
include " Putting the
Weekly Shopping
Away”, "rry a Roast
Beef in a Fan”, and " A
Hastily Ironed Shirt”.

The CD serves two
purposes. The ﬁrst is
to make you feel less
lonely. The second
purpose (illustrated
well by track 11: “A
Quick Run Round with
the Vacuum" ) is to
remind you that living
with other is trying at
times. "Sometimes
you want to be
annoyed so you can
justiry your choice to
live alone."
Klostertelde said.

So grab the
American version of
the CD comes out in
February. It might not
have a few tracks that
pertain to your
roommates of
yesteryear (such as
"Feverlshly ryping
Sociology Final At Four
in the Morning with
the Lights on"), it
might make you less
lonely. And unlike your
roommate, Klosterielde
explained, "rou can
turn it off at any
moment you choose."
