Six games played . . .-nnd six
games lost: The record of the Grin—I
nell college football team this season.
is quite depressing until it is consid-'
cred a little further. The Watt pass!
attack, which has been given a great.
deal of false publicity this year, has
blown up. The squad possesses three‘
pnssers: and a composite of the threel
men would make as good a pass
heaver as any team could desire. one
is inaccurate, another cannot toss
the hall far enough, while the otherV
throws it too far. The Grinnell line
is as heavy as it has been in recent‘
years, being composed of five letter-
men, while the backfield hoa-sts two.

“hell it few facts, other than the
outcome of the games are collsids
erod, it does not scei‘n so bad that
the Pioneers are stin without vic~
tory. One, the first competitor of
the season, is still undefeated, and
this week tint school will meet
the Army team in the east. The
powerful eleven from Michiglm
state which whipped Syracuse
university, only took the Grinnell
team 14 to 0, when the home team
played its worst Drake eked out a

the present time the Bulld rs are
Imdillg the Missouri valley ooii-
:erence, and have lost only one
game during the entire season.
Creighton nosed out the Pioneers
s to o, and also won from the nice
Institute eleven, 14 to 13. When it
is considered that each oi these
teams are among the best in this
section of the country, the defeats -
aren‘t so hard to trike. ‘
