Harassment in the Pub

Pub Manager Dave Coad said harass
ment is occuring more lrequently in the
Pub this semester than last but declined to
state what he thinks is the cause tor the in.
crease, Three weeks ago. Coad confronted
a person accused or verbally abusing
another student in the Pub, After speaking
with the person. Coad sent a warning letter
which Said it the person caused any more
trouble in the Pub his membership would
be revoked. in accordance with Pub policy.

Coad said he had not heard of another in-
cident since the one three weeks ago but
Student Cathy Sullivan said she knows 01
an occurence as recent as last. weekend.
She spoke with Coad last week and he an
couragcd her to report‘any incidents ot
harassment that she saw. However.
Sullivan said that some people who have
been harassed do not want to say anything.

Coad urges anyone who experiences
such problems in the Pub to “go im-
mediately to the person who‘s in charge "
He said it is ”better to do itright at the mo-
ment it's happenin " The manager said
he cannot be in the Pub all the time but it
he is absent people should tell another
manager, a bartender or a member ol the
Pub Board.

Members of the Pub Board are Assistant

they persist in the abuse. will be expelled
train the Pub by the board

There has been one case this semester in
which a person was actually kicked out or
the Pub lor harassing students. The case is
currently under appeal. Coad has also
threatened to call the police two or three
times this semester and at least Once last
semester, He said the police have told him
that it they are called to the Pub they will
expect to make an arrest. Coad takes that
[act into consideration when dealing with
the ottenders.

bullying and thinks the trouble is caused
by one specific group.

Part of the problem. Coad believes. is
caused by drinking. "You have to con-
sider." he said, “that these people are
drunk. They are not rational." Coad does
not think drunkenness is an excuse to
harass other people. though: “Drunk or
not. they are still responsible tor the way
they are acting __ But drinking. he added.
“brings out the worst in people in some
cases "

Coad suggested a solution might be to
put a limit on how much a person could
drink in the Pub, But this restriction could
not be made on the basis or only one ol-
rcnse, he said

Sullivan said she is aware that people
become louder and rowdier when drinking.
She could excuse drunken harassment
once but alter that she would regard the
ottender as “intolerant '-
