At The Theaters

By F. R. F.

“Loose Ankles” uith Douglas
Filirluinks, Jr.. and Loretta
Young: o First Notional—Vim-
phone production. Appearing at
the Strand tonight, Thursday, and
Friday.

The team that scored in “Forward
Pass" clicks again in "Loose
Ankles.“ It's a comedy — a re—
striction in the will, three old maid
aunts, a want ad for a young man—-
plenty of comedy, one should say.
The young‘stsrs, the clean looking
Eddie Nugent give the picture the
zest of youth. Best sho the old
maid aunts on a bun.

7 A-T-T ~—

“Burning Up" with Richard
Arlen, Mary Brian; n Paramount
production. Appearing at the Col~
onial tonight, Thursday, and Fri—
day. ’

Arlen appears as a star in his
own right at last in "Burning Up."
It's a story of a straight chap that
is mixed up with crooked promoters

5 around a. race track. It has the
thrilling sequences of a Wally Reid
racing picture (do you remember
Wally in that role) and a sweet love
story.

* A-T-T

"Chasing Rainbows" with Char-
les King, Bessie Love; an MGM
production. Apparing‘ at the
Strand Saturday, Sunday, Mom
day, and Tuesday.

Recall the "Broadway Melody?”
Bessie and Charles went together so
well there that they’re paired again
and little Anita Page boats at the
door.

“Chasing Rainbows" will he the
textbook for producers of musical
shows to study for some time. Ef-
fective staging and intelligent hand<
ling in the cutting room give it a
directness of punch that we find
very seldom. And may we predict
great things for Bessie? Always
did like that girl.

i A-T-T —

"The Cock Eyed World" with
Edmund Lowe, Lily Dennis; at
Fox production. Appearing at the
Colonial Saturday, Sunday, Mon-
day, and Tuesday.

The battling stars of “What Price
Glory?” carry on their competition
for possession of the fairest maid
near the barracks. You Won’t find
any Fincbley creations nor gowns by
Worth. Instead, you’ll laugh where
you really shouldn’t and be per-
functorily surprised when your date
seems to understand more than you
thought she did.

And I’ll lay two to one that there'll
be someone interrupting study hours
trying to imitate Swede Brendel‘s
horse laugh. ,

l Organizations I

This is the sixth of a Series of
articles that the Scarlet and Black
is publishing on the various
campus organizations. The ar-
ticles are intended to give a better
understanding of the purposes,
duties, lunctions and natures of
the memberships of tho various
campus groups dealt with. in a
recent issue Sigma Delta. Chi nnd
Theta Sigmn Phi were explained.
Today. tho article takes up. the
Cosmopolitan club and the Y. M.
C. A. ,

The Cosmopolitan Club.
The Cosmopolitan club Was organ-
ized in Grinnell in 1921 by Walter
Reed. The object of the club is to
promote a better understanding of
the races of the earth and to con—
quer race prejudice. The slogan is
“Above All, Humanity."
All foreign faculty members and
students are automatically mem-
bers of the club, a. policy Which
creates a more tolerant viewpoint
among the various nationalities
which are represented on the
campus.
The meetings are held bi—mouthly
and are of an educational nature.
The programs tend to familiarize the
members with customs and ideas of
foreign lands. Foreign exhibits are
frequently held.
American students may be elected
into membership if they are interest-
ed in the club and its affairs as well
as international problems.

The Y. M. C. A.

The Young Men's Christian asso-
ciation of Grinnell college has for
its purpose the maintenance and pro-
motion of high Christian ideals
among the men on the campus.
Grinnell college has long fostered
the best traditions and ideals of col—
lege men and the Y. M. C. A. is the
authorized agent to see that they
are fully lived up to.

The work of the association falls
under three main heads: religious
education, campus service and com-
munity service. The chief work or
the religious education department
is the handling of meetings which
are held during the year. These
gatherings are conducted by either
faculty members, professional men,

Donald Fessler Will Return
Next September From China

Donald Fessler, Sic-’29, will return
to Grinnell next fall after two years
spent teaching in Grinnell-inrchina,
at Techow, Shantung, China. He
hopes to return to the United states
via Siberia and Europe, reaching

business men or students. Various
professions and vocations
sorted by able men and in this way
the college man is brought face to
face with the Christian life and what
it means to a mature man.

The educational commission works
under the main head of campus Ser<
vice. This commission studies the
new departures in educational meth—
ods on other college and university
campuses, and makes such recom-
mendations to the curriculum com-
mittee as it deems important. Each
year it continues its investigations of
educational problems of this campus
with a view to offering to the stu-
dent body the result of its investiga-
tion.

The Y. M. C, A. does not conﬁne
its activity to the campus alone. but
extends its relations into service in
the community. One of the most
important of its functions is the
maintenance of a Well-equipped clubv
room for the athletic and social
needs of the poorer boys of the city.
A Christmas dinner party, preceded
by an hour of recreation in the Cob
lege gymnasium or swimming pool
is given for these boys in the dormi-
tory dining room each year. This
commission also works with the town
men in their relations with the col-

lege.
