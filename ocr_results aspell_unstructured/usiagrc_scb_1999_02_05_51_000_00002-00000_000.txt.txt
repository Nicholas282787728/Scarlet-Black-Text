‘Grinnell will host
state speech event

Over a thousand high school per-
formerswillbringtheiracts—andtlteir
entourages —— to Grinnell High School
Saturday for the Iowa High School
Speech Association‘sstate speech con»
test.

Some 360 entries, representing 93
schools and somewhere between 1,000
and2,000performersmakethccontest
”a pretty big event," said Liz Hansen,
coach ofthe OHS theater and speech
program and organizer of the local
event.

“If the weather is nice," Hansen
said, “they've told us to expect 2,000
to 3,000 total people here that day.”

Entrants qualiﬁed for the state can
test by receiving Division I ratings
from single judges at districts two
weeks ago. The state contest in Gnn-
nell, one of four held across lowa that
day, represents the next step on the
stale speech association‘sladder, where
entries are judged by panels of three
judges. The cream of the crop will
receive three Division 1 ratings, one
from each judge. An elite few from
each performing category 7 one-act
plays. readers theater, choral reading,
television news, group mime, solo
mime, group improvisation and en-
semble acting 7 will earn the “Out-
standing Performer“ designation. Af-
ter that, point totals dictate which will
advanceto all-statecompetitionin Des
Moines another two weeks hence.

Most ofthe events will take place at
(El-{S starting at 8:30 am. Saturday;
one-act plays will actually begin Fri-
day at the community center with a
half-dozen works(including Grinnell's
entry) running in 45-minute blocks
beginning at 6 p.m., then resume Sat-
urday morning at the Harris Center, on
the Grinnell College campus,

“And it‘s all free,” Hansen said.
“That’s the bargain."

Of its l 1 entries in the district con-
test, GHS advanced 10 to the state

contest. All 58 Grinncll performers
who entered the contest at the district
level will be performing at Saturday's
state contest.

Turn store into

To the editor:

No one has wanted the Food-A-Lcss
store. It should be a roller skating rink
because people ofGnnncll would like
a place to skate instead of going to
Skatelown in Marshalltowll.

People of all ages would like IL It
would be a nice place to go in the
winter because we can t go rollerskat-

Teenagers would love it,
