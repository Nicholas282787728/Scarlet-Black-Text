8 stated in another column,
the ﬁfth number of the Y.

M. C. A. lecture course has been
secured, The work of the comr
mittee has been well done, foi
without doubt the course as ar-
ranged is one of the strongcst that
has ever been uttered to the peo-
ple of Grinnell. The committee
was espccially tortunat‘e in secure
ing Dr. Henry VanDyke. Any
comparison at this time, however,
woulrl. be premature. The
and women who are to give these

men

entertainments are not uovtces in
their line, but are personages ol
national reputation, seem
well qualiﬁed to entertain even so
critical an audience as the one fur-

nished by Glinncll.
$14 Tuesday of this week in
formation was ﬁled in tile
police court or Des Moines, charg-
ing G. W. Graeser. of Drake,with
the assault upon Reteree Lane at
the close of the DrakErGrinnell
game October 5. The information
is signed‘by l--l. P. Thompson,
pitcher on the lliglilanrl Park
baseball team. The prosecution,
under the direction of Mr. Lane's
partner,-J. R. Orivig. claims to
have ten eyewitnesses ot the as
sault, who iiill swear that Gi-aeser
is guilty. Notice was at
served ml the Drake Law School
that Graeser is wanted for trial,
and the pledge ot the school was
given that he would appear in
court as soon as the injuries re-
ceivcd in tlic initia-Draltogamc
last Fridiiy would permit. The
outcome of the trial will be await—
ed with interest. An interesting
sidelight on the case is revealed
in the statement by Mr. Orwig

THE UNIT,

The ﬁrst number of 7/517 (/7127
made its appearance today. The
magazine, bound in a neat scarlet
cover with black announcement
letters, has forty pages, thirlyrﬁve
of which are devoted to composir
tioii and ﬁve to advertising.
Eleven articlesislx of prose and
ﬁVt. of poetryicompose the table
of contents.

A review of the contents places
I/w Um‘tuo to the st'tlldcttd it has
maintained in the past. Perhaps
its most encouraging featuie is the
number of netv contributors whose
names appear on the list, whlle
former contributors show decided
improvement in their liteiary abil-
ity, proVing conclusively that The
Unit is accomplishing its mission
in Iowa College, namely: enabling
students to express their views in
a lucid manner. Great credit is
due to the managlng editoi for the
careful manner in which she ll
selected articles to represent the
different phases at college the.

Eveiy article is well worth the
time taken to read it.
