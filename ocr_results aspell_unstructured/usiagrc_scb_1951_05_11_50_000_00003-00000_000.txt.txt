The largest class on Sunday
was the stock horse class. Rid-
ers dressed in levis, wide—brim.
med hats, and cowboy shirts
put tough Western ponies
through their paces. Entrants in
this class were asked to make
their horses perform a figure
eight at a canter, race down a
straight path, come to a quick
stop, and back up, These are
maneuvers which must be per.
iormed by a horse which is
working cattle.

One of the most outstanding

garteo: ‘

Lolly Parker, Main senior:
No. All my life I have had to
go to church at 11. I like it the
way it is." ,.

nick Budlong, Rawson senior:
“Yes. It’s a good idea because
it would enable waiters and
waitresses to go to church and
still get to work on time." ‘

stu Oskamp, Gates senior:
“No! I'd have to get up a half:
hour earlier".

Jane Richardson, Loose hall
senior: “Nd. More time to sleep
or study this way. i

Bob Bredeson, Smith seniorz‘
“Ii dinner were at 1 instead of,
1:30 rt would be great. Other-l
wise it seems rather pointless."

The above question was sub»
nutted by George Jack, Cowles
junior, and was judged best by
Charmayne Wilke and Diane Po-
well, Loose hall juniors, and Peter
Carlton, Chesterfield representa-
tive on campus. For turning in

performances was given by
Menard's victory, a five gaited
horse owned by Hull's Turkey
Farm, Taintor. The small bay
was handicapped by the loss of,
a shoe during his class. The
shoe was replaced, and he re-,
turned to the ring to win the
blue ribbon.
