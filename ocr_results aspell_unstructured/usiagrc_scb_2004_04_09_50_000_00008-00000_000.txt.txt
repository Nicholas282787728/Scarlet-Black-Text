Types
of games

o There are lots or games
mlt thale, but three of the
most well-known are Texas
Hold ‘Em, Omaha and ﬁve-
:ard draw. In Texas and
Omaha, players tompose a
hand out or their personal
cards ("holecards") and
community cards, which are
used by all players.

' In Texas, two hnlecarlis
are dealt, followed by a
betting round. ihen three
community cards are dealt
lace up (the "ilop"), there's
a betting round, another
community card (the
”turrl”) is dealt, followed try
another betting round, and
than the ﬁnal community
card (the “river”) is dealt
followed by the ﬁnal
betting round.

I Omaha is played by the
same rules, except that
players receive three
holecards.

I In ﬁvemard draw, each
player is dealt five cards
down. There are two betting
rounds. In the ﬁrst round,
players can improve their
ﬁve-card hands by replacing
none, some or all of their
tards. After players receive
their replacements (the
”draw”), there is a second
round or betting. At that
point players show their
cards.

The man behind the tournament: is
Jake Petcrxon ’04, a self-professed “student

ores oi ralking ro Pererson ro undersrand
rhar poker is more rhan a game ro him. “rm
incredibly passionare abour poker. I’m very
interested in the theory and the probabili-
ries behind it. I always say it's like a micro—
cosm oflifc. It’s making rational decisions

Pcrerson organized the informal poker

gerring really inreresred in poker as oilare,"
hcsal'd. “It’s really blowing up."

Parr oi rhe

“Moor people don’t

Perorson said. “To

According ro Pcrerson, being a good

"I always say poker’s like a

When Peterson says “work," he means
