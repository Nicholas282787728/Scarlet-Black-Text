FRESHMAN GLASS THOUGHT

TO BE LARGER THAN USUAL:

War Conditions Cause Decrease in

Attendance of Most Insti-
tutions.

The uificial count of college students

shows that, in new ot the nilLlOiiﬂll

drain of war and the increase oi col-
lege expenses, Griiulell has more than
held its oun. The large number ol
cnllstments during the past year, the
necessary inclease 'n college charges,
and the rapidly r ing cost ol’rllving
led must college administrators to ex
pect an inevitable and marked decrease
in college attendance for leis—lo.

The majority or educational instituJ
trons have shown a great falling oft 111‘

numbers. Hence the announcement
that Gl'innell's attendance shows a duo
crease of but 2% is to be interpreted
as an actual advance in attendance
standards. There were but 15 more in
college last year than there are new.
Last fall the ﬁgure for college enrolls
ment was T 2, today it is 597.

The number of incoming students
is the real mark of the growth of a
college. By this standal-
has shown a real increase, for, though
ﬁgures are not yet available, the fre,
man class is understood to he unusu-
ally large.

The School of Music has naturally
suffered more than the liberal arts
with its s. n. T. C, There are’lil

enrolled, a decrease or 39. The total,

attendance for both college and School

of Music deducting duplicates, is 776.’

The total last year was 811.

GRADES GIVEN 0N
PERCENTAGE BASIS

S. A. T. 0. Requirements Change
Grading System—Standard
Is Raised.

Standards for grading were again
raised, and deﬁnite meanings in per
cents assigned to the letter mar-kings
at faculty meeting Monday. Hence—
forth an A will represent only work
from 95% to 100%, B will be 85% to
95%, C from 70% to 55%. The re-
maining are unchanged, that is. D will
mean 60% to 70%, with 60% as the
passing grade.

The requirmnent that S. A. T. C.
men be graded in per cents caused this
ﬁxing of standards, but the inevitable
result is an upward shift in the tend-
ency begun last year. An A grade, ac-
cording to the change made at that
time, was held to signify only excep-
tional, distinctive work, involving
originality on the part of the student,
while B in turn meant thorough con-
scientious work, and C a fairly good
average.

Until last year the incentive to origi-
nal study was not intensiﬁed, owing to
lack of distinction between the B and A
rating. But from this time an, origin-
ality must he of a very high sort to
be recognized.

Tile annual Grinnell banquet was
held ill Des olnes Saturday evening
after the Drake game at the Harris-
Emery tea. room. All of the football
team and the s. A. T. 0. men who
went to the game were present.

,ll. Chas. Row-son was toaslrnastcr
and several old ”grads" responded
u ith toasts to the team and to the col-
lloge. Capt. Ii, K. Adams, commandant
lot the post, was first on the program

lzuld told the men that if they went

lat them on the other side as- they had
,tlurt :tftmllooli, they would make a
.‘worthy showing.

Coach Russell Toliefson, expressed
litis appreciation of the way the men
had worked and “Doc" Hurt said that
this was tile moment he had waited for
since 1912 when Glillnell got the bad

lieutenants Minnette and u'attcrs
both told tllc men that they were glad
to he connected with such a peppy or.
garlization and landed the team and
coach. “Stdllt‘ Turner, ’11, made a

ﬁne speech pru slug both the team and.
their coach for the good work tllcy‘

did in heating the Drake eleven. Mr.
Gerard Nollen and Mr. Chas. Lyllde,

None the worse for gu mg Drake the
most decisive druhhiug in her history
lost Saturda the Crimrell football
team van thru a long signal practice
last night in preparation tor the Geo
game n t Saturday. Tho there are
no serious injuries due to the Drake
game, the team is still sore from the
effects of Sunday morning's vaccine:
tion tor typhoid. Bass and Capt. 05‘
good were still out ot uniform last
night hut the rest of the squad were
given a long work—out behind closed
gates. Scrimmage will be avoided for
several days because of sore arms but
Coach Tollcfson has strung electric
lights around the gridiorn and will
make up tor lost time the latter part of
the week.

The var ty made a most satisfactory
showing in Saturday's game. Drake
was doped to be the strongest tcanl in
the state except Iowa alld such a one—
sltlcd game was a complete surprise.
Tackles Osgood and Winters led the
line in an attack of such surc tackling
and hard charging that Drake was
never within scoring distance. The
scarlet back ﬁeld put up a snappy,
speedy offense throughout the game.
On one occasion Fraser plunged the
line and ran thru the Drake team for
70 yards. and Hass is credited with
one of 55 yards Most of the second-
string men werc put into the line-up
yet one timc or other and they per—
formed like regulars. J. c. Johnson
made an especially good showing.

Coo is expected to put up a. stiff
ﬁght in the game at Cedar Rapids next

of Iowa team to 25 points, I/aet Sate

team and Saturday’s game promises
to he a well contested struggle.

If the varsity recovers from the ct
fects of the vaccination as fast as it
should and develops the same brand

ought to defeat Coe handily.

Minn, for the first time in three weeks.

“What It Means to Live" was the
subject of his talk, with especial ref-
erence to Geo. L. Clark, ’10, who dierl
recently at his home in Boston.

Prominent as a student, he gained
great distinction as a leader in the
ﬁnancial circles'uf Boston, Quoting
from an agcd business man of that
city, the speaker said: “George Clark
was a Godsend to Boston. He had the
maturity of age, and we all took les—
sons from him. His loss is an irrep-
arable one,“

in conclusion, he said: "After all,
George Clark has lived. A man is
what counts, not the incidents of his
life.”
