Special interest hoops

By Robert Quzlsilie

The NCAA season has reached
the final stretch, nobody cares
about the NBA and the Winter
Olympics are over. So what is
left? You guessed it, another half
season of Special Interest Basket»
hall.

So far we have been treated to a
year of ﬁerce competition. bitter
rivalry, clutch shooting. sheer
hustle, awe and wonderment,
nothing short of basketball at its
finest. The second half promises
more of the same, so, at this time
we would like to give the rankings
as we pick them and the odds as
we see them.

Coming, in at first place, the
first unanimous pick of the year
(10,000 votes). is Liquid Snake
Dance. With a record of 6-1, LSD
(a latecomer), made its presence
felt immediately. Upon introduc-
tion LSD changed the color and
tone of everything. They suffered
one loss to Jiahn Chen-Yu. but
that was a fluke. LSD is favored to
take the bag. Odds: 2. .

Second place goes to a team that
continues to sputter and spurt and
yet somehow wins, The Sea Men.
These guys have the only chance
of upsetting Liquid Snake Dance,
but mat chance is remote. And
they may be vunerahle to our
third and fourth place picks, The
Nads and The Chucks. However
the Sea Men have only lost one
outing and that was to LSD. The
Sea Men 6-1, the Odds: 3:1.

in third, the Nads. Our pre-
season picks for the number one
position, The Nads, have been
strong, but did not hold solid when
they were in the grip of the likes of
the Sea Men , and LSD. Our
observers comment that they
have also exhibited too much ball
handling on the court. For the 572
Nads the Odds are 5:].

In fourth; The Chucks. Though
they are 4-3 at the mid mark, the
Chucks have lain down for no one.
These boys may get the E Dom-
browski, Charlie Husﬂe” award
yet. This bunch of no names (we
don’t know their names) have and
will continue to be the needle in
the sidu of our top teams. Odds
10:1.

Fifth on the list is .liahn Chen»
Yu and His Cloistered Con-
templatives 4-3. Besides its name,
this team has a proble Fifth on
the list is .liahn Chen»Yu and his
Cloistered Contemplatives 4—3.
Besides its name, this team has a
problem with continuity. Between
Mickey ‘The Mad Bomber' Mune
ly and the rest, we don't know
whether they are playing B-ball or
throwing the Olympic hammer.
Odds 11:1.

It's getting warm outside so
maybe the sixth placed Fecal Peo-
ple will go back to playing tennis.
Our spotters say their overhand
smashes look great. Record: 25,
Odds: 20:1,

In a gleaning seventh The Pub
Rats are now 1—6, and the future
does not look bright. Though they
have moved up a slot from our
pre-season ranking, they continue
to show that their talents lie
elsewhere. The PR's may in fact,
be completely out of the picture. A
source has informed us that five of
the team's members were found
in the Pub after me eleven o‘clock
curfew and have been placed on
doublesecret trustee probation. If
any of them miss one more eight
o’clock class... Odds 100:1.

George Rat/ling was reported to

Grinnell Vikings
skate to

moral victories

By Brian Broderick

Saturday night at Cowles park-
ing lot. A crowd of unemployed
soccer players and Easterners
wait to board 3 Biology Depart-
ment minibus headed for Des
Moines. 1 board the bus and fall
asleep as soon as we're on the
road. Jack Kerouac would be
disappointed.

Des Moines. Rain. Merle Hay
Road. Ice Arena..Des Moines Buc-
caneers. U.S.H.L. Not tonight.
Tonight we’re gonna play hockey,
Grinneil Viking-style. A crowd
forms.

inside a reeking locker room,
the Grinnell College Hockey Club
(aka. Vikings), led by R.A.
goalie Kino Ruth (number “00”),
prepares to ‘ face a group of
players from the Des Moines
Men's League.

The players provide their own
equipment, much of it left over
from their junior-league hockey
days, “We get $200.00 a year from
the S.G.A., but most of it goes for
ice time,” Kino says, putting on
the armor of a goalkeeper." We
meet the rest of the costs
ourselves," he adds.

The game begins at 10:15 p.m.,
earlier than usual in order to draw
a crowd.

The team, a dozen or so players,
is a diverse lot: men and women
(2), freshmen through seniors,
jock stereotypes, amateur
amateurs, and a guy with long
hair and a tiedied jersey. in other
words, a microcosm of the college
on ice skates.

The team leaves the locker
room, walking on skates, an art
which lesser beings such as your
faithful narrator will never
master.

A mysterious figure known only
as “The Commander" starts the
time clock with a couple of fog-
horm-like buzzes that shatter the
peace of the nearempty arena.

The teams take the ice and the
rodeo begins.

The Vikings have their own
”box" which I share with those
who aren’t playing and their self-
proclaimed “coach” and

acheerleader, Lisa ,Van Sand, As

whims 1."

front of us and the puck
reverberates off the plexiglass
windows that surround the ice
(except for where l was stupid
enough to stand), it becomes clear
that this is a rough game.
However, both teams usually
avoid any excess hitting.

The other team (I will refer to
them conveniently as “them"
from now on) shows their prowess
by skating around the Vikings and
finding Kino’s weakness, Several
goals are scored.

The Vikings, however, come
back. Neil Boris, who dares to
play without his glasses, scores a
couple oi quick goals, which tire
up the team. In celebration, the
crowd of a dozen or so fans from
the college shares cans of Old
Style with the team. Now we have
a game.

Leif, ”The Franchise” Larsen,
a freshman, puts in another Vik~
ing goal. No one pays attention to
the other team’s (oh yeah,
“them's”) score. This is the Zen
of hockey at work.

Sophmore Steve Howe tips in a
shot by Steve Nash. “Them" pour
on the goals, but the “Com-
mander”, who is also in charge at
the scoreboard, ignores this. The
score reads 44:, for awhile at
least.

Other Viking goals pile up as the
players hop irom the “box“ over
the boards onto the ice, and vice
versa, yelling their positions
(“center!”, “defenset”, etc.) for
their substitutes. Sophomore
Dave Lillienstein, “The Fran-
chise”, Grinnell Magazine editor
Tony Margherita, and Rowe add
goals. The ”Commander" wakes
up and the scoreboard is cor-
rected. 12-5. As if they cared.

The game ends at 11:00 p.m.
and both teams desert the ice,
leaving it a mess of skate tracks
and blood (just kidding),

The Vikings shower up and say
goodbye to Des Maine: for
another week. stopping by the
Quick Trip for beer and munchies
before hitting the interstate; when
l fall asleep again. Good game,
