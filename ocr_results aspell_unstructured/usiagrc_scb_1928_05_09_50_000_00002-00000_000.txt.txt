FAULT/1‘ TL'DI-KNT PROBI .

A great deal has been said around the campus this
year about the very apparent lack of harmony existing
between facility and students. misunderstanding has
arisen in many instances out of intimate campus ques-
tions, such as strident golernnlent and the various as-
pects of dormitory lire, This feeling has spread into
other ’fields, and become. concerned with any‘ expression
either by students or faculty.

0n the one hand students have issued ultiulatums,
statements. declarations, denunciations, which have re-
ceived widespread criticism, and on the other hand fec-
ulty niemhers lime done the same. Each incident hits
served to widen still farther the gap between the groups.
The entire situation has tended lto aggravate campus
problems. and render solutions more difficult of attain—
ment.

A particular case in point might be a faculty chapel
speech in which the speaker assumes a critical attitude
on every point from the subject of “prepping" to Amer-
ican foreign policy. Now, the students may or may not
agree with each particular argument presented, but they
do come to the conclusion that, since this type of speaking
is so prevalent, the facility must consider itself a
professional body of chronic fault-finders. ’Upon learn-
ing that a student disagrees with the whole or a port of
the speakers pronouncements, the faculty will tell the
attending student that his thinking is invalidated in this
instance because of an emotional reaction to one point
in the speech. Thus we have the vicious circle of reason-
ing that may aptly he applied to discredit any opposition,

and the student is left with a queer, negative feeling of
inferiority.

We suggest that professors may be perfectly sincere
in ttleir wholesale censure or American foreign policies,
or our economic and social systems, or the Grinncll
dormitory enter-pl c. It is not necessarily true that
they c dealing in professional bigotry. However, it
they are honestly convinced of the trlith or their opinions,
and lire attempting to convert students to their causes,
tlicy should be careful of the method of persuasion. lest
ends become defected by the use of ill-advised means,

Underlying the whole college project, we suspect, lies
all ambition to cause undergraduates to do some inde—
pendent thinking, Hence, we might assume that the
more or less violent remarks issuing'consistelltly from
the ranks of the learned are simply devices for goadlng
intractable students into processes of thought As such
they are worthy, hilt if they are simply fair samples of
ancient “liallow liberalism" done up in new packages.
their useiullle s impaired, for they generate distrust of
llcdilelllic opinion.

Those rather rambling remarks are merely calculat-
ed to emphasize the crying need for closer bonds of Sym'
pathy and understanding, mutual appreciation and llBlllr
flilness, between faculty and students on the Grinlicll
campus, Granted. that the average undergraduate knows
very little, uml thinks even less; granted. that the
world, facile and gullible as it is, needs a group of in
telligcutsia to point out its detections; ill, the best l'er
suits will obtain not through antagonistic exercises of
the w , hllt through recognition of virtues, and careful,
invigorating stimulation.
