Freshman Stars

have an opportunity to show their
wares the week of May 11-16, when
they engage in a telegraphic meet,
The Oklahoma Aggies took first
place last year, but competition this
year will be kecnsr with the possible
addition of Butler university, the
newest member of the loop.

Creighton university has establish-
ed a precedent of awarding any
freshmen who breaks a university
record in the telegraphic meet a var-
sity letter. Last year, two freshmen,
Robert Lanyon, high hurdler. and
“Shorty" Lindvall, iavclin thrower,
won sweaters.

Altho Coach Duke is not satis-
fied with the present turnout of
freshmen for track here, the Little

Klveen, Gordon, Clark. Mason, MC-
Millin. and Morgan are a few of the

more promising yearlings working
out.

on a Drake relays program.

 

Ey MARY MILLER

The fatal day dawned gray and
overcast; not until late in the after-
noon did the elusive sun promise the
fresh a happy picnic in the woods,
rather than a dismal dance in the
women’s gymnasium,

In keeping with their rustic objec-
tives were the two trucks provided
as transportation. The usual two to
one standard in regard to the nun-iv
her of men and women at class di -
hers and such like prevailed. (We
guess more women are attracted by
food than men. At least that is the
best interpretation to give the men's
singular indifference.)

Shining Example

And so amid anticipatory giggles
and guffaws the freshmen started out
to set a shining example of what a
picnic ought to heeNot even chap—
crones were forgotten. Little Des
Moines, harmless sounding name of
a grove west on highway 6 was selec-
tcd as the scene for this delightful
pastoral.

Freshmen Raise Picnic Standard;
Play ‘Tllree Deep,’ ‘Hide and Seek’

weather was mild but the insects
were as yet unobtrusive. Not a sin-
gle beetle hit their legs; not a lone
mosquito disturbed the peaceewon‘

the mouths of babes and sucklings

“Hide and Seek” \ ,

Having consumed pans of macar-
oni, piles of sandwiches, quarts of
cocoa and innumerable pickles, the
picnickcrs plunged with characteris-
tic cnthusiasm into the recreation
provided for the evening. Notice the
technique with which they led up
from such a healthful sport as base-
ball to the less enervating but more
coy “Three Deep". To crown the eve-
ning they played that most tantaliz-
ing of gamcs, Hide and Seek. “We'll
do that after dark," said the social
chairman naively.

Three cheers for the freshmen. No
longer will we have to speak of pics
nics behind our hands. At last we
have an uplifting influence upon the

as delegates to the county conven~
tion in Montezuma which will meet
July 2.

Chairman J. Richard Sneed of the
campus organization explained that
the county convention which meets
July 2 is very likely to be an exciting
one because the convention must
nominate any county officers not
nominated in the primary June 6, and

vention which will nominate for state
offices where no candidate received
35 per cent of the primary vote.

The Grinnell College Republican
club called a meeting early in the
spring which was addressed by Jay
N. Darling, Charles Rawson, Martha
McClure and Harrison Spangler.

Senator Smith W. Broukhart and
Gov. Dan Turner have been asked by
the club to address a meeting to be
held early in May. Both men have
expressed their willingness to come,
Chairman Sneed‘ said, but a date has
not yet been set.

Clark lost no time in insuring vic-

times in the first inning of its
game with Rawson. From then on,
Rawson settled down and outplayed
its rivals, but the damage had al-l

making a play to tag Bennett out at
_the plate and was forced to leave
the game. The Langaneclark playoff
for the trophy will probably be held
Monday.

The outdoor season will start next
week when the six teams get under
way. The indoor race was uncertain
from start to finish, and many sur-
prises resulted. By virtue of their all-
round strength and pitching ability,
Gates and Dibble halls rank as slight
favorites to win the outdoor title.
Langan and Clark both have well-
balahced aggregations and, if their
pitchers hold up, may come thru.
Smith and Rawson, both disappoints
