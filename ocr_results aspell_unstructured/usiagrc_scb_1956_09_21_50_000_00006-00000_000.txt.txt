Pine Wood Splinters 0n Preps Again;
Undercldss Spirits Sore Once More

With gleeful cries, men will resume sli'attirlg at Mons
dlty night liouselneeting's during this fall’s six—week prep-

ping program. It has been a
fired,

year since the last swat was

‘ "Sii'atting” may be defined as the meeting of a flimsy
pine paddle and a prep's posterior with all tlle other mem—

bers ot the hall yelling at the
tops of their respective voices.
This is the punishment for vio-
lating prepping rules,

The c of HP, which heads
416 program. felt that swats
should be given ior “specific
violations" Stephen 9. Me»
.nonaid, prepping chairman,
observed that “it would be
better it the poor prep knew
what he was being swntted
for."

Preps may be swatted tor
smoking or walking on thc
grass while on central campus,
and failure to wear their fresh-
men bcaiiies. violation of l2
duties listed in the Handbook
for Men also rate a swat.

it a ii-cshmzm can get through
the week without an uppcrclass-
man autographing his violations
book, he will not be swatted at
the next Monday night house—
meeting (theoicticaliy speaking,
of coulse).

Prepping ioi men begins Mon~
day and will last until Nov. 3.
when. as their last duty, freshr
men will be in charge or each
hall’s Homecoming decorations.
Informal initiation will take
place the tollowing weekend

During these six weeks, the
C or HP announced, “freslh
men will be expected to re»
serve Saturday atternoons tor
suchiurtherduties or projects
as the prepmasters, the c of
HP or the house councils may
see lit." These “duties” will
include mass workday-s at
Lake Acre, all-campus i’reshc
man picnics and cheering sec-
tions at football games.

This fall's program, MacDonr
ald said, will attempt to empha-
size thc constructive elements
of prepping, such as dining
r’v‘iuete. dating. dance instrue
tion and hall activities

Calling Outside?
It Takes Time

“If the students will have
patience with the college opera
tor, the telephone service will
be much more efficient," said
Norman W. Marble (building
and grounds) when explaining
the new procedure tor calling
outside numbers. when a Silk
dent is calling a nunlber outa
side the college, the numbcr
must be given to the college
operator ,direct instead ot askr
ing for “outside" as has been
done in years past,

Students are also reminded
that all phones in the city‘ of
Grinnell have new numbers with
a Belmont exchange. Marble
said
that if a student wants to lnztke
an 'outside call and doesn‘t
know the number he must iii-st
ask for outside information and
then give the number to the
college operator.

The college' new number is
BElmontlﬁ-SIZI.’ This number
should be used by parents mak
.ing calls to the college.
