S+a+e Commission
Surveys Route 6;
May Trim Campus

Members of tile state high-
way commission were on
campus Tuesday and Weds
nesday surveying Highway
6 for possible improvements
and for a widening of the
highway. The foreman of the
surveying crew mentioned
that it was possible that the
road would be straightened
to cut across part of the
college grounds.

M. B. Starr, Grimeii city
manager and engineer, express
ed the opinion that it prob-
ably won’t go through the cam~
pus but continue to go around
with probably a mere widening
of the highway.

Acting president Rupert
Hawk said, "Periodically the
highway surveying crews have
‘sighted lines’ across the south
campus of Grinnell College.
Trustee R. s. Kinsey and my
self have conreri-ed, at other

times, 'with representatives of

were assured that the surveys
were only of a tentative
nature and that no pre-de»
termined plan existed as to

how Highway No. a should

nreceed through Grinncll. I

do not know the reason for

the present interest in such a
survey, hut I assume that it is
still of the same nature as

that of the previous surveys.

We plan to contact the repre-
sentatives of the lows Highway
Commission within the next few
days. We will certainly oppose
vigorously any attempt to "cut
through" the Campus. However.
one must remember that a sur-
vey, in and of itselt, is not a
road."

“Soundings are being taken
across campus," stated Norman
Marble, superintendent oi build-
ings and grounds, “but that is
no sign that the highway will
go across campus. They are
merely continuing work starmd
last summer."

The Sound
and

by Art Travers

This week I'm going to
play a little game with my
self. The idea is taken from
Leonard Feather of Down-
beat magazine and it’s called
WIWDIICTGITUOMD (What
I Would Do If I Could Tlll‘ll
Grinnell Into The Utopia Of
My Dreams). The rules are
quite simple. You just sit
back and imagine.

I'd put the college library
under a new system. Books of
fiction and other books which
are nonsreference and not on
reserve might be taken out for
a semester. The library would
have the power to call back any
book which they needed.

There would be a cigarette
machine in the Union and in
certain other accessible areas
so that smokers would he able
to get cigarettes When the
Grille and Bookstore were
closed.

Younker Hall would he turns
ed 90 degrees, thereby becoming
East Younker and West Youn-
ker (No War Between The
states).

There would be paper towel
dispensers in the washrooms of
the men’s dormitories.

Friars coffee hours would
accomplish more by placing
Panel Members directly on the
spot an certain issues. Panels
would be mixed student and
faculty and would primarily
discuss among themselves.
There would be a faculty col.
umn in the 5&8 rotated weekly
among faculty members.

Well, that should give you an
idea of what the game is like.
Now, you try it. 1 would wela
come any suggestions or ideas.
Who knowsisome of

things may come to pass.
