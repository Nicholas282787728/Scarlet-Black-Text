The womanly ideal ‘ol‘ the average
college girl is a cross between Joan oi

- Are, a state Y. W. c, A:sectetory and
the‘iavorite lady professor. The com-
bination is quite too good to be true
and the girl is likely to rind, on emerg
ing from college halls. that the beiluLir
iul image ct womanhood, acnti ~ed
slowly through the tour years oi acad-
emic lite, must be put away with pen-
nunts, “I airi— Wllo are You" cards
and other trophies, which count but
little in the uldei lite and the now due
ties brought by later years.

to lay aside the ideal oi callege days

grow it,'eren, but when she deliber
ately and conscientiously throu,
throws it array as no longer at tor use.
its weaknesses are demonstrated.

The very best sorts oi ideals come
easily and naturally, through contact
with teachers and students in whom
splendid qualities are apparent, and the
normal and commendable desire to
please onc's associates and to imitate
those persons who seem to us beaut
iul and noble, leads to the lornration
oi a‘rather one but attainable ideal.
Familiarity \ th the great ones oi lite

NEW RULES FOR SOCIETIES

Committee Discusses Change In
Present System.

REGULATIONS D R A W N UP

Renewal of Former Spirit Is Arte
ticipated.

The New Movement in the Girls‘ 50-
cieties is being propelled by the ammo
present Grinnell Spirit. There has been
a great deal or criticism hurled at the
girls' societies by outsiders who have
been content to raitl hrrt otter no relu-
edy. The girls themselves have re
all'ted. that conditions are not what they
should be and so have set about to had
a remedy ill the iorni or new regula-
tions which the inLEl'rso icty committee
have recommended ior consideration.
These regulations seem in spirit to do
away with some oi the evils; whether
or not they do in fact. can be iotintl out
only by trial, They are as tollow

1. That on the ﬁrst Friday in each
month all or the sotielles shall have
closed programs.

2. That the election oi Freshmen
girls be held the second Friday in may,
at which election all vacancies includ-
ing those oi the outgoing Seniors. be
tilled. That the usual (all election he
held to ﬁll any vacancies that might
occur. At this election the new girls
who register in niiy ot the three upper
classes will be eligible.

3. That there be a permanent inter-A
society committee composed at two
girls iroiu each society, to promote ln~
tor-society iellowship.

4, There shall be no society houses

it will also be understood that st '
ety members will make only two dates
in advance with horrsociety girls,

The girls will be on their honor to
eat-h. perscanall)’, live up to the regular
tlons. Every girl agrees that it is what
she wants.

The change in the date oi election
will rause the Societies to he made up
entirely oi members iroin the three
upper classes. The election would be
held iii the spring ins‘eud oi in the (all
so that the Senior girls might have a
voice in it and so that the Societies
might. be practically full when work
begins in the tall.

AILho these regulations mi‘ ~eerh
