Politically Incorrect —

And Proud ofIt

I saw another pro-choice demonr
stration on the news today, and it
occurred to me that it‘s about time
for my annual defense of the prorlife
position.

I’m sure this column will be pro-
ceeded in the S & B by an article
relaying the experiences of those
students who attended the rally, in
Washington, DC. I’m sure it will
include quotes like “I felt more cor-
rect titan I ever have before." or
maybe“lt was avery uplifting expe-
rience, to see women uniting to take
control of their lives.” ,

In all honesty. one demonstration
is very like another. (This one did,
however. fall short of the predicted
tumoutofonemillion,assooptimis-
tically estimated by Molly Yard last
July.) The catchy chants, the songs,
the poems — they all make me
wonder if I‘m the only person who is
reminded of the revivalist scene in
Huckleberry Finn. You know, the
scene where the Duke and the King
whip the crowd into an emotional
frenzy with songs and brotherhood
and moral correctness. Quite the feel»
good experience indeed.

I'm not going to give you the same
proﬁlife arguments] have in the past.
You've heard them before. The
abortion issue has more or less po-
larized the people one way or the
other and arguments don't sway
anybody anymore. So instead of
reciting arguments toyou, I’m going
to ask you some questions.

top of a cliff, holding a rope. An-
other person is climbing up the rope.

below you. You let go of the rope
and the other person falls to their
death. Did you murder them’.7 Did
the other person have any right to
expect you to hold on to the rope?
Were you not merely exercising
control over your own hands when
you let go of the rope? Don’t you

A New Order for Europe

After being surprised by once-
impossible changes in the Soviet
Union. Hungary and Poland in the
recentpast,it’snowEastGermany’s
turn to surprise us. But changes in
Eastﬁerrnany mean more than sur-
prises. They also enlail a rethinking
of the postwarEuropean order, which
was based on the division of Ger;
many.

The arguments against German
reunification have been weakened
by the changes in East Germany. A
recent discussion sponsored by some
faculty members last week in Main
Lounge was very successful in its
analysis of events in Europe in gen-
eral and East Germany in particular.

The direction EastGennany takes
in the near future will prove to have
a very important impact on Europe,
for it will be the nature of the new
East Germany that will determine
the new thinking of the European
order. Predictions are pretty ridicu-
lous for the simple reason that

changes in Eastern Europe have been
characterized by the unexpected. The
Soviet Union is as bafﬂed as the
West. Even in East Germany. there
is some fumbling in 'the dark. The

EastGerman Party leadership keeps
on changing their statements as
events unfold.

German reunification has been
ruled out in the immediate future.
Gorbachev says it is too early to
discuss a single Germany, and East
German leader Egon Krenz agrees.
Kohl says reunification is not some-
thing theGermanscanresolvealone.
Even the Westisnot too happy about

reunifying Germany yet. TheSoviet~

Union does not want East Germany
out of the Warsaw pact, so a neutral.
Austriandike status is also ruled out
in the immediate future.

On Thursday, the East German
Communist Party‘s Central Com-
mittee declared a radical program of
change.Politically,itdeclarwplans
for“free, democratic and secret elec-
tions" and some civil libenies. But
as it was pointed out at the Main
Lounge discussion, the Communist
Party would probably badly lose free
elections. Would they accept that?
That is a question currently being
hotly debated in the party. The an-
swer to the question depends on who
wins that debate.

If the Communists were to be
displaced. however, there are quitea
few capable opposition parties wait-
ing on the sidelines, And as Keith
Fitzgerald pointed out, giving the
mess to someone else to clean up

U.S. Congress is at odds with the Bush admin tra-
tion over two foreign policy conduct issues. A Justice
Department memorandum advocating seizure of US
fugitives in foreign countries regardless of the consent
of the host country is facing opposition in Congress.
And some members of Congress are saying they want
to limit the President from using funds obtained from
foreign countries to ﬁnance
U.S intelligence operations.
The Justice Department
memo was prompted by the
Noriega situation while lran—
gate prompted the Congress
move.

Israel Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
currently in the U.S on a visit, held talks with President
Bush and Secretary of Smite Baker Wednesday to dis—
cuss the latest peace proposal. The proposal, advocat-
ing elections in the occupied ten-itories and Israeli-Pal—
estinian negotiations over a wide variety of controver-
sial topics, was proposed by Shamir himself. Shamir‘s
current condition is a guarantee from the U.S that the
PLO. will not be involved in negotiations. Atthc end
of thetalks, they declared that the nextmovc mustcome
from the Arabs. especially Egypt, which has bccn silent
on the issue for some time.

East Germany The East German Communist
Party surprised the world on Thursday by removing its
citizens' travel and emigration resu'ictions. Over two
million East Germans crossed the Berlin Wall into
West Berlin through the week, although 95 percent
returned to East Germany afterwards. Hans ModroW,
considered a top reformer, became Prime Minister last
weekend as another series of changes went underway.
The Party’s Central Committee announced a radical
program of change on Thursday including plans to hold
“free, democratic and secret elections and to convert the
economy into a “socialist planned economy oriented to
market conditions." Reunification of Germany has
beendismissed by the USSR. as too premature. Krenz
and Kohl, the two German leaders, have endorsed a
similar position. The rate of change is being linked to
economic aid by West Germany. Modrow talks about
“step by step" reform, while West Germany promises
economic aid if immediate changes are initiated.

E. Europe Events in East Germany have led to
pressure on other East European countries to adapt to

the new winds of change. In Bulgaria, Communist
Party leader Todor Zhivkov resigned to give way to

new, more responsive leaders. In Czechoslovakia the
leadership has relaxed travel restrictions to the West.
Cuba, however, expressed sadness at the bend of events
and reaffirmed its commitment to Marxism. Mean-
while, French President Francois Mitterand has invited
European Community leaders to Paris to discuss recent
events in Eastern Europe.

Namibia In highly sucv
cessful elections held last
week and supervised by the
U.N.. the South West Afri-
can People‘s Organization,
or SWAPO,emerged the vic-
tor, obtaining 57 percent of
the votes required to send its
delegates to the Constituent
Assembly. Failure to obtain a two-thirds majority.
however, means that SWAPO will not be able topass its
own policy program but will have to negotiate one with
opposition parties. .

China Deng Xiaoping resigned Thursday as chair-
person of the Central Military Commission, the most
powerful post in China, and his place was taken byJiang
Zemin. However, his status derived from his historical
role is expected to make him remain very inﬂuential,
despite Deng’s insistence on his intention to quit poli-
tics.

El Salvador TheleftistguerrillamovcmentFWN
launched a determined offensive against the govem-
ment Saturday by invading the capital, San Salvador.
Theof fensivc waslaunchcd following thebreakdown of
peace talks and the blowing up ofa labor union building
earlier in the month. Estimates of people killed in the
fighting range from 300 to 500.

Nicaragua Changes in contra leadership have re-
sulted in a shift in their bargaining position at the current
peace talks with the Sandinistas going on at the UN. in
New York. The latest Sandinista proposal was a drop
ping of their insistence that the contras disband by Dec.

Nicaragua and restrict themselves to Honduras. The
contras have dismissed the proposal as an attempt to
make them give up their wartime gains in Nicaragua.

Lebanon Lebanese President Rene Moawad ap-
pointed as Prime Minister Selim alrl-loss. Tensions and
deadlock continue, however,as powerful Christian leader
General Michael Aoun still refuses to recognize
Moawad’s administration, calling it a puppet of the
Syrians. Syria has 30,000 troops in Lebanon.
