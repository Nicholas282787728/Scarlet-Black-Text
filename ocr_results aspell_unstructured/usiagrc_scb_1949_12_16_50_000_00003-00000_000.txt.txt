Drop Decision To Monmou’rh

Grinnell, in Its conference debut, squeezed by Coe last Friday
5147; only to blow a 45—37 decision to the Scots at Monmouth on
Tuesday night.

Soberly commenting after the Tuesday night drubbing, Coach
Pftiseh sard, “On paper and man to man we’re superior to both Coe
and Monmouth, but on the floor we were outhustled and outplayv
ed. As well as we played against Iowa State 'last week,” he con-
tinued, “We played, in reverse, just as poorly again Coe and Mont
mouth. Our mental and emotional approach to both games was

poor, something that must and will be remedied in the future,”

he concluded.

Coe, last year’s cellar holders,
surprised the Pioneers with an
unorthodox zone defense which
foiled Grinnell in Its attempt to
drive in and set up its plays.
Only control of both backboards
brought victory. Jim Heiny sal—

"Grinnell looked better in the
first five minutes of play against
Monmouth than they have all

points in this five minute spree,"
affirmed Coach Pfitsch.
Minutes later the score rerd

SCARLET AND BLACK

Beloit Bucs Fla):
8 Holiday Tiits

By Dickie Clark .

Are you feeling sorry for the
Grinnell cagers who are giving
up part of their Christmas va-
cation to play in the holiday
tournament Dec. 29th and 30th?
Well, things could be worse for
the Pioneers. For example, take
a look at the Beloit Christmas
lineup.

While Grinnell will play two
holiday tilts. Beloit’s Bucca-
neers will take on teams from
California, Utah, Kentucky, and
Ohio, will travel to West Vir-
ginia to take on Marshall col.
lege in a pair of games, and
will have played eight contests
between now and the January
6th Beloit vs. Grinnell game.

Even so, the Eeloit schedule
shows the Bucs playing six
fewer games this season than
last year. Beloit has 27 tiltsl
lined up this year, é'ompared tel
33 contests played last year.

But according to a new ruling
passed at the last Midwest cone
ference meeting, Beloit will
have to be content with fewer
games next year. The ruling
clamps a season limit of twenty
games on all conference teams,
but allows post-season tourna—
ments in excess of 20 games.
