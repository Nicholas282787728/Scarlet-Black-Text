Football.

While football practice this
week has not tendcd lo undue
conﬁdence in sornercspects it has
been encouraging. The men have
evrdcntly proﬁted by the Bliss
worth game and thus far have
shown commendable improve-
ment in spirit. One might well
wish for more speed as the inter
forcncc is moving slowly. but the
great majority of bolh'varsity and
scrub are entitled to credit
carncst cndcavor. Willingness
and determination are apparent
but speed and dash arc lacking.
With a team averaging from ten
to twenty pounds lighter than its
opponents, vim is absolutely cs
sential to success. Without it
Grinncll's prospect is a blank.
It should not be forgotten the
Ames game is little more than
two weeks' distant. With few
exceptions cvcry man wearing
the scarlct and black will be
pounds lightcr than his visavis.
Reckless abandon and determiflar
tion to leave the game victors or
cripples constitute our only hope
otsnccess. But this spirit will
not rise spontaneously when the
I. S, C. giants Canter onto the
local gridiron. It must be cultir
vatad in daily practice. The man
who plays the dullard against the
scrub will hardly rise to an emerr
gcncy. He become so
thoroughly imbued with devotion
to his duty that it will become a
part ot him. Only by infusion of
greater dash in practice can Grins
ncll sustain the reputation for
“gamcncss” gained in days of
yore. On the whole. however.
'varsity and scrub arc loyaily dis—
posed and should be received
with better attendance at practice.

On the dark side of the picture.
two things arc presented. sever
al men have been injured the past
week and indications are the clev-

for

must

en will go to Minneapolis badly
crippled. Noncofthclnjnricsarc
serious but they will grcatly retard
practice. The men thus unforr
tunate should exercise extraordi-
nary care. All this. of course. is
the fortune of war, and injuries
will inevitably result from good,
faithful practice. Far more dis—
heartening is the narrow, almost
contenlptible. spirit shown by two
or three men regarding training.
They daily manifest an indiffer-
encefotrainingrulcsthatamounts
to profanity of traditions for many
years sacred in Grinnell football.
Not the least consideration is the
establishment of an evil precc~
dent. It furnishes excuse for lax-
ity of training in years to come
and aims at the Very hcart of Grin-
nell‘s athletic system. It is hoped
those delinquent in this respect
will yct sce fit to do the right and
manly thing before the season is
much older. Only so can they
command the rcspcct of any sclt—
respecting student.

Hoibrook and Myers both ap-

will probably play his old posi

as to what he will do. as his eyes
are giving him trouble. With
both our old halvcs playing their
positions the succcssofthc Hawlc
