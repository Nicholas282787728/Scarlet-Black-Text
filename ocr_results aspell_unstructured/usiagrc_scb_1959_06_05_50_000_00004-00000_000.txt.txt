Growing Pains Part II

Two years ago olle of 0111' predecessors sat down at what
\i as most likely the sanle typewriter that we are staring at
now, and wrote a Commencement editorial titled “Growing
I'ajns.”

That editorial didn‘t end with tile last period;
to be finished.

At that time the development program was taking its-

changes ill student relationships that would ensue.
So they protested. And we agree that these protests

In the last paragraph of that editorial was the sentence: 1
"Whether this, the beg'illninir of aperiad of change, has
lieen a ‘good’ year can be judged only 011 the basis of adzl
justlnents which will be made in the future.”

We can now begin to judge that year. It was. we b
have, a “good" one. Next fall we’ll do our studying ill a m
lion dollar library. The year after that the fine arts centeri
llill be in llse and over 90 men will be housed ill a new dor-
lititorl'.

Any idea that “the student body was getting lost ill the
shuffle” u'as dispelled this year by the students themselves.

A re sed curriculum will make any statements concern-l
illg‘ the liberal arts philosophy of Grillnell more meaning-fut:
1an the social side, women's “hours” were made much more;

The most sensation‘ thin;r the students did this yeal"
was to put forward the idea of “open lounges” and ”open
dorms” .Tliey have operated successfully and will nou collie
before the trustees lol their judgement. We hope that this;
same 'spirit of change" that no perceive on campus has;
found its uay to these men

The administlation has seen fit to make money avail-,
able for improvements in the Student Union, after the stu-{
dents made it known, through pledges of money from their
government, that they believed they were needed.

And there are many other instances where an adnlillis—l
trator of the college or a member of its faculty has perceived!
that this “change” is present and made a positive colltribu-l

Voltaire put them to use in his
