Smoker Tllurslllly Evening

Thursday evening the delegates to?
the convention were entertained at a
smoker by the Ames Commercial Club,
at. which time Harvey lngham, Editor
of the Des Moincs Register, and C w.
Barron, publisher of the Wall Street.
Journal and of three other ﬁnancial
papers, spoke. “Newspaper men or.
the next 25 years will have tbs oppoi--
tun v to occupy a place second to noI
othel group in tho solving of lhe‘
world's three greatest problems,” said.
Harvey Inghalil, Hc stressed the
three problems confronting theu‘orld‘
which lie prophesied will outlast tlrc
prcscnt generation, namely, the ﬁnan—
cial confusion, racial prejudices, and‘
the tendency on the part of the Unit-
all states to abandon their policy of
“peaceful pcnratation" of its inﬂuence
in favor or assertion hacked by might.

Advantage or College l

Clarence w. Barron, the principal
speaker at the convention is recog-
nized everywhere as America's leading-
editor of ﬁnance. ”College.” he said,
“gives a man a great inauy fundamen—
tals he will neber have time to get
alter he gcts out into the world. There
it is a race ior bread and butter," He
illustrated his points with experiences
in the ofﬁces of the Wall street Journ—
al. ,

Speaking on world ﬁnancial colltli-'
tions, in which he is an expert, llr.‘
Barron said_tbat only one debt, that
of thc Unitcd States, is a lair dcbt, tho:
only one which can be paid. No oth—

. er country is solvent, all others are'
actually bankrupt ﬁgures show. Ger-
many, for example has liabilities or
400 billions marks, whereas her assots
arc only 5 billion.

John T. Frederick, editor or the Mid-
land, and ncan C. F. Curtiss, Dean
and Director of Agr ulturc at Iowa
state, also spoke brieﬂy, and variety
was given the occasion by the A-M-Ess
quartet.
