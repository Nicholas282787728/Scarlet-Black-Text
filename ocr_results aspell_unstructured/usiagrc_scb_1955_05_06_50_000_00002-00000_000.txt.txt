An all-college assembly-in honor of President-elect
Howard Bowen was held in Herrick Chapel, Aprll 30 at
10 o’clock. Following is the text of his speech:

its reputation until the flood of
mail began pouring in after my
appointment was announced. I
wish that I might read some of
it to you. The consistent theme
is that Grinnell is not jusl an—
other small liberal arts college.
It is a very special institution
with a unique and precious
heritage.

I have asked myself: “What
accounts for the outstanding rape
utation of Grinncll and for the
quite remarkalble loyalty of its
alumni and friends?” As I have
thought over this question, I
have reached several tentative
answers.

Grinnell‘s reputation is based
in pan, 1 think, on the con-
tinuous stream of talented
students it has attracted, on
the scholarly attainments cf
its faculty, and on the excel)»
tional distinction of its alumni.
But beneath these outward
signs, the true source of iis
strength, 1 think, has been its
constant dedication to the lib-
eral ans, its devotion to free-
dom of inquiry and freedom
of speech, iis consistent prac-
tice of democracy in every-
day campus life, its concern
for each individual student as
n distinctive person, and ihc
essential wholesomcncss of its
social life. And 1 think Grin-
nell has been able to hold fast
to iis principles because of its
traditional allegiance to Chris-
tian values.

”A Great Hen'tage"

Grinneli did not achieve its
enviable position automatically
or overnight, nor did it achieve
its reputation by slick advertis-
ing or by clever public relations.
l‘ts reputation is the product of

a long history of vision. leader~
ship, hard work, and loyally on
the part of the thousands of
students, faculty members, trust-
265, and friends who have pre-
ceded us over the past century.
It is up to us to carry on this
great heritage, and to convey the
college to the next generation
even better than we found it.

When 1 say that Grinnell is a
great college, i do not mean to
imply that it IS Without prob
lems. Obviously, we could use
more money, Some new buildings
are needed. According to several
articles in Scarlet and Black the
students might be more interest
ed in campus affairs. The word
“apathy” appeared several times,

members, ihcy would tell me
that siudenls mighi be more in

and grade more generously. of
course there are problems at
Grinneliilarge ones and small
Ones (and someumcs the small
ones are more troublesome than
the large ones).

“An Urge to improve"

But the problems of Grin-
ncll can be faced with con-
fidence, when we consider the
basic soundness of the college.
thn the present problems are
solved, ns 1 am sure they will
be, they will be replaced by
other problems. A lively, viial
collcgc always has problems.
Awareness of them is a symp-
tom of the urge to improve.
By analyzing and facing up to
our problems we are able in
direct our efforts intelligently.
I earnestly hope that we shall
never be without problems—

The Sound'

and
The Fury
by Art Travers

A Plea for Liberalism:

l was glad to hear Dr. Bow-
en admit that Grinne‘ll has pr0b~
lems when he spoke last Sate
urday. Recognizing the prob-
lems is the first step towards
solving them. However, ii. 067
curs to me that recognizing
these probles Will be a fair-
ly hard job, and that correcting
them even harder.

Gl‘innell is a small collegc
with many obvious advantages,
Its scholastic record is excellent
and, after all, we are all here
to be educated, ostensibly at
least. The Grinnell faculty is
extremely well qualified to
handle their part in education,
but all the necessary education
‘dDES not come from books and
lectures, (All fight, 50 that’s a
trite remark)

It seems tu me that the basic
problem at Grinnell is one of
attitude, both on the part Of the

students and the administration. ‘

It has been said that college is
supposed to make adults from
children, and I don't believe
cnis can be done by stringent
regulation and enforced virtue.
And this brings us around to
hall picnics.

Now, it must be conceded that
the students themselves played
no small part in influencing the
administration to Crack down
this year. Certain incidents last
year brought outside pressure
m bear upon the administration
and the students have only
themselves to thank. But I have
enough faith in the student
body to believe that they will
be able to profit by last year’s

i akes, and not repeat them.
or some the hall picnic is a
chance to blow off some steam,
and that riot last Monday
probably occurred because the
normal method of letting their
hair down was denied. That
Monday riot might be the har-
binger of more violent things
to cum. Let's hope not.

For others. it is. as a recent]1
editorial in this.paper put it,
an initiation. Perhaps it isn‘t
the best initiation: perhaps it
isn‘t even a good one, but it is
far better than the same sort
of initiation later on, n is much
nicer (God! how I hate the
word "nice".) to be initiated
at a place and time which will'
not lead to a drunken brawl or
a rolling. Any person who is
not able to take care of hime
sclf after these picnics is
brought home and put to bed
by his friends. That will not
be the case in the army, nor'
can you expect some barroom
slut to do it. College is the
proper place.

There is nothing in the rulesl
that you must drink at these
parties either. For many it is
a chance to go out wiLh a hunchl
of the guys and sing songs or‘
tell smutty stories and relieve
the tension which lS inwardly?
accumulating. l

It may be a little late for al
plea of this sort for this year,
but there are years to come. It
seems to me that this is a two
way proposition, If the admin-
istration wants the students toi
act like adults, treat them like
adults. if the students wish to
be treated like adults, they‘
should act like them. We canl
work together on this rather‘
than tread conflicting paths.
Why don’t we reach an under-«
standing and put the “liberal"l
back in “liberal arts.”

Well, thank heaven 1 can put
the soap box away for a whilc.
I always feel uncomfortable
upon it.
because problems represent a ,
kind of creative dissatisfaction
that will spur us on t0 build n

So i for one approach ihc come
