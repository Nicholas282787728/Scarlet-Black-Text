:Concert fund debated

by T. Elaine Carey
Should expenditure guidelines be
"i’ormulated by SGA for the Con-
certs Committee? Should a special
budget be set. up within the SGA
social budget to cover expenses,
such as entertaining artists per
forming at Grinnell? Should all
such expenses be written into the
artists’ contracts?

Some SGA members are posing
these questions due to a recent
controversy over the spending at
the concert funds this year.

7 About two weeks ago, Student
Auditor Mike Herman called
Concerts Committee _ Co-
Chairpersons Dan Meltzer and
Carlson Smith to discuss some
hills, which had been accumulated
by the committee, Herman said.

Herman explained that the bills
were [or meals at local
.restaurants, which Meltzer and

Smith had charged to the Concerts
Committee. Three dinners and one
breakfast were billed to the
committee, said Meltzer and
Smith.

First semester. Herman
received a bill from BJ’S
restaurant for $137.15, he said.
Having never received a
restaurant bill before, Herman
contacted SGA Treasurer Mark

*Nissen and President Will Collins.
VBoth Collins and Nissen agreed to
check into the matter, Herman
said. Herman did not pay the bill
until he received approval from
Collins.

The bill, which was for 11 dine
ners, included $35.35 for liquor and
beer, $83.80 [or food. and $18 for a
tip, the receipt shows, The tive
Rahsaan Roland Kirk band
members, Charles and Dale Davis,
Meltzer, Smith, and two triends
ate, Meltzer said. The $14,901or the
friends’ meals was paid back
within a few days, they said,

Herman accepted this
repayment and Collins‘ approval

’and so dropped the matter, he said,
«But the matter surfaced again at
the beginning at this semester
when the auditor was billed for
iheals again.
When the total first semester
* bills added up to over $300. Herman
said he began to question whether
the meals were the “correct thing
to do,” and whether ”they (Meltzer

i and Smith) might be over—doing
it.” Since the dinners “cost so
much," Herman didn‘t think their
benefit was ”worthwhile," he said.
The Concerts Committee was
budgeted ior moon first semester.
Herman talked to Nissen again
who agreed with Herman that the

iexpenditure was “questionable.”
Herman said,

Meltzer, Smith, and Herman met
to discuss the spending. Herman
said. Meltzer outlined their

. reasons for the expenditures,
merman said

Repeating those reasons in an
8&5 interview, Meltzer said
“treating musicians

‘ professionally” was a major
reason for the meals. Noting that
the “whole music profession is
very extravagant,” Meltzer exa

.‘ plained that ”you don’t treat
human beings any other way than

,withrespec ” and that Grinnell has

a “good reputation" in this area,

which has attracted artists, such
as Kirk, and, in some cases,
brought substantial price reduc-
lions.

“It is expected,” Meltzer said,
and ”not proper" to not pay for
motels and meals tor performers,

Calling the spending in such an
area “a very gray matter,"
Meltzer and Smith said they used
their judgment to handle the
situation and “the way we saw it
was to treat them courteously."

At this meeting with Meltzer and
Smith, Herman said he Wanted the
spending stopped. When Meltzer
questioned by what authority
Herman Could make such a
demand, Herman said that he
admitted that he had no authority,
but he would bring the matter to
SGA.

When the meeting broke up,
Meltzer said he would talk to
Smith, who had been unable to
attend, Herman said,

After that meeting, Herman said
Nissen told him that not all the
ticket money from the Bruce
Springsteen concert had been
turned in to the auditor. Some
money had been used trom the
ticket cash to pay tor groceries and
pizzas, Meltzer and Smith said.
The groceries were for the band
and were a stipulation in their
contract. The pizzas were ordered
tor Springsteen's road crew and
the students who helped Clean up,
they said. Since it is often difficult
to keep people to clean up after a
concert, they believed the pizzas
were necessary ”incentive" tor the
cleanup crew.

Until Herman found out from
Nissen, he had thought that all the
ticket money had been turned in
from the concert.

Herman, Collins. Nissen,
Meltzer, and Smith agreed that the
Springsteen concert had problems,
because difficulties developed in
ticket distribution.

Tickets for the concert were sold
at the Forum Desk by desk at-
tendants, Meltzer and Smith said,
Since they Couldn't Work all the
time, they didn't have total control
over the tickets and money.
Distribution became confused
when tickets for 1D card holders
ran out and tickets to be sold were
given free to lo card holders, they
explained. Meltzer and Smith said

they were unable to determine how'

many tickets were sold, due to the
distribution problems.

Herman, Meltzer. and Smith met
again about a week and a half ago
to rediscuss the matter. Herman
said. At this meeting, in addition to
talking about the Springsteen
ticket money, Herman said that he
didn't have receipts for many
purchases. Herman admits,
though, that he hadn't asked for
receipts trom them. nor does he
regularly request anyone to submit
receipts. Meltzer and Smith hadn‘t
been asked for receipts, and didn’l
know they needed receipts, but had
kept the receipts for a couple of
months betore throwing them
away, they said.

Herman objected to Meltzer and
Smith receiving salaries for
working at the Springsteen cons
cert, since they are salaried for
concerts, but he paid them at the

time without questioning, he said.

Last year, the concerts chair.
person also was paid twice for
working concerts, the books in-
dicate, Meltzer and Smith have not
been paid ior work at any other
concert, Herman said.

Three agreements were reached
at the meeting, Herman said.
Meltzer and Smith agreed to keep
an explicit journal of their ex-
penditures, retain all receipts, and
not to go out to eat, Herman said,
Meltzer and Smith said they did not
agree to not go out to eat, but
agreed to keep their expenses
down Herman said he would pay
for groceries to entertain artists in
their apartment, though, which
was the practice last year. Ac-
cording to the books, the concerts
chairperson was reimbursed
approximately 330 lor groceries
last year.

“I might have overstepped my
office,” Herman said at his part in
the matter, “I had gotten really
involved and it seemed no one
cared or wanted to say anything
about it," he added,

“l'd known from the beginning or
the year (about going out to eat
with artists)," Collins said, adding
“they had my explicit per-
mission.” Collins expressed sur-
prise at how upset Herman was.

Money was spent in ways which
were not “wise judgment,” Collins
said, and “they didn’t keep close
enough records for Springsteen
and they shouldn't have been paid
a salary,but they have been quite
open about it."

The Springsteen expenditures
were handled “loosely," which left
Meltzer and Smith open to
Criticism, but the SGA president
emphasized that ”there was
nothing crooked going on."

Collins accepts that entertaining
the artists can make them perform
better and that it helps the
reputation of the college. but he
added that he might have done it
more conservatively.

Nissen concurred with Collins
saying, “they have not demon
strated the businesslike ac-
counting methbds.” Nissen can’t
tell how many Springsteen tickets
were sold and the voucher system
was not observed, he said.

Brian Mann, social coordinator,
who oversees the concerts
program, agreed with Meltzer and
Smith, particularly on the point
that taking artists out was a
professional courtesy, which aids
the concerts program.

Meltzer, Smith, and Collins do
not want guidelines drawn up for
concert expenditures, they said,
Collins said guidelines leave
loopholes and he’d rather trust
people than guidelines.

Herman doesn‘t want guidelines
either because “when Mr
penditures are necessary, why go
through an actor Congress to get. $5
tor soft drinks . . they just com-
plicate procedures. i don’t tllink
guidelines are the answer," the
auditor said,

Any expenditures should be
included in the signed contract
with artists, Nissen said, instead of
setting guidelines. He also
recommends that the auditor in-
struct people about what to do.

Grinnell College
Grinnell, lowa

Saga terminated;
McConnell hired

byJanetPope

“Saga’s been canned.” The
scoop was all over South Campus
Tuesday night and rapidly spread
to North. This time it Was not just
another rumor. The college has
contracted with David McConnell,
currently manager of the straw
town inn, in Fella, to manage a
college-operated food service.
Saga‘s contract Will not be
renewed for next year, announced
President A, Richard Turner.
McConnell will take over on July 1.

Both President Turner and
Waldo Walker, dean of the college,
stated that the switch was made
for economic reasons. They both
said that the decision was made in
hopes that the college can run their
own food service at reduced costs.
However, Walker provided no
figure on the expected reduction,

Both. emphasized that it was not
dissatisfaction with Saga that led
to the decision. “I have heard less
dissatisfaction with Saga in the last
nine months than in the last five
years," Walker commented. Both
said that Keenan Roberts, food
service director had done an ex
cellent job.

Walker explained that the food
service decision depends a lot on
the people available at the time, He
said that if McConnell hadn't
contacted him, the College would
probably have contracted Saga for
another year. Eighteen years ago,
the college switched from their
own food service to Saga because
they were having difficulties
finding managers, Walker said.

Walker said that he hoped the
switch would mean that the college
could get by with smaller raises in
board Costs in future years. He also
said that he hoped the new
arrangement would provide funds
for purchasing ‘capital equipment
for the cateterias..iic explained
that this money has been coming
out of the general fund.

McConnell acted as manager of
Quad three years ago. He is en
thuslastlc about returning to
Grinnell. “I've been associated
with college food services for ten
years. i happen to enjoy it,” he
commented. “My interest is to
provide students of Grinnell \\‘ith
the best possible food service."

McConnell stated lhat there
would be no radical changes in the
food, He did say. however, that
students could expect “improved

quality and improved customer
relations.“ Juniors and seniors
who ate at Quad three years ago
commented favorably about
McConnell‘s service.

Humanism in dealing with
students was cited by McConnell as
an important part of a food service,
He said that the atmosphere in the
cafeteria is important. He men-
tioned that when he was manager
oi Quad he knew a majority of the
students by first name.

“The food service is for the
students,” McConnell said. At
several points he mentioned that,
by way of student input, the tood
service can be as good as the
students want it to be,

McConnell will actively manage
Quad. He will have an assistant
who will be in charge of Oowles. He
and Robert Anderson, treasurer of
the college, will keep the books
together. Walker mentioned that
this would enable a monthly
examination of food service
finances. which is Impossible now,

Walker said that McConnell
wrote him a letter in October and
that negotiations have been going
on ever since. Turner explained
that it was necessary to keep the
negotiations quiet to protect Mc-
Connell’s position at Strawtcwn
Inn,

Linda Cornelius, Marca Fox and
Joanne Pyes, members of the Food
and Facilities Subcommittee,
expressed anger and disap.
pointment over the fact that they
were not informed about the
negotiations. Several weeks ago
they were intormed by Ralph
Pomerenk, director of college
services, that no negotiations were
taking place.

Bill Schuster, Quad manager
agreed that it was a logical
decision, commenting that he was
surprised the college hadn't made

decision. “From their point of
view, it mlghl be a good move in
terms of dollars and cents," he
commented

Wayne Cliinander. manag ~ at
Cowlcs, said that he was surprised
at the decision He explained that
the Saga managers \iere not in
tormed until Tuesday night.
“We’re sorry to leave.” be com.
merited. “We wish the college and
the students good luck. We'll be
happy to return.” Roberts could
not be reached [or comment. -
