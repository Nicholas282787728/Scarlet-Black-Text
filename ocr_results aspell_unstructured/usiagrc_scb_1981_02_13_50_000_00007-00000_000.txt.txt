Kesul’l’ct‘liiig on old liadtiiun is
one purpose behind the lucuity/studeiil
cul‘lce hours sponsored by the Mortar
Board 52nd board member Vuluric
Lloyd,

Another reason according to Lloyd is
that 'too many sludiiets on campus
dun tgel to utilize out-greatest resource
which is our prulcssors. So the Mortar
Board has set up u series oi coiiee hours
during tthich scvoral dillei-cnt pro
te 'tlrbyiill give inlormul discussions.

Vthose topics have not yet been decided.

The prolessors choose their ovui
topics lol’discussmni The Mortar Board
Cl'llel‘ht lor these Subjecls are that they
be scholarly. have meaning in contenr
porary times and that the proiessor be
genuinely interested in the topic.

The Mortar Board, part at a national
organization, is an older group on cam»
pus that was originally comprised only
01 women. Men were inducted into the
group about eight years ago and vtere
previously organized as the l-‘riai-s.

The Mortar Board used it) provide
many activities such as the collee hours
but about the nine men were admitted

to the group the number or its activities
began declining, said Lloyd, Organizar
tmns such as the Women's Group, the
Young Republican and the coalition
against the Nev. Right sprang up to
compensate lor the loss of the activities
iormerly provided by the Mortar
Board. The board feels that
establishlng the cottee hours for laculty
and students is a step toward making it
more active in campus aliairs again.

Since it is an honorary society the
new Mortar Board members are
selected by those already in the group
on the basis oi their Junior year grade
point average and an essay stating vthy
they Wanl to and should be admitted,
Selections for next year 5 members will
be made this spring and the present
board hopes me new people will con-
tinue the coltee hours,
