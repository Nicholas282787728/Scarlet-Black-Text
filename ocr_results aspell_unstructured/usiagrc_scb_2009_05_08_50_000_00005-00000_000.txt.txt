Wolverine:

broken character

Christine McCormick bemoans
today’s invincible superheros.

DC Comics doesn't understand one important
thing about superheroes. Their poster boy, Superman,
While interesting on an academic level, is too invincible
to be exciting. You can’t outrun him, you can't be stronger
than him and you can’t even shoot him. You don't stand
a chance unless you have some rare kryptonite. and he
would probably just pick up some lead to block it anyway.
Superman not only beats you, he gives you lead poisoning.

That’s whyl have always preferred Marvel Come
ics. Their characters are falliblei they can be defeated.
SpiderrMan's victories are always hardrfought, At the
very least, Marvel's heroes are plagued by moral quandar
ties and major character flaws, especially the XsMen.

As a kid, I always thought Wolverine was one of the
coolest XsMen. He has claws! Unbreakable claws! He can
heal faster than the average personl He can make yellow
and blue spandex look not hotriﬁcl (That last one,I think,
is his real mutant superpower.)

But now I realize that Marvel's gone too fat,
Wolverine is becoming invincible.

He definitely didn't start that way. Wolverine
wasn't one ofthe original eren created by stan Lee and
Jack Kirby in September 19oz. He debuted ll years later
in an issue of“The Incredible Hulk" as a stocky little sue
perhuman agent of the Canadian government, which is
quite cool. He joined the XsMen a year later, bringing
along amazing spandex and a mutual but unfulfilled crush
on Jean Grey, girlfriend ofteam leader Cyclops (aka. the
one with laser eyes).

In the late 70s, when he first appeared, his heal—

ing power was limited to merely an accelerated healing of
small wounds.

But as of last June, he was able to regenerate his en»
tire body (bones and all) after being caught in a nuclear
explosion. He has also grown about a foot taller and is
no longer an ugly, stocky, angry little Canadian man with
claws. He’s invincible.

How do you defeat a mutant with a skeleton of
adamantium (the only thing stronger than adamantium is
Captain America’s Vibraniumsalloy shield) who is able to
recover from a nuclear bomb blast? You don't.

There are other Marvel characters like Jean Grey
who could literally destroy the entire world if she felt like
it. She‘s an Omega-level mutant, but she still dies. Yes,
she comes back eventually, but she can actually die. Wol—
verine once had his skeleton ripped out by Magneto. But
it doesn't kill him, he recovers rather quickly, and then is
revealed to ‘have claws of bone. It doesn’t seem like Wol—
verine can actually die. EverThis is annoying.

Then there are minor characters who could also de-
stroy the world. but thankfully aren't invincible. Take
Gambit. In “Uncanny X»Men” #313, he charges a ship's
anchor, which Storm [hClI throws at the Phalanx, blow-
ing the Phalanx to pieces, Gambit's power could evolve to
the ridiculous heights ofWolverine’s power, but it doesn't.
He’s lettered by the limits of magical realism. Why isn't
Wolverine?

video games have this concept when a champ
ter or a weapon is basically impossible to defeat, giving
one side an annoying and insurmountable advantage. I
t's ii “broken weapon” or a “broken character."It's fine that
Wolverine has become one of Marvel's ﬂagship gruffanr
tihero characters, but the fact that he’s becoming the only
important and invincible XsMan is totally unfair.

Mutants are already cooler than us normal peas
ple, what with the mind reading and the explosions and
the powers of flight. so why does Wolverine need to be
invincible? Why do any of thorn need to he invincible? if
there's anything l've learned at Grinnell, it's that flaws and
vulnerabilities make people more interesting. Wolverine
these days is just an invinciblejoke.

When did you become interested injapanese art?

I guess I’ve always liked Japanese wood cuts, 1 was in a 300
drawing class with Lee Running, [Art] and she
showed me a book of sketches I really liked
those.

What are your plans for after gtaduaﬁon?

I am actually working on a farm until oc—
tober. I've worked for the same guy for two
years. He runs an organic farm. The farm has
been in his family for ﬁve generations. This
summer it is being treated a lot more like an
internship than in the past I think it would
be pretty ideal in could eventually be able to
farm in the summer and then make art for the
other part of the year.

Have you ever thought about what appeals to you about
farms and the Midwest landscapes so much?

one ofthe reasons is that it's just such a visual thing, there's
so much to it, with all ofthe patterns. rhythm. all the row crops,
all the colors and all the buildings llnd machinery. And when I
work on a farm I feel like it really brings me closer to the land,
so ‘it feels natural to want to pursue what I’m interested in, in my
life and in my artwork as well.

What inspired your series in the Student Salon?
The titles are all lines from John Donne poems and I just
decided to take the words a lot more literally than he meant

thorn to be taken.

Do you have a favorite piece of the ones in the Student Sat
Ion.>

I really like the piece with the hands called “Batter my heart
tlirce pctson’d God." It came out ofa Grrnnell Plans comets

sation with a friend of mine who was in Traditions of English
Literature 1. I mentioned that a John Donne line would make
a great title for a memoir and she responded, "Batter my heart
three person'd God" would make a great title for a cook book.

What do you like about working with pottery?

It's a really fun experience, its a lor ottechni-
cal skill and it doesn't always come out the way
you want because of the kiln

What are your plans for your future as an
artist?

Well I am a Studio Art and Psychology dou-
ble major, and Iwant to become an architect and
study urban designl want to look at how archir
tecnrre affects people psychologically. I want to
be more on the design aspect than the technical
drafting end.

What’s the story behind your series of photographs?

My friend showed me that 1 could unscrew rhe peephole
from my door [and] I decided ra shoot through it. using it as
a second lens and just experimented and played around with it,

You also did avideo, what was the story behind that?

It's called “The Being of my Tree." My idea was to make a
Stopsmotion video but instead ot’nsing clay I got the idea to
draw on my body. 1 did some sketches and in the end i wanted
to do something which would show how the body connected
to Nature and how they come together and become one being.

Do you see a common theme throughout all ofyour work,
no matterwliat the medium?

1 gmess a lot or the work i do is me trying to blend fantasy
and reality togetherl want to look at things in a new way, which
goes back to thc pccphole idea of being able to see something
that is everyday and common, through this lens into a distorted
world, '
