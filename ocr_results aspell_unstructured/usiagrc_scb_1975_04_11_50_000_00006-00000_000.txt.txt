Grand jury
"to probe
obscenity

The county attorney, Don Schild,
has asked the Poweslllck County
Grand Jury to investigate alleged
dissemination of obscene
materials to minors in Poweshick
County which would be violations
of Chapter 725 of the 1975 Code of
Inwn.

Schild, in a statemcnt released
earlier this Week‘ said that he was
pursuing the matter on the basis oi
complaints that his office has
received The complainants'
names have been withheld upon
their request by Schild. “I do not
want someone to feel that it they
inform me as to what they believe
is criminal activity they will
automatically be announced to the
liews media," Schild Stated.

The statement did not name any
particular violations but stated
specitically that the investigation
was “to include the Grinnell»
Ncwburg School System.” The
grand jury, however, could in-
vestigate any violations related to
the dissemination of obscene
materials.

Another possible area of his
vestigation is the Varsity News
Stand In Urlnnell which last week
received complaints concerning
alleged obscene material that was
in law of minors.

Cooper School purchased

The old Cooper School has been bought {rpm the Grinnell-
Ncwburg School System. tor $43,000, by Harry Ritter, a local
business man. The property is located adjacent to the college on the
corner of East Street and Highway 6.

The school has been closed since the spring ot 1973, and, upon
approval ol a proposal to sell the school by the district's voters last
tail, was placed up ror public auction Wednesday.

It was thought that at one point the college would be a bidder on
the property. College Treasurer Robert Anderson said that the
college trustees had reached a tinal decision this week not to bid on
the property. Anderson disclosed that any college bid would have
been “substantially lower” than the tinal purchase price, Another
factor Involved in the decision was that the college Could not

foresee any direct purpose tor the property except that it was
adjacent to college land.

Ritler plans to knock down the school, lirst opened in January or
1900, and build “condominiums”. No (late lor the luture cons
siruction was indicated by Ritter.
