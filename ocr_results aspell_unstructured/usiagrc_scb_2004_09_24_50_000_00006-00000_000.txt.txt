Food factory facts

The Monsanto Company and Wildwood Harvest Foods, both food factories
located just outside Grinnell, make the best out of Iowa’s corn and soybeans

BV LINN DAVIS

Let’s face itimost of the state of Iowa is covered with two
things: corn and soybeans. Grinnell has a surprisingly large hand
in each. During the past three years, the Monsanto Company,
the world's largest maker ofgenetically-modified corn seed, and
Wildwood Harvest Foods, a national producer oforgimic soy
foods, built large factories just outside the city. Although they
are certainly very different, they are both putting Grinncll on
the corn and soybean map.

Monsanto

Surrounded, not surprisingly, by corn, this
gigantic complex of buildings can be seen
from miles away. The parking let alone is
about the size of central campus. Essentially,
the factory processes and packages 30 variet-
ies of corn seed primarily used by Midwest
farmers. After residing on Hwy. 6 near the
Facilities Management office for many years,
Monsanto, which had acquired the previous
DeKalb brand in 1998, agreed to move the
Grinnell operation to a safer, larger and more
modern facility

The packaging process is hardly as simple as it seems. The
corn is unloaded, put on a conveyer belt, un-husked, dropped
onto another conveyor belt and released into a giant drying bin.
This all happens in a matter or minutes. After sitting in the due
ers, which are each powered by ioorhorserpowcr fans, for three
days, the cats travel up a carnivulrsliderlike conveyor belt to the
top of the tallest building at the facility.

At this point the seed kernels look like uncooked popcorn.
They are then meticulously separated by size and shape, and any
remaining impurities are weeded out. After falling through a
noisy maze of computer-operated machines, the sweet-smelling
corn is ﬁnally chemically treated and packaged into large bags

This is the exciting life ofa corn seed.

first frost sets in, the plant is busy processing corn 24/7. Packag—
ing started last weekend and will run until December.

According to manager Al Henderson, every year the factory
produces about half rt million bags of corn seed, with one bag
containing an average of 80,000 kernels. If the average coin-
mercial farincr plants approximately 35,000 kernels per acre, the
Grinnell facility supplies sced for about 1.1 million acres of land,
at around 1.4 percent ofthe total com sccd used by US, farmers.
In other words, that’s a lot.

But it certainly isn't all work and no play. For the most part,
a laidrback atmosphere prevails at Monsanto. In a touch ofhur
mor, the [actory's computer control system is
made like a video game, with an interactive
picture of the plant, moving trucks and all.

The plant employs 30 full-time work-
ers, but during the labor-intensive Juneriuly
de-tasselling time, this number increases to
several times that, with many workers coming
from the Grinnell community

“We haven't been vety successful over the
years in getting Grinnell College snidents to
work here," Henderson said, “Most students
want to go home, and I don’t blame [them]."

Monsanto, however, has had contact with the school at oth-
er times of the year. Students have participated in internships
there, and John Andelscn, Anthropology, occasionally takes his
tutorial and Culture/Agriculture classes to the factory.

Wildwood

Located inconspicuously behind the Days Inn near Inter-
state 80, the Wildwood factory is surprisingly smallThe com-
pany, which distributes its organic soy-based products to health
food stores across the country has existed in Grinnell since 1998,
when Tom and Alesia Lacina, who operate a thirdrgentration
family farm just north of town, formed Midwest Harvest and
began making tofu,

“It was seriously the best tofu that's ever been made," said
Aaron Pierce, who works in marketing and information tech—
nology “It was amazrng,”

in the summer of 2001, while the Monsanto factory was
getting its finishing touches, Midwest Harvest merged with
Wildwood Natural Foods ofCalifornia, and in 2002, the Grins
nell branch or the company moved to its new locationThe local
operation now only produces the company’s cultured products,
such as soy yogurrs and smoothies, but the workforce has grown
from two employees to 22.

“it's a great place to work," said Pierce. “1 love working
here.”

The plant consists of one sleek, gray building with office
cs—soine of which are more orderly than olhcrsitwo storage
rooms, a culturcemaking room with huge retmcntation vats, a
testing room and a packaging room, Everything is made from
the raw ingredients onsite, and much of the soybean supply
comes from local sources.

VViltlwood also has some links to the college. According to
Pierce, the tofu in the dining halls used to be supplied by Mid-

company since the beginning. Wildwood’s products, however,
are not sold anywhere on campus.

“We'd love to get [our products] into Bob’s and the Forum,’
Pierce said. “I think they'd do really well there."

Value for students

Although the presence of companies such as these is an un-
mistakable economic resource for the town of Grinnell, it also can
provide educational opportunities for students at the college.

“It helps students know something more about where they
are for four years, and 1 take that for an obvious good," said Ann
delson. “For many suidents, Iowa, especially natal Iowa, repre
sents something very different than they're used to, so they learn
sorncthing about a different setting in the United States."

In addition, Andelson classiﬁes it as the handsron “discovery
mode" of learning and uses local busrncsses to compliment in~
class study.

“What a great option—to go out to Monsanto and learn
about farming from their point of view or to go out to an or-
ganic farmer and see what he’s doing," Andelson said. “Tlicrc
are a lot of very interesting and very knowledgeable people in
and around Grinnell, and students from the college can learn a
lot from them."

Apparently even corn and soy can relate back to schoolwork
somehow.
