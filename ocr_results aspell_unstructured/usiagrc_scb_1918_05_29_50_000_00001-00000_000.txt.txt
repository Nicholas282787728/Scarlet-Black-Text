BUMBARDMENT DF LUNG!

RANGE GUN DN PARIS

Shells Hit‘ Only Two Blocks Dis-
tanhiDo Comparatively Lit-
tle Damage to City

SAYS FALLING STONES DO
MORE DAMAGE THAN GUN

Turning of American Forces To
French Command Has Great
Effect on Morale

In a lctter recently received here
from a. Grinnell alumnus noiv in thc
United States Army service in Par-rs,
he describes in an interesting manner-
the effect of the German long range
gun bombardment on the French cap-
ital. The name of the alumnus is
withheld by request.

The letter follows in part:

"Of course you have been reading of
the long range gun and how it hit
a church on Good Friday and killed
seventy-ﬁve people It was the falling
stones which did the damage to the
people for the shell exploded when it
hit the root, Last evening 1 went out
for a walk to look at some of the shell
holes which had been made near the
hotel during the day. They were
shooting all around us yesterday ate
tel-noon. the‘ near-est shell hitting
about tivo blocks aw .

Shell Holes Large

”The shell holes are very large,
sometimes hve feet deep but the dam-
age done when they hit in the street
is almost incredibly small. When a
bomb from an a plane hits in the
street it nearly always breaks all the
windows within ﬁfty yards and often
all within one hundred yards. 0n the
other hand these shells tail to break
windows twenty feet aivay. Only two
or three panes will be broken where
stones or rnissils form the shells hap-
pen to hit The reason is that the
shell is very thick and of very tough
steel so that it breaks into a few large
-pieces and most of the energy is used
just in breaking it.

“They killed only eight people yes-
terday, not a _very large number out
of the millions' in and around ‘the city,
so unless the bombardment becomes
heavier we need not worry. What
concerns us all much more is the
Roche oifensive and there seems to be
ever-y reason to be cheerful about that
for tonight's communique says that the
Boche has been held solid for twenty-
four hours.

French Coniruiinil Americans

"I do wish you could see the ehect
that the turning of the American Eel-cs
es over to the French command for the
battle has had on the French people.
It is looked on here as the ﬁnest act
connected with the war. It has had
the immediate effect of stiffening the
backbone of the nation immensely.

BOOK IS DEDICATED .

Men in Service

Rudcly awakened from their peacer
tul slillllbcr's by the heating plant
whistle and the chapel bell just after .
ilrc sun. in any except the rainy sea,
son. would have been peeping over the
eastern borizen, Grinnell students
stir-red uneasily, rubbed their eyes,
set up in bed in a half-dazed condi-
tion, and ﬁnally became alive to the
fact that those phantom things come
inonly known as “Cyclones" were out
this morning.

All this happened in the minutes
which elapsed between 6:00 and 6:05,
although a few of the wiser ones who
lived within the scene of action were
aware as early as midnight that the
"big circus" was to be staged at the
“Y" this morning. Beginning at 5:10,
streams of “sleepy-heads“ began pour--
ing in, and the mysteries of the 1919
Cyclone were revealed to the world.

Dedicated to Rnwsori

The book this year is dedicated to
Charles Rawson, of Des liloines, a for-
nier student and a hearty supporter of
the college. This is the ﬁrst time that
a Grinnell annual has ever been dedi»
cated to anyone except a faculty mem-
her.

The opening section is devoted to
campus scenes,,and contains many
excellent cuts. The feature of the
book, however, is the military section,
consisting of cuts of a large iriiniber
of Grinuell men in service, aside from
soy ral views of camp life. Every
Grinnellian known to be in any branch
of the army or navy is listed in an
alphabetical index. This section also
contains a resume of the women‘s war
work.

The inserts, in nine color-s, are
among the finest which has ever ap
peared in any Grinnell publication,
while the subtitle pages are exception-
ally a istic.

The junior and administration sec-
tions are cleverly arranged, and the
athletic departments are new in every
respect.

War Savings and Thrift Stamps are
the most secure and safe savings op»
porturrity ever presented to the people
of any nation.

The following letter was received

thc Roy al Aviation Force.

“I am in England attached to the
Royal Aviation Force. They have
wonderful machines her-e and they
the same thoroughly, having been at
it for four years. I have always con-
sidered myself lucky to bc with them,

"England isn't a half bad place, even
now. Men and women in uniform pro-
dominate everywhere. The civilian is
becoming a rarer animal every day.

“All the English speaking parts of
the world are represented at this aero-

zenland. South Africa, England and
the United States. The difficult trues-
rions as to which is the nrost desir-
able part of the globe is still a long
way from being settled.
