Chinese ‘Minister States That
Twentieth Century Marks
Cultural Revival.

"China is now passing through a.
period of Renaissance in her educa-
tional life,” declared Sap-Kc Alfred
Sze, Envoy Extraordinary and Minis.
tcr Plenipotentiary, in his address in
Her-rick chapel Monday night. The
general subject which the Chinese
minister followed was the trend of
modern education in China but he
confined his remarks at the outset to
two main topics, the question of find<
ing a common language for all Chi-
nese and the problem of illiteracy.

In the first part of his speech Mr.
Sze stated that learning had always
becn greatly respected in China but
that up until recently learning had
largely been a matter of individual
concern and had never been consider-
ed in its social aspects. This old
system was somewhat rudely shaken
by the Boxer uprising and the begin-
ning of the present century saw Ch
na following ilrc steps of Japan in
adopting western education.

The Revolution of 1911 again jolted
China to its foundations and again the
educational system was changed. this

was greatly handicapped by the ab-l

as Moran was unable to hold his pitv

Building Three scored once in the
first inning on an error at second, and
a two hugger by Moran, Six failed

DUAL WIiH BKLAHHMA
SliiEﬂ EUR—SATURDAY

DOPE POINTS TO CLOSE
CONTEST WITH SODNERS

Favorable Traci; Climate Gives
Sooners Slight Edge in
Some Events.

Advance dope points to a close
fast meet next Saturday when the
Oklahoma cinder artists come here for
thc fir-st dual inset of the Pioneers'
season. The Southerners have the
advantage of being able to train out-
doors practically ail season, while the
wearers of the Maltese cross , have
been able to use the track for only
two or three weeks. However, a dual
meet is always won on seconds and
thirds, and ”Doc" Huff will have a
fast squad of athletes entered.

The Grinncll team will be seriously
handicapped by the loss of Jones, pre—
mier sprilllgr, who has a twisted am:
his, so Scharnweber and Green will be
depended upon to take points in the
dashes. Lindsay is the Sooners‘ best
bet in these events, although they
have four fairly fast men in the races,
as their quarterrmile relay team won
their heat at the Kansas relays in
:4419. Lindsay has done the fifty
yard dash in :52, and should be able
to run the hundred, and the furlong
in :10.1 and :221 which will in all
probability be fast enough to win.

Oklahoma is not so strong in the

hurdles, and Taylor should take those
events, although the southern team
has a man in the low sticks who is
considered pretty good. According
to the dope the Sooners should have
the edge on Crinnell in the 440 and
the mile. as they have a quarterumiier
who has done :51.4, and also a good
milcr, but they are not so strong in
the llalhuile and two.mile.
In the field events. Gr—inrrell should
win the shot put. hut the others are
doubtful. Oklahoma is reputed to
have a good polc vaulter, and in the
jhvelin throw Cox made‘ 171 feet. 101/:
inches at the Khnsas Relays, Ellison
is a Sooner discus man who has toss-
ed the platter 135 feet, and it is not
known how strong they are in the
broad jump and high jump.

In the relays, Grinnell's mile team
has the edge, and although the Pio—
neer hall-mile team ran it in 1:305,
at Ihe Drake Relays last week, with
Jones out Oklahoma will probably
