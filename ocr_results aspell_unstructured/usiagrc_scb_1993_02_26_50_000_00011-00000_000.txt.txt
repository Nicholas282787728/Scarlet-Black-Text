To the Editor:

As a first year student, my first
major experiences here at Grinnell
College were all of the events sure
roundingTammy Zywicki.Iwassad-
dcned and dumbfounded at the time,
butI was also very deeply moved. I
was stirred by the student response
and solidarity, the depth of feeling
that was articulated, and although
bome out of tragedy. the heights to
which thehuman spiritcan be raised.

So, now I must ask: What hap-
pened to Amelia Miller? The entire
Tammy experience was extraordir
narily open, people worked andcried
together in public, and helped each
otherthrough in avery positive way.
Two days after Amelia’s death, she
was gone. That is to say, the public
spirit of Amelia no longer manifested
itself, andpeoplewereleftto deal with
their feelings behind closed doors.

Why did this happen? Why the
marked distinction between the two
responses?

I aln by no means a certified
counselor or an expert in mental
health,but my every instincttelis me
that the only way that the Grinnell
community can heal and move on is
to have a catharsis. The only way to
achieve closure. which can be an ex-
traordinarily positive process, and not
suppress feelings, which can be dan-
gerous, is to talk about it. There needs
to be an open, forthcoming, and cola
lective discussion about this suicide.

I am puzzled that this did not
manifest itself as a matter of course.
It is almost as though the flowers
which graced the chapel in lhc late
summer have fallen under and given
way to the sometimes silent snow of
winter. No, there mustbesome reason

for the apparent change of seasons.

I believe that our human spirit,
which seeks to behealed,cannot heal
itself because there is a basic lack of
information concerning this suicide.
Thereis very little with which we can
come to terms; thus the dissonance.

Just from the point of view of
logic,we are leftwith two altentative
explanations. One is to assume that
Amelia shared similar struggles as
the rest of us and one night made a
devastating decision. But the implie
cations are terrifying: If Amelia was
just like me, how can I be sure thatl
won’t succumb to whatever it was
that took Amelia? Is suicide then a
part of life that we have to deal with?
Is it an unpreventable, even reason
able type of behavior?

Theotheraltemativeisthatthere
wassomething uniqueaboutAmelia‘s
journey and struggle. But for either
case,wejustdon’tknow.And conse-
quently, there is no way to heal.

The only way to begin to have a
catharsis is for all ofus to do ourbest
to create an atmosphere ofopenness.
I feel that we have a collective re-
sponstbilily to reexamine all availr
able infonrtatlon, however insignifi-
cant it may have seemed at the time.
I do not believe that anything less
than the venting of feelings and the
asking of questions can get us past
this turning pomt. There are simply
too many loose ends. Both in the
physical and spiritual sense, what
happened to Amelia Miller?

Language House

Decision 3 Mistake

ECENTLY, following a recommendation by fac-
ulty dean Charlie Duke. director ofstudcnt affairs

Torn Crady mandated the establishment of five
permanent language houses. In doing so, Tom bypassed
the student housing committee and its director Oda
Callison. He admitted at the SGA J ointBoard Meeting on
February 17 that he was unhappy with the way he made
this decision, although he supported it. I would agree that
the conceptofa language house is a good one ifit has the
support of its student occupants. I have a great deal of
difﬁculty with the way this decision was lnade.

Suppose that instead of being a student at Grinnell
College, I was a client at an advertising
firm,Oda wasan employee at that ftrm,and
Tom was the CEO. I may not be too well
informed about advertising techniques but
Iknow how I want my product to appear in
an advertisement. The advertising com-
pany assigns one of their employees to
work with me and help moet my needs
becausel am paying them a lot of money for theirservice.
That employee and I are working together well until the
CEO comes along and decrdes to advertise my product in
a completely different way titan his employee and Ihave
decided, despite the fact that I was pleased with the way
it was before. In the process, this CEO has bypassed the
system that he and his company have agreed to follow.
This company would be in deep trouble. The situation at
Grinnell is no different.

This analogy would be invalid if this decision im-
pacted faculty and staffas well asa curriculum orperson»
nel decision would. But it does not. This is a student life
issue concerning where we live. I would be wrong to

presume I had the authority to tell Tom how to behave in
his own house when he goes home each night. I do not
doubt that in this instance the administration and faculty
who supponed this decision believe they are acting in the
best interests of the student body, but it should be up to
the students to decide where and how we should live.

At no time in the Joint Board Meeting at which Tom
was ptosentdid he convince me ihata group of students with
strong backing from the language depanments and an
organized plan would not be capable of obtaining a house
through the housing committee following normal housing
procedures. Oda denied the housing committ/x was biased
against language houses, and I invite anyone with concrete
evidence to the contrary to bring it forth. Torn himself has
said that language houses will not work without the support
of students. Why not let students decide to have language
houses rather than watching adr
ministration-mandated language
houses suffer the same murky
fares as Russian and Chinese
houses. two previously estab-
lished “permanent language
houses" which are widely be-
lieved to have failed.

Finally, the vitality of the student body and the
college as a whole depends on its ability to atttaet
students who have an ability to think critically andassen
their own diverse identities. No one wants a classroom or
a house full of passive and apathetic students who would
rather be led than lead. Theability of the college to attract
such students is directly related to the opportunities those
individuals will have to express themselves here. In
general, the college is effective in doing this. But deci~
sions like the recent mandate to establish permanent
language houses are a step in the wrong direction. Any
funhcr Steps like this will encourage those individuals to
look for their education elsewhere.

 

 

 

Stains on the “Gorgeous Mosaic”

AVID Dinkins, the mayor of New York, is
D ﬁghting a tired battle for reelection. Few

people think he has a chanceofwinning. For
a while Dinkins was a fairly popular mayor, largely
because of his efforts to fight racism and crack down
on crime. But the dismal failure of these efforts,
reﬂected in ethnic strife and an escalating crime rate,
has made him the object of hatred and scorn.

In 1991. in the Brooklyn neigh-
borhood of Crown Heights, alew driv~
ing a limousine accidentally ran down
a ten-year-old black, Gavin Cato. The
boydtdnotsurvive. In rcsponsc,am0b
of blacks set upon a Jewish student.
Yankcl Rosenbattm, stabbing and kicking him.
Rosenbaum was brought to a hospital and died a few
hours later from loss of blood. Informed of what had
happened, Mayor Dinkins visited Cato’s family and
offered condolences, perhaps seeking to prevent fur—
ther explosions of black rage. He did not show any
sympathy for Rosenbaum’s familyiaware, perhaps,
that there is no danger of the Jews rioting.

Many members of Brooklyn’s Hasidic commu-
nity cametobelieve,perhaps irrationally,thatDinkins
had acquiesced in black antirSemitism. Early in 1992,
strange fliers bearing a photograph of Dinkins and the
words“Wanted forthe murderonankelRosenbaum"
began appearing in some sections of the borough.
During the summer of the salne year, angry Hasids
marched from their neighborhood in Brooklyn to
Manhattan, where they staged a fierce anti-Dinkins
demonstration.

At the beginning of his tenure as mayor, Dinkins
vowed to suppress the crime endemic to New York.
Four years later, the crime rate in the city is appallingly
high. In response to the murder ofBrian Watkins in a
subway station, Dinkins breezily remarked that the
crime rate is lower in New York titan in other Ameri-
can cities, but if you look at some of the other citiesi
say, Detroit or East St. Louis—this remark becomes

meaningless.

liberal media are likely to try to keep it that way. But
Innis may be lifted out of obscurity by the sheer
popularity of his beliefs: that black and white racists
are equally despicable, that the rapists and murderers
prowling the city are not “misunderstood kids" and
that they should be forcibly dealt with. Should Innis
be installed as New York‘s next mayor, he may
actually realize some of the goals of his left-wing
predecessor.
