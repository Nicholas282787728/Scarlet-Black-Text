has difficult week

Sports Information Ofﬁce

A difficult week erased the
hopes for post-season play by
the Grinnell College women’s
volleyball team. The Pioneers
posted a 7»19 overall record and
a 2-3 mark in the south diVlsion
of the Midwest Conference.

The top four teams of the
league’s two divisions will play
in an eight-team tournament at
the end of the season. Heading
into the last week the spikers
looked like they could sew up a
bid With a victory over Cornell.

But a loss to the Rams left
Grinnell with a 2-3 record and
tied with Coe and Knox. Both
those schools won the right to
play in the tournament on a tie
breaker system.

“It baSically came down to
“games for and against'," said
first-year coach Janette Tiekcn.
“Ironically, we beat second-
place Monmouth and Knox in
head-to-hcad competition, We
are definitely disappointed With
the outcome or last week, but it
is important to remember that we
are an extremely young team "

Last Tuesday the Pioneers fell
to William Penn, 154. 15-4 and
20-18 In the important match
of the week on Thursday,
Cornell downed Grinnell. 159,
6-15, 15-9 and 15-2 Oil Saturr
day William Penn and Grand
View both were victorious in it
triangular match,

“We really didn‘t do anything
to lose the Cornell match except
that we played a little tight. Our
team knew we had a tourttament
bid on the line while Cornell was
loose and playing with no strings
attached They got on tile and
we couldn’t stop their momen-
tum." said Tiekcn.

Given the task of coaching the
Pioneers two days aftet piaeticc

began, Tiekcn was forced to
build her squad around two rer
turning players and a host of
rookies. Senior Liz Nowacki,
who fought a leg injury all year,
completed a solid career, leavA
ing with school records in digs
and kills, The other veteran,
sophomoie Courtney Sapp, put
together another strong season.

“We are definitely gmng to
miss Liz. Now" is Courtney’s
team, Our major problem this
year was the inexperience of the
other players. We just need to
get more matches under our
belts.

“There is great potential in
our first-year players, Among
others, I liked the play of rookie
setter Amber Donahue, middle
hitter Sacha Stecnhoek and outr
side hitter Jamie Snider. The
key to our success in the future
is not talent because the talent
is there, We need to play with
confidence," said Tiekcn.

needed to move on to the champi-

Sunday the Pioneers met Lake
Forest for the title. Each squad had
numerous opportunities throughout
the first half which ended 0-0. “At
the half I told the team to stay far
cused and persistent and we would
be alright," Wood said.

The Pioneers followed that advice
and With only 25 minutes left
Goodspced scored off of a 23 yard-
direct kick to lead the Pioneers to a

14) Victory and their first conference
championship in three years,

a good sense of our abilities," said
Coach Wood. "Everyone played ex

doubtedly the MVP for the tourna-
ment because she made so many
amazing saves to keep us alive in
both games I am so proud ofcveryr

As the Pioneers look to next sea-
son they must face the challenge of
losing six starting seniors who played
pivotal roles this year. “It will be
tough to lose six players and we will
all miss them a great deal," remarked
Wood. “However. I am conﬁdent
that the younger players will step up
and be able to fill their shoes. This
was a great season and we will be
fightingiust as hard next year to de-
fend our title," she said.

"We got off to an outstanding start

Eitlly in the titst quarter the

Pioneers took it 9.0 advantage on
a 20 yard scantpcr from inn Hart

Nathan Salmose '00

Illinois College answered with

ard WCIHCI' '99. In the second

The Pioneers came out of the

locker room flat and gave up a
score midway through the third
quarter. “We had a lapse in the
third quarter," comm-tented Coach
Wallace, “1 think we may have
been overconfldent after playing
well in the first half " But at the
end of three quarters the Pioneers
were still ahead, 37-14. In the fir
rial period, Cotten mounted a 13,

Despite the subr.500 records,
however, Coach Wallace ex-
pressed his pride in the senior
class. “I was glad to see us win
that game tot the sake of the ser
niors," he said.

“When they arrived here we
were in the midst of a losing
streak and had not won a game in
two seasons. Now we have turned

I think our seniors have put us on

a good course for the future and
that is why 1 hate to see them
leave,"

While the Pioneers will miss
the 11 senior starters, there is
some room for optimism.
Grinnell returns a talented core of
skill players that has made a tre-
mendous impact this year, At the
same time the seniors will be dif-
ficult to replace. “Recruiting Will
be vital if we hope to flnish what
we have started here," said
Wallace.
