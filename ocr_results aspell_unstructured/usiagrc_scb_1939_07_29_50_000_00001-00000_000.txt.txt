It's a long jump from molasses in

seen fit to mention both during
the past year.

The most recent item,
appeared this week, follows:

Damage Levy

Shows Drop

Clark Highest in
Pro Kata Charge
Against Dormitories

Continuing the downward trend
of recent years. the pro rata dam-
age report for the men's halls,
released this week by the office
of the dean of men, showed an—
other drop in the average assess—
ment against each dormitoryres—
ident.

Clark hall, with a charge of
32 cents per man, led the dormi—
tories this year. other figures are:
Macy, 44 cents; Dibble, 33 cents;
smith, 30 cents; Langan, 25 cents;
Gates, 24 cents; Rawson, 15
cents; and Carney, no levy.

Last year, with iLangan having
a charge of $1.15 per man, the
average assessment against dormi-
tory residents was 45 cents.

Reductions in pro rata damage
have been obtained largely
through the adoption of individual
damage forms by the Council of
House Presidents, which place the
charge against the individual re-
sponsible for the damage rather
than the men of the ball as a
whole.

Before the adoption of this
form, the pro rata damage in a
single hall had been as high as
$3.90.
