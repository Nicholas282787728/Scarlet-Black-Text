Cornell 17-yard line.

The third and last Grinnell
touchdown came late in the last
quarter at the end of a dﬁeyzld
march. The score was made on
a. 15-yard pass, Walters to Nash,
hoth substitute backfield men. Hm
mann plunged over for the point
after touchdown.

Grinnell displayed an almost air-
tight defense holding Cornell to
four first downs, three of them
coming in the last half. The Pier
neer aerial attack heated that of
the Purple, the Scarlet and Black
toasers completing ﬁve passes for
so yards to three completions for
34 yards by the Purple.

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Expert Blocking.

Quick kicks by Fred Homann
kept the Cornell team well in
check at all times. Homann had a
41% yard average on his punts to
a 32-yard average tor the Cornell
punters. \

Long runs by Luther and Her
niann were aided immeasurably on
some expert olocking on the part
of the Grinnell team. Good block
ing and tackling are items that
usually are lacking on the Grin-
nell grid teams, but several times
during the game, Grimes anc‘t
Eaiohly crashed through the oppoi
sition to spill the hacks for losses.

Avenge o-o Defeatl

coach Guy Lookabaugll's char-
ges played together well to avenge
the so defeat suffered last year
at the hands of the Purple. The
Pioneers broke the winning streak
