Moines Register following an
Oct. l editorial, After receiving
the Bowen letter, the Register
corrected its inaccurate assump~
tions in a Wednesday editorial.)

October 2, 1958

Mr. Lauren K. Seth
The Des Moines Register and
Tribune

I seldom take exception to
anything 1 find on the editorial
page of the Des Moines Register.
I must, however, protest against
the implications of your editor-
ial of October 1 entitled, ”Col-
lege ‘Down Payment’ Plan."

The editorial refers to a pro-
posal Ihat students pay a ﬂee
posit toward their tuition at
the time they are accepted by
a college, Somec lleges, among
them Grinnell, have for many
years asked for such a deposit.
The~proposal is simply that
other colleges should adopt the
plan.

The editorial implies that.the
deposit is requested when the
student applies. This isfalse. The
deposit is required within ii?
teen days after theistudent is
accepted by the college. Upon
acceptance of the student, the
college guarantees him a room,
a place in the dining rooms, and
a place in the class rooms. At
this point. in fairness to stu-
dents on the Waiting list, the
college must be assured that the
applicant who has been admit-
ted will actually arrive in the
fall. The only practicable way
to assure this is to ask for a
first payment toward his tuition.

“’hat I fail to see Is why
you Should regard this deposit
as a “financial penalty," or
suggest that it "w ould make it
more difficult financially for
all students to attend college,"
or imply that the State institu—
ions should not be interested
in assuring that applicants for
whom spaces are being reserve
ed will actually show up to
claim these spaces.

I hope the Register which is
so i0T\\'Zu£l“ulOOking on all edu-
cational questions, will help the
colleges of Iowa by supporting
the advance deposit (or both
private and public institutions,

Yours sincerely,
Howard K. Bowel-l

To the Editor:

Grinncll is a Congregational
college. When i applied to Grin-
college. Wchn I applied to Grin—
nell, however, one of tho things
that attracted mo was the as-
sertion that Grinnell was non-
sectarian, and that they cncoun
age the applications of non-
Christian students.

I must admit, though, that
I was somewhat surprised, and
offended, to ﬁnd that at every
dinner the Trinity is enumers
ated during thc grace. This, to
me. evinces a lack of concern
‘for the non-Christian student
who is forced—if he has any
religious convictions at all—to
remain uncomiortably reticent.
it is unfortunate at on ever
ning meal—ostensibly a non-
sectarian functionrth a t th e
word “Lord" or something
comparable, would not suffice
instead of an allusion to a slice l
ciﬁc religion.

If, on the other hand.
impossible not to tovego the
mentioning of the Trinity, thc
assertion that Grinnell is a non—
scctarian school should bc abol.
lshed as spurious and deceptive.
