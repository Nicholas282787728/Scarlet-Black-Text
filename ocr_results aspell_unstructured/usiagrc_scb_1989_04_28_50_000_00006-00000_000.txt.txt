Faculty shocked by
revelations of past lives

by Shirley MacLaine

Last week’s symposium con-
ccming reincarnation, “Our Bod-
ies, Our Former Bodies," pror
duccd some startling develop-
ments around campus.

“It‘s been an incredible shock,
feelings of both disbelief and ex-
citement," said politicalrsciencc
professor Keith Fitzgerald after
learning he was film star Porky
Pig in a past life. “Of course my
friends’ kids love it. It kind of
explains my stuttering. It also
explains those odd dreams of get-
ting hit and shot at.”

Hollywood legend Pig, who
starred in countless Warner
Brothers classics alongside such
notables as Bugs Bunny and
Elmer Fudd, died May 6, 1956,
from a massive drug overdose.
Pig’s career went into decline afr
ter an offstage feud with Daffy
Duck in which he hit the famous
fowl right in the kisser. He bcr
came friendly with a faster-paced
crowd: Wile E. Coyote.
Yosemite Sam ,and The Joker.
Before his untimely death, Pig
had just begun work as an archri-
val to Superman.

Other members of the faculty
also tried to deal with their new-
found pasts. Tensions continued
to rise this week in the French
department as professors Jan
Bcrkowitz and Victor Vcrrettc
beth maintained they were Joan
of Arc. The classics department
is hoping Grinnell's ratings will
rise since the professors found

they were all originally partici-
pants in the symposium described
by Plato. Professor Gerald
Lalondc, formerly comic play-
wright Aristophanes. said that a
re-enactmcnt of the symposium
would be sponsored by the
Rosenfleld program.

In other departments, eco-
nomics professor Paul Munyon
was surprised to learn he was a
bloodhound, and history professor
Al Jones was a radical in the
French Revolution who was
quickly guillotined by his own
family.

Red' 3 manager Rose linked
to bets on Pioneer baseball

by Bob Woodward

The accusations have finally
been proven. There is substantial
evidence that links Cincinnati
Reds manager Pete Rose to an
organized gambling ring.

An unidentified source from
the Grinnell Police Department
in Grinnell, lowa, has uncovered
what authorities nationwide have
been seeking for months on end.
Rose 5 Signature (verified by a
handwriting specialist) was dis~
covered on two betting sheets
authorities in Grinnell claimed,
which show beyond a reasonable
doubt that baseball's all-time
loading hitter gambled on several
Grinncll College baseball games.

Rose apparently had a
connection within the Midwest
Athletic Conference who provided
him with inside information on
all the teams. The gambling rc-
ceipts indicate that Rose bct over
$10,000gat one Lime even using
as collateral the jock strap he
wore when he broke Ty Cobb’s
record40n each of the Pioneers
last two ball games.

Realizing that the cat was fir
nally out of the bag for good,
Rose went public to plead his
guilt. “I really thought (the two
games) were sure bets," he said.
“I mean both C08 and Cornell
looked more impressive on pa
per.” As it turned out, Rose

moment. A blanket insult to
female readers everywhere. Have
a baby you don't want and “Mike
Kent" pays all medical expenses,
gets you tutoring if you miss
classes due to pregnancy, helps
you conceal Lhe pregnancy from
friends and loved ones, and ar-
ranges adoption. All this PLUS
$500 can be yours if you deliver
the child for adoption. But what
about curtain number three?)

' Feb. 3, 1989: “Mike Kent"
Tackles God. (We figured it
would be a natural product from a
freshman in his first philosophy
course.)

It wasn't until after we had
written a few columns that we
became aware that there actually
was a freshman on campus whose
name was Mike Kent. We called
him and apologized profusely.
We said we would write an ex-
planation and print a retraction of
all preVlous columns in our next
issue. Bringing the hatred of the
campus upon “Mike Kent" was
okay when he was purely fic-
tional, but no living person der

wasn’t as proficient at laying bets
as he was at slapping singles,
since Grinnell won both contests.

Baseball experts are still due

bious that this evidence, however
compelling, will tarnish Rose’s
chances of making the Hall of
Fame. Don't bet on it.

 

 

 

served responsibility for all of
those columns. But when we
talked to Mike, the real Mike, a
surprising thing happened. He
said he didn't mind. In fact, he
said he was kind of enjoying the
attention, and he wanted us to
continue.

We didn’t know what to do.
The “Kent" columns were great
c0py. made people angry, and
elicited lots of letters. In short,
they did everything we wanted
them to. Involving a living,
breathing, human being, though,
took the charade beyond the
bounds of even our consciences.
It just wasn’tethical We decided
to pull the column, and we told
Mike, the real Mike, of our deci-
slon.

Then something Slmngc hap
pened. We started to get calls
from some people who know
Mike. Professors took us aside
to talk with us after class. We
even got a letter from Mike’s
mom. All of these people said
the same thing: Don’t do it.
They said that before we started
the column, Mike was a little

nobody, very insecure and unsure
of himself. He felt ignored and
unnoticed. He spent a lot of time
alone in his room. But since we
started the column, he had smed
to blossom He was gaining
confidence His grades were imr
proving People knew who he
was. His doctor said Lhat he had
never seen Mike so well. For the
first time in his life, Mike had a
girlfriend.

This really put us in a bind.
What we were doing was wrong.
Morally, indefensibly wrong.
But to stop the column might
destroy a person whose life was
just beginning to take shape.
Was that any better?

‘ When “Mike Kent" was ﬁctiv
lions, he couldn‘t be hurt There
was safety in that. But now he
has become a person. To stop
the column would cause deﬁnite
harm to that person. We decided
to continue.

So what has happened to
Mike, the real Mike, and why are
we stopping this now? The real
Mike Kent, at his very soul, has
always been insecure and unsure
of his place in this world. I don't
know why we thought that we
could change that by continuing
with the column, but we did.
Mike, unsure of his own identity.
has assumed the one we created
for the “Mike Kent" of our Colr
umn. Now, he is just as alien-
ated as he was before, but for far
different reasons. We stop the
columns now so we don’t do any
more harm, and, as we said bcr
fore, because we think the joke
has run its course.

Our sincere apologies to Matt
Macho, Beth Wodzinski, and all
the other readers who so faith»
fully wrote irate letters to our
fictitlous columnist. And, of
course, our sincere apologies to
Mike. The real Mike. In a way,
it would have bwn best if we had
left nature untouched.
