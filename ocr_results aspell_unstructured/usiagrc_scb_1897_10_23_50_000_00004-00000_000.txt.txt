Football.

It seems that the old Grinnell footr
ball spirit has returned. That spirit
which has so often carried the Scarlet
and Black to victory and made de-
feat not inglorions; that spirit to
which the old “grads” are wont to
point with pride and which we feared
had departed from us.

The team’s play at Minneapolis
demonstrated the tact clearly that
light men can play a creditable game
and even in defeat merit the appaluse
of all lovers of true sport. ‘he team
played with a dash and recklessness
that was very encouraging to the
management, and we hope the spirit
will be shown in the remaining
games. Practice the past week has
been very good on the whole but not
nearly what it should he. The inter—
ference runs slowly and the forniav
tions are raggedivery ragged at
times. Some of the varsity men in
their blocking seem rather timid, or
perhaps it is kirId-heartedness. They
run high and slow and it is a corn-
mon occurrence to see scrub end men
break up plays and tackle the runner,
while trickles from behind are fre-
quent. lnjnries received in the Mine
neapolis and Carlton games may ac»
count for a portion of this laxrty, but
only for a portion.

Norris has been unable to play
most of the week on account of in-
juries received and Fellows likewise
has been laid up. Wheeler, Capron
and Taft have also been inconveni-
enced somewhat but we hope their
injuries will not be lastingr and that
they will be able to play in the Ames
game a week from today.

Wheeler’s work at center this year
has been very good on the whole.
More experience in games will steady
him down and he will no doubt be-
fore the season closes rank well up
among Grinnell’s centers.
somewhat unsteady in getting the
ball back, especially on punts and his
defensive game is a triﬂe open. These
tarrlts will be remedied this week.

Capron's play at guard is really en-
couraging in most respects. He sizes

'l'att plays a hard, conscientious
game. He is rather weak in inter

juries will not allow him to play. His

Bur-d punts well and blocks well
but goes into the litre standing
straight up. He has a cool head and
can be depended on in an emergency.

Rule tackles low and hard, but does I

not follow his interference closely
enough. He is a fair punter.

Bert Gray plays a stronger deterr-
sive game than he has ever put up
before. His greatest fault is leaving
his interference too quickly.

Of the substitutes we will
more at length another time.

There are two or three general
points which should be mentioned
and which we hope may prove of
value to the men.

The team as a whole take every
opportunity to shirk practice. They
arrive on the ﬁeld late every evening
and instead of wearing their football
clothes to class do not dress until af-
ter 4:15. They fail to put snap into
