Would you approve ct Grilmell col-

Polly Phi-her: All students would
be stimulated toward more interest
in their work.

.loliii Eisoii: The Chicago plan perr‘
mits intensive study, which is not\
possible under the present system. It
would be an especially good idea for
Grinnell now that it has summer
school.

Roberta vinico: 1 think it would be
a good idea because it would do away
with all possibility of working for
grades.

Carol Gawtlirop: The success of a
small college depends upon cooperari
tion. The Chicago plan stresses in-
dividualism.

Dale Moody: I would like it despite
the fact that it has a tendency to .
weed out the average student. which
is not Grinuell's democratic idea.
Donald Fessler: Gﬁnnell’s summer
session permits a continuous year-
round term. which would be a great
advantage if the plan were to be
adopted. The concentrated study
would be worthwhile. .

Eleanor Manli: I don't like it for
Crinnell. It would do away with the
unity of the small college.
