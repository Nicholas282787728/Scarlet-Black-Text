Dave Dunlop took the game’s
individual scoring honors by
firing 20 points through the
hoop lor a 38% scoring average.

Game Summary

The Pioneers drew first blood,
jumping pit to a quick six point
lead, only to have the count
quickly knotted. Through the
rest of the first half North Cen»
tral maintained a slight edge,
closing the second period wrth
a 26-24 lead, North Central
came loack at the half to take
a very commanding lead and
hold it until close to the end or
the third quarter when Dave
Dunlop got hot, hitting for 15
of his 20 points. Grinnell then
drew to within one point with
five minutes remaining, but that
was all as North Central poured
on the steam to close out the
contest with a 12 point margin.

' Unbalanced Scoring

Along With Dunlup's twenty
points Freyder_ and Toomey
collected ten apiece to account
for 40 of the Pioneers 4'1 mark-
ers. In all, the team hit for only
28% oi its shots. Considering
that every man played at least
five minutes >and had scoring
chances, then the team's inahi —
ity to distribute appreciably its
scoring attack over more than
three men becomes glaringly ap-
parent.

Erratic passing which saw the
Scarlet and Black lose the hall
25 times is another factor which
played a part in the defeat.
