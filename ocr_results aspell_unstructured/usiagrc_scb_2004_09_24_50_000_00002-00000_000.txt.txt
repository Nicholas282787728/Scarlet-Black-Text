Norris practice space
replacing Musik Haus to be
available in October

Since Musik Hails became International Gnurr
met House at the beginning orthc fall semester, mm.
pits bands rind rock musicians have lacked a practice
space.

1128 East Street housed student musicians for
tour years; when the Housing committee chose the
application of International Gourmet Hoilse, “the
need [Or a space was clear," said Brendan Baker ‘06,
SGA’s Concerts Chair.

John ChaVL ‘05, chair ofotutlcnt mil ns tugar
, ron Treesnund, said that there are an unusually
large number or ﬁl‘s .us interested in joining the
group, Brtkei and Cl su std that the intro ed
interest in \‘Ultlelll music makes the need {or p . Ll:
space more essential.

Chavez approached Toni Crady, viccriiicsidcnt
t’ersrudenr serr res, aheur the need tor music prac ice
space. Chavez and Crady cllcniiuillv settled on a large
room in Norris Pit which was used as a music practice
Space from the 19605 to the 19805 and is covered in
grafﬁti.

Chavez hopes to have the practice space up and
running by early October, but Fi'eesound is still {6‘
solving the logistics of managing the space, Freesound
is still trying to find a secure storage space for instrur
ments and sound equipment as well as a system of
practice time scheduling.

Baker acknowledges that there are still a lot of
questions to be answered about the practice space.
“we’ve got the space," he said. “What now?"
