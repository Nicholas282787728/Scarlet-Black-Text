Double trouble: siblings go to Grinnell

Many studcnts ﬁnd that collcgc nrrers n ehnnee to eseipe
the fltmillcs that they have grown to love, hate oi feel some
combIIIntion thereof. Siblings in parliculm ﬁnd that the desire
to cultivate different personalities leads to attending different
colleges. For at least 19 sets of Grinnell sibr
lings, however, the allure of Grinnell trim-
sccnds and often improves anysour relation-
ship.

ling draws the pair to the school. Sarah
Lucmow '09 inditated that she wanted her
younger sister, Ann Luetzow ’11, to take a
look at Grinnell. “I wanted Arm to come to
Gtinnell,"sald Sarah,"l was trying to he unbiased and net pct-
suasivctl tried to be as neutral as possible."

Piige Greenley’09 and Dodge Gleenlcy ’11. known as the
“Great Grinnell Gteenleys," hadn’t consrdercd attending the
snme school until Dodge bcgan his college senreh and found
he held similar academic interests. “I wasn’t

Likewise, for twins Dylan.GuInIn"11
and Derek Gumm ’11,Grinnel.l was never meant to be a shared
space. Derek applied and was neeeptetl under Early Dccision,
whereas Dylan 1 -r began looking more closely ‘it Grinnell

to me, and she's been really supportive."

“I hated that I missed seeing a lot of his plays [in high
sehool]. but now 1 can go see his lmpmv. nnd that’s really run.”
Paige said, noung that even comcidentally living in Haines [0*

gether has not been a problem.

Ann suggests that the decision to go to
school with Sarah has not been without its
drawbacks, “It made me feel very claustror
phehie,l think, at ﬁrst,"she sniel. “I think it
doesn’t bother me that much anymore. But
it's just kind ot‘strange.”

Sarah mentioned hearing about her siss
ter from friends as one beneﬁt. “It's very
convenient," said Sarah, “because I’ll henr
about what Ann is doing even ifl’m not around her."

For the Gumms, the potential claustrophobia has yet to
take its toll: “I've heard stories about Derek," said Dylan, “but
norrnnlly 1 gloss 1 heat nhoutwhnt Detek does from Derek.”

The brothers say that, while some aspects ofgoing to school
together are less than desirable (their tennis
eoneh calls them “the Guinni twins"), they
do not feel socially limited or constrained

“You alieady have a friend here when you
come to school so you begin milkmg other
friends more quickly," Dylan suggested

In ruer,l>.r ges enlyt-ornplnintwus thnt it
was “a little weird coming back from abroad
and people that I hadn’t rnet heroie would
say ‘Oh, you're Dodge's sister; when i want
itbrolttl so he would avoid being ‘Paigc's
brother.”

Ultimately, the nttirutles of the three sets otslhhngs were
ones oteprnnisrn. Ann said that she believes “things will coir
tinue to iniprovemenveen her and Sarah.

Dylan also cited the changing nature or his relationship
with Dcrck' “l Feel like we're hotter friends now and not just
hrorhers.'l‘he I'Clationslup is just evolving."
