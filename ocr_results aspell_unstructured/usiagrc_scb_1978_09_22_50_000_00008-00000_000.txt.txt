Traditionally Indian powwows
have been religions in nature: each
dance expressed a symbolic
meaning.

Last Labor Day weekend, the
Mesquakie Indians of Tania, Iowa.
periormed a modern version of this
traditional ceremony. About 600
Mesquakie live on a 3,740-acl‘e
settlement only lltl miles from
Gi‘innell. The Indians own the land,

THE MI '(lll: KIE perform -a
pow—wow every year. but for the
tlrst time they hosted an inter-
tl‘ibal event last Labor Day The
tribes represented at this powwow
were the Red Earth tMt‘squaklet.
WolI River tlrom Wisconsin),
Ironwood tRosebud Sioux from
South Dakota), Sniokeytown (from
Wisconsin), and Cumberland
(Chippewa Indians).

The event was a chance for the
. Indians to mingle with members of
other tribes and to promote what is
called “Pan-Indianisnl,"

POWVWOWS ARE THE most
accessible oI the Mesquakie
cultural activities. The pow-wow is
a time for these Indians to gather
together to dance. sing. talk, and,
according to some. affirm their
tribal identity. Additional reasons
for the ceremonies are to show off
dancing skills and elaborate
costuming, as well as to attract

 

AT THE BEGINNING oi .the
afternoon all the dancers entered
the arena in a "grand entry." It
was a striking sight to seethe
assortment ol brightly colored
costumes, all moving about In a
mass in the center of the arena.
The mole dancers, many clothed in
|ull leather licadresses, led the
parade. They were tollowed by the
women and children. Before the
compet on began, an Indian gave
an invocation in the hiesquakic
language

Although the dances were cater
gcrized in several ways, it was
difficult for the unaccustomed
observer to (tlsllngulsh among
them. The most noticeable dif-

their bodies, uhile the women
tended to hop around, keeping their

movement.

_were additionally divided into age
and sex groups Several times
during the afternoon the emcee
called out “interrtribal,” which
meant that all the dancers were
supposed to dance together non-

dances were interspersed with the
competitive dances throughout the
afternoon. As the dancers come

arena scoring the performances.

have traditional meaning, but their
symbolic meanings are not wellr

The

and creativity

The men's “fancy” category
provided the most exciting dances
of the day. The object OI these fast
moving dances was to anticipate
the tinal beat of the song so that
one could prepare to land on one’s
knee precisely as the last drum
beat sounded. This proved to be
very challenging. and several
people disqualified themselves by
lallding too soon.

Historically the Mesquakie have
held local powwows since their

arrival in Iowa. According to auth~

Viewed Dy wnites as early as lit/H.
As the years passed the Indians
included non-religious events in the
festivities, such as horse racing, in
order to attract white tourists.
They lound that the money spent
by the white onlookers provided a
boost to their economy. However.
the ceremony still remained
religious in nature

THE HISTORY 01" the set-
'tlement in Tama begins in [$42
when the Mesquakie, known then
as the Fox, were heavily in debt to
traders. Whites were gradually
settling on their land, and the
government wanted lhe’lndians to
relocate. By 13% the FOX had
moved to Kansas~a barren
terrain which was qmte different
Irom their hilly. forested home In
Iowa.

During 1354 the Fox attacked the
Kiowa. Commanche. Cheyenne.
and Arapaho Indians, causing
many casualties. Fearing that the
government would not look kindly
upon this bold display, the Fox
began to sneak back into Iowa
They were able to sell their ponies
and raise enough money to begin
buying land. The Mesquakie's
initial purchase was 80 acres near
Tama.

ii\' itisti Till-2 Iowa legislature
passed a law appl'ovlng the Fox
tribe's Iowa residency. The In-
ilians were then considered
responsible to the federal govern-
ment and to the local authorities.
To tulfill an earlier treaty
Congress started to pay annuities
to the Indians in 1867. This involved
a considerable sum, which the Fox

used to buy more land. By 1894 they ' '
had 2,800 acres, and since then the

tribe has gradually acquired more
land.

Jonathan Andelson, Grinnell
anthropology prolessor. wrote this

description of the settlement
today: “As one drives through the
rolling, wooded region, one sees
homes located at random along the
winding road, but set back from it
20 to 200 feet Each house is con-
nected to the road by a drive, and
at various

single story. The small clearings
around each house are for the most
part unlandscaped. Usually a car
or pickup was visible along with
several outbuildings.

“The land presented a quiet and
lovely face this day, The woods
rose around you on every side, and
the virtual absence oi primed
farmland suggests that this world
ditfers trom the one you have just
lett."

POWvWOWS OCCUR only On
special occasions. One is

Yet the best part of the experience
is the discovery of a nearby
community of Indians who enjoy
celebrating and sharing their
native ways.
