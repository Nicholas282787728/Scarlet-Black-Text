SCARLET AND BLACK

March 3, 1989

Soviet students react to
Des Moines Register article

To the editor:

It seems as if we arrived
yesterday, but the calendar says
no. it is already nearly a month
since. tired but happy, we arrived
in Grinncll. Time to sum up the
first impressions. We are
impresscd by the size of
American cars; Europeans prefer
smaller ones. We admire the
choice of goods in shops and
efficiency of all those in the
consumer services. We enjoy the
absence of queues (excepting
those at the dining ball, but that
really does not count). After the
hustle and bustle of Leningrad, a
mcgalopolis. it seems very quiet
and peaceful here. and we like so
much the squirrels on the campus
who pay no more attention to
people than Russian sparrows It
was not easy to adapt to the
Grinnellian style of studying
because back in Russia,
humanities are taught mainly
through oral exams. We are im—
pressed by the casual way
computers are used here, though
Lhcre is too liILlc time for us to
master the technique Living on
the campus is fun but unusual for
us, At home in the Soviet
Union, the college administration
would be surprised to have people

coming from the town where the
collegc is situated living on
campus. Accommodations in
Soviet dorms are usually limited,
and the administration is only too
happy to have as few people there
as possible. Textbooks are
borrowed from the library, not
purchased. Anyway, most of
them are not on sale. Food at the
dining hall is also good by our
standards.

Perhaps the first really
unpleasant surprise for us came
when wc read the covcrage of our
interview to the reporter of the
Des Moirtcs Register, Linda
Lantor. We could hardly believe
our eyes. We can‘t have said it.
we didn't. 0n coming here we
wcrc sure that lhc lcnn “cold war"
was a historical one. but here it
was, in the title of the item. We
found phrases and words taken
out of context and describing
something we do not feel at all.
The reporter has taught us a
lesson: we are not to be too
careless while dealing with the
modiai something we read about
in the Soviet press, and have now
come across here. Since our
arrival we have seen nothing but
hospitality. Everybody has been

most friendly towards us,
professors. roommates, Iowans
downtown. We keep receiving
lots of invitations to various
families and are asked many
questions which show that people
are really interested in what is
happening in Lhc Soviet Union.

We are certainly different in
many respects, have different
cultural traditions, beliefs, and
values, but different does not
mean worse or better. It is
simply our way of life, and now
it‘s the time to look for what is
common in our lives rather Lhan
fordiffcrcnces.

Linda Lantor is not right;
Grinncll does not seem cold to
us. We have found people who
are ready to help us whenever
necessary, who are really
interested in establishing good
relations with our counLry. and
we appreciate it. At the moment
it is our home, and coming back
from our Lrips to different places
in Iowa we already sigh with
pleasure: it‘s Grinncll, we’re
home.

Grinnell seems to us cozy,
quiet and friendly.

Strause criticizes Dentel's
"firing" and SGA restructuring

To Lhc editor.

Regardless of who won the
election, SGA and the student
body is faced with evaluating the
failed restructuring of the
entertainment program. Last
spring the powers that be in SGA
pushed through a proposal that
drastically altered the entertainr
mcnt program at Grinncll.
Someone oncc said, “If it ain‘t
broke don’t fix it," yet in the
bureaucratic struggle that is SGA
this idea somehow took a back
seat to a warped idea disguised as
progress. In their decision to
book and run their own activities
SGA ousted Georgia Dentcl. who
has worked for the college and
with SGA for some 25 years, In
that time she had helped establish
a film and concert program that
has been heralded on a national
level, including four write-ups in

Billboard magazine. Just to
scratch the surface. in the last
three years Ms. Dcntcl has

booked. with the cooperation of
SGA. Soul Asylum, Alex
Chilton, the Violent chmcs,
the Modern Jazz Quartet. Mojo
Nixon, Chick Corea with Allan
Holdsworth, the chlaccmcnts.
and the Fleshlones, among
countless others. Take a look a
little further down the line and
you will see that Ms. Dcntcl
booked a list among whose
highlights include Louis
Armstrong. Little Feat, Duke
Ellington, the Police, BB, King,
Pat Mcthany, Jefferson Airplane,
Jolln Princ, Dizzy Gillcpsie. Joan
Armatrading, the Steve Miller
Band, and, of course, Bruce
Springsteen. It is just this kind
of entertainment that the college
consistently promises in its
attempts to attract students to thc
coml'lclds.

Ms. Dcntel was “fired” from
SGA and replaced by Steve
Bialek and social coordinator

THE TASTIEST PART
OF THE GRINNELL
EXPERIENCE .

PEPPERC‘ (DIP/V 15'

Dave Sleinman. neither having
any experience in the art of
booking a concert. Tile rationale
for this shift, acco ing to Viccv
President Rob Killion, was so
that films and concerts could be
booked “in a more producLivc and
cheaper way." As a result of the
shift Mr. Killion claims that
SGA has “been able to bring
more films and concerts to
campus." Obviously something
went wrong during the vital shift
of thcory to practice, Last
semester SGA put on eight
conccrts. During the fall
Scmcstcr 1987, under Ms.
Dcntel's direction, SGA presented
nine concerts. Much of the
emphasis of the new program is
placed on quantity, which clearly
it failed to deliver in its promised
proportions. Through Ms.
Dcntcl's direction both quality
and quantity were consistently
achieved, Clearly if we are to
compare these two fall programs
the l987 program shines.
Among the nationally known
acts brought to campus included
Mojo Nixon and Koko Taylor (a
double bill), Soul Asylum, Alex
Chilton, Scruffy the Cat, and
George Russell. This fall the
only relatively well-known acts
were the village idiot Emo
Phillips, Timhuk 3, and Chick
Corea (a repeat from two years
