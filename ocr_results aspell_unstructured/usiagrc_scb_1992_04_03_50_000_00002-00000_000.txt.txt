Stained Images portrays Views on
Christianity in Video format

By India Weston

Christian stereotypes werethe sub-
ject of the video Stained Images,
which was shown just before Spring
Break. In the video, Christianity, a
subject of great debate for over 2,000
years, became the focal point of both
negative and positive responses from
a mixture of participants. The video
began with people giving their inter-
pretations on true Christianity.

Sminedlmager went on to take up
different stereotypes by showing, for
instance, a hand coming out of a tele-
vision set and taking the viewers’
money. There was also a picture of a

man shoving a Bible down the throat
of another, and still another of people
leaving their brains outside the door
when going into church.

The concept of faith, for many,
was associated with money and scan
dal, although one man in the video
stated that the problem results from
human beings and not Christ One
woman saw God “as a male chauvin-
ist“ and questioned the goodness of
God,

The stereotyping became more
personal for firm believing Christians
as the video progressed. Participants
shared their felings of Christians as

beliefs on others. Christianity was
also believed tobe a very“confining”
religion. MostpeoplebelievedChris-
tians “dress[ed] very conservatively,“
that there was no smoking or drink-
ing, and that Christians were “up-
tight” and “exclusive."

There were a few people, how
ever, who shed some positive light.
These persons felt that there were
Christians who were genuinely inter-
ested in listening to the beliefs of By India Weston

attack them; not all are judgemental, RN Connie GOShOm ViSile the

member group into more and more
lengthy exercises which aided in eas»
ing themind. Afterthe two-and-ahalf

they felt. Bodies were relaxed. Minds
were calm, Everyone felt good, and
even ready to retire for the evening.

Processing, an imponant aspect of
the techniques forGoshom, involved
relating the experiences one felt after
an exercise. Participants shared their
feelings with the group, or with a
partner. Goshom would then give a
description of the specific exercise as

people. The workshop, although en-
titled Visualization, also focused on
taking care of one’s self and taking
