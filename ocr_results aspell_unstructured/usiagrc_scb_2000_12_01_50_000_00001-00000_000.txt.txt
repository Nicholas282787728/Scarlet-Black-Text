Joint Board and the Election Board considers how
to Count ballots in the Student Initiatives vote

by B.J. Bloom
Staff Writer

Just as low voter turnout and n con.
rusingeleetion process wiih no precedent
have hampered and delayed the outcome
orthc presidential election nationwide, a
low voter turnout and confusion over an
election process with no precedent hate
hampered snd deltyed the results ortlte
student initiatives here.

Ben Morgan ‘01, administrative co-
olrlinator of SGA, has ruled with the
Election Board in determining that not
enough votes were out for any ortlie ink
tintivcs to get the 50 percent ortlie coir
lcge population necessary for the election
to be considered valid, But this is where
irgets tricky. 646ballotscistourof129l
current on-cam—
pusstudents gave
a ballot turnout
of half a ballot
over the 50 pct.
cent mark in to-
ml population.
The Election
Board. however.
did not go by oil/err ms! but by urea cast
for each speciﬁc initiative. That means
that irsomeone voted for or against one
initiativc zlnd did not mark a vote either
way for another initiative. the initiative
not voted on would not be considered
by the Election Board toward the 50%
required tor a valid election.

Thls means that the initiative for a
green audit and a reassessment of the
environmental goals orthe Master Plan
Fell about 15 votes short. with the other
initiatives falling about30»40vores short
or the 50 percent required for the clecr
tion to be valid.

Morgan emphasirrss that the Election
Board wanted to consider each initiative
separately rather than lump them all to»
gather "Rather than count the ballots
turned in, we counted the votes as: for
each initiative. if you were to simply
count the number of ballots, someone
could vote for one or two oftlie initia»
tivos and give consent to the other initia.
tives. \V: felt that our way oreounting
the votes accounted more for the true feel-
ings orthe voter."

A number or students, particularly
thosewho wrote the initiatives, were up

 

"Election Board’s decision

was unprecedented, unad»

vertised and illogical."
—Rachel Melis ’01

setwith the election procedures followed
by Election Board. Rachel Melis ‘01, Paul
Ford ‘02. Kare Wolf ‘01, and Mike
Shapiro ‘0 l, riled a formal grievance with
Election board, calling for a reassessment
of the election process. They real that
the Board's interpretation orthc bylaws
goes against precedent and that this sysr
rein of counting was not advertised, so
the voters and rhc writers of the initia
tivu were not informed about the way
their votes were going to be counted.
They tclt this was particularly confusing
because voters were not allowed to ab.
stain from voting by leaving part ortlic
ballot bln As Melts puts it, “Election
Board’s decision was unprecedented. one
advertised, and illogical."

Election Board
met on Monday to
discuss the grieve
ancc. They upheld
their initial deci»
sion, ﬁnding that.
while there has not
been precedence
for this system of
counting votes. the by-laws do not we
ciﬁully state the vote-counting proce—
dure. Thus, Election board is allowed to
interpret the by-litws in rhc manner they
sce fit and can set precedent irthey wish
to do so.

Melts appealed to Joint Board and
moved to overturn Election Board: do
cislon. Sheunderstands Election Board’s
concern with the by-laws and with set.
ting precedent. but she reels that they
need to work on changing the bylaws
before they change anything else about
the initiative process. As she says, “Else
tion board, at the very least, made a mis
take in interpreting the by.laws. The
votes were counted in a way against the
intention or the voter."

This sparked a heated discussion at
Joint Board. Morgan presented his view
on the issue and the discussions Election
Board had both before the election and
in hearing the grievance. He also cm»
phasimd the point that the initiative pro.
ccss was much dinerent {tom the elec.
tion ptoecss for president and vicerprni-
dent, which he feels the people who riled

Old-growth protest

Grinnellians participate in an action against Staples ofﬁce
supply store with students from accross the Iowa

By Laura Polstein
Staff Writer
On Nov. 15Y ﬁfteen Grinnell students traveled to
the staples omoe supply store in Cedar Rapids to prise
test as part ora national day or action organized by
Rainrorost Action Networlt. They were joined by two
students from Univcrsity oflom 2nd one student from
Kirkwood Community College, Six of these students

'locked down in front of the store in order to, Mollie

Hayward ‘04, said, “letstaplcs
know they can't ignore us any
longer."

Tliegoal ortheprotcstwas
to pressure Staples to phase out
all wood and paper products
made From old growth ﬁber,
or ﬁber that oomcs from us
public lands. In addition, the
studcno would hits to see the
store make available paper
which is 100 percent post-00n-
sumer recycled and set a target orso percent posteconr
suincr content for all paper produce. Another demand
is the immediate phaseout ofall products that are made
from 100 petecnt Virgin wood ﬁber.

Pulp mills in the us consume more than 12.000
square miles or forcst every year. and that damage Gin»
not be attributed singularly tn staples. However. staples
is the largest supply store in the country, with moo
stores in the us and morc abroad, This, according to
Hayward, makes it “our means orbcingablc to choose
what we buy."

As sntah KogeltSmuckcr ‘01, points out, we cut.

rendy do not have ability to make an environmentally
susmmzblc choice when we buy paper. Another criti.
cism orstrplcs that the coastal Rainrorost coalition
makcs is that they sell dale and other wood ptoducu
made by Sauder industries, a company that purchascs
wood coming directly from the Great bear Rainrorest,
the largest intact temperate taintotosr in North America.
The activists, according to Kogchsmuclcor, atedemand.
ing mat staples stop this behavior and "become a re.
sponsible corpomtc citizen."

When oldgrowth wood is
logged, we “lose biodiversity and
entire ecosystems," say both Hay»
ward and Kogehstniiclsct The al-
ternatives to using such wood are
not beyond the means or a
superstore like staples, Last year,
Home ocpor was targeted for the
same issue and no longer uses wood
from oldgrowth forests. That ram»
paign was well supported at
Grinnell, but the next step, says Kogclomuclscr, is to
pressure our own administration to stop purchasing
paper made from oldrgmwth pulp.

The Nov. 15 protest has already yielded some re»
stilts, staples now requlrcs its managers to distribute in-
formation that informs customers which paper prod.
ticrs are made trom recycled paper. This is an important
ﬁrst step, and it dcmonsrrnrcs that the store got the stu.
dents' message.

Meanwhile, the activists are gearing up at coastal
Rainrorcst Coalition planning session this Thursday.
