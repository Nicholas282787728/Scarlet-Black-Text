just that at the Midwest Conterence

Of course there is often a big scor»

top these teams in the conterence as
well.

Coach Obermiller is giiardedly
optimistic as befits the coach of the
favorite, indicating that “it will take
a balanced team performance that
Includes Several Individual titles and
a lot of other placers” to win the
title

The best chances tor Grinneil
points come fromsteve Ward, Mike

the 400 medley, should also pick up
some big points.

CLOSE SHAVE FOR WRESTLERS

by Sigi M. orteubach

Last week Grinnell's wrestling
team ended their season. For the
first meet of the week the battling
Pioneers journeyed to Oskaloosa to
do battle with the men from William
Penn, The Conservative William
Penn coach forced our hirsute grap-
plers to shave their Whiskers (it is
in the rule book), As one wrestler
said after the meet, “That's where
our Strength went. it was In the
moustaches,”

Even without moustaches, the Grins
nell learn did fairly well, The Wile
liam Penn meet established a precee
dent tor this season, They actually
forfeited more matches than we did.
As a matter ofiact, Rick Nightingale
won on a forfeit, his most success»

lul college match since the tirst meet
at the season Then came our two
newcomers, Butch Gates and Arnie
peters, and both were greeted by a
first period pin, Arnie got pinned in
a record time oi 21 seconds; at least
he didn’t wear himself out. Next
Bob Donelan showed his tinesse and
agility, squeezing out a 5 to 4 vice
tory, Even though his opponent was
powertul, Donelan controlled him
throughout the match Then lohn
Pursell was conironted by an overly
muscular iarm boy, who pinned
John in the second period.

Next our old pro, Washington Ale
ston, took the mat against a much
meeker opponent. Wash took him
down and almost pinned him, but it
seemed as though wash was so tired

that he had to settle for an 11 t0 4
decision. Finally, our intrepid
heavy-weight, Light Lee, ambled
into the ring. He was confronted bya
huge, strapping mammoth named
Boo. Personally, i would have run
away, but Light Lee stayed on the
mat of uattie. True to his name, BOO
picked up Lee and quickly mashed
his back to the mat This abruptly
ended the meet with William Penn
Victorious, 24 to 12.

Last weekend the Grinnell wrest-
lers voyaged to the limit meet oi
the season, the Midwest Conference
meet. No one came home with any
medals; as a matter of tact, no one
even won a single match. This pro
vided an embarrassing finale to an
ignominious season.

Rumor had it that Kip Korir oiCoe
had transierred and would not be
around in Midwest Conterence track
this year, much to the reliet oi the
rest or the Conference’s quarter-
milers, 220 men, and triple iumpers.
Korir’s perrormance in these
events at the outdoor conterence
meet last year were incredible He
did just as well against Grinnoll
this week, and a bunch oi surprised
runners swore that they would never
believe another rumor, Korir led
Coe to a lilteen point victory with
scorching legs on their mile and 880
relay teams and a win in the triple
lump.

or course, there were a tow tine
pleasant surprises tor Coe, too.
Ttie anchor leg or the distance mede
ley, for instance. Coe’s miler took
the baton with a comlortabie torty
yard lead (sound familiar7) and ran
his best time or the season, a very
creditable 4:32. The time was good,
good enough tor second place. Chuck
(The Machine) McGrath brought the
Grinnell baton home with a 4,19 mile
tor the win You have to leel a little
sympathy for the Coe runner, it’s a
real bummer, running a 4:32 mile on
the way to a loss.

The Grinneli distance men asserted
themselves again in the twoemile
with a one, two, three iinish. Paul
Miller broke the tape with Chuck
close behind, and Dan Hildebrand
running third. Jon Gray scored the
only other successes on the track
with a double victory in the high and
low hurdles tor yet another week,

B-Ballers lose
Games, Burnett

by Curt Gorrell

It might have been better if the
varsity basketball team had missed
their bus, and with it last weekend’s
road trip to Minnesota. As it was,
the Pioneers dropped two games
over the weekend, a 63-52 loss to
Carleton and a 109781 rout inflicted
by St. Olaf. The latter Contest has
left Gt‘innell with the praspect of
concluding its season without the
aid of senior center Bob Burnett,
Who was injured at lhe Olaf tIlt,

The game hosted at Carleton Frie
day night was slow paced, and the
Pioneers lacked their offensive
spark so prevalent in other recent
matches. Bob Burnett led Grinnell
with 23 points, but only Dennis MOSS
of all remaining team members
could contribute points In double
tigures (12),

Regarding the St, Olal contest,
students should perhaps be glad
simply to see that the team got back
alive, tor this duel was reported to
have been a real bloodbalh. Burnett
was forced out with a knee injury
suffered only three minutes into the
game, which, according to Jeff Jens
sen, was waged with an extreme de—
gree oi physical contact that “went
unchecked by the referees.” Jen-
sen’s l5 points and 16 by Dennis
MOSS led for Grinnell, but Dial had
largely tucked away a victory by
halftime, leading them 56 - 25

Currently slated with a 4712 record
in conference play, and 5713 overall,
the Pioneers will close out their
season with a game against Coe
tonight and Belmt tomorrow.

oil his times in both the barrier
races since the beginning oi the sea-
son, and he looks primed and ready
tor the indoor Conterence Meet this
week

There was the usual Grinnell
strength in the field events. The most
blatant manifestation of held muscle
was Barry Hufi's 49’7" toss of the
shot, a throw that overshadowed the
next best put by three feet. Dave
Wright was unhappy with his second
place short in the triple jump, but
he took soliCO in his win over Korir
in the long jump At least somebody
managed to beat Korir. Chris Mad»
son iinally hit his stride in the vault,
clearing 13' to win the event by a
twoeioot margin

This week is the indoor Conlerence
Meet The meet is primarily a test
or sprint strength and team depth
which means that it tests the weakest
parts of this year's team. Boosts
trom the held event men and distance
runners will bolster the team
scoring and make the diiterence...
we hope. Norris Stubbs, where are
you now that we need you?

Police, Drake
Stop Skaters

by Jeff Dick

Grinnell's very young, very inexe
perienced, but “very game” hockey
team was beaten easily by an exper-
ienced Drake University team last
Friday night in Des Moines’ lce
Arena by the score at 17-3.

The final score doesn’t take into
account the great time that all thus?
Grinnellians who either participated
in or attended the game had belore,
during, and especially after the
game.

On the way to the game the rally
wagon that was carrying eleven peo-
ple was stopped by the State Police.
The tail lights weren’t working so
we were sidetracked to get them
fixed before we continued to Des
Moines After paying 25; tor a new
fuse which blew again 10 miles down
the road, We headed for the ice
Arena. We got there during the
lhii‘d period Of the Oak Leafs game,
took the ice alter the game, and
skated on a regulation sized rink tor
the first time all year (and we didn't
miss Barber Plaza at all). Drake
took the ice and prepared themselves
for the final game of their season,

The game included three 15 minute
periods and Griuneil got on to a fast
but misleading start, Mitch Erickson
scored for Grinnell With Ltn assist
by John Onstad, and Grinnell took an
early, but shortelived ieo lead,

Drake proceeded to score six goals
In the remainder of the first period,
live in the second period, and the
score was 1171 when the two teams
left the ice for a 15 minute rest in
their locker rooms. Our Grinnell
team decided that the goal would be
to score twice and try to hold Drake
to three goals during the final period,

It almost worked. Grinneli did
score their two, but tired at the end,
as Drake scored a total of Six for a
1773 final score. Grinnell's goals
were scored by Jim Pirolli and Dave
Flnten on line individual efforts.
Jeff Dick assisted on both goals, Af-
ter the game, arrangements were
made to schedule tour or live games
tor next year and possibly one more
tor this year,

Upon arriving home from Des
Moines the team got together in
Lailgztn Lounge (the home of Alpha
Sigma Sigma) and had a great party
"celebrating our defeat or some
thing

All in all, it was great fun and
everyone is tired up tor doing it
again.
