7 Ou’r Of This World

The Honor System was voted out of existence
yesterday. Only 75% of the student body cast bal-
lots, in what seems to us one of the most impor-
tant polls considered during any school year. We
feel that the loss of the Honor System is a detri-
ment not only to the students now enrolled in
Grinnell college, but to all the students who will
come to Grinnell in future years. It is unfortunate
that a larger percentage of the student body could
not see the inherent values of the Honor System,
and the far-reaching importance of this crucial
vote.

Even more distressing, however, is the charac-
teristic attitude of the student body indicated by
its reaction to this one situation. On subjects of
international and national importance, as well as
significant campus issues, there is an indifference
which is appalling. The fact that we are college
students, living in a sheltered environment, gives
us no right to ignore developments in the external
world, ,

It would be fitting for us—the “hope of the
future”7to cultivate an active, intelligent interest
in this world in which we live.

Le‘l’rers To
The *Edil‘or

This letter concerns the new
rules recently laid down with re-
gard to the prepping of women,
and, What is more important, the
State of Women's Self-Government
at Grinnell.

We were told, without any ex-
planation, that this year it had
ben decided to limit and discon-
tinue a major part of prepping.
Has it been so unpleasant in the
past that this sudden change is
necessary? It seems to us that
past criticism by the ireshinen
is not that there has been to
much prepping, but that the

is merely a figure of speech. Ac-
tually, freshmen look forward t.
it, and prepping serves is def-

linite purpose on campus. It not

only promotes unity in the ﬁreﬂy
man class but the upperclass wo--
men a chance to know the preps,
Isn't it better to draw the wo—
men together through prepping

than to let the familiar fresh-
inan resentment of aloof and in-
diffeient upperclassmen cause ill-
eeling in the Quad?

However, the fundamental point
is 7 who made this decision. Self-
government to us means that the
women who are concerned in this
matter should be given an op-
portunity to express themselves.
On the contrary, we were not
given the chance to discuss or
, o vote, even though the League
Board pleaded with the adminis-
traucn to have its ideas of prep-
ping enforced. The changes /were

In 1892, 10 years after the Purge, 35 years af-
ter Hawkins Noble Experiment, and 46 years after
the founding of Grinncll, Herkimer Hawkins 11,
now a wealthy coffee bean tycoon, returned for
homecoming. With him came two suitcases of
coffee beans, the bacchanal continued for three
days At the end of that time, Hcrkimer Hawkins
Il signed a check for three gymnasiums, a swun-
ming pool, and a Morris chair for the presidents
office, In a formal ceremony the following winter,
coffee was served for the first time in Grinncll
dining rooms. (Women, of course, only were allow-
ed one cu , .

We hinge that, as in the past, students will
approach the dining rooms with misty—eyed rever-
ence, dedicating themselves to the perpetuation of
a fine old Grinnell tradition which must not be
allowed to perish. our forefathers were courageous.

In 1857, 11 years after the founding of Grin»
nell, one Herkimcr Hawkins purchased a handful
of peculiar black beans from a traveling medicine
show under the impression that the beans were
of a beneficial nature; guaranteed to remove warts,
cure the blind staggers, and form the base for ﬂ.
tenacious and rather sticky library paste. Upon
immersion in hot water, the beans did not melt
as advertised; instead, the water turned an inky
black. Herkimer, humiliated by the failure of iris
experiment, grabbed up the jug and drained it at
a single guly. That he did not die immediately is
evident, for we have on the campus today the
greatrgreatrgrandaugﬁlter of Herklmel‘ Hawkins.

In 1882, 25 years after Hawkins' Noble Exper-
iment and 36 years after the founding of Grinnell,

the administration attempted to stamp out coffee
drinking in the dormitory system. Ye Olde Drink-
ing Rule prohibited the brewing, or chewing, of
coffee beans. ”Blind pigs" were opened immediate-
ly in the town of Grinnell, and these clandestine
drinking spots were patronized by students. Four-

Siudeni Owners

Not all students, nor all veter-
ans on campus, are entitled to
keep automobiles, Dean Karl
Dearborn announced this week,
in a statement intended to clari-
fy the new car rule.

"There are three factors which
prompted the college to relax its
heretofore stringent vehicle rule,"
Dearborn said. “First, married
veterans and their families must
be considered as requiring trans-
portation. Second, there will be
a small number of veterans ens
titled to new autos under the
government regulations concern-
ing amputees. And third, in
lview of the two rules preceding,
it was considered advisable as a
courtesy to studentsnow owning
cars, to let them ride in campus
registered autos.”

“It is to be‘emphdsizsd," Dean‘

made, and we were expected to
abide by them.

This letter has nothing to do
with they men's decision regard<
ing prepping. We respect their
tight to govern themselves and
know that they would grant us
the same privilege.

Speaking for the women stu—
dents on the campus who believe
in self—government, we ask that
it be a reality at Grinnell, not
just a phrase in the catalogue.
