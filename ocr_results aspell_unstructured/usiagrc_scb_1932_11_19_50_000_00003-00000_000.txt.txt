Well, at last the homecomers are
gone and so is a great deal of under-
classmen’s clothing. If not satisfied
homecomers, just return them and
we'll refund yours.

Waldo cnilds. last year's athletic
big—shot, in memory of the good old
days when Cottage Ill used to send
his laundry over to him filled with
step—ins and other interesting exhioits
started his homecoming off right by
picking up the suitcase of none other
than the chairman of the democratic
committee of Iowa. "Everything to
gain and nothing to lose," declared
Waldo.

Roommates, Plan

Homecoming, with its reunions of
the old grads, proved the means of
unexpectedly bringing togeth two
former Grinnell students who last
year, as sophomores, roomed to-
gether, and who again shared the
same room for two nights.

Robert Waite, of Wntcrloo. and
William Wallace, ot Exeter, Nebras-
ka. have had careers which have in-
terlocked rather strangely for the
past year or two, and which promise
to continue to do so.

Sluu'eii Suite

Entering Grinncll two years ago,
with the class of 1934, both were
plamd in Clark hall. Last year they
decided to room together, and shared
a douhle on the third floor of that
building,

This year. Waite and Wallace, in
company with numerous others found

themsclvcs unahle to continue in col-
‘lrge ,tor the time being, at least, and
,ludepondently of each other, planned‘
to work this year.
Both Bunlmrs

Each secured a job working for,
his father, and, since both of their
fathers are honlrers, it to: ed out
that their employment for this year‘
is exactly the same. At homecoming,
each found himself unable to resist
lthe temptation to come hack to Grin.
nell for a, few days, and they ar-
rived here at almost the same time.
The result was an unexpected rem-is
ion, and the two secured their old
double for the two nights which they
would spend here.

Their friendship is not yet ended,
by any means, for hcth expect to at-
tend Northwestern next year, and

stem Illinois school.
