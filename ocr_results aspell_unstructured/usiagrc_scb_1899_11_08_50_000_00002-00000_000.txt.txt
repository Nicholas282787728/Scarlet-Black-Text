THERE erL be a mass meeting
Friday at4:15to arouseenthusiasm
tor Saturday’s game. Lct every
one turn out for this meeting, pre
pared to enter into the spirit of it.
We must have a large crowd ot
rooters at the game Saturday.
Those who attended the last Grins
nell-Iowa game in Iowa City, will
remember the good work done by
the routers that day. We must
do even better this time. Root-
ing plays no inconsideraole part
in winning a game, as any meme
ber of the team will testify. The
meeting will be an interesting one
on account of the number of alum-
ni who will be present. No stu-
dent of Iowa College can excuse
himselt tor remaining away.

__r..—

NEXT SATURDAY afternoon the
Grinnell ioothall team will play
their hardest game ot the season.
It will be the deciding game for
the state championship. It has
been several years since any one
game could be said to decide the
championship deﬁnitely, as this
one will. Iowa's record this year
is well known. Their goal line
has notbeen crossed, and Chicago
University alone has scored on
them. With this record behind
them, and the state championship
ahead of them, they will play the
hardest kind of football of which
they are capable. Add to this
an enthusiastic and united student
body to cheer them on and it can
easily be seen what we have be
fore us, We cannot offset theii
record, but we can go down and
cheerour boys on, Every student
who can possibly leave town Sate

' cheering for Grinneil.

urday should be on the side lines
The team
deserves it and needs it. The
fact that the Ames game came on
Friday prevented any ot the stu»
dents trom accompanying' the
team, but there will be nothing to
prevent, and everything to urge,
each one’s attendance on Sature
day, and let everyone go prepared
to cheer. We can be assured of
a cordial welcome trom the Iowa
City students. The Ames sttlr
dents have only ivdids of highest
praise for their treatment while in
Iowa City. Let us meet this
treatment halt way and in the
right spirit, and so conduct our-
selves that, no matter what may
he the result of the game, there
may be nothing but good ieeliug
between Iowa City alld Grinnell.

Y. W, C. A. Notes.

Instead ot the regular Y. w. C.
A. prayer meeting we will hcar
reports from the delegates who
attended the state convention at
Des Moines. This promises to be
a very interesting meeting and no
girl should miss it.

Mr. Rose, state Y. M. C. A. sec»
retary, will address the women of
the institution this evening at
6:30 in the college chapel.

It is time to renew your sub-
scription to the Evangel. It
would greatly accommodate Miss
Miller ityou hand your name to
her rather than have her be com
pelled to visit you. We would
urge the new girls especially to
earnestly consider the matter o(
subscribing [or this paper. it
comes once a month at 50 cents
per year. and is iull otY. w.c. A.
intormation, and no girl, whether
active or associate, should be
without it.

The Sunday Mission study
class will meet at llalfrpast four
hereatter, instead of ﬁve, because

oi the changed hour of evening

service.
