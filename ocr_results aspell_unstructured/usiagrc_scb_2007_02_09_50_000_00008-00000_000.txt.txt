Senior severs connections, rediscovers Grinn'ell

I managed to leave my cell phoric at a friend's house near
Chicago a few weekends ago. As a result, the first week ofmy
last semester of college reminded me in many ways of my first
few winters at Grinnell, I'll admit I'm not one ofthe militantly
antircell phone upperclassmen. I’ve
scrirried out of the library to take a
call more times than I can r'cnicrnr
ber, but my recent, involuntary cell
phone abstincnce proved surpris
ingly enjoyable. .
I remember living in Read my
first year, having my fi‘iends' exten-
sion number-s memorized. or not actually memoiized: I had
to write them in a list on the wall and for two years I asked
my roommate Jenny for thc number every time I wanted to
check the messages. Now that I live off campus, I can rattle
it off— 4319, without having to think, but that’s just how it
goes. I remember the kind of detailed planning that came
naturally, when we relied on email, and the simple chance of
catching people in their rooms. It was strangely comforting to
know on Monday your- dinner plans forwednesday Obviously
Grinnellians still make plans with each other, but I know I use
the “I’ll just call you!" approach a lot more often these days.

Also, though I do adoic my family and friends from home,
it was exciting to be fully submerged in Grinnell again, totally
unrethcred to the outside world Sophomore year-,1 remember
shivering on the thirdtfioor lire escape outside Loose. listening
to my mother and a great deal ofstatr
ic during our weekend family phone
call. During the week it would sit
pathetically in a corner on my desk,
one single, sad bar of cell coverage
_., . rising and falling aivay along the left

’ side ofthe screen. This past week, as

my phone made its way back to Iowa,

I was unreachable except via email Even then, the choice was

mine as to whether- I'd actually lit My social sphere cont

tractetl pleasantly for a week, Grinncll almost entirely cclipsing
gossip from Menomomc, Minnesota and everywhere clsc.

Most importantly though, during that week, I began to rot
all take in my surroundings. It may sound strange, brrt l was
p. irig attention in a wayI hadn’t for a long time. Living off
campus, I ofrcn make calls en route our of some desire to be
productivc or to inultirtask, wanting to get in touch with people
while I commutc. Forced by my own torgcrfulness to pirt the
phone down for a week, I crossed Park Street on the way to

rehearsal and realized that I get to live here, in a David Ken-
ncdy' 05 photograph for one morc semester, Skip my column
if you're turned off by this kind of unabashed sentimentality,
but lcavrng the bookstore after the startrofrscmestcr snowfall,
I stepped out onto central campus and gapcd at our pristine,
quiet campus. The snow was thick and tray, reflective and
anmatied all the way to the old Forum. Iciclcs dripped from
the awkward backside ofcarncgie and the gargoyles wore tiny
hats ofsiiow. I felt a little surge of that first-yearwoiider and a
little bit or that senior impulse, to freeze in place and remember
all ofit,jiist like this. In the moment, I didn’t realize that soon
we would all have the opportunity to freeze, literally, as the
Midwestern winter kicked into high gear But I did realize that
I have only a few brrsy months left to crnoy this strange, very
good place.

In the end,thouglr my exercise in tlrsconnectcdrress was both
informative and enjoyable, it couldn’t last forever. I checked my
mailbox every day. l was glad to see my phone again when it
arrived: an old, non—ﬂipping model, with its strange, ﬂashing,-
red, green and yellow lights. It's good to have it back- because
this isn’t my first year, it’s my last one, because I put my cell
number on my resume, and because fabulous post-grad plans
can't materialize completely on their own.

Last Friday, the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC), created by the
U.N., relcased its fourth report on global
warming since 1990, stating that global warm-
ing rs in fact a real problem. and there is greater
than a 90% chance, based on data collected,
thathumans are the main cause ofrisirig global
temperatures since the 1950s. Most of us here
at Grinnell on our early February walks to class
are probably thinking of the old joke: “How
can global warming exist ifit's so cold outside?”
But this lPCC report is no laughing matter.

The report, which has been approved by
122 countries, including the United States,
says that global temperatures will continue to
rise for centuries to come.This rise in temper
atures (3.5 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit if carbon
dioxide levels reach twice that of 1750, before
the industrial revolution) will lead to chang—
ing weather patterns and rising sea levels, and
those will lead to things that we here at the
SEiB do not want to even think about.

It should be brought up that this rise in
global temperatures rs just that: a rise in the
overall temperature of the world. It is an ave
crage. The rise will not be 3.5 to 8 degrees
everywhere. some places it will be more, and
some it will be less, Unfortunately, the great-
est rise in temperar
tures wrll he in ,. - t
the Arctic, meltr
ing icecaps, raising
the sea levels and
offsetting weather _ ,
parrcrns through-
out the world (to
see climate maps
of this change, as
well as news analy
sis of the IPCC report, see the Feb. 3 New
Ym'k Timer article "Science Panel Calls Global
warming unequivocal”) So, even though
we here in Grinnell, IA, might not be exper
rrcncing a great increase in temperature, that
does not mean we are not being affected by
global warming. The increase in temperature
in the Arctic, or even in New Mexico, offsets
the whole global climate, affecting everyone
around the world.

Yet within the global context of this is»
sue, there are still those who do not see the

aim-”issuers;

urgency of changing humanity's behavior iii
relation to the environment. Therc are many
scientists. as well as politicians.who claim rhar
global warming is not as big ofan issue as the
“alarmist"5crcntrsts make it out to be. Senator
James Inhofe (R—OK) released a document
in reaction to the
IPCC report called
“Corruption of sci-
ence" which says
the report is much
too political, One of
the major critics of
the global warming
movement is Rith
ard Lindzen, an ate
rnospheric physicist
and professor of meteorology at MIT. He
has written articles defending his and other
scientists’ position that global warming is not
caused by humans and that there isno raced to
change our patterns of behavior.

Lindzen and others of all political stripes
have argued that the study of global warmr
ing is too political. In an April 2006 editor
rial in the Wall Sim! fawn/ll, Lindzen said:
“Scientists who dissent from the alarmisin [of
global warming] have seen their grant funds
disappear, their work derided, and themselves

libelcd as industry stooges, scientific hacks or
worse,"eriIe we may disagree with Lindzen’s
stance on climate change, we agree that the
politicalization of science is a major problem.
If global warming research turns into politir
cally charged research, then the data collected
will be illegitimate, Onersided science is not
science. Even though this new IPCC report
gives strong evidence to support the human
causality ofthe problem,we still need educate
ed people to question these findings. Science
is about the search for truth and that search is
nevertendiiigThcre always needs to be some»
one to question the findings, to question the
authority.

But what do we do? What can we do?
Does the cliche “I’m only one person, what can
I do?” hold true? No. In the and, change will
begin with individuals. And what better place
to do that than on a college campus! Learn
about the complexities of the problem. Learn
about how rndusrry, government and individu—
als can act. Then decide how you want to act.
You can do nothing. You drop out of college
and chain yourself to an iceberg. or you can
do something inrbetween the two extremes
like sending a letter to your elected officials or
turning off the lights when you leave the room,
Either way, the choice is yours.

Where the hell is Grinnell? Who the hell knows?

To many ofus, coming to Grinnell was like ﬁnding a long-
sought after haven. The occasional uneventful weekend note
withstanding,Grinnell provides an casygorng environment with
manyopportunitics for enjoymcrrt,bc it through learning,partyr
ing or simply hanging out with great people. However, Grrnnell
has been changing very rapidly, to a
point where it is becoming almost
unrecognizable. Since I first arrived
five semesters ago, I've noticed that
many of Grinnell’s must prominent
and well-advertised qualities are
disappearing: we are becoming ecor
nomically more exclusive, culturally
less diverse, and overall less unique, given the ongoing efforts
to follow in the footsteps orour peers. In summation, Grinnell
is becoming less Grinnellian,as we raise tuition and give up di-
versity, both economic and cultural, in an effort to appear more
“desirable.” The argument behind the tuition hike is that a
higher tuition will signal higher quality, making Grinncll more
desirable and ultimately increasing enrollment. Ifthis confuses
you, you’re not alone: this non sequitur is stumping everyone

but the trustees, who are convinced that increasing tuition wrll -

improve the quality of the applicants.

The Office of Admission has a website displaying state-
ments about why “students in the class of2010 chose Grinnell."
I read through these and, curiously enough, none of the stu-
dents said they came here because of Crinncll's increasing
tuition. Diversity, serious academics and great people, on the

orher hand, were commonplace responses. I hope I'm not the
only person reading these testimonials.

Recruiting richer snidents is not inherently wrong. How
ever. we should think long and hard before we do so at the ex-
pense ofcqually or more capable, but poorer studimts.Thc col-
lege is known for, and should also
maintain, high lcvcls ofeconomic
and ethnic diversity. Thats port
ofwhat makes Grinnell Grinnell.
It's why I decided to apply here in
the first place.

Starting today and into the
weekend. the trustees will vote
on the 12.6% “market adjustment," around $4,200, as well as
a separate “modest trritiorr increase.” One argument often used
to justify the tuition inciease is that Grrrinell has higher costs.
How that's happening, I don’t know. one would expect costs of
operation in Iowa to be lower than, say, Pennsylvania or Mast
sachlisetts. one fact I do know is that, as of 2005, the paid
amiiiistrators that sit on the Board ofTrustecs had among the
highest per capita salaries ofall our peer institutions.

Regardless {the arguments, it’s safe to say that in the long
run, the strategic plan is reshaping strident demographics at
Giinnell, drawing a wealthier student base that is less reliant
on aid and therefore able to pay most, if not all. of the com-
prehensive fee. The difference between the more traditional
Grinnell classes and the upcoming ‘triistiiietl’Giinnell classcs
will break continuity, so that for quite a few years, alumni will

sec in Grinnell a student body they could n‘ever imagine being
a part ofThc effect on international student presence has been
clear: with the class of 2008. 52 international students joined
the Grinnell community, With the classes of 2009 and 2010,
only 31 joined in each.

This basic discontent surfaces in the low levels of alumni
donation. Perhaps the trustees need a more accurate system for
gauging student and alumni sentiment. In fact. a few minutcs
of casual conversation with phori-a=thon smdents wrll rcvcal
why many alumni are so adamantly refusing to donate. Why?
It could be diversity or it could be other things. Either way, it
can’t be a coincidence that both students and alumni are not too
happy with the trustees,

And ﬁnally, even if the strategy works and a higher tuition
signals better quality to prospective students, are those the
students Grriinell really wants? Judging a school by its tuition
does not exactly indicate a form of genius, especially given the
availability or so many other real and more accurate forms of
evaluation. A prospective student who would dismiss Grrrincll
from among his or her choices based on a relatively low tuition
is perhaps best left out ofcrinneu, Grinnellians are intelligent,
hardworking and committed to academicsThey come here to
learn, not to show off how much they will pay for college. To
forget this would insult those who value this college and this
community for its eharaetcr and not for its price.
