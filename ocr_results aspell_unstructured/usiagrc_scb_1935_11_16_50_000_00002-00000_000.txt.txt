wrlo'Is T0 BLAME?

Feeling that student spirit at
football games has been lacking
has been shared by both alumni
and students during the cur
rent season. The underlying
cause of this has not been iso»
lated although it is obvious that
there must be a reason. This
reason apparently should lie in
the cheer leaders, the pep com-
mittee or the student body.
Perhaps all are to blame. 0n
closer analysis, however, per-
haps the fault lies with none of
these.

Earlier in the season the
cheer leaders received criticism
in these columns, but we feel
that their work has improved,
and the blame lies less with
them than it at first appeared.

Allowing for the fact that
apathy in the student body
should be blamed on those re»
sponsihle for arousing pep, at-
tention naturally falls on the
pep committee, 0n the surface
it appears that they are to
blame, but closer observation
reveals that the hands of the
pep committee are tied, and
thus the real fault is isolated in
the adndnistration.

The pep committee attempt-
ed to hold pep meetings prior
to the last two games, but were
unable to make arrangements
because of lectures planned by
the administration ‘The result
was that the football team went
into its last two games without
the student body being given
an opportunity to hold a mass
pep meeting. With all due re-
spect to the lecturers ’who have
been scheduled instead of the
pep meetings, we don’t feel
that attendance has justified
excluding pep meetings from
the program. ,

Even the pep meetings which
have been held have not been a
success due to the fact that it
has been impossible for the pep
committee to provide proper
advance publicity. Under a new
ruling it is impossible for the
yell leaders to put the students
through a series of vocal exer-
cises in the dining rooms, or
even to make announcements
of the pep meetings in the
men’s dining room,

We feel that there is no bet-
ter method of securing a turn,—

 

out at pep functions than lead-
ing yells in the dining rooms,
where practically the entire
student body is present. Thus,
for the sake of dignity, nthusi.
asm and spirit are sacri 'ced.
Thus, although the cheer
leaders and pep committee are
perhaps not entirely without
blame, and the student body is
certainly not without a meas-
ure of blame, the basic trouble
lies in authorities above any of
these groups in the actual plan-
ning of school activities.

Other Opinions 1

.PASSIVISM vs. PACIFISM
(The Cornellian).

Sincc everyone is agreed that.
peace is ultimately desirable and
should be preserved if possible, the
schism in modern thinking seems
to be over ways of preserving peace
and modes of action when it is
broken. Antagonists of paciflsm
declare that policy to be one of
passive indifference andin the event
of war, a slothful inaction while
homes and lives are endangered or
pillaged. They contend that such
passivism invites destruction.

They are quite right. And cer
tain pacifist beliefs can he criti-
cized on this basis when under-
stood only in their negative as-
pects; for instance, the belief; that
another world conﬂict will destroy
the present civilization; that no in-
temational differences Should be
settled by arms; and that our coun-
try should not be defended by arms

even in the unlikely event of in»‘

vasion.

The positive factors have been
neglected entirely in such an ‘evalu-
ntlon. These are: peace propa-
ganda , and peace education in
schools based on the knowledge
that war is an impemianent end
too—costly phase of clvllizatlon; re—
duction of armaments at least to
the limits of defense weapons or
less: national neutrality and ac»
tive work to promote international

peace.
Struggle, competltlon .. “war"
cannot ever be abolished. nut
peace from armed conflict it is pos.
Sible to obtain and to preserve in-
violsble. Such peace is not gblng
to just happen 7 it must be
“fought" for. A willingness to
struggle for this peace dis-
tinguishes the pacifist from the
passivist.

HE PLAYED FOR HIS TEAM
(The Collegian)

The world awoke last week to
find another highly individual char-
acter no longer in its midst. Billy
Sunday was an Iowa product, born
in Amcs. Possessed of a strongly
emotional character. he played the
church's game as strenuously as
baseball.

Many have condemned the dy-
llamic little man and his forcible
utterances on the ground of insin—
ccrlty and affectcdness, Yet a man
who can feel the strength of his
convictions as Sunday did is a
worthwhile asset. Too many peo-
ple attempt to gracefully straddle
the fence on almost every question
and this attitude cvcn carries over
to the policies of nations,

Sunday was a great man in his
own Way because in combination
with intellect he also had a dy-
namic strength of his convictions.
He played the gamc and played it
so that his side as well as the other
team knew exactly where he stood.

Sydney Howard, next to Eugene
,O'Nelll, is classed by many critics
as thc most prolific and popular
American playwright. Some of his
most successful plays include;
“They Know What They Wanted,"
(Pulitzer prize play), “ch Mc-
Cobb’s Daughter," "The Late Chris~
tophcr Bean,” "Yellow Jack,” and
"Paths of Glory." which he recently
adapted from Humphrey Cobb’s
book of the same name.

The production of "Pinafore"
has been definitely postponed be-
cause it was impossible to Secure
a men's Chorus. The drama depart-
ment will present "The Silver
Cord” on the original date set for
"Plnsfore." This action was taken
by the dramatic council yesterday
afternoon.

some remnants of local dialect.
The fact that the worst forms of
dialect, as well as correct English.
are used on the radio, will prevent
the adoption of a universal dialect.
she said.

"Some people have been work-
ing as long as 20 years to put out
this dictionary," Dr. Martin stat-
ed, and she herself has been work
ing on the staff for five years. A
new edition will be put out only
when changes in the language de~
mnnd it, she said, Technical terms,
words adopted from foreign lun-
guages, and a few slang terms
which become standard usage
make the language a . growing
tblng.

Final Authority

Specialists in every field who
work on definitions for the diction~
my are the final authority in case
of a doubtful word, The specialists
chosen are always So eminent in
their fields that their colleagues
will be willing to accept their judg-
ments, As for the illustrations, one
man has charge of the entire task
and trains other artists to use a
uniform technique, resulting in the
small black and white sketches
which illustrate the text.

Asked whether the staff mem»
bers did not find the dictionary
bulky and heavy to work with, she
replied, “on, no, we all became ac-
complished hodrcal‘rlers after a
while." In unconscious proof of her
statement, she Carried away on her
head the Copy which she had been
using to illustrate her statements

Pesc‘heret Talks
on Etchings

Exhibits Work to Women
At Quadrangle

Lcon R Pcscberct, now livmg in
New London, 1a,, exhibited and ex-
plained the process and subject
matter of his colored and black
and white etchings in the quadrail~
glc drawing room yesterday after-
noon at the first ted sponsored by
the women's social budget commit»
tee this year.

In his talk, Mr. Pesoheret
brought out the fact that he is the
only person in the United States
who does colored etchings. In or-
der to receive instruction in this
particular field of art, he went to
Belgium where he studied under
an ctchcr for the Belgian court
Consequently, many of his etch.
ings are of subjects found in Bel—
gium, although some of his most
interesting plates portray Chicago
scenes,

Etching Processes

Mr. Pcsclieret explained the
complete processes of etching and
dry-pointing, and illustrated the
difference of the two by several
examples of each done in black ink
orl White paper. He feels that color
Work rcqulres a much greater
knowledge and skill, however, be-
cause it sometimes involves every
known method of workmanship,
such as “soft-ground," “aquotmt—
ing," and the “bitten line" as well
as "dry-pointing."

Colored inks are rubbed into the
copper plate upon which the com—
position is drawn with a steel
needle, which is then wiped and
printed on damp paper.

The important paint ls that the
etcher must know exactly what
the desired result is to be before
he starts his plate. Sometimes it
takes weeks of redrawing before
the copper plate can be etched,

The committee in charge of this
lecture and tea. includes Rita
Phelps, quadrangle social chair-
man, Marian Wood, Emmy Lou
Crouch and Adelln Woodward,
cottage social chairmen. The com—
mittees were assisted by Miss
Edith sternfeld of the art depart
ment.
