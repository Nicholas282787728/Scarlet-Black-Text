Creative Writers Band To oge ether

WIG Covers Bald Spot in Curriculum

By Bill Warburton

when Kendra Ford arrived at
Grinnell last fall she was in for a
disappointment, You see, she is a
creative writer.
"Grinnell didn’t have anything,"
she lamented.

 

She has apoint The outlets for
a creative writer are extremely
limited atGrinnell. The only courses
available [or someone who is inter
ested in developing his or her crea-
tive writing skills are a couple of
upper-level English seminars.
Where is the average person supr

posed to turn?

Well. there’s LheFreeharthrerr.
Ford explored that option. In fact.
she even became involved in the
puplication’sselecuon process. She
was not satisﬁed, though. She felt
that the size and quality of the sub-
missions were not as good as they

What about the GrinnellReview?
Ford had not given itmuch thought.
Butlhen again, the GrinnellRevt'ew
and mat“ reehand Pres: do notstrike
at the root of her problem. Submit-
ting to a publication, or selecting
for a publication has its limita-
tions. Ford was searching for an or
ganization that would promote and
improve creative writing skills.
When she did not find what she was
looking fore she started her own
group.

Along with Jason Elbogan, Ford
organized the Writers lnterestGroup
(WIG). Individuals who are inter-
ested in writing short stories or
poetry meet every Tuesday to read
their works and critique the works
of others. The group serves two
very important functions. Itserves
as a frequent fonim {or the exhibi-
tion of creative material, and it
provides creative writers with valu—

.able input and critique.

The response to W.I.G. has been
more than satisfactory. In fact, so
many people showed up for the first
meeting Ihat Ford and Elbogan
planned on splitting the group into
two ormore smaller groups in order
to promote a more' personal ex-
change among the members

The high level of interest in
W.IlGr is indicative of the Creative
writing Void at Grinnelll This
doesn’t mean that the Grinnell
College administration is indiffer-
ln facL a
committee for creative writing has
recently been established to foster
creative writing outleul But the
committee is very much in the
planning stages. Ford truly hopes
the administration is working hard
to effectchange, and to broaden the
opportunities {or the creative
writer.
