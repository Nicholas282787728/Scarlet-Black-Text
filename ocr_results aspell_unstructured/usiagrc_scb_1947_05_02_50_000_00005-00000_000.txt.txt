Pioneer Foilr Take Two Titles
At Drake Relays Competition

Exhibit Prowess
In 880 Ycl., Mile

The four Pioneer cindermen who
comprise both the sail-yard and
mile relay teams proved their
worth last week at the Drake
Relays, when they took firsts in
both these events in the Iowa
college division.

Relay men Bill Berry, Clark
freshman; Steve Hitchcock, Cowles
freshman; Bill Bouma, Dibble
freshman; and John Bonyata, a
freshman from town, loped ahead
of the field in the 880-yard clas-
sic, with a time of 1:302. and
fared equally as well in the mile
relay in a. 68.

Grinnell’s individual entries,
however, had a worse time of it.
Greg Nowell, Pioneer star hurdler
failed to place in the 120-yard
highs, when Harrison Wilard of
Badlwin-Wallace smashed the
Drake track record, in a time of
:14.1; and John Bonyata failed

. to qualify for entry in the loo-
yard dash.

Intramural League Play

The men's intramural softball
league gathered momentum this
week after a Slow opening week.
So far. it’s anybody’s race, and
competition is almost evenly di-
vided among the eight teams of‘
the league,

Saturday, Clark hall-s team:
took the measure of the Gates)
outfit and took an 8-3 decision.
Gates staged a comeback Tuesday
and ran over the faculty team to
the tune of 4-1. Wednesday saw
Smith take a close game from
nawson, 6-4, and Langan beat
Clark 4-1, Dibble outsluggeu
Smith for a 12-5 victory on
Thursday, while Rawson ramped
over Cowles unrnercifnlly for an
11-2 score. Dibble grabbed a post-
poned game wrth Clark Monday
by a 4-2 margin.

No team has shown itself to
be complete master of the league
thus far, but all have shown pos-
sibilities. It seems probable that
the championship will not be
settled until the last game has
been played.
