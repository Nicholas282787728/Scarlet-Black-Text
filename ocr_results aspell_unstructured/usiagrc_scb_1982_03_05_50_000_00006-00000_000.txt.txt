The Loose Hall Ball;

Rompin” and stompin’ in Darby Saturday

by Boscoe Rhemus

Yee-haw!

In case you haven't heard by now, lolks,
this Saturday they’re gonna be lettin' the
bull out of the chute for this spring's edi-
tion of ﬁle Loose Hall Ball. The theme is
the wild, wild west and it should be one hell
o[ a good time all the way down the line

Yea-haw!

Starting out the evening is one of our own
home grown bands, Eidos. Lead singer
Mark Bradshaw said he and his band will
play “classic rock — irom The Who to The
Stones to Steppenwolf. . . a good dance
hard rock band.” The main music is gonna
be provided by a wellrknown outfit called
Asleep at the wheel. They play some good
country swing and boogie tunes that‘ll
keep you Texas two-steppin' till uie cows
come home.

Yes-haw!

The band stars jamming at 10 pm. or
so, but you'll wanna be sure to get your
buns over to Darby by 8:30 pm ior Eidos
and 'cause that's when the cowboys are
gonna start tappin’ all them kegs oi
brewski. According to one of the party's
organizers, there are gonna be “twenty
fuckin' kegs, man,” so if we're planning on
finishing all that brew, we should start the
drinking early.

Yearhaw!

incidentally, it might have occurred tt,
you that Loose Hall doesn’t exactly exist,
so to speak, this year. Well hell, don‘t let
that bother you none! Gates and Smith are

gettin‘ together for it this year, and talks, .

they're gonna make sure that Saturday is
gonna be an evening to remember.

Yes-haw!

The urban cowboys are taking the hole in
the wall known as Darby and are gonna
shape it into some kind of crazed replica of
vintage Dodge City. The bar and barstools
are gonna be made out oi bales of hay, and
there’s even gonna be a jail (you have to do
shots of something to get outi and
everything!

Yee~haw!

Since the meme of the hash is the wild,
Wild west, folks should come to Darby
dressed for the part. You’ll be sure to see
lots of honky-tonk queens, cowboys, In»
dians and oil field trash. Dig out your
lcrpound belt buckles, tightri‘ittin' jeans,
boots and lo—gallon hats for this one, folks,

Yeerhawl

All in allI it should be one hell of a good
time. “Mamas, don't let your babies grow
up to be cowboys?" Bull! You just get that
notion right out of yer pretty little heads
this Saturday It’s gonna be a drunk and

ness’ more bizaar creations. He plays the
leader and mastermind of a nefarious
gang consisting of himself and (our friends
who plan to commit a robbery. Guinness
takes a room in the house of a cheerful old
lady (good fairy?) who, living purely in a
world of her own, buys the gangs mas—
querade as musicians and suspects not the
slightest bit oi wrongdoing, despite their
wicked plotting whenever her back is
turned. Eventually though, she discovers
what they've done and the comedy ascends
to fantastic proportions as they try to
cover up their deed. Note the appearance
of the young Peter Sellers and, interesting»
ly, of Herbert Lom, who later played the
police captain driven over the edge by
Sellers in the Pink Panther series.
