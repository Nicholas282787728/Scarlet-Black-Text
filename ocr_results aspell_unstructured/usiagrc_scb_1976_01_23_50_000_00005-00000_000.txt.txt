“Catherine the Great beginning
in 1763 recruited thousands oi
Germans to migrate irom the
hide River valleys to the wilds oi
the Volga below the city of Kazan.

She set aside vast iarmlands for
the Germans as a butter to bar
barous Tartans.~Los Angeles
Times

Our wile has a barbarous Tartan
that she simply adores.”

The tartans were a nomadic
group who resided in an area oi
Central Prussia known as “The
Plaidlands." Historical documents
indicate that these men of the cloth
were all kilt in a series of bloody
skirmishes, Catherine the Great is
known to have banished the Tar-
tans from Russia, with these now
immortal words: “Out, out,
damned Scot!” Even the most
clothes-minded historians, until
now, have skirted the important
question: What was the connection
between the Tartans and the famed
Pugachev outfit oi the same era?

belly for freedom

As we face two-hundred years,
d another presidential election,
. is necessary to return to the
conceptions oi 1776 to iind our
place in 1976. It is ior “We,” as the
people who revolted to establish
the dignity or human lreedom, to
rally to protect that tattered ﬂag
from the forces that seek to sub-
jugate all iree men to one power,
and bind that power to one state.
It is “We the People” that has
served in the past and will serve in
gt; iuture, despite recent
o isguidance, as the moral iorce of
‘3 nation and the whole world tor
the next two hundred years, it only
we subscribe to the precepts oi our
,geed.
We must remember that “We the
ople” is not the legacy oi one
nation, rather, it is the call to all
nations to live by. And it is a Call
that must be answered by those
who preserve its reality,
warranted not only to preserve its
meaning but to also preserve the
power oi the state which rests its
foundations on such a precarious
block.
We must remember that “We the
Pen le” never comes to serve
g r in order to increase justice,
0 in it lies the heart of tyranny;

rather “We” must serve justice
and thereby only increase power
when there is a challenge to
justice. For the cost oi ireedom is
great, it must never again be
measured by power and prestige, it
must be measured as it has always
been measured, in human blood.

We must always carry the
banner of human freedom and
individual worth with clean hands;
hands that would never he willing
to transplant the tree of liberty in
the fascist regimes found almost
everywhere, or in the racist
regimes which compromise all
human worth through distinctions
otrace,creed,or color. For in such
hypocrisy lies our ruin.

We are all blessed to live in the
New World. The mistakes of the
country are the mistakes oi youth,
ior two hundred years is a short
time in the quest for human
freedom. It is for this generation of
“We the People" to recommit
ourselves to the noble experiment
of this New World and to share its
promise with the whole world. And
if it is not for us to find universal
freedom in this centennial, then it
will be the next. For if there is a
value in human freedom, then all
governments must yield to its call.

Life is a bitter cup of tea

by Katherine A. Kramer
The iollowing are the lyrics
from the 1936 production of
‘Pins and Needles’ which was
originally produced by the
International Ludies'
Garment Workers' Union.
They remain amazingly
timely for graduating senior
women (and men).

When I was young, I studied
hard and thirsted after
knowledge

And often burned the mid-
night oil so I could get to
college.

They told me
education,

Would improve my situation.

my fine

So then I crammed and
crammed until I was almost
in a coma

And thesised and examed
until I got me a diploma.

Ah Ha, they said, now comes
admission

Into a very high position.

Out I went and looked around

And Macy's was the place I
found

I filled my blanks and ap—
plications

And went for my examination.

They took my weight and took
my height

And tapped my chest and
tested my sight

Examined my throat and
measured my hips

And even took prints of my
fingertips

émda

Then they tested my LQ.

And asked me what I'd like to
do

And when that exam was
through,

What there was to know,
Macy’s knew,

Having been involved with KDIC
ior nigh unto four years now, I feel
a bit of fondness for the ten watt
radio power of southeast central
Iowa. After all, where else is one
able to properly hear the rugs or
Ukelele Ike or (God forbid) the
soundtrack to “Jonathan
Livingston Seagull" (in its an
tirety)? And what better way for
insecure young college students to
soothe and assuage their sensitive
egos than by becoming an ‘air
personality’wther than by writing
newspaper columns, or doing both,
a discussion with which I shall not
.bother myseli.Thus, it pains me to
hear people speak ill of Kch—
particularly those who feel uiat it
does not properly fill its role as an
educational Station. Perhaps to
some, Haydn‘s Symphony number
You Name It is more ‘educational’
than, say, something good of John
Coltrane’s, but I fear that I cannot
be counted among that number.
Nor do I consider myself to be in
league with those who iind dreary
readings of Coleridge or Sandburg
or Minoy ‘educational.’ The
problem, therefore, is for KDIC to
find acceptable educational
programmingiradio shows which
interest as well as informiin order
to appease critics ofall stripes. Not
wishing to appear a hypocritical
slouch, I dug around over break
and discovered programming
which I feel to be of an excellent
educational nature. It is to be
hoped that at least one of these
stellar intellectual presentations
makes it on the air waves someday
somewhere.

historian Blanche A. Michelob. The
Iceberg War lasted from 1910 to
1915 and was caused by
unrestricted marauding icebergs
in the North Atlantic. The
culmination of the war occurred in
1912, when an unrestricted iceberg
attacked and sank the Titanic.
After this bold and brazen move,
the icebergs grouped and ate
tempted to move south, only to be
repelled by the Allied Gull Stream
late in 1914. Even so, according to
Michelob, Woodrow Wilson’s
failure to act early in the iceberg
War cost him credibility and
prestige with the Congress, and
eventually doomed his League of
Nations plan. Michelob and
Cronkite note one for»

Maurice Chevalier, in a per-
formance taped in 1969, brings his
distinctive dialect of French,
English, and Martian to a reading
ofT. S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land.”
This reading is understandable
only to certain members of the
Gumbee family in the Cajun
backlands of Louisiana. Next

salsa swing to selections from
James Joyce's Ulysses.

War,” studied by revisionist

Waldren. This week: Waldren

Lemon Jefferson. Rahsaan talks
about his unique abilities of
playing one guitar string in-
definitely and playing as many as
six strings at once, and the name
”Rahsaan," which means “reader
of Voltaire" and “friend of sheep.”
Rahsaan also perlorms “Vasec-
tomy Blues” and “Mississippi
John Hurt Was a Real Jackass.”
among others.

[could continue with more from
my plethora oi aural educational
delights, and may do so at a iuture
date. One must admit, though, that
the selections presented thus far
are certainly more interesting and
educational than SerbocCroatian
versions of Wagnerian operas
or Jerry Rubin talking
macrobiotics—or even the sound
track to “Jonathan Livingston
Seagull" (albeit not by much).
