Campus Opinion 7 “What do you
think of Saturday classes!

Clifford Ingram: "I think it would
he a good idea to follow the policy of
some other schools and have Monday
classes on Saturday. Then the stti~
dents could have a nice long rest over
the weekend."

011mb Rice: “I don't have any but I
think that they're all right. If you
don't have any. yoii sleep all day Sate
urday anyway."

Mr. Paul D. Knight: ‘I favor their
complete and entire abolition. I think
that everyone needs those last two
days for recreation."

Josephine Noel: ’I think that they-
're all right. but decidedly inconvenr
lent for anyone who wishes to go
home over the weekend."

Blayno McCurry. “Saturday classes
are a good thing, I think. In my
freshman year, Crinnell didn’t have
any Saturday classes and it made thc
Tuesday and Thursday three hour
schedule very inconvenient. I think
afternoon classes are worse than Sat-
urday classes." '

Miss Evelyn Boyd: “I approve en-
tirely of Saturday classes because
they relieve the Frlday schedule. I
would like it better, though. if there
could be two Saturday mornings in~
stead of une.”

Bill Crouch: "I think Saturday
classes are more beneficial than any
others because all knowledge of the
week culminates then. However, I
don’t have, and wouldn't have, any
Saturday classes."

Pauline Muller: “Saturday classes
are all right to keep from having his
ternoon classes, but they take all_thc
pleasure from the week-end. No fooir
in'."

Prof. H. S. Coitnrll: “I don’t see how
we could get along without them. I’ve
always had them, both as a student
and as a teachc "

Robert Tolliott: “I don’t have any.
but if I did I would give them as much
attention as any other class."

Lucile Mclllurmy “Saturday class-
es would be fine if the library were
open on Friday evenings.”

occasions, but was blocked from

From the standpoint of reception.
the performance or “Charley's Aunt",
produced last evening by the Exper-
imental Theatre, was a notable suc-
cess. The audience seemed thor-
ollgllly to enioy the play. and showed
their delight by frequent bursts of
laughter and vociferous applause.

The play itself, considered technic-
ally. is quite out of date. Tliereip
perhaps lies a great part of the charm
of the prcscnt production. Modern
tlieatreegocrs have long since learned
that asides and soliloduies are no
longer employed as methods of him
parting information. Realism in its
various ram cations has demanded a
more lifelike presentation of the ex—
position. and as a result these time-
worn and time-honored conventions
have been almost entirely discarded.
So it is with joy that play-goers see
such a revival of ancient customs as
was put on last night. ‘

Movement [5 Slow

As is usual with amateur stage pro-
ductions, the performance moved a
trifle slowly, especially in the third
act. This slowness was due in part.
at least, to the fact that some of the
players did not appear to know their
lines as well as might be desired. In
particular, the ladies all took great
care to speak slowly and expressive—
ly. What was lost in dragging out
-the words was.more than made up for
in the resulting clarity of speech. I
have no doubt that every one in the
audience got every word (unless, as
frequently happened, the dialogue was .
drowned out by laughterl..
