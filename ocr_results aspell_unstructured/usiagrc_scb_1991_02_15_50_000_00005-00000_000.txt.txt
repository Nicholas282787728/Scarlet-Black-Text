Grinnell Union debates Persian Gulf to a loud house

By Ju e Kaster

Audience responses, ranging
from flying paper SCUD missiles
and foot stomping to groans of
disgust and quiet applause force
shadowed the closeness ofthe final
tally ofthe Grinnell Union Debate
“This House Supports Operation
Desert Storm" last Sunday. The
motion failed its 102 people left
through the “Nay” door, 84 walked
out the “Yea" door, and 22 ab-
stained. Arguing in favor were
Erica Tarpey, David Karol, and
Jordan Maglll, and opposed were
Scott Wittstruek.Noah Zaring,and
Richard Clcrkin.

Unlike the Union’s first two der
bales, this debate was approached
in a generally serious tone by the
debaters and the whole atmosphere
was more tense. John Nickerson.
House Speaker for the debate, at-
trihuted the tension in the air to the
"high level ofcmotion" attached to
the issue of the current war. The
selection of logical and dramatic
rhetorical devices reﬂected the dice

_ baters’ sense of the best way to
persuade the audience.

The proponents stressed that
supporting Operation Desert Storm
is “not about oil" but rather about
protecting human lives and the fu-
ture of humanity. Magill alleged
that Saddam Hussein. who he re-
ferred to as the “Butcher of
Eaghda " poses a threat of global
signiﬁcance and warned that inac-
tionwouldleadtoafutureof”justice
by the swor Karol stated that
merely continuing sanctions would
only “postpone" casualties when
considering the achievements and
future goals of an expansionist
leaderlike Hussein. Tarpey talked

of the need for the US. to uphold
the United Nations principles of
InternationalLawandhumzinrights
which continue to be violated by
Hussein.

The opposition questioned the
high priceofactivating us. troops
and its effccion the future. Zaring
argued that acting against world
public opinion by sending in
troops cripples the possibility of
establishing a new “World 0r-
der” and amore peaceful f uturei
Clerkin claimed US troops are
merely “mercenaries" since the
price ottheir polieiug the world
will be paid by the Allied
countries. Wittstrtick reminded
the audience that Bush's call for
“complete and total defeat” of
Hussein parallels the Versailles
Conference 0f1919 and the condi—
tions which helped Hitler rally
support.

Audience participation is a ma
jor component of Union debating,

though it is limited by one proce

the debate, which states that audi»

throughout the debate individuals

Although Grinnell College’s
student population is close to 85%
out-of-state, there are several from
Grinnell and the surrounding areas.
Some of these studenm gathered in
South Lounge Wednesday after-
noon to discuss their experiences
coming from GrinnellHigh School
to the college. The discussion was
sponsored by Mortar Board as part
of an ongoing project to aimed at
improving town-gown relations.
The students involved were Kris
Hauser. Alexis Jimenez, Kim
Shelley. Chad Stuchis and Jason
Wagner.

The students hadawide range of
perceptions about the college when
they were in high school. Some
said that they knew very little about
iL Others had spent a great deal of
time on campus attending various
lectures, concerts and films or
working in Burling Library. Those
who knew the most had taken
classes, suehasCalculus. here while
they were still seniors in high school.
One woman related a story of get-
ting guestpasses to attend parties at

Gardnerand Hector‘s when shewas »

a hometown college

in high school.

According to the students, this
range of viewpoints is representa-
tive of Grinnell High School stu-
dents in generalt At worst. thehigh
school kids make generalizations
such as “all Grinnell students are
strange,” or “all Grinnell students
are homosexuals." At best, they see
Grinnell as being highly prestigious
and intellectualt

The students tended to agree that
most college students overestimate
the tensions between town and col~
lege. They say most town residents
do not resent college students and
that many are, in fact, appreciative
of the advantages brought to the
town by the college. The lown

dents who attend Grinnell,

Negative attitudes toward the
college generally come from a few
townspeople who have not been to
college. said the participants in the
discussion. These people tend to
stereotype Grinnell students as
snebbish and wealthy outsiders.

The students report that there is
a substantial division between the
campus and the rest of town. Live
ing in town is very different from
living at the college. This enables
them to ignore the fact that they are

a family member or acquaintance

Several audience members felt
that outbursrs caused confusion us
to the ideas being expressed since it
was difficult to hear part or all of
the questions. “Individuals yelling
out before being recognized be
came annoying and detracted from

the debate.” stated Becky

bowenthal.

The launching of paper
SCUD missiles atproponoan of
the measurewas snickered at by
some and groaned a! by others.
One angered student questioned
the maturity of such an action
and felt that “the treatment of
lives being threatened and the

implicationsofwarare being treated
by Grinneliians of mainly upper-
middle class, non-military back—
grounds as just another issue to
attach their llbcml ideals ID,"

According to coradvisor Mark
Montgomery.assistantprefessorof
economics. Grinnell audiences have
picked up“preity well" on the spirit
of participation and are still in the
process of leaming the dimensions
within which they can play. He

pointed out that the responsibility
ofmaintaining order rests foremost
with the Speaker, stnce his/her dis-
cretion is the law of the house. The
audience members at Sunday's dc—
batc were limited to standing at
their seat: to pose questions,
\Vl’lUClIS the Speaker at the second
tlchate allowed the audience to ad-
vance to the podium, Montgomery
also stressed that the debater must
learn to keep order among the nu
dicnce. Overall, he felt that
Sunday's audience showed signs
otlonrntng their roleand expressed
optimism about the future of the
Grinnell Debating Union.

First time debaier Tarpey felt
the audience's presence from the
other Sldc or the podium. After
attending the tirst two debates, she
decided debating would be a “fun"
experience. The audience created
the biggest challenge for her, “the
hardest part is responding and
thinking on your feet but what a
rewarding feeling when you shoot
[someone] down!"

Preparation for a Union style
debate is different titan that of an
American debate because instead
of spending hours of preparation
anticipating questions from the
opposition for the latter, one must
be prepared to respond to anything
during their speech. According to
fortner American high school de-
bater, Lev Kaye, “the responses to
the audience‘s questions by the
debaler Show his or her real mettle.”

Veteran debater Clerkin, in his
third Grinnell Union debate was
excited about the clear signs of
campus acceptance of the Union
which he equated with a great po-
tential for future growth. He noted
that 200 was a very good tum-out
for a Sunday night on Grinnell
campus. Clerkin added that an in-
creasing number of people are be-
coming involved in all areas of the
debating union.
