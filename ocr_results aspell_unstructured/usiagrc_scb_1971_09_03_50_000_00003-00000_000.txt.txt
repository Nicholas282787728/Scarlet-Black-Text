KDIC Hope--Creative Programs

by Toby Wosk

What's in store for Grinnell
from KDIC (88.5 F.M.) this
year? “More creative pro-
gramming," hopes Bill Tho-
mas, KDIC programming di-
rector.

Thomas would like to see
more students create their
own programs this year, in*
stead of just play music for
a couple hours. "Program-
ming and Production," at new
.course started in the com-
munications department this

1, year, will provide training in
production of radioprograms.

Thomas hopes that the course

‘ will spur more student’
created shows.

These shows could consist
,of anything from interviews
to sound montages or radio
plays. "I'd like to make KDIC
into less of a record player,
which is just about what it
is right now," said Bill.

Radio tapes from other Sia’
tions could help make this
change come about. KDIC is
a member ofa tape exchange
known as KRABNebula.Tapes
from the tape group will be
coming throughout the year
for KDIC use.

”Day in Cairo," already re?
ceived, provides on-the—scene
coverage of the taul situation
in Cairo, Illinois, where ra-
cial violence has become a
way of life.

"An Interview with Ronnie
Davis" is another taped pron

country."

Clayton Lee, KDIC Station

Manager, joins with Bill in
his hopes for change this year
in the station, which he hopes
to see become more than “a
turntable of sophisticatedmu-
zak." More community par-
ticipation is one of his goals
for the station this year.

"I don’t see why we can’t
completely fulfill our role as
a non-commercial educational
staion," Clayton said. He
hopes to extend KDIC liste-
nership beyond the campus in?
to the community, by, for
example, interviewingtown fi~
gures, such as city council
members, publishing a pro

Improvements

Trees Add To Campus Beauty

Major improvements under-
taken by Buildings and GroV
unds this summer include the
planting of 700 trees around
campus and the renovation
of Cowles and East and West
Norris halls.

Improvements of the Norrie
ses and Cowles included a
complete paint job in the li-
ving quarters of the halls.
All screens were replaced
in Cowles, and carpet was
installed in all Norris halls
ways except the stairwells.
Loose partitions in the Nora
rises were anchoredand aiul-
ked, to cut down on the noise
that students living in thehalls
complained about last year.
Hall toilet facilities were
changed in the Norrises, bet
cause the hall will be a (:07
educational dormitory this
year,

"We have accomplished a
bout 75-80 per cent of what
the students recommended
last year in their petition,”
says Dale Hawn, Director of
Buildings and Grounds. "We
think it is a tremendous imr
provement, but students will
have to live in it awhile be
fore we know for sure.”

Soundproofing
One request listed in the per
tition which could not be ful-
filled at this time asked that
steps be taken to improve
the sound proofing problem
that had plagued the hall since
it was built. Norris residents
had asked that baffles be in*
stalled in the cold air ducts.
to cut down on thenoise trans
mission. Noise from one room
on a floor can be heard in
most other rooms on the same
side ofa hall through the ducts.
However, the costs of doing
the job now would have been
prohibitive, as the grates are

Students Practice Russian life In Dorm

by John Wylie
Alittle piece of Russia exists
here on the edge of the Grin-
nell Campus. Utilizinga cont
vertetl house, fifteen Russian
Language students have start
ted their own living expet
rience, informally known as
Russian House. SpeakingRus-
sian, listening to Russian mun
sic, and eating Russian food,
the students are attempting to
improve their knowledge of
the Russian language, to es,
tablish brotherhood and frie-
ndship, and to study the cult
ture of “Mother Russia and
the other socialist nations of
Eastern and Central Furopc.”
To further these goals, they
have established their ownpo»
litical hierarchy, with George

Shybut serving as Party Se-
cretary, Althea Kallas as
Commissar of Internal Afr
fairs, Mike Drayton as Com-
missar of Cultural Affairs,
Howard Miska as Commissar
of Propaganda and David
Clampett as Commissar of
Defense. Earlier reports that
Commissar Kallas was in rea-
lity President of Russian
House were describedas ”res
Visionist lies spread by ene~
mies of the Revolution" by
official RH sources.

Other members of the house
fill the positions of Commis-
sar of External Affairs and
the Treasury, Chicfof the KGB
(Soviet Secret Police) and
Ambassador to the Trustees

Of course, in reality all these
titles are equal, since, as
Commissar Miska pointed out,
"All members are equal ‘
only some are more equal
than Others.”

The house has been com-
pletely renovated for the Rus*
sian experiment. Russian pos—
ters of an educational nature
dominate all the walls so that
“the education in the ways
of Lenin and Marx may con-
tinue whether one is eating,
sleeping, studying, or taking
a shower.”

Russian house has planned
some open house activities,
but may close them because
they fear the "changing poli—
tical climate at this time."
Members of the house are
quite secretive about many of
their activities, including a

Nor was action taken this
summer to improve the poor
lighting in Norris dormitory
rooms. According toMr.Wal-
ker, Dean of Administration,
the College plans to confer
with students before deciding
exactly what to do.

In the past five or sixmonths
the College has planted seven
hundred trees around the
campus. Buildings and Grou-
nds plans nOt to water these
trees, so a certainpercentage
is expected to die; hopefully,
75% or more of those planted
will survive.

Elms Die

Over the past tenyears about
350 elm trees have been cut
down on the Grinnell cam—
pus; thirty-five more were
cut down this summer, lea-
ving an estimated 30 die’
hard elms still gracing the
campus.

New water supply mains were
installed for both hot and cold
water on South Campus. Cold
water, hot water and hot cir-
culating pipes were replaced
from Mears to Loose. The
hot water circulating pipes
provide a supply of hot water
close to the halls, so a stu-
dent need not wait 5 minutes
for hot water to reach him
after he turns on the mter.
B&G electricians reewired
Read Hall. Although merchave
been plans for three summers
now to re-wire and re-plpe
Grinnell House, B&G has run
out of time each summer,
which can be done only after
student residences are taken
care of. This summer B&G
again ran out of time, so the
job still remains to be done,
Over 100 student rooms had
to be repainted this summer,
says Hawn, "since we found
the existing finishes net at
a level we like to maintain
in the dormitories."

Tennis Courts

Seven faculty houses were
painted in places where paint
was badly needed. “This was
not intended to be a complete
exterior paint job," said
Hawn, ”but we did want to
,do the preventive maintenance
most necessary for these
houses."

The Dean of Student Affairs'
office was moved to its new
location, the the former South
Campus Reception Center.

Workmen repaired the roofs
on the North Campus Loggia
and on the new wingoftheSci-
ence Building, and, according
to Hawn, the leaks shouldalso
be Stopped in Clark Hall.

The north tennis courts were
resurfaced at the end of the
summer, and Hawn expects
them to be ready for use by
September 5.
