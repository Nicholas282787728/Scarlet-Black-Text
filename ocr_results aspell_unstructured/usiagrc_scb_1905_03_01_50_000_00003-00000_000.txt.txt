The contrast between life ill college,
and life outside or it is strong indeed.
and it seems especially so to the one
who is spending her lirst year awny
from ller Alma Mater s protecting
care. During her college years, the
girl is responsible only lor herselr. licr
monthly allowance comes regularly
from home, and all that is expected of
her is that she shall Spend it Add
wish: or coursc, there are exceptions
to this statement ill the doses ol‘ those
brore girls whonre dependent upon
their own resources; but certainly'it
is true that the average college girl
is practically rreelrom outside cares
and worries, Her duty is to conduct
herself properly, make the most or her
opportunities and enloy life generally.
Hard work there is ill abundance, but
many pleasures are also there to coun-
ter balance it. Work and play are
mingled in a most hnppy and consist
ent manner, mnklng life as nearly ap
proach the golden menu as we any
where ﬁnd it. Honltily work, harme
less pleasures, congenial companion-
ship and every inﬂuence leading one
upward and onward are, tome, some
of the strongest characteristics of our
college life and happy is the girl who
can feel that She is all essential part
of that life.

' The world axpecrs much of a college
graduate—and iustly, too. For four
years slle has been receiving the best
that her college can give herinow
she, in turn, must. try as best she can
to pass thcse good things on to others.
The girl .vho is unwilling to do this is
unworthy or her Alma Mater, espee
Cially if that Alma Mater lie—ours.
During college days, she has been un-
der the best religious inﬂuences, undel-
tihe inspiration of a deep spiritual life.
Outside oi college her chances ici-
these outer inﬂuences are low; yet she
has an opportunity as never belore to
deepen her own spiritual lire by giving
of it to Others. The teacher. for ex-
ample, is expected to throw horselr
heartily into the religious life of the
community—to teach a Sunday School
class, to help carry the burdens of the
young people's societies and to attend
church regularly. Right here, I think
is one of the greatest opportunities of

the teacher. If she can on Sunday

that of the graduate. To a for great,-
