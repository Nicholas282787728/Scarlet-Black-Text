The Intifada’s
peaceful history

Some students have attempted to frame “the

true nature” or “reality" of the Intifada movements as
“hate" or "violence." This is false, and we would like
to use this letter to clear up this misconception. The
word ‘Intifada’ is Arabic for ‘to shake off.’ Within the
context of an illegal military occupation that has now
lasrsd 38 years, this word signiﬁes the movement of
Palestinians to ‘shake off’ these bonds of occupation.
That said, the Intifada movements include a variety of
non-violent and unarmed protests and should not be
reduced to illegitimate violence such as suicide bomb-
ing.
The first Intifada began in 1987 after an Israeli
army rransportcr ran into and killed four Palestinians
at an occupation checkpoint. It consisted of symbol-
ic protests where Palestinians, many of whom were
children, threw rocks at
Israeli tanks that were
illegally occupying the
West Batik and Gaza,
Never during this first
Intifada were the protesr
tors armed. Many orhcr
nonrviolen: means were
also used during this his
tifada.

The BBC points
out that the first Intifada “included demonstrations,
strikes, boycotting Israeli goods and the civil admins
istration in the occupied territories, and the creation
oflndependent schools and alternarivc social and po-
litical institutions" (Tarik Kafala, “Intifada: Then and
Now,”BBC New: Orr/i715, Friday, 8 December 2000),
The BBC concludes that, “The uprising is credited
with restoring pride to Palestinians downtrodden by
20 years ofIsraeli occupation and forcing Israel ro rhc
negotiating table."

The second Intifada began after Ariel Sharon led
1000 armed Israeli soldiers to the AI-I‘Im’ﬂln Ash—
Sharif, the third holiest site in Islam (which most
Israelis call “the Temple Mount"), in order to send
a message of dominance to the Palestinian people.
Shortly after, Police Minister Ben-Ami publicly ap-
proved of the Israeli army's shooting of Palestinian
demonstrators who protested this act. DCIUOIISU‘R’
tions became widespread, and in reaction to none
violent Palestinian demonstrators being shot, the vio-
lence which, for some, has
come to signify the second

participate, dressing up protest tents for short periods
of time, using whistles, attempting to remove some
of the earth piles that block roads, and standing in
solidarity with owners ofland and homes demolished
by Israeli bulldozers.

There have been non—violent mass demonstrations,
in particular around the assassinations of Palestinian
spiritual leaders. The second Intifada has included
peaceful dernonsrrarions by foreign snidenrs such as
Rachel Corrie, who was killed while attempting ro
prevent an Israel bulldozer from illegally demolishing
a Palestinian's horns, and Joc Carr, who spoke about
his cxperienccs this semester on campus.

The assertion that the word Intifada has a poplr
lat meaning of violence and hate can only exist in a
void of historical fact, We hope that with this new
information about the nonrviolcnt majority of the
Intifada's actions will clear up the misconceprion that
the two Intifadas are movements of hate or violence.

Letters to the Editor

 

Palestinian group misleads

In last week’s letters to the editor of the 588, the newlyrfotmcd
Palestinian Solidarity Group defended their use ofthe Arabic word
“intifada” as their group’s campus usemame.They claimed, as mosr
do, that “intifada” is Arabic for “uprising," in this case, the uprisr
ing of the Palestinians against Israelis who are illegally occupying
and destroying their homeland.They further claimed that this term
is predominantly non-violent. A brief overview ofIslamic/Arabic
political language, identrty politics, and international law, however,
offers an alternative conclusion.

As Dr. Bernard Lewis explains in his book, The Poll/ital L/m-
glmgt a/Ir/rmr, Muslims define their political struggles not in the
Western terminology of up versus down, but in terms of nearer ver-
sus further awayithat is, ncsrcr or further away from Allah's path.
The last passage ofthe Koran informs us that one is nearerto Allah’s
path the more one resists the temptations to negotiate offered by
noneMuslims.

Hence, when the Palestinian Intifada of 2000 erupted, it was
nor an “uprising" against Israel, who had just offered the Palestine
lans nearly all of the land that Israel captured during the 1967 War,
but an essentially Islamic tesuigence to protect Palestinian commu—
nal solidarity in the face of what most Muslims perceived as un»
precedentetl Israeli/Western pressure to lure them into submission
through negotiations.

Evidence ofthis came when Palestinian suicide bombers entered
Israel predominantly via Palestinian towns from which Israel had
recently withdnrwn rather than from those in which the Israeli army
was most active,

Also, as far as international law is concerned, the two most im-
portiint UN resolutions concerning rhc IsraelirPalestiiuan conﬂict
do not accord with the claims of Grinnell’s Palestinian Soldiariry
Group.The 1947 UN partition of Palestine was accepted by Zions
ists and nrosr ofthe Wcsr, bur the Arab countries rejected it, and
they instead were so eager to declare war against the Zionists that
they attacked even before their armies wcrc prcp. ”d lo do so,

In their haste, the Arab leaders, notably Iraq's Nuri Said, ens
couragcd the Arabs in Palestine to temporarily evacuate their homes
until they were no longer under Zionist “rhrcar.” Sixry»cighr percent
ofthe 1948 Palestinian refugees followed Nuri Said's advice,and the
others weie expelled by Zionist foices who would have lacked the

Can we actually
talk about it?

In regards to Msl'arbough's guest column otlast week, I have
this to say- My wife Meredith and I were the couple rncnrioncd,
Our costume idea was conceived long ago, and worn in the spirit of
what I assume ro bc Mary blames, an act of play in a controlled
setting.Thc dance is a place were we ofthe Grinncll community can
enact cultural stereotypes in the name otfun.Thc normal cosnrmcs
are images ofmuscuiinc and feminine that would he vcry oll'ensivc
in morhcr context, a communal understanding precludes this

My question is, does the ortcnsivcncss otaur costumes lie purely
in geopolitical currency, or is there another issue ar work? Is a ccrrain
performance mole egrcgrous because it deals with ethnicity as ope
posed to gender? Or is this so meiely because the latter is the norm
at IVIary B,while the formcr is not.) Miss l'arbrough’s words, spoken
and written, have done inc a service insofar as they have caused me
to question the significance of my actions, even though I do not
rhink 1 understand hei veiy well in this. I hope our costumcs were
not disturbing merely due to being outside the ordinary (for Mary
B, the ordinary bcing gender play), for the alternative seems to be a
subsumption of gender investigations under those of race and cth-
nicicy. This is I thrnk inaccurate and precisely backwards.

A filial word: I think the late dialogue concerning selfrgoverr
rrsnce and the many discrete situations (including this one) therein
are betraying a weakness on the part orrhc campus and most clearly
those who make it up, It is easy to post on Plans, easy to wrirc a
letter such as this one, and very easy to form a campus group. It
requires more courage and integrity to talk with someone one on
one in correspondence or in person, the sort of courage that could
make it socially unacceptable to be destructive and in general an ass.
As difficult and contentious as it might be to articulate this,I think
it is an easy thing to understand. Those who are asses or pretend
to be should be made to feel that their actions are unwelcome. The
alternative is the administration doing whar many have pointcd out
they have been doing of late: treating Gr nell studcnrsdikc chil—
dren. Because if you can't talk to people and solve your problems,
that is what you are.

pretext to act had the Arabs not first attacked them (whether Zlon'
ist leaders David ben-Gution and Ariel Sharon would have wanted
to attack anyway is a moot point).

The other UN resolution crucial to this conflict is #242, which,
contrary to popular bclrcfmrncludrng even the beliefs of high-rankv
ing UN offiials, does not call on Israel to evacuate the territories of
Gaza, the Golan Heights or the West Bank (or the Sinai Penine
sula).

Rather, 242 calls on Israel and the Arab states to negotiate
boundaries that have still not yet been finalized,largely as a result of
Arab inrransigcncc in recognizing Israel‘s right ro sxisr.

The Arab leaders, and most Arabs (97 percent), still refuse to
recognize Israel because of their aforementioned belief that negotiar
tion is a ployiin this case, a ploy to divide and conquer them into
the fake “paper state—lets" that Western imperialists carved out after
World War I to protect oil and Zionist interests. They see Islamic
unity as the only solution to these problems, and accepting interna
tional (unrlslamic) law as a context for negotiations would he the
ultimate blasphemy. In turn, the attempt to create a Westernrstyle
Palestinian State will only anger Muslims further, because--in ad-
dition to implying Isracl’s righr ro cxisr on sacred Muslim land-4t
would divide the land ofPalcstine, a territory they see as crucial for
Islamic survival, from the rest ofthe Islamic world.

Evidence for this perception came several months ago when
Israeli journalist Klralcd Abu Toamch analysed poll data from the
Palestinian territories indicating that Palestinians overwhelmingly
favored “democracy like the Israelis have (i.e. to be a stepping stone
for either Western or Islamic conquest ofthe other)" over ”democr
racy like France and Britain have (i.e. to he a boring, secular state
without any revolutionary tcrvor)." or, in rhe recent words of an
influential Muslim himself, Iran's Ayatollah NourirHamedani:
“World Arrogance its, the us. and the Western powers] is creating
a trinity of evil: heresy, divisiveness, and Zionism, in order to weaken
the [Iranian] people's spirit and to create division and disagreement
with respect to our regime...The.spreading of prostitution and evil
tliings,the creation ofa mentality ofinfcriority. and rhc propagation
ofcrazy ideas such as secularism, liberalism, and humanism are [all]
parr of our cncmies’plans to sow disunity in [our] society..."

To be free

This is a short response to David Archer’s article “(but Glor‘
Communism,"which appcarcd in the last sods issue.

I wear communist symbolsrhcrctore, according ro Archer, 1 am
one of those “superficral and callous members or our community."
My first question to David is whether he even asked us the reasons
why wc wcar rhose symbols, bcfore he quickly jumped to the accusar
tion that we are “glorifying communism.” More impoitanLIy, two is
sues here are at stake: first, whether some pcoplc on this campus can
choosc ro wear communist symbols, second. whctliet some people in
this coilcgc, if they are Communists/Nlarxists, may feel free to express
their dissenting beliefs.

Perhaps I should srarr by explaining whyI weal IVIao's red star and
his usage. I do not deity that I wear those symbols pardy for fashion,
bur my reasons ale far mole personalthan that. I wear rlrcnr because I
simply want m minim/wt a historic era in which my grandparents and
parcnts lived through, and the many joys and pains they experienced.
Wearing those symbols is a way rhrough which I can relate to part of
my heritage and an integral part ofChina's hisrory. In sum, I am not
a communist, and wearing such symb Is is certainly no political skater
mont.Therctore,i am neither glor g communism nor embracing
it.

Yet what most concerns me about the article is this: that Archer adv
vocates a doctrine that inherently contradicts the principle ofa liberal,
multi-cultural and open-minded Grinnell Community. Views such as
Archer's not only infringe upon surdcnts' basic nghts to display their
own individual sense offasliion by wearing communist symbols, but
also encroach on individual beliefs in communist political ideology.

In the column, Archer expressed dismay at the collegc's failure in
"not adequarcly confrontling] " communist symbols, however, it is pro
cisely this tolerance that allowed me to wear those symbols without
encountering any incidents of reproach.

And finally, from my pcrspccrivc, the very essence or this corn-
munity is ro allow a huh/1y exchange ofperspectives and display of
different ideas. I value this fieedom most on campus. That is also
what I like most abour this country
