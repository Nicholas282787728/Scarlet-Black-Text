Most college students are preoccupied
with their relationships and the problems
that the relationships bring to a liie oi
academic intensity. Even if a man or
woman is not involved. the pressure many
students feel to be in a “spectal relation-
ship” with someone can cause a lot oi
stress. What. then. must life at Grinnell be
like for those special students who manage
successfully to combine school work and a
family of their own?

Steve Fors. a sophomore, was married
the August before his freshman year and
now has a soil. Brian. “I have to [it
everything into my priority structure." he
said. "I need to realize that my family is
more important than my grades. than my
school work." '

Fors works hard. though, to maintain a
good GPA and "some type oi
studiousness" so that he can go out into the
world and support his iamily later on.

Being married made It difficult to make
friends here at Iirst. considering that he
had so many ditierent preoccupations "i
had to think about my wile and child It
took my iriends a while to realize ttiat l
Couldn't just go to the Forum whenever I
wanted; I had to check it out with my
wife."

Fors said that other students mostly just
kidded him about the situation. Having
had a iriend \vho'got married two years
beiore his own marriage, Fors was aware

“Marriage in this country

that is unreal.”

Juggling extra activities with iamily lite
and studying oiten leads to problems

because I iust need to spend time with my

It is not only studying that is affected.

Gallic myths
stripped naked

by Mayrlee Chai

It is a “fact” well \known to all
Americans that the French are very
haughty and fond oi criticizmg Americans,
It is known also that they do not smile as
much as Americans do; their food tastes
great but is meagereportioned and unidenr
tiiiaole because everything is pureed into
a sauce, etc. 0625! vrai, n’est-ce pas?

OI course, it one believes that, one must
also believe that they find all Americans to
be crude, rude, loud germophobes.

Well, all right, Americans are loud. but
the French do smile and are quite Iriendly
to seven Grinnellians who are studying in
Rennes tor the spring semester.

It did not take the Grinnellians long to
discover these ”facts" needed to be
debunked. For example. one myth is that
the French shop every day it is said they
prefer to irequent tiny ‘magasins‘ that sell
only one type or productwlike bread or beet
products or pastryerso that one must go to 3
or 4 just to get everything ior the day’s
meal, This seems to Americans quite lmr
practical

Whereas in smaller towns this may be
true, in Rennes, it is not uncommon to go to
the gigantic hypermarche’s like Carreiour
where everything from fish, Wine, bed~
ding. radios, and appliances are sold in the
same store.

On a typical evening alter most have
finished their work day, the aisles were
crammed with French couples, wheeling
their carts about with grand vitesse.
Unlike American supermarkets, the pro
duce is almost all fresh and Very abundant
while the trozen and canned goods took up
a very small portion oi the market.

when one shopper was asked why she '

prefers the hypermarche to the once-
beloved characuterie and boucherie ol the
center oi the City, she responded, “They
are much more expensive. One shops there
(at the small stores) if one needs
something [or that day of it one forgets
something.“

Also debunked was the myth concerning
French snootiness about their culture's
superiority, Angli sms abound, Along
one street there is a “Peanut’s Bar," “Kar
ty's Burgers." “Railway’s Pub" and “Seat
Sex ‘N' Sun " On television, one can watch
War Games. Klute. Santa Barbar'
Dallas, and the iniamous "Deux rlic
Miami", all conveniently dubbed in

Being a married student is not always a
matter of compromise and tight schedul~
ing‘. them are always the up sidcs. “l think
it's really great to have someone to come
home and talk to." He and his wife share
deep iriendship and help each other emor

the diiiicuit periods.

Steve is an art major at Grinnell. and
Amy vtDl'ks at the Longhorn in town. He
would like to teach art and coach after he
graduates. or to work in a museum.
Although he wants time to do his own art
work. this would be an impractical job
\\ ith which to start out because it would not
provide a steady income

in spite of the sometimes overwhelming
pressures oi student marriage. Steve is
positive about the whole experience. “If
you are dedicated to your iamily. it will
\\0l'k out, but it's going to be hard." he
remarked.

Most students in college are too uncers
till" about their t'ultlres to commit
themselves to marriage or long-term rela-
tionships

A ll'eshmali male contended that he

won't marry until he's at least 28 "1 want
to have plenty oi time to try things out 1
thliik 'unlll death do us part' is antiquated
because it traps people who , e condition-
ed not to go against somet '

Freshman Juliette Willis agreed that
marriage is a sociological convention that
isn't necessary to validate a relationship
She said. "For myself. I don't need mars
huge, but I'll end up married because I've
been trained in that direction My heart
believes that marriage leads to things not
natural. such as having one unchallenged
mate for the rest oi my tile or ieeliiig guilty
over a piece oi papei'.‘

She also argued that. "Marriage in this
country is limited to heterosexual relation-
ships and I think that limiting factor is un-
cool."

Nonetheless. Pliame Camarenai a rest
dent advisor and career development
counselor. says that relationship problems
are the numberone problem that students
come to talk to him about "Young people
in college are given so much permission
and potential to be anything they want.”
Camareiia said. “but they don't know how
to combine studying and relationships and
how to make sacriiices yet "
