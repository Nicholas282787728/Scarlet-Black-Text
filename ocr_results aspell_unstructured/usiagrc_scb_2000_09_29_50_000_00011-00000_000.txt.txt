ln hacketo-back weekend games against
their top two rivals, the Pioneer women showed
why they dominated the Midwest Conference
last year. Unfortunately, they also showed that
outplaying a team doesn't always lead to a win,

Crtnnell was definitely the favorite going
into Saturdays game against 3:. Norbert. and
for most orthe game they played like one. but
a defensive lapse
midway through the
ﬁrst half led' to a
golden opportunity
for the Green
Knights, and they
took advantage ofli.

The Pioneer ofe

troubles too, taking
32 shots on goal,

“This loss was a shock to us and one could

it was a scenario ripped straight from the

“Obviously it was rough to lose to st.

nearly 20 shots and because they are a huge
atelirival," said Conch Heather Bciiiilng.

g Regardless of where the tournament is'
played, the Pioneeiswill be in it, and their ﬁrst
round game could very well be Lawrence, last
sunday’s opponent.

Grinnell showed good composure in
Sunday's game, bouncing back from what could
have been a demoral-
izing loss.

“Coach told us to
let the loss go and Just
learn from it," said

that many of us had
regarding the loss was

The energy cer—
tainly showed, as
Grinnell pushed
