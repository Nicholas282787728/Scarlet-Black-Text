tSyIIucuse Daily oI-angel

The elevator operatoI-s- strike in New York brings
to publIc altcntion Several deplorable situations,
Demanding a Agehour week and a $2 Incrccse Ifor-
merly they worked 54 to so hoursl. the stilkch say

living 'I Employers blame the strike not on the
operators. who, they say. are contcnl, but on the
men who run the unions. Meanwhile, service III
New Yalk is seriously impaired.

But. as far as Students. III the slieltelcd, cnay lives
are concerned. the most deplorable aspect cf the
situation is not the justice or thc strike or the in-
ccnvcmehce it; causes, but the altitude taken toward
it by citizens and fellow students. Thcy are too apt
to blindly condemn the strikers and ignore the back
ground or the “other Side" of the question.

They forget that this stI-Ike. taken as an end. I:
of little consequence. Its importance lies in the Ich
that it. is a determined fight for an ideal. Thc
sirikcrs are fighting not only to increase their pay.
but to show unreasonable employers that they can-
not. be intimidated.

They are husbands, fathers, human beings. If
they are not paid a satisfactory wage they have a
right to strike, to refuse to work for employers who
will not arbitrate. And so far the empoyers have
refused to go half way.

one of the main tenets of American liberty Is the
right of all men to petition for redress oi grievances.
Workers have no other weapon but the strike when
their petitions go unheeded. Had the employers
been halfway willing to aIbitrate long ago this situ-
ation could probably have been avoided.

Fax away as the SLlike may seen it piesents a
vital point forstudent consideration Ccllcgc giadr
hates will be either employers or workers. They
will have to understand situations like the present.
one, for they will be principals n them.

[DEALS IN POLITICS ‘
(Oregon State Barometer)

Two million dollars were made available to Har-
vard university recently for the establishment of a
graduate school of public administration which will
train selected men foI a career in government
Representing more than two-thirds of thc mccmc of
the entire System of higher education III Oiegon
during the last. school year, the money comes to
Harvard as a gift from a. man 76 years old, Lucius
Nathan Littaucr, a graduate of the Harvard class of
’78.

in mulling the endowment, Mr Liitcucr expressed
the hope that the school may “raise an occupation
to c pmfession II He pointed to his 10 years in
congress which had acquainted him with thc neerl
for development of a new tonc in American public
life. .

Grown weary of inefficiency and incompetence In
government. administration, America's thinking peo~
pie should ﬁnd encouragement in the establishment.
of a school Ilevcthl to developing ideals and now
techniques in public service. Within the coming
year, those persons sensitive to the undercurrent: in
party politics will feel cleeply the lack of profesV
Sional standards in a field of activity that should be
the most rcspectcu in America's many-skied lite.

Raising the occupation of politics to the profesr
Sion of public administration, in accordance with
this philanthropist’s hope, involves essential altera-
tiolis in the presentrday politics. To meet. the re—
qllircments of :I profession. the new profession
woulIl engender in Ihcsc chgngcu a professional at
home and racist on the ideal of scrvice over and
above the motive of personal_ rofits.

Fulfillment of Mr. LittauerIs twormillion—acllar
hope is a worthy ambition for HarvurIlIa new school
In its realization may lie thc cure for the many ills
to be found in American public life.
