STUDY HOURS
(From the Iou-n suite Student)

A freshman comes to school. He IS told by his
counselor that he must be sure to learn to study. He is
given n chart that shows just what and how many
hours he is to put on each subject He, perhaps, pledges
a fraternity. The first thing the actives tell him after
he gets the button is that he must learn to study. He is
told that there are “house rules" he must obey. He
must be in his room every night between certain hours
for study.

Wcll, Mr. Freshmen takes all this seriously. For
olic week he tries to live up to his schedule. Then he
finds himself slipping. He discovers that he must study
four hours instead of three to get his chemistry and
that he can get his math in an hour, A week inter a
good show comes to town He snee out and attends.
Maybe he gets caught and gets paddled, Maybe he
doesn‘t.

By the end of the first six weeks, Mr. Freshman is
way off schedule. He has probably broken every house
rule and laughed with all the rest of the pledges when
somebody says something about. study hours,

Study heursl Study hours’ That's all you hear
around here. Can we get no suceor?

It is time that fraternities wake up to the times,
If they want to get their g‘radesithey'll do it. If they
don't. they’ll flunk out. And anything you do about it
Won’t. help, Those that won't study have no place in
college. Let them go.

Don’t. get us wrong. No fraternity house or rooming
house should be a mad house. A man should have sell-
tilde and comparative quiet, f he wants to study. The
way to enforce study hours is not, however, ’to yell
down the hell at thc top of your voice, “Study hours!"
Let study hours take their own course. You’ll be sur-
prised how much studying- can be done during the time
you're arguing and scrapping with John Doe because
he makes so much noise every time he walks down the
hall.

TACT
(From the Marquette Tribune)

Lorinicr, editor of the Saturday Evening Post, once
said; “Tact. is the knack of keeping quiet at the right
time; of being so agreeable yourself that no one can
di agree with you; of making inferiority feel like equals
ity. A tactful man can pull the stinger from a bee with-
out getting stung.”

Too few students appreciate tact and its inevib
able relationship to popularity and friendship. What we
say and do in the presence of others demands consid-
eration, not only for ourselves hilt also for our neigh-
bors. Covered by our shell of conventional Sophisticar
tion, we sometimes forget the possible injury of sarcasm
and irony.

However, since this is an age of sophistication and
since we can recognize that sarcasm—at least, playful
sarcasmsis conventionally condoned, as recipients of
the lack of tact, we should endeavor to harden our—
selves, When we're addressed unpleasantiy, we should
let it float off our backs and forget it. Finally, after a
while, it won’t make any difference, and we'll go hlitheiy
along unmindful of it.

At Michigan State college, Lan-
sing, Mich. they believe in springing
real class dances. The price of ad-
inission to the junior prom this year
was $8, the time. 10 p. m. to 3:30
a. in. And all students attending
were permitted to out all classes af-
ter 3 o'clock on the day of the dance
and all classes the morning after. The
number of cuts permitted at the Mich»
igan State college depends on the
scholastic standing of the students.
For sophomores, juniors, and seniors
on the honor roll class attendance is
voluntary.

Editor,

Grinncll, Iowa.

Dear Sir:

The executive committee which is
planning the peace conference to he
held at Grinnell in April would like
to express its appreciation for the
suggestion made in the editorial in
the Feb, 19 issue. We had not ex-
pected to announce any of our plans
as to speakers until the program was
complete, but it would perhaps be
best to say a. word in regard to the
suggestion made by The Scarlet anti
Black in that editorial.

We have been hoping from the
first to present every intelligent
viewpoint, and it. has been our plan
to have at least one militarist spenlr
to the group. It is somewhat diffi-
cult to secure a, good representative
of that group, and we should be very
glad to consider any names which
anyone may wish to suggest.
Meanwhile, any other suggestions
which may help to make the cons
ference most valuable for the great

greatly appreciated.
Sincerely yours, _
Huburt E. Pye,
Chairman of Executive Cornniittce

Joseph Connrd
Chairman of Speakers Committee
