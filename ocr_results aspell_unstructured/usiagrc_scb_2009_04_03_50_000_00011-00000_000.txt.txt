Thank you, President Osgood, for your timely
response, which demonstrates your understanding of
the value of student voicer Your letter reafﬁrms that
we share many ofthe same interests and concerns. We
too see the need for “a community sense of restraint
and commitment to [the College's] key priorities." It
is this that clraws us to action: the failure of the Col-
lege to act in a manner that is consistent with our key
pnOﬂliCS’in particular our commitment to social re-
sponsibility.

A pointrbyrpoint response to your letter can be
found at 7iolimirrgriliricll,wavrlprerrnm. Here, we
would hke to focus on a few key points.

We would first like to address your concerns rer
garding the fiscal state of the college. To those who
suggest that this is an inopportune or irresponsible
time to undertake this project, we assert that this is e»
acily the moment in which we must reaffrrm our comr
mitmcnt to social responsibility. While we agree that
there is a need for restraint and responsible spending,
our commitment to social rcsponsibilityﬂm: of our
three core values—cannot be compromised in the
name of economic cautiont lfwc only put our words
into actions when the market is good, this is not a core
valuhit becomes a secondary consideration at best.
Furthermore, let us he very clear: riiost ofour demands
would be effectively cost-neutral.

We appreciate yourrecognition ofsmdenlsmunique
voice," and the inregial iole students have played in
enacting change on cainpns. The No Limits Plojcct
is a natural extension of the work that student activr
ists have done in an effort to promote our professed
values. However,students cannot be the sole agents of
institutional change, Efforts must also be made at the
administrative level to demonstrate a genuine comr
niitmenr to social responsibility. We have presented
you with fourteen specific actions that deserve your
immediate attention, We are eager to collaborate once
we have a sincere commitment to implement these
projects, many of which the administration has his
torically claimed to support Unfortunately, you have
thus far engaged with our demands inadequately by
merely rehashing the collegc's marketing rhetoric.

Finally, because the president is " not the sole dc-
cision marker at Grinnell," we continue to hold ac-
countable not only you, but also your administrative
colleagues and the Board of Trustees for failing to
follow through on projects put forth by members of
the College community. As we have documented, the
extensive history of student activism through tradi-
tional channels has produced insufficient results. All
too often, administmt‘ive support has been merely

superficial. Conscqtlcntly,\‘l'e again demand that you
respond to our initial letter and specific demands wirh
acoinprchcnsivc plan for action i cludinga timeline,
formulated with input and collaboration from all those
initially addressed by Monday, April 13, 2009.

Cleveland police interrogations

Picture this: you come back from spring break and
spend a lovely Sunday reconnecting with fnends. You
go to bed to get a good night’s sleep for your first class
back on Monday at 9 m. You are dreaming of the
future Grinncll Water ark, when suddenly you are
awoken by loud hangs on your doorYou open the door
to see a police officer and Steven Briscoc on the other
side as they begin to interrogate you

This story refers to the incident that took place in
Cleveland Hall at two in the morning this past Sunday
night. In response to finding an illegal substance in
Cleveland Lounge (a common space), Grinncll secu»
rity and Grinnell Town Police began to search the first
and second floors of our dorm Anyone caught in the
hallway or the frrst oi second floor was intcrr-ogatcd
and residents were awoken and kept awake by secu-
rity and police forces. They were looking for names or
people who spend time in the lounge to incriminate
in association with substances and personal belong-
rngs found therewe understand the legirimacy ofthe
complaints and accusations against the lounge, espe—
cially in light of the substances found. However, the
manner in which the search was conducted showed a
lack of personal respect for the students in the dorm
and a violation ofour sense ofsccurityr Shining ﬂashr
lights in students faces as they sleep and random in
terrogations were not welcome at two am, the night
before classes bcgan

There is a huge gap in communication between
the administration and the residents of our dormir
tory. There was a noticeable, uncomfortable and um»
pected change in the presence ofsccurity in our home
starting with the beginning of spring break. Security
started coming in at least four times a day and have
continued their rounds regularly it is unfortunate that
Cleveland has been targeted because residents have
begun to feel less safe and less at home. lftlie admin-

istration had cho n other paths to communicate and
educate the residents of the dorm about the Clean Air
Act, such as through our RLC and SAs,ivc would not
feel so accosted. We hope that we all can facilitate bet-
ter communication in the future, in order to prevent
such drastic changes in security measures. Cleveland
has always demonstrated responsible self-governance
and we will continue to do so, ifonly we are allowed.

Hire Rob Lewis for tenure track

We are writing to express our deep disappoint-
ment in the History Department’s decision not to
hire Profcssor Rob Lewis for a tenurertrack position
in Modern European History Those of us who have
been fortunate enough to take a class with Professor
Lewis know that his passion for his subject is unrir
valed, and his energy is infectious. His classes are alr
ways full, and he has inspired many students to major
(or double major) in history.

Not only is he an engaging professor, but Rob
Lewis is also wrlling to dedicate vast amounts oftime
towards helping students with whatever project they
are working onicven beyond the bounds required for
the actual class. Be it an essay contest, a scholarship ap-
plication. or internship advice, Professoi Lewis always
makes himself available to help. We attend Grinncll
College for the opportunity to he taught by professors
like Rob Lewis, who care about teaching and interact»
ing with rheir students just as much as they care about
lilCil' own research,

During the hiring process. students displayed
overwhelming support for Professor Lewis by packing
into ARH 102 for his Friday evening job ralk,some of
us sitting on the floor. The crowd was an academically
diverse group ofstudcnrs, and included majors of not
only history, but ofall disciplines; the student body of
Grinnell expressed broad-based enthusiasm for Rob
Lewis’s candidacy. We wish the History Departmcnr
had placed gieater value on this outpouring ofsrudcnt
support as well as his consistently outstanding class re-
views, and we urge you to reconsider your decision and
hire Professor Lewis for a tenurerlrack positron.

We would also like to take this opportunity to
thank Professor Lewis for the two outstanding years
that he has devoted to us, his students. Professorwn
behalf of every Grinnelliau who read a little deeper
because you engaged them in conversation. on behalf
orcvcry student who researched for your papers and
forgot that it was work, and on behalf of everyone who
you introduced to the world of the Parc des Princes, of
Haussmaim, ofDreyfus or De Gaullo—tharik you,
