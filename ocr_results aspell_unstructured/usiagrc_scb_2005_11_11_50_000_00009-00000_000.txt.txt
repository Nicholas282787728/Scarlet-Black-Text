Ivory tower
to trenches

According to the Grinnell mission
statement, “The College aims to graduate
women and men who can think clearly, who
can speak and write persuasively and even
eloquently, who can evaluate critically both
their own and others'iders, who can acquire
new knowledge, and who are prepared in life
and work to use their knowledge and their
abilities to serve the common good.“

We can persuasively deconstruct Grin-
ncll‘s environmental policies, eloquently
advocate Colombian workers' rights, evalur
ate oppression in texts, acquire the tools to
subvert Enterheteropau'lrtrchal norniativiry
and use this knowledge for the well-being
of other Grinncllians in our ardent defense
of Grab BcGo, but not of the future of Japa-
nese classes.

It isn’t that Grinnellians don‘t care; cleats
ly many support a wide range of national
and international justice causes. Grinncl-
linns ﬁght for the underdog, revel in contro»
versy and celebrate activism, but either from
a comfortable distance or divorced from
academia

Those who are apathetic leave the ideas
in the books when they exit the classroom
setting. Those who are motivated to help
change the world often join organizations
ﬁghting for justice but fail to live up to the
ideals they espouse in the academic and at
tivist group setting on an individual bnsrs.

Many who helped victims of Katrina do
not call attention to cases of racism on the
Grinnell campus. Many students united
to develop an ideological opposition to the
Coca Cola Company do not investigate the
exploitation ofLatinns in Iowa. IVInny {ems
inists accept oppression outside of gender
study Classes and the Feminist Action Co-
alition. Often, if there isn’t a teacher with a
grade book or a student leader with a group
project, apathy sets in,

Now, with Japanese classes being cut
and Japanese professors leaving without rc-
placements, students should examine how
an oppressive tradition manifests itself in
academic priorities at Grinnell. japancsc
and Arabic may be emerging as equally or
even more important languages than French
or Russian in terms ofworking for the com-
mon good in our modern society.

However, Grinnellinns do not apply
their understanding of marginalization to
insist on equal prioritization for these classr
es. The Japanese classes, already relegated
to a part of the Chinese department, are
under the threat of extinction, and Arabic
is only offered as an Alternate Language
Study Option program, If we claim to be
progressive students,we must insist on pro-
gressive classes.

The difference between examining a
book or a nation for injustice and examining
the Grinnell community one-on-onc is a
matter of comfort levels. It is safe to attack
oppression from the ivory tower, but down
in the trenches it’s a different matter, espe—
cially when rhe trenches are also home.

If Grinnellians applied theories they
learned in the classroom about economic
exploitation, social inequality and the his—
tory of oppression to our present situation,
we could push ourselves and each other to
live Grinnell’s mission statement, not just
in our noble and distant pursuits, but in our
everyday lives. Then we could break out of
the binary of academia and activism and
even have some fun creating some clever
metaphor about studying Japanese in anir
malrfrieiidly, ivoryrplated trenches.

Wainright clarifies, gives thanks

l‘llSl of rIll, I would like to thank all of you
have expressed concern and offeied support
lennnor express my "raumdc enough for the
sensitivity, thoughtfulness and overwhelming
support shown by frrends, faculty and fellow
students. .

your support has been tremendous and
meaningful, and is largely responsible for my
current hopeful and positrve demeanor. In ad-
dition, I would like to take this time to correct
whnt rrrry have been a few misleading, albeit
rechnicrlly corrccr, facts reporred in last week's
article “Wainright Pleads Guilty to Misde—
meanor Charges.

Most people to whom I have spoken regard
ing rhe article have expressed concern about my
10:00 pm. to 6200 mm, curfew. With respect
to this curfew, I should state that, although
tecluiically I am supposed to be at my place of
residence during the wee hours of the night, this
stipulation is simply infeasible. Not only do I
spend most weeknights in Burling until 1 in the
morning, brrt furthermore, as many ofyou know,
1 close the Forum Grill one night a week

My probation offrccr is well aware of this,
and has allowed me to be on campus at whatev-
er hour, so long as I am not “roaming the streets
in the middle of the night, getting into trouble".

Which Is to say, rfyou see me reading Man m
the library at 10: 30 at night, you no longer have
to feel compelled to drop whrtcver you are do
ing. and call rhc police

Additionally, l have cleared up the stipula-
rion regarding my communication with people
with a past crrnrinal record so don't worry, half
of south campus, we can still do tea sometime
(and in public, tool),

Furthermore, the result that my family, my
lawyer and l were hoping for was a dcfcrred
judgment, not a differed judgment. lfl had
received a deferred judgment the misdemeanor
would have been erased from my otherwise
clcrn record (asrdc from a few parking tickers)
after successﬁil completion of my probation.
Unfortunately, the two years ofprobrtion, which
have nullified, amongst other things, my hopes
ro study abroad in Costa Rica this spring, were
not deemed sufficient to teach me this costly
lesson in silence; rather I will be explaining this
paragraph mistake for the rest of my life as an
American citizen.

However, I should add that, on the whole,I
am gtareﬁil that the scntcncc was not worse-—
after 2111,] could have been a felon, or incarcerat»
ed for five years. Thankfully I am still attending
Grinnell, and in all likelincss be able to go home

for vacations. Furthermore, not being able to
drink will enable me to shed the srrcssﬁil burden
of an intense social life, and allow me to devote
.rll army tune to relaxing with my studies!

Finally. because I have learned that I am
prone to bcrng mlsundetstood,I would like to
comment that my picture accompanying the
Oct. 28 article was intended to be humorous,
and not intended to scare anyone.

I apologize ifthis disclaimer is insulting to
the collective intelligence of the Grinnell cams
pus, but i suppose nowadays one can never be
too careful In rhe face of hardshrp, laughter is
often the best remedy. Moreover, although cats
planation can’t make a joke any ﬁinuicr,I invite
anyone to email me with any lingering queSr
tions, or ityou would simply like to talk to me
about anything i have said or done.

That being said, i would like to thank eVs
erybody once again for all their incredible sup
port, but furthermore, emphatically encourage
all to extend this support to each other. For
ultimately, I believe that is the essential call of
self—governance: take care oteach other. Clearly,
this responsibility towards each other is relevant
and critical now more than ever. On that note,
take care.

Bin Laden’s nuclear arsenal threatens homeland

Last week's Rosenﬁeld symposium on Terr

rorism and Weapons ofMass Destruction left.

much to be desired. However, there was one
very speciﬁc issue that anyone who has read
significantly about the topics on which this
symposium focused should point out,

In the late 19903, a report appeared in the
openrsoulceliterature(unclassiﬁedintelligence
information) rhat has since been repeated and
legitimized with disturbing regulurrty. The
report basically claims that, in 199s, Osamr
brn Laden purchased anywhere from “r few"
to “over 20" nuclear weapons for 530 million
and over $700 million in Afghan heroin or
opium flom fOImet soviet special forces and
the Chechen and Russian maﬁas somewhere
in the republics ochnrrnl Asia.

If this report sounds like some combina-
tion of conspiracy theorizing and‘ right-wing
propaganda, please consider the following:.

First, in 1997, a Russian General named

Democracy for D.C.

No taxation Without representation—and—
Free D.C. These are two ofthc slogans you may
have seen on loggia signs in Sept. highlighting
D.CXs lack offull democracy. While these slo—
gans arc powerful,on rhis Veteran’s Day,I’d like
to offer another: “End the Hypocrisy, Bring
Democmcy Home."

Over two thousand American soldiers have
died' In Iraq and almost two hundred and fifty
have died In Afghanistan. Four of those sol:
diets were from the District of Columbia.

Thosc four veterans from our nations caplr
tal sacriﬁced their lives just like their counter-
parts who enlisted from the fifty states. But,
unlike those other soldiers, the four soldiers
from DC. had no voice in either of the decir
sions to go to war.

District residents have no voting represen-
tation in Congress—no senators, and only a
non-voting delegate to rbe I—louse ofRepresenr
ratives. These veterans’ deaths remind us that
D.C.‘s s ‘ond—class citizenship is notjust about
taxation without representation. It is about her
ing sent to war, and dying in war, without a real
voice in the Congress that authorizes that war.

Its time to right this wrong. On this Vct~
errns Day, exercise the power you have that
District residents do not share. Contact your
senators and representarrvcs in Congress Tell
them to end the hypocrisy and bring democv
racy home.

_ Alexander Lebed officially conﬁrmed that a)

the Soviet Union did indeed develop tactical
nuclear weaponsihoth the infamous “surtcase
hombs"and artillery shells~that could be de»
livered vra special operations forces and b) rlrar
he could not account for as nrany as over 100
of rhcse weapons,

What lends this report Its credibilityis that
most analysts agree with it and thrr no one
has successfully dchunkcd it Support for this
story has come from awrdc urncty of highly
credible sources, including terrorism analysts
like Yossef Bodansky and Rohan Gunaratna,
current and former U.S. ofﬁcials, and Russian,
Kuwaiti, Pakistani, and Israeli sources of varir
ous capacities (to be fair, Dr. Graham Allison
of IIaIvard—who has authored the best book
on the prospect of nuclear lsl-rmisr terrors
lsmilms not voiced his agreement. ).

Those who acknowledge their failure to
drsprove this report include one Franklin Mill-

er, who spoke at the Rosenfreld event.

Mr. Miller had a great deal of power over
the Pentagon's nuclear policies for several years
and was in control of the White House situ-
ation room on 9/11 and so his word should
carry a great deal of weight with regard this
issue,

After he was done with his speech and a
session of Q8; A, I asked Mr. Franklin pri-
vately whether he had seen this report and, if
so, whether he viewed it is credible. He inrrncr
diately interrupted me by denyrng that he had
seen any intelligence that could independently
corroborate the report.

When I further inquired how I should
judge the claims of terrorism expert Yossef
Bodansky ifI have no way of independently
verifying his allegations, Mr Miller began to
blush and, with a slight smirk, told me that the
report might be true.

Boycott questions disgusting

Let me ask Mr. Postman, speciﬁcally, a
rhetorical question: ifa nvelveryearrold fries
tory worker in Malaysia dies of exhaustion
and malnutrition in a shoe factoryrun byMa-
laysian business men, but owned by Nike, will
s/he go to hell bceause s/he wasn’t baptized in
the Roman Catholic Church?

My question for Mr. Postman is just as
inappropriate and irrelevant as his question
to the Coke boycotters. My question, like his
question, does not address anything relevant
to the death and mistteutr
ment of workeis either
directly or indirectly by
Norrh American, Europe
an, African, Asian, South
American, or Antarctican
corporations.

Instead, his question forms it false relar
tionship between us, the educated elite (what
are we, ifwe aren’t that?), and those murdered
souls in Columbia. I-lis question, his atti-
tude, secs our role to be that of saviors, those
who are responsible for solutions and ixtoner
ment and, most importantly, those who have
the power to offer and enforce solutions and
atonement. He asks, How can we hold Coke
responsible for rhe killings of their workers if
we can't evaluate the altemntives. . ..>"

What a backward, rnappropriatc, disgust-
ing question. For Mr. Postman, the crime

The point of the protest is not to grab
the murder weapon bullo stream
to author/lies . ’l-le’s gala gun!”

does not prefrgurc its appropriate solution; if
we cannot tell a person horv not to murder,
they have every right to do so.

Our role, therefore, would be to interccde
to save the murdered workers in Columbia
by telling their murderers how to go about
things wirhout murdering. Their crime, their
responsibility becomes our crime, our respon-
srbility. This is absurdity.

No hunger- strike, no sitrin, no picker line,
no match, no boycott has ever magically cons

jured up the power to stop
the conditions protested
against. Protests inher-
ently concede the point of
direct power in stopping
the actions they oppose.

Instead, protests in-
directly foree a more powerful agent’s hand.
Most protests address more publicly objec—
tionable actions, such as murder, in order to
draw attention to more speciﬁc realities, such
as the treatment of factory workers in a Cocar
Cola plant.

The point of the protest is not to grab the
murder weapon out of the murderers hand,
wrestle him to the ground and tie lumisuch
is the role of revolution and revoltibut to
scream to the aurboriries while tlrcy, too, stand
and witness: “He’s got a gun!"

Boycott, cont. p. H
