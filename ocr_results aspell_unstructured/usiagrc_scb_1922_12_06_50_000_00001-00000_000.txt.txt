Turkish acceptance of any kind or
international commission to supervise
and control the straits will depend
‘largely upon whether or not Amcl'iCa
participates, according to the most
reliable information given to the Des
Moines Register correspondent
Lausanne yesterday. The Turks, it is
understood, will consider only Amer-n
can presence as a guarantee of the
hona fide inter-national character of
such a commission. Furthermore, the
Turks will accept such a commission
only if it is without military force.
They also remain firm on their rice
mood that warships be not allowed
unrestricted passage through the Dal-A
danelles and the Bosphorus. .
