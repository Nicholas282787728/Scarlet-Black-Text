In defense of the double- sided

In the ii11- aginaly world of/m/w r'i'onallilt'lii,

would likely conic from
tree plantations in areas
with relatively little alteik
native use and ecog tem

National forests house
111g endangered species contmgenrly dried
by 1hc general public, and foresrs providing
valuable ecosystem services would be priced
proh1b1rively high based on the valtle otinrict
ecosystem.

In the real We 1d, however, a complex web
of perverse subsi s and the failure of 1he
market price to internalize unintended social
and envrronmental effects mean that the de.
cision to clearcut a forest can produce results
that, 111 economic-speak, are far from Pareto-
efficient.1'll give an example of each of rhese
possible shortcomings.

Sweatshops:

srill, I have succumbed 1o 1Ln1p1111ons, on mo1c
than one occasion of'pilfcring" prinnng paper
for extracurricular endeavours. Unlike ProchV
sor Montgomery, however, I do not think that
sweatshops are good for developing counrncs.

The core argument on sweatshops is dair-
gerously entangled in economic justification,
and forgets (or 1gnorcs) that we are dealing
1vth human beings, and nor 1obots.

l reﬁise to believe that citizens ofdcvclop-
ing nations are robots, whose 11114111 aporuirlr
cons1sts solely of pick1ng the highest possible
payoffs from a given set of alternatives,without
duc concern as to the nature of the alternatives.
Yet th1s 1s precisely where Professor Monte
gomerys logic is advertently oi inadvertently
lcading us, and I could not disagree more.

Questions for

Six questions I have for the Latin Ameri—
can solidarity Group:

1) You’ve argued that even though Coke is
nor demonstrably responsible for the killings
of union leaders in Colombia, they should be
acting to stop the violence.

Since those responsible for the killings,
the Colombian pammilitaries, are in effect a
branch of the Colombian military, how do you
propose that Coke prevent this violence? You
cant stop an army without an army.

Are you proposing that
we should boycott Coke
unless mey form a private

responsibility of the state
to preserve order so that
citizens and corporations
don’t have to have their own armies?

2) You've argued that even if Coke can't
stop the violence, they should “stop proﬁting
from it.”This would necessarily entail closing
me plants 1n Colombia. Do you really think
eliminating the jobs of union workers is the
best way to protect union rights?

3) You‘ve argued that it’s not your i‘espunr
sibility to explain what Coke can or should do
to solve the problem. How can we hold Cola:
responsible for the killings of rhcir workers
if we can’t ewluatc the alternatives, which in
this case seem to be either forming a militia or

Hal/cyan ever walked into one of

Do you real/y think chm/hating the
militia? lsntrhe most basic job; ofum'on workers IS the best
way to protedunion rights?

In 2004, the federal
governmenr spent roughly
$48 nullion m build loggmg
roads in the ongnss n.1-
tiontrl forest in Alaska and
carried 11 men: $800,000 in
timber rents.

To the extent that printing doublersirled,
coupled wirb Grinnell’s policy againsr buying
paper products from old-growrh foresrs, rcr
duces the logging of our national forests, this
can be seen as a beneﬁt.

A second example otmarket tnlures lead-
ing to inefﬁcient resource use comes from
New York C1ty. in the early 1990s,the city was
hung a considerable water quality problem.

instead of building a multi-billion dol-
lar water treatment plant the planning board
realized that, for a fraction of the price, the
city could pay farmers and landowners in the

Adirondack watershed to conserve forest t'ov-

This “cost" is not lit in: by thc comp- y

and hence the company's actions consuture 11
market failure due to distorted incentive As

ceeds the beneﬁts‘m the company

To bring things full circle, prinring double
sided Is in .1 sense a transaction Cost we are
beating in order to prevent a marginal amount
of logging in our national forests and other
valuable ecosysrcrns.

ln parting, the lcsson we should draw from
all of this is that the most important step
needed is not to reduce consumption per se,
but rather to implement policies seeking to
correct tor market failures by having prices tell
the ecological truth. .

4) You've argued that those who disagree
with you about Coke‘s responsibility for the
killings are being “pretentious" by questioning
the conclusions of the antirCoke movement.

Doesn’t this effectively foreclose the pos

really the best way to fotm school policy?

5) You’ve argued at joint Board that Sena—
tors should vote on the resolution based on
the number or people who showed up at the

Do you think 1hat

6) You argued against rising a ballot, in— '

controversial Joint Board resolution. Robert's
Rules of Order, the guidelines for p11rl11n1en»

resentatives might bc afraid to vote a certain
way, a ballot is an appropriate measure.

Do you really rhink that social pressure is
a legitimate basis for Scnators' decisions? Do
you see any distinction between social pressure
and actual popular opinion?

Print double-sided

Here it is: the eagerly anticipated rebuttal
ofProfcssor Montgomery's article As he cired,
"forest" area has indeed increased in America in
recent years, but I wonder how often you find
200 year»old trees, wetlands and rich biodiver-
s11y- in forests that have “forest nurseries and
seed orchards forest roads, cleared tracts,
[and] firebienks. ...” included in their deﬁnition
(mow Ming)? An increase in trees does not
negarc 1l1e fact that companies like Vicroria's
Secret are putting out 365 million catalogs/year
made from trees logged from irreplaceable old
growth forests, such as the Boreal. We need
to preserve the forests we have, because their
wealth orplanr 11nd animal diversiry will take
hundreds ofycars ro be reproduced.

Which leads me to Grinnell and that pesky
double- siding default. 'lhc paper used in thc
colnge computer 1 s is 100 percenr recycled,
meaning we are rLsponsiblc for no logging 11 all.
However, this guilt free luxury does not comc
cheaply, as iecycled paper costs more than virgin
paper; thus, Grinnellians must exhibit the next
step in the Three Rs: reduce. However, last year
we didn't, and ITS had to buy 400 extra cases of
paper, some of which was only 30 percent res
cycled. Should everyone follow Montgomery's
example of single-siding for irs aestheric value,
Grinnell will likely once again provide .1 mar-
ket for paper that 11 least partly will have come

from endangered forests.

editorial

Vote today!

These initiatives really can make a {liﬂ’iﬁf’
ence. Joint Board's big vote on the future of
Coca-Cola this week was introduced to the
campus discourse o1-c1- a year ago as a pct1e
r-ion coupled with 11 student initiative to end
our contr. 1ct with Coke. The Latin Al‘nel'i'
can Solidarity Group (LAS) and Students
Against sweatshops (SAS) posrcd incendiary
ﬂiers around campus to draw attention to the
issue and Coke was boycotted.

LAS and SAS triumphed this week as 11
John Board resnlnrion to find another sup-
plie1whcn the College’s conrract with Coat
cola expires in 2007.

The ater'age student initiative is not so
lucky As we reported last spring, as many as
15 of the 18 initiatives passed over the last
chrcc years hate not been implemenred.

Last spring, all proposed student initia—
11ves failed because orlow student participa-
tion. Since student involvement reﬂects not
only student interest in the issues, but also
th' lr conﬁdence (or lack thereof) that student
iru tttives actually produce resulu, we should
examine reasons.

First, students disregarded an important
mechanism in the system of selfrgovemarice
Second, most students decided that the initi
tives on the ballot were less relevant than the
demands of their own daily schedules Third,
rhe lack of an SGA advertising campaign
rook 1 high Vote toll, but this seems more an
excuse than an explanation and SGA is ad—
vc'rtising again this semester.

The tonrch would includc the develops
merit of learned helplessness. Students seem
to have seen enough iiuriatives pass to no
effect that logging in to Pioneenveb to vote
seems to them not to be worth the effort.

There is still no roof over Ganesha, the
Hindu god outside Noyce.

Incoming sn1dents have never known an
Express that offers 53. $0 mealreplacement.

Three key elements in the success of
the Coke Boycott were an active, passionate
sponsoring group, a responsive electorate and
college administrators willing to work directly
with students to research the problem and
agree to a solution.

While the level of involvement of the
sponsoring students means a great deal, the
second element is crucial. It is from wide-
spread support in the electorate that student
initiatives denve legitimacy Joint Board this
semester wisely voted down a-measure that
would make initiatives easier to pass—the
language called for voring in favor by 33 pCt~
cent of all students instead of 66 percent of
an at least 50 percent turnout.Though rech—
nically the same number of students would
have to vote in favor of an initiative to puss
it, part of the idea behind the current voting
scheme is that those voting are a “presenter
rive snmple. such a change would have un-
der-mined the idea ofinitiative passage show-
ing overwhelming strident support

PresidentJohn Bohman 06 has etpressed
his personal commitment to seeing this year’s
initiatives through. Without student interest,
though, administrators will be making our
decisions for us, whether they follow through
on the initiatives or riot.
