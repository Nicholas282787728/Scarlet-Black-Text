English protcssor Peter eonn‘eliy, who is
one of the prolessors who teaches the

theorize,” Connelly said, "There is no
sense in teaching theory to those wiio don‘t

Mitford speaks on life
as muckraker

by Margaret Lewis and Beth Johnson

Scarlet and Black:
What do you think about Ronald
Reagan?

Jessica Ivlitiord:

Well, of course we know a lot about him
because we live in California, We've sort ol
known about him ior years. So a long, long
time ago, this was right aiter the
Republican Convention in which
Goldwater was the nominee and Ronald
Reagan had been plugging him like
anything, and so then it was rumored
somehow that Ronald Reagan might be
running for Governor of California . . . in
iact, there were screaming mobs oi sup-
porters from the extreme right wing of the
Republican Party urging the candidacy of
Reagan. So I did an article, and in the
course oi it what I did was go and inter-
view huge numbers of people, I went down
to Hollywood and saw people that Ronald
Reagan had worked with in the days when
they were making war films. which is his
entire war record. by the way, and I rang
up one of the leading republicans of the

state who was an assemblyman, a long
time member oi the Republican Party,
and I said “What do you think of Ronald
Reagan as a candidate tor Governor of
California?” and he said “That’a
ridiculous idea. Reagan is a remnant of the
Goldwater campaign. How can a remnant
of a remnant expect to run ior governor?”
And that was the beginning. During the
course of thalal‘ticle I ran across a thing in
one of the pages in the eiassiiied ads say-
ing, “Ronald Reagan for President, send a
dollar to and then there was an address
somewhere in the Middle West, a post ofr
fice box, for more information and so I
sent a dollar and I got back all this stuff,
But. that. was the best dollar I ever spent
because since then, I’m constantly getting
appeals [mm the Republican Central Com»
mittees as one oi the oldest supporters oi
Ronald Reagan. And so I get all of their
mailings. It’s too bizarre I’ve got a huge
file of all that stuff. That's all I have to say
really about him

health care
center soon

to be a
reality

by John Harrison

This Saturday will mark a significant
step in establishing a women's health care
clinic in Grinnell, as the Women’s Health
Care Committee organizes a cleaning of
the future home of Gl'Innell's first
women's health care clinic. Advocates ofa
women‘s health center have worked many
years to establish a center to provide for
women's healthrcare needs, and their goal
is on the verge of being realized

Seniors Trudi witonsky and Leslie
Wilson for the last semester have been
organizing the etforts of Grinnell College
and the city of Grinnell to establish a
women‘s health care clinic that would
serve women from both the college and the
town. Wilson said. “We want a Clinic that
will help both students and town people,"

Wilson and witonsky said that they were
working with Central Iowa Family Plannr
ing Clinic, a non-profit private organiza
tion, to bring in a licensed gynecologist one
day per week to the clinic. Witonsky and
Wilson said that in addition to
gynecological exams, the clinic would also
distribute contraceptives and information
on tamiiy planning, Both witonsky and
Wilson were quick to point out that the
clinic would not perlorm abortions.

With assistance from Matt Hiissman of
the Grinnell Main Street program, Witonr
sky and Wilson were put in contact with
Grinnell landlords who were willing to ol~
fer building space at reduced cost. Witon-
sky said that Winston Hamilton of
llamiitoii Insurance oiiered oitice space at

live years, providing that the women‘s
health care center pays ior the renovation
oi the building. witonsky said, "We got a
