Our New Coach Returned.

Mr. R. L. Palmer, who so kind-
ly offered his services to our foot-
ball team for the past ten days or
so, has returned to his school work
at Princeton. He was certainly
loyal to his old school in volume
tecring his services for no renlu»
neration whatever. when very
lucrative positions were offered
him by various other schools for
the same kind of work. and Grin-
nell appreciates such a spirit and
exhibition of unselﬁsh friendship.

While the time was short for
any immediate'icsults to be ac»
complished, Mr. Palmer succeed-
ed in developing ideas about cer-
tain positions and plays, which is
hoped will bear fruit in the future.

One of Grinnell’s traditions is
that her system of playing is an
accumulation, so to speak of ex-
periences, and the good qualities
of our team are handed down to
succeeding teams. This is the
hope otthe management in regard
to "Einic's" coaching. We want
future teams to embody and de-
velope the low ideas he was able
to instill into the minds OI thc
present team during his brief stay
in Grinnell.

Hallowe’en Hop.

on Friday evening a gay throng
of young women assembled on
the door ot the Ladies’ Gymna-
sium, to celebrate Hallowe'en in
according to custom. with a hop.
No prettier party was ever held in
Grinnell. The happy faces of
the girls, the dainty evening
gowns, with music and ﬂowers,
remain a happy memory. al»
ways.

The piano was placed in the
center ot the ﬂoor. surrounded by
a mass of palmsunder whose shade
might be found a delightfully inn
viting cosy corner. The dear old

gotten and played its part in
decorating the gallery. Oriental
seats were profusely scattered
around the wall where weary
dancers might rest. Delicious
trappe was served all the evcning.

Promptly at eight o'clock dance
programs were handed around and
ajolly Five minutes was spent in
ﬁlling them out. "Do you lead?”
“Well I can ill have to." “May.
I have the ﬁrst extra then?”
might be heard on every side.
Miss Carlie Denise and Miss Ken'»
nedy led the grand march after
which the ﬁrst two step echoed
thro’ the room.

The ladies of the faculty and
the Professor’s ivivcs had been
invited who for the most part
came on the ﬂoor and danced with
as much enjoyment as the school
girls. The party was such a per-
fect success that every girl pres-
ent expressed a desire to have
the affair repeated during the
year. A neat sum of the proceeds
is to be given to the Athletic As-
sociation,

Eldora Game Cancelled.

The management is very sorry
to announce that the Eldora date
is cancelled. All arrangements
had been completed for playing
the gameat Eldora, and it was
fully expected and announced on
the schedule. The board of Con-
trol had sanctioned the game and
the management supposed of
course that this was sufﬁcient, but
it seems not. The faculty consid
ered the schedule, and much to
the surprise of the board and the
management failed to sanction
that one particular date. This is
a dissapointment to the second

team of course, as well as to the
managment. It is hoped, how-
ever, that another game can be
secured. though the season is
rather for advanced for making
new schedules.
