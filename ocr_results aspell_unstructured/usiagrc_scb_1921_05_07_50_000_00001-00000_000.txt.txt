Hobo's Hollow came to life last
night, and echoed and mediated with
the shouts of men and boys, and nor-

fire, as two hundred fathers and sons
of Grinnell, together with a. number
of college men, joined in a great
wienie roast that was staged by the
College Y. M. C. A. as the second step
in the local association‘s program of
Boys’ Recreational Work. The most
important feature of the program, of
course, was the eats, but there were
snappy talks and a general getting
acquainted. The idea was to get the
men of the city behind the work and,
judging from the noise and happy
confusion met surrounded the return
of the hikers, the affair was a great
success.

Next Saturday, the Association will
