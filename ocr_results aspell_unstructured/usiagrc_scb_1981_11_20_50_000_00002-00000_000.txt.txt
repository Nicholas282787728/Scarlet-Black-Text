Joint Board approves Rawe as SGA president

Drake authorizes Judicial Council for year

by Laura McDermiih

A motion was passed at Wednesday's
Joint Board meeting to approve Doug
Rowe as president or the SGA and to
validate all actions taken by Joint Board
with Doug Rowe as Chairman. A letter
from President George Drake which 31),
proved this year's Judicial Council was
also presented

The motion, “The Joint Board hereby
makes Doug Rowe the legal president or
the SGA for 1981'32 and confirms all his acV
lions as president oi SGA," was reached
alter a great deal of discussion about the
status of the entire Joint Board, The in-
titial problem was to determine which
members of the SGA are constitutionally
legal.

Earlier in the meeting, during his Stu-
dent Rules Committee report, Mark
Salmanson, chairman of that committee,
read a statement prepared Nov. 14 by the
SRC. Salmanson emphasized that the
recommendation was simply the opinion of

the SRC, which is empowered to recom-
mend interpretations or comment on the
constitution.

Because a new vote would involve a dif-
ierent voting population and would not be
valid under the constitution, the idea was
dismissed by the SRC as not feasible.
Rowe’s election was questioned because it
was held later than stipulated in the SGA
constitution, A

The recommendation of the SEC to the
Joint Board was to have Drake authorize
the Judicial Council and all of that
council's past and future actions, “I see
this as a technical but not a substantive
issue,” wrote Drake in his letter to the
SGA, and he did authonze the Judicial
Council as indicated by the SEC.

The Judicial Council, according to Arti-
cle ill, Section B, 5.5 f of the constitution,
"shall act as interpreters a] Constitutional ques~
nous which arise outstde 0/ Judicial Council

Hearings. In such cases, the College Judicial
Council, m consultation with the Dean of Slur
dent 14mins, shall have mot decision making
power. " The Joint Board, however, has no
speciiic power to interpret the constitu-
tion.

The recommended interpretation of U18
constitution by the SRC was challenged by
other Joint Baord members, SRC offered
that ii' Rowe was an illegally elected leader
of the SGA, the entire structure of the SGA
would be invalid. Dave Molho contended
that Joint Board was legal because it was
elected in accordance with the constitution
and the cabinet members were approved
by a legal Joint Board in keeping with the
constitution. \

It was then pointed out that Rowe's
presidency has not been legally challeng»
ed. Until legal action is taken, according to
Andy Cameron. administrative assistant,
the SGA has no legal responsibility to take

correcuve action, If Rowe’s presidency
was formally challenged, the issue would
go before the now legal Judicial Council to
be decided.

But, Molho said, “If we wait until
somebody brings it belore Judicial Coun-
cil, somebody may not and a lot of things
will Still be illegal," It was decided, then,
that a positive action be taken immediate
ly to rectify the situation. Molho suggested
that Teri Gould lake the chair and lead
Joint Board in a vote to approve oi Rowe
as president, Gould is technically the

legally elected vicepresident of the SGA

(according to Molho’s interpretation).

The motion to validate Rowe was Called
and passed. It Doug Rowe's presidency is
formally questioned, the validity oi some
other SGA members are also in question.
In this case, the issue would go to the
Judicial Council. Until then, Rowe is the
valid confirmed president oi SGA.

Discrimination, handicapped policies revised
GCGC complains campus community not properly notified

by Anne Rawland

Al the beginning of this semester thECol~
lege took a progressive step by revising its
non-discrimination and handicapped
policies. However, one campus organiza-
tion complained recently that the college
fell short ot its responsibility to properly
notify the campus community,

The new NonrDiscrlmination Policy
speciiically states the college's commit-
ment to nondiscrimination according to
“sexual or ailectional preference._" Also,
as part or the review oi the college's new
handicapped facilities, the Kansas city
civil rights oiiice required the college to
expand and state specifically Grinnell's 0f-
licial policy concerning the handicapped.
Both policies went into eiiect Sept. to.

Last week Bob Dorsett, Coordinator of

Video machines for Younker vetoed

the Grinnell College Gay Community
tGCGC), inlormed the 5&3 oi the Non
Discrimination Policy change. He noted
the college had posted some “green signs"
in various places around campus which
stated both policies. But no official notice
went out to the community. None of the
notices appeared in the dorms nor do the
signs point out that the policies have been
revised.

“It's done but nobody knows," said
Dorsett oi the policy changes. “We ieel
that the campus should be aware ot the
amendment to the NonrDiscrimination
Policy because it is important that the col-
lege has made this commitment to in
dividual rights." He continued, “It's not as
effective if the Grinnell College communi»

ty is unaware ot the policy's existence."

When asked why the college failed to
properly disseminate the mlormation,
William Deminoff answered, “It should
have been.” Deminofi, who serves as
director of College Relations, special
assistant to the president, affirmative ac-
tion officer and lecturer, went on to say, ”i
guess i have been remiss as affirmative
action coordinator.”

In order to rectify the situation Deminofl
said, “We'll probably put it in [the] Memo
and make it clear that it's a new policy."
He also noted the new policies have
already been distributed to ﬁle Admissions
and Finanaal Aid office and will appear in
all campus publications as subsequent
printing: occur.

The GCGC rirst approached Deminoff
last rail with the suggestion for revising
the nondiscrimination policy, At that time
Deminoff told them he telt sexual
preferenCe was included under “sex"
which already appeared in the policy.
“They wrote back making a very good
Case for it ta sexual preierence clausel,"
Deminoii said.

Dorsett noted the GCGC began talking
about the issues as iar back as the [all or
1979. “We don't think the college has been
discriminating, we just wanted to get It in
writing because in the iuture the ad-
ministration might not be run by such
enlightened individuals," he said

“We worked so hard," said Dorselt. ”It
was just kind or antirclimatic."

Liability, noise, “mindlessness” cited by Joint Board members

Although approximately 60 percent or
the students who responded to a Student
‘Rules Committee poll conducted alter fall
break were interested in having Video
machines installed in a residence hall
lounge, SGA voted at the Joint Board
meeting Wednesday not to install the
games.

Residents of Younker Hall voted Nov. 11
to have video machines installed in their
lounge if all residence halls would be able
to receive a percentage of the iunds cola
lected through an all-campus hall fund.
This revenue for Younker and the other
halls was approved by the SGA as an
amendment but the bill to install the‘
machine did not pass. Main Hall restdents
voted earlier not to have any machines in-
stalled in Gardener Lounge.

The mam reason for vetoing the
machines was the (act that SGA would
have to assume a $3,000 to $5,000 liability
on them. SGA members also pointed out
that Video and pinball machines are
available in the Forum, which, being a
controlled area, does not have problems

with noise or damage that machines in a
residence hall lounge might create.

Oticampus noncollege owned represen
tative Eric Johnson protested the installa-
tion of machines and called them
“mindless," He and other board members!
felt it is not SGA's function to provide such
entertainment, Several Younker residents
at the meeting also voiced concern about
added noise which would result from in
creased traffic through the dorm.

The idea oi putting video or pinball
machines in residence halls was founded
by Younker Hall President Bill Me
Cullough. McCullough originally wanted to
install a video machine in his own room
but was told by Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Tederman that only SGA can have
machines installed McCullough then pur-
sued the idea by having his game proposal

.put on a questionnaire that was distributed

campus-wide over break. McCullough
hoped that SGA would agree to put in the
machines after student support was shown
through the questionnaire.
