WAR PUTS BAN UN UBATUHIU

Inability to Purchase Bucks Makes
Appearance (II Iiiitirc Organ
tiou Impossible.

An unexpected result of war condi-
tions is the ahsenee from the May Fes~
’ttval program, for the first time in
seventeen years, oi the Grinnell Ora.-
torio Society. It was expected that
the Oratorio Society would ﬁll its sic»
custoinetl place in the present Festi
val. but it was discovered that there
were not sumcient copies in this
count oi any appropriate choral
work. e ept those that have recently
heen given here, to supply the So-
ciety, and none could be imported on
account of embal'goes against paper
and books. It was with no little dilu-
culty that enough copies oi: “Paradise
and the Peri” were located to supply
only the College Choir. _

Orchestral programs also feel the
etfeet of the emhargo. and practically
no new music is Coming from abroad.
its practically all orchestial music is
published abroad, the only material
available for orchestral periormance
consists of what was in the country
hetore the war. In view of this fact
the programs which Mr. onerhoifcr is
to present Monday are extremely vzk
ried, and contain as much in the way
of novelty as would he possible under
normal conditions.

WIRELESS IS DISMANILEU

Local Station [5 Taken Down Al-
though its Yet N0 Orders Have
Been Received.

The wireless station in Goodnow‘
Hall is now completely dismantled.i
The worl: ot dismantling was begun
ahnut ten days ago, and was com-
pletely ﬁnished up last Friday.

The Grinnell station was not di5e
mantled because of government
orders, as no orders to that eifeet
have been received up to the present
time. This, is prohahly due to the
feet that this station is a compara-
tively new one and had not yet heen
registered with the government, since
all registered stations were given
orders to dismantle some time ago
The government took over for its own
use a few of the largest stations, such
as those at Amos and Iowa City. and
ordered the others to be mkeu down.
In view of these facts it was thought
host to dismantle the Grinnell station
without waiting ior special orders
from the government.

However. this will not affect the
work ot the wireless class which Prof.
Floyd Taylor, instructor in physics.
has organized, as it is not necessary
to have the station in operation to
learn the principles and code of the
wireless system

Even hreah.

I wish I was a reek,
A settin’ an a. hill,
A doin' nothin’ all day ions
But just a settin' still.
I wouldn't sleep; I wouldn't eat;
I wouldn't even wash;
I'd just sit. still it thousand years
And rest myselt, by goshE7Ex.
