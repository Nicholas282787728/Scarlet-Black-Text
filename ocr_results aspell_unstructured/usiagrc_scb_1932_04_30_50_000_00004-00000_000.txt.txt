Super sion of “Ossie” Solem, former head football
coach flt Drake, and now grid mentor at the Uni-
versity of Iowa, for the, lust time.

I the} 'e successful, Solcm should get: double
credit for lcllim'ing zln almost impossible task, that
of being two‘ places at almost: the Sallie llmeitll—
resting spring grid practice at Iowa City. and per-
sonally conducting advance rcloy activities ill Des
Moillcs.

Coach Solem, in the several years he was at
the llulLdog school, built up the prestige of the
Drake relays from that of a more or less unimporte
:lnt meet to one which is now one of the most out»
standing tl‘ock sessions in the country.

Whether or not those who succeed Sell-m will
be able to retain that prestige, remains to be seen
in coming years.

EARNING HIS WAY

Competition for college jobs, as Well as for
those owrly from the academic atmosphere is be—
coming kcener. More and more students are finding
it llccessa to earn all or part of their expenses.
Others, lv h whom a job is not on absolute necess—
ity, are following suit ill applying for work.

Ill a certain homr, let us imagine, the head of
the family iS becoming fl trifle pressed for fllnd
He has sold one, of l s cars and has reduced ll .'
office staff. Per-hops HS wife has decided that She
must stop playing bridge for such high stakes and
has let Lena, the maid, go. In order to further this
cconnllly, the pair has the brilliant idea that Junior
while attending college, might help out by earn-
ing port of his expenses.

This is all very Well if Junior does not Apply
for 4 common obor job which dozens of other stun
dents actual in need. are able to handle as well
or better than he. Of Course, if he has o peculiar
talent for some particular phase of work and can
do the “(tilt better than the next mail. col-thinly he
should be considered. This is not often the case,
however.

NOT SO BAD
(From the Marquette 'i’i-ibiuicl

- graduation rapidly draws nearer. those who are
to receive the coveted diploma naturally Lake a. more
than pas lug, interest in the present economic condition.
General reports seem to indicate that business in gene
eiiil ls slowly improving and conditions are tending to-
\l“ rd a more normal level. While many graduates who
will enter the vnrions business fields in June ole bitterly
commenting upon the fact that they are going forth to
make a living at an inopportune time, the facts in the

case do not warrant this assumption.

The senior is entering his life's work at a time when
business is growing. He has an opportunity to observe
the various means which manufacturers, publishers and
merchants are using to build their business to a pro»
depression level. Because prices are lower than ever be»
fore, he can. with a small amount of capital. build a
business of his own and reap the gain to follow from
his enterprise,

He has had an opportunity to observe the mistakes
of others and benefit from them. In short, while capital
is scarce, the opportunity to build on his own endeavors
is greater than it has been in years and the results
depend almost entirely upon his own initiative. He also
has the advantage of youth and the hope and Courage
which go with it. The men who will he graduated in
June are not to be pitierl but rather envied for the busi-
ness and professional opportunities which are theirs for
the taking.

NEEDEDiANOTHER REQUIREMENT
(From the Oberlin Review)

Those who graduate from a college of Arts and
Sciences go out into the world patting themselves on
the back and saying to themselves that: they have re-
ceived 2L liberal education. Many of them, however, have
not, had enough of the right kind of learning to be
worthy of the title of "Citizen of the United States."

At election time they join those who cast, their
votes for corruptors of government, for men who use
taxpayers money for their own use, for men who em—
ploy all the tricks so well known to politicians. They
help prolong the reign of grafters who hold thousands
at their mercy, and who grasp in their iron hands any
who would dare try to escape. They encourage the
regime of bosses who hold a lash above their hundreds
of puppets scampering about to cheat, lie, and bribe
for votes. They disregard, discourage, and, in the end,
scorn the work of conscious investigation commissions,
because they possess not a. single clear idea of what
government is all about.

A liberal estimate of the number of undergraduates
who understand what is going on in the world, would be
one i. nth of the student body. It is unfair. however,
to cri cize students for not reading extensively the best
current political writings. After all, with Work piled on
the desk in front of him, anyone would feel it fomish
to begin some outside study. The best way to create
interest. in government is to require students to do a
little Concentrated work in study in that field.

To see that: a knowledge of What is happening right.
now is as important to a liberal education as a know-
ledge of what has happened in the past; and hence to
require that all who Wish to be well educated learn
something of their own government—this is to raise
the standards of government in the United States. This
is to send people into the world of politics who will
be assets to the Country, and who will thus be worthy
to be called useful citizens of the United States.

INSTEAD OF BARBARIC REVOLUTION
(From Southern California Daily Trojan)

What to do and what not to do With this thing called
Manithis beast with certain inhibitions.

For the moment let us forget the absurd idealism
and damnable pragmatism of the so alled minority
which is responsible for our public opinion. Let us, in-
stead, seek a “way out.” of our present political and
economic difficulties.

In Russia we see a system of state planning (State
Socialisml as the fundamental element in the successes
of the Soviet republics. But in the actual working out
of the planning we find, theoretically at least, Como
munism.

As we all know, Russia. is discarding the principles
of extreme Communism for a modified and controlled

'capitalism. In other words, the Communists realize that

they must give due compensation to the worker if they
are to hope for fulfillment of their plans.

This type of financial set-up might readily be termed
a benevolent capitalism.

Here in the United States we face a drastic change
in our economic system. We know full well that we can
produce far beyond our present rate of consumption,
and, unlike the Russians, our problem is one of con-
sumption rather than one of production.

Russia gained freedom as a result of her revolution.
but she still lacks the liberties of the Americans. Here
in the United States we have our liberties (such as they
are}. but our economic structure destroys the essential
elements of freedom.

At first thought we might say that freedom, as an
essential element in any entity, is confined to the role
atively new state. But we can well see that lack of free—
dom is due to poor and inadequate social and economic
lnsthulZans,

Rather than advance the immature and barbarian
policy of the Russians in precipitating change, it fol-
lows tliat we must take advantage of our superior posi-
tion. We have agencies, such as they are, which if well
directed, can bring to us the desired economic and par
litical changes.

Right now we have many well supported groups that
need only leaders. The mass of people in this country
seem to lack only this to advance the best interests of
the people.

Instead of the childlike revolution of the Russian
Communists. we advance the product of their experi»
ment. Everyone will agree that we must have state plan.
ning.

A benevolent capitalism seems to be the only sys-
tem desirable and in the least bit probable in this coun-
try. Should we not give everyone his just compensation,
thereby increasing both production and consumption, as
well as the best interests of both the country and peo-
ple 7

Students have made approximately
