professional composer because later on,
you will work directly with them,” said
Erin McBurney '09.

The project has been proceeds
ing steadily. Starting last semester, the
Singers have met three times a week
for hour and a half rehearsals. After

befall: Grinnell productions. No F/rrdway depression
allowed to kill thejoy of ﬁin costumes here.

In Scene Three, lingering gloom evaporates into
the sparkling glamour orlerry Herman’s Hr”, Dal/y.
Mitchell morphs into a fast-stepping eight-year-old
with a digniﬁed profile that melts into a panicky little
boy face as he sings the line, “the pier is not advancing"
followed by the group song “Did 1 Put out Enough?”
in mockery of the over-the-top musical silliness and
superﬁciality. Grinnellians who are still waiting to
understand the sophisticated humor of Mitingfar

Godot, will ﬁnally have their chance to laugh.

pour in scene 4 and we're in Andrew Lloyd Webber's
P/Jmitam oft/M 0pm and giggling at one of the best
songs of the musical, “We Never Talk Anymore" is
Mitchell nnd Mcscon srruggle no stop singing. They
ask, “What’s it all for? I can’t understand what you're
saying. We never talk anymore!" Their commurucs-
tion difﬁculties across musical and gender boundaries
prove more entertaining than squabblcs among Con

renditions can give the Grinnell singers stuffy vocal
performances a run for their money.

In traditional Grinnell fashion, the evening per
formance ends with ii final scene featuring sex and
debauchery, in this case digniﬁed by the parody of
Kander and Ebb's Cbimge. “All That Jazz" accompa-

nies Mitchell’s transformation from gay prison in»
mate singing "Color Me Gay" to flirty female cabaret
dancer performing on a chair while batting his and
lnrcr, her, eyelashes furiously and flashing n demonic
smile.

Seniors will appreciate this final sexy musical
scene after yerrs ofhcaring about rhc hugely success—
ful 2001 producrion of Cabaret, directed by Pip Gore
don, Theatre. That was, of course, before the musical
crackdown that put the kibosh on all the non-abstruse,
non-academic productions that were deemed too
enjoyable for serious theatre. Though I’m sure even
those who decided Grinnell is too good for musicals
will blush when Mitchell winks at them and watch
enviously as seniors trail after him to 100 Days.
