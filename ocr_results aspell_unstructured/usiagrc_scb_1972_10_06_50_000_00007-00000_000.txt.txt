Iowa River Proves Cancer’s Challenge

by Brent Schondeimever

We stood posed on the bridge with
binoculars raised to anxious eyes,
peering up and down the meandering
Iowa River on its way to the Mississe
ippi. We were on our way back to
Griuncll with the exception that we
were missing one canoe, it was like

the old WW ll airfield with the brass

looking on waiting tor the last plane
to come in, yet knowing not it it
would.

The occasion was the SRA’S over—
night canoe trip on the lowa River.
According to The iowa Conserva-
tionist "throughout most ofits length
the lowa River is a typical prairie
stream." Such was not the case for
our trip irom Eagle City to Eldora.

Finding Eagle City was in itseii
a tiisk, but the eagle in front of the
single dwelling should have beena
clue. The campgrounds iouuti many
campers already cooking supper and
they invited us down laterthat even-
to share their camptire, guitar and
array oi homemade wines that kept
the body warm on cold nights.

Early the next morning, with padr
tiles in hand, the Grinnell armada
was launched downstream on a long
and hazardous journey, Around the
first bend a wire was stretched a-
cross the width of the river--chest
high. It would pose no problem if
somebody would iust raiseit enough
so that the Canoe could go under
neath. At least until someone dis-
covered that the hand conducts elec
tricity as well as wire, especially
when Wet,

Later another wire was found and
trom previous experience thepower
box was located and turned off. It
was supposed to be a cow stopper.
As far as we were concerned the

cows could march on San Fran-
sisco, but the canoes must go on.

What followed was an endless Con—
tinuation of stroke on stroke accome
panied by an ever changing scenery
and sore shoulders.

A dam at Steamboat Rock require
that we portage the canoes orgoover
a 9 root drop which might have con-
clu‘u‘ed‘our trip rath‘er prematurely.

Agriculture Earl) Butz.“ Schwengel
says “every place outside oia coi-
iege campus” that the Adminis-
tration is “doing a fantastic job.”

As an example, Mezvinsky noted
that Schwengel “had Butz as his
spokesman at BurlingtonwhereButz
said he didn’t see where there was
anything wrong with this wheat
deal.” Earlier in the day before a
Political Science Clziss Mezvinsky
commented on the recent sale of
Wheat to the Soviet Union, and Said
that “the theory of supply and de
mand was definitely stackedinlavor
of the American wheat farmers.
But the USDA was able to turn the
Odds around and give the advane
tage to Us grain dealers and Sov-
ietwheatbuyers.”

“The USDA's inept handling of the
situation,” he said, “has already
cost our treasury more than $100
million.”

Mezvinsky told the $813 that the
Secretary oiAgriculturerepresents
a kind oi philosophy that tarmers

shouldn‘t tolerate: a kind of “adapt
or die" philosophy. According to

Mczvinsky Butz is “serving ohepurv

for tlle reelection of the President.

An SRC canoe trip provided the opportunity for two Grinnellians to try
their hand (paddle?) at a little whitewater canoeing.

At long last we reached our lies»
tination, '7 miles below the dam
and a long 18 irom Eagle City
There was a turbulent rapid that no
one could navigate on the iirst
try and which provided a challenge
tor those reckless enough to shoot
the rapids again, to prove they
could,

The canoes Came in about every
haii hour. Three, tour, five, . . .
Could they have ripped a hole in
the canoe or the cows give them
trouble upstream? it was two hours
since the last canoe had come in,

We contacted the park ranger who
knew nothing concerning the canoe,
but at our urging contacted the El~
dora sherrif’s ofiice.

“Do you know anything concerning
two canoeists 0n the Iowa River?”

“Tenrfour They pulled theircanoe
out at Steamboat Rock and hitched
back to Grinnell?”

We were taken aback till in due
time the story became clear The

caused chaos, a tremendous amount
of confusion" and he iurthercharged
that they “have not been applied
fairly across tliebohrd." Mezvinsky
supports the position of former
Johnson adviser Walter Heller, who
suggests that the Administration use
“voluntary constraints, target in on
those groups that are causing the
inﬂation, and put the pressure on
them.”

Had the Congress passed the Tax‘

Reform Act 0! 1972,Mezvinskysaid,
“you could bring into the State of
Iowa about ZlS million dollars. Here
in Poweshiek county you could
reduce the property taxes as much
as 30 percent ”

Mezvinsky believes that because
the First District has been l'edis-
tricted since the lastelectionhenow
has an excellent chance oi defeating
Schwengel “l have more colleges
per capita in my district than in
any district in the Midwest," he
noted. “I have it median age below
thirty. Without question this is going
to make a difference.”

What would be the difference bet
ween Mezvinsky and Schwengcl ii
the war were not an issue? “The
difference,” he said, “is primarily
one or outlook I view my role
differently "

“I thinkasaCongressm’anl shouldr

two "missing canoeists” thought
that we were the missing ones
thinking that the dam was the fins
ishing point. Certain that they had
been left behind, they were further
assured of the fact when the mayor’s
wife of steamboat Rock drove them
up and down the river linding nay
a Grinnellizin On ti call to the Cole
lege the two canoeists were told
to leave the canoe at the lady's
house and hitch back to Grinnell.
The college then in turnrgot the
information to the shel‘riff’s office.
Meanwhile the mayor’s wile ied the
two and drove them to Marshalltown
where they hitched on home, while
on the banks of the Iowa River the
rest of the Grinnell contingent Sat
Confused by this intentional act of
irresponsibility only to realize later
that there is a little more to river
navigation than iust heading down
stream. .and, at the same time
experiencing the, reliei ielt when one
of the lost flock has been found

or others come up to me and pe~
tition me tor particular programs.
I think what I should do is come in
and say -Looke~these programs are
available, This particular bill is
going to come up regarding the war
in Vietnam. instead olnlwcys waite
ing to repair the damage I think
that you’re going to have to initiate
action, and I think that IS really
what a lot or students are saying

now,

“Those in oiiice stay in otiice,
they play the game, they have their
pictures taken on the Capitol steps,
they send the pictures out, and then
we don’t receive the benefits."

YOUTH FARES TO 60??

Special reduced “youth fares” on the nation’s airlines appear to be on
the way out, according to inicrniation received this week train the Con
tinentai Marketing Corporation.

a Civil Aeronautics Board Examiner ruled iour years ago that such
iares were “unjustly discriminatory” because age alone is not a valid
diiierence between passengers, Sackioads oi rnail opposing the decision
caused the CAB to reverse its decision.

Since that time, a tour year study oi youth iares has been conducted
to determine whether the reduced iares are reasonable, A decision was

slated to have been announced in August, but has been delayed, reportedly
until after the November elections.

Sources quoted by Continental Marketing concur that chances are bleak
that reduced youth fares will continue.
