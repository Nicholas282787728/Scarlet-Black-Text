Letters from the Old World:
Part I - The Arrival

By Riva Sharples

 

 

fellow Grinnellians Matt McKinney and Gwen Costa, are fighting torrential rains, gusty Winds, and

the chore Ofassimilating into a new culture. I have been in England for four weeks now, and, putting
culture shock,jct lag, and confusion aside, I am having a good time. I escaped out ofthe Midweston January
2 just before the cold weather arrived. On January 5, I an-ived in Lancaster, England, where I am studying for
a semester, via a detour in Liverpool to see beloved Beatles sights.

Liverpool was fantastic. Though native Brits speak of it as a dirty and run-down city to be avoided, it
seemed to have a charm and character about it absent in other English cities I’ve seen. Perhaps that was due
to the fact that the sun was shining (a rare occurrence) or that i am a Beatles nut. I walked down Penny Lane
(where the street sign had to be painted onto a stone hedge because so many people had stolen the usual metal
si gns),clun g to the gate ofStrawbcrry Fields (thesidewalk was {rightfully narrow thereand lite streetittcredibly
busy. And then our tour guide had the audacity to tell us that one Beatles fan had already been injured there
by the crazy British trafﬁc), and gazed at the birthplaces of John, George, Paul, and Ringo. Strolling down
Matthew Street, home of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles played 292 performances and were “discovered"
by Brian Epstein, I found the world’s largest Beatles memorabilia shop that even carried life»size blow up
balloons of the fab four.

After Liverpool, my arrival at Lancaster was of course a letdown, Aside from about70 other Americans,
it was very quiet at Lancaster University when I arrived The university is very large, and I have the luck of
living in the southem»most dorm on campus. There are nine pubs, two groceriesand several other smaller stores
within campusr Some of the pubs open around noon, and all are open by 8:00 pm, at night Beer, and strong
beer at that, is the drink of preference here. Most people consume it in pint-size glasses.

Nightlife here is much different than at Grinnell. Because Lancaster is considered what we would call a
“suitcase” school (students travel home on the weekends), people party on weeknights and nothing really
happens on Saturday nights. Sunday and Wednesday nights are big. A normal night out on the town begins
around 7:00 pm. with fish and chips and then drinks at a pub, When the pub closes at 10:30 pm, people who
were lucky enough to get a ticket (you have to stand in line for an hour or more to buy a bus ticket) trek out to
the nightclubs. Wednesday nights it‘s the Empire in Moreeambe and Monday night its Brooks or a trip to
Manchester orLiverpooI fordisco dancing. Songs thatmake the house go wild here are “YMCA" and“Dancing
Queen" by ABBA.

Lancaster University is actually located three miles south of the town of Lancaster. The town is historic,
with relics of the medieval ages still kicking around. A castle, once used for tenure and confmemenl, looms
above the city and is still used today as a prison Down in the market area, there are cobblestone streets closed
to traffic and sports a pub every few feet. Some of the best are the Blue Anchor, the Slip Inn, and the Stonewall
Tavern. Eariy bird “tea” specials featured at the pubs (served from 7:00 pm. on) include steak and kidney pies
and fish and chips

Lancaster is located about four miles from the western coast of nonhem England. The weather is mild (no
snow), but it tends to be rainy and misty nearly every days And when the wind gusts up from the coast, it feels
as bad as any blizzard in Iowa. Rolling hills of green surround the colleges The grass is so wet that it sounds
soggy and one sinks deep into the muck, Of course, as I was told, only an American would try to walk through
the grass!

England is much like the United States, but it is all ofthe little differences that make itchallenging and fun
(and sometimes stressful and fnisuating) to bean American studying here. For example, doors here push rather
than pull, and you can tell a new American, they say, by the way they run into the doors. Pizza doesn 1 come
sliced when delivered. It‘s “give way,” not yield.“ And everybody over 40 seems to call me “love,"

Next week, we travel into the depths of the English countryside surrounding Lancaster. Until then, stay warm.
