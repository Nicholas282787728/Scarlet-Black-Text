Editor’s Note. . The G. 1. General,
who usually wrote this column
from his cave in Cowles Hall, was
found this morning with a knife
in his back. All persons he miss
represented in his column are be-
ing held as suspects. Here are
some of the more important
quotes from the star witnesses. . ,
Harrier Cooke—“After what he
did to me, he's lucky I didn't get
a hold of him.” Trainee Gidltcyi
"It’s not true He can't rcsigii.
That guy practically married me."
. , . . But no matter what the
suspects say, the General is dead.
For today's paper, ”Four Roses"
Borgens has gathered together the
following dirt.

Trainee Bob “Forget Me Not"
Maxwell is an inspiration to all
participants in Monday's sosslollsl
of calisthenics. His secret? He‘
spends his entire week-end in dil-l
ligent preparation. l

Trainee Tom Hunter, otherwise
known as “I wanna go to charm
school" Hunter, finds his person-
ality beginning to protrude in all
directions since he quit passing up
“Seconds.” “Would elastic buttons
help?"

Trainee “Tanglefoot” cavaliere
has received his treasured hockey
skates and is now awaiting the
first freeze. "Are there any hockr
ey players in Grinnell."

Trainee Scafa has made a firm
resolution to ask _the swimming
coach for a towel from now on.
Scafa wandered off on a foraging
expedition on his own iniative af-
ter coming out of the pool and
he was mighty embarrassed. By
the way, Seats is highly insulted
when he is called “One Tori . He
asserts that he is closer to “Two
Tons."

Trainee “Molasses" Gidneycaiﬁe
within five seconds of setting a
new record for the obstacle course.
If he hadn't been pried out of the
drain pipe he'd have set a record
that even a Basic Engineer would
envy.

Trainee “Sick can" Noke’s splrr'

monger's report on current acLin
ities at the Quad.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor;

Enclosed is a copy of the letter-
which I am going to send to
President Roosevelt after all those
who Wish to sign it have had a
chance to do so. I shall probably
bring it to house meetings for.
signature , and i shall find sonic
way at reaching the students who
are interested.

Since several facility members
have spoken to me about the let-
ter. it may he that mole of them
will want to sign it.

Dear Mr, President.

The immediate occasion for
this letter is the Courlrlnartlal
of Sgt. Alton Levy at Lincoln'
airfield, but we wlshqilso to
bring to your attention other in.
stances of unjust treatment oi
negroes in the armed forces of
the United States.

Knowmg your attitude on the
subject of racial prejudice, we

are sure you were pained to learn

that at Sheiiango, Pa. a negro‘
was killed and Six negroes
wounded in a clash between
black and white soldiers The
action of Col, Coleman at self»
ridge Eield, Mich., was disgrace
ful enough, but the leniency at
his punishment must not be du-
plicated. Most recently Sgt.
Levy has been court-martialed
for protesting against what
seemed to him unfair treatment
of negroes, As far as we can
discover, Sgt. Levy did not exei
ceed the privileges granted him
as a member of a military or-
ganization.

A liberal arts college teaches
respect for justice and a belief
in the rights of the individual.
We urge you to use your offi-
cial power as a weapon against}
the myth of race supremacy. for
we believe that the United
states, a powerful member of
the United Nations, must prac»‘
tice tolerance in domestic as
well as in foreign affairs.
