A Triple Standard .7 .7 ?

The shiny new drinking rule seems to be getting a
little tarnished. It’s funny, too, because sterling is supposed

to improve with use. Maybe

we got fooled and it’s only

silver plated. The joint League Board and C of HP drink-
ing policy announced the first week of school stated that
disorderly conduct on college property resulting from intox-
ication is prohibited. The following penalties may be in—
flicted in 'such cases: first violation: suspension from the
college for one week; second violation: suspension from the
college for two weeks; third and/or succeeding violations:
a longer period of suspension to be recommended at the dis-
cretion of the Council of House Presidents and/or the Lea—

gue Board,

This week a Langan freshman and a Dibble sophomore
were campused through November 6 for disorderly con~
duct. Yet a Read senior was suspended for one week due to
disorderly conduct. What is the reasoning behind this dis-
crepancy? Could it be that the governing bodies concerned
are going under the assumption that discretion and age
are proportionate? If so, we hasten to remind the League
Board and C of HP that the state of lowa doesn’t think so;
at least the drinking laws don’t indicate it: It doesn’t seem
to make much difference to the Iowa legislature whether

you are a freshman or senior

standard? It seems like there should be some uniformity
in dlscipline between town and gown. We’re not suggesting
that the C of HP jail people or that the police campus them,
but we are suggesting that the C of HP, League Board and
Grinnell police get together on this and come up with a

single standard.

To The Editor:

As 1 was thumbing through s
nationally syndicated magazine
the other day l happened to
notice an article praising the
town of Grinnell as being one
of few places in lhc country
that still‘ serves the nickle cup
of coffee. Pleased at the thought
of living in a town that has a
reputation for low prices in to-
day‘s inﬂation l trotted to the
Union, ordered a cup of coffee,
plunked down my nicklc, and
was told very matter of factly
it was seven cents.

Now just think here at the
College we have all the bene-
fits of Flu shots, Buddy Mor-
row, Cocd eating and the likcs,
and the small lown of Grinnell
achieves its fame by just serv-
ing a cheap cup of Coffee. While

the ever crowded Pioneer Grill
of the oldest collcgc west of the
Mississippi is one of the few
places in town where coffee is
expensive.

I don’t claim to be a great
authority, but it appears to me
by way of observation that just
as much coffee is sold in the
Union as is sold in s restauv
rant in town. not to mention all
the extra fountain products. No
longer can the college students
brag of their great advantages,
the businessmen of Grinnell
have given us a lesson in Eco
noinics. With s nicklc cokc in
my hand (which is next to go)
i am,

Mr, Robert roll, of Fremont,
Iowa, is an alumnus who takes
a more than average lnterest in
the school and in this paper.
He also shows an interest in lhls
column, as he was one of the
originators of the thing which
appeared in this space thirty
years ago. Mr. Fell has recenlly
written a letter to Old Tom
protesting (mildly) the constant
changes of name for the column,
so we’re obliging by changing it
again.

Thirty years ago, and for
some sgcs after, it was known
as The Doric—a Column of
Pure Beauty. We'll change chc

Speaking of alumni, ,a fairly
quiet Homecoming seems to be
over. Looking into the iulurc, it
leads one to think that even the

Architectural Style

Perhaps the strongest person-
ality in the entire show is re
flected in the paintings of Karl
Mattern, particularly his oil
Snow and Colder. Mattern deftly
builds his composition upon an
architectonic structure much as
an architect wields iron and
steel to create a monument of
strength and durability. Form,
space and color are literally
welded into place in such a
Way as to project a singular ex
perience One finds no fumbling
hEreionly confidence.

Wallace Green’s prismatic oil
Angel and the Cows is delight
ful, but more compelling are the
rich tonalities of his sculpture
Annunciation which seems to
radiate an inner glow of dedls
cation and humility.

On the whole the show is a
colorful one.

”Morrow Disappoin'l'SVA-lldience

Band Members Lack-Inieresl’

by Jim Wohlnci-

The Buddy Morrow concert
presented Wednesday night in
the high School. auditorium
proved quite disappointing, The
audience came to the affair lex-
peccing a great deal more than
they rcccived. Morrow's group
was presented before an audi-
ence that, at first, was highly
appreciative, but obviously the
boys were not knocking them-
selves out.

Perhaps the reason for this
fiasco was the fact that the
band did not seem to care about
what they were doing. If the
musicians themselves are not
interested in their work, they
can hardly expect their,audience
to become enthusiastic,

Mr. Morrow's success can be
attributed to his recording of
“Night Train" which was and
is a worthwhile effort, but with
a few exceptions every number
presented by the band seemed
to be another ”Night Train"
played inside out or upsidc
down. The arrangements lacked
color and luster. Improvisation
on harmony, rhythm. as well as
melody was lost. All creativity
that might have come from in-
dividual sales was submerged
by Morrow’s blaring trombone,

The vocalists, Dorothy Roe
and Jerry Mercer, could just as
well have stayed home for what
they added to the lackluster
program. However the audience
did seem pleased with Mercer’s
offering of “I Don't Know" and
drew a hearty laugh with his
impression of (he Ink Spots.

There were one or two other
moments of brightness in the
sad affair when Stan Edson
displayed a Very lyrical and
melodic tenor sax with his in~
terpretaiion of “Tenderly.” The
piano of Buddy Freed was be
yond reproach in his brief ap-
pearance with the jazz quartet
on “S‘Wonderful” but he found
it quite difficult to wrest the

spotlight from Morrow.

The septet that disinterested»
1y attempted “Saints" could
hardly be known as advocaccs
of Dixieland music. The sups
posed spontaneous and unre-
llearsed aggregation that offer-
ed “Perditio” ran around in cir-
cles.

On the whole the group had
nothing to say and expressed
just that much. One thing can
be said for the Buddy Morrow
concert, it was loud. ﬂ
