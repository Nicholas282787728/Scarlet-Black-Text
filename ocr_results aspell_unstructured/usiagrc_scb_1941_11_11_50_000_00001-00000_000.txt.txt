Cale Sees Plane
‘Theft’ Saturday
As Foul Play

By Allen Arncy
Foul play is suspected by Grant
0. Cale, C. A. A. adviser, in the
removal of an airplane skeleton
from the basement of Goodnow
hall to the front of the library
Saturday night.

The airplane could not have
gotten over to thehbrory by itself,
helicvcs Gale, who is a physics
professor and therefore well-vers-
ed in such subjects.

Furthermore, the transportation
experts, probably part of a ‘Hell
Week’ crew, will pay the costs in-
curred in returning the (lo-winged
bird to its nest, Gale claimed.

"We're sending them the labor
hill we had to pay to get it
back,” Gale claimed.

The culprits are not yet known,
Gale admitted, but he felt confi»
dent, that they, whoever ‘they’ are
would get the bill.

Grinnell, it was shown at the Iliu—
versity of Iowa and at Iowa State

becca L. Bryant, hostess in Mears
cottage.

Mrs. Bryant has been acting as
an art assistant during Miss Edith
A. Stemfeld’s absence.

No admission price is asked, and
friends of the college are especial—
ly invited to come and see the ex»
hibit, Mrs. Bryant said.

Everion Tells
Religion Policy

Defines Obieciives
of Church Program
In Chapel Address

"Our campus religious program is
not meant to compete in any way
with the work of the local chur<
ches.”

Dr. John Scott Evcrton, dean of
the college chapel, particularly
emphasized this in his ‘address to
leaders and laymen of the Iowa
Congregational Church conference
Tuesday morning.

Dr. Everton went on to tell
that "the main objective of the
newly fonncd' Board of Religion
is to make religion a vital factor
in the college experience of each
student".

The Board,.composed of nine
students, represents a cruss»sec-
tion of student life, he said. These
students have complete charge of
chapel programs and they also
sponsor a college social service
program.

“The Board seeks to supplement
the work or local agencies and
the individual projects undertaken
by the local churches, rather than
to compete with them in this
field", Dr. Everton said.

God Is Like Man’s Most Perfect
Conception of Himself Says Bell

“God is like Jesus."

The Christian conviction of God
was thus explained by Dr, Ber-
nard Iddings Bell, Gates Memorial
Lecturer for 1941, in his lecture
entitled "or God" Tuesday eve-
ning in Herrick chapel. It was
the second of the series of Gates
Lectures this year,

Since God is like man, he must
he like man’s most perfect con-
ception of himself. Dr, Ben says
such a man is one who loves
without demanding love.

God revealed himself in Jesus
Christ when the people's under-
standing ot Him had reached this
point, he believes.

The Episcopalian minister p0int<
ed out why God is like man by
expressing the belief that God is
the mystery behind all things.
Man is the most complex living
thing and can only think in terms
of his own experience, he said.

This phase of understanding
has developed through two other
stages. The first being the stage

of savage worship of idols in
the form of sticks and stones be-
cause they contained some
mysterious element inconceivable
to the simple savage mind.

The stage is aniniism, Dr. Bell
continued, the worship of any-
thing al . The conclusion that
man is the most wonderful thing
alive was finally reached, and
man has never gone beyond the
thought that the mystery which
is God is like men, the lecturer-
stressed.

“We must convince ourselves
that there is a God," Bell insist-
ed.

To do this it is necessary to
follow Lhe line of probability.
The basis of such thought is that
it is vastly more probable that
there is a God than that there
isn’t, hc said.

Bell referred to the two best
known probable argiments, the
scientific and the artistic, to sup-

Plans for secondary flight in-
struction at Grinnell under thc
Civil Aeronautics authority are
indefinite, Grant 0. Gale, CAA
head on campus, announced to~
day.

Virgil Bayne, ground school Su-
pervisor at Des Moines, informed
Gale Saturday that because of de<
creased appropriations from the
government, it is doubtful that
the course will be introduced to
any more schools for some time.

However, Cole is awaiting def-
inite word from the supervisor and
may receive further information
later in the week.

If the course is included in the
curriculum, it will involve 103

Plan Dorm

Meal Tickeis

To Go To Town Men
For Closer Conlacf
Willi College Residenfs

Town Men may eat in the dorm—
itory dining room, if a plan now
under consideration goes into ef—
fect, Duane Arnold, president of
the group said today.

The plan, similar to one adopted
by the Town Women, calls for
a meal ticket, granting each man
a certain number of meals in the
dining room each month. “I hope
the plan will be put into effect
soon, since it will give the Town
Men a closer association with the
dorm residents,” Arnold said.

Reynolds Norton and Jack
Trucsdale have been elected to
represent the group in the iri<
tramiiral debates which begin
Nov. 17, Arnold added.

All Town Men interested in vol-
ley—ball are urged to contact Car~
los Kotila as soon as possible, so
that practice may begin, and a
team organized to participate in
niramural competition.
