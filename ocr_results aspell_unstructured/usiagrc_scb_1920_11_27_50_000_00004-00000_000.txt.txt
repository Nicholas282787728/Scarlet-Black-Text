K0 Argument

students with the unfairness of the
trick, wanted to debate the question
with them ,and “chatted" them with
being strain or the facts. The Brit»
ish boys were firm, but admitted that
the American was right so far as the
”question" was concerned.
they "did not want their rights ins
vaded.” Then they added: "It is the
opening of thc year and you would
have too good an opportunity with the
raw material (a luf. of Freshmen).
We can't afford to let you start your
ideas among them for we want our
beer." It was all done in :I joking
’lnanuei‘, and a jolly chat was held
along the way.

After driving out about six miles,
they put Mi‘. \Varner off on the dark
lonely road. The "army deportation”
was ended. However the boys/pointed
out some lights about fifteen minutes'
wall: away, and told him that there
‘he would he able to get a bus to the
,City limits where he would be able to
get a car to his. hotel. They then re-
turned by another route. When Mr.
Warner got back, of course it was
too late for his meeting.

Mr, Warner’s good sportsmanship
over the "Tagging” made for him
many fl'iends,‘a.1.\d the incident was
,given wide publicity in all British
