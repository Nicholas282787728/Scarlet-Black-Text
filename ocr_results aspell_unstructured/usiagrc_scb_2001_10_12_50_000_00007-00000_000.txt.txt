The signs up around campus advertised the “Theatre 380 Ad
vanccd student Directing Project," but the two plays that were
presented last weekend were known mostly as “Tom’s" and uTim's"
Probably very few people in the audience realized the difference
between these shows and the shows the senior Theatre majors had
directed in the page But fotTom Robson ‘02 andTim Kerber ‘02,
the student directors, last weekends shows were a completely new
experience.

“it was much harder and much longer than anything i've ever
done," says Kcrbet, who directed Army: in Show Bruinm, “It in-
volves a much bigger group than an Open space production: stu-
dent set designers, lighting designers, and faculryadwsors " Robson,
director of Their/retire, agreed, “Working with the Flanagan space
involved a very different set oftools."

Kerber chose Jane Martin’s Amp, 3 comedy about a regional
(heatrc’s production of Chekhov's Th: Th”: Sisters, because "I
thought it was wildly runny. it talked to and about theatre. There
was new stuffin it. It shows that theatre is not a dead art." Pre-
sented by nine women who play sDtteen
roles. the play chauenged audiences to think
about how they perceive their world. When
actors appeared on stage as different char
utters, Kerber said, “The audience is forced
to play rhesarne games that theactors play."
A character that aeu as an audience mem-
ber helps point out the tensions between
character and actor identities, most nota-
bly asking why women are playing men.
The characters on stage explain that they
are trying to contradict the male»driven
world that is the theatre business, “I Just
thought that was really funny,” says Kerber.
Acred primarily by women making their
Grinnell college acting debuts, the play had
a few weak moments, but the show’s energy carried the actors
through these problems. The lighting and sound followed the story
lme naturally.

Robson welcomed Tony Kushner's “free adaptation" of Pierre
Comeille’s comedy, The Illutian because, u director, he got “the
biggest chanoe to be the storyteller," In a play all about the telling
ofstories, theatre itself, he was able to shape the world that every»

oneelsewouldsee. Healso liked

the not that the play, in its origi.

nal form, “was a rormulare 17th

century comedy," but Kushncr

gave it a more ambiguous end-

mg. “it's exciting to have the

audience expect one thing and

give them something else," he

said. The play opens on the cat,

of the play, the interactions be

nature of love and reality, lllmian plays with the audience's amen

tions, memories, and perceptions. As inArmm, most actors played

multiple roles, but the characters diltered only slightly, adding to
the dreamlike nature of the play The per.

actors, were generally strong and the light.

ing and sound transformed the Flanagan

theater into a dream world where nothing

was quite real.

For the two future directors, the 380
directing project was a natural nrxt step in
their Theatre majors. Both had begun
planning their proposals during their
sophomore years. Department head Pip
Gordon says that this kind of advanced
planning is a must for anyone interotcd in
this competitive project, applitations for
which are due two semeters in advance.
She emphniud that the directing project
is an upper level course and, as for any seminar, there are prerequi-
sites. Applimlion requirements include “demonstrated excellence"
in Directing l, at least one open space production, assistant direcrr
ing experience, and a proposal Lhal includes the rationale behind
the production. research and analysis ormc proposed play, and an
idea oicasting and technical concepts.

This is the ﬁrst year that requirements have been so oihciaily

articulated. Before, says Gordon, “there were just a lot of unspor
ken expectations. Thrseguidelino ciariiy rhesoopeoirhese projects.
And its easier ior students to have more steps in deadlines." The
rules need to be strict, she explains, beoarne orthe huge responsi—
bility oidirceting. “A student director is responsible for his own
work, but also for everyone else: the actors. the designers, everyone
involved,"

working almost entirelywith studentswas one orthe best parts
for both directors. “it rally is a class project," says Kerber. “I had
14 people volunteer to work with me. it was so exciting.”

Thinking back, Robson admits that he chose his stage manv
ager, Katie coup ’05, last November. “I just asked her and she said
yes. 1 knew we worked well together and i knew she’d do a good
job."

Their actors enjoyed this aspect ofthe production as well. Shr
annon Heirernan '04, said, “Knowing that a production was all
students made me communicate with the directors and designers
on a diirerent level." Giovanni Conn ’04, sums up the erperienoe,
“All that bullshit is gone. There's no director trying to pull a power
trip on you. I felt like nm was a big brother."

The 380 project was mated three yam ago, when the depan.
ment restructured the major with the hope of strengthening the
acting and directingcomponents. At most undergnduare schools,
there is nothing like this. “it's really an exceptional oppomuiity ior
the student who shows excellence in directing," says Gordon, addr
ing how very impresedshewas by her students work. “They both
handled it exceptionally"
