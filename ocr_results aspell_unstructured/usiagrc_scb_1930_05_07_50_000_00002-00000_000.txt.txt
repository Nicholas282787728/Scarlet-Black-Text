However there is one respect in which the playing

wish to play tennis, even the tennis team, in the after-
noon, they must plan to take at least two and a half
hours to do it. An hour and a half of this time must he
spent in waiting for a free court.

This easily could be remedied by having a "sign-
up” system. A list could he posted every morning that
the courts are in playing condition, and those men that
wanted to play could sign up for the court and hour
they wished. In this way they could be assured of u
court at a deﬁnite time, and they would not be forced
to wait an hour or so for a free one. The list could be
handed to the student working on the courts and thus
avoid any possible disputes. This would entail a little
trouble on Scmeone’s part, but would be well worth it
to all who like to play tennis.
