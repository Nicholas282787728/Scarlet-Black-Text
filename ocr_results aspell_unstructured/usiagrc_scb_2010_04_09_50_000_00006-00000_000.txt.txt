"Vicky [Dicdrichs '11] and l were sitting on the d—hall patio eating dinner, We noticed the sky
getting dark we moved inside. The rain picked up. A minute or so later we couldn't see a foot past
the windows on either side ofthe d‘hall.

We discussed how the d-hall was a glass death trap. We didn't want to die in Lhe d-hall. We
decided to leave the d-hall.we got distracted and hung out with Dodge [Greenley’ll] and Alex
[Phillips ’12] outside the d—hall.

This meant that ifn tornado had in fact made its way through the JRC, we would have died in
the lobby ofthc dehall. This would have been very close to dying in the d-hall,The whole time I
thought about how shitty it would be ifone ofthe trees around my house esmashed [sic] my car,

on account or the storm. This would have been terrible. 1 love my car. I put this bad thought
out or my mind and made my way to the library Ben and Rachel informed me dint my house wns
destroyedl thoughtthis was ridiculous. I looked out a library window and noticed hilta nee leaning
against our porch. i had never known this particular tree to interact with our porch in such i friendly
manner.

i went to my house to investigate. There was a huge hole in the rooﬁThis was worrisome. Then
we played Settlers ofClitan. We did not play the greatest gaunt: otHigh street sardines ever. I was
sad'l'hen I handewrote a paper because technology was dead. 1 was sad."

When Iwzlku‘l back to Main from the dining hall at around 5:50 onTucsday, the wentherwas
hardly intimidating. Aside from a few raindropsl had no reason to believe a severe thunderstorm
was approaching. in any case, I got in the elevator in Main (1 live on the 4th ﬂoor) as per usual.

Unfomlnately, the power went out by the time the super slow elmtot was a couple offset
from reaching its destinationrhe elevator stopped, a small emergency light went on, and l reale
iznd Iwas stuck I didn’t really know what was going on outside, but screams from the inhabitants
ofMain assured me that power was out in die whole building 1 immediately took out my cell
phone and called security

The woman who answered the call responded to my situation by saying, “You're stuck in
there? Oh shitl I’ll let the security ofﬁcer on duty know.” once I hung up, I heard a great deal of
water ﬂowing on top time, as if he elevator was suspended inside a watcrtnll. I wasn't sure (and
am not sure now) whnt to make ottliatl guess that wis kind orscary. it was really, renlly not too.

To make a long story short, stipehsecurity man Russ came 45 minutes later and busted me
out with a crowbar Before then, a couple or great friends came to comfbn me ﬁom outside the
elevator, not to mention the many friends who gave me calls and text messages otconsolation/
amusement. It wasn't that bad!

lwent to the library ligating that there would be power there, but 1 was wrong, No power,
no lights, 1 headed to Cleveland to do seine work. The problem with the donus is that only the
hallwnys and bathrooms are lit,

Nammlly, this tumed out to bl: another unsucoessnil taropaign, because lwas disemcted by all
of the hm residcne orCleieland hanging out in the hilllvlmy. Neat thingl know, I'm taking shots
and thinking nboutwhcrel can get more alcohol. '

l drove around looking tor an open store in Gnnnell around 9:15 at night, and lbund nothing
not even WaleMartl Alittle voice said, ”Drive ﬁuuhcr...“sol did and found l<um &G0 was open.

I picked up two 24 packs ofbeet and you can guess where the night went. There are a couple
ot tun things to do when the power is out, waiting for the power to come baek on is not one of
them. Might as well ﬁnd a reason to celebrate... i did.

Unfortunately for Chloe [Moryl’10,who serves as 563 CerditoreineChief], our group
of friends has established what we like to call “the semester of yesf" We like to play this
game where one or us will propose a ridiculous course of action, and if there is a naysayer, we
get an automatic veto.

Why? Because we're second semester seniors. You need to live it up sometime, right?
Anywho. Thunderstorms are n’brewin,’ and it is time to head to McNally’s to meet Colin
[Higgins ’10] and make summer salad because it is omcially, well, not summer, but almost?
Chloe, burdened by work, says no.

Banal Veto! Seconds later, we’re running in the pleasant downpour from High Street to
town. All’s well until the loudest crack of thunder I have ever heard overwhelms us, and we
take shelter in the awning of the Catholic Church.

What started with us chilling next to the Virgin Mary watching the storm ended in us
practically clutching the statue and a constant voice in my head saying, “Please, God, tell me
I didli’tjust kill Chloe.” The storm eventually subsides, and we make it to Manlly’s where
the power is out and we have to consequently squeak around the store with a ﬂashlight, leav-
ing a little water trail behind us.

In retrospect it would have been wise to maybe pick up potential meals and a candle or
two, but with chips and an obscenely llttge horde ofwine in hand, we walk back to High
Street. As we stop to clear roof debris from the middle of the street, Chloe turns and says, “I
would like you to know that I am very seriously considering canceling the semester ofyes."

I'm pretty sure that's fair!
