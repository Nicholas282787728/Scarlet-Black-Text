Q Conservative Crane Visits

by David Blatt
For the first time in recent
memory, a noted conservative
Under the
sponsorship of the Program in
Practical Political Education,
Representative Philip Crane (Re
Ill.) lectured on conservative

' and philosophy oi
government last Friday night in
the South Lounge,

Introduced by PPPE member
Bob Skolnik as “a young, are
ticulate representative oi the
conservative viewpoint,” Crane
seemed to impress most students
with his eloquence, if not With his
Views on the issues.

A history Ph D and a member of
.he House Ways and Means

’Committee, Crane spoke iirst
about the general conservative
view of government and then

“proceeded to specifics He touched

mostly on economic matters.
stressing the limitations 0!
government and the evxls ot
irresponsible monetary and fiscal
policies, He also warned against
the dangers of a growing
bureaucracy and the accumulation
oi power in Washington

Roberta Alwell, chairman of the
PPPE committee. thought it was
good to have a representative oi
conservative philosophy on
campus and that Crane was “very

-llvnamic and articulate."

However, she doubted the logical

foundations oi Crane's arguments

and wished there had been more
ime and more people to question

The Grinnell College radio
station, KDICVFM, has applied to
the Federal Communications
Commission for a renewal of its
broadcast license, The station will
be notified sometime in April as to
the status oi its request ior license
renewal.
Under FCC regulations, KDIC
must reapply tor its license every
. nree years. >
KDIC station Manager Jon
Herman feels that the station’s
chances for license renewal are
“pretty good" but notes that the
r C renewal process is far from
automatic. Rumors have been
circulating in the past few months
among radio circles that the FCC is
trying to phase out as many non—
proiit 10 watt stations as possible.
Herman said he has heard
reports oi a 1000 watt commercial
station in central Iowa that may be
'trying to get KDIC’s assigned
frequency: 88.5 megahertz on the
. FM’ band. Herman stressed,

Rep. Philip Crane

Alter several humorous anecV
doles, Crane explained the cone
servativephilosophy “We take. . ,
a rather dim view of what
government can and cannot do.”
Noting that the federal govern
ment more oitcn does things to us
than for us, he recited part oi
Jefferson's first inaugural: “A
wise and irugal government, which
shall restrain men from injuring
one another, shall leave them
otherwise free to regulate their
own pursuits oi industry and ime
provement, and shall not take irom
the mouth of labor the bread it has
earned; this is the sum of good
government.” \

Crane then showed how far the
government oi today has strayed
from Jefferson’s principles. A wise
government, he said, does not try
to alter basic human nature by
direct action. Human nature is
more or less constant, and a
capacity tor wickedness is an
important part oi it, he said. A

however, that these are, at
present, unsubstantiated rumors
and may have no bearing on the
FCC’s handling of KDIC’s request
for license renewal,

One of the FCC requirements for
stations applying tor license
renewal is that they submit ior
examination, along with the ap-
plication, a full week of the actual
operating log, Upon close
examination oi the log, Herman
iound to his dismay that there was
not a single week of error-free logs.
“There were irregularities
everywhere,” he said. “People
would make up their own abe
breviations and incorporate them
into the log. it was a mess."

In addition to the irregularities
in logging procedure, KDIC has
experienced other problems. Last
semester, the Station Suffered
repeated attacks of vandalism and
ﬁlievery. As a result of these
problems, and because KDIC was
applying to the FCC for license
renewal, the executive board of

government which concentrates
power in an “imperial presidene
cy,” even with the best of motives,
tempts late by laying the basis for
dangerous abuses of power he
added. '

Turning to the duties of a frugal
government, Crane claimed that
the US had nearly ruined its
economy by pursuing the
discredited policies oi Keynesian
economics. Beginning with the
New Deal, he said, these policies
have severed the connection
between gold and paper money and
consequently debauched the
currency, The collapse in the value
0! paper money creates economic
contusion and turmoil by iueling
inilation and by i removing
discipline irom government
spending. he said,

Moreover, Crane Said, inflation
caused by excessive government
spending actually creates a hidden
tax and is an evasion oi i‘espone
sibility on the part of the Congress.

KDIC applies for
license renewal

KDIC instituted a new set of rules
designed, says Herman, “to
tighten up security at the station"
and to effect a “more professional
standard of behavior" from the
DJ's. ,

The new rules ban the use of all
intoxicants at the station. The
penalty for those caught violating
the new rules is immediate and
indeiinite suspension from the
KDIC staff, Two members of the
stall have already been suspended
this semester for Violation of the
new rules, in addition to What
Herman terms “unprofessional
behavior."

Herman feels that the ban on
intoxicants has improved the
quality oi the programming as well
as reduced the instances of van-
dalism, He does, however, think
that the ban will be lifted sometime
in me near future. But he come
merited, “We wanted to make the
DJ’s aware of the need for a more
professional attitude. I think mat’s
been achieved."
