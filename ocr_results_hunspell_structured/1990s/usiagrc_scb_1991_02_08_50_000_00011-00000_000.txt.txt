Kohawks

By Michael D. Patterson

The big, bad Coe
Kohawks came to Darby Gymnar
siumlastSaturday,andshowedwhy
they are still one of the premier
men‘s basketball teams in the Mid-
west Conference, The Kohawks
were in control most of the way,
using tenacious defense and a ma-
ture, patient offense to wear Grin-
nell down. They were ahead by 10
at the half and ended up beating the
Pioneers 107-87.

The Coe guard tandem of
Peter Birkey and Eric Johnson ex-
pertly handled the Pioneer press.
Once Coe got into their half-court
offense, they were nearly impos
sible to stop. Birkey ended up
leading all scorers with 28, and EJ.
added lSpoianand 14assists. Mark
Kleppe lived up In his billing as a
member of the all~Windex team,
cleaning the glass on 17 separate
occasions. Kleppe also added 13
points to Coe’s balanced scoring
attack, and made his presence felt
with hisphysical style ofplay. Jun-
ior center Chris lacobsen was in
foul trouble most of the game, but
still managed to score 15 for the
Pioneers. Freshman forward Jason
Fiancl also had 15 for Grinnell,
while point guard Todd Young
added 14 points and 6 assists,

Grinnell, though, could
not put it all together against the
talented Kohawks. Pioneer head
coach David Aisenault was very
impressedwith Coe'sperformance.
“They have enough talent to ex-
pose our weaknesses," Arsenault
said. “We still have a lot of holes,
which I hope we can fill through
recruiting."Itdoesn'tgetanyeasier

Mad Dogs

By Steve Clem

The Mad Dogs easily de-
feated a Northeast Missouri State
swim team lastFriday evening. 137-
93. The Pioneers won 8 out of 13
events, with a number of team
members becoming double-winr
ners.

Coach Ray Obermiller
said," The team looked very good,
and I think were exactly where we
want to be. I think that the only
Weak link in our chain right now is
the backstroke events.”

Pioneers that had strong
performancesincludedl,P.Fiening
in the 1000 Free and 200 Back.
Dave Ressner in the 500 Free and
200 Fly, Joe Zimsen in the 4001M,
Scott Truelove in the 200 Breast,
and Luther Davis in the 50 Free. “I
tell you one swimmer who looked
good in the meet was Dave Troy.
Heisreally startingtocomearound.
I was also proud of Jeff Mahari in
thediving events,"said0bermiller.

Tomorrow. the Mad Dogs
will travel back to Luther College
in Dubuque for the State Small
College Swim meet. “We have
never lost this meet, and I don’t

Indoor track season
begins for women

By Doug liodurn

The women' s indoor track
team traveled to Central to open
their season this past Saturday.
While this was their first meet, it
was a friendly meet In which no
scores were kept and no awards
given. According to Coach Evelyn
Freeman, this was a “perfect meet“
to start the season with. With only
two weeks of prcparauon for the
season behind them, no one really
had any expectations, which air
lowed many of the women to at-
tempt events that they were not
used to participating in. The gen-
eral relaxed atmosphere allowed
some of the team rookies to run in a
meetwithoutthepressureofacom-
pctitivc situation.

Despite the lack of pres-
sure there were some highlights of
the meet. Coach Freeman com-
mented that, “Anne I-Iollister had a
good day" with some of her best
indoor times of her career at Grin-
nell. She ran "an aggressive lace"
and won the 600 meter race. Another
memorableperfonnancewasturned
in by Katherine Fairbanks who ran
in Ihreeevents.Allliougltsheplaced
third in both the 1000 meter and

1500 meter races, which 15 excelr
lent. she managed to win the 3000
meter run. Another excellent per
formance look placc in the 300
meter dash. Rookies Ris Taylor
and Amy Gcmon finished 1-2 in
the 300 meter run. They finished
with exactly Lhesame limes, which
they had planned prior to the start.

Themeetallowed someof
the women to become accustomed
to competition. The Pioneers also
used the meet as a chance to adjust
to possible new events. Although
Ihelndoorseason hasscvcralmocts,
Coach Freeman mentioned that the
Conference meet is the only one
that is truly emphasized, and that
many of the team members use the
indoor season as a tune-up for the
outdoor season.

The next meet for the
women runners, which is viewed as
the Soulhem Conference champi-
onships, is this weekend. The meet
will be scored and, while it will be
more competitive than last week’s
was. it will still be relaxed. After
all. the team is still welcoming new
members to the team. These new
members will begin entering true
competition when they adjust to the
training,
