Jeremy goes to the Turn on the radio

movies — spoooky!
Trick or Treatin’ Talbert

(Jeremy) gets freaked by a
handful of thrillers

This week's ﬁlms ate all ltl cclr
ebratloli ol' tlial crazy holiday, Hnlr
lowecn. I think they are supposed
to be, because at least two ol them
are about people who would just as
soon eat your face as look at it

Do you lcmelllbel the I' ’t limo
you saw Silence oft/re mini/nit I do,
because I had nightmares about the
movie for a week afterwards, This
has quickly become a classic attire
scary psycho gent-c started by our
other film. aptly named P3\'Clltl.
Starring Jodie Foster arid Anthony
Hopkins. this basic idea nl‘tllis lilm
is that the FBI is stumped on how to
catch a psychotic killer who skins his
victims. They tilrll to Hannibal Lec-
tor, King of People Screwed in the
Head, I'm not going to spend too
much time talking about this movie
so I'll just touch on some highlights
Foster zind Hopkins have really great
onesercen chemistry. I’llllllliblll Lec-

tor eats people, uses them as Hallow; .

cen costumes, and does malty other
creative things wnh them. A lot of
these thlngs are depicted iii the ﬁlm.
so either don't go il'you have a weak
stomach, or don't eat dinner that
night. I give this movie 3 out of 4
tapestries made flom human skin.

The movte I really want to talk
about today is the Hitchcock classic
starring Antholiy Perkins. Frye/la.
Okay, I have a confesSlon. I never
saw this movie before this week. I
mean, I‘d hcald the story Iglless,
because so much of it has become a
part of our inoileciiltute, but I never
really thought about watching it.
Boy, was I stupid. This ﬁlln has got
it all, arid way before its time

The story is of ii young woman
who has an affair with ii bankrupt
man who cannot many her. At her
work, she IS handed $40,000 dollars
and told to take it to the bank, Yeah.
right, Her boss wasn't paying atten-
tion to the plot development in the
first scene So she takes the money
and runs. There s a lot of character
development here. and it‘s not really
scary. or any thing, but the music
makes everything very tense 171*
nally, one rainy night on her way to
wllere her lover lives, she sees the
irglrt or a motel along the deserted
highway. It reads, through the wa-
tcry windshield, "Bates Motel."
Wow. haven’t I heard of this some-
where? From here it's pretty simple
Girl meets Boy. Boychecks Girl ililo
hotel. Girl gets killed in showcl by
Boy‘s mothel,

The first tlllng I loved about
Psycho is the cinematography Dc-

spite it being in black and white.
Hitchcock manages to weave all of
liissliots into a flowmg piece of work.
Some ol'tlie angles seem very odd at
times, bill they make sense At the
time, his style was not very common,
bill I think you see it a lot irlore often
now. The next thing was the music.
Whi it: not necessarily being good, the
music did a wonderful job of keep-
ing the a little tense even when the
ﬁlm was dragging. Halfoflhe movie
was character development and
setup, so it was easy to forget that
this was supposed to be horror. It has
probably one ofthc ﬁrst suprise end
in_s iii history, and it has even be-
come a standard ill the genre now.
This movie really sets the standard
for years to come, and forthat it gains
my appreciation. I give this movie
three and a half mother’.l Yes
mother... alright mother.... no, I won't
do it!

Um, anyway, speaking of genre
setting lilms, we have one last film
this weekend. There are certain lnaSr
ters of the horror genre; among them
are Hitchcock, Clive Barker, and, ﬁ
nally, Wes Craven. This man is
isrck’l‘ I really wonder if he is the
one good result ofguidance council-
lors. “Okay, Wes, you like to draw
pictures of people being skewered by
household appliances maybe you
should go into ﬁlm?" Regardless of
how he got started. he’s brought us
the ﬁlms that deﬁne to a generation
what horror ﬁlms are. With Scream,
he breaks his rules and formulas, and
has a lot of fun at the expense ofhim-
self.

The basic plot is that someone is
killing lilgh school students and eve
cryone IS a suspect. Sidney (Neve
Campbell of“Farty of Five") is one
gal who is not to be tuned with. For
some reason, she’s the center of air
lemon for this masked tnurderer,‘and
slie kicks some badguy as, con-
stantly avoiding hiln in a nonstop ride
of terror. Well, at least, it was for
me. The movie does a wonderfuljob
at keeping you on the edge of your
seat. and it blends good old slasher
l’right with a dark, horrorrmovie re-
lated sense of humor that will actu-
ally probably make you laugh
outloud at some point. Wondering
who the killer is keeps you guessing
the whole way through, and I think
that‘s what Craven had in mind.
You’ll be supi'lsed. 1 give this ﬁlm
four out of four broken rules of the
horror ﬁlm formula. I don't like hot-
ror movies. but I *rcally* liked this

Staff Writer

Immediately a: I entered the
room, [fell II. There was something
(ll‘ﬂercnl about the air in there,
sailietlliltg,..siylirh. After culling a
Swat/1 Ihlottgh all me honeys, I
caught sight of them at lasl, 1/lree
guys arida yellow glove. They called
it Eric. They call their show
Esaierrorism and you can catch it
every Thursday afterhaohfmnt 4:10;
6:00pm. They themselves are
Donovan Sherman, Andy Pressman,
Dan Hackbarlh, and Eric
Van Denlark.

LW : So,what kind of
music do you guys play?

Donovan: We play all
sorts of stuff. Except folk
music because we hate it.

Andy: Do we play mun
sic to {*ck sh*t up?

Donovan: Yes.

Eric: Ha ha.

Andy: Please don‘t
censor that phrase. You
can spice this up, if you
like. Add curse words or
nudity or whatever.

Eric: Ha ha.

Donovan: Yes, I eat
children. So what?

Donovan: We have our
message, too, the theme
for our show.

Dan: Our manifesto.

Andy: It’s called juxtaposition.

Eric: Ha ha.

Donovan: He laughs like an old
man ataswimmingpool, in the shal~
low end.

Dan: We like to Show the origin
oflliodern day pop music by exam»
inlng its roots and the other exp0r
nents of those roots.

Andy: For example, we have
played The Clash next to Shizuo next
to Madonna next to Wesley Willis.

Donovan: We each bring in dif-
ferent aspects of pop culture in our
own unique stylings. It encourages
diversity,

Andy: _Eric brings in the sort of
ambient sound mixes.

Eric: Yes.

Donovan: Oh. we should sing you
our theme song.

All three—and the gloverin har»
mony: Esoterrorism, your weekly
radio show. If you do not listen, we
will kill your first born child.

Dan: Sung to the tune of “Dance
in the Hall of the Mountain King"
from the Pier Gynt suite'.

Donovan: I like to think that my
musical interests are more towards
the indie rock scene, as well as skim-
ming the surface of punk.

Dan: 1 can shoot lasers out of my
eyes

Vy Barkauskas spent the summer
in Grinnell writing a novel, which
she has titled AIIUIIVMUNJ‘L’. “It's a
1984rish scc'rrar-ro iil which [he
Internct has become heavily cen-
sored," Barkauskas said. “It's about
theeffect ofteclinology on the world,
on personal relationships. and on the
way society functions, It deals with
issues of sexuality and technology
and how tlicy interac " The title ol'
the novel is the main character's
pseudonym.

Barkauskas was able to spend the
summer writing ti norcl lit part be
cause ol‘ funding i‘rorri Pamela
Ferguson “I got a small amount at
funding, enough to support me while

I worked part time," Barkauskas said.

Barkauskas is currently revising
the novel, “There is a lot of reVlsion
to do. which is part of the process,”
she said. “As I go back, I’m ﬁnding
pages I don't remember writing. I
just sort of let my hands do it. The
ﬁlial draft lnay look very little like
the ﬁrst draft." She will begin look-
ing or publishers once she is ﬁnished
revising

“I would love to dedicate some
time to it rlgltt now, but I have been
busy with classes" she continued. “I
have slightly mixed feelings. You-
cant pretend you are going to write
the best book ill the world, On the
bi ight side, I did this. I wrote a novel,
and that‘s something to be proud of."

“I just want to encourage people.

A SPECIAL RELEASE
BY MARCUS MORAN

Auditions are being held on Mon-
day, November 3rd for the annual
Student Directed One-Acts. There
will be two audition times, 4:15 and
10:00. only one ofwhich actors need
to show up for. Everyone is wel-
come to attend these auditions—
THERE IS NO EXPERIENCE
NECESSARY! With 28 parts up for
grabs, we hope to see many students
during one ofthese two times at the
Arena Theatre in the FlneArts build-
ing on Monday, Scripts are on re-
serve new in Burling Library for
anyone interested in looking over the
scripts for the eight plays.

Donovan: And who needs music?

Andy: I think 1 represent the
subgenres such as per say ifyou will
albeit in so far as to say that I listen
to music. In speciﬁc, I represent the
ﬁne line between punk and techno,
exempliﬁed in bands on the digital
hardcore label and other bands such
as Pop Will Eat Itself, Brainiac, and
others.

Donovan: But that's not the real

honeys swoon]

listen to a lot of ska.

terest in the roots of Jamaican mu—
sic,

L.W.: What’s the
Esoterrorism all about?

Dan: Nothing.

Donovan: Let's look at the two
words that we are combing. Number
one, esoteric. And the other word,
gorgeous young men. It’s an attack
on our listeners of sorts, through a
strange and oftentimes humorous
vehicle of attack. How: strange and
erotic and ergonomic.

L.W.: You've done some crazy
stuﬂ‘ on your show. Can you tell me
a little bit about that?

Andy: Subversion through black
humor, that’s my motto.

Donovan: We mix with the music

name

certain elements of performance to
demonstrate our black humor, such
as dropping things on the old. We
dropped a wheelchair on them for
irony. God called in and we yelled at
him once. He was Ukrainian.

Dan: We have brief moments of
genius.

Donovan: And moments of idiocy.

L.W.: Is there anything in par-
ticular you’d like your listenels to
know about you?

Donovan: You should at least try
us once.

Andy: Black humor is like heroin.
Ask Eric about that. It‘s his theory.

Erie: Ha ha.

Andy: I‘m afraid of
needles, so I don‘t buy
into that theory. My drug
of choice is ether.

Dari: Anyway. We‘re
addictivewr so the ladies
tell us.

Eric: Ha ha.

Dan: Maybe you will
find us addictive too.

Andy: I believe the
problem isn't with what
the listeners don’t knowr
it‘s with what those who
are not listening don’t
know.

Donovan: We step on
kittens 2 lot.

Andy: I think of all the
people that we mock cru-
elly, we mock ourselves the most.
Well, that’s not including the From-
ise Keepers. Andy (that's me talking
in third person) has this pet theory
that we sort of fall into the footsteps .
of the Daily Show.

L.W.: Well, do you have any clos-
ing comments?

Andy: We killed Kenny.

Donovan: Remember, if you don't
like us, it‘s not our fault.

Andy & Donovan: It's yours.

Donovan: It’s a small campus.
We‘ll find you.

Andy: IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THE PHRASE WE HATE
WHAT YOU HATE AND WE
HATE YOU.

Eric: Ha ha.

The “Bev” Corner

Arranged by Pam Wcsik and Aden Beihl

“Peach Pit Babylon”

Just as Hanson inquires. “Where‘s
the love?" we must do the same as
we take a look into the sordid world
ef“Bev" (aka 90210).

Some “some"... some of thems
are getting it, and then there are those
that aren’t. Kelly and Brandon—can
wejust say that they are getting way
too much of it? On the table...in the
elevator...WHAT7l7!7 And Kelly's
chlpmunky nibbles are so repulsive
that they make us yeam for the days
of Emily Valentine. As the lovable
Steve said himself, “It‘s making me
naushl" (as in nauseous) Speaking
of the grotesquely deformed Kelly,
we join Randy in wondering “Just
who the hell put Kelly through the
fatmachinc?" Mayhaps she has for—
gotten (in her amnesia, of course)
that she miscarried last season, and
she is not supposed to be eating l2
burgers an hour at the Peach Pit.
You...Kelly...no longer eating for
two!

Well, at least they've got commu—
nication; that‘s more than you can
say for Donna and David. 0h,
David...hiding the truth...stealing
money from Donna...it's no good. Is
this really the way you treat the
woman who gave you her...heart'?

And then there‘s Valerie - once
again left alone on the dance floor
because her evil scheming plans
backﬁred on her. No Cooper + No
Boat Boy : No Booty for Val.

On a positive note, Steve and
Carly seem to be making their rela-
tionship work. Well, considering
that Steve had to settle for Carly
since Boat Boy is denying his true
feelings for him. We all know that
secretly these two boys were des~
tined to be together.

ATTENTION - Donna fashion
update: Donna’s hair actually
looked pretty good at the beginning
of this episode. There was deﬁnitely
too much red activity going on,
though. Red hai d lipstick...red
dress. And something has got to be
done about her cleavage; put them
away! We aren’t watching the show
to see her breasts...we’re watching
it for the bean-wrenching, valuable
lessons that are being taught.

Which brings us to Bev’s valuable
lesson this week (a love tip, if you
will): You know it‘s Lrue love when
your signiﬁcant other evokes “holy
shaken not stirred” feelings in you.

-Steve Sanders

QUAD TIP OF THE WEEK:
Ok...for all of you out there who still
put your trays on the beverage
bar...it‘s got to stop! Oh sure, it was
understandable when you were a
prospective, but come on! There‘s
no need for it! These trays only serve
as a barrier between you and the tasty
beverages you need to satisfy your
parchage. Please, no more.
