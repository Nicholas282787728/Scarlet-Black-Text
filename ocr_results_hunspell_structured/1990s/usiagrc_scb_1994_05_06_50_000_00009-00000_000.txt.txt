Letters from the Old World

Part XI—Easterrt Europe
By Riva Sharples, Foreign Correspondent

 

 

FTER spending just two short weeks traveling in Western Europe, Jason and I were broke. tired and
travel weary. Luckily, we were headed for the East, where things were still relatively cheap and where
we had friends to visit Budapest was our first Stop, where we planned to stay with Jenny Wagner,

a Grinnelljunior studying math there for six months. Jason arid l easily found our way around the confusing
Budapest tram system to her place. Nobody Spoke English; we had trouble justbuying tickets for the tram! The
streets and addresses didn’t make any sense to us. We couldn’t even figure out the money system. Inﬂation
in Budapest is incredibly high. One forint isn’t even worth one-tenth of a penny. We tnade it to Jenny's
apartment. She lived down a narrow street a few blocks across the Danube River, on the Burla side ofthe city.
Budapest is divided by the river into two sections. Buda and Pest. Buda is the oldest section of town and very
hilly, while Pest is “the heart of the modern city," according to Let': Go Europe.

Budapest is beautiful. Once the site ofa Roman settlement, and an important city of the Habsburg empire
and just recently a center of Communism underRussia, the city‘s interesting history is reﬂected in the majestic
domes, cathedrals, and square, Communism-influenced buildings that are scattered throughout the city.

Budapest is a bustling with intellectual and cultural activity. Jazz clubs, coffee shops, and poetry readings
are big. Theeity is supposedly overrun with Americans, as one English magazine told me, but I sure didn’tmeet
any. Visiting the numerous coffee shops and cafes in Budapest, I was reminded ofBerkeley, California. Unlike
those of Paris and Western Europe, the coffee shops and cafes in Budapest, located down in somedark basement
or set out in some seemingly out-of-the-way place, are unique and seem to have a character all their own.

When we left Budapest, Jason and I went our separate ways. I headed for Warsaw via Prague while Jason,
out of cash and very tired of traveling, headed back to England. Of all the places I visited, I loved Prague the
best. The city is alive with activity. "lhere is a kind of excitement in the air, an energy present that is missing
in the reserved andcosmopotitan cities of Westem Europe. In Prague, where young people gather on the famous
Charles Bridge to sing I ohn Lennon songs and where vendors gather on the street to sell their crafts and old
communist relics, there is a uniqueness and character found nowhere else I took an overnight train from
Budapest to Prague, arriving at 5:59 in the morning. The streets were desened. Jason had taken the guidebook
with him, so I purchased a map from a newspaper agentwho was just opening his door and headed toward "Old
Town," which sounded like the place to be. Old Town, or “Staromestske namesti," the center square of Prague,
was breathtaking. Apart from the occasional school child scurrying through the square or for an old bum
sleeping on a bench, I was alone. lsat down under a giant statue of Jan Hus, a Czech meologlan, to wait for
a coffee shop or bakery to open, but the chilly morning air soon drove me to walk once more.

Feeling like a homeless person without direction oraim, I headed down a maze of narrow pedestrian streets.
I ended up at Charles Bridge, a wide pedestrian bridge along which statues of famous Czechs arid saints are
planted every few feet, In the early morning sunlight, the deserted bridge was mystical-looking, with the
silhouettes ofthe statues rising upin the misty, dewrlike morning airl I wandered over thebridge and then went
up to the top of defense tower, where I looked out over the city. By the tintel came down again, the streets were
beginning to be crowded with people and I again felt as though I was part of the world of the living.

I headed back to the Old Town square and was stunned at the crowds of people there. It was as if someone
had opened a large cattle gate and let in all of the tourists, with their fancy cameras and giant shopping bags,
into the square. Vendors lined one side of the street with their wagons and makeshift cardboard tables, selling
everything from wax ﬁgurines to homemade dolls to cigarette lighters. On the other side of the square, horse
and buggies awaited gullible (and wealthy) tourists. Young people stood everywhere, talking in small groups.
A few young boys, probably about 14 or 15, zoomed in and out of the crowd on skateboards. Street musicians
added to the noise and confusion in the square.

I could have spent a week in Prague, just wandering back and forth between the old town and Charles
Bridge. Unfortunately, I was only able to spend oneday therebeeausel had made arrangements to visit a friend
in Warsaw.

Student composer’s works to
be performed at recital tonight

By Sarah Wohlford

HE pieces performed at
I tonight‘s Senior Recital are
probably not familiar, but
chances are you have seen and per-
haps even had class with their corn—
poser. His name is Vineet Shanda,
and he is a senior music major at
Grinnell.

Shende has done a great deal
more than merelycomplcte the major
requirements. He is currently presi-
dent of Grinnell Singers, has been in
and directed for Collegium and
founded theGrinnellStudentOrches-
u-a, which debuted with his Composia
Lion “Memorial for Sarajevo".

Shende has applied to The
I uilllard School of Music’s graduate
school, and will receive word in late
May as to his acceptance. He hopes
to possibly go on to make a living
composingandconducting,orgethis
doctorate and teach.

Although Shende had quite a bit
of experience with music, such as
classical guitar lessons taken in high
school with a guitarist from the Chi
cago Symphony Orchestra, before
coming to Grinnell, hesays that much
of his musical growth has occurred
betel “Itwasn’tunu'lIjoinedSingers
here freshman year andwe did reper-
toires such as Benjamin Britten's
“Mass for St, Cecilia" that I really
began tobeawed by the power of that
kind of music Until then, I‘d done
classical guitar and played in bands."

In fact, out of the four people to
which Shendeauributeshis“involve—

ment in serious classical music," two
are professors here at Grinnelli He
credits John Stuhr-Rommereim with
“introducing me toreally great litera-
ture, like some of the pieces that we
sang my freshman year in Grinnell
Singers. That, combined with John
Chenette‘s classes, [helped me to]
analyze music theory and begin to
love it and be intrigued by iL Those
twothingscombinedbegan to awaken
me to music.”

His other musical inﬂuences are
GennancomposerGustav Mahleer
Russian composer Dmitri
Shostakovich, whose works Shende
listened to almost exclusively during
die period of his most significant
musical growthl

Shende began his composition
careerin highsehoolbywriting small
choral pieces. Morerecently, hecom-
posed a suite for guitar and entered it
in a Guitar Foundation of America
contest.

The cornerstone of tonight's per-
formance, at 8:00 pm. in Herrick
Chapel, will be Shende’s symphony,
“The Tempest," written for the vic-
tims of last summer’s ﬂood. "The
Tempest” recently won an award in
the Des Moines Symphony Compo—
sition Competition In addition to
Shende‘s performances of voice, pi-
ano and guitar pieces, Iohn Stuhr—
Rommereim will play a prelude and
fuguesetforpiano.andGrinnellSing-
or: will perform a choral piece. A
song from a song cycle Shende has
been working on will also be per-
formed.
