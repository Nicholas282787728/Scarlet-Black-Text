tion permit for the building, but
this would allow the contractors
to leave the building site wiLhout
complcling all of tttc work.

Another holdup, adds Boat,
is the nccusity of the architects
signature to signify that the
building is indecdcomplctc. The
alchilectsull needs to make one
final inspection of the site to
ensure its safety. Due to these
factors. the opening date for tttc
ccnlcr has been dclnyed. Baa:
