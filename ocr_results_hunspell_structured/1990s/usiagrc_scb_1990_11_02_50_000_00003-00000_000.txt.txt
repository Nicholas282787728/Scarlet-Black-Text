headquarters. They were later
removed with razor blades by some
of thc protestors.

“It was neveran official plan for
the protesters to go into town,” said
Thom Main, one ofthe organizers.
“I had intentions of going into town.
I told other people I had intentions
ofgoing into town. Cenainly never

‘Thcnwearegoingtogointotown.“

Branstad appeared relatively
unfazed by the demonstration. stair
ing, “I’m not into confrontational
politics...l'm a consensus builder."
Referring to his speech in Main
Lounge, he said, “I think some
people agreed with my message. I
don’texpect everyone to agree with
me.” He told reporters from the
Grinnell Herald-Register that the
protest was no worse than those he
observed as a studentat the Univer-
sity of Iowa in the 19605.

To keep control over the pro-
ceedings, Grinnell police were
called. Several officers, including
Chief of Police Dan Boyer forced
students away from the front of the

building and out of the street. To
comply, the protest organizers
convinced demonstrators to Join
haiids and circle the building.

Some students cotnplained
about the reaction of the police.
Samantha Massingale complained
that she was shoved by an officer
as she was uying to move away
from the entrance. As the governor
was leaving, police attempted to
makeroom around thepatrol car in
which he was traveling.

Main did not believe the
protesters were unnecessarily
unruly.

“There was a ‘mob mentality'
to the level that we were excited
that we had Ihe opportunity to make
such a strong statement. There
was a huge turnout. There was a
great deal of interest. And we saw
the opportunity to make an even

there wasa‘mobmentality’. Butl

bitterly ot the disruption.

Branstad Meets With Heated
Questions During Speech

By Daniel Bliss

IowaGovemorTcrry Branstad's
question and answer sessions in
Main Lounge on Oct, 12 addressed
a number oi campaign issues and
student concerns with local and
nationachpublicanpolicles. While
Branstad’s speech was concerned
with the general health of the state
ollowa, students grilled him on his
stand on a number ofspccific issues
including the environmentandcivil
rights.

Branstad cited the economic
progress of the town of Grinnell as
an example of the improved
condition of Iowa under his
leadership. He mentioned the
Grinncll 2000 program and the
revitalization of the town center.

“Grinnell is truly a model
community," he added.

He also cited the strength of the
state‘scollegef‘inaacialaidprogram.
and said his efforts had helped it
cover an additional 4000 students
over the past four years. He stated
that the program was so strong that
the average income of the families
of students at private colleges in
Iowa was below that of those with
students attending the state
university system.

Branstad said also that the state
of Iowa needed to attract out-of»
slate mlent, particularly the case in
business and in education, where he
intends to raise average teacher
salaries to the national average
within four years. He emphasized
in his speech Iowa’s consistent lead
in the test scores of its graduating

high school students.

But the 15 minute question and
answer session did not touch on
educational issues. Questions were
fielded on the environment, the
homeless and Branstad’s recent
statements favoring a return of the
death penalty.

A student questioned him on
hisuseotthclincitem vetoagainst
various environmental legislation
during the past year. She alleged
that it had led to a 31 percent
reduction in state spending on the
environment. But Branstad
claimed that, in fact, actual
spendingwas,evcnaftcrhisuseof
his veto power, 70 percent above
what it was last year.

“In fact, the legislature went
totally overboard in spending. spent
the state into a deficit, and I, as
governor, had to make sure the
budget was balanced." He also
compared his record with that of
his opponent, House Speaker Don
Avenson. on the 1973 legislation
that led to the ﬁve cent deposit on
beverage containers. He said that
he had supported the deposit
scheme while Avcnson had
proposed to pay for recycling by
increasing the liquor tax.

Branstad had announced in
September that he intended to seek
from the legislature a restoration
of the death penalty. Capital
punishment, which was abolished
in Iowa in 1965, would be used in
the event of a murder being
committed to cover up another
crime for which Iowa law calls for
a life sentence, namely murder,

was asked whether an Iowa with a
death penalty could possibly
consider itself civilized.

In retort, he cited the recent case

murdered in Davenport. town. She

Local Dealer
Decides
Against Car
Donation

In response to the Branstad
protest carried out by Grinnell
students, Wes Finch has deCidcd
not to donate a car to the Gnnnell
College Community Service
Center. Finch ownsadealcrship of
both Chrysler and G.M.
automobiles. He also runs an
automobile repair business.

”I respect people‘s right to
protest," said Finch, but added that
he didn't like the “rowdy-rude
attitude that was portrayed” by
Grinnell students during the
demonstration. Finch said he was
further angered by the Grinnell
studean notallowing people toenter
the Republican headquarters by
circling the block and holding each
olhcr's hands.

Finch continued by saying he
hopes that Gi-innell students would
“show any state leader a little more
respect."

ThoughtheCommtInityScrvice
Center did not help to organize the
protest, Finch’s decision to not
donate thecarwas motivated by his
distaste for the manner of the
students at the protest.

”I guess that that was my way of
telling those students I don’t like
those kind of antics,“ said Finch.

By these studens, Finch was
referring to the students that
attended the protest march. Finch
added that he was concerned that
studentswhocouldconstitatefuture
leadership should conduct
themselves in such a manner.
