SGA Vice-President Elect

SGA President Elect

The past few weeks have been very
eventful for SGA as we prepare for
this weekend’s Daerilliams concert
and for Spring Waltz, and as we con—
tinue to discuss campus smoking is-
sues. It has also been a time to start
preparing for next year‘s SGA. Af-
ter an extensive application and in-
terview process, six of the seven
Cabinet and Committee Chair posi~
tions have been selected, and ape
proved by Joint Board. We thorr
oughly reviewed each applicant,
looking for several qualities that we
feel Cabinet and Committee Chairs
should possess. First, we looked for
an understanding of comrriittees. We
feel that. since committee leadership
is one of the main functions of all
positions, Cabinet members need to
be motivated and effective leaders.
Second, we looked for new and re-

SGA looks to the future

alistic ideas that will take the Cabi-
net positions and committees to new
levels and improve the existing strucr
ture. Third, the ability to communi-
cate well, especially in response to
both positive and negative feedback,
is vital for Cabinet members. Finally,
all approved Cabinet members pos-
sess some experience in son or in
other campus organizations. After
much deliberation. we selected the
following people to serve as next
year’s SGA Cabinet: Jessica

Jacobson ‘99—Assistanl Treasurer, '

Karen Rollhauser ‘98—Administra-
tive Coordinator, Brian Baltes ‘99—
AllACampus Events Programmer,
Jackie Hines ‘OO—Student Services
Coordinator, Laura Schwartz ‘987
Films Chair, and Paul Conn ‘997
Concerts Chair, in addition to
Jonathan Hjelm ‘98, who will as-
sume the position of Treasurer after
serving this year as Assistant Trea-
surer. We are all looking forward to
working together next year to serve
the Grinnell‘s student body.

The Student Services Coordinator
is an especially exciting position
since it combines the duties of the
Social Coordinator, including orga-
nization of the blood drive and book
sale, with some of the ACE
Programmer‘s duties, including the
organization of student initiatives.
This Cabinet position is new, and
therefore, has many possibilities.
Another position which is relatively
new is the Student Groups Liaison/
Publicity Coordinator. As this posi-
tion is as yet unﬁlled, we are re-open-
ing the application process. Duties
of the position include chairing the
Common Ground Committee and
writin g its newsletter. as well as pro
ducing the SGA handbook and regur
larly polling the campus on various
issues that are of concern to the cam-
pus. This is another position which
will continue to be shaped in the
coming year. If you are interested in
this Cabinet position, please pick up
an application in the SGA outer of-
ﬁce.

 

 

bAskIggy;

There‘s not much time left
kids. The day is drawing near. I
know you all know what I am talk-
ing about. Soon we'll no longer be
able to get interlibrary loan materi-
als. The day is upon us. You also
don’t have much time left to send
me questions and comments. Those
of you who said you would send me
things (Darcy) better get on it. I'm
sure some of you will have Waltz
related traumas to share. If I get
enough (more than two) next week
may be official “Waltz Related
Trauma“ week. Everyone, however,
is cordially invited to send their
thoughts and queries to box 10-14
or email ASKIGGY, Here are this
week‘s communiqués:

Dearest Iggyi . e. . . , . _ .t
I recently. heard [about a friend’who
sent some creative writing to one of
the fine publications we have on
campus for that purpose. This friend
had written an amusing piece pok-
ing fun at the stereotypical form of
poetry and I found the writing to be
witty and cute. Apparently the edi-
torial staff of the certain creative
writing publication did not find the
writing witty, cute, or even creative.
To my surprise (and I’m sure the sur-
prise of the author too) the creative
piece was edited somewhat ruth-
lessly and put in a packet along with
a transcript of the editorial staff dis-
cussing the work ending with the
comment “We don’t print crap," and
a poem written in the style of one of
the “Great" poets which ridiculed the
author‘s work. Numerous copies of
this packet were placed outside of
Quad and in the post office, if not
other locations too. This action

doesn’t make sense to me. Why did
the staff of a student publication
which prints creative work critique
a piece of writing for things such as
not being formal enough and for the
author‘s clever use of obviously in-
correct information? Everyone
knows Aristotle wrote the Poetic:
anyway. What was the point the edi-
torial staff was trying to make?
Should I write only about approved
topics in traditional styles? Should]
not send in my creative writing be
cause it might not be creative
enough? I think this certain edito—
rial staff acted in a completely disrer
spectful manner which showed a lack
of even a hint of class. Do you agree?
Sincerely,
Creatively Concerned

Hi Concerned,

The things on the mind of
an editorial staff are anyone’s guess.
Ithink you‘ll have to ask them what
their point was, I have no idea. It is
kind of uncomfortable to underesti-
mate how much of a sense of humor
an editorial staff has. Underestimat-
ing whether they have a shred of
class or not is, apparently, another
matter.

Dear Iggy,

Help! My friend (let’s just call
her Benny lawyers) can not stop
smiling. We’ve, tried to cure her of
this awful habit, but due to its infecr
tious nature, we have started develr
oping this habit too. What can I do
to help her and myself!

Yam-s truly,

At the movies...

Spring Waltz

Nick and Win are well aware that
there is no film called “Spring
Waltz," but it was included on the
purple “SGA films" ﬂyers—so we
thought a review was in order. Why
review Spring Waltz? There are two
reasons: first, if you haven’t noticed
already, the film reviews are slightly
on the unprofessional side, and we
figured that you
wouldn'tmiss our
weekly fantastical
column anyway
(and on that topic,
one big “thank
you" and two
sloppy kisses go
to our editor,
Matteo, for being
so supportive.)
Second, we feel that there are many
psychological implications in con-
junction with the fact that
Grinnellians look forward to Spring
Waltz as THE event of the semester.

First of all, a deﬁnition of Spring
Waltz: a bunch of college students
who are extraordinarily stuck in the
middle of nowhere decide to dress
in formal attire, get ridiculously
drunk, go to the Harris center to
“dance" amongst twelve hundred

obnoxious sweaty people, and try to

Why do we need

get laid. This seems a little strange
to us. Why? For one reason alone:
why do we need an excuse to get
drunk and/or laid? Do we feel bet-
ter about ourselves if we're merely
participants in a mass display of
drunken debauchery? To be honest
with you, we think there is some
tnith in that, although most likely,
twelve hundred Grinnell students
would adamantly disagree. What
ever the case may
be, there should
be NO excuse
needed. Who can
say if your two
ﬁlm critics will be
at the Harris cen—
ter to witness the
shameless array
of inebriated
Grinnellians, but
if we do choose to participate in the
circus, we certainly won‘t be using
the title “Spring Waltz” as an excuse.

Jerry McGuire

Jerry McGuire is the heartbreaking

story set in the 1500‘s about a celtic '

mouse and his struggle to preserve
his little vemiin life. Violently pur-
sued by the feline Tom Flannery, his
exrlover, Jerry must rely on his wits
to outsmart the ravenous and mania-
cal whiterfooted demon. The film is
based on the animated teleVlslon
show of the sixties, and it certainly
does justice to the classic series. In
the movie, we get more close and
personal with the emotional strife
between the characters. Tom‘s insa-
liable hunger for Jerry can only be
interpreted as a passionate, homo-
erotic, and at times, disturbingly per-
verse obsession for oneness of soul.
Jerry, stricken blind with his two
brothers in a freak chemical plant
accident, mns from the catunder the
shroud of darkness. His ﬂight from
Dublin is the only chance to escape
a torturous death, and perhaps even
more terrifying, an impossible love.
