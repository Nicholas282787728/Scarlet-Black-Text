Hi kids. So, have you sent me a let»
ter recently? Get on that by next
Tuesday, That’s box 1014 or email
ASKIGGY! Don’t slack now 0k?
You doth have all that many chances
left. Here are the illustrious letters:

Dear Iggy,

I have been under enormous stress
to write a letter for my friend's col-
umn, but I have been unable to think
of an appropriate problem. Can and
will you help me out ofmy dilemma?
If not, can you give me a good spam
recipei

Yours Truly.
Clueless

Hey Clueless,

I will not help you out of this di»
lemma! So there! As for a spam
recipe however, I’m sure I can be of
assistance. I had some great spam
hors d’oeuvres once which consisted
ofa fried slice of spam on a triscut
with an olive on top. Very delicious.
I have also had some spam stir fry
which was, well, not to my taste.
Actually it was putrid. Happy cook-
ing.

Dear Iggy:

Perhaps you can settle a debate be-
tween a friend and me. She says your

favorite color of toe-nail polish is sil-
ver. Isay its green. Who’s right?

sign me,
Perfectly Polished in Loose

Dearest Polished, ,

Being the fashion guru that I am
I‘d have to say that my favorite color
of toernaii polish is whatever
accessorizes best with my lip-gloss.
Silver or green are both good choices
as is navy blue.

Dear iggy,

i was raised Catholic. i have not
been to church for many moons now.
Can i still getpapal indulgences? or
could i make it up by corresponding
with a Tibetan monk? What if God
is a PC and i only know Macs?
~after bar night

Hello bar night,

Um, papal indulgences are a dime
a dozen these days. Get em while
they‘re hot. Correspondence with
Tibetan monks is always good or
people who wearleetan hats is usu-
ally good enough. ihave heard that
God is in fact Bill Gates so sell your
crappy old Mac before the second
coming or there will be trouble.
That’s the rumor anyway.

TO the editor

 

A Response to Sisk
‘As a concerned member of the fac~
ulty here at Grinnell College, and as
one who supports the College’s de
cision to dece t'f the Cam ’
Intefvdrsity “Christian Fellowship
(IVCF) chapter, I feel a certain obli-
gation to respond to charges leveled
against this decision in an article pub-
lished in the April 11 83113 by Grey
gory Sisk, an Associate Professor of
Law at Drake University. I believe
that Professor Sisk‘s charges derive
from a misunderstanding of the is-
sues involved in the controversy.
To begin, Professor Sisk accuses
Grinnell College ofhaving “become
the ﬁrst college in the country to dis-
qualify a student religious group as
a campus organization because the
group had the courage ofits convic-
tion" (italics mine). This simplc‘a
false characterization of what the
college did. The college did decide
to disqualify the IVCF, to be sure,
but not for having had the courage
of its convictions. IVCF itself had
established a group policy not to per~
mit into a leadership role any student
who did not share the group’s views
on such matters as homosexuality.
As I understand it the College felt
(rightly in my opinion) that in doing
so the IVCF was discriminating on
the basis of sexual orientation, Just
as the college would not extend ofﬁ-
cial recognition to any group that
made it a policy to disallow (say)
blacks from serving in the leadership
roles, so the college decided against
recognizing IVCF for its form of dis-
crimination. Is this tantamount to
disqualifying IVCF for the courage
of its members‘ convictions? Hardly.
After all, in order to comply with the
College’s anti-discrimination policy,
all that IVCF had to do was expunge
its discriminatory policy; but (and
this is the crucial point neglected by
Professor Sisk) individual IVCF
members could continue to votefor'
their leader: on the bum ofthe per-
sonal convictions, If individual
members felt that they would not
want a person who did not share e
their views on homosexuality to be
a leader, then they should have voted
against any such a person. If enough
agreed, then they would have lead
ers all of whom shared their views
on homosexuality! Thus it is absurd
to accuse the school of disqualify-
ing the IVCF for having the courage
of its convictions: members of IVCF
can have the courage of their con-
victions, so long as they do so in a
manner that conforms to the

College’s nondiscrimination clause
(such as by popular Vote).

Against this, Sisk denies that what
IVCF requires of its leaders is tanta-
mount to discrimination. Rather, he
explains, IVCF “requires only that its

‘ ‘lé'id'eTs‘afﬁmi’the biblical'teaching
that homosexual conduct is im»
moral." Sisk is correct about what
IVCF requires of its W0uld~be leada
ers. But there is a strong case to be
made that what IVCF requires of its
leaders does amount to discrimina-
tion, Sirk's clm'ms notwithstanding.
Consider a hypothetical group that
allowed blacks to serve as leaders,
but only on
condition
that the
b l a c k s
themselves
e n d o r s e d
the ofﬁcial
racist ideol»
ogy of the
group (in-
cluding the
View that
blacks are
racially in-
ferior to
w h i t e s ) .
Could such a group be defended on
the grounds that it did not discrimi-
nate against blacks, since blacks
were allowed into leadership roles
after all? Such a defense would be
disingenuous: while blacks would be
allowed, they would be allowed only
by accepting conditions that made
them denigrate themselves. This pre
cisely what IVCF would require of
would~bc gay candidates for leader
ship. The College has decidedijusV
tiftahly, in my opinion — that in plac.
ing such selfrdenlgrating conditions
an the gays inlctested in seerng in a
leadership role, IVCF’S official
policy is decidedly unfair to gays:
such a policy unfairly singles out gay
individuals interested in leadership
in IVCF and forces them to dcni grate
their very identities as a condition for
being able to serve as a leader. The
College’s that such a policy is unfair
to gay individuals is based on the
view that being gay is a core part of
a gay individuals identity, not some
thing that can be rejected without
damage when ever external circumr
stances require doing so.

This point about discrimination
suggest another confusion in Profes—
sor Sisk’s article. Sisk correctly de-
scribes thc issue at the core of the
IVCF controversy as “one of eligi-
bility for leadership of a religious
organization," Unfortunately, he

”,..the point is that no
one should be excluded
from competing on
equal terms for a
leadership position...0h
the basis of his or her
sexual orientation.”

then goes on to suggest that “a gay
activist. on campus has‘no more
‘right‘ to be selected as the leader of
an evangelical Christian organiza-
tion than does the IVCF have a
‘right‘ to be selected as the leader
of the Stonewall Coalition for gay
students" (italics mine). Here, Sisk’s
point is correct but perfectly irrelv
evam‘ to the controversy. So far as I
can tell no one here at Grinnell is
claiming that gay activists have a
right to be selected as the leaders of
IVCF: this would be as absurd as
insisting that gay activists have'a

~ right to win the athletic activities in

which they choose to participate.
Rather, the point is that no one
should be excluded from competing
on equal terms for a leadership po-
sition (or in athletics) on the basis
ofhis or her sexual orientation. And
this is a right that the College has
chosen to recognize. ‘
Finally,
there is one
last point
on which I
should like
to chal-
lenge Sisk,
as he makes
one final
accusation
which is di-
rectly re-
lated to his
research in
the areas of
freedom of
speech and thought. He writes:

Even in leadership [IVCF] does not
discriminate on the basis of sexual
orientation. It requires only that its
leaders afﬁnn the biblical teaching
that homosexual conduct is immoral.
By punishing this position, Grinnell
College has essentially declared that
this is an impermissible interpreta-
tion of the Bible.

Sisk's charge, that the College has
“declared an impermtssible interpre-
tation of the Bible," is based on his
failure to understand the basis for the
College’s decision to dccertify IVCF.
to the best of my knowledge, the
College as such takes no position on
what is a correct interpretation of the
Bible: the College as such isn’t in
that line of business. But the Col»
lege does take a position on campus-
wide non-discrimination: and the
College‘s position on this score does
have an implication for those who
we in the business ofinterpreting the
Bible (including IVCF). the
College's line is that no campus
group will be recognized by the Col-
lege if the group makes it ofﬁcial
policy to discriminate against people
on the basis of their “gender, race,
color, creed, national or ethnic on-
gin, disability, or sexual orientation"
(from the College’s Nondiscrimina—

tion Policy; italics mine). And this
is precisely what IVCF's interpreta-
tion of the Bible, does. Burio say
that this implies that the Cullege is
committed to the falsity of IVCF’s
interpretation on the Bible is simply
absurd: for the College is simply
saying that, whether or not IVCF'S
i: the correct interpretation of the
Bible, it is illegitimate to erect a (dis—
criminatory) group policy on the ba—
sis of that interpretation. Does this
constitute a restriction on freedom of
thought? Not at all: as I indicated

above, individual members of IVCF...
are not only free to think what they“

please, they are free to Vote as they
please. They are only required, as a
condition for ofﬁcial College recog-
nition, not to erect a policy which
would discriminate against persons
on the basis of sexual orientation.

I write as a concerned member of
the faculty here at Grinnell College
(and not as an ofﬁcial representative
of the College). When I see laypera
sons in my community here make
heartfelt yet uninformed accusations
against the College’s decision to de-
certify IVCF, I feel some responsi-
bility to stand up for what strikes me
asan imminentlyjust and courageous
decision on the College’s part. I feel
this responsibility all the more when
the false accusations come from a
Professor of Law, given the author-
ity of his title in the community at
large.

Yours,

Blood Drive
Discrimination?
Dear Editor,

I find it curious that this campus so
heartily promotes the Red Cross
Blood Drive, especially during Pride
Week. ROTC is no longer allowed
on campus because of the military‘s
discriminitory policy towards gays,
lesbians and bisexuals. IVCFlost it‘s
student group status for similar rea-
sons. However. we openly encour-
age the Red Cross to come to aim-
pus, even though they disallow the
giving ofblood by men who have had
sex with men or individuals who
have had sex with men who have had
sex with men. Their argument is
these individuals are members of a
“high risk group“ for HIV. There is
no such thing as a high risk group,
only high risk activities. A man who
has practiced safer sex with one man
who was a Virgin and non-IV drug
user is not able to donate blood.
However, a man who has had hetero»
sexual sex (safe or otherwise) is able
to donate blood. Do we only sup»
port discriminatory institutions on
this campus if they seem more so
cially beneﬁcial than the military or

a christian organization?

Sincerely yours,
Jamie L. Heckert '97

Smoker Speaks Out

I would like to comment on the
“lack of tolerance" shown by smok»
ers to the GAS? signs recently put
up and taken down On south cam»
pus. First of all, the displayed lack
of tolerance was in direct reaction
to the nonsmokers’ lack of tolerance
on this campus towards a personal
lifestyle choice. I understand that
cigarette smoke infringes on your
personal space and may cause you
to feel uncomfortable. However, if
you are so concerned with your
health, react against something more
dangerous that affects all of us ev-
ery day. Every day there are factoV
ries around us spilling chemicals in
our air much more detrimental than
second-hand smoke. The food in the
dining halls is very unhealthy. Not
to mention that you have no choice
to or chance ofavoiding it unless you
live off-campus. Iowa has the worst
water in the nation. Poweshiek
County has the worst water in Iowa.
We all have to drink this every day.
Please put your sign writing and
SGA whining efforts into something
we can all appreciate. Secondly,
smoking at Grinnell is one ofthe few
activities that soothe students' angst
created by living in the middle of
nowhere. Cries from groups like
GASP create more problems in the
lives of sensitive souls who just want
ﬁve to eight minutes of smooth,
smoke»ﬁlled escape. And please
don't forget that smoking helps unite
ﬁrst-years and older smokers in the
beginning of each new school year.
Do you really want the guilt of
knowing that you are deterring the
socialization of new students? I
would then like to comment on your
unacknowledgement of the anti-
GASP Signs. You must admit they
were rather funny and clover, Fi-
nally, I would like to explain that the
GAS? signs were rather extreme.
I’m very sorry that you cannotenter
the south campus loggia or attend a
Gardner party or any other activity
mentioned on one particular sign.
However, maybe you-should sit
down and question ifyou really want
to congregate in places frequented
by foul, smoking individuals. Please
try to understand we really are very
isolated and have no other choice
than to just get along. There are
many important issues on this cam-
pus that both smokers and non-
smokers could unite forced and over-
come. Nevertheless, your incessant
whining puts many smokers at an
apathetic level to whatever you have
to say. Many cries of persecution
are left unheard because of the con»
stant debate over smokng. If you
really have a problem, I suggest

walling yourselfup in yourroom and
sealing the doors and windows so no
smoke can come in and you can’t
come out. Or transfer to UC DaVis.

The Goat Strikes Back
Editors of the S&B:

Last week’s letter to the editor from
Genevieve Dawson not only war-
rants. but requires a response on my
part. My judgment and character
have been questioned and I feel the
need to defend myself. ’

For the whole incident I am eter-
nally sorry. It is true that the goat,
whose name incidentally is Simely,
never did anything to hurt me and I
take full responsibility for my nee
lions. You all know,the story of what
happened that night and there is only
one additional fact which I can add.
When I was very young, I was at a
petting 200 with my family. For"
some reason I decided that the goat
was my favorite animal there and
that I needed to pet it really hard to
show it how much I liked it. I can
still remember what this goat looked
like With its beady eyes and silly
unchanging grin. Well, as you can
guess, the goat wasn’t as fond of me
as I was of it, and it decided that it

_wanted no part of this little boy pets

ting it, The bite wasn‘t particularly
hard, but then again it didn’t have to
be, I got the message. Now, I know
this story is no excuse for my actions,
and that Simely is not the goat that
bit me at the petting zoo, but when
he started grinning at me and star-
ing with those unflinching
eyes...well, I only wish Iwas a stronr
ger person. .

The letter from Dawson only goes
to show the types of responses I have
had to deal with since the 5&8 ﬁrst
published the story, Her idea that
there was some sort of coverup is
absurd, this is no Kennedy assassi-
nation, or X~Files episode, She finds
it difﬁcult to believe that Simely was
able to give me stitches, an indica-
tion that she has had little experience
With goats. From experience I know
that they are very strong animals.
Dawson also brings up the possibil-
ity ofa “sexual struggle," an idea so
far fetched, I feel no need to even
comment. If she wants to ﬁnd a
cover»up she needs to look else-
where, rhis incident is very straight-
forward.

This response gives me the oppor-
tunity to ask the community as a
whole to move on. Are there no
more important issues which require
our attention? It is true that we are
a campus where free and open den
hate is important, but is this issue
deserving of further discussion? I
offer that it is not.
