US. Reports First Decline in New AIDS Cases
ATLANTA-The total number of Americans newly
diagnosed wrth AIDS last year dropped 6 percent from
the year before, the first decline in the history of the
epidemic, federal health officials said Thursday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
said the number of new AIDS cases reported among
teenagers and adults fell to 56,730 in 1996 from 60,620
in 1995. The number ofnew AIDS cases rosc an avcragc
of2 percent a year between 1992 and [995.

Between 1995 and 1996. the number of ncw AIDS cases
fell 13 percent among whites, 5 percent among Hispanics
and was little changed among Blacks,
Newly-diagnosed AIDS cases declined 12 percent in the
West, 10 percent in the Midwest, and 8 pcrcelit in the
Northeast. Thcy fell only 1 percent in the South, the CDC
said.

“Our efforts in prevention and treatment are allowing
more people to live free of HIV while we are extending
the healthy lives ofthose who are infected," said Health
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala,

New AIDS cases declined 15 percent among white gay
and bisexual men, The total incidence rate of AIDS
among heterosexuals, however, rose in 1996, increasing
11 percent among men and 7 percent among women,
the CDC said.

The biggest percentage increases occurred among Blacks
and Latinos infected through heterosexual contact. the
agency said. Of those infected in this way, there was a
19 percent increase in new AIDS cases among Black
men, a 13 percent increase among Latino men and a 12
percent increase among black women,

The CDC said combination drug therapies, including
protease inhibitors. are delaying the onset of AIDS
among people infected With the human
immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) and are helping people
who have developed AIDS to live longer.

As a result, the number of people living with AIDS rose
to 235,470 in 1996, an 11 percent increase from a year
earlier.

The CDC reported last week that deaths from AIDS fell
by one-fourth in 1996. It said the disease was no longer
the leading cause of death for people between the ages
of 25 and 44,

China Reconfigures its Economy

BEIJING - In aclear victory for China's Presidentliang
Ziemin. the Communist Party Congress endorsed his plans
to dismantle large chunks ofstate industry and sidelined
his main political rivals.

By a unanimous Show of hands in Beijing's Great Hall
of the People, the 2,074 delegates to thc 15th party cone
gross enshrined the capitalist-style theories of former
paramount leader Deng Xioping in the party‘s constitu»
tion.

They approved Jiang's report to the congress that set
out far-reaching plans to sell governmanun enterprises
and let others sink or swrm in a “survival of the fittest”
struggle.

A new central committee elected at the ﬁverycarly cone
gress did not include Qiao Shi, the 72ryearrold chairr
man of China’s parliament who is regarded as .liang’s
chief opponent. Also dumped were general Ltti Huaqtng,
like Qiao a member ofthe all—powerful Politburo stand-
ing committee, and Yang Baibing, a mcmbcr of the per
litburo who led an abortive power play in 1992.

All three will automatically lose their seats in thc polit-
buro. The ofﬁcial explanation was that they had been
retired on grounds of old age,

Western diplomats said their abrupt departures were or-
chestrated by Jiang, and indicated he had consolidated
his grip on power since the death last February of his
mentor Deng.

Some 370.000 govemment-mn companies have become
a huge drain on government coffers and threaten ﬁnanr
cial instability.

Grinnell program broadens curriculum

Minority-Scholars-in-Residence promote diverse academic opportunities

BY CHRIS NEARY
Staff Writer

Over the past six years the Minority
Scholarsnn-Residence program has
brought some of the finest professors in
their ﬁelds to Grinnell College.

This semester two minority scholars in
residence arc on the Grinncll campus.
with two more schedulcd to come in the
spring.

Professor Charles Payne is currently
teaching in the Sociology department
while Professor LeAnnc Howc is teach—
ing in the American Studies department.

Professor Howe, a Choctaw woman,
is teaching both “Writing in America" and
"Native American Literature and Culr
lure." She is an author and a playwright.
Her publications include fiction and non—
fiction articles, two collections of short
fiction, as well as published plays.

Hcr plays have been produced in Iowa,
the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles,
and at the National Museum ofthe AmEl'l'
can Indian in New York City, Professor
Howe has taught at Carleton College and
team taught at the University oflowa. She
also spent five years as one of the very
few Native Americans on Wall Street.

Grinnell was introduced to Professor
Howe last year when she gave a convo-
cation speech in which she read one of
her own stories depicting the many prob—
lems of Native Americans in mainstream
society,

On September 13 and 14, Professor
Howc, in accordance with her coursc,
took six Grinnell students to the “Moore

‘hopes that \vliat is

 

ing Ground", a Na.
live American cone
fcrencc which was
held at the DjArcy
McNicklc Center for
American Indian
History at the
Newbcrry Library in
Chicago.

Through the trip
to the conference
Professor Howe

just ”curriculum" in
the classroom can
become real. “The
problem with teach-
ing Native American

that Native Anlcrir
cans are in many
ways invisible in
American society,"

she’sald. “Going to something ltkc the
conference IS important because it gives

students real experience, it makes the
course more than just intellectual. The
conference was wonderful, it had poetry,
music and some of the brightest people
in Native American studies."

Professor Howe believes that without
the Minority-Scholar-in-Rcsidencc pro
gram Grinnell students would not have
had the chance to go to the conference.
“It’s possible because I'm plugged into
the Native American academic conimu-
'nity otherwise known as the ‘Moccasin

Last week, Rabbi Deborah Brin ac-
cepted Grinnell College's offer to become
associate chaplain of the collcgc. Begin»
ning in late October, she will assistChap-
lain Dcan'na Shorb with programming of
the religious aspects of the college. She
will also be an advisor to the Jewish Stu»
dent OlganlLt’lIlOn ChaluIZim,

Rabbi Brin will not be the ﬁrst rabbt
on campus. The college has employed
three previous rabbis,

Brin has been working in communi-
ties for the past twelve years as a congre-
gational rabbi, a Hospice chaplain and she
ltas done interfaith wotk. As a congregate
tlonal rabbi, she ran workshops in nature
and music. As a Hospice chaplain, she
worked intimatcly for years with termi-
nally ill patients,

As pztrt ofher duties as associate chap-
lain, Brin will work with Shorb in arrang-
mg lectures. worship and in counseling
students. She will also work with Shorb
m the Chaplain‘s Interfaith Association,
which Shorb started last year to ﬁnd out
how various campus religious groups fclt
about issues.

The Chaplain’s Interfaith Association
facilitates study breaks led by religious
organization leaders on campus, which
occur in late October or November. The
Interfaith Association also shows intcr-
faith ﬁlms and organizes regular spiritu-
ality gatherings to discuss religious issues,

hclp‘to broaden the aciidcmy."

Associate Dean Helen Scott. chair of
the program, regards Professor Howe‘s
class trip to the conference as an example
of what the Minority Scholar-in-Resi-
dence program brings to the college. "She
[Professor Howe] really enriches our cure
riculuni and adds things we could not have
without her,“ Dean Scott said, “By being
at Grinnell she shares her own awareness
of Native American culture and politics
with our students."

On September 1 l,just two days before
Professor Howe left for Chicago, Charles

Payne, another Minon'ty Scholar in Resin
dence spoke at convocation, addressing
the tough problems of inner city public
schools. “I have tried for years to under
stand why so few reforms in the inner
city public school system work," he said.
“I was pointing out that the one reason
for this failure is that the social infrastruc
ture ofthose schools is so damaged, the
central problem being a lack oftrust. In
most cases policy makers don’t under-
stand that."

Professor Payne has considerable exA
penise in the area of urban school reform.
Beginning with his first contact with urr
ban schools while at college, Professor
Payne has dedicated much of his life to
trying to improve city schools.

Currently he is working on ways to
improve both math and science educa-
tion in Chicago schools as well asdoing
research in Comer project, a project that
tries to improve the ways adults work
with one another in inner city schools.

Professor Payne taught at Northwest-
ern, Haverford and Southern University,
and he worked for four years at a youth
center near Newark.

While at Grinnell, Professor Payne is
teaching a two-credit course on the Civil
Rights Movement in Mississippi during
the 1960's.

Next semester, the English department
hopes to bring African American writer
Donna Harper to Grinnell to teach a
course that will feature the work of writer
Langston Hughes. The religious studies
department is also inviting a scholar to

Iowa passes stricter drinking laws

BY PHOEBE SILAG
'Staff Writer

The Iowa legislature, in an effort to
curb underage alcollol use, has placed
stiffer penalties on those who serve drink~
ers younger than twentyvone. The law,
which went into affect in April 1997, me
cludcs a $1500 fine that can be imposed
on both the person serving the alcohol and
on the owner ofthe establishment.

According to Jim Sadler ‘88. owner of
Jiilibo’s and the Down Under Pub, the old
law was a “slap on the wrist" for those
serving alcohol to 197 to 20—year-olds,
“There was no penalty for the bar and a
$50 penalty for the bartender," he said.

Both Sadlcr and Jeff Phelps, owner of
The Wine Cellar, have tightened their
policies rclated to selling alcohol in re-
spotise to the new laws.“We card a lot
harder," Sadler said. “We won‘t serve

someone a beer unless we see their ID."

Phelps concurred. “We require people
to bring their ID: every'Lime they buy
alcohol, whether or not we know them,"
he said. “In a group, everyone who is
involved in the selection of what to buy
will get carded. We card everyone who
exchanges money in the store. We will
also conﬁscate false identification. as the
law enables us todo so.”

Although the policy ofThe Wine Cel-
lar complies “fully with law as it was
written in April," Phelps believes that
“there are some real problems with the
way it was written."

“The person who walks into a bar to
buy alcohol is the person who should be
handled the hardest,“ he said. “No mat-
ter what I tell clerks, no matter how much
I train them, ifthey sell alcohol to a mi-
nor and they get caught, they pay a hefty

Students and fire fighters are scheduled to perform a training excercise

BY COUIUNEY SHERWOOD
News/ Features Editor

On Monday, September 22, the Grin-
ncll Fire Department will conducta train—
ing drill in Younkcr Hall from 6:30pm
until 8:00pm,

The drill is part of a collaborative efr
fort mounted “for the college, for us and
for the ambulances," said fire department
Captain Patrick White.

The entire drill will be filmed to tea
place an outdated training video, In ad-
dition, Grinnell college will work with the
fire department to evaluate current fire
safety procedures

"This Will involve the use ofnonrharmr
t‘ul theater smokc in the hallways and one
trance areas Residence Life Coordinar
tor forYounkcr and Smith Halls Stephanie
Preston announced.

Captain White will lead the lirst team
of ﬁre lighters to enter the building. "We
will lay dry hose from the hydrant to the
truck and in the building.“ he said. “We'll
sweep through the building to evacuate
people."

"Four or five students Will be walking
wounded" said Preston. She explained
that student staff members volunteered to
play ii spccial role in the drill. “They‘ll
be stumbling about as though suffering
from smoke inhalation," she said.

Iii addition, several voluntccrs will be
evacuated according to scarch and rescue

techniques. “We‘re going to have at least
three or four serious injuries taken on a
stretcher to the ambulances," said Capt.
White.

Preston made it clear that although fire
fighters will be evacuating individual
rooms, Younker residents arc not required
to participate in the drill. “If you choose
not to participate," she said, "we ask that
you make arrangements to leave Younkcr
halt between the given limes " In addir
tion, the fire department has no desire to
infringe upon students' privacy. "If you
do not feel comfortable with your door
being opened by firc fighters. plcasc lock
it during this time and your room Will not
be disturbed," Preston told residents.

Following the drill, the college and the
ﬁre department "arc going to go over what
we did and what wc could do better in an
emergency, “ Capt. White said.

Monday's drill comes tn the wakc of
recent problems with the lit-c dctcctitin
system in Youtlkcr,

Several ttmcs fire alarms woke SlUv
dents up as early as 2 and 5am "Basi—
cally, we had an over scnsttlvc lire alarm
on the second floor that had a tendency
to go off when people were boi rig wa-
ter," Sara Jcnscii, Studcnt Advisor for the
basement and ﬁrst floor ofNortliYoiinkci-
“It was annoying."

A: a result ot‘tlie concerns about fire
safety that this sparked, drills were held
during the day to look for weak spots in

 

fire detection sys-
tems. RLCs found
that it was difﬁcult to
hear alarms from
within dorm rooms
when doors and Wine
dows were closed. .

Less than a week
later, smoked filled
the halls of the ﬁrst
floor of Younkcr as
the result of an acci-
dent in the kitchen
“At about three in the
morning on Septcma

“someonc but the ini-
crowavc on fora very
long period of time
and it tncllcd and
smoked a lot." Dcr
spite lllc smoke. no
alarms were trig~
gcrcd,

students are WDl‘I'ch.
“First. there has been
some concern that

fire alarms from their rooms. Second,
when more actually was a lot of smoke
due to a burning microwave, the fire
alarms didn't go on Finally, since we've
had so many lire niiinnt, people are get»
ting conditioned and don‘t want to re-

spond to them anymore."

Prestoi-i and Jensen both expressed
hope that the ﬁre department‘s presence
on Monday will assist in Younker’s ef»
fort to improve safety, especially in light
of recent events.
