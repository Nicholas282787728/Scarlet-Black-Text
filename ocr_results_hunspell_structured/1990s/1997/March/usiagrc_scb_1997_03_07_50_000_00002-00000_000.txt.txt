In performance, members of
Chanticleer always make it clear that
they are notjust men of the Renais—
sance. This lZ-voice a cappella en-
semble derived its name from the
clear-singing rooster in Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales, but it specializes
in more than Renaissance music.
This evening at 8 pm. in Herrick,
Chanticleer will perform a diverse
repertoire that includes not just Re-
naissance music, but gospel, folk
songs from around the world, and
“venturesome new music."

Chanticleer has been highly
praised across the country and
abroad for its “transfixing” claiity or
expression and its
“seamless" blend
ofvocal color, En—
thusiastic audi-
ences and devoted
fans have eiicoure
aged the group to
make regular visits
back to Europe and
Asia as well as to
venues across the
United States.

Although the
San Francisco
based group
started out in 1978
as a vocal ensemble specializing in
Renaissance inusm, since then it has
found a diverse repertoire more in
keeping wtth llS style. Louis Botto,
the founder and now artistic director
of the group, said, “We like a lot of
verve and a lively manner, rather than
the dusty, respectful manner of an
antique."

in some ways, perrorining a vari~
ety of music has translated into
Chanticleer's excellence as a whole
and imbued its Renaissance selec-
tions With life. “I felt the guys
needed to have a direct relationship
with the audience in everything we
did," Botto said. "They needed to
be doing folk songs, barbershop
quartets and medleys, so they could
take that back to Renaissance ll'luSlC,
Ididn't want Renaissance music to
be stodgy and dusty, I wanted it to
be something living " Ferrel Rose.

tee effort to bring Chanticleer to
Griniiell, admired the group's unique
rendering of classical vocal music.
"[The group is] very interested in
conveying to the audience how alive
these older traditions are."

Chanticleeer's uliique blend of
sacred and secular, classical and con-
temporary works is not the only thing
that sets it apart. The group includes
five countei'teiiors who can sing alto
or soprano, making it possible forihe
all-male group to split into fourepart
hannoriy Together with the three
tenors, two baritones, and two
basses, the group creates a sound that
blends “perfectly" while at the same
time allowing each voice to be indie
vidunl and independent.

Chanticleer
also proves capti»
vating on stage. If
you’re expecting
a serious, slightly
reserved choir
conducted by a
sophisticated div
rector, Chanti»
cleer refuses to fit
the mode. “This
is not a choir in
which one person
stands in front and
dictates the
pieceiwe each
have a pan in shaping it," Botto said,
On top of that. music critics describe
the members as “very personable, not
only as a body of artists but as indi
viduals, introducing their songs with
some well-chosen andoften very
funny lincs "

How does the group live up to its
name and reputation? Members

iequircs some finely-developed in-
terpersonal skills, as the members
themselves acknowledge. Chanti-

group's music director. said, “We’re

were traveling around the country in

model for the armed forces."

focusmg their tired eyes on the spot
on the wall or they can move their
way over to Herrick Chapel and treat
their mind to the comforting classi-
cal sounds of Beethoven.

This Sunday at 2:00 PM the Grine
nell Symphony Orchestra will be
performing in Herrick Chapel, in
what conductor Douglas Diamond
predicted could very well be “one of
the most satisfying orchestral con-
certs by the home-grown ensemble
the Grinnell community has had oce
casion to hear
recently." In
addition to the
caliber of “the
collective facil-
ity of the GSO”
the music can
stand on its own
as according to
GSO member
and marimbist
Natalie Baggs.
“Beethoven’s
5th is quite pos-
sibly the most
famous piece
ever written,”
The repertoire for this weekend will
be Program Allegretto from
Beethoven’s Symphony No.7 and
Beethoven’s symphony No.5 played
in its entirety. The Allegretto has
been called by Diamond,
“unarguably one ofthe most famous
symphonic movements ever writ-
ten," and concurred wtth Baggs de-
scribing the Symphony No.5 as “per-
haps the single most famous classi-
cal piece, ever written."

Our popular culture crazed minds
may have lost sight of the relevance
and importance of classical tunes to
ourevery day life. Diamond in remi-
nisccncc talks of how most of us
grew up hearing the sounds of these

music
lovers. ..

famous pieces, “on the Saturday
morning cartoons, on commercials.
In pop arrangements, disco arrange
ments, easy listening arrangements,
band arrangements, you name it,"
This “greatest hits affair" that will
performed is both a time for people
to escape the Sunday ‘have work the
next day' fever and allow the GSO
to highlight its rapid development as
an orchestra. Diamond described
how, “the GSO has bumped up sev-
cral notches in the last few months;
the group is beginning to play, and
to sound, like a real orchestra." DIle
mond also talks about the challenge
that these pieces present the orches-
tra with as they are “looking for mu-
sic with which to elevate the quality
of their orchestral playing.” GSO
member Rachael Green says the
“only thing I don’t really like, is
hanging out on high A’s for about 25
measures, but] do
like the chair

The challenge
for Disco geeers

But if people get
out of bed and
wander over to
Herrick, it is cere
tain to please “the
most guneshy
classical novices
to the most die-
hard aficionae
dos." As Diae
mond said, in recognizance of the
hangover of Disco, “for those music
lovers who ﬁnd themselves ambula-
tory on Sunday afternoon, this con»
cert should prove well worth their
time," This concert is open to all in
the community, regardless of Disco
attendance. After all as Diamond
says, the goal of GSO is to ”develop
a large and a steady audience for
these concerts,” While the parties
may seem to be overwhelming the
beats of the campus this weekend, the
GSO will transform people‘s world
into the world of Beethoven, from the
craziness of the lights and dancing
tunes into the beauty ofclassical mu-

is pretty androgynous, but a little bit
ofsexuality creeps into the dynamic
between Faustus and Mephistophilis.
[didn‘t cut myself off from that, but
the scenes are still true to the text.
“It is the most interesting role that
I've ever played at Grinnell," she
continued. “People have a lot of
ideas about how a devil should be. I
have been trying to get a handle on
the language and the magnitude of
the character and to still keep it real
and believable What's really cool
is that Sandy likes to have a lot of
input from the actors." .

According to Rich, rehearsing has
been “a really good process. When
Sandy is directing, you know it Will
be a collective process, I like that a
lot. I can bring a lot ofinput into the
character, and Sandy will shape it as
he sees it."

“It’s more of an ensemble work,"
stage manager Michael Gonzalez
said. “We worked with
improvisation and different
movement techniques."

The play also includes a group of
actors who remain on stage
throughout the performance.

“I cast a troupe of actors who play
the devtl's troupe," Moffctt said,
“They perform scenes for
Mephistophilis, Lucifer, and
Beelzebub, the main representatives

of hell. They are condemned souls
lurking in the background, waiting
for people to slip up." The devil's
troupe will wear black masks on their
faces during the performance, and,
according to Moffett, they Wlli wear
“rather unique costumes

“We rely on costumes as the main
visual aspect of the show,” Moffett
said, “The costumes are very
elaborate, and the scenery and lights
are austere and minimal. There is not
alot ofcolor in the lighting, and there
are not a lot of light gimmicks. The
lightingissubtlycomplex Thelights
and the sparse, stark images in the
set play off each other very well."
“We didn't want the performance to
be showy or overdone," Bergl said,
“We wanted to make the pcrformance
powerful without showy delivery or
special effects."

According to Moffett, one of the
challenges of the pert’omianee was
“making the devtl supernatural
wtthout making it a magic show. In
the play, hell is frightening but not
too different from the world where
we exist. Once you lose your soul,
you are in hell wherever you are."
“Sometimes people view Elizabethan
plays as inaccessible or antiquated,"
Bergl said. “This play is very true to
the text, but I think it is accessible to
a modern audience as well."

Romeo and Juliet
may be worth seeing

BY KURT ORZECK
Arts Cerditor

The Films Committee has really
done it this time, folks. Tonight.
prepare yourself for quite the oce
casmn: the arrival of Romeo and
Juliet on campus, starring Leonardo
DiCaprio (The Basketball Diaries)
and Claire Danes (Little Women).
A month or two ago, the film com-
pleted its theater~run. Without
doubt, Romeo and Julie! is one of
the most recent ﬁlms we've been
able to get on campus this semcs»
ter.

Well, something must be happene
ing with film adaptions these days,
because this film has quite an in-
teresting twtst. Picture this: a
movte that almost perfectly duplie
cates thc Shakespearean dialect
proposed in the original play. but
is tempered Willi a 90’s ﬂavor. In
this version, the story takes place
in a city, the war between the
Capulets and Montagues is essen-
tially over control of the Clly, and
all tlte swords from the play are
magically transformed into guns.
Also, the creators ofthis film turned
Mercutio into an ostentatious ho-
mosexual,

Obviously, many tiaws arise
whenever someone tries to adapt a
classic work into a modem produc-
tion For example, firearm rcsltlc-
tions are obsolete, neither Romeo
nor Juliet seem to be participating
in any sort ofacademic schooling,

and Juliet's parents essentially pre-ar—
range her marriagc. But that‘s all
right. We can look beyond those
glitches, right?

Well, maybe. Aside from the con-
tradictions, the film also utilizes an in-
tcresting directing technique. Cape
tions appear at the beginning of the
film to identify the characters, the
camera races sporadically in different
directions during ﬁght scenes, and
face-offs between gangs ofMontagues
and Capulets are frequented by rac-
ing camera shots and intense close-
ups.

To summarize, what we have so far
in Romeo and Juliet is a skewed, cone
fused movie. But two elements ofthe
film helps clean up some of tile mess:
Romeo and Juliet. As a half-admirer
ofboth Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire
Dancs’s acting abilities, it's refreshe
ing to see two of Hollywood's most
“cutting edge" young stars come to-
gether and put on fine performances.
Though DiCaprio's performance isn't
nearly as raw and captivating as his
performance in Diaries, and Danes's
credibility not as superior as in the
Shortelived |.v. Show My So-Called
Life, seeing these two ﬁne young ac-
tors act together is a privilege,

All in all, a decent film, If you're
trying to prioritize your movie con-
sumption this weekend, I’d recom-
mend seeing stia/i or The African
Queen first. Still, if you have the
chance, you may want to check out
this recent film,
