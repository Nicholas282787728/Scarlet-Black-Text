Definitive guide to dining in Grinnell
For good food, you need only know where to look

By Andy Brooks & Sarah Piltch

JD’s

“Upscale. upstairs, uptown" is the new slogan for JD’s. Gone are the
leftist political wall hangings and nude murals. Instead you will find misty
pastels and reﬂective surfaces. The guilt is gone. The dining experience has
shifted from a weighty sermon in the catacombs of the 60's to a clear
summer‘s day in the meadow of the early 80’s. Also reminiscent ofthe Reagan
era are the prices: we went for a drink, and ended up spending a consider-
able excess. The appetizers were tasty. the service professional and courte-
ous. The bloody mary was diligently prepared, Lunches you will ﬁnd more
reasonably priced on a student budget, but dinner IS a pricey affair. JD’s has
afew welcome additions to the vegetarian options around town, including a
tasty grilled marinated vegetable sandwich for lunch. Overall, JD’s is u please
ant semi- gourmet restaurant.

The Back Alley Deli

When you order a sub at the Back Alley Deli. Dave spreads a mysterious
green substance on the bread before closing the sandwich. When cornered
at a social event, one of the Deli workers released information regarding the
greeri sauce. We learned that the secret was large quantities of ﬁnely ground
herbs and olive oil. The herbs contribute to'the quality ofDave's sandwiches,
but other factors also come into play. For example, the quality of meats and
cheeses is exemplary, leading to an overwhelmingly pleasurable sandwich
experience. Dave’s famous chili is another noteworthy menu item. Vegetar-
ians go for the veggie sandwich.

Cafe Phoenix
Borne from the ashes ofthe Last Egyptian, the Cafe‘ Phoenix has earned
its reputation as Grinnell's ﬁnest and most intimate restaurant. A gourmet
Mediterranean menu is sure to please meat eaters. vegetanans, and vegans
alike. The food is consistently prepared well, and served graciously in an
pleasant renovated Victorian house, The Beef and Tuna de Burgo are of
particularly superior quality. and the spinach pastry is
divine. Kama] Hammouda, the proprietor, prepares all
of the main dishes himself to ensure quality. When or»
dering wine, consider the Mediterranean Red. which is
an excellent inexpensive table wine. Expect to be sure
rounded by distinguished professors, administration
members. and students while dining at the Phoenix. The
Phoenix has just opened an after-hours bar to serve cof-
fee, beer‘, and wine until midnight. The coffee bar opens
at seven am, Soon, a smoking lounge will open upstairs.
Prices are reasonable for gourmet quality food. In addi-
tion. the Phoenix offers some dinner items that are prior (1
under ten dollars.

Jimbo’s

This is a college pizzajoint. Whether you’re at home. lounging at the bar
with a beer in your hand. or sitting at a booth with your friends, Jimbo's
menu offers a variety of Mexican and American food to satisfy the college
appetite, The food is not substantial, but it is ﬁlling and good to eat while
drinking beer. Iimbo's offers a good alternative to the Pub scene. The pizza
is classic, and is offered in all varieties, Recommended is the Wrigley pizza
with spinach and fresh tomato: 3 more gourmet option, While eating at
Jimbo‘s, you may encounter a harried staff who might forget your order.
But this aside, Jimbo’s is prototypical pizza place, with a good bar, and free
chips and salsa, run by an alum, Jimbo.

one might view the
meal, the subject, the
self and the other.

The Depot

Occupying perhaps the most elegant environment, the Depot offers de»
cent steak and Midwestern cuisine. Expect bountiful quantities and an at-
tentive staff. Located In the former train station, the high point of any meal
is punctuated by the rumblings of a passing
train, accompanied by the ritualized ringing of
a little bell by the wait staff. The train forms a
hermeneutic discurSive lens, through which one
might View the meal, the subject, the self and

Or not. To be honest, the food is difﬁcult to
romanticize, Vegetarians should not expect to
be eating during the meal. For carnivores, there
is some hope, The steaks are well prepared, but

here. To end on an upbeat note. the bar staff is
quite pleasant, and the martinis embody temp-
tation

Kelcy’s
If you, at any point in your Grinnell experience, want to form a concep-
tion ofplace, eat here. You will not be surrounded by people who hail from
Connecticut and Kansas City, but by the people who work and live in this

region. Although the crowd is mostly older, so is the actual population of

this region. Kelcy's steaks are reasonable and nicely spiced. Bread arrives at
the table couched in a small clay ﬂower pot. The environmental motif is
ﬂoral; there are no windows. Connection to Grinnell College is, for an hour,
severely limited. Do not expect anything fancy; but then why would you?
Kelcy’s has no pretensions of being other than it is.

we‘re in Iowa. Well cooked steaks are the norm -

Pagliai’s

Pag’s thin crust pizza is worthy of note, Grinnell‘s young families
can be observed in this establishment. Pag's runs like a finely tuned
machine. Brian Pagliai, the proprietor, has other restaurants outside of
Grinnell because he knows how to run them, Plan for timely service.
consistently decent pizza, and chilled beer mugs. It’s a tad expensive,
but you get what you pay for. Environmentally, Pag's is not intimate,
but it is clean and tidy.

The Longhorn

This dive used to be the college drinking hole. Two years ago, some
one renovated the place and stole its charm. Since then, college stue
dents have all but forgotten about the Longhorn. The Longhorn is one
of the few restaurants around that will serve a bloody mary with breakr
fast at 6 am. Breakfasts are good, but they are only served until 11 am.
It is at this point that we are going to discuss the fact that this town does
not have a restaurant that serves breakfast after 11 am. There‘s a place
to get a cup of coffee on Sunday afternoon: Pizza Hut. The question '
remains: ‘What is the Longhorn?’

China Sea

Located west (given our limited four square block area of living)
from the college onroth, you.will ﬁnd the ‘ ., ”not hell, .
Recommended is the Bean Curd'with Gar in au , and he larg and,
tasty Vegetable Spring Rolls. The lunch buffet 15 inexpensive, and delie
cious if you have transport, Of course. they do deliver for orders over
$20, Avoid the Sweet and Sour Pork at all costs, “Everytime I go in
there I order the Sweet and Sour Pork, and every time I hate it. [just
keep ordering it because it has a nice name" said Dustin Key ‘97.
