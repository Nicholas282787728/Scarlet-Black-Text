Orr o

A campus community in crisis

BY DARRYL ROBERTS

Today we mourn for the Grinnell
College student who was the victim
of one the most unspeakable acts of
brutality imaginable against a human
being; we mourn for the countless
other victims of rape and sexual as-
sault who must live with scars that
even time cannot heal: and we also
mourn for the family members, loved
ones and friends ofrapc victims who
must live with the piercing reality
that they were not able to prevent a
rape from occurring against someone
whom they love and care for.

What is important is not the idenr
tity of the person who was the vic-
tim ofrape on this campus. What is
important, however, is what we as
students, faculty and administrators
are going to do to address this issue
and ensure that Grinnell College be
comes a place where men and
women have adequate resources and
suppon to protect thelnselves against
individuals who pose a threat to their
safety and survival.

As a first step, we must acknowls
edge the overwhelming fear and
anxiety that women must live with
from day-to-day in a milieu where
few men respect their human dignity
and self»worth. No woman should
have to live each day with the threat
of being attacked at any moment by
an aggressor. No women should be
asked to live in an environment that
expects them to depend on men for
protection and/or inadequate re-
sources to ensure their safety and
survival.

No matter how mucll this commu-

nity wants to accept this, the recent
illcidentreveals students’ vulnerabil-
ity to crime and violence on this came
pus. Unfortunately, Grinnell is ilot
the utopia or safe or insular environ-
ment which itpromises to be to most
of its students; it is a pseudo utopia
whose existence is as much threats
erred by violence and crime as is the
larger society. However, when this
institution sees itself in isolation to
the outside world, it risks the danger
ofperpctuaiing a continuous cycle of
internal conﬂict.

In order to break this continuous
cycle of sexual assault on_Grinnell
College‘s campus, I suggest that the
college reexamine its preventative
and responsive measures to sexual
assault incidents on campus. Some
of the things that Grinnell can do, I
believe, to make this campus a much
safer place for students, are I) to ex-
pand its existing security force to
include licensed security guards or
police who are trained to deal with
crime related situations. These per-
sons would make up a part of the
college‘s permanent security force.
In no way should the college expect
facilities management and the
Grinnell Police Department to con-
stitute the primary security force for
this campus. Grinnell is one of the
few colleges and universities in this
country to not have its own trained
and licensed security force.

2)The college should also provide
better lighting throughout the came
pus to better ensure that students will
not be targeted for crime. This would
entail the installation of lights around
campus in locations where students
are known to travel into the late hours
of the night. Measures should also

be taken to endure that dorm en,
trances remain locked. not just at
times after a student has been sexu-
ally assaulted. 3) The college could
also better respond to crime by plac-
ing at least one guard or monitor in
each academic building on campus
to better ensure students' safety af»
ter hours.

These are some suggestions that I
thinks should be seriously considered
as first steps to creating a more hos-
pitable campus for men and women,
Unfortunately, none of these mea-
sures alone will guarantee that sexual
assault or incidents ofrape will never
occur again at Grinnell. but they Will
indicate to men and women on this
campus that this college is commit-
ted to doing whatever it can to make
Grinnell'a safe and hospitable envi-
ronment for all of its students.

Essentially, what I hope this inci-
dent teaches all of us the need to
work together collectively and within
our prospective groups to ensure one
another’s safety, and the need to ace
knowledge that Grinnell College is
not an island unto itself separated
from the rest of the world: that is.
the potential for violence at Grinnell
is-as great as the potential for vio
lence in the larger society, a fact that
few chose to accept.

We cannot change what has hap-
pened, but we can impact what will
happen on this campus in the near
future if students, faculty and admin-
istrators make a commitment to
working towards implementingtanr
gihle changes in the campus environ
ment. In so doing, we can we heal
the wounds, attend to the scars, and
quiet the fears that are now shared
by many in this college community.

modified their evening plans
Wednesday.

“I was planning to go to Harris to
watch Ellen,” said Kerri Barnstuble
‘97. “I still Went, but] called my boy-
friend to pick me up afterwards,"
“I live right off the porch of our
house, and my bed is right by the
window," said Shannon Guy ‘99.
"Last night I sort of barricaded it with
pillows and blankets and stuff. I
think at this point [I feel] pretty much
anger that I’m forced to deal with it,
There’s a sense of indirect violation."
Students also expressed concern
about rumors spreading on campus
regarding the incident.

“It doesn‘t matter whether it was the

serial rapist or not," Anna Tekippe .

‘99 said. "I’m really concerned that
the fact that there‘s a serial rapist in
the news will take the focus off the
fact that sexual assault is a problem
on this campus [and in general] and
needs to be dealt with."

“A lot ofpeople have been really fo-

cused on wanting to know details
about the assault, who it happened
to and things like that," said Kara
Murphy ‘97. “I don’t really think
that’s any of our business or con-
cern.”

Members of the Sexual Assault
Working Group (SAWS), comprised
of students and college staff,- met
Thursday to plan two discussion ses
sions which will take place at 4:30
p.m. today in North Lounge and at
9:30 pm. Monday in South Lounge.
The purpose of the discussion groups
will be to brainstorm ways to im-
prove safety on campus and to ad—
dress any other concerns raised by
those who attend, according to
Murphy. More sessions will be
scheduled if necessary, she said.
“It‘s reallyjustiﬁable to feel scared,“

,said SAWG member Yash Kapur ‘97.

“I come from a really big city and I
was scared to take a shower by my
self, and I‘m not undermining the
feelings of [the victim]. That’s just

how it is."

“A friend of mine received a phone
call today where the caller didn’t say
anything and hung up," Murphy said.
“This is someone who under the best
circumstances would not non-nally
be Worried about something like that,
but it scared her. It‘s like all ofa suds
den you have to second-guess all of
your traditional responses and reac-
tions to things that happen every
day."

Residence Life Coordinator Scott
Colyer spoke to a concern that many
students have expressed about how
to deal with their own feelings while
not ignoring or diminishing those of
the victim.

“I think we all can have enough com-
passion to feel scared and angry for
this woman and to feel scared and
angry for ourselves as well," Colyer
said. “Our level of safety has not
changed. Our level of awareness is
what has changed.”

uted to a “feeling ol community cin-

victims and what needs It) be done."

“We will not bow down to tile
sexual oppression that we incc," Hitllils
said.

In prior years the event has been
groupsoricnled, calling on piiilicipit-
tion from many cntnpus orgau' a
tions, This year participation oc-
curred niot'c tlil an individual basis.
The shift was intentional, Bartistuhle
said.

“Last year, I felt like I was
harrassing people to get them to par-
tic1pate,"Barnstnblc cxpltlillcd,“Rc-
cmiting paniciputlls from campus or-

ganizntions such as ASIA, CBS, SOL
and others was good ill that itensured

a sort of iokcnisill that I wanted to
gct away from."

Ill the future, Barnstuble said she
hopes that participation wtll continue

However, pm‘tictpalion for an ime
promplu sequel to this year‘s Take Back

which occurred Wednesday morning,
cun-cntly isbeingreciuiled. Inano-mail
which hascnculatod widely since Thurs-
day morning, organizers urged people to
coilveigc on the Foium Beach tomorrow

"Take Back the Night happened a
few weeks ago, and I didn’t feel very
moved by it because atthat point, the
night was ours,“ wrote Mary Johnson
‘98 in the c-lnail. “I didn’t feel like
we needed to take it back . I think
an angry, peaceful Vigil will remind
us and everyone else that we are here
and we are strong."
