The letter to Chairperson
Bulltuitinc also expressed concern
that as student opinions vary greatly,
“it is obvious that 1| move to expand
student representation to include
tiiirrotity viewpoints is imperative "

Dniani explained some ofthc cons
cerns that have lead to his tnvnlvd
merit in this issue. He believes that
minorities are not represented on the
Search Committee in museums, the
political minority or pctlplc who are
not satisfied with the representation
of the SGA. and members of racial
nilnoiitics. wire are particularly in-
fluenced by some ofthe issues that a
new president will have to face.
“Whocvcr comes into office will be
a mayor player iii the implementation
at nrarty changes." he said

“These students are dissatisfied
that they are not part oi the process,"
Dulnni continued “The inote Stu-
dents on the committee, the higher
the chalice ol’titir voice being heard."

"We want the committee to know
that we can organize and actively

that have been taken thus far. “Idc-

ally. the trustees wtll listen to us and

ice."

in a message SGA President
Clitldress Sent out [0 the studentbody
Wednesday afternoon, she acknowl-
edged student concerns about the
search process “spectlically relating
to student input and involvement in
suclt an important cvcttt in the Gritt-
iiell community."

Before Wednesday night’s mect-
itrg todiscuss dissatisfaction with the
Search process, Dr. Alceste Pappas
addressed the Joint Board ofthe Slu-
dctit Government Association, Dr,
Pappas, er Papp‘ds Consulting
Groups in Greenwich, Connecticut,
was hired by the trustees to collect
the Opinionsuof faculty, students and
staff

At Joint Board, Dr. Pnppns tried
to explain some of the issues that the
Search Committee is currently fac-
ing.

Dr. Pappas pointed out that the
existence of any Search Committee
at all is unusual. “In higher educa-
tion over the past ten to fifteen years,
it’s become almost standard opera-

tion to hire a search service, she
said, In addition the search process
at Grinnell is different because “ev-
ery other college in this country is
having to cut back." This will put
Grinnell at an advantage, as more
candidates are likely to apply for the
Job, but will also make the decision
more difficult.

Many students informed Dr.
Pappas that they were concerned

i about a lack ol'cotnirtunicatiort \vtth
Trustees. and misconceptions tltat
Trustees may have of the college,
“I'm hoping that front this point out,
the incredible lack ol‘cointnunicntion
and the mystery wtll be over,"
Childrcss said. Said another Student.
"people are concerned that the views
of the trustees ate different from
those of students."

Responding to feedback she had
gathered during her rntervrcws. Di.
Pappas pointed out that students and
faculty members seem unclear on the
role that the president of a college
plays, especially “the role of the
president as opposed to the role of
the dean "Traditionally, site said, the
