Hiroshima artwork reflects
nuclear horrors

BY RYAN OLSON
Staff Writer

1945. The world was gripped in
the throes of war. and many people
lived with a constant fear of what
horrors another day of life might
bring, August 6 and August 9: many
know these dates well, for they have
long stood as times in human history
in which mankind fully demon-
strated a power to kill and destroy
that has, since then, stood unsur-
passed.

By the end of December 1945, the
estimated number of dead stood at
210,000. Completely erased in some
instances, leaving behind them only
black marks, charred by thermal rays.
or trapped under rubble, people met
death in countless ways. The cities
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in I apan
had fallen victim to one of the worst
disasters in human history - a com-
bined total of roughly 37 kilotons of
explosive energy manifested in the
form of two atomic bombs,

Since then, over half a century has
passed, permitting citizens of not
only Japan and the United States, but
countries across the world to have ra-
tional thoughts about this disaster
and its Worldwide implications.

From November 13 to December
10, the Rosenﬁeld Program in Pub-
lic Affairs, International Relations,
and Human Rights is presenting Tar
ward a Peaceful World Free of
Nuclear Weapons, an exhibition from
the cities oinroshima and Nagasaki
chronicling the story of the survivors
and victim of the bombing, as well
as the ultim te price humankind and
our world has had to pay as a result
of using nuclear weapons,

The major theme of the exhibit is
that blame should not be placed on
the United States for the bombing,

' but that the world should ”educate
people...so we do not see such an
event in the future," as a passage con-

tained within it states, Anne Tillema‘
‘99, through her dedicated efforts,
was able to bring the exhibit here to
Grinnell.

As the story goes, Charlie Atkins,
member of the National Board ofDi-
rectors for Veterans of Peace in Co
lumbia, MO, met with Hiroshima
atomic bomb survivor Akihiro
Takahashi in 1995 at a peace confer-
ence in Japan. Invited to the United
5 t a t e s
shortly after-
w a r d s .
Takahashi
brought the
exhibit with
him. Since
then it has
been to vari-
ous locales
around the
c o u n t r y,
such as at
A m e ri c a n
University
in Washington D.C., It opened in
Paris in February of 1996.

Tlllema's home town is Columbia,
MO. She and Atkins, incidentally a
close friend ofthe family, discussed
the notion of bringing the exhibit to
campus, and the notion became a re-
ality. The exhibit left Toronto a short
time ago and is now here in Grinnell,
Funded via the Rosenﬁeld Program,
the exhibit, through its photographs,
artwork, and text, aspires to educate
people on the effects of nuclear war-
fare,

“I was surprised at how powerful
the exhibit is," mentioned Tillema,
who only recently saw it for the ﬁrst
time. Indeed, the exhibit is, at the
least, a truly powerful thing to be»
hold.

Within the photographs, artwork,
and even the lines ofa ﬂowing poem
written shortly after the bombing are
vivid images of the harsh reality of
a nuclear disaster.

“All human

ruptured as

relationships were

society was laid to
waste to its very

foundations.”
- Exhibit Passage

In the brief second of time in
which the blast occurred, ”all human
relationships were ruptured as the
entire society was laid waste to its
very foundations," reads a passage on
one ofthe panels ofthe exhibit Still
another section of the exhibit con»
tains some ofthe artwork created by
the Iiilzakitrlm, or survivors of the
bomb, in 1974—75. As a passage de-
scribing the purpose of the artwork
of the Iii'bakurhrz states, “Through
these im»
ages, the
tragedy of
that day,
etched into
the minds of
those who
were there,
can be con-
veyed to fu-
ture genera-
lions.”

The phos
t o g r a p h 5
contained
within the exhibit are quite graphic,
in many instances, and seek to show
people how terrible nuclear technol-
ogy, when used in warfare, can be.

“We would like people every
where to look unﬁinchingly at the
human consequences oftheA»bomb
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
and to realize that nuclear weapons
are incompatible with human sure
vwal,” This is the heartfelt message
which the mayors of both Hiroshima
and Nagasaki are seeking to convey
to people across the United States
and the world in a letter printed in
the exhibit r that we need to look
upon the horriﬁc results of our deci-
sions in 1945, and attempt to make
decisions in this day and age in ore
der to “create a world free of nuclear
weapons so that we can pass on a
‘beautiful and peaceful world’ to the
next generation.

This week’s movies are Fifth Ele-

Slingblade? Didn't see it. Fifth

Someone got PAID to make this
movie? If that is all you wanted to
know. you may stop reading now. If
you’re bored, please continue.

Fifth Element is the vision ofthe
future of a Frenchman named Luc
Besson, but one that is closer to
Blade Runner than Star 'It’ek. The
basic plot is a rather generic race to
save all living things from some in-
describable dark, evil being, There

is the only thing that can stop it, and

certain time. Yeah, boring, right',7
Well, it’s the visual imagery that this
movie puts its emphasis on. I would
say this is one of the more visually
stunning movies of this decade.
There is an attention to detail in the
computer animation and special ef-'
facts that I've only seen in Steven
Spielberg movies previously. This
movie had me glued to my seatjust
for the visuals,

Second to the visuals is the
soundtrack. A music major friend of
mine was absolutely entranced by the
movie’s sound track, particularly the
scene where a character is singing
and the music blends into a techno
soundtrack whileahuge ﬁghtensues.
Also, the radio DJ segments with
Ruby (Chris Tucker) were hysterical
and also very well done.

The acting in the film was rather
mediocre, but as I said, I think the
focus was on the visuals. It stars a
bunch of big name people: Bruce

Willis, Milla Jovovich (some model)
and Gary Oldman (who I don’t see
what all the fuss is about). Milla
Jovovich, is, however, very nice to
look zit, even if she talks like a dole
phin in heat.

I enjoyed this ﬁlm, and while it
doesn’t provoke me to think too
deeply about any societal problem,
it does paint a slightly more realistic
picture than Gene “Shiny Happy
People Holding Hands"
Roddenberty, It's dark, but yet the
color scheme makes me think of
Tupperware. Is it just me? I give
this movie 3 and a halfunpaid movie
reviewers with grotesque body odor
and scraggly facial hair.

I would like the take the rest of
the review to bash Strange Brew, Do
you ever get the urge to go see a ﬁlm
that is a complete and utter rape of
Hamlet? Then go see this. Other
wise. the ﬁlm is best left as a door-
siop, Maybe I am being harsh, be-
cause I hate it when movies are just
recycled versions ofsomething else.
Then again, the two stars ofthis ﬁlm
aren't exactly Academy Award win-
ners. Skunk dog made me laugh as

The Bev Corner
by Pam Vicsik and Aden Beihl

These crazy kids from “the Hills"
are much too clandestine for their
own good. They keep too many
things from each other, severing the
lines of communication, but they
think they are doing the right thing!
Secretly, however, they are doing just
the opposite, As our heroes soon ﬁnd
out, tangled webs of deception get
them nowhere fast!

In David‘s misguided attempt to
win back his misshapen cupcake (or
is that cupcakcs7), he somehow roi-
got to mention the fact that he was
indebted $15,000 to a loan shark.
This was peachy as hell, and Donna
might never have been the wiser, if
only young Silver had not hastily as
sumed that it was The Deﬂowered
One who fronted the dough to save
his ass, Unbeknownst to David, it
was actually Boat Boy and his legal-
tender harpoon who quelled ihc men-
acing collectors. Donna, always
quick about her wits, instantly put
two and two together and detemilned

that David had been harboring yet
anothersecrerregarding his ﬁnancial
troubles. Oh, David, when will you
learn? Donna cannot lovea man who
doesn’t tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

Boat Boy's hip to the scene.
Donna needs a strapping young
sailor-fellow who unbattens the
hatches ofhis inner soul for the mer-
innids in his life. What an opportur
nity for the swashbuckling Noah to
offer Donna the map to his Secret
treasure! Naturally, we‘re referring
to the buttloads ofmoney he has hide
den away in some far-offland. With
the enchanting Donna embracing
Boat Boy and all of his honesty, it is
David and Val who are left ﬁghting
their raging Conﬂagrations alone

Cooper sets students’ musical

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

On Monday, November IO, Erma
Cooper ’34 returned to her alma
mater for a three day visit, While on
campus, Ms Cooper held auditions
for the American Institute of MUSIV
cal Studies (AIMS) in Graz, Austria
and looked into forming a music
scholarship in honor
of her college room—
mate. Seven Gi-innell
students tried out for
the program which
will take place this
summer from July
61h untilAugust l4lh.

“My interest is
helping young people
decide what they
want to be and help-
ing them get there,”
said Cooper, who
serves as co-director
ofAIMS and head of
the vocal studies pro—

they’ve heard so much about.

“AIMS students travel to all over
Europe, cSpecially to Prague, Vienna
and Venice,” She said, “We are so
near to Slovenia that many students
go there for the weekend."

Many AIMS students have gone
on to enjoy very successful careers
in the performing arts. Famous

German poetry and stage artistry.
“All of the German language
teachers are American. We ’ve found
that American teachers work better
with our students, who come from
all over the world, then European
teachers." Incidentally, all of the
German teachers all happen to teach
at Ohio State University as well, “It‘s
the Ohio State Maﬁa," said Cooper

AlineAprahamian ’00 auditioned
on Wednesday after learned about the
program from Grinnell Singers choir
director John Stuhr—Rommereim.

“AIMS Seemed more focused than
[another opportunity to study music
abroad] in Vienna," said
Aparahamian. “It‘s amore intensive
six week summer program with lots
of professors and lots of instruction."

Aparahmian, who began voice
lessons in high school, has high ex-
pectatlons.

“I‘d really like the opportunity to
study music overseas. If I make it,
I’ll have a chance to meet other vo-
calists, make connections for after
graduation and see how I compare."

Jonathan Finley, ’00 decided to
audition after participating in a Mas-
ter Class critique session hosted by
Ms. Cooper on Monday.

“I heard it was a really good
school," said Finley, “and after Mon»
day, i thought I’d try auditioning.
She [Cooper] is an incredible
woman: she has a fantastic back»
ground and is Very knowledgeable,”

All AIMS auditionees are in-
formed Within two weeks of their
audition of whether or not they have
been accepted into the program. If
Finley is accepted and decides to go,
he Said he looks forward to seeing
Germany. While AIMS does not
travel as a group like many other
choir programs, Ms. Cooper con-
firmed that many AIMS students do
tzike the opportunity to see the sights

ofthernselves at the end ofthe movie.
I‘m told that to really enjoy the
movie, you must get drunk. Some-
one please test this theory for me, and
right after the movie, write me email.
Then I Will forward it to all my
friends because you were drunk and

Part seven in an on-going
series of KDIC deejay

interviews

This week, Phoebe Silag interview:
Jeremy Lundqnirt, deejay of :‘Ex-
huming Hunk." Airing at lOqui. on
Mondays, the show reveals the hid-
den inﬂuence ofHank Williams.

PS: Why is your Show called ‘Ex-
huining Hank“!

JL: The music I play is meant to raise
Hank Williams from his grave, or at
least Stop him from turning over by
seeing that there are artists interested
in real country music. If you don’t
know who I-Iank is, well,just please
don’t ever speak to me. in public at
least.

PS: Why did you choose to do a
show on country rock?

JL: The simple reason is that some
of the best music being produced cur-
rently is coun»

tryeinﬂuenced,

and a majority

of people don't

have a clue. I

don’t See why i

shouldn’t be

able to discuss

how great the

n e w

Whiskeytown

record is with at

least someone

on this campus,

I don‘t think playing this genre two
hours a week (at 10 a.m. on Mon-
days) is going to make ahuge differ-
ence. but it could turn some people
on to the music. Also, it's what I lis»
ten to the most . , I mean, who can
resist listening to Robbie Fulks sings
ing about fucking Nashville? If just
a few people more don't instantly
wince at the mention of country. ,
.well, that would be a good thing,

PS: Who else do you play?

JL: BR5749, Bottle Rockets, the
Waco Brothers, the Jayhawks,
Golden Smog, the Vidalias, the V-
Roys, Wilco, Scroat Belly, the
Volebeats. Richard Buckner, Gillian
Welch, Gram Parsons, Steve Earle,
the Old 97's, the Honeydogs, Uncle
Tupelo, the Schramms, Pinetop
Seven. Emmylou Harris, Blood Orr
anges, Tarnzition, Son Volt, Scud
Mountain Boys, Sixteen Horses

power, the Palace Brotheres, Blue
Mountain, the Starkweathers, Moone
Shine Willy, Jolene, the Backsliders,
Buick MacKane, 6 String Drag, and
others.

PS: Do you think your show has a
certain mood or feel to it?

,IL: 1 think a lot ofpeople would say
there is an overall depressive mood
going on. I can understand that since
the music I play often touches on the
subjects of lost loves and alcohol, but
I feel listening to the problems of oth»
ers makes ybur problems seem less
signiﬁcant and lets you know you
aren't alone. I do play some more
upbeat songs I really do, The
mood is most certainly centered on
the music - hell, the show is about
the music: I’m just there to push
some buttons and talk a bit,

PS: Do you play
many of your
own CD‘S?

JL: Almost ev-
ery CD or record
I’ve played has
been my own.
KDIC has a
couple ofthings:
they‘re getting
better. though.
I’ve been encour-
aging them to get
in touch with more indie labels that
put out this stuff, and they’ve been
Very receptive.

PS: Why do you think artists like
Wilco, Son Volt, and Steve Earle
have achieved some level of com-
mercial success? Which artists are
people totally missing out on?

JL: It probably comes down to ma-
jor label status. They most definitely
deserve any recognition they can get
and then even more. Jay Fanar from
Son Volt and JeffTweedy from Wilco
have done more than their share to
advance the genre through Uncle
Tupelo and their current bands. and
Steve Earle. . . where does one be-
gin7 He‘s just the king. At the top
of the list is Whiskeytown, HRS-49,
the VrRoys. Blue Mountain, and
well, my god, if you haven‘t heard
the Scud Mountain Boys, then wake
up. They leave me in complete awe.
