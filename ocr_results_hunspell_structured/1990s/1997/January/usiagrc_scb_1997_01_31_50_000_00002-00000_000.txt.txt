In their much anticipated return to
Grinnell, vibraphonist Gary Burton
and pianist Makoto Ozone will play
into the minds of inu5ic lovers on
Wednesday February 5th at 8:00‘
PM, in the Harris Concert Hall,
Bunon is one ofthe world’s bestjaz7
vibraphonists, acclaimed by both
critics and audiences alike. Mark
Dorr, a Grinnell College percussion
instructor, describes Burton’s style as
both spanning and connecting the
gap between the big band jazz era
and contemporary jazz thought,
Makoto Ozone, who makes his home
in Japan, worked with Burton'rn the
Gary Burton Quintet, Since then he
has evolved into Japan's most at:-
ciaimed jazz pianist. Now, alter
spending time in individual pursuits,
Burton and Ozone have reunited to
tour and awe audiences whcrcver

Unfortunately. it IS difﬁcult to get the
CD to run on the computeis at the colr
lege. This is because, as Leach cxe
plained, “the music industry just rcr
cently settled on a standard fomtnt,
called ‘blue book.’ for producing eit-
hanced CD3... My CD is basically
blue book compliant, but the only prob
lem now is that we have to wait tttittl
computer manufacturers catch up and
start making equipmentspecifically for
the blue book standar .”

The audio part of the CD, however, is
accessible to almost anyone and is well
wonh listerung to. Leach says his libs
eral arts education has strongly inﬂu-
enced his songs. “I do miss being in
School and being bombarded with ideas
all the time,” he said. He cries and ale
ludes to sources as varied as Joyce's
Ulysses, the myth ofIcarus, the letters
of Percy Shelley, Van Gogh, Mozart,
and Buddhism.

soon return to Japan. Burton and
Ozone began their reunion tour last

Babe

Though the phrase “fine family
fun” may ignite negative images of
recent unnecessarily sentimental
vomit such as Flipperand Free Willy
2, 1 use the heavily overused three
words to describe Babe with only the
most positive references. Essentially.
Babe is a film out of which every
one should receive somctliingﬁ
probably not your hard core coffee
house discussron topic, but more
likely a fcw credos that people ofall
ages can live by. Ifyou’vc got a bi-
zarre combination of peoplc wtth
potentially clashing interests, Babe
is a good, solid ﬁlm that everyone
should at least moderately enjoy
‘Dueto the efforts of the creators of
the film and the advantage of
animatronics, the audience becomes
engaged in slipping into the
fantastical, parable-induced world of
our hero swtne and his obstacles.
Amongst theel‘fectrve storybookrllke
atmosphere and Charlotte/‘5 Webs
esque plot, we can use the tension
and prejudice amongst the animals
to parallel disturbing similnrilies in
our own human IIlCC. There are just
enough subtleties regarding themes
such as vegetarianism to satisfy the
more discerning viewer. while the
classic “why can’t we all just get
along?" message IS presented in an
unconventional, unique manner. The
films committee has clcarly done
some master planning by bringing
this “uplifter” to Grinneli at a time
when the weather will generate some

horrible, disgruntled attitudes (Hey,
at least it's ninety minutes or free»
dom from the cold),

Can somebody tell me What kind
of world we live in where a man
dressed up as a bar gets all of my

It‘s interesting to look back to a time
when movies with big hype also

If you ’ve got a bizarre
combination of people

monumental ad campaigns Barman

grim Bat logo before it hit the screen,
Disappointingly, the two sequels that
followed it were no more than weak-
plotted, contrived slar vehicles.
However. the original continues to be
a top-level action movie classic and
a tremendous artistic achievement.

One of the little I’actoids that I
heard about Germ: llie Bitr that made
me really want to scc tlic movtc was
that the actors worked for union
wages even though many of the
people in the cast wcie big stars. Ad—
ditionally. the movie was funded by
AfricallAmerIcaii movie stars Ifclt
that that, along with the fact that I
liked many of thc actors in the cast
from previous movies and that Spike
Lee directed iii it was something I
had to sec.

Iwns not disappointed.

Thc characters are an assortment
of African American men from sev-
cral backurouttds traveling on a bits
to Washington D.C to participate iii
the Million Mnn March. Most ofthc
movie was dialogue between ilrc
characters etilter on the bus or at one
ofthe vnrious rest stops. Each ot'ihe
characters appeared, at first, to bc a
one dimensional facet of black cul-
ture; but as the movic uninvolled, the
depth of each character revealed it-
self through the way the characters
interacted, By the end ofthe movie.
each person on the bus is not simply
an adjective but a wholistic, sympa
thettc person The transition each
person in the movie undergoes
causes the int» ic to strike very close
to home,
