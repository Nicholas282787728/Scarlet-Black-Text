sweet loves down our throats this holiday season. Oh, no It seems that our
lovely SGA Films Committee wants in on [he bitterly criiel action by bring-

iiig "love" movies to our Cinemas.

Well. they‘re not the only ones who can play the pile-Ollsil‘leiOVC-lhiSs
weekend game. I introduce my love reviews of the love movies on the love
, weekend Love love love. Let the bitter parade begin.

®®

, Love Jones

J5 1 /2
Directed by Theodore Witcher,

Slari'ing Nrri Long. Lorenz Tate, and
Bill Bellamy

Love Jolie: is a quaint little movie
that traces a familiar story: boy
meets, loses. regains, loses, regains,
drives to the airport, cheats on, re-
gains, impresses with adedicalton in
a novel, and regains girl ground.
Whatthe hell did IjuSl write‘.7 I don‘t
know, Anyway, Long stars as
Nina, and Tale stars as Darius, two
young Chicagoans who end up falls
ing in love several times in [he
movie. They both try to play it cool,
and this costs them eaehother many
many times.

The story ends up being pretty
touching. The acting is nothing short
oflcrrilic, and the selllllg works with
the story terrifically. This is one or

those few love stories that actually,

makes you care about the people ills
volvcd. That’s rare, and really the key
to success in i’Ol’lIlIIHIC moVics.

Casablanca

Directed by Michael Curliz, star.
r-irr‘o Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid
Bergman

Casablanca is supposed to be
THE love story t‘or all time, Bogart
plays mister cool Rick, and runs a
club in Casablanca where bad shit
goes down on a nightly basis.
Bergman loves him back, bur is man»
nod to a Nazirrcsislance leader,
Bogart attempts to use his consider-
able suavily to get them both safely
out of the country. I’m not even go
ing to attempt to review this rnovre
out of fear and considerable inlimi-
daiion.

Concerned Black Students and the Black Cultural
Center celebrate with the entire campus

Concerned Black Sludcnts[CBS],
the Black Cultural Center, and the
Giiiniell College population as a
\\'i\(liC ‘Ulililluc the proud tradition
iil‘e cbralrng Black History Month
this February

The iiizirn goal ofthis celebration,
sliitl Sherman Willis ‘01 , treasurer of
CBS, is to achieve awarelicss of [he
neeiiiiipirsliiireiiis or Black leaders,
pnst and present, and to include other
people in the celebration or Black
heriia 'We want to show our pride
iii oili culture " sliid Willis

speaking on beliall'ot'CBs, Willis
tlnrincd that “this is a parlofAmerica
lhlil needs to he recognized and cel~
ehrnletl ..
m' tiny other national holiday," He
lurlliei stated that srtrcc Grinnell
College has "attempted" to be ethnir
Cally pluralistic and inclusionary,
CBS hopes that this celebration “will
help Giiiiricll move towards being
more realtillt'alli' culturally di-
VCRC."

Alex Adonis ‘01 said that, “Black
History Awareness Morrllt is good
because it makes us rellccl on the
\ll’ilgglcs lhtit otrr pioneers faced in
their ellort to battle the segregation
til the Black community and to com-
hnt racism,” Willis agreed that this
IS an important celebration for the
Black eomiiiunrty “to remember and
recognize the struggles our Black
inerttors encountered and to thank
them, in a sense, for struggling for

In accordance with the celebrar
[ion of Black History Month, the
Rosenfield Program in Public Af-
fairs, International Relations, and
Human Rights organized a sympo-
sium of women and development in
Southern Africa. In addition to this,
several other programs are being
sponsored by SGA, Multicultural

Harris Center is showing films
every Friday and Saturday of this
month. Among the films scheduled
are “Soul Food“ and “Glory."

Yet, location can be a problem,
Located away from either of the large
coastal population areas, Grinnell’s
isolation harms its image. Director

Kale Wallestad ‘01 sees anOther
aspect, She said, “One reason why I
chose Grinnell [was because I was]
looking for a school where people
stay on campus. Here we have to
depend on each other, At the same
time it does make it difﬁcult. . .the
lack of accessibility to things."

The study was apprehensive
about making generalizations about
students who withdrew, however,
cost was a large iaetor. or the 92%
who transfer, 69% go to a public the
stiiution, leading the consultants to
believe that cost is a major factor in
the transfer of students. In the Kane
study, cost was the third reason eited

MO ES ALENDER
The Blue Eyes of Yonta:

(Press release):

This ﬁlm lakes place in Guinea-
Bissau, a small country in West
Africa. Maysa Marla plays Yonta, a
young, beautiful woman who
represents the optimistic members of
her generation. Antonio Simao
Mendes plays Vincente, an ex-
soldier who participated in Guinea-
Bissau’s fight for independence iii
1973. The characters reflect the
changes and conflicts the country
faces in the present. The New York
Times called the film “A richly
shaded vision of a post-colonial
African society on the verge of
losing hope." Le Mortar hailed the
film as “A lucid and at the satire time
Joyous film." This 90 minute film,
directed by Flora Games in 1991, is
in color,

by students who had withdrawn.

Curriculum was also noted as a
problem? “Academic programs not
offered or comprehensive enough"
was the ﬁfth reason cited by former
students. But are students promised
a comprehensive education when
they enter Grinnell? Hansen an-
swered, “[Grinncll is] adverlised as
a liberal, highequality education
[and] people can make what they
want of it."

Although retention rates may not
be a problem among the general
population, the reports suggest that
multicultural students’ needs are not
being met, leading to their wilhe
drawal.

Both the Kane study and the
Krukowski report are available on
reserve in Hurling Library.
