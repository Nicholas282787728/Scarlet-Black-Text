The Presidential Report Card:

 

By DAVID RUDEL

Each week the general election grows closer. and as we look forward to
it, it would behoove us to look back on these past four years, How has
Clinton performed during his term at the helm? Does he deserve another
term? These are the questions I hope to lieip answer with this report card.

National Image

Grade: C +

America used to be seen as the a nation with which tio other dared to
pick an open ﬁght. When Reagan wori election, hostages that had been
held captive were released, and throughout his term we had a very no»
nonsense approach to terrorism, When America united with several other
countries in the Persian Gulf War, it was only Saddam Hussein‘s
meglomaniacal attitude that precluded a speedy end to the struggle (though
admittedly, it was this same attitude that caused it in the first place), How»
ever, when one sees the recent fiascocs in Haiti, Bosnia. Somalia, and most
recently Iraq, I wonder how much of that old respect can possibly still be
alive. When our president has to rely on Jimmy Carter, of all people, to
save his foreign policy. things can’t be too wonderful.

Economy and General Domestic Matters

Grade: C _

I feel that his is the proper grade for Bill Clinton after reading that Bush
was given a B» by an objective author, Clinton called Bush’s economy
”pathetic" and then went on to have a growth rate this past year or so of
about halfas much. I personally would have given him higher marks, but
Iﬁgure he is his own best judge. This reminds me of a campaign ideal
have for Dole: just have commercials of Clinton debating himself; he has
espoused differing beliefs on so many issues that there is no reason for
Dole to waste his energy.

In addition to this, the seeming levlty with which Clinton deals with
drug use both in his and his Cabinet's past is one reason put forth for the
renewed growth in drug use in America (which had receded slowly during
Reagan’s watch), other than the general lethargy of our troops in the war

Trust

Grade: F ( ’l" )

Let’s see, homosexuals trusted Clinton to protect their rights, welfare
mothers trusted Clinton to protect their “right” to live offthe public trough,
the middle class trusted Clinton to “feel their pain," and women trusted
Clinton to preserve their right to abortion on demand. Well, I think Jim
Steinman would agree that 1 out of four _is, bad. Hell, you can‘t even be
assured a spot in the hall of fame by batting l for 4. 1 will commend
Clinton for pretty much staying firm on his stance on abortion, but then
again it was the one Subject that it has been to his benefit politically to stay
put. Whether his partialbirth abortion (or intact dilation and extraction for
you pro-choicers) is overridden or not, he will be able to tell America how
much he tried to help them (and trust me, he will).

Other than this one issue Clinton has managed to trash most ofthe other
promises he made to the American people. Samesex marriages, etc, were
sacriﬁced to make his new and improved centrist facade, the same mask he
wore when announcing his support for a nationwide curfew. Clinton ad»
mitted (though he would rather use a different verb) to the group of stun
dents who went to the rally with Tom Harkin that his signing the recent
welfare bill was done for political reasons, and the promised tax-cut for the
middle class became the largest tax hike in our nation’s history.

Someone (I forget the name) went through the trouble of counting all
the promised Clinton made during his campaign. He ended up with about
170, of which Clinton kept about 1713. Isupposc that would be a Din most
classes. but his same-sex marriage/ welfare bill sins brought him further
below Crievci.

Integrity
Grade:

This is where Clinton really lost it. Now, I admit that some of this
grade was spillsover from the trust category, burl posit that this has
more to do with the root causes of his lying rather than his lying
itself. Along with his predilection toward turning the White House in
to the Wafﬂe House', he has managed many other amazing feats:

Paula Jones

Jennifer Flowers

Travel Office Firings

Unnamed Mistress in _Unlimited Access,

Whitewater, and all the subsidiaries (Vince Foster, shredding
session after Ron Brown dictl)

This is quite a list. Most presidentsjust get one minor one: Nixon
had Watergate, Ford sacrificed his second tcmi to pardon Nixon, Carter
had those pesky hostngcs, Reagan had Iran Coniiu, and Bush had
“read my lips" along with a laughable rumor about infidelity. Clinton
may have finally eclipsed Ulysses S, Grant. but Grunt at least had
dipsomania as an excuse. Add to all this the blatant continued lying
to the American people about how the Republicans cut Medicare,

and this grade was easy.
Average: D

Let's see C+,Cs, F, E GPA: 1.0

Hmm, well. I guess it makes sense for Clinton to be a nlembcr of the
party in the pocket book of the national teacltcrs‘ union. a group which
would like to see grades based on pretty much anything other than ability.

 

 

 

By BEN PATRICK

Well, it‘s election time again. A time when politicians and their han-
dlers get together to tell us how bad ajob their opponent has been doing.
As you might expect, we've been hearing a lot from Bob Dole and his
minions about what a badjob President Clinton has been doing. At least,
that's the meaning of the message. But, as anyone can tell you, truth and
campaigns rarely mix. So let’s take a meaningful look at Clinton's last 3-
aitdsashalfyears, andsec what‘s true, and what's not

The Economy

Grade: A+

It’s the economy, stupid. Bill Clinton’s #1 focus in ‘92 was the
economy, and how to improve it. You won'thear it from Rush Limbaugh's
mouth, but the fact is, the economy has been improving at a faster rate
than anyone expected, The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that job
growth for the last three years has averaged 2.4%, Doesn‘t sound like
much, does it? But, ifyou compare that to Reagan’s average job growth
(2.1%), or to George Bush's anemic 0.6% growth rate, you get some Idea
how much better things have gotten. In the past three years, we've qua»
druplcd our yob growth rate. And Clinton is doing way betterthan Reagan
did. In fact, since World War Two, only two presidents have had better
JOI) growth numbers: Johnson and Carter. But, the conservatives might
argue thatjob growth ISJUSt one category. So, consider that private in-
vestmcnthas gone up 18%, Personal savings have also gone up 18%. 1.2
million new businesses have been started. 6 million ncwjobs have been
created. And Treasury revenues have gone up 13%,

Domestic Programs

Grade: A ,

Government at work. In addition to wonderful economic growth.
the Clinton Presidency has seen the creation of some of the best govern
ment programs since the New Deal. Al Gore’s National Performance
Review, which is aimed at streamlining government, has already saved
taxpayers $58 billion, and has compiled a list of 180 speciﬁc reforms that
will save us $70 billion, It’s out the size of an application for a loan from
the Small Business Administration from a 2»ineh thick pile of documents
down to 2 pages. And then there’s AmeriCorps, Clinton‘s college»stur
dent volunteer program. IBM conducted an independent analysis of the
impacts ofthe program. The result? For every dollar taxpayers invested
in AmeriCorps they got from 31,6010 $2.60 back. Also, we‘ve gotten the
Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows working parents to get up
to 12 weeks off from theirjobs to give birth, or to tend to their kids.

Integrity

Grade: B +

Clinton‘s morals. Okay, so we really had to get to this at some point.
Put yourself in the Republicans' shoes: it’s obvious you can't say any-
thing bad about the economy under Clinton. And you can't even say
anything bad about his vice»prcsident. So, what are you going to do?
You have to dredge up everything you possibly can that Bill Clinton, his
friends, friends of his friends, or people he met once at a big party in 1952
have ever done that might, possibly, maybe be unethical And that’s just
what the Republicans have done. And what's the result been? Zero, The
fact is, from Vince Foster’s tragic suicide to “FileGate” to “TravelGate”
to “CastleGate” or whatever pseudo-scandal the Republicans are harping
on today, Bill Clinton has never even been named a defendant. Do you
know what charge lies at the center of “Whitewater"? The question is:
Did Bill Clinton use his inﬂuence as governor ofArkansas to obtain loans
that he wouldn’t otherwise have been able to maintain. Funny, isn’t it'.7
But the Republicans depend on (and have thus far been served well by)
vague accusations, sensationalisticJournalism, and misinformation.

Foreign Policy

Grade: A

Foreign policy We've been hearing Republicans harp on Bill Clinton's
poor foreign policy since the day after he took office. So, let’s look at
what he's done. He achieved the goals Bush set, but could never meet, in
Somalia. He sent U.S. troops to the former Yugoslavia, which brought a
temporary end to over a year ofbruial civil war and ethnic cleansing. He
oversaw the peace treaty between the PLO and Israel, a treaty that, in
1990. Yassir Arafat said would “never happen." And now, he’s making
sure the Iraqis abide by the UN-designated “no-fly" zones, in order to
keep Saddam Hussein from continuing his war against the Kurds. Seems

to me like he's doing a pretty good job.

The ﬁnal Word. So, let's summarize, Bill Clinton has brought us an
era of economic growth virtually unsurpassed in modern time He's
introduced government programs that are streamlining government, help-
ing citizens, and more than paying for themselves. And he's done all of
this while moving towards a balanced budget and overseeing some cfihe
most dramatic changes in global politics we've seen since the fall of the
Iron Curtain, Forget what Republicans say: focus on the truth. We haven't
ltad leadership like this in the White House since JFK drove into down
town Dallas.

As a final. unrelated note, David Rudel and I are happy to announce
the S & B’s creation of a new Opinions section. We hope that the addi-
tional space we (eventually) get. which should be an entire page, will
give us the opportunity to write more in»depth articles, like this one, and
to have guest WriierSJOin us every week, We’d also like to hear from you.
Every week, you can write in and give us your opinions on the topic we
announce for next week, and we'll publish them right alongside our ar-
ticles. So, if you have something to say, or if you want to be a guest
columnist, email us at [Rudel] or [Patrick] or write the S & B at [sandb].
lfyou're really into that VAX thing, you CanJUin David and I, along with
many others. on the Notesboltrd "In_Contempt " Ifyou don't know about
it, ask any UC. Next week’s topic “Does Flat Tax Equal Flat Head?"

The First Run

 

 

KURT ORZECK

The other day, I made up my
mind. Iwalked into my closet, spots
ted two sneakers, and dropped them
onto the floor. Looking at the wom-
down pair, 1 was decided. Today I
would run.

Not since early June had I laced
up and gone running, Four years
of crossscountry drillcd a constant
urge to run in me, but a constrain»
ing summerjob held me back from
doing so. Now it was time to re
kindle the flame.

Idresscd into my running clothes
and crammed my feet into the un-
derstzed shoes. When I stood up. I
immediately felt awkward. Some-
thing was terribly wrong. Ipeered
down at my feet Not only were the
shoes much too small, I was wears
ing two left ones. Lesson to be
learned: never buy two pairs of the
same shoe.

Anyway, after a package of my
other running shoes arrived. I was
more than ready to run. Luckily, a
fellow hallmate shared my sentis
ment. We planned aday to run, and
sure enough, we did,

Every now and then, Grinnell
bafﬂes me. Here we are, in the
middle of Iowa. planted amidst
thousands ofacrcs ofcorn, and what
do we see around ourselves? Trees.
Part of the reason I ventured out
here was to bear Witness to a pan of
the Country I had never seen before.
Instead, I feel like I never left home.
The similarity the college shares
with a New England campus is un»
canny. Thus, I had all the more rea~
son to run. Not only to perform the
ultimate form of exercise. but also
to get a close»up View of this
region’s true surroundings.

As my friend and lyogged away
from the school, we found ourselves

simultaneously entering the world
of corn. We took a turn, and, saw
before ourselves a sea of browns
and yellows, basking in the after
noon sun, ‘

After living my life in a constantly
cluttered New England setting, I
found such beauty in the simplicity
of what lay around us. Miles of
grain, protecting the ground from
the sun like a Guide form of suntan
lotion.

With each running step I took, I
saw more and more magniﬁcence
in the fields. When the wind blew,
the stalks swayed in unison. Like a
wave, a whitewash swept over
them. In the middle ofthe ocean of
cornstalks, I noticed an island of
trees, Lurking Within lay a
barnhouse, the heart of the sur-
rounding fields.

While we ran by the fields, I ob
served the perfection of each row.
I find it amazing that within the tril-
lions of cornstalks crammed into
each acre of land, there lies a pro»
found organization. Upon passing.
Isziw a sliver ofa row between the V
stalks,

I turned ahead to the open road.
Within the half-hour or so we ran,
about ﬁve cars passed by. I revered
the great solemnity engulﬁng us.
How underrated peace is, I thought.
To be relieved from barking dogs,
whiny, matenal»possessed children,
and the rest of the horrors of Ameri-
can suburbia. To be in a place where
you can hear yourself think. Now
that is my definition of heaven.

Eventually, we headed back to the
college. I returned, showered, pre-
pared myself for a last-minute rush
to the dining hall. I retired my run»
ning sneakers to my closet. Taking
a deep breath, I promised myself
that the run I took would be the ﬁrst
of many to come.
