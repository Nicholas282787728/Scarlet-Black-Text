Football Concludes
Disappointing
Season With Loss

By Erica Tarpcy

Grinnell's 30710 loss to Illinois
College on Saturday ended a dis-
appointing season for the Pioneers.
IllinoisCollegejumped outin front
early to a 20-0 lead and surprised
Grinnell by utilizing their passing
game. In the second quarter, the
Pioneers got a turnover near mid-
ﬁeld and ended the possession with
aone-yard touchdown run by quar-
terbaCkTim Hyde. Before halftime.
Grinnell moved the ball 58 yards
from its own 30 to enable Jay
Ludlam to score a field goal. Grin-
nell ended the halfdown 30710 but
with good momentum that it hoped
to continue after halftime.

Grinnell's momentum did not
hold however, and Illinois College
scored a quick field goal and
touchdown. The shoulder injuries
ofTedSIanley andJeffShook were
also detremenlal to the Pioneers,
Grinnell held Illinois College
scoreless for the rest of the game,
leaving the final score Illinois
College 30. Gnnnell 10.

Overall. Coach Wallace saw it
as the conclusion of a disappoint-
ing season. By the second week,

seven players were outwith inj dries,
and several more get hurt during
the restof the season. The Pioneers
had a very tough schedule this year
playing primarily teams with win-
ning records.

Wallace commended the four
seniors for their outstanding con-
uibutions to the team. Captain
linebacker Scott Trucsdell had his
”best year of football here at Gl’lflr
nell.” Mike Galaty was a strong
contribution to the defensive line
even when facing opponents 100
pounds heavier than himself, Ara
Bulbulian was “the best pass rusher
Grinnell has seen in about ten
years,” and quarterback Tim Hyde
had “a lot of burden and responsi—
bility to lake on,” but pleased the
coaching staff with his accomr
plishments. The seniors wercaidcd
by strong freshman contributions.

In looking toward next season,
Wallace stressed the importance of
theoff season to enable tthioneers
to be physically stronger in the
conference next year. He also sees
great leadership coming from the
15 juniors to lead the Pioneers to
accomplish their goals next year.
