CIA agent, Verne Lyon, to answer
this question. Lyon will come to
Grinnell Friday, May 3rd, toexplain
the role of the CIA today and the
role he believes it should have in the

“They have to come up with
more reasons for existence, now in»
stead of one dragon [the soviet
Union] there are several. They keep
coming up with more reasons for
covert actions," Lyon said. He be—

tain the information wing of the
CIA because he believes govern.
ments need to know what is going
on, but covert operations must be
eliminated. “The problem with co—
vert operations is that [they are]

counter to the U S. constitution and
international law.” Lyon stated.

a third grader at Davis elementary
school, was abducted from her home

and killed, Parents were dismayed by
the lack otprogmms at the elementa
