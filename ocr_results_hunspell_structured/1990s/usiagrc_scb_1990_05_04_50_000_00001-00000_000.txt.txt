The Exxon Education
Foundation‘s Mathematics Educa-
tton Program has awarded Grinnell
a three-year grantof$18,315 for a
projecttoimprove statisticseduca-
tion at undergraduate liberal-arts

support three annual workshops of
statisticians from eleven selective

confronting statistics education at
liberal-arts colleges.

shop (SLAW) will meet during
the summers of 1990-1992 to ﬁnd
solutions to problems such as the
limited number of PhD. statisd-
cians on liberal~arls college facul—
ties and the lack of practical appli-
cations to accompany the statistin
cal theory taught in classes.

The SLAW series was organ-
ized three years ago by Thomas
Moore. associate professor of
mathematics at Grinnell College,
who will administer the grant. and
Rosemary A Roberts of Bowdoin
College. The next meeting will be
hosted by Bowdoin College from

July 740.

yoke,0bcrlin,Pomona, St. Law-

rencc, Smith, and Swartlllnorc
Colleges have participalcti in an-
nual meetings to address issues
from the perspective of the small

By Diane Brumley

De La Soul, the “ﬁrst rap act
ever to come to Grinnell,..[or] to
venture into Iowa," also left Iowa
earlier than expected.

The group stayed at the Best
Western Motel Grinnell, and ac-
cording to owncheggie Campbell,
had “been verydisruptive and loud,"
from the dme they checked in Fri-

them along, completely unex-
pected." said Concerts Committee
ChairSam Perlman. "We expected

received many complaints from
other guests," said Campbell. “

The Grinnell police were notia

checked out.

negatively inﬂuence out relation-

especially the Best Western and
Motel 8, because we've been able
rework very successfully with them
in the past," said Perlman.

nal fee with DeLa Soul," he added
