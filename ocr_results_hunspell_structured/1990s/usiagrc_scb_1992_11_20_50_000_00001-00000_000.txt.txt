KDIC to shutdown

by M hael —Kavanagh

Yesterday KDIC Station Man
ager Adam Kashuba decided to shut
down the radio station, effective fol-
lowing Thanksgiving break. In a let-
ter submitted to theScnrlei antiBlack
(it was received too late to be repro
duced in its entirety in this issue).
Kashuba explained his reasons, the
main one being KDICs failure to
meet several FCC regulations.

Student Affairs recently hired a
newcnginecrforthestation.andupon
inspection, the engineer discovered
numerous violations, including DJs'
operating licenses not posted on the
site, failure to operate theEmergeney
Broadcast System and a "missing"
operating license for the station's 100
watt transmitter.

Kashuba found a note in the stu—
dio earlier last week which asked
"several pointed questions about[his]
leadership capabilities asstationman-
ager." In order to announce the newly

discovered FCC code violations and
to discuss the questions thathadariscn
about his leadership, Kashuba called
a meeting for all DJs last night. Few
DJs actually attended the mandatory
meeting.

In his letter, Kashuba expressed
frustration that so few Dls actually
attended such an impormnt meeting.
It is, however, a larger issue: He con-
tended that "DJs showing little re-
spect for KDIC has been occurring
for a long time." Having been on the
staff last year, Kashuba explained
how the staff planned to make KDIC
a "more serious radio station" this
year. Citing DJ apathy and lack of
respectformestation,Kashubaclaims
the changes he intended to make had
little or no effect.

Kashuba and the rest of the staff
intend to "work diligently" while the
station is down to write a staff hand»
book and to make KDIC legal again.
He apologizes to those DJs who did
act responsibly.

Wenre ”livingi'rl neryt'nterestingtimes, ” said Shchnrnnsky
tohisnuiliencein SouthLounge.

the statement, “Everyone wnats to be
somebody,andtobcnobody,without
identity. is a very bad thing," In addir
tion, the ”moral depression" that has
overtaken the former Soviet Union
has leftthe people “needing an explae
nationineedin g a scapegoat," a role
fulfilled by the Jews. He related this
to why there is now a “thoroughly
unique exodus" to Israel having num—
bers of 1 200 000 people in 1988 and
1989, The Jewish humanist then
praised Israel forits beauty and safety
“where people smllcand they agree,"
as Shcharansky put it. but admitted
that the “honeymoon has passed."
Because the ”most educated popula
tion of people ever are in Israel, with
61% having a higher education,"
Slieharansky stressed the need for
cheap labor, the lessening of govern~

merit control and economic reform.
He finished his speech stating that
because of the million more Jews in
Russia, Israel needs to “become a
new type of society thatcreates many
jobs of the type that these people are
interested in."

After this speech, he answered
questions on the role ofthe church in
the present Commonwealth. the co-
existence of Russia and Jews, the
attitudesofmixedJew/nonchwIami»
lies emigrating to Israel and the des»
tiny of the former Soviet Union and
resentment among native Israelis to
the Russian immigrants. To the last
question, Shcharansky answered,“ln
the next two or three years, there will
be a lot of frictions. but in ten years. it
will look like a rotnantic history of
the past."
