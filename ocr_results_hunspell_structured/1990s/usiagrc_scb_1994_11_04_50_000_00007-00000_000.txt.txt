trictrace is thatthe winnerwillbe
determinedbyas few as SOVotes.
Terpstra. an attorney at tho Bricrly
Law Office in Newton, Sully and
Grinnell,knowsGririnellCollege
can sway the vote. “I want
[people] to know that I want to
represent citizens of this district,
and that includes the college stu-
dents."

In a phone interview con4
ducted Thursday, Terpstm out-
lined his goals for change in the
House of Representatives.

ON November 8, we will
again be going to the polls to
select our state’s leaders.
There are again a number of
highly quaiiiicd candidates
seeking public office. One of
those superb candidates is
Anne Pedersen, who is run-
ning for Secretary of State.
Anne understands both
the possibilities and limita»
tions of this administrative
office. She has proposed a
number of innovative ideas
for better administering both
electionsandthebusinessser-
vicesdivision, However, Ms.
Pedersen does realize that she

One of his main concerns is
the criminal justice system. As
an attorney. Terpstra has spent
time working with people on the
inside of the criminal justice
system, “soliciting suggestions
fromot’ficials ofwhatwecando.
The problem is that people who
commit crimes are not sewing
Ute time they shoud because of
prison overcrowding."

ToTerpsua,uteissucofpris-
ons extends beyond overcrowd»
ing to Iowa citiwens‘ home lives.
“It‘s of concern to everyone to
feel saferathome, and thatmeans
doing whatever wecnn to makea
safer environment."

A 1981 graduate of Iowa
State University, a major con-

is not running for a legisla-
tive office, and is therefore
not proposing legislation
dealing with issues over
which she will have no con-
trol, such as crime.

As Secretary of State,
Anne Pcdersen would work
hard to increase voter turnout
through making the ballot box
more accessible toalllowans,
As our schedules become
more and more hectic, it is
more important than ever that
voting be made as easy as
possible.

Pedersen is also highly
qualified for the office. She
has served for 12 years as
Lee County Auditor, where
she has implemented new

Terpstla sha‘es goals in interview

cem of Terpslm‘s is education.
Tcrpstra has been endorsed by
The Iowa Education Association,
“I’ll do what I can to maintain
fundingforgmntprogramstohelp
studentspay forhighereducation.“

Terpstra has long held his
stance on abortion. He stated,
“I‘ve always believed that abor—
tion is wrong, but there’s a prob-
lemwiththestatetellingawoman
that she can't have an abortion:
with that woman not being given
a choice."

When asked about his stance
on the subject of gay rights,
Tcrpslra said. “I believe whole
heartedly that people should not
be discriminated against for any
reason."

Student endorses Pedersen

ideas which have served as
models for statewide pro-
grams. Because county audir
tors and the secretary of state
deal with similar issues,
Pedersen’s experience will be
highly valuable to her.

As a county auditor. Anne
Podersen has also learned the
value of local delivery ofser-
vices. As secretary of state.
Anne would work with county
officers to deliver services as
efficiently as possible, and rcr
turn more power to a local
level.

We have a great opportu-
nity on November 8 to elect a
great slate of officials, I en-
courage you to vote for Anne
Pedersen for secretary ofstate.
