LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

£Washburn chose wrong analogy

’To the editor,
, I am writing in response to Mike
ywashbum‘s column last week en-
titled“LeflistKrirtallnachl.”Iapprer
« ciate that everyone has the right to
, call on historical events in order to
explain the present. However, I feel
' that Washbum did not choose an ap-
,propriate analogy when drawing a
parallel between Knitullriacht and
‘ multi culturalism/political correct-
‘ ness. Kristallrmchl can be seen as a
, blatant example of Violent oppres-
sion and racism. If now the event is
* cited too frequently and incorrectly it
kcould lose its historical relevance.
Kristallnachtis minimized when it is
7 part of a constant argument that does

not really concern that particular
event. However, if people claim that
groups are being oppressed it is prob»
ably a good idea to hear their come
plaints out. Consequently,although I
think Washburn does not use
Krirrallnacht correctly, he deserves
to be heard as much as anyone. One
other opinion is that Kristallnacht
could be used appropriately to shed
light on some of the issues in
Washbui‘n's column. In times ofeco—
nomic hardshipitbccomes popularto
blame minorities and immigrants for
a country's failures. This is exactly
what happened to the Jews of Ger-
many and other minorities.
Krinallmzchl teaches us that such a

solution is wrong both morally and
practically.Atthesametimetheevcnt
demonstrates that it is never too early
to look out for oppression and mis-
guided hate.

Sarcasm

To the editor,

The column on Judge Gage was sup
posed to be sarcastic. Of course I
wouldn’t suggest another woman on
the Supreme Court. (Chill out Grin-
nell; that's a joke too). Sincerely,

Ann Treistrnan '92

A resolution supporting Mike
:Washburn's Feb. 14 column

To the editor,

Whereas we, like Mike Washbum,
are abunchofseared whiteboys, erat
least some of our best friends are
scared white boys; and

‘ Whereas we. too, worry about the
possibility that someday there may be
enough Mexicans (MexicanrAmcrir

:cans7) in the Southwest to vote {or

,secession and “[provoke] another
Civil War”; and

Whereas we sure don’t want to

) have to learn any language which

rolls its r s; and

Whereas recognizing everyone's
legitimate voice in society justmakes
for too many views to neatly dichoto-
mize; and

Whereas there are simply not
enough white people to go around
anymore; and

Whereas we are not so muchhomy
as xenophobic:

We hereby declare our solemn in-
tention to fuck like bunnies until the
hegemony of scared while boys can

be once again established beyond a
doubt

ESCRATCHINGS or A MAD MAN
Elections evoke verbal diarrhea

I do not intend to deliver an en-
dorsementofany pariicularSGAcan-
didale in this column, even though it
isacampus-orientedcolumn thatwill
notmn again before the election. But
this election is already sewing as a
timely reminder of a terrible vacuity
and hypocrisy in Grinnell politics that
first hit me in all its ugliness during
the campaign of three years ago.

A very pleasant, unassuming man
by the name of Simon Levin was
doing something slightly outofchar»
acter - he was running (against the
career teehnocrat Rob Killion and the
scream in gly funny andextrovert Paul
“Sloalie” Froese) for President of
SGA. And he was proposing a genur
inely new, radical and highly sensible
scheme - having a doctor resident in
the Health Center.

One might expect the stereotypi-
cal Grinncll student, committed to
peace, liberty and socialjustice, to be
all in favor of this scheme. Instead,
Levin was mercilessly cut down in
the public arena of the final pre-elec»
lion Open Forum by a Who’s Who of
the very politically correct types who
claim to - and arguably do - hold
Grinnell‘sconscience. These people,

' who never tire of telling people how
r liberal and fair-minded theyare, were

Daniel Bliss

railing on Levin for advocating the
expenditure of a modest amount of
revenue from the health center fee for
a scheme which ﬁts the deﬁnition of
liberal and fairrminded very well.
From the lips of these people came

a stream of verbal diarrhw about the
need for freedom of choice and the
infringement of personal liberties,
values which, as even the right wing
Heritage Foundation points out, have
led to hundreds of billions of dollars
a year in excess health care spending
in this country . and $23 a time for a

Reproductive rights

not sacred

On Monday, an Irish High Court
judge in Dublin issued a permanent
injunction banning a fourteen year
old girl from leavmg hercountry. Did
the girl commit a crime? Was she
running away from home? No. The
girl was raped and became pregnant
in Ireland, a country which strictly
forbids abortion. The girl wanted to
travel to England, where abortion is
legal.

The case became an issue for the
courts when the girl’s parents wor»
ried that an abortion might interfere
with therapeproceedingthcenainly
would. In fact, Ireland‘s Minister of
Health feels that “the baby should be
born and adopted.” He fails to show
any understanding about the nine
monthperiod during which this young

in America

girl would have to carry the fetus of
her attacker.

The Irish government is notknown
for its sensitivity, Because of its
unyielding laws concerning abonion
(not to mention the fact that birth
control is illegal), over 4,000 Irish
women go abroad each year to obtain

abortions. In these cases, the women
have the ﬁnancial means to control
their reproductive rights. With the
ease of the fourteen year old girl, even
this bias of privilege could be erased

A NEW PERSPECTIVE
Not the answer

If you open the Spectator, you see
some articles which are well written,
and bring out some important and
poignant arguments about our carn-
pus life; arguments which too many
people brush off as merely reaction-
ary in this bastion of and political
correctness. Likewise, some of the
most important points in the S and B
are waved off as only this weeks fad
among the politicallycorrect No one
is convincing anyone else of any-
thing: no one is examining an entire
picture: no one is willing to be
changed; no one is getting off their
soapboxlongenoughtolisten;noone
is thinking.

This is said. In a place where the
brightest young minds in America are
supposed to come to be nourished
and expanded, we ﬁnd nothing but a
waffle iron, pressing them into the
same shape. 1 am not talking about
theprofessorsnorevenournewprmi-

 

 

dent, Mrs. Ferguson. I am talking

about the students who come here
with all the answers. The students
who jump right into college telling
everyone who will listen that they
know the secrets of the universe are

the problem. They come here with
