To the Editor,

As last scmcslcr’s editor of
The Gum, l was greatly disturbed
by Eric Olsen’s review of my
former employer. The current
Gum staff is ouiragad. First off,
Mr. Olsen dclibcralcly reinforced
the fallacy that “Gum“ is rln zlcro-
nym, “Gum” does not stand for
anything, much less “Grinnell
Underground Magazine." We
have always received our fi-
nances from SPARC. and we hzlvc
never been, therefore, “under-
ground.“ Although we operate
as a front for the Slmbianese Lib»
oration Army in their attempt to
found a new homeland in tthtate
of Iowa, we are not a revolution»
ary organization. If, however, our
persecution continues, we will be
forced underground.

Statements such as "The
GUM [sic] will accept and print
just about anything” are wrong,
helix in fact and in spirit. We
never would have printed Eric
Olsen‘s article. Such statemenls
are symptomatic of the problem
we face on this campus. We have
been marginalized. We have been

derided and denigrated. Well.
brothers and sisters, it is time for
us to fightback!

Shiton your taboos! Shit on
your values! And shit on you!
Now, my friends, we issue a call
to arms! The USDA has allowed
Bob’s and Quad to operate with
impunity, but has denied The Gum
funding and, on multiple occa—
sions, has allcmplcd to infiltrate
our staff. Let us gather in Wash-
ington! We will meet the Dav
partment of Agriculture face-lo;
face! The SEC has not investi-
gated ourchargcs ofinsidcrrtradr
ing practices relating to the col-
lege endowment. Those Grmcn
will pay tool

We will use our knowledge
and the tools of science to con—
struct an atomic bomb, and
threaten lhc town ofGrinncll with
nuclear annihilation if the mayor
does not concede to our ycl-un-
formulated dcmands. We know
the forces of the AFL-CIO and
the MulliAElhnic Coalition are ar-
rayed against us. Onward, {517
low zealots, to our destruction!
At least we will die with dignity,
not as cxplorlcd tools ofthe capi-
talists, but as proud workers!

Eric Krauss, '94

Dear Editor,

This lcller has been wrillcn to
perform a valuable service for any
one who is, or will ever in the future
be, living in adonn with a lounge. if
you value Ihc building you livz in at
all, do nol lcl lhc swim team hzvc
their and of season party in it.

Last weekend the residents of
Main lcarncd LhC hard way why no
donn on north campus would letthcir
lounge be used for the swim leam
party. Gardner has hosted louder,
bigger panics bciore, but Lhc swim
learn party was probably the most
blaIanlJy obnoxious. A window be-
ing broken in Gardner is, all the least,
excusable but riding the elevator up
to the fourth floor and stalling ceil-
ing tiles? How about dropping the
cannon on third ﬂoor intosomeone’s
door and having lhc cans spill every
where? Trashing the second floor
bathrooms? And laundry roomi7 Not
to mention stopping the elevator for
15 minutes With the alarm going off,
orrunning through hallways yelling?
The highlight probably was various
swim team members urinatingon top
of the elevator.

They didn’lgctthchintwhcnlhc
elevator was propped open on other
ﬂoors so Lhat they wouldn’tgcl init.
Or the sign Staling “SWIM TEAM
GO Hohﬂi!” They were given the
privilege of usmg Gardner but still
roamed the halls on every floor.
frankly, being stupid

Notallswim team members were
responsible for the mess, bull! is difﬁr
cult to tell those individuals from the
more obnoxious ones, Their oppo—
ncnls mayrcspccllhcm in lhcpoo1,bul
very few residcnls of Main have any
respect left for them at all. One oflhc
most concise reactions to the whole
ordeal was scrawled in the clcvatorlhc
next day, “SWIMMJSRS SUCK."

Sincerely,

Several Residents of Main Hall
