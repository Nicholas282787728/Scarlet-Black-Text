Grinnell grads participate
in Out on the Job program

By India Weston

In the cozy confines of Main
Lounge, four Grinnell graduates,
ranging from the class of ‘65 to ‘90,
shared their individual experiences
of being “out“ on the job. Perspec-
tives and attitudes varied with each
person, but each lent a myriad of
questions and possibilities to the
discusstion.

The evening began with Jean
Rowe, ‘88.describing her present job
and thetmnsition from Grinnell to the
real world while being a lesbian. She
iscurrendy employed with a day pro
gram for mentally retarded adults in
Minneapolis, ajob which she enjoys.

For Rowe, coming out is an “on-
going process,” and she is currently
not completely “out." In obtaining
her presentjob, Rowe made ita point
to look into the non-discrimination
policy of the establishment, a point
made again by some of the other
speakers. She also stated that at her
interview, she felt one of the two
interviewers was a lesbian as well,
which helped put her at ease.

Mall/ally?

OutofaZS-member stufﬁaceordr
ing to Rowe, there are three lesbians
and one gay male. The three lesbians,
however, are not “out,” which both—
ers Rowe. “There should be more
support"l'orpeople who wanttocome
out,shesiated.Aldiough she has”eon-
nected" with these individuals, none
of her othercorworkers asks herabout
being a lesbian. She wants to be able
to talk about her “personal life" just
like anyone else, but she feels that in
ignoring that aspect of her life, in
some way rejects her life.

A very lively Scott England, ‘90,
gave his perspective on what it's like
to be in nursing school as a gay man,
especially since he has “been very
open." England stated that he has had
encounters with people who send
“very loud messages" against homer
sexuality, yet he also tied the over
whelmingly female field of nursing
with more understanding. Women,

be “ideal” if he could find a hospital
Wllh sexual orientation in its policy,
but “there aren't that many hospitals
that tire that progressive.”

Mary Cannon, ‘80, told a different
story. She did not have to worry about
coming out at work because people
know before she arrived. She did not
“comeout”unijlal'tcrgraduating from
Grinnell, and she compared what it
was like being a lesbian in Iowa City,
where she initially “came out," to the
different atmosphere of Cedar Rap-
ids, a place which was a lot less ac—
cepLing.

Rick Hahn, ‘65, is presently em-
ployed at the Department of Human
Services in Cedar Rapids. It did not
occur to Hahn that he was gay while
a student at Grinnell. but he has been
in a long-term relationship for over
12 years. Hahn stressed being “out”
simply because it’s “simpler,” alr
though he added, "being ‘out' on the

for him, have been more accepting of job is something you can do after you

his sexuality.

Again, the issue of nonrdiserimi-
nation on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion surfaced. England felt it would

Two Nice Girls

Funky rock—

'n‘-roll band

Two Nice Girls promises
enjoyment for everyone

By Alanna Walen

Two Nice Girls is just a cute
name, compared to the power of
this band. I hope the picture helps
you geta better impression of what
this band is all about. What they
should really call themselves is
“four hot dykes who play damn
goodrock androll."Butthey might
not get into as many music stores'
inventories that way.

I first heard ofTwo Nice Girls a
few years ago,when someone made
me listen to “the birth control and
beersong."ItmayhavebeenShelly
and Louie, for all I know. The" I
saw them play at the National
Women'sMusie Festival in Mayof
1990.

Alllcouldsaywas"wow.”They
were talented, energetic, women-
ccntercd rock~antlrrol|in' women
who excelled at everything from

mushyballads(aboutotherwomen,
of course) to a surprisingly fresh
cover of “Purple Haze.” I wentright
out and bought one of their tapes.
Later that summer, I found their
other tape in a boppy, neon music
store in a Wisconsin mall and I
knew that they must have some
widespread appeal.

Please believe me. You will an,
joy this band, If you relate to the
gay community at all, you will love
the lyrics. it you can't quite cope
with loudgaypeopleand whatthey
have to say,just listen to the music.
If you think George Bush is cool
and undeserving of
criticism...okay, maybe notevcry-
body will enjoy this band. But, re-
ally, almost everybody will. They
will be playing in the Harris Center
at 10 pm. tonight, And watch out
forthedroolinglesbiansin the front
row.
