Grinnell professor presents plaque
to pope in ceremony at Vatican

HaroldKasimow, George Drake pro—
fessor of religious studies at Grinnell
College, recently presented a plaque to
pope John Paul II at the Vatican.

The plaque commemorated
Kasimow’s new book, “John Paul ll
and Intcrreligious Dialogue.”

“The experience was especially
moving for me; because I, like the
pope, was born in a small town in
Poland," Kasimow said. “During
World War [1, as Nazi forces were
entering my village, my parents and
sisters and I were saved by a Catholic
priest We are the only Jewish family
from that village whose members all

survived the Holocaust Being in the
presence ofthe pope this summer was
a truly powerful experience for me, my
two daughters and my wife, LolyaLlp-
chitz, who works with the Iowa Peace
Institute in Grinnell."

Includes essays

The book, co-edited with Rabbi
Byron l_. Sherwin, includes essays by
some of the leading Buddhist, Jewish
and Muslim voices ortoday, including
the Dalai Lama, Roshi Robert Aitkcn
and Mahmoud Ayoub. It also includes
a selection ofwn'tings and speeches by
the pope on Judaism, Islam and Bud-

An enthusiastic group of young
people from Grinnell High School got
a jump start on homecoming Saturday,
prepaing for the game with Winterset
by painting the windows in the former
Ben anklin Store on Main Street in
downtown cinnnell in gorgeous bright
colors of red, blue and yellow. By
Sunday, It was covered until further
notice.

More window painting is in the off-
ing as all must be completed by TueSA
day and judging will take place on
Wednesday.

The Saturday group set a good tone
for the others to emulate.

The schedule for the entire week is a

“One ofthc stanling achievements
oftlie papacy ofiohn Paul II has been
in the area ofinlerreligiousdialogue,"
Kasimow said, “More than any of his
predecessors, John Paul ll has consis-
tently and boldly initiated dialogic re—
lations with religions historically in
tension with and/or theologically ig-
nored by Roman Catholicism, such as
lslam and Buddhism. The purpose of
this book is to examine the pope's

a new introductory course in history
that will be genuinely cross-cultural in
terms of geographical, cultural and
chronological breadth," said Marci
Sonor, associate professor of history
atGrinnell.“Astcachers,wealsohope
to hone students‘ abilities to draw con-
nections and identify signiﬁcant dif-
ferences among cultures."

Working with other faculty, Sorror
wrote the grant application.
, The course will serve as an intro
duction to the study of history and an
invitation to further study. It also will
provide students with basic historical
skills and demonstrate that understand-
ing those separated by time, space and
culture is worthwhile, according to
Sorter.

‘Culturnl Encounters’

“Drawing on the strengths of the
department‘s faculty, we intend to in-
clude cases from South Africa, China,
Europe and the Americas, and from
periods ranging from the Middle Ages
to the 20th century,"Sortor said.“Ten3
tativcly titled ‘Cultural Encounters in
History,‘ the course will explore the
various Circumstances by which dif-
ferent peoples and cultures came into
contact and how they came to under-
standeachother, or failedtodo so,arid
eventually lived among each other.”

partment faculty involved in de-
velopment of the course are Sonor;

Surely Prairie Meadows
can afford some repairs

Reports that Prairie Meadows has lost 19 horses to injury this racing
scason pose an obvious question: Why is the track taking so long to make
repairs and thereby reducc the risk ofnne and valuable animals having to be
euthanized?

In the past, the track was anything but proﬁtable. But when the complex
bccanic Piainc Meadows Racetrack and Casino, enormous amounts of
revenue were generated icuough to allow Prairie Meadows to pay off its
debt to Polk County well ahead of schedule and to cause something ofa
windfall for county and state government.

No racetrack can be accidentr
free. When several horses are
galloping at full speed and close
together, slipups are inevitable,
But, according to national studies,
statistics suggest that a track like
Prairie Meadows might expect it)
or l2 accidentrrclated equine
dcallls, not 19 or more.

So it's clear that the Altoona
track is having its problems. th
those in charge haven't shortened

the racing season. Tllcy say it will take about a month lo complete repairs of
the track

Why wasn‘t the season postponed for that length oftimc at‘tcr spring
storms caused extensive damage? Maybe that’s 20720 hindsight, But it’s not
unreasonable to suggest that the time has now come for the lowa Racing and
Gaming Commission to halt the season so that morc needless dcatlis tlon‘t
occur.

The track should be repaired now. And there's no doubt that Prairie
Meadows can afford ilr
