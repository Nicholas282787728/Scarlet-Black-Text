InterVarsity status in limbo
Clu‘l‘stian Fellowship tries to regain status anu'dst cries Qfdt'scn’minatlbn

BY PHOEBE SILAG
StaffWriter

In a meeting Monday evening, Erin
Shoulberg ’97 and Molly Moilanen ’97 led
a discussion concerning possible reinstate-
ment of Grinnell‘s InterVarsity Christian
Fellowship (IV) as an ofﬁcial registered stur
dent group. and their reaction to it. “We
called the meeting to educate the commu-
nity." Shoulberg said. “People didn’t under
stand or Weren't aware of what was going
on We wanted to dispel any myths and her
gi mize or lnake more clear what was going
on with this issue." Shoulberg and Moilanen
estimate that 130 people attended the meete
ing, which was held at the Stonewall Ree
source Center.

During the meeting, Shoulberg read aloud
a letter that the six leaders of IV wrote on
January 21. It Included the statement, “We
do not discriminate in our leadership selec
tion on the basis of sexual orientation. but
rather on the basis of belief. Someone Who
is a homosexual, but agrees With our inter-
pretation of scripture, might well be invited

to lead in our group.”

According to All Berger ‘99. one of the
leaders of IV. the letter was meant to scrvc
as an explanation of InterVarsity’s bclicl's
“This has always been the case. but it hasn't
always been clear," Berger said. "We wrote
it down so that it would be clear for the ad.
ministration. This letter is intended to clarity
our position.

“As a fellowship we have never been or
clusronary except in leadership. It‘s always
been our intent to focus on Jesus and not on
the hot issues on campus. The issue is abottt
the way we choose out leaders, not about
who we accept."

According to Thomas Crady, Vict’xPl‘cslr
dent and Dean for Student/Affairs. there is a
possibility that InterVarsity cottld be rcinr
stated. “When we withdrew recognition. We
did it on the basts of statements made by
members of IV," Crady said. “Their lettci is
being reviewed by attorneys and discussed
by senior members of the president’s staff."

Reinstatement is contingent on the non»
discrimination policy, which states that
Grinnell “is committed to providing all of

its students, l’ncttlty. stal'f, arid visitors with
cquzil ncc to its programs, events, and fa-
C ittes,"

"[Thc litiiitliscrimiilatlon policy] IS abso.
lutciy the central issue," Cmdy said. “It is
the reason why group status was Withdrawn.

ply with our nondiscrimination policy? In
order to be reinstated. they must comply.”

"Thcrc are a lot orpeoplc in that organi»,

as pcoplc outside the organization.”
Shoulbcrg said at Monday's meeting “It's
vety grey because yes, these are homopho—
l)lC bcltcl's, and yes, they dtscr inatc against
homosexuals, but thcy are religious beliefs,
and they are protected under the discrimina-
lion policy. too. We bclicve that Grinnell
Collca should not support any organization

“We in no way wattt to attack the idea that

is about protecting the rights of the GLBT
people on this campus."

“Most of White America doesn’t under-
stand, docsn't hear the echoes of history,"
said Pulitzer Prize Winning author and former
reporter at the New York Times David Shipler
in his talk titled “The Fault Line: Black and
White in America" last Monday.

“When I returned from abroad I was
struck by how ahistorical we are. In the
Middle East, people are almost imprisoned
by the past. I asked a reporter to explain the
situation in Bosnia, and he began by saying
‘well, ill 1398...’ That wouldn’t happen here."

There is also a difference in the way blacks
and whites in America think about their his
tory, Mr. Shipler noted. “In America, there
is an expression, ‘oh, that's history,’ when
we mean something isn't important," he said.
“We have a sort of amnesia about it. Blacks
are tnore like other societies in that they feel
the weight of history. Whites tend to have a
poor sense or the past. Blacks have a better
sense. but they are sometimes imprisoned by
it, and sometimes interpret events through
the prison of the past."

Mr. Shipler’s visit to Grinnell was spon-
sored by the Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fel-
lows under the auspices of the College's
Rosenﬁeld Program in Public Affairs. Inter-
national Relations and Human Rights. The
Visiting Fellows program brings speakers
distinguished outside the academic world to
liberal arts colleges to speak, visit classes and
exchange dialogue with students and faculty.

Mr, Shipler spoke this week about rela
tions between black and white Americans,
and about relations between Arabs and Jews

spondent in Southeast Asia during the ﬁnal
stages of the Vietnam war. He later became
bureau chief in Moscow, then in Jerusalem.
He returned to Washington, DC, and left the
Times in 1988.

Mr. Shipler has written several books de-
scribing conditions in the countries he re-
ported on. He most recently ﬁnished a book
on race relations, based on extensive inter-
views in which participants discussed stereo-
types that blacks and Whites have about each
other, how the stereotypes contribute to mis»
communication and misunderstanding, and
What can be done to address the problems.

best-seller Russia: Broken Idols, Solemn
Dreams and Arab and Jew: Wounded Spir-

Ebiperimental College
broadens curriculum

BY ANDY WEIDNER
Editor-in-Cheif

The year 1997 will go down in history as
the year of expansion at Grinnell College.
Additions to the Science Building and Fine
Arts will be joined by their counterpart in
the academic curriculum today as registrar
tion takes place for Grinnell’s new student—
run Experimental College.

Registration for the nine courses ranging
from homebrewing to transpersonal psychol-
ogy will begin at 10am in the campus post
office and last until 2pm. Grinnell students,
faculty, administrators, and townspeople may
also apply via email or campus mail by 5pm
Saturday.

Courses in the Experimental College
(ExCo) will be taught by students and staff
of Grinnell College who expressed interest
in teaching a course last semester. ExCo
classes will be offered without credit this
semester. According to ExCo committee
member David Groppe ‘97, all proposed
courses were found worthy of merit. ”The
committee thought that anyone who Would
enroll in these [courses] would be making a
good investment oftheir time," said Groppe.

This is not the ﬁrst experimental college
to exist at Grinnell. Dean of the College
Charles Duke said that a similar project was
undertaken by students in the ‘705 Which met
with limited success. Mr. Duke said he was
pleased that another group ofstudents is Wille
ing to devote time and energy to a project
such as this. “I think it's good for the entire
community,” said Mr. Duke.

Contingent upon a successful outcome
this semester and in semesters to come,
Groppe said that a future goal ofExCo might
be to gain accreditation such as in Oberlin's
Experimental College. Groppe cited lack of
accreditation as a possible reason why the
previous experimental college failed at
Grinnell. Should students seek accreditation
for ExCo in the future they will need to open
lines of communication With Grinnell Col»
lege faculty because. said Groppe, “only the
faculty can propose changes in the credit
system." For now, Grinnell’s Experimental
College must rely on the dedication and come
mitmcnt of its participants to keep it up and
running.

Questions or comments about the Experi-
mental College should be directed to the
ExCo Committee at [SISYPHUS], 236-
4973, or Box 5769.
