All that changes remains the same

BY RANDALL LAHANN

About a snonrh ago, iwens so a parry as
Norris. Ar leass, lwens so she remains or
she parry. When i arrived, share were loss a
rcw scassered groups orpeople and she passy
was obviously in lss deash shrows. is was
loss, has nos soo lase. so, i nasurally assumed
shas she parry was ending because she keg
had been ﬂoated. 1 round a rrlend oimlnc
and asked him irshas was she case, He said
shas nos only were shey nos ous orbeer, shey
weren't even close. His rcsponsc was more a
siradc shan an answer. Hes a senior, like
myselr, and he just couldn’t underssand why
people were leaving if shese was ssill alcohol
lets, is was as ltshe sun had failed so rise in
she eass, she Vax suddenly worked on Friday
evenings, or Sheila suddenly rels shas maybe
itwasn't imporsans so know she name ofcv»

The Separation of Fact and Faith

BY Ton JANSON

i like Convo. I’m one orshose people who
looks forward so every Tuesday so she yellow
packcs can sell me who's coming ror Convo-
casion. So I shoughs I’d share my shoughss
aboussherecensConvocaslonlecsureglven by
John Dominic crossan, who's considered so
be she world’s rosemoss erpers on she “histori-
cal Jesus."

Crossan began his lecsure wlds a lussirsoe—
slon for she pursuis oldie “hissorioel Jesus.”
He said shas is is crlslcally imporsans so scpa»
s-sse pasables and hisrorical lacs in she bible,
bemuscslncc early slmes she perceived hissorl.
cal accuracy orssorics determined wherher or
nos Chrissianc included rhem in she bible.
Therefore, he argues, Chrisslanisy is based
upon such a fnmtwork, and us soo lase in she
game so go changing she rules.

i hope crasssn is wrong. I hope mas is is
possible so diarsge Christianiry’s emphasis on
historical accuracy, because shas emphasis adds
a dangerous dimension so raish. When relic
glons are compared by ralsh, one can easily see
shas many people and cultures have ssrong
raids. Any religion which possesses she raids or
lss people is shererore insrinsicallysnlualsle and
worshy or respecs. Based upon raids alone, is
is difﬁcult so rank or judge a religion. Many
religions acceps a mesh orssosy and hissory,
parable and lacs. chsisslanisy, however, arms
isselrwish “historical accuracy.” The hlssorlcal
approach is dangerous because hurled wishln
is are she seeds or insolerance and desposlsm.
All roo orscn hatred and greed rersiliac dress
seeds, and oppression and genocide sprous up
and choke ous human lives, religions, and culv
sures.

By nasure, she hissosloal approach thuitcs
shas some person or persons have she nud‘lor»
lsy so decide whas is hissoslcally accusasc.
When combined wish pollsioal or economic
clous, shese erperrs wield incredible power
which is chen easily abused. They arean ac.
counsable so anyone on Easds, since shey are

cry ssudens so eas lrs cowlcs The cosmic ore
derorshc campus had been dis-rushed, so,wc
proceeded so stand around she hog and seie
monizc so each oshei ahoiis how sriidenis are
dirrorens shan shey ussd so be and how worl-
dcrrul is would be so bl. able so rosiirri so she
“good ole days" when paisles ended nor by
choice, our by nccesslsy. We decided siiidersss
were just dllrersns nowadays. 1 {oh like my
grandrashsn our conversanon was nos unlike
numerous ones shas l’vc had or heard lllisycnl:

The snsolerance inherens wishln she hissori-

she Churchs desposlsin. Wish hissorical accu»

I shlnk chrisslanlsy has many redeeming
qualitics, so I hope Chrissianiiycan learn so see
specs osher religions and ciilsures. I carts soc shas
happening, shough, unsil Chrissians abandon
