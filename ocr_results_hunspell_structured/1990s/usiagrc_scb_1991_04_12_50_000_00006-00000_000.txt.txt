Watch What you say LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Students clarify views on assault

Political correctness (PC) has swept through the nation and its catn-
puses showing us how we should think and act. nic main obiectivc ot PC
is to eliminate present day stereotypes and prejudices.

One facet of PC was discussed during the Crime“ Debating Union’s
debate Wednesday of the motion “This House Favors A Campus Ban on
OffensiveExpression." The motion implies thatsuch language should not
be tolerated on campus.

But who decides what is “offensive" and how this banning can be
regulated? The motion is an honorable onei Racist remarks and other
ethnic slurs are offensive to the people they are aimed at, and the world
would deﬁnitely be a better place if such thoughts did not exist. But you
cannot control wharpeople think or say. This banning will not change ute
Views of someone who is racist. People will make “offensive" remarks
when they want to, even if they are looked down upon by soCiety.Thewziy

to change people’s opinions is not
to prevent them from saying or

doing something that is “wrong,”
but to show them an alternative.

To banoffensivelanguagewould
require theoreation otsomekindot
legislative organ, like the "thought
police," which would watch what people say and censor anyone who said
somedling“0ffcnsive." But whois going to draw this line? Moreover. who
hastilenght todraw tilts lineand detenninewhatpeoplecanor cannot say.

Last Febntary, when Zaahir Muhammed spoke, many students be-
lieved that Zaahir should not have been allowed to speak because many
of his opinions were racist and homophobic. ”the students thought that by
letting Zaahir speak. Grinnell was supporting him and his views. But, the
students' objection to Zaahir is also prejudice, Why can Zaahir not speak
his mind? His views may have been “offensive,“ but the result of his
speaeh was both awakening rind educational, about the Nation oflslam.

In 1948, when Georgeorwell wrote 1984,0rwe1l warned how a police
force that would monitor the way we think would destroy humanity. no
idea ofbanning “offensive" speech is part ofOrwell’s nightmare and is
simply a regression tn human civilization.

To the editor.

When the six members of our
Gender and Women's Studies dis-
cussion group decided to do two
workshops about sexual harass-
ment,abuseandassaultoncampus,
we did so wtth the intention of
raising campus awareness. We
wanted to heighten awareness of
the problem, de-myst‘ity the proce-
dures by which the college handles
such problems and bring these is
sues to a more personal level by
idcntitying the specter of sexual
offenses with names and faces
(though we could only do so in
terms olthe Victims, notoffcnders).
Our intent was the same when we
did the interview for last week’s
Scarlet andﬂlack, but We feel that
we were misrepresented by the
paper in both the article and the
editorial and would like to make
our posnion clear.

The first point we would like to
clarify deals with the issue of Con-
fidentiality in terms of “dead si-
lence." When we began the process
of pressing sexual assault charges
through the college, we were made
to feel that we were forbidden to
discuss the case (or even acknowl-
edgethatwcwercprcssingcharges)
with anyone for any reason, with

the possible exception of an RA or
a professional therapist. While we
never lied to our lloormatcs about
Whatwas happening, the mannarin
which the confidenuallty cluuscwas
explained to usmake usfeel uneasy
aboulexplainmg our frequent, pro-
longedabsencesfrom the floor,and
the tact that we were suddenly
spending so much time together
(we pressed charges together against
the same man). This was CSpCClLtlly
difficult and caused some bad fech
mgson the floorbecause Heather is

the SA.

Furthermore, we were led to be
lieve that it was notpen’nissible to
confide in close friends. which left
us with mixed feelings; we felt
isolated and frustrated when we
followedtherule,lindwefcltgullty

this problem at great length with

taken to ensure that in the future it
will be made clear to victims that

To the editor,

I am writing in response to last

privacy issue in sexual harassment

rule which states that anyone who
comes to them with a sexual abuse
problem must adhere to “dead sir

Dean explains grievance

To the editor,

The April 5, 1991 article
“Workshop revcnls inadequate ns-
sault polieies” misrepresents the
college's stance on sexual assault
and does not fairly relate grievance
and assault policies. Sexual assault
is a crime and an extreme personal
violation The Student Affairs staff
take these offenses very seriously,
Students have a variety of options
when filing a report or complaint
with the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs.
In situations where a student be»
lieves sexual harassment or harass
merit based on race, religion, age,
national origin, handicap or sexual
or affoctional preference has oc-
curred or that she or he has been
sexually assaulted a complaint
needs to be filed With a dcan in
Student Affairs.

thnacomplaintis filedwitha
(loaninStudentAffairs.thostudcnt
is made awtirc of the available op
tions. These include: It) filing an
incident report which will remain
on tile and may be used in for a
future hearing; to) filing a formal
Complaint through the college
which will proceed to a campus
hearingboard;andc)tilingchnrgcs
with the Grinnell Police Departs
merit.

In detailing the options, is dean
wtll advise the studentofthcappro-
priatc body to hear the case detail-
ing collcgc policy and procedures.
Thus, when a student chooses to

file a complaint, she or he will be
assisted in understanding what lies
ahead. For description ot the pelts
cics please review the Assault and
Grievances sections of the Student
Handbook,

Heterosexism: a reminder ,

To the editor,

I fool the new to write a note

In outer words “gay people tire not

I'm not saying this to condemn
the Loose Hall Ball or to cttc
anyone’s conscious homophobic
efforts. I just wanted to show how
Often the cxtstcncc of our biscxual/
