there can be no crossvlisting (ap-
plying credits from either math or
computer science to both depart»
ments), adouble major in math and
computer science is nearly impos- ,
sibIC.

“Perhaps there are more protec-
tions against undermining the libs
cral arts in this major," he said.
Walker added that the advising
program encourages students to
take courses beyond the major dis-
cipline. Students are further lim-

‘ited by the maximum48 credits Ihat

can be taken’wiihin the major Ide-
partment and applied toward the
major. _

Dean of Faculty Charles Duke
stressed that the proposals do not
greatly alter the current curricu-
lum. “We didn‘tsee this as a revo-
lutionary change." he said. “It‘s a '
relabeling within the department, a
simple evolution of what we have
now. It makes more sense."
