Computer Services LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
West sets poor example

creates Chain gang

Computer Service’s recent decision to revoke mail privrleges from 16
students brings to light the utter fragility under which the computer system
operates at Grinnell. Students have the ability the bring the entire system
crashing down by the simplest means. But is this really what students want?
Did the students who sent twenty sexually oriented chain mail letters to
friends have covertmalevolentintentions? The answer isquite obviously no.

The VAX system at Grinnell is
something utilized by nearly every
student. Since the slightest glitch in
the system can have widespread im~
plications, it is obvious that preserva»

Lion must be insured. Furthermore,
rules and regulations governing the
system must be made resoundingly clear.

Computchcrvices, however. has yetto achievethis. Instead, they choose
to swoop down from their thrones and revoke student mail privileges. This
actin itselfis not entirely unfounded. Some students can and Will abuse the
system. But many students reacted with shock when they received a
typewritten letter (how ironic) from Computer Services outlining lheircri me
and punishment.

Computer Services could avoid these woes by an increased effort to
educate students. If computer regulations were taught in a more "user
friendly" manner, complications would undoubtedly decrease.
Moreover, if general restrictions were posted in each computer lab, students
would have little recourse to argue over punishment received.

Lamenting over the morality ofsending chain mail is moot. The attention
of the current situation will make clear the illicit nature of this activity. But
there are a multitude of other activities which can similarly disable the
computer system. It is in the collective best interm to avoid these situations
in the future by increasing overall awareness

To the editor,

lam writing in response to Shelly
West‘s Feb. 28m column. I agree
wiLh Ms. West that blancoheleropa-
Lriarchy sucks. It is extremely diffir
cult to live in a world where you are
oppressed because of your race, gene
der or sexual preference. Even at
Grinnell, these are serious problems
on a day-to-day basis. Yet I ltnd my-
self far from pleased with any of Ms.
West's columns, especially this one.

Phrases like“. . ,andall these men.
Yuck"hardlyendearmetoMs.West’s
point of view. This is but one ex-
ample in lnany of blatant sexism in
Ms. West’s most recent column. It is
no doubt true that females are the
subject ofa great many more sexist
comments than men, but that hardly
Jusufiesany sexism. IfI wrote“..and
all these women, Yuck" (especially if
I spelt it that way), I would most
likely be crucified at the Zirkle the
next morning, and rightly so. How-

ever, Ms, West’s type of reverse dis
crimination frequently goes
unchecked at Grinnell. It is also the
kind of reverse discrimination that
fuels false justiﬁcations for patriar-
chy.

Iwould furlhcrcllljm thatMs.West
does little to promote the reputation
ofthelesbrgaycommunityatGrinnell
by insinuating that in being homo-
sexual, one necessarily isrepulsed by
members of the oppostlc sex. This is
the kind of myth lesbigays have been
trying to eliminate. It is the kind of
myth which has always perpetuated
homophobia.

Ms. Westgoeson tocriticizeSGA
senators for being “white boys," a
character trait which at my most re-
cent observation they couldn’t help.
If a white male wishes to run for
senator. he should do so, just as a
black male, or white or black female
should. It is possible that underlying
prejudicesdonothelp females,blaeks

or homosexuals obtain senatorial po-
srtions (although there are many
dorms where only one person runs),
but that is not the fault of the white
male senators.

In sum,disci‘lmination bringsaboul
more discrimination, The only way
discrimination can be stopped is by a
sincere desire for cqtmlity from ev-
eryone. It is no coincidence that the
individual arguably mostresponsible
for improving the conditions or an
oppressed group in this cenutry, Dr.
Martin Lulhcr King believed that we
Shouldloveeven thosewhopersecute
us. even while refusing to accept that
persecution, We must tolerate all
people, if we are truly ever going to
be able to cure the greatest of social
diseases.nomattcrhowrepulsivethcy
seem to us. Ms. West's column does
not make strides in this direction.

I hate being a "white male pig"

To the Editor,

You Know I Really Hate Being A
Conservative, Racist, Sexist.
Homophobia Nazi, Oppressive,
While Male Pig.

Well ifthe truth be lcnown, I don't
even know what the hell that means.
If the people on this campus care, I
am very happy and damn proud of
whoarid whatIam.Ifyou can'ttell by
now, I am a conservative, straight,
white male. As for all those isms and
phobias, I coulnd't tell. I am ajunior
at this college and have spent the last
three yearsmindin g my own business
as kneevjerk liberal hypocrites and
reactionary right-wingers have told
me what an asshole Iam because] do
not fitintolheirrigidly defined terms
of what is right and moral in this
world. I think that since I have been
here] have been accused of: the hei-
nous practice of slavery in the US,
the molestation of every woman and
child on this planet, the plight of all
Third World countries, and the gen-
eral disorder and associated evils that
go along with living in an imperfect
world. Well, when I reﬂect on these
accusations I have to stop and won,
der, When did I have time to perpe-
trate all these evils upon an unsus-
pecting world? I could have sworn
that my parents weren’t even born
when Hitler came to power. Just last
week Ithoughtl was writinga history
paper when I was allegedly raping
fortyrthrce women in six different
slam. I guess I had more time on my
hands than I knew. (Maybe I’ll forgo
beating up all those gayrrights activ-
ists next week and sleep in.)

Let me make something clear be-
fore I continue. I do not condone
actions like those I have mentioned
above, I believe forcible sex (rape) is
a terrible act to perpetrate on some-
one simply to live outone’s own sick
need for domination or sexual plea~

sure. I also believe homosexuals
should enjoy the same rights as ev-
eryone else does, not more or special
rights, just the same. The point I’m
trying to make here is this: do not
accuse me and the rest of the white
male race for perpetuating the crimes
of the century when you should first
be analyzing your own hypocritical
and oltcn deu-imcntzil viewpoints and
actions.

Whatmanyofyou high and mighty
liberals consider the correct or P.C.
way to conduct yourself is no better
that an oppressive doctrine that will
hinder, not help, whatever cause you
are striving for, It seems the overrid-
ing beliefs on this campus stem from
the desire for diversity, equality. and
open-mindedness for all people. But
by your very actions you are inhibit-
ing and trying to oppress those of us
who don’t bow down to your altar of
liberal ideology. In class, if the pro-
fessor and the students Start going off
about sexism, racism. etc. andI speak
up with a conﬂicting viewpoint, nay
any viewpoint, I am promptly put
down with a myriad of varying isms
and phobias, informing me that I
would not understand because I am a
patheuc,uncaring,insensitive,power-
hungry,white man. lam thus damned
for being born. It is becoming painr
fully obvious that intellegent, logical
discussion on important topics is be-
coming almost impossible on this
campus without radical liberals and
reactionary conservatives divinginto
anamecallingcontcstoften supported
by questionable facts and figures or
just plain downright stupid and hes
tile personal opinions,

I would like to conclude by saying
I love this school and all it has done
for me. The professors and people I
have met and had conmct wtth have
enriched my life to the point where
$18,000 a year seems like a trifle

sum. WhatI hate to see is a respected
institution of higher learning brought
down by insensitive and overbearing
hypocrites from both'sides of the po»
litical spectrum. The air you people
have created on this campus has and
will continue to cause more harm to
the learning and exchanging of ideas

chain mail
harmful

To the editor.

Recently, 16 students were cen-
sured by GCCS because they for
warded an electronic “chain letter" to
one or more receivers at Grinnell or
another college campus to which we
are networked. This letter addresses
several questions that students have
asked meaboutthe recenlchainlelter
incident.

Sevemlsludents askedwhy GCCS
censured students by stopping their
Ercommunications for30days.Chain
letters appear harmless, but they are
not The body of the most recent
chain letter recommended that each
receiver send the note to 20 other
people and that these 20 in turn send
to another 20, and so on. To give you
a rough idea of how quickly the num-
bers could rise, a simple calculation
reveals that if this chain “successr
fully"cont.inued forjustthreegencmr
tions,ovcr8.000 DREAMS messages
would be generated. While it is true
that not everyone who receives a let-
ter will send it out to multiple receiv-
