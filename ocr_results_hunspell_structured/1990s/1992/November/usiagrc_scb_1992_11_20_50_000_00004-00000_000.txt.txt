Grinnell Theater production primarily a success

by Kendra Ford and
Michael Kavanagh

The Grinncll Theater
Department’s production of Henrik
Ibsen's A Doll House is essentially a
success.SusanMcBumey‘s portrayal
of the Nora Helmer character was
very believable. Nora is trapped in an
unhappy man-iage and constrained
byexceptionally stringentsocialconr
ventions, until she decides to forsake
these limitations by leaving her mar-
ried life behind and to seek a new life
of her own.

At the beginning of the play,
Nora is mem'ly ignorant, or unobser-
vantof her condition. But a situation
involving a debt with a bank forces

her to noticethesocialoppression she
has always experienced, and she be
comes increasingly flantic as Lime
goes on. Her character grows more
and more desperate, until the tension
isalmostunbeamble.McBurney con-
veys the development from Nora as
her husband’s “little songbird" to a
confused, heartbroken, yet hopeful
woman in search ofherown Indepen—
dence. This developmentclimaxes to
the last and best scene in the play,
where Nora levels with her husband
and explains exactly why she cannot
remain married to him. This scene
makes the play a success~McB urney
is entirely believable in her protest,
andJonathanCook,whoplaysNora’s
husband Torvald, is earnest in his
surprise and his defeat.

The failure of the Helmer's mar-
riage is balanced by the blooming of
another relationship between Nora's
friend. Mrs. Linde and an employee
of’forvzlld‘s bank,Nils Krogstad.This
relationship is somewhat unbelievr
able, both in its scenario and in the
relationship between the actors.
Krogstad is not personified in such a
way that he is involved oraffected by
the love which Mrs. Linde expresses
for him. It seems painfully obvious
that the two characters are simply
plot functionaries. Mrs. Linde's char
acter was well portrayed, she was
steady and earnest. Krogstad's char-
acter,though energettc,suffcrcd from
over-earnestness.

One of the moments of lcvity in
the show was the briefappeaiance by

expensive feature produced in France
to that date. Shooting involved the
reconstruction of the mime Baptiste
Dubrau’s theater “Funambules” and
a quarter-mile section of the boule—
vard du Temple, known as the Boule-
vard of Crime because it had a record
of colorful murders and violence of
every sort.

Children of Paradise is redolent
of the 18th Century French theater;
the title itself suggests the gallery
(termed “paradise") where the greater
public, like gallery gods, sat to see
plays performed. Much of the film's
action takes place during the presen-
tation of a play, both backstage and
on-stage, outdoors (where the ‘ gods’
assembled), and indoorsifrom eve
