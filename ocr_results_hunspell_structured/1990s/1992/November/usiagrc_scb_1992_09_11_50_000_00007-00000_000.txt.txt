GETTING TESTED

So we decided that we would go
and get tested. We all wenttogclher
so we could talk about what hap-
pened and help each other with the
inevitable anxiety. We went to get an
HIV test: we realized that it was the
only responsible thing to do. First
thing we went to the Health Centerto
get information on tsstcites. And the
Health Center was ready [or us It is
possible to get tested in town, if you
have $330 for laboratory fees. When
we all gasped at that fee the nurse on
duty handed us a prepared list of
testing sites. All of the nearby Health
Departments are listed as test sites
but the highlighted location was the
Iowa City Free Medical Clinic, 120
N. Dubuquc Street.

We called the Free Medical Clinic
(319-337-4459) and made appoint—
ments for ourselves. We had some
difficulty getting to talk to a pcrson
(and not an answering machine) but
when we ﬁnally did they were very
helpfulr The woman who answered
the phone asked me if] would like to
make up aname under which to make
theappoinunent. Thiswasthe ﬁrstof
many incidents in which thcstaffwas

scrupulously careful about confiden-
tiality. They are highly sensitive to
the very real problem of prejudice
against people who have been found
to have HIV. Appointments were
available Tuesday and Wednesday
and Monday and Thursday evenings.
We made evening appointments for
then next week. Each appointment
was scheduled l'orhalf an hour, though
they said that they would vary de4
pending on how many questions were
asked The Free Clinic explained
that they require relatively complete
pre-counseling, including extensive
“safesex” education.

Though we arrived as a group the
counselor said that the rules ofconfi-
dentiality can‘t allow clients to be
seen in groups. After the counselor
explained the test and reiterated the
confidentiality the counselor asked
me why I decided to be tested. After
Istuttered around foraminute or two
he began to explain what practices

is highly risky for either men or
women Sure,surc,we allknow that.

can College Health Association task
Force on AIDS which says,“’i'he risk
of oralrgenital sex on a man seems
much lower, and oral sex is less risky
ifitstops before ejaculation. Oralsex
on a female may be more risky dur-
ing menstruation." It is not yet clear
whether body ﬂuids such as saliva
and prerejaculatory ﬂuids can pass
on the virus, though there are no
known cases of such transmission.

Finally we had to fill out a slate
demographics survey about age and
sexual practices and sign a release
form (a form simply stating that we
understood the test and that it would
kept confidential) with our assumed
name. Then our test sheet was as-
signed a number and I was taken to
the lab to have my blood drawn.

We asked how much these tests
really cost. Theinitial test costs $35.
It is not the most reliable test avail-
able and sometimes givw false posi-
tives. [fa blood test comes out posi-
live. the blood ts run through the
same test again. Ifit is still positive
then it is run through a more precise.
and more expensive, test.

But the most important thing we
learned is what we need to do to
prevent the spread of HlV. Several
of us realized that it is essential that
we make serious lifestyle changes. It
is life threatening to continue under
any assumption that HIV/AIDS is
something which is not a risk to us in
this relatively enclosed community.
Lifestyle changes include not having
sex with everyone whom you FEEL
like having sex, use condoms and
dental dams scrupulously and being
knowledgeable about your partners
sexual history. You heard this all
before; you know itby heart But are
you ACTING on it? Driving in Iowa
City and getting blood draw from our
arms helped us to realize that these
issues are not simple questions which
“take the romance out of sex” but life
and death questions. We found that
some of the practices we enjoyed
were damn risky behaviors. We also
learnedsometerriiyingslatistics,such
as, 75% of the newlydiagnosed cases
are women between the ages of 18
and 35, that's us women. that‘s you
and me and your ﬂoormate. So next
week we go back {or the results.
We’re not going to tell you what the
results are. perhaps you won’t know
how to react. But we hope that you
assess your own risk behavior and
responsibly. for yottrown health and
others.
