Feminist approach to Greek tragedies proves disappointing

 

by Paul Knipe

After first seeingBmzil, a friend
once said he feltpatanoid and claus-
trophobic. The comment may sound
strange to someone who is unfamil-
iar with the ﬁlm’s futuristic hell of
monstrous high-rises, recreational
terrorist activity, cosmetic surgery
accidents and outlaw plumbers. But
for anyone who has had the patience
to endure this comic masterpiece of
visual style and social satire. it’s a
fairly accurate description.

Brazil was directed by the ex-
Monty Python genius of magical
excess, Terry Gilliam. and is a cin-
ematic combination of George
Orwell’s I984. Kaﬂra’s The Trial
and a mythic romantic fable. In an
ominous urban wasteland, the nar-
rative centers around Sam Lowery.
a middle-aged man living a slave—
like existence in an oppressive po-
litical bureaucracy, He spends his
days reviewing administrative
records and ﬁlm and spends his
nights dreaming of ethereal ﬂights
with angels. When not otherwise
occupied, he sweats through awk-
ward meetings with his surgery-ad-
dicted motherand agonizes over the
plumbing in his apartment.

Several ironic subeplots are in-
cluded to accentuate the film’s at-
mosphere of claustrophobia, para-
noia and comicvbook playfulness.
An innocent family man is accused
of an unnamed crime and dragged
away from his wife and children on
ChristrnasEveby‘"I‘houghtPolice.“
A young terrorist plans her revenge
against the system while appearing
each night as an angelic goddess in
Sam Lowery’s fanlasies. Arenegade
plumber swings from skyscraper to
skyscraper, breaking intoapartrnents
and holding the occupants at gun-
point while he repairs their air con—
ditioning and water systems.

The excitementofwatchingBrur
zr'l doesn‘t come from a compelling
plot, psychological twist or any of
the conventional elements. In faCt.
only a threadbare connection exists
from one scene to the next. The
absence of acoherentstory or plot is
so outrageouslybialantlhatthe chaos
itself is immensely entertaining. The
cast is also outstanding. British ac-
torJonathanPryceis perfectlyinno-
cent and likeableasbowery. Robert
DeNiro, Bob Hoskins, Ian Holm,
Michael Palin and Katherine
l-Ielmond provide hilarious cameos.

Brazil has been called a
contemporary classic, Upon its
completion in 1985, Universal
Pictures found it so offensively
excessive that in threatened to cancel
its release. In response. Terry
Gilliam collected various ﬁlm critics
and writers for a secret screening.
From there, Gilliarn’s supporters
intimidated the studio into laying
down. ThespEculative ﬁction writer
Harlan Ellison cited Brazil as the
bat film he’d ever seen. calling it a
work of “chilling brilliance.”

It all began when I learned from a
couple of friends that a few tickets
were stillavailable for the August29
theater trip to the Guthrie in Minne»
apolis to see a premiere regional rep-
ertory company‘s adaptation of three
Greek tragedies. These plays were
based on lhe story of Clytemncstra,
who murders her husband
Agamemnon in retribution for his
murder of their daughter Iphigenia.
This was one of the most sensational
events in the gender polidcs of clas-
sical tragedies.

In that last paragraph are the four
main reasons I decided to go. al-
though I had to wake up early on a
Saturday morning. The ﬁrst reason
consists of genuine curiosity: how
can Greek tragedies that I thought I
knew a little about be conjugated
suddenly in gender form in this day
and age? Itbeat me at the time, and it
still does, but I read later that
“Clytemncstra’s celebrated protest
against women's subordinate status
and her ultimate defeat at the hands
of the patriarchal status quo [was]
particularly timely since Marilyn
Quayle, political pundit and philoso-
pher ofhuman nature, [had] recently
declared that ‘most women do not
wish to be liberated from their essen-
tial nature.m Hot, isn’t it?

The second motivation is simply
lhatl love theater in all its forms and

the Guthrie enjoys a reputation thati
finally had the chance to judge by
myself.

My third incentive resides in the
concretization of the oath that I had
made to myselfof trying to stay con»
nected with theoutside worldas much

"This was one of the
most sensational
events in the
gender politics of
classical tragedies."

awkward, but it is a reality that it is

Iastbutnotleast, this trip sounded
likean excellent opportunity to spend
the weekend with good friends. keep—
ing in mind that one of them cel-
ebrated his twentyefirst birthday on
the same day.

The trip was organized by Ellen

of our theatrical trip to the Twin
Cities. .

Yes. I was disappointed by the
performance. I discovered a new
genre of Greek tragedy bastardized
with modern American theater. di»
luted with pseudo»feminism that
came out to be either too naive or
much too far-fetched, resulting in a
overall disappointment: the play was
not innovative enough to strike and
not classical enough to be respected.
The actors were average, with the
only exception of the astounding
Isabell Monk who played
Clyremnestra with a beautiful voice
'and presence My criticism of all the
rest (costumes. masks, directing,
lighting, etc.)' would be boring be
cause of the same calibre: average.
The only aspect worth commenting
upon is the gender issue of the play.

We realized immediately. for it

,was obvious. that all male charac-

ters—Agamemnon, the Old Man.
Menelaus. the various messengers,
andmostofallthemalebimbo Achil-
les—wcre depicted in a very radical
feminist fashion. Their words and
actionswerealmosttooearicatural to
be true. to the point that to the neo-
phyte it would be Very difﬁcult to
understand why these characters be-
camesoimmenselypopularthrough-
out history.

I personally hated these so called

hilarious commons by female charv
acters on men‘s behavior or words,
comments Lhatmen are not supposed
to understand because of a female
innuendo. These comments resulted
in astupid characteristic semi»laugh-
ter rather than intelligently opening
the discussion.

Finally, whereas the plot through-
out rhe three plays was faithful to
what I remembered from my high
school literatureclasses.theﬁnaloff—
stage comment by an already dead
Clytemnestra, “Women arise!"
proved tobe so outof place, so nnrul
and without any connection to the
end of the play itself, that I realized
my ﬁrst impression was true. There
was never any inﬂuence on our mod»
em societies. How could there be
anyway? I honestly doubt it was the
intention of Euripidm. Aeschylus or
Sophocles. However. the simple fact
that their plays can be used today to
support feminist ideas proves that
they were not the macho misogynists
some people think they were.

Now, I would like to be consider-
ale to the work everyone involved in
the plays put forth to make them
professionaland visually enjoyable I
wish I could have seen a radically
new approach to Greek tragedy, or a
version really true to tradition. ltwas
somewhere in-between in each as
pect. I

I realize how deceiving this ar-
ticle can be. but myown four reasons
to be happy about this trip were ful-
ﬁlled. Ijust hope that nexttime I will
feel this overwhelming need locom-
ment on the substance rather than on
the form.

More Than You Imagined

German film series continues

TheGem-tan Women inFilmandPolitics Series continuesnextWednes-
day with Locked Up Time. In 1984. East German ﬁlmmaker Sibylle
Schonemann was arrested and imprisoned for the “crime” of having
requested an exit visa. A few months after the Berlin Wall came down she
returned to East Germany with camera and crew to take up the trail of her
denunciation and prosecution.

Brazen and tireless in her search for those responsible, she confronted
members of the secret police. court and prison ofﬁcials, and even fellow
workers. I-Icr demeanor shows traces of compassion beneath the outrage
as she presses for truth and admission of guilt

The ﬁlm at times turns comic, then tragic, then infuriating,butis always
moving. Locked Up Time succeeds brilliantly in capturingtheaftermath of
East Germany's communist legacy.

Locked Up Time is sponsored by the Performing Arts Program; the
Louise R. Noun Program in Women‘s Studies; and the Rosenfield Pro
gram in Public Affairs. International Relations and Human Rights. Show»
ing time is Wednesday. September 16 at 9:30 pm. in the Harris Cinema.
