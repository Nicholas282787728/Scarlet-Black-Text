speech stressed the many problems
with today's American health care
system and the underlying causes of
poverty and greed. It was the patient
that "expected perfection“ that lies
behind the health care crisis, rather
than the greed of doctors and hospi-
tals. Koop stated as he called for a

"spiritual solution." He also predicted
that the AIDS threat and the growing
elderly population were serious men-
aces to the system, along with lesser
problems of insurance costs and high
numbers of malpractice suits, Koop
advocated "broad changes across the
board." but warned that changes
would take more than one adminis»
nation, about a decade. if everything
ran smoothly, oiwhich he denied the
possibility. After the speech Koop
met with members of the audience at
a reception in South Lounge.

Student Jessica Rail spoke for the
college's Multi Ethnic Coalition, mention-
ing Archie Banker's Neighborhood as one
aruongthesofarsuccessrul undertakings of
the coalition’s attempts to raise awareness
on issues otdirretenec. “We need to organ
nize a committee of high school students
that would be concerned with the same
issue," said Ruff, “this way their work will
be carried on year titer year."

At this point, the meeting seemed to
berunning in circles. with peoplerepeating
one alter another that something has to be
done. In an attempt to make the discussion
more fruitful, White suggested that the
City‘s Safety Committee meet with repre-
sentatives or the college and the schools
and discuss public speaking on the prob
lem. White also mentioned a number of
places where the input of citizens could be
sought—such places as bank newsletters,
service clubs and KGRN. White said he
wanted to make a motion for a specific
wttrsc of action Io be devised, but for no
obvious reason, the rest of the council sug-

°s in g
gested tttar a motion was not necessary.
With conuolled dissatisfaction with
the course that the meeting was taking,
Siddiqui once again urged: “Don’t keep
talking and talking. Dosomething. Follow

people ottlris town elected you: they look
up ID you and expecr you to take action

tor unity nowl lryou disagree with us, just
let us know. so that we know we're on our
own, Otherwise, do something!"

Maxine McConnell, council member
1st ward, replied that a motion was not
needed. “What we need to do. is invite any
interested people to come toapublic, brain-
storming meeting on the issue.”

Council membeand wardFitzgemld.
replied that thesarety Committee is open to
the public. White urged that no Satcty
Committee should put a speciﬁc course of
action on the agenda within 30 days. City
Clerk PamRupp, assured thatshe would get
togetheralistor groups and individuals that
shouldbcinvited to theSaiety Committee's
brainstorming session. At this point, just
about when the issue was to becalled to an
end. student Shayma Sayid stepped up to
the and made a request that the issue of
homophobia, one that I had tarot-git up in
last week’s meeting, not beoverlooked, A
chilling silence of about ten seconds {ole
lowed Sayid‘s words and then. without fur»
thcrdelay, thecouncil proceeded to the next
business orthcday'sagenda. Atthatpoint
the people trorn the college ten the room.

Commenting on the meeting.Sidcliqui
said afterwards that he is not at all satisﬁed
with the situation. because, “unless wekeep
coming and bugging them again and again,
they won'tdo anything, And we‘ll bebaclt.
for as many times as needed."

Steve Schneiter‘s post-meeting corn-
mentwas thattlrepossibilrty ofapolicy that
would encourage creative sanctioning in»
stead of punishment. is the only important
thing that came up in the Monday's meet.
ing. Schnelter admitted that he subscribes
to Siddtqui's dissatisfaction with the way
the City Cotmcil seems to be dealing with
the issue.

More news—although notveryptorn.
isingi should be expected on this issue.
