Lecture on Multiculturalism emphasizes personal as well
ias institutional approaches toward a nonracist society

By India Weston

The subject of multicultumlism
' was yet again the topic of discussion
, this past Tuesday evening in South
Lounge. The speakerT'iRudy Sims,
‘ Regional Directorofthelowa Region
i of the National Conference of Chris-
tians and Jews. The titlcii"Moving
‘ Towards A Multicultural Society."
4 Speaking in front of an entirely
_ black audience, Sims focused on
multiculturalism from two perspec»
. lives, individual and organizational.
, In terms ofthe individual, Sims made
the assumption that upbringing in the
‘ United States innately entailed a lot
‘ of misrniormation regarding one's
history. Growing up as an African-
‘ American, he had the same stereo—
,. types of blacks as whites, but has
come to accept the responsrbrlrly of
‘ looking at things “more rationally us
i Imature.”
On the subjectof lhc meltrng pol.

sometimes “slip up and have to be

williinthe country.Why should blacks
defend the Japanese because of un-
derlying racism associated within that
relationship? “We live in a small
world,“ replied Sims. and no one
knows who is next in line. “We can't
allow ourselves to tolerate hate."

A reﬂection upon a race relations
survey added an interesting aspect to
the talk. The survey of youth, which
was taken a couple of years ago, con-
sisted of persons 15 to 24 years of age
who were of each racial group, Ev-
eryone, including whites, felt they
had been affected by discrimination.
55% of thehlacksdid notbelieve they
had been discriminated against. 90%
of all groups felt there would be ime
provement ifpeople would take more
responsibility inbetten'ng society,ond
70% of these people felt they had an
“exceptional” close friend of another
race.

Sims went on to discuss various
progrsseive stages of Euro-Ameri-
