'Staunclt Iiberal' thanks outgoing Vice President

by Howard Horn

I am a staunch liberal, and I am
not afraid to admit it. Despite this
fact,Iwouldliketothanksomepeople
who will be losing theirjobs January
20. One person I would like to thank
is Dan Quayle.

'Apa thy'
To the editor:

Every year at Grinnell, someone
makes a big deal about student apa»
thy. The problem with this concern is
that they confuse apathy with having
a life of your own. If someone calls
you apathetic it just means that you
care about different things. There is
certainly nothing wrong with caring
about different things and having difv
fcrcnt priorities; after all, Grintiell is
supposed to support diversity.

As far as professors are con
cemed. saying that they ought to be
concerned is no different than pro-
posing thatyouknow how to think for
anyothermemberofthecampus com
munity. We are supposed to be free

This is notanother editorial sarr

choice, and is entirely independentof
the professor or the rest of the class.
While helping to search for Tammy
Zywicki was certainly a worthwhile
and noble effort, it is not up to the
professors or anyone else who is not
participating to aid those who are.

Ward blasts vile robber

To the heathen dog who stole my
stuff may s/he spend the rest of their
daysinahelllhatwould makeGenghis
Khan quiver in fear:

I would be the firstto admit that
perhapsIamatadbitnaiveanddumb
(okay...really naive and dumb), per
haps his silly ofme to imaginethat in
a campus of 1200 students such a
thing as honor and honesty exist.
Perhaps itis true thatin mylifelhave
not been a totally honest person and
have. as I would say, liberated some
objects from some eenain groups or
corpeiations thati felt would notmiss
them in the least (though i would like
itnoted that the charges weredropped,
contrary to popularbelief). Allthisis
true but I felt I should preface this
with a little background on my situa-
tion. What I’m getting atis someone
ripped me off. Somebody wandered
into my room, not a difficult task.
conSidering i've locked my room
probably 20 times in the past three
andahalfyears,andtooksomeofmy
stuff. Itwas notalogical theft. They
didn’t take my stereo (bought from a
pawn shop for fifty buckscash) or my
cd’s lying around the floor. They
ignored my neon pink wallet on the
desk and my walkman next to it.
They even ignored my Degas printon
the wall (okay...not really.,.but if I
had one, they probably would have
ignored it). Some piece of bottom-
sucking-rivervslimc wandered into my
room and stole twenty bucks and my
baubles. Now if you don’t know me
well you might not understand the
significance of this act. You might
think it petty of me to worry about
twenty bucksand some noeklacesand
things. But if you know me well I
think you will apprecrate this a bit

more. You see, I love my baubles.
Look at my neck on any given day
and I guarantee i’ll bewearing atlcast
a few. I don’t even care about the
twenty dollars. Cash is no big deal to
me.Iearn it andlspend it,I’m sureI
would have wastcditanyway. Butto
have bothered to rip off a couple of
cheap necklaces and some whistles (I
like whistles and they’re gone) is
lower then low. Perhaps its petty of
me to won'y about my worthless little
baubleswhensomeone’swritinghate
messages on south campus or some
toadoid vermin is setting fire to
somebody’s couch. But I feel all
these actions are indicative ofaprob-
lem that has been growing on this
campus for some time now. This
campus is starting tochange. Perhaps
it is for the better in some ways:
people study more, and drink less.
But in other ways this campus is
changing for the worse. People are
starting to take themselves more and
more seriously every year, they are
smrting to stress more and more for
smaller and smaller reasons. Maybe
it is true that I‘m just a jaded and
cynical senior who is just
romantteising about the goodroldr
days. But for a while now I’ve been
noticing thatthiscampusseemsmore
and more stressed and less and less
happy. Perhaps it is nothing more
than my imagination. But i do know
that after three and a half years of
Lrustingmy neighborsand fellowstu—
dents, I finally got burned. And to
whomever ripped my stuff, ifl ever
seeyouwearing mybaubles,youwill
ruethedaythatyouwereeverbrought
into this world. you worthless sack of
putrid dog vomit.

to have less lawyers (Quayle is an
attorney himselD, or the fact that he
once said in reference to the United
Negro CollegeFund something to the
effect that “a mind is a terrible thing
to waste, and so is not having one."
Instead, I would like to legitimately
thank Dan Quayle for the work that
he has done in his tenure as Vicc~
President.

A lot of people have a miscon-
ception about politics. They think
that anyone who wants to run for a
majorofficeiscorruptthatmostpoli-
licians are in politics not to help their
country but to better themselves.
Many believe that politicians have
been stricken with an addiction to
power.

This is not the case. A great
tnajority of the politician in Amerir
can government do their job for the
bettertnent of their country. Their

main drive is to serve the people.
Quayle is a good example of this,

Every day, the David
Letterman‘s. Johnny Carson’s, and
every political cartoonistwitha news-
paper circulation greater than two
would poke fun at Quayle’s lack of
refinement. They attributed this to a
lack of intelligence. Quayle gradu-
ated law school and passed the BAR
Exam. This is more than can be Said
for most of the satirtsts and cartoon-
ists of the United States.

Quayle put up with all the ridi-
cule. He did this not so thathe could
satinte his hunger for power. He did
itso that he could further his ideals as
for what is best for the country he
loves.

To a liberal, including thyself.
his work was harmful. The only
positive thing] can remember that he
did (besides providing Lloyd Benson

the set-up for the classic onerliner
“Senator, you‘re noJack Kennedy,”)
was to warn GeorgeBush of theprob-
lems that occurred with the Kurds in
Iraq. This fact is unimponant.

I thank Dan Quayle for the fact
that he served his country. Even
though he thought that homosexuals
should not serve in the military and
that women do not dmerve the right
to an abortion, he believes these things
because he believes they were the
rightforAmerica. Youandleanonly
say the same things about our ideals.

Let Dan Quayle be a lesson to
America: when criticizing a political
opponent. attack their stand on the
issues. It is unwise to attack their
motives, For the great majority of
politicians: liberals, conservatives.
Democrats, and Republicans, the
motive is the same.

The alienation of Middle America

In an essay in this journal, Riva
Sharples praises Malcolm X as art in-
spiring champion of downtrodden
blacks, Malcolm‘s anti-white racism,
she assures us. did not survive his
youth.

But it appears that Mr. X hated
whites until the very end of his life. In
a speech he delivered just before his
death, hecalledwhites“bigwhttcapes"
and charged Iliatlhey“lovelokill."He

in the short time before his death,
(“Malcolm X In His Own Wor ,”
Human Events, December 5, 1992)

Ms. Sharplm’s article betrays a
less than thorough knowledge of the
attitudes and exploits of its subject.
Still, I am glad that the piece was
published, for it does present some
evidence in support of its claims—
unlike much of the treacle that ﬂows
through these pages.

In his letter in the last issue of this
newspaper,ScouWiustruckcomplains
that I myself have failed to make a
”worthwhile response" to my critics’
letters and articles. Let’s look at some
of these (presumably “worthwhile")
items: Todd Erler’s letter explicitly
urging students tobum mynewspaper.
the GrinnellSpecmior; Papa Owusu’s
article insulting me personally; Tricia
Felin’s letter stating that my column is
a reminder of the reality of racism;
Melissa Laird‘s letter stating—well,
l’m not sure exactly what it states. I
wish Mr. Wittsiruck could understand
that I can’t make a substantive re»
sponsetoitemsthatdon‘tsayanything
substantive, or that aren't even com
prehensible.

If Mr. Wittsouckobjects to shoddy
journalism, then it’s curious that he
doesn‘t complain about Papa Owusu,

whoconslanlly producesit. Mr. Owusu was

has published a demonstrable lie—
iltat I have ”argued that blacks are

inferior, citing low academic achieve
merit." He also has responded to argue
menu thatI have made by claiming in
his column thatl have “no social life.”
Is that a serious, “worthwhile" re-
sponse?

Moreover, he often gets the facts
wrong, or deliberately lies. For ex-
ample, he claimed that the editor of the
Dartmouth Review quoted Hitler in an
editorial intl‘tatjoumal. Hitler hasnever
been quoted in an editorial in the Re-
view, Somebody whose identity has
not been established secretly inserted a
Hitler quotation into the masthead of
the newspaper. The Anti-Defamation
League ofB’nai Brith, after scrutiniz-
ing the case, decided that this person
was probably an enemy of the paper,
rather than the black editor.

Most of Mr. Witutruck‘s letter is
a list of the journalistic sins I have
committed—suggesting that Marxism
might be a flawed theory, defending
Michael Levin’s right to teach, admit-
ting that David Duke, although evil,
understands the plight of Middle
Americans. and suggesting that crack
and violent crime might have some-
thing lo do with the misery of black
Americans. What does all this mean?
Mr. Wittsiruck doesn’t know. He can
only tell us, repeatedly, that it “means
something.” Let us applaud his powers
of perception.

It should not be hard to under
stand the difference between support-
ing David Duke and admitting that,
evil though he may be, he has an excelr
lent grasp of the problems of Middle
Americans. He does understand quite
well that the inﬂux of immigrants into
the workforce brings about lower
wages; that crime is making the cities
uninhabitable; that the leadership of
the country doesn‘t have any notion of
what's ailing Middle Americans.

During the orgy of looting and
murder in Los Angeles,PresidentBush
went on television to announce that he
“sicken ”flay the verdictexon-
crating Rodney King’s assailants. He
was not bothered by the looting and

murder, except insofar as they indi-
cated an unmet need for “sympathy“
with the "inner-city youth” of LA. 7
and for huge transfers of wealth from
“the rich” to them.

PresidentBush has made clear his
eagemess to send American forces to
Somalia with orders to supervise the
distribution of food to the country’s
starving people. It doesn’t bother him
at all that Somalian warlords have
promised to send home in body bags
any foreign troops who arrive. As he
has repeatedly shown during his presir
dency. Bush places about as much
value in the lives of American soldiers
as he does in proper grammar.

The US. goveniment new con
surnes something like 40% of Ameri-
cans’ earnings, but it is still failing to
discharge its most basic obligation to
them. the protection of their lives and
property.lt squandets moneyand lives
in foreign adventures that serve for
eign interests. Any resident of a large
American city will tell you he's far
more concerned about the safety of his
family and property than about the
well-being of Somalians, or
Bangladeshis, or Kuwaitis. or any of
theotherpcoples Bush has tried to aid,

The president’s failings fomenl
anger and resentment feelings David
Duke can manipulate with impressive
skill. That‘s not to say that he can be
forgiven forsellingcopies of Thth'iler
We Loved And Why, or for spouting
tacistnonsenseontelevisiontalkshows.
I don‘t know how Mr. Wittsiruck can
have made such an inference.

If he takes exceptiontoinsubstanr
Lial articles, I expect that he will write
a letter critical of Papa Owusu, who as
far as I know has never cited a more
authoritative source titan Ebony maga-
zine. It seems rather ironic that, in the
faeeowausu’s“work," he singles out
for criticism a columnist who quotes
historians at length, In the past, politi-
cal opponenls of mine have offered
intelligent, interesting criticisms, but
for some reason no onehasdone so this
semester.
