Calhoun explains speaker selection

by Jo Calhoun
DiFECtDI‘ of Academic Advising

In the past, and including this
year, the Senior Week Committee
members were appointedby the Presi-
dent from a list of students recom-
mended by the Commencement Co-
ordinator. (The Commencement Co—
ordinator for over 20 years was Bill
Deminoff. I assumed his position
when he retired last May.) Students
on the list typically represent a div
verse group of students with demon-
strated leadership skills. For Com-
mencement '93, they are Jacob
Alexander, lay Dick, Yannis
Evrigenis, Jennifer Kyvig, Nthcnya
Mule, and India Weston. Next year
we plan to ask SGA to make appoint»
mentstotheseniorWeekCommittee,
just as they do for other strategic
committees.

The Senior Week Committee is
charged with planning the lOO Days
Party and the events of the weekend
preceding Commencement. In addi-
tion, they have the task of rccom-
mending to the faculty :1 Commencer
mentspeaker. Ultimately,the faculty
has the formal responsibility of see
lecting a Commencement speaker.

The college's goal in choosing a
Comtnencemcnt speaker is to idcn~
tify someone who has tnade signifir
cant contributions in his/her field,
who is an outstanding speaker, and
who we believe will present a chal-
lenge to the graduating class. In addi-
tion, the speaker is traditionally
granted an honorary doctorate from
Grinncll by vote ofthe entire faculty,
so must be found wonhy ofthat dis-
tinction by the faculty. Our primary
goal has never been to find a high
profile celebrity or to have Com-
menccmcnt speech excerpts in Time
Magazine. We want the focus of
Commencement to be on the gradur
ates. For those reasons, we budget a
very modest amount for our Coin-
mencement speaker, and seek indiv
vidualswhohavedistinguishedthem-

selves professionally and personally.

When the Senior Week commit-
tee met last spring to consider Com-
mencement speakers, the fust thing
they did was topoll the classof ‘93 via
computer for suggestions of Com-
mencement speakers Approximately
30 students responded to that poll.
Based on those responses, they oom-
piled alist often individuals who met
the above criteria, then polled the
class of ‘93 again last May for their
preferences from thatlist. The Com-
mittee gave Gerald Lalonde, Chair of
the Faculty and me latitude to contact
and negotiate with speakers from this
listoften during the summer months,

and to make an offer contingent on a ~

vote of the faculty in early fall,

The ten speakers named were
PJ. O‘Rourke, GeirLundestad, Ngugi
WaThiong'o, Michael Walzer,
Patricia Schroeder, Paul Wllstone,
Nikki Giovanni, Harry Edwards,
Cokie Roberts, and Ursula LeGuin.
A total of 147 class of '93 members
responded to the poll. During the
summer I methodically contacted all
but one of these speakers or their
agents, in the order of poll prefer-
ence. (The person I could not reach
was tcnth on the list.) In two cases,
speaker fees ran as high as $5,000.
In three cases, speakers were notavailr
able on May 24. lconsultod with Mr.
Lalonde as I proceeded. We were

Harry Edwards, ’93
Commencement Speaker.

very pleased to be able to come to an
agreement with Harry Edwards by
the end of the summer.

Mr. Edwards meets all of the
criteria we used to identify a speaker.
He is a respected authority in his
field, he is a compelling speaker, and
his work is on the "cutting edge" of
American culture. We believe that
the graduating class will not be dis-
appointed with his selection.
