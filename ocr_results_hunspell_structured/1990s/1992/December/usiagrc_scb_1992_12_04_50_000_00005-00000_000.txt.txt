The world is shrinking; but don't worry, it won't implode

by Tom Zlablnger

In 1945, when Miles Davis lcithome
lo go learn how to play and find Charlie
Parker. he had lo go all lhe way lo New
York. In lhe 60:. when Janis Joplin
dropped oul or college lo sing in a band
and start her career, she had to travel to
San anClsco. Today, 1992, if Tom
Zlahinger Wants to gel his music heard by
managers andproducers alloverlhecoun
try, he doesn‘t even have to leave his
room. What happened?

There is a service based in Califor-
nia called TAXI. Ifyou have a computer
and a modem. you can give Lhem a call
and for aree they will hookyou up wuhall
the people you ever needed or wanted to
know in the music business, While l‘rn
out playing lhe blues in Grumell. lowa
someone else can be shopping my demo
tape in Ins Angeles, New York, Minne
apolis, Chicago. or who knows where
else.

This is justonc example of how the
microchip is eonlinually changing the way
we live, think and act. [know and under-

Stumbleweed
returns to

Grinnell

by Tom Zlablnger‘

Anyone who remembers the
Grinnell College band Shrinkydink
probablyrhinksrhatithasendedupin
Lhe“thrc-arc-they-now? Filo." Ace
tually, Shrinkydink’s members relo»
calcdthissummertoSt.Paul,Minne-
sold and are performing as
Stumblcweed.

Stumblcwccd consists of Grin-
nellalumni ChrisJardinc ’91 (drums)
and Andy Scagrcn ’92 (bass) and
former Grinnell students Jeremy
Hawkinson ’93 (vocals, guitar),
Charles Maynes ’94 (guitar), and

ware never ceases to amaze me. lcartnot
unaginc thal Robert Noyce, a onnnell
alumnus, completely lcnew what he was
gelling the world into when he invented
the microchip. Now inronnation spins
around lhis world at the speed of sound
likeelecuons continuously circling eround
an alonr‘s nucleus.

But where will this lead? Won‘t we
end up hung on more lhan we can chew
and surfocatc ourselves? Won't we have
more information and data than we can
actually deal with?

The argument that this advanlage
creates more disadvantages just does nol
hold. We cannow seeso much more Lhan
we could before. It is as if the people of
the world were Galileo and in one instant
saw the real order or lhcunivcrsc. chan
new cutout the lies and needless informa-
tion. We can out to the chase and have
power over all of our domain.

There is an argumenllhough lhalnol
everyone can gain access to this informa
tion. Since nol everyone can aiiord a
computer, faxmachine orcarphone. some
people will be excluded from lhe phcr
nomena that is rocking om world.

This is not true, Presently n0| ch
eryone can afford all this new hardware
thalls the key to dreinfonnalion smorgasr
hord. But in this computer crazcd world
prices are plumrneung.

In 1983. my farnlly gol their first
computer, an Apple lie, with 128K and
two ﬂoppy drives. I was loo young to

remember, or care, how much the ma
chine cost but it must have been near
$3.000. Now, in 1992. for less than half
lhalmuch. you can gal amaehine. rBM or
Macintosh. with 3,000K. a 40.000K
HARD drive, and a ﬂoppy dnve. This is
30 limes lhe power for half the price and
this all happened wuhin NINE years.

What is happening? It prices keep
spurring in half every 10 years or so.
today's average computer will cosl under
$100 by the year 2030. ladmill‘m nolau
economist, but within my lifetime. I am
sure this power will be affordable by
EVERYONE.

Also.compulersdonotsccanycolor,
race. sex, or sexual preference. This is
pcriecll People will have this non-dis-
criminalory power al their tmgerups by
Lhc time our grandchildren are born. This
will overthrow the world.

Now the devtl‘s advocate asks. "But
who is going to control this power?
SOMEONE is going is control it." Well,
it we all slay smarl and keep ourselves
educated, wcwill all be in controlr And if
we are all ln control, no SINGLE person
has more control than another. Thus a
stale orlolai anarchy is achieved because
no one has power over anyone else.

Yes, this IS a dream now, BUT. this
dream will come truc. With the rate
things are going. we will all be able to
"reach out and touch someone" And the
lime lo gel mvolved is nowl Qucslion
people's sources. Look up information.

Janis and Miles lived irl an older,

synthesizers, a Macintosh computer,
a sound board, and a highend audio

cutting edge. Students get theoppor-
tunity to have hands-on experience
