The Brand New Heavies

Raw funk

and jazzy

soul at Grinnell

The Brand New Heavies are fola
lowing a backlash trend toward real
musiciansand livebands. First emerg-
ingintiie 1980’s in England,theBrand
New Heavies joined the movement
which "paid tribute to raw funk and
jazzy soul." They have gone back to
the basics with live instruments and
live vocals, and their selfrtitled Deli-
cious Vinyl release attempts to cap
ture the energy of their stage presen-
tation. Their honi players, according
toNew YorkNewsdtzy, break outin a
sweat from "blowing iheirlungs out "

The lineup includes bassist An—
drew Levy, guitarist Simon
Bartholomew,percussionist/guilarist
Lascelles Gordon, drummer/
keyboardist Jan Kincaid, and sax
player Jim Wellman, N'Dea Daven-
port, who contributed background
vocals on platinum albums for Ma
donna and Tone Doc, fronts the band
with her sultry vocal delivery.

Bartholomew, their guitarist, ex7
plained, "Funk was a very active part
of our social lives; we all were
strongly inﬂuenced by it." Specifi-
cally, they were inﬂuenced by James
Brown, Earth, Wind and Fire, and
Jimi Hendrix. to name a few.

The Brand New Heavies have
proved themselves a "better than av-
erage black and white band rich in
both the technique and feel of 19705
funk," according to New York
Newrday. They will be playing at
Grinnell on Saturday, May 9.

Also coming to Grinncll, on Fri-
day. May 8, is Firehosc, bringing
with them their brand of "scientist"
rock 'n roll. "With a multifaceted
attack thatfar transcendsthe standard
moshrmakcrs,” raved the Los
AngelesTt’mer, “Firehose has been
among the best in the business since
rising from the ashes of Minutemen
in 1985."

The Mission

A serene view of the lgua Au Falls in the heart of a South American jungle is interrupted by a white
missionary, tethered to a cross, helplessly plunging from the watcrfall's edge to his death. This beginning of
The Mission is an abrupt introduction into a world of striking wonder and harsh realities. The film is based
on the Jesuitmissionary conﬂict in Paraguay of 1753, and to fully appreciate The Mission it is necessary to
know its historical background.

The Jesuit missions were in a territory that had changed hands from the Spanish, who officially opposed
enslavcmcnt of the indigenous peoples, to Portugal, which saw these missions as a hindrance to economic
exploitation of the Guarani and their land. The Catholic Church, to ensure peaceful geopolitics, aquicsccd
after the Portuguese government threatened to expel all Jcsuit monks in their territories.

The Mission pomays the internal and external conﬁictofa Jesuit priestUeremy Irons). aJcsuit novice and
former slave trader(Robert DeNiro), and a papal emissary as each battles with issues of faith, obedience.
power, andjusttcc. Although it won best film at the 1986 Cannes festival, The Mission received poor reviews
and returns in the U.S., perhaps due to its sparse use of “action" and Concrete solutions. The cinematography
is masterful, and Ennio Moricorrc’s score skillfully combines baroque and native music. Regretfully, the film
does concentrate on the white Europeans, thus pomaying the Guarani as pawns both historically and
dramatically. The Mission will be shown May 8 and 10 at 9:00 pm. in Nortlt Lounge.

bw friend, the head writer on the show, and Elisabeth Shuc is Celeste’s niece, an aspiring actress whose
appearance on the show leads to some startling(and funny) plot revelations. Especially funny is Kevin Kline
