Aview from Ferguson

By India Weston

President Pamela Ferguson says she
will be glad when the school year is
over— to sum up observations which
will prepare her for the future. of
course! She says her biggest chal-
lenge has been “trying to learn the
rhythms of Grinnell."

Ferguson believes she is one of
few presidents who, after six months,
“is more impressed by the strength of

the school." Since presidents are not
given all of the information about a

school before they take the job, they
often arrive to find some important
aspect which needs to be tackled,
Yet. “we have things here I didn’t
know we had,” stated Ferguson, cit»
ing assets such as Grinnell’s various
support systems and interesting stur
dent body, the latter of which is rare.

Grinnell will “need to become as
multicultural as possible” in order to
survive, Ferguson stated.
Demography calls for a multicultural
community, “with emphasis on both

LONG

words,” Matching the rising need for

inancial assistance andattracting fac-
ulry are ongoing aspects which will
be advantages for Grinnell in com»
parison with other colleges,

The Multicultural Task Force. the
president‘s committee designed to
“[help] the campus develop the stra»
tegic plan” to keep Grinnell ahead, is
made up of students. faculty, and ad-
ministration. Ferguson feels that it is
a very good sign that so many people
are on the committee, which has de»
veloped a questionnaire from which
information will be gathered for feed»
back.

Though her job “takes a lot of
energy,” Ferguson said. “I think
Grinnell is just a wonderful place."
She was able to teach last fall, and is
still “interested in academic issues."
In a large institution, she stated. her
job would stray far from academics.
Because Grinnell is a school which is
focused and contains “academically
trained students,” she feels her job is
much more exciting.

Campbell stresses exploration;

“Mostoflife on earth.. has yet to

talk, he spoke of his passion for biol-

he was indeed enthralled in his dis-

Campbell's talk was a pitch for
environmentalism. He spoke of his
research in the Amazon and Antarc-

Men Stopping
Rape striving to
change patriarchy

By Gareth Fisher

Early last semester. the campus
groupMenStoppingRapewasformed
as a political action group comple—
menting the discussion group Men’s
Alliance for Change. MSR was in
spirod by a national organization of
the same name. which has taken an
aetiverolein tryingtocllangepzltrlar
chy over the last ten years. The
Grinnell group is coordinated by first»
year student Matthew Miller, senior
Howard Greenwich. and senior
Michael Landsberg.

The word "rape" in the group‘s
titlerefcrsto more than justaphysical
action. Says Greenwich: “Rape is
more than a strange man jumping out
of a dark alley. It is an attitude of
dominance which is directed towards
women and even men. It is not about
extreme behavior but everyday attir
tudes most then hold about women.”
The group believes that patriarchy
has its own set of values called rape
ethics. The act ofrape is the physical
manifestation of these values. Adds
Greenwich: “Pomogaphy, harass»

ment, date rape, and the lack of dia-
logue between men and women in
sexual relationships are only the tip
of the iceberg”,

Lastscmester, the group organized
two actions: an open discussion of
the men who attended the Women
Take Back the Night rally, and 2|
viewing and discussion ofrapeethics
demonstrated in both hard core pore
nography and PG—13 and R»rated
ﬁlms. This semester the group plans
an allcampns program. and hopes to
havean outreach program in the com-
munity high school.

The planning meetings and dis-
cussions in the groupare open only to
men. Greenwich maintains research
by the national group has shown that
men will be most honest talking to
men about the issues of patriarchy.
He adds. “The primary change of the
structure of patriarchy has come from
feminism. but to change it. men must
be involved."

The group does not as of yet have
a regular meeting time or place. If
you are interested in joining, tell

The forest came to life for‘
Campbell on his firstjoumey to the ,
tropical rainforcst in 1980. In his
talk. he speculated on the fates of ‘
the trees he had catagorized while .
there. Although he has returned to
the forest twice since then. he added, ‘
“Time is the key to understanding e
the tropical forest."

From his explorations. he has
noticed that the monality or new‘

and fallen rocks. He added, “No

Campbell pointed out that 43% ‘

Campbell also offered liquid oxyr .

Dance

group
reborn

By Heidi Bakken

TheGrinnell College Dance Movc- <
ment is reviving a long dormant stu— A
dent group and crating a new tradi—
tion of dance at Grinnell College. ‘
The goal of the group is to bring the ,
fineartofdancetothecampus through
workshops and performances '

Since the dance department at .
Grinnell is very small, the classes >
offered are very limited in style and
quantity. and the Theater department -
is often low on the list for receiving _
new faculty and facilites.

Last semester the Movement hired
a graduate student from the Univer» .
sity of Iowa to teach a ballet work-
If ‘
attendance indicates anything, there
was a lotof intcrestcxpressed. How-
ever. the cost was about six dollars

: per session per student, This semeS» ‘
. ter, a ballet workshop will again be ,

offered once a week, and funding will
be available to lessen or eliminate the
cost to the student. .
In addition, the Dance Movement
plans to put pressure on the Public ,

‘ Events Commitee in order to bring a r

professional or semi-professional ‘
dance company to the campus to give
performances and hold workshops.
The Dance Movement is also keeping .
informed as to the performances go-
ing on in Iowa City and the surround-
ing area andwill try to arrange trips to ~
see these performances. Above all, ,
any suggestions as to how we can
bring more danceto theGrinnell cam- '
pus would be appreciated.
