The king lives!

Elvis spotted on campus

By Amber Klinge

Have you ever wondered who is
the uniquely cool person who deco-
rates the first floor of Gates with
rare Elvis paraphernalia? I often
asked myself that question, espe»
cially after being happily diverted
fromthecold,boringnightbyanew
picture ofElvisdraping thewindow
of a single on Gates first.

When I say new. I mean new.
About once a week the display is
changed. Sometimes it is just a sil-
houette of“the King,"atothert.imes
it is a fully
c o l o r e d
glow»in-the-
dark colored
poster, or a
rug. When
ever I think
that I have
s e e n a l I
Grinnell has
to offer, that
I could hap-
pily be expe-
riencing all
that this
small place
has to offer
and more by
moving to
any other
place in the
world,Igoto
Gates first
and look at a
new picture
ofElvis.

Who is
this person
who helps
keep Elvis alive in the hearts of
many people? I ﬁnally got up the
nerve to go ﬁnd out. His name is
Jose Luis Corral. He is a ﬁrst year
student from Chicago. He has ﬁve
siblings, none of whom have any

Corral was five
years old
“There was this
great big fat man
in this white
jumpsuit,and1was
trying to figure out
who he was. I saw
the fans crying.
They would show
his red scarf and

was mesmerized
by this three hour

ing who this man
was. I guess it wasn’t until afterwards

Corral's interest in Elvis sprouted
overnight. For many years, he read
about Elvis when he could, Some-

He said no and then
asked me if he ever

After studying
Elvis for over 14

years, Corral knows i

a lot about Elvis, the
person and the per
sona. He definitely
does not idolize
Elvis. He is aware of
bolhhisstrengthsand

Corral respects ,
Elvis “because he 34
camefrom nowhere -

He was born in a one
room shack in Miss- issippi.. ,1 think
he luckedouL Withoulluck, he’d still
be driving a truck.”

Corral is still amazed by Elvts’s
fans’ reaction. "If Elvis was Still
around, his shaking act would be the
cleanest most wholesome act today.
And yet it warranted that
response...wow.”

Corral believes that Elvis was a
kind-hearted, genuinely good person.
Elvis was discovered byasmall record
companynot because Elvis was show-
ing off his beautiful voice, trying to
get a fastbreak. but because Elvis had
saved his money for a record that he
would make for his mother, for her
birthday.

“Elvis had a wonderful relation»
ship with his parents and he never
said no to an autograph.”

When I asked Jose if he thought
Elvis was alive or dead, Jose rer
sponded, “Elvis is deﬁnitely dead."
