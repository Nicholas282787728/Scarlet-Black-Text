Women's basketball team gears

up for season's final Weekend
Cagers host Coe tonight; travel to Carleton Sunday

By Alex Severens

“This team has a very fine mar»
gin of error," Coach Eskildsen com-
mented after watching the women‘s
basketball team sustainadifﬁcult and
frustrating loss to Illinois College on
Saturday. “If we areoff in one partof
our game, it is hard for any other area
of our game to make up the differ-
ence.”Shoot.ingwas theareain which
the Pioneers could not get on track in
last Saturday’s rematch of last
season's conference championship
game, and they fell 68-59.

Unfortunately, the “big game"
atmosphere which Illinois generated
didnotprovide theoomph the women
neededtohit their shots. They quickly
fell to a 6-0 deﬁcit, and had to fight to
keep up for the rest of the game. First
half shooting totals saw the Pioneers
ata dismal 28% from the field, com-
pared with 41% for the Lady Blues.
In the second half, shooting improved
considerably, and the women finished
the game shooting 37%.

“To beat Illinois College, we
needed to play a near perfect game
and they needed to struggle," said
Eskildsen after the game.

The game against Illinois Cole
lege was disappointing after an easy
game earlier in the week against
Teikyo Marycrest. Against
Marycrest, the Pioneers could do no
wrong, as they hit 57% from the ﬁeld
and 77% from the line in the 72-56
victory. Because of the wide margin
of victory, the Pioneers were able to
let everybody get in some playing
time.

Seniorlenny Wood led the Grinr
nell scoring attack against Marycrcst,
as she dumped in 25 points. Her
partner in the Grinnell front court,
Amy Fort, also had a hot hand, as she
chipped in 20 points. The crowd was
pleased to see Tirsit Brooks have one
of herbest days in aPioneer uniform,
asthe6‘3"juniorconnectedon allher
shots and added six points to the
Grinnell effort.

In order for Grinnell to earn a
birth in the Conference Tournament,
they must defeat Coe tonight. and
Illinois College must defeat
Monmouth College, Said Coach
Eskildsen of the team’s current con
ference standing, “We’ve put ourself
in this position. All we can ask for is
to be playing the last weekend of the
season in a game that has meaning.”
Tonight’s game definitely has mean-
ing, as the post season hopes of this
12-7 team rest on a victory.

Tonight at Darby will be a spe-
cial night because the College Dining
Service will be sewing pizza at the
game, starting at 5:00. But the game
willbe special for another reason too.
Seniors Shannon Hancock and Jenny
Wood will be displaying their talents
in front of their friends and peers for
the ﬁnal time in Grinnell uniforms.
These two outstanding basketball
players will be honored before the
game, and it is Coach Eskildsen’s
hope that the Grinnell community
can appreciate what these two have
done, and come out to give them the
honor they so rightly deserve.

Hancock and Wood have seen
the program at Grinnell turn around
from a 5717 record four years ago, to
a 20-4 record last year. They have

seen two division championships
and one conference championship,
and it is their hope that they will be
abletodo so again thisycar. Wood‘s
career has seen her shoot AIS/976
field goals and 221/292 free throws
for 1057 total points. Thai is the
third highest point total ever posted
by a Grinnell woman.

Hancock had a rough first two
seasons at Grinnell, with injuries
both years, but she fought back to
earn herselfa fair arnountofplaying
time lastseason, and this year she is
recognized as one of the sharpest
inside players in Division III. Her
57.5% shooting from the field puts
her not only near the top of Grinnell
record books, but she also currently
has the fourth best field goal per-
centage in Division III. Her num
bers in two years are 192/334 from
the ﬁeld and 85/135 from the char-
ity stripe. She also has been the
rebounding strength that Grinnell
hasneeded,havingpulleddown312
over the last four years

Coach Eskildsen can do nothing
butpraise this team‘s effort, “Good
things happen to good people, and
that’s why this team excels. I am
tremendously proud of this team
because they are trying to make
their effort a little uncommon. This
effort is unique. There is so much

caring between them, and the con-
stant is their commitment The kind
of integral relationship that this team
shows is what Division III athletics,
and college sports as a whole, is all
about. I know it is a lot to ask, but]
wish the college community could
appreciate all that goes into this team
as well as] do."

Eskildsen concluded, “This
team may notbeas talented as the last
two years’ teams, but they are my
favorite team, in part because they

those two Learns left behind. without
the same amount of talent. I really
respect that. They have worked hard
for about four and a half months, and
they deserve to win and they deserve
to have the shot to go to the confer
ence Tourney."
