Ford plans Whirlwind campaign

The other day I was putting upa
poster for Jewish Cultural Week in
mydormwhenoneofmyneighbors
catne up very slowlybchind meand
looked on. As I stepped away from
the sign, he let out 2t sigh of relief.
“Oh. I thought you were pulling up
astatementof intenttorun for Presi-
dettt of SGA." My reply was to
laugh at the mere thought of me
running for any elective office. I
explained that the last time I was
elected for anything was in seventh
grade, when I ran on tlte “Bring
back chocolate milk to the cafete-
ria“ platform.

Butthen l thoughtabout it. Why
not run? Ambition swelled up in-

nity to test the waters and see if the
pooplewere ready for me to run for the
Big One. You got it, to hell with SGA,

States of America.

I ﬁgure that ifJerry Brown can win
30 percent of the dozen or so votes that
were cast in Maine last weekend, then
Ihaveatleastadecentshotatbringing
a few Ford delegates to the conven-
tion. He calls himself an “outsider."
Ha! I can beat him at that game any
day. He was Governor of California
for several years. That sounds pretty
damn “inside" to me. The highes 1
office I ever held was student council
president during sixth grade. My ad-
ministration never ran a single budget
deﬁcit, in fact we had at Campbell
Soup label surplus.

When it comes to Washington l'm
anevenbiggeroutsider.I‘veonlybeen
there three times and two of those
were school trips. The other time was
for a wedding. While there I accepted
no PAC money and established no

toll-free phone numbers for you to
call up and contribute to my camr
paign. You want to give me money,
leave mea message on my answering
machine. If you‘re too cheap to pay
for the call then you probably weren t
going to vote for me anyhow.

Then there’s the issues.

THE ECONOMY: Granted, the
economy really stinks right now. I
really can’t tell you how I would fix
it. I thought about a middle class tax-
cut,butthen I realized that90 percent
ofyou consideryourselfmiddleclass
and a lot of you would be upset when
you found outtltat you don'tqualify.
A capital gains tax-cut that would
reward investment sounds interest-
ing, buthongas is tsinging that tsong
and I don’t tsee how I could posSibly
compete. After all, he‘s no Tsanta
Claus.

FOREIGN POLICY: Same old,
new world order. Giveme an orderof
third world proliferation, with a side
of Mid- East peaee talks, a ﬂedgling
democracy on the rocks and a Cuban
flambE for dessert.

EYES WIDE

OPEN

This blancoheteropatriarchy sucks

Ever feel like every thing you do
is really futile? Like nothing you do
ever matters? Like everyone is tak—
ing themselves too seriously, but
you? Everything seems so damn fu-
tile, especially around here. If you
sitintheforumlongenough youcan
get a pretty good dosage of relative
nothingness that always seems so
very tmponant. Folks kept getting
their buns in an uproar because the
Grill only has small mugs, so ifyou
want to buy a large hot beverage.
you have to come back. ‘Coursc if
students hadn't stolen all the mugs
in the first place mere‘d be some
large mugs. I didn’t order a raisin
bagel, I ordered a plain bagel.
Who’s tapping their pen? Who the
hell keeps making that tapping
noise? Would you stop drumming
on the table? Jeez. And look at all
these people who think they look
cool smoking cigarettes. Did hejust
start yesterday or what? He doesn’t
even inhale. And all these men.
Yuck.

Okay. We’d better leave the Fo-
rum. This is not a good place for
grumpy Dykes. Instead let's go to
Burling and get some work done.

all. I could continue dial argument in
the seventeenth stall about why “hoe
mosexuals should fry in a pit of hell."
But why?

Iknow. I’ll go toa StudentGovemr
tnentloint Board meeting. Hey, isn‘t
the chair supposed to reserve his opin-
ions? Oh, that wasn't an opinion, just
facts. Right. The treasurer says that
thisgroupreallydoesn'tmind theSZOO
cut made in their proposal, although
they‘re not here to say. Sure. Can you
really quit your two year position to
run for President? Wasn’t thatan origi-

nal idea, Hey, who are all these white
boys and why are they all senators? l
don‘tthink this isa good idea because
blah blah blah blah. I don’t think
anyone is listening to me anymore.
Can you blame them? Ifind faultwith
everything. Can you blame me? This
blaneoheteropatriarchy sucks.

Why don‘t I read some good un-
derground newspapers? Here‘s one
with groovy comics, but the articles
are boring. Besides which, it’s writ-
ten by all men. Then there’s one that
gives out free gum. Cool. I like Utis
one better, even though they have no
nifty comics and is also written by a

It’s easy to admire the men and
women ofthe civil rights movement,
,who fought tirelessly for oppressed
minorities However the people who
irepresent minorities today (or claim
to) deserve only imprecation. They
smear innocent people with verbal
excrement, and they find Hitters lurk-
ing where none exist.

I thank Jordan Magill for provid-
ing a casein point. In a letter in this
paper, Magillcharges me with‘wazt
ism.“ His evidence is a column that
attacks liberal immigration policies
and says that Stalin and Hitler were
evil men who had a rare courage. No
one could really think that this repre-
sents “Naziism.” Rather, Magill imr
putes it because he can‘t think up a
logical response.

For all theirhideous crimes, Hider
and Stalin were indeed brave. There
were several examples of courage in
Hitler’s life; I will give one. Shortly
after the Great War. Hitler marched
in the frontrow of the Nazil’uuchist
parade,knowingthatitwouldbefired
on (when it was fired on, by govemr
merit forces, the man marching ber
side Hitler was killed). Stalin was a
revolutionary socialist in a country,
Cmrist Russia, where radical leftists
were often hanged—Lenin’s older
brother Alexander, for example. In a
certain sense, he was like the liberal
heroes mentioned above, Although
he and Hitler and were monsters, they
had the courage to put principle over
self-interest.

Though the infamous question
about Mexican immigrants did not
originate with me, I Will defend it
anyway. Much of the southwestem
U.S. originally belonged to Mexico:
only through a series of bloody ag-
gressive wars in the former halfofthe
18005 did We acquire it. Now, this is
defensible, but many Mexicans refer
to the land as “the Occupied Ten-i-
tory," and, as reported in credible
sources (Chronicles, for instance).
some ofthem are talking about immi-
grating there and getting the land back
by vote. Some people (myself not

 

COMMON SENSE
"The real racists"

included) are asking whether they
will in fact manage to do this.
America has aracial character and
a cultural character. The racial char-
acter can change: that in itself is fine.
But because many immigrants have
no intention ofbecoming assimilated
Americans, preferring their culture to
ours (witness Mexican immigrants
who stick to Spanish), the change of
the racial character entails cultural
changes, whose desirability is debat-

able.

Magill presumes to speak for
“American Jews," but other Jewish
students whom I spoke to found the
letter absurd. If Magill seeks to pro
tect his fellow Jews, ﬁne, but they
face bigger dangers than insensitive
college students. Leonard Jeffries,
chairman of the black studies depan~
ment at the City University of New
York, has allegedaconspiracy by the
mafia and Hollywood Jews to con-
siructa“system of destruction of black
people,” and has derided Diane
Ravitch as a “Texas Jew.” The “civil
rights activist“ Stokely Carmichael—
one of whose speechwriters spoke
here at Grinnell this week—has said
in a speech (written by whom, I wonA
der?) that “we must take a lesson
from Hitler."

Most ominously. Lyndon
Larouche, whose virulent anti-
semitism is welllmown,willbeafree
man in a few months, having shareda
cell with the honorablelim Baker in
a prison in Rochester, Minnesota (poor
Larouchel).

There are powerful anti—Semitic
demons out there, and if you cry
”Hitler!" every timesome writersays
something nasty, no one will listen to
you when a real Hitler comes along.

Magill and his friends were so
troubled by the vision of “shouting
mobs" which my column evoked in
