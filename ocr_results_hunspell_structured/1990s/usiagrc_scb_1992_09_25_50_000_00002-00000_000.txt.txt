became apparent that the case was
being tried less on fairness or prin~
ciples than on the personal agenda of
the Reagan appointed judges who
heard the case. The interplay between
the historians who were called in as
expert witnesses and the lawyers who
tried the case was a difficult one. The
lawyers tried to reduce the evidence
and the theories down to their sim-
plest forms while thescholars tried to
express the subtleties and complica~

worked jobs similar to those women
who worked for Sears. Lane‘s stu
dents found, when they interviewed
the women. that they would always
take the higher paying job, to be
better mothers. To these women,
being a better mother means being
able to give your child opportunities,
such as education, which require
money. These findings spread new
light on the courtroom argument and
remind everyone to be careful of
making broad statemean about what
women want and what motivates
them.

Lane started out her activist ca-
reer as a civil rights activist in the
‘60‘s.Itwasn’tuntilshestartedteachn
ing, in the early ‘70’s, that she got
interested in Women’s history and
issues. Her latest scheme is to start a
radio show called, “Sister Talk”
which, she hopes will eventually air
on National Public Radio. She was
inspiredtothisprojectwhensheheard

much has changed in the past thirty
years, so that although things may be
frustrating and revolting now she
encouraged faith in women's ability
to truly affect their world.

Lane listed several recent politi
cal changes in Women’s issues, in-
cluding the E.R.A. bill now up in
Iowa and a recent case in Louisiana
in which abortion restrictions were
ruled unconstitutional. And she ex-
pressed hope that Lhese events would
be effective in involving people in
dialogue, an important step to change.

Hewlett Project:
Women in Russia

 

by Kendra Ford

"Womencandoeverything, Men
can do the rest” this is how the REES
talk by members of the Russian de-
partment on Tuesday afternoon.
Helen Scott, associate professor of
Russian and associate dean of the
college and senior Russian major,
Nicka Apell spoke about their expe—
riences this summer on a Hewlett
Project: Women in Russia. Scott
posed the question, have there been
any changes for women after 1985
and pcrestroika? To find outwhathas
happened in women's lives since the
changes in the state in Russia Scott
and five students went to Russia to
study lifeatthe grassroots'l'heCom-
mittee on Women in St. Petersburg
was very helpful in finding intem-
ships for thestudents in various areas
of interest to women, including an
orphanage,andschoolwithprograms
for the handicapped, and a church
run hospital, These institutions are of
interest to women because they are
family concems and in Russia the
role of mother is quite important, as
both Apell and Scottpoinied out sev-
eral times.

Outside of thme internships the
students met with Women's groups
once or twice a week. Some of these
groups are traditional state affiliated
Women’s groups but a few of them
are, what we would consider to he,
feminist groups. Apell pointed out

that the “feminist” groups have only
existed for about a year so they are
really only just beginning. She also
madeitvery clear that the“feminist”
is not an often used nor well liked
term in Russia. It is associated with
all the others ~isms which have not
created the best results for Russia. It
also viewed as a label for female
separatists. So, feminist is not a fan
voredterminRussia.Apelldescribed
her visits with six of the Women‘s
groups with whom she met.

Several of the groups express a
feeling that women are naturally
meant to be mothers, to be nurturing
and he at home caring for the house
hold. Apell said she often heard
women express the sentiment that
women‘s real place was in the home.
Two of the groups are pressing for
the government to pay salaries to
women who stay home to care for the
children and household. Many
women in Russia work, due to eco-
nomic necessity, to stay home, they
would need to receive a salary. A
couple of the other groups were ofr
fen'ng classes to women and means
to form alliances Willi other women.
Such organizations are quite new in
Russia and are still organizing them-
selves. Apcll noted that one of the
mostremarkableorganizationswhich
has started up is a RapeCrisis Center
which has been functioning for only
somceightmonths.lt haSZ4 hourhot
line and medical and psychological
consulting services It is partially
funded by donations and partially by
the state. This is quite and unusual
phenomenon in Russia.

Scottsaid,wiih somedisappoint—
merit, thatitdid appear to her that the
government had made any changes
which had any posnive effect for
women. She said, women ”still”
hear an unequal share of the troubles
and now that the economic situation
is worsening women bear more
trouble, According to Apell 75% of
the newly unemployed in St. Peters—
burg are women. Scott concluded her
statements by saying that no one can
solve women‘s problem's but
