lost to two nationally ranked teams.
tlle Pioneers will gear up for touma~

clinched the Midwest Conference
South Division‘s top spot. and will
defend its league title this weekend

ous. they will play the winner of the
St, Norbert-Monmouth game Sun-
day at 1:00 pm.

Last week, the Pioneers took on
a talented Colorado College squad,

Amid dubious seedings, women’s
tennis takes sixth at MWC meet

By DAVE KIDDOO
Sporls Editor

LTHOUGH the Grinnell
women’s tennis team fin
islied sixth at the Midwest

Conference tennis tournament two
weeks ago, coach Dee Fairchild was
pleased with the effort of herplayers.
“We played well, but we gota terrible
draw,” commented Fairchild,

The Pioneers, who scored 32
points, ﬁnished a mere four points
behind ﬁth’plaCE St Norbert. That
difference could have been made up
with two more wins from the cham-
pionship bracket. Said Fairchild, "If
we would have gotten our number
one doubles learn seeded, we would

haveprobablygottenabyeinthe first
round. That would have made ti
second-round victory worth six
points. However. two teams that we
beat this year got seeded and we
didn't."

Despite the perceived inequities
in the seeding process, the team per-
formed well in Madison, Danielle
Koehnmadeitlothesemiftnalsinthe
number one singles bracket. losing to
the eventual champion. “Danielle
played her usual good tennis. but she
had a really tough draw," said
Fairchild.

Nicola McClung also made the
semiﬁnals at number four singles.
Erika Schuh won the consolation
bracket at number three singles, as

did the number one doubles team of
Koehn and Nicole Nemeth,

Fairchild also praised theefforts
of first—years Kim Knous and Jeanne
Mackenzie in the number three
doubles SloL “If they play together
for three more years, they’re going to
be a great team when they're se-
niors," said Fairchild,

Beloit won the tournament with
a total of 93 points. Ripon and Coe
ﬁnished in a tie for second at 60
points each, and Cornell was fourth
with45 points. “Goinginto tile meet,
I thought that we’d probably ﬁnish
sixth. Seeding is not an easy busi-
ness. and the luck of the draw can
have a big effect on the outcome of
the meet."

LLOWING twoimpressive
FMidwestConference wins on i
the road against Knox and
Coe, the Grinnell College football‘
team hoped to move into first place
last Saturday against Cornell. Thel
Rams, however. had the same plan
and defeated the Pioneers on
Rosenbioom Field, 24-0. The loss
drops the Pioneers to 4-3 on the
season. “They made the adjust-
ments necessary to win the ball
game," remarked Coach Greg
Wallace. “They made the best of
their opportunities and we didn’t.”

The Pioneers started off poorly
as sophomore Kevin Humiston was
sacked for a safety on a first-quarter
punt attempt The Grinnell defense}
then stood firm through much ofthel
ﬁrst half and frustrated Comell’s
explosive option attack. Cornell
quarterback Pele Cnvanaugh’s 387
yard touchdownpassgave Comella
970 edge at the half.

TheGrinnell offensewas unable
to move the ball consistently in thei
against the Rams’ aggressive, blier
ing defense. Key injuries to fresh»

Sophomore Kafcle Hodari reeled in
four passes for 36 yards while fresh-
man Jim Hart was the leading msher
with 35 yards on six carries.

This Saturday the Pioneers face
the Monmouth Fighting Scots.
Monmouth features Strong offen-
sivc skill players and a tough de~
fense that has riddled some of the
conference’stop attacks. “Monmouth
is a physical team," commented
Coach Wallace. ”They play an at-
tacking defense and have a great
backﬁeld.” The Pioneers can clinch
their ﬁrstwinning season since 1970
with a victory Game time at
Rosenbloom Field is 1:30 pm.
