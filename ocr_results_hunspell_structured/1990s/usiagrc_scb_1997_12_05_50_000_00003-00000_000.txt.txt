The Directing Class
One ActPlays will be pre»
sented Thursday, Decem-
ber 4, through Saturday,
December 7. at the
Flanagan Arena Theatre.
Members of the class
chose plays and submitted
proposals to the instrucr
tors of the class, Sandy
Moffert and I an
Czechowski, earlier this
semester, and then held
auditions and chose their
crews. The performances
are the culmination ofthe
Directing Class,

“The class is an oppor»
tunity for students to go

. through the experience of
directing," Theo Bolt ‘99
said. “It’s graded, but it’s
not an assignment.

“This semester has
been unique," Bott said.
“There are limited resources because

of the three more serious plays.
”The play has been a 10! of hard
work," he said, “It’s been stressful

for everyone. There are l4 people

Bott continued. “It sounds pi'etenr
llOLIS but you want it to be there than

Just entertainment

is directing one oflhc
fivc comedies. “It’s a
borderline absurdisl
play," he said. “There
is not n lot of stagc
direction. lthns been
a gradual process to
find what I want to do
and where 1 want to
go. So it's been basi-
cally trial and error,
and keeping what
works."

Schnell sees ben»
efits in directing one
act plays, “In my
play, I did not use any
budget," he said, “A
benefit that I see is
practicality, You can
do something that is
less fully developed.
Humor is a lot easier
to pull offin a one act
than in a longer play."

lineup full of love

BY LAUREN WOLFE
Staff Writer

TheYoung Gifted and Black Gos—
pel Choir will be performing its an-
nual fall concert at 7:00 pm on Sun-
day. Dec. 7 in Herrick Chapel. The
theme of this show will be “Cel—
ebrate," and will include the choir‘s
entire repertoire, with songs such as
“I Love You Lord," ”Love," and “I

‘ Will Lift Up My Hands To You,"
; Rukyia Johnson, Lilian Benjamin,
j Carrie Stengel, and Danilo Juvane
1 will be the featured soloists.
This will be a more formal per»
‘ formance than the others YGB has
put on so far this year. However, bcr
ing a gospel choir, formality is a rain
rive term for the group. “We encour-
‘age audience participation in the
' form of shouting, clapping, raising

hands, and swaying from side to
side," said Moses Mason. “Gospel
music is part of the black Christian
tradition. and it’s best sung with an
audience whats highly spiritual. an
audience who participates."

YGB is composed of 15 members
and is directed by Julie Bell, With
Siclinda Caniy—Elliott as advisor.
“This group is a small group,” said
Mason, “yet it’s a very spiritual
group. vciy energetic, very
hardworking. willing to make a lot
of sacrifices."

“We're a closerknit group," Ma-
son contrnued. “We're probably
closer this year than we have been in
my past Iwo years at Grinnell due to
our smallness Our director rcnily
pushes our voices.“

“Our hope this Sunday is to lift

our voices in praise of God. We love
the Lord," Mason said. “That's cenr
tral to our songs, that‘s central to our
beliefs, that's central to the choir."

YGB performed earlier this year
at the Music Department's Parent
Weekend Showcase and at St. John’s
Lutheran Church in town. They also
sing regularly zit the Black Church
in Grinnell worship services at
Herrick Chapel.

The choir looks forward to its up-
coming spring tour which will take
them through Indianapolis, Colum-
bus and Cleveland in Ohio, Washing-
ton DC, and Chicago during the first
week ofspring break. They also will
be singing at a Martin Luther King.
Jr, celebration in Des Moincs on Jan.
18.

YGB will be welcoming Samuel
Williams as their new director this
spring.

 

iWindy City Chamber
Choir pays a visit

The Chicago String Quartet will
1 appear in concert tonight at 8 pm, at
. Herrick Chapel. Their visit is pri-
. ‘nzirily the fruit of Grinnell Cham-
)er Music Director and private in-
. ;trumenr instructor Nancy Gaub's
‘ 'abor, who thinks those who attend
will find the concert a rewarding ex-
‘ >erience.
“I expect a riveting performance,“
:aid Gaub. “Chamber music is some-
hing that people can identity with
‘nore then any other form of classi-
221 music.
Chamber music, which does not
‘ nccrporaie a director, places much

more emphasis on the individual
musicians,

“In chamber music, each
individual‘s playing is part of the
group," said Gaub. "Muslcrans have
zi lot ofindtvidualizcd freedom. Like
rock musicians today, there is lot of
independence for cnch musician."

This is the second time in as many
years a noted string qiiariet has come
[0 Grinnell. Last year witnessed the
coming of tire Russian Leontyuych
Quartet to Grinnell, an cvenl that ii-io-
tivaied Gnub to consider bringing
another quartet to campus,

“I found my students in chamber
muSic enjoyed and lcarncd so much
from it," said Guub. “I felt [the pos—
sibility oibringing another quartet to

Grinnell] with warm looking Into."

The quartet will be performing
Haydn's String Quartet in E Flat
Major. Op. 33. No. 2, also known as
The Joke; Qunnct No. 2, 0p. 17 by
Bartok and String Quartet Op. 44,
No. 2 by Mendelssohn.

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT
Finally, the Messiah arrives

BY RYAN OLSEN
Staff Writer

The Grinnell Community Choir
began learning the material in early
September, and has rehearsed it
nearly every Monday night sincc.
They were jotned by lhc Grinnell
Community Orchestra later in the
fall. and eventually the Grinnell
Singers after the end of fall break.
These three musical groups, totaling
approximately 200 people, have
spent a great deal of time working
on the production of Handel's Mer-
sia/l. to take place this Sunday, Dc-
ccmbcr 7, in Darby Gymnasium at 3
pm.

“Doing a piece such as this really
helps to build a greater sense ofcomr
munity," stared professor of music
John Rommereim, one of the two
drrcctors oflhe production. “This is
one time in which monibcis of the
local community can get together."

Rommercim was speaking of the
mixed membership of the separate
groups taking part in the production.
specifically the Grinnell Community
Chorr. Including Grinnell students as
well as professors, the roughly llOr
member Choir also consists of
people from the town oI'Grinncll, as
well as neighboring communities; 7-
8 of the choir members are from
Newton

“Students can be sitting next to
their professors. as they both try to
hit notes and stay in tune,”
Rommcrcim mentioned. “it provides
a nice break from our usual mode of
operation"

The college typically performs

Me’ddlilll every 45 ycnis or so. "This
production is always a big boost for
the choral program," Rommereim
also commented. "It is a' familiar
piccc, bitt it provides a good shot
lenge. It is ti lot of music to get
through."

As previously mentioned, the
Choir has been working on the mug
tcrinl sincu September “They know
l| quite well." Rommercim added.

Having planned to perionn Mes-
.tiuii since early in the spring of this
year, those involved have been work-
ing on thc production for a signiﬁ-
cant amount of time. But rchearsmg
it has “been a lot of fun,"
Romlnereim said. In addition to at-
tracting peoplc from local commu-
nities, the production has attracted
several distinguished soloists, Mel-
issa Mnldc from Luther College in
northwest Iowa, Jeffrey Snider of
Buffalo, NY, Elizabeth Calico of
Philadelphia, and Peter Else froin
Newton will perform in the produce
lion.

During the rehearsal period, the
group faced numerous logistical
problems, as Rommerelmexplained.
“We were too big to ill in Herrick
(chapel). and couldn’t practice in
Dnrby, because of basketball." The
group, with some help from Facile
ties Management. was able to prac-
tice in Harris Center.

. After months of work, the time for
the performance has arrived. In many
productions chessinit, groups per-
form excerpts from lhe entire piece.
In this production. “we have chosen
to perform the first two portions in
their entirety,” stated Rommercim in

3

an excerpt from a passage within the
program sheet entitled “Conductor’s
Impressions." In this way, he hopes
to give the audience a perception of
“Handel's pacing" throughout his
work. The sections were written to
flow together, and by performing
them. “we see how the narrative is
passed seamlessly from the soloists
to the chorus and back," Rommereim
added.

As Rommcreim also wrote, “there
are many things to treasure in Merv
siah: the brilliant vocal display by the
soloists and the chorus. the grandeur
of the orchestra, the drama. the spiri-
tual insight..."

“We have a really strong group
this year, especially the tenor sec-
tion," he stated. “The different
sounds balance themselves outqulte
well."

Additionally. this production is
“closer to Handel‘s original orches-
tration of his work." as Rommereim
explained. “This orchestra consists
mainly of strings.“

The performance should last ap»
proximately one and a half hours.
including a briefintennission.

After this performance. the sing-
ers will have a break, and look ahead
to a performance with the Baroque
Orchestra of Iowa. in Des Moines
and Grinnell on January 24 and 25.
Then over spring break. they have a
trip to Colorado, and then down to
Santa Fe. But this weekend’s perfor-
mance should prove to be a special
one. “We hope to see a good turnout
this Sunday” Rommeriem con»
cluded,

GG: Lee had been Whining a lot

CT: [did it because I'm a masr
ochisi.

and I have goltcn along and been in
the band together.

GG: lstill hate Tom‘s guts, it’s

with groupies during your career?

the stage and enthusiastic screaming
of phrases such as, “I want to have
your babiesl"]

S & B: Do you ever ﬁnd it hard

band, and all the peripheral hired
hands can come and go

mester. It's a shame there aren‘t
more campus bands around.

got to play New Student Days.

be sent to Lee Zappas through cam-
pus mail, t..
