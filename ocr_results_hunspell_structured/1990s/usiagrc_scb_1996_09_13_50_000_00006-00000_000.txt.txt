It is pretty easy for the objective observer
to spot a federal program. There are sev-
eral common characteristics:

1) Most attempt to solve problems better
handled by the private sector or state gov—
emments.

2) Most are not called for by the Constitu~
tion. were never envisioned by the Pound
ing Fathers (or even their 18th Century anar
logs). and are extant more
for the purpose of empow-
ering government than citi»
Zens.

3) Most are meant to effect
some goal that only, a
skewed mind would think is
the government’s job to
guard, and ﬁnally

4) Most have the logistic
virtue of Walter Mondale's
(or, for you more seasoned
individuals, Barry
Goldwater’s) presidential
campaign.

Recently, Congress, in
keeping with its goal of de~
volving power from Wash-
ington to the citizenry'
caused a phasing out of the
federal farm program, an
abomination matching all
four of the above criteria.

For those of you benighted on this aspect.
let me give a short explanation of what the
farm program did. It told farmers how
much they could plant and what type of
crops they could harvest, and in return the
government would pay the farmer the dif—
ference between a certain target price and
the price he/she was actually paid. S0, for
example, let’s say widgets sell in the mar-
ket for two dollars, but Washington thinks
that farmers should get four dollars for
them. Then the farther would sell his wid-
get for two dollars, and the government
would just send him two dollars to make

up the difference.

Another great part to this program, along
with the obliteration of market forces and
subsequent increase in price of food, is the
so-called 0-92 Rule. This is a wonderful
plan whereby the government pays a farmer
92 percent of what he would have received
for his crop if he does not raise it at all.
Yes, this is where the government pays the
farmer not to do anything.
Washington has paid
farmers to keep 61 M11,
LION acres unfarmed, a
region the size of Indiana
and Ohio combined. Ex-
cept, it isn’t the govern-
ment paying really; it is
the millions ofAmericans
who don't leech off the
government in this man-
ner, .

As in almost all federal
programs, the farm pro-
gram is rife with its abus-
ers. Of the 2.2 million
farmers in America, only
half run full time farms
(the restjust run part-time
and let the government
make it a very proﬁtable
business), and less than
one-fourth ruri ongoing commercial farms.
One doesn‘t have to run a full-time com-
mercial farm to get government money, so
most of them don't.

The estimated savings brought about by
phasing out the farm program is about 30
billion a year, which curbs anywhere from
15 percent to 25 percent of the annual def-1e
cit by itself. Along with this boon, we get
lower food prices (estimated 12 percent
savings by the Department of Agriculture).
and the farmers get a little bit more free-
dom back. which just goes to show that
government can do so much by simply
choosing to do less.

The Fartn Subsidy program is another ex-
ample of government kowtowing to spe-
cial-interests and paying vast sums of
“money to people who are already richer
than you or] will ever dream of becom»
ing. Oh, wait: that would be the Republie
canrsupported Sugar Subsidy program.
‘Okay: it‘s a wasteful, ri-
diculous program that al-
lows farmers to plant crops
in areas that can‘t support
them, and wastes a ton of
water. No, I guess that
would be 'the Republican-
supported Southern Califor-
nia Rice Growers subsidy.
Well. that means that the
Farm Subsidy program
must be that program that’s
keeping thousands of
American farmers from go-
ing bankmpt and losing ev-
erything they have. That‘s
right! I guess Republicans
are right when they say that,
generally, governmental in-
trusion into the private sec,
tor is bad. They’re just
wrong about which intru-
sions are bad, and which
aren’t. Maybe if a rich,
powerful PAC of Iowan
farmers donated a couple
million dollars to the GOP,
they‘d change their minds!
>Worked for the sugar planters and the rice
growers!

Republicans argue for a pure capitalist
system: "lfthese farmers can’t make it on
their own, let them go bankrupt. It‘s the

.American way!" This is the same argu-
ment they used against welfare (“It’s the

poor‘s fault that they’re poor!"), the same
argument some radical Republicans have
used against the minimum wage (”People
should compete to see who \will take the
least to do the job. It saves big-business
millions so that the CEO can afford a tenth
house in Hawaii!“), despite the fact that
minimum wage earners
today can work a 40rhour
week and still be below
the poverty line. And, ri-
nally, the truth of the
matter is, the budget for
the Farm Subsidy pro
grain is a pittance when
compared to all the un-
necessary defense spend-
ing. corporate tax breaks.
and big-business tax
loopholes that the Re-
publicans are so gungrho
’ about. So don‘t let the
GOP sell you on kicking
farmers off of land that's
been in their family for
generations because is
costs too much (94% of
all farms in America are
owned and operated by
families).

To sum it up, let’s re
view the opposition‘s
points: 1. It interferes
with the free market.
Hey. we do it all the time.
And it's a good thing,

too. 2. It costs too much. This might be
the most cost-effective program the gov-
ernment has. 3. It’sjustabad idea. Since
when have Republicans been good at spot-
ting bad ideas?

Note: Let me say before I begin to debunk the May myth that Bruce Friedrich created, I am writing this
piece in the Grinnell tradition of spirited debate as the best vehicle for becoming an informed citizen. With
that in mind, let‘s have some fun.

In Bruce Fricdrich's “radically chic" piece of May 3, 1996.1he afﬂicted will find little comfort in the
fact that their selfrappointed hero makes a specious argument built on incomplete data and a paranoid
Weltanschauung.

Level of Defense Spending

First, some facts and ﬁgures about the Defense budget, The Department of Defense (DoD) is in the pro
cess of outlaying (the government term for actually spending) $254,313 in Fiscal Year 1996 (FY96). This
represents a 3.7% de-
cline in real terms from
FY95 (adjusting for in-
flation, though at a more
reasonable rate than the

cline in the real growth
of Defense outlays con—
tinues nearly uninter-
rupted through the year
2001, when DoD outlays
will total $256.61}.
When compared to the
FY96 ﬁgure, this repre-
sents a scant nominal in-
crease and a real decline
in purchasing power of
over 10%. All this at a
time when non-discretionary spending on entitlements such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is
growmg in real terms.

Friedrich cites a statistic from Larry Korb, a former Defense ofﬁcial under Ronald Reagan and now an
analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., that implies Bill Clinton is spending more on
defense (in real terms) than Richard Nixon did some two decades ago. This is a somewhat deceitful use of
statistics for two reasons. First, Korb often uses 1973 and 1974 as base years in his comparisons. These
years represent the nadir ofAmerican military preparedness and effectiveness in the last half century. By
contrast, today’s force is extremely well prepared and effective; all for, using Korb‘s statistics, a marginal
increase in real spending of roughly 10%. Second, any real comparison of defense spending across such a
large time span must take into account the overall size of the U.S. economy. Only then can one gain a real
sense, across generations, of how much is being spent on Defense. Defense spending was between 5.5%
and 6.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during Nixon‘s shortened second term. Under Clinton, De-
fense spending is currently just under 4.0% of GDP. In fact, this is lowest level of Defense spending in
terms of GDP since be
fore World War 11. Con-
versely, spending on en-
titlements continues on

claims.

Friedrich rattles off sev»
eral statistics that show
U.S. Defense spending to
be disproportionately
high when compared
with the rest of the World .
(though he conveniently
does not discuss nations
such as China and India). ,
Military spending priorities in the U.S. are driven by American values and culture. Americans value the
individual and place a premium on human life. Our military spending priorities reﬂect this mostAmerican
characteristic by emphasizing technological solutions to the problems of warfare. Saddam Hussein or Kim
11 Song would much rather throw people at :1 military problem. What a convenient solution for leaders who
do not exercise power in a democracy—save money, spend lives. The American people demand a fighting
force that limits casualties to the maximum extent practical. The result is a staterofrthe-art military that
strives to reduce risk, conserve effort, and precisely apply force.

Neocolonial Control

1 will not go into detail with respect to Friedrich’s neocolonial claims, Nevertheless, I will state that
hungry, tired, and frightened Rwandans, Haitians, Bosnians, and Somalis immediately recognized the are
rival ofArnerican troops as a necessary condition for improving their lives. Our military missions to these
far away lands have nothing to do with geostrategic rape and pillage (or some might argue, the national
interest), The United States is the preferred international security partner because of our commitment to
economic and political freedom. American military presence proVides stability in key parts of the world,
This in turn leads to the proliferation of economic prosperity. free trade. and democracy. For example, can
anyone argue with a straight face that the economic boom happening throughout the Pacific Rim does not
owe much of its success to the steadying and balancing inﬂuence of the American military?

Wealth Transfer Up

Friedrich claims that the Defense budget transfers money away from the poorest Americans and to the
richest Americans. Nonsense. Friedrich focuses on the chief executive ofﬁcers of major aerospace and
defense contractors who make hefty salaries. But Friedrich overlooks the thousands of factory Workers and
skilled technicians that the aerospace and defense segment of the national industrial base keeps employed.
I suspect Friedrich has never visited a defense plant and spoken to any of the “afﬂicted” he claims to
represent. Friedrich should viSit the welder at Electric Boat or the line worker at Boeing before he claims
that Defense spending is a one-way wealth transfer to the richest Americans.

Additionally, Friedrich fails to consider the opportunities that military service provides for upward mobil»
ity, especially to minority and underpriviliged young people, Military service and GI Bill educational ben-
