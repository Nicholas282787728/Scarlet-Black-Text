Thursday afrernoon a sweer young lady sar
ar rhc promorion sable rrying desperarely ro
gcr people ro sign up for ncxr wcck’s blood
drive. And, as she sar, she warched rhe clock
rick.

Around 6:45 CST a large group of people
enrered rhe ﬁrsr ser ofdoiible doors, and rhen
rhe second, and rheri proceeded direcrly ro rhe
fronr ofshe line, scanned rheir collecrivc cards
and lcad'rhe parade ro rhe venerable pasra bar.

The swcer young lady previously men.
rioned sar in shock, appalled by rhc facr rhar
rhese people had just jumped in fronr ofa good
rwenry srudenrs in line.

“Hmm. . . she pondered. “I wonderwhar
gave rhem rhe righr ro do that?” Then, amidsr
rhc rampanr complaining coming from Lhc end
ofrhe line, rhe answer ro her qucsrion came ro
her likea27o pound lineman. Thcyweteath»

lercs! And rhey had jusr gorren out of praise '

rice, so ofcourse rhey had rhe righi ro cur in
line!

And why were all ofrhese people complain—
ing? They had no real righr ro, of course,
Anybody could see rhar. These normal sru.
denrs should have been happy, even proud, ro
give up rheir spors in line for arhleres. By do-
ing so, rhey are, wirhour a doubs, making rhis
school a berrcr place for all orus.

This, as any rarionai rhinker can clearly see,
follows direcrly from rhe facr rhar arhlercs are
berrer people rhan rhose orhers.

Heres why. Arhleres perhaps do more in
one day ofpracrice rhan non-arhleres do in a
week. Scienriﬁcsourecssupporr rhisi‘aer. The

Body Enhancing Empowermenr Righteous»
ness (BEER) group, a pars ofThe Narional
Eoundarion for rhe Advancemenr of rhe Su»
perior Narure oIArhleres in rhis Peon World,
found in a highly srrucrured scienriﬁc srudy
rhar rhc average achleres hears acrually bears
fasrer rhan rhe normal srudenrs.

Ifyon really rake rhe rime ro rhink about
is, rhis makes sense. Running around on a
ﬁeld or camp is much more rigorous rhan sir»
ringin Eurlingallclay, And, rhis inrense physi-
cal acriviry makes arhleres hungrier rhan nor-
mal people roo. And everyone rhar has a brain
knows rhas people who are hungry, especially
if diey are arhleres, are just more imporranr
rhan people rhar aren’r hungry, so rhey should
be able ro cur in line. -

Also, arhleres, unlike normal srudenrs, have
no conrrol over when rhey are going ro ,ear.
They really have ro car when pracrice is over,
ar no orher rime. The urrer luxury ofsrrolling
over ro Cowles, oh, somerime in rhe be at.
remoon, ro ger a nice arm meal is just nor an
oprion. And everyone knows rhis. So why
are rhere people in line ar she rime when prac.
rice ends? There is no excuse for rhis hrusque,
rude insensiiiviry rowards arhleres.

An arhlere who wish ro be nidenriﬁed
gave a rheory abour rhis insensiriviry. “I guess
rhey probably just go ro dinner ar rhe same
rime we do because rhey wanr ro be near us.
Afrer all, we are berrer rhan rhem, and maybe
rhey rhink rhar whar is good abour us will be
rransferred ro rhem rlirough osmosis or some.
rhing like that.”

Ar ﬁrsr, I rhoughr shis rheory ro be a nine
weak, bur upon considering ir furrher, I can
come ro bur one conclusion.

Iwould like so call all arhleres ro conrinue
ro cur in line, and maybe even sign a peririon
ro ger a separare line made just for arhleres.
Or maybe even a separare dining hall.

For rhis fall season, rhe Griffins have 20+

The ream also has a springseason duringwhich

Players join rhe Grifﬁns from differenr
backgrounds, bur shey all srress rhe fun and
friendship which playing rugby gives, “1 rhink
rugby is rhe besr sporr in building ream Gama»
raderie,“ said husramanre. A parricular poinr
ofpride for she squad is rhe way in which stu—
dcnrs and rownspeople play rogerhcr. Accord-
ing ro Smirh, rhe Grifﬁns are r’he largesr social
club rhar combines rlie ovo groups ofpeople
as equals,

Because rugby is nor a well known sporr,
eirher narionally or ar Grinnell, rhere are many
misconceprions abour rhe narure ofsporr. says

Chainerski, “People rhink you you have re
be big, bur you don’t." Busramanrc adds rliar,
conrrary so popular belief, rugby is nor a vie
cious sporr,

This social aspecr ofrugby has helped build a
frarernisy amongsr players; horli young and

said Smirh, ”You auromarically have rcspecr
for rhem,"

Rugby in Grinnell srarred in 1976, Origie
