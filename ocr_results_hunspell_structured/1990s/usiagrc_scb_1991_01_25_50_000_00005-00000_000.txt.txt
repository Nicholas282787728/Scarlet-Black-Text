January 25, 1991

The PersianGulfCrisrs hasbccn
a hot issue at Grinncll since last
semester, with concern growing
over the recent turn of events.

Now. the crisis has escalated
into war. and it touches many lives
in some way. it has affcclcd the
Airicricaneconomy. Somestudents
and faculty have relatives or friends
stationed in the Gulf. Many Inale
students fear that the draft will be
reinstated. As a result of this in
creasing concern, a few students
have tried to do what they can to
end the war.

Last semester, two groups di-
rcctlyrolaiedtolheGull Crisis were
formed. ScoltWittstruck and Dan
Werner founded the Persian Gulf
Alert (PGA), an organization that
keeps students informed as to what
they can do to voice their opinions
about the war.

Kris Tapp formed the Grinuell
Draft Counseling Organization
(GDCO),which informs students
whattheycandoaboutthedrattand
helpslhcm put together aconscien-
tious objector file.

Before Grinnell broke for win-
ler vacation, the threat of war was
growing, with the United Nations'
January 15th deadline tast ap-
proaching. Members of PGA tied
green ribbons around campus and
wore them to signify their unity.
The message from PGA was that
everyone should stay active over
break, even though they would be
geogmphicallyseparatedontheday
of the UN. deadline.

Grinnell studentlon Cook went
to two rallies, one in Rochester,
N.Y. and one in Newark. NJ.

Cook also tried to get a draft
counselor to talk to students at his
old high school. The principal did
not agree to have the couselorvisit,
but Cook was successful in initial»
ing a few informal group discus»
sions He also called and wrote his
representative during the congres-
sional vote.

On January 15th,coincidentaily
Martin Luther King, .ir.’s birthday,
Andrew Walter ’94 took pan in a
march in Atlanta. Georgia to pro-
test U.S. military intervention and
emphasize the success of King's
non-violence. A thousand people
attended the march.

Gail Francis '94 was at a large
protest in San Francisco, in which
an estimated four to eight thousand
people participated. The event be
gan early on the morning of the
15m. when protesters linked arms

the Federal building, Police used

tear gas, mace and electric night
sticks to separate the protesters.

Protestors then circled the
building and latcrmarchcd through
the city, taking over the Bay bridge
for zi couple of hours.

Wittstruck was active in his
home town ol’Columbia, Missouri.
He wrote his senators, rcprescnlaa
tive, and President Bush. On 52!an
ary 14th, he coordinated a rally
attended by 800 people. Artery
wards, there was zi march to the US
army recruiiment center, where
some stayed overnight.

At a January 16th demonstra-
tion, Wittstruck gave a speech and
W: later attacked by counter-dem-
onstrators. The incident was broa
ken up by the police.

The following day, Wittstruck
addressed another rally. The dem-
onstrators marched to the ofﬁce of
their representative, who had voted
for military action in the Gulf.

Instead of voicing his opposia
tion to the war by protesting,
Howard Greenwich worked on his
conscientious objector (CO) l‘ile
over break. A member of the Indi-
vidual Ready Reserve, he was in
the army from 1985 to 1988 and is
on inactive duty until 1992.

While in the military, Green-
wich realized that his beliefs were
“unequivicably incompatible with
the army." Last semester, hebegan
putting together the CO ﬁle. which
has not yet been approved.

“It was the hardest thing I have
ever written," saidGrecnwich,who
might still be called up for duty in
thc Gulf. “lam devoting much en-
ergy to resisting the war through
resisting the military and supportr
ing CO‘s. I plan to continue this
course of action."

This is Just zi sampling of Grin-
