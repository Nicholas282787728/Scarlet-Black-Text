SEX:Thorson-Smith advocates LIPSHUTZ: "Go ahead:
sexual leniency for church

and a half hours of debate, and at-
tempted in committee after commilr
tee to change words and revise sec-
tions of the report.

Thorson—Smith’s 15 minutevideo,
produced by the Presbyterian Church
for educationalpurposes,highlighted
moments of the Assembly, The video
consistedlargely of statements made
during the debate by representatives
of presbyien'es around the country.
These ranged in opinion from tlte
conservative, who found the report to
be “unscriptural and unwise" and in
discord with the teachingsof theBible,
to those of a more liberal stance, who
considered change an important step
in keeping with the true teachings of
Jesus.

“Keep in mind", said one member
in favor of the report. “that this is a
‘reforrned’ Church."

“Reformed Church“ or not, over
90% of the Assembly voted against
adoption of the repon, citing among
other reasons their traditional beliefs
in the authority of Scripture and the
sanctity of marriage This came as a
disappointment but not a shock to
Thorson~Smith and her colleagues,
who were aware of the controversial
aspects of the report.

Despite the overwhelming vote
against the report, defeat is not total,
according to Thorson-Smith. The re-

portremains in study, and is used as a
reference for other studies currently
being conducted.

According to Thorson-Smith,
more and more gays and lesbians are
leaving lthhurch, in hopes that they
will find the dignity and compassion
espoused by Christian teaching in
othcrchurchcs. One lesbian, in aparr
ticularly moving letter, compared her
relationship with the Church to the
relationshipbetweenawoman and an
abusive husband; both want to stay,
butfinally reach their breaking point
and must leave the relationship in
order to save themselves.

Others, however, are staying in
the Church in hopes that things will
change. In some areas, changes have
already been made, independent of
any action taken by the General As-
sembly. In New York and the Twin
Cities, for example, presbyteries are
requesting the ordination of homo
sexuals,and in Rochester, NY, one of
aChurch’s four ministers isalcsbian.

These changes are few and far
between, to be sure, but Thorson-
Smith remains optimistic. Once
people understand that this is human
sexuality, “felt across the board". she
stated, then people will be ready to
change. This report did not create a
conﬂict within the Church, it simply
named it, she asserted. The conﬂict
was already there, already being felt
by members across the nation. Now

that this conflict, this pain, is named
and identified as discrimination, it
can be dealt with.

The presentation ended with ques
tions and comments. The flip side of
the argument was presented by one
student who pointed out that those
who oppose these “reforms", those
whofoilow lhcrulcswhich havcstood
for centuries, are now being made to
feel ostracized by those who wish to
change them. Why should we be dis
criminated against, shc demanded,
when all we are doing is upholding
the original laws of the Church?

Is it reverse discrimination then?
How much can one expect to change
with the times without losing what is
important to any tradition? Thorson-
Smith granted that the Bible is the
Presbyterian authority, but stated that
interpretation of the Bible is key, that
one must look beyond its cultural
times to see its broader themes of
love, compassion and justice. Jesus,
she stated, never mentioned homo-
sexuality. Why should Christians,
then, adhere to the codes created in
Old Testament times when the les-
sonsofJesuscentered on “good news”
and love?

The importance of the Grinnell
community LoThorsonvSmith became
evidentat the end of the presentation,
when she thanked everyone who had
supported her during the timeshe was
on theSpecialCommittce. She closed
simply wtth, “Keen up the passion.”

economic privilege in the United
States, too. We console ourselves that
abortion will never be made illegal on
the national scale and that a woman
could always travel to another state if
she needed to. if the reins are light-
ened however, I don’t think that it
unreasonable to envision our state
governments as capable of a similar
sort of action to that of Ireland‘s.
Wouldn’tthisunconstitutionallylimit
our freedom of movement, though”!
Without doubt. And it wouldn't be
the ﬁrst time that the Supreme Court
has tread upon our hallowed Bill of
Rights.

With the Court‘s decision in the

“Rust vs Sullivan" case last May,our
first amendment rights were clearly
disregardedi'i‘heCourtupheldaregur
lation prohibiting federally funded
family-planning clinics from even
discussing abortion as an option (the
”gag rule”). Both our right to free
speech and over 4000 clinics were
affected by this ruling.

During a letter writing campaign
last semester to overturn this rttling, I
heard, “It doesn’t matter. Abortion
will still be legal in most states If
someone needs an abortion, she’ll be
able to get one.” Let's not kid our-
selves. Women without money are
sorely discriminated against. Abor—
tion may stay accessible for those
who can afford it, butevcn that is not
guaranteed,

The lounge will beremodelcdwith
rubber furniture, padded walls and
puke-proof carpeting. All bathrooms
will be equipped with specially de-
signed toiletseats containing chin and
arrnrests. Stairs will be abolished in
favor of paved ramps with geriatric

safely transport especially addicted
students to their floors.

The water fountains will run off

and lofts will be forbidden.

With such revolutionarymeasures,
the staffoftheSmrlet andBlack feels
that Grinnell will regain its place on
the U .S . New: and World Report list
of top wn small liberal arts colleges.

We feel safe and snug in our coun-
try protected by “freedom and justice
for all”. No one in the US. govem-
mentwouldlimitourrighttopublicly
discuss a case as the Attomey Gen-
eral ofIreland did, claiming that any
public discussion of the abortion case
beforea judge ruled would beconsid-
ered in “contempt of court". We’d
consider that ridiculous. Of course,
we have organizationsliketthambs
of Christ operating in the Midwest. In
one town, the group followed a
doctor's daughter to school, taunting
her with the cries that her mother
“murders babies". In Louisiana, a
doctor “who commits the crime of
abortion" maybeﬁned up to$ 10,000.
Good thing we're so civilized.

With lhcelcctions coming up, and

When you were in elementary school

We are reaching the level of com

with the intellectual horsepower to

doctor in Grinnell. If you don't have
the cash on hand and are not insured
by one of the few organimlions that
covers doctors fees up front, tough.

Such behavior, though, is hardly
unusual tor Linnnetl, which harbors
northeast of Sixth and Park a mecca
for politics that are a pathetic mixture
ofthebanal and theignorant.Grinnell
students all too often combine the
dishonesty of refusing to admit the
existence of cenain facts of life and
the hypocrisy of claiming a general
political position while opposing all
that is meaningful about that stance.
Of those who are politically vocal,
the activists of the community ser
vice center and Poverty Action Now
are heavily outnumbered by terribly
blinkcred people who are too obsessed
with their own single issues to argue
for a broader vision.

So where does the smart money lie
for a political future for Grinnell's
student body? Notwith the blinkered,
small-minded or politically clueless.
One might do better to look at Ver-

monl,a traditionally Republican state 1
whose voters are so true blue that
they barely even supported Johnson I
in 1964. Its voters broke the habit of

a lifetime and installed Bemie Sand-
ers,America‘s firstpost—warSocialist
Congressman in 1990. In doing so
they turret] out an incumbent Repub»
lican(thcrecession reached Vermont '
early) and kept with tradition only i
insofar as they yet again overlooked
the Democrat. Now Satlders’ reelec-
tion campaign is attracting the sup-
port of organizers from Canada’s
democratic socialist party, the New
Democrats. They doubtlessly eye '
further opportunities for expansion in
the political vacuum thatexists south
of the 49th parallel.

Grinnell could do wih an organi-
zation of the New Democratic Party's
genre to fill its own vacuum and re-
vive campus politics. But it is un-
likely to happen. Grinnell students,
with their fanatical fear of collective
responsibility and genuine reform.
do not strike me as being the market
for such a venture. Please correct me
if I‘m wrong.

friendly reception they receive there.
When ARI-l was under construction,
lounges all over campus were being
used the sameway. Never did anyone
walk into Ira Strauber's Intro to P0—
litical Science class (Younker
Lounge) asking if he would be done
soon so they could have a nice game
of Bridge. We don’t think the com-
plaints from Main Hall residents, or

thosefromthezirtstudcnts themselves, ,
are at all illegitimate. However, there
are proper channels through which
complaints may be voiced. These
channels are not through professors
or students in the classes, especially
not during classtime. Until students
are provided safe facilities, the situa-
tion will not change, Hopefully the
attitudes of Main Hall residents will.
