SGA Elections

To the Campus Community,

As you all know, the annual SGA
Elections took place just before
Spring Break. After running for SGA
President last year, 1 developed a
certain fondness for the election pro-
cess. This Was because during last
year’s elections, it seemed that more
people than
ever were exn
cited about
being at Grinv
hell and were
interested in
taking pan in
the College‘s
self-govern»
ing processes.
The elections
excited me so
much, that I
went On [0 be-
come the
chair of this
year's SGA
E lec ti o n s.
Needless to
say, I had
been looking
forward to
March with great anticipation.

As elections neared, I hoped that
signs put up last year which blatantly
disrespected two International Stu-
dent candidates were merely an ab
enation. However, I found this year
that those signs only began to touch
the surface in reﬂecting the unnec-
essary hatred and disrespect which
Grinnell students often show toward
one another. The elections this year
were neither as smooth, nor as en-
couraging as the elections which
took place one year ago. While each
of this year’s candidates had many
creative ideas to offer, much of the
positivity which was present was
overshadowed by a great deal of
negativity, hatred and cynicism.

March. those involved in the elec-
tions had numerous signs stolen, tom
down, ripped and in some instances
even burned. Many students also
chose to use this year's Debate as a
chance to direct accusations at can
didates which were often based on
rumor rather than fact. Finally, there
were extremely tasteless signs posted
claiming to be authored by one ofthe
c a n d i d a te s
when indeed
they were
not. It seems
that many
students used
these elec-
tions as an at-
tempt dis-
credit and at-
tack candi-
dates person—
ally rather
than focus on
ideas and a
vision for the
future of the
College. In-
stead of being
about the
well being of
- the Grinnell
Campus, this election ended up be-
ing about students’ personal dislike
for one another. I often feel m though
I could have prevented some of these
unfortunate events by establishing
more firm election guidelines. How
ever, it has been my philosophy that
at Grinnell, we should have as few
rules as possible.

Now that the elections are long
over, I am left with no other impresn
sion than that these negative events
were a manifestation of many stun
dents’ intolerance and disrespect for
one another. Although I am leaving
Grinnell aﬁer this year, these things
trouble me greatly. Self— governance
means that the College Administra-
tion tntsts the student body to show
the responsibility and maturity nec-

essary to work together and maintain
the well betng of the Campus. The
events which have taken place leave
me wondering whether or not we are
up to the task. If we cannot learn to
put aside our personal differences
and work together toward our goals,
then we have learned nothing in our
four (or sometimes ﬁve) years here.

So, I encourage those students who
chose to express themselves through
anonymous acts of hatred, intolere
once and disrespect to find more cone
structive, respectful ways to voice
your opinions. Only by working
with, rather than against our adverr
saries, can we bring about meaningr
ful change.

Goat Incident

Editor, The S and B:

While ﬂipping through the March
7 issue of The S and B, I noticed an
article which, to say the least,
shocked me. I live down the hall
from this “Neil Marlin," but I never
took the time to get to know my
ﬂoorrnate. Thanks to the article re-
garding his recent behaviors, I don‘t
plan to make any effort to befriend
him. The idea that a student of this
superb institution would treat a
Capra hirsu: with anything less than
the utmost respect gdisgustsA me.
Also, Iwas very concerned with the
response of the “officer on duty"
when he was confronted with the
poor goat and the vicious Martin.
The officer actually ”rushed [the
goat] to the Grinnell College Health
Center for emergency treatment“??
This was quite puzzling to me—why

was the goat not immediately placed
into the care ofa trained veteranarian
or, at the very least. transported to
the local hospital, where there surely
would be better facilities than at the
Health Center, where the strongest
medication is ibuprofen? This
strange treatment of the goat even
leads me to believe that the sorcalled
“officer on duty" actuallyhad some-
thing to do with the goat-beating.
Not to mention that the Grinnell Col-
lege Health Center is CLOSED ev-
ery weekday after ﬁve o‘clock—and
the goat incident occurred “on the
evening ofSalurday March I, 1997"
(emphasis mine). Obviously, there
is some sort of cover~up going on.

There are further implications in the
article that the events were a bit
suspicious:“Neil
Martin...suffered“stitches on his
upper left thigh...“ This indicates that
during Martin‘s scufﬂe, he endured
STITCHES from the goat as well as
bruises. How likely is it that a “doe
mesticated goat” can give a Harna
sapien stitches? Also, I don‘t want
to make any assumations here, but it
seems a lirrle odd that the wound was
on Martin‘s “upper left thigh.“ To
me, this indicates a sexual struggle.
I propose a confrontation with both
Martin and the goat to ﬁnd out exA
actly what transpired on the evening
of March 1.

To conclude, I am not at all com»
fortable any longer with living on the
same ﬂoor as this Neil character, es
pecially since I recently purchased a
dwarf rabbit. I, for one, hope that
the restraining order the goat-owner
is seeking will be placed on Martin:
not only for the goat but for all ani-
mals, effective immediately.

Thank you.

OP ON
GASPS speaks out

As a member of GASPS
(Grinnellians Against Smoking in
Public Spaces), I was pleased to see
posters located in prominent places
on campus that stressed the legal
rights of sensitive nonsmokers. Iflrst
noticed these signs on the afternoon
oprril 9, That same evening, sev-
eral friends and I walked along South
Campus’s loggia and gathered to
gether the tattered remnants of these
posters.

It was astonishing to see freedom

of expression and thought being an— .

nihilated in such a manner on Grin-
nell College’s campus. I had ex-
pected that numerous derogatory re-
marks would quickly be scrawled
across the signs, but I did not imag—
ine the intolerance would include
actual removal of these posters from
the sight of other students, faculty
members, and the administration.

The written viliﬁcation of GASPS
members that I had anticipated
would have been disrespectful, but
far more accepting than the physical
destruction of the signs themselves.
The obliteration of GASPS’S signs
shows a lack of tolerance for differ-
ing views, ideas, and opinions that
should instead be allowed to ﬂour-
ish in an academic community.

Cronos

In 1535, an alchemist builds an ex-
traordinary mechanism encapsulated
into a small golden device. The in
vention, designed to convey eternal
life to its owner, survives its maker
until 1997 when it shows up to an
antiquarian, Fascinated with the
strange device, Gris (Luppi) doesn’t
note that there‘s more than one per-
son looking for it. The promise of
eternal life has become an obsession
to old and sick Mr. De la Guardia
(Brook). He and his nephew
(Perlman) will do anything to get the
“Chronos Invention".

Breaking the Waves

Drama set in a repressed, deeply re-
ligious community in the north of
Scotland, where a naive young
woman named Bess McNeil (Emily
Watson) meets and falls in love with
Danish oil-rig worker Jan (Stellan
Skarsgaard). Bess and Jan are deeply
in love but, when Jan retums to his
rig, Bess prays to God that he returns
for good. Jan does retum. his neck
broken in an accident aboard the rig. ‘
Because of his condition, Jan and
Bess are now unable to enjoy a
sexual relationship and Jan urges
Bess to take another lover and tell
him the details, As Bess becomes
more and more de'viant in her sexual
behaviour, the more she comes to
believe that her actions are guided
by God and are helping Jan recover.
