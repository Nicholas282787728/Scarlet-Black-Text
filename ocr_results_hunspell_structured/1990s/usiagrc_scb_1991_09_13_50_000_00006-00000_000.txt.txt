Let Peace Day
serve its purpose

The decision to move Face Day to the fall benefits the entire
campus. Addressing issues requires good timing and students have more
time and energy at the beginning of the school year, rejuvenated from the
summer, than at the tail end of a semester of academia.

A fall Peace Day is a good opportunity for campus groups to be
visible and to gain the interest of potential members. Students are still
deciding on their schedules early in the year and may be more generous with
their Lime when academic pressure is relatively low.

It is important to keep in mind the nature of Grinnell College. The

Grinnell environment fosters in-
volvement and a majority of

EDITORIAL

Grinnellians spend much of their
school year actively exploring vari-
ous issues and working for change
Consciousness-raising in the spring
simply does not allow enough lead-
time for students to work on the issues discussed during Peace Day. At best,
a spring Peace Day is too little too late. At worst, it is a clear indication of
student burn-out

last spring is a case in point: Peace Day was scheduled on “relays"
weekend, an event in past years which served as a day for students to blow
off steam before the finals crunch, Students should not have to choose
between personal release and personal growth. Both hard work and relax—
ation are essential to a student’s mental health and academic succws.

Peace Day should not be an afterthought. Scheduling a day of
workshops. speakers, and panel discussions late in the spring relegates Peace
Day to apep rally. a sort of last burst for thesummer or as preparation for the
next fall.

Last fall the Scarlet and Black ran articles protesting apathy on
Grinnell campus. Good attendance at Peace Day ‘91 should dispel any myths
about Grinnell students’ genuine concern and involvement in issues of

peace.

EYES WIDE

OPEN

Grinnell homosexual community a
family—efor better or for worse

A most fascinating thing hap»
pened to me last week: I was trans-
ported back in time. Ifound myselfat
the beginning of the 1988789 school
year, sitting in a room crammed full
of selfrproclaimed homosexuals and
(a few) onrlookers. Only last week I

wasn't trying to keep my mouth
shut but wantng to scream, “YES!
Yes it’s true! IAMoncl lam Queer!"
Instead I was one of several. sitting
back coolly, not really needing to
cxplainmyselfmy handrcstinggenr
tly on my lover‘s knee.

A few things remain the same.
Three years ago I was sitting beside
the same womon, maybe not with my
hand on her knee, but sitting very
close nonetheless. and doing so most
deﬁnitely because of the crowded
room. There were old tensions in the
room last week. Tensions leftover
from things said and unsatd at meetr
ings in the past hung forebodingly in
the air. It was the same tone that
clouded the room of the fust meeting,
onlyl was too enrapturcd by lhepl’eSr
ence of Community to notice, and far
too new to know the histories. I was

Shelly West

not aware of the smallness of
Grinnell's Queer Community. Sev-
eral months is long enough to learn
each other’s annoying habits, con-
ﬂicting political agendas, and incon-
gruent social stratification. (The
Queers come from all over, often
with very littlein common. They hold
on tight.)

Some things were radically differ-
em. The name of the place we metfor
one has been changedialthough not
yet officially. Soon the distinction
will no longer be made between hu-
mans and gays. We will instead unite
under a symbol of unification for all
lesbians, gays and bisexuals. Our
space has been renovated. It’s very
snazzy and kept up well by the over-
whelmingly supportiveAssistantDir
rector and the (sublime) Student As-
sistant. We have a voice. The Les-
bian/Etsexual/Gay Presrdential Task
Force is off and running. Wc are
carving out our path through the ad

ministrative red tape. And we have
numbers.Goodncss.dowehavenuma
bers! Queer people in droves. Every»
where I look, my Queer sisters and
brothers stand out. It seems as if the
Queersareincontrol-of their voice,
of their community, of their visibilv
ity. Of themselves? Ah, we can only
hope.

The all-campus non-affiliated gay,
lesbianand bisexualmeelingsecmed
to be an awful lot like a family “3.
union. A brief. rare chance to bewith
those to whom you can relate on at
least one major level. And we all are
“family,”aren’twe? Muehlikc fami-
lies, you don't get to choose who‘s in
the group—you take what you get.
Dissonance is natural. remember? But
when times get hard you certainly
appreciate those who come around.
Despite painfully separate political
goals and social desires, despite the
lack of enthusiasm of some and the
overabundantcagcmess of others. we
must remain united. We do, and, I
believe, we will, remain united.

 

FRIENDLY FIRE

Will the real Democratic
candidate please stand up?

Admit it. You're pissed off.

Maybe that’s a bit strong, but at
the very least you‘re feeling cheated,
deprived of an expeticnce unique to
Grinnell. robbed ofan institution that
transcends theordinary collegeexpca
tience.

I‘m not talking about the new din-
ing hall policy that strips students of
therighttomake theirown sacklunch,
although you have every right to be
upset about that. Nor am I talking
about the recent abduction of regis-
tration from Darby Gymnasium to
the land of the academic disco ball.
What I am talking about are Demo-
crats. or the absence thereof.

We’re less than six months away
from the fabled Iowa Caucus, and it's
easier to find a Communist in Saint
Petersburg (or Leningrad. for all of
you still stuck in last week's Old
World Order) than a Democratic presi—
dentialcandidatein Grinnell,or allof
Iowa for that matter. Let’s face it,
ladies and gentlemen. while we did
come to Grinnell for a first-rate edur
cation and a laid-back social life, the
idea of schmoozing wtth Jesse Jack-
son or Mario Cuomo in the Forum
GrillwhileDanRather,PeterJennings
and Tom Brokaw look on, was al-
ways present somewhere in your
mind.

You‘d return home for break and
maybe run into a friend you hadn’t

Josh Ford

seen since high school graduation.
They’d ask what you were up to. and
you‘d mention classes and maybe a
movie you had seen and then, real
cool, as if it were no more important
than matching a load of white socks,
“Oh, and I shared an order of fries
with Mario."

You wouldn’t have to explain
which “Mario" you were talking
about.GovemorCuomohasachieved
that level of importance shared only
with such greatsoflatc twentiethcen»
turylifeas”lke."“Mao,“”Madonna"
and “Saddam."

If, like myself, you have the plea
sure of hailing from the northeast
(gasp! now you know I‘m a snob) the
next time you had the ceremonial
“Comell?» No, Grinnell.- Where‘s
that?....0h. I’m sorry. why did you
do that?": you could bmsh the of4
fending eastemer off with the smug
satisfaction of knowing that they
would never eat french fries with
Mario.

But now those dreams have been
desert stormed and schwarzkopfed
(my own personal verbs) and the Iowa
Caucus has been reduced in impor-
tance to the level of the bronze medal
match of learn handball in the Olym-

pics.

George Bush has already been re4
elected, in case you haven't heard,
and is currently enjoying a level of )
popularity slightly lower than thatof
Mother Theresa. Of course, until a
certainunnamedemiratewasinvadcd,
thePresident-rerelecthadallthe mak-
ings of a Republican Jimmy Carter.

In 1988 all seven Democratic
dwarfs heighrhoed their way through
Grinnell, even George Bush (back in
the days before Terry Brandstad made
this a dangerous stop for Republir
cans) came through town if not
through campus, In 1992 we’ll be
lucky to get Paul “I’mjust your aver-
age Greek from Massachusetts run
ning for President“ Tsongas and the
Ice Capades.

Of course Senator Tom Harkin,
fresh from his victory over former
Congressman Tom Taukey will prob-
ably run, but he doesn‘t count. Gct~
ting excited about Tom Harkin com
ing to Grinnell is like getting excited
about Dan Quayle going to play golf
in Indiana.

Luckily though, we have a solu-
tioanrinnell College can be offi-
cially designated as the official loca-
tion of the 1992 Democratic
Unconvention.
