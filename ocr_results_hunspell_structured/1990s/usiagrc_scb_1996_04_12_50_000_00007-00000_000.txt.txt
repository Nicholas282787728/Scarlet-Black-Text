Violations included Cxtmludlcinl

WE DEMAND THAT “DISAPPEARANCES,” A FORM OF STATE KIDNAPPING, CEASE.

We are all indebted to Amnesty International, especially those who are familiar with the taste of prison bread and the
conditions of life behind bars. For Political Prisoners the awareness that someone thought about them and demanded
their release had a particular value: It was like a ray of light in the middle of the night.

Every day someone somewhere gets imprisoned. Amnesty International offers daily help to those who need it most.
Solidarity with this institution is for us an element of European identity, and it reminds us that every prisoner dimin»
ishes our own freedom. «Prisoner of Conscience Held in Poland

Abolishithe DeathiPena t

one of Amnesty/s other missions is their campaign to

abolish the clenth penalty. Last rent, so Americans were gassed

rncstsince the late 19505 and neurlydouble thesi of 1994. This

people on death rotr , mostlv ii nancially poor men (MplsTi-ib, i.
1796). ‘

In 1995, 5 rlemhrow inmates were released ar'ter being
acquitted at new trails, bringing to 59 the number ordeeth tow
initiates released due to innocence since 1973. Presently, tireus
Congress is working to curb reviews in deiurmw casesmitl they
may even seek to elimlnare habeas corpus. The March srrrcrrse
Peace Newsletter has n harrowing list or some people, likely
innocent who were aculallyexecutcd it is more common than
we think.

in just one eithe documented cases, Leonel Torres Herrera
was sentenced to death tor the i982 murder or two police
omcers. Years alter his conviction. an nttomeywho represented
l‘lerteta’s brother cited evidence that the brother had Comtmtr

evidence he orcsenteti within 30 days ol the Conﬂctlon, Het—
tom's motion tor a new rrrel was denied.

The Supreme Court unlrtitl Texas’s decision by ruling that
Hermra’s elalm of ‘actual innocence’ was not a constitutional

claim. The court ruled that the constitution doesn t forbid _
execution ofan innocent personhs long as that person it ,h

perilously close to simple murder." Leone Herrera was executed

on May 12, 1993.

Amnestyrencrrs dmt54 countries have formallyabolished
the death penalty and at least 30 more nations hrwe heri‘nc
executions tor IO years All ofchc other orcn countries-hive
abolished the tieeth penalty. “A poll or the nation’s top ctty;
ofllcml: placed the dead\ penalty it the bottom or e list or
measures most likely to reduce crime" (NCR, 4-596).

The latest issue ul'Amnesty’s Magazine, after listing all the
stock reasons to oppose the tlenth penalty (including the extant
tron nrurnccsnrsl, explains: “But even irnons or these things
were true, we still ought not to favor the cleurh pernitrror‘ one
very simple reason: It perpetuates the very violence it is osten»
sibly designed to eradicate.

“The fact is that for the state to sanction the use ofv iolence
inevitably bestows upon violence the imprlmatur ore respect—
able solution to life's problems, Vioietrce in any form begets
more Violenceiand v tolence administered by the state tends to
add to the brutality afa society that may be plenty brutal in the
l'irst place."

It murder is menu the state ought not participate in it.
