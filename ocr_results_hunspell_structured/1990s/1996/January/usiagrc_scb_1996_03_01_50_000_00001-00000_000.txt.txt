Election reforms encourage higher voter turnout

SCOTT ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

After last year‘s dismal turnout
fortheSGApresitlentlalelections in
which only 500 Students voted, the
student—run election committee de<
cided that something needed to be
done.

They began by posting signs
across campus soliciting candidates
[0 run for SGA president There are
eight candidates for president and
three for \‘lCe»prESldEn( this year.
compared to six and two, respecuve»
ly, last year,

Students will ha» e many oppor-
tunities to meet the candidates in
the upcoming weekend. First, Chad
Jira Will interview the candidates on
his radio show from 34pm on Satur—
day.

The campaign moves on to the
Harris Centerthar nightivith aparty
organized by the candidates. This is
a good time for studenls [0 meet
them as they Will be stamping hands.

didnte debate \i-ill occur Monday,
March 4th at 7pm in the North
Lounge of the Forum. Each candt
date will speak for n few minutes and
thenthe ﬂoorwdlhe opentostudent
questions.

Finally, the vote occurs on
Wednesday, March 6th in the post
office. Extra people will be available
to collect votes during passing peri—
ods to lessen the lines that usually
occur. Because many students don't
go to the post office during the day,
they can also vote from 4:30 to
5:30pm at Quad and 5:30 to 6:30pm
at Cowles.

If no candidate wins by a major—
ity, there Will be a runoff on Friday
between as many candidates as nec«
essary to collect fifty percent of the
vote. This means ilmt ifthc topyote

getter receives forty percent of the
vote, the sccond twentypercenr, and
the third is percent, only the top
two candidates will be in the runoff
Ifrhe top vote getter only has thirty
percent, thc second fifteen, and the
third ten, then all three will partici—
pate in the runoff so at least fifty

percent ofthc first vote is represent»
ed.

There were many other ideas
considered to tncreascstudcnt’s abil/
ity to vote. The feasibility of con«
ducting voting through the VAX is
also being considered. The election
committee wanted to place ballots in
every student‘s post office box, but
the post office vetoed the idea be—
cause it was a political acttvrty.

While the election committee
has been able to publish information
about the candidates in the student
memo and the Scarlet and Black, the
dining hall has refused to allow the
information into the QC Gazette
because the information is consid»
cred political. Legally. the post office

candidates are: front row, from left Eric Baker, Trevor Porath, and Khutso Madubanya.
