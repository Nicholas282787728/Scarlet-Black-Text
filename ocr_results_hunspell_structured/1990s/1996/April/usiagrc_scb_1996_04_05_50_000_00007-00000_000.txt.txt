Nuclear Extortion

mitted to nuclear war as one option
in its offensrve and defensive war
strategy.

Nuclear Weapons in the Budget

Presently, the US retains over
15,000nuclearwatheads.andspends

Funding {or nuclear weapons
production rose in FY96 by 8.5%,
including $50 million for a new tri—
tiurn racility "to upgrade the explo—
sive power or our warheads" (WP).
Indeed, Bill Clinton has committed
unequivocally to "maintaining con»
fidence in the safety, reliability, and
performance of our [nuclear] weap<
ens."

Nuclear Testing Continues

Thus, testing of nuclear weap-
ons for “reliability" continues un-
abated with “neareweapons condi—
tions in laboratory experiments"
(DOE): high—tech lasers (132 ofrhem,
“each more powerful than any laser
elsewhere in the world") and particle
accelerators simulate nuclear explo-
sions; and nuclear weapon‘s effects
are measured with frequent above
ground high—explosive nuclear Simu»
luiioris. These tests are useful both
for study ofpresent weapons, and for
the design of new weapons (WP. 9—
19-95).

Amazingly, we also assisted
France in their recent tests, which
drew such condemnation from the
world community. Amazingly, none
of this censure rained down on the
United States, despite the fact that
the US cooperated with France in
these tests “to on unprecedented de-
gree," includinggivmg‘hccess to [W0
sophisticated new US nuclear weap—
ons research facilities," to help them
With their tests (WP).

Star Wars

Ballistic Missile Defense ("Star
Wars") saps $3 billion per year, and
now the Republicans want to have

The world community is unanimous
in condemnation orthis program. it

every single clay: Gerson suggest the
analogy of the bank robber uses a gun
to hold up a bank. He may not have
to fire the gun, but he has used his
weapon successfully if he gets away
with the goods. This analogy is apt
indeed. As less than 5% of the global

Us Nuclear History

Indeed, anyone who doubts US
willingness to use nuclear weapons,
please take note; Between 1945 and
1976, the United States deployed or
overtly threatened to use nuclear
weapons at least 33 times, despite
haying not once been under any overt
threat of nuclear attack (Gerson).
At Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the US
incinerated more than 250,000 hu—
man beings, almost all ciVilians. On
at least eight occasions, the Joint
Chiefs ofStaff(the military top lead<
ership) have recommended unpro—
yoked or preemptive nuclear attack
(listed in the Boston Globe. 5—30—
95). In each of these cases, the Pres»
ident has had to choose not to follow

An Idea Whose Time Has Come:
Disarm Now.

Forfourprincipalreasons, our
nation must proceed toward total
nucleardisarmament: first, justice
in the world order; second, world
security; third, national equity,
and iinaliy, moral probity.

International Justice

Basic international justice
demands disarmament. “One can—
not imagine an international law
that permanently discriminates
between nations. If some states
are allowed to keep nuclear weap—
ons because they claim they are
neededfortheirsecurityonecane
not deny the acquisition of these
weapons to other states" (Ger—
son),

The entire have—mt (no nue
clear weapons) world sees it that
way. The UN has passed a steady
stream of resolutions calling for
the abolition of nuclear weapons
(see last issuE)i beginning with
the very ﬁrst resolution ,of the
General Assembly at the very first
UN Session in 1945, which urged
“the elimination from national ar—
mamentsofatomicweapons."Are

ticle VI of the NPT calls for elim—

rounded Iraq With over 1,000 nu—
clearwarheads. Most recently, Clin-

Yes, nuclear war remains a se-
rious possibility, especially if you
arean“enemy"oftheUnitedStates.

declare the possession or nuclear

weapons illegal under international
law (Nation, 12—27—93).

Global and National Security

Our national security is also
gravely hindered by our possession of
nuclearweapons (of course, national
security is NOT the reason we lteep
them; national prosperity is, as seen
in the “Nuclear Extortion” article).
The CIA explains the “nuclear clu "
as three—tiered: the five nuclear pow-
ers (US, France, Britain, China, Russ
sia), the undeclared powers (Faki—
stan, lndia, Israel), and the develop

ing nations (North Korea, Iraq, lran, ,

Libya, and Algeria).

interestingly, all or the possible .

and certain nuclear powers which
have any antipathy toward the Unitr
ed States have called for the total
elimination or nuclear Weapons. in.
die, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea all
argued before the World Court that
nuclear weapons should be ruled ille—
gal These countries are trying to
acquire nuclear weapons out of justiv
{table rear for their own security in

light of us nuclear weapons and us
consist Willingness to use them. ‘

National Equity
« Basic equity at home has also

been eyiscerated by our nLiclear ede -_

diction. Nuclear weapons do protect
the privilege of the transnational—
corporations (as explained in the
“Nuclear Extortion’ article). Thus,
national (military) security absorbs
“almost 50% of our budget in some
formoranother. ..Welfare absorbs two
percent" (LM). Yet its the welfare
mothers and the unemployed who
are blamed for the declining stan—
dard of living. Bill Clinton's budget
will (according to his own predic.
tions) send 1.2 million more chil-
dren into poverty, while giving the
Pentagon $7 billion more than it
requested.

Basic Morality

Finally, possession of nuclear
weapons is simply wrong. “Security
based on the threat of wholesale de—
struction, possibly [omiiicidc]. is
bound to...crode the ethical basis of
ciVilization" (Gerson). Our use and
dependence on nuclear weapons has
spawned,accordiiigto Bostonolobc
columnist James Carroll, “a malig
nancy in the American soul."

The fact that nuclear war con-
tinues to be seriously considered
makes it the crucial issue for our
time. Richard McSorely, S], states
that “Nuclear weapons are the tap»
root ofviolence in our society" (Len
if we can accept the intention of our

government to prepare for and
wage nuclear war, we can accept
anything; all other issues are re-
dundant in the face of the nuclear
option)
Conclusion. Our Response
As US citizens, we havethree

options: terror, denial, or action, .

‘ Some people are forced into the

terror response. Mornlconiusiori,

worry, anxiety, alienation, fear,,

and even suicide are all natural
and human responses to life in a
nuclear state. Most people, how—
ever, "choose" denial, They sim—
ply refuse to believe that there is
apmbletn,nsolution,andperson—

King wams people not to

dhi pleads with humanity to ded»

the only thing more powerfulthan
the world‘s armies is “an idea
whose time has come." The time
is now to disarm.

“Think of it," writes John
Carroll, “The United States
brought the human race to the
edge ofthe abyss, Thinkofwhat it
could mean if...thc United States
could lead humanity...bacl< from
its edge." The rest of the world is
willing to follow the US lead.
This places us, as us citizens, in a
position of particular power and
responsibility. Let us not deny or
reject that responsibility.
