Sports in our Society: Is the PEC big enough?

SCOTT ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

Beginning in Febniary and con.
tiriuing until spring break, nanntn
lctes have a very difficult tune find—
ing playing time in the PEC due to
the largo number of teams that begin
to practice at that time thh the
college‘s fields not being in great
shape this spring, non—athletes arc
having problems fintling space for
outdoor activrtics such as ultimate
frisbec. While the athletic depart»
ment is doing their best to find solu/
tions, these space problems are diffk
cult to solve.

Many teams and clubs need prac—
rice tiine tnsitle the PEC during Feb—
ruary and March so the only open
evening tunes are from 9:45pm to
11:00pm. DirectorofAthlcticsDcc
Fairchild said equipment manager
Roger Bauman is willing to stay and
keep the PEC open till midnight, bur
also reported that most people usual—
ly leave by 11:00pm anyway.

Apparently, students want to use
the prime hours but do not want to
stay late. The courts were often
crowded from 9:45pm until about
10:30pm, though it is drffrculi to say
ifstudents leave because they don't
want to use the PEC late at night or
simply because the PEC closes at
11:00pm.

The PEC is usually empty dur»
ing the day, so students can also use
it then Because students have class«
as during the day, though, it is often
difficult to have time to work out or
arrange for people to get together for
games.

have a chance to grow. The East

alternative, though some groups, such
as those playing soccer, have contin—
ued to play on Mac Field.

Changes are always being made
to keep Orinnell’s athletic facilities
up todate. Two new stationarybicy»
cles have been installed in the FEC.
The athletic department and SGA
have also begun investigating build~
ingan outdoor basketball court. Cu!»
rently, there appears to be no open
space to build on, as all five of Grirr

heavrly used,

remove the rocks next to the court
and replace the net so it is usable.
However, it is unlikely that this would
be done until the next budget year.

Future plans do include a corn—
plcte renovation and expansion of
the PEC. Faitchlld hopes to take the
weight room and racquetball courts
out so there is space for six tennis
courts inside the main area. Then a
weight room and an auxiliary gym
could be added south of the building.
The new weight room would be as
tall and open as the rest of the PEC,
but a track would be added around

Jeff Root placed second in the pole
