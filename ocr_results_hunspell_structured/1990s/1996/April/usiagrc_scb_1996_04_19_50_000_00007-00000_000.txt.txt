I Remember

BY JEAN STOKIN

I too grieve
I grieve for the victims

ofthe Oklahoma City bombing

My teats are real,
the weight on my chest heavy

Yet multiply this by 100 more bombs.
maybe thousands,

And glimpse what we did in just one day
of the Gulf War
to day care centers
and hospitals

200,000 persons dead by bombs
and their aftermath

Women and Children

Reporters were banned
pictures forbidden
they learned from Vietnam that
body bags each night
on the TV news
stir up the US public
so we only saw fireworks
and played clean stealth computer
games
Iraqi children are children too.
Who are the terrorists?

It calls to mind the space shuttle accident
a teacher died
a nation mourned
and I grieved too.

But I had just been to El Salvador
and met teachers who were tortured
not by accident, but by design
tens of thousands of them
and workers, catechists, Jesuits,
children killed
by a military to whom we gave more than
one million dollars every day

And I stood in a home in Corral de Piedra
ten days after it was bombed

They were still scraping from the walls
parts ofchildien's brains,
embedded ileep from the force

And I saw a tuft ofhair on the floor
and in the yard, bullet casings
made in lllinOis And I ask:

\X/ho are the terioristsl

And «El Salvador was bad,
in Ouarcmala, a genocide;
200,000 indigenous people killed
since a 1954 ClAbaokr-d coup to help
united Fruit keep land
that peasants needed

And in the early 8054440 villages
wiped arithe map in 3 years

the ways of torture and terror at SOA. an [LASO] to
look at the list, it is a disgusting truth that mass murdec
ers are trained on us soil to slaughter theirown popula—
tions. This blood is on our hands.

A congressman now threatened wrth expulsion
because he revealed classiﬁed information
That the US funded this military for years,
until the secret got out last month.
And who funded the death squads in Haiti?
And in Vietnam, US mines left there are
still exploding, tearing children apart.

How long will we relegate “terrorism"
to acts of a few individuals
not nations, who wage war,

And if we want to concern ourselves
with terrorist prevention

Why do we focus only on fancy
security devices, tighter boarders,
more FBI intervention, instead of

An examination ofconscience.

What about our infiltration of borders
foreign policies to protect
US business interests
at the expense or Third World poor
who die in silence
from hunger, or as victims of
hunger, repression, and war

How long will we deny the blood
on out hands.7 the self-centered
plundering ofall the resources
we can get——
for us alone
at any cost.

Why are we surprised that
terrorism has hit home.7

Well, what has it been like living
in Iraq, or El Salvador, or Guatemala7
for those who are poori for children?

Hiroshima citi-
what did that look like
with every building destroyed
children burned alive, vaporized
and then Nagasaki
and we can't even take the first step
And say. we are sorry.

Imagine. the Oklahoma city bombing multiplied every
day, otricially sanctioned by your own government, paid
tor by the behemoth to the North. These are all human
beings with families, hope, dreams, livcs much as our
own. Truly, Latin America is a “horror show." as Chom—
sky calls it, In Panama, l-londuras, El Salvador, Colon
bra, and throughout the region, between 1987 and 1994,
the us delivered $1.2 billion in weapons. The. blood or
Latin America's poor is on our hands as us citizens.

SLAUGHTERING THE POOR

General Maxwell Taylor said,
35 years ago: “As the leading ‘have'
power, we may have to expect to
fight..,against envious ‘have—nots.”’
In the event that the dominating
classes in the developing countries
eitherneed more assistanceordecide
to try to disobey the ir corporate mas<
ters, the US maintains a vast con—
ventional and nuclear military com-
plex which will sap more than $414
billion dollars from US coffers this
year (includes DOE, Veterans, etc).
The DOD represents 40% of global
military expenditures. With our al.
lies, we account for 80%. Our DOD
budget is larger than that ofthe next
six lilghestespending nations com.
bined and is six times the combined
total of our six major “adversaries"

The us maintains more than
100 overseas bases in lo dtrrcranr
countries. The us now has more
than 200,000 troops in the Gulf,
where we could never get troops be

Lorde’s Sisteroursider, onLibya, the
latest issue of Covert Action Quar—

Iraq, Ramsey Clark's The Fire this
Time; onSomalia, Chomsky’s World
Orders Old and New, and on Haiti,
World Orders Old and New, or the
October 1994 Nation articles byAlan
Nairn. It is sobering to note that the
itday bombing in Grenada caused

more per capita casualties than the
US sustained in all of WWll.

Ofcourse, the US retains (and
is prepared to exercise) the option of
nucleararmihilarion,asdiscussedtwo
weeks ago. For a study ofUS nuclear
extortion policy, please see Joseph
Gerson’s With Hiroshima Eyes.
