Ayin That Liberalism is an Utter
Failure

In this year's State ofthe Union
speech, Bill Clinton made the com»
mentthatthe economy is “the health-
iest it's been in three decades " Now,
,1 know, I know— we should not
take rhe president seriously wlienew
er his lips are moVing, but I find this
quote exceptionally funny,

In last week’s article I expound
ed on why the eighties were nothing
like the media pictured them as be—
ing. Well, this time we get to see the
flip side of that decadei Liberalism
in mOHOn.

After some of the greatest tax
hikes in ourhistory, after the greatest
increase in government regulation,
after some ofthe greatest injections
or liberalism into our ﬁscal policy to
date, what happened? Answer: Fail<
tire.

In 1992, Clinton won the pres»
idcncy, with a little help from Ross
Perot, by attacking the economy
brought about by the twelve years of
republican leadership. prompting the
catch phrase. “It‘s the economy, stii»
pitl ” Clinton called “pathetic" the
economy of I992, which grew by 3.7
percent Anyone blue to knou how
much the economy grew this past
year? Maybe someone could guess
from Clintons quote in the state of
the union speech that it grew maybe
8percent orso to make it better than
Reagan's economy. or course, a rd.
tinnal person taking into account
that the source was a politician may
allow for the obligatory hyperbole
and reduce this guess to 6. Taking
into account that this is an election
yearmaylowerthisto,say,Spercent.
Ahhh, but then the Clinton factor
kicks in. Knowing that this is Clin—
ton talking would change the ratio—
nal guess from 5 percenr to, 1 don't
know, >74 percent or so. Luckily, it
wasn‘t that bad. Clinton, with his
great brilliance, managed to do about
a third as well as Bush‘s “pathetic“
economy. The growth from last
fourth quarter to this fourth quarter
was 1.3 percent.

Let's see ifI can put this into
perspective. On an IQ test, a 75 is
ptettypathetic,so Clintongetsabout
a so. In bowling, a 40 is pretty
pathetic, so Clinton would get about
a 15. Wow! Can I be on his team at
the next tournament?

The average family brings home
$800 less rliisyear than in 1992 (Are
you better offnow than you were”),
and the sad thing is the medias tep—
tesentation ofthe truth. These latest
statistics were buried by The Wash
iiipton Post in a single paragraph far

from the front. The media is doing
everything it can not to allow the
people of America to see how bad
Clintonomics can be

I have blamed Clinton for these
results because his policies are the
reasons why this has happened, but
the guilt, or essence thereof. goes far
deeper. The reason Clinton's econ/
omy has failed is not that Clinton is
acharacterless,waffling,power-hun—
gry criminal. but rather that the Kale»
als in which he believes (or at least
the ideals which would cause his pol»
iCies, I doubt “ideals" and Clinton
should ever validly go inro the same
sentence Without some sort of nega<
riveoperator)simplydonotwork. It
isn't that liberalism actively tries to
hurt the economy, and therefore peo—
ple, but simply that it cannot stop
itselffroindoingso Liberalism, at its
roots, blunts capltaltsm. lt erodes
from our society the bedrock ofotit
success. it removes responsibiliiy
from the people, and it makes us
dependent on Big Brother govern
ment. Germany‘s economy, “hich
Clinton has as his model, forces its
Citizens to pay solnetlllng on the or.
tier of (>0 or 70 percent of their iir
come baclt to the g0\ ernmeni as tas
wow, now that sounds lite a para.
disc to me By the nay, if you look at
the ﬁgures (mm the German ccnno.
niy you may ii oniler why Clinton has
picked itasliis model (Hint, he said
he didn’t inhale, and when Cltnlnn
says something .)

I am an idtilist at heart, and
idealism permeates my every pore,
but I know that this an exception
among humans This is why 1 give
practical reasons nhy ( fiscal) constr.
vatism is the antidote for our na-
tion's woes, Liberals cannot support
their claims with facts because the
real facts do not show them to be
right. They cannot support their
claims with idealism because liberal-
ism, first and foremost. is an effort to
solve supposed (read imagined) woes
created by an idealistically sound
economic policy. In reality, it is a
movement created and fomented by
politicians feeding on class warfare
and class envy. People think that
capitalism allows the unsuccessful to
beoppressed,wheninrealitycapital—
ism allows such great erticiency in
production that even the poor live in
relative abundance (the government
pays money to farmers my; to pro-
duce food, since it is in such great
supply) People, as a rule, do not
starve in capitalistic countries; in
stead they see other people become
super successful, at which time they
begin to complain that they have
been cheated by the society that al.
lowed them to subsist in poverty in
the first place Funny thing, Caplmh
ism: the successful are not limited by
the government, and the poor do not
die forlack offnod and water. Sounds
like oppression to me,
