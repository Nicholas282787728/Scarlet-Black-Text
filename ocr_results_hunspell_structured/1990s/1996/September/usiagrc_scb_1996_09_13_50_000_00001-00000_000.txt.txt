News in Brief
Grinncll falls
in USN&VVR

Griniiell slipped two spots on this year‘s us. News
& World Report ranking of the best national liberal
arts colleges, Grinnell has been ranked since 1985
when the magazine began the “America’s Best Cole
leges" listing. Grinnell, ranked 9th in academic repur
tation according to the survey ofcollege presidents,
deans and admission ofﬁcers, is ranked 16th overall
among 160 highly selective institutions considered
for the list.The College was ranked 14th overall last
yeah

The overall ranking is based on statistical data and
on an exclusive survey of college presidents, deans
and admission officers, regarding academic reputa-
lions.

Grinncll ranks second in the magazine’s “Best Val-
ties" category. According to Us. News, best value
rankings were devised to provide a realistic mea-
sure of where students can get the best education for
the money, The survey ranks schools by evaluating
the quality of the educational program in relation to
its cost after average finanmalraid awards. Only
schools that ﬁnished in the top half of the quality
rankings of national universities and liberal arts col-
leges were considered as potential best values, ac-
cording to US. News.

In its 10th annual “America’s Best Colleges" is-
sue, U.S. News also ranks the nation‘s colleges and
universities by how much debt their students incur
by the time they graduate. U,S. News ranks the
schools whose 1995 graduates incurred the most and
least debt. Grinnell College is ranked 17th on US.
News “least debt" list, and U.S. New: reports an av-
erage debt of $10,100 per student. “Only about 50
percent of Grinnell students have any debt when
they graduate," Ferguson says.

U.S. New: data are based only on graduates who
borrowed from one or more of the following sources:
federal, state and local governments; ﬁnancial insti-
tutions, and the colleges themselves, Because schools
cannot easily track borrowing by parents or others
on behalf of students, those loans are not included,

Wall Street Journal
writers Visit campus

Newton, IA subject of economic study

By ANDY BROOKS
Editor-in»Chief

Wall Street Journal writers David
Wessel and Bob Davis visited Grinnell
College this week to discuss their re—
search on Newton, IA for a forthcoming
book. The book, inspired by two articles
for the Journal written by Mr. Wessel
and Mr. Davis, compared 1920’s indus
trial growth to 1990’s technological
growth,

The book explores “what the 20th cen-
tury tells us about the let century. We‘ re
looking at the question of whether the
economy can grow faster and whether
rewards will be divided more equally,"
said Mr. Davis,

Mr. Davis explained that the selection
of Newton for the initial articles pub-
lished in the Wall Street Journal was
made due to Maytag Corporation’s lo-
cation there. “Because of Maytag, every-
one knew what it was...it was a good
example and we could get the stuff we
needed," said Mr. Davis, The writers
considered focusing on Findlay, Ohio,
home of the Whirlpool Corporation, but

Newton was chosen due to the town‘s
daily newspaper's extensive index and
cooperation. The decision to use a small
town with a large durable goods produc-
tion plant was influenced by Mr.
Wessel‘s experience reporting on the
appliance industry at the Wall Street
Journal.

From the Newton Daily News‘s index
and interviews with Newton residents
living in the 1920’s, Mr. Wessel discovr
cred examples of small town business
and political dynamics. “Mr. Fred
Maytag ran for mayor in 1920 because
he wanted to fix the electricalproblem,”
said Mr. Wessel.

Besides its exposure in the Wall Street
Journal, Newton has drawn national at-
tention for its reported crack problem and
Maytag Corporation’s employee educa
tion programs. Maytag’s new highrtech
corporateawide training center, operated
with the Des Moincs Area Community
College, expands professional and tech
nical training opportunities for employr
ees.

tightens

copyright restrictions

By TOM TAYLOR
Reporter

The appearance of various collections
of xeroxed documents bearing the title
Course Packet Grinnell College in the
bookstore at the beginning of Spring se-
mester of last year was a source of con-
fusion and frustration to many students
and marked the end ofan era at Grinnell.
One immediately sensed that gone were
the freewheeling, reckless days when proV
fessors simply compiled their own an
thologies at the nearest photocopier and
then distributed them to students over the
course of the semester, satisﬁed in the
knowledge that they were doing their part
to help keep information free,

The change, however, was bound to
come. The college had never established
an official copyright policy and, follow-
ing the revision ofthe U,S. CopyrightAct
in 1976, had been allowing professors to
operate in abeyance of the amended law,
which attached a new statutory status to
the over one hundred year old common
law doctrine of “fair use.“ The fair use
provisions of the 1976 law were intended
to provide educators with a workable set
of guidelines for copying the work of oth-

ers (in all media).

However, since the enactment of the law,
interpretation of what constitutes “fair
use” of a copied document, sound record
ing or video has led to much confusion
among educators at all levels and has pro
vided publishing houses seekin g royalties
in copyright infringement suis with a new
weapon. However, itwasn'tuntil a group
of publishing houses won a federal dis-
trict court ruling in New York in atitillat-
ing case involving NYU students, Kinko’s
and Albert Camus that colleges around the
country began to establish comprehensive
copyrightpolicies for their professors and
students in order to shield themselves
from law suits by greedy authors and pub»
lishing eonsortiums,

Grinnell, isolated’as it is from the sora
did affairs of the outside world, was not
burdened with a copyright policy until last
year, when the administration and its law-
yers began to feel that it was only a mat-
ter of time before the college was selected
for persecution by an author or publish-
ing house. The official Grinnell policy,

adapted from a policy implemented at

Wellesley in 1993, contains within it an

Alice Kloker spent the summer in Mexico workingfor Food First.

 

Klokcr speaks on

Chiapas experience.
Unique opportunity offers insights

By MICHELE HOST
Staff Writer

The concept of revolution for most col
lege students usually remains just that; a
dry classroom concept which is never
actually put into practice, But Grinnell
senior Alice Kloker actually integrated
Marx’s idea of pram into her life when
she spent much of her summer.working
on behalf of the Zapatista Army of Na
tional Liberation. Her ideological com
mitment culminated in two weeks spent
in Chiapas, Mexico, as a delegate at “The
Intercontinental Encounter for Humanity
and against Neoliberalism."

Kloker‘sjob assignment this summer was
at Food First, a nonproﬁt organization
focused on the right to food and food-pro-
ducing resources located in Berkeley, Cali-
fornia. She was assigned to the Mexico
program, Where she researched agricul-
tural reform policies. Kloker had spent the
fall of 1995 in Mexico, and her assignment
zit Food First heightened her intern! in the

country and the Chiapas revolution.

The revolution in Chiapas officially be-
gan on January 1, 1994, with the ratiﬁca-
tion on NAFTA, even though members of
the Zapatista army had been organizing as

New student data released

Class size grows, applicant pool shrinks

By KATE KLEINWORTH
Staff Writer

The class of 2000, one of the largest in
recent years, has arrived, resulting in more
upperclassmen than usual being allowed
to live off»campus.

This entering class consists of 355 ﬁrst—
year students and 34 transfers; roughly
60% are female, 40% male. There are 13
AfncanrAmericans, 29Asian-Amei‘icans,
18 Latinos, and 28 intemational students.
Many students come from the Midwest,
but the number of ﬁrst-years from Cali-
fornia, Colorado, and New York in-

creased. However, the composition of this
class is fairly consistent with the rest of
the student body.

Although the entering class is slightly
larger than it has been the past two years.
it still does not exceed the target size set
by the administration, according to
Connie Newport from the Ofﬁce of En-
rollment.

“We eriVe to maintain an average on-
campus enrollment of 12501260 each so»

Popularity of Grille results in overcrowding
Students change dining habits with new board policies

By MELINDA JONES
Staff Writer

This semester Quad and Cowles aren't
the only places boasting long lines of
hungry students waiting for a meal. The
Forum Grille, traditionally a place where
students have met to grab a snack or do
homework, is suddenly rivaling the cam»
pus dining halls for mealtime popularity.
This change is due for the most part to
several added board options, allowing
students to choose a meal plan that fea-
tures a designated amount of credit to-
wards Forum Grille food in addition to
their allotted amount ofdining hall meals
per week.

The Forum Grille offers a diverse menu
for both meals and snacks. Pizza (whole
or by the slice), deli sandwiches, high
quality soups and bagels are offered to
satiate students‘ appetites at lunch and
dinner, while various bakery items, can-
dies and fmits are available for those sim-
ply interested in grabbing a quick bite to
eat. In addition to these choices, several

.‘i- ed'.’

Lines in the Forum have lengthened due to the
Grille and a change in the student board options.

new features have been added to thc
Grille's menu, such as grilled cheese and
fried egg sandwiches.

Although the majority of the Grille's dine
ing choices are the same as they have been
in previous years, this semester marks the

first time Grinnell students have fully utir
lized these options at mealtimes Forum
Grille Supervisor Mary Kirk |S excited
and optimistic about the sudden boost in
populaiity, “I figured it (the change made
to the meal plans) would be successful,

but I wasn’t sure Just how busy we would
be," she said, I
In fact, the success has been so great that
it has prompted the Grille to increase their
number of student staff members from 16
to 27. With this new increase of business,
however, comes a handful of new mom
cerns. Kirk lists one of those problems as
limited supplies. The Grille only has a lim»
iled amount ofspace and supplies to work
with, and when unexpectedly large
amounts of students file into the Forum
for lunch, not only does the seating area
fill up fast, but certain food items tend to
sell out quickly. Along with that problem
comes Kirk’s concern that “people may
feel like they’re not getting the quick ser—
vice they’re used to getting.“ Whereas in
previous years students were able to sim—
ply order an item and promptly be served,
now longer lines and the occasional lack
of certain menu items may interfere with
that standard. Kirk feels that this will come
to happen once the staff becomes better
able to predict and work with the amount
ofstudents dining at the Grille,
