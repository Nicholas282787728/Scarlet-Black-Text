Students elect new SGA senators
Candidates seek to “serve needs” of campus

By DAVID REED
Reporter

On Tuesday, September 10, elecr
[ions were held for the position of
Hall Senator to represent each in-
dividual hall at the Student Gov-
ernment Association Joint Board
meetings. The Senator can then
vote in the interest of the hall
when issues come up at the meet—
ings.

James Rechs, the SGA Adminis-
trative Coordinator and chair of
the Election Board, said, “it would
make me happy to see a lot of
people run." If no one runs for
election in a hall, Rechs said, he
has to go to the hall and find some
body, He is always interested in

ates, and the number of students who
are on academic or personal leave,"
Newport said. “The college’s target
enrollment target for entering stu7
dents this fall was 380-

390 students and we enrolled 389.”

Despite the larger size, the number
of applicants was about 2% lower
than the previous year. However, for
the ﬁfth year in a row, the college
received over 2,000 applications.
Similar numbers of applications are
expected in the future.

Grinnell was not the only college
with a large freshmen class this year.
According to Newport, “our indicar
tion during the summer was that
many schools expected to meet their
target enrollments or exceed them
slightly,"

Perhaps the most important result
of this large class size is that more
juniors than usual are being allowed
to live off-campus. Because Grinnell
is a residential campus, only a small
number of students are allowed off-
campus each year. Preference is
given to seniors, students over age
22, andlhose with children. Juniors

ideas for ways to get people more
involved. One of those new ideas
was to implement elections over
e-mail for the off-campus college
owned and non-college owned
housing. Students in college
owned housmg are able to elect
two Senators to SGA Joint Board
alld students in non-college owned
housing are able to elect three

When asked why she ran, Brook
Bailey ‘98, candidate for Rawson,
said she wanted to, “better serve
the needs and concerns ofthe cam—
pus . . .[it was} essential to uphold
ing the ideals of selfgovcrnment."

Rechs was impressed.

Nick Larma ‘99, candidate for
Gates, said, “1 am running to keep
in touch with what is going on
around campus, in a place as mul-
tifacctcd as Grinncll, 1 don't want
people who think the same way as
me to go unheard and unvoiced."

Now that the elections are over,
Rcchs, “strongly encourages",
people to contact their Senators
personally. “They‘re very nice
people." Rechs also wanted to
emphasize that you don‘t have to
be a Senator to go to the jomt
board meetings. Even though at-
tending students cannot vote on
the issues in front of the Joint
Board, they can participate in the
discussion and could have influr
ence on the outcome of the vote.

The new Senators are:

must enter a lottery for remaining
spaces.

At the end of last year, there were
morejuniors wanting to live off cam-
pus thén spaces available. Due to the
large enrollment, though, more spaces
in the dorms needed to be made avai1~
able for the freshmen. So over the
summer, the number of students al»
lowed off-campus increased from 165
to 180 and ﬁnally to 21 6. Those origi-
nally denied off-campus housing were

contacted and all siuderlLs who wished
to leave campus were allowed to do
so.

Another change in housing to ac»
commodate tile freshmen was the
conversion of several double rooms
into triples. There are 28 triples this
yeah

Director of Housing Oda Calllson
converted several large doubles, such
as in Rawson or Gates. “1 had to go
back and change some things before

room draws, so there would be more
adequate rooms to triple," Callison said.

Callison did not have to go to great
lengths this year to find rooms for all
the new students. Three years ago the
entering class was much larger, and
drastic measures had to be mken.

“It transformed the campus and took
me completely by surpn'se," Callison
said. “I’ve never had a class like that
before. I converted FDR’s, lounges,
everything into rooms."

the sense that, to the students of
Grinnell, the course packets were
yet another costly injustice im~
posed upon them by an enemy
who was maddentngly absent.
This semester, students were
observed organizing an appropri-

ate form of protest against the
new state of affairs but, after
having spent an hour on line and
hundreds of dollars on books,
most simply stumbled back to
their dorms or apartments with
their big, white bags.

court.

The recent decision overturned
an earlier ruling against a man
who was ordered to pay a large
settlement to three publishing
houses in 1992 for using his
three copy shops to assemble un-
authorized course packets for
students at the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor. The
court ruled that his actions actu-
ally were in accordance with the
fair use guidelines established in
1976.

The ruling is being appealed
but perhaps an important prece—
dent has been set. If the admin-
istration ever feels confident
enough to alter or throw out its
copyright policy, students can
look forward to a day when the
hateful course packets will no
longer crowd the shelves of the
bookstore and professors can
once again distribute warm,
freshly xeroxed and unautho»
rized documents to their stu-
dents.

a political entity for ten years be
fore that time. Kloker says that
”The Chiapas rebellion is essen-
tially about the historical struggle
for land that has been talking place
since the Revolution and has been
heightened by the liberalization of
agricultural resources.”

Kloker emphasizes that the
Zapatistas are not currently using
violence. In fact, she says that
“they're talking and using dialogue,
which is a model I think we can all
emulate." The Zapatislas “are
about returning community control
where it has been eroded by Core
porate control."

Food First has played an active
role in the Chiapas rebellion “since
its inception,"
according to Kloker. because ofthe
agricultural nature ofthe Zapatista
objective. Her work at Food First
prompted her to join the Comité
Emiliano Zapata, which works on
behalf of the Zapatislas in the
United States through grassroots
education about the nature of
neoliberalism. Kloker's personal
odyssey to Chiapas was connected
to her Comité activities, for she at—
tended the conference as a mem—
ber of the Bay Area Comite Del-
egation.

Actually being in Chiapas with
4,000 other activists from around
the world “was intense and over-
whelming" for Kloker. This jourr
ney afforded her the unique opporr
tunity to visit communities of [6*

ous year. For the same period, the
company posted a net loss of $20.5
million, Maytag has become an in-
dustry leader in producing energy-
efflcient kitchen and home appli-
ances, and in modifying its produc-
tion processes to beneﬁt the envi-
ronmenl,

The journalists' Sesquicentennial
talk on Monday evening, titled
“Why the American Middle Class
Will Do Better Over the Next 20
Years: Lessons from Newton,
Iowa," paralleled the 1920’s emer-
gence ofeleciric motors used in pro-
duction at Maytag with recent dcr
velopments in computer technology.

“We spend all this money on com-
puterstut see no increase in pro-
ductivity,“ said Mr. Wessel. They
concluded that the mtroduciton of
computers to the workplace has not
caused amarked increase in produc-

tivity because the introduction of
computers was an “uncommon
switch," but that their project illus—
trates that “computers are llkc ally
other technology." In their book on
the Maytag the writers plan to exp
plain the impact or computers on
production in Newton.

Mr. Wesscl and Mr. Davis gathr
ered contextual information by in-
terviewing residents who worked
at Maytag in the 1920‘s. Mr. Wessel
recalled interviewing a former
Maytag employee who had “two
hearing aids and he still couldn‘t
hear, so we hatl to hold tip a sign
with questions " Both journalists
agreed, ”people in Newton were re-
ally nice."

Concerning tlle academic content
of their articles, Mr. Wesscl said,
“people don't want to read an are
tlcle that's academic, so you have
to sneak it in " Mr. Davis and Mr,

achieve despite their meager re-
sources. According io Kloker, the,
mere existence ofthese communities
“shows what can happen when
people share a common vision."

The commonality of the Zapatista
vision became especially vivid for
Kloker on the ﬁrst night of the con-
ference, when one ofthe revolution»
aries was describing the Zapatista use
of face masks and discussed “those
ofus who are disappeared and those
of us who have no face.” In this dis-
cussioll of the invisibility of indig-
enous peoples. the Zapatistas in—
cluded not only the economically
disadvantaged of the world, but gays
and lesbians as well. For Kloker, this
inclusion was very meaningful be.
cause revolutionnarles rarely em.
brace the gay and lesbian community
as a part of their vision.

Kloker calls the international press
coverage ofthe Zapatista revolution
“terrible and distorlivc" because the
press “focuses on pictures of Oliver

' Stone wearing a ski mask on a horse

but gives very little focus to politi-
cal prisoners or the peace process."
But she encourages Grinnellians to
follow events in Chiapas for several
reasons. Social justice concerns in
Chiapas need to be monitored, and,
according to Kloker, “what’s happen-
ing to the Mexican economy is ex-
tremely related to what’s happening
in the American economy." Also,
Kloker claims that citizens should be
outraged because United States tax
dollars sent to the Mexican govern-
ment for “the war on drugs" are be-
ing used to wage war on the
Zapatistas.

Wesscl. who started working at the
Wall Street Journal in 1982 and
1984, respectively, were approached
by an agent who saw their articles
about Newton as material for a per
tential book

The warm welcome received by the
journalists in Newton was extended
to their welcome ill Grinncll, The
large audience at Monday‘s talk in-
cliidcd Maytag's chief executives
and Newton residents. Roger
Ratcliff, a former Social Studies
teacher at Newton High School,
commented that hc appreciated
Wessel and Davis's positive perspec-
tive on Newton's future, Ratcliff
said, “why not take tlle optimistic
point or view?"

Although a title for the book has not
yet been agreed upon, Wesscl and
Davis are considering “Chapge of
Fortune.”
