plenty of fascinating special effectsr

where he becomes a player. This is
more exciting than rhe PeopleMov—

Jaws

Sreyen Spielberg was 27 when
he directed jaws, which has gone on
to become one of the highest grossr

been terrorizing the coast. jaws is a
cleversend—lipofMobyDrck.substi—

elements ofgteal acting, suspenseful
directing, a truly frightening script,
ancl an appropriarely creepy score by
John Williams.

Little Odessa follows in the well»

adds an urgently fresh touch to the
