Odor found to emanate from Chief Alpha

By DUSTIN KEY
Staff Writer

The Grinnell College community
may have noticed a strange smell in
the air from which there seems to be
no escape. The occurrence of the
odor is hard to predict. Sometimes
it shoots through campus for a brief
second, not to be detected for another
month, sometimes landing on cam»
pus. not to leave for a whole week.
Many detest the scent, and label it as
a Sickeningly-sweet odor or worse.
Others say that “it’s Just Iowa."
Speculation as to what it is and where
it comes from ranges for and wide,
along with theories concerningjust
when the smell will arise. The odor
has probably been here since 1953,
depends on the Wind, can occur at
any time during the year and is the
result of the alfalfa processing of
ChiefAlfa Inc.

At ﬁrst glance, ChiefAllea lnc.

dozen silos, a few warehouses, semi

The Clil‘efAlpha plant is constantly processing alfalfa.

 

ize you are standing within the belly
of an elaborate automation, fully
equipped with all the buttons and
gadgets our seeiety has learned to
admire.

And in an office which overlooks
the Dehydrator you will find James
Lang. who has operated Chief Al»
pha Inc., with sons Ray and Jerry,
since 1953. He explained the alfalfa
process from beginning to end.
ChicfAlplla Inc. is one ofonly two
establishments to perform the fol-

lowing process in all of Iowa.
Every 35 days. alfalfa is cut by a
self propelled machine, After this,
other machines pick up the fallen al-
falfa and chop it into smaller strands.
At this point the alfalfa is driven to a
storage bin near the Dehydrator.
Some of the alfalfa IS rolled into
bales, to be processed in the winter.
The rest is immediately dehydrated.
Before dehydration, the alfalfa is
wet The sun could be used to dry it,
but this would take tllree days and

quality is not the best when sun»
dried. Therefore, the Dchydrator has
been created to dry out the alfalfa in
halfzt ininutc. Alfalfa is loaded into
the Dehydrator where it progresses
through the cylinder. pulled by a 100
HP fan at one end and pushed by
natural gas generated flames on the
other. The alfalfa exits retaining only
8% ofits original moisture. Inciden-
tally, this evaporation process mani-
fests itself in the sweet odor which
can be detected on the campus when
the wind is right,

At this stage the alfalfa is Sllll hot
and in its original, hayrlikc form.
Just as the alfalfa exits the Dehydrar
tor, it enters a machine and is pul-
verized, to be then compressed into
dense pellets. The pellets are cooled.
weighed, and then stored in one of
the bins which range from 501) to
1,000 tons in capacity. Each day, all
year, 50 tons of alfalfa is processed
into pellets.

Chief Alpha’s main competition
resides mainly in Nebraska and Kane

sas. Thus it is advantageous to send

the pellets to eastern markets, gain»
ing advantage over the alfalfa pro-
cessors further west which must pay
for extended trucking. Indeed, Lang
said that business is ﬁne and that this
year's weather has been favorable.

Professor Gordon stresses the im-
ponance ofuniting Grinnell Produc-
tions with the community ofGrinnell
as a Whole: "This project is about
building a partnership With commu-
nity and all its aspects, whether it be
economic. architectural develop»
ment, or programming for youth."

In keeping with this goal of com-
munity involvement, Grinnell Pro-
ductions will be conducting the Iowa
High School Drama Workshop in
August of 1997. This will be a six-
day workshop for high school thes-

 

pians from all over the state of Iowa,
involving playwritlng. scenework,
and acting. Grinnell Productions will
also be offering historical walking
tours of the playhouse buildings on
October 12 and 13 every half hour
from 1:00 to 4:30 pm.

Grinnell Productions will be hold»
ing auditions for the musical “Fid»
dler on the Real" on Saturday, N07

The location of the auditions is yet
to be determined. The play will be
produced over Winter Break, and all
interested are invited to audition.

The community has been very sup-

First-year student Sally Graver.
who has helped organize the
dreamcatcher making, described her
expectations ofAlice as “lots of fun

ﬁrst-year student, agreed. Both ex

Only with 100% of the student

will deliver a reading of his work.
The Series will end on November 19
with discussions and readings by Li—
Young Lee and Sharon Olds. Lee
won the Lamont Poetry Prize in 1990
and Olds received the National Book
Critics Award in 1985.

Hirsch remembers his yearning
while a Grinnell student to have cre-
ative Writers around at all times. and
this was a motivation in designing
the Series and workshop. Hirsch
feels loyal to Grinnell and has re-
turned many times to lecture and
teach. He was most recently here last
January for the Sesquicentennial In-
terim Session to teach a course on
the creative process in the ans. Many
Grinncll students who took this
three»day course recall it fondly, with
one student referring to Hirsch as an
“inspirational person, poet and
teacher." Hirsch hopes this Series
will lead to more Wrilers’ Series in
the years to come for the Grinnell
Community.

is important to also note that a sig-
nificant number of new students
chose NOT to self»identify their

Construction business to be expanded

By KATE KLEINWORTH
Staff Writer

Life LeGeios ‘97 and Halley
Wheeless‘97 are ill the midst of to
search this year in hopes ofexptilltlr
ing a company they began in Rock
Springs, Wyoming

Working to Lenin Enterprises
started in June 1995. A ctiiitlncting
company, they do construction.

home improvement, painting, and

roofing.

The idea for this business was born
when Wheeless and LeGeros were
looking for work one summer.

”We were looking for some work,
and We couldn't ﬁnd anything de-
cent," Wheeless said. “Thcll we [Cr
allzed it was stupid working for other
people when we had the skills we
needed to work for ourselves."

Doing construction work was not
a new experience for either founder
of Working to Learn Enterprises.
Halley Wheeless. whose fatllcr was
a contractor, grew up with it.

Despite past experiences. Lchros
and Wheeless ran into difficulties
when they formed their company.

“We didn't know a lOl oi little
things," LeGeros said. “Like how
ﬁrst to advertise, how to approach a
customer. We didn't have materials
or equipment. There were intricacies
like collecting a bill. We had to play
it by ear. it was a learning process."

To solve the problems related to
starting a business, LeGeros and
Wheeless turned to West Slater, the
Wyoming businessman who inspired
the new company. With his help,
Working to Leatii Enterprises was
soon under Way.

Although it is a constiuction coni-
pany now, LeGeros and Wheeless
plan to move it ill a different dilcc-
tion after they graduate. They are

iii the 21st century by looking at
schools in countries around the
world. They have already sent packs
ets of inftlmtalion with Grinnell stun
dents studying abroad,

“Right now we’re a construction
company, but in ﬁve years we could
be an educational consulting firm,”
cheros said. "But either way, we
have experience coordinating and or»
gtiilizmg and dealing with people."

For Lchros and Wheeless, one of
the best things about being self-em-
ploycd is the freedom. They set their
own hours and are responsible for
their own Work. However, they are
also responsible when things go
wrong.

"Your integrity is on the line,"
LcGeros explained. “We‘ve worked
25 hour shifts a we'd never do that
for someone else. When the customer
is impressed, they’re impressed with
us. Then when it isn’t well, you feel
like a total failure. Not being able to
get work done is sometimes out of
your control, but you blame your-
self."

Being able to take pride in your
own accomplishments is a deﬁnite
advantage of working for yourself,
according to Wheeless. Last summer,
they painted the Chamber of Com-
merce in Rock Springs.

"It was great to have people look
tit ii and say ‘yeah, We did that’ and
be proud of it," Wheeless said.

LcGeros also sees benefits in be»
ginning the company now as opposed
waiting until after they graduate.

“It’s much better to make our mis-
takes now than later after we gradu-
ate," Lchtos said. “We will do this
somehow in the future. When we get
out of school, we will be making le»
gitimatc money, and can pay back
loans it’ll be more than just purely
surviving. We know enough to be
successful now,"
