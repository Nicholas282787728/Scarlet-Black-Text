“White Awareness”

To the Editor:

In three years at Otinnell I have
never felt the burning desire needed
to type a letter to the editor (even
when I was crucified for slandering
the Sociology department). The
White Awareness presentation has
provided such an impetus. My dis.
taste for the state ofrace relations at
orinnell has been growing in the
past year. and l have surpassed my
point of tolerance 'there are two
things I would like to address, first, a
sentence in the statement in the
White Awareness letter to the catn—
pus community, and second, while
Awareness in and of itself.

At one point in the letter/pen.
tion submitted by those participat-
mg in the White Awareness presen.
tation to the 8&B, the signatories
promise to support the demands for
space matle by the organizations of
ASIA and SOL. This worries me, as
ignorant advocacy of anything, re—
gardless of merit, may have detrir
mental effects to the cause itself. I
have severe doubts as to the knowl—
edge the signatories have ofthe situ.
anon surround mg the move for space
on the part of these two organizer
tions. While 1 Will admit my igno-
rance of the issue in the context of
SOL, I would like to articulate that
there are those within ASIA. iiiclutlr
ing myself, who see ihc possibility of
ASIA gaining separate space as p0<
tentially disastrous ASIA for the
last three years has folloned exclu—
sionary practices de facto Not all
Asians (whether titey be American
or foreign born) feel welcome within
rlieorganizarion whilemajnrstrides
have been made in making the orga.
nization more inclusive, the costs
that these aticmpis liiiie had to the
organi-arion itsell'haie been enur.
inous ASIA is in a period of transl»
tion. Separate space carries iiirh it
iliepossibilityoiASIAiovtriingback
to an institution ofexclusion within
the Asian community at Grinnell
We have our own inteinal problems
to sort out, and it would be a terrible
act of hypocrisy to make demands
upon the campus at large before we
can solve those conflicts that plague
our organization Currently.

(While reviewing this letter, a
member of SOL has expressed their
dissatisfaction with my opinion. I
must, therefore, add that this is an
experience I can only claim valid in
the context of ASIA and may not

apply ro orhcr organisations Nor
shotild this in any way be seen as a
condemnation ofthe demand forsep-
arare space.)

Finally, 1, Unfortunately, have
cultivated a cynical attitude while

\X/hite Awareness prcscniation has
raised questions in my oivn mind
signatories seem to have articulared
a desire to assist miilrtcultural orga»
mentions in their growth and accepr
tance, and further a desire to learn
about the diverse erhniciries that
inhabit this campus, However, not—
ing that :in Asian minisymposiurn
has come and gone, how many ofthe
signatories retained the compassion
they ariesred to a week earlier and
joined us in learning about Asian.
American issues and culture: I dare
say that i observed a minute few, and
those ivhire facesthatattendedwhom
I recognised had all avoided the
White Awareness meeting with ve—
hemcnce. Conventional wisdom
seems to dictate that everyone must
speak of racial harmony- and under
standing, however, i do not believe
that speech directly translates into
action, and action is what the pe«
riphory of our society (and our col.
lege) desperately needs.

Litteting on Campus
To Lhe Grinnell College community:

I am asecorid semester freshman
andl have a problem with something
that I view as a hypocrisy of the
student body and community in gen—
etal, With ihr melting of the snow
recently, the grounds of the campus

that is strewn about. And in my
mind, here hes the hypocrisy, as the
concerned student body that we are,
shouldn’t we concern DLlrSClVCS willi
all the crap that is on the ground7 I
am personally fed up with it On the
average walk from my room in Dib—
hie to the classrooms, l passcigarerte
butts. leaﬂets, and wrappers along

so apathetic that we just throw bccr
bottles on the ground rather than
throwing them into their proper re<
cepraclei i mean, how hard is it to
put a can or bottle mm one of the
recycling bins around campus: Espe.
cially ifwe as a student body suppos.
etlly care so much about the world

passes a piece oftrash on the ground,
how hard is it to pick it up and throw

beenenvironinentallyneglectfuldoes
not mean you can‘t be conscientious
and pick up the mess.

We go to school in a beautiful
setting; it is a shame to see such a
finedookmgplace marred by laziness
and slovenliness. I hate to sound

cliche’d, but we should all iiist pitch
in: think before you toss a candy
wrapper on the ground, and if yer.

feel better about yourselffor it.

New Community Voices
To the campus community:

After you return from spring
Break, you will be receiving the first
issue of Community Voices, a dia«
logue sheet distributed to students
and faculty. Its purpose will be to
provide a space to continue dialogue
concerning issues of multnculturah
ism,“race,"anddiversityontheGrin<
nell campirs and beyond, and to cel—
ebrate the cultures and diversity
found iii the Grinnell Community.

Grinnell needs CVforanumbcr
of reasons: a) Lets face it: just be.
cause someone steps onto Orinnell
campus does not mean that they are
suddenly “eiiligliteiied"about living
in a diverse Community. Part of
living in a healthy diverse environ—
ment involves sharing experiences
and concerns in order to create mu—
tual understandings, b) The “politi—
cally correct" envnonment at Orin«
nell often stifles genuine dialogue
and keeps people from furthering
their awareness of what it means to
live in a multicultural setting In
other words, the fear of “saying the
wrong thing" leads to silence. which
only perpetuates inistinderstandinn,
c) \ irhout a regular forum, the
needs and concerns of students can
only be expressed through protests
and other, similar events. Protests
have resulted in concrete changes
and positive action. However, as
may be evident. they are not a long
term solution for combating igno<
rarice and misunderstanding.

New students arm-e every year;
the protests of prev-lous years mean
little to them, In addition, those
who do not feel comfortable speak
mg in public do not get their voices
heard. Those who need time to for»
mtilnte their thoughts do not gut a
chance to respond

Unlike this “Letters to the Edi»
tot”colulnli, Coiiiruuuiry Voicesac—
cepts anonymous entries, in whatev-
er roiinat you chose to use. It you

The Acts of Cowards

To the campus communi

In the last few weeks, orinnell
College has been inundated with an
amasing mass of propaganda by our
fellow college students who have
decided to run for the prestigious
offices in the SGA, I've had plenty
of rime to read rheir statements of
intent, they are in all the bathrooms
and hallways and I feel that I made
the best dec ion for myself and my
community when I voted.

Now. the day after the initial
election, one day before the runoff,
scandal has hit us, Suddenly, instead
orstudentpropagandasupportingour
classrmates. there seems to be aseries
ofnegative signs being put up against
some of the candidates. I feel that
these actions are a disgusting display
or preyudice and hatred, as well as a
key indication thatthe outside polit»
ical climate has truly effected this
year's campaigns.

Why is it that we, as a student
body. have to be exposed to such
intid.slingingdrivcli 1r isasmappto—
priaie as harassing an individual sex—
ually. as iii-an g as assaulting a person
physically. is this the kind of envi<
ronincni rhar Grlnnell college is
becoming? I Certainly hope not,

i came here as a first—year ex<
peering a place ii here many different
individuals come together and form
a community. one that supports and
respects its members, in light oirliis
display. as nell as the vocalization of
other minoriry groups on campus, I
realize that that feeling olcommuni.
ty, for some, is ,usr a myth it is e
whispered dream of hippies, a hope
of those who aren’t here simply be—
cause rhe educarion that we receive
is excellent, it seems to be an ideal
rhar cannot be achieved.

Honestly, I did not know about
the signs, as they did not make it
down to South Campus Does this
say something about our living situr
attons? Does this create yet another

dichotomy betweenNorthand South
living.7 i believe it does. To those
individuals responsible for the dis
gusting displays of ignorance, I offer
this up: you must really fearthe inter»
nationalstudents,you mustfeartheir
differences and frames ofexpetience,
for these are the acts of cowards.

A Concerned International
Students Organization

To the Editor:

The slanderous fliers that were
posted around campusdid not mluri.
ate us as international students so
much as worry us We are an otgani»
ration that constantly reminds ev—
eryone on this campus about the part
ofthe Grinnell Collegestudent body
who come from different cultures
worldwtde. As supporters for a mul»
ttcultural enVironment at this col—
lege, we believe in the sharing of
diiterent cultural backgrounds
through friendly and responsible in»
teractions between the Intel-nation»
a1 students and the rest of thestudent
body. By responsible, we mean re—
spect for each other's differences and
understanding of each other‘s cir—
cumstances, The amount of bias and
ignorance that was revealed by an
Indi\'Idual(s) through those ridicu—
lous fliers is a matter which concerns
us clearly, Therefore. the 150 cabi—
net would like to meet with this
group who call themselves “The Fair
and Free group.” Even then, it is
unlikely that this group which com-
mitted such cowardly acts will be
brave enough to speak to us in per-
son, so we will not ask for such a
meeting However, to the truly “fair
and free” rest of the student body, we
politely ask you to be informed and
aware of any such blind prejudices
that exist in our school. Please help
tis make this place an ignorance—free
campus. Thank you very much
