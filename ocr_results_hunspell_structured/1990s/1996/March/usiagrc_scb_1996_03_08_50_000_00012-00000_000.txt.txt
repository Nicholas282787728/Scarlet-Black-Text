Radical Chic

setting out to comfort the afflicted
and aﬂlict the comfortable

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

Well,I've beenback oncainpus
for six weeks now (after SIX years
away), and I’ve metso many mtetesle
ingnew people. ”Howdidyousctew
up your knee” is a frequent and In<
nocent question. “Running in ptis<
on," I answer slyly, looking for a
response. My prison and jail expeth
ences seem to intrigue people I
guess it’s something different from
experiences most Grinnellians have
or expect to have i wonder how
many other Orinnell alums are “ca—
reercriminals"intheeyesoftheU,S.
government.

I have been arrested about 30
times and have spent more than 22
months in jails and prisons, includ«
ing my last stay of 14 months. I have
been convicted of 3 felonies and
around 8 misdemeanors. Two of the
felonies were for the same “offense,"
All of my attests have been for cml
disobedience against the wanmat.
ing state

When I was asked by a friend to
write about jail, I thought up a bunch
of valid angles, I could do a long
article on why I think it is important
that people do ClVll disobedience
against weapons and war. 1 could
talk about how “in an unjust society,
the only place for a just person is in
prison" (Thoreau), or about how
important it is to experience prison if
one intends to do work in the inner
city. in this article, since i have [0
nartow my discussion, I would like to
discussjail ingeneral, and the lessons
I have learned inside.

I saw a cartoon depicting two
boxes. In the left box, a police officer
tells an inmate, “In here. your life
becomes so impoverished. violent,
and hopelessthatyou willthinktwice
about a life ofctime." The right box
portrays a lite of urban squalor, drug
wars, and prison—like tenements For
so many, this cartoon is reality an
and urban destitution become a vi<
cious cycle.

For the past ten years, I have
been cultivating friendships with
folks in shelters and soup lines. I left
Grinnell six years ago to live with
“homeless” families full time and to
spend more time in soup ititchens
and on the streets of BC. On the
comet where I live, I witness beat»
ings, fistfights, drug traffic, and p0»
lice Violence. Insoup lines, the trus.
tration, destitution, and Violence
intensify. In jail, it is even worse.

There are more than 1.5 million
people in us. prisons and jails right
now. 70% ofthese ate rot nonviolent
offenses. 1 wonder how many of
these people will come out of jail

The fact that some people do
succeed in staying "clean" upon re»
lease is a powetftil testimony to the
natural nonviolent goodness of hu»
man beings. Generally, people
emerge from jail broken. alienated,
despairing. angry, and armed with a
greater proficiency in the ways of
Violence and hate. Nothing in iail
attempts to help people, because the
jail indiistrialcomplcx isbig business
With big PACs, and they don’t find
rehabilitation profitable. Also, as
long as the populations are largely
people of color, we can all look the
other way andpretend it doesn’t con—
cern us.

Indeed, one unavoidable obser~
vatitin in prison is that there are a
disproportionate number of people
ofcolor. Thestatistics are particular
lydaunttng~e.g. recentstudiesshow
that onethird of young black men
are presently in nu, onprcbaticn, or
on parole. African-American men
make tip 6% ofour national popula
tion, but 44% ofinrtiates (and41% of
death tow), Either people ol color
are inherently criminal (the view of
the Charles Muttays nfthe world), or
we have adeep racism in this country
which disenfranchises people of col—
or.

In fact, stud ies show that pover—
tycausesvtolonce:violenceandctime
are caused by slashing social pto—
grams. defunding health care <St edu—
cation, and apolicy on the part ofthe
federal reserve of keeping 8 million
Americans unemployed, The catch
is that people ofcolot in outcountty
ate tcpt poor by design. In 1993,
unemployment for African/ﬁnen-
cans was three times that of Euro«
Americans, household wealth was
less than one<tenth, and poverty was
33%highcr. Studyiiponstudyproves
overt racism against qualified Afri—
can-American applicants for jobs,
loans, and housing Racism fuels
poverty which fuels Violence

Of course, racism also dictates
that poor blacks get hit harder in the
"war on drugs." The adversary in this
war is not the CIA not the NSC
which manipulate drug traffic for
“national security,” not the US ,
based pharmaceuticals which ptot
duce the processing chemicals for
cocaine, not the banks in Florida
which launderdrugprofits, Neithe
adversaries are the us, poor, espc.
cially the young black poor.
According to a study done last Fall,
blacks constitute 13% of drug users,

e.g.

35% otdrug possession arrests, 55%
of convictions, and 74% of prison
sentences. And sentencing, too, is
mindblowingly most. with people
of color consistently receiving sen—
tences 40.60% longer than whites
with identical charges and criminal
histories. Of course, the nation
doesn't care, Clinton figures he has
the black vote in his pocket, so he
plays the race card free and easy.

Thus we (ind that the only ade—
quately funded piagrams fot poor
peopleareprisonsandcombat. Clin.
ton's crime bill spends 23 billion tlol—
lats. half for ptisonsl Now in his
State ofthe Union, he calls for “one
strike and you're out " Clinton’s diug
budget puts 70% of its funds into law
enforcement, while more than 90%
of drug rehab applicants are turned
away fot lack atspace. And in the
most overtly (and mind—numbingly)
racist act on the part of any President
since Dwight Eisenhower, Clinton
recommended and argued (against
the advice of his own sentenctng
commission) to keep crack sentenc—
es at 100 times powder cocaine sen—
tences. This is the same dnig, but
crack convictiom fall on whites just
4.1% of the time.

Walter Wink contentls that “indif—

ference to ordinary people carries
with it a shaming effect- it makes
them feelinsignificant. Forlife is not
just an encounter between human
beings, but a struggle to the death for
recognition ,Acts of indifference

my decision to live and be friends

I assure him that he doesn't either,
but that we're in the same boat now.
He appreciates my point His spirit

amazes me every time, Most of my
jail friends come from poverty and
believe they can't break the cycle.
that they are worthless.

“Drug not" policy is marked by
Vindictlveness. Poverty is ignored
andcrimespeciniislyanalysed When
given any recognition at all, the poor
are portrayed as l and dishonest;
criminals and drug users are vilified,
stripped ottheir humanity Poor or
convict (which is the exact same
thing with 85% offelonies), you do
serve your rate, you brought it on
yourself

The problems atviolencc and
racism require not programs for pun.
ishment, but empathy. An exploiti-
tion of policy options would take a
full book. And it doesn't matter,
because both the Democrats and the
Republicans are committed to a tac—
ist and classist (but politicallyprofit»
able) plan which satistics the prison
industries and the right wing. \Ve
must address the issue in our lives,
not waiting for politicians to catch
tip.

In our lives, we must reach out
to society’s poor and outcast, We
must build triendships with the poor,
treat those ctlmlnallzed by society
with love and compassion. We must
not judge, but should love and ac—
cept. We have a choice in out lives.
We can follow the pack in the way of
consumption and self—interest, for—
getting that there is a large mass of
the global (and even domestic) pop»
ulation which is suffering; or we can
embrace the struggle for a nonvio<
lent world of compassion for the
whole cteation, Martin LutherKing

pcorand disenfranchised, rather than

Grinnell graduates, we are already
most of the way to the latter catego—
ry. It will take real choices to move
from the tanks of the privileged to
solidarity with the mass of people
who do not have first-world college
degrees,

Eugene Debs said that "where
there is a lower class, I am in it; where
there isacrimtnalelement, I am ofit;
and where there is a soul in prison, I
am not free.” I am very happy with
my decisions thus far. [ recommend
ClVil disobedience and jail time as
worthwhile and important experi»
ences. I truly believe that the polit»
ical climate warrants an intense and
total response, and that nothing puts
one's lifcontlie line like ciVildisobe
