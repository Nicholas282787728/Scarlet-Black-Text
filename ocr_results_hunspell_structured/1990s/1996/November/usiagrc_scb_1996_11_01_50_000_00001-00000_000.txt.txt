A.S.I.A. decries “advertisement”

A mock ad in the GUM has polarized the campus regarding the deﬁnition of racism

By DUSTIN KEY
Staff Writer

A mock advertisement which appeared
in the October 15 issue of Grinnell
College‘s GUM Magazine has provoked
Asian Students in Alliance (ASIA) to de-
mand the “immediate resignations” ofthe
GUM’S co-editors. Dan Buettner ‘97 and
Marcus Moran ‘99.

The ‘advertisement’ included a photo
graph of ASIA’s Spring 1996 protest on
Mac Field. in which the group demon—
strated their desire for increased space
resources on campus. One of the signs
used in the protest was blanked out in the
photo, replaced with the phrase “Your
cause here.“ Below the photo, in the text
of the ‘ad,' the ASIA acronym was used
to stand for “Asinine Student Initiative
Assistance," The text continued, “If you
have a ludicrous cause which you need
help promoting, call ASIA."

On the morning following the GUM’s
publication, over a dozen signs put out
by ASIA appeared across campus. Each

contained a copy ofthe ‘ad‘ with the word
“racxst” written over it. The signs called
for supportive students to write their name
“all over the page."

Caroline Chon ‘98, spokesperson for
ASIA, said “the ﬁrst reaction [to the ad]
when I showed people or talked to people
was shock. They couldn't even believe
that someone would do this,”

The F arum: Racism Addressed

Thursday afternoon, October 17, a f0—
rum was held at which students offended
by the advertisement gave speeches eXr
plainin g why they felt the ad had been
hurtful. Many of the central issues of the
controversy surfaced at this point.

The general accusation against the ‘ad’
was that it was covertly racist. Many of
those who spoke believed that through the
use of the ASIA acronym and the photo
of the Spring ‘96 protest by ASIA, the cre-
ators of the ‘ad‘ belittled the struggles of
Asians/Asian—Americans.

The GUM editors were then asked why
the ‘ad’ had used ASIAas its specific sub-
ject matter. The editors replied that the

Seminar spurs grading debate

Professors discuss ways

By DAVID BURNETT
Staff Writer

Recently there have been rumors
around campus that several Grinnell pro-
fessors are actively advocating the elimi-
nation of a grading system. The rumors
originated earlier this semester when
grading policies were discussed at a semi-
nar for professors.Although grading was
a topic for discussion, Professor Kent
McClelland ofthe Sociology Department
said that there is currently no professor
movement to abolish the grading system
at Grinnell. ‘

Earlier this semester, the college spon-
sored its first»ever weekend teaching
seminar. The purpose ofthe seminar was
to allow professors to discuss and explore
methods of improving education. The
topic of this ﬁrst seminar was the book
Punished by Reward: by Alfie Kohn. In
the writing, the author analyzes the ben-
eﬁts and limitations of incentive plans. At
the seminar, Kohn's writing served as the
basis for discussion. Although the book
did spur debate about the de-emphasis of
grades, the professors at the seminar never
made an attempt to abolish the grading
system at Grinnell. Mr. McClelland. who
helped organize the meeting, said, “The
elimination of grades was a topic for dis-
cussion at the seminar. but not the gen-
eral sentiment."

According to Mr. McClelland. there are
professors at Grinnell that believe grad-
ing can sometimes be detrimental to the

to improve education
learning process. The focus of this semi-
nar was to discuss methods of improving
grading systems so future professor evalu-
ations of students can be more beneﬁcial
and helpful to those being graded.

On the topic of the elimination of
grades, Mr. McClelland also said. “There
may be professors who favor this ap-
proach, but it is not currently on the table.
Almost all the discussion about grading
at the seminar was focused on how indi-
vidual professors grade, not on the
College‘s grading policies."

Although the new weekend teaching
seminars are not attempting to change the
grading process at Grinnell, they are try—
ing to help professors improve their meth—
ods of teaching. Future seminars will con-
tinue to focus on the discussion ofa conr
troversial book about education and to
promote the exchange of education imr
proving ideas among professors. Twentye
ﬁve members ofthe Grinnell faculty parr
ticipated in the first discussion. "The good
attendance at the firstseminar shows that
Grinnell professors care enough to work
on improving education." said Mr.
McClelland.

The next teaching seminar will be held
in the spring on the book Teaching to
Tranrgress by Bell Hooks. Like the ﬁrst
seminar, the topic deals with methods of
improving the education process by
changing present procedures. Currently.
twenty—one faculty members are signed
up to participate in Grinnell’s second
weekend teaching seminar.

picture had been more readily available
to them than photos showing other groups.
Buettner said that he resented being called
a racist. “I feel that ‘racist’ is avery pow-
erful Word and has a lot to do with intent.
The ad was not intended as a racial slurs“

Speciﬁc experiences and viewpoints
dealing with racism varied within ASIA’s
members; however there were points of
consensus. Chon said “Generally we all
agree that the ad was racist. Some people
might not have agreed with that in the
beginning. Through discussions there
was aconsensus. [think everybody feels
it was highly offensive."

Kesho Scott. Associate Professor of
American Studies and Sociology, said,
“the issue ofintent, to me, is about being
sensitive to the struggles of people who
have been traditional minorities. That ad
is racist because it is insensitive."

Buettnerpountered that racism is “be-
lieving any group of people is inferior to
another. The ad wasn‘t made because I
believe anyone is inferior.”

A more tentative conclusion to the

question of racism was drawn by Chen
Zhao ‘97, a member ofASIA. who said, “
I have doubts whether the ad was racist, . .
simply because I don’t know a good deﬁ-
nition in today's society that can really
What describe racism is. Racism today is
different than what it was twenty or thirty
years ago. Racism is very subtle, very dif-
ﬁcult to pinpoint."

Intent vs. Ignorance

At the forum the editors expressed that
the purpose of their ad had been “to poke
fun at the hyperactivity of campus protest."
Both stated that they offered no apology
for this intent in and of itself. but did say
that the speciﬁc use of the acronym and
the photograph was a mistake since they
had no intent to single out aspeciiic group
on campus.

Immediately after the forum Buettner
said, “I wanted to poke some fun at the
nature of the demonstrations which were
put on last spring by student groups here
on campus. My intent was not to single
out ASIA, but I realize that has been the

Endowment continues to grow
Rising market leads to heavy coffers

By DUSTIN KEY
Staff Writer

Over the years Grinnell’s endowment
has attracted national attention through
such publications as US. News and World
Report, Fortune, and Forbes. Since 1980.
when the endowment was approximately
$47 million it has grown in real value
more than seven fold. This year was no
exception in the saga of the wild growth
of the endowment.

According to David Clay, Chief Trea-
surer of Grinnell College, the Standard
and Poor 500 market index was up 26%
last year from previous years. As Grinnell
has many holdings in the market, this was
very good for the campus. In fact,
Grinnell’s endowment increased by nearly

one hundred million dollars, or by ap
proximately 23.8%. The total amount in
Grinnell’s coffers is now $571.5 million
at market value. Mr. Clay said, “It’s pretty
well known that the college’s long term
performance is amongst the best in higher
education. We've consistently been in the
top ten institutions." Mr. Clay also said
that our school has the second or third
highest percentage of endowment being
used to pay for annual operating costs.
Of course the market is subject to in-
stability and the college wishes to protect
itself from ﬂuctuation. The college ﬁr
nances roughly 35% to 40% of its annual
costs with the endowment. The spending
policy is to take a three year moving av-
erage of the endowment‘s market value

students face Tuesday elections

Lake and Carroll vie for a seat represent
ing Grinnell and surrounding communi-
ties in the Iowa House. Lake‘s projected
success rating was recently upgraded by
the state level Democratic Party; Carroll’s
incumbency “gives him.an obvious ad-
vantage"sa1d Dustin Key ‘97, an avid ob-
server ofpolitics. Carroll emphasizes his
record of tax cuts in campaign literature,

and was labeled a “Friend of Agriculture" '

by the Iowa Farm Bureau. Lake’s cam-
paign material focuses on public school
funding and lighter environmental codes
for corporate hog farms,

In the contest for a seat in Washington’s
House representing Grinnell and the rest
of the 3rd Congressional district, Davis
City Democrat Leonard Boswell and
former Iowa Republican Party chiefMike
Mahaffey of Montezuma were engaged
in a remarkably friendly race until re-
cently. The Boswell and Mahaffey con-
test received national attention several
weeks ago when theAssociated Press said
its “positive tenor" marked a shift to con-
genial politics in Iowa. But last week the
campaign lost its innocence when a new
Mahaffey television spot soiled the air
waves. The new Mahaffey advertisement
accuses Boswell of being a “tool" of the
“liberal special interests." The ad features
many adornments ofstandard attack tele-
vision such as a grainy black and white
photo of Boswell, an ominous announcer
and redrletlered warnings. Boswell Came

Mahaffey Campaign Manager Will
Lynch reacted to Boswell’s disappoint—
ment by notingthat thecommercials were
being run by the National Republican
Congressional Committee, not the
Mahaffey campaign; although Mahaffey
could have asked that the ads not be run,

Predictions based on previous presi-
dential election turnouts forecast that
about 650 Grinnell College students will
vote on the local ballot. Perhaps unaware
of their power in a small town election,

students seem to forget about the legislar
tive positions that are up for grabs. Stroll-
ing the loggia, looking in vain for signs of
political lift: on the windows and doors of
dormitories, a wandering pollster might
conclude that the students of Grinnell have
moved beyond the realm ofpolitical opin-
ion to a state of apathy.

When asked where they got the
majority oftheir political information, the
randomly selected respondents answered
with a number of different sources. Thor
