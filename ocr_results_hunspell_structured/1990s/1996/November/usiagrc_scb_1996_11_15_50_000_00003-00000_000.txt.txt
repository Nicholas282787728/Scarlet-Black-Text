Beware of the Furry Creatures

Roving reporter uncovers rodent conspiracy
. /

BY TOM TAYLOR
Reporter

Walking to class a few days ago.
my path was blocked by an ex-
tremely int squirrel holding an acorn
between his paws

He was sitting on his linunches in
the middle of the path. staring me
down as I approached him, 1 ﬁnally
stopped a few feet in front of him, a
little disturbed. Perhaps 1 bad cnr
countered a rabid squirrel. He held
my gaze for a few moments and then
put the acorn in his mouth and
bounded casually away.

It was a strange experience be
cause squirrels are usually
so timid. This little guy,
however, seemed to be de»
minding my attention, aslf
to say “Hey, look atme, I'm
a squirrel!" 0r “Alleml And where
do you think you're going?" in
maybe something funny.

Anyway, 1 had llever given much
thought to the hundredsndare I say
thousandswot‘squilrcls that live their
lives in our midst Upon i-ciloction.
however, I began to realize that the
squirrels ot Grinncll constitute a VCllr
table second college. The aces and
open spaces between Gill and 10111
streets are their campus and tllclr in-
stitution is called Squirrel U.. so day
ignated because it is composed of
squirrels.

I know how dangerous it is to an-
tliropomorphlze animals too much,
especially rodents. but I think that
anyone willing to conduct the nec-
essary research would ﬁnd that squir-
rels are not the dullards we think they
are.

It would require great cunning to
gain their confidence, perhaps an

pretend we don‘t see these squirrels
plnying lrisbcc, smoking miniature
cigarettes, chewing on peoples‘
shoes? It‘s an outrage!

I also want to know what they're
doing with all those acorns and why
1've ncvci seen ti dend squirrel on
campus. Perhaps what we’re deal-
ing with is something a lot more for-
midable than real squirrels, i

I’m talking aboout advanced plas-
tics, computer chips, fake fur. or
coulsc the government denies all
knowledge and that's to be expected.
Just watch yourself the next time a
squirrel crosses your path. You could
be in a lot more danger than you re

New Initiatives at a Glance

BY ERIN CHILDRESS
ACE Programmer

It‘s a relatively sllnple process
you write an initiative (i.e.. “We, the
students ofCrlnncll College believe
that”); the ACE committee reviews
it to insurcclarlty and correct gram»
mar: you collect 200 signatures to
get it on the ballot: the Sam prints
it: students VOIC on it. lt‘thc major
ity of students voting approve it, it
becomes an officml studcnl lnitlar
live. So what?

Last May, students voted on
eight lnltlattves. ranging train a
declaration against the college’s use
of prison labor products to a pmr
posal to move the pass/faildeadllne
and convert back to the original
pass/rail system. Over one-fourth
ofthe campus voted. The initiatives
passed. Still, so what7

The problem with the initiatives
system in the recent past has been
the lack of Vision and understand-
ing concerning what to do wrth
them irthey pass, The SGA pylons
leave the process open for interpre-
tatlon, simply stating that “upon
passage of an initiative, the ACE
Programmer shall be responsible
for reporting in writing the results
ofthe vote and the approved ill a7
tive to the appropriate parties.“ Like
any sound constitutional clause. this
section allows each ACE Progi'anlr

lucn‘t binding to cacll author, but
they will scivc several useful pur-
poses First. a plan 01' action shows
that not only is an initiative worth
approval. bill that it also feasible.

will prm'ldc a starting point for ac-
tinu ll'an initiativc passes, Every plan
cl action could cntl up looking ex-

is that each will be tailored to the par-
ticiilni problem, giving direction and
possibly lcsponslblllty to both ad-
ininistrtittiis and students after vol»
ing ends ml December 6.

The point is, though, that initia-
[Ives need more meaning, As 1200
lather precocious students attend
Uilnncll. it seems logical that not
only should students articulate their
opinions and dcsn'cs, but that they
should liavc the opportunity to par-
ticlpntc ill the tcsolution process too.
