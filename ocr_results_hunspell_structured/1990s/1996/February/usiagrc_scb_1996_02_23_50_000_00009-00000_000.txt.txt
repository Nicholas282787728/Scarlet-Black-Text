SDAE Campaign
To the campus community:

Friday eveningSDAE, Students
in Defense ofAnimals and the Envi—
ronmcnt, started a poster campaign
to raise awareness about the cruelty
inﬂicted on animals in factory iarrns,

particularly pigs. 50 posters were put
up on South Campus and every one
was rippeddownwithin hoursoithem
being put up. Another so posters
werepurup onNorthcampuswhieh
were ripped down within a day and a
half.

Over the past few years we. as
individuals, have participated in a
numberofcampalgnsoncampusthat
involvedputting uppostersforawide
range ofsocial causes and never have
anyofusseensodeliberateandthor-
ougli a Job ofvandallsm.

It appears that animal rights
challenges people in away that other
issues of justice do not. Challenging
our relationship with animals is ap—
parently frightening enough to some
members of this campus that they
would rip all our posters down or
allow others to do so We can under—
stand the fear, because none ofus was
born sympathetic to the suffering of
anim3157not one. We all are meat
for much of our lives. And we all,
individually, came to question our
beliefs aboutanimalsand rethinkour
relationship with them.

Rethinkingoutrelationshipwith
animals is indeed a scary prospect
because those who research and ex—
plore the issues will realize the depth
of our abuse of animals. We abuse
them terribly, not only in food pro—
duction, but in the clothing we wear,
the tests we run, the entertainment
weenioy,and the researchwe do No
one can address all of these issues at
once. Sometimes it Is tempting to
not change any part ofour life (e,g.,
becomingvegetarian)forfearofhav—
ing to immediately change our lives
even more drastically (e.g., becom«
ing vegan or not buying leather).
However, conscience dictates that
we address what we can, as we can.
Fear of change has never been a just
reason to continue participating in
iniustice.

We credit those who vandalized
ourcampaigniyithsecingl’arenough
to realize that this campaign repre-
sentsadeep challengr toour present
way of life. Much of what we enjoy
depends upon the exploitation of

both human and non— human ani—
mals. we would almost prefer van—
dalisin to the silent and smug dis—
missal of the eliallengr to reevaluate
our relationship With animals.

We harbor no malice toward the
individual/s who did this or who
watched ithappen, Furrhermore,we
invite anyone who has a problem
with our campaign and Wishes to
challenge us to do so. E-mail us at
[SDAE] and we can arrange a time to
discuss our differences. We further
invite anyone Who is interested to
debate us publicly; again, e.rne.il
[SDAE] and we can arrange this.
Discussing and debating are much
more effective and peaceful ways to
express profound moral disagree-
ments than vandalism,

Commentary ' 9

animals die for your choices. our
posters simply present facts.

More to the point, your argu—
ment is the same one used by slave
holders on this continent for 350
years and more recently by wife bear-
ers, child abusers, gay bashers, the
Apartheid government in South Af-
rica, and by all other groups who felt
thatexpoitation andvmlence against
other beings was a question of their
personal morality. Think about it.

Violence is violence. Murder is
murder. Like it or not, we share this
planet with other sentient beings.
Can’t we agree, as a minimal Stan»
dard of morality, not to eat them?

To the campus community:

Excuse me? I was listening to
KDIC and I heard yet another re»
proach of SDAE for trying to con—
vince people to give up eating meat.
The argument goes like this: quit
forcing your personaI morality on
other people.

I wonder how the 8 billion ani—
mals who will suffer grievous pain

about it Meat eaters force their
murderous and hedonistic food choic—

thought. We are asking you to think

As I do not profess to be an
expert on both sides ofthe vegetar'r
an/animal rights debate, I will not
attempt to present a case foreither. I
do have one personal bias on the
issue: I was raised on a beef—cattle
farm and I can assure you that not
every livestock establishment treats
their animals unethically. I would,
however, like to voice my opinion
regarding one other aspect of the
issue.

While I am a proud carnivore, I
have no problem with any person
who chooses a vegetarian or vegan
dier. I do have a problem with being
told by certain vegetarians orvegam,
as I was upon leavmg Cowles dining
hallonWednesday, February 21 , that
Ishould re—evaluare my moral stance
regarding my own diet. In response
to the SDAE representative’s accu—

PEACE

sations, I stated that any person’s
attitude toward the issue is simply
that person‘s opinion; he replied that
it is not, implying that I should ac—
ccpt his moral position as correct. Is
this desire for uniformity ofopinion
consistentwiththe GrinnellCollege
ideal? I think not.

“Simon Says"
To the editor:

As a Grinnell college woman. I
was offended by and disappointed in
Dan Wolfe's cartoon “Simon Says"
that appeared in last week’s SiStB.
First ofaIl, Ididn’tthink itwasfunny
(as all cartoons should be, don’t you
thinkl), but I was also upset when
Simon identified the “divine" Uni“
of a ”goddess” asonly those of beauty,
the likelihood of “running around
scantily clad,” and the small chance
of her being attracted to Simon, the
little first—year.

I was wondering if, a) Dan actu—
ally thoughr that this was funny, and
h) if you thought it was funny enough
to publish it, considering its rather
questionable View of the female stu—
dents on this campus (since the strip
is supposed to be a commentary on
Grinnell life). I thought that the
Grinnell student community would
be above this type of humor, or may—
be I'm just missing all the women
running around In towels bragging
about their love of “steamy showers"
to their male floorn-iatesi Could we
please have another FUNNY Cat—
toon?

Sincerely,
Amanda Hombuckle '97
