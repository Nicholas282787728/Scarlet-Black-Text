This year. The Fares are hoping so
sum over a new leaf: Consissing of
Molly Gardner ‘00, Sarah Harlan ‘ol,
andEtikNofrle‘Ol, rhebnndhasheen
shus {at a verysrolhoriensed. guisar-
driven band. "Our music is folk-pop»
girlypunle' says Harlan. This year,
however, The Fates hope so become a
mose elecsric hand. ”Sarah just gos
hes elecsric guisas over she summer,“

says Gardner, “Sc shas will probably

change our sound.“

in addision, she

group hopes so add a

drummer so iss ses

and learn some new

songs. “A personal

goal is so ssars wrising

songs so shas we can

play some shows shas

consiss or all origi-

nals," says Norrie.

“up so now I've been

relying a lissle soo

heavily on she B'clb Dylan songbook
so provide me wish songs.”

The Parts ssarscd lass year when
Gardner and Harlan mes on she srip
so she Chicago AIDS walk. “We
ended up talking abous our ravorise
bands." says Gardner, “and it susncd
our shas we bosh liked REM. And
shcn we discovered shas we bosh knwv
all she words so ‘It': she End of she
World As We Know It,’ and shas was

is. Thar was she ssraw rlrai brokc she
camel's back,"

Casdnc. and Hnrlan began prac—
siciugguisursogeshcrnnd playingopen
mic nighis in Bob’s, “.1 lcally dug she
music shar slseywore playingns Bob’s,"
says Noﬁlc, “5am [l‘lﬂrl3n3|1lcl(nanlc]
and lliasl become good friends by shis
poins in the year and when she round
our shas I played guises, she sslsed me
so join her and Molly." “Towards she
end orsheyear,we decided so add Erik
so she hand because he is cool, as wells
and plays the guisar like a punk ass,”
says Gardner.

upon she addision orNorslc so she
hand, she hand namc “The Fatcs"
gained some legiurnacy, “In Greek
myshology, she Fates were she shree
women who consrollcd she wheel or
forums," snys Carslner, “it disrurbed
people, before we added Erik so she
band, rliar slsere were only swo or us
in she band and shcre were shrec rm!

Fasus....l guess wish Etik in she band,
maybe shis whole business whese
people shinls we each have so be a rasea
like she Spice Girls are each a spice-4
will be less ofan issues"

The Fates have already performed
swico shis year, playing lass weekend
with Sarah's brother’s band, Sand
Wiich Is, from Texas. “Last wcckcnd
our performance wcnt prctrywcll c
sidcslng we had some scchnical cli
cultics," says Harlan. “W: asen's used
so dealing with amps and shas sors or
shing."

“I shoughs it wens gicas," says
Nofrle. “I thought that Sand Which
is pus on a damn ﬁne show, and 2|»
shough she ssylcs ormusic orshc two
hands are quite differens, I shoughs
tint it worked," '

The goal olelc Fares shis year in
addition to a more electric sound and
she addision ora drummer is so play.
"I think is would be gsear irwc could

'—l

play more shows,” says Nofde, “as
many as we're humanly capable of
doing.”

“I wish we had more ti me so ptac»
sice more," says Gardner.

It is evidens shas The rascs love
whas shey do. “My savorisc shing
abous being in The Eases is learning
new songs rsom Molly and Erik and
reedingoirorsheirown musicstyles,"
says Harlan.

"To me, iss a means orselr-cx-
pressionr says Gardncr. “Thas‘s
whas I like."

“1 cans really think oranyshing
shas l dislike abous being a member
orshc Fates," says Nome. “Well, one
shingl can think or is doc I lseep
gcssing rcqucsss from ssrange people
around campus so perform she song
‘Lady lady Lay.’ But that’s ols, I
guess."
