Spoon swings by
Omaha

Spoon, an Austin-based band, will
play Sokol Hall in Omaha on May
9. The Elektra band originally ap
peared on Matador, along with the
likes of Helium, the Jon Spencer
Blues Explosion, and Liz Phair. The
band has opened for indie greats Yo
La Tengo, Guided by Voices, and
Pavement. Their 1996 release
Telephotto prompted the band to start
performing outside of Texas. Con-
sequently, clubs such as Lounge Ax
in Chicago have seized the opportur
nity to book the band.

Included among the band‘s influ-
ences are Nirvana, PJ Harvey. and
Gang of Four. Says Britt Daniel, lead
guitarist and singer: “I don't really
think we sound like any of those
bands, but ifI ever sit down and think
I want to write a song that sounds
like this, it‘s probably after I listen
to a Wire record."

Trans Am pays a
visit to Gabe’s

Beatmasters Trans Am will host a
show at Gabe's in Iowa City this
Thesday. The three-person band suCr
cessfully alternates between guitar!
bass thrashings and electronic exe
perimentalism. Both of the band‘s
styles connect under their rigid
rhythm control.

Trans Am’s latest release
Surveillanceis their third album. All
three have been released off Thrill
Jockey Records; which Touch and
Go distributes. The band began as a
classic rock cover band, but then
evolved their image with a
soundboard and rifling drum
hammerings.

Visceral “Moon”

combines

tragedy and humor

A small fountain of mist poured
down from the ceiling of the Hallie
Flanagan Studio Theatre in the new
FineArts Center, creatinga light fog
within the room as the sound of a
piping ﬂute could be heard coming
out of the theatre speakers. Green and
yellow lights splashed down from the
ceiling to come together in a myriad
of colors bathing the sturdy set in tile
otherwise darkened room.

“0 Conjur Man, O Conjur Man.
Please do this thing I‘m wantill',
Please change me to a human man,
Fer Barbara I’d be courtin‘ ." So goes
one version of the “The Ballad of
Barbara Allen." And the rest of the
story unfolds, as we learn the story
ofa tragic love between a Witch boy
and a human girl, and their attempt
to make a forbidden love work,

“I was looking for a very theatri-
cal play," to perform in what he be-
lieves to be a very “theatrical and
flexible theatre " entioned Grinnell
Professor *f'rh, trefA‘leéaairdér s:
Moffettfwho direc p 537‘s pro:
duction here at the college. The piece
has a large cast, with “good roles."
as Moffett continued, and is a very
good “actor’s play.” Everyone feels
“engaged and involved in the pro-
duction" he added.

Originally written in 1941 at the
University of Iowa by Howard

Richardson, “Dark ofthe Moon" was
produced at the University Theatre
shortly thereafter, and cventually
reached Broadway in 1945, after be—
ing modified by William Berney,
who is listed as Richardson's co-au-
thor.

Having been translated into mul-
tiple languages and performed in
numerous other locales such as Bera
lin, London, and Tokyo, “Dark ofthe
Moon" has a distinguished history.

However, as Moffett commented,
“it is typically not considered part of
academia," and is usually not taught
in classes discussing historical
American folk plays.

“Genetically it [“Dark of the
Moon"] ﬁts into what are known...as
Carolina folk plays, plays written by
a small group of writers in and
around Chapel Hill in the late 1930's
and 1940's," as Moffett discusses in
the director’s notes from the play.
These plays were often set in the
Smoky Mountains.

Unfortunately, as Moffelt ex»
plained, this genre ofplays was'seri-
ously doomedrwith the development

culture. In our day and age, when we

ficult to realize that when it was writ-
ten," such behavior “was not cliche,"

As we move farther away from
our time, and consequently from the
stereotypes which people believe this
play conveys, Moffett believes that
“in the future, people might view it
as more Shakespearean."

Nonetheless. “Dark ofthe Moon"
is a story containing, as Moffett com-
mented. “a curious mixture ofpoetic
tragedy and cornball comedy." It is
his second time directing the play.
and while the ﬁrst time Mofielt re-
calls calling a lot out and removing
“some of the jarring aspects" of the
play, this time a greater amount has
been left intact.

In this second direction, “I devel-
oped zt greater sense of respect for
the play," he stated.

Although the grand opening ofthe
theatre will not take place until the
entire complex is ﬁnished, this is the
first real production to take place
within the new walls ofthe building.
And it is quite a setting.

The calls of “witch boy...witch
boy" reverberate through the new
theatre as the story continues and the
audience sees the fate of the main
characters pan out.

“The Conjur Woman say I be hu-
man if you be faithful to me for a
year," the character of “John Hu-
man" says to Barbara as he explains
his dilemma to her. In exchange for
being transformed into a human.
Barbara must be faithful to the witch
boy for one year in order for him to
remain human forever. But what
seems to be a simple tradeoff be-
comes complicated as Barbara’s
family and the townspeople begin to
question the background of “John,"
and who, or what, he really is.

“John" remembers the night when
he and Barbara ﬁrst met; how “the
night came up and the moon went
dark." Things seem simple for the
two characters in the beginning.

“You'll miss the moonlight," the
other witches called out to the boy
as he decided to become human.

"Dark of the Moon" takes the
viewer into a world of love, decep<
tion, disbelief, and intrigue, to give
a quick synopsis. Closing with a soft
string ballad and a whispering ﬂute,
the play leaves you much as it came;
in a quiet, dark splendor. In addition
to performances on Wednesday,
Thursday, and tonight, it.is also
showing tomorrow and Sunday
night, in the new Hallie Flanagan
Studio Theatre in the Fine Arts Cenv
ter.

Flurry of campus music

This afternoon a busy weekend of
music will kick off with a Student
Composers' Concert. Consisting of
music composed by 13 Grin. .11 slua
dents and directed by Professor of
Music Jonathan Chenette, the per
formers include “faculty and students
playing in small chamber groups ine
volving voices, piano, guitar, clarir
net, and strings," Chenette stated. In
addition to this aftemoon’s concen,
there is a Javanese Music and Dance
Ensemble performance tomorrow in
the South Lounge at 3. p.m., Then,
on Sunday. the Young, Gifted and
Black (YGB) Gospel Choir will be
performing in concert at 7 pm. in
Herrick Chapel.

Taking place today in the South
Lounge of the Forum from 12 to
1:30, the music in the concert di-
rected by Chenette “ranges across a
broad spectrum of 20th-century mur
sical styles, including experiments
with exotic scales, jazz-inspired
rhythms, IZetone technique. and ato-
nality," as he mentioned.

Concluding with a set of five
pieces, each by a different student
composer, Chenette commented that
the pieces to be played are “based
on texts from the food section of
Gertrude Stein‘s “Tender Buttons" —
a 1914 collection of texts in which
sound is more important than sense.”

An end-of-semester project for the
“Introduction to Composition" class,
the concert should be quite entertain-
ing. and, as Chenette commented,
“audience members are invited to
bring their lunches to South Lounge
for this noon-hour event."

A week of Judaic

appreciation

Chalutzim, Grinnell College‘s
Jewish organization was founded in
the 1970's and is one ofthe most
active groups on campus, serving
both as a religious and a cultural or»
ganization. The week extending from
Monday, April 27 - Monday, May 4
has been deemed the Jewish Cultural
Week for the year 1998, as far as the
Chalutzim organization is concerned.
They plan to celebrate their culture
with much passion and festivity.

There is no national Jewish Cul-
tural Week, but this is an important
event that takes place on most col-
lege campuses around the country.
The Jewish Cultural Week commit-
tee in Grinnell, consisting of Nicho-
las Schapira ‘01, Elisa Kaplan ‘01,
Rachel Kaplan ‘00, MJ Mathsar ‘01

B.H.: There are lots ofcool things
that I could do. Well, as far as imme-
diate goals, I want to get a new tape
deck, I would like to get the walls
painted in the studio. We could have
a mural or something of the sort.
Eventually, I would also like to get a
new board because the current one
is over 25 years old.

K.N.: Do you have any other
sort of changes that you are plan~
uing on making?

B.H.: No majoroverhauls orany-
thing, Just try to keep it running,

K.N.: I notice that you have a
pretty late show.

B.l-l.: Yeah, well, if you want to
be friendly with the FCC, you play
explicit lyrics at night.

K.N.: Do you have any personal
goals as the Station Manager?

B.I-I.: It is a great job to run the
station. Everyone on staff helps run
the station, but when it comes down
to it, I am the last stop.

torically signiﬁcant court centers of
Yogyakarta and Surakarta."

On the Indonesian islands ofJava,
Bali. and Lombok, as is mentioned
in the program information, “one
finds a staggering variety of indiga
enous instrumental ensembles that all
fall under the general designation
Gamelan."

Full of a variety of instruments,
many of which are “xylophone-like
with their keys made from bamboo,
wood or metal (bronze, iron or
brass),'_' Gamelan music is also
known for the magnificent gongs
used to elicit a “sonorous, sustained
tone," as Vetter mentioned.

Interestingly enough, perhaps one
of the major reasons Gamelan mu-
sic differs so much from Western
style is the fact that musicians do not
memorize parts for hundreds of
pieces. Rather, as the program notes
explained, “they learn the technique
and a vocabulary of patterns for a
each instrument, and then how to
apply that knowledge to various
musical situations that regularly oc»
our in performance[s]." For this rea-
son Gamelan performance can be
very “spontaneous, while at the same
time involving almost no improvisae
tion."

Samuel Williams, director of
YGB since January, hopes to provide
the campus with a great performance
this Sunday, as it will be the group’s
ﬁrst full concert since Williams took
tile position ofdireotor,

Believing in the fact that “music
equals joy and passion,“ Williams
mentioned his hope of seeing “a
heightened level of commitment to
the choir‘s purpose...for the theme
chosen" for this Sunday’s concert.
The theme is “I will praise him!",
born out of the desire to “praise God,
and thank him for all of the things
that he has done for us," Williams
explained.

“It has been rewarding so far,"
Williams commented of his Grinnell
experience. “The students have been
most rewarding to work with."

“I hope that the students are very
receptive" to the performance, Will-
iams concluded. “I see a need for a
voice which praises God" under any
circumstance.

Come out to the Forum and enjoy
an hour ofstudent music to get your
weekend started, experience the va-
riety of Javanese Gamelan music and
dancing, and spend some time in
Herrick on Sunday listening to a bit
of gospel music before you get ready
for the last week of classes.

 

and Maggie Shonsey ‘00, as well as
the general Chalutzim core group,
chose this particular time to celebrate
in honor of Israel’s ﬁftieth birthday,
which is on Thursday, April 30.
President and spokesperson of
Chalutzim, Rachel Weiss '98, says
that, “we do celebrate religious holi-
days and in addition, we feel that it
is equally important to celebrate J u-

Lounge. The band is based in New
York and two of its members,
Deborah Strauss and Jeff
Watschauer, will perform Monday.
This will no doubt be an enchanting
experience for most as, according to
Weiss, “It‘s really hard to stay sit-
ting down during a Klezmer concert.
It’s really energetic and spirited and
represents a lot of Jewish soul.“

daism as a culture, This includes mu-
sic, song, dance and food." To com-
memorate Israeli Independence day,
there will be a talk at the Forum cof—
feehouse entitled “Israel: Part,
Present, and Future, ” given by Pro
fessor Michael Rosenthal at around
noon. Then there will be aDance and
Dessert Extravaganza in Younker
Lounge at 7:30 pm. An interesting
aspect of this desert fest is that most
of the recipes are ones that people
have taken from their grandmothers
and learned to make as part of their
culture, Weiss claims that Jewish
Cultural Week is meant to make evi-
dent the diversity that exists within
the Jewish culture itself. Throughout
the week, there will be a variety of
topics discussed ranging from mode
ern day Israeli politics to a Klezmer
concen, which is essentially eastern
European folk music, The latter will
take place on Monday, May 4 and is
an all campus event open to staff,
students and faculty alike. Through
the help of Deborah Erin, Grinnell's
rabbi, two members of the world re»
nowned Klezmer Conservatory Band
have agreed to come and play their
brilliant Klezmer music in South

On Friday, May 1, there will be a
Kabbalat Shabbat Service in Steiner,
which is basically a set of services
intended to welcome the Sabbath.
This will be followed by the Sabbath
dinner, which actually takes place
every Friday in the Chnlutzim
lounge, on Cowles ﬁrst. “We prepare
food ourselves; cooking together and
preparing traditional recipes is really
vital. The dinner is not only a reli-
gious experience in which prayers
are said but a binding together as
well," says Weiss.

Weiss is also very proud of the fact
that there is so much diversity within
Chalutzim. “Some people come from
more conservative, religious bac‘k-
grounds and some people have never
even gone to a synagogue before.
People are suongly connected to the
religion in different ways, whether
through food, music, family or a
combination of all of these." The
Jewish Cultural Week being cel-
ebrated is an expression of how
Chalutzim in Grinnell is a place
where there can be something for
everyone, whether that be a home
cooked meal, a service, a dance or a
scholarly discussion.
