Excuse me but why is this here?

To: Members of the Grinnell community

To those of you returning to Grinneu from sojourn: farther aﬁeld,
welcome back. You are currently noticing that today's edition of the
Scarlet as Black contains two additional pages of newsprint which are
not sell material but rather material focused on the goings on “in
town.” Much of this material is re-printed from editions of'l‘hc
Grlrmell Herald-Register, material about Grinnell College students
volunteering in the community is from 5c Community Relations
Center, SC Department of Public Relations and in future, We hope,
from the students themselves.

Two such pages will be inserted in the 5&3 for the rest or this semese
ter. This material is intended to provide a tiny window on life “in
town," to make members of the college community aware of off
campus events or programs which may be of interest to them, and to
stress that members of the coﬂege community are welcome as
members or the larger community.

Grinnell— and in my vocabulary, that word does not apply only to the
college— is a place of diversity, but our differences can never be
greater than the sum or an that which we hold in common, Our
stories can and do intertwine

Questions, suggestions and comments regarding this initiative are
welcome and should be addressed to: 8&3 Edition, lleraldrkcgistcr
Publishing 00., 17.0. Box 360. Grinneu, IA 5011:.

Lee Beany of Kansas City, Mo, a
onetime Grinnclllan, a drop-in visitor
Tuesday to Around’s ofﬁce, displayed
an amazing recall ofhls childhood days

St and Lee, the youngest child in the
family, was making his ﬁrst trip back to
Grinnell since his family Ieﬁ.

Looking forthc former Grinncll Jun-

discombobulatcd at its transformation
into the Grinncll Community Center
and also the displacement ofthc former
Congregational Church into its present
sell, but remembered the library, the
movie theater on Main Street and the
swcctlrcatsalCunninghamDrugwhlch
he dccided to sample before leaving
town.

Both the college and the town looked
different to him and much larger from
his perspective as a pintvsized member
ofthe Bcatty family.

As it turned out, he performed admin

cuscd on issues of great importance to
the country as it looks ahead to the 2 1 st
century. Judging by the polls that ap-

Americans gave Clinton high marks for
the address. Indeed, the polls even

It’s somehow refreshing that Ameri-

The country has been awash in this
scandal for over a week now. It domi-
natcs front pages and Ihc nightly news.
It‘s spawned countless new Jokes on

they seem able to make the distinction
between what he 5 doing as president
and how he allegedly behaves in pn-

Anyone who expected something
weird to happen on Tuesday night had
to be disappointed. The president gave
