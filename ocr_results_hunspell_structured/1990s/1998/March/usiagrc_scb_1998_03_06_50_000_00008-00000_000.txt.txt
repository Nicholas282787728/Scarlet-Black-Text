Tennis
team plays
first home
match

Sports Information

After three weeks without a
match the Grinnell College men's
tennis team is gearing up for this
weekend’s home openers. The tri-
angular meet pits the Pioneers
against Cornell at 8:30 a.m. and
Wariburg at 4:00 pm. Cornell and
Wartburg play at 12:00 noon.

Although last season Grinnell
downed Cornell, 70, and
Wartburg, 6-1, Coach Andy
Hamilton feels that the Pioneers
will face improved teams this time
around.

“I know Cornell is a better
team," Hamilton said. “Almost
their entire team is returning playe
ers and I expect a challenge from
them. Wartburg lost only one se-
nior so they, too, wrll provide some
competitive matches."

In a typical season the Pioneers
would have already played four
matches but thus far they have
played only, three, beating

“The last couple of weeks we
worked on specific things and I
think we have improved. I look
forward to finally getting another
opportunity to see this young team
in matches,” concluded Hamilton.

individual championships

“It is going to take a whole team
effort for us to do well this week-
en 1," said Grinnell College
women’s track coach Evelyn Frees
man on her squad's chances at the
Midwest Conference indoor track
championships. The Pioneers
travel to Knox for the league event
Friday and Saturday.

In 1997 the trackwomen carved
out a second-place finish behind
Monmouth. The Scots are favored

. to win the title again.

”Our team is more well»
rounded compared to past years,“
noted Freeman. ”However, we do
not have the depth in the distance
events. That has always been our
staple.“

Coach Freeman looks for se,
niors Becca Webel and Amanda
Walker, and sophomore Juliana
Serafini, to vie for individual loop
crowns. Webel and Serafini are
slated in the middle distances,
1000 and 1500, while Walker come
poles in the sprints. 200 and 400,

places," said the coach.

Last weekend the Grinncllians
practiced on the conference facil-
ity at the Knox Invitational, No
team scores were kept but outs
standing performances were pro
duced by some Pioneers

Winning the 4x400 relay was
the highlight ofthe meet for Coach
Freeman. She explained, “We
have more than four runners Who
all run about the same time in the
400 so our relay unit is talented and
deep. Winning the mile relay was

a great way to finish offthe meet."
The quartet of Skye Langs -00,
Fran Lee ‘00, Serafini and Webel
dropped eight seconds off its sea-
sonrbcst time to clock a 4:14.41.
This was done without the team’s
best sprinter, Walker. The 4x200
relay team of Langs, Jessica Heard
‘01, Lee and Sarah Dixon ‘01 fin-
ished fourth. “I’m pleased with my
relays. If Amanda runs on them
this weekend, they’ll be even
stronger," noted Freeman.

Webel and Serafini also had
great results in the 1000 finishing
first and second in 3:11.05 and
3:11.06. Webel also went 1:44.88
to place second in the 600. In the
3000 Sarah Liegl ‘98 ran a season-
best 113486 to place third.

In field events Langs finished
third in the triplejump with a leap
of32‘ 9.75" while Dari Ter‘rebonne
placed fourth in the weight throw
with 37‘ 4.5".

“We have a very short indoor
season and the conference meet is
definitely our focus. I hope all
squad members have their best per-
formances,” said Freeman.

It has been four years since the
Grinncll College men‘s track team
won its first and only Midwest Con-
ference indoor championship in
1994. The Pioneers hope to put an-
other title under their belts this Fri-
day and Saturday at Knox.

“We are not the favorite this week

could Challenge Monmouth," offered
Coach Will Freeman. The Scots

should fare well in Saturday’s meet.

In 1997 the Grinnellians finished
fourth behind Monmouth, Carroll
and Coe. ”We are much better than
last year because we have more
depth. Also, we‘ll have more ath—
letes in more events this spring. We
have filled some holes in the ﬁeld
group," noted Freeman.

Grinnell’s top opportunity for an
individual title should come from
middlerdistanceman Neil Gipson
‘99. Over his first two seasons
Gipson has proven to be one of the
league’s top competitors.
Distancemen Dan Madigan ‘00, Rob
Park ‘01 and John Areni ‘01 should
also vie for crowns. Madigan won
the 3K and 5K events last yearwhile
Park and Areni both proved last fall
in cross country that they are among
the best in the league.

Gipson won the 600 handily in a time

Richard Werner ‘99 and Jeremiah
Garza ‘99 both made the ﬁnals in the

second place and Garza went 6.77
for fourth. ”Some years we don’t
have any sprinters make the ﬁnals
in the 55. This year we have these
two men and Wade Krause and Stan
Banks to ﬁll out a solid group," re
lated Freeman.

The coach pointed to other ath-
letes’ performances as good signs.
Garza leaped 21'65" inches to fin-
ish fourth in the long jump, Josh
Magden ‘99 placed fifth in the
weight throw and Mark Trocinski
‘99 was 11min the shot. “With some
improvement this week these men
could be factors," noted Freeman.

“I feel good about our chances.
If everything goes well, we have an
outside shot, but unseating
Monmouth is a tall order. They are
a wellrcoached talented team." comr
pleted Freeman.

Todd Howard

takes job with

the St. Louis
Rams

Greg Wallace, Grinnell College
acting athletic director, has an-
nounced the resignation of football
coach Todd Howard. Howard as-
sumes duties with the St. Louis
Rams at the beginning of March.

During a four-year tenure at
Grinnell, Howard had duties with
the Pioneer football program and
the sports information office. For
the past two seasons he coordi-
nated the defense for Coach
Wallace's team.

“Our football program has seen
a great turnaround while Coach
Howard has been with us. His
work with our athletes during the
season with the strength program
helped them become stronger and
faster. He also developed the
strength programs they used on
their own in the off-season. By far

his best ability was his knowledge ~-

of defense and his on-field coach-
ing." said Wallace.

“Over the last four
years [Todd
Howard] has been
hotly pursued on a
number of

occasions.”
— Greg Wallace, acting
Athletic Director

An allrstate high school football
player at Bryan, Texas, Howard
competed collegiately at Texas
A&M University. He started for
the Aggies under Coach Jackie
Sherrlll at outside linebacker. ,
Ater broke a 19-yeardrought and
competed in two consecutive Cot-
ton Bowls during Howard’s play
ing days. A thirdrround draft pick

ofthe Kansas City Chiefs, Howard . ‘
had a fiveryear professional career .i

ending with the Barcelona Drag-
ons in the World Bowl.

Prior to arriving in Grinnell, '.

Howard spent three seasons work-
ing every aspect of the defensive
game as a graduate assistant coach
at A&M. During that period the
Aggies posted a 32—5 record. He
holds BA and MA degrees in soci-
ology from Texas A&M.

“In some respects I’m not sur»
prised to see Todd leave," ex~
plained Wallace. “Over the last _
four years he has been hotly pur- '
sued on a number of occasions.
Todd's goal is to be a college head
coach some day. He felt the op-
portunity with the Rams would
help him achieve it."
