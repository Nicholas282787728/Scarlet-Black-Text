Letters

To Grinncll:

There was no escape from rhe
seven feet of rerror in Quad. No, l
don'r mean rhe serving line, I’m talk»
ing abour the gianr capr'n Crunch
rhar srood guard over rhe serving line.

l’m sure that a lot of people think
I’m ovcrrcacring here, that it was no
big deal. I believe it is a big deal be»
cause ofrhe inconsisicney wiih school
policy, the lack ofcscape for those of-
fended, and the value system that puts
the capr'n in Quad.

So, here's how the issues break
down.

1) consistency: The capr'n was
not there for a quite lunch with his
friends. he was rherc as adverrising.
Quaker Foods pays for rhe Capr'n cos—
tume, the Capt’n camera, and the
Capr’n'e camera man in order ro pro-
mote their product and increase sales.
Thar's whar adverrising is abourepro—
moting the good ofa company.

In rhis way advocaring eaiing
capr'n Crunch is srill advocaring a po-
sirion. In facr, he was invired in by
Dining services ro advocare that posie
tion. [don’t drink that this invitation

squares well with ihe dining service
policy iharsrares, “The dining hallsare
ro be mainrained free orpoliiicnl and/
or social cause dcmonsrrarions."
lfmyargumcnr so far has been roo
wgue, I oifer rhis as an apology. lasr
week rhe socialisrs were asked ro srop
advocaring rhcir values outside of
Quad, but an icon of corporare
America was invited inside to advo»
careeorporaievalues. This isrhelack
ofconsisrency that I am criticizing.

2) No Escape: I’m living in rhc
dorms rhis year, so I have to be on ihe
board plan. I’m not rich, so I can’t
afford io just ignore all rhe money I
pay to dining services and ear lunch
elsewhere. 1 have lirrlo clloicc bur ro

Kusrurica’s Balkan is a place of
immense recklessness and melancholy,
where people live in the moment:
drinking, whoring, singing, dancing,
loving, marrying — and killing. It is a
place of East-West conrradiciions,
where realiry and fanrasy (or represen-
tation oftcality), are interchangeable.
For instance, there‘s the scene in the
rhearer where an onsrage disruprion is
more dramarie rhai the afrecred my
being performed (Marko kidnaps his
lover, rhe acrress Naralija, in the
middle ofan aer). And when Blacky,
having escaped from rhe cellar and srill
believing war is on, attacks "Germans“

ammunirion are too much in abunr
dance in this parr ofrhe world not to
be put to use.
