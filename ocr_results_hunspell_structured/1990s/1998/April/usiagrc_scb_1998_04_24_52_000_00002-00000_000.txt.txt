Welcome to the Creature Inside you will ﬁnd the insidious darkness

understood only by the deepest you turn away, than the unorthodox formatting style will send

youmnmmonomer”... pages are not for the
faint of heart, but with a fair amount of
dedication and overall intelligence, they
can be traversed, and the journey will be
well worth it. You will find yourself stron—
ger, and able to face the day with a re-
newed clarity. You will wake up in the
morning and say to yourself ”Gee, self, to-
dayjust might be worth it. As long as I
have the Creature..." or perhaps ~1 don’tneed crank, so

long as I have my cafﬁnated music-orientated magazine.” You will want to cancel
your subscriptions to mainstream rock magazines, such as Rolling Stone, Spin, or
Swank. And so long as you’re a student at this ﬁne institution, you don't have to pay. Spend

your money on popcorn and such. And you will have only yourself and the tireless efforts
of our amazingly depraved staff to thank. Just remember:

You owe us big time. We put a lot of time into this and w%1"oo

don' t want to go away with out some sort of tangible re--
, ward. Thank you, and good reading.
