editor aboutTitular Head which had been edited for space and content. :
Several signatures were omitted and others were inadvertently appended '
to the letter. Although the newspaper retains the right to edit letters to z

tirety this week.

TO TITULAR HEAD ATTENDEES
AND THE GRINNELL COLLEGE
COMMUNITY:

Anyone who attended 1998's Titu»
lar Head is aware of the disrespect-
ful heckling and general derogatory
comments that were made about
films, the me, audience members,
judges. etcetera. As students of this
campus, we should not have to stand
for behavior that very few of us
found appealing injunior high. Rey
gardless of quality, all of the ﬁlms
submitted represent the hard work,
creativity, and diversity of our carn-
pus. While some commentary cer-
tainly can add to the experience of
Titular Head, constant obnoxious and
vulgar comments can only sour it.
Considering that there were a hand-
ful of disruptive audience members
among several hundred others at the
concert hall, we ﬁnd it disappoint-
ing that so few actually stood up for
their right to watch the movies. We
feel embarrassed to have had
prospectives and families visiting our
college while such activity took
place. We projected an unfortunate
image of the college to these people,
an image that is not in keeping with
the spirit of our school. We expect
common sense to prevail in future
events of this size and character.

Dear petition writers and friends:

You make our school look dumb
and lame and uptight and conserva-
tive. You make us ashamed to tell
people where we went to school.
You make us worry about the future.
Like when we're in the real world,
people will say: ”Grinnell—that
school used to be fun, but it went
down hill and now sucks ass. Which
era were you part of?” There are
times to be serious and smart. and
there are times to just drink and re-
lax and enjoy yourself, If you don‘t
know the difference or the balance,
maybe you belong somewhere with
real ﬁlm festivals and no self»gover»
nance policy. They might want you
to be in by ten. and they might not
let you watch movies with bad words
or nudity, but at least you’ll be pro.
tected from the likes of us. There's
something to be learned in tolerance
of people‘s social styles. You don’t
have to be part ofit, but you have to
deal with it. Wake up and smell the
stale beer, the Forum coffee for those
tough hangovers, and the Iowa al—
falfa. For our part, we promise to
never puke in your drinking founr
tains. Ifyou don't like it, well... lump
it. Lighten up. This is college, and
welcome to it.

Love,
Jen Shelton ’98
MLE Davis ’98

Dear Editor.

Yes,I went to Titular Head, and yes,
some of the movies were quite bad,
I had my opinions on which movies
did and‘did not suck, but I didn't feel
it necessary to make everyone else
miserable because of it. There were
hundreds of people in Harris Center
Concert Hall on April 11, but only
an extremely vocal minority yelling
Obscenities and holding a general
lack of respect for the ﬁlms, the rest
of campus. and the event itself.

In last week’s S&B Letters to the
Editor, the same vocal minority de-
fended itself anonymously by telling
the “naive ﬁrst-year student” to “get
used" to self-governance. Self-gov-
ernance gives students the right and
the privilege to take care of their own
lives withoutwatchdogs keeping tabs
of what they're doing/drinking]
smoking, It gives us responsibility
for ourselves. It does NOT give per-
mission and amnesty to those who
partake in drunken assholery, and it
certainly did not give anybody the
right to pelt us with cereal during
Titular Head. Once you start affect-
ing others with your behavior, you’ve
overstepped the bounds ofself-gov-
ernance.

I am a ﬁrst year student. though I
don’t own a "150 years of anarchy“
shin, listen to Fiona Apple or Paula
Cole and spend all my time in my
room. Nice pot shot. Lizz Westman
has called the petitioners (and by as-
sociation, me) “conservative," “Fas-
cist.” and accused us of breaking
school tradition. A staunch defense
of tradition is a rather conservative
trait by deﬁnition. so labeling us as

such is a fairly weak argument. If our.

request that we be treated with some
amount of dignity upset you, Lizz,
and caused stress in your life, get
yourself a squeeze ball. and don't
take it out on the rest of us.

If Ms. Westman or anyone else
would like to further defend their
behavior, I encourage them to do so
in an open manner, rather than hid-
ing behind the general anonymity of
the darkened theater (Lizz excluded).
I freely invite every drunken asshole
to declare the pride they take in their
role at Titular Head, and to bring
themselves out of the shadows. I
wish them luck in defending them—
selves to any degree ofeloquence,

I don’t see Titular Head as a hip.
Sundancey ﬁlm festival. Many of the
movies were crap, granted, but sev-
eral others were well»made. funny.
entertaining, or all of the above. 1
came to See these. and I was willing
to Sit through the bad movies to see
them without giving everyone a hard
time about it. I don’t consider my-
self Fascist or even conservative in
my beliefs, and I don’t consider the
behavior of these twenty-odd people
to be a positive image of Grinnell.

sincerely,
Fred Beukema '01

Dear Editor,
After reading the Scarlet and Black

from Friday, April 17,1 feel I must
respond to several of the statements
made by various people. Let mejust
start by saying that I am an alumna
and a staff member and that I at»
tended Titular Head in 1991—1995,

I’m not sure who has been spread-
ing the myth that poor behavior at
Titular Head is a tradition. Let me
assure you that they are wrong. This
"tradition" started in 1994 or so and
before that, the comments made were
much more benign and usually said
between movies, not during them.
This shouting and throwing things
is, in general, new behavior. You’re
right, it's not Sundance but it's still a
creative outlet and as such deserves
a little respect. You are assuming that
everyone who makes movies for
Titular Head is making a bad movie
just so their friends can heckle it. I’m
willing to bet this is not the case with
everyone, Screaming through the
movies is akin to smearing paint on
a sculpture in the Forum basement
because you don’t like it. Tnist me,
behavior like that won’t get you very
far.

You mention the conservative atti»
tude of some of the people at Titular
Head made Grinnell look bad in front
of specs and parents. This is also
untrue. For one thing. it's not con-
servative, it’s polite. And for another,
several prospectives mentioned that
they were disturbed by the behavior
of some of the students at Titular
Head and it wasn’t the students
sitting quietly trying to watch the
movies. The activities you were en»
gaging in are expected to occur at a
state school where such things are
more of the norm. When these things
are done in the real world, those re-
sponsible are usually physically re-
moved from the area. Surely. this is
not the image of Grinnell you want
to project.

And, before you go accusing people
of sophomoric behavior, look to your
own. While I’m sure it felt great to
write that article, it's the pot calling
the kettle black. Using the terms
“complacent motilerP‘kers,” “you
suck," and telling people to leave is
not the behavior of a mature indi—
vidual, I bet it felt great to yell and
scream at Titular Head, too, but mak-
ing yourself feel good doesn‘t always
mean it’s the right thing to do.

To those of you who signed the pe-
tition, good job. You’re the kind of
students Grinnell should be proud to
have on this campus,

Stephany Moon
Assistant Curator of the Physics
Museum, Class of 1995.

Dear Editor.

This past week I attended the two
presidential candidates’ question and
answer sessions with students and at
each was surprised and dismayed by
the low student turnout. During the
fall semester many students critir

, cized the search process saying that

they had no voice in the presidential
selection. Yet, when given the oppor-
tunity to contribute to the decision
making process, students have been
apathetic.

I ﬁnd it curious that ourcampus can
be so outraged by obscenities at Titti-
lar Head and be so indifferent to the
presidential search process.

Luckily there is still time. '1\vo
more candidates for president will be
visiting campus in the coming weeks.
I hope that more students will take
advantage of this opportunity.

Dear Editor,

Two weekends ago, there was an
embarrassing amount of vandalism
on South Campus. Ironically, the
most shocking of the many desmic-
live acts, a water balloon propelled
bullet-like through three panes of
dorm room glass and still not bursts
ing, was the only one of these inci»
dents that was an accident (or, at least
not the result of drunken foolishness)
and dealt with responsibly and ma-
turely by the perpetrators. Every-
thing else was anonymous and
shameful. There was the chocolate
syrup all over the laundry in the
Gardner laundry room and inside the
machines; two seriously damaged
couches in Gardner; one broken door
(yes, the whole door and notjust he
window) in Cleveland pit; and a
kicked hole in the wall in Cleveland
pit. Which is not to mention the

A Foolish Consistency

BY IVY CHANG
Columnist

Sleep and I have known one an-
other since we were born. Our moth-
ers were good friends who happened
to have gotten pregnant at around the
same time, You know the story. From
the time Sleep and I were young. our
mothers used to joke about how cute
it would be ifSleep and Ivy married
each other someday. Ignorant to their
devious scheming, Sleep and 1 en»
joyed the innocence of our respec-
tive childhoods and spent countless
blissful hours together. When we
entered kindergarten. we became
sweethearts on our own accord.
However, the older we grew, the less
time I had for him. By the time we
entered high school, I barely ever
saw him.

Our relationship suffered. Sleep ac-
cused me of becoming aloof and dis»
rant. I told him I still cared. He didn't
believe me. He claimed I wasn’t re-
ciprocating. He was always there for
me and 1 never had time for him. I
had no defense. It was true. All 1
could argue was my intent. I wished
I had more time to spend with him,
but there were only so many hours
in a day. His jealousy grew to irra»
tional proportions. My intent began
to waver. He must have felt as if he
was competing with the world for
my attention. That was the only ex-
planation I could think of. Sleep be-
gan following. almost stalking, me.
I saw him everywhere I went. He

would come in my room in the mom-
ing and turn my alarm off so that I
might miss school and spend the day
with him. When this technique failed,
he started showing up in my classes.
My teachers didn't know what to say.
I didn’t know what to do.

My mom, of course, had no prob-
lem with it. She sympathized with
Sleep and said I should spend more
time with him. 1 secretly wondered
whetherI was in a relationship worth
continuing. I knew both ofour moms
would be disappointed, but Sleep and
I had grown apart. We had different
priorities and I knew I wasn’t pull-
ing my weight in the relationship.

We had a "talk." He cried. I cried.
We opted for a separation. It lasted
for almost a full day before my re»
solve failed me. I realized that I
needed him far more than I had been
willing to admit, though no one, in-
cluding myself, could ﬁgure out why.
Some people argued that I really
didn‘t need him. and it was all psy-
chological. We all had theories »
codependency was a popular one -
but none of them have been proven.
Sleep had never wanted the separa-
tion to begin with, We reevaluated.
How could we make ours a healthy
and not obsessive codependcncy? I
promised to set aside time for him if
he would stop pressuring me for
more than I could give. Eager to
work out the kinks in our relation-
ship at any expense, Sleep agreed.

Today, Sleep and I are still together,
for better or for worse. Sometimes I
resent needing him as much as I do.
but I’ve weighed the advantages and
disadvantages of a long»term rela-
tionship and found that, at least for
the time being, the advantages are
quite worth the sacriﬁce. Neverthe-
less, I can't guarantee that I’ll always
feel this way, so right now we’re talc
ing it one step at a time and I'm not
making any promises I can’t keep.

 

weekly trashing of Cleveland lounge.
And what about the ridiculous
amount of broken glass on campus'.7
Hello, that stuff is DANGEROUS!
I would like to say to these vandals:
what is the matter with you? Were
you raised by wolves!'.7! Contrary to
what seems to be popular belief, it is
not the job of Facilities Management
to suffer the consequences of these
drunken toddlers. They have enough
to do without putting up with this
kind of disrespect. For those of you
who know Bev, the custodian for
Cleveland Cottage, you know that
she is one of the sweetest women you
will meet while you attend Grinnell
College, and I have seen her abused
and watched the inhabitants and visi»
tors of Cleveland disregard her feel»
ing—her humanity for that matter#
time and time again. And she is. by
far, not the only FM employee that
has to deal with this. Does anybody
ever talk to their custodian? Have
you ever wondered what their day is
like, or what they‘re thinking about?

They’re people y’know. Have you
ever wondered how hard it is for
some of them not to glare at us in-
stead of giving us the polite srrtiles
that we often receive? I couldn’t say
for sure, but I bet it’s not easy.

I hope these vandals have the de4
cency and common sense to be
ashamed. True, it comes with the
territory that there will be some ex-
cess damage to school property dur—
ing the strange goings on that ﬁll up
every weekend here, but look at the
tally of destruction above and try to
tell me that it‘s reasonable. Yes, it
would be nice if you apologized. but
it would be best if you started re-
specting the fact that this is all of our
property and acknowledged the fact
that someone has to pick up after you,
sweep up the aftermath of your
apocalypse, and even pay for it!!!

And I suppose I’m a little con-
cerned. Imean, you guys have some
wicked bad karma coming your way.
