Grant 0. Gale, 94, physics teacher
and faculty leader at Grinncll College
for nearly 70 years, died of corollary
artery disease Tuesday, April 14, at
Grinnell Regional Medical Center.

Services are pending.

Prof. Gale taught physics to lion.
dreds of Grinnell students, beginning
in 1928, and was with the college for
well over one-third ofits existence. He
was an innovative teacher who was
devoted to his students, interim Presi-
dent Charles L. Duke recalled.

“He made the classroom exciting.
He became a mentor for many stur
dents, and they often were like meni-
bers of his family. He remained in
regular contact with his students alter
they graduated. He always put his stu~
dents first," Duke said.

William Case, professor ofphysics
at Grinnell, called Gale “very much a
model teacher.“

Model to younger faculty

“He was a role model to a lot of
younger faculty, including me, an ex-
ample for the way we should interact
with and care for students," Case said.
“He could remember students from all
his teaching days, and many of his
formerstudentscamebacktovisithim."

Prof. Gale taught physics to many of
Grinnell‘s famous alumni, including
musician Herbie Hancock, physicist
George Simon, former Sony Corpora-
tion of America president and CEO
Michael Schulhof and the late Robert
N. Noyce, the coinventor of the inte-
grated circuit.

In 1943, Prof. Gale used his con-
nections at Bell Telephone Labora-
tories to obtain one of two original
transistors to use in his classes. Noyce
creditedGalewithbeingtheindlvidual
who made the difference in his career
and life.

“My proudest achievements are the
physics majors we‘ve turned out at
Grinnell,"Gale saidin 31994 articlein
the Grinnell Magazine. “Noyce has
gotten his fair share of attention, but
there have been others who have done
well, too. I'm proud of them as well."

Chaired faculty

Prof. Gale also chaired the faculty
for several terms and helped gain the
privilege ofacademic leave.

“For many of the years I was here,
Grant was chair of the faculty. He had

Grinnell College nearly 70 years ago,

tlle total respect of the faculty as a
person with integrity. Wllen he spoke
ata meeting, the faculty listened,“said
Joseph F. Wall in the 1994 Grinnell
Magazine article. Wall was professor
eiricntus ofhistory and a 1941 gradu-
atc ofGrinnell, He died in 1996.

Grant Gale was bortn Dec. 29, 1903,
in Prentice, Wis, He graduated from
higll school in Eau Claire, MlCII.,‘3T\d
earned his bachelor‘s degree in elec-
trical engineering from the University
ofWisconsin in 1926 and his master‘s

What a difference a sunny day
makes! Even if it's sandwiched be-
tween two rainy days, it tlocs make a
difference!

Last Friday's sunshine, even with
the prospect cfadditional rain on Sat-
urday, brought a spn'ng to steps, a
smilctc faces, talkofgarden, the pros-
pectofspring bonnets, in fact, hope for
a new ~cuson.

Speaking ofbonncts, how about the
insatiable hattable Netia Worlcy']

Never does one see her Without a
becomingchapeau complimenting her
costume, be it a sports outfit or while
modelingDoncastcrfashionsatKPaul!

Her hat wardrobe is endless, varied,
colorful, distinctive and a few other
things. As a matter of fact, Around
wonders if she has a special room in
her house to house her hats.

Also a “mad hatter," ifonc may use
the paraphrase to describe people ad»
dicted to hats, is Shirley McKibbin
who never is seen witllout a good-
looking topper, a habit she claims to
have had for years.

Neither is either of them subject to
the whims of fashion which dictates
hats “in" one season and maybe not in
another.

Actually,thesetwoareway aheadof
the rest of us. not only in projecting
their personalities through their cos—
Iumes, but in protecting thcmsclvcs
fromthat very same sun which Around
proclaimed earlier, whose rays can be
harmful to skin and whose glare can
damage eyes. Whether in fashion or
out, we all can take a cue from them

So, with hat inhand,and withoutihe
necessity to pass the hat for a good
cause,andalsowithouttalkingthrougli

foremost doyennes of hatting!

He continued to serve the college as
curator of the Grinnell Physics His-
torical Museum from 1972 until the
time of his death.

“I think it's the only working physe

“We’ve used that equipment in lec-
tures. A lot ofthe pieces come out of
the cabinet and onto the lecture table
for demonstrations even today."

Molsberry stands
in pulpit Sunday

The Rev. Bob Molsberry, partially
paralyzed in May 1997 when he was
struck by a hitrand-run driver while
bicycling east of Grinnell, inspired
parishioners at his church Sunday by
standing in the pulpit to deliver the
Easter message at the United Church
of Christ # Congregational.

The event was captured on tape by
a Channel 5 TV news crew and broad-
cast on the station’s 5:30 and 10 pm.
newscasts Sunday as “an Easter
miracle of sorts in Grinnell."

Molsherry, with the aid ofa walker,
was able to move to the pulpit, Mem-
bers of the congregational gave him a
standing ovation.

Molsbei‘ry recently wrote a letter to
the editor of The HeraldrRegister in
which heurgedthedriverofthe pickup
truck" that struck him to come for
ward, confess and receive the
minister’s forgiveness.

So far, the driver has not done so.

Two worthy campaigns
deserve local support

Two venerable local institutions, Grinnell College and Grinnell Regional
Medical Center, currently are conducting campaigns to raise money. Both
deserve broad and generous support.

In the college's case, the campaign is the annual Town and Gown drive.
Money raised locally goes for support ofthe 1B. Grinnell Scholarships
awarded to area high school graduates who go on to attend the college. At
present, lline Grinnell High School graduates are receiving top-notch school-
ing here, thanks in large measure to the fact that they‘ve received the 1.13.
Grinnell Scholarships.

It's true, ofcourse, that Grinnell College is blessed with a large endow-
ment. To some, that means it‘s not really all that important to support the
college ﬁnancially. The point that needs to be made, though, is that Grinnell
provides a remarkable level of student ﬁnancial aid. It’s expensive to attend a

'four-year college the caliber of Grinnell. To retain top faculty members, the

college has to offer generous salaries and beneﬁts. Most ofthe people on the
faculty here are good enough to choose where they teach; many could head to
an Ivy League school or avoid Iowa winters by teaching at, say, Stanford. To
its credit, Grinnell has managed to maintain that highrcaliber faculty, thanks
to the college's academic reputation and its encouragement of ongoing
research and study.

There are lots of otlierrreasons for local residents to support the college
ﬁnancially, of course. Certainly the most obvious is that the college is a
major financial presence. It is a signiﬁcant employer, and its faculty, staff and
students spend large sums of money in the local community. But perhaps the
greatest contribution the college makes is to the quality oflife fGrinnell.
We can think ofvery few colleges that offer public use of facilities like
Grinnell’s Physical Education Complex 7 and even fewer that admit
townspeople to major concerts, plays, lectures and other events that so
enliven and enrich this community.

I

Grinnell Regional Medical Center hasn’t conducted a public capital
campaign for some time — over 15 years, in fact — and the effort now
underway is critical to the hospital‘s future.

Organizers ofthc campaign are trying to raise $8 million in what is the
third phase of an ambitious improvement program that began With the
retooling of infrastructure and then saw completion of the magniﬁcent
Ahrcns Medical Ans Building. To complete the improvements, GRMC needs
to make major renovations in speciﬁc areas ofthe hospital where vital health
care is provided. Speciﬁcally, the hospital wants to improve and modemizc
facilities related to women’s health and obstetrics, emergency medicine,
surgery and intensive care. Those improvements are important to the accredi-
tation proccss, of course, but they are also essential to making Grinnell
Regional a stale-ofrtherart institution in terms ofthe services it provides to its

patients.

Grinnell Regional is quickly
becoming a major player in Iowa
health care. Its surgeons and some
other practitioners have established
an institute to practice and expand
on advances in minimally invasive
surgical techniques. The list of
specialiﬁswho provide services in

Grinnell rivals those of mach larger hospitals. The qutiiilfofthe medical staff
in general is extraordinarily high — and notjust for a city the sic: of Grin-
nell.

In shon, Grinnell Regional Medical Center is a gem ofa facility that offers
levels ofhcalth care that easily exceed those provided in bigger Iowa cities,
thanks not only to the expertise of its practitioners but to the skill ofthe
hospital‘s administration,

So far, the campaign seems to be going well. Grinnell Regional has been
able to demonstrate that it has the ﬁnancial support ofits own medical staff
and employees, as well as that of many corporations in the area the hospital
serves. It’s also up to individual contributors to ensure the hospital‘s future as
a leading Iowa health care provider.

I

Both Grinnell College and Grinnell Regional Medical Center have helped
make this community richer. Tltc qualities they provide Grinnell can‘t be
quantified.

But the amount of money tltey raise locally can be. That's why local
support is so important 7 notjiist to the college and the hospital, but to the
community as a whole

We hope everyone recognizes this and gives generously.

Second semester is almost over.
