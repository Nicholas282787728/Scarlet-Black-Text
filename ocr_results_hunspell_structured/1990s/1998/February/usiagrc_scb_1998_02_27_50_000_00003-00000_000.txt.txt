Slagle exposes Grinnellians to a
western filmmaking style through
Japanese eyes. Though he concedes
that independent and foreign ﬁlms
have a good showing, he hopes “that
people would want to broaden their
horizons."

The broadening of horizons is pre
cisely what attracts many
Grinnellians to independent films.

As a result of such experimentae
lion, Grinnellians are finding inde
pendent ﬁlms increasingly more ap.
pealing than Hollywood ﬁlms. Slagle
noted, ”There are good films out
there that don‘t go for big-budget."
The distinction between Hollywood
and independent is one not only of
budget. Dunham pointed out that In-
dependent films are “unpolluted,”
without the plot distractions of H01-
lywood. “In Hollywood," hc contin-
ued, “the chief concern is
money...independent films are con-

‘ cerned with vision, artistry." Lind

agreed, noting that “independents
films are unafraid to tackle issues."
Lind commented on Hollywood’s
dominance in the ﬁlm industry: “[It]
doesn't really matter. . .good ﬁlms

Hindustani recitals
contrast Western

sound

BY RYAN OLSEN
Staff Writer

On Sunday, March lst, the ﬁrst of
two recitals bringing Indian Classi-
cal Music tothe Grinnellcampus will
take place in the South Lounge of the
Forum at 2:00 pm. Vocalist Hema
Shanda will perform with two ac-
companying instrumentalists: the
recital focuses on what is known as
the Hindustani, or North Indian, Tra-
dition of music.

Shenda, the mother of a recent
Grinnell graduate. has been to the
campus to perform before, and is
currently touring the US. As Roger
Veiier of the Mustc Dcpartmenimcn-
lioncd, “these concerts give curious
people an opportunity to hear the
vocal equivalent to much of the in-
strumental music" ihai they might
have heard before. Indian music cone
tains numerous instruments which
musicians play during performances,
but the voice. as Vetlcr explained, “is
considered to be the primordial in-
strument;" other instruments “seek to
imitate it."

Initially, it might seem that music
from a non-western country such as
India mightdiffer dramatically from
the music that we are used to hear-
ing. As Vettcr mentioned, Indian
music and musicians have developed
a great deal of ”melodic improvisae
tion; pure melody without harmony."
The music has a “rhythmic richness,
setting it apart from Western music,"
Vetter added.

Ashraflaffer ‘01 plays two Indian
instruments, the Harmonium and the
Sitar. The Harmonium, which laffer
has played for ten years, is a wind
instrument, analogous to “an accor.
dion,” as she commented. “It is easy
to play, but is regarded as crude. It
doesn’t have distinct notes." One
hand plays the instrumenl while the
other pumps air into ii, as Jaffer ex-
pléined, Li, ,... ' , "
' \ “As the program foraoiidays per—
formance explained. the I-Iarmonium
“is used to reinforce the melody in
composed sections ofperformances,
and to shadow and echo the soloisi‘s
spontaneous melodic ideas in impro-

vised scciions," In addition to' the
Harmonium, two other instruments
will be featured in this Sunday's pen.
fonnance. The tambura, deﬁned by
the program as a "longenecked lute
with four strings," and the tabla, “the
classical drum of North India," will
complete the ensemble.

The Sitar, another instrument
which Jaffer plays here in addition
to in her home country of India, is a
string instrumentanalogous to a guie
tar or similar Western instrument. It
is made ofwood and dried-out pumps
kins. With the Sitar, “one base note
is continually being played" through.
out a musician‘s performance, as
Jaffer explained, in addition to the
notes making up the rest of the per-
formance.

In original Indian music. as Iaffer
mentioned, there were three instru-
ments. Today, an Indian musrcian has
many other instruments to choose
from, many of which have come
about as a result ofincorporating for-
eign instruments into traditional
ones.

What many Wesicmers may find
different about Indian music is the
role oflhe performer in deciding the
rhythm and style ofplay ofthe piece
the ensemble is performing. As Jaffer
mentioned, “as opposed to the per-
son playing the insirument selling the
rhythm, the instrument liselfsets it."
Jaffcrwentontocommentthat“mosl
Indian music is self-composed.“

As opposed to creating a repotoire
of music which they know well and
repeatedly perform, Indian musicians
have their own styles of playing,
laffer explained.

Sunday’s performance will in-
clude presentations of “three types
oinndustani (North Indian) songs,“
as the program explained. Traditional
to such performances is the act oflhe
soloist announcing the items to be
performed Just prior to each selec-
lion.

“It is great for two such perform—

,"ers to come in‘ a:single semester,". .
~.cojnment'ed-ypttei", making reference
to the second performance taking
place on Tuesday, March 10. Look
forward to a concert presenting mu-
sic in the South Indian Tradition.

The results of Bob’s World—Famous
Coffee-Drinking Contest:

st Place-Joe Chifari drank 14 cups of coffee in 9|

inutes without vomiting. Joe says that he will
ompete each of his remainingthree years as well
e fought several great waves of nausea over the
ourse of the contest as he and Rio stayed neck
nd neck with each other, but did at last prevail.
ncredibly, he also beat his own words per hour
ecord. Joe is a national record holder in talking.

nd Place-Rio Roth-Barreiro drank 13.9 cups of
offee in 85 minutes and then vomited, freezing hi-
core and taking him out of the contest. Filo re-
ained extremely composed over the course of
he contest. We never would have known he had
onsumed any coffee at all until he quite unexpecl
dly lost his chicken pattie parmesan in the last
inutes of the contest. Fortunately the chicken
nattie parmesan was well-aimed.

ied at 7 cups. We all thought they could have
-one a bit longer and made themselves a bit sicker,

lcer and several shots of tequila in her, she be-

an vomiting after ten cups of coffee and finally
penl the night in the hospital because of severe
ehydration. The “No-Vomiting Clause" was then
cut in effect, freezing the score of anyone who
omited at the point of vomiting,

and weekend of May, potentially at
the Commercial Street's Art Center.
Rains says that “How to ..... Rele

in the developmental process and
ihar’one Will really have to see the

play to fully understand it and grasp
its core concepts,
