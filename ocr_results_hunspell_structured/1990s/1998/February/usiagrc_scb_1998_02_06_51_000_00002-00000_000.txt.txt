Spring break is just around the corner:
Are you aware of yourA/ternatives?

Spring break is not much more
than a month away: have you coir
sidered all of your alternatives?
Have you considered the Alterna-
tive Break Program?

Forty»eightGrinnellCollegestu-
dents 7 four groups of 12 7 will
each commit tlleir entire break to
contributing tlleir services in ﬁelds
suchasconservationandurbanout-
reach, or assisting with women‘s
sllelters, gay and lesbian organiza—
tions, or disaster reliefefforts.

Student volunteer coordinator
and trip leader Jen Larimer, ajun-
ior from Goshcn, Indiana, explains
that the purpose of the program is
to “interest people in community
service.”

Oﬁen,Larimersays, people seem
to find it difficult to work smaller
commitments ofservice into their
regularweeklyschedulingThetwo
weeks of service which the Alter»
native Break Program comprises,
however, helps people focus on
how important community service
really is. “A lot ofpeople come out
of the program very deeply af—
fected," Larimer says.

Sarah Fowles, a senior from
Normal, Illinois, agrees, referring
to the experience as “intense.”

“It’s total immersion 7 24

leam about your limits. You also
learn about how to work with a
group: you have to. And you get
very involved in the service you’re
doing.“

Fowles traces her ideas about com-
munity service to 11 years in Girl
Scouts, followed by two years as a
troop leader here in Grinnell during
her first two years as a student. For
her, an important element of com»
munityserviceis“beingawal'eofthe
community, in general, and of the
resources in the community."

In 1996, Fowles participated in
an Alternative Break in the south»
east, helping with the relief efforts
in the wake of Hurricane Fran.

In 1997, she was the leader ofa

only six golfers turned out for the
Annual Groundhog Flog charity
golf tourney on Monday. Des
Moines’ Rob Smith took the tour-
ney with a score of4l, while Dave
Jones, Bob Hamilton, Duane
Kriegel, Tammy Kriegel and
Grinnell’s very own Crosby also
participated.

The event, covered by such cos-

at the Gerber»Hart Library, a gay/
lesbian archive in Chicago; pro—
vided support for research efforts
at a clinic for low-income residents
ofChicago; and painted the inside
ofa women’s shelter in Montreal,
Canada.

“I learned a lot about different
communities of people,“ Fowles
says, “and about the different is-
sues facing those groups.”

After graduation in the spring,
community service remains very
mucll a pan of Fowles’ future: she
plans to participate in the
Americorps program which re-
wards one year of community ser~
Vice with ﬁnancial credit toward
past or future education.

“Community service is an inte-
gral part of my life,” she explains.
“Americorps is an opportunity to
take that to an extreme for awhile,
before 1 go to graduate school and
have a bunch of other concerns to
worry about.“

Larimer says it is not unusual for
individuals who have been Alter»
native Break leaders to move from
Grinnell to one ofthe Americorps
programs.

Nuts & bolts
As in springs past, there are four

differenttripsplannedforthisspring
break. On one ofthe trips, partici-
pants will do conservation work in
New Mexico and community out»
reach at St. Martin 5 Soup Kitchen
in San Francisco, and also work
with SLUG (San Francisco League
ofUrban Gardners) on city beauti~
i'lcation projects.

Anothertripto Springﬁeld, Mis-
souri, will combine community
outreach at “The Kitchen” with
work at Agape House, a facility
where women can spend weekends
near loved ones who are serving
time in prison.

Details On the other two trips —
both to Arizona: one to Flagstaff
and the other to Tuscon 7 were
unavailable at press time.

Students should be aware that
the program — funded by a variety
of campus sources and supple-
mented by a nominal fee from par-
ticipants, traditionally under $75 7
has a limited numberof available
spots.

Larimer says that last year, al-
most twice as many people applied
as the program had spaces for. She
says organizers have resisted in-
creasing the number of people on
individual trips because, as the
group becomes larger, the experi-
ence becomes less personal.

Volunteers needed to work
