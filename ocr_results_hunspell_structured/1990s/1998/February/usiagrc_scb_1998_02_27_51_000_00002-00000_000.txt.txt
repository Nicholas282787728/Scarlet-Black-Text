Robert Hamilton ofMontezuiiia, on
the otherhand, calls ita wrench to take
a separator apan to clean it after sepa»
rating milk and creamAgrceing with
him is Homer Perry who describes
quite graphically as a child in Corning
watching his mother use the wrench to
tighten or loosen the bolt at the top of
the bowl in a cream separator to re
move it forcleaning. The nut was about
the size ofa dollar, which would fit
into the opening of the tool. and his
tnotlicr did it religiously every day.

wilbur Eycstone concurs, saying it
was a wrench to tighten the nut on an
international, DeLavelle, Galloway or
Iowa brand ofcream separator, though
he thinks probably tlle International or
DcLavelle.

Gardner Andersonthinks itcould be
a wrench for a cream separator but
votes also for tts use as a water pump
packing nut wrench on an Interna-
tional M or Super M.

And William Momson knows ltas a
wrench for a water pump on an older
model car which took packing. The
vehicle had a shaﬁ in the radiator and
if the packing came out, the pressure
went down and would lcak. It had
notchcs which needed to be tightened
or loosened with the wrench, perhaps
a 1927 to ‘28 Model T or a 1928 to
1930 Chevrolet. Earlytractors also had
this need.

Charles Quillen calls it a spanner
wrench used to hold a grinder or air
hose while putting on a new stone. And
Darren Walton calls from Cedar Rap-
ids to say it’s a shock adjustor absorb-
ing wrench for a motorcycle, probably
a Harley Davidson, although he him-
selfdrives a Moto Guzzi.

there, Around can‘t quite see it. Per-
