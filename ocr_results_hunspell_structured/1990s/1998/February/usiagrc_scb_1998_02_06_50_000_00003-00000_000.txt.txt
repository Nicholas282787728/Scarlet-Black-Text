The Grinncll Concerts Commltr
tee (GCC) is working to augment the
college's exposure to live music by
expanding potential on-eampus con-
cert locations. Among potential con-
cert sites is Ciardner Lounge. In or-
der to cut expenses and simplify the
logistical process, llte GCC is work
ing with student government to
change current Grinnell policy,
which restricts the use of SGA and
GCC funds for campus lounge par
ties. That practice was instituted af-
ter the Harris Center was completed

“We're working with SGA to al-
low the Concerts Committee to al»
low Gardner shows," GCC member
Matt Ryan. “The [amount of] money
you need to play at Harris is huge
The only thing we have to pay for
for Gardener shows is gas,,,t guess I
could liken Harris to Grinncll’s large
stage, like an auditorium in a city,
whereas Gardener is more like a club,
a smaller \tcniic.”

Having Gardner as a resource
would make the scheduling process
easier and allow more bands to come
to Grinncll, said GCC Chair Paul
Conn. Conn, who is also workitig
with Tom Crady, Steve Larson attd
the rest ofthe Committee on Student
Life, feels that this change will line

prove Grinncll’s ability to host live
music.

“The Harris Center gets scheduled
pretty routinely. That can interfere
with the schedules of artists. Hav-
ing another place to throw concerts
would help us schedule events, es-
pecially wtth bands that may be na-
tional but wouldn't warrant the kind
of audience that would fill Harris."

Scheduling is only one pic series
of obstacles iii attiacting live music
in Gi-inneli. “Our access here isn’t
as good as it would be in a city or at
a club,” said Conn
“were dealing with a unique situa-
tion here in that there is no fee for
people to come in estudents pay their
activitiy fee at the beginning of the
semester and that’s that There isn‘t
much exposure here which cuts
down on the number of acts that can
be booked."

The GCC thinks live performance
aficionados on campus will enjoy
this tertrt’s lineup. According to

' Conn, Grinnell's current lineup in-

cludes the jazzy/hiphop hybrid Liq-
uid Soul on Friday, February 13th

Conn. “Alot of stutfis being worked

Conn, who has also woikcd as a

“This is the ﬁrst performance ever

commented regarding the music in
the Feb 8 program, “The Schubert
piece is very cheerful, but the Ligcti
piece is very much full of grief."

Ligeti lived an intense childhood
in Nazi Germany, and wrote a piece
which is extremely etnotional, drae
matic, and very “intense," and some
what of a “downer." as Gaub de
scribed. However, Gaub does not
want anyone to get discouraged and
not come to the performance. “We
have put in close to fifty hours of
work on this piece," he mentioned,
and added that the performers have
been “very committed to the music."

“Last year we focused on the works
of Brahms," he mentioned This

hopes to carry the series on into next

performing “some of the works of
Beethoven.”

Projecting into the future
Finally, Harris updates to feature-style 35mm.

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Walking into the Harris Cincma’s
projection room, it is impossible not
to notice the domineering presence
ofthe new 35mm projector, Installed
over winter break. it is the size of
abom six refrigerators, consisting of
the projector itself and two huge
reels.

When the Harris Center was ﬁrst
built, a 35mm projector was inn
tended, but the venue was ﬁtted with
a 16mm projectorinstead Now, with
the new 35min projector, Grinnell
College has the opportunity to see
moVies as they were originally tneatit
to be seen.

Feature films are originally shot
on 35mm film atid are shown in
movie theaters on 35mm film. The
Harris Cinema, until now, has been
using lomm. The new 35mm projec-
tor allows the audience lti sec the film

as they would see it in a conventional
movie theater.

Another advantage of the new
projector is its better sound quality
When the cinema was first built, it
was installed wtth surround sound
speakers. Unfortunately, they were
unable to be fully utilized until the
installment of the new projector The
digital sound system of the 35mm
pr0jcctor allows for surround sound
not only on 3Smmfi1ms, but on films
with sun‘ound sound which may be
on 16mm or Video.

The selection of films on 35mm
is also far more expansive than that
ofthe létn'm Feature films are usu-
ally released on 35mm, then on
16mm, and finally video. With the
new projector, Grinnell will be able
to see a wtdcr variety of feature ﬁlms
SOOIIET

Although the Harris Cinema was
originally meant to have a 35mm
projector, thc idea wasn't addressed

until recently The 1996-97 Films
Committee, chaired by Matt Saiia,
asked for a 35mm projector and gathr
ered student support for it. The pro
jector was purchased last semester at
acostof over forty thousand dollars,
Nonetheless, Laura Schwartz ‘98»
head of the SGA Films Commitee,
said that “it’s definitely worth it," as
it should last a long time,

Schwartz also spoke of some of
the difficulty in scheduling the ﬁlms
for this semstet because of the
change in film to 35mm. Although
the distribution company has stayed
the same, the films now come from
different places. Also, the high dcr
niaitd for the films cause a problem:
lfthere is a dclay in forwarding the
film in one area, it wtll undoubtedly
affect its arrival in another area Air
though the schedule is a bit bumpy
now, Schwartz predicts that it Will be
smoothed out iii the coming weeks
