COMMO N S E N S E
Washburn's political education

I want to say a little about how I
came to think as a conservative.

For ten years I attended a small
private school in Brooklyn Heights.
Contrary to what one might expectof
such an elite institution. its teachers
are, with few exceptions, somewhere
to the left of Gore Vidal. One of my
history teachersiostcnsibly an
American history icachcr—wentinto
tirades against apartheid in South
Africa and death squads in El Salva-
dor, which he had visited a few years
before, Often he reiterated an image
ofa sidewalkdrenched wim theblood
of death squad victims. After taking
his coursc,onethought that apartheid
andU.S.-sponsoreddeath squads were
the gravest problems in the world.
Consequently, during “Social Awarer
ness Week” students distributed anti»
apartheid and anti-Salvadoran litera
ture, and little else. Few other things
in the world were worthy of moral
indignation and protest.

An “English teacher,“ having ex-
coriated the materialism of capitalist
America, remarked that a child in
Vietnam who found a coin lying on a

Mike

road would promptly and dutifully
bring it to the nearest police station.
I-low fortunate that the revolution
succeeded! Shegavehcrstudents the
impression that liberated Vietnam
was some sort of canth paradise.
Although, as an impressionable boy,
Iacceptedwhatmyieachcrstaughtas
a reasonable and moderate view of
theworld, Inow recognizeitas some—
thing else. The crimes of right-wing
govemments deserve denunciation;
the same or worse crimes may be
overlooked when they serve progres-
sive interests. This is moral relative
ism. an intellectual cancer.

They also taught us, ad nauseam,
about the oppression of blacks by a
society that was still rife with white
racism. l soon learned how divorced
this notion was from reality.

One wmtcr afternoon I was walk-
ing with a friend on Fulton Street in

downtown Brooklyn. As we ap
preached the comer, a black man
standing there spoke to me.

“Are you a white boy?" he asked,

Having barely heard him, I said,

“ What?”

“Are you a white boy?” the man
repeated.

“Yes," I said, not knowing how
else to respond.

“You look it," he said. “And you
look soft.”

My friend and I walked on.

A year or so later, a friend of my
brother’s. about ten years old, was
mugged near his house by two black
teenagers. He had all ofthree dollars.
While mugging him they jeered him
as a “whitey.”

In my life, I have never threat-
ened, let alone harmed, a black. But
in New York alone, incidents like
those described above happen thou-
sands of times a year. They are, in
fact, accepted by many New Yorkers
as a factoflifein the city. According
to my school's ethos, however, I was

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Communication essential to SGA

Sclfvgovernance. This is a term
that is thrown around quite often on
the Grinnell campus. The idea is that
students are the reason for the
college’s existence; therefore, stu—
dents should have a voice in its afr
fairs—it seems quite logical. EPCS,
residence halls, all-campus evean,
student security, judicial council,
SGA—all of these are examples of
the self-governing system that is
stressed atGrinnell. Forsomeofus. it
is why we chose to attend Grinnell. It
is a pretty nifty concept; a concept
that we must take advantage of.

It seems that the existence of self-
govemanceisdependentontwocom-
poncnts. First of all, it demands con~
sciousness. In order to govern appror
priately, we must be aware of our
surroundings, It is necessary to keep
ourselves informed and aware of
changes,as wellasconsistencies.Self-
govemance‘s second trait is activity.
Self-govemance is inherently an ac
tive process, not a passive one. Its
existence is validated only when we
actively participate. We cannot sell
ourselves short by accepting policies
thatwe do notagree with. lfwc failto
actively question our surroundings,
then we have, in effect, submitted
into acceptance. This is not in accor»
dance with the philosophy of self
goverrtance.

It is very easy to confront a prob-
lem. The activity must take place
through the means of consciousness-
raising (an active process of qucs—
tioning) and policy proposals. We
must actively question administra»

Matt
Stippich

tors,faculty,professorsandourselves.
In doing so, we are not only finding
answers for ourselves, but we are
increasing the consciousness of the
community.

I think we are all excited about the
arrival of our new President, Pam
Ferguson. There are changes that are
likely to take place over the course of
this new administration; changes that

that we. m students, must be particu
larly sensitive to our surroundings.
We mustnotonlyraise newquestions
about policy reform, but we must

show our approval of areas that we

what welike and don’t like. They will

I would like to close by explaining
SGA’s role in the sclf-goveming pro-
cess. SGA is anoutletofinfonnation.
It is our duty to provide the campus
with information about what is hap-
pening. We will make iteasy for you
to raise questions, because we will
provide you with the information.
Through senators, open forums and
study breaks, SGA will be empower-
ing the student body with the ability
to raise questions. In return, all SGA
asks is that the student body provide
an opinion. SGA has student reprer

THE
GLASS

Attention fresh. uh,
first-year students

This is my ﬁrst column, and I
thought it might be nice to start with
asortof freshperson orientation thing.

The first thing you must know to
be a proper Grinnell student is simple:
GET USED TO HYPOCRISY. At
such a “liberal" college, you might
get the impression that the student
body at large is open»minded. Au
contraire. mon amil We here at
Grinnell pride ourselves on our “po-
litical correctness," which basically
means we must resuict our speech to
exclude all un»pc phrases. I know
what you’re thinking—"Elisa,”
you‘re saying, “how is it possible to
be open-minded and yet restrict our
thoughts and language at the same
time?" Exactly. It sounds goofy, but
get used to it.

(Now some of you may be think-
ing, “Geez, that Elisa sure is a bigot.
not grooving on political correctness
and all," Well, I’m not. ljustbelieve
in freedom of speech. and that means
taking the bad with the good.)

The second thing to know is GET
OUT OF YOUR ROOM, This is es-
pecially important for those ofyou in
overcrowded situations. Most of you
have ﬁgured this out by now, seeing
as how we’ve been here almost a
whole three weeks. However, for
those of you who rcmain locked in
your cells,Iofferthisadvice: go hang
outata Ham's Center party forafcw
minutes. You’ll notice people leav-
ing in droves—follow one of these
groups. You’ll either ﬁnd yourself at
The Bar or ataswell game ofTrivial
Pursuit. loin in. It’ll be fun. Either
way, you'll make some new friends.

The third thing is FORGET
ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL, The only
time you're legally allowed to talk
about high school is when you‘re
talking aboutall the bone-head things
you did way back then. No one wants
tohearabouthow coolyouwere,how
much fun you had at the Math Olym-
pics, or how hot your prom date was,
lnstead,reminisce aboutthe time you

were in the lunch room, and you
spilledachocolate milkshakeonyour
bmndrspankin’ new Replacements T-
shirt. Or the time you were in gym
playingdodgeballandyourowntcam
turned on you. Or how ‘bout the time
you fell asleep in German class and
you started snoring so loud theFrench
class down the hall came over and
asked you to please keep it down,
because they‘re taking a test to deter-
mine their French-speaking ability,
die results of which will haunt them
for the rest oftheir lives? Try to keep
everything in perspective.
Thefourthpointis shortandsweei:
NEVER LOSE YOUR SENSE OF
HUMOR. You‘renever too mature to

Elisa
Martin

laugh at a fart joke or snicker at the
phrase “I goua pee.“

The fifth andmostimportantthing
is to remember this: WE WERE ALL
GEEKS AT SOME POINT. I don’t
care if it was way back in 1974 when
your mom dressed you in those red,
blue, and black plaid bell-bottoms
and the bright, blinding yellow
sweatshirt with your name printed in
purple letters, or if it was your senior
year of high school when. despite
your college-preparatory classes and
intense workvethic. the only job you
could get was ticket-taker at the local
multi-plex. WE WERE ALL GEEKS.
If you deny it, you’re lying to your-
self.

So there you go. I sincerely hope
that this little “guide to fresh life" has
been somewhat helpful. You’re be-
ginning a new phase in your life—a
time when you’re away from mom
and dad, but (for most of you) they’re
still paying the bills. You‘d better be
grateful for this fact.

Hey, maybe some non-first-year
students will read this and take a clue
or two,
