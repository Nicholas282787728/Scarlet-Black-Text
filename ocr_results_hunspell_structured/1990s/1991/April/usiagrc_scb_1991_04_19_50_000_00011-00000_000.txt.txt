Grinnell, playing in the BB divi-
sion with 16 other teams, sent only
six players

On Saturday, the group faced
the most difficult pool which in-
cluded teams from Graceland Col-
lege and the University ofNorthem
Iowa. Still, Grinnell managed to
emerge as one of the two teams
from the pool to advance to the
playoff rounds on Sunday.

Soviet team to play area high
school all-star team in Darby

Area basketball fans are in for a
troatTuesday. Apri123 an. 30 when
Grinnell College hosts a game be
tween area high school youth and a
SovietUn ion district team.Tickets.
priced at 53.00, are available
through area high school coaches
and players, or at Darby gym on

Players from 12 high school
teams make up the roster. Coaches
Steve Kriegcl of Grinnell, Larry
Hetcher of South Tama and Al
Rabenold of Montezuma will lead
the lA-member squad. David
Arseneault,GrinnellCollegecoach
and former Canadian international
player, will give instruction on in-
tomational rules and competition

The Soviet Union team hails
from the districtofStavrapol, which
has been a sister state to Iowa since
June 17, 1988. The district,localed
in the southwest USSR near the
Black Sea, is comprised of22cities
and towns, 34 rural subdisﬂ'icls and
over 900 smaller rural settlements

In 1990 12 Stavropol coaches
and athletes competed in the Drake
Relays to mark the first formal
sports competition between the sise
ter states. Numerous exchanges by
educators and students have OC-
curred since the relationship was
established.

Arseneault commented, “Grin-
nell College is proud to host the
game. When national teams come
to theU.S. they are very serious and
competitive. The Soviets typically
play a 17371 zone defense and pos-
sess good three-point shooting
ability. Intemational play is also
more physical." The coach predicts
the arealeam will have to full-court

Last weekend's State meet rained out

By Jessica Henry

Meet or no meet? That was U‘le
big question asked prior to last
Saturday’s meet. TheState meet to
be held at Buena Vista was can-
celled as a result of the torrential
downpours which struck Iowa last
weekend. In the end, nine tmckr
men travelled to what was dubbed
Coe’s “Spur of the Moment" Meetr

The weather conditions seemed
to bejust right for distance events.
3 distance runners proved this in
the SK: Chris Garmatt ran 15:09
followed by David Hammond
(15:33) and MikeNawrock‘i (15:37).
The weather did not hurt triple-
jumper Jeff Wilson either, Wilson
scored a personal best with ajump
of 40’6".

Now the Pioneer men are gear-
ing up for the only home meet. the
Grinnell/DeLong Classic. It looks
