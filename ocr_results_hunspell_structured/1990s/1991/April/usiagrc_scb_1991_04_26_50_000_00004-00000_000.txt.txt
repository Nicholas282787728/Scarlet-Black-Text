Just don’t do it: the
costs of vandalism

In chpril12issuc.iltc.fcarlelrtrtdﬂlack printedn letter from a group
of students conccmod about vandalism on campus. The authors of the
letter pointed specifically at those who damage and steal property while
drunk or stoned and described Such behavior as "stupid” and "immature.“
Perhaps everyone would use different aioclives to characterize alcohol/
drug-induced vandalism, butalmosi everyone would agree that not only
is it illegal, it is totally illogical and without purpose,

Last Friday night, a party in a North Campus dorm developed into an
early morning bout of hurling lounge lumiiure into the wall, smashing
tables and breaking glass. Those who damaged the lounge have notcome

forward,and whileStudentAffairs

damaged, dorm residenu await the
potentially sizeable deduction from
their continuing enrollment funds.

Obviously, this is not the first incidentofvandalism at a party, nor will
it be the last. The glass in dorm doors is broken regularly, and there are
often various intriguing remnants of "the night before" left around
campus. Such weekend reminders will probably never cease completely.
but as the letter of two weeks ago pointed out. those who indulge should
think before they act. What is the purpose ofbreaking glass or damaging
furniture? What is left will only be there tomorrow, and that includes
spilled beer and vomit.

it is unrealistic, and admittedly. unpleasant, to clean up after a party
while one is still dnink. itis even more unpleasant toclean up the nextday,
especially ifone was not a part of the festivities. the answer is simple:
don't do it. It is possible to have fun. drunk or sober, without damaging
anything. Because whatever is damaged, someone will have to pay. for
it. And don't we already pay enough?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Leder challenges column

To the editor,

Mike Washburn’s April 19 coir
tlmn “On Pride Week" is it naive,
Wrongrhcadod and cynical attempt
to discredit the organizers and par
ticipants in Gay/Lesbian Pride
chk activities. Failures of logic
and stnoldering intolerance rcndcr

assumes Ilial Gay/Lesbian Pride

a movement for “special entich
merits." Close bchind this error is

tries to discredit without any refer-
ence to the long-term flow of social
justice in our country.

in addition to harboring false-
hoods. Washburn's opinion piece
reeks of intolerance and
cynicismiie implicitly and inex-
plicably dcfendsgayrbashcrs(“It's
‘fzishionzible’ these days to attack
prejudice against gays") as if there
were any time in America when it
would be inappropriate to attack
such prejudice. Is not tolerance for
diversity a fundamental American
trait?

Intolerance is rarely far from

anceof gays and lcsblltns, a wrong

Washburn’s logic strikes out
when he Lrics to find a contradiction
between the pursuit ofcqliiilily un»

Bar stajf
appeals to
students

To the editor,

We walk down at the Bar and
have been doing soconsistcntly for
a year. We know that those who are
Barregularsarc awareotwhathap.
pcncd toTrey, buiive would like to
tell thcrcstotihecampus. Several
weeks ago at about two o'clock on
aFridlty morning,Troy wasdriving
to visit his parents in Montezuma.
went over the side of the road and
rolled his car end ever end. Be-
cause of that accident, he is now
paralyzed from the neck down.

We, as employees or the Bar
are concerned for him. What we
are asking of the students of Grins
nell is to help Troy by donating
money to him in his money jar
down atthe Bar. From this money.
we have been buyingcards, iiowers
and posters to show oursupport for
him. If you get the chance. come
down to the Bar and donate money
torTroy. What we know rightnow
is lhztt'froy broke his neck and has
some movement in his arms; he is
in Iowa Methodist Hospital in Des
Moincs.

Well, we hope the students who
cometotheBarwillrespectlastcall
and will make a more concerted
effort to leave BEFORE two
O'clock.

Martin defends computer plan

To the editor,

I am writing this in response to
last week's column dubiously en-
litled “The Real World." I usually
agrcelhat to respond inthis manner
is the stuff of which rubber spines
are made. But. in this instance I
muSt ignore the hetterjudgment of
myself and my friends, relatives
and (Lo-workers.

I am not responding to my writ-
ing in question. innocence is in no
need of a defense. I would like to
merely challenge all those who sit
in Lhe dark comers of churches all
day reading plans in Search of of-
fensive and harassing material. 1
challenge you to read the plan of
every student that has one. I simir
larly challenge you to read the lit-
eratureon the bathroom stallsin the
Burling basementlavotalorics.You
shall ﬁnd offensive and hamssing
material galore. and it shall sale
you ad infinitum.

When PresidentEiscnhower was
criticized for not responding to
McCarthy’s vicious, malevolent
aitackson iormcr Secretary orSiatc
Georcharshall,herespontlcd that

he “just didn’t want to get into a
pissing contest with that skunk."I
have no desue tosink down intothe
gutter. Buti shall not be punished
for any wrongdoing.

I am not out to harass anyonel
never sent people my plan or sent
disparaging compuicr mail,us oth-
ershavcrecently done.it was there
forpublic pcnisal,butitwas forced
down noone’sgullct.lfoncdoesn't
care to see it, it is not seen.

My plan has been in existence
since the month prior to Spring
Break. It has not been "offensive"
and "harassing" until recently. The
lists came later. as did the charges
of “offensive harassment.” Some
have tried to interpret the meaning
of my plan; since I wrote it, [know
its meaning. such speculators are
overruledl

It I truly wanted to harass any
one, I could easily be more effi-
crent. I can perform simple tasks.
but that one I had no desire to air
tempt. l was stating my opinion of
some people, as comics and critics
ofvztnous varietiesdocousistently,
i understand those who disagree
with what I wrote; I rigorously be-

lieve in Vollaire’s idea of defend-
ing to the death one’s right to say
so.Buthillnotbecensoredformy
opinions.Thcpurposcoflheplan is
so that the author can write any-
thing. i made no derogatory rer
marks against anyonc's religion,
race, ethnic origin, gentler, or taste
in music, nor would i ever do so.
Freedom of speech must be cut-
utilctlwithtn dieserights,andlhztve
done so. Any curtailing outside
these basic grounds is censorship.
The student Handbook might say
thatIamguiltyofharassment.ifso,
then i am guilty of breaking an
ambiguous and unjust law. I am
painrully aware that my response
might jeopardize my graduation
from Gnnnell,but I shall notstand
silent while i am punished prejudi-
cially, indiscriminately, and dis-
gustingly roranywrongdoing. Such
punishment is illegal by my stan—
dards ofjuslice. If Grinncll truly is
the bastion of liberal ideals that it
purports to be, it should be proven
in this matter.
