Joint Board offers
constitutional,
bylaw changes

By Craig Wacker

Joint Board recently discussed
scvcral changes to bolh Lhc bylaws
and constitution of lhc Student
Government Association. The al-
terations were raised at a constitu-
lional convenLion held last Thurs-
day.

According to SGA President
Pedro Femandcz-McCarthy, the
two mostsigniﬁcantchanges to the
constitution involved the inclusion
ofsections which had been removed
from previous constitutions.
Fernandez-McCarthy mentioned
that sections dealing wilh die im-
pcachment of senators and the Stu-
dent Council on Curriculum had
been absent from recent constitu»
tions. The changes have already
been approved by a two thirds mar—
gin in the most recent Joint Board
meeting. According to Femandcz-
McCarlhy the changes to the con-
stitution must be approved by a
sixty percent margin in a general
campus referendum. The campus
will vote regarding the proposed
changes on Wednesday May 1.

Thejustiﬁcation for eliminating
the Parliamentarian, according to
Femandez-McCarthy, was related
to the “strange marriage" between
the Parliamentarian and the Stu-
dent Group Liaison. Fernandez.
McCarthy added that the role of
Parliamentarian had become less
useful {or recent Joint Board meet-
ings. Disputes on parliamentary
procedure, said Fernandez-
McCathy, can be settled by Joint
Board without the presence of a
Parliamenlarian.

The Student Rules and Politics
Committee has also been dissolved
due to its obsolescence.

Unlike the CDnsu'tuLion, changes
in the bylaws must only be ap-
proved by Joint Board in two con-
secutive meetings. Joint Board has
