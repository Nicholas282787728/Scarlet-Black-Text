until the arrival of President-elect
Pamela Ferguson. Ferguson atr
tended meetings with the commit-
tee last weekend, and she empha-
sized the need for multiculturalism
atGrinnell.“We’renotserving stu-
dents well if we're not preparing
them for the twenty-ﬁrst century,"
she said. “We have to focus on
multiculturalismbccauscthatisthc
future.”

Steven Jones. Associate Dean
of Student Affairs, agreed that
multiculturalism is importantin all
areas of the college—the cun'icur
lum. admissions. retention and stu-
dent life. “The college is looking at
its development in the area of
multiculturalismAhow we can de-
velop all areas of the institution7
not just students. not just faculty,“
he said. “We‘ll have a greater suc—
cess late if we focus on these areas
in unison. Recruitment and reten-
tion. for example. can never be
separated from one another."

Cun‘ently, Grinnell employs six

administrators of color; of the ten
mulLi-ethnic faculty. there are five
Asian Americans, four African
Americans and one Latino. Nine
percent or the student body are
American students of color. and ten
percent are intemational students.
lodi Hester. Assistant Director and
Coordinator of Multicultural Re-
eruiunent, said that the numbers of
multi-ethnic applicants have in
creased for next year‘s class.

Members of the Mulli-Ethnic
Coalition were also present at the
weekend meetings. The organiza-
tion stressed the imponance of an
ethnic studies department, both in
attracting students to Grinnell and
in promoting diversity throughout
the campus.“We have active reser—
vations about drawing students
here," said Marie Myers. “Grinnell
needs more tangible consistency in
promoting a multicultural commu-
nity."

AdrienneMcAdoryagreed.“We
have to show there‘s real effort
here. You have to offer something
more than increased numbers of
students of color,”

New dorm faces delay

By Daniel Bliss

A delay in the construction of
the proposed new dorm is likely,
following the rejection by the trust-
ees of the New Residence Hall
Planning Committee's original rec-
ommendations. The committee
discussed'l'tiursdayatrusteerequest
to reduce the size and cost of the
building, and alter its appearance
and location. Construction. which
wasplannedbyarchittxtl-lerbStone
to begin in the fall, could now be
delayed until next spring, or even
later if the trustees decide not to
press ahead with the protect

The biggest changes were no»
oessitated by cost considerations
and concern the size and interior
design of the building, ”the com-
mitteerecommendedareductionin
accomodation from 96 students to
80. accounted for by a reduction in
the number of singles. in addition
the proposed resident adviser
apartmenthas been axed. However,
the building will have a ratio of
singles to doubles srmilurto that in
most other residencc halls, and the
sixfour-room triples remain largely
intact in the new plan.

Furthcrrecommendationsofthe
trustees accepted by the committee

were a plainer design for the build-
ing wtth loss external glass, and a
slight change in the building's lo-
cation This will involve moving
the building around 50 ftnearer 8th
Avenue, which will free the popu-
lar space in front of South Loose
andRead Halls,accordingtoStone.
The trusices also requested the
committee consider alternatives to
the construction of a new dorm.
such as the conversion of pit lounges
into student rooms and allowing
more students to live off-campus.
But Dean of Student Affairs
Tom Crady suggested that this plan
would be difficult to implement.
Only 154 students are planning to
live off-campus next year. a reduc»
Lion of 26 on this year's number,
and Presrdent Drake has ruled outa
reduction in enrollment. As a result.
the college faces a serious worsens
ing of the overcrowding problem
next year. according to Crady. The
committee recommended that con-
eruction of a new dorln would be
the best solution to overcrowding.
Butaccording toCrady and Stonea
delay in consuuction could be un-
avoidable because of the magnir
tude of the suggested design
changes and the length of the deci-
sion making process.

$780,000. the Bowen Hall rcmoda
cling will be funded primarily by
the NSF grant and a $328,000 gift
from the estate of Dyre Pelletier, a
1930 graduate ofGtinnell College.
The remodeling project is schedr
uled to begin in August 1992, and
will be completed a year later. die
