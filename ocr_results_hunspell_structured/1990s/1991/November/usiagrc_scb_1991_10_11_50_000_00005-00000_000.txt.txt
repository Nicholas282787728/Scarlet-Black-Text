people own those darn shoes? Well, we did, and decided to use the non-random sample of students supping at

to “The Quad Poll ofthe Day." Not wanting to hoard th

:Adams hopes to educate campus about
rmental illness through the PheoniX

By Karin Bellomy
John Adams is a paranoid schizo»

' phrenic. His mental illness, and his

having been the victim of harassr
merit, prompted him to start a new
mental illness support and informa-

4 Lion group on campus called thePhoe-

DIX.

Adams‘s group hasatwo»fold goal.
First. Adams,asophomore,lendssup-
port one-on-one to people who have,
or are personally affected by some-
onewho has, a mental illness. Healso
provides information at meetings for
thoseinterested in learning more about
mental illnesses.

Such information could clear up
incorrect assumptions people might
haveabout mental illness, said Adams.

' For instance. many people believe

that multiple personality disordersand
schizophrenia are the same illness.
and this “is a myth I wish would be
dispelled,"said Adams,citinghis own
experience thatmostpeople react with
shock when they discover that he has
schizophrenia.

“Norman Bates [the multiplevper-
sonality character from the movie
‘Psycho'] stans mnning through their
heads," said Adams.

So far the group has attracted 12
people who range from depressive to

videos to show at the meetings from
the Clubhouse, an organization in
town which harbors the mentally ill
and is associated with the Mental
Health Center.

Although schizophreniatsgenetic.
some kind of external event must
trigger it in order for it to affect the
carrier. Paranoid schizophrenics ex
hibit both “positive" and “negative“
symptoms. Positive symptoms in-
clude hallucinations, which can be
auditory, visual or olfactory; delu-
sional thinking;and thesensation that
foreign objects, such as marbles, are
inhabiting the schizophrenic’s body.

Negative symptoms, on the other
hand. are not quite so “colorful," said
Adams. One symptoms is apathy: the

other. called the “flat effect," is the
inability to express emotion.

Although some new medications
thatconuolboth thepositiveandnega—
rive symptoms of schizophrenia have
“apparently” entered the market. said
Adams, most medications used to
control schizophrenia generally bring
out the negative symptoms.

“Most drugs focus on [getting rid
of] positive symptoms since they’re
the more devastating ones." Adams
explained.

Penny Cahill, a big name in the
field of research on schizophrenia,
will come to Grinnell from the Uni
versity of Iowa to speak about this
illness on October 16 at 7:30 pm. in
South Lounge.

Rainbow Lobby works
to broaden politics

By Chris Maag

Two national leaders of the Rain~
bow Lobby VisitedGrinnell lastweek
to give talks and meet with faculty in
order to rouse support for their
grassroots organization. Deborah
Green, the political director, and
Bonny Gildin, Grinnell alum of the
class of ‘75 and current fund raising
director for the lobby, talked to stu-
dents at the Fomm about the election
process in the United States.

“We, as a group. are concerned
with Lhenarrowing ofpolitical debate
and the tight control the dominant
political parties have over the elec7
tion process," said Green.

The lobby, founded in 1984. con—
cems itself mainly with issues of de-
mocracy in the US. and abroad and
widening the scope of political de-
bate. Itcurrentlyfocuses on widening
the two-party system to allow third-
party candidates to play a more imi
portantrolein Ameticanpolitics,and
believes the Democratic and Repubr
lican parties have too much control
over elections and political debate.

Both women say that the group
tries to remain as separated from ac-
tual issue debates as possible. They
haveonoccasionchosensidesinsuch
debates. butaccording toGildin, these
instances “have all been connected
with the idea of helping improve de~
hate in democracies."

To illustrate the need for more
debate and public involvement in
American politics, Green cited re-
sults of a recent Kettering Foundation
poll that indicates the American elec-
torate is not as apathetic as is com-
monly believed. but rather have sub~
stituted local civic duty for political
duty because they see more chances
for these efforts to bring change,

To stop this process of alienation,
theRainbowlobbysuggeststhatelec-

Lion laws and rules governing na-
tional debates should be changed to
let more third-party candidates enter
elections, and nationally televised
debates shouldn’t be controlled by
the two dominant parties.

“The people have real ideas and
real concerns that are not being ad—
dressedand should notbeforcedinto
having a smaller and smallernumber
of political choices." said Green.

Campus members of the two mar
jorpoliticalpartieshelddifferentopin-
ions than the Rainbow Lobby about
elections and debates in America.

“I was impressed by her speech,
and Iagreedwith heron some points,”
saidCampusRepublicanchairTrevis
Parson, “But I‘m not in favor of a
huge ballot with hundreds of names
on it - the whole system would be too
confusing for the voters. I’m also not
sure whether a major third party is
really needed right now.”

"The lobby has many good ideas
about freer debates and freer elec-
tions, butl don't really think that their
programs would be as effective as
some others,“ said Sarah Purcell. a
member of the Campus Democrats.
She added that she agrees with the
need for a third political party.

At the present, both Green and
Gildin said their movement is “just a
pip-squeak, grassroots lobby that’s
working outside the system.“ They
claim, however, that both working
outside the party system and gaimng
most of their members through face-
tofacecontacthavemadetheirlobby
stronger and more able to effect the
kind of changes for which they are
working.
