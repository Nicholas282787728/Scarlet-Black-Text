Volleyball
continues
ups and
downs

By Grey Gardner

The Volleyball Club enjoyed a
day of ups and downs on Saturday
in the premier showing of its two
teamstogether. Both teams travelled
to Marshalltown to participate in
theweekly U.S.V.B.A.tournnmont.
Yet, this competition proved to be
slightly different fortheclub. Both
teams played one level above their
respective classifications. The
older, more experienced‘BB” team.
advanced to the “A" level and dis-
covered an entirely improved de-
gree of competition.

The “B" learn opened its season
at the Marshalltown tournament
having to play in tJte“EE” division
due to scheduling conflicLs. Even
though most of these players had
never before competed in a formal
volleyball competition, they
showed incredtblepoisc throughout
each match. This was clearly evi-
denced by their narrow defeat to a
highly talented and experienced
lowa Stale team.

Although the club only experi-
enced one victory throughout the
day, both teams exhibited immense

the masses of mean, muscled ath-

Despite the intense competition, it
was a happy day for several of the
Grinnell athletes. Guy Potter, still
on a mad dash since his return from
Yugoslavia, tore his way through
the 800 meter, running a 1:57.
Sophomore Darren Young de-
stroyed yet a few more school

deﬁnite, of course , but with the
team's strengths the possibility is
there. If the Grinnell men do not
steal massive amounts of points at
the state meet, you can be sure they
will cut loose at the Conference
meet the next weekend.

on Saturday for dual matches
against both Drake Univeisity and
the Universityof Iowa varsity team.
