The Indigo Girls credit
their success on the hopeful mes-
sage of their music.

“it's about. going through
the the dark parts of life in order to
come to terms with things in the
end...we t’tnd hope in the humane
ness of things," said Saliers.

Due to their popularity,
the Indigo Girls have been in great

get the band to come to Grinnell,

"It was luck. They wanted to play a
small Iowa school, and we outbid
Cornell College for them.”

about the cost of the performance,
explained, “We wanted Io bring in

PRETTY LITTLE BAKA GUY/LIVE IN OSAKA

The band Shonerl Knife is composed of three Japanese
women, who play catchy popvpunk songs that touch on the basics
of life: food, animals, summertime, laziness. and public bathing.

This album, their second domestic release, is a re-relcasc of
two earlier recordings. The studio side is great. Among numerous
other hits, it includes the classic Bear Up Bison, in which Shonen
Knife sing, “We‘re only making plans for the dirty dirty bison] he
has a right to live though he’s ill—shaped!" The live side is weaker,
suffering from bad production quality.

Nevertheless, this is a fine musical offering - it‘s fresher,
funnier and less selfeconscious than most Indie rock records. And
where else can you hear “Suzy is a Headbanger" sung with a

There are two reasons why I’d like to describe this selfrtitlcd
debut album as “REM being chased by a drunken Hank Williams
with a stetunrollcr, while a laughing Ted Nugent looks on.” First, it
sounds like something you might read in Spin, and secondly,
because it’s a very appealing image.

Superchunk, however, would be better described as dino»
saur-inspircd guitar rock. They are not the greatest example ofthat
sub-genre, as they lack both originality and personality.

On theothcr hand, thisalbum hnsgreal guilarhooks a-plenty,
and the music is played with lungejzirring intensity.

I guess it’s a toss-up as to whether the album IS good or bad.

l-lold on...heads - it‘s good.
