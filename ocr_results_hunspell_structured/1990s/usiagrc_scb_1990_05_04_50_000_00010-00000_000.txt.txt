PROPAGANDA: Issues

One side attempts to appeal to our
religious nature, talking about the
soul of the unbom. The other side
tnes to persuade our sense ofcivie
duty and a social ethic, explaining
aboutoverpopulatienand theplight
of the child born to a mother who
does not want it. Rarely will one
side respond to the other with
anything but a few hisses and cat
calls. I should pointout, however,

Yes Rob, you were the target of
“unfair, uninformed, excla-
mation-point ridden slurs," and it
was good that you defended
yourselfagainst this. ' But to turn
aroundanddothcsametosomeone
else is unforgivable. I hope you
can realize what a mistake you
have made, not only as SGA

President, but also as a fellow
human being.

If not, to paraphtase a now-
famous quote, I have worked with
ScottTruesdell. Ihavetalked many
times with Scott Truesdell. I have
lived with Scott Tmesdell. in this
matter, Rob, you' have certainly
proven that you are no Scott

that there is one redeeming quality
ofgroupson bothsides oftliisissne:
they are willing to engage in public
debate. While these debates often
breakdown,atlcastlhewtllingnoss
to talk is there. These sorts of
debates alleviate some of the
propaganda by giving people the
chance to hear both sides.

Lastly, we have the use ofpropav
ganda to sway public opinion on
international issues. The plight of
someone, somewhere, and how we
should feel about it. Most recently
on this campus such propaganda
was used with regard to a set of
filmsaboutthesituation of thePale-
stinians in Israel, sponsored by the
Palestinian Human Rights Council
ofGrinncll. These films used many
of the tactics of emotional appeals
and halftruths,along with powerful
images to sway opinion.

if you have a moment, be it here
or wherever you go for thesummer,
take a moment and examine your
opinions. Think about where you
gained your information, and
whether or not you have ever taken
a moment to really listen to the
otherside. Itisimportanttoengage
in debate as a vehicle for a full
understanding of issues. Granted,
this may not change your opinion
on anythingbutit mayaltow all of
to have a more peaceful world.

INTERVIEW:
Erroneous Opinions
on Popcorn, Chew,
and Hugs Revealed

continued from page 9

As for the performance itself,
wecan place any blameon Darby’s
acoustics(secondinquality only to
an ATM machine), the band‘s lack
of congeniality (again, akin to an
ATMmachine's—both'lltakeyour
money, but only one says please)
and WAY TOO MUCH VOCAL
in the soundsystem. Not thatitwas
all bad. Freshman Chris Rossow
noted “You could hear it all per-
fectly down in the bathroom.”
Yeah, but the view isn‘t as compel»
ling.

And speaking of compelling
views, how ‘bout the little how-to
section leading into De La‘s song
“Jennifa.” So you really can do
more with your hips than hang a
belt on ‘cm. Damned if they‘re
gonna teach us THAT in Grin-
nell’s Marxist-ridden curriculum.
The littlekids up front loved it, too.
it made them squeal.

We didn‘t exactly interview the
band. Posdnuos looked like he’d
rather hit us titan answer any ques
tions. Sowebotheredolhers. Wells

Congratulations Seniors and Departing Faculty
Members - You will be sorely missed! See the

rest of you next year.

ltke that) Stanley Posovich thought
itwasa”good,quietshow." Which
probably means noonc gotdroppt’d
on a sixth grader. Another Pnso
vich, whose name we forget be-
cause our tape-recorder is evil. also
answeredourquestions. Shethinks
smokeless tobacco is “just as dan-
gerous as the real thing." With
prompting, she said the same of
microwave popcorn. but admits to
using it. Probably not while on
duty, though. She also said hug»
therapy was “good for everyone."
Except maybe Pos. with his copy-
righted (honest) Madface.

Q-tip, rapper for opening band
A Tribe Called Quest, also thinks
hug therapy is “good for anger.”
Whatever. Mr. Tip talked to us
while hcshotbasketsafter theshow.
We learned, for instance, that his
own favorite breakfast was blue-
berry pancakes, tattoos were “paid
ful,"andthatmicrowavepopcom=
“death.” Sort of hard to follow, you
say?

That wasn‘tdieleastof it. Tribe
member Q-tip also admitted to dis-
liktng, no rather “not being able to
stand enchiladas," quite a scoop in
light of the pivotal role enchiladas
play in his band‘s song “Left My
Wallet In El Segundo.”

Anyone else confused? We
were, but confusion seemed to be
the rule on Peace Day. For in-
stance, why does 7'2" reggae-guy
Eek»a»Mouse wear shoes that make
himjustthatmuch more taller,and
why do some college students inv
sist on \veartng no shoes at all in
crowds?

Just why did some people decide
that Peace Day meant Keg Races
followed by Armageddon in front
of the libmry for the whole world,
and especially Dean Cindy, to see.
Others seemed to feel that Peace
Day to them meantsquashing grade
scltoolers in between the crowd and
the stage.

Just what is a Plug-One and why
are they “Whack”.7 Why did the
soundtech guys figure we needed
vocals that drowned out the music?
Do the two security guards named
Posovitch also go by the nickname
“P05”? And just what did Qrtip
meanby saying thatKentuekyFricd
Chicken "used to be good but has
lost clientele”?

Who knows.

The perfect Peace Day, just
like peace itself, remains elusive.
But even if apathetic Rap groups
and scat singing Reggae bands
aren’t your thing, you‘ve got to
admit, nobody ever tossed daisies
to the crowd at any Blues or acous-
tic guitarconccrtonly to have them
tossed back. Or shook their pelvis
for Peace, either. At least, not like
that.
