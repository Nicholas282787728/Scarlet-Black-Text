Silence = death (or at least ignorance)

I’ll be honest; Ilove language. It
is to me one of the human races'
crowning achievements. It allows
us to record our greatest and worst
moments. as well as to argue and
discussforthepursuitofknowledge.
It is a tool by which we are able to
build our minds in a way which
would be impossible if it did not
exist.

At Grinnell, however, language
is nota tool, it is aweapon: it has all
the subtlety and grace of a Scud
missilein flight. Asfor its use in the
pursultofargument,atGrinnellthis
ability seems still-boni.We,using
labels and double talk, have turned
words into stakes and crucified
ourselves with them. -

LanguageatGrlnncll has lostits
true purpose. No longer do weseek
to use language and its subtleties to
discuss and learn; rather, we use it
like a lead pipe to either pound our
opinions into people's heads, or at
the very least to cow them into
silence. We have created labels
which carry with them suchahcavy
price that few of us have the cour-
age to take them on. In effect,
George Orwell‘s double-speak is
notsome myth oflhe distantfuture.
but rattler it is the fact of now. Four

very short decades ago, it you be.

licvod in such radical things as
sexual equality or personal liberty,
you were labeled a Communist by
the McCartltyi’sis. If you any way
deviated from the norm, if it was
because you refused to recognize
the evils of the red devils, or if you
weresimplyahomosexual,youllad
a label slapped on you, and your
fate was sealed. Very few people

other than Jesse Helms would refer
to those as the good old days. The
truth, however, is that nothing’s
changed.

Al Grinnell the shoe is on the
other foot. Ifyou voted for Bush or
againstilagbumingyouareayoung
fascist. If you are against affirmtir
live action you are labeled by many
as aracist. If you are either pro-life
(oranLi-abortion, oranu-choice) you
are simply beyond the pale all [Or
gether. They arc, all and all, some
pretty heavy scarlet letters to throw
around so lightly. In reality, how-
ever,itis simpiyfear, The fear is of
argument, of rational logical dis-
cussion, and of the fact one might
have to admit that someone clsc’s
opinion is valid.

It is in fact far easier to label
people's Views or argue about the
words they userathcr then confront
the very real issues which face us.
Confronting issues takes bravery:
it requires getting into the mud,
often on your hands and knees, and
often only by doing thiscan we_find
solutions. It is far easier to argue
about if you are pro-life or and
choice than it is to face the very real
issueofabortion, and people’s very
real moral problems with the issue.
Similarly, it is easier to pick apart
the etymology of the word antir
Semitism then it is to confront the
hatred which Jews are faced with.
So we twist words to suit our pur-
poses and put the emperor in new
clothes. lfsomeone we approve of

hates, we simply rename his emo-
tion dngcr.'lhedifferencesbetween
the two words’ meanings is imma-
tcrial: all that matters is the emo-
tions we wish to convey. So, as we
complain about the military‘s der
scriptlon of dead human beings as
Collateral damage. we twist lan-
guage with the same gusto. At the
same time, we manipulate words,
renamingihtngsovcrandoveragutn
to fit some surrealistic notion of
politically correct. Terms change,
overandoveragain,becomingpcr-
pctually more bland. After years of
discomfort with terms for various
peoples, we at Inst settle on "people
of color." Those of us who were
once simply "while," are now of
European descent. I‘m sure it is

"pigmcnlally impaired."

with every turn of phrase we
further destroy and misuse lan-
guage. That ability, speech, which
is our best hope of solving prob-
lems withoul bloodshed, becomes
somethingwesimplycowerbehttld.
The time has come to come out
from behind our shield and throw
away thesecurity blanket. We have
reformed language and now must
admit that this is only a step. The
time has come to realize that we
cannot simply attempt to label
people away, rather than coniront
theissucswhich they represent. The
time has come to stop thinking that
language revision can completely
onto our social problems. In the
simplest terms, the time has come
to leave our intellectual umbrellas
behind, and walk outside in the
very real rain.

Fighting back--the constructive way

Pedro
Fernandez-
McCarthy

Recently, I was reminded of
something thathappened to me that
I’djustas soon forgetilnlanuaryof
last year, I was walking home from
The Bar after spending time with
friends of mine who had returned
from studying abroad. As I turned
east on Fifth Avenue, I heard
someone whisperloudly: “Hey. Hey
you . . ."I looked towards the direc-
tion ofthe voice and saw a slightly
chubby man in his mid to late
twenties holding up his right hand.
He was too far away, and it was
much too dark for me to see him
clearly. I looked away. As I drew
nearer, I heard the same person
who, as he was giving me the
“finger" while sporting a sardonic
smileonhis face,say:“l{ey, faggot,
I’m talking to you.” Again, I looked
away. I walked past him. I didn’t

run, but I did pick up my pace.
Then, I was grabbed by my
shoulder,spunar0und and punched
in the stomach. The person then
quickly raised his leg and was pretty
damned close to krieeing me in the
groin. Ididn’tthink. I was too scared
for that. Isimpty grabbed the leg,
held it tight. and returned the favor

with my right leg. I heard an
“oomph,“ and the man fell to the
ground. I was shaking. I just left
him there and ran away. I was still
trembling when I got back to my
dorm. I went into the bathroom,
lifted up my shrrtandnoticeda very

COMMON SENSE
The silence of the doves

Must opposition to the war was
somewhat subdued, at least in
comparison to the protests during
the heady ycttrsof Vietnam. Strident
dissent manifested inTimes Square
mobs which have thrown a few
garbagccansand madea good deal
of noise, in a teeming march in
Washington, and in sizable rallies
in Middle Eastern clues, but with
these exceptions Mr. Bush's came
paign against the Butcher of
Baghdudhussofartailcdtofomcnt
anything like the level of public
outrage that attended the Indochina
conflict. Certainly, this isa relief: I
know that if 1 were in the desert
with our Lroops,l\vou1d take IitLIc
comfort from hordes of anti-war
demonstrators damning as unjust
and immoral the cause for which I
might lose my life and burning thc
flag of the country for which I wtls
lighting. Without the feeling that
my own country supported me, my
death,ifitc2ime,wouldbcpoinlless
and ignoble.

Though they are often romantii
Oiled, American anti~war demon-
strations have not only served to
erode the morale ofour troops, but
have also been marked by selfish
hypocrisy. While their ostensible
objective has been “peace,” pro-
testers havo been motivated at least
partly by an unwillingness to risk
their lives by serving their country
in war. In the early seventies there
were massive antirwar rallies on
the Boston Common, in one of
which 100,000 people participated,
PresidenlNixon declared that 1973
wouldseetheendoftlledraft.Thcn.
after this declaration, another rally
was held on the Commoniwcll-
publicized in advance, and ata time
when the fighting in Vietnam was
as fierce and bloody as ever—and
how many showed up? A pidriling
10,000. Other demonstrations
around the country were smaller
thanthosebeforeNixonannounccd
that the draft would be shortrlivcd.
Allwenresayingisdo notdraft us.

I’m not claiming that a desire
not to serve was the only motive of
the protesters. Numbers of them
sided with America's Communist
enemies. It's been argued that they
were concerned about America‘s

to show this concern than by spit-
tingonretumingsoldicrs and pelting
them with bags full of dog excre»
merit? After seeing thctr friends die
and risking their own lives in
Vietnam, the soldiers must have
found this a heartening welcome.
Peace protesters in Madison and
Berkeley burned the American flag
and canted the flag of North Vicir
nam. They supported the North's
president with their chants of“Ho,
Ho, HoCiti Minh; LthLFisgoing
to win!” Indeed, they were quite
unabashed in their support of the
North, whose land mines were
malmlng our soldiers and whose
army was killing them with AK-
47simported front thCSoVIClUniort.
Jane Fonda illustrated their views
rattler vividly when she went to the
North and posed beside nn :1an
aircraft gun whose purpose was to
shootdown American pilots. Obvir
ously, a concern for American lives
was the farthest thing from the
minds of the anti-war movement,
and its protests were divorced from
all patriotism.

Thcanli-warinovemcntclaimed
that America's involvement in
Vietnam was a bloodbiith. Blood-
bath? Do these people know whtti
happencd when theU.S.pulled out,
ended its support for the South and
for Lon Nol’s Cambodian govcm-
merit, the Communist North over-
ran and annexed the South, and the
Khmer Rouge took power tn Carnr
bodia‘? Since then, southeast Asia
has been one of the World's
slaughterhouses, with 200,000
murdered in Vietnam and three
million in Cambodia. The last 16
years have seen the exodus by boat
of hundreds of thousands of Viet-
namese, ﬂeeing Stalinist tyrtinny.
All this because liberals in our
government moved to terminate
support for the governments of the
SouthandCambodia, which, while
not democratic pamgons, did not
provoke men and women to ﬂee
their homelands en masse.
