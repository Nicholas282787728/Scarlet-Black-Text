Last Thursday, while tlte
search for Tammy Zywieki was still
under process, there was an “Allv
the-beer-you-can-drink-forVSSOO7
minors included—" offer in State
Street Station, I feel obltged to ex-
press my personal feelings for this
event, becauselfoundoutdiatquire
a few people share the same feelings
widi me.

I'masophomorewhodidn’t
know Tammy Zywieki, but like any
intellectually healthy person, I feel
disgustforsick actionslike her brutal
murder. Specifically regarding last
week’s agony during the search, I
must say thatI shared it —to the
extent that my personality required
me to— with the rest of the college
community. Butlsaw my feelings of
agony turn into those of discomfort,
when I heard about the State Street
event. Two things crossed my mind:
“How can they organize a drink-for-
less fundraiserin timcsof such agony
andantieipated grief. And why should
anybody have to raise money, in or
dertohelpinthesearch foramissing
person?” There are answers for both
of these questions.

I'll begin with the second
one, since it’s the one for which I
don’t hold any Grinnell student re-
sponsible. I understand that money
was needed towards the end of pubr
iicizing and circulating the available
informationaboutZywicki’spossible
kidnapper. But why in the world
should any individual have to fund
any part of the process of the search
for a missing person? What is the
police’s duty and responsibility after
all? Shouldn‘t they be both willing

and able to extend all information
around the country? I think they
should. I do know that the event
supposedly raised $1,500, but I do
finditterrifyingthatthepoliceofthis
country are not sufﬁcient for spread-
ing the information about a missing
person, Thisleads meto reflectupon
all the scary truths that we know,
concerning the reality of this
counLry‘spolice (Sec: Rodney King,
etc.)

Now, the other thought. I

things that the American police
should be able to do. In fact, I will
even accept as readily understood,
the faetthatthere wasindeed need for
Grinnell’seommunitytoraise money
inordertomake thescurch fothtmmy
morecfficient, My problem ltas todo
with the way that was chosen to raise
this money. Toorganize an All-you-
can-drink-for-$5.00 deal, is to throw
a party and a quite big one too, con
sidering the fact that for the first time
since The Bar, minors were allowed
to nurchase and consume alcohol in

Grinnell, IA. Whoever had the idea,
knew that lots and lots of younger
studans would take advantageof the
deal. This, I find an exploitation of
the minorstudents. Butthis is notall.
An all-you-can»drirtk offer is 100%
certain to lead some of the partici-
pants into an unsober state of mind
This,l think isanasty exploitation of
the minor students, for by this deal
they are in a way forced to get drunk
and possibly do and say things that
might be most inappropriate for a
r riodof general griefanda-on . (l

have to note here, that I did go to
State Street only becausel wanted to
have a beer and therefore, I don‘t
consider myself as having con-
sciously contributed to the
funrdraising. I can‘t fell guilty for
this, because I believe that it would
be more appropriate and decent to
raise money by directly asking for
contributions, insteadof the way that
was chosen. Besides, the mere idea
oforganizingapany,direetlyassoci-
atedwitha missingpersonis,l think,
hihl controversial)

Tammy’s gone home

God saw she was getting tired,

and an extended life was not to be,
and whispered, “Come home with me."
Although we loved her dearly,

we could not make her stay.

A golden heart stopped beatingr

A determined spirit was at rest.
God broke our hearts to prove to us
he only takes the best!

—Jerry Simmons
