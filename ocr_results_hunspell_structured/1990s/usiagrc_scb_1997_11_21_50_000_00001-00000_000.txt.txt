Progress in AIDS Research

Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital have
announced a discovery they say might help efforts to
formulate an AIDS vaccine. The researchers say they have
learned how some people’s immune systems ﬁght off the
AIDS virus. They say the secret may lie in the clues the
immune system uses to recognize HIV. All bacteria»
viruses and other invaders have a protein coat that the
body’s immune system can recognize. Researchers use
this when they try to formulate vaccines, and have tried a
number of proteins from HIV’s 'coat.

Iraq Agrees to Allow Inspections

Iraq Thursday approved an accord worked outwith Russia
allowing U.N. arms monitors including Americans to
return to Baghdad and resume inspections, apparently
defusing a three-week-old crisis. “We think that the crisis
is over," Iraqi Ambassador to the United Nations Nizar
Hamdoon told reporters Hamdoon praised Russia's
mediation in the crisis. He said Moscow had promised to
work to ensure that the arms inspections — aimed at
dismantling Iraq‘s weapons of mass destruction under the
1991 Persian Gulf War cease-fire — resulted in
international sanctions against Iraq being lifted.

 

Egypt Militant Group Offers Truce

Egypt’s largest Islamic militant group yesterday offered
the government a conditional truce after this week’s killing
of 58 tourists in Luxor. “The al-Gama’a al»Islamiya
(Islamic Group) could halt its military operations for a
while if the Egyptian regime acts likewise and stops its
unjust campaigns against the sons of the Gama' a, releases
its prisoners, returns Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman to his
homeland... and cuts relations with the Zionist entity," it
said in a statement sent to international media. Gama‘a
claimed responsibility for Monday ’5 camage in Luxor in
which at least six militants opened fire at the temple of
Hatshepsut.

in the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which over 800.000
Tutsis were killed.

Israel Strengthens Resolve

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday
a shooting in Jerusalem that killed a Jewish seminary
student and wounded another only strengthened Israel‘s
resolve to hold on to all ofthe holy city. Netanyahu told a
news conference he had given instructions to “beef up
security in the Old City,“ including “another point of
presence" for Israeli police at the site of the overnight
attack. The students, members of a right-wing Jewish
settler movement, were lambushed while returning to a
settler»owned home deep‘in the Old City‘s Muslim quarter
in what police said was probably a Palestinian guerrilla
attack.

the brink of collapse Thursday. but then stepped back from
giving it a make-or-break deadline to oust a southern
regional party from its coalition, But amid a frenzy 0
political maneuvering, Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral’s United Front hunkered down and even announced
a key economic reform. The Congress party. which had
talked tough all day, drew back. Having threatened to

Students fear their voices not heard

Only one student allowed on Trustee’s commitee to search for next president

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
News/Features Editor

Since Pamela Ferguson's October 16
resignation the Grinnell College admin—
istration and trustees have been working
to fill the gap that she will leave,

In a memorandum addressed to the
Grinnell Campus community from the
Chair of the Board OfTrustees Elizabeth
Ballantine, trustee members of the search
committee were named. A smaller come
mittee than that which chose President
Ferguson was designed because it was
hoped that streamlining would reduce see
lection time. In addition, it was announced
that the faculty would choose its own repr
resentatives and that the student body
would be represented by SGA president
Erin Childress ‘98.

When it was announced that only 'one
student would be on the committee, as
opposed to the three who were involved
in the appointment of Ferguson, Corey
Twitchell ‘99 and Kate Jones ‘99 felt that

the student body was being
underrepresented. In an email message
that Twitchell, Jones, Leah Ray ‘00,
Laurie Kaufflnan ‘99 and Carlos Macias
‘99 sent out to many students and Olganlr
zations, they said. “as the largest cone
stituency in this process, our representar
tion should be greater. , . It is Imperative
that we work quickly and as a unified stun
dent body in order Io assure our repre-
sentation in this matter."

Students upset by low student repre-
sentation on the Search Committee have
not communicated directly with the Board
ofTrustees or with the commlttec, as the
only means of communication currently
available are via a \lax account and a fax
number. A letter has, however, been sent
to Chairperson Ballantine. and students
have begun a process to elect an addi-
tional student for the committee.

On Wednesday night a meeting was
held to discuss the issue of
underrepresentation. Thirty students were
present.

Those who attended the meeting ad-
dressed thc student body Vlaemail to out-
line their campaign “for an additional stu-
dent to be placed on the presidential
search committee "

The email requested that students in-
lercslcd III joining the search committee
“submit a briefparagraph outlining their
concerns about diversity and other issues
to which the next president will be at-
tuned” to [MOSENG] by 1pm Friday,
November 20, with “nomination" in the
subject line. “Voting Will be held on Mon-
day in the post office." the message said.

In addition, a petition carrying the sig-
natures of many students will be faxed to
the trustees on Monday.

‘jWe have no direct communication
with trustees, but by doing this we hope
to show that we want and deserve better
communication.” Twitchcll said.

There will be a meeting on Sunday in
ARH 302, Twitcltell said, to discuss these
issues. The time has not yet been decided.

At Wednesday’s meeting, a consensus

-was reached that “the Selection Commit

tee that is searching for a new president
does not represent the students at Grin-
nell," said Chris Moscng ‘00 who was
presellt zit the meeting. “The trustees out-
number cvcrybody else on the commit-
tee, and the students are the vast major-
Ity of people on campus," Moseng con-
tinued.

“The other prong of the Issue is that
while Erin [Childrcss] is competent, she
may not feel comfortable representing
the political minority, as she was elected
to represent the majority," Moseng said.

This issue was addressed In the letter
that Twitchell. Jones, Kauffman, Erin
Hendel ‘99 and Jeetander Dulani ‘98
addressed to Chair of the Board ofTrustr
ees, Elizabeth Ballanline. “Given the
narrow margin of [Childrcss's] victory
and the stark contrast of the candidates'
Views, it is obvious that a signiﬁcant por—
tion of the student body did not and does
not feel represented by SGA," the letter

Grinnell responds to the rash of vandalism

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Editor-In—Chief

Grinnell College and the town ofGrinr
nell have undertaken discussion and ac-
tion in response to the vandalism that oc-
curred here over Halloween weekend. Of
particular concern to town representatives
and students were the racial slurs painted
on Randall Lahann's vehicle.

The Grinnell Human Rights Commis-
sion, which was founded In 1969 to gather
information about discriminatory acts and
to promote understanding among people
of different racial, ethnic. and religious
groups, has begun a campaign to raise
awareness about racial issues on campus
and in town. “I hope that asa result of
this. the tensions that arise from living in
a community with a diversity ofresidents

will be given a hlghel' priority, said Com-
mission president Lolya Lipchitz. Mem-
bers also hope to establish the Commis
sion as a frequentlyrused resource for stu
dents who want to discuss or report dis-
criminatory attacks occurring in the Grin-
nell area.

Ill addition. the Grinnell City Council
voted Monday to send the Poweshiek
County Attorney a message illustrating
that they take the vandalism seriously.
The message stated that in the event that
someone is arrested and charged in con—
nection to the vandalism, the Council en-
courages county representatives to show
zero tolerance towards the perpetrator(s).

Many students agrce that authorities at
the college and In town should be vocal
and active in response to the racist vane
dzllism “I think the college should issue

a statement expressing that
this cannot be tolerated. The
college can‘t sweep this unr
der the rug, If we are such a
progressive liberal institution
then we should have a respon-
sibilitylodosomething," said
Tarah Dunn 99.

“It would be nice if
Grinnellians would be more
active in finding evidence to
catch the perpetrators," con»
cluded an anonymous senior.

“We need to ﬁnd out who did it."

Other students felt less able to affect
change In the community. “Whatcan they
do? These are random acts ofignorance,"
said sophomore Mary Beth Dechant. “I
think people need to realize that it's an
isolated incident. I am not saying people

PHO 'ME ANH TINGS

shouldn’t worry about it because it obvi-
ously offended and hurt people. It’s
tough. [don’t know what can be done,"

The Grinnell Police Department’s in-
vestlgation of the vandalism continues.
“We’re working on some things, but
nothing has progressed yet," commented
Police Sergeant Randy Hansscn.

Students to Vote on two initiatives

Students propose local HIV tests

BY RYAN OLSON
Staff Writer

For Over three years, Grinnellians Es-
calating AIDS Response [GEAR] has
been petitioning Grinnell College for ace
cess to free anonymous HIV testing.
“What We’ve been doing." said GEAR co-
organizer Jeremy Youde ‘99,‘ is trying to
get students transportation to testing. But
it’s not fair to have students take all that
time out,"

Testing. which is only available in
Iowa City and Des Moines, requires two
round trips, and includes the actual test, a
return trip for results, and counseling, of-
ten takes a total of eight hours.

“We've worked some With the [Com-
mittee on Student] Health," said Youde.
“It's been trying to publicize driving and
overall awareness. but it’s not getting us
to where we need to be."

This year, GEAR hopes to pass a stu—
dent initiative which states that ”the col-
lege needs to provide access to free, con-

fidential and anonymous HIV testing, ei-
ther on campus or in town.

“What we have discovered," said
Youde, “is that the issue is too large for
students alone. This is an issue of public
health and shouldn't have to be thrown in
the laps of students."

, Citing the Mental Health Center's af»
filiati'on wllh the college, Youde said that
“Grinnell can use Its inﬂuence and work
with the town to create needed health
structure, and we believe that Ihe.college
can again take the lead in establishing this
much-needed service."

Student Initiative voting will take place
on Tuesday, November 25, from 8am to
noon and 1,00 to 4pm in the post ofﬁce,
from 4:50 until S'ZOpm outside of Quad
dinlng hall and from 5:30 until 6pm out»
side of Cowles dining hall. At least half
of students must vote, and two-thirds of
voting students must be In favor of the
initlatlve for it lo pass, Joint Board wlll
work alongside authors of passing inIIia—
tives to ensure their implementation.

 

Students desire college sponsored co-ops

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

Students looking for alternatives to the
dinning halls or the forum grill for their
culinary needs are in luck. The Co-op
Conspiracy (TCC), a group of Grinnell
students with a passion for sensible sup»
ping and roguish appellations has submit
led an Initiative, that, if approved, would
result in more living and dinning options
for all Grinnell students.

The initiative from TCC received over-
whelming support last week when volun-
teers received hundreds of si gnatures from
interested Grinnell students.

In terms of starting a co-op, TCC pro-
poses thnt campus housIng and even
dorms would be offered for rent to COVOp
organizations. These Organlzations would
collect dues from their patrons to pay for
the rent and food the coop would pro-
vide. These ducs would take the place of
room and board fees students currently
pay to the college.

“This' is totally a student movement,
said Shannon Blmel ‘00. member of
TCC. “Students from all over campus
could do it. Anyone with the means could
start a co-op for any reason. It could be
an eating focus like vegetarianism or
kosher or it could be focused around a
living arrangement. It would give stun
dents an option. They could eat in coopr
eratlves full time or split meals between
co-ops and 2t partial board plan.”

In an effort to produce the most effec-
tive plan possible, TCC has gotten in
toucll with other organizations such as
the Nonh American Students of Coop~
eration and Oberlin College for advice
and ideas, As a result ofthis dialogue. a
TCC delegation will be traveling to
Oberlin to study their system this Febru—
ary,

Students also stand to save money,
For example, the initiative would create
larger and more accessible corops at
Grinnell like the Vegan Co-op.

Arcadia. a dialOgue between past and present

BY LAUREN WOLFE
Staff Writer

The Grinnell Theater Department will
be performing Arcadia. Tom Stoppard's
1993 romantic comedy, Nov. 2023 at
8pm in Arena Theater. The play, taking
place in both the early 19th century and
the present day. has been described by
Director Ellen Mease as “a dialogue be-
tween past and present, a love story
wrapped in a mystery drama,"

Math professor John Stone called
Arcadia “a carefully balanced play that
resists summary. It is no more ‘about' the
history of science than it is ‘about' land
scape gardening, academic infighting,
Romantic genius, or carnal embrace,"

Yet the play Includes all ofthcse things.
It is fast moving and dense. “An ingenious
work of well-crafted poetry," said
Kiersten Moore ‘98, who plays Lady
Croom. “It is the best thing written since
Hamlet,"

The play’s central theme, according to

PHI

Mouse, is “order telldlng to disorder as
veiy human protagonists suffer in their de-
mand for clztllty in the Inidst of confu-
sion " This chItInI theme is demonstrated
in three “Ilietophoric contexts": historical
and modem mathematics and physics, En-
glish landscape gardening, and the "cul-
tural sea changes of the early 19th cen-
tury" as the scientific realism of lhe Age
of Enllghtcllmellt gavc way to the "Roy
Inantlc \vildcrllcss."

“Its a really big play
with a lot of ideas and
alotolchziracters,” said
Sarah Gavitt ‘98, who
plays the modern-day
writer Hannah Jarvis,
“so It’s been challenge
ing. But it's also been a
lot of fun. There is so
much to this play that
It can't help but have a

big impact on anyone
‘ nvolved with its pro.
1 ducllon,”

The play Is set in the same garden room .

at Arcadia in both time periods its 19th
century scenes arcjuxtziposed right next
to its present dziy scenes, producing an
ironic effect when the dialogue leads to
the nature ol‘ limc.
