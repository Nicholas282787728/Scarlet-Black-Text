GRINNELL—NANJING TEACHING FELLOWSHIPS
1991—1992

Grillncll College appoints two of its graduates each year as teaching fellows to assist for an academic year in the teaching ofEnglish at Number 11
High School. afﬁliated with Nanjing University in Nanjing, People’s Republic of China. The Grinncll-Nanjing Teaching Fc1lt>wship allows these
graduates to work closely with Chinese high-school teachers and students while living with foreign students in the Foreign—Student Dormitory at
Nanjing University. In sponsoring the Fellowships, Grinncll College and Nanjing University hope to provide the Fellows with opportunities to know
Chinese society well, to view their own lives and American society in a wider perspective, and to develop a lively scnsc ofintcrnational citizenship.

In selecting the Teaching Fellows, Grinncll College seeks native speakers of English who have an excellent command of ora1 and written English and
who have experience in the study ofanotltcr language. The candidates should haven sound knowledge ofAmcrican culture and a demonstrated interest
in Chinese culture, though command of the Chinese language is not essential. The selection committee seeks candidates from the graduation class
of 1991 who will be worthy rcprcsenativcs of the the College and who can work well with others in fulfilling their responsibilities in Nanjing.

The Gl’lllllClert’lllj-illg leaching Fellowship provtdes travel expenses, living expenses, and housing in thc Foreigantudcnt Domlitory at Nanjing
University. The Fellowship is tenable throughout the highrschool academic year, from September 1 to mid-July. The Teaching Fellows will be
supervised by the English faculty of Number 11 High School in teaching classes for approximately twelve hours per week. Ajotlrncy by boat through
the Yangtze River Gorges and overland journeys to Xian and Beijing will be provided during academic recesses.

The Teaching Fellows will be expected to keep journals and to send three reports to Grinnell College during the academic year. After their return to
the United States, they will be expected to spclltl one “'ch cal ly in the scmcstcr in Grinncll to talk with faculty and students ttbotll their year in China,
