’ Ya‘ golta believe! The Grinncll
women‘s basketball team certainly
does. The Pioneers defeated Coe

The weather last Saturday
was poor for a Lrnck meet, but
disregard for the weather is what
signifies Indoor Track. In fact,
the only problem which
if the
narrow. one-tenth of a mile
track, would give enough
traction to runners giving il
their all.

No team scores were kept,
so the mcct at Central was a
valuable opportunity for those
who went to gain race
experience in a low-pressure
situation. It was also a chance
for the teams to get to know
each other and to cheer on one
another, as it was not overly
difficult to discern the Grinncll
participants from among the
four teams present. Let‘s hope
this team spiritrcontinues and
grows. Since it was the first
meet of the season, spirit gave
many track members a useful

Several athletes performed
admirably in the field events.
On the women's side, Abby
Green, in spite of being the sole
entrant in the high jump, tied
the meet record. and set a new
school record, with ajump of 5'

was put in by Missy Ebitz.
Although throwing for the very

On the men‘s team, Leo
Kraemer displayed his vaunted
style in the pole vault, and
began the season with a jump of

ﬂew quite a bit was Mark St.
Andre, who went 21’ in the

impressive triple jump and 55

Swimmers
Confident
about Weekend

By Holly Kellar

The Grinncll men's and
woincn's swimming and diving
teams are looking forward to a
full weekend. Friday night.
starting at 6.00, the Pioneers
will compete against Northeast
Missouri. This is a snow date,
so to speak, for the meet was
originally scheduled for last
Friday. NEMO was unable to
make it because of the weather.
As if one meet weren‘t enough,
Saturday the teams will compete
again, this time in the State
meet against other Division III
schools in lowa.

Women‘s coach Slicila Cain
plans on taking the meet with
NEMO “fairly lightly.” She
places more importance on the
State meet. which she is
looking to win. “There are

, strong individuals on every

team, but I think that our depth

will win the meet."

Men's coach Ray Obcrmiller
is also pretty confident about
Grinncll‘s ability to take first in
the Slate incet. “We've never
lost it.” The men’s team has
beaten NEMO twice this year,
and Obcrmillcr is hoping that
this will be the case again on
Friday.

Both coaches see this
weekend as very important in
the preparation for confcrcnce.
The meets wtll help the coaches
in determining the lineup that
will be used at the conference
mcel, which will be held
Feb.22724 for the women, and
March 13 for the men,

not help but be impressed with «
the women’s races. Two of A
their fine sprinters are Jennifer
Jones and Amy Reinhnrt, both A
of whom did surprisingly well ‘
in the 300 M dash, with Amy
placing second in the 55 M dash o
as well. .loAltne Sackett was an
easy winner in the 600 M run,
demonstrating that she is a force «
with which to reckon. ,
Meanwhile, David
Hammond shook off a year's ‘
hiatus to place second in the A
1500 M. with a time of 4:11,
and was, an extremely close ‘
second in the 1000 M. In the .
last event of the day, Chris
Garman and Guy Potter ran ’
rather fast legs in the 4 X 400 a
M relay.
Tomorrow both teams travel 1
to the Southern Division Meet i
and tougher competition. The
teams will use this meet as a 4
way to find out the best mix of t
participants in each event.
