LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
George Bush is a "cool" guy

[am writing in response toAlanna
Walcn’s review of Two Nice Girls
which appeared in the April 17, 1992.
issue of the Scarlet and Black. At the
end of her otherwise impressive and
persuasive review, she stated, "If you
think George Bush is eool....okay.
maybenoteverybody\villenjoythisd
band."

I happen to think George Bush is

"cool," competent and worthy of re-
election. Political conviction aside,
however, I resent Alanna's iinplicar
tion that a supporter of George Bush,
i.e.., a Republican. cannot and will
notappreeiate and support the gay/bi/
lesbian community. Gays, lesbians,
and bisexuals have long had to battle
elose-mindedness and prejudice; it
surprises me that one who has acV

tively foughtthis negative stereotyp~
ing would be so hasty to impose her
ownequallyclose-mindedstercotypcs
on others.

We on this campus must be as we
are to liberal ideas. I'm not requesting
thatAlannatum Republicanbutonly
that she give the same respect to my
beliefs and way of life as she asks me
to give hers. Catherine Carter ‘94

 

COMMON

SENSE

Duke, the undying leech

After Pat Buchananannouncedhis
candidacy, David Duke's campaign
became futile. People who had reluc-
tantly backed the former salesman of
The Hitler We LovedAnd Why forgot
him and backed the real conservative.
That’s a relief—Duke's comeliness,
like Dorian Gray’s, dissembles a vile
character,

Born in Tulsa in 1950, Duke moved
with his family to New Orleans, the
city where he would gain notoriety.
Around 1968 he graduated from a
local high school, whose other faA
mous alumn is none other than Lee
Harvey Oswald, who, contrary to
Oliver Stone, probably shot John F.
Kennedy. Duke recalled Oswald in
his aloofness, and also in his political
radicalism, although Oswald was at
the other end of the spectrum, a fan of
Castroandan avid reader oftheDai'Iy
Worker. (He and his life are the sub-
ject of a fine novel by Don DeLillO,
entitled Libra.)

For a while, Duke had the politics
of aGrinnell student. Hehated racism
so intensely that he chose, in high
school, to write a paper refuting the
avatars of racial science. But some
where along the line. according to his
biographer Michael Zatarain, Duke
heardtheSirensoftthhiteCitizens
Council. At the Council’s ofﬁce near
downtown New Orleans, he perused

Mike Washburn

had tried to escape the drab life of a
mediocre Scientist through provocar
tivc claims of Negro inferiority. When
his classmates were at home watch-
ing afterrschool specials on TV, Duke
was down at the WCC office, reading
about the differences between Nee
groes and his Nordic race.

Thus he was drawn to the racism
he only recently claimed to have re4
nounced, His views made him infa-
mous when, as a student atLouisiana
State University, he voiced them atop
a soapbox. He befriended other race
ists. natnely Toni Metzger, a TV re-
pairrnan. and nee-Nazi psychopath.
The friendship with Metzger quickly
died when Duke sawjust how farcut
his buddy was. An item Metzger ran
in the White Aryan Resistance News-
letter argued that the survival of the
white race superseded all codi ficd
laws. He brought on to his cable talk
show a man who believed that, in the
eventofa Sovietinvasion oftheU.S.,
Aryans should side with the Soviet
army,simply bccauseitwasall—white.

Metzger'sdictum aboutwhitesur-
vival superseding law apparently was
heeded by two men in Portland who
violently dispatched an Ethiopian felA
low,bringing Mctzgcrto the centerof

a heady civil liberties case.

During the Vietnam war Duke
spent some time in Laos, where his
father, a high-ranking officer. was
stationed. After that he went to Israel,
where, he famously claims, the
Mossad tried to poison him with a
chicken salad sandwich. Here we see
evidence of the anti-Semitism Duke
absorbed from the works of George
Lincoln Rockwell , the American Nazi
assassinated in 1967 by one of his
henchmen.

Back in America, Duke ran for
President in 1988 as a member of the
Populist Party, which included such
attractive people as the Nazi Ralph
Forbes. Having received even fewer
votesthanJesseJackson (whom Duke,
as a fringe politician with a fixation
on race, slightly resembles), Duke
rested fora brief while, until the 1989
race for a seat on the Louisiana State
Legislature. Despite the best efforts
of Reagan and Bush to destroy him
through television ads, Duke beat the
RepublicancandidateJohnTreenand
ascended to the seat on the legislate
lure.

As Zatarain writes, it’s the very
worst people who are drawn to racist
ideologies. That's because their main
