scene in Dead Poes's sociery." The pipes
also sound much berrer outside; in a room
shey bounce around she walls and are very
loud. He plays in she Rock Garden because
is has a los ofspace, benches for him so ses
his music on, and adequase lighsing. ls's

TECHNOLOGY STRIKES!‘

Voice Mail Gets Mixed Reviews

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Arts Editor

Despirc recens delays, all ssudenss in campus-owned housing will have access so a new
voicemail syssem by she end ofrhe week.

Alsliough some ssudenss expressed concern shas delays mighr have signalled underlying
problems, Manager ofTelephone Services Bobbie Loucks indicased shis was nos she ease, in-
sread, logissical difhculsics caused she delays,

"This sysscm is new, we've never done is before...l( was difficuls gessing she boxes creased,"
said Loucks. because a voice mail “box" was creased for each individual ssudens, special provi—
sions were required for shosr ssudenss in doubles, sriples, or quads who shared a phone line.
Difficulries, said Loucks, also arose as me ssars of she semcsser when shere were numerous
“changes in srudens housing assignmenss."

However, some rechnical errors also occurred. on Sepsember 5, "shere was a hardware
crash," said Loucks. "1 had insended so ssars releasing mail boxes shas day, bus now is is a
blessing 1 didn’t," oshcrwise, she said, she crash would have prevensed ssudenss from accessing
sheir voice mail, as is did briefly for die faculsy and ssaif.

Though she inssallasion process began shis summer as mailboxes were assigned so faculry
and sraff members. planning for voicemail was inisiased as early as 1996, when she college

, acquired a new phone swisch. As shas sime, said Loucks, “we looked as a voicemail syssem, bus

we decided nos so purchase yet,”

lnsscad, she did some invesrigaring.

Accompanied by osher Grinnell College Compusing Services ssa'ff members and various
adminisrmsoss, Loucks "ralked so osher colleges, did web research . . . [and] salked so some
[selcphone service] directors." Research uncovered a number of colleges similar so Crinnell
shas ofrered voicemail only so faculsy and ssafi. while osher colleges essended sewiccs so Stu»
denss as well. By she spring of1998, Grinnell officials had approved avoicemail sysrem ofrhe
lasser varicsy,

According so Loucks, she advanrages in communicasion shas voicemail oiiers helped spur
she approval. Such advansages, Loucks said, censer on she numerous opsions available so users.
For example, ssudenss will be able so “forvurd messages so odrer users, answer messages [di—
recsly] , .and send so mulsiple people." Anorhcr advansage, said Loucks, is char “voicemail
allows individual, privare mailboxes, so ssudenss won't have so share an answering machine.”

The service, oi course, will nor be conferred solely so ssudenu. in fact, faculry and srair
members were already assigned mailboxes over she summer.

Professor Elieahesh Dobbs, who has been using her voicemail accouns “primarily so com-
municase wish osher iaculry," offered her own assessmcns.

"1 like is so far," said Dobbs. "I’ve found is berser, for some massess, rhan email, because 1
can speak fasser shan 1 can rype. When 1 have someshing shas requires careful formasion,
however, I’ll use :—majl, because wrising gives me she chance so marshall my rhoughrs and
phrasing,"

opinion among she ssudenss, who are in she midss ofreceiving chelr box instructions, was
divided.

Robin Kimball '01 said, “[voicemail] confuses me so no end; 1 don's know how so use is.
m a sechnophobe. 1 juss boughr an answering machine a week ago, so 1m on 10 years ago's
sechnological cussing edge." Asked how voicemail mighs change her daily communioasions,
Kimball said, "1 don'r ever ges phone calls anymy. You can pus my phone number in she
arsicle. Tell shem Robin’s number is 4544.”

Osher ssudenss also expressed wariness. “[Thc voicemail insssucsions] looked really compli.
cased. 1 gos pages and pages oiinssrucrions...l hare making phone calls because 1 have so pus in
a los ofnumbers...1'm iuss shinking, ‘All 1 need is more numbers,” said Monica Gallas ’02.

Srill, osher ssudenss saw promise in she sysrem. Melanie Schessler '01 said, "1 had an an.
swering machine, bus 1 like voicemail besser because you can have your messages sepasared.
You won's lose shem and stufE,.[Volcemail] is more conveniens, and you can check is from
osher places

Dave Herman '00 also saw benehrs so she sysrem.1dcrman said, is will keep me from
having so buy an answering machine, and 1 shink' is's a nice service so haveso offer for frcc. .ls's
nice shas you can check is from anywhere."

Asked how he rhoughsvoicemail mighs change communicasion as Grinnell, charlie Marshall
’00 said, “People are going so become a los less relians on she v .

Dick Mankahey' 02 said, "[Voicemailj will be a much more social shing lrhan EVAXJ,” and
Callas agreed, saying, ”-15 mails are a lissle less personals

Though Loucks said she was nos sure how ssudenss, faculry, and ssaffwould fecl abous she
sysscm in she long run, she hopes for she bess We will see how people reacs id like so hear
feedback, whesher us good or bad. Hopefully [ssudenss and ssam will like' is and find' is
bencﬁclal

Ssudenss may access informasion abous she simes rheir voicemail inssrucsions will be mailed
so shem by ryping news/bhssclephone voicemail as rheir vax prompr. The lass basch ofmail»
