Symposium brings subcontinent issues to Grinnell

BY CHRIS NEARY
,Staff Writer

Next week’s “Symposium on the
Indian Subcontinent in Transition"
will feature six speakers and address
topics speciﬁc to the area such as
“The Identity of Bangladesh" and
“Indian Foreign Policy After the
Cold War." This series of talks and
presentations which begin on Sep-
tember 16, will bri ng political and so-
cial issues from across the globe to
the plains of Iowa,

During the year and a half of
preparation for this symposium. six
authorities on the Indian subcontie
nent which includes India,

NEWS & FEATURES

Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sn Lanka, and
Nepal were chosen to speak on a
number of contemporary issues.
They include college professors, a
member of the US Department of
Health and the chief of the United
Nations Bureau of the New York
Times.

The Indian subcontinent sympo-
sium was organized by the
Rosenfield Program. Bradley
Bateman, the chair ofthe Rosenﬁeld
Program at Grinnell while William
Moyeris on leave, feels events in the
subcontinent are relevant, especially
in lowa, “The Rosenfielcl Program
began planning ior this symposium
in May of 1996. two school years ago

whcii a student on the board wlto was
concerned with the vistbility of lne
dian subcontinent issues had the fore»
sight to notice that the next year
{1997] would mark India's ﬁftieth
anniversary as a democracy."
Bateman feels the large popula-
tion of the subcontinent, coupled
with the maturing of the Indian doe
niocracy have catalyzed the Grinnell
community's and the world
community‘s interest in the region.
"The independence of the subconti-
nent has been in world news for
tnonths now and I am sure that all
Iowans who read their newspapers
are aware of the current interest in
this important area of the world."

Pyschedelic Festival flying high

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Grinnell's annual outdoor festival.
Alice in Wonderland. will return to
campus under the guidance of Mike
“Mike D“ Dziegielewski ‘99 on Sate
urday, September 20.

Alice, which will begin at 1pm on
Central Campus, will feature addi-
tions to the traditional live music, tiee
dying, bubbles and ans and crafts.
Casey Hallas ‘98 will run the pros
jection of psychedelic images inside
of a tent designed by Nicholas Rains
.‘00,

Mike D ran Alice last year as well:
But this year the SGA has become
more involved. SGA Concert Chair

Paul Conn ‘98 and All Campus
Events Chair Brian Baltes '99 par
ticipated in the planning, which is
still underway.

Starting Tuesday, plain Alice t-
shirts. designed by Andy Kropa '93
and Byron Groves ‘97, will go on
sale for nine dollars. For the ﬁrst
time, Mike D said, preedycd shirts,
produced by a “quasirprofessional
tie-dye artist" will be available, at
twelve dollars apiece.

Alice will showcase bands from
both on- and off» campus. This year
Conn was responsible for booking
Natty Nation, a reggae band from
Madison, Wisconsin. Mike D. is still
looking for “the best of the best"

campus bands to perform. “If any
one is interested in performing at
Alice can come talk to me and ifyour
organization wants to set up a booth
or get involved, just come talk to
me,"

Music is not the only draw to
Alice. Mike D, who expects from
250 to 500 people to attend the festie
val, predicts, “With their mouths dry
from tired routines, people come to
Alice to find a different flavor."
While Aaron Wagner '99 suggests
that perhaps tired routines are not the
only cause of dry mouth at Alice,
“It’s when all the people who drink
do pot, and all the people who smoke
up drop acid.”

“It is also a ttnie of fundamental
change in the region as Inditt has in
recent years started to embrace free
markets and put its efforts at sociale
ism behind it," said Bateman “Since
India ts the world's largest democ-
racy, these fundamental changes
mean that a huge population of
people are now entering the world
training system,"

The countries ofthe subcontinent
are also important to investigate be»
cause they are in many ways a mtr
crocosm of the world at large.
Crowded with different racial, ethe
nic and class groups they provide an
example of many of the problems
that are prevalent all over the world,

“If you know what's going on,
fifty dollars [to install an ethernet
card] isn’t worth it," said one UC
who Wished not to be identified. in
terestingly enough. CompUSA
agrees, According to the technical
representatives at the Des Moines
CompUSA store, instillation of any
ethernet card. is forty dollars. No
matter how long the process takes.
It is this apparent contradiction that
has led many students to believe they
are being taken advantage of.

“What we’re really happy about
is having the upgrade facility on
campus.“ said Mike Pifer, Grinnell’s

Scarlet & Black - Friday, September .12

For a college concerned witli diver—
sity, the issues confronting the Indian
subcontinent seem especially rel-
evant

“The purpose of the symposla
sponsored by the Rosenfield Pro-
gram is always to give the campus
an opportunity to find out more about
an important topic," Bateman said.
“There are opportunities to learn
about important tssues/ questions/
topics and to meet experts in many
different fields."

The symposium speeches will be
held in the South Lounge of the F0-
rum beginning at4215 and at 8:00pm,
wtth thc exception of the convocae
tlon speech in Herrick Chapel,

ResNet Specialist.

“Other service centers offer rates
from forty nine dollars an hour to
eighty nine dollars an hour," said
Dale. The CompUSA center provides
a flat rate for all serviccs available,
but those that can‘t be provided here
must be referred to the store in Des
Moines.

In Des Moines, rates fluctuate
from twenty nine dollars and ninety
seven cents to install peripheral cards
(such as sound cards or internal mos
dems). to sixty nine dollars and
ninety seven cents to install hard
disks or CD-ROM drives, to seventy
nine dollars and ninety seven cents,
an hour. to ﬁx older computers, or

causes are immediately apparent.
Then there is the satisfaction issue.

Crime on campus is now reported
to Larson, instead of Krohn. who
serves on thejudicial committee.

“Depending on the severity of the
crime, we sometimes want to get the
police involved,” Larson said. “In
the case of severe crime, such as
sexual assault or homicide, we no-
tify the campus immediately through
the [vax]."

A crime repon will now by printed
in the Campus Memo every week.

“They gave me the wrong cables,"
said one first year student who
wished not to be identiﬁed. Many
others had similar problems, from
incorrectly bundled products to err
roneous technical advice,

“The first week was rough," said
Dale. “There were thirty students
who bought computers and not
enough people to set them up."

Many student customers agreed.
Some even sought service provid—
ers other then CompUSA.

“I was very satisfied with the
[ethernet card installation] Neill
Dorn did on my computer," said
Michael Chang ‘0]. Dent, who was

unavailable to comment. has also
made his services available, and like

Moseng. will also install ethernet
cards for twenty five dollars,

Correction:

Last week Jamal Rogers ’00 was incorrectly quoted as saying “this
year there are only seven new black students,”

There are eleven new Black students on campus this year, seven of
whom are African American, and four of whom are international stu—
