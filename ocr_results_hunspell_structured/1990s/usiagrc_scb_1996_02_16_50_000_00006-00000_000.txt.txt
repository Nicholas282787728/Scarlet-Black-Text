hope that these people recovered.

The sad fact is that neither of
these misfortunes needed to happen.
E-coli infection andheart attacks are
the direct result of consuming ani»

the feces of infected anllhﬂlsilt is
spread into meat through the “fecal
splatter” that ﬂies from the animal
during slaughter. As regards heart
attacks, 97% of coronary occlusions
can be prevented by a vegetarian
diet.

The modern day animaltbused
diet is the least healthy one ever
adopted; it is only through enormous
advances insanitationand medicine
that lifespan has increased. Medical
literature demonstrates unambigu-
ously the superior healthfulness of
vegan and vegetarian diets. Unfor—

our doctors, have been taught inac«

industries or equally inaccurate in—

The USDA is charged with the
task of promoting the meat, dairy,
and egg industries; it is thus not sut—
prising that the “nutritional infer»
motion" they provide is biased in
favor of animal products. The “four
food groups" and the new “food pyt»
amid" are not nutritional guides, but
advertisements created by industry

Pain, Starvation, and Global
Domination

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

Our addiction to animal
products fuels first world domina»
Lion of the third world. In the
third world, both private and gow
ernment moneys go into develop.
mg cash commodities (or export
(livestock and grain for livestock
are the two biggest, rollowcd by
sugar, cocoa, coffee, and banan»
as), while food production lot the
innioriry is neglected. Displaced
peasants and indigenous people
can no longer grow food to feed
themselves and their families,

Forty thousand people starve
to death every year, and ftilly 1.3
billion go to bed hungry every
night. In addition to the simple
obscenityofgluttony in the face of
this reality, third world starvation
is largely a tcsull of the resource
shortage caused by our inefficient
meatrbased diet.

 

It is worth noting that the third
world “elite" consume in the same
manner as Westerners \\ hile the poor
majority starve. Ont: twohundrerh
(I/SOOth) of food growers rake in
over 90% of all profits, and they
spend this money In the first iiorld,
contributing virtually nothing to
their home economies beyond mili-
tary funds and subsistence for the
paupcrs who work their land.

Moreover, the taisun d’étte for
our interventionist military is cash
crops. As an lnlcrnal Pentagon doc
timentexplaincdinMay, l990:“The
underdeveloped world's growing dis—
satisfaction over the gap between
rich and poor nations will create a
fertile breeding ground for insurgen
cies. These insurgencies have the

retain our cheap supply or “cash
Crops" (and animal products are
largest).

At the Earth Summit in Rio
delaneiro,ihethlrclworldnations
argued that US. citizens consume
disproportionately and should cut
back radically. George Bush stat»
ed emphatically that “Our life
style is not open to negotiation.”
This attitude of entitlement cont
sumption is at the toot of both
U.S. imperialism and our personal
decisions to continue our eating
patterns. It is time for all first
world people, as an act of con—
science and stilitlnrity, to give up
our animal-based diet.
