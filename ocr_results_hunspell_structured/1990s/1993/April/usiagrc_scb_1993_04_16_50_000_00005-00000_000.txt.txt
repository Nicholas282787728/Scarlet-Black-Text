ing that even a choice of wording can

Other Faculty Aﬂ‘eched

The impact of tenure decisions
spreads beyond the individual involved
to other untenuret‘l faculty members
who may soon be going through the
process themselves.

“1 think thejunior faculty I have
talked to, and that would be mainly in
the social sciences, are disturbed by
this tenure decision," said tenured eco-
nomics professor Irene Powell.

Due to process conﬁdentiality,
faculty members do not have a lot of
straight information about the criteria
for particular tenure decisions, said
Powell. She saidjunior faculty mem-
bers are trying to guess what the crite-
riamightbeandgagewhatFiizgemld’s
case means for their own chances at
tenure.

Decision Procedure

THE Executive Council, comprised of
Presidenth Ferguson, CollegeDean
Charles Duke, Dean Helen Scott and
seven professors, makes its lenurerocr

ommendau'ous only after a months
long process of review has been coin-
pletcd.

The tenure processusuallyoccurs
during the srxth year ofa professor’s
employment at Grinnell, after several
shorter contracts and reviews.

According to Duke, the process
criteria include teaching: scholarship,
such as articles publish , service to
the college, including committee as
signments, policy—writing participa-
tion, etc.; and a desire ofcolleagues to
retain the professor.

The review begins with the
department's Student Education Poll»
cies Committee (SEPC) conducting a
survey of 40 students who have had
classes during the previous 2 years by
the professor being reviewed. Student
interviewees are selected at random
after being separated by the year they
had the professor and into groups of
lowerrlcvel and upper-level students.
said Duke. The SEPC, composed of
student majors in the depamnent, an. -
lyzes the surveyresults and gives them
with a recommendation for or against
tenure to the depanmeni chair.

Then the deparunent makes its
recommendation.Usuallyonlytheten—
ured faculty members of the depari~
ment participate, some of whom have
sat inon classes by the professor being
reviewed.

These recommendations are re
viewed by the board covering the
department’s division (social studies,
humanities or science). TheExecutive
Council receives evaluations from
these other committees and sends a
final recommendation to President
Ferguson and Dean Duke, who make
the ﬁnal decision, usually following
the council’s recommendation.

Nakata, whose parents live in
Higashiosnka City, Japan, attended
Grinnell College from 1989-90. He
had transferred to Grinncll as a first-

Japan. Grinnell Seniors Difei Liu and Nathan Hadley
were also first~year students in 1989, and they fondly
remember living with Nakata in Clark Hall.

“We used to party together," Liu said. “He was
really friendly, a little shy."

“He was on somekind offellowship exchangejusl
for a year," Hadley recalled. “I think he really enjoyed
his experience at Grinnell, and he was sad to leave
because he was leaving behind some good friends,"

Hadley and Liu remember that Nakaia worked
hard toadjusttoGrinnellculture.”Hehad all these suits
in his closet, but he’d always wear a yellow sweater
tucked into hisjeans. We used to kid him about that,"
said Liu.

Hadley remarked, “besideshis general concern for
others, he was very concerned about what he did and
what he was able to accomplish in his life."

Liu concurred,recallingalatenightofsoulrsearchr

done anything with my life.'"

Hadley and Liuadmirc Nakala for taking initiative
and ”actually doing the things we dream of doing.”

Liu called Nakata’s work “meaningful and impor»

“He really kind ofexcmplificd the ideals ofGrin-

sonal level, I feel a certain amount of jealousy for
Atsu," Liu confessed, “There's a tremendous amount
of admiration and respect, and a cenain amount of
jealousy, because of not having done what he did...

“The commiunent to help others is something was
talk about a lot here—and we do a lot here, but his
commitment was supreme," Liu said.

Liu said that Nakala’s death doesn‘t generate
feelings of anger, but, “just a sense of resignation. ..
Atsu was trying to do something difficult if not hope-
less, and that‘s frustrating."

“I think itoughtto make people think about...the
harsh realities of what it is they might be undertaking,"
said Hadley. “On the other hand, it might give them
more of a cause."

Nakata was shot to death a few hours before UN.
