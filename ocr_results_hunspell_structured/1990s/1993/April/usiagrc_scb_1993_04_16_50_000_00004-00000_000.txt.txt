view, the criteria used and decisions
made are kept private. If tenure is
denied, the reasons remain confiden-
tial. This process conﬁdentiality frus-
trates some students,

“I think it’s very important to
know if aprofessor is staying or leav-
ing and why,“ said Aukema. The rea-
sons for tire diverse recommendations
from ttie committees involved in
Fitzgerald’s tenure case have notbeen
stated publicly,although speculations
are circulating among students.

The Political Science SEPC was
not informed of the Executive
Council’s recommendation to deny
tenure, according to the committee
chair, junior Richard Shrock.

The SEPC surveyed 40 students
who had Fitzgerald in class. Shrock
hopes that conﬁdentiality during this

student evaluation part. of the process
lead to greater accuracy by giving stur
dents interviewed the anonymity to
respond freely.

Robert Grey, Wayne Meyer and
department chair Ira Straubcr, the se-
nior political science professors who
made the department’s recommendar
Lion, refused to comment on the case.
“We don’ttalkto people aboutperson-
nel matters,” Grey said. Moyer ques-
tioned the appropriateness of faculty
members talking about each other,

special instructions from Buckley to
ignore students, and that he did not
have any intention to exclude them,

Parson said that he took every

reasonable step to make Buckley ace
cessible, especially by planning an
open reception with Buckley inSouth
Lounge. “If I wanted to have him in
Des Moincs and pander to special
interests, I certainly could have done

it,“ said Parson. “I went out of my
way to bring him here...

”It was a privilage for us to have
him here, not just for the College
Republicans, but for everybody,”

spiring approach to slip by,” she said.

Roughly between three and eight
professors go through the tenure pro
cess each year and, over a tenryeat‘
period, approximately 80 percent are
granted tenure, said College Dean
Charles Duke.

The administration does not put
quotas on the number of tenured lac»

ulty, he said. “Each case is considered
on its own merit,"

Not Representative?
Aukema and Free question
whether all the merit of Fitzgerald‘s
case caine through in the tenure pro-
cess. They criticized the criteria as
over-emphasizing publishing while

ignoring the “enormous" amount of
time Fitzgerald spends with students.
“He has gone above and beyond

the call of duty for me," said Free.
They also question the student
evaluation process, in which a mem-
ber of the SEPC summarizes and
analyzes the survey result statistics.
