Grafﬁti reveals subtle truths

By Nate Lange

HE grafﬁti in both the
women's and the men’s
bathroomsatGrinncllscrve

as a safe space for selfrexprcssion.
The difference between the two is
that women’s bathroom grafﬁti, nor
tably that of the Burling basement
women’s room, may be described as
“supportive" and “almost like a 53,
cred place," while men’s bathroom
grafﬁtiscemsiobemoreof“anoutlct
for things that aren't PC atGrinnell."
Senior Alisa Greenwald, along
with junior Kurt Dorschel, recorded
the bathroom grafﬁti in the stalls of
themen‘sand women’s bathrooms in
Burling basement for halfa semester
lastspring. The two were conducting
research for their Language, Culture
and Society class.
Burlingwomen'sbathroomgraf
ﬁti is a medium for the sharing of
feelings, favorite poems, songs, ad—
vice and positive feedback, said
Greenwald, adding that it is more
colorful, and involves more prepara-
tion than the men’sbathroom grafﬁti.
The men’s bathroom gmfﬁti has
amore negative feeling to it, convcyr
ing “fnistrated anger,” and punctu-
ated often by words like “bitch.“
“fuck”and“shit,"thoughitalsocon~
tains more humorrorienied grafﬁti,
and even some dialogue concerned
with confronting sexism, she said.
SeniorMar‘ian Saksena, who was
inu'igued by what she had heard of
the Burling men’s bathroom walls,

spent three hours investigating them
with a friend at the beginning of win-
ter break this year. The experience
left her With a bad taste in her mouth,
she said. The negativenes. ial and
sexualslurs, high incidenecofpcople
“cutting down" on one another, and
“scatological” obscssivencss she enr
countered were somewhat frighten»
ing. She found herself wondering
“Are there a lot of people walking
around Grinnell with these views?"
Saksena feels that the suite of
Grinnell men’s bathroom grafﬁti may
be a product ofGrinncll ’s politically
correctatmosphcre,whiehcouldhave

Senior Scott Muskin sees Grin»

munalanonymoussoulscarchingfor
identity as men in relation to other
men and women on campus." He
notes that while in other places it is
probably easier to express sexism
openly, mendealing with theissueat
Grinnell may feel anonymity to be a
prerequisite for any discussion.
Muskin advocates responding to
bathroom grafﬁti with one’s own
opinion, For him, the state of Grin—
nell men’s bathroom grafﬁti indicates
that we “can‘tjust assume that gcnr
dcr relations [at Grinnell] are ﬁne."
While the “public sphere” of discus-
sion should remain the primary area
of focus for confronting sexism.
Muskin said, we must remember and
address those who are inclined to
shrink away from this sphere.

fordcd an additional dimension when
the results of a recent study of Grin-
nell town and gown bathroom grafﬁti
differences, carried out by senior
Colin Kirkman, are considered. The
study involved documentation of
bathroom grafﬁti inBurling,atBob’s
Underground, at Van ’s Laundromat.

For instance, the passive ”(Mike) is
loved by mc"rcpluccd“llove(Mike)"
in several cases. Women‘s bathroom
grafﬁti in town did tend to be more
dialogue oriented than men’s, which
consisted more of separate remarks
in isolation from one another.

andatthehighsehool.ln it, thelargcr
difference is revealed to exist be
tween town and college women. In
nearly complete contrast to the sup-
ponive tone present in the Burling
women’s bathroom, women‘s bath-
room grafﬁti in town is characterized
by cutthroat competitiveness, often
centered around women beatingeach
other out for men, and sometimes
written using self-dcprecating tones.

not that different from college men's
bathroom grafﬁti, Kirkman said,
though college bathroom graffiti was
observed to demonstrate a higher de-
gree of intellectual snobbery.

Kirkman discovered one orga-
nized woman‘s bathroom graffiti
gang: The Big Girls of Grinnell,
whose writings appear in the batik
room of Van's Laundromat.
