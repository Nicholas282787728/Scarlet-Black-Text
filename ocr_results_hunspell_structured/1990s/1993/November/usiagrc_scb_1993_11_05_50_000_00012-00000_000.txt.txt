L in history, both the Grinnell

College men’s and women's
soccer teams won Midwest Confer
ence championships in thesame sea4
son. For the women it was their
fourth straight title, For the men it
was their first crown since 1989.

The men traveled to DePcre.
Wis, home of north division chamr
pion St. N0rbcrl,wherc they defeated
Lake Forest, 170, in double overtime
in thefirst round,and knockedoffSt.
Norbert,4-2, in the final. Thewomen
hosted their tournament and shut
down Beloit, 20, Saturday and St.
Norbert, 3-0, in the final Sunday.

“I saw two of the best games i
have ever seen played by a Grinnell
team,"commentedJothﬁtsch,who
has been coaching men's soccer at
Grinnell for over 20 years. “We
played well againsta good team and
we had a lot of luck,” he continued.

AgainstLakc Forest sophomore
Neil Goodspeed put the Foresters
away one and a half minutes into the

second 0\ crtime period. “Even
though I thoughtwe outplayed inball
control, It looked like it would be
impossible to score," said Pfilsch.

The followrng day, in what the
coach tennetl “extremely hOSlIICCDn'
ditions because it was colder than the
North Pole and we only had 12 fans
there,” the Pioneers rolled over St.
Norbert, 4-2. Freshman Chad Slew-
art scored twice, Goodspecd scored
once and Bertrand Bchm added his
first Collegiate goal.

Behtn’sgoalcame offofan innit
rccl kick and sealed the Grinnell vice
tory With four minutes left.
Goodspccd faked over the ball, and
Behm nailed a perfect chip shot into
the goal. “We executed as if we had
practiced Ilahundredtintcs,butl had
never seen that play before” Pfttsch
said.

One of me keys to the win, ac-
cording to Pfitsch, was Stewart’s
phenomenal play. “We used him at
midfield for most of the season but
we finally moved him tothe frontline
and the Goodspeed-Stewart combi
nation really paid off,” he said.

The Blue Boys feature strong offensive and defensive lirtcs. lllin
College has expanded its offense this year by improving the passt
game. The Blue Boys offense has been inconsistent. but the defense h
played well the entire season, keeping them close in every game.
Coach Greg Wallace said, “Illinois College has played well at tim
this year. We will have to play a good ball game in order to win. We w
have to overcome their strong defense and put some points up."
Monmouth overpowered the Pioneers with a strong ground gar
that gained 347 yards and scored five touchdowns. Sean Kane also h
a good day, throwing for two touchdowns while completing seven of

passes.
Grinnell trailed, 776, at the end of the firstperiod after Martin G

scored from two yards out. Monmouth then scored two more touc
downs, but the Pioneers battled back to pull within seven with Unl
three minutes remaining in the half. The Scots scored with 33 secon
10 play and lcd,28-l4.

The Fighting Scots pulled away in the third period after knocki
out quarterback Kevin Humiston with a separated shoulder and ti
backer Art Lopez with a knee injury. Grinnell was able to score twt
in the fourth quarter , getting the first touchdown on a 71-yard run i
Jason Werner and another on a 30—yard pass from Sean Cotton to To
McGuire.

“Their touchdown right before the half really hurt. We had}
scored to pull within seven, but theirTD took the momentum away fr
us. Monmouth’s strength showed in thethird and fourth quarters as th
put the game out of our reach.”

offensively, Wemcr led the way on the ground, gaining 126 yar
on 10 carries. Huiniston completed 9 of 18 passes for 85 yards bcfo
