RIVA'S VIEW 7

ARLITO'S Way is a dra-
‘ matic,oftcntense,movie

about gangs and the
street, and most importantly,
about tragic love.

The movie is based on the
novels Carlito's Way and After
Hours by Edwin Torres, When
Carlito (Al Pacino) is released
from prison after serving five
years of a 30 year sentence, he
decides to retire from mob life
and to “stay clean.” He goes into
business running a club with an
old friend and gets back together
with his former girlfriend, Gail
(Penelope Ann Miller). Things
seem to be going well. Carlito
plans to earn just enough money
to take him and Gail away from
their hard lives to something bet-

ter in the Bahamas, to “paradise."

But it is not easy for Carlito
to forget his past, and before he
or the audience knows ll, Carlito
is dragged into a messy, almost
impossible situation by his own
blunders and by those ofhis law-
yer (Sean Penn).

Carlito's Way is wellrrlonc
and captivating. Pacino does a
goodjob of portraying a softened
mobster; Miller is excellent as
his anxious and devoted lover.

Carlito’s Way
Riva: Mid (nulol'4)
Bill: *‘lnl'

head lawyer about to go over the
edge is surprisingly good and the
actions of his character are the
most unexpected and interesting
in the movie

Cinematography in Carlitu's
Way is great; the title sequence,

filmed in slow-motion black and
white, is unusuall Violence is
kept to a minimum, Voice-over
narration, used to provide vich
ers with Carlito’sthoughts,is un-
necessary and disruptive, butonly
reallyoccursatthebeginningand
end of the movie.

Carlito's Way is a tearrjcrk-
ing drama that can not be taken
lightly and should definitely be
classified as a “downer." Over
all, the film is excellent. if you
like to walk away from a movie
feeling sad.

—— BILL‘S VIEW —

Carltlu's Way is director
Brian De Pallna’s lake on crime
culture in New York City in 1975.
Fans of the Grinnell Disco Ball
wtll especially appreciate this
movie for its careful recreation
of 19703 style clothing, dancing,
and hair.
