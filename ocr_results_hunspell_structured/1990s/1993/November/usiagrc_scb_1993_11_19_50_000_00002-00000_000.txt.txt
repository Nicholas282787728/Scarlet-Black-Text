MAINTENANCE from page 1

Following a regular sched
ule of maintenance and replace
ment of parts will save a lot of
unnecessary breakdowns, said
Johnson. Checking the owner’s
manual and following the time
table inside is also wise. he said.

“Even in the owner‘s manual,
there is usually a list of specific
things to look for on onc’s car.
And there are usually pictures or
illustrations to help you. An-
other thing people can do along
with the visual inspection is to
buy a tire gauge and make sure
that tires are properly inflated
before leaving.”

When a breakdown does oc-
cur, having emergency supplies
inside the car and using com mon
sense is the best way to stay safe,
according to Jessica Stutman,
coordinator of the car mainte-
nance and highway workshops for
FEARLESS.

“There’s only so much you
can do before you leave,“ said
Slulman, “But you can have supr
plies and knowledge with you so
that you know what to do in the
case of an emergency.”

Suggested emergency sup~
pliesinclude paper, money,blanr
kets. send help signs, and some
thing white to tie around the an-

facing Asians today is the lump—

“It’s really important to not
forget thatatthecore ofour idenr
tiiy is our distinctions, even
though we are grouped together
under one label,” said ASIA ad—
viscriu Pong Lin. “In America,
racism and racial identity is cone
stantly referred to as a black»
white thing, Asians and other
minoritieslichative Americans
are kind of pushed out of the
picture and forgotten. Black
Americans who have a history of
slavery have a total breakage
from theirroots, butmost Asians,
though I can't speak for every-
one, have a sense of where home
might be and a sense of confu-
sion because it is not there."
Lin related a story about tryr

If you are stranded along the
highway. patience is important.
said Stutman.

“It’s important to remember
that waiting four hours is better
than what might happen to you,"
she said. “It could be a while.
The patrolman who spoke at one
of the workshops said that he
patrols on 80-mile area. That‘s
two hours right there, if nothing
happens to delay him."

If you are stranded, put up
thchood ofthccartoindicale car
trouble, and then posta send help
sign in a visible window or put
something on the antenna.

“If someone approaches the
car, crack the window and ask
them to call the police. Don’t get
out of the car and don't take a
ride with anyone," said Stutman.

In addition to maintaining
one‘s vehicle, make sure before
leaving on a trip that someone
knows where you are going and
what route you are planning to
take.

Brochures with more infor-
mation on highway safety are
available through FEARLESS.

at Tiger Ford and at the Grinnell

respectively.

American identity. Born Tai—
wanese but raised in Canada and
America. Lin was shocked when
she eventually went to visit Tair
wan,and everyone instantlyidcne
tified her as an American, she
said.

“When I got to Taiwan, the
places and people around me
looked like home to me and felt
like home, but I was a stranger to
them and always would be," Lin
said. ”It's been a long gradual
process of finding my Asian-
American identity.”

Participants discussed Asian
ritualsand traditions and the role
that tradition plays in their lives.
One final thought was agreed
upon.

“Asians probably have more
differences than (things) in com
mon,” said Lin. “Butitlsimporr
tant for us to look past these and
come together, especially on per
litical issues.”

The side supporting the

“Legally owned guns are not

According to the FBI and Nun

93 percent of all crimes involve

are illegally owned. This means
that only two percent of all vio-
lcnl crimes are committed with
legally owned guns,” saidGrogg.
