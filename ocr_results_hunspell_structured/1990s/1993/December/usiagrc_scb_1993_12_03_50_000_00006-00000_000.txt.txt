Thanks...

SINCE this is the last official issue of the semester, I thought I
would take a minute to thank some of the people who have helped
me so much. First of all, my staff. You have all done a greatjob.
Riva, led, Tom, Lucinda, Justin, and Howard, thank you. Thanks
also to all the people who wrote stories and look photos. Thanks
to Sally, Zander and Oliver for you artwork. Sally, good luck in
that contest! I would like to thank Andy Hamilton over at Sports
Information for giving us such good copy and Larry Finder at the
Grinnell Herald-Register for your newspaper wisdom.

I have to give a special thanks to by fiance, Jen, for staying
up with me every single Thursday production night all semester
long. You made an incredible difference. You were there when
I needed you, I can't imagine how I could have made it without
you.

Producing the S&B is, to say the least, draining. Aside from
the time commitment (20-30 hours a week), the responsibility of
the position sometimes felt like a giant weight on my shoulders.
It seemed sometimes to dominate every thing I did. I feel good
about what I accomplished, but I am also very happy that this
semester is almost over.

In the seven semesters that I have been here at Grinnell, the
quality of the 58:13 has varied a great deal. I have tried very hard
this semester to work on the appearance of the paper. We used
a standardized layout (much of which came from Jim Kropa) for
several of the sections in order to force a more professional
result. I'm not sure that we were always successful, but I think
on balance the approach worked.

I have a few recommendations that I think will help the
quality of the S&B in the future.

-Pay reporters: The 5&3 always has the problem of continu-
ity in the staff. Paying reporters would increase the quality ofthe
copy and would get people involved in the paper hopefully
competing for editorial positions.

'A journalism clam I'm not talking about making the 5&8
part ofthe curriculum with this proposal, but I think that if people
could get some formal journalism training here, it would make
the paper more professional.

'A bigger budget: Right now the S&B's budget is 52,300 per
semester. It is a budget comparable to what the GUM gets. This
means that I had to cover about 70% of the paper's operating
expenses through selling advertising. A bigger budget would
mean that the editor would have to spend less time on business
and more time on copy.

~Credt’rfor the editor: It is tough to carry a full course load
and be editor. If the paper could count for two credits, the
editor's life would be much easier.

'Newer, faster computers: We are allegedly getting new
computers in the Publications Building. They have been getting
ordered for weeks now, but I‘m not sure when we will see them.

I won't be editing the paper next semester. Hopefully I will
be doing an internship at the Des Moines Register. I will miss
many things about editing the S&B: the people I work with, the
importance of the job, and the pride I get every time I see the
paper on Friday. However, I won't miss the late nights, and I
won't miss the stress. To whomever edits the paper next semes-
ter, 1 wish you the best of luck!
