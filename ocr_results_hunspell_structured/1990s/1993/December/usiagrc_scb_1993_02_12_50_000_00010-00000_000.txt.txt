Horn asks for
Kropa’s apology

By Howard B. Horn

 

 

HERE exists a thin line injoumalism between what is morally
right and what is wrong. Jim Kropa took pictures of students
mourning as they left the Forum and as they prayed in Herrick

Chapel, In doing this, he crossed that line,

The First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution guarantees the
press is freedom to gather information and print whatever it feels
necessary to inform the public. Kropa's actions did not violate any
laws. Instead, they exercised bad taste.

The S Earle! & Black is the student newspaper of a small campus
community. The writers, photographers. cartoonists, and staff are
joumalists,butwe aresludents first. Forthisreason, we shouldbe more
sensitive to the campus community than professional journalists.

Some people. including a majority of the SM? staff have argued
that the journalistic line should be no different for us than for the
professional media. This can not he the case. If the 5&5 became
informed of a student having AIDS, and the Student did not want the
campus to know, it would be the policy of this paper not to exploit that
person. When the USA Today became informed that the lute tennis
great Arthur Ashe had AIDS. they were quick to expose him, despite
his wishes that the fact remain private.

So nowthatweknow thatthelineexists,thequestion remains: Did
lim Kropa cross the line?

We were all here when the professional press exploited the
Grinnell students over the Tammy Zywicki tragedy. We saw how the
press became overly obtrusive to us in our grief.

As journalists whoare students,weshouldbe more sensitive to the
campus in their time of grief; we should know that the press can be a
negative force in times of sorrow, and that the journalist’s quest for
truth is not as important as the wellrbeing of those in morning.

If you believe that Kropa is making an error by not apologizing,
there are several courses of action you can take. Write a letwr to the
editor, or stop reading the paper. Martin Luther King Jr. proved in
Mobile, Alabama that boycotts can be successful in changing policy
If nobody reads the paper, the policy of the paper might change. If
nothing is done, the same sort of thing might happen all over again.

To the Editor:

We strongly object to Jim
Kropa’s depiction of the luau at the
Sunset Lodge (“Week-

Why does he do this? Why invade
people’s privacy by quoting conver-
sations that have no relevance to the

For starters, Kropa
says beer was “forced"

on a prospective student by his
“hosts."Thislsnottrue.Nooncforced
beer on anyone; not the “hosts” who
live at 1221 Park, and not the
prospective‘s football "hosts."
Kropa’s charge is dangerously close

by unfair depictions of party-goers.

Kropa’s means were as bad as
his ends: he walked around the party
eavesdropping, and then ascertained
the identity of individuals by asking
other students who it was that had

said or done something. He did not
ask for permission to quote anyone.
Any serious student of journalism
will tell you that this is underhanded
and unethical.

Kropa‘s lack ofmorals andjour-
nalistic competence indicate that he
has no business being the editor of
the 5&8. It is an important posrtion
on campus and should not be occu-
pied by someone who acts so rcck-
lessly and foolishly.
