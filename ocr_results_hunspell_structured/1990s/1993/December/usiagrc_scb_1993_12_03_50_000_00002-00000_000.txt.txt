Time," and “This House Believes that Iowa is Heaven," the Union will be

Famous Political Scientist
Delivers Convocation

By Alan Osterg‘ren

ORLD renowned politi
cal scientist RobertDahl
gave the presentation,

“New Democracies: From Time of
Hope to Time of Trouble" at
yesterday's Scholar‘s Convocation.
Dahlis SterlingProfessorofPolitical
Science, Emeritus, at Yale Univer-
sity He is the author of eighteen
books on politics. Dahl has been
honored many times for hiscontribu-
tions to political science.

Dahl adressed the emergence of
democracies in the world in recent
times. He noted that since the 1950’s
the number of countries which could
be considered democracies has more
than doubled. He stated that one of
the primary conditions for consider-
ation as a democracy was universal
adult sufferage. He said lhatin many
countries traditionally thought of as
examples of democracy, such as
America, universal adult sufferagC,
in law and in practice, are relativly
recent developments,

Dahl warned that while democ-
racy has enjoyed many sucesses re-

cently, there is still a danger of non-
democratic regimes regaining power.
Dahl said that of the fifty-two demo-
cratic countries which have reverted
back to nonrdemocmtic government
in this century, all but two had been
democratic nations for less than
twenty years. He said that often
nations were plauged with problems
of debt, foreign economic
depondanee, and terrorism as well as
the usual problems that a country
faces which could cause new democ-
racies to fall.

Dahlconcluded hisremarks with
seven suggestions for U.S. policy
towards democritization. Dahl
claimed that if “background condiA
tions" were not in place in a particu-
lar country to facilitate democracy.
that there might be very little any
country could do. However. he said
he believed that the U.S. could adopt
a longricrm prordemocracy policy
which could be helpful, especially if
it was persued in cooperation with
other nations,

Dahl also held an informal dis»
cussion with students Thursday af-
ternoon. His talk was the last convor
cation for the semester.

Matt Abbot. and Dan Buettner
saw the show’s taping.

“It was one of the highlights
of my life," White said.

“Itwaslike Disncyworld and
a Michael Jackson concert all
rolled into one," Godine said.

During the show, White
threw a Grinnell College foot-
ball sweatshirt lo Zabel who not
only caught it, but also promised
to wear it on bowl day. White
said there is one more show this
football season,butsince itcomes
the Sunday before finals week
starts. the club will probably not
go. White hopes that they will be
able to go to the show next year.

Attorney's office, according to Of-
ficer Dave Sears, who is handling the
case for the Grinnell Police Depart-
ment.

"Ican'treally tell youmuch about
the case," he said. "Bull can say that
civil action is being taken, not crimiv
nal action. The case has been turned
over and is being ahndled by the
county district attorney."

Withoutacourt order, Sears said
that he release no other information
about the case because the infomta»
tion is "not being handled as public
record."

Ronfeldt wrote the lyrics to “My

April his friend Mike Gross was in
Nashville making a record.

other small towns on the way to
Tama," Ronfeldt said. “When I got
home] picked up my guitarandwrote
the song.”

Gross saw the lyrics and offered
to set them to music. Ronfeidt. who
claims he isn’t much of a singer,
agreed.

“I was blessed with words in my
head,butl‘mtoncdeafwhenitcomes
to singing." he said.

Last April, Gross went to Nashr
ville and recorded a 10-song album,
called “My
Home Town," on Star Quest Intcmar
tional, an indcpodent label. In addi-
tion to the title track, Ronfeldt also
wrote another song on the album
called ”She’s Gotta Be the Angel."

“Actually, we had to shorten the
name.” he said. “The original title

in a local band, Midnight Rain. And
of course, he’s a songwriter.

Ronfeidt gets a royalty of six
cents every time his song is played
on the radio, which he splits with
Gross. Though the payment isn’t
much right now. Ronfeldt is opti-
mistic about the future.

”Six cents may nolsound like a
lot, but it adds up. The guy who
wrote ‘Achy Breaky Heart‘ gotjusl

“You geta royalty check once a year
