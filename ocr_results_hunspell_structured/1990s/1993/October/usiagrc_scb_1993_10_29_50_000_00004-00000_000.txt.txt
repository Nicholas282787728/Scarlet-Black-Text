Grinnellians Come Out of the Closet

Coming Out Day is celebrated in the Crime]! community.

By Sarah Cornell

'REhere,we’rcquccr..l"
No matter what fol-
lowsinthisrallyingcry,

the message is out, and so are we!

Grinnell’s gay community cel-
ebrated National Coming Out Day
on October 11 with a new entliuslA
asm. The Coming Out Day Ball, the
saturation of campus in chalk, and
the grins on gay faces all day Mon-

Heterosexual Grinnellians may
wonder why gays feel the need to

comcout. Ifsexuality rcallyisn'tall
there is to being gay, why emphasize
ltwtth events llchomingOuiDay?
Coming out is not just a public dis-
play, but a personal realization.
Coming out means reconciling the
person you are with the person you
appear to be.

Telling people important to you
about a mayor part of your life that
has been hidden, lied about, or just
ignored is not an easy thing to do,
and can bequite painful. That‘s why
Coming Out day is necessary: recr
ognizing the day pushes everyone,
straight or gay, one more step tD~
ward understanding the gay com»
munity.

Grinncll's gay community as a
whole had to come out of a closet.
Although there were always a few
openly gay men and lesbians at the
college, the community needed at
home base, a “living room” for gay
folks like thcmsclvcs, as George
Morcll, director of the Stonewall
Resource Center (SRC) calls it.

FARMERS‘ PROBLEMS: Local Farmer Russ Greer, pictured with his dog Sheeba, reported that the
wet weather this summer has caused erosion to his iields and problems with his livestock.

Summer Floods Lower Yields for Local Farmers

By Matt Harbur

ROPS all across 10er have
C been stunted by cool and ex-

tremely wet spring and sum—
mer weather. The harvest is now well
underway. and farmers are realizing
the extent to which their crops have
been damaged.

Crops in Poweshiek County are
in better shape than many other court»
tics inlowa.according toCal Johannes,
director of the Poweshick County Exr
tension Service. Still, yields here are
well below the averagesin other years,

Corn yieldsarcavcmgingbctwocn
100 and 120 bushels/acre, according
to Clair Fenncr at the Malcolm Corop
elevator. Soybctin yields are between

35 and 40 bu./acre, on average. He
noted wide variations in yields, due to
partially flooded ﬁelds. Corn yields
ranged between 50 and 150 bu./ticre.
Bean yields have iangod betwmn 20
and 50 bu./acrc. Yields in other years
havc typically avcmgcd around 150
bu/acrc for com and between 45 and
50 bu/‘dcrc for beans.

Former said that beans this year
are good quality, but that com “is
taking it on the chin.” This year's crop
is suffering from lightrcolorod grain
and lmmrtturckcmels. Thecom isalso
a lower test weight, due to its high
moisture content.

Local farmers report that they
will have difficulty breaking even

Russ Greer, who farms west
oftown,said that tliewetwcathcr
affected his livestock as well 1iS
his crops. His cattle did not gain
as much weight from the wet
grass as he had hoped. Heavy fly
and mosquito populations placcd
additional stress on the cattle,
also preventing them from gain-
ing weight. Grccr’s farmlandtilso

Being out doesn’t start or on.
with onc or two confrontations wit
family or friends. Every time w
correct someone‘s pronoun for our
significant other, every time we de
fend gay rights, we come out. Ther
is the possibility of rejection eve
time, but at Grinnell, gays find iha
coming out gets easier and easier.

The openness of the Grinnel
community is admirable. Like thv

covery, and self-exploration,”

Ron Mon-ison, who farms south
of Grinnell, harvested corn until mid-
night on Monday. He believes that his
livestock will allow him to make it
through this rough season, “However,
it is tough on me to think that my

said.
