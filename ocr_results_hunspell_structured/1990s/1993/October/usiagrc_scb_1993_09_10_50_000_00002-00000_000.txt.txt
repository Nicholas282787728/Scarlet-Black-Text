According to Crady, cable will
cost the college approximately
$3,000 per year. He stated that the
money will come from a general hall
renovation fund, which originally
had money earmarked for the pur—

he had decided that cable will not be
connected to collegeeowned hous-
ing butthat decision is not firm as of
yet. Crady said that the decision to
not connect to college-owned hous—
ing was made because he did not feel
there was enough money in the bud-
get to do everything.

Crady said that SGA President
Chad Finke played a largele in the
process of getting cable. Finke said

that he proposed the idea to Presi-
dent Ferguson at a meeting which
they had at the end of last semester.
Finke said that Ferguson was posi-
tive about the idea and told him to
bring it up With Crarly. Finke, who
stayed in Grinncll this summer, met
with Crady 56 times about cable
and other issues. Crady said that
Finke ureally convinced” him and
when Cratly found out that TCI
would not Charge for installation he
went ahead with the project.

Crady Clnphasitedthalsludenls
could not splice into the cable sys
tem once it is installed because that
would be a serious violation of the
college's contract with TCI. The
