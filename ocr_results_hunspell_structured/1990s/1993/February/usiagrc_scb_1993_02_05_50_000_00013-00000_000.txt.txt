Media Distort Racial Crime

N display in Burling Library are several photos

0 from the Tulsa riot of 1921. The photos eon

vcy a story of horriric Violence and persecu-

tion, committed against wholly innocent blacks by

savage white mobs. One of the captions states that the

persecution and violence captured

intlie photosrepresentexperiences

which blacks in this country still
frequently undergo.

It is, of course, quite true that
blacks are still sometimes victim-
izcd by white racists (Such incidents occurmostoften in
those places where the liberal influence on social rela
tions has been strongest~naincly, New York). But
such incidean are exceedingly rare compared with
Violent crimes committed by blacks against whites. As
Patrick Buchanan has pointed out in his syndicated
column, the murder of a white by a black takes place
twentyrone times more often than the murderof a black
by a white.

And as Jeffrey Hart, Dartmouth College’s sole
conservative professor, notes in his syndicated column,
“In 1988, there were few cascsiperhaps teniin which
a white male raped a black woman. There were 9,405
cases of a black man raping a white woman.”

Such figures surprise people who get their knowl-
edge from the New York Times and the Des Moines
Register; liberal publications seldom report black vio-
lenee against whites, because it would eomport too
oddly with their version of race relations, in which
whites ceaselessly oppress and persecute blacks.

One example has been offered by the Chicago
Tribune columnist Mike Royko: Two white Chicago
policemen brought two black ehildren to a white neigh-
borhood and left them there, knowing full well that they

stood a good chance of being beaten by local racists.
The media, as could have been predicted, reacted by
furiously condemning the policemen. But they ne-
glected to reacttoaneven more hideous crime commitr
ted by ablack man against two white girls: On a bus in
Chicago, he stabbed them repeatedly with a razor
blade—mangling one so badly that she could have
stuck her tongue outwtthoutopening
hertnouth (MikeRoyko,“Racial Vio—
lcncc Cuts Both Ways,” Chicago
Tribune, December 11, 1989).

Moreover, in advancing
their version of American race rela-
tions,themediahavesuppressedinconvenienttruths—
the fact that the gang that murdered Yusef Hawkins in
Bensonhurst in 1989 included a black (he, in fact, was
theperson whohadpassedoutthebaseballbats wielded
by the gang); the fact that Rodney King, when the
police caught up with him, had two black companions
whom they did not harm atall (probably because these
companions did not assault the police).

“In the ideological world," wrote James Bumham
in Suicide a/‘Ihe West, ”anything goes.” So long as die
media are dominated by liberalism, oppression fantar
sies Will Continue to be passed offas serious coverage
of and commentary on American race relations. It is
encouraging, however, that independent voices are
speaking Outitlte Chronicles columnist Sam Francis,
for example, often provides his readers with a sharp
critique of the prevailing wisdom on race.

Sadly, racial hypocrisy isn’t conﬁned to the me»
dia.Lastspring, in response to theacquittal of the white
policemen who brutally but justifiably beat Rodney
King, Grinnell students rallied in protest. But if a rally
was staged in protest of the acquittal of Lemrick
Nelson, I r., the black murderer of Yankel Rosenbaum,
who was Jewish, I missed it.

 

 

 

Student Evaluation of
Faculty Needs Revision

T the present time, the Faculty Development
A Committee is reviewing the process by which
the college evaluates teaching. I propose that
procedure of faculty evaluation by
students be revised to include endrofr
course evaluations in all courses con-
sislingofboth standardized questions
and additional questions as individual
departments and instructors find them
necessary. These end-of—course evalu-
ations should be used in all personnel
rcvtew decisions as well as faculty development. They
sitotild also be used by departmental SEPC’s in their
recommendations for faculty review in place of the cur-
rent system otstndent interviews.

Tliocurrent process of faculty evaluation by students
is haphazard at best. In most cases, the decision to ask
students to complete end of course evaluations and the
format of diose evaluations are left solely up to the
discretion of the individual instructor. In addition, the
decision to use these evaluations in personnel review is up
to the discretion of the faculty member under review. It IS
difﬁcult to believe that this format produces objective
results,Thisproblemcoultteasily besolvtx‘lby mandatory
evaluations considered in faculty review containing some
questions that were not developed by the individual
instructor. implimentation

The current format of student interviews adminis—
tercd in person by SEPC members for use in interim and
tenureevaluations of facultyarchighly unreliable. Firstly,
the sampleot students selected for interviewing can only
include those students prescnton campus at the time of the
intervtews creating a sampling bias. Secondly, students

being interviewed aboutacourse they took two years ago
often forget many things. 'I‘hirdly, the evaluations are
subject to the bias of the interviewer. Finally, these
evaluations are only used for faculty that are under
review for contract renewal or tenure. Under my me,
posal end ofcourse evaluations would be completed by
all students in all classes, notjusta sample in the classes
of those faculty currently under re-
view. They would be administered
soon after the course ﬁnished, and
without the bias of a student intentio-
diary. The questions currently used
on the SEPC questionnaires could
form theframework for standardized
questions on evaluations.

This proposal would increase student involvement
in the faculty evaluation process. Some critics of student
evaluation of faculty feel this is unwise because of the
lack of maturity and perspective on the pan of students.
However,themajority of rescarehhasshown thatstudent
evaluation of faculty is a reliable assessment of teaching
performance(Miller 1974, pp, 30732). More fundamen-
tally. teaching effeeuveness is measured by how effec-
tively the student lcams. Who is better to judge that
effectiveness than a student‘.7 As for the matter of per»
spective, research has also shown that students do not
changetheir opinions aboutacoursc orinstruetor several
years after they have taken that course (Elbow, p. 5).

Finally, a consequence of my proposal is that the
amountof energy, time, and sheer paperwork on faculty
evaluation will increase. I would argue that this isjusti-
tied because the insurance of quality instruction at Grinr
netl is essential for the continued success and survival of
our school. I hope the Faculty Development Committee
will take this column very seriously because a revised
evaluation system With signiﬁth student input is an
essential step towards that goal.
