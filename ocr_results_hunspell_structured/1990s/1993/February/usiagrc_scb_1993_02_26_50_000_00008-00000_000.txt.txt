Molly’s Fancy plays
in Bob’s tomorrow

By Jessica Strettton

ILEMolly’sFancy is not
the only IrishrAmerican
band, it is the only one in

Grinnell; and probably one of few
having members from Hong Kong,
Turkey and Ireland. Named for and
originally instigated by former Grin-
nell student Molly Ztolnay, the group
formed last September and has at
ready given performances at Bob’s
Underground and at Java Joe’s. a
coffeehouse in Des Moines.
Besides the actual music, the
band gets its Irish sound from lead
Vocalist Andrew Sheehy and from Fritz
Gundlach‘s bodhran. Thcbodhian is a
traditional Irish drum which is unique
in the fact that it has a crossbar on the
back which can be raised or lowered,
muffling the skin of the drum and
changing the reverberations, The
change in rcvcrbcrations causes a

heightening ordeadening ofsoundor
even a change in tone.

Molly‘s Fancy has also Whitt
Orsburn on mandolin, Nathan
Kemperman on base, Ali Akgun on
guitar, Clement Ng on the guitar and
banjo,andRhstones, ﬁddler. Susan
MacMenamin is the band's manager.

While the band's main [oeus is
traditional Irish folk music, it also
plays old time, a type oprpalachizin
music whichJonix described as more
“backwoods than bluegrass." Band
membersemphasizethatthc musicis
Irish-American, not just Irish. De-
spite, or perhaps because of, the lack
of Irish bands on campus, the band
feels thaithcy have had it good recep-
tion from the student body,

Band membersarecurrcntly prcr
paring for tomorrow’s concert at
Bob’s. Also, they will return to Java
Joe’s on March 6, and open for Chi»
cago band Beyond the Pale on April
3 at St. Pius church in Des Moines.

Exhibit of Gibbons’ p
paintings opens this W

Trisha Howell

Lari Gibbons will be on display in the Forum Terrace
Gallery. The exhibit will remain up for two weeks.

Lari, a senior art history major, will be displaying a
selection of her prints and paintings from the last three to four
years, focusrng on her most recent works. Although Lari did
not plan the show as a rctrospective, she says that anyone who
views her work chronologically, following the dates on her
work, will notice a “definite progression" in her style,

Lari’s introduction to printmaking was made possible
through it stroke of luck, Since her father is ti missionary the
family moved frequently. She first learned about printmaking
from the artistrinrresidcncc zit a high school where she spent
only one year. The teacher owned a portableprinting press and
shifted Lari‘s interest from photography to printmaking.

Lari has continued to study printmaking during her iimeat
Grinncll and says that she has received excellent instruction in
the process. She noted in particular the teaching of Professor
Crowley. “I spent one summer at a program at another col-
lege," Lari Said. “Whilel was there] realized that my technical
skill rivaled some ofthe graduate students. They’d say ‘Let me
show you how to do this,’ and I'd already know how to do it.“

ONSOLIDATED. SanFranr

( cisco’s well-known indus-

trial/rap trio, has been nomi-

nated fora Bay Area Music (BAMmie)

Award, but they won‘t be at the March

6th ceremony to accept it if they win7

instead they’ll be at the herein Grinnell

at the Harris Center, putting on the con—
cert of the year.

Camolidated is a top-notch, pro-
fessional. multi~talented act. They com-
bine a powerful rapping style with irrer
sistible dance beats. Their 1992 album,
Play MoreMim'c was nominated for the
‘Best Urban/ Contemporary Album,’
competing with the music of popular
bands En Vogue, Too Short and The
Dixpurablc Home: ofliiphaprisy.

I heard about Consolidated a year
and a half ago from my friend Henry
Wheaton. A week later, I came acrossan
article in a fanzine called The Politics of
Dancing which ended up being an inter-
view with ConrolidatcdaboutLhcband’s
various political positions.

Perhaps Consolidatcd’s greatest
strength is in its articulate, political lyr-
ics. Their songs feature such topics as
gun control,vcgetarianism,racism,sex»
ism and the corporate music industry.
