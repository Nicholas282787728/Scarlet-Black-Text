Students also feel that Gordon's inllitencc has
caused a resurgence of interest in the theater depart-
ment. The student theater support staff is at its largest
size in recent memory. An influx of prospective
majors are filling classes, and a substantial numberof
nonrmajors are participating in theater activities.

“1 have never seen people be more dedicated to
a class lstagecraft] .” said Millar. “They don't want to
just blow it off. They

The improvements in
production quality has been marked. ”People are
clamoring to get into the shows, and we’re having to
turn them away" said Heller. “I take water aerobics
classes with people from the community and about
halfofthem went to seeADoll‘: House. Now. you've
got to understand that they’ve been seeing college
plays for the last forty years or so and they really have
alotof scope, and mostofthe class said thatitwas the
best play that they had ever seen productionwise.
They are clamoring for tickets, asking ‘How do I get
Muchmal tickets ahead of everyone else?m

“Pip has gone out of her way to make sure that
the dheziter department supports all sorts of perform—

“The facts are thatrv and Proteus are doing a hell of a
lot of work now—a lot more titan they did when l was
a freshman or a sophomore. We are getting supported
and the door is open to us it we want to use the heater
department to expand what we want to do,"

“Pip is the only prof that has tiny idea of what
goes on in the outSide world,“ said one student,
Gordon involves herself in professional theater pror
ductions, brings in specialists forseminars and makes
a concerted push to put Grinnell productions on tour,
all to “prepare slur
dents for the theater
of the nineties, so we
can go out there and
really know how to
do anything asked of

Theater students are exploring the possibilities
of“radiczil action“ to show their solidarity and their
support for Gordon. Everything from a theater work
stoppage to refusrng to allow administration mem-
bers to partake in theater activities have been dis-
cussed in various circles, and plans for some sort of
mass action are beginning to take shape.

Any action chosen may have widespread sup
port. even among students not involved in theater
activites; as one student remarked. “I'd definitely do
something because it means so much to many of my
friends that there is no way that i would say no. i
would definitely go in support of anything because I
knew it means so much to so many people.”

However, their jobs are mainly re-
stricted to locking doois, checking
machinery and fire prevention,

“Our people are not here as a
security force," said Waldo Walker,
director of Facilities Management,

No Plans to Increase
Police Security

Contrary to information on the
mailing to students from Student
Affairs, the Grinnell Police Depart—
ment does not plan to significantly
increase their coverage of campus.

“We‘re going to be around there
as we always have been." said Lamb.
He explained that there is “no set
schedule” or extra money budgeted
for police to patrol campus, but that
someone cheeks campus “when we
have people in the area." He said the
campus usually gets checked“some-
time during each officer’s shift,"
which lasts 8 hours.
