“Not with My Tax Money”

sardJonatlian Cummings, refuting the
argument that refusing government
grants to artists on grounds of “de-
ceney" is valid because the funds are
“the impayers’ money.”

To lay the groundwork for his
argument, Cummings first chronicled
the 1989 “conflagmlion” of contror
versy til the Nauonal Endowment for
the Ans (NEA),Si1u‘Ling with the 1989
Helms amendment, which withheld
funding from artists whose work was
“obscene,” conservatives proposed
varyingreasons forwhiehartistswould
be denied grants. Such reasons in-
cluded works which “may be Considr
ered obscene,” works which violate
“general standards of decency," anti
“difficult" works,

Cummings rejected the “taxpay—
ers‘ money“ argument, reasoning that
when the taxpayers fund something
such as an educational institution, they

are really buying into a “marketplace
of ideas,"

He likened this to arm funding, in
which taxpayers pool their tax money
to buy into the idea of free expression.
Saying that sponsoring art is the same
as sponsoring the artisLs' opinions, he
Said,“is like saying that when you pay
forasidewalk you‘re SPOHSOrlnngIzlb
ever is done on that sidewalk.”

“As with any kind of funding, there
will be some pans which will beneﬁt
some people, and oiherparts which will
benefit someone else," Cummings conr
tinned. ”The ‘mpaycrs' mono)" argu—
ment is dangerous because if it is valid

“Each person mnstdecide forhnn
or herself [what Values to use injudg-
ing works of ant" concluded Cumr
things, ”but they shouldn’t stop what
others can see."

Cummings is William J. Brennan
Fellow at the American Civil Liberties
Union Ans Censorship Project in New
York. He has written on such topics as
Robert Mapplethorpe, music video
censorship, and the pomyal of Afri-
canrAmericans in recent film.

ing an overflow. “It blew out the
vents and went out the overflow
valve," said Walker.
Representatives from the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources
arrived on the scene on Friday to
_ s the severity of the spill anti to
suggest remedial actions,
Frozen ground prevented thetuel

from leaking into the ground in areas
away from the fuel tanks, and much
of the Spill was picked up by fuel
absorbing compounds. Unfortu-
nately, gravel around the fuel tanks
allowed the oil to contaminate the
soil around the tanks.

“We Can't dig it out now, since
the ground is frozen,” said Walker.

“We havea lot of service lines in the
area, and if we dig now, the fractur»
in g of the soil could cause us to break
some of the servree lines. We‘ll just
have to wait and see what happens
when the ground thaws.”

”It will smell like a transit star
tion around here fora few days,” said
Ollinger.
