by Alex Severens

The Pioneers were at home
last weekend. playingina dire/erteam
tournament with non»conference
powerhouses. Fontbonne and
Gustavus Adolphus, All three teams
ended the toumey with 1»1 records
Grinnell defeated Fontbonne on Fri—
day, 1.0, but was then defeated by
Gustavus Adolphus. 3-1 , on Sunday.

The Pioneers were under-
dogs in wch game, as both teams are
ranked in their respective divisions.
After the Fontbonne victory Coach
John Pfitsch said. “It was a great
game to play in and a thrill to win.
This game ranks right up there with
some of the most memorable victor
ries of my career. “ Pfitsch had words
of praise for his defense which his

a great job back there and made very
few mistakes." Sophomore Beruand
Behm put in the lone goal midway
through the second period.

The Gustavus Adolphus
game started out to be the same kind
of dogﬁght. The score was tied 171
at halftime, but then things began to
unravel for the Pioneers. Midfield
leader Tim Edrnonds received a red
card halfway through the second pe-
riod. The penalty forced Grinnell to
play with only ten men, rather than
11, and Gustavus was quick to take
advantage of the mismatch. The
Gussies scored immediately after the
red card, then added another goal
near the end of the match.

After the 3-1 loss Coach
Pﬁtseh said, “We had never worked
on playing withjust ten, but I thought
our players adjusted beautifully. We

were unable to stop them cold. bull
thoughteveryone adjusted to the mis-
match well."

After fourgames in a row at
home. the Grinnell College men’s
soccer team will be on the road this
week against Cornell and Knox.
Grinnell defeated Knox earlier in the
season, 1-0, but has not yet played
Cornell. The Pioneers will shoot to
keep their unblemished 470 confer
ence record intact.

Edmond’sredcard willkeep
him outof the Cornell game as well.
so the team will be looking to return
to their winning ways without him.
Coach Pfitsch is very pleased with
where the team is right now, and he
thinks the Pioneers can keep up their
intensity for the second half of the
season.
