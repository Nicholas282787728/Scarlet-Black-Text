year wait

By Julie Kaster

Ttie Grinnell College Gay/Les-
bian/Bisexual Task Force began
meeting last month L0 examine is-
sues affecting the gay. lesbian and
bisexual communities on campus.

Theneedtoimprove thecamptts
climate for gay men. lesbians, and
bisexuals became clear to Presi-
dent George Drake following the
housing policy controversy in the
spring of 1989, when the debate
over whether the college should
allowsophomorestudentsinvolved
in same-sex relationships to move
off-campus led to healed demon-
strations. A number of frustrations
concerning the gay. lesbian,andbia
sexualcommunitieswereexpressed
by students in public demonstra-
tions and private meetings with
President Drake.

In response to the unresolved
lensionwhicharosewhenthel-lous-
ing Policy was not changed, Presi-
dent Drake appointed a large task
force to address the issues of the
gay/lesbian/bisexual community.
“There is a great deal weall need to
learn, particularly thesttaightcom-
munity,toimpmveGrinnell’scam-
pus for this community which al-
ready endures much discriminnr
lion," said Drake.

In December, Drake received
23 recommendations by this com-
munity, including a proposal to es-
tablish an ongoing task force.
Drake agreed to the recommenda-
tion, and the task force selection
process began in January.

The nine-person task force is
composedoftivestudentsandthree
faculty/staff members. President
Drake appointed Assistant Profes-
sor of Spanish MarkBates, Associr
ate Dean of Student Affairs len—
nifer Krohn and Professor of Reli-
gious Studies Dennis Haas. The
Human/Gay Resource Center Ade
visoryBoardselectedstudentmem-
bers Andy Coghill, Nora Bloch,
Shelly West and Guenuevcr
Gifford. The task force selected
junior Rachel Landsberg and As-
sistant Professor of Philosophy
Johanna Mcehan to fill the two re
maining positions.

The first issue on the task force
agenda is renaming the Human/
Gay Resource Center. President
Drake suggested naming the center
alteran alum. According to Krohn.
the task force is in the process of
formulating a recommendation.

The task force is also working
on revising the President's state-

bers'terms. Currently,halfof them
are on one year terms,and the other

Non-credit theater project poses challenge

By Tara Nea us

As Rob Neill and the cast of
“Avocados are Not Sold Here" dis-
covered during the past few weeks
and weekend, putting on a produc-
tion combining both classic and
original works is challenging. re-
warding, and fun,

This non-credit open-space in—
dependent project combined
works from Harold Pintzr's The
Hothouse, Richardll, poetry from
Ted Hughes and T.S. Eliot. and
original work from both Neill and
his cast.

Rob Neill, a senior, majoring in
philosophy with aRussian and East-
em European Studies concentra-
Lion, who eventually plans to go to
the National Theatre Institute, has
actedinseveralpmductionsatGrin-
nell and was most recently in
“Dracula" which was performed
last spring. During the fall semes-
ter, Rob Neill pursued his interest
in theatre by participating in the
Grinnell-in-London program.
While in London, Neill took three
classes with theatre professor.
Sandy MoffetL His idea to create
“AANSH” sprang from a paper he
wrote on the death scene in Richard
II while he was in London.

Regarding the logistics of the
project, Neill submitted various
proposals, and when his play was
finally accepted by the theater de-
partment, he receiveda budget. He
was then able to select his cast and
begin editing the ﬁrst scene and
incorporating the poems and ideas

he received from the actors and
others.

The actors enjoyed the inputthcy
had into the creation of the script
Cast member. Todd Erler said:
“Therewasa loloffreethoughtand
free association. We spent a lot of
time fooling around with stuff."
Kenton Guilhen, another actor,
explained: “It was alotoffun to do.
Rob's easy to work with...and open
to suggestions. "

“It was a lot of fun just to play
around withit" but there were“a lot

himself, is anOlVOd in Proteus and
thought that he “might as well have
another half hour...somethtng to
compliment it." He added that it
helped “lighten things up after the
ending and was a good chance to
see Proteus."

When asked about the difﬁculty
of directing a play without having
hadadirecting courseor much tech
nical experience, Neill explained:
“I‘ve worked enough with direc-
tors here and tried to follow their
example. I've have a good idea of

of ideas and we couldn‘t do all of
them," said Borg Bowman. Given
more time and money allowing for
extremely elabomte sceneryhethat
it would have been possible to do
“more far-fetched things."

“A lot ofus play with theatre and
have fun with it. and we wanted to
put out something meaningful wiﬂl
a good balance ofboth," Neill said.
”The whole idea was thatwe [could]
always add things. It‘s never quite
ﬁnished.”

The idea of including Proteus
for three of the four production
dates occurred to Neill when he
realized that his play was relatively
short and saw that the two could
fairly easily be combined. Neill,

how things should be on stage."
Neill found it challenging to do a
completely student-mu production
and said that he was grateful to
many people, like his roommate,
Joel Shepherd, who helped wim
lights,andlasonGunnink,whodid
sound.

The biggest problem for both
Neill and the cast was the short
rehearsal period which was just
about three weeks. This short in-
terim was necessitated by otherpro-
ductionsoompetingfortheatretime.
This meant that the cast had ashort
period in which to memorize its
lines and were faced with hectic
schedules upon returning from
break. “There was not much time

pressure. The play involved three
sections which met at different
times." said Guilbert.

The other major problem, ac-
cording to Neill, was when a re-
placement had to be found for a
priciple actor with only one week
left

“Brandan McClain did not have
break to memorize his lines and
was really busy (he was also in
MacNuggets which was puton dur-
ing the same week)". Neill said.
Neill complimmtm McClain for
his ﬂexibility and acting talent.

“I‘m really happy with the way
it uimod out I saw some things
differently and maybe would like
to try them out still," Neill stated.
“We have a solid production which
although confusing (its intention)
we know people enjoy."

The cast. like Neill, seemed
happy with the ﬁnal product. Erler
commented, ”I think the general
idea was to screw with other
people’s minds."

In additon to submitting projects
of this nature,aperson interestedin
directing has several other options.
One is doing an independent pro-
duction for credit. Another is tak-
ing the 300-level directing course.
which requires all participants to
direct a one-act play during the
semester. These directors are are
responsible for all aspects of the
work from n'yrouts to set to perforr
mance.

There will be eight one-acts this
semester. on May 2-5, and all per-
formances begin at 8 PM.

The money can be donated to
any department. program. student
group, or club. Every donor who
gives 51 or more earns $5 for the
Challenge Fund from the Alumni
Board. The goal ofthe Senior Chal-
lenge is to get at least 50% of the
senior class to donate any amount
of funds to the college before leav-
ing, in which case the match in-
creases to $10.

Thom Main, a senior who is a

member of the Senior Challenge
Committee, described the Senior
Challenge as a “good opportunity
for seniors ID designate a gift to a

Marcia Koester, the director of

like to have a few more volunteers
