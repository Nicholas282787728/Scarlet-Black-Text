atop MWC

By SETH KLEIMAN

Sports Information

Last Thursday the Pioneer kickers
not only faced a talented and tough
Cornell squad. but encountered ad-
verse weather in their ﬁght for the
Midwest Conference south division
lead. As sheets of cold rain poured
down on the field. the Pioneers re—
mained composed and focused as
they played for sole possession of
the division‘s top spot. “It was a
dogfight from
the first
whistle." re-
marked Coach
Jenny Wood.
“Both teams
were ex-
tremely in-
tense and I
knew that it
would be an
exciting game.
Neither team
wanted to re-
linquish the
rights to the number one spot in the
division." she added.

At the end of the ﬁrst half the 1-1
score reﬂected this thought and it
seemed as if the game would remain
close throughout. However. after a
crucial halftime adjustment the Pier
neers bombarded the Rams, netting
five more goals for an impressive
671 win.

“It was quite amazing." Wood
stated. “I was really happy that we
were able to score in the second half
with such efficiency. We executed
tremendously and our marking was
much improved. This was a posi—
tive game for us because we proved
to ourselves and others who the top
team is at this point in the season.
Now we just have to remain at this

season. ”

Netwomen Win 2,
drop 1 over weekend

Sports Information (Sfﬁce

Last weekend the Grinnell netwomen
posted two victories and one defeat.
Saturday the Pioneers defeated
Wartburg. 54, and William Penn. 6—
3. Loras grabbed a 6-3 victory in
Sunday‘s match. The results leave
Grinnell with a 6—4 overall record.
“Ironically, we played our best tennis
in the loss to horas. It was gratifying
to seeAmy Kaufman ‘00 win at No. 1
singles. She played well but did not
gain victories earlier in the season."
said Coach David Arsenault.

Kaufman fought through a close first
set. 75, and then sailed in the second,
642. The other two victories came
from Kim Knous ‘98 at No. 4 singles
and Knous and Aime Hopper ‘00 at
No. 2 doubles, “Kim also deserves a
lot of credit for the way she is play—
ing. She usually hits her stride about
this time of the season.“ offered
Arseneault.

1n the victory over Wartburg. Hops
per won a tight match at No. 2 singles.
6-3. 7-6 (7-4). Beth Dadko ‘00 won
easily at No. 3 singles while Knous
cruised at No. 4. Cythnia Robbins ‘99
notched the last singles victory in

straight sets at No. S. The ﬁfth point
came from a Knous/Hoppper win at
No. 2 doubles.

“We were glad to get the win against
Wartburg. I think we could have won
afew more matches, but Wartburg de-
serves credit for making the match
tight" said Arseneault.

Against William Penn. Coach
Arseneault used an alternative lineup
to claim the victory. Sarah Miller ‘00
didn't lose a game in her win at No.
Four singles. Ariane Kissam ‘98 and
Sarah Morsbach ‘98 also were victo-
rious in straight sets at No. 5 and 5.
The Pioneers grabbed thrw victories
in doubles as Knous teamed with
Jeannie Mackenzie ‘98 to win, 10—6.
at No. 1. Miller and Morsback won.
10-7. at No. 2 and Rebecca Schuller
‘98 and Kissam took No. 3 doubles.
10-1.

“1 think we’re making nice adjust-
ments and improvements,” offered
Arseneault. This Saturday the Pio—
neers travel to Knox to play both the
Prairie Fire and Illinois College in a
triangular meet. “I expect stiff coma
petition from Knox. They beat Eeloit
and Heidi! beat us.” concluded the
coach.

She commented.

Saturday the kickers remained at
this level as they snuffed out the
Knox Prairie Fire. 570. “Knox is al-
ways a good team and we have a

Men’s Soccer back on track

Two wins keep conference title hopes alive

By ERIC RIENSCHE

Sports information

After suffering through a three
game slide. the Grinnell College
men‘s soccer team rebounded this
past week. The squad picked up two
wins to improve their record to 3-1
in Midwest Conference action and
4,4 overall. Coach John Pﬁtsch‘s
squad soundly trounced Cornell on
Monday. 3»0. Three different Pio-
neers chipped in goals: Andy Lee.
Dustin Goot and captain Chad
Stewart. As usual, Grinnell's de-
fense was sound. not permitting

Cornell a single shot~onrgoal. “We
made excellent progress against
Cornell," remarked Pfitsch. “They
had a much better team than we had
thought. but we played consistently
good bail throughout the match."

In a home match against Wiscon-
sin-Platteliille last Saturday. the Pio-
neers again put on a defensive clinic,
allowing only one shot-on-goal. Lee
chipped in the winning goal for the
Pioneers 1-0 victory.

Regarding the match. Coach
Pﬁtsch said. “It was a harﬂrfought
game that could have gone either
way. They have a strong team and
we were fortunate to walk away with
the win.“

The second contest of the weekend
was another home game against a
strong Luther team. Luther boasts
some elite athletes and has been very
successful all year. The Pioneers got
a taste of that athleticisim immedi~
ately as Luther took a commanding
3-0 lead in the ﬁrst half. Luther cons
trolled the rest of the match as well.
romping to a 5-0 win. Despite the

loss. Coach Pfttsch remained upbeat
about his team’s play. "I thought that
they had some great players who
were just bigger. stronger and
faster," he said. Chad Steward and
Ryan McGary both played very well
and I was pleased with our overall
intensity. Theyjust outclassed us on
that day."

In preparation this week. the team
will be working on the conventional
short passing game to increase of
fensive output. In the recent past
Grinnell has relied on a riskier long
passing game to generate goals. But
Coach Pﬁtsch feels that this season‘s
personnel might be better suited to
short. precise passing. The Pioneers
hope to reassert their tough. swarm~
ing defense and employ their new
offensive strategy. If The Pioneers
have a good showing in upcoming
games. they could conceivably cap-
ture sole possession of ﬁrst place in
the south division. The Pioneers'
next home match will take place on
Sunday against Monmouth at 1:00
pm.

weather was terriﬁc. the course was
in good shape. and we had a good

deal throughout this season and I am
conﬁdent that they are capable of
performing well this weekend." said
Fairchild. “We just need to keep
working on our short game. The
competition will be strong. but if we
continue to remain positive. as we
have all year. I expect us to do well."
