Performing Arts presents
'fantasy' series

On Wednesday and Thursday
evening, the Performing Arts Com—
mittee is presenting a trilogy of inter
nationallyracclaimed‘Tantasy" films.
Wednesday’s offering is Harvey.
Jimmy Stewart's film which has been
withheld from the college market until
now. The plot centers on the Stewart
character’s companionship with a
human-sized rabbit, invisible to all
except Stewart. The production is
filledwith gentlehumorand sensitive
perceptions of how “nonnal” people
react to fellow humans who are difr
ferent from the norm.

Thursday evening will feature

two films often shown together in
international festivals: The Golden
Fish (21 minutes) and The Red Bale
loan (34 minutes). Produced by
Jacques Cousteau, The Golden F ish
istheenchantingstoryofaverybeau-
tiful gold fish purchased by a young
Japanese boy. While the boy is ab-
sent, the fish, in the midstofperformr
ingjoyful acrobatics, waits itself out
of its crystal bowl onto the carpet.

Cannotbedcscribcdpriortoviewing.
The film, its visual effects and its
sensitivity are very special.

The Red Balloon is a seemingly

simple,buttechnicallycomplexmulti-
award winning parable. In it, a lonely
boy rescues a trapped balloon which
appears to take on life-like character-
isticsasitbecomestheboy‘sconstant
companion. However, jealousy ex»
hibited by the boy’s peers changes
the flow of the plot and leads to an
astounding conclusion. Two of Di-
rector Lamorisse’s children appear
in the film, “along with the children
of Mcnilmontztntand all the balloons
of Paris.” Showings are Wednesday
and Thursday, November4 and 5, at
9:30 pm in Harris Cinema.

Head Candy to
Visit Harris Center

by Portia Sabin

I asked Mike Sangster of Head
Candy what it was like to be a band
from Iowa: “Pretty tough,” he said.
“One good point, though, is that
nobady expects much from you, so
whenyou show upanddowell,they‘re
much more impressed."

Not that a good show is much of
asurprise from this band anymore. In
three short yws, Head Candy have
had the kind of success American
Dreams are made of. It all started
when Mike moved to lowaCity from

Des Moines to get in on the town's
(slightly) more active music scene.

a few songs would be fun. With the
addition of drummer Jim Viner and
bassist Jim Vallet, they played a gig
in Iowa City and one in Chicago. The
success of the second show prompted
the band to enter the University of
Iowa’s “Battle of the Bands," which
(surprise, surprise) they won, Their
grand prize week at Catarnount Stur
dios in Cedar Falls yielded them a
demo which was quickly snapped up
by Link Records, a small
indepoendent label in New York City.
Their first album, Starcasler (named
aftera little-known Fender guitar, for

those oifvou who want to sound cool
when they’re famous), was mixed by

Heand guitarist DougRobertson were Andy Wallace, a swell chap who has
both playing in other bands at the also mixed for unknown folks like in the Harris Center. Schwa, a band

Some of you may even have caught
their video for “At the Controls" on
MTV during Fall Break last year,
Mike thinks thatoneofthe things
that sets Head Candy apart from the
rest of the new wave of alternative
indie bands is that they use different
tunings, getting away from “precon-
ceived notions of whata guitarshould
sound like,” They have a distinctive
sound: melodic, raw and not too dis-
similar from Nirvana, to give a refer-
ence point. But personally, I think
Jim Viner is a pretty serious asset. He
plays drums like my seventh grade

science teacher on speed. and that's
pretty cool.

Although the band has remained
true to its Latin American roots, ithas
been influenced by its fifteen yearsin
Europe. As one of the group’s mem-
bers describes their sound: "We would
want anyone listening to ourmusic to
feel that behind it are people of a
particular culture. But we don't want

‘ our music to be stuck in a time. We

want to achieve a Latin American,
Andean music, and anything we do
has that as its reference pomt, We
want to look at African roots, and
from our years in Europe we want to
incorporate Stravinsky and the won»

rderfulpeasantmusic ofthe Balkans.“

InLirIllimani has released more
than twenty albums. Their most re
cent recordings include, "Leycnda,"
"De Canto y Baile (Of Song and

- Dance)" and "FragmentsofaDrcam."
