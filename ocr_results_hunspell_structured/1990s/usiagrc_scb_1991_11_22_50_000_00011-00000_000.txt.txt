Treys aide varsity in Win over alums

By Terra Geiger

‘There’ssomething awfully pretty
about watching a three-pointer go
through the basket,” said men’s bas-
ketball Coach Dave Arseneztult after
the Pioneers 8861 win over a group
of basketball alumni. Trcys played an
important part in the varsity’s win.

ThePioneers scored 54 of their 88
points from behind the three»point
line. Leading the hot shooting team
was sophomore Craig Studer who
poured in 21 points. going seven-for»
nine from threerpoint range. Not far
behind was Freshman Steve
Diekmann who finished ﬁve»for-six
from three point range and buried
seven of his ten shotattempts to lead
the team in scoring with 22 poinu.

Senior co-captains Alan Thomas
andChrisJacobsen eachadded eleven
points apiece in the win Iacobsen
also had four rebounds and a blocked
shot

Sophomore Jason Francl led the

team in rebounding grabbing six. He
also had six assists and two steals.
Leading the learn in assist was Todd
Young with eight.

“If I have my top six [players]
shooting like that, I might be viewed
as a pretty good coach It‘s nice to
know that with that kind of firepower
you’re never really out of it,"
Arseneault said.

The semivformal atmosphere of
the traditional alumni game allowed
the Pioneers to work on different as-
pects of their game. The defense of
the alumni took the varsity team out
of their game plan, giving the Pio-
neers an opportunity to show off their
shooting prowess.

Arseneault said, "The alums were
not in as good of shape as I thought
they'd be We certainly have the ca~
pability to shootihut other teams
will extend and make us struggle a
bit."

He said that against teams with
quicker feet they still intend to slow

the pace down, and try to use the
inside play of Chris Jacobson a lot
more In the alumni game, Jacobsen
was not as much of a factor because
other options quickly presented them~
selves, Arsenault said.

“Against better competition he‘ll
(Chris) be more prominent,” he said.
“It just cametoo easy. Our patienceis
going to have to be tested With a
little bit better defense. we will be
forced to pass up more shots and it
will make us a little more willing to
do what we want to do.”

Arsenault added that, “If teams
give us easy shots, we‘re going to
take them.”

Pioneerlason Franc! saw the game
as beneficial, even if it wasn‘texactly
according to their slow-down plan.
He said, “We showed thatwe can run
the offense very effectively if teams
aren't prepared for us. It was at least
a good ﬁrst run to work through the
kinks"
