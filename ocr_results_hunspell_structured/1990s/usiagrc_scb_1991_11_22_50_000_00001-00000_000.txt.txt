SGA passes resolution

condemning

By Steve Clem

LastWednesday,SGAlointBoard
unanimously passed a resolution ef-
fectively condemning hate crimes,
such as the repeated swastikas Con~
tinuing to appear on Jewish students’
doors and in public areas.

SGA President Matt Stippich said
that the
resolution
was initi-
ated by

but the

nity as a
whole. “I
think that SGA is not only aware that
these attacks served to threaten the
Jewish community,butalso that they
serve to threaten the entire commu-
nity. It begins to pit us against each
other,” said Stippich.

Stippich pointed out that the reso-
lution recognizes the rights of open
discussion and differing opi 'ons
within the community, but not in in-

tinct backgrounds; and..
dinering opinions; and,

nity as a whole .

stances where an individual is anony-
mously attacked. “With the intellec-
tual level on this campus, we should
be able to discuss these issues ratio-

Stippich.

Chalutzim member Jordan Magill
echoed Stippich’s views on the hate
crimes as campus wideihreals. “I was

Magill.

Stippich added that he hoped the
resolution would promote commu»

as well.

“The senators are the representa-
tives of the students, and I think that
it says a lot for the Grinnell commu-

resolution," said Siippich.

Symposium examines future of China

By Sharyn Obsaiz

Democracy or communism, capi-
talism or socialism, uniﬁcation or
separatism A which combination of
these political strains best describes
the fates ofChina, Taiwan, and Hong
Kong’.7 The expens disagreed on this
question at Wednesday‘s “China in
the 1990’s ” lecture.

Thomas Robinson argued that
China has succumbed to the inevi-
table global tide of modernization,
demociatizationand“marketizaiien.”
Hungvmao Tien discussed Taiwan’s
transition to democracy, its useful-
ness as a guide for China, and the
many elcments of the prerequisite
elements which had to evolve in
Taiwan’s society before democrati-
zation could begin - elements that are
lacking in Chinese society. Byron

,IN THIS ISSUE

Wong evoked the anxiety prevalent
among the Hong Kong people about
the tumover of their homeland by
Great Britain in 1997 to the Commu-
nist, authoritarian Chinese.

“We are witnessing Lhe continua»
tion of revolutionary modemizations
that began with the Bolshevik Revo—
lution," said Robinson, Director of
the Chinese Studies Progiam at the
American Enterprise Institute. Mod-
ernization has made global revolu»
iion toward democracy and capital»
ism inevitable. He sees China “throw-
ing off the shackles of traditional so
ciety and suiving towards a better
life.”

Robinson believes that modem-
ization is occurs in stages. Since 1942,
when lthommunisLscametopower,
the Chinese experienced the quanti-
tative economic growth of stage one.

However. stage two, an increased
quality ofgoods, can only occurifihe
country adopts a democratic govem-
merit and a market economy. Equat-
ing modernization and economic
strength Willi democracy and capi-
talization, Robinson said China will
inevitably democratize and
“marketize” in order to achieve a
stronger economy.

“Once on the road to democracy.
you can’t turn back; you have. to keep
going,” Robinson added. He sees the
Tiananmen Square massacreas a tem-
porary halt in China’s evolution to
democracy and points to recent eco-
nomic reforms, including increased
privatimtion of businesses, the loos-
ening of trade restrictions, a growing
acceptance of the proﬁt motive, as
evidence of China’s progress.

“Timeis on the side of the Chinese
revolution,” said Robinson.

Taiwan‘s transition to democracy
has “profound implications" for the
success of the democratic process in
China, argued Tien, Professor of Po-
litical Science at the University of
Wisconsin.

According to Tien. essential fac~
tors behind uansfonnation from a
“quasi»Leninist state" to a democ-
racy include the growth of social dif»
ferentiation, the organization of so-
cial groups and associations, the

growth of the privatesector, dreamer-
gence of a middle class and the popu-
larization of education and the mass
media. Furthermore, he pointed out
that “Taiwan has had elections for40
years."

“Democracy did not come over-
night," Said Tien. while cautioriing
mat the process is still not Complete.
One obstacle for democracy is the
heated debate between ‘Taiwan-cen:
tric nationalists" and factions who
favor reuniﬁcation with China.

“While havingtodeal with ademo-
cratic transition from author-
itarianism, Taiwan also has to deal
with questions of national identity.
questions which are very divisive,”
said Tien.

Hong Kong also has to dwl with
worries about over uniﬁcation with
China. except, as Heath Visiting Pm-
fessoratGrinnellByronWengpoinled
out “Taiwan has a choice, but Hong
Kong has no choicei"

Great Britain’s lease on Hong
Kong runs out in 1997, and the area
willbercturned to Chirtese control, to
thedismay of both Briwnsandmiddle
class citizens in Hong Kong, accord-
ing to Weng. Under British control.
Hong Kong had grown economically
prosperous.
