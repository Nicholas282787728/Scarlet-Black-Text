asastudentliaisonto thcfacuity and
administration on curriculum issues.
In fact, the full title ofthe positionis
“SGA Vice-presidenL/President of
Academic Affairs." As a student

two duties are
essential parts
oftheoverallre-

SGA to serve
the student
body. To do the
job well, I be-

ministration.

My experience as a leader and as
a student representative is not lim-
ited to SGA activities, I was one of
four sludenB on President Dmke's
“Task Force on the Future," a body
of trustees, top administrators, face
ulty, alumni, and three other stuv
dents that made recommendations
to the BoardofTrustees on the long-
range future of Grinnell. My par
ticipation on this task force gave me
experience in working with admin-
istrators and trustees. I‘ve worked
with Student Affairs as a Student
Adviser,asamemberoftheStudent
Staff and Resident Advisor Selec-
tion Committee, and as a member of
the Housing Committee. I've also
worked with faculty members on
curricular issues as a member of the
Economics Student Educational
Policy Committee (SEPC).

In addition to these activities, I
am currently president of All Stu-
dents Interested in Asia (ASIA) and
an active member ofthe Multicultu-
ral Coalition. With this experience
as a base, next fall I won’t have to
spend valuable time learning SGA
and College bureaucracy and can
immediately begin actively work—
ing.

My experience witlt the adminir
stration, Lhe faculty, student groups,
and SGA itselfhave prepared me for
the ofﬁce of SGA Vice-president.
Please give me an opportunity [0 use
that leadership experience on behalf
of you and the entire student body.
On March 14, 1990, please keep
KOA in mind.

I am fully aware that the VP’s

for the President to vacate office,
but believe me, I’m willing to do
thattoo. I’dalsodoabang-upjobas

I’m also confident in my ability
