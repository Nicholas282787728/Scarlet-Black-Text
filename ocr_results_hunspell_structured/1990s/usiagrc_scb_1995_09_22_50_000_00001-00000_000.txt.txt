Tire 1996 House Appropriations
Bill went up for debate in Congress
last Tuesday. The bill includes die
largest education cuts in us. lnsto—
ry, decreasing federal aid to college
students by $30 billion over tlie next
seven years

Half of all college students in
tionividereceivefederalfinancialaitl,
and 75% of all student aid comes
irom tlie federal government.

By far the greatest cutbacks in
student aid will be in the area of
student loans. Lobbyists prDJecltl‘ial
the government will slash federal aid
by $30 billion over the next seven
years. The House and Senate both
agreed to cut $10.5 billion from the
Stafford Loan program, and the
House Appropriations Committee
proposed discontinuing the deferrals
on interest while students are en
rolled, as well as eliminating the six»
month grace period to defer repay—
ment after graduation.

House and senate republicans
have also proposed to put a cap on
the Federal Direct Student Loan Pro»
gram, tliougii it lias not been decided
at what level. Last year, tbe program
yielded $2 billion in savings for stu—
dents.

Tlie Pell grant will also undergo
eriotis changes if the proposals are
accepted by Congress. The Republl»
ans would like to see the fundingfor
the program decrease by $600 mil—
lion by increasing the minimum

dent aid

award from $400 to $500 and in»
creastngthemaximumawarclbySlOO
to $2,440. This would eliminate
280,000 students train tlie program.
Lobbyists also predict tbat the value

of Pell grants Will decrease by up to
40% by the year 2002.

Another serious cutback that
will a(fectsttldents is the abolition of
Americorps and other programs pro-
vrding opportunities for students to
repay loans through community ser—
Vice.

Graduatestudents have perhaps
the most to lost: from the budget
cutbacks. The in—school interestsub»
sidy on graduate school loans will be
lost if the proposed cuts are approved.
Experts estimate that a personstuclyr
ing for a PhD. and planning to teach
will pay an average of or $26,188 for
loans, Even a t\vo»year masters de
gree could cnst an average of $7,156
extra for loans.

Joseph Wall, Professor Emeri—
tus of History, described the 1890s
and the 19605 as ”the two decades
that showed the most radical changt
es in the College.” Wall and Alan
Jones are retired professors who used
their knowledge of history to draw
outthecomicalaspectsoftheschool’s
traditionduringtheirScholar’sConr
vocation yesterday.

The convocation commenced a
weekend of events related to tbe Ses»
quicentennial Anniversary of
GrinnellCollege. Today,thesounds
ortlie original lowa college ball will
ring in tbe rededication ceremony of
Goodnow Hall at 4:15pm, and will
be followed by an allrcampus picnic.

The purpose of the convocation
was to connect the past with the
present to ensure the future. ProfeSr
sorJOnesparaphrased President Main,
who argued that ifa college’s history
is not worth presetvmg, it is doubtful
ifthe college is. As Jones described,
Grinnell college has been legendary
for “maintaining a radical tradition,
and the Sesquicentennial [should]
celebrate that radical tradition."

Both professors are writing his—
tories of the College celebrating the
Sesquicentennial,concludingtheex»
tenslve research they have been con—
ducting over the past several years.

Wall '41 related the era of the
1890s and the inﬂuences of Presi—
dent oeorge Gates and George Het-
ron. “\Vhat Gates did was . i . to
allow students to enforce the rules,"
and thereby formed the first student
judicialcouncil. George Herron also
stirred controversy through the So—
cial Gospel movement by confront—
ing traditional religious roles. rio—
fessorWallconcluded that“Grinnell
has always had the tradition of social
reform."

Jones ‘50, L.F. Parker Professor
ofl-listory, extolled the significance
of the 1960s at Grinnell. He ex«
plained that after complaints of stu-
dentapathydutingpreviousdecades,
Grinnell students began exercising
voices of social protest. In this era.

lutionary tbouglit as tlae veliicle of
change. Both professors developed
the historical examples of creativi—
ty, initiative and critical thinking
which evince the College’s past
growth in positive directions.

Professor Jones urged against
complacency and quoted Gates, who

making forays into new countries,"

SGA budgets money
for sLudent act1v1t1es

TheTreasury officersoftheStu-
dent Government Association are
coordinating their goals for 1995-96
around stimulating more student
interest in the activities funds at
their disposal. The fall budget is
over $80,000, and SGA leaders are
advertising the availability of this
money for student organizations.

Treasurer Megan Hailey—Dun—
sheath ’97 expressed her concern
that students are not aware of the
money which is intended to pro—
motestudents' initiatives informing
interestrgroupsandenabletheirsuc»
cessful operation. Hailey/Dune
sheath. in her second term as trea—
surer, recalls how a large portion of
last year’s reserves remained in the
bank and subsequently entered a
slush fund in this year‘s budget.

“It bothers me that students don’t
know that SGA has the money out
there for them," Hailey»DunsheaLh
says. “The bulk of our funds comes
from the student activities fee," which
students are required to pay with g“.
rollment.

Unlike many schools, the stu-
dent government ofGrinnell is welle
endowed financially and is under the
complete direction orstudents. Bud.
get proposals from student groups are
approved by the Treasurer’s office,
submitted to the ﬁnance committee
and receive a final decision from the
joint board of student senators.

Hailey—Dunsheath’s frustration
arises because students are not taking
advantage of the unique opportunity
that the SGA and these funds pro—
vide for them. All she can do now as
Treasurer is wait for the students to
knock on her door.
