dismissal of French assistant, Bruno
Sanchez, Helen Scottassociate dean
of the college refused to speak to The
Scarlet and Black, saying that she
was not involved in the case. Charlie
Duke, dean of the college. had one
comment, “It's a personnel matter, I
can’t comment."

Jennifer Krohn, dean of student
affairs. echoed Duke’s words saying
that because it’s a personnel matter
she can’tsay anything about the mat»
ter. Just as no one can request infor-
mation about one's student records
(under the Student Privacy Act) per
sonnel records are confidential. The
only other issue on which Krohn
would say anything was thematterof
the lock change at French House. She
said that the house was locked for

what to do next

of explanations for what happened in

Black Enough? Card controversy shakes CBS

by Christopher Fletcher

Are you ”black enough" was the
question, but underneath it were two
more importantand grating questions:
what does it mean. and why should it
have to be asked?

Concerned Black Students
spokesperson Dauriee Coaster has
been asked to step down from her post
and offer apublic apology for actions
undemken with other black students,
actions that she personally deemed to
be of beneﬁt to Grinnell‘s African
American community, a community
she feels should address the issue of
identity and what role, if any, it plays
in the community. Instead, that com-
munity seems to be divided
frauicidally intoan arbitrary andhurt—
ful system oflabeling.

Coaster and her colleagues dis—
uibuted cards to about ﬁfty people on
campus, including a number of stur
dent leaders and administrators. The
cards Said either "Black Enough" 0r
“‘Almost‘ BlackEnough.” Each card
bore a year of importance in black
American history.

While the propaganda received
an unanticipated negative response,
she stands by what she and other
students did. She discussed how Af-
rican Americans have gone to an ex»

themselves as African Americans
on the basis of personal issues like

ties that Coaster feels distract from
African American identity.

then that is what is most important.
and one should have the support of
CBS and the black community. She
decries how African Americans have
been “treating each other like we
actually need a card to validate our-
selves." The purpose of the “Black
Enough" cards, then. was to raise
this issue in a striking manner and
hopefully facilitate a dialogue about
the issue, not about the personal lives
of dlosc involved.

Those involved had hoped that
the provocative tactic would moti-
vate people whom are viewed as
intelligent students and administra-
tors to regard this issue of division
within groups more seriously. In-
stead, says Coaster. some who re—

Grinnell ranked 14th

Grinnell College has been cited
as foltrteenlhbestarnong 140 national
liberal ans colleges, and one of five
such schools ranked as “best buys,"
according U.S. News & World
Report’s Sept. 28 “America’s Best
Colleges" special report. Grinnell
has been ranked by the magazrne as
being among the top liberal arts col-
leges since 1985.

Over 1300 schools wereincluded

in the study which combines SIELiSlIr
cal data with the results of a survey
of academic reputations.

The top three colleges, accord-
ing to the ranking, were Williams,
Amherst and S warthmore.
Grinnell’s archrr‘ival Carleton was
ranked twelfth. Grinnell was ranked
second after Washington and Lee in
the “best buy" category.

among African Americans and
whites). took the card as a personal
attack.

Coaster points out that the kind
of divisiveness found in the African
American community is as great a
problem within other groups. She
mentioned the black idea of the
“oreo” or the “Uncle Tom," some-
one who is black on the outside but
“white” on the inside. The Latino
community has its own analog to
that. the “coconut" Said Coaster.
this sort of labeling is hurtful and
detrimental for all communities.

The unexpected anger and con»
troversy over the cards has provoked
the circulation of a petition for
Coaster's impeachment from her
CBS post. She has been cited as
“dividing the entire black commu—
nity, as well as CBS." Those in
volved acted in their own private
time outside the realm of CBS to
raise awareness of an issue that they
feel needs desperately to be ad
dressed.

Coasterhasrefusedtostepdown.
Constitutionally, the impeachment
petition requires signatures from two
thirds of voting CBS members to
force her from the spokespersons
post.

Coaster said that her opponents

kind of dialogue that the cards were

she can for the betterment of her
