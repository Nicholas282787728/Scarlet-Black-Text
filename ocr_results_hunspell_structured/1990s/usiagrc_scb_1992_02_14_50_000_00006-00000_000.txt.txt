The hate continues

Unfortunately, wemiistagain bring up the siibjectofswuxtikas. When we
left last semester there was an awful tension in the ILll’iViOlCi'lI physical
attacks were being rcportcd, and the genocidal gmffiti frequently appeared
in the dorms. Most would agree, it was an uncomfortable environment to
exist in.

Unfortunately its well, it is notjust at Grinncll that this subject comes up,
Many colleges all over the country have reported tension on campus, and at

new surge of racism. Knowing that
students of the past worked so hard to
S TAE E
E D ITO RIAL

eliminate such hatreds, rcccntcvents
on campus‘ seem quite a step back-
wards. The reasons behind the new
racism is hard to figure: is it a trend
caused by recent the economic reces»
sion’l Are people rebelling against the ”PC" behavior that is expected on
campuses?

We left Grinnell last semester hoping to come back to a fresh start. Some
things have improved: there have been no reports of violence, or town and
gown friction. In general, die atmosphere seems less tension fillcdino one
seems eager to recreate last semesters environment. However, swastikas
continue to appear. Already this semester four swastikas were drawn. All of
them were in Dibble. two appearing on the stairway halls, and two on a
Jewish resident‘s door. The most recent defacing occurred on a posted
petition which denounced the offensive swastikas.

What can we say? What will make the swastikas, and the hatred behind
the ink marks, disappear?

In response to the swastika appearances last semester articles were
written. letters were printed. and editorials tried to respond, Meetings were
held and petitions signed. For some reason, the swastikas continued,

To reiterateour disapproval might seem tiresome or pointless, but we feel
that to let the swastika’s return to our campus unnoticed would be worse.
Respond with letters, continue meeting, search for new ways for the
disapproval to be known. Eventually, hopefully, the message will sink in,

LETTERS TO TI—I_E_ EDITOR
”i‘ll be ”the one Without the beer”

To me utlitor,

I would like to thank Elisa Martin
for her column last week. Her lion-
esty about her drinking habits was
refreshing in the midst ofGrinnell’s
denial of an alcohol problem on this
campus.

This campus gives off powerful
vtbes to the tune of “drink, drink,
everybodydrinks,"Anditgetsharder
and harder for a nonvdrinker to make
up excuses to get “social” drinkers
offhcr/his back, Don'tgetmewrong,
nooneforcesanyonetodnnkntGrin-
nell, but it’s obvious that use of alco-
hol permeates the metal life of the
student body.

Please don’t for one moment mis-
take me for a “Women’s Christian
Temperance Union’ttype either. I
am what I would like to think is an
“educated from personal experience
drinker who now chooses to have a
glass of wine now and then.” I have
no problem with alcohol, I have a
problem with misuse and overuse of
alcohol. And I know what misuse
and overuse of alcohol can do be-

cause I've had alcohol potsoning,

I’m pretty sure I started “social"
drinking (to. getting trashed) when I
was l-t or 15. B' .icully I can't rc—
member being in high school and not
drinking. ltwas a weekend thing that
ldid wtth the bad boys. Ididn’tdoit
to fit in or to feel more relaxed around
people to whom I was attracted, I did
it because it was titunn good fun.

When I got to Grinncll, I was
amazed. What luck! No one cared
thtttl was only 18 and no one cured
that I got bombed every weekend!
SAS handed Inc bccr aftcrbeerduring
New Student Days! I was in “Social”
drinking heaven. And my alcohol
tolerancecontinuedtogrowandgrow.
Soon I could keep up with the jocks I
hung around with 7 guys who were
twice my Size. I was never one to shy
away from a game of Mexican or
Three Man, and I always drank for
my losses, even when the others said
they’d spot me the beer and a halfI
was behind.

The point is ihatI thought I knew
my limit. Iknew when to cool it and

maintain for the rest of the night. i
knew how muny has too many.

But one night at the end 01' my
sophomore yetir, I forgot that I had a
limit. I drunk on South Campus. I
drank in Gardner. I drank atThc Bar,
I drank at an offrcampus party. I
played drinking game after drinking
game, I lost track ofhow many beers
I‘d had.

And then I passed out cold on a
bathroom floor and stopped breath-
ing. And someone had to save my
life.

Red, White and blackened beef

Go to this school long enough and
you’ll hear all sorts of complaints of
student apathy, Yeah, like you really
care.

Butis apathy really all that terrible
athing when you’ve gotstudents with
some of the most whacked ideas this
side of the Louisiana gubenaton'al
race trying to dmrn up campus sup
port? Nah, ignore ‘em. Pretty soon
they'll realize that they weren ’t good
enough to get into an Ivy League
school no matter how much theyclaim
they didn‘twant to, and they can’t stir
up any support for their causes no
matter how many weak articles they
write or how much SGA money they
ask for.

Heck, you’d probably think I was
writing about the Spectator crew the
way I was goin’ off, butI'm not. In
case you missed it, this week’s award
for the dumbest-ideas-that-probably-
got-as-much-campus-support-as-
they-meri ted oughta go to the United
Auto Workers in Newton. one espe-
cially lame S and B column, and a
group which this author may or may
notbepart of, the anonymous “Safari
Sisters.”

It’s not like all these people are
getting together in the Forum coffee—
house, but you gotta bet they‘d have
a lotin common. All threemade their
presenceknown recently, Those silly
UAW guys grabbed headlines after
deciding to take their frustrations (no
doubt related to building boring ol’
kitchen appliances when all their
Union Brothers get to build really
boss Camaros and Blazers) out on a
Subaru, bashing its heathen Japanese
innardswithasledgehammer. Ishud-
der to think what they would have
done to a Japanese dishwasher.

The neanderthal-csque display in
the next county was followed by the

Eric Bucks

equally heavy-handed s and B colr
umn, “Hurrah for Uncle Sam and
AuntGage."Itspoke of abuttrkickin’
economy if only federal law man-
dated we ail buy cars that guys in
Newton won’t beat up. Washers and
dryers too.

The Safari Sisters threw an all-
campus pany, so to speak. Honest
they did, but you were probably too
busy ignoring it or throwing up in
some bathtub in Rawson (oh yeah,
THATwe/ekend.)Anyhow,yougotta
figure some of the sparse attendance
attheSafarilam wasdueinpartiothe
ever»so»hospitable invitation at the
bottom of their ﬂiers, "Don’t come if
you can’tidentifyl"1fyou can’tiden-
tify with what’.7 A safari? Safari
Sisters? My brothcris in Kenyadoes
that count?

The best that can be said for all
three ideas reaching the public is that
most people seemed to sleep right
through ‘em. Nobody, as I‘m sure
one of those insightful Quad Polls
would reveal, left campus to help the
Newton guys kick some Subaru butt.
Few, but not many, felt they could
identify with whateverthe Safari Sis-
ters were looking for, or if they did
they suredidn’tstick around the party
long. And as for the column, yeah,
like everyone’s gonna read some
thing about Aunt Gage.

So let’s all takea momentand give
a collective yawn to those who would
have us believe they have a clue.
Smash aJapanesecarand buy Amerir
can? The most recent example of
American knowrhow this campus has
seen is that engineering paragon, the
I-IarrisCenter. Taili'insorneon lights,

you spot the difference.

Pass laws saying we oughta only
buy American? I’m notdoubting that
a liberal arts education would leave

ing your column (no doubt on an
American made computer) you didn‘t
mention that most valuable of US.
commodities, the American educa-
tion.

Yep, every good American should
learn their Socrates right here under
the stars and stripes, no? Anybody
thinking of off campus study like
Grinnell-In-Londonoughlabethrown
in leg irons. The nerve, spending the
almighty dollar on foreign soil that
should stay right here at home and
patch up flag-wavin’ Savings and
Loans. Likeitsaid in thecolumn,”So
those multiculturalism freaks don‘t
like it.” You betcha. Time to put an
end to all that Junior-Year-Abroad
silliness and get our college students
backhereinvestinginaquality Ameri-
can product like American board
plans. HoorayfortheRed,Whiteand
Blackened Beef,

And while we’re on the subject of
multiculturalism, what about that
ciazy Safari Jam? Yeah, you gotta
love SGA funds being used for a so-
callcd allacampus party that instead
of inviting the entire campus, sug-
gested that somepeople weren’t wel-

dent Feurgeson’s pledge to improve
Grinnell would bequite a chore iflhe
