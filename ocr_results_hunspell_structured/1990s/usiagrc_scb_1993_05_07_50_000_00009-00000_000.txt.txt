——F0rgetting “GOD”—

sodomites and lesbians by President Clinton. His argu-
ment,despitcitsBible-quotingpicrlictahilityanilitswcepy—

forgetting about all the ravages wrought on
humanity across the millcnia of godism's des-

disastrous. Forgetting about the forty wars and

But maybe if we forgot the ways of thinking

A helpful message to seniors

DO you really want a job?

Ifso, having an answering machine is advised

By Anne L Geissinger

F'fEcheksofchcckingthe

mail, I was impatient to

know if I had a job after
graduation,Situngmyselfdown with
a hefty list of possrble ettiployers, I
began calling.

“Hello, my name is Anne Gets-
singer. I sent. you my resume about
oncmonthago,and wasworidering if
any positions had opened."

To my surprise, the secretary
recognized me immediatelyand sai
“Oh, Ms. Geissingcrl We are terribly
sorry, but we have tried to call you
several times for an interview and
could never get a hold of you. Our
interview period has closed new, and
wearepresentlymakingdecisionson
who to hire. I am so sorry!”

In complete shock, [thanked her
and hung up. All I could think ofwas
that if I had had an answering ma-
chine, I would have gotten the mes-
sage and could have had a full—time
job already lined up.

I just couldn’t believe it The
emelty of it 21171 missed a phone
call. so I wasn’t eligible for ajob,.,

Clearing my throat and wiping
away the tears, I continued to make
phone calls. The very next place I
called said that I was being consid
ered for a position, and did I have a
phone number where I could be cone
tactcd in the event that they should
care to interview me? Promptly, I
gave them the phone number of a
friend who has an answering ma
chine, not wanting to miss another
job opportunity.

What am [suggesting then, to
the student who really wants to get a
job? Two things: 1) getan answering
machine, and 2) get off your buttand
call around after your resume.

People who rely on their resume
todoalldietatkingaren‘tgoingtoget
half the‘job offers that people who
take the initiative to call will get. If
you call, you are almost guaranteed
to get an interview, which gets you
that much closer to landing thejob. It
is that simple.

There is a happy ending to my
story. I will be working a part time,
volunteer position in a physical
therapy center for the summer and
will start a full time job as a physical
therapist aide in August. Hooray!

Africa ’s Brightest Chance

OST pundits now argue that the postrCold
M War alienation of Africa by the Big powers
marks the continents darkest hour. WiUi
their resolve to bail out the East Bloc from collapse, and
their own economies in shambles, the big powers no
longer consider Africa gcorpolitically or economically
significant. So billions of dollars of economic aid flow
to Eastern Europe, whilst Africa in severe need is being
ignoredi‘bcmg marginlized,” as the cliche goesﬁand
is therefore gonna hurt.

This assessment is not without someiustification.
The decades-old Cold Warsaw Washington generously
rewarding countries like Kenya, Zaire, and Liberia that
gave them rntlimry bases, and the Soviets relentlessly
armingelicntslike Mengishlu,DosSantosand Chissano.
But the problem with this popular notion is that it
overlooks the catastrophic
sufferings of the African
people thaicamc with it. No
sooner had Africans cel-
ebrated their triumph over
colonialism than they had
to deal with the intrusion of great powers who made
Africans proxies in the Cold War.

Indeed, even the much touted economic assistance
was mostly military aid. The bigpowcrsarmed Africans
to the teeth, to cut each other‘s throat. Existing differ
ences quickly mushroomcd into armed insurgenciesi
wtth big military and logistic support from the patron
warriors. That was how rebel movements in Ethiopia,
Angola, Sudan and Mozambique—just to mention a
fcwihelped tear their countries apart. The skeletal
figures of young Africans shown on TV, are the direct
product ofthc Cold War. Thank God the stupid, sense-

W/t/A’W/V/E/Ofﬂff’fdf/Vf

less war has come to a peaceful end. Even the former
arch rivals cheerfully embrace each other: the new
bond of co-operation between the United States and the
Soviet Union is unprecedented.

And now Africans can celebrate a second libera-
tion victory, this time from the encumbrance of the
Cold War—though Angola is still burning, and South
Africa has yet toattain Black majority rule. Forthe first
time in many centuries, Africans have a chance to
brave through a new world of nonrinterferenceﬁthe
long-awaited opportunity to prove that they can make
iton theirown. But theconsensus in the Westem media
is to the contrary: Africa is going to hurt more because
the rich powers are no longer interested in its affairs.
The media forgetsthatthCSO»Called“lnlcrcsl”in Africa
in those years grew outofselﬁsh Cold War politics, not
African interests.
So the fading of
this “interest" is a
blessing, not a
bane to African
progress.Afi-icans
are already counting their blessings froin the disman-
tling of the Berlin Wall: from Benin to Ghana, and to
Kenya, democratic reforms are sweeping across the
continent. Even such perennially troubled spots as
Mo7ambique and Ethiopia are now witnessing peace.

The Cold Wariprobably the most protracted and
costliest world wariwas a catastrophic human error,
particularly for Africa and the rest of the developing
world that have bome the bulk of its pain and phnish-
merit. African nations, though notcntirely free—have
a better chance than ever before to seize the moment
and register their own economic miracles.
