gram as itexists today. “In the early
years, you had to have someone who
was willing to come in widt a great
deal of courage and stick—to-it-
iveness," Gordon said.

Bakken said that Voertman has
given the Dance Program continuity
and experience. “She really has be
come an institution in herself,”
Bakken commented. “People came
to Troupe that never had danced
before andnow they’re performing,"
Bakken said.

Admissionscounselorand Grin-
nell alum Dorothy Palmer, a meme
ber of Orchest'r during Voertman’s
first year teaching here, shares
Bakken’sview ofVoertman. “She’s
truly an institution in dance," said
Palmer, who called Voertman a role
model.

Palmer‘s memories of long
hours preparing for the spring con-
cert are not unlike what Bakken,
Saiyid and the other dancers are ex-
periencing today. “You'd dance all
evening long and every afternoon; it
just took a great deal of work. We
were a very small troupe, too, so you
wanted to give it your all,” Palmer

said.

Another member of
Voertman’s first Grinnell Dance
Troupe, Sandra Jamroz, went on
to found her own dance company
in New York City, and credits
Voertman with “planting all the
seeds." Jamroz said ofVoertman.
“She was the one that helped me
to get started. I learned a tre-
mendous amount from her."

Jamroz said that before she
came to Grinnell, she had not
considered dance as a career. “In
Grinnell I got very interested in
dance. It became a way to ex-
press myself as well as an art
form,” she said, From 1969 to
1978. the Sandra Jamroz Dance
Company gave performances in
New York's Cubicula avantr
gardc dance theatre, St. Mark’s
Church and the Theatre of the
Open Eye, among others. Today,
Jamroz is a movement therapist
in New York.

Voertman. To McClaurin. prepar-
ing for the Dance Concert was a
glamorous diversion from the po-
tentially isolating world of Grinnell
academics. “The DanceTroupe was
always a glint of excitement in the
midstofwhatcould be a pretty mun-
dane experience," McClaurin said.
“Bottom line—it was fun."

Palmer culled Voertman “an
amazing woman" and said that she
still sees Voertman as she knew her
in 1959. “When you meet someone
that really impresses you, that per»
son sortofremainsatthatmomentin
time,” Palmer said.

MCCiaurin sees Voertman the
same way. “I get a kick out of the
fact that she looks almost the same
as she did,” McClaun'n said.

Open Teaching Style

Voertman’s students consis-
tently commented about her open
teaching style, which allowed room
for a variety ofskill levels. “She had
a way of making the must spastic
person feel comformble,” McClaurin
said.

The option for any member
of the Dance Troupe to choreo-
graph a dance is one of the most

meaningful elements of the cre-
ative freedom that Voertman of-
fers. according to her students:
Palmer said that she appreciated
“the opportunity to do something
very creative.” Saiyid said, “You
can be creative as you like under
her; she never stiﬂes.” Bakken
commented, “She really encour-
ages you to take control."

Jamroz took what she teamed
from Voertman to her company, she
said. “Many of the ways that she
helped me choreograph dances at
Grinnell I was able to use when i
choreographed in New York City,"
Jamroz stated.

McClaurin said that Voertman’s
instruction has stayed with her: "I
can still hear her telling me to sit up
straight," she said. “Beyond just
participating, actually conceptual-
izing a dance was a unique opportu-
nity.“

To McClaurin, the Dance
Troupe was an imponant part of her
Grinnelleducation. "Thereis some-
thing about being able to move be
yond the intellectual dimension of-
fered at Grinnell to a physical ex-
pression, that should be integral to

play; we make musical sounds;
but notjust the sound ofa violin
of the sound of an airplane, but
the voice of the divine. And we
are thankful to people who need
our music. We don’t have time
for a fuller treatment of this sub4
ject, but maybe 20 seconds is
enough: I feel that the most imr
portant thing that can happen in
our life is to [know] the will of
God. Everything we do isjust an
expression of gratitude. There»
fore, we are happy when people
come to hear us because it gives
us a chance to express that grati-
tude. Each concert is an expres
sion of gratitude, an expression
of our love for one another. We
don‘t forget that we are all chil-
dren.

.l S-R: Are these feelings about
your work connected with Chris
tianity? With the Church?

G: We consider the Christian
faith to be, above all, a world
ideal, the principle of human
love. All of our thoughts, of our
deeds, our aspirations are moti-
vated by this.

There are obvious religious
affiliations and national affiliar
tions, but I feel that the ideal of
Christianity, the idea of the love
of Christ does not change. For
me, there is not difference be-
tween faiths, between peoples.
People are either good or bad, of
God or of the devil, and in this
lies the difference between
people. We are glad to come to

America and perform in various
sacred buildings. For us, it is all
the same, because for us there is
no difference between Russians
and Americans, There is more
that is shared than is different.
.1 S-R: Have you ever performed
in a church in Russia?

G: We perform in a building that
used to be a Catholic church. We
feel that as a concert hall it is still
a house ofGod. In the Bible, it is
written “Praise God with strings"
* that is what we are doing.
TZ: How did you become musir
cians?

G: Every person has his own
story. Of course, when a kid
starts to play music. , .we each
have our own story. I started
studying music when I was five
years old. My father was not a
musician, but he had a good mu-
sical ear, and played the
accordian. My mother also had a
good musical ear. I was [not
really] a wunderkind. Well, I
practiced from then until now,
and there you have it.

TZ: Again, thank you for your
time and the interview.

Reasons for Retirement

Voertman said tharshe wanted
to leave the program she created
while it is strong. “I‘m proud ofthe
studenrs‘ work,and it’salways smart
to quit when you're ahead,"
Voertman'said. “I want to quit be-
forel gettired,and before] gettired
of it."

Although she is retiring as
Grinnell's dance instructor, she still
has plans to direct a mainstage thee
atre production in the fall and to
continue acting and directing in the
Grinnell Community Theatre.

Finding a teacher to fill
Voertman'spositionwillnotbeeasy,
according to McClaurin. “You al~
most can't replace the personality.
because that‘s part of what Babe
gave: also, the uniqueness of the
choreography. Not all dancers are
meant to be teachers," she said.

“Whoever comes in to replace
me needs to approach it from his or
her strong points," Voertman said.
“I know they‘ll get strong support
from thedepartment, the faculty and
the student body," she said.
