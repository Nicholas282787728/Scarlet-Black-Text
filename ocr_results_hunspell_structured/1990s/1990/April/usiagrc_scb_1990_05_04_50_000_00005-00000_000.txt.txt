Restructure Peace Day...

To the editor,

We are writing to express our
concern with the events that took
place on this past Peace/Earth day
(April 28th). It has come to otlr
attention that many students were
faced with a choice between
:tltcntling Peace Day events and
participating itt otheructivities. The
thoughtrprovokingissuesraisetlon
PeaecDay werestgniflcantenough
to have merited aeomplete day for
themselves, as was indeed the
intention of those that planned the
day. It is also apparent that at this
timeofyearstudentsareoftenready
to blow off some slcam and have a
day of relaxation and fun. The
iuxtaposition of Peace Day and the
keg races detracted from the
potential beneﬁts and enjoyment of
both. Theseschedulingconﬂictsin
addition to structural lncongruitics
within Peace Day itself prevented
oureainpusfronircaltztngthesptrit
ofhopc and community that Peace
Day should embody.

We believe that one workable
solution might be to reschedule
PeaceDaytoanearlierdate,dtereby
freeing the last weekend in April
[ormorelighthearted pursuits. This
mightbeabettcrclaleforscheduling
a couple big concerts as opposed to

this year's combination ofmuStcal
events and the more serious talks.
workshops, and candlelight Vigil.
These adjustments would, it is
hoped, result in increased campus
unityandparticipadon byproviding
the opportunity for students to
partaketn both events. Tlilssolution
allows the sludcnlbody a period of
tension-release while preserving the

integrity or Petite Day.

Ifyou have anyothersuggcstions
or comments regarding the future
of Peace Day, please contact box

To the cat tor,

I would like to express my tip-
prceiation to the Peace/Earth Day
Committee foragoodiob oforganr
ixtng on Saturday. I attended ch~
erul of the events and fottnd the
talks and discussions thought-pron
voking. .
l have heard some negative
comments about the price of Peace
Day,especiallyIhecostoftltebands.
l agree with the criticisms that the
bands cost too much, and that next
year we should either have less
expensive entenainment or no en-
tertainment on Peace Dayt But
some, I hear, advocate changing
the basic characterof Peace Day or
doing away with it altogether, to
eliminate the contradiction inher-

ent in having flashy, expensive
bands on a ilay for peace. Their
solution to the problem ofthe cost
of Ilic bands is the equivalent of
throwing out the baby with the
bathwater.

In a college that is as politically
conscious as Grintlell, Peace Day
serves an important function in
raising questions and providing a
few answers about things that we
see wrong with our society and our
world. No matter whatone’s politi-
cal persuasion. the talks on Peace
Day were stimulating to thought
and action, Peace Day should stay,
and perhaps next year the choice of
entertaiitmcntshould beconsidered
more carefully.

I am writing this letter in an
attempt to awaken the students of
theGrinncll College community to
the global repercussions or their
actions. Students, l challenge you
to implement these ideologies that
you so readily espouse

campus who would admit that they

Coca-Cola Corporation claimed to
divest, but in reality Il simply
created a loophole through which
it continues to do business With
the apartheid regime. Instead of
completely withdrawing from the
country, ll created a new company
(the National Beverage Service,
Ltd) out of the former manage-
ment of its South African branch,
and moved its factories into neigh
