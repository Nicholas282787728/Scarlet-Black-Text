Writer—director Phil Robinson
had [or years envisioned a screen
adaptation of a book, ms
13;, written by WP. Kinsella. A
novel of dreams, baseball, and the
uanscendentpowerof faith, Robin-
son released his screen adaptation
last summer as Field nfDreams.

Kevin Costner plays an Iowa
{antler devoted to his family and
troubled by the ruei'ul memory of
his father, whose love of baseball
he inherited.

One evening , a voice advises
Costner to build something: “If
you build it. he will come“ The
voice recurs until Costner instinc-
lively builds a baseball diamond
in the middle of his ﬁeld. One year
later, as Costner begins to realize
how his ”dream" diamond isjeop-
ardizing his farm and ﬁnancial se-

curity, a man appears on the ﬁeld.

It is the ghost of“Shoeless" Joe
Jackson, a ball player whose career
was ruined by his alleged panicipa—
tion in the 1919 White Sox scandal.
Eventually a whole team of ghosts
is resurrected to play, Good-hu»
mored and more alive than ever.

chance to do what they love.

Robinson shot F t‘eld of Dreams
at a farm near Dubuque, Iowa dur-
ing the summer of 1988. Local
farmers were disgusted as they
walcht‘d the studios' comﬁeldsﬂour-
ish under Hollywood’s care. while
their own ﬁelds were baking away
under the sun asaresultof that sumv
mer‘s drought.

Field ofDreamr is part of the
Performing Arts film series at Grin-
nell College. It Will have a single
showing on Thursday, April 12th at
9:15 pm. in South Lounge.
