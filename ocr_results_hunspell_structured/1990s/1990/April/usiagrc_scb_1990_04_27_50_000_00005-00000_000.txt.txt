Rape Memories Linger

By Ann Treistman

Heather—Jean Pyle never ex»
pected that her acting coach could
rape hcr, Buttwo years ago, he did.

"I still have nightmares. When
someone is raped, it is something
that they have to live with every
day,” explained Pyle. “It's still
rape, still Ierribleeven when you’re
close to that person."

Rape, aiid especially "date rape"
are terms that students hear often,
but just as frequently ignore, Witll
the incidents on campus that are
publicized, the attack on Mac Field
for instance, the attacker is often
unidentiﬁed. What about acquain-
tance rape? Are women raped by
fellow students on the Grinnell
campus?

Pyle gives an emphatic yes
“People are cluelessastohow many
cases occur on campus 1 know of
live or six that happened just this
year," She feels that the administra-
tion shouldpublish statisticson how
many rapes are reponed each se-
mesterl “Women would be more
likely to report [the incident] if they
didn'tthink they were the firstones
[to be raped on campusl.”

Currently. the policy for survi-
vors of sexual abuse is that they are
swom to secrecy ifthey wish to ﬁle

a written complaintto the Ofﬁce of
Student Affairs. Pyle agrees that
this protects the survivor because
ofthe small size of thc campus, but
[ch3 that survivors should be al-
lowed to talk about the event with
closofriendsl Shcalsocitedagroup
which she belongs to as an outlet
for survivors of sexual abuse.

The group is nin out of the Grin»
neli Mental Health Center. Donna
Dixon, a clinical social worker at
the center, noticed how many Grinr

nellstudems wereinindividual ther-
apy for some form of sexual abuse,
and got them together beginning in
the fall of 1988,

Though Pyle said that she ini»
tially had to pay to attend the there
apy, the group is now open to any»
one who desires to join free of
charge. ”the center does not re-
ceive any outside funding, and
Dixon said that the Mental Health
Center was, "Just sort of doing it
because it had to be done." Dixon
asserts that women have come to
her as a result of aquaintence rape
occuring on Grinnell Campus.

“It’s great to know lhatl can talk

 

N eW‘Law Publtctzes Stats

Wisconsin Governor Tommy G. Thompson recently signed into
effectalaw which requires its state institutions to publicize statistics
about the number or sexual assault, {date rape". itnd sexual harassment
cases on the campuses each year Students at the Univeisityof
Wisconsin wen t to the late legislature after the administration refused

to take action ,

The" students are pleased with the new law, but the administration ‘

to people who understand every
Thursday aflemoon," said Pyle,
Every meeting begins by each per-
son taking two minutes to talk a
little bit about his/her week. More
time is provided lfpeople need it.
Then the group might do some
exercises from the book Learning
to Heal, reading and discussing
chapters on different types of inti-
macy. Most imponanlly, they are
there to offer support to one an-
other.

Pyle has discovered that rape
rally affects its survivors deeply
andforaveryioug timer Shepoints
out that, ”If I'd known the future
implications, I would have fought
more. Rape steals yoursoulaway,"

Flashbacks to the rape are very
common, Pyle commented that a

cident to the police, but spoke with
her school’s headmaster. The act-
ing coach was forbidden to come
back on school grounds. Pyle was
not the only woman who com-
plained about him

“I often wrsh that I had taken
him to courts It would have been so
hard to proveﬁl had no cuts or
bruises," she said Pyle also em-
phasized how importantit was that
no one denied that the incidentwas
rape, “I would have crumbled if
they had."

A rape-especially aquaintcnce
mpe-- may be dismissed as too
difﬁcult to prove in a court of law,
perhaps, but its true implications
are far-reaching and long-lasting.
Pyle expressed concern with the
fact that there isn’t a campus-wide
awareness of what really goes on
behind closed doors

Men‘March Against Rape

By Benjamin Root

“Gentleness is Strength: A
men’s march for a world without
rape“ will be held this Saturday at
the University of Wisconsin at
Madison by Men Stopping Rapel
Four Grinnell Students plan to at-
tend.

“Changing the mentality that
makes ourculturearapeculture"is
the march’s goal, according to
campus conactErikSkinncr. Other
Grinnetl students whoplantobein
attendance are Todd Brown, Scott
England,and Howard Greenwich
All of them are members of
Grinnell‘s Men‘s Alliance for
Change.

These organizations are a posi-
tive outgrowth from the feminist
movement, and an effort to demon-
strate that males want things In
change. Skinner expressed thisidea
by commenting that “men are libr
erated from the stale roles and
women are liberated from being
terrorized."

The state masculine roles and
terrorism women feel come from a

lackof communication Workshops
before the march on Saturday eve-
ning will emphasize better com»
munication and a better under-
standing of dating dynamics in a
rape culture, confront violence.
show the lies in the popular notion
of masculinity, and discuss bars to
male intimacy such as homopho-
bia and competition

The workshops are going to be
mainly participatory to encourage
anactive changein lifestyles, With
increased communication and free

dom from stale roles, men can be
liberated from the detriments of
being sexual aggressorsl This par-
ticipation. along with a focus on
date rape, is an attempt to get rid of
the “she wanted to" mentality on
the part of men, Skinner hopes, be-
cause “the male knows what was
wanted,"

Themarch will beconducted at
the Capitol of Wisconsin Satur-
day night, and hopes to draw men,
women. and children even though
it is called “a men's march."

Zimmerman
Discusses Career

By Daniel Bliss

Jo Ann Zimmerman, lieur
tcnnntgovcmoroflowa, spoke
on Tuesday as part of thc
RoscnflcldProgram’sscriesof
lectures on WomeninPolitics.
She and Marilyn Nelson, sales
director of Equitable of Iowa
lnc., one oflowa‘s largest in
surancc companies, spoke
about the barriers women face
in government and big busir
ness. Both of them have had
the additional hurdle of large
families twelve children be
tween them , and both have
had considerable success in
theircareersIheyemphasized
that logetforward women have
to “play by the rules"7the same
way that men do, whether by merit,
hard work (recognized by selling
oneself to the full), oropportunism.
Hence the title of the talk: “Surviv-
ing the Good Old Boys Network"
Asked abouther start in politics,
Zimmerman replied that she bagan
by writing her legislator to lobby
forbettercommunitymentalhealth
care, which she did upon seeing the
problems faced by a relative, who
had been treated with thorazinc, in
integrating into the community.
When the legislator failed Io an-
swer her questions properly, she
found out who was runningagainst
him and supported the opposing
candidate,helpingou_twith hiscam-
paign.

After completing a Masters
degree in nursing at Iowa State
University in 1975, she became
involved in the lowa caucuses, and
whileservingontthallasCounty
Democratic caucus sheparticipalcd
in the ﬁrst nationally recognized
Iowa caucuses, the year Jimmy
Carter’sspringboardvictoryhelped
him through New Hampshire and
the mt of the primary campaign.
Through her pursuit of the mental
health care issue, Zimmerman was
“drawn into" the precinct chair for
Dallas County, since others were
unwilling to pursue the issue for
her. Shortly after this she was
elected to the Waukee School
Board, on which she served for
three years. But it was reapponion»
merit in 1981 which ﬁnally con-

Joanne Zimmerman

vinced her to run forthe Slate Leg-
islnturc, in what was no longer a
safe Republican seat in Dallas
County.

Zimmerman feels strongly that
her considerable experience in lo-
cal politics and her position on the
County Central Committee of the
Democratic Party served her very
well in her successful campaign.
She hadnwiderangeofcoutacts all
over thedism'ct,and many had seen
her abilities as a politician, a cam-
paigner,andanzldministrator. And
with her interest in health care,
education, and rural development
she had a wide range of support in
both the suburban eastofthc county
(near Des Moincs) and the rural
west. From hcrc she ran success-
fully for re-election in 1984 and

then forlieutenantgovemor in 1986.

So how have women gotten into
politics, and how do they succeed?
Zimmerman cites history. First
there was a phase of womcn run-
ning in place of their husbands.
brothers, or other male relatives.
Secondly, in the 1960’s the femi-
nistmovemcnthclpedgive women
the conﬁdence and the issues on
which to run independently. But,
she argues. it is the third stage, in
which we now are, where wide
opportunities are being opened.
Women have now been in the sys—
tem for some time, with great suc-
cess, and are rising higher in greater
numbers.
