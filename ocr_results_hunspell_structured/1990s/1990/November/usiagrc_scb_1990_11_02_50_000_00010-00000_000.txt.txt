John Waters Recalls
605 TV with Hairspray .

By Brett Fechheimer

Itis Baltimore, circa 1961. The
hippest teenagers are the ones with
wardrobes overflowing with
clothesmatareaqua-blue.chartuese
and hot pink. These same young
people religiously watchanddrwn
of dancing on The Corny Collins
Show, Baltimore's answer to
American Bandslartd. The prob-
lem is thotThe Corny Cullianhow.
although it has no qualms about
playing music by black artists,only
allows white kids to dance on
camera. The neatest TV show in
town, like much of America in the
early ‘60’s, sLill practices segrega-
tion.

Welcome to the wild world of
John Waters' 1988 film Hairspray.
It is a world of obnoxious color
combinations (lime green wrth
ﬂaming purple, for example) and
obnoxious yct ultimately endear-
ing characters (Divine as Mrs.
Tumblad, for instance). Hairspray
is, however, Waters‘ most tasteful,

and commercially acceptable,
movie to date. It doesn’t come
anywhere close to matching the
shock value and ail-out grossness
of his earlier ﬁlms like Pink Fla-
”Lingo: or Female Trouble.

The heroine of Hairspray is
Tracy Tumblad (Ricki Lake), an
outgoing young womanwho finds
herself propelled to local stardom
by her appearances on The Corny
Collins Show. Her nemesis is the
jealous Amber Van Tussle (Cola
teen Fitzpatrick). The plot centers
around the conflict between Am-
her and Tracy, with a subplot con-
ceming Tracy’sdesire to intergrate
The CornyColliruShow. Thestyle
of this film, however, is just as
important,lf not more important,
titan the plot. llairspray': style is
at once campy. deadpan and pro—
foundly exaggerated. The casting
is a jewel: Sonny Bono stars as
Amber’s father, and Pia Zadora
has a bit part as. of all things, a
beatnik.

Hairspray is sheer fun.

Sammy and Rosie Get Laid -

An eruptive settingofsoeizil upheaval and violence in Englandprovides a colorfuibackdrop for humorous
character interaction in Stephen Frear's 1987 f ilm. A Pakistani politician returns to England seeking exile,
only to discover that his English mistress has left him. The movte is further enhanced comically by the
perversesexual politics espoused by his son Sammy and his wifeRosie, who sleepregularly with everyone
but each other. The film features Claire Bloom and Rolarid Gift, ofFine Young Cannibals, in his screen
debut. Frears also directed My Beautiful Laundrelle and Prick Up Your Em (detailing playwright Joe
Orton’s life and death), which are two other highly acclaimed independent films of the '80s

The Chosen --

Vastly different ideologies and lifestyles collide in this film about the tenuous friendship maintained by
twolewish boys in 1940s Brooklyn. Oneofthem isstrictly Orthodox and the other, bmughtup by a liberal
father, finds his friends adherence to tradition strange. However, the two boys begin gradually to respect
and like one another after an antagonistic baseball game at the beginning of the ﬁlm. Maximilian Schell
and Rod Steigcr effectively cnhance the movie as therespsective purveyors of the conflictingZionist and

l-lasidic viewpornts renting Jewish culture at the time.

Guitarist Armstrong t0 Roam Album With
Performs This Week

By John Lopes

At a Greek wedding reception,
people dance circles into the ground
before the night is through. One
such reception took place ata coun-
try club bar. Here excessive drinkr
ing wasn’t the highlight, but rather
an excellent guitarist who was en
tertaining there. He was Steven
Armsu‘ong, a local musician.

Armstrong won the 1985
AmericanFingerstyleGuilarComr
petition and was commended by
Frelrmagazine for his”originality,
expressiveness and technique.”
Among the judges of that year’s
competition were acoustic guitar
legends Leo Kottke and Pierre
Bensusan. In the 1989 competi-
lion, Armstrong’s song “Missing
You“ was selected as the best coma
position.

After receiving his bachelors
degree in music, Armstrong did
graduate work at the Wisconsin

Arrnstrong’scompositions draw
from the classical harmonics of

funky grooves from Ricki Lee

Whether one chooses to attend
closely to Armstrong’s technique
or just sit back and let his music
now, it’s a guaranteed thrill.

Recently, Armstrong and Ruth

Room to Rnam is the title of The
WaterBoys' new album, and the
musical content is as varied as the
title might suggest. An Irish band,
The WaterBoys’ music is mostly
folk music of the Irish variety.

The first song, “In Search of a
Rose," is a traditional Irish ballad
with simple lyrics, a mandolin and
a fiddle. While the first song may
scare off some listeners as being
too “folky,” if they stay for the rest
of the album they will most likely
be hooked.

Immediately following “In
Search ofa Rose” is “Song from the
End of the World," an upbeat tune
with a tone reminiscent of REM.
Yet this comparison is not easy to
make; the WaterBoys keep their
traditional Irish ﬂavor through their
blend of guitar, accordion, mandor
lin, bass and percussion.

“A Man is in Love” comes next
on the album and seems the typical
love song, with simple lyrics and
music, but suddenly surprises the
listener when an Irish jig erupts
from nowhere.

The variety of music that The
WaterBoys perform is partly due to

of the vocal content of the album.
also is the arranger and composer
of most of the songs on the album.

The traditional elementofRoom
Io Roam continues throughout the
album. There are ballads, such as
”The Raggle Taggle Gypsy," Jigs
such as “Kaliope House“ and 0:7
casional instrumental features, as
well as many other styles.

Many other nonAIrish styles are
explored IhroughoutRoom tokoam.
An example of this is“lslandman,”
where the music is focused around
an Australian dijeridu solo. The
song “A Life of Sundays” is en-
forced by a guitar solo and vocal
punctuation by Mike Scott,ending
when The WaterBoys finish the
song withafewlines from “Yellow
Submarine.”

There are a few reasons that
some listeners might be bothered

semblance to American country-
wcstem music. which might be
natural since American country-
westem is derived from folk music

Traditional Irish Inflections

from around the world, Another is
“Something that is Gone,“ which
sounds almost like the music typi-
cal of the “Easy Listening" genre.
but even if you hate the stuff they
play over the speakers at Wal-
Mart, this shouldn’t bother you too
much.

Overall, The WaterBoys have
created an excellent collection of
Irish music in the album Room 10
Roam. U2 is the most popular
band to emerge from Ireland, but
there are others. While fans of
otherlrish groupssuchasSchooner
Faire, Steeleye Span or the Pogues
(forthosemystiﬁedby thesenames,
these bands are primarily Celtic
revival groups playing a range of
material, from traditional songs, to
original music with Irish themes
and styles. to a weird combination
ofpunk and folk relying heavily on
cursing and alcohol) will ﬁnd this
album pleasurable, other listeners
should enjoy it justas well.
