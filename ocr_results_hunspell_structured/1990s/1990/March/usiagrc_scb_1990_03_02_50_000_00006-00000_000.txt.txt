 

Make Responsibility
Accessible in Dorms

Experts estimate that 1 in 300 college students is infected with
the HIV vims, which is currently thought to be partly responsible
for the Acquired Immune Deﬁciency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic
According to these ﬁgures, up to four students on the Grinnell
College campus are likely to be carrying and potentially spreading
this virus.

Grinnell College has suitably recognized the threat by
making a variety of condoms available in the Health Center, the
laundry rooms, as well as the bookstore. Granted, the aim was
to promote responsible and educated decision-making, but we
still must ask - is this enough? Or, are students ﬁnding them-
selves unprepared in situations and taking a chance on their
lives?

The point is. not all sexual activity is planned. Therefore,
it is imperative for Grinnell College to offer students an additional
option so that those who find themselves in unexpected
situations might choose responsiblyr Since the Health Center
and bookstore have limited hours, and the laundry rooms can
seem aLONG way away during a moment of passion, we suggest
that each dorm hall be equipped with a half-dozen condoms
placed “discreetly,“ such as in an envelope, on each ﬂooi’s
bulletin board While we still advocate the indivual’s respon—
sibility of planning ahead (be prepared! it's the Boy Scouts
marching songl), this would provide a 24Ahour excuserproof way
[or studens to choose toprotect themselves.

The plan would, in pan, depend on the maturity of students to
respect the purpose and the need for these condoms to be used in
“emergency" situations. While they may be targets for improper
(and cxpcnsivc) abuse, we feel that the “enlightened" students of
Grinnell College can appreciate this serious matter. After all,
AIDS isn't a vims that makes you itch, it kills.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Columnist Reacts to Insulting Letter

To the editor:

Brian Berger wrote a letter in
the Feb. 23 issue of the Scarlet and
Black, which attacked a column I
had written, and me personally. l-Ie
misunderstood large portions ofniy

Sarcasm "Out
of Control" in
Letters

To the editor:

Sarcasm in the letters to the editor
is out of control. I enjoy sarcasm,
and frequently use it myself, but I
believe that the sarcasm in left
Peirce's letter about 372 and Brian
Berger‘s letteraboutlohn Newmark
is too dominant and that letters like
these, if they were taken at face
value could hurt people.

Peirce‘s comment about the
mentality of the “powers that be"
can only serve to widen the rift
between the\ students and
adminisu-ation and make them less
willing to seekouropinions, While
one sentence of Peirce’s letter
should have been reworded, I don’t
think the Scarlet and Black should
have printed anything but the ﬁrst
paragraphofBerger'sletteriitwas
offensive enough and got its point
across. The last two paragraphs
were inexcusably rude. I would
prefer to believe that the right to
call people names and possibly
injure their dignity is not what
freedom of the press protects.
Walinski’s letter is an example ofa
clearer, more productive form of
communication.

column, misrepresented the ACLU
and Libenarianism, and finally, he
made a snide comment about a
public personage which was grossly
insensitve.

First, he said he was repulsed by
rnysarcastiereterencetothcACLU
as communist. I can understand
why he might be upset. However,
I wasn’t referring to Ccacesw.
Ortega, orTse-Tungr Iwas referring
more to the McCarthy hearings,
where suspectcd “communists"
were labeled “Card»Carrying
membersoflheCommuntstParty.”
George Bush labeled Dukakis ti
“CardrCarrying member of the
ACLU" Bush was clearly trying to
make a connection in the minds of
voters between the ACLU and
communism; the historical
similarities are too obvious to be
ignored. I found humorin the fact
that an attempt to discredit the
ACLU backfired into one of the

fastest increases in membership in
ACLU history, That is why I
sarcastically referred to myseltand
the ACLU as communist, For the
- record,laminfavorol‘Democracy.
While Mr, Berger caught the
sarcasm in the word “communist”
he missed itelsewhere. He thought
I was serious when I said Lhal I
didn’t understand why the ACLU
defended OliverNonh,evcn though
I clearly stated Lhat I understood
their support for the Nazis. One
would think that the Nazis are a lot
worse than Oliver North. Mr,
Berger also thought I was being
serious when I said I was glad to be
backatGrinnell“wherccverybody
is tolerant of everybody else, as
longastheyhavelhepollticallyand
socially correct beliefs.” I meant
the exact opposite, I wish people
here at Grinnell would be more

Newmark's "Drivel" Was
Unfairly, Rudely Attacked

To the editor,

Anyone who knows me knows
that I think John Newmark's col-
umn is "banal drivel." And anyone
who knows me also knows of
my fondness for vicious attacks,
However, Brian Berger’s attack
on John Newmark‘s column
wasbeyondtheboundsofpropriety.

Commenting about ﬂitting
“fromcollegctouniversityandback
againatwill,“andslronglyimplying
that Mr. Newmark ls :‘ﬂ shitrl’on
brains, dildoesque simp," and
calling for retroactive abortion
make the Lhru' i” Mi. Berger's
letter a personal attack, not an

enlightened commentary on the
issues ML Newmark (however
inepdy) raisesr

“We still have a chance to make
this world a better place to live,"
Mr. Berger says. But playing the
bully by attacking John Newmark
isn’tgoing to helpanythingr Ier.
Berger’s interest is truly in
improvingtheworld,heshouldstop
picking on palhclic columnists,and
start offering more coneruCtivc
advice than the retroactive abonion.
Carpe diem, baby, before you look
like as big a hypocrite as Mr.
Newmark.
