Involved with SGA

allJoint Board meetings in order to
ensure that I don't Chair the Joint
Board without first exposing my.
self to a large number of meetings
and thus becoming acquainted with
the many nuances of parliamentary
procedure. In fact, by the time this
semester is over,Iwill have close to
forty Joint Board meetings under
my belt

If elected, Ipromise four things.
First, as Rob Killion did in Decem-
ber, 1 will again create an SGA Toy
Drive Committee (of which Iwas a
pan this year) for MICA, a local
food pantry in town that distributes
toys to many needy Grinnell area
children during the holidays. The
Grinnell Herald Register and
KGRN, the local radio station, both
highly publicize the event. so the
Toy Drive has an added beneﬁt of
improving town/college relations.

Second, Ipromise to continue to
hold open forums. Fonims are an
excellent was to allow interested
studentstovoioe opinionsandcome
to a better understanding ooncem-
ing issues thatare“hot"on campus,
which, in turn, allows the President

Advistxy Committee. One of the
things that came up is, weonly have
an advisory role, that there wasav-
p, that was moved forward. was
promoted to a v.p. from a regular
staff position, and the administra-
tion, although, I think the person
was deﬁnitely qualiﬁed and good
for the position, set a bad prece-
dent, because what happened was
they internally promoted, under the
pretense that there was an emer-
gency problem. At the time, there
wasn’t really an emergency prob-
lem. They said it would happen
effectivelune 1, and this happened
back in November or so. So it's
obviously not an emergency prob-
lem. In that sense, I came out
immediately and said we have to
pay auention to how the admini-
stration is dealing with us, and how
it's paying attention to some of the
things we‘ve put in place, because
that’s a committee with students
active on it, thathas an SGA repre-
sentative, that had obviously set
down mles in the past that were not
really paid total attention to. Also,
the college was stepping on its own
feet, because it had certain rules
that it wanted to keep in place.

As I already said. working out of
the Student Affairs Office. the
things thatI've mne in there. The
programs that we do. I don't know
how I can stress this, because I
certainly work a lot of hours at it.
rwlly try to do things for the entire
community. Those, sometimes,can
be all-campus study-breaks, they'll

to better represent the students.

Third, every other week I will
write a column in the Scarlet and
Black informing the campus about
what is going on with SGA. The
morethat studentsknow about what
SGA is doing, the easier it is for
students to evaluate the perform-
ance of SGA.

Finally, I promise to make the
Ofﬁcial Joint Board Agenda and
Minutes available through the
AVAX. Computerizing the Agenda
and Minutes has the crucial advan-
tage of informing the campus about
issues that are scheduled to appear
at the next Joint Board meetings.
This meansthatsludentscanchoose

it‘sa little misleading, working out
ofthe Multicultural Affairs Ofﬁce
specifically, but we've cenainly
done lots of things there.

What has SGA lacked that you
can provide?

I think there is more dynamism
that SGA can exude. In a sense, it
can appear a lot more dynamic and
just a lot more powerful and all»
encompassing. I think the biggest
thing,rightnow,ishowwe‘rerelat-
ing to the student body. I don't
think there is a large enough con-
tact area, you’d say. People come
to SGA for one reason. I mean,
they come with budgets. They fig-
ure, when do you go to SGA~
when you have to do an ACE pro
gram or something like that I think
that I, by extending myself and
cabinettospeciﬁcorganirationsand
groups that are doing things, like
Students to End Apartheid or the
recyclingorganizations. Whatever
the case may be, we can really help
extend that. I think that’s the pri-
mary thing that‘s been lacking. I
think otherwise, we’re doing good
jobs. There's good communication
to the students. The students do
actually know what’s going on.

live, Ithink. very informative to the
entire campus that was sitting by,
watching an issue go by. And so,I
think that was good. I think we
mostly need to reach out and touch
more of the students here, and one
of the ways we can do that is with
student groups.

Your strongest involvement in
campus aeti 'ties seems to have
been very specialized. As SGA
president, how would you be able
to represent the views and opin-
ions of the entire student body?

I have to qualify that specialim-
tion. As you've already heard. and
through the course of theinterview,
thatspecializedareahasmoremeant
that I’ve taken my energies and,
under one heading, done a whole
lot. That's more what’s happened.
The titles of the ofﬁces do imply
cenain, not “subgroups“ on this
campus, but we have to pay atten‘
Lion, more importantly, as to how
these “subgroups" augment, are an
integral part of, and relate to the
general collegecommunity. We’ve
had students here of different cul-
tures since, I guess, the late 18003,
and it's always been an imponant
aspect. Emerging majority pro—
gram was a program designed to
educate, and it was designed by 10
Calhoun and I helped coordinate
that with her. It was a program
designed to educate our entire
campus. These are, by no means,
strictly targeted and specialized
positions. So, in some sense, I
guess the question is different, just

sonof “What have you donetohelp
ﬂtecarnpus?”m0re_sothan “What‘s
your specializationT".

What speciﬁcally are some of
your personal goals which you
would like to see turned into
“tangible events”

Some of them I’ve already spo-
ken about. But one of the things
that’scomeup aboutaweek-and-a-
half ago, two incidents came up. I
think only one of them was told to
the campus, but two incidents actu~
ally occurred, to friends of mine,
concemingsecurity. Iimmediately
went over to Tom Crady to speak
about it, and to see what they were
indeed doing, and he told me that]
should go to Steven Jones, who had
been working in that committee
and had put up the proposals. I
think those are good steps. I re-
member, when l was a senator, that
was one of the things that was high
on my list, and I think we actually
got Student Affairs to get that
committee together. Butthat‘sone
ofthe thingslwanttoseedealtwith
in the future, and this is where it’s
imponant talking about how I can
helptolake ideas andulrn them into
“tangible events."

It‘s the kind of thing I've been
doing as the chair of the program
committee that works out of the
Multicultural AffairsOfﬁce, When
people say, we've got a concem
about an upcoming anniversary, we

Yeah, well, we all have dreams.
As Vice President I could do noth«

speciﬁcally, to see what people ac-
tually wanted for their senior ban-
quet, instead of just saying, “0h
let's have a ‘nice‘ senior banquet.
lots of things, and good food."
Anyway, I want to work off of that
current proposal, and if it’s not up
to par, and if we’re still in danger,
then we need to go funher with that.

They all stem from the things
that I stated earlier as things that I
wanted done, because I take them
very personally. When I’m com-
mitted to something. as I am, in»
deed, committed to some of the
things I’ve said to you, like, in par-
ticular, town/gown relations. It’s
something thatI really want to see
happen. I mean. these are indeed
my personal goals. In some ways.
that‘s notreallydifferenlfrom some
of the oulerquestions, because they
are indeed personal goals. I think,
very generally, I want to consis-
tently be committed, remain open
to hearing the students and consid-
ering what they want I think this
can be done by moving into the
student groups. by forming aslarge
a contact base, getting a betterrela-
tionshipwith them and lhesttldents,
and just a general interrelationship
with student life. I think that's the
biggest thing we can really expand
SGA.

SGA has a lot of power. SGA
hasalot of potentialforbeinga true
sludent-govemment association,
that doesn’t exclude. that doesn’t
seem distant, that you don’t think
