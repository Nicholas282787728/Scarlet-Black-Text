Washburn Reﬂects on Campus Newspeak

A few cases of questionable
dictionin the Sept. 21 editionofthe
Scarlet and Black provoked me to
reﬂect on the vitiated state of our
mother language.

“Genocide." This term,
etymologically linked to “gene,”
denotes the systematic killing of an
entire race, and not simply “mass
murder.” To refer to Syrian dictator
I-Iafez Assad‘s slaughter of 20,000
of his people as “genocide" is to
place this crime among
incomparably larger ones, and is
irresponsible.

Noris“genocide"anappropriate
designation for the abuses of the
South African government. It is
only consonant with logic that, if
South Africa were destroying its
black population, it would not have
masses of African blacks trying
despelatelytocrossinloitsborders.
While it is unjust. apartheid has
fallen far shortero “genocide“ than
the Marxist African regimes of
Zimbabwe, Angola and Ethiopia.

which have butchered hundreds of
thousands of blacks.

“I-Iomophobic.” 0n the front
page of the Scarlet and Black was
an article beginning “Homophobic
incidents...have raised ooncem..."
The writer is referring to assaults,
both physical and verbal, on
homosexual people. The adjective
“homophobic" suggests that the
incidents are characterized by a
“phobia"of sorts. Bula“phobia" is
a debilitating fear, and it is hard to
see what fear has to do with these
af fronts. If the perpetrators had
phobias. they would become
terriﬁed. like someone suffering
from claustrophobia. They don’t,
of course; their juvenileactions arise
from loathing and/or spite, Nor do
the victims have phobias. So there
is nothing to qualify the incidents
as “phobic." We should dispense
with “homophobic," which has no
meaning save its literal one, "afraid
of the same,“

“Imperialism.“ This phrase is

linked to “empire," which denotes
the conquered lands of an
aggressively expansionist country.
Leftist publications like The
Nation have applied the term
to American involvement in
Vietnam, for instance. But this is
fallacious because, had we won
the Vietnam war and established a
democratic government in Saigon,
there is simply no way that we
would have remained in the South
and annexed it to our territory.
Nor did America have ambitions
to annex Korea, Grenada or
Panama. What sane person would
contend that we wanted to make
these lands part of our republic?
America launched campaigns to
supplant the despotic forces of
the NLF, Kim Il Sung, and
Manuel Noriega. The charge of
“imperialism” is nugatory.
“Anti-choice.” If people with
pro-life sympathies are, as the
PoliticallyActiveFem' stAlliance
has put it, “anti-choice,” then, by

 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Newspaper Staff Unprofessional
in Abridged—Issue Open Letter

To the editor.

I am well aware from long
experience what is involved in
journalism and publishing,
especially where professionalism
is an issue. It is therefore not my
intention in this letter to offend the
editors of the S curlel and Black or
be inconsiderate to their concerns.
I will, however, say that the open
letter to the student body last week
was poorly conceived, sadly
executedandmtherunprofessional.
Certain facts about work in
journalism are unalterable. These
are long hours, hard and stressful
working conditions, and, in many
cases, lack of respect from the
public.

I submit that few of the
complaints expressed in the open
letter are reasonable given diese
facts. The staff complains of poor
equipment, but expensive
equipment does not necessarily
result in excellent work. The
paper, in my opinion, cannot
complain about inadequate fun-
ding,andiam willing to debate the
aridlmetic any time. In addition to
being acquainted with the ﬁscal

situation on my high school

newspaper (which exceeds this
one in quality of content by
miles), I independently edited
and publishm a monthly magazine
for two years, From that expe-
rience, Iknow that I am correct
in saying that the money this
paper receives from SGA plus
advertising revenue is more than
enough for the production of
this newspaper, especially
considering the quality of the final
product.

The staff's complaints of low
salaries are also not valid. During
my time as an independent
publisher and as an editor on my
high school paper, I received no
money at all, yet that did not
interfere with my commitment to
producing a quality product.
Further, when people cornered me
to complain about an article, I did
not respond by wasting my
publication‘s resources (we were
entirely independently funded by
advertising) or my readers' time
by whining in print The general
public is not an entity from which
one can usually expect common
sense much less unqualified

Anti-Homophobia Group

To the editor,

The Grinnell Lesbian and Gay
Alliance has changed.

In the past, we were not as
accepting ofallies and bisexuals in
our communily as We should have
been. GLGA was the only

organization for lesbian. gay and
bisexual concerns, and as a result,
was oftenconcemcd with personal,
rather than political issues. But we
are working to change this. which
is why our name is changing to
reflect it.

support. But do not blame readers
too much. A paper can earn
disrespect by not doing the entire
job.

The evidence is laid out every
week: missed coverage, shallow
research, incomplete reporting
and lazy writing Taste is put at
risk almost weekly by publishing
letters that are nothing more than
ad hominem attacks on people on
campus. Instead of summarizing
"all of the news stories.” which
the staff apparently felt numbered
three last week, they should have
asked therelevantpeoplequestions
about those issues and brought to
the readers the complete story.
This paper fails to do that even in
a normal issue. Where is the
information? Where isthe attention
to the sources? Iwas home ill last
week, and a campus alcohol riot
took place in my home town
while I was there. Photographers
and reporters were at the scene
conducting interviews and
gathering information. Attention
to the sources. Getting the whole
story. Where is the Scarlet and

”Patriarchy." Given that there
are more females registered as
voters than males, it is hard to
attribute to sexism the
dispropomonate number of men in
our government. Sexism could
hardly prevent the ascendence of
qualifiedwomenintohighpositions
in Washingtion. A term meaning
“govemmentby men.” “patriarchy"
has a somewhat obscure relevance
to our society today.

Incredibly. if people advocate
and work towards socialist reform,
which the world in general has
begun to cast off, they are
“progressive" (figure thatout). If,
on the other hand, someone don‘t
advance this type of reform and
doesn’t support leftist causes, he or
she is guilty of “apathy."

It is not the finest hour for
English language purists, or for
those who feel that political
lexicon should be divorced from
common speechr Using the word
“imperialism" in discussing a
foreign policy issue already
establishes the speaker’s position
regarding theissue. Justemploying
the phrase precludes neutrality.
But this loaded phrase—and
other bits of Orwellian Jargon
like “eurocentrisn‘l” and
“pau'iarchy”4havefoundtheirway
into common speaking and are
enjoying a sort of vogue. They
educe hostility towards the things
theyare used to describe. Whoever
came up with “eurocentrism”
obviously thought thateurocentnsm
was doubleplus ungood.

Point of Black Pride

To the editor,

Mike Washburn’s Sept. 21
editorial isaclearexampleofalack
of understanding of black issues.
His distortion of the concept of
black pride is an example of the
“genuine ignorance, stupidity and
racial intolerance" of which he
accused black leadership.

I am insulted and disgusted that
he picked three men to represent a
“host"ofcivilrightsleaders. Stating
thatJesseJackson, Louis Fanakhan
and Kwame Toure represent all
black Americans is equivalent to
saying that Dan Quayle, David
Duke and Tom Medscar represent
all white Americans.

Washbum has also misinter-
preted the role of the media by
taking a simplistic approach and
choosing poor examples. The
incident involving CBS and Andy
Rooney resultedinademonstration

Explains Name Change

Homophobia (GCEH) is a solely
political organization, dedicated to
working for gay, lesbian and
bisexual rights. We believe that in
order to be a true community, we
must open up lo all of Grinnell and
accept the aid of anyone who
opposes homophobia. It is only

that we may begin to fight
homophobiaon campus. Therefore,
we felt our name had to change and
include all members of our
community. Homophobia. to say

Finally,Washbumstates“White
liberals have made large strides in
exposing and defeating white
ractsm." Black people don't. have
have the power to commit racism.
therefore, it is fitting that white
liberals are attempting to deal With
this problem. It should also be
noted that black Americans have
alwaysbeenleadetsandparticlpants
in our struggle to end the racism
and oppression that affects our total
existence in this society. We, as a
people, are creating aculture that is
positive and reﬂects ourimage. That
includes black activism, black
power and statements that reﬂect
black pride and empowerment.
Washbum’s interpretation of these
expressions clearly reﬂects a lack
of knowledge. What I‘m trying to
say is: “It's a Black Thing—You
Wouldn’t Understand".

Speaker's
Comments
Inappropriate

‘I was very offended by Dr.
Dorsey‘ssennoninHerrickChapel,
Sunday, Oct. 7. While he had
several good points, I felt that his
statement that “Adam and Steve”
relationships were not a “viable
option" for black students was
uncalled for. Such a homophobic
remark is offensive anywhere, but
is particulary inappropriate on this
campus.
