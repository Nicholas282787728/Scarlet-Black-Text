“Kaslalsky did not write a vigil

Russian Orthodox Church, like a
mass),” StuhrrRommereim continr
ed. “He wrote individual move-
ments throughout his life. This
piece wasn’t designed as a unit;
we're picking pieces from over the
course of his career, so you could

lection and it will be an enjoyable
experience,"

Again, Stuhr-Rommereim has
no doubt that the Chorus and Sing
erswill beable to perform the piece.

“I am confident that the chorus
can do a very goodjob because they
did quite well on Raehrnaninol'rs
Liturgy two years ago, which is
similar in style,” said Stuhr-
Rommereirnr “The main challenge
is to get people to pronounce the
text. It's aboutan hourofspeaking
church slovaniC: it‘s unfamiliar.“

Stuhr-Rommereim is planning
Seveml events to coincide with the
recording.

“We plan to bring in an immi-
nent scholar on Russian choral
muSlc, Peter Yemlikhod, who is a
world class conductor of Russian
descent. He wouldbc workingwith
the choir and fine tuning their dic-
tion and interpretation. We also
hope to have a lecture coordinated
with this performance by Vladimir
Morosan on Russian choral mu-
sic.“

“It‘s really exciting to be doing
a recording. but also a little nerve.

- to make it permanent," said Stuhr-

Rommereimr “But we will have a
nice item to sum up the choral pro-
gram forvisitors and prospectives.“
