Students
Join with
Unified
Sports

By Susan Thomas

When the Iowa Special
Olympics approached the
Community Service Center
requesting Grinncll's cfforLs a" a
voluntec' school for the ncv
Unified Sports program, they
didn’t realize that they were
making a request’that would be
so strongly supported. ’

The Unified Sports
volleyball program at Grinncll
is composed of equal numbers
of mentally retarded and non-
mentally retarded players. These
players meet every Sunday
aflemoon for six weeks to play
volleyball on their designated
teams.

Each player stays on the
same team throughout the enitre
program in hopes of developing
lasting friendships with their
teammates. This theory is
inspired by the Special
Olympics philosophy of
bringing “all persons with
mental retardation into the larger
society where they are accepted
and respect

The Olympians come from
the CIRSI Group Home, which,
in conjunction with the Jasper
County Core Facility and the
Powesheik Career Development
Center, has given the program a
strong start. Currently there are
around 25 student volunteers.

Community Service Center
Commended volleyball coach
Sheila Cain as well as members
of the volleyball team for their
efforts and support 1

The program receives
financial support from the
Kiwanis Club, which donated t-
shirts to each participant and is
sponsoring a party at the end of
the program, With the
dedication of groups such as
this, the program has been able
to fulfill the Uniﬁed Sports goal
of “helping athletes with mental
retardation develop sports skills.
demonstrate courage, experience
joy and participate in a sharing
of gifts, skills, and friendships
with their families, other
Special Olympics athletes, and
the community."

When asked about the
program, Heather Torrcnce, who
has been a volunteer since the
beginning. commented, “It is a
good program because it puts

students with the Special
Olympics athletes in an
unsupervised atmosphere. It
isn‘t competitive. It's unified
because there really isn't
teaching and learning going on;
friendships are developing.”

Volleyball '

Men Place 3rd at Drake

By Eben Erhard

Riding an emotional high,
the Grinncll Experience men's
volleyball club storlned to a
third place finish in the Drake
Bulldog Invitational last
weekend. ' The highly
competitive field of 10 teams
made this quite an
accomplishment for the
Experience.

It all began Friday night on
Haines first with Dave Clark
and his clippers. Ten hours
later the team marched into
Drake University’s Bell Center
with considerably less hair,
ready to begin their conquest.

Grinncll started off quickly
beating Maharishi International
University 15-13. 15-12 in
eome-from-behind games.
Winning this ﬁrst match was an

ltlllll's

important step, as the
Experience had never won their
first games before. ’

The winning continued with
victories over Onitt, a team
from a military base in
Nebraska. Then the Experience
lost two hard fought games
against a tough UNI team 14~
16, and 16717. The team
finished the day by splitting-

The bouncing ball has not been
kind to the men's basketball
program this past week: it just
seemed to roll off the rim. Or.
in the case of the Illinois
College game, rocket off the
rim and smack the Pioneers

‘right in the middle of their

collective forehead. ,

If there was any poetic
justice Friday night at Illinois
College should have been the
13Ih. Grinnell plnycd as though
the team van had run over every
black cat from Grinnell to
Jacksonville. In the immortal
words of former assistant Kyle
Foumcy, the team played like
they had “ashtray hands” (don’t
even ask!), commiting I9
turnovers while shooting just
34%.

In a game that junior
swingman Dave Chamberlain
described as ”a nightmare“, the
Pioneers got off to a shaky start
and found themselves down 60-
21 at the half. Chamberlain
diagnosed the 95—49 loss as a
case of “a slow start and slow
finish...slow middle too." Chris

Jacobsen was the only Pioneer
in double ﬁgures with I0 points
and Scott Whipple continued his
rugged insidc play with 10
rebounds.

But what a difference a day
makes. Saturday at Knox
College the Pioneers stuck to
their game plan and.played the
Knox tealn down to the wire
before losing 6054. Chris
Jacobson, however, had an
outstanding day, grabbing 13
boards and leading Grinncll with
18 points. Mike Spurbeck
bombed away for 16 points, and
the point guard tandem of
Holland Neal and Wendell
Barber combined for 10 points,
nine boards and seven assists.
Neal added four steals to cap off ,
his best all~round outing of the
season.

Tuesday night the Pioneers
crossed the Mississippi (which
might be renamed the River
Styx at this point) one last time
to race Monmouth College. As
Shaan Hamilton described the
game, the Monmouth tandem of
Lavcry and Mitchell simply
overpowered the Grinnellian

Grinnell‘s lead was slashed to 37-
31, as Coe had launched a 1272
string. The teams traded baskets,
and the score stood at 45437 with
only 7:50 left in the game. The
Kollawks quickly cut the lead to 47»
43, with less than six minutes
remaining. ’
After that, it was takeover Little.
