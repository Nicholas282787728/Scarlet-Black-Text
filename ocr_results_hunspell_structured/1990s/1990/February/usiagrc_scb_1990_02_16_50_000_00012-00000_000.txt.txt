Coming off an impressive
84—57 victory over Monmouth
the Grinnell Women‘s basketball
team was set for a showdown
with the conference»leading
Knox Siwash. Darby's nearr
capacity crowd waited anxiously
for the start of the game.

Grinnell started off quickly,
jumping to an 8-1 lead. From
this point forward, the Pioneers
never looked back. They went
on to lwd 38721 at halftime and
continued to push hard in the
2nd half to a 5745 victory,

The win guaranteed the
Pioneers a place in the
conference loumamcnt, with a
7-2 league record. Last year was
the team‘s ﬁrst winning season
since the sport's inception at
Grinnell.

Knox made many attempts
to cut into the Grinnell lead,

only to be stymied with a big
play by any number of Grinnell
players.

Grinneii's scoring was led
by Laura VanSickle and Missy
Sharer with 24 and 19 points
respectively. The Pioneers were
also sparked by a solid game by
Amy Fort and good play off the
bench by Leigh Ashley, Julie
Kasler, and Jenny Wood.

Coach Ted Eskildsen said he
was "really pleased with the way
the team executed." He added
that the team had worked on a
new pressrbrcak and altered its
defense specifically for this
game. The defense worked
perfectly, as the Pioneers held
Knox to 31—perccnt shooting for
the game. Eskildsen especially
complemented Sucllen
Hageman's play on defense.

The Pioneers also outre-
bounded Knox. grabbing 31
rebounds to the Siwash's 20,

. Grinnell still has to beat
Illinois College, one of the two
conference teams that has beaten
them this season, this Saturday
in order to win the South
division title.

“Although Knox may have
appeared to have been the more
important game in terms of
conference standings," said Julie
Kastcr, "Illinois College will be
an even more emotional game,
because they beat us twice last
year and came back to beat us
this year in their home court."

After playing Illinois
College, the Pioneers face
Carleton College on Sunday,
and end the regular season
against Clarke College on
Tuesday.

According to Eskildsen, "The

Three school records were
shattered last Saturday at the
Southern Division meet at
Cornell. IoAnne Sackett was
responsible for two of them,
running the 600 M in 1:43 and
1000 M in 3:16. The third was
by Jonathan Lave, who blasted a
time of 3:59 in the 1500 M,
nearly three seconds off the
school record. Such awesome
performances only set the tone
for a very fine all~round effort.

It has been a long time in
Grinnell track history since a
team has scored more than 100
points in a meet, The superb
effort landed the men‘s team in
3rd place, only six points
behind the 108 points of C06,
Despite Sackctt’s performances,
and because to a number of
injuries. the women‘s team
placed ﬁfth, only 14 points out
of third.

Being a small cohesive
team, many of the women are
capable of doing well in more
than one event. Kate Peterson
demonstrated this maxim as she
flew to a 4th place finish in the
55 M dash and also ran a leg of
the 4 X 200M relay. In the
distance events, Michelle Borg
and Michelle Thompson
maintained a steady pace in the
800M and 3000M respectively,

Also competing for Grinnell
were Abby Green, Carol
Peterson. and Iva Chang in the
High Jump, all of whom placed,
Andrea Shaffer and Jennifer
Jones in the 4 X 200M. with

his day with a very fast anchor

he ran an impressive 800M to

By Holly Kellar

The Grinnell women‘s
swimming and diving team had
a “fantastic" weekend. according
to Coach Shcila Cain, despite
Grinncll‘s defeat in the dual

victory in the Small College
State Championships against
Bucna Vista, Coe, Cornell,
Loras and Luther colleges. The
Pioneers scored a total of 455.5
points. 118 points more than
2nd place Luther.

“It was a total team effort,”
Said Cain. “A majority of the
team swam their fastest times
all year. We’re right where we
need to be two weeks out of the
Conference meet."

The weekend produced 18
season’s best and six lifetime
best times for the Grinnell
women. Saturday‘s first place
finishes included Alyson
Jepson, 1000 freestyle
(12:16.69), Amy Oggel. 200

In the days until the

the team will be “resting and
working on details.”
