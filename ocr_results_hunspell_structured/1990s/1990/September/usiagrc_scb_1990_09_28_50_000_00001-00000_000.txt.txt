Student Government Combats Apathy

Apathy
Debated
in Open
Forum

By Sharyn Obsatz

What began as an SGA open
forum on the issue of apathy devela
oped Monday night into a debate
about whether student govemment
should take a stand on political
issues.

The forum, attended by 70 stu-
dents. opened with the SGA cabi-
net, led by PresidentPedro Feman~
dez-McCarthy,expressingconcem
over the lack of student interest in
campus issues such as the new al-
cohol and parking policies. Fer-
nandez-McCarthy pointed out that,
although the general student con-
sensus has been against the new
parking policy, only 30 students
attended the recent SGA open to
mm on it. This low turnout gavethe
trustees the impression that the
current policy was not a contested

issue on campus and in fact carried
general student support,

that none of the issues that SGA
dealt with were of interest to her,

Some students attending the fo-
rum also questioned the effective-
ness of SGA in inﬂuencing campus
policy, They pointed to previous
instances of policies, such as off
campus housing, in which SGA was
unable to effect change. Andrew
Sheehy disagreed, stating that
through the SGA initiative process.
students were able to change a pol-

“Students need to be aware that we
do have power....Apathy only tie

often the administmtion and the
trustees do come to him asking for
student opinion on speciﬁc poli»

The debate then turned to the
question of the legitimacy of the
expectation that SGA should rep-
resent the opinion of all the stu-

Grinnell College Excellence
Highlighted In The Iowan

Grinnell College, which is be-
ginning it‘s 145th year, is the focus
of an ll-page feature article in the
Fall issue of the Iowan magazine
scheduled for distribution this week.

The Iowan article highlights
Grinnell’s rich history of academic
excellence, public service, cultural
diversity, internationalism, and
open inquiry through interviews
with key administrators, faculty,
and trustees.

”Teaching at Grinnell is a mag-
nificent experience,” says Kesho

Scott, assistant professor of Ameri-
can studies and sociology. She calls
the college “a microcosm of the
country‘s greatest ideas.“ a place
for those who wish to engage in in-
tellectual, social, political and cul-
tural activities with a degree of sup-
port and encouragement.
President George Drake, who
will retire next year after complete
ing 12 years as Grinnell's chief
executive, says it is the “college's
job" to challenge trends, fashion-
able politics and prevailing social

thought. “Any college that is open
to ideas will be threatening to socir
ety at large,” Drake says.

The Iowan profiles “A Galaxy
of Grinnellians,” a partial list of
distinguished alumnipast and pres-
ent including film stars Gary Coo-
per and Peter Coyote, authors Ruth
Suckow and James Norman Hall,
poet Amy Clampitt, Academy

poser Herbie Hancock, Nobel

interest in student government. SGA
members led an Open Forum on
apathy Monday night.

”SGA loses its power when stu-
dents don‘t participate," declared
SGA President Pedro Femandezr
McCarthy.

According to Fernandez-Me»
Carthy, many students complained
aboutthestudentgovemment’srole
last year, yetactually did little to try
to inﬂuence SGA. The new cam»
paign against apathy is an attempt
to bring the students and SGA closer
together, said Fernandez-MC»
Carthy.

Among the activities which
Femandez-McCarthy cited as nec-
essary to combat apathy among the
student body are voter turnout,
correspondence with dorm senar
tors and contacting SGA to voice
pressing concems.

Thestudentgovcmmenthasalso
implemented new policies to in-
crease correspondence between
SGA and the student body. The
new position of studentrgroup li-
ason is one such measure. This
position exists to aid the communi-
cation among student groups on
campus.

In response to Monday night‘s
Open Forum on Apathy, President
George Drake made it clear that
SGA is a political body, SGA has
other functions. primarily those
involved in administering funds.

“I see SGA as a formal channel
of communications between repre-
sentatives of the student body and
the administration," said Drake.
“When I think about the role that
Student Government played when
l was a Sludan..Thal’s the biggest
differencc...lt was a means of
communication between students
and the administration, but it had
almost no money,”

One of the major questions
addressed at the Open Forum was
whether SGA can fairly represent
the entire Grinnell campus. One
student claimed that Drake, as the
final decision maker, would be less
likelytosupportan SGArsupporled
view if there was a clear difference
of opinion among the studentbody.

“There is always division of
opinion," disagreed Drake. “That
is the way a democracy
works. ..Anybody who understands
the way human nature or a democr
racy works knows that there are
other opinions."

Police Explain Reasons
Behind Increased
Visibility of Officers

By Craig Wacker

The recent increase of police
presence on campus has eased the
tensions of some students, while
causing others anxiety.

According to Assistant Police
ChiefDarrelL’tmehepolice force
wantstomake their presenceknown
on campus.

“We wantlobeseen,"said Lamb.
He stated that though the police
presence is no more than normal in
terms of numbers, officers are en-
couraged to do more foot and bike
patrols. The increased police visi»
bility is enabled by the addition of
several new officers to the Grinnell
Police Department. Although this
number is still below the departr
ment’s normal staff of 14 ofﬁcers,
this is more than it has had in the
recent past. The department cur-

rently employs only 13 ofﬁcers,
because of the migration of several
officers in the recent past.

Lamb said that this new type of
police patrolling is due to an in
creased concern for the safety of
college students.

Dean of Student Affairs Tom
Crady said that the college neither
discourages nor encourages the
presence of the police. According
to Crady. safety of the students is
the number one concem of both the
police and student affairs.

“We want them to be able to
walk across campus wtthout any-
body bothering them," said Lamb.
Lamb cued a particular group
known to create trouble as the rea-
son for recent police presence dur-
ing the weekends. Lamb also said
