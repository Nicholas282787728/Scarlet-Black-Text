rally was not enough and came too
late, M the team )uSl couldn't get
enough runs in thelast two innings
to pull off the victory The final
score was 13-7. Coach Greg Wal—
lace commended relief pitcher Mark
Lehman forhis efforts in thegame,
"He came in relief and pitched the
best he has all year.“

The doubleheader was con-
cluded with Grinnell‘s first victlry
of the season. After a game that
was close the whole way, the Pier
neer's clinched the victory 8—7 in
the eighth innins with a Ben Wal-
lace home run.

Throughout the game, the Pto-
neers held leads of4»1 and 7-3, but
Coe tallied in the bottom of the
seventh to tie the game at seven
apiece. In their tying effort, Coe
gained the momentum, but accord-
ing to Coach Wallace, "It was one
of those games we knew we had to
Win" Ben Wallace had that same
feeling, and put the game away in
the bottom of the eighth with the
game winning, over the track home
run.

In the Knox game, the Pioneers

were flat from the start. Pitching

throughout the game. Ben Wallace
again provided the highlight of the
game with a two-run hornet.
