pus is a mayor cause this

year for the Committee on Stu-

According to junior Dave

members chose to focus on alcoe
hol awareness because they felt
alcohol was one of Grinnell's
most widely abused drugs. The
committee does not wish to cone
vey thatdrinking is bad.Collman
said. but instead wants to raise
student awareness about the ef-
fects of alcohol.

“Everyone may think they
know everything about alcohol."
Collmansaid.“You need toknow
yourself and your limits."

In the efforl's kick-off. the

Committee on StudentHealth dis
tributed literature across campus
and sponsored an alcohol aware
ness presentation Feb. 1 by Mary
Peterson, associate director of
Campus Programs and Student
Activities at the University of
Iowa. The committee also ap-
proached Grinnell Associatc
Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer
Krolin, who said she would offer
a health risk reduction program

been offered at Grinnell in the
past.

Grinnell city ordinance prohibits
outdoor consumption of alcohol.
Therefore. drinking must be cone

Walker noted that the years
1970 and 1974 stand out as par
ticularly difficult years in his
memory. In 1970. American
forces unloaded bombs onto
Cambodia and violence erupted
at KentStaic in Ohio. Along with
two students, Dean Joe Wall, and
President Glenn Leggett. Walker
collected money t fly to Wash
ington in hopes of “deing some-
thing" about violence breaking
out all over the country in re
sponse to the American attack on
Cambodia.

“Grinnellwas the firstschool

“Wesaw thebuses rollingin from
Middlebury and soon as we left."

Walker and thc Grinncll en-
semble spoke \vith Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger. Nixon’s
press secretary. and other Nixon
officials Walker's entourage had
to leave Washington though, as
things back at the Grinnell cam-
pus were “getting out of hand."

They returned |o find that stu-
dents had barricaded the library.
where administrative ofﬁces were
located. Walker then made what he
called the “most difficult" decision
of his career. After returning to

Grtnitell. Walker. Leagctl and other
college officialsdeeidcd toclose the
college. The closing took place in a
feverish five days.

Walker recalled another dife
ficull time in 1974 when Build-
ings and Grounds employees
went on strike, Walker himself,
along with other administrators,
made the minds front building [0
building cleaning toilets. locke
ing doors and scrubbing blacke
boards. The 11~week strike was
another difficult time in his ca~
reer, Walker said.

Walker cited growth of the col-
lcgcendowmentasamnjcrimprove
ment over the years, When Walker
came to Grinnell. the endowment
was Worth $10 million; it now tops
$400 million. This growth, Walker
said. has been due to a combination
of consistently cautious and profit—
ableinvestmcniscngincered mainly
by Joseph Rosenficld and Warren
Buffett, both members of the Board
of Trustees.

Followmg retirement. Walker
plans to travel. In the longeterm.
though, he said he plans to stay in
Grinncll because it IS, and always
