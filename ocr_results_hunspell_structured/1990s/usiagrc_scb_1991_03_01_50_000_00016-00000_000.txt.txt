Grinnell Art Salon winners announced

By K C Leonard

The Grinnell Salon opened
Monday in the Schacftcr Fine Arts
Gallery.Thisexhibition,organized
bytheArtSEPC.isanannualjuned
show open to all Grinnell College
students. This year’s Jul’Oi’ was
Peggy Patrick, former Assistant
Director of the Des Moines Art
Center. From over 100 entries,
Patrick narrowed the exhibition
down to the final 30 pieces.

The show spans a variety of
media including printmaking,
painting. drawtng. watercolor, cer
ramics, sculpture, and mixed me
dia pieces. The diversity of media
is paralleled by the diversity of the
Subject matter in the pieces, al-
though there is a minority of none
objective and abstract work in the
show. Patrick was impressed with
the variety of works entered and
remarked specifically on the
strength of the printmaking pro
gram at Grtnnell.

Time’s Up - Living Colour
Ltvtng Colour incorporates different styles into their music so
well that it sectns effortless. While Time's Up has fewer catchy
melodies than their firstzilbum. itwtll keep yottrattcnticn and begin
to grow on you after a few listens. Living Colour continues to do
more than its share of keeping mainstream heavy metal out of a rut.

Sound ofConfusion - Spacemen 3

Misleadingly, Spacemcn 3 is actually it group of four people
from London, although thcy may well have added the forth person
after they became successful. They Sound like Sonic Youth with
English accents, and, even though their songs are generally less
noisy and more structured, many of them contain periods ol'long,
drawn out feedback. One song, “Little Doll,” is a Stooges cover,
and another. “0D. Catastrophe," is a Stooges riprol'f. I guess they
did that to even things out.

Despite the lame title, the album provides a relatively bann-
less listen overall, and some ofthc songsare effective. Nonetheless,
I think Spacemen 3 probably has done better work.

Same Disenchanted Evening - The Verlaines
This is the {ounh album by the Verlaines. a New Zealand trio led
by the talented Graeme Down“. Like the three previous albums,
Some Dis/enchanted Evening is distinguished by Downes’s classi-
cally inspired song-writing and instrumentation. This album, how-
ever, lacks the restraint of the previous three, and at times sounds
like a collection of (gasp) showriunesl

Overall, though. this disc is a Continuation of the Verlaincs
ttadition of excellence: catchy melodies. original song structures,
and a little classical/punk friction to spice things up. Why a major
label hasn’tpicked them upyetisamysterytome- Igucss theydon‘t
ﬁt into some marketable trend. Maybe if they added a beatbox and

dressed like ﬂower Children they‘d be more promotable.

As has been pointed out. tonight
at 9:00 will be the third time in two
years that this rock/punk/l‘unk trio
has played at Grinnellr They‘ve be-
come, well, an institution. Hey. I
can still remember the ﬁrst time I
saw them a little more than a year
ago in Gardner. Singer/guitarist
Dave Dreibler was speakin’ to me
through his barrage of tasty power
t-ittsandhciplessly confusedlyrics.
while Dave Berg (the other Dave)
kept the casual, mid-tempo rhythm
rolling along. with Barb creating a
bass tine so funky it would make
the Purple Majesty want to start
thinking about contracts.

Anyway. had we carpet (or an»

House might be tempted to. well.
considcrnotplaying here ever again
(this, to some poor unbelievers, is a
