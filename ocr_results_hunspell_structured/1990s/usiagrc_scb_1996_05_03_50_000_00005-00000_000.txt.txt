After college, Dotr decided to

began to make the rounds selling his
services as a percussionist. Dorr ex—
plained that free—lance work is stren—
uous because the free—lance petcus»

Tne semester is winding down,
and the campus is increasinglywotked
up with the ever looming seminar
papers and exams that have the pow—
er to turn the most composed Grin—
nell student into a raving mess. I
have become tired of my pattern of
eat,sleep,and sit on the third ﬂoorot’
Burlingtorsix hours (OK,soI maybe
exaggerating). so I headed over to
KDIC to look around. The people
who I have talked to about their
radio shows this semester have men—
tioned that there are some Interest»
ing items in the KDIC music collec»
tron. When I walked into the studio
I was overwhelmed by the amount of
music triers. I ivas not exactly sure
when it ivas error I was looking tor
among tlie slielves or records and
CDs. The clock ivas screaming tor
me to return to a Macintosh some»
where, so here are some of my obserr
vations.

wrien l was in second grade
i loved Rick Springfield i even

mite Magi. e banging on my
wall. You remember “Jessie's
Gltl" or ii-liatevei it ivas, don'i
you7 And bis ivondertiil pei.
tormaiiees on General Hosplr
[a]? Anyway tor all or you who
admired Rick springtield's
singing abilities in the early
19805 KDlC is your place, 1
iiias looking tlirougn some or.
bums when l struck gold. Tbere
were at least live or six Rick
Springﬁeld albums an die shelves

Many of triem appear to be his work
from the late 1980: that the tecord
companies were probably desperate
to give away, but hey its Rick. and
KDIC does have some of his good
stuff.

There are quite a few
singles that have been sent out
by record companies in an ef»
fort to advertise their artists'
work. I don’t claim to be an
expert in the diversity of mu—
sic, but I don’t think that I had
heard of many of these artists.
What I did note was an early
Tina Turner album (after she
left Ike), the “Dutch Rock:
Alive and Well” CD Complla»
tion, and many solo albums by
artists previously with (name
a band). I would love to take
many of the classical albums
in the collection and play them
on a turntable somewhere. I
suppose that I should not let my
personal interests dominate a
look at KDIC, but here it goes.
There are several Suicidal
Tendencies CDs in the KDIC
collection, tliey are an inter.
esting band. I have not had a
chance to hear as much of their-r
as I would like, You can never
go wrong ii-itb Diana Ross Red Hot,
and my personal favorite is lan Mc<
Ctllloch tliougb in b is post—Echo and
tire Bunnymen days. Basically, ii-iiat
I am getting at is that I cannot dothe
KDlCcollectron notice in a column
in the S and B. Depending on your
musical tastes. you may find it lack—
ing some types or music, bur it is
interesting to look at the collection.
