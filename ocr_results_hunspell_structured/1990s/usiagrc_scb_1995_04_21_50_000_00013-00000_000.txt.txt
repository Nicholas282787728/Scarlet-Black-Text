Coach Eben Erhard. “We expect
about twenty teams which will make
it tlte largest, size-wise, of any meet
we’ll have this year, including coiir
tierettce, and it deﬁnitely will have
higher quality competition than the
conference meet."

“Our men should place in the top
halfbut its really hard to say fora big
meet like this. A few really good
athletesean makeabigdifferencefor
a team," Erhard said.

Key events for the men will in-
clude the Open 300 and the Open
1500 meter. Coach Erhard looks to
athletes such as sophomore Josh
Ward, who ﬁnished in sixth place in
lastweek'sCentrallnvitationalinlhe
1500, as well as first-yeasr Jon

Grccnbcrg arid Kevin Notheis and
sophomores Bryan Rebar, and Ellis
Baggs to do well. Other strong
competitors include senior Anthony
Perez and sophomores JeffRoot and
Thad Lesiak.

For the men, Coe College, Ner
brnska Wesleyan and Monmouth
College are the top three competitors
attending the meet. Coe College also
attended the Central Invitational in
Pella, Iowa last week and ﬁnished
fourth,coming in aheadofGrinnell's
sixth place ﬁnish, and their men are
favored to take second in Confer-
ence. The Grinncll women ﬁnished
ﬁfth in lastweek’smeet,rightbehind
Coe, and the Cut: women are favored
to win Conference,

“We didn’trun as well as we will
later in the season but I think we’re
starting in the rightdirection,” Erhard
szlid of the Central meet’s results.

Erhrad expects the women to
place in the top halfofthe ﬁeld, with
strong showings in the 800 meterand
the 1500meter. Potential contributers
include ﬁrstryears Laura Gould,
Amanda Walker, and Becca Webel,
as well its sophomores Steph Walters,
and Susana Peinado, he said.

“Our focus is always long term
towards the Conference and it really
looks like our men should probably
place in the top three. Winning is not
out of reach but the odds are deﬁr
nitely against us. But its pretty early
still," said Erhard.
