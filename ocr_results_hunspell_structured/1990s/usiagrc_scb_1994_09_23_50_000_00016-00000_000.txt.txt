meet that Grinncll men's coach Will
Freeman called “the biggest meet of
the year until regionals.” Grinncll
hosts the meet each year, and, ac-
cording to women’s coach Evelyn
Freeman, “The day was perfect, the
course was perfect, the officials all
did their jobs well and it could not
have gone any better."

Men’s soccer earns split at_Luther

Sports Information

THE Grinncll men’s soccer
team took third place in the
Mello Classic at Luther last
weekend. In the opening game the
Pioneers lost to their hosts, 170, and
in the consolation game they defeated
Siena Heights, 3-0. Grinncll will
host Cornell in their home opener
today.

Against a Luther squad that had
already played six games. the Pio-
neers were defeated as a result of
their overraggrcssivc defensive
scheme. “We played the wrong lac-
tics, and I blame myself," said coach
John Pfitsch. “Itstrctchcd us out too

thin defensively."

After a scoreless first half, the
Norse scored the game’s only goal in
the second. With starting fullbacks
Dave Eslinger and Nick Johnson in
jurcd, the Grinncll defense fell apart.
“The lack of depth at the fullback
position really showed," commented
Pfitsch.

A highlight forthc Pioneers was
the play of goalkeeper Nate
Brennaman, whotnade ihincen saves.
“ We never seen anyone play a more
beautifulgamc. chas fantastic and
Without him, we would have been
inundated,“ said Ptiisch.

Pfitsch. "It was the kind ofgame we
expected, and theyjust outplayed us.
However, I'd like to play this game
over at the end of the season."

In Sunday’s consolation game,
the Pioneers took on Siena Heights.
Suffering the aftcrralfccts of the pro
vious day’s defeat, Grinncll played
an extremely flat opening half, “it
was the worst half I've seen a Grinr
ticll soccer team play in the last five
years,” suid‘Pfltsch.

However. Grinncll lttmcd its
game around. in lhe first 10 minutcs
ofthcsccond period Neil Goodspeed,
DimiterGeorgiev and Ryan McGary
scored to scal the victory and raise
the team's record to 2~l. The Pio-
neers play Coc today a14:30 pm.
