Sadly, is was here rhar realrlife
rragedy srruck when his wile
Sharon Tate was murdered by the
Manson family.

Knife in the Water, a tight»
knit drama about three people
alone together on a boat, is a
showpice for Polanski’s intense
style which, unlike Hitchcock’s7
tends more toward surprise than L
suspense. Time Magazine said of
Knife: “Polanskisends his inquis—
itive camem whirring from port
to starboard, bow to stem and up .
the mast. Every twitch of an eye, _
lid tells a stinging tnrth. Polanski,
is, for sure, an artist." , .,'
