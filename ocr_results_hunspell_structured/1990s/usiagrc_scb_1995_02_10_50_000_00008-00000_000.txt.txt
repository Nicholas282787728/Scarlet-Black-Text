Can’t Talk, Eatzng!

By JED ORTH, JASON WOLF,

nstend of reviewing this week's
Imeals, we wanted to brag about
the big heist we pulled offearlier
this week. Did you notice how dif-
ﬁcult it was to get reﬁlls on chicken

patty parmesan lastnight? Itwas not
because of the high demand for this
delicacy. The real reason tor the
apparent shortage was that for every
chicken patty we ate for dinner last
night, we have seven or eight care
tons waiting for us in our secret
booty freezer.

When the armored car came to
Quad With the chicken patty Sl’llpr
ment early Thursday morning, we
were ready for action. Dressed in
LL, Bean swat gear and armed to
the teeth, our plan was carried out to
perfection, Matt provided cover by
distracting Dave McConnell, who
was supervising the delivery. i-ic
accomplished this by telling one of
his rambling, endless stories that ale
ways seem to go off on a tangent,

MATl' HABER & ION ROSE

Like that time that he told us
about the onion he had tied onto
his belt. That being the fashion
in those days
0k, Matt’s not allowed to type
anymore. Back to our story. Jed,
who was disguised as the vampire
hat who lives in the chandelier in
Quad, ziprlined down to the delivr
ery truck with the goal of snatching
the booty (say that 10 times fast) in
his bat-like talons. Unfortunately,

Smashing into the side of the truck
naked as the day he was born, Jed set
the stage for phase phi
With hawk like reﬂexes, Jon and
Jason leapt from the bushes and
sprang into action, Whiletheguards
were discussing how a naked slur
dent came to be lying next to the
truck. Jon andlasondisan-ned them.

over beef chtmlchangas and spicy
vegan colache (poor vegans), they
rendered the guards helpless.

By this time, McConnell was fast
asleep thanks to Matt’sstories. This
launced phase gammargammarbo-
bamma. Matt pulled up in hispickup
truck for us to unload the goods,
While Jed lay naked as a jaybird on
the ground, Jon and Jason cracked
the safe on the armored delivery car.
Using the polyfuse method, they had
the lock busted in less than thirty
seconds. Of course, Matt had al-
ready started unloading boxes since
he had entered the vault by going
throughthescreendoorinthclruck's
cab.

Studying in Nantes, France

ELLO from the beautiful
city of Nantes. France,
This is the third week that

[have been here and everything is
going very well. It rained non-stop

Nantes is a moderately large
city of500,000
located at the

Loire River I

huiiding over-
looking the Loire. It's just me
and an older woman named Ma-

:tlame Nicolas. she is extremely

sweet, spunky and tiny. (She is
more than 3 times my age and
she has a much more exciting
social life than I do). But when
she is not out on the town, we
eat dinner together, watch teler
vision or play Scrabble. She
calls me her “petite
Americaine," which I think is
funny considering I am a foot
taller than her,

IES has already taken us on
two field trips. The first was a
day trip to Mon St. Michel and
St. Male and last weekend we
visited Chateaux de la Loire and
had two hours free in tours. l
was really sick when we went to
Mont St. Michel and the bus
ride and stairs to climb didn‘t
help butlhad agreal time on the
Chateaux trip The castles were

lunch are very unimportant
meals here. Lunch is usually'

Just a sandwich (a baguette sands
wich) eaten on the go. Dinner is
more substantial, usually soup,
a main course, salad, bread, fruit
and cheese (and cake if you're
lucky), But they don‘t eat dine
net until 8 or9 p m. and it doesn‘t
seem like they snack at all, I, however.
am trying to suppress the urge to sample
a new pastry every day (although i am a
slave to pain au chocolat).
