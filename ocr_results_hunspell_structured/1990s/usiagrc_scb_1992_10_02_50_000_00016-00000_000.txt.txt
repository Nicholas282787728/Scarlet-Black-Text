Fletcher t0 'liberals': Know thy enemy

WAKE-UP
CALL

by Christopher Fletcher

For a group of people who take
so many social studies courses, and
who are so active in so many causes.
and who hold such definite and often
extreme positions on every issue, a
lot of Grinnell College students cerv
Iainly don’t know how to argue very
effectively. If there is one lesson that
Icould teach Grinnellians, especially
Grinnell “liberals," it would be this:
Know thy enemy, The enemy cer»
Iainly knows you.

People who are accustomed to
believing matthey are correct, people
who are certain that they have the
answers to the big questions of the
day, people who feel they are in the
majority of Opinion on the big is-
sues, tend to slide ﬁrst into complae
cency, then into intellectual incom-
petence and then into intolerance,
They believe it is unimportant to fur»
ther study the looming questions and
controversies. They become unre-
ceptive to contrary opinions and new
outlooks. Instead of meeting chal-
lenge head on, they duckit,and when

they can‘tduck it they try to suppress
its source. I have often encountered
people like this who deliberately
shicld themselves from ideas and
opinions that they suspect they will
not like. These statemens fairly de-
scribe a large segment of our own
numbers.

These pages contain a column
by Mike Washbum which will al—
most certainly enrage a number of
our readers. They will send to me
letters blasting him as a racist and a
hatemonger, a eugenicistand aNazi.
Some readers might even take the
lead of Ms. Felin who, in last week‘s
letter to the editor. said that her ﬁrst
reaction after reading Mike‘s piece
wastoconsidersomemeansofelimi-
nating him from the Scarlet & Black.
Whatmeprocedure for thismightbc.
I cannot imagine—I am the editor of
these pages, and I would rejectabso-
lutely any such mover

Mike Washburn, whatever you
may think of his opinions and ap-
proaches, has one great ability that
many Grinnellians do not. That is the
ability to present an argument in a
coherent fashion, utilizing some sort
of evidence as its support This
method is virtually the raison d’ctre
of the social sciences, yet so many
very vocal members of our commu-

nity seem to think that it is com-
pletely unnecessary when issues of
deep personal concern arise.

Whether the reader ﬁnds one of
our columnist’s stated opinions ap-
palling is unimportantin itself, That
is how debate is He has the right to
state his view, and the reader has the
right to respond in like manner. Like
manner does not include censorship,
physical assaults or threats of J udCo
action. This is all part of a grand old
American tradition that I happen to
love dearly. It is called the free press.

Mike publishes a newspaper.
New students have not yet seen an
issue of the Grinnell Spectator. but
hopefully one will be out next week.
The Spectator came into existence
largely because no fonlm existed for
expressing“unorthodox"views. The
Scarlet & Black, sadly, was once in
the business of suppressing dissent
by exclusion. Whether or not you
like the Spectator or agree with any
of its content, I still ask that you
please read it. This is a panofknow-
ing one’s enemy if one is on the
opposite sideof the ideological fence
from Washbum’s writers.

While the views that Mike ex—
presses in his column here and the
positions taken by the Spectator writ-
ersarenottypical ofGrinnell’smain-

stream, Mike and some ofhis writers
have a considerable advantage over
many very vocal Grinnellians when
putting forth an argument or stating a
position. Even if their conclusions
are entirely wrong or based on distor-
tions of evidence, at least they use
evidence and possess information.
Mike knows his enemy, My col-
league reads left-wing journals to
keep abreast of the what the opposi»
tion is doing and saying, But how
many Grinnell “liberals" ever pick
up a copy of the National Review,
The American Spectator or the Con-
servative Chronicle?

The“liberal"position,whatever
that is, might be in the majority at
Grinnell,butoutin America, it’sstill
too close to call, at least as far as
power is concerned. The religious
right is stronger titan ever, Abortion
rights are still ambiguous, There is
noERA. George BushisintheWhite
House. If you hate these situations.
how are you going to do anything
about them if you are not properly
armed intellectually?

PatBuchanan cancitenumcrous
opleces of evidence and incidents in
history which, after he has worked
them over in his peculiar way, seem
to support positions that so many of
us ﬁnd repugnant. I would bet lhata

lotof my readersknowsomehow that
Buchanan is evil, but how many of
them can cite speciﬁc examples of
his writing which prove it? He and
his friend Pat Robertson wrote your
president‘s national party platform
this year. If you are his enemy, then
you are in danger, because he and his
friends are well-equipped to destroy
you, They have money, press and
power. They can use yourown come
placency, ignorance and sclferigh-
teousness against you because you
will not bother to stock your own
arsenal.

How many of you cancite recent
Supreme Court rulings that attack
Constitutional liberties? How many
of you are aware of the situation in
Alabama or what they are voting on
this November in Oregon and C010-
rado? How many of you have ever
thought twice about Mandela or the
American Civil War?

People here so often take ada»
mantpositions,butuninformedones.
Whatever you might think of Mike
and his views on the world, please at
least do as much work as he does and
try to understand what you are talk-
ing about before you become adar
mantabout itiand especially before
you try to shut someone else up.

Kambouroglou slams handling of Sanchez case

by Alexander
Kambouroglou

What happened to Bruno
Sanchez last Thursday is a very seri-
ous matter to me for two reasons,
The first is that the French Assistant
was a very good friend of mine. The
second reason is that the way the
College handled the situation has re~
deﬁned myperception of this institu-
tion, and consequently where I stand
in relation to its administration.

Firstofall,isn'titthemostironic
thing to ﬁre someone on the basis of
drug use and alcohol consumption,
when, regardless of what the law
states, it is common knowledge and
experience that so many people in
both the student and the faculty/staff
body do the same? Especially when
the police have not been involved,
theCollege has no business intruding
into people’s private lives. Or if it
decides to do so, then all drug and
alcohol usersirt this institution should
beprosecuted and dismissed, I don’t
understand: how did the College ex-
pect the student body, or any thinkv
ing person on this campus, to receive
the explanations offered without
smilingback ironically? Myimpres-
sion is that Grinnell has made ajoke
ofitself within its own community.

Secondly, thereisahurnan lights
issue at stake here. I am confident
that the College has followed all the
legally required steps in dismissing

Sanchez. However, the dismissal
was based on suspicions and circum-
stantial evidence. The college never
intended to give Sanchez a chance to
defend himself. Instead, he was
treated like a criminal, like a public
threat. in the most humiliating man-
ner. AndIask myself: whoiscausing
all this? Grinnell College, one of the
most liberal schools in this “free"
nation, the college that is promoting
humanintegrity.humanrights,equalr
ity,multiculturalism,andtomorrow's
educated, able, and wise leaders of
this country. This same institution is
treating a human being with utter
disrespect, and is refusing to grant
him his basic human rights. Even if
the law does not require it, the Col-
lege should have made sure, as a
matter of principle, that it gave
Sanchez fair treatment 7 It should
be a moral imperative for Grinnell
College if it is what it claims to be.
But no, a hearing was out of the
question. During his meeting last
week with Dean Duke and Dean
Crady, Sanchez says he asked for
some kind of a hearingprocedure in
order for him to defend himself One
of the deans responded by letting
Sanchez know that ifhe didn‘t com;
ply, they would then call the police
and have them conduct a search of
his room, said Sanchez. Now, you
tellme,whatkindofarcactionisthat
coming from a Dean. According to
Sanchez, duoughout the entire meet
ing, Torn Crady was acting as ifhe

felt threatened, Could itbe that our
deans have lost their ability to judge
when they are threatened and when
they are not? Or could it be that this
institution doesn’t know how to re-
spond anymore when the issue of
harrassment comes up, especially
between a man and a woman?

So why is this all happening? Is
it because Sanchez was not doing his
job as a language assistant well
enough? Impossible, sincetheFrench
Department itself asked Sanchez to
return and work for a second year.
Then what? This is what] have seen
happening: Bruno Sanchez is an
eccentric, pompous, many times are
rogant, too often orally aggressive,
person, with a very different and in—
tensely outlined culture, who because
of all of those reasons has gotten on
people‘s nerves many times in the
past. Sanchez is also a person who
does not hesitate to speak up and
stand for what he believes. When he
was put in the French house the in-
evitable happened: seven of its resi-
dents did notget along with him, and
regarded him as being “offensive". (
Oh how beautifully people have
learned to use this word in this land.)
Following the typical high school
andGrinnellCollege habit,thcse stu-
dents got together and made deci-
sions regarding behavioral patients
in the house, and then presented their
decisions to Sanchez de facto. And
maybcsome oftheircomplainmwcre
well grounded, yet, the way the deci

sions were made and the way they
were presented, it only remirtds one
of high school when criticism takes
place behind the concerned party’s
back. So there is this small group of
immature spoiled kids complaining
to the college, You see these kidsi
because they can only he considered
to be kidsihave justdiscovcred this
new game which is called “rights.”
And what a fun game ll is when, if
properly manipulated, it can free one
from personal problems. Because
that's all there is to _it. These kids
could simply not tolerate something
so much different from what they
are. Sanchez was a mirror to their
boring petty little world. He pointed
out to them that it is outrageous to
blame a person behind their back,
and that itis wrongtoexpectolhers to
act the way you want them to. It
turns out that they could not tolerate
that, so this different, arrogant per-
son had to go.

The shocking part is that the
college backed up these brats. Come
on Grinnell College, don’t tell me
lhal in almost 150 years you haven’t
realized that halfof the world’s coir
lcgc students are still spoiled brats,
and that they are kidsyustoutoftheir
sholterodlittlehomes tllatdonotknow
how to communicate with or under-
stand othcrs, And this is the reason
why you are promoting
multiculturalism with such
“strength",sotllatthcsekidscanopen
up their minds. How do you expect

them to open up their minds when
you fire Sanchez based on mere ac»
cusations? Or is it that you yourself
are not as anti-racist, anlirscxist and
anti-discrimination as you claim to
be? Because it looks to me, and
others on the outside, that you your
self could not stand Bruno Sanchez
because he was a little more difficut
to deal with. Shouldallofus unpopu»
lar people fear the same treatment?
Beware Mike Washburn, next See
mester it might be your turn, if all it
takes is for anyone to simply accuse
you of smoking marijuana or refus-
ing to leave their room when asked
to.

Unfortunately,GrinnellCollegc
insists on remaining silent. Well, if
that is the case, I can’t help but be-
lieve that these thoughts are true. 1
only wish that someone from this
school would talk and prove me
wrong, because as it is I have lostall
respect and love for this institution.
And no matter how I try to come up
with arguments that would support
Grinnell’s actions, I still cannot un-
derstand how on earth they could
have treated a person with such poor
regard. As far as I know, there is
already one student, who because of
what Grinnell has done, will be
ttansfering next year. Maybe losing
precious klds would motivate you to
explain WHY?
