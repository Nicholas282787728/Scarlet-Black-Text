Letters from the Old World
Part IV — London

IVING in a city the size of
L Grinnell, one finds it diffi-
cult to stay up-to-date with
the fashion world. Few studentshave
the time, desire or energy to put into
worrying about what they are going
to wear. Even when students get a
chance to go to Des Moines, few
students can afford really nice clothes.
letaloneaccessories. This iswhy many
students, particularly at Grinncll, buy
used and vintage clothes.
Grinnellians have had this
“grunge” look since the 1960's, sim-
ply because it's the easiest way to
dress. Watching MTV, I realized
that the “us “ or “grunge" look is
still in, and has become mainstream.

Major fashion designers are asks
ing hundreds of dollars for clothes
that are made to look used. I’ve
found used jeans at high fashion
stores, asking twice the price that
used clothes stores and consignment
shops would normally ask. It seems
almost obvious to those who would
prefer nottospendanexcess of money
to simply buy the clothes used at the
places that sell them cheap. Some of
the most fashionable people I know
buy most of their clothes used.

To test how affordable and nice
used clothes could be. I decided to

nell. Along with me on myadventure
was my friend and fashion maven
Gracy Beeler, as well as Toben
Galven, an 5&8 photographer to help
us document our discoveries.

The clothes we found ranged
from two to 45 dollars. There were
racks of women‘s and men's clothm,
a range of accessories and a selection
of vintage clothing with items from
the l940‘s through the 1970's.

some cowboy boots. She came out of
the dressing room strutting her stuff.
Bubs and Debbie, the friendly sales
ladies working that day, let out a big
“ooh“ as she walked by them.

Meanwhile I found a thirtyrdol—
lar ﬂuffy white dress in the prom/
evening gown section. The sales la-
diw put together a hat. long silk
gloves, anda small fur for around my
neck. I felt like a Southem belle on
her wedding day.

The second outfit Gracy found
was a white and gold dress with spa-
ghetti straps. She added a fur coat. a
long dangling pearl necklace (ﬁfty
cents) and gold heels (two dollars) to
go along with it. She looked quite
glamorous.

I found a vintage brown jacket
with a velvet lapel for only twelve
dollars. I wore it with a long green
corduroy skirt(three dollars),abrown

from Georgia) and I started talking about a trip to London. It was a Thursday when we, in one of our

spur-of—the—momentdecisions that have come to characterize life here at Lancaster, decided to take off.
We threw some clothes into our day packs (this time I left the Nonon Anthology behind) and left messages on
our e-mail accounts beforeleaving.

We took the 13:50 train out of Lancaster and arrived at Euston Station in London around 17:00. Stepping
outsidc,wewere overwhelmed. Suddenly, wewonderedjust what we were doing. ltwas growing dark and people
hustled around us everywhere. We headed down Euston Road, stopping at McDonald's to ask for directions to
Oxford Street, one of London's main shopping streets. It started to rain on us and we ran down Oxford Street,
dodging in and outof the crowd, looking ridiculous,our huge daypacks bouncing all around. Drenched, cold and
hungry, we ﬁnally found the youth hostel just off Oxford Street on a rundown and dark sidestreet

We ate squashed and wet peanut butter and jelly sandwiches from our packs, cleaned up, and then took off
to explore London and its nightlife. We headed down into Soho, an area of London known for its character and
variety. Elegant, expensive restaurants, theaters and moviehouses lined the main streets, while just one block
away on lesser sidestreets striptease joints and sleazy rent»by»thehour hotels called out for attention. A ticket
hawker rushed up to us. "Need tickets for tonight's show? The show‘s sold out fora year. . . you can't get them
anyplace else." We bargained with him, and finally settled on a reasonable, yet expensive, price. We went into
the theater feeling conspicuous dressed in our jeans and soiled traveling clothes The show was magniﬁcent.
Afterwards, we wandered back through Picadilly Circus to Leicester Square, a large squarewhere predominately
young people gather at night. We listened to street musicians and watched a young man tap dancing for money,
and then waited in line for a nightclub, but quickly gotout of line when we discovered that the entrance fee to the
dance club was ten pounds.

Friday morning we headed to Parliament Square, home of Big Ben. We wandered into the House of
Commons. Security was incredible. We passed through two security sites (including metal detectors and
scanners) and were personally padded up and down by armed guards before we were finally allowed into the
visitor's gallery where we found a very dull and boring debate ensuing abouta minor reform bill. in fact. there
were only two or three members of Parliament actually present that day.

We left and walked past Downing Street We were hoping to takeapicture of Number Ten Downing Street,
where Prime Minister John Major is, but couldn't get past the security gate, so we moved on, petting the horses
atthe HorseGuards before ending up at the NationalGalleryinTrafalgaquuare. By this time,ourfeet were killing
us, our packs were growingincreasingly heavy, and we were irritable and hungry. McDonald's was the only place
that actually had seating available and where you didn't have to pay extra to eat your food inside, so we are there
McDonald‘s had never looked so good! After a nearly twohourrestat McDonald‘s, Jason and I headed down the
Strand, a major thoroughfare in London. We found Covent Gardens. a fruit-and-vegetable market made famous
in "My Fair lady." There we listened to two comedians making fun of Americans before purchning cheap tickets
for that evening's performance of "Miss Saigon" on Catherine Street

We had been told that we had to see S t Paul's Cathedral, the largest church in London. We decided we wanted
to see the View fmm the top of the cathedral, so we paid ﬁve pounds to climb S98 steep spiral steps. It was windy
and cold at the top, and my fear of heights suddenly kicked in. so we stayed at the top for only a moment. long
enough to take a few pictures, before slowly making our way down.

By this time, Jason and l were beat and just wanted to take our packs off and rest in a hostel, so we headed
off in search of iL it was around 4 pm. and we had three and a half hours until that evening's performance, long
enough to ﬁnd the hostel, eat, and relax -- or so we thought We decided to take our first ride on the Underground
(London's subway system) at ntsh hour on a Friday. What a mistake! It was so crowded that we had trouble
keeping track of one another and we were confused by the signs and stations. It was 6 pm. before we finally
reached Hampstead Heath. We walked out of the stadon scowling and irritable and started walking up a steep
hill where the hostel was supposedly located. But we couldn't ﬁnd the place. In frustration and utter exhaustion,
we collapsed in someone's yard and refused to move. We just sat there staring atone another, about ready to burst
into tears, realizing how foolish we were. We had just can‘ied our packs around all day, had spent loads of money
and time on the Underground, only to get us out in the middle of nowhere away from everything we wanted to
see, and we still had to go back into town to see "Miss Saigon." Jason grabbed my arm and yanked me along back
to the station. We took the Underground back to Oxford Street and got the lastroom available that night. We took
a taxi to the theater and arrived two minutes before the cunain.

Our London weekend had been so intense that Jason andI were quite happy to get back to mellow Lancaster
on Sunday. Once back, we decided to stick around Lancaster for a couple of weeks before taking off on any more
adventures. Next week, I might even talk about the academics, which I am doing, believe it or not!
