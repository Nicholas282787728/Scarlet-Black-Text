Men Win Two of Final Three

By Charlie Frago

The last two weeks have
been eventful for the Grinnell
mens basketball program.
After losses to Coc, 65-55, and
Cornell, 84-57, Coach
Arsenauit stressed to the team
the importance of winning
against Illinois College, in part
to avoid a conference shut-out.
but primarily to avenge an
earlier 9549 loss to Illinois in
Jacksonville. The squad
responded by squeaking out a
67-66 win over the Blueboys in
a game which kept the few
hundred extremely polite and
well behaved fans enthralled
until the final buzzer. Senior
Mike Spurbeck hit two free
throws with four seconds
remaining to seal the win for
the Pioneers, their first
conference win of the season and
their second win overall.

The game followed the
typical pattern: strong Grinnell
spurts followed by dry spells
that could deforest the Amazon.
This time, however, the
Pioneers had obviously watched
the Doulgas-Tyson fight in the
pregame film session, as they
pulled themselves up from the
canvas to knock the Blueboys
back to Jacksonville, As junior
swingman Dave Chamberlain
remarked, “Even though we
didn’t perform well. we knew
we would win...we had to get
them back.” Ah. revenge...,the
second best feeling iii the world.
Chris “Sgt. Fury" Jacobson led
all scorers with 24 points and
Spurbeck added 13,

knox College came to
Darby as the third place team in
the South division. But
Grinnell apparently forgot to
read the standings as they
thoroughly defeated the Siwash,
84-77. The guard tandem of
Holland Neal and Wendell
Barber combined for 31 points
while making Knox look really
stupid. Barber added 6 assists in
his ﬁnest collegiate pcrfomtance
to date. Concaptain Spurbeck
summed up the victory with the

explanation that, “this was the
first game in which we came to
play for forty minutes."

After tripling their previous
victory total in a single
weekend, one might expect
Grinnell to start out a little ﬂat
in their season finale against
Clarke College. A little flat!
The Pioneers played like a can
of Coke that had been left open
for a couple of weeks. To say

that Clarke's 77-61 victory was

anything other than a cakewalk
is a gross understatement.
Grinnell never found its rhythm.
when Jacobsen misses two
dunks things are definitely out
of synch. and the dissapointing
result dampened the final game
of seniors Spurbeck, Scott
Whipple and Bill Collins.
Whipple did finish strongly
with 10 points and 7 rebounds

Relay Smashes Pool, Team Records

By Holly Kcllar

The Grinnell Invitational
meet this past Saturday was an
exciting one for the women‘s
swimming and diving team, as
the 800 freestyle relay team
consisting of Amy Oggel,
Alyson Jepsen, Shannon
Swanstrom, and Mercedes
Danforth finished with a first
place that broke the old school
and pool records. “They swam
absolutely out of their heads,“
said coach Sheila Cain, “It was
just outstanding." The new
record is now 8:24.95, beating
the old school record of 8:360.
and the old pool record of 8128

held by a team from Lake
Forest. Cain went into the
meet with the goal of breaking
that record, and said that the race
was “a whole team effort." Each
of the four members of the relay
team finished her 200 with a
season-best time. Cain believes
that this team has a chance of
winning this event at the
Conference meet coming up this
weekend.

The Invitational, which was
supposed to include a total of
seven competing teams, turned
out to be a very “light meet“
involving only Grinnell,
Cornell, and Knox widt several
other teams not making the trip

to Grinnell for one reason or
another. Because of this, team
scores were not kept, but the
Pioneers certainly had a good
number of top finishers.

Looking ahead to the
Conference meet this weekend at
Coe, Cain says that Grinnell is
“right where we want to be...
We‘re at the end of our taper
phase and we' re more than ready
for Conference.“ Cain was “very
pleased with everybody“ on
Saturday, saying that the team
swam well for that meet.
“We‘re saving for
Conferencc....Wc’re ready to
swim fast,...tapcred, shaved and
with one suit.“

because of all the tremendous
competition in the division."

Last Saturday, while
clinching the division title,
Grinnell posted an impressive
82-60 victory over Illinois
College. The victory was made
even sweeter because of a last»

Men‘s Swimming

Casual Invitational
Prepares Swimmers
for Conference

By Steve Clem

Members of the Grinnell
Men’s Swim Team spent last
Saturday enjoying themselves in
the P.E.C. pool. Coach Ray
Oberrniller changed the format
of the annual Grinnell
Invitational, allowing no team
points to be scored. This
allowed the men to enter
unfamiliar events without the
pressure to win. Though team
members kicked back and put up
their feet, and there was no
score, the Pioneers dominated
their opponents. The teams
competing with Grinnell wcrc
Cornell and Knox Colleges.

Senior CoACaptain Paul
Froese summed up the meet
best. “The Invitational was so
laid back. Basically it was just
a screw-around type of meet, and
we did some fun things.
Anyone who wasn’t there to see
it missed an enjoyable
afternoon.“

Though there were many
outstanding performances, the
only double winners in
individual events were Phil
Bishop, Luther Davis. and
David Ressncr. Bishop won
both diving events, while Davis
won the 50 free and 200 I.M..
and Ressner won the 100 fly and
100 breast. Other individual
Grinnell winners included Mike
Kraus (1650 free), John
Williams (200 free), Steve Lisio

(100 free), John Bergerson (100
back), and Joe Zimsen (400
I.M,).

In the relay events, Grinnell
won the 200 and 400 medleys,
as well as the 200 and 400 free
relays. The Pioneers also tallied
many 2nd and 3rd place results.
Other fine performers included
Charlie Murrin in the freestyle
sprints, J.P. Fiening in the 200
free and 400 I.M., and Jason
(Fred) Martin in the 400 I.M.

Coach Obermiller will now
begin to “taper" the team.
Team workouts will gradually
get shorter in distance. which
allows the swimmers‘ muscles
to “build, back up." This
technique is usually suitable
just one or two times a year,
and Obermiller prefers to wait
until the Midwest Conference
Meet to begin the taper. The
Pioneers have no meets this '
weekend, allowing the team to .
concentrate entirely on next
weekend‘s Conference Meet in ‘
Appleton. Wisconsin. When
Froese was asked about the
chances of a Pioneer “three-peat" <
at Conference, the Captain was ,
not at a loss for words.
“Confercnce7...Aftcr much
discussion with Coach
Obermiller, and careful research
into the strengths and
weakncsses of our opponents, I
think it‘s safe to say we’re
gonna kick _i"
