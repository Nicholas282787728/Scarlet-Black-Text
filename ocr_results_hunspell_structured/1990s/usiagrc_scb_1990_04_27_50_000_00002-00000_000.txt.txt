SGA Amends USSA Proposal

By Jessrca Weisel

After last week‘s battle at loint
Board over the creation of the new
parliamentarian/student group liai-
son position, SGA held a less cone
frontational meeting this week,
managing to amend the proposal,
drop a controversial measure. and
pass it overwhelmingly for the first
time.

The new position will serve as a
contact between student organiza-
tions and SGA, as well as carry on
the duties now performed by the
parliamentarian,

Wednesday' 5 debate centered on
the proposed afﬁliation of the col-
lege with the United States Student
Association (US SA), a lobbying
group composed of students, that
has traditionally been active in sup»
porting left-wing political causes.

Many students complained that
membership in USSA would po-

snmed, prohibits the use of student
government funds for the purchase
of alcohol, and notes the inadmissi-
bility of intoxication as an excuse
for the violation of college rules
and regulations,

The policy. however, also reads:
“Grinnell College is not a law en-
forcement agency and does not
assume responsibility for enforc-
ing the state liquor laws. The col—
lege does urge students to familiar-
ize themselves with the slate laws
and conform to them. The college
believes that each student must
determine for him/herself whether
or not to use alcohol."

Jones said that these statements
reﬂect the college's policy on stu
dent life. “Grinnell’s policy is an
assumption that a liberal arts colr
legc should develop tlle enure per-
son.” The policy emphasizes the
importance of student growth and
development, the promotion of

liticize SGA and the rights of stu-
dents who hold minority, or unr
popular, views mightbe neglected.
KaeBendixen, SGA treasurer, said
that if the school joins, every stu-
dent will become a member, a situa
ation to which anumbcrof students
at the meeting objected.

The proposal's backers, Rashmi
Dyal-Chand and Thom Main, as-
sistant treasurer, had suggested the
USSA afﬁliation would help SGA
represent student groups to “na-
tional lawmakers." It would also
help student groups network with
groups at other colleges and uni-
versitiesr

USSA represents 200 campuses
around the United States. Each par-
ticipating school sends between
three and eight delegates to the
national conference held each

delegation of three, leading some

students to have the freedom to
“learn and make mismkes without
facing devastating results," Jones
said, He added that the support
system of faculty and student staff
assists students with that freedom.

Jones also said that the Act
emphasizes greater institutional
responsibility; Grinnell's current
policy, therefore, may be liberal by

the college that additional, more
speciﬁc informationon therequire-

during May.

“What isn’t clear is what com-

Maria Georgo, director of student
activities. “it‘s hard to tell what

ing to question whether Grinnell
would be able to affect the national
platform,

After some short debate on the
affiliation, Bendlxen proposed an
amendment that would remove the
USSA membership from the by-

ticipation in a natlonal lobby day,
during which interested students
could express their concern to
members of Congress, The school
would not have to be a member of
the organization to join on this day.
Funding for the lobby day may be
provided by SGA conference fund.

The amendment was viewed as
a good compromise, because it es—
tablished the new position, and, as
Bob Reason said. “is a great way
not to politicize student govem-
merit here."

SGA must pass the bylaw pro»

proposal to go into effect.

nell will have to alter its current
policies to adapt to the new rcgual-
lions. "There is no question that the
college will haveto expandilsalco—
hol and drug awareness programs,
improve its substance abuse safety
net. and impose penalties on stu-
dents who areviolating state or fed—
eral law in their use of alcohol or
drugs," he said.

However. Killion added, the
regulations do not stipulate how the
college should apprehend students
who are violating the law. This is
left tothe discretion of each institur
tion. "I'm arguing that Grinnell
should not aggressively attempt to
discoverwhich students are violat-
tng the law," Killion said. “This
approach would allow Grinnell to
comply with federal law without
becoming a police state."
