musicians so in tune with each other.”
TheSariFrarttircaBay Guardian Said
of their Bay Area concert: “Together
Fries/en and Kropinski range beyond
the typical bondsofduo performance.
As they play both percussion chords
and lines, their two instruments be—
come virtually a quartet.”

MOVIE SHORTS

 

Breaking Away

Breaking Away is a cycling movie in the fine sporting tradition of Rocky, The Karate K id, and all of the
other stand-up-andrcheer-in-your-seat films that periodically come out of Hollywood. Nonetheless,
director Michael Thompson does a fine job of preventing the movie from becoming yet another mass of
Liaining scenes. The heroes of this 1980 film are four Indiana townies: Mike (Dennis Quaid), Carl (Daniel
Stern), Mooch (David Block), and the Italian-loving racer Dave (Dcnnis Christopher). Dave spends his
time (to the dismay of his parents) in training, waiting for the day he can go to Italy and become a real racer.
The tone ofBreakirigAwuy,however,does notsiay lightasihis film examines the hopelessness ofthe four's
lives. Antagonism between father and son changes from humorous to dramatic, and the raihcr comic
relationship between Dave and collegergirl Catherine becomes serious. Although there is a great reunion
after the ﬁnal race Scene, many questions about the group‘s future are left unanswered, BreakingAwoy will
be shown on Saturday at 7:30 in Harris Cinema. -Rhys Jones

In Drugstore Cowboy, Matt Dillon and a group of fellow junkies attempt to maintain their dmg-addiciod
lifestyle by robbing pharmacies. This film presents a stark, realistic portrayal oi‘ajunkie’s life. Drugstore

Little Nikita

Little Nikita stars Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent and River Phoenix as a young California kid who wants
to get into the Air Force Academy. There’s one problem --thc kids parents are spies. A thriller wanna-be,
Little Nikita would have made an okay TV movie, but itdoesn‘t work as a feature film. Littie Nikita will
be shown on Saturday at 8:30 in North Lounge. ~Louise Alcom

Running On Empty

Rim/ting 0n Empty gives a fascinating look into a farnily on the run. Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti are
former “ﬂower children" who protested the Vietnam War by blowing up a napalm plant. The explosion
killed a man, and the couple and their two sons have been trying to avoid the FBI ever since, More conﬂict
arises when the older son, played by River Phoenix, bcgms to long for a life of his own; he is torn between
his love for his family and the pursuit of his own dreams. Running On Empty will be shown on Sunday

at 8:30 in North Lounge.

James Bond camps it up in Octopussy

to tell her what she is doing. They
become allies, they have sex, and
the bad guys are foiled. Typical

By Louise Alcom

Yes, Octopurry is a James Bond
ﬂick. A pretty typical one, as well.
This is Roger Moore’s 1983 outing
as the dashing agent 007. licensed to
kill (plotlines. mostly). OK, I won't
be TOO cynical. It‘s no art film, but
it is rousing good fun. Lots of funky
special effects and neat toys (cour-
tesy of Q).

OK, the plot. Bad guy military
types from the Soviet Union are try»
ing to start a war with the West be
cause they are afraid that, with the
improving relations between the US
and the USSR, they will be out of a
job. One wonders if the recent coup
attempt could have been the result of
watching too many Bond flicks???

Anyway, these bad dudes decide
to use the network of a high class
smuggler to plant the seeds of war.

Enter ()ctopussy, a beautiful woman
(played by Moore‘s wife, Maud
Adams, by the way) with an empire
to rival the Mafia. She lives on an
island with ti band of buxom women
who do her dirty work. She unwitr
tinglyhelpsthebadguys...cnierBond

Bond stuff. Fust»paced, basic
Bond. My advice? Watch itfor the
toys. Octopurry will be shown on
Friday at 8:30 in North Lounge.

Chocolat presents a unique,
touching intercultural friendship

By Brett Fcchheimer

Chocolat, a French movie released
in 1989, examines the sensitive rcla»
tionship between a young French girl
and the African who is her family's
house servant. Sctin the 1950's in the
French West African colony of
Cameroon, Chocolaz traces, through
a sequence of ﬂashbacks, the close
