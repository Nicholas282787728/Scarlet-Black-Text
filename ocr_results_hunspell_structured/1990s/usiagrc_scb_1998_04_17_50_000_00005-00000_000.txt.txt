: Strappin on the Feedbag

BY ERIN PETERSON&
REBECCA EILERS
Food Critcs

If we could sum up the restaurant
we visited this week in one word. it
would be this: Cunningham’s. Which
is ironic, since we went to the Mard
Rite. Whoops! That’s next week.

The menu options at Cunningham's
were so mouth»watering that Erin
was salivating through the whole
meal. This was not surprising, espc»
cially since she had the opponunity
to order the exotic peanut butter
sandwich. “I never would've guessed
they’d have these in Iowa! I thought
they were native to Minnesota! 0n
Wonder Bread, too!“ she squealed.
Rebecca, the more cosmopolitan of
the two of us, scoffed in disdain.
“You’re such a goober. Everybody
knows Minnesota makes diddiy
squat." Erin grudgingly admitted that
her parents were actually diddly
squat farmers.

After this revelation. Rebecca
promptly ignored Erin and took a
swig of her carbonated cough syrup.
alternately known as the strawberry
fountain drink. Wow! We didn't re»
alize “over~thevcounter" medicine
could be served over the lunch
counter. We wondered if the police
were going to bust this place.

But we digress. Yet again. While we
pondered this possibility, a fellow
diner. Megan. ordered the 5 cent cof-
fee. She felt it was worth every
penny. But no more.

Unfortunately. all those beverages
had a calamitous side effect on Erin.
Rebecca. who had been denied her
independent poetry major, portrayed
Erin's resulting “spittin‘ machine"
tendencies thusly:

“Hence. the spic and span spit that
she spat in a spot,

Took the space of the place of the
malt of Dave Brott."

Erin congratulated Rebecca on the
spontaneity of her verse. In die mean-
time. Dave gave Erin a look of dis-
gust, and said thoughtfully that his
malt was “good to the last drop, ex-
cept for the drops with spit in it,” We
’ decided to change subjects,
Rebecca was delighted to discover

that her garbage salad did not appear
to contain any actual garbage. In fact.
it was merely a clever ploy to entree
diners. Rebecca marveled at the ef-
fective marketing strategy. “Those
crazy Cunninghamontansl What will
they think of next?" Erin hoped it
would be the BBQ whole diddly
squatwich grinder on a croissant.
Rebecca rolled her eyes. And they
STAYED that way. making the rest
of the meal quite unpleasant,

Rebecca’s dessert of choice, the
Purple Cow, proved to be an intense
combination of grape syrup and va»
nilla ice cream. As Megan astutely
observed. "it tastes like Hubba
Bubba. if you smoked the wrappers,“
The Cunningham’s cooks eyed us
suspiciously after the remark, per-
haps wishing the purple cow had
been apoisan cow.

Erin ordered the Dusty Miller. and
wondered idly why it was named af-
ter the title character in the famous
Herman Melville story. “You igno-
ramus !" screeched Rebecca. “Henry
James wrote that story! Didn't you
pay attention in yourAfn'can Ameri—
can Lit class?" Erin hung her head
in shame and admitted that she was
an incompetent student. and that the
only reason that she had been ac-
cepted to Grinnell was to fulﬁll the
Minnesota quota. She proudly noted
that she was the only one to receive
the coveted “Diddly Squat" Tmstee
Scholarship. named after prestigious
trustee Warren Buffet. (Thanks.
Buffy!)

Much like the garbage salad. we
noted that the “Candyland Sundae, a
GrinnellTradition" contained neither
candy nor land. However, like the
peanut butter sandwich. it did con-
tain peanuts. We congratulated each
other on our keen analysis. The cooks
eyed us suspiciously again, perhaps
wondering why the administration
had let us wander so far from the
campus.

We found Cunningham's to be an
authentic. down»home dining expe-
rience that everyone can enjoy. Ex-
cept for us. because we are preten-
tious and snotty and don‘t enjoy any-
thing.

Don’t Ask Me, I’m Just a Girl

BY LIZZ WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

So I’ve seen a bunch of these peti-
tions going around that complain
about the loud and drunken behav-
ior of Titular Head attendees. Um,
hi. Are you actually stupid or do you
just play stupid on campus? Oh wait.
I know, you‘re just part of that an-
noying conservative presence on this
campus that gets bigger and more
powerful every year. And now you
have petitions so I know who you
are, you complacent motherf**kers.
Did you tell them it was to get Fiona
Apple here next fall? Or Paula Cole?
Ibet you wear the “Grinnell College
150 years of Anarchy and Revolu-
tion" t-shirts and never leave your
dorm room. Except forTitular Head.
It isn‘t a ﬁlm festival. We are not in
Utah and this is not Sundance. I
didn’t see Gwyneth or Parker or even
Robert Redford. Get over yourself,
Titular Head is about making bad
movies (like the farting meat thing),
getting drunk, and making fun of
them. And your friends. And throw-
ing stuff. In public. It's a goddamn
school tradition. Do you want to be
the person who breaks tradition? i'm

guessing no. The name is Titular
Head! This is not a forum for new
and cool indie movies. It’s meant to
be offensive.

Oh yeah. and not everyone yelling
was drunk. like me for example. In
fact. maybe the movies wouldn’t
have been that bad if I had a little
whiskey in my blood. Or a lot. How
about this... I'll make a deal. You
stop making bad movies and I‘ll stop
heckling them. Or maybe I'll sub~
scribe to your idea that Titular Head
is a film festival. that everything
made is art. Well, then. I’m going to
make a bunch of "ﬁlms" about me
and Jenna sitting around watching
TV. It's an. And you will have to sit
through it. Kind of makes you want
a gong. doesn‘t it?

I want to write a petition about how
your oppressive, Fascist behavior
makes the school look bad to friends,
specs. and parents. People like you
attract the wrong kind of student to
Grinnell. My roommate was a spec
atTH. three years ago and liked the
craziness and yelling and overall bad
behavior. I like my roommate.
Hence, by the transitive property, you
suck.

Oh. and ifyou‘re going to write stu—
pid petitions. can we please keep
people from screaming. shouting.
running around in sports bras, and
shooting water guns at the library on
aTuesday night? Iwant to go to grad
school. I want to get good grades.
That's why I'm always in the library.
I‘m not there to meet boys. Well.
not usually... Your sophomoric be-
havior (oh wait. you were all first
years) caused me even more stress
in my life than I have already and I
hate you for it. You‘re ugly. annoy-
ing. and Idon‘t like you. Neither do
my friends. Why don‘t you leave?

 

Letters

Dear Editor,

I am writing to notify the Grinnell
College community of an amazing
event going on this weekend in the
Harris Center. Grinnell College
Gamers Guild. a student organiza-
tion. will be having its third senti-

games 7 GrinCon III. Along with
the various games in Harris. we will
also be showing two movies in the
Cinema. The ﬁlms are the sci-ﬁ clas-
sic Tron (ﬁrst movie with computer
graphics — although the kind you
could get out of a Commodore) and
the recent fantasy ﬂick
“Dragonheart.” featuring the voice of
Sean Connery. Snacks and drinks
will be in abundance. thanks to ACE,
and all are welcome. As classes start
to gear up for the ﬁnals rush. or if
you miss Harris after Titular Head.
come on over to the Harris Center!
That’s 8:3075 on Saturday the 18th
7 Let the Games Begin!!!

Ben Jenkins and Brian K. Smith,
Grincon III organizer and Gamers
Guild President

Dear Editor.

This last week has shown me the
best and Worst in Grinnell College
students. After seeing the utter lack
of respect displayed by a few stu-
dents at Titular Head. I was glad to
see my faith in Grinnell, and in the
initiative and moral accountability of
the Grinnell student. buoyed by the
actions zr small group of ﬁrst-year
students. After the dishwasher broke
down at quad last week. a small
group of quad regulars living on
South Campus made a pact not to
return to Quad until the problem was
ﬁxed. to protest to use of disposable
wares there. Every meal, they take
the extra time (perhaps the rarest of
Grinnell resources) to travel to
Cowles. knowing that they‘ll have to
wait in the Cowles line. to eat.
Uninfected with the lethargy that
seems to characterize the corrtmon
image ofGrinnell activism. these 5th
dents have chosen to translate their
personal ideals into positive action.
With understanding and respect for
those who could not (or would not)
join them in their Cowles patronage,
they chose to set an example for oth-

to the editor

ers to follow instead of proselytiz—
ing for their cause. Because of this,
their effom are worth more thanjust
the thirty disposable plates or the
ninety pieces of plasticware they
chose not to use. For their actions,
they deserve praise.

These are the people who inherit
Grinnell, and they deserve it.

With respect and admiration.

TO'ITI'ULAR HEAD AT'I'ENDEES
AND THE GRINNELL COLLEGE
COMMUNITY:

Anyone who attended 1993’s Titu—
lar Head is aware of the disrespect-
ful heckling and general derogatory
comments that were made about
ﬁlms. the mc. audience members,
judges, et cetera. Regardless of quale
ity. all of the films submitted repre—
sent the hard work. creativity, and
diversity of our campus. While some
commentary ceminly can add to the
experience of Titular Head. constant
obnoxious and vulgar comments can
only sour it. Considering that there
were a handful of disruptive audi-
ence members among several hun-
dred others at the concert hall, we
ﬁnd it disappointing that so few ac-
tually stood up for their right to
watch the movies. We feel embar~
rassed to have had prospectives and
families visiting our college while
such activity took place. We pro-
jected an unfonunate image of the
college to these people. an image that
is not in keeping with the spirit of
our school.

Sincerely.

signees of the Titular Head petition
have been ommitted.

Dear Naive First-Year Student.
Self~ governance.
Get used to it.

Love.
The people sitting behind you.

An open letter to the student body:
You know there‘s a problem when

they start yelling “cunt!" at the

screen. I‘m disgusted by the disre-

spectI witnessed this evening at Titu-
lar Head. It angers me that people
assume that weekend nights exempt
them from concern for anyone but
themselves. Consideration for the
well being of other students on this
small campus is often sacriﬁced in
the name of a good time.

It angers me that. when people use
the excuse of a weekend and a lot of
beer to let themselves loose. it ad-
versely affects my life. I'm talking
about the people who have stood
outside Younker Hall at two in the
morning screaming “Let us in! Open
the P”king door!" for twenty min-
utes. I'm talking about the people
who stood outside Younker at one in
the morning making banging noises
and laughing obnoxiously until

nsomeone from the second floor
poured water on their heads. I‘m
talking about the fact that I went to
watch ﬁlms made by students. films
that had a lot of time. effort and cre-
ativity invested in them. but that I
couldn‘t hear the dialogue due to the
vulgar comments of audience mem—
bers.

Maybe I’m a naive ﬁrst-year stu—
dent. Maybe Ijust don’t understand
how it works yet. But I sat down to
Titular Head feeling so proud that
Grinnell has a ﬁlm festival and that
the student body was actively sup-
porting it. I left wishing Ihad a com—
ment sharp enough to shut up the
assholes sitting behind me.

Sincerely.
Elaine Aron "01

To the Grinnell College Commu»
nlty:

Last Saturday‘s Titular Head is an
abominable display which misrep-
resents Grinnell's values.

During the ﬁlm festival. certain
audience members loudly ex-
pressed their personal opinions on
the films. engaging in obnoxious
heckling. Such behavior mined the
night for both ﬁlmmakers and the
audience. Directors saw their
works torn apan. and often the
audience could neither view nor
hear the ﬁlm. as a result of the
offending behavior. It is the
revolting conduct of only a few
that caused the displeasure of many
Saturday night.

We ask that this behavior no longer
be condoned.

We ask that basic human respect
and courtesy be paid to all.

Signed.
