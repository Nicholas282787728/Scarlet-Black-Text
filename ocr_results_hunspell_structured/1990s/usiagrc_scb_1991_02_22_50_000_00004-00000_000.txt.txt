at Knoxville.

Nelson spoke about the political
and psychological implications of
being a gay person of color and his
personal interest in marginal lit»
erature in an introduction to the
lecture,thatfollowed the screening
of My Beautiful Laundretle. He
described the difficulties faced by
gay and lesbian writers of color to
gain academic respectability.

The lecture focused on the
double humiliation and racism ex-
perienced by gay peopleof colorin
England. The issue ofracism which
is facedinpanicularbyimmigmnts
from the Indo~Pakistan subconti-
nent in England, is one of the many
complex themes that are explored
in My Eeautiful Laundrette.

Nelson described how My
Beautiful Laundrette is a “power-
fulantidotetotheimperialillusions
of the British public" after the re-
lease of ﬁlms such asA Passage to
Indiaandlewelinlhemenwhich
pandered to imperial nostalgia. In
My Beautiful Laundrette, the im-
migrants are shown as economi-

Avoiding pitfalls in off-campus housing

By Tam chlvins

To help students determine
where they might like to live nCXt
year and what they should look for
in off»campus housing, a “Work-
shop on Renting Off Campus
Housing” was held on Monday,
February IS. The workshop was
given by NonnaGosselink,Gnnnell
College‘s Director of Housing.
Transportation, and Reprography,
and Shirley McKlbbin, a represen-
tative of First Reality oiGrinnell.

Gosselink stressed the impor»
tance of looking into what type of
lease (ifany) was offered, explains
ing that “ti lease is really for [the
students’] own protection." She
emphasized the importance of
thoroughly inspecting the facilities
and not taking the first house that
you find or that looks good mir
tially. Essential questions include
the provision of utilities, repairs,
whether or not pets are allowed.
decorating theapartment,and other
matters. such as snow removal
policy.

Gossalinkfurtherhighlighted the
need for credit when looking into
housing. She explained that credit
established by one's parents gen-
erally was sullicient,esprx:ially here
in Grinnell but said this could not
be assumed. She explained that
deposits varied and depending on
previous payments on other leases
and bills (such as utilities). the de—
posit could be quite expensive.

According to Gosselink, there
are several landlords in Grinnell
who specialize in student housing.
On the whole. she feels that the
landlords in Grinnell are accoma
modating and accessible. She
commented on the need to build a
good rapport with the landlord from
the start by being honest and open.
With such a relationship, “the
landlords won‘t enter the place
withoutnotifyingthestudents first,“
Gosselinksaid. ‘Thelandlordshave
a right to do periodic, non-an-
nounced inspections, but if they
know you well they probablywon‘t
due that."

to doing “anything they can to pre-

tance of delegating responsibility

the rent and signing the related pa-

McKibbin spoke aboutthe legal
implications of leases. She agreed
that students are often more con-
corned wrth ﬁnding a location and
deciding whom they willlive with.
But she hoped that “when they get

Many students seem attracted to
nonrcollege-owned offrcrimpus
housing. because they were. in
Gosselink‘s words. ”no longer un-
der the college’s jurisdiction“ and
were “out on their own." Brad
Schell. a senior living at 932 Park
Apartment 9, explained that he was
“not particularly happy with dorm
housing." He
felt that the
“dorms were
not well-
heated." Hav-

wanted more
independence
and privacy
than the dorm
afforded, and
he discovered
that he could
save about a

in his apartment. In addition, he
believes he has “one of the best
landlords."

has a single which allows her a lot
of privacy and freedom that she
didn’tgetin Norrislastyear. Sheis
disappointed, however, that there
“are notes many people aroundv as
in the dorms nor the study breaks.

Bill Zucreher. who also lives in
Spanish House, said that the lan-
guage house does not appear to
fulfill its function to a great degree.
He is a chemistry major and ex-
plained that only a few of the nine
inhabitants speak Spanish well.
Spanish isoccasionally spoken, and
professors are invited over to enjoy
a Spanish meal from time to time.
With regard to space, he shares a
room but”therooms are biggerand
better than Norris." He explained
that shopping was done on an in~
dividual basis and that the main
problem was with people not wash-
ing the dishes.

Jillian Kong, a senior living at
1008 Park Street, feels that living
off-campus is “totally different"
than living in Read Hall last year.
“It’srcally comforting to haveyour
own kitchen and living room," she
said. She did not recommend live
ing off-campus fornon-uppcrclass
students, however, since they still
would not have established neces-
sary “ties towho visits you and who
you Visit."

As a sophomore, Kong lived in
China House. She said she enjoyed
the students and also Zhengguo
Zhang, the visiting Chinese pro-
fessor that year. She felt meeting
him and having occasional special
meals “was really groovy." Aside
from such cultural experiences.
however, she contends that “l n
guage houses are a total farce." In
regard to the seven houses which
Grinnell is looking into having as
language houses next year, she
statedthat“tcrestrictprojecthouses
is to emphasize that farce.”
