College Announces $2.2 Mil Goodnow Renovation

RINNELL College has
launched a $2.2 million
ftmd-misingefforttoreclaim

the campus’ oldest building, Goodnow
Halt. Grunt Gale, professor emeritus of
physics, isthehonorary chaitof thedrive,

“We aredelighted that he has once
againagrccdlohclp thecollegeinrocalh
mg themany yearsof his own association
with Goodnow Hall, Professor Gale
brings an authentic interest and enthuse
astn to the task of generau'ng support for
thcrenewal ofa buildingsocentral tothe
entire history of the college,“ says Grinr
nell President Pamela Ferguson.

Goodnow Hall was the first new
buildingconstructod ontthrinnellcamr
pus arter Ihecyclone of 1882. Occupied
in 1887,itwas firstuscdastl library, then
a Iabomtery. it later housed the depart-
ments of mathematics, astronomy, and
physics.

Goodnow has wen little use since
thepsychologydepamnentmovcdoutin
1987. The building was officially closed
in 1992. Gale had a semnd-ﬂoor othce
and taughtirtGoodnow from1928—1954,
until Bowen Hall of Science opened.

It’s important that the fund-raising
effort be successful, Gale says.
“Goodnow is the only tie, really, to the
original college campus. If Goodnow
weredemolished, there wouldn‘tbe any
connection to thepostcyclone days. It’s
very imponant to have a connection to
the pasL especially dnee we’ll be cel-

ebrating our Sesquieentennial soon. if
we didn't have Go<xlnow, we wouldn’t
have anything to celebrate," Gale says,

Grinnell will commemorate its
150m anniversary in 1996. Goodnow

nial logo.

President Ferguson agrees with
Gale, “it's imponant to renovate
Goodnow because 1t has played an inte-
gral role in Grinnell‘s history. It will be
wonderful ID have the building done in
time for the Sesqutcentenniztl," she says.
“i heartily commend the Boarrl of Trust-
cos foritsdeciston torenovateGoodnow
Hall. As the oldest existing building on
campus. it reﬂects botlt the historical
growth of the college and an 1mponant
facet of Atnerican architecture.”

Construction Will begin in March
1994, and the building is expected to be
ready foroccupancy in March 1995, says
Waldo Walker, vice—president for col-
lcgc services and director of facilities
management

Some of the work that will be done
includes installing an elevator, remodelv
ing thcinterior,andrtepatring theexterior
masonry.

In most aspects, the project is a
renovation project-not a restomtton
project because many of the building’s
original features already have been re
moved in previous renovation projects.

ously, the restroom walls are not t
suitable forum to discuss the legality
morality, or reality of homosexual-
ity. When asked if he felt he was
censoring the anti-gay opinions Just
as they attempt to censor him, Ihrig
added: “if the people who feel com-
pelled to write such things in the
bathroom of Burling feel that they

be it. But their actions, and the ac—
tions ofmtllions ofothers, forced me
to censor my speech and actions out
of fear for too long."
