See john. See John run. see John win.

Seems prerrysimple, bur rhar’s jusr how easy
John Aerni '01 makes it look. Like a kid's
srorybook, rhe recap of every race this year
ends the same: John Aerni comes in ﬁrst.

The story was the same at Gtinncll’s an-
nual Les Duke Invitational. Aerni won the
event with a time of 26:17.

“ourplan was ro ler John go, and nor make
him pack," Coach Will Freeman said. “He
conrinues ro improve and showed his menral
toughness to break the ﬁeld in the middle of
the race with a 9:55 twormiie split. I think
right now he is one of the best Division III
runners in the nation.”

The resr otrhe Pioneer crossacounrry squad
were no slouches eirher. Dan Madigan '00 and
Noah Lawrence '02 clocked times of 27.28
and 27:30 to ﬁnish 14th and 15th. Rob Park
’01, still battling asthma, ﬁnished 20th with
a time of 27:48 Carroll Cottingham '03

of28'16.
