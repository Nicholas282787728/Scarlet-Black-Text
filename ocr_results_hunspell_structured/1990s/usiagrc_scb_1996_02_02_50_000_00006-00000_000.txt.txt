THE STATE OF NATIVE AMERICA

504 Years of Indigenous Resistance

by Bruce Friedrich

LeAnne Howe Addresses Grinnell

The Convocation Speaker
for last week was Le Anne
Howe, a Choctaw woman from
Oklahoma, Ms. Howe has been
engaged in political struggles
for Native American rights for
many years, and she addressed
our campus three times: first,
she offered a moving reading
based on a short fiction work
titled “They Painted the Town
Red" and spoke about the ace
tual situation which inspired
this story; at convocation, she
spoke about “The State of Na-
tive America: Economically,
Politically, and Socially"; fi-
nally, she sat with a few stue
dents and chatted about re,
sources for Native Americans,
writings by Native Americans
and about Native American
experience, and genially an,
swered whatever questions.

Ms. Howe began by recount-
ing some of her experiences.
She is a member of the Choctaw
nation, the fourth largest in»
digenous nation in the United
States.

Ms. Howe writes fiction, she
explained, “to make a state-
ment." She began her mlk by
reading a short piece titled
“They Painted the Town Red."
The reading was riveting,

Grinnell and Native America

During her first talk, LeAnne
Howe asked at one point how
many of us had studied any-
thing about Native Americans
in college. Not one person
raised their hand. I was a bit
surprised, but not really. Nae
tive Americans represent one
ofthe most exploited and least
discussed groups of people in
the country. I assume this is
because talking about treat
ment of Native Americans
would look so awful for the
white men who have tradi-
tionally written the textbooks
and determined “history.”

beautiful, sublime, and then
frightful. She described the
rape, by the Choctaw chief, of
one of his people. The chief
had been beautiful, strong,

eloquent. He was educated at I»

Dartmouth and then Harvard
Law School.

He became power hungry
and mean; he embezzled the
Nation’s money and treated
the people with disdain, With
his psychological fall came a
physical fall: he got [at and
disgusting. He continued to
delude himself that he was
“for the Nation," which is even
more tragic. The rape episode
is graphic, disgusting, terrify—
ing, and real. It seems to be a
metaphor for what is happen,
ing to Native Americans
around the world.

She then related the situa
tion which inspired the story,
the situation with her tribal
chief and the infighting of the
Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma.
She wrote the story, as all her
stories, to make a point, to
add to the discussion.

Ms. Howe then related per,
