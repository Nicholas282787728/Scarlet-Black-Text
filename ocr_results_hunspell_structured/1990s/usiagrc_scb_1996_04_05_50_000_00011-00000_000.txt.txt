While most of the college stu—
dents in Florida were seeking fun in
the sun Over spring break, the otin.
nell College men’s tennissquad used
their srtrir for more serious maiters.
The Pioneers faced four opponents
overa three—tlayspan, improving both
endurance and confidence for the
latc»scason matches. The Pioneers
(3—6) tallied a 1—3 rccoid during the
trip, defeating Onondaga but ialling
toWestAlabatna,Sl<idmote and \th—
lalnt-ite

Since Muii Sherdil and Frank
Davis, No. l and No 5 respectively
in singles, were tinable to make the
trip, the Pioneers were shorthandcd
from the start, Compounding the
prohlem, each member of the resin
was forced to step up their game and
play at higher seeds than their usual
rankings. Despite these initial dim.
culties, the Pioneers still managed
post some impressive pertormances
against tough competition. Also,
the experience against the strong op-
ponents should improve the team.
“As a whole, all the players are going
to benefit trorn changes when they
move back down," remarked Coach
Andy Hamilton.

Against Willamette the Pioneers
fell by the score 6—1, but the match
was much closer than the score indi—
cates. Josh Tepfer and Themios Car—
abas both lost nail bitets. Wagner
pulled off the lone outright victory
with a 7—6 (8—6), 6—3 (7—3) Win. After

\Vest Alabama is a top—20 Div. 11
team while Sktdmote is 3lst overall
in Div. III, Once again, \Vagner
stepped up his play as the only Pio—
neer to force his opponent to three
sets against Skidrnore. "Wagner was
by far the most consistent playerdur-
mg the week," said Hamilton. "I'm
very pleased tvrth his progress.”

With their run through Florida
and a good week of rest completed,
the Pioneers now face more chal—
lenges this weekend, Grinnell will
be at full strength when it takes on
nationally—ranked Midwest Confer—
ence foe Ripon this Friday at Ripon.
Coach Hamilton‘s goal is to steal
sotne points from a highly ranked
opponent. A good performance
would give the Pioneers momentum
as they follow with matches on Sat—
urday against Lawrence.
