Don’t Ask Me, I’m Just A Girl Our World According to Business Today

 

BY LIZZ WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

Well, it has been a semester. And a
year for that matter, too. And be-
cause Kurt gave me the idea on
Thursday night, I’ve decided to do
some reﬂections (though I'd much

rather be watching the Cure in Chis '

cage)...
January— It was cold, Moved itttoa
house and of the poison (OOPS. I
mean meal) plan. Woo Hoo. But,
wait... Where 's my MTV?
February— Still cold. I hate
Valentines Day. Why did 1 come
back to school? Again, where'slmy
MTV.7 l
March- There’s my MTV! Cold,
slushy. Spring Break in San Frans
cisco. I heart San Francisco, but
deﬁnitely not Stanford. Too bad that
I stayed at Stanford. I want to live
by the ocean. Grinnell has lots o’
money why don 't we have an ocean?
Why don't we move Grinnell to the
ocean? By San Francisco? 0r
Casablanca? 0r Ocean City, Mary-
land? Dr Chicago?
Aprll- Papers Papers Papers : Why
didn t [stay with Biology? My name
is Lizz Westmart and I am ach'cted
to the Absolutely Fabulous virtual
Home Shopping Game on the Come
edy Central Website. But I got the
highest score on Wednesday! The
snow is melting but I can’t go out-
side anymore because I have to write
three papers this week and next week
and the week after that and the week
pﬁg that... _, >
pets : the
g "Up All
Night, SleepAll Dayi " And then, its
oven 0/ course, I didn't know what
to talk to my friends about if] wasn 'l
complaining about my work. And
then... Graduation. The weekend
everyone gets booty The weekend
myfrierlds wentaway. Well, at least
they get to move to the ocean.
Junc- Saw my little brother gradu-
ate high school. It was quite painful
to be back in the halls that make my

nightmares. Got to see all of tlte
people [had spertt the past two years
trying to forget. And my parents
made me promise that I couldn‘t be
mean Darrtttit. Decided not to go
back to Gl'innellforthe sllrnnteraltd,
instead, work for The Man. Yes, I
sacriﬁced my principles for$850 an
hollr. Yes, I'm still guilty,
Wisconsin's Welfare Reform Pto-
grarn is a very, very, very, very bad
idea

July- Still working for The Man
keeping people down. Quitsrnoking,
Got stuck in a tornado on my way
back from visiting Gr-inneli this sum
met: I had a cigarette that day.
Auguste Back to school is actually
rtot, as advertised, back to cool. I
think someone should inform tlte
malls next year,

Septembet- The Gtt'rld begins and
I'm not talking about MTV and Eric
Nils.

Octoberr Fall Break in San Frans
cisco. My friends that now live by
the ocean seem like adults to me.
Being an adult, actually, doesn't
seem that bad Again, why don’t we
live by the ocean? Why don 't we
have mountains? Why don't we have
a lot of tntet-esttttg things to look at
and places to go? Why don 'l we (in
sert everything else that SF has and
Grillnell does not). .7

November I live at the library in
my spot by the window that I sit in
EVERY SINGLE DAY. Infact, I’m
going to use this column to express
my discontent at the people who
sometimes sit there. It is you who
keep me from being able to do my
work because i can only work in MY
CHAIR. You know who yoll are be
cause rrly name is oh the desk and
yours is not. Do not sit in my spot.
You people that only go to Hurling
irl the last weeks of the semesterm'e
taking the favorite seats of those of
its who live there. Obviously, you
people do ttot understand library ell:
quelte. We know you don ’l becattse
we know everyone that hangs ottt at
Burling because we are there seven
days a week. My seat, not yours. And
the some respect should be shown for

_Kat'l' and Brian, my libr-anr buddies.

You're lucky I haven ’l thrown your,
books oﬁ‘ the ledge down onto the
ﬁrstﬂoar

Decembcr- I doll ’t really know what
else to say. It has been a year, Irhas
been a semeslet: I wish [didn't have
to write five billion pages this week
end. But once again, 1 will soon be
done, home, and comatose an my
couch watching Comedy Central
with my dog. I think the best part
about being home is that I’m not at
Grinnell.

What better evidence of the beneﬁts
of the Global Economy than the
Business Totlaymagazine sent to our
mailboxes?

The excess reams of colorful paper
in the world can be used [0 rld cor-
porations OfthIIbIIIIOnrdOIIllrprOﬁl
mllrglns. Business Today enlight-
ened Grinncllians on the business op
portunities in Brazil. when: we can
effectively exlernallzc those pesky
societal costs: livmg wages and en-
vll‘onmenlal Standards. New I know
that “Free Trade," ”Global Markets"
and “Interdependence" ale really
uniting the world's people, when
before I thought that these were
mcrcly lhc lechnoctalic \vct dreams
of corporate libertarians.

I used to think that “emerging mar~
kets" was a code word for f‘good
place to externalize costs." Now I
know better Now I know that Bras
2” and India and Guatemala are "dcs
veloplng." Ofcourse, “developing"
just means that poor foreigners don't
want choice of employment besides

sweulfaclory jobs, untl their govern-
ments Wlll exempt our Companies
from any accountablllly for abusing
their own pcoplc.

Here's the best part: we Grinncll
students didn't even have [0 ask for
subscriptions. We can be educated
in the mevlmblhly of Corporate
Amcrlczl without going through lhc
effort of thinking about [he censor
quences ofsuch a future. Thankfully,
these magazines don't have to CIlSr
lingulsh themselves as advertising or
news. After all, in the Global
Economy, traditional burners of dis-
tinctlvencss are lrl'clcvanl— remem-
ber, we’re all in lhls together,

My parents sllll aren’t enlightened
on Globalization. They still seem to
think that economic competition is
‘guod” or something, As lf Adam
Smith would have disapproved of
markets dominated by corporate
megalopolies, right! They also doubt
the effectiveness of “corporate te-
sponslbiltty." They say that no male
ter how pious corporations are, they
are only constrained by the imperar
lives ofacomputerized global flm‘lk
eizll system which requlres corpora

llonS lo opefalc us Cullhloal as pos-
sible. My (lad Sflld that no mullet
how good [hey are, llkc Levis Co
orcveu McDolllllds, you can‘t be so-
clally responsible and survive In the
global markcl. Mall, my pllrcnls are
so slodgy, Why can't they just ace
ccpl Globaliralion and stop being so
protectionist?

My little sister IS a dil’lcrcnl story,
though. She‘s only 8 years old and
already identifies vcry slmngly wllll
bland names. unllkcwllctl I was that
age and all I was llllcrestcd in was
frlcnds, food, and lull. Then again,
she has grown up watching “Chute

No problem now. Our gcllcmtlon

BY IVY CHANG

Iwas standing outside Quad when
I overheard them. They were by
themselves. Two boys having a pri-
vate conversation I wasn't trying to
overheat but couldn’t help listening
[0.

they hang up their respective coats,
”...I wouldn't want another student
on the Presidential Selection Come
millce anyways...l wouldn’t want
any of the freaks here representing
me,,.,”

hmm.,.

One turns and says to the other as

Freaks, huh?

I {town without even thinking
about it, the way I always do ifsomc;
thing bothers me. Automatic roller
tion. I had heard that one before;
the hate and disgust and intolerance
for everything he was not. In that
moment, I realized that for all the
thousands of miles I had traveled in
order to go to college out-of—slalc, I
might as well have stayed in my
small, conservative, predominately
Whlte, upper middlerclass suburb.

Why? I wondered. Why would you
come to Grlnnell ifyou felt that wzly
about the majority ofthe school? At
least that’s who I’m assuming he was
referring to when he mentioned “the
freaks."

But maybe I shouldn’t assume.
Maybe he only. meant select
“freaks." The ones who were trying
to cause all those problems by be
ing so outrageous as to expect some
representation on the committee that
was only in charge of choosing the
next president of the college they
were paying beaucoup bucks to at-
tcnd, after all. The nerve of those

crazy kids (I mean freaks).

If they (the freaks) don‘t represent
you (a nollrfreak), why don't you
find someone who docs represent
you? I mean, when you look at it, it's
really the same situation, except that
you‘re automatically guaranteed that
your malnstream vlews Wlll be rep-
resented. I \vouldn'l spend too many
sleepless nights worrying about that,
The mainstream view is always reps
resented. Have you ever considered
[hilt maybe the way you feel about
“freaks" representing you |S the same
way they feel about Erin Cllildrcss
representing them?

You must understand that and you
must also understand that many
people seek oul Gnnnell because
they believe that it‘s gomg to be a
refuge from the maltlstrcanrdomb
hated world Then they come here
and it‘s a shock for them to realize
that Grlllncll is a busmcss headed by
the trustees who run the school from
the world of the mainstream and it's
really all just a lbcndc alter- zlll.

I was one otthose people. I behcved
that Grltmell was unique and that it

day, there’s an advertisement (or
news, I'm not sure) fur a National
Conference, “Business Tomorrow".
We should start a Grinnell van pool
to attend. I never knew that going
into business meant that I had to be
in a corporation, But all the confers
cllcc sponsors (such as Dow Chemir
cal, IBM, and Ford Motor) are mule
llnzlllonal corporations. Iliad these
stupid dreams before that I could
make good money Wlth a small, lo—
cal ﬁrm producing good products and
paying good wages,

Thank God I woke up to the real-
lly: ll's better to struggle up a core
poralc lllddct, work a jobl don’t hate,
producing computers for the top 5%
of the world. explomng 50% of the
world, and making big bucks for
shareholders who wouldn't hesitate
to speculate me out of aj‘ob. Even
better, I could work for a consulting
firm to help corporations exploit 50%
of the world, work jobs they don’t
hate. and make big bucks for share-
holders who wouldn‘t hesitate to
speculate them out ofajob, Thanks
In Business Today, I’ve got my ca-
reer priorities straight,

attracted a certain type of person. I
assumed that I could come here to
the middle of Iowa away from the
football players (I don’t mean to ste-
‘reotype, but in this case it really was
true) who ran my high school, away
from the people whose narrow mlnds
would never be opened, away from
all the “name" schools that were busy
playing the ranking game, only to
find that all of it is here at Grinnell
too,

That is what the two boys showed
me with their frankness, for which I
thank them, because it was high time
I realized, High time I realized that
whether I’m at Hart High School or
Grlnncll College or anywhere else,
there are always going to be the same
people. That’s something you don‘t
ever get away from. Grinnell may be
one of the few places where the pro-
portions are invested, but don't
worry, these are the only four years'
out of your life during which you’ll
ever have to be troubled by that.

 

Tales From Another World

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

And there are questions of forgive
ness: who is worthy? who is worthy
to judge? ,

I am guilty ofso much, while oth-
ers are guilty of so much more and
others still of so much less.

Who amongst us has not lasted of
death's blood? The juice of the toe
mate, the juice of the cow.

But I‘m not really talking about
these murderous transgressions.
What I‘m getting at are the crimes
we commit against each other. I am
speaking of sin; sin deﬁned as any
act not motivated by love, I am
speaking of the everyday America I
have come to know. I am talking
about you, I am revealing me.

To pillage the mind, to pillage the
body, can it be said that one is worse?

I have played with hearts and left
them cold to rediscover their beat.

Il-lave brought big men to tears wlth
quick jabs of my tongue,

I have stolen money and goods
from strangers and friends, from the
HY-VEE grocery and my parents’
money drawer.

I have lied to portray myself in a
better light and other times to push
someone else into shadows.

I have laughed at public disgrace.
I‘ve enjoyed Ricki Lake. When I
heard Richard leon had died, Isaid
“about time.”

It’s a cold world and I’ve done noth-
ing to warm it.

It’s my world and I act as lfto dis-
Own it

And who wtll deny mc forgiveness?

' I’ve done what millions have done,

“You're just a human being and hue
man bcmgs make mistakes.” We act
imperfectly and deny our perfect
selves. And lo Ihflt question of for
glveness, if we've done the act we
will forgive it If we understand what
lies behind it, we can forgive it. But
if it is u Cru’nc unthinkable to our
mlnds ol'llmlled experience we ask
that god do the forglving, We have
no desire lo be holy. We are satisﬁed
with our wretchcdness, we only seek
to keep our wickedness within cer-
lain boundaries, But the unthinkable
happens, and as we move through
time into the imagined glory of the
future, it happens more and more
often, and there musl be a response.
More sound than to kill Illcm all and
let god forgive lhcm. und then turn
and prlly that he forglves us. And
then: must be something we can do
besides condemn and turn away. We
are not Obllgzllcd to bc imperfect, we
are not limited as human beings As
humans we are the source of god,
religion is our creation designed to
spread the god-love, but now H has
become our most shameful excuse.

Godrlovc, to love the sinner more
than yourself, to feel communion
with all that is, to look upon ugliness
and see clear to its beauty, and I’ve
been told what nonsense this is, how
fruitless the polm of View, how to
strive for perfection is to stumble
from disappointment to disappoint-
mcnl, I’ve been told [hut around cv-
cry corner is horror awaiting, and
I’ve lived with those thoughts as my
guiding perspective and I've seen the
honors and I‘ve lived in fear, for fear.
but eventually I came to see that as
the fruitless path ofdisuppoinlmcnl.
I am not disappointed by the honors
of the world, because every horror
15 overcome. There IS nothing hor-
riblc enough to take away [he reality
of beauty in life I've learned that all
of life is ln reactions. and that when
horror is met with horror and hate
with hate and negativity with negar
llvlly there is but one future posslble.
As clicllc' as it is, lt is amazingly obs
vious that only love can conquer
hate, that universal joy can not be
uchlevcd unless ll ls strivcd for. And
as for forgiveness, there IS none willie
out the effort, there is anuclge but
the future walling. there is no qucss
lion lflhcrc is love.

Letter to the Editor

I um writing to discuss some infor-
malion that [just became aware of
about the renovation andponstruc
tlon ofthe FlueArts building. I think
that the student body |S under the line
presslon that the construction Wlll
solve certain problems wtthin lhc
mustc‘ department regarding space.
Although the new construction does
solve many space problems. [he con-
struction of the Fine Arts building
does not include a concert llclll

Originally, the impetus for the reno-
vation and construcllon of the Fine
Arts building was the need for a re-
placement for Rubens Thcalrc. Be-
cause of budget constraints and [he
limited viston of out truslccs, lhlS rc-
plaeemeut is not being constructed,
In addition, the new Flue Arts bulld-
ing wlll not include aconccrl hall that
would htlvc accommodated publlc
concerts and mcl the needs of Grin-
ncll music groups such as the Or-
chestra and the Grinnell Singers. You
might be Sﬂylng to yourself right
now. how does this effect my life at
Grinncll? Well, I will give you a
couple ofexumples. While worklng
at the Mingus Big Band Concert at
Herrick, Iwas forced to turn people
away because wc had run out of
room, Many students were nol happy
WHII this, undjuslly so. In addition,
when I was a ﬁrst your stlldcnl. Tracy
Chapman came to campus and per-
formed in the Hams ccnlel In order
to lcl more pnople enjoy the concert,
people salon the floor and still only
half the student body was zlllowcd
into lhc concert.

Grrnnell is very proud (and often
mentions it when recruiting) that slus

to the editor

dents are able to enjoy a variety of
renowned mustcmus lhul are brought
to campus such as Tracy Chapman,
Chanticleer. and The Mingus Big
Band WhlIe these concerts may be
free (you don't have to puy at the
door), not everyone may enjoy these
concerts. Hot-tick only seals about
400500 pcoplc. This means that
whcll popular groups come to cum-
pus ul least 800 students are re-
stricted from attending and enjoying
what they paid form their lulIlOlI and
studclll activity fees. Why don‘t they
play in Hams or Dtlrhy'l Wcll, ncir
that Harris not Darby is a cornferb
able or ucousllczllly pleasing place
for concerts, Nevertheless. Hulris
and Darby are used as performing
space for groups better suited to [he
space and ucoustlcs of a concert hall.
For example, the orchcsll‘zl now
practices in the south lounge of the
Forum and performs ill the Hur 's
Ccnlcl because [he stage at Herrick
is too small.

Although a Recital hull ls lucludcd
in tho new Conslrllcliull of the Fine
Arts bulldlng. this hall will not solve
these problems. The ball will only
seat 350 people and Is not SLIllCd to
large muslc groups or Wldely nt-
lcnded music events Il W true lllal
the College does bring III a variety
ofllluslc groups, bul as lllc Mingus
Byg Baud Conccrl demonstrates.
they do not have the facilities to ac»
colunlodatc lllcsc groups In addi-
tion, large ensembles, such as the
Gl'lnncll Orchcsuu. \vlll not be able
l0 take full advantage of IIIC llcw

‘Fute Arts building. Many students

believe that the Fine Arts construe»

. tion will solve the problem of inad-

equate space for larger musical as
well as theater productions. Well, I
hate to say it, but many people may
be disappointed, I implied earlier that
the trustees acted with limited vision
when they imposed large budget con»
slraints in the fcnovulion of the Fine
Arts budding. Wllhln this 22 mil»
lion-dollar project, they could have
easily included a few million more
for a concert hall or main stage where
boll: theater productions and music
events could occur. In addition, the
nature of the Fine Arts construction
does not allow for further addillons
to the building. Herrick will continue
indefinitely as the main stage for
large groups, and Darby and Harris
will continue as inadequate alternate
(iVCS for groups that Herrick cannot
accommodate As a suggestion to
solve this problcm, maybe Grinnell
Collcgc. along with the Grinnell
community and the public schools,
should look Into building a concert
hall or main stage that can handle a
rclallvclylarge numberofpeople and
that includes a Stage that can become
module large theatre and music pror
duclious,
