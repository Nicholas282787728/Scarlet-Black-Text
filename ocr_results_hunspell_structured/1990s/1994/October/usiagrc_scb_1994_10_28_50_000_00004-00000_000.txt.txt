ARK yourcalcndar: Habi—
tat for Humanity is in
more dire need of volun-
teers than ever and the days to help
out are tomorrow and next Saturday,
November 5.

Because the house that Habitat
is working on is behind schedule. the
organization is asking the Grinnell
community for help. “We have an
immediate need for volunteers," said
Habitat co—coordinator Alice Gates.

Habitat is organizing an all-carn-
pus work day for next Saturday, but
volunteers are needed at any time. All

the unified government, eastern
women have lost many of their
rights. McIntyre said that the
governmenthas even gone so far
as to encourage women to stay in
the home with the intention of
opening jobs for men.

This policy appears to be in
stark opposition to the practice
of shortening the work week.

cnisade for the homeless and less
fortunate at Carthage College in
Kenosha, Wisconsin.

At Carthage. Mann started an
outreach program that became a
school»wide project that included
Project Pride and Identity, a
mentoring program in which he and
other college students worked with
sevenAfrioanAmerican malcstodcal
with issues facing young men.

“1 lot of them were interested in
college and asked how I managed to
make it out of Chicago," he said. “I
let them know I didn't grow up an

Mann uansfened to Grinnell this
year. He is currently Vice-spokes-
man for Concerned Black Studean

painting and other jobs that needtobe
completed before winter sets in.

Work willbegin at9:00a.m.and
volunteers can stay for two-hour
shifts, although they are more than
welcome to stay at the site longer.
Transportation will be provided.

The house is located at 434

Such contradictions. however,
are an inherent part of the transia
tional state of such a new gov-
ernment. The end results ofboth
programs do, in final analysis,
provide jobs to an employment-
starved nation.

“These arejust problems the
new government will have to
work out," said McIntyre.

new lecture series called Pathfinder
that will bring a different speaker to
the BCC each month,

He is also part of the Native
American Interest Group and a mem4

Choir.

At the moment, Mann has no
plans to start any new programs at
Grinnell like he did in high school or
at Carthage

“There are already a lot of good
programs here." he said.

He is interested, he admitted, in
looking at issues dealing with inner-
cities and minorities and with bring—
ing speakers to Grinnell to talk about
those issues.

“We don‘ t havejust a problem in
our cities," he said. “It’s a crisis."
