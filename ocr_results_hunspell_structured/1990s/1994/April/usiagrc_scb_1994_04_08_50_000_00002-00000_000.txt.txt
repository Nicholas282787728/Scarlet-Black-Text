reason for the six week break this
year was that the energy situation
appeared to be much more serious
than it was. . He believed that if
the energy situation was as mild as
next year, there was no reason for

feminist theory which incudes de-
ceiving transcultural generalities.
Her Black Feminist Thought brings
together a broad range of African-
American women’s echrience,
knowledge, and ideas such as the
blues, fiction, and life stories as a
basis for black feminist thought and
theory. She also examines the femi-
nist perspective on sexuality with
respect to black women.

Collins feels that examining
black women’s experiences and
knowledge in black feminist
thought is useful on a large scale,
socially. politically.and intellec-
tually. She wrote in thejournal,
Gender & Society, “I think that
one major contributions of the
discussion of Afrocentrism genr
erally,and black feministthought
in particular, is that it validates
the significance of alternative
world views, not just for Afri-
can-American women and other
historically suppressed groups,
but for larger intellectual and
political communities searching
for new ways of grappling with
difference.“
