HE Air Force recently
announced plans to
discontinue ROTC at

eight universities and colr
leges.Grinnellincluded. The
minimum required out-put of
fifteen officers had not been
met at these schools. The
Air Force maintains that this
is due to the lack of student
interest and denied that the
Air Force is under pressure
from anti-war groups or fac-
ulty members.

80 years ago
in the S &B...

T the Senior meeting
Tuesday evening, it
was decided that the

class should present its own
play during Commencement
week. . , .

In other years, each class
has given its own play, and as
1914 has actors of more than
usual ability, the event this
spring should be up to the high
standards set by former
classes.

GA Presidential and Vice
S Presidential elections for
1994795 were held last
Monday with a runoffon Tuesday.
Junior Vice Presidential candidate
lamb Willig beatjurtiorsNancy Yirlg
andFl-ames Menezes fortheposition.
Willig is “very excited about
gettingstaned.”andwillbegin work
on SGA projects this semester and

 

Horton, Wﬂlig Win SGA elections

continue this summer while doing
physics research in Grinnell.

”l'he original Presidential election
was too close to call (46% sophomore
Aaron Fate; 42% current Vim President
junior Monica Horton: 9% write-in can-
didale junior John Haller), making a
Tuesday runoff election necessary.
Halon was the evcnulal winner, nar-
rowly defeatingFale by l7votes. “I was
cenainlygladthatIhadasecondchance
lode somelastminule campaigning [for

the nut—om," commented Horton. “I
am very excited that [won the election.

POWERS from page 1

“l’ve written 8 books and l4
articles. I have at least one major
articleinallthemajorjournalsin my
field and several in major journals
outside my ﬁeld . . . and it doesn't
make any difference. As faras [can
tell. in academia today, all hiring
decisions are made on the basis of
race and gender."

To beat affirmative action.
Powers said “i think that it’s a
very good idea for any white male
students who are thinking of go-
ing to grad school to change their
names to something Hispanic or
Native American ,, something
very ethnic sounding,” He added
that he is planning to change his
name to Juan Perez so that he
will qualify as a minority under
affirmative action programs.

to keep Powers at Grinnell was
ambivalent. “At this point, our
organization can’t do anything,"
explained Amy Luftig, a leader
in the efforts to keep Powers.

“It’s too late in the year, and
they'renotgoingtolistentousat
this point. What we're going to
do next year is try to inﬂuence
what kind of position they‘re
going to make next year. . . at
that point, who knows where
Powers will be?”

“I think it’s pretty futile to
keep pushing,” Luftig added.
“It‘djust be a lot of unnecessary
noise and ruckus.“

1n reaction to Powers' alle-
gations ofdiscrimination through
affirmative action, Gareth Fisher,
another leader in the student or-
ganization, explained “I don‘t
think we can be one hundred per-
cent sure that that‘s the case .. .
I don't think it's fair for me to
speculate on that."

publications from almost anywhere on

campus. This creates more flexibility
between writers andeditors since writers
can easily drop offa story at any time
instead of waiting for someone Io be at
the Student Publications building.

The Scarlel & Blackhas also cre-
ated a link to the world via the new
network hookup. Any Macintosh user
on the network can deposit a document
on what is called the
8&3 FILE SERVER. The procedure
is: 1) access Chooser from the Apple
Menu in the upper rightrhand comer of
the screen; 2) solar AppleShare; 3) se-
lect the AppleTalk zone SCIENCE; A)
select 5&1} Machine: 5) log on as a
Guest. Once the 5&1; FILE SERVER
hasbeen openeddroptheﬁleinthe
IN BOX.

If you have any problems or ques-
tions, vax [SANDS]. The Scarlet &
Black hopes this new linktothe commu
nity will provide a greater channel of
communicationbetween Lhecampusand
its newspaper.
