To the Edilrr.

As chairperson of the Religious Studies Depanment, I feel a responsibility to
respond to last week’s article in the 5&8 regarding the hiring process in our
depanmenL The article claimed that our department had written a job description
for Profem Sawada's replacement so as to prevent Professor John Powers from
being a strong contender for the position. However, the fact is that the position
advertised in 1989—d1e one for which Prof. Sawada was hiretHs virtually identical
with the one being uwd to seek her replacement In both cases the job description
satedulat‘meapphcant‘spnmaryn'ainingshouldbeinComparativeReligionswith
an emptmis on Japan and China”

John came to Grinnell College as my replacement during my leave year 1992-
93. OnApril 16, 1993,me. Sawadarequesled aleave ofabsence aﬁerroceivinga
fellowship from theJapan Foundation to dorescarch in Japan for one year. At that
pointitwasloolaletodoasearchtorcplmehcr. chcltfonunalerhatwecouldkeep
John for one more year. He has been, we believe, an excellent teacher who has
whtributed valuable courses to our depanment in his areas ofspecialization.

Profemor Howard Burklc and I have spoken at length with John and I believe
that the misunderstanding has been cleared up. Silence may be golden, but then: are
times when dialogue is essential for understanding.

To the Editor:

If Jon Cook’s representation of John Powers' views on affirmative
action are indeed accurate, then, sadly, I ﬁnd Mr. Powers to not be qualiﬁed
to live and work in the Grinnell College community.

1 have no knowledge of his teaching ability, skills, and experience,
which seem impressive in the article, nor do I disagree with his right to
express his opinion on affirmative action. I do, however, think his remarks
in the S&B were very immature and unprofessional, and did not promote a
spirit of unity and multi-culturalism, a goal to which I hope any Grinnell
professor would strive.

lspeak only of the quote in which Mr. Powers suggests that white males
change their names to “Juan Perez.” Not only is this remark inflammatory,
but under many codes, it could be considered a racial slur. I can only hope
that Mr, Powers was caught up in the heat ofangerwhen he said this, and that
thiswill bealesson to him to think before hespeaks. Ialso hope that someday
he will come to understand the true pain of discrimination based on race and/
or sex.

To the Editor.

I have intentionally waited a few days after the appearance of theanicle on Professor John Powers in hopes that I would
not need to speak out Alas,l have been disappointed by my colleagues both white ethnic males who dominate the faculty, and
the encroaching groupof while females. lndlvidualsofeilherpcrsuasion,despile theirassurancesofa belief in multiculutralism,
have notsoen ﬁt to take the time offhom course preparation, research and writing to speak out. And so the“Suballcm," the
“Other,” the “Minority," the “Personofﬂolor,” is left to speak for herself, as has so often been lhecase in history.

I Shall be brief and wish :0 make several thingsclear: I)Ido not intend todcbale my remarks; 2) I do not intend to address
this issuein writing again to Ithrinncll community,and 3) I do not hold anything personal against Prof. John Powers, whom
lhave found lobe adelightfuland engaging colleague when we worked togetheron the fomms on Multiculturalism and Popular
Culture His position, aspresented in the 5&8 article, actually serves as a wonderful heuristic text for this community. Thus,
I ask you to devote a few minutes to listening and teaming while 1, drawing from the traditions of Frederick Douglass and
Sojoumer Truth, teach and preach.

Prof. Powers’ response is notSurprising. It, in fact, typiﬁes what] havecome In view as “the white male syndrome." This
isacuriousatlhclion thatbcgauwilh Bakkeand crealcdlhenouon of‘reverscdiscrimlnation." ProfPowcrs asscnsthcexistcncc
of reverse discrimination here at Grinnell in his own bﬁind of affirmativeraction bashing~a strategy not so far removed from
Bakke, although almost 15 years separate the evenls.

His argument is that he is being discriminalm against because he is white. l-le funher asscns that he is also the victim of
genderbias since a woman would be viewcd as a there suitable candidate. His asessment is that race and gender are now the
Sole criteria f or hiring lather than qualiﬁwtions.

I believe Prof. Powers is conoct in assening that race and gender are criteria for hiring irregardless ofqualil‘lcations. His
argument, however. suggcsm that this is a change in policy as a result ofafflmtative action. This is where I disagree with him.
Race andgertderhavealwayrbeert the [maria Medirt hiringvexcepl theme/erred ”race" was white and ttnprr/mcdgtndtr
was male. Thus, twenty or thirty years ago Prof. Powers would have automatically bcen hired not because he was more
irnminenliy qualiﬁed, but simply because he was bom while and malo—andl take issue with his assumption that publications
equal excellence. There is a tremendous tunount ofmcdiocre scholarshippublished tnjoumals while cutting edge works are
rejeclrxi because they challenge the norms, as women and non»white scholars well know. I also disagoc \vlth hls displacement
thesis—that is,pcoplc olcoloraredisplacing traditional folk like him, One need only to glance around this campus and others
acrosstthnitedSlatcs toknow that it‘ every middleelass minority person werecountcd and the numbers thatched againstthosc
of the traditionally wlute (male) middle class, weconstitute asrnall percenmge of the group. We havedispltlccd no one, we have
displaced the ideology that cenaln privileges (education and employment) are binhrlgth if one is WhilC and mule.

The lesson Prof. Powers' comments present to us is that muluculuiralism, afftnnativc action and cultural diversity are a
direct challenge to the old style criteria. The bottom line being that people of color and worncrl (those who are geniuses and
those who are mediocre) have never been given opponunities, regardless of qua] iflcatlons. As Agatha Cllnstie would say, the
use of qualiﬁcations is a “red herring." It divens our attention from the real Issues.

The real issues for the Grinnell Community are these:

- Race is here to stay until we address the ways in which it has structured our social life and all our institutions.

- Whiteness likcall social races isacultural construction that is uncxamincd and so ingrained as to appear natural. In the

US, we assume everybody else has a race except whites. They just exist!

Raccand genderconlinue it) be factors in ourasscssmentof individuals, though theprcfcrcnccs for white and male being
the ideal are now challenged and weal-e moving away from them as lhedelermining criteria forprivilcgeand prestige.

Anytime individuals lose power, they automatically get angry and auack the most obvrous targets tamer than deal with
how institutions of power are constituted and might need to be changed.

Multiculutralism is not about course content; it is not about white clhnics talung cultural tours through the lives and
experiences of people of color so that the forrnercan feel good but never have to step outside the privileged status
created by White skin.

- Multiculturalism is about a reconﬁguration of power and key players.

What Prof. Powers has suddenly discovered is multiculturalism at work. What he has found is that his two chief assets
(whilentss and maleness) no longer have the same buying power as in the past And he is correct in asscning that there is some
privileging (long overdue) of “othemess” and ”femalencss". The reality of diverse populations of people living in close
proximity to each other and all wanting equal access to the strategic Cuiutml resources of education, healthcarc, employment
buying power, tixhnology,ctc. demands thatl do notpcrsonally take of fenseat Prof . Powers hatangul ng, though lam offended
by his trivializing of many histories of oppression by suggesting that all it takes to be a “minority” is to change one's names.
My identity cannot be reduced to the likes ofa label or a suit ofclothing that are switched or discarded when convenient And
for those of us who names (like McClaurin) give no indication of our m inonty status but whose appearance ZIIJCSLS to therapes
of black women under slavery, does he suggest that whim males don black face as a way of negotiating affirmative action?

I am movtxi by Prof. Power's anguish because I recognize (even though he doesn’t) that he has come face to face with the
contradictions of capitalism and democracy. While ethnits and especially while elllnlc men feel under siege notbocausc we as
minorities have displaced them but because the economic structure developed in this counny never intended for everyone under
its rubric Iooqually share thcwealth. We “minorities“ and women are not to blame, Ihesyslem of inequality inherent in acapilalist
mode ofproduction created the situation. We live in it and are subjcxt it) its whimsies just as Prof. Powers new realizes he is.

Let me suggest a solution for Dr. Powers. Apply for thejobs here or anyplace else and once ensconced, don ’t forget the
small exposure you had to what it feels like who on the margins. Use that cxperienccas a guide to working in institutions like
Grinuell to ensure an open system that genuinely evaluates people on the “content of the character," their intellectual
contributions or potential rather than by the color of their skin, their gender, religion or sexual preferences.

Unfonunatcly, given the public silence on the part of my colleagues and students to Dr. Powers’ comments, I fear we are
a long ways from such acommunity. lpersonally work tooducate people toward it in lYlyCthsses and my scholarship. Hopefully
the message will sink in. Meanwhile, Ichallengc all whitecthnlcs on this campus to ask themselves what are you personally
willing to give up to achieve multiculturalism?

in response to those who want to know what they will achieve, I say a new white Clill'llc self identity not predicated on
someone else’s subord'mation and a glimmer of your own humanity not haunted by slavery, imperial ism, racism, sexism,
homophobia, anqucmlusm or religious persecution.

That brand of humanity l have found more of ten among those who have had die experience of exclusion or marginality.
Sol see lhls situation as dle beginning ofa new journey for Prof. Powers, whether uthnncll or somewhere else. l Wlsil tum,
ml any others of the Grinncll community who travel the stune routc, safe passage,
