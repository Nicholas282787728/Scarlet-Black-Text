Wallace’s cutting edge In the Heart of America
dramatizes unseen side of ‘Desert Storm’conﬂict

By Jim Kropa

NGEREDby glitzy television
A coverage of the United States
involvement in the 1991 Per-
sian Gulf Conflict, lowa City poet
Naomi Wallace set out to find the real
story and wquestion multipleissues of
American identity in one work of
drama.

Herplaanthe HearlofAmen'ca,
performed ﬂiis weekend in Roberts
Theatre, dramatizes fear and cruelty
surrounding the conﬂict in a way that
would surprise most Americans.

“Bum the media and the govem-
menr kept ttre truth of what was hap
peningintheGulfWarfrom theAmeri-
can public in general," Wallace said.

This weekend‘s performances of

In the Heart grew out of Grinnell se-
nior Scott Ihr-ig’s idea to direct an
Open Space theatre production highr
lighting contemporary issues. Theater
professor Pip Gordon suggested the
play,and1hrigraised over$3000 from
groups and individuals on campus,

The production combines local
actors and designers with talents from
outside Grinnell, including lhrig.

bet."

Likewise Caspers. who met
Wallace just prior to this production.
was impressed by the play‘s honesty.
“It rips the coveroff and explores what
really happened to a few individuals,”
Caspers said ”Her research was not
what we all read in Newsweek and
Time magazines."

Wallace said that she didayearof
research forln the Heart. Some of her

mostunsettling informationcamefrom
interviews with approximately 250
imprisoned objectors who were in the
Persian Gulf during the 1991 conﬂict.
“A lot of them had seen torture
andmutilationof Iraqi soldiers—some-
thing that’s never been made public in
this country," said Wallace,
Furtherdiggingrevealed a United
Nations report that described “apoczrr
lyptic proportions of destruction" in

Iraq. Wallace commented, “Basically
Iraq is back to the stone age.” A
current United States embargo against
Iraq prevents medicine and humani-
tarian aid from reaching Iraqi citizens.

Herﬁndings are all Ihemore ironic
considering the images that most
Americans received during the con-
flict and still accept as the truth. Call-
ing CNN “the MTV of the war,”
Wallace Stated, “There’s Still the idea
in this country that it was a very quick
and clean war."

That irony intrigues Ihrig and
Caspers as well. “The Gulf War im
ages were very sterile; everything was
done almost like surgery,” Ihrig com-
mented. “Itwasn'taclinieal operation
that hundreds of thousands of people.
just like you and me, were killed”,
Caspers likened media coverageof the
conﬂict toarecorded reading of abook
in a car tape deck.

New Sense of History

Wallace‘sresearch didn’tstop with
theGulf War, and neitherdoes thescope
of the play, She found recurring themes
during United States military action in
VietNam,l’anama,Grenada1 thePersian
Gulf and other places.
