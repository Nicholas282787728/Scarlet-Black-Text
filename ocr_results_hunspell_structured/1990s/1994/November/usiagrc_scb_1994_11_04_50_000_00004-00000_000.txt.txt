Czech Open Space Production next weekend: Largo Desolato

By MARK HUANG
Staff Writer

HlLE atGrinnell,all of us
have felt the inﬂuence
ofsomeoneelse' s expec-

tations when making decisions on
how to lead our lives. This is the
prevalent theme in Largo Desalato, a
play being co-directed by senior
NathanBlantandjuniorBrigidRielly.
This play was written in 1984 by

also carries a serious message about
the human condition," says Rielly.
There is theadded bonus that itcomes
from the Czech Republic, a locale
that is not often heard from in drama.
“The views expressed are not like
Shakespeare, and they're not
American,"says Rielly. “One ofour
concerns was that this play is very
impomnt to the Czech people be-
cause of their political conditions,
both in the past and in the present."

However, because of the play’s con-
troversial political subject matter, it
was not performed there until six
years laterr

Both Brantand Rielly credit the
struggle for human identity and free-
dom of expression as one of the ma—
ior factors that made them choose
this play. They said that they wanted
to direct a play that is not commonly
producedincollege theatresarldwere
particularly attracted to this one be-
cause it has a universal meaning and
more than just an academic appeal.

“It‘s a very funny play, but it

Will it lose some power being per-
formed for an American audience
who can‘t understand the climate?
Both Rielly and Brant are conﬁdent
that it won’t, pointing out that. “the
power in the play lies in each person
applying it to their lives"

The play focuses on Professor
Leopold Nettles. played by senior
Zander Cannon He is a writer and

vious writing, Neules is in fear of
agents from the government coming
to punish him and he hides in his

people come into his home with pre»
conceived notions of who he is and

or not he is going to play these roles.
Rielly notes that what makes the play
so interesting is that it depicts this
struggle in the midst of all of these
other relationships, calling it an inter-
activestrtlggle. Both Brantanthielly
were also attracted to its writing style,
which offers up acombination of real-
istic moments and absurd humor,
One might consider it odd that
these two students are attempting to
direct a play together, but any ques
tions regarding this potential strain
on their friendship are all answered
with positive emotions and the ut-
most confidence in each other,
“Never having directed before, we
thought that working together would
be more productive,” says Rielly.
Brantisquicktoadd.“Twoheads
are better than one, If either of us
were directing this by ourselves, we
mightmiss something. Butwith two
different people, they carry different
views and angles about everything,
and l think we're able to cover it all.
We act as sounding boards for our
ideas, and then wework toassimilate
these ideas into the working produc-
tion. It's a growing experience in

communication."

No studentvdirected production
is without its won'ics, and both of
these directors held them as they be-
gan working, They felt very con—
ccmod about having an almost alla
student cast and production team and
wonderedwhctherornol,wilh classes
mixedin,evcrybodycould ﬁnish what
they needed to get done. “Sofarall of
our expectations have been ﬁlled,"
says Brant.

While this amount of work has
been daunting at times, they say
they've been well supported by the
cast and the crew. “The atmosphere
of an Open Space Production is so
much different than a Mainstage.
Having studentdirtxtors and design-
ers really changes the fecl of the
production,” claims Rielly. "Each
person has a personal touch, and the
responsibility and dedicationisamat-
ing, probably because it‘s theirs."

"We'd like to thank anyone and
everyone who has put any kind of
time into this,” Brant adds.

Largo Desolato is being per
formed at8:00 pmon November ll,
