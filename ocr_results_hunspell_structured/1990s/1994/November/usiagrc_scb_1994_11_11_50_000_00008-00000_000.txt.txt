The quiet, well-equipped classrooms
offer a private studying environment.
Studentscanwsilysettleintoaclass-
room, shut the door, and remain un-
disturbed all evening.

One student likes to study at
Steiner. He lives off-campus, and
stated that “it’s closer than the li-
brary, and it’s just as quiet here.“
Another studentlikes studying in the
classrooms in Steiner because she
“can listen to tapes on their
tapeplayers,

Carnegie is another building
some students choose over the li-
brary. Relatively quiet in the ever
nings. Carnegie has quitea few class-
rooms and lecture rooms in which
students can spread out their work
and not be bothered Said one stu-

cheers for Dining Services. This
is not ajoke. We were contacted
by CowlesSupervisorBarbShell,
who said something like, “Since
the next scheduled chicken patty
parmesan feeding frenzy was
Thanksgiving Day, we knew we
hadapowderkeg waiting to blow.
To avoid the imminent riot, we
decided to serve chicken patty
parmesan one more time this se-
mester.“ We salute you, Barb.
Served with the CPP is the
mostaciolli, as well as eggplant
parmesan and cheese ravioli,
which will be served on the ex~
perimental pasta bar. Maybe this
will replace the wok bar???

Thursday dinner: Roast beef
with gravy. Double check to
make sure that this is not two-
day-old roast turkey. The sea-
food fettuccini is a good dinner,
but that is about it Oh yeah, did
we forget that Dining Services
tries to pass over a flat, round
thing as a felafel patty’.l A lot of
people like the zucchini bread,
but that won’t save this meal. (at)

dent, “I like the big tables, and also
looking atall thepicturcson the walls
of the politicians who have visited
the campus."

Yet another alternative to the
library is Harris Center, which offers
students large, comfortable lounges
and is arguably one of the quietest
places on campus during the week.
One student named Han-is as her fa-
vorite place to study: “It‘s very com-
fortable, there‘ 5 neveranybody there.
it‘s peaceful and quiet, and I get free
pop sometimes,"

Still, the most common place
chosen over Burling is probably a
student’s room. Students often pre-
fer the many comforts of home. Said
onestudent,“lt’s familiar,it’sconve»
nienL I have all of my books right

there."

Another student, whose room-

mate named Harris as her favorite
refuge, likes to study in her room
because, “I can go out and bug my
roomatcs whenever I want a study
break." .
Other less common places were
listed as alternatives to Burling. One
student named Cowles as a place she
studies during breakfast“because if I
go back to my room I‘ll fall asleep."
This same studentlisted thePEC as a
place she studies “between classes
and practice and when I was heating
in the whirlpool.”

Onestudentsaid she likes tostudy
at Perkins. Why? “You don’thaveto
see anybody fi'om Grinnell," she said,
adding, “and unlimited coffee."
