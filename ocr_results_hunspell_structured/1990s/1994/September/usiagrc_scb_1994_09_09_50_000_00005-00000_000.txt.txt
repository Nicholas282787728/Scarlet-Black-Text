Drawing Room in the base-

ment of Burling Library portray all
types of womenishort, tall, fat, thin,
black, white. They‘re also all naked.
Through her images, photographer
Diane Rosenbium captures each
woman in her own environment, dis-
playing her own beauty. Rosenblum
dostroystheidealized. sexual image of
women so often promoted in the me-
dia. and, in essence, liberates women
to be proud of their natural bodies.

Beside the photographs are ex-
cerpts from the subjects‘ interviews
with Rosenblum. A deeper insight of
each photograph is gained by reading
how each woman voices her self-im-
age. One subject remarked that she
was glad that she was not a “classical
beauty", another was glad she has
grown old and was comfonable with
her own body, another wanted to have
her picture taken to “document" the
changes her body had made after her
pregnancy. Each woman is unique
and each woman is beautiful.

On campus yesterday to give a

lecture about her exhibit Rosenblum
explained the ideology behind her
work Oneof her goals is to “broaden
the perception" about women and
beauty, trying to “redefine" the image
that mietyhascreated. She explained
the difference between "nude" and
“naked“. Nude brings tominda"form
ofart",likeapersonon display. Onthc
other hand, naked refers to an indi»
vidualwidtoutclou-teson,freeofinhi-
bitions and disguise. It is for this
reason that Rosenblurn used “naked"
in her title. “Nudeanis usually erotic.
The nudity is for the viewer, who is
usually a man with clothes on.“

The photographs on display are
of friends and friends of friends. “At
ftrst,itwashard to findsubjectstopose
for the photographs,” she said. “Now
it’s a lot easier.“ Rosenblum told
stories about various experiences at
photo shoots. She told about photo
graphingthreeolderwomenoutsideof
a farmhouse, and a truck driving by.
The three women were entenained,
and were even more so when they
realized that the same truck kept driv-
ing by over and over again. In another

The Pelican Brief

Friday and Saturday at 8:30 p.m.,
North Lounge, Forum

Another best-selling-book
turned movie, this exciting, sus-
pensefulflickisaboutayounglaw
studentUuliaRobens)whodevel-
ops a theory about who ordered
the murders of two SupremeCourt
justices. Her revealing legal brief
is passed from her lover’s hands
into those of the FBI, and they ﬁnd
her theory uncomfortably close to
the truth. She must now run for
her life. Although the book is
deﬁnitely better, this movie por-
trays the action better than any
other movie based on one of
Johnathan Grisham‘s novels
(The Firm) I've seen.

Rocky Horror Picture
Show
Friday (118:00 p.m., Mac Field

Usually shown at midnight,
Grinnell breaks tradition with Lhis
musical cult classic, but it should
be fun out under the stars. Accord-
ing to SGA films chair, the non-
uaditional show time is due to the
Harris Party also scheduled for
midnight You make the connec»
tion. Rocky Horror Picture Show
is probably the oddest. most off-
Lhe~wall cult ﬁlms ever made.

The actual story is about a
dull young newlywed couple who
stumblesintoacastleinhabitedhy
weirdos from the planet
Transylvania. Among followers,
this spoof is the best ever,“a must»
see". At Grinnell, this is a guaran—
teed good time, complete with
viewers costumed as characters
such as the sweet transvestite.

The Three Musketeers

Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday
213:00p,m.,Harri: Cinema

“All forone and one iorall" is
the motto of this trio. An all-star
cast, including Keifer Sutherland.
brings this hero‘s story to life with
excitement and romance. Humor
similar to one of last year's on-
campus movies, Much Ado About
Nothing, spices this entertaining
and action-packed film, which
brings back the Medieval Euro-
pean era with ﬂair.
