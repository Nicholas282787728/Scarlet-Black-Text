Hosp—i—tele: quarantine yourself, spare the rest of us

By JULIE MICKENS
Staff Writer

Y who have health, have all.
They who aresiclt, have Hosp
i-tele.

Hosp-i-tele is a Health Services
program designed for students who
aren’t sick enough to be admitted to
the “hospital proper" but are too ill to
live in the dorms. according to Health
Services Director Donna Bailey. The
college contiacts with Grinncll Re-
gional Medical Center each year for
the service, which is paid for with
funds from students’ health foes.

Since budgetsaredue in Novem-
ber, the Bailey said Health Services
has recently begun to talk terms with
the hospital. Bailey doesn‘tanucipate
any significant changes to the cone
tract.

While hospitalized through the
Hosp-i-tele program, patients receive

one of two levels of minimal level of
nursing care, but not regular monitor-
ing oradector'scare. When the Hosp—
irtele program first replaced the
college‘s infirmary in 1986, patients
numbered around seventy per year.

Numbershavedeclined, however,
since 1990, when the hospital began
its Outpaucnlobserviiuon (0P0) pro-
gram. 0P0 patients would be treated
by a doctor and monitored regularly.
The cost of this care falls to the student
or to his or her insurance, but it is a
necessary action formoresetious prob-
lems.

Bailey doesn’t believe that the
dccliningnumbersendangerthe Hosp
i»tele program. “We need to have a
facility where people who live a great
distance from home can go for those
illnesses that could be treated at home
butwouldbeuncomfonableinadorm."

The number of patients in

Lined. When Tanya Hedges ‘96 cone
Lracted her second case of chicken pox
during spring ﬁnals week of her ﬁrst
year at Gnnnell, she was sent to a
quarantined room atGrinnell Regional
through the Hospirtele program.
Hedges was there for five days
(Bailey says the average stay in Hosp-
H.316 is two-three days) and remained

at school another week to take her
finals. 'ntough dealing with chicken
pox was a major inconvenience,
Hedges says she was satisfied with the
care she received. "I think it's a really
good resource for the college to have.
It'sreallynice to get moderate medical
care and be watched without having to
pay huge bill,"

Individualscancheck themselves
ianosp—i»tele,butBailey saysthings
go more smoothly if the sludean are
admitted by HealthCenter employees.
If the Health Center is closed, an RLC
can admit someone to Hospitele.

If the suident desires, the Health
Center will tell his or her professors of
the student’s illness and admission to
Hosp»i-tele.

According to Bailey, no bubonic
like epidemicsare running rampant on
campus. However, ‘We have seen a
fairly good number of upper respira-
tory infections~or the common cold.
The majority are not running an el-
evated temperature They're having
the head congestion, the sore throat,
the chest cough.”

Bailey suspects that much of the
illness is allergyrrelated, triggered by
the seasonal high ragweed pollen
counts and airborne particles from the
drying com and soybean crops.
