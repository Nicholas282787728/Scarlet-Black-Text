Nebraska reservation to
get student makeover

By DANYA LEEBAW
Staff Wriler

group of Grinnell students
is planning to spend their
fall break constructing and

reconstructing homes on the
Winnebago and Omaha Indian Res-
ervations in northeast Nebraska.

The trip is in conjunction with
theWinncbagoandOmaha Ln'bes,as
well as the collegeebased Native
American Interest Group. In the
daytime, the students will do con-
struction work and in the evenings,
various activities will be planned to
enhance the participating students’
cultural awareness.

One of these activities will be
participating in a sweat lodge—a
Native American ritual involving
spiritual meditation. According to
Doug Schenkelberg, the trip‘s plan-
ncr, another evening will likely be
spent hearing people from thereser-
vationtalkaboutﬂleirlivesand”what
it means to live on the reservation
and what it’s like to live there.”

Schenkelbcrg spent last summer

doing independent research on the
Winnebago reservanon. He described
the Winnebago reservation as “very
pom.”'[heavtaageineomeiswellbelow
the national average. The unemploy-
ment late is extremely high. Gangs are
activeonthereservatimmndalwholism
and drug use is nlmpanL

According to Schenkelberg, vol-
unteers often came in to work on the
reservation, “asked all sorts ofques-
lions, worked, and were never heard
from again. So there were lots of
hun feelings toward people like
myself."

This summer, Schenkelberg
asked the people on the reservation
if there was a way in which he and a
group of students could return and
offer help. The people suggested
helping to maintain andbuild homes.

Nearly all the houses on the
reservation are HUD homes;
Schenkelbcrg describes these houses
as “shoddily made—they fall apart
within ten years. Coming in and
helping toreconstructhomes isabig
thing—they just don't have the
means.”

of sesquicentennial celebration
will publish about 10,000 cop-
ies, a few of which will be sent to
policymakers in the nation‘s
capital.

McClung elaborated on this
possibility when he commented.
“I imagine our little book being
on night tables in Washington
and other power centers, and that
a few or our ideas would take
root in the minds of the Gores,
theClintonsandotherswhomight
be in a position to act on them."

Although the actual celebra»
tion ofthe Grinnell's 150th anni-
versary won’tbcgin until the fall
of 1995, plans are already under»
way.

The committee in charge of
planning the activities has already
planned a number of events that

will commemorate Grinnell's
sesquicentennial.

During the sesquicentennial
celebration, there will be a num-
ber of special convocations and
symposiums.

Also, the college has invited
several alumni visitors to deliver
talks and share ideas with stu-
dents.

In addition, there will be a
special interim session offered
during Ianuary of 1995. The in-
terim session is tentatively being
planned [or January 8720. The
interim session will consist of
three separate sessions that are
each three days long.

Some of the possible topics
for the threevday institutes in-
clude: the professions and the lib-
eral arts, literary creation and

criticism and the future of sci-
ence.

Organizers are hoping to
have about 300 participants take
part in the interim session. Dur-
ing the last weekend in April of
1996, the campus communitywill
be host to a huge 150th birthday
party.

Students, faculty, adminis-
tration, staff and select alumni
will be able to participate in a
number of activities including
theatrical performances, con-
certs, an all-campus picnic and
Spring Waltz.

Organizers of the sesquicen—
tennial celebration are planning
to hold the Spring Waltz and all»
campus picnic under a large tent on
Mac Field.
