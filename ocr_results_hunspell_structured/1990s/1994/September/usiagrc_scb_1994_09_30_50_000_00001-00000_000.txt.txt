OR the past several years,
F Grinnell's ranking in US

News and WorldReport'S list
of the best colleges and universities
in the country has been falling. In
1989, Grinnell College was ranked
iOthin thenationi In 1992,the school
heldthe 14thspot. Lastyear, in 1993,
Grinnellplummctted to 16th,and this
year, the college weighed in at 17th.

Some students, faculty, and
alumni have undoubtedly started to
wonderaboutwhatis happening. But
Grinnell‘s slip in rank has nothing to
do with academics or the quality of
Grinnell’s education, according to
President Pamela Ferguson and ofﬁe
cials at US New: and World Report.

“Candidly, l6th and 17th
[rankings] are about the same," said
Ferguson. “I‘m not worried about it.
No one would buy me magazine if
the ratings didn’t change,”

Bob Morse, spokesman for US
Ncwxand Worldchorr, agreed. say-
ing that the methodology used to de-
termine rankings has changed over
the past several years. which reﬂects
Grinnell’s change on the chart.

“Grinnell's change during the
past three years isn't really signiﬁ-
cant,“hesaid. “This year,graduation
tank weighed 15 percent. Last year,
it was only 10 percent. Likewise, we
reduced the weight of financial re
sources from lSpercent to 10pcrcent

Graduation Rate
Both Morse and Ferguson agree
thatGrinnell‘sgtaduationrateisitsweak—

probably pulled Grinnell down this year
to number 17. According to statistics
gatheredby USNewsand WorldReport.
only 80 percent of students who start at
Grinnell acuially go on to graduate.
“Oneway wccouldbesuongcris to

“[Suidmts at Grinnell] are smart and I
know [students thatdmpoutofGrinnell]
ate graduating from somewhere. Our
graduation rate should be 90 petoent
given the caliber of our students.”
Ferguson said that the administra-
tion will be investigating the Grinnell
dropout rate more closely in the future.
Academic Reputation
Students should in no way be
disappointed with Grinnell's number
17 ranking this year, said Ferguson.
Although the school did slip one notch
on the chart, Grinnell’s academic
reputation remained the same that it
was last year at number 10. In fact,
Grinnell‘s academic reputation has
actually climbed since 1991 when its
academic reputation was ranked 13th.
Being rankednurnber 10is actu
ally like being ranked him because

only five schools above us on the
chart are actually ranked higher aca-
demically, Ferguson said,
“1 think tenth is really good be-
cause it's really fifth,” she said.
Morse also pointed outGrinnell's
“excellent reputation," and then went
on to say that the school is ranked
number one on the magazine’s list of
best buys. Though he did not say so
directly, Mom-blunted ihatbeing ranked
number one on one list often affects
one‘s place on another list
“Grinnell's stronger area is fi-
nancial resources." he said. “Our
BestBuys list reﬂects that. Butin our
best overall colleges and universities
list, we don’tweigh financialassets."
“Thekeything isthatwhatmakes
us 17th on one list makes us number
one on another list.” Ferguson said.
”When you look at their ﬁnancial
resourcesmodel, ourchoosing tokeep
our was lower hurts us [on the over-
all ranking list}."
Study not scientiﬁc
Students should also remember
that the US New: and World Report
list is not scientiﬁc, Ferguson said.
“I think they really try very hard
to be fair and to make it as scientiﬁc
as possible," she said. “Whatever we
are rated, 1 think students and faculty
here really know how good we are."

Grinnell named number
one best buy in America

Ferguson, Grinnell students are
admitted on their “ability to learn,
not their ability to pay." About 70
percent of the studentbody receives
financial aid and the college’s fi-
nancial aid budget is nearly nine
million dollars.

Ferguson credits the hard work
and dedication of faculty for its
first-place ranking in best buys.

to make that quality education avail-
able to all qualified students is an
important part of our school‘s his
tory," she said. “Grinnell’s policy
is to admit qualified students rev
gardless of family income,”

Not only was Grinnell ranked
the top buy in the country, but it
also grabbed the second place slot

REVUOLTION A late crowd gathered yoﬁerday to hear conv0<
cation speaker John Murrin speak about revolutions and their tie to
nation-making.

 

 

Students learn about
revolutions at convo

By JULIE MICKENS
StaffWriter

VER one hundred people
turned out for yesterday’s
Scholars‘ Convocation, sur-

prisingcvcnspeakerlohnM.Murrin.
a Princeton professor of history who
delivered the lecture, “War, Revolu-
tion and Nation-Making: The Ameri-
can Revolution vs. the Civil War."

Although attendance was re-
quired for American History 111 stu-
dents and for the Servants and Slates
tutorial, quite a few students came
simply because they “thought it
sounded intermiug."

First-year David Read said, “I
went voluntarily. I actually decided
to spend ﬁfty minutes listening to
this guy talk. I learned a lot about
both wars thatl hadn‘tknown before.
It was good."

Professor Don Sm ith. who intro—
duced Murrin, was pleased with the
attendance. “I thought that the tum-
out was good, even better was that (as
far as I could tell) the entire audience
remained for the entire lecture."

Mun-in staned off his lecturewilh
a reference to “America's favorite

daytime soap opera, [the Civil War]"
and went on to describe the troubled
affairs of “Sam” and “Ante-bellum,"
or the Union and Confederacy in the
American Civil War. He also noted
Uncle Sam‘s resemblance to Abe
Lincoln. This gota few laughs from
Ihecrowd, but Mun-in plunged ahead
into the body of his lecture, refuting
the generally accepted assumptions
about the American Revolutionary
and Civil Wars.

Conventionally, Murrin said,
people consider Confederate nation-
alism to be “something run amo
that “deserves to lose” and think that
colonial Americans were unified
against British tyranny prior to the
Revolutionary War with a national-
ism that “deserved lo win." Murr'in
argued that the Southern Confeder-
ate states were in fact more nationalv
istic than the American colonies.
While the Confederate states had se-
ceded from the union andestahlished
their own government by the time the
war staned, the American colonists
still thoughtof themselves as citizens
of the British empire.
