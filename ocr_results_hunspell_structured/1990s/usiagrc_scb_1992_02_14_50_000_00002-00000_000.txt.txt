day and Thursday aboutways to avoid
conﬂict and irrationality in groups,
businesses,byundersiandingtheways
these groups operate.

“1 think the main idea of these
lectures has been that irrationality is
the result of ‘either/or thinking,’ and
is the resultof not being able to keep
the head and the heart in the same
place." said Bmxton after the firstof
his talks in South Lounge. which was
entitled “Managing Personal and
Organiztional Boundaries thn Or;

" ganizations Behave Irrationally.”
