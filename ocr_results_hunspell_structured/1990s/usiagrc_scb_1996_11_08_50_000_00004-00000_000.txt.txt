The opcn forum “Responses to
The Gum" held last Monday, N0—
vember4 and sponsored by SGA was
considered to be a success by many
of the approximately 150 who at-
tended. Many individuals shared
their ideas about the Gum “ad” and
subsequent den
velopments.
Sin'ce SGA's
main objective»
this year is to
encourage and
facilitate com-
munication be-
tween different
facets of the
campus com-
munity, we feel
that Monday’s
open forum was
a step in the
right direction.
Opcn dialogue
about racial |Sr
sues on this campus is important, not
only to ensure that all viewpoints are
aired, but also to raise the level of
campus awareness so that we can
move beyond disagreement, anger
and hurt to positive solutions.

Two criticisms ofMonday night’s
open forum seem especially esscnr
tial: first, it has been noted that many
people, especially those whose views
are as yet undeﬁned, or who feel that
if they express their ideas they will
be attacked, did not attend. Many of
the opinions expressed there are the
same opinions that have been stated
at past forums such as the Speak Easy

for all of us to educate ourselves

strom has already accumulated $500
in cash and prizes playing the Des

of the bands at Super Toad, a bar in
Des Moines. By winning for three
consecutive weeks, the blind has
made its way to the finals of this
competition, which Will take place

responses from radio listeners.

Band member James Rechs ‘97
said ofplztying outside Grinncll. “It’s
exciting to have people that aren‘t
your friends, people you don't even
know, come up to you and tell you
that you’re good. But we still love to
play at Grinnell. We can heoursetves
here." In agreement with Rechs, felr
low band member Jeremy Boley ‘97
said, “After playing in Des Moines,
it Will be really neat to play at
Grinnell again, in front of people we
know;we havealot more funAt Des
Moines we’re nervous and we need
to be more professional,

Among the beneﬁts of perform»
ing outside Grinnell, Rechs and
Boley include getting paid and
avoiding the cost and time put into
setting up for themselves “At Dcs
Moines, all we ltave to do is play "
The band has already been asked to

Thus. it seems strange that so
many of us‘ are will g to drive
such great distances to sample
truckstop culture and be called
honey by waitresses and patrons
alike.

The attraction for many people,
me thinks, is that there's an ele-

Racism is "one’s affirmation of or ac-
quiescence to or lack of recognition
of the structures and mechanisms of
the racial state; one’s lack t0 aware—
ness of or blindness or indifference to
ones being racialized; one’s affirma—
tion of, indifference or blindness to,
the harm that the racial state inﬂicts
on some of its members” (Lugones
from Making Face, Making Soul;

We the undersigned found the ad
which appeared in the GUM on Oc-
tober 15 to be Offensive and racist
because it addressed ASIA as "asi—
nine", suggesting that they "swindle
funds from SGA", and implied that
their causes are "ludicrous." By sug-
gesting that the ad was simply a
form of satire, the authors are/were
”indifferent to the harm" that their ad
inflicted on members of ASIA and
this is a component of racism as
shown in the definition above.

into a car and driving to THE
WORLD’S BIGGEST TRUCK—
STOP or one of its less overwhelm-
ing counterparts.

Pulling into the crowded parking
lot filled with hundreds (okay,
scores) of eighteenrwheelers, some
parked for the night and some just
for a few hours. one gets the feeling
that if this were a really big movie,
the truekstop would be a space sta-
tion. There would be aliens every»
where, some friendly and some less
friendly, Truckstops are amusement
parks for people-watchers.

The interesting part, however, is
that not only do college students go
to truckstops to watch the truckers,
thc truckers go to watch the college
students, and the guy sitting at the
counter with the suitcase full ofsto-
len government secrets is watching

_, everyone.

Perhaps that’s why truckstops are
so much fun. Watching all kinds of
people come and go, people one
knows one will never see again, is a
thrill. It’s like going to the airport,
hot the food’s good and home's only
a few exits away.
