By MARK HUANG
Staff Writer

HEN dance instructor
BIG. Voertman an
nounced her retirement

late last year, the Grinnell commu»
nity founditseli losinga good teacher.
The search went out immediately for
aperson toﬁll the temporary position
as dance instructor and head of the
Dance Troupe, and the college was
lucky to ﬁnd an exceptionally quali—
tied applicant from Iowa City: Marc
Kotz.

Originme from Bambridge Is-
land, Washington, Kotz got inter
ested in dance after working in
children‘s theatre. He was always
drawntoperformingandfelttheneed
to develop himself physically in an
expressive way. Dance has allowed
Marc to grow and change both physir
cally and emotionally. In his teens,
he started learning the Skinner Re-
leasing Technique, which uses imag-
ery and improvisational exercises as
primary motives, and because it
helped him develop his creative sen-
sibilities right away, he hopes to be
able to teach it here at Grinnell

Kotz received his bachelor’s
degree at Empire State College in
New York City, and because of the
expanse of the city and the resources
available to a learning artist, he was
able to transform the entire city into
his campus After graduation he
moved to Connecticut, where he
danced for the Hartford Ballet and
taught After another four years back
in New York City dancing in the Lar
Lubovitch Dance Company, Marc
feltthe need to movesomeplace else
“(In New York], it‘s hard to live as a
dance anist. The political mecha
nism is ultimately detrimental for the
artistic life of a choreographer."

Deciding to try his hand at
academia, he visited the University
of Iowa in Iowa City and received a
fellowshipformeirgraduatcprogram.
His move from New York was a
“deliverance from a lifestyle that
wasn’tworking forme." With the aid
of his fellowship, he was able to
concentrateongettjnghis MFA with—
out having to teach, and he graduated
last May.

Kotz feels very lucky to be here.

often be a bit dicey, but we have
someone here who is experienced
and extremely well qualified"

One ofthe special additions that
hiring Marc has brought to Grinnell
is the inclusion oiballet classes. PKG
viously, ballot was not offered either
asaclassorasapanofDanceTroupc,
except during special times when
someoncoutside of Grinnell was hired
to come in. Marc hopes that come
spring, when the Dance Troupe puts
on its annual Dance Concert, there
will be two or three ballet pieces.

Besides ballet, Kotz tsalso well-
versed in performing and teaching
numerous modern techniques. He is
trained in Baroque dancing, or 18Ih
century French court dancing, which
was a precursor to modern ballet He
has also trained in contact improv
and Japanese dance, most specifi-
cally the Kabuki style. Said
Czechowski, “Marc’s background is
quite impressive, exhibiting breadth
of interest and training as choreogra-
pher, teacher and perfon'ner,” One
area that Marc is currently working
on is aerial dance, or trapeze work.
An associate of his in Madison who
has been training in aerial dance for
about ten years, has invited Marc to
come up and teach release techniques.
Choreography on a trapeze is multis
disciplinary work that has Marc very
excited. “It extends thepossibility of
dance and opens up a whole new
dimension of bodies moving through
space." he said.

Although he has only been on
campus a short time, Marc already
hasastrong appreciation forGrinnell
and the people here. He says, “Grin-
nell students are bright and enthusir
astic. You don’t have to pull hair

getting someone involved." While
hoisherehehopestomaketheDance
Troupeavisiblcbodyoncampusand
to educate the campus at large to
wards an appreciation for the diver»
sity that is dance. For Kotz, the
Dance Troupe is the focus, l-lc com~
pares them with the dance company
at University of Iowa in both energy
and time commitment. “The poten-
tial here is great,“ he said.

Kotz has also had an effect on a
few of the students. Says first—year
Dance Troupe member Severin
Oman, ”Marc is awesome." Oman
cited several reasons, such as Kotz's
emphasis on getting in touch with
your body and finding a personal
motive for each move.

Kotz’s praise also extends be
yond the boundaries of Grinnell. “In
Iowa, you sort of feel like part ofan
anistcommunity. Butit’s spread out
all over. There are people; you just
have to find them.” The artist com-
munity is very important to Marc,
and he would like to cultivate artistic
vision in our students. “Artistic vi»
sion underlies the notion of being
interactive and responsive to your
environment. It is interactive life
involvement." Grinnell seems to be
the idealplace forhim, a“microcosm
of the world at larger"

According to Kotz, “If you're
goingtobeinvolvedinartinaserious
way,youhavetoletitconsumeyou."
While this may soundlikeathreaten-
ing prospect, it illustrates how im-
ponant artistic expression is to him,
“Everyone who chooses an art form
does so so that they can relate to it."
Hopefully, with his presence on this
campus, everyone will choose an art
form.
