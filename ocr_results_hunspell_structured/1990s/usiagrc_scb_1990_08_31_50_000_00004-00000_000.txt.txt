Students Token
In Presidential
Search Process

In twoweeks,thePresidentiatSearchCommittee willbegintoexamine
the applications for the future Grinnell College president of this college
During the summer, the committee held meetings to determine what
qualities the Grinnell community desired in its president Two students
participated.

Because only two students were selected, it seems that the Board of
Tmstees. which selected the student members, are not seriously interested
in student inpuL They appear to have only included token student
representation on a committee that may well dictate the future of this
college. This must be changed.

Pedro Femandez-McCanhy and Deb Koa were selected as committee
members on the basis of their victories in the SGA presidential and vice-
presidential elections. Yet, can they, or for that matter, can any two
people, adequately represent the diversity of this student bode

The Scarlet and Black harbors no animosity towards Femandez—
McCarthy and Koa. But their SGA duties already require a signiﬁcant
time commitment. and thereforeto adequately represent the student body,
their work must be supplemented by additional student representatives.

Applications for the committee should be made available for all
students as they are forsome of thestanding committees like theRosenﬁeld
Committee If we intend to give serious consideration about who should
be president of this college, we should give serious considemtion about
who will be deciding.

Before the process of screening applicants, more suidents. reﬂecting
the diversity of ideas and activities here atGrinnell. should be added to the
committee. Otherwise, those affected the most by changing presidents
will only have a token voice. Deciding about the future of this college is

too imponant for the students to be ignored.

UNCLE SAM'S
NEWEST PLAN. . .

...DRIP DRY

 

Keep "Permanent" Commitment

The decision by Dining Services to alter the evening opening hours of the dining halts
demonstrates an obvious ignorance about the living habits of Grinnell students.

Perhaps they really think that thereis a new breed of college student that is notonly inline when
breakfast opensat7:15 a.m. butis also in bed fast asleep even before others have made it to Burling
for the evening. Maybe it has even been deemed that the South Campus student is a type of animal
fit for experimental starving from before 5 pm. until bedtime at 2 am. or so.

Or is it, perhaps, an accidental ploy to boost the profits of certain pizza traders in town? At
least it can be said that it looks neat printed on paper.

Sadly, that is the only place it does look good. it is a wildly impractical scheme that one hopes
will, within a tew weeks, live on only in the memories (or nightmares) of the student body.

The new policy will cause trouble in particular for Quad workers who will nowhave to eat asearly
as 4 pm. without improving the lot of the Cowles worker who will still remain until 8 pm. It will
also disrupt student activities, such as aerobics, that were scheduled for hours that now conﬂict with
the new schedule

And there can be little doubt about the obvious need, given the new hours, for the message on
Sheila’s desk at Cowles, ”Try Quad, you’ll like it!”

Drop New Dining Hall Schedule

In an effort to reduce the material waste that Crinnell sends to landfills, Dining Services has
implemented reusable dishware at all outdoor activities as well as in the Forum. This effort should
be applauded.

This long overdue plan to reduce waste is economically realistic and can be easily embraced by
the college community. Student, faculty, and administrative cooperation could reduce waste by as
much as 80 percent.

Consumersat the Forum Grill should follow the guidelines and retum plasllc cups and mugs after
they have been used. When permanenlware is used at picnics, it should also be returned,

Clearly from the response at Tuesday’s all-campus picnic, students adaptcd quickly to the use
of the dishes. Pooplcrcturncd them without complaint, and for the most part, werecnthusmstic
about the experiment.

It is now necessary for the campus to retain its support for Dining Services’ commitmentto
protecting the envtronment. To support the project, dishware must be returned,
