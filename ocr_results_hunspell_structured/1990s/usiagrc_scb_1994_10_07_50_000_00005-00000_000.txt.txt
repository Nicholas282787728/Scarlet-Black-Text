Alumnus’ donations on display in Burling

By SARAH STAVETEIG
StaffWriter

W often do you have the
chance to stand next to a
modern American paper

mache sculpture while admiring
Bronze Age Chinese bowls a few feet
away? Now’sthe time. Until October
14th, a Clinton Rehling exhibit is be
ing shown downstairs in the Burling
Library. Rehling, a Grinnell alumnus
from 1939, has generously endowed
over three hundred works of art to
Grinnell. Staning in 1974, he has
donated paintings, sculpture and pets
to the college‘s permanent art collec-
tion.

Ampleefhiscollecu’on exempli-
fies Rehling’s camer in the navy and the
United Nations because the pieces re-
ﬂect his international interests. It is a
diverse collection: works include Airi-
can Masks, irrdian sculptures, Egyptian
fragments from the Ptolemaic Period,
Greek works, works by Pablo Picasso
and modern American Paintings.

Rehling gave a talk at the library
on Friday, September23. He relateda
few stories of his adventures collect»
ing art He genuinely enjoyed select»
ing each particular piece because of
the signiﬁcance it had for him. Each
piece displayed has a particular story
to it. A good example of this is a
drawing by Man Ray, Id, 1943. It
depicts chess pieces as symbolic of the
fallen ccuntryof France during World
War ll. Rehling liked this piece par
ticularly because it was important to
the mist. “Raywanted tokrlow ifﬁve
dollars was too much for the piece. I
told him that I didn‘t think it was
nearly enough."

Barbour is quick to praise Green
Frog and everything about it. She
says, “It’s cool to see the kids during
the workshops because their faces just
lightup. They’re so much more uninr
