Brian Dart '96 is Elirpron,
onnnell's lone purveyor or mostly—
electronic inusic. Dart is currently
rebounding from his fall and subse.
quent rise at Aliee in Wonderland,
whenhiscompurer(anancientAppIe
nos) crashed and prevenred him
from meeting his scheduled perfon
mance time (Darr recovered and pe-
iorrned or three the tollowing morn»
ing). Unfortunately, his planned
show at the Coffee Cellars in Iowa
Ciry wirh Much, Big Window, and
Curious has been cancelled. Darr,
after relying last year on three songs,
debuted ti new song called “Insecu—
rity" earlier rhis year, and is working
on a new song whieh, he says, is
“about electric shock,” Other Ellip—
ron songs address the topics utparn.
sitir: worms and something called
“The Limiter," which we think has
something to do with censorship.
