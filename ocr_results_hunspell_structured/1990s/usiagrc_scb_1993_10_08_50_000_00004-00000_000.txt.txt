LL, it‘s a marvelous
night for a moondance“

AsI make my way across cam-
pus toward an inevitable third floor
stall in Burling, Ican'thelp but burn
a little Van Morrison. The leaves are
turning omnge gold and deep crim—
son again. There‘s an undeniably
brisk chill in the Iowa winds and the
cutoff shons have ﬁnally—though
somewhat reluctantly—been retired
to tile dirty clothes hamper, only to
be replaced by turtleneck sweaters
and the comfy old stand-by: plaid
ﬂannels. Of course, Grinnell stuA
dentsdon‘tseem quiteready to relin-
quish their Birks just yet But there
has suddenly appeared a plethora of
wool socks where there had once
been bare tootsies and rosy heels.

Yetatthesametimejtseemslike
an awful lot of these feet are plodding
alonginthewtongdirection: away from
the Great Outdoors and toward the cli-
matecmboﬂetlhgtidngenhancedstcr-
ilc inmrds of ARH, Burling, YMCA,
and dorm study lounges. So this week,
somethinginthclwinklingoflhcstarsis
telling me that this school needs a little
colltxt'tve cosmic advice. . . .

Virgo: (Afterall, a new Grinncll is
born every August)

Don’t miss ottt on the Farmer’s
Matkct. It doesn't last all year, you
lmow. Go getapurnplcin,plantyoutself
on Mac ﬁeld or lean against the loggia,
and carve your own personal tribute to
the spirit of autumns and Hallowocns
past

You missed thcblue moon,didn't
you? Well, don'twaituntil the next full
moon to do your nightsky gazing. The
stars are a lot clearer than what you’re
glimpsingthroughdinydormwindows.
Gooulside and makea wish. Even if it
doesn'tcome true, you‘ll never know
until you try.

It" you haven’tmchhe-Trw-with-
therDoorrinAIt, push aside your books,
suclch yourlegsand venture behind the
library. You’ll have todomorethttnjust
100k Fccl around. You’ll ﬁnd it

I guess Grinncll’s collective 7o
diac is pretty simple: Follow your
cosmic yen. Get outside Enjoy the
weather. It is a marvelous night

Grinnellians Have Become
Addicted to Life on the VaX

Approximately 1 785 messages are sent out every day, and 1.3 million messages
have been logged since mid-1991

By Sarah Cornell

N the wake of the controversy
Iover student responsibility for

computer damage, Grinnellians
have become much more aware of
the College‘s computer system. A
world without e-mail would be any
noying to say the least, and a world
without word processors would be
difficult!

But what does the Vax do for
you? Itbringsprofessors,old friends,
and the cute guy from economics
right into your daily life. Assign-
ments professors forget to give out
in class aren’t impossible after all
(nomatterhowmuchyouwantthem
to be), you don’t have to wait for
your daily “snail mail" from the
post ofﬁce to hear from your best
friend from home, and as long asyou
know that guy’s last name, you've
got a possible date right there at
your ﬁngertips.

Brian McMahon, a Grinnell
alumnus and computer programmer
for Grinnell College Computer Ser-

vices (GCCS) tells the Scarlel &
Elack : “c-mail is so ingrained in uS,
it’s taken for granted." Electronic
mail has been used at Grinncll since
James Allan, '82, designed the pro
gram ‘Drcams‘ in the early 30’s.
Students have always made great
use of Dreams, and the program still
runs very well with a few modifica—
tions and additions, Even a decade
ago, Grinnell was at the front oftlte
pack technologically. When GCCS
joined Bitnet in 1986, the network
itself was still fairly new.
McMahon also offered these sta-
tistics: since July 1, 1991, the last
date that Computer Services reset
the numberofmessagessent.roughly
1,3 million Email messages have
beensent. That’550,000permonth,
12,500 per week, and 1785 per day!
Approximately 85—90% of all mail
sent is directed to on-campus ad-
dresses. Incoming E-mail numbers
in the 142 thousand range every day.
Thatmeans friends, family, and elec»
Lronic news services can, and do,
reach the small town of Grinnellr

At RUSH

Amessagesentgoesrightto the
postmaster program. The ‘postmas-
tcr' decides to route it to Internet,
where all onrcampus mail goes. If
themessagehasaBitnetaddress,the
postmaster dumps it down another
theoretical chute.

Then message just waits until
the receiver logs on and sees that she
has a new message. When she types
<mail/n>,thecomputercallsupfrom
the electronic post office the mes-
sage. Instantaneously, the message
appears on her screen just as it was
printed minutes before!

Communication via ‘Dreams’
has become the single way students
can be absolutely sure that a mes
sage gets through to a friend, aprof,
oranyoneelse. Answering machines
aregreat,butwholikestohavethem-
selves recorded unexpectedly? Par
per notes arejust as good as Email
because the writer has a chance to
compose his or her thoughts, but
what if the paper gets lost or der
stroyed?

Email is the perfect alterna-

it’s a fine line that separates the University

from the Hospttal

When students lirst visit Rush University they ottsn ask, ‘Where's the campus? And our reply is,
”Everywhere? That's because you will lind our students throughout Rush-Presbyterian—St. Luke's

University. The hallmark ot Flush is Its unitication of education and practice which promotes a dynamic
