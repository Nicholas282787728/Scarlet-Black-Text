Sports Information

Today the Grinnell College
women’s swim team travels to
Lawrence College in Appleton,
Wisonsin, for the Midwest Confer»
ence championship meet. Predicted
to finish second in a recent poll of
conference coaches. the Pioneers
will face tough competition from
favorite Lake Forest and third-
ranked Lawrence. Coach Erin
Hurley believes a secondeplace fin-
ish is realistic. but also that her
swimmers have the potential to rise
above expectations.

“We‘ve been pretty good about
limiting our mistakes throughout the
season." she said. ”If we can cori-
tinue that and ifthe people who are
not seeded so high are able to score,
we can deﬁnitely close the gap on
Lake Forest. It's a three day meet
with two diving sessions so a lotcan
happen. I think our swimmers are
ready."

The Pioneers are particularly
strong in the breaststroke and indlv
vidual medley events. Also, diver
Jo Schaalman is expected to finish
first in both diving events. With a
week of resting and polishing starts
and turns, every swimmer ideally
will peak for the meet.
