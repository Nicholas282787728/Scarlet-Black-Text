“Queen of the Blues”
Koko Taylor singing
here tomorrow night

By Jennifer Stukas

After 30 years and seven Grammy
nominations (including a Grammy
for Best Blues Recording in 1984),
Koko Taylor has rightfully earned
her title “Queen of the Blues.“ Who
else could sing, with verve and soul,
a line like “When you dance with my
man, girl/ You’re steppin’ on my
toes," and not leave her audience
laughing? Or nansfonn a mediocre
Ted Nugent song (“Hey Baby") into
an energetic, musical sexual proposi-
tion?

With a voice that easily encom»
passes both the lowest most soulful
notes and the highest soprano, punc-
tuated with howls and yelps of de-
light, Koko Taylor seems able to ac-
complish anything.

Koko Taylor first began singing
the blues with her brothers on the
sharecropper’s farm in Tennessee

The City Heiress satirizes gender
roles of 17th-Century England

By Michael Kavanagh

The City Heiress, a play by the
17th Century author and playwright
Aphra Behn. will be performed as a
production of the Grinnell College
Theatre Department tonight and Sat-
urday night at 8:00 in Roberts The
arer. The play. set in Restoration-era
England. is acomplex tale oflove and
deceit It employs some attitudes to
wards men and women, and sex and
marriage which will appear quite
modern and progressive to the 20th
Century viewer.

The plot centers around the charac-
ter Tom Wilding (played by ﬁrst
year student Matthew Athenon) and
his relentless pursuit of not only the

inheritance of his uncle butalso of the
“city heiress," Chariot Gettall (played
by Elisa Erali).

Aphra Behn was an exceptional
ﬁgure in early English drama. as she
was the ﬁrst English woman to have
her plays published. According to
13.0. Voertman (this production‘s
director), Behn was a “political ac-
tivist" who took on many causes we
generally think of as being modern,
speciﬁcally abolitionism and femi-
nism. Behn was outspoken in her
support of women’s rights.

in The City Heirers.Behn expresses
some of her early feminist views by
depicting. in a lighthearted and one
medic setting. some of the social ob»
stacles faced by women in the 17th

Century
TheTheatreDeparttnent‘sproduc-

tion of The City Heiress is very im-
pressive in that it is presented in full
period costumer On a purely aesthetic
level alone. the play is deﬁnitely
worth seeing, not only because of the
brilliantcostumesbutalsobtwauseof '
the beautiful, expertly-crafted set as
well, This production has done an
excellent job of authentically recreat-
ing the atmosphere of Restoration ,
England and. at the same time. the
actors and actresses present a delight-
ful play by a unique and interesting
playwright,
