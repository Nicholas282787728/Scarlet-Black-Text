I think I have asolution. We have to
face the fact that whatever we‘ve
been doing in the pursuit of male.
female relations thus far simple isn't
working. Therefore I suggest we take
our cues from our friends the birds
and come up with some nifty cautt<

four years of prime fertility sitting

brighter plumage couldn’t hurt.
However it’s probably a good idea if

Radical Chic

Setting out to comfort the afﬂicted
and afﬂict the comfortable

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

A few weeks ago, I discussed in
the Features Section how the US
uses weaponssales, low intensitycon-
flici,anddirectinterventiontomain—
tainglobaleconomichegemonyover
the developing world. In this col.
umn, l W|II discussjust how much the
US spends on militarism, and then
why we spend all this money on war
preparation: First. to maintain near
colonial control over the developing
world;andsecond,totransfercashio
the “Chile maintain plutocratic
control of domestic resources.

Level oispending

The Department of Defense
(DOD) will receive more than $250
billion this year. Total war spending
will run. including the Energy De—
partment's nuclear weapons plants,
Veteran's benefits,etc..$620billion,
according to war Reststor's League
figures, This represents more than
50% or total government spending

As RosenfleldspeakerLawrence
Korb explained, “Bill Clinton will
spend more on defense than Richard
Nixon did two decades ago ($260
billion as against $230 billion in in.
flatlonetldlusted dollars), and the
United states will spend more for
national security than the rest ofthe
world combined," “The us alone
spends five times more than any oth—
er nation in the world."

With our allies, we account for
80% of all military spending in the
world. our DOD budget is larger
than that of the next six highest—
spendingnatiunsCombined.TheUS
DOD budget is 17 times as large as

tries generally identified as our ad«
Versarles (N, Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria,
Libya, and Cuba).

\Vhat is the us preparing foil
l<orb continues, explaining that the
DOD concludes “that the us needs
to maintain the capability to con.
duci and win two simultaneous wars
(e.g., in Korea and the Persian Gulf)
with no buildup period for our forc—
es, no allies to help and without the
ability to roiate forces."

Retaining Neocolonial Control

The first reason {or us military
buildup is economic. lrive don’t have
massive inierveiitionary forces,
backed up by nuclear weapons, we
will be unable to continue our global
rape and pillage of the developing
naiions. it is virtually rautological
that economic exploiiaticn requires
force. The U5 steals the resources of
the poor. Ergo, we need lots of guns
and soldiers to kill anyone who ob—
iects, This is covered more analyti—
cally in ihefeaturessection,4.l9.9o.

Wealth Transfer Up
The other big factor in ravor of
huge dercnse budgets is that they

nincucn as an easy way for the rich«
esi people iii this country to become

even richer. First, the nch are the
ones who own and run the defense

war spending is welfare for the
rich ln Harry s. Truman and the
War Scare (#1948. Frank Kofsky
details the “campaign to deceive the
nation,” from Truman’s manufac-
tured “war scare" in 1948 to
Kennedy’s “missile gap” in 1961 to
Reagan’s “window of vulnerability."
Consistentlysince 1948 (and before.
actually),usindustryhasbeensaved
fromfree markets by massive govern—
ment war subsidies. This is an inten—
tional and coherent policy which
recognizes the need for government
intervention to save the economy,
but which prefers to do it by subsidiz-
ing Cnpitzlldi‘IenSiVe business ven«

erful in examining lntelllgenceanul—
yses and explaining the history of
this policy of Keynesian military
spending for the rich.

And who are these companies
wesupportwith goVernmenlenUtIE/
mentsl The defense contractors are
guilty of mind—blowing graft and de—
ceit: Every single one of the top four
has been convicted in federal court
of bilking the government at least 3
times. lfrhese were welfare mothers
stealing one onermillionth of the
amount these contractors are C0n<
victed ofstealmg, there would be an
uproar.

But even beyond the outright
graft, theUSblllingsystemispathet-
ically lax, as ifintending to allow the
very rich to become richer courtesy

ing articles in the Washington Post
(5—14—95 and 1 1—15—95) spell out the
unbelievableinefficiencyofUS DOD
spending,Forexamplediscussingthe
improvement in accountability. we
learn that ”the amount of spending
that cannot be traced with certainty
toparticularpurchaseshasfallenfrom
$50 billion in lune 1993 to $20.5
billion in September," The DOD’s
systems for paying contractors are so
bad that error—prone "that it is some
times difficult to tell whether a pay—
ment has been made. whether it is
correct.orevenwhatitpaidfor...Thc

the old standard still applies to its

contractors there complained that a
newstandard would dramatical ly slow
payments." Can you imagine if a
welfare mothercomplained about her
slow $200 monthly AFDC payment!
she would be laughed out of the
office.

In arty event, “each year, the
Defense Department inadvertently
pays contractors hundreds or iiiii.
lions ofdollars that it does not owe
thcm[$750 million,accordingrorhe

GAO], and much of the money is
never returned." So what do we do
when these behemoths merge? Easy-
Give them more moneyl In 1995,
Martin Marietta and Lockheed
merged, so the DOD gave the exec«

Yes, that’s right:The executiveswere
given $31 million by the DOD for
becoming even more monopolistic.

Augustine pocketed $8.2 million,

result orthe merger, the new compa—

As social welfare programs are
cut, military spending continues to
grow The Clinton administration
plans to increase military spending
by 47% between 1996 and 2001, So
much for the peace dividend. Of
course, gutting programs for the poor.
and thus making them more willing
employees at awful wages and with
no benefits, is precisely the idea, the
flip side ofgiving massive amounts of
money to the already very rich
through defense spending.

Military spending forces a do.
mestic policy restructuring from pro
grams of social uplift. Utilizing the
specious canard of the need for a
balanced budget, the plutocrats viti-
ate environmental standards and
eviscerate worker's rights, salaries,
and safety nets. The budget deficit
itself also directly enriches the very
rich: In 1994, for example, the US
paid over$ZZO billion in interest on
the debt. More than 80% of that goes
to already wealthy US Citizensl This
is not an accident. not a failure in US
policy. This is the calculated effect of
a refractory US military budget.

No matter how you slice itiaid
for dependent corporations or spend»
ing sieve to kill programs for the
pooriUS military spending is a cal.
culated part of the New World Or»
der, by and for the rich.

we lost the wonder Bread account."
Draw this out for more laughs and
“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhlih"s.
