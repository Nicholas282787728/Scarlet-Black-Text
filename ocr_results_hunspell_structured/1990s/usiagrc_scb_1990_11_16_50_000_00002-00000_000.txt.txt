By Jessica Weisel

Grinnell's sponsorship of a Des
Moines elementaryeschool Class as
part of the “1 Have a Dream" pro
gram wasthesubjcctoltt feature on
CBS This Morning: Wednesday
broadcast. 'ilarry Smith, cohost or
the show, conducted satellite inter-
views with Frank Thom-us, a Grin.
ncll alumnus and the head of the
program, lumnol Muhammcd, one
of the program’s “Dreamers" and
John Lopos, a Grtnnell senior,

The "I Have h Dream" program
begun ntne years ago when New
York busmcssmtirt Eugene Lang
promised to pay for the college
education of a class of New York
elemenuiryrschool students if they
completed high school. Following
his promise, a nationwide organi-
zation was started to provide a
college education and academic
supper; [Rebatrnsk students in an
effort to keep them in school. Cur-
rently there are 139 such programs
in 40 states. last year, Gnnnell
became the ﬁrst college or univer
sity to sponsor a class, when it an-
nounced that it would support a
class of,47 students from Moulton
Elementary School. Smith asked
why the college became involved.

”I think essentially Grinnoll was
interestcdin makingsurethatitwas
involved in the education of the
youth of this country," answered
Thomas. f‘George Drake, the [col-
lege] president, expressed it very

well Ihatwe’re indttngerofbecom-
ing two socleues; those with edu-
cation and those without.”

Thomas explained Llittt the col-
lege provides the students with
uCLidelC and emotional support.
He claimed that there is it lot of
stress in the society in which the
“Dreamers” live.

Smith then asked Muhammed
about the program, about his goals
and whttt he had learned.
Milhammed, who has graduated
from Moulton,said thathehopes to
become a judge by gomg to law
school. From visiting Grtnnell, he
snid that “college looks kind of
hard.” He said that the students
have a lot of books. prompting the
comment from Smith, “They do
have a lot of books and if you‘re
geing to go to law school, you‘re
going to see a lot more books than
that.“

Because Grinnell is a college, it
attempts to introduce the Dreamers
to the campus. In recentwecks, the
Des Moines students have partici-
pated in seminars with professors
and have met with college volun-
teers. Lopos said that the Dream-
ers “can see what college life, at
least the Student life, IS like on
campus. . . .They can also see that
the [college] students are notsupcr~
human rind intangible."

Lopos said he became involved
after “soulrscarchingf’ He de—
scribed it asan opportunity“tostart
giving something back,”

Town of Grinnell Profiled in New Book

Grtnnell is one of 15 American
small towns featured in Thomas
Rawls' new book,SmallPlacer: In
Search ofa Vanishing America.

Published by Little, Brown, and
C0,, Small Placer examines “the
traditions, sense of community,
isolation, and lack of opportunity”
that Rawls says have characterized
the history of American small
towns. While Grtnnell and other
smalleoinmunitiesarcplnnningfot
the future and “holding their own"
economically, many small towns
have vanished from the American
landscape.

The book profiles towns from
all regions of the U S , including
Kcuka Lake, N.Y.; Lynchburg,
Tenn; Palmer, Alaska; and Dott,
Penn.

Rnwls’ profile of Grtnnell fo—
cuses on what he calls the “sturdy
triangulation that has Lrussed up
small-town America for more thtin
a century; education (the college),
opportunity (u land of unbroken
sod, with its topsoil measured in

feet, not inches), and religion.” He
interviews Sharp Lannom. head of
Grinnell»based DeLong Sports-
wear, rintl examines the goals of
Grinnell 2000, a nonprofit, grass-
roots organization designed to help
Grinnell prepare for the future.
Much of the Grinnell profile
deals with comments made during
a symposium on small~town
America held at Grtnnell College
tn 1987. With a keynote speech by
author Tom Wolfe. the conference

on the great men and women who

Rawls concludes that small

because they‘ve produced great
leaders, but also because “they are
