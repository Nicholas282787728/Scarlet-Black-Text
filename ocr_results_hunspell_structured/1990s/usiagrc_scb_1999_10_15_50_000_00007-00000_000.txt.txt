Shelton brings life back into Grinnell music scene

By Mat Mart

When Garrett Shelton came to Grin-
nell from boarding school, he jumped at
the chance to be a KDIC D]. And that
was before they told him he would get
paid. “I’m gonna get paid to listen [0 jazz?
That was the last
thing I Said in [lie in»
r'eryiew." said
Shelton.

Two years later
Shelton, now music
director at KDlC, is
changing the face of
Grinnell college ia-
din Tlimugli a new
rotation system,
Shelton knows that
there will be some
constancy on the air,
but also a good vari-
ety oFtypcs of music
Will be played. ”We’ll
play what's good," Shelton said.

When Shelton ﬁrst joined die KDIC
staffhe saw a place with “so many areas to
work on . . . A radio station cannot exist
wuli money alone. What is the point or

putting your heart and soul into something
no one listens to?” Shelton asked.

Overall it was a low time for the cam-

pus music scene, he said. As Shelton wants

music to be more ore part preempue life

in general, he worked on music projects

besides KDIC.

“Its a small came
pus, but people were disconnected,” he
said. “Weiiist want musicians on campus
to connect to cach other."

Eventually Shelton would like to see a
self-perpetuating music scene that is strong

enough to draw students
here.

KDIC
Freesound have taken
away from Shelton’s
own time to play, but he
doesn’t mind. “I like
helping people create
music,” he said.

For many on the
KDIC staff he has
served as an inspiration.

jazz show when we first met, It's impor-
tant to have a good variety . . . a lot of
college radio doesn’t do that.”
Many of the changes that Shelton has
brought ro KDIC this year were ideas he
picked up from his summer internship
with VERVE (a jazz label). For ten weeks
he learned about how the record industry

works from behind the scenes.

The internship also gave him e glimpse
at s possible proression. Shelton sees him-
selfwotkjng to find new ways to market
lszz.

“Jazz is my ﬁrst love, it always will be,”
Shelton said. “Major labels can’t market
jazz the way it needs to be. Jazz is a revolu-
tionary music and it needs to made avail—
able to the people in new ways."
