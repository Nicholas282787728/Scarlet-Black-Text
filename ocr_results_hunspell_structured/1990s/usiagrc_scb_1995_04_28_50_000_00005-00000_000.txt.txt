THU WEEK AT THE MOVIE HOUIB
By ELEANOR DODSON & TAYLOR WYMAN

Staff Movie Reviewers
Eleanor‘s View—

Bye, love tries to be an adult
comedy about divorce and its hn
gering affects on families. The

problem is that it‘s not funny and it has
very little to say about divorce on any
level. lrtstead,itwintlsupasappy afﬁn'nzi—
tion ofloving each other the best we can.

Bye Bye, lnve tries to create acom-
posite portrait oftlivorcc by weaving SIO-
rics about three afﬂuent, attractive while
men and their problems with their ox-
wives, their children and their new girls
friends. As the thine men, Matthew
Modine is bland, Paul Rois-er is plomts‘r
ing, and Randy Quaid starts good but
loses it under nn avalanche of mean
spirited grimaces. Theie's also a dopey

Taylor’s View

5 ﬁlm really was nght in the
middle; it had strong [ﬁlms and
weak ones. I

enjoyed watching it but it certainly could

havemenbcuer. ByeByeIJJt/e wasabout
three divorced buddies dealing with their
lives, children and exewives. Most ofthe
movie‘s Situations are ﬁlled with a biuer
humor, and quick sharp dialogue remi-
niscent of Paul Reiser’s work on Mad
Abortr You . Some scenes evoked my
empathy for the suess and pain of their
lives, while other scenes came across as
entirely hokey and intended only for the
creation or warm fuzzies: especially die
end.

The acting and direction didn’tstand
out positively or negatively to me. Overr
iill,cvcrythingwas merely adequate, with
the excepLion orRandy Quaid's acting. i
will recommend this one for a video
rental: it was pleasant but not of aqualiry
that you should rush out and see it ﬁrst
chance you get. As anasidc to the option
of going to the movies, I will throw in a
shameless plug for the Debating Union’s

Where did this ﬁlm come from?
We’d never heard of it, so we were
surprised when the video store had it.
Forrest Gump? Sounds like a tree
