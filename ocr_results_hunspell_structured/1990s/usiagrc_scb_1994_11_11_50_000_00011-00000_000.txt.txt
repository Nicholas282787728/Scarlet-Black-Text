of 28-21 .

“It was a tough loss,“ stated
Grinnell head coach Greg Wallace.
“We really wanted to have a wine
ning record, and to lose those last
two games in the last two minutes is
tough.”

After Illinois College opened
the scoring, the Pioneers came back
with two touchdowns of their own.

from a rush by seniorco-capiain Ian
Shoemaker.

In the third quarter, Illinois Col-
lege cameback with two touchdowns
off of Pioneer turnovers, putting the
score at 20-14. Grinnell responded,
reclaiming the lead 21-20, but lC

cap a scoring drive which won the
game for the Blue Boys.

The Pioneers were led by 245
yards passin g from Dougherty. Shoe

ﬁve catches for 96 yards Said
Wallace, “we were worried because

Kafcle Hodari was injured, but we
had a great passing game, especially
considering the bad weather." In the
rainy and slick conditions, the
Grinnell ground game was led by
freshman Jim Hart with 56 yards on
12 carries.

The loss brought the gridders
record to 4-5, This was, though. a
great improvement over the 079
records of the last two years.

Coach Wallace had nothing but
praise for his team‘s performance
over the season, including a much
improved offense. “We relied on the
running gameearly on,"commentcd
Wallace. “but we ended the season
with four receivers in the top ﬁfteen
in theeonference." The passing game
picked up after injuries to key rush-
ers Shoemaker and sophomore Jar
son Werner.

Wallace alsopraised his defense.
The Coach speciﬁcally mentioned
the defensive performances against
Coe, Cornell and Knox.

Wallace has mostof his starters
returning next year and with that and
whathecalls“thebestcoaching staff"
he has ever had, hopes to have yet
another very successful season next
year,
