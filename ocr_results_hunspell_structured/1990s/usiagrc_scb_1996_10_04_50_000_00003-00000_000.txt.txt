Scarlet or Black - Friday, October 4, 1996

BY TREVOR PORATH

Last Friday, Rupin and t mei with the Board of
Trustees to discuss the goals of this year‘s Student
Government Association. As we prepared our pre
sentation, we realized that every goal was related
to increasing communication between different sec-
tors of campus: between student groups, students
and the administration, students and the faculty, and
students and the Trustees.

After ourcampaigns last spring,
Rupin and I agreed that SGA
needed to address communication
gaps on campus. However, it
wasn‘t until we both took ofﬁce in
August serving as liaisons between
all of the aforementioned groups
that the extent of the communica-
tion gaps became apparent; nearly
every issue that SGA is Working
with this year involves either a
break down in communication or
general lack of understanding be-
tween groups. While we understand that SGA carts
not solve every problem by simply getting people
to talk more freely, we believe that opening come
munication will increase our ability to efﬁciently
foster positive changes at Grinnell this year and in
future years. _

As SGA Vice Resident/President of Academic
Affairs. one of my primary responsibilities is to
voice students‘ curricular concerns to the faculty
and its Dean. Students can either VAX me directly
at [SGA] or by talking to one of their Student Edue
cational Policy Committee members. Each departs
mental SEPC is composed of majors from within
its department and acts as a liaison between the
department‘s faculty and students, Every SEPC is

represented on the Student Council on Curriculum.
chaired by the SGA VP/PAA. A11 concerns brought
to SEPC members are discussed with the
department‘s faculty and the SCC.

Currently the SCC is exploring the idea of ac-
knowledging the lab component of lab courses on
students‘ transcripts. Students who suggested this
idea fear that they may be at a disadvantage when
applying for research grants,jobs,
graduate programs, and internships
when competing with students
from colleges and universities that
officially list labs. While students
who raised this concern three years
ago were not able to create changes,
the large amount of discussion that
lab listings has generated this year
indicates that it is still an imponant
concern of a large part of the stue
dent body.

Diversifying Gnnnell‘s curricu-
lum with respect to multi-cultural
and multi»ethnic issues is another area that the SCC
and individual SEPCs will be working with this year.
There are also faculty committee‘s with student repe
rcsentation whose sole task is to explore curriwr
lum diversiﬁcation.

In previous years, student have become discourr
aged because change did not occur quickly. How»
ever, even though some changes have not material-
ized, students must continue to pursue these con»
cems. Students at an institution that highly respects
its students and their interests, can to affect change
if we persistently work within the already estab
lished channels. I encourage all students to voice
any curricular concern to members of their depanr
mental SEPCs. ' *

BY TOM TAYLOR
REPORTER

Upon entering the Pub or State Street
on any night of the week, one encoun-
ters a smoky, subterranean world inhabr
ited by students and residents of Grins
hell but almost always entirely devoid
of professors It is a curious situation.
One pauses and thinks “Surely my pro-
fessors, like me, imbibe some beer or
spirits from time to time. But where are
they? I do not see them here."

Likewise, one would guess that ev-
ery now and then 2i professor relaxing at
home or at faculty house, enjoying the
company of family, friends or other pr0r
fessors, must stop and wonder “Those
curious students. How do they spend
their time? Are they more interesting
than they appear to be in class?"

Sadly enough, the student and the
professor are usually jolted out of their
respective reveries by the smack of the
pool cue or an interesting comment and
the train of thought rolls no further,

To be sure, Grinnell suffers from a

lack of social interactions between stu-
dents and iaeuity While professors here
are extremely accesible, contact wnh 51w
dents outside of the classroom or office
is limited by a number of factors. The
forum offers a chance to say hello and
chat for a minute or two but good con-
versations are hardly ever made over big
cookies. Lectures. concerts and films
provide another forum for socializing but
here the focus is decidedly on the event
itself.

Perhaps the main barrier to increased
contact is the fact that, for many, socialr

' izing and conversation are best pursued

over a beer or zi refreshing drink. Un»
fortunately, the college maintains a
policy which strongly discourages drink~
ing among faculty and students.

In some respects, this policy is justir
fied. In today‘s hyper-sensitive climate,
it could be argued thatthere is something
in the act of having a drink with a stu-
dent tliat is in itself compromising. Ade
diticnally, there is the mystique lhat sure
rounds professors, a natural consequence
of the professor—student relationship,

which is perhaps best left undisturbed.

Students also have reasons not to be
too concerned about the policy. It is
comforting to be able to escape the
world of academic responsibilities, to
separate one‘s life as a student from .
one’s life as an adolescent. More imr
portantly, the prospect of encountering
a professor at the Pub in the midst of a
Dionysian binge is unwelcome to any
student. especially one who is underage.

These considerations are valid, per
haps, but they serve only to widen the
divide between the two elements of the
Grinncll community who are here'prer
cisely because they want to interact with
and learn from each other. If profes-
sors and students were able to talk over
a beer at the pub or a glass of wine at
dinner without feeling guilty, it could
only encourage a moderated attitude [be
wards drinking among students and to—
wards socializing among the faculty.
Most importantly, it would bring Grin-
nell closer to the conception ofcommu-
nity_ towards which the campus has al-
ways worked.
