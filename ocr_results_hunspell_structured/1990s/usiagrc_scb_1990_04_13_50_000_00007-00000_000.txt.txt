The

spurred a number of journalists to
(question conservatism’s future in
‘America. Time magazine ran an
gessay which asserted that with the
Soviet empire withering away,
'conscrvatives no longer had a
runiting goal toward which to
‘Slruggle. Their doctrine, the
reasoning went, was therefore
“becoming obsolete. Editorialists in
tthe major newspapers agreed.
This analysis assumes that the

i ln the wake of some genuinely
_startling and unexpected reforms,

By Mike Washbum

the Western
media fell
quickly in love
with Mikhail Gorbachev. It has
rendered a glowing picture of him
in which the tram of a peacemaker,
reformer; and brilliant smtesman
are highlighted. Consider his
selection as Time’s “Man of the
Decade." To quote from Time.
“Gorbachev is ahero...he gave new
luster to the great-man theory...he
has made possible the end of the
cold war." Recent United States
presidentscouldonlydreamofsuch
lavish praise. “Gorby” has grown
so popular that one would not be
greatly surprised by the sudden
appearance of t-shirts displaying
his mug.

But our media‘s enthusiasm for
Gorbachev contrasts dramatically
with the feelings of people who
have experienced the ruler’s
inﬂuence firsthand. As Russian
tanks crawl through Vilnius, where
the streets are littered with fliers
demanding a return to Soviet rule,
and where the Russian military
forced its way into a hospital to
arrest and beat defecting soldiers,

racing Facts Curiouser and ﬂurinser

The Bitter and the Sweet

1 was walking down West 4th
street in New York a while back
and a street vendorcameover to me
and asked me it I wanted to buy a
widget. He told me that it was not
only a widget made with American
widge, but that it was also cheaper
than any widget I‘d ﬁnd any where
else.

As a man who enjoys a good
widgetnowandagain,butwhohas
been watching my widgeintake for
health reasons, I asked curiously,
“Why is this widget better then all
other widgets?”

The friendly merchant pro-
ceeded to tell me that the reason
was price, and that “I should be
thankful that I live in a country
which both subsidizes American
widgeandkecpsahighwidgetariff
in placeso that I have no choice but
to buy fine American widge prod
ucts."

“Where does the government get
the money?" I inquired.
“Taxes," the fellow responded
with a gleam in his eye.
Then I became more puzzled for
I thought that those were likely my
taxes which were going into the
American widge industry, and
thereforel was only paying for my
widge products in installments.

“Not so,” the vendor replied,
“because of Government subsidim

Thatcher's Rotten Flagship

,GREAT BRITAIN Margaret Thatcher described it
as the ﬂagship of her third term in ofﬁce. Eighty
‘percent ofthe population hates both it and her. Half
'a million people in Scotland have already refused to
‘pay it. And as it travels south of the border into
England and Wales. hundreds of thousands have
’dcmonstraled against it, and thousands more have
.rioted. It truly seems as if the Community Charge, or
’-“poll tax," has become what one Conservative mcmr
ber of Parliament warned would be a “political cya-
"nidc pill”.
. This is no more
_orlessthanThatcher
deserves. The rcr
'placemcnt of the
.rates, property taxes
which pay for local
(services. with the
—poll Lax, which is a
(ﬂat levy on every non-unemployed person over the
age of 18, regardless of income or property owner-
*ship, is something that few would have thought pos—
,sible in a modem society. And it would be sweet
justice indeed if the one Conservative cabinet minis-
‘tcr. who had the guts to stand up to her and tell her she
was wrong, were to push her out of the party leader
,ship, That man is Michael Heseltine, who until his
TF‘UDnalinl’i from the cabinetin1986 had servcdas En-
‘Vironincnt Secreme (with responsibility for local
government), and then Defense Secretary.
,, But that would only be swcctjusticc on Thatcher.
The Conservative Party deserves punishmentjust as
’muehnsshcdoes. Forthefailurc ofBritaintocompctc
mnd keep up with the rest of Europe, the cuts in
,cducation and health, the poor training of the
workforce, and now the poll tax are all just as much
'tlieu responsibility as hers, Bccause instead ofseeing
.what was right, they saw only their infallible leader.

Humiliation at the nextelection is the only proper way
ofpunishing the“dead sheep.” “wets,” and others who
make up the bulk of the parliamentary Conservative

INDIA For months there has been a slate of high

tension in the Indian province of Kashmir, where the
predominantly Muslim population feels at the very
least somewhat out ofplace in a predominantly Hindu
nation. A radical separatist movement has waged a
warofterrorism against the provincial administration.
Meanwhile ultra~conr
servativc Hindus in
Dehli are baying for
blood. leaving Prime
Minister V.P.Singh

neuver. Butfew were
prrpared for things to
take a turn towards
war between India and Pakistan.

Yet this is the situation with which we are faced
following a week in which first Pakistan spoke out in
support of the Muslims of Kashmir and then India
mobilized its forces and Singh told his people to
“prepare for war." It is a sobering thought, when one
considers that both these heavily armed and economi-
cally strong countries have probable access to nuclear
weapons and could well be able to stand a war of
attrition. no matter how many people are prepared to
mediate between then. But what is even more frightr
ening is that a supposedly moderate lndian Prime
Minister could behave so rashly.

One wonders also when, or if. there will ever be a
lasting soiution to the problem of religious minorities

any other people in the world.”

“But what about the fact that I
make more then any other worker
in the worldl?! Isn‘t that the reason
it’s a lower percentage?" 1 ex-
claimed ln horror clinging to no-
tions of good old American fair
play. “What aboutLatin and South
American widge makers, who are
deprived of the American market.”

Now the merchant was becomr
ingclearlyangry with meand stared
mcrightin the eyeandaskod,“Son.
are you an American?"

“Yes,“ I responded. alittlc fright-
ened by the turn the conversation
had taken, “But. aren‘t we Ameri—
cans opposed to tariffs and all that?
Isn't that what the whole argument
with Japan is about?"

”That’s about rice and cars and
stuff. Itjustisn'tthesameas widge.
Widge is an American thing, like
apple pie, baseball, and broccoli.
Well.... maybe not broccoli," he

said after thinking a minute. “And
don’tgo and throw thewidgeiobby
in my face!!!” he added.

“There's a widge lobby?" I
asked. I mean I‘d always seen
commercials for widgeproductson
TV,butI’d neverﬁgurtdonalobby.

“There you go! Ofcoursc there’s

a widge lobby, to protect the rights

of American widge workers and

manufacturers. It’s like lobbying

to protect our right to own guns! "
“It is?" I asked suspiciously.

“Look, are you going to buy
widge products,and supportAmerir
can workers or not?" he asked in a
cold voice.

“I would, but that just doesn‘t
sound fair," and,at thatmoment, he
stormed off in a huff.

Swelled with a new sense of
pride at my defense of the rights of
workers and the free market system
and the fortitude I had shown in my
boycott of imperialist widges, I
pulled outmy can ofpop, andsuck-
ing it down proceeded to enjoy a
candy bar.

At least the sugar was still pure.
