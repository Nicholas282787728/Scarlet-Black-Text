September 20, 1919: A revision of the college’s dormitory
system foreshadows Grinnell's self—govemance policy. The S&B
reports that the dormitories were to include faculty residents who
would “have no responsibility for the conduct of the men in the
dormitory and are in the dormitories only for the friendly associ—
ation with the students."

September 23, 1936: The 8&3 reports that student wages rise
to 32 cents an hour. The college also designates a committee to
later evaluate worker efficiency and determine whether students
should receive an extra three to six cents an hour.

September 24, 1943: President Stevens of Grinnell College
reﬂects upon the recent visit of President Harry S. Truman. Dr.
Stevens, when questioned by the SSLB staff about his prestigious
train ride widi the President, responded, "Why, lhave known Mr.
Truman for some time."

September 17, 1965: The SSLB runs a “kinsey—like” sex survey
in which 61% of the Grinnell women surveyed said their attitudes
on sex became more liberal since coming to college (23% reported
having engaged in sexual intercourse). Among the reasons these
women loosened their values were: “influences of people with
whom they associate change in frequency of contact with mem—
bers of the opposite sex...change in biological drives...effects of
formal education..."

September 19, 1975: The front page of the 5&B anticipates
the arrival of Bruce Springsteen with a review of "Born to Run".
The reviewer writes that "one must View skeptically a new release
by an artist who is being hailed as a great by such commercially»
oriented magazines as Billboard..." etc. The revrewer speculates
that “the quality of the artist’s recordings generally begins to
decline" when an artist goes popular.

Students complain
aborgstyrofoam use

The Forum’s use of disposable
items this year has stirred environ—
mental controversy on campus.

In past years, the Forum Grill
supplied reusable eating wares But
as part of this year’s renovations, the
venue hasswitched to sryrofoam cups,
paper plates, and plastic cutlery.
Grinncll’s Envrronmenral Action
Group sees the change as a step back
wards in ecological responsibility.

"Our main objections are: ntlmr
bet one, the use of CFC's [in the
production of Styrofoam] and num—
berrwo,thedisposabllityofthecups,"
said EAG spokesperson Laurel Dick
’97. “We’re mainly concerned for
the ozone layer and excess waste."
The group also objects to the use of
disposableitemsbecauseoftheircon»
tribution to the glut ofsolid waste.

Dining Services Director Dave
McConnell says, “We switched in
large part to become more user—friend—
ly. One criticism we‘ve suffered with
in the past few years is that people
had to make a $2 deposit for the
cups.“ In the past, the forum used
reusable mugs and took deposits to

Last year, then 1(ch program.
ming director James Onwuachi ‘95
stated that, in the ‘80's and early
‘90‘s, the campus radio station was
“like a Fisher—Price toy." KDIC has
come a long way since then, and one
of the proofs of that evolution last
year was For Your Information. a
weekly, half—hour long news maga<
zine headed by Assistant News Di—
rector ]ill Erickson ’98.

Though FY I was plagued by a
small budget and staff, it still man—
aged to turnoutsoine interesting and
thoughrrprovoking reporting. This
year, the show can boast of two new
reportetsiLuke Beschra '98 and
Tequia Burr ’98. This, hopefully,
will take some of the pressure to
produce off the old staff members
and allow for more concentration on
content and quality. Erickson is very
optimistic about this year, saying “I
think the staffis pretty open to doing
newkindsofstories.We can take FYI
anywhere."

The show wrll head in a couple
of new directions. “We’re going to
start doing public servicertype ‘info—
mercials'. An example would be
maybe profiling a campus or commur
nity organization that has an upcomc
ing event,” said Erickson. She add—
ed, “Personally, I‘d really like to in—
volve the offrcampus community as
much as possible."

Another new initiative will be

discourage theft, “The trend shows
that people want a grabrandrgo type
of environmentithey don’t have
timetoreturnrhecups. We’rertying
to make the Forum more accommo»
dating."

The EAG does not consider this
a good solution. Ben Stallings '98, a
member of the group, says that the
EAG will try ropersuade Dining Ser—
Vices to switch back to the old at»
rangement: “Someonesuggesred boyr
cotting the grill, but that would be
totally ineffective. We're planning
to talk to Dining Services." If the
strategyofrationalpersuasiondoesn’r
work, Stallings says that the group is
"thinking ofa petition" to show the
campus’ agreement with EAG.

NELEDITOR

on Wednesday, September 13,
Grinnell‘s Students in Defense of
Animals and the Environment
(SDAE) broughtDr AndrewNichol»
son, MD, to campus for two talks,
the first on “Ethical Issues Confront-
ing Doctors Today" and the second
on “Health and Vegetarianism." Dr,
Nicholson is Director of Preventive
Medicine at the Washington based
non—profitPhysicinttsCommirtee for
Responsible Medicine.

Nicholson‘s first talk criticized
the present medical establishment
for its focus on fast ”bullet" cures.
Nicholson charged that the classical
“ear1y»dctection and treatment"
model currently used in medical prac»
tice has failed. He argued that chronic
degenerative diseases have reached
epidemic proportions and that the
present medical structure |S no long
er economically viable. Dr. Nichol<
son sees part of the solution as a shift
towards preventive medicine, that is

afocus on cliungingdier and lifestyle
it) improve health. In particular
Nicholson advocates a vegetarian or
vegan (no meat, dairy, or eggs) diet,
In his second talk, he showed how
veganandvegetariandiershavebeeii
proyon to drastically reduce the risk
of heart disease. stroke, and some
types of cancer. Dr. Nicholson also
addressed the many other health ben»
efits ofthese diets.

Aaron Gross '96, SDAE Presi»
dent. explained that SDAE wants
people to be aware that “vegetarian—
ism and veganism aren't only better
for the animals and the enVironrnenr,
they are better for people too."
Nicholson explained that there is no
arguing with the superior health ofa
vegetarian or especially a vegan diet.
Gross adds, ”SDAE addresses a lot of
controveisial issiies,,,He:ilrh and a
strong health care system is some
thing we are all concerned with."
According to Nicholson these conr
cerns should lead us to remove or
reduce animal products in our diet.
