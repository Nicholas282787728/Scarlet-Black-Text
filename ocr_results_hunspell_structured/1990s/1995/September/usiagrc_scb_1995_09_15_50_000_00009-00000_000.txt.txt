In the Coffee?

BY DAN BUE'lTNER

I remember yiVidly the day last
summer when 0.]. Simpson em—
barked on his Journey over the Los
Angeles freeways, and I also reinein—
her my initial reaction (0 the white
Bronco's mysterious \Voyzigcil got
up and turned the TV off, Some four
hours later, I drove over to a friend’s
house for SOInCEhlhg or other, and
was inildlysurprised to see his entire
fainilysitting aroiindrheTanatclr
ing the drama unfold. I had heard of
the murders,ofcoiirse,butSimpson‘s
guilt or innocence, and his pathetic
attempt toescape rhe law,seemedall
but interesting, both at the time and
now,

Even then, however, America
was fascinated by the melodrama
which began unfolding last sum-
merimyfriend’sfamilywatclietlthe
car chase, or whatever ir was, for
several more hours. I lost interest
almost immediately. Frankly, i don’i
Careone\vayorihcolher\vhcthorhc
is guiltyor not, oreven whetherlic is
acquitted ar not. What i do care
about is iire farce that his trial has
become

in all honesty, reading the nae
dia coverage of ihis judicial circus
makes me nauseous. Even respecrr
able papers like the New York Times
devoteuptoahalfapagetoSimpson
trialupdatesalmostdaily—andthese
updates involve such earth-shatterr
ing testimony as the behaViorofconr

mon Objecls in cold weather, thi:
stitching patterns of Singer scwmg
machines. and ivhethet or not Simp—
son has been takinghis arthritis inedr
ication. The conduct of both the
prosecutors and the defense lawyers
has only contributed to the fashion«
ing of what is, essentially, a circus,
the details of which we are constant-
ly bombarded With.

ln ariicles on the trial this suinr
mer, it somehow became fashionable
to refer to it as “the trial of the cen»
tury," as ifit was somehow important
in the grand scheme ofihings Aer»
icon. The truth ofthe matter is that
thetrial,orrathertheoutcomeofthe
trial, is absoluiely meaningless. No
legal precedents will have been set,
no turning point in judicial history
will have been reached, no average
American will have his or her life
affected in any way,

To refer to the Simpson trial as
“the trial of the century" is to do a
great disservice ra [he truly impar.
taiit legal battlesofthe 20th century.
among them Brown v BoardofEdur
Cation, Miranda, Roe v, Wade, and
the Scopes monkey trial. Every one
oi these cases has had lasting taper»
cussions on the way Americans con—
duct their daily business. Cases like
these haveclefined many- ofthe rights
of modern Americans, whether it is
the right to attend a decent school,
to be free from unreasonable search
and seizure, to have your rights read
to you upon arrest, to have a lawyer
presentduringquestioning,orawom»
an’s right to control her own body.
The Simpson trial has nothing on

ilrese cases; it is merely media sensar
tionalisin at its worst.

An interesting question, then,
is why this farce has been afforded
such attention. Consideringthat, in
thespaceoininemonthsorso,Susan
Smith committed hercriine, and was
jailed, tried, conwczed and sen—
tenced, as well as the fact that Smith
was a relative nobody, I can only
attribute it to sensationﬂllsmifooia
ball great not so great after all, etc.
Why is America so enthralled by its
public figures and their misdeeds?
But that’s another subject entirely.

The one thing that the Simpson
trial has done that might conceiv—
ably do any good at all is show Amen
ica how sick and LWisted its legal
system has become. The trial has
wasted thousands, if not hundreds of
thousands, oftaxpayer's dollars, and
has shown that a one/lime national
celebritywho,accordingto allofrhe
evidence, is probably guilty, cansrill,
literally, get away with murder in this
Country It has shown us what utter
nonsense our own criminal justice
system is capable of,

So the next time you’re reading

Commentary ' 9

a Simpson trial update, don't just
read itilhlnk about how ridiculous
itall is, and think aboutwhy it is that
such a matter-ofrcourse thing as a
murder trial can end up dominating
America‘s attention span like this
one has. Also think about what the
trial would have been like if the do
fendant were an African»American
teenage gang member from thestreets
of LA.

All I can think is that it would
have been over in two weeks.
