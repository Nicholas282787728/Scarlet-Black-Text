Stinky Beasts

They‘re the first campus band to
promote tantric meditation, the first
band to claim to have not one but
two bodhlsattvas as members. Yes,
they’re Stinky Beasts and they may
convert Grinnell College to Bud<
dhisrn through their music.

To work down the path towards
enlightenment, the band plays sew
ml Eastern instruments. Senior
Xander Jacobs, or as he chooses to

, call himself, achild ofthe Sesquicem

tennial, plays a Chinese spike fiddle.
One of the band members, who chose
to be called Slippere»X, bangs on a
“tantric hittin‘ thing," basically a
small drum. Junior Jason Browning
is now on the organ. Hrs old instru—
ment,the deirdredu,“Wasreclaimed

ing.

Their inﬂuences are Lao Tzu
and Buddhist monks. People used to
play music like theirs “to help learn
oldscriptures." Duringthe interview
I asked them who their role models
were, and all they could say was,
“suddenly all attention turned to the
wasp flying by thelrght.” Wirhrhings
like wasps to contemplate, I guess

they don't need role models.

The band claims to have had
extensrve religious experiences. “All
of us have become bodhisattvas for a
time while playing, except Xander.”
Slippere—X elaborates, “Being a bo—
dhitsattva is one of the stages a per»
son must pass through to enlighten—
ment.” Although the band is trying
to spread the truths of Buddhism
through music, Xander says “We try
not to be pretentious; we're not look»
ing (or followers."

Different members provide dlft
ferent explanations of their music.
Xander said “It‘s like a ride on the
tantric roller coaster.“ Browning be»
gan wrth apositive description of the
band; “We’re like James Joyce on
guitar.” But he went on to describe
their sound in a excessively visual
metaphor; “Imagine mbbing fresh
shM all over your naked body and
the smell that music would make."

Considering Browning’s descrip—
tion of their music, the name Stinky
Beasts aptly fits.

The band attempted to help me
feel my awakening at the end ofthe
interview through a few unearthly
organ chords. \X/hile rhe music can
only be described as wildly melodic
screeching, I felt none of the calling
they claim to have heard.

Xander admitted that not ev—
eryone could feel their message:
“We're trying to lead people into the
light but trying to keep ﬂies away."
Guess this reporter must just be a ﬂy.

Beast members assert they have
been together “ever since theirsouls
began traveling through Samskara."
Last spring the Beasts began practic—
ing as a band because they “realized
their dharma and came together on
earth."

Concerts occur wherever and
whenevertheTaopointsforthemto
play.

Stinky Beasts is essentially a
much better way to be introduced to
Buddhism than the intro to Eastern
religion class on campus.

consequences of those labels in hue

towards a conclusion that resists
