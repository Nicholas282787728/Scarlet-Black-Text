Grinnell guitarist records new CD

Grinnell bard Arlo Leach’s de<
but CD is a rich dollop ofhomemade
acoustic pop, topping off a musical
careeratGrinnell that included stints
in the campus bands Liquid Pearl.
Half Empty, and, most recently, Arlo
and the Jammin’ Salmon.

Leach, who graduated last fall.
hopes that the foursong CD, entir
tled Flying, will also serve as the base
ingredient for a still»to-come musi»
cal career. Leach recently relocated
to Madison, Wisconsin. and plans to
use the CD, he said, “mainly as a
demo" to promote himself to places
where he wants to play.

Flyingwas recorded over the ‘94.
'95 school year for free at Grinnell’s
own electronic music studio in the
Fine Arts building. Arlo was an
English major, and it was his first
experience with producing: “I basi—
cally figured it out as l went along,"
he said, "I totally indulged myself

and did like a hundred takes of
things.”

That dedication shows through
on the CD, which doesn’t sound to
myearatall like anovioe’satrernprar
production. The four offerings on
Flying are solidly performed, if not
groundbreaking,songsaboutloveand
relationships

The CD grew out of a body of
twenty or thirtysongs that Arlo wrote
during the summer before his senior
year Arlo said he chose rhese four
songs, titled “Cherry Necklace",
“Icams”, “Star”, and “Flying”, be»
cause “1 tend to be very conservative
about what 1 record. They‘re sort of
lowest common denominator stuffi
they’re nothing too weird." Afterall.
the CD exists to promote himself to
bookers at clubs, coffeehouses, and
colleges—he needs tosound market»

able.

Still, Flying is worth a listen.
Arlo’s lyrics on the disc are almost
always clever and intriguing—he says
"I hope that they [the songs] would
be seen as relationship songs, but not

Nine Months is all about cast.
Maybe Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubt<
fire, Home Alone): who wrote the
American version of the script (based
on the French film, NeufMois) and
directed it, was hoping that if he
assembled a strong enough cast, no
one would notice (orcare) that there
are no characters in this film, just a
collection of ridiculous stereotypes,

With Hugh Grant, the hot actor
of the moment, and Julianne Moore,
one of the most talented actresses
around today, the lead couple is in—
deed attractive, though ﬂat. Tom
Arnold and Joan Cusack have both
proven their comedic skills in previ—
ous films,butasanenthusiastic breed—
er couple, come across here as merely

oafish. Even sure—fire funnyman Rob»
in Williams falls ﬂat with a cartoon
ishly stereotyped portrayal of a re—
cent Russian immigrant. Only Jeff
Goldblum manages to hold his own
as a swariny, aging artist playboy.

Columbus’s portrayal of mid-
die—class pregnancy in America is
embarrassing at best. Pregnancy here
is viewed from a male perspective.
Women are viewed as either nurtur—
ing matrons or as predators. Julianne
Moore is forced into both roles, in—
eluding a disturbing scene where she
turns into a giant preying menus and
devours Hugh Grant.

A lot of publicity was dedicated
to Nine Months as Grant’s attempt
to convert his demand in England to
a comparable status in America. If
he‘s serious about his conquest, he
needs to be more careful about the
roles he takes. His usual schtick as a
befuddled charmer in over his head is
swamped in Nine Months by the

as typical relationship songs. 1 like to
think that they’re a little bit more
intelligent."Theguitarworkishooky

several competent backing musicians:
Dari Sharpe ‘95, on Congas, David
Groppe ‘97, on Congas and guiro,
Johnathan Kissam ‘95, on backing
guirar, and Aaron Kassover ‘96, on
electric and acoustic bass.

Both Groppe and Kassover are

and Arlo does not intend to stay a
solo musician for long. He moved to
Madison partly because of its good
music scene, and, afterjust a couple
weeks there, he’s already formed a
threeepiece and played a gig. But he
said he still hasn‘t found the perfect
group. ideally, Arlo hopes to form
“both a loud rock band, like Half
Empty,and an acousticrhinglikethe
Jammin’ Salmon. My songs tend to
fit into those two groups,"

Arlo Will continue to push his
CD, sending it to schools and coffee»
houses around the Midwest. He in»

Scott's View

With the combined talents of
Hugh Grant, Tom Arnold, Julianne
Moore, ]onn Cusack, and Robin
Williams Nine Months should be
loaded with good humor and acting.
Unfortunately the combination of a
terribly predictable and stereotyped

script bringsdownasrarsrucldedeasr.

Moore and Grant are cast as the
leading couple. The plot ofthe mov—
ie is that Moore wants to have a baby
and Grant does not. They breakup
because Grant can‘t accept Moore’s
accidental pregnancy. Of course,
Grant has a change of heart and asks
Moore to marry him. She says yes
and paradise ensues.

If the acting and dialogue were
not so stultified and unendunible,
the plot could have been ignored
The stereotypes of the idiot immi-
grant, Williams, and the obnoxious
parents, Arnold and Cusack, are
prominent and painful in the meme.
Neitherstereotypeisentertainingbe-
cause the characters are not allowed
any originality.

Williams is neverablero display
his usual joy of acting because he is so
limited by his role as a weak Russian
immigrant. Incessant Jokes are made
about the inability of an immigrant

to remember the proper words for
things. Somehow Williams man-
aged to mistakenly use the word pus—
sy for almost everything imaginable.
EVidently this was supposed to be
funny; however. it was only gror
resque and unintelligent.

The wit Grant displayed in Four
Weddings isn’t allowed to surface in
the subrpar dialogue he is given .
Grant and Arnold verbally spar dur—
ing the moVie with Grant as a play
boy dilettante and Arnold as the
ultimateobnoxmusfather. Dialogue
becomes truly excruciating in scenes
where Arnold and Cusack fawn over
the prospect ofhavinganotherchild.
Grant makes a witty comment de-
grading child-bearing, and the dia»
logue quickly degenerates to a prim-
ltiVe and unimaginativegame ofpro»
fane name calling.

This movie is nothingmore than .
a loud. obnoxious bomb.
