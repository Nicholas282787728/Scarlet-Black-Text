The Pioneers are coming off of
a 2-2 week that included a win over
arch—rival Coe, an impressive 9.0
shutout of Cornell, and losses to
Heidelberg (OH) College and DeP—
auw (IN) College. The soccer wom—
en will return home to face Knox on
Saturday or 2:00pm.

Of the victory at Coe, Coach
Jenny Wood explained, “We needed
to make some changes in out de—
fense, so we were using different per—
sonnelatdefendetand midfield, We
had one practice with our new align—
ment before the game." The Pie»
neers trailed the improved Kohawks
at the half, LO, but a goal by senior
Kendra Fan in the 70th minute tied
the score.

“After we tied the score and got
into the flow of the game, we played
well. We simply had to adjust to our
new lineup," said Wood, A trenien.
doussave by goalkeeper Kathy Hans
en preserved the tie and sent the
pine into overtime, in which the
bootets outscored Coe, 3—0. Junior
Amy Robinson scored the go.ahead

goal, and For: later added her second
goalosinsurance, JuniorMollyMoil-
anen rounded out the scoring.

Last weekend the kickers trav—
eled to Greencastle, Indiana, to par—
ticipate in the DePauw Tournament.
The Pioneers lost to Heidelberg on
Saturday, 6—0. The kickers were hurt
by the loss of sophomore stopper Sal—
ly Goodspeed, who was injured Fri—
day. Woodexplained,“Heidelberg is
a very good team and is similar to
Macalestet in that they play a very
physical game. However, we were
not mentally prepared and when
Heidelberg scored on some great in—
diyidual efforts, we looked a little
shell—shocked."

Things didn‘t get any easier for
Grinnellon Sunday as they {need the
host team, DePauw, in the consola»
tion match, "We knew we would
have to be more mentally prepared
thanwe were Saturday,”commented
Wood. “DePaiiw is a very good team
that had been upset in the first round
of their own toumament and we knew
they would come out very angry,"
Wood added, “we needed to play
with more confidence in order to
play out possession game, and we did

a much better job Sunday." The
Pioneers fell to DePauw, 2—1. The
lone Pioneer goal was by Potz, who
scored in the first half to tie the
match at 1—1.

Although the team has changed
its defensive organization, Wood
praised the team’s efforts in adapting
to the changes: “The squad did avery
good Job of rallying around Good—
speed's replacement, rookie Erin
Doyle. Doyle had to mark Heidel«
berg’s rop striker, who is an creep.
rionalplayer, in hetfirststartandshe
did a tremendous job." Wood also
praisedtheworkofsophomoresweepr
er Maura Bartel. who moved to that
position after Sara Schoen moved
back to goalkeeper,

Despite the team‘s rough week
end, Wood remained optimistic, as
the Pioneers are still undefeated in
Midwest Conference play. "We
didn't do very well Saturday, but we
played the best that we could Sun—
day. We could really see the differ—
ence in mental preparation, We've
had a lot of players sick and injured
lately, but one player won’t win or
lose a game for us, The whole team
willdecidetheoutcome.”Woodcon—
cluded.
