Use of illegal drugs on the increase at Grinnell

Compiled arid written by the 55113 Start

ST Grinnellians, at some
pointoranother, have prob-
ably heard about or en~

counteredsomesort otitlegaidruguse
on campus.

Despite its location and seem-
ingly “sheltered environment,“ illegal
substances are readily available on
campus, and are being used on cams
pus, accordingto studentsinterviewed
on campus.

While no one can estimate the
numberofdrugusets on campus, most
students said that they either know
someone or have heard ofsomeone ztt
Grinnell who uses illegal drugs,

The students that were interr
viewed agreed that the most popular
drug on campus, excluding alcohol, is
deﬁnitely marijuana. Though precise
ﬁguresarenotavailable,studentsseem
to believe that the frequency otmari-
juana smoking and the demand for the
substancehas gone up in the past couple
of years.

One student who has distributed
marijuana at the college, said that in
one semester during the 199171992
school year he personally sold one
pound of marijuana to student buyers
on campus and thatatleastthreepounds

of a semester that year,

Another distributor operating on
campus this semester said so far this
semester he thought he had sold over
three pounds of marijuana

But not only do students believe
marijuana use to be on the rise, but
those interviewed also thought the
quality was better now than in the past

“This ain't California," one
upperclass Grinnelliztn said. “But the
sh-t that comes through is pretty cone

good, sticky, resinous buds,”

Prices are also more consistent

tended to average about $50 for a
quarter or an ounce of marijuana and
about $30 for an eighth of an ounce,
they said, while at today's a quarter is
running about $45 and an eighth is
$25.

The money students spend on
drugs comes mostly from summer sav-
ings,campusjobs,stlpendsfromMom

as one student thought, because it tends

buying up all the acid that’s available
whenever it hits campus.

One upperclassman said that acid
use has always been sporadic on cam-
pus wrth supply more than demand
being the deciding factor. The last
major exception to that nile, the stu~
dent said, was the spring semester of
1993, when acid was readily available
and sold for about four to ﬁve dollars

But while they couldn‘t estimate
the number of users or tile extent of
acid use at Grittnell this semester, stu
dents were able to say that since the

Another user described the acid

When it comes to hardcr drugs
than marijuana or acid, students said
that they do exist on the campus, but
that they are rarely seen, Cocaine has
surfaced in the past few years and
heroin has also been available, they
said, though the drugs don't seem very
popular with most Grinncll students.

Despite tltc apparent rise in the
popularity of drug use on campus,
students are quick to point out that
illegal drug use has always been a part
of Grinncll.

But how does tlle College feel
about drug use on campus? in the
section entitled “Use of Alcohol and
Illicit Drugs." the student handbook
reads, “Grinnell College prohibits the
unlawful posse ion, use, or distribus
lion ofalcohol or drugs by students
the college opposes misuse or illegal
use of illicit dnigs and alcohol in the
college community,"

Next week, the 5&8 will tzilk to
the college administration about drug
use on campus and to thc Grinncll
Police Department to see what — if
any — measures are being taken to
deal witti illegal drug use on campus
