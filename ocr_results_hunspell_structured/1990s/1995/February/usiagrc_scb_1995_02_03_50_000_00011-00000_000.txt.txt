HE Killer Lelnmings, also
I knownastthen'sLacrosse
Club, are hoping to win a
game this season.

"We are hoping to overcome our
suicidal tendencies this year," Scott
Marks, senior and one of the club’s
co-cnptains, said,

Lacrosse is a Spring sport that is
played with nine players and one
goalie on each side. The players use
a longehnndled stick with apouch on
the end to place a ball in the opposing
team's goal. According to Marks,
the sport has been described as the
"fastest game on foot."

The club was stancd approxie
nlatcly four years ago by Gl'lnnell
studentDavel-Iatzl'teld,buthasyetto
win a game.

“We’ve lost a lot of really close
games," Marks Satd. “If we play the
teams we want to, we'll Win one."

ers and has had a tough time against
groups With 4050 players, such as
the clubs at the Universtty of Iowa
and lowa State,

Presently the Grinnell club is
practicing indoors, ordering new
equipment and “basically teaching
the new guys how to play," Brad
Sikorski, sophomore and coecaptaln,
said,

The indoor season for the club
starts February 19with an away game
againstKnox. Marks saidthatdurlng
his sophomore year on the team, the
Knox club beat Grinnell by scoring
Within the last three seconds of the
game to make a comeback.

The team has a tradition of“blt—
ing the big one in the end," Marks
said,

The club hopes to end that tradie
tion, This year, the group is trying to
match the level of seriousness found
in other clubs.

“[Lacrosse] is being taken more
seriously this year. [t is being treated
as a sport," Sikorski said.

The Lacrosse season will include
several weekend tournaments after
Spring Break. Getting to these tour-
naments has not always been easy.
Marks said one year the team was so
desperate for transportation to
Carleton that they bribed someone
for the use ofa car. The club plans to
conclude the season with a big tour-
nament around Pig Roast tune, as it
has done in the past, but Marks said
he has to ﬁnd out when Pig Roast Will
be this year.

Anyone interested in playing
Lacrosse should vax [SIKORSKI] to
be put on the club’s mailing list.

“We’ll still be taking people for
awhile," Sikorski said.

For people just interested in
watching the games, Sikorski said he
will have a schedule available in two
weeks.

Jimmy Williams, senior

and presidentofthe Grinnell College
Men's volleyball club, said.

The club has been in existence

said.

fact that we couldn’t get a men's

' varsity team, The college would not
sponsor a varsity team, For good rear

The tournaments and games the
club plays are for men only because a
women‘s varsity team exists at
Grinnell.The club'sscnsoll lasts from
October to April. when the regional
tournament begins, and plactices are
held biweekly, The club is Sanctioned

the USVBA there are four divisions:
B, BB,Aand AA, withAA being the
highest. The Grinnell club is in the
BB division.
“It’s a good, competitive sys-
tem,” Williams said.
Opponents ofthe Grinnell club have
included Drake, the University of
Northern Iowa, the University of
Iowa, Central and Mahareshi Inter-
national University.
“Wedlsohelpouthih women's
games as well. We do the down»

and announcing," Williams said.
There have been no wills for the
club yet this season. Williams said
because there are not enough BB
teamswhoapplyforUSVBAtourna-
merits, those that do get moved up a
level.
“You'dbesurpriseclathowmuch
the level of competition goes up and
how good these teams are in the A
bracket,” Williams said. “But we‘ll
deﬁnitely win some before it‘s all
over.“

Regardless of the losses, Will-
iams said, “It's still a lot offurt to go
out there and just play and get all
ﬁred up and just get your testosterone
going."

This season the club has been
looking for players for every touma~
merit. Anyone interested in the team
is welcome to play. “(We have)just
been scraping to ﬁnd guys. We had

niors will be graduating in May and
will be leaving thcclub. Buthe hopes
the club will be placed in capable
hands next year,

someday it will become a varsity
team. That‘s been mainly our goal,"
Williams said.
