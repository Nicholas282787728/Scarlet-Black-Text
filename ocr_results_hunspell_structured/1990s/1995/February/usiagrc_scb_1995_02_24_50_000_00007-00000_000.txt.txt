ls multiculturalism a
problem at Grinnell?

By CHRIS I’ALLAS

Sports Editor
SDarrleobenspointed outinhiscominentarylastweele whileBlaekI-listory

AMenth is ac‘imc to celebrate black culture, itts alsoatirne to recognize glaring
contradictions and ask imponant questions. The question we should be

asking is: “Should Grillnell College be committed to multiculturalism at am"

In theory, multiculturalism is an admirable idea. The foundation ofthe concept
is that most mcism stems from the belief that the culture of the majority is better than
the minority According to multiculturalism, such beliefs are grounded in an
educational system that teaches individuals to Judge everything by Euroceiitn'e
standards As history is taught, everything was done first and done best by white
European males. Titus students assume anyone from a noanuropean culture is a
member ofa group who's members have ncvcraccomplishod anything. itnoonc o
that sort ever accomplished anything, it must be because all members of that group
an: inferior. Or so logic goes.

Multiculturalism seeks to remedy this situation by educating individuals about
the achievements and values ofotlier cultures. The idea is that ifpcoplc understand
me value of each cultule,thcn perhaps they willtespeet tlievalueand potential ofeach
member of that culture. Its a nice idea. but it has some ﬂaws.

First, “.5 imptactieal. Especially at the college level, you can’t force someone to
learn about otliercullures And Ihoseindlviduals whoateopen mlndoclenoughtotake
aeourse focusing just on black or Native American history probably aren t the ones

 

 

 

causing racial tensions inoursoeiety Fur-

thermore, it is impossible to educateevery

individual about every possible culture.

Few students have 16 credits free in their

schedule to take the intro 5 w, x, y and 2 EDITORIAL

cultures and tewerstill wouldbewillingto I Rather than develop-

spend ten thousand dollars (the approxir _ .

mate cost of one semester) to ﬂee their mg an Integrated commit-

minds. Even assuming that the students -

are willing to educate themselves about ”'0’ of culturally “WW9

othercultures, how does oriedeelde which bidiwduals Grinnell is

cultures" The college oenainly can’t af- . ’g ,

fordahouse,deparuncntorculturalccntcr degrading into a metal

for every minont at Gnnnell, What

would Mr. Robcnsysay about thecollege's battle 870W

comliutment to multiculturalism if the

school unveiled an Eskimo studies department and then announced that there were

no funds left to hire AﬁticanrAmetican studies professors?
0naseeondarylevcltheideabehind multiculturalism maybeﬂawed. Certainly

some racism iseauscd by ignol'tinceand abelietin cultural superiority, butagreatdeal

can probably be traced to the xenophobia that comes to most people almost

instinctively A lot ol'people tear other cultures simply because they are different.

These individuals aren’t going to attend multiculturalism classes and expmssingthe

uniqueness ofcacli race ihroughdcnionsuaiions and cultural events onlyemphasizes

the differences these people fear. This phenomenon IS otter. seen in the gay rights

movement. Most gays fit the cultuml pattern of mainstream society, but many people

for. them because they are perceived as being different. And when bearded men

match in nurse's unlfonnsdunng Gay Pride week in San Francisco, it doesn’tmake

these people feel any better about homosexuals.

Brit let us assume [or ii minute that multiculturalism can help end racism. Even
it [his were the case, there are huge problems in implementation, many ofwbich are
painfully Clear here at Gnnnell. First, the emphasis on the uniquenessofa culturecan
be taken so far that it leads to the alienation of other cultures. This is why
inultieultunilistn IS often blamed for causing voluntary segregation. Members oia
minority group will tell whites “You can't understand. because you aren't (black,
brown, red, etc)" or “You don’t know because you haven't been oppressed." The
desire to preserve cultuml identity leads to areverse meism as rnaJonty members are
excluded from houses, organizations and teaching positions.

There is alsoatcndciicy to emateanalterrcentnsm, where ratherthan attempting
to create ucompromise viewpoint, aminority group will demand that everything be
seen from its perspecuve, This defeats the purpose ofinulticulturalism; it replaces a
biased Eurocentn'e yardstick with an equally wt one.

Finally, as is often the case at Gt‘innell, the desire to create the illusion o
multiculturalism can supersede the commitment to a real multicultural envrronment.
The College creates :1 haphamrd patchwork ofhouses, cultural centers and depart
ments without regard to whether these things are actually utilized to educate students
and stop meism. The College also pursues an ambitious atrinnauvc action employ
nicnt program aiall levels ofliiiiiig with little regard to the quality ortlic candidate or
actual cultural contributions he or she might make,

In conclusion,Gi‘innell'spursuitofinulticulmmlism is highlyquesuonable. The
ideas behind multiculttlmlisnidohavelncrit.andcultumlevents opentoallindividuals
can help end cultural bias. However, a large scale multicultural program can not be
etiective. first becau, it IS impmeueal and second because ignorance is not the sole
source of racism. Furthermore. the college's eFtons to implement a large scale
multicultural program only demonstrates the problems inherent in such a program,
Rather than developing an integrated community of culturally aware individuals,
Grinnell is degrading into a metal battle ground. Minorities are arguing over who
deserves houses and departments while the administration points pridefully at the
numberofcolor‘ed sanitation workers andcallsthe sehoolmultjculmml. ThestudettB
haven‘t become any more open minded, only more bush-aim,
