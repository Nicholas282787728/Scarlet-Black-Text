I was disappointed. ldo think that it
could possibly scare away some
people from taking classes [because]
they think they might hurt their GPA.

I think it will increase chances that
graduate schools will accept classes
that are taken S/D/F ratherlhan pass/
fail.

It takes away the purpose ol'thc pass/

option as much because there will be
more risk involved in taking classes
in unfamrlarsubjects.
