The Cutting Edge

ANDY HICKEN
GUEST MUSIC Creme

It sometimes seems as if nearly
everyone at Grinnell can play guitar
at some level, A friend ofmine once
said that there are three levels of
guitar mastery at Grinnell: there are
people who play guitar, guitar play»
ers, and guitarists. Those in the last
category are few and far between.
Aron Racho ‘98 is one of those rare
cases.

Racho has been playing pop gui—
tar since 9th grade, and has studied
classicalguitarsince 10th grade. His
classical experience, especially with
music from the Romantic period, has
inﬂuenced his pop sensibilities. Ra»
clio says his pop music reﬂects “the
Romantic character or lyrical lines.

guitar arrangements a little more
complex, instead ofjust playingsim<
ple chords." But in addition to Ro<
mantic composers like Chopin, Rae
cho lists influences like UZ, Sting,
and Peter Gabriel.

Since he came to Gtinnell last
year, Racho has played solo at Bob‘s
and with handmates Juan Corlos
Ramos ‘98 and Taimur Rahman ‘98
at international student Organiza—
tion events (their band is epony—
mous, but has at times been referred
to as Common Ground). But Racho
says “I‘d consrder mysclrn composer
more than a periorrncr," and he's
recording a tape us “a personal
pro,ect" on a rountrnelt in his room,

consist of Racho’s own songs.

\X/ith politically-minded inﬂu—
ences like U2 and Peter Gabriel, one
might expect that Racho’s lyrics
would be about more than just scx,
cats, and drugs. Racho confirms that
“yeah, acouple are beyondyoutstan»
dard pop themes." For example, he
recently wrote asong called “Dedica—
tion” for Anne Frank. Racho is not
one orthose muslclzms who disregard
lyrics to concentrate totallyon musi—
cal complexity He says that to him,
”music and lyrics are the same thing.
They stein from the same source and
go towards the same ends."

In December, Racho plans both
one of his pop shows tit, probably,
Bob’s, and a student recital for his
Music 220 classical guitar lessons.
He’s also considering starting a band
inhis home country, the Philippines.

answer [0 that question, he says
“That's precisely why I’m taking a
double major (in music and chemis-
try). I’m notcertain." But even ifhe
goes into chemistry, Racho says he at
least has music “to keep myseli’ hu»
