Stonewall students carry message of
tolerance to local high school students

By ERIN HUSTINGS
Staff Writer

EW high schools are openr
F minded enough to address

controversial issues such as
homosexuality. Most avoid tltis is-
sue despite the needs of GLB teens
who often loiig for information and
support. Several members ofSione»
wall Coalition are getting the chance
to do what they wish had been done
for them by giving presentations to
Iowa high school students.

Stonewall's Education Come

mittee has visited two high
schools this year. and has aria
other vtsit scheduled for next
week. The group gives presenter
tions that include handing out a
facts and figures sheet and a list
of resources for teenagers, com-
ing out stories and descriptions
ofmembcrs‘ high school experi-
ences, and answering students'
questions.

Grinnell students have been
giving presentations on being
gay, lesbian, and bisexual for
several years ttow, but the Edur
cation Committee wasn’t for-
mally organized till lastyear. The
establishment of the committee
was due largely to the work or
Gwen Gifford, class of 1994,

Gifford and other Stonewall
members contacted Grinnellstur
dents who attended Iowa high
schools Theyaskedthemtosend
letters to the administrations of
their former schools recommendr
ing the Education Committee’s
presentation as legitimate and
beneficial, It is as a result of
these letters of recommendation
and presentations the group has
done for high scliooi counselors
that they have received requests
from high schools to come and
speak.

reaction they have gotten froth
students has been positive. “It‘s
interesting to see how uninformed
some students are, as well as how
informed otherstudents are,"said
sophomore Sarah Hallas. “What
ever their background and knowl-
edge, however, the students are
very inquisitive and receptive."

Grinnell students do the pre—
sentations both for themselves
and to reach out to others. “I
want to reach students who will
come out in the future, and to
makethem feel lesslonely and so
that they know that there is sup-
port out there," said sophomore
Celia Davis,

”Ithinkit'simportanttoedu»
cate students who have never met
a GLB person and to broaden their
horizons," said Hallas. “Some-
times I know thatsomething I‘ve
said has allowed someone to see
things in a different light, and
has helped turn homophobia into
compassion and understanding.
That’s such a great feeling."

Those on the committee feel
that high schools usually aren’t
very open or accepting atmo-
spheres for gay. lesbian or bi-
sexual students. They want to
promote the honesty about idcnr
tity that exists here at Grinnell,
and to insure through their prer
sentations that people leave the
room with more understanding
about homosexuality than they
had before, they said.

PRILl9,1995. Acarbomb
detonates next to a federal
building in downtown

Oklahoma City killing many of
people and injuring scores more,
TheAssoeiatcd Presspicture(whieh
appeared on the front page of many
newspapers across the us, and
around the world) ofarescue worker
canying a titangled infant from the
wreckage serves as a reminder that,
yes, acts of terrorism can and will
take place in America

In many ways, the incident
hit home for me. I once worked
on the 381h floor of a 39 story
federal building in Chicago. Ifa
car bomb went off when I was
working, I do not believetwould
be here today writing this col-
umn. Luckily, there were no
bombs when I worked.

My personal experience led me
to read as many accounts of the
bombing as I could, Many children
in the day care center in the base
ment of the building were killed,
Workers in federal buildings all
across the US. were frightened be
cause their building might be the
next target. Some people even sug-
gested that in the future, day care
facilities should not be put in federal
buildings so that young children are
not at risk from acts of terrorism.

Itisn'tvcry difficultto perform
an act ofterrorism, especially tfyou
don’t care ifyou get caught or die in
the process. All you need to make a
carbomb is a car, some gasoline and

 

Current

some fertilizer. Law enforcement
ofﬁcials admit that even though pl’Er
cautions are taken, acts ofterrorism
are hard to prevent.

The events in Oklahoma and
the fact that terrorism in Americais
ti reality leads us to some tough
questions. For example. what can
we do to make sure we are not
victims ofterroristaets? Do we pull
ourselves and our children out of
federal buildings? The effects of
the blastin Oklahoma City spanned
several blocks, so maybe all metror
politan areas should be out of the
question. Are we safe in Grinnell']
Think aboutit, Ifsomeone placeda
bomb in ARH while students were
attending classes, what safeguards
do we have to prevent a catastrophe
here?

It’s a scary World out there. It's
not safe to walk alone because of
rapists and muggers. Driving isn't
safe because ofcarjackings. It used
to be that the only threat people
faced at work were armed robbers
and the occasional disgruntled ex»
employee. Now, acts of terrorism
are a problem in America. We can
take precautions against becoming
the victim of these crimes, but we
never will be truly safe. In order to
deal with this new crisis in America,
wewilljusthavetclearntodealwith
it and pray that acts of terror-ism do
not harm people we care aboutor us.
Until we learn to deal with the social
problems facing the country that
causes some groups to resort to terr
rorist acts. terrorism will be a fact of
life in this country.
