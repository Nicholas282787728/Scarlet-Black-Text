Dining halls should provide

better nuuitional' ormation

By ELIZABETH MACKEY
Staff Writer

Tthejoint board meeting held on Wednesday. April 19, as you might

A already know havtng eagerly read the notes posted on bathroom

doors across campus, the Student Health Committee brought up the

issue of the quantity of nutritional information wluch is currently provided

about the food Gn‘nnell students eat at Quad and Cowlesi They suggested
providing more information.

For example take the cards that describe tonight’s dinner: Pizza Premio
consists of a ﬁve ounce 332 calorie portion of Pizza Premio, the Vegetables
withSeashellPastais threeouncesorvegetables with seashell pasta, the whole
kernal corn has 66 calories in each three ounce portion of frozen outcom. and
the Yellow Cake with Chocolate Icing has 209 calories in each 1.73 ounce
portion onellow Cake Mix with MilkChocolate icing. The breadsu'cks come
in one ounce portions, but, apparently. have no ingredients.

Providing more detailed information is a wonderful idea. Not only would
the healthconsciousstudentsbe grateful forthis informationabutalso students
with allergies to certain foods would benefit greatly. What does the student
allergic to garlic do when Assorted Pizza Premio is served? How does he or
she know if the tomato paste on the
pizzas conlains garlic? Cenainly the
cards do not help. Even something as

simple and apparently obvious as nuts EDITORIAL

content would help the health cone ——
scious with their future medical concerns. Many students who have soaked in
the general ideas promoted by the busy medical media are convinced that it
is a good idea to be concerned with fat and Calories and ﬁber and vitamin
intake. The government agrees, which is why you now see the standard
nutritional analysis on all the processed food you buy. This includesadetailed
listing of ingredients, vitamins and Calories as well as a breakdown of what
kind otcatories they are (he. far, carbohydrate or protein) and whatpercentage
these components make up of your recommended daily intake. In a world
obsessed with fat content, it seems absurd that Grinnell should lag so far
behind,

The signs that used to hang on the wood panels hiding the dirty trays at
Quad, the ones in semirpaslel colors‘that showed pictures ofa boy doing push
tips and had charts orthe evenpopular food pyramid, seem ironic decorations
when the very food they hide is a mystery to the students. Yes, the signs
indicate, it is a good idea to be concerned about nutrition. However, the
white“ingrcdients" cards do not supply the necessary information students
need in order to follow these guidelines. How can students attempt to comply
with the guidelines given by the American Hean Association about for and
cholesterol and fiber and protein when the students have no idea about the
content of their food?

Granted, there are difficulties in obtaining this information. The govem-
ment regulations that took effect during the summer of 1994 requiring food
manufacturers to provide the nutritional analysis of the food they sell do not
eovcrfoods sold in bulk. In orderto getthis information. DiningServices must
contact all of the food companies.

what to eat Obviously a steady diet of french fries is high in fat and is not healthy.
However, many shidents, for both immediate medical and long term interest are
convmwd that more speciﬁc information would be helpful to their diets and their
future ltealtii. If Ihe goventmcntrecognizes the importance of this information to the
consumer and has gone dirough the double of passing a law requiring that the
infommLion be made available, than Gi‘lnnell should follow suitand go through the
