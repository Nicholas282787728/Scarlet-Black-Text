Can’t Talk, Eating;

By JED ORTH, JASON WOLF, MATT HABER & JON

few weeks ago. we were treated :
to another entry in our Taste of
Grinnell contest. Emily Parker

cooked for us and her housemate, Janet
Matthews, helped us cat (although we
hardly needed the exb'rtstomaclt). Emily
served us turkey IEU'JZml. homerbakcd
brezitl and a tossed salad.

When we got to Emily's house. we
were rudely greeted at the door by her
otherhousemaleMaurocn Ness,who was
still trying to convince Emily that the
entire contest was nothing more dian a
scam for free meals. As soon as she saw
thrilled was wearing his bat suit she shied

for you, we havehundreds ofback copies
available for a small food donation. [We
will trade them for food (eggplant. ﬁsh.
spicy food and milk unacceptable <and
remember, no meat for Jed>)]). (Hey,
when was the last time you saw parenthe-
ses. brackets braces & the yeater than]
lessthan sign inthesame sentence? And
we got an ampersand and a backslash in
there too! Damn we’re 100% smooth.
Yes. We’reﬂ! Too bad we're not using
our * rating.)

0k, now where were we before we
went punctuation crazy? Oh, yeah,
Maureen was in the comer and we were
sitting down to a feast When Emily
placedtheturkey rerrazini on thelable. we
were all confused because there wasn't a
thiclc cnisty layer of cheese on top. She
said that unlike dining services, she is not

supplied with a neverending stock of
govenirnent chase. Thank God some-

one in this town knows how to make a
good teuazirii.

Enily underesn'maled our stomach
capacides because she initially served us
about halfa cup each. After we sucked
thatdown beforeshehad LheCthnce to put
the pot hack on the stove. we sat waiting
for the magic words: “abracadabm!”
Althougt she never said mat. when she
uttered‘help yourselves to seconds." that
was good enougi

his dentures at home and had to gum it all
down. “Now that’s good satin" Malt

the particular obligation ofan educational

work together.” The plan commits us to
“extra efforts to retain competent women

During my three years at Grinnell.
every administrative and support staff
position advertised carried with it legiti-
mathualiﬁcations neodedto perlonri the
functions ottltetob. in every instance. the
person hired metthe published qualiﬁca-
tions and most exceeded them.

Hiring audlorlty for adiilinistmtive
and support staff positions is approprir
ately decentralized on our campus. lndi»
vtdual department heads or vice-presi-
dents) identify the candidate they wish to
hire after what is generally a very exten
sive process including: interviews (teler
phone and personal). reference checks,
skills testing and degree veriﬁcation. My
office prepares an offer letter. which is

is extended on behalf of our various den
panment hearts and vicerpresidems.
The college’scommitmentto build-
ingainodelcornmunity whichretlects the
woi'ldin which we live today makes good
business and educational sense. We have
hired and retained excellent. well quali-
fied. dedicated employees wrthcut regard
for their race. color. religion. gender, nan
uonal origin. age. disability or sexual orir
eniat‘ion. As we debate the merits of
affirmative action. diversity and
inuluculturalism, I sincerely hope we do
so wilh these facts about our colleagues

I think we have the ideal amount of
time off. I don’t really mind that we
start early. either. because it‘s nice to
have a fall break.

Yes. because ending earlier for sum»

is way too long.
