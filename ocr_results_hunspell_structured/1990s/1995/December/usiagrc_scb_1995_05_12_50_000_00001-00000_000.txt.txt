discovered Friday as a result of an article
published in theNew York Times on May
5. Warren Buffet. one of the richestmen
in America and longtime member of the
collegeBoardofTrtistees,currently holds
24 million shares of Gillette stock.

BufTetl. whose wonh is estimated at
over$l 1 billion, began acquiringthestock
in I989. according to the article. His
Gillette stock is worth two billion dollars.

No inforlnzitjon was available at
pi esselec on whether the college's enr
dowmenl hasalsobeen inveslodinGillette.
However, since some of the trustees offer
ﬁnancial advice and oversee the invest~
lncntofcollege funds, college investment
in Gillette stock is probable.

Even iftheeollegeimelfhas no stock
iri Gillette or Proctor & Gamble. SDAE
feels that Buffeu‘s Gillette holdings are
detrimental to its campaign. Bocausethe
school year is nearly over, it is unlikely
that the group will address the problem
immediately, Junior Aaron Gross, meme
bet ofSDAE, said. Instead, it will be the
first dung SDAE does next fall.

“We will approach [Buffett] and see
if he’s sympathetic to ourconoems,"said
Gross, “We’ll ask him to exert the inﬂue
