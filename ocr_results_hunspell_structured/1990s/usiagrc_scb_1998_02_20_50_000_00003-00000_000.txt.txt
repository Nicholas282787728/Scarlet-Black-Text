As mid-terms roll around,

Grinnell's harried, tormented stu-
dents are attending more art exhibits
and entertainment activities to re-
lieve their stress. However, arts and
entertainment on campus comes in
many forms. Which events to sit in
on and which to skip? Seven random
students were polled for the answer.

Some students choose to visit the
Forum's art exhibits. Last week Dan
Donaldson ‘00 viewed the pieces dis-
played in the Forum by the Art
SEPC. Donaldson said,“ I thought it
wasjuvcnile. I have to admit that I
really didn’t understand what they
were trying to say. Since the pieces
were falling offthe
Wall the next day, I
had a hard time re-
specling it. I like
seeing the students
produce art, butI
just didn’t like this
particularexhibit."
On the other hand,
some students en-
joy the art in the
Forum. Laura
Schwartz ‘98

series of KDIC interviews.

This week, ‘Annika Engineer pays a visit to Paul
Pasquesi’s show, “Post Modern Apocalypse -

semester’s Mingus Big Blind seemed
to be a favorite among Grinnellians.
Rob Felty ‘OI stated, “The Mingus
Big Band was such a good concert.”
Orwig had a different palm of view,
“I would say that the Mingus Big
Band was really cool, but that was a
long time ago. Il seems to me that
before we came here, we heard that
a bunch of big names came. like the
Reel Big Fish. I was really excited
to gel to go to free concerts. thn
we got here it didn't seem like there
were a lot that I wanted to attend,"

Many students assert that Bob’s
Underground is the place to be if you
want to be entertained. ”I see Bob's
as it source of entertainment more
than any other
thing this year,"
siatchyles.
Bcntich agreed.
"There is a lot of
cool stuffgoing on
in Bob‘s recently,
for example, the
Ed Moore story
reading and the
Abbey Rolling
Trio," he said.
Orwig concurred
by stating, “Bob’s
has a lot of little

have The Ritalin

Soul Food:

@ﬂﬂﬂm

Written and Directed by George
Tillman .lr. Starring Vanessa Will-
iams, Vivicia Fox, Nia Long, Mekhl
Phifer.

Wow. Soul Food is an amazing
portrait of an extended African—
American family in Chicago, The
family is full of complex, conﬂict-
ing personalities, but as the ﬁlm
opens they are handled with toying
tenderness and wisdom by Momma
Jo, the family‘s matriarch But she
becomes sick, and things begin to fall
apan. People start missing Sunday
dinner, a 40»ycar tradition, and start
paying people to beat each other up,

But therc is a unifying force. The
narrator of the story is a 10-year old
boy who possesses some of the spirit
of Mamma Jo. After she gets sick,
he takes it upon himseifto try to unite
everybody.

This is the most touching and lions

Ifyou haven‘t seen this movie yet,
you are probably wonderin g what the
fuss is all about. Besides being
named the greatest movie in Amcrir

critics, II has been parodicd about 20
times by one of the famous staples
ofAnicl'iczin culture: The striipsons.
It lives up to and cxcccds its own
buzz,

Citizen Kama, based loosely on thc
life of Yellow Journalist William
Randolph Hearst, is the lnost intense
and thorough character study I have
ever seen. The movie rcally screws

Overall, Grinnellians are satisfied
with the arts and entertainment pro-
vided by the college. “Considering
how big we are, Grinnell does a re-

Schwartz continued.

If you are one of the 14 people
worldwide who don’t know what
“Rosebud" refers to in this movie,
don‘t find out between now and the

secret in movie history. The story
absolutely hinges on it. A rare per-

The Chemical Playgroun

As I walked through the door, I
was greeted by “Pigfacc,” a band
that plays experimental music indica-
tive of the type of music that Paul
Pasqucst ‘01 plays on his radio show
“Post Modern Apocalypse - The
Chemical Playground? To me, the
sounds emanating from Paul‘s stereo
system,neat1y setup under a plethora
of Marilyn Manson propaganda,
sounded like a bunch ofdying people
moaning and wailing, But Paul as—
surcd me that this was indeed mu-
sic, and not the soundtrack for a men-

a war movie, PHOTO CRED

AE: So, is
there a story
behind the
s o m e w ii a t
unique title of
your show 7

PP: Well, I
like getting
dressed up in
post modern
apocalyptic
dance gear
and going to raves with my friends.
It’s kind of a slylc in Europe right
now and has been for the past couple
of years. It was always fun to get
dressed up in military-type gear and
wear gas masks and Terminator 2-
looking stuff and then wrap
glowsticks into fishnet shirts and
parade around in ‘cm. Basically, I
just liked doing all that, Hence the
title.

AE:If one were to tune into your
show, what type of music would one
expect to hear? Would it be rave
music or something similar to that?

PP: No, this tends to be a little
darker than rave music .more Gothic
sounding really. Hard Core industrial
kind ofstuff.Acouple of weeks ago.
I played some really ambient, really
experimental stuff as well as lots of
illbient and trance, like that Pigfacc

_ stuff I was just playing...

AE: Oh, you mean the dying
people 7

PP: Exactly...stuff like Dead
Voices on Air and a lot of improvi-
saiional music like this German band
called Foo Iob...they'rc really cool
and it was funny because when I

of people calling in to say that the
siuffI was playing was tripping them
out.

AE: So,what exactly is the theme
ofyoi show 'I

PP:Well, my show‘s theme is ex—
perimental but for every show-I tend
to do new themes within the sphere
of tlie'main one.

AE: OK, pretend I’m about ﬁve
years old and explain that one Io me

PP: Well, I’ll pick a style like

or experi-

stick to that

throughout
the show.

AE: OK,I
get it. So,
how main-
stream is this
type of mu,
sic and what'
kind of fol—
lowing do
you think it
has, espe-
cially on the
G r i n n e l l
campus?

PP:WelI,
to tell you
the truth, I
have no idea. I play some guitar in»
dustrial stuff, which is like hard-Core
dance music. That's pretty popular
in a lot of Chicago clubs, bands like
Killing Jake and Ministry. Also, stuff
like Delirium is starting to get pretty
mainstream and it‘s funny because
it has taken them 12 years to get
popular as the style of music that
they’ve been doing only started to
become common a couple of years
ago. They were the first electronic
band to use Gregorian chants'and
tribal kind of effects like African
pygmy chants, synthesizers, Spanish
ﬂamenco guitars, female vocals and
drum beats. They were doing that
back in ‘87 and people didn’t start
paying attention to them until bands
like Enigma and Deep Forest started
becoming popular, In fact, their new
album Karma just went platinum.

AE: Good for them. So when ex<
actly is your radio show 7

PP: Sunday nights from ten to
midnight, which is better than my last
semester's timing, midnight until two
am. on Thursdays... and then I had
an 8 o’clock class on Friday, so that
was JuSl killing me.

AE: What do you thinkis the most
interesting/unique aspect of the your
show?

PP: Well. I think there are some
shows that will play more of urban
dance stuff, shows like “Mechanical
Reconstruction," where the D} will
play a lot of more modern sounds like
Frontlinc. My show is more ofamix
of sounds and tends to focus more
on the experimental side of stuff. A
lot of the shows tend to play dance
or club music. I'm not too sure, but
I don’t think there are any other
shows on campus that do tribal or
guitarlike music. i also play some
Green River songs that are really
pretty with lzrstring acoustic guitars.
0r sometimes th'm in ashitty mood
I'll play stuff that means a lotto me,
like Kern, which is a funk metalstype
band that‘s really frantic and has ex-
cellent grind rhythms. Just really in.
tense and emotionally taut
music...but I'll also do stuff that's a
little more ambient. I use sounds that
are kind of contradictory, and mostly
it tends to be electronic music. Ogre
from Skinny Puppy just kind of
strings together words even if they
don’t make any sense. And the lead
singer from Korn can sing, scream,
yell, rap, scat. you name it. Some.
times, though, I‘m in the mood for
pretty female vocals like Dead Can
Dance or Tori Amos.

AE: If you were to sum up your
show in one sentence or less, how
would you describe it 7

PP: I would probably have to de-
scribe it as tin experimental mind I‘Mk !
