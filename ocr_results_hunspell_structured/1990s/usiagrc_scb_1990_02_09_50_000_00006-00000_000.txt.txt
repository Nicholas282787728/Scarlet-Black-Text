South Africans Ponder
Changes At Home

By Vanessa Prendas-Lopez

At the South African
Conference, held in Ohio this past
summer, Nonhlanhla Makwakwa
uttered the dramatic cry. “Do not
be afraid of threats, intimidations,
torture. and other related evils.
The oppressor is losing power!"

A student at Grinncll,
Makwakwa gave this prescient
assertion just before the election
of president FiWi dc Kierki De
Klerk, an emerging political ﬁgure
praised recently for his signiﬁcant
reforms, became president of
South Africa in, September. The
legalization of the African
National Congress, the Pan
African Congress, and the South
African Communist Party. the
increasing tolerance towards
peaceful demonstrations, and the
release of political prisoners,
constitute some of the changes do
Kierk has developed.

Makwakwa and other Grirtnell
students, Phumelele Mbalo and
Linda Stofile, expressed wary
optimism towards reforms that
seemed almost unattainable a few
months ago. Makwakwa,
showing an uncontrollable
excitement, declared that black
South Africans must be happy,

but cautious. Since the state of
emergency has not been lifted, she
is afraid that the army will
exercise supremacy over the
President‘s decisions.

Perhaps those who considered
sanctions against the South
African Government a failure can
now see that international pressure
does have an effect on the country.
According to Makwakwa,
sanctions, though they might
affect blacks adversely at ﬁrst, are
necessary to force the government
into instituting reforms. South

African blacks, she continued.
have suffered all of their lives: she
sees suffering a bit more for a just
cause as wonh it

Raised in a society ruled by
racial distinctions, the South
African students have experienced
some culture shock since they
arrived in the United States. They
have adapted well. however, to the
North American way of living
They hope that very soon South
African black citizens can enjoy
the same freedoms as citizens of
the U.S.

Class Prepares Students for Emergency

By Ann Tretstrnan

What sort of class offers r es
in speeding ambulances, exciting
evenings in busy hospital
emergency rooms, and the ever-
present possibility of dealing with
childbirthing? Emergency medical
technicians (EMTs) train
experience all of the above and
more.

Pete Kcssler, who organized
such a class in Grinnell through
Iowa Valley Continuing
Education, described the course
lhaLinvolvcs much more than
basic first aid.

An EMT is someone certiﬁed
by the state who goes to the scene
ofnn accidentand can evaluate the
degree of injury sustained, and
quite possibly can begin
treatment. He or she is not a
medical doctor, but is trained in
certain areas of immediate and
sometimes life-saving techniques.

“You're an entry-level type
person, making a real dent.” said
Kessler, a licensed EMT himself.
He explained that most accident
victims are helped by a chain of
people before actually getting to
the hospital. He pointed out that
the first encounter is usually with
someone who might know first
aid or Cardio-Pulmanary
Resuscitation (CPR). Next, a

”first responder", such as a
policeman or firefighter would
assist or begin CPR. By this
time an EMT should have arrived.
often with an ambulance. He or
she could stabilize the patient and
ascss damages. calling the hospital
to notify them of what to expect.

Kessler vehemently stressed
that the EMT services are, “never
a substitute for hospital or
physician care." Sometimes,
though, the immediate aid given
by an EMT can mean the
difference between life and death
for a patient.

This concept of immediate care
is central to the whole success of
emergency medical services
(EMS), says Kesslcr. The
Department of Transportation
(DOT) developed the program in
the late sixties in response to the
numbcr of highway accidents.

There are different levels of
expertise Within the EMS system
Kesslcr explained that a beginner,
or basic, EMT requires 81 to 120
hours of training, while a
paramedic needs from one to two
years of intense training, working
in hospitals and medical doctors.

paramedic from Newton. Iowa, the

instruction in basic EMS care.
Hillcrs is the head of County

Paramedic Assist in Des Moines.
Job opportunities for EMTs
are varied. Private hospitals often
staff paramedics, as do national
parks and forests. Many
firefighters and members of police
squads arc EMTs. Kessler hopes
to become a paramedic, get an
advanced degree in an EMS related
field, and then teach or get into the
administration related facets of the

Keeping the PACE in Jail

By Simon Levin

Going to work involved
showing my ID three times,
getting frisked thoroughly,
having my book bag eraycd,
being stamped with an
ultraviolet stamper on my hand,
and waiting for someone to
come and get me. Then we
would move from guard to
guard, gradually being passed
down to a special section of
division four. We were then
looked in with roughly 60
inmates in the largestjail in the
United States. and afternoon
classes began. Programmed
Activities for Correctional
Education (PACE) is a program
in Chicago to help inmates get
their general education degrees

It is hard to explain how
different everything is in jail.
The guys I worked with are
awaiting trials for crimes that
range from armed robbery to
drug dealing or trafﬁcking.

I made a friend while in jail.
His name is Danny. Danny is
23 years old and a very bright
man. He has a son, and belongs
to the Conservative Vice Lord
Nation. Danny sent me a letter
the other day. He started off
with “Things are O.K.” and
followed with “The judge gave
me three years for all my
charges, I think I will have to

only do five months, I should
be out by Summer."

Some days school would be
canceled because of gang
activity; everybody in jail and
prison is gang affiliated. In
Chicago, gangs are divided into
two rival nations called the
“Folks" and the “People." These
nations exist both in and out of
prison, and sometimes one gang
would strike out against a gang
belonging to a rival nation. On
one occasion school was late in
starting because all the students
had to be strip-searched before
and after classes. The reason for
the stripesearch was that handles
were missing off of some of the
cell doorsi These handles are
used like brass knuckles.

Everybody is black or
Hispanic in the jail. Their ages
range from 18 to 30. Tattoos
showing gang afﬁliation adorn
all arms: Vice Lords. Latin
Kings, Disciples, insane
unknowns.

These guys are some of the
best students anyone could ever
ask for. They are bright and
interested, and they are in class
because they volunteered to be
there. One fellow was 28 years
old and I was teaching him
thirdAgrade reading about
Christopher Columbus. What
