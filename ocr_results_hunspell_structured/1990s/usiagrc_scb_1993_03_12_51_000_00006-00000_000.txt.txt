To the Editor:

I am disturbed by the decision to
mandate “permanent" language
houses next year. First, students, the
people who are going to be living
there,do notseem to support the idea.
Students pay over$4000 to live in the
houses: they should decide what
groups live in them. It should not be
a concern of the faculty.

Most students need special per—
mission to live off college property.
The ten houses are the only realistic
option for most students to get off
campus and live with their friends in
an environment they feel comfort-
able with.

Iarnalso disturbed by the impres—
sion this creates—thatwhen students
show supportfor something, more the-
atre faculty for instance, they are told
to have faith in the process. when
faculty wantsomething, they can soon
vert the process and get the adminis
nation to make “arbitrary” decisions.

I have advice for people think-
ing about living in language houses:
If you are not 100% sure that that is
the environment you want to live in,
don’t sign up. There will be students
eager to use the house if the language
departments can‘tfill them. Give them
the opportunity to live there.

To the Editor:

As an alum of Grinnell, I was
pleased to notice in the 5&3 that
Tripod Bob‘s legend lives on. How—
ever, I would like to report a Bob
sighting in December. Tripod Bob is
alive and well, last seen roaming
around on south Broad Street, down
intheneighborhoodofLakeNyanza.
This is the absolute iruiliiunless
Grinnell has been graced with two
gray, three-legged cats.

To the Editor:

I went to the Consolidated con-
cert on Saturday night with an open
mind. Although industrial/rap is not
my preferred taste in music, I had
heard enough positive things about

the group that I wanted to see What it
was all about. I sat in the bleachers.
eager to see what was in store.

I am very tolerant towards varin
ouskinds ofinusic, my tastes include
Jefferson Airplane, En Vogue, Alice
in Chains, and Arrested Develapn
merit, but I have to admit that within
five minutes of the show I was liter-
allyready to vomit. It wasn‘tso much
the quality of music that disgusted
me, but the angry, militant approach
to “liberal" politics.

I watched the images of Nazis
marching and then looked into the
audiencepulsatingtothebeat,poundn
ing their lists angrily at the evils of
society that appeared on the screens.
All I could ask myself was, “Is this
not the same mindless propaganda
used in Nazi Germany?” Was the
beginning of NaziGen-nany any more
thanaporson on center stage remind-
ing the frustrated crowd of thepeoplc
who hurt us, while encouraging his
audience to feel solidarity through
our anger? The only difference from
Nazi German propaganda was that
these people were “on my side.”

I thought that the liberal move
ment was created to inspire tolcrd
ance.Whatlsawwas thccxacloppo-
site of tolerance.

People screaming simulta-
neously “Hate crimes against gays
and lesbians must stop!" at the top of
their lungs doesn‘t teach tolerance:
rather it perpetuates anger and hate
againstan”enemy."Yes,hatecnmes
against gays and lesbians must stop.
but don‘t we lookjustas ugly as our
enemy when we shout and scream at
selected images of them that appear
on a screen?

Problems in this world don’t get
solved by perpetuating anger, they
get solved by trying to undersmnd
each other's perspectives.

I’msosick ofthiscampus living
the lie that we‘re all so open-minded
to the ideas of the world. If people
were open-minded they’ll stop babn
bling their beliefs and talk to each
other, We're so caught up in being
right, that we’ve ceased to listen.

Don’t let yourself be as ugly as
the gay bashcrs, the members of up
elation rescue, or the NeonNazis. I
bet they look at Grinnell College stun
dents and think we‘rejust as ugly as

we perceive them to bcithat’s prob-
ably one ofihereasons that they keep
fighting like they do.

If we are going to call ourselves
progressive peace makersofthe world,
we can’t forget that we’re ALL hun
man, whatever our perspectives may
be. We are ALL oppressed in some
wayoranoiher, whetlierwearewomen,
men, black, white, fat, short, beautiful
or ugly. We are also ALL oppressors,
If we forget these things we will con
tinue to play the games of our enemy
and will end up perpetuating thecircles
that true peace makersof the world are
trying to break.

To the Editor:

I would like to suggest to Alan
Ostergren that he stop listening to
little birds and start looking for facts.
It is obvious that he did not consult
any ofthe people who are organizing
the PAFA-sponsorcd initiative that
he spoke out against in last week’s
5&3.I\vouldliketoclearupsomcof
the niisconccptions conceniing this
initiative.

First, it does not simply support
a woman’s right to choose. This cur-
rent initiative supports the Freedom
of Choice Act, a piece of legislation
currently before beth houses of Conn
gress which would make it impos
sible for a state to limit a woman’s
right to choose. The full text of the
bill is included in the initiative.

We feel strongly about this inin
tiauve not because of the statement it
will make on campus, but because it
can be used as an effective lobbying
tool. It may notseem that the major-
ity opinion of Grinnell College stu-
dents would be very important to a
legislator, but we vote, and therefore
we matter. State Representative Dene
his Black says he would not have
won the recent election without the
support of the district in which most
Grinnell students vote Because he
relics so heavily on our votes. his
actions must reflect what we as a
campus believe.

Second, the current initiative is
notthe “blanket statement” from four
yearsago. When we decided to spon-
sor a student initiative for this aca-
demic year several people voiced

some of the same concerns that
Ostcrgrcn expressed. PAFA recogn
nizes that not all Grinnell students
are prenchoice. In fact, we are cur-
rently working with Grinnellians for
Life in an attempt to put political
differences aside and work together
to support women.

Those of us who organized the
initiative do respect the rights of the
minority are uncomfortable with a
“blanket statement." Therefore. we
deemed to add to the in ative the
boldfaceportionofthefollowingstaie-
merit:“We,amajorityofthestudents
of Grinnell College, support the Free
dom ofChoice Act..." If the initiative
is supported by a majority of student
votes,according to SGA rules,thereis
no untruth in this statement.

When it is Lime to vote, I would
encourage everyone to seek out facts
instead oflistening to rumors. I urge
anyone who believes in a woman’s
right to choose to support the Free-
dom of Choice Act initiative,

To Ihe Editor,

Wc,ihe undcrsigncd,belicvcthal
the 5&3 has done a great disscrvice
to the Grinnell College community.
On Fcbniary 2628, twenty men rcp-
rescnted Grinnell College at the Con-
ference Swimming and Diving meet
and yet this event did not receive cov-
erage in the 5&8. As the culmination
of the entire swimming season, cer-
tainly an event of this importance
shouldbcincludtx‘lin the schoolp'apcr.

Maybe there was no article be
cause the Mad Dogs came in second.
If so, is the fact that sophomore diver
Nate Brennaman qualified for na-
tionals not news? There were other
Conference champs: J. P. Fiening
(400 IM) and Mark Anderson (100
Fly). The 200 Free Relay (Anderson,
Doug Murphy, Doug Foster, Luther
Davis) set a new Conference record,
and Matt Haber had an amaztng win
in the 200 Breast Consols. Are these
and theeffons ofiheother team mem»
bers not worth putting in print? Ap-
parently not.

When the sportseditor was qucsn
tioncd about the lack ofcoverage, he
claimed thattherejustwasn’tenough
room. While we would not dare to
suggest that coverage of one sport
should preempt any other, we never»
theless cannot understand why the
biggestincctoftlie yearby oneofthe
most successful teams at Grinnell is
notimponantcnough Ihatspace could
be found for an article.

But this brings up an important
point: itis unreasonableto expcctthe
sports to fit on justone page. If hun-
dreds ofsiudentsare willing to invest
several hoursevery day to train,comn
pete, and represent Grinnell in their
spom,aren’ttheireffortsandachieve-
merits worthy of newspaper cover-
age? We think so, and hope that the
5&8 will live up to its name as a

newspaperand reportonthose things
that are newsworthy.

To the Editor:

We the undersigned wish to in-
form the S&B as well as the campus
community thatwe agree with the first
letter. Last night, however, at a round
table discussionatiheBar,wedecided
we don’t really give a shit. We swim
for the team and personal achieve-
ment. Notoriety, althougli nice, is not
n driving force for our competition.
Besides, it’sjust the 5&8.

To the Editor:

I atn writing with regard to the
Free Cafe which has been open on
Wednesdays from 10:00 p.m.iomid-
nightforafewweeks now. Although
I respect the right of Becky Meyer
and Tom Zlabinger to open up a stu-
dentnrun cafe Similar to Bob‘s Un-
derground (among other reasons to
allowforsmokingandtoavoid“high”
prices), I question this being done on
such a small campus.

Bob’s Underground is one ofthe
first truly student-run establishments
that Grinnell has seen in its history.
The speed With which it was set up is
admirable.

For lhcptisl year, I have watched
Bob’s struggle through hard times
and adapt to student needs. In addi-
tion to housing the escort service,
Bob’s is constantly trying new prod»
ucts,bookingintriguingacts,display-
ing community artwork, soliciting
inpulandtakingnsks.Banningsmokn
ing was such a risk. As you know.
however, this decision was made af-
terpolling studenmailength. Itwas a
student decision.

I commend Bob’s Underground
andallofitsstaffforcreatingaunique
and much-needed student coffccn
house. Give the changes Bob‘s is
currently making a fair chance. If
either hang-out is really to be for the
students, we need to be supportiveof
each other. We simply do not have
enough people to pit groups against
each other.
