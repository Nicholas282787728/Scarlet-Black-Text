Dear Editor.

We are writing to voice our anger
and frustration with the Scarlet and
Black for its lack of concrete cover
age of our show HEAR NO EVIL
SEE NO EVIL SPEAK NO EVIL,
We feel that this silence is represen-
tative of the greater silence surrounde
ing the issue of sexual violence, at
Grinnell College and throughout our
society.

Sexual violence happens daily, to
people we all know, perpetrated by
people we all know. in remaining
quiet about the reality of our lives,
we allow the rest of the world to hold
on to the luxury ofa sense of safety.

We realize that our art makes people
uncomfortable. This feeling of un-
ease and discomfort is closely related
to the silence and shame that sur-
rounds sexual violence, However, as
anists, as people of integrity, and par-
t'cularly as survivors, we believe that
it is vital to give creative expression
to our experiences.

As stated in the Barbara Kruger
poster used to advertise our
show:“your comfort is my silence."

A lack of dialogue fails to change
the reality of sexual violence. Itdoes.
however, encourage perpetrators to
abuse, and it keeps victims and sur-
vivors trapped in a world where it is
unsafe to even speak.

Based on the responses in our com-
ment/dialogue book, we are more
aware than ever ofthe need for serir
ous, sensitive dialogue about these
issues at Grinnell. We would like to
let survivors, victims, and others af-
fected by our show to know that there
are safe places to go for support, or
if you just Want to talk. Vax Lisa

[MATYE] for information on a .

survivor‘s support group that will
soon be starting. Call the Domestic
Violence AltemativeslSexual Assault
Center at l 800 779 35 l 2 to talk cone
fidentially, at any time.

We encourage survivors and vicv
tims to begin to speak. We encour—
age thggest of our community to li
ten. irii'

Dear Editor,

On Saturday night at the auction
after the Casino Night. we (Joe and
Stephany Moon) had almost no
money to bid with ($200) versus all
the other people who had cash in the
thousands. So when it came time to
bid for the night at the Carriage
House, we ﬁgured we had no chance.
However, we bid anyway, ﬁguring
that since we were the only married
couple in the audience, we might get
lucky. The restrictions said “married
couple or student by themselves." We
bid our $200 and Joe stated that he
was the only man who could take his
wife out for this night. Well, from the
back of the room a voice piped out,
“$10,000," and Joe asked the guy
why, The guy replied, “Because I
want to take something home." Robe
ert Reasoner and Robin Wagner were
sitting near us and heard what the guy
said and Robert bid $20,000. The guy
didn't bid over that and so Robert
won. After going up and getting the
certificate, he gave it to us. And that
was an incredibly cool thing to do.

I’d like to thank Roben and Robin
and to let people know Just what a
great thing those two did.

Dear Editor.

In last weeks S&B Mr. Jeff Gepner
wrote a letter to the editor in regard
to RISE‘s efforts to protest the im-
pending war in Iraq. He said that our
views were “extremely misleading,“
”ﬁlled with mistakes." and created
“myths." Mr, Gepner then contin-
ued to replace our ignorant position
with a reiteration of the
establishment‘s views on the Iraq

OPINION

crisis. Therefore, in writing against
Mr. Gepner RISE is not attempting
to vilify the individual. On the con—
trary, RISE is attempting to explain
how “misleading" arc the views that
the establishment feeds us,
Cultural Destruction,
First, RISE never suggested that
he economic sanctions and the
military coalition in the Persian Gulf
[are] a conspiracy to destroy Iraqi
culture." This statement creates a
straw-man of our argument. RISE
has maintained consistently that the
economic sanctions and the military
coalition serve only to further the
interests of US imperialism, and
therefore, need to be opposed. The
fact that the fabric of Iraqi society is
being destroyed in consequence of
maintaining US interests is, in eyes
of the establishment, an unimportant
externality. The disregard for Iraqi
lives only underscores Washington's
reckless and wasteful drive for domir
nation in the region.

Mr. Gepner has confused the whole
issue with an answer to a different
question. In answer to the question,
“Why has the US. been so interested
in exporting fascism to the Iraq 7" Mr,
Saadi Simawe (an Iraqi) replied that
it was because Iraqi society was ex-
tremely political and revolutionary.
Washington's speciﬁc treatment of
Iraq—the help given to the Fascist
Bathist party since l9637is a prod-
uct of the revolutionary potential of
that country and its fundamental cone
tradiction with US imperialist inter—
ests.

Nuclear War.

Second, Mr. Gepner contends that
Washington is not contemplating a
nuclear strike. A front-page report
in the Feb. 1 New York Newsday
revealed that in November President
Bill Clinton signed a top-secret die
rectivc authorizing the use of lacti-
cal nuclear weapons against Iraq un—
der certain conditions. Such an ille-
gal ﬁrst strike with nuclear weapons
violates the Nuclear Nonprolifera-
tion Treaty, which both the United
States and Iraq have signed.

Members of the Nuclear Resister

‘ .reieaséd‘the following iiircr'ni'aiion‘

oil February 5th. Retired Air Force
General Lee Butler, fomier head of
the Strategic Nuclear Command,
speaking at the National Press Club
on Monday, February 2, 1998 said
“What better illustration of the mis-
placed faith in nuclear deterrence
‘than the persistent belief that retalir
ation with nuclear weapons is a le-
gitimate and appropriate response to
post-Cold War threats posed by
weapons of mass destruction."

The fact that Boris Yeltsin, in an
address to the entire world, together
with a national press release by the
former head of the Strategic Nuclear
Command, expressed anxiety about
a nuclear attack is a clear illustration
that there is, still, a sizable portion
of the ruling class in the United
States which considers “retaliation
with nuclear weapons. , a legitimate
and appropriate response.“ In light
of the fact that the US is the only
country to have actually used nuclear
weapons, no person should consider
RISE’s effort to wake people up to
this possibility an alarmist action.

Mr, Gepner says that a ”Tomahawk
cruise missile and a 5,000 pound
deep penetration bomb... are capable
of accomplishing US goals without
nuclear weapons." Mr. Gepner, who
no doubt considers himself a mill‘
tary expert, should realize that Tomar
hawk missiles are the preferred der
livery system for a nuclear warhead.
The Tomahawk missile is just a pipe
with propellant; it is the warhead it
carries that can be devastating. More
importantly both Madeline Albright
and Secretary of Defense Mr. Will-
iam Cohen admitted that ii non-
nuciear air strike will not destroy
Iraq’s ability to produce chemical
weapons, it will only inﬂict damage
to the facilities making it hard to re-
construct them. The Feb. 5th NYT
says “...even sustained bombing is
not by itself likely to destroy Iraq‘s
ability to make chemical and biologi-
cal weapons." In conclusion, when
Mr, Gepner says that non-nuclear
weapons will do the job. he has not
done his homework.

Sanctions.

Third, Mr. Gepner argues that the
economic sanctions are a product of
the actions of Saddam Hussian and
as soon as he complies with the UN
team the sanctions will be lifted. l-le
completely ignores the fact that the
sanctions hurl those who are not re

sponsible for the policies ofSaddam
The sanctions have not weakened,
but strengthened him, The United
States government commits GENO-
CIDE by the enforcement of these
sanctions. Certainly the indiscrimi-
nate death of 1,5 million innocent
Iraqis can not be called anything else.
As far as the issues of the weapons
and the conditions ofthe UN are con-
cerned, they are a testimony to the
naked and hypocritical policy of us
imperialism. Ier. Gepner had done
half the homework that he has done
in military affairs, he would realize
that Israel is in violation of 69 UN
resolutions, yet. we don’t see crip-
pling economic sanctions on that
country. Intcrestingly one ofthe ViOr
lations is that Israel does not allow
UN inspectors on its soil (the very
reason we are persecuting Iraq).
Why does the US give Israel 30 bil-
lion dollars in aid every year instead
of starving its people? Because it
acts as the US‘s police force in the
MiddlerEast. The United States,
Russia, France, China, India, Great
Britain all are in violation ofthe UN
resolution to not have weapons of
mass destruction, but no one thinks
of bombing them! Why the slaughr
ter of an already starving, poverty
stricken nation? No one can pOSSl'
blyjustify the genocidal policy ofthe
US government towards the people
of Iraq!!!

The Character of the Regime in
Iraq.

RISE does not wish to endorse the
character of the regime in Iraq.
Saddam is a butcher, of this there
should be no doubt. However, con-
sider the fact that the United States
has butchered more people in Iraq in
8 years than Saddam butchered durr
in g his entire 20 years in power, Why
should we suppon a more efﬁcient
butcher? Saddam could not have
dreamed of using such force against
his own people as the United States
has used by killing 300,000 people
in war, and 1.5 million clue to eco-
nomic sanctions, including 700,000
innocent children.

International Law and the Legiti-

"nia‘c‘y'ot‘theUN‘ ‘1‘ “ “

The US pretends that his acting in
“jurisdiction of international law.”
Who is the judge... the Us itself.

Mr. Gepner says “any infringement
of the cease-fire may be met with
military action." He forgot to add
“...by the UN” Clinton pretends this
is a UN-rnandated action but the
United Nations does not support a
military strike in Iraq. Three of the
five security council members—
France, Russia, and China—are in
opposition to a military strike. The
US can not pretend that it has the
support ofthe UN and neithershould
Mr. Gepner. However, the media
sources have misinformed the pub-
lic by giving the impression that the
weight of the United Nations is be-
hind this action. When Mr. Kofﬁ
Annan went to Baghdad to negotir
rite a treaty, the treaty was written by
Madeline Albright. This clearly
shows how the United States govern
ment manipulates the United Nations
to get what they desire, and when the
UN stands in opposition, the us goes
ahead and does what it likes anyway,
Mr. Gepner szud, “Saddam must not
be allowed to get away with under-
mining the legitimacy of the UN."
it is not the legitimacy of the UN
which is at stake, it is the legitimacy
ofthe United States as a super-power
which is at stake. However, I agree
wtth Mr. Gepner that they are pretty
closely related much to the disillu-
sionment of democratic minded
people around the world. Nonethe-
less. to invoke the name ofthe United
Nations when the body does not sup
port you is lying to the public.
Conclusion.

The fact of the matter is that all
those who are democratically
minded, and humane should oppose
this as Well as any other imperialist
slaughter. The economic sanctions
should be lifted unconditionally, for
they kill innocent people ltnd are an
act ofgenocidc against the people of
Iraq. The United States should butt
out of other people's business, or as.
Nelson Mandela so accurately put it
“,..the United States should stop rc-
garding itselfas the world’s police,"
There is a day when every empire
must fall; the price that people ex-
tract on that day will only be com-
mensurate t0 the savagery of the
empire itself.

Sincerely.

An Appeal to the Class of 1998,

In what media nationwide are call»
ing the best job market in recent his-
tory, this year’s class of graduating
seniors faces tremendous Dppol‘lutiir
ties, It is in this context lhatI write
you. whether you are winding down
your job search or are still looking
for the right opportunity,

It was in a similarly booming envir
ronnient in the late ’80s when I was
2| college senior, that I started Teach
For America. Despite the tremen—
dous opportunities. thousands of us
graduating seniors were searching
for something we weren’t ﬁnding.

We were looking for a way to act
on the ideals we had been debating
about through college, for a chal-
lenge that would enable us to push
out limits, for a way to make a real
difference and assume a signiﬁcant
responsibility. I sensed that some of
the most talented and motivated
among us wouldjump at the chance
toyorn a movementto ensure that this
nation truly is the land of opportu-
nity, that hundreds of the most out-
standing graduating seniors would
commit two years to teach students
in America‘s most under-resourced
urban and rural schools.

Teach For America has been every-
thing I envisioned and more. Over
the past eight years, well over 20,000
individuals have competed to enter
Teach For America, and more than
4,000 recent college graduates - from
all academic majors and ethnic back-
grounds - have taught through Teach
For America in communities rang—
ing from South Central LosAngeles
to the Mississippi Delta to the South
Bronx. These men and women have
brought to their schools a tremen»
dous sense of possibility, a conta-
gious enthusiasm, and most of all a
passionate commitment to their stun
dents. They have started extra-cur-
ricular programs, lcd school im-
provement initiatives. and rewritten
school curricula.

They have visited their students’
homes and communicated regularly
with their parents. They have ex
panded the horizons oftheir students
by introducing them to college. and
by taking them on trips everywhere
from France to Washington. DC.
They have had an incredibly chal-
lenging time, but they have also
made a real difference.

I have no doubt that our corps mem-
bers will soon be the leaders who are
effecting needed systemic changes in
this country. Many alumni are still
teaching beyond their two-year come
mitments, and have assumed signiﬁ
cant leadership responsibilities in
their schools. Others are starting
schools or working for education rcr

Scarlet E Blank - Friday, February27

who have moved on to law, medi-
cine, politics, journalism or corpor
rate America have taken with them a
rare consciousness ofthe realities of
our country — and a commitment to
changing them.

I’m writing now to call upon you —
both lhosc who grew up in urban and
rural communities and those who did
not, those who attended public
schools and those who attended prlr
vale or parochial schools - to become
part of this movement and to help
build our country's future.

Think about this: In a recent study
by the Education Trust, researchers
looked at students’ grades and their
scores on national assessment tests.

They found that students in high
poverty schools who reported mak
ing mostly As in English and math
scored the same on the national as»
sessment tests as those students mak-
ing mostly Cs in public schools in
higher income communities. In other
words, kids who are considered to be
excelling in low-income schools are
doing no better, according to the stan-
dards that are cu‘rrently recognizcd,
than lhose who are considered un-
der-achievers in wealthier schools.

We must do something about this
All students in this country should
have the opportunity to attain art ex~
cellent education,

fall under concerts, ACE, Films, or
SEPCS. The money we use is a 73%
portion of the student activities fee
which each student pays as a part of
tuition, Finance Committee .\ci \I‘S
as an advisory committee in hunt

nance Committee is chaired by the
Treasurer and consists of the Assis-
tant Treasurer, thrce SGA senators,
and seven students at large who form
a crossesection of the student body.

The procedure used by Finance
Committee is relatively simple, We
review budgets submitted by regis-
tered student organizations on cam-
pus who wish to engage in a student
activity to beneﬁt the majority ofthe
campus, After each Finance Com—
mittee member has read the budget
proposal, 2t representative of the stu-
dent organization gives a short pre-
sentation to the committee which
gives the committee the opportunity
to ask the representative questions,
Then, in closed session. the commit—
tee thoroughly discusses each bud-
get based upon the criteria of ben-
efit to thc Sludcnts and campus at
large. and relative cost in terms of
our allocated budget. Each budget
is reviewed separately, without re
gard to budgets that the organization
may have submitted in previous see
mesteis, Money is allotted based on
merit and not in the order the bud
gets were submitted during the pre
vious week. However, the commitr
ice only awards funds by priority for
budgets submitted early in the see
mcslcr; these budgets have a better
chance of being funded than those
subtnitted toward the end of the se»
mester.

Our basic philosophy is to fund as
much of a budget as possible. even
when this means not funding it in
full. We would rather fund many
budgets in part than to fund a few in
full.

Please direct any questions to
Jonathan Hjclm or Iess Jacobson, or
vax [SGAZ], and feel free to drop
by during posted office hours. Ifyou
are planning or submitting a budget.
please use the handout titled “How
to Get Money from SGA” which we
have provided in the magazine rack
in the SGA ofﬁce in the Forum base»
ment, Please remember to submit
budgets to the SGA Treasurer's of-
rice by noon on Saturday for con.
sideration by the Finance Commit-
tee ineeting for that Sunday at 4:00
pm. in Forum PDR E.
