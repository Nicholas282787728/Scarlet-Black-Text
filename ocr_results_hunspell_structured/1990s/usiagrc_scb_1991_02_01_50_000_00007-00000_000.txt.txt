When I ﬁrst started school at
Grinnell College, way back in the
revelling days of my ﬁeshmaninity,
I remember having numerous
serious discussions on whether or
not we were actully learning
anything with my other freshman
cohorts. “This is supposed to be
such a tough school," I remember
saying “I don’t think we’re
learning anything, though, in
reality.”

During this past year, which I
took off from Grinnell, I had the
opportunity to take some classes at
Indiana University at South Bend.
1 can now asssure everyone that
while it might not always seem as
though we‘re picking up that much
concrete knowledge here, we're
learning more than the poor saps at
at least one other college.

I missed my ﬁrst Lit class at
IUSB (which also goes by IUES
and Riverside High) beeausel was
busy doing something else. but I
got the assignment, which was to
read Norman MacClean’s short
story on fly ﬁshing in Montana.
For those unfamiliar with the work,
it’s essentially 100pages about this
guy who’s really into fly ﬁshing
and has some family problems.

Anyway, Idid the reading, took
a few notes, and sauntered into the
next class prepared to do a little
decent discussion.

“All right,“ said the professor,
as our class of about20 students of
various ages took our seats, “What
did you all think of 'A River Runs
Through lt‘?" The pmfincidentally,

said a middleeaged woman in the
frontrow. “Page 35.”

Dutifully, we all opened up to
page 35. Someone cracked their
gum with near-professional skill
in the silence as 20 pairs of eyes
glanced over the page in question.

”That second paragraph, where
ittalksaboutthefish thinking about
how to get away from the hook.”

We all waited. The professor
said, “Yes?” helpfully, pushing his
little round glasses up on thebridge
of his nose.

“Well. I mean,“ she said, with a
shrug,“c0me on. Fish don’tthink."

I opened my mouth with the
intention of introducing her to the
literary tool of personification, but
a large male with a backwards
baseball cap spokeup from thebnck
row.

“How do youlcnow that? Imean.
how can any of us know that, you
know?”

“Well, they’re

The debate was getting heated.
People were getting red faces and
starting to make ﬁsts. Over the
noise, apparently in the time-
honored role of education
attempting to ﬁnd order in chaos,
the professor shouted, “Fish- do
they think? Will we ever know?”

Oh, come on, kids- will we ever
care? Will it ever really matter,

A new semester is now under
way with new issues to face. The
two most pressing ones at this
momentconccm the conversion of
allbutoneoflheoff—campuscollege
owned houses (OCCO) into
permanent language houses, and
theneed foraconstttutional review.

The first issue on our minds
concerns an SGA constitutional
revision. Although I very brieﬂy
mentioned this in a previous
column, I will elaborate a bit on it
here. Three years ago. the SGA
constitution was revised, and the
revision went to the studentbody in
the forth a referendum. However,
some things were omitted (I hope
accidentally).Amongthethingsthat
were omitted in the revised
constitution was a provision
allowing for the impeachment of
senators.Allhoughitisstillpossible
to do so, it would require a public
debate in Joint Board that could be
highly embarrassing. Because of
this, we discussed reeadding the
provision that was in the old
constitution.

At this point we ran into a more
serious difﬁculty: we looked at a
copyoftheconstitution and noticed
something extraordinary: it stated
that all amendments to the
constitution had toberatiﬁcdby 60
percent of the student body.
Anybody who knows anything
about voter Iurn~outs on campus
should immediately realize thatsuch
a requirement would effectively
make it impossrble to amend our
constitution. For one, many students
would never vote on aconslitutiortal
amendment, letalone unanimously
in favor of it. Two, does such a
provision include Illo150+ students
who are abroad (meaning that over
70 percentof the students on campus
would have to vote in favor of an
amendment)?

I found it difficult to believe
that such a provision was ever
approved by the students and by

President Drake (the College
presidenthastosignourconstitution
in order foritto take effect). So,on
a hunch, I looked at the srgned
constitution that was under lock-
and-key in my office, dusted it off
and, sure enough, that constitution
stated that amendments had to be
ratiﬁed simply by 60 percent of
“those students voting." Clearly,
then, some change also needs to be
made safeguardlng the SGA
computer file that contains the
constitution; and such a change
needs to be made constitutionally,
Your senator will keep you posted
on this issue.

On to other matters. Several of
thelanguagcdcpartrnentheadshavc
spoken to theStudentAf fairs of f lcc
expressing the desire to have an
honesHo goodness language house ,
system, Although I haven‘t met
with them at thettme of this writing,
Torn Cmdy,dcanofStudentAffairs,
has mentioned to me that if the
houses are granted to them they
will make a very serious effon to
make the system work, including
pumping a lot of language-specific
resources into each house. They
have already looked at effective
systems at other schools and feel
that if a concerted effort is made,
the system will not result in the
farceofold. ' " -‘ " .

However, you mustbe aware
lhatifthis system is putinto effect,
only one OCCO house will be left
for students atrlarge to live in.
Therefore, it must be asked if this
system is beneﬁcial enough to
language students that other
students should be excluded from
OCCO housing. My personal
opinion is thatifitistaken seriously

it may be worth trying. The SGA

poll that we are currently mnning
deals with this very issue. At last
count, out of 16 respondents, l5
were opposed to it and one student
was in favor. Consequently, I would
very much appreciate more input
into this matter by all of you.
Relaying your opinion to me will

please type: “@sgasga”, this will
place you in the SGA Computer
Board.
