Spears: 'We’re Not Done‘

“We’re not done," said
senior Nyasha Spears yester»
day of the large»seale student
effort to find senior Tammy
Zywicki, speaking at a press
conference yesterday in the
Forum after confirmation that
the body of a young woman
found in Missouri three days
ago was in fact that onywicki,
who had been missing since
Sunday, August 23.

“We have a lot of work to
do,” Spears said, identifying
two main objectives The ﬁrst,
according to Spears, is to ﬁnd
more information pertaining to
Zywicki’s disappearance and
murder, and the second is to
“help society" We must, she
said, change the “norm [in so-
ciety] that young women, espe-
cially, cannot walk down the
streets by themselves at night"
She said that we mustas a soci-
ety make certain that it does not
become a norm that a young
woman cannot in safety drive

alone on the nation’s
motorways “That’s our job,"
Spears said,
