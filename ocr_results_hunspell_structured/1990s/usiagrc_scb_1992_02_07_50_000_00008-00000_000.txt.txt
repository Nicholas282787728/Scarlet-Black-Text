Bharati Mukherjee

Bharati Mukherj ee
speaks to Grinnell

By Heather Torrence-
Stanton

The Grinnell College Wiiter-in-
Residence program is lucky enough
to have for its firSt writer Bharati
Mukherjee, an American writer of
novels, short stories, and non-ﬁction.
Mukherjee is part of a new wave of
American writers who are redefining
contemporary ﬁction from a perspec-
tivethatcombines their America with
a non-Westem world. Mukherjee was
interviewed during this week’s visit
to Grinnell College. She will be re-
ttirningto spendaf'tnal week at Grinr
nell later in the semester.

HT: Where do you place yourself
in oontempomry ﬁction'.7

Mukherjee: I think of myself as a
writer who has been shaped enor-
mously and been enabled by the New
World. Jasmine is my seventh book,
and each book reflects where I am
psychologically. emotionally, intel-
lectually. When in 1972 the ﬁrst
novel came out, The Tiger’rDaugh»
ter, becauseI was someone who was
detached enough from India, I could

enough to know that it was what I
wanted to write about. So, that ﬁrst
book is, in a certain sense, an
expatriate’s book not because I set
out to write one, but because that’s
whereiwas emotionallyandintellecr
tually. l was writing about the pas—
sage of an order in my hometown
Calcutta and thinking of it as simply
“my Calcutta.”

I’vebeen writing aboutpeoplelike
me who were non-Europeans, who
were the first batch of Southeast
Asians to come over either as
studenu. . .or to come consciously as
immigrants. At that time, in the ‘705,
the American publishers had no way
ofprocessing what I was writing be-
cause they wanted romantic fiction

about an exotic upper-class India, an
India I hadleftbehind,but they didn’t
want to think ofithey could not think

can social fabric. 1 was writing what
I now realize is “immigrant fiction"
but no one had that phrase and I was
simply writing about people like me.
I was told that mere was no audience
for immigrant ﬁction in the US. It
was only after The Middleman and
Other Stories came out in 1988 andI
wroteanessay inthc New YorkTimes
Book Review about the new non-
European immigrantscoming in with
very exciting stories to tell, that there
was any response from the publishing
industry.

I see my work as an antecedent to
all this hoopla about immigrant ﬁ -
tion. I feel in some ways. at least in
spirit,closer to thenineteenthcentury
pioneer American women’s writings
than to many Indian writers. The ex-
perience I’m writing about is one of

Blazing Saddles

OK. I saw this moviejust a couple of weeks ago. If you like Mel Brooks at all, this is a mustrsec, as it is
probably his best work. Ifyoudon‘tlike Mel. .. well, this is agreatmovieanyway. Brooks takesa no-holds-
barred approach to parody and this pseudOvWestem is no exception. Blazing Saddles will be shown on
Friday at 9:00 pm. in North Lounge.

The Doctor

William Hurt is at his best in The Doctor. His portrayal ofa discasc- stricken surgeon will warm even
the coldest heart. The tears ﬂowed easily. This film, directed by Randa Haines, is a must see.

The Red and the White

Set in central Russiaduring the Civil War of 19 18, this film is considered to be Hungarian director Miklos
Janeso’s best film. iancso's widcrpanoramic long shots set against a vast landscape give a spectacular
choreographed appearance to the shifting military actions and result in an effect which critics have called
“a dream document." “Jancso’s unusual visual style,” one critic wrote, “is beyond verbal description. It
must be seen to be appreciated.” The Cultural Film Series' The Red and the White will be shown tonight
and Saturday evening at 8:00, and on Sunday at 2:00 pm. in the ARH auditorium.

Voices of Saraﬁna

Voices afSamﬁna is a ﬁlm based on the sucessful South African broadway musical "Saraﬁna." It focuses
on the 1976 Sowets uprising which was sparked by school children's protest of the Apartheid government's
attempt to impose the Afrikaans language on youths in black classrooms. The film stars Miriam Makeba
and acast of two dozen young musicianractors and features the streetmusic of theblack townships. Voices
afSumfi‘na mixes segments of the musical, backstage encounters with the cast. and striking film footage
of South Africa to capture the spiritofthecountry today. Sarafina. the school girl upon whom the uprising
centered. is now the subject of a Whoopi Goldberg film presently being made in South Africa. Voice: of

accept us as first-class citizens writ-
ing about a changed American soci-
ety," lam pressured to write political
fiction by a small group who need to
see characters not as characters in
fiction but as role models. I think that
there is also a small body of Marxist
critics who, for theirown selfrserving
interests, have commodiﬁed their lit-
erary theory and need to attack any
non-European writer who is dating to
write a work of imagination, rather
than copying personal experience. I
feel very strongly against those few
critics who want to see my work as a
postecolonial text rather than an
American text or who are into the
death of the imagination.

HT: What writers have inspired or
influenced you?

Muklterjec:Becauselwasbrought
up very traditionally, I have spent my
entire adult lite discarding mentors
and traditions, so I don’t have influr
ences. But, there are writers who ex-
cite me, wntcrs whom I read again
and again so that I feel warmed by
them. It was coming to the United
States and discovering in the Writer’s
Workshop (at the University of Iowa)
other European writers, Latin Ameri-
can writcrs. I suddenly realized how
narrow, rigid, how artiﬁcial, the Brit-

ish model was for the Hindu women
like me who were brought up on
epics ofshapcchanging.ltwasavery
exciting time. The people whom I
like to read time and time again are
Isaac Babel, Flannery O'Connor,
Chekov, and Bernard Malamud.

HT: What are your expectations
and goals for your residency at Grin-
nell?

Mukherjee: Ireally enjoyed the
two sessions that I’ve done so far.

very interesting and informative to
