Professor Reexamines Neitzsche, Critics
Schrift Probes Controversial Interpretation of 20th Century Outcast Heidegger

By Daniel Bliss

While Alan Schrift’s new book _

on the German philosopher
Freidrich Nietzsche is not setting
out to create a fireston'n in Ameri-
can philosphy, it does take some
new approaches in examining the
various interpretations of the 19th
century philospher's work.
Schrift. assistant professor of
philosophy atGrinnellCollege,has
examined in his book,Neirzsc/te and
the Question of Interpretation, one
of the most controversial interpre-
tations of Neitszche, that of phi-
losopher Martin Heidegger.
Heidegger’s theories have been
ridiculed by some, even, as Schrift

puts it, caricatured.

has examined them in
considerable detail, He

mistaken?

“That would be one
way of putting it," said
Schriftskeptieally. But,
he added, “I try nottobe too nasty.
It tends to be a bit of overkill.” He
argued that whatever the correct—
ness of Heidegger‘s interpretation,
to judge philosophy solely on the
basis of right and wrong is very
unwise.

“Ithinkl-leideggerismislaken,"
hesaid, “butnonethelessl think itis

a very good interpretation." He
added that it is this distinction be-
tween good and bad which is more
important to him that the correct-
ness ofa theory. Healso feltthat he
had teamed more about Neitzsche
“wrestling with Heidegger’s inter-
pretation" than in any other way.

Anorexia Highlighted in Talks

By Karin Bellomy

Millions of Americans are vic-
tims ofeating disorders, and about
20 percent of all college students,
mostly female, have admitted to
having eatingdisorders, though the
actual ﬁgures may be closer to 30
percent.

When LisaSueppel,ananorexic.
saw anewspaperada few years ago
asking the question “lslooking like
a model costing you your life?" she
decided to get help for her eating
disorder. She is now a counselor at
Mercy Hospital in Des Moines,

Sueppel and fellow counselor
Mary Kennedy, a recovering
bulimic and anorexic, gave a talk in
Younker Lounge Nov, 28 provid~
ing general information about eatr
ing disorders and about how eating
disorders have affected their lives.

Two Weeks earlier, Lisa Bard
from the Grinnell Mental Health
Center also gave a general infor-
mationtalk,andaddressed the topic
of how to confront a person who
may have an eating disorder,

Victims of the anorexia nervosa
starve themselves in order to lose
weighL Victims of bulimia, who
are often of normal weight, try to
attain the same end by becoming
involved in a cycle of bingeing and
purging; they overeat and then rid
theirbodiesofthe foodbyvom'tting
orby the useof laxatives or diaretics.

. Bard asserted that 10 years ago.
actors and actresses were heavier
than they are now, and she encour-
aged lisreners to look at magazine
ads and see how many ads show
women strategically positioned so
as to cover the “wider pans“ of their
bodies, such as hips and thighs.
Things like this, said Bard, help us
“diston the way we ought to look
like."

Sueppel concurred, noting that
people who have eating disorders
often come from families who are
obsessive about food and body
weight, and that victims may be
encouraged by family or friends to
lose weight whether they truly need
to or not.

Victims do not just diet obses-
sively. They also think about food

all the time and feel guilty if they
lose control over themselves and
overeat. Their lives are Controlled
by food. They often compare their
bodies to models in magazines,
people in movies or friends and
generally weigh themselves quite
often, perhaps a few times a day.
They exhibit selfrdcnigration and
have feelings of extreme inadr
equacy.

Anorexics are often perfection»
ists and overachievers, while
bulimics are impulsive. have large
mood swings and are self»indul<
gent,

“We’re.,,taught in this society
Iofeelguiltyaboutfood,"saidBard,
“But food is neutral; there isn’t a
food that‘s worse
than another
food, and people
who feel exces-
sively guilty over
eatingonekindof
food may be de-
veloping some
p r o b l e m s ,
They’re cenainly
developing some
distoned kinds of
thinking."

Eating disor—
ders can become
quite extreme if not caught soon
enough, even ending in death. One
woman, said Bard, has taken 40
laxativesaday for so long now that
her muscles no longer work in
eliminating waste from her body.
Anorexics may be emaciated, sleep
too much and, in extreme cases,
have a fine white fuzz covering
their bodies,

Anorexics may also get tension
headaches, faint, have low blood

pressure, feel coldmuchofthctime
and stop menstruating. Complica-
tions for bulimicsmay include tooth
decay, and problems With the
oesophagus, throat and stomach
from vomiting so often; uiey may
have trouble keeping food down at
all after a while. They might also
have dry, calloused hands from
sticking their fingers down their
throat to induce vomiting.

At the Mental Health Center,
says Bard, she often sees victims
who are struggling with an identity
problem. The families of these
victims, she said, may have trouble
letting goof them and “haveapretty
clear deﬁnition of what they think
that kid should be like."The mother
of art anorexic,
according to
“The Slender
Trap,” may be
overly judg-
mental and
overprotective,
and the father
might be dis-
tant.

If they don't
live up to their
parents‘ stan~
dards, victims
of eating disorr
ders may getmixed reactions about
how “okay“ they are.

Just a few weeks ago, Mercy
Hospital received a call from the
school psychiatrist at Lin elemen-
tary school in Des Moines because
some children there were starting a
club'for people who were under 80
pounds. Mercy’s youngest patient
so far has been nine years old.

Schrift also gave some mention
to Neitzschc's theories of the Will

However these do not take up large
sections of the book, He argued
that the will to power theory was
important because of the emphasis
it gave to Neitzschc’s indivtdual-

his dislike of the herd mentality.

But, he added, eternal recur-

Neitzschc argues that the ultimate

Draft Counseling

Group is

Mounting concerns over the
American military involvement in
Saudi Arabiahave led to the forma»
tion of the Grinnell Draft Counsel-
ing Organization (GDCO), It was
formed this semester forthepurpose
of raising awareness of issues rc—
latedtothemilitary andtttemilitary
draft, especially the possibility of
declaring Conscientious objector
(CO) status.

C0 status has been accepted by
law since at least World War II.
There is a clause in U.S. law that
allows any man who sincerely op-
poses war in any form on the basis
of his religious or moral beliefs, to
help in a war effort by working in a
civilian position instead of being
involved in combat. This provides
one of the few legal means of
sidestepping a draft

GDCO plans to help students
get draft counseling, This is a
process in which a trained draft
counselor helps a potential dtaftee
decide whether he should apply for
CO status in the case ofa dme If
CO status is decided upon, the
draftee then starts to build a file of
evidence to prove to the draft board
that he sincerely opposes war.

Evidence may include letters to
friends, proof of religious afﬁlia-
tion, antiwar poems and stories.
and a broad range of other materi-
als. CollegeChaplain Dennis Haas
was a draft counselor (during the
Vietnam war)and will be speaking
with GDCO about the process.

Formed

GDCO was started in reaction to
the threat of war presented by the
current situation in the Middle East.
Kris Tapp, one of the founders,
explains thatwttcn studentsdiscuss
the possibility of a war with Iraq,
“people say they‘ll go toCztnada or
shoot a we oft" to avoid participate
ing in a war, because they “don‘t
know aboutthe legal option of con-
scientious objection,”

Education about the option of
CO status, Tapp says, “is the main
purposeof the group.“ OthchDCO
goals include an anti-recruitment
campaign in high schools, campus
awareness—raising about war and a
better airing of the valid objections
to war.

“The purpose of the military is
to go to war and in war you kill
people," stated Tripp. "I think it's
reallycrucialutatpeopleuiinkabout
reasons for joining the military,"

GDCO‘s 8107 budget for this
yearhas been passed by SGA. The
group plans to raise campus
awareness of draft alternatives ac—
tively during the coming year.
