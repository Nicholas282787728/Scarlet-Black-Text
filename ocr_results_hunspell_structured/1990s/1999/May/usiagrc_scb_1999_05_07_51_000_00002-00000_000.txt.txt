programs, never thinking that the same
programs would still be in use as the
century turned. But the economics of
many industries kept the same programs
in use, and that makes manyr especially
programmers ~ question how machines
that control the country‘s infrastructure
will react when they hit the year 2000.

Some machines, in tests, quit working
when they mistakenly assume the entry
“00" means 1900 instead of 2000.

One of the areas of greatest concern is
the power grid 7 which, ofcourse, calls
into question whetherpeople can rely on
such requirements as shelter and food.
While Alliant Energy said earlier this
week that its mission critical systems
have tested as Y2K—compliant(see sepa-
rate story, this page???), the intricacies of
the power grid could mean that power is
drawn in the direction ofcomplete fail-
ures across the system 7 perhaps even
causing sporadic brown- or black-outs.

The net result of all the conjecture is
that no one is certain whether the turning
of thecenturywill beanatural dlsasteror,
in many respects, just anotherNew Years
Eve.

So Anderson sent out a letter on city
stationery last week to Grinnell College,

our national and local readiness to greet
the rrullennium."

Media accounts ofeomputerprogrern-
mers adopting survivallst—like tactics in
their own preparations for New Years
2000 have been a glut on the market.

Anderson’sleltercontinues,“TheYZK
problem is not a programming problem
oreven, to some extent, a computerprob-
lem. The Y2Kproblem is afast, intercon-
nected project management puzzle that
stretches well past the borders of any
organization. The bottom line is that the
impact of the Y2K is uncertain.

The letters call to action: “It is time
that we all turned some attention to the
protectionof the social infrastructure and
the linkages between companies, public
agencies and the public at large. What is
needed now is an open dialogue to coor-
dinate efforts between all the stakehold-
ers in the Y2K issue.”

of course, no one wants to predict
what might come as a result of the meet-
ing, much less at the stroke of midnight
on Jan. 1. “I hope something does come

“I think there will be enough interest and

aren‘t duplicating efforts. One of us can
take one area, another can take care of
another, Ihe hospital can take something,
the media can do something.

This is the second year the college
has received the $2000 award.

On Oct, 24, 1998, over 225 stu-
dcntsfromthecollegehelped23low-
income families. They organized
games, puppet shows and skits for
over 74 children while 30 parents
attended a resumerwritlng workshop
and a cooking class that emphasized
nutrition. The families took home
three or four bags of good-quality
used clothing chosen from more than
6000 items collected in drives on
campus, in local public schools and
in churches. Each family also re—
ceived a full bag of groceries for
Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas

Stewart Library a testament to Grinne/l’s philanthropy

By JESSICA CHAPMAN
Grinnell College ‘99

(Friends ofSrewarr Library have
recently announced an initiative
aimed at ﬁnding more space to ac-
commodale the growth in services.
Mr. Chapman here Ion/tr at the his.
(cry of the library ’3 development to
date.)

The idea of a public library was
initiated by the efforts and dedica-
tionoftheGrinnellcommunitylnthe
earliest days ofthe town‘s establishr
mentin the l850s, reﬂectingashared
interest in education and history.

Early encouragement for the lie
brary was shown by public efforts in
1857 which accumulated 50 books.
Steady interest, shown through supr
portofchurch resolutions and public
notices, led to proposals forthe con-
struction of an actual building in the
18905.

An 1894 Grinnell Herald clip»
ping notes, “Everybody knows that
not only from a standpoint ofpublic
good, but also of individual selfrinr
terest, it Will prove a good invest-
ment."

Joel Stewart, a local cattle farmer,
philanthropist, and former state leg»
islator. donated full ﬁnancial and are
chitectural support to build the li-
brary, and the Congregational church
offered the land. Great town support
forthebuildlngwas motivated by the
suggestion ofthen church Reverend
Vinun. According to a December,
1900 clipping, “A public library is
one ofthe greatest blessings a com»
munity can enjoy."

Cornerstone waslaid May 7, 1901,
and the structure was opened one
year and two days later, on May 9,
1902 to a crowd which included
Iowa‘s then Governor Cummins. In
his speech, the governor praised the
opening ofGrinnell’slibrary and the
town‘s “public»spirited"citizens,and
said, “There is more safety'to the
public in one library than in 100

over the spillway; the cement bridge at
the north end ofthe lake has a fresh coat
of paint and looks great. Many trees and
underbrush along the banks have been
cleared out to allow better access to the
lake for ﬁshing.

There are a number of other projects
that have taken place over the past year
with anew playground in Central Park, a
new tree planted in both Central and
Merrill parks. These are just a few ex-
amples of the many exerting things that
have been happening in Gnnnell.

brary aS truly ”the consummation of

Early on, the library dcvclopcd
particular interest in chlldrcn's edu—
cation, reﬂecting an investment in
the future ofthe community. A sum»
mer reading program was begun in
1929, along with story hour, reading
contests, library teas, and periodic
visits by librarians to local schools,

Through the years, the library has
continuedtoplace valueinchildren's
interests, This fact has been reﬂected
in the library‘s renovations, whlcll
have lent particular attention to the
maintenance and refurbishment of
the chlldren's books space in the
library's basement.

Current library director Lorna
Caulklns says that children are an
important pan of the library‘s mis-
sion and comprise a great uurnber of
their patrons. Story hour continues

In a letter to fultlrc citizens of
Gnnnell WI ittcn in honorofthe renOr
vation celebration in September
I980, Wall niccly sums up commur
nity sentiment toward its library: “A
smallrtowll library is not just a re-
pository for these wonderfully Indi-
vidualistic books, but it is a place for
townspeople to come together."

Wallalso comparedGrillncll'slo»
cal philanthropic efforts to those of
steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. who
is remembered in large part for es-
tablishing the system of free public
libraries across the United States.

tlally due to tllccomlllunltyroriented
efforts of former librarian Bvclyn
Spencer Bray, who initiated a librar-
ian training program for interested
girls in the Orlllrlcll arca.

Though Duulratn admits they were
“a little skinny for ﬁnancing," she
docs not hesitate to recognize the
grcal contributions of the library’s
Board of Trustees and cooperation
on behalfof tllc community to pass
bond issues and gain financial sup-
port for the library.

The role oflhc library‘s Board of
Trustees has been central throughout
the history of Stewart Library, re—
spoilsiblc for the management ofthe
library's ﬁllallccs, and thc oversee-

ing of the facillty. Their efforts are
considerable in light ofthe fact that
state funding for libraries was not
established throughout much of the
library'shistory and there wasn‘tthe
support network and feedback from
other libraries that is characteristic
oflibraries today.

Dunham says that the support of
local media has also long been help-
ful in gaining publicity and support
for the library, She used to write
weekly book reviews in the newspar
per, as well as host a radio show
aboutthe libraryto gainaccess to the
community. Bray said in a 1922 clip-
ping, “The local press has been more
generous than ever in giving news
space and writing up library stories."

The volunteer”Friends ofStewart
Library" organization, independent
ofthe Board ofTrustees, was founded
in 1990 in the interests of gaining
ﬁnancial and voluntary support for
the library. They are currently lead.
ing efforts for the library's expan»
sion. '

Though there is available funding
from taxes under Iowa Code, this is
not sufﬁcient to meet library needs
to expand its technology, nor to ac-
commodate the expansion the facil-
ity is currently facing. in fact, Iowa
is one ofonly eight states which does
not have direct state funding for its
libraries 7 a topic at the forefront of
Iowa first lady Christie Vllsack's
agenda. Currently employing I4
people, the library also has many
volunteers, including local students
whocometohelpoutinthechildren‘s
room. Volunteer efforts, in addition
to helping out with fund-raising ac-
tivities like the annual book sale dur»
ing Grinnell‘s “Happy Days" in Sep-
tember, demonstrate the continua-
tion ofa history ofactive interest and
community spirit, as well as an at-
