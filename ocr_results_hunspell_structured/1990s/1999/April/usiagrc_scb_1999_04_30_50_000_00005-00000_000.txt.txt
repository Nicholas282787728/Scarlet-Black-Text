Bombing will solve nothing:
The NA TO-Ioving lniervenfionisf tells if like if is, again

BY ANDREW CIVETTINI

There are certain things I know. Red Jell»0 is one ofthe best foods on
Earth, duct tape can be used forANYTI-IING, and everyone has a different
take on the Kosovo situation. I am going to take up my space in this week’s
paper answering the letter addressed to me last week by alum Lisa Sergienko
'34 and subsequent claims by our own Zorka Milin.

The ﬁrst point raised in the letter that is problematic is that or historical
conﬂict. I fully admit that I do not know the full history orthc region, and
I would venture to say very few people do. However, the fact that there has
been conﬂict historically is NO justiﬁcation for ethnic genocide. Ethnic gcno-
cide is inhumane, as I pointed out two weeks ago. Whether or not conﬂict
or ethnic genocide has occurred in the past should not be the reason we
restrict ourselves from a discussion ofhow to stop it, no matter who is com-
mitting the oitencc. As per the subsequent comment about the decrease in
percentage ofSerbians in Kosovo since World War II. it must be understood
that the policy ofpopulation
movement was used
throughout the Soviet
Union. 50 don’t ask me, ask
the Kremlin,

Next point. The KLA
does not represent all ethnic
Albanians. obviously the
ones who were drug from
their homes and shot one by
one (as reported by CNN,
NBC, ABC, CBS, and by
the BBC) were in need ofsome protection, although I do not agree that the
KLA is an adequate force. The reason the KLA is not adequate is two-fold.
First, they are radical and atrocious, just as atrocious in their actions as are
the Serb paramilitary groups. Second, they are not impartial. Whether or
not the UN or NATO ate the impartial bodies necessary is debatable, but
they certainly have the potential to be far more impartial than any Serb or
Albanian group if only because of the bloody ﬁghting and historical back-
ground which biases any interpretation they put forth. What NATO did
wrong was bomb before trying diplomacy. Ifyou recall, I too questioned our
bombing. I‘ll get to that Scan.

Now, on to more important things. In had no logic, or no care for
reason, I could allow a conjecture such as the one used to “dissect" my take
on the Kosovo situation. In the letter it was stated that “in 1941 German
bombs decimated Belgrade because the Serbs said ‘no thank you’ and now in
1999 US bombs are doing thesame.” Let me “dissect" this for a moment,
Yes, in 1941 the Serbs rejected the invitation to be an Axis ﬁefdom, and
consequently die Germans decimated the city by bombing it. However, un-
like 1941, when the Serbs said “no thank you” to ethnic genocide, today
they say, “YES!” to it, systematically rejecting an invitation to end violence
in the region and restore harmony. The conjecture that what they said no to
was intervention is even false, because the situation is tremendously differ-
ent, and they were saying no to Germany in 1941 for many more reasons.
This is not to say diat 1 agree with bombing. Again, I will come to that later.

Now that I have taken the time to understand the concerns of the letter

,~.-‘—T';Z_:\

know First, Europe would have loved to gct involved in theAmerican Civil
War There is evidence to suggest that thc French were runding the Conrcd

eracy, and numerous other historical indicators that paint to a desire on the
European side [0 get involved. Had Amcrica not been a continent away in a
rimc ortechnological inferiority, Europe may very well rorced the North to
accept Southern succession. Ifyou’d likc to know more, I can point you [O a
history major or two who can clarify. Also, ifyou are confused about what a
civil war is, maybe you should give it some thought. Paramiliraty groups do
not constitute a body which can carry out a civil war, because rhcy only

represent a small minority faction ota population. Evcn when they do, war» .

fare is conducted by groups ofarmcd soldiers against other groups ofarmed
soldiers. It was agreed by all ciwlizcd narions at the Geneva Conference that
soldiers do not kill civilians. still, this raises an interesting point about the
bombing, which [will get to now.

There seems to be
some confusion based on
what I wrote two weeks
ago, Let me rehash that ar.
gument. (Loosely para»
phrased). We may be
headed towards full-scale
intervention, but is it
worth the price we bear? I
believe there are better uses
for the money that we
spend on our high»tech»

nology bombs. It does seem, though, that there is human suffering in the
region. What can' the United States do? “I say there are two ways [0 go about
military action, one is full out, and the other is fall back, The United States
needs [0 stop wasting its money and start ﬂexing its brain, [0 ﬁgure out ifwe
are really willing to lose lives over mis situation." That ms my argument,
and it still stands. '

I fully agree that bombing will not product any orthc desired eirects. It
will just be an extremely costly means to an imaginary cnd oidesttoying
Milosevic’ powers to wage war. We proved that this could not be accom-
plished in Iraq, and now we are refusing to learn from our Own mistakes,
Somehow in my article, by writing that bombing was wrong because we
should be spending the money here, lwas misinterpreted as saying that bomb-
ing was good. That could not be further from the truth. Ifwe could reduce
military expenditure by halfin mis country, we could achieve a much highcr
level of government services (a good example would be Australia). That would
be superb, and much more desirable than to worry about sending our troops
to a small region in the FORMER (yes, former; Yugoslavia no longer exists,
only Fractional offshoot nations remain) Yugoslavia where they could die
trying to settle a conﬂict Where bom sides are intent on the destruction or
the other, even through ethnic genocide.

So to recap, as I said two weeks ago, an alternative to bombing would be
best, eidrer full-scale intervention or just to let it be, but bombing is ridicu—
lous and costs too much. Spend the money at home. As always lwelcome
any and all comments, and shall attempt to remedy them as best I can (well,
apparently us NATOloving interventionists have a desire to at everything).

 

by alum Lisa, I shall point out a few other things which Zorka might like to

Dear Editor,

1 write to express my puzzlement and distaste following a meeting that
some students, including myself, had with Dean swartz, and to alert the
campus to a developing injustice, nearly fulﬁlled.

Six candidates were up for tenure review this semester. All were granted
tenure except for Mr. Lo, whose case is “still in process." This puzzles me:

In my four years at Grinnell, I have seen him build the small and isolated
Chinese department into an interesting program wim several interdiscipli-
nary courses taught in English. I can attest to his great teaching; I consider
him to be one of the best teachers I have had at Grinnell; he has also been a
good friend. Could it be mat his case was signiﬁcantly worst than the other
candidates For tenure, so that he alone would be denied?

At a meeting I wasn‘t able to attend, President Osgood recommended to
a group ofconcerned students that they bring their concerns to Dean Swartz,
rather than him, since the issue of tenure was an issue of the faculty, and
since at that point he claimed to know nothing about it. Osgood has been
present at committee meetings when Mr. Lo’s case was discussed; his veto is
the ﬁnal decision on whether Mr. Lo will receive tenure or not. How could
he not know anything about such an important case? IfOsgood truly has not
reviewed Mr. Lo’s ﬁle for himself. what use is mere in him attending tenure
review committee meetings? How can he make an informed decision? Is he
cramming tor the test? I give President Osgood an “F" for “comes to class
prepared

We followed the President’s suggestion and met with Dean Swartz. A few

To the editor,

I am writing with regard to Thursday night’s Take back the Night march. For
probably the ﬁrst time, men participated in this march. As a man, I am concerned
that this event, which has historically been an opportunity for WOMEN to cm»
power themselves within their own safe space, will be undermined by the inclusion
of mcni when in fact, the match should support the proactive role women have in
coinhatting gender-based violence.

While I do agree that men have a role to play in preventing sexual astualt and
violence, the Take back the Night match was essentially for women to show their
solidarity in ﬁghting assault and genderrbascd violence, To have men march with
women in this rally is to steal from women a struggle that is particular to their
gender and disempowets them from ﬁghting the issue. Additionally, having men
present at the match does not create a safe space for women. Most instances of sexual
assault are cases where the victim and the perpetrator are acquainted with each other,
and sometimcs where the perpetrator is not even aware of the consequences 0 his
actions. At a campus as small as Grinnell, it is very likely that opening up the march
to men would increase the chances of an assaultot being present. How safe and
empowering would that be for a woman in this raily?? What purpose does this serve
to the victims ofsexual assault and gendertbased violence, who risk conﬁdentiality
and privacy, to come out and match against the vcry men who might be at mar
march??

I understand that
tion made the decision
to input from last year’s

the Feminist Action Coali-
to include men in response
march. I fully support any

points from the meeting

Lhe match is for women to

or these women, it detracts

choices. Questioning Mr. Lo later, I found that in actuality he and Cook
were asked only if there were any professors from within the language depart»
ments whom they did not want to review their cases (Lo’s tenure review,
Cook’s third year review), nor did he know at that time how many people
would be on the review committee. Why didn’t Swartzjust tell us that in the
ﬁrst place, instead ofttying to make the process seem to favor Mr, Lo more
than it did?

Also, asked whether our meeting with him could have any affect on Mr.
Lo ‘s position, Dean Swartz said no, but that he would communicate the
opinions he had heard to the committees. Mr. Lo’s review process is now in
thc hands of the President. (Osgood now needs to approve the committees
recommendation to deny Mr. Lo tenure or to veto this decision.) Why did
Dean Swarrz say that he would communicate our concerns to the commit»
tees when they were already ﬁnished voting? Why did the President recom»
mend that students talk with Swartz in the first place?

Both Osgood and Swartl explained that they would be willing to reveal
more about Mr. Lo’s case were hr: present. However, when I requested a stu.
dent mccting with the two ofthem, mwhid1 Mr. Lowould be invited. Osgood
refused and Swattz did not reply.

I understand the need to carryout an important and conﬁdential process
behind closed doors, but why so much dishonesty?why so much shifting of
responsibility? is there something foul happening here, and we have just un»
covered the tip ofan iceberg?

from the solidarity of dulreauscanditonceagain,
gives mm a channel ofpower in ourtociety. There are the very issues a match such
as “Women Take Back the Night" should be combating.

I would like to clarify that I am not denying the existence ofsexual assault or
tape between women in samesex relationships not do I wish [0 discount the experi-
rnces or maie survivors orsetual assault, but these issues cannot be addrcsscd by
including men in this march. Most gender-based violence and sexual assault ate
insrrncrs armalc perpetrators and female victims. A march such as Take back the
Night has historically been for women, and women only, to express their solidarity
against the predominant numbcr of casts of MALE AGGRESSION TOWARDS
WOMEN. Having men in the march does not in any way adrcss that issue,

Let me restate that I do not deny thc rolt men should have .n (he ptcvcntion of
genderbased violence and tht tolc they should have in dialogue and discussion on
this issue, but mm cannot possibly Contribute to this cause by attending a historl»
rally allrfemalc match that was intended for women to take back a part orthrmselver
that men have takcn away. I apprtciatc the time, effort and commitment, members
ofFAC have put into organizing tht- week-long events [ do not wish for my view to
be seen as criticism oran event that i did not conrrlburc to. However, the ramiﬁca-
tions ofthis decision ditto all oius in the larger communiry, Thctcrorr, I hope that
the organizcrs ofrhis cvtnt will take this view into consideration and retract their
decision to include mcn in turns Women Take Back th: Night matclis,
