ir’s that rime ofyear again; rhe grass

college Dance Troupe's producrion of
Tom, an eveningiengrh piece rhey will
perform rhis Friday and Sarurday, April
23 and 24 ar 8 pm. in Roberts The:

reographed by srudeno, and direcred by
Teresa Helland.

Dance Troupe producrion. According
to Stephanie Sandford '99, “We all
helped ro choreograph, as usual, bur
insread ofbeing separare pieces, all of
the dances are part ofa whole." This
whole is a unirying meme drar Heiland
says is “abour a space and how animals
and humans borh wanr rhe same space
and how they deal with thar." The cho-
reographers do nor make rheir dances
as literal as the theme sounds. As
Heiiand poinrs our, “when we’re work-
ing in the srudio somerimes we’re sorr
ofoverriy lirerai just so rhar we all ger
on the same page, bur we rry nor rs
make any dance projecr complerely lite
eral on srage.” Therefore audience
members mighr rake any number or
diiferenr meanings from rhe absrraer
movements the dancers present.

The eosrumes are mosriy in earrh
rones, bur rhey are hard ro describe, even
ifthey had been finished at the time of
my inrerview wirh Hciland. As
Sandford said, rhey are “somerhing you

really have or see ro boirovr." The mu:
sic has an underlying rheme irl‘perem.
