Mumia Awareness Week finishes with rally in Minneapolis

Campus group
organizes “Mumia
Awareness Week”

By Eric Gable
Staff Writer

Four Gtinncll studentsioined
about 80 people in Minneapolis
last weekend, demonstrating for
the freedom ofPhiladelphia jout»
nalist Mumia Abuglamal,

The trip was a capstone for
Mumia Abuelamal Awareness
Week, in which the Grinnell
Coalition in Defense of Mumia
Abu-Jamal, organized last year by
Paul Ford '02, conducted a num-
berofacriviries on campus aimed
ar publicizing their cause,

The Trial

Mumia Abularnal. a journal-
isrand former Black ranrher, was
charged in 1982 with rhe rnur.
der or police officer Daniel
Faulkner Prosecutors alleged rhar
Abu-Jamal shor Faulkner arrer
rhe officer pulled over a
Volkswagen driven by Abu»

lamal’s brother, and a jury agreed.
Abuejzimal was sentenced to
death row, where he has been ever
since.

However, supporters ofAbu-
Jamal point to a number ofﬂaws
in the trial, including constitu-
tional errors and evidence ofWit-
ness tampering, in arguing that
he was convicted unfairly.

"First, witnesses say cops co-
erced them into lying," Laura
Makinen '02 explained, in an in-
terview last November with
Molly Gardner of rhe Scarlet or
Black. "Second, [there was] no
physical evidence. Third, Jamal's
supposed confession [is question-
able]. Fourth, Mumia was denied
the right to defend himself,"

supperrers say rhar Abu»
Jamal's errorrs as a journalist ro
expose police brutality in Phila
dclphia made him an obvious tare
get for framing. In addition,
judge Albert Sabo, who presided
over Abusjtimal’s trial, was a
member of the Fraternal Order
ofPolice (FOP). The FOP was,
and still is, one of Abuejamal's

most vocal detracrors.

Mumia Week

Last week's schedule ofevents
began on Monday with a shovve
ing ofa video called “A Case For
Reasonable Doubt." On Wednese
day, Ford said, he and 1(ch cos
host Brandon Zicl-ia ‘02 discussed
rhe case on their weekly radio
show, reading excerpts from the
commencement address AbuV
Jamal delivered by rape at Evere
green State Universitylast spring,
entitled “A Life Lived Deliber-
ately."

A panel on Thursday hosted
by Ford and Michelle Gross, a
representative oftl-ie Twin Cities
Coalition to Free Mumia Abue
Jamal, drew about 12 people,
Ford said. Gross discussed her
experiences as an organizer with
the group,

The week’s events culminated
with rrips to Free Mumia rallies
in major cities on sarurday. one
member, Ben Buell ‘00, went to
Chicago to join a 500eperson
rally Ford and three others elected

to go to Minneapolis.

"We always try to maintain
rhe philosophy, go where you’re
needed, not where you’re in ex-
cess," Ford said, explaining the
decision ro rravel to Minneapoe
lis in5tead oFChicago.

Ford said the group’s purpose
in sponsoring last week’s activiv
ties was to educate the college
population and raise awareness
about Abnejamal’s case. "A
couple of people who didn’t
know about the case came to
learn about the case, and are now
interested in helping," he said.

Would organizers change any»
thing if they did the week over
again? "If we did it over again,
wed hopefully get more time to
publicize," Ford said.

He also added that he would
have liked to bring more speak»
ers in from outside of Gtinnelli
but "Getting funds for political
groups on campus these days is
not that easy. " Funding ofpoliti»
Cal groups was a topic of heared
discussion last year in SSA.

Last November, the Coalition

sent about a dozen students to
Philadelphia for a large-scale na-
tional protest supporting Abu—
Jamal, and also staged a some»
what less welleattended demon»
stration in Des Moines.

Execution Nears

Ford said that Abu-Jamal’s
case is more important now than
even

"Mumia‘s case is coming
down to the wire," he said. "His
legal appeals are exhausted, and
we're just waiting for the word
now on a death warrant."

Right now, Abu-Jamal’s law-
yers are pushing two appeals on
the federal level, and Ford is not
optimistic about either of them
succeeding.

"We’re just going (0 get our
and make a lot ornoise, and keep
this innocent man from getting

killed," he said.
