Mapping the Master Plan

When the trustees were in town last weekend, News editors Alward and Mears sat down
and talked with Trustee and Master Plan Committee Member Carolyn Bucksbaum about the
Master Plan: how it _came to be and what eﬂ'ect it will have on campus

How did the master plan process get started?

W h atls goi n g to C h a n ge ? There was a general agreement that there needed to be upgrading

of this campus and it would be foolish to embark in a piecemeal
fashion. To do work right, to not get stuck with things with things
you’ll be sorw about ten years down the road, you need a map. A
master plan is a logical way to get that map. Prospective students
perceive our college in campan'son to all the other colleges they’ve
seen and a master plan is a way to improve that appearance.

 

These changes are only suggestions. Each element was designed to be built independent of
any of the other proposed changes. Even though the plan was accepted, the college is not
required to go through with any or all of these changes. a

' When was the process initiated?

It started before [President] Osgood got here [in the spring of’98].
We were thinking of several different [architectural firms] and Osgood
suggested Shepley, Bulﬁnch, [Richardson, and Abbott], because he
had had a very good experience with them at Cornell. The trustees

Where do the trustees fit into the the master plan?
