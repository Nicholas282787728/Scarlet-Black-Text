These ropics all featurcd prominendy in Anne
Mcclinrock's Thursday convoearion address on
“Mctamor hoses: Cross Drcssin Race and the
Cybcr Body," as she analyzed rﬁe relarionship
betwccn culture and the changing spaces that
bodies ﬁnd within it.

McClintock, aWhite woman ofIrish dcscent
who spenr her formariye years in colonized Zim»
babwc (then Naodesia) and Aparthcid South
Africa, has made a name for herself as a post»
colonial theoretician. Like many leading schole
ars, however, she does not allow these interests
to limit hcr. Instead, she is a cultural critic, exe
amining race, gender, class and, yes, post-colo-
nialism in her errorrs re uncover rhe mysteries of
millennial discourse.

At Thursday’s convocation, these elements all
cams to play in thc context ofcultural represen-
tations ofthc body.

“What I want to do is explore this crisis of
the body as surface and interior," McClintock
announced at the outset of her presentation.
Looking to representations of the exterior and
interior of human bodies, shc concluded only
the exterior can be truly made visible Citing the
Visible Human Project, a project which created
3 D medically exact images orrwo human bod»
ics(dubbcd Adam” an “Evc”,) McClintocksaid
that in creating these images, the corpses the
project sought to copy were destroyed. Shc thus
maintained that the only way to see the interior
ofthc body is to destroy it or to ignore it.

Havin shown that body can not be pinned
down anndgopcncd up without first making the
interior into the exterior, McClintock then
pushed for increased ambiguity in out under-
standing of examination of body -linl<cd traits.
By reducing people to their bodies, The visible
human in the Visible Human Project becomes
well-nigh invisible.” Instead, McClintockwould
like to complicate and expand roles mar people
play, looking at race and sexuality, for example,
as complex territories that cannot be adequately
navigated from an essentialist perspective

Although she claboratcd on somc ways in
which noneessentialist views can be applied the
body, touching brieﬂy on the different motives
and rolcs of cross dtcssers, McClintock con—
cluded thc convocation with an invitation for
potential ncw voiccs to enter into cultural disc
course.

“We urgently need new theories of the body
and new theories of nature,” she said.

Althou h the technological elements that
McClirltoc discussed were new additions to her
body of work, many of the other elements shc
addressed can be found in her 1995 book Impr-
riai Lear/m: Race, Ger/dry and Sexuality in the
Colonial Comm, which looked at the contribu-
tions ofBritish imperialism to a gendered con-
struction of nationalism.

McClintock, who was brought to Grinncll
by the Noun Program, also spoke Thursday on
“Madncss and Colonialism,” in which she
moved across two centuries ofgcnder and medi»
