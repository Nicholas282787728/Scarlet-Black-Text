Scarletijlack OPINION 11

 

the rights
to rent the Lincoln
Bedroom...

By Andrew Civettini

A few weeks pasr, I indulged myselfwirh rire opporruniry ro
rake a srab ar rhe rare for rhe Demoerarie nominarion. i shall rake
a paragraph ro help clarify rhar assessmenr. First. I did nor inrend
ro painr Gore as more liberal rhan Bradley. frankly, rhe Demos
erarie Party has yer in modern rimes ro have a rruly liberal eandi.
dare, Seeond, I do realize, alrhough I appreeiare rhe eririeism,
rhar Gore has nor aered on his environmenral inrenrions, bur I do
feel rhar “talking rhe talk" is more imporranr in rhe eyes of rhe
American vorer rhan a rraek reeord. Here is where Gore ends up
wirh his besrsrrengrh: debares and speeehes. I know whar you are
rhinking, rhar Gore eannor give an cxciring speeeh re save his life.
However, ar rhe “rwo—eonresranr DNC, beaury parade, afrer
Bradley durirully read a prepared speeeh, core spoke wirh some
passion wirhour nores. He paeed rhe srage wirh all appropriare
zeal, whieh placed him as far as he could gee from rhe Vicepresi.
denrial seal on rhe leerernI " Moreover, we musr nor forger Gore's
powerful presence and dominanee in Vicepresidenrial debares in
‘92 and ‘96 Yes, I feel rhar all Care has re do is nor lose, bur 1 srill
am nor convinced Bradley has wlrar ir rakes ro win.

Then, ofeourse, rhere are rhose pesky Republicans. Reeenrly,
rhe field for rhe Republican nominarion has been gernngsmaller.
Dan Quayle announeed Monday rhar he would rhrow in rhe rowel.

Quayle elaimed rhar alrhuugh he mighr be able ro win or piaee in -

New Hampshire on February 1, rhar he did nor have rhe funds
necessary to endure the 18 additional primaries in {he next 30
days. Quayle joincd LamarAlcxandcr and John Kasieh in bowV
ing our, while fellow cop eandrdare Bob Smirh defeered m rhe
us. Taxpayer's Party. This leaves only eighr eandidares, and per.
haps more imporranriy only iwo who have eampaign eoffers over
10 million dollars. (For rhosewho do nor read abour Republieans
for moral reasons, rhar would be Bush and Forbes.) Ofrhe six
loWrbudgcr eandidares, ir appears Par Burhanan may be defeer.
ing ro rhe Reform Parry, and borh Alan Keyes and Orrin i-iareh
are likely ro fairer before mldchbruary. (By lowbudger, i mean
rhar rhey have raised less money rhan our Fund for Forccllcncc
will have rhisyear.) Bauer and Forbes borh have bowed our before
by mid ro lareFebruary in favor of sirengrhenrng rhe parey's
ehanees, so erpeer rhar againThis leaves Bush, pole and Mecain
by rhe end of february, wirh rhe eieenng eandidares' labels of
supporr up for grabs. Some feel rhar Dole does nor have rhe money
to run rhe whole campaign gaunrler, bur ieonrend rhar Elizaberb
Dole may well be ready ro hang in rhere unril nominanon rinre.
Her eyes are on rhe nominarion for viee—rresidenr as rnueh as
rhey are on rile presidenrial nominarion.

Dear sseB,

My name is Cori Zagarell. 1am a senior and one of the founding members of rhe Grinnell Stun
denrs Againsr swearshops, Alrhough rhe group has been working on Campus wirh rhe adminisrrarion
for over a year now, many have iusr reeenrly heard of us. To rhis end, our group has beeome rhe burr
of numerous jokes in rhe soda Some were funny (maybe raking Paul Fender’s wresrling approach
would have been more effeerive rhan leaflering barhrooms. i, personally, am nor averse so relling some
ro “suck ir." I rhink ir was grear advieel). Bur some have nor been so funny. However, 1 wrire rhrs ierrer
nor on behalfofGSAs bur on behalfof myselrand my own offense raken ro arrieles which randomly
rake per share ar rhe eause GSAS srands behind.

i rake personal offense beeause rhis is nor'a passing fed for me. This is NOT my srinrwirh lefowing
rebel aerivism whieh I will quickly forger onee I ger my diploma and move our inro rhe "real world." I
eannor forger abour rhe srrongesr men and women 1 have ever had rhe pleasure ro meer and wirh
whom I have worked for over rwo monrhs rhis summer in El Salvador. For me rhe maquila workers of
San Salvador are nor just workers; some ofrhem have become friends for whom I eare very deeply and
ir infuriares me ro read “cool," self—proclaimed Cynics denounee a campaign rhey know norhing abour.

I do nor know ifanyone has had rhe ehanee ro wareh CNN iarely, bur ifyou have, you mighr have
norreed headlines abour workers from rhe carribhean Apparel faerory in sanra Ana who have eome ro
rhe v.5. ro denounee i<arhie Lee Gifford for whom rhey have been produeing elorhing. They have
come ro resrify before rhe American people only arrer being fired and reeeiving dearh rhrears from
faerory managers afrer ir was found our rhar rhey were rrying ro organize a union in proreer rheir
righrs. I know borh of rhese women. i have earen in rheir houses and mer rheir children. They are
among rhe hardesr working women 1 have ever mer, and so rhink of rho eondirions rhey have so suffer
under gives ME hearrburn. I'm nor saying rhar we should piry rhem. There is no piaee for piey as a
reaerion so people who are hghring for rheir righrs , supporr rs rhe only reaerion. Perhaps ifwe asked
ourselves and rhe elorhing companies, on a daily basis, how our elorhes were made we eouid frud rhe
same srrengrh Lorena del Carmen and Blanca have found.

Thank you,
Cori Zagarell ‘00

Dear Scancr and Black readers,

I would like so apologize for a eommenr rhae, while meanr as a Joke, was rnsulring to people around
me. The eomrnenr made in an saris inrerview on Seprember iOrh abour doing my arr homework
drunk was in poor more for several reasons. Firsr, ir implies rhar i do nor rake my work seriously. This
is not true,

wrrh my parnring l have found a direerion and a sense of purpose. I am in rhe studio nearly
everyday ond am always looking forward so rhe ncxl nine 1 ean ger baek seeond, ir also implies rhar
nobody in rho deparrmenr rakes rlrerr arr seriously. This is also unrrue. ifyou look around rhe Fine
Arts building every semesror rhere is an impressive body orsrudenr work being ereared. Ar almosr any
rime ofday or nighr rhere are many srudenrs slaving away over a priming press, painiing, or seulpring,

Espeeially ro rhose peoplel am sorry sinee i know how mneh ol‘your rime and efforr you pur inro
your work As i am wriring rhis i realize how surpid rr may seem ro some rhar i am apologizing for
wlrar i said, bur rlre irurh is rhar rhere are a lor or really hard working people our rhere who have
soerrheed a lor ro pursue an rnreresr and passion rhar should be valued. Thank you.
