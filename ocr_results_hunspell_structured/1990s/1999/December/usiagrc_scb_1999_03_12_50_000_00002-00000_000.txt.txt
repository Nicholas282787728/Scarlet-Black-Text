The Oral Sex That Changed Our Livos

lremembe-r, at the age ofnine,
watching a PBS special on John F
Kennedy, The program featured
people distinctly remembering
where they were when Kennedy
had been shot, After hearing this,
i turned to my dad and asked him
where he was at the time, He still
clearly remembered the exact spot
and his exact feelings when the
shooting oceured. I asked him how
he could remembersomething that
specific. He told me he remem—
bered because he “was experienc-
ing a piece of tragic history that
would have a profound impact on
the entire nation,"

Well, ldon‘t know where I was
when Clinton was impeached, nor
do I know where l was when he
was with Monica Lewinsky and I
hope that a nine»ycar»ald kid never
asks me. However, someday l, as
well as everyone else in our gen—
eration, might care. Not because
the only event Clinton will ever be
known for is following bush (and
Bush), but because in this time of
remarkable prosperity we focused
on something so trite, instead of
preparing for what is to come in
the future. The attempted im»
peachment, as well as the whole
scandal, may be remembered as a
time when America could have
avoided potential future economic
deprivation and instead rocused on
a trivial event, which had no hut
man bearing on our nation.

As silly as the whole scandal
seemed, it was actually an incred—
ibly costly endeavor is consumed
a year‘s worth of the most valuable
resources or the nation t a great
amount of time from our highest
ofricials and the uninterrupted atv
tension of our mass media. These
two institutions ofAmerican soci.
ery have she power to change, a
power every Crinnellian seems so

culated to a large portion of the stu-

Osgood articulated as she top issues to
students. Keep in mind Osgood docs
receive and respond to email from Stu»

lated were (1) an improved CD0, (2)
more financial aid, (3) a greater Come
minnent to diversity, is) she movement
of the Rabbis posision to a hill time
position, (5) the addition of hands for
smdens acsivides for standing budgets,
and to) an increase in student wages.

Dear Editor,

1 found the facts presented by Mr. Tcws' column this past week to be
rather alarming. The most alarming concern involves a plan put forth
whereby a Residence Life Coordinator position would not be filled when
vacated in May, Beyond the extensive iob descriptions ofeach RLC, their
primary concern is counseling students through the traumas ofcollege life,
I find it foollrardy that this plan is being considered the same yeara student
rook his own life in his dorm room. I find it scandalous that this plan is
being considered the same year that the college's endowment grew by 35%,

I would encourage anyone considering donation to crinnell to join me
in refusing to donate to any fund not specifically earmarked for faculryand
staff. The Board ofTrustees muss seriously address she staffshortages uni-
form to most ofﬁces and academic departments.

Evan Schncll ‘98

Dear Editor,

This is in response to Mr. Tor iansons article entitled “The Lies We Live."
ivrr. ianson seems so have been caught up in Grinnell’s "ﬁght-thc-n-ian" arti-
rude without any understanding ofhow the world really works, He makes
the blanket statement thar all Gtinnellians who go into law, medicine, eon.
suiting, investment banking, or anyosher high-paying jobs, are simply after
material wealth.

Mr. ianson seems to have very little idea orwhat these people do, For
instance, his statement that an “investment banker...spends [his/her] days
contemplating interest rates," iust goes to show how much he knows about
investment banking, i can sell him about an investment banker (who inci—
dentally happens to be a Crinnell graduate) who helped create 20,000 jobs
in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia by investing money into an endeavor of
a poor Vietnamese shoemaker.

Similarly, he bashes capiralism without any understanding ofwhat it is
all about. Capitalism is about allocating scarce resources emciently. 1 would
urge Mt ianson to live in a 3rd World Country for a few years, and dren I
would like to see how he could still assert that freecmarket capitalism is bad.

Mr. Jansen then boldly attacks the notion thas moncy=powcr. He says
that money cannot solve problems, and we should not give much credit to
money, or the people who provide it. I put this question to Mr. Jansen .
have you ever been around povcrty? Only men would you know what money
can do. Only then would you see the many, many, difrercnt ways that money
can make a difference. Only then would you see how there are many hard
working, intelligent people who cannos progress because they do not have
any money/hinding/capital, He further states that giving money is really
worthless ifit is not given with the right intention at heart, His statements
lead me to wonder ier. ianson has ever given money to the poor. lwould
venture so far as to assert shat Mr. ianson,

ifyou were to give iii to a poor person, he/she will raise it segatdless of
your intent, and will be happy with it. Trust me, I know, [have done it.
Your idea that philanshropy must have some higher ideal behind it reeks of
moral snobbery. A dollar is a dollar to everyone, more so for a poor person.

yes, we Grinnell graduates have the privilege and responsibility ofput.
ring our education to the best use possible. Having grown up in one ofthe
poorest countries in the world, I can attest to the fact that capitalism, free.
market, and much of corporatism has far-reaching, beneficial efrccrs rhar
Mr, iansou can never seer ,

Americans live in unbelievable luxury, most ofit because ofwhat Mt.
ianson views as undesirable. because he lives in such comfort, Mr. Janson
takes it for granted, and feels that we should get rid ofthe very institutions
that are responsible for them. Well, let me tell you . she grass is not so green
on the other side,

And besides, what is bad about having lots ofmoncy? some us cannos
afrord to be low.paying social workers that Mr. Janson obviously wishes us
to be, some of us have to support our families with our incomes. some of
us have to worry about “material comforts."

Mr. ianson, you think drat Crinnellian doctors, lawyers, bankers, con-
sultants, are all in irsimply for the money. What you thinkis not necessarily
the rcaliry for everyone. So please stop generalising like you seem to do.
And next time, please sake the time to educateyo'urselfabout nre realities or
the world before passing moral judgements on others simply by clinging
onto tired old cliches. What you think are “lies“ are true for many in she real
world out there.

Sincerely,

syed Faisal. ‘99
