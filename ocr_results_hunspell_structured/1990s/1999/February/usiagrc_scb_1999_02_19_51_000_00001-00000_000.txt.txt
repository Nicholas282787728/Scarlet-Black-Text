3rd area bank robbed;

same man maybe involved

For the third-time since New Year‘s
Eve, an area bank has fallen victim to
a robbery.

This time it was the Laurel branch of
F&M Bank, held up by a single gun.
lnan wielding a sawed—off shotgun,
who escaped with an undisclosed
amount of money Friday afternoon.

Authorities were releasing few de-
tails of the robbery, saying only that
the holdup man was wearing a ski
mask when he walked into bank on
Laurel‘s Main St. and demanded
money.

Asis alwaysthe case when a bankis
robbed, the FBI was called in to lead

the investigation. Also working on the
case is the Marshall County Sheriff’s
Ofﬁce.

Althoughlaw-enforcementofficials
were not sayingthcrc was aconnection
with two earlier area robberies, the
case did appear to have some similari-
ties, includingitsproximrty to the other
robberies.

On Dec. 31, a gunman entered the
Deep Riverbranch ofthe Gibson SavA
ings Bank and took offwith a n undis-
closed amount ofcash, And on Jan. 20,
a robbery occurred at the Exchange
State Bank branch in Mingo in Jasper
County.

Bear bound over

to district

Archie Robert Bear, accused of ﬁrst-
degree murder in the Feb. 6 slashing
death of a Grundy Center man here,
appeared in magistrate court for a brief
preliminary hearing early Tuesday af-
temoon.

MagistrateJlmSchwicbert,aﬂerhear-
ing a bnefrecounting of the complaint
and afﬁdavit filed by a Gnnnell police
investigator, found that probable cause
existed. Schwiebertbound Bear, 30, over
to district court.

Schwiebert continued bond at
$250, 000.

At the request of Bear‘s counsel,
Montezuma attorney Brian Earley,
Tuesday‘s proceedings were closed to
the public.

Schwiebert, in a written ruling, de-
clared:

“Upon motion of defense attorney
Earley that the preliminary hearing be
closed, the court ﬁnds that substantial
probability exists that defendant‘s right
to a fair trial would be prejudiced by
publicitythatclosurewouldpreventand
that no reasonable alternative exists to
adequately protect the defendant's right
to a fair trial. It is therefore ordered that
the preliminary hearing to be held this
date shall be a private hearing pursuant
to Rule Z(4)(d)) of the Iowa Rules of
Criminal Procedure."

 

There was a big turnout here Sunday for the arrival ofatwoiar passengertrain that ran from Iowa City to
Des Moines in an effortto draw more public support for locally based scienceand technology centers in Iowa.
Jim White, local organizer of the event, said about 200 people showed up to greet and tour the train, and
several of them rode on to Newton and Des Moines. "I thought it was one ofthe most wonderful things to
come to Grinnell in recent memory,"White said. "We had the most people ofany place along the route,and
the people on the train were really enthused aboutthe warmth in Grinnell."

In the photo atthetop, the assembled crowd catches sight ofthe locomotive having into view in the east.
One of the passenger cars was this sleek and exquisitely refinished California Zephyr ”Silver Solarium,"

shown with Helen Clausen and her grand—
daughter, Rachel, 3. Recent news reports re-
garding passengerrailservicehave iett local ti
train enthusiasts very optimistic. A Des
Moines Register article on Thursday stated
that it was a ”good bet" that an overnight .
passenger train would begin running be
tween Des Moines and Chicago "sometime

in 2000."

There was a limo whcn our nation
ﬁred up over the birthdays of two
highly regarded former presidents,
LrircohrandGeor-geWuslrington,both
of whom gave us pride and standards.
February was PrCSltlcnts' Month and

Now they have been conjoined into
one day, Presidents’ Day, Monday,
Feb. 15. and more or less relegated to
obscurity,

Lincoln was the president whose
stand oppostng oiir national shame,

slavery, rent the nation asunder btit
brought us face to face with the no.
cessityto change our ways. l-lad hcilot
had the courage to dosc,mightwc still
be enslaving a large proportion ofour
population?

Not unlike many ofour presidents,
Lincoln‘s personal life was difﬁcult
with a trying wife and the loss oftwo
young sons at early ages.

Nevertheless, he was a bcaccn of
goodness and decency and forihat, his
stand on slavery ultimately resulted in
his untimely death at thc hand of an
ZISSaSSln.

His trademark was his rustic sim~
piicity froln his birth in rural Keil-

Felling of trees draws criticism

To the editor:

It seems a bit ironic that the [United Church of Christ 7 Congre—
gational] is methodically removing one ofthe centralbusiness district’s
loveliest features at a time when groups such as Trees Forever, the
Master Gardeners, Garden Club and the Visioning Committee are
trying hard to beautify our community.

l’ni speaking, ofcourse, ofthe row ofcrabapples thathas graced the
Broad St edgc ofthe church s property for many ye‘ars. How many of
us have appreciated their shade in the summer, or the beauty of

. ' winter‘ 5 hoarfrost, or the antics
of the cedar waxwings in the
spring?

i understand that there were
two principal objections to the
trees: 1) they obscured the view
ofthe church from the west, and
2) they created a mess on the
sidewalk. i thought that the re-

moval ofaltcrnatc trees last summer took care of the first issue, and
the second issue surely could have been managed without removing
all of the trees.

I might have suggested that young crabs (with a smaller mature
stature) be planted a few feet further east, alternating with the mature
trees. Their, after a few years of establishment, the old trees could
havc been removed. I have heard that flower beds are planned for the
church grounds. I'm skeptical that they‘ll have the muitr-scason
interest ofthe crabs, and I doubt they‘ll require any less maintenance.

As a frequent pedestrian downtown, I can‘t help but feel that the
expeiicncc has been somewhat diminished. The building certainly
will be visible, but a church is more than a building.

Hanssen the only witness

Poweshiek County Attorney Mike
Mahaffey said following the hearing
that Sgt. Randy l-ianssen ofthe onnnell
Police Department, who friedthe afﬁda-
vit, was the only witness called.

“There were no surprises," Mahaffey
told The HemldRegister.

Next, Mahaifey andco—prosecutorlim
Kivi, an assistant lowa attorney general,
will file a mal information — probably
by mid-March.

Bear then Will be formally arraigned
and a trial date will be set. If Bear
exercises his right to a speedy trial, pro-
ceedings could get underway as early as
May orJune. if he waives that right, the
trial is not likely to begin until latcrintlie
year.

Mahaffey said that Bailey also will
have eta-counsel, which is routine in
ﬁrst-degree murder cases. That counsel

. has yet to be named.

There was tight security at the Pow-
eshiek County Courthouse Tuesday.
Poweshiek County Sheriff John Griffin
has confirmed that there have been rue
mors of death threats against Bear, and
that law-enforcement personnel are tak-
ing the rumors seriously.

However, there were no incidents as
Bear was led to the courthouse from the
Poweshiek County Jail, appeared in
court, then was led back to his cell.

Bear rcponedly has not been eating
much since his arrest. Sheriff John Grif-
fin said medical attention is available if
that becomes necessary.

Incident on Fifth Ave.

Bear, a Tama resident, allegedly
slashed the throat of Max Lavem Purk,
za,ofonindy Center, formerlyofrarna,
during the early-moming hours of Sat-
urday, Feb. 6, in the 800 block ofFiﬁh
Ave. here.

Accordingto Sgt. l-lanssen‘s afﬁdavit,
Bear said that he acted because he was in
fear of being beaten by Purk.

The two men reportedly had been
together throughout much of the previ-
ous evening. When the Fiﬁh Ave. con-
frontation occurred, the afﬁdavit states,
two Witnesses were present, One of the
witnesses reportedly drove Purk to the
emergencyentranceofGrinnellRegional
MedicalCenter.Hospitalpersonnelsub-
sequently placed a 9] 1 emergency call
to report that a stabbing victim had been
brought in. Purk died shortly thereaﬂer.

The affidavit also states that Bear
himself entered the front door of the
Grinnell Police Department and an-
nounced that lic had “just sliced
someone‘s throat." Hethen ﬂed but was
later captured.

Authorities have said that they bee
lieve the Deep River and Mrngo rob-
beries were committed by the same
gunman

Late last month, the FBI and the
GibsonandExchangeStatebankspub-
licly offered a reward for information
leading to the arrest of the robber.

He was described as being a white
male; between 6 feet and 6 feet, 3
inchestall; ofmediumbujild: and wear-

‘ing a navyrblue ski mask and green

He was believed to have driven a
