Throughout this semester, the
sod; plans to feature some of them.
Presented this week are “Millennium,
Morals. Media, and Mayhem" and the
Torah study.

“Millennium, Morals, Media, and
Mayhem" grew out ofa lower atten-
dance at the chaplain interfaith As-
sociation (ClA), an on-campus group
dedicated to promoting interfaith diae
logue.

To find something more engaging
for students, chaplain Deanna Shotb
and Rabbi Deborah
brainstormed alternatives.

“We noticed a craze about the mile
lennium," said shorb. “Take, for ex—
ample. the Christian cult from Den-
ver that planned a mass killing in
Jerusalem this January.“

. “We relt that the media was creat-
ingawrongimage_ notail Christians

the millennium. Just by listening to
NPR (National Public Radio) and
reading the be Maine: Register and me
New Yer/t hmer, Rabbi Erin and I saw
a lot ofconrroversial moral issues be.
ing debated, issues that would be of
genuine concern to students."

shorb and Erin started to cut out
and save articles covering these heated
topics. They then decided to start a
forum for disciosing those topics on

At a typical meeting, Erin and

Erin and shorb start a dialogue with a
few questions. and let the conversa-
tion ﬂow from there.

“The dialogue about the Porter
case was fascinating," said Brin. “So
many questions came up: what is law?
Do we have the tight to put someone
to death? Why do we show people that

had a great time."

other heated topics included the
torture ofwomen in Afghanistan and
the conﬂict in Kcscvo,

DY CYNTHlA ROGALIN
staff Writer

Do you think “real" men don’t dis-
ciiss their icclings7 Do you hold the
common misconception that men to
thy don‘t nccd to talk about issues
ranging from everyday lire to a man’s
role in satiety?

Tire truth is, most men today
probably have times when they feel
like they need to discuss a specific
problem, or need someonewidiwhom
they can relate. Recently, a new fa»
turn for discussion of male issues has
become available for crinneli stu.
dents.

“bridging the Gap," the new malc
discussion group, provides an oppote
trinityfor men oncampus to mcctand
talk about a specific male issue such
”Men and Emotion *'

The facilitators for the group, Resin
dcncc Life Coordinators iohn
Mounsey and Paul Valencic, became
interested in rotmingsuch agroupafe
tet talking with male students and de-

as

termined that therewasa lack ofcom-
munication among the men on
campus.

Valencic previously started a group,

“We pooled our resources and tried
again," said Mounsey. “iWethoughtl
maybe we can pull people from dif-
ferent areas ofcampus to discuss men‘s
issues... it seems like discussion on
campus is oriented to women’s
issues....r seems like we talk about
subiects like male privilege, but don't
talk about the issues such as men’s role
in relationships."

"Men are seen as the dominant
sex...we‘re supposed to know what
we’re doing, [this is] a grave misun-
detstandinginacollege environment.
We never have time to get in.depth
on issues—we graze over the main
issues..,this group provides a safe;
open space to talk," said valencic.

Mounsey added that many times
there is a feat attached to talking
openly, that ifsomeone speaks openly
about an issue, hewill have to defend
his opinion. Mosr times, when some-
one is put on the defensive, he will
"shut down," The group will try to
deter these fears, and provide a corn»
fortable environment for discussion.

Despite the low initial turnout to
meetings. valencic is optimistic.

“By the time we get the right mix
of structure and marketing, we’ll do
