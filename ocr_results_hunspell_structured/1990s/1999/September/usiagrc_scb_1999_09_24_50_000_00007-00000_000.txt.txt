Lellers lo the Edilor

As anoiher year comes inro full swing, we as humble rerurning srudenrs would like ro rake riine our and express our feelings
over eeriain rhings on eampus. We have wiriiessed many rhings sinee Augusr. mosr orwliieh have been surprising in soms way.
We would simply like ro give eredir (and blame) wheie ir is due.

Firs: orall these are a row rhings we ﬁnd slighrly disrurbing

l) Mrcr a month of school bcrh Northern and Sourhcrn Expresses are still closed. This IS disturbing hrcausrt

a) Many rerurningsrudenrs chore meal plans based on rlie assuniprion rhar Express food would be available

b) We like our cookies,

e) Though we undersrand rhe delay is due only ro rlie lack ofcquipmcnr required ro ruru rhe express uiro a “eoiisenienee
srore." we can only assume rliar everyrliing needed ro nin rhc Express rhe old way siill esisrs somewhere.

d) Ii appears ro many as if Dining Seiviees is only sralling because running rhe rxpmsr rhe old way would mean paying
siudenis and giving food in cxchangc for money rliey have from us anyway. We are not rrying io arraek Dining Servicer. In her,
we have many good rhings ro say abour rhe iiiiprovemeiirs made over lasr year. But we reel rhar sonieihing needs ro be done
abour rliis problem.

2) We {car rhar classes haw bécome harder since lasr )‘tal \‘(lr would like to l11WC someone address (his problcin if at all
possible.

3) We, the eoneerned srudenrs orihis rine insiiiuiion or higher learning, do iior undersrand why we niusr be be warered on
me way ro elass. We ﬁrmly believe rhar rlie vasr majoriry oriis lime reaeiied our full iiiarure sizes, whieh is why we are pooled by
rlie arreinprs of die groundskoopers (0 ensure rliar we are surneieiirly war Aficr all, which or us has nor had ro avoid walking
rlarough a sprinkler religiously applying rlie liregiring subsranre ro rlie yery eonerere we walk on?

Despire our disappointmcnlx, we are very happy wirli seseial rliings we liaiie seen rcccnrly.

1) We have been supplied on cxccllcllr assorrmenr of movies by SGA. Kudos!

2) Two Words: Omclcr Bar

3) We were very impressed by Fae. Man’s willingness ro eoiiir ro loiiarhan's room or 11:30 on a snruiday iiiglir ro ﬁx she
holes in his clascr afrrr his third bar incidenr (you may know loilarllnn as [he “silidcnr who received Irsarmcnr at [lIL‘ hospital
arrer being ScnKl‘led by a bar," aeeording ro rhe more in rhe cinipiis Nev- slerrer) We apprseiare die hard work. So dear reader,
we leave you in dosing wirh rhe following words orwisdoin knoii ledge from a eonibined rhiee yeais orsaiiipiis lire I<rep rhesr
words close so your hearr and do no! iorger rliein, Mae Field is saeredl r is our rlie plaee for peer parry rnsli Please keep ir dean

We are rhe smarr ones. We musr go forrh and niulriply. Make more spsniil Melee iiiore sperm! r\nd ﬁnally, pirhaps iiiosr
