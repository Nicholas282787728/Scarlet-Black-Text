Comfort and Company: More

My hrsr forryhve minures of

Comfort calls her

Producer Bergman offers the ‘lnsiders’ scoop

ANGELES

Ir’s a fun game ro imagine
who mighr play you in rhe srory
ofyour life, bur few people ever
ger ro see that game become re.
ality, For Lowell Bergman, irdid,
and he gor Al Pacino. Bergman,
a former producer for rhe cos
newsmagazine 60 Minures, was
ar iiie cenrer ofa conrroversysur.
rounding rhe airing ofasrory on
robacco companies, which be.
camC the basis ofthe ncw film,
“The Insider,"

When he discovcrcd that
Pacino was going ro play him in
riic film version, Bergman's firsr
reaction was, “Far our!’ I mean.
ir could have been Danny
neviro or somerhing."

Bergman was inrroduced ro
the film's corwriter and ditcctor
Michael Mann by a muruai
friend, and Mann was inrrigued
enough by Bergman's sroy ro de.
velop it mm a fcarure him. The
story involves Bergman’s barrles
to get an inrerview wirli ex-roe
baceo execurive Jeffrey Wigand

aired on relevision afrcr cos
pulled it fearing legal acrion.

Bergman's involvemenr in rhe
ﬁlm was limired ro a series of
iengrhy inrerviews, rhen periodic
phone calls from rhe ﬁlm’s direc.
tor asking abour cerrain deraiis.
“Somerimes rhey would do what
i said, and orher rimes rhey
wouldn’t do whar l said,"
Bergman said. "It’s really rhe tier
ation ofMichacl Mann and Eric
Roth, and rhey deserve rhe credit
for purring ir rogerher and male—
ing ir work.”

He did nor choose Pacino to
play him, bur is eliriiled wirh rhe
dccision. “it's nor Jackie Mason,
sol niighrcornc our ofrhis look-
ing OK," he said,

For Pacino, meering the real

Wigand had a similar experi»

Russell's done an exceprionai job

The film shows Wigand’s

side, somerhing rhar Wigand is
comforrable with.He says rhe
him is abour ordinary people in
