Film Review: Eréndira

By Joseph Grim
Feinberg
Slott Columnist

Few films are able ro captivare
our sense of the exotic and rhc
wondrous and ar rhe same rime
ro shed light on some inrensely
real facers of rhe human condi-
tion. You probably have guessed
what my ncxi assertion will be:
Ruy Guerra’s Ereiidira is one of
those rare films.

based on a novella by Gabriel
Garcia Marque-e entitled La
rircrerile y rrirrr irrsrarra ale lrr
candida Ererrdrra y dc sir tint/r
dcmlm/ld/t (Tire lorredrlalr and Sad
Tale eflrirrreerir Er/lulim rirrrl in
l-letrrlesr creamer/var), this
movie embodies rhe essence of
this author’s magic realism. In
fact, she film follows the wrirren
work nearly to the letter, and it
almost feels as ifGarcla Marquee
himself were reading the story
aloud to us. Or perhaps we can
imagine the author's grandmother
(who, according to him, provided
the ideas for every story he ever
wrote) sitting in an old rocking
chair, making up the story bir by
bir, her face flickering by candle
light as we ourselves lie in bed, too
bcdazzlcd and terrified to fall
asleep, Thar is the sort of story
this is_enough ofa fairy tale to
excite our most innocent passions,
but so real that we cannot ignore
the disturbing questions it awak:
ens in our souls.

The film, however, is nor_
merely a colorful reproduction of
the original work; ir is a work of
arr in its own right. The cinema.
rography is breathtaking, evoking
a stunningly barren landscape
peopled by fantasric characters
The music fits the mood of the
picture perfecrly, blending a much
of traditional Latin American
sounds wiih an innovative mod.
ern strangeness. The acting also
is impressive, as the characters dis-
play outlandish eccentriciries in
believable ways. The most im—
pressive performance may be rhar
of Eréndira’s compassionately
wicked grandmother, played by
lrene Papas. Like the story itself,
she both beguiles and repulscs us.

Ere’ndira‘s story begins when
her grandmother holds her rc-
sponsible for a fire that burned
down rheir enormous and isolated
mansion. The grandmothcr cal.
culates Eréndira’s debt at nearly
100,000 pesos worth otdamagcs,
a sum that her “life would not be
long enough to pay back.” but

stroke ofgenius. She ereers a rent
in rhe desert and charges admis.

spreads, and soon caravans form
lines in the sand in-search of the
innocent and beauriful girl’s love.

Still, even wirlr rliis lucrarive busic
ness, it could be a hundred years
before the debr is repaid.

No few words could sum up
whar rhis rriovie is about, bur l
will venture to catalogsorne ofrlie
intriguing issues it brings up, It
is a srory of espiorrarion, ofsex
and oflndians, a story ofexploir—

church. and the poiirical system.
It is a tale of commercialization
