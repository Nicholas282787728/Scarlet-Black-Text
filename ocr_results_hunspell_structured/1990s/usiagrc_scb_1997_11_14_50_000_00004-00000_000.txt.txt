Don’t

BY LIZZ WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

Running in the PEC is like being
on a goddamn obstacle course. In
fact, the entire PEC experience is
something I would generally classify
as unpleasant. Iwould consider my-
self a hcalthy type, cspecmlly by
Grinnell standards: Icat well, I work
out. Iqutt smoking (though I fell off
the wagon this Wednesday, shame on
me), etc. Running has been apartof
my regime formental sanity for over
six years As time allows, I gener-
ally run about 577 miles every other
day. However, in addition to many
other things, Grinnell College does
not provide a friendly atmosphere for
exercise and a healthy lifestyle.
People like myself do not work out
nearly as much as they should or
would like to There is an atmo-
sphere in the PEC that intimidates
nonrathletcs and stops them from us-
ing theequipmcntor facilities. There
is a subtle hostile undertone towards
us nonrathlctes who try to take ad-
vantage of the PEG, though it may
not even be intentional, especially if
we are non-athletes who are not all
athlete's significant other. Thus,
some people never EVER go, those
who would go some-times rarely go,
those who would go regularly go
rarely, and so forth, And when we
do go, it becomes such a big deal that
friends look at us with a kind of awe
and admiration, like we braved the
scary north campus frontier or some
thing.

Iusually brave the cold, tyndra-like
outdoors for exercise rather than the

alternative sweaty, smelly, boring
Physical Education Complex. HowA
ever, when there is snow and ice coVr
cring the town, I am forced to go to
the PEC or risk breaking something.
And yet, on Tuesday, running the
track for a few miles was almost as
dangerous as the outsrde. I spent
most of my time trying to avoid fly-
ing baseballs, basketballs, equip
ment, various games, and otherwise
insensitive athletes rather than enjoy-
ing running as my form of meditav
tion and means of achieving inner
peace. And every time I do run this
track, I run into the same problems,
I’m not saying that everyone needs
to stop what they are doing for a
lowly Jogger like myself. Instead, it
is this poor planning ofthe facilities
and times that needs to be dealt with.
It is the fact that the PEC is designed
almost entirely for athletes and not
for the average student that makes it
so damn obnoxious.

The middle gyin, where the exer-
cise machines and some weights are
located, needs to change. First ofall,
the exercise machines are all falling
apart, especially the stairmasters
(which are boring and a pain in the
ass, no pun intended, anyway).
These are the only machines, in my
opinion, in the PEC that aren’t ex-
clusively there for the purpose of

.trainin g Division III athletes. Maybe

that’s why, The two new treadmills
were originally donated to help the
men’s track team and are almost at-
ways in use. (Please remember that
these are the only alternative to run~
ning on the track in the main gym
and dealing with the aforementioned
problems.) The rowing machine and
exercise bikes, like the stall-masters.

are rusty, falling apart, and, conse- '

quently, hard to use. The weight
machines have no instructions on
them, nor do they show which
muscle groups they work on. Most
(actually all) gyms I‘ve been to have
both of these pieces of information
on the machines so that the non-foot—
ball»player-type can use them. The
free weights are as good as free
weights can be (I think), though in
order to use them, you have to go

lt‘s arrived. It's the time of year
marked Willi some sadness, but
mostly‘j'u‘st apathy. Every year about
this time. the student body collece
lively discovers a commodity more
precious than Chicken' Patty
Parmesan or alcohol: Sleep. We
huddle over our styrofonm cups of
Forum coffee, lamenting that our en-
tire $80 meal plan motley has been
allotted to the beastly brown liquid,
knowing that the only alternative to
this jittery state of caffctnatton ts
coma Lani convinced that on cer-
tain Friday mornings 'like this one,
that the collective slcep total of the
campus is less than 30 minutes, Ifthc
Health Center had a true understand—
ing ofthe campus at this time during
the semester, they wouldn’t bc giv-
ing out 2 [Ice condoms to anyone
who asked. they would be passing
out No-Doz

It is now that we begin to ask the
agcrold question: “Why is it that the
only time I cltn fall aslccp is in
class?" Ofcourse, this question is not
strictly accuratc. There are actually
two places one can fall asleep: sit-
ting in class, and “studying" in the
library. Known as the Burliiig Guilt
Nap, the practice has become an art
form First. the offender takes It large,
uninteresting book (often found in
humanities, science, or'social science
classes) and curls up iii an awkward
fetal position on the second floor
couches This is followed by approxi-
mately 7 minutes of concentrated
effort in which the offender reads the

same paragraph 12 or 13 times. The
offender then falls into an uneasy
nap, which is terminated by some
random limb ﬂailing out in an em-
barrassing manner, which then must
be justified by pretending to be ﬁxr
ing hair, turning pages, or crossing
legs. The process is repeated indeﬁ—
nitely, or at least until the library
closes.

Some people seem to ﬂaunt the
amount of sleep they get per night,
skipping in a sprightly manner into
their 8 am. class, saying dangerous
things such as: “Wow! I am SO RE-
FRESI-IED! I went to bed at 7 pm.
last night!” These people often end
up mysteriously transferring to other
colleges at the end of the semester.
There are also similarly annoying
people who pornt out your severe
sleep deprivation: “Wow, you look
terrible! I mean, I totally understand
how you could be tired. I was up until
llp.m. last night ﬁnishing up my 23-
page seminar ﬁnal paper that my pro-
fessor has already asked me to read
at a conference in the Caribbean."
These people do not usually make it
to the end ofthe semester before they
mysteriously transfer.

For the rest of us mortals, life is
slightly less idyllic. I’ve discovered
that discussion classes have become
forums for professors to make snide
comments about our lack of parttclv
pation. On occasion, they entirely
revise syllabi to punish us, (“1 see no
one has anything insightful to say
about the reading for today. Perhaps
this pop quiz, which I will use as the
basis for 75% ofyour grade, will re
fresh your memory")

Unfortunately, there's no hope. It
only gets worse from here on out. We
may be able to console ourselves by
telling each other that the necessity
ofsleep is merely an old wives’ tale,
a myth fostered by mattress compar
nies for centuries. I doubt I‘ll be con-
vtnced. You'll ﬁnd me in Burling,
curled up on a second floor couch
with a Norton Anthology I‘ll be the
one ﬁxing my hair.

through a sea of muscle men who
look at you funny because you are
not one ofthem and still want to lift.
While exercising, there is little to
keep you occupied unless you want
to look at this sea of muscle types.
The old music stands provided near
the exercise equipment do not hold
material well and shake a lot, thus
making reading stuff even harder
than it already is while exercising.
Also, there are no cheesy magazines
like most gyms have to read while
working out » Self, Glamour, YM.
Cosmopolitan, etc. Even the Health
Center gets these! And, of course,

pretty much unavoidable. Idea for
fun: go In to the middle gym some
day, turn off the buttrock radio star
lion, put in your Phish tape, and
watch the muscle men’s expressions.

The PEC really needs to get some
nonecredit classes too, What hap-
pened to the yoga classes of my ﬁrst
year? It would be nice to have some
sort of holistic—mediation-relaxation
class since this school really doesn‘t
know how to relax without chemical
help. And it Wouldn’t even have to
be through EXCO, either. I know
that this semester's EXCO massage
class was really hard to get into. This
must say something about Grinnell}!

So anyway, my point is that in a
small, stressed out, liberal arts colr
lege, there is a huge need for a lion
athletic outlet for exercise and other
body-happy activities. Suggest it to
your SGA senator. Write an initiae
tive. Last year I heard an suggestion
that the Forum should be changed
into a bar/bath/grill. But really, I’d
just settle for a hot tub in the swrmr
ming area.

Goodbye sesqutccntcnnial Pam,
The time has come to subtract your
variable from our equation. So good
at adding up the numbers, but you
never even say hi to me on the street,
And with all this talk ofwhy you‘ve

that's wrong, the administration in
silence seems to accept the blame,
The attacks won't stop With the news
of a resignation. We all know the
problems go deeper than you. But
what disturbs the the most is how
little anyone in those ofﬁces seem to
care. Doesn‘t it upset you thatpeople
think you were fired for hiring too
many lesbians and bisexuals? Such
nonsense would sure bother me. And
what about Tom Crady'.7 What is he
thinking when his latest stop-gap
solutions are dismissed as lies and
manipulative halfrtruths7 Is it OK
that students feel this way? Do you
feel so secure in your positions of
power that the thoughts of those he-
neath you are insigniﬁcant? Do you
think you need only please those with
more power than you? Those who
sign the checks and bloat your ores
denLials? Do you wonderhow things
got so bad? Do you wonder why

An Opened Letter

George Drake has a smile on his face
in all those old pictures? Why he
looks comfortable in the presence of
students?

There has to be respect among stu-
dents for administrators and among
administrators for students. The ad-
ministration must earn it; for the stu-
dents it should come with their ac»
Ceptzince letter. It is their campus,
not yours. Students are what this is
about, young intelligent individu-
als who Iteed help in ﬁnding their
way to a better future. And perhaps
your intentions are good, perhaps
you think that by forcing them down
the narrow path you have attempted
to structure in the past six and a half
years you are pushing them into that
better future, but it is not working.
That future you are planning is no
place to go. Listen to the students'
cries, look at them all breaking
down along the way! It is the inevir
table consequence of forcing false
ideals on people. Nothing false will
succeed, and for an academic instir
tution to function at that standard
(normally reserved for the federal
government) leaves the most edur
cated of people completely blind to
the truth. All that is being learned
here is that critical thought is mean-
ingless and depressing. prody is
listening except for the others who
have been pushed aside by an exclur
sive system and who watch as pow—
erless as me as the powers that be
marchrto their heat, which beats so
loud, which beats us all down, the
beat which makes artists. Allen
Ginsberg said “America, you made
me want tobe a saint," and I wonder
if our little college is looking to do
the same. Is the ridiculous nature of
your governance designed to stir us

Racial Slurs Should Not Be Taken Lightly

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Editor-imChief

Remember for a moment a hostile
environment you’ve encountered, or
imagine a situation in which you’d
feel uneasy and threatened. What
words come to your mind, reﬂect-
ing on this place or event? Power-
lessness’] Frustration? Does your
sense of selfrworth suffer?

Incidents like the racist vandalism
that occurred two weekends ago in
Grinnell create such an environment
for students ofcolor on this campus.
It doesn't matter that the slurs
painted on a student‘s car were prob
ably the work ofonly a few individur
als - it is impossible to exaggerate
the importance of this crime to the
lives of students of color on our cam-
pus.

I have African American friends
who were scared to walk through
Grinnell alone at night as a result of
the vandalism. They‘re right to be
scared 7 who knows when they

might run into the people who per-
p'etrated this crime, and who knows
how these people might be willing
to back up their words in action?

I know and have heard ofmany stu—
dents of color who have been the tar—
gets ofracial slurs yelled from pass
ing ears as they walked down the
street. These incidents have had the
same debilitating, fear-inducing ef
fects. ,

Are these outrageously racist acts
not that important? Haven‘t they
drastically changed the lives of a sig-
niﬁcant portion of our student body
for the Worse? Doesn't the practi-
cally nonrexistent public response of
the community to this racism, as well
as the very occurrence of publically-
expressed discriminatory sentiment,
prove that racist feelings exist in our
community?

In response to MLE Davis's letter
to the editor, I would like to assert
that the Scarlet and Black was more
than justified in making this a head-
lining story. This event and others
like it have had and will have dire

effects on the lives of students who
are being forced to study and work
daily in a harshly hostile environ-
ment. Keeping in mind that quota—
tions in stories do not necessarily

reﬂect the feelings of a newspaper,

staff, I maintain that] in no way sug-
gested that the townspeople or stu-
dents of Grinnell supported the ac-
tions of the vandals. However. the
perpetrator of this crime almost cer~
tainly came from our community,
and therefore represents racist sen-
timent that exists among us.

The community of Grinnell — stu-
dents, faculty, staff, and townspeople
7 must prove that they do not sup-
port and will not tolerate racist i
timidation by calling attention to in»
cidents like the vandalism ofRandnll
Lahann‘s car. Grinnell College and
the town of Grinnell must recognize,
condemn, and prosecute, if neces-
sary, the many manifestations of rac-
ism around us, instead of skirting
another painful but powerfully im-
portant issue.

We have moved the house, poured the foundation, built bath-

to action, to let us ﬁnd our collective
critical voice? Has your silence been
a test, to see if we would ever ﬁnd
the right words?

Why must this opposition exist? It
is a horrible distraction to the cause
oflearning, Distrust of the adminis»
tration leads to distrust of the faculty,
who in silence are equally open to
the same blame. and now we see diSr
trust amongst students, inﬁghting
between cultures and races. Is her
body on the same side here? Is no
body committed to the basic ideal of
education? Has it all become indoor
trination’!

The students are not always right. I
am most certainly not always right
(I am twenty four years old and cv»
eryday I discover another mistake in
my past) and it is abundantly clear
that you are not always right. All of
us must face up to our errors. Some-
times it is necessary to step back. And
if I am wrong about the
administration‘s lack of concern for
students (and I do hope I’m wrong)
let me know, let the students know!
What a horrible place Grinnell is
becoming. With all the open space
of Iowa, it‘s wrong to feel con-
stricted, to feel the walls caving in. I
feel it is my responsibility to break
through those walls. I am Lrying to

out! Talk back! Don’t let power hold
you back: the power you have, the
power you feel. As Bob Dylan sings,
“Even the president of the United

naked." Sometimes you got to let it
all hang out no matter what you have
to lose.
