A Foolish Consistency Don’t Ask Mei I’m Just A Girl

BY IVY CHANG
Columnist

Wow, Hasn't time flown by'.7 Less
than a month from today, I will be
setting foot in LAX (LosAngeles In-
ternational Airport) once again.
Scary stuff. So much has changed lil
such a relatively short amount of
time. 1 have ohanged and while many
ofthe people in my life have changed
with me, I know already that some
have not and my relationships With
those individuals will never be the
same,

My friends and I have scattered
across the country at various colleges
and universities and through the
miracle of e-mail. I have kept in
touch With most (maybe even With a
few more than I would have chosen
to thanks to those damn people who
get your address off of mailing
lists...), but also lost touch With some.

I think ofthose lost ones from time
to time. Think about looking up their
respective schools on the web and
getting their e-mail addresses. or
even supporting the US Postal Sere
vice with a generous $0.32 contribu-
tion. Then my schedule ﬁlls up with
classes and meetings and swnnming
and eemailing and all ofa sudden two
weeks have gone by and l have an:
other column due and lstill haven't

. heard from them or talked to them
and begin to wonder if I over will
again. Or, three months go by and
it's almost time for me to go home
and I start thinking about the others,
the friends I have kept in touch with,
the ones I will see in a month, and
consider what we Will have to say to
each other,

There’s my one friend from high
school who came to Grinnell with
me, with whom I know I will o-‘e good
friends until the end or'time. The
eerie parallel lives we lead will en-
sure that. though going to the same
school (which is part of that whole
parallel life thing) deﬁnitely helps. I
always tell her that she’s the only one
ofmy good friends that I would have
wanted to go to school with, and I
really mean it. You know who you
are. “Never lose the wonder." My
“Grinnell experience" wouldn‘t be
the same without you.

Then there’s my friend at UCLA.

Co»cditor-ln-chief0ftllc high school
yearbook with the last year. Least
likely to be mistaken for my twin,
though that's what Wejokillgly called
ourselves. Blond, blue-eyed, S'IO”
to thy 5%”, Swedish, vegetarian,
California girl has gone andjoined a
sorority, Ofall things or all people.
I never would have thought, that’s all,
But who am I to judge? I chose to
attend Grinnell partly out of an aver-
sion for [lie Greek scene, but maybe
that's what she wanted. I can be
happy for her, but I can oltly stom-
ach so many e-lnails about sorority
functions before I begin to ponder
what we'll have to talk about when I
see her again We are having such
disparately different college experi—
ences and we have made such dras—
tically differentdecismns in ourllves
already, I wonder if we really have
anything in common anymore.
Would we have stayed closer if we

had gone to more similar schools? _

Or do our decisions to attend the
schools We do and to become in
volved in the activities we are say
something about our differences to
begin with?

But I ﬁnd that those differences
have not hindered all my relation
ships. The experience my best friend
at Boston U. is having at the Pet-
forming Arts School there is prob-
ably the furthcst thing from anything
I have experienced. or will ever ex—
pelience at Grinnell. Yet I ﬁnd that
with a few emails and an occasional
phone call. we are as close as we ever
have been. We will be friends for life
because our relationship goes deeper
than a collective experience. We’ve
both grown and changed, but some»
how managed to do so together, de
spite the fact that we’re apart,

On the other hand, I know that my
friendship With someone at Reed is
stronger as a direct result of the fact
that we have bonded over our com»
nton small liberal arts college expe~
rience. We can relate to each other
in the face of many of our friends’
large university experiences, If she
had chosen to attend a university, our
twelve-year relationship, long as it
IS,‘;\,VO_UICI‘[7‘|’, bably‘ hpve ‘co tinned
to weaken.‘ So"here is Van'i'n'stance
where circumstances have served to
further a relationship that may or
may not have had anywhere else to
go. but I’m pleased that she has
stayed in my tire, regardless of the
reason.

As for everyone back home—my
teachers, my friends who are still in
high school, my friends who still live
in town, Working or going to com-
munity college or bothiwhere do I
lit in that community anymore?
Sometimes I think I’ve forfeited my

niche there. I’ve given it up in my
pursuit for higher education, my re-
solve to go beyond my little sheltered
community. (I know what some of
you must be thinking. Forwhatl you
ask. In exchange for another shel»
tcred community? ldisagree. At least
I know that my stay here is limited
to four years, and I‘ve taken a step
away from complacency, left the
nest. and am headed towards my fu—
lure) My decision has made it im-
possible for me. with the exception
of an occasional vistt, to ever go
back. My future no longer lies there
and I know it. So where is my place
now?

How did I come to find myself in
this twilight zone? Now. no matter
where I go, I will be missing some-
one or something. My home is where
the people I care about are and in that
Way I belong both here and there, yet
not wholly in either. Despite the com-
mon delusion many of us have that
we are stuck at Grinnell forever,
when you think about it, Grinnell is
really a very temporary community.
We get kicked off campus three times
a year and every year there are three
hundred new people to meet and
three hundred more people to miss.

Once you meet all the new people,
you have fun here while missing the
people back home, plus the people
that graduated Then you get sick of
the people here and miss all the
people back home even more. So you
go home and visit your friends and
find that you’ve grown apart from
some of the people you least ex-
pected to so you get all depressed and
start missing the people at Grinnell.
So you come back and the cycle
starts all over again, and, all the
while, you’re still missing all the
people who graduated, whom you‘ll
never see all in one place again.

Depressing, isn't it? So, my point
is, ﬁgure out who your real friends
are, who is really important to you,
and appreciate them now, while
they're here in your life.

This column is dedicated to all my

friends. everywhere. I love you guys.

Tales From Another World

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

It begins with the scent of ganja ris-
ing, in vertical streams ascending,
the horizontal passage into anxious
lips awaiting the fresh cool rush of
mellow herb aflrc. It begins iii the
field witlt the man and his pipe, sit-
ting amongst grass and critters. and
full of the song sullg round and
round through the seasons. It begins
With the lighter’s spark and the
crackling of leaf. What begins,l It
begins.

Charlie on his back staring, scotch-
ing the empty sky forclouds, follow-
ing his nature. tries his best not to
Wonder. He is looking for it cata-
tonic spacc. he is trying to rid him-
self of thoughts. All his life cone
strucied of thoughts and he was not
happy there. He did not like the
world around, the attitudes and ex-
pectations. He did not like the deli-
nitions ofsuccess, he did not like the
differentiation of beauty He could
not stand the guidelines for reason,

the rigidity of right and wrong. Of
tltls lnind, Charlie saw the world and
felt it destroying him, squeezmg out
the life he knew to be within him,
denying him the life of boyhood
dreams Hc decided on escape, to
skirt the issue by dropping out. “All
oflife is mind so ifthcir world is out
ol'mind it is out oflifc," he thought,

Charlie on his back staring had trav-
cllcd from that self. In smoke he had
di-irted away and found new eyes
thiting, New eyes seeing new vi.
sions and their new mind, Good and
bad, Charlie drifted, trespassing on
American grouild in his altered state,
guided by new dreams and new
awareness, but still without the
means to deal, It was still an angry
World, and he was still a small force
pushing ga'lnst the firm foundation
of lllttllrm'ddc earth,

Clltilllc on his back stoned found a
new world. A world which welcomed
llilit. which he welcomed. In the
smoke he found perspective. in the
smoke all the world appeared differ-
ently, it was the only world hc could
see with his two eyes squinting. In a
field on his back the sky is blue and
timers someone else’s. Beneath the
raging sun he knows contentment, he
knows beauty, and it all the world he
sees. With a joyous mind, his secke
ing eyes see to the center of every
moment. In a mariyuana haze Charlie
knows what he wants of the world.
He wants contentment. and in a marr
juiina haze he comes to understand

his mind, understanding that it is the
key to the contentment, not the built»
up bridges and barriers of right and
wrong, good and evil, and it could
have been anything that ﬁrst brought
Charlie to this realization, medita»
tlon, religion, a hook or movie, an
old else uncle. a newborn baby, but
it was pot. Charlie got high and it
helped. It made his life worthwhilei
not that pot became the Worth of his
life, but that pot gave him access to
a life with different character and
standards, it revealed a world he
could live in. and make a difference
in, a world emanating from his mind
of contentment, a world existing
solely in the present. This won‘t
make money and it won’t pay rent,
it Won’t contribute to the GNP, but it
won’t kill earth and it Won't drain
souls. This World forces people to
make a choice: go along or step
aside. Charlie just wants to step
aside.

Charlie on his back worthless to
some. in his mind beyond worth.
Charlie ofone mind, you ofanother.
One says nothing of the other. It is a
matter of opinion, it shouldn’t be a

roflaw.

Ifyou are reading this on Friday. as
all my loyal fans do, a Week from
today is the biggest shopping day of
the year... THE DAY AFTER
THANKSGIVING. The second big—
gest is the day after Christmas, when
people buy what they really want.
Aaaah. Capitalism. Being the good
American Studies major that I am, I
like to go to the mall each big shop-
ping day to look at the crowds. of
course, because] live in such a small.
rural, isolated town, the crowds are
kind of scary too. Thousands upon
thousands of desperate. spiritually»
empty suburbanites all gather to go
to Mayfair Mall and shop for gifts to
ﬁll the missing Void...and then there’s
me, who goes for the sake of look-
ing down at them with an elitist atti-
tude of Grinnell anti-materialism.

malls, I especially hate Mayfair. I
think I go because it makes me real—
iZe Why I like Grinnell and that no
matter how many papers I have to
write, how cold it is, how lonely it
is, and how little I’ ve slept, at least I
don’t work at the Gap or Cinnabun.
Of course, as a product of the sub-
urbs. I do succumb to the call of the
capitalism and ﬁnd myself at used
CD stores for a good two hours the
ﬁrst day I get home. But really,
sometimes you really need new mue
sic.

So anyway. the biggest shopping
day of the year is in only a week.
I've even noticed a change in the
commercials. I Want the bouncing
baby doll 1 keep seeing advertised
during the Simpsons, It bounces! It
gigglesli It's all you could ever ask
for and more. Well, except for the
take apart Jurassic Park dinosaurs.
And maybe the new Little Mem‘iaid
doll. And maybe Just My Size
Barbie. Actually. what Ireally Want
is an Easy Bake Oven. I asked my
mom for an Easy Bake Oven and she
taught me how to cook instead. My
first year here I finally got my
Snoopy Snow Cone Machine. I had
been asking since I was four. I was
the happiest girl in the whole world.
Of course, the magic of the Snoopy
Snow Corie Machine was the syrup.
Iwas thoroughly disappointed when
I found out that all the syrup is is
Kool Aid. We ﬁxed the problem

upon airivmg back at school with a
stolen bottle of cherry Torani. Back
to the topic of holiday commercials.

How about commercials, in gen-
eral? If] see that goddamn Pepsi
supermodel baby commercial again,
heads are going to roll. And why is
the szm team using supermodels to
promote their meet this weekend? Or
should I say “meat”? Aren't women
objectified enough in this world? I
would hope that in a such a PC
school, I could be better protected
from the evils of a patriarchal, me»
dia-run society. Isn’t that the pur»
pose ofthe new body image support
group? Isn't this why I’m taking an
independent class on female imag-
ery in Western society?

And I know I keep saying this. but
I really can’t stress it enough...
People, NO ONE WANTS TO
WATCH YOUR FDA. I know it’s
cold and you need to keep warm.
Why do you think so many relation-
ships start in winter? But please.
keep warm in your fucking room. No
pun intended. The library is no place
for lovin’, Nor is ARI-I. Nor is the
Forum. Nor is Harris. Nor was that
party in Loose a couple weeks ago.
You know who you are. Especially
because I was making vomit noises
every time I saw you kiss. I’m glad
you’re in love. I‘m not. Just stop.
You’re making the rest of us sick.

 

Letters _
to the Editor

Dear Editor.

We are writing the following letter
because we think it is important that
the campus community is informed
of actions regarding global warming.

On December 1. President Clinton
and the rest of the world leaders will
meet in Kyoto, Japan to decide bind
ing proposals on harmful greenhouse
gas emissions. President Clinton

recently proposed standards to re-
idlioe' these emissions to'iaa‘o levels” "

by 2012, amove which the environ-

mental community, most European‘

nations, and Japan claimed was out-
rageously inadequate.

Despite the media’s portrayal of the
uncertainty of global warming,
nearly every scientist that is not
funded by a major corporation has
agreed that humans are having a dra-
matically detrimental effect on the
earth’s climate. 2500 scientists have
concluded that the effects of global
warming include the following: ris-
ing sea levels, droughts, more in-
tense tropical storms and an increase
in infectious diseases such as ma-
laria.

As a candidate in 1992, Clinton
promised strong leadership on gloe
bal warming. As with most other
environmental issues. Clinton has
provided little more than lip service.

This issue concerns students more
than anyone else because it is us who
will have to live with the effects of
decisions made at this conference.
Clinton's actions should reﬂect the
impact on ourselves, future genera-
tions, and the earth, rather than the
C.E.O.s of oil and chemical compa—

nies. Make Clinton hear

from you by e-mailing him at
president@whitehousegov. Make
sure your voice is heard in Kyoto.
Sincerelyi

Free the Planet!

Dear Editor,

Coach John Pfitsch retired on
Tuesday November 11th ending 50
years of coaching at Grinnell Col—

lege. His decision'ended an era dur— ,

ing which he touched the lives of
thousands. Perhaps that he was a
coach by title denotes that his reach
extended only to athletics and ath-
letes; however. this was never the
reality. Anyone who has ever met
Coach Pfitsch knows that his influe
ence has a scope and range fat be-
yond any athletic field. He has cap—
tivated generations with his stories
(the Coe story, Harry Tmman, how
he coached basketball in Ecuador
knowing only the most basic Span-

‘ish, hola, ojo. and various hand ges»

lures, etc etc...) that could and often
did last for hours. He embraced so

' many with his fatherly ways. He has

Welcomed so many Grinnellians into
his heart and his home and made
them feel secure even when home
might be thousands of miles away.
Coach Pfltsch is the greatest per
son I have ever met. there is not so
much as a close second. For those
of you who have never met Coach I
am sorry for your loss; however, I
assure you that Coach is always will-
ing to talk if you have the time to
listen. For those of us who have had
the privilege ofhaving him as an in-

To the-campus community:

We Sincerely apologize for throw-
ing water balloons at ﬁrst year stu-
dents during registration. Although
we were not responsible for all the
balloons thrown that day, we regret
panicipaling in such a sophomorlc
exploit.

We also would like to make eit-
pllcit the effects of water balloons
and the administration’s water bale
loon policy to anyone considering
likewise interrupting registration
next year. Like many students. we
had thought that throwing water bale
loons would be interpreted as one of
the many good natured antics that
occur during new student days. This,
however, is not the case. Students
and professors alike do not apprecr
ate having to contend with wet
clothes and hot tempers during the
already hectic registration process.
Additionally, water balloons, no
matter how safe they may appear,
pose a physical threat to students.
