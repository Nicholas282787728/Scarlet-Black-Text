A plea to fans

By Doug I-lodum

You may rememberthe article I
wrote last year concerning the ob»
noxious behavior of the Grinnell
basketball fans. Once again, I am
making a plea to stop this ridicu-
lous behavior for the sake of self-
respect. Last Thursday, the
women‘s basketball team travelled
to Iowa Wesleyan. However, they
had to deal with more than just the
opposing team as the fans were
rude. loud and obnoxious. Exe
tremely erudeand sexistcommcnls
were made to our players. Grinnell
won the game, but a few of lhe
players 1ch the court somewhat
shaken after the ordeal.

I know that the Grinnell fans are
not nearly as poorly behaved as
these Iowa Wesleyan fans, but the
factremains that they can getoutof
hand. Granted, it is not all of the
supporters that get obnoxious, but
those thatdoreflectpoorly onthose
who root for our team in a well
behaved manner. I was surprised
by lheamountofpositivenoise that
was generated as the women beat
Illinois College. Chants of “dee
fense“ undoubtedly made it diffi-
cult for the opponents to operate
theiroffense. However. thissupport
was marred by a few ridiculous
comments about players and the
referees.

On the eve of the Illinois Col»
lege game, I overheard a conver-
sation between a few of the known
loud fans. They believed the fans
should concentrate on supporting
their team, rather than hackle the
referees and opponents. This was a
surprise, and while the noise cre-
ated at the game was more positive
than usual, there were still negative
comments made, Could we please
just try to control ourselves as we
host Midwest Conference finals?

Let us utilize the confines of
Darby Gymnasium to support our
team with positive fan noise. rather
than attempt to degrade the oppo
nents orthereferees.Afterall,what
purpose does the heckling fulﬁll?

Lawrence beat Grinnell to win

that when the Pioneers come to
town you better watch out. They
are a force to be reckoned with in
the Midwest Conference. Grinnell
loses three standout seniors to

retain solid veterans like Jacobsen

youngsters like Mussatt. Young.
