Enloe analyzes women in military

By J. Otto Pohl

Critical feminist questions should
be asked about all events, including
the Persian Gulf War, arguedCynthia
Enloe last Thursday‘in her convoca-
tion speech entitled “WhatHave you
Done with your Yellow Ribbon:
Women in the Post Gulf War Era.“ A
specialiston the inﬂuenceof ethnicity
and gender upon the military and the
author of eight books, Enloe devoted
her convocation to posing questions
aboutthe role of genderin thePersian
Gulf War,Sheexplained thatalthough
afeministinterpretation does notpro-
vide a complete explanation of the
GulfWar, it does provide insights not
available by other means of inquiry.

Enloe explored several aspects of
the Gulf War from the perspective of
gender relationships. First. she dealt
with the effect of the Iraqi military
occupation upon women in Kuwait
By examining the Iraqi army's treat-
mentof women in Kuwait, she said, a
lot can be learned about the Iraqi
army, She remarked that “Iraqi sol-

diets learned to be soldiers by learn-
ing what it is to be manly,“ This
inquiry further reveals the Iraqi
military‘s policim towards rape. The
type of women subjected to sexual
assaultin Kuwaitalsoilluminated the
class and racial hierarchies existing
in Kuwait. Those women with least
status in society were the most likely
to be raped.

Next, she dealt with the role ofthe
Kuwaiti and Saudi suffrage move-
ments in the Gulf War. Because
“state systems are constructed out of
particular relations between men and
women," these movements had di-
rect bearing upon the struggle be-
tween royalists and Islamic fundar
mentalists over the future of the Gulf
monarchies, In Saudi Arabia, a driv-
ing protest by women was harshly
suppressed by King Fahd in order to
reclaim legitimacyin the faceofchal-
lenges by the fundamentalists The
King also prohibited the presence of
prostitution aroundUS bases. Saudi
Arabia is the only nation ever to ban
brothels for use by the American mili-

tary.

Enloe spoke about military prostir
tution to conclude her speech. While
SaudiArabia forbade prostitutionnear
U.S. bases, all other host countries
have allowed prostitution for U.S.
servicemen by treaty. As a result of
this policy "US. men are socialized
in the military to believe that they
would have easy access to sexual
services in host countries" In order to
maintain morale the Pentagon fruit-
iessly attempted to acquire rest and
recreation agreements in thesurround-
ing nations, Finally, the U.S. Paciﬁc
Fleet solved the problem by stopping
in Thailand, famous for its bordellos,
on the way back to Japan. The in
creasing percentage of women in Ihc
armed forces and thepolitical organi-
7ation of military wives has made the
cunentPcnIagon policy towards pros-
titution problematic.

woman may see feminism as an cir
ther/or situation 7 either she is a
raving feminist, balancing a high-
level position anda family, or she has
no place in the movement

“Rather than rcslricting the femi-
nist agenda to benefit only an elite
group of women. . ,we are finally be-
ginning to confront the racial, ethnic,
class differences among us," Chris-
tian declared.

Sheused hcrhome,theCaribbean,
to show howfeminism needs to cover
other socio—econom ic strata. “Women
there are really poor. For them, ac»
cess to water is the most important
issue," she said.

Christian held up Beloved as a_
novel which is concerned with these
differences.

“Within different women, then;
are different concerns far more com-
plex than the feminist discourse to!
day," she sighed, adding, "I hate [0
even use that word, half the women
out there don't even know what i?
means.” v

Beloved is a work which can be
interpreted on many levels. Itis about
“what a mother is...the powcr anti
venerability of the role" as well as
“the different class and racepositions
within society." ‘

An exciting speaker, Christian
definitely gavcher audienccplcnty to
think about. ’
