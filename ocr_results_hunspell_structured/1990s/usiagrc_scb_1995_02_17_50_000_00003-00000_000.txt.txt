ESPITE mild apprehension
on thcpartortlicscinvolvcd
in the planning and cxecue

tion or last year’s event, the annual
100 Days Party for seniors held sin.
urduy at State Street Station was a
success. The party allowed seniors to
celebrate the fact that there are just
100 days left before graduation.

About 180 seniors purchased
356 tickets to the party, and all
funds contributed to security,
sound equipment and refresh
ments for the evening. Drinking,
dancing and eating consumed
most of the night, and senior Jer-
emy Lipshutz noted that all the
beer helped partyegoers say, “I
think I had a good time."

Originally, four kegs were pur-
chased by the party’s planning come
mittee. Another was bought by party-
goers during the event, and State
Street Station owner Larry Bryan
donated a sixth keg later in the
evening.

The response of seniors attende
ing the party was overwhelmingly
positive. Derechstfall said simply,
“Gee, I hope we don’t run out of
beer.”

Alex Lydia was more philosophi-
cal.

“Grinnell,” Lydia said, “in all
my wild days my mad existence, you
keep your promise and I’ll keep my
distance."

Some seniors were surprised
by the number of those attending
whom they did not know. ”I don't

friends are either older or
younger. But I'm having fun."

Dispelled Saturday night was
the belief that everyone at
Grinncll knows everyone else.
“Reunions" were fairly common
throughout the evening. Robin
Cook said: “I had the awesomest
time. [I saw] people from my
tutorial and all that stuff."

This year, State Street Station
was the only place in Grinncll that
would agree to host the party. Plane
ning committee member Craig Gib-

ﬁnding a place to have the pany was

from upper respiratory infections with
symptoms like elevated temperatures,
head congestion, sore throats and
coughs.

American Legion, were not used be

State Street Station employee
Shannon Fitzgerald-Schultz, who
worked Saturday night, admitted
that the this year‘s party went “a
lot better than expected.”
Fitzgerald-Schultz said she was
impressed with the behavior of
those who attended.

Bryan said he had had no res-

influenza virus as the source of much
ofthc illness. However, Bailey added
that the blood tests necessary for a
definite diagnosis have notbeen done.

Bailey acknowledged that the
outbreak may have been caused by
several reasons.

“[Studcnts] all returned from dif
ferent areas oftlie country after winter
break," she explained, “[and they
brought] back different viruses that
[they] had been exposed to."

Due to close living quarters and
the general collcgc studentlifcstyle, in
which students often put academics
first at the expense of physical needs,
it is natural for illness to break out
sometime between November and
March, Bailey said.

But this year, the number of stu-
dents affected was particularly large.
Bailey noted that, had they had flu

I friend Pino over winter break.

Pino‘s house isjustafew blocks
from mine, and when the weather in
the Chicago area was decent, I could
walk to his house in ten minutes.
Pinn lives across the street from the
Goldmans. The Goldmans are still
grieving over the death of their son
Ronald. who was murdered in Los
Angelcs last year, allegedly by O. J,
Simpson,

It’s difficult not to feel sorry for
the Goldmans. Even though I never
knew Ronald Goldman, his story has
beentoldtomebyevery newsscurce
imaginable. The media interviewed
people who went to my high school
to determine just who was Ronald
Goldman. He has frequently been
called the “forgotten victim." This
title demonstrates exactly what is
wrong with the media today.

Anybody who wants to know
about Ronald Goldman's murder
need only to read a newspaper. If
you want to see the trial of his 30
cused murder, all you have to do is
flip through the channels ofdaytime
television. Information on Lhelife of
the man is available in any news or
pop culture magazine, There may be

Every day, people get murdered
in America, Innocent bystanders get
murdered in drivceby shootin gs. VIO-
lcnthusbands and boyfriends kill their
Wives and girlfriends. People get
shot for their shoes, watches, purses
and any number oflhings. These are
the true “forgotten victims."

Rarelywlllyou ﬁndinformaLion
in the media about these victims.
Court TV does not cover the trial of
their accused murder. Newsweek has
more imponant things to report than
another victim of a gang war. In-
stead, the media covers the 0. J.
Simpson trial extensively.

What real service is the media
providing to society by covering the
O. J. Simpson trial? Nothing. What
service could be provided by ex-
panded coverage of other murders?
It would draw attention to urban and
domesticviolcnce. Oncetheseissues

thing might be done about them.
America does not have a problem
with celebrities turning into murder-
ers. The media would do a great
service to the country by covering
real news.

problems,he said, because“somc

Overall, seniors who attended
had a great time. Many hoped the

“I was told some time ago that if
we could have three-fourths of the
[campus] community inoculated, we
could have a safe community," she

All in all, however,just 725 stue

“Handwashingis vcry important
for all of us who live in this environ-
ment. It soundssimple," she said. “but
it is a very good method ofcontrolling
eonmgious things."

The town of Gi'innell so far has
not been as severely affected as the
college. “There are some people [who
are] starting to get [the flu] ," said local
practitioner Dr. Dave Ferguson, “but
not as [many townspeople] asstudents
have it yet."

Grinnell Middle School nurse
Susan Gallo said the flu has spread a
little among middle school students,
but it hasn't reached the college's pro-
portions.

Lee Schelmtz of the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta stated in a
telephone interview that the nonheaste

strains of the ﬂu spread fairly quickly
