Corey addresses deﬁcit, abortion

By Steve Clem

_——__.—

iast Monday, Leroy Corey dis-
cussed conservative issues in South
lounge before a crowd of approxi-
mately 50 students. Mr. Corey, pub-
lisher of the American Conservative,
spoke on such topics as abortion. the
budget deﬁcit, abortion, and Ale
research.

Corey ﬁrst discussed the budget
deﬁcit, and what sort of programs
congressional appropriations were
being spent on. “Senator'l‘om Harkin
endorsed an appropriation of $62,000
to study homosexual mating habits of
seagulls," Corey said. Corey also
pointed to similar spending patterns,
including$25 million tobuy unwanted
coal for the Navy, $566 million to
move cows to Europe for a trade
show, and $50,000 to prove sheep»
dogs actually guard sheep,

While Corey blamed democratic
congressmenfortheincreasedspend-
ing, he believed that institutional
changes can fight deﬁcit spending.
He called for a line-item veto to be
available to the President to avoid
porkbarrels tackedon the end of bills.
Corey also believed a constitutional
mandate requiring a balanced bud-
get, with the exception of war time or
a national emergency, would allevi-
ate deﬁcit spending He suggested
that another constitutional mandate
should ﬁx the percentage of peoples’
total incomes that can be taxed by
Congress.

Whenaskedaboutabortion,Corey
said, “I would like to seeRoe v Wade
overturned becausel have never con-
doned killing unwantedbabies. There
aretwo bodies involved. if it was just
the woman, Iwould say do what you
want." Corey stressed that he does
not believe in federally-funded abor-
tion clinics, and at one point com-

pared the pro-choice mentality to
Adolph Hitler’s.

At one point, a member of the
audience pointed out that there have
been approximately 380 AIDS cases
reported in the state of Iowa, yet it is
the only state in the United States
without state funded research

Corey responded that he would
rather see money go to AIDS re-
search than read repair. Corey went

on to say,“Wealso havetoremember
that far more people die of cancer,
heart attacks, car accidents. and alco-
holism as well. if we start funding
diseases, 1 think I’d look at some
others before I’d look at that."

Corey also addressed the conftr»
mation hearings of Judge Clarence
Thomas, as well as the PC move-
ment. Corey's speech was sponsored
by the Campus Republicans
