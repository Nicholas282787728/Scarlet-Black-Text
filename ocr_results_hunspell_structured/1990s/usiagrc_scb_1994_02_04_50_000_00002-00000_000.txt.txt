WROVING food qual y, pro

ducing plants resistant to insects

and disease, and feeding the
world’s growing population: these
are the dreams and goals of the Inter
national Laboratory for Tropical
Agricultural Biotechnology at the
ScrippsResearch lnstitutein Lalolla,
California,andmorcspeciflcally,Co-
Director Roger Beachy. this week’s
convocation speaker.

Dr. Beachy, Head of the Divi-
sion of Plant Biology at Scripps, has
had a vast experience with genetic
engineering, but admits that he does
not have a green thumb. He has won
assorted awards and worked for vari-
ous institutions after receiving de-
grees from Goshen College and
Michigan State University.

Dr, Beachy’s work at the insti-
tute is primarily with the genetic
breeding of plants to resist viral dis
eases (hoping to improve crop yield
while keeping costs low), mainly
through the decreased use pesticides.
In addition to giving this weeks‘
Scholar’s convocation, Drt Bcachy
presented a biology seminar entitled
“Genetic Transformation of Plants

and Social Applications.”

His work is with genetic trans-
portinstead ofjust breeding specific
plants because of the benefits of spcv
cific trails, the shorteramountoftime
for results, and greater precision.
However, the overall benefit of his
work has been questioned. “IS this
research helpful or harmful?” Dr.
Beachy questioned. “I don‘t know.
butldon‘twantto be theone thatwill
be held accountable to my children if
it is indeed harmful." Much other
research is being done to observe the
other effects of his work.

So what is in the future of plant
genetics? Dr. Beaehy mentioned
projects for crops' increased resis-
tance to natural disasters and “cnvir
ronmental stress” like drought or
flood damage, which has been of
interesttoareafarmersinrecentyears.
Other researched improvements in-
clude crops‘ increased ability to pro-
duce in marginal soils; better overall
quality improvement; increased mer
dicinal values of crops, including the
possibility to one day get your yearly
flu shot in spinach: and an increase in
use of crops for renewable resources
such as plastics and oils.

Dr. Beachy hopes to spread the
new research throughout the world.
His co-workers at the institute, from
13 different countries, are encom-
aged to take the information that they
have learned home with them. Drt
Beachycommented thatmany people
felt that this technology should be
kept within the US. to control this
new market; however, he feels that

we have a “moral obligation" to the
rest of the world to share this work
with them. “We need to think less of
our local views of this subject,“ Dr.
Beachy encourages,“ and think of
our larger role in the world.”

good tobetrue? Itprobably is.

In the January 28 issue of the

The ad was accompanied with
an insertion ordcr straight from an

advertising agency. It is standar
procedure to run ads received thi
way, because advertising agenci

are reliable with their advcrtiscmen

telephone number) he “got a messag
saying the line was temporarily bein
serviced and would be functioning i
an hour."

After several calls with the Sam
message, Brooks called the Georgi
Telephone Service Department, wh
said the line was serviced in Jul,
1993. The insertion order was date
January 3,1994.
