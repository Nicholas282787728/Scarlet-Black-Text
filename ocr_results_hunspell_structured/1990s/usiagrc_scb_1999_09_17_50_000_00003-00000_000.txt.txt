Michael ondaaric’s novel has many
srrong poinrs going for it. First and
foremosr, ir does not insult the
reader wirh a blasé srory or
characrers You have to be an aerive
reader — you have re l/Jm/e in
order ro enioy rhis novel. In facr,
Ondaarie has consrrrrcred rhe srory
so we are never rold one sale in irs
enrrrery before we srarr anorhcr
one. The book unfolds irself in
layers, and it is up to rhe reader to
undersrand whar por-rion of rho
srory is currenrly unfoid‘lpg.‘ a,
The book is ser in an ,iralian'wiila
in she finalsragcs of rhe second
World War. There are four main

 

 

 

 

 

characrers in rhe book, and each has
a srory unfolding behind him or
her, There is rhe nurse, Hana. who
is caring for rhe parrenr because he
reminds her so srrongly ofsorneone
very close to her. The war has raken
many of her loved ones from her
and forced her emorions ro rerrear
wirhin licl, There is she rhier
Caravaggio who was physically
mauled as a direcr resulr ofrhe war,
He grew up wrrlr Hana before she
war, and gives us many insighrs inro
her pasr his and personaliry. There
is rhe sikh Kip, who diffuses bombs
for rlre Alllcd army. He joined rhe
army because his brorher refused ro.
He is a quier man wirh an
enormous responsibiliry on his
shoulders. And finally, chere is she
mysrerrous rirlc characrcr, Where
did he came from? Whar evenrs led
rip ro his fall from rhe sky in a
burning plane> Hrs srory is one of
love, bcttnyai, cxpiutation, and
friendship. Through his memories,
we rneer rho maioriry ofrhe book's
supporrrng characrcrs: Geoffrey
Clifron, his wife Karherine, Counr
Alinasy and his parrner Madox, and
rhe Royal Geographical sociery.
The book follows rhe lives and
rnrersecrions of rhese four main
characrcrs, slowly unfolding rheir
pasr rragedies and rriumphs.
ondaarie has a beauriful poeric
voice (just read some ofhis poerry),
and he uses rhar voice marvelously
in rhis insrance. However, it seems
as rimes char he armors his gifr for
poerry. There are many beauriful
lines rhar have no real purpose in
rhe book at rheir given place. These
lines, however, are few and far
bcrween. and do very lirrlc ro
diminish rhe arrisric qualiry of rhe
book.

I have anorher confession to make:
i had a very large bias in favor of
rhe book before 1 srarred reading it.
lcouldn’t conceive howireould lei
me down. Admirredly, rhis made
my expecrarions ofrhe bank rarher
high, but nor so high rhar rhey
could nor be reached. 50, do I
advise orhers ro read The Eng/rib
Parienzz Yes. I absolutely
recommend reading rhis novel, so
long as you are willing ro rhink
,abour Ondaatje's rale. To rhink
abour che srory Ifth: only way she
characrers and rheir srories will cver
live in your mind.

As parrofan clrorr to provide more
supporr ro snidenr playwr-ighrs on
campus, rlre Grinnell College'rlrcarre
Deparrmenr broughr professional
playwrighr lore Aspengren to do a
workshop called “Page ro Srage
lnrroducrion to Playwriring
Workshop“ for srudenrs on sanrrday,
seprember l l. in nddrrion, Brendan
Healy and Professor Pore-r Connolly
have otgnnlzcd Grinnell
Playwrighrs collscrive,

Aspcngrerr has rarrghr playwririrrg
ar rhe Univ siry of lowa and holds
her own residency annually ar Tower
Hill school in Delaware. Her play,
Flyer, will be performed in ocraber
by rhe sis Figures'l'hcarre Company
in New York, Audiences have
cxpcricnccd her work on Narional
Public Radio and in rhearres all over
rhe couniry. Her plays have h
published, and are being rransl'ired
for producrions in EuropeiArlicrmIiz
Smear/r, her mosr recenr play had a
reading in New York lasr spring,

As parr ofrlie workshop srudenrs
did rwo wrrring cxerciscs, warehed
parrs of plays rhar illusrrared an
elemenr of good playwriting, and
discussed business. Aspengren
discussed how nor to desrroy one's
work or oneself in she process of
wrinng, she assured srudenrs that, “if

(it:

 

n

you’re passionare abour it, rhere will
be an audience for it. There is some
rhearer someplace where your play
can find a home."

Grinnell College offers no course
in wriring plays. Healy describes rhis
absence as a “hole in rhe caralogue,"
To nil rhis hole, Healy and Connolly
have ereared rhe Grinnell Playwrighrs
collecrive,

The collecrrve will include
playwrighrs, acrors who will read rhe
plays, and people who would like so
lisren. ir will provide an opporruniry
for playwrighrs to ger inpur on rheir
workorsimplyhearliow irwill sound
on srage. “Playwriting is rhe leasr
likely ofall rhewnringarrs ro survive
in a vacuum. iris a crafr rhar is rneanr
to be heard, so a person who is
working on a play needs ro hear whar
rhey have been doing," said Hcaly,
who welcomes everyone so join.

“1r is a big srcp in rhe righr
dirccrion ro have srarred rhe eolleerive
and to bring Kare Aspcngtcn to
campus to work wirh srudenrs," said

Healy.

 

Professor Connolly empha ‘.es
rlrar parricipacing in rhe Colleerive is
helpful ro aerors because ir gives rhern
cxpcrlcncc workrngwirh new scriprs.

He also suggesrcd rhar someone

 

mighr wanr ro direcr original plays.
l-le encouraged srrrdrnrs ro bring
wlrarevei work rhcy have, including
renarunuie plays

Healy has been impressed by the
inrei-esr in playwrrring on campus.
Srndcnis from firsr.years ro seniors
have expressed interest in bringing
work to the COIiCCllVC Many of the
otudt‘nts involved I“! not Tiikilil'c
majors. “At rhe end of lasr year I
rerurncd from a sernesrer away ar rhe
National Tltcatcr Institute nnd
produced a stdgcducadingworkshop
()flinck nuw t)nL‘»ﬂcIS l lind written
The response from rhc whole campus
was phenomenal. We had more
people come rhan we had chairs for
and you could see people from all
deparunenrs across campus in rhc
audience. It was a sign io inc rhai
rlrere exists a srrong incercsr here ar
crrnnell in newwork being madeand
in being a parr, in one form or
anothct, in that new creation, It’s this
supporr rhar I hope will rransfer ro
rhe Playwrighrs Collecrive,” said
Healy.

While rhe College may offer a
playwriring class in rhe furure, for
now Connolly sees die Collecrivc as
a reminder that although, “in
Academic life rhere is a rendency so
think you need a class, a space. The
Playwrights Colicctivc is dedicated to
rhe idea rhar all you need is people
who cart," said Connolly.

The Collecrive mccrs every
Wednesday as 4:15 in she Thearre
seminar room on the second floor of

the Fin: Arts building.
