The driver stared at her, confused;
his cigarette fell out of his mouth

total and complete silence as he and
his passenger gazed at Amber.
“Ugh,” said the driver, “Sorry.“

simply famousAsifconservatism,
withits faithintheindividual,could
be anything but inimical to racism,
which judges blacks as a group and
not individually. As if there were
no black conservatives. Unbe-
knownst to Rose, many prominent
conservatives today are black, no-
tably Thomas Sowell, Waller Wil-
liams, Alan Keyes, and Douglas
Wilder. It is worthwhile to think of
the black writer and social critic
Shelby Steele. who in hisnew book
The Content of Our Character: A
New Vision of Race in America
remarks that “I believe there was
much that Reagan had to offer
blacks. His emphasis on tmditional
American values 'ndividual ini-
tiative, self-sufficiency, strong
families—offered what I think is
the most enduring solution to the
demoralization and poverty that
continue to widen the gap between
blacks and whites in America."
EchoingrecentrcmarksbyColin
Powell, Steele rejects affimtative
action on the grounds that it hurts
its supposed beneﬁciaries by erod-

ing their sense of achievement and
sets race. rather than ability, as the
main criterion for employers and
admissions committees—running
directly against Martin Luther
King‘s plea to be judged “by the
content of our character."

Rose‘s rationalization of
Farrakhzn‘s virulent racismg
manifest in his cxallation of Hitler
asa”greatman,”andhis derision of
Judaism as a “gutter religion"—
could just as easily apply to a white
demagogue like David Duke. I
could argue,though1wouldn’t, that
poor white Louisianans work long
hours in factories only to see their
earnings sucked up by the govemr
ment and redistributed through
welfare todysfunctional blackswho
use it in poker games and to buy
booze. The whites lose positions
for which they are qualified to
blacks advancing not by their mer-
its but through afﬁrmative action.
It’s no wonder that they turn to
Duke, whosc popularity is only a
measureoi'thcgmveinjusticcfaced
by whites in our minority-centric
society. This is about as credible as
Rose's vtcws on Farrakhan.

FEMINISM: How far does it eX—

"Seven years since Swarthmore:
If this is 'posl»feminism,' why are
WC soiweli, wistful?" by Jamie
Stichm ‘83:

My friend and I shared a rosy op-
timism about our prospects as
women in the real world.

"At that point, we were running
even with our male peers. We had
no problem competing with men

oars—and we saw no reason why
things shouldn’t stay the same.

"You see, we viewed ourselves
as part of the “post-feminist" gen-
eration. We thought the battles that
the suffragettes and women’s
libbers had fought were won. We

and deprivations we read about in

our public and private lives, with
brilliant careers, supportive husr

was the plan. anyway.

"So, face to face, women to
women, how did we feel tive years
after Swarthmore'! Not to sure of
all that. The more we entered into
society‘s arrangements it seemed,
the harder ll was to keep up in the
races we chose to run. Already we

between Home and Office. We

“I just remembered something.
Besides Bob DuPlessis, there was
only one man in that women’s his-
