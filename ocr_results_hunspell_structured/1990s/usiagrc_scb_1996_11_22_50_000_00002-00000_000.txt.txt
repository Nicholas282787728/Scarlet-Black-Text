STUDENTINITIATIVEi MORE COMPUTERS NEEDED IN BURLING LIBRARY

We the students or Grinnell College believe that s computers—with word—processing and vax capabilities—in Burling
Library for student use does not sufﬁmently meet the needs of students' needs. The library is the ideal place to study espe-
cially when writing and processing research using hard copy literature. it is inefficient and annoying to check out excessive
numbers ofbooks when only sections of them actually pertain to the research paper topic Moreover, the amount of Xeroxing,
especially periodical literature. could be decreased if students could enter the data needed from the article directly on a
computer and in the reportfsi being written Finally. encouraging students to use texts while in the library (reading. process
ing, and writing the report with them) gives other students access to these materials which may not have been feasible given
the current check-out and recall poliCIes ofthe Grinnell College Library and related research habits by the students.

STUDENT INITIATIVE— PROPOSAL FOR A GRINNELL EXPERIMENTAL COLLEGE

To better realize the ideals of self—govemance, leadership, and community, we the students of Grinnell College hereby
propose that an experimental college be established on the Grinnell campus. As detailed below, this experimental college
would allow students. faculty, and community members to organize and instnict courses which might otherwise not be
offered. The diverstty of Grinnell's student body reﬂects a wide range of experiences, skills, and knowledge which such a
program can utilize to its fullest potential. This transitional sesquicentcnnial year is the perfect time for the formation of an
experimental college. proving once again Grinnell's dedication to the changing face of education of public service,

PURPOSE

The establishment of an experimental college will hopefully accomplish five goals:

-lt wtll expand the overall educational opportunities available to students,

-lt will recognize pursUIts and interests outsrdc the sphere of traditional academics as an important part of a liberal arts
education.

-It will allow the college curriculum to reflect the ever changing interests and needs of the student body.

'It will facilitate campus dialogue and student interaction,

-Finally, an experimental college wtll strengthen ties between the college and the town of Grinnell by offering community
members the chance to both enroll in and teach courses themselves.

ORGANIZATION

The Grinnell Experimental College will model itself after the successful program in place at Oberlin College since 1968.
The experimental college will operate as a separate entity from the formal college and will not be linked with any current
department or division of the curriculum. Ajoint committee of students and faculty will oversee the selection ofcourscs, the
distribution of credit, and the disbursement of a small supplies budget, Anyone wishing to offer a course will apply during the
previous semester and be subjected to a strict evaluation and interview process. Applicants must provide the committee with
both a course syllabus and, if necessary, a materials budget. Depending upon the content and demands ofthe course, the
committee can then assign up to two Credits for both students and instructors. Courses must meet {or at least 12 hours
throughout the semester. Upon completion of the course. student and teacher evaluations will provide a basis for the awarding
of credit and to determine the teacher‘s potential for teaching future courses. Enrollment will be handled during registration
and students will be limited to two credits per semester, with a total of live credits throughout their college career, Experimen~
tal college credits will only count toward the total number of credits needed for graduation.

STUDENT INITIATIVE— MULTICULTURAL SPACE

We, the students of Grinnell College, find that there is a need for multicultural space on this campus. Multicultural space
is necessary for the following reasons:

"Multicultural space will provide a comfort zone for students whose needs are not fully met elsewhere on_ campus.

Multicultural space will provide meeting space for multicultural organizations which currently lack adequate space in
which to meet,

Multicultural space will provide a permanent and accessible home for multicultural resource materials such as books.
periodicals. and newspapers from foreign countries

Multicultural space will provide organizational space for multicultural groups to systematize their files and will allow
them to establish a sense of group history and continuity.

Multicultural space will provide worship space for those groups whose needs are not met by the college's current facili-
ties.

Moreover. there is also a need for additional space for the following purposes:

Additional space will provide student organizations with more meeting spaces and organizational space in which the
College is currently deficient,

Additional space will provide a place for the ofﬁces of the Chaplain, Rabbi, and their secretary to be consolidated. All
three of these ofﬁces are currently In different buildings.

We would like the College and the Board omestees to commit themselves to a bullding project that will meet these needs
for space. such as a third floor on the Forum.

STUDENT INITIATIVEeLISTING LABS 0N TRANSCRIPTS

We, the students of Grinnell College, want to have laboratories listed on ofﬁcial college transcripts. Labs from ALL
divisions (Humanities, Social Sciences. and Natural Sciences) would be listed

We recognize the fact that upper-level classes without labs involve a great deal of reading and writing Due to their upper-
level status; it isassurried that alarge amount of work i - equired for these classes. However. it is not always assumed that
concurrent labs‘are' aiways icduired of’cenai'n classes, This is‘cspcciaily into for classes such as MUS 11:: Harmony, THE

" l 15: Introduction to Stagecraft, and 810 373: Mechanisms of Evolution

Laboratories provide students with the opportunity to learn skills impossible to develop solely in lecture. In no way do we

expect to receive extra credit for lab; we simply want to ensure recognition of the additional learned skills.

STUDENT INITIATIVEi EXPANDING BURLING LIBRARY HOURS

We. the students of Grinnell College, propose that the Sunday Burling Library hours be extended to open earlier than the
current time of 12:30pm. The proposed time is 9:00am, this proposed time is open for negotiation; we only request that the
hours be substantially extended ~ ‘

STUDENT INITIATIVE— MENTAL HEALTH

We, the students of Grinnell College, decry the lack of mental health services geared toward college students undergoing
the stresses placed upon us, Although helpful to some, the professionals at the Grinnell Mental Health Center are not capable
of meeting the full needs of Grinnell College students. We feel that Grinnell College should hire at least one full-time
counselor who specializes in meeting the needs ofa diverse student population.

Reasons why GMHC is not able to meet the needs of Grinnell College students:

A. The counselors at the GMHC are not trained to deal with the speciﬁc problems and stresses associated with a competie
tive liberal arts college student body.

B. Many students feel intimidated traveling offrcampus in order to obtain mental health aid. -

C. RLC'S, who are trained in dealing with students. are currently over-committed as it is and are not readily available at all
times.

Industry. from page 1

Grinnell Products is participating in
the slate of Iowa’s Gold Card Pro-
gram. This is a Iiewjob and income
program which helps new industry
to develop and interact with Iowa
communities.

Grinnell's industrial park has also
seen activity in recent months. En-
gineered Plastics Components, pre—
viously located in Brooklyn, is now
expanding into the Grinnell Indus-
trial Park. With this new develop-
ment, the existing industrial park
will be filled by year's end.

Walker emphasizes that in addir
iion to the activities of new, large
companies, existing, smaller come
panics are also promoting growth
within the Grinnell industrial com-
munity. PAD recently completed a
survey of all companies in
Poweshiek County.

Columnist Rekha Basu
examines modern feminism

BY KATE KLEINWORTH ‘
Staff Writer

Columnist Rekha Basu, who
writes about political, social, and
women’s issues for The Des M'oines
Register, gave the Scholar’s Conv0r
cation and held a question and an-
swer session yesterday afternoon.

Her speech. entitled “Still Stuck,
Stiffed and stigmatized: Feminism's
Unfinished Business." contained
real-life stories of women‘s struggles
and a discussion of the myth of
equality and antifeminist backlash.

Basu, the daughter of United Na~
lions employees, was born in India
but raised internationally, giving her
a global perspective on many issues.

She has been writing columns for
The Register since 1994, working to
give voice to the underrepresented
and forgotten in society.

She credits her international up-
bringing with inﬂuencing her femi-
nist beliefs and‘career.

In her talk Basu described the sto-
ries of several women she had writ—
ten about in her columns. They
ranged from b red wives blamed
for being victims to single mothers

ignored by the system, from work
ers who took a stand against dis—
crimination to students who fought
back against sexual harassment.
Basu believes these stories, such as
the high school students who fought
their school's administration about
discrimination, show the importance
of political courage.

"It Shows that even if you're stu-
dents it doesn‘t mean you don‘t have
rights," Basu said, “If the adminis-
tration reads the rules to you or
throws the book at you, you can hold
them accountable for hypocrisy. It's
important for students to speak out
about being exploited, These Stu-
dents also had the support of boys.
It's also important not to count out
the“ support of males in this move
ment."

In her talk Basu brought up new
movements of antifeminist backlash
and the possible death of afﬁrmative
action.

Despite these events, she still
thinks that feminism will continue to
be an important force in the future.
She Said,“"l think the pendulum will
swingib‘ack once things get too ope
pressive.“

 

one or two jobs created by each
small company during the course of
a year may not seem like much, this
“behind the scenes job creation" is
“the engine that drives the economy
in rural areas."

Poets, from page 1

,After Mr. Lee finished, MS. Olds

said, “That was one of the greatest
readings I have ever heard.” Like Mr.
Lee, Ms. Olds also shared both pub-
lished and unpublished poems, She
also included serious and humorous
poems. The audience Seemed to thor-
oughly enjoy the ﬁnal program in the
Writers’ Series.

Grinnell Student Cory Turner said,
“Li-Young Lee read in a way that
truly showed his attachment to his
work, It seemed like he was sharing
something that was very maningful
to him." He also said, “Although
much of Ms. Olds’ poetry is very
serious and very contemplative, She
read some very light-hearted works.
Stylistically, the poets are diverse.
but they were both amazing. Tue
gether, it was really a great reading
7 and, above all, inspiring."

As the Writers’ Series came to a
close on Tuesday, both writers of-
fered words of advice to aspiring
writers. In an interview on Tuesday,
Mr, Lee said, “Work hard, and don’t
let anything get in between you and
your art."1n offering her own advice,
MS. Olds said, “Write and write and
write. Read, memorize the works of
others, and find encouragement in
your friends."
