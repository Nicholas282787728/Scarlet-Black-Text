Sharples & Mabon Review The J 0y Luck Club

By Riva Sharples
and Bill Mabon

’— RIVA'S VIEW’

F you like sad stories, The Joy
Luck Club is a movie that will

definitely make you cry.

The film has very little surface
plotand action, but rather is a colleca
tion of stories about four women
(June, Waverly, Lena, and Rose),
and their mothers, The movie cxr
plores the relationships between the
eight people. focusing on the con—
nection between immigrant Chinese
women and their Americanized
daughters

A story is provided for cacll

daughter and mother. The stories of
the mothers are the most interesting
because they deal with their lives in
China before coming to the United
States. The stories of their Amerir
canized daughters tend, in contrast,
to be superficial and slow.

Men are rarely seen in The Joy
Luck Club, and when they are men
tioned, it is almost always in a story
of abuse, betrayal, or sorrow.

Acting in The Joy Luck Club is
decent, but not outstanding. The
interactionofthcdaughters and their
mothers is awkward and seems unr
natural to the American viewer.

The movie is 20 minutes too
long (total viewing time 2:20), and
the laststory drags. Using subtitles,
vorcc-ovcrnarration,and ﬂashbacks,

This open space theatre produc-

been struggling with the death ofhis
best friend, and has refused to sleep
with his wife Maggie. Meanwhile,
his brotherGoober,wlio is poru—aycd

Maggie so desires.

In a larger sense, the play is
about the shattering of illusions and

how people are destroyed by social
conventions.

The cast of ten characters repre-

the cast as having a mixture ofabilir
ties, with a lot of new actors and
actresses and first-year students, as
well as those more experienced in
theatre.

Cat is the first play Gilbert has
directed at Grinnell, but not the first
play he has directed. His first expe—

HEjoyLiick Club chronicles

I the relations between four

ChinesevAmerican mothers

and their Americanrborn daughters,

which are tested by divisions in lan-
guage and culture.

This film is sure to be popular
with many Grinnellians solely be-
cause Ihc women come together after
fighting similar battles against opr
pressive men and societies. Based
on the Amy Tan novel by the same
name, the film‘s subject rnatterdoes

Poor acting and unlively direction
make it a two hourand twenty minute

exercise in trying to read your watch
in the dark.

Good niovics do not necessarily
need strong plots. The Joy Luck

rector Wayne Wang is successful at
presenting Illecharactcrs aschildren.
but as adults they lack vitality. The
mothers are suppored to be strong as
wellasscarred. yetlhe actors’ perfor-
mances are not convincing. Instead
the mothers have stern looks, intcrr
spersedwith momentsofforcedgrief
and rage. Thisgenertc formula is bad
enough when applied to one charac~
ter, but the tedium increases expo-
nentially as it is applied to all eight
women.

The Joy Luck Club presents a
shallow portrait of men, too. The

movie that dwells on human suffer-

“women’s movie but it is just a
“bad" movie.
