The Evil and Maniacal
Squirrels didn’t ger much
sleep on Saturday nighr.
They were too busy walk-
ing, camping and partici»
paring in Relay for Life, a
county-wide cvenr aimed
at raising funds for cancer
research.

The Squirrels, who
went by the acronym
TEAMS, was a group of
12 college students who
canvassed faculty, staff
and students to raise over
$500 toward the
Powcshcik event, held in
Aherns park last week.

The relay began at 7
pm. with a lap around the
park by cancer survivors.
Then for the next twelve
hours, members ofover 55

Two hours in, the Rev-
erend Bob Molsberry led
a ceremony ro honor those
who have heen stricken hy
cancen

“People purchased lu-
minaries in memory or a
victim of cancer, or in
honor of a survivor,"
Mary Nelson, who orga»
nizcd TEAMS, explained.
The candles, inscribed
with names and messages,
were rhcn placed along rhe
track as Rev. Molsberry
read the names of all the
people who had been hon»
orcd.

“I’ve had two grand-
parent die of cancer,"
Nelson said, “and the cete
emony made me realize
how lucky] am. It really
touched me. There were

people there who’d lost
parenrs, children.“

As the walking contin-
ued, some ofihe 400 vol»
untecrs sought shelter and
test in the tents set up by
each team. Others occu-
pied themselves with the
contests and entertain»
ment event organizers had
arranged.

Some ofthc relay reams
constructed theme camps,
and a rafﬂe was held early
in the evening.

As the night pro-
gressed, the Just Country
Dancers, Pookey Bleum
and the Dixieland Band,
rhe Tiger Paws and a bar-
bershop quartet all per
formed for the crowd.

said, “ro keep people
awake so you have
something to go on while
you’re walking at 4 am.”
When rhe Relay for
Life ended at 7 am. Sun-
day morning, Nelson had
slept for two hours, and
many other parricipanrs
had nor slept ar all. The
sacrifice ofa few hours of
sleep, however, was worrh
ir, recording to Nelson.
In rhe end, the relay
raised nearly $50,000 to-
ward cancer, more than

“The r .r rhar rhey gor
$50,000 peaks very well

Nelson ..iid. ”This is the
first sup towards doing

Emily Mize ‘01
doesn’t like eating at
Cowles. “If Quad is
closed, I mayjust skip the
meal. it isn’t that big a
deal. it’s not like a north
[campus]lsouth [cam-
pus] thing," she said. Sit-
ting with her in Quad, it
is clear that Mite acts on
her feelings, even when
those feelings are mild.

Last week, Grinnell
college saw whar hap-
pens when those feelings
are intense when Free the

Planet, (FTP) hosted the
EcoAction '99 confer»

once on campus.

The project' was
largely the brain child of
Mizc, who co-coordi-
natcd the organization
last‘year,

Over salad, pizza and
a bowl of chocolate ice
milk, Mize talks about her experiences
with FTP.

”It’s a really great group,” said Mize.
“And they’ve done some really amazing...
actions. People expect things like that
from college students in California and
Washington, where the environment is a
big issue, but not in Iowa." She said when
students organize and protest here, like
they did last semester as part ofRajnforest
Action Network's Day ofAction at Home
Depot in Des Moines, people notice.
“We’re not some wacky kids [at] Berke»
ley,” said Mize, “We’re in the heart land.
This is suppose to be family values.”

“Emily is an amazing, dedicated
worker,” said FTP co-foundet Bill Hole
land ‘00. “She’s a great leader, a great or—
ganizer, and knows how to get things
done."

“She knows how to give other people
responsibility,” said FTP member Matt
Ewing ‘02.

Vanessa Pierce ‘02, also a member of
FTP, agreed. “Emily rocks. she works
really hard but is also goofy... she reminds
me of Claire Danes from ‘My So-Called
Life.”

“A lotofpeople tell meI remind them
ofClaire Danes from theTV show,” said
Mize with a grin. As for her leadership
skills, she points to her years ofexperi-
ence in activist groups and other train-
ing she has had.

nI’m a lot better now than I was in
high school,“ said Mize. “In high school,

 

there is adrive to be the person ir, charge
and there weren’t too many [nth edi-
cared people. FTP helped \"i . n that
though... I went to Washington for an
FTP conference and that helped Tit learn
about designaung .esponsibilay‘.“

“I think a good organizer is someone
who organizes themselves," Mize.
“This is college, and there is gir turn-
over. We’re not going to be hers v
so if you want to keep groups a} we, you
have to make sure other poopw are
trained to be leaders... FTP has a great
structure. Usually, sophomores coordi-
nate it, and older students mentor them.
It’s not like one person becomes presi-
dent and stays there until they graduate,”
she said. :

In addition [0 workinglwiih' P,
Mize takes piano lessons and his penici—
pated in MockTrial for the last two years.
She’s taken a btmk from Mock' this
year so she can go abroad to Sp ti iiexr
semester.

Mize isn't sure what she'd like to do
after graduation." I‘m a bio m r with a
concentration in environmental studies.
I used to thing I’d become an env‘ron-
mental lawyer, but I think X may go into
the environmental movement. The prob»
[cm is, I want to make money too.”

Fortunately for M ize, she has a knack
ofmaking her desires into reality.

“We’ll see, ” she said. Claire Danes her-
selfcouldn’tbe more thoughtful.

This Friday, Chuck Warpchoski ‘Olwould like to see a lot of
srnderrrs eating in the town,

Every ouc or those srndcnrs will be helping rhe situation in
Easr Timor by participating in rhis semester’s Fog Fast.

RISE, a campus human-rights and social»justicc group, was
chosen to run the fall Fog Fast by SGA last week,

Warpchoskl, coecoordinaror for RISE, has a personal history
with East Timor that made him want to benefit this causc. “I
worked for the East Timor Action Group in D C. this SllmmL‘l‘.
or all the stories of amino that are raking place around rho
world, East Timor is rhe most egregious," he said,

The money raised by Fog Fasr will go to Timor Aid, an Ausc
[I'allanvlmscd organi7arion thatwrll be leading humanitarian relief
in East Timor

The rirning of Fog Fast on rlrc weekend ofthc dedication of
the Fine Arts ccntcr Will allow Dining Services to focus on CHIC!-
ing for rhose cvcnts. “It’s a wincwin situation." said Warpehoski.

824 students have signud up, according to Diane Hawkins,
office Coordinator oroining ServicosThar number is “none high"
compared to early years rhar have averaged around 600 snidenrs,
Hawkins said.

For each srudenr that gives up a meal, $1.80 wrll be given to
Timor Aid. That means this year’s Fog Fast should misc about
$1500,wc11ovcr RISE's goal of$1000 dollars,

in the past Fog Fasr has gone ro bcncfit Habit for Humanity,
AIDS of Iowa, and victims of Hurricanc Mitch, according to
Hawkins.

in addition to Fog Fast, RISE has organilcd several orhcr cvcnrr
to raise awareness ofthc situation in EasrTimor, “Things are looks
lug better [in EastTii-nor]," Warpcnoski said, “But in rhc Face of
