new political trend in which “very
many people just leave the [Com-
munist] pany." The local govem-
ment of Leningrad is composed of
independents and former Commu-
nists. On November 7, 1990 the
usual parade commemorating the
Revolution was augmented by a
“mounting meeting“ later in the
day.

The students agreed that a new
carefrceaunospherehadpermcaied
the cultural scene in Leningrad;
bands play in the streets, “non-
ideological" plays are produced,
formerly forbidden artworks are
exhibited. and “many amateur
groups have appeared."

Maria Mokhova stressed that it
is “not true" that the Soviet Union
has no vibrant cultural life. She
maintained that “despite so many
other problems...not everything is
Sobad."Shcsaidthatvariousgroups
“manage to keep these beautiful
places you see in postcards."

Mokhova and Marianna
Umudumova told the audience
some of the details of the religious
revival in Leningrad, one which
has been echoed tltroughout the

Soviet Union. One year ago there
were only ”23 or 24 practising
churches” along with one syna-
gogue and a Buddhist temple in
Leningrad. but now. “they are
doubled, ifnotmore.“The students
stressed that most churches were
packed full for every service.

The religious revival has not
beenwithoutcontroversy.however.
Many churches are plagued by a
lack of money. Anna Kushkova
said that “many people don‘t have
any idea What it’s all about," but
merely attend religious services as
a “fad or fashion." She was opti-
m istic about the newly formed Bibi
lical study group at the Herzen In-
stitute, however, and Said: “We are
not restricted in our activities.“

The audience had more ques
tions than time allowed for the stu
dents to answer. One area of inter
est was the students‘ education in
the Soviet Union. Dr. Arkhipov
stressed that the competition to
study at the Her-zen Institute, “a
college for teachers," is Very stiff.
He said that there are twenty candi-
dates for every student‘s position.

The students thought that the

Hanif Kurcishi's brave depic-
tion of an inter-racial homosexual
relationship in the film. which is
autobiographical in many respects,
allowed visibility tor the gay cola
ored community in England.
Nelson stressed that this breaking
of silence was “vital for its Sur-
vival" and that the very strength of
the film lay in its “inulli-focality."

we scream, the more likely that we
will be heard.

Whether or not we were “duped"
or believed his assertions is not the
point; BrothaZaahirhas iheright to
scream. As black people we also
“have a tradition of not being Slr
lenccd in the face ofhatred.” for we
know that “it is better to speak
remembering we were never meant
to survive."

Once again, we refuse to apolor
giro for the comments that our
Brotha made. He has enriched our
deficient understanding of OUR
