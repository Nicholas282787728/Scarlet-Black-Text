Climate Treaty Formally Adopted

The world’s first treaty to reduce greenhouse gases
emerged yesterday after marathon talks in Japan The
treaty mandates an average cut of5.2 percent in the emis»
sluns blamed by some scientists for a wanning of the
planet that could eventually prove to be environmentally
disastrous. U.S. Vice President/Al Gore, whose visitMon-
day helped restart the mired negotiations, said the treaty
marked a “vital turning point" in the global warming fight.
Many delegates to the UN conference on global warms
ing were also concerned the agreement did not go far
enough. “This is not good enough for the future," EU
Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjencgaard said. “We
would have liked the parties to be more ambitious." Presi-
dent Clinton welcomed the accord, which commits the
United States to cut emissions by seven percent from 1990
levels in the period from 2008 to 2012, the European
Union nations eight percent and Japan six percent from
I990 emission levels in the next 15 years.

British Government and IRA Hold Talks
Gerry Adams, the leader ofthe IRA's political wing, met
British Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday and said he
hoped this “good moment in history" would aid the search
for peace in Northern Ireland. Adams, the ﬁrst Irish Re~
publican leader to cross the threshold oftlie British prime
minister's ofﬁcial 10 Downing Street residence in 76
years, said the hourrlong meeting had been a good one.
However, Adams said he had bluntly told Blair that Brit—
ish rule of Northern Ireland had to end. Blair's spokes—
man described the talks with Adams as “constructive and
positive." Later, Blair said he had told Adams that Sinn
Fein’s presence in the current peace talks would end if
the ﬁvermonth cease—ﬁre was broken.

Heavy Casualties in Rwanda

terday at least 231 people were killed and an estimated

Hong Kong Schools Battle “Bird Flu”

Hong Kong schools warned students to shun animals in
pet zoos Thursday and braced‘for the prospect ofhaving
to destroy animals because of a mysterious “bird flu"
that has killed two people. Health officials say they are
racing against time to solve the mystery of the H5N1
strain of inﬂuenza, which normally is conﬁned only to
chickens. Several schools and kindergartens have re-
moved much-loved birds, and others are considering
whether to close their “feathered pet comers" on health
grounds.

Bob’s Underground increases in popularity as cigarettes and health foods are introduced

BY MICHAL DZIEGIELEWSKI
Contributing Writer

In what seems to be an overnight
change, Bob's Underground Coffeehouse
has become cool again. Alaethia Doctor
'00 attributes its renewed popularity to the
fact that ”Bob’s appeals to campus‘s
clearly deﬁned sense of boredom." Ree
lief can be found during celebrity bingo,
open mic night, poetry slams, card tour-
naments, art shows and quaint coffee-
house concerts. Iust this week, they've
started selling health foods and cigarettes
in addition to such Bob‘s staples as ba-
gels and espresso. The changes point to
a more signiﬁcant role now played by

Bob's in campus life, as well as a greater -

ability to offer a wide variety of services
for the student body.

Walking into Bob‘s Underground, one
cannot help but notice how things have
changed since those blustery winter nights
of past fall semesters, when the coffee-
house provided students with the closest
empty place to study. -

' In the spring of 1995, an award-win-
ning Titular Head ﬁlm’entitled “Rescue
411" parodied the relative safety enjoyed
on campus by satirizing what passes for
an ‘emergency’ situation in Grinnell. In
distress, actress and ex-Bob’s employee
Emily Bergl '97 had lost her key to Bob's,
and called 411 as a locked out crowd
banged on the door. The irony and big

Grinnell graduate Evan Wilcox is the
recipient ofthis year‘s Ninth Semester in
Art fellowship. For the last four months,
Evan had the opportunity to develop and
optimize his art style in preparation for
graduate studies in art.

“For most of the four years I was here,
I went from one extreme to the other,"
said Wilcox. “I would do one painting in
one style and think ‘that was pretty coolgt
I wo‘nder what it’ll be like if I do the op-
posite?‘ which is ﬁne, and taught me a
lot, but it didn't produce the kind of port-
folio I needed to get into grad school.
That's where ninth semester came in."

“When young artists apply to gradu-
ate school,“ said Art Professor Bobbie
McKibbin, “they are judged almost solely
on their portfolios. The schools generally
don’t look at GREs or GPAs and are look-
ing for a very focused body of work.

“In this liberal arts setting, students are
restricted in how many hours they spend
in art classes . , .The ninth semester al-
lows art majors more time to work.”

In addition to developing their artistic
styles, fellowship recipients also have the

there was never a crowd waiting to get
into Bob’s. '

Not anymore. Current managers Theo
Bott '99 and Nicholas Rains ‘00
considered closing Bob's on
Wednesdays last semester due to
lack of business. The new ferocity
With which the Pub enforces Iowa's
drinking laws, however, has turned
Bar Night into Coffee Night, mak
ing Wednesday ihe coffeehouse’s
busiest evening. Of course, Thurs-
day~night bingo, music on the
weekends, and nonsmoking Mon-
day all constantly keep the employ-
ees busy.

The addition of new services has
also increased crowds. Over the
weekend, it became clear that the
new service ofselling cigarettes has
increased total sales by 30%. This
increase hasn’t only been from the
cigaretteepurchasing smokers, but
also the Coffee'n bagelrpurchasing
friends of smokers. Bott dreams that
the new funding might make this pecue
liar student-run establishment proﬁtable
for only the second time ever in its his
tory. Bob‘s has used the new income for
the risky venture of providing health foods
from the Co-op in Iowa City, as well as a
planned wage increase of 15 cents for its
employees.

The managers of Bob’s intend to rein '

rent Grinnell students at all levels of the
art department, and are given a stipend to
live in Grinnell and pay for supplies.
Wilcox used his ninth semester to unify
his style, which can be described as
slightly abstract, but with personality.
“When I got here, I did lots of really
clean stuff; flat paint, geometric ﬁgures,
clean lines, that kind of stuff and doing
this messy, really textural work was kind
of the opposite. Towards the end of last
year, and a little bit this year, I've tried to
unify the two extremes, using texture and
uniform clean lines. Having four months
free to do that has been enormously pro~
ductive. Staying in the same style and
thinking the same thoughts for four
months has produced something that I
think is alotmore original tome that any
thing I have ever done before.
“Basically what rm trying to create,
and to some degree have been successful
in doing this semester, is work that is fairly
low key. It’s not harsh or polished. It lets
you see that someone sat down and
worked on this thing, but it doesn‘t try to
be bold and intimidating, It tries to be
approachable so that you can look at it
and recognize that this is something that

Habitat Registers for Recognition

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

The highly active Grinnell College
Habitat for Humanity group is in the pier
cess of registering with the national or
ganization to become an official chapter.

“I always assumed we were [regis-
tered], but while I was on the web grab-
bin g graphics for a poster earlier this year,
I found a list of colleges with Habitat
chapters and saw we weren‘t on it," said
Habitat for Humanity student coordina-
tor Erin Hustings ‘98.

According to Hustings, creating an of-
ficial campus chapter will give the cant-
pus group recognition and help facilitate
better operating methods for students in-
terested in participating in Habitat pro-
grams while here at Grinnell.

The introduction of: Habitat For HUr
manity afﬁliate to Poweshiek County in
fall of 1989 came to pass, largely, though
assistance from Grinnell College students
and staff. Especially involved in the pro
cess were Kevin Herrick ’90 and Kent
Joth '90 and then College Community
Service Coordinator, Heather Kenvin
Hietala. Since its creation, the affiliate
has taken up several projects within Grinr
nail and all have been assisted by college
students. The close relationship between
the Poweshiek County afﬁliate and it’s
Grinnell College volunteer corps have
made the two almost indistinguishable
from one another, but differences exist.

According to Habitat for Humanity

International, campus chapters have dif
ferent duties than community afﬁliates.
According to their charter, campus chapr
ters deal with providing volunteers, raise
ing money and education while the local
afﬁliate deals with legal issues, finances
and site selection. Students are allowed
to participate in either as their time per-
mits. ’

“Grinnell students played a central role
in starting and maintaining the affiliate,“
said Hietala in a letter regarding Grinnell
College‘s volunteer participation in
Poweshiek Country Habitat affairs. “They
served [and serve] as Habitat Board mem-
bers and officers, providing essential ad-
ministrative support-and they labored at
the work site"

Newly active Habitat volunteer Brian
Vicente ‘99 enjoys working on construc-
tion projects and feels the new chapter
status will bring more students like him
into the program.

“I think the new status will make us
more visible. So far, its allowed us to
move ahead and set goals for regular work
days, It has added energy to the group"

The immediate results ofthc Grinnell‘s
Habitat group are promising. The ﬁrst
phase ofthe application process has been
completed and Hustings expects that the
chapter will be up and operating by lite
and oflhe school year,

“Pcople have responded really well.
The process is moving along and I'm ope
timisttc, It'll be a positive step for this
campus," she said.

was spawned by last semester's manager,
Kevin Rich ‘97. With the heated quar-
reling between smokers and non~smok-
ers over smoking in the Forum, Rich
thought he had found a way to appease
both sides.

Kevin met with the leaders of GASPP
(Grinnellians Against Smoking in Pub-
lic Places), and they agreed that Bob’s
would be an ideal place for smokers, and
furthermore a little compromise would
lessen student resistance to the elimina-
tion of smoking in the Forum. Kevin
said, “Even the nonrsmokers recognized
that people have to have some place to
smoke.” Kevin made sure this new ser-
vice would be understood as not condon-
ing smoking, but simply as a necessity
for keeping Bob‘s open and thriving.
This semester, under the guidance of Bott
and Rains, Bob's gained the approval of
President Ferguson and obtained a li-
cense from City Hall to sell cigarettes.
The smokes are kept behind the counter
and when a pack is purchased, the cus-
tomer must enter his or her name into a
ledger in an effort to combat underage
smoking.

Cigarettes and health foods are but
tiny parts ofthe reconstruction ofBob's.

tion system, new glassware and a won-
derful new espresso machine, the em-
ployees and student managers have re-

that they‘re more about the

Those feelings, VVIlcox
said, are open to interpre-
tation.

“I occasionally get aggravated at a
show when someone comes up to me and
says ‘what is this supposed to say to me?
or what does this mean?‘...A lot of people
walk into an art show and don’t quite
realize that their personal interpretation
is a lot of what the artist is interested in,
which is the case with my work."

basement of Burling. A reception will
be held at 4: 1 5pm, to which students and
faculty are invited.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exploring Javanese Music

or RYAN OLSON
Staff Writer

One of Grinnell‘s most unique artistic
ventures is the Javanese Gamelan En-
semble. The group learns and practices
Javanese gamelall music, which origi-
nates in Bali and Java.

According to a community gamelan
ensemble in reSidence at
the Massachusetts Instir _
tute of Technology ‘

(MIT), “the word

gamelart means ‘to

hammer,’ but the term

refers to the large pore

cussion orchestras of

Java and Bali." The pri-

mary instruments “are

gongs, metallophones, and hand drums,
with cymbals, vocals, bamboo ﬂutes, and
spiked fiddlcs used as Well."

Music Professor Roger Vetter, has been
directing the ensemble at Grinnell since
1986. Vetter said that he has been “study
ing and performing Javanese music since
my student days in 1972."

Spending time in Java in 1973, 1975,
1982-1983, and 1989, Vetter has devoted
a considerable amount of time to study
ing and pert‘onning Javanese music. He
has also directed ensembles at the Uni-
vcrsily of Hawaii and the University of
Wisconstn-Madison.

Vetter states that “I obviously love do
ing what I do, otherwise I wouldn‘t put in
1012 hours a week teaching students in

dividually." He spends additional time
in “the three hours of group rehearsals
per week."

This music is a deﬁnite step away
from the western traditions to which
many Grinnellians are accustomed.

Adam Salzman ‘00. concerning his
place in the ensemble, said, “This has
been my first semester in the ensemble,

and it has also been my ﬁrst experience
performing non-Western music. It’s been
quite a ride."

Speaking ofthe differences in not only
the sounds produced by the individual
instniments, but additionally the way that
they sound together in the ensemble,
Salzman went on to mention that
“Gamelan performance involves a whole
different sort of intensity than, say,jazz,
which is all about the lead instrumentex-
pressing itself against a solid musical
backdrop." He explained that “in
gamelan there are a variety of intercon-
nected ‘leadsf which often sound quite
dissonant and can be hard for the west-
ern ear to differentiate from one another."
