Multicspott arhleres are nor a new,

school arhleres play a sporr in every

However, when arhlcres move inro
rhe rcalm ofcollege and professional
sports, parriciparion in several sporrs
in one season decreases as rhe demands
placed on rhem by onesporr increases

One of rho ﬁrsr rhings all rhe in.
rerviewed multl-sport arhleres said was
how much rhey enjoyed playing iwo

“(Playing rhree sporis is) mosr

said. Walrers is a rncmher of rhe soc-

Brad lziihorr'Ol, who has played

ence It's really near in see how you
can conrrihiirr ro rhose reams," Rich-

ard Werner ’99 said. Werner has played
foorhall, baskerhall and ran rraek in
past seasons, though he gave up has-
kerhall aﬁcr his sophomore year.

For Ruhoff, rhc highlighrs ofplay-
ing on rhree reams are rhe camarade—
no and erhic he gains on all rhree.

i like playing ream sporrs and
working wirh rhc reams. I love gerring
ro know people," he said. “Also, rhey

Walrers said rhe hesr parr ofplay»

“Everything rhar you would ger

Cranred, rhai means rhe pain. Butyou

ir helps me manage my time. 1 love
ir," walrers said.

And she downs

But not every aspecr ahour play-
ing several sporrs in one year is posi-
rivc for crinnell arhleres. Practice ev.
ery day for rwo or rhrec seasons and
games or meers every weekend mean
pioneers who choose he mulrisporr
arhleres are forced to give up ccrrain
luxuries.

Ruhoff knows just whar he loses
as a mulriesporr athlctc: “Sleep. I don'r
get no sleep much before 2 o’clock (in
rhe morning) and l have 8 o'clock
classes Monday, Wednesday and Fri-
day,” Puhoffsaid.

Free rime also suffers as arhleres
ﬁnd rhemselves ar pracrice or games
for a good porrion of rhe year.

"somerimes you may wanr a week
end free every once and a while. But
during rhe week.,.l would he work-
ing out anyway, and (always playing a

directed. But when you’re parr ofa
ream you know when you're doing isn'r‘

. poi for you, hur it's for ihe good of

rho ream, too," Wemer said.

Although multl»spatt arhleres rake
a cur in rheir free time, rhey say char
rheir relaaarion and srress levelsdo nor
suffer. several nosed rhar playing rwo
or rhree sporis actually helped rhem
relax. '

“I clljoy eompering so much—
iliar's one of rho reasons i play rhree
sporrs. l gei bored here ifl’rn iusr sit»
ring idle. So it’s almosr relaxing for me
re play sports rarher rhan sir around

Moroianr agreed “Practice is kind

ing all kinds of sporis, so I'm always

Hirring iheir srride

Moving around is whar multi-
spoii arlrleres ﬁnd rhemselvcs doing
more ihan almosr anyrhing else dut»
ing rhe year. However, rhc kinds mov.

ing they do from sport to sport differ
grearly (a harier uses very few ofrlie
same muscles 25 a tunnct does). This
can make adjusting from sport as sport
a problem.

“Physically, (adjusting is) ex-
rrcmcly hard. 1 can he in tip-top shape
for basketball but not be prcpated to
go and run a 200, It takes completely
different muscles," Walters said.

Mental strain can also hinder an
arhlere’s adjusrmenr from one sporr re
the next, especially ifthcse sports oc»
cur hack to back. Going from a team
that btcczcs through its games to one
that has to sttugglcjust to field a team

so we were winning all she rime.Then
playing on rhc haskcrhali ream and not
being able to win a single game was
kind ofhntd," she said.

Just as the differences between two
sports played by athletes can hinder
theitadjustmcnt to theirsecondsporr,
the shared features of the sports can
give rhem an edge going inro rheir sec—
0nd season.

“There at: components of sports
rhar overlap," Werner said, “Training
for track gives you an advantage on
the football ﬁclde Likewise, I think the
comperirive aspect of foorhall hrings
something to the track (cam—kind of
like a go ger :em mcnralrey.”

Playing favorires

Adjusting from one sporr re the
next can he dilficult for two-or three-
spott athletes. But the hardest part for
them by fat is choosing a favorite sport
ofrhe several rhey play,

Some Pioneers, like Ruhoff and
Walters, could nor pick a favorite.

“1 love ’em each for different
rhings. I can’r picka favotltc.1flcou|di
I rhink I’d only play rhar one sporr,"
Ruhoffsaid.

“Whatcvcrseason1’min,that's my
favorite sport,” Walters said, “Just don’t
ask me in bctwccn seasons. Then I'll
he really confused "

Others, like \X/cmct, could only
choose one sport as their favorite with
diiﬁculry, makingsurc they had plenry
ofevidence ro supporr their choice.

“I've always loved football. You’rc
giving up your body a lot more. I think
rhar’s why you have ro love it rh'ar
much more: you're going in and you’re
jusr sacriﬁcing yourself," Wenicr said.
