the enrollment and success of stu-

studies on student retention are pre-
liminary. and other academic depart-
ments will be considered, “We need
to know a lot more about what we‘ Ve
done and what does and does not
succeed," Duke said. “We need to
identify what works other places.”
Eric Wynn, Director of
Multicultural Affairs, described the
current student retention programs
that are more directed toward the in-
dividual strident, such as the faculty
mentoring program and peer
assistanceships. Wynn emphasized
the importance of the faculty
mentoring program, in which inter-

lecta faculty member to discuss both
academic and social issues and to
develop a more personal relationship
outside the classroom. However,
Wynn said. the program needs to ex»
pand to involve more faculty mem»
bers and ether students of color, “We
need to ask respective groups what
they need, because notall studcns of
color believe they need mentors. We
can‘t make assumptions about any-
body,” he said.

Wynn also mentioned the need for
an outside consultant to evaluate the
college’s multicultural environment;
this suggestion was an outgrowth of
the PCSMP, as well as the expansion
of the faculty mentoring and peer
assistant programs. “My role as a
counselor has also increased. The
OfﬁceofMulu'culturalAffairsisnow
less programmatic and more devoted
to counseling both white and
multicultural students,” Wynn said.
“it is important that the college’s fo-
cus on multiculturalism should be
redeﬁnedrobemore inclusive of other
groups, such as the Jewish students
and gays, lesbians and bisexuals," he
added.

Many students of color agree that
the conceptual focus of multi~
cuituralism should be broadened be»
yond consideration of just African
American issues. According toElena
Bemal. member of the MultivErhnic
Coalition , the college needs to extend
its student support services to stu»
dents of all ethnicities, perhaps pro»

person cannot do it 311‘ The Ofﬁce of
Multicultural Affairs needs to be ex-
panded to directly address the needs

of each group."Bemal said. She added
that the PCSMP meeting addressed
many concerns of the Multi-Ethnic
Coalition, especially with regards to
college support services for students
of color and the recent racial contro-
versies. “It‘s good that the PCSMP
met at this time. There’s a deﬁnite
sense that the committee is expand-
ing its focus to address issues for all
students of Color," Bemal said,

Landsberg said. A second pointofthe
petition was to show thatthc acts will

the student body as a whole will not
tolerate expressions of anti»

“I would like to stress that it is
important for anyone to talk to us at
Student Affairs if they are being ha-

VACATION: Employee policy questioned

"We‘reall collegeemployces. It‘s
discrimination,”saidaphysicalplant
employee, who was concemed that
she remain anonymous. citing the in-
timidation she believesothcremploy—
ees received when they tried to con»
front their supervisors in the past,

“A lorof people areafraid to speak
up because of the possible repercus-
sions,“ said the physical plant em~
ployce. People whowentpublic with
their concerns over adifferent issue a
few years ago were punished, she
said,”1‘hey’vepaidforitI’mscared."

However, this employee believes
it is importantforherto speak outand
make people aware of what she sees
as a double standard. “Even though
we are under a union contract, every

thing we get, they get. Every day we
get off, they get off,“ she said.

“We were originally told ‘yes,’
that we had the day off," said this

was told that she would have to work
on the 23rd. After negotiations wrth
her supervisor, she was granted the
day off without pay." said the em-
ployee who talked to the Scarlet and
Black. "They told us we could use a
day of our vacation, but they’re not
making administrators and staffhave
to use their vacation time," she said

“No one here told them that they
would get the day off," said Walker,
stating that they negotiated to get a
fixed number of days off during the
winter holidays, including the day

“four ﬂoating holidays coordinated
wilh the Christmas holiday." Physi»
calplantemployees cannotuseoneof
their holidays for the 23rd. because
the employee could not make up the
day by working between Christmas
and New Year’s Day, as the college
would not be open.

“We have to go by the contract
negotiation. The union contract is the
union contract. They abide by it; we
abide by it,” Walker said. Walker,
who plans to come into work on the
23rd even though his supervisor sta-
tus would grant him the day off, also
believes that neither he nor Ferguson
can change the contract provisions.
"Once the contract is set» You don't
take special steps to skin the con-
tract,“ he said.

Walker said the contract is not up
forre»negotiation untillune30,1993.
Until then, “no changes can be made
in the contract” unless both the col-
lege and workers agree to renegoti-
ate sooner, said Walker, who added,
“TheIikelihooditwouldoccuris very
slim,”

Physical plant employees hope that
Ferguson may be able to help them
out, even though they say they were
told by their supervisors that it was .
Ferguson who denied theworkers the
day off.

“They [physical plant supervisors]
said they went to Pam Ferguson. We
don't think so. We don’t think she'd
do that...I can't believe she would
just put a blanket over everyone ex-
ceptphysicarl plant employees,” said
the anonymous employee.

When contacted yesterday,
Ferguson said she was not aware of
the issue until a few hours before,
when Walker called her after he had
been contacted by the Scarlet and
Black to comment on the workers‘
concerns, She had not been told that
the physical plant workers did not
have Dec. 23 off. However, she said
that as “all relations with the physical
plant are controlled by union con-
tract." she was not free to make any
changes in its provisions.

“It sounds like this is something I
do not havejurisdiction over. A con-
tract is a contract: both sides are
bound," she said.

Furthermore, Ferguson said she
could not give her opinion on the
