A student ofGale

Noyce, who died at the age of 62
nine years ago, was a Grinnell College
graduate andaprote'ge' ofthelate phys-
ics professor Grant 0. Gale.

Time credits Noyce, the co»founder
ofgiant Intel Corporation, withbeing a
Visionary who recognized that transis-
tors would lnake the vacuum tube obs
solcte.

“Fromthedayhcﬁrsthandledonein
college in 1948, Robert Noyce knew
the new gadgetrneant tllc endofbalky,
bulkyvacuumtubes,"FredericGolden
writes in Time. “But he also realized
you couldn’t do much with transistors

astonishment, the gifted young man

son —- achieved that goal in a decade.

not only helped rename an orchard~
ﬁlled Califomia valley but alsoled to a
seemingly endless harvest of silicon
devices, from PCs to coffcemakers.

‘The traitorous eight‘

But Noyce quickly dospaired of

“At Fairchild, Noyce used a new
chcmical etching method not only to
print transistors on silicon wafers but
also to lay down tracks between them.
Besidescliminatingexpensivewiring,
the new integrated circuits operated
much faster, Six months earlier Texas
lnstruments' Jack Kilby had produced
a similar chip, but it was made of
germanium, required external wires
and was tougher to manufacture.
Noyce’s chip won the ensuing patent
race, but the two friendly rivals were
content to regard themselves as can
inventors.

“In 1968 Noyce joined with fellow
Shockley ‘traitor' Gordon Moore to
found Intel. Under Noyce’s shirt-
sleeves leadership, it soon produced a
landmark mcmory chip and the so-
called computeronachip, or micro
processor. By 1974 Intel was so suce
cessful that Noyce traded day-today
managementofindustrywideconcems,
like leading a consortium called
Sematech to stave offforeign compe-
tition. He did in 1990 at 62.“

Another cover planned

Time plans one final cover on “the
heroes and icons who shaped our cen—
tury," and the magazine then will
choose a ”Person ofthe Century."

in an introduction to the March 29
edition, Walter Isaacson, Time’s man-
aging editor, notes that while there are
pitfalls to personalizing history, there
are advantages as well.

“By choosing the people we feel
were most responsible for key break-
throughs, and then exploring their re»
lations and rivalries, we hope to con-
vey the human exaltement that makes
real the progress of science," he de-
clares.

Also mentioned in the March 29
cover story is Iowan Norman Borlaug,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1970 for his biotechnology that led to
the so-callcd Green Revolution in crop
production.

 

Healthy community —

searchers have workedto establish two
models. one for the large metropolitan
areasofChicagoandMunich,theother
for Grinnell and Bolzano.

Not all the parameters of the in-
ternational effort involving Grinnell
have been established. For example,
it’s notyetelearhowmanypcople will
take part in the study, whether patients
will actually be recruited or simply
volunteer, how long the study will last
and howmuchem‘husiasmcanbegene
erated at the local level.

But both doctors are optimistic.

Schmidt-Neuhaus said he met with
Grinnell physicians Monday to dis-
cuss tlie program.

‘Very promising’ response

“The response was very, very prom-
ising," he said. “1 had the fear that we
might have‘to ﬁght to get their Coops

cration, but 1 found some very open-
minded physicians who said, ‘That's
the way we have to go, because it will
give us new perspectives to do our
work.‘ They are very open to using
new methods of creating a different
kind of doctor-patient relationship
which is based more on building up
health."

Alternatives such as massage
therapy, acupuncture and herbal
supplements won’t be ignored as part
ofthe overall approach to community
health.

On the grand scale. the project aims
not only to cut health costs but to have
major effects on society as a whole. If
itall works, it canmeanmajorgainsin
productivity and help reduce negative
societal factors such as violence,crime
and drugs, Nordinc and Schmidt»
Neuhaus are convinced.

“Health in this anticipatory strategy
really can change things," Schmidt-
Neuhaus declared. “The gains in this
ﬁeld, ifsuccessful, arejust huge."

way, He suggested that NATO‘s in
Yugoslavia doesn’t meet those re»
quirements.

In his press interview. the senator
saidthe US. has upwards of500.000
fewer people in uniform than it did
in 1991 during the Persian GulfWar.

Grassley also touched on the sub-
jects of the worsening farm econr
omy and health care during his pub
lic meeting.

In response to a questioner who
wondered whether Congress would
step in to change the course of the
Freedom to Fan-n Act, Grassley said
he doubts that will happen.

Seven-year program in place
“I think the answer is no before

2002, because we have a seven—year -

program that was put in place in
1996," Grassley said, ”By a wide
margin, Congressdecidcdthatsome.
thing we'd been doing for 60 years
wasn’t working and we needed to
ﬁnd something new. 1'm not sure
we’re entirely satisfied that the
‘something new‘ is going to be ad
equate. but 1 don‘t think Congress is
going to stop in the middle of a
program [and enact] something that
changes direction completely.“
Theremay,however,besomemore

money and land put into the Conser-
vation Reserve Program, but not as
an annual set»aside, he said. But the
empliasiswill continue to be on farm
production for the export market.

“It looks to me like we’re going to
have at least one more year of low
prices — some people would say
two. We do not see very good
grain or livestock prices for the next
year.”

Medicare changes

In response to a question asked by
Todd Linden, president of Grinnell
Regional Medical Center, Grassley
said that there is a bipartisan plan to
introduce legislation containing
“most of the recommendations" ap~
proved by a majority on the commis»
sion formed to address Medicare.

He noted that rules required a “sun

 

per-super-consensus" in orderforthe

commission to come up with a plan,
and that the panel failed to do so.
Grasslcy blamed six members ap-
pointed by President Clinton for that
failure.

, 'But that won‘t stop many of the

recommendations from being intro»
duced to the Senate Finance Com-

,mittee and eventually being crafted
.into legislation that will be reported

to the floor, he added,

“I think we will have a good piece
of legislation based on the
commission’s work,” he said.
