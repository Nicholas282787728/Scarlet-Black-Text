Minor cigarette enforcement

leads to cut in state funds

By Shannon Hill
(U-WIRE) Ames, lowa

Too many minors buy
cigarerres in Iowa, and as a
consequence, organizations
designed to help rehabilirare
young people with addictions
may have less money ro do ir.

The US. Deparrmenr or
Health and Human Services is
enforcing a reraileecompli.
ance goal, which punishes
states whose stores allow 25
percent ofminors to purchase
cigarerres illegally, said Scare
Scn. Johnie Hammond.

$5 million in federal funds
ing will bewithheld from Iowa
rhis year because iowa's non.
compliance rare is as percent.

“We're iusr nor doing well,
and I rhink a lor orpeople are
nor raking tccn cobacco rise as
seriously as they should,"
Hammond said.

Because ofthe stares high
rate, Youth and Shelter Ser-
vices faces a 40 percent our in
funding.

As a non-proﬁt organiza.
tion, YSS receives almost half
of irs funding from rhe U.s
governmenr, said Bob
Kersieck, head of Chemical
Dependency Services at vss.
Thar money is drsrribured by
rho srare in block granrs
rlirough rhe iowa Deparrmenr
of Public Health and the De

parrmenr orHuman services,

George Belitsos, execurive
direcror orvss, said the cur
will resulr in a loss or
$250,000 for sub.
srance abuse programs
in Amos and story
Counry.

Kersiecksaid many
kids will nor have rhc
opporruniry now to
beneﬁtftomtehahilita-
rion programs at vss.

“We served aboutéOOstu-
dcntswlth diat/lOpcrccnr," he
said. “About 160 otihem will
nor be able ro access rrearmenr
at all.”

Hammond said rhe pen.
alty is in response ro lasr year's
raiiure ro comply, and rhe srare
will face rhe same consequence
nexr year because rho ciirrenr
year's compliance rare already
is poor.

“Anothet$5 million oiirot
next year really would be dev.
asraring,” Hammond said.
“This is a rime we really need
to be working hard ro achieve
compliance."

The srare has filed an ap.
peal ro reverse rhe funding cur,
bur Hammond said rhere is no
way to ptcdlct wherher that
will be successful.

“You rhink it would be,
simply because we're ihe hrsr
caucus state," she said. “In rhe

meanrime, I’m {airiy conﬁdent
rliar rhe governor [Tom

week marred by theft

By Martina Baillie
(U—WIRE) ST. LOUIS,
Mo. v

During rhe recent Gay
and Lesbian Awareness Week,
two incidences occurred on
rhe Washington Universiry
campus which may have been
moiivared by hate.

Some rime herween Oct.
3 and ii, during rhe week.
end preceding Awareness
Week, rhe banner for spec.
rrum Alliance, a srudenr
group for issues ofsexual ori.
enrarion, was srolen from the
Oak Walk. lrs disappearance

ment, which filed the incident
as a dish or properry valued
at$300.

The following Tuesday,
Vice President of Specrrum
Alliance Rebecca Bishaf re.
porred being verbally as.
saulred by rwo males in a pass.

rhrough rhe new parking ga.
rage by Gregg House.
Though Bishafcould not
ideneity rlie males, she said
rheir sraremenrs concerned
her sexualiry.

According ro WUPD ser.
geanr Mark‘ Werner, rhe lack
of evidence or wirnesses or
eirher incidenr renders inves.
eigarion all bur impossible. He
said rherrs otbanners such as
rhese are "faitlyfommon, 90

would say ir's highly unlikely
ihar rhere was any polirical
message involved,"

"Ir's hard ro know
whether it's a homophobic
incidenr or a fraternity
prank," Werner said,

Bishaf, however, claimed
rhar rhe errorr required ro re.
move the banner was a sign
or purposeful inienr againsr
rhe gay, lesbian and bisexual
(GLB) communirycclebrared
by Awareness Week.

"Someone gor a ladder
and rook it down,“ she said.
“1r muse have raken a lat of
morivarion. lr was rhe only
banner taken down [and] it
was rargered."

Presidenr orspecrrum Al.
liance,TesaSexron, could nor
be reached for comment,

According to Assisianr
Vice Chancellor for Srudonrs
and Direcror otcampus Lifc
iill Carnaghi, Gay and Les.
bian Awareness Week was a
success despite rhe incidents,
and on rhe whole, WU en.

courr
ages di-
versiry.

"I give
students that
attended these
events a real vote
of confidence,“ she
said. "[And] I would
give the institution Credit
for moving forward," she
said,

According to carnaghi,
students can alfcrd to feel safer
and more accepred ar WU
than at other campuses where
she has wotkcd.The two incl»
dcnccs during Awareness
Week were the first two of
rheir kind ro be reporred in ar
least a year, according to the
Intetim Chief of WUPD,
Lieutenant Sandra Turner.

Philosophy professor
Marilyn Friedman. who
teaches the course "Present
Moral Problems," said that the
higher Standards of safety and
tolerance that she and others
have experienced atWU natif-
ially creare a heighrened sen.
siuviry ro srudenrs or groups
targeted by hate.

"Gay and lesbian students
have told me that it's worse
elsewhere That‘s why we can‘t
ignore incidences like these,"
she said. "We should never
take the tolerant environment
for granted."

WU Residential College
Director Andy Wilson, who
leads Safe Zone, which was
created in pan ro educare sru.
dents about homosexual ise
sues, said rhe reporring ofthe
Awatcncss Week incidences
does show some positive im—
provcmcnt of acceptance on
rheWU campus.

"The GLB community has
become more vocal,“ he said,
"WU is deﬁnitely a place
where they can have a voice."
According to Wilson, srudenis
had remained more or less sie
lenr abour their experiences or
being singled our unril lasr
week. "Last week was the first
time I heard students talk
about being discmpowered."
said Wilson.

Signs of consisreni, if
subtle, discrimination around
campus are pervasive, said
Wilson. and are not accurarely
reﬂected by numbers released
by WUPD.

ﬂycrs, which

happens ro us all

the time,” said

Bishaf. "But it's an»

other thing to rear down

a banner."

Carnaghi stressed rhe im.
porrance of avoiding assump—
tions.

”1 would not want the
community (0 jump ro rhe
conclusion that [rhe person
who stole the banner] was a
member of our community.
We are an open campus."

But counting on rhar op.
tion, said Bishaf, denies the
worst.

"I don'r think those guys
spoke tor all ofWU, bur rhey
cerrainly are part ofout com.
muniry," she said.

According to Bishaf, the
events owaareness Week have
shaken her sense of safeey ar
WU,

"I was feeling that the
world had turned againsr me
in a marrer of 24 hours. Up
until this poinr, 1 felt welcome
hetc. I love this school. I'm

'shocked. Tolerance is one

thing, undersranding is an.
orher," said Bishaf

Friedman said there is a
polarized rrend of increased
accepranee of homosexualiry
and increased homophobic re.
acrions. The murder lasr year

Wyoming, exempliﬁed rho ex.
