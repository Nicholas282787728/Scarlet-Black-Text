primarily on international action based
on imues rather than individual cases.
We Wlll select human rights imues from
Asia1 Aiiica.Europe,andlatin America
based on campus»wide input and write
petitions using the fwdback we get from
the survey. The issues could be as di-
verse as health carc and education in
South Africa, sexual rights in Russia, the

for the Iowa Senate and House seats, a
petition drive for President Clinton’s
proposed health plan, and a trip to Des
Moines fora day to meet With the state
legislators.

Finally, the convention will be a
chance for students and members of the

though, since the leak is emptying
the water into a storm sewer.

“At this point it’s pretty
sketchy,” said city worker Jim
Brown at the water plant.

“As far as the time element is
conccmod, I really couldn't say,”

Brown stated. “It’s just a matter of
when we ﬁnd it.

“Once we getitpinpointed and
isolated, it will take about two hours
to get operable pressure," Brown
said.

The wamr breach is particu—
larly unfortunate on the eve of
tomorrow's men and women’s state
swim meets, women's basketball
game and Iowa state high school
