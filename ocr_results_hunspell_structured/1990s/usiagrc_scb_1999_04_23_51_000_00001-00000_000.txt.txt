Iowa Interstate Railroad, hit with
'tickcr shock over what it would cost

niemal study focusing on more mode

However, Vince Castagno, Iowa
ntcrstarc’sviee president for sales and
narketing, told The Herald-Register
i-lday that his Iowa City-based com-
any remains eager to institute passen-
er service between Chicago and Des

oines in cooperation with Amtrak
nd 1&M Rail Link of Davenport.

Castagno would not reveal a dollar

cost for a rail upgrade between the
Quad Cities and Des Moincs, the por-
tion of the line for which Iowa Intern
state is responsible.

“I'd love to, butl won’t,” Castagno
said when asked the projected cost of
the rehabilitation in order to allow pas-
senger trains to run at nearly 60 mph.
“But it‘s a huge number, a very large
number.”

The alternative: slower trains

That‘s why Iowa Interstate is con—
ducting a second study that would en—
able trains to run at “a consistent 40
mph all the way across" the Daven-
port-to-Des Memes route, Castagno
said.

Rail officials are scheduled to meet

with members ofPoweshlek Arcn Der
velopmenttlns Thursday to update area
leaders on the status of plans to run
passengertrainsthrough Griuneli, and
Castagno gavc The HeraldrReglster a
preview of what will be discussed at
that meeting.

In February, Castagne said rhat
Amtrak could be running a passenger
train on the route as early as next year.
While that’s still a possibility, the for

“Our tracks right now would be ad

“It’s a good example or how some
seed money can really go a long way,“
i-larkiii remarked. “Hopefully we can
get some more back into this program,
because it's worthwhile."

The program is especially important
for smaller communities where it is
more difﬁcult to raise money for hous-
ing pmjccts, he added

But Harkin said communities like
Brooklyn are viable ones that deserve
assistance in developing additional
housing.

“Brooklyn's not going to dry up and
blowaway," hedeclured. “It'sgoing to

live here and raisethcirkids. The people
who are going to move in [to the new
Brooklyn houses]canwalktwo blocks

that."

U.S., state DOTS should back
local rail passenger project

Vince Castagno, Iowa Interstate Railroad's vice president for sales and
marketing, told us the otlicr day that a proposed passenger train that would
mn through Grinnell is still a viable idea, even though a consultant's study
has shown that upgrading tracks will cost big bucks.

As we report on page I today, that study (Castagno wouldn’t reveal exact
ﬁgures) focused on rehabilitating the track to accommodate trains traveling
up to 59 mph, When cost projections shocked Iowa Interstate, it decided to
conduct its own study with the idea ofupgrading tracks to the point that
trains could move along at 40 mph, Although that study won't be finished for
a few days, it’s clear that thc trimmed-down version would cost a lot 1ch and
is probably more doable from the milroad's point ofvicw.

There will be lots ofpeople who ask whether it makes any economic sense
to install ncw ties and otherwise improve rail infrastructure simply to Itave a
three—car passenger train poking along at a mere 40 mph when someone can
drive a legal ()5 mph or take a plane There are several reasons why it does.

First, not everyone is in that big a
hurry. Someone traveling between,
say, Des Molnes and Chicago might
like the more leisurely pace, being
able to avoid parking hassles at
airports, heavy interstate traffic and
long shuttles between ailports and
the downtown area.
Also, it’s going to cost a lot lcss
it‘you take the train rather than ﬂy.
The food in the dining car sure wtlI beat that airline snack. And, for a little
extra money, you’ll be able to sleep in an actual benii. Relaxing in a comfon-
able rail car is a lot more pleasant than a wlliteeknuckle drive, too.

No, rail travel isn't for CVCIyOnC, But we suspect that it‘s for enough
people that it makes economic sense. Eventually, the major upgrade neces-
sary for higher-speed trains can be accomplished, and that will draw even
more passengers.

That's why, wtth Aintrak’s backing, Iowa Interstate and its Illinois
counterpart, 1&M Rail Link, should be able to make a good case for ﬁnancial
support from the Us. Department ofTransportalton and the Iowa DOT.
There may be other funding sources for the rail-passenger plan, but those are
the big ones. The Iowa Departmerii ol‘Transpontttion, of course, annually
comes up with a five-yeal plan that addresses all oI‘lowa’s transportation
needs, rrom roads to bridges, from metropolitan bus lines to railroads, The
DOT commissioners should readily scc thc efficacy ofadding a passenger
line servuig the lruijor Iowa communities of Davclipon, Iowa City and Des
Moines. 'ln ille process, iowlls like Grinlicll and Newton also will beneﬁt.

Local ofﬁCIals here must continue to work closely with Iowa lntclslate and
the other entities involved to push for rail passenger service. I'owcshiek Arca
Dcvclopltlcnt and other organizations are doillgjust that, ofcoursc, but it has
to be an ongoing effort. And that includes lobbying the various funding
sources so that this wonderful idea can become a reality in tho not-too-dlstant
future.

case

Former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley speaks to a large crowd at the Senior
Center Saturday, offering his view ofAmerica's future and discussing
such issues as NATO's actions in Yugoslavia.

By JOHN BREEMER

Newslapllilon editor

Former Senator and New York
Knicks star Bill Bradley brought his
quest for the 2000 Democratic presir
dentlal nomination to Grinncll Satur-
day morning, speaking to a standing-
t-oom-only crowd at the Senior Center.

Bradley, who scivcd forthrcc terms
in the U.S. Scnatc before retiring In
January 1997, is the only Democrat to
challenge vice President Al Gore for
his party's nomination next year.

in Gnnncll, he spoke to a diverse
crowd about issues ranging from
Bosniatopcrsonﬂlresponsibility,froin
health insurance to racial halmorty,

Although The W‘dll Street Journal
oiicerererrcdto Bradleyasapohtician
“whom the Vice president inighi best in
a charisma contest," his Grinnell audir

cncc was anything but bored. People
listened intently as Bradley offered his
vision for the nation and talked ofllis
oﬁepostponcd presidential bid.

First considered bid in 1988

He first thought ofrunning in was.
Bradlcy said. But he decided that he
wasn’t ready,

“Four years later I looked at myself
in the lnlrror and said, you're leady,"
he recalled. “But there was something
within me that said no. don‘t do this.
So I honored that iIIIIcI voice and did
not run in 1992."

Bill Clinton, of course, did run. and
he won. with tlte president ﬁrmly in
control In I996, the decision not to run
was made for Bradley. Now. though.
