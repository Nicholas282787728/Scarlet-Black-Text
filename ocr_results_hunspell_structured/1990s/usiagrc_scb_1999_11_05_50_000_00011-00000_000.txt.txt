Harry Potter,
Tool of Lucifer

By Dan Rothschild

The “New york Times" had a
disrurbing srory on irs frorrr page
on Monday. The srory was abour
several parenr groups across rhe
corrnrry who are proresring J K,
Rowling's“Ha1rry Potter" book se.
ries.Tliis. '

’ by eduearors rhroughoiir rhe coun.
rry for bringing a generarion raised
on reievisron and video games ro rhe
magic of rho wrrrren word. Tire
“New York Tlmcs Book Rcvluw”
compares Rowllng ro children’s aua
rhor Roald Dahl. “Newsweek",
“USA Today," “The Chicago Tri.
bune." “Publishers weekly," “The

London Guardian," “The school Library Journal,” and
“Booklisr” are among rhe many journals which have also
praised rhis series. currenrly rhree books and seven mils

So whar mighr rhese parenrs be complaining about?
Whar bad ihings could be said abour a series which gers
rheir children reading, insread orwarching laremighr
Cinemax and playing such wholesome video games as
Doom and Tomb Raider?

Simple. errle Harry Poucr is rhe spawn ofLucrfer.

True ro rhe prevalenr young adolescenr fanrasy genre,
i-larry Poucr involved spells, wirches, poisons, dragons,
and rhe whole gamur offanrasy lirerary rools and shame.
rers. Harry's world is a far cry from “Dick and Jane." Whar
separared Harry from orher young adolescenr fanrasy (like
C.s, Lewiss allegorical “Narnia Chronicles") is rhar chil.
dren 7 even rhose who have never been inreresred in roads
mg beiore _ really seem re be raken in by his world. 50
wherein lies rhe danger?

lfyou ask rhe religious rrghr (and you don't have ro
ask, they'll jusr rell you). Harry represenrs a dark side of
fanrasy in which sorcery, wirchcrafr, and rhe occiilr are
raughr ro children as being pcrfeerly normal parrs ofrherr
growing up. The fanrasy realm ro rhe religious righr is a
world ofuncerrainry, nor ruled by rheir inrerprerarion of
God bur by supernarural forces. Even ifrhis world exists
only in rhe rmaginarinn ofchildren, rr is srrll a dangerous
rhrear ro rhe religions righr’s way of life, Thar is one of
rhe saddesr aspecrs ofrhe righrs dccpnscnicd fear- a childs
ianrasy represenrs ro rhem a rhrear ro rherr enrire sysrem
oireligious beliefand pracrice surely ir rakes more rhan

, More rhan anyrhrng, whar rhis whole marrer really
illusrrares is rhar rhe religious righr, which has been [ry-
ing ro make irselfmere appealing ro mainsrrearrr America
for rhe pasr half decade, is really just as brearre now as
ever. Despire rheir homegrown public relarions ploys ro
prove rhar Rcv. Jerry Falwell isn't really virrrolically lio-
mophobic, rhar “praying for rhelcws" doesn’t reveal subrle

aliae rhar fanrasy is an innare parr ofchrldhood (and should

Children need ro ranrasiae ro develop rheir minds.
Harry Porrer has broughr millions ofchildren ro rhe world
ofbrnrasy and rhe wonder ofrhewrirren word, a fear which
is oursranding by mosr educators’ srandards. Hopefully,
rhe religious rrghr will find a bigger monsrer and chal.

Self-Govemance doesn ’1‘ need more bureaucracy
By Paul Pender

During Sepremher, ir somehow dawned on cerrarn
members ofscA rhar Hal] Councils needed ro be grearly
expanded in rheir inﬂuence and power, This errrious un.
derraking drew varied responses from rhe resr of SGA,
which ranged from :yeballerolllng ro headnscmzching. in
rhe end, SGA acriiaily alrered rherr hallowed consrirurion
ro give Hall Councils “ﬁnal voice" on eerrain dorm issues.

This poinrlsss change was widely ignored by rhe cam.
pus, and was iusr abour ro be cleanly swepr under our
inﬁnite rug ofaparhy unril a loner appeared in lasr weeks
soeli, The lerrer was basically a rehashing ofwhar mosr
already know 7 rr srared rhar l—lall Councils are supposed
ro be a forum for every dorm residenr ro voice concerns
on dorm issues, The lerrer rhen wenr on inro rhe useless
legaliries and speciﬁes oirhe albimporranr scA constitu»
rion which essenrially now allows Hall Councils an am.
biguous power 0F“ﬂnu| voice."To make marrers even more
qucsnonable rhe aurhors of rho lerrer wenr on ro claim
rhar “historical reasons" were behind rhrs change. and rhar
“selirmprovemenr . . . necessrrares them."

First oFall, whar exacrly does “self—improvemenr" mean
when applied ro dorm life? is rhis a new rrend ro keep our
rooms cleaner and share rhe vacuum cleaner more erfie
cienrly rhar I’ve missed? The menrion of“hisrorical rea-
sons" calls ro mind rhe "grear debates” in Hall Council
hisror-y such as rhe “Dawson’s Creek vs. Seinfeld" crisis of
‘98 and rhe “Should we painr Gardner?" conrroversy of
lasr year. Apparenrly rhese hisrorieal impacrs were so grear
rhar Hall Councils could nor solve rhings unless rhey had
inﬁnire creecurivc powers.

Regardless ofhow limrred Hall Councils obviously are,
and regardless orrhe facr rhar arrendanee ro said meerings
peaks around 5% oidorm residenrs, rhe largesr misrake
rhis change makes is by misinrerprering rhe enrire con.

cepr ofselfgovernance. Self—governance, even deﬁncd in
she srudenr Handbook, is basically a ser ofprincrples rhar
advocare respecrful livrngameingsr individuals in an unn
supervised environmenr wirh iew aurhoriry ﬁgures. No-
where does ir say rhar, “you are responsible for crearrng a
vasr bureaucracy oforganrrarions and groups mar will give
aurhoriry re a selecr group of people rhar will arrempr ro
derermine srudenr residenr policy,"

self-governance is bear undersrood as simply doing
wharever you wanr ro, as long as ir doesn’t infringe upon
orhers. lfyou do infringe, ir is implied rhar such a prob-
lem will be worked our berween rhe individuals. Unfor»
runarely, many rhink self—governance is besr embodied
by groups like Srudcnr Affairs and SGA. The realiry, how.
ever, is rhar mosr srudenrs enjoy and pracriee selfgover—
nance very well and never ralk ro rheir RLC or borher ro
read rhe SGA minures.

The srudenr handbook also srares rhar “residenr life
philosophy rs based on sclfcgovemancc, a matrix rhar in-
cludes SGA, Srudcnr Affairs Srafr, Commirree on Sm»
denr Life, rhe judicial sysrem, and rhe Hall Council,"
Making Hall Councils more powerful will simply add
more unnecessary bureaucracy re a sy-srem rhar already
can run and survive by irselr.

The lerrer concludes by asking, “Ifwe can work our a
sysrem ofseligovernmenr, why shouldn'r we?“ Whar rhrs
quesrion really seems re ask is, “Ifwc can make rhis self—
brrreaueracy moreconiusingandelurrered,whyshouldn'r
wt?" Sorry ro clue rhe aurhors in, bur we’ve already had a
“sysrem” ofselfgovernanco here for many years, and ob.
viously even adminrsrrarors like Tom Crady feel conﬁ»
denrenough in us and oursysrem rhar when budger—rime
came around lasr year rhey weren'r afraid ro rrim some of
rho selfbureauera far.
