his skills by managing 82 yards on

be prolific, the story of the game was
the effort of the Pioneer defense. The
Grinnell defenders held the Lions to a
mere 93 yards and forced seven tum-
overs en route to the team's first shut

back Sean Paulson turned in a stellar

performance. Not only did he record
11 tackles, but he also turned nwzly a
