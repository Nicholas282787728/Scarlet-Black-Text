orrhe 159 srudenrs assigned to work in dining
services, only abour 120 orrhose studenrs chose
rn ﬁll out applicarions ro work in rhe dining halls.
The reasons for choosing not re work are many.
Academic work load, cxttacuttlculat activities
such as arhlerrcs, and scheduling coniliets can all
play a role,

some students have suggested thar rhe den
chne in rhe work roree may be a rcilecrion era
changing campus. Perhaps fewer srudenn are
working because more new students are able to
pay tuition wiLhout work study. However, accord

rhis is not rhe case.
