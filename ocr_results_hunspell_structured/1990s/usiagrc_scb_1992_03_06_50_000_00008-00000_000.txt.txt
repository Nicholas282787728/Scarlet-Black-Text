The Grinnell College women‘s
swimming team captured its ﬁrst
Midwest Conference championship
since narrowly edging Lake Forest
by twopointsin 1988. Last weekend's
meet was not quite as close. though.
as Grinnell once again prevailed over
the defending champion Formters.
637-610.

On the ﬁrst day, the Pioneers es
tablished an ll~p0int lead after the
meet‘s first event, the 400 individual
medley. Sophomore Liz Fields set
the tone for her teammates by smash-
ing the school record in that event
witlt a 4:52.77 clocking en route to
her first of three individual confer-
ence titles. After that, Grinnell went
on torack upacommandingGO-point
lead after the first day and never
looked back.

Fields‘ other feats included set»
ting new school, pool, and confer
ence records in the 100and 200 back-
strokes with times of 1:02.16 and
2:13.23. For the second year in a
row,herperfonrtanceinthe200quall-
fled her for the NCAA swimming
and diving championships to be held
in Buffalo, NY March 12-14. Coach
Ray obermiller said, “Liz deserves
credit for her pan irt five champion-
ships (including both medley relays)
but all 20 deserve credit for the Win."

Senior Alyson Jepsen was deft
nitely one of those 20 outstanding
performers. She turned in a third
place in the mile, second in the 200
free, and ﬁnished her career by Chas
ing down and touching out freshman

for the 500 free championship in

Julie Cross, Amy Oggel, and
Mercedes Danfonh to win the 800

pool records in 8:19.29.

Andrea Jackson gave Grinnell’s
most valuable effort by a freshman.
She finished second in both breast-
stroke races, third in the 200 indi-
vidualmedley,andjoinedforees with
teammates Fields, Daria Danley, and
Shiela Tom to win and set a new
school record in the 200 medley rer
lay, and school and pool records in

records. Junior Danley nipped 06 of _

a second off the 200 butterﬂy school

record by cruising to third place in ’

2:26.56.

Freshman diver Ingrid Swenson
set the school and pool record in the
new one-meter diving (10dives) com-
petition with 317.85 points, narrowly

edging Lake Forest’s Janet Mathew ‘

by less than four points. Sophomore
Lisa Swift took third on the three-
meter board (10 dives) and estabr
lishedanew school record with 310.60
points.

Last year Lake Forest outscored
Grinnell, 113716,on both boards,but
this year's expanded diving squad of
Swenson, Swift, Holly Kellar, and
Allison Nelson turned the tables and
edged the Foresters, 69763. The other
major difference was the return of
senior Mercedes Danforth to the learn
aftersitting out last season. Danforth
finalled in all of her individual events
and swam a valuable leg on the 800
free relay.

The Pioneers are happy with their
conference championship, but must
now bid farewell to eightseniors who
have worked for the last four years to
earn that title. Obenniller summed it
up, “I am most happy for the seniors.
It was their leadership that provided
the spark.“

warm-up

for conference meet

By Cory Conover

Last weekend‘s State Small Col-
lege meet was a huge success for the
Pioneers. KatePeterson set aschool
record in the 300,placing fourth with
a time of 44.67. The old record had
stood for ten years. She also placed
sixth in the 400, setting a personal
record and missing another school
record by one second

Other top ﬁnishers for the Pio-
neers were the 4x200 relay team of
Peterson, Rommany Chanthavong,
Jennifer Jones, and Melanie Parson
and the 4x800 relay team of Jessica
Henry, Jessica Madoc-Jones, Aubry
Wick and Jennifer Jacobson, which
both finished sixth in their respective
races.

Coach Evelyn Freeman com-
mented, “It was a chance for us to
compete against schools in another
warm-up to the conference meet," In
looking forward to that competetion
Freeman remarked, ”Our work ethic
is amazing. The time differences
logged in from the beginning of the

year to this point, even though we
have had a shon season, show the
dedication of these athletes."

Because of the small size of this
year’s squad, they have concentrated
on individual events and some key
relays. “A conference rule change
which comes into effect this year per-
mits teams to enter three contestants
in one event. This favors strong teams
with big numbers; in essence, the rich
are getting richer,” concluded Free~
man.

Although the season did not l'i sh
with quite the excitement and glam-
ourlhat it hadhopcd for,thcwomen‘s
basketball team cannot be disap-
pointed with thc13-11 record which
their endeavors earned them. The sea-
son ended last Saturday after the Pier
neers earned a benh in the Midwest
Conference Tournament, but were
unable to come away with a win.

They started the tournament by
playingtheeventualchamptons,Lake
Forest, in a defensive battle which
came down to the final seconds. In
one of the lowest scoring games of
the season, Grinnell fell 46-45.
Grinnell'sdefense held the hometeam
to just 16 points in the second half,
but the offense sputtered, missing
three opportunitiesinthe final minute
and a half to take the lead.

After the discouraging loss. Coach
Eskildsen said, “We just ran out of
time. Our defense was holdin g them,
but we just could not quite score the
gorahead bucket. Even though these
two teams had not played each other
previously this year, we both played
iike we knew each other well."

Coach Eskildsen felt that a big
reason for the Pioneer’s lack of of»
fense was the fatigue which was
caused by the numerous defensive
changes which Grinnell used to stop
Lake Forest. Eskildsen said. “Their
dribble penetration offense was
stopped by our variety of defensive
changes. They became less sure of
what they wanted to do. The down
side of our great defense was that we
were tired at the other end of the
court."

While the result of the game was
disappointing for the team, Coach
Eskildsen reiterated a theme which
has been present throughoutthe year:
”Likeeverygamethisycar,theygave
this game everything they had, They
played tough and refused to give up
easily. They carried themselves like
the true champions they are. I have
never been prouderofateam than this
particular team, and much of that
prideisbecause this groupreachcd its
potential and then exceeded what was
expected of them.”

In the Saturday consolation game,
Grinnell was paired with Illinois Col»
lege, a rival which had beaten the
Pioneers twice this year already. For

point for point with the much bigger
Illinois team, 50-50. Illinois then got
hot and Grinnell went cold as Illinois
went on a 1572 rampage in the final
five minutes to win 65-52.

It was another heartbreaking loss
for the team, which had not been
expected tobeable to defendits chamr
pionshipoflastyear.CoachEskildsert
drove home the point of how impres-
sive the team’s effort was this year.
“Just the fact that we were in the
position to win it all proves how
unique this group is. This group
worked harder, cared more, and gave
more than could ever have been ex-
pected, and 313-11 record is a won-
derful accomplishment for them. All
acoach can ask is tobe competitivein
each of the games you play, and we
were in 22 of the 24, That accom—
plishment took consistent, persistent
effort from everyone."

Eskildsen ended his ﬁnal inter—
view of the year by sending out the
typeofpraise whiehacoach doesnot
often feel comfortable sending out.
“In the 17 years which I have been
coaching, this is by far my favorite
team. By far.”
