placed 55'” in 21:10 and Geny Riester
‘98 was 72"“ with a time 21:38.
“First-year students Idelle Cooper
and Sarah Baker continue to im-
prove. I also thought Amy Moore
ran well." Freeman added.

“Our team is young. so we are tak-
ing it one week at a time. We have
had steady progression while attain-
ing our short-range goals. but our
long—range goal is to recapture the
Midwest Conference title." Freeman
said.

The team is traveling to Rock Is
land for the Augustana Invitational
today. The meet will feature some
high—ranking teams. including
Carleton and Washington University.

“Augustana's course usually pro-
duces fast times. It was the site of
nationals two years ago." com-
mented Coach Evelyn Freeman.

The Les Duke invitation proved
highly successful for the men’s team
as well. Nationally ranked Washing-
ton University and Augustana fin-
ished 1-2 at the event with scores of
33 and 65. The Pioneers were third
at 113 While Graceland edged Cen-
tral. 146455 for fourth place.

“We ran a solid race." Freeman
said. “With top runners Dan
Madigan and Neil Gipson compet-

ing with colds, it was difficult for us
to do any better."

Rookie Rob Park ‘01 ConLinued
to impress Coach Freeman as he fin-
ished sixth in a time of 27:1 1. His
classmate, John Aerni. clocked a
27:25 to place 12th.

“Rob and John are proving they
are for real.” offered the coach. .

The Pioneers had a grouping of
five who stayed close together and
rounded out the scoring. Madigan
‘00 went 28:11 for 29th, Kevin
Notheis ‘98 finished 32nd in 28:14
and Nat Hopkins ‘98 ran a 28:27 to
ﬁnish 24th. Gipson ‘98 and Casey
Miller ‘00 were the pushers by place
ing 42"" and 45‘“.

Last fall the Pioneers relinquished
their Midwest Conference crown to
Monmouth for the ﬁrst time in 11
seasons. Grinnell is out to regain the
title and Saturday’s performance
may be a good omen. The harriers
finished ahead of both Knox and
Monmouth.

“Monmouth did not run all of
their ninners. but I think we showed
that we are focused on getting that
conference title back to Grinnell."
said the coach. “We hope to have
all our top seven runners healthy and
closing the gap between the ﬁrst and
fifth runners afAugustana.”

After enduring two disheartening
losses last weekend, the Grinnell

things around. The kickers have a

Gustavus." commented Wood. “We
fought hard, but they capitalized on
the few mistakes that we made.
knocking in 4 goals on 18 shots. I
am. however, not discouraged be-
cause we are making progress. We
learned some valuable lessons from
a good game."

Against St. Olaf the Pioneers
came out hard and showed a great
deal of intensity and desire. The con—
test was a seesaw battle for much
of the first half as each team took
turns controlling the ball. With' the
half winding down. the two teams
were locked in a 00 tie until the Oles
impressively scored two goals in the
last moments of the ﬁrst period.

“We played well for the ﬁrst 40
minutes.” remarked Wood. “Then
St. OlafJust took advantage of our
mistakes and scored twice with less
than ﬁve minutes in the half. The
momentum had shifted and although
