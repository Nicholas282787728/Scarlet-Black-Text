a smiling Castro being carried

proven wholly untrue.

Castro’s right hand man, ”Che”
Guevara, told a “Look" reporter
that the Cubans are triendly with
Russia because of the economic

it impossible to report even the
bare facts it thcy contlict with
the Russt'dn monster stereotype
they have conjured up tor the
American public. l

The sin oi omission is quite
prevalent on radio and in dailyi
yellow sheets, as indicated by
the recent report oi thodefection
ot the Estonian, viktor Jannis
mctz. He is quoted as saying
“Satellite nations have to work
as slaves for the Russmns and,
get very little themselves.” Thcrc,

whether there was any credence)
to his allegations It was merely
left in the bold manner it was,
made by Jannimetz, so naturally
everyone tends to think, “This

the iron cut-tam,"
