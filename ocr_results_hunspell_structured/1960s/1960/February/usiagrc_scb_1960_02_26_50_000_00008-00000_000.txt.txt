Individual scoring
are unavailable this week:
however, Ran Ochsner and

ker are still 1—2 in the scor-
ingrace,

To glance into the future, he-
gotiations have been completed
in the proposed extramural eon-
tests between' Grinnell and
Knox. For those individuals on
campus who have not been in»
formed about this
the idea was originated in dis-
cussions -b c t w c e n President
Bowen and the Knox president.
The suggestion was made that
Knox would send representative
teams in basketball and bowling
to Grinnell on a given day to

 

statistics

compete with Grinnell teams in!

an intramural situation.

The proposal was discussed
at length by the Intramural
Board and received unanimous
support. Correspondence with
the Knox intramural onieinls
has arranged for Knox to send
a basketball and bowling team

. to cinnell Saturday, March
19, if this experiment proves
successful, Grinnell will send
a softball anti golf team to
Knox sometime in the spring.

There are still some prob»
lems concerning

turn out to be a lot or full andl
very beneﬁcial for everyone con-

In addition, there is also
the possibility that in the in.
ture, a program oi extramural
competition oi this type can
be expanded to include other
schools in the conlercnce. We

are all very proud ot' the

AS student statistician for

duties begin with the iirst
football game in the tall and
terminate with the iinal base-
ball contest in the spring. In
between. he attends every

home nllil roadeiuutbnll and

i baseball game,
every Grinnell basketball

l duel.

i In tootball Fry keeps track

of each player: who carried the

ball, how many yards were
gained. who made the tackle,
the number and distance of

,punts, passing completions and
iyai-dage, and just about any
thing else that happens.

Basketball and baseball rec
ceive the same thorough treat—
ment as everything from
shooting percentages to double
dribbtes and from home runs
i to hit batsmen is recorded.

The job is too big for one

stayed in the game for eight

James

a the Editor:
Now that the new dorm is
almost butll, ihc library com»

plated, and there is speculation
about building a field house or
a natatorium, i would like to
suggest a really valuable way
in which some school innds
might be spent, mainly to cut
down the grcat amount oi
noise in the old halls on north
campus, c.g, Rawson. Clark,
Gates, ctc.

As 1 write this letter from
my room with the door closed,
1 can hear someone flushing
the toilet and expectorating
in the washroom across the
hall. if you think this is re,-

. . . . .
pulsive in print, you can im—

agine how bad it actually
. sounds.
Further, if someone on the

first floor calls a student to We
phone or belches, the sounds
corne clearly reverberating up
the stairwell to the third floor.

With the stone floors and
plaster walls and ceilings;
sound cascades around these
old dormitories as it they
were huge steel barrels,

i would thus propose, if the
administration is really inter»
ested in spending a few dollars
for the welbbcing of thc leI~
dents, (1) rubber tile floors and
asbestos ceilings like those in
North Younkcr, (2) rubber in.
sulating strips on all door
frames to cut down the noise

of slamming doors, (3) addition-
al rubber places on all ioile|
bowls and washroom Walls sr

that the hanging of a toilet seat

cannot be heard three floo s
away, (all any other means po -
sible to cut down and a rip

 

the noise which inevitably aiiscs
in thc dormitories.
