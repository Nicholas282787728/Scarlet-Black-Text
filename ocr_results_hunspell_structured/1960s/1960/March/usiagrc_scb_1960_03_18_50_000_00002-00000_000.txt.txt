Integrated Campuses t

in this issue of the Scarlet and Black theie is a letter
from Mr. Giant Gale (physics) in which he discusses the
lnteglatcd campuses proposal.

Among other well picsented points, Mi Gale says
(‘riinnell has made its name and fame as a I
deuce college largely tlllotigli its doi'u’iitoly system.” While
tllis may lime at one .time been ttuc, we cannot see lion
such statements as those made by the North Central
Association agency, concerning the physical separation of
the tu'o campuses, can contribute to either Name or Fame.

While Mr, Gale says that the college \\ s ”visioned
as separate men and women’s campuses with the com-
llltm academic e pel'ience,” the accrediting agency said,
and no repeat. The primary impoltance 01 the men sl
Collette and the \\"omelis college lntelieies with the concept‘
oi the unified coeducational colleges"

And while, as Mr. Gale says, we do “ant “common
academic experiences," we also feel that even in the
“Han ird of the Midwest (Timcharch ‘7, 1960)” academic
expel' lice s not the sole g'oal, mtich less the only cnnr,
tl'ibilting lactor to the growth and m’dtlil'ation of the sturr
dcnts. ‘

As to the “large group of men alid Women who are no
longer interested iii being just boys and girls together’
this is just the point we are tryingr to make. Boys and g'll'ls
play ill their separate isolated narrowed bunches. Is this the
realization ul' thc “Grinnell vision”? We hope not, i

It is true that many- less

over the campus as well as
the town, and many oi these

cummmiiue either sex without

could do the same by putting
girls in Blulii house and boys
in Pine Tree, (The Blumer

But through the ycais Picsi
