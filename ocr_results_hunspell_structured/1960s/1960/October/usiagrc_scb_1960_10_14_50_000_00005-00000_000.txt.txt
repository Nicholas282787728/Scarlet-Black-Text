INDIA
Cont, from p.
various levels through election.
In a country beset with as,
many problems as India has“
such methods are bound to win
support from those dissatislied
with thc ettorts or the party
in power. There are several fat»
tors within Ilidla~ that have
made the communists- iob even
easier.
One

it

has been the fact. that

dissenters have practically nu~
where else to go The other
parties are either inetlective or
indistinguishable from the cans
gross trom which they have
split, This condition gives the
communists support from many
who just think it is “lime tor a
change."

Another tactor in their iavor
is Nehru's indulgent attitude Les
ward communism, Nehru as a
socialist has iound himself in
sympathy with the communists
on many issues. He has let th
seeming agreement obseurc thei
basic disagreement on the neces-
sity ot democracy

'Another weakness is that Con»
gress contains many diverse
elements that are otten held
together only by the tradition
of Congress The vast majority
of the democrats of India are‘
in the Congress party regard-,
less of how conse vative m‘l
libcral they are This leads to
a great deal of discension and
inetticieney within the party asl
one extreme attempts to control}
the other.

It has long been iclt that
what the Indian political sit—
uation needs is the tonnation
or a strong conservative dem-
ocratic party. This would al- ,
low Congress to better de-
, fine its purpose as a socialist ,
party and would serve as a l
counterbalance against the
leftist tradition that has dom— ,
inatcd India. 1

It is encouraging to note that‘
the newly formed Swatantra;
party is endeavoring to till th
vacancy. Hill is able to win

support, it may well correct-
many of the factors that have
been in the communists' favor.

The communist cause has
been discredited by two chains
of events, both of which began
in 1957. The tirst is the Sino-,
India border dispute; the seas,

~ond, the victory and pertcrm-l
ance of the th t communist
government to win control of al
state within India. ‘

Nehi‘u’s illusions about com-l
munism had spread to his cloak,
ings with China. With China's
aggressive acts in Tibet and on
the Sino—Tndian border, he and

However the greatest blow tor
the CPI's prestige came il'um‘
an event which at first seemed:
to be its greatest advance, In:
Keraia, a pl'ot'el’trstl‘lcken

won an overwhelming victory in ,
the state elections. This victory

thing that could have happened}
for the cause of democracy.

First of all, a valuable les-
son was learned about the
way in which the communists
can come to power. Kerala is
not a typical poor state in
that it has a very good educa-
tional system. A, large pro.
portion of the voters are well
educated.
