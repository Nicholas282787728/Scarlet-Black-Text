'Don Juan

by Mike Burr
and

Doc Davenport

Last Saturday as the first‘

pel Ol'mﬂllce of George Ber»
nai'd Shaw's “Doll Juan in
Hell” ended, the Gl‘lllllell
audience wrote the
for the most out
Player production of the seas
soil \iltli enthusiastic
sincere applause.

The four “senior” members ol‘

the Grll‘lncll Players, Joe N

“it (Don Juan), Ellen Fetermlle
(lhc‘

(Dona Ana), Bob Clapp
Commander) and Al Stanley
[the Devil). all gave pariorm-
anccs which were not only
praiseworthy but which sct a
new ~taiidard of excellence lor
the G nncll stage.

Technically, the play was
clean and simple: tour black
and while stools, tour music
stands and a subtle backs
ground sct. 0t lirst one could
not help but tiiink that

uol physical and technical difr
ticultics which havc played
havoc with so many Grilmell
productions. not as tho pllly
progressed, it became evident
that the actors, not the sat,
made the success.

NESslf and Clapp both g‘ .
the usual fine pcrtorniance
which Gl'lllnell has grown
anticipate Stanley and Peter-
silic portormcd with particular
excellence

Stanley. with superior
and expression, gave the show
a rare, ztlmtist prolcssional ca‘se.
Miss Petersille, perhaps more
than the others, was‘ able to
use her c'yes and tacc to develop
her character and in doing so,
added vitality and lightness to
thc play, which helped to draw
the audience into the drama.

From beginning to end, the
cast had to hold
through Shaw's complex coni—
binatlons of ideas and trcquont
intermin a bly long passages.
Stanley's reading ot two tull
pugcs coupled with tho audi—
ence's absorption in what was
being said, exemplified the
characteristic tincsse with which
the entire cast overcame this
ditticulty.

They created and held llll~
pressionistic c h n roctcrizattons
with their voices, which in
turn held thc audience and
directed attention to the vol--
bal content oi thc lincs. All
icur surmounted the torpor
which too ottcn accompanies
readings

One criticism might hc that
therc should have been more
movomcnt, not large movements
but movements Coming trom
limbs, shoulders and faces. Be-
cause the stools were -hlgh,
movement on and

tended to be awkward. And

while one felt that there should]

have been more movement, the
fact remains that when the
movement did comc, it was
strong, meaninful and comfort-
lng.

ithan this, Mr Bergman has han-

linteresting plot with such amazrl

task to understand just what
Mrl Bergman was trying lol
ihmvever, this seems (0‘
me almost completely heside,
the point. ,
Expreuonism has at the samcl
time a umvcrsol and an cx-l
trcincly personal appeal. it is
univcr.l bccousc it directs lt-l
self at the strangé world \vlllcll‘
lies somewhcrc bctwccn the Con-‘
scious and thc sub-consciou

sclt of the shackles of thc all
and thus allows coch individual

pcricncc the pi c ot art in any
way that he is tible‘\\tlh no

-prctation is right or wrong in
relation to what lhc artist lllmr

Thus “The Magician” llts is
the cosc ivith all exprossion- ‘
ism) leaves itscll opcn iur ,
many interpretations, none at .
which, in my opinion, is
“right" but all oi which are
"true" in tho personal sense.
For mc. then, the “organizing
principlc" ct Mr Bergmali'
nnstcrplccc is simply the over
in. stem struggle bctwccn the
real and the um'cal, the tl'ue‘
and tlle- ialsc, bctwccn appears;
lancc and r ality.

‘Borgman says that nothing is

no truthibut only lics.

1 Thomas Story ‘Same Old Tritk';

by L. Kathryn Ellis

mmlllvlii Among thc Mom'-
" is a book which maintains
dubious popularity ycar
