SCARLET AND BLACK

 

owles Discusses

Disarmament, US. Foreign Frolic

by PM Huber
(proof editor)

Congressman Chester Bowlcs.
~esterday combined his frank
ncss, his sincere interest in the
underdeveloped countries, and|
his support of John Kennedy tori
the Democratic presidential nom.i
ination, One of the results was
his statement in a Scarlet and
Black interview that Kennedy's
Catholicism was the only fan-t
tor which prompted questions
on whether Kennedy would give
ioreign aid for the purpose of
birth control,

Bowlcs said that the lmple- I
nientation of birth control in
over-populated areas depended
not on foreign aid but on the
development or an economical
contraceptive. lie added that
research on this could he in-
creased although religious i - i
sues would not permit it to he I
done by the us. government. ,

Bowles hopes that the United;
States will provide about one—i
half of the foreign capital necesei
sary tor India’s third ﬁveeyeal‘
plan. As tar as recent economic
growth in India is concerned, he
says, “It is better than i feared,
although not as good as l
hoped."

The versatile congressman sup.
ported the position of Asian and
Airican neutral nations with
practical political thought, ideal-
ism and historical references.

Bowles said that we cannot
ignore the 30 percent or the
electorate which is Roman
Catholic He was asked about
the Question posed by James i
lteston or the New York
Times: will the result or the
Wisconsin primary “divide the
parties along religious lines?” I
Bowles said, “1 don't. think it
will, although it may to some
degree," r
' “Is the difference between
Kennedy and Humphrey primar—t
ily on domestic issues?” Bowlcs
was asked. “Actually there is
no difference between them,” he
replied. in Wisconsin, be ex
plained, there appeared to be
a substantial difference between‘

them on the [arm question.

What dinercnee there had
been between Humphrey's and
Kennedy‘s previous positions
on agriculture was due pri—
marily to the fact that one
represented Minnesota and the
other Dlﬂssilchusetlsi

Bowlcs believes that a bigi
step in the solution oi the fal‘in‘
problem could be made by
sending as much as one—halt or,
our iarm surplus abroad, He he:
licves that Public law 480 can;
be the framework tor this Ins
creased agricultural aid, but it
wouldniecd some revision. “We
approach this problem
with more imagination," he em—
phaslzed.

As far as disarmament is con.
cerned, Bowlcs used his calm
but forceful manner to say that
it will not be an issue in the
campaign. President Eiscnhavw
crs position on the control of
atomic testing is basically right,
the Democrat said.

Tire major criticism

administration's disarmament
policy is that it has not put
enough emphasis on the sub.
For example, the non»

in Washington have been
working on disarmament, and
almost nothing has been spent

tor research on detection syse I

tems.

The ultimate solution to the
China controversy is two Chic
nas, Eowles bulle\es, but
the present time neither
mosa nor Red China is willingt
to accept this. American policy;
should encourage both sides tot
move in the direction oi two
Cinnas, but iorinal recognition‘
of Red China is not the way toi
do it.
