gram as we know it from this
year. Although the prepping
piograni had some drawbacks,
the orientation program was a,
llop according to most ot’ the
vice-presidents. However, it
should be mentioned that some
feel that the program will assert
itscli over the years and evcnc
ually u-ill come to the point
where it will attain the set
goals.
Needllzss to say, no single pro-
gram has ever been found which
satisfies the above goals pcr7
icctly. This is due largely to
the variations oi situations in
each hall. It. is for this reason
that we woul advocate placing
the responsib ity for orienting
the freshmen, by use of prcp-
ping or other moans, on the
house council of each individual
hall. >
We would recommend the
use of l: point system, com-
pulsory attendance at house-
mectlngs, personal duties,
stunts at housemeeLings and,
if necessary, swafs,
or course, it is understood
that these recommendations are.
only general and would not‘
necessarily apply to each men’s
hall. Also, any activities which
.would violently abuse the new
students, physically or mentally,[
would be subject to curtai
ment by the Coil-1P. The details‘
at the program would he work-
ed out by the hall president and
vice-president. ,
We would like to see the fa<
culty hall advisers brought into
this to actually work with the
house council in deciding and
promoting the program. i
in any event, whether prep-
ping is or is not revived, the
vice-presidents feel whole-
heanedly that some .type oi
dciinitc program is necessary to
replace this lackadaisical means
oi introducing the incoming
freshmen to Grinnell college
and the men's residences.

An Open Letter to the Dean oi
Woincn:
Dear Miss Gardner,

Wednesday night our hall was
about to go to south campus tor
a serenade for one at our hall
bipthers, when we received thci
news that the loggia would not
be unlocked to allow the girl,
to come out as has been the'
custom.

We also learned that in the
past, when the loggia was be- .
ing unlocked tor a brief 15
minutes, the night watchman
was disobeying orders and at
the moment was in danger oi i
losing his job it he did it a» ',
gain.

Whether it was tiue about the;
i know no
know that the
shocked,
ielt a terrible disappointment
for our hall brother and ter-
ribly insulted by such ncws
i have never heard any
stories of ANY hall abusing the
privilege oi having the loggia
unlocked ior a serenade at any
time. Not only having the log-
gia remain looked spoiled the
entire idea of a serenade, it
also reflects upon the integrityv
of the men of the hall and tor
that matter, tho integrity oi thei
men oi north campus

If it was u mere oversight,
and I'm sure that it was, than i
it is understandable and can
be overlooked as simply n l
misunderstanding oi what was
happening.‘

Howevei, it it was a dclibei—l

thn the auditing systcm
was iiist in duccd in 1935, it
had two basic iunctions F
it provided free banking ser-
vices to all student organiza-
tions. Second, it provided for
supci-vision and control oi stu—
dent organization iunds,

When the system was last
“modernized" 20 years ago, the
same two iuncticns were basic
to it. Today wc operate under
that same 20 year old systcin
even though conditions arc dc-
cidedly changed.

Through thesc years the sys<
tern has becomc increasingly
inadequate to provide the
iuuctions ior which it was in<
tended. it has deteriorated to
the point where it is now has»
ed primarily on custom and
tradition,

The situation existing today
is largely due to the tremendous
increase in the volume oi busi—
ness handled by the auditor.
Last year over 2300 checks wcre
‘signad by the auditor the a-
mount totaling $96 315. as Near.
‘ly soc deposits were accepted
totaling $86,963.39.

The result of this volume has
been to force the auditor to
devote the major
to bookkeeping. while the bank—
ing serviccs are still provided,
the auditor no longer is able
to devote suiiicicnt time to his
supervisory duties. This is where
the prcsent system fails,

The system proposed here
provides fax this supervision

system docs not it does so in
two ways First, the numelous
inertial jobs oi bookkecping ale
assigned to an assistant auditor.
This allows more time for the
auditor to carry on his mare
responsible duties as supervisor

planation and reasons could be
and should be expected in the

Rather than revise the exist-
