Bowen Says Campus Government

Should Consider

“Student government migh
become even more ettective
than it is it it were concerned
more largely with big problems
and not so much concerncdl
with minor issues. Students
otten mil to achieve the iir
iluence or which they are cap-
able simply because they do
not know their own strength."
Howétrd R. Bowen, presis
dent oi the college, made
these observations on student
government in a speech, “The
state or the College," in Her—
rick chapel this morning

“i see no reason why studentl
govcinnicnt might not be the
iectly involved in the study of
tho cuiriculum, building plalis,,
instructional methods, athletic
policy and thc budget" He also}
said that there should be in
student government “a social
action division concerned about
the relation of studcnts to the
problems ol our w I,"

As an example of this, Dr.
Bowen pointed to Harvard
where a group oi students
are now working actively to
secure repeal of the loyalty
ioath provisions in icderal stu—
dent loans."

Dr. Bowen in speaking about
student govcr,ninent indicated

that he would be in favor of.

Speaking about the social

president said that while
Grinllell is one at the most
liberal colleges in the country
on social rules, “We should

The platiorms presented by
the candidates are sound in
some respects. but a plattorrn is
not necessarily the deciding fac-
tor in a delegates thinking. A
revised handbook, a smaller
council. an investigation of pass
sihlc council revision, or an ac-
tive participation in national
issues will not sway the votes
this year.
