the semester break. As they be-
gin on the second half of their
seasons, here is a look at. the
Grinnell yearlings and the pro.
gress they have made in three
Sports—and what- lies ahead for
them.

BASKETBALL -

Grinnell’s freshman basketball
team will travel to Illinois next
weekend where they’ll meet
Monmouth Friday, Feb, 19, and

Listed on the first team at
present and tabbed as tentar
Live starters for next week-
end’s trip are . John Kisser
(5'3) and Chuck Fuller (Grl)
at forwards, Denny Ashy (8—3)
at: center and GarSmit-II (5-10)
and Guy Ashton (5-9) at
guards, ’

In last week’s victory over
Central on the Grinnell court,
Coach Richard Young namcd
Risser and Fuller for their out-
standing playialthough they did
not start in that contest. Risser
scored 15 points and pulled
down 10 rebounds, while Fuller
was a defensive standout and
managed to pop in a couple of
baskets. As a result, both have
earned starting berths.

Season-long leaders in the
scoring department have been
Smith, averaging 19.2 points a
game and being last week’s
leading scorer with 21, and
Asby, who has compiled a 15.7
points per gave average. Ashy,
Smith, Steve Shoemaker andv
Kent Rogelson head the List
of rehounders, averaging 11,
in, s and 7, nspectively, per
game.

Coach Young cited the team’s
rebounding and defense as ma-
jor improvements since the start
of the season. Filling out the re»
mainder of the freshman roster
are Tom Phillips, Chris Sprung,
Bob Chubrich and Bill Depper-
man.

man wrestlers over the years
have had no high school exper—

for Peterson, but though his
squad is thin this year, he has
several good wrestlers.

Malnstays on this

team are Wayne Gano, a 157-
pounder, and Bill Montfort,
who wrestles 127 pounds.
Rounding out the roster are
Hm Glenn (130 lbs), Bob
Gwynne-Vaughn (137). Lowell

These freshmen wrestle for
the most part in exhibitions
against other freshmen during
varsity meets. Conference rules
allow each first year man only

The next competition for the
young grappleis will be the
AAU tournament at Iowa State
Teachers college Feb. 26 and 27.
Peterson plans to enter Gano

tion. ‘
