Galbraith says in “The Afflu-
ent Society" that Ioday's lack of

public expenditure as compared:

to that in the private sector
stems from the failure to change
economic thought as economies
mature. For example, thc great
increase in automobile produc-
tion (private expenditure) re
quires more and better roads
(public expenditure),

Galbraith expands this balance
theory. In one chapter he says
that televtsion, movies, cars and

all other distractions for today'st

youth that the private economy
has concocted means that Schools
must be made more appealing
in order to gain the attention of
young people. ‘

According to Galbraith, in the
private sector ot our economy
advertisers create more and more
urge to buy fewer and fewer ime
portant things. He Writes that in
contrast. to this, ”We exploit but
ploit but poorly the opportunity
summarizes, while we are
“starved" for public services and
along the dimension ot public
services." We are stuffed with
private services and made to feel
obligated to gobble up more, he
told to apologize if We seek to
satisfy our hunger.

Under the existing economic
establishment, the Harvard au-
thor feels that individual securi-
ty and national stability are de—
pendent upon full production. ”A
high level of economic security
is essential for maximum pro-
duction. And a high level of
production is indispensable for
e c o n o mic security," Galbraith
says in regard to our present
situation

So far, this doctrine is cone
‘gruent with that of any liberal.
The ditterence emerges when

about the size of the national

he is bothered ov the private

braith says in "The Artluent So-
ciety." Galbraith writes that
“as we expand debt in the pro-
cess of want creation. we come
necessarily to depend on this
expansion." i

His solution is to ll‘ansfel‘

kinds or private goods and
services that are produced"

The sizc of the gross national
product is not. contraryto popus
lar belier, indicative or the state
of the economy. Galbraith says.
The reason: GNP equates benes
riciar production with the pro—
duction of luxuries and useless
articles.

Americans have lulled them-
selves into thinking that a high
level of production assures mi1i~
tary security Galbraith gives two
ireasons why this is talse.

l The first is that once people

;have_ they regard these as things
which “are essential and, eannotl
