This very year there were

to make several times when
was being interviewed ior par
cars and magazines. .,

, But ior two at those men
there are hundreds oi hull”

“take in" and see only_super—
tieinlly. This is not so with
the Russians and Chinese.

. My conclusions on

jecl. are that since Russians and

Chinese do not circulate frec-

.ly abroad and only experts in

‘various fields are allowed to

go to ior-eign countries, neces-

sarily they make a better ini-
prcssion as a whole than we do.
