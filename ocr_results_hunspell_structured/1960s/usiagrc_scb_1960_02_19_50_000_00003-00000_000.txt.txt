relevant facts.

First, it is evident that the

past program, although ob-
viously not exactly what the
student body wanted, was fa-
vorably received. Further, it
was taken advantage of by a
number of couples on almost
every weekend without any
of the problems which some
or the prudish pessimistic de»
lenders oi the best of all pos-‘
sible status Iluos predicted,
eg. inconvenience to non-par-
ticipants, noise, drunkenness,
sin, immorality (whatever they
are) and pregnancy.
. In addition4ven though most
of us really believed the atom—
mentioned problems would not
arise—the first semester cxper-
imental pcriod did accomplish
going slow for the sake of going
slow, thereby not alienating
“friends of Grinnell.”

These are the revered peo-
ple, who because of their high
incomes (or father's high in-
comes) are able to influence
greatly social policies of Grin—
nell, even though these influ-
ences may conflict with the

- wishes oi the students.

Hence, it would seem, there is
no reason not to implement a
modest program~Saturday night
open dorms once a month, for
acamplkwhich obviously meets
the demands of almost all Grin-
nell studenfs. Not to expand the

’present strange and largely use-

less Sunday afternoon program
could only be construed by the
student body as an indication
that the dissenters do not think
,that young adults from 13 to 21
are capable of displaying social
judgment without chaperones.

ples of those objections. How-
’ ever, Li you have read or ever
do read (the “Rebellion,” you
need no help in ﬁnding Ihem
, for yourself.’

The supporters oi the maga—‘

*zine (of whom there 'may be
more than I suppose) might Say
that all the points above are not
valid objections at all but that I
simply do not understand at
what the “Rebellion” is driving.
Well, this may be true. Per-

7 haps the literature is too
adopt, the humor too subtle,
the nature or the criticism too

far above my capacitiw of un- ,

derstanding.
The Supporters might say that
I am too steeped in convention-

~ahsm to appreciate the real im-

port of the publication. They
might even say that the “Re-
bellion" is good because it is so
bad (a typical paradox for its
publishers).

Be that as it may—l must still
maintain that there is something
very “defunct" about the whole
business

said in reference to economic
,piogress “We should have a
‘balaliced budget with at least
one percent of the debt paid
‘each year. The president should
call the leaders of business,

“recommendations for dealing

lined a three-part program
which he favors.
l “First, he said, “We should
continue our Point nour pro-
gram. This program makes
sense, and it should be step-
} ped up. Second, we should ex-
port more oi our American
ideas abroad."

A third policy suggested was
an increase in the number of
exchange students between the
United States and other coun~
tries Schwengcl said that by
seeing the United States, many
foreign students would take
home new ideas about the coun-
try which would help to fight
