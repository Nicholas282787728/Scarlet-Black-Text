Don't Forget Grinnell

We View with. concern the emphasis which the Stue
dent council is placing on non-local issues at the expense
. . i

of campus situations and problems

 

The problem ii“ the South is important. But, judging
from the lack of student response, the Student council
is not justified in devoting the greater part of meetings
to‘the matter.

The committee dealing with the dormitory question
‘is all but inactive. There has been, no action taken con<
coming an honor system at Gl‘innell. We would still look
witll favor at any attempts to reorganize, for efficiency‘s
sake, the Central committee.

, i

It has been. stated by a Student council officer thatt
the council is capable or handling nlore than one issue at?
one time. .We Share this belief: l

o 1' ‘
India s New Party
India’s recently formed Swatnntro party is supposed-,

1y opposed to the “policy of nonalignment" or neutrality:
{followed by Nehru'S' Congress party. i,

liidio's Rajagopalachari, who formed the-new 1mrty,i
was quoted by a British newspaper as shying, “We must
give up our isolation. The west can help uS only it" we come
to 2i good understanding with the, rest of the South andi
southeast Asian countries . . .

“The policy of nonalignmellt was good and paid divi-l
(lends. . . i But when China committed agg'ession and cone
tinlles to‘trespass on a good chunli of our territory, main»
tains the dispute with us, and has completely destroyed
the confidence of the border states in India by their dis
play of power against us, the old policy is no longer a
good one.” ' ' .

All of thi sounds Very good, (perhaps especially so in
ii British newspaper). But there are many complications.
In brief, the problem is this. if India, or any country in
her position, aligns herself with anybody, she is taking al
dangerous step into a “camp” which, considering her mill:
tary weakness, could prove more disastrous than neutral?

‘ Kennedy Iii West Virginia

Although Kennedy won the primary ill Wisconsin, the
coming; May 10 West Virg'lin contest will be much more
of a test for the two leading- Democratic candidates

ollsin has a large Catholic vote. West Virginia‘
is reportedly 9707 Protestant. Some are of the opinion thnti
many of the coal miners will favor Humphrey. 1

According to Time magazine, a shop keeper in West,
Virginia said of Humphrey: “He’s more what the little
people, like me, want—somebody who can help us ollt 9t
this." "This” refers to the economic situation in West Vir—
gilliu which has resulted ill a per capitn income $500 be—
low the national average.

With these things seemingly iii Hlllil])lll'e)"s i"
there is also the chance that backers of Adlai Stevenson,
Stuart Symillgtoil and Lyndon Johnson will vote for
Humphrey ill an attempt to stop Kennedy. ‘

li' Humphréy wins in West Virginia. he will at least
still he, in the rac . it he loses, Kennedy will have a real
victory under his beltia victory which could very likely
