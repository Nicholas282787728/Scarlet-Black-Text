THE LIBERAL All COLLEGE

In the last issue belore the Scarlet‘
and black editors turn the paper overl
to the new management (or the ensu—
ingyeal', we find it has been customs
my CD review the activities of the
year in which the Scarlet and Black
has taken part, and to summarize the
things- for which the paper has stood.

As was stated in the lust
published by the i'eLiI'ing management,
the leading issue oi the year was to
he “Greater Grinnell,” and to this
theme the editors have fully subsoil!»
ed themselves ml‘oughout their enLiI’e
term of Office. Nothing was advor
cated or discussed in the editorial
columns but what was presented al—
ways with the thought of “Gleater
Gl'ilmell” in mind.

It has sometimes been asked just
what this platlorm includes, II.
should be said Lhzhl. it includes every
phase or the college, from the cui‘i‘icuj
lum side to questions involving extra
campus activities. \

Building spirit and organization oi
tho dormitory group according to inc

place or any general administrative
council or all buildings. Uplicrclnss
man rule and influence was set lorth
as the most workable iorm of dormi—

started, and the organization .01 a
Man's senate with any grcatci- powers

they saw lit, and thereby build up (lis—

The buildings were seen as the

As a step towards making this a
more permanent and ﬁrmly grounded
feeling, it was proposed that the elec-
tive system, with doiinitc arrange—

it was thought that this would make
it easier to start the individual

also been deemed one of the impor—
tant steps that should be taken. In'
this regard it should be said that it is ‘
for the protocuon of the meaning or.
- the Grinnell degree that these steps
should be taken. A degree from Grin- ‘
nell should, and does now, stand for
as much work and as good an cdu
cation in liberal arts as it is posSiblcf

to gel, and any lowering of l'equile
ments, or laxness in letting those un
able to keep up stay in school, is"
dangerous to the reputation of the
college. Tile institution must protcct'

Many internal questions have also
been brought before the students.‘
The Scarlet and black has seen it as'
its mission and duty to be both a.)

expression or general campus opln-'

unlns strictly to campus subjects, and
has shared to treat all campus duos
tions as it salv'lhcni, and to arouse

discussion on topics which seemed‘
vloal to student lilo.

Perhaps the most important thing
to come liclorc the general studcnli

Dear Sir:

I have iioticod with much inter-cs:
the discussions iii your paper regard
iiig the cheating in examinations and
the use or the honor system to prevent
cheating. It might be or some inter-
est to your readers if 1 should Lle-
sci-ibc the system used at Yale, wlioro
I attended aitcr leavyiig Grinncll scmc
years ago.

At Yale. cheating is made very dan-
gerous by a number of monitors who
walk up and down the aisles during
examinations, and who bave a num»
ber oi signals to call the attention oi
one another to various parts ol the
room when attention there is needed.
They arc supplemented by the pro—
lessors and assistants oi the departs
most who check the mm at the be—
ginning cl the hour to see that the
persons in their sections are all there,
and to nialro sure that the person is
actually writing his own examination,
instead or a tutor whom be has hired
to go iil his place. .
Tlle monitors and prolcssors are in
(act a bunch of policemen, and every
man is a suspect. say what you want
to, the man who graduates [rum that
college has at least written his exam-
inations by hiiuselh in daily quizzes

This plan of policing things is li-oiii
