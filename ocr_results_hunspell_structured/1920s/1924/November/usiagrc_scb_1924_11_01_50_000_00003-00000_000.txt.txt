It is not oiten that two iootbaii
learns iaco midi other, each minus its
captain, but that is the case today.
Makeover, Coc's leader, is barred he-
must: this is his ionrth year or colleg-
iutc iootball. whle Captain Ci'itcli'eu
of the Planters is out or the game on
account or injuries.

Grinnell has surely had her share or
'miurics. Winter is in the hospital,
ci-itchett is not able to be in uniform,
and Duke, Meeter and Wood are not
in the best or condition.

It is expected that Kingery will start
at leit hair as Critchett is not to he in
uhitorrn, and hieeter will probably not
be used unless he is needed.

 

l

Taylor has been anxious to get back
in the lineup, and he will probably get
his chance today in winter's place at
leit end.

in case Duke canTt start, Howarlh,
who has been shiited irom the leit to
the right side at the line, and has been
doing better than he has done all sea
son, will probably be at right tackle.

It is interesting to note that at rail
freshman track meet at Drake recent,

Simpson of Perry, who was registered
here this tall, but who was induced to

lliinnesota's new stadium will be
dedicated November 15. the day or the
Minnesota-Illinois game. This game
marks a rrsnmption oi play between
these two teams after a lapse of sev-
eral ycilrs.

Ainong the members of the Haskell
Indlan squad that played Creighton at
Omaha last Saturday, there are many
whose names are diiterent to say the
least; tor example, "Kicleis-wife,"
"Red Blanket," “Charging Skunk,"
“Little Boy." “Big Bone," ”Moonshine,"
"Takethergun? "Sleeping Bull,"
"F‘ireastarier," “Nu Smoke," and “Two'
Hatchets.”

As a reminder to his backfield,
Coach Hyland has painted the word

"Bull Montann’ 3" football pants. With
such a sign, Moran, Sweet and King-
ery ought to run the (Joe team ragged.

sueedball libs been growing in savor1 .

at Grinnell this year.. The game isn't
a bad one to watch when two last
teams are playing, and it has been
suggested that the nibble hall team',
the most probable champions oi the
inlerdor-ru series. play a picked team
iron the rest of the college as an add-
ed attraction at Homecoming,‘

The mind reader at the Culimlnl’s
magic show the past week prophesied
that the Pioneers would beat,Coe to~
day. Ii they do as we all expect them
to, Grinnell people will believe in mind '
reading for some time to come.

The custom of playing Cce on a
muddy iield or in the rain which was
violated last year seems to be back in
vogue this season and the team will
probably take their mud cleats along.
' ' -

Nobody else seems to have much of
a chance to play right halfback on the
aggregation operated by Hyland and
Black. Meredith Sweet, the star or last
year's team, has been playing such a,
consistent same that competitors are
discouraged, and he never gets laid,
out.

There is another open date nexti
week. Let us pray that so many ot‘
the team do not get laid out in scrlm»,
mage as in the last two weeks.
