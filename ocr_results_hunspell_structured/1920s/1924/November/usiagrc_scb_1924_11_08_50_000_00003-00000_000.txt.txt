counted for the 5-2 score at half time.
Throughout the second hall Cliu‘k re- ,

host that Building Three could do was
to garner 2 points on another pass by
c. Peterson. w. Patton and Quinby or
Clark, and C. Peterson and Unger of
Building Three played the Stellar rule:

been working out at quarter. AS a
