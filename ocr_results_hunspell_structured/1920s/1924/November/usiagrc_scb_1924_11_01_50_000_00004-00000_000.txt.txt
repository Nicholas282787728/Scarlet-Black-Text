fer-son and chtts, dwelt at some
length on the personal liberty angle
of the question, and apologized for-
any “pucrile babblings" which he
might display, since- one of the Grin-
nell papers, he said, had published the
date of his birth as March. 1922.

Emphasize Mnill Issues

James Work acknowledged the
“frothy effer-vcscence of these true
English spirits," but asked that the
main issues of the debate should not
be “thrust aside with a gesture and a
joke." He then explained that the
illustrious lnen cited by the affirma-
tive were not great because they were
drinkers, but in spite of that fact, He
mainhiiued that local option, educa.
tion and licensed sale of licouors were
all very well but that they all led
eventually to prohibition, the only
satisfactory solution.

Malcolm MacDonald, son of the El"

ing main speech for the filfirmative in
which he declared that many leading
doctors in England believed in the use
of alcohol as a stimulant, and had
recommended its use to Prime Minis.

Thornton Furllisltt-s Climax

John Thornton, as the concluding
speaker for the Grinncll team, replied
by telling something of his psrsonnl
knnwlstlge of London and Liverpool
degrcdatioo and poverty which he al—

ect result of the English system of
licehs‘d saloons. ,His speech was
marked by an intensely human appeal
which gave a certain sense of solidar-

“POMEY,

The four long weeks have finally
passed;
The tryouter's pen has scratched iLl

And he is glad.
Tedious, too, has been this tell,
0ft carried on by midnight oil.

Eight issues of the S. and B.
He's scanned With careful scrutiny

And seldom did his hope come true
Of seeing "his" Work appear in plain
View.

But he is glad.
He has forfeited many a. date,
And to his classes he’s been late.
His work in now in the hands of fate;
Oh staff, do be considerate—

Aild keep him glad!

inasmuch as the losers in both in-

Since Tuesday, Building Three has
advanced to second place over- Smith

h'iis not changed, Dibble, undefeated
to date, looms up as the probable win—
