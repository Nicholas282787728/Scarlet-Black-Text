Local Talent Scores
Success in “Kathleen

The musical comedy, "Kathleen,"

' presented by the John B. Rogers Pro—
duction campany, under the auspices
of the Social Service Lehgne, and un-
der the personal direction of Larry M.
Knowles, was given last night in the
high school auditorium. The romance.
made up entirely or local talent, was
an unusual success, and will be re
peated tonight

Alarge number of college students
participated in the showing or the
musical. The role of Kathleen, play-
éd by Doris Vlrclen, and that of Jim—
mie Stanton, taken by John hlberson
were greatly responsible for the suc—

,oess ot the showing, while Muriel
Retclirte was exceptionally good in
the part of Flossie Neverset.

The "Every hood is the Right Road"
chorus consisted wholly of college stu—
‘dents, while high schoo‘l.snd grade
school pupils tor-med the personnel or
vorious other groups. The "Dance—
O-Mnnia." chorus, 3.150 was made up
of college women and seemed most
Wpular. .

The entire production, was excel»
tionally well presented by local talent,
and showed the marks or excellent
directing.
