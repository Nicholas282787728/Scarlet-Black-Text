again going through heavy daily drill.
Tackling practice and scrimmage
against the Fresh are on the program
every afternoon and the coaches are
devoting every bit of energy to polish-

‘ing the Pioneer defense against the
brilliant Amels attack.

Special attention is being given to
the problems of correcting the Ames
terial attack. The brilliant passing
of Roberts has been an important
motor in all of the Iowa. State con-

Kansas Aggie eleven,

punting in the Coe game very nearly
proved disastrous in the last quarter

to develop a. reliable kicker. Moran,

attention and Schal‘nweber, Who did a.

the season. Cripnell, however, has a
two weeks’ rest While the Cyclones
play Minnesuta today and the results
of that game will give the Criancll
fans a line on the sctyal strength of
the Ames team. It is rumored that the
Iowa State tcam will not send their
ﬁrst team and best plays against the
Gophers, but hold them in reserve for
the conference games with Griunell
and Drake, which they deem more im-
portant.

AtEention of West
To Be Centered 0n
Co-eds’ New Plan

“Ci-lunch will be the center of at-
traction for all colleges in the middle
west while she is working out her new
federation plan for girls’ social life,"
was the general verdict of one of the
departments of the State Teachers Con-
vcntion held in Des Moines this week.

The new plan was presented by Miss
Redd at a roundrtable for deans of
women and administrative women of
all universities, colleges and high
schools in low,

"It became the subject of much one
thusiastic discussion," declares Miss
Read.

“To sum it all up,” she says, "the
deans assured me that. in forming the
plan, Grinncll is again proving herself
a pioneer; that, if she works it out
successrully, she will have taken one
of the biggest forward steps in demo.
cratic social life for colleges thaoihas
been WiLnessed in this generation." '

“YOU AND I” REPIGTEA
”RISING GENERATION”

All Leads inJiomeoonling Play Will
Be Taken By Actors Already
Popular With GrinnelL

The cost which presents the Home—
coming play is composed of several
players well known to Dramatic Club
audiences and in addition some who
have not appeared formerly at the Car
louial. The leading feminine role is to
be taken by Katherine Gilmore, long
Ia iavoritc with Grinnell ‘oudiences,
Miss Gilmore plays opposite Emil Eil-
harz who appeared in both of the Dm~
matic Club productions last year.

The juvenile roles are to be taken
by Agnes Birdsall and Robert Berry.
Both Miss liirdsall and Mr. Barry app
neared in the freshman play last year
and gave excellent performances. Eer-
nard Craven, well known on the cam-
pus for his comic characterizations.
will essay a serious role, that of an
itinerant novelist. Winifred Parker,
one of the ﬁnest ingennes the Dram~
atic Club has ever had, will have the
uproariously funny role of Etta, mid,
model and social climber. Ralph Hall,
remembered for his appearances in
the Freshman farce two years ago and
in “Beyond the Horizon,” last year,
will impersonate a pompous business
man. V

A’ Play About “People"

"You and I” is a play about people
just like ourselves. It is rapid in
movement, laughable and thoroughly
diverting. Professor George Baker OI
Harvard has characterized it as a play
for man, and many men in the Home-
coming audience will no doubt ﬁnd

uation set forth in the Barry I)!

"You and I” gives a fascinating pies
ture of the "new generation." In ii.
there is at proposal scene that would
send Beau Bruimnel into tears. In the
second act there is the Bohemian at-
mosphere of an artist's Studio which
serves as a. background for the antics
of Etta, the model, At this point Lhe
may becomes screamingly funny.

In presenting "You and I” the Dray
inatlc Club is trying to give Grinneil
one of the finest American plays of re-'
cent years, with appropriate settings
and costumes. Under the direction of
Mrs. Hallie Flanagan there is every
reason to expect a. noteworthy and ur-
tistic production.

TALK [1N SHAKESPEARE

Frodcn'ck Wardc, prior Fifty yours on
Stags, Will Lcctm hora-nous
Yersonihliﬁes.

Frederick Warde, who appears here
next Tuesday night as a part of the
college lecture course, comes to
Crinnell utter fifty years as an actor
of classic roles on the British and
American slogd -

The last few years have seen a do:
cidcd revival of interest
speareau plays, resulting in several
spectacular successes on Broadway,
such as Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters in

more in “Hamlet." Mr. Words has
played an important part in the move-
ment, and has recently been devoting
part of his time to the lecture plat
form, He speaks in Herrick chapel
Tuesday evening on "The Actors of
Shakespeare from hurbagc to Booth."

Modern Shakespeare enthusiasts are
particularly interested in the great ac—
tors of the post—Bettcrton, Garrick,
Siddons, Kcmble, Kenn, Mscready—
ind in how they interpreted the great—
est of all dramatic literature. Grimm]!
is indebted to the lecture course com-
mittee for the privilege of hearing a
man who has numbered among his
contemporaries and associates such
historic personages as Sir Henry Irv-
ing, Charlotte Cushmdn, Adelaide Neil-
son, Lawrence Barrett, and Edwin
Booth.

th-. Warde has made so especial
study of the traditions of acting
Shakespeare—not only those of his
own time but of the older school; and
half a century as an actor gives him
an unusually rich background from
which to draw, as a lecturer. ’
