ly approved the plan for a Grinnell
College Chest discussed editorially in
the Scarlet and Black last spring. It
seemed that both time and money
Could be’saved by merging all the var-
ious efforts to secure donations from
the students and faculty. These three
organizations have accordingly ape
pointed the undersigned as a commit-
tee to formulate plans for the pro-
posed campaign.

“We believe that every College ac—
tivity or student organization which
solicits Contributions on the campus
should share in this campaign. It
will be possible then, to promise that
there will be no other solicitations for
money during this academic year.

“In order that the plans for this
united campaign may be made by n
committee adequately representing
the campus causcs dependent upon
student contribution. we invite rep-
resentatives of all other interested or-
ganizations to communicae at Once

importance of mutual regard and co- .

President Mnin went on to compare
a college with a. "thinking shop."
”Speaking of the chapel service he
characterized it as “the soul of the
college, the place where we feel the
heartbeat of the institution." In his
concluding remarks the President left
a challenge: ”Shall we be worthy of
our inheritance—the Grinnell spirit?
