The Glee club wins. Let congratula-
’tians be unrestrained.

It has conclusively proved that its
slogan ”The Best in the West”, is the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth. Its Chicago victory has
given Grinnell a position in the mills—
ical world that corresponds to the
championship oi the Big Ten and the
Missouri Valley in the‘ athletic world.

Is our judgment is correct, the Glee.
club members owe their success to‘
their regular and frequent practices.
to lhei faithful attendance, to their
persistent (lo-operation under the,
leadership of their director. Or in
Illnple Anglo-Saxon, to Work.

gently directed work, and that goes
for every form of campus activity, for

note only a. carelessness of interest

The Hin ge-Cap is the insignia of Williams

Shaving Cream and of Williams only.

You’ll notice three things about Williams

every time you shave, 1. Williams lather

is heavier and holds the moisture in against

the beard. Quicker and more thorough

softening takes place. 1‘ Wi hams lather lubri-

ﬁates your skin -— your razor actually seems to

glide" the hairs oil. 3. Williams lather leaves

the skin in marvélnusly ﬁne condition. No matter

how frequently you shave, your face stays cool,
smooth and comfortable.

You’ll enjoy every shave with Williams. It is
a pure, natural-white cream without any artiﬁcial
coloring whatsoever.
