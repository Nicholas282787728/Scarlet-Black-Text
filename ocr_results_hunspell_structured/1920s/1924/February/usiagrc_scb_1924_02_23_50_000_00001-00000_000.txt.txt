The biggest thing that has ever hupr
pencd to a Grinnell organization is
happening right now in tho sending
to New York of the Grinnell Glee club
to compete with the college and uni.
versities of New England.

The program given above for the

planned to appeal to a great diversity
of pocketbooks. The slogan of H. W.
Matlack, promotervinrchiet, is “One

defending the reputation of the rest or

Old, moss-covered Eastern colleges. It
will be Grinnell vs, role, Harvard,
Dartmouth, Princeton, Amherst, and
so on. It will he David vs. Goliath all
over again. The twenty—four men who
are on this year's glee club are won-
derfully fortunate, but they have an
enormous responsibility ahead of
them.

Fine Reports itcceivod

Reports of persons, disinterested
and otherwise, who heard the proceed-
ings in Chicago last Monday night all
corroborate the decision at the judges.
One ol these latter was heard to re-
mark to his associate “That's by far
the best We have heard," and another,
speaking of the prize song, said "this
is the first song that has really sung
that number.“ Edward Moore, of the
Chicago Tribune, himself one of the
judges, said that the prize song was a

“The student of colonial histow is

Religion oi l’ullljc bt-rvicc

The second aspect oi )Vashington'sl
life, according to 111- Katcliite, was
his conception of public service, which
‘was almost a religion with him.

”We need to reestablish th1s relig-
iiius concephon oi our public 1' ‘9," he
asserted. ‘ {oriunatly we are under
.1 different domi ion. Private inter-
ests const1ict our new or public ser-
vice. Distress and crcn despair over
public his is prevalent in all civilized
nations. Contempt for public olr1cc
scars the l1fc of the state. Democracy
can only sur1ivc as we attain a high
concephon of public duty.”

11. Ratclil’fe advocated a more uni-
versal acceptance or the English es-
teem for pubnc life. The Brit 11 youth
oi promise is encouraged hy’all moans
possible to enter parliament or some
other branch ol government. He is
taught that service or the state is the
highest tom of human service.

Washington A Pivotal Character

“It is strange," he continued. “That
a man of the old order, as Washington
1v s, should play such a part in estab-
lishing a new order. The same thing

Within a. lifetime, ilc prophesied, the

United States will have more White
people then have cver bccn within the
bounds oi oncgovcrnmnt. Never has
there been a greater destiny, never a
more inspiring outlook, never an out—l
look to make one more serious. What,
was true of Washington with refer-‘1
ence to his little field, he pointed out,
is true of the United States on an
enormously greatcr scale.

George Washington would never have

society in 1924 is one of adapting itselr,

He closed his address with a tribute
to Washington from the works of

Gives Interesting Account of Trip
Through Holy Land.

In one of the in ‘t interesting talks
before the Y 11'. C, A. this year, Miss
Clemewell Lay, instructor in English,
gave a low glimpscs of Palestine, at
the meeting l1cld last Thursday cve—
niug. A hiiei account of a. trip to the
Holy Land included dcscriptions of
many of the places famuus in ancient
and modern history.

’ ‘he parly 0! which Lay was it mem-
ber landed at the {animus little city or
Acre, and went overland by carriage
to Nazareth. “Nazareth,” said Miss
Lay, “is a most friendly and p1c-
turesqne village, but some of the poet—
i'y is lost when one sees a stately na—
tive Woman going to the well for water
with a standard on can on her head."

Damascus, the next stop, was then
in the hands of the French army of
occupation. Its bazaar had been
burned and not as much was lelt of
its ancient beauty.

Jerusalem, the city of flat roots, was
the principal destination or the party.
Many interesting trips to historic log
calities such as the Dead Sea, Jericho,
and Bethlehem. An evening trip to
the Mount oi Olives was one or her
finest cxpericncos, said Miss Lay.

Preceding Miss Lay's talk, Ruth
Somcrs played Grieg’s "To Spring."
