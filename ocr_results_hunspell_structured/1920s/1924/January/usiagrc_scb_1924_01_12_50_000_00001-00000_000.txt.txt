Scholarly Lecturer Heludes His
Subject With a. Discussion
Of Classic Spirit

DIFFERENTIATES MODERN
AND CONTEMT’ORARY 'ART

Uses Slides To Prove That The
Classic Spirit Persists
In other Schools ’

Speaking before a good sized crowd
in Herlick Chapel last night, Walter
Pacll of the Metropolitan museum of
New York endeavored to’huild up a
bond between past and present art in
a. lecture entitled “The Classis Ele-
ments in Modern Art.” llr. Pach was
introduced by Miss Caroline Sheldon,
head of the French department.

The first part oi the lecture of Mr.
Pach was devoted to a discussion of
the classic spirit in general and- a
definition of classic art in contrast to
classics. it was asserted that the
classic element is very often the cri-
terion by which most pictures are jud-
gen and that a study or modern art is
usually a study of these classic ele—
ments under new forms as they are
expressed by succeeding schools. In
this sense, it was shown that we may
derive pleasure from a modern picture
by seeing its classic spirit of the past
and also its elements which make it
an expression of the present.

Defilliw Terms

The speaker then explained what he
meant by modern art, stating that it
is the creative and significant art of
today, in contrast to contemporary art
which is all that is being produced at
the present time, thus including both
good and had.-

Another definition of art terms was
illny'ie between the. classic in art and
the romantic. It was liomterl out
that the classic is that form in which
all men share, something which hits
to do With things outside the individu-
al or any particular race. The ro-
niantic on the other hand deals with
human experience, the adventure of
living. - ‘

“But," declared Mr. Finch, “it is to
the Classic that We always letlirn.”
Taking this statement {is it key for the
last part of his lecture, the speaker
than attempted to Show by slilles how
the classic elements. beginning with
the time of Greece have been evidenc—
ed in almost every school, no matter
how’cxtremc, down to the present day.
Even the cuhists who are the extreme
of the logical spirit have felt the in-
fluence of this old and binding spire

A stranger in the city looked on in

amazement at the scene before him.
was this an evening cal-d party or
flying field? Was he mistaken in think»
ing he had come here to enjoy the
theatre program? For down in the
rows of seats the supposed audience
was bending eagerly ovcr numerous
card games or more playful ones mak-
ing toy airplanes to amuse the spectu~
tors several expensive feet below,
We should not be expected to know
that the business of "rushing the ml-
lery" has become almost an institution
in our midst and is an inevitable part
of the career of every well—educated
collogian. For weeks at a time the
“upper balcony" may remain unoccu-
picd, bllt on the event of some special
attraction when the necessary fee
goes rather far to the left of the dec-
imal point, its popularity increases
and its steps are worn by the rush of
oncoming spectators who have chose
on to save their money and give it to
the Russian Relief.

Of course, we do not mean to in—
fer that this is the only reason for

 

Rushing the Coop Established

of seats. The higher, healthier al»
titude, the exercise in climbing the
stairs, the seeing

most of their friends, and the great

oppurtunities of

enjoyment in games, knitting, reading
or social conversation to while away
the two or three hours of waiting of-
fer inducements to many of the throng.

Soon after dinner of the particular
evening the walk before the theatre
door begins to be crowded with car-
lv arrivals and at the opening of the
door some hours later, the mob rushes
madly past the ticket window and up
the stairs not heading hair nets torn
or collars pushed awry in the scram-
blc. They dash down the steps of the
balcony and are soon settled at their
various sports with such a hubhuh that
a boiler factory would seem like a hos-
pital zone.

Some individuals may get through
college without this delightful e
pericnce, yet there would surely be a
mis pg link in their education and we
think but pardon us—we will have
to hurry down to the theatre in order

 

the choices of this particular location

to gel. ill line.

ELEVEN IIIIIAGE AIIIEG
GGUHTWGINNEII

Although out of Practice Scrim-
mage, Benz and Boge are
Doped To Start.

Coach iiacnachrcn and a squad of
11 1100p artists left this morning for
nmos where Grinnell is scheduled to
meet the Cyclones in the third valley
cage contest of the season The uien
who tour the trip were apt. Benz,
Critchctt, Gelvm, Wintel H. Boge.
Cushmztn, Prelim, Wing, Stock, Duke
and Stotts.

The man have been practising hard
this week in preparation for the game
and should give a good account ac-
count of themselves tonight. The
battle with Missouri showed a number
of weaknesses in the Pioneer angers.
Passing and receiving the bflll were
the must important weaknesses and
the coaches have been emphasizing
these fundamentals in the workouts
this week.

Although winning the game with

,Missouri, it was not without cosi. for
same weakness that was evident in'

both Benz and Huge received iniui-les
which have kept them from scrimmage
the last few days. Benz is troubled
with a bad ankle While Bogs suffered
a broken nose in the encounter with
the Tigers. The injuries of both men
are coming nicely and both will, prob-
ably start the battle against the Cy-
clones. /

. Others in Good Condition
Gelvin and Winter at guards, and
Critohett at the other forward position
are in good condition and will be the
other men to open the Ames contest.
Cushman has been doing some good
work recently and will probably get
into the fray sometime during the
play. . .
The victory over issouri put the
Pioneers in a tie for third place in the
Valley with a percentage of ion. The
men went to Antes this morning with
the idea that their first invasion of
territory in the valley nust bc success
ful. Grinnell and Alnes have played
many close games on the basketball
court in thc lflst few years and a vic-
tory for the former will mean the de—
feat of an ancient rival and a better-
standing in the valley. ’

[his will be the last game until the
25th of Janum Consequently the
men will play without reserve 101' any
future contest.
