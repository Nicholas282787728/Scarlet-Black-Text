TALBOTT’S

CAMPUS OPINION

THE QUESTION.

Do you bclicvo that tho honor system
in exiuilllultiolls would do away
with cribbingi
THE ANSWERS.

)liss Luella J. Rem], .dean of wom-
en: If all students valued thiei' own
honor, yes, but 1 fear that all stud
cots do not value their own honor
proporly, and therefore there would be
little change.

ll. w iIntlaclf, dircctor of publicity
and assistant to the president in alums
ni relations: The experience of institur
tions which have tried the honor sys<
telni is that it has not (lone away with
cribbing.

Knﬂliry‘ll Ausliulll: Yes, I think it
would unller some professors. of
course, it would take some time for
such a system to be understood
and everyone would have to have a
personal sense oi honor.

Maulcy Jane f comprehensive c.»
aminations were to replace the ox-
aininations on details, there would be
no possibility ol cribbing. No honor
system could prevent crihhihg when
the examination is on details and facts.

Eleanor Grover; i believe that the
honor system in the class-room would
bc a help, more of a help than a hind-
l'ance‘. For this reason it ought to be
used.

Thompson Catllclirt: No! I do not
think that the honor system would do
away with cribbing. Those who now
crih would take further advantage of
the honor System.

Miss Chatterton ﬁrmly disclaims Nor-
wegian parentage. The date of the
occasion remains a mystery. Her
uneventful childhood and school life
in several small prairie towns culmi-
nated in a double graduation lrom
lhigh school, the second commencement
-occurring at a different school and
sewing only to incrcose her number
.of college entrance credits.
Her Grinncl‘l career was even as
yours and mine, or perhaps a little
‘mol'e so. During her four years’ resi-
dence she was at one time or another
a member of the League Board, the
w. A. A. Board, and Ellis Literary so—
ciety, as well as being house chairman
of Meal-s cottage in hcr senior year.
While in college, llliss Chattcrton as-
isisted Professor Payne with his his-
‘tory papers; and took over Professoré
Paul Peck's history classes when he
went to war.

Her actual teaching experience was
gained by instructing in history in the
high schools of Humboldt and Harlan.
Miss chattel-(on feels that high schuul
teaching does not compare With colr
less work.

In tho interval between her second-
any school pedagogical experience, and
her graduate study at Radcliiro, Miss
Chatterton made the summer trip
abroad with Ml: Peck's party, and
later wintcrcd in California.

In her less serious moments, she
reads, cooks (no sewing), and drives
a unique Eord which has never had
on accident.

Stuart Ball, cx-‘25, who is now at-
tending Northwestern university, was
the captain of the affirmative debat-
ing team, which recently won from
the Uhivcrsity'of Michigan by a 3 to a
