PAUL HARVEY ﬂPENS
SERIES ﬂF tEﬂlUHES

Discusses Trend of “New Journalism."
Its Growing Function of Inter.
puelnﬁon.

Speaking before a small audience,
Paul Harvey, noted journalistic schol-
ar, opened the year’s lecture course
Friday evening in Herrick Chapel with
a vivid and brilliant address on "The
New Journalism."

He opened his address with a dis—
cussion of advertising. Advertising
he maintained, is directed largely at
woman because of her daily promin-
ence in the home. As a result of
this we have the ascendenCy of the
evening press. The evening press,
containing the news of the day, be-
cause of the rapidity of make up must
consist chiefly of skeletonized and
tabloid news. it is condensed for
effect. Advertising is the main sup—
port and sustenance of the evening
press. This increase in the variety
of advertising has resulted
employment of large corps of adver-
tising specialists. He noted the large
increase in the use of pictures as it.
means of attracting stile attention of
customers who have potential buying
power but to Whom solid reading mat-
ter is unnttriictii'e and unintelligible.

Two ’i‘ppes of Journalism

The new journalism, Mr. Harvey
says, is divided into two distiller
groups, the first being exemplified by
papers such as the New York Daily
Times and The Christian Science
Monitor. Their substance appeals to
statesmen, scholars and eminent men.
it is its duty to cast different molds
upon public opinion. ’ '

The other type of the new journal-
isrrr is constituted by the popular
Dress, made up largely of the maga-
zine and the daily popular press. It
has a large potential value in that
it brings before the average reader
new views of the Ienlisms of life and
tends tcl direct his interest into the
channels of the higher journalism.
America leads in classical and popular
education but it is the duty of the
press to follow that up with new inr
terpr-etations of life. '

llir. Harvey concluded his talk with
a plea for the entrance of college men
and women or today into the fields of
the newer and higher journalism. Pub-
lishers and editors have no dilflculty
in securing writers who understand
finer writing, but it is difficult to ob-
tain those who comprehensibly can
grasp the greater significance of the
coming era. We must look forward to
the scholars of the rising generation
to motivate and perpetuate the new
and greater ideals of life thru the new
and higher journalism.

Cos and Grinnell meet at Cedar
Rapids next Saturday for their twen—
ty-first annual battle in what prom-
ises to be one of the best games in the
history of the two schools. The Pitr
neers have won eleven starts and the
Kohawks eight. while one game M-
sulted in a scoreless tie.

Coe has held Grinnell scoreless for
the last four years, while three is
the highest number of consecutive
wins that the Pioneers have register-
ed over the Cedar Rapids tearin- Coe
also holds the highest score, having a
record of beating Grinnell 35 to o in
1914, while the big score of the Scarlet
and Black came in 1917, when they
triumphed 48 to b. .

rby Boosts kohuwka

Since the coming of Moray Ehy as
mentor at the Presbyterian institu-
tion, the Kohawks have always had
one of the strongest teams in the
state, and this year seems to be no ex-
ception. Although losing the sea-
son's opener to Columbia college, they
have since beaten Dubudue University
by a large score, and pulled the re-
markable feat of tying the strong Wis-
consin University team, 7 to 7. Al-
though they are not in the Missouri
Valley conference, Coe has a team.
that would compare favorably with
the best in the valley, so a win for
Gl'innellwould be as good as a confer—
ence victory.

on account of the Wisconsin game.
close followers of the sport give Coe
the edge in the dope, and Grinuell sup-
uorters look to l-lyland and Black to
turn the trick of breaking the Kohawk
string of triumphs. From all reports
though, Coe has a well—drilled team
both in the line and backfield, and
it will be a harder team to defeat than
Drake.

Pioneers Look Better

The pionocr team has been pushed
hard during the past week, tackling,
blocking and scrimmages being on the
program almost every night, and the
team seems to be improving in every
branch of the game. The passing
game especially looks a lot better, and
the daily tackling drill against the
freshmen showing results in scrim-
mags.

The squad still has the injury hoo-
doo to contend with for Captain Cri -
chett was hurt Thursday. though it is
hoped that he will be sufficiently
recovered by next week 5nd. McClain
too, has been on the bench all week.
but it is fully expected that he will
he back in the lineup when the team
goes to Cedar Rapids. Wood and
Scharnweber are again in uniform,
but it is extremely doubtful that they
will be able to play Saturday.

A victory for the Pioneers in the
coming game is necessary to insure a
successful Homecoming, November 15.
and the eff‘crts of the squad and the
coaching staff are pointing to that
end.

Elli WATER SUPPLY
INAIJEUUATE FUR FIFiE

Plans in Pipe lVlItcr from Arbor Lillie
For Use in Cllsc of Fire, Now
Under Consideration.

The inadequacy of the water supply
in Grinnell which has been causing
considerable annoyance to both towns—
people and students, has reached the
point where the city is no longer amply
protected against fire. and plans are
being made by the anyor and city
officials to remedy the situation.

At present the city water is being
shut off from 10:30 p, in. until morning
in order to store up enough water to
last through the day, and the city of»
ficlals are convinced that a his fire
would soon exhaust the supply stored.
A planvto pipe the water from Arbor
Lake to he used for lire purposes has
been proposed and is now under in-
vestigation. This scheme would cost
the city about 53,000, but would greatly
reduce the inevitable loss in case of
ﬁre and would also cut down the insur-
ance rate on the buildings protected.

This plan is now under considera—
tion, and if the necessary funds can be
l'ztised, Will probably be put Lhmugh in
a short time.

The Grinnell debaters, James Work,
John Thornton, and John blccee,‘ who
will clash with Oxford, England, Wed
nesday evening, October 29, are busy
preparing a case with which to meet
the arguments of the Englishmen, who
will uphold the affirmative of the
question "Resolved: That this House
is opposed to the principle or prolllr
llilion.” The English viewpoint will
be presented by Mr. J. D. iVoortl-ufl.
Mr. Malcolm MacDonald and Mr. lll. C.

To Get English Viewpoint

vai the opinion of John McGee, presi—
dcut of the Debating Union of Grim
hell, and member oﬂ the team, this
will be an unusual opportunity for
Grinneil students to hear some of the
outstanding young men of Great Brits
sin. and to get the English viewpoint
on a question concerning which Eng
land and America differ very,radically.
The Speech department is curious that
all of the students take advantage of
the occasion and be out in large num-
bers to hear the question dismissed."

The English team has mapped out
quite an extensive itinerary in Amer-
ica and will meet some of the most
prominent universities and colleges in
the country on different questions. All
of the debates are decided by a stimd<
ing votd of the audience which prob—
ably accounts for the fact that they
are generally defeated,
