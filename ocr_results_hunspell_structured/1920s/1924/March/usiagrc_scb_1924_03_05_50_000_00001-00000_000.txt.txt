Uncanny Power of The Dramatic
Is Basis of Popularity for
O’Neill’s Play.

TALBOTT, THOMPSON, 'AND
STEINER IN THE LEADS

Arthur Fag'uy Cote Is Doing All,
' Excellent W'ork In the
Direction of Play,

Eugene O‘Neill, the author of "Beyv'
and The Horizon," uhich is to he
produced by the Dramatic club at the
Colonial, Saturday, larch 15, is Cl'edvl‘
ited, and rightly too, “itll an almost;
uncanny power of the dramatic. Al-
though his plays are built aroung very
simple themes, his colliiiiarld of know.
ledge of tlic stagc makes his dramas
fail , ex ale dramatic tones.

li‘hereas most play hts are satiSA
fled with a single climax, 0' eill liasi
hit rrpon several in each of his plays;
There are three climaxes ill “Beyonut
The nor on" and cacll contains morel
dramatic material than the average
play.

Professional actors who have taken
roles in O‘Neill's plays have found
themselves stars almost overnight
and their successes are attributed in
no small sense to the unusual quality
of his unusiral dramas. Richard Bel]-
nett‘, who took his first‘ leading role
in ”Beyond The Horizon" leapt to
stardom at once and since his ap-
pearance in that play has become
known as one of the leading _ actors
today. Pauline Lord has had prac-
tically the same experience following
her role as Anna, in "Anna Chr
and Charles Gilpin became a
as the Emperor ill “Emperor Joues."_

Only one O'Neill plav has been,
brought into the West, though 1lll~
doubtedly otllers will‘lle seen in this
section in the future.

"The Emperor Jones" played at
the Iowa Theatre in Des Moines last
year was acclaimed as one of the
best dramas ever seen there.

Under the capable direction of Al»
thur Faguy-Cote, the actors who are
to take part in the Dramatic clu‘o
production are going through strenu-
ous rehcrsals every day, and when the
curtain rises on "Beyond The Horizon"
Grinnell will see one of the best or-
ganized productions that has ever been
seen here.

gained by the Blue arid White cagers

hard to accomplish against the Crin-

“Chuck” Everett has proved to be
Solem's best bet, and has continued
to score consistently in every game,
