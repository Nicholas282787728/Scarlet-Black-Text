The Pioneer's mentor's choice dil-

re -s somewhat irom those chosen by

his, spoits w tors and coaches
in the iiissouri \alley r gioll, but his
backfield is the same \\Illl one excep-
tioii as that chosen by Ed (loeliranc.
sports editor of the Kansas c y Juur-
nillsl’o. , whose selections are often
termed the ol'llc' l ones for
league. The backticld quartet oi
.lleetor ol' Gllllllell, Cochraue ot the
K as dggics rr _ oil of Nebraska
and Chi . or issouri was the one
picked by near - erci-i expert and
needs no eulogy.

However, the second string quartet
comprising Pecry of the Oklahoma
Aggics, Everett of Drakc. Potts ot Ok-
lalioiiia and Howell or Nebraska
would look well on any team, and all
ol these men were mentioned on
either the first or second teams by
practically all others who home: ”all"

Three Fiouccrs are honored with
places on Duke's first team, a larger
number than was accorded the same
honor by any other authority, but all
three 1 e men who were mentioned
somewhere on the lists of each writer.
Niblo is again awarded an end pos
tion, .1lcetei- is in the backfield, and
Captain Martin, who played tackle all

For his other end position, Iiyland's
assistant chose Lindenmeycr of iris

chus, who, .with Coo. of Ames, was
placed on the second team.

Tombaugh, burly captain of the
Kﬂggics is Mai-tins running mate at
guard, and his selection as well as
that of Wallace of Oklahoma for ceir
tor, was made practically unanimously
by all coaches. The only other Flo-
iieer to be mentioned on either of
Duke‘s teams, was Dav-is, who was
placed at tackle on the second team

of the varsity squad, which will be
picked in the meantime, and all fresh:
men are eligible to compete. it is c.
pectcd that there will be unusually
last games this year because or the
fact that there is a large number or
men out for the varsity squad who
will necessarily be cut from tho final
squad.

Fresh prospects Good.

There is also a clever looking bunch
of lrosh cagcrs reporting for prac-
ties. They include Wilhelm, former
Rock Island, 111., high school star, De
Long, nice, McIllLlre, Leonard
Briggs, Lcidtlte, Sharnborg. and seve
at others who have shown up well in
early practice sessions.

The sophomores, who as last year's
ireshmen, copped the interclass
crown, are expected to make a strong
showing. They will be represented by
Scliroer, now ineligible for varsity
competition, and several other good
men, while the number will probably
be augmented when thc varsity squad
is picked.
Practice New Week.

AS many of the best eager-s oi the

places on the varsity it is difﬁcult to
make predictions concerning their
strength but they will undoubtedly be
represented by many good men.

graduation route, and are planning on
providing the Big Ten with some
classy football next fall.

Drake will play tIieG Grinncll's homo-
coming, Oct. 22. The isulldogs are reg-
ular opponents at Grinncll holnecoms

ing the Aules Cyclones at Ames next
