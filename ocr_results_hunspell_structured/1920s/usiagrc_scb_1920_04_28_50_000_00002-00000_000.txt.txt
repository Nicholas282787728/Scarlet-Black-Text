Do You Think

The Development of the
Men’s Lil'e in Grinnell is
vitally huporlnnt.

The Mice Are in the lJ‘lolLl'
Barrel.

One of the most pressing needs of
Grinnell ls the development of the
men’s his in the College. This is not

and has long been realized and pri-
ralely sought alter by those who have
seen the true needs of the college.
New 'buildihgs, more equipment,
higher salariestto professors are all
progressive steps which the college
administration must face in the near
future. None of these things, how—
ever, is as essential as the develop-
ment of what President Main has

the class room and has a major part
in directing him through the formative
years of his college course,

The ideal tor Grinnell as expressed
by President Main is that the college
be three colleges in one. It is to be a
college for men and a college for was

the colleges of the

In putting torward the development

of the men's hie of Gl'inuell it is not

'our purpose to belittle the importance
of the women's lile or to intimate that

it has yet reached that ﬁnal stage of

perfection in which it can be regarded

as a completed thing. The women's

life of Gl'iuuell is important and its

advancement cannot be neglected,

However, the development of the
men’s side of the house might seem to
be somewhat behind that of the wo-
men's in the organization of group
life.

This inequality of development is due
to very natural causes. For'one thing
the quadrangle was constructed sev-
eral years berore the dormitories.

The COlll‘Sﬁ 0f Gl‘illllell undergradu-
ate lite, While not, perhaps, reversed,
was greatly changed with the intro-_
duction of th‘e dormitory and quad-
Tangle systems. This concentration Of
student living quarters necessitated
radical changes in many phases at
student life. Since the quadrangle
was_built ﬁrst the women were able
to start the work of readjustment be-
fore the men were confronted with the
problem,

The Women were also far better able
to keep their life intact during the War
than were the men. A large percent—
age of the men left college to take 011
war service while those who were left
had those fragments of the normal life
Whichwel‘e left swept away before their
faces with the introduction of the S. A.

 

Grinnell and probably in most culr
leges and universities has not only
recovered from the effects or the revo-
lution caused by the war.

Add to these adverse circumstances
the demand for abnormal development
which is dust beginning to be felt
throughout the country and it will be
apparent why the problem of the (lee
vclopment of the lueu's life in Grillhell
is a vital issue at this time.

——.—6—
One or the ﬁrst essentials in putting

the "men's college" in its proper place
is to put them on a basis of at least
numerical equality with the women.
According to present registration ﬁg.
ures the women make up sixty percent
of the student body.

were more nearly equal.

According to statistics on chapel at:
tendance gathered by the Scarlet and
Black for the weclr ending Friday,
April 23, the daily average attendance
of men was 94, or 33 per cent or the
tom number of men in college, the
daily average attendance of women be-
ing 173 or 41) per cent or the total.

This makes the total average attend-
ance for both men and women 272
which shows that 37 per cent of the
student body is in the habit or attend-
ing chapel.

A true solution

when the combined student and tac-
ulty hodlcs make an earnest eilol-t
either to reconstruct the service if
such a thing is necessary or support
the service as it now stands.

We would Suggest that it Would help
to lock the A. R. H. and all other calli-
the
period. It is our guess that a count
of students in the Alumni Recitation
Hall from nine to nine-ﬁfteen would
show that the total topped the ﬁgure
for the chapel attendance. Certainly
the presence of a hallfull of loafers

of the chapel service. The closing of
the library was a step in the right di~
rection but what is the good of driving
the mice from the cupboard if they are

welcomed in the flour barrel?
