Bridgham' Begins
Frosh Band Drill

A freshman band of seventeen
pieces held tWO rehearsals this Week
under the direction of Prof. J. M.
Bridgham, who states that the band
is well balanced and contains some
promising material.

Next week this group will prac-
tice at the regular hand rehearsal
periods, Tuesday and Thursday at
4:30 in Chicago hall. It is probable
that this freshman band will furnish
the music for the first pep meeting
of the year, and will appear nu some
other occasions. It will eventually
merge with the college band. The
latter will begin rehearsals the sec-
ond week of the semester.

The freshman membership is as
follows: tuba, Adrian Dunn; bari—
tone, Craig Robertson; trombones,
Lawrence Kinnamon, Duane McCur-

Observer Describes Gory Struggle
Between Freshmen and Sophomores

EY THE CASUAL OBSERVER.

The curious and foresighted male
freshman may learn somthing to his
interest by conducting a thorough
and careful scrutiny of the greens-
ward in back of the men's dormitor—
ies, Here the green grasses wave
gently in the soft autumn breezes,
the tepid sun shines overhead, and
the scene is one of drowsy pastoral
serenity. But the appearance of the
place belies its history, for observant
eyes, nay, even freshman eyes, may
descry in the midst of the plain of
verdure, a serried circle in which the
turb is torn and the earth trampled
as though a herd of buffalo had stag-
ed a dizzy stampede around and
around and around. There are deep
deep gashes in the ground, and the
entire surface hereabouts is gashed
and bare, as the battlefield of some
colossal struggle between armies of
giants.

Here, in this circle of hell, which

Thanksgiving Vacation
Shorter ; Christmas Longer

Announcements printed in the last
college catalog reveal that Thanks-
giving rccess has been reduced to one
day, November 28. At the same
time, it reveals a lengthening of the
Christmas holidays from two weeks
to seventeen days, December 20 to
January 7.

These changes are in accordance
with an adoption of the student coun-
cil made last spring to enable stu-
dents living at a distance from Grin»
nail to have more time at the Chirst-
mas holidays, since they are unable to
get home during the short Thanks-
giving recess.

Y. M. Meeting Tomorrow
in Building IV Clubrooms

The Y. M. c. A. will hold its first
meeting Sunday evening at 7:30 in
the clubrocm of Building IV, Orville
Sharnborg, president, announced
yesterday. The purpose of the meet~
bag will be to explain the policies and
projects of the Y to the college men,
and to discuss the benefits of the
Geneva conference which many of the
Y cabinet attended this summer.

Faculty advisersfor the Y. are L.

hoped that some few perspicacious
souls will recognize the significance
of the word “fall." One each year at
an unearthly hour, just as the half
frozen sun creeps shivering over the
top of the mist bathed stadium, a
struggle of Titans takes place in the
grey dawn following a long dark
night, and freshman brawn is pitted
against sophomore brains. Casually
we might observe that the frauds al-
ways ends in a tie, though the pun
will be meaningless to the uninitiate.

Just about the time that the home-
SiCk freshman learns to twist his
body to conform to the queer con-
volutions of his particular cot and
gets so that he can sleep 0' nights
all alone in his darkened room, he
will find himself deprived of a
precious night of slumber and set to
wandering over the countryside in
pursuit of fugitive sophomores. All

H'ammill to Speak at Airport
Dedication; Football
on Saturday.

The Grinnell college homecoming
to be held a month from now on Oc-
tober 1s, 19, and 20, will he made
doubly attractive by its conjunction
with the city of Grinnell’s Diamond
Jubilee," celebrating the seventy-
fifth anniversary of the founding of
the town. The , three-day program
will feature the formal dedication of
the Grinnell airport east of Grinnell
on Friday morning, at which Gov.
John Hammill will be the chief speak-
er.

The afternoon program will consist
of an aeronautical show, with prom»
inent aeroplanes, monoplanes and
pilots of the country performing. On
Friday evening a historical pageant
will be given, with elaborate drama-
tization of the founding of Grinnell
city and college.

Activities at Grinnell college and
Ward field will predominate Satur-
day. The Grinnell college football
men meet the Bears of Washington
university of St. Louis, Mo., in the
homecoming tilt of the afternoon. Us-
ual parties, homecoming skits, wel-
comes and a feature costume ball
are also scheduled for the one day
when the “old gang" comes back.

“Gary" Cooper, 9x126, noted Para—
mount motion picture star and a stu-
dent nt Grinnell two year, will be
the honor guest at the game Satur-
day. if contracts and work at Holly-
wood permit his return to his alma
mater. Harry Ogg of Newton has
offered the services of his plane,
“Smilin’ Thru,” for the transporta~
tion of Cooper.

Grinneilians will observe Sunday
with services in churches of the city,
as well as vespers at Herrick chapel
in the afternoon.

An organization group of eighteen

Watt Lightens
Gridiron Drill
- for Week-End

Early Grind Smooths Plays;
Line Charging Fast,
Evenly.

Good Backs Contend

Endmen Perform Like Regulars;
Lund Bolsters Tackles;
Guards Chosen.

With only light workouts Friday
and Saturday to end aweek of strenu-
ous daily practice sessions, Coach L.
Watt rounded the preseason foot-
hall grind out by a short scrimmage
following the Grinnell-Toledo high
school game here today.

The Week has done wonders in the
way of putting together a smooth
machine, functioning well in very de-
partment of the game. The linemen
are charging hard and fast, trick
plays and fast hidden ball plays are
used continually. The addition of
Thomas to the backfield has helped
put the Pioneer running attack on its
feet with McIntire and Rose up to
standard while Ruff and Richey are
even better at carrying the oval than
they were last season.

The mentor has only eight back-
field men out for practice but these
eight are all good men and the com—
petition is stiff for first rank births.
With Thomas and McIntlre at quar-
ters. Rose and Douglass for full-
backs and Lledtke, Ruff, Richey and
Hensley he will be able to shift his
backfield about almost continually
without weakening it to any great
extent.

Elite and Briggs are performing
like regular ends with Minler show—
ing a flash of 1928 form with the in-
dication that he may round into
shape for some great competition be»
fore the close of the season. Walker,
Klinefelter and Humphrey are good
enough at the tackles and John Lund
reported Friday to bolster hopes in
that department.

Business Staff Tryoulers

Report M and ay Afternoon

All those wishing to tryout for pos-
itions on either the business or cir—
culation staffs of the SCARLET AND
BLACK report at the office Monday
afternoon between one and three p.
m,, Donald G. Rutherford announced
this morning.

Tryouts will extend over a period
of several issues and it is necessary
that those trying out report Monday
afternoon.

Grinnell students, as always,
spread themselves well over the na»
tion last summer. No town held two
at once, unless when a caravan of
magazine salesmen under Don Ruth-
erford or Al Diehl descended en
masse, stripped housewives of their
savings, and fled like vagabond Bo-
hemians before the natives had de-
veloped an antitocsin of sales resist-
ance,

One gang leader pointed with pride
to an average net earning of almost
four hundred dollars among Grinnell
salesman. Such calculations omitted
celebrities fired in the first fortnight
of service. Such was “Able“ Abeles,
tax-’32, who incurred local ire when,
finding no one at home, he went to
sleep in the porch hammock,

Aluminum also looked like an at-
tractlve commodity to peddle when
viewed through the rosy spectacles
of June. Thirteen happy college boys
equipped themselves with samples a.
little after graduation and set out
for the end of the rainbow. The first
one gave up the first week, and un—
merciful disaster followed fast and
followed faster until only the re-
doubtable Ed Allen and Al Johnson
remained at the end of the season.

Dwight Smiley came back in July
with pneumonia contracted after a
midnight swim in Clear Lake. A few
kitchenware dispensers have not yet

All new women were entertained
by the W. A. A. at Seven-forty—five
this morning at the Band gymnas-
ium. Walls of the upstairs rooms
were hung with pennants and
lndian blankets, and all decorations
followed a sports theme. After the
breakfast, short talks were given by
Miss Clara J. Andersen, and Miss
Harriett Koglln of the physical edu-
Cation departznent. Members of the
executive board of the w. A. A.

them for assets in imminent matri-
monial campaigns.

“The bedbugs were terrible," was
the most specific news obtained from
Harold Rose in regard to how a foot-
ball captain spends his summers. Fol-
lowing the Red Grange tradition of
day laborers jobs for pigskin aspir—
ants, Rose and Cooper sought a pay-
ing pasttime in the big timber,
where although they would fain have
dismissed the reporter with a state—
ment that they put on lots of muscle
it was finally ascertained that they
tied cables around fallen trees. where
a hole had already been dug under-
neath, and placidly watched the
donkey engine haul the logs to the
mill.

Among the more miscellaneous
summers was that of Davis Greene,
who, in addition to acting as head
garener, head chauffeur, and head
butler for himself and family, spent
a little spare time sailing, over the
bounding main. In place of the thir-
teen foot sloop which be publicly
promised to display on Arbor Lake
this fall he has brought only a put!-
ly decorative forty inch schoonerette.

Another Smithite is worried about
the unemployment problem. Accord-
ing to his own story he traversed
thirteen states and three provinces
hunting for a job; finally in despair
he returned to his home town and en—
tered the tennis tournament.

Saturday Aim-noon.

With the general reception tonight:
at eight o’clock and the torchlight
procession Friday night. for the first
,time managed by the student coun-
cil rather than the Y. M. and Y. W.
c. A., the college looks forward to
the only all»college formal and most
pretentious pep meeting of the year.
This evening, faculty, new students,
and old students meet. dressed form-
mally, and are received by faculty
and student executives.

The reception line this evening wiu
include President and Mrs. J. H. Ti
Main, Dean 3nd Mrs. J. S. NDllen.’
Dean Luella J, Read and Dean She!-
ton Beatty, Blanche Hulsebus, presv
ident of the Y. W. C. A., Orville

chairman of the Y. W. C. A.

Main to Taur

The drawing-room will he decorat-
ed with flowers and palms, and fol-
lowing the reception, entertainment.
in charge of Candace Packard, will
be given. President Main will give
a short welcoming talk, the men's
glee club will sing. and instrumental
music will be given by Edward Shad-
bolt at the piano, and by a musical
trio, consisting of Dan Woods, rvio-
linist, Wayne Richards, cellist, and
Edward Shadbolt, pianist. Follow-
ing the program the usual custom of
holding open houses in each of the
cottage parlors will be observed.

The torchllght procession next Fri-
day night before the Penn football
game Saturday rivals the general
reception in student interest, al-
though in a different manner. This
traditional opening for the athletic
season is in charge of the student
council, and although definite plans
have not been made, the usual pro-
cedure will probably be followed.

Football Men Introduced.

Stuents meet at the appointed
place on the campus, receive and
light their torches, and forming in
line, parade through the town. Stops
are made before President Main's
home, where he joins the party, and
on various street corners downtown
where yells are given. Members of
the football squad are introduced.
The procession winds up at Ward
field where entertainment is provid-
ed, after which there is informal
dancing in the recreation room at
the quadrangle.

Coggesh—all Wins
National Standing

Harris Coggeshall, who, according
to the New York Journal has all the
tennis ability of a coming champion
but lacks the competitive spirit to
make a really great player, showed
just a bit of that battling spirit in
the National Championship meet late
this summer when he forced Fritz
Marcur, seventh in national ranking,
five full sets, three being dented, be-
fore he was downed.

Coggeshbll’s early summer show-
ing, while good, was not auspicious.
lie was eliminated by Jacobs in the
quarter ‘finals of the national intera
collegiates and it seemed that his
fourteenth ranking was about to go
glimmering.
