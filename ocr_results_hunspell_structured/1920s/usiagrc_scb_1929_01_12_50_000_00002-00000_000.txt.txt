Certain difficulties will always lie in tiie handling

teachers \0 grades to those who can find them to raise

ed liy students anxious to learn their grades.

If these difiicultics for both students and instrilCr
tors were neces it would he had enough. But these
treuhles are not. A slight change in the procedure would ‘
enahle every student to learn his grade as soon as the
marks in that class had been determined, and free ieziellc
e s trom a steady stream of inquirer To accomplish
this end, The Daily Nehraskan propos. the iollowing
plan: .

1. All examination papers when handed in will be
numhered. The professor has the student's name and
number on the examination paper. The student can
readil i-eineiniicr his number for each course

2. As soon as the papers are graded and the semes-
ter grade determined, each instructor will he required to
post a list of grades for his class using the examination
numbers to let each indivldiiai tinti his grade without re-
yealing it to others.

3. Previous to the posting of the grades, it will be
under-stood that there would he no use asking for inter
much as the grades Wouldn’t, he ready,

Such a plan is neither oi ginai or unique, It is
working successtuily in other institutions. it would re<
here many unpleasant diiiieuities oi the present iacir oi
system.—Daily Nehraslran.

_ It President Mnln and the student hotly at large
had not accepted the house chaii‘inen’s plan on “prep-
plug,” this column could he devoted to one more tirade
on the subject. Houerer, everybody is happy over that
silbjee the Women's League hoard stays up until the
wee spin 1 hours in'a conscientious endeavor to perform
their duties; and we are all iindins out that there is
many a slip 'tivixt A. R. H. and chapel.
