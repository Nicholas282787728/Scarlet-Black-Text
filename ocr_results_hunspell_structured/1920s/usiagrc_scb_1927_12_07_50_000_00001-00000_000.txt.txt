Australians More British Than
the British, Professor at
Sydney Asserts,

EXPLAINS WHITE POLICY

People More Interested In Horse
That Wins Melbourne Cup
Than In League.

“The Australians are perhaps more
Br sh than the Brit h themselves,"
asserted Dr G. \ Portus. professor of
economic history at the University of
Sydliel' in speaking on the "Economic
Histor) of Australia” in the chapel
Monday evening.

“The Australians have grown up
with the advantages of sunshine, and
no social distinctions,” Dr. Fort“: snid.
"They are less fortunate than the Bri-
tish, however, in their isolation from
other countries; this tends to make
them less cultured and less patient
than the British. But We may improve
in limeiW‘hD knows?”

"Australia," Dr. Portlls said, “is a
land of paradoxes. It has an area
equal to that of the United states, and
,a population equal to that of New York
city, It has the greatest metropolitan
concentration of any country in the
world with is pcr cent of the popula—
‘tion living in the six capital cities;
yet its manufacturing exports are neg—
ligible.
Australia Convict Settlcmth

“Australia had no pilgrim fathers,
for it was first a convict settlement
under military rule. It was connected
with Europe by the wool trade; the
early history of Australia can4be writ
ten in terms of wool. ’ ‘

“The supremacy of wool was chal-
lenged in 1351 by the discovery of
gold. The population of Australia in-
creased three and a half times in the
following decade: the Australian type,
that is not altogether British. was es-
tablished by the goldrrushers. The
Australians are an independent, rest-
less people, defiant of conventions."

This national humor, Dr. Portus felt,
is due partly to environment, but
largely to the personality of the gold
seeker, He was “the liberal, the reh-
el," who was disheartened by oppress
sion in the old country and had heard
oi the gold and self government to be
”had in Australia.

"We‘ve never had a battle in Aus
traila," Dr. Portus said. The nearest
thing to a pitched fight was a. scrap
between the goldrdiggers and poliue~
men in the 'fiities, when twenty men
were killed.

Gold Finished in 1856.

“In 1856 the alluvial gold was fin-
ished," Dr. Portus stated. “The mi-
ners left for the cities, and machines
went out to the gold fields."

Australia got self government in
1350, and by 1858 she had manhood
suffrage. The first Chinese exclusion
act was passed in 1860, and in 1901 the
Labor party secured permanent exclur
sion of Orientals This is the basis
of the White Australia policy.

"There are three legs to the White
Australia policy," Dr. Portns said. The
laboring men/object to the roroigncrs
because they bring with them low
standards of living, Socially, the Aus-
trulinns do not care to invite the race
problems that are troubling America
and South Africa. The third leg is par
litical: if the aliens, ith their differ-
ent culture and civr ization, get the
vote, no one can prophesy what will
happen,

Indifferent Intcnluﬁonally.

"Australia's isolation from other
countries has made her indifferent to
international affairs. We have become
intensely Australian, and have adopted
a superior attitude toward the rest of
the world. I think the Americans are
like us in that respect," Dr. portus rec
marked. ,

“The League of Nations has brought
a little interest in foreign affairs, but
not much. We are more concerned
about what horse wins the Melbourne
CHI).

"The climate of Australia makes for
community life. Since the tempera-
ture is never below forty degrees, it
isn't too cold to go to meetings.

"Most of the year we can live out-
doors; consequently there are no peo-

il)’ lillu'nrll Mien.
“Chicago‘s gun wars will continue,
until prohibition is either repealed or‘
enforced. Until this happens reporting
in that city will remain more fascinat-
ing than in any other city in this coun»
try,” Having made these two state-
mcnts, Janics Mulroy, who at twenty-
eight is star reporter for the Chicago
DAILY NEWS, stretched out his 220
pounds, yawued and refused to say any
more uirtil he bird received my assuiu
mice that his speech to the lawn High
School Press convention that afternoon
had been worth listening to. Then
he declared himself ready to answer
any question on any subject.

Tum ﬁlms in Chicago Are Caused by
Prohibition, Mulroy Tells Reporter

"Why has Chicago become the eel-la
ter of the gangs of foreign culetllroats
that infest it today? Because it is pres

carry on illegal traffic in honor. it
was not hard to buy beer for five dole

with a demand over in excess or sup-

”Onc, two or eyen three bands could

paused as if flunking of some of the
many murders he has had to report,
of his almost daily contact with the
gunmen themselves—"wail, one of the
gangs had to go. That is the story of
Chicago's gang wars, As for catching
the murderers, that is almost imllnssir

ials bought off at their own price and

counting his greenbaclrs leisurely to
see if he had enough money to get
back to Chicago.

“The emphasis in metropolitan re-
porting today," said Mr. Mulroy, when
asked about the reporter's life in large
cities .. ,: ‘Get the Noam Nowhere

where reporting will drop from a life

head almost invariably swells. Then,
more than ever, a mcrc beginner in the
game may ‘scfiup' him on a piece oi
news with perfect ease."

That journalism as a profession is
on the rise Mr. ulroy emphatically
stated in conclusion. Frowning on the
schools of journalism because they
prepare men for the mere mechanical
side of reporting, he believes that a
liberal arts education with a few
journalistic courses thrown in srroh as
is offered here at Grinnell is the best
preparation for the profession of re»
porting.

MRS. LEEHﬂN URGES
USE WIRINALHY

Advises Liberal] Arts Course As
Best Training for Future
Work In J oumulisrn.

By Aileen )lllligiill.
“Journalism schools do not provide
the best training for newspaper work,"
according to Mrs. Helen Cowles Le-
Cron, literary editor of the Des Monies
REGISTER.

When interviewed here Saturday,
Mrs. LeCron said, "The journalist
needs a broad education such as ,‘ue
may obtain in a liberal arts college or.
even, for himself. Technical training
for newspaper work teaches the re-
porter to conform too closely to set
rules, and curtails bis originality,"
Mrs. LeCrou pointed out that this
friginalify is a vital factor in the
make-up of the .ucccssrul ire.
n'ul‘ke , In speaking other 0.
she illustrated the need of the journal-
ist for varied and creative ideas. “1
edit three hook departments; one in
the Des Moines REGISTER, one in
BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS, and
one in a children's magazine. I try to
make these departments interesting by

varying the features and introducing,

other new elements from time to time.
and I’m conceited enough to believe
that I succeed,"

Maintains Dcpurtmcllts.

Though she insists that variety is
vital to success, Ml LeCroll supports
the practice of maintaining certain
hcadlines and departments in the same
location from issue to issue, She said,
“I like to pick rip a newspaper and be
able to find certain departments with

articles.

sneaking particularly of the woman
journalist, Mr . LeCron described the
need for other qualities besides origi-
nality. She said, "i have noticed that
the woman who succeeds in the strict-
ly news phaseot journalism is the
daring type who will go anywhere and
try anything in the tracking of news.
She sees the romance in the jounalist-
ic field, and follows her profession res
lcntlessly at all hours and in all types
of places."

Siluiztsts Cultural Writing.

For the woman writer to whom the
reporting oi trials, crimes, and similar-
news does not appeal, ,ilrs. LeCrnn
suggested the fields of society writing
or magazine work. She regards the
possibilities in these lines as promis-
ing, and indicated that they ought to
have greater appeal than the straight
news field for the more cultured woe
men,

Sﬁidents Dine, Discuss Plato and
Importance of Prayer for Potatoes

The dining room at the dormitories
and the cllib room of Building Four
furnished the setting for a meeting of
onc'of the most intellectual gatherings
in the history of this college. It is a
question whether the other diners
realized just what a select group was
in their midst, and it is still more of a
question whether- they would have Kip»
precinted the fact. For it takes a
scholar to appreciate an erudite! (N0
bdrm intended.)

For the beneiit of those who are
still unaware of last nights philosophie
cal banquet. let me state that in spite
of the lack of such delicacies as were
pliilusoplllzed over in Pluto’s day, it
was very delightful to reflect unon
ponder-oils matters over the traditional
roastrbeef and gravy.

And it was even more enjoyable to
sit in front of a glowing fireplace and
think of remarks that we might make
ftnd questions we might ask, were it
not for some few who felt it their
duty to loqllaclously quiz other mem-
bers of the party upon their religious
viewsfwllli such ludicrous questions
as “Who in the devil believes in the
devil’” and numerous anecdotes to

 

illustrate the powers of the super-
natural, such as the story about the
“lady who prayed and prayed, for po-
tiltoesi" Very enlightening. And in
the midst of these rapid—fire questions.
several interested persons became ex»
iiiillstetl from their repeated attmpts to
jom in the conversation, and from then
on, they silently agreed 0r disagreed

But seriously speaking, I should like
to comment most favor-ably upon the
rvcning and its rcpartec. Even to
rrofessor Stoops it must illwc been
quite satisfactory—with his youthful
dinner partner, and pickles! As for
comfort, just try to compare the over~
stuffed chairs of Building Tour with
the one-armed contraptions in A. k. H.
It was more an atmosphere for
Epicureanism than for the less world-
ly philosophy of Pluto,

With practice, such banquets would
become scientific, and discussion might
become more specificsand at the same
time more general! For the festal
occasion was just far enough away
from the academic to be novel, and
just close enough to it to retain that
trace of dignity which characterizes
the subject of philosophy.

Are Present at Meeting In
St. Louis Saturday,

PLAN SEVEN SCHOOL GROUP

Three New Schools Have Imposing
Records In Basketball And
Football Sports.

Definite steps were taken to perpet-
uate the Missouri Valley conference
when a meeting was held of the Mis-
souri Valley “Orphans” at St. Louis,
Missouri, last Saturday.

Faculty members of the four re-
maining school voted to fill the gap
left by the secession of the “Big Six "
W. P, Edmunds of Washington univer-
sity, leader in organizing the “Orr
phans, said that the new organization
would retain the name Missouri Valley
conference, and that it would be well
under way to perfection by Christ-
mas.
To Meet ill-cry Team.

The schbols which have been invited
into the conference who had repre-
sentatlves at the meeting were Creigh-
ton, Marquette. and Butler. Plans
were made for a seven temp organiza»
tion, but other schools were also con-
sidered for membership. The advam
tagc of a smaller conference is that
each team will be able to meet every
other team in the conference without
having too heavy a schedule.

The three new schools which were
present at the, meeting would materials
ly raise the standing of the conference
in athletic circles. Creighton always
has a good basketball team, last sear
son defeating six Missouri Valley
schools, and only losing one, the Unis
versity of kansas, Valley champions,
by the score of 29 to 31.

Butler also has good basketball
teams, and last year defeated the state
universities of Town and Illinois. Mar-
quette has good football teams every
year, and during this past season dea
feated Grinnell, Ames, St. Louis uni-
versity, and held the Army to nine
points. '

McCourt Heads Organization.

Dean W. C, MCCoul't' of Washington
university was’elected to represent the
conference at the national inter-col-
legiate meeting in New York during
December.

Consideration was also given to the
request of some of the coaches that the
non-scouting agreement should be re-
pealed. Some coaches also asked that
the pro-season practice period he
lengthened. Up to this time the period
has been limited to not before Septem-
ber 15.
