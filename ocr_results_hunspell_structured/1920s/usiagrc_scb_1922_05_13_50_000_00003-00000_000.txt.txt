NEW BALIII] SIATEE
sniliuiﬂlitiuii

Prof, Lord Talks on Lithuania,
Latvia. and Esthom'd in
Chapel Monday.

The new Baltic States ot Lithuania,
Ldtvia, and Esthoulzt were treated by
Prof. Robert H. Lord in his 5 -th
Harvard exchange lecture in Herrick
Chapel Thursday. in opening the lee
turer stated that these three states
rank os the smallest, weakest, and
most prohlemetlcal or the republics
ol Europe, Each is anout the size or
the state at Maine and has a popula-
tion of two million. The aristocracy
and hour-geoise of Lithuania are the
Poles while the Germans occupy this
position in the other two countries.
The Esths speak the language of the
Finns while the Letts and the Lithuan-
isns speak one independent branch or
the Indo European language.

Having given this preliminary
sketch ot the new states Professor
Lord sketched the historical develop-
ment at each, Latvia and Esthunia
were early conquered by the Germ-
ans who colonized and industrialized
the provinces. Peter the Great won
the provinces tor Russia under whose
control they remained until the time
at the Bolshevik revolution, Lithu-
ania was at one time a large country
hut in 1383 it was united with Poland
and gradually lost its nationality, be
ing tused with that country. in 1517
all three of these countries set up
their own governments which were
recognized by the most of the allies at
the Peace Cohterence. Great ditlicul-
ty was experienced setting up their
governments because at the Bolshe-
viks in the country hut these were
ﬁnally expelled with the aid or: Eng-
land, who considers the Baltic coun—
tries as one or her spheres at inﬂu—
ence. A stable constitutional govern-
ment was set up early by the Esths,
republican and cabinet in tor-m but the
Letts have not as yet a constitution.
Lithuania exprienced little trouble in
getting organized but the government
has not been progressive due to the
dlspute with Poland over~thet dispo-
sition ot the city or Vilna.

Professor Lord leels that the Here

 

munence of these states must be
marked with a large interrogation

sign since their independence deprives ‘

Russia or all seaboard ports on the
Baltic with the exception or Petrograd,
a situation to which Russia will never
acquiesce.

Brown Director Says
Authorities To Blame

Providence, R. l.—Responsihility tor
prciessrouallsm in intercollegiate
sports is placed squarely upon the
shoulders or univcr ity otticmls by Dr.
Fred w. Marvel, director or athletics
at Brown university. Dr. Marvel de~
clures that heads of college athletic
departments are lorced to coroercial-
ize major sports in order to obtain
money to run intramural and non-pay-
ing games and support their gymna-
slums.

Dr. Marvel asserts that athletJCs in
college are as much a part or the cur-
Ilcuium as any study and that nniver»
sities should assume all responsibility,
including ﬁnancial, ,

This course, he declared, is the only
constructive policy which will ellmi-‘
nate the menace ol professionalism
among amateur games. ‘

"At the present time our athletic‘
directors and team managers have tcl
mnhe their associations pay and in or,
der to do so are obliged to raise money
by gate receipts,” he asserts. “We are,
told by college ofileials that we mustj
conduct our games along amateur!
llnes, but we must hnance them alougi
lines that are purely commercial and
Professional."

Amateur sports will never he on a‘
proper basis, Dr. Marvel said, "unlil‘
the university assumes all responsi—
bility, including ﬁnancial,"

l

Protessors Peck and Rutherford will
go to the Mississippi valley ulster-l7
cal Association Convention at Iowa
City on Thursday and Friday or this
week, Among the speakers at the‘
convention will he James Hervey
Robinson who is one of the rol'emost‘
authors and historians in the United}
States. Professor Robinson will he in
Grillnell on Saturday May 13 and will
speak in lieriiclt Chapel at 10:30 in
the morning.

The members of the Mai-shalltown
Women's Club will be the guests or
the Dramatic Club on Saturday, May
27. A dramatic play, the name of
which has not been Officially an—
nounced, will be given by the Drae
nlatie Club in the open air theater.

 

Two rare pennies are in bloom in
the college botanic garden. The' light

Theresa, Sparks, The dark red single

Mrs. A. W, Child. Both plants are
