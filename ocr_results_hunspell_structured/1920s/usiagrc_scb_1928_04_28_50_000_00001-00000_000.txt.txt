"The Other Men’s Point of View”
Is Theme of Talk Given by
Prof. H W. Norris.

U. S. POLICY IS WRONG

All Great Wars In History Have
Resulted From A Failure
' To See Otbet‘s View,

“The remedy ot the world's ills is
tolerant appreciation or the other-
man's point of view—looking at the
world's problems through the eyes of
our enemies, as well as through the
eyes of our friends." This was Prof.
H. W. he ’s assertion in a talk on
“The other Man’s Point of View." at
senior chapel Friday.

“All great wars," Mr. Norris said.
“result from failure to appreciate the
fact that all peoples have a right to
their own views and their own lite.

“The United States is an object of
well-icnnded suspicion in South
America, because we refused to con-
sidcr the culture and the viewpoint
of the South American countries.

“When has an inlpo or 'c govern-
ment ilsed appreciation in its Colonial
policies? Yet there is no other Way
out, with safety to both parties.

"We are only now coming to see
our mistakes in missionary work. We
harc tried to impress an Anglo-Saxon
Christianity- upon cultures, with the
result that We have destroyed the in-
digenous morality and culture, and
have substituted nothing for it. The
idea of a Japanese or an indian
Christianity is still so new that it
sends shivers up and down the ortho-
dox spine,

Scores D. A. ll. liladkl t.
"The D. A. n. blacklists show an
astonishing amount of feeling against
persons who hold any point of view
not sanctioned by a heaven-born few."
lir. Norris urged looking at the
other fellow's point of view in matters
of student government. “The Fresh-
man class," he stated, “has the same
right to courteous treatment that the
others have. \
"Two thousand years ago," Mr. Nor-
ris continued, "a young man tried to
clean up his home town. He was run
out Then he went to other towns.
preaching tolerance and love to a
larger consutuency.

"Two hundred years later, men had
forgotten what Jesus said. But they
were stirred up to bitter bate by what
men were saying, had said, or might
possibly say about Jesus,

“So ever since all Christians have
been killing each other off, No group
has had the moral courage to stop
war. The Church, not even consider-
ing the issue, stands condemned, as
organized futility.”

Senior Chapel Speaker.
Professor Norris appeared as the
second speaker in a Series scheduled
for the senior program. As part oi the
senior services Prof. J. D. Stoops ivill
conduct the senior vcspers tomorrow;
Miss Leah Pratt will present a musical
program probably on May 3; Dr. G,

ists will give the Overture irom Tann-
bauser May 11; and Prci, Charles E.
Payne will conclude the series of sen-
ior chapel talks May 18.
