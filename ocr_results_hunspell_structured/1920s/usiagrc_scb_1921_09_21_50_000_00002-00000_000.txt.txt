Freshmen, in particulér,

these ﬁrst few open meetings and sec‘
for themselves the type and the work|

of each.

New students will ﬁnd that the so-
cieties have a very deﬁnite part in the
activities of the average student. but
particularly in those ot the under
classmen. For the men, in the air,
scnce oi'trsternitles, the society means}
a broader fellowship, literary training1
and debating work, in both luter-soci~
ety and inter-scholastic fields. For the
girls, there are the regular programs!
reading and speaking contests, and the
various activities sponsored by the in—
dividual All join
various social activities thruout the
year.

It is comparatively easy, with the

organizations. in

system used here a! sophomore selec»
lion, for the girls to select the group
with which they are naturally allied
and wish to associate. The situation

is more difficult for the for

men,
freshmen are eligible and often, in the‘
rush or business, they attiliate with an,
organization with which they are not
congenial. All non-society men who
wish tn loin should take time to incite
a careful inspgction ot the four organ-
izations, pick the group with whom
they wish to associate, and then make
application for membership. Opens
meetings will he held tor the next.

time to make a careful choice.

Under the previous system it was
clearly demonstrated that the chici,
function or the student Council was
to provide a nice honor tor the mono

That, indeed, has been the fate of all
such oi-ganize’uions of class represeir

Organizations, however, such as that

: How Do Hot Things Cool?

HE blacksmith draws a white-hot bar from the
forge. It begins at once to cool. How does it lose
its heat? Some is radiated, as heat is radiated by

the sun; but some is carried away by the surrounding air.
Now suppose the bar to be only one-half the diameter;
in that case it loses heat only half as fast. Smaller bars lose
in propoltion. It would seem that this proportion should
hold, however much the scale is reduced. But does it?
Does a ﬁne glowing wire lose heat in proportion to its
diminished size?

The Research Laboratories of the General Electric
Company began a purely scientiﬁc investigation to
ascertain just how fast a glowing wire loses heat. It was
found that for small bodies the old simple law did not
hold at all. A hot wire .010 in. diameter dissipates 'heai:

'only about 12 per cent more rapidly than a wire .005 in.

diameter instead of twice as fast as might be expected.

The new fact does not appear very important, yet it
helped bring about a revolution in lighting. 4

It had been found that a heated ﬁlament in a vacuum
evaporated like water and that this evaporation could be
retarded by introducing an inert gas such as nitrogen or
argon. But it had long been lmown that the presence of
gas in the ordinary incandescent lamp caused so much
heat to be carried from the ﬁlament that the lamp was
made useless. The new understanding of the laws of heat
from wires, however, pointed out a way of avoilzlirlg the
supposed necessity of a vacuum.

By forming the ﬁne tungsten ﬁlament into a helix the
heat: loss was made much less prominent. The light
radiated is then about the same as if the wire were
stretched out, but the heat loss through the gas is very
much less. So the tightly coiled ﬁlament was put into the
gasrﬁlled bulb—and a new lamp was created. At the
same Cost it gave more and better light.

Thus pure research, conducted primarily to fil’ld out
how hot things cool, led to the invenn‘on of the gas-ﬁlled
lamp of today—the cheapest, most efﬁcient illuminant
thus far produced. '

Sooner or later research in pure science enriches the
world with discoveries that can be practically applied.
For this reason the Research Laboratories devote much
time to the study of purely scientiﬁc problems.
