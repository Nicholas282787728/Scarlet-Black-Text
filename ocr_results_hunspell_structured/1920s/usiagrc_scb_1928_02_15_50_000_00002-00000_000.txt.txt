ABDLITION 0F ANOTHER TRADITION.

G'rinnell has lost another tradition through the ties
troyiug action of the Men's Senate. The old rule, no
smoking un the compus, is no longer depriving the men
ironi smoking anywhere they please on Llle college
grounds ercept inside oi the college buildings. it is
’strange that this latter restriction was passed as the old
formula of etiquette, do not smohe‘in the presence oi
women, is no longer regarded as proper.

The loss oi this good old tradition is still pnintui to
some oi the more conservative alumni and students, and
members or the iaculty. it was a good tradition no doubt,
but what was its him? Why deprlve‘ a man or the joy oi
a, smoke just because he is on college propertyi To use
Prolessor Stoops' own plil'ilsei‘ﬁl. is the height or bunk."
Perhaps the less literal opposition, which considers Grin—
hell he one big tamily, would quote 0. w. Hollnes' StilleV
ment,‘h9wever. applying it to the college instead of the
individual: “No. my triends, 1 go (always other thin
being equal) tor the college that inherits rumiiy iradi»
tions and the cumulative humanities of at least four or
five generations." Gl'iuuell is becoming an immoral
school, it would appear, torsuking the advice oi the old
generations and coniormiug to the customs the younger

in smoking on the campus. There s no lo

cuse why one should not: this is a free country, extell one
is entitled to enjoy happiness, and as it is the custom tor
every person to smoke, let them do so wherever they
wish within the bounds of courtesy. Perhaps the libertils
would quote George Eliot, “We had not walked but tor
tradition. we walk cvermore to higher pdths by brighten-
ing Reason’s lamp." The men or Gl'luuell find it H“ -
sortable and expedient in order to be on the same euunr
lity with other uni crsities and colleges of the country,
to abolish another Grinnell tradition.

Now as a luau goes into Class he tosses his cigfll'et
butt into llle corner of the dour-way, and us he comes
out he scratches his match on the white stone worli.
and lights at clgaret which sooner or later will be lodged
on some doorway corner.

“’9 have no quarrel with the new rule, but we would
li e to admonish the men not to take advantage of its
liberty in littering the campus with cigaret butts and
matches. They can just as easily be thrown in the
street as in from of the doorway.

A TEST 01" SENTIMHNT.

The number of students who vote Friday on the
proposed amendments to the student Constitution will
in a way determine the proportion of those who are
really interested in student government in Grinnell. Thnt
two-thirds of the mell in college attended the mass meet-
iiig yesterday would be a liberal estimate. We hope that
more will cast a ballot, for it requires a three-quarter mas
jority to pass an amendment.

Even if the men vote “no" on every proposition, and
actually register their interest by such nation, it will
mean something. But ll they stay away (tom the ballot
buVes, we are inclined to believe that they do not care a
“tinker‘s damn" whether we have student or faculty gov»
crrinient,

As was brought out at the moss meeeting yesterday,
it anything could be considered to be brought out at
such or hodge-pouge ol side-stepping discussion, the pro-
posed amendments are not going to be able to radically
improve student government; they are hilt tangible ways
of helping along its machinci . The only way that any
reform can be carried out is through the assumption on

the part. or the student or the responsibility for their .

oun behavior. otherwise we might as well have faculty
control.

The clause providing [or a different manner of elects
ing Court members, and the one providing tor a change
in viting and the assumption of a man’ innocence until
he is proven guilty are but improvements in machinery
The real issue lies in the clause providing tor punisllr
meut as the Court sees fit in case of perjury. The Court
is a reasonable body or men; it is not going to abuse this
privilege, ii it is granted. Those who have no intention
to commit the perjury offense have no cause to worry
about it. If they are going to accept the rcsousbility of
conducting their own atfnirs by telling the whole truth
and nothing but the truth about what they lmow in
Court. cases, the perjury clause will never direct them.

It will he the vote on the pe\ ivy clause which will
be a test ot student sentiment; it will be this ballot. that
decides whether or not the students really care for stu»

dent government.
