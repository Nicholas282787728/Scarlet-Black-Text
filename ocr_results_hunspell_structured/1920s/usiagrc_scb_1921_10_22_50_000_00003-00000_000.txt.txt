"Wily We should study Birds” was
the subject chosen by Dr Leroy 1‘.
Weeks Friday evening when he do».
college lecture rr-r Herrick
Chanel.

We should study birds because
their value from an economic stand,
point. Few of us realize what birds
are of material value Lo us and wlrreh
ones ale lial'miul. What We need to
do is to study the dittoreut species so
that we will be able to distingursh the
beneﬁcial [mm the destructive bird.

We should also study birds because
the invisible things of God from the
creation oi the world are clearly seen
by the things that there are on earth,
God placed birds on earth for the
sake at humans and rrr order that man
may understand the underlying de-
SITE or expression which means hap-
pihess to all.

Dr. \l'ecks gave a number or reads
ings at his own poetry among which
“The Eob-o-Link" and “The Wren"
were \ery much appreciated by hrs
audience.
