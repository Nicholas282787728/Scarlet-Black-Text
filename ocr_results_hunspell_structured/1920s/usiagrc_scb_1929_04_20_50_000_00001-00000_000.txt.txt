Experienced Team Beats Smaller
Gridders in Spring Game
Thursday Night.

The runner-up to the Drake relays.
It isn't exactly an outstanding title
but it is just what the I<ansas relays
are this year at least for Grinnell,
As Coach Duke boarded the train
with his four trackmen last night his
face was longer than an old maid's
lists of prospects and it was only
sonlberly informing the world at
large of his many misgivings that he
conlessed that the Pioneers did have
a chance to place if every man on the
mile relay team was at his best,

The men making the trip are Tay-
lor, Pelletier, Mark and McKeeﬁa
quartet of ouarter milers who don't
do their running all in one place.
Even at their best this early in the
season the men will have to be hast-
ening right along to break 3:25 over
the 5.280 yard distance, Since advance
reporB have it that the Missouri.
Iowa and Northwestern units turn
this trick as a daily task, one may
easily under-stand that the Pioneers
are running in rather forlorn hopes.

Lady Luck hasn't made any efforts
of the team with any favor. A stretch
of bad weather kept the men from
practice; Miner pulled a tendon and
Pelletier was shoved into the breach.
As a final blow- to optimists, Joe
(Mother) Mcltee, star member of the
team, has been ill and it is doubtful
if he will be in top shape,

In addition to entering the mile rec
lay team, Coach Duke has entered
Taylor in the hurdles. Taylor is cap»
ahle of stepping the 120 yards with
the best of them if he can top the
high sticks without tipping them. He
was disqualified in the Notre Dame
meet for kicking to many- of them
around the track, but with the Adah
iional practice he may push the lead-
ers for their honors at Kansas.

or Grinnell lleu's in daily newspapers of this state and Illinois.

News in

terms or modern journalism is anything timely that holds the greatest amount

of interest for the greatest numbcr of people; yet many of the “stories" that
have appeared in the columns of middlewest dailies have failed to masure up

to this definition. either because of their lack of intraestnte and inter-

ate

interest or of the “detrimental advertising" that they have lent to Grinnell

college.

editor of the new Des Moines Daily
Herald which will soon be off the
press, accompanied his father, J. W.
Jarhagin, to the Sigma Delta Chi
Founders' Day Dinner in the men's
dining hall last Wednesday evening.
After the affair he discussed in my
presence the type of college news
which he believed to be or the right
kind and of enough importance to lie
published for state distribution, find

Mr. Jnl‘ungln stressed the fact that

Collegian wllo accidently gets into a
campus “scrape," "it certainly does not

by keeping the thing out, of the pil-

that would come to those at home

In referring to the side of the zir-
