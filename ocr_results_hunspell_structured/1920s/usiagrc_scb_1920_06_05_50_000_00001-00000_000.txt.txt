Lo, and as i slept 1 was awakened
by a murmur, w ich grew in volume
and 1 thought, on, surely it will be
sonic storm tonight, And I listened
and the rumbling continued but it did
not storm, tor it was not thunder-
which had disturbed my pcacciul slum-
bor. Determined to find the cause
of such an occul'ence i dressed and
started toward tolvn. As 1 neared
town the rumbling ‘grew louder and
louder until 1 was almost deafened
by the terrible roaring. it scenicd to
collie irom all directions at ouce‘, so
I fled to my room {or safety, and when
I awoke in the moi-mug all was quiet
and peaceful again. But 1 could not
rest until 1 had discovered from
whence came that awiril noiso, so I
started out again. Nowhere could i
find anyone that could help me until
, 1 wandered into the Herald ofiicc, and
‘Iliere I heard a low rumble like that
or the night before, but much less
lin volume, and I investigated, and lo.
:1 found that the great rumbling was
caused—not by the approaching cy-
clone—hut by the Malteascr' which
will reach Grimzell Monday.

lWould Oust Frats at
Wisconsin University

J A more on the part oi certain fctc~
tions or the University at Wisconsin
‘students and faculty to have a law
abolishing Greek Letter- fraternities
at the University passed at the next
.scssion at the state legislature is
causing much heated argument and
discussion at this university. Daily
communications appear in the col-
,unins or the Daily Cardinal, ofﬁcial
{daily paper of the university, attack—
ing both sides oi the question. The
sentiment is at present in favor or 1'24
taining the iraternities, because of
,thcir value in boosting their institu-
tion, and help in handling the new

jinen and women attending the Uni-
yvarsity.
