Styles in 'Poll cs, as Well as In

Since 1900.

“Every year European politics and
European thought sink into relative
unimportance with the shifting of ot-‘
tention to the Orient. The world in-
stead of the small area of Europe has
hecome the field of action,” declaredl
Prof. Genrge Grafton Wilson in hisl,
second Harvard exchange lecture ntl
long chapel, Thursday, May 3, “Styles
in politics, as well as in dress, have
changed since the beginning of the
century."

“When the century hegan, political
thought still helongcd to the Victorian
era. One of the first indications of‘
change of thought was/the movee

colonies of the British
Empire towards self-government. To-
day," he added with the touch of hu-
mor which characterizes his lectures,
“most of the colonies of the British
Empire are independent when there is
no tronhle about."

With the occupation of Shantnng,
Germany took a delayed hut positive
interest in the affairs of the East. The'
Emperor’s injunction to the new rul
of the territory, "Should anyone in}
fringe upon your 'ghts, use the mailr
ed fist and earn the laurel wreath" is
the policy which Germany followed in
all her external expansion.
