He went through the country audl‘

A college or university would not
think of placing gaudy signs about the
country but in many places the elfect

a student leaving for home with his

The person who is a college man, of

Throughout the year, the student

which it has cooperated, the various
classes working together for the com-
mon good of the school, Loyalty is
expected of every undergraduate,
even though it may find expression
in "crabbing". and this obligation does
not cease with graduation. Every
alumnus owes a duty to his college, a
duty not only of allegiance and sup-’
port in its undertakings, but a duty
of mental and verbal support. Featlty

is an important tactor in the regulai
