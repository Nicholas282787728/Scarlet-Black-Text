One Of the qualilties which 8. coin

lege avowediy instills in the mind of
the individual student is his iaculty
101' individual criticism, and on the
whole there seems no reason to at—
tack the train or thought which is
thus stimulated. However, it seems
that, like many other good things,
criticism is prone at times to fall into
a pathological condition in \vllich’the
critic looks at the world through

jaundiced eyes and as a consequence
endeavors to shroud both himself and

his friends in a cloud of gloom. This
type of critic was aptly described by
_ Addison when he said, "A critic is it

man who on all occasions is more 2117

is present." This is wintt we take the

privilege of calling destructive Cl'itir

which was expressed by Dryden in
