The SCARLET AND BLACK has recently received
some good criticism, which is solicited and printed ver-
batim. it has heeii called et'él'ﬂhiug hour a crah shoot
to a guﬂd paper, fur both 01 which names we thank the
critics.

Wc have been rather outspoken in our editorials
and we take secret joy ill feeling that some of our
shoes have been so designed as to lit. \Vc have with
uized not with the idea of hurting Griullell, but with that
Cit pointing out possible ways of benefiting general con-
ditions here. ‘Ve love the school as much as any one,
but we see no reason to shut our eyes when the bee
slings and murmur “isn’t it level In order to reduce
the swelling. The trouble with most college papers is
that they are filled with a lot of spineless palaver about
the beauties of the sunrise. “’0 Sometimes milks mis-
takes, it is true, but even city dailies are not illlallillle.

College and tho st'Anlm' AND BLACK as it newspaper
with that of all: other college and any other paper pull»

But holh have room tor improvement; it 's with this
in mind that we are orlcriug sonic New Year siggostioii..
We advocate lor is s and the years to, lollow;

1. Winning athletic teams, to be accomplished citllr
cr' through competing in coaching salni-ios or discon-
tinuing the contest schedules with schools so very much
larger than Crinncll. Silldcll - and teams tire ot moral
\ictories. |

2. A new ﬁeld housc, which might liclp the ahove.

3. Belicl‘ dramatic riicilitieson the Campus,

10. Active participation or the newly organized Pep

11. A limitation or student activities accol'dl‘ng to

12. A stress upon the gentlciuanly and lady—1' e

ncllian. '

13. An increase in chapel attendance. ‘

.14. A more pi-olcssional attitude toward study hoth
in the library and out of it. ,

15. T‘welvo o'clock hours for house party nights,
along with a continued liherul policy \concizl‘lliug all
social alrairs.

16. Abolition or recording cuts lor seniors.

17. A serious consideration of the advantages or the
quarter period system in place of the semester system
now prevailing. ‘ 41

Every year a nunilier of college freshmen display
their lack or sportsmanship at the opening basketllall
games by “honing" at the referee when he makes what
appears to he an unfair decision. It isn't being done in
the best regulated ianiilics and the team certainly does
not appreciate it.

America Discovered for $7200

Old records show that the cost of Columbus’ ﬁrst:
expedition to America amounted, in modem exchange,
to only $7200. ‘ To ﬁnance Columbus, Isabella,
Queen of Spain, offered to pawn her jewels. Today
word comes from Spain indicating that a twentieth
century importation from the new world is fast effect-
ing a sufﬁcient saving to ransom many royal jewels.
The Spanish Noﬁherrl Railway reparts that the
American equipment with which in 1924 the railroad
electriﬁed a mountainous section of its lines from Ujo
to Pajares has accomplished the following economies:
