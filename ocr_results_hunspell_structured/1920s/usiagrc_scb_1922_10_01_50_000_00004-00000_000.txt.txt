The Des Moines Club held their
ﬁrst "getatogethur" oi the year in the
form of an indoo)‘ picnic at the W0—
men's Gymnasium, on Saturday even—
ing. Fol'tysﬁve members, including
new and old students, enjoyed an in
iorrndl and pleasant time.

The program, in charge of Do Ai‘v
Barton, proved very amusing. An
impromptu debate, presented by
Francis Mullin, Lyrord Greene, Al-
bert Nicolette and Donald Clapp, on
the subject of “Whether a House Burns
Up 0]: Down,” afforded the judges the
task of a diiiicult decision. Mr. Cuff—
man, Mrs. Cline and Miss catell ad-
judged both teams victors.

A group of songs were given by
ﬁve at the Freshmen girls, and
speeches delivered by other members
of the organization.

The officers for the year are
Esther Greene, President, Junior
Wood, Secretary, and DeAi‘V Barton.
Social Chairman. It will be neces
sary for a new treasurer to be elected
for this coming term.

The organization will take an act-
ive part in Grlnnell social life this
year, and promises many interesting
entertainments in the future.

Because of this the total cost or the_

or what a set would cost at retail.
The only plans which he had in
building this cliicient‘outlit were
drawn on the backs of two

REV. CARMAN TALKS
IN CHAPEL FRIDAY

Says Man Who Is Satisﬁed With
Present Conditions Is Dead.

“The possessions 0[ today should
not cheat us out of the possibilities cl
tomorrow," said Rev. Cal-man oi the
First Baptist church, in speaking in
rhapcl Friday morning.

He went on to say that the real
sense or humor is the element or in-
congruity mixed with tho element of
surprise. Many people are humorous
in this respect on- they are always
wasting their energy on incongruous
and out-ot-the-way things that have
no permanent effect. He believes too
many peolo have lost their mental bals
ancc in life and go seeking after the
unsiablc and temporary.

“Turn your cliorts in the right
way," said Rev. Carman, . "The old
adage ‘a bird in die hand is worth
two in the bush’ is‘ one of tho ralscst
maxims ol today. It cheats us out of
the potential possibilities oi tomor-
Tow."

He brought out the fact that any
man who is satisﬁed with his present
condition. no matter how good it may
be, is dead. it is those who are not
saticsﬁcd with the present state of
affairs but dosire to get the two birds
in the bush as Well as the one in the
hand that succeed and keep the old
world moving.

Now is the dangerous period of life
when one is forming habits and

rounding nuthis character, (or lbssc‘

will direct his course and remain with
him all through life,

fesso!‘ and Mrs. G. I2. Pierce returned ,
