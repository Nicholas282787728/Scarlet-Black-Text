Juniors and Sophomores Tie for
Second With One Game Won
And One Lost.

SEREEs PART or PROGRAM

Intramural Department Will Give
Medals to Members of
Winning‘ Team.

A win from the juniors Thursday
and another from the seniors yesterr
day gave the yearling basketball team
a lead ill the inter-class basketball
meet. The juniors and sophomores
each have won» and let a game and
the seniors have yet to break into tlle
winning column.

The frosh road to victory had rits
rocky places. A 19 to 11 victory over
the juniors on Thursday indicated an
easy game with the seniors who had
fallen before the Sophs 36 to 16 How-
ever, after a pom" shelving in the
first half, the seniors staged a rally
which put them Within three points of
victory. Hallstead led the last minutc
attack with ‘five baskets from the mid
dle of the liner. Struble gave sup-
port in the shape of three baskets and
some close guarding.

, Juniors L'psrt Sophomores.

Perhaps the biggest upset of the
meet came when the class oi '23 hand-
ed the sophomores a ii to 18 defeat
aiter a mediocre showing against the
freshmen the night before. The game
was clearly the juniors‘ from the
start. They piled up a load in the
iirst half and added to it the rest of
the game. Not so much as a two mim
ute rally marred the game. De Long.
whose dizzy shots the previous day
had brought seventeen points, wasn't
dizzy yesterday. He scored only six
points and at the same time brought
three personal fouls to his team. Gray,
the junior captain, was the heavy scor-
er of the battle, making twelve points.
'tl‘lcCully and Evahn of the Gray Co~
horts crashed through with twelve
more counters between them.

Frosh Substitutes Freely.

The freshmen play has been marked
by free substitutions. Coach Watt
used two combinations about an equal
length or time. The first, consisting
of Miner at one forward and Minier at
the other, Humphrey at center and
Ferguson and Captain Douglas at
guards. perhaps played the better
brand oi basketball. This was the team
which piled up a ten point lead in the
first half oi the senior game which
thc other team nearly lost in the See-
and period. Minler and Humphrey
are the heavy scorers of the combina-
atlon because of their size. Douglas is
a strong back guard who occasionally
comes forward to make a basket. With
the aid of Ferguson, he held the jun-
iors to two points in the iirst hair of
that game and did similar work in the
initial half of the senior battle. .lliner
shoots baskets occasionally, but his
chief work is “feeding" the ball to his
taller teammates.

The tournament is sponsored by the
intramural department which, for the
first time, is giving medals to the win-
ning five, Coaches Watt and Duke air
ternated as referees and Elton Follet
was the tournament manager.

Anatomists Enjoy Hollow Laughter
At Annual Grim “Feast of Skulls”

On the third tloor of an ancientrm-
tradition Science building on Decemr
ber 15. 1927, twenty Grinnell anatom—
istS gathered for their annual ”Feast
oi Skulls.” At exactly a quarter past
Six, tlle door to the dimly lighted
chamber opened and a score of tutr
urc doctors, led by Fl-oiessor Norris
tiled in. ,

At the door the men were greeted by
a skeleton with an arm uproised in
greeting. Undaunted, however, and
perhaps obsessed with the idea or read,
they pushed on to iind two long tablcs
set in banquet style and strown with
skulls. The room was decorated with
uighthnwk owls, turtles, crabs, and
stuiied ummnls, each being signifi-
cantly named ror a member of the
gathering. Soon, however, the place
cards were located and each sat down
to race the bony remains oi what once
was a human head. In the south win-
dow an lllumcd skull glared across
the campus. Whilc waiting to be ser-

 

ved, Professor Norris pointed out gap-
ing bullct holes in the heads of several
of the ccnter-picces which wcre evir
dcntly suicides.

Thc dinner progressed with spark-
ling wit which, to thc onlookcr, would
have seemed far out of tune with the
surrounding environment. Several of
the guests experienced impious satiss
faction by clicking together the jaws
of the dciunct skoltons in rhythm with
tho mastication or their neighbors.

The climax oi the evening occurred
when Proicssor Norris presented lllr
Bamher with his doctor’s degree for
having iinally iound, after many years
or research, a “mean worm." lllr. 13am.
her iorthwith read his thesis, which al-
though a bit colloquial in spots. was
acclaimed by all a masterpicce 0! Sci—
cutiiic research.

The lights grew dim, the meeting
adjourned, and the annual Christmas
dinner of the Class or Comparitive
Anatomy was over.

“MUST HAVE NEW
VIEW”—STOOPS

Liberal Illtonll'etatrion Of Christ All":
.. able For Students.

“No one could [ollow all the teach-
illgs ascribed to Christ without being
regarded as quccl- today," Saill Pro! J.
D. Stoops in his talk on "Christianity”
which he gave at the Y, M. C. A. meet
ing held in the Clark hall elubroom,
Thursday evening.

Mr. Stoops maintained that the than
coming to college with implicit belief
in the literal interpretations of Christ's
teachings had the problem of adjust-
ing his ideas to fit in with the less
orthodox views of his companions.

The Professor said that there were
four types of religion; the religion at
Jesus, the religion of Paul, the Myer

Brilliant Offensive In
Pioneer Rallies.

In one or the fl'eest scoring clinics
cvcr witnessed in Missouri Valley has-
ketball, Grinnell college was dete‘ltell
by the Oklahoma Aggies last night.
The score was 54 to 43. Both teams
played a scintillating offense but a
ragged defense.

The Pioneers were behind most of
the game but the margin between the
two teams was never secure. The
score at the end oi the first half was
28 to 18 in favor or the Cowboys, but
a determined rally, led by Fail and
Lovcjoy oi the Pioneers, put the Iowa
team into the running again,

Game Is Rnggcdi'

The game was a typical early season
game, many shots were made when
the guards were out of position, and
many easy shots were missed by both
teams.

Wright of the Cowboys was the high
point man obthe game with seventeen
points as a result of eight field goals
and opc free throw. King and Col-
lins, also of the Aggies, each sank
seven field tosses, while Coggeshall
was high point man for the invaders
with eleven points as a result at four
field tosses and three gilt baskets.
