(sin interview with Prof. c. m. Payne)

The Baldwinministry in England
has brought in a program for the sate-
guarding ot the Industries Act which
indicates that the extreme protection—
ﬁsts in the Liberal party have been
defeated. The program does not in—
clude the adoption of a policy oi proe
tection, but simply provides that any
industry suttering from abnormal
competition with other industrial
countries can apply for protection. But
the industry must prove its case
before a series or commissions and
governmental departments, which will
make protection extremely difficult to
secure

It must be remembered that 90 p
cent at the people who live in Great
Britain ﬁve in towns and cities; that
they are dependent npommanutactun
ing and industrial life, and that they
have for many years stood tor a pol—
icy or free trade. In 1923 the county
overwhelmingly committed
free trade, and Mr. Churchill, who
.seelns to be all-powerful in the cab-
inet, is devoted to that cause. In the
last election, in November, Baldwin
deﬁnitely promised that there would
be no resort to protection. 50 the
alarms of the Labor and Liberal par—
ties seem to have been without founda-

tion.

The French treasury is being strain—
ed by the iacfthat large liabilities are
falling due at the some time that in-
tel-nil borrowing is very _difficult.

In the midst or this tinancial crisis.
Joseph Caillaux is coming back into
politics. it will he remembered that
during the war he was tried for trees

from political lile. The present gov—
ernment has removed the him and
permitted hiln to return, and El. ~ few
days ago he was given a banquet by
over two thousand people, which was
also attended by hundreds oi deputies
of the Chamber of Deputies. His
speech is regarded as a bid for a re

minister oi France; and as he is call-
sidel‘ed by many the foremost finan-
cier of France. it is by no means (I.
remote possibility that he will come

in bi. speech in. caillaur attributed
the political disorder and iinanolal dif—
ﬁculties or France to Poincare, and
announced his loyalty to the present
government. As financial remedies
he declared that the budget would
have to be balanced, and direct taxc

the policy or the extension at thc
debt.

The present French government has
within the last few days completed a
means vivendi, or temporary nine
months’ agreement with Germany,
lowering tariffs between the two coun»
tries, to be followed later by a perm-

observers think this situation will lead
to n political understanding, and that
the much debated question or French
security will be obtained in this way
rather than through a military tax or
lany kind.

France tears that in case at war, not

The last week has been marked by
the death of two \vorltl-[ztlllolls tig—
ures, Premier Emitting or Sweden and
President Ebert or Germany.

organize labor as a political party in
