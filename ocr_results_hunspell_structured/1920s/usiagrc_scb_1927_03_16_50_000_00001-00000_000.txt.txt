when they trumped over the Muudt

FIVE DAYS LEFT UNTIL SEASON
0F PROPOSALS AND DISPOSALS

 

Spring is here. one sees it on every
hand; the grass is greening, the tiles
are [lying and the birds birding.
Laziness and laxness go hand in hand
with the merry little spring zephyl-s,

I have observed and as I informed
you some time [last that it would be
my business to tell you what I have
seen, I begin. Grrlunell is a great
college, of course that iS Well knownY
but it has been my misfortune to see
that she has neglected her student
body's etiquette. A reversion to the
primitive is practically in store for
Joe Student and his sister Coed, and
sometimes the girl is not his sister

The terllble disease of elbows has
caused more to be stricken than the

terrible ravager. the flu. Elbows on
the table, elbows on the chairs, in fact
elbows everywhere.

To thc observer it is at once evident
that spring weather has affected Joe
Student so that he clings tenacicnsly
to his chair evcu when his sister or
the other girl stands chairless.

Men seem to be hard to get in this
day of easy divorce, and the women or
Grinhell have a way of hanging on to
their escort in the day time that rivals
even tho tabled strangle hold of the
octopus. -

Spring is in the air. rive more
days of winter and then the season of
proposals and disposals will be at
hand. A

these two games.

Already having won two of the ma-
jor indoor meet shot events, Rillelol't

ill invade the southland with an out—
standing reputation as one of the best
shot and discus men in college circles
this season. Although his mark in the
Missouri v llcy meet in Des Moines
last week was not within ‘a foot or his
toss at the Illinois relays, the Pioneer
track leader is e. ected to near his
Kansas meet record of 48 feet, 2 in—
ches in the two Texas meets.

lieluling Meets

The Rice games at Houston March
25, are recognized as being in the
class with the Texas relays which are
held in Austin the -lollcwing day.
Practically the some men perform in
each meet, and with the favorable
weather that is generally present in
the Lone Star state at this time of
year, good marks are usually rung up
in all events,

Contrary to reports circulated by
several press associations the first
not
compete in the Negro Danie indoor
meet Saturday. e Pioneer oilicials
deemed it wise to let be big fellow
rest after a fairly str nuous indoor
season, and to devote a considerable
part of his time to the discus. Last
season “Moeo” tossed the plattcr
beyond the Ito—foot mark on several
occasions and will, no doubt, pass
that mark this year. ~

With every week a busy one for the
Maltese track men after the Home
meet April 16, Coach Duke will soon
be working his men in overtime
shifts The track is drying rapidly
and it is expected to be in fair shape
for rolling soon. With a little warm
Vealller, and some heavy contribu—
tions by Jupiter Pluvius, the Ward
field oval should be in fine shape for
all the meets this season.

The Kansas and Drake relays will
follow each other on successive Week
ends this year. providing a little trav—
eling for the, squad: Crinuell is so-
creditedmith one Kansas meet rec-
ord, that by Captain Rineiort, who
tossed the shot the considerable dis—
tance of ill-feet 2 1-2 inches in the
carnival last spring. The mark will
no doubt be threatened, and perhaps
broken by the big boy this season.

Strong in Ilcluys

Although not pdrt‘eularly strong in
the running events this year, the
Pioneer cinder men may place in fair ,
order in thermile and twormile relays. '
A sizeable Suuitd of quarter milers are
reporting to Coach Duke, and these
men may form it dangerous quartet at
the mile distance. Rlneiort iS counted
on to do well in the shot and discus,
special events on tlie,program and
may win both. _

Iowal State teachers college is a.
newcomer to recent Grinnell track
schedules, but will bring a team in
Grinnell that boasts of several stellar
performers in some of the events.
This should be a meet that will go to
the credit side of the Pioneer sched-
ule, however. ,
