By winning from Building III the

Clark hall aggregation jumped into
the lead for the championship. Al-
though either team was given a chance
to come out with the long end or the
score, it was not expected that the
Clarksters would win by such a decis-
ive score. Captain “Pinky” Culvcr's
men had a decidedly oft day and did
not display the championship form
that they showed in their first can-
test. Their fielding was raggd and
they tailed to come through with some
heavy stick work. On the other hand
the Clarkstcrs supported Morris in
big league style and clouted Heivitt's
