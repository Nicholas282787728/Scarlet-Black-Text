Up the Program.

The women's annual Physical Edu-
cation demonstration takes place
promptly at eight o'clock Saturday ev—

tume dances, drills, a ten minute game
of exhibition basketball, and the hal-
let, “The Quest of the lirebird" coni-
prise the major part of the program.

Members of freshmen and sophp~
more classes will take part in the
drills and costume dances while the
ballet features the work of the aide
vanced dancing classes. The exhibi-
tion basketball is a new feature of the
demonstration. The contest between
two picked allrclass teams will be

short but sufficient to illustrate the -

differences, both in rules and execu-

tion between men's and women’s bas-

ketball and to furnish comparison,
Russian legend furnishes lmllet

The ballet, “The Quest of the Fire-
bird," is based upon an old Russian
legend. The theme denls with -the
winning of the Princess hand by one
of four princes, \l’hose adventures in
an effort to bring back the prized fea-
thers of the Firebird are portrayed in
the successive movements of the hal-
let. The music by such Russian com»
posers as Tchaikowsky, Rubenstein,
Karganoff, Rebilwif, Kovestchenko,
and Drigo is a feature which adds

ATMOSPHERE IS IMPORTANT

Roles Mostly Carried in Convincing
ll‘nsllinn: Allusions Destroyed
Occasionally.

By w. H. Hack

Any proper appreciation of the_per‘-
formauce by the college Dramatic
club last Saturday evening of Sutton
Vane's "Outward Bound” should take
into account the inherent defects of
the play itself as well as the difficult-
ies of presentation in the high school
auditorium.

Sitting somewhat under the gallery
at the presentation last fall of “Mr.
Pim Passes By," ‘Lhe present writer
was' able to catch only the high points
of the dialogue; last week in the
eighth row from the front, certain
parts of the first act, as the early
speeches of Mrs. Cliveden Banks, for
example, could be understood only
with considerable effort. As the
nervousness oi the players wore off,
however, the carrying power of their
voices improved.

Tone All-important

Perhaps a word might be inserted
here concerning the bearing of voice
upon atmosphere and characterization.
One might almost say that in mat-
ters of art, atmosphere or tone is all-
important. Some chapel speeches and
prayers, some people who read poetry
and some who play in plays, succeed
in str ing just the right note and in
creating an appropriate atmosphere
by a voice attuncd to the matter of
the moment. A convincing, recent
example was the recital in Herrick
chapel of Mr. Sandburg,

In the second and third acts of
"Outward Bound,” in spite of thc
beartlcssness of Mrs. Cliveden Banks
and the loud desire of Lingiey of Lingr
ly, Limited to get down to a cold bus-
iness proposition, the necessary at-
mosphere, it would seem. would be
one of almost speechless terror in-
stead oi the boisterous thing it too
frequently was.

Is Over-Violent

From ‘the point of view just outlin-
ed even Hawthorne Axey’s fine im-
personation of the amiable and mag~
netic but all too convivial Tom Prior
suffered at time from an over vio-
lence of voice and manner which tend-
ed to destroy the illusion of the char
acter and the seriousness of the situ-
ation.

with practically every mun who w 1
be at home for the vacation enlisted
and the cooperation of several hun-
dred alumni in Iowa‘ and adjacent
states, the movement toward enlarg~
ing still further the enrollment of
men at Grinnell is gaining headway
every day, Beginning last Sunday a
series of house-meetings has been held
at which the general features of the
movement have been freely discussed,
and the methods of cooperation with
the alumni explained by the alumni
secretary, Mr. H. W. Matlack. Each
man has received a copy of the new
hand-book, “Facts about Grinncll,"
which has been prepared specially for
this purpose.

It has been estimated that nearly a
thousand high-school senior men leave
Iowa every year to attend college
somewhere else. It is also stated that
many high school seniors attend uni-
versities who should be in a liberal
arts cullege. Altogether nearly ten
thousand men graduate iron. Iowa
high schools every year. With this
field to draw from, in the opinion of
those who have made a study of the
situation, Grinnell's advantages as a
liberal arts college ought to bring all
the men students that campus and
town can take care of.

Accommodations Al'nili‘ible

The enrollment of men {it Grinncll
has increased forty per cent in the
last few years. The dormitories,
which accommodated fewer than two
hundred men when they were built,
now house nearly ‘tlto illiildl'cd find

tions in private homes for more than

One of the interesting features of the
enrollment the past few years has
been the increase in ‘the number of
men from neighboring and even from
distant parts of the Unltcd States.
Grinncll now has a larger percentage
of students from outside its home
state than any college in Iowa, and
most. of the distant students are men.

lese of Large Program

The present movement is one phase
of a larger program undertaken by
student and alumni organizations
looking toward increasing Gl'innell's
lead as at college for men. This pro»
gram includes the strengthening of all
men: organizations, the further de-
velopment of the men’s social life in
the dormitories, encouragement of
high scholastic standing, and all the
way through a steady emphasis on
the men's side of campus life.

Many coeducational colleges show a
tendency to become women's colleges
with an annex for men, the percentage
of men at Qherlin for instanceyhéwlns'
been at one time within recent years
almost down to thirty per cent, and
although it is not as low as that at
present it is still far below Grinnell's.
Northwestern university hits also felt
the necessity of taking special steps
to keep a fair percentage of men.
Grinneil this year has 45 per cent of
men, which is above the average for
coeducational colleges in general. It
is the intention of thc college to carry-
on this movement until the enrollment
inclit of men at Grinnell reaches at
least 55 per cent of,tiie total enroll—
merit.

Such was the action of four faculty

the Inferior court of Gl'lllllell.

Professor Ryan was much disturbed
until he found that it was a charge
other than for speeding.

TWO SOLOISTS ON PROGRAM

By Max Daehler

The opportunity of bearing sym-
phonic muslc in Grinnell, in itself is
an event of unusual interest. For the
most part it seems to remain the ex-
clusive privilege of the large city and
only on rare occasions a concert of
such highly artistic merits as the St.
Louis Symphony Orchestra offered
Tuesday evening, comes to bring joy
to the music lovers of the smaller
community. As one of the country's
noted organizations it sounded the
stirring message of the best symphonic
music, the climax of instrumental art.

Under the remarkable leadership of
Rudolph Gain the orchestra shows a
new and higher standard of excellence
year after year. Their technical pro-
[lciency now unites these musicians ‘to
a perfect ensemble. The brass section
particularly attains a purer, more per-
fect tone, blending beautifully into
the whole. '

Hove lihythniicol Unity

The rhythmical unity in this body
of players also was one of the de-
lights of the concert. Then again the
various solo instruments, which in
tum had important parts intrusted to
[hell], showml excellent qualities. Dur-
ing last nights concert we noticed
particularly a beautiful tone in oboe
and ham.

Rudolph Ganz is a. fascinating lead-
er, who knows how to impart his own
enthusiasm to his players. His strong
sense for dynamic values brought a
dramatic force to his readings, in
which a spirited discipline was hap-
[lily Combined with perfect freedom of
expression.

Audience Surprised

Two surprises were announced dur-
ing the evening: Micheal Gusikoff.
cancertmasterof the orchestra, and
Amie Pnnshon, a St. Louis singer, both
were to assist as soloists, instead of
Kathryn Browne.

Mr. Gusikoff played ,tne last two
movements of Mendelssohn's violin
concerto in lovely manner. An excep—
tional purity of tone and a fleet. clear
technic are the outstanding qualities
of his work.

. Miss Pilnchon possesses a charming
mezzo-soprano voice of unusually
beautiful timbre. Her gracious man»
here at once made her a favorite with
the audience and she sung as sh on-
core Rnchmaninufl’s ”0, Silent Night."
