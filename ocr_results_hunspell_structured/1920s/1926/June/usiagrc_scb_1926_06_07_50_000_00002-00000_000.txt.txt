THE BLUEBIRD

In Mexico, romantic land of pretty senorltas
and languorous minstrelsy, practical American
engineers have harnessed streams so that moun-
tains may be leveled.

 

The winding thirty-mile Maltrata incline on the
road from Vera Cruz to Mexico City is now elec-
triﬁed. Ten electric locomotives replace twenty
three steam engines. The electrics haul twice the
tonnage of the steam locomotives—arid in half
the time, with obvious beneﬁts to traveler, rail-
roader, and shipper.
