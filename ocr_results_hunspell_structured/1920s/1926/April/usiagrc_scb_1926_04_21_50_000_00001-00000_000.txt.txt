‘ The stage is very much in period
with jutting wings and old-time Fool—
lights that stick up enough to slightly
ohstrriot the view. The jutting wings
provide hidden entrances and the
actors seemingly leave and enter
through the wall. ‘

The play is so well east that there
can hardly be said to be stars or fav—
orites. Mr. Giliillan as the- poet, is
perfect. bliss Sadgent as Prudence,
the lady who has spent a very long
maidenhead in quest of a husband,
could not be improved, upon, The
obvious iviles of bliss Eager as the
good old—fashioned .coquette are sure
to delight the audience.

Actors Ail ions

Miss Andersen, Mr. Faglly-Cole, and
fur Boem, who have the heaviest parts
are perhaps most an bus for time
for the curtain to use When one
knows something of the lines they are
to speak he shares the enthusiasm.

lfr. Eeem plays the honest old far-
mer, who is a dyed-in-the-wool moral—
ist. i-le renders his little sermons in
ponderous, sohorous tones.

"Fashion? And pray what is fashr
ion. madam? An agreement between
certain persons to live witrout using
their soulsiio substitute etiquette for
virtueidecorum for purity—manners
for morals: To effect a shame for the
works of their cdeator and expend all
their rapture upon their tailors and
dress-makers."

Later in the play he says to the gen—
tle Gertrude, "Never tell a lie.

Miss Andersen as Mrs. Tiffany.

Count “You American women are
quite charming, yet, demme, there's a
deal of native rust to iub off!”

Mrs. Tiffany (looking around the
room): “Rust? Good Gracious, Count,
where do you find any rust?”

The manner in which the count gives
away his true character is quite
splendidly that of the old-time villain.

Mrs. Tiffany: “I blush to confess
that I have never tl'avelelliwllile you,
Count, I presume are at home in all

Grilll‘iell's two representatives at

points betiveen them to place the Sal‘s

many schools represented by a far
greater number of men. roster Riiie-

points. A first in the discus by Rine»

Meeter, and a second in the shot by
Itinefort were the places taken by the
Grinnell pair.

In coppingtlie discus, Rinefort heav-
ed the platter a distance of 138 feet.
This mark is an inferior one for the
big junior, for he has already thrown
the plate in the neighborhood of 150
feet. bleeter's mark of 129 feet shows
an improvement over his last year's
performances. Ten feet more can he
expected of “Butch” this season, as

able of that distance by consistently

Business ﬂlulijnliiliTalk

Mr. Albert J. Robertson, vice-presi-
dent of the Iowa National Bank of
Des Monies. spoke to the Business
club in the club-room of Dibble hall,
Sunday afternoon, on the subject of
bonds. Mr, Robertson is head of the
bond department of the Iowa National
Bank and has been in the game for
ten or twelve years.

He spoke of the bond business in
general and of the prospects of col—
lege men in that field, enumerating
the attributes of a good bond sales-
man. He criticized the courses that
have been offered to college men in
the past, in preparation for bond sell»
ing and highly recommended a liberal
arts education as the best preparation.

In describing the bond expert of the
future, he prophesied that such a man
would probably be the best authority
available for all types of money in.
vesting problems. Just as people we
day place their legal disputes in the
hands of a lawyer, they will in the
future place their investing problems
in the hands of a competent bond
broker.
