Though not so flamboyant as the

The scientizic method of thought,
void of sentimentality us it is, has
been successfully applied by college
people to mathematics, biology and
the various curricular courses but it
has not yet been put to a fair test
between individuals. It is still a
risky business for a person to speak
what he thinks sentiment may

his utterances have been analyzed,
