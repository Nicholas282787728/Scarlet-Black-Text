II; a. llci-lirrt liniglit

In tiie making of a program eCeCr
tieism is an excellent thing, and Miss
Esther Dale was evidently determined
to exploit its excellence to the full in
the song recital she gave last night in
Her ck chapel

While her program did not include
a pale excerpt irom the standardized
operatic repertoire, it did embrace
and exemplify practically all the oth-
er known forms of the vocal art from
the coloratura “Lusillghe piii care" of
Handel's to the urn ss and irrespousr
ble yet most effective Irish follirsong
“I Know Where I'm Goill'.” That
. iss Dale's program did, at all times,
interest an attentive audience is be-
yond question. but that it plumbed
the emotional depths with that fie-
ouency essential to the ideallyebale
anced program, is a premise that can-
not be so readily assinued or concede
ed.

Audience “'ns- .ipprrclativc

At all times adaptable and persuas
ive in the exercise of her art, and
manifestly impeccable in the matters
of phrasing and breath control, Miss
Dale scalcs heights reached by but
few other concert artists when she
sings songs hating the pinnant delr
caey or Schumann’s “driftrage” or Der
llussy’s “Fantoches.” Indeed, so
gratiaiing was Miss Dale’s perform
ance of these songs last night, that
had it been in the power of the itutlir
ence to request their repetition, that
request would have been .made and
voiced vociferously.

In the third part oi her program
. iss Dale grouped together a niim 31‘
ot Irish, English and Afro-American
follirsongs. in response to the in»
sistent applause following the singing
oi this group or songs, Miss Dale
sang the now well—known and per-
haps a little trite Irish folk»song"’l‘he
Londonderry Air." Highiy elfectlve
as were all these songs as interpret—
ed by Miss Dale, the native simpiliety
and charm of two of the. songs was
somewhat jeopardized last night by
the unsuitabllity and extravagance of
the harmhnles written for the ac—
companying instrument,

M . Jackson at Piitlw

iliss Dale’s final group of songs in-
cluded ‘Ernest Walker's charm ig
"Showdl‘ops" and Mr. Carpenter s
richly—exotic "Light, my Light."

Assisting Miss Dale at the piano
was Miss Lillian Jackson, who,
throughout the evening, was an alert
and conscientious coadiutor.

Ul fol-ml, lligll Stnnllnl‘ll ill
Current ISSIlc.

By Curti Lamb

In all fairness to him who writes
criticism oi the month's Grmllell
Tanager, there should be an editor's
note explaining that the author is not
a member of the Tanager editorial
etatf and lurtber, that be is not der
sirons of having a particular eontrr'
bution accepted by the magazine.
Moreover, it should he affirmed that
the writer is not a member of the
Tanager business staff, crud has not
been bribed by the business managerl
to advertise the January issue.

Preface including these remarks
seems necessary in view or the lead
to this story which is: With but tew
reservations, I believe the current
Tanager number well worth reading
from the Goudy Hand-tooled type
newly selected for the front cover to
the closing announcement of a Tnnrtr
ger poetry prize,

“Sister Aimee" Is Good

That the January issue or the Tari-
ager would not be suppressed despite
the medicated publication in it ot an
article on "Sister Aimee" McPherson,
was the gist ot a news story carried
in the Scarlet and Black a week ago.
The story proved more than a clever
advertising stunt; it introduced to the
public that contribution which is at
once the most sensational and yet
the most humorous article printed in
the magazine since the reorganizate
tion,

Appreciation of Mr, Moore's style
need be gaged by no other criterion
than the number of chuckles per page.
Speaking oi Aimee's message, he says,
“It is shot tliroiigb and through with
the old time religion—she would ratl —
er save your soul than your peace oi
mind. if God lags behind and
becomes careless, Aimee rushes in and
beats the victims at the devil on their
religious solar plexus until they fall
hentitent at her feet."

Seymour liollnus Sandburg

So consciously impressionistic
George Steele Seymour, iounder oi
the Order of Booklellou-s, in the
group of poems he contributes, that I
dm tempted to label the r sult, ”liter-
ary cxel' e." Writing alter the style
of Carl Sandburgas portrayed in such
a poem as “Nocturll in a Deserted
Iii-ickyir .. Seymour versiiies his
thoughts on subjects such as the "Fills
ing Station," ”Car Trucks” and “Motor
Cars." The best or the group, ”or
lice Buildings," describes the ”City's
opera oi steel."

More classical in treatment is the
poem. “A Birch in Autumn,” by Mir-
iam llcNally. When the ancient
Greeks conceived of a beaiitilnl u -
man. they nlwa s thought at fair
sliapcd arms. So too, Miss McNally,
observes the "shining arms" as well
as the 'saucy laughter" of the birch
in autumn.

lll lliis- Gerri

"1 consider teaching -t as great a
calling as a public cnrecr," Miss Es~
tliei- Dale said in speaking or her
combined career as a vocal professor
and concert singer. “However, I do
not belicie that a singer can handle
both a teaching and public career
successiully, Some histruuicntalists
find it possible to do both but it is a
ditfcrcnt matter when one'S whole be.
mg is connected with it as in sing
lug." The approach which Miss Dale
took to the concert stage was via the
church choir and college; she was
nor several years proicssor oi vocal
music at Smith college and Mount
Holyoke.

“I loved my teaching at Smith and
left it with reluctance, as the trainih"
of young voices was fascinating wo
to me I discontinued teaching be-
cause I Ielt that i had come to the part.
ing of the w , ; that I could not ,
on teaching and still have the public
career for which i had planned since
I started singing. It is impossible
with an exacting college schedule to
set any distance away from it.”

llrciiul program similar

The school of music at Smith, Miss
Dale explained, has a recital program
similar to the one in use at G nnell.
There is a laclllty recital or , \Ved—
nesday alternoon as each pm on cone
nected with the school of music is e-
pected to give two recitals a yea
There are also monthly student re-
citals and a senior and orchestra i-
cital in the spring. “I was of course
eager and :ill\iolls to sing while at
Smith," M s Dale said, "and often
took the solo part in
which were given in conJllllctioll with
Amherst, I feel that my career us

In teacher contributed u great deal to

my knowledge of music and to my.
cess as a concert singer."
Miss Dalc said that she liked to ap-

pcarbefore college audiences. “I have‘

often hea‘rd musicians who came to

Smilll remark that they would with:

or appear before college audiences
than any other, Then the met that

ed in or studying foreign languages

teel‘

and the Romance tongues and
that some group is understanding
what one is trying to do, I always
give my best program before a col-
lege audience."
Prclcrs Career or Recimlisl

nlthough Miss Dale is termed a
prime donna soprano she has not
sung in opera. The term prima donna
was applied to her five years ago by
critics in recognition at her all~

the matches ‘

around ability. M'ss Dale
credited by the or ice with having
great dumatic ability and tempera:
ment suitable to the operatic role,
preiers the career or recitalist, “I
chose to bc a concert singer because
the art 01' a recital a line and My
duisite one. It is a far more severe
test at ability than the opera, as the
singer alone on the stage must needs
createbackground and settingns well
as the song itself," "Al. that," she
added with charming candor and sim-
plicity, "there are more disappointed
people in opera than in any other Dru~
lession,"

Mis Dale has only recently returm
ed trom a tour of England, France,
Germany and Italy. “I iound a lively
ciirio ty regarding American singers.
This is partly due to the fact thatnot
veri- many American recitalists go
abroad, in recent years there have
been only three. Alina Case, Giannini,

Miss Dale is perhaps more com.
bletcly “American” than a other
singer who has recently visited Eur,
ope. Her fanii ~ i. . w England
Alllerlcan ii-om the ronrth gcneration,
although she was born in Beaufor.‘
south Carolina She started study-
ing music at seven and made her lirst
appearance in New York at the age of
seventeen. Recent American oping
ion may be summed up in the com-
ment of the Los Angeles Times on her
, Hollywood Bowl concert: ”Miss Dale
established herself iii the Minds or all
her listeners as a singer with a voice
of lovely quality and mental equipr
ment necessary to an artist of the
first rank, Her simplicity and grac-
iousness or manner was a matter or
pride for every American born music
lover in the audience."

While abroad, Miss Dale was elect-
ed national chairman of the Music
Forum, organized by the American
League of Professional Women to pros
mote a nationwide campaign for bet»
,ter music. Her leadership in Am

FORENSIC DEBATES
DEMOCR‘ATIC GOV

Pnplllnl- Gnvcrnlneni Is hiscnssed at
01ml! Meeting in Clark Hill].

“Democracy is a failure because it
has not reached in any country the
high goal it set for itseli," according
to the aiiirmative arguments in a de-
bate on the question of democracy, at
an open meeting of Grinnell Forensic
Wednesday evening. Concediug that
the ideals of democracy as expressed
by Abraham Lincoln are desirable to
attain, the affirmative speakers, John
Martin, John Spencer and Donald
Reid, nevertheless maintained that
the people do not rule today. Rather
the trend is toward the leadership of
strong men, such as Mussolini has
given to Italy. ‘

Speaking on the other side of the
question, Emerson Schill, Clarence Ja-
cohson and Robert hurlingame admit-
ted that democrary has not worked
pcrlectly, They cited history to prove
that other lorms of government have
failed in the past, and contended that
governments based on Mussolini’s
plan are failing today. Democracy is
"the only tom of government thathas-
worked with any success, and al-
though imperfect, it is constantly im-
proving, and otters the only hope for
world betterment.

The next meeting or Forensic will
be a dinner party at the Hotel Mon-
roe, given by Protessor G. Herbert
Knight tollowing the Christmas vaca-
tion.
