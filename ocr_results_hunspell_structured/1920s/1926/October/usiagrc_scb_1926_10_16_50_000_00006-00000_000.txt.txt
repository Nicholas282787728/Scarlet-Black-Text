the international Journal or Ethic by
the associate editor, Dr. T v. Smith,
of the Uiiivei :ty of Chicago.

The thesis of the book is based on
the application to ethics at some at the
insights or Freudian psychology. says
Dr. Smith. From the assumption that
satisfactory liiing requires a continu-
ous release of energy upon demand or
environment, Professor Stoops des-
cribes in its various stages the results

lhow ill the individual the process of
release is observable at one extreme

treme iii a type of insanity, Between
these extremes individuals may be
classified by the relative degree or ex-

Professor Stoops has made his
treatment or the individual experience
very complete, says Dr. Smith, and has
brought in a wealth or material from
the whole history of civilization. In
conclusion, Dr. Smith comments upon
the atmosphere of high seriousness
which pervades the book, together
with the hope that it will dignity the
study of ethics in the estimation of
students.
