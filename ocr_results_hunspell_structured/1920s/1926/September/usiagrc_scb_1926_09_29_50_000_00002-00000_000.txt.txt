MAKE MANY SUBSTITUTIONS

Pioneers Tail To Show Class During
Second Period; Offensive Locks
Drive nod right.

(By Myron Burt)
The Pioneers ‘opened their season
last Saturday with n 2070 victory over
The day

special train was chartered Grinnell
footers made themselves known in the
Penn stadium, At all [lines through
out the game, players as well as spec.
tators seemed ‘to be confident that

,'Grilmell would have the long end of
‘ the score. This attitude slowed up the

game at stages and made the Grinnell
defense seem rather weak, especially
the offensive. ifeeter came up to ex-
pectations as a man who can drive
through the line. McClain, the scrap-
py end of last season, played his usu<
at strong defensive game at his old
position and showed up well as a fast
back in the offensive.
Stotts Sms

west Stotts was the outstanding star
of the game and proved beyond a.
doubt that he has lost nDue of'rhis
ability to return punts, He also Went
through the line and around the ends
for substantial gains, his speed,
change of pace and stiff—arm making
him dangerous in an open field. All
three touchdowns were scored by
Stotts, two through the line and one

. when he returned a punt from" Crin-

Dell’s to yard line after he had made
things look bad for three Penn tack~
lers, and then behind sweeping inter-
ference easily negotiated the last 35
yards. 'Both Meeter and McLain got
off some good punts, Meeter having a
slight edge, although both seemed
rather slow in getting the ball into

a the air as Penn men were dangerously

close to the kicker on almost every
attempt Meeter's placements were
good onough. Many substitutions were
made and bomb, Duke and Spencer
proved that although Crinncl's squad
is small there are more than eleven
:men of real football ability in suits.
Gﬁnnell Scores Two

The ﬁrst quarter was Grinnell's
oig quarter. After a fumble by life-
Lain, Davis blocked a punt, recovered
and wrledrlt 'to the 12 yard line
where he was downed by Quire, From
this position Stotts scored on a play
through center. Penn kicked off to
Grinnoll again and after a straight
march down the field, Slotts scored
the second touchdown through the
center. As the quarter ended, McClain
Stotts and Meetcr were making sub-
staniial gains through Penn's line and
around the ends. Early in the second
quarter sums returned a punt for the
third touchdown which ended the
scoring for the day. Grlnnell suffered
several penalties which forced them
to kick The quarter ended with the
ball on the 50 yard line, Grinnell’s
ball. first and too.

Many Subs.

Substitutions were made freely at
the beginning of the second half. Play
was ragged in the third quarter with
Penn having a slight advantage. At
times Penn made substantial gains
Lhmugh the line and by the aerial
route, and again their backs were
stopped hefore'reoching the line of
scrimmage. Penn threatened to score
for the first time and once, due to
a blocked punt, the half was on Grin-
Dell‘s 1 yard line in Grrnnell's p05»
session By a punt and a penalty it
was taken to the center of the field
and Penn never threatened again, At
the beginning of the fourth quarter
the line-up that started the game was
used and with Grinncll playing o safe,
defensive game practically all the
time, the game ended as Niblo re-
ceived Stotts' 20 yard pass on the
Penn if yard line.

The University of California boosts

press box. Two modernly equipped
press boxes, one on the edge of the

throughout the your, Tire recitals
will be given by Dr. Knight, Mr. Mab

Smith, and others of the advanced
pupils.

It. is intcnded that this year each
program will consist of three items,
two of which shall have definite
academic values: the third to be c
piece of thc.audience‘s own selection.
Anyone wishing to have a certain
piece played may communicate his
request to Dr. Knight. The only
provise is that jazz will not and can-
not be played at any time, land such
popular overtures as "Poet and PeaSr
tint" and "William Tell" will not be
included because they arc already
well known to the public. One of the
aims in giving these recitals is to get
the student acquainted with the lesser
known compositions.

The practice of giving these recitals
was inaugurated last year when thev
were played every Wednesday after
noon from 1-3 o'clock. The interest
shown by the students at that time
has adequately war-ranted their cons
