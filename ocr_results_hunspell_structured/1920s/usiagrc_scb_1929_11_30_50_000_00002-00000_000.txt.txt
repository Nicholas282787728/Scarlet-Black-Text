MIXED DINING.

When the inquiring reporter recently asked various
members of tho‘ Grinnell student body their opinion of
9 system of mixed dining in th! dormitory and quad-
rangle dining rooms, he not only found a surprising un-
animity of opinion on the subject, but received several
reasons which seem to indicate the possible advantages
of such a system, Their! composite opinions are print:
ed in today’s Campus Opinion.

First, While Grinnell men have this year discard-
ed many of their primitive actions of former years, at
the table there is still much to be desired if they are
to leave Grinnell with ﬁne social bearing. Cultured

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

table behavior is certainly valuableiin the business
world rumor has it that the big business executive em»
ploys cultured ways even when, in solitude, he sips his
bowlful of soup, and often after graduation one attends
mixed social affairs requiring polished manners. No»
thing should aid more in developing such good manners
hmong‘ Grinnell men than the presence once a week of
a group from the the quadrangle at the dinner table.
and of a hegira on the part of the men to the women's
dining hall.

Then. too. n sytem of mixed dining would enable
the students to become really bot-tar acquainted, for
where can one get better acquainted with a girl than
when passing her a bowl of gravy before helping him—
self? The sense of unily and the spirit of democracy
would certainly be enhanced by such a system.

While the details of such a plan would have to be
worked out, one way might be for two cottages to eat
at the dormitories one evening in the week; on the
same evening, three dormitories would eat at the quad-
rangle. That a Quaker meeting might be avoided, the
proportion of men to women at each table might be
half and half. Lantern is at presenL considering such
a plan, and the organization is urged to continue its
efforts to introduce such a. system, it would be a real
addition to Grinnell's social life.

AN A. R. It TELEPHONE.

We are Sure that anyone who has had that isolat—
ed feeling of being in A. R. H. late some afternoon
Without being able to communicate with the outside
World by any other means than venturing out into the
cold November atmosphere will sympathize with a
movement to install a public telephone in A. R. H. or
else reserve one of the offices for the use of the stun
dents. ‘

At present the only telephones in the recitation
hell are situated in private offices which are locked up
when unoccupied, When students wish to use a phone
therefore they must either break in on s Conference
being held in one of the offices that are occupied or
else use the library phone, In either case they are
interfering with the people for whose use the particu-
lar phone in question was put in.

since there is already a telephone system in A. R.
H. it should not be very difficult to tap the present
lines and make two extensions running to phones
placed in strategic positions in Lhe recitation hall, The
men's and Women's locker rooms on the ﬁrst ﬂoor might.
be as convenient a place as any for these public phones.

Or if the cbllege preferred rim. to make any addi-
tianhl extensions to the prcsent A. R. H. telephone sy5r
Lem one of [he offices which are not in frequent use
could be kept open as a public phone booth.

The installation of Lwo phones or the setting aside
of one of the offices as E public booth should not be a
very difficult matter, and the advantages resulting
from such an improvement would easily compensate for

any trouble involved.
