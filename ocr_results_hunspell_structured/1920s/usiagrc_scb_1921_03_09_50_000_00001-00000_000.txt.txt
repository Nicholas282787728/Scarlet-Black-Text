ies of the court in spots, At the
ends, under thc baskets, fans stood in

Smirl: With Rush

The Pioneers got away with a rush,
completely sweeping the Bulldog five
off its feet. Fearing scored first, the
Pioneer center dropping a clean mark-
er in the first two minutes of play.
Wassenaar and Payseur each tossed
a. foul. Then Captain Evans, playing
strongly and following in well, caged
three successive baskets from the
floor and brought the total up to 9—1.
Benz blocked an opponent's shot,
siezed the sphere, and dribbled the
length of the floor for a short basket,
making it 11 to 1. Payseur shot a
long basket and a foul, and then
, counted another ringer on a pretty
tip-up after following in. Evans
scored another snort basket and Pay»
seur, not to be outdone, counted his
third field counter and helped out
with another foul.

Lead at 1'!de
The half ended with the count 14 to
9 in Gl'inllell’s favor. The Pioneers
had outplayed the Bulldogs clearly
and consistently. Evans with a' total
of four field counters, was the scar—
