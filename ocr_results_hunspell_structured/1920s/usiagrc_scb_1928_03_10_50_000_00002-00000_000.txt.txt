Gll'l‘l HY TOXGlli THOUGHTS.

students who iilli appreciate the value oi speech
training, and who realize the limited opportunity for-
obtaining it at Grinnell, will grant us a deeper motive
in writing this article tllail merely trying to make
one editorial bloom where none hiooiued before. At
the present time a speech department with a personnel
of two instructors is t lg to handle the biirdeil of
seeing that some $00 Grinncliiaiis learn what to do with
ibemseh‘es it ever they should be caught upon a public
platform with the stage door locked and n cold-eyed
audience iii front. Undoubtedly the students themselves
are at fault because they have riot demanded more
speech courses. and the trustees are at iaiilt because
they have not emphasized the value of speech training in
outlining-the curriculum, i

It should be unnecessary to go over the countless
reasons why speech training is important, One could
repeat again and again that “spe- ing is one or tile most
important functions in our daily life," and insist after
the manner of the ancient patriarehs, that“eronaditch-

digger should learn to speak. because some day he might
be called upon at a ditch-diggers convention, People
or college training are expected to be leader in the cdiir
cational liic ot the communities where tho‘ so to live,
and should leave college equipped to ca the message
or Griiirlell adequately,

Personally. we would like to sec a situation in urine
nail where at least one year of speech training , tirade
compulsory Just as tr simian Eugli i is, l{rloulcdge oi
sentence structure and the proper us of periods and
comma is absolutely essential, hilt adequate
quaint. ice with ORAL periods and column, s just a
heel; nry to a well balanced personality. |

1 other. the only place to aeoii e, tr 'ning iil specch
, in the clas rooni, \\ hove the student ii an audience
provided for him every day. The practical value ot spccch
training has born no more clc > - clllDllASimd than
in the recent ma >mdclil.s conccr g mcil' goi'cl'nr
'mtuit. A great man men “spoke." but how leiv or them
really said anything:l As he rccall the meetings now
about the oiii‘ speech that stands out distinctly was
one made, by a sttldttnt who has had great deal
or speech training in Ci'iiincll. and the spontaneous
applause that gi'ecictl his irort tall: slurp ed that the rucii
could appreciate thc driicrencc betuccn a good speech
and a lot of sound arid lui

We s "gait ti -t that students uho can possibly do
so take speech tr Hing bclore they leave G hired. and
second. that the trustees liiul a way of increas in; the
personnel at the department so it will no longer lrcl
necessary to turn away students as was done the ﬁrst
of the year.

It has been said that it each ind idiial irall is ruade a
unit of government, it will be very hard to not men to‘
discipline a members or their own building, However, the
increased responsibility and the natural rivalry among
the halls could be used to good cllcct in eniorcing the
new government. We are not suggesting that additionar
intramural points be given a building for each member

The chicl merit of the plan is that it will cm-

YOU can prove it. Prince Albert is the Nation’s
largest~selling brand of pipe-tobacco. It brings
joy to more smokers than any other brand.
Q. E. D.! Your ﬁrst fragrant whiff will set your
mouth a-watering.

And your ﬁrst taste of good old P. A. in a
pipe will satisfy your pipe-hunger as nothing
else ever has. Cool as the ﬁrst period. Welcome
as the last. Mellow and mild and long-burning,
right to the bottom of the bowl. Try P. A.,
