SWIDDIING MEET 1’0 'l‘l’OhlilL

The swimming meet scheduled to he
held with times here on Saturday ere
euing has been postponed by the our
letic authorites of the two schools un-

til Monday evening at 8:15. The meet -
will be staged in the G nnell tank:

and from all indications will be an
interesting spectacle. ‘

AS the first meet to be held in the
local pool. the dual should attract
more than passing interest. The lim7
ited seating capacity of the pool room
will make it necessary that those who
wish to see the contest get to the
building early.

An intelligent obs river has long
suspected that H. L Mencken's “low-a

states besides that in which the tall
corn grows. "Potosi Hills.” a series

prising the leading article or the
the March Tanager, reinforces [Vli'sl
feeling that the Mencken publicity for
Iowa may have been relatively underv

The author has a pleasing aflnity for
gathering sketches of peculiar person-
ages such as Peter nentz, iecblc wittcd

Rutherford Contributes

That the way to a man’s heart is

mon knowledge of women since the
days of Cleopatra. but it remained for
Geddes w. Rutherford, former profe57
sor of government at Grinnell, to point
out the importance of the ”mobiliza-
-tion of Europe's finest l'innds” in the
solving of delicate problems of diplome
ucy. in his article, "European Dine
lomats at \Vork,"," Mr, Rutherford has
other contributions; he tells or the
passing of the “more occult arts of
inrigne and deception" and the growth
of a ”quiet spirit of hopetulness" at
Geneva.

The stimulation of foreign travel
and residence is responsible for a sec-
ond contribution. “Kitsune Sama," by

a story of the egoistrdancer who this

rosaku San inadvertently throws

Boyd’s story ”Kitsune Selma," has been
unjustly criticized for lack of’ local
'color, and will meet with the approval
of readers, I believe.
