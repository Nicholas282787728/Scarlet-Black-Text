Music!

good time.

One of the ailment fallacies in Grinnell—
and a. few other places~is that you have to
learn music a good deal as you would learn
Greek; and unless ou undergo a long and pain-
ful course of learning, music is 311 Greek town.

with radius broadcasting symphony orchestras,
and talking-machines singing airs from operas
A goodly proportion of our citizenry can now
look a. bassoon in the face without the slightest
perturbation. and can walk right up to the last
movement of a symphony without quivering on

There are a few

few Most of us will not. be harmed by occu-

sional indulgence. The

few who will become

so intoxicated by music as never to be able to
leave it alone need no symphony. for they have
discovered a new world.
