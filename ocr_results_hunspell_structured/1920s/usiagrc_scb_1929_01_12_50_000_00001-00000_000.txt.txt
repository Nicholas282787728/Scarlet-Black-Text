The Swiss musician exhibited “its
usual power and tone in his playing
of the Fantasy iii F minor by (‘llﬂllln
and the difficult Sonata, op. 57 (Apr
passiondta) by Beethoven, although
the program was consistently brllr
liaiit. .

The Fantasy in F minor introduced
a group or four Chopin pieces, of
which the second was Nocturne in
F major. producing a quiet contrast
to the preceding number. The Scher-
20 in B flat minor made a spirited
ending to the group. As an encore
ltlr. Gaiiz played a Nocturne by Chu-
pin.

Fantasies by Bach and Haydn, Roe
nianza in A flat by Mozart, improm-
ptii in A flat by Schubert, and the
Beethoven Sonata Apoassionata com-
posed the second group. The music—

The composition of original dances
is an interesting innovation recently
introduced by Miss (‘ltil'zi J. Andersen,
director or physical education for
women, in her advanced class in not
llral and character dancing. The
work during the early part of the
semester emphasized technique larger
ly, but because of the talent display—
ed composition has now been under--
takcn more extensively than cvcr hell
fore in previmls years.

The class of forty members. many
of whom had not studied dancing pre-
vious to their enrollment in the class
last September, have accomplished
excellent original work in the com-
position of group dances, couple
dances and character dances. Com-
po. tion includes the selection of
music, and most embody balance,
proper rhythm, and perfection of
technique Several dances have new
composed during the class hour.
while those composed by individuals
and groups outside of the class per-
iod are presented to the class for
criticism, Many of those will subser
nucntly be used for class work.

Dr. Skinner, working with Professor,

isolated a compound from camphor,
which was thought to have one of,

were not to be denied.

Time after time the Bulldogs work
on the ball close in to the Grinnell
goal during the first pciiod, only to
miss shot after shot, Even with their
iiequent misses the enemy were able
to count from the floor often enough
to lead the Pioneers at intermission.
Rlll‘l‘ started the scoring with a pret-

short shot for a goal in the first
minute or play, but was iollowing by
a duplicate by King, Drake forward.
A tool goal apiece left the score at
tin-cc-all. and the score knot'ted
at s ill a fcw minutes later From
this point the Bulldogs forged to the
front, and remained so to the end,
incre lg the moygiu grcatly during
the first ten minutes of the second
half.

The stiffness of the Bulldog dee

ever he considered. is illustrated by
the fact that the Grinncll quint were
able to score but one point during
the first fifteen minutes of the sec-
ond period. Humphrey crashed
through with a free throw and a short
basket in the closing minutes of play.
Throughout the game the Grilinell
squad were able to garner but three
goals from the field, Coggeshall, Buff
and Humphrey being responsible for
one each.

of the Pioneers the best exhibitions
were presented by Humphrey, husky
center, and Macy, guard, Although
the ciitire squad seemed far below-
