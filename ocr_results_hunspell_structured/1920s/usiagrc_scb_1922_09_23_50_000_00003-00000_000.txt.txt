September so'at the Coloniallcoines
"Irene" the dainty musical comedy
which so delighted millions of
theatl'egoel‘s lust year. This time
it will be given by the Number
One New York Company, the
Due in fact which appeared in it
at the Vanderbilt Theatre, New York,
for so long a time.
it is distinctly a hh‘the sort or
evening's entertainment, having a
double guarantee in that the book
was written by James Montgomery
and the music by Harry Tierney.

'Joseph McCarthy composed the lyrics.

ilr. Montgomery has given the play
a more than ordinary amount 01' ston’
which, howeverV does not detract a. bit
from its spontanlty. The music is
unusually pleasing throughout: the
song “Alice Blue Gown" has proven
the biggest favorite. ”Castle of
Dreams" is a haunting air. "Sky
Rocket” is e spirited melody and
"We're Getting Away With It,” is

‘always put over with a large amount
01- upon"

" “AMILY NIGHT" ABLISIIED

Will Be Held Each "llursﬂay Night at
Strum! Theater.

"Family Night" has been established
at the Strand and last night which
was the opening night many families
took advantage of the special prices
‘for the working man who feels that
he is unable to afford the regular
price. “Family Nights” will extend
throughout the winter and will
he held each'rhursday night.
J, N. Jaccnsen is the originator of
,thc plan and ,._ \V. lilart and Son have
'uureed to ll)’ out the plan to see
whether the innovation can ‘le mode
a permanent thing. Many people. it
is thought. do not attend tooling pic-
ture shows, the cheapest torm oi en—
tertainment, hecause they cannot al-
lurd to pay the usal fee. By reducing
the price tor “Family Night" to 15
cents for adults and 10 cents (or chil—
dren it is hoped that many who cannot
go otherwise will take advantage or
the rates.
