Editor Scarlet and Black:

According to a recent announcement
from the college ottice there is to be
no college di ectory published this
year. It seem. to us that there is
some point where retrenchment should
cease, but, of course, it is not for us
to say where. We thought the limit
had Just about been treached when we
found that about half the courses we
wanted were not being ottersd be-
cause the instructors were not present
to give them. But evidently the end
is not yet, for in every class which
we do attend we are assessed tor the
purpose of buying books to be used
in the library. Has the library mud
also been pumped dry’.’ it seems to us
that in this year when many students
are tor-cod to borrow money on which
to attend college that a tew less fees
’instead or many more might go bet
ter.

It is not the fact, so much, that we
are not getting a college directory.
but the fact that we are paying conr
siderably more to attend Grinuell than
we would to attend any other college
in the state, and yet the advantages
which we are otfered in class room
work are not so far superior as they

‘ Kansas Frosh Revolt

Brings Just Deserts

Lawrence, Kane, Sept. 28,—This
morning, early visitors to the Hill
were attracted to a glaring sign in
red paint, on the side walk directly in
trout oi the law school. It was the
h'eshmen’s annual cry or deﬁance, in
protest to the tyrannical reign of the
upper classmen, seeming to he dii'eel~
ed especially to the Laws, judging
from the location at this work of art
which reads, “DOWN WITH THESE
PlGrHEADED CHEAFSCREW UP-
PER CLASSMEN. WE no OUR OWN
SIGN PAINTING." Evidently this
little greeting lelt A bad taste in the
months at the Laws, as the paddle
was wielded more or less vigorously
on several of the "Fresh" who were
unfortunate enough to have on 8:30
class, and who happened to pass
Green Hall.

University of Kansas.~Paddlers to
about the number or one hundred who
were out paying after-dinner calls to
the elusive h-osh Thursday night,
tound one chap who evidently didn’t
know the war was over.

As the hrethern approached the
house wherein lived a‘freshman from
Kansas City, they discovered the said
ireshman was locking the windows or
his room, also the door; and, on com-
pletion of this, was detying any and
all to come and get him. One of the
holder spirits of the paddlers‘ crowd
took the lead and stepped up to the
front window and demanded admit-
tance. Refused this, he jimmed the
window with a knife, stepped over
the silt, and looked down into the
mouth or one of those large baritone
instruments known so a revolver.

This lender or the “bighmekers”
said to the hardboiled fresh, "You
haven't the nerve to shoot."

Evidently, though, the [rash was
not afraid to shoot, for he ﬁred one
shot at the leader of the gang, miss-
ing him about two teet;.and the bul-
let pused through the upper win.
dowpane breaking the glass.

Apparently this angered the pad-
dlers somewhat, tor they grabbed
iriend ireshie, conveyed him to the
street, and administered unto him the
kind of caresses that: father used to
give him out in the wood-shed.
