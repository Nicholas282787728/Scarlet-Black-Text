Grinnell and Drake will clash {or
the ﬁrst time in Drake's new ﬁeld
house this evening, the battle also
marking the ﬁnal appearance of Chuck
Everett, perhaps the greatest all-
around athlete who ever wore Bulldog
colors. The game promises to be re
pletc with the same thrills that have
always presented themselves in Grin
nell~Drztlie inclces, but to a greater eh
tent than heretofore, because of the
unexpected rise and fall of the two
teams.

Drillie Shows Strength

Drake has .sbnwn remarkable power
in her last two games, with victories
over Nebraska, by one point. and
Alnes by a heavy margin. The Bull-
dogs, coached by Bill Boelter, former
Drake ace, have developed a fast.
clever team, built mainly around Cap-
tain Everett. Barney Meyers, a jun-
ior member of the outﬁt, has been
leading the Bulldogs in scoring, and
from all reports is hitting the hoop
with .uncanny frequency.

hociter will probably start Captain
Everett and Meyers at the forward
berths. Simpson at center, with former
captain Art Ashby, and Pike Lawless
at the guard posts.

Coach Hayes has been working his
Pioneer hoopsters overtime this week
in preparation for making a determ-
ined stand in the Valley race. With
two bad defeats at Hm hands 057M
souri and Washington last week endl
the Pioneer team can be counted upon
to play the game of its life.

Dinis Winches Everett

Coggeshali has been stepping in his
former stride during the past week,‘
and will probably he paired with Chase
at one of the forwards. Chase has
almost entirely recovered from the ef-
fects of a leg injury, and has been
shaving the ball through the net in
nice style lately Davis may be seen
at either center or forward, but either
way the main task that the curly
haired planer will lace, will be tho. he
doing of Everett; this task bav as
been assigned to the grid captain dur.
in; practice sessions.

Niblo will play at center if not at
guard, and Fall will no doubt occupy
the back guard position Fail slump-
ed considerably in his playing during
the southern trip, but has picked up
a great deal during the past week.

The return game against Ames, at

Every Concert Is All

By Margaret. Smith.

"Every concert is to me an adven-
ture and a distinct experience,” said
Mr. Joseph szigetl, after his violin
recital here last Friday night. This
attitude partly explains his complete
individuality. When an crust can
give four recitals every Week for more
than a decade and still insist that
every program becomes a positive
and responses, to such an extent that
every program becomes a positive adv
venture, he is certainly equipped all»
mirably for his chosen profession.

TFsiigcu found his Grinnell andie
ence “refreshing" and a mental relief
from both the ”highrlow—brows" and a.
group of exacting critics. As for the
Chapel itself, he said, "If there is any
fault to ﬁnd with it, it is that the
lids nappy Home Lilo

acoustics are a bit too brilliant."

It is interesting to know that, by act-
ual demonstration, Mr. Szigeu' is con-
vinced that a professional artist can
have a Successful career and at the
same time a. more than satisfactory
home lite. Bis home is in Paris, and
since we are able to swear to the ex-
istence of his successfu career, most of
us will be perfectly willing to trike his
word for the more than satisfactory
home life.

‘There is a. possibility that Art for
itself alone may become commercial-
lzed, both in this country and in Elk
rope," he said. “Music, as an art,
has no limitations, but is a progres—
sion and a development not only of

Joseph Szigeti, Famous Violinist

Adventure

itself, but the perfecting of the areal.~
lll'e whose progress it manifests in its
him." To those artists to Whom their
ztrt is it religion must go the responsi—
bi ty of eliminating the commercializ-
ing elements.

Dcwtcd to Music

Mr. Szigeti is very hospitable to
modern music, but he is no fadrlist. He
believes that the great works of the
older masters must be the founda~
tion of a musician’s equipment, He
has done some composing, but _“only
for myself, nothing for the public."

Mr. Szigeti’s ﬁrst conscious thought
was not that he was a great genius,
From 2, very small child, however,
when most youngsters have consecrat-
‘ed their lives t0 the army or the navy
or a policemau‘s beat, Joseph Szigcti
knew that he could never be anything
but a musician. The volcano in him-
self gradually made itself felt, until
lardstic perfection became El powerful
and irresistible urge. The place he
has won in the hearts of his fellow mu-
sicians and his listeners is the reward
or his devotion to his gods. He long
lago realized that form proclaims itself
in vain, and is nothing unless the soul
speaks. He has be'en always unwilling
to make concessions for the sake of
superficial effect. His determination
to possess a consummate mastery of
his instrument has been to provide the

means through which his individuality
of feeling and spirit might be mani-
tested,

EXHIBITS SHEER. HONESTY

Convincing Ililerju'etuli 0 Power Gives
SL'ilitlurilized Cl ics New
rillpelll to Healer.

By G. licrbcit Knight.

Joseph Szigeti, playing on Friday
evening, January 21, for the first time
in Grinnell was greeted by a large
audience cxpecting much—very much
for him, and it is with satisfaction
that this revrewer can record the fact
that the great artists playing and
musicianship not only sustained the
reputation he enjoys, but even
hanccd it.

The unusual qualities of Mr.
Szigeti’s musicianship can scarcely be
overremphasized. He may not he the
only artist showing brillianey and
wizardry, and he may not be the only
virtuoso capable of holding an audi-
ence enthralled throughout a lengthy
and somewhat austere program, but it
must be freely admitted that few of
his contemporaries exhibit the sheer
honesty of purpose and the wide
knowledge of a complex art that Mr.
szigeti evidences.

s patiiclic Understanding

Honesty of purpose is reflected not
only in Mr. Szigeti’s playing, but in
the choice of music to be played. His
Grinnell program included two ex-
tended classics, a Each sonata - for
violin alone and a Schubert Sonatina,
together with a Corelli suite and a
Slow Movement of Brahms, and his
choice 01' these items certified Mr.
Szlgeti’s integrity. But it was left to
Mr. Szigcti himself to reveal some-
thing more precious still—a. sympa—
thetic understanding of each of the
classics, semlrclassics and “pastels"
he played. .

Mr. S getl’s playing had in it, too.
something more than understanding
and sincerity of purpose. It carried
with it a curlosiy convincing inter»
pretative power that gave the stand
°drdized classics a new appeal. For
this reason his program—which in
the hands of a lesser artist would
have seemed “top»heavy” with the
classics~never failed to grip an aud—
ience that appeared to be visibly mov~
,ed and swayed by the power of the
music itself.

Ni) Tati'lh-lness

Even the third part of Mr. Sziget s
program, a group of pieces of lighter-
and siighter texture, carried but the
faintest trace of tnwdriness or triv-
iality. Herc, everything Mr. szigeti
played was transformed, and to the
artist himself must be given much
croditiror the peculiar effectiveness of
Milliiiud's "Brazilian Dance" and Hu-
bay’s "Zephyr.” A false emphasis of
the pungent Millialldizui idom would
haven given the “Brazilian Dance"
more than a suggestion of crude gro—
tesqucrie and futility. but Mr. Szigeti’s
treatment of it and Huhay's “Zephyr"
save these pidunnt confections an ap-
peal which the audience found irrc-
sistible. .

Mr. Kurt Ruhrseitz, at the piano,
proved himself to be an exemplary co-
artist. His musi anship, notable and
satisfying, aided greatly in making the
concert an event quite memorable,
perhaps even unforgettable,
