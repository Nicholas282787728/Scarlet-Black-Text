Atwood Brock. Gr nell high school
star, has been as ’gned the piiiot_pos—

boy has heon very instrumental in the
success of the freshmen. Brock is
left handed. and used this iact to
great advantage. He shows promise
of heco’niing one o! the host cages
men on the squad.

Thomis occupies one, guard post
while the other is held by the can-
tain oi the yearling crew, Dwight Mes
Creai-y. This husky lad. fresh from
Omaha. plays a heady game. and is a
line passer. Although not tall. he is
eapahle at retrieving the hall from

Washington university continued
her inconsistent policy of \\'inrgzimer
losera game, by allowing the Kansas
Ags to top them by one point in a
31—30 contest in st. Louis the other
evening. The Bears were given the
edge in the dope hut the Kaggic
sharpshooters overcame this adconir
age. if so it can he called. to nose out
the Washington team in a last mine
iite rail. What we would like to
know is how St. Louis university can
trounce the Aggies . ‘22, the night
beiore. and have the Bears snhmit to
a defeat on their own ﬂour hr the
same team. Can Ames heat the Bears?

Griluieli teams are not often held
to three haskets as they were last
night. but perhaps the less we speak
of that the hotter. Gi-iiineli fans who
witnessed the game were under the
conviction that the Grinneii basket in
the second half was covered with a
hoard. Free throws seemed to bounce
oft the bottom of the net.

Gr' neii fans will rememher
Kansas Jayhawks as a group of husk-
ies. ranging into upper altitudes. but
when the Kansans met the California
Bears in their series in Berkeley.lhe
Joyhnwkers were unable to cope with
the height or the Bear players. In
every game the Californians used this
fact to great advantage. winning the
lirst two games at the series handiv
ly. and dropping only the last hy a
one-point margin.

/ “Kilic” Wilhelm was~heard to mute
ter to himself in the hits returiiingi
from the Drake game last night.
