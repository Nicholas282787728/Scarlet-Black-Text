Chance of Victory
Over Penn.

Criniiell's chances of defeating Penn
college of Oskaloosa here in the ﬁrst
basketball tilt of the 1920 season Tues-
day night were dimmcfl yéstcrday aﬂ-
ernoon when Dav d Evans, a forward
on last year's var ‘ty, tore a cartilage
in his left knee du ing practice. He
will be out or the lineup several
weeks, and may turn in his basketball
suit in order to have his knee in the
best of condition tor track work' later
in the year.

Practically a new team will face
Penn in the initial battle of the year.
Captain winter and Wessenar are the
only men with past varsity experience.
Varsity substitutes of last year may
not gain a berth on the sound as they
are being given keen competition by
the new men. Twentyﬁve players,
among whom are many high school
stars of past years, are candidates for;
varsity positions. The quintet Conch
Cftl'l Compton picks to face the Penn
ﬁvc in the Men’s gymnasium will make
up in aggro. sivencss what they lack in
experience. ,

Penn rive strong.

The strength of the Penn arc is on
known in local circles The squad
has been practicing win the 051m—
loosa Y. M C. A. quintet. Coal short—
age and famine of a month ago did
not interfere greatly with their prace
ticc. .The Penn team is considered a
strong aggregation.

Although several varsity candidates
came back lrom their Ch stmas va—
clitinll scveral days early, ieul varsity
work did not begin until Monday. Ath.
letic Director H. J. Huff noted as coach
several days this week because of do-
ties calling Coacli Compton to Des
luoines.

After ﬁve days' practice, the men
are beginning to get into their stride.
of various combinations
being tried by Coach Compton is fairly
good. None of the men are shooting
baskets as well as they might, but
with today’s and Monday's practices,

ltheir "basket" eyes will bc in good

trim. Yesterday was the first time
that Wassouar was
out, he being delayed several days in
Ietllrning to Gr.inncll l-le was mac»
ticing several weeks before the holi-
days, and with another days practic,
should be back nearer his old time
stride. 4
Competition is especially keen
among candidates trying for the guard
positions. ﬁve men being out lor this
berth. Four men are. striving to land
forward jobs, while the center position
is attracting three possibilitir .
Captain winter, or last reap team,

Lakes quintet when it touroil tli
country last season, lici-bi-echtsmcyei,

numbered among those who are
