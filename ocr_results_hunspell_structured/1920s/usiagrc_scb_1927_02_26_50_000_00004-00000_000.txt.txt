The task of picking a fair intramural
teiiro is alu'zt" one that druws forth
5. considerable amount of observation,
comparison, and‘ prejudichthe latter
to be discounted as much as possible.
The selections this year are made
doubly hard because of the presence
of is. good deal more real basket ball
talent than has been present in the
cage series of bygone years. Almost
Without exceptions the teams lined up
by each building were far better than
those which played lest year—compar-
iug building by building.

The custom heretofore has been to
select one team that would include
members of both ”A" and ”B" teams,
that is, a iirst and second team, This
year it was deemed advisable to change
this practice, and to pick a team for
each of the sections The extra man
picked do away with the necessity of
having a second team in each insmuce.
The reason for this system of having
two teams is justiﬁed by the fact that
the two sections do not compete against
each other, and consequently the men
of these two divisions cannot be com-
pared fairly.

: Dibble l’liicos rive

Dibble hall, the championship house,
had an army of cage talent in their
two squads that could easily have
been the enVy of any building captain.
Being the largest of the halls, Dibble
was fortunate enough to be able to se-

lect from a much larger llllmher of can-
didates than were the other buildings.
In awarding the positions on the hour
oral‘l tennis careful consideration was
taken oi the amount of time played by
each individual, its well as his scoring
or defensive record. The placing of
ﬁve men Iroln the Court House on the
mythical teams is fair enough because
of the record nlatle by the northend
boys, several of their games being won
ll)’ uide margins.

Ulitl-l: lllilll, the runiieI-seup for the
l-hiullpionsllil). place three roan on the
two teams ,aIlLl had several other men
who missed making: the teams by the
narrowest of margins. lilartin, Clark
captain. played one of the best games
of all the competitors this season. his
last. Smith hall lllueed two men, Lan<
gun, two, Building Three, two, and
Building Four one,

The selection of the “A" team re—
vealed the fact that in this division
there was a stronger array of cage
material than in the "B’ 'lectgue, with
but fell exceptions. One of the for-
ward berths is held down by Gray, cap-
tam of the championship crew, and
one of the cleverest players in the ser-
ies. Gray also contributed a consider-
zbhle total to his team's scoring, landc
ing in fourth place after only compet-
ing in four games. Gray is also named
leader of the team.

Sir-ublo and Clifford sun-roll

Struhle, Lungun, and Clifford of the
stable team, hold down the other two
Positions that are nominated. Struble
was really the main cog in the Langan
attack and contributed a. fair total of
lpoints Clifford, playing on a com-
‘lliarzttively weal: teaml scored consist-
ently throughout the series, and
showed a ﬁne ability for breaking up
opposing attacks.

Smiley, Dibble, third in“ the scoring
for the series, and Bradstreet, Smith,
are named as centers on the team.
. Both men have the height ncessal'y to
| the position, and used it to good advan-
tag throughout the games, each scoring
high in all the contests.

Lovejoy reigns king of the guarding
group, Although playing in a back-
court position, the Smith hall leader
stood second in scoring, closely press-
ing Dulie for the honor. Lovejoy
played ﬁne hall throughout the series.

of the Forensic club at the torwards. .
These three men in any combination. I

would iurhish plenty of worry for any
guards. Each is a good dribbler, and
ihel' have uncanny basket orbs. Duke
is (he most oulstnnding, and demon-
strated that he capable of playing

rclton, Dibble, and Schroer, Kelly
SLiilile, are at the center positions.
Fellow and Schroer each stood high in
the scoring column, and played fine
ball In practically all their games.
Feltoll suffered a letsdoun in the
Clark Hull game that perhaps cast his
team the battle. Schroer, though only
in school the ﬁrst semester, played re
workable basketball in all his starts,
and deserves the position without dues-
tlon.

Bradley, Clerk, Martens, Langan, and
Culver, Three, have been voted the
most capable guards of the “B" divis-
ion, although Car-hart, Dibble, also
played ilne basket ball in all of his
gamCs. Culver has been chosen to
lead this honorary selection as cap-
tain, and could no doubt direct the
team in an efficient manner. l
