(v‘ct College Spirit

Kenneth vinscl, . gave the first
studcnt speech, as representative of
the senior class. His speech was one
of the most impres ire of the evening,
and urged the tire hnten to get into
the spirit of the college as soon as
possrblc, saying that the sooner they
became affiliated with the real influ-
ences of the college life, the sooner
they would feel themselves one of the
Pioneer tribe. ,

Ellen Taylor, '24, was the freshman
‘spcalier. Her speech was in strong
support of the student movement, out—
lining the class quotas ,and giving the
amounts expected of each student,
and the amounts exbocted from the
college as a whole. She outlined
ways of carping the money, saying
that all pledges should be given from
the earnings of the individual sub-
scribcr, rather than from the pockets
of the parents.

Dean Cobb, chairman of the meet—
ing then ordered the committee to
pass out the pledges, and after a few
explanations the pledging began.
Pledging was done on the usual five
year basis. The pledges are in the
form of an agreement to give to the
college a certain amount, anyable in
five annual installments beginning
July 1st, 1921, with interest from date
of maturity at rate of 5%.
