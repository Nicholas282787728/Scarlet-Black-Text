it hits (or some time been one of
the hopes oi the scarlet and Black
that some day a system would he put
into eitect designed to regulate and
more wrdely distribute the number off'
orrtside activities in which students
may participate.

This is advocated both by those who'
do not get into things, and by Jihase
who do. The former believe that
class and college activrtres should ins
clude a greater portion or the student
body, so that the experience can he
gained by a larger number, so that
more talent can be uncovered, and
also in order that the activities or the
school cannnot be controlled by a tow.

Those who are most active think
that some limitingsystein should he
put into etioct because they realize
that not enough students pai-ucipare
in any important outside work that
brings them out of the academic air
mosphere and into contact with the
outside world. some say that they
wish the point system could he smrted
here so that they would not he called
upon to get, into too many of the so
called “thank-you" yobs on the cam-
pns. r

‘The‘mattei' of 'outslde activities is

, an all-important one in every college.
Some say that there are too many

things that take the minds of the stud—

ents from the real college

Others encoul‘age dramatics, athletics,

journalism, glee club won-k, and the

such, saying that it gives the stud-

em. the contact with the husiness and

practical world which he does not get

enough or in college halls. That many

go through college without 56",ng

any touch, o: the business world other

than paying their hoard hills and their

college fees, is claimed by 2. EI‘BEL

tivities, such as the business mana-
gershlps or the many plays that are
staged by student organizations, the
managers or publications, and the
like, all of whom must have gained
some knowledge or the business

world before they are through,

It is under-stood that the women or
the college already have some point5
system in use, which limits them to

' a certain numbergotz actiVitins.
ver-al colleges and universities
throughout the country are establlsbs
mg these systems to include the en-

Sev» .

tire list of university activities, n-om
athletic work to class ollices, and de—
bate, dramatic, and journalistic wor-
One of these is the University or Kur-
sas, which is now working out a sys-
tem which will limit the numher of
"jobs" held by any individual, and
will therefore result in distributing'
the positions among many more stud-
cnts.

The tendency is, when a person has
proved himsell capable in one posi.‘
tron, to shift all oil the work, honorary
and otherwise, onto him. This is boll}
a hardship on him, and is unjust to
those who should be getting the

college is a place for developing
raw material, and everyone should be

GOOD WORK FltLSlllIEi‘l

Special credit ztnd mention is due
the lreshriien class lor the way in
which they responded to the call iot-
lunds at their endowment drive din-
ner. Thc oi the appeal
irulong the freshmen was a mattcr oi
coujacture, due to their short resls
deuce iii Grinnell. it was thought by
some that perhaps they had not her
come enough a part of thc Grinnell
lite to appreciate the necessity of
raising money, and their

The next thing in line [or drive

workers is the final cleanup among

those who have not been seen. It Is
to be hoped that the people who have
nut pledgul, but intend to do so, Will
make is eitslcr for the drive workers
by sending in their pledges Withuut

ciullpus will be seen, according to [he
Plans of the committee.
THE CLASS ELECTIONS

As mentioned in a. late issue of the
Scarlet. and Black, she class diullcl's
which have been held by the {our
classes have done more than merely
help the'Grinnell Movement campaign
along. Perhaps of equal importance
is the class spirit than has invoked,
and the interest it has added to class
undertakings.

In spite of the {not that the hme
is over a. munch past [or the election
of second term ofﬁcers, we still think
Lhat there is some class spirit, al-
though rt may he“snrnerrhat drowsy.
These dinners have awakened the
campus to the possibilities of annual
or semiannual atlai'rs ot the same
type. it the meetings resulted in ac—
quaintaucesuips being formed in only
one 01‘ LWO cases, they were WDth
while.

In connection wiLh the election of

' class officers, the fact that tlre time is

how long past overdue goes to upnuld
the contention that class officers are
not Hf great enough importance. This
is partly because of the methods by
which they are elected, and partly be»
clause of the shortness of the term.

While we dislike to see anything
come into the school that Wuuld en-
courage ”dirty” politics, the Scarlet
and Black believes that if the elec-
tions :or all classes were put into the
hands of the student council, with
nominations hy petition or by class
selection, and a general election day
were held once a year, the interest in
politics on the campus would he once
moi-e aroused All elective oliicer—
ships oi the college could he put on
the ballot, and a general election.
much like municipal elections could
be held. This would also teach some
students the elements 0! modern poli-
ties. The details of this plan could
be worked out by the student council.
or by a. committee appmnted [or that
