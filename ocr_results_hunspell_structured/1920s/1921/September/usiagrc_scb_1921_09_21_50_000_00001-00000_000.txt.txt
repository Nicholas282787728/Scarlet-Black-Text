After spending a sleepless night in

to the city in the mouimg "ﬁghting
road," only to ﬁnd that the Sophs had
taken advantage or the rule pi-ohi

returned tor a good night’s sleep, Only
the hour prevented a pitched battle
and both sides went to the arena
which had been staked out between
the dorms and the stadium in an eta
iort to avoid as many puddles as pos-
sible, By six o'clock the ﬁeld was
lined with spectators, and the two
lines were drawn up ready tor the

exhibited the tact that they were free
and unsecured, awarding the scrap to
the class of 1924'.

Heavy Enrollment at
Wisconsin This Yeari

More than 7,000 students will gath-

assistants are now assembling to teach
the army of students that Wisconsin
sends to her state university,

Although no ottical estimates of the
probable enrollment have been an»
nounced the number or inquiries re»
carved by’ the registrar's and deaiis’
ottices during the sunriner indicate
that the total is likely to exceed the
7,004 students enrolled last Septem»
