DOPE POINTS T0 EVEN
GAME ON LOCAL FELD

After two weeks of hard grilling the ,
Pioneers aio fast rounding into shape‘:
for their game with Coe he1e next
Satur.day Coe has a strong team this
y~coi and the contest will be the big
gcst same 111 the state this week end.

The squad has been turning out
piacticc eailier than usual in ord
that special personal help cfm be giw
en each man. Every afternoon sees
three full teams in action and an
abundance of pep is eveiywhere in
evidence. Assistant Coach “Red" Egg
an in a statement to a staff reporter_
Said, “In all my years of activity in
Grinnell athletics I have never seen
such a wonderful spirit among, the
players as our men are showing now.”

study Fundamentals

During the past two’ weeks’ the
squad has been put through an exact-
ing review of the fuadamentals of the
game which will probably do much
to remedy the tendency for fumbling
which was in evidence at the ﬁrst of
the season.

On the whole, the team is in the best
'shape that it has been so far this
season Whitehlll being the only man
who is not on the active list and he
will probably he back in a few days.
Norelius is once again playing in
wonderful form. Playing against
“Polly" Wallace, alleAmerican center.
at Ames he looked to be fully as
strong as his much mired of oppcn~~
ent, two yards being the longest gain
that Ames could make through the
big Grilmell center. .

Players Going (loot!a

mtesman is also perfoiming in his
usual spectacular fashion, being eas-
ily the individual star of the Washing—
ton game. if these two men keep go—
ing at their present pace they should
prove strong contenders for honors
on the all-Valley eleven. Walters is
playing a clever game at half and
keeps looking better as the season
progresses. Subsantiall'gains can alr
ways be counted from Fearing and
Markley both of whom are players of
long experience.

At the guard position Schmidt has
been showing some real stuff both on
offensive and defensive work. Miller
and Janssen are both experienced tack
les but are being run a close race by
Schwyhart and Cushman. Rowlison,
harm and Eli-intuall are making a real
fight for the guardpositlon now held
by Schmidt and Nichols. 1n the back-
field Baker and Rafferty are doing
some unusually good work and have
good chances to land a berth on the
ﬁrst string.

Last Scrimmage Today
1 The/ last scrimmage before the

The last scvrimmage before the
game will be held this afte1nodn. The
remaining two days will be spent in
taperingl down for the game.

Coe has developed a team this year
which has been quite successful so
far, They were‘beaten by Ames by
one'incre touchdown than Crinncll.
thrashed Simpson, 70 to, 11 and
easily took Cornell into camp, Al-
though comparative scorcs cannot
be depended on as accurate dope.
these scores would seem to indicate
the Grinnell and Coe will go on the
ﬁeld Saturday with the odds fairly
even.

This game which is the second home
game of the season will probably at—
tract large attendance, Pep, which
has been rather under cover about the
the campus during the past few Weeks,
is springing to life and _by Saturday
it is expected that enthusiasm will be
running at its height in both the team
and the student body.

The cable read “Conditions are so
serious that help is imperative and es-

The course will be about three and

runners will make a' good showing.
The cross—country run will be held in
