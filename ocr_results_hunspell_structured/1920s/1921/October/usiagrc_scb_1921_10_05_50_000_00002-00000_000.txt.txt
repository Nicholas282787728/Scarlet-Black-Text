I CHAPEL

“Modern man IS on a bigger horse
than he can ride," said Prof. F. F,
Almy in Chapel Tllesllzty, "During the
last two years the mechanical forces
have gone far ahead of mental and
moral forces,” Quoting ironi Edward
E, Slosson in the independent, he said
“Horse power is greater per capita
in this nation than in any other." He
then stated the need of a greater incu-
tal education to balance the mechani-
cal forces, claiming that the only renu
cdy tor such a situation was "the
stimulating or the better elements in
the races of the world."

“You must have a definite purpose,
a goal to reach, and a force to get
there," declared Prof Ryan in a chapel
address Monday morning. "Your
work will not measure up to the high—
et standard in college unless it is
Systellizltizetl and unless you have use
cided upon the vocation you wish to
follow as a life work."

“Then altcr you have decided the
goal you want to reach, you will have
to ﬁnd that dynamic power to push
you onward to success—religion. And
In a college with the ideals of on s it
ought not to be difncult to ﬁnd relig-
nu, You need a definite goal and a
clear vision to reach that goal.”

“The Challenge of the Present Opr
[lol‘tunity to World Service" was the
subject chosen by Mr. E. S. Turner,
