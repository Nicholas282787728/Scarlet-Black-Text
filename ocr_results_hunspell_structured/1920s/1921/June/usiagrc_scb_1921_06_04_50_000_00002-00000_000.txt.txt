Moat oi the treshmen came
with high anticipatrons and with

them were disappointed. They found
that college life was not one ceaseless

were quite capable ot‘ governing the

such intent as does the professional

the fact still remains that the library

point fails to support the proposition.

The writer further stated that be-
cause of this lack of cooperation on
the part of the faculty that student
government would never be a success.
It is equally true that it will never
be a success until the students have
cooperated. in the meetings that
were held last week to nominate of-
ficers for the new council out of a
possible 550 that were eligible to at-
tend only 75 responded. This does
not point towards the best in coop-

In Serenade at
Dorms Thursday[

The Girls' Glee Club gave their an-
nual serenade at the Men's Dorms
Thursday night. The girls started
with Building Six and went down the
Line stopping at each building long
enough to sing two songs and to re—
ceive contributions from the large I.“-
dieuca of men that lined the windows
along the west side of the dormitories
Most of the buildings had got next to
the proposed serenade before it occur-—
red and had planned special numbers
for the event. Quantities ct candy,
together with varlaus miscellaneous
Idvica .were laid at the feet of the
ladies by frwhmen especially trained
for the occasion. Altogether it was a
moat cumin]: evening tor the men
and we hope that it was equally-so

least in a remunentive way.

Editor of the Scarlet and Black:
Dear Sir

There appeared under this head, in
the last issue of the Scarlet and
Black a communication which blamed
the tac'ulty for the seeming smte of
attairs in Grim-tell. Apparently this
communication laid the blame for ev»
erything at the feet of the faculty. The
only reason given was that the faculty
lacked openmindedness, that it they
would show themselves more willing
to cooperate with the students that
conditions would be improved a great
deal. To support his position the
author cited several c. amples. bet us
examine these and see if they are
valid. ,
The first illustration that was used
was the injustice on the part of the
library in searching the dormitories

 

problems of life. It is tor this rea-
son that every institution cf higher
education is judged by its graduates
and their achievements as citizens oi
the United states and of the world.
‘Thc many alumni of Grinnell have set
a high standard in this type of ser-
vice and to maintain the highest pro-
fessional standards and to better them
if possible is the paramount duty of
the graduating class. They must been
always before them the vision of "a
better and greater drinncll” and the
ideals attained here.
_G__
TO THE UNDERCLA Slum

As we near the end of the year,
there is always considerable discus-
sion among the underclassmen as to
whether or not they will return next
year, and as to the merits of spending
four years in college. The
answer may be extended to
ﬂuestionel‘s that is given to the sen-

some
these

iors, namely, “your College education
is what you make it, and on you de—
pends its success or failure,”

Many of these ulldel‘clussmen have

for. It is a well known tact in Grin-
ncli that a. book may not lawfully

student unless he has signed [or it.
There is nothing in this regulation
that is unreasonable, It would re-
quire Very little effort on the part of
the student to comply with this l'egua
lation. As we turn frnm the college
world to the world outside we find
that any rule which has been estab»
lishcd as a law was made to be
obeyed. Any time such a law is not
