ln hehalr oi- the student body oi
the college, The Scarlet and Black
wishes to extend otiieial welcome to
the visiting high school news men and
women or the state who are in Grin—
nell for the purpose or starting a per—
manent high school organization tol-
the exchange or ideas and high school
lirohleins.

Already the college press associa-
tion has had its good effect on the
college newspapers of the state, and
ii the public could have
eagerness shown by all of the‘dcle-
gates, to hear the problems of other

seen

schools presented and compared with
those in their own high schools, at
the session yesterday, it would be con—
vinced that nothing but good
come from the new organization.
Daily it becomes more evident that
to
alone, and run itsclt without regard

can

the institution that tries stand

to the experiences oi other similar
institutions, is backward, instead of
progressive in its management. it is
an~age of investigation, that we live
in, and nothing is attempted without
thorough investigation, in fact the
questionltire method and other meth-
ads of estimating the results of a
’ venture, based on the experience of
others lacing like problems,
been so reduced to a science that the

have

outcome of some new undertaking is
practically determined before it is
started.

Today and yesterday, high school
newspaper men and women traded
knowledge and experience in their
business, and each delegate should go
home with valuable new ideas,

The Scarlet and Black hopes that
the new organization will continue,
and uould be happy to see it return
to Grinnell each year for its meet-
ings. Grihnell's doors will constantly
be open, and Gl'innell's students at
the service of these visitors and their
successors. i

We wonder what has happened to
the old time class stunts that used to

Meet.

cars AND (limits

A great deal of criticism has been
heard on the campus concerning the
high charges made by the companies
from which the seniors obtain their
caps and gowns.

Although we have no deiinito in—
iorination as in how much it costs to
make a cup and gown, and how long
the ouiIits last, it certainly looks as
it an exorbitant charge were being
made tor their use.

Would it not be possible tor the
college, or for the student book store,
or some independent organization, to
purchase a number of cops and gowns
and rent them to the senior class an—
nually? n the book store took over
the enterprise, it is certain that the
senior apparel could he had tor
much lower rental, because the mail—
ing charges, impormnt
items could. be Eliminated. An enter-
prising student wiih some capital
could make this a part or his work,
and earn a small amount of proﬁt,
especially it he should get as much
for the service as some companies are

for handling student ploblems. We
do not know why the local student
council was not represented, but it
it had been it would have gained

the-

some valuable ideas,

According to reports of the conven-
tion, the best methods oi organizing
student activities, the use or the honor
system, the proctor system, and the
student union system were discussed.
One of the topics brought up was the
question of the duties of the student
'ccuncil if the honor system is elimi-
Hated.

One system that the conventinn
favored was what might be know-n as
the student union system. or student
association system, This system, as
used at the University of California,
is based on what is more known as
an ”assnciatcd students union," to
which every student belongs, and oi
which the student activities card, or
our semester fee, is the membership
card. The student council is the EX-
ecutivo hody ot the student union, and
handles the booking of dates ior cani-
pus activities, the iinances connected
with the semester fee (as we do here).
and a multitude of other details, he.

there.

The great difficulty which the new
local council may face is the question
of "whit to do." To be any active
