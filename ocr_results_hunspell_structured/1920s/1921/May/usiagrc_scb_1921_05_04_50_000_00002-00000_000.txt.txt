A NEW SPECIALTY

The past year has been one 111 gen-
eral development for the whole lire
oi the college, but no activity on the
local cnmpus has so come to the iore
with as much euthus1asm as has the
held or the dinnia and the local cam-
pus. what has
long been huoun to he a talented or-
ganization of high standards—the hl-a.

under the direction o[ Professors
Ryan and Bridges, and with the en—
thusiastlc help of the townspeople oi
Grlnllell the new interest in the drama
has'done much for the town and col~
lege. The 1o1n1a'tion or a drama cen
tel‘ of The Drama League of America
started the ball rolling toward better
plays, and has mil/la the Cheap swck
“company productiuu pass the lucal

Lheatres without a stay,

Not content with driving out the un-
desirable plays, the drama circles of
the college took steps to provide good
plays for the community, and the
classes in drama. production, which
includes training in directing, staging,
business managing, and acting in the?
atricals, proceeded to produce plays
to which the public were Invited, The
Monday “reading hours" are an es—
tablished thing, and always are Well
attended, not only by a large number
of students, but by many tow-11 peopie
who are interested in the drama.
“[101 a Varied program of reading,
production of playlets, and other pro-
grams, Monday night has come to be
set aside as the drama night.

The spreading oi the idea or com-
munity drama and line-act plays Ever
the country has been pushed here.
,New courses in the college have been
altered, and now there are courses in
play writing, staging, producing.
managing, and coaching, besides Lhe
general elementary courses. To the
members of the faculty who glv'e their
lull time to this work, goes the great-
est share oi the credit for giving
Grinnoll a fair claim to a position or
leadership in the realm o1 dramatic
study and production. The period
could weil he called, locally at least,
"the revival of the drama.”

Another event which is v1ewed with
much pleasure by a large number of
the members of the college community
and the tow-n community, is the evio
dent drawing together into closer rc-
lauonship and understanding, of the
townspeople and the college students
and isculty. The year has been fed-
tured by a number of large under-
takings the success oi: which has de~
pended upon the cooperation or the
two groups, and there is a more symo
pathetic feeling this year between the
two bodies than ever beiore.

Many things have, brought this
about, the most important or which
is the endowment campaign. The

pleled, and it is now being named 011
in the town. Both students and
townspeople are working Wth one
am] in view—to pl'esclve the college
and to help it grow. The community
dl'CU-“ZI. and community undertaking
movement has also helped to interest
townspeople iu ull‘cirs going on 1111
the campus, and has brought the two
into close contact.

Although the college is :1

claim that not enough oi such oppol-

college world has much to nilcr those
who do not go to college, and many
townspeople like to linow a number
of college students, and like to meet
the campus dwellers.
