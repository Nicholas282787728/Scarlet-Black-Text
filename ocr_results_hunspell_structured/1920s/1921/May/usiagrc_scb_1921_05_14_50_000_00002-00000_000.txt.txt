“Clarence" is a clever far-c comedyl
of young American life written by
Booth Ta mgton. The plot is ceiir
tcred around a young soldier just rcr
turned from France. Mr. Wheeler
hired Clarence to bc his secretary.
handy man around the house, and
also to perform the simple task of
running the family. The chief qual-
ity for which Clarence was hired was
that he had driven army mules willie
out swearing. This is enough to fur
nish plenty of comedy and funny sit—
uations, especially when Clarence ate
tempts to repair the plumbing and
tune the piano.

“Clarence" will be directed by Pro-
fessor J. P. Ryan, with the assistance
of Kenneth Geddes. The committee in
charge of the play consists of John
kingman, chairman, Ellcii Ulll, Amy
