POINT FOR DRAKE BATTLE

Pioneers Fear Oklahoma vlggle Team
The Week l-‘nlltmiug Jayhauk
Brittle fit Lawrence.

The Pioneer's w over Washington
last Saturday gave them a rating of
1000 with llissouri, Oklahoma Aggies,
and Kansas Aggies. Al. present Nee
hraska is climbing up from‘hor fall
at the hands of Missouri and stands at
750 with wins over Drake, Washing-
ton and Kansas U. Oklahoma took a
tumble to 50v but is expected to raise
'rather than lower this rating before
the season is over. Ame: has been
having a tough time since their first
win and now stands at 333. The Cy-
clone team is improving rapidly but
so far hasn't improved fast enough to
meet its opposition. Kansas ll., Drake,
and Washington are holding doivn the
cellar position but are entering aspir-
ations to do a little climbing within
‘Llle next two weeks.

Griunell Hus Three Grimes

Before the season cnds, Grionefl will
meet Kansas U oklahoma U. and
Drake, all on their home lots. Kansas
has met two of the toughest teams in
the Valley and has come out with de-
feats. Next Saturday they play Drake
at Lawrence and both teams are enter»
raining high hopes of victory. The
score in this game will take one of
these teams out of the non-rating
class. Kansas has a heavy line and
backfield, the latter being led by Zuh-
er and Wall uho arc husky as well
as men of experience.

The Oklahoma U. aggregation has
defeated Drake and has been defeated
by the Kansas Aggies. Drake, with
a green team, has been having a dis—
astrous season. Their one win over
Mississippi, a team which had the
weight but lacked the speed and ver-
satility which was necessary to stop
the Drake attack. The Bulldogs will
have a chance to show the results of
their experience received in nunrcon-
ference games when they meet Kansas
U. next Saturday.

Mare Hlu'd “'ork

The Pioneers are settling down to
two weeks of hard work in prepara~
tion for the Kansas game and will
open up on Kansas with an entirely
new‘offensive. In these two weeks
Coach Hyland will smooth out the fine
work which in the past has been ex»
ceptionslly good at times and again
rather ragged. There are no' serious
injuries in the line and when they
open upon the Jayhawks the forward
wall should be in a condition to cope
with any attack that any valley team
can put out. in the backfield. things
look rather rosy. "Butch" Meeter is
going good and Lamb's injured hand,
which has been interfering with his
passing for some time, should be in
good condition.

'A. McClain who has been
piloting Grinnell in the last few
games will be in good shape and
should be able to use his versatile at—
tack against Kansas as effectively as
ever. Besides the prospect of these
men being in good shape for the Kan-
sas game. the fact that West Stotts
will probably appear in a suit and in
condition to play in this game has
made football fans jubilant for the
past week. Stotts has been in Des
Names for treatment and if the docs
tors haven't gone entirely wrong he
should have two good knees under him
to use in his brilliant open field l'un—

.nlng when he appears in the Pioneer
line-up again.
Ilold ltigli IIopes

With all this in mind it is needless
to say that Grinnell is feeling good
about the prospect for a high Valley
rating. In fact, it is not hard to find
those who feel that Grinncll will end
the season rated at 1000. All eyes
are toward the Kansas game. and

cold weather proved no detriment to
good teams on Monday afternoon
when Harris Coggesball, '29, defeated
George Struble, ’28, in the finals of
the By "5 Cup tournament at the
Country club. Coggesball, holder of
both the Nebraska and Iowa state
championship titles, took charge of
the trophy by taking the matches at
7.5; 5-4; 6-4. 1
The game developed into hard ngr
ing contest between the two men.
Struble ran out the first game in
handy fashion, but Coggeshall retaliat-
cd by taking the next two, and the
score seevsawed back and forth until
at the score of heall when Coggeshftll
broke through Strubfe's service, and
then took his own for the first set The
second and 111le sets were almost
duplicates of the first, Wilh‘Lhe cham—
pion breaking through the defending
champ's seiyicc for the needed advant-
age. In the last set Struble aced
Cuggeshalf three times to take the
ninth game, bringing the count to 3‘5.
coggeshall won his own service, 4-1. to
take the tenth game and the match.
Statistics show that the game was
even closer than the set scores would
indicate. Little difference is shown
in the number of points accummulated
by each player.

The semi-final matches which the

had been expected. Coggeshall de-
feated Ted Lovejoy, '28, H, 5-4, 5-2.
Coggeshall was extended to his ut-

most interest to the student.

Ml' Hulbert will speak of the origins
of Japan, Korea, and China and the
bases of their culture, and will give
the reasons he has noted why Confuc-
ianism, Buddhism, and Shiiitoism are
incapable of surviving the impact of

Will Professional T lllllll

Francis “Hail" Moran, ’26, veteran
Grinnell football and basketball play'r
cr, is starring in the backfield for the
Frankford Yellow Jackets of the
Frankford Athletic Association in
Philadelphia.

Against Canton, Ohio, the biggest
team in the professional league, Moran
ran forty yards for a touchdown and
was the stellar light in the Yellow
Jackets' 17 to n in‘ctory. In the game
with the New York Bears, Moran made
half of the yardage gained and was
never thrown for a loss. The lone
touchdown in the HartfordaFrankford
game was tallied by Moran. In tho
victories over Akron, Ohio, and Buf-
falo. New York, Moran is said to have
been an outstanding player. Despite a
smashed jaw and minor injuries from
one of the recent games, lioran is ex~
pected to play in all of the remaining
contests scheduled by the Yellow
Jackets. His next appearance will be
against Providence, R. I.

Moi-an Is one of eighteen regulars
selected from a field of forty-four can—
didates for positions on the Frankford
team. He is signed up on a fifteen
week contract which began September
15th and which terminates December
12th, the date of the last Frankford
game. At that time he will probably
turn to professional basketball.

Twelve drinnelf men played their
last game of football on Ward ‘fielrl
last Saturday as the Pioneers downed
the Washington Bears 770, in a mud
battle which smacked more of a water
polo contest than the gridiron pas-
time. Captain Martin, \leeter, Mc~
Clam, Niblo, Peterson, Seeland, Weitz,
nincfort, Stotts, . cLain, Park and
Wolfe were the dozen men who made
their last appearance before their own
enthusiasts.

A hard drive in the first
quarter of the game gave the pioneers
the necessary points to add the win to
the fast growing column of victories
which the Pioneers have been piling
up. The only points of the game, came
at the start of the second stanza after
the scarlet—jersied boys had journeyed
through the Bear defense, by means of
a number of neat dashes and passes,
to the Washington 2-yord line. Here
a Grifmell pass fell into the waiting
arms of McClain, after a Bear back
had partly blocked the toss. ifeeter's
placekick was good for the extra point.

Hayes Looks Good

The major part of the game was
taken up with a punting contest be-
tween the Washington "backfield,"
Hayes, and lleeter, of the Pioneers.
The Eeftr‘s midget field-general had a
little the better of the argument from
the standpoint of distance, but the ace
curate placing of most of the Grinnell
kicker's boots more than counteracted
the distance lost. on three occasions
during the third quarter nfeeter klckr
ed the oval out of bounds inside the
Washington twelve yard line.

Mecter and Evalin did most of the
ball toting for the Pioneers, with
Hayes doing practically all of the
Washington offensive work, The Bear
quarterback figured in almost every
play engineered by the Washington
team. Time after time the little fel-
low hrokc tlirougb the Grinnell for-
wards for short dashes into Pioneer
territory, or returned iieeter's prints
for substantial gains.

Hold For Downs

The southern team had a decided
advantage over Gf'inl'lell during the
third period of play. In this period,
after an exchange of punts had netted
the Bears a considerable gain, and left
the ball deep in Grinnell territory,
Hayes and Whittier carried the pig-
skin to the Pioneer 2-yard line. The
Gl'inuell forwards held the Washing—
ton hacks for downs, and ifeeter's nice
punt relieved the nervous tension.

Two placekicks by ltfeeter were at
tempted, each of which missed the
mark. The first from the 3anrd
line in the first quarter was consid-
erably wide of the posts, and the sec-
ond, in the last few minutes of play,
was blocked by the Washington for

Mr. William Angus, director of dra—
matics. The three plays, "hidors to
the Sea," “The Man Without a Head,"
and “The Lost Silk Hat" were cost
after a tryout in which over one hun-
dred candidates participated. 0f the
twelve persons comprising the three
casts, only two, Paul Kenefick and
Robert Berry are known to Gl'l'nnell
audicnces. The others, six of whom

ment in the drama of horror. The act-
