“The pcolllc ol‘ America do hot.

Erttish composers or importance to
constitute a school of musicians: what
is called the Modern British School of
Musical Art," said Dr. G. Herbert

Knight presented iinisical selections

from the works cl seven modern Brit-

ish composers to illustrate his lecture

on "viewing and Reviewing Recent

British hlusical Art." ‘

"If the American does become ae-
quainted with British musicianship he
will say, ‘Why, Johnny. old top, I
didn't know you But now that I
know you well. I should like to bar—
row something irom you.‘ " Dr. Knight
declared. He recommended this
method or herrowmg tor both coun-
tries, saying that they have much to
otter one another in the musical iield.
”ii the two peoples were well informs
ed," he said, “we would not speak at
‘ilnmllsical Englisll,’ nor would they
call America ‘tlliz land ot commer-
cialized zil't.’

"America should adopt the English
method at encouraging widespread
musicianship. holding competitive
music testiials, periccting chorals in
church music, and encouraging native
musical talent," according to Dr.
Knight.
