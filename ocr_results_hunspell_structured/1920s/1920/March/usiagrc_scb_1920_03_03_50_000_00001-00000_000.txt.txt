UYBLUNES TAKE
FAST GAME BY
35-27 SﬂllllE

Wassenaar Stars f o r
Pioneers—Amos Out-
Scored in 2nd Half.

l

Iowa State College deieated the
Pioneers in a‘ well-played and hard—
tougbt basketball game on the Ames
court Saturday atternoon, the ﬁnal
count being 35 to 27. Incidentally it
was the ﬁrst Missouri Valley win for
the Cyclones, and the last appearance
of the Pioneers in a conference bas-
ketball game this year.

The Cyclones showed a reversal or
term, and displayed a basketball abil-
ity not even hinted at in the ﬁrst game
with the Pioneers. The Grinllell quin—
tet also played a greatly improved
brand of basketball,

The guarding or both ouiritets was
extremely close in the early stages ct
the battle, but loosened up towards
the end. giving how teams several
open shots at the hoop.

Pioneers Tulle Loud.

Tile Pioneers jumped into the lead
at the st,lrt ufrthc game, Shocsniith
tossing a goal from ﬁeld shortly after
the ﬁrst whistle. Sheppard also got
one through the ring, followed shortly
by another goal by lnncs. wassrnaar
evened the corrnt on a long shot none
the side at the court, and a moment
later put the Pioneers into the lead
with a foul throw, Ames then gath-
ered a series at baskets, rolling up
their total to 21 bciore the bait ended,
the Pioneers gathering it; points.

‘ Pioneers Stage Comeback.

Griunnll conic hack strong utter the
intoriu' 'on. and gave the Cyclones
a run for their money Wasscnaar
gathorcd several shots from long
range, and several counters by Shoe-
sniith and llerhrochtsiucycr gave the
Pioneers 17 points for the halt. The
Amos Quintet succeeded in scoring lGl
points, inakingthe total count 35 to 27 l

The teamwork of both teams was
good, although tumbling marred the
contest to some extent. ii'asscnnar;
was easily the star or the contest.
ringing up ﬁve ﬁeld goals, many oti
them from long range, besides tossing
in seven out at twelve toui tries. His
floor work and guarding were also
above par. Shoesmith played a good
passing game, also tossing in three
ﬁeld goals during the contest. Paige,
Sheppard and White played hest tor
the Cyclones, although the tormer did
not have his usual eye ior toul‘throws,

The game was played just hciore a
dual indoor track meet between Amos
and Minnesota, in which the Cyclones
easily defeated the Gophers.
