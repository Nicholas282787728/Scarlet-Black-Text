In hushed whispers the news spread
through the Quad—“Do you know
we're having the track meet tonight
Don’t tell the men!” stealthily the
crowd assembled under the cover of
the moonless night. By mental tele-
pathy, lest cheers should he‘heard
at the other side or the campus, they
urged on the ehmpions of their
classes.

meet. The sprinters sprinted valient-
ly and the jumpers jumped on the
illuminated runway (illuminated by
by the lights of two cars).
judges could not always see who won
the races, and true, some of the nin-
ners were lost in the darkness and
were not seen again for some time,
But the truest thing of all—contestants
and crowd alike broke all records
in the hundred in order to get in
before Mr. Johnson locked the doors.
Nevertheless, it was a very good track

meet.

The last meeting of the Science
Club was postponed from Monday evA

clock at the home or Professor \V. S.
