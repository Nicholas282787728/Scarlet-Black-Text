l . Twenty million peoplp of North‘
china are lacing starvation. The e.‘ ‘
tent and horror of this terrible ca-
lamity which has helallen these people‘
is hard to picture. The famine dis
trict includes a large part ol chihlr,
,Shmntuug, Honen and a small part or
‘shonsi. All the territory from the
‘ieilou River in tho sends to Muir
‘sulitt in the north, l'rcm Sheusi in the
west to the eastcin coast has had very
-iittle rain these last two years so that:
the crops for this whole district are‘
.veiy small.

We are living in the northwestern‘
part ol.‘ Shantung, right in the midst
.» of one of the worst famine distric
Our mission has work in seven coune
ties here with a population of some

300,000 people. It is about this sec»
itron of the lamine that 1 am writing
‘1 l for 1 know from ﬁl'sL-himd observation
.‘ ‘about the conditions.

The men of the station have just
been out in the ﬁeld distributins
.money for seed wheat. Many of the
small farmers with less than an acre
5 . per mouth were not able to buy wheat}

this fall. An organization in Pekiug‘
sent us $5,000.00 for this purpose, The
farmers here get two crops a year.
They plant wheat in the fall and get
an early spring crop. While we were
distributing this seed money we made
a survey of our seven counties.

500,000 Already Without Food.

The survey shows that 500,000 peo-
ple are already living on chaff, bark,
weeds, and roots. We estimate that
in two months 500,000 more will be in
need while hy the end of February
there will he a total of 1,500,000 in this
one district who shall have to receive
help or starve. Right at the harvest
season you could ride mile alter rnile‘
in the country and see only bare
ground. You can only realize what
this means when you remember that;
these people are all farmer and have,
no other means of support‘bnt their‘
'land. They depend on their crops for y
‘fuel as well as for food, for they burn .
;the stalks of “kao liang" which are
much like corn stains. No Chinese‘
jexcept the very rich expects to be‘
warm in winter. He merely hopes to
keep from freezing. Without this fuel‘
the suffer-lug will he terrible. This:
makes our- fifth year in China and we!
have seen much suffering but nothing}
:comparable to the tragedies of this
