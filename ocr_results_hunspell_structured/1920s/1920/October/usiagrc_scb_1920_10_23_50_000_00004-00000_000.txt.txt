IIO GOLLE 'E MEN THINK!

An editorial by Franklin G, nunhmn
Colunlhiit University
From the Knox student

At no time in the intellectual de-
veloprncnt of the citizens or our cuurr
try has the obligation or the college
and university towards politics been
so great. The guidance or the Ship or
State is in the hands of ruen who have
tried to sense public opinion in order
to make fair and equitable decisions
unsignalters oi public policy This has
always been so m our country and is
the secret of the permanence ot the
nation. Public opinion is largely gen»
crated by the attitude oi men for
whom the great masses at people
have sincerc admiration and unqual-
iired respect. How many men who
mold public opinion are products or
or are at present living in our great
college communities?

.lohn Erskine in “The Moral chir-
gation to the Intelligent" would have
those at us who have been trained at
great cost to pur iamilies, our-selves,
or university endowments, return in
some measure, the results oi that
training to the community in
which we li c_ the nation to which
we owe allegiance. This nation ﬂee
rnands ol us that we bear arms in
time or war; wiry can it not demand
that we use our nrinds in time or
peace? There are many minds whose
mental convolution are not attected
by evidence nor by the digging into
the propaganda or truth, tas the case
may be. behind it). Pr-opogands is
not always a whole cloth oi lies, but
its o gin does not bespeak its sin-
ctrity.

It is part of the training of the
college or university man to be in a
position to make 1le decision on the
basis of the facts in the case, What
those facts are can only he found by
a clear analytical study of the causes.
the occasions and the events which
have led up to the crisis lictore us in
the settlement of the greatest war the
world ever engaged itself in. For
what? For aggrsntlizcment, for im-
agined wrong, [or commercial su-
premacy of a group of nations, for re-
lpr-rsal on a warecrazed f0e~no, none
of these but tor the purpose of pre-
venting future wars in this world of
,onr-s where men might live together-
‘l’n peace, in perpetuating great corr-
(structive enterprises, living as God
‘wisbed his children to live.

Do college men mink? Yes, college
men are capable of thinking. They
are thinking in this great political
crisis when the world's security rests
on a preference in presidential candi-
dates in one country? Unless they do,
there is little hope from the university
and little hope that the rest of the vast
electorate will receive from the uni-
versity and college communities any
help, any guidance in making this na-
tion's Great Decision.
