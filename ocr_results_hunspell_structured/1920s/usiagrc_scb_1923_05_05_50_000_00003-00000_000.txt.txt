[TROUS oxide, accord-

ing to the science of a

century ago, was "the

principle of contagi n when le-

spired by animals in the minutes:
quantities.” Mere say-sol

Imaginative yet skeptical Hilm-
phrey Davy, who believed in ex-
periment rather than in opinion,
“respirad” it and lived.

It was this restless desire to test
beliefs that made him one of the
founders of modern science. Elec-
tricity was a new force a century
ago. Davy used it to decompose
potash, soda, and lime into potas-
sium, sodium, and calcium, thus
laying the foundations of electro-
chemistry. With a battery of two
thousand plates he produced the
ﬁrst electric arc ——harbinger of
modern electric’illumination and
of tbeﬁicctrlc fut-mice.

Czarﬁlexander I and Napoleon
met on a raft to sign the Treaty of
Tilsit while Davy was revealing

 

 

the effects of electricity on matter.
"What is Europe?” said Alexan-
der. “We are Europe.”

The treaty was at that time an
important political event, framed
by two selﬁsh monarchs for the sole
purpose of furthering their per-
sonal interests. Contrast with it
the unselﬁsh efforts of Sir Hum-_
phley Davy. His brilliant work
has resulted in scores of practical
applications of electrolysis in in-
dustry and a wealth of chemical
knowledge that beneﬁt not him-
self but the entire world.

In the Research Laboratories oi
the General Electric Company, for
instance, much has been done to
improve the electric furnace (at de-
velopment of Davy’s arc) and new
compounds have been electio-
chemically produced, which make
it easier to cast high-conducdvity
copper, to manufacture special
tool steels; and to produce carbides
for better arc lamps.
