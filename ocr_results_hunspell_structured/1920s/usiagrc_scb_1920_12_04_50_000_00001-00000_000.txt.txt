Popular Pianist Gives McDowell
Concert as Final Number on
Music Program.

The piano recital by Miss Augusta
Cottluw last night came as the creme
irrg feature of the past three days of
music. The concert was characteriz-
ed by Miss Coltlow's' ability to inter-
pret the hill meaning of story number-
she played. She added to the interest
of the program by giving a brief exe
planatiorr of Bach's “Toccata in C
‘rnai'or for the organ" transcribed by
Busoni, and Schumann's “Carnival
oh. 9”. In the tiist Miss Cottlow suce
crcdcd in making the piano seem irii
ly organ-like, the second exhibited
her amazing poetical feeling
rythmie sense. Special mention

’should be made of the three McDowell

pieces on her program. She is one
of the foremost exponents of his work

‘and has been instrumental in making

it known to the American public.
Miss Cottlow's gracious response to
circores and her seeming interest in
her audience contributed to the snap
cess of her recital.

a graduate of over 20 years ago, is re-

am not interested in this movement in

lege; it does not need any more

student in Grinnell College yesterday,
the statement was made that some oi

'Grinnell is rich and that this move-

that Grinnell is rich, it is very rich.
Its riches are beyond computation. All

that have been illustrated in the lives

that are here tonight. Pricelcss this

But that is not what the graduate
meant, who was talking to inc yester-
day. He meant that We were rich in
