the star of the meet by winning both

Recent discussion of the Oxford
academic system by the Oxford de-
baters aroused considerable com-
ment upon our campus. The concen-
sus of opinion seems to be that Oxford
custom of optional class attendance is
a laudable one, '

The creation of a “dean's list" at

and at the same time, an exceedingly

such a privilege to twenty members of

make the concession to all members of
the student body.

ngher education is not early so
universal in England as it is in Amer-

Grant the students of almost any of
our univer ties the privilege of read-

and it is safe to say that the schola —

beamed German Had Robbed Archives
of Famous European. Museums.

An extraordinary story of a learned
German who for years has robbed Eu-
ropeon archives or the precious docu-
ments which he, as an historian, was
permitted to examine, has come to
light in Berlin. The culprit is the hi -
torical scholar Karl Hauck. The police
raid on his flat reveals an extraordin-
ary collection which contains letter
from King Edward Vii, Frederick the
Great, William of orange, and Prince
Gorehakov, who seem to have been

favorites, There are also many sign-
ed photographs. impressions of his.
torlcftl seals, manuscripts and scores
of famous poets and musicians.

It is charitable to bone that some of
these have been honestly acquired, but
there can be no doubt that mnnv or

claimed to be writing a history of Ger-
man culture and was nllou-ed access
to official files in London, Vienna,

He might never have been suspected
had he been satisfied to keep his
manuscripts for his favorite diversion,
which consisted ‘in sitting with his eyes
fixed on the autograph of one of his fa-
vorite historical characters until the
lines were so fixed in his brain that he
could reproduce them and thus felthis

was forging.

Presently, however, he began to sell
some, and it was not long before the
director of’tlle Prussian State Archives
noticed an advertisement offering for
solo an historical manuscript‘wblch he
knew belonged in the state Archives at
Vienna. Inquiry at the Austrian capl-
tul brought the inforinntiou that the
document in question had been stolen.
