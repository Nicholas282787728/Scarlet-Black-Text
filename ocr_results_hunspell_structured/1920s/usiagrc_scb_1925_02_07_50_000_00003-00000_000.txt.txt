Worker—*brings the life—giving water from distant lakes
and rivers to rainless valleys, producing rich harvests
of fruits and vegetables, cereals and forage.

What electricity is doing for the farmer is C
counterpart of what it is doing for Industry, ’

How electricity does these things is important to the
student in a technical schoolibut what electricity can
do is important to every college man or woman, no
