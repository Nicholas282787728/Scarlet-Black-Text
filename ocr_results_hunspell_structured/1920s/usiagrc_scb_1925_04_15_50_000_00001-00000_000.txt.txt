The Macmillan company is shortly
to bring ,out a book which reflects
honor upon the author. professor Dnsc
hlell Stoops, and hence upon Grina
nell college. The book is called
“Ideals of Conduct: an Exposition of
Moral Attitudes," and has received
high praise from critics in the, philos—
ophical field, “There is no doubt that
the author has seized on an idea of
unusual sweep and quality," writes
one reviewer, "and there is no doubt
that he has been able to present this
idea in a popular and readable way.
The book is interesting as books on
ethics hardly ever are."

Professor Stoops' book falls into
three parts of which- the first deals
with the earliest moral empire, that
of the classical Greek and Hebrew
morality. Classical morality was Mr
jective. Iit includes the state, the
familv, property, religion. But the
classical systems tended toward rig-

When. therefore. the newer
unrversalis‘tic development took place,
the rigidity of the older morality drove
the newer conscience represented in
Greek philosophy. and in Christianity.
into an inner world of subjective more
ality. This is the second empire of
the book.

This subjective morality has ruled
the conscience of the West for 2000
years, but we are now coming to see
that the moral ideal for the future
cannot be detached and aloof from
objective scientific inter . s and so-
cial ends it will be an ideal which
is creative and which accepts and re-
molds all the objective aspects of
life, the state, the family, etc. This
is the third moral empire of the book.

history- of its organization. It was
decided at a business meeting held
last Monday night, that the club would
sponsor a large program of events to
be held on April 26, and to be called
Cosmopolitian Night.

The program will be staged on the
south campus which will he decorat-
ed suitably for the occasion. Ten or
twelve mixed items including songs.
feature dances. and special numbers
will be included in the evening's one
tcrtainmcnt as well as refreshments
served in the styre of an international
cafe. Each of the girls on the serving
committee will be dressed to represent
a certain nationality, The purpose of
Cosmopolitan Night, in the words of
John Thornton, president of the club,
“is to place the cosmopolitan idea and
spirit before the whole college.” Pre-
vious attempts to accomplish this end
have all been inside activities. and the
officers of the organization feel sure
that an outdoor' program will prove a
successful varation from the pro-
grams of past years This year's
Cosmopolitan Night will be successful,
quoting \fr. Thornton again, “if the
Grinnell people will realize that the
spirit of the club is one of special
helpfulness to foreign students and
friendship to all students in genera
