Both Teams Work at
Top Speed — Final
Score is 18-15.

in a game featured by the fast floor
work and close guarding of both
teams, the Pioneers defeated the Des
lioines if. M. C. A. quintet by an
18 to 15 Count in the Men's Gymnas-
iuni Saturday night. both teams work—
ed at top speed throughout the own
test, and on several occasions time
had to be called in order to give the
.players a chance to rest.

The teamwork of the Pioneer squad
Wis vastly better than that shown in
the Penn game, and most of Grinneli’s
goals came on shots resulting from
working the ball down the ﬂoor. The
close guarding of the Crinneli guards
iorced the Des Moines aggregation to
fall back on long tries at the basket.
few of which went through the hoop.

Grinnell scored ﬁrst when the Plo—
neers worked the ball dow'n to their
buket, Evans registering a held goal.
The “Y" team gained a short-lived
advantage when Knox and. North gal-A
neredl a long shot apiece. Two goals
from fouls by Evans evened the count
and the Pioneers shot into the lead
on a ringer by Shoesmith, holding
their advantage throughout the rest
of the contest. The score at bali
time was 14 to 11 in favor or the

‘ Pioneers.

Des Moines succeeded in getting an
even break in the second half, both
teams gathering four points. Evans
made two field goals near the begin—
ning of the half, while Somers added
two points to the Des Moines total
by dribbling the ball the length of
the door and registering a ﬁeld goal.
Knox succeeded in making good two
of his ﬁve tried at foul ’goals, bring-
ing the ”‘1” total to 15. 'The guard—
ing of both teams during the second
half was remarkably close.

Seniors is Shir.

The work of Evans and Shoesmith
. at forwards, together with Winter's
ability at breaking up the passes of
the Des bioines team, teatured the
game. Somers, a former Pioneer star,
performed up tohis old standard and
proved to be the best man for the
visitors. Knox was the main cog in
the offensive work of his team, getting
seven of the ﬁfteen points. Alex Mil—
ler, another former Grinnell basket

man, played a good game at guard.

Strong Team.

Gi'iniicll’s basketball team journeys
In Manhattan, Kansas, this week end,
Where they are billed to engage the
Kansas Aggigcs in a two gemo ser
Friday and Saturday nights, The team
will probably leitvc here Thursday,“-
tel'noon, making an over-night trip to
the Aggie school.

The two gmnes this week will open
the Missouri Valley Season for the
Pioneers, and will'pit them against
one of the strongest teams in the mid—
dle west. Last year the Aggies Won
the Missouri Valley basketball chm-
pionship, and with the loss of only one
regular they are back in the race this
year. Should the Pioneers win either
of the two games, it will give them a
big chance of coming out well in front
in the conference race.

The lineup which will start against
the Aggies will probably be the same
as that which played the Des itoines
game, although seven or eight men
will be taken on the trip. Coach
Compton has succeeded in getting the
men to work together exceedingly well
in a. short space oi time, and is still
working to perfect the teamwork, as
well as the otfenslvs power of the
squad.

The next game on the schedule atter
the Aggie series is with Drake on the

Add Mathematical
Classics to Library

Many Mathematical texts, including
some of the Classics in the history of
the subject, have been added to the
College Library recently. Among the
number are copies of Descartes Ger
ometry and Wallis' Algebra. There
are also a number of recent Math-
ematical treatises now at the Library.

Descartes work was published in
the original in 1637, but other editions
have been made in Latin, the book now
in the College Library being a copy-
of the ﬁrst Laun edition. Wallis’
Algebra was published in 1685, Both
are among the classical Mathematical
treatises.

Diphtheria Causes Scare Thruout
College — Resumption of
Chapel Uncertain” .

The threatened epidemic of a mild
form of diphtheria which caused
the shut down of chapel and vesper
services since Sunday has been avert-
ed wlthout the development of a sin»
gle clinical case.

No deﬁnite announcement as to when
the chapel services will be resumed
can be made at this time, but it is
probable that the hrst service will be
held Friday morning.

Only one new carrier was discov~
ered in the tweuw»lour hours ending
last night and none have ‘devhlcped
today.

At the present time there are six-
teen girls conﬁned in the Quadrangle
lntirmary classed as carriers of the.
disease. None of them are sick in
bed. Cultures are being taken as often
as it is possible and as soon as a suf-
ficient number of negative tests are
procured for any case the girl is dis-
missed.

The dormitories have not developed
a single case that showed positive by
the diphtheria test.

Gladys Wold who was the ﬁrst to
‘Show a positive test was removed to
the Community hospital together with
her sister who also showed a positive
test, Both have been transferred to

he Quadrangle indrmary. Neither are
clinical cases.

Handling the situation from the
medical standpoint has been greatly fa-
cilitated by the fact that the Commun-
‘Ity hospital basabranch of the State
Board or Health’s Laboratory. Diph-
theria cultures are handled here in a
third of the time it would have taken
it they had been sent to Iowa City.

Medical men say that there is a
,state-wide epidemic of a very mild
)form of diphtheria at the present time.

BeSldes basketball classes, gymnasium

have an nitcrclasss series extending

While those class games are primar»
ily for the two lower classes, "Doc"
Hult, athletic director, urges that the
upper classes organize teams to cum—
pets in the series, In this Wity a num—
ber of men can be receiving the bene-
ﬁts of athletic training, instead of the
comparatively few who parti ipate in
varsity sports. This winter's class
series is in no way intended to take
the part of the regular class series
abandoned because of the coal vaca—
tion, but is intended merely as a plan
oi reaching .is many or the strident
body as possible.

The rcgilar class series will be
played at the end of the‘ varsity sea-
son, each class'as usual putting one
team in the held, The inter—class
series is an annual feature of the
Crinnell indoor season, and has served
as an excellent means of Securing ma-
