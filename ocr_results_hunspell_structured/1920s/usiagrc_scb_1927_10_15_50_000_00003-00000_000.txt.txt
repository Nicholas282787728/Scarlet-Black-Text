Alumnus Cannot Perceive Radical
Changes Predicted For
1927 Football.

“I can't see that the new rules have
had mllch effect on football so for,"
declared an alumnus who has been a
close student or football games for
twenty years, after the game with
Kansas two weeks ago. ”From all that

I had read in the papers and nlnga- ,

zines. by sportsrwritcrs and the fool.-
ball experts, I expected that I would
hardly recognize the football games
this fall for what they were, but so
far they scem to lollow tho slime old
conservative lines. And from what I
have read in the New York papers
about the university games in the cost.
the same situation prevails thel lid
probably everywhere."

The new rules to which this gmdllr
ate refers are, first, the liberation of
the backward and lateral pass from
the penalty of a fumble which up to
this season prevented general use of
any but forward passes. which when
grounded or incomplete were returned.
It has been the opinion of many Wri-
«ters on football that the unsllackling
of the backward and lateral pass
would open up a whole new system of
attack, but so far Vrey little seems to
have been done in this direction. It
is probable that no clinch is Willing to
risk an untried method so early in‘ the
season. It is possible also that the
new attack Will not be developed until
some genius arises among the coaches
Who sees and can put into practice all
the opportunities that the new ruling
permits.

Puss, Shirt Not Sensational.

When the forward pass came into
the game some twenty years ago, it
made no stir, except on paper, and it
was a guild many YEEFS before the pass
became an accepted element in the at-
tack. The same is true of the Shift.
and of many other features ol the
game which are now fundamental.
"We are apt to be surprised one or
these days,” said the graduate who
was interviewed, “by some team. in
some part B! the country, unloasing a
whole new strategy based on the lat-
eral pass. Once that hnppens every
university, college, and highrscbool
team in the country will begin to who
it up, and coaching schools will be
crowded with men Who want to learn
all about it.”

The other new rules to which he re—
rerred are the limit or the “huddle" ior
signals to thirty seconds; the require—
ment that after shifting Positions for
attack the playcrs‘shsll remain mu—
tionless tor onc second, and the move
ing 01 the goal-posts back of the field
of play a distance of ten yards.

The thirty second limit has been en-
forced to any great extent so far, alr
though the buddies, declared Out

First Game In West Was Played

In Year 1889.

The present tield is at least the third
on uhicli Grinnell has played football
in the nearly forty years which have
clasped since the first intercollegiate
game in thc west was played on the
Gl'innell campus. That game, played
with the State University at Iowa in
1889, and won by Grinncll by a large
margin, was played on the center chm-
pus, north or Blair hell (at that time
a new building about where the ting
pole and the groups ol oak and birch
trees now stand.

Football was played on the campus
for several years, until the ground
north or eighth avenue was secur.ed
The football field was originally some
distance west of the present field. and
was located about where the grand‘
stand is now. In 1912 the present
ﬁeld Was laid out and the concrete
stadium built. The approved campus
plans call tor a gymnasium and fields
house to he built near the field as
soon as funds are available.

The name ”Ward lucid" is in honor
of e Piuneer athlete, a. member of the
class of 1390, who died soon after
graduation, but who loft zln impress on
the college of splendid character and
fine sportsmanship which has been
permanent.

Have Much Space.

Few colleges or universities have so
much space available for football Drac-
tice as Grinnell. In addition to the
main gridiron, there is e practice
field at the north end of Ward Field;
room for two squads to practice on
Freshman held near the men's halls;
room for another squad east of the
baseball diamond on Tenth avenue,
and at the south end of Ward Field
there is room for still another practice
gridiron. Six scrimmage: between
twelve teams may be carried on simul-
taneously. with no possibility of inter-
ference. ‘
