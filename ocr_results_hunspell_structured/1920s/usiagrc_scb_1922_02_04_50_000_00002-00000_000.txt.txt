PEACE AT LAST!
Elsewhere in this issue there will
be found 9. statement of the new
“quiet" rules adopted by the lions
Senate for the dormitories. The for—
mulation and acceptance of such a set
of regulations is the ﬁrst step in a
coordinated government for the men's
buildings and promises to be one of
the most constructive bits of legisla—
tion that the Senate has attempted, or
successfully concluded.

Since the dormitories were built,
there has been a. distinct feeling that
the men were selﬂgoveming and that
they should have a free hand in form-
ing their own disciplinary measuresl
And this has been the case. While
there have been suggestions as to pos»
sible rules, in the main there has
been autonomy in the government of
the men, ’with fairly satisfactory re-
sults. However, there was always
some complaint as to the lack of uni—
formity in the rules of the various
units and the frequent discrepanci
caused considerable friction between
individuals, and thus between groups.

' Under the new system, this should be
done away with automatically.

The new ruling prescribes deﬁnite
hours for quiet and provides a means
for the entorcement of this action in
a uniform manner. The law apparent-
1y has teeth enough 'to be effective. If
such is the case, and the Senate seems
desirous or living up to its legislation.
then it should be a great aid in the
bettering of conditions in the men's
quarters and should also be effective
in raising the scholastic standards.

The Senate, by working out. mis
system, has proven that it is an active
ioree in Dormitory life. It next re-
mains to be seen whether or not it
has enough tome and is sufficiently]
sincere to apply the rule and make
it stick.

One of the most stubbornly fought
battles in the history of Grinnell is
that being conducted daily between the
Service in Herrick Chapel and Alumni
Recitation Hall. Since the two come
simultaneously, and both have their
adherents, there seems to be some lit—
tle anxiety as to the dual outcome.
The fortunes of war vary a good deal
and there seems to be considerable

large portion of it was compused of
ministers and townspeople who had
been attinclcd by the Sulvicc. The (its
teilrlziiice of students was decidedly in
the minority. This might be accounts
ed for by two things, either other du-

ties or complete indifference.

It is natural that the student who.

has a good deal to do should miss
Chapel part of the time, altho that

_does not change the fact that he loses , mite amang the minority In the seas

retailing the latest scandal or going
into lengthy personals, is to he placed

in another class. The value 0! time

so spent is it variable but undoubted
1y it must be worth While, considering
the number of A. R. H. advocates.

The Chapel scm‘ce should be sig-
niﬁcant .to every student, either as a

place for insplration or as a place

where he may acquire a number of in-
teresting bits of information about
the world's aflzlil‘s in general.
Grinnell type oi service is one of the
unusual features of the college here
and should be regarded as u privilege,
not a duty.

PAPAL ELECTION CAUSES SPLIT
IN ITALIAN CABINET

The Italian cabinet has resigned as
a result of dissension arising over the
election of a Pope to succeed the late
Bcncdict xv. The entire governmen—
tal body, including the cabinet and
the deputies, has been split by the pin»
posed official recognition of the death
of the Pope and the withdrawal of
Premier Bonomi has effectually stop-
ped all advances, for the time being
at least. In the meantime, the card—
inais have been isolated and the ﬁrst

FRANCE ACCEPTS INVITATION I'D
GENOA CONFERENCE

A recently issued statement by Pre-
mier Poincare announcing that France
would attend the allied economic con—
ference at Genoa has been a surprise
to European and American authori-
ties. This notion seems to point to a
desire to participate in the work of
the conference and an anxiety not to
block the conierence. It is feared
that the resignation of the Italain
cabinet may cause the postponement
of the conference from March 8 to
a later date.

about not because the members wished
‘to stop war but because no nation
dared refuse the invitation to consid-

told oi the present ﬁnancial condition
of the United States, dwelling on the
effect of tax-free securities in the
hands of the wealthy, and he credits
ed these conditions with fostering the
organization of the contercnc’e.

The conference has had a nllmhcr of
good results, according to Mr. Ingr
linln, who considers the meeting more
of a move to reduce expenditures
rather than to stop war, and he nam~
ed the agreements in Paciﬁc affairs
as among the chief or these. He con-
tends that the Paris treaty was in re.
