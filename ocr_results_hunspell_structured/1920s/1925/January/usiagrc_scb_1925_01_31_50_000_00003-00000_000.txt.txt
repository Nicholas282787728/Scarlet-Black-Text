For years track coaches the country
over have contended that the proper
way to run was on one's toes. Then
Paavo Nun'ni, the "Phantom Finn” be-
gan to absorb the athletic limelight by
winning any race ironi one to ten
miles in length, and breaking so many
records that he himself cannot count
them, and people began to notice that
he didn't run according to Hoyle, hiit,
disregarding tradition, ran ilattoote
Yet he certainly produced results.

Now comes whiter Christie, the vet-
eran track coach at the Univers y oi
Calliornia who says that Nlinni‘s way
is the proper way. He says: “For ov-
er 20 years 1 have argued that for di
tanees at over a mile, datiooted I'll!!-
ning is the best. Running on the toes
for two miles is bound to he a stinin
on the muscles oi the legs.” From tho,
records that Niunii has made, it would
seem that Christie is right.

Although Nul‘llli is “105'. noted [01'
his distance running, he is also the‘
champion sprinter of his country. HOWV
ever, Charlie Paddock is not afraid Of
him. and has uttered to race him in
Faddock’s specialty, the 100 yard dash}
and give him 2!. handicap of five yards.
Paddock is good, there is no doubt at
it, but five yards Bill Of a hundred is
quite a handicap.

 

Now that the 1924 iootbau sensiln is
ii thing oi the past, the big universi}
ties oi the country are beginning to}
count the profits oi the reason. The ,
University oi Pennsylvania has just,
announced a net proﬁt of $255,595 fol“
the season. {I‘lie total receipts iroin the‘
games were $501,442.37, and the expeii- ‘,
ses including the gunmn'ees paid to
vi ng teams amounted to 324239733 ‘
In at Y. M. C. A. game in Chicago re-‘
ccntiy, a forward on one at the teams
made so baskets in the one game, and
his team won, 130 to 20.
_most inconceivable, but: at that he had
trather hard luck, for his fifty field
goals merely tied the world's record
for baskets made in one game. The
record was formerly held alone by en-'
other Chicago man. I

Turning our attention to local oi-
inirs. it appears that instead oi a short-
age of inward material, Couch mack
nill have an overabundance oi ion,
wards next semester. Boiling and
Chase have developed during the past,
month better than was expected, and,
