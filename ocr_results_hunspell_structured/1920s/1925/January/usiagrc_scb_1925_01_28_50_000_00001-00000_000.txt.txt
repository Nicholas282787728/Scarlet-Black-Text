On Saturday the Pioneers meet the
Kansas Aggies here in what promises
to be one of the fastest and best
games of the season. The Wildcats
are now rating fourth in the valley
with two lost and one game won while
_Grinntell is at sixth place with two
wins and two losses.

In spite of the fact that the Kansas
Aggles defeated Kansas University. a
decided upset in Valley basketball,
.they have since shown nothing so or-
ceptional. It is true that they de-
feated Drake 33 to 17 which seems to
give them a decided advantage over the
Pioneers but they were held to a 33 to
19 score by Arnes whom Grinnell de-
tested 32 to 15. This fact would seem
to give the teams an even break with
no great advantage either way.

Bunker and Byers, the two star
forwards of the Aggie team form the
bulk of the offense. Bunker counted
eleven points against Kansas, nine
against Arnes and rang the bell for
eighteen points in the Drake game.
Byers his running mate made eight
against Amos and eleven points in the
Bulldog fray. There is no denying
the tact that these men get as hot as
a mid summer day. as they did in the
Kansas and Drake games. and the
Scarlet and Black team will have to
muzzle these two wildcats if they ex-
pect to win. Captain Doolan, guard
for the Aggies is a defensive star and
usually counts a basket or two in the
course of a game.

Amos Victory Encouraging

The Ames victory is looked upon as
a good omen by the Pioneer supporters
and perhaps it is what the team needs
ed to give them confidence. They
have been taking the usual workouts
against the frosh this week and should
‘he in fine fettle against their old foes
by Saturday.

Coach Black has been drilling the
men on offensive work and is groom-
ing his two Soplloinorel‘nrwards. Duff-
ing and chase. to work with Moran.

Lamb and Larson will be eligible
after the end of the semester and
this will considerably strengthen the
Pioneer five. Both rim good val
material and will giro some of
present players a hard fight for
berth on the team.

farmers. with none at the pivot pos-

Among the many old books now on

which was published in 1494.

The work mentioned above was one
on geometry, written in Latin by Lu-
cas de Borgo San Sepoecbo. There is
figuring on one of its pages that was
probably done by some scholar of that
Lime. Another volume on plane and
spherical geometry, also in Latin, was

1printed at Basileao in 1561.

another is the Norwich Connecticut

The volumes, many of which are

Grinnell Quintet Holds
Game; Comes Bac

The pioneer cagcrs successfully em-

they outclassed and ontlought the
Allies basketball team, 32 to 15, in a
one sided game on the Ames court
Saturday night.

Grlnnell held the load throughout
the game, but Arnes kept the score‘
lnil‘ly close in the first half. Doffing
found himself in this period, and made
three long shots from near the center
of the floor which greatly aided the
pioneers in maintaining their lead.
The score at half time was 12 to 3 in
favor of the Scarlet and Black team,

The Grinnell five spurted in the sec-
ond frame, and had no difficulty in pile
ing up the score. The play of the
Cyclones became ragged and they mis‘

TALKS MUMANBE’:

Milo v Hfu-L'm Tells Business Club of

Company.

“A Corn State Romance" was the
subject of the talk which Mac. v. Har-
lan, advertising manager of the Rolls
ins Hosiery Mills of Des Moines gave'
before the Business Club last Sunday'
afternoon.

Mr. Harlan is one of those men who
believes that there is more romance in‘l
business than in fiction. His cums:
pany, he told the Business club. was_
organized in 1892 when a number of;
Des Moines investors in a “blue sky"
corporation were left with a factory‘
,building on their hands. The mills
have grown now, from a start of a fewI
hand operated machines and a dozen
or so workers. to scores of efficient
machines and hundreds of workers.‘
housed in five separate buildings.

The development of this primarily.
leastel-n industry of hosiery making in
an town city was made possible by
several factors. in the first place,‘
the Rollins brothers. who control the‘
mills, were admirably qualified to)
work together, and manage things by;
cooperative methods. Moreover, the:
poll ~ of the company has been to cm
ploy only those girls who come from
the better class of homes A third
factor has been the immense amount
oi advertising which the mills have‘
done.

Clliiligotl Trademark A

The Des lloines man traced for his
listeners the steps which were taken
in order to change the name of their
product from “Armor-Plate" to "Roi-y,
ilns Hosiely." The trademark was
changed because in this day of silk‘
he or "Armor—Plate" was too slig«
gestne 05 the coarse knitted stockings
of other days which have long since
been displaced by the lighter silks and
iisies.

On being asked, in the round table,

upon what things the success of the
advertising man depended. Mr. Har-
lanreplied,“l believe that ten per cent‘
of success depends upon imagination‘
and proper college training. The‘
other ninety per cent consists of good‘

hard work."

Asset-ts SoundneSS of
Student Criticism

(New Student)

Those who debate the right at
students to “criticise the curriculum"
or “education" and question the wis-
dam of this criticism must he very
liliml if they cannot see that this criti-
cism cannot help going on all the
time, whether wise or not, whether
justiﬁed or no.

"Did you get anything out of that
courel”

“No, not much. He's soft."

"ought 1 to take that course?”

“Well, he’s a. tough and sour old
bird; bllt, believe me, he knows his I
stuff. You’ll get more out of him in a
semester than most of them can give
you in a year.”

”What do you think of my schedule?
I think i have a nice bunch of snaps."

"Yes, but you’re so loaded up with
two-hour courses that you're going to
ﬁnd yourself running around in little
sections."

Will any one maintain that these
snatches of campus conversation are
anything but ’crilicism of the cur»
rlcultlm’ and of 'edueation’? All the
critical accessories are her : a per.

sonal viewpoint, standards of taste.
background of culture, etc.

As criticism it is crude, but not dis»
honest. At bottom no student is very
stupid about what is good for him. if
he chooses wrongly it is usually be—
cause his motives are impure. The
snob looks for snaps, the grind for
nheezes, the 'chemistry honud’ for
chemistry.

Nor is the student in complete ignor—
ance about his instructors. It does
not require a volume of psychology to
determine who is blufflng, and who is
worthy of respect.
