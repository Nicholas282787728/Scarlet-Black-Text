EXPEHHAEJAL PLAYS

“Tile Farce of Master Pull-01in” and
“Tile )[0urners" Are Pints of
An Unusual Type.

a

Work on the Experimental theater-
plays which are to be presented De—
cember l is progressing rapidly, and
,the casts are working especially hard
to interpret the true meaning of these
two unusual plays,

"The Farce of Master Pathelnl," an
old French piece, 1 one of the first
examples of realistic farce which
flourished widely during the middle
ages. This production, which dates
back to the middle of the fifteenth
century, has often been revived, and
is still played occasionally in France,
The play production classes are try
ing to copy closely the original set
and presentation which was crude
and simple in its naive attempt to
represent at one time all the scenes
of the play. The play itself is an
ttlnnsing entertainment ftnd provides

excellent characterization.

The story of the play is centered
around a shrewd lawyer without conr
science or scruple who cheats at mer-
chant. The lawyer and his wife out
wit thrs sanre merchant, who later
deprived of justice in a suit against a
shepherd, by this same crafty lawyer.
The lawyer, however, gets his due
from the simple peasant whom he de-
fended in the suit.

The Mourner by James Mahoney
was first produced at Harvard by the
«17 Workshop in 1922. Pierrot, the
central figure in the fantasy, urged on
by Columbine undertakes to climb to
the moon. He climhs up and up un»
til he is a tiny speck against the
moon. Suddenly he falls and lies
crumpled and dead at the foot of thc
ladder. Mephistophelcs than comes to
say that the moon is nothing but a
piece of green cheese. This is the
mere stun', but there is more to the
play than that. Pierrot is the es-
sence of Youth with dreams and lie
lusions that are deprived expression
in our prosaic world of routine where
climbing to a moon of solid gold is
the acme of position in life.

Both plays are excellent for young
actors. The fftrce has a spirit of role
licking fun, and the fantasy is of and
for youth.

FUNERAL HITES PUH

hiual Tributes I’ d forulay After-
uobu to Pro' soar Paul Peck, Lute
Ileud oi history Iiept.

By a special memorial chapel sere
vice in tile morning, by a suspension
of classes for the rest of the day and
by a large attendance at the funeral
services held in Herrick chapel in the
afternoon, the facility and student
body paid filial tribute to Professor
Paul 17‘. Peck, who died last Friday at
Evanston.

The men’s glec club opened the
morning chapel period by singing a
Crinncll song composed by Professor
Peck, “Our College is Our Castle." Dr.
Cecil Fair-fax lavell, one of Mr,
Peck's colleagues in the history de-
partment and his successor as its
chairman, followed, with a short but
touching tribute to the deceased in-
structor and his sweetness of char
acter. President .1. H, '1‘, Main offer
ed prayer.

Following the chapel exercises no
classes met for the remainder of the
day.

The funeral was held from Herrick
chapel at 2:30 o'clock, Monday after-
noon, As the funeral party proceeded
down the central aisle, the men‘s glee
club sang "0h Master, Let Me Walk
with Thee," accompanied by H. W.
Matlack on the organ. Mr. Peck was
a member of the glee club during his
own undergraduate days.

Following a scripture reading and
prayer- by Professor Edward A. Stcine
er, Preeidcnt Main spoke simply and
moviugly of the influence for good
which Professor Peck el'tcd on the
life of crrnncli. He sard, “I think
the 21 years of work which our parts
nor has given to this college; a man
devoted to the principles of truth,
riehieousuess and ultimate goodness
of the ynullg people with whom he

with the speedball tournament over
and the championship cup residing in
Dibble hall for another year, the Scar-
lct and Black has endeavored to pick
an all-dormitory team, The selection
of this team has been difficult as all
the buildings were represented by
many excellent players and because of
the equal ability of so many men it
has been necessary to name two
teams.

on the first team Six and Three
lead with the number of men. each
building landing three places. Clark
hall came next with two men while
Buildings One, Two and Four placed
one man each.

Tailor s Center

The center positron on the first
team was awarded to Morgan Taylor
of Three. nis playing during the se-
ries was one of the features of Build
in; Three's offense and he was large-
ly responsible for his team's excellent
showing. No other center displayed
the ability to follow the hall as Ta
lor did, and his all round playing
caused lllm to star in every contest,
Lair-d of Four is given the center po-
,'tion on the second team.

Peterson of Three, Mondt of Two,
and coggeshall and Nicolet of Six are
the class of the forwards, although
they were closely pressed by Chase
and Moore of Six, Culver of Three,
and Guild of Two, All these men are
capable of giving their opponents
plenty of trouble and have been the
offensive power of their tcam during
the tournament. However the work
of the first four slightly over-shadows
that of the latter group. especially in
their ability to chalk up points.

Three Good Hﬂlﬁiiwlis

The three halfback positions on the
first team were given to Schill of
Four, Beck of Five and Smiley of Six.
The duty of the halfback is to feed
the ball to the forwards and these
men filled their position creditably.
Burt of Six, and Bauer-hach and Hall
of Five are other good halfbacks hut
the speed of the fir-st three gives them
slight edge.

Becker of Three and Bradstreet of
One are the pick of the full hacks.
Their ability to boot the ball out of
the danger zone and their clever de-
fensrve play kept their goal line from
being crossed on severill occasions.
Schroer of Three and Campbell of
One also show-ed good form,

Goal heferulcrs Strong

The position of goal guard was
hard to choose as each team possess-
ed a good defender, hut Patton of
Five and Timbrel of Two stand out
from the rest, with Patton the choice
for the first team. Lambly of Six is
not far behind and much credit should
hc given him for his strong defensrve
play.

The success 0! the Speedball scries
can be measured by the closely con-
tested ganres and the keen spirit of
rivalry which existed among the build,
lugs_ Team captains and Manager
Bauerllllcll are to be congratulated for
handling the tournament in such an
cflicicnt manner and for the sports-
rnaullkc actions of their plnyc"

lie was born in Marietta, Ohio, the
son of an editor and publisher but as
a boy ire displayed rnrrsical talents
that caused him to be sent to Europe
where he studied under Joachim,
Thompson and Leopold Aucr, who is
said to be the greatest violin teacher-
of modern times.

Won Grand Prix

When he was sixteen he won the
Grand Prix at the Brussels Royal
Conservatoire, together- with the Van
Hal cash prize of $5,000. He then made
his debut in London and from the Den
of Robin Leggee, noted English critic,
received this opinion: "I believe that
Macmillen will go farther and stay
longer than any of the present day
\'iolinists,7ztt top form he is without
a peer among living players."

His performances in England won
him the friendship of the late Lady
Palmer, a patron of the arts, who
save him a Stradivarius violin which
is thought to be one of the two finest
known, the other being in possession
of the Spanish crown and used only
by Sar-asate. The violin bearing the
inscription “Antonio Stradivarius
Cremom, 1721," originally cost 3,000
pounds and is now valued at $30,000.

Cited by I’crshiug

Macmillen received a citation from
General Pershing during the war be
cause of his “conspicuous arid meri-
torious scrviee," as a lieutenant in the
United States army. Following the
Armistice he tour-ed through France
and Italy at his own expense playing
for the wounded at hospitals.

When he returned to America, Mac-
millcu appeared with the thtionfll
Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Dodanz-
kv conducting, in thc Coldmark Con—
ccl‘to, at Carnegie hall. It was one of
the triumphs of his career, the late
if. E. Krohbicl in the New York Tr-ie
bunc, saying of his his performance.
“It was thoroughly fine and profound-
lv art. The playcr - noble tone,
lofty serenity, and l‘l poscful con-
quest of the technical difficulties
urakcs his playing of tlrc u ork a dis-
tillctly notahlc achievement."

last evening for St. Louis where they
will meet Washington U. on Thurs-
day. This game marks the finale for
both teams and each is pointing for
a victory.

Injures on Boill Tennis

Both outfrts have gone through
hard campaigns alld'huve suffered
from injuries, Grinnell entering the
game minus the services of Sceland
and Cathcart at guards, and with
Wing only in fair shape. il'ashington
has been handicapped in the last two
starts by the absence of fullback
Levy, star punter- and defense man,
but it is expected that he will be back
in unifo'rm against the Pioneers.

In Hayes, the Tikers have a star
quarterback, who has proven very ef-
fective this season, He is the most
powerful man on the Red. and Green
team, being a clever open field nut-
ncr and an expert line plunger. The
Pikers boast two flashy ends in Avis
and McCarroll, Both are good de-
fensive men and the former is adapt
in receiving passes, and on getting
down under Levy's long punts. The
main job of the Pioneers will be in
watching Levy and Hayes. who have
home the brunt of, the Piker attack
this fall. Capt. Levy, has been cred—
ited with some of the “ingest kicks in
the Valley this year.

Hope for Dry rich]

Both Hyland and Higgins will run
in their best scoring combinations in
an effort to end the season with a
victory. A dry field is the hope of
both teams as each has had to play
the majority of their games under ad-
verse weather conditions.

This game mar-ks the final appear-
ance of fifteen Scarlet and Black men,
who will he lost by graduation or in-
elgihility. These are: Capt. Sweet,
Wing, Moran, Martin, Carl, Howarth,
Moyer, Morris, Scharnweber, Dare,
Gates, McLain, and Braden. Cathcart
and Sceland, will see their last game
from the sidelines, both being injur-
cd to such an extent that they will not
be in uniform. w
