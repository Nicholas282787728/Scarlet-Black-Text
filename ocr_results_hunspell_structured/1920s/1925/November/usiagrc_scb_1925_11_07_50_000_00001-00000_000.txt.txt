To (‘i-cate Interest

' been held between two of the societ-

ies but since their abandonment this
fall it was necessary to arrange for a
new way of staging the debate. In

ive council of the Crinncll Forensic
decided to hold the contest between
the buildings, and to further stimur
late interest to hold all contests, ex-
cept the finals, iii the club gooms.

Englishmen Experienced

The Englishmen will present a for-
midable lineup. Michael Ramsey.
captain of the team, has been cun-
neeted with Cambridge all his life
both as his home and as his univciu
sity. He has spoken regularly at de-
batcs since coming to the university
on questions of modern democracy,
imperialism and liberalism, I-le has
been active in local politics and has
already declined, for the present, an
invitation to stand for thc House of

Geoffrey Lloyd, a former president

The uullslull features of the 1927
Cyclone will be stressed in the sales
campaign which will be launched
next 'l'uesda . Pictures of every Junr
ior and sin or in Grim-tell will ap.
pear, the senior section being fea-
turod, The plan in having pictures of
cvei-y one in the two ripper classes is
to make it more of “Evel‘yl)ody.'s Cy-
clone" than it has been in other years
so that it will be a real memory book.

The design of this year's book
should surpass many of those in the
past because the editorial board has
secured the services or the designer
whose work had a great inﬂuence in
determining the Missouri annual as
the winner in the 1923mm national
yearbook contest.

Persﬂilml llulllor Section

Another feature of the book will be
a big humor section, always lile‘eclae
ted by the students, which will be
quite personal in its nature.

Every Crinneilian in Who‘s Who
will have his picture in the Cyclone:
and the pictures and write~iips o:
Grihnell's twenty most famous atllr
[letogwill also appear.

Voting for the beauty contest con-
ductod by the Cyclone will start at
the time of the subscription cflme
paign Tuesday. The plan oi the
contest has been made known over
the campus and the method of l'otr
ing will be as follows; with each livc
dollar payment for the annual there
will be guen live mites and the Burns
bcr given to those who make part
lliuulellt will bc in accordance to the
amount paid. For instance, if a Dd)”
ment of $200 is made tliei'e\l\'ill be
allowed two votes or if three dollars
is payed there will be given three
votes. The voting will be done dur-
ing the heck of the campaign andno
votcs made at the second payment for
the annual.

Full Page I-'or lliiiiiei-s

There will be twelve girls homin-
ated by the student body instead oi
ten as stated iii the former announce-
ment, and tho photos will be sent to
the judge, Richard Bartlielmess, ior
final choice. Each of ilic live Winr
lners will receive a full page in the
hcaiity section of the animal. Tlicrc
u ill be no iii-st or second choice from
Mr. Bartlielmess but inercly live Wins

winners of the contest. Those are
appearing in the various windows
downtown and will be awarded when
the winners are made known. ‘

Tomorrow Is Church
Day Among Students

“Go to Church” is the slogan of the
Y. W. C. A., and the Y. M, C. A. in
their efforts to get a good student
turn out at the various churches to-
marrow.

All of the churches will have spec-
ial programs of some sort, for the 0017
loge students and they invite a large
attendance. The denominations with
churches in Griniiell are: Methodist.
Bath, Congregational, Catholic,
United Presbyterian, Christian aiid
Christian science society.

It is the intention of the “Y's" to
have students in the dormitories and
quadrangle, meet by groups and go to
the churches of their choice.

Deadline for Tanager
Extended to Nov. 8

The deadline for contributlons to
the Tillmcei', the new college literary
magazine, has been extended to 3:30
o'clock Monday, November 8. The
editorial board of the magazine found
‘thal there was Sufficient material but
not all of it was of a quality that met
the high standard which the board
has set.

The delay is expected to mean a
better Tanager but it will also mean
that the magazine will not be pubr
llshefl until after Thanksgiving vitcn»

Coach “Mike" Hyland left for Ames
this morning with his entire squad,
prepared to do battle thls afternoon
with Iowa state, in the yearly strug-
gle with the pigskin. The freshmen
football squad and a large number of
the student llady accompanied the
varsity on the special train.

With interest running high and
"Boat Grinnell” as their watch word.
the Cyclone coaches and fans have
bent every effort the pastsweek to see
that the Crinnell team comes home
deieated this afternoon. The conflict
today between the old rivals will
serve as the chief attraction for the
annual Ames homecoming, and the
Cyclones were anxious for a victory
over the Pioneers before the old
grads in order to partly avenge the
[defeat handed them last year,

The Ames squad survived the Nis-
souri contest in good shape and has
been working hard all Week in nre<
paration for the game today. The Cy-
clones presented tlieir full strength
in thc lineup and the same team that
hold and outplayed Missouri during
the first hali last week, faced the
Pioneers at the opening whistle. The
line, composed of coe, Kingery,
Galbraith, Thornburg, Thomas, May-
er, and Bond tor-m a powerful fo
ward wall that is capable of putting
up a stubborn defense. These men
are all veterans and the Pioneer
linesmcn were expected to have their
hands fall this afternoon,

beliius Lend Attack

The backfield was headed by the
crafty Johnny Behm and his hard
hitting- brother Norton. besides these
two flashy backs, the Cyclones al-
u'ilys depend on Cory and Hall to
come through for some long gains.
Cory is especially good at cracking
the line and has starred in every
game this season. Last Saturday he
lacked seven yards of making
much yardage from Scrimmage as
the entire Missouri team, This Der-

Iorulzmce alone marks him as a. dang—
erous inaii. '-

Thc Cyclones greatly respect the
ability oi the Pioneers due to their
showing against Drake and the Okla—
honia Aggies and there is no ‘feeling
of over confidence among Coach Wil-
liinairs squad.

Pioiicers in Good Shape

The Grinnell team is also in excel-
lent physical condition for the battle
today. The men came out of the
game last Saturday with no serious
iiiju ‘es and almost the entire squad
was in shape to enter the fray. The
Pioneers hit their stride last Satur-
day by walloping Oklahoma A. and ML
and this victoiy has inspired a feeling
of coiilidencc in the Scarlet and Black
camp that will make them hard to
beat

the most feared men on the Pioneer
