PICTURE COMING
WEEK.

”North 0! 35,” by Emerson Hough.
depicting all the thrills and hardships
,ot pioneer days on the Texas cattle
lranges, has been ﬁlmed ror Paramount
by Irvin Willat, who made the natural-
color picture ‘Wanderer oi the Waste-
land” and other classics.

"North or 36" is a tale of the Texas
cattle trail, picturing s country wild,
almost lawless, at the period of the
story, roughened and disheartened by
the’ great Civil War.

Lois Wilson, as Taisie Lockhart.
manager of her own vast ranch in
Texas, ﬁnds herseht penniless, with
no means of disposing of her herds,
her chiet asset being the true spirit
0: the pioneers.

Word comes that way- up

GREAT .XT

 

"north

of 36," a market beckons. with her
4,500 cows, 1o cow hands, 19 kinds ot
riiles and six shooters and 115 cow
ponies, Taisie makes the start with
all the thrills that the start or the
wagon train in Emerson I-Iough's ”The
Covered Wagon" evolved.

Through this great panorama one
sees groups or ragged sinewy men, the
glorious girl at their head, the oxearts
and the sea or long horned cattle, ace
complishiug one at the greatest deeds
or pioneer hravery and daring.

Paramount has iurnished a notable
cast to visualize the story. It in»
cludes Jack Holt, Ernest Terrence,
Lois Wilson and Noah Beer-y in reat-
ured roles. The picture opens a three
days‘ run next week at the Colonial
theatre. It's a eoloriul page train
the history of the United SMtes—h
second “Covered Wagon!"
