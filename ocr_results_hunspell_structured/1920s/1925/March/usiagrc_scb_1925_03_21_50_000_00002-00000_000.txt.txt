time for some searching questions on'
the matter of our so-cailed "student

Someone recently remarked, “We’ll
have student government just as long
as student opinion coincides with the
opinion or the powers that be, and

it doesn't, we'll find
that no more,

This is not an imputation against
faculty government. Most schools
have it, and perhaps it's the best kind
of government ior us. But if

ourselves by thinking we have student

But we should not delirde ourselves
by trusting to a more negative l:init-
ng of armaments to solve the prob-
lem of world peace. it can be solved
only by setting up in an attirmotive
way some method of adjusting inter—
national disputes other than hy 'resort
to arms. The question is not whether
or not nations are lairly armed. The
question is how a nation can maintain
its rights without being armed.

We shall decieve ourselves it we

The Changing Times.

‘c ticisin the Men's Government has
‘l’eceil'cd. It has been interesting to
determine the reasons for this differ-
ence.

‘ A question of Eilllllﬂlle'ide interest
for some time “as selected, the {zl-
uli r question of Sunday (lilies. As
many lillow, (his question \VIIS voted
'on last Spring. However, c cisin
hits frequently been made as to the
vote on and nretlrods or presenting
such questions. The Sunday date
voting of last year has been criticised
by the women and by the men . As
result the Men’s Senate last fall ad-
dressed a letter to the LEnguC Board,
requesting that a tree. unqualified
vote on the question oi Sunday dates
be held in the A, R. H. conducted by
disinterested parties, men‘s and wom-
en's votes counting equally. It was
further understood that no propa-
ganda. oi any kind was to be used.

In reply the League Board referred
to the vote of last Spring giving de«
tails as to how the vote was done. but
gnoring about belt of the request.

The Men's Senate dropped the mat-
ter, feeling that little could be done
without cooperation,

Two members of the Senate and
Student Council, in on error: to de
terinine the true facts of the situation,
recently held a ballot on the ques—
(ion of Sunday dates. This question
was understood tn mean Sunday dates
for the Whole year in addition to our
present. regulations. The vote was
held at this time because it was be.
lieved that the true state ot opinion
might be better estimated,~fil'5t, lie-
‘Cﬂllse Sunday dates will be a reality

Jacob Could Schurinan has bccir
promoted to the ambassador-ship \0
Germany to succeed A. B, ilouglrton,
who goes to the Court or st. James.

happy one, in the best traditions of
‘Alrrerican rliplomacy He is the secs
ond president at Cornell university to
be appointed minister to Germany, the
other hciiig Andrew D. White, probe
ably the most successrul German aw:

raphy is one of the great American
boobs, quite equal to Paige's “Lets

in'tavor. Such a high proportion or
moll' votes was obtained that' the
majority among the men need not be‘
oucstioned,

The his point to be _
s that the lion‘s Government has
readily rellected the opinion or the:
rneir wheir it unanimously voted in id;
\or or Sunday dates. It has shown’
itselr to be true student govern-l
merit by its open reilectiou at the
men's opinion, and by its desire to ac-
curately obtain opinions, Tlle League
Board has not restlcted readily to pllbr‘
lic opinion. This has not been due,
to any desire at the League Board to‘
curb public thought, but rather duel
to an irri-eheiit detect iir its organizi-
tion,

The Leacue Board should be replace,

rcsentative body would make all rules
and laws. It would settle the lawn-L
ouarl aue. ion. It would be more"
representative, of classes, cottages;
groups and bring the general backing
of the school behind every rule and
regulation better than the present
system, \

A body similar to the Cour-t would,
carry out the laws or the tirst group.[
This group would be composed or five'
Seniors and two Juniors, the two Jun-
iors holding over into their Senior-
year. Every year. then it would be
necessary to elect fire to the Court
body and ten to the Senate body in an
open ballot. l
‘ in voting, one good system is to
have open nomination and preliminary
vote. The 10 highest be selected tor
the final ballot to rthe Court, and the
20 highest in the preliminary vote tor
the Senate be elected for the final bal-
-lot.
