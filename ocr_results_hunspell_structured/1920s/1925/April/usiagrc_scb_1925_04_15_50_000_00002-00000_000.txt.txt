We may divide the college student
body into three general groups, ac-

track meet that occurred last Satur-
day on Word Field. First there

The success of the home meet last
Saturday was certainly promising. It
was not due to tradition that seven
records were broken. The hard earned
records of past stars were not easily
bettered. The reason for it all is
that the track squad each year goes
out with the spirit and determination
to will, and they do will. This year
the spirit is being manifested early
in the season, and everything points to
