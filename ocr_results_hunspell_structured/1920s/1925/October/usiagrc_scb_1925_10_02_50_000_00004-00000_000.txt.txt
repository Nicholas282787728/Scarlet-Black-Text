The football season gets iully under
way today with every school in the
Missouri valley meeting a strong op-
ponent.

Three intrarconfereuce games wcrc

played and the other valley schools
went into action against some strong
rivali Although several games were
played last week, most of them
were in the nature of practice con-
tests that could not give a real test
of Lhe team's strength as today’s scores
can. . .
Volley schools which will break
into the percentage columns are Kilns
sas U. and the Oklahoma Aggies, the
latter playing her ﬁrst game as a
conference member; Oklahoma U. and
the Kansas Aggies will both he tested
in their game at Manhattan. St. Louis
will entertain the other conference
combat between Drake and Washing
too.

The outcome of the game will he in-
teresting in that Washington iootball
is reported to be on the upgrade while
Drake is thought to be weaker than
last year due to the loss o: stars by
graduation and elimhility rules.

Missouri vs. Tulane at New Orleans
is one of the largest intersectionnl con—
tests of the day but for this section
of the country it does not rival in in-
terest the game between Nebraska and
Illinois, The contest will bring to—
gether two alermel‘iczln stars of last
year. Ed Weir of the Huskers, and
“Red" Grango‘of the mini.
