When the Drake and Grinnell foot-
ball teams line up for the opening
kickoff Saturday afternoon, in their
thirty-second annual feud, the Pin.
neers will face a maddened Bulldog.
Stung by defeat at the hands of Oklhr
homa last week whom they were
doped to win the Blue and limite
gridders are determined to redeem,
themselves.

The Bulldogs are not only anxious
to chalk up another conference vic~
tory but trimming Crinnell hleanSra
great deal to Salem’s men, at all the
games Drake desires to win, it is the
one with the Pioneers, and the Blue
and White eleven always rises to su-
preme heights on this occasion.

Feeling sure of an easy victory
Drake journeyed to Oklahoma only to
be turned back by the Sooners. There
is no feeling of over-confidence this
week in the Bulldog camp. and ins
stead there is a grim look of deter»
minau'on on the face of every memr
ber of the Drake squad. Coach Salem
realizes the strength of the Pioneer
team and knows that Drake will have
to play smart football to win.

, Drake started the season by defeat—
ing Washington a to o and then drub—
bing the strong Knnsas Aggie team
19 to 0. The results of these games
show the power of the Bulldogs and
that they are capable of playing
championship football.

in all probability Drakc will he
able to place their strongest lineup in
the field next Satur Headed by
Captain Don Carlos, the Blue and
“mites slashing center, the Bulldogs
will be in excellent condition for the
battle. Don Carlos has been playing
a hang up game this year, starring in
every contest. in the Kansas Aggie
game he opened huge holes for the
Drake backs to plow through and
much credit for Drake’s victory was
due to him. “Chuck” Everett,.nrake's
flashy back and a star of last year’s
team who has been out most of the
season with injuries, is rounding into
shape and will be ready to play Sat—
urday. He will undoubtedly cause the
Pioneers plenty of trouble.

Besides Everett in the backfield,
Drake has Sutherland, Fry, Cook,
Spears, Cronkhite and Dustin. All
these men have toted the bztll well so
far this season and are consistent
ground gainers. Cook and Spears are
especimly dangerous men, both being
clever open field runners and good
line smashers.

The Drake line from tackle to tank-
le is practically the some as last
years. Their forwards are heavy
and fast and charge well. They coma
pletely outplayed the much touted
Aggie line. The end positions are
held down by Sampel, a fine punter,
and the redoubtable Ted Sloan. Little
need be said of Sloan’s work for he
is one of the best ends in the Valley.
Sampel, though only a sophomore,
has been playing good football and
has won a permanent position on the
team. His punts averaged thirty
five yards in the Oklahoma game.

With a heavy forward wall and a
last backfield, Drake will present a
formidable team that will furnish the
Pioneers stiff opposition, The con-
test Saturday ought to be one of the
hardest fought battles that has eyel-
taken plane between the two aucicnt
rivals.

The team has shown up well in the
three games that have been played
but the Drake game will test the «Mir

spectacular bit of play this season
has been Moran's 30 yard return of
