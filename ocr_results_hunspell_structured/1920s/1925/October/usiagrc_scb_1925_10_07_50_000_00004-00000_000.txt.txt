The Missouri lllC_ football ‘lletl-i
ule was opened l-st Saturday witli‘
three conference _ mes and four none
conference tilts. in the lattei, Valley;
teams scored one victory. tire ties‘
and one defeat.

Nebraska turned in the sin-p ‘ or
the day by Stopping "Red" Grange,
and his lllini cohorts to the tune of
14 10 o. Capt. Ed Weir, Lllc Valley's
ﬁll»:\lilerlcan star, played the leading,
role with his marvelous defense \VOl'lK.’

Missouri met two adversaries, 'l‘w!
lane university and some e. reme
heat which slowed them down, Coach
Henry's outfit enjoyed a ii to 0 lead,
until the weather began to tell, and
only then did the Southerners tie it
up at t; . .

Alnes was the victim of a heavier
outfit, and bowed to Wisconsin for a
30 to a defeat. The great reserve'
strength of the Badgers was too much
for the lownus and they could not‘
repel the advances of the fast moving
Wisconsin team.

Grinnell met a worthy opponent in
Cornell and the best they could do
on the muddy field was to tum in a.
3 to 3 tie. Defensive work or both
teams prevented a larger score, so
the two ﬁeld goals constituted the [eel
tal points. _

In. conference games Kansas' vic—‘
tory over the Oklahoma A and hi:
showed great defensive strength for
the layhawks. The new member of
the conference held the Kansans to'
a 13-3 score, however, and showed
themselves to be of true Missouri
Valley caliber,

Drake plowed through mud to beat
the Washington Pikers 64). Neitheri
outfit was able to display their
strength, so that both are yet an im-
iinown quantity.

The Kansas Ageies worked Okla-
homa U. for a 164) victory and there-
by establisiied themselves as danger-
ous contenders for conference honors.

The game Saturday was closer than
the score would indicate, and it was

a few breaks plus the brilliant work (From. hm it is understand m

of Haslgard, Aggie back, tlltll. decided

A real treat is in store for the rnot-
bail fails when Ossic Soiem brings
his Drake Bulldogs to Ward field
to battle the Fiona. s on October 24
it is Homecoming I ~ Grilluell. and
the Pioneers will he luxious to avenge
some of the del'cats handed them by
the solemites before the old grails,

l‘i-rse son dope shows that the
Bulldog will not be as powerful as
last 135011, The loss of such stars
as Oi-ebaueh, Lineenlelter, Enright,
and Spears cut heavily into the Blue
and White's ranks and these men \ ‘ll
be hard to replace. Nevertheless
Drake always s to supreme
heights on this occasion, l“ crett,
Drake's flashy quarter bac will be
in the lineup and will give the Pin-
iieers plenty of trouble. He will have
to be closely watched.

This year appears to he Grinnell's
best chance to dull.) the Bulldogs and
,Coach Hylnnd will not uverlook any
details in preparing the team for the
‘ game. An open date before the Drake
game will give the Pioneers suffic-
ient time to tune up for their Des
Monies rivals,

Besides the bright prospects 01' LlC-
featiug Drake are the annual Home.
;coniim activities. The 1925 Home~
coining ought to far surpass any of
the past.
