A NEW TRADITION
A week l'roiu today it is [he inteir
tion or the student body to start a
new tradition; that of holding an an-

nual allrcollege celebration.

The idea o 'ginated iii the men's
senate and it was the intent to cap—
italize the nickname Pioneers; which
we Enjoy using. It was thought that
since Grinnell prides herseli upon be—
ing a “sodrbl‘eaker’k it was iitting
that she should make the [itct known
by a yenrly jubilee or special day or
some sort.

It is a very creditable undertaking,
and although it adds to our already
heavily loaded calendar, it no doubt
can be made into an event of which

enough to. impress everyone with the
fact that Gi-iiuiell was the rirst col-
lege to invade the western prairies.

Unless that is done the whole “fail"

is liable to stray from its purpose and
degenerate into a cheap and meaning-
less attempt to have a good time.

The big event has not yet been
named so why not give it the simplest
name possible
day? It tells the entire story and it is

easy to say.

CRAIW'DED FIELDS
Down in Bolivia the teaching
law has been tempura 'ly discontinu-

propriations that this was done but .m
the fact that the profession had be

In this country where we love to
quote,"‘thel‘e is plenty or room at the
top," this action seems veiy queer.
However, when We luck about and see
the many proiessioiial men who are
mediocre and barely sell supporting,
