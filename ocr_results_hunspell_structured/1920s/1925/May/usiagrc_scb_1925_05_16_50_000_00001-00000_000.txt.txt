OUTCOME CANNOT BE ISOPED

(irillrltcll nrrd lowrr liliuk i-(lilnrlst (in
Pnpor lint Amos and Drake 3. ,
Flglu'e'lu Scoring.

A galaxy oi stars will demonstrate
their prowess on Ward Field next Sat-
urday when the sir foremost schools
in the state engage in the annual con—
test for state supremacy. Tile schools
uorve entered in the meet are Allies,
Iowa, Drake, Coo, Cornell and Grilr
hell.

The day should see the breaking of
several records and the time in all
the events will be equal to that of oth—
er meets, Never before has this state
seen its records upheld and broken by
men who so consistarltly are proving
that low is inferior to no one in its
cinder stars. The ruins this week
will put the track in excellent con-
dition and it the day is iair, fans are
assured a good array of events from
the high hurdles to the broad jump.

Forecasting on the outcome is on-
certain, The results of this week’s
nreets will give a fairly accurate lille
on the strength of the different
teams, however. As it stands now it
is between Iowa and Grinnoll but any
of the other sciloois may provide an
upset,

Today Jowa duals with Minnesota,
Drake with Crioghton and Ames and
Grinnell engage in battle. Whether-
the Hawkeyes, Bulldogs, Cyclones or
Pioneelsavin. it will give a closeup
view ot the respecting strength of the
teams and a comparison of times will
serve as accurate dope on the State
meet.

Grinhell is well represented in tile
hurdles with Taylor, Olympic chums
pion, and Green as probable leaders,
and new records shorrld result.
sonar-nrvcber and L. Jones rate with
others in the state as sprinters and
Kitchen is a fast quarter miler. Rine-
tort and :rleeter rvill be the Pioneer
big bets in the field events alld Taylor
will also probably enter botil Jumps.

lowa sends the largest entrance list
and among them are several notables
in the track and field cvonts. Phelps
was a member of the Olympic team,
is the western two mile champion and
record holder or the confer-once indoor
two mile record. He also [link his
event in the Penn relay . Captain
Chan Coulter of the rlllirer ity aggre-
gation was also an Olympic man and
quarter mile conference champion in

1924. He won this event in the state
meet last year. Jones has been
br-oadjumping around 23 feet consist-
ently and has placed ill several big
meets this year while his teammate
Dabber is credited with heaving the
shot over do feet which would break
the present record several feet andr
probably win the event. Marshall and‘
Hancock are also probablepoiut game
erers for lowa in the javelin and dis
cus, and Kleudt is high jumping con-
sistently over six tect.

Ames has quite a list oi iavorites
among the fol-most being Conger, who
although in his first year of Camper
tition, is likely to win the mile and
put up a stiff battle for the half.
Sheppard is another capable half mile
or from the Aggie school,

Orehaugh leads the Bulldog list as
a broad and high jumper or merit as
well as a high hurdler. Dalby, his
team mate is one of the loading polc
vaulters in the state and Lillgentelter
heaves the javelin a considerable dis»
tance, Robertson is a possible point
winner in the shot arid Wright steps
the half in good time.

,Cornell's main entrant appeals to
be Miller in the pole vault but she is
credited with strong mile and two
mile relay teams.

Loftus of one is an old Cedar Rap-
ids star and is capable oi stepping the
lit) in around fifty ilat, and with Ulll—
cspie in the discus will probably be
the main point gotters for thc Coe
team.

Miss Sarah Indess MacDonald gave
two piano solos at chapel Thursday
morning. They were "Slow Move—

At the third Senior chltpcl, Pl’olcgsoi'
1'1. \V. Norris Chose the Subject. “The
Obligations of Pelsonalit)" L0 con»
clude A series of chapel Lalks he has
given previously. He emphasized the
fact that, the enrichment of “[9 should
he the obligation and aim of every per»
sollality. and not by heaping but by
giving can this be ilccnmplishetl. The
obligation and right of every animal
is to get anything and everything out
OK everything. “A LhSDltIy Of the Sur-
vival of the ﬁttest,7sucll is it world
without personality." But1et persom
dllty appear, and everything is
changed. Personality involves the
recognition of individual rights and the
Value of life. The law of animals is
everything for sell, but when person-
ality ls llllo“ ed to enter in, individual
“$th are respected, and there is an

, avowed recognition of the obligation or

he sollnlity to enrich life.

.lilu ll: Certain biological i'euutl'er
meuls but he dilfel‘s ll‘olll animals in
that he has the capacity tor the cllr h»
llleut ol life. A poet who contributes
a poclll for the enjoyment oi the rest
oi the world is enriching l‘iic. Heather
yen :lnd Mozart who have contributed
beautiful music to the world, he who
constructs a highway to sonic beauty
spot ill nature, he who sets aside a bit
of nature as a public park, he who
torlllds a library, he who givcs his lil'c
to teaching or preaching,—rtll ot these
are enriching life to the fullest extent.

Destructive competition of man is
one of the gl-cotcst obstacles to the rule
ﬁllnlent oi this purpose. “blah ought
to abolish w Tare or all kinds.” It is
suicide, and any attempt to justify it
is a revert to 'o. type or r'nlpersollality.
Man has not realized his inherent ca-
pacitles, and perhaps a full realization
of them is not to he desired, hilt the
present obligation of personality lies
in the necessisty (if enriching life.

view tradition and enters upon a now
held ol drolnatics.

Tile ievlte is rr series oi acts and
Enlr rftcts which lorma balanced and
varied program.

”The Garden oi Kama." is a Hindu
tale, dramatized from tllc famous
Kashmir-i love songs oi Laurence
Hope, set to music by Amy Woodford
Findcll. it is the story oi the love oi
all irrdian prince for a. dancing-girl.
A striking set in black and gold, with
special lighting, adds to the interest
of the scene. Arthur Faguyvcote and
Ethel Van Fossen. will sing the lead-
illg roles. ‘

A Chalii arrangement for Gr-ieg's
“Tu Spring” will be danced by twelve
girls in Greek costume. M. Chaliﬂs
arrangements are always interesting
and “To Spring" is said to be one or
his best.

A campus scene, "Ain’t Love Wow
del'iul” will be presented by a student
cast. This scene is a spicy shit, por—
traying a determined pair of lovers
who let nothing stand in their path.

“The Mikadu's Garden" is a burles—
que opera based on several well-
kllown operas. The principal roles
will be sung by a strrdent-iaculty cast,
who will be assisted by a large chor-
ris, arid the college orchestra. The
Chinese setting for this scene is par—
ticularly striking in its blue, scarlet,
gold, and green color scheme

All rrltra-cxpressionistic set in the
Rus all manner will be used for "The
Joyride," all irrestibly funny episode
from the Americdll‘s favorite in-or—
orrtdoor sport.

“Balloons" is a novel ellti'eVacle in
which eight tiny girls are featured.

“The Temple oi ls , which Coir
chides tile program, is an Egyptian
dance drama in three espisodos, the
legend oi an Egyptian goddess. A
superb set and fine costurning, as
well as notable dancing, will feature
the scene. .

Late changes ill the original cast,
announced last week, are: Katherine
Davis as the Gypsy Dancer ill “The
)lilindo’s Garden" and John M. Smith
ill “Balloons,"

Such a widely varied program de-
mands and gives opportunities ior_the
finest oi staging and direction. New
properties, such as the Cir-e drop, only
one of which can be loulld in Des
Monies theatres. and several sets the»
signed and built by members of the
Experimental Theatre, have been add—
ed to stage equipment especially for
this production,

The rcvrlc is strictly a Grinnell pro»
duction, Sets, costumes, ’and proper—
ties have been designed and executed
on the campus by members of faculty
and stridcilt body. The shits are the
product or local talent and many of
the dances are the worlr at Miss And-
erscn. Musical ‘settings are direct-
ed by George L, Pierce.

The complicated process of produc.
tion,, that srrcli widly differ-cutiatel
acts demand, has been carried out in
a truly professional manner at the
workshop in Rand gymnasium. "All
thc cificiency oi a professional staff
combined with all the zest of the ama-
tcrlr producer," is the description giv—
en lry all interested spectator.

The ncvnc this year tnlrcs the place
