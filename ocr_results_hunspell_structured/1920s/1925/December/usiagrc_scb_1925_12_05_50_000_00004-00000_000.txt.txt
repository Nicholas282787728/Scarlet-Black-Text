“'ullnoc Best Pivot

Wallace, Oklahoma's crack center
is the pick of the pivot men. He com-
bines all the qualities that go to make
up a good center. He passes well at
all times which gives him a decided
advantage over the other centers. He
possesses a keen ability to size up the
opponents play, backs up the line well
on defense and is an accurate tackler.

The quartet of hacks selected pro-
vide this mythical eleven with one of
the best backiields in many years.
Jackson of Missouri is a hefty hack
and a star ball lirgger. He is a smart
player, a good field general. and a
shitty, elusive, hard hitting back.
‘ Rhode and Cochrene are halfbacks
of rare duality. The Husker star is
a powerful driver and a speedy end
runner. He runs excellent interfer-
ence ior his teammates and hacks up
the line in good shape on defense. For
three years he has been a mainstayof
the Nebraska backfield.

‘Cocllmlle Pick of Quamrs

Cochrane played quarter this sea-
son and is one of the most capable
signal callers in the conference. How~
ever he would easily fit in as a half-
back as he is a clever open field rune
her. a good passer, and one of the
best punters ever seen in Missouri
Valley circles.

Ripping the Missouri line to pieces'

is one of the accomplishments of
Cory. Amos backfield star. Thoirgh
only a sophomore be easily outshines
other valley fullhaoks. Tipping the
scales at 190 he become a human
tractor on the gridiron and is seldom
stopped without a gain. He is a
power on the defense as well as of-
fense.

If this team were actually to es-
semhle they would represent an al-
most perfect machine, The line would
be heavy and fast and flanked by two
dependable w-ingmen. The for-wards
would he able to open large holes for
the backs to tear- through and their
power on detense would he unquest-
ionable. The backfield could employ
a running attack, smashing attack, or
gain yardage by the aerial route. The
kicking could be done .by Weir or
Cochrane with equally good results.
