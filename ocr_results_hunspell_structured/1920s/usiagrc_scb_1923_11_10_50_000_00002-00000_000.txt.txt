“A PART OF THE INSTITUYI‘ION".

“Adams College..— ‘The Pioneer Cil-
lege oi the Pl'airles'. is the opening
phrase or a certain short story. “A
Part ol the Institution," appearing in
the October “Smart Set ., The col-
lege is described as having bccn
‘taunded by a band of New England
Missionarics, "in the interests or
Christanity and a higher learning in
the West"

r lege" hut Grinnell College.

The story is though—provoking in
that the writer has presented a true
geographical and eitcrnal picture or

sugarvcoaled, “goody-goody," senti—
ments concerning morals and ideals.
Miss Suckow becomes almost cynical
in her description or the ideal girl of
the "Adams type" who is, "sweet and
loyal," active in the Y. w. c. A, de~
voted entirely to the ”spirit at scr,
vice, of democracy and the Adams
ideals” and interested only in the "real‘
things that the College stood for."

Simplicity — sometimes demure, sometimes sophis-

the fashion trend of the newest garment styles, both
in their smart lines, and in their subdued oulorings.
Particular women will appreciate the fashion under-
standing evidenced by these November displays, for
