America hits not been accustomed to seeing women
smoke that her people were so shocked at first. Pro-
test was general. but not especially severe and women
seemed to say. “for centuries we have been bound byl
foolish taboos. but now that we have proved ourselves
equal to men. we shall live and enjoy life as they do.
It men can smoke. we can smoke." and as a result, wom-
en are' smoking. ‘

"A woman's cigarets are her own business." men are
saying. ”If she wants to smoke it is no affair of mine.
She is harming only herself. I don't have to go with
a girl who smokes if I do not like the habit." Men are

. WOMEN AND CIGARETS.

Only recently America was aroused to the fact that
cigaret smoking among women was not going to exist
without open opposition. Because Agnes Maude Roydeu.
English woman minister. smokes cigorets she was com
sidered unfit to speak to the people of Boston. The
Missionary societies of Boston protested to such an exs
tent that Miss Royden did not lecture there. Not only
was opposition felt in the East but the W. c. T. u. and
the Parent Teachers association tried to persuade oftic»
ials of the University of Iowa that Miss Royden would be
a menace to the students. In the days before prohibition
the people allowed James Whitcomb Riley to read his
poems from the platform. if he was sober enough to
stand. and the audience enjoyed Riley’s verse. What
point is there in depriving the people of America the
opportunity of hearing a well known English woman

‘ minister. because she smokes cigarets?

Eighty years ago England was greatly disturbed over
the fact that women threatened to fall into the masculine
habit of smoking. However. England’s dismay did not
last long; the women seemed to realize that it was not
the best thing for themselves or for society in general,
and abandoned the use of tobacco.

Today women are again hastily and thoughtlessly.
perhaps, falling into the habit of smoking. It is not an
entirely new custom. Russian and Austrian women have
smoked for many years and (he morals of those coun-

Wednesday, Jnnuun‘ 11. 1928.

Before condemning the custom. it is only fair that
consideration be given to the question whether or no,
cigaret smoking is harmful to the individual. “0 I never
inhale." No, probably not. but the chances are. that as
the rcspiraiory system becomes accustomed to the con-
tinual use of tobacco. inhaling gradually becomes invol—
untary. The man who is training for an athletic contest
knows absolutely that smoking destroys his endurance
and deprives him of the iinnl drive that is needed for
the winning spurt at the finish. Why is it the human
race is content to live in a condition at only partial
physical ﬁtness? The habit is also condemned as being
expensive. and there is no doubt but that this is true.
As for being dirty. which is correct. it stains the fingers
and the teeth. and gives the breath an unpleasant odor.
It weakens character This is certainly true when in.
dulged in by growing children, but when applied to
grown men and women we can not definitely say. The
“Hygeia” edited by the American Medical Association
published this statement recently: "Professor Schumpf-
Pierron is convinced that continued studies are necessary
to find out exactly what the effects of tobacco on the
human body may be. The general conclusion is that
excessive smoking of tobacco is harmful. but tobacco
taken in moderation by a healthy person does not pro-
duce any symptoms or any changes of importance." Ah
so it was mentioned in this same article that a moderate
dosage harmless to a healthy person would be Serious
to one physically weak. However. there is always the im-
portant prevailing danger or intemperance. and it will
be found on close observation that where smoking is in—
dulged in at all, the majority smoke to the point of in»
temperance.

Smoking among women has evidently come to stay for
a time. The modern women and college girl is smoking
pre-erninently because it is the fashion and as long as
it is the prevailing custom among those of her sex. she
will continue to do so. It is partly up to the men wheth-
er or no this custom becomes pcrmenant. If the men
cares not if his wife, or the girl he expects to marry
smokes, then the practice will endure until hc is cone
viuced that it is detrimental to his home. and rebels. We
doubt ll cigarct smoking among women will remain for-
ever. but it will exist. at least. until there is a complete
revolution ct social and moral standards of the American
people.
