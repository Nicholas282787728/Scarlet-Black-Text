~ “DOWN WITH CHICAGO!”

Suppose Mayor w. G. Ray of Grlunell should delegatd
Chief of Police Manson to make a raid upon the Grinnell
college library with the intention of taking out gill books
which Mayor Ray decided were pro-Chicagoan in nature
and to burn them on the shore of Arbor Lake. Suppose
that Mayor Ray would then claim that by doing this he

«Was promoting a Gl‘lnnell-First program, and that too
many books in this town were inking El villainous stand
Iavoring Chicago as against the City of Grinuell.

Laughingly absurd as this sounds, it ls exactly What
has happened in Chicago. ilaycr William Hale Thomp-
son, “Big Bill” as the boisterous supporters 01 his
avowedly wet platform call him, thinks that the books
in the Chicago libranv contain "vicious pro-British" duc—
trines and has appointed lormer Congressman John .7.
Gnrman and U. J. (Sport) Hei'rman to investigate and
segregate all such books. Mayor Thompson has lately
denied having anything to do with the Widely circulated
report that he had authorized Sport Herrman to burn

f the books on the Lake front but somehow this is just What
one should expect or Chicago’s ward-politican mayor.

Thompson based his campaign for office on the fact
that he is for America. against all other nations, that he
is against anything savoring of a world court or league
of nations and that he is as Wet as any one could Well be.
It naturally follows that this one hundred per cent Amer-

ican should also show gross ignorance in other matters.
So many ridiculous statements about American history
have been made by the “King Gccrge haters" and so
many prejudiced actions have been taken by tilenl that
it would take reams to print them all and would in ad-
ditloll turn this account into a farce. _
But although Mayor Thompson has again made Chi-
ccgo the laughing stock of tho United States, there is an
/2\lal‘luingly serious side to tho Altair. nritlsll citicials
ill the country have undoubtedly not taken great delight
ill the anti-Bl-ltlsll proceedings and perhaps lrreparable
injury to the common friendship between the two nations
may result. Hlstol-y books will continue to be written
with their guiding principle to find the truth no matter
how unpleasant it may be. When Chicago‘s Mussolini
gets through excluding all pro-British books what is to
stop him from burning the ill-orFl-ench, prerGol-man, pro-
Italiun, prornunssian books?

JUST ONE BIG FADEILY.

The, cit-sounded slogan that G 'unell college is "just

one big family” is too platonically ideal to lit this 'll-ldi
ualistic community, There are too many iactions, too
many organizations, too many people with one linger

plucked out at the pie to make such an assertion bullet—
