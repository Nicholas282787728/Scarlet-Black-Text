NISEDHY DNEH AMES
ENDS DEBATE SEASDN

Local Teams Have Experienced
All Unusually Successful
Series of Debates,

By winning a 47 to 35 decision of
the audience in their debate at Allies
Monday evening, James Work Herald
Hicks, and John McGee brought to its
close a successful season in Grllmell
forensics. The World court question
was discussed.

The Allies negative team, composed
of Mitchell Spl'ole, James K. Miles,
and Harry L, Daasch, presented one
of the strongest cases wsich the lo
cal arguers have met this season. By
basing their objections to the entrance
of the United states into the World
court on the fault of treaties upheld
by the 'court, the Andes trio presented
an attack which the local team men
with difficulty.

kn refuting the negative attack,
considerable extemporaneous work
was demanded of tss Grinnell been.
They were able to win, simply by con»
sistently maintaining that the court is
the most practical plan yet devised
for the settlement of international
disputes.

Forum Lively

In many respects ‘this debate was
one of the best and most interesting
of the season. During the open forum
which followed the contest the audi—
encc received with appreciation l'ee
marks by an English student at Ames,
who pointed out in an amusing and
convincing manner the necessity for
America's cntracc into the World
court.

in review, this season in Grinnell
forensics rates quite satisfactorily. in
each of the decision debates, one with
Beloit and two with Am’es, local teams
havo cmer‘gcd victorious- and in non-

iun contests held with Knox and
the State university, the Grinch in»
guers have given good account of
themselves. in argument the locals
have held their own against other-
teams, and in delivery and stage pres-
ence they have\ consistently out»point—
ed their opponents. ‘

Each of this year's contests has
been followed by an openvforum dis-
cussion which feature has been ap-
preciated by the audiences and de-
bators alike. In the three decision
contesm, the audience decision was
used. .

This type of decision was an lnno~
vation in Gl'innell forensics, but has
provcu its worth as an effective meter
of the ccmmunicativcness of the
speakers, and as an indicator of the
trend in bublic opinion.

DDDNDIL lD NDTE DN
DYDLDNE PLAN lDDAY

Discussion in Glass Meetings Is
Generally Favorable to
New Proposals.

The plan for the reorganization of
tho Cyclone as proposed by the Stu—
dent council was presented to the
Freshman and Sophomore classes in
open meetings held Monday and Tues-
day evenlngs. Considerable discus-
sion from each of the classes seemed
to indicate a concensus of opinion in
favor of the general form of Lhe plan.
A few minor changes were proposed
in various forms and will be reported
to the student council for considerat—
ion.

The final consideration and vote on
the plan will take place at the special
meeting of the Student council to bc
held at 9 p. in. today.

Features of the proposed plan are,
the placing of the Board election on
a merit basis very slmllar to that
now used by the Scarlet and Black.
the election of sophomore members to
the Board to give more experience to
at least a few students before actualle
ly becoming members of the staff, and
the featuring of seniors instead of
juniors, a custom which Grlnnoll
stands almost alone in retaining.

The new plan also recommends
that the editor and business manager
of tho Cyclone hold over Ln an advis-
ory capacity' subject to the will of the
new Board. This last suggestion is
made in an attempt to allow the new
Board to profit by the experience of
the past Board and to facilitate the
organization of the new staff in the

Spring.

SDDNSIL ADDPlS PLAN
EDH HE-DHSANIZATIDN

If Faculty Approval Is Gained,
New Constitution Will Be
Put to General Vote.

The Student Council at its meeting
Sunday evening, March 22, unani-
mously approved of a detailed and
definite plan ofre-orgonization pres»
entcd by a comniittce of the Council
that had been working on the question
for several weeks. The Council is pc-
titioning the faculty to approve of the
plan, and if faculty approval is gained,
its adoption will be put to a vote of
the entire student body.

According to members of the caulk
oil, the plan is in the form of a new
constitution that would convert the
present Student council into a Student
Cover-meat Exccotive committee. It is
intended to more nearly realize the
,primary object of the present Council
as stated in its constitution: "The pro.
motion of mutual understanding be-
tween the Women’s Lcaguc and the
Men's Senate.” The only changes cm.
bodied in the new constitution are
those which it was deemed necessary
to suggest in order that closer coeor-
dination between the Women's League
and the Men’s Senate could be at-
tained. ,

Reduce Memwrslu'p

The Executive committee, as out-
licd in its constitution, would consist
of but sixteen members, as opposed to
the thirty members ‘cf the present
lCouncil. Twelve of these will hold
their positions on the Executive com-
mittee by virtue of holding offices or
committee chairmanships in the Sen-
ate or the League. The plan reported
by the coulmitteo originally provided
for but three additional members, the
president and vif‘erpl'esirlonl‘. of the
junior class and the president of the
Sophomore class. 0n the floor of the
Council meeting the proposed consti-
tution was amended to include the
Editor of the Scarlet and Black as a
committee member, completing the to.
tal of sixteen.

The change in name is suggested by
the Student council to indicate that
the proposed organization is not a
third government, but merely a con-
necting and coordinating link be-
tween the Senatc out] the League
designed to harmonize the activities
of the two governments and to handle
problems that affect them in common.

if the plan as proposed by the Stu-
dent councll is approved by tho facul.
ty, the Scarlet and Black will publish
the new constitution in full at least a
week prior to the general vote of the
student body

MEN’S SENATE NﬂlES
BAHS AHEH lllllllll

Add Rules on Recording of Cars,
Places of Parking, and
Conditions of Use.

At a speclal meeting of the Men's
senate Sunday afternoon, it was voted
that men he allowed to have cars at
Grinnell after spring vacation. The
vote was taken after a report of a
committee composed of Warren Mit—
chell, chairman,.Frank Buunell,‘ and
Earl Jacobson, When a petition for
cars was presented two weeks ago,
the committee investigated the situ-
ation in Crinnell, and also in other
colleges. The committee reported fa—
vorably, and the new ruling’js as
follows:

"All men will be allowed to have
cars after spring vacation with the fol-
lowing considerations: 1. All cars must
be recorded with the dean of men. 2.
The use of any car may be taken from
a. man for gross misuse by himself or
another party: or for unsatisfactory.
college work. It is understood that
the Dean of Men and the Men's court
shall determine what is gross misuse
and what is unsatlsfactory college
work." ’

A new rule in regard to tho park-
ing of cars, also, passed. It is run
follows: “Cars shall not be parked on
the campus except the parking space
north of the dormitories." Last year
cars were parked west of the dorms
in between the buildings, but the
superintendent of grounds has had
these spaces seeded down, and is pre»
paring a field north of the dorms for
parking. ‘
