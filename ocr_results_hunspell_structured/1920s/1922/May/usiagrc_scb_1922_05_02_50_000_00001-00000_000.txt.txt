It Is a Country of Mystery and
Even the Descent of the P60-
ple Is In Doubt.

COUNTRY STRIPPED OF
MUCH WEALTH BY AUSTRIA

The Luck of a. Strong Administra.
tive Class in the Country
Is Apparent.

Continuing his series of lectures on
the general theme “The New States of
Central Europe” Prof. Robert H. Lord
took up Roumania in his third chapel'
lecture yesterday. In opening the lee--
turel' characterized Roumania as a
nation of mystery because there is no
state about which one hears more con-
flicting reports and forecasts. The
Roumanisns claim to be Latin people
and descendants of the ancient Rome
ans while the Hungarians say they are
descendants of Italian Gypsies. The
unprediudiced views or historians,
however, are, first that some of the peo—
ple are descendants of a Roman colony .
sent out by Trajan, and second, thati
others are descendants of a settlement

‘ of provincials speaking the Latin
language, who crossed the Danube-
and merged with the people of :Lisl
country at the time of the invasion of'
the Balkans.

According to Professor Lord the
ﬁrst glrmpse of the Roumanians in,
history comes in the 13th century.’
Germans and Hungarians settled in
the fertile valleys of the country be-
coming the nobility and bourgeoisie
while the Roumanians were reducedl
to a state of sermom.‘ In the 13th and:
14th centuries many of the IloumaJ
plans drifted south to the Danube
thus dividing the country into two
principalities. They were later con.
quered by», the Turks and forced to
cede Bessarabia to Russia to pay
Turkish war debts.

In 1861 as a result of the Crimean
war, these two principalities Were}
freed from Turkish rule and became
united. The Roumanians intervened
Lu the Balkan war of 1913 and thus:
gained the enmity of Bulgaria. Dur-'
log the World war the little country‘
was overrun by the Bulgarians and
Austrians, but with the Allies dictating.

lack of a responsible Russian gov-l
ernmcnt. She was allowed to retain
certain Bulgarian territory on the
Black Sea and acquired Transylvania,
which included a Hungarian settle-
ment of one and one halt millions.
These territorial acquisitions ProJ
fessor Lord feels will be a source 0]!
trouble in the future, especially if
Russia gets on her feet again.
Turning to the domestic affairs of
the new state the speaker declared
that her present problem is her dis-
organized economic and political con
ditions. Itoumania has potential re-
sources but the country was stripped
of a great deal of its wealth by Aus-
tria. Since the war agriculture has
fallen back, government interference
has reduced production of petroleum:
consequently exports are few and lm<
ports are limited. 0n the whole she
has made a less serious effort toward
reconstruction than the other new
states. Politically she has gone back-
ward becauso ot the ignorance of the
people and the lack of an adminis—

ernment Socially Roumania shows
little improvement, the country being
ruled by the old conservative oligar-
chy. The country is without schools.

GRIN NELL SPIRIT”

Hamilton's justly famous motto: “To
Hell with the Fublic.” In the senil-
dhrknoss of the Conclave chamber new
low, a single fifteen watt light casts
its flicker-lug, lurid glow upon the
eighteen noble Greeks therein assem-
bled, draped over and upon sugar
sacks, cracker boxes, iloul‘ barrels.
and other sumptuous Pan—Hellenic
furniture. Just beyond the range of
the feeble light, pai after pair of
fiery diamonds, the inquisitive eyes of
long-tailed, turn-footed eavesdropp—
ers, encircle the asemblage.

Then the ceremonies begin. Each
member rises solemnly in turn, kisses
the holy toe of the Illustrious Keeper
of the Cellar Key, places a thumb in
each ear, flaps his fingers four times.
and in sepulchr-al tones repeats the
sacred formula, ‘Ba, Ba, Black Sheep.’
Thel'eupcn the Illustrious Keeper, etc.

“Fellow keepers of the Grinuell spirit,

Think of it brethren, we, upon wboln
