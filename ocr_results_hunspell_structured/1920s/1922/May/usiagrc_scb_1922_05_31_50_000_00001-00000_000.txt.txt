‘Nine Men to Give Original Ora;
I tions in Chapel at 7130.

Nine menivill speak in the Hyde
original oration contest to be held in
1 Her ck chapel tonight at 7:30 o’clock.

Three Men Finish in Same Order The judges of the contest will be J. G.

in Both Dashes—Paulu
Third in Races.

RECORD IN 100 TIED AND
220 RECORD IS SHATTERED

Nebraska, Kansas, Ames, Kansas
Aggies, Missouri Finish in
Order Named. .
It remained for Paulu to pull down
the only points which the Pioneers re-
ceived in the Missouri valley Meet
which was held at Lawrence, Kansas,
on May 26 and 27. Grinnell took four
points with thirds in both the hundred
yard dash and the 22o yard dash.
Drake ﬁnished just behind Grinnell
with three points to he credit. Ne-
braska took high honors wrth Kansas,
Ames, Kansas Aggies, Missouri, Wash-
ington, Grinnell, Drake, Baker, Pitts—
burg Normal, Central Wesleyan, Kan-
sas Wesleyan and Oklahoma ﬁnishing
in the order named.
Three Men “in Both Dashes.
Two of the main ioatures of the
meet were the hundred and 220 yard
dashes in which Smith. of Nebraska,
Irwin of the Kansas Aggies, and Paulo

of Grinnéll ﬁnished in the order named »

in each event. The century flash went
in :09:4 5 which tied the Valley record

and the 220 was stepped in the record—-

breaking time of 21 3-10 which low-
ers the mark of .
of Missouri in 1920.
It is doubtful it better dashes will
be run in the country this year than
were run in these two events in which
Smith, Irwin and Paulo ran so nearly
together that in each case it required
the decision of the judges to settle‘
who was the winner. In the hundred
Paulo was about a root behind Smith, ‘
the winner or the race and would have
received the same time as did the fleet
Nebraskan if he had been timed. The‘
220 was the score story over again“
with Paulu this time only a trifle over'
a foot behind the winner. It is only
once in a lifetime that such races are!
run as were those two mad dashes tor
the tape last Saturday and Paulu
should receive his due share of the
honor which is coming to him for the
spectacular running which he did in
both races. His perlormance in the
hundred was equal to his best record
and in the 220 he probably ran the
fastest race of his whole career.
Records Lou cred.
Rathburn, Antles two miler, lowered

the Valley record of 8:45:3—5, set by

himself last year, to 9. 21—10. The
Cornhnsker half mile relay team low-
ered another record by a second, the
new marl: being 1:28 2-5. Hamilton a!
Missouri ‘broke the only ﬁeld event

record when he hurled the javciiu 173 l

feet 1% inches. Bradley, the Kansas
Jackrofralldrades, was the .individual
point winner of the meet with a total
of 20 points, scoring ﬁrst: in the 120-
yil'd high hurdles, the shot. discus and
broad jump.

400,000 workers Those who have al-
ready been hit by the cut and those
who fear that they may be in the way
of the reduction soon are r ising a
considerable murmur against-it and a
strike may he the result. Those who
have not been afrected yet but who
may be the next. to receive cuts are
the shopmen, clerks, telegraphcrs,
station employees and some smaller
classes. The decision afiecting these
workers will come on July ﬁrst an
