The Scarlet null nlock announces
with pleasure the election or Hugh
Hole and Gilbert Henry to the business
staff,

ELECTIONS

Next Monday the inculty and the
members of the two upper classes
Will cnst votes to decide who are the
two men and two women ‘Vho have
heen oi the greetest service to their
class and to their College, and WllD
have been the most influential
dents, during their cullege course.
The winners will be awarded the stu-
dent Service licdnls, given by the stu-
dent council.

No vote on a matter of tllis kind
should be based primarily on popu-
larity, 01' on personal likes or dislikes,
althu it is that

the very
that
winners ill order
to win the awards must necessarily
make them popular members oi the
suldent body, There are no condi-
tions (asked (all to the rote. The vot-
ers are asked to vote ior those people
whom they honestly think bore been
of the greatest se , e to the college,
and they should vote only after a carer
ful consideration oi the
men and women oi the senior class.
Some people maybe inclined to give
this election n passing thoughi and
drop it from their minds as being one
at the numerous elections around
school which don’t particularly Con-
earn the whole student body. TO our
way of thinking this is the highest
honor

that can come to n man or
it is a.
recognition coming from the isculty
and uppel‘classmen oi inilbiul and un-
tiring efforts directed toward the ser—
Vice of nne’s class, college, and fel-
low students. What could be a great-
er honor than such an award, for af-
ter all shouldn't service be the object
oi oil that We do?

Those who are to vote on this inat-
ter have on obligation to discharge
and a duty to periorl-n. Their obligo-
tion is to the men and women who
deserve this recognition: their duty
is to be sure to Vote, ﬁrst oi all, and

' then to vote intelligently and with o
consciousness oi the honor that is be-

they vote. ,
