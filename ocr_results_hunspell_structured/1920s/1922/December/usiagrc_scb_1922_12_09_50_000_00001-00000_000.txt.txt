Complete statistics of the grades

:or the moment the campus is all
agog over ths usually neglected sub-
ject 0n the whole the results ob-I
tamed are considerably lower than‘
those made last year at this time but
this may perhaps be explained by the
raising of the standards of the school
this year under the new elective sys,
tem. ,

Probably the most interesting item
in the statistics is the marked super-
iority of the Quaditcs over the in-
habitants oi the Dorms. The average
grade for the women is as while that
of the men is 29, or a dilisrcnce of
about 30% in favor of the coeds.
Facility members say that a certain
per cent is usually expected in favor
of the women but are unable to ac-
count for the large margin which
these.i~csults show.

result of next season, Coach Elward
is conﬁdent enough to forecast games

Deﬁnes Idealism as Belief That
World Is Mental In Substance
Rather Than Physical.

PHILOSOPHICAL IDEALISM
IS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE

Distinct Connection Between
Otherness of Nature and
Otherness of Society.

The puilosaphicdl and ubjective
sides on Idealism were the topics dis-
cussed by Proiessor William E. Hock-

‘ing. Harvard Exchange Professor, in
the Seventh and eighth of his series
01' lectures delivered in chapel Thurs-
day and F idoy,
"Idealism," as defined by Professor

cial Club to back the proposition, and 1924 Team Meets Defeat Second HOCking- “is the belief that the world

is in its substance mental rather than
physical, that the ultimate realities
‘ul'e not physical but menial in char-
acter." The fundamenml question in-
volved is, “of what is the world
medal" The philosophy of Idealism,
which is in reality, "Idea 0 ism, the
“1" being added for euphony," is made
up of two parts positive and negative,
according to Professor Hocking, The
negative part of metaphysical Ideal-
ism holds that the apparent self suf-
ﬁciency of nature is illusory. The
positive holds that nature dependslon
the mind.
Seli Sufﬁciency of Nature

Haring deﬁned this philosophy Pre-
fessor Hocking proceeded to give a.
few impressions which this' particular
type calls forth. He then took up the
ldealist's argument in regard to the.,
illusory character of the apparent
self sufficiency of nature. They‘hnld
the facts of nature are not independ»
ent but principles of nalure‘ bound up
in each other and since separate
things are not independent they rear
son the same is true for all nature.
Using an example of the perception
of the moon by the human eye, Pro—
fessor Hocking pointed out'that the
moon cannot be the cause of the per—
ception and the perception at the same
time because that would be “saying
that cause and effect are ldenucal. -
By reducing to an absurdity the argu—
ment that the moon as a part of
natul'e‘ is independent of us. th'e

In the Quadrangle Cottage ﬁve
carried oif high honors with 42 points,
Cottage three fell at the bottom of
the list with 32. Dibble Hall barely
nosed out Smith by one point and
Smith in turn only had a point ad—
vantage over Clark. The race be-
tween these thrce buildings should
afford considerable interest during
the remainder of the semester.
Langa'n and Four tied for the booby
prize among the men's halls with 26
points apiece to their cred .

The literan‘ societies made
cellent records and showed a con-
sistent margin over the average in
both the men's and women’s societies.
Ellis topped the list» among the gn‘rls
with Aegi Philadelphia and Caloca-
gothie trailing closely behind. Forum

with 2. score of 41 points, Eight.
points behind Fol-urn came Institute
and chi-estomathia with 33 points
apiece. Ionian was a close fourth‘
with 31 counters.

'l‘illhﬂﬁ: Individual lender.
The highest individual record made_
duringthis half of the semester was
90 points made by John Talbott. This
is equivalent to 18 hours of A work,
an unusual record. The lowest record
Was a minus 36. For propriety s sake
the name of this student is withheld.
Among the girls, nne girls had 80
points, six had it or more, eighteen
had so or mnre, making 25 girls with
an average well above so points.

exr

Scoring was based on a scale of 5
points for each hour oi A grade, 3
for B, 2 for C, D for D, and minus 3
for every hour of E. This policy or
the publication of grades aroused
considerable rivalry among different
groups on the campus last year and
it is hoped that the competition will
serve to r se the average materially

negative part of the lrlcallsts philoso-
phy is established. .

Taking up the positive part, Pro—
fessor Hocking presented the’ reason-
ing of idealism as tollows. Besides
perception in our ml‘nd there is mem-
ory and we cannot tell Where the one
leaves off and the other begins. There
is thus a continuity. it must he ad-
mitted that the past is clearly manual
but since the present is continuous
with the past, is not. the present'really
past? There is ' in the present
thought and thoughts are lugntal. ”I've
not only see but We interpret and the
more we think the more we come
to the reality.

Each Person is a Pcrccivcr.
Professor Hocking does not believe

3"“ that the negative part of Idealism

which disprovcs the self sufficiency
DI nature Can be gotten away from
because it is substantiated. However
he does not believe that the positive
side is satisfied because each person
is a perceiver and we could have as
lnﬂlly Worlds as (here are persons.
The logic proves too much for i can.
not perelcve you if pou are a separate
world.

In repelling his lecture on the all-
jective side of idealism Professor
Hocking stated that he would attempt
to show how the defects of this View
of the world could be remedied and
'still remain in the general ﬁeld oi:
idealism, that nature depends on
mind, His purpose was to show that
some connection exists between the
jothcrncss oi nature and the otherness
of our other selves or society.

He then Went on to consider the
,dltlcrent theories as to how we know
each other as minds. Since we have
no sense organs to determine the ex»
istencc of minds in others we fall
back on the theory of analogy, which
according to Protesscr Hocking is
weak. The theory advanced by James
that we know other minds than our
