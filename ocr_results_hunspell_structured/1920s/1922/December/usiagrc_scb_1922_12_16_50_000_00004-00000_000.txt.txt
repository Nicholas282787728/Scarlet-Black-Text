' According; to the authorities at the
University or Southern Calitornia the!
reason that women have higher
scholastic standings than men is be—
cause they take easier courses, and
not on account oi any supposed higher
intelligence. Statistics show that wee
men average two hours less per sem—

Something more than 1,000 lnElnlh
iactiirers who are attending the
Liveniy—iitth annual convention or the
illinois hianuiacturcr's, association in
Chicago listened to an address by Dr.
E. A. Steiner Thursday evening at the

U. s, A,, retired, who is now president
of the Radio Corporation of Aierica;
Edward Price Bell, ior twenty-three
years manager or the foreign service
of American Manufacturer’s Foreign
Credit Underwriters.

The Chicago Daily Trihune, in com-
menting on the convention, says: "Dr,
Steiner’s indictment oi Ellis Island
was greeted as the sensation of the
convention." It gives a part of his
speech as follows:

“Ellis island,” said Dr. Steiner,
“Has become a prison, with nothing
to distinguish it from a Benal institue
lion, Urispcakaiile harharities have
been committed there. Due to the
rigor of the law, the fact that the ser-
vicc is iindennanned, and the oirlcials
underpaid, the commonest decehcies
are/denied personsot culture and new
tinerucnt, who suffer unnecessary tor-
lures.

“Persons who have escaped tilg‘ht-
iiil experiences. who have spent their
all ior this last throw of fortllnc's
dice. have been forced hack into the
dismal past from which they had as
caped, and only those who had politi-

hope,

migrant camm‘lsslol'l, would be El. wlse.
