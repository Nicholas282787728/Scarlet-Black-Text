Hocking Disc—unses the Realists
Criticism of Idealism in
His Monday Address.

PROFOUN‘D PHILOSOPHICAL
PROBLEMS ARE PRESENTED

“The Very Point of Realism’s 'At-
tack Leads Straight to
Idealistic View."

In the ninth of the series 01' lectures
given by Pluf. Hocking in Chapel on
“nullity he dealt mainly on the
"effect of realism on idealism."

Objective Idealism says ”as my own
self is to my own ideals and thoughts
50 God is to ills world." Everything
in the world is Connected with every-
thing else. It is possible to discover

the connection between God and?

nature by discovering what is done
nested with us, and although thought
and matter are two very different
things, they are closely related. It
is utterly impossible to evolve grad—
ually from matter to consciousness
but one can create a world of matter
from a world of mind, even as an
artist creates matter out, of his mind
in form of pictures or portraits. So
it might be said that matter is bound
up in the mind in so far .as the mind
has moral qualities.

An Idealist realizes his own in-
finity and thus realizes the infinity of
the world outside and although he
does not undersmnd the world he
does know the type of which it is
built thus realizing that he and the
world are akin.

Bealist Criticizes Idealism.

A Realist is the critic of Idealism
Prof. Hocking hrst attacks the theory
of connectedness. it can be infer—
red from the effect to the cause that
the external relations are lust as im-
portant as the internal) relations, but
one can not examine the units or ele-
mets.ol the world and know what sort
of 1world the entire thing is. The
spirit of the realist is that we can
not assume a universal connected-
ness, nor can we argue a thought to

an object, nor from nature to God, 1

thus the whole idealistic philosophy
falls down. This theory might be
called the argument of “Nothing-but."

Idealism accepts a good deal of1

realistic philosophy, such as the ex-
ample of the primrose reveals all
nature and God, but the realist af—
firms that the primrose is merely a
primrose. The "egocentric—predica—
ment," invented by Prof. Perry: states
"that one can not think of anything
without thiking of lt," but this does
not prove that here are no things that

we do not think of, as every thought1

must have a. thinker.
Objective Sinndm'ds.
There is only one way in which an

individual can stand on his feet anal

say "humanity must come to my
point of view." and that is that he has
objective standards.
philosophy of "Nothing—but" toward

1 all things in the universe. Mr. Hock.
ing gives an example of this theory
by the study of the ease of Good and
Evil. It is not true to say that ell-ll
is here because God wants it, for we
do not Want to get into any protec-
this attitude toward God.

Realism says that Idealism would
favor and protect the evil and as
such has pernicious influences. This
indictment of evil is one Of the best
things that Realism has done.

The question has been often asked.
"IS Evil Evil and nothing else?"
the shadow of War there are things
that happen that seem to be pure evil,
but nevertheless it is true that (tn??-
thing, from. which we can learn a les-
son is not pure ev-li.

Prof. Hocking says, "The very
point of the Realists most bitter st-

tack brings him tto the back door of ,

Idealism."

It Is 1Tacit1y Understood That
She Will Not Interfere
With French Plans.

France has apparently emerged vic—
torious from the London conferecne
in so far as her proposed occupation
of the Ruhr is concerned. At least
the French. Italian, and Belgian dele-
gates to the premiers’ conference
left yesterday for their homes with
the melt understanding that England
would not interfere in France’s policy
of aggression It is understood that

‘England, although disapproving of the
_step France plans to fairs on the ﬁrst
‘of the year. will sit tight and let 1

France beat the consequences of her
action. ,
TURKEY

With the removal of British censor-
ship on outgoing cables, new rumors
:0! strife in the Near East are reach-
ing the united States. The latest re,
port is that the Eritish and Turkish

representatives are carrying on secret '

negotiations in regard to the all—im~
pomut oil Question. It is understood
that.thcsc negotiations are arousing
the displeasure of thd Russian soviet
government. From present indlca»
tion, the ﬁnal settlement of the straits
question is as yet tar distant.
RUSSIA
The Moscow disarmament confer-
ence is on the verge of disruption.
The delegates to the disarmament
conference secnl perfectly willing to
agree to anything but disarmament.
Russia has taken the lead for a
material Cut in the armies and navies
of the Eastern Euporcan countries,
but she stands practically alone. Pu—
land and the Baltic states propose a
nonrngl'essive pact with the provision
that disarmament shall be discussed
later. Russia has refused to accept
this plan, which she considers evasive
and extremely unsatisfactory.

prince, John Wanamaker, died yester-

maker was the most famous of the‘

Glee Club.

Foul home games and a Thanksgiv—
ing contest with Creighton University
at Omaha are the high spots on the
Grinnell 1923 football schedule. Par-
sons College opens the season for the'
Pioneers here, while the other home
s include games with brake, the
Kansas Aggles, and (Joe. The Goo
game, although not definitely ﬁxed,
Tis an annual affair and will probably
be arranged .

i Coach Knute Rockne of Notre Dame,
in answering Coach Elward’s letter
asking for a date next fall, said that/
he had already nxed his schedule for ,
1923, but offered Crinnell a date for
the year following.

The game with Creighton on Turkey
day is settled except,for signing the
contract, it was imderstood Tuesday.
It was arranged by ‘Doc’ Huff at
Kansas City last week end while ate
tending the meeting of athletic rep-
resentatives of the Missouri valley
conference. Creighton has been
recognized by the conference as ,a -
whole, and several valley schools
schodue. "

Washington University and Asses
are the two valleyschools which the
Pioneers will meet on their home
iields, while the annual Cornell
fracas will be played at Mt Vernon

This leaves Crinneu with the stif-
lest schedule it has played in several
years, and also with a good assort-
ment of home games. The Drake
game has been moved from Des
Molnes, and should prove a tremend-
ans drawing card at the proposed
homecoming. The Kansas Aggie ,
|will be a battle of coaches us well
as of teams, because Charles nach-
mnn, the Aggie mentor, was one of
Elwards team- mates at Notre name
in 1914—15.

Although Carleton College at Nortlp
ﬁeld, Minnesota, has written‘zor a
game, it is unlikely that their re“
quest will be granted, because of an
already complete schedule. Coach El-
ward announced today that! there
would be three weeks spring practice.
followed by a. game in which all men
out for the practice will be given a
chance to play.
