peoples. Many new nations were born

in the year t’ollm 'ng the war and then

newly elected representatives besieged

the Paris peace conference for recog-

nition in accordance llltll Wi son's

principle of self-determination. ‘Many

of these newly created states were

mere hoaxes and others died in mer—

est infancy, asserted the speaker, but

this “Renaissance of free peoples" is

suniinai-izcd by the following ﬁgures:

in 191i Europe contained 26 states, 21

monarchies and 5 republics; in 1922

Europe contains 35 states, to Diane

archies and 19 r‘enub' Prof. Lord

declared that the one feature common

to all the ne wEuropean countries is

that they are all national gates, based

upon the principle that every fully

formed nationality in Europe has the

right to dccidc its own political affili-

ation and the most natural use of that
right is to form an independaht state,
in other words, the principle of self-
determination.

in discussing the factors that lle--
tel-mine nationality,<Pi-of. Lord pre-
sented H. G. Wells deﬁnition of a na-
tion as "any association, confusion, or
mixture of people afflicted by or wlsLlrl

div so and uncertain. According to‘
the speakcr, carccly any nation is‘
racially homogeneous; linguistic llllr
ity, pltiio a more practical critcr n,
breaks down when aplied to Belgium
and Switzerland Religious, histori—
cal, and geographical unity all liclp
to form a nationallr conscious pcoplc,
but concluding the d , on of, this
point the speaker ‘ls‘ rted that “the
one doc-ding test is the unity of feel-
ing of the people. Nationality is some
tlihi subjective. A nalitllllll people
must be conscious of a feeling of core
potato lilo.’

Tlic lecturer traced brieﬂy the llis~
tory of ti 5 spirit of nationalism from
its or in the Flellch Revolution,
tllru i effects on control Europe in
the nineteenth century, down to thc
cnicrgcnco of the pew ,tutts in cast-
ern Europe as a result at the late
war. A few of the objections to this
doctrine of nationality were prcscntod
such as: (1) The dllficulty of fleterinr,

It took man 300,000 years to begin
to connect with the forces of life. It
was only three of four thousand years
ago that he began to come into a con—
sciousness of the powers which the
world has in storel for him. He was
blind to them for milleniuins before
hat. When he did come to conscious—
lnoss it blossomed into a magniﬁcance
‘that ls\astonishing. But it is a his-
‘grace to man that he is not yet fully
awake to the powers that have been
given him. He is as blind and ignor-
ant of the facts of living as were his
ancestors of three or four thousand
years ago. In conclusion President
Main said, “Trutb,‘rightcousness, and
love are the things around which Lhe
world revolves and it is time to lie-

gnn to get a glimmering of an idea of
this."
