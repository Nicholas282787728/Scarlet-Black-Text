LEXll SUlTOli/l' 0n Ql‘I'l‘ liICliIh
Last Saturday evening was the date‘
of the presentation or one of the lrcst‘
plays that Glillnell people will hare,
an opportunity of seeing this y \l'.

At the same time the college put on
an open house at the dormitoric .‘
Consequently, the play was poorly at-
tended. and many students who wish-
ed to see the play sacrificed that,
pleasure that the open house might
be it success. This is unfair to those}
who are making a special effort this
year to bring high class theatrical:
productions to Grilmell. It would al-
most seem that the college is willfully
competing with the management of
the local theaters, and yet we are all
ways ready to protest when interior-1
productions are oftered. From thei
standpoint of enjoyment the open ,
house Saturday night was s success:l
but if those who are most often \t'onti
to criticise theatrical productions in'
Gl'innell show no‘ inclination to lend
their support when high class plays,
are presented, then it is at least time
that they stopped criticising. I

Every one knows that a theater in'
Grinncll can never afford to offer‘
shows of the class represented by:

of the students and faculty or the coir,

We admit that the adverti

somewhat deceptive. and this might
be one justification for bucking the
play; but, as has been suggested by!

Grinnell's prominent business

g for ,

one of
men, the administration should make
it a point to ﬁnd out what the play is‘

before bucking it. If the prodllclioll_

is a worthy one, then the students_
