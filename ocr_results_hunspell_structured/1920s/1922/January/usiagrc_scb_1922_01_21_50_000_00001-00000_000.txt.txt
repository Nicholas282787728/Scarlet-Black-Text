SCHOLARSHI? OF ALL

The report that President
would speak on ”Grades" in chapel
Thursday morning caused enough in<
terest among the students to draw one
of the largest chapel crowds of the
year. The college office had prepar—
ed statistics on.the grades of the stu-
dent body as a whole and of each of

. the various campus organizations.

’08]? and Gown Lends
Contrary to the statement made by

President’Main Thursday ‘mornlng,,_

the lnntern does not ronlt first among
campus organizations. Cap and Gown,
is at the he of the list with an 32%

perfect score. The Lantern is ﬁrst

among modal organizations with 67%.
The ﬁgures given by President Main
for the girls Thursday morning rep-
resented the,numher at points out of
a possible 15, while the ﬁgures he
gave for the men represented the per-
cenmge of points out of a passihle475.
According to the new figures the
League Board is second with 73%.
and 3. girls third with 69% and the
Lantern fourth with 57%. ,

The ﬁgures were computed on the
sme basis as that used by Phi Beta
Kappa, national scholastic society.
According to this plan A counts 5, B
counts 4 C counts 2, D counts minus
1 and E counts minus 4 Using fif—
teeu semester hours as a basis of
computation, the highest possible rate
lg would be 75 and the lowest minus
60. As a matter of fa‘ct, one man chr-

rying 16 hours of work with straight . ,

A grade moxie a rating or so, while at
the other end or, the scale a solitary
studentfl) had a minus 49 to his cred-
lm
in percentage ot the possible 75 points,
so they may sound rather low. Upon
careful consideration it will be scen‘
that percentage of 40% or 50% may

include an equal distribution of A's,-

B’s and C's to the individuul’s credit.
which can he considered a’ very fair

average.
The men average 28 out of c pose

sible ’lS points for a percentage of,

3". A study of 249 men was made as

to the effect of smoking on scholar‘v‘

ship. of this number 41% burned ins
cense before the shrine of Nicotine,
and the other 59% were non-smokers.
The smokers averaged 27%
and the non-smokers 43%.
Dibble Hull Heads Dorms ‘
Dibble Hall heads the list for the
mens dormitories with a percentage
of 50, while Building Three is at the

. bottom of the list with 24%. Cottage

Two leads the quadrangle with 53. 7%
while Central brings up the rear with
l") 5%..

Non resident men not living in the

dormitories rated 35% and the men
who live at home in town drew 30%.
Chresta leads men's literary societies
with 55%. The others stood as fol—

‘ lows Forum, 53%; Ionian, 45%; In—

stitute,_ 44%.
A study of the football men showed

that they stood just 2% below the dy‘c
erage for the whole student body with
35%. Employees of. the college avA
eraged 37%. In all there were 31
men having 9. minus percentage.

‘ STAFF FINANCIAL

The much touted ﬁnancial depics.
siou has evidently railed to depress
the amorous inclinations of Grinnell'
men. As a. result of repeated rumors
that have filtered into this office con-
cerning a tightening of the dating
market, the editor dispatched your car—
respondent last Wednesday on a tour
of investigation. A goodly number of
college belles, near—belles, and dumb-
bella were interviewed. The inter-
view went something like this in ev-
ery instance:

Your correspondent:

date Friday?"
She: “Certainly.”

Y. C. “Have you a date for setup
day." ‘ .

She: “Why, of course."

Y. C. “How long have you been dat-
ed for the week-end?" \

She: "Oh, I don’t know," (business
of yawning) "long time, I gues

Y. 0.: “Thank you."

She: (languidly) "Oh, don't menv
tion it."

It is readily evident from the above
even to the lay ohseiwer, that bearish
tendencies of the market which char-
actarized it during the early fall, have
entirely disappeared. This can be
easily accounted tor by the rapid ab-

Missouri Valley outdoor meet which
' is to be held this year at Lawrence
