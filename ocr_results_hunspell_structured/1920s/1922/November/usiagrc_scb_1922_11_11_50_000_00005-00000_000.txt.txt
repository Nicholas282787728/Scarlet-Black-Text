"THE lllCTATOIt"

The internal disturbances of cer-
tain romutic cud ebullient South
American republics," which hcvc lor
years furnished the American nrcss
(Ind humorous writers with material
[or exciting dispatches or clever, hu-
morous discussions, were placed in the
hall Elf lame by the plays of the late
Richard Hui-drug Ditvls, who was \’il'-
tually their literary spokesman.

"The Dicmtor," which is shown
(ti: the Strand Theatre tonight
as £| Paramount offering With Wallace
Reid in the star role, is one of thls
type by this author. It is (he play

which Willie Collier made famous Dnl

the stage and one in which Mr. Davis
paints an exclﬁng pinture of Volcanic
life in the LatinAAmel'ican continent.

“JIANSLAUGIITER”

Cecil )3. Del lllc’s remarkable
Pal-amount production. "Manslaugh-
ter,” will be shown at the strand
theatre next week. Thom: Meighah,
Leatrlce JOY and Lois Wilson have
the leading roles. .

“PEGGY minim.”

Not in muons has such a succegsful
Irish song play been written as
"Peggy O‘Neil,” and very few suCh
plays have given the satisfaction it
does. Packed with thlills, suspense,
laughs, somedy and romance, the
three acts Of “Peggy D'Neil” recog-
nizes no dullness.

Coming to the Colonial theatre, for

'ous night only, Tuesday, November

14, theatregoers can prove to their
own‘ satisfaction iust why “Peggy
O'Neil" is such a. successful stage at-
traction. Just as it has pleased BVEI‘yA
Where, so will it please in Grinnell.

A capable cast headed by ELhel
Romayne as "Peggy" and Tommy
O'shane' the romatic Irish tenor, as
“Bob Stephenson," interprets “P933!

“ll You Believe it, It’ SO," is also a
ﬁne picture. And this some star, will
be seen hcrc soon in that g ppiug
story of Alice Ducr Millers, “Man-
slaughter." This name might be mis—
leading to those not familiar with
the story. It is c story 01' u rich, idlc,
selfish girl who is a “speed mcniac"
and is in the habit oi mining the
police. One dity she runs down and
kills a. trullic mun. It happens that
the district attorney, is her lover. He
docs his duty. and shc is sent to serve
u long sentcncc for manslaughter.
The effect of prison liic on hcr chur-
acter, is o story in itself, but she
ﬁnally emerges, o rscl woman, instead
of the society butterﬂy she had been.

011 the fourteenth, that popular
wholsomc llttlc spoken ploy, “Peggy
O'Neil," will he at the Colonial. The
song, "Peggy O'Neil," and also "Silver
Thrccds Among the Gold,” will be
lectured.

This committee would like to say a
word of explanation of the column.
Please do not think thst the only
plays rccmnmondcd here are those
teaching at moral lesson. Some times
those very plays are so bad artistical-
ly, that nothing can he said in their
(avor. '

Play, photography, noting, in a.
word, ihc drnmcllc veluc of the pro»
duction. is the chief consideration. It
is d gratifying thing hcwcvcr, flint
we seldom have now, in either house,
c rcolly objectionable picture.
