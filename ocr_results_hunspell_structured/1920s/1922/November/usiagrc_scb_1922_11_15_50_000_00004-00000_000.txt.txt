ing lnitde by Drake in the Ames game
was decidedly reassuring to Pioneer
hopes. However, since the Cornell
shine the Pioneers have completely
lost. faith in dope and they believe
mat the only way to decide the Drake
game is not on paper but by ﬁghting
during every minute of the game on
Saturday.

For several Pioneers this will be
the last game in which they will have
an opportunite to \veztr the Scnl‘llel.

ed to put up the best bottle of their
careers against their ancient rival.
For some other men this game will be !
a chance to win their spin-s as grid-
iron ﬁghters. And for every men on

which they have looked forward since

Howard and Thorup are also evenly
