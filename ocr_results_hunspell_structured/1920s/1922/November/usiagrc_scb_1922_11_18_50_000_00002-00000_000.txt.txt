the early part at the season the Drake

two weeks ago, but the Drake team is
reported to have developed Consider-
ably since its pour showing against
Washington and the Pioneers will
prohahly have to step a lively pace

Colman, the Drake ace, pushed Capps
hard in the Washington dual, who in
turn ﬁnished close behind Meyer and
Mcilrath in the Grinncll meet. Drake
also has several other veteran long

jiensc and delcnse. Max Hnwnrui ol
‘Dslzaluosa, has been showing up at
‘tackle, and his dcrensive play-ins has
lat times made things miserable for the
:varsity backﬁeld. Merritt Scharn-
wcher has becn playing a mod defen-
‘sivc game at end, but needs training
‘on the cliensc as he played backﬁeld
in high school.

! The baclrhcld probably is stronccr
proportionately than the line, altligrzh
there are many promising candidates
tor both line and backﬁeld. Mack
‘Frienil and Martin have been calliuc

‘candidates for the lllllrlmck position

in: the best. Morris, powerful]
guard or tackle, was lorccd to quit
‘the squad when he broke his collar-
honc over a month age. There are
inlenty of euds. Scharnweher, Dun-
ning, hixler, Johnston, and Turner
have been trading around on the end
Ipositions. Andrews, Jackson and
Jones have been shifting around at
various line positions.

The entire freshman ioothall squad
1will be taken to the Drake game as
a result of cooperative plan evolved
in a meeting or the 1926 team this
lweek. It is always customary to take
1thc largest part of the squad on the
Des Moines trip at the end of the sea—
