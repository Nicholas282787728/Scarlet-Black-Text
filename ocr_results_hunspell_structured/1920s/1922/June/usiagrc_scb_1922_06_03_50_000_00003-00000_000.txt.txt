The story of electrical development begins
in the Research Laboratories.

Here the ruling

In this manner are

sooner or later ﬁnd ready application.

industries that cluster around
the electrically driven battle-
the trolley cars and electriﬁed railways

that carry millions, the lamps that glow in homes
and streets, the household conveniences that have

d women of drudgery, the labor-saving

electrical tools of factories, all owe their existence,

at least, to the'co—ordinated efforts of the
nds who daily stream through this gateway.
