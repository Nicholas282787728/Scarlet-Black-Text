Tulll RE GIlAI) iTIN

Yesterday was a memorable day in
the lives of all the seniors, Many 0i
them faced a professor in the class
room for the last lime in their lives,
and it was with a mixture OI regret
and happiness that “my left the reel-
tation hall. Certain it is that their
undergraduate days are over.

Young men and women all over the
the country, thousands of them, are
going thru the same thing at this time.
and it is indeed remarkable how fast
the number lsvincreasing every year.
We are going forward, in an educa-
tionol why at least, at a fast pace. Not
very uinny years ago o college educe-
tionpas considered more or less of it

in general is looking to college men

and women for leadership. They will

not be received with open arms, so
they tell us, hub if they can prove that

they have capacity for constructive
work and enlightened leadership then
they may take their places alongside
of those men and women who haVe cl.

TO THE UNDERCLJSSMEN.

The seniors will soon be gone: and
with the close of omminoiions we will
(all advance one step iarther toward
the goal which they have reached. As
we leave school for the summer Vacs;
tion it is important and even imperc—
tive that every Grinnelllan remember
the college which is ours and keep a
watchful eye on high school men and
women who would make good Gl'inuel-
liens. Without attempting to boost
we can in all sincerity say that Grin-
nell has been recruiting her new stur
dents from among some of the bent
men and women in the high schools

the present student hotly to see that
the good work is kept up.

that high school students in every one

However much we mnv kick neniust

which it is a port, nnd it should oer-A
taillly be true or Gl'innell. Graduates
and friends ol the college tell us thet
we can not realize how well Griuncll
stands among institutions or its kind.
Graduates who have been attending
school in the east come back and say
that Grinnell is better known there
than most of the eastern colleges.

We have a school to be proud of and
one which every Grinnelllan should
he more than glad to recommend to
prospective studuents. The student
body must be partly responsible Ior
perpetuating itself, and we must re-
member that we are a wulking adver-
