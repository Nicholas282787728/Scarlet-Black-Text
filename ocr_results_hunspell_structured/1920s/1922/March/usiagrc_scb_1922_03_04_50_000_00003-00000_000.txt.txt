the new will Rogers picture, "Doube
ling tor Romeo," is shown. in this
Goldwyn picture, which was wriitrn
hy Elmer Rice and directed iry Clul'v
ence Badger. all the subtitles were
written hy \Vlll Roger

tionally known as an ori

ist, and his titles are said to be the
lunnlcst parodies on Shakespeare ever-
written.

The story tells the trials at a bash—
[ul cowhoy lover to win the allcctions
of a western girl. But she has ”ino—
ne" ideas ahout a lover, and sends
her cowhoy to the “movies" to learn
how to make love. What happess to
him there, as well as his adventures
as a cowboy Romeo, makes this lat—
cst Rogers picture one of the most do»
lightiul comedies that Goldwyn has
ever produced.

Many remarkably ﬁne settings in
"Doubling ior Romeo,” such as the
ballroom and balcony scenes, were
designed by Cedric Gibons of the
Goldwyn art department.

PIONEERS COME FROM
CELLAR IN PIKE GAME

(Continued from Page One)
played a. slashing game at guard but
in spite of his spirited style of play
did not make a single foul.

Grinncll Opens Scoring

Grinnell tool: the luiﬁative in the
scoring when Benz dropped a free
thrown through the ring and followed
with 3 held goal. Thompson then
counted the Plkel"s ﬁrst score with
a free throw. A pass from Crltchet to
Benz irorn out or hounds resulted in
another counter for Grinnell. A
doulrle foul was then made good by
thh Thompson and Benz. A ﬁeld
goal by Macy gave the Pioneers the
long and or a 11 to 2 score. But a
long ringer by Cl'istol seemed to turn
the tide in favor of the visitors when
he followed up his ﬁrst attempt with
another short basket which was in
turn duplicated by Johnson, putting
the count at 11 to s. Macy then made
another flying raid down the floor and
sunk a pretty ringer but the Pikers
replied with another basket by Cris—
tal and two free throws hy Johnson.
Three more Counters from the foul line
by Benz completed the scoring 0! the
half with the score huard reading 16
to 12 in favor of the Pioneers.

Fearing Starts Rally

Fearing lnaugui'aled'a little rally
all his own in the ﬁrst few minutes
of the second half when he caged two
attempts from the ﬁeld. A long rings
er by Crltchet and a short basket by
Benz following a clever piece of team
work put the score at 25 to 13. Goals
by Thompson Macy, Thumser and
Benz increased the score without EiV~
lug either side any advantage. At
this point the Pioneers broke loose
again and two deid goals by Benz and
one by Fearing out the game out Of
danger. From here on the game tend-
ed to be rather rough and Janssen,
Schnauss, Benz and Cristol went out
in quick succession. Scoring then was
about evenly divided until the crack
of the gun announced the end of the
game With the ﬁnal count standing at
41 to 26.

Thumser, clisol and Thompson
stood out for tile visitors. Thompson
was kept closely guarded at all times
and contributed most of his points by
the free throw method.

Both sides resorted to many long
range shots and both missed a con»
slderable number which should have
been made good. With 6. little better
luck in hitting the hoop the Pioneers

could easily have increased their mar.
gin to a much higher ﬁguie.
