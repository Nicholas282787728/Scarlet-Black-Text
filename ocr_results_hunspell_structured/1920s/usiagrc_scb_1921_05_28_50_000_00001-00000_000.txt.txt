The year has been very suc—

bccd by the irumbei of men who par-

ticrputed in the good natured building(

‘honors by being winner in two sports,
basketball and football. Four comes
‘lwbt with first place iii the indoor-
baseball matches. Outdoor haseball‘
and tennis are not yet completed.

Although the inter-dorm football
games last run were not instigated by

r, holler-s, head of intra—mural ath-
lv cs but by the men themselves.
much interest was taken in them and‘
they were considered a success. As a
result ol’ no supervision by the athletic
department, there was no regular
schedule of games and the records of
those that were pliayed were not kept.
Building Three emerged victors from
tbe games but further than that, nolhs
ing is obtainable in regard to the con-
tests. ‘

Building Three also won the basket-
ball series. Several close games were
played in this series and many plays
crs were given the chance to show
their ahility‘to toss the ball through
the hoop. The standing of tlle teams

final game but who his opponent will
be has not yet been decided. The
tournament is conducted in the form
or an elimination contest; as soon as
a player is defeated, he is dropped

losing their lives in the excitement.
It so happened that the Eu oughs
party were headed for borne from the
lake and betorc they knew it they
were in the midst ot a drove of pork-
crs. They ran over- two lecture the
Car could be stopped.

Tire scene now changes to one or
action. The farmers gathered about
the car and much talk ensued. Just
as things were getting back to nor-
nialcy, along came the roadster and
smashed into the drove from the
north. This is the place Where the
two bogs lost their lives,

We now go to the police station,
and Jim Clark steps into the play.
They wanted Jim to go down to the
