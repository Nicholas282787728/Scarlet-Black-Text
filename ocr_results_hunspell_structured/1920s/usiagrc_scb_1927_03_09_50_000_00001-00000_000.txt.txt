Third-year Women 1‘ 1 Easy Victims
to Galloping Representatives
of rcarliiig Class.

Playing their first intel‘class gamc
of the season, the freshman women’s
basketball team yesterday rompcd
away for an easy victory over the
iiiniors by a score of 34.12. After gct-
ting away wilh a rush the props kept
possession of the hall throughout
most of the game and prevented the
juniors, in spite‘ of frequent rallies.
from cutting down their lead. The
game started with a scoring spurt by
the freshmen. who piled up 18 points
during the ri st half. A desperate
rally by the juniors in the second
quarter gave them 9 points. the half
ending with a score of 18-5 During
the second half the‘ freshmen repeat-
odly broke away to score, while fast
work by the prop centers prevented
the upper-class torwar-dsfrom getting
their hands on the ball.

Teget and Wilder, freshman cont-
crs, were the bulwark of their team,
their accurate passes and speedy foot-
work belng features of the game.
Kelch and Thomas consistently outs
ran their guards and found the hoop
with deadly accuracy. Dow, junior
captain, displayed her usual fight at
running center and her plucky play-
ing during the last half made her out»

Last spring's hat, discarded in

looking interesting alter a. winter of

potato chute (and like-wise the
League hoard) are doing a rushing

,With Grinn‘ell;

Ask For Release

many wcllrknolin men on its alumni
roll. Hayes is looked upon as one
of the grcatcst athletes who ever coni—
‘pctcd for Marietta. where he was a
star in football and basketball.

The compelling reason which has
caused him to ask for a release from
his Grinnell duties, was the recent
death of his' father. leaving Mr.
Hayes mother a widow. Marietta is
the home of both Coach and Mrs.
Hayes. and the former has had a flat-
tering offer to enter business therc,
in :tdditlon to his college duties. This
is a practice not [orbldden by the
Ohio confercnce. of which Marietta is
a member.

Has winning Itecoril

Hayes came to Grinnell at‘ the be-
ginning of the present school year,
succeeding “Doc" Huff as athletic
director and Charles Black as has—
ketball coach. Prior to that time he
was for three years hcad instructor
in the coaching school of the Univer—
sity of Michigan, and for five years
athletic coach at'the McClain Memor-
ial high school. Greenfield, Ohio. At
the latter institution his football and
basketball tcams won an almost uri—
broken succession of championships.

Although Hayes basketball team
iinishcd iii the cellar of the Missouri
Valley conference this winter. it is
recognized everywhere that insuper—
ahlc handicaps made this inevitable.
Hayes has gained the good will of
the whole body of Gl'irmell athletes.
of all the students. and oi: a vast
number or alumni who appreciate hls
service in placing the athletic de-
partment on an organized basis. Ear
es is the sixth member of the
local athletic staff to resign during
the past three years! The others in-
clude H. J. Huff, now track coach at
Kansas university; Mark w. Hyland,
former acting foothall coach; Charles
Black, now head basketball coach at
the University of Nebraska; Paul Mac-
Dcchron. now head foothall coach at
Oberlin college. and Raymond W.
Rogers, now athletic director at St.
John’s c'ollege. Maryland.

President Main announces that no
action has been taken either in select-
ing a new football coach or athletic
director.
